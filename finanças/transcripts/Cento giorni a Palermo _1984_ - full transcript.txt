July 21, 1979. Boris Giuliano, head of the quick interventions team in Palermo, Has a mysterious encounter at bar Lux. Until now, Giuliano pursued a very well-planned career. He researches the entry of the Sicilian mafia as a frontrunner, Into the international drug market, The consequences and movement of illegal amounts of money, Which are necessary to purchase and refine illegal drugs, And the network and markets in America and Europe. In cooperation with the F.B.I., he has set his sights on Michele Sindona, The mafia's banker. He was killed, he was killed, he was killed. September 25, 1979. Cesare Terranova. Judge. Former member of parliament. Active for many years in the anti-mafia parliamentary commission. Then he decided to return to Sicily as magistrate. Now he oversees the important task to lead Palermo's tribunal. He explicitly declared, his intention to strengthen the fight against the mafia, Resolve the close ties between the mafia and its financial sectors, as well as the links between the mafia and the political system. January 6, 1980. Piersanti Mattarella, Christian Democrat. President of Sicily. He summarized his government plans with a simple phrase: The region which has its house in order. It seemed just a simple phrase, But Piersanti Mattarella, Began to check the budgets of the individual departments. He ordered the inspection of contracts, that allowed for the construction of municipal schools. Finally, he said that the law should be equal for anyone, To allow for an absolute authority, which in itself is a radical change. Help! Help! Stop! Don't shoot! Piersanti, Piersanti. Help! August 6, 1980. Judge Gaetano Costa. Chief prosecutor of the Italian Republic in Palermo. The names of Bontade, Inzerillo, Spatola families and the banker Sindona, and various mafia bosses are closely associated with his name. As well as his investigations into Giuliano, Terranova, and president Mattarella. In May 1980, police stumbles upon a clan of heroin traffickers. The Sicilian prosecutors don't validate the arrest warrants. Procurator Costa does sign the warrants. It's a well-known secret that Costa did sign the warrants. Over how many bodies have we cried that have died on our soil? Too many! The mafia has never murdered so high up. And when faced with these serious crimes, They contain serious impacts for the State. Do not attempt to make a political hypothesis, That would create links between these crimes, a link that was already obvious. The truth is, that today, we are confronted with mafia terrorism, As a reactionary tool to create dark images. What has the State done for you the last couple of years? - Nothing. Just words and promises. - Why was no one arrested? That's just how it is. Nothing has happened. Nothing is too little said. Why, wasn't our proposed anti-mafia legislation successful? And here, words, promises, and as a result, expect that anti-mafia legislation will be discussed in parliament for two years! Listen, honorable La Torre, what does this bill intend to do? This is very important. You need to know that today, our island, is the world's center of drug trafficking. Weapons, missiles, and extortion in every sector of our economy. What do we want to get out of our proposed legislation? We need our police force, and the magistrates, its power and instrumentation, to look inside the pockets of the mafia, because we have to discover their real financial gain. They steal everything from the poor people, from the honest people and the State. - Minister! - Congratulations, general. Thank you for accepting such an important task. I wasn't hard to accept. It will be hard to quit this uniform. I will be at your disposal for all that is necessary. Of course, I need help from the government. If you allow me, I have a few points I need to discuss with you. - Let's go to my office, prefect. - Thank you. Honorable La Torre, I have a question. Do you support general Dalla Chiesa's appointment as Palermo's prefect? More than that. These days, it takes a quantum leap from the State, to fight against the mafia. For you communists, a general, even a Carabinieri, isn't a general at all? Don't play with words, I know Dalla Chiesa for many years. He participated in our fight against the mafia when he was captain. Thus, he knows that defeating terrorism... Listen, don't forget, Nobody wins anything alone. Neither terrorism or the mafia. General Dalla Chiesa, when will you be confirmed as prefect in Palermo? When will you go to Sicily? Is it true that you have been granted extraordinary powers? No comment. Can you confirm that you will coordinate the fight against the mafia? - Gentlemen, please! - I told the... One Hundred Days in Palermo He has arrived. Inform the Cavaliere. On guard! Present arms! Good day, dottore. Welcome. - We have dragged you to Sicily. - Don't worry. I was already in Europe. I would have come anyway. - Where did you get off the boat? - Costa Smeralda. It is safer there. - I have a yacht if you would like. - With four fishermen! Rome. The ceremonial transfer of military power. General Dalla Chiesa wore his uniform for the last time. General Lorenzoni has been appointed as Dalla Chiesa's successor. Lieutenant Claudio Giunti, picket officer of the barracks. Present strength: 60 officers, 120 non-commissioned officers, and 1.200 soldiers. Thank you. Gu Ciaio has left. Hong Kong was a mess. Our colleagues in Hong Kong, please. The third supply of weapons has never arrived. It will arrive tomorrow morning. And credit? - We will send it along our usual routes, right? All right, first we want to know the opinion of our friends from New York. The organization can't afford to lose indispensable guarantees in Sicily. Our Maestro agrees as well. Yes. But the subordinates and services? We have already made our decision. - Sir? - Yes. We are worried about the future, For repercussions. What about the future? We managed to bring a hundred thousand people to Comiso! And about the General. - I can assure you the consequences will be absorbed. The target is the right one. Whoever wanted Dalla Chiesa will cool down, the same is true for the church. Here they attack me too. Listen, La Torre commits a serious political error, now that he is looking for alliances with the Christian Democrats. You are messing up plans of many people. The event in Comiso has created anxiety. When did something like that happen in Sicily? When? Some say that it is just a politically motivated protest against the Americans. A hundred thousand people from different political convictions, Of all ages, didn't unite to demonstrate against a country, but to defend peace, against the missiles, and against the mafia. I always say: "Wherever somebody is fighting the mafia, we need to be there". Pio, there is a motorcycle in the back that I don't like. Cowards, cowards! Don't act like this, Emanuela. Let's talk about it, calmly. - You have already decided. - I haven't decided anything yet. I only asked for a little bit of time, that's all. Carlo, tell me the truth. My presence weighs down on your work, right? What do you mean? That I make things more difficult, that I depend on you. Please, Emanuela, you can't say that, I can't bear hearing those words. It's like someone saying I accepted the appointment to become minister already. It isn't right. You're right. Excuse me! Excuse me! I find it very difficult. I can't bear to see you... leave all by yourself. It's hard to accept. Do you understand? Yes, because it has already happened to me 30 years ago, when I left for Sicily. I left my wife in Florence, she was pregnant. When I saw her again, Nando was already eight months old. - And it continued like that. - That's not right, do you see that? Do you understand that isn't right? I don't know if it is right or wrong. I don't know. But I do know that it is my life. Let's make those changes to the press release of La Torre. With the goal to create solidarity between the government and opposition? Yes, and to avoid malicious interpretations. Enter! - The beloved Dalla Chiesa. Take a seat! - Thank you. For the Communist Party telegram, Only my signature, without the qualification of minister. Sure. Don't worry. Dalla Chiesa, we have to await a better opportunity. No, they are not for anyone. I call them. When I come back from Palermo I have more time at their disposal. You will have a lot of meetings about your official appointment. I would also like to go to Palermo. Immediately. I believe that the murder of La Torre is linked to my nomination. If so, I must start my job as soon as possible. - Yes, you are right. I will reserve a seat for you on our governmental flight next to me. Thank you. No need, minister. We already booked a seat on a regular scheduled flight. I'm only here in Rome to inform you about my intentions. And also tell you that some of my tasks haven't yet been discussed. But, this is of no importance. Because I have full confidence in you, minister. Thank you, prefect. Welcome excellence. Did you have a good trip? I am Lo Verde, the head of your secretary. Nice to meet you. - Let's go excellence. There's a car and an escort. - Why? Are the taxis on strike? - Excellence! We will see you at the prefecture. And I told my son: "Take the driving test and then we will see." He took the exam, passed it, but we are still waiting for the driver's license. Why don't you make an inquiry? It's one of your civil rights. Yes, a right. Palermo's civil right is only on this road. It is the mafia. Nice to meet you! Thank you. Excuse me. Via Cavour, what number? - The prefecture. - The prefecture? Yes, enter via the courtyard. Christ! But you are general Dalla Chiesa. - Yes. It is general Dalla Chiesa! Prefect. Stop with the photos. Go away. - Excellence! - Let them be. My office? - This way, excellence. I'll guide you. Stop taking photos! Excellence, the three heads of the department. Dottor Lamantia, dottor Salemi, and dottor Torissi. - It's an honor to meet you. - Nice to meet you. All right, The first thing I personally want to check, is the security measures for judge Pio La Torre's funeral. With absolute urgency I need to meet with all the responsible authorities. I want to know all staff of the prefecture. That's all for now. Thank you. - Prefect. - I will do so, immediately. Lo Verde. Look, I didn't want to offend you at the airport. - No. - My opinion on the escorts. We talk about it at my house. Well, excellence. One more thing, Lo Verde, My desk. There. - There? - Yes. - Of course, excellence. - Thank you. Quick, open the gate, quick! - Welcome general. - Thank you. Where's captain Fontana? - He is on leave. He will be back in a week. - Inform me as soon as he arrives. - At your orders general. Carlo. Thank god! I was longing to hear from you. How are you? You have had a long day? Yes. It was a long day. Right now, I'm back in the barracks to rest. Yeah, the camp-bed is new, comfortable. Your camp-bed and your table. You have got all you wished for. Do you know why I like these rooms? Because it all resembles the various parts of a house. Do you understand? You have a strange voice, Carlo. What's up? Nothing. Well, I'm sorry that I didn't call you earlier. And this is strange as well! That you apologize! - I can't fool you. - Why? - Because you're very smart. - Emanuela, we need you here. Yes, I'm coming. - Carlo! - I heard it. We'll talk again. Lucky you, that I have to get going. - No, I'll call you back later. - Well, ciao! Thousands of Sicilians pay their final respects for communist parliamentarian Pio La Torre, And his driver, Rosario Di Salvo, murdered by the mafia on April 30. Flags are at half-mast and many banners against violence are visible. At the same time general Dalla Chiesa was appointed prefect of Palermo. He concluded the first official meeting with the investigative body. Secret services will also open inquiries into deaths of La Torre and Di Salvo. At 11 am, the funeral procession reached Piazza Politeama, greeted by lengthy applause. Pio will live forever, Pio will live forever! The funeral is expected to initiate an answer from the State, with regard to the mafia threat. So far it is positive. Present at the funeral are the most important members of parliament. President Pertini, president of the Chamber of Deputies Nilde Jotti, and the council president Spadolini. Even minister Formica has set-up a meeting, with regional commanders of Guardia Di Finanza (militarized police force), to discuss the economic and fiscal investigations. Communist party secretary, Enrico Berlinguer, commemorates La Torre's efforts to help evolve the island, and his relentless fight against the mafia. Pio La Torre was born in 1927, in a farmers family from Palermo, from Mazzo Monreale, several hundred meters, from the place he was found dead. Regional president of Sicily, Mario Daquisto takes the floor. Two years ago, we cried about Piersanti Mattarella's murder. Today we bow in front of Pio La Torre and Rosario Di Salvo. Killed by the same murderous hand. Their spirit, their will not to surrender, and not to arrive at this square, where the crowd has the certainty of the final victory over the mafia. A long story of violence marks the years of Sicilian command. "He who gets involved in the fight against the mafia puts his life on the line" As prefect Dalla Chiesa has said at the Chamber of Commerce of Palermo. This double murder is part of something much larger. The real question that should be asked in Sicily, like in all other countries, how to get only one power, a state with its institutions and laws. We can't share power with the provocateurs, the violent, or the dishonest. Good day, dottore. The President is waiting in the meeting room. - Finally, did you have a nice trip? - Let's say yes. - It's bad out there in Palermo. - Why? Please connect me with the office in New York. - Didn't you hear the Dalla Chiesa? - Don't worry. Take it seriously. The day the prefect will bother us, we will do what we have to do. Yes. Continue the operation with the South American banks. The authorization? The president is here right next to me. I'll pass the phone to him right now. Hello. Yes, agreed. You can proceed. If you please allow me, I want to talk about my two requests. - You would like to talk here? - Look, they are very simple. The first request is that my prefecture will coordinate the investigations, - on the mafia in all of Italy. - Most certainly. My second request is to discuss, the new anti-mafia law in parliament immediately, endorsed by Pio La Torre. You must understand that I am only a minister. - Things must be addressed gradually. - Yes, but with urgency, minister. But you know that the government is already sensitive on this subject. - We will do what's possible. Good luck! - Goodbye and have a safe flight. When are we done? Ah, here. Come in! - Take a seat, please. - Thank you. I have developed a plan containing four main points. That's how each of you can take on a specific problem. - That's good. - Start with you, dottore Torrisi. You must ask for a complete copy of all files on the following subjects: Scaglione, De Mauro, Russo, Reina, Francese, Terranova, Mancuso, Giuliano, Mattarella, Basile, Costa and Impastato. - Here it is. - That's great, excellence. I want a report on all investigations in Palermo, on drug trafficking made during the last 20 years. It needs to be on my desk within 48 hours. - All right. Now it is your turn, dottore Salemi, second point. - Yes. I need you to bring all documentation on all contributions paid by the State, the European Union, and by any Sicilian entrepreneur, real or ghost. - Is that clear? - Clear. Point three. You're up, dottor Lamantia. I want information from all banks, On all currency exchanges over one million Dollars and Swiss Francs, the corresponding identity while focusing on the last three years. - Here and abroad. - Consider it done, excellence. Finally you, dear Lo Verde. Point four. The Guardia Di Finanza has started to create an inventory on all contracts. This material needs to be available to my prefecture. - I need names and numbers. - Most certainly, excellence. - I made myself clear? - Yes. Well, I recommend. It's not that you... I want accurate data. If my help is needed, inform me and I take care of it. - Perfect. - If there's nothing else. One more thing, excellence. Journalists request an interview, a meeting. Tell them they can count on my friendship, not on my interviews. - I would like to thank you, good night. - Good night, excellence. - Ah, Lo Verde. - Yes? Have you requested the ballistics report on the murder of La Torre? Of course, excellence. I will have them tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. What do you mean by tomorrow or the day after? Call the specialist immediately. - Now? - Yes, now. - But right now, the offices are closed. - Then call them at home. Let's see, I got clear picture. When the assault on La Torre and Di Salvo happened, shots have been fired from at least two guns, a Thompson automatic rifle, and a .45 caliber handgun. But, shots have been fired from only one gun. Thus, without any doubt, the weapons have been modified. Yes, but to modify guns is sophisticated work, it's no joke. For whom? For those whom, let's say Garcia, have changed land value from 3 to 23 billion? They are true artists. These experts are rare. Great, that's what I want to hear. Let's do it! If there is an artist out there, we will find him. - Good night, gentlemen. - Thank you for your overtime. - Listen! - At your service! - Is that the window of captain Fontana? - I am here, general. There you go. Taste that frittata and tell me how you like it. You don't want to eat? No, I'm thinking about what you said and your programme. - And what do you think? Good or bad? - It depends. It depends on what political authority you have. You know, here... Here, what? You don't believe that I came here as a tourist, right! To be precise, and to put things in clear perspective what political power do you have? It starts with these powers, Fontana. We had them against the Red Brigades, and here we will have them against the mafia. General, this is different. The State had to defend itself against the Red Brigades, because it was terrorism against the State. Here, the mafia and power... But, porco diavolo, Fontana, why all the pessimism? From Palermo, general. I have never moved from there. Because of living in Palermo I'm more experienced. Despite everything that has been done it will always be like this. For example, Michele Sindona's endeavors in Sicily. - What did his investigation include? - Investigation? What investigation? There was no investigation. - How? - There was no investigation. We all know that there was no investigation. The rise of Sindona in Sicily, a grotesque attempt to make us believe he was kidnapped by the Red Brigades, while he met with all mafia bosses, assassins. Okay, okay. And then? Then, he was a judge. But you know that the results of the investigation are related to, collaborations, and a certain climate... Yes. General do you know what my father said? Bees produce three things. Honey, wax, and shit. That's how it is here in Palermo. There's honey, there's wax, and there's shit. - Sometimes the honey is locked-in. - I understand. The investigation into Sindona's rise won't happen in my prefecture, If you won't collaborate. General, I'm not sure you understand, but your ideas could lead to a real earthquake. Even better! In any case, as far as I am concerned, I must inform my superiors about what you have said to me. - You know, I am... - Fontana, Leave it, I know very well how to speak to a captain of the Carabinieri. I also know that I'm not wearing your uniform anymore. But I do wear the insignia on my skin. So for everything you need to ask. General, what can I do for you? Listen, I want a full investigation into all employees in your prefecture. I want to know everything: how, when and why they have been hired, Their standard of living, their relatives, even the ones that live far away. - Here is Terranova. - Scaglione. - I found the files on Reina! - And here is the dossier on De Mauro. I'm very curious, who is interested in all those dead people? 007? We kindly requested the data on foreign currency exchanges, Which are curated by your bank during the last three years. - He writes kindly. - Do I need to answer, direttore? Yes. Kindly respond to the prefect, That we have received the request and promptly started the process. - Promptly? - Promptly. Excuse me dottor Salemi. The regional tax documents are from which years? From today until 1971. This is the index which contains entrepreneurs. To the left the names, to the right the figures. Do you see? An accurate list with the most important entrepreneurs from Catania and Palermo. Lo Verde. Do you have a moment to share? Come, Lo Verde! Come! Tell me, excellence. - I wanted to show you a couple of photos. - You know him, don't you? - It's the banker Michele Sindona. He shot himself in a knee so people would believe he was kidnapped by Red Brigades. While in reality Sindona was residing quietly at his home in Palermo. Right before and after this incident four people were killed: Giuliano, Costa, Mattarella, and Terranova. Strange. Isn't it? And this? Yes, Miceli Crimi. The prefecture's clerk. Do you want to know who shot Sindona's knee, Lo Verde? Josef Miceli Crimi! Brother of this man who is now working in my prefecture. We need to find a solution to this bureaucratic problem Lo Verde. Yes, excellence. I will take care of it immediately. Crazy stuff, isn't it? - And you were accusing me of being pessimistic. - Do you hold a grudge? - Excuse me, general. How don't you get pessimistic? Sometimes I want to leave everything behind. Excuse me. Fontana, listen, if someone doesn't want to come, one doesn't come. And if he wants to leave, he always finds a way. Since I came here and found you. Come, let's get a coffee. - Hello. - We have received a strange phone call. Perfect, forward it to me. - Hello! Do I speak with the press? - Yes, newspaper Cronaca Dell'Ora. Here the Red Brigade. At the central station a bomb will explode against the new prefect. We don't want Dalla Chiesa understood? We do not want him. A press release will follow. Red Brigades? Who are you? Give me the mobile unit immediately, and then the prefecture. - Is there news? - There is no bomb here. Probably the work of a mythomaniac. Excellence, do you want to attend the service commemorating captain Basile? - Yes. - I can confirm that? On the contrary. Send a telegram and tell them that I won't attend. - I think I misheard you. - No, you understood it all very well. I never say what I'm about to do. Please remember that for future reference. Yes, I am ready prefect. I'm captain Ricciardi. - Tell me captain, any new developments? - Yes. Maybe so. How so maybe? Did you find the gun dealer or not? Not yet, but we know that he goes by the nickname Il Muto. Very well. Continue like that captain. I would like to know as soon as possible. Thank you. Goodbye. Listen Lo Verde. I would like to be wrong, But at the beginning and the end of our call I hear strange noises. - Try to call someone. - Who should I call? - Whoever you want. - My house, okay? Yes, perfect. Hello. Are you there? Yes, it's me. Excuse me, I have dialed the wrong number. I need to call somebody else. I need to work now. I leave you be. A kiss. Ciao! I also heard a strange noise. Something like a click. Muto! Step back. Please back up. Back, please. Is it okay there? Now even higher. Perfect, now move over to the capital. Check the picture frames thoroughly. Don't forget to check the lamps. Sorry, excellence. I can guarantee you that there are no microphones, Of any kind. Lo Verde, we need to test why there is interference on my phone line, No matter how complicated it is. It's better for everyone. - Do you understand? - Excellence! See you tomorrow! Carlo, it feels like life there. How can you be forced all the time to suspect everyone. Without even having a someone who, I don't know. All by yourself. Stay calm. I talk to you, I'm not alone, come on. Yes, you're alone, that's what scares me. - Listen to me, Emanuela. - No, you listen to me! I want to come to Palermo. When you want to talk to somebody, I want to be there, close to you, and not on the phone. I'm sorry. When we are on the phone I can't tell you everything. Why? - The phone turns everything into something gigantic! - And that's exactly the reason. - Wait a moment, Emanuela, wait. Listen, I can come to Rome at the end of the week. We can meet at my daughter's house? - Can you leave Milan? - Of course. How can you think that something can prevent me. Of course, I can come to see you. The objective of the assassins was the Catanese boss Alfio Ferlito, who was arrested in Milan for drugs, and detained at Enna, Sicily. This morning an escort of four people, accompanied Ferlito for a transfer to a prison located in Trapani. All were murdered by shots from a Kalashnikov: the boss, the driver, and three policemen. The massacre leads to various interpretations. It may be the last act of the feud between Ferlito and Santapaola, to control the heroin market and gun trade in the city of Catania, and may be beginning of a noisy settlement of accounts, between gangs from Trapani, Catania, and Palermo. Go away, please. How is it possible that nobody has a cover? - Bring a cover immediately! Please let me make this clear, I need to continue with the initial investigation. By the way Judge, I request that this investigation is assisted by captain Fontana. Keep in mind that I have responsibility over the investigation. These are the letters of the law. But there is also the human right not to die in that way! Captain, I will contact you when I am able to proceed the investigation. To continue to speak on procedural measures! We are fed up of being sent to the slaughterhouse like that! You aren't alone in your trips to the slaughterhouse. - Ciao Emanuela. - Ciao! - How are you? - You? Good. - And your trip? - Great! Your father hasn't arrived yet? No. He won't come anymore. Why, what happened? - He's ok, but there was an assassination in Palermo. Three policemen were killed. I'm going to Palermo. - Miss Setti Carraro? - Yes. - Good day. - Are you Fontana? - Yes. - Why? - The general is awaiting you. - Thank you. - You are really headstrong. - Why? I don't understand? Emanuela, you don't realize what is exactly happening here in Palermo. Yes, you're right. Excuse me. I'm so glad to see you, but... Today, when Rita told me what had happened here. - Wait, I need to get my bag. - No. Emanuela. - Tell me. - You didn't fully understand. - What's up? - You can't stay here. What? Listen, in an hour an aircraft departs for Rome. You need to take it. No, Carlo. Are you joking! Emanuela, I need you to make this sacrifice, Because I know that you will understand. You must understand, Emanuela. Let's go, Fontana, let's go. Flight 366, immediate boarding, gate 42. Attention, attention. Miss Setti Carraro arriving from Palermo is requested to go to the service desk. - Miss Setti Carraro? - Yes. It's for you. - Hello? - Would you like to go to the Dolimites? Carlo? Is it you? - In ten days, does that sound good to you? - What? - In ten days we will get married. Okay? PALERMO ALLIANCE AGAINST DRUGS That's how my son died. As one of those guys. And my son too. Nobody helped me to save him. If the city refuses to build a rehabilitation center for drug addicts, what help can a prefect offer us? We can't keep on talking and doing nothing. No. The death of a son should become a weapon against this monster, the mafia! We should force the state to battle, if it's necessary. The truth is, I need your help. You need to become my law enforcement. PALERMO GARIBALDI HIGH SCHOOL Prefect, I would like to ask you, why the fight against the mafia isn't just another an attempt at... Why do we need to oppose the mafia? Well, as with the fight against the Red Brigades, we must isolate the mafia from their allies. To become like a fish without water. This requires the confidence of us all. Prefect, it isn't that we don't have faith, but you come after so many others, who didn't help to fight the mafia. I have a lot of faith in the youth. I came here to give them something. I believe in values, because we are people, not numbers. What is more difficult: the fight against terrorism or the mafia? Against the mafia, no doubt. Especially the fact that outside of Sicily, The awareness on this issue is lacking. Hence, their reactions and thus their unwillingness to help. I would like to ask you something else. Given the results, do you think you arrest too many or too few people? Listen, I don't believe that it is a matter of quantity. It's about quality. Are you not afraid of what might happen to you? It's a fear I had already anticipated. But I try to keep it to myself and not to affect anyone else. The workers are a line of resistance against the mafia, just like the fight against the Red Brigades. I repeat, human dignity requires asserting one's own rights. Not the rights claimed by the mafia. For this we must have confidence in our institutions. But general, there is also the problem with job opportunities. Because when someone is born and raised without a job, the institutions. If you know what I mean. True, but it was you who wondered if there was no mafia behind unemployment? The mafia thrives where there is poverty, parasitism, and clientelism. Where there's a thriving industry, there's a great democratic maturity, And as a result the mafia is rejected. I want to thank you for this meeting. See you soon. Bye. General! What are you planning on doing in Palermo? A revolution? - No. - Then what? - To create a functioning government. - And this isn't a revolution? All right. That's enough, Rita. - I want a couple more, they are scarce. - You have more than enough. Ready! Smile! - Remove your glasses. - Oh, santo cielo, let's go. - This is Vincenzina. - Welcome, ma'am. God. This is a beautiful house. Carlo! Emanuela, excuse me. You know what my job entails. Do you have to go? What happened? Nothing serious. They need me at work. Ciao! The semi-final in Barcelona has started. Ciolek attacks, who replaced Boniek. Antonioni has recovered the ball. Tardelli, Orialli. Let's go. The assistant referee raised the flag. The referee didn't blow his whistle. Graziani's pass wasn't understood by Rossi. Matysik. Majewski. Kupcewic. Fullback Majewski is moving up the field. Now Lato, always on the left side. - Cabrini. - Go, go! There's a savage challenge on Cabrini. The referee lets the play continue! Always up front is Conti. This is a knock-out match: if it's tied after 90 minutes additional time will be added, Followed by a penalty shoot-out if it's tied after two hours of play. Rondine 12 for Z4: the villa is under control. Awaiting instructions. Over. Z4 for Rondine 12. Do you hear me? Continue monitoring the access routes. We will proceed with the raid. Over and out. Antonioni will take the free-kick. Goal! It was touched by Rossi! Touched by Rossi after a free-kick by Antonioni. Rossi's ball. - He just left. - Which way? That way. After 21 minutes of play Italy is in the lead. It's Rossi's fourth goal. It's a big mistake. You will regret this! Right now, Rossi catches up. Boniek. [SICILIAN INSULTS AND CURSES] I'm innocent. I'm an honest man. Rossi, goal! Two goals by Rossi. Great play by... Why don't you apprehend mafiosi and criminals? Instead you troubling the poor people. We are here to do our duty. Would you please open up your trunk? And? The most important boss escaped, but overall it was a successful raid. All right. Hopefully the Guardia Di Finanza has achieved similar results. Let's go. I'm Captain Berti of the Guardia Di Finanza. We are here for an investigation. - Hello. - Hello dottore. Something unbelievable is happening here. - What is happening? - They are putting seals on everything. They say it is a tax audit. What do you mean? That's impossible. Are they there? All right. Remain at your disposal. They have exceeded all limits. Leave me alone. I have to make a phone call right now. - Yes. Good evening, excellence. - Yes, do tell. I had expected these reactions. I don't speak to you with prudence and caution. Everything happened with full respect of the law, even within the very constricted laws. What do you say? Excuse me. Yes, you are right. It's my obsession. In fact, I will come to Rome to attain more effective weapons. Otherwise, everything will be rendered useless here. Very well. All right. Thank you for calling. Good evening, excellence. This time it is very dangerous. We will have to fight against all of Italy. Calm down. We'll talk about it. We can no longer continue like this. If it continues like this, we have to stop everything. Stay quiet. Reactions will be strong, but we are stronger. Good day, gentlemen. Palermo. Mafia gangs have unleashed an unprecedented series of attacks. Most likely a break between winning clans who have started a war, to control the heroin trade. All the fortunes of Santa Rosalia! Long live Santa Rosalia! All the fortunes of Santa Rosalia! Long live Santa Rosalia! Please, excellence, come in. - How are you doing, prefect? - Doing well. Thank you. - I am glad to see you here. - Thank you. I appreciate what you are doing. You have given the Palermitans hope. I will pray for you, but I won't limit my prayers. I hope that even in my parish, There are people who have the courage to tell the truth just like you. Following the statement of our archbishop, and the same words from our Holy Father, which tell you that we Christians can't be indifferent towards this voracious carnage. The mafia, which covers our streets with blood, an enemy devoid of any faith, of any hope, and any mercy. Who brings death, has no right to be called Christian. As Christians we demand transparency of our public administration. As Christians we won't assist in scandals, of mayors and municipal administrators, who flock to the funerals of well-known mafiosi. Hello, police station of Casteldaccia. Have fun looking at the red Fiat 127 in front of your police station. Hello! Officer! Officer! - There is a dead body. - The hands are tied together. And here too, their hands and feet are bound together with a single rope behind the neck. - Please stop with those flashes! - Get off! Basta! It's the prefect's car. Here with the cameras! - Excellence, just one word. - I have nothing to say! You don't want to answer any questions? - What for? To respond to the provocations. There are many different challenges. I am here to accept mine. It is the duty of us all. Yours too. Please. - Who is it? - Cesare Manzella, prefect. Hello. Editorial board of dell'Ora. This is a special communiqu?, write down. Operation Carlo Alberto in honor of the prefect. With today's murders it's almost over. I want to emphasize: almost over. Which operation? Hello? Pietro, did you record this? Okay. Perfect. Rome, August 1982. Dalla Chiesa, please come in. What about this unexpected visit? What happened that could be so serious? I will explain it all immediately, minister. The text of the anonymous phone call will appear newspapers in Palermo tomorrow. Read it with care! Just as the people will do. Replace the word prefect. "Operation Carlo Alberto in honor of the Italian state". What does that mean? - Do you have specific ideas? - No, mind you, minister. I am not a politician. Politicians have a duty to come up with ideas, proposals and laws. For me the law is an indispensable instrument I work with. You haven't given me the new anti-mafia law yet. Is it your intention to ask for a parliamentary debate? No, absolutely not. I am asking you for it all, and when I say everything, I mean laws that are useful and not only for police forces, but also for all governmental institutions. - Don't be so aggressive. Aggressiveness leads to indiscretions, and those indiscretions will end up in the newspapers. No, listen. Nobody has ever received an aggressive quote! I didn't say that! Well, prefect, If you had the intention, to give a warning, you have succeeded. I assure you that I will try to communicate the emergency to the parliament. I hope so. Or rather, I am sure of that, minister. Can I give you some good news? Within days, the government will present, a proposal to amend tax collection legislation. I'm not saying that is a revolution, but, a good thing, of course. If it gets approved. The law will be approved, otherwise I wouldn't have told you. It is the government which wants to present it. Today, parliament prepares to revert a privilege that's in place for 20 years, and enriched a small group of Sicilian families. The monopoly on levying taxes, is among the highest in Italy, with an interest rate of about 10%. - How's the voting process coming along? - It's about to end. Actually, it has just ended. It's a shame. It's indecent. You can't deal with these systems. It is truly indecent. - Ciao! What has happened? - The law didn't pass. There were 20 turncoats. An unforeseen twist within Sicilian parliament, and a huge blow for anti-mafia forces. The Barons of 10%, as labeled by the anti-mafia, have shown once again that they can influence the political balance, and even parliamentary elections. Hello, give me stenographer. Are you ready? Write down. In Sicily tax collection will continue to benefit, a small group of wealthy Sicilian families. In 1981, 50 billion. Changes to this, so called, feudal law aren't tolerated. - You seem quite satisfied. - Yes, thank you. - Dear senator! - Hello. - How are you? - Are you all happy? It is an offense to parliamentary democracy. - It's a shame! - How did you get here? - How was it? Have you been waiting for a long time? Answer me! How was it? Emanuela, if we don't believe in certain things, I wouldn't have been here, neither would you. Two more murders this afternoon in Palermo. In the Via Colonna Rotta, close to the Sicilian parliament, two heroin dealers have been murdered, who were part of a losing mafia gang. The mafia war is far from over. In less than a month in Palermo, 23 homicides were committed, and nobody has been apprehended. A special squad of the Carabinieri has nothing to show for, except the various murders. Research on these murders didn't lead to results. Since the start of the year, the murder rate in Palermo has reached 91, and about a hundred persons are missing. Silent deaths also called white lupara, in which the victim's body is deliberately hidden by the mafia. - Excuse me, ma'am. Did I scare you? - Don't worry. I brought these biscotti. I've made them myself. Please try them. They are very tasty. That's true, they are very good. Thank you. You always stay quietly at home. That's of no good use. All the time you're thinking. You should go out and distract yourself from time to time. Buy a newspaper. L'Ora! Miss, look at how many they have murdered! Emanuela, what's wrong? Tell me! Those dots, those dots, At least put them in front and not after the numbers! As if the murders will go on. It is fatal, but still... What does life mean for a man here? To create a fancy headline? Just a bet? Emanuela, calm down. - Carlo. - What's wrong? I'm afraid. No. - I don't believe that, Emanuela. - You know why I'm afraid? - Because we understand the truth. - But what truth, excuse me? I have been put here to divert attention, Carlo. They took you, your past, to create an alibi for us all. Because if you can't do anything against the mafia, it means that no one can. Do you understand? That's how you can create... - Emanuela. An alibi. We all will be justified... Stop, Emanuela. - How can I stop? - Head up! Don't you understand that they have put you in a horrible game, a game that can destroy you. That's the truth. Emanuela. If that is the truth. I'm not willing to endure, or to accept it. Soon, you'll understand why. Are you done? Is it over? - Good day. I'm Giorgio Bocca. - Thank you, come along! Bocca, the journalist, has arrived. - How are you, my dear Bocca? - As you see, I came immediately. Thank you. Come! General, are you here for love or because of your talents? Who are you really? A proconsul or a prefect in trouble? I'm certain I'm the first general of the Carabinieri in Italy's history, who has clearly mentioned to the government, that a prefecture doesn't interest me, even if it's first class. I'm interested in the fight against mafia, as well as the means and power that is needed to win, but only in the interest of the State. I think I do understand the new rule of the game. Mafia kills the one in power when a fatal combination occurs. When the man in power is deemed too dangerous, he can be killed, because he is isolated. Dear Bocca, he who thinks that the fight against the mafia, only takes place in Palermo, and not in the rest of Italy, would do nothing but waste his time. I don't ask for special laws. I ask for transparency. In the sensational interview with Giorgio Bocca, The prefect Dalla Chiesa mentioned the existence of new mafia territory. "These days the mafia is strong even in Catania" said prefect Dalla Chiesa. Major Catanese construction companies are active in Palermo these days. Hello. Yes. One moment, please. Yes? Yes, I'm listening to the interview on the radio. I believe that we can no longer wait. Yes, yes. The aforementioned conditions will cease to exist. I agree. Yes, I will call him. Bye for now. Call Milan immediately. - Now? - Now. If prefect feels lonely, we will keep him company. With that interview you made a great impression. It seems that the mafia is enraged. Fontana, I'm not interested in negative responses. I just want positive answers, from the government. In a hundred days since I'm here, absolutely nothing has happened! You can't say that, general. The government fell over the tax-collection scandal. They have appointed somebody else who is exactly the same. Who is on a vacation! So far, Fontana, we were kind to those mafia puppets. But now the music has changed. Now, we have to get them out of their sanctuaries. I'm talking about the highest level, Even if we risk everything. Do you understand? What tools can we use, general? In the current situation, we need full commitment. What the hell are you saying, Fontana? According to you we can't do anything here? While at the same time I see dead people everywhere. Must I remain nailed to my sofa? Fontana, read this! These people have dominated Sicily for the last 30 years. If I tell you to arrest them, what do you say? That sufficient evidence is needed, general. Don't bother about the evidence. Who do you meet, who do you want! I'm asking you. What do you say? That you need evidence. I understand. Which means that I have to do without you too, Fontana. General, nobody can do this alone. I believe they are all fucking with us here. This doubt, Fontana... Everyone has to manage that by himself as far as I'm concerned. Remember one thing: against the Red Brigades we went to the bitter end. Against the mafia we'll do the same. Carlo! Listen, do we really have to go to this party? If it is for me. We can't always say no. Please prepare yourself for... - For what? - You will see. Let's go. - Will Dalla Chiesa come? - He told the mayor that he would. Then he doesn't come. But a beautiful wife can't be kept at home. True. Excellence, they have arrived! - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. Ma'am, I want to express my deepest gratitude, Because we are honored with your presence. Thank you. The prefect Mori has said to Il Duce, that the Sicilian mafia makes up 3% of the population. Even today we see that the mafia has expanded more than expected. In 1977, Palermo had five murders per hundred thousand inhabitants, and at the end of 1981 the number has increased to 8. If we look carefully, the murder rate in Naples is higher. Apart from the terrible heat, how do you like Palermo, ma'am? - I love it. Against the Red Brigades everything was coming your way, but against the mafia! Baron, you should say this in a high school in Palermo, and see how they will respond. Why do you care so much about the youth, excellence? - The youth is unspoiled. - And those who are using drugs? Without a doubt cleaner than the people upon whose shoulders they stand, Baron. You should ask your husband. - Yes, certainly. - Carlo. Excuse me. - Please allow me! - Go ahead. What's up? An engineer and his wife have invited me to their home for tomorrow afternoon. Excellence, it's only a party in our swimming pool. They are only a couple of close friends. Thank you, Mr. Engineer. My wife does only what I say. And I say no! Carlo, shall we go? Yes, let's go. Hey mama? Ciao. How are you? Good? Nothing. I wanted to say hi quickly. I'll take Carlo to the prefecture and then have dinner. Tonight, I had gelato? We hope you will like it. You don't know? I enjoyed it a lot! No. I'm happy tonight. I don't know, I just am. I don't know. I'm happy and that's it. I just wanted to tell you. Really, nothing special happened. In fact, everything goes wrong here, but I'm happy. I feel happy with Carlo. Maybe tomorrow will be different, and the problems begin. Oh, I have to run. They are waiting for me. Maybe I can call you in a bit when I'm at the prefecture. No, I don't want Carlo to know. He gets upset if I phone people there, Something Piedmontese. Yes, perfect. I promise. I'll call you later. Ciao! Listen, excellence. We already have sent two copies. One to the ministry and the other one to the regional parliament. All right. I want a precise list. Come in! - Good evening. - Emanuela! - You are right on time! - I know you like it. - Well. we're done for today. - Yes, excellence. - You know what we can do? - Tell me! Go to Mondello and eat fish. How do you mean? Vincenzina already prepared dinner. Which means she can have the night off. Do you want to go? - Of course! Lo Verde, please do me a favor. Reserve me a table, the usual spot. I will do so immediately, excellence. - Shall we go? - Let's go! - Good night, excellence. - Good night, miss. Good night, Lo Verde. - Let's do tomorrow morning at eight. - Perfect, excellence. Carlo. I'd like to propose to take Rita?s little girl for a few days. What do you say? That's good. - She could come to the beach with me. - Yeah, yeah, I will call her tomorrow. - Are we going to Mondello? - No, we are going home. All right. Emanuela! They slaughtered them! Scoundrels! Amore, amore, let's go! ["U CUNTU" BY MIMMO CUTICCHIO] "They had all their windows open to rest after a hard day, some were seated at a table, ready to eat or to drink, some were watching television. They all looked out for the shots. Then, when they saw what had happened they locked themselves in the house. People hear the sirens, The police cars arrive, a crowd of people gathered who wondered: "What has happened?", But when they understood it, they all escaped, and only the policemen remained. When you see the bodies with bullet holes, it is covered with a sheet, that turns red with blood. All go to bed, terrified. Then at dawn when the walls in Palermo also started to wake up, the wall in front of which the General had been killed. On it a Palermitan writes: Here all hope dies for the honest Palermitans. Lord, tell you, it's isn't true, hope doesn't die for the honest Palermitans! Sicily isn't engulfed by the mafia! We are not the mafia! We must all fight together to defeat the mafia, And someday you can shout into the four winds. I am Sicilian! I am Sicilian! I am Sicilian! I am Sicilian!" Subtitle by: U Vincuuuuuuu! July 28, 2019.
