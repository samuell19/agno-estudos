So, I'm single. You meet me later. Hey. Yeah. You look like you've got some sexy emotional baggage. I am thinking of starting a dating app. It's for girls like me that matches you up with guys that have no interest in dating you, okay? You just matched with Brian. He is hot, unemployed and still in love with his ex. It's going to be called Daddy Issues, a destructive way to continue the search for love you never got as a child. Guys use me for my body and I use them to... This isn't normally what happens when a girl I meet in a club invites me back to her place. The whole thing about single is that I'm so attracted to basically... - I'm sorry. - No, I mean you're funny. - Oh, thanks. Do you really think so? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. But you're also really pretty and that is, um, very distracting. Um, before we proceed, can we just watch the next part of the video? I just really needed to laugh so I can feel validated. Where is she? She was supposed to get here last night. She had a show last night. I'm sure she'll show up. Phone, phone, it's my phone. Am I gonna get it? There's like fifty missed texts. Fine. Can you just get dressed please? Yeah, yeah. Cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um... What's happening? Could you stand right here? And then, if you just like... yeah, pretend you're my boyfriend, okay? Uh, why? It's... it's Henri. Hi, everyone. I'm here now. It's me, Henri. - Hi, Henri. - Carry on. How can you not be with your family at your father's funeral? As if Dad would have cared anyway. I am making a statement. This is Kevin, everyone. It's Charlie. This is Charlie, everyone. Ms. Henrietta, it's always, um, lovely to meet you. Sorry about... I was going. I'm gonna leave. - Hang up on her. - Wait. I have something to say. If I had attended today, I was going to talk about how Dad and I used to go to the park when I was at school in California. We never had much to say to each other when we were there, but it really meant a lot to me to be there. And I'm sorry, Dad, I know you're done with all my career choices. All I ever wanted was your acceptance. Hello. Hello. Hello. She didn't call. Oh, she called. Oh. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Henrietta. So big of her. So big of her. Yeah, but she lives, you know... What? What? What? She was here in some way. Party tonight at Fabric. I know you wouldn't miss it. 11:00 PM. Alright, babe, here is Paul. Sorry I missed you last night. I'll stop by tomorrow. I was so sorry to hear of your father's passing, Henrietta. How are you handling it? Well, to be honest, I've been sitting in my room alone and... Well, the reason we're here. Your father has left you his Los Angeles estate. I mean, I haven't been back in like five years so. There are some papers here and some personal items. "Dear Henrietta, I am dead. My house in California is yours to live in. You must successfully see to my company's legacy. If you failed at doing so with the Norton Phillips Company, my whole life will have been meaningless. This is what you were born to do. Hopefully by the time you are reading this, that comedy hobby of yours will be a thing of the past and you will see it for what it should have been all along, a hobby. I want you to know there are ways to improve on who you are. You want to improve, right?" What is up, LA? How are we all doing? We are so excited to see all the fresh talent in the house tonight. I hope we're all having a great time and everybody is loving Best Comic US . Now let's all give a big warm welcome to our next comic. Hello, everyone. My name's Henrietta, or Henri, for when my father reminds me he wanted a boy. I'm here because I can't afford therapy right now. Is anyone else here because of that? Yes, sir. And are you here because you have a family that you can't get away from? Well, I thought moving five thousand miles would get me away from mine. I never had a stable home. I grew up between London and LA. I seriously have nowhere left to hide. Oh my God. My parents always told me the reason they chose practical careers and worked so hard their entire life was so that I could follow my dreams. Then they very happily told me that my dream was to work their business. That's kind of like the waiter at the restaurant telling you "You can order anything as long as it's the pancake." Guys that have no interest in dating you. It's gonna be like you just matched with Brian. He is hot, unemployed, and still in love with his ex. A destructive way to search for the love you never got at home. It's so good to see you guys. - I know. - It really is. This is the best. It feels like college. Oh, Henri, you're like a serial killer who kept all of her victims' phone numbers. Wait, wait, wait, oh my gosh, listen to this. "Dear Henri, you looked so cute wearing my hat you stole. By the way, when can I get my hat back? Hunter Ellis." Yeah. Hunter Ellis. - You loved him. - Yeah, you certainly... Guys, like, we hooked up a couple of times. It's no big deal. If I ever married Hunter Ellis, what would be better? Like, if I... if I was like, "Oh, I threw your hat away," or "Here it is. I kept it after all these years." - And threw it away. - Yeah, definitely. You throw away the hat. Hey, what were you getting up to in London? Loads of stuff like, you know, replying to emails, cleaning out my spam folder, like, yeah, spam folders takes ages. Wait, wait, hang on. What about stand-up? You were doing stand-up. Yeah, didn't... you won that huge competition right before you left. That was a super... Big deal. Are you still doing it? Yeah, no, it wasn't such a big deal, you know, it's like... it was... I mean I've definitely done stand-up since then and I mean, it was like... it was something... hey, I wonder... wait, does pot get better with age? I'm just gonna go check my... my stash 'cause I think it's like somewhere in one of those... those souvenirs. Does pot get better with age? She's definitely not doing stand-up, right? - No. - I do actually hope she has pot. Nolan! - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? I live here. Nolan is here? The one I went to college with. Perfect. Hi, guys. Hello. What are you doing here? Because this is... Was my Dad's house. Yeah, I know. I've been renting a room from him and redoing... redoing the deck out front. For how long? Not long. Not long. Four... four, five... four, five years. Nolan, why don't you come join us. There's obviously so much we have to catch up on. - Yeah, come on. - Probably not that much. Okay, yeah. I mean, unless you guys just invited me 'cause you feel obligated, like, I don't... I don't need to party, I can just like hang in my room on my computer. So I should... It'll only take me like a couple of seconds to get dressed... - No. No, no, you're fine. - And I can just get... Alright. Weird. - Yeah. Hit me. - Kind of... Well, I hate to be that person, but I have a 5:00 AM yogalates class in the morning, so. - No. - Yeah, I can't believe I'm up this late, I have a deposition. Why? Seriously, stay longer. No, no, they're right. This is like the longest I've ever left Glen alone with the baby and I'm afraid he's gonna like microwave the formula or something. Hey, that's like a good thing though, right? He's... No, sweetie, no. It's not okay. Nolan, kisses and hugs. Nolan, it's been real. Love you. - See you later guys. - Love you. - So much more wine, love. - Yeah. You guys adults yet? No. And this is the closet. Oh really? I thought it was the pool. So weird. Dad's clothes. They smell just like him. Those are mine actually. This is bigger than my entire apartment. Alice, how's the high-powered Hollywood talent agent lifestyle treating you? Oh, it's good. It's good. - What do you do? - She was a TAA. - Oh, cool. - She's an aspiring agent. She's absolutely awesome at it. And she knows everybody in town. - I don't know everybody. - Oh my God, you could hook me up with a gig, right Alice? Oh, I... I didn't even... I didn't even know you still want to do that. Yeah, of course, I do. Oh. But why'd you leave right after you won the competition? I didn't win, I got third place. - Oh. - But I'm gonna start back where I left off. But you know it's not that easy, right? You have to like, you know, get your tapes with new sets and... I was gonna do that anyway. Sorry. Hello. I'll take this. One second. Hey, was that little weird to you? What do you mean? I just think she's a bit weird about showing people my stuff. You know, I'm sure it's just like complicated to show your friend to people in the industry. - Hmm. - Yeah. You should wear clothes now. Hey. Hey, where are you? I have a vegan lasagna with your name on it. Literally. I spelled your name out in spaghetti sauce, it is illegible but still edible. Is it fun to see your old college friends? It's like is anybody really weird or fat now? I don't know. Okay, never mind. So, you wanna come over? Uh, actually I think I'm just gonna stay on the couch here, I've had some wine. Yeah, roger that. I will just freeze that lasagna for another time. Have fun. Thanks, babe. Love you. Love you, too. And lower. - Five. - Pressing the heels together. - Is that Ava? - Yeah. Cool. Everything okay? Yeah, everything is great. It is good. Awesome. But I do have to go. - Oh, no. - I know. I'm so happy you're back. Yeah. So good to see you. Do you ever feel like there's something wrong with you? What do you mean? There's something about me. If you found out, I'm afraid you wouldn't love me anymore. Russ, there is nothing that you can ever tell me about yourself... Who's that? That's my girlfriend. - See that? - Ah. She's a little young for you. No, that's a... that's... the consenting adult is my girlfriend. - Oh. - That's her daughter. - Oh, cool. - Yeah. - Cute. - Thank you. So, you're like a dad kind of? No, no, no dad, just dating a mom. - Cool. - Yeah. There's something. Well, you've always had the wardrobe for it. ...that I just can't leave behind. Oh, well bushed. I'm gonna go to sleep. Are you going to bed? Um, no, jet lag anyway, so. - Okay. Well, it's good... it's good seeing you. There you go. - Good to see you again. - Alright. Good night. - Night. I focus on the future. I have to go. Now? It's the middle of the school day. I said I have to go. Don't you get it? Hey. Yeah, I was wondering if you still wanted your hat back. You look like that movie star Claudette Colbert. Thanks. I don't... I don't know who that is. Sorry. She's Clark Gable's girlfriend. - Oh. - Yeah. I know Clark Gable. Good. - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I... I... I can't do this and... - Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm, uh, I don't know what I am doing here and... - I'd like to get to know you. - I'm not a prostitute. - I'm not a prostitute. - I never said you're a prostitute. That's why I went to that site. I thought this was like thinly veiled prostitution. Oh, so you're a prostitute? No, I'm not a... Oh my God, oh my God, yeah, yeah. I can see how that looks like, I... I'm not. I'm just... It was a stupid idea, I know, to go on the Internet looking for companionship. But I'm sorry... I've never done this before. - Oh really? - No way. - So, you don't know what's going on either? - No. But, you know, I'm looking for some companionship. I... I have... I was married for a long time. - Yeah? - And I have a lot of stress in my job and I just don't know how to go about meeting someone anymore. I have something to give, I think. - Sure. - I like to share it with... with someone who... Was beautiful and intellectual, you know, someone like you. Thank you. How do you feel, LA Sugar 26? Oh my God. Well, embarrassed, first of all. How about some wine? Room service, good conversation. Can we order mashed potatoes? - Yeah. - Okay. It's great to see you. You look good. Thanks. Let me do that. - I've got it. - Oh, it's okay. It just bugs me when people pour beer the wrong way. You have to do it perfectly, that way you get one inch of foam. I really like foam. That's not how beer is supposed to be. It's how my beer is supposed to be. It's not though. I'm sorry. I didn't realize I've been doing that wrong. It's okay. That's what I'm here for. Wow. It's so clean in here. We're not trying to mess up or anything. - No, of course. - You know. So... Yeah. I like your place a lot. I like you in my place. - Uh-huh. - It is great to see you. It's so good to see you, too. One second. It'll wrinkle. If next time you could just like throw it on the chair. Where were we? If you could just take your shoes off really quick? - Take my shoes off? - Yeah. - Oh, you like my shoes off? - I do. - You prefer them off? - Yes. - How is that? - So much better. - Is it really? - Oh my God, it's something really. - Get to that toaster. - Can I just... - Yeah. - Thanks. Thanks for driving. So how did you just forget to drive on which side of the road? And how does that just like leave your mind? I mean, I'm just a bit nervous. It's been a while and I can't be late for the board. You gotta say your speech? No. I mean I've been a board member of the Norton Phillips Company for four years now, so. Mm. Yeah, but like how many times have you actually had to do anything? I'm looking forward to this. Why? Because I work there. Oh my God. I'm your boss now? No, you're not. And my first thought's gonna be to fire you. - What? - Yeah. Yeah, one more word... shh, one more word and you're fired. - You're... You're fired. - You're fired. You're fired. - You're... you're fired. - You're fired. Shh. Don't say it. Shh. Stepping in for her late father and our CEO who we miss greatly here in LA with a degree in marketing... Alumni of LMU here in LA, Henrietta Norton Phillips. Um, is this thing on? Hello, hello. Hi. Hello, everybody. You, casual Friday, where are you here from? I'm Spencer from Human Resources. Since when were humans, just a resource, right? I mean, what are we, oil? This has been a tough year for Norton Phillips, guys. You need to know that you can be better than what you are now. I mean, we all miss my father, right? All I can do is claim my own fresh start. And that is exactly what we're gonna do here at Norton Phillips, at the New Year. We are gonna start afresh. Here's to Norton Phillips! Bring in the champagne. Who wants some? Yes. Henrietta, you coming in here was just a formality. Yeah, but according to my father's will, I'm executive vice president member of the board, so. My daughter is vice president of her seventh-grade class. Some titles just don't require real responsibility. That's lunch, everyone. As a former seventh-grade class vice president, I'm offended by that. To Mr. Norton Phillips. - To Ed. - To Dad. Oh my God, how did it get so late? Champagne can do that. Oh God. Oh my God, Terrance, what's wrong? That was supposed to be uplifting. No, no, no, it's not you. It was uplifting, it was really nice. It's just... I'm an alcoholic and I've been sober for six weeks today. - Oh God, no. - Yeah. - No. - It's not... it's fine, it's fine. - No. - Listen, I'm just grieving, I miss your dad so much. He was so nice and caring. And he's the only one who donated to my Kickstarter. And I shared it. Did you donate? I make these little wooden animal figurines and, you know, nobody really likes them but... - What? - He really did. Oh my God, what? Why did he support your weird hobby and not mine? Why? I'm sure he supported you in his own way. I'm sure he loved you. You're very funny, yeah. Yeah. This is stupid anyway. Nobody bought any of them. - Oh my God... - Will you buy some? I'm gonna buy a ton. I'm gonna buy a ton. You're gonna buy a ton? Oh my God. It turns out we're good. Do you guys wanna come over and have dinner? - Right now? - Yeah, right now. - No, I think... - I don't think that's like... he'll probably get you there. - Hey, it's for him. - You're my best friend. - This is him. This is our guy. - Here it is. You know this guy? I'll take you home. You guys coming with me? Not tonight. Maybe another night. Hang out another night, yeah. - Maybe another night. - Thanks for the fun times. Yeah. Bye, Terrance. Feel better. Get some sleep. Get some carving done, man. Get that carving in. Who are you? Wanna do some more? I have to get back. - Oh, really? - I'm sorry. Yeah, I do. Really? There's pubs to the left and to the right down the street, there's a terrible live music bar. - It's so fun though. Come on. - Oh, does that sound great? That sounds so good. Hey, I'll leave and give you that because there's a little bit left. I know. I have to go though. You want to come? No, you're so boring, man. - Okay. Well... - You're a duh. On that note, are you coming? Train's leaving. Train's leaving. I hate the carriage on the train. See ya. Alright. Hey, it's Alice. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Hi, this is Hunter Ellis. Hey, Hunter, it's Henri here. I am out with friends right now. - But I might be... - Man, I tell you, you owe us two tabs and shit. Might be available later if you want to get together. - Shh! - When the midnight comes, you bitches be crowned with the fire brimstone with your tooth. - Then just give me a call, okay? - Bitches. Daddy issues. What did you say? You can't have my roof. No way. That dickhead! - See you tonight. - See you tonight. - Hey girl. - Oh God, I didn't mean to call a ride share. Are you the Henrietta? - Yeah. - Hi. - Follow the Beamer! - Oh my God! Where do you keep coming from? Um, excuse me. Wait, we gotta follow the Beamer. No, no, no, because we got to get to Islands because Lindsay is going to marry tomorrow. Whoo! We got the married dance. We... so are you guys criminals? No, no, no, it's about my boyfriend. He's in that. - It's your boyfriend? - Not boyfriend. - He's such a hipster. - I like you. Yeah. We met searching for pirate treasure on St. Edward Island. - No, no. - That's so romantic. None of that is real, guys. - Listen, Pam. - It's Pam. - Pam. - Pam. We need to follow that Beamer because the man that is my soul mate is in there with another woman. Oh no. Do you... do you guys think Aiden will do that to me after we get married tomorrow? - No. - No. Why would he? You're so pretty. - And your bangs are amazing. - Why would he touch your... Okay, okay, can we just drive? I always wanted to be in a high speed of car chase, you know. But seriously though, the secret to a healthy relationship, Stephanie, I'm talking to you, is by compassionate boundaries, and that's how Heidi and I, we keep things so put together. I haven't been doing any of those things, where I've been going wrong? - Okay, calm... Did we lose him? - You guys are beautiful. They are in his apartment. What a dick. Asshole. Do you think Aiden will bring a girl back to his apartment - after we get married tomorrow? - Maybe. - He may, I don't know. - I don't know, Lindsay. They're leaving... they're leaving the house. - Oh my God. - She's an overnight bag. Matilda has a boss. Shh! No, no, no, that means that he was in the apartment earlier today with her. I like the lawn ornaments. - Cover up. - You can have it. Rip it! - Rip it! - Break it apart. How long were you with this asshole anyway? Like two days, but it's not really, you know, like labeled or anything like that. Wait, what? Oh my God. Two days? - I got to get to Islands. - I feel sad now. He still hurt me. I'm still wounded. - You finally got in. - Yeah. It's really nice. Yeah, it's fine. I mean, I personally want to redo it again but it's a... it's a Hollywood landmark. - Really? - Yeah. Tammy Wynette's manager died right in there. - What? - You ever been to Asia? No, I've actually never left the US before. But I've seen Niagara Falls from a distance, which is sort of like going to Canada. Really? You should go to Canada. People are... they're nice, they're beautiful. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know what? - What? - Plan a trip. To Canada? I'd love to plan a trip to Canada. No. Plan a trip and I'll take care of the expenses. - What? - Yeah. Get out of here. Richard. The people in Canada are beautiful. That's, yeah, I mean, Richard, you might be the most positive person I've ever met. Oh, yeah. That's 'cause I work out a lot. Oh, nice. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. - You want some? - Oh, no, no. - Sure? - I'm good. Yeah. - But here, watch me do a handstand. - Yeah. Okay, that was a terrible handstand. Richard. Richard. Richard. Jesus. Yeah, yeah, he's breathing, he's breathing. And what is your address? Um, I don't know the address but it's the corner of Doheny and Wilshire. Okay. And who is he? His name's Richard. Richard who? Richard... Richard... I don't know what his last name is. It's a Richard some... so please hurry. We are sending someone now. Okay, thanks. They tell me you're gonna be fine. Thank you for this. Thanks. No way. Thank you, sugar daddy. I just don't get why you... you won't let me meet her. Like, kids love me. I'm glad that you wanna meet her. Well, then let me meet her. Just not quite yet. She's four, and I don't want to introduce her to a guy unless it's serious. Are we not serious? You tell me. Nolan! - I crashed a bachelorette party! Boom! - Whoo! Hey. Hi. Hi. You must be Henrietta. Yes, I must be, mustn't I? Nice to meet you. I'm Grace. Oh. Yes. Is she okay? Yeah, yeah, she's... she's great. She is going to let you two date each other into the night. Bon voyage. What's wrong with her? Something weird? I didn't notice anything. "If you failed at doing so with the Norton Phillips Company, my whole life will have been meaningless. This is what you were born to do. And this is why I'm..." Assume you're good to drive home? Yeah, for sure. Unless you want to come with and drive me. I mean, what, you had like two glasses of wine, right? You should be good. No, I mean, unless you want to drive me and come over to my place. Violet is at my mom's. Oh, um. Yeah. I don't... Maybe not tonight. Can... can we rain check? - Okay. - I'm sorry, I know this is... No, it's... it's cool. Goodnight. Grace, I'm sorry. I'm... I'm... I'm being a huge idiot right now, I'm sorry. Of course, I want to come over. No, you rain-checked, it's fine. But... I'll see you later. - Hey. - Hey. I like the addition to the ping-pong table. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah, alright. - It's about you. Yeah. You know, I'm kind of a jock. I'm really good at ping-pong. Boom. Can't sleep. Yeah, me neither. Grace is mad at me. Well, I destroyed a bunch of pink balloon flamingoes. What? Why? Seemed like a good idea at the time. Okay, alright. Wanna play with your balls? Alright. Loser serves. Hey. That's you, right? - No, you've the ball, just serve it. - Okay. Okay. Loser. Alright. That was so in. - What? - It was your fault. Do you even want to... there you go. That's what happens when you just don't know how to play. Oh my God, stop attacking me. I'm not attacking you, I'm trying to show you how to... oh, hit your face! I'm sorry, I should stop. - I should just stop. - You're not playing, are you? What... what are you doing? It's so aggressive! Wow. Do you know what to do if there's an earthquake? Oh, yeah, I have a kit. What's in your kit? It's got a bottle of water, some rope, a Taser gun, a pair of socks. That's it? - Yeah. - You're screwed. You're so screwed. What? You're stuck in a serial. At least I have a kit. Yep, touché. So why are you here at 2:00 AM? 'Cause I wanted to drink beer with my best friend on the roof and 'cause you're a pack. Oh, yeah, I'm glad you did. Yeah. Don't leave again. Okay. I missed you. - I always miss you. - Yeah. It's nice to be here. How's Ava? Ava is good. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm... I'm a little bored. Really? We've been together for, you know, a while now and, I don't know, I think I just... maybe it's not her. I just need something new to happen, a change or something. Hmm. Yeah. Try killing your dad. Mine's death really shook things up for me. - Henri. - Is that... is that really dark? Oh, it's certainly dark, isn't it? Well, if it makes you feel any better, my dad don't... like he doesn't even talk to me, so it's probably not that different. Yeah, I guess. But at least you can still talk to yours. I can't exactly call mine up on the phone. You should. Yeah. It's Henrietta Norton Phillips here. Yeah, I used to perform at your club quite a lot. I'm looking for... for some time. I used to know Cathy, I think. Not the pretty one, the other one. Hi, it's Henrietta Norton Phillips here. I was told to call back Friday, I did. I was told to call back Sunday, I did. And I don't want to sound needy or anything. I'm totally available. I really want to get a gig, so please give me a call back. Oh, hello there. My friend who's an agent at your company sent them my tape and I just wanted to know what... well, what happened with it really. Alice Goodman? Hello. Hello. It's a nice residential area. There's mostly families here. Nice. There's a yoga studio down there. - Oh, that's cool. - Wow. If you'd like to. Oh, and the playground part is perfect. Right? Oh, you have kids? No. I... I love swings. She has a daughter, baby child. Well, I'm gonna... I'll file your paperwork and we'll get back to you. Sounds great. Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Enjoy your day. So, this is it, isn't it? - The location is great. It was just renovated. - Yeah. And you're like five minutes from me. It's like kind of perfect. Yeah. I don't know how I feel about the crown molding in the living room. Seriously? Yeah. Who cares about the crown molding? I do. I design houses. Then redesign the crown molding. Yeah, it was like the closets were strangely shaped, too. That's another thing I'll have to get over. I give up, Nolan. What? Why won't you move out of the Norton Phillips place? I'm trying to. I just haven't found the right place. Yeah, you've been saying that for months. This is the right place. And there were others that were really great, too, and you just... They weren't great. None of them were great. What was wrong with the one in Echo Park? The yard is extremely asymmetrical. I just don't get what all this is about. What is this about? I don't know. You're living in your dead boss' old house pretending that you're gonna renovate the deck. - I'm gonna renovate the deck. - Whatever. Do you understand how unstable this all makes you sound? More stable than the deck is. Which is why I really need to renovate it. You're kind of being a man-child. That's fair. So, I had a really great time. So glad you're on Tinder. Henri. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'll be right over. I just dropping off some files at my office. Okay. Did you just lie to somebody on the phone about having an office? That I just picked you up from a bar on a Tuesday morning? Bitch! Alice, is that you? Henri. Hey. Are you okay? You hurt? I think that I ruined it with Hunter. Good. That guy's an asshole. Is that it? This is all about a guy? I haven't been funny since he died. Henri. Hey, you're always funny. No, I don't feel very funny. I haven't written anything. Okay, okay, well, you just need to... to just write new things and... and... and get back on stage. Hey, it'll be fine, okay? I'm actually thinking of starting an app for girls like me that matches you up with guys that have no interest in dating. - Hey. - Hey. This box right here, it has your name on it. Yes, it does. What is that? Oh wow, I got you, yeah. What have we got in here? I don't know. - Whoa! Looks like your dad gave me some hand-me-downs. - Oh my God. What is this? No, I always told him I wanted his jacket! Well, actually it looks really... that works for you. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, very Houdini. Houdini. Oh. - It's a perfect fit? - No. Not my style, you think? No? Alright. Oh, yeah, here we go. Hey, you are like the guy in the movies, you know the one that, like, didn't know he was hot until he took his glasses off. I don't wear glasses. - Henrietta. Hi. - Hi. - Hey, Hunter. - What's your name? I'm Nolan. We went... we went to college together. You wore the light up shoes, didn't you? - Yep. - Hmm. I just stopped by to see if you happened to come to my house last night and, I don't know, destroy my lawn flamingoes and puke in my bushes. While you're out with some other girl. What? I mean, I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to cause trouble, but I saw you out and you were with another girl. And you followed me home? Are you fucking insane? What's wrong with you? Alright, I think that's enough. No, we went on one date. You have serious issues. Alright, she gets that you're mad. Can you just go? Um... I like him. I think I'm in love with him. Okay. Look, I actually just came over to tell you that I found an apartment. Oh, cool. - Yeah. So, I'm gonna be moving out. - Cool. Um... Um... Is it... is it nice? Yeah. No, it's great. It's... it's got like most amazing crown molding, so. Awesome. I love crown molding. Uh-huh. Hi, Sam. Oh, no, I didn't mean to... oh, you're married. You're married now? Okay, yeah, just call me back, okay. Hello? It's Henri Norton Phillips from college here. It's so great to hear your voice. Oh. Hello? You like living in Nebraska? How are you doing? It's Henrietta. Wait, you're a woman now? Wait, were you always a woman? Hey, it's Henri. Are you in LA? Oh, I'll always be in LA. And LA will always be in me. How did we first meet again? I was trying to get with your roommate freshman year, and she wasn't home. Oh, yeah. But I was home, right? I saw your show on the CW. You know the one with the monsters. Mutants. Yeah, Mutant High, quarterback Russ Denton. Poor kid has to traverse the hard road of high school sports while also being a mutant. Wow. I just now remember why we never dated seriously. It was because you were still in love with your ex. You were like obsessed with her. Oh my God. What? That's not true. Yeah, you wouldn't shut up about her. Okay, if I recall, you got obsessive. I always wish we'd talked more after our affair. Oh, would you call hooking up after the college production of The King and I an affair? There's just something about you that's always intrigued me, Henrietta. "Henrietta, your thesis about Cronus, God of time, was somehow funny and light-hearted. You didn't seem to grasp the goal of the assignment. C-minus." Wasn't Cronus like the Greek God who ate his own children? He's a fairly dark... Don't know. I didn't really get to read that part of the book. Brianna used to like books. Dude, everyone likes books. And the acting. My emotional recall is... Yeah. You know, she'd go to a bookstore or a library, and she... she'd pick out a book. - Yeah. - And she... she'd take it home, you know, and she'd read it. You sound like you're really meant to be together. She sounds perfect for you. - Oh my God. - Yeah. Just wait. When you least expect it, that's when I'll be acting. You don't have to do that. I can become what a person needs and wants the most, anytime. How are you feeling? Well, to be honest, I've been better. I'm so sorry to hear that. Tell me everything. Putting everyone in danger, hiding who you are. Funny story about... about this... this actor in the scene with me. You're different. - No training at all. - Okay, I'm a mutant. And I'm embarrassing, right. It shows, you can tell. You can tell. Sienna, wait. Just like, I mean, amateur hour on my show, nope. Oh, yeah, what's up bro? Yeah. My bad, guys. - Never mind me. - You've seen... I'm not here. Oh God, I'm pretty tired actually. Now, we have to duel. - Can we rewind it? Where's the... - About time. Dude, we saw it... we already saw it once. No, I'd like to rewind it though 'cause of that guy. Hang on a second. Hi. Hi. You're welcome. Yeah, no, I know. That's what I've been saying. You know, obviously, he doesn't deserve you. Look, you met him on a train in India, just, look... I got to go. - Hi, Ms. Norton Phillips. - Hi. - How are you doing? - I'm good. Yeah, I've come to pick up some paperwork. Right. Here it is. Yeah, and whilst I'm here, I... I'm just gonna go ahead and resign from the board, yeah. - Oh. - Yeah. - My God. - Yeah. That's too bad. Are you sure? Yeah. - Okay. - You know I'm not cut out for it. I don't have the right degree for it. So, that's like, that's the reason, and it's about time I move back to London. So, that's like there's a reason, so. Okay. Great. Okay. Well, we'll miss you in LA. Thanks. I'm basically. Okay. Good. Henri Norton Phillips. Terrance. Oh my God. - How are you? - You look amazing. - Well, thank you. Come here. - Yeah. - Let's chat. - Okay. Come here. Hi, sorry. Anyway, is the sex really good or something? Hey, I'm sorry, Terrance, for my weird presentation and giving you alcohol. It's just coffee. I drank again, Henri, you know. Part of being sober is putting yourself in tempting situations and being stronger than the urge to drink, you know, and I wasn't. And that's my fault. But I didn't go home and go on some epic bender, okay? I went back and I thought about my life and I thought about the company and I realized that it was because of your presentation. Watching you stand in front of those people and just talk all that nonsense and like rambling craziness you were doing, it was inspirational. It... it made me realize that I do want to have a better year. Wow. And it was fun, you know. - And I think fun is necessary sometimes. - Yeah. Thank you. Wow. Henri, I don't think you should quit just yet. Really? I think that you have a future here. I don't know what it is, but I think you can do some good here. Thank you, Terrance. I also think it might help if you applied the old-fashioned way. I know how to do that. I mean, I want to do that. Great. Well, then do it and come back and see me when you're done. But, you know, I am carving wooden lizards now, so if you're interested, I can get you the info. I know a guy. Um, can I... - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah. That makes sense. Look forward to the resume. Don't bring up the lizards, Terrance. Don't bring up the lizards, Terrance. Please, no pictures. I wasn't... Just trying to be a normal person here, dude. Hey, look, no one was taking a picture. It's not that, Henrietta. It's... look, I'm sorry, it's just that the limelight, it makes it just so hard to go on a date with a beautiful woman. You... you are. Okay, cool. Scoot, scoot, scoot. Here's our scoot. But I'd like to work with you on some on-camera stuff first. Alice? Jamison Lovett, repped by BK and Talent. Why you driving scoot? I don't want to talk about it. What kind of music do you like? You want some water or hard candies? Hey, look... What are you doing? No. So, what happened to... to TAA? Well, I still wasn't making enough money to pay my student loans or my other bills and there was so much pressure for everyone like, "Yeah, way to go, you did it. Congrats, Alice." I was like congrats on what? I was a glorified intern and, honestly, I was just really... I was really bored. So, I figured out I can make more money elsewhere and I quit. But Ava does not know. She does not know that I'm sneaking around at night providing rides for money. I mean, it's not like you're cheating on her or anything. What if, hypothetically, I... I was dating other people, I wasn't sleeping with them and... and... and I'm not attracted to them at all, but there is an emotional... an emotional connection, would that be considered cheating? Why would anyone do that? What are you talking about? - Okay, I don't know. - Why would anybody do that? No, I don't think so because... you sleeping with them if you wanted to, you just need to be less in to them than they are to you, so. - Who... - What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? - I don't know. I don't want to talk about this anymore. - Can we just change the subject? - It's just my opinion. Okay, look, I'm sorry that I was so obnoxious and insistent about the agent thing. No, I'm sorry. I should have been honest, and you know I would have helped you in any way that I could if I was still working there. Oh, I love you, Alice. Love you, too. I'm sorry. Oh my God, so bored. - It's okay. - Can we... can we go? Could we get going? Can you kick him out? This is your stop, dude. You're gonna have that... - Three of us maybe hang out? - No. - You want me to go? - Yes, please. - Adios. - I... - I've known him since college. - Since... oh my God. - And can you give this to your... to your agents at TA... - Your headshot? I'm gonna tear it up. Let's throw that shit out of the window. No. Nolan! I'm applying for a job at the Norton Phillips Company. I'd say my chances are pretty high being the whole daughter of the dead founder and all that. But I'm applying the old-fashioned way. "I think you sometimes look too far away for what is right in front of you." - Henri. - Whoa. - Are you okay? Sorry. - Hunter! Here. Hey. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. You look upset. Yeah, yeah, actually I'm... I'm not. We never said we were exclusive. Henri, look, I think you could be a great person potentially. Thanks. I really mean that. I think you could be awesome. I appreciate that. You just have all these quirks and things. Is that a bad thing? No, no, no, no, not at all, not if you realize there are ways to improve on who you are. Hey, you want to improve, right? "You want to improve, right?" Let's get dinner tomorrow night. Really? Yeah? Yeah. It'd be great. I'll call you. Thanks for coming in, Henrietta. First off, I want to emphasize that we found your application to be well written, very smart, and extremely creative, which is all very important to us. So, we would love to offer you a position here. Unfortunately, the competition for this job was very high and we did have to go with someone else. I'm so sorry. Our hiring is actually based on an application process that was put in place by your father himself and we do keep to that. You're just not as qualified on paper as we needed you to be. You can still keep your position on the board where you don't even have to do anything, best of both worlds. Internet service is a lot like my father. It doesn't do what it promises and then dies. I guess the thing about having an emotionally unavailable father is that you can't really call him an absent father because it's not like he hasn't done anything for you, I mean he's put a roof over your head, he's sent you to school, but he's not really there. But when it really comes to it, there's this coolness, like, this... this... this kind of distance. He just never really learned how to express himself. And you're kind of like, "Hey dad, I'm here." And even if he did care, he'd just never show up. Even if he were still around, this has clouded every relationship in my life. What? Well, that was interesting. Let's welcome to the stage our next comic. Hey, guys. So, does anyone else just like hate waiting in lines, right? No, but seriously like I'm actually really worried because of this avocado shortage. I mean, I don't even know if I can even function without them. I can't even. - I'm a lesbian. - So, what's up? What? I'm a lesbian. I'm not interested in men. Why am I always falling in love with lesbians? What? So, you want to watch that marathon with that flying wizard boy from Dusseldorf? Wait, wait, wait, you're not mad? Why would I be mad? I don't... I don't know, I just... I guess I assumed you'd be mad. I told you I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. But I'm done trying to force people to be something that they're not just to fit my needs. I'm not gonna do that. But if you don't start it now, we're gonna miss the Prisoner of Aquazar, Aquaman, Aqua... It's Azkaban. Oh, it is. Jeez. So, it's really funny though. And the guys' dorm room always smelled so gross. No, that was your dorm room that smelled so bad. Oh, man, college, you were disgusting. Oh, it's a really good song. Can you turn it up? Yeah. Hey, sing, I know you know that. Oh no, I'm not a good singer. Seriously? I just find it very disrespectful to the musician when people who can't keep a tune sing over the artist's work. Hey, the musician isn't here. ♪ Tell me about tonight ♪ It also just ruins the listening experience. Wait, Henri. Nolan. Nolan, I know it's you, I know you're in there. Nolan, why are you showering in my place? I didn't think you were home. That really explains nothing. Was there no hot water at your place? Yep. Yeah, there's no hot water. I can tell you're lying. Is it because of me? Are you kidding? You think I have nothing better to do than just like hanging out and shower? Then explain to me why you're showering in my place. I couldn't do it. I couldn't move into that apartment. It didn't feel right and I just... I couldn't leave this place yet. Why not? Your dad was important to me. Like he was a big part of my life all through college and, like, and any success I had like I really owe it to him. And I feel like leaving this house kind of, I don't know, made me feel like that was gone. I don't know. It's... Yeah. Well, I know he really cared about you. Look, saying this might not matter right now, but proving yourself to him was the wrong goal. I mean, who cares what your dad or your boyfriend or me or some old man at a comedy TV show thinks about you. Just think about what you want. Stay as long as you want in the house. Is there any toilet paper out there? Henri? Some tea? No, I'm more of a coffee guy actually. Want a Pop-Tart? I've had a really bad week, guys. I didn't get hired at a company that I own. I mean seriously, how unqualified do you have to be to like not get hired at a place that you own? I mean, it's basically like owning a house and the pool guy and the maids are like, "I'm sorry, I don't think you can live here anymore." Seriously. And technically, I could have told her, "Do you know who I am?" But, of course, she knows who I am, right, a spoiled little shit. Dad, it's Alice. Alice. Hi. Is everything okay? Yeah, no, everything's fine. Do you want me to put your mom on? No, no, I was actually... I was calling to talk to you. Yeah, the... the car's... the car's fine. I was just, you know, hoping you and I could talk and catch up about some things. Maybe, not right now, Alice, another time. Yeah, yeah, another time. Okay. Bye. I've never gone hiking with you. Henri. - Hey, what's up? - Thank God. - What are you guys doing? - Just eating my post-breakup feelings. How was your day? Oh, you guys broke up? Yeah, no, I just... I just wanted more time, you know, devote to the deck renovating. Yeah, when is that gonna be finished? I don't know. Soon. What are you guys watching? Sunsets. Class is about to start. See you after sixth period? Of course. I think I need to go back to my home planet. I mean, we'll miss you but if you think that's for the best. I just think I've done all I can here. Maybe I could come and visit. Probably be really busy with other stuff. Later. This is nice. Yeah. I don't remember this many ants when I came here with dad. No, yeah, people usually don't remember stuff like ants. Does that mean when we look back we're not gonna remember the ants either? Pretty sure all I'm gonna remember is the ants. I have to tell you something. Yeah? There are literally ants in my underwear right now. Oh my God, this is horrible. Yeah, no, it is awful. Can we, please. Let's just go. Let's go. I've also started seeing someone, I mean like a real person, not a stick pic. So, I'm astounded at how much free time I have now that I'm not chasing the approval of different men. I'm actually chasing my own approval. Thanks so much, guys. You've been wonderful. Cheers. Bye.
