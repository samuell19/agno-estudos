What do we do now? Back to plan "a". What's plan "a"? Don't get shot. Good plan. Shit, I didn't even get to finish my beer. No holes? No holes. So, our work here is done, right? Done. Let's go, man. Oh. What's wrong? It's time to come home, Toby. I think you better go. No, we can kick his ass. He's the last one. Come on, me and you. I'm serious, Malik. You don't want to fight this guy. Fuck that. We'll kick his ass and take his coat. You see those glasses he got? All right, no more playing. Absolutely. Time for you to get the hell out of here. What? Hey, get off that, man. I told you I got your back. Listen, Malik, you have a wife and a daughter. Now, go home. Go! Hey. It's my favorite cheese-eating dick monkey. You ain't so bad. I ain't so bad. You hit like a girl, motherfucker. Let's go. You think you're bad? I know I'm bad. Let's go. I'll show you something big, long, and nasty. What the fuck? Time for a whipping, boy. There's been a fluctuation in the adrenaline level. His body may be nearing the point of exhaustion. Boost the implants on the advanced model. Which ones? Every one. Atta boy. Let her buck. I don't have to kill you. You can return with me to Hong Kong. No. No. System overload. You pulled a whip on me? Are you out of your fucking mind? Let me tell you something. Don't you ever pull a whip on a black man again. On a black man again. Total system failure. We'll simply make more. So, he wasn't so bad, was he? Nah. Come on. We have a paycheck to collect. Yeah, you got an employee to pay. You get a bonus. Oh, I like that. You get a bonus. Oh, I like that. Time to blow. Time to blow? Shit! All right, tobe, let's get going. We got money to collect. We got hotels to build. And a wife and kid to go home to. Exactly. Yes. Wife and kid. Yeah, man. You know what, I'm gonna... I'm going to do everything I can to make it work this time. Who is she kidding? She can't live without me. She's a lucky girl. There you go. I think I might have to pull out there you go. I think I might have to pull out my tiger fists on that cheeseburger, though. I hate that guy. Yeah, me, too. And you can buy a new car, too. I sure can. You know what I like? I like the '64 Chevy Malibu convertible. Why is that? I saw it in a movie once. I did. It figures. A movie once. A movie once. Well, I think we've done all the damage we can here. Let's go blow something up in L.A., man. I'm right behind you. We ain't got a car. Let's just take this blue Taurus here. I know how to carjack. Do you? Yeah, yeah. ♪
