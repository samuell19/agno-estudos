LazyTown Presents In partnership with The National Theater Robbie Rotten in LazyTown By Magnús Scheving Directed by Sigurðar Sigurðjónssar There is never a moment of peace in this town! Here we go again with the morning workout... Ziggy! You have to do it like this! - Sorry, sorry, I got a little carried away! This is LazyTown, a completely intolerable town. Its residents are always ready to help each other day in and day out.... ...they walk or bike to work... ...they are always eating healthy food and growing their gardens... ...and they exercise every single day. I will have you know that when I moved here, many years ago, it was good to be here. Then, one could simply sleep until noon, nap in the afternoon, and relax in the evening! But now, now I have to wake up every single morning to cock-a-doodle-doo for everyone in town. I am so hoarse, and it is all because of that lovesick mayor! And how much does one of these wonder-appliances cost? Included for free?! Bessie dear! Bessie! I am on the phone, can't you see that? Yes... Robbie Rotten walks free! What?! - It says here in the newspaper. Look... Oops! I'm not supposed to be walking in the flowerbed. Kids! Kids! We completely forgot to stretch, and Sportacus says that we are always supposed to stretch after exercising! Yeah! - And stretch! It really changed for the worse when Sportacus came here. He expected that I, imagine this, that I would start moving. Hey, Sportacus! Yes, hello man, hello! Sportacus! Here I am, smarter, and more agile than ever before Brisk as the wind, I just can't stand still I can clap! So can we! Same here! Don't get left in the dust, just repeat after me Let's all go as fast as we can and sing One, two, and all together No one's lazy in LazyTown Three, four, this much I'm sure of No one's lazy in LazyTown Ok, everyone ready? Yeah! Now repeat after me Clap, clap, thighs, thighs, cross, out, up, up! Clap, clap, thighs, thighs, cross, out, up! Oh no! My hat is telling me that someone is in trouble in BullyTown! BullyTown? Unfortunately, I have to go help out. But Sportacus! - Yes? What will happen to us? Yeah, who will train with us? Don't worry about that at all! It has been a long time since you've learned how important it is to eat good, healthy food, right? And to exercise regularly. Oh, yes! And... To do your homework. Yes, I am the best at doing my homework. I am sure that you will find something fun to do! Yeah, I am going to learn how to use this ball, Sportacus. Good, Pixel! You should always listen to your heart, do what you know is right, and then everything will be just fine! Yeah! - Now I need your help! Right! - Stand back! And... Ladder! There you go. And... pull the balloon down! Is everyone ready? - Yeah! And Ziggy, remember not to eat too much candy while I am away. Right, only on Saturdays. Ideally, try not to eat any candy. - Right. I'm sure you will find someone to exercise with you, right? Sportacus! - Yes? I will make sure to work them like dogs. - Trixie! No one should be worked that hard. Oh, then what am I supposed to do? You could, for example, take turns leading the exercises! Yeah! For example, I could teach ballet! Wow! Very nice, Ziggy! It's ready! Up with the ladder! Ready... Are you holding on tight, Stephanie? - Yes, I am holding on as tightly as I can. Are we ready? - The ropes are untied! Yes, we are ready. B-b-b-but... ...when are you coming back, Sportacus? It is almost time for the sports festival, and I will be back in time for that! You have nothing to fear. LazyTown will not get into any trouble, because the town is in good hands with Mayor Meanswell! Yeah! Bye bye, see you later, bye! See you later, good luck! - Bye! Bye, Sportacus!

Oh, a perfect town for me! Absolutely amazing, absolutely amazing... - I have to get away from this town. What is all the commotion? What is all this noise? What is going on here? Oh no! - Bessie dear. Bessie, are you okay? Hey! Just a moment, there, just a moment! It is not allowed to park cars here. Oh? Why not? Didn't you see the sign? No, what sign? Right here. No, what sign? Right here. No parking. Aha! You clearly have no idea who I am. No, but I distinctly recognize the car, however. The car? - Officer, what is happening here? This man illegally parked here. I am not talking about how he parked, but the reckless driving that scared the life out of us all. Yes, and how some of my very expensive dresses have now been ripped. So, that's how it is! - Yes! One illegally parked car... I can- ...one damaged old distasteful dress... I can pay for that... - Old?! Yes, it is an antique. That raises the fine. You obviously have no idea who I am. Nope! Who are you, might I ask? I am Richy Rich! What!? Does that mean that you are tremendously rich, or what, huh? Not only rich, but also powerful. I know men in the highest places, even... ...the President! We know each other so well, that we even drive perfectly identical cars. We received a letter from the president once. Yes, we sure did, and I have even spoken to him on the phone. Well, that was only his answering machine. No, that- - Well... ...there is a sports festival in every town in the country and we in LazyTown took part in it, and won the President's Cup. Yeah! Really now, huh? - Yeah! Well, I don't just get a letter from the president. - Really? We have often gone out to dinner together. - Wow... We have often gone to the movies together. - The movies? And... I have given him foot massages! And, when the president gets into trouble, he always asks me for advice! Wow, really? Does the president ever get into trouble? Very rarely, but if it happens- Then he gives him good advice! Yes, well, of course you can park your car here, by all means. Yes, Richy, you can park the car here however you want. Debbie, Bessie here. Guess who just showed up? Officer Obtuse here can even keep it clean for you and polish it if you want. Sure. - I'm supposed to polish the car? Yes, of course you will polish the car for the man. He is a friend of the president. Good morning. - Good morning. And welcome to the town. Right then. No, Mayor... Excuse my appearance and their poor manners before. It's fine. Tell me something, Richy. Yes? How much money do you have? How much money? -Yes! I am not feeling well after all the driving. Oh dear, well, I think I need a nap. And since I am Richy Rich, I will of course be getting the nicest and most expensive room in the hotel. Yes, I will take care of that. - Really? Right, and you, miss! What, me? Be fancy. - Okay. What the? For God‘s sakes, have a different hairstyle tomorrow. This one is a total disaster! You are a total cutie with that hairstyle. Bessie, dear. Bessie... Maybe I will just hang around, eh? I've tricked them all! We are half way done! Stop! Stop! I will lead now. This is not good enough. We won't make any progress with this kind of fooling around. But look, it's so cool! Ziggy! Stop. We are supposed to take turns. Yeah... One hundred and sixteen push-ups. One hundred and sixteen!? Yep. Stingy, Stingy, Stingy, jump apart and then together. Clap your hands together. Feet above your head. Jives, do a triple somersault. Backwards. With... ...a quadruple twist. Trixie! Trixie, no! Stop! We are finished! Get up! Get up, lazybones. Trixie, you are being mean. We are finished. No, no, kids, this is necessary. No! Yes, to become stronger! No! - Don't bully us! Owie, owie! Owie, owie! My butt! My butt! What are you doing, Officer? - I'm dancing. What dance? - Bossa Nova. Good morning, Richy Rich. - Good morning, Officer. I have polished your car so well, that you can use it as a mirror. Yeah? Let me see. Yes, excellent, excellent. I've put fresh air in the tires and fresh mud on the mudguards. And then I cleaned the exhaust pipe on the inside. On the inside? Well, that is excell- Officer Obtuse, it seems to me though, that there is still a little dirt there under the car. Really? Well, I will fix that right away! You do that, Officer. I am counting on you, stupid and gullible townsfolk. But now, I just need to find some place to sell my canned food. Yo! - Yo! There was once a guy and the guy was me This guy thought existence was so miserable I was completely powerless and miserably weak And awfully skinny, never given any thought Then I realized the truth contained in these words Everything depends on what we eat From vegetables I get a power boost That is the heart of it all and I must never forget it Never forget it If I don't forget to eat I am incredibly strong There is never any pain in my muscles or my bones I feel the power in my hands and the power in my legs I can pull up large plants by the roots And I who have the build and great muscles I know that it is wrong to bully smaller ones No smart person does that That is stupid, and I must never forget it Never forget it! Yo! Totally! - Yo! That's what I'm sayin'! - That's what I'm sayin', yo. What are you doing, young man? Huh, me? - Yes. Do you totally want a beet or carrot? No, thank you very much. I do not want that disgusting vegetable grossness at all! There is no label on this to tell me the contents. It could be anything. It could be very dangerous! Yo, I know this vegetable. I totally grew it myself. “I totally grew it myself.” This vegetable is gross, it has to grow, and that takes way too long. If you want something, you are supposed to get it instantly! Now, there is something exciting. There is paper rustling. Yeah, that's my friend Ziggy. What can Ziggy do about the fact that he is so sweet? And that he likes to goof around sometimes? I was so startled! May I offer you some wonderful goodies from this can? Yes, thank you. I will not refuse these glittering treats. I knew it. Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yum. What is happening in this town? Rabbit food. Ew. What is happening in this town? Rabbit food. Ew. No, thank you very much. Not for me. I have plenty of real candy here in my pocket, Ziggy. You have to admit, Ziggy, that chocolate is much better than vegetables. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, Ziggy! - Yes? Have you forgotten? - What? Chocolate has a sort of... a sort of... ...a short term energy, man, yo, yo! Short term energy, yes, Ziggy. That's exactly right. If you need more energy, then you just eat more and more chocolate caramels and fill yourself up with sweet energy. There is talk of just one candy day per week. One candy day per week? - Yes! Exactly! See, on Saturdays, Sportacus always says that it is best to not eat candy at all but if you are going to eat candy, then- Stop! This is some of the biggest nonsense that I have ever heard! You know, maybe this is totally true, what he is saying. You know, listen to me. One candy day per week is not enough. You can't- yes! Expect someone to eat candy on one day for a whole week! No! It would be better to have candy day always be every other day. No! Every hour on the hour! You would never run out of energy! Ziggy! Don't attack me! Everybody, jump, jump, jump, jump! Bye, kids! No, come on, Stingy, you are also supposed to dance with us. Bing Bang Dingalingaling Yes, it's best to push yourself and stretch Bing Bang Dingalingaling Yes, it's best to shake off your stiff body Time to loosen all of your limbs And finally time to step up And sing Bing Bang Dingalingaling Yes, it's time to shake off your fatigue Bing Bang Dingalingaling Yes, it's time to loosen up your whole body Just look at how flexible she is! Once, she was so stiff that she couldn't even tie her shoelaces! Bing Bang Dingalingaling I start by shaking only my hands Bing Bang Dingalingaling Then I shake my left and right legs Then I shake my head Then nimbly and energetically do a split - Wow! We all sing Bing Bang Dingalingaling Yes, it's time to shake off your fatigue Bing Bang Dingalingaling Yes, it's time to loosen up your whole body And then stretch, stretch, stretch and stretch. Woops! I completely forgot to tie my shoelaces! But you know, now I can tie my shoelaces all by myself! Excuse me, my dear, but are you tying your shoelaces? That is no longer fashionable. Shoelaces should be loose! Oh, really? - Yes! I didn't know that, but I just learned to do it. - Hmm! Once, I couldn't even reach my toes. But now, look how flexible I am. But wait, why? I practice every day! Or almost every day... sometimes I accidentally forget! It is best, by far, to just completely forget about it, because exercising only creates problems. Sportacus can do a handstand! Yeah! Sportacus can do a handstand, huh? Who do you think doesn't know how do a handstand? It's easy, just watch. You just do it like so. Oh dear, Richy! - I'm okay, I'm okay. You can get badly hurt, see? And for what? To be able to be like a ballet dancer, right? Try, all of you, to stay fashionable. - Okay. It is fashionable everywhere else in the world to do as little as possible, and to just slouch around. Bent knees, stiff arms, and slouching around. Yes, everybody, slouch arou- Ziggy, stop hopping like a bunny. Slouch around. Yes, like that, yes, great, Stephanie, great. And Jives, bent knees, hunched down, and slouch around. Richy? - Yes? Is this really the current fashion? Everywhere in the world and now here as well! No, stop Trixie! Wow! A strike! What is happening in this town? Didn't I say to slouch around and not to run around? Yes. Where are you running off to, young man? I am rushing home to finish my homework. These books are mine. Study? Why study? Why? - Yeah. Education is one of the most valuable things that we have, because it can not be taken away from you. I am Richy Rich and my money will never be taken from me. That money is mine, Richy! Oh! This is your money, oh I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Nobody will actually become rich from studying, young man, but by being selfish and doing only what is fun. And now, Stingy, I will ask you one question: is it fun to study? Yes! That's mine! Give it! Give it! No! Never think about the future or the past! Stingy! - Yes? Can you count, add, and subtract? Yes, of course. Then you don't have to know anything else, because that is enough to know how to count your money! Therefore, you can see that studying other things is a waste of time. “A waste of time.” Wait! I want to introduce you to my great friend. A waste of time? What, then have we been wasting precious time on reading and writing and drawing and... It was all so very fun. Do you think that maybe candy is healthier than fruits and vegetables? Oh, Zigg- Pixel, you shouldn't be playing with the electricity! Pixel, did you get a computer virus, or what? On the computer screen Life is a game Bright and pure and clear And super sharp Too bad our lives Are not remote controlled What's missing from the world is a keyboard Also a joystick and mouse A good CD drive and a good hard disk Without them I am out of my element I run poorly when I need my megabytes A good CD drive and a good hard disk Without them I am out of my element I run poorly when I need my megabytes What is that? - Wow, it blinks! Look! - Can I see? No, Trixie. Trixie! You crashed my computer. Yoohoo! Hi ho! Here are Dan's Cans with fresh, quick fruit straight from the can. No cooking hassle! Nobody has to sit down to eat! Nobody has to go home and cook or wash the dishes! You can eat fresh fruit and vegetables from a can while standing up. I think we would rather pick fresh vegetables straight from the garden. Yes, but these are fresh vegetables straight from the can, don't you understand? Hey, c-c-c-can we taste? Unfortunately, you can't have a sample before you buy the can. Would you want to buy a can that someone else already opened? No, of course not. We don't want to buy any cans. We have grown our own vegetables ourselves, totally! Owie! What am I supposed to do? They really want to grow that disgusting vegetable garbage themselves. And I was going to make so much money from my canned food. I don't know what I am supposed to- Now I know what I'll do! Yoohoo! Look into this window, for example. In this window, there is nothing being quickly offered. Everything there in this window takes too much time to prepare, and is no longer fresh when it is finally ready. But packaged and canned food, that is completely different. It is just packed into the packaging. Swish, bang, and done! And... it costs nothing. Almost nothing. Just a few coins. Just look how expensive everything is in the store? Do you see, do you see, do you see? Yoohoo! Here is one can for you to sample. Yoohoo! Yayayaoo! Here are Dan's cans with fresh, quick fruit straight from the can! - This is just like from our garden. Something tastes different. Yeah, no, no, no, no no. I don't want to try anything new. Ziggy, but then you won't know whether it's good or bad. I just judge it by its looks and it looks to me like it is rather bad. No, you know, Ziggy, this is not so bad at all. Well, wasn't that a good solution to your problems, quick and fresh? Yes, but we, the kids in LazyTown, just grow fresh vegetables ourselves in our own garden. Yeah! - Sportacus, says- I don't want to hear you talk about this Sportacow! I mean, you don't want to be like that sports elf? That jumping elf that just farts around in his air balloon? Ziggy, eh? No, of course not. - No. And Jives, you don't want your fingernails to be so dirty all day. You are like a mole. Well, this is all clean dirt. Clean dirt. This is very dirty dirt, what else would it be? Just look at my fingernails. Wrong hand, sorry. They are completely clean because I am not doing any dirty work all day like you. And your fingernails, Ziggy! Disgusting! Well, that is just chocolate under my fingernails, yes. Chocolate? - Yeah. Do you want the caramel that I have here in my pocket? No, actually I rather want that strawberry there in the garden. What nonsense! You're welcome. Yo, Ziggy. It's not candy day today. - What? Out with it. Yeah, thank you very much. Ziggy! There's more. What? - Out with it. Ziggy, Ziggy, let's just stick with the fresh picks from my garden. From our garden, Stingy. Right, there will be a sports festival soon and fruit, vegetables, and fish are the healthiest things that athletes can eat. Right, not candy. No, Ziggy. "Right, not candy." "No, Ziggy." No, don't. I am not supposed to eat so much candy. No more candy. You won't get any more. Won't get more candy, no more, no. They really want to grow those disgusting vegetables themselves! And I was going to make so much money on my canned food! What am I supposed to do? Now I know what I will do... I will talk to them of course, because they are so... ...special! Graffiti and broken glass everywhere A flipped over ashtray spread all around Cigarette butts on the sidewalk, smoked and easily grabbed Hey you, get lost We are The MayhemTown Gang Ding dong ditching, cursing, and being rude Breaking windows and picking locks We pee in the streets We steal piggybanks Hey you, leave now We are The MayhemTown Gang The gang that never takes a bath We are The MayhemTown Gang Hey LazyTown, we will take you over We are The MayhemTown Gang The MayhemTown Gang If something needs breaking We will take care of it We are The MayhemTown Gang The MayhemTown Gang Guys! Meow! Woof! Why on earth are you so late? Didn't I tell you to be on time? What is this, man? You know that we smoke and can't get around very quickly. It takes time. And if we stay up late, we are always so grumpy in the morning. But what can we do for you? Yes, and how much will we get paid? I know that you are ugly... - Uh huh. ...boring... - Uh huh. ...selfish... - Uh huh. ...smelly... - Uh huh. ...mischievous... - Uh huh. ...thievish... - Uh huh. You forgot one; grumpy. - Uh huh. Yes, and stupid! - Uh huh. Wait, where did he go? Meow! Woof! I have a very easy assignment for you, MayhemTown Gang. What is it? Tonight you will sneak into every garden in LazyTown... And steal all of the fruit and all of the vegetables! Are you having problems at home? We would never come near such an abomination. And what are you going to do with vegetables, Robbie? What am I going to do with vegetables? - Yeah. I'm going to throw them in the trash! Shhhhhhhh! Meow! Woof! Can you stop doing that? I'm going to sell everyone a different brand! My brand! I am relying on you, MayhemTown Gang. MayhemTown Gang? MayhemTown Gang! Can you-?! MayhemTown Ga- Can you stop that?! MayhemTown Gang! MayhemTown Gang... MayhemTown Gang... What are you doing? Are you stealing all of the vegetables? Yes, the vegetables, my dear fellows, take them all. Jives's garden here is full of them. Back to fast food... Please, rid us of it all! What are you looking at, rooster wretch!? Time to make a basket for my dear Bessie. Fruit and vegetables... what? No vegetables? And no fruit? What is going on? What is going on, Mister Mayor? Where is the fruit basket that I've received every single day without fail? Bessie, dear... - Yes? Well, when I came out this morning, to the garden... ...all of the fruit and vegetables were gone from my garden. Everything is gone from the entire town! What are you saying? All of the vegetables gone from all of the gardens in town? This is Trixie's fault. That is just like her. It is amazing how some children can behave. Lack of discipline after lack of discipline. Bessie, dear, we can't accuse anyone without having any proof. Then we must call for a town meeting immediately, Mister Mayor! I will call for a town meeting, right away. All residents of LazyTown, report to a town meeting right away. It is very important that everyone attends. Important? - Yes, well... Something terrible happened last night. - What!? Somebody has gone through all of the gardens in town and has stolen all of the vegetables and all the fruit from them. No! Officer Obtuse is investigating this mysterious criminal offense! - I had nothing to do with it. Yes, calm down, calm down. I have investigated this mysterious crime, and I have discovered a few things. For example... ...I've discovered that I have no idea who did this. No? - No clue. However, I have, because it would be just like her! Trixie?! - No, no, no! We cannot blame anyone without proof. Excuse me, excuse me! -We have to stick together. May I interrupt, may I interrupt? I just received the horrible news! It's so tragic! What? About the fruits and the vegetables. Ah, yes, yes... But of course, everyone make mistakes. Especially.... Bullies! But since I am such a kind-hearted individual... ...I don't want you to toil, plow, and sweat to grow more vegetables in these disgusting- - What?! - In these incredibly well made vegetable gardens of yours. These vegetables take so long to grow and you never know how the harvest will go. Yes, but Richy, then what are we supposed to do? My dear, Bessie. - Yes? What should you do? - Yes! Help each other, of course! Yeah! And it just so happens that here in town is my friend, the savior, Dan Can! Ah! Dan Can! My friend Dan Can can sell you canned fruits and vegetables at market value, and that is how we can all help each other! Life is so easy and everything so simple Everything is so prepared and so smooth So happy and cheerful If everyone helps each other Then life becomes so easy There isn't anything to worry about Everything is great Nobody will leave you behind It is indeed true That some crook has ruined this town's life But we still know that if everyone would only help each other Then everything in life becomes so easy Now sing it with me! Richy is the best - Richy is the best Yeah! If you look up in the dictionary What's wrong and what's right, it's written there That if everyone would only help each other Then everything in life becomes so easy And all together now! There isn't anything to worry about Everything is great Nobody will leave you behind It is indeed true That some crook has ruined this town's life But we still know that if everyone would only help each other Then everything in life becomes so easy Everyone sing along! Richy is the best - Richy is the best Yes! Yes! Richy is the best - Richy is the best Well, well, well, dear children, we adults need to talk for a bit now. Yes, of course. Listen to me, guys... - Yes. ...tell me, what about the culprit? Well, first we need to find some proof. Actually, I have a suggestion. Bessie, Mayor Meanwell, and Officer Obtuse... ...I suggest that we put Trixie in jail! Huh? Put Trixie in jail? - Yes, yes, yes, just to be safe. We never know what she might do next. But only for a little while, right? - Yes, yes, yes. Trixie. - Yes? Richy really wants you to go to jail. Just to be safe! Oh, okay... - Just to be safe... Do you really think that Trixie took all of the fruits and vegetables? Huh? So far, she has only done things that are bad. Yeah... Jives, where are you going? I am going to grow the garden. What? He is going to grow his garden! What for? What for? To harvest! Yeah! I thought that we all agreed at the meeting just a bit ago to only get fruits and vegetables from Richy Rich, right? Yeah! When will you learn, Ziggy? Don't you remember that Sportacus told us that if we work hard in growing our garden, then our harvest will reflect that! Yeah! Yes, but it's so much trouble! - Yeah! It's much easier to just buy fruits and vegetables from Dan Can and Richy Rich! Yeah! And I also have the money for it. And time is money, my friend. - Yeah! And then you can also use your time for something more fun! Yeah, like for example, just watching TV! - Yeah! Weather, news, cartoons, movies, documentaries, commercials, the end-of-transmission, and the test screen! But Pixel, what about all of the outdoor games? Skateboarding and ball games? I will just learn about these ball games on the internet. Yeah! And Sportacus won't know anything about what I'm going to do because he's not here. Later. Later! What Pixel is saying is totally true. - Yeah. You should never do anything that is hard or boring. Only what is fun. And that is also what Richy Rich says. - Yeah. He did say that! I've heard him say it many times. Hey! Stephanie! Can you- Stephanie! Hey, yo! Ziggy! - Yes? Do you want to help me a little here in my garden? Hold this. Yo, Ziggy, you are supposed to take it like this and then... You have become really strong, Jives, now that you are eating well. Do you remember how weak you used to be? When you only ate coco balls and were always gassy? Totally! No, not this, now. Hey, yo, Ziggy! - Yeah? Come over to my house for some porridge, yo! Yeah... Right... How exciting... Again, I stand alone Though I did nothing wrong Blamed for something I didn't do Still they shout at me Vandal Bully I hear their words but there's no proof No matter, I am strong I will prove them all wrong Proudly, and plainly, and certainly And everybody else can do whatever they want Because I can do this all by myself I don't care because I stand strongly by myself I am doing just fine I don't need those people Don't need any friends I can do this all by myself Is LazyTown in trouble? I must stop the balloon, go down there, and see what's going on. I see. I came from GreedyTown... ...am heading to LiarTown, but I can make a stop here in LazyTown. Perfect. But first, I need to check the wind stream. I do it like this and then... Yes, there is a mild wind. Then, I need to check the balance. I do that like this. Wait a minute, There is not enough air in the balloon! I need to pump more air into it. Pump! One... And two... And three! One more time, so I can go faster. One! Now I'm on my way! Aha! Gymnastics! Follow me, come on now! Everyone move! And begin! One and two and three and four... And apart, together. One, and two, and three... Wait... what... what is wrong with you? Haven't you been eating enough sportscandy? Yes, we have been eating lots of sportscandy. Yeah, I have eaten lots of candy. What? Listen, no, not candy, see, he has been eating lots of vegetables, fruit... - Good, good. He said candy. No, sportscandy. Exactly. Sportacus calls fruits and vegetables sportscandy. Yeah, yeah... Yes, all right, well, we may have been eating a little different kind of fruit. How so? From a can. - Yeah, from a can. A can? - Yep. Wait, wait, why are you eating fruits and vegetables from a can? Jives, what...? Well- Shhh! - Well- Well one morning when we woke up, all the vegetables were gone from the gardens. Huh? - Yeah! Gone from the gardens? - Yep! From every single garden? - Yes! Even here? Sportacus, come here. We had finished shoveling and planting just like you told us to do. Right, and then what? Then everything was just gone. - Yeah... It must be true. You were all looking so tired and pale. Jives was like this... I was more like this... Yes, exactly. - Yeah. Listen... Did it all just disappear, swish, bang, done? Exactly! I see... - I see... Why don't we just grow the gardens from scratch? Can we do that? Yes, of course you can do that! You can do anything you want! It is so hard though. Ziggy.... Don't tickle me! No, I won't tickle you. You can't give up even if you are having trouble. Once, I was going to learn to do a handstand and I had to do this... Like this, see. I just kept falling and I was ready to give up. You? Give up? Yes, but... ...then my grandmother told me that I should never give up. And you know what? I started eating healthy food every single day, went to sleep early, and I exercised regularly. And then, I could do this... At the start of summer, then I could do this... Then all of a sudden, in August, I could do this... Think of it! In August! - Yeah! Yes, but wait, what does the handstand have to do with this? Well, he is saying that we are not supposed to give up so easily! Exactly! What if we all worked together and grew the gardens from scratch?! Yeah! - With teamwork! Sportacus, welcome back to LazyTown. Hello, Mayor. And Officer Obtuse. Mayor Meanswell! - Yes? We are going to grow our gardens again from scratch! Yeah! - That sounds good to me... ...but what about seeds and fertilizer and things like that? I will take care of that! Yeah? I will throw bags of seeds down to you from my balloon! Yeah! LazyTown stands together! - Give it to me! I am open here! Yes, give it here! LazyTown, by far the best town that I know. - And... there you go! I'm open here! LazyTown stands together! LazyTown, by far the best town that I know. LazyTown stands together! This Sportacus has ruined everything for me! I was going to make so much money from my canned food, and he's ruined that! But I always have more schemes, oh yes. I am going to poison everybody in town. Yes! Quiver in fear, filthy flowers! I am going to poison all of the vegetables and all of the fruit, so that everyone will become sick to their stomachs! No! And then, they will be forced to buy a special food powder from me, which I am going to produce and make a lot of money from. Sportacus, try and stop me now! Almost finished picking a basket for my dear Bessie. This is becoming quite beautiful. What? This is all spotted! I've never seen this before. It must be in fashion, yes. Bessie, dear! - Yes? Here comes your fruit basket. - Thank you. Indeed! Listen, they are spotted now. What do you mean, spotted? Yes, I think it's in fashion. Oh, how nifty. Yes, there is so much in fashion these days. Good morning, mister Mayor. Good morning, Stephanie my dear. It's a beautiful day! Yeah! Oops! Stepping in the flowerbed is not allowed. Bessie, my dear, what is wrong? Can't you see that I have become very ill from the fruit that you just gave to me? Very ill? Yes, and you have spots on your face! What do you mean? Do I really have spots on my face? Yes! Dear lord! They must have been extremely poisonous! What is going on here? Well, now it's not so good, man. Ziggy is sick, Pixel is sick to his stomach, and I am a bit ill as well. Stephanie, get to a doctor right away! - Okay! Come on, kids, go and get yourselves checked out! What an event! All of the fruit has been poisoned and everyone in town has become sick to their stomach! Who could have poisoned all of the fruit? It must have been Trixie! Officer, Trixie is in jail. You're right. Then we have to look for evidence. Absolutely. Hey! Mayor Meanswell! - What? Look over here! - What is that? A poison sprayer! Wow! And here! Poisonous, spotted fruit! I'm familiar with that one. Don't eat it! Just kidding. Oh, Officer... Do you see that? - What is it? A mysterious footprint in the flowerbed. Officer, do you recognize this? Trixie's slingshot! Right next to the footprint! We will make Trixie step in the footprint, and then we will find out the fact of the matter. People of LazyTown, report to a fitting. The case is going to be solved. What? The case is being solved now. Officer Obtuse will take care of it. Officer? What? Trixie. - Yes? Is this your slingshot? Yes! It sure is! - Yes, now. Hush, hush. Please step in this footprint here. Here you go. Thanks. What?! It doesn't fit! - What?! Then it wasn't Trixie! That means that everyone in town is a suspect! No! Don't leave! - No! Hold on, hold on, single file, single file. Thank you. - Pixel, Stephanie, come back. Now everyone will step in the shoe print. - Yes. Officer Obtuse will manage this. - Ziggy! Ziggy! Ziggy! Please don't take your shoes off. There will be such a terrible smell. Pixel, stop playing with your computer. It interferes with the investigation, okay? Well, who wants to go first? I will go first. I am the mayor. A little... - Yes, please. Doesn't fit. - Nope. Stingy? - Okay. Doesn't fit. I just want to say that I did not take the fruits and the vegetables, I swear. Doesn't fit. Yes, well, I did not poison the fruits and vegetables! I often thought about it, but I never did it! - Ziggy... It fits! Not. Well, Stephanie? Wow! It perfectly fits! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! - Stephanie! It was you! Did you two poison everyone together? No! That isn't good enough, girls! - No... Now you both have to go to jail! But- - No, no. It is against the law. This is tragic. - Yes, this is tragic. So tragic... What a situation this is, Mayor Meanswell. - Yes, what a situation indeed. Officer- Officer! You are eating poisoned fruit! What a day this has been. I will talk to Richy Rich tomorrow morning. He will help us out of this mess. But now, I am going to rest a little bit. I am completely... Stephanie. Stephanie! What? I didn't know that you were bad. It wasn't me. I have never done anything bad and now I have to sit in here because of you. - Because of me? - Yes. Sometimes you do bad things. Do not! For example, do you remember when you cut the mayor's suspenders and his pants fell down? Yes. Or when you painted Ziggy's windows black and he thought it was night and slept for three whole days? Yes. Yes, I sometimes do pranks. See? But not like this. I've never come anywhere near this. I am always blamed for everything. Trixie? - Yeah? Are you crying? No! My eyes are just sweating a little bit. I am always blamed for everything. I didn't do this. I believe you. No, you don't believe me at all. I do. There, there. But if it wasn't you and it wasn't me, then who was it? I don't know! But I am going to find out. Remember, Sportacus said that you should never give up. Shhh! I am going to find out myself who the culprit is. Trixie. - Yeah? Let's find out together. Together? Yes, let's be friends. Wow, you want to be my friend? But nobody wants to be my friend... Right, but... ...then you can't prank me. Stephanie! I would never prank my best friend! There is just one problem... - What? We need the key! - I know! Stephanie! Yes, Bessie dear, calm down, I am bringing a full basket of fruit. Yes... No they... No, they are not poisoned... No, they are not poisoned... No, they are not... Shhh! When I am feeling tired When the whole world is against me The only thing that comforts me Is just knowing that you are here You are never alone Even if something happens to you You are never alone Because you have me And because you have me You have a good friend When most people are Grumpy and angry at the world I often get into trouble But I know that you will save me I am never alone Even if something happens to me I am never alone Because I have you And because I have you I have a good friend I am never alone Even if something happens to me I am never alone Because I have you And because I have you I have a good friend Yes I have you I have such a great friend Stephanie, let's go! I think someone is waking up! Let's go this way! Yeah! Come on! I must have become drowsy and fell asleep, yes. Well, my dear troubled girls... ...I do have to help you out of this... ...but now, I must fill in for Officer Obtuse, as he is very sick at home. But what was Officer Obtuse supposed to do today? Let's see... Yes, he was supposed to do some polishing. Then I must go do some polishing. Even though I've never polished before, I'm sure I'll be able to figure it out. Bessie, dear. - Yes? I have to do some polishing for Officer Obtuse. What? Are you polishing the car? Huh? Yes. Officer Obtuse is very sick at home. What? What illness is going around town? Huh? Richy Rich, thank you for your help. I don't know what we would do without you. Sure. I am going to see the president. Give him my regards. Mayor! Mayor! All of the food from the store has been stolen! There is theft and illness in the town. - I know! It seems that I can't handle anything here these days! Mister Mayor, I demand a town meeting right now! Okay, I will call for one. Town- No, no, no, no, no. I will call for a town meeting, Bessie my dear. - Okay. Town meeting! Everyone come to a town meeting right now. What? - Yes, Bessie wants a town meeting. Good people, welcome to this abrupt meeting where only one matter is on the agenda. It is not pleasant, I must say, but there has been constant pressure on me, as foreman of the Women's Association to... ...demand that the mayor resigns! What?! What makes him so bad? Hasn't he done great things? Are you so quick to forget? What happened to the home delivery of candy? Hasn't that been stopped? Yes, I was supposed to just walk all the way to the grocery store. Yes, and now he has poisoned us all. No, look, I have not poisoned anybody at all. No, even if you didn't spray it yourself, you are fully responsible for the act. You are supposed to be mayor, but you are nothing other than a coward. Yeah, a coward! Yeah! I remember when you told us to put the trash in the trash cans... ...instead of just throwing it on the street! Stingy, trash should be put in the trash cans! And there is never anything available in the store! And too few video rentals! Exactly. And too many sports festivals! Ziggy, the town's honor needs to be upheld. The town's honor? There is no honor in living in a town where the mayor takes part in poisoning the residents. Look, I have been the mayor here for... ...many years! - Yeah... ...way too long! And who is supposed to be the mayor then, may I ask? Huh? I have a particular individual in mind. Already? - Yes. Richy Rich, of course! Yeah, Richy Rich! - Of course! May he live long! Hooray! - No... ...I don't have time for this sort of nonsense. Please! All right! I will be the mayor! I will make sure that we feel good here in LazyTown. And I am going to start by letting the grocery store and video store be open all day and all night! Can we also throw away our toothbrushes? Yes! You will have nothing to do with such things! Yes, yes, yes... Only do what you think is fun! Richy is the best! Yes, yes, I want to thank you for your support. No, wait! Get out of the way! Go away! Bravo! Richy! Get! Get! - Richy is the best! Richy is the best! What a mess... You should treat your town with respect. Where are you Sportacus My loyal hero Sportacus, where are you Where are you Sportacus? I need your help. Yes, now my machine is ready and nothing is left to do but turn it on. Yes, yes, yes. And I do that by pressing this button here. It purrs like a cat. And then, we put all of the ingredients in the machine: a little sugar so everyone has energy... ...then a little food coloring, then all of it looks much, much better. Yes! And then, preservatives so the food will last forever. There, yes! And then we mix the ingredients together... Oops-a-daisy! ...by pulling this lever here. Wow... And then you pull this key here... ...and the fun comes out all ready! Smart Snack: Richy Rich's masterpiece! Wow, it's mega-exciting to be going to work for Richy Rich. Totally! Do you think we will be paid well? - Yes! I don't care, as long as it's possible to get candy home-delivered all day and all night! Why do you think he wants us here this early? - Don't know. One moment! Come in! Ta-da! Ta-da! - Wow, this is an amazing machine. This is Richy Rich's masterpiece! There, help, help. What should we do? - Ziggy... ...you are the button pusher. Pixel, you will oversee the mixing. Jives, you're the lever man. By doing this, you are doing LazyTown a whole lot of good. You will be named as the men of the month here in LazyTown! Ziggy, you will be heroes! Wow, heroes! - Yeah! Just like Superman! Sure. Now stop playing around and get back to work! - Right! Richy! - Yes? What am I supposed to do? Ahh, Stingy! I have a special assignment for you. I completely forgot to tell you that you will get paid much more than the others. Yes, well, I will just pay you later. You have to make sure that nobody gets through that door, there, unless they have a special password that only me and you know. Remember now, this machine is yours and no one else can see it. Right. - Right! Keep working. Hey, Richy! Richy! - Yes? What is the password? The password? - Yes. Right! The password is... ...shu-bob shu-bob ob-bob-bob. Right then, back to work. Shu-bob shu-bob ob-bob-bob? Boys, you have to learn this with me. Shu-bob shu-bob ob-bob-bob. Yeah! Shu-bob shu-bob ob-bob-bob is the password Shu-bob shu-bob ob-bob-bob is my word I am as tough as a rock Nobody will be getting in here Because in here, I own everything It's all mine Because in here, I own everything It's all mine Well, boys... Pixel, you have to take good care of my machine. A machine like this costs a lot of money, and you won't be able to pay for it if something happens. Nope! Less talking, more working! Each gear, belt, bolt and rail I'm even richer than Santa Claus Because in here I own everything I own it all It's all mine I own it all It's all mine I own it all! Bessie, dear! - Yes? There you are, honey. Honey?! Bessie, I am going to hire you as my private secretary. Your private secretary? - Yep! Yes, but Richy, what am I supposed to wear? That doesn't- Bessie, Bessie dear... Yes, just wear that one, yes, or that one. Yes, or that one- Just be in the office in ten minutes... ...sweety. Sweety? Wow! I had better see how it's going. Boys, open the door! It's me! Who is it? Nobody is allowed in here! This is my gym and my machine! Stingy, this is exactly how you are supposed to watch the door! You are doing excellently! Now open the door, it is only me! What's the password? I don't remember! It was something, something, what was it... ...shuby... di-bobbity, something skeetily-bob something- I don't remember! Just open the door! How many U's did that have? I don't remember! Just open the door, or I will break it down! I'll just open it... Ah! Richy! Just so you know, there are five U's. Fine! - And you also forgot this! Stingy! Trixie? - Yeah? There's somebody in the gym! The gym? - Yeah! It's the boys! Stephanie! - Yes? Yes, yes, yes... Stephanie! - Trixie! What are you doing here?! I'll get you for this! Come here! Come here! I will get them! Run! Run! I am not going to hurt you! They are here somewhere, I know it. Where- You there, chicken! Where are they?! There. I am only going to give them some candy. We don't eat candy. Only fruits and vegetables. Who asked you? It's you! I'll get you! Good morning. - Good morning! - Good morning! We got away! Yeah! We lost him! - Yeah! Stephanie, do you think he will be back? I don't know. Do you think so? Do you hear something? Yes, I do hear something. I feel like there is someone behind us. Owie! I've got you! Owie! - Move! You're hurting us! - Owie! Move! Stay there! Stephanie, quick! What a bad smell that's coming out of the sewer! And it's thundering! Well then... How rude you are! Stay right there! I need to go to the bathroom... Sportacus! Sportacus, can you hear me?! He is the only one that can help me... Sportacus! Mayor? Mayor! What are you doing so far from home? It's a long story. Hmm? - Yes. Everyone in LazyTown has turned their back on me. Even Bessie! What? Listen, I will throw you down a ladder, and you can come up here and tell me the whole story. No, no! I don't like such things. I am a little afraid of heights. Oh, well... ...then I will just land the balloon in the town square, alright? No, no, not alright. Then the townsfolk will start to suspect something. Wait... ...is it really that bad? It's very bad. Do you have a disguise? A disguise? Yes! Yes! I have a costume that Bessie made for me. It got first prize last year. Put the costume on and we will meet in the town square! - Yes, I like it! I like it! - Good luck! See you! ...more energy portions? Yes, and for the lady as well? Yes, I like that! What are you saying? It tasted bad? No, no, no, no. Just mix more water in, yeah. You will get used to it right away. Sure, listen, just remember to send the money to Richy Rich. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, goodbye. Boys! There is so much demand for the food, that you have to keep working all night! And don't stop! Mister mayor! Yes, hello, Mister Postman. Yes, thank you for that. I have been waiting for the newspaper all day. I know, I'm sorry. - Sure. Oh no! There is a picture of the car in the paper! Postman! Excuse me! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop... ...I will deliver the mail for you, and the papers too, and you can just go home and relax. Oh, awesome! But don't forget to eat your food, and say hello to your wife from me. Sure! Great, I will tell her! - You do that! Bye bye! - Bye bye! See you! What are you looking at, salmonella? I am becoming the richest criminal in the whole world! Sportacus? Where is he? I was supposed to meet him here in the town square! Sportacus? Where are you? I am in the town square! Sportacus, where are you? Is the mayor here? - Yes, I am right here. Where? - Right here! The mayor should be here somewhere, but where? - Yes, here! Where? I can hear him! Have you seen Mayor Meanswell? - Yes, it's me! Don't you recognize me? Is that you? - Yes, it's me! I didn't recognize you in that costume! - No wonder! It's a great costume! - Shh! Shh! Don't let anybody hear you. No one can hear us. There is something very strange going on here. - Very strange. This place is supposed to be full of life. - Yeah... Listen, you can't let anybody see you. You should hide behind there and I will handle this. Right, you do that. No, wait, listen! - What? What? Mayor Meanswell, I need your help. Can you take care of the balloon for me? What for? It must not be blown away in the wind! - It won't be blown away with me in it. Right, good. I am on my way to see Bessie. Good luck! No! Sportacus, come back! I am afraid of heights! The balloon is being carried off! Yes, Richy, I am coming with the money. Wonderful! Yes, thank you, goodbye. Bessie, what are you selling? What am I selling? Well, energy portions, of course, sir. Energy portions? - Yeah. What why do the townsfolk need energy portions? If people eat fish, and meat, and fish oil, then they don't need any extra energy. Extra? These are not extra, these are the main course, man. H2O mixed with water! What, do people eat this powder all day? It's so useful and quick, sir. Powder over and over! Listen, you have to start paying attention, sir. Paying attention? There is something strange going on here. I am going to help this town! Well, we just don't need any help, because there have been some changes. In fact, we have a new mayor! Wait, where is the good old mayor? We, the town residents, just didn't want him any more. He had become so old and tired and- Bessie! - Yes? Stop talking and we will go save the town together, alright? Follow me! Wow! Sportacus! Sportacus. - Yes? I know, of course this doesn't matter but- - What? I thought it was a bit harsh, what he did, to trap Trixie and Stephanie like he did. What? I'm beginning to like you. Where did he trap them? Where? - Yes. - There! There! - Here? Hello? There is no one in there. Hello! There you are! Sportacus! - Yes! Come out! Wow! One, two and... Thank you for saving us! We can always rely on you! But, do you know what? What? There is a criminal here in LazyTown, and we are convinced that is is Richy Rich. I see! - What? Richy Rich? No, no, no, no, no. He is so wealthy! Yes! Yes! - No, no, no, no, no, no. We think that Richy Rich and Dan Can are the same person! - Trixie! Trixie! Trixie... - Yes? ...and Stephanie, aren't you supposed to be in jail? Jail?! Wait, Officer! What is going on here? Girls, behind me! Look what's in the paper! - What? The president's car has been stolen! This is exactly the same kind of car that Richy Rich has! That is the same car! Richy Rich is also Robbie Rotten! I see, so that is how it is! Are you going to help me now? Yes! Everyone ready? - Yeah! And let's go! - Yeah! Let's go! Help! Help! Open the door! Okay, what's the password? The password? - They don't need a password! We are locked inside! - We are prisoners! I want to go home! Help! S-O-S, is no one there? Nobody to rescue me? I will save them! One moment, Sportacus. This is a task for the policeman, Oliver Obtuse. Of course, Officer. You're strong. - Yep. Break down the door! One, two, and go! That didn't go well. - Nope. Let's try one more time with a longer running start. From here. Are you ready? - Yes. And Go! You can do it! And- Officer, that didn't really work. I'll try one more time. It's locked really tightly. No, Officer. Haven't you been eating sportscandy? I don't need it. Now, I only eat Richy Rich's energy portions. Feel. This will never work. We will never open the doors with muscles like these! Then what should we do? We will just have to make you stronger! - Yeah! Let's just do a few easy push-ups. Flipping around and even with one hand! No, let's just make it five push-ups and that will work. No, let's just make it one and a half and no more. That won't work. I will make you stronger. I'll help you. Ready? - Yes. And go! One... That is very good, Officer. One, and one more, and... ...two... I can't do any more. What, you can't do more? - No. He will never be able to do it. Officer, we have to make you stronger. Let's cheer him on! - Yeah! I will help too. Are you ready? - Go, go, Officer! Yes, and go. - Ready? And... One! - Go go Officer! Yes, that is very good. And then... - Go go Officer! Two! - Go go Officer! That's great, and then, three... - Go go Officer! ...and four... - Go go Officer! ...and... - Go go Officer! ...five! Yes! Great, Officer Obtuse! Huh! He did it! And then... Wow! Now you are strong. And Officer, now we will be able to break down the door. Get ready! One, two and go! What is going on here? We were saving the town's honor! Richy Rich forced us to work on this machine! This is fast food! This is only powder! - Yeah! This is not healthy food. Something isn't right here. Now, look. Look at this! Aha! With this goo, Robbie Rotten was going to make a lot of money. As I have told you many times, you should not believe in quick fixes. Make the effort, and then, usually, everything goes well. - Yeah! Sportacus! Robbie Rotten is coming! Kids, keep calm, keep calm. Officer, you hide behind the door. - Okay! And Jives, you catch him as soon as he comes in. And Ziggy, you get a rope and swing on him like Superman! Superman! And Pixel, pretend to be working on the machine. Stingy, act naturally. - Okay. Girls, you hide. - Okay! And Bessie... - Yes? ...tell me exactly when he is approaching the building. Okay! He's coming! Stingy, act natural! Well- Catch him! Robbie Rotten! I'll get him! - Yeah! Hello! Hello! Hello! Mommy! Hello! He is everywhere! Mommy! Mommy! Hello! Hello! Noooooo! Wow! Where did that come from? It came from up here! I completely forgot that Mayor Meanswell was up in the balloon! Mayor Meanswell! Mayor Meanswell, dear! Be careful up there in the sky! Oh dear, he is so afraid of heights. Should I shoot the balloon and pop it? No! Mayor Meanswell! - Yes? Just throw something down. - Yeah! I have this sandbag here... No! Throw down a rope or something! - Here's a rope! Then we can pull you down. - Be careful! Pull! Be careful, though. Pull! I was floating everywhere! It was horrible! Are you okay, Mayor Meanswell? - Yes, I am recovering. There you go. There you go! Oh, Bessie dear, my dearest. Mister Mayor! Mister Mayor! Mister Mayor, Richy Rich! I am not the mayor anymore. "A perfect town for me." What? Mister Mayor... - Yes? The latest news: - Oh? The president is coming to the sports festival! Then we can return the president's car! No! We can't do that! It's so dirty! Yes, Officer Obtuse will clean it thoroughly for us. No, wait! Listen... ...we will make Robbie Rotten clean it, and then make him polish it after. Yeah! No! Yes! Okay then... Please clean the exhaust pipe on the inside. Can I offer you a caramel, Ziggy? Ziggy, no! Yes! No! Sure enough, this is how the story went Just look at how easily a person can be fooled Even the greatest mess is surprisingly easy to fix But it's best to not to let such villains trick you All is well that ends well And in the end we all sing In the end we sing All is right in LazyTown Life is great in LazyTown All is right in LazyTown Life is great in LazyTown All is right in LazyTown Life is great in LazyTown All is right in LazyTown Life is great in LazyTown In LazyTown!
