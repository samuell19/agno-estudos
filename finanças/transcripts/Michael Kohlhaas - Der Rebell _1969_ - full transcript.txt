In the middle of the sixteenth century in Germany, there lived by the river Ulster a horse dealer by the name of Michael Kohlhaas. He was a schoolmaster's son, and until his thirtieth year, he was a respectable hard working man, who taught his children to be honest, God-fearing and industrious. In short, the world would have every reason to bless his memory. But his insistence on these virtues brought him into conflict with the authorities. And this resulted in rebellion, arson, and murder. Hey, you stupid idiot! What are you doing? -What's wrong? Who are you? Are you in charge here? This man nearly broke my horse's backs. I'm the new manager. I'm going to make the estate more efficient. Good. So anybody who uses the road pays for it. Right, how much? - Five crowns. Nice horses. Have you seen his pass? -What pass? Hey you! Stop! - Hold it. Where's your pass? What pass? I've just paid my toll. New regulation. Well, all I know is that you have to have one. We have to keep our eyes open. There's a lot of horse stealing going on. Where do I get this pass? From the authorities in Wittenberg. Good, that's where I'm going. I'll get one while I'm there. You can't go through without a pass. Is your master up there? Is the sun coming out? -Sun? Or will it keep raining? I need the shadow from the sun. My Lord. Michael Kohlhaas. -Ah, yes. This man hasn't got... -Your man says that... -My steward says. Yes. He had no pass. -Well? Nobody's ever asked me for a pass before. - Things change. Cover it up, it's not going to shine. I'm sorry, if he says you need a pass. The market opens on Monday. If I'm late I won't get a good price for my horses. Well, unless you can help him... I'm afraid you'll be selling at a loss. We all have our problems. I can't use my machine. They tell me all this rain is ruining my harvest. We could let him through if he left something behind as security. Then he can pick it up when he comes back with the pass. All right. A horse? But I need to sell my horses. Two horses to be safe. I'll leave you to finish this. We're leaving two horses. This one. Hands off! Shut up! And this one. They're the best in the pack! I'll be back in two weeks. I don't trust 'em. I'd better stay here. My man wants to stay here. Why? - To look after them. All right, he can stay. But I don't like people hanging around. Here, pay them for your food. He's four years old. -I can see that. Here's a horse for sale. What am I offered? Please, can you give me some information? About passes for moving horses. That is the law. You sold the other horses? -Yes. How is business? So-so, prices go up and down. Well, goodbye. - Thank you. Where's my groom? My horses? Hans! Hans! Hans! Incredible. They're nearly dead. Where's my groom? Oh, mean the old man? Has he been back? Isn't he here? He picked a row with my men. We haven't seen him since. He got the worst of it. Why bother with him anyway? He's a half-wit and a liar! My Lord. I came for my horses. What horses? The ones I left behind. They've been used. We all have to work for our living. If you're going to work them, why don't you feed them? Did you leave money for food? -Yes, of course. So, you need horses but you don't want to pay for them. No pass is required for that road. I say who needs a pass on my land. The Magistrates in Wittenberg say you don't! Perhaps a misunderstanding with your Steward. I can't even find my groom. -What's your name? Kohlhaas. Kohlhaas, get off my land. And get your animals off. I'm leaving them here. You feed them and send them back to me when they're ready to walk again. Where's Hans? In bed. Allready? -Yes. Hans, you're stupid. You're too old to start fighting. If there was trouble you should have waited 'til I got back. Hh! Have you seen what they did to the horses? -Yes. Putting them in a pigsty and then working them to death. I went and complained to the Steward about it, and he set the dogs onto me. Are you sure you didn't do something to provoke them? You can tell me, I understand. Well, maybe you didn't like it there and tried to take the horses away? No! Wouldn't I have taken my saddle and the money that you trusted with me? The bastards tricked us. We should burn the place down with them inside. Take him some wine. -Very well. You did very well. Will he be all right? He's much better already. He was delirious when he came back. Did he tell you about the horses? Don't worry, I'll look after them. They'll soon be all right. I didn't bring them back. They could hardly walk. You mean, you left them there? Are the children asleep? Yes. Hey ho! Hey ho! Hey ho! Come on, give me that, darling. Come on, you can play tomorrow. They were standing there in mud and swill. We treat our pigs better. Their hooves were rotting. Sshhh! I know. -You don't. But surely Von Tronka isn't keeping his horses? He says he can have them each whenever he wants. The point is, Von Tronka had no right to take them in the first place. Yes. You mustn't interrupt your lawyer. He's perfectly capable of handling your case. Don't worry, it'll be all right. He doesn't seem to understand. We'll make him. Anyway, you can afford to lose two horses. What is your objection to taking back the horses, eh? I won't have them back in that state. My client thinks they should be returned to him in the condition they were in, when he left them at the castle. How can the court possibly know what their condition was then? Did he weigh them before he left them? He's ruined them, anyone can see that. I have asked you not to interrupt. I'm sorry. I quite understand your concern. There is also, the further question of the behavior of the groom. - Hans. Oh yes. You see, there is a counter allegation that the groom tried to remove the horses without the authority of the Junker. And that the Junker, therefore, was in the right in using force to restrain them. But, as my client states in his affidavit, the groom intended to feed the horses and not remove them. But as against that, the counter allegation is supported by the evidence of the Steward, and several other witnesses. However, whatever the reliability or otherwise of these witnesses, I don't see that the counter allegation challenges your client's main point. If I understand you correctly, your horses have been neglected in some measure, and as a result their condition has deteriorated? Yes. But now, we are back at our original difficulty. How to establish reliably, and independently, what their original condition was. I wouldn't be taking two wrecks to sell at market! Very well. We will make further inquiries and try to establish what their condition was and how they were treated. And does that mean I get them back in a decent condition? Yes... yes. We will look into it. Give them to him. No! Leave them. The Court has completed its investigations and ordered me to return the horses to you. Pronouncement of the Court of Wittenberg in the matter of the property of Michael Kohlhaas. The Court, having completed its investigations into the complainant's allegations, is of the opinion: One, that the Junker, Von Tronka, has in good faith offered to return the horses in question to the complainant. Two, that the complainant has willfully refused to accept this offer. Three, that the complainant has deliberately and maliciously used this dispute to provoke agitation on the estate of the Junker, Von Tronka.' I've what? Four, that this complainant has further refused to...' Get off my land! Leave them here. Here, take them! Hah! Yah! Yah! I want horses, not skeletons! A stone. He threw a stone. - Up to bed with you. Mummy'll come and say goodnight to you. Elizabeth,... I want you to go away with the children. Tomorrow if possible. You can go to your father's house. My father's house? What for? Only for a few days. I'm going to be busy. I'm going to get the horses back. But you just sent them away. -Yes, I know. I can't leave you on your own. I won't know what you'll be doing. I'm going to sell the house, and the land. What do you mean? We're going away. To my parents? No, no. I don't know. Somewhere. Anywhere. As far away from here as possible. You're mad! I'm just as upset as you are. You should try something else. Go to Dresden. See the Elector. Write a petition. I don't know. There must be a way. It will be just the same as here. The same kind of Magistrates, the same kind of Lawyers. They never listen. I can't go on living in a country where I'm not protected by my rights. You're being stubborn. I'm not being stubborn. I'm being sensible. All I'm asking for the moment, is that you go away with the children. I'm not going. I'm telling you to go! No. You're my wife and I'm... - No! Goodnight. - Night. It's getting chilly. You don't have to go away Elizabeth. We're staying here. I can afford to lose two horses. I'll soon forget about it. You know you can't. Can I ask you a favor? Let me go to Dresden. I haven't seen my friends for a long time. I'm sure they'll be able to help you. They know the right people at Court. No. That won't be necessary now. No matter what you say, you'll never be satisfied 'til you've punished. I'm satisfied. I love you. Where's Elizabeth? What is it? Your wife's gone. She went to Dresden. You should have stopped her! Have you got a stick? You'll need a stick. I thought we were going to the hall. Please take this one. I told the lady, you'll need a stick, I said. Her family wasn't in Dresden. She went herself. She kept saying, take me home. I wanted to take her to the hospital. Mama! Mama! I told you they'd be back today. Mummy! Mummy! Mama! Mama! Mummy! Wake up! No! No, inside the house. No, no, no. It's too cold to play outside. Hans, take them inside and don't let them out. Put me down. Mama! Can I help? Go away! Elizabeth... Give me that. He's mad. Where did he get all this nonsense about a pass? You don't need one on this road. He misunderstood us. He was in such a state, he wouldn't listen, just kept shouting. And I have to keep an eye out for horse thieves. On this road? Well... He had no right to leave his horses here and expect you to look after them and feed them. I give you three days to return my horses to my stable and to feed them and clean them with your own hands, so that they are in proper condition. Otherwise, I shall use whatever force is necessary, bla, bla, bla... Signed Michael Kohlhaas. Where's Tronka? Tronka! Tronka! Hans, get the horses, the stables are on fire! They can wait. Let's get the Steward first. They're not here anymore. Get the horses out of there! Get them out! Let me go! It was Von Tronka! He ordered me to! Von Tronka's gone. He's gone down the river. Let's go and get him. Hey you! Wait! Wait for us! What do you want? We want to come with you. Why? To join you. Who are you? -We're students from Wittenberg. Schoolboys. What's that? I got it from the castle. That's all that was left. Can we come with you? You can do what you want. But not for this. I saw you at the castle. Yes, Von Tronka's my uncle. Fear God and do no evil, Michael Kohlhaas. Where's Von Tronka? He's been dressed up like a nun. He... he's gone. He's gone to Wittenberg. To Wittenberg? Stop. Go home now or you'll never go home. Go home now! Come and open the door. It's Michael Kohlhaas! They won't open up. Your reputation has proceeded you. They're scared to death. Who are you? Ex-seventeenth Cavalry Regiment. Temporarily retired from the Army. I've got the strong box, too. Touch him. Touch him. Bless the children, Michael. God bless you... And may the Archangel Michael bless us all. Hey, little mother, we need to be blessed, too. God bless you. God bless you all. What were you studying? Law. What did you learn? - Learn? Thou shalt not steal unless you are in trade. Thou shalt not murder unless you're a soldier. Thou shalt not bear false witness, unless you're a judge. And thou shalt not commit adultery unless you incur a vast profit. D'you get a degree for that? Help yourself. Here's some bread for you and your men. Thank you. You cut it. You are the man to show them. Here. Are there many soldiers in Wittenberg? Only priests and professors. Will you burn it down? No. Then you won't get Von Tronka. I will. Get me something to write on. Let's leave our autograph. Let me pay you. No, no, no. Manifest: I, Michael Kohlhaas, demand that the citizens of Wittenberg, surrender the Junker Wenzel Von Tronka to me by noon today. Otherwise, I shall use whatever force... -Whatever force is necessary. That's what he said last time. Good morning. - He meant it. It's a beautiful day. Are there any more of these? -Who can say? Well, go and find out. Oh, but your honor, I... -I don't want the whole city on my doorstep. But that's not all. They've desecrated Town Hall. Get down there! What are you going to do? Have breakfast. Come and join me. It'll be interesting to see how Kohlhaas gets himself out of this mess. They won't send you Von Tronka out just like that. We're sitting here and he's getting away. I come from, I don't know where. I'm going to, I don't know what. Why don't you go and get him? Perhaps he couldn't read Kohlhaas' writing. You go... give him a big smile. Now I'm here... -I bet he'd like you. ...don't know why. -Write him a letter. Dear Uncle Von Tronka. What am I so proud of? -I'm here with a band of outlaws. Get inside, hurry! Someone's coming! Well? Nothing. Get the horses out of the open. They can be seen for miles. There's nothing to eat either. Try the other direction. Go into the villages and see if you can find anybody from Wittenberg. They must give us an answer. We'll come with you. Now look at that. Hey! Come over here! Mind the long grass, it tickles. What do you do with those legs when you're not walking? They want us to chase them. Come on! Hah! One... two... ...three! I'm having the blond one! You'll have to wait, there are only two. There's one of them! Stop him! - Over there! -Stop him! -Get him! Where's Kohlhaas? He doesn't know. -I don't know. Has he been here? - No. How d'you know? What? -What? -Where did he go to? He doesn't know. Do you? He doesn't know anything. He's the village idiot. Shall we let him go? No. He was up to something. Get a rope! Any last words? Any message I can deliver to Kohlhaas for you? Mount your horses, let's go. Nobody else here. The Troopers are snooping around. Yes, I know they've been here. Where are they now? Over there. Who's that? They've been following us all the way down here. The one with the feathers wants to meet you. Are we going to join up with those criminals? Get the powder barrels! Wait! Leave him to me! Hey! Hey! Congratulations, that went very well. We should go on working together. Bring everything over here. Stop that! I want them left as they are. Put them in the cart. They're entitled to their loot. Is that why you want us to work together? It pays to have friends around you when you need them. And think of the pickings we could make. All I want is Von Tronka. You won't get rich on that. But it's no use pointing out South to a blind man. How many more troops do we have? Sir... sir... there's a delegation here. Well? Sir, the Junker Von Tronka is putting us all in danger. Our wives, our children and our... -We have families! There were more notices hung last night. I know. He sent me a personal copy. - How can his men go in and out of town when they like? Aren't there any guards? - He burnt a house down last night. And now he says he's going to burn the whole town if you don't, uh... If I don't what? I don't say, er, uh, we should give him Tronka. Go on! What's the matter? Why did you run away from your university? I wish I had a classical education. Latin, Greek, astrology, theology. That's what gives you style. What's wrong with him? Nothing. He enjoys worrying. He won't be happy 'til he's got his Von Tronka. At home they'd be pressing the cider already. I could do with a glass. I hope that someone remembers to pick my apples. Get me a rope. You rob the peasants. Steal their horses and kill their sons. Rape their daughters. Castrate him! -Silence. Silence while the court speaks. The day of judgment has arrived, my boy, and you can't buy the magistrate here. We've got Tronka. Come and see Von Tronka. Did you bring the horses with you? Come up here! Disappointed? That's what you need. Not Von Tronka. Give him a seat. Or would you like to sit on her lap? Michael, you'll have to forget Von Tronka. They'll never give him up to you. And you can't fight the whole world. What would you do to him anyhow? Cut his head off? Drink his blood? Roast his loins? The peasants are coming up from the villages. They want to burn Wittenberg. And the students have rioted. And the university's been closed. Made a lot of new friends over night. Some people seem to like him. There'll be no one down in the villages. Let's go and help ourselves. No. No more small pickings. We're enough to raid whole towns now. They'll all work for us. Revolution is good for business. He's going to start the Golden Age. We support the same cause now. We're all friends. I'm from the Mayor of Wittenberg. I have some important news for Kohlhaas. You're from Wittenberg? Yes. Von Tronka's been sent away. He's left the city. That's a lie. We know he's still there. This time we're not going to ask you to send him. We're coming to get him. Hold him! Raise your hands! We swear that we will drive all those people that call themselves Mayors and Magistrates out of the city of Wittenberg. And any city or town that harbors these criminals, we'll burn to the ground. Where's Von Tronka? Tronka! Gimme that. Where's Hans? No. I can't send troops every time some provincial mayor gets the wind up about a half-size bandit. Let them deal with it on the spot. Unfortunately, they never do. We must send troops. Troops. To make an example of him. Immediately. What's this? Very well, Your Majesty. Do you know how many troops it would take, Field Marshal? He'd just go up into the hills. When the army left, he'd come out again. I need all my troops for my war in Poland. May I offer a suggestion? Has he a family? Only children. The wife must be dead. Yes? Perhaps we shouldn't treat him as a criminal. And if his horses were taken from him, the local Magistrate should have had them returned. And as they didn't, was he so wrong to take? I suggest that Your Majesty offers him a safe conduct to come here to Dresden and have his case reopened. -Good. At least he would be nearby and then... but he won't come. I believe he is an honest man and will come, if we act honestly with him. We must promise that if he's proved right he'll get his horses back. And be pardoned. Would you pardon a... a heretic? A gesture like this would be another example of the mercy and justice we have all come to expect from Your Majesty. And your troops would still be free to fight in Poland. Hey, hey, careful. Oh, come and sit down. Help yourself. Pour him a drink. Pity about the wind... Aaah! - Oooh. Pity about the wind. It spread the fire too fast. It hurts me to see all those beautiful things going up in smoke. What a waste. Why is Stern going? I don't know. I always say, get the women first. The loot stays here. The women run away. Don't you like running after them? - Don't worry about Von Tronka. We'll get him for you. My men will flush him out. Did you get anything last night? Of course. She was waiting for me. In the pillory. In the stocks? It's true! She was all spread out. With her arms wide open. That's what I call service. Oh, I've never had it that way before. Did I ever tell about the time I had it on a horse? Facing backwards and riding down a mountainside. You raped that woman? Yes. Had to be a rush job, the bed was on fire. You raped that woman in chains? That's right. Hang him! Why? He's my man, not yours. You... you. Keep calm. Look, I believe in law and order as much as anyone, but what harm has he done? It's not the first time she gave pleasure. Over there! Anywhere! Now! - Bastards! All right. But do it quickly. I don't want the whole place in an uproar. I do. I want them all to know. Do something! Stop him! No! Kohlhaas, you bastard! The view is beautiful. -It is indeed. You'd better leave me alone. Give us a sign if you need our support. I'm here on the instructions of the Elector. I see. He says you're a dangerous criminal. And you're certainly an impatient man. The Elector wants to help you. The Elector wasn't there when they took my horses. Wouldn't it have been better for everyone, these people, your children and your wife, if you had taken your horses, whatever their condition was, and stayed quietly at home? It might have been better. It might not. You didn't come here to ask me that. The Elector is willing to order a full investigation into the circumstances in which you lost your horses. And if they were as you've alleged, you will be given a complete pardon. And will I get them back? If they were taken from you illegally. In a decent condition? That's been made clear. And the others? If they go home quietly, nothing will happen to them. What does the Elector want from me? You must stop fighting and send these people home. The Elector invites you to return with me to Dresden. You will be given a safe conduct, of course. The Elector keeps his word. I want to take communion. Do you ask forgiveness for your crimes? For my sins. Do you forgive those who have sinned against you? Yes. Except Von Tronka. The Lord forgave all his enemies. Not all. Will you accept the Elector's offer? Why are you talking to them? It's not natural if they come here like this. It's dangerous. Hey, are you listening? I wouldn't trust them. They didn't drink the water I offered them. Boom! The Elector of Brandenburg... The Prince Anuncio. Michael Kohlhaas. Yes? His Majesty the Elector has asked me to speak to you. He is taking a personal interest in your case. Would you like some refreshment? That's Count Kalheim over there. That's Prince von Meissen. General Otto Von Gorgas. All your weapons have been sent to the armory at Wittenberg? And the plunder has been sent to the Elector's Treasury? Yes. And your men, have been sent home? Yes. Then I don't see any difficulty about your case. Ah! Your children. Papa! Papa... Papa! Have you some money to live on? Yes. Have we arranged accommodation for him and his children? Good. All this will take little time. We still have to find your horses. They seem to have been lost. In the meantime, we'll have to give you a guard. Why? For your own safety. You must realize you upset a lot of people in Dresden. Do you think he really needs a guard? You don't, or... - That's all right. Hold me. You don't have to carry me. There doesn't seem to be anyone following me. You should take the day off. Orders are orders. There are the horses. Two of them. I found them today. Well? No, I don't think these can be the ones. Where did you pick this fellow up? -In the slaughter house. He's a knacker. Ahem! Where did you get them? Bought them. Who from? An old farmer. Where did he get them from? Didn't ask. We've got a little problem here. You can probably solve it for us. I'm not sure if these poor horses are... I let my Steward deal with everything. These are my horses. All right, we'll buy them. Now... how much did you give for them? I'm asking four crowns. There's the glue and the leather and the bones. I'll give you one crown. - Four crowns. All right. And there's the wasted morning and compensation. -Compensation for what? Loss of business. Eight crowns. Get rid of this rabble. Give him four. - Nine. I added up wrong. - Four! Hey you, where do you think you're going? - Breakfast. Untie those horses! Untie those horses! I warn you, I am acting on behalf of the Elector! Get those horses! Kohlhaas! Pick it up! They had another riot in Dresden. Will they cut his head off now? No, he didn't start it. What's the difference? They'll get him some way. Er, he's finished. I wonder if he knows it yet. Where's he going? Back to school? They're coming! They're coming! Let's go to work. So you're leaving us? Yes. Where're you going? Goodbye. There's nothing! Nothing here worth taking. Where are you going? Who are you? Michael Kohlhaas. Michael Kohlhaas? I want you to guard all the exits. I don't want anyone to get out of here. Here, you catch it. Time to go to bed. It's late, come on. No, no, let me go. Let me go. Let me go. All right, all right. Down you come. Whheee! Bed time. It's getting late. Come along now. Right, get ready for bed. Come on, get to sleep. You take them back to the country. -Yes, sir. Wait a moment. Captain! Captain! You want to go out? Yes, I want to go for a walk. Wait, please. Send me four men! We're increasing your guard. There's a maniac running around attacking villages, calling himself Kohlhaas. One of your old comrades, no doubt. We have to take precautions. I'm going for a walk. I don't need soldiers. It's a bit late. So I'm a prisoner? No, no. Not a prisoner. What do you want? I want to come in. This is a prison. Yes, I know. The officer isn't here tonight. Call him. Tell him I'm Michael Kohlhaas and I want to come in. If I'm a prisoner, they must treat me like one and let the people see. The officer only comes in the morning. All right... I'll wait here. The Poles have crossed the river here. Prince Von Meissen is moving his men along the Oder. But that town is fortified. Stand aside! -Am I Chancellor or not? Kohlhaas is creating another disturbance. So are you. What is he doing this time? Sitting outside the prison. He wants to be put inside. Why doesn't the cavalry drive through and move your front to Blanan? Have you put him inside? - No. Then go and do it. There is a crowd watching him. This is not cavalry country. Why let them maneuver you here? It's all forest. Break up the crowd. Chase them home. Yes... yes. You should eliminate this man by military force. These disturbances are getting out of hand. I never break my word. You'll give him his trial? Yes. What is it? They've cut the bridge at Pozlitch. When I was a young officer, I remember I fought a campaign right here. There was a very good fort at Gdynia. Put Kohlhaas on trial. On what charges? Sedition, rebellion, breach of peace. Ask my councilors. Your Majesty promised him that he would not be prosecuted. Situations change. If you use the Gdynia fort you can push your front to join up with the cavalry right here... and squeeze the Poles at Nansk. Then what will they do? Disappear up their own bungs? And it's always peaceful citizens who suffer. Not these fanatics. - Exactly. Let him have his trial. Here. Now you're inside. I bet you wish you were outside. Michael Kohlhaas? You have asked for justice, and we are bound by the laws of the State to see that you are given justice. The horses taken from you have been fed and groomed by the Junker Von Tronka, and we return them to you now. Justice is our prerogative and can only be got through our hands. And our hands are always open to those who need us. But this protection must be asked for in our court and not demanded with the sword. Anyone who seeks justice outside the laws of the State is a rebel. You were pardoned for that and brought to Dresden after you had given your word that you would disband and keep the peace. Instead, your associates have continued to bear arms, using your name. And you have provoked riots and broken the peace. The punishment for that is death. Are the horses still my property? Yes.
