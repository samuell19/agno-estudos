And we are good. Tommy? Sounded good on my end and looked epic on my phone. All right. Good work everyone. Hey, sexy party people. I'm pretty sure we got it. Okay. As you can see, this is where it supposedly happened based on the internet videos. We easily recreated the fake murder using a few props and a couple of cell phones. So, for those of you suckers who believed the internet videos about the shadow people... You've been hoaxed! - You've been hoaxed. - And we are good. Scott, can you get that through the edit and upload it before we take off tomorrow? Yeah, with absolutely no sleep, maybe. - Is that a yes? - Yeah, man. All right. Hey, uh, Grant, Tommy and I wanna head to the camp now. Can we roll out now or what? Are you guys going ghoul hunting? That would be a big no. Please? Our guide really wanted us all to go at the same time. See. All right, fine. Just camp smart and meet us at the parking area tomorrow. Cool? - Coolio. - Camp smart? Oh. Hey, wait. You need your participation stickers. So dumb. Just give me your cards. Here you go, Connie. Right there. 500 bucks is a nice bonus if you get enough stickers. Yeah, it's just the gayest way ever of keeping track of team building moments. Then don't participate. - I already did. - And don't say gayest. We're at work. Can I say that we're having the gayest time of our lives? - Really? - No? No. Come on. - Hey, Rene. - Yeah, Abbs? You sure you really wanna go tonight? You'll be fine. We'll meet up tomorrow. Okay, just be safe. - Okay. - Okay. See ya. Remember, meet us at the parking area tomorrow. Okay, Daddy. Don't be a prick. Okay. Good work today, everybody. Remember, tomorrow, 1:00 p.m. sharp. Kyle. Oh, yeah... 3:00 p.m., you got it. Please. I don't mind you being here. Please, I'm so sorry. It is the company. No, please. You know, I now want you to know this is not your fault. No. No. No. 'Cause I look different, is there... No, I don't mind. I don't mind! Pug, I got you another one. Oh. You'll be fine. Get in bed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, I'm dropping this right here. Howdy doody? What can I do for ya? Sorry to bother you, but um, may I please speak to Don? We ain't leaving. I told the boys about y'all wantin' us to leave. They went way off the deep end. - Just mad. - Yeah. It's the land owner and the state. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Well, whoop-de-doo. And nighty night. - Ma'am... - Don't you touch me. There are men coming. Maybe tonight. I'm sorry. 'Course you're sorry. You're sorry for letting them evil people climb in our yard? And trying to take pictures of my family? Like my, my sons were freaks? You did nothing to stop that. I tried putting this off for months. It's the state that's getting serious. Oh. So, now we got to get gone, is that right? Is that right? Go on. Go on, say it. Is that right? Ma'am, I'm-I'm just trying to do my job. Just doing your job? Oh, you're such a smart young man. Ma'am, I'm just here to give you information... - I don't want your information. - And if you walk... I got this, hon. You could go back to bed. I took care of it. Go on in the house now, Mama. Go on. You're such a good boy. Women. You know how those people in town treat my boys. People out there in your world make us feel like garbage. Like monsters. Listen. That can devastate a fragile human being. Just ain't right, son. No sir, it's not. It's the only home we got. Don, they're coming. Well, maybe they shouldn't. What have they ever done for this county? With their drilling and fracking, make people sick, is all. I'll be waiting here, if they come. Thanks for looking out, Rico. You be careful out there, now. Hey, Don. Don. Don. This is super weird. She's fine. Don't worry about it. Come on. I thought we said 1:00 p.m. It's barely 1:30, bro. Rene isn't answering her phone. It's very unlikely that there's much, if any, cell service up there. Abbs, be more like me. Stoned? Oh, no, I was gonna say, expect nothing, anticipate everything. It's my motto. Lame. Why are we even here? Because your boss and mine wants to see more teamwork. I like this kind of work. Anything else, guys? No, we're good. Thank you. And you get to drink beer. So, enjoy it. True that, twisted sister. I'm so not looking forward to getting out there, and getting all dirty and bitten by bugs. I heard you like to get dirty. Hey, watch it. What's that guy staring at? Your boobs. - Nice, bro. - Shut up, Kyle. That's two. Don't let there be a third. What's up your ass today? You're at work. You need to remember that. Yeah, that's fair, all right. Can we help you? Hey. Going out? You a genius? Your gear kinda sucks. Okay, that was rude. Arrogance will get you killed out in the wilderness. That, or a weirdo local. - Are you kiddin'? - Okay. Hmm. Where you going? None of your business. Near Coon Creek, maybe Bear Mountain. Lot of accidents happen up there. Yeah. Well, we have a guide. Yeah. Well, people who live up there don't like tourists. I'm sure they don't. Hey, hands off, creeper. Scott, dude. Don't be a cockwaffle. So, a cockwaffle is like this meaty breakfast... Rene still isn't answering her phone. Trust me. She's fine. Get 'em gone. My patience is just about gone, Rico. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Well, I'm very, very sorry that a coyote ate your cat. The best I can do is put out some traps tomorrow. Yes. Yeah, yes, ma'am. All right. Good night, Mrs. Henderson. You guys are dicks. Now, I've already let the Maxwells know... If we have to remove 'em ourselves, they ain't gonna like it. As I was saying, we already asked the Maxwells to leave. Look, involve the sheriff if you guys want to. I have no authority on your company's property. It's your job to remove them before we took over the property, months ago. It's in the goddamn contract. We asked them to leave months ago. We don't need the sheriff's help to remove an old man and his wife. Back off, big guy. I need some coffee, if you ain't busy. - Go fuck yourself. - All right, back off, Carol. You too, Ug. They've lived there 30 years. This federal document trumps your empathy. We will remove them. Let's go. Holy shit. Am I right? I think I had poison ivy on my leg. If we find these people, dude, we win. Yeah. Do you even think that they're real? Plus, that video says they ate babies. Shut up. They don't eat babies. They could eat babies. How much further do we have to go? - Stop whining. - I'm not whining. It's work. Yeah, well, you could've stayed at the camp site. Yeah, I should've stayed at the camp site. Holy shit. What kind of asshole. Ah. Fuck. Ah. Can we be done already? Dude, the video said those people filmed them a few hundred yards up these trails. So, move. And Grant wants us back to camp before everyone gets there. Plus, I'm hungry. Get gone. What in the absolute... Shit. Take a picture. - Damn it. - Come on, get him. No way. No fucking way. I'm out. Don't be a pussy. Come on, Tommy. Please. I just think that he wanted us to go, you know? Come on, just 10 minutes. We'll ask him why he's afraid of us. I don't think you're reading him right. Hi. Rocks and Roots team building guide, Craig Eubanks. I'm sorry. I was a little late. My last group took forever getting back on the road. I'm not a part of your group. Oh. Hi, I'm Craig. Maybe we should get this started. If you could pass those around. Um, are you missing a few people? Well, you were the one who's late, so. Kinda could've slept in a while. You did sleep in. And, full disclosure. Two of our team went up to the camp site last night. Now, I'm pretty sure I said, no one was to go alone. Right? Yeah, you did. What? What do you want? I know you. - No. - Yeah. You let that girl drown a couple of years ago. No. No, I didn't. I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm the guy who knows. Yeah. I heard you just froze up. You just froze up and let her die. Not cool. - I agree. - Yeah, well... Guy who knows, I think you should be on your way. You have a good day, Manson. Oh, my God, how could you tell that freak where we're going? He's a stoner. No worries. Okay. This is your team building orientation. There's that motherfucker, right there, man. Time to get your ass out of our woods, you damn freak. Fuck's sake, turn around you stupid... Where's your hard headed daddy? We got something for him. Our home, my family, leave us alone. Get gone. We ain't no teenagers out here tryin' to find a boogeyman. We damn sure ain't afraid of you and your fucking skin condition and whatever shit you got yourself into. I heard I could get 300 bucks for a picture of his retarded baby brother. We're done talking. Do it. Hmm. Well, he's dead. He's dead. That's enough, you got him. You got him. - There's more of them, Apple. - Hmm? Oh, my God. No! Don't kill me. Thank you, Abby. You may sit down. Rocks and Roots. - Still team building, Craig? - Hey, Rico. How you doin'? Yeah, we're heading up to Whiskey Flats. Whiskey Flats? You know that's private property now, not national forest. We're going wherever those ghoul babies are. All right, Craig, you're not taking these people out to the Maxwells, are you? Yeah, yes, we're gonna find him and film. It's gonna be awesome. No, Rico, we're... we're not. All right, good. 'Cause I'm getting a lot of shit from the drillers. Don't want any shit from the Maxwells. Who are the Maxwells? Oh, he was a ranger, long time ago. He got fired and decided to stay on the land. He met his wife one night when she was lost. And I guess they fell in love. And she decided to stay behind. See, the problem is, all the oil drilling and fracking poisoned the water supply in that area. That's what the Maxwells drank. So, now, their kids, they have this skin pigment problem and sensitive eyes. Just strange looking, is all. So, so the rumors are true, though. They're like albino people. - No, no, they're just people. - You guys aren't serious, are you? No... Everybody, stop, listen. Just leave them alone, all right? There's enough rumors going around about the Maxwells. Don't bother them. Don't worry, Rico. We'll mind our own business. All right. Y'all be safe, all right? I'll be patrolling the area later on. Y'all need anything, wave me down. So, they are real. Yeah. Al right, all right, all right. We're not going on any privately owned land, right? - No, no, no. - Right? We're gonna be fine. Don't worry about Rico. We're gonna see some deformed ghoul babies, and I'm gonna tackle one of them, and it's... Hey! If you had some deformed brother or sister, would you want some asshole talking about them like that, trying to take their picture? No. You wouldn't. Did he just call me an asshole? Okay! The van is outside. Let's get up, grab your gear, and make your way to the van. Kill me! ♪ There's a knock at the door ♪ The Devil's on the other side ♪ The desperate vultures Waiting ♪ To feed on your dying hearts ♪ The serpent is depending ♪ On you to fall apart ♪ She left out the back door ♪ Holy shit! What the hell? What was that? There was someone in the woods. Someone was just standing in the woods. - See anything? - It was a guy. He was just standing there. Stop messing with us. I'm not, I swear. Was it a ghoul baby? Shut up, Kyle! How you doing over there? Mr. Apple? How you doing over there? Whoop! There you go. I've got some of your favorite cookies. Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah. Cookies. There's cookies. No. Ooh, there's... - One, two, three. - He said we go! One... Come on, one cookie. Those got your vitamins in 'em. One, two... That's got another vitamin in it. Here you go. Here you go. Oh, what a good boy. Go on, go on, chew it up. Oh, good boy. My God, I love you so much. I love you. I love you. I love you so much. They're never going to get us. No, no, Ma. So, you show it to them. Go away! Sit down in your mama's lap. What a big boy! Oh, what a big boy! I love you. Welcome to paradise. Now, get the fuck out. Why are you always so charming, Hank? All right, we're here a little bit later than planned, but it's not a big deal. We still have a ways to go. I really don't wanna go out there I swear I saw someone. Listen. There's absolutely nothing to worry about. Nothing. People camp and hike and fish and hunt all around these mountains. We may see more people. It is a wilderness area. It's no big deal. He didn't look right. Maybe you didn't look right to him. The stupid stories you guys are talking about got me all creeped out. Come on. There's six of us. We're safe as kittens. All right, hang on one minute, Hank. All right, everyone. All cell phones in the bag. Oh, fuck that. Yeah, what? No way. Yes, way. Look, you guys are here to connect, and learn self-reliance. That benefits the team. Um, nope. I came here to chase mythic albinos. This whole team-building shit, that's being forced on us. Careful, man, that's gonna get you in trouble with the sticker police. Phones! Grant, you wanna help me out here? Guys, just do it. Babe, come on. It's fine. No, it's not fine. Look, I've got this. In case of emergencies. What are you doing with our phones, then? They will be right here in this waterproof bag. All right. Let me pay Hank, and then we'll be on our way. All right, everybody sure they got everything? I'm missing my phone. I'll see you back here Sunday afternoon. I don't think I like him. I hate him. All righty, then. Here we go. You left our phones on that van, didn't you? Yup. Hey, Craig, are you a dick? Hey... Did he? I did. But we're covered. It's three days, people! Jesus! - Two, really. - It's just, I can't. Please don't hurt me. Where's Tommy? You know, uh, my brother and I used to play in here, these parts. Can you, can you believe that stuff like this used to give my brother and I such a comfort, make us feel normal? Because... you know, it's a human defect. Our problems lay a few centimeters deep, but, you know, they had no souls, as people saw it. Don't kill 'em, they're harmless. Please don't hurt me. Where's Tommy? My friends, they're coming. They'll find me. They'll find me. No, they won't. They will. No, they won't. No, no. No, no, no. No. No, please! Please! Please. Please! See? I'm not all that bad. Thank you for the wine, Craig. Nothing says class like cardboard vino. Yeah, well, it's easier to pack out than glass. Truth. Here's to a successful exercise tomorrow. Yo! So, uh, you heard anything from your friends? Well, you took our phones, so we wouldn't know, would we? Their car's here. I'm sure they found a good place to camp, and we'll catch up to them tomorrow. And on that note, we are going to bed. You guys try and get some rest. And seriously, all joking aside, you guys are a great team. I'm proud as hell to be your leader. Oh, jeez! All right, all right. You're a bunch of sarcastic assholes, is what you really are. But it's fun doing these exercises with you. So, cheers. Cheers. Don't mention it. What time are we taking off tomorrow? I think about 8:30. Should give everybody enough time to rise and shine and do your "business." At 8:30 in the morning? You know tomorrow's Saturday? And you're getting paid. Suck it up. So, Abbs, what do you think you saw? Dude, seriously, stop messing with her. I'm not screwing with her. I'm just kind of wondering. So, Ab-master? It was probably just a hunter or something. That's all it was, Abbey. Maybe a fisherman going back to camp, another hiker. Anyone, really. Okay. I am going to call it a night. Big day tomorrow. I suggest you guys do the same. Night, Craig. See you bright and squirrely. Dream happy thoughts. Fuck it. Might as well crash, not really anything else to do. Well? I'll pass. I'm probably paranoid enough already. - Night, guys. - Night. - You want a smoke? - You want a smoke? Yeah. So, what do you think about all that? Well... The YouTube thing said there was a cell phone found, and it had one of these albino people on it, or whatever you wanna call 'em. Like, internet rumors and bullshit. Yeah, pretty much. The story goes that, like, some asshole and his girlfriend found them by accident one night, and tried to film them. And, I guess... one of them falls in the river, and the other one was never found. So, instead of just saying that they got lost, these rumors spread that these mountain folk killed them. So, if they died or vanished or whatever, how the hell did the video get posted online? Exactly! It's bullshit. It's bullshit. Fuck off! Kyle! Stop throwing rocks at my tent! I'm over here with Peppy. It's not cool, guys. Seriously. Guys, come on! We're tired. Stop. Daddy's pissed. Hey, Abbey. You want some company? I'm fine. Just stop. I'm gonna go check on her. Good luck, I'm snoozing here. It's comfy. Except my little piggies are cold as fuck. Hey. Hey. Wear a rubber. Dude, I would be an orphan with a baby still if I can make that happen. This really isn't so bad. Really not bad at all. It's kinda like that Four Seasons in Bali, isn't it? You're such a jerk. Just with some extra bugs and... Remember you said we'd be glamping? This is not glamping. - This is glamping. - No, it's not. With three minions. You think is Abbey gonna make it? She's so scared. Scotty's looking a little frisky. Oh. What? Uh, I don't think that protein bar agreed with me. Oh, God! So romantic. Yeah, I gotta take a shit. - Okay. Just... - Yeah. Go away from our tent, then. Okay. I'll be right back. What? You like it! No! Goddamnit, Kyle! Knock it off! You all right? I'm fine. Do you want some company? Scott. What? I'm just asking. Just trying to look out for you. I don't need anybody looking out for me. I'm just saying, if... you're scared, I can sleep right here on the ground. Completely harmless. Smooth. I knew it. No. Forget it. I'm out. Wait, I... Will you just stay, but out here? All right, yeah. I'll grab my sleeping bag and be right back. - Thank you. - You bet. Fuck! Jesus. Lucky I already shit, or I would have. Near my tent? Dude, not cool. Buried it. Relax. I fucking smell it, man. You'll be fine. Fucking asshole! I am getting laid tonight. ♪ Laid tonight, laid tonight ♪ Hey, baby, what are you doing in my sleeping bag? Oh, my God! Oh, fuck! This is it, bud. Almost over. What the fuck? Inconsiderate douche-nozzle. You get to see the other side before I do. Yup. This is gonna make a good one. Kyle! Kyle! Wake up! Oh, shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Hey. Howdy, Ma'am. Didn't mean to wake you. Who are you? Hey. Hey! Hey! Kyle? Kyle? Kyle, wake up. Kyle, please wake up. I'm only... I'm really sorry. Fuck, man. - Ah. - Connie. What the fuck? No, Apple. Not the women. Apple! Oh. It's really beneath you. What'd you do? They're killing everyone. They, they just, they just killed them. Craig, what's going on? Those guys, the, the family, the white guys. They just killed everyone. They, they're killing everybody. Who? - The Maxwells? - I don't know. Yeah, yeah. They just killed my people. - Carol, come in. - Come on. Rico, we gotta get outta here, man. Carol, please pick up. Craig. Craig, where are they? They're behind you. Apple. Patton. Listen. I am going to try and find some cell service. - Craig. - You... Craig, stay there goddamn it. - I'll go for help. - Craig! Get down. We ain't leavin.' If you had any sense, you'd get gone. This didn't involve you. Didn't involve those people you killed, either. He knows them. Remember, I know your daddy. That don't mean you know me. Get on your knees. Please. Please. Please. All right. I guess, since you're so polite and all. Leave us alone! Rico, do you copy? Rico, come in. I was in the head. Is everything all right out there? Somebody help. Help! Wait. Can you please... - Mama. - Can you please help me? Please. Please. Please... - Are you all right? - No. - Come on. - We need to get inside. All right, come one. Come in the house. Now. Come on. Someone's been killed, Mama. I heard. Well, bring her inside. - Take her in the house. - Get her some tea. - Come on, come on. - Come on. You're safe, now. Go in. Come on. You're gonna be all right. There's two men. I know, come on in. Come on in. Come on in. We have to... Can you please call the cops? Come on in. Are you coming or are you gonna stay out? I'm comin', I'm comin'. I hope to God... You just sit tight and you drink your tea. Careful, it's hot. Get this around you. Stay nice and cozy. - There you go. - Thank you. That's a good girl. It's a landline. Cells don't work out here. Yeah, hi. Don Maxwell here. Out at the Hawk Boundary. The old Ranger cabin and pack station. No, I'm okay, yeah. It seems we have someone here who's lost. I'm not lost. Tell 'em about the killers. How many do you think? I don't know. Um, Kyle, maybe Connie. There were six in our group. Craig ran. Just please tell 'em to hurry, it's not safe. We're safe here. - We are. - Oh, yeah. Uh, she has some friends with her. Uh, I don't know who got out or not. Okay. Yeah. All right, thank you. Oh. They'll be here soon. They're on their way. All's well. Drink your tea. I'm, uh... I'm gonna go outside, wait for the Sheriff. Mama, make the girl another cup of tea. Looks like she can use it. All right. You like the tea? You're very pretty. So... Where are you from? - What? - Where do you live? Temecula. No, I've never been there. I've never been very many places, really. It's so beautiful here. Uh... The cities are a little bit suffocatin'. A lot of very hard people. Mean people. Mean and I mean mean. You know what I mean when I say mean. Did you lock the doors? Because I feel like you should lock the doors. It is so peaceful out here. Except when the strangers show up. I sure wouldn't understand why they wanna harass my family, but they do. Are they on the way? 'Cause, when I first came up, he said that... Damn flies. I... Goddamn flies. You know, once, the boys and me, we was trapped, in this very room and we could not escape the flies. We was unable to escape them flies. It had to do with a reoccurring fly problem in our barn. Apparently, the place was just filled with all these flies, and they just, they just found their way right into here. Don, he went out there, and he bug bombed. To kill the flies. But they just keep on coming. They just keep on... They keep on, they keep on, they just keep on coming. So... Yeah. You say you come up here with some of your friends? Ah, shit. Carol, come in. Carol? Fuck. Say what? I can't hear you in here. ♪ The eensy weensy spider ♪ Went up the water spout ♪ Down come the rain ♪ Washed the spider out ♪ Out came the sun ♪ And dried up all the rain ♪ And the eensy weensy spider ♪ Went up the spout again ♪ Look what I brought you. Little tea. We're gonna take good care of you. Ooh, my boy. He thinks you are so pretty. You are. Look at you. One sip? No. No. Ain't you Miss Smarty-pants? He didn't call anyone. No. No one's coming. Ah, shit. I think I gave her too much tea. Still good tea, Mama. But don't you worry, honey, because Patton's gonna give it to you. Yeah, he is. He is. He's the one. He gonna be all yours. He is the most beautiful one. You're gonna be so happy together. You're gonna give me some normal babies. Ain't ya, Patty? Plenty of 'em, Mama. You know how to do it? Absolutely. He's going to give you twins. We're gonna have a boy and a girl. Then we'll have another boy and a girl. Then we're gonna have two boys and two girls, and then we can have another set, and they're gonna be triplets. We're gonna have a big family. - Whole family. - Whole family. A big, beautiful, whole family. We love you. We need you. Sleep tighty night. - You, sir. - Thank you, Mama. Here we come, honey. Coming through. No one else just randomly gonna show up, are they? Shouldn't. Here you go. Put her... Tuck her in. Tuck her in. Just like a little baby. There you go. That's a good boy. So, where's Apple? I don't know. Of course not. - Son. - Yeah? Once you get her settled, you clean up you and your brother's mess. You hear me? I know. Pretty little thing, ain't she? I was your bride once. Prettiest little bride in the whole county. You better come to bed, Daddy. I'll be right in. I got something for ya. Don't be long. Get lost, Pug. Let go. This one's not yours. Oh, my God, Abbey? I'm gonna marry you. Oh, wake up. Please. Wake up. I'm here, Abbs. Wake up. You're okay. We're okay. Rico. What are you doing here this time of night, son? Little late for gardening, don't you think? Don, I'mma need you to back away from the... I'm gonna need you to back away from the door. You're gonna hit me with that hoe? You ain't a law man. Be cool. You're tresspassin'. It's not your land, Don. So, technically you're the one who's trespassing. Opinions vary. I got rights, too. You know? Where is the girl, Don? Damn, son. Looks like you met the wrong end of an ass beat. I ran into Patton. Where is she? Oh, we can talk about it in the house. I'm going back inside. Grab me a cold one. Stop. God damn it, Don. Stop. Turn around and answer me right now. Drillers. The drillers. They attacked my boys. I didn't know anything about it. Other people are dead, Don. I know. Apple... Apple heard some some people... coming to move us out. He thought they was them. It was an honest mistake. An honest mistake? An honest mistake? Don! Those were hikers. They were practically kids. And now they are dead and you... You made that happen. Let it go, Don. It wasn't up to me, Rico. If you create a beast, you best learn how to ride it. I'm too old and sick to give a damn, now. Now... I just want it all to be over. It is over - MAMA: Dad... I knew you were like the goddamn... You really don't wanna fuck with me tonight. Ms. Maxwell, just back off. I'm about to cut off more than that you motherfucker. Oh, God. Apple. You killed my baby. Yeah, well fuck your baby and fuck you, too. You chopped off my fingers. You ain't gettin' out of here. Help!

They got Tommy. Can we get out? I searched every inch of this place. That psychopath comes in and out of that door. There's no other way. Is it safe? I don't know, but... Abbey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, Abbey. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. If we stay here, we're going to die, okay? Don't wanna die. Me either. Okay, okay, so, breathe. We're gonna breathe. We have to go. Okay? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Wait. Wait. But what if he is out there? It doesn't matter. He's gonna come back, either way. Come on, Abbey. Come on. Don't, don't, don't, don't...

Obviously we wander around the neighborhood with my team of cameras that come out here to enjoy the beautiful and bucolic scenery of gorgeous Whiskey Flats, Oregon. Just had to say that I know you got a bad reputation in light of the recent incidents that happened. But I'm here to assure you that at Rocks and Roots, we are leading the industry in death and injury resistant camping trips. We have... well, you know, at Rocks and Roots, we boast one of the highest survival rates in the industry. So, when it became first apparent to me that my camp site was under some sort of terrorist attack, I assured everyone that the situation was under control and told them remain calm as I did myself. It's not like it happens often. I can't even remember the last time it happened. Yeah, no, I can't remember. If, by some act of God... Don't let our isolated incidents dissuade you from coming to visit Rocks and Roots. ♪ Things, things ♪ That make the world fall around your feet ♪ And I know that it's time ♪ For you to run, run, run... ♪ We are very proud to say that if you don't survive, you don't pay.
