A GDR - USSR Co-Production DE FA Babelsberg in Cooperation with Film Studios Sofia and Bosna Film Madrid End of the 18th Century Directed by Konrad Wolf or The Hard Road to Enlightenment Based on Lion Feuchtwanger Papa, take your cane! Well? Do you like it? Isn't 400 reales too much for a frock coat, Francisco? I am the court painter, after all. Will you see the queen and kiss heron the hand? Yes, my little daughter. And it will be a happy day for me. Well? How do I look? I can't hear anything. I think you look like the First Minister to the King and the First Lover to the Queen. You have the same taste as Godoy. You can't even paint a horse's ass. I'd rather paint horses' asses than your salacious women. - Agustin, don't be so insolent! - And what of the court painter? He preens like a peacock and puffs himself up like a turkey. Don Jose Alvarez DE Toledo 13th Duke of Benwick and Alba, 11th Marquis of Villafranca. Dona Cayetana, 13th Duchess of Alba. The ambassador to the King of France, His Excellency Monsigneur de Havre It's probably unpleasant to be a beheaded king's diplomat. Are you implying that other royal diplomats won't go through the same? For the first secretary of the Inquisition, those are some very - heretical thoughts. - The world is changing and ideas with it. "All is for the best, in the best of all possible worlds. " I see even inquisitors read Voltaire. One must be prudent, dear Madam. Don Francisco DE Goya y Lucientes, Court Painter His Excellency Don Antonio Ricardes, Lieutenant General of the Royal Arm}I, Governor and Captain Genera! Of the Catalonian Army Principal President of the Royal Jurisdiction. Francisco! We are truly glad to see you, dear friend. - How is your health these days? - My hearing has returned. Thank Heavens! I take it then my portrait will be finished soon? I hope. Maybe even this week! You've become successful. Big names?ock to you. But I advise you to be careful. Not everyone can stomach fame. I have a healthy stomach! I wouldn't be so sure A moment, my dear. Excuse us, please. Her Excellency the Marchesa San Carlos. This is unbearable for me, Dona Lucia. What do you mean? I cannot deny my thoughts and feelings forever, believe me. A good Catholic must deny them That might be true. Maybe I'm no longer a good Catholic. Such thoughts are very dangerous south of the Pyrenees, my friend. I know. What should I do? I hate the Inquisition and love you, Dona Lucia. Please speak of it no more! "One must always be prudent, don't you thin k?" It's you who said it Once Godoy has assumed the office of prime minister, you'll have to paint a few new portraits of him. I'll arrange a meeting with him for you, if that's alright. Thank you, Miguel. That'd be very kind of you. Godoy will change things politically. Excuse me for a moment. Why do you look at me that way? You have already painted me and know me. That portrait was a failure. I need to try it once more. Not for the time being. Maybe later. Maybe. Their Catholic Majesties and the prime minister Don Manuel Godoy Duke of Alcudia. You are ravishing, my dear! And always such unusual ideas. Why such a humble dress? Our Fatherland is still waging a holy war again st France. It is the duty of all Spaniards to limit their expenditures. Those are highly commendable thoughts, my dear. But your sacrifice has now happily become irrelevant. We recently decided to choose the simplicity of peace over the glory of war It is costing us too much blood and money. Now that Italian's now playing the merciful royal mother, because defeat is inevitable. Many will admire the wisdom of this royal decision. I'm of a different opinion. My Spaniards think likewise. Are you certain? My fellow countrymen will be very unhappy that you are now making peace with that godless Republic and ending the holy war without having honorably won it. It is not Spanish tradition. Hey! In what way, my dear? I hope you'll forgive me that my bluntness has not incurred Your Majesty's disapproval. If you'll permit an observation, Madam, your dress is gorgeous - Most likely from France? - No. From Italy. Your Fatherland has very skilled seamstresses. You are too kind. Truly too kind. We haven't seen each other for a while. How are things as always? Many thanks, Your Majesty. I am very satisfied. When will you paint us again, Don Francisco? It would be a great honor for me at anytime, Your Majesty. The estimable company is bidden to come to the auditorium. French actors will perform a drama by Berthelin for you. " "The Martyrdom of Marie Antoinette. " Cursed heavens! That's it, Don Francisco! The air, the light and the gray that only you can do. You don't know what you've done! In one night! - 600 reales for one night! - Brute! Drag it in the mud! Let it be. Looking at the horse's ass, by the way, - it's very good this time. - A noble brute, though. Really. My compliments. A truly beautiful ass. You've eamed yourself a glass of sherry. And I'll give you, as a just dessert a Girl! Thank you for your generosity. But today I'll take you out to my taverna. Today you can ask of me what you will, you failed student! I didn't know that she is depraved too, Pace. The old masters' clear lines are good. And clear things are therefore clearly expressed. But people aren't clear. The vicious, the dangerous the witch}; - that can't be painted with old methods This say I, Agustin Esteve, failed student and painter of horses' asses. And I'll also tell you In the black moon of the highwaymen, the spurs do sing. Little black horse, where are you taking your dead rider'? Where are you taking your dead rider? In the black moon, bled the mountainside of Sierra Morena. In the black moon, bled the mountainside of Sierra Morena. Little cold horse, what a scent of knife-blossom! What a scent of knife-blossom! Little black horse, where are you taking your dead rider? Where are you taking your dead rider'? - Long live Maria! - Viva! - Long live liberty! - Viva! - Long live Spain! - Viva! In the black moon, a shriek! And the long hom of the bonfire. In the black moon, a shriek! And the long hom of the bonfire. Little black horse, where are you taking your dead rider? Where are you taking your dead rider'? Who is that? Maria. Maria Rosario. Maria, this is Francisco DE Goya. Pleased to meet you, Don Francisco. Your song impressed me so much that I'd like to paint you. Paint me? But Sir Court Painter, I am just a singer. May I introduce you to my friends? Jose Quintana, poet. - Pleased to meet you. - Pablo Otero. Otero? Much has been said about him. So much that I had my doubts whether you existed. As you see, I still exist for now. - We have a request of you. - Who's All of us, whom you see here and others too. Are you familiar with this book? "Madrid has more churches than tenements, more priests and monks than church-goers. Ghosts of fear and cowardice, indolence and ignorance point their fingers at the small band of educated men. We fear the dungeons of the Inquisition; But we do not fear our own conscience. " "To see the world curse your name; Not knowing if your work will be performed or not; Depending less on applause than insults... do you know what this means? It means being a poet, artist or painter in Spain. " Who wrote that? Gaspar Melchior DE Jovellanos. The glow of Spain - and Spain's shame. Jovellanos was banished from Madrid many years ago, Sir Court Painter. Hmm, a "bread and bull" fight. And what do you want from me? Manuel Godoy will make peace with France. He'll be forced to lift certain measures against the liberals Esteve says you paint Godoy. You could advise to him to pardon Jovellanos before the Inquisition destroys him. I'm not amazed when our friend Bermudez utters such things. From you, it surprises me. It just occurred to me. Please forgive me. I'm always glad to listen to an honest opinion. I hear, by the way, that you have a new mistress. An attractive widow. Have you seen her as of late? Yes. I see here every now and then. It would be nice, Don Francisco, if you'd introduce her to me. I will consider your advice concerning Jovellan cs. You only come here when you're in a bad mood, Pace. Yes. You don't think I might be waiting for you? - No. - Conchita! Show Don Francisco the door. Conchita, return to your kitchen! Don't be mad at me. You know I have a big heart for all that's beautiful. And you are divinely beautiful, Dona Pepa. Aren't you drinking a little much? Why shouldn't I drink? Is the champagne too good for me? People like us have no title but know more about art than the whole Academy and the four universities! He who sits there and must drink 'til he's drunk who paints horses under the asses of defeated generals.. - and assists such business! - As drunk as a coachman! Don't won";- - I'm going I'll tell you something else, you big wigs! L, Agustin Esteve, failed student, I am ashamed for my sake and for yours. So there! - Your cloaks, gentlemen. - Please excuse me, Your Excellency. Now you do some more. But the ears must be much longer. See for yourself! But they can't be bigger than the head. Please paint me a nice, colorful jumping jack. A jumping jack? Alright then. Such a very pretty doll! Elenita! Elenita! Come, don't bother your father at work. But I want to stay here with Papa! Come along, now. You're squandering your time, Pace. Then you'll have to work through the night. Francisco! Gaspar DE Jovellanos gives us the honor. - I'm in Madrid again. - May I? We come to thank you I am very pleased. It's a comfort when friends will risk a brave word for the sake of justice. That even you have taken up the political ideas of our time. You are mistaken, Don Gaspar. I am a painter. I have nothing to do with politics. No artist can abstain from politics. Especially not today, in Spain with a mindless King, a Queen for whom nothing matters save her creature comforts, and a Prime Minister with but a single qualification for the job: Strapping thighs! Aren't you being a little unfair to the count? Of course! Very much so, in fact I don't want to be fair to that scoundrel! But now... Godoy is working to atone for the past. I'm losing sleep over owing this man my gratitude. But let us speak of art. Oh, that's nothing. Those were just done on a whim. "Caprichos. " If I may be frank, you experiment too much with the great, overwhelming truths. You're playing with the color, With the light, dissolving the line. You're wasting your talent. You should use antiquity and its monumental art as your model, like Jacques Louis David. Instead of elegant women, you should paint, for example, lightning-throwing Zeus! Yes, but only if you'd be my model, exactly as you're standing there now. It's too bad you don't take my pleas seriously. You should subordinate more your reason to political necessity. A Jacques Louis David would be of more use to our country than a Mirabeau and all the orators since Cicero. What shall I do? I prefer to be a Spanish painter. We must argue about art more, Goya. I hope to Should've let him stay where he was. And you It's all your fault! Now I must listen to that pedant! Naturally what Jovellanos said about Zeus and David is easily misunderstood. But he's right about wanting to make art political. And your horse's asses? I ask you: are they political? A Spanish David? Nonsense! Yes, you - you could be a Spanish David! Your talent is just about sufficient! I'll tell you something, Don Francisco. I'll tell you something, Pace. I'll tell you, Sir Court Painter, member of the Academy! He is right! Your pictures are ham! - Sure, ham with talent! - Shut your mouth! Look over there. Your Godoy is perhaps satisfied with this effective crap, since he is as vain as you. But like master, like servant. - Won't you shut up, mongrel! - I wouldn't think of it. And I'll tell you something else. Because you lie so well, you're more dangerous than the others. Get out of here! I never want to see you again! Out! You'll have to hear me to the end. Do you think it helps you to scream? Go! For good. I ask Your Majesty for a bit of patience. [Am I impatient then? Stay Marcia]! We're being painted. By the way, you work unusually fast, Don Francisco, and you're much less tiresome than the painters before you. I am proud to hear those words, Your Majesty. But we'd better finish up. That's enough for today. I will wait until Your Majesty grants me another session. [In marcia, Marcia]! You're avoiding me. Why are you avoiding me, Don Francisco? Why don't I ever see you? Don Francisco... my confidante Dona Luisa Beata Eufemia DE Ferrer y Estala. I am extremely pleased to make your acquaintance, Dona Eufemia. Let's go, my little lamb. Don Francisco! I cannot help but notice that you try unusually hard to please the Italian woman. Aren't you a little too bold regarding the queen? I am the Alba. This is my Spain The wand trembled before the name of Alba when our house still lay in the dust of creation. Here, by King Philip's favorite spot. Before this stone, my great- grandfather gave the shortest report a general had ever given to his king. Julio, how did Marsh all Alba's report to King Philipp ll go? "Conquered for the Spanish Crown: 4 kingdoms. Won in decisive victories: 9 campaigns. Successfully carried out: 217 sieges. Service to His Majesty 60 years. " Bravo! At last, you can get all the details right. Remind Eufemia to give you 5 reales. You know, something unusual just occurred me. What is it? How did you happen upon it? My Eufemia told me; she keeps company with witches, you know. And if she ever angers me too much, I'll tell the Inquisition. Don't speak of such blasphemous things, my little lamb. Do you believe in witches and demons? But of course! I've seen enough of them already. And often! Oh, me too! Every now and then, for example, my grandmother's nursemaid appears before me in the night. Yes, yes. She was bu med as a witch. My grandmother told me when I was little. And last night, she came again and spoke to me. Aha! What did she say? Quietly but clearly she told me that I will not grow old, my time is short, and so I should use it well. Don Francisco I intend to go to Madrid for a few days. - I'm leaving Wednesday. - So suddenly? I'll be in Madrid on Wednesday evening and you? I'll be painting the Queen again on Wednesday, and the same on Thursday morning. But you know that. Yes, I know. The Queen herself chose those days. Don Francisco, I will be in Madrid on Wednesday evening. Did I understand you correctly? You did. When are you going to Madrid to get new colors? Colors? We have enough colors for 5 Queens and as many Kings and their entire stable. You are going to Madrid! There you will learn that my daughter is sick and Josepha requires my immediate return. - I don't get it. - You don't need to "get it. " You only have to bring me word that Elenita is sick, and nothing else, alright? You wish to tum down the Queen? Understand this: I must go to Madrid. And you've got no other excuse? Please do it. Alright. You'll get your letter. I've got smuggled tobacco. - What's it cost? - 22 reales. How much? What do I look like - a stray dog? Perhaps your woman is a stray bitch? - Who said that? - I did. Apologize to the lady. At once! First let her remove her mantilla! We want to know who's sitting at our table! Nobody asked you! And you: apologize, or I'll show you I can dance the fandango on your corpse. I'll count to 10. If she doesn't take off her mantilla, I'll kick you to Aranjuez. Duchess Alba! We're going. Bearers! - Where are we going now? - Want to visit another taverna? No. I want to see your studio Dona Maria Luisa on horseback! You dare to paint the Italian woman as ugly as she is? Does she allow you that? Dona Maria Luisa is a clever woman. Therefore she wishes for her portraits to resemble her. If a woman looks like that, she at least needs to be clever May I offer you something perhaps Madam Duchess? Layout call me "Madam Duchess" one more time - I'll leave. - I don't believe you will. I know that you won't go Madam Du chess. You will stay. Stay and destroy me. Why should I destroy you? Why? - Blessed be the Holy Virgin. - Thrice blessed. What did the messenger want? "The Tribunal of the Holy Inquisition, to the great honor of God and the Catholic Church, will hold an assembly concerning heretics. It will take place on the 27th of this month. Your attendance is desirable. Justitia et Misericordia Justice and Mercy By order of the venerable Lord Cardinal Grand Inquisitor. " Do you understand why they're inviting me, of all people? It's all your fault. Yours and yours alone! You'll throw us all into misfortune. My God! It's your immoral conduct, Pace. That's what put you under suspicion of heresy. You have no morals - and therefore you are a heretic! - Oh Holy Virgin, protect us! - No. No, no... Pablo Otero has been arrested and you put in a good word for Jovellanos. - They want to warn you. - No, I won't go. I'm afraid. The Holy Tribunal... and these sinners who are fated to suffer are a memorable portrait of that which we all, trembling, will experience at the Last Judgment. "Irredeemable repulsion," God says "do I reserve for the Jews, Mohammedans and Heretics, since they besmirch my name and my honor. " And as David says. " "Wake up from the clemency, Lord Father, into which your infinite mercy has lulled you. Stand up, oh Lord, and pass judgment in your affairs. Strike down with the full force of your wrath the Heathens and the Non-Believers!" According to these words, the Holy Office here convenes. Amen. Amen. Jose Ont, cook, formerly at the seminar in Valencia. Please rise. Jose Ortiz, you expressed doubt about the miraculous power of the image of our Virgin of Pilar. [)0 you plead guilty? Yes. I plead gum)... Mercy in the name of the Holy Virgin! Do you repent of your doubt? Yes. Yes, by God! I repent! Mercy Mercy! Licentiate Manuel Sanchez Velasco - please rise. In the San Cayetana Church, you said that the saints cannot help heal disease. Do you plead guilty? I plead gum)... Do you repent of your deed? I repent of it. Don Pablo Otero, former Auditor of the Viceroyalty of Peru, former Governor of Seville, former Commander of the Order of Santiago, former Governor-General of Nuevas Poblaciones. Please rise. You are accused of 166 counts of heresy, you have declared that you don't believe in miracles and disputed the fact that non- Catholics are condemned to Hell. You have declared that many of the heathen Roman emperors would be preferable to some of our Christian Lords. You have declared that the Catholic Church is degenerate. You have expressed doubt about Christian dogma. You have declared that spiritual and mental freedom are suppressed in Spain. You have declared that the only way out for our country is the French Revolution. You may sit down. You traveled to Switzerland to find the arch-heretic Voltaire. You translated his writings into the Spanish language. You have repeatedly slandered the Holy Inquisition in your writings. Pablo Otero... do you plead guilty to having committed the heresies named? I plead guilty... Do you foreswear the claim that God had nothing to do with the creation of the Cosmos? I foreswear it. Do you foreswear the claim that the Church is a dark and cruel dungeon of Ignorance? I foreswear it. Do you foreswear your claim that only revolution can give Spain its freedom? I foreswear it. Do you foreswear your godless friend Voltaire? I foreswear him. I foreswear it. I foreswear it. I foreswear it. Maria Rosario Gomez, please rise! Maria Rosario Gomez, you are accused of heresy. You sang forbidden songs that awaken sinful passions and objectionable thoughts in the people. [)0 you plead guilty? I asked you if you'll plead guilty. Please answer my question! Why? Why guilty? Why? Because I sing the old songs of our mothers? Because I give - people courage for - For battle. Was that what you wanted to say? Courage for life and the belief in a happy future. Do we understand you correctly that the Holy Trinity's presence was not predetermined well enough? Belief in the future is always better. Please sing for us. The Holy Tribunal would like to hear one of your songs. One of those that you describe as the "songs of our mothers. " "Winds of the people carry me. Winds of the people tear me away with you. Scatter my heart and swell in my throat. Winds of the people carry me and tear me away with you. " Enough! We have heard you and... understood. Is the accused aware that heretics who do not plead guilty are sent to the stake? I am aware of that. Then once more do you plead guilty? No! No, I won't do it! I am not guilty! Jose Ont is sentenced to 200 strokes of the whip and a 5-year term as a galley slave. Manuel Sanchez Velasco is sentenced to 200 strokes of the whip and a 2-yearterm as a galley slave. We declare Pablo Otero to be a devout heretic, a rotten member of the Christian community. As he reconciled with the Church by foreswearing his heresy, he is sentenced to an 8- year galley term. Mario Rosario Gomez is sentenced No! What for? What for, I ask you people? Open up, Francisco! - He still won't open up? - No. My God, I'm afraid! Francisco! I beg you. What is it? I'm bringing you something to eat. I'm not hungry. No matter- I'll put it here for you. You're possessed by evil spirits, Francisco. I won't say anything. There's nothing to say. Heresy is what it is I did it in two nights. What do you think? How many reales will I get for each one? I intend to exhibit them. That what an unbelievable sacrilege! The man who painted these is one of the most important artists - in all Spain! - You're a painter too? No, Senora, a student. - You're a heretic! A heretic! - How much does that one cost? - What's it cost? I'm sorry, Senior, but those paintings are already sold. A pity. To an art enthusiast no doubt. Nice art! To the stake with this painter, this blasphemer. Along with his paintings! Jesus Christ be praised. For eternity. Amen. His Eminence, the venerable Lord Grand Inquisitor, expects you in his office right away. Blessed be the Holy Virgin. Thrice blessed. As for the bullfight painting, it is a scene from folk life. It conceals no forbidden ideas. These paintings are pious works. There aren't any naked woman's bodies. Even the legs of the Holy Virgin are modestly covered. Nothing is depicted that is contrary to the Church's commandments. The paintings of the Holy Tribunal and the procession re?ect the cleansing terror to which the Holy Inquisition aspires in God's name. My son you should give these paintings as a gift to the Inquisition I consider it as a special honor, if you deem me worthy of it, Your Eminence. The Holy Inquisition will impart fitting recognition unto you. The Almighty gives us the right to mercy. Sometimes. Do not cry, my daughter. It is the will of the Lord. "Let the child come unto me," says our Redeemer. And thus it is God's will to take the children of Spain unto him. There, with him it will be better. Throat disease has taken away many children already. No. I am to blame, believe me I alone. I sacrificed my little daughter. She gave me the lie - that woman told me to send you to Madrid, and now I'm being punished. The devil made the lie come true. Witch! A thrice-cursed witch! Your daughter died I was told. - I came in order to - You dare come here? To my house? First you kill my child, then you come here to shamelessly mock me? - Control yourself, Francisco! - You planned it all! You wanted to steal everything I hold dear! You'd do anything to have me for the lust of your loins! Your accursed infertile loins! You witch! Senor Goya from the village of Fuentetodos. You have remained what you always were a simple-minded farmer. You want to be a Spanish noble? You're a common court jester! You don't need to be a witch to get you dancing like a puppet. You're a jumping jack, a straw man! Yes, come on you idiot farmer! Your arms are stronger than mine. Pace! What's wrong with you, Pace? Everything will be fine again. Everything will be fine. Please believe me! - Any word from your wife? - N at yet. It is a mockery to assemble such Peers merely because some backward doctor received his license to practice medicine. And precisely when we should be mourning your spouse's death You know who the new Ambassador is? He sentenced the poor French King to death. Excellency, their Majesties await you. I've already requested not to be addressed as "Excellency. " The officials of our Republic are called "Citizen. " Since the title "Citizen" is not usual in Spain, I forgot it. Please forgive me, Excellency. His Excellency, the Ambassador of the Republic of France! Your Catholic Majesties! Your Royal Highnesses! Your Excellencies! It is a great honor to represent the newly-founded Republic of France in the Kingdom of Spain for the first time. I take this opportunity to assure you that my government and the French nation are anxious to establish a bond of friendship with the Spanish people, in keeping with - our revolutionary principles. - Yes, yes. We're happy. We are glad to receive this confirmation of friendship from the Ambassador of the French Republic. We regret that our country is, at this time, in deep mourning over a great loss. But that's life. Joy and suffering often go hand in hand. Yes, yes. We're really full of sorrow. - Do you love her very much? - That's no longer important. I don't understand. Why did you let her leave with the Abbot? Dona Lucia wished to accompany him. Anyway, she can also serve our interests in Paris. Miguel, I have to tell you something. I am happy to know you. Senores! Pablo Otero is free. He is on his way to France Let's not celebrate too early. Wait until he's out of danger. The Abbot can't get him over the mountains 'til early tomorrow. I I didn't go to the funeral because I thought it better to keep my distance. But I feel for you deeply. I once had to advise you, dear friend, not to let any more rumors about you arise. You preferred to throw my sisterly advice to the wind. I'll be frank: it's no longer about you. I'm thinking of those who'll bear the name 'Alba' after you. Pardon me, but I don't understand, Madam. But I infer from your comments that I have incurred Your Majesty's displeasure. You are clearly unwilling or unfit to protect the honorable name of Alba, as it is your duty to do. I must therefore help you. I did not ask for your help Madam. I don't want it. I must entreat you to stay away from Madrid, at least for the period of mourning 3 Years? The length of the mourning period for the widow of a 1st class Peer. I am deeply grateful for your motherly concem. To take the opportunity to leave more portraits of me for posterity, the painter Francisco DE Goya will accompany me. The painter Francisco DE Goya will remain here. His Majesty will honor him with a great commission. You will have to travel without his company, ma chere. Any more objection s? No, Majesty. I see you have thought of everything. Go in peace, my child. I have conceived of it as follows: You are to paint something pretty, comfortable and yet dignified. I could be checking my watch or playing the violin. The Queen would be reading, my youngest playing tag. Everyone is pleasantly occupied, yet there's a kind of dignity. - You understand? - Yes, yes. If you'd give me some time, I'd like to think about it. That's fine, my friend - please think. We're in no rush. The right idea will come to you. When it does, then let us know. Look over there, Don Francisco. That's an exact replica of my frigate, the Santissima Trinidad. Please, my friend, be so kind as to retrieve my ship? Did I hear correctly? You need me to get into the water? Yes, please! Or else it won't sail any more. Here! Don Francisco. Don Francisco! Over here! Here! Don Francisco! - Please take it, Your Majesty. - Thank you. Yes, you make a very stately figure. You'll be on the picture too, Don Francisco. How about a short wrestling match? Let's feel your arm muscles! Hmmm not bad. - But now feel mine. - Very well, Your Majesty. I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I I didn't mean to. Don't worry: "war is, as war does," mon chere! So. What now, Don Francisco? I really gave it to you. Now I really gave it to you! Yes. Here is better. Your Majesties and Your Highnesses: May I ask you to gather casually over there? How are you envisioning this, Don Francisco? What about my violins, my clocks? Everyone in a row? I wanted to create something dignified. I thought that the members of the royal family should stand in the painting as Kings and Infantes of Spain, as God made them. Your idea isn't bad, Don Francisco. Just do it. Would his Royal Highness, the Prince of Asturias, kindly go - to the corner. - Why to the comer? Why should the child stand here and me in the corner? It's artistically desirable to bring His Majesty's figure to its full importance. I don't see why my dignity isn't important! Because you're too tall. Be silent, Don Fernando, and go to the corner. No, I still don't like it. Let's try it over there. Please arrange yourselves again st the opposite wall. Maybe the light is better over there. Yes, like that. No, I was wrong. I must ask Your Majesties and Royal Highnesses to go back to their earlier positions. The interaction of the colors is not good yet. May I ask His Highness, the Infante, to wear a bright red. And then His Royal Highness the Prince of Asturias should - perhaps wear a light blue. - This red is my favorite color! - You're wearing blue! - Please stay put. Don't move. Such effort, such talent and imagination have these authorities had to muster to bring such a blessed country as ours to this point. Yes. In this picture, I see generals who only lose battles! Extravagance! State coffers picked clean! Crowned scarecrows! And I feel the destitution of the people, their ignorance - Ah, you see all that? - Yes. - Here? - Yes, here! Amazing! I must have a lack of imagination. That's not what I painted. - You didn't understand me - He understood you perfectly but he's an Aragonese farmer who plays dumb. Which you don't need to do, because you are dumb! Well? What do you think? An unconventional picture different, very original. But Say what you mean I won't take it badly I'm getting used to you people. Have the King and Queen seen the sketches yet? - No, nobody's asked for them. - All the better. Don't take it the wrong way, but let me give you some advice. I wouldn't treat them so pitilessly. Perhaps you could at least make Carlos and Maria Luisa look a bit friendlier. Of all of us, you're the one who sees this company in the mildest terms. I don't see them either mild or hard but rather: exactly as they are! Why are you laughing? Come here. Hold me. - Are you leaving today? - Yes, my dearest. When will you be done with the picture? I don't know yet. Little lamb, the coach is ready. I'll be right there. Pace, paint your picture and come quickly to me. Make haste! Ride as if the Inquisition were at your heels! I'll be waiting. End of Part 1 June 14th 22 minutes past 10 o'clock. You have delivered the painting on schedule. Show it to us, Don Francisco? Part 2 You did an excellent job, Don Francisco. It is a good and truthful work that will bear witness for posterity of how we Bourbons are. A magnificent portrait! A big picture. Exactly as we wanted it. Put your hat on, Francisco DE Goya. Put your hat on, Don Francisco! As of today, you are First Court Painter to the King. As of today, you may keep your hat on your head in my presence. Thank you very much. Thank you, Your Majesty. Your Majesties! Royal Highnesses! May I ask you where your heads are? Beheaded. Never before has a painter beheaded an entire dynasty! Francisco DE Goya y Lucientes has done it. And when the ashes of Your Royal Highnesses are scattered to the four winds Goya will live on. Yes, you'll need to take your hat off. The hat of Goya the Peer from the head of Goya the painter. You viper's tongue! You idiot! You damned color dauber! My one and only friend, Agustin! My little lamb, aren't you hungry? I want to show the Sir Court Painter our watchtower first. Please be patient. You have better pictures. - And how do you like this? - Well. Very well Pity. It's badly damaged. It has hung here for ages, since the time of my great-grandfather. This lady is a lazy lady! You shouldn't surprise us like that, Padilla! Whenever I visit this lady, she's lying naked, looking at herself smugly in the mirror, and lounging around. This is Padilla, Court Jester to my grandfather. He was badly beaten as a child and then no longer grew. She does well to reside in this tower, the naked lady. Who would receive her otherwise bereft of clothing as she is? Nobody, I'd say! And yet she is such a beautiful lady. - A 1st class noblewoman, a Peer - Good, good, Padilla. Now go. Was this woman a Peer? No, no. Reminds you of the picture from Velazquez, "Fable of Arachne. " You know, the one who unwinds the thread? Her hair, shoulders, her position. Very pretty. Gorgeous. But I wouldn't paint her like that today. And how would you? I don't know. In any case, it's forbidden to paint naked women in Spain. You probably only paint what's permitted, Sir Court Painter. - Have I told you I love you? - No. I love you, you bumpkin from Fuendetodos. A wonderful painting, Pace It looks similar to the other one, the naked one. No. That was a girl of the people. This here is an aristocrat-in- disguise, who believes - she belongs to the people. - You want to anger me, Pace. But you won't succeed. Did you give her her true face? Maybe that's it? Without the borrowed dress, exactly as she is: Seductive and dangerous. You're mistaken, Pace. That that isn't my face. Yes, that isn't your face. But it is you. No. - That isn't me! - This lady is a lazy lady! This lady is a But this lady wasn't here. This is another one oh! That's my Lady: Cayetana DE Alba! Madonna in Heaven! Oh God! Heaven have mercy! Turn away from us the righteous wrath of the Holy Inquisition! Merciful God Oh, Marquis! I had to see you again, Duquesita! Good morning, Don Francisco. Enchanting as always, Dona Cayetana. Dear Marquis, how nice to see you again! Why do you remember a poor exile only now? I wasn't in Madrid. I was on assignment in India and Africa. But now I'm in Cadiz. My friends and I would like to invite you to go hunting for a few days, Duquesita. - You as well, Don Francisco. - I won't be coming along. - But you, Duquesita? - I don't know. No, she won't be going either. When shall we leave, Marquis? - When ever you'd like. - But I said you're not going. - I am going. So early tomorrow? - Splendid! But first, dear Marquis, perhaps you would like to go up to your room. - Eufemia! - My little lamb. Eufemia, show the Marquis his room. Why are you acting like this? I won't be bossed around! You won't accompany him that ape, that You're mistaken, my dear. I decide what I do and allow. Pace! We were being dumb. Be reasonable again, Pace. I'll accompany the Marquis and be back in a few days. Then you won't find me here. I would truly regret that, Pace. You cannot change me. You have to take me as I am. I've said that I'm going, and I will go. But I promise you I'll be back in a few days and all will be as it was. Yes? No it won't be! Whore! I regret that the picture had to suffer. Name your price and Eufemia will pay for it. My God, how dumb you are, Pace. You have understood absolutely nothing. I have always loved only you, Pace. You never realized that, you stupid fat, old man. Do you think I want to?y to Hell with the others? You wicked, ugly and lonely man! You're bad and jealous and boundlessly stupid. But I'm only fond of you - only you, you outspoken painter! Accursed witch! Taking me for a fool. You unfaithful, vain, depraved WITCH! What's your name? - My name is Gil. - Very well, Sancho Panza, I'm in need of you. But my name is Gil, not Sancho Panza! Don't be so insulted. You're as much Sancho Panza as I am Don Quixote. Anyway, how about it, amigo? - Shall we go to Saragossa? - To Saragossa? - That's too far for me. - What'd you charge for it? - 800 reales. - I don't hear very well. - 800. 800! - I see. 500. Your poor hearing won't make it any easier for my mule and me. I wish you luck, you high-bum. My final offer 785! Agreed. How about 600? Damn it! Go to the Devil with whatever he wants! You know what you're trying to barter for? No common mule! No! The most famous mule in all of Spain. His name is Valeroso! His father's father that was the donkey Constants, who once threw a heretic from his back, one Thomas Trebino. A pious donkey he was! A good whore needs no matchmaker. So.. - 750! That's final! - Stop yelling at me! You'll always get the shorter straw, because you can hear me, but I can't hear you. Say 650, then it's done, and we won't fight any more! Listen, my Sancho Panza I'm neither Sancho nor Panza. My name is Gil. Yes. You're right, as always. Believe me, my dear Sancho Panza They they want to destroy us! But we'll keep our chins up, eh? - Who wants to destroy us? - The demons! The evil spirits, they want to scare us. - Scare us? Why? - Even those we once loved - and now despise. - Just eat, Valeroso. But courage! They won't succeed with us. Because we're Aragonese! And our mothers suckled us with defiance instead of milk! It doesn't matter that we're both deaf, Sancho Panza. Says you! We'll deal with it. Definitely. The deaf can see better, so they paint better too. We will paint as we never have before! Things have a hidden sense... and a hidden melody. We will capture it... because we are deaf. The deaf see and hear better. You understand? You are right, as always. One must recognize the hidden sense of things. No need to fear, we'll do it. Some will call us crazy. That doesn't matter either. We'll wander around until our hands no longer shake. We'll do it. And why? Because we're Aragonese. Giddy up! Giddy up! Giddy up! Hey! Come push! Go on! Many thanks for the help. Thank you, Seniority! Giddy up! Giddy up! Come on, Sancho! - Well then - You can stay the night with - me and my mother if you'd like. - No, I've got to head back. - What'd you say? - It's along way to Cadiz. And it'll be twice as far, as I'll be traveling alone. It's completely up to you. We agreed on 800 reales. Take it. On 650. - And not a penny more! - You stubborn mule, you! It is as I said: 800 reales! - You won't get the better of me! - No, my deaf friend. - You'll need the money. - Take it! That is your money! I have more money than you think. I am the Court Painter! And I am a mule-driver. You understand me? Farewell, my deaf friend. It was nice traveling with you. I wish you good health. Take the money, I beg you! Go, Sancho Panza, and light a candle for me. For my health. I can do that. Layout should need me again, you know well where I while away my days. And my name is Gil. My name is Gil! Sit down, Francisco. Mama, you must speak very clearly- and slowly. - I am now totally deaf. - Sit down and drink your Rosoli. You don't need to say anything. I know everything. You are late in finding your way home. In Madrid, you became arrogant and conceited. I always told you that you won't evade your punishment, that you will come to a bad end. The worst deaf man is he who does not wish to hear! Drink! Come. I will bathe you, Francisco. Can you understand that? I'd like to try to explain it to you. What you see here, the monsters on these pages, I saw with my own two eyes. You need only speak slowly. I have learned to read lips. My boy, do they torment you, the demons? They torment Spain. - Are you afraid of them? - No longer. But maybe I've really gone mad. I don't know, Francisco. He who can see his insanity so clearly is surely more - rational than other people. - Yes, yes. When I let them out of me, the demons, when I nail them down, when I bind them to the paper, I no longer fear them. One shouldn't tempt fate Francisco. Fate has struck you hard. Elenita is gone. You're deaf. Poor Josepha is dead. She was a good wife to you. You have summoned the demons to you. The demons will destroy you. I want for people to see these monsters as they are. I want to awaken their reason. Monsters are always born wherever reason sleeps, Mama. And that's why I will paint them. I have to I understand, my boy. You must have great courage. I will pray. The Holy Virgin will protect you. The audience must be postponed. Her Majesty will send for you. Horrible. Do I really look like the whore with two faces? I saw it as my duty to alert you to these scribblings. Such work has nothing more to do with art. It's barbaric! Primitive tricks of a poor fool, the jokes of a straw puppet. Pretty jokes That's how the world looks to the First Court Painter to His Majesty! I'm rather curious as to how the Inquisition will react. Heaven protect him. Oh my God, please not that! Jesus Christ be praised. Will you please confim, Senior DE Goya, that I have delivered a letter from the Holy Inquisition to you? Blessed be the Holy Virgin. Thrice blessed. Thrice blessed. Thrice blessed. "The dream of reason produces monsters. " "You, who cannot cast them off. " "Climbing up and falling down "Swallow, you dog!" It is time It is time That is yours? Yes. And the titles are also by you? Yes, by me. What is the reason for these works? Merely to express what is in the captions or perhaps something else? If Your Eminence believes to have discovered something in my works, a hidden meaning, it would be purely coincidental. L... I'm not very clever in my choice of words. Why be so humble then? On the contrary, your words have been carefully chosen. Whom do these works serve? Do they serve the well-being of the Church? They serve the truth. If I understand correctly, you distinguish between the Church and the truth? I'm asking if you differentiate between the Church and the truth! - The Church is above truth. - A curious answer. Extremely curious. In Capricho Number 23, one finds the Holy Tribunal of the Inquisition and a condemned woman. In the caption, you write: "To treat a righteous woman this way - wicked. " Wicked. Who, in your opinion, has treated this woman so wickedly? The Holy Tribunal, perhaps? Who? Fate. What do you see as fate? Do you mean Divine Providence? Forgive me, Your Eminence. You know I'm completely deaf. I must always guess at what you are asking me, and quite possibly I misunderstood your question. If your ears will not hear, then perhaps your eyes will see. The demons! Spain, Your Eminence. But I believe in God. Let that be all for today. Please close the record. You have clearly answered my questions. - Eminence, please permit - It is pointless. It is pointless to keep fighting. We would simply complicate things even further. Now please try to understand me. I don't wish to hide from you that our Holy Church is in a diff cult position. Sinful, heretical ideas have confused people's souls today and their faith in God and His Commandments has been shaken. We cannot accept it. With kindness and authority, with authority and kindness, we unwaveringly battle for our faith's purity. I helped you once. And now it is time for you to give us your help Foreswear these pictures! Think my suggestion over in peace. But beware of your pride. Should it give you the wrong advice, consider the consequences because they are heavy. Now leave me. Please follow me. Stop. Close up. May God forgive us for these sinful pictures. This is no longer a Church. Satan was at work here. This is not a prison! Long live the revolution! Where is Quintana? In chains. Quintana: in chains. Maria Rosario: executed. Jovellan cs: arrested. Pablo Otero: in exile. Together with the others. The new king and the Inquisition rage like never before. Francisco, you must leave Madrid. For a long time, I'm afraid. Perhaps forever. They don't care what kind of painter you are, great or small You drew the Caprichos about the horrors of war, you and no one else. And they won't forgive you for it. The Inquisition has warned the painter Goya twice. There is no third warning. So you'd like to devour me? But see: I myself am feasting! The dead to their graves! The living onto the tables! I still have all my teeth and my appetite. Splendid! Where is Goya? Where is Goya? Goya is gone. No one can escape divine retribution. I condemn Goya to eternal oblivion. He is cursed. Cursed and forgotten for eternity. Translation and subtitles by Evan Turner Song Translation by J.L. Gili @2008 DEFA Film Library University of Massachusetts Amherst
