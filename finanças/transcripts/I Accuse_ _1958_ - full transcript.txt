Give this to your military attaché. - This way. - Thanks. The major wishes to see the attache. The military attaché will receive you. Colonel Von Schwarzkoppen? Yes, major. Ferdinand Esterhazy, 74th Infantry Regiment, based in Rouen. Sit down. Merci. - You are welcome. - Thanks. Yes, Major? I have information... to sell. What kind ? Military. French military secrets. But you are a French officer. I also have debts. My wife is sick. Let's just say my business isn't looking good. It's suicide or our business. And I prefer to live. My government does not wish to corrupt a French officer. But suppose... the officer is already corrupt. Good day. Here is a list of documents for sale. The New Artillery Handbook. The diagram of the hydraulic brake on the 120 mm gun. And the defense plans... of the forts of the Meuse. I also hope to be transferred to the general staff. To information. You follow me ? I can be reached at this address. Colonel, I aspire to a happy and profitable association. Esterhazy. Captain, call me Berlin. Colonel Meller. 3e BUREAU MANOEUVRES Everything was ready. We had just brought the wine and his mother arrived. If they ate? Like two ogres. Bonjour. Bonjour. How are you today? I have trouble opening my eyes. Hello, Dreyfus. Hello, Captain Brossard. What did you spend the evening on? On maneuver plans. Attention, Dreyfus. Not overzealous. Are you going to become a general? General? Or Marshal of France? Come in. - Major Picquart. - Entrez, Dreyfus. I finished the report. Already? You worked all night? Good work. - In so little time. - Thank you, Major. How are you otherwise? Well I think. I'm doing my best. - I say. It's painful. - Not really. But I hope it won't make much difference soon. That I am Jewish. The army hates change. And it's new to have a Jewish officer on the staff. But I'm glad to have you. Thank you, major. - Major Picquart. - Major Henry ? All your officers report to the map room. Emergency. Minister's order. Very well. I wonder what's going on. Tell your colleagues and let's go. Yes, major. Your attention, gentlemen. General Mercier, Minister of War, wants to speak to the officers. Repos. Colonel Sandherr of Counterintelligence wants to address you in my presence. The defense plan of the Meuse forts has disappeared. Since last summer, several documents have disappeared. It is feared that information vital to our country are in German hands. A secret investigation revealed to us that the spy is among us. A staff officer. If you have a reason, no matter how trivial, to suspect a fellow officer, say it to me. You are consigned. No permission will be granted. On call in 24 hours. Rompez. Excuse me, I'm looking for Major Henry. I saw the light, I allowed myself to enter. Of course. He must be with Colonel Sandherr. - I can find it for you. - How nice. Thank you, Dreyfus. You must be very busy with the start of the manoeuvres. Oui. How long have you been there? Not really. - After you. - Thanks. Esterhazy! Henry. - You are late. - No, I searched the whole building. It's been a lease. Three months in Rouen seemed like an eternity to me. - Good night, gentlemen. - Come in, Dreyfus. Come and taste the brandy of counterintelligence. He is going well. Please transfer me to Paris or I'll die. Dreyfus, that old friend is the most debauched officer in the whole army. His debts are enormous, his wife, in tears... His friends, too frank. But we don't get bored with him. - Marguerite is giving a supper. - Sorry, I can't. I thought we were going to play cards. Not this evening. We were counting on you. I have work. Health. - And you, Captain? - Sorry, I'm married. I mean they're waiting for me at home. My brother has just arrived in Paris. He is on a business trip. I understand. - What are you working on so late? - The spy. Dirty story. He's an officer. An officer ? A spy ? I fear it. - Do you know who it is? - No, but we're burning. An agent at the German embassy captured a letter with the writing of the spy. Repos. Henry, get me the list of officers. Colonel, this is Major Count Ferdinand Esterhazy. Dreyfus, you know. Dreyfus, I know. Esterhazy. Hungarian? By birth, but I am French. We no longer count the officers who come from elsewhere. Well... Thanks for the brandy. When you want. Your colonel is not very pleasant. Don't worry about Sandherr. He's a security freak. He hates all foreigners. He is sick. Dreyfus is a foreigner? No, he's Jewish. It's quite foreign for Sandherr. - A Jew on the staff? - It's the first. Sandherr was against it, but it was received. It ends well. - We've got a busy night, sorry. - It's nothing. So much for tonight. - And tomorrow ? - Perfect, see you tomorrow. Henry... Don't forget my transfer. I will do my best. - Yes sir ? - Look at "D". - Sorry ? - Names that start with "D". The letter "D". We almost have the spy. - How ? - Look. A German message to the Italian attache intercepted an hour ago. "Sorry to miss you. See you next week." "Attached are 12 nice shots that the crook "D" "gave me for you." The "D" crook? He's our man. He is in the general staff. He is or was in the artillery. This letter is from the German Embassy and we know that his name begins with "D". Darlan, don't. Derlain, I don't think so. Dolbert, I don't know. A good item. In the cavalry. Dreyfus. Dreyfus. Where was he before? Excuse me. Artillery. Artillery. Glue, glue. It's the spy's handwriting. Compare it to that of Dreyfus. If it's the same, it's him. I call Major Du Paty, the handwriting expert. Do it right away. - Don't talk about it. - Good. Peter, watch out. You almost broke the mirror. - Seven years of misfortune. - Why ? Bonjour, ch�ri. Because that's how it is. - Because you won't see each other again. - Seven years without a mirror, I like it. - Glad to see you again, Alfred. - Mathieu, have we gained weight? A real businessman. Lucie. How is General Dreyfus? - I arrested the Kaiser. - Oh yes ? - Supply intact? - Yes, captain. Communications �tablies ? R�serves op�rationnelles ? That's good, General. Don't excite him. It's almost 7:30 p.m. It's time to go to bed. - You already trained him. - Of course, he's a future soldier. - Like Napoleon. - Oh no. - Why ? - First of all... he was too small and way too big. Like me. We are soldiers and he is jealous. - Napoleon was small like me? - Much smaller. General, to bed. Say good evening to Uncle Mathieu. - Good evening, Peter. - Good night, son. One. And Claire didn't come to the wedding. I miss them. - Go home. - Impossible. I know, the army. If you don't come home, she comes to you. - Do I have any surprises for you? - Any surprises? I will show you. I have presents from the family. Alfred, this is for you. It's a tent. Aunt Miriam wanted to give you this. Merci. It's the baby. Try to put her back to sleep. What did you do to her? A Alfred ? Nothing. Why ? He is rather human. It always has been for me. You know what I mean. He is always so serious, so absorbed in the army. At least he's laughing. He is happy. He gets what he wants, I guess. He is in the general staff. And he has you. Look. - I can't put her back to sleep. - Looked. - Adorable. - That's all Lucy. A future Joan of Arc at the head of an army. No, that's enough. In bed. - I am going too. Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, Lucy. - I'm going up right away. I confess that I envy you. Lucia, the children. Everything but... I was hoping that one day we would be reunited. The Dreyfus brothers working together. I am happy here. You do not need me. No need. Urge. You find it strange, but I prefer to be captain than the President of France. - Major. - Hello, Captain. C'�tait Dreyfus. Major Du Paty, Major Picquart. Bonjour. - You know Major Picquart. - An old friend. - Hello, Henry. - Hello. So this is his handwriting? uh well... Selon the th�orie de Bertillon, without forgetting mine, there is a clear similarity. Especially in the formation of letters "A" et "N". I'm tracking a spy, not an artist. Is that his handwriting? Whose writing? Yes, to the east. We have unmasked the spy of the General Staff, Major Picquart. Your recruit, Dreyfus. - Dreyfus? - Yes. I called you because you are his superior and you are responsible of his appointment to the general staff. I do not believe it. Approach. Recently our agent found this in Von Schwarzkoppen's office, the German attache. Hold. - Military documents. - Stolen from headquarters. I recognize them. Yesterday we intercepted this between Schwarzkoppen and Italy. "Attached are 12 plans of Nice that the crook... L'escroc "D" ? I gave the list to Du Paty with a document written by Dreyfus. There is no doubt, both are from the hand of Dreyfus. I admit it is disturbing. The security of the country requires rapid action. Of course. But I don't believe Dreyfus is an enemy agent. - Why ? - Money. He doesn't need the money. Remember. I didn't want him on the staff. I was passed over. You who know Dreyfus best, can you enlighten us? I still have a hard time believing it. Very well. Don't tell anyone. We don't want publicity. Major Du Paty, call Dreyfus. Ask him. - Make him talk. - Yes, Colonel. He will be locked up until the court-martial. That's it. Come in, captain. I am Major Du Paty de Clam. You wanted to see me. Simple routine. Sit down. I would like you to write me a few words. You like to write, don't you? - Yes. - Good. I injured my hand and I would like to dictate a message to you. Of course. The pen and the ink are there. Pr�t, major. Write as follows: "There is no indication that you wish to see me again. - "However, I send you... - Excuse me. A little slower. Why ? Did you forget? - Forgot what? - No matter. "...wish to see me again." Yes ? "However, I am sending you some interesting information. "Number 1, a note "on the hydraulic brake of the 120 mm gun." Your hand is shaking. It must be cold. Cold ? Are you cold, gentlemen? No. Neither do I. You must be fragile. Why am I here? What does that mean? Identical. Will you explain to me... Alfred Dreyfus, in the name of the law, I arrest you. - I charge you with high treason. - Treason ? You... It must be a test. You can confess. Admit what? What did I do ? The evidence is overwhelming. I fear, Dreyfus, that there is no other solution. That's the lesser of it for the uniform you soil. I have not committed any crime. Take him. Sit down. - Alfred has often spoken to me about you. - Well, I hope. And how. Charge! - General Dreyfus, reporting. - Carry on, General. I'm not a general, but my father is a captain. Honey, they know daddy. Go play. - I'm chasing the Kaiser. - Yes, go play. And make less noise. Alfred has not returned. He is at the ministry. We know it. - What do you want ? - We're also hunting the Kaiser. He means we have a search warrant. Ici ? Lets go see. Where is Alfred? What are you looking for ? How do you get the keys? - He gave them to you. - He was very cooperative. And you will be too. Please excuse us. Do not touch me ! Wait... Alfred. Let me see it. - Let me talk to him. - It's impossible. At least his lawyer. Non. Not until the trial date is set. Can we at least know what he did? He knows it. We know it. That's enough. Colonel Sandherr... What keeps us from warning the press? Your own common sense. In case of betrayal, public opinion is often violent. Especially if the traitor is... like your brother. I advise you, to help your husband, not to say anything until the date and place of the trial are fixed. Come on, Lucy. We have two children. D�sol�. We'll meet again, Colonel. We found nothing compromising in Dreyfus. He is smart. But our only proof is an unsigned letter. - And his handwriting. - They are not identical. He disguised it. It's natural. I'm sure Dreyfus is guilty. The minister too. His guilt is obvious. If you don't believe it, say so. I believe him guilty. But do we have enough evidence to present before the court martial? We will find evidence. We have a week ahead of us. Ask him. Well sir. Hello Henry. - How are you? - I'm very busy. - I'm coming from Paris this morning. - Good. What's new ? - Something new? - For my transfer. I haven't had the chance to talk about it. Captain Lauth, the file on the Italian Embassy. Well sir. We found the spy. Who is this ? Dreyfus. The guy you bumped into here. Dreyfus. Our agent intercepted a letter from Dreyfus adress�e � l'attach�. A list of secret documents. Suddenly, my problems seem trivial. I better come back tomorrow morning when you're less busy. Don't tell anyone. Of course not. I have original info. A spy at the German Embassy. They intercepted a message I sent to you. They have it at the ministry. - Are you suspected? - Nope. They arrested an officer named Dreyfus. - Dreyfus ? - Alfred Dreyfus. Is he one of your agents? Non. As long as they think he's the spy, I can work safely. - What if they find him innocent? - That's not gonna happen. I'll create a little diversion. Scandal. Raising public opinion. Let me do it. Your money is in the usual place. Mr. Drumont, some would find me disloyal. To go to an editor like you. Not disloyal, Major. Patriot. Merci. - You are welcome. - Thanks. - Is this officer in jail yet? - Yes. And you're sure he's not a German agent? It's impossible. Why doesn't the army judge him? He has powerful friends. General Mercier thinks it will rub off on him if one of his most placid officers, his pet, finds himself accused of treason. What's her name ? Dreyfus. Alfred Dreyfus. German ? Alsatian. A Jewish family. Jewish? I don't know how to compensate you. You're welcome. "And Captain Alfred Dreyfus "is accused of selling information -"to a foreign government." - And an attack on the Jews. The army needed a scapegoat. Your brother is perfect. Mme Dreyfus, I told you that I would defend your husband if I believed him innocent. It's the case. After talking to Colonel Sandherr, I'm sure. Thanks a lot. Mr Demange, could I see Alfred? Just talk to him. I see the minister this afternoon. I will ask. He has to let me see Alfred. It's too cruel. Surely that is not their intention. Soon they will admit their mistake and they will release him. Thank you so much. Mme Dreyfus. Marie ? Would you mind paying for my week? I go home. And the problem? I read the journal. I know what the captain did. Marie. You know him. You know that's wrong. I know what I read. I go home. Leave immediately. Don't say anything to the children. Understood ? They'll know soon enough. The general cannot receive you. - Write to him. - When will he receive me? Next week. He is very busy. Write him a letter. What do I look like ? How does the army look? One of my officers is a German spy. And who warned the press? Who told them? C'�tait in�vitable. Of course, Colonel Sandherr, with your infallible security, the press will know all about us. - The German embassy too. - I want to be relieved of my post. Do not tempt me. Where are we? The court-martial will meet next Monday. - And the file? - Concrete. Good. Sorry, Colonel, but I don't think so. Really ? Why ? The proof against Dreyfus is a simple letter - and writing... - What? You're running away for bringing a spy to headquarters. I am not his friend, but if we can't indict him, we will be the laughingstock of the public. Exact. I hope you realize that the honor of the army and the security of the State are at stake. We will have the verdict you like. He will be guilty. Very well. You will insist on a closed session. I don't want the press. As you wish. Du Paty... You will be our main witness. Are you absolutely certain that Dreyfus wrote this letter? Oui, g�n�ral. According to Bertillon's theory of writing, and my own theory, the famous spiral loop, opposite the angular tip, indicates beyond a shadow of a doubt that the letter was written by Captain Dreyfus. And how did Captain Dreyfus react by copying the letter? R�agi ? He acted guilty. He trembled. His handwriting resembled that of the letter? In effect. Although he naturally tried to hide it. Merci. Mr. Demange, the witness is yours. You claim that Captain Dreyfus betrayed himself - by copying this letter. - No, I affirm it. Fine sir, major. Under oath you swear that Captain Dreyfus acted guilty. That's right. How does a culprit react? I affirmed under oath that Dreyfus had reacted like a culprit. I have nothing to add. He spent hours studying the reports, pretending to work on maneuvers. He was working late. He left the office last. Now we know why. We were at war school. Il �tait tr�s r�serv�. Always hostile towards us. He had money, but we didn't know where it came from. He was the kind of man who wanted to learn everything. Of course. A spy wants to know everything. Major Henry of the statistics section wishes to testify. Major Henry. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I swear. Major Henry, we're listening. The court should know that last March and July, an untouchable citizen contacted me� to warn me of the presence of a spy at headquarters. Did he give his name? Oui. What was his name? Alfred Dreyfus ! Liar. You're lying ! Who accused him? I can't tell. I demand that Major Henry's testimony be suppressed for not wanting to cite his sources. Major Henry is within his rights. Other interests are at stake. You must not name the accuser if you swear on your honor as an officer that this person named Dreyfus as the traitor. I swear. I call Captain Dreyfus. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I swear. Captain Dreyfus, did you write this letter? No sir. Your fellow officers have entrusted us that you often work late at the ministry. Why ? Duty calls me. A commendable activity that has been deemed culpable. Objection, the interpretation rubs off on the nature of the army. Detention. You were also said to be indifferent, even hostile towards your colleagues. - Did you know ? - No sir. But I knew... What did you know? I knew very well that... I wasn't quite accepted. What made you suspicious? Yes, I wanted to be kind. I tried. So, I assume your family is German. - No, French. - Where were you born? - In Mulhouse. - Where is it? - In Alsace-Lorraine. - It's part of Germany. - Not when I was born. - But it's east today. Yes sir. In fact, Alsace has been part of Germany since 1870. My family moved to France when I was little. You come from a region which has been part of Germany for most of your life. Why did you choose the French and not the German army? I am French. I was born French. My family is French. I dedicate my life to the French army. Of course. I gave up a comfortable life to become a soldier. Why would I betray? I have money. The court must know that the Dreyfus factory burned down last year. She was insured in Germany. How do I know if the bounties haven't exceeded the damage? There are protests... How do you know if the German state does not support the Dreyfus family via this insurance company. It's just a guess. I protest. Detention. Thank you, Major Du Paty. But in the future, be sure to ask to speak. Sorry, but I had to point that out. Is your family business insured in Germany? I do not know. Does your family do business in Germany? I suppose. I do not know. But they respect France like me. I'm sure that's true. It clearly appears that the prosecution has built its case on a single piece of evidence. A letter supposed to be from the hand of Dreyfus. The charges against him are based on an inadmissible element that they embellish with details on his race and his personality which have nothing to do in this case. He is an honest officer unjustly accused. I know you will find him innocent. We exposed his sprawling life. And its relations with Germany. His fundamental hostility to what we love. There's no doubt that Dreyfus is indeed the crook "D" quoted in a communication between two great powers. My colleagues consider that the evidence presented is purely circumstantial, and I wish to leave the accusation rely entirely on this document the origin of which one hardly doubts. Gentlemen, here is the tangible proof of Alfred Dreyfus' betrayal, of his horrible deceit to the country that welcomed him. Alfred Dreyfus. What do you have to say? I am innocent. The session adjourned pending the verdict of the jurors. Mme Dreyfus, I prefer to tell you that your husband wanted to kill himself last night. But he is safe and sound. Just a few minutes, order of General Mercier. Open the door. They wouldn't let me see you. Do the children know? No. Pierre believes you in manoeuvres. Don't tell him anything. Never. I promise. - Yesterday, I tried to kill myself. - I say. Don't give up, honey. I would die without you. You should have heard them, my so-called friends. I couldn't believe it. And when Henry lied... Ch�ri. - You are innocent, you will win. - It's time. Just give us a minute. Leave her. - Hello. - Rest. The State is happy, the press too. They say we were quick, firm and fair. We need confessions. As long as he proclaims his innocence, the case can resurface at any time. It is a danger for the army. - But he refuses to confess. - I say. You have to explain to him that if he confesses, his exile will be less painful. If he refuses, It could become unpleasant. - Let him know. - Yes sir. Think about the happiness of your wife, your family. Yes, think about your family. You could live normally in Martinique or another charming destination. It is enough to confess what we already know. You are a German agent, and we can understand that. Let's call it... a temporary absence, perhaps. I can't confess what I didn't do. This is your answer to General Mercier. Oui. I hope you realize that you will end your days on Devil's Island. They are ready. Sorry. Captain Lauth of Major Henry's office. He is absent and it comes from our contact at the German Embassy. I thought you must see this. "I await more details on the matter than you have provided. "Write to me whether or not I pursue relations with the house of HFA." I do not understand anything. It must be a code, but look at the address. "Major Ferdinand Esterhazy, 74e..." - A French officer? - Absolutely. We wrote this to the embassy, ​​but without sending it, notre contact l'a intercept�. Esterhazy... I know this name, but from where? Of course, I have his transfer request in my office. Don't say anything until I call the minister. Well sir. They are identical. La m�me�criture. Here comes the medical press. A dangerous duo. Be careful, Clémenceau will take advantage of the situation. Strange how the misery of others attracts crowds. - We're no better, we're here too. - As professional observers. I congratulate you on this remarkable investigation. - Thank you, General. - But the Dreyfus affair is closed. Close? We just found the spy. We will take care of it in due time. But we must distinguish that from the Dreyfus affair. It's impossible. Dreyfus was disgraced in public and jailed on spurious evidence. For me, Dreyfus is a spy. Even if the trial was not fair. General, you must stop this circus. There's nothing I need to do. You refuse to reopen the file? That's right. It's our duty. Our duty is to the army. The honor of the French army worth more than a soldier. I have never heard an officer speak like that. Don't tell anyone. I'm taking the Esterhazy case. Rompez. Major Picquart wants to be transferred to the front. - Prepare his mission order. - Good. Au Q.G. � Alger ? No, in Tunisia. He wants to be on the front line. Well sir. It's fascinating. Look at this woman, disfigured by hatred. Alfred Dreyfus. You are not worthy to bear arms. We degrade you in the name of the people of France. Nothing would have happened if it wasn't for you. Or for your journal. It's extraordinary. It would be interesting if he was innocent, wouldn't it? Justice cannot be so blind. I wonder. Soldiers! On ad�grad� an innocent. Longue... vie... to France! I am innocent ! Long live France ! Long live France ! I am innocent. I am innocent. I am innocent. I am innocent. You should have seen it. Don't tell me. You would have been proud of him. I was. When they broke his sword, he shouted, "I'm innocent." "Vive la France !" They broke his sword. Il r�p�tait : "Vive la France !" Even those who had come to hate him respected him. I entrust this to you, you are my lawyer. I can get killed in Africa. If that happens, give it to the President of the Republic. It explains how... the crimes imputed to Dreyfus are the work of officer Esterhazy. Esterhazy was a German agent. And how the lawsuit is based on false evidence. It's all in there? - Yes. - We must act. - I'm your lawyer and... - I'm a soldier. I cannot challenge my superiors. So quit. It takes too much courage. I cannot accept. - Why ? - How to keep such a secret? Why help injustice? I'm a lawyer, not a soldier. I must not obey blindly. Let's find a compromise. Don't show it until I die. But if you feel the need to act, show it to whoever you want. I can count on your discretion. As long as I am a soldier, my name must not be mentioned. It's quite dishonorable. In my opinion, you are mistaken, but I will execute. Alright, I'm going to fight. I'm doing better than that poor guy on Devil's Island. - How is he ? - He's going crazy, poor thing. No one talks to him, so he talks to himself. He complains that no one writes to him. It seems that he received a letter a day for a year. But he can't read them. Some mail ? No courier. What day is it ? What month ? What year? Who am I ? Nobody knows. Nobody answers. The silence. I'm Alfred Dreyfus, I believe. Soldier, say something. Or else you talk, but I'm deaf and I don't know. Or I'm dead and I don't know. Good night, soldier. If it's night. I have love Lucie, once again the day is coming to an end. I don't know how long I've been here. Nobody speaks. I am alone. Each day is a century of silence to be endured. Physical pain is nothing. I aspire to only one thing. Let them give me the honor that I have never sullied. I live because you convinced me that innocence always ends up triumphing. I don't just pray for my own salvation, but for that of the children, and yours too. Kiss them for me. And a thousand kisses for you, in this letter that I cannot write. This letter that I cannot send. Ton �poux. Alfred. Jeanne. Stay calm. You are full of knots. You come home early, darling. What is Devil's Island? Who told you about it? A boy said daddy was over there for all time. - He's coming home, right? - Of course. He says it's a bad place. Jeanne, go get your new velvet ribbon. I'll go upstairs and finish your hair. One. I'll show you where your father is. Here is France. There, the Atlantic Ocean. And there, at the very bottom. See that little dot? This is Devil's Island. It is a beautiful place. With beautiful beaches, flowers and palm trees. Dad is very happy there. Why does he stay so long? He has a lot of work for the army. He writes to me every day. He always asks after you. Come, Peter. I would like to talk to mom. How did he know? A school boy. It had to happen. For me, everyone had forgotten about Alfred. I would say no. Looked. Evad� ? - Lucy. - Where is he? Still on Devil's Island. I made this up. The case was closed. The worst would be if people forget about Alfred. And they did. That's what they wanted. Oui. Friends in England printed this notice. Senator Scheurer is expecting us. He always believed that Alfred was innocent. And the file is reopened. One. OK. Madame Dreyfus, come in. - M. Dreyfus. - S�nateur. - Sit down. - Thanks. Mme Dreyfus. Good. - That's a nice shot. - I hope so. The case will go to the Senate next week. Good. But most importantly, Mr. Lebois brought it to me. Madame Dreyfus, I am the lawyer and the friend of an officer who has proof of your husband's innocence. - A proof ? - Great. - We can see it ? - Impossible, he's in Africa. - Why didn't he say anything before? - He was ordered to. He will speak? I'm afraid he won't disobey his superiors. I don't understand. Mr. Lebois can use his information as he sees fit, without harming the officer. Upon discovering his escape, I decided to act. My friend discovered the real spy. Major Esterhazy. The army has the evidence, but they won't let it go. The army will have to take them out if we accuse them. We are with you. And this time you will have help. We need all the help we can get. Sorry for the disguise. It's nothing. I wanted to see you. And this court martial. What does she have in store for me? You will be protected. It would harm the army if you were charged. I admit that it reassures me. After the trial, you will have to leave the army. After that, I advise you to leave the country. - Why ? - Better off after what you did. You're in no position to show off. I know all of the secret evidence against Dreyfus. You falsified them. I'm not proud of myself but I believed Dreyfus guilty. I wanted to protect the army. Let me tell you one thing. If one day I become a nuisance for the army, I will kill myself. - And you ? - Why would I kill myself? Life smiles on me beautifully. And I'll be the last to put an end to it. You are despicable. And I'm an idiot. Major Picquart, when did you suspect Esterhazy of being a spy? By comparing his handwriting with that supposedly of Dreyfus, it was the same. - Major. - M�me M. Bertillon of the Paris police is of my opinion. Major Picquart ! General Mercier was before sending me to the front. I'm not talking about Dreyfus, but about Esterhazy. When did I find out that Esterhazy was a spy? I answered. You did not answer. The Dreyfus affair is closed. - How should I answer? - Sincerely. It's done, I tell you that Esterhazy is a spy. It's our job to tell if Major Esterhazy is a spy. - You have prejudices. - Yes I have against traitors. More than 300 documents prove Dreyfus' guilt. And not a single one indicates that Major Esterhazy is a traitor. Where are these documents, Major Henry? There, in the secret file. Why not show them at the Dreyfus trial? Because it concerns other states. - I would like to examine them. - Impossible. The Dreyfus affair has nothing to do with this court-martial. The Dreyfus Affair has everything to do with it. We judge Esterhazy and not Dreyfus. - I think... - You're overstepping. A secret file impossible to examine. A judge who denies the evidence. ...as with the letter sent to me by a lady from the German Embassy, I would say that our ties were hardly political. Gallantry forbids me to say his name. My enemies... and the friends of the traitor Dreyfus decided to overturn the verdict and hold myself accountable. I am an honest Frenchman, devoted to his country. And all I could say in my defense... is also true... that I am innocent. Major Picquart. Madame. Thanks for what you have done. It was a small thing. I would like to introduce you to Georges Clémenceau - and Emile Zola. - Pleased. Mme Dreyfus, Mathieu Dreyfus, Major Picquart. They are with us. After today, more than ever. This Esterhazy is one of the finest liars in all creation. And his authority, his composure. He's a genius. - Major Picquard. - What is it, Beno�t? D�sol�, but on the orders of General Mercier, I arrest you. What are you accusing him of? It's military. I'm the vice-president of the Senate... Follow me, Major. Very well. Merci, s�nateur. Maybe we should let it go. We can't sacrifice our friends. Drop now? Never ! It's not about your brother anymore, but of the whole of France. Whether we want it or not. We are not going to stop now, we are going to attack. My diary, Zola's audience. We will bring the whole world together. And the world will support us. Appeal to the world. Tackle. He is late. Do you know why he brought us here? No idea. Bonjour. Bonjour. Hello, dear conspirators. Our novelist savors the drama. We suffer and he nonchalantly turns the pages. Turn the pages ? Better than that. I wrote them down. - A letter. - Whose ? In the world. And you are going to publish it. I see. - We'll go to jail. - More than likely. The general. - General Mercier. - Yes. Approach. Have you read this? Very quickly. This Zola put us in a delicate position. In what, sir? In what ? General, you are publicly accused of forgery, of incitement to revolt, and of breaking the law. Do crummy novelists rule France? No, but this novelist makes our task very difficult. I suggest we incarcerate him. "Bring Dreyfus back from Devil's Island." "Dreyfus is innocent." Can I launch the soldiers? I clean everything in 5 min. No, no soldiers. "Dreyfus est innocent." Gentlemen, this sentence haunts us all. A common officer's court-martial divides the country and shakes the world. Our military justice is a real scandal. In two days I was called by Queen Victoria, the US President and the German Emperor. The opinion of foreigners should not concern us. General, let me speak. The Prime Minister and I have studied the Dreyfus file. Strange things happened to us. The evidence has been tampered with, as testified by Major Picquart. - Major Picquart is unreliable. - Don't interrupt me again. Let's get to the point, the reason for this meeting. The investigation revealed to us that Major Henry tampered with the evidence, and he confessed this morning. I know nothing about forgery. I know that Dreyfus is a traitor. You have always been clear on this point. I also believed he was a German agent. But thanks to your schemes, his trial was illegal. Do you question military justice? I doubt her and I judge your overall handling of the case incomp�tente et ill�gale. Can I withdraw? You can not. I think, and the Prime Minister agrees, that Dreyfus must return and have a new trial. His trial will be one of the fairest. If he is innocent. There is no "if", Mr. President. One day, in a few months perhaps, Germany will attack. You will have to be ready. But if our people distrust their army, we are lost. An army cannot fight without its people behind it and I warn you that if Dreyfus is found not guilty, the army is guilty. If the army is guilty, France is defenseless. Make your choice. A man... or the nation. Your opinion has been heard, General. And we agree to bring Dreyfus home and offer him a new trial. Prepare the order, General. Captain Dreyfus. Captain Dreyfus. You return to France by order of the President of the Republic You will have another trial. Give him some clothes. The boat leaves at the first hour. Good luck, Dreyfus. At home. At home. Mathieu... Have I changed a lot? Of course not. It's been five years. You can come in. Be the first to. Alfred. I almost forgot. Every day, every minute, I was thinking of your return. It's not easy to find the words. Do not try. Not now, darling. Here is all I want. Always the same. And everything will be as before. I am old. But no. You live without a watch or a mirror. With no one to talk to. You are getting old. We have years ahead of us. Oui. I pray for that. Alfred. Mathieu. You've gained some weight. It's good to see you again. �a va. I'm not used to it anymore. Sometimes the fever makes me sick. It's nothing. Let him rest. Don't leave me. Tell me about this trial. This new trial. uh well... It looks good. Most agree on Esterhazy's guilt. Esterhazy? Who is this ? The real spy. He is in England. Major Picquart has discovered everything. Picquart ? Picquart. Do you remember ? Your friend from the office. I had no friends. You have thousands of friends. People we don't even know. People who think you're innocent. We're going to win this time. I think I would die if I were to go back there. You won't go back there. November 16, 1896, General Mercier and I agreed that Esterhazy Was the author of the list and... A moment. Were there any witnesses to the scene? Non. So it's your word against the general's as to this specific fact. The general understood that we had been mistaken. He found it inappropriate to reopen the file. In the initial court martial, Colonel Sandherr prepared a dossier of evidence against Dreyfus. After examining the evidence, I concluded that Dreyfus was guilty. I don't think I was wrong. What was the nature of this evidence? I haven't looked into this case for a while. We have work besides Captain Dreyfus. Sure, but there are some things you need to remember. A pile of letters between the Italian and German attachés. In his confession, Major Henry says he falsified most of them. Which marked you the most? I'm a soldier, not an expert in forgery. A great soldier, whom this affair seems to disturb. Yes, it is disturbing to see his word doubted. Sorry for the lack of tact, but your statements often contradict Major Picquart. M. Picquart. - He's no longer an officer. - Of course. So, 21 December 1894, have you prepared a secret memo for the judges of the Dreyfus trial ordering them to conclude treason? No way. Prior to his arrest, Major Henry confessed delivered your instructions in person. - It wasn't instructions. - But you handed them over. Do you admit giving them a secret memo? What I say to my subordinates is none of your business. General, you are under oath. Have you communicated with the Dreyfus jury, the 21 d�cembre 1894 ? Yes or no ? I will not answer. You don't seem to realize you're being charged. Accus� ? You use that word with me? I remind you that I am the accuser and that this man is the accused. Do not forget it. I am shocked to see my word questioned. Shocked to see the French judging their army. This man is guilty of treason. That's all. Dreyfus a �t� d�lib�r�ment utilis� to smear the Republic and the army. I address the nation. Alfred Dreyfus is a spy. He betrayed his country. If I had any doubt about his guilt, I would recognize on the spot that I was wrong. I would say to you, Alfred Dreyfus, that I was wrong. So say it. Alfred Dreyfus, you are a German spy. You know I'm innocent. Calm down, captain. He has to admit it. It is your duty. Did you have the artillery manual of 1893 in July of this year? - Nope. - I can not hear. Non. No, I do not think so. It's one or the other. Yes or no ? Sorry, I don't remember. I do not think so. I did not have it. I'm sure. I think... Were you present at the German military maneuvers and March 1892? Yes or no ? No, I... I have never been to any maneuvers in Germany. Why do you hesitate? My question is very clear. Were you there or not? I don't understand, sorry. When the family factory burned down, did you get the insurance? I do not know anything about it. I do not know. I have a fever. Sorry, I was a poor witness. Alfred. We got an unofficial message from the president. He promises that if you are found guilty, and you will be, you will be pardoned. Graci� ? Know that by accepting grace, you accept the army's verdict. You will remain a traitor. As you have already suffered, the government is showing charity. It's a perfect compromise for them. Will I be able to rejoin the army? Reinstate? Do you want to go back there? After what they did to you. They did what they thought was right. They really thought I was a spy. In their place, I would have done the same. I don't want to argue with you. But Clémenceau, Zola and the others hope you will fight, that you will refuse pardon. What do you think ? You have to decide for yourself. What a dilemma. Devil's Island or the freedom of a traitor. Alfred, if we fight, we'll win. We will oppose the verdict and we will appeal. If you had been on Devil's Island, to become less than nothing. Nothing at all. Without being dead. To be alone. Without Lucia. Sorry, but I won't fight. I can't. I'm going home. I accept grace. When will you put your uniform back on? By returning to active duty. It lasts really long. Do you think you'll be a general? Well, you never know. - I want to become a general. - Me too. And go to Devil's Island. You will take me away, say? Of course. Tell me again. So, let's see. Children, dinner is ready. - I study the Battle of Austerlitz. - Go study your plate. I'm soon running out of stories. One day, I will have to say to Pierre: "Your father is a pardoned traitor." "Because of your father, you won't join the army." "You are the son of a life prisoner." - You are free. - Free ? Two years in this house. Two years of lawyers. Two years of lynching. You are a symbol, said Clémenceau. The new France, says Zola. A spy, says Mercier, who betrayed his country. I am not a man, but a cause, a party, a flag. I have no life. - And neither are you. - I do. I should have refused the pardon and gone to Devil's Island. - Or in England. - Shut your mouth. At least you'd be fine and not here with me. I do not care. You are everything I want. If I go out, I risk starting a riot. So we stay here lying to the kids every day because I dare not say to my son: "Forget the army, change your name, deny your father "and there you will live as a man and not as a monster." Don't say that. Major Esterhazy. Are you Major Esterhazy? At your service. Except I'm no longer major. Yes I know. So you were in London. And what do you want from me? M'amuser. I've been writing for a few months and I thought it might be of interest to an editor like you. I need money. My wife is sick. My business is not looking good. I have nothing left to sell except� ceci. I know you by reputation. I'm not interested in publishing a traitor's defense. Did I mention defense? I just talked about money. And I bet you'll pay for it. Alfred Dreyfus, in the name of the President of the Republic, I make you Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. Looks like we got away with it, Major Dreyfus. Merci, g�n�ral Picquart.
