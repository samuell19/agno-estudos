What's going on here? Nothing. Well, where is everybody? What you expect? A brass band? Sure. Why not? Now, you know, folks around here don't take to loggers. Now, look here, mister. Every place we go, people are happy to see US. We spend money like water. We'll put this town on the map. Or take it off. Jim, I don't think that guy likes US. Monty, this place looks like a ghost town. Lots of timber, though. That's all we care about. Get rid of this. You heard what he said. Get rid of it. Sure. Don't worry about him, partner. He's a little rough, maybe, but, uh... I can take care of him. All right, but he's your problem. Blackie! Yeah, boss? Start unloading. All right, you Jacks. Start getting the big stuff off of here. Unload that end. I'll get the horses and the groceries. I'll go with you. No. Stay here and set up camp. Whatever you say. I'll meet you at the gap. If you get in trouble, let me know. I'll come quick. Don't you worry. I'll yell. Hey, Jim, see if you can find some good women and bad whiskey. How about the other way around? Good, sure. Anything you say, partner! But loggers are loggers, and we don't want them here in deepwell. Ah, don't bust a gut, judd. We'll take care of them. She'd look awful pretty in pink. I don't know, Jane. Aunt Sarah said red, so red it better be. Well... Oh, give me some candy sticks for my wife. (Storekeeper) Why, certainly. Thought you wanted some goods. Well, that was pretty good, wasn't it? Janey? Yes, pa? Will you wait on Mrs. Gordon? Bert can take care of himself. Yes, pa. (Softly) See you tonight. He's in here often enough. Mark my words, Sam. We're in trouble-- real trouble-- if we want to keep that timber. Here you are, Sam. $20. Thanks, judd. I'll have Jane deliver it sometime this afternoon. Hello. Hello. I want 35 dozen eggs, 8 sides of bacon, 14 pounds of coffee. The rest is on the list. Yeah. Well, now... That's a lot of food, mister. It's a lot of men. That will all be gone in a week. I might not have that much bacon or coffee. Give me as much as you can. We're making camp at the gap. Will you deliver it? Sorry. No deliveries. But you delivered for him. The law says I got to sell to you. It says nothing about delivering. All right. I'll pick it up. Any law about information? Well, now, that's according to what you want to know. Where's the livery stable? Few doors down. Turn in the alley. Thanks. Hello? Anybody home? Oh, hello. Nice horse. Best in town. Want to rent him? I need about 30 of them. Got a lot of logging to do. I'm sorry, mister. These horses are already hired. You rented them pretty fast. Look, mister, I ain't got nothing against you personally. It's just that my horses are particular who they work for. You know where I can hire some? Well, there's a lot of ranchers around here. You want to try, you're welcome. Yeah. I'll bet. Nice workhorses. Best there are. Just got them shod. They for rent? No. They belong to the Riley ranch. We've got lots of them out there. How about taking me out there? Uh-uh. I'd get skinned alive if I brought a logger out there. Well, if you're afraid. Wait, mister. I'm not afraid of nobody. You want a ride, you just climb up here. Well, thanks. Nice place. Runs all the way to piety mountain. Riley does all right. How long you been a ranch hand? I'm not a ranch hand. Aunt Sarah says I'm too young. All I do is run errands-- kid stuff. Well, I thought sure enough you were a ranch hand. The barn's up ahead. Where will I find the boss? Probably in the corral. (Shouting) Give him more rein! Don't tighten, or it'll throw you! Whoa. Thanks for the ride. Aw, come on! Come on! Give it more rein! More rein, do you hear? Do you hear me? More re--rein! Ride him, aunt Sarah! Who pushed me? Nobody pushed you. Well, then, don't stand there gawking. If you didn't push me, at least help me up. Sarah, you didn't give that fence enough rein! Sure, aunt Sarah. You were riding him too tight. Go on! Get out of here! That's it! We'll take him for you. You did good. He's going to be all right. How'd I do, aunt Sarah? Oh, you did it. You did it! What a ride! Your old man would have been proud of you today. Oh, you're a holy mess. You're too dirty for brushing. I'll fill a tub of water for you. Hello. Hello. Mighty fine riding. Thank you. Nice spread you've got here. I'd like to talk to Riley. Start talking. You're Riley? What about it? Well, I thought I was going to see an old man. You see...Well, my name is Jim Hadley. Laura Riley. Howdy. Miss? Miss, but please don't call me miss Riley. It sounds like a schoolteacher. Just Laura or Riley will do. Well, the way you handle that horse, you sure know your business. I don't believe I know yours. I'd like to hire some horses. How many will you need? About 30. That's an awful lot of horses. What do you want them for? See, I'm a logger. Get off my land. I told you to go, or would you rather be helped off? Look, I'm a logger. I'm not a thief. To US, it's all the same thing. I don't know what you mean. Look. There she is-- piety mountain. Lot of wood on her. We'd like her to stay that way. If you log the timber off that mountain, there won't be a blade of grass left in this valley. The first rain will wash away the topsoil. No topsoil, no grass. No grass, no cattle. It's not our problem. We've got a Grant. You'll ruin every rancher in this valley. Does that make any difference to you? Sorry. If you won't give me the horses, I'll get them someplace else, but those trees come down. I wouldn't be too sure. People can get mighty stubborn when you push them into a corner. That goes both ways. Well, we know where we stand, anyway. Good-bye, Mr. Hadley. What did he want? He's a logger. Well, he's trespassing. Mr. Hadley. I'll drive you back. Bert. You're not driving him anyplace. But I brought him out here. You're not driving him anywhere. He's got no way of getting back. It's all right, Bert. Thanks, anyway. Thanks for your hospitality. Any time. What good did that do US? I'm trying to protect your interests. I don't want you to fight with them. We'll have to find some other way. All right. But I got a feeling there is no other way. Don't put that sugar on the wet ground! Cookie, where do you want this water? Put it in the water barrel! Well, make up your mind! What about the girl? Oh, it isn't her, monty. It's the townspeople. They don't want US. Why? We're not bothering anybody. They claim if we cut their timber, it would ruin their watershed. So what? Our job's cutting trees, not ranching. We got the tiger by the tail. And we won't let it go. We got every nickel we ever made tied up on this railroad contract. We got nine weeks to deliver that lumber, and that's just what we're going to do. Right? Right. Good. Now, uh...Tell me, partner, uh... What about the girl? Who is she? Is she pretty, maybe? Not bad. Her name's Riley. Riley? You sure she's a girl? Unless they're making shirts different these days. Ha ha ha! Timber! Timber! Timber! (Wood splitting) Timber! Timber! Timber! (Sawing) Hi, there, Mr. Hadley! Hi, Bert! Timber! Ha! Whoa! Whoa. Mr. Hadley. Oh, hello. Well, thank you. Gee, this logging business is real great. We think it is. Hey, monty. Be right with you, Jim. All right, Vince! Down the hill! Timber! Timber! Timber! Timber! All right, you men! Limber up! What are you doing, Mr. Hadley? Lining up the fall of a tree. Gosh. Blackie! Favor the left wedge. All right, boss. Timber! Timber! Timber! Timber! Hey, monty! How's it going? Great, Jim! Just great. I've never seen such good timber. And the men-- whew. They sure work hard. Hey. Saturday night, we buy the bottles, huh? All right. And maybe I'll meet this, uh... This girl Riley, huh, boy? Sure, Mr. Monty. You watch me, partner. She meets me, and, uh... We get all the horses we want. First, you tackle that tree. Come on, son. Mr. Hadley, would you give me a job? But you've got a job. But I want to be a lumberjack, like you. What about your aunt Sarah? She's not really my aunt. She and Riley took me in after my pa died. What about your mother? I never knew her. Anyway, I figured if I can make some real money, I could pay Riley and aunt Sarah back for my keep. I'll bet you have. I'd sure feel better if I could make money of my own, be able to take care of them in case something happened. You understand how a man feels. Go home before Riley comes and gets you. Don't worry. Riley wouldn't be caught dead around loggers. Thanks, Mr. Hadley, but I still want to be a logger. There it is, Riley. Take a good look. Come next spring, your cattle will be eating mud. Go see judd and the others. Tell them we'll meet tonight. We'd be no better than they are. Let's fight fire with fire. Wait a minute. Either we stop them now or end up in a ghost town. We know, Clay, but there must be some legal way. They've got a government Grant. Our only hope is to stall them until it runs out. I don't know about that. That seems dangerous to me. (Crowd muttering) We'd better decide fast. Sheriff Taylor may pay US a visit. Well, judd? I'm for it. How about you, Brandt? Sounds good. Evans? Count me in. Sam? We've got as much to lose as you. If your ranches fail, our stores do. Tell US what to do. I'll handle that. We've got to figure out when. Bert hangs around their camp. According to him, the whole crew is coming to town Saturday night. Good. That's it, then. The dance is Saturday. Shall we cancel it? No, that's even better. It will work for US. Everybody will be in the town hall, no one in the way. Good. Very good. If it's all settled, we'd better break this up. And keep it quiet. Let's go. I got a feeling this is one dance we'll never forget. I promise you, judd, neither will Mr. Hadley. * oh, I love a girl * * and she loves me * * ba ba ba ba ba * * yeah, I love a girl * * and she loves me * * ba ba ba ba ba * * oh, gee whizz whilikens golly gee * * gee whizz whilikens golly gee * * gee whizz whilikens golly gee * * oh, I love a girl * * and she loves me * * ba ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba ba ba * * is my baby sweet? * * as sugar candy, apple pie * * when our two lips meet * * ooh, yeah, I just sigh * * gee whizz whilikens golly gee * * she's the prettiest thing you'll see * * gee whizz whilikens golly gee * * oh, I love a girl * * and she loves me * * ba ba ba ba ba * * yeah, I love a girl * * and she loves me * * ba ba ba ba ba * * ah, she's so heavenly * * and a real live, walking, talking dream * * she just touches me * * and, ooh, yeah, I just scream * * gee whizz whilikens golly gee * * we're going steady now, yes, sirree * * gee whizz whilikens golly gee * * I love a girl * * and she loves me * * ba ba ba ba ba * * yeah, I love a girl * * and she loves me * * ba ba ba ba ba * * ba ba ba ba ba * * ba-ah ba ** Now play something lively!

Then let's go outside. Show me how glad you really are. Bert. Oh, this is wonderful, Amos. I feel like I'm 18 all over again. Well, don't get any younger, Sarah. I couldn't stand it. Oh! What's the matter, partner? We're ahead of schedule, making lots of money. Why don't you have fun for a change? Things are going too smoothly. Ah, you worry too much. Me, I don't care-- not on Saturday night, anyway. All right. Let's have fun. Now you're talking, Jim! (Music ends) Thank you, Sam. Oh, it's been right pleasurable, miss Laura. Come on, Sam. It'll take the poor thing a week to get over your tromping on her feet. I haven't had a chance to tell you how beautiful you look tonight. Thank you, sir. Well, it's true. You know, Riley, you wouldn't have to worry about those loggers if you'd let me take care of you. We agreed not to talk about that. You agreed. I didn't. Please, Clay, not tonight. I thought girls liked to be told when somebody loves them. Next time the music starts, you tell me. What's happened to the music? Come on, Archie! Archie, come on, before my legs stiffen up. Tune her up and let her go! * cry timber, timber * * timber, I cry * * if a tree don't fall on me * * I'll live till I die * * timber, timber * * timber, I cry * * if a tree don't fall on me * * I'll live till I die... * it's those loggers-- heading for the saloon, I'll bet!

Ow! Monty, set 'em up! You don't care who you serve, do you, Roy? You're not very friendly people, are you? Maybe if I knock your heads together, you'll be more friendly. (Jim) Monty! (Laughter) Hey, bartender! Set 'em up for all of US. 21 bottles. No glasses-- just the bottles. Attaboy! Yay! Come on. Come on. (Accordion music playing) Attaboy, monty! Come on. Come on. If you want more money, let me know. Give me a hand. Yeah! Here you are, Lee. Blackie. Ho, Charlie! Hey, Joe! Harry! Hey, partner! It's Saturday night! Boys are on the prowl, but don't worry. I never worry, Mr. Hadley. When I do, I'll start wearing my gun. Here, have a drink. Nope. Haven't had a drink for 10 years-- bad for my liver. Besides, I don't like it. You don't like US, either. I like everybody till they start breaking the law. That's when people don't like me. We won't be breaking the law, I promise you. That's good enough for me, Mr. Hadley. The saloon closes 2:00. Quiet! Quiet, everybody! Shh! Listen. (Banjo playing) Hey, come here. Where is that music coming from? From the dance. They've got a dance every Saturday night. They have? Where's there's dancing, there's women! What are we waiting for? Let's go! Hold it! Aw, come on, Jim. You're not going to stop the men from having fun, are you? Come on, partner. What are you worried about? Nothing's going to happen. All right. Go ahead, boys. Yay! Yay! Ha ha ha! Ah, Jim... We'll see you later. May I have this next dance, please? Certainly. What did you do that for? You didn't say please! Ha ha ha! How's that for being a gentleman, boss? Come on. (Man) Timber! The nerve of them. They're coming here! That's what they think. Come on, men! Why can't they come? They won't hurt nothing. I'm going to see they don't! I don't want you to start anything. Is that clear? What's wrong with them? They look good to me. Anything in pants would look good to you. Go on! Get inside there. Hold it! (Men quiet down) What do you want? We came to the dance. This is a private dance, Mr. Hadley, or do you have a government permit for that, too? I'll tell you plainer. You ain't welcome here! All right, boys. You heard what miss Riley said. Let's go. They'll catch Clay! Stop them. I said let's go. Maybe they're afraid the women will find out what real men are like. We can find out right now. Timber! Timber! Timber! Please, miss, don't do that. Pardon me, miss, but you're going to hurt somebody. Jim, every time I'm with you, you get into a fight. Sorry. Ah! Timber! Ha ha ha ha! Timber! Timber. Hey, boss, this is more fun than dancing! Ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha! Timber! Clay better hurry. I ain't gonna last much longer. Look out, Mr. Hadley! Ow! Thanks, Bert. After you, Eddie. Timber! Timber! (Explosions) (Man) Sounds like it came from the gap! Hyah! Hyah! They blocked the logging road. It's our road, Jim. It was our road. Ha ha! Ha ha ha! What do you know? A landslide. It ruined the logging road! Now, ain't that too bad? Somebody dynamited it. Somebody? Who? I've got a pretty good idea. What are you going to do about it, sheriff? What do you suggest I do? You got no proof. Should I lock up everybody in town? Yeah, or let US handle it our way. Easy, monty. We'll find another road. There's only one other road, mister. Good. Then we'll use it. That's up to miss Riley. The road runs right through her ranch. And that means there is no other road. All right. If they want to play rough, that suits me fine. We're not going to let people walk all over US. You know what we should do? Get guns and storm that girl's road. What do you want to do, fight the whole town? Yeah! That's just what I want to do. Tell me, what do you want to do? Get an easement through her property. What happens to our payroll while we are waiting for this easement? And what happens if we don't get it? We'll find a way. We stick around and wait for the easement. Are those your orders, boss? Monty, I am not the boss. We're partners. Not the way you're running this, we're not! You know what I'm going to do? Go into town and get good and drunk-- two weeks' worth! Jeez! Monty, look! Whew! You think we'll ever get a road through here? Worth a try. I don't know. If we don't get that easement, we're as dead as a flea on a hound dog's whiskers. Hey, men! Come on, boys! Hold it! Hey! Hey, you fellas! Get over there. All right, knock it off. We got enough trouble. You heard him. Break it up! Get back to work, all of you. He started the fight. Can't you control your crew? They're all getting edgy trying to build a road through this country, knowing it can't even be done. I'll decide that. We're beginning to get on each other's nerves. You and monty don't hardly ever talk to each other no more. We ought to pack up and get out. Forget it, blackie. Tell them to go back to camp. I'm going down to the station. The boss is getting kind of edgy, ain't he? Who asked you? Mr. Burroughs. (Meow) Mr. Burroughs. (Meow) Burroughs! (Meow) Burroughs! Oh. No telegram as yet, Mr. Hadley. Nice day. Hello, Mr. Hadley. You still with US? We'll be around awhile. Nice day, Mr. Hadley. Nice day. Nice day, Mr. Hadley. Nice day. Mighty nice. Why, howdy, Mr. Hadley. Well, right nice day. Anything I can do for you? Yes. I'll take two slabs of bacon, a sack of potatoes, and 5 pounds of coffee. That's not much of an order. That all? That's it. It looks like you'll be leaving US. For the life of me, I can't figure why you stuck around so long. It's because of nice people like you, Mr. Peterson. Oh, come now. There's no hard feelings. It's a big man knows how to lose. It's a bigger man who knows how to win. I'll get my stuff in the morning. You want your stuff delivered, Mr. Hadley? No extra charge. Ha ha ha ha! (Men laughing) Hello. You going to crow, too? Mr. Hadley, I didn't cry before, and I'm not going to crow now. I merely said hello... And now, good-bye. Riley, I'd like to talk to you. About what? How much is your ranch worth? I don't know. No one's ever tried to buy it. I'm trying. If you can't beat them, buy them. Is that it? I'm disappointed in you, Hadley. You're wasting your time. I got a lot of time to waste. Anything else you'd like to talk about? 10,000? 15,000? You're a very stubborn man, Hadley. No more than you are or that foreman of yours. Clay is very loyal. He must be, to do a thing like that. Like what? Blow up a mountain. Good-bye, miss Riley. Hadley! Wait a minute. You in a hurry to get back? All I've got is time. Would you like to take a ride with me? It's about 8 miles from here, on the other side of the Ridge. What's up there? You'll see. Well? Well, I like surprises. Good. Don't look like your partner's too worried. He'd better be. I'm not going to wait much longer. Look around you, Hadley. This was once a thriving town, just like deepwell. It was called green Meadow. That's funny, isn't it? I don't think so. Clay, my foreman, was born and raised in this town. He wanted to be a rancher like his father before him, but he never got the chance. The loggers came and stripped the trees off every mountain around here. They destroyed the watershed, but, of course, that didn't matter to them. The first rains buried this town under an avalanche of mud and water, and every time it rains, the same thing happens. We don't want that to happen to our town, Mr. Hadley, and we'll do everything we can to stop you. You made your point. Now I'll make mine. I didn't make the rules, and I didn't use dynamite to carry them through. We're fighting for our lives. You can't hate US for that. I don't hate you. Where have you been, Riley? We've been getting kind of nervous. There's a light in your eye looks like you've been drinking. What have you been up to, anyway? I've been out riding with Mr. Hadley. What? You're a fool to go riding alone anywhere with him. Something might have happened. Nothing happened. Come on. Hold it up there. I knew you couldn't do it. Let's see you try her, then. O.k. Hey, Jim! Jim! We got it, Jim! You were right again, partner. I take my hat off to you. There's the easement, signed and sealed. We did it your way--legal. No shooting, no fighting. Just the way you wanted it. How do you like it? Fine. We're back in business again. Right, partner? Right. Hey, what's the matter, Jim? You still mad at me? Sure, I lost my head, but now I apologize. I apologize, Jim. What more do you want? Let's get the job done. Get the men rolling. You betcha, partner! I'll have the sheriff take US through the Riley property tomorrow morning. All right, you guys! We're going to knock that forest right down to the roots! Yay! Yay! All right, sheriff... Open the gate. We're going through. I hope there's no trouble. All right, boys. Come on. (Whistles) (Whistles) (Whistles) Nice and legal, huh? We should have brought our guns along. Blackie, clear the road. (Blackie) Come on, you Jacks. Let's get at this. (Gunshots) Let that tree alone. What about it, sheriff? Like I told you last night, Riley, he's got a good legal paper. Let me see it. It's perfectly legal, every single word of it. It doesn't say you have the right to cut trees on my property. Show me, sheriff. Riley's right. You can use existing roads, but there's nothing here about cutting trees on her property. You can't stop US with a cheap trick like this. I'll stop you any time, any way I can, Mr. Hadley. How long are we going to let them push US around? Monty, take the men back to camp. Like hell I will. Let's settle this once and for all. I'm doing the best I can. All right, boss. You do what you think is best. I'll do what I think is best. Hyah! We tried it your way. Clear the road in the morning. We're coming through. Mr. Hadley, you're on my property. Blackie. Monty back yet? No. He was all steamed up. He's probably in the saloon working it off. I hope so. He should have listened to you. We wouldn't have had a chance this morning. We will tomorrow. Here's how we'll work it. Monty will take five men and plant the dynamite. You take your group up above the road. Who's going to take the wagons through? Me. How many guns we got? Oh, 11 rifles, a couple of pistols. Get everything ready. We start tomorrow. Looks like we're going to try it monty's way after all. Yeah. I better look the hothead up. Mr. Hadley, I want to talk to you. Little late for that. It's never too late to stop people from killing each other. All right. I'm sorry about what happened at the ranch this morning. If you won't uphold the law, we will. No matter who gets hurt? No matter. I don't condone lawbreaking of any kind, but there are laws and laws-- some big and some small. Occasionally, it's better to break a small law to keep a big one. That's a very pretty speech. Why don't you tell Riley that in the morning? Now, look, Hadley, at least try to understand these people. This is their land, their homes, everything. They have every moral right. But I've got a contract. And you still intend to force your way through? Yes. All right. I'll try to talk to Riley. You hold your men off. I'll need a little time. You've got it-- until noon tomorrow. Mr. Hadley, for a logger, you sure don't know much about roots. That's not what you said before. I don't care what I said to you before. A woman has a right to change her mind. If you go with those loggers, it's all off. I didn't say I was going for sure. I said I was thinking of going. My mind ain't made up. If you keep shouting and nagging, you'll make it up for me. Don't you call me a nag. Do what you want. For all I care, you can go to...Alaska! Maybe I will. You ain't seen nothing, Bert. Wait till you're married. Oh, you! It's all your fault. You can go with him any time you like, but if you do, I never want to see you again. What was that all about? Aw, women. One minute they're full of smiling and understanding. The next minute they're snarling and snapping at you. All I told her was I might go with you. That's what started it all. You going with US? I don't know anymore. With aunt Sarah and Jane making such a fuss, I don't know what I want to do. Maybe I'm scared. I've never been out of this town since I was born. What would you do? I'd... I'd stay here. You would? Well, I never expected to hear you talk like that. Well, it's the women. They need you. Gee, I never thought about it that way. Better make it up with Jane. She could be right. Aw, let her stew awhile. Thanks, Mr. Hadley.

Five sticks to a tree. Right, boss. I wonder what Jim will say when he sees this road cleared. I don't care what he says. From now on, we'll do things my way. Boss! Boss, monty was back. He took all the dynamite! Did you tell him our plan? I got no chance. He was crazy. Oh, the fool. Giddy up. (Whispering) Higher. Higher. (Loudly) Will you hand me that wire? Shh! Shut up, you guys. I'm sorry. Is that ready? All set. Bring that wire over here. Hyah! Shh! Hold it, hold it. Get out of sight. Go on, go on! Whoa. He's coming up here. (Rustling) What are you doing here? Shh. Take it easy, boy. You're trying to clear the road! That's right, boy. That's just what I'm going to do. Where's Mr. Hadley? You've got no business here. Riley! Riley! Riley! Riley! Riley! Shut up, you fool. Clay. Riley! Shut up. (Punches) Riley. Clay! Get that plunger up the hill. Go on--fast! (Explosions) Monty. Monty! Ohh... Bert. Bert! Get Dr. Evans--quick! He's still in a state of shock. It might be hours. All of you better get some sleep. Mr. Hadley... I hope your timber is worth it. I don't care if he did it or not. He's their boss. If not for him, Bert might be dead now. Riley, I don't convince as easy as you, and I don't fool as easy, either. (Door shuts) I had your promise you'd wait. You still have. Your men tried to clear the road. Got proof of that? Why waste your time? He probably picked the men who did it. Or have you got a special law against loggers? Laura... I'm sorry about Bert. Why did you do it? Do what, partner? Mess things up. The road's open. That's what you wanted, isn't it? If that boy dies, there'll be a lynch mob. Nothing's going to get in my way anymore, Jim. We're moving up through that timber, and nobody's going to stop me. I'll stop you. I guess I'll have to get you out of the way. I guess you'll have to do that. All right, you guys! Nobody butts in. Nobody. Understand? This is just between you and me, partner. Stay out of this, blackie. That means you, too, Vince. (Men yelling) (Spits) You all right, boss? Yeah. Pack up, blackie. We're moving out of here. What about our timber? There are other places. I don't get it. I just don't get it. We came here to cut down trees, not kids. How's Bert? Doc Evans says he'll make it. What happened to you? Oh, a little accident in camp. Happen to find out who beat up the boy? I wouldn't know. Ease things around here for you if you did. I don't know who he is. Of course not. Well, thanks for trying, anyway. I want you to know I never thought you had anything to do with that boy getting hurt. And another thing-- if you weren't a logger, I might even get to like you. You really think so, Mr. Hadley? You bet. You'll be the best cowhand there is. You take care of him. I'll do that. I can't wait till he's well enough to whip. Scaring me like that! Good-bye, aunt Sarah. Good-bye, janey. Bye. Bye. (Bert) Bye. Women. I'm surrounded by them. Hadley. About the road. I... Forget it. We're leaving tomorrow. You're what? On the morning train. You changed your mind awfully fast, didn't you? Important things like that happen in a hurry. But I don't understand. I thought you had everything tied up in this contract. Why? I mean, why are you really leaving? I found something more important than timber. Good-bye, Hadley. Good-bye, Laura. (Gunshots) Get inside and close the door. No sweat, boss. You got a dead partner. Don't touch him. He's mine. Jim! Jim. Uh! Monty. Monty! Where are you? Monty. You don't have a chance. It's our timber, Jim. We paid for it. We're not leaving it. Nobody's going to take it away. Nobody. Monty! I'll get you sooner or later. Where are you? Monty. You can't hide forever. Listen to me. I'll give you one more chance to come out. Monty! Come on out. Riley! Ride into town. Get all the help you can. Bring my men. Get your horses to safety. Come on, men. Going to take more than men to fight that fire. We'll make a break. Where's the dynamite? What dynamite? The dynamite you used to blow up the gap. In the barn. Ed, forest fire in back of my ranch! (Clanging) Timber Blaze behind my ranch! Hadley wants you up there now. Hank, get our men out of that joint! Come on. We got a fire! Forest fire in back of my ranch! Let it burn. It will drive those loggers out. Sam, if that timber burns, it'll ruin our watershed. We need help! Hurry! Hurry, men! Come as fast as you can! Blast the tops, and we got a chance. We got to hurry. It's awful close. Make a breakthrough. We're going to dynamite. (Blackie) Get the tools, Jacks. We're cutting a break through there. Get up there and cut a coal trail. The rest of you work behind US. Come on. Monty. Monty! Monty. We're going to dynamite. Monty. Hadley! Everybody out of here. We're going to dynamite the place. All right. Everybody clear out of here! We're going to blast it. Everybody out! Everybody out. Go on. Everybody. Monty! Monty! Monty! Monty. (Coughing) It's spreading. Set her off, Clay. Monty! Hadley! Let her go, Clay! (Explosions) Monty. Monty. Jim. Monty! Jim. Jim. Jim. Monty. You fool. I'm sorry, partner. Mr. Hadley, we want to thank you. You know what that watershed means to US. After the way we've acted, you didn't have to do it. Come on, blackie. Move out. All right, you Jacks. Get on these wagons. We got a train to catch. Everybody seems mighty happy to be leaving. Everybody except you, that is. Yeah, I know. (Train whistle blows) Jim! Jim. Where are you going? With you. What about your ranch? Aunt Sarah and Bert can have it. You won't have a home. That's all right with me. Remember, I'm the boss. O.k., boss. All right, boys. Get her aboard. It looks like you got yourself a new partner. Timber! Bye. Bye! Bye. * timber, timber * * timber, I cry * * if a tree don't fall on me * * I'll live till I die * * we've said it before, and we'll say it again * * ranching's for women, and logging's for men * * timber, timber, timber, I cry * * if a tree don't fall on me * * I'll live till I die **
