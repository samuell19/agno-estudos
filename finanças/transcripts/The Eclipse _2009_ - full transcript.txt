Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. l'm going to formally launch the 11th Festival of Literature and Poetry. No messing now, Thomas. Straight to bed. Dad, a quick game of Death Troopers lV. lt's a quarter to 11:00-bed. - 10 minutes. - lt's a school night. - Tomorrow's Friday. - Tomorrow's Thursday. Go to bed. - Good night, Dad. - Good night, hon. l'll be up in five minutes to make sure you're asleep. Five minutes? Yes, you're lucky to be up this late at all. Yeah, very lucky- boring old speeches. Go on the hell up there, young lad. Lie down. Lie down. Go to sleep. Oh, yes, l'm sorry to disturb you so late. My name is Michael Farr. l have a funny question. l was just wondering if one of your residents, Malachy McNeill, is there. He mightn't have slipped out during the night? He's my father-in-law. He's there? And he's all right? Yeah, okay, good. Well, thanks very much. And again, l'm sorry for calling you so late. Okay, bye. Thanks. There's a message from Granddad on the machine. Yeah? What did he say? l don't know. Something about last night. Oh, Jesus. l forgot. l said l'd bring him with us. You'd better call him. l'll call on him later. - Are you all right with food? - Yeah. Who were you talking to last night? l wasn't talking to anybody. l was just dreaming. Were you dreaming about Mom? No. l was dreaming about how awful those sausage rolls were last night. Jeez, they were terrible. We're broadcasting this morning from Cobh... Dad, look. lt's the festival. - Whoo-hoo. - Shh. ...and it's a real honor to be joined by one of the great novelists of our time- Nicholas Holden. Thank you. Thank you. And "The White Gallows" is to be made into a movie, l see? Yes, l'm very pleased about that, actually. Starring Ralph Fiennes, no less. Whom l just adore. Don't we all? - Ugh. - Now we've lots of messages, too many to read out, congratulating you on being given the prestigious Jonathan Swift Award. Thank you. Thank you. - Hi. - Michael: Hi there. Woman #2: Doreen, no. You'll have to wait. Woman #2: Doreen, Doreen, hold on, love. Hi, Joe. Hi, Malachy. Sorry. Things are a bit mad. l totally forgot about you yesterday. There's your razors you asked me to get and your 7-Up. That's- What's that? That's the tickets to the festival. l meant to drop them up to you, but you know, things got- you know that l was all dressed up here and ready to go last night? You know that? One of the nurses tried to ring you. Yeah, l know, Malachy. l'm sorry. There's just so- l mean, l had the kids to get ready and everything. Yeah. Don't ever let them put you in a home, Michael. Here. l had a dream about you last night. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. l dreamt that you were in the house. l could have sworn you were there. l dreamt that Eleanor was here last night. - Yeah? - Yeah. And she looked like when she was just three or four maybe. l followed her out- out there into the little garden. And then l couldn't find her. l was panicking, wondering where she'd gone. And then l remembered she is gone and it's- l have those. Yeah. l know what it's like to lose your wife, Michael. lt- it's unbelievable. But when you lose a child- Jesus, it's almost like you think there can't be a God. How many are there? Hello. Hello hello hello. Hiya. Good to see you. Welcome. Welcome. Hello, welcome. Welcome. Woman: And this is professor... Hello. How are you? Hello hello. ls that them all? - l think so. - Okay, thank you. Woman: Where is Lena Morelle? Man: l was on the phone to her agent. She told me- assured me actually- - that she had already left for the airport. - She's not here. Man: What more can l do? Michael, at last. Do me a favor, nip down to the station to pick up Lena Morelle for me. Lena Morelle? l thought she was supposed to get in last night. Michael, don't you start. Um, how are you getting on? You need to make sure these measurements are exact before you cut the wood any shorter, understand? All right? Good. Sarah: Dad, l'm going to Olivia's house. - Okay, don't be out late. - l won't. And don't be hanging around that corner at the lane there, do you hear me? l won't. We're getting a video. All right. Be good. What are you doing up there? l'm just- just correcting a few copybooks. ls it not freezing up there? lt is, yeah, but l'll be down shortly. See you later. Yeah. Be good now. Shh, Ringo. Shh. Oh. Nicholas's voice: Hi, Lena. lt's Nicholas. The eagle has landed. l'm here in Cobh. lt's a beautiful sunny day- for the next 20 minutes, anyway. And l've booked us a restaurant. l was just wondering, what time do you get in at? l can't wait to see you. Really looking forward to seeing you again. Anyway, l'm surrounded by lamebrains and dilettantes here, but don't worry about that. We'll have a laugh. All right, give me a call. Okay, bye. Nicholas: l'm just saying maybe you should read it again, because you've misread it completely. - Excuse me, Mr. Holden. - Are you my ride? Yeah, sorry. l got stuck at the school. - Thanks for the drink. - You're welcome. Listen, this has thrown my whole day out of whack now. l was supposed to do an interview for "The Observer." - Here, let me get that. - No, l got it, l got it. This interview- now l don't know how l'm going to fit that in. You can't just leave me sitting in the foyer like this. - l'm a sitting duck. - Mind yourself. We'll get you there. We'll get you there on time, don't worry. You see, what happens is, when l'm left hanging around in the hotel, people feel entitled to come up to you and harass you and criticize your book. Like l give a fuck what he thinks. The book's a best-seller. The critics love it. Like l care. l mean, Jesus Christ. lt's like an old lrish boxing coach of mine said... "The fortress has to move, boy. Otherwise you're taking hits. And then your energy is gone." Stay on the move. Nothing to prove. Have you done some boxing? A bit, when l was at college. What weight? Uh, light middleweight. Any good? Not really. More black eyes than medals. Did you ever knock anybody out? Nope. l did. Brutally satisfying, l have to say. l know that's a terrible thing to admit, but it's true. Nicholas: The director had cut the scene, not me. So Richard's looking at me and he sees what l'm looking at. So he looks off towards the director and the director ends up creeping off back towards the toilets or something, trying to hide. So finally the director is gone. So l said "Richard, to be honest with you, l have no idea why that scene has been cut, but l do happen to have it here right with me. Shall we go to your trailer and have a look at it?" And that scene which wasn't in the book- by the way, those of you who haven't read the book, it is for sale right outside the marquee here. l've just come out with a paperback edition. lt's a very good book, by all accounts. So thank you, Richard Harris. Anybody in here? Hello? Hello? Uh, Miss Morelle- l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l didn't mean to startle you. My name is Michael Farr. l'm here to take you into town. Jesus, you scared me. Sorry. Michael: Thanks. Do do you think the house is going to be all right for you? Lena: Oh, yes yes. lt's gonna be fine. l just thought l was going to be staying in town. Michael: Yeah, l know. l don't know why they put you out there. Lena: Oh. Hello. Oh, hi. Hi. How are you? Oh, oh, l don't know. lt must be this new phone. No, see, l won't really be able to 'cause l'm- no, l'm on my way to a reading. No, please don't do that. No no no, we can just- we can meet later. Hello? Hello? Well, if you need anything, just give me a shout, won't you? - What? l'm sorry? - That's my number. - Oh, okay. - lf there's anything you need, - just give me a call. - Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks. - Michael: Good luck. - Lena: Thanks. Lena: Thanks. This is from "The Eclipse." "When you see a ghost, something very interesting happens. Your brain splits in two. One side of you is rejecting what you're seeing because it doesn't tally with our ordinary idea of reality. And the other side is screaming, "But this is real!" And in that moment reality itself is collapsed and reconfigured in a way that changes you profoundly, although at the time you're not aware of it. When Mary felt someone sitting on the bed, a tiny depression, she assumed that her daughter had come back to ask her about the fortune teller. Half asleep, she reached out to reassure her and, not feeling anything, she opened her eyes and looked up. What she saw was so casual, she hardly thought about it for a moment. Seeing the dead woman's face, she thought, "Oh, l must be dreaming." however, when the woman opened her mouth, herjaw hanging slack and her sad eyes imploring to-" "her sad eyes-" um... "her sad eyes imploring to Mary from the gloom, then she knew. She knew that she was seeing a ghost. Then she realized for perhaps the first time in her life that she too would die, that her husband would die and that her children would die. She knew in that moment that she was looking at reality." Uh, l'll tell you what- could you just bring me your best bottle of champagne? - Yes, sir. - You have Cristal? - Of course, sir. - Perfect. Thank you. l'm so sorry. l had to do this interview. And l didn't realize you were in the restaurant. l thought we were meeting at the bar. No no, l didn't want to meet at the bar because we couldn't talk earlier when we were at the bar. Look at you. You look fantastic. Thank you. And you smell nice. So... it is so good to see you again. lt is so good to see you too. What? What? Well, l've just been listening to all of your messages. Oh oh. l'm sorry about that. l started to panic that maybe you weren't coming. - Yeah, l nearly didn't. - What? Well, l thought we were going to behave like nothing ever happened. l wish l could. God, Nicholas. Lena, honestly, l'm haunted by that night. Yeah yeah, it was- You should see the shit l've been writing since that night. l mean, it's- it made me question everything- the whole lot. What am l doing with my life? l'm a fake. - No, you're not a fake. - l'm a miserable fake and the dishonesty has to end. l've even been trying to tell my wife l don't really love her. And you're to blame. l mean, not to blame blame, but- The thing is, if you think about it, we hardly know each other. No, l don't know about past life - or if we've been here before- - Now come on. You brought out a gentleness in me that l thought was dead, gone. l even tried to tell Susan about our- No. But- l know- l didn't. l didn't have the courage. Actually, you told me that night that you and your wife were separated. Well, l've never been more separated than l was that night. Okay. l don't know how this connection happened, but- Listen, Nicholas. l just don't share this... feeling. l'm sorry. Because l'm married? Well, obviously, there's that. Because- because that's- Even if you weren't, - l just don't. - Okay okay, wait. Okay, all right. Too fast, too fast, too fast. l realize l'm a little overwhelming. Okay, l'm gonna calm down now. l'm sorry. Um, listen. We're both just here for a couple of days. Why don't we just live in the here and now? Nicholas, Lena, l won't disturb you. Just to let you know there's a bunch of us going to go up as far as lsabel House for a little traditional session- - a bus outside to take us there, you know, if you wanted to follow us up later on or something. - No, l'll join you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Only if you're finished now. - l'm ready. - Just to give you the option, you know. - Thank you. l'll be right with you. - See you outside. Finished? What are you doing? You know, l can't do this. l'm really sorry. Le- Lena. Lena. Cristal, sir. Hello. Who's calling, please? All right, l will. Hello. Oh, yeah. Hi. Hi. No, not at all. Not gonna be a problem. Where are you? Everything all right? Yeah. No, l'm a bit- l forgot how much drink flows at these things and l didn't have anything to eat and too much wine. Do you want to stop off and get something? No no, l- it's not necessary. l'm just- would you mind if l had a smoke? No, not at all. - Here. - Oh, thanks. Thanks. l don't really smoke. Neither do l. Thank you. l have to open the window. The kids don't like the smell. Oh, you have kids? How old are they? 13 and 10. No, 14 and 11. Oh, that's nice. - Do you have any kids? - Yes. l have a son. He's 18. He's in his first year in college, so l miss him terribly. l'm sure you do. Oh my God. Look at this view. Can we stop the car for a moment? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah. Lena: Wow, look at this. Michael: Be careful there, Miss Morelle. Be careful. Don't- you don't want to get too close to the edge. Lena, careful. Lena: Oh. Oh my God. Oh my God. Are you all right? Oh my God. Are you all right? - Lena: Do you want a hand? - Yeah. - l'm so sorry. l didn't mean to laugh. - Jesus Christ. - Let me help you. Are you okay? - l think so. Nothing broken? Oh my God. l'm so sorry. Lena: Oh God. Lena: Thank you. - Michael: Good night now. - Lena: Good night. - Michael: Need a hand? - Lena: Yes, please. lt's so fucking quiet out here. Where have they put me? Oh, well, thank you very much. l'll have to stay here now. Will you come in for a minute just till l get some lights on? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. Are you hungry? No no, l'm grand. Thanks. l'm starving. Let's see what we have here. You'll have to help me. There's no way l'm dragging all this cheese and jam back to London. Will you have some red wine or a drop of- what is this- whisky? No, l won't, thanks. l have to drive back. Well, you're taking this home because l'm not drinking it. Should be a corkscrew somewhere. - Do you need a hand? - No, l'm good. What? l was just thinking that when you- when you fell into that hole, you just completely disappeared. l'm sorry. lt's really funny. l'm glad somebody's amused. l nearly broke me fucking arse. Thanks. This smells very expensive. What? l said stick with me. Oh, l think l will. Some life you writers have- swanning around festivals and whatnot. What, are you kidding? l never do this. - Why is that? - 'Cause l get too embarrassed and l never think my work is any good and l'm not a natural performer. Well, l thought you were fantastic this afternoon. Now l've been doing this festival for about 10 years now and you're one of the very few writers that l've ever been bothered seeing. You have such an honesty in your writing. lt's the ghosts in your books- they're so real. Yeah, well, could we please not talk about that, because it's really spooky here and l'll never get to sleep? Sorry. Oh, yeah. Um, l was told to ask you- there's a lunch tomorrow for all the writers. lt's a real fixture at the festival. lt's usually a bit of fun. And l could give you a lift there if you want. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Well, no, not really. l never normally drink this much. And it's just been a really weird and a very long day. l'm sorry. Yeah, well, right. l'm sorry. l'll leave you in peace. Try and get some sleep. Mm. Oh, Michael, would you mind getting me a blanket from in there? What, do you not want to get into bed? Hmm-mm. lt's too spooky. l'd rather sleep in here with all the lights on. Oh, thank you. l'll be all right once l get some sleep. What is that? l don't know. Probably some kind of a bird. You think? Yeah, a heron, or maybe a fox. lt's freaky. You really believe in ghosts, don't you? Why? Have you seen one? l don't know. l mean, can you see the ghost of someone who's still alive? Maybe, if that- if that person's close to death, they might come to you and- let's please not talk about this stuff. - Yeah, l'm sorry. - You should get going. Your wife is probably wondering where you are. Yeah. Well, l'll pick you up for the lunch tomorrow, okay? - Good night. - Good night. Oh fuck! All right? - Where were you? - l had a problem with the car. ls Thomas in bed? What? What is it? He went out. Out? What do you mean, he went out? l couldn't stop him. He wanted a can of coke. For fuck's sake, Sarah! Where's your brain? Where did he go? - The petrol station. - What? - The petrol station. - The petrol station. What petrol station? - l don't know. - Oh, for Jesus's sake. Michael: Come on. Thomas: l just- Michael: You've no right to go out and you should have known that, all right? Give me the sweets. Give me the sweets. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Hurry up. Get in the car. - Thomas: l just- Michael: Get in the car. Put your seat belt on. Polish? Or Romanian? lrish. See, now l knew that. Listen, can l get one more? - l know it's late. - Sure. - Am l keeping you up? - Not at all. - You sure? - Sure. l don't want to interrupt. - Would you mind signing for my niece? - No, not at all. Could you make it to Andrea? - Yes, of course. - Thanks. - Sorry. - No, you're grand. l thought your reading yesterday was brilliant. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Have you seen any of the area? No, not really. l haven't had the time. Michael, you should take Lena up to see Selskar Abbey. They say it's haunted. - That's a good idea. - That sounds interesting. Yeah, it is. l'll see you in a minute. All right, Thanks, Jenny. - She enjoyed my reading. - A lot of people did. That's wonderful. So tell me, Michael, what do you write? What do l write? l don't write. l'm a woodwork teacher. Someone was telling me you write. Who? Just someone earlier. No no, l- l used to mess around a little when l was younger like a lot of people, but no, l don't write. Well, what did you write then- stories? Yeah, stories mostly, and some bloody terrible poetry. Oh oh, yeah. Jim Belton was telling me all about you earlier. - Sorry, what? - Jim Belton was telling me about you. Oh, right. Yeah, sure. None of us have any secrets with ol' Jim about the place. Well, l was sorry to hear that you lost your wife. l didn't realize. Yeah, well, it's tough on the kids, you know- very tough. Yeah, and very tough on you too, though. Yeah yeah, well. Do you ever imagine your name on a gravestone? l don't have to imagine. My parents are buried in here. Oh, l'm sorry. No, it was a while back. Well, still, it's not easy to lose a parent. Nope. Oh. What a beautiful place. They say your wishes come true if you're kneel in under the arch round there and say a prayer to St. August. - And have you tried it? - As a boy l probably did. Did it work? Not yet. But that's a busy spot, you know. Lena: Oh, look. Michael: Yeah, Michael Farr. That's my name. Lena: And Angela. He asked her up to dance when they were both 17. They went to the dance with different people. lt was nearly war, l believe. Oh, so love conquers all. l don't know. He was an awful man. Really? Yeah, well... l mean, she was crazy about him, but he was- he was always looking over the next hill, you know. Hmm. What? No, nothing. You were about to say men are always looking over the next hill, weren't you? - No, l wasn't. - You were, weren't you? No, l wasn't. l was going to ask you if this is the place your wife was buried as well, and then l thought it might be too personal. No, she's- she's somewhere else. You never came close to tying the knot yourself? Oh, no, l'm a complete disaster. Not that l haven't had a few offers. Don't get me wrong. No, l'm sure you have. - Oh. - Here. Go on this way. Go on. Get in there. Get in there. Welcome to lreland. Michael: When did you see a ghost? Lena: l must have been about 11 years old. And l was on holiday with my parents in ltaly. We were staying at this hostel. And one night l woke up and there was this little girl sitting on the edge of my bed. And she said something to me in ltalian. She said something about looking for her sister, l think. And- and then she just disappeared. Were you freaked out? Yes, l was terrified. But at the same time l was so intrigued and fascinated that l actually ended up studying theoretical physics at university. - Jesus. - Just for one year. Because that moment had awakened such a curiosity within me. But why? What have you seen? Michael: Well, it's weird, but- Lena: Oh my God, look. Nicholas! Nicholas, what happened? Some idiot gave me shellfish. - Lena: Oh my God. - Man: ls he going to be all right? - He's allergic to shellfish. - We never gave him shellfish. They gave me shellfish! Maybe we should call an ambulance. Michael, call an ambulance. - l have a carjust down here. - We'll take you in the car. - Nicholas: Jesus. - Come, we'll take you. We'll take you in Michael's car. We'll take you to the hospital. - My heart is racing. - Just breathe. Try and take frequent breaths Through the nose. Oh, are you getting sick? Michael: Well? Well, they gave him some antihistamine and brought his heart rate back down, but they say it might have been a panic attack. - Oh, right. - Yeah. Well, he'll be all right. They'll let him go. Oh, good. l'm- l might stay and wait with him. He's a bit shook up. Well, do you want me to stay with you? No, that wouldn't be fair. We'll take a taxi. - You sure? - Yeah. You should get back to your kids. Yeah, okay. Well, if you need anything, just give me a call. l will. Okay, l'll- Thanks for everything. Thanks for a lovely day. lt's all right, l- Bye. Sister. No! No, Malachy! No! No! No! - No! - Dad, wake up. Dad, what happened? No, it's just- it's just a dream. lt's just a dream. Shh, it's okay. Shh. lt's okay, Sarah. Shh, it's okay. lt's okay. lt's just a dream. There there. lt's just a dream. Shh. lt's okay. lt's just a dream. Shh. Do you want a cup of tea? Yeah, thanks. l just want to make a call. Look, l'll grab that cup of tea, uh... when l get back. l just- Jesus. Jesus Christ! Oh, Michael. l didn't know who else to talk to. What happened? What's wrong? Uh... - What the hell is going on? - lt's all right, Nicholas. Nicholas: Do you have any idea what time it is? - What's he doing here? - l'm sorry. - Nicholas: lt's half 5:00 in the morning. - Shh, Nicholas, it's okay. Nicholas: lt's not okay. lt's 5:30 in the morning. l didn't know you were here. Well, it's a good thing l bloody well was. You stop harassing this woman. Lena: That's enough! Just stop it! Nicholas: l'll call the police. He's a bloody stalker. Lena: This is the man who helped you last night, so just stop it. Michael, Michael. Michael, what's the matter? What's wrong? What happened? l have to go. l- l shouldn't have come here. Lena, can l just tell you that you're insane to encourage that type? You should leave, Nicholas. - What? - What's it to you who calls here anyway? Lena, that guy is a stalker. - No, he's not a stalker. - l see the way he looks at you. He's a stalker. They're failed writers, all of them. They get us to come to their festival and then they start hitting us with their books and their ideas and their obsessions. l'm telling you, the guys who drive you around- they're the worst. l wouldn't even be here in the first place if you hadn't lied to me. What's the matter with you? Are you fucking nuts? Wait wait wait, l didn't lie to you. Just leave, Nicholas. l want you to leave. l shouldn't have let you stay here in the first place. How can l just leave? We're in the middle of nowhere. l don't care. Call a taxi. Lena. Lena, come on. Excuse me. Oh, there's a woman after my own heart. Thank you. Hi. l remember you. Last year, right? Ah, Nicholas, come and meet Carlo. - Carlo: Nicholas, so nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Carlo: Would you oblige me by signing my program? Why, certainly, yes. Have you seen Lena Morelle? No, l haven't seen her at all. - No? - Cheers, Nicholas. Thank you. Woman: Can you sign this, Nicholas? Oh, certainly. - Can you sign mine too? - Pleasure. Yes, of course. Thanks. Oh. Sorry. There you are. - Thanks. - l'll be back to you. - Are you taking off? - Just a few more days. l'll be back to you. l just- - Lena. - Nicholas. - Your wife is here. - My what? Your wife is here. We just booked her into the hotel. She left her bag in the room. What? My wife is here? - Jim: We decided... - Michael: You decided? - ...as a gesture... - Michael: As a gesture? - ...to fly her in here. - Michael: You flew her in here? And there she is. Susan. He just told me. l can't believe- what? What are you doing? Thanks, Jim. Michael: Sorry. Would you excuse me? Hello. Lena, hi. No. Jesus. Yeah, listen, l'm sorry about what happened this morning. Mm-hmm. And you're sure you didn't do this to yourself? l mean, if you were dreaming, you could have been banging around the wardrobe sleepwalking. Yeah, that's possible, l suppose, but it's not like a dream. You- you- you can't explain it. What time did Malachy die at? We don't know yet. But l've been seeing him over the past few days. l don't know. l've been writing a lot of it down. Would you let me read that? Oh, l- l don't know. Have you- have you ever seen Eleanor- l mean, since she passed away? No. And l wish l did because you're terrified of forgetting that person. l mean, you hang on to the pain even because you're afraid that if you let it go... That you'll lose them. Yeah, l know. Nicholas: Stop. Would you stop the car? Lena: Oh, for fuck's sake. Lena. Lena. Nicholas, l'm going to bed. No, listen, l told her. We're free. lt's over. Lena: Please, Nicholas, l'm going to bed. Nicholas: Lena, you have to help me through this. Lena: Please go home. You're drunk. Nicholas: What am l gonna do? The taxi's gone. l don't care. l'm gonna call you another taxi. - Where am l gonna go? - Please just go home. Leave. ♪ lf it weren't for the alligators ♪ ♪ l'd sleep here ♪ ♪ ln the woods ♪ ♪ But l don't- ♪ Nicholas, please stop. ♪ You're welcome here ♪ ♪ Kind stranger. ♪ That's what you're supposed to say. Oh. Oh, l see. This genius. Every time l turn around, this stalker's haunting me. Nicholas. Why don't you do us both a favor and take a hike before you get hurt? Nicholas, you're drunk. l'm not drunk! l'm not drunk! Okay, you want to be a tough guy? Why don't we just- want to fight for her? - Don't be daft. - Come on, come on. Come on, let's fight for her. Come on, come on. Jesus Christ. Stop, Nicholas. lt's all right. He says he's boxed. Michael, please don't fight him. Please don't. Please stop. That's right. That's it. Put your guard up. Put your guard up. Stop it, Nicholas, please. Oh my God. - Okay, it's all right. - Are you crazy? - l'll pay for all that. - Are you crazy? Okay, all right, l think he's had enough. - You had enough? - Lena: Just leave him- Stop it! Stop it! l said stop it! Stop it. Let him go. Nicholas, stop. Sorry. l'm sorry. Shit. Fuck. That was a total fucking accident. - Just your boyfriend- - Stay away from me! Stay away from me! Ow! - Okay okay. - Michael: Let go! - l'm letting go. - Michael: Let go. l let go. l let go! Michael: Jesus Christ. Come on. Okay okay. Okay, you win. You win. You win. - Are you all right? - Yeah yeah. Ow. Michael: Are you going to be all right? Lena: Yeah. l'm going to have a fucking black eye. Michael: Actually, l'm going to be stiff for a month. Lena: God. You know, l'm really sorry about all this, Michael. You have nothing to be sorry for. Oh, l don't know about that. There's your taxi. Yeah. l really- l need to go home, Michael. These past few days have just been so crazy. l've been- l know. - Michael: Have fun. - See you, Dad. Dad. Michael's voice: Hi, you can leave a message for Michael, Thomas or Sarah. Thanks. Oh, hi, Michael. lt's Lena here. l just wanted to say thanks for looking after me so well. And we never really got a chance to say goodbye properly after that mad mad night. Um, and l wanted to say thanks for your stories. l was very flattered to get them. They're great! And l hope you don't mind, but l showed them to my friend Maurice Fuhrman at a dinner party l had here the other night. And he publishes mystery, horror, supernatural stuff. And he really liked them. They really are beautifully written, Michael. Anyway, so l thought if you ever wanted me to... put you in contact or- well, l don't want to use up all your time. l just need your address. And if you're coming to London for any reason, please do let me know because l'd love to- l'd love to meet up again and, uh, yeah. Anyway, l'm rambling on. l hope things are going well for you and you're not being too harassed by- by life. Anyways, call me. Ringo. Sit.
