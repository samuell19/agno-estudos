- Where are you from? - From afar. - Are you Spanish? - No, from farther away. - Portuguese? - No. - Italian? - No, no. - Sicilian? - No. - Are you English? - Excuse me? - Scottish? - From farther away. - Irish? - From farther away. - Polynesia? - No, from farther away. - So, are you Hungarian? - No. - Are you Czech? - No, from farther away. - Yugoslavian? - Farther away. - Romanian, perhaps? - No, from farther away. - Ah! You are Egyptian. - No, I am not Egyptian. - Are you from Mozambique? - No, from farther, farther away. - Are you from Cape Verde? - No... Green Cape? Never heard of it. - South African? - No, from farther away. - From Angola? - From farther away. - From Congo. - No, from farther away. May I see your documents, your passport? No, I only have my residency documents. - Algerian... - Yes. - Are you from Senegal? - No, from even farther away. I give up, I don't know where you're from. From afar... from far away. It looks like we got off on the wrong subway station buddy. In French, please. It's necessary to practice. Then we should speak in French. Did you go to the Alliance Française School? No, I think we have to go there in the morning Look, here comes Varela. How much do the... the French lessons cost? 505 francs? Yes, 505 francs. Is he Chilean? Yes, he is a leftist independent. Hello. Did you watch yesterday's debate? No. We have to watch them. French politics are what's important now. A survey showed that there is a small percentage... of the voters that don't know who to vote for. They don't have a political opinion... therefore the French Popular Union depends on them... and because of that small group a second term is at risk. We are speaking French! Okay, I have to go now. See you. Call me. Do you have my number? Yes, I'll call you. - He speaks French very well. - Too well... We need to maintain our national identity. It is wrong to be a French leftist... - above being Chilean. - Yes. I met your father in Morocco... He was the Chilean ambassador in Egypt, I think. No, he was the cultural attaché. I don't know which is more important. At that time I was in RREE, but after my divorce I moved back. But let me ask you a question: Why did you choose France as your exile country? France isn't the country that your father loved. We have lost our cultural importance. It is terrifying! Culture is the poor relation. In addition, we have lost our overseas territories. For me, the only worthy French is Senghor. Sedar Senghor the great poet... the poet of negritude. I just read... I think that the last representative of the French culture should be in a Manaos library, or in Haiti. Anyway, something happened to me here in France... I spend half of the year in Brazil. It's the country of the "Joie de vivre", not for everyone of course. Besides, there is potential for development. For me, the future is in the third world. That's why the events in Chile shocked us so much. To every social level, industrial sector, me, as well as to the average French worker... what happened to Allende was horrible. I have many friends there. Intellectuals, businessmen... you name them. It was the only country in Latin America where the president had a great French culture! Alessandri... Yes. I met the president in 1959. I had the feeling then that something was going to happen. Things were very quiet all around, but... Well, we shouldn't separate like this. Leave your information with my secretary. - What's your name? - Luis. Luis? So long Luis. - Good evening. - Hello. Let's go son. Thanks a lot. - Well, I'll take off, okay? - Bye. - Hello. - How's it going? Listen, more people arrived. Perfect. I am handing you the key. Please give it to Dubois. You can only use it for two days. Bye. Perfect, bye. - Can you give me a shawl? - Yes. - Are you tired? - Yes. Yes. Here, have a blanket. It's a little bit tight in here. Did you get comfortable there? But offer him something to eat! Well, let's go to sleep. We need to go to the prefecture tomorrow morning. Fernando Vial Errazuriz... Vial, from my father's side and Errazuriz from my mother's side. We use two surnames in Chile. You are Brazilian, right? You don't know much about this... From my mother's side I am a descendant of Valdes Balmaceda... I am the president's great nephew. And from the Errazuriz side... well... Errazuriz... are the ones that built Chile. Let me tell you, Chile is very different from Brazil. We built Chile and we made it enormous. I am talking about Errazuriz that were, for example, twenty years in power. For a thriving Chile... The Chile of copper, saltpeter, of the large fortunes... well, we could manage power. Because certain training and category are required. A moral category, almost. Of course... Chile was ready to manage itself, to become a perfect democracy, but these little people have come in the way, these low level police officers, these Mendozas, Pinochets. And, of course, they screwed everything up, but we will be the ones that will boost Chile forward. These people are doomed to fail. They don't know how to exert power. They don't know what power is. When Fabian Luna visited the Olympia, there were three sides: The tough ones, who wanted to beat him immediately. The second one that consisted of a "Chilean kidnapping". That has nothing to do with an armed assault, but an invitation to dinner, drink and talk with him so that he is late, and therefore cannot sing. The third one consists of taking advantage of the kidnapping to explain the situation to him and finally turn him onto more correct positions. Well, I am leaving... I have plenty to do in the Hotel. Wait, wait, have a drink with us first. No, no, no. Seriously, please, I need to go! Let's wait for the guys, and we will go with you. Believe me, I need to call my agent in Chile. I need to explain to him how things are going along. But what is your problem? Stay a little longer... and then you can talk on the phone. Listen, you have to understand that I have a schedule that I have to comply with. But we have a plan for you. I have a reception and can't stay. We also have a small reception for you okay? After that we will take you wherever you have to go. No, I need to call Chile now... Have a drink now, let's wait until the guys arrive and we can all talk about this. Got a light? Do you agree? Fine, but let's go back early because I need to make that call! Sure, we'll talk about that later. I deal with those who speak French, and you can handle the ones who speak Spanish. For example, here's an address: Odeon 1428, Mr. Aristia. You have to call him on behalf of Madame Male. You have to tell him we have news that his son is well. And since this lady has a large house... well, find out whether there are accommodation possibilities. I have another one here... Bagatel 4514 to Mr. Tomás Goicolea... this is a Spaniard who lived in Chile for a long time. He is here and owns a shoe store So we need to know whether we can get some shoes from him or not. Then, let's see... Here... Opera 3122, Ingrid Mayerhold... You have tell her that “you know who" is okay, but that he needs a ticket. So, what is the address of that guy that owns the shoe store? - Bagatel 4514. - Okay. This meat is rather tasteless. It stinks. It's because it has been too long in the fridge. The issue with meat is that since few people in Latin America have access to meat, they only eat fillet and loin, but not the entire animal. Whereas, here it's the other way around... and by chance... we seem to have found a bad piece of meat. Hey, how much meat do Cubans receive? I think... about 200 grams per week. 200 grams per week? I thought it was only 100. Yes, but they increased it. But that is almost four million pounds per week! What is she saying? She says there is a problem... She says we are too noisy. The little kids, man! They don't play in the yard, but always in the hallway. She says that the assembly... the assembly thinks Chileans care too much about themselves and not... She is right. They think they can talk about Chile because they were in Bolivia for a couple of days! Come on, they are right. I cannot take it any longer! Hello comrades! News from Chile. The Cardinal Archbishop of Chile, Raul Silva Enriquez, criticized the military authorities when he said: "We have told them on several occasions that the fundamental" "rights of human beings cannot be violated." "We have repeatedly told them this and they have simply ignored us." Okay, this shit is over! The military is screwed. - Do you want to smoke? - Sure. I have the impression that I have met you before. Me too. What is your name? - Rogelia, and you? - Beatriz. Maybe we haven't met... And how long ago did you get here? Three months. About the same as me. I suppose that the guys are playing pinball now. Probably. That's good for them, they are having fun. Having fun is necessary. Going to the movies... watch TV... play... Look, it seems there is someone peeking through the window... Move him to the right hand side. Help me out here. 'Le Monde'? Has 'Le Monde' arrived yet comrades? Here it is. Hello... Hello. Hello. How is the patient doing? He is doing as fine as someone who has been on hunger strike for fifteen days. His acetone levels are high and he has low blood pressure. His health will worsen if he doesn't eat. He is in danger, isn't he? He is currently stable, but his health can worsen at any minute. Then we would need to inevitably hospitalize him. Do you want a glass of wine? No, no. But your friend, why is he on a hunger strike? Is it a protest for what's happening in Chile? No. It's because he has a friend who's on asylum at an embassy, and he wants his friend to be sent back to Chile. And does he really think that by doing this he will help his friend? We don't agree with it. It seems you are very cramped in here. Can I do anything about the accommodations? How many people can you lodge? Me? I don't know... one person. One person? Varela. Hello. Can you really accommodate me? Sure, no problem. Why? Do you have your car with you now? Yes, why? Nothing really. I have my baggage here. Are you coming with me now? Yes, right away. Let me look for my two other bags and I will be back. Great. Hey, keep rehearsing. I will take a quick nap. Do you mind us playing? No, go ahead. Comrade! Comrade! Come here! Portugal fell! Fascism fell in Portugal! The younger soldiers took power. I hope this happens in Chile! The younger soldiers taking power! Pinochet has little time left, man. Long live Chile, man! Forever! Good morning. How are things going in Chile? In Chile things are going really well. The situation has changed a lot. People are happy and calm now, and they don't fight as they did before. Because there was a time when people argued all the time, especially about politics... Not any more. People now live in peace, they look happy. Like the other day... because you are aware that there are still demonstrations... Of course, people have to demonstrate about something, I mean, there is always something to demonstrate about. I saw this demonstration when I was walking down the street. I saw a group of people. It didn't look like a demonstration, because there wasn't any yelling. Or writings on the walls... It was original, amusing! People walked saying things, but very softly. Like whispering, very quietly... Like in mass, in the church... Yes, it was very amusing... The other day, also... I saw another demonstration, where a group of people were walking down the street as usual, shopping, driving their cars, doing their thing... but you could tell that they were all together, and they all had to do with each other, because they looked at each other... they looked as if they were saying things to each other... Hey, speaking about shopping... how is the economic situation? Can you earn good money? Yes, you can earn money. You can earn lots of money. It's doing well, really well. I am not much up to date about the value of the Chilean currency now... How much did you make on your last show? During the last one? Yes, during the last one. Well, that was a tour we had. We went to Peru, Guayaquil, and... I didn't get a bonus then. But how much did you make roughly? I earned two hundred dollars. And that is a percentage of what? ...of the total earnings? We signed an agreement for ten thousand dollars. But ten thousand dollars, that is not much... Well, for me that's a lot... I make my flyers, I perform and that is good enough for me. But the profit margin of that amount is too high for the producer. Yes, the producer makes good money, but he has to pay for advertising, - Five hundred - Cover travelling expenses, he covers expenses, allowances, - Three hundred dollars - One thousand dollars top, and he is paying you two hundred. Yeah, he doesn't pay me much and he makes money, but... I have a career. All I want to do is perform. I'm an artist and I get to do that to make myself known. Stay here, don't move. We are going to throw you that reception party we were talking about. I will be right back. A welcome party, fantastic! How is it going? One certainly is screwed... Why? Because I am the one who's doing the work... I am the one that is performing... I am the one everyone knows... and it's the producers who earn the lion's share. Don't tell me he is not a scumbag if he's making 20, 30 times as much as I make. Sure, anyone could go talk to the people directly, and tell them, "I am Fabian Luna", who is well known... everyone in Chile knows who I am. Yet nobody knows who the producer is, nobody knows him. We should take care of our own business and make some money... a little bit more... a lot more, to be fair. We could go around with our own ideas, because everyone has their own ideas about other things that can be done. For example, I came here to France to sing about the truth in Chile But I car sing about other truths I car say other things could call the Junta. propose an idea to them, get some money and a big piece of the revenues... For example, I could start my own record label with some people who would work with me. With the help of some money, and I have some, I could do it myself. I could stop depending on the produced! I could offer work... to you, for example. If you are interested, we could work together. - Do you have some money? - No... You don't have any money! You can work with me. You can come and work with me You have a truth to say, haven't you? We could sing, for example, about the truths of the exiled, ah? How's that? What do you think? Perfect. Let's work together then. Done. What disturbs me is that these scumbags keep making - all the money and that can't go on. - Scumbags! Exploited... that's what we all are... these scumbags... This can't go on like this. We need to end this once and for all. That is what I think... We can't allow these bastards to keep on making money like this... Now that there is order, we can put an end to this... We can end this, can't we? Because that's what order is for. Before we had nothing. We had nothing because there was chaos... There was a lot of chaos, but now we can, do things. Now there are things because there is order. The military has put order in place. They have brought us authority, because before there was no hierarchy. Nobody followed any rules. But now it's different, things can be done. A lot of things can be done. They, the military, have brought power. They have brought authority, and they can force people to work better. I believe that the army is now mighty. Before... if an invasion from Peru or Argentina had happened, what would we have done? Nothing, nothing. Now it's different. Now we can go to Peru and... How do you feel? I feel very good. I am really happy about being amongst friends. I want to take this opportunity to send everyone a big hug from Europe. And that I am very happy... really. Man, there's a letter for you! What happened? A letter. Okay, wait a minute... you know these guys are behind with their work. Okay kids, move! Let's see... Ah! A letter From Chile. There's also a letter for Guaton Cotapos! The same old story, pal. Almost all letters say the same thing. I almost never read them. Each tells the same story. My friend, would you excuse me, please, please, my friend... Let me introduce myself, Ramon Larrain. Brother of Juanito. Juanito Larrain, do you know him? The painter. The painter of people's simple things. Shit, you should know him! The same one that created "Spitting Prohibited”, "Smoking Prohibited", "Move to the hallway", and "Use the back door" and all those signs that they use back there... I was... I mean, I am an army officer... retired of course. I was expelled because of a little problem I had with Blanquita Amaro. Blanquita Amaro, pal, the one who... I was her lover, representing Chile, nothing less. There, Atten-hut! Should I tell you what she did? You know what pal? I should leave, because here in Paris you need to work to earn a living. Okay guys, let's move! I'll be back, excuse me. Reading 'Le Monde' is a typical activity of Chilean people. That's because we've never been able to rid ourselves of the influence of 'El Mercurio'. Yes, 'Le Monde' and 'El Mercurio' are similar newspapers. They are both objective publications. But 'Le Monde' is against the Junta. 'Le Monde' is far more objective than 'EI Mercurio'. We should ask the French their opinion about 'Le Monde'. Every French reads 'Le Monde'. All Chileans read 'El Mercurio'. We are alike to that sense, because if the Chileans read 'El Mercurio' and the French read 'Le Monde'... About my artistic career, I can say that it had no beginning, because music flows through my veins. Of course there was an episode that greatly influenced me to start my career. It was while we were in high school in Viña del Mar, and the "USS Oriskany", the largest aircraft carrier in the world, came to Valparaiso. Everyone called it the "Guarisnaque" back then. So we all went to see the arrival of this huge ship, which had a special suspension system that allowed it to enter directly into the dock, where people were waiting for it, like a party, a great party! Then the aircraft carrier gates opened, and instead of two hundred airplanes, two hundred pianos appeared... which, under the brilliant direction of Mr. Jose Iturbi, played Franz Listz's Hungarian Rhapsody. Hey, pal, excuse me. But, with all due respect, I have a problem with my brother who lives back there... This sucker keeps on writing graffiti on the walls. His wife... shit, she has asked him to stop many times... "Juanito, stop with the graffiti..." And since he likes art, he continues. The artistic vein is inside him. He loves painting. I have a letter here for Chile. Because, you know what, I've been told that Juan is kind of sentenced to death... I don't know if he has already been sentenced to death, or if he is kind of sentenced, I'm not sure, but this is a doubt I will settle once he writes me back. So I have a letter here to send to Chile. Almost everyone has helped me to proofread the letter, so I will read it to you so you can help me too... because my grammar is not very good. While I was in the military academy, my grammar was poor, very poor. I will read it to you with all due respect. Cheers! It says: "Mr. Alexander Soyenizer" How do you spell Soyenize? Soyinze? It doesn't matter, it's written in Chilean and that's what counts. "Dear Sir. I am writing this letter to you because" "I am currently in a difficult situation, because my brother," "the 'famous painter' Larrain"... it is very important to put 'famous painter' in quotation marks, "Has been convicted and sentenced to death." "Since he has left-wing inclinations, and the Chilean government has right-wing" "inclinations, we can fairly say that he is in your same situation," But backwards. You can see the difference... you know, when you are on one side and then when... you know, that's why you are in Paris, man! "...and since this situation is unfair," from here I see it as totally unfair, I work here in a restaurant, and I have to be tough on these guys... There are Colombians, Bolivians and Peruvians, and they don't work very fast, so you have to be on top of them. "Since this situation is unfair," "because everyone has the right to stand up for the ideas that they think are right," "I am here to request that you write a letter to the Chilean Government," "since they hold you in high esteem." They respect him, you know, with the respect we usually show back there. So, in the end we just say “Thanks". "Thanks", signed: "Ramon Larrain... Retired Lieutenant of the Chilean Army" ...and it is very important that we write 'apolitical' in parenthesis. Many comrades - taking advantage of the solidarity that this situation created - were asking for things that were not associated with the resistance but to solve personal issues, which creates confusion. It's in our power to make ourselves heard. Well, tell her that knowing her interest in our country and the events... She says she is very concerned about the situation in Chile, and that she wishes to help us in any possible way she can... Much like the old times when they helped the Greek and Spanish comrades, you know, comrades of different nationalities. Anyhow, tell her that I am grateful, in the name of our people. She thanks you because you are grateful to her. Now, to be clear, explain to her that we have approached all the relevant organizations, but that... it has not worked out... Now, go ahead, tell her... Well, she offers one round-trip airplane ticket to Chile, or several second-class ship tickets. She will give us an answer as soon as possible throughout our contact. No, no, not doctors... machine guns. You can't use a machine gun in bed! You need a permit. No, you have to learn French. I will call the doctor, and he will give you an aspirin. Just red wine. Red wine. You will have red only if you take your aspirin! Before that you need to learn French. "You take aspirin", "You are in bed", How terrible... "Sheets", “Pillow", "You are in an apartment"... The light? Yes, the light. Good teacher. I'm not a good teacher. You really need to learn. Can I come visit you tomorrow? Yes, thank you. Should I bring you anything? Newspapers. Newspapers? Yes. Books? Yes, books in French. Go ahead, go ahead. Hello. Hello. You have turned into a real Frenchie, pal! How about Paris? This is not easy, you know... It's difficult, but when one manages to do some things... you get it, that's for sure. How did you get here? Oh, that shit... it's rather complicated, let me tell you... Back in Chile I was playing with this rock band here and there... I worked a bit with Gordo Scheffer... so this guy left for the States and sent me a letter, pal... telling me that the real deal was in the States... and that he was acquainted with Andy Iglesias, the true inspirer of Rock & Roll, pal! Do you guys feel like having a drink? And that there was a possibility for me to join him there... So I left for the States. I arrived in the States and I couldn't find the damn fat guy anywhere, and I didn't have a dime... Then I met these sailors from the 'Sudamericana de Vapores'... they were smuggling the good shit... They got it for seven, and I would then sell it for ten... and then I met this Puerto Rican who taught me harmony, counterpoint, all that shit... this guy had no money so I gave him some of the good shit... I got this for five, gave it to him for seven, and I pocketed two... that guitar is really good. I bought it in Spain, pal. Damn, a string broke! Doesn't matter. I am a professional musician. I can play this with two, three or seven chords the same way. So I began studying music seriously, I was eager to develop my musical technique so that I could perform for my audience. I have plenty of fans, you know. I began studying and practicing and this guy got me a job as an interpreter... to go on a turné... a tour to Tegucigalpa, Guatemala, everywhere. I arrived there, and who did I find? That fat guy Scheffer. He was not with the Greeks any more, he was with 'Holiday on Ice', working on some arrangements for them... He is doing fine... In the end he introduced me to some American sailors... among these an officer who needed a saxophonist for his band... I had never played a saxophone before... So I got the gig, and because I have a 'good ear' I didn't have any problems... They made me sign a one-month contract. I thought they would stay put, but their fleet was taking off, so... I had to leave with them. To Japan, Vietnam, China... So these guys were racist pigs... Since I was Latino these guys thought I was Indian! But take a look at me... In Chile we are not Indians, like in Peru or Bolivia, we are white! So the bastards started to show me some respect... I met a Chinese sailor... Those bastards are very dangerous... you can't trust them. They teach them to be treacherous from a young age... You have to be very careful... So, with the Chinese I learnt I could go to the port and serve as an interpreter between the sailors and the Chinese prostitutes... In the meantime, drugs came back and forth... So in the end, the fleet takes off to Mexico, pal. And in Mexico do you know who I saw again? Has anyone seen my book on Chilean-Soviet relations? What an intellectual! So who did I find there? The Scheffer fat guy again... - Let me have a drink - and he wasn't with Holiday on Ice anymore... he was with this other band... So this guy introduces me to guess who... Lucho Gatica. Lucho was on his way down... some people say he was copying scores from other composers... So, Lucho Gatica tried to compose songs like the ones by Bert Kaempfert... but it was the era of stereo, and Lucho Gatica was over... In the end I went back to Chile... You have no idea what a mess Chile was! People were practically penniless in restaurants, nobody respected nobody... I was working with this little orchestra and I was less than a waiter! Me, an educated musician! Because this Puerto Rican really knew about music... I hardly earned a penny... so you know what we did to survive? Meat... meat was scarce at the time... I had a deal with the zoo's park ranger. Do you know what he did? He took the meat from the lions and gave it to us... we bought the meat and sold it for a much higher price. We would go to the slums to sell the meat... we went to the classy neighborhoods and people would pay gold for the meat... and the meat was of great quality! Are you ready? Sure. Let's go. We bought some drugs and took them Peru. We had already earned five times our money with the meat and with the drugs we sold in Peru... We are ready... Around the time that Fabian Luna was living in exile, he insisted on singing for the kids, the sick, the jobless... so he was liked by everyone. Well, the first thing we need to check are the print proofs. Because, I've had experiences... some bad experiences with sociologist, especially with French sociologists. I don't know if you are familiar with some books like... "The Static Revolution" or "The Popular Unity, a New Road"... In those books, and in some others, I have made some statements... Statements that have been misunderstood. This isn't right. And, by the way, this is something that I do for free. Plus, I have too many personal problems to be maintaining sociologists... And, yesterday, during the meeting you asked me a question to get me to speak badly about communists... That's not fair... I don't need a question like that to speak badly about them... On the other hand, I think that you could ask me all the questions you want, but you will never understand Chile... Chile can't be understood by anyone... You will never understand it, so just cut that out... The people that were willing to help found themselves in a predicament; they could not find centralized organizations to channel their help. But since they wanted to be efficient and quick with their help, they began sending funds to groups that were just starting to form... which made them very difficult to centralize later. Hello comrade. Hello. How are you still taking French lessons? That old lady is making a living out of you! Why don't you charge her for the political education you are giving her? What's going on man? Can you come here for a minute please? Please... You screwed it up again, as usual, you asshole Why? What did I do? Please understand, for once, what you are doing. You are old enough not to be screwing up all the time. Can you come here for a minute? But nobody understands a word from that old lady... How come you don't understand what she is saying... She is a French teacher, for Christ's sake! She understands Spanish! Sure, Spanish, but not what we speak. She understands, anyhow. Please stop screwing it up! I have to tell you something personal. He is right, you screwed up for several reasons... she just avoided telling you... its education, you know... Education! Have you been reading "The mise-en-scène of daily life"? And the French version! The black sheep that goes straight... You have to read the original English version! But what do you have against that French translation! I know the translator and he is good... Translator my ass! These assholes are speaking in difficult... I will take a minute of your time for a reason. If you noticed, the comrade left because he didn't understand a word of what you were saying. It seems you have no respect for your fellow comrades that don't have an IQ like the one you think you have. Because you think, and you screw it up! This has to stop. We need to get along. I believe the problem is that you are jealous of the comrade, who is working and has a job, and you haven't managed to get a job yet. That's why you attack him! Same old thing, you always play with words. I hope that in the future you won't behave like you did today. Excuse me for my interruption. Personal criticism, personal criticism. Could I have a minute with you, please? What now? Who is a CIA agent? Who is a CIA agent, dammit? What CIA, you are crazy! What are you saying, bastard! Are you drunk? No, I'm not drunk, stupid. You are saying that I'm a CIA agent. Are you crazy? I haven't said a thing! Next time I will kick your ass. I don't understand a thing... I don't understands a thing! Watch out. Ah! Watch out! I will kick your ass. You have been warned. What happened? This bastard who does not understand a thing! He is crazy! Excuse me, let's go for a drink. So how are you doing? I am not doing well, frankly. I've been a little sick lately. A little tired. I even have an upset stomach My body is aching because we drank too much last night. But my friends have been nice to me, they brought me to see a doctor and I feel better. I feel that I am amongst friends. In exile, refugees still behave as if the were in Chile. When faced with the slightest problem, they resort to the same mechanisms; those of direct democracy, or of the assembly spirit that only make sense within the Chilean environment. All of this with its evident strengths and weaknesses. Well, Paris is very beautiful. The city is really wonderful, the French are nice people, and... well, here we are. Any problems? Problems? Yes. Political problems, for instance. Oh, that's rather complex. I'd rather answer you at some other time. "You use hot water and detergent You wash the salad bowl". Hello Madame! Hello! "He steps in, says hello and leaves." - Hello. - Hello! You guys are not serious. I waited two hours for you. That created a problem for me. Wait, I was thinking about that, and I didn't show up because... if I did, it would have been favoritism. And it was the cult of personality that doomed the Unidad Popular. Hello, Hello, how are you? "You wash another dish and another glass." These guys are not serious. I waited for them... I waited the entire afternoon. Hello! How are you? Hello buddy! How is it going? So so... - And your brother, how is he? - He is fine, thanks. - When did you arrive? - Well, about a month ago. - You've not been here long, then. - No. Yeah. I've been here for a while now. Sorry I have to leave, I am in a hurry. Okay, bye. Hello. Hello. What are you doing here? I was thinking... Would you like to hang out for a while? Let's hang out for a while. Wait a minute! I can't go with you. Settle down, man! Go away, moor! Watch out... Play a bolero, maestro! No, in C, play it in the key of C. We met once in Viña del Mar. Do you remember? You were wearing a blue dress and a hat with a ribbon of the same color. My blue dress... of course! You looked very beautiful, and you told me that we could meet later in the casino. I waited there for you and you never showed up. I waited there for a long time. Later we came across each other again... you didn't see me, but I saw you in a café on Bandera Street, by the Mapocho Station. You went by, and that was huge for me, really huge... Really huge? Yes, and now we came to Paris from different paths and we meet again. Here we are we are different, but we can learn many things. No, no, no sir! No! Mr. Mar, Mr. Mar, take it easy, like we say here. What's the matter? It seems that you are a little loaded. Take it easy now. He has been kidnapped, anyway. "The Chilean dance Cueca!" "In Chile there is only one Cueca," "the Cueca that Chileans hold in their hearts." "Because of all the Chilean dances, Cueca is only one." "Some people say there are different kinds of Cuecas," "the 'bosses' Cueca and the 'rotos' Cueca." "What really happens is that when peasants have some money," "they go buy themselves a good suit and dress elegantly to dance the Cueca." "Because the Cueca is elegant. All of Chile is elegant!" This is crazy man! What's the matter with you comrade? What was the problem with that Arab with the knife? Hey, it's that Arab guy, who bothers me every time he sees me. But don't be like that. You are misinterpreting the whole thing. And how is that? I guess you might be a little... color-biased, and that is wrong. Look, comrade, you know well enough, like I do, that we Chileans are not racists. We have never been and should never be. We agree on that, then. But why then don't you socialize? In the end, if you need to make a small sacrifice, you simply do it... But why? Remember we are all here to defend you. Do you have a problem? What problem? No, I don't like him, that's all! But I think you are afraid of suffering a physical or physiological problem... Look comrade, don't trouble yourself. We have many doctors here in Europe, in France, in Germany, all over the continent. So if it's a matter of penicillin or some other medicine, we are here to support and help you. May I say a few words now? Tell me all you want. First, I don't like him, so what you were saying had nothing to do with the issue. Then, if it is a political issue, we should discuss it, right? It's not political. If you want to discuss it, I can arrange a meeting with all the other comrades, and we can discuss it there. Perfect, I completely agree. That is what democracy is all about, comrade! We are going to have an assembly with all the comrades, and we will find out what your problem is. I think that's fine, I agree. Yes, I agree, but I have decided to do much more than that. I have talked with my Belgian and German friends. We are going to establish a huge organization, not only for you and your friends, but for all of those who weren't lucky enough leave Chile. I thought we could help the comrades that are here first. Fine, but in the end the comrades that are here are privileged. They are physicians, lawyers... if they were specialized workers they would find a job immediately. We have to see things just as they are. We still live under a capitalist regime in Europe. Hello, I wanted to ask if I could find a job here. Now I'm going to talk to the Argentinean guy. But don't worry, because he's the one that found something for Arteaga. If he could speed things up... Don't worry, I will talk to him. By the way, before I forget, the French comrades gave me this envelope with ten thousand dollars, and asked that you hand it over to the MIR comrades. Tell me, you know I have been lodging some comrades... I had to pay two hundred francs in hotel expenses for this guy who arrived the other day... you also know that I gave this guy, you know who... another one hundred francs... Anyway, it all adds to about two hundred. Do you think I could use a little money from here? I was told to give you this ten thousand so that you would hand it to the other comrades. Okay, but I only want to take my two hundred dollars from here... - But that has nothing to do with me! - Okay, it is my responsibility! I am only saying that I will take two hundred dollars from here... because I have had to cover expenses out of my own money... I will sign a receipt, leave it in here and everything will be okay. But the responsibility is yours only! Sure, it's my responsibility to acknowledge I took the money... Hello, take a seat, comrade. If you can't write French well, who is going to take you seriously? Because you started by first asking for a position in one area, then you asked for another job somewhere else and then you ended up asking for solidarity from Chile. Syntax is all wrong, this doesn't make sense! It has spelling mistakes, and I wouldn't care if it were only spelling mistakes... You need to start writing in French correctly so they can take you seriously. I will have to start the story from the very beginning now that the comrade is here. When I got here I had a rough time. I had a rough time because I didn't have a work permit. And it was very hard for me to be granted the permit. For a long time I thought that this... that the passport was the most important thing. Look how badly they make them... they get all torn like cheap cardboard. In developed countries they make them of flexible fabric... I though the passport was the most important thing. But no, this is not really important. The important thing is this. See? See? Can you see it? Without this... without this there is nothing. This card was very hard to get because I had to borrow two thousand francs, deposit the money in a bank to obtain a certificate, and only after that could I apply for a work permit renewal. I was only able to apply for residency after I renewed several work permits. How are you comrade? Well, I'll have to tell the story from the very beginning again. It starts in Argentina. Excuse me. Sure, go ahead... go ahead please. The story starts in Argentina, when I realized I would have to leave because things weren't working out for me... Hello, how are you? Hello. Do you know anything about my job? I'm freezing out here. Look, I told him already... and this guy is the one making the contact. Could I borrow ten francs, please? I will pay you back as soon as I can. Sure, see you later, then... Please hurry up! Hello. There is nothing about Chile here. Hey, is the Argentinean guy still busy? I want to talk to him about that job for the comrade... He is ready, but I already talked to him. Did you? Yes. And this other guy also spoke with him, and it's been like five people who have already talked to him. Sure, but I have a moral commitment to the comrade... so I will insist now with him... And I will talk to him, because this is an urgent case. Okay. Hey, look, they handed me this envelope with some money for these people. I think you can give it to them. Yes. Sure, no problem, listen... I can make sure they receive the envelope. Look, I have a little problem with el Negro Godoy... he left without paying the phone bill, and he called everywhere. So, I think I could take some money from here to pay for those things. But there are different funds to pay for the phone bills. Sure, but it takes such a long time to get reimbursed, so I was thinking of taking some money from here, and then repay it once I get reimbursed. But I will give you a detailed receipt, okay? Look, I don't know. Do it if you want to, I already gave you the money. I know, but I am just explaining it to you... You know... to do the right thing. We have to start from the beginning, and that was in Kishinev, Russia, then in Romania, and then in Russia again. Did you ever hear about the Jewish gaucho? That was my great grandfather, who came to Argentina in 1845. They gave him lands and he would dress like a gaucho to farm them. They would speak yiddish amongst themselves, and were referred to as the Jewish gauchos. A musical show about them is in the works, it's going to be a hit... after "Fiddler on the Roof". Eh... the Jewish gauchos never thought that their... great grandchildren would return to Europe! There were ten thousand dollars in here... now there's only nine thousand eight hundred... Since I'm not the one that will be using this money... I have to give it to comrade Carlos, and since comrade Carlos is not responsible for using this money he, in turn, will hand it to comrade Luncho... and since comrade Lucho is not responsible either for using this money, he will hand this to comrade... Hey pal, do you have the list with the questionnaire for the magazine? I think Aquiles has it. He's in the bathroom. Aquiles. Yes? Do you have the list? What list? The list of questions for the Magazine Plan. No, Rocio has it. Rocio, could you give me the list? Sure, here you go. Hey pal, what do you say we talk about this questionnaire? Because I think that some modifications should be made... Let me see. As we discussed the other day, we agreed on the layout and on the articles that will be inserted there. We had the Editorial, a report on the Security Committee, an analysis of the economic policy of the Military Junta, a political report on a resistance movement. They have covered almost all the movements... I think it is the turn now of the revolutionary left movement. Assorted news, some out of Chile about the resistance, the economy, an in-depth analysis of the three years of the government. Here we would include the inserts with questions... I don't understand why I am treated differently, since I am Chilean too. I am a brother of you all. Sure, I'm not a leftist but a socialist, like everyone else, right? Because everyone is a socialist. We have socialism here in France. In Spain we have socialists too. Mussolini was also a Socialist, he also believed in society. I think that we're all like a big family, and I am a family man too! And Plan Z was a reality, my daughter was about to be sent to Russia! And you can't tell me that isn't Socialism, can you? Thank you. I got into one of those things one gets caught into... A sociologist who was conducting a survey on the dreams of the exiled people asked me to write down the dreams of some twenty exiled people, which I did. But I think that these dreams are rather Freudian. For example, I had a dream the other day, myself, in which I went to meet my father at los Cerrillos, the airport in Santiago. He was flying there from somewhere else. And instead of seeing his plane, I spotted the Graff Zeppelin... hovering overhead, and instead of my father, Pinochet descends. A band starts to play and the President shows up, but the one dressed as the President was actually the mayor of Villa Alemana. And when they were hugging, the pair of bastards started to kiss and roll around on the floor. In the end, we felt so disgusted that we jumped on the Zeppelin and took off. ...though there are different political groups, there is a certain unity which will eventually prevail. But this should not be an obstacle for a critical analysis of the coup's significance, from the perspective of our departure. Sure, but I still think that we should highlight that the resistance movement is unified... You aren't allowed to ask where these came from, okay? I hope I didn't bother you with this emergency... Do you remember that Chilean family we had to get out of the country in such a hurry? We sent them money, and we didn't receive any news from them after that. I'm worried. I don't know what to say to all those that cooperated. You dealt with dishonest people. Dishonest... I wouldn't have thought about that. In these cases, problems usually occur. People are not saints, and these things happen everywhere. Things don't work out that way! We have been helping our friends in the Third World for a long time. Why do you say "Third World"? Because the worst things always happen to them, in their countries or here. Besides, they don't reason like we do. That is racism. They are only human beings with problems. Excuse me, ladies, I was walking by and couldn't help overhearing. First of all, I would like to tell you that nobody appreciates your efforts to help the Third World more than me. But I have to warn you, to some extent you are fooling yourselves. For two reasons, that might be coincident but that... are opposites at the same time. First of all... the most common experiences of modern man, certain impermanence, a certain trans-culture, a certain feeling of passing through, was made by Latin Americans. I say this regarding all the Third World, at least regarding Latin Americans, rather than referring to Europeans. Because in the end we are all mestizos. Secondly, what Latin Americans envy the most about Europe is exactly what Europe is trying get rid of, and with great difficulty. I'm referring to certain forms of super development. It's a situation we could compare to the one that you, lady, experienced years ago, when you were poor and stopped by the window of Balenciaga, and stared at an expensive, fashionable model that you liked but could not afford. And now when you can afford it, you realize that that model is not fashionable any more. What's the name of this construction site? This is the peripheral boulevard, the one that circumvents the whole city... A great technological advance. It prevents cars from going downtown. Can you imagine the traffic jams if all cars were to go downtown? In Chile we were going to do something like this, remember? It never got finished. Hey, how about that turn? It's the same thing, cars coming from the outside, from-small towns. They don't need to enter the city to get to the other side. Let's say this is a solution that creates another problem. But this is due to the number of cars, which is not the case in Chile. Here everyone has a car. Did you tell me something about the military being involved in the construction of the highway in Chile? There were people who said that the real reason was to construct a ring road to control eventual riots. A strategic solution for surrounding worker's demonstrations, and controlling the situation quickly, unlike what happened on April 2nd when it took them more than three hours. Shit, we are having problems again! We are having personal conflicts here again. It was a political fight this time... Nothing political, asshole, it's personal issues that are getting hotter in here. Look, you know what? We have to call a meeting, an assembly of all the comrades. But these problems, as you said, are not political. Dammit, but this can't go on like this! Look, there was this argument the other day amongst three socialists, two from the MAPU, a communist, and two communists and one radical on the other side. So, why do we need to keep on fighting then? Where is the political reasoning? Personal conflicts are arising here. No, it's because for a month... two months, they've been locked in the embassy... Okay, I'm not arguing that, because of all the time they've been locked in they are letting off some steam. But they are going a little too far now! Right on time! I was looking for you. Where have you been? I just waited for an hour at the police station, and I still can't get the residency papers. Hey, what's the matter with him? When I got here he was asleep. Then he woke up, said something, and went back to sleep. What's the matter with him? He is on a hunger strike. Why? His is sort of crazy, like all Chilean people. He still has not obtained his residency papers. I have to leave. Please, take care of him. Bye Luis. Hey Pancho, buddy, Pancho. At least sit up straight... you're not at home. What's the matter, asshole? Look, there are certain things that we need to make clear, certain points we need to clarify, once and for all. For example, the issues with your hunger strike. I understand your reasons, but I don't support your tactics. I don't think that's the way of protesting. These people are to be taken as they are, don't cry for the moon! They are doing as much as they can to help us! So let's not give them additional problems! Listen, comrade, I'm going to tell you two things. First, I'm not asking for a job for myself. I am asking for jobs for all those who came with us. For all those bastards who arrived here starving. Second, nobody will move me an inch from here, and I will stay here until the last consequences. I am prepared to make a mess in here, a real mess! Understood? Look, comrade. Let's go step by step. As for getting jobs for our people, right? I am not asking for a job just for you, or me, but for all the Chileans who are here. But we need to take small steps first, we can't achieve everything immediately! Now, in regards to your second point about making a mess. What do you mean by "making a mess", eh? What will you achieve? To get arrested and expelled from the country by the 'flics'? No man, we can't help you under those conditions. The 'flics' man... the flics... Don't try to scare me with the flics, man! I was at the 'house of laughter', I already know about that. Look, comrade. Let's not brag about our 'resume' about the National Stadium, the torture, Chaihuin and all that crap. If we started I could easily ask who left and who didn't leave with an authorization from the party, so let's cut the crap right now! Shit! We are really going the wrong way comrade. We are not going to get anywhere with this attitude! Dammit, comrade! Of course we are not going to get anywhere. At least just stay put there, man. Okay, just let me get some sleep, you asshole! But take it easy, man. Well, in my dream I was on a street... a street very much like Independencia Recoleta, or Santiago Rivas, and there was a fire. And the firemen showed up wearing ties, not wearing their uniforms, I mean... wearing only their regulation helmets. And they broke into the house, and began to throw a pile of books through the window. Then a man showed up at the door and told us to come closer, because he knew who had started the fire. And that the fire was started to hide a crime that had been committed in the building. And, he said there was a body under a truck, and next to the body was a set of bronze tools, big candlesticks, all covered in blood. The dead man's face was covered with flies at the time. Then he suddenly made a quick gesture to scare them away... and I said: "Well, this man is not dead after all". Your name, please? Juan. Juan what? Juan, just Juan. You were an activist back in Chile, right? I think that is rather irrelevant... Did you work back in Chile? Yes, as everyone else did. Did you have a special job... a specific job? We all had specific jobs in Chile, because everyone works there... Could you give me a general impression of the Chilean economy? I would have to ask about that first. Ask whom, or what? Well, we have released a statement, you can read it if you want to. A humanitarian statement? Yes, a humanitarian statement. Excuse me. Hello friend, how are you? How do you feel here? I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm very happy. I have never done things like this... I have never ironed. One can always learn new things, which is good. It's important to do something in order to be happy. What do you think about this Saturday's party in your honor? I think it is great that they are throwing me a party, I'm really happy... Look, I wanted to ask you a favor. I would like to give a little speech at the party. About what? Exactly, I want you to listen to me, and tell me what you think, okay? Perfect, I will listen to you. "Some events have occurred in Chile that have divided the Chilean family." "The Chilean family was split apart because of the hatred that was seeding." "This enormous crisis that our family is undergoing..." "Is no one's fault, but just a trick of fate." "And if we could find a person responsible for this," "if we had to blame someone," "it would be foreigners." "It is the foreign interference that has caused this enormous crisis." "But, I raise my glass to toast, and thank you for your warm welcome." "And even though I am not left-wing," "you have treated me greatly, and you have opened your arms to me." "I have come here to bring a message from the Chilean Junta," "but I will bring back to the world a message of peace..." "a message of love from the exiled people here in France." Dammit! Shit. To transform these shoeboxes into homes they are sending people away. Greedy bastards, goddamn capitalism! You have to be a son of bitch! They bring laborers from Africa to achieve a better return. They don't care about the working class... they don't give a shit! Look where the earnings go! Greedy scumbags, they fucked up all the nice rooftops in Paris. You fucking thieves! Sleaze balls... Exploiters! This is horrible, this is horrible! All the beautiful rooftops that Paris was known for have been fucked! Look, look! We can't even see Notre-Dame because of that fucking tower! Several days had gone by when I learned that my husband was imprisoned, but still alive. I went to the embassy, and was granted asylum. I was there for three months. Then one day, I saw my brother through a glass window. That was the last time I saw him, because he was found dead on the street some time later. And here I am now, that's all. Recently she heard the story of a woman... who was searching for her husband everywhere. She didn't know whether he was in prison, dead or alive. So, she went to the prison, and they told her he was there. She went inside and they raped her. Then they told her he was dead. The woman collected his body and buried him. Then they arrested her and raped her again. Now she is insane. You are lucky to be here alive, aren't you? All of this is very sad, but I can't help you right now. Could you leave your address so that we can locate you, if anything changes? Sure. Well, we are starting our class late again. I want to warn you that this is the last time that this occurs. Arteaga, please sit here in the front as soon as you finish greeting your friends. You were one of the students who didn't pay much attention. Well, the last time we were just beginning to dig into the '91 civil war. We are going to resume there. I think we should summarize what we discussed yesterday. Could you do the summary? Well, the best summary of the '91 civil war is a telegram kept in the library of the British Museum... a telegram from the British ambassador... What's your name? Martinez. In which the ambassador simply says: "We have won". He obviously gave away the complicity among the British imperialism, that he represented, the seditious military men and the oligarch congressmen who rebelled against the government of President Balmaceda. I object, this is a history class, not a political meeting! There's always an excuse, like this ordinary history class, to do politics! I came here to perform at the Olympia, and I took the opportunity to call your attention to this maneuver that is being orchestrated. So you blame Moscow for the '91 war. Well, because they are to blame for it! You have been warned! I was afraid of Mr Arteaga coming here. You insisted, so you will be the ones to solve this problem. I don't know whether you have anything to say, as the class president? Well, we, the alumni council, have adopted a resolution. As president of the alumni council of the Instituto Nacional, I want to welcome, once again, the alumni. Unfortunately, this time we can't meet in the conference room of our beloved Instituto. So, we have had to appeal to the generosity of our friends, who have offered us this place. This year we will have to grieve the absence of five comrades killed in action, and of three deserters. We have to add that comrade Arteaga won't be present next year, because our alumni council has decreed his expulsion in a unanimous resolution. We want to make it clear that he never displayed bad behavior, and that our respect is with him. That's the resolution we have taken. I think it is clear enough that you have to leave now. But I would like to stay for the lunch party that we have every year, and hang out with the comrades. And the dinner party... is it still on for tonight? Everyone signed this expulsion, but my signature is missing! When Fabian Luna came back to his hotel after two weeks of absence, he learned from the news that he had been kidnapped. He quickly took advantage of this for propaganda purposes. Well, let's resume the class. Do you want to say something? I believe, comrades, my friends, that the time has come to reflect out loud. The problems our comrades have had with Arteaga will continue to occur regularly, in the future. Because in the end we are all humans, and when our human nature is touched we don't know how to react. After this, retaliations will come. After this more than one comrade in Chile will be imprisoned, or will be killed, and, as usual, we, ourselves are going to get hurt. So, I encourage my comrades to reflect once more on this. When someone is about to be punished, and since we are human beings with feelings, there is always a comrade who is against it or who is moved. I do not want to give you phrases for posterity right now, but I do want us to think about this. What is hurting us, comrades, is humanism. Humanism is screwing us. I want all comrades to reflect on this. Yes, but we have already learned of several bloody events... Excuse me for interrupting, but this is an urgent situation. I have been waiting for you for three hours! Tomorrow I will be thrown out of my house, so I need to speak with you to solve this situation. I beg you to wait for me for a minute, because I'm going over a very important topic. I beg you to wait for me for a minute, and I will be there right away. Excuse me. The problem here is that, on one hand, it's impossible to help everyone, and on the other hand... money has been sent, and it seems that it was never received... I mean, the money was delivered quickly but no news has been received after that. Let me clarify this, they have given money to particular individuals who were not necessarily the appropriate ones. All we want is that all the efforts that are being made in Europe... are properly channeled, according to the purposes we have as a resistance movement. Now, we believe that they also agree... I think we both agree that the money should be as useful as possible... For the entire movement, for the unity of the resistance. That's the idea. I mean, if we don't receive the money, who are the ones that manage it in order to strengthen the unity of the resistance... Well, it may be useful for some, comrade, but it will not perform the function that we want, which is freeing our country, once and for all. Hello comrade, how are you? Hello. Have you been waiting a long time? No, I just got here. Excuse me for a moment please. Mr. Edgardo, can you come here for a minute please? Sure, I'll be there. This is comrade Pancho, I would like to introduce him to you. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - Will you excuse me now? - Sure, go ahead. So, how's everything? I was told you finally got your work permit, so everything seems to be fine, right? Yes. Well, there are some steps to go through... now the work permit... you will soon be a French worker... so keep moving up, okay! Good luck. Thanks a lot. Finally! That was hard. Look, there are certain things I would like to explain now... Cut to the chase, man. Look, I know it is complicated, I know it's difficult. Things here are so much more different from back home. Totally. So, we will probably stop seeing each other for a while. But, you will come here to see us every once in a while... Of course, but you know that everyone belongs to their own social class here, right? Sure, everyone in their own class! Excuse me, could I talk to you for a minute? Comrade, the meeting is about to begin. Could you introduce the new comrade? Yes, I think I could. The meeting is about to begin... shall we? We are going to be a part of the working class now, Lucho. Well, anyway... I think we will meet again in the future, in another battle, another war! So it will be during the next revolution! But don't take it like that. I'm just saying... Dialogues of Exiles is the first film directed in France by Raoul Ruiz, then a political refugee. It was shot in 1974 and released on French screens in 1975. In 2015, using the original 16mm and soundtrack, it was digitized and restored by the Mikros Image lab, with the support of François Ede and Valeria Sarmiento.
