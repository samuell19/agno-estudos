Evening, Ralph. - Want something to eat? - No, thanks. You're just great. You look more like a movie star than a car designer. Sorry about that. Hey listen Ralph, just a second. Look, I already told you it's just not something I'd do. Monsignor Korda you're making a big mistake. You refuse a fortune. Don't waste your time here. Hey listen Ralph, just have a look at these slides. Now if you won't look at them, I'm gonna have to hand them in the way they are. They have to be in tomorrow morning. Taxi! Can I drop you off somewhere? No, thanks. I've really gotta have them in tomorrow morning. Okay, lemme have them. But give me back the ones you don't like, - don't throw them away. - Don't worry. - See you. - I'll phone ya. That's a good girl. - May I? - Sure. Korda, is that you? Plastic toys and ping-pong balls. I thought you made cars. Looks like a factory or something. Do you really live here? Oh excuse me please, Mr. Korda. Something up? No no, I didn't know that you had a visitor with you. That's alright. When can I have a word with you? Not now. No, of course not. Goodnight. Why do you live in an old dump like this? Living here would scare the shit out of me. That's a new car? Just about. There's champagne in the fridge. Did you bring any glasses? That really you with those naked girls? - That's for Playboy. - Mmm, great. I know one of them, Miss Blue Eyes. Look, there's this car again. Why is it covered up? Top secret. - Get rid of everything. - Huh? That's what turns the people on. Hey, leave it on. It doesn't bother me. Take that off. That too. Mr. Korda! Mr. Korda, just a minute! Just a minute! Good morning, I thought you'd drop into my office. The Kordan is tying up three machines. Now it's practically at a standstill. Either we're producing Kordan or else. We will produce Kordan. Yes, but when and how many? I'm late, I must be going. With your father, things ran a lot differently. That's why you're here. That's why I pay you; keep things running. And what about our ping pong ball production, Mr. Korda?! The government has tricked us with false promises in order to sell the land to BAG behind our backs. The Berlin Automobile Group told us lies when they said they weren't interested in this property. Now, the deal's gone through and that means goodbye to our youth center. For years, we've been subsidized and the KOZ Youth Center was used as the model for other offenders around the country. But now the cops are gonna put us back on the streets. Please, let me through! Mrs. Landauer, you're the official spokesperson - of the BAG company? - As I said, we acquired the land by legal means and we're already planning to build two new assembly plants over there. But isn't it true after these young people have put in years of hard work building up their own community youth clubs, now we hear the BAG company is intending to drive them out? I'd like to make it quite clear. Down with BAG! Save our center! Down with BAG! Save our center! - Excuse me. - We acquired it by legal means. We are going to build two new assembly plants over there soon. The whole thing is standard business procedure. The youths that have put so much work into the place and now most of them are without a job and a place to stay. You take away their new home and send them back on the streets; you call that a standard business procedure? You cannot dictate extension policy to us. We cannot make our own decisions concerning our own land and our own buildings, which will house new jobs, then we might have to ask ourselves if Berlin is the right place for the BAG company. Thank you. Clear the streets! This is a final warning. The purpose of our peaceful demonstration is to inform the public about the KOZ Youth Center's precarious situation. Our cities have become jungles and man is his own worst enemy. Our homes are slums, unfit for decent families to live in. There aren't enough playgrounds or recreational areas. Our youth center used to be a shining example of community living for creative, responsible people. But all they wanna do is... Any idea of what they're actually after? - They're all nuts. - Pollute the air with death. They could stand a punch in the mouth. Today they'll destroy our youth centers. Tomorrow, the whole world! Our cities are already jammed full of cars, but they keep building bigger and bigger. Stop the gas guzzlers and give the cities back to the people! - You bastard! - Pig, pig! - You bastard! - Bastard! - I'm sorry. - No, sorry. Dr. Hein is in a meeting. No, I don't know when he'll be through. Yes. Yes, just a minute. Mr. Muhle can't come to the phone either. Yes, you can try a little later. Mrs. Kraus, I must speak to Mr. Von der Muhle. - It's very urgent. - No, I can't. I want the area to be cleared out immediately. But we're doing all we can. We must not let those squatters interfere with our plans. - I don't wanna be disturbed. - Can I use the phone? It's very important. Can I use the phone? It's very important! Could you both come in here please? No, you must make an appointment first. - That's alright. - The mayor is anxious to see. I'd like to know how the hell they got those slogans up there. I suppose they climbed up the smokestack. They climbed up the smokestack. I could see that myself, but what were your guards doing then? Can you imagine if something had happened to the Worldcar? I'll recheck all the safety measures. The security system. Maybe you think I'm an idiot, - but your accumulator test was. - I know what I'm doing. Let's check the test shocks again. Alright. Test is the only way to be sure. You are absolutely right; you are a slow coach. It's an electro-chemical car, but you have to test it like a regular combustion engine and charge the speed. You see, it's a theater project. We wrote a rock opera that we're producing. It has interesting elements like paintings and sculpture groups. You mean you written an opera all by yourself? Not really an opera, not the kind that you think. It's really not music. It's all just a lot of noise. If I had anything to say... Hey hey hey, how you doin', grandpa? Shit, you're too old to appreciate it. You've also been given an eviction notice. Nothin' to do with these kids. You run a little repair garage here, right? No comment. But how do you feel about being evicted, - losing the garage? - Nothing to say. Mischunke is an idiot. Anyway, what's all this TV shit? You'll just screw us in the end as usual. Then why do you want to remain here? That's a stupid question, I live here. But the company has rights too. Hey, Frank! - Hey, you were really terrific! - Boy, is she a natural. Hey hey hey, hey! Hey Frank, that was great. Mr. Adam, you are the project leader in this youth group. What are planning to do now? Project Vader, my ass. The kids did the whole thing by themselves. What's going to happen now? Now it's their move. Thank you. - Okay. - That's it. Here are the shots from the second accumulator. The voltage goes down too fast. This was taken at 130ks. No, that was the other test. I'll try it again. Now let's see. - Come over here, Ralph. - Not now. At this speed, all the membranes burnt there and there. Don't you even wanna have a look at it? No. Heat as a patient just isn't working. Look, the accumulator. We still have too much loss. Look out, the accumulator. Ralph, the accumulator! You can junk it. Take the other one. Where could you drive faster than 150 nowadays? Would you by a Porsche that could only do 150ks? I'd never buy a Porsche. I drive a BAG. I wanna know if Kordan can be oxidized even more strongly. Just give me the other pictures again. The ones we made with the American microscope. Do you think Kordan's at fault? Rubbish. I want to improve the conduction. That would solve the problem of overheating too. I'll have the safe opened. Thanks. Why are you driving the Acura in there? Send it up into the lab. I want a concise investigation. - Hey! - What? Where are the flow pictures and the rest of the stuff? Did you take out the portfolio? Me? No. That's great, really great. But I could never do that. It's something everyone should be able to do nowadays. They didn't teach this kinda stuff in my day. Right just get in that position, then you'll get the hang of it. See? The accumulator file is missing. What, from the safe? My god! Nonsense, management picked it up today. I opened the safe. I see. Don't let me interrupt ya. Bodybuilding, right? Got to keep in shape. Sure, may I? The main thing is to keep your head between your hands. Von der Muhle. What's that? No. No, of course not. Why on earth should I have taken the file? Okay. Von der Muhle says he doesn't know anything about it. Nobody said he did. You said that the files were handed over to management. Yes, I meant Dr. Hein. We're here at the station, which is part of the magnetic train's test track. We'll be interviewing the chief engineer who is with me now. This enterprise is run by a private company. But it is partially... Come and listen to this. Also a grant from the city of Berlin. We've also had financial support. Tell me, what's going on? The magnetic train is designed for mass transportation. You see, we're using the old trolley tracks but with an important difference: the vehicle has no motor or wheels and glides along without touching the track. There's no driver. It's all driven and controlled by computer and it's extremely safe. One might say it's really the vehicle of the future from every point of view. But do you think that this new technology could be an alternative to cars? Yes, of course. There are smaller models. Can you imagine a vehicle that takes you automatically to your destination? There are up to 18,000 automobiles that come visit this country every year. Rubbish. I can't listen to that anymore. Is a scandal. One-sided, unscientific, misinformed. That woman won't get in here again. I'd speak to her editor. You have the construction plans, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, that's right. - We need them for rechecking. - Who ordered that? I did. The board requires them to come to a decision immediately. Oh Mrs. Landauer, would you mind? We had to decide whether Worldcar's going to be built or not, you know that. I thought that was my job, Dr. Hein. Please, don't take it so personally. I can't just sit on it. A great deal of money has been spent on this project without any results. We've nearly reached our goal. I can only put to the committee projects that are commercially viable and realistic. This project is realistic, only you haven't the vision to see it. The Worldcar will be a world sensation. We won't have to depend on oil, no noise, no fumes, ecologically-sound. In addition, it'll have a long lifespan and will hardly require any servicing. You really want to put on the market a car that can do only 150 kilometers an hour? We need the file, sir. You'll get it as soon as possible. We were just discussing the basic strategy for the Worldcar. Besides that, I need new accumulators. Gone through another one? What do you think one of those things cost? That doesn't impress me in the least. If you're short of them, that's your problem. The company going on back burner or something? Check out our contract. If Worldcar's not in production by the end of the year, then I'm taking Kordan out of the deal. Ralph, come now. You'll get everything you really want. 1,000 Worldcars by the end of the year or I'm packing it in. You can just wait and see how accumulators do. What's wrong, you wanna hold up the Kordan production? The keyword is built. There is no mention in the contract about 1,000 units. There is a temporary stop on issuing accumulators. Is that so? Until the board makes a decision. If the project should fail, then you'll be the one to answer for it. Hey Niki not that one, only BAGs. - A car's a car. - You're wrong. Only BAGs if the plan is to work. Say Carol, no names. They're just initials, so piss off. Isn't that beautiful? A real nice car. Here, you'll look great in this. We got the stuff, the whole correspondent. But you never know, there may be copies around. Yeah sure, drawings, blueprints, even stuff from his father. Yeah? Yeah. Nobody else lives in the factory, just an old caretaker. Yeah no security, nothin'. Nothin' to worry about. Right, see you then tomorrow. Kellermann, he's been waiting for 1/4 of an hour. So what? Outside on the pier. It's always better to meet in a public place like this. I'm dissatisfied with you, Mr. Kellermann. I made him your offer; I really can't do more. I'm not yet finished. You haven't obtained the rights to Kordan. What can I do? He's not interested, that's all. He... Will you kindly let me finish? He has become mistrustful. Frankly, so have I. You've been bidding for other parties. You tried to jack up the price. I told you from the beginning that there were other bidders. And who guarantees me that you're not working hand-in-glove with Korda? Get me Worldcar. You got exactly 24 hours. And if not? It would be a great pity. Ralph tell me, why did you switch the engines? Oh coffee, thanks. It's too fast. You're gonna put the slower one back in? On a trial basis. We haven't tested it completely. - I must be dreaming; Ralph... - I said I'd give it a try. Let's go before you change your mind. - Did you ring, Mr. Korda? - Yes, please. Very good. - Hello, Mrs. Landauer. - Hello. - Hello, Marie. - Oh Ralph, couldn't reach you last night. You probably had a visitor. - What's up? - I don't know exactly. But yesterday at the board meeting, Dr. Hein pulled an Iranian sheik out of his sleeve. He's supposed to bind to BIG in a big way. I'm sorry, Marie. I am in a hurry. I have to go to the lab. I trust they're to your liking. Mmm, they're wonderful. - Thank you. - Good. Crayfish are rare these days. Yes, they're becoming extinct unfortunately. When I was young, we used to catch them ourselves in Little River in the vicinity of the boarding school; but I didn't care for them there. One's taste in certain things changes as one gets older. I didn't know you had freshwater crayfish in Arabia. I was educated in England. But getting back to Worldcar, if you support me in this matter... As I was saying if you support me in this matter, then I will propose that you remain chairman of the board with 25% of all shares. I do believe my word will count. You know of course that I'm committed to your plan. But nevertheless, it is not going to be easy. What's easy in this world? Marie? How did you get up here? Give me a drop to drink. Cup of tea? No, for once a cognac. Look at the way you live. Won't you ever grow up? I know, it's just a game. All your girls, your cars, even your invention. But I'm not just buying this, Ralph. You're playing and playing around. You're fooling yourself. We're not getting any younger. Stop it. I have to get up my courage 'cause I want to sleep with you. Come and get undressed. Marie, when a woman comes on too hard. I know you're no sweetheart. Don't you like me anymore? Just within the moment. You smell good. What is it? It's me. # What would it mean # # Changing the scene # # Is it all just killing cars # # Just killing cars # # Ooh just killing cars # # Just killing cars # Hey, how 'bout giving back the money I lent you? I need it now! - You wanna play too? - Ah, shit. - I need some bread. - Where are you going? - Well that cleans me out. - That's how it goes. Let's watch the last 15 minutes. Yeah, okay. Anyway I saw it again last night. - Another one? - Backgammon? - Uh huh. - I've had enough for now. - 20 marks, 30. - Another time. Tell me, Miss. Do you always ram other people's cars? It was nothing. You think I'm stupid? You just bumped my car. - Where? - Right here. Is that what you meant? Here's my card in cast you have any problems. For a woman you drive quite well. You'll get over it. So it's that bloody car. Hey, stop that man! Stop, thief! Stop! Stop that man! - Hey you bastard, stop! - Catch him! Hold it! Hold it right there! - C'mere, you! - Ooh, catch him! Call the police! Let me through! How 'bout some service? Got some bread for me? Yeah. - Hey, that's a rat. - So what? - It still eats. - Take the bread and get that disgusting thing out of here. Ooh, kiss my ass. - Lemme have a go. - Hey lay off it, will ya? - Come on. - Lay off it, I said. Would you get your hands off it? I said get off of it. What, are you tryin' to break the fuckin' thing? - Hey, c'mon. - Leave it alone, will ya? I said leave it alone. Buchowski, come here. Come here! Buchowski! We're expecting great things from Worldcar. Quite an ingenious invention you've come up with, Mr. Korda. It wasn't my idea. My father hit on it. He made synthetics. He was working on solid iron conductors on a polymer basis and suddenly he had the Kordan. I don't believe it was quite that accidental. Mrs. Al-Atassi, Mr. Al-Atassi, dear friends. Don't be frightened, I'm not going to make a speech. But I do wanna use this opportunity to give thanks that we can enjoy this most beautiful and magnificent view of our city and an outlook on a glorious future. Senator, my dear friend, I would like to take this opportunity of thanking you for this wonderful setting you've prepared. Mr. Korda, I tried to reach you several times. My offer still stands. If my information is correct, things are not looking too good for your project. Mr. Kellermann, I'm not selling. Kordan will change the world. Sir Korda. Thank you. I offer you 100 million. You're Mr. Korda? Yes, I thought so. I saw your picture in the paper. My name's John B Mahoney, I live in New York and I have certainly heard a lot about you. Your transmission system with plastic accumulator could be very interesting for America. - Excuse me. - Of course. Should we go? We're a pretty big company with a wide line of products. Food, airplanes, cars. May I give you my card? Thanks. See ya. Nice to meet you, Mr. Korda. Let's go somewhere. Dancing? Okay. Finished? Not bad. Not finished. Yes. I want one too. Get dressed and beat it. Ah, there's another one. Greetings to BAG. Sexy. Fantastic. Right outta Star Wars. # Killing cars # # Just killing cars # - Peter! - Hey Ralph, there's a new code. - Why's that? - New security measure. Say, where have you been all afternoon? The new code, open it for me. I can't, I haven't been given that code myself. You can enter that lab only with the direct permission of Dr. Hein. Let me out of here. Let me out of here, I said! No, Ralph! Leave me alone! Ralph, Ralph. Ralph! Ralph, what are you doing? Ralph. Ralph! Research department. What the...? Hold the main gate. He went crazy; I don't know what's got into him. - Get outta the car. - Keep your hands up. What do you think you're doing? You're sabotaging the whole enterprise. I'm fighting for this project with you. I won't let myself be locked out. The truth is you simply locked yourself out. You've also hurt me into the bargain. I can't go on without an accumulator. Why don't you go on sick leave for a few weeks? You know my hands are tied to the meeting of the board, but I have a good chance to take the job over from Dr. Hein. What's up with him? What's wrong with you? That talk about 1,000 units; it's impossible. He read me your contract, but there's no mention of 1,000 units. 1,000 Worldcars 'til year's end or I take my hat. You got that from me in written form! No. Take a look at your correspondence. Ralph! You are not eating anyting. Something wrong with your hors d'oeuvres? I won't say that I'm not interested in your offer. 100 million is a tidy sum. What does bother me is the fact that I'll have absolutely no influence with what happens with Kordan. My client will build accumulators with it like before. Could also let the patent gather moss. Why should he? Who is your client? For him, it's money in the bank. It's not the money that interests me. I wanna see Worldcar on the market on every street in the world. My client, he manages sole rights to Kordan so that nobody can get there first. - Hello, Mr. Korda. - Hi. I need a decision, Mr. Korda by Friday evening. I'll call you. Just a moment. I hope I didn't chase Mr. Kellermann away. The check please. I'll have an omelet and an orange juice. That guy is one of the biggest arms dealers in the world. You're a romantic, Miss Blum. The world is full of arms dealers and shadowy characters. Six years ago, I did some research - on Kellermann for Spiegel. - From Spiegel? The District Attorney investigated Kellermann, but they couldn't pin anything on him. Do you know what UF6 is? Some kind of sex hormone? Uranium hexafluoride. UF6 is an essential ingredient for the enhancement of uranium for atomic weapons. Kellermann illegally exported a plant to Pakistan at the start of the 80s. UF6 is quite definitely on the list of non-exportable atomic material. But they couldn't pin it on him? The plant was supposed to be for the manufacture of fluoride toothpaste, so much for hygiene. Are you selling off your Worldcar to Kellermann? Do you need stories for? I think it would be a waste of videotape. It makes no difference if the streets are jammed with gas guzzlers or your genial Worldcar. - You wanna ban our cars? - Just its bad side. You people were always screaming for an ecologically sound car. Well it's my Worldcar. What about the effects on the environment? Have you considered that? I don't give a damn about the environment. I'm a technologist. I just build engines. I couldn't care less for clean energy, believe me. That's really very considerate of you, but the power has to come from some source. Recipe atomic energy. Harrisburg, Hiroshima. I wouldn't mind windmills. The nature freaks make a lotta wind. It could become a tornado that would blow all the crap away. Now, leave it alone. - What gives with you? - Don't feel like it. Why not? They didn't do anything to us. I thought you wanted to get at BAG! That doesn't hurt BAG. It hurts people without changing anything. - Actually, he's right. - Let's grab some BAG people. - Come on then! - Hey Niki, wait for us. - What's up? - Shh, not so loud. We'll think of something. Are you nuts? What about the security guards? Will you shut up? That referee was half blind, I tell ya. Buchowski, shh. How does that feel? Hey, what are you doing? Here, suck it. - No alcohol under 18. - I'm 18. Hey. Here, catch. - Enough for an army. - Here's a few more. Throw me one. C'mon, c'mon. Hey, I don't think I got my driver's license on me. Why wasn't the alarm system in the lab working? It was damaged by Korda and hasn't been repaired yet. It's not our fault. Oh go to bed, I don't want to see you anymore. Tell me, should the police be notified? This is an internal matter. We must avoid a scandal at all costs. You always covered up for Korda anyway. Would you rather that Kordan taken the project somewhere else? Anyway, for you it was always no more than theories. We never really gave it enough money. What did you actually expect to get out of such a venture? What will happen to our suppliers, the technicians, the electronic people? I guess we switch to something else. The parts manufacturers, the designers, - the oil companies. - The oil companies? The Arabs would invest them billions in far less risky businesses. - What are you trying to say? - What are you trying to say? - Where's the car? - You know where. Ralph, you surely don't think we're the ones who stole it, do you? - I stuck behind. - You work that nightly. First, you break down all the doors... You'll cut your own throat, Dr. Hein. Work somewhere else. You're suspended. Ralph, I don't know what to say anymore. If you have the car, bring it back as soon as possible. The board will be meeting in two days. Don't ruin things at the very last minute. You are overworked. What's wrong? They've taken the prototype. Taken, how? Who? Your proud company. That's not possible. I warned you. There's a briefcase in my desk in the lower drawer. Bring it to me. Why would I do that? There's an accumulator module in the briefcase. It'll be gone otherwise. Why don't you go to the police? What could they do, arrest Dr. Hein? Do you have a sleeping pill for me? I can't get to sleep. A half is enough. I halved it for you already. Don't worry, I'll find him. Mr. Brown? Oh, it's you. Sorry, I've got dirty hands. How could this happen? For sure did it because Hein relieved him of everything. Somehow I can understand it because he must have something in his hand, but not a word to the others. Hey, what the hell are you doin'? Yeah great, man. Give it all you got. Yahoo! This is the automatic answering device of Ralph. What are you doing here? The first thing I need is two minute's rest. You'll make me some coffee? Please. Kordan alone is no good to him. He needs the accumulator if he wants to continue. There is one inside the prototype. Now listen to me. There's this journalist, one of these committed environmentalist-types. She's determined to establish a clean car. She and her lefty colleagues or shall we say, her alternative friends, are holding the prototype. Korda has had a relationship with this person for some time, but she's pretty young. I'm not as intimate with him as you are. Please, leave me now. Shame; if you could just help me to find that car. I need more information. For example, about the stolen Worldcar. The editor has given me a free hand. It's great publicity for you and I'll have my story. There is no story. See you around. Do a nice story on the zoo. You're going to help us get Worldcar back. Me, how? Use your intimate relationship with Mr. Korda. You're really going a bit too far. You know that certain changes are being considered. The spokesperson is a figure of trust. Who knows? After the next board meeting, the spokesperson just might not be Marie Landauer. You do want to help us, don't you? - Ralph. - Is he hurt? Where did you get that cord? - Hello. - Mr. Korda. - Sort a funny place to live. - Why? In the middle of a highway. You a masochist? If the road was full of Worldcars, then there wouldn't be any problem. Nicely put. - Did someone threaten you? - Just a little accident. Homemade. The punks have the prototype. - Which punks? - From KOZ. You know that blond kid, the one with the skateboard? He isn't with KOZ anymore. Any idea where they're hanging out now? No, maybe near the old station. Can I use your car? Hey! # We're flying, we're flying # Driver, over there please. We wanna go slumming. Hey, they're goin' the wrong way. Ow, fuck! There's another one there. You idiot, I wanna get out. Fucking bastard! Stop the car! Let me outta here. Are you outta your mind? Don't get excited. I just came to get my car. I don't like people getting too close to me. At KOZ they told me that this used to be their hideout. Buchowski! Quiet. - Hide. - Why? Because I want to talk to him alone. You owe me a game. I don't owe you anything. I wanna get some sleep now. We can play for the car. If I win, you tell me where it is. If you win, you get some money. I don't need your money. - Maybe something else. - You'll only cheat me. I won't cheat you. Sorry about that. You stay here. Let's go. What is it now? - Where to? - To the repair garage - over there. - Okay. BAG had a lotta strength, a whole army. - Paging KOZ to Central. - Mark five. Better bring up another wagon, over. Roger, over. Hey Mark, hurry up with the coffee. Take the food containers along. - Mr. Adams. - Hi, Violet. What's going on around here? Just take a look at this. They've arrested everybody, everybody! Only authorized personnel are allowed here. It's okay, she's a reporter. Go on in. Mr. Mischunke. Mr. Mischunke! There you are. I need the tow truck right away. Nothing doing, I don't have time. Hey, who are you? And just who are you? Can you even drive something like that? Hey to the right, to the right! Are you trying to kill me? You were spotted. What's with the tow truck? That woman's no stranger to us, right Miss Blum? But Mr. Becker, Mr. Kraut. Hands up, both of you! - Get inside, come on. - Oh, no! Come on, hurry. Hurry! C'mon, against the wall. Against the wall. - Mr. Kraut, Mr. Becker. - I said, against the wall! Please, don't do that to me. You get to know the bad guys. Ooh! The guns. On your hands. Not hands up. I said on your hands, against the wall. I can't do that. Have a nice time. I don't think this is too good for me. Let me out of here! I was wondering why you called me and not your boss. Oh well, that's your business. But I must inform you of one thing: Mr. Hein has decided that the best policy of all would be destroy Worldcar. One of the people he has working for him is the owner of a demolition factory. But it's a pity to destroy the accumulator, don't you think? Go back to the office, get Mr. Schulz. - Why are we stopping? - Don't ask questions. Go on. We've only got a couple of minutes, so just do exactly what I tell you. Okay. - Where is Schulz? - No idea. Can't find him anywhere. - Hey, Ralph. - What? Someone just called you. You should go to the junkyard in the Kolochechik Street right away. Where's that? No no Mr. Kellermann, over here! Chief! Mr. Schulz! Hurry, get the car into the crusher. Leave the top on. Give it to me. Try somehow to climb up to the cabin. - What gives? - Go on! Don't worry about me. This is a real gun and it's loaded. Now I want you to lower that car and put it on the tow truck. Now back up carefully. - I'm bringing it back. - What are you bringing back? Oh it's you, Mr. Korda. - I can't let anybody in. - What do you mean? There was a board meeting today. Mr. Korda, don't make any trouble! Stop! Dr. Hein, I brought the Worldcar back. Dr. Hein, I found the Worldcar. Marie? Marie! Mr. Von der Muhle, Mr. Von der Muhle! I've got the Worldcar! It's there on the truck. - I can't do anything for you. - The prototype over there. Dr. Hein was voted in. Let the car be taken into safety. It can't just remain on the street. The project is canceled. Forget your Worldcar. I thought we were talking about the Kordan. Mr. Mahoney I wanna build a car, not some space vehicle. Look, Mr. Korda, we also build cars. I understand that branch, believe me. But the real action is going to be in space, your Kordan would just be wasted here on earth. But we live on this earth. Alright, I'll be frank with you. We have been working on the accumulator with plastic electrodes for the past 10 years, but your Kordan is lighter and much more energy efficient than anything we've come up with. Here, look at the sky. The future is up there. The space stations are getting bigger and we need matter accumulators. I've got to really think this over. What do you need to think over? This is a offer of a lifetime. You'd be crazy to sign that. You'll have to decide for yourself. May I have a drink? - Orange juice? - Cognac. - Oh. - I'll get it. We destroyed our earth and now we'll destroy space. I can't stop them. Build your car. Build your damn car, but not something in space! I'll do it. There you are, sir. Thanks. And here we are. Violet! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi. Violet, wait.
