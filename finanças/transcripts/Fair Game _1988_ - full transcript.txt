I guess you're looking for me. Frank? I wouldn't move if I was you. Don't even breathe. Easy. That's right. Come on, scientist. I saved your life. Watch where you step. I live in shit. Yes, that's right. We have to be nice to our guests. Where's the Mamba? It's over there. Perfect killing machine. Only about in one month out of the year, in the mating season. When the increase in its sex hormones causes an overproduction of venom so that it has to bite to free itself of the stuff. Love and death. And unless I've got it wrong, this is the mating season? Just another few days. Then it'll be good as gold till next year. But, uh, let's say it were possible to stimulate its present condition by injecting it with sex hormones, for example, giving it double, even three times its natural dose? What would happen then? Answer the question. I'm paying you for that too. The mamba would be so full of poison, it would die. Unless, of course, it got rid of the stuff into someone else's body within a period of time directly proportional to the quantity of hormones injected into it, right? It can sense its fear, its heartbeat. It's that that guides it. When the mamba locks in on a victim, it's dead meat. OK, Mr. Campbell. Game is over. And the ticket costs 5,000 bucks. And the ticket costs 5,000 bucks. Good work, Frank. You've just earned $5,000. I just doubled my price. I don't like this game you're playing. Money's in the car. I bet you don't want this little baby to play some game with. I don't like betting. Come on, get in. I'll give you a lift into town. All that money, the least you can do is buy me a drink, huh? He he he. Paylo, cut that out. Hey, you have to be more careful. This is a dangerous neighborhood. Stay there. You bad, bad cat. Here. Now get lost. One on one. Play a game that's so insane. One on one. Running for your life again. One on one. Never know just who's your friend. One on one. As it goes there's really no escape. What can you say about the kind of love we have when it turns to ashes 'cause it's slipping through your hands? Writing words upon the wall, if only we could see. Maybe certain things were really never meant to be. You turned away and finally broke my heart. Frank, meet Nancy and David. Jesus Christ, this door drives me bananas. Oh. God damn, Paylo. Don't try sneaking in through the skylight. Oh, no. From Middle Eastern Airlines, uh... No US air registration, air flights, you might never be heard from again. Hello. Hi, Meg. And furthermore... Yeah, I just got in. Sure, I'm working on it. I'm almost finished. Are prepared to deal with the issue of torture. What do you mean, change everything? I've already sent you the octopus... Octopess, I should say. She's perfect, isn't she? I mean, she's cute, funny. Was probably dead. Hmm, frightening. Well, isn't he enough? I could make him look meaner. But her? As much as a 400 page confession under torture. But we are making every effort to recover... No, I don't agree. Sure, you're the boss. I just wish I'd known earlier. Yeah. OK, can you give me 24 hours? All right. Bye. And they may be hearing it for the first time right now. Got a problem, pal? I've been told that in time it all will change. All in all it seems the story is still the same. Round and round in the circle we remain waiting for the day that we can all break away. So we lift our voices high, sing... The stars will sing into the sky so we may some day be as one. Singing to the... Where am I gonna put you, Moby Dick? Sky. Take that. No, it's just that Meg called. No, don't worry. Stop it, Kitty. Will you listen to me for a moment? I feel terrific, really. Yeah. Not with you around, I'm not. Sure. I'm OK, I guess... Under the circumstances. Yeah. No. He stopped calling. He wrote me a letter though. I see. You can imagine. I have to give him back X, Y and Z, seeing clothes list, that kind of stuff. Nah, I think he's accepted it now. I haven't heard a word for a week. No, not tonight, honey. I'm tired. Besides, I have to make my octopus uglier. Maybe tomorrow. I'll call you. Bye. Ah, yes, and yes, and yes, and yes would make us laugh at me. That guy is on my brain. He's driving me insane. Where's Freddy? Where's Freddy? Where's Freddy? Do do do de dee. Do do do de dee, where's Freddy? I wonder how that rumor ever got started. Kids want to be scared, eh? It's too fantastic to believe. Just think of it. Only this special unit and the President of the United States will know what happened here tonight. You mean, you think we know what's happened? Hello, police headquarters? This is Carter, Johnny Carter. Oh, sure. They're from another planet. What a night for young lovers Steve. Tyrrell and Gloria Castille. She thought I was kidding. Nobody will believe the invasion of the saucer men. All this... Kids want to be scared. To appoint himself chaperone of Lover's Lane. Oh, for Pete's sake. And a farmer with the longest shotgun you've ever seen plays the villain. What's so funny? Well, I... Christ, you scared me. Congratulations, sweetheart. It's almost me. I just came by to give you back the key to your enchanted castle. You could have rung the bell, you know. Well, now I'm here. Can I come in or should I go outside and wait? Make yourself at home. Hmm. Easier said than done. I never could bear your mess. Well, I'm a lot worse these days. I still think that you made an unforgivable mistake walking out on me. But I'm not going to go into that again. Good, 'cause I'm not about to listen to you even if you do. Well, well, well, our little innocence has grown claws. Give you a thrill, leaving me? Make you feel like a grown up? Yes. It's the best thing I ever did. And the most difficult. Hmm, well, it was perfectly timed, that's for sure. It was certainly perfectly timed. You weren't sitting quite so pretty when we met were you? You know, you've done it up very nicely, your little refuge. Please don't touch that. Got just what you wanted out of our relationship, didn't you? You know, no one would suspect that you were so pushy. So what do you want, a percentage of my earnings, or are you gonna sue me for damages? The damage you you did to me is incalculable. What's wrong? Can't you deal with the business parties alone? Those rooms full of people, small talk? Don't worry. Everything will be OK. You'll be OK, just... Just... just... just as soon as you find yourself another victim, some bright cheerful thing who can stand between you and the world. You're wrong, dear. It's not that easy to find a replacement. Besides, I detest replacements. I'm one to prefer memories. What are you doing here? What do you want from me? Don't you get lonely in this place? I got a lot lonelier on the 37th floor of your little place, with your plastic grass, your artificial sunlight, all those gadgets that saved you from having to go out. I guess you go out a lot now, huh? Yes. In fact, I'm lucky I found you in. Who do you go out with? It's none of your business. No? You sure? Listen to me, Gene. Go home. It's too soon to talk. Too much pain, anger. It's hard for me too, you know. Sure. It's hard for you because you're so weak. Just a sweet, shy, impressionable... It was me, wasn't it? I suffocated you with my strength, took you over. I corrupted you with my money and my power. You had to ditch me to defend the delicate little flower of your weakness. You can't imagine how much I despise you. I despise weaklings... your passivity, your laziness, your hypocrisy. Go away. Don't worry. I'm going. You know, maybe we can meet again in about a month and talk about all this. I don't think that's very likely. I see you don't wear it around your neck anymore. My house key. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Stop. Please, please. One last time. Don't you want to? - Stop it. No, I don't want to. Well, maybe your head doesn't want to. It's my head that counts. Oh, your head was never your best part, my dear. That's all right. One head in the family is quite enough, don't you think? Stop playing these games. Just so you know, speaking of games, I've invented a new video game. There's a beautiful pearl fisher and a sea monster who wants to imprison her in his tentacles. I have to go. You haven't changed at all, have you? No intention of changing. I'll get your key. Here it is. It's kind of dirty... because I had a rum truffle in my bag and it melted. Gene? Gene! Gene, don't you ever come back here! Transmitters in place. Hunter primed. 15 cubic centimeters of hormone extract injected. Strength, 75%. Increase in aggressivity, 300%. Time limit before hunter dies of auto intoxication, 60 minutes. Time elapsed, six minutes and 30 seconds. Time remaining, 53 minutes and 30 seconds. Hello? Hello? Hello, who's there? Damn it. Hello? Oh, no. Eva. Yes? Calm down. OK. OK, by me. God's ring. Ow. Shit. Don't be absurd. The chances of you picking up an infection, my dear, are about five in 495. Yes, I nearly got gangrene in my finger thanks to his God damn electric chicken slicer. Relax. Breathe deeply. Exhale slowly. Let the tension flow out of your body. Concentrate. Feel your body. The music is inside you. Listen to your pulse, your blood pumping, your life flowing through your veins. Now, adopt the plow position. Slowly. And now count slowly to 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Are you happy? Let your blood flow through you. Think of heaven. Think of fire and water. Oh, water! Oh. Oh, for Pete's sake. When I ask you for the answers, you can not deny I want you here until the rivers run dry and the dream make the heart come alive. Poltergeist 3. Oh, that feels great. Oh, you who look down from on high and judge, Gene Campbell. Yes, I've let the bath run over again. And, frankly, my dear, I don't give a shit. I was never quite up to your level, was I? Never quite the female Android you were so eager to have. That's great. Why didn't I say that when he was here? The arrogant bastard wouldn't have listened. Dear Gene... Oh! Aggressivity of hunter, maximum. Time elapsed, 24 minutes and 25 seconds. Time remaining, 35 minutes and 35 seconds. Dear Gene, it's 7:43, afternoon, Tuesday, April 8. You left a half hour ago having, in this order, insulted me, interrogated me, humiliated me. Finally, you made a half-assed attempt to seduce me, which was interrupted, fortunately, by one of your god damn machines. You know, in all of the time I lived with you I never did anything, never even said anything spontaneous. I was like a kid with too many fingers and never knew where to put them. I guess I've always been a little scared of your superior intelligence. And the truth is you are very clever. And you've always had just what you wanted. And you live in a world where you press a button and all your wishes come true. But that world, your electronic world... In the real world the strong and the weak don't exist. We're all a bit of both. I have my strengths. You have your weaknesses. I've seen you when you play chess with your fellow geniuses. You have to win, don't you? And the second before you checkmate your opponent, you're so tense you look sick. Just the idea that there's the possibility of losing terrifies you. I scare you too, don't I? Everything that's good about me scares you... My happiness, my talent. You're terrified that someone's gonna look at me, touch me. But you're a child. You don't want me. But you want to make sure no one else does. Well, I've got news for you. I'm not going to play in your games anymore. I'm gonna put this cold on your account too. Ugh. You must learn to control yourself, my dear. First, you dry your hair. Then you tell me to fuck off. Oh, shit. OK, let's see where we were. I guess, I'd better cancel. And I'm gonna put this cold on your account too. What the fuck? Why won' t it open? Why won't it open? No! Here we go. This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare. Stop it. Must stay calm. Must stay calm. Maybe it isn't poisonous. May it's just a garden snake. Time remaining, 31 minutes and 45 seconds. It's a mamba. Can't get up here. The Mamba is totally deaf but detects the secretion of adrenaline in the air generated by the fear of its prey. When striking, it raises itself to a height equal to one third of its length. Its venom is deadly. Ah, ah, oh, oh, ah. No! Hello, can you hear me? I can't hear you. My telephone's broken. I know it sounds unbelievable, but it's true. I swear it. I'm shut up in my house with a mamba, and I'm terrified of snakes. I'm terrified. The door is jammed, and I can't get out. I can't even call. There are no windows. If you can hear, it's a loft out in the middle of the sports grounds, 34th Street exit. If you can hear me, get help. Call the police. 34th Street, sports ground. It's a matter of life or death. Why? Why? Oh, Christ. Where is it? Where is it? Oh. My boots. Protect my legs. Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh! Paylo. Help me. Time elapsed, 41 minutes. Time remaining, 19 minutes. Oh. Oh, you're not gonna bite. You're frightened of fire, aren't you? You son of a bitch. Open! Ah! You are afraid! You're afraid. You're afraid too. Now I can taste your adrenaline, you bastard. Hey, isn't that what you wanted? You come and get it, you yellow fucker. Whoever you are, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself! You're putting up quite a fight, dear. Got to keep moving. Get it confused. Got to keep running. Keep running. Faster. Faster! Got you! No. Fuck. I'm in heaven now. I feel you next to me because when you're around I feel the ecstasy. Never let you go. Don't you run... OK, let's see where you are. You coming out? Turn your heart around and pick you off the ground. I'm in... Look at all the lovely things to bite in here. Look, there's Moby Dick. Oh, I guess you don't like him because he doesn't stink of adrenaline, right? He's dead. Not like me. It's my fear you want, right? It's my fear you want, isn't it? It's what I've waited for. Can I try to make it right, making love... Filthy. Filth... I'm in heaven now. You're gonna want to love me. Hear it... Help me, please! The sound. Listen to me! Damn you! Listen! Don't go away! Lick you off the ground. I'm in heaven now. You know you got a say. Every night... Come out! Come out you fucker! Come out! Come out you fucking, fucking bastard! Where are you! Bastard! Come out, you! Where... Come out! Come out! Come out! Auto intoxication almost complete. You did much better than I expected. In fact, you almost won. Another few minutes, the snake would have been dead and you'd have been safe. Of course, there's only a chance in a million. But I do like to give my opponent some chance. And you did very well. If you'd stayed with me, I could've protected you. But you didn't want that. You wanted to be free. Free. Freedom doesn't exist. What do you think freedom is? Being able to live amongst idiots? It means you sell yourself, your way of laughing, everything. Everything is for sale. And little by little you become like all the others, stupid and arrogant. And you learn how to set a price. And I couldn't let that happen to you. You're the only woman, the only thing, the only human being. I have ever loved, Eva. I can't allow you not to belong to me. I had no other way of keeping you. Gene. Hush. One more minute and you won't feel a thing. The game's over. Good bye, Eva. Listen to your heart, listen to a voice you know. And you will see the other side, anywhere you want to go. Turning with the tide, now you're finally coming home. Listen to your heart, listen to a voice you know. Making up the time, watching as a heart beat goes. We are the heroes of a day running down an awful road. Wish I could be there to show how much I care. Listen to your heart, listen to a voice you know. We're in town again to remember when. Hear the words I say in the love of a life. Reach across the miles. Free the lawless child. Every night and day, take every chance in the path of faith. Listen to your heart, listen to a voice you know. We are the hostages of love, tied into a mortal soul. The fire and the flame, the candle burns again. Listen to your heart, listen to a voice you know. Listen to your heart, listen to a voice you know. Listen to your heart, listen to a voice you know.
