Wales body in gone at the room you gentlemen take the feet doctor you and I can just the mom well the test didn't work very well didn't the four of you hesitated certainly you can't all be guilty well we'll have to try something else now I would like to visualize the scene a little more clearly let's form that circle I can't I say us or without mr. Vails won't y'all sit just that you were sitting at the seance well Richard was sitting there Madame la grosse was next to him and I was sitting next to her and there were the oddest planes I'm trying to remember queer what a jumbled memory one has I thought next to you sir Rosco don't you remember we joked about holding my hand who sat next please Yes. Doctor I could place them all for you if you'd be so kind well this young lady was there and this is out next to us and this young lady hath Nick she she was here no that gentleman came. NICs feel you're wrong there huh I was what are you alright I was there I remember saying won't you sit Dyneema silly all right who's up next to dr. Mason wait this young lady something seems wrong here oh no that's what I was sitting next to you as my doctor you must we go through this again I'm afraid so. Lady Crosby who occupied this seat mr. wale I know because I sat here and I was next to him thanks are you all sure that you had the right places mix up here I know I was not next to mr. Wale of course you were I don't know been singing us I was sitting where mrs. Eastwood well yeah and I was next to mr. Spanish and dr. Mason I knew I was in the wrong seat if you ladies will exchange places I want you all to be extremely careful I don't want any surmises did the messages come for anyone but mr. Whale no the cause for all the waves he kept on saying do you know who killed you did she mention a name no she gave a long loan then Edward whales continued to ask he said tell me who killed you I want the name and suddenly gave an agonized scream and cried out that he was hurt he was dead when we turned on the light Natan is here inspector Thanks now one more question sir Rosco did you get the impression that if mr. Vails had not killed his question would have been answered yes it was very stablished in your mind that Wales was the only person able to get a message I'm positive and he was killed in order to prevent his question being answered the impression we got doubtedly that leads to the conclusion that whoever killed. Wales knew which kills pencil II well there's a police matron room who will search the lady's rings other men one at a time it makes no difference to me what order they go well I have nothing to conceal name is ID are they awaited the few minutes Madame Lagarde I'm quite ready son I thank you very much you need not eat that in law unless you wish. Oh Richard madam Lee groans sir the question I wish to ask you anything at all sir for mr. Wales asked you for the name why didn't you answer him I don't know sir I was in a trance then you didn't hear the question how could I I didn't ask you that I asked you why you didn't answer him why didn't you carry out your part of the bargain I don't know what you mean my words are perfect explain why didn't you carry out a part of the bargain you've all say I'm father Frank wasn't only plan but rehearse between you and. Wales he saw that a woman had killed his friend and he told you about it and I'll to help to discover the murderer I don't know what you're talking about at all perhaps this you refresh your memory what do you want answer don't forget the swimming pool don't hit the swimming pool then do you mean the time he went in after me when I was drowning then later Spencer Lee says he can't rest and so on and so on down to do you know who killed you the answer to that would have been yes what did she say she didn't answer that question the next question is can you tell the name and then she was swept hold of woman's name just the first name so Rosco what did she reply to that question she moaned and cried keep on asking keep on asking why didn't you do with your greed I don't know what you're talking about Tom you dog mr. Reyes there he was killed Spence Ali and he was sure that he found that woman but she dared not accuse or even tell me her name but he knew she would be here tonight he thought that he can play your have superstitious fears and that when her name seemingly came from the spirit of the dead man he would confess he told. Madame Lagarde the name you agreed to all this why didn't you speak the name I don't know Alison about okay there must have forgotten to tell it to oh no he didn't so Watson Danny day he doesn't tell me onion urns you came here for that purpose and after you got here something happened to make you change you plan something unexpected happen something unexpected happened now what was mrs.
