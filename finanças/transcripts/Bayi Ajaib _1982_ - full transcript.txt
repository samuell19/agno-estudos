A diamond! A diamond! The whole village will be mine! Thanks to you! Hey, you! Don't you dare try and get your hands on this diamond! Twelve dots. Exactly like footprints. Is this... This isn't it. "Alberto Dominique." This is to secure my position as village chief. Help me in any way possible. When I've achieved everything, I believe the Dominiques family will be rich. This is one way to secure the village chief's seat. Yes, sir. A power like no other. Long live Mr. Kosim! Though the next election is still a while away, I'm eager to take the seat. You mustn't forget that. Starting now, we shall set our plans carefully. Yes. Use this. Everything would have failed without your help. Don't worry, Mr. Kosim's problems are our problems too. Very good. Here. If you become the village chief, we will be happy too. Of course. We will do our best to help you. - However... - Sir! Sir. - Where's Sumi? - Still with the midwife. Madam told me to return home. When I got there, I saw Mr. Saleh persuading the villagers to get their vote for village chief. There's someone else who wants to compete with me? Back there, Mr. Saleh was... A village chief's role is to foster the well-being of the people and improve the village. But this can only be achieved with the cooperation of its community. As a village chief, one must not act selfishly. The public interest must be prioritized. That's right, sir. So the deadbeat is also running for the election. With what money is he competing? Is he going to sell his body? Without money, I believe it's all nonsense. Prioritizing public interest? He's good with words. Don't worry. As long as we have money, we'll win. That's right. But remember, there's a tougher competitor. Who? Dorman Dominique. I know it's hard to believe... but he's determined to win the election. I must win. I must win. I must win. Alberto Dominique. Dorman's ancestor. According to old folks' stories... back in the day, Alberto monopolized the people's crops... with cruel and vicious actions to control this village. Are you afraid of Dorman? What was that? Afraid? No. I knew perfectly well the intention... of Dorman's candidacy this time. What is it? You don't have to know. He'll do anything to win. Perhaps he will not hesitate to commit heinous acts like his ancestor did. May the birth of my baby... encourage me even further. And I will not cower to any obstacles. This is nothing. It's only been six months. But I feel like my baby's doing martial arts inside. That's normal. But remember, you mustn't exhaust yourself. Is this your first child? - Yes, ma'am. - I see. Ma'am. Here's something for you. Are you in a rush? It's almost sunset. I must go home. If I come home late, Kosim will start looking for me. - See you, ma'am. - All right. Please take care. Yes, ma'am. Sir. The midwife said, madam left for home on her own at sunset. Sunset? Yes, sir. Miss Sumi! Sumi! Miss Sumi! Sumi! Where? - Ask the people living here. - Okay, sir. Sumi! Mr. Kosim. Don't lose hope. I'm sure your wife will come back. Go home for now. Sumi? Sumi? What happened? Your stomach is flat! A miscarriage? How is the baby in your back? Sumi! Ma'am! Please help my wife! Help! Sumi! Sumi! Sir, sir! Here, sir. Sumi. Sumi. Ma'am. She's bleeding. How is she, ma'am? It's strange. The fetus moved to her back. I've never seen anything like this. It's almost like a bad omen. I don't care how... but please, help my wife and deliver our first child safely. It hurts! Stay still, Sumi. It hurts, ma'am! Ouch, ma'am! It hurts! It hurts! My child. It's the eclipse! The eclipse! The eclipse is here! Your child... The eclipse! The eclipse! Imah, bring the baby to safety! The face will be scarred, like the moon consumed by the eclipse. But the baby is still inside the membrane. Just secure it quickly! I'll take care of Sumi. Yes, ma'am. Help! Help! Imah! Imah! Imah! Imah. Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un. What a strange thing to occur. How horrifying! Yeah. Where's my child? It's blood. My child. My son. Long live Didi! Long live Didi! Long live Didi! How strange. Something doesn't feel right. Long live Didi! Long live Sultan! Long live Sultan! Stop! Go! Huh? Why isn't it cutting? So tough. It's not working. It won't cut. Dear. The knife isn't sharp enough? I should try it. It's sharp! It's chipped? How could it be chipped? How could it be chipped? How did it happen? This one is good. It should work now. Here we go. The first time something like this happened. How is this possible? Hey, what gives? Are we doing it or not? What's going on now? My God. - He's mad. - Didi. He's upset. We can't continue. Hold him. It won't hurt. - What's wrong, Di? - Honey. Didi. Didi! Didi! Didi! Huh? Ouch! For the glory of the Dominique family. Di, look. I can throw it far. I bet you can't. Yeah, you're bigger. Let's do a peeing competition. What? Peeing competition? Yup. The longest one to pee wins. What's the stake? The loser gives a piggyback ride. Don't get cocky. Your snot's dripping. - Strong enough to carry me? - Sure. Wait here. Don't run away. Hey! Don't drink without asking! Don't you have manners? Shame on you! - Let's do it. - Okay. I won! Give me a piggyback ride! Hey! Don't pee on me! Huh? Are you wearing a tube? Uncircumcised brat. How dare you play tricks? Cheater! Hey, cheater! Stop right there! Uncircumcised brat! Stop! Stop running! Come here, you cheater! Son of a gun! Horse! Horse! Horse! Horse! Chase him! Chase him! Hey! Hey, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Watch out! Step aside! Watch out! - Ouch! - Watch out! Watch out! Didi, if you misbehave again, you can't return home. He's just a kid. All kids are naughty at least once. That's true, kids are naughty. But when I'm scolding him, don't justify his behavior in front of him. You were also notorious as a naughty child. Sumi. Go to bed. Now. Didi, let's go to bed, dear. Honey. As long as our child is uncircumcised, he is always teased by his peers. I guess so. I agree. But do you remember, the knife chipped during the circumcision? Weird. Dear. It's Friday tomorrow. Take Didi to the mosque so that his soul can be trained. We'll pray in the mosque. Come on. Are you sick? Come on. Come on. Don't be naughty. Didi! Come on! What's the matter with you? Come on. Didi! Don't chase him. Your son is possessed. Don't you sense any anomalies? What? Who are you? No need to ask. When your son was getting circumcised, I had a hunch. Remember. Your son will bring calamity. It will constantly terrorize your soul. For the benefit of others. Impossible. You're speaking nonsense. Wait! You must know that by revealing this secret, my soul is now also under threat. I don't believe it. Don't try to scare me. That is up to you. But I sensed that your wife is pregnant. What? My wife is pregnant? Whether my wife is pregnant or not, even I wouldn't know that. How would you know? Be careful what you say. Let me tell you once again. Your son won't let his younger sibling be born safely. You lunatic. Stay out of my family matters. Remember, one day you'll believe my premonition. Didi was very strange. When he's upset, he doesn't consider me as his father. It's all right, honey. Don't lose your temper. Didi is just a kid. I know he's a kid, but his behavior is outrageous. Have patience, honey. He's our only child. I know. Want another one? I can give you two. Twins, if you want. Geez. I'm having one right now. Here. - You're pregnant? - Yeah. That psychic is amazing. Saleh is nothing to me. Not a tough opponent in the election. Anyone who dares to take that spot from me... will become like this. What should we do next, sir? Give away the goodies to the villagers so that I can get their support. In fact, I'm ready to offer up my land, my rice fields, all my possessions, to achieve my goal. Yes, sir. We'll distribute the goodies tomorrow. And then the people will remember your kindness. Please don't worry. You'll win. Here you go. It's from Mr. Kosim. - Here you go, ma'am. - Thank you. Sir, for your family. - Everyone will get one. - Quickly! - For you, ma'am. - Thanks. - Remember, it's from Mr. Kosim. - Thanks. One for you, sir. Sir! One for you too! Catch! For you, ma'am. I'm sure if Mr. Dorman becomes the village chief, our rice fields will not be short of water. Not only that, I heard Mr. Dorman will make our lives better. We'll find out in two days. Who's going to be the village chief. Now, shall we make a bet? I'm sure it's Dorman. No. I'll bet on Kosim. Don't forget about Mr. Saleh. He's small fry. Wanna bet on what? You name it. House? Buffalo? Or Miss Tini. You're nuts. Settle down, everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, it so happens that in our village, the village chief election will be held. Our group is here to entertain and make Mr. Kosim's candidacy a success. Show its might. Why don't I have a reflection? Help! Honey! What's wrong? What happened? I saw a ghost! It's just in your head. There is nothing. Let's go inside. Didi! You're so naughty. I hope your younger siblings won't be like you. How nice. There's a reflection over here. Very nice. Didi! Didi! Didi! Didi! Are you okay, Son? Didi, stay still. I will help you up. Come on. Be careful. Hold my hand. Careful. Come on, hold my hand. Just a little more. Quickly. Come on. Help! Kosim! - Sumi? - Help! Sumi! Help! Didi! What happened? Let's get you up. Honey! - Honey! - Sumi! - Help! - Sumi, step on the stones to get up! It was only six months pregnancy when Didi was born. And so far, I see that his behavior is abnormal. I had a hunch. Could your wife's conception be corrupted by evil spirits? Before Didi was born, the fetus moved to Sumi's back. And after he was born, many misfortunes occurred. Perhaps. It's possible. Especially after what happened earlier. Could Didi be... My son. Your son won't let his younger sibling be born safely. From these occurrences... your hunch is exactly like the psychic said. And now, everything is clear. Based on word of mouth, there used to be a Portuguese family that ruled this village. He did whatever he wanted. He was cruel. Forgive me! Please! Please have mercy! Please! Cover him. His actions angered the villagers. And eventually, he was hanged. My spirit will seek revenge even to the end of the world. Go! The body of the Portuguese man was buried somewhere in this village. Because it was a long time ago, the signs of the grave are gone. Could it be, that grave is Dorman Dominique's ancestor grave? What? Dominique? Yes. When Didi went missing after birth, I found him at an old fort. Perhaps that's the grave. Excuse me, ma'am. Mr. Kosim. You guys. Everyone has gathered. The election will begin soon. Yes, sir. You are expected. You must hurry and show up. I... Why aren't you excited? That's not my priority right now. My head is a mess. I'm dealing with something urgent. So what's the point of our efforts? You've sacrificed so much of your wealth. Don't lose hope. We may not necessarily lose the election. You must think about your supporters. That's right, sir. They'll be disappointed. Dorman, 258 votes. Based on the voting results, the new village chief is Mr. Saleh. Long live Mr. Saleh! Long live Mr. Saleh! Thank you. - Hurray! Mr. Saleh! - Mr. Saleh! Long live Mr. Saleh! Curse you! You're not helping my plan! Useless! Worshiping you every day was meaningless! Useless! Curse you! Curse you! How unlucky. Yeah. Our plans were ruined. Maybe it's for the best. I no longer want the seat. But why? I almost lost my mind. Thanks to the strange events that have been happening to my family. What now? Thank you for believing in me and supporting me. You have elected me to lead this village. I sincerely ask for your help in assisting the improvement of our village. - Yes, sir. - It's what we were hoping for. Keep in mind that, no matter what, buying people's vote for personal gain is not allowed by religious principles. All mining resources underground belong to the government. It is not a property to be hoarded to grow personal wealth. That's right! Who was elected? Never mind that. Let's not talk about it. Where's Didi? Isn't he in his room? No. What's wrong, honey? It's strange. He's not home at this late hour. Kosim. You're raising Didi just like you're raising a tiger cub. He always brings misfortune to your family. When your son was born, and since your candidacy as the village chief. Don't you feel that you're followed by calamity? How can you say that? Think it through. If Didi were a normal child, how is it possible for a child to drag an adult and make her fall? And into a well? Clearly your son is under the influence of an evil spirit. I'm certain it's the spirit of the Portuguese man. He's controlling your son's soul. I suggest you ask for help from the village's elders. Yes, ma'am. I'll try. The sooner the better. Otherwise, it's you who will be doomed. I'm going home. Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What do you think, honey? Don't worry. I'll go see the village elders tomorrow. Help! Help! Please! Ouch! Help! Help! Anybody, help! Let go! Didi! Hey! Are you out of you mind? Let her go! Let go! Don't! Stop it. Why not? Your son is innocent. These incidents are all because of the evil spirit. Didi? Calm down. Your son is okay. Dad. There's your father. Do I still have it? Looks good. Now, we're going to try this knife. Ouch. Now it's cut. It doesn't hurt, right? Here's some ointment. So it won't sting. I thought it would chip again. I'll put on some bandages. THE END
