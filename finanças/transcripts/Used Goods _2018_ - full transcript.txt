You must get this done for me today. It cannot wait any longer. -Sweetheart. -Where are you, Mustafa? How could you leave me alone for two nights while you sleep in the lab? Are you still mad at me? No, I can't be mad at you. I miss you so much, baby. -Tell me, what do you wanna eat? -You know I would eat anything you made. -I'll leave in 15 minutes. -Okay. I'll prepare dinner in the meantime. I miss you. I love you. Mustafa! All of this for me? I love you so much! -I adore you. -Liar! -Is it that obvious? -Yeah. But even if you were lying, I'd keep loving you, and I won't let you rest until you're the most successful man in the world. -Just don't change your mind after a year. -I'll think about it. -I hold you in higher esteem every day. -Why? The way you kiss my hand tells me you're a lady. Didn't you know I'm a lady already? -Not just any lady, a real lady. -Your words mean a lot to me, Mustafa. No words could express what you mean to me. -I love you. -I love you so much. Mustafa. -Yes, my sweetheart. -Mustafa. -I'm very happy. -You can't be happier than me. -Why? -Why? I'm with the prettiest and kindest lady there is. -Is that all? -No, of course not. I have many things to say, but do you have the time? I don't have the time. I'm a man who prefers to act, not talk. Right? -Right. -I have a question. Please answer frankly. What? -Will you answer frankly? -Ask. Why do I love you so much? -I don't know. -You don't know? Mustafa, I need 2,000 Egyptian pounds. -At the beginning of next month, my love. -Next month? Next month never seems to come for you. Frankly, I'm fed up. You're wasting your salary on your papers and journals you read all night. Other people in your position are off in their Mercedes or their nice villas. Why don't you pay attention to that, doctor? I've just started to pay attention, doctor. Mustafa. I'm sorry. Don't worry, Serine. I love you so much, Mustafa. -I adore you. -I'm really sorry, I didn't mean-- Don't be sorry. I said I adore you. -Very much? -Very much. What am I to you? The cure for everything. You make up for everything I lack, Serine. You could say that you're a spoonful of sugar in a bitter drink. Just one spoonful? -You are so greedy! -So greedy? Am I greedy, my dear? Come on. Go to work. Take care of yourself and drive slowly. Okay. I love you. The check will arrive on time, as agreed. Your stubbornness will cost you everything. If you don't stand with them, then you stand against them. Won't you say where the research is, doctor? If I don't stand with them, I'll be true to who I am. They'll get the research for pennies, and sell it back for millions. The poor will lament. Do you have nothing else to say? You'll lose everything! Those who came before you were gotten rid of for a low price. They'll get rid of you for an even lower price. Believe me, the price might be low, but no lower than the situation we're in. Dr. Mustafa Alsebeeli... may he rest in peace. Knife sharpening! Scissor sharpening! Come on, girl. Let's bring in the clothes from the washing line. You're so beautiful! I don't know how much longer you'll be able to refuse all your suitors. -Until someone with money proposes, sis. -The only guys with money we see are in movies. The best suitor in this dodgy neighborhood -is probably a sewer worker. -This is the knife, Miss Hayam. Thank you, Mr. Metwally. -Take the money from my father. -Okay. Dad, come and eat. What are you doing? Leave it. Let's eat. I'm fixing this stove for your aunt, Um Gamalat, down the road. Buying new is too expensive for her. When she comes to take it this afternoon, -don't take the remaining money from her. -We never ask for anything in return. -God help her with her son. -God bless you, Heema. Oh, my... Dad, what would you have done if my name was Nazineeh? My name is Hayam. It's endearing enough. Yet you feel the need to nickname me Heema? What's wrong with that? You're my first daughter, and I'm indulging you. You said it. "Daughter." It's not my fault God didn't give you a boy. Good. Stop here, Shampoo. Good, young donkey. Where were you? -I was taking her to the dump. -Watch your words! Do you always have to talk like a thoughtless ass? What's wrong with what he said? He really took me to the dump! -God! -He's a garbage man, not a bank manager! Take this drink, courtesy of Talima, and forget your worries, Uncle Rida. Thank you very much, Talima. Come on. It's still early in the morning. Take this girl with you. Go to Master Naser, the olive-seller, and bring the goods we agreed on. -How come you can't stop laughing? -I'm just happy, man. God. Yes! Whoa, Shampoo! Stop. What's this? Oh, my God! There's a corpse! -A corpse? -Oh, my God! Oh, my God! He seems to still be alive. Let's carry him to a hospital. We don't want any more trouble! I'm getting married soon! Do you have no spine? Do you have no soul? Be a bit more empathetic! Come on, Lubna, help carry him with us. Lift him. Other people in your position are off in their Mercedes or their nice villas. Your stubbornness will cost you everything. They'll get the research for pennies, and sell it back for millions. The poor will lament. You're stupid. You'll waste your life. Sometimes, stupidity is a blessing. Those who came before you were gotten rid of for a low price. They'll get rid of you for an even lower price. This is what we retrieved from Mustafa Alsebeeli. His wallet contains his papers, but nothing relating to his research. Okay. This is your share. -This isn't what we agreed on, Mr. Fouad. -Don't get too greedy, Hassan. I'll make it up to you. This won't be our last time working together. Why have we been taken into custody? What's wrong? Is this what we get for doing a good deed? You think we've been arrested because they're happy with us? I told you that you'd get us in trouble! -Are you happy now? -Stop it! I've shredded enough statements. Sir, can't you let the women go and just leave me handcuffed to this fool? No, I can't! The important thing is if that blood-drenched man we brought in is still alive, or has he died? I'm so worried. Mustafa's disappearance isn't normal at all. Surely... -Surely, something has happened to him. -I'm going nuts, Father! Where has he gone? Why has his phone been off all this time? We must inform the police. He suffered a head injury. Though the wound isn't very big, it's deep. It has caused a loss of memory. This is in addition to the burns on his face. It's a miracle from God that he survived. The bullet went very close to his heart. Tell me, are these the people who attacked you? I can't remember anything. I don't even remember my name. Write this down. I, Amjad Raghmarawy, Deputy Attorney General, order... the release of those accused... to be summoned again if needed, upon submitting proof of residence, because of lack of evidence. This issue is resolved at this time and date... until more information is obtained. Wait a minute. I just need you for a minute. -Come on! What's taking so long? -Come on, my daughter. Okay, Dad. One moment, sir. -Quickly. -Take this money with you. The man in there is poor and alone. If he needs some juice, or anything, get it for him. -And buy him half a chicken to eat. -As you wish. -Why can't you spend on your own sister? -I'll buy you a sandwich! Be patient! Did you hear me? If anything happens, please call. Write my number down. What did you find out, Dad? -They don't know anything about him. -So where did he go? We've been searching for two weeks. We've checked every hospital and police station. There's not even any trace of his car. Please Dad! Do something. Get Mustafa back for me, please! There is no power but that in God. Here's a pound, Um Farooq. I'll have one more turn. Just one pound, you swindler? You've had so many turns already! Open up your heart! When it comes to money, my heart is as black as dirt. Haji, why don't you come and have a swing? Isn't it enough that life is swinging me left and right? -You want to swing me about, too? -As you wish. Hello. The guy you brought in was discharged, but no one came to collect him. What's this? What brings him outside, Dad? Who discharged you, my son? They discharged me. Don't you remember any of your friends, relatives, or even acquaintances? -I don't remember anything. -Tell me, have you eaten anything? Have you thought about what you'll do, or where you'll go? -What do we do? Leave him like this? -It's God's will, my daughter. Let's take him with us. He can make money by doings errands. God will reward us. I'm worried he'll bring us trouble and make us suffer. -We've had enough trouble. -Uncle Rida, don't be afraid. As long as I'm with you, I won't allow you to let fear into your heart. But I assure you that he's trouble. Go away, then, if he's such trouble. You're boring us. Think logically! When we found him, he'd been shot and left for dead by the canal with the rest of the garbage. What do you think he is? A merman? That's the first logical thing you've said so far. Let's give him shelter until his family turns up. God will reward us, Dad. We don't earn much money, so let's earn rewards in the afterlife. Listen, Uncle Rida, I won't allow my girls to be exposed to such a strange man. He won't be allowed in our house. -That's my man! -My duck! Where will he stay, then? Do you want us to book him in at the Marriott Mena House? Or do you want him out on the street with the stray dogs? I'll prepare the chicken coop for him! He can look after the goods! The chicken coop? He's not a chicken! He can sleep at my place. We can sweep the coop and cluck together! -Who's that? -He's Salah El-Shemal. He's a robabeekya trader. He drove the government nuts, and doing so drove him nuts. He then got fed up and came here. There is goodness here in abundance. Good fortune hangs in the air. -Are you looking to set up business here? -What's wrong with that, Mr. Ayman? -Did the enemies of success send you here? -I'm glad you know of me. You're famous around these parts, like a star in the-- Be polite, and I'll treat you with respect. Be impolite, and I'll treat you with contempt. We've forgotten about the past, sir. We want to turn a new page, with love. We want to honestly earn our living. We don't want to fight anymore. God says, "And remind them, for indeed, the reminder benefits the believers." Praise be, you seem to be an officer from the Ministry of Religion! For being so sarcastic, I've renewed your probation for two months. -See you later, Shemal. -Later, Sir. May safety and peace be always on your side. Welcome, my countryman. Is this any good, my Uncle Rida? -Answer him, "my Uncle Rida"! -"My Uncle" sounds funny, coming from you! Stop babbling! Listen, it's just "Uncle Rida." Don't say "my Uncle Rida." You can call me Uncle Rida. What do I call you? I'll tell you, Dad. I know what we can name him. We'll name him after the beloved Hamaqi! -Then, give it a rest, will ya? -What do you think about the name Ahmed? -It's a very common name, Uncle Rida. -Let's call him "the Foreigner." Isn't that a bit much? I've always dreamt of having a son to name after my dad. -What do you think of Othman? -I wish God had given you a son. Let's call him Barakat so that his future life is full of goodness. Othman is way better. -"The Foreigner" is best! -I haven't come to cause an argument. Name me Barakat, address me as the Foreigner, and as a nickname... okay, you can call me Othman. Mustafa! Where have you been? I've been looking for you everywhere. I've missed you a lot. I haven't had anything to eat or drink in a month. Calm down, Serine. Calm down, my love. Calm down. -I'll explain everything. -How could you do this to me? -Am I not your spoonful of sugar? -You're all the sugar in the world. Am I not a lady like no other? -You're the lady of all ladies. -Why did you disappear so suddenly? Why did you do this to me? Dad, I'm seeing Mustafa everywhere. I'll go nuts if you don't bring him back. Calm down, my darling. Enough. -Barakat, my son! -Uncle Rida. What? You're still awake? I thought you were a heavy sleeper. -My worries are heavier on me than sleep. -Teach your worries how to walk so they won't cling to your neck and tire you out. Ah, where is it? My knees hurt. I have arthritis. I also suffer from horrible gout. -Right here, my cartilage tissue is torn. -I'll massage it. What do you take, Uncle Rida? Two doses of Aspirin to soothe the pain. I want to ask something of you, Barakat. Trust in God, my son. And you'll find your way back to your family, safe and sound. I have to know who I am first. Listen to Uncle Rida's words and you'll be a winner. As the saying goes, if someone is one day older than you, what does that make them? -Someone born the day before me? -It makes them a year wiser, dumbass. -Get up. Let's pray the morning prayer. -Uncle Rida... can't you find me some smaller underwear? I'm lost in yours. After prayers. Look, Barakat, my son. From now on, I don't want you to be shy at all. If you need anything, ask for it. I'll answer immediately. Uncle Rida, I need underwear in my size. Yours are very big. I'm lost in them. Nice one! That was intentional! I wanted to do that to you. Ask me why. -Why? -I want you to be tougher. I want to make a real man out of you. So, I won't be a real man till I get a rash? So funny! Look, I want to tell you something, Barakat. Would it be appropriate for you to wear a coat and scarf, and things like that, in the summer? -No. -Okay. Would it be appropriate for you to walk around without any clothes on in the winter? -No. -That's why I gave you those underwear! So that, since you're living among us, you'd be dressed appropriately, like one of us! So, do you all suffer from rashes? That's so funny! And why did I hit you? So that part of your face will become stronger, and you'll be able to carry things with it. Come on. Follow me. -Where are you going, sir? -"Sir"? You're really gonna call me that? They don't call people like me "sir." In a neighborhood like this, a person like me is called "master," "haji," or "headman." What do you want to buy, "haji, master, or headman"? I'll get some cress. -Looks like you read a lot of poetry. -That's so funny! -Talima! -Yes, Master Salah? Bring me a cup of tea with sugar. -Our best cup of tea, just for you. -Go away. Why is it so sweet? What's wrong, Barakat? Your father was bothering me at the market, Heema. My name is Hayam! Oh, my God. I'm very sorry, Barakat. Please don't be upset. I didn't mean it. It's okay, Hayam. Why would I be upset? It's nothing compared to what I've been through. Take it easy, Barakat. Anyone who goes through what you've been through should be treated like a young child. You're getting to know the world anew. It's my destiny to start my life again from the beginning. Look, Barakat, you've got to gain more experience with this world. You shouldn't be too naive or too rough around the edges. You have to speak properly. This is very important. If you go to the market to buy some bread, what do you say? "Please give me five loaves of bread as pretty as you." If you want to buy tomatoes... Give me five tomatoes as pretty as you. Listen and learn. You'll say, "I want to buy a kilo of tomatoes." A kilo of tomatoes as pretty as you. -That's it! Trust in God. -Barakat, get me everything on this list from the apothecary on the corner. You can have five pounds for yourself. I'm cooking for the kids and I don't have time to go myself. -Should I take it, Hayam? -Yes, it's a gift from God. -Take it and put it in your pocket. -Okay, Lubna. -Okay. -Come with me. -Let's go. -I'll buy it for her. No, you're making a big deal out of this. How come? Is there a man in the whole world who would get married to someone without a proper sofa? You're right! I'm mistaken! When your minister uncle or your ambassador father come to visit us, they'll sit on our sofa! Ain't no-one knows or likes you except for me anyway! It's something for the future, girl! Fine, have it your way! We'll get married without a sofa! Suppose a suitor came to propose to our daughter. Where would he sit? In the basement or the dump? You're driving me nuts! We haven't even married yet, and you're talking about my daughter's marriage! Why are you doing this to me? I have a heart problem! Seham! -Seham! -You fool! You can't shout for a woman by name in a place like this! What do I call her then? Isn't her name Seham? Call her by her husband's name, or by Farooq, her son's name. -Farooq! -That's right. -Farooq! -What do you want? -They have no maxi pads at the apothecary. -Be quiet! You're embarrassing me! -Give me the 20 pounds back. -I bought a rash cream with them! -Uncle Rida's underwear are too big on me. -Damn you! Screw you and Uncle Rida's underwear! Stop it, Farooq! I'll pay the 20 pounds! I'll give them to you! Barakat, come upstairs and take out the trash. I will. -May God keep us modest. -Come in. Whoa! You look so beefy! -Where's the trash? -Inside. Why are you in such a hurry, anyway? -Uncle Rida is waiting for me. -Why? Is he the head of the local police? Come in. Beefy! So beefy. Why don't you play on the swing? It's nice and comfortable. Uncle Rida's underwear is too big. It might fall down. Let it! We can lift it back up. Anyway, all that falls is cool. -Even the cool still follow rules. -And what about me? May God keep us modest! I saw an ant committing a sin Her friends were drinking wine Drunk I saw an ant committing a sin -Her friends were drinking wine -You! Singing boy! -I saw an ant committing a sin -Is he deaf or what? -Her friends were drinking wine -You, singing boy! -Drunk -What's wrong? I'm calling you. -Why aren't you answering? -Uncle Rida told me not to answer you. -Why is that? -I asked him the same question. He said, "Avoid all evil, and sing to ward it off." See how I'm singing? I saw an ant committing a sin -Her friends were drinking wine, drunk -He seems to be crazy. Take this. Go get me a pack of cigarettes from the kiosk quickly. Barakat doesn't buy things for anyone. If you have legs, you'll get everything you need yourself. What's all this compassion? -Is he your nephew, or what? -Get your hands off him. -If you touch him again, I'll cut you. -Cut me, please! Spill my blood! You have blood to spill? I had no idea. Barakat, Uncle Rida needs you. I saw an ant committing a sin Her friends... Are you still singing about that ant? What's the story behind this guy and you? I'm telling you, compose yourself and stay on safe ground for your own sake. If I'm happily splashing in the sea, why stand on safe ground? Let's all get flotation aids and splash in the water! A sweet person is sweet in all qualities Except his excessive fondness That doesn't please me They said he might abandon me I said that's okay, as long as he survives The sweet person Here you are, Dad. I like sitting with you, my children. -How are your legs, Uncle Rida? -Fine, thank God, just a little inflamed, since I've been eating broad beans. I feel needles in my heels all the time. There is some pain in both legs. Get well soon, haji. God protect you. If I had a son of my own, he wouldn't do what you're doing for me. May you have no troubles, Dad. May they befall your enemies instead. I hope for those who hate you to suffer, and I hope your legs heal. -I hope you remain healthy, Dad. -Oh, my God! You show such compassion! What is it you want, sweetheart? Actually, Dad, I do have a small favor to ask. -Hamdi and I want to get married. -Yes, please, Uncle Rida! -You want to get married without a sofa? -If I have to wait for a sofa, I'll never be married! -Do you want me to become a maid? -Don't say that! All this fuss over a sofa? Get married, and when you have the money, buy one. Once married, I'll have too many other things to pay for, like feeding her. What's your opinion, Barakat? -May I speak frankly, Uncle Rida? -Is there anything better than frankness? Afaf doesn't need a groom. She needs a personal trainer. Shame on you. She's very pretty. -Very pretty, yeah, like an elephant. -Cool, Barakat. -A biting elephant! -Hamdi's mom must've prayed well for him. But Hayam... she's thin as a rake. -Shame on you! Hayam is like your sister. -Okay, haji. Barakat, if you get married, will you let your wife work? Of course. Do you want us both to be unemployed? -What a bad situation. -I don't know why you're laughing. Go get me some coal for the hookah. That's enough, headman. The coal is rubbing off on you. What are we doing here? Be considerate! Don't scare me like that! Well, I guess there's no chance of me having any more children anyway. It's not wrong for me to ask why we're here! We've come to buy a donkey for the cart parked at the dump so that you and Heema will be able to earn a living. Oh, I get it now. You want me to work to feed myself, yet call me "my sweetheart," "my son whom I didn't father", "make me a fire." Liar. You mustn't say such a thing to one of your elders, like me! It's a terrible thing to say, understand? -Liar! -I told you not to say it! Listen. -Come here. -You're so dull. Come here! Come on, give it to me for 5,000. You better watch your tone, pal! I ain't selling to you. Now, get lost. -Everyone seems really tired. -Yeah. -Good evening, sir. -Hello. I'm sorry to bother you, but I can't find anything that would be suitable to us. Our job requires a sturdy donkey that can move well. This is what we have. Leave it to me, haji. -Tell you what, sir... -Tell me. We need a donkey as pretty as you. -As pretty as me? -As you. Where did you learn to be such time-wasters? A morning as sweet as caramel and almonds. If someone saw a beautiful girl in the street and wanted to press "like", where does he press? I hope you get pressed by a truck whose driver is deaf and blind. I wouldn't mind, if you willed it! It's upsetting to see such beautiful hands forced to wash a dirty cart. Give me the word, and I'll send one of my boys to wash it for you! Keep him. He can wipe your ass. Let's exchange numbers. We can call each other and chat on WhatsApp. Using up my broadband package on you won't be a loss. Have you lost it, or what? I've lost it, and I'm going to search for it. Come with me! Were you sent here to drive me mad? I told you not to speak to anyone unless I told you to! -Okay, Juha. -"Juha"? Shemal came on to Hayam and she shut him down. He kept going, though. That fool must be punished! -What does Juha say? -What's more to say? I agree. Help me down. I want to see how this will end. Leave that donkey, boy. What's wrong, Uncle Rida? Why come to me in such anger? I don't care what your name means, Mr. Dodgy. God guides people. However, what does this Dodgy guy have to do with my girl? I didn't go near her. I was remotely ex-pressing a "like". God says, "If there comes to you a disobedient one -with information, investigate." -Listen to my words. If you live among us and treat us with respect, I'll respect you. -Nice. -If you treat us with disrespect, I'll pull out your eyes! You know, you're a scumbag old man and I ain't gonna hit you 'cause just my intention is enough to hurt you. Get off him! Didn't your family ever show you discipline? They didn't have time. They were diving in Maryotiah. Well, I don't have a family. -Where are they? -In Mansoriah. Those who came before you were gotten rid of for a low price. You'll be gotten rid of for an even lower price. Calm down. Where are you, Mustafa? Wake up, my son. -Wake up, my dear. -Where am I? This is all my fault. Come here. I have kept my heart locked away all this time. The only time it pulsed was when it pulsed for you. You might have to leave at any moment. What have I gotten myself into? I wasn't wrong, Barakat. Of course not, Uncle Rida. Even if you were wrong to approach him, he shouldn't have threatened to beat you. I wasn't talking about that. I mean, I wasn't wrong when I brought you to live with us. None of my actual relatives would have done what you did today. You seem to come from a respectful family. You have good manners. Uncle Rida... I swear... since I've lived among you... I've felt like you're my family. Like you're my father. But do you really insist on using that cart? -Let me just make a fire for you. -A fire? Show me. Hit me, make it quick. No, after what you've done today, I could never hit you. A contrary person. Come closer. Do you know that Seham tried to corner me? -She cornered you? -She tried to. Take it from your sister Lubna. Fight fire with fire, and you'll put out the fire! No, you should never fight fire with fire! We're understanding people! We must be considerate. Right, Uncle Juha? This damn television and all its drama has eaten away at your minds. Get up, girl. Go get the food. I'm busy feeding him, Dad! We're getting married! If I don't nurture him, -he won't keep his strength. -What strength? Heema! Come and eat, my daughter. The food will soon be gone. Why can't you be still? You're making me dizzy. I don't know, Uncle Rida. My father probably did this for a living. I don't know. In the name of Allah. Why didn't you toast the bread, Hayam? Like you care if it's toasted or not. You hoovered everything up anyway. -Do you like the ballet, Barakat? -What? Why? DR. MUSTAFA ALSEBEELI STRANGELY DISAPPEARS A REWARD FOR WHOEVER FINDS HIM Why aren't you eating, Hayam? I'm just about to. From tomorrow, you'll go out on the new cart with Barakat to earn a living. Okay, Dad. How contrary! -What are you saying? -I said, "Ballet." -So, I'm training now? -To get fit. -Take it. -You don't say that. -You say, "Here you go, good fellow." -Here you go, good fellow! Thank you. Give it here. When you ask for it back, you say, "Are you gonna marry that joint or what?" -"Are you gonna marry that joint or what?" -Or what? -I'm training well this way. Right? -Amazing. You're up to the job. -Release the detainee. -What detainee? -I mean, the detainee inside you. -Does that mean he has no family? They left him. They were a drag. He's an orphan like me, then! What's this? The fan has stopped working. Has the light also gone out? I don't know. Hamdi.... Detainee. MUSTAFA ALSEBEELI'S WIFE IS CALLED BEFORE THE DEPUTY GENERAL Damn you and the detainee, Hamdi. Why are you sitting alone? No reason. I'm just getting some fresh air. Air? There's a nice breeze today. A breeze coming this way, from where Hamdi is. Thank you, Talima. -Take care. -Don't worry about me. You take care. Good morning. May God grant you good earnings. -Do you say that from your heart, Rida? -Of course, my whole heart. -Go on! -Beekya. -Junk to be bought! -Junk to be sold! -To be sold or bought? -Don't say either. -Where are you, Jihan? -I'm here, Salamah! -Jihan! -Do you want people to laugh at us? -Where are you, Jihan? -Where are you, Salamah? -Jihan! -You, junk trader! Come around back. -Burn in hell! -Let's go, quickly. Oh, my God, Juha! -I should've stuck with the fire. -Stop it, lady! -Give me orders. I'm at your service. -Pick up that dog. -He really is a dog! -I'll give you a plastic bowl for him. He doesn't even deserve that! All women are like this! They take us in full-figured, and throw us out all bones. -We need a guerrilla resistance! -Or Ali and Hussein! -What? -Have a donut! See this? I got it for 150 pounds. Even this didn't work on him. See this? It says, "Come hither, my love!" -Did he come to you? -I wish! He went out the door! See this? It says, "Stand up straight when you talk to me!" -Did he stand? -I wish! He just fell asleep and snored! Didn't I kiss you yesterday? An air kiss! Wow! He does it over Wi-Fi? He wouldn't pay the internet bill, so the Wi-Fi's out. He can go to hell, then! Move it! You're as heavy as a mountain. -Did this work on him? -No. -This? -No. -This? -I bought it for him on Valentine's Day. Can I have it? I asked Uncle Juha to get me one, and he didn't. A good morning full of caramel, almonds, honey and walnuts, to Uncle Rida, the bravest man in the neighborhood. -Good morning, Uncle Rida. -Hello. Just "hello", Uncle Rida? -That's not a hearty greeting. -That's right. I feel like you're still mad at me. The past is the past! We're neighbors! Neighbors have to get along. I have an interest in your family. I want to ask for Heema's hand in marriage. None of my girls are available for marriage, okay? The prophet says, "If you're satisfied by a man's faith, accept his proposal." I live as God wills, my reputation precedes me, and I'm financially stable. Sharia says you must ask the bride's opinion. I did, and she refused. -Uncle Rida, marriage ensures chastity. -There is no power but of God. God says, "Hating something doesn't mean it isn't good." How can something be good when you're involved? Go away! -Go away! -Okay, I'll go away. As you wish. What brings you here? Oh, God, is this all I'm destined to be? -Did you say something, Barakat? -No, I'm just talking to God. Talking to God is a blessing after all. I feel like I know those people, Hayam. Who do you know? You must be imagining things. I don't know. Tell me, why did you want to see me? I can't stay with her. -Try, for the sake of your relationship. -I can't. -Just try. -Believe me, I can't! You can't stay with me. I'm a guest here myself. -Okay. -Goodbye. Goodbye. When will the day come when you leave us and go, Dr. Mustafa? What's the matter, Hayam? I need you. Come outside. What's up, Hayam? I'm making pies in memory of my mom. -God rest her soul. Need any help? -Not right now, thank you. Just help me carry the trays to the oven, if you don't mind. -As you wish. -Thank you. -May Mom rest in peace. -Amen. My Mom was worth a hundred men. She was very brave. I learned my bravery from her. I learned about mercy from her. It was impossible for my mom to see someone in need and not help them. Her cooking... the whole neighborhood would come to taste it. But she was taken too soon from me. Rest in peace, Mom. It's okay. May she rest in peace. Your words are sweet, Hayam. Even your name. A name that soars in heaven. Not a name like "Riham", or "Hisham". Honestly, I love your name. It's delicate and smooth. It's as if you're in a dream. Thank you, Barakat. God bless you. Look. I want you to write your name on here so we can keep track of it. HAYAM BARAKAT -Have you thought about it? -I want to go ahead with it. Do you want to tell me that living on the street would be better than living with Shorooq? Yes. You can't even imagine what she was doing to me. There is no power but of God. Do you need anything from me? You could use less salt. I am forced to do that so you won't stink. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Beekya! -Junk! -Beekya. Mister! Come, Mustafa. Come, Adam. I don't know what to tell you. I didn't call you because I have something to sell you, as you can see. I've already sold my house and all my clothes. I called you... to sell you one of my children. -What are you saying, mister? -Take Adam... so I'll have the money to feed Mustafa. Or take Mustafa, so that I'll have the money to feed Adam. I work as a clerk in the morning and as an accountant in a restaurant in the afternoon. Still, I can't afford my expenses. So you're selling your own flesh and blood? I've already sold the furniture and my clothes. I only have this suit left. I sleep in it and go to work in it. Please, son, take Mustafa. He's very good. He'll do whatever you want. His mother and I will only come once a month to see him. I need to speak to you. How much do I earn per day? Fifty pounds. Could I get two days' wages? Here you are. You're very generous. What do you want, my son? Please, accept this money. I know it's only a small sum. But if God gives me more, I'll bring it to you. Consider me your son. Thank you very much, my son. Surely... surely, God won't forget this. Please accept this. The prophet himself accepted gifts. Peace and blessing be upon him. This is the cost of Mustafa. Tomorrow, I'll bring you the cost of Adam. May God help us in this life and the hereafter. Let's hear your ululating! Let's hear your ululating! Why are you sitting?

Get up and play Why are you silent? Start clapping That's him That's her Why are you sitting? Get up and play Why are you silent? Start clapping Salutations from my hand Salutations from my eyes Salutations from my heart What's all this? You know, Barakat, I used to sing that song to Um Afaf whenever she grew tired of me. She'd get sick of me and go to her family's house! Honestly, I was so unpleasant to her. I was very naughty. I'd do naughty things, then sing... Three salutations to the one I miss She'd come back immediately. A lady. She was a lady like no other. May you rest in peace, Um Afaf. She would always stand by me and support me. Without her, I would have been nothing. You think you're something? Have you become an ambassador? -You're the whole world to me. I'm joking. -That's it! You take it back. Of course, I take it back. I have to tell you, the guy who takes Hayam from me will be taking my heart from my chest. Why such exaggeration? She ain't a mermaid. God, give me patience. Every time I get worked up talking to you, you go and say such nonsense. Uncle Rida, I need to talk to you about something. -What is it? Not money, I hope. -What's the matter, Dad? Is there no one left but Barakat to hang out with? How can you say that? You're my eyes, my eyebrows, my liver, my spleen! -Okay, Dad. -You mean the world to me. -Enough, Dad. -You are my sweetheart. Him? He's nothing. -Tell us, mermaid... -What? Why do we take the scrap from person to person, wasting time? Why don't we just take it straight to the recycling factory? Don't tell me that you need to sweat to earn your bread. Nowadays, with your forehead sweat, you can barely afford a shower, and a bar of soap. Listen closely, Dad. If he's talking about soap, that means he'll present us with a nice, clean idea. -Sure, but I don't understand him! -To put it simply, we should expand our trading. I can see you in high places. -That's where I was, long ago. -Continue, Barakat. Don't you think of me like your son, Othman? -Trust in me. -I do consider you a son of mine. I feel like I fathered you. -Thank God. -God have mercy on you. Let's pray the morning prayer. Are you gonna pray in these ballet clothes? Look. Give me your finger. Yes. -Exactly the right size. -Wow! Thank you so much, baby! What a surprise! Just wait till you see the big surprise! -This is too much. -Don't you wanna know what it is? -Tell me. -A holiday in Europe. Don't we need to get Mustafa's death certificate so I can be divorced? For the court to issue a death certificate and divorce you, Mustafa needs to have been missing for three years. If you try to get the death certificate and divorce too quickly, the court will regard you with suspicion Why do you need a divorce, anyway? We're happy like this. Uncle Rida, Barakat, I must have 48,000. Listen, man, you're not getting any more money from me, But will an extra 2,000 take you to heaven? I can't argue with you, Barakat. Don't do me wrong like this. Please. I have a big heart. I'll keep my oath until I go to meet God. Please, brother. Give me some wiggle room. Here's your wiggle. Now, be straight with me. -Play. -I'll play. Look, a 2,000-pound difference isn't that much. God will bless you and keep evil away from you. Okay, Barakat. For your sake. I have a big heart. Congratulations to you and Uncle Rida. Thank you! This is how men should conduct themselves. Count your money. -You just keep cheating. -I'll win this game 31 points to zero. Zero? You're so sly. I hope I won't be buried near you. The key, pal. My final price is 1,200 pounds. -For this? -Yes. Are you being silly? I'm offering the smallest pyramid for sale. Can you find a buyer for me? I get it, you don't shoot straight, -but I'm a straight shooter. -What's your name? -It's Barakat. -Make it 1,000, then. No, only the 700 we agreed upon on the phone. Should we call it a deal? 'Cause God knows I can't afford what you're asking. -What? -You heard me. You're just pretending you haven't heard. Do I go empty-handed, or am I taking this? Okay, take it. You're so sly. I hope I won't be buried anywhere near you. Where's a good man when you need him? In the name of Allah! Go ahead. Where will we spend the night? Every Thursday, we spend the night at my place and have some fun. I don't understand why you insist on going out tonight. Just for a change. Sorry, I forgot my phone. -I'll wait for you in the car. -Okay. Quickly, Barakat! I'm wiping away my sweat. In the name of Allah! I'm sorry, Madam. A bit tighter, Barakat. Yes. Tighten it on your side. -I'll throw the rope, you throw it back. -Okay, Throw it. -Pull it! -Very good! Have a safe journey! Take care of yourself, Barakat! Tell me. What did you do? I checked the car's plates. It belongs to someone called Rida Alsayed Hanafi -from Basateen. -I'm telling you, Hassan, if Mustafa is still alive, it'll be a disaster for us. I feel like I'm going mad. Maybe it's just someone who looks like him. But how can that be? I'm sure it's Mustafa. If he's Mustafa, why didn't he recognize you? That's what you're supposed to figure out. I'll tell our associates abroad and see what they make of this. Get off the arm of the chair! It's still new! It could break! -I'm just very happy! -I'm very happy, too. It looks expensive! Barakat, how much did you pay for it? I got it for 1,750 pounds from the doorman. In the market, it would cost three to four thousand pounds. It's a great sofa. That's too much! -Don't I deserve a sofa, Hamdi? -Of course, but how do I pay him? God is generous, Hamdi, but you have to take it slowly. He'd fall and break his neck if he did. Don't worry. God will only ask you for something you can tolerate. Just give the haji 750 and pay the remaining thousand in installments of 100. I can easily do that, friend. Don't say "friend", call me your good fellow! -Then, it's a deal well-struck. -A good deal's a sign of good luck. Look at your wife, the truck. Tell me, instead of chattering about deals and trucks, -who do you mean by the truck? -Don't worry, I got it for 700. And the 50? For transportation. I'm asking for exactly what I need. You know, a man's gotta eat. What's that in your hands? Did your mom send you get her some bread? What can I do for you, boss? Thanks, mister. Where is Rida's dump? -Rida who works in the junk business? -Yes. -It's right over there. -Over there? -Yes. -Thank you, sir. You're welcome. I wish you a morning as sweet as honey, cream, and jam! I'm sticking to you like glue. Though you only have eyes for the guy with amnesia. Oh, my heart! I hope you get pain in your heart, a knife in your chest, and a fracture in your leg! Aren't you too old to have such shitty manners? -What's that in your hand? -Leave him! -Leave him! -You'll get yourself in trouble. What's wrong with you? What's that in your hand? Have you no shame? Shame brings you nothing but loss, you spoiled brat. I swear, I didn't go near her. They asked Shemal to swear an oath, he said, "by my honor!" Why so serious, pal? Be careful, or you might hurt yourself. Get your hands off me! -Enough. -Enough, Uncle Rida? You think I've had enough? I swear, if you come close to Hayam again, I'll rip you in half. -Are you threatening me? -No, I'm warning you! If you don't control yourself, I'll surprise you. Look, my dear, if you wanna see a surprise, look in the mirror when you get up in the morning. If it's crystal clear and you don't see it, you're blind. If it's crystal clear and you don't see it, uncover your eyes. Enough, guys! Why are you interfering? It's our problem, and we solve it with love. Now, I ain't gonna touch you. Do the honors, boys! And take turns kicking his ass. -Oh, my God! -I'll tear you to pieces! What happened to you? Against Superman you wouldn't have got your asses handed to you like this. -Now, don't tell me there were too many. -What could we do? He's a tough guy. No, he's as soft as they come. Spit on them, Heema. How do you like that? Didn't I tell you, if it's crystal clear and you don't see it, uncover your eyes? Don't be too sensitive, my son. Don't let your anger get the best of you. If trouble comes your way, ignore it. I did ignore it, until I couldn't. What was I supposed to do? I wasn't going to fight, but I had to defend Hayam's honor. -Barakat supports all of us, Dad. -Support? Because of him, the car was damaged and I was injured! How can I help it, with my bad luck? -I'll pay the costs. -You won't pay anything. Thank you so much for what you did for us. Stop acting a fool! Everything was fine in the end. "Fine"? Look at my face! If you had a shred of dignity in your body you'd shut up! Know what else I have? Blood! All over my face! Be patient with me, Uncle Rida. -They're chit-chatting outside like women. -That's enough, Barakat. He's got nothing on you, or us. Get him off your mind. Mustafa is a stranger in this area. He lost his memory. Did they respond? They responded. They want him alive. What could they want from him? He lost his memory. It's over for him, and for us. How can you guarantee that he totally lost his memory? Maybe it's a trick, so he can continue his research without us knowing. Even if we assume that he really lost his memory, how can we guarantee it won't come back? We'll all be in big trouble. Don't you worry, sweetheart. What do you want me to do now? I want you to monitor him 24 hours a day. Don't lose sight of him for one moment. I want to know what he's doing and who's helping him. We have to know everything he does until we can make a decision about him. So, we should station our men there. Focus, here. What do you know about him? I don't know anything about this guy except that they found him with a bump on his head at some dump. They took him in to live with them and called him "Barakat". We want to know whether he has really lost his memory, or whether he's playing with us. He plays with the genies. I haven't felt comfortable since I first saw him. I thought he must be trouble. But I don't like to speak about someone behind their back. I'll write a check. How many zeroes? Zeroes? As many as you like. Five hundred grand? Good? In return, you'll work hard and you keep this to yourself? It's a good amount of money, sir. I won't even say it to myself so that I don't jinx it. -So, what does he do for work? -He's in chemical research. Chemical research? So, he's a junkie? I thought he was an addict from the start. "Chemical research" means he's a scientist. A scientist! Like Ahmed Zewail, Salah, and people like that? -He shouldn't be mentioned alongside-- -I'm telling you now, just do your work. I will. -Won't you come in? -Well, I'm not going anywhere. She wants to entrap me! Look, sir, I'll tell you what I saw. I thought I'd take a walk at night to get some fresh air. I saw that the light in the coop was on. I thought, "right! He must be doing something dirty in the coop!" I sneaked inside. I found him writing I-don't-know-what, copying things from here to there, so intensely focused. I think he's playing with you. He hasn't lost his memory. Can you bring me these papers? Or photograph them without him noticing? They're chemical compounds. Some of it is intelligible, some of it unintelligible. There are chemical signs for unknown substances. He must go to a lab to try these compounds. There are people helping him, for sure. -Good morning, Barakat. -Good morning. -Take me with you. -Where are you going? -Anywhere. -"Anywhere" isn't on my way. Not on your way? Okay. What's the news? Bad news. The car doesn't want to start. When I return, I'll take it to the mechanic. -Where are you going? I want to talk. -Now's not the time. Tell Hayam to gather the scrap before I come back. I don't understand where you go at the start of every month. Don't worry about me, Uncle Rida, please. -Just pray for me. -May God protect you. -I want to talk! -Okay. I'll be back soon. Oh, God. Tell me, haji. Why did you need me? Look, the issue of reputation is sensitive. A bullet that doesn't kill still makes a mess. What did our forefathers say? "Get your daughter a groom before you get your son a bride." That's why I'm going to be frank with you. I want you to marry my daughter, Hayam. What do you say? I can't reject you, haji. You've always been a man You respect those who respect you And you take action against those who ever think of belittling you You've always been a man You respect those who respect you And you take action against those who ever think of belittling you In the book of manhood Your name is on the first page It's been engraved there for years It's been engraved there for years A man to everyone You find your place everywhere Full of bravery Full of bravery Your dad gave you the habit That if anyone came to you Your dad gave you the habit That if anyone came to you They'd find that you support them They'd find that you support them Standing beside them in their hardships Strengthening their hearts Everyone is a witness to it In front of everyone In happiness and sadness You never abused your strength with the poor and kind In front of everyone In happiness and sadness You never abused your strength with the poor and kind You never unlawfully earned a penny You never said anything to hurt God's subjects Everyone knows From the way you look They all stand still Your dad gave you the habit That if anyone came to you Your dad gave you the habit That if anyone came to you They'd find that you support them They'd find that you support them Standing beside them in their hardships Strengthening their hearts Everyone is a witness to it Here you are, Basha, these are all the papers I found in his coop. Go now. I don't need to tell you what could happen to you if someone found out that you met me here. -I just want my check, Bash... -I'll talk to you tomorrow. Things between men are never lost. Do you expect me to work for the sake of love? Love alone doesn't earn a living. It doesn't buy you mangoes. It leaves the refrigerator empty. God, give me strength. Science has progressed a lot, sir! -What's up? -What did you do? Who told you to bring him here and expose us? Are you mad? Don't worry, sir. He's just a fool. -We can get rid of him with a bullet. -You're hardly the expert on that. If you were, we wouldn't have to deal with Mustafa. I can't live in fear, Fouad. This isn't what you promised me. Will you keep it together? -So, did he arrive at anything? -Did he arrive at anything? This research is too dangerous. -But it's almost complete. -What do we do? What do we do? I can only email these papers to them today. As long as Mustafa Alsebeeli is alive, we're in danger. We must get rid of him as soon as possible. Ayman, monitor the entrances and exits to the neighborhood. Be careful! Be careful! Don't harm Mustafa! Where's Lubna? Oh, my God! What's happening, Barakat? The best solution for you is to pretend you lost your memory. This research is more important than my life. Stay with those who rescued you for a while. -I saw Serine with Fouad. -I know, Doctor. -I've finished the research. -Then we have to close the case. For the next stage, your wife has to see you. Sorry, madam. -What am I to you? -The cure to everything. A spoonful of sugar in a bitter drink. As long as Mustafa Alsebeeli is alive, we're in danger. -Ready, Doctor? -Yes. -Congratulations on your promotion, sir. -Congratulations to you, Doctor. I'm happy to welcome you in this celebration to honor the scientist Dr. Mustafa Alsebeeli for his scientific achievements in fighting and treating viral diseases. HONORING DR. ALSEBEELI FOR HIS ACHIEVEMENTS IN TREATING VIRAL DISEASES I thank you and all those who stood by me, especially Lieutenant Colonel Muhammed Sami. He stood by me and put his own life in danger. I thank the security forces, who stood by me and protected my research. Today is the tomorrow that I was afraid of yesterday. Today, I learned to never fear. Yesterday, I learned that the treasure is in the journey, the journey where I learned the meaning of reality, fate, and dreams. The reality we all live in, from our first feeling of pain to a banner bearing the words "private hospital." I realize here that, as long as science and medicine are under private ownership, there isn't medicine or science, nor, I'm sorry, is there a government. Those who don't have money must reside in the dirt. Fate, although we fear it, can't be contradicted. It has helped me see, among those who are illiterate, knowledge of the world. And among those in poverty, the richness of the soul. I lived among people who taught me what it is to sit around a modest table, what a family gathering truly means, what bravery and manhood mean... what the word "countryman" means. I have met people I wish I had met a long time ago. I felt, in them, the vulnerability of the poor where the only treatment for illness is aspirin, and yet, somehow, they recover. I found that satisfaction in life is a type of worship. It is the best worship. Sitting around a modest table of food is an expression of love much warmer... than heart emojis or clicking "like". We smile at our phones more than we smile at each other. Life has turned into plastic. Dreams, however, are the long paths we have to walk... at the end of which you find yourself, who was created for a purpose. You should strive to achieve that purpose in spite of the difficulties you face... difficulties everyone else has faced. God doesn't plant a dream inside someone's heart unless He knows that they can achieve it. You can achieve it. Thank you all. Long live Egypt. DR. MUSTAFA ALSEBEELI STRANGELY DISAPPEARS A REWARD FOR WHOEVER FINDS HIM I know who you are. -Your name is Dr. Mustafa Alsebeeli. -I've known that you know for a while. I just want you to stay by my side. How can you agree with my dad about our engagement? -Aren't you married? -We must play this charade to perfection. I want to thank you for standing by my side. Why thank me? I didn't do anything. I'll see you. Heema. -Hayam. -I have this ring, but I need to know if it's your size or you'll give me hell about it. I'll give you hell! Hell it is, then.
