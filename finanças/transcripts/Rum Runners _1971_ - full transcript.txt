It's the prohibition. In 1925, off U.S. waters, the Rum Row is the operation field of rum smugglers, sailors who smuggle alcohol to the United States from the Caribbean islands. Hurry up, guys. We will cast the anchor very soon. - Make faster. - Let me see. Two more there or they will be broken. - All right, Captain. Pedro. You must stitch that one. Rio Grande. If there's trouble we'll take cover in Mexican waters. We can throw. Come on guys, throw. You're a big bastard, sir. No, I'm polite, Captain, that's all. When a woman knocks at my door I open. I can't help it. Especially when she's as beautiful as yours. Maintain the course. A nice French bastard. That's what you are. A nice French Italian bastard. What are you waiting for? We're not gonna spend the night here! You hold the wheel, okay? Please stop papers control. Come about and prepare for boarding. Throw the load! Full swing, we have Coast Guards at our heels! Please stop or I shoot! Fantastic! Come on, boys. We got work to do. Do I see what I think I see? Look at those bottles! - Let's get it over with! Fire at will! Let's keep these two to celebrate Independence Day. (Cries and shouts) Watch out! You just shot the motherfucker! American Dollars. Oh! He. Be careful, this is my last. Shh. I won't tell him. Be careful, it's very hot! Bless you and your services, General. General? Me? To the revolution. General, do you want to earn money? A lot of money. Those yes, Anyone who shoots bets $300. I switch off the light and we count to 10. Meanwhile, in the dark, you can go wherever you want blindly but silently. Like that. And then they do not know where you are. Then they shoot randomly. And you collect bets. - And this one who just came out? - Oh, he was just an unlucky guy. A stray bullet. Why don't you do it then? An innkeeper is not used to bullets as a general. Yes, but the general prefers to wash the dishes. How much can you earn? These ten Americans are very rich. You make $5000 every pass. They are so drunk there is no risk. You can make three passes. 15,000, General! 15,000 for your revolution! Come on. This is my cousin Enrique. He's mute. I need to know for sure. Is he mute or is he blind? Enrique has heart and brains. Me, I'll shoot at his brains. And you? Don't worry, Enrique. We'll send you up there without pain. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I keep $500 for arbitration. Are you ready, gentlemen? Ready! Ready! When you wish, gentlemen. You speak very well for a mute Mexican. When a man confesses he's mute and Mexican ... it really means he's mute and Mexican. When you want, Mister. When you please, gentlemen. Here we go. Ten.. Nine.. Eight... Seven.. Six.. Five.. Four.. Three.. Two.. One. Bastard! - We'll get him next time. - Bravo, mister. Well, Enrique, you try again? Yeah! Are you ready, gentlemen? Ready! Yeah! Eight.. Seven.. Six... Five.. Four.. Three.. Two.. One... Fire! Very good, sir! After a trick like that, you can withdraw with honor. In place, gentlemen. You're a real General! Ready, gentlemen? Ready! Four.. Three... Two.. One... $20,000, General! 20000 $. You must stop now! It's over, Enrique? Ready, gentlemen? OK. Ready? Yeah. Ok. Yeah. Ok. Yeah, i'm ready. Three.. Two.. One... Fire! 1-- Enough is enough! The lady of my heart. The lady... of my heart. I've never seen such a wretched boat! Nationality? Nicaragua. Do you know the captain? Wait. It is Cornelius. Jerry, it's Cornelius! Huh? Without a beard! Bloody hell! Cornelius in the flesh! Have a seat, darling. I stopped 6 bullets to have my ship. Here, here, right here, here, here. And one here who got me an haircut. That's why I like it so much, "The lady of my heart." You had chance with you. Why not continue? Because I was unconscious. Eleven times! It's not easy, right? You sail as an assistant with Pete Dutchman. You fall into the sea, you disappear for 6 months ... And you return as captain. And even shipowner! Cantacas is right. You're in luck. What do you mean? The ones who are not at the bottom of the sea are in jail in Atlanta, with Pete Dutchman. But you know how to swim. That's what I meant. To say that, Loisel. You have to have a twisted mind. You are crazy! Both of you! You're right, Jerry. You must be crazy to pretend to be blind. You should withdraw your words, Loisel. Drop it. The commodore is right. Withdraw them. Alright, let's say I did not say that. Yeah, but you mean it. And you're not the only one. Nobody thinks like that, Captain. Sit down. Thank you. Now that you know everything, I'm going to bed. Hey, Corny! I will be waiting for you tomorrow for tea. And maybe this weekend? Why not? Check this out, guys! Looks like Island Bird has a crush on King Kong! Goodbye, Miss Diana. See you tomorrow. Here, aces full. - Lucky man! Hey, Mac. Howdy, Corny! We were just wondering about you. Do you stand still without a crutch? I do not know, I have not tried yet. Here, it seems to be fine. - Not bad. Diana and I we're almost married. Do you understand? Oh, really? Maybe she's pretty tired of you lately or maybe you're not man enough for her. Stop it, you're crazy! I invite you, gentlemen, to settle this with Pure rum! Isn't it a little early? No, no. All right. Hey, Corny, it's against the rules. So we're even. Well, are you ready? Diana for the best 24 glasses. - OK. - Ready. Start! Cheers! They're equal, I'd say. Wait, it's not over. King Kong is the winner! This thug has customers with a refined taste. And he pays on the spot. - And what's the goods? - Only whiskey. - And the seller? - Donizetti. He wants $50,000. How much can you spare? Half at best. Donizetti is ready to give credit for the other half. 25,000 to 7%. Of course, if something goes wrong, our union vouchs for you. OK? It's hard to refuse. Good. You load here, in Kingston, in 48 hours. Hey, Corny! You already know where we throw anchor? Here in these waters. Towards "La Baraterie". Remus will give you the details. Thank you for choosing me. It's normal. You're still part of the Rum Row. You don't think you trust me a bit too much? And why not? Because you know how to swim? I'd like you to forget your stripes for a while. A glass? No, I can't. I have a meeting. My word, you look like a prince! I have tea with the Dominican Lady. With milk or lemon? One ticket or two? "In the forbidden city of Zucolav" "He will die at dawn" "Goodbye my friends" Alright, stand back, everybody! Stand back! Wilky! Wilky! Wilky! Ah, Wilky... Get the guys and start the engine. We set sail! But... we have not loaded yet! I don't care, we don't load anymore. One ticket, please. "They survived." "Come with me... your belong in civilization." "I belong to them... I am their property!" "I will come back and save you against your will." The End Can you load tonight? No news of King Kong then? No. Aren't you trying to offer me his contract? Do you accept or not? If Donizetti still offers 25,000 to 7% covered by the union ... I agree. The conditions have not changed. Then there's no reason for me to refuse. Captain Van Zelinga? Would you get inside please? This is an expulsion order, Captain. I'm sorry But why? You ask me too many questions, Captain. You work with cops now? You know that in my work I need to have relationships or ... I don't care about your problems! And you can eat this because I'm staying here! I took the liberty to order to fire lights! You sail in 10 minutes! I sail, I sail? And in 10 minutes? Well, it would surprise me! You have a very nice room. Loisel has blown up with his ship. He had received your contract. Nobody escaped alive? All we known is that there was a fire aboard. After that... It blew up. You and Loisel were not in good terms. And the story of Pete Dutchman resurfaced. What do you think? What do you do in Colon? So what, it can happen to anyone. Yeah. But your boys are scattered around the city and have fun with real women. They have fun and drink. They will lose their tongues. And the Channel zone is full of feds. I cannot allow that. It becomes very dangerous for everyone. - Wilky! Wilky! - Yes, Captain! Get ready for departure! Direction? Cuba, and then Kingston. Kingston. Cuba? You leave the "lady" in Kingston and catch a steamer. I booked you an apartment at the Ben More. The best hotel in Havana. - You pay my holidays? - Not really. Remus is already there. When you arrive he will find you. HAVANA, CUBA Captain Van Zelinga? Pleased to meet you. Not bad. As you say, Captain. I expect 20,000 bottles like this. Some Romane St. Vivant and Clos du Tare. A real treasure, Captain. Don't worry, we will pamper your bottles. That's not all, there's also brandy. Thirty years old, 13,000 vintage bottles. Also ... 7,000 bottles of white liquor. Cherries and raspberries. And believe me, Captain ... We were not born, neither you nor I, when these fruits were collected. The cargo expects my orders in Saint-Nazaire to set sail towards Haiti. It will discretely cast anchor in Mademoiselle Bay waiting for you. No objections? No. Reiner will accompany you to supervise the bottles transfer. Then you will dive the bags on the west coast of Florida. At White Water Bay, namely. I no longer agree. It's full of Coast Guards there. Not on this night, Florida cops will send them elsewhere. We paid the price. No matter what, I don't like this place. $20,000 in advance, Captain. Paid immediately. Plus 80,000 on delivery of the goods. This makes $100,000 net. What do you think, Captain? I agree. Hey, Bob! No, thank you, Bobby. I'll walk. Hey! Miss! Miss! I scared you? I beg your pardon. You look remarkably like her. I get that often. So I take advantage of the situation. I comb my hair like her. It's not very honest. Have you seen her in "The Cat-Woman"? No. - You didn't watch that movie? - No, no. You don't know me yet, but I just cried. - Maybe you saw her in "The Love Panther" then? - No. It happens in Africa with savages. It was her? That's right. And she was beautiful ... So beautiful you cannot imagine! And then she wants to save the traveler but it goes bad. They catch them and want to throw them on spikes. It's horrible! Wait, you know what happened then? The film caught fire! You know what I did? I set sail to Port-au-Prince. - Why? - To watch the end of the movie. - Where were you then? - In Jamaica. Three days at sea. Anyway, they make it alive except the old man. Then he wants to take her with him. At one time, he says something great. He says : "Come with me, you belong to civilization." Very beautiful. But she cannot, because she is a goddess and she has her people. You see, for me love is .. - What is it? - Captain. - Captain Van Zelinga. - Aha! Goodbye then, Captain! I was enchanted to meet you. You are also very beautiful, you know. What's your name? I thought you had guessed! Flowers? Alvarez, you're a genius! Orchids, two dozen! No, it's too cheap. Six dozen! Immediately send her six dozen orchids! No! No, no, sir! Why not? Oh, no. Only one, sir. Only a single flower, simple and pure. As your heart. A flower of wild vanilla! You think? Hello? Wait, senorita, I'll connect you with the gentleman. Senorita Larue, Captain. Yes, it's the lady! Come on, a little courage, Captain! Yes? Yes I thought you might find it enjoyable to spend the evening with me. Sure! So, see you soon, Captain. And Ronald, what do you do with him? Ronald? I'm tired of Ronald. I put him to auction. What is the starting price? He costed me $2000. Let's say 1000. He is used! Come on, try to look your best. - 1050. - 1100. Let's say 1450. And 10 cents! 1450 and 10 cents the first time! 1500! And 10 cents! And 10 cents the first time. Plus 10! Plus 10 first time. 2000 and say no more. Nice. I'll have my money back. - Can I borrow you $200? - Okay, go on. 2000 second time. 2200. 2200 first, 2200 second time ... Third time. Sold! Play something just for me! - Here you are. - Thank you, darling. I hope you will not regret it. Here is my sailor! Captain! Hey! I acted like an idiot. Please forgive me. Not at all, Captain. Your sincerity touched me. I'm glad you're here. I introduce you to Captain Van Zelinga. Commander of... Gee, I forgot ... The lady of my heart. Lady of my heart. It's so romantic! What do you transport on your ship? Weapons? Chinese people? Negroes? The Cubans, i'm sure. Come on, say it. Me, I know! Ah! Women! Oh! Not at all! I assure you! Then what? Rum Oh! - I propose a toast to the lady! - To the Lady! Of my heart. Ronald, play us something fun! Let's dance! Oh no! He's mine! Absolutely not! - I do not know how to dance ... Spoiled child, daddy's girl. She is too skinny. She does not have a heart. Forget her captain. She's not your kind. Be right back. Have I seen you somewhere? In the movies, perhaps. You are the traveler! It is amazing. It is wonderful when you say "Come with me, you belong to civilization." I belong to them I am their queen. Will you dance, Linda? Excuse us, Captain. You have forsaken me, this isn't nice! - You do not drink? - For a pirate that's odd. Perhaps he can't hold alcohol. - Do you know the "12 beats of midnight"? - No. A game where who drinks the most wins. The fastest too. No, really, I'd rather not. Captain ... To entertain me. Oh, darling... Go. Going Bravo. Winner by default! ♪ They are his mistresses. ♪ ♪ Everything there, everything there. ♪ ♪ Waves and the salt. ♪ ♪ Between Java and Cuba. Waves and the salt. ♪ ♪ They are his mistresses. ♪ Captain! Hey! Hey! Hey ! Hey ! Did you sleep well? Hurry up, we're going on a picnic. Hey! Here he is! Captain ! You thought you were going alone? It can't be! Captain! Faster! Give me the wheel! Come on, we'll lose them! Shall we dance, Captain? You know I cannot. Come on, I'm going to teach you. Going. You see ? It's not that hard. Are you shy, Captain? You never kiss women? Certainly, Miss, it happens. And in general, when do you do that? So what, fix it! Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, we are happy to have tonight with us: Miss Linda Larue. Can I come with you? No. It's better this way. Let's be reasonable. Why risk to ruin everything? I am so, so happy. Oh, a flower of wild vanilla... Good night, sir! Poor Captain. You left him hungry once more? Someday, he'll wring your neck. He turns pale everytime I grab his hand. I find this very exciting. Do you? Come in. Ah! Did you see the news, Doc? Yes, yes. I'm afraid that Corny has forgotten the order. If we lose Remus, we lose our best customer. All because of this panther. And the funny thing is, he did not even sleep with her. You're kidding? Nothing, nothing at all! He didn't even kiss her foot. Alvarez's report is very clear. This bitch has kept the pressure on him for 8 days. And she escapes every night before the explosion. I have an idea. An autograph, please. - An autograph, an autograph... - Thank you. - An autograph, please. "My beautiful, frigid whore!" "I'm completely sick of your movies." "Instead of a love panther, you're nothing more than a sexless cat." "Prove to me otherwise." "I am ready to give you a chance." "Herewith, a little money," "to pay the taxi and buy you." Congratulations, sir, you know how to express yourself. And if she doesn't break after that, then I don't know anything about women! Here comes the signature. - Here it is - Thank you, mister. This one seems very good to me. Good. "My beautiful, frigid whore!" Ms. Larue, what an honor! Where is he? I want to see him! Get that dirty rat out of his hole! Mr. Captain came out, went for a walk... He went for a walk. Calling me a whore! - No. He went for a walk. He went for a walk.! Ah! Aha! Aha! Dirty rat! Dirty rat! Dirty rat! Dirty rat! Dirty rat! Dirty rat! Dirty rat! Dirty rat! Get off me! Help! Help! - Problems? - Yes. What's the situation with our friend? They don't go out, they open only for food. - Yes? - Breakfast, sir. Jerry ! - What are you doing here? - You don't know? You're a famous person, you know. You want an autograph? Tell me . .. This letter was great. I would never have thought to write it on my own. It was not really my idea. Thanks anyway. Linda, let me introduce you to Commodore Sanderson. It's a pleasure, Miss. I'm troubled, Commodore. You want something to drink? I'm not on duty. I brought your ship. Are you coming or not? I stay. It's certainly preferable for you. And if I asked you to give me "The Lady" for 15 days? - Do I have a choice? - No! I'm sure it's all my fault. Not at all, miss. Unfortunately, it's mine. Friends? Friends. I will set sail tomorrow morning. Something special to say? No. Oh, yeah. No need to push it, it will never go up 7 knots. I get it. Goodbye, Miss. Won't you have lunch with us? Tempting, but it's impossible. - Mr. Reiner? - Wilkinson, second officer. The Captain awaits you. Can I? Thank you. Well, yes. It's me traveling with you. - Disappointed? - No, on the contrary. We have a problem, Reiner. A serious one. The "Ruisnor" has exploded 2 days ago as Loisel did. Coast Guards have boarded the "Flying Turtle". Bad luck at this point, I do not believe it. Someone has betrayed us. I'm sure Van Zelinga? In any case, he has ants in his pants. Just in case I decided to change the place of delivery. You will warn Remus. I will try. He should be in New Orleans tonight. Okay, look. We skip White Water. And we continue another day toward the south. Right here exactly. Sanderson will be aboard? How very interesting. We'll make sure we don't miss him. All right. What's their position? 2 miles, 3 cables west of Rocky Point. Yes. On a bank 10 fathoms deep. Here is "The Lady." Beautiful, isn't it? Oh, yes Come on, my four-legged loves. Hang on, I'm coming. - No! You're crazy! - Why? I have the right to travel on my ship. Come on, let me pass. Get those bags out! If not, I'll do it. Listen, Jerry, okay, you're the captain. But I'm still the owner! And Miss Larue is my guest. Oh no, come on, Betty. Do not cry. Listen, Corny, try to understand, it's not a pleasure cruise. Let's say that she will be the second boy. Anyway, I recorded her as such in the crew. See for yourself. Of course, you will free her from work. Farewell! I have fans, Commodore. OK, Jerry? What's wrong with him? Oh, he always dramatizes. Come, I will show you "The Lady." Oh! Oh, Corny... Wilkie, be ready to sail at any moment in case of trouble. And I don't want to see the movie star on the bridge, ok? - It won't be easy, Captain ... - I don't care. Alright, Captain. Real smugglers! Oh, Corny, this is so exciting! Let's take a closer look! You can't go out like that! Bathrobe. What does this mean? - Wilky! Wilky! - Yes, Captain? - What's wrong? Open the door! - No, Captain! He's crazy or what? Be reasonable, Wilkie, open to us! Impossible, miss, I have orders. Orders from above. From above, you say... We'll see about that! Damn Wilkie! Thank you, Captain. Very well, everything's there. - Good luck. - No, Reiner, the journey continues. I leave you here as promised. I changed my mind. You are crazy, Sanderson! Remus won't like it. Easy, Reiner, he wired to send his agreement. So? You may go, boys. I'm staying. I never liked White Water. Don't worry. You will not see any Coast Guard tonight. Oh, really? They're busy waiting for us in Rocky Point waters. - Ready, Captain. - Good. Full speed ahead! It's up to you, Wilkie. Cape to the south, 30 east. Cape to the south. Say so. - Tell me, where are you going? - At Rocky Point. But you just said that the Coast Guards will look for us there? So what? Officially we have only delivered tobacco and rice from Santo Domingo to Vincent. Blimey! This guy is totally insane! I don't know why, I'm always hungry. Blame the sea. Gosh! What did he do? What are you doing here, Reiner? Ask him. I want the skin of that snitch. You understand, Reiner? No. I told you we would cast anchor at Rocky Point. You are the only one who knows. With me. Rocky Point! If the Coast Guards are there ... it means you've set up a meeting with them. Slowly Okay. Well right, like that Hello. Cornelius, look there! Two ships! They raised the yellow and blue flag! "Stop immediately or you will sink." In your place I would stop. Especially with Miss Larue on board. That's what we'll do. Since we're in order. Full speed ahead. It's time to show your guts! Bastard! Fire! Come on, Corny! Corny ! Corny... 20 to the right! Only 10. Stay the course. Fog to hundred fathoms. Fire! 10 to the right. We're almost there. Are you okay? Where are you going, old pal? You don't like rum? There at the helm, keep the north! 45 west on the compass! Understood, course north, 45 west! Officer! Officer, turn the board to the left. 10 degrees to the left. 10 degrees to the left. Ask a little help from the machine too. Yes, sir. Full speed ahead. I allow myself to remind you, sir, that you have two ships on the starboard side. Yes, sir. We have to salute them. Raise our flag. - You've won your stripes, Linda. - Good God, I was scared. Am I interrupting something? Oh, Corny, you're alright? But you're drunk, you smell rum! I am dead drunk. Him too. Go get dressed, darling! You're indecent. You see what's cooking up there? What is he doing there, that Englishman? It seems he wants to cover us. Hold the wheel! We will accompany them to the end of the U.S. territorial waters. What are you doing? I say hello to the Englishman. If they shoot they hit the Englishman. Then they'll have to deal with the King of England! These Americans could greet us. Don't you think? Yes, sir. Reduce the speed. Hey, Jerry, the Yankees are done! We're out of their waters! Many thanks, sir! Who am I speaking to, sir? Gerald Mortimer Sanderson! William Percival Rupert Plantagenet Hammond. 14th Marquis of Essex, 11th Count of Shetland. Do you know this guy? 17th Viscount of Fairlisle. I am at your orders, Commodore! - I got injured men on board. - I'll take care of them, Commodore. I just rallied longfleet! Think about it Linda, no need to rush. I already made my mind. The answer is "Yes." That's all? I'll have to tell you sooner or later. Really? So what? Bill Hammond asked me to marry him. What? I imagine his head when you said no. Honey ... I said yes. You could have waited for me to finish my steak. Are you mad at me? I knew very well that you would not spend your life on this rotten old tub. Marquess of Essex! Can you imagine? And the Duchess of I do not know what. I really couldn't refuse. And he will introduce me to the King. Very well. You will become a damn Marquise. When do you leave? For now, I only need to change ship. Just like that. Long live the bride!

Nice talk but what's the bet? It is said that Captain Van Zelinga is a master at the blind man's game. Well... If Lady Hammond has not disgraced herself with you let's say to 8 days, I'm sure, Captain, you will voluntarily play the blind man twelve times in a row again, right? Yes. Otherwise... I'm ready to do it an indefinite number of times. No sir, this is a gamble, not a suicide. If you lose, you will do it 12 times. At your orders, Commodore. I agree. But on one condition... Linda does not have to know anything. Of course. Everyone heard that? Then hold your tongues. Thanks for your invitation. No! Yes! Burn it all. Yes, Captain. Captain, a question ... No! The Duchess. Sylvain ! How's the Marquise? If you are very busy, I can come later. No, no ... Absolutely not. But... What are you doing? He spends his nights reading me "The Room of the Coast's Brotherhood"! Go! Go, hurry up! This way! Come on! There, there! - There? - Yes, there. Oh! Fantastic! No doubt about it. Okay, enough. You've seen enough. Pull him up. Go on. Radiu, will you come up here for a second? It's ok? "I, the undersigned, notary in Kingston, declare, in front of witnesses, that I saw.." "Miss Linda Larue become Lady Plantagenet Hammond in marriage," "Marquise of Essex, Countess of Shetland, and Countess of Fairisle" "giving herself willingly to Captain Van Zelinga..." "without him applying any sort of violence against her." Perfect, sir! Yes, yes! "This, written on the 21st of june 1928, may be used as evidence, in case of need." If the witnesses agree to sign. Now we'll see how brave this Englishman is. Yes, yes. It's a stupid bet, sir. I ask you to renounce. You disappoint me, Commodore. I congratulate you, Captain. You'll see. Everything will be fine. Ready, gentlemen? Ready. Ready. Ready. Ten... Oh! Shut up, baby. Or we'll ﬁll you full of holes. Get it? Thieves! Thieves! Ready, gentlemen ? You have met all the requirements of honor, sir. Please stop here. Reload, gentlemen! Okay, well then. - Are you ready? - Ready. A moment! Well, it was just a joke. Just a joke? What does it matter? You have proven your courage. I take that as an insult, Captain Van Zelinga. We will settle our dispute tomorrow under the laws of the Coast's Brotherhood! But what's wrong with you? Say at 6 am on your bridge. With Cutlass as weapon! Very clever. Betty! My babies! My four-legged loves! What do you think of the scene? These two have a future... in the roles of villains. You'll pay your ransom with a successful movie! Or a very bad trial! Forget everything and start from scratch. Stevens has a sensational idea! - Your adventures amongst these pirates. - It's silly. It's great! It's worth billions! A few days later...On the U.S. east coast. Hello, Captain! - Wilkie ... - Yes, Captain. I think someone will have to take care of the lady. So... Maybe... Here, it's yours. What? It's not a good ship? Where are you going? I am going to take a walk to Hollywood and after that I'll see. and after that I'll see. Good God, am I dreaming? There is the husband of your woman! - Captain, our duel! - Oh, no. You can run but no one has escaped from William Percival Rupert ... Can I shoot him? Forget it, go ahead. You're a coward, Van Zelinga! Under the laws of piracy! Do you agree, Captain? Wilkie, go away now. No, Captain. Get out, I tell you! That's an order! Come on, get out! Defend your honor, Captain! Ok, I agree, I agree. - Ready? - Yes, ready, ready. Beware! Hey, hey! England forever! Shut up, the english! Between us, milord, why do you wear this patch? It's in memory of those who died at Trafalgar. Milord, do you hear? Captain! Captain! One, two... One, two... Come on, sir, a little courage! Hey, Remember! I want them alive! Where is my sword? My sword! Read all about it! Cris dejoie. Ho! For me, it will be a beer! Over here, the beer. Health! Cheers. Eight years waiting for this moment! Well, yes. All the same, you are still the same bastard! French Italian bastard! Are you okay? This is for Diana! How are you, Corny? Hey guys, take it easy! Hey! England forever! England forever! Another one! Excuse me please. Mister! Mr. Van Zelinga, finally, entirely at your service! Just a minute. Excuse me. Excuse me. Please. Let's not start again! Hey you, what do you want from him?
