A NIKKATSU PRODUCTION NIKKATSU SCOPE PERFECT GAME Based on the short story by SHINTARO ISHIHARA Screenplay by YOSHIO SHIRASAKA Cinematography by MINORU YOKOYAMA Production Design by BUGEN SAKAGUCHI Music by RIICHIRO MANABE KOUICHI KAWABE Edited by MASANORI TSUJII STARRING AKIRA KOBAYASHI IDSUMI ASHIKAWA MARI SHIRAKI MASUMI OKADA Directed by TOSHIO MASUDA Is this a game? It started out as a game. But we didn't know that evil was lurking there, waiting for us. What can we do now? What can we do to atone for our sins? How much do you need for now? 20,000 to 30,000, I'd say. I'd like that much, too. I owe Yumiko about 20,000. A girl lends you money, no need to pay it back. It doesn't work that way. When she pays, she pays. I asked her for a loan this time. Don't talk like that. Why do you ask? Got a way to make money? Of course not. I'm looking for one. It's the recession. Even worse for us students. I'm tired of cheap fun. But not ballsy enough to shake some down. You may not be ballsy, but aren't you crafty? Isn't there another sweet deal like Tani's Jaguar? Tani's Jaguar? That was pure luck. His dad's company imported a Jaguar but couldn't find a buyer. So Mitsuda... The heir to Toyo Trading. We threatened him and forced his dad to buy it. Tani's dad was happy to sell at cost. So we got 200,000 out of the deal. Tani was on board. Split four ways, 50,000 each. It lasted three days in Hakone and Atami. That's one sweet deal. I'm waiting for another sweet deal like that. Betting on horse races? No good, Toda. Your hunches are way off these days. - What about bicycle races? - Same deal. - The same? - Yeah. There are four of us and we can't come up with a single plan? I don't see blood. You haven't hit bottom yet. What if we were stronger? Wouldn't do any good. We're all struggling in vain. Let's just not commit any crimes, okay? By the look in your eyes, seems you're ready to go down there. I got it. Again? So-chan, you say that all the time. Why don't you lease out this house and collect the rent? You gotta be kidding. I'm just a house sitter, freeloading here. Just until your painter cousin comes back from the U.S. Stop with the petty schemes, will you? I might as well go home and read a book. A book? You surprise me, Toshio. Don't worry. It's probably got a naked girl with a knife in her tits on the cover. A married woman with animal lust and a ruthless killer? A law book. ''Laws on Bills of Exchange.'' You're in the class, but you never show up. Shimazaki's class on promissory notes is worth it. He's all about actual practice. Promissory note fraud. Confidence games. Financial fraud. Pretty practical. These days, con artists make more than bankers. You as a con artist, Toda, won't scare anybody. Fraud doesn't require menacing looks, but a pretty face and a sharp mind. It's all about having brains. In here. Why don't you use your fine brain for something more immediate? Shut up. Go home and sleep. It's still daytime. It's already 1 0:00. You stay away, you do bad things. How about yourself, Toda? I got a date with Mieko. So-chan, loan me two. Here come the killer words. Pon. Three tile sou, thank you. What the hell? - Just one short. - Yep. Lucky, aren't you? THREE DAYS LATER Any ideas for a quick buck? Like Tani's Jaguar... Stop it. ''Tani's Jaguar, Tani's Jaguar'' all the time. It's gone. Forget it. Over and over. Horrible. Even the Communist Party is more professional than us these days. What about real estate? Any companies opening hotels? There you go. I got a better idea. We might be able to make a quick buck. Finally, Toda. What is it? - A bicycle race. - No way. Your hunches are way off. We don't go on a hunch. We place a sure bet. You know about a fix? We go to a bookie. The illegal ones outside the racetrack? The police is cracking down on them. How sad the amateurs are. - There's an unlicensed one. - Where? I placed a bet with one in Kichijoji two days ago. Kawasaki Velodrome. - How'd you do? - So so. But next time, it won't be an honest bet. So what is it and how do you do it? Listen carefully. It's Kawasaki and Kichijoji. The distance is a two-hour train ride. Maybe they feel safe with the distance. In Kichijoji, they stop taking bets later than at Kawasaki Velodrome. After the cyclists cross the finish line, their man at the Velodrome calls Kichijoji with the results, but there's a delay. Why? In Kichijoji, they can't take a direct call from the Velodrome. The bookie also tries to take more bets and make a bigger profit. - Greedy aren't they? - Yeah. Even after the race is over, they keep taking bets. For how long? Five minutes minimum. - We can do it. - Right? How? You're slow, aren't you? One of us makes a bet with the bookie. Another one watches the race in Kawasaki. He calls Kichijoji with the result before the bookie gets it. l see. Then he can bet all he's got already knowing the result. Can you call so quickly? Ahead of the bookie's man? Ever hear of a ''fixed time call''? You can reserve the phone for a specific time, right? We can figure out how long a race takes from past records. We add that to the start time and reserve a phone. Where? Inside the Velodrome. Where do we call? Somewhere near the bookie. I checked two days ago. There's a department store kitty-corner from it. Won't they notice? We?ll make sure they don't. It's tricky, but not difficult. How much can we make? If a long shot wins? 300,000. That much? We need to lose 20,000 to 30,000 first or they?ll be suspicious. We can net 250,000. Two. How many do we need? Three at the bookie's. Three? Don't tell me you're leaving me out. You're lacking in the brains department. You go to the Velodrome. Just the man for the job. One to place the bet. Two to pretend they don't know anything. One of the two takes the phone call. He must be nonchalant. He uses code to tell the gambler how to bet. Toda, you should make the bet. The perfect straight-faced liar. So-chan and I bet on other racers, as if we know nothing. I?ll take the phone call, talk to So-chan, Toda will decipher the codes. What about me? - What about the codes? - It's tight. One to call from the Velodrome. That'd be me. What if it's crowded in the Velodrome and it takes time to get to the phone? One to wait by the phone, another to watch the race. We need two. That makes five. - Worried about your cut? - Yeah. We can't help it. Every second counts. Who should be the fifth one? - What about Kazu? - Kazu is stupid. You're the same. Muscles only. Such a manly man. Growing some chest hair? Tsk, tsk. This is what we get. You just say, ''Mon Ch?rie'' and cling to Toda. Of course, my man is the cream of the crop. - Oh, really? - Yeah? Cut it out. We need one more. One more? A professional. A professional? A geezer who's gambled away his fortune. They're all over the place in there. They never fail to make out who's won the race. even before it shows up on the scoreboard. We?ll hire one of them and have him call a tight finish. 5,000 yen would make him happy. Anyone on your mind? We?ll all look for one when we scout the location. - Is there a race tomorrow? - Yes. We've got four more days. We should do it on the last day. We?ll scout the area tomorrow. - But tomorrow, I- - Going to school now? - I got a job interview. - Idiot, we still got two months. You wanna back out now? I'm coming, too. Are we taking Kazu along? We?ll determine that after we take a look around. It's a matter of pay, after all. Four or five. The difference is 1 0,000. Kazu has bad friends. What about the code words? Something simple. What about girl's names? That's cool. In honor of you, Toda, number one is Mon Ch?rie's own Miss Mieko. Don't forget to cut me in for using my name. Two is your girl, Yoko. Three, Yuki. Four, Ritsuko. Five, So-chan's Yumiko. She's hot. You're doing good. So voluptuous. Six should be Kazu's Machie. He's got a new girl again? Of course. Like an automaker, there's a new model every year. What a way to put it. But I've been with my man for two years. There she goes. Okitsu, Machie and Yuki are waiting for you in Ginza. Let's see. That means... It's 6-3. You better stop drinking and study this tonight. - Right. - Exactly. When you are going to pay back my loan? You're putting it on the tab again tonight, right? Don't be cheap before a great enterprise. That's true. Let's toast our business. Before you do that, worry about tomorrow's weather. Don't worry. It?ll definitely be a sunny day. - How do you know? - I prayed for good weather. What a simpleton. These are the best seats for seeing the finish line. Okitsu, you?ll have the geezer call the result. Then you?ll run to the phone. It's good for you. You need exercise. Shut up, idiot. Let's see how long it takes to get to the phone. Hold on. The bookie will be using the phone we saw. We can't use it for a fixed time call. Then we have to keep another nearby phone to ourselves. So we need Kazu to stay at the phone. Thank you. You've been very helpful. - People line up for the phones in there. - I know. Jazz Caf? Mississippi? They've got a great band. Really? You go there often? I see. Would you like to go with me? A friend of mine plays bass at the Mississippi. Would you introduce me to him? Yeah. He's hot. Tall, good-looking. His name is Tomita. So, when? He likes to watch the bicycle races. I?ll tell him to come by. Okay. Promise? Looks like it went well. So let's plan on including Kazu. How will I send him the news? We?ll use hand flags. Red for first place. White for second. Remember, red and white. You wave them to indivate the number. For 5-3, you have to wave the red five times, the white three times. The next step would be... Ready, go! - Excuse me. - What the hell? Excuse me. Sorry. Hey, you stepped on my foot. Watch it. Sorry. Out of my way. What's the time? 1 9 seconds. Five seconds less than last time. This is tough. Why the hell do I have to run so fast? Don't complain. It's for 300,000. How can we depend on you like this? One more time. - Hey. - Hey, how did it go? Okay. It's all set. Kazu is very happy to join us. - What's his cover? - For crying out loud. Kazu is now a bass player. - He's got no ear for music. - Yeah. He can't play bass. Baseball, maybe. Toda, there are geezers everywhere, but none seems to be the ideal candidate. Don't be stupid. He?ll be the important judge. If he reads it wrong, all the money goes to the bookie. They all look exactly like what we need. You can say that again. Toda, how about him? A female wrestler. A barmaid. One at a bar and another in a cabaret. He's got four girlfriends. Yamamoto's not doing great. Hasegawa will place first. Yamamoto is the likely winner. The female wrestler is touring Niigata now. He broke up with the bar girl and he had to pay her off. The bar girl and the cabaret girl are on their period. How do you know all that? They're not your women. Look at their practice times and recent records. See, Hasegawa's chance of placing second has been .67 8. Besides, he's got only two girls. How could anyone handle four? But you - What other girls than Kichiko at Nonbei and Kaoru at Sacramento? You don't know, right? Then shut up and bet on 6-2. I like him. A bicycle racing fanatic. He's seriously into it. Bye-bye. Next up is Race Seven. A-class general, 1 600 meters. Now for the participating cyclists. Number One, Niiyama. Number Two, Yamamoto. Number Three, Kawabe. Number Four, Morishita. Number Five, Yokota. Number Six, Hasegawa. - Hey, man. - Yeah. Would you come with me? Who are you? Just for a minute. If you agree, we?ll pay you 3,000 - no, 4,000 yen more. Race Six on the last day? It's nothing. Just call the finishers in order. - It's a sweet deal. - But... You don't want it? It's just... If you refuse, we?ll find someone else. Will you do it? - Mm-hmm. - Very well. On the race day, he?ll meet you and you tell him the finishing order. - You stay with him starting at Race Four. - Yeah. - Don't lose him. - Yeah. - Don't make mistakes. - Okay. You sure we won't get caught? No one will know. Nobody knows where we live, or which bookie we?ll trick. Okitsu, just in case he calls the finishing order wrong or if it gets too confusing, you have to call it off. But, Toda, then we?ll lose money on purpose, right? It's better than placing a bet on the wrong exacta. Each of us has to come up with 1 5,000 yen as seed money before the race day. Akitani, get in touch with Kazu today or tomorrow. - Don't screw up. - Trust me. What a sweet deal. Did Toda come up with it? - Can you come up with 1 5,000 yen? - Trust me. Kazu, don't make a mess. I just cleaned up around here. She doesn't want you to eat. Peanuts. Leave me alone. Pervert. 1 5,000 yen. Is that it? - Give me your seal. - I don't have one. Then your thumbprint. You're tight-fisted. Money lending is just a sideline. Give me 1 5,000 yen. That's not enough. Minus the interest. Hey, Shylock. I've been looking for you. Please. Sorry, dear. I just had a big order. I'm closed. You loan to So-chan, but not me? Don't get excited. Shut up, girlie. Teacher! I can't even beat him up. He's a wimp. You've got a girlfriend. You can raise the funds quickly. You all got the money ready? I can't go home for a while. Your father's in a meeting. Oh yeah? You were at the Aroma in Ginza two nights ago with an attractive older man. I heard he was bold just like my old man. Oops, someone saw us? That's too bad. Jiro, what are you doing here? I got a job interview, but I can't graduate because I owe 20,000 in tuition. Idiot. You're a sad case. Why haven't you asked your mother for the money? Here. Mom's given me tuition money three times already. You were smart to use the job interview to force him. Thank you. Kazu, what about you? I'm down. Down so low. Hey. Would you loan me 1 5,000 yen? AII right. You got it. Can I open the window? Why? You stink... No, it's really humid today. The owner of the closing store l broke up with two years ago. What a body odor. lt was horrible. Toda, did you get it from Mieko? I owe her 35,000 yen now. 35,000 to Mon Ch?rie? - I'm jealous. - Me too. What about you, Okitsu? I went to the Velodrome. The Velodrome? Listen to me. I lost, down to my last penny. lt seemed like a good idea. Things rarely work out in life. - You lack imagination. - Why do you say that? What about the money? I had to plead the house-sitting hag for a loan from her secret stash. What a con artist. You need your own Mon Ch?rie girl to lend you 35,000, no question asked. If I could have one, sure. The bookie's place is above the bicycle shop. There's the entrance. Don't forget, Soji. BAGGAGE AND BICYCLE STORAGE Okay. Got it. And the nearest phone? In the department store. Once the result is in, you can reach me in a minute, even if you walk. Akitani, that's your job. There's a house phone inside, on the left. Go talk to them about a fixed time call. Give me your jacket. Shut up and give it to me. What the hell? This is snow pink, en vogue in Paris. Excuse me. You're beautiful. What a pushy man. I'm a reporter with Towa Newspaper. I need a fixed call at 2:30 tomorrow. This is a house phone. We can't do that. This is the closest and most convenient phone. Oh... It's for a feature story called ''Kichjoji at 2:30 p.m.'' I'm on a very tight deadline. Please. I understand. Let me go ask the department manager. Thank you very much. Got it. Hello, this is Number One. Mieko and Yumiko. Kazu, you don't have to use the codes. Be precise with the numbers. Then it's 6-3. 6-3? That's Machie and Yuki. I was right. So-chan, Machie and Yuki are waiting for you at Armand. I made up my mind. I bet everything on 6-3. That's how... - It should go. - It must. What time do you think it is? You're so loud, I can't sleep. How dare a stupid housemaid talk to us like that? You're just a freeloader. The master is weeping in America. Anyway, we're all ready. It's tomorrow. The showdown. Old man, you're making bets, but are your eyes really sharp? My eyes have never failed me. Don't trust me? I?ll show you. Come on. Wow. You have such a beautiful face. You look just like Paul Anka. Everybody mistook me for him when he visited Japan. What a nuisance. Would you sing his song for me? Let me ask my manager. He should be in Kichijoji at 2:30. It costs a lot to sing one song. Hello, can I place a 2:30 fixed time call? Musashino 1 450. I'm calling from Kawasaki 3-95. We're closing for Race Five. Place your bets. - How about you over there? - Give me a second. Mankichi, how is it going? I can say I'm unexpectedly happy. I found work at an iron factory. And all of you have been very kind. That's good to hear. You're still young. You can't waste your life away. I wish you the best. You'd better give up visiting bookies, Mankichi. Today's my last day. I never visit a place like - ''A place like this''? Thanks. I earn my living here. Akitani, look at that clock. If we set it back, it?ll be easier. - How come? - You're slow. This plan depends on the delay in communications. Imagine we set it back two minutes. The bookie will believe the clock and take more bets. Aren't you guys new here? Yes, but we made quite a lot. Right? Amateurs don't think too much. That's their advantage. You could say that. I made up my mind. AII right. Anyone else for Race Five? Old man, how about that? I saw it. They?ll be announcing soon. Read the board first and then complain. The long shot won. 1 ,000 at least. - We're counting on you. - Trust me. Third place, Number Eight. First place, Number Seven. Second place, Number Two. Third place, Number Eight. Time...First place, Number Seven. You got it right. Rock solid, am I not? Please keep your eyes open for the next race. My eyes are rock solid, but my wallet is empty. Next up is Race Six. You said you'd give me 4,000 yen more. I'm on a losing streak since this morning. I'm flat broke. I can't just watch. Can't you pay me in advance? Hello. Okay. Got it. Everybody, I'm now announcing the results of Race Five. Don't put on airs. Just say it. Let's see. It's 5-2. I lost again. Tsk, tsk. I dropped again. You're not lucky today. Not only today. The other day, too. You only go for long shots. How much did you lose? I have some left. I?ll win it back soon. How'd you two do? Well, not good. Hello, Brother. What? Is it your day off? What are you saying? It's my day off from the department store. Listen, Mother isn't feeling well. Come home tonight. Her heart again? Is she okay by herself? Yeah, it's nothing serious. Just the usual. I?ll come home tonight. You go home early. Yes, but now that I'm here, I?ll make you some tea. Hurry up, idiot. Oh yeah. Next up is Race Six. S-Class Selection. 2000 meters. The cyclists are.: Number One, Yamawaki. Number Two, Tsuchiya. Number Three, Takahashi. Now. Showtime. I bet on 5-2 with the favorite and 1 -5 with the long shot. We still have time. Why don't you go place a bet? Leave me alone. When the favorite and the rival touch their eyes and ears like that sometimes they're making code gestures for a fixed game. Ritsuko, Yumiko, Machie. What are you mumbling? Can you drink that much? It's good for the vocal cords. I almost forgot. I'm going to make a phone call. Where do you want to meet her? Ginza? That sounds fun. You might want to exercise prudence betting on Race Six. I can't do that. One of these days I?ll hit the jackpot. Don't you come crying then. I may be a yakuza, but I won't lie. I can handle a million or two. Go ahead and place your bet. Really? I'm not just any bookie. If I came up short on cash, I'd put up my wife as collateral. I'm not married, so I'd put up my dear sister as collateral. Poor me, a bookie's collateral. - You're still here? - I'm leaving. I made some tea. Brother, come home soon. Good-bye. ''One million or two.'' I wish I could hit the jackpot! Hello, sir. My name is Ozawa. I'm the publicity manager. - You're writing a feature story? - Yes. Please write up our department store. That would be...my pleasure. Race Six, S-Class Selection, 2,000 meters, is about to begin. Silly ideas are a waste of money. - Place your bets. - 2-1 . They've started. Hello, is this Towa Newspaper? This is Akitani with the city news. Can I talk to my editor? Your editor? Have you gone insane? Is that you, Akitani? Of course it's me. Yes, this is Akitani in Kichijoji. The weather is fine. The sun is shining. Takahashi is no good. He takes the lead, but he tires out early. See? Be a man, don't be timid. Place your bets. Takahashi will finish first. 3-4. Wait a moment. Maybe Tsuchiya will finish first. The favorite is a good bet. Tsuchiya always wins at Kawasaki. He's a sure bet. But today's race has been unpredictable. Let me think for a moment. Time's almost up. Hurry. Surprise. It's gonna be an upset. Old man, call the finish. Kazu, no word yet? Shut up. No word yet. Can't you hear the crowd? - We're closing now. - Just a second. I know it. I almost got it. What are you doing? It's coming to me. It's coming. I got a hunch. Old man. - 1 -6. - Got it. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Out of my way. Sorry. Sorry. The first and second place of the last race will be announced. after the judges examine the photo. The last race was very close. lt will be a photo finish. Please wait for the result. Ladies and gentlemen. Please keep your betting stubs. Please wait a moment. Damn it. 1 -6. 1 -6. What? 1 -6? You said 1 -6? AII right. We're closing now. I'm getting this hunch. Whatever you say. Place your bet. A man needs to know when to play. So-chan, Mieko and Machie are waiting at Armand. I made up my mind. First, 5,000 yen each on 2-5 and 5-2. And 1 -6 and 6-1 . No, 1 -6. I bet all this on 1 -6. AII right. That's interesting. Now, whatever will be will be. Either I win or I'm flat broke. First place, Number One. Second place, Number Eight. Third place, Number Five. First place, Number One. Second place, Number Eight. I'd rather die if I don't win this one. Didn't you say you were never coming back here? That's him. Hello. 3-6. It's 3-6, right? Come on, 3-6. You gotta be kidding. Three is a bad number. The song goes, ''She died on Three Island.'' 6-1 . It's 6-1 , right? Tell us now. You won. It's 1 -6. 1 -6? It's 1 -6? - This is amazing. - Your gutsy move paid off. When you placed your bet, I got a hunch you might win. I should have followed you. Congratulations. This is an upset. You're sure to win 2,000. I bet on 6-1 , so... I hope things worked out. Don't worry. They're taking the bookie to the cleaners. You sure? Mon Ch?rie! Watch it. Hurry up. I won 340,000. Pay up. - We have a problem. - What is it? I didn't expect such an upset. I don't have the cash. What? You said you had a million or two. That's why I placed such a bet. - You lied to us. - I didn't lie. - You don't have money now? - You only want to take our money? How can we deal with you when you're taking such risks? - Please calm down. - We won't calm down. How can we calm down? Please hear me out. We don't care about your side of the story. - You need to pay him. - Enough talk from you. I agree. Isn't there someone we can talk to? Call your boss. Let us talk to your boss. How about a cup of sake? Why not? I'm Toramatsu, in charge of these boys. They told me what happened. Could you let me save face and let us be? That's asking too much. Of course, I won't send you home empty-handed. Hey. You can pay him some, can't you? Yes. With all the cash on hand, a little more than half his winnings. I?ll come up with the balance soon. Please take what I can offer today. Of course I?ll have him put it in writing. How about that, Mr. Student? Mr. Student? You're obviously a college student. It's written all over your face. To your success. To our success. To your profit. The net profit of 226,200 yen. Now, the accounting report. The phone bill, 4,800 yen. Losses to the bookie, 24,000 yen. Car rental, 1 0,000 yen. Expenses, 75,000 yen. Net profits, 226,200. This is all thanks to Toda's idea. We can quit college and live off the bookies. You got a good boyfriend. - Behind every successful man... - How old-fashioned! My man is a future Robin Hood. - Then I?ll be Sherlock Holmes. - Bravo, anyways. Give us your most expensive Johnny Walker. Tonight, I only accept cash. Will you pay me back? 35,000? Don't be hasty. I only got 200,000. We each won 40,000. First we have to collect the balance. Will they pay up? We won't give up easy. It's our money, no need to be shy. That boss in the middle is a bad sign. We?ll go in a group. Don't do anything dangerous. Until he pays you back 35,000 yen. No more risky business talk. Drink up, billionaire. That's it. Let's drink up and then let's dance. Let's dance and then let's have fun. First. let's dance, dance, dance. You pervert. BAGGAGE AND BICYCLE STORAGE We're not getting anywhere with you. Can we talk to someone in charge? But he's taking the day off. Where is he? Abashiri, Hokkaido. - Liar! - Oki. You don't intend to pay off the balance. I don't know. We can't give you what we don't have. What a way to put it. Shut up. Don't get too cocky. You're too greedy for college kids. Let's go. Just you wait. Bro. Thanks. Silly little college kids. Let's beat them up. They're asking for it. - Sure. - How do we beat them up? We?ll find that man and beat him up. Idiot. What about the money? The money's out of the picture. They don't intend to pay. They sure don't. Toda, can't you use your knowledge of criminal law? No use. We have it in writing, but dealing with bookies is illegal. We can't file a suit. - Soji! - Watch it! - Go away. - Watch it. There are cars on the road. This is Highway Safety Week. You need to watch it. I'm angry. I'm furious. I'm boiling over. - What's boiling? - Not a pot. - Wait. I got an idea. - What is it? He said he didn't have a wife, but he'd put up his sister as collateral. He sure did. That girl who visited the bookie called him ''Brother.'' I see. - We don't know where she is. - We can find out. - Can we get her so easily? - Leave it to me. Few young girls these days refuse when a guy asks them out. Don't be a show-off. You think you're so hot? Let's do that. Let's act like loan sharks to collect the debt. How do we do it? So-chan will ask her out. We?ll nab her when you walk her home. You?ll put up a fight, but it's one against four. We?ll take her. Why make it so complicated? This way, it?ll look like So-chan isn't one of us. Then you can go to the bookie. You can see how he reacts. If he cares for his sister, he?ll pay up. - If he doesn't... - If he doesn't, then? I haven't thought that far. National Children's Art Exhibition is on the seventh floor. Welcome to our store. Welcome to our store. Didn't I see you at your brother's place? - Remember me? - I don't. You do remember. It's all over your face. Please watch your step. Welcome to our store. - Good-bye. - Good night. - See you tomorrow. - Good-bye. Didn't I see you at the escalator? Remember me? I already forgot. I know what that piece of paper said. ''I'm waiting for you at some coffee house at such-and-such a time.'' How do you know? You didn't even read it. On avarage, I get 1 0 notes a day. 1 5 men have the nerve to talk to me. 20 men try to touch my body. If I responded to each, I'd be exhausted and end up in a sanatorium. Aren't you pesky? I'm shocked. I'm stunned. I'm at a loss for words. I'm calling the police. Is it a crime to walk down the street? I pay taxes. Well, my father does. You're wasting your time following me. I love to waste time. A cup of tea, as promised. Thank you for the tea. I'm leaving. That's cold. Five more minutes. Having tea with you was already an excessive show of friendliness. Would you show me more friendliness? Pushy, aren't you? You gotta be pushy to survive in the modern world. Let me walk you home, at least. I don't want a gambling college boy to walk me home. I'm not a gambler. You placed a bet with a bookie. What? You remember that? You said you didn't remember. I didn't forget. You were flushed and excited, all alone amongst the older men. I was surprised to see such a beautiful woman in such a dirty place. That's nice. You're bad. But you're cute, too. Thank you. But you're bad, too. Only a little. - Bad meets bad. Let's hang out. - Too late for that. - How about a movie? - No. - Dinner? - I?ll eat at home. - Dance? - No. I know a place we can go. - Where? - Shut up and come with me. That was so fun. You're just a big talker. You're like a child. I'm surprised. You're strong inside. I've heard that no man wants to marry a girl like me. That's not true. Let's sit down. Please. What can I get you? - Coffee for me. - Okay. And you? Let me see. How about the kid's menu? This is a coffee shop, sir. I know that. - Coffee. - Yes, sir. Wait here for a moment. I have to call home. It was easy. She's just a kid. I put her on a ride and she screamed and held on to me. Really? Didn't you hold on to her? Idiot. What time will you take her home? 8:30. Just as planned. We can't miss the timing. We can wait, but don't have too much fun and forget about us. You can kiss her, but don't be late. Sorry to keep you waiting. Should we go now? Already? What about your coffee? What a good son. You call in. You go home early. Listen to yourself. Earlier, you were like, ''Five more minutes and I have to go.'' Those kids are cute, aren't they? You must have been like them. Tsk, tsk. Don't put me down. You're graduating this year, right? What will you do after school? I?ll work at a trading company. We're in a hiring slump. Things don't work out that way. I know someone at Daiwa Commodities. I can sneak in there. Daiwa is first-rate. That's wonderful. I wish my brother would find a job. You can say that, but... It's just that I don't like what he does. I love him, though. Okay. You're a good son. Let's go. No, don't worry about those bastards. Well, well. Calling your parents ''bastards.'' I got it. I'm paying here. You're dependent on your parents. I make my own money. Don't worry about it. You?ll have to wine and dine me when you land that job. Here they come. - Do you like kids? - Yeah. I love kids. I want 1 0 kids. I only have one brother. I've always wanted more. Japan is overpopulated. Let's have only five. How many siblings have you got? - 1 0. - That's a lot. But not mass-produced and inferior quality. What's wrong? You're funny. You've been going, ''Yeah, yeah.'' What were we talking about? How many older brothers have you got? What? I'm an only child. That's what I thought. You've been joking around. Please be serious with me. You're trembling. Was that your first kiss? I thought you were more experienced. You're surprisingly innocent. - Which would you prefer? - Do you have to ask? You're Matsui's sister. Won't you come with us? - Who the hell are you? - Back off, lover boy. Ouch. Ouch. Somebody help! - Come here. - What are you doing? Let me go. - Let me go! - Be quiet. Someone, please. What the hell... Don't get up. Ouch. Be quiet, you! - Leave me alone. - Be a good girl and get in. Hey, Okitsu! The rest is up to you. Quick! - Soji! - Be still. Soji! Who is it? What do you want? Okitsu, take it off. What do you mean? Don't touch me. - It's a blindfold. - I?ll do it myself. What a strong-willed girl. Don't think badly of us. We don't want to do this. It's only for a short while. Until your brother pays off my winnings. I was going to call the police, but I'd figured you'd want to know first. No need to call the police. I?ll take care of it myself. My mother has a heart condition. Kyoko was late, so she was worried. You should've whispered. Why did you yell? You're so dense. It's your fault. You asked Kyoko out. Mother, I?ll bring her home soon. Don't worry. See, she's having a heart attack. Go get the doctor. Where is the doctor? At Hotta Hospital, in front of the station. Does it hurt? Don't worry. The doctor is coming soon. What are you waiting for? Go ahead. Okay. Let me remind you, it's useless to scream. There's only an old woman house-sitting here. Do you enjoy doing something this stupid? It's not for fun. It's a serious and important business matter. My brother might pay up to rescue me, but you?ll face real fear afterwards. - Trying to scare us? - I'm not. I mean it. Watch it. Your brother's the dirty one, trying to cheat me of my winnings. He probably doesn't have the money. Then he shouldn't be in that business. My brother doesn't like that business. Poor him. You live in a mansion like this. You own a car. You don't need more money. You're wrong. I'm a freeloader and a house sitter. That clunker belongs to a drivers club. We're doing this only because we want him to keep his promise. We?ll treat you like a lady, so act like one. She's a lady now? A phone call. Hello, Toda. How's it going over there? What? I'm stuck here in a ''New Theatre''-style tragedy. Her place is a rundown apartment. Her mother had a heart attack. I had to get a doctor and shaved ice. Tetsutaro's such a slave driver. Be good to other people's parents. As a way of atonement. ls that you, Okitsu? Why did you punch me for real? Got a grudge against me? Is he going to pay? Of course he will. He turned pale when I told him. But you guys better not do anything wrong. If you hurt her, her mother might end up dead. Could it be that you fell for the girl? Idiot. I'm just telling you to be careful, that's all. Besides, Tetsutaro is... She's the money tree. We?ll take care of her. I don't want to repeat myself, but don't show up here. She doesn't suspect you yet. You're bad. Toda, you're the bad one. Idiot. She's gone. She's got to be here. This place is locked up. There's a strange girl in the bathroom. What the hell? Bathroom, huh? Hello. Bro. Where's my sister? Safe and sound. We took her as collateral, as you suggested. Pay up, and she's free. Another 1 40,000. Come up with it soon. You already have it, don't you? I don't. I really don't. Then hit a long shot like I did. Send the money to Suginami Post Office, PO Box Three. Do it soon. Make us wait and I won't be responsible. She's flesh and blood. Only human. Think you can get away with this? That's what your sister said. It's your fault. I don't like that cheap boss that came between us. My schoolmate is the second son of the Takatsuka Family. lf l ask him, they can send a young hotshot. But let's not go down that path. Business is business, right? Lady! Old lady! Old lady! Old lady. Old lady. That's not going to work, young lady. I guess we gotta keep our guard up. That hag is deaf. You'd have to scream in her ears. Let me go. Let me go home. My mother's sick. She could be dying. Please let me go home. I beg you. Help me, Soji. When will we get the balance? The end is in sight. We won't have to wait long. Still, just in case we have to hold out, should we stockpile food and stuff? We can wait for two, three years. Talk about the ''Pot Bottom Recession.'' Not a single customer since this morning. I guess nobody cares for flowers these days. Hey, don't think ill of me. Hello. Do I look good in this? It's my first day as courier. I'm happy for you. I'm already in charge of carrying everybody's salary. Good day. Sorry, I'm borrowing this. Stop, thief! He's a thief! Thief! Stop, thief! Which way? - Come on. - Thanks. After you. Merci. We're home. We're back. We're home. We got treats. We even got whiskey. We got pasta. Kazu, you gotta watch the girl. Let's hide these so the hag won't eat them. AII right. Kazu. Kazu, did you...? - Idiot! - Don't hurt me, Toda. It's gotten out of control. It's you guys' fault. Thank you very much. Sorry for all the trouble. - It's nothing. You brought me all these gifts. How can I thank you? Really, don't say that. Kyoko and Tetsutaro are lucky to have a fine friend like you. You're putting me on the spot. I'm not like that. Please be a good companion to them. Tetsutaro has strayed off like that. If only his father were alive... Didn't the doctor say not to exhaust yourself? So... Where is Kyoko? I only hope she's safe. Mrs. Matsui... I'm sure she?ll come home safe and sound. How do you know? I just have a hunch. And I?ll do my best to find her. Maybe I can find her. No need for that. I came up with the money. I sent it to where they wanted it. Kyoko will be back home as early as tomorrow. Anyway, you. I finally remember where I saw you. You were at our place. - No, I'm not like that. - Tetsutaro, you mustn't... Stay out of this, Mother. Kyoko disappeared because of you. A gambling college kid has no business asking her out. I just wanted to - Don't say that. He's been very kind. I don't want his kindness. I hate college kids like you. You live off your rich, fat parents. I get angry just looking at you. I don't even wanna see this. Tetsutaro. Mother, take care of yourself. Excuse me. Who are you? I'm with the police. Tetsutaro's not around? Did he do anything? He attacked a factory money courier and stole 1 50,000 in cash. Notify us at the station when Tetsutaro comes back. Got it? No, you mustn't get up. It can't betrue. It must be a mistake. I'm bringing back Kyoko. Please rest and wait for me. Showdown. What you got? I win again. Three aces. Hey, the girl's mother has keeled over. I?ll be responsible for the money. Release the girl. You gotta be kidding. Old people are meant to die. We can't make a living if we show mercy. Flush your humanity down the toilet. Bastards. I know he's sent the money. How can you be sure. l heard Tetsutaro. Fool. You can't trust him. The police are searching for him. He attacked a courier and stole the money. Robbery? Are you sure? lf we don't release her soon, things could get bad for us. Thank goodness, Toda. Just when we needed you. Answer me. What's going on? This is bad. If Tetsutaro gets popped, we might end up in jail as well. That's not good. I can't do that. But they don't know anything about the trick. They only know what Toda looks like. We can't let her go before we get the money. That's true. There's no need for panic. I don't want to lose her yet. She was like, ''No, no, help me, Soji.'' Is she in love with So-chan? It's no time to be joking around. Kidnapping. Rape. Blackmail. We'd better release her before things get complicated. I can't go to the clink. What about the money? Let's trust Soji about the money. We're still in college. We can't take risks. But...what about the money? That would be... Let's think about it later. What are you guys mumbling? Answer me. Shut up. Stay quiet. So it's settled. We?ll let the girl go. I'm closing up now. If you need a phone, there's one at the cigar shop over there. - Thank you for your patience. - We're here now. Sorry for the trouble. Kazu. Kyoko. So-chan. Kyoko, your mother is sick. You tricked me. I was deceived. So-chan, get in the car. Something happened, right? I don't know anything. Me neither. So-chan, we shouldn't have let on that you were one of us. How come? She was in love with you. Get in. What's done is done. We can't stay here. Mother. Mother. No, I haven't seen him. Hey, Kyosuke. Didn't you see him? - See who? Tetsutaro, of the Matsui Family. He bought some pork last night. He was going to make a pork rice bowl. When was it? It was about 6:00. Oh no, it was the night before. What are you talking about? - Hey. - Did Tesutaro do something? Boss, can I go take a look? Idiot. - Let's go see. - Yes, sir. Look. The cops showed up this morning. I was surprised. She was an active and nice girl. Like they say, the fairest flowers fade soonest. This is so sad. Why did she kill herself? What happened? The department store girl killed herself. She took some poison. Side by side with her mother. Poor girl. They're going to perform an autopsy. They?ll cut her open. What do we do now? What about it? We're in at the deep end. Return the money to the courier Tetsutaro allegedly attacked? Who cares. Let's divide it up. He's right. Play innocent. Act like you don't know anything. Tetsutaro can say anything, but he can't prove you got the money. There's some truth to that. Besides, he's an illegal bookie. I can't imagine he'd talk to the police and incriminate his buddies. - I see. - Impressive, Mr. and Mrs. Toda. Don't flatter us. Then let's not waste a moment. I'm taking my share. - Me too. - Me too. Still not enough. See, women are the greediest. Look, lover boy is back. What an ungrateful boy. Where have you been? What's wrong? You're pale. Kyoko committed suicide. By now, she's on an autopsy table next to her mother. She was strong. She wouldn't kill herself just because her mother died. Something happened. Tell me. I don't know anything. I know nothing. I don't know what I don't know. You're lying! You're hiding something from me. I know it. Tell me. Please tell me. So-chan. Were you in love with her? No... I wasn't. It's all right, then. Nothing we can do about what's been done. I'm sorry for her. Then, Toda... Something did happen. I see. Now I see. - You raped Kyoko. - I didn't. Either way, it's the same. The same? What's the same? - So-chan, you're responsible, too. - That's absurd. I just liked her. It was your idea to hold her hostage. And she ended up falling in love with you. You can't separate this from the bicycle race scam. We can't blame each other. We're all in this together. Yes, we are. We're all co-conspirators. Why so indignant? Are you a model student? I know. That's why I can't forgive myself. Hold on. Don't get excited. No one could have guessed it would end up like this. No one could have guessed? But we did it. I told you I didn't do it. Then why didn't you stop them? You can't evade responsibility like that. Your excuse is you didn't do it yourself. Smart people like you always say that. That's cowardly. Toda, you're a coward. So-chan, are you saying you're the only one who's not? Hey, don't get too full of yourself. Don't think about it so much. After all, we got the money, safe and sound. - Don't complain. Take it. - I don't want it. I don't want the money. So-chan. It's over. Whatever happened, take the money. I don't want it. Toda, I don't know how to say it. No, I don't want this money. If you don't want it, I?ll take it. Toda, I'm no longer in your group. Stupid asshole. Toda, now each of us has a bigger share. Toda, I have a few last words for you. Watch out for Tetsutaro. Unlike you, he's a serious man. Things must have gone to his head. He suddenly got complicated. Maybe it's love? I think I know what So-chan is feeling. Idiot, you bitch! No way a woman can understand this. Let's switch to a happy tune. SEVERAL DAYS LATER MAN STABS STUDENT AND SURRENDERS REVENGE FOR SISTER'S DEATH? ROBBERY SUSPECT ARRESTED A FEW MORE DAYS LATER Number 63, Mr. Soji Oki. Mr. Oki, where are you? Please respond right away. - You're Mr. Oki. - Yes. Why do you want to work for our company? Well, I am... The son of Mr. Oki, with Fuji Trading. I see. Sorry about that. He called me about you, but I haven't seen him in a while. How is he? My father is my father. I'm me. That's true. Your father told me so much about you. - Please ask a real question. - Okay. What's your passion? Have you put your youthful energy to good use? Well, we all persue different things. Some pour their energy into schoolwork. Others are passionate about sports. I'm asking about you. In my case... A girlfriend? Nothing wrong with it. Young people always fall in love. I had one. I like that. You're honest. There's no doubt you?ll be working with us. Use your passion for the good of this company. So-can. Excuse us. So-chan, still angry at us? Angry? What's the point? Why don't you answer then? What do you want? - Did you hear Tetsutaro confessed? - I read the newspaper. Weren't you worried he'd expose us? I was so scared he'd say we were in cahoots with Toda, I couldn't eat. So I asked Mr. Hayashi at Japan News to look into it. He's an editor. This man. It sound like he didn't say a word about us. He blamed Toda alone for blackmailing him and kidnapping his sister. He confessed to stabbing him to avenge his sister. We were spared. We could've ended up in jail. It was a close call. We're lucky. At best, we'd have been expelled from school. I don't mind leaving school, but it would've hurt my job hunting. Speaking of job hunting, I need a favor. Kazu had an ''in'' with a sugar company VP, but he dropped dead two nights ago. His ''in'' went out the window. Please have your father find me a job. Somewhere. Anywhere. Please. Hey, So-chan, aren't you happy? We brought you such good news. Smile and do me a favor. We survived areal close shave. I see. I'm happy for you. Thank you. Merci. Good for you. Really, good for you. Thank heavens. He's calling his father already. So-chan is our friend after all. But you know what? He is not. Hello. Is this Mr. Hayashi? Mr. Hayashi, you're an editor at Japan News? I have some information for you. It's about the student murder at the Tokyo Academy University. There are four students involved. They're accomplices. I?ll give you their names. Please write them down. Ichiro Akitani, senior, economics. Hiroshi Okitsu, Kazu Tomita. And Soji Oki. Don't forget about Soji Oki. THE END
