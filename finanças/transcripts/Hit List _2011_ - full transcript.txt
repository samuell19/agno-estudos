Help! To understand how I found myself in the trunk of this car, you have to back to my childhood. That's pretty Michael. It is a butterfly. Very nice. Isn't that beautiful Hilary. It's a pine tree. Lovely. That's... interesting, Charlotte. It's a pride of lions ripping the intestines out of a wildebeest. From an early age I had issues with hostility. Charlotte, what do you see? A bald eagle shot in the head with an arrow. Okay. What do you see now? A condemned killer in an electric chair. Charlotte, clearly we have some things to work on. Okay, tell me about the dream. I'm swimming with a family of pythons. Except each one of them is speaking Latin. And they keep trying to tell me that they wanna... The river that we are swimming on is covered with these... these jelly donuts. But... But I can't understand them because I don't speak Latin. So I'm thinking, he's going to love this jelly donut. I reach out, I open his mouth, I shove it down his throat... And... He swallows it, and he dies! And then, I wake up. You're making this shit up. My therapist suggested that I keep a journal. But, my lack of writing ability didn't make it too productive. I love the smell of napalm in the morning! The baked beans are five for two ninety nine! The creamed corn is six for three ninety nine! And the broccoli is three for one ninety nine! But only until Wednesday! Dust every can thoroughly. And make sure that all of the labels are clean and visible.. Wait!, uh... How much is the creamed corn again? Oh swell, another brain surgeon. Just read... the price-chart, Dolly! Yes, Mister Button. And if you're the one who's been stealing the cinnamon coffee cake... I'll sling your boney ass! Yes... Mister Button. That's when it hit me! The true purpose for my journal. "People... I wish... were dead" Number one: Mister... Button! It really did help with my hostility. So, that was sex? Shut up! I'm watching "The Real World of Duluth." Number two: Scott... How do you spell your last name? I said, shut up! In college I met my first love: Chad. What's your name, sweet ass? Charlotte. - I'm good. - I'm good. You're okay? -I'm great, yeah. Initially, the attraction was purely physical. Yeah! Open the jam. Honey, did you finish Philosophy essay? Oh yeah. What about my Econ take home? Right here. Nice! Well then I'm done. Sweet. Thanks for doing that. You are welcome. -Love you. Love you too. After college we moved in together. Honey, I needed a place to hang my jersey, so... I took down the portrait of your family. You don't mind, do you? No honey, that's fine. Chad pursued his dream of becoming an actor. Pyramix Spray, it soothes that burning sting of jock itch. Great. Now say it like your balls are dipped in sulfuric acid. And I supported him. Damn it! Son of a bitch! Global Talent Agency, Mr. Welle's office Damn it, Charlene! This latte is completely foam! please hold. Uh... It's Charlotte Mister Weller. Now, am I on heroin, or did I not specifically ask you to significantly reduce the amount of foam. Yes, Mister Weller. How can I be expected to operate effectively when I'm surrounded by incompetence? Hello... Hello? Number... three. Did you pay the rent today, honey? Yes, honey. Did you buy me some of that raspberry pineapple sherbet? Honey? Yes, honey. Well, can I have some please?...Honey. Yes, honey. Thank you. What? Here you go. -Thanks baby. Love ya. Love you too. These chicks are crazy. Until Chad got his big break So, how'd it go? So... I got it! Oh my God! Can you believe it? Right? Doctor Blade Shamrock He was Doctor Blade Shamrock on "The Beautiful and the Vain". Mrs. Pontingfrench? Yes. I'm afraid your son has Hyper Tyfectimone syndrome. It's a rare neurological virus that causes the patient's gender to change Well, what can I do? Well, I could consider buying him a new wardrobe. I'm truly sorry. Hang in there. Ha? What'd you think? Honey, I'm so proud of you. Oh, thanks babe. Love you. Love you too. Oh, that is good. I think I'll have another for the good doctor. Oh yeah. Soon followed the axe Charlotte... When two trees are growing side by side. Often times their roots will, you know... strangle each other. And in order to save those trees... sometimes park rangers will up root them and move them to separate parts of the forest. Now, I think... that you and I could use some time to grow our roots. In separate parts of the forest. Number four... You know what I'm saying? Here you go! Ohh... Enjoy your meal! Can't stop us from having a nice dinner, though. Hang on Charlotte And here comes Chad Peterson. Up this year for his first daytime soap nomination... as Blade Shamrock on "The Young and the Vain." Accompanying Chad is his live in girlfriend the ravishing super model; Vasheka. Vasheka? That's not a name it's an STD. Rumor has it they're talking marriage. Mrs. Sheehan! Would you please shut that little hair ball up? Before I put it through my blender and use it as chum for attracting sharks! Oh my Lord! Don't worry Froot Loops Don't let the angry, lonely, angry lady, whose hot boyfriend just dumped her... because he was so far out of her league, scare you, sweetheart! Hah. Ew.. ahh! Ah.. What'cha got here? "Casablanca"... "Love Story", "When Harry met Sally" If your life were a film, would it be titled, "Romantic Witness"? Just give me the DVD's... Wick. Hmmm... What?...wow! What? I think you qualify for our frequent flier program. Seventy five rentals in one week. And you get to own your own franchise!...ha Naw. Enjoy. Do you smell poop? I smell poopy. In other news there was a six point five earthquake centered today in Hollywood. And now, on to the weather. Well, hidy-ho and a hello out there in toyland, folks. Our wild, wacky, one day forecast calls for out Southern California weather... to drop a whopping two degrees, from eighty four to eighty two. Brrr... Back to you, toots. It's Carlee. He is such a cheese ball... Right? When it's right, you just know it. Forever. Forever. Huh. Do you remember my friend Karen Anderson's daughter, Angie? Huh... Yes? She just had her... third child! And she is two years younger than you. Umm... Must you catalog your friend's children's fetuses? I'm just staring down the gun barrel of a grandchild-less old age. I'm dating! Back off. Really? Um-hmm. Online. -what? Are you in the market for some guy who looks like Danny Devito... who lives in his car and eats human flesh? Way to keep an open mind, mom. Honey, do you have mace? -No. Pepper spray? -No. Wha... A Taser Gun? -Mother! My first Internet date... wasn't all I'd hoped for. Oh I need it! there you go. Oh!, Mom, loves sushi. No, I don't. She talks about it all the time. They can make the ultimate compact car, but they can't cook their fish. She's always trying to eat healthy. Riddled with parasites. She's never really one to turn down something new, you know. I keep looking for a hook. She's my mom. That's right dear. Thank you. You know I still feel so gosh darn lucky, you know... 'Cause she's my best friend and... Oh!, last week we went camping And she had the time of her life. Lost a pint of blood to mosquitoes and fell off a cliff. How many guys do you know who can go camping with their mom? Not many. Came within inches of being a paraplegic. I would have to say that hanging out with my mom is my favorite thing to do. Totally! We just love each other's company. You know? The rash on my thigh is incurable. The second date was an equal disappointment. Yeee-Haw! Whoo! That is right, baby!, Whoo! How you like Billy Jean? Who? My truck. I named her Billy Jean. Ah... Very big, I suppose for this road, which is... very small! Oh, Billy Jean can handle any road. She is strong, yet sleek, Powerful, yet sensitive. Oh... watch this! Whoo-Haah! Whoo!! Yeah! Do you have any Dramamine? No, why? I was just about to retire from Internet dating when Lyle showed up. Charlotte? Yes? I'm Lyle Wilkes. Yeah? Not possible. Pardon me? This is a hidden camera show, right? I mean, after I look all happy to meet you and you leave... So the real Lyle Wilkes can show up and he's my fat, drooling junior high wood shop teacher. No hidden camera. No wood shop. Charlotte Murphy. Nice to meet you. Likewise. May I sit? Please. So what do you do, Charlotte? Umm, I'm an assistant to a talent agent. How about you? Independent contractor. Oh. Your table's ready. I don't want to eat here. What? Let's go someplace else. But, you made the reservation. Suddenly I have a better idea. Ummm... Do you eat human flesh? Only when I drink Tequila. Come on. We'll be going elsewhere. Did you know that, ah.. tacos... were originally invented for horse meat? No, oddly enough I did not know that. In the eighteen hundreds, the Mexican army used to eat horse meat with every meal. So I guess after a while it got a little boring, so they invented the taco, to jazz things up. If they were eating their horses, what would the ride into battle? Why do you think they lost Texas? Do you like the Huggable Beaver? Is that a sex question? The cartoon: Bilgy, "The Huggable Beaver." Oh my God! I love Bilgy! I thought I was the only person over ten who did. I did it. What? I met my primary life goal. I found a beautiful woman who loves the Huggable Beaver as much as I do. I don't know about the beautiful part, but... I am undoubtedly all about the Huggable Beaver. - Wow, that came out wrong! - That came out perfect. Back to the grind. That month, we saw each other almost every day. We went to foreign films. So, what did the duck mean? I have no idea. Hey, what about that naked old guy on the trapeze? What was that all about? That one got by me too. We went to coffee houses. It's all the seer seeing, but a dream, but a dream. It's good. Mmm... Mine too. This place is great. Isn't it? This place sucks. -Completely! What is this? This is coffee my parents had this every morning. Goat cheese and caffeine what a combo! Let's go grab a beer. I heard that! And we went hiking! Beautiful day. -Oh! -What? This bush!...it made a rattling sound. Yeah, you are right. You probably don't wanna get near that bush, alright? Let's go over here. You're fine It's not gonna get you as long you don't jump on it. Let's go. We meshed. Don't worry Fruit Loops... they are going to Hell on a jet rocket. Ooh... these kids! Wow! I think I'm going to faint. It's a good thing you're lying down. So, ahh, what's that motion thing you were doing with your hips? Maori Indian mating ritual. Oh. I saw it on National Geographic. I love National Geographic. I'm a lifetime subscriber. Lucky for me. Hey. -Yeah? I got you something. Oh, my God. Our pal, Bilgy. What... but... It's not my birthday! I know, but I just saw it, and it made me think of you. Oh, my God! But... But.. I didn't... get you anything. So, get me something later. Thank you! I love it! I love it, thank you! -You're welcome. So... I'm glad to see you're not a meatloaf. Actually, I met someone who's... pretty okay. Really? Uh-hmm Does he live in his car? Mom... noo! Does he look like Danny Devito? Ahh... not in the least! Oh... So... When do your father and I get to meet him? Ah... When monkeys colonize Mars. Okay. I'm just gonna go to work, okay? I'll be back tonight. I'll miss you. Hey there. You gonna answer that? Wilkes Contracting. Hi, it's me. Hey, it's good to hear your voice. What are you doing? Ahh! Going on the tread mill. Oh. Is this a bad time? Not at all! Who ever is paying you! I'll double it!! What was that? Just the TV. So... I was thinking about you. So I thought I'd give you a call. Oh, I'm glad you did. Really? Absolutely. I was hoping you'd say that. Why wouldn't I? I don't know, I thought I might be bugging you. Weller's coming! Umm... I have to put you on hold. Okay! Hey, are you still there? Yeah! I'm still here. Wow, you're really getting a workout, huh? Augh! Nothing as important as cardio! Augh! You really keep that TV loud. Oh shit, I gotta go! Ahh hmm. Are you sure? Ah yeah, I'll see you later tonight, okay? Augh! Ahh! Aahh!! Augh! Ahh! Charlotte? Yeah? I love you. Huh? I love you too. Aahhh! I gotta go!...Bye. Wilkes Contracting. It's me again. Are you busy? No, I'm not at all. I just got off the treadmill. So... when you said love, did you mean "love," "love"? Or just love? I'm not sure I understand the question. What I mean is, when you said, "I love you." Did you say it because was like a great way to end a phone conversation? Or because you really, genuinely, for sure, love me? What are you waiting for? - Well, why did you say it? - Hey! I asked you first. Charleen!!? Well, uh... I said it because I genuinely love you. And I want to spend my foreseeable future with you. Get your ass over here! Or you'll be slinging on whores dot com. Gotta go!...Bye. Hello? Charlotte? Come on, lover boy! Hello? You don't have the guts!! Right away! Wilkes contracting. Am I bugging you yet? Hey, I was hoping you would call back. Ahh, Sorry it took me so long. My boss is... my boss. You're not busy, are you? No, I'm just tying up some loose ends. Listen, I'm sorry I left you hanging. It's just... I guess I got a little scared when you said all those things. That's understandable. It's just a little soon for me. Maybe I'm rushing things a little bit. No!...I'm not saying I didn't like what you said... I did, and I'm not saying I don't, maybe, feel the same way. Look, I don't want you to feel obligated to say anything back to me. I just don't want you to interpret it as a lack of interest. Or a lack of necessarily feelings, in any way... I don't want you to think that at all! Augh! I gotta go. Bye. Who said I didn't have the guts. So... So? Not happening, Dude! What? I am not bringing Lyle over the house for dinner. No way! no how! Come on now. He is going to meet us eventually. I mean, especially if you are getting serious about him. I told him I'm an orphan. Alright. Okay, now... what can I do to make it worth your while? Vote Democrat in every election for the rest of your life... Donate two percent of your net worth to Green Peace... and, uhh... pay my cell phone bill for the next five years! What? That is a monstrous asking price!! Always negotiate from a position of strength. Done! How's the roast chicken, Lyle? Excellent, Mister Murphy! Umm..would you like some more potatoes, Lyle? Yes, please. You know, there's no butter in them... Everybody thinks my potatoes are loaded with butter, But they're not! No, no, no! I'm sure Lyle doesn't need to know your secrets for roasting potatoes, mom. And what are you scared of? Yet another boyfriend dumps you because your mother doesn't use butter. Okay, enough! I'm sorry. Lyle, Charlotte tells me that you are... an independent contractor. That's right. Well, good work. I think last summer you had a job with a construction crew... Travis. He quit after two days. Because there were callouses on his fingers. You can't be Kurt Cobain with callouses! Who the fuck is Kurt Cobain? He's dead. He's dead!? What good are you when you're dead? Now he lives in my basement. I'm just following my dreams, pops! Don't call me, "Pops". How many times have I asked you now to do that? And the next time you do that, I'm going to kick your scrawny ass... right outside. Touchy! Travis... Don't! Don't. Pops. Oh, Travis! Umm... Ah... More... more potatoes, Lyle? Yes, please. Yes, it's hard to believe there's no butter in these, isn't it? You should sell the recipe to a restaurant. Oh!...no... I saw Chad on TV, Charlotte. Shut up, Travis. Not a bad actor, really. Shut up, Travis!! You two please, just take it easy, okay? Dad! I understand. Acid reflux. Would you like some more roasted chicken, Lyle? Absolutely. Spuds, Sis? Didn't I tell you that online dating was a great idea? Actually, you said I'll most likely wind up with a cannibal. Lyle is the complete package. Pretty much. You should have dated online years ago! You're so right. And he seems so... serious about his work. Yeah... He doesn't talk about it much, but I know he works really hard. Well, don't pry! Men do not like it when women pry. Good tip, Laura Bush. How is he in bed? Uhh... That question, coming from you... is utterly horrifying on more levels than I can begin to count. A pal for Bilgy! Oh my God... Oh my God! You're unbelievable. You're unbelievable! God! You're not going to work today, Lyle? I'm taking the morning off. It's the benefits of self employment. Okay. Make sure you lock both locks when you leave, okay? Got it. Bye. See you tonight. Bye. Charlotte! Come on Fruit Loops, let's go for our morning poo-poo. Charlotte! -Ohh! Good God! I'm sorry. Don't worry baby! It is just the angry lady's anonymous, disease ridden sex partner. Charlotte! You forgot your purse. Mister Philips! Mister Button. Mister Gutherie, your three o'clock is there. Hi! Mister Borders? Mister Gutherie. -Please, call me Scott. Scott. -So, looking to buy a house today? Oh, Mister Weller? I didn't have anything in your book for lunch today. Yeah, that's right. I don't care if I'm your step brother! I love you like no man could ever love a non-blood relative. I understand you can cut my produce prices in half. I guarantee it. Guarantee, huh? Hey! Get back to the cabbage, you half brained dimwit! I'll sling your boney ass! Besieged by incompetence. I know what you mean. So, getting back to my produce crisis. I think you could come down to my facility and check it out for yourself. Great. -All right. Yes sir. Well, you came to the right place. After you. No, no, no! After you. Thank you. So? -So, did you want me to put something? Charleen, Charleen, Charleen! My meetings are too important to be constantly checking in with you like some dim-witted den mother. It's Charlotte, Mister Weller. I don't care! I happen to have a very important lunch meeting... and I chose not to tell you. Park it where I can see it, Jose. The name's Jimmy, pendejo! Mister Harris. Mister Weller. I can't tell you how excited I am... to have someone of your reputation interested in this project. I think it could be big. Very nice tie. And I will be the father to your child despite his massive deformities. I want to be with you... in all four seasons. Sorry, it's from my soap. It's all I really had time to prepare. No, no... It was..great. Oh, well thank you. You know, I really haven't done much theater. You know in fact, I haven't done any theater. But I know it could help my career. I just wanna be taken seriously as an actor. I'm ready to give you the part. Re.. Really? Oh my God! Ah... thank you. You won't regret it! I'm sure you're right! Lyle was spending a lot of time at work and I was about to comfront him about it.. When he came home with tickets to Cabo. How's your Spanish? Earlier today, super model Vasheka gave this heartbreaking interview. Chad, if you can her me I'm sorry that I called you a no talent, pretty boy trained chimp, who sounds like chipmunk. You're the only one for me. Please come back. Charlotte? Yes, Mister Ward? I want to start off by saying how happy I am to be replacing Mister Weller, and to have you as my assistant. Thank you Mister Ward. Call me Josh. I was going to get myself a mineral water. Would you like one? Oh, yes please, Mister Ward. Josh. Right, Josh. Chad was reportedly doing Dinner Theater in Saint Petersburg Thank you doctor-The good doctor will be right with you. Okay. The new guy playing Doctor Blade Shamrock was a shoe in for this year's daytime award. Monica, I'm afraid you are never going to walk again. But Doctor Shamrock, you said it was just a head cold. Sadly no. You have Kiwi disease. It's a rare neurological virus that tricks you brain into thinking that your legs are useless. And that you're from New Zealand. Ohh..I'll have to abandon my dream of dancing for the Bolshoi Ballet. And I'll adopt a really annoying accent. The Dingo ate me baby! Come on Fruit Loops... Come on little boy. How was work today? I made a killing. Hidy ho, and a hello out there in toyland, folks. An actual rain drop was felt today in Van Nuys. Better call out the National Guard. What a cheese ball. Come on, sweetheart. Aaah! Mrs. Sheehan. Consider this your last warning. If you don't properly train that little menace to shut its fur ball ass up. I will feel completely justified in feeding it to my cousin's boa constrictor! My God! ohh... Don't worry Fruit Loops... The unstable prostitute will never feed you to a boa constrictor. My little baby. You what? Aah! Aah!! Get lost. Number... five. Fruit Loops! Rat, weasel, greasy ball of shit! Ha ha ha! How do you like me now bitch? Is everything alright? Umm-hm. Hidy ho, diddly do, it is rain, rain, rain. Better keep those Bar-B-Q's inside, ladies and germs... Because as my mama used to say... "You can't go out in the rain with out getting wet." What the hell...? Number Six! What's that guy's name again? Umm.. Billy Joe... something. Hey pooch Want a biscuit? Two points. I'm like talking Ferrari. Excuse me, but umm... didn't I see you two in the Hawaiian Tropic bikini contest?..in Maui? I'm Billy Joe Philbin. I do the weather on channel eight. You've seen me. Can you believe this guy? Are you and I going to sleep with him, or just bolt? Let's get out of here. What a cheese ball! Fat old cheese ball. - Dykes! - Hi, a Harvey on the rocks please. Thanks. Hi there. Hello. Did you ever dated a weather man? Say... didn't I see you in the Hawaiian Tropic Bikini Competition in Maui? Excuse me little lady... But ah... didn't I see you in the Hawaiian Tropic Bikini Competition in Maui? Aren't you Billy Joe Philbin? That's right. My wife and I watch you every night. Oh! thanks. Thanks a lot. Have you ever acted in movies? No, but..uh, I've been asked. I run a small production company and we have a role coming up... that I think would be perfect for you! Really? Look, if you're interested... give me a call. Alright, ah..thanks! Thanks a lot! Hopefully I'll see you soon. -Yeah. You said sixty percent chance of rain... Clear as a bell. Lyle and I decided it was time to cohabitate. Can I be part of the family? Oh my God. Oh my God! Thank you. Lyle, dinner's ready! I'll be right there! So, when am I going to be able to see your brother's band play? Ha ha ha! Yeah, right. Do these potatoes have any butter in them? Because they are good. Hey! They are good. Hey! They are good. It's a family recipe here. Have you ever wondered what the world would be like... if all the meat eating animals ate vegetables and all the vegetable-eating animals ate meat? No, I've never wondered that. Well, think about it. Everybody would be running from wild blood thirsty cows. And from savage saber tooth horses. You couldn't walk out of the front door because of all the carnivorous chipmunks and squirrels. It would be complete bedlam. I tend to worry about really weird things. Like, getting hit by a bus. Or getting caught on the freeway in a nine point 0 earthquake. That'll never happen. You know that inversion layer we were talking about the other day is actually going to pass over us... but that's still going to mean that we are going to have... very calmed subtle temperatures... This new guy is so much better. I miss the old one. It's quieter since that canine rat ran away. Yeah. Yeah. Our lives became fairly pedestrian: During the day I would go to my job... and Lyle would go to his. The nights, we spent together. Hey, Lyle? -Yeah. What's that? -What's what? It looks like blood. Where? Yeah, right there, behind your ear. Huh. Did you cut yourself? I don't think so... You know what? It is probably from that mosquito that I swatted. I'll go wash it off. Hey... -Yeah? Not now. -Not now? Okay, here we are. Hey, Lyle? Yeah? Who is that? Oh, that's a guy I work with. He's trying to be an actor. Really? Does he think you can help him? No, no... he was just giving us all a copy of his head shot. It was actually kind of a joke. Come on, let's eat. You're gonna love this place. Oh, Godfather Three. Is that the one where the dumb son gets drowned in the lake? That's number two. Oh, is that the one where the fat guy gets a knife through his hand? One. I don't remember three. They pulled me back in! Oh yeah! No. -No? -hu-humm Okay. Alien three. There's too many bald people in that. Thelma and Louise. Umm.. too chick. Too...? okay! Terminator! Perfect!...Come on. Thanks a lot. Have them back Wednesday. Oh, thank God. We can stay in business. Hi ya, Wick. I see somebody discovered stud service dot com. Chop chop, dick. I mean, Wick. Oh... I am so sorry. I am squandering your valuable time, eye locked to the idiot tube. How can I atone? How? Terminator. Someone's got a well of unused testosterone. Just give us the DVD, friend. Friend? You know, I love the smell of re-channeled homosexuality. Are you picturing me in a mini skirt? You are aren't you. Huh? Did I shave? You want to know, don't you? That's it! I was nice before, but no more. You've made the grade now, buddy. Number seven. Oh, I'm number one. Wick. Smart ass... little video store pissant You got fangs. That ought to do it. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'll see you soon. Next! You love popcorn and stuff? I love pop corn! I do too! Jesus! that douche! He always takes my space! That's my space! Number eight... the owner.. Of this piece... of shit... car. Hah! Why don't you just park out front? Fine. Whoa! What the hell?! Hey ass wipe! Move it! Me? Sorry. One word: deodorant... Ahh! Uhh, Jeez! And stay tuned for eye witness news at 6PM tonight when we have an exclusive interview with the first man to eve give birth to twins. And now onto the weather with Craig. Craig? Thank you, Carlee. Carlee, you know that low pressure system we were talking about earlier today is actually going to be out by the end of the morning. A hundred percent better. Which is going to give us a beautiful afternoon. And all know, a beautiful afternoon means you have to do something challenging, something rewarding. So how about if you and I go sky diving? Well, that would be wonderful, Craig. I am off at noon, so... How about if we bungee jump out of the plane while we're sky diving? It could have been yours, Chad. And you know what, I did some research and your name, Carlee in English means Petite and womanly... But in my culture, in my culture your name actually stands for the cherry blossoms are blooming. Oh wow. Thanks, Craig. Ties to organized crime? Presumed dead. Lyle, who's that? Oh, that's a guy I work with. He's trying to be an actor. Fruit Loops!? Where's my little poo-poo? Come here boy! Fruit Loops, where are you?! Oh, God... last night he was on my death list. This morning... he is dead. Only once in my life had I received this kind of a shock... What do you think about Kenny Wales? Charlotte... Yeah? Would you kiss me... with tongue? Charlotte? So, I don't understand. He worked here for like..sixteen years. Where is he? - I... I don't know. - So you don't talk to him? No... No one has seen or heard a thing from him. Really? -Yeah! His wife... said he had gambling debts. To tell you the truth, it's been a lot calmer around here since he's left. Thank you. He completely disappeared! He didn't say anything to anybody Management found out he was stealing the office supplies. Oh sweety, you are better off without him. You know what makes me feel better when I'm upset? A new house. This one just opened on the market. Do you want to call me? Never talked about his work. He never invited me to his office. I bought him stuffed animals, and he made my journal come true. So your boyfriend killed all of these people... After you said you wanted to kill them. No! I didn't want to kill them. Look, I was angry and I have issues with hostility. So my psychologist suggested that I write a journal. And then all these things started... Did you tell your boyfriend that you wanted to kill them? No!! I didn't wanna kill them! Look! I think he is a hit man. And he thought he was doing me some sort of favor. Ohh... A hit man? I'm pretty sure killed that volleyball promoter guy. And why would you think that? Because he had a picture of him in his car. And! He never talks about his work. And I've never been to his office. And he's even got Wick's body in his trunk!! Wick? Wick? Uh!...Number seven! Let's go!! If we don't go we'll never get rid of her. We're here. Alright, show us. You'll see. Ha! Uhh!...He's gone! Wick... Wick's gone! I'm guessing you're a fan of hallucinogenic drugs. There was a dead video store employee in that trunk!! If you say so, sweetheart. It was on twitter. Let's get out of here! So we're thinking of having a 4th of July picnic and you should bring Lyle. Mom... When is Lyle's birthday? 'Cause your father and I wanna get him something Mom! Like a leather jacket, hiking boots, nothing too over... Lyle... is a killer. Ha ha!, Like a lady killer? No, like a... killer, killer! Honey, I'm not following. He... murders people! Professionally. Still lost here. My boyfriend is a hit man!! Oh my God! Umm... She's joking. Umm.. Really. You're so funny! Wh... What? A hit man!!? Independent Contractor? It's a code! he's... Jason Bourne! Oh! Well! Honey, you know sometimes you have to take the good with the bad. Excuse me? When you father and I were first married. He used to like to put a cucumber in his underwear. What?! -I know! I used to hate it, but... you know, I loved him! So I got used to it. Ok, umm... As frightening as the visual of Dad with a cucumber in his underwear is... and I am certain I will never be able to fully get that out of my head... How is that in the least bit relevant to the fact that the man I'm living with... is a mass murderer!!! Honey, because true love requires sacrifice. I've died and gone to Hell. Oh, honey... Oh! your hair looks nice today! The only solution was to catch Lyle myself. How was your day, Lyle? Oh, not so special. Poured a couple of foundation, committed a couple of homicides. Oh, and I closed a sale on that twelve unit condominium complex. Run that one by me again!...? So how is your friend's acting going? Huh? Your friend, whose... head, I mean head shot! I found in the back of your car. Oh, him! Dave. Dave? Yeah, Dave. How's his acting? He gave it up. He's now counseling runaways teenagers in Myanmar. Myanmar? -Yeah! Apparently the teenage runaway problem there is quite rampant. Huh! So... I was thinking you might try help Mrs. Sheehan find her dog. That would be neighborly. What do you think could have happened to him? Little critter like that, he could crawled under the heater and suffocated. So he's dead? Could be living in a dumpster, feeding on slow moving insects. Hmm.. Ha, ha. This is good, Honey. Very good. Yummy. Where are you going Lyle? Is that where you get your guns? Ah! Is that where you find your next target? What do you get in there? Ice cream!? Keep your pants on! No! get out of the way! Get, get, out of the way! Shit! Hey! -Ahhhh! Hi! Hi! Ahh... What are you doing here? Uhh... Picking up my bosses's cleaning. He gets his dry cleaning done all the way down here? Oh yeah!...He loves this place! Hmm... Haa.. What's with the video camera? Ah, this? Oh, he likes me to video tape... the cleaners! To make sure they don't switch up his clothes! He's really paranoid about it. I guess so. I hate this singer. Really? Well! not hate, hate... It's not a personal thing. It's just, I don't really care for his music. It's not like I would put him in my journal, or anything! Ah.. Okay. Hey! This is a legal parking space. Ahh... No, no. No. Yeah, I am in the way. You're right, my bad!! Did your boss get his cleaning? What? Your boss, did he get his cleaning? Oh, yeah. He did, thank you. And the video? Oh yeah, he got that too. Over demanding bosses... sometimes you just want to shoot them in the head, and bury them in a ditch. Your mother called. Oh yeah? -Yeah. Said your brother was missing. My brother? Yeah. And then she called right back and said he was just out with his band. Ohh... Yeah, he's a, wild man. Charlotte? Yeah? I think it's time I come clean. About what? Everything. What is it, Lyle? It's big. You can tell me. Will you marry me? Will you be my wife? Ahh... I love you. I know you love me. Ahh... Be my wife, Charlotte. No. No? No. No? You're not going to kill me, are you? It's an option. We can't get married, Lyle. We're totally different. You kill people. I just hate them. You're talking about my work. Your work? Yeah. You know... My work. I shot Kennedy. I confess! You're a hit man, aren't you? See now, I prefer mortality consultant. Where did you put the bodies? Normally that's very privileged information. But, seeing on how we're living together... I'll show you. Show me? -Yeah, it'll be fun! I would rather not. -Oh, come on. Actually, my mom called, we are gonna go for coffee together. - I am fairly positive, you may enjoy this. - Nah. Hello Mmmm! mmm! See now, this is going to help you better empathize with the individuals that we're gonna go see. It's going to make the experience that much richer. Shhh.. This is tough stuff. Struggling against duct tape... only makes it tighter. Okay? So you can do what you want, but I wouldn't do that if I were you, but it's your call. I'm not sure you are going to enjoy this experience like I thought you would. Oh well, anyway, it will be fine. What, have you been working out, girl? And that's how I got myself into the trunk of this car. Help! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!! No one can hear you. Ahhhh! Now you're just startling the wild life, Charlotte. Where are we? Somewhere in the valley, I think. The bodies, they're all here? Affirmative. Where? Where? You're standing on Mister Button. Ahhh! Mister Button? Yeah. That tiny spot right there is that annoying little rat-dog Fruit Loops? I think so. It is hard to keep that little varmint straight. The others, they are all here? Yeah, your whole journal. Cheesy weatherman is right there. Over there is Wick. There, is uh... Chad and Scott. And right there is your old boss. And then a few of my professional clients are mixed in with them. So, homicide is in fact your profession. It's more of a calling, really. How could you do that? What... You mean did I go to school for it? No. I mean, how can you make the taking of human life your profession? How does anyone chose a profession, really? I mean, what makes a professional wrestler? What makes a professional bird watcher? What makes a professional vegetable taster? Who knows how these things sort themselves out? Okay, bird watching isn't a profession. Why not? It's more of a hobby. The Audubon Society is professional bird watchers. No, they're volunteers. Get down on your knees. Excuse me? My instructions were not ambiguous. Why do you want me to get down on my knees? No. I'm a Buddhist. You're going to kill me. Yep. But I thought you loved me. Hey, I do love you. But I'm not going to go to prison for you. - My love has boundaries. - But I'm not going to send you to prison. Oh, so those cops you were talking to, they're helping you with the neighborhood watch program? You know about them? Yeah. Well, I got scared. What do you want, when you find out your boyfriend is a serial killer? Maybe a little bit of gratitude. You know maybe... "Thank you, Lyle." Thank you for making all my dreams come true. Thank you for wasting all those horrible, evil people who ever did me wrong. Well, when you put it that way... No! -Down -Please! Any final words? My mind's a blank. You could say, uh... "Please forgive me God for all my sins." but I'm not Catholic. I'm not going to tell anybody. Okay, okay! God... You know, I tried to be a good person. But, ah... If I'm being totally honest, which... I'm pretty sure is a large component of praying, then ahh... I'm kind of glad the cheesy weatherman is dead. And, since you're God, all powerful and all that, then lying to you is pretty much fruitless. So I must admit... that I'm happy about the prick, who took my virginity being dead too! And let's face it... That asshole, Mister Button... did not deserve to live. I mean, come on! Mister Mister Weller, good riddance. Fruit Loops, bark in the afterlife! Ruff! Ruff! Wick! See ya! Wouldn't want to be ya! And that prick who always took my parking space? Happy trails! My wish list wasn't hypothetical. I genuinely wanted all of them croaked. Every single one. Which could only mean that... Babe, will you get the phone? Yeah. Wilkes Contracting. Oh hi, Mom! Well umm... If it's a girl we're thinking, "Phoebe". If it's a boy, we like "Shane". Lyle Junior. Oh, correction, "Lyle Junior." I'm good. How is dad? Is he still going crazy? Yeah, things are... Things are really good.
