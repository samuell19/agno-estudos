So, obviously I'm on there, yeah, and I'm a shy retiring type as you know, but listen, this bird come round, I'm in there like swimwear and ... Who the fuck are you? What you doing in my house? - Mr. Saviour would like a word with you, sir. - Well Rob can come around here and talk to me himself, can't he? - That's really nice of you, Philip, I thought you was avoiding me. - What, no, why would I avoid you? We've been business partners for years. - Yeah, we have. But you think it's acceptable to steal from me? - Rob, listen, you're using my venue to launder all this cash and you're using it all the time. Look, I'm entitled here to do what I think is reasonable, but I've got expenses innit. ♪ Waiting for the shock waves to begin ♪ ♪ I wanna hold you for one time ♪ Come on, Rob, you need to be fair about this, yeah? - Fair? That's a good word that. [Philip shouting] I'll give you fair. Now, where's the keys to the shop? - Keys, they're in the study on the side board. Fuck. - Being in business with me has boundaries. Do you understand? Now you've lost your shop. - Yeah. - I don't want you to lose anymore. All right, Philip, I'll be seeing you soon, all right? - Yeah, all right. [upbeat dramatic music] - You should come over more often. Girls are never this well behaved. - I don't believe that for a second. Still doing gymnastics? - Yeah, but not as often as we used to. - Oh, why is that? - Well, because they want to be doing horse riding or ballet or whatever else it is on the agenda for that week. - Oh I see. - I wish we could do everything. - I'm sure your dad will fit time in to do everything. - Can we go go-karting, Uncle Rob? Daddy said you're amazing at it. - I used to be good at it, yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course we'll go. Me and your dad will sort something out and we'll all go together. - Yes. - Can we go watch TV? - Yes, go on. I'll give you a shout when your uncle's leaving. - They're good kids, you know. - Yes they are, they mean the world to me. - Do they ever ask about their mum? - Not for about a year now. - Good, 'cause they don't need her, them girls. - We both know your feelings on Kate, Dad. - He is right, though. - Of course I'm fucking right. I'm always fucking right. [men laughing] - No plans for kids yourself? - You're joking, ain't you? I'm a 35-year-old child myself. But I put some of my legacy away for the girls. Don't worry about that. - Worried, what have I got to worry about? I've got nothing to worry about. - Damn right there's nothing to worry about. Right, I'm off, business to attend to. - Girls, your uncle's leaving. - See you later, girls. Dad, lift's leaving if you want it. [gentle music] - Take care, brother. - Take care. [gentle music] - Business still good, boy? - Yeah, I ain't totally fucked it up yet. - That ain't what I meant. - Come on, we both know you wanted Mason to take the family business. - It's your business now, son. I just gave you the foundations of it and that's all. You're doing pretty well I heard. - Oh, cheers. - You're a bit touchy recently. What's the matter with you? - Nah, it's just people starting to take advantage, you know? Starting to piss me off. - Yeah, well you gotta let them people know if they want to try and fuck with you, they're the ones who's gonna end up being fucked. - Yeah, I know. - allright? - I know, I'm on it. - You get that video I sent you of the old bill? - Yeah, I'm meeting him after I've dropped you off. - Superb, that should keep him off your back for a little while that. - How'd you get that anyway? That's some nasty shit. - I figure the less you know about that sort of shit, the better for you. - Fair enough. [engine rumbling] [dark music] [footsteps padding] - Give me a beer. [dark music] Put it on his tab. - That's strange. He's already opened one up in your name. [dark music] - So have you done the research? - Yeah. Not guaranteed, though, is it? It's all hearsay. - Trust me, I know. - And how can you be so sure? - I did his books and his dad's books for many years. I know how the money came in, how they laundered it and how they spread it amongst different accounts to make it look like legitimate investments. - Look, if this guy's got 25 mil, stashed away, it's not just gonna be under his mattress now, is it? Now if we want that money, we've gotta get close. - Well, there is no we here. He knows me too well, I can't get close to this. - So, I'll just take all the risk myself then, shall I? And why are you suddenly just hell-bent on screwing him over? - Well let's just say, for a crooked accountant, the pension package isn't exactly lucrative. - So you want me to steal his money and give it to you? - I only want what I'm owed. You get to keep all the money apart from one mil. That's my finder's fee, completely worthwhile. - Worth it? You know what this guy does to people who cross him? - He's not that violent anymore. He has mellowed. - Mellowed? One guy stole 40 grand from him, he smashed his shin bones in half with a metal bar then chopped the end of his fingers off. - Listen. - No, no, no. - The next poor unfortunate guy robbed his brother's house, chopped his feet off, kept him alive for three days and then set a fire to him. Doesn't sound very mellow to me. - Well that's his weakness, his family. - It's almost like you're talking Swahili. You want me to go after his family now, after what I just told you? - Look, they take all the money they make from less scrupulous businesses, wash it clean through around 40 to 50 legitimate businesses and then spread the money into new accounts around the world. The account detail, digital passcodes, and signatures are all in Rob's business or house somewhere. We find them, we are golden. Set for life. Now, I'm not asking you to go after his family. I'm saying find a way to get close to Rob. - This is nuts, you're nuts. - He only has two henchmen. - Henchmen? Is he a fucking Bond villain now, as well? - Well, whatever they are, Korbin and Pete, both extremely violent and fiercely loyal. Then there's Joe, he runs the pub. And Freddie, his driver and cleanup man. The rest of the people are not well known to Rob. So he'll be looking for more people he can trust. Get yourself into the inner circle and we may find a way of getting our hands on his cash. - So how would you propose that I get close? - Well, he owns and spends a lot of time in The Pig and Truffle. - The pub on Simington Street? - Yeah. Start drinking in there. He will soon make your acquaintance. Joe, the bartender, he's a proper sort, so be careful of him. Where are you going? - Going to get my head tested for even thinking about this. - Good luck. - Luck? I need a fucking miracle. He's picking up the tab, yeah? - Fine by me. [dark music] [dramatic music] - I'm here to see Rob Savior. - Over there. [bucket clattering] Weapons in the bucket. - What? - It's a no weapon zone. I don't want claret spilling in my boozer. Weapons in the bucket. [dramatic music] [gun clattering] - Satisfied? - What can I get you? - I'm not here to drink. - You wanna stay? You have a drink. - Water. - I'll get you a beer. Take a seat. [dramatic music] [chair scraping] - Ah, Captain. Good to see ya. - You wanted to see me in a public place. No privacy? - Oh, it's private in here mate. Give us five minutes lads, will ya? [chairs scraping] [footsteps fading] - You boys don't normally drink in here, do ya? - No, first time. - Oh, I don't think you guys seem to notice the lack of people in here might be your cue to fuck off. - Well, can we at least finish our drinks first? - Again, my cue to just tell you to fuck off, now. - Definitely ain't fucking coming back here again. - [Korbin] You won't be anyway, mate, don't worry. - Out of courtesy, I should tell you that your operation is over. We've gathered enough evidence, witnesses, and with a little creative accounting. I can have all your businesses shut down and you thrown in jail. So, whatever the reason was that you summoned me here, it ain't working, big boy. You're done. - Well, sounds like you got me bang to rights. - Dear, oh dear. - What a name you'll make for yourself? Get a promotion. Maybe even get knighthood. - Okay, you have two choices the way I see it. You can hand yourself in and cooperate. Or do I have to send a team round to your family home 3:00 AM, have you dragged out, embarrassed in front of your friends and neighbors? Because quite frankly I'm happy either way. - I've got a third option for you, which I sincerely hope you consider. - Okay. - Make you richer and me protected. Then we can do away with all this hostility bollocks. - Well, I guess in that case then, I will have to add you attempting to bribe the police captain. - It's not bribery, common sense. See, there are three reasons you should take me up on my offer. One, I know where you live. With your two daughters, Ellie and Rose. And your beautiful wife, Mary, like the virgin. Well, if you have me arrested, I can't guarantee their protection. [chair slamming] [table rocking] Sit down. [soft upbeat music] Some fucking respect or I'll slit your throat. Now, take a look at the screen. I've got something to show you. [upbeat music] Now see, you come in here and swing your dick around and now it's shrunk to the size of a raisin. - This cannot get out. - I'm a man of my word. You help me, I'll protect you. - And what is that you want for this protection? - All I want is for you to just turn a blind eye to me. - You're a total fucking asshole, you know that? - I've been called worse. Do we have a deal? [chair squeaking] - Fuck you. [upbeat music] [gun clicking] [upbeat music] - What do you mean a different direction? We had a deal. [door opening] Fine, fuck you. [phone slamming] - Problems? - Find out everything you can on Rob Saviour. This is the third deal I lost because of that fucking mug. - Let's fucking sort him out, shall we? - We need to do our homework, though, 'cause we don't know what we're getting ourselves into. - All right, I'll do some digging. - Put the kettle on. - Fucking servant as well am I? [fist thudding] [Davey grunting] - Davey, how are you? - You taking the piss? - Cor, they've roughed you up, haven't they? I'm sorry, Davey, it's not how I like to do business. Untie him, will you? - You sure, boss? - Where the fuck's he gonna run to? - Good point. - That's better. Go on, stand up, walk around if you want. - I'm okay, thanks. [gravel crunching] - Now, you understand my dilemma. I've had 470K going missing. And I've been informed that you know where it is. It's not good to lose that kind of money. Now where is it? [dramatic music] - Clearly your sources are wrong. - Yeah, maybe. I trust him more than I fucking trust you. - You said yourself, you searched everywhere. - We did. - I don't have it. - Searched your business, your home, your car, nothing. [Davey screaming] - Just stop, just stop, stop please. I told you everything I know. - Don't make this any worse than it needs to be. Not good for business to lose that kind of cash. Now where is it? - I told you all I know! - See them boys there? They're loyal and vicious. Korbin, for example, he'd quite happily rape and strangle women to death. Married blondes, he likes. He draws the line at kids, makes him sick. Now, that little sick fuck there, he'll quite happily rape a 12-year-old girl on the way home from school. Hang on a minute, your girl's 12 years old, ain't she? - No, no, no. Please, please. No, no, Rob, no, please. [soft dramatic music] [Davey crying] - Tell me where it is, or I jam this dagger up in your kneecap. - No harm will come to them? - You have my word. - And me? - Don't fucking push it. - Okay, okay. - Okay what? - I've got your money. It's in the seats. - What? What fucking seats? - The car. It's in the lining of the seats. [Davey grunting] - In the lining of the seats? We checked the fucking car, didn't we, boys? - [Korbin] Yes, boss, Pete did. - Well, I didn't check inside the lining of one in the back of the car. - What you searched the fucking only way you can see. - Well, yeah. The boot, under the seats. - The little muggy prick stole 470K away from me and you think he's gonna put it on the fucking dashboard? - I suppose not. - I'm sorry you've gotta see this, Davey. - [Davey] Sorry about what? [Pete screaming] - Korbin, take him and go search the car properly this time. - Yes, boss. [soft dramatic music] - My family? - Davey, my little weasel of a friend, come with me. [Davey grunting] If the money's there and all accounted for, no harm will come to 'em. - Oh, thank you. - You, on the other hand. - Oh, come on, man. We've known each other for years. I didn't know that money was yours. - Grow some balls, man. You knew what you were doing. - Oh come, come on, let me work for you. I'll pay off my debt. - Come here. Is it there? - Give us two minutes. - That's really clever how you hid it in them seats like that. - I've got a lot of skills I could bring to your organization. - Found it! - I should fucking hope so, I told you where it was. You fucking waste of space. And while you're down there, count it and put it in the duffel bags and take it back to the office. - Do you want us to count it here? - Yes, I fucking do. - See, I told you the truth. It's gotta count for something. - Yeah, after I made some serious threats to your family and put a hole in your foot. - Yeah, but still, you've got all your money back. We're okay, aren't we? Yeah? - Not fucking nearly. - No, no, no, wait, wait! Don't kill me! Don't kill me! - That drop won't kill you. It'll break your ankle or your legs. - No, no, no, no, don't, I need my legs. - Well, I suggest you land on another fucking part of your body then. [Davey screaming] [body thudding] Told ya. [footsteps fading] [soft dramatic music] - Steady on, I'm unarmed. It's a reciprocal meeting, Daniel. - You have been reading word of the day toilet paper again. What are you going on about? - A meeting that benefits us both, Daniel. - Look, knock that shit off, it's Jackson. - Oh, it's just that your criminal record has you named as Daniel Jackson. [Daniel sighing] - So. [lighter clicking] What d'you want? - Well, I want your criminal record to simply disappear and I can make that happen. - Yeah, for a pretty penny, I bet. - You could say that. I want you to take care of an issue for me. - What kind of an issue? - First problem, I need a pest removing. [Daniel sniffing] - So, are you fucking drunk? The captain of the Met Police wants a criminal to murder someone for him. Wipe the record clean. You've had too much cocaine in your corn flakes, pal. - I can assure you this is a completely legitimate offer. - Ah, who is it? - I'll send the file in the week. - Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. I want to know who it is first. - Why does that matter? Huh? You go into the house, you pull the trigger. I make sure you're not implicated. You get paid and you get your record clean. - 100% clean, no comeback on me. - I will even give you the date and the time so you can go in and get out clean. - This is fucked up. - You have no idea. Keep your phone on. Well, piss off then. - Ah, right. - You really are fucking thick, aint ya? [soft dramatic music] - It's not a hard decision, Dad. - It's a very important part of the game. - Dad? - Yes, Petra? - Do you miss Mum? - What? Of course. Why'd you ask? - Some kids at school were talking about us not having a mum and it just got me thinking. - Kids? What kids? What're they saying? - Nothing like that. Just, we were chatting about parents. Daddy, what happened to Mummy? - She went to heaven a long time ago, Princess. - I can almost remember her. - I think you probably remember more of what we've told ya than you're actual memory, Darling. - How did it happen? - Very suddenly. - Petra is right, it was suddenly, but very peacefully. It was a blood clot. - What's a blood clot? - That's a very good question. Um, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I believe it stops the blood going to the brain. So it stops the brain functioning correctly. - Sometimes my teacher says Timmy Nolan's brain doesn't function properly. - That's probably 'cause he's not listening. - He never listens. - What was she like, Dad? - Your mum? Oh, she was an amazing woman. Lovely, caring, absolutely beautiful. She wouldn't be having any of this. Not at this time, before bed. No way. But she did the good stuff that made you two like as great as you are, you know? - She sounds amazing. - She really was. Now, come on, let's finish this and let's get to bed, okay? - Can we have a cooked breakfast tomorrow? - If you're gonna help me, yeah. Okay. [soft upbeat music] [upbeat dramatic music] - That's no way to treat a lady. - [Pete] No weapons. She's fine. - Shall I get rid of her boss? - No, this is all right. Probably got bigger bollocks than all of us anyway, to approach me at this table. - Thank you very much. - So what'd you want? - I have a business proposition for you. - No, you don't - What? - You have a business proposition that benefits you and you need my help to get it. Now, if you don't leave this table, I'll have you escorted. - What, you'll have your monkeys do it for you? - All right, you got 30 seconds, go. - Okay, listen, you control all of the importing and the exporting of the drugs in this city, Rob. I want in, I can expand this business. - You want me to help you grow your business? - Well, yeah, of course it will help you. - I don't need an extra something. My businesses run all by their self. - Come on Rob, we could make a really good team together. - Time's up. - [Shannon] We can make a really good team, Rob. We could take over the city. - I run this city. I don't need anyone else's help. - You really are a arrogant prick, aren't you? You'll regret this. - Fuck off. [Shannon shouting] [upbeat dramatic music] - Philip, Rob would like a word with you. - Well, tell him to come and have a word with me, then. - You want me to ask him to come to your home to discuss your shortcomings? - Oh, well, now that you put it like that. [upbeat dramatic music] [car door slamming] - Comfy there, Phil? You ain't got your seatbelt on. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. And you? - Well, I'm all right, but why are you lookin' at me like you wanna dry hump my leg? - Let's just say I'm looking forward to seeing you get what you deserve. - Fuck you. I deserve to be treated better than this. Yeah, that's what I deserve. - You deserve what the boss says you fucking deserve! - Hey, boys, you keep the noise down, please. Giving me the fucking asshole. [soft dramatic music] - Mate, my beer is flat. - No, it isn't. Beer's never flat, mate. - Come on, mate, this is flat as fuck. - I've already told ya, it isn't flat, yeah? So, here's your choice, drink it or leave. - Listen, mate. [head slamming] - Fucking dick. [soft dramatic music] Korbin, escort the gentleman off the premises, please. He's clearly had too much to drink. [soft dramatic music] - Some people, eh? Some people, eh? - We heard you the first time, just not interested. - What, uh, what are you watching? - What, are your eyes broken? - No, no, I mean is it a rerun, is it live or? - Well, what'd you want? Clearly not here to watch the football. - Glad you asked, 'cause I would like a job. - Talk to Joe. He owns the place. - It's not a bar job I'm after. - You've come into a bar asking for a job, not for a bar? - I wanna work for you. - You don't know what I do. - I know you're a man I'd like to work for. - Based on? - Reputation, research. - That sounds like snooping to me. Tell you what, I'll give you a job. Get in them toilets, get 'em nice and spotless for me, after a few months I'll promote you to full cleaner. How's that sound? - No, no, you listen- - No, you fucking listen. I've got people around me that I want and need. But I don't fucking want or need you. Now, thanks for the interest. Now fuck off. - I guess I'll be going then. [soft dramatic music] - Ah, from one fuckwit to another. - Look, Rob, I don't appreciate being dragged across town. - I don't give a fucking pig's dirty ass what you fucking want. Let me show you some facts. [soft dramatic music] Now. The restaurant you run for me. Takes 40K a week. By the time it reaches the accounts, there's only 35 in there. So I just wanna know, where's 5K going a week? - What? You, you go through the accounting? - Yeah, I go through the fucking accounts. [soft dramatic music] - Look, look, look, look. I'm sorry, honestly. This is all laundered cash, innit? Yeah, the businesses take enough cash, so you know, we thought to take a little hit, isn't it? I've got expenses. - What, do I not pay you enough? - No, no no no, it's not like that, Rob. It's not like that. Sweet, it's all sweet. - I don't like disloyal people. [Philip screaming] [dramatic music] I've got a reputation to uphold. Nothing personal. [Rob roaring] [upbeat dramatic music] - Yes, we had a deal. That still stands. But I can't turn a blind eye to everything, okay. [knocking on door] Ah, Kim, how can I help you? - So, listen. We are pretty sure Rob Saviour is behind Davey being in hospital. If we link the two together, we can put a case together. - Let's not put all our eggs in that basket, though, yeah? - But, sir. - Look, I know that Rob is a good suspect on this one. I do. But there may be other options to consider. - With all due respect, sir. - Look, all I'm asking is that we consider other options. - This is nailed on. With everything else that he's involved in, we could put this guy away for a long time. - Kim, you've put a really good strong case together. You have. And I appreciate that, okay. But you know how long I've been after this fucking family. It's gotta be airtight, watertight. We can't make any mistakes. We just can't be so single-minded that we don't consider somebody else for this, that's all. - Of course. - Anything else? - No, sir. - Uncle Rob, your house is so cool. - Not as cool as yours. - I love it when we come over. - Me too. Can we watch a movie in the cinema room tonight? - Of course you can. As long as your dad said it's all right. - Of course. I get to choose, though. - Dad, you choose lame films. - Charming. - Whatever your dad picks, we'll watch it. - Threes. - Go fish. - Oh. - You, fucking insane. And this is some kinda fucking joke! - Sh, calm down, yeah. - You're outta your little skull if you think I'm doing this. - You got the paperwork then? - Yes, but I'm out! - This isn't Dragon's Den, Sunshine. You're already in. - Not a chance. - Listen, Princess, everything's in motion now, okay? This is gonna be the easiest payday you've ever had. - 20K. - What? - 20K. Record wiped, and new identity. - You've been watching too many FBI cop shows. It doesn't work like that. - He's a fucking madman. I can't go after him! - Okay. Okay, I know you're scared. 10K, and the record wiped. Come on, that's life-changing for you. - Fuck. - You've got this, okay? - This isn't right. Something aint right! - Tuesday next week. The rest of the details are in the pack I dropped in. Make sure it's done. - If you fuck me ... - You'll what, huh? You'll what? You'll do exactly what I tell you to do when I tell you to do it! I'm giving you a life-changing opportunity here to change your life, you ungrateful little prick. Now then, get it done and we can both go our separate ways. Both of us, much happier.

He is a creature of habit. Every Wednesday morning, he goes to his local restaurant to have breakfast. He heads in through the back way, I assume to take care of some business and then he heads into the main cafe area to have a hearty breakfast. He then goes to his local pub to meet up with his crew. That gives us two minutes to snatch him, take him and bring the fucker to the warehouse and kill him. We take his businesses, his money and his crew. - [Thug] You sure we can pull this off or what? - Yes, we will stick to the plan and we will be fine. There are more of us than him at this point. By the time that he gets to the warehouse, no one will know anything and no one will tie it to us. That little prick has loads of enemies. - So we go this Wednesday? - You're damn right. Don't be afraid to rough him up a little bit if needs be, yeah? - Sounds like my kinda fucking job. [soft dramatic music] [upbeat music] [Rob whistling] - Fuck me, I think I need to get a better security system. - Shut the fuck up. - Did you kill my cleaner? They're hard to come by these days. - I'd be more concerned about what's gonna happen to you. - The girl? It's a shame. I liked her. - Yeah, and I said shut the fuck up. [deodorant spraying] - Don't know you, do I? Wondering why you're here with a gun in my face. - Someone wants you dead, so they sent me here to do the job for 'em. - What you? Why would they do that then? - Because I'm a hired killer. - You're not. You're a soppy prick with a gun. And a toy gun at that. - Oh, I assure you, this aint no fucking toy gun. - If you was a pro, I'd be dead by now. You'd have a silencer, and you'd have done me as soon as I got outta the shower. - Yeah, well, they wanted me to give you a message before I put a bullet in you. - Oh, this'll be good. Was it in crayon? - You know, I'm beginning to understand why they want you dead. - Before you do that, can you send him a message for me? - [scoffs] What is it? Last man's dead wish. - [chuckles] Yeah, something like that, yeah. - Go on. Spit it out. - Well tell them, I hope they kept the receipt when they hired you. [gun firing] [body thudding] [doors closing] Freddie? I need my carpet cleaning at my place. No, nothing major. Just a few blood stains. Might need a bit of paint and all. Today, Freddie.

Thank you, Officer. - Welcome, sir. - [Kim] Yes, sir. - I think we have a new angle on our friend, Mr. Saviour. - Really, sir? - Yeah. Speak to the arresting officers, get as much information as you can, and get them on our side. We need help with every job of this. - Okay, sir. - Yes. - Hello, Davey. [Davey groaning] - I've had a pretty rough couple of weeks. Can we catch up tomorrow? - Come on. Let's go. - Can I go and have a shower first? - My orders are to take you straight to Mr. Saviour. [Davey groaning] - I guess we're going to see Mr. Savior then aren't we? [Davey sighing] - Come on, in you get. - Yeah, all right. All right, all right. - Mind your pinkies. - So you're happy this is kosher, yeah? - It's watertight, Mr. Saviour. If there are any issues, you will be heavily compensated. - It's not about the money, though. I can't lose face on this. - I know. I have added a clause about a quick close in there. There is very little wiggle room. If you're not happy, don't sign it, Mr. Saviour. I will pass on your apologies. - No, I just gotta go for it. Thanks for your hard work and diligence on this, Miss Kincaid. - You're welcome. I'll get these papers handed in, and we should complete the deal soon. - Good work. Fancy a drink after to celebrate? - Mr. Saviour, I'm your solicitor, not one of your whores for the night. But I do appreciate the invite. Have a good afternoon. - Fuck me she's a bit touchy, aint she? - Mm. Yeah. - So what does Rob want with me then? He's already thrown me off a roof. - I thought you wanted to work for him. - I did, but then he threw me off a fucking roof. - Don't be so sensitive. Just means he likes you. Ha! - Hello, Davey. Nice of you to join us. Just had this little prick come to my house try and kill me. Daniel Jackson, according to that. - Seriously? I thought I was looking for another chap. This chap right here. Franklin Joseph. - He was the one from the bar, but he aint the one that just tried to kill me. - I guess you're just too popular, boss. - Don't you have a fucking mess to clean up? - Well, Franklin Joseph, not affiliated with anyone we know, doesn't have a criminal record. Not the sort of person we'd associate, you know, trying to get us. - What's he want? - Listen, Rob, I just wanna get back to my family. - I wanna know what he wants and why the sudden interest. - Kids'll be wondering where I am. - Once we know that, we can move forward. - Rob? - I don't give a fuck! You work for me now. You go home when I fucking say you go home, or you won't have a family to go home to. How's that? - Okay. - I can't hear ya. - Okay! - Fucking gratitude. Give him a job, and all he does is fucking sulk about it. Fuck off home. Come back Thursday, three o'clock. - What for? - Fucking work. - What work? - Swear to God, Davey, I'm gonna beat the fucking living daylights outta you with your own shoe in a minute. Now fuck off. Take the gun with you, and I'll fucking tell you what to do with it. Go on. [crutch thumping] - I'll do some digging. You know, find out what I can. But, to be honest with you, he seems really legit to me. - Cheers. Who's this Daniel Jackson joker then? - Well, this guy's a different kettle of fish. I mean, he's done arson. Been in the slammer at least twice. - He said someone paid him to kill me? - Okay, well, just relax. Leave it with me. I'll do some digging, do some research on some known associates, et cetera. Just, leave it with me. I'm on it. - Cheers. [soft suspenseful music] - So, where are we? What do we know? - He's a petty criminal and drug dealer, sir. - Do we know how he got here? - Well, it looks like he was driven through there. And dumped. But there's no CCTV on the roads. - Another drug deal gone to shit, yeah? - Probably. Anything else we need to know? Fuck. - [Kim] Is everything okay, sir? - No, nothing. - [Kim] Do you recognize him? - What? No, I mean, just, that's horrible, right? I mean, this city. - You okay, boss? - Yeah, yeah. I'm good. Let's get the scene wrapped. Anything of interest on the body? - We found a gun, and it's been sent off for ballistics and testing right now, so we'll see. - Okay. [suspenseful music] - I'm worried about you, sir. You look terrible. - No, I'm fine, really. I'm more worried about your driving. - I know I shouldn't complain, but it really upsets me. - No one likes to be made fun of. - How was I supposed to know that? - Just forget it. It will all be forgotten by tomorrow. - I suppose so. How was your day? - Another day of GCSE revision. Life can't get any better. - Then we're in big trouble. - We'll be fine. I'm excited for another games night. - Can't wait. What are we doing tonight? - Swimming for you and ballet for me. - I don't wanna ... [engine idling] - Girls, how are we? - Uncle Freddie! Yay! - Have you come to pick us up? How come? - There's a bit of a chill in the air, isn't it? I promised your dad I'd give you a lift home. - [Petra] No, there isn't. - Maybe, but there's two hot chocolates in the back of the car, and they'll go cold if you walk. [engine idling] [car dinging] [doors closing] [wind blowing] - [Franklin] Hey, Rob. - [Rob] Fuck sake. - [Franklin] Rob, just wait. - [Rob] Joseph, right? - Franklin Joseph, yeah yeah. I think we got off on the wrong foot the other day. - Really? I don't think so. - Look, Rob, I don't wanna go down a road we can't come back from, you know what I mean? - What are you going on about, you fucking idiot? - Look, I need some cash and you got plenty of it. - You want my cash? - Call it an insurance policy. - An insurance for what? - Say it stops your brother and your nieces getting in any nasty accidents. - Are you seriously threatening my family? - Call it harmless blackmail, Rob, yeah. Meet you on Saturday, by the bridge. Plenty of people around there. - I'll save you the time on Saturday. Don't bother turning up. You aint getting a fucking penny. Now fuck off. - Fuck off, man, I'll break your legs. - You'll regret that, Rob! - I've heard that a lot lately. Keep an eye on him, will ya? - No worries, boss. Leave it with me. [upbeat suspenseful music] - So working my magic here, gents, it would seem that the gentleman who tried to kill you was a drug dealer, a thief, and he's been in the joint a couple of times. - What would he wanna kill me for? - Beats me, you're such a lovely geezer. - [Rob] Shut up. - Well using some fancy facial recognition, I have found some images which you might find interesting. - Yeah, go on. [upbeat dramatic music] The little fucking rat. - Who is he? - The fucking cop. The police captain. The pervert. - Well there is further news on our friend Joseph Franklin. - Don't worry about him. He is a fucking idiot. - I wouldn't be so sure, boss. He has been spotted on CCTV. He's been spotted near Mason's house, and he's been spotted at your nieces' house. - Fucking what? [upbeat dramatic music] [phone ringing] - Rob? - Kill him today. - Do what? - I'll send you the details. - Today? - It's fucking today, not fucking tomorrow. Today. If he goes anywhere near my family, I will destroy yours. - Right. Come on, girls, let's go see your mum. Come on. [upbeat music] - Daddy? - Yeah? - What's for dinner? - Pizza. - The good police captain. I wanna sort a meet next week. - Consider it done. - That's two little ducks taken care of. Are you ready? - Yeah, no drama, boss. - We got it. - I don't want no fucking hiccups. [upbeat music] [fist striking] [Rob groaning] - Ease up a bit, pal. She wants him in one piece. - He's a big boy. He can take it. - Just make sure he can talk by the time the boss gets here, yeah? - Maybe we should slice up this little fucker now. - Well, I like the sound of that. - Yeah, go on. Fucking A. - Max, she's here! - Now just sit there like a nice little boy, all right? - You just wouldn't listen to my proposal, would you? You had to be the stupid, pigheaded Rob everyone warned me you were. We could have achieved great things if we had joined forces. - I don't need any help from a little slut like you who's trying to tell me how to run things. - Now, you got nothing, not even a funeral. - I'll be here long after you love. - I doubt that. I have you by your balls, Rob. I have your men, your businesses and now I even have you. - If you let me go, I won't kill your family, your friends, your business associates. Fuck it, I'll even throw your cat in there. You fucking fuck bag. - Show some respect. Let me finish this shit off right now! - Did one of my lads hit you too hard there, Rob? I'm not sure you know what's happening. I have you bound by the hands, bleeding heavily. I have a gun and a knife, and I'm about to kill you. - I'll take that as a no then. - Are you fucking crazy? Take him over there and string him up. [soft dramatic music] Fucking hero, you are. Get up. I don't want you on your knees when I-- - You think I didn't have your boys, you little prick? - Come on, Rob. You're not gonna do this. - Your boys told me your plan a long time ago. - Fucking traitors! So what now? - Just thinking about it. - I could, I could-- [gun firing] [soft dramatic music] - Fuck me she don't half go on. - How the fuck did you put up with her? Were you loyal to her? All right, fuck off. - You sure, boss? - He knows what's happening if he comes back. [soft dramatic music] You work for me now. [soft dramatic music] Clean this shit up, boys. [door closing] - Don't worry, your barkeep disarmed me outside. This a bad time? - No, I wanted to see you. Sit down. - What happened? - Oh, you know, creative differences. - So, why did you wanna see me? - I got a big problem. That little prick Jackson you tried to kill me with. - Whoa, wait. - No more lies or deceit. Just listen. - Listening. - I got a big delivery coming in the country next few weeks. And I just don't need no prying eyes or ears about. You do that for me, and me and you are even. - So I do this for you, and this is all over? - Yeah, I'll forgive you for trying to kill me. - Do you blame me? - Seems to be everyone's favorite hobby at the minute. - Let's hope no one succeeds then. - Maxwell will send you the details. - I do hope that's not causing you too much pain. [soft music] Fucking pricks. - Yeah. They got lots of money. Yeah, everything's in motion. Don't you worry. Yeah. [soft dramatic music] The money'll be there. We'll get it sorted. Right. See ya later. [soft dramatic music] - Hey, you okay, pal? Take it easy. - I'm so sorry. - No no, take whatever you want. Wallet, watch, whatever. - This is not robbery. - Looks a bit like a robbery. - Shut up. I have to do this! - You aint gotta do anything. - No, he'll kill my family. I'm trying to protect my family. Surely you understand that. - Of course I understand that. You want to do what's right for you and your family. This isn't gonna end well for anybody. Have you ever taken a life? - Shut up. - Take it easy. This is gonna be ingrained in your brain forever. You'll see my face every day when you wake up. My family will hold you accountable for the rest of your life. - What about my family? Rob'll kill them all! He's a fucking monster. - He is a monster. You're not. I'm not. Just put the gun down. - No no. [Davey groaning] Oh. - Why the fuck does Rob want me dead? - You went to his kids' school. You went to his house. You threatened his family, man! - It's just a threat. It's nothing but intel to fucking blackmail him. - He thinks you're a threat. - I wasn't a threat. I am now. - What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna destroy everything he loves. - And me? - Take your family, get the fuck outta this country. Don't ever come back. [soft dramatic music] [footsteps running] - There he is, the man him fucking self. - Oh, leave off, Dad. - I'm only messing. - He only wants your approval. - He's got my approval. He's doing fine. Just not as good as you would if you took some fucking interest in it, man. - Look, we've been through this. I got the girls to think about aint I. - I know, I know. - You're not changing me mind on this, Dad, sorry. - I know. - Oi oi. - Hello, Rob, how you doing? Let's get you a drink? - No, I can't stay long. I got Petra's birthday presents in the car. - Okay. I'll give you a hand, yeah? - Sweet, yeah. - Dad all right? He didn't say a word. - Yeah, just having one of his moments. - Things all right? - Yeah, just old and senile, you know? - As long as he's all right. Let's get these fucking presents, eh? - Yeah yeah, sweet. - Come on. [upbeat music] - You want the weapons in the bucket? - Won't be necessary today. I'm sure you won't be staying. - Is Rob around? - No. - Good. Let's talk Joseph. - Nothing I wanna say to you. - Not even if I mention Enzo? - Enzo, what's he got to do with this? - Enzo's been involved in an altercation. The evidence points to him or someone else being the culprit. I really don't want it to go against him. - What are you talking about? - Someone has to do some serious jail time for this. And you are in a position to choose. Your son or somebody else. Somebody more deserving perhaps. - So you, you're dodgy as fuck. - Hey, your boss started this war, not me. - So what do you want? - Well, I'm in a position to clear Enzo completely. As long as you cooperate. - At what cost? - You think I want money? - No, but you obviously want payment of some kind. - Not here. Meet me at the embankment tomorrow, sunrise. - Why not just talk here? - Because I prefer, more neutral surroundings. [soft dramatic music] See you tomorrow, Joseph. [door closing] [soft dramatic music] - You do know who my family is, don't you? - Yeah, I fucking do. You tell him to pay the fucking money, or someone's gonna get seriously hurt. - You mean to tell me you know who my family is and you have the bollocks to come into my fucking house? [dramatic music] [fists striking] - Dad? - It's okay, doll. - It's okay, don't worry. Just go back to bed. It's okay. [fist striking] - Fuck. Shit. [soft dramatic music] [legs thudding] [soft dramatic music] Girls, it's fine. He just needs our help. Okay, come on. Come and help me. - Dad? - Come and help me. - Dad? - Come on, put the gun down. Put the gun down. It's okay. - No, no! - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, he's gonna be all right. He's gonna be all right. [gun firing] Fuck. Fuck. Oh shit. Oh fuck. [soft dramatic music] Fuck. What the fuck have I done? Fuck. Fuck. James, James. Come on. Come on. [Franklin breathing hard] James, James. Don't care what time it is, James.

He's just lost his brother and his nieces. Have some compassion. - See, I thought you were smarter than that, Joe. I did. But, I understand and respect your loyalty. Just hope your son has a good lawyer. [Joe sighing] - Okay. Wait. - Good lad. - When? - Tuesday evening. Rob has meetings every Wednesday morning, right? Oh and, uh, make yourself scarce. 10:30 sharp. You really don't wanna be involved in this. Oh, and uh, not a word to your boss, yeah?
