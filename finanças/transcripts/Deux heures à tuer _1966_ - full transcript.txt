Auvernaux, a small quiet town, 10 000 inhabitants, two factories, a glove factory, a beautiful collegiate church. Some rich and important citizens, some very big fortunes. And a small train station on the outskirts of the city. A small station similar to all others. Who would have imagined that we could shudder when evoking the small station of Auvernaux? And yet, for some time now, the great black bird of fear has been hovering over the little town. A faceless murderer has been prowling the streets. A criminal madman who has struck several times at night. Several young women have been murdered by the monster, who, on a strange whim, has taken off one of her shoes. A macabre relic that he went to hide God knows where and why. STOP POLICE That's why most people don't dare to go out at night. Despite the increasing number of police. How to find a being who kills without reason. What face can he have, who does he look like? But one thing is certain, it's always in the immediate vicinity of the railroad bridge that he is on the lookout to strike. He holds his breath in the shadows of the trees. You're gripped by the urge to flee this nightmare city. To get as far away as possible from this sinister railroad bridge. To escape from this anguish which weighs on the city, like a lead cloak. The murderer himself may want to escape… who knows? The net is tightening slowly but surely, little by little, around the station. Around the quiet little station of Auvernaux. EXIT The train to Chaumont, Bar-sur-Aube, Troyes and Romilly is announced. First class car at the head of the train. Mr. Alphonse, is this the last train today? No, there's still the 11:48 p.m. one, but it's not as good. -Excuse me, buddy. -Don't worry. They asked me to make sure you leave. They really wanted me to leave. You have to be motivated to do your job in a place like this. -You made progress in the case. -It's not easy. -No. -You say that to make me feel better? No, and at least you got some fresh air. -I'm abroad as soon as I leave Paris. -People from the country are weird. You don't even have to speak. You stand in front of them and they curl up like hedgehogs. -Oh, we have to go. -As if they were guilty of something. A cigarette. Oh, shit, I'm out of cigarettes. At least, you have a piece of evidence. A shoe… even with a stiletto heel, there's nothing to be proud of. They'll be happy with this in Paris, it's a piece of evidence. They'll see that you're not finished. I'm finished. The old man has to retire. That's what they say. Don't say that, they like you a lot. -For the little cases in the suburbs. -No! No! They even asked you to make me go away. -To get me back on the train. -Well, you'll miss it. Go on. That's the job. I would have liked to discover something. -My idea was pretty good, no? -What idea? -My candy jar. -Yeah, that was pretty good. I didn't have time to use it. You can play with your candy jar on the train. Hurry up, I still have work to do. -I like you. -Yes, I know. But don't worry, I'll let those bastards know who I am. So, will you buy a ticket? -No. -Yes, you will! Don't worry, you'll have your moment! Oh, you're very kind, thinking I'll have my moment. I've wanted to buy a new coat for two years and I can't afford it. -You don't have the time. -I don't have the money. I have a wife, kids, no TV. I take the subway. And I never drink with them. That's what pisses off the management. The train is about to leave. -Watch out, it's leaving. Bye. -Bye. -Hey, do you have a cigarette? -Yes, here. You're nice, thanks. -Close the doors. -Take this one for the trip. I was hoping for it. It's the case of a lifetime. -I'll never get a chance like this. -You will! Unless a miracle happens. And in that case, I'd become famous. Take your train first. Ciao. Excuse me. I don't have time to talk. Sir! Couldn't you keep it waiting? Didn't you see that I was late? I was lucky not to break my leg. A train doesn't normally start like that. -Huh? Then how does it start? -Well, slowly, gently. -You should have arrived on time. -It's a train for acrobats. -The schedules! -Don't make me laugh! -You think like a station master. -Be polite, Sir. I'm a station master. -And I'm proud of it. -I wouldn't be. Oh, you're finally kind. -Take the next one, it won't kill you. -How do you know? Of course, Lucien left. -They'll think I did it on purpose. -Don't be dramatic. I'll be dramatic if I want to. If it was warm at least. It's fine if your fire starts as fast as the train. It's coming, wait. Wait, of course, that's what a waiting room is for, right? It's a good stove. -It's been here since the occupation. -It's a veteran. But it doesn't work when it's foggy. A veteran who refuses to shoot. It's complicated on a day like this. It's fine if it works well in August. -Nenette! -Ah, finally a girl. Nenette! Nenette! Don't shout like that. Oh, is that Nenette? -I'm not deaf yet. -Your fire is out again. I'm not surprised. So you want me to light it again? If you can, yes. -Well, let's go. -This will take a while. A good job needs time. -Well, I'll go warm up at home. -Of course. If you meet the moonlight killer, tell him to come here. -We have a fire. -The satyr is still at large? How long will it last? The satyr, the satyr. It's not a satyr, it's a vampire. It's not the same. You seem to know a lot about it. A vampire is a man who drinks blood. There's no such thing. When you reach our age, you'll know everything exists. The satyr isn't attracted by blood. You, who knows everything, do you know what an arsonist is? -A what? -An arsonist. A guy who starts fires for fun. So go ahead. I'm afraid of walking home alone, I have to go through the whole park. -I'm too scared. -I'll walk you home, it's on my way. Yes, it's better to choose a satyr you know. Ladies and gentlemen, identity check, please. You'll catch a cold, kids. Come and warm up. -It's okay, I know you. -Yes, we're among ourselves. No Sir, I don't know you. Your papers. You don't know me? What a pity, I deserve to be known. Oh, perfect. On duty until what time? I'd like to know. We've been going non-stop for two weeks. Yes, especially in a place like this. It's not a piece of cake. Do you have a cigarette? The city has nothing to do with it. It's because times are rough. Oh yes, by God. These things didn't happen when I was 20. -We wouldn't have tolerated them. -Oh, come on. Since the Germans left, there are no more manners, no respect. -We have nothing left. -We have something left. -What would that be, Sir? -A satyr. And it's not easy to catch him. It's normal, vicious people use their brains more. Thanks for the cigarette. What a lazy bunch. What could they catch wearing a uniform? All that's missing is a feather on the kepi to be seen from farther away. So, it works better now? Your stove from the dark years works like a charm. Come closer to the stove, Miss. Come… it's warmer. No? There! With this, it will be all red in five minutes. Do you want me to kick your ass? Not at all. Old fart. Old fart yourself. You don't look well, Miss. What's wrong? Leave me alone, Sir. I'm okay. It's wonderful to not do what was planned. Missing a train is as fun as living another life. A life that wasn't allowed. For instance, I missed my train. It almost made me happy. Someone as beautiful and young as you… is not allowed to cry, or you have to say why. In detail, come on. Speak. Take a honey candy. You are waiting for someone, it's obvious. Look. What was I saying? -So he didn't come? -Leave me alone Sir, be quiet. It's useless to cry in advance. -I'm afraid. -Afraid? Why? -He still has two hours to arrive. -You can't understand. If it's about love… I mean, I guess it can't be fun every day. He must have been stopped by a patrol. -What do you mean, a patrol? -Well, the police arrest everyone. They're up to something big. To arrest the satyr. That's why I missed my train. I had to show my papers and talk. Thank God I'm not from here. -Why did you come here? -Well… But you were leaving without luggage? No suitcase? I left in a hurry. Take a candy. Honey will help. Thank you, sir. You're nice. There we go, no more crying. So, tell me more about it. You're not having one? I've already taken two. Hurry up, Gabriel. Give me time to get the suitcase. I didn't ask you to hold the door for me. Paris, first class. Two, please. -11:48 p.m. -It's not 11:48 p.m. It's the only one left. -And the express? -The express? Oh, the Crossbow? It's at 10:03 p.m., but it doesn't linger. Gabriel, you had noted the time, right? Yes, look. Train for Paris, 10:23 p.m. Three, not 23. Congratulations, perfect. Well, I heard wrong. -These things happen. -Of course, they do. 11:48 p.m., it's almost a quarter to midnight. Well. -Oh, no. -What, "oh, no?" -Where are you going? -In the waiting room, obviously. For two hours, are you crazy? We can go back home. -We'll be much better at home than here. -No! Come on, Gabriel. -Gabriel, listen to me. -No! Fine, as you wish. Did you see the weather? It's warm here. And I need warmth. Let's get back in the car. Impossible. I sent the driver away. Every time we're away, he goes out. We'd have to go looking for him God knows where. You don't intend to walk four miles? -I can call a cab. -No, they're not allowed to drive today. We're fine here, I have my newspapers. It's perfect. -So you're staying here? -Yes. But if you want to take a walk, my dear, I don't mind. Now, let me read. Well, I'm going home. Yes, sure. You didn't leave yet? Marcel! Marcel! Idiot. It's warmer here than outside. So you missed your train too. Hey. We kill time as we can. Well. And pigs are so stupid. Oh, sorry. When people want fire, they ask me. Sir. CIGARETTES Excuse me. It has a mind of it's own. Sorry. TAKE THE TRAIN Feeling any better? Madam. Well… Waiting here won't be fun. No, really not. But with this weather, we're better here. May I? A honey candy? Thank you. -But I wouldn't want you to run out. -Oh, I have plenty. For my throat. -You're very kind. -I'm glad you've noticed. It's honey from the Alps, rarely poisonous. What luck. Enjoy. Life isn't very pleasant here. -Life here… -Grim. Deadly. I mean, sure. In a lively city, a satyr would make people laugh. It's foggy. It's making me depressed. They're at least 30 on the night shift, revolver in hand. We'd like to help them, but it's none of my business. Either way, something will happen tonight. Tell me, dear Sir, can we phone Paris from here? Yes, in there, Sir. How does it work? There's a note, you just have to read it and you'll know as much as I do, Sir. Thank you, young man. It's been 15 days that we're a bit lost here. This morning, a dozen policemen dressed as civilians came. Nobody knows them. We don't know how they operate, we're totally in the dark. They swore that they would catch him tonight. Tonight, of course. And who is this person? Do you know? Oh, that one. You know, I see travellers like that all the time. It's unheard of. Everyone's interested in this maniac. Everyone has an opinion about him. Even about his identity. But I don't have any opinion about it. I really don't. And you, dear Sir? Were you talking to me? I was asking you if you had an opinion. Sometimes I do. What is it about? About the maniac, the monster. The one that killed those three poor women. It doesn't concern me. You're wrong. A crime concerns the murderer, of course, but also the victims. Or their entourage. -Sir, let me read, please. -Yes, sure, I was just saying. Look at this. And well-rolled, as I like them. Beggar. Well… When was the first time this guy attacked? About two weeks ago. And since then? He did it again the day before yesterday. For the third time. But according to the gossip. I mean, according to the information. These little things are happening in the city or out of the city? Somewhere in between. It always happens near the overpass. Of course, there's no light there after 10 p.m. And with all these trees, it's dark everywhere. According to you, is it a local guy? Until now, this was such a quiet town. -So what? -So what? We know everyone here! So if there was a vampire… -If there was a vampire? -We would have spotted him. Where's my broom? I hope this train is never late. It often arrives on time, but you never know. Oh, you're here. Did you change your mind? I couldn't walk home. I told you that. But you were right to want to go home. I'm not feeling well at all. What time is it? 10:39 p.m. You'll have to wait a while. But it's not my fault. Can we drink a coffee somewhere? Everything is closed at this time. The public services are really… You have to complain in high places, Sir. I don't have a say in the matter. You're really not feeling well? Not at all. I think I know what it is, but I hope I'm wrong. What is it? Nothing. We're suffocating with this coal smoke. Go get some fresh air. Yes, good idea. The past 15 days, no one has been feeling well here. You should call a doctor. There's no need, Sir. I already feel better. Do you know what a guy like that looks like? I don't know, it's a creature. A creature, what does that mean? It suits you to talk about creatures. I don't know you. You can't talk to me like that. I'm a human being, don't forget that. Sorry, human being, sorry. I was kidding. Who do you think you're talking to? An employee is an employee. Yes, that's all they'll ever be. -My apologies. -What the hell is that good for? Tell me. How do you imagine the satyr? I don't hang out with them. But how do you imagine them? With hair everywhere? Big teeth? Claws maybe? So they're not human. No, we should be allowed to kill them. -Like big rats. -Yes. -Bang, bang. -Yeah, like rats. With a club. -Bang, bang. -Yeah. Bang, bang. I'll tell you what a satyr looks like. I don't want to know. They look like guys like you. With your kind of face. Did you see yours? Leave me alone! I have work to do. I'm not here to listen to travellers' bullshit. -Especially not the crazy ones. -Hey. Stay here. Don't leave. Listen to me. I love my country. Your country doesn't care. Do you love a woman? -Why do you care? -Just to fuck her. Pervert. Have you loved women? Tell me if you've loved women. I'm like everyone else. No, you're not. Women don't like you. They've never liked you, you scare them. Your look scares them. Don't deny it, I know it. Be careful, eh! One day, on a street corner, you'll meet one and you'll jump on her. -I told you to be careful. -And if she tries to run, you'll pull her shoe off, right? Tell me that you'll pull her shoe off. And if she screams, you'll kill her. -And then we'll beat you, like a big rat. -You crazy bastard! We'll meet again. You're a pain in the ass, you're disgusting. And a rude person. What's going on? And be careful what you say. It could cost you. A lot! -Do you do this often? -Me? Never. Stupidity has limits. Come on. Bang, bang. Right? Like rats, right? Bang, bang. Excuse me. My dear, how about we postpone this trip? Tomorrow night, for instance. Gabriel, that's enough. If you're sick, go to the clinic. -You've been putting it off for 6 months. -I don't like that. Nobody does. But at least you'll be properly treated and it will all be finished in two weeks. I told you that you're killing yourself. But you never want to listen to me. You're talking about it casually. You know I'm right. As you wish. Let's hope that nothing unpleasant happens to me. Because I don't know what you can do on a train. Please, don't be dramatic again. -You've been doing it for years. -Okay. As you wish. This trip has been planned for six months. And… it's an anniversary trip. -Did you forget it already? -Oh, no my dear. If you postpone it, it doesn't make sense anymore. Of course, you're right. As always. Aren't you cold? -You don't know me? -No. But I know you. Come with me. Come. That's not true. You don't know me. I do. I know you very well. -I saw you in this station before. -That's normal. Why is it normal? I don't care about anyone but my work. Go on, we're listening. Go and arrest him instead of standing there talking. I'm telling you it's him, for God's sake. We can't arrest people like that. -But I'm telling you, it's him. -What are you talking about? He insulted me. He scared me with his eyes. He spoke to me like a sorcerer. And I know what I'm saying! -It's cold here. -Come to my office. Calm down, come to your senses. But he would have killed me. He would have! I'm telling you. A real sadist. -You know that this train doesn't stop. -You never know. I love trains that don't stop. All these men and women. All their little lives crammed together. It seems like it'll never stop. And the further they go, the prettier it is. Alas. Why, alas? Trains never go far enough for me. A whole world passing by. A world that doesn't interest me. Well, then you never dream. How indiscreet. Yes. Do you dream often? I don't know what you think about or what you're looking for. But if you are a policeman, say so. Especially since you hide it so badly. If you have any questions, ask them. But don't beat around the bush like you've been doing for 15 minutes. It's exasperating. I have nothing to hide. No, we're not on the same page. -Do I really look like a cop? -Why? How do you picture cops? With big teeth and hair everywhere? I'm not asking for much. Why would you ask me that? I don't know how to do those things. I have a feeling that l'm scaring you. -Am I scaring you? -Papers, please. Just you, Sir. Will you do as I asked? -Haven't we seen you before? -Yes, a dozen times. If I were a police inspector, I would ask questions. I would probably ask you some too. But I'm not asking them. I'm not stopping you. What would you ask? Well… I'd ask about your husband. I mean, about your husband's behaviour. Why? He seems strange to me… at first sight. He's never behaved like everyone else. Tonight, he's his usual self. So you see. What do I see? You admit that he doesn't behave like a normal person. He's a war-wounded man. Deaf for 10 years and diabetic for 20 years. He's unable to be normal. I didn't say anything. How long have you been married? Fifteen years, why? So you know your husband well. A little less than at the beginning, like everyone else. I haven't asked myself questions for a long time. Really? Why? It's hard to explain. Oh, go on. Explain. He lives alone in his own world. His factory. His books. And his diabetes. His diabetes. That's not a hobby. You think? It's the most important one. It's his biggest concern. It's definitely his most precious thing. But it's pretty much incurable. Fortunately. If we could cure him, he would die. Yes, of course. Listen to me, Madam. Tonight… is not about illness. Believe me, I'm sure I'm not wrong. How interesting. Your husband is afraid tonight. Afraid? He's sweating with fear. And I know my stuff. I doubt it. Coming from him, that'd be new. Wait. Gabriel. Gabriel. -Didn't you tell me he was deaf? -He has his hearing aid. But he turned it off. He disconnected it. -It's very ingenious. -You think so? It's mostly exasperating. -What do you think he's afraid of? -Well… Madam. Madam, please. -What is it? -Can we talk? Yes. Yes, you prefer to stay among women. -I have something to do on the men's side. -Thanks, Sir. Excuse me. -Yes? -It's from the gentleman from earlier. The gentleman? With the white hair. He wants to see you. -Where? -He told me at the fence. Thank you, Miss. EXIT So… are you feeling better? He turned it off. He won't last long. -What's wrong with you? -Why? -Do you know that guy? -What guy? -What do you mean? -You know what I mean. In the waiting room? -Didn't you understand? -What? -Who he is. -Yes, he's a policeman, so what? -He's trying to get you to talk. -Yes, it's obvious. Then listen to me. If you play with fire for fun, that's your business. But if you do, let me know. Are you afraid? Afraid? I just think it's stupid. But Jean, my darling, have you forgotten why we're leaving? No, but I repeat, let me do it. Don't worry about anything. -I've planned and prepared everything. -I know, but it's too dangerous. Yes, it's not a hunting trip. A husband is harder to shoot than a hare. But we'll do as we said. And that's it. -What if it doesn't work? -Hm. It's risky, but I'm not waiting for you or the money anymore. Is that clear? Jean, do you love me? Don't talk about that tonight. I'm so scared. -And you never know. -What? Your husband doesn't know me. For two years no one has seen us together. We never met in town. -So? -Jean, listen to me. I think I found an easier way. I doubt it. But the guy trying to get you to talk is a cop. -I'm sure about it. -I know it. So, what is he looking for? He's looking for the satyr. -I think it's great, don't you? -Your novels, as usual. But I'm tired of novels. That's enough. Jean, try to understand. My husband would be a good satyr, no? He couldn't exonerate himself. -It's crazy. -Less than you think. We can get through this safely. -You'll ruin everything. -I have to go back. Diane, just a second. Our plans still hold? Idiot. Gabriel! There you are. So, Mrs. Damerville. What happened earlier with my employee? -Your employee? -The one who takes care of the fire. Ask him. What happened with my employee? -Which employee? What do you mean? -Nenette. -Oh, your clown. -He's not a clown, sir. He's an employee doing his job. And you have no right to mistreat him. -I didn't mistreat him, ask the lady. -You called him a satyr. -I wasn't that rude. -Maybe, but you can't say such things. Especially right now. -He doesn't understand anything anyway. -No. He worked for me for 10 years. -And we understand each other. -I'm not surprised. Hey, you there, come quickly. -Do you know what's going on? -Me? Not at all. And I don't care. Anything can happen. -The end of the world if it amuses them. -Yes, that's what they say. Right, go and see. You can tell us about it. Gabriel? Gabriel, do you feel better? We were talking about my husband, weren't we? Oh yes. You're right. You said you had some questions for me. Maybe, I don't remember. Yes, you did, so go ahead. Ask me and I'll answer. -It'll help us pass the time. -As you wish. Let's go. First of all. Does your husband have a lover? One, I doubt it. Several, maybe. Well. -Mr. Damerville, I think… -Yes. I have a question, please. I feel like this train will never arrive. If only it were a useful trip. I've never seen him satisfied with anything. You know a lot more than you're saying. Me? I don't know anything. -What would I know? -Hm. Really? Really? Yes, really. I give you my word if you want. Well… I know a lot of things. -Ah? -Things I'd rather not know. Ah. Here we are. You can't understand. I stayed with a character for 15 years. Because that's all he is, a character. I never knew what was inside. So? We slept together out of politeness. And I had to give him up for what he was. I mean, what he really is. I'm listening. And I don't know anything about him. No more than one of his workers. But I'm the only one who knows something very important. Ah, there you go. He's a nocturnal animal. -He never sleeps, not at all. -Really? -Help yourself. -I already have a candy. I'll take it for the trip. Thank you. He has to sleep a little bit from time to time. At least one or two hours. No. -But, it's impossible. -Yes it is. I tell you that my husband does not sleep. He never sleeps, he has never slept. She had a wooden leg And so that it doesn't show He's only been going out at night for a few months. Alone? I think so. Between 10 p.m. and midnight? Yes. Sometimes he comes home at 4 a.m. With his shoes full of dirt. Full of dirt? And I'm not talking about blood stains on the shirts. -What's wrong with you, are you crazy? -Come on, where do you think you are? -It was time to turn it off. -Step aside Sir, I don't know you. Yes, it's better that way. She had a wooden leg And so that it doesn't show She had rubber washers put under it The chief's office. It'll be fun. -Explain yourself. -Gabriel, please, it's starting to… There we go! You can see much more clearly in the dark to talk. What's going on? The light's out? Little rat… You're in for a surprise, little rat. -If you say so. -Where is the light out? Right here. I'm smarter than I look. And I hear very well when I want to. Gabriel, please. We're in a waiting room at the station. Diane, if you seek to sully and humiliate me… I'm capable of the worst. You know what I mean? Meet me in a few minutes. -No problem, I'll take one of mine. -Please. I really need to talk to you. Yes, of course. -Let's go there. -No, I don't want to. Oh, I understand. Come on. I'm listening, Madam. -I should say everything now. -Yes. Yes, we've already lost a lot of time. You know, even if I sometimes seem rough with him… -I really love my husband. -Yes, of course. But don't you also love someone else? A lover? Are you crazy? That's impossible in a small town like this. Yes, of course. So? As I said earlier… my husband is not an ordinary person. He always worried me. -But lately… -Here we go. Lately? He scares me. I inquired at his factory. -I called. -And what happened? It's not going well, two young girls left. Young girls left? Yes. That's nice, but… it's still unclear. Please understand, Sir. -It's difficult for me to… -I know. I know, but it's difficult to step back. Do you have any proof or specific information? It's now or never. Isn't what I said enough? No, unfortunately. Over here, quickly! Quick. Quick, tell me. -One night, I hid to wait for him. -Well. -Not long ago. -And? He came home in a frightening state. -Exhausted and pale. -Yes? -He didn't expect to find me there. -And? I asked him some questions. He confessed everything. Oh, perfect. Well… so. It's really nice. Go out that way, I'll go out the other side. I have to keep cool now. I think I have the right… Big rat. Where did you come from? Don't touch me, Gabriel. Don't touch me. We'll talk about this on the train. The animal is in the station. We've been chasing him for 20 minutes, but we lost him. So he runs fast. Yes, he does. -Are you sure it's him? -Well, he was running. Oh, of course, if he was running… -Who is he? -He is… So nobody saw anything here? -What about the baggage room? -We'll know soon, Marcel is there. So he went that way? No, this way. I've been screaming for 15 minutes. But they never believe me. He tried to go through the luggage, he ran into the employee and left. Come on, quick. Where are you going? Why do you care? I'm just asking you where you're going. -You'd better listen to me. -Mind your own business. -Be careful, I know a lot. -You do? Well, good for you. Now, leave me alone, please. You shouldn't take it that way. Come, quick. Oh, my god. Mr. Damerville. It took him by surprise, right Madam? He screamed and fell on the floor. Well, he just passed out. Sugar. Sugar. Quick. -It looks like he wants sugar. -Yes. Does anyone have any? -Sugar? Why? -My husband is diabetic. He took too much insulin and needs sugar right away. This gentleman has candy. -Ah yes, the cop. -He's not a cop. -What do you mean? -No. Gentlemen, don't just stand there. Go get some sugar. Where would I find sugar in a train station at night? -The nougat. -What nougat? Nougat is sweet. Even sweeter than sugar. -Do you have some? -I think so. -Go get it, then. -Quick. Hello? Lucien? Is that you? Tell me… No. I'm still there. Yes, I missed my train. It's fine, I'll take the 11:48 p.m. one. No, don't worry. I didn't waste my time. The miracle I was telling you about has just happened. Robert is on duty? Perfect. You have to come, quick. Trains go much further than we think. Especially when you miss them. Don't worry, I'll get the spotlight. I'll have my big moment as you say. My trick worked. The candy jar trick. Yes, and it worked like a charm. To the max. All right, see you in a minute, buddy. TELEPHONE Do you still have candy for my husband? Oh no, I don't have anymore. -I thought you had plenty. -Not anymore I'm sure I didn't eat it. I don't like it. Wait. In there. Here it is. Get out of the way. Nougat from Montelimard. Go on, give him your nougat. -Mind your own business! -It's not nougat, it's disgusting. Are you crazy? It's hazelnut nougat. It may be hazelnut, but it's disgusting. -You'll pay dearly. -Dearly? Yes, you'll pay dearly. -Sir, leave him alone, please. -And you'll pay soon. Give him one of my candies. Force it into his mouth. Look over there, on the tracks. Come over here. It's all I've found. What is it this time? -Did you see my colleague? -What colleague? From Paris. A bearded man, from France Soir. -He just called me. -He called from France Soir? -No, from here. -Oh, he must be on the docks. Thank you. I'll leave this here for a minute. All you had to do was to keep your mouth shut. I wonder if you don't do it on purpose. -Listen… -Enough. You're always scared. You have no right to say that. Okay, I was wrong tonight. But it was worth a shot. -I wanted to save you… -Save me what? Save me from causing an ordinary train accident? Then why did you organise this trip? You could rig his insulin. Or poison him nicely. Bourgeois families do it and no one cares. Whose idea was this trip? -You or me? -Yes, I know, Jean. We could be happy together for the first time. Together, without having to hide. Especially since in a way, we're not killing him. -We're doing him a favour. -You're exaggerating. No, and you know it. Why must this satyr case interfere with our plan? -It's grotesque. -Not really. I didn't tell him my little story for no reason. It wasn't such a dumb idea. But now they have the satyr. Or they will soon. That cop will wonder why you told him that. Yes. Especially since he's not a cop. What do you mean? Do you like honey candies? Honey candies… -Did he offer you any? -No, why? Do you know what a microphone is? A hypocritical ear that wanders from mouth to mouth. So what? And do you know what a tape recorder is? It's a garbage can that keeps track of anyone's ramblings. A garbage can or a candy jar. Is it clear now? That bastard we thought was a cop is a journalist. -And that box he's got in his pocket. -Yeah, I noticed it. These are all our conversations. And they can appear in their gossip papers tomorrow. But who told you that he's a journalist? The girl. Who you seemed to be interested in. Diane. Answer me. We should have shot right away. -You've got the wrong man again? -Mind your own ass. At my age? You know there's still a train? I know, give me a minute to roll a cigarette. Diane, answer me. What did you tell that bastard about me? -What would I tell him about you? -Maybe that I'll kill your husband. On the train, like that. To make us some pocket money. -You're talking nonsense. -And you? -You told him that he killed a woman. -You're hurting me. Let me take care of it. We need those recordings. -I guess he's on the same train as us. -Probably, but it doesn't matter. It matters a lot. You've made a fool of me. Excuse me? I'll have a good laugh when the judge questions you. Let's talk about it on the train. Are you taking the same one as us? -You'll tell him that you have no lover. -Yes, so what? No, just asking. You'll probably also tell him about this gentleman. -I'm just saying. -I've told you to mind your own business. Yes, I'm thinking about it. But she's right. It's very hard to kill someone. Even a war-wounded man. And even on a night train. What are you playing at? I'm not playing, I'm working. Well I suggest that you take some rest. -It'll be good for you. -But be careful, there are many cops. You might regret it. Your attention! The train to Chaumont, Bar-sur-Aube, Troyes, Romilly, Paris is announced. Oh, there they are. You're wrong to try to outsmart me. Nobody has ever succeeded. And this gentleman's no exception. I've known this gentleman for two years. Really? You're playing hide and seek. Your friend is looking for you. Yes, I know. I saw him. -You're a journalist, right? -Yes. Oh, here's what we've been waiting for. Journalists are all mad. Excuse me, but this is your train. I hope it hasn't been too long. Travellers to Chaumont, Bar-sur-Aube… Oh, you're alone. Where are you going? SMOKING If you're looking for your friend, don't worry, he's right behind us. So, how are you? -I'm fine. What about the stove? -Oh, it never works. Oh, station master. -It's not me. -You jerk. I'm asking you where he's. I won't tell you if you call me a jerk. So, did you find your friend? I didn't see him get on. This time he won't miss it. He would even jump on it on the move. He's a professional. I'm very happy for him. -Why? -Because he did the right thing. -Go on, let's go! -Goodbye, Dad. Laurent! Laurent. Laurent. Bastards! They took his tape recorder. -What is this? -A shoe. Yes, I see. He called it his piece of evidence. Call an ambulance. You promised me. Uncle Jérôme, I beg you, be careful. You'll end up getting arrested. I'm Auvernaux's station manager. Yes, Mr. Perrin. Let me talk to your boss. Hello? I need an ambulance. Immediately, I'll explain. Yes, it's urgent. Yes, I'll explain. Probably an accident. THE END
