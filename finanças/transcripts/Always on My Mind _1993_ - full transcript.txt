Haven't you noticed? But you told me not to ask you... When did you start listening to what I say? I'm talking to you! I asked you to take me on a trip, you never did. I asked you to let me go get a job, you wouldn't let me. Women don't have to stay home and cook all the time Am I right, Adam? Right. Men should take care of their wives, right? Well, I think... It's none of your business. If you'd just look around There's a million things you can do at home. Why you still look for a job outside? You have heart disease, my dear Who's going to look after you if you faint? Should it be your boss, or should it be me? Will you think about it? Do your folks fight often? What? Mom's playing her trump card. I understand you perfectly. Husbands should respect their wives. Besides you've been taking care of the house... ...For so many years. It's time for you to get a job.

Where do you live? Don't you have a karaoke at home? I just came back from the States; I'm waiting for my girlfriend, My family makes me... I can't do anything about it. I don't have a chance. Don't you know? It's very hard to get into Hong Kong University Tell you what, I promise I'll call you every night. Hey... what do you mean by that? Oh please, let's not get into that. I really love you very much. I'll jump off the roof. Hello... Crazy. Hello? Hello? I have to pay the gas bill tomorrow. I almost forgot that I really think you're a genius. What is your brain made up of? What does paying the gas bill... Has to do with your son thinking of killing himself? You're just crazy! Talking to you is just... Do you mean we should stay up all night... And take turns watching our son? He's a big boy now! That reminded me. Turn off the gas in the kitchen right away. Go. Turn them all off. Get a move on. And put away all the knives too. Oh yes, that's right. How about shoelaces? Window handles, glass bottles, chlorine, insecticide... Leather belts... Glasses... Buttons... Drapes? Yau-wai, Yau-wai. Hurry, hurry. Is that Sze? Yes. Oh heaven forbids. Keep your paws off her, punk. I'm going to chop them off, He's molesting our daughter! What're you shooting? It's our daughter's first kiss. Then zoom in all the way. That'll be evidence when I bring him to court. What's your problem? You got all worked up because your son got dumped. Now your daughter's in love and you aren't happy either. What do you want? I want to get some sleep. Really? Can you? Stop groaning, stupid dog! Don't even think about it. Chung, Chung. Chung. Look at him. He's been walking back and forth like that for a long time. Oh God. Let's wait and see. Maybe we should call the cops. No. Too many people may make him jump. Don't say that word. I'm scared. Calm down, calm down. Let me talk to him. You... Let me talk to him. Don't worry; it's going to be okay. Daddy. Thinking deep thoughts up here? And all by yourself? No. I just want to be by myself for a little while. Ha, you got that from me, didn't you? When you've spent all your life thinking by yourself, There's very little that you can accomplish on your own. You won't find the answers 99% of you questions. You have to talk to someone. Let's talk about it. Come on, come over here. Can we just talk here? Sure, anywhere you want. Chung, you'll be going to Canada very soon. Are you upset about leaving home? Upset about leaving mom? Upset about leaving me? Upset about leaving your friends? Or upset about leaving your girlfriends? Dad, you're my father. I can't talk to you about these things, don't you see? Chung, you're not backward, are you? These days' people talk to DJs for three whole hours... Oh, I'm so lonely. Total strangers, and in public. Make believe I'm a DJ. Hello, who's calling? Chung. Is that right? You got a problem? You want to tell me about it? Well, tell me. Dad, you're a lot older than I am. You won't understand. That sounds familiar. Who said that? Now I remember. That's what I said to grandfather. That's what I said, "You won't understand, You're older than I am, you just won't understand. But that didn't make any sense. Since he's older, he should know more and understand better. Why didn't I think of that? To this day I don't have the answer. Dad. It's Angela. The one who goes bowling? No, the one who plays tennis. She won't receive my calls, And she keeps ignoring me. Dad, is she dumping me? Of course not. I would say it's you who's dumping her, Now listen... Yau-wai. I'll be right back, wait for me. Hurry up. What's the matter? We just started talking. Sze said she's getting married with Adam. Don't just stand there, go talk to her. Some girls, when they get to a certain age, They'll imagine they have an impulse to get married. But it is entirely false. Dad. I'm not being impulsive. I've known Adam since Grade 7. Where did I get the impulse? Listen to me! I saw what he did yesterday and I know him! You may not want to think about it, But I do, okay? I do. It's a false impulse. No, no."... I was talking to him about love everlasting... Good times and bad not withstanding. Things like that. I was on Genesis, About how the dumbest things that fool Adam did... Was to be coaxed by that Eve and ate the forbidden fruit. You just go on with the story. Did Sze taste the forbidden fruit with Adam? What? Let's say it's the first time you went to a restaurant. There's no reason to say it's such a great restaurant... And you'll be eating there for the rest of your life, And you'll not eat anywhere else. It's just not fair. If I were you, I'd try at least ten, fifteen restaurants, If not a hundred restaurants. Actually the best idea is to try all the restaurants in Hong Kong. And if you still think this one is the best, Then you make your commitment, And stay with this one for the rest of your life. It's me who's getting married, not you. All you talk about is you marrying dad. Okay. We won't talk about me getting married. Let's talk about your dad getting married. Why did he get married so early? Because he thought he was getting old... Your son asked me which restaurants had I gone to before. What have you been talking to him? I can't remember. It's your turn to go upstairs. Dad, let me make my own decision. I'm a grown man. I'm a grown woman. Good, our children have grown up. That means youth has slipped through our fingers, And we have become old. Speak for yourself. You're not old. Of course I'm not. Yesterday Customs raided... A bootleg factory in Yau Tong, And disclosed an amount of bootleg liquor worth around $90,000. They also discovered on the premises various equipment and ingredients. In this operation, Customs officers... What's wrong with him? I don't know. What do we do now? Mr. Chang, are you alright? You take rest. Peter, replace him. You have 10 seconds. Are you okay? I want to be honest with you. I want to fire you. No, I should say the company wants to fire you. Just because my tummy ached... During the broadcast And you're giving me notice? Everyone has a price. The company doesn't think you're worth yours. Mr. Poon, last month the other station offered me twice of what I'm getting here. I wouldn't even speak to them. A few days ago, Two weekly offered me three times as much to be their editor. I didn't even take a look at their contract! So I don't worth it? Why am I staying here? Because I like this station, And we have had a very good working relationship. I don't worth it? Look at the last thing I did. I gave you my very best, everyone saw it. You tell me if I'm worth my price. Look at Tiananmen. If I didn't risk my-life and held on to the camera, Do you think you'd get these pictures? I gave my life for it! Mr. Poon, you tell me if I'm worth it? Look. I respect you. And if you don't think I'm worth my price, You tell me how much I'm worth, you name a price. Mr. Poon, your tell me. I'm a loyal person, And I'm destined to stay with this company for the rest of my life. The White Dragon God in Thailand once told my fortune, He said I have a benefactor; and his name is Poon. Mr. Poon, what is you last name? Poon. What a coincidence. How about this one? I don't want it. Wow! So expensive. Don't be silly, you'll find yourself a wife. Look at your dad. Now he's a smart guy. But in those days, when he got dumped, he just went to sleep till the next norning, He bought some flowers and ran after another girl. That's sportsmanship! You ought to learn from him He doesn't cry over spilled milk. In the end he got himself a good woman, right? Yeah, you're right. But I can't do it. Chasing after skirts, that's just not me. We're talking about emotions here. It means responsibility and commitment. That's true. That's really good. You're a loyal person. You're not like all those people, messy. You're like me, loyal, single-minded. But it's' really tough. Look at me; I've suffered for 20 years. Oh, no wonder you weren't practising your tennis. I'm going to school in Toronto pretty soon. Really? I'm transferring from Vancouver... To Toronto next semester. Really? Apple, we have to catch our movie. Alright. I have your number. I'll call you tonight, bye. Your father, what's his family name? Apple. Don't you have to go home and check if you have any messages? He's got new hope. What new hope? Just look at him. I'm going out. Not staying for dinner. Hello, hello, the phone, please. Oh, yes. What's his hurry? What new hope? Dad, I am a good sportsman too. Sportsman? Smart boy. What sportsman? Sportsman. You always say you're a good sport man You always tell me what a good sport man you were. I was? How? Mommy. Come here. I know where I came from. The foreign kids told you, right? Well, tell me. No. That's childish. Our in-laws would-be here today. We picked the date and fixed everything. We have an agreement. Come, take a look. What agreement? Did I say yes? Are they loaded or what? How much are they offering for dowry? Will you stop being so mercenary? It's a pretty sum. I don't care how pretty it is. I'm not selling my daughter. Yin, do you understand? Go talk to Sze. Ask her to name a person in Hong Kong... Who gets rich playing the guitar? No. Tell her... They'll end up like me here: Crouching on the pavement with a mug. You're always on my mind Living on the kindness of strangers. You are always on my mind. Sitting there, waiting for hours on end for the copper... That might not even land inside the mug. And you'll have to go on all fours, Pick it up and put it inside. Sad, isn't it? Well, Sam Hui is pretty successful. You go talk to your daughter. She's right! Right about what? I have good news. I've found a job; I'm starting tomorrow. Wait. Our daughter just told me she's getting married, And now you tell me you're going to work? Yau-wai... Are you alright? You're all leaving me! What about me? Can you not take the job? It's a very good job. I can keep myself physically fit. I can make money. It's only two hours a day. And people will respect me and admire me. You doing a concert? Doctor, can you repeat that again? Sure. The last time you had your check-up, Your blood test, urine test... No, what I meant was... Can you repeat your very last sentence? My last sentence... Yes. You might have cancer. Doc, if I really have cancer, And if you so happen made the correct diagnosis, How would you rate this 'if'? This 'if... I would rate it at... Approximately 0.01%. That means unlikely, right? As much chance as winning the Lotto. Right. He told me the possibility was one tenth. No. He told mom it's one eighth. Let's eat. He's back. Wai, let's eat. What are we having? Let's eat. Since everybody's here, I want to make an announcement. Yesterday, I went to the doctor. He said I have a small black spot in my intestines. There's a possibility that it might be cancer. But he said he wouldn't know for sure until the reports come out day after tomorrow. I pressured him, And he said at the most the chance is one fifth. Well, let's eat. One fifth... Mommy, I want soup. Are you not eating? Wait a second, I may die! And you're eating like pigs. What does this mean? Well, you've always been kind of hypochondriac. Two weeks ago your eyes hurt, And you thought you had cataract. A couple of days ago your stomach ached, And you thought you had a heart condition. Last year you said you had a 50 It turned out to be a false alarm. Dad, whatever you say, Adam and I are getting married. I'm full, You guys are calling me a liar, aren't you? Yes, Let's eat. You said the reports are coming out in three days, right? We'll discuss it after three days. It's not that long. Doc, can you repeat what you just said? The test proves that it's not a possibility. It's a fact that you have intestinal cancer. Doc, that was too brief. Can you please repeat what you just told me, slowly... And from very beginning to very end? Okay. I have very important news, But I don't want you to get upset about it. About this X-ray... Your intestines have started to get inflammed. And it affected... Well, it's great. It's just great. No more worries about... Your wife and your kids leaving you one by one; And no more worries about your boss telling you: You don't worth your price. You don't smoke, You don't drink, you don't fool around, You'll die of boredom anyway. Now the good Lord beckons you, Go, keep him company: It beats eating oranges by yourself, With a head of white hair. Right? But wait a minute. This good Lord, he's never called me before. I don't have to answer his call. Maybe he got the wrong number. That's it. He got the wrong number. Calling me? No way! I don't have to answer his call. No way! It can't be wrong. Your friend's got cancer. Bring your friend to my clinic, Let me give him another check-up. But if it can't be wrong, Then why should I bother with another check-up? Will another check-up reverse what's right? You don't know a thing! Cancer is not necessarily incurable. Some people go through the motions: Injections, medication, electrotherapy, operation, etc. Still they die. But some people do nothing and they recovered. That's what I thought. So, do you think my friend has got chance? I don't know. Doc, go ahead and tell me. I can take it. How much longer can I live? Let me think... About three months. What? Is that not enough? Let me think again. If you get an operation as soon as you can, You 'may still have a chance, but... That's okay. You don't have to comfort me. I'm an optimistic guy. I already got what I wanted in life. I can make it to Andy Lau's concert this month, right? Next month is Aron Kowk that should still be okay. And then Jackie Cheung, That's pushing it a bit, eh? Who's this? A new guy, don't bother. Can I help you? Do you take credit cards? Credit cards? Hi, dad. Going swimming? Wait for me, let me get changed and go with you. No, I'm going to play tennis. Good. Let's play some tennis. Wait for me, I want to get changed. I'm meeting a friend. Ask Apple to have dinner with us. OK. You're-meeting a friend? Are you going somewhere? One of the kids in my class is having a birthday party. If I don't show up, no one will come to my classes in the future. Yin, can I go with you? You look terrible, Are you sick? What's the matter? Come inside, I have something to tell you. Yin, are you okay? What did you say? Lately, my heart has been pumping like crazy. It could be the pupils, they drive me nuts, Does it happen a lot? What were you going to say? Nothing. It can wait. Yau-wai, your dinner is in the microwave oven, Are you making calculations? I'm checking it. It's not functioning. We should really make some calculations. The boy is going to college overseas, And the girl is getting married. We should redo this house before the wedding. A lot of people will be coming, you know what I mean. Besides, it's time to get a new car. What? Let's buy a Mercedes, enjoy life while we can. What do you say? I like it. But do we have the money? We can rob, plunder, steal... Be unscrupulous, by hooks or crooks. Mommy! I know where I came from. You do? Well tell me. It's not that violent. Wrong again? What are you two talking about? It's our little secret. Another one of your secrets. I got to go. Your check-up report, what does it say? What report? The one that said there's a one-fifth chance of you getting cancer. The doctor scared me. I'm okay. Really! The kids have grown up. Quit telling them these stories, they resent it. Sit! Are they kissing again? Sze? No, I don't see them. It's almost 12 o'clock, and no one's back. What's the big idea? You're so dated. Young people these days, they go out on a date... And come home before daybreak, we call them good kids. You can't keep the children by your side for the rest of your life. You have to learn to be independent. What're you writing? Are we going on a trip? No, you said we had to redo the house. I'm writing some articles for a travel agent... To make some extra money. Why don't you ask them for two air tickets instead of a fee? And let's go to the Caribbean. You want to go on another trip? I thought we went on our honeymoon. I'm so glad that you remember. Hello, yes. Okay. Roger. Right away. Okay, thank you. What is it? You're not going back to the station, are you? Going on a remote. Don't stay up for me, you get some rest yourself. But you never went on remote! For an extra paycheck. Go to bed first, okay? Who are you? TV news. I'm a reporter, I'm sorry. It's a pretty big scene. What's going on? Should I call the station for an OB van? Go right ahead. Yes. Understand? Yes sir. Action! Yes sir! Commander Lui, you got quite a set-up here. What's the action? We have 4 armed suspects inside. They have submarine guns, hand grenades, 7.25mm; It's an arsenal. I know you have a job to do; just don't mess up. And don't forget that... If anything happens to anyone of us. It's our own responsibility, right? The latest model! Can I have one? Well, thank you for your help. We know what to do. Quick, quick, quick. Get out of the way! Move! You three go that way. The four of us go in. I'm just a news reporter. I'll kill you! Found anything? No. Spread out. I know you're a fake. You're a genius. The tape's stucked inside. Look at the camera, I don't know if insurance will pay for it. Be careful! The tape inside is very important. I wonder if it's still good, Hi, Chang. That was some impressive shit. You guys got all the first hand stuff. Come on, give us some info. Mr. Chang, your coffee. Let him get some rest. He's part of the story; he caught the bad guys. Just a coincidence. You? You're kidding me. C'mon, don't give us this bullshit. The commander is here. Peter, you're on, 5 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The raid was a complete success. After three months of investigation, Our triad investigation unit... Joined forces with the task force... And carried out last night's operation. According to our information, The suspects had put up strong resistance... And broken through police lines. What was the situation? The suspects did resist, But they were soon neutralized by our officers. In other words... How come he didn't mention Chang? Maybe it's all boloney. He's an old man. Commander Lui, I have a question. I heard the suspect was arrested inside the Treasure Trove, Would you like to comment on that? That's all for today. Other information will be released at a later date, Thank you. The suspect inside the Trove was knocked unconscious by Mr. Chang, Then your officers put the handcuffs on him. Shut up! What're you trying to say? He should count himself lucky that he was alive. He wasn't asking for credit, was he? But that's the fact! The fact is he shouldn't be there in the first place. Do you want me to tell the people of Hong Kong... That he has arrested someone on the most wanted list? The police will lose face! Our officers will lose their morale, Do you understand? But Commander Lui, what about the morale of my boys? You guys just deliver the commentary, We go out and put our lives on the line. Are you trying to be a hero? But I'm afraid no one will believe you, You got a point. Mr. Chang, one minute and you're on... To tell the viewers what happened last night. Nah, all people believe is specious speech, Mr. Chang, look, I got the tape! It might playback what happened inside the Trove, Good. Let me do the reporting. Take it back to the studio, And tell them to standby. This is going blow them away, Okay. If you're going to take the responsibility, I don't see a problem. Did you get the signal? Got it. Line it up. Mr. Chang, 5 seconds. 4,3,2,1. At 4 am this morning, The police laid siege to the amusement park. At 4:10, the Tactical Unit arrived. Then I heard a round of AK47 gunfire, Followed by three explosions of hand grenades. I remember very clearly, it went like this: bam, bam, and bam. After the explosion, the suspects made a run for... He called that news? The man's doing a show! It's been chaos, absolute anarchy! By sheer coincidence... A cameraman and myself were right outside of the Treasure Trove. And I subconsciously... That's right. That's the word, I subconsciously... Excuse me, Mr. Director in the control room... I am not finished yet. Take your hand off the button. That's right. Much obliged. So I walked into the Trove. What a coincidence! One of the suspects also came into the Trove. I was already very scared, Then the whole gang came in, followed by the police. They started shooting at each other. Bullets were flying, and hand grenades exploding everywhere. I was so frightened. I threw myself on the ground. I didn't move a muscle. And then... I know you're not going to believe me. There I was inside the Trove, and I didn't want the bad guys to find me. So I disguised myself as a puppet. But the suspect, fearing that the police might find him, Also disguised himself as a puppet. So you have one puppet straddling another puppet, And he had his hands on my throat, he almost suffocated me. You're not going to believe this. An entire police unit walked passed us, And they didn't notice anything. I thought I was going to die. But somehow I got hold of a false arm, And knocked the bad guy unconscious. Now please enjoy the footage Well done! Chang, well done! We paid you to be a newscaster, not a talk show host. I was telling the truth. A newscaster tells the truth. The truth is the police commissioner called our boss, And asked us to review our code of practice. And there's another truth. I got your check-up report from the insurance company today. You've got cancer. So you think since you only have three months to live, You can say whatever you want on TV, And cook up all kinds of bullshit, is that what you think? No, I never thought about that. Forget it! I want you to hand in your resignation letter in 15 minutes. After that, I don't want to see your face ever again. This is it. Let my secretary know where and when you1re having your funeral. I want to send you a wreath. If I really thought I was going to die and I could say whatever I damn well please, The first thing I'd say in front of 6 million people in Hong Kong would be... To tell you to go bugger yourself. Andy Lau! Can I have your autograph? I'm not Andy Lau. Don't pull my leg. I'm not crazy. Please. You've 'got the wrong person; I'm not Andy Lau. I didn't. You're really great, you caught the bad guy. Please give me your autograph. If I sign it here, you'll just throw it away. No, I won't. I'll put it into my stomach. Into your stomach? No, you'll just throw it away. No, I won't. You're wasting my time. Please... Daddy. You're early. Mun... Daddy, did you catch a thief? Oh right. It's really quite funny. Her schoolmates and their parents kept telling me: Your husband's really great, he caught a thief. So I said, "No way, it must be someone else." Were you bullshitting again? Did you catch him or not? Some of it. Well, it doesn't count. Hurray, I won five dollars. I knew it wasn't you. She made a bet with her schoolmates that it wasn't you. Mum... Daddy, What're you doing up there? Looking for toilet paper. For whom? Go cheer mommy up, she's crying. Why is she crying? She was talking to two men, and then she went into the garden and started crying. What men? Mr. Chang, Mr. Poon and I came to visit you. So soon? I'm not dead yet. I give you face. Leave my house before I count to three. 1... Mr. Chang, please listen to me: 2... A lot of people called the station to compliment you on your reporting. We'll double your pay. Why're you all of a sudden so nice? A man who's end is nigh speaks powerful words, I want everyone in Hong Kong to know that you've got cancer. Then every word that comes out of your mouth... Will become the most trustworthy news. Our ratings will go up. Please come back, I promise you great freedom. You can say whatever you want, anything. Daddy, aren't you going to cheer mommy up? I'm going. What did you tell my wife? The truth. Later, when you see me point my finger, what do you do? More naturally, Mr. Poon. Okay? Thank you. Yin, Mr. Poon said they're staying for dinner. Do we have enough food? What do we have in the fridge? I have to make you turtle soup, But I didn't get around to buy turtles. What're you doing? What's going on? I don't have cancer. They made a mistake. Please don't lie to me. Don't be silly. You're not going to believe what happened. Listen to me. The doctor sent them someone else's check-up report. They thought it was mine. It's a mix-up. I don't have cancer. You're being foolish. Ask them, go ahead, and ask them. Do I have cancer? You can tell from their expression. So it really was a misunderstanding? But the company thinks instead of correcting the misunderstanding... We should exploit the situation and make the best out of it... Can you repeat the last sentence? The last sentence... meaning... That I admit I've got cancer? No, the one before that. The one before that, Giving me a 100% raise. The higher the ratings, the higher my salary. We're going to be rich? That's what I thought. No, we can't do that. It's cheating. No, it's not. You know, the big shots of the company, they aren't human. In other words, they'll do anything for higher ratings. They don't have a trace of humanity inside them. Do they? So you're not sick?! I think I'll do it for three months, And make us some money. Then we can consider immigrating, or traveling around the world. But that would mean we're scrambling for money. Well, what does it matter? Everyone in the world is scrambling for money. Those singers, they say they're retiring, Wait till you turn around, they're out there singing again. And those actresses, saying how they'd never take off their clothes again. How long does it take for them to go all naked again? Even the American president, remember, "Read my lips"? The minute he got elected, he raised taxes. Everybody is scrambling for money. It doesn't matter any more. But they all blame it on "circumstances". Circumstances, my foot! Only we are the real victims of circumstances. Our daughter's getting married, Our son is going to school overseas. We have to redo our house, buy a new car. Where does the money come from? We are the one who really have no choice. We've got to take our chances, don't you think so? Mr. Chang, half an hour before you go on air live. Shall we go and get prepared? I'll be right with you. See you. Wait, did you say a 200% or a 300% raise? 300%. Yes, 300%. If the response is good, There'll be weekly adjustments. Yes, adjustments, adjustments. Well, go on, get to work. Be careful. Mind your steps. What do you mean mind your steps? This is my house, Are you happy with that? Thank you, everybody. Thank you, brothers and sisters. I suppose everyone knows that I've... I've got what I got. I hope in the upcoming three months... We'll all give the company our very best. We'll get the best ratings... And break all the records in Hong Kong, okay? Mr. Poon also said that for every point in the ratings, We'll get a 10% raise. How's that sound? On behalf of everybody, let me give Mr. Poon a kiss, okay? Mr. Chang, what are your opinions on what happened yesterday? I'm very sorry. I admit I did get carried away yesterday. But I do find unethical news reporting absolutely intolerable. I just had to spit it out. Also, we're very sorry to learn that you've got cancer, That you have only three months left, is that correct? Yes. Three months, is not a very long time. But I want to give the audiences my word that I'd do my very best... To bring you the most trustworthy news... Until my very last breath. Did you see that? I never knew your dad was such a good actor! But dad is lying. I won't say that. Maybe just a little bit. He has his difficulties. There're outside circumstances. So does dad have cancer or not? Of course not. Cancer is serious business. You don't joke about cancer. I don't know about you people. Hello, Apple? Okay, hang on. Mom, telephone. Thank you. Hello, cousin. Did you watch the news? Wait a minute. Let me get back to you. Cousin, Cousin, It all happened so suddenly, We're terribly distressed. The whole family is just terribly, terribly distressed. Congratulations, Mr. Chang. You're very brave. Mr. Chang; this way please, please... How're the cucumbers? They're good. Let me have two of them. Take them. Go on, take them. We've been neighbors for so long. We've always respected Mr. Chang. If anything happens, just don't get too upset. You don't want my money? No. Take the cucumbers. Mrs. Chang, turtle soup can cure cancer. These are for you. For me? Yes. But they're expensive. It's okay. We're neighbors. Well, thank you very much. That's okay. Don't mention it. Good evening. I am Chang Yau-wai. I'm very happy to be back here to bring you the news. Locally, An investment company in Central went bankrupt. 300 clients claimed that they had been taken in, There were 5,000... As a matter of fact, I think these investment specialists. They may not even make $3,000 a month. Yet they gleefully use other people's money to invest, I mean hundreds of thousands of dollars. And tell people they can make tons of money. Are you going to believe them? If they can make that kind of money, Why would they invest for you? Don't be a fool. News from Beijing. The Sino-British talks show no sign of reaching an agreement... A lot of people called to complain. But even more people called to compliment. Just look at the ratings. But the ratings... All of you stop arguing. Leave us. There's no room for personal opinions in news reporting. If this goes on, the government may revoke our license. I'll fire Chang Yau-wai right away. No. Let him talk. The audience love him. I want to raise our ratings; I don't care how we do it. The police raided a number of karaoke bars in Yau-Tsim district yesterday, And arrested several hostesses suspected of prostitution. Girls, think about it. Why would anyone be so generous? Why would they give you 10k just to sing with someone? And you believe them? Use you brains, girls. They want you as prostitutes! Keep going. You do your best to distract her; our officers will do the rest. Does it have to be me? I think our negotiators scared her. She said she'd only listen to you. She asked for you. Come on, please. Fong Siu-man, were you looking for me? They wouldn't let me watch Andy Lau concert. What? Why wouldn't you let her watch Andy Lau concert? We only wanted her to get good grades; That's why we wouldn't let her watch Andy Lau. Nonsense! Siu-man doesn't go to school for the two of you! We don't go to school for our parents. You people are ridiculous. You think we go to school for our future? There may not even be a future. We may get run over and that's the end of it. Right? I totally agree with you. Andy Lau has a song that goes something like this: Gonna have a real good time, What's the next line? That's it. I don't need you to watch over me. Right? Let's sing together. C'mon, its' okay. 1,2,3. Gonna have a real good time, I don't need you to watch over me." Good. One more time. 1, 2, 3. Gonna have a real good time... The second line; 1, 2, 3. l don't want you to watch over me." Mun... You have a visitor. Daddy. Cheung Chi-... The word is too small. Cheung Chi- what? Cheung Chi-Leung. Mr. Cheung, how're you? I am a filmmaker. I have an idea for a very sincere movie. We would very much like Mr. Chang to take part in it. I wonder if I can have a few words with you? I just came back to change my clothes. I'm going out on a remote right away. Please have a seat. You're Mr. ...Cheung? Right. Thank you. What's Sze doing? Adam's inside. What's he doing inside? They're discussing their wedding. Did I say yes to it? Your daughter's mad at you. Go talk to her. Talk to her about what? She said she's getting married and she's gone ahead with it. Why didn't she come and talk to me? Sit down with her and talk to her nicely. You're her mom, you go talk to her. Go. Sure I'm her mom, but aren't you her dad? Why are you always depending on me? You go talk to her. Tell her that I'm her father and I work very hard. Don't forget that. Why're you so crabby? Daddy, are you mad? No. I'm a good kid. I didn't tell anyone... That you lied. Oh yes, don't tell anyone. Today the whole class got detention except me. The teacher let me come home to be with you. That's very nice. Daddy, you're great. You're great too. Mommy's mad too. Go cheer her up. Mommy, please don't be mad. Please smile. Mr. Chang. Come in. I'm sorry. A robber is holding someone hostage. He said he wanted to speak with you. That's the job of a specialist negotiator. But the robber's also holds the negotiator hostage. Okay, let's go. Cut! Was that an OK? Yes, take a break. I told you not to come, go home and get some sleep. How can I sleep? How about the kids? They're all asleep. I made you some soup. You haven't been getting much sleep. There's water here, you don't have to do that. There's something you have to do for Mun. Her schoolmates want your autograph. They want my autograph? In the center: You look terrible. Well, it helps, I should look terrible. This won't go on for long. Oh yeah, another month and you'll be dead. I've done some research. The fastest is to immigrate to South Africa. Besides, no one knows you there. Yin, I just remember. Starting tomorrow, I want you to be my manager. I'd like to have you around. Be my manager, you know. Like the Big Fours, they all have their managers. You want me to be your manager? Okay? Starting tomorrow. But you'll have to go to confession with me tomorrow. We've been lying to a lot of people. I'll forget to go if it becomes a habit. If only I had started drinking Yasasu sooner. Director. Do I have to sigh that many times? Yes, and put some feelings into it. If only I had started drinking Yasasu sooner, I wouldn't be worrying now. If you want to live long and stay young, Drink Yasasu! Okay. Camera ready, real take. Excuse me, director. Hold it. Is anything wrong? I'm sorry. He has to go on a campaign trail for a Councilor, There's not much time left. When will he be finished? Don't worry. We're right on schedule. Okay? Thank you Mrs. Chang, I've lined up another commercial. I'd like you to do it. You're very photogenic, Me? Sure. No, I can't. I really can't. Why not? C'mon. No. Yes. When? We'll talk about it later, okay? Okay. Real take, camera ready. Mommy, Daddy didn't come back again last night. I haven't seen him for three days. You can see him on IV. Mommy, my uniform's all wrinkled. It isn't properly ironed. Will you knock it off? Mommy. Stop kicking me. Mom, when is dad coming home? Apple said she wanted to meet him. Can you make an appointment with him for dinner tomorrow night? So the wind's started to blow the other way. Good. Mommy, my uniform is all wrinkled. Mr. Chang, injections can only suppress the symptoms. I advise surgery, and the sooner the better. I know, but I may die on the operation table. Give me some time to think it over. Hello... can you hear me? Do you want me to wake him up? He's not seen you for days. Let him sleep. Adam and I are going to Macau for two days. What? Honeymoon before the wedding; I suppose this is hip? Do you know what she wrote? She went with this guitar guy to Macau to have some fun. What kind of fun? Poker? Or is it Black Jack? You're her mom. You should keep an eye on her. How can I? I have a million things to do! How can you not! Starting from tomorrow, you do nothing but keep an eye on her. I don't need you to be my manager any more. It's a disaster! It really is. You just blame everything on me. Do you think I enjoy it? Going everywhere with you and lying to people. Aren't you already exhausted? What're you scribbling? It's a thousand dollars a page. $1,000 less isn't going to kill you. But I'm dying. I mean they think I'm dying. It's now or never. I still don't think it's right cheating people like we do. Hello. Mr. Lo, yes. There shouldn't be a problem. It's okay. Yes, good. Let me talk to you about it tomorrow. Thank you, thanks very much. Good, no more scribbling. I just made another $100,000. How come? Mr. Lo said the other station has a beauty pageant next week; Since we don't have a program to match it, He suggested holding a "Pre-Death Birthday Party" for me. I asked him if he was insane. And he said $100,000. So I said that's a sure sign of sanity, and I accepted. So, no more scribbling. Let's go to bed, Just don't ever let me see that guitar guy again. But your birthday is in next month. They're not going to throw me in jail if I celebrate a few days earlier, are they? After Mr. Chang has cut the cake, You put the necklace on Mrs. Chang. But it is my birthday. Why should I give my wife a necklace? It's the sponsor's idea. Whatever. So this belongs to me after the show? Only the chain. The diamond goes back to the sponsor. It's typical. Sorry about that. Such stingy people. Do you like it? It's okay. Hello, auntie. Sze. Hello, auntie. I couldn't find her anywhere; I think she's left. That's okay. Bye now. Sze, are you really not going tonight? You'll be on TV You can go first. I'll lock up tonight. Okay? Okay. Bye. Bye. What's that? Put it away. What? It's eye drops. You'll be crying your heart out to jerk some tears from the audiences. Just in case... I don't need it. You won't. I don't have a problem breaking into tears. Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Chang, 15 minutes before the show begins. 1s you daughter going to show up? She's on her way. Mr. Chang, are you okay? What is it? It's my tummy. I have to go to the bathroom.

And now we want to thank St. Dancers Bakery..." For preparing for us this "Cake of Death," To congratulate Mr. Chang on his ascendance to other realm. Mr. Chang, will you please cut the cake? Mr. Chang, Who demonstrates great courage and dignity in the face of death, Has filled our heart with admiration, We're so happy... This isn't real. My parents don't drink; they're allergic to it. It's probably cream soda. Cream soda is props; it isn't real. Isn't it sparkling! I never saw my dad dance. He can't dance, Your parents they are okay people. Yeah, Hong Kong people they are kind of greedy. Are you saying my parents are greedy? No, that's not what I meant. I was just... Saying it. My parents are not greedy people. And now Mr. Chang, a toast and a speech. Mr. Chang, please. Truly silence is gold on this occasion! People are just terrible! This is not a public toilet! You're home? Mom, look. Was the traffic heavy? It's kind of late. Show it to your dad, see if there's a misprint. Dad, take a look and see if there's a misprint. Are we going to cancel the wedding if there's a misprint? I'm going to bed. She didn't even greet me. Oh, come off it. Time's up. Ready? 1,2,3. Bum... It's not in the kitchen. Will you stop playing and come help me look for it? Okay. You can wear mine.

If you'd agree to surgery, there's still hope. Yes, uncle... Dad, there's a 50/50 chance that you'll be okay. That's right. Listen to me. A 50/50 chance means... Excuse me, Mr. Chang, we're running out of time. Hang on! We still have time. ...Half a chance, Which means half of it is already gone, do you understand? That's enough. Go to the peak, go go. But the more you procrastinate, The more you run a chance of not making it. Can't you see? C'mon. Don't do that. People are watching. Now come on, 1, 2, 3. 1,2,3,3! You let dad think about it. I'll give you an answer tonight. I promise. Okay? Take the doctor to the peak. And show him the Sucker's Pagoda, Okay? Bye. Bye. Goodbye Ms. JJ. Daddy. How pretty! Dad... Isn't that a pretty bicycle?

If you won't see me, will you miss me? Of course I will. Well, just remember, If you don't see me, You just think that daddy has immigrated to American or Canada, Like all those uncles and aunties. That I've taken a plane, and zoom, gone to a place very far away. Daddy, can I go with you? You have to go to school, how can you? Can I call you long distance? Yes, but that's very expensive. Let's not make those calls, okay? I can sell my bike to Fatty, Then I'll have money to call you. But it's still too expensive. Don't call me. Whatever you're thinking, daddy will know. You don't have to call me, I'll know. Do you understand what I'm saying? What are you doing? Fixing the lightbulb. I've been working on it for 3 weeks, Do it tomorrow. You've got to go to work. I might not have a chance tomorrow. Is this a new suit? No. Don't you remember? I wore this the first day I became an anchorman, Really? Don't you remember? You made the alterations. Oh yeah. No wonder it looks so funny. They never get up on the first call. That's okay. Let them sleep. Sit down with me, Let's skip the children, Today it's just you and me, Just the two of us? We never had breakfast by ourselves, I want to... What're you doing this afternoon? I'm going to the hairdresser's; I'm meeting a director, He wanted me in his kung fu movie. Now that's a joke. Come back early. Let's have dinner by ourselves. Okay Just the two of us? Are you alright? Something's bothering you, What did you say? Something's bothering you. No. What do you think is bothering me? Something's bothering me? Are you alright? Just come home earlier, okay? I've got to run. I have a few things that I want to take care of. We'll talk when I come back. Bye. Wait, wait... I know what's bothering you. There's something wrong with your suit. It's too old-fashioned, Now that's better. People will die if they see you reading the news like that. Now that's much better, isn't it? It's not bad... I think so too. Damn, only 15 minute left. No one answered the phone at Chang's place Maybe he fell down on the street. Mr. Poon, it's almost time to go on air. Should we find someone to fill in for Chang? What news do we have for today? Mr. Chang. The same old crap. You can watch it on the other stationn. Why bother? Only five minutes left. We don't have anything else? The old jerk just wants me to go out and bullshit, I'll say something. Put on a show. Don't worry. Mr. Chang, why are you so late? This is going to come out of your salary. Mr. Poon, this is my resignation letter. Kindly accept it. When you have time, please add up all my benefits, and my pension too. Thank you. Chang Yau wai. Tonight is my last tango. Last what? Tango! Mrs. Chang, the news. Your husband is cracking jokes again. He's not cracking jokes. He's bullshitting, Good afternoon. This is Chang Yau-wai reading the afternoon news. First we have news from this station. Five minutes ago, I submitted my resignation. I can't stand being used and exploited any longer. As you all know, three months ago, When our executives found out that I've got cancer, They launched a series of promotion campaigns. The purpose was ratings. As a result, I became immensely popular. And I was interviewed days and nights. But ever since I found out that I for sure have got cancer, I've never been able to accept it. I've been a newscaster with this station for over ten years. There're just too many things that I'm not sure about. For years I talked about Paris, but I've never visited the Eiffel Tower. Does it actually exist? Has it gone rusty? Or has it collapsed? For year I talked about Japan, But I've never been to a hot spring. Is it true that they have women massaging your back? They should have it, right? But a lot of people say: You fool! They don't have it! What can I say? For years I talked about the Great Wall. Have you been there? I haven't. Is it really great? Did you measure it? I didn't, I don't think anyone did. How do we know if it's really great? The world is made up of hearsays. There're so many things that I'm not sure of, Yet I'm telling you about them. And you believe me. You believe what I told you? But I'm just saying them! In this world, nothing can be sure or certain. But there's an exception. At five o'clock this afternoon I'm going to have an operation. So tomorrow when you wake up, open your eyes, And turn on the TV, You may find that I no longer exist. There may be someone else sitting here... Reading the news. He maybe skinnier than I am, And he may part his hair in the middle. He'll be reading his news, And you fools that you are, will believe him. You'll lap it all up. Did you ever think that he might be pulling your leg? Maybe it's all a lie. He isn't sure himself. Maybe he's just like me, colluding with the station. I for a little money, And the station, for ratings. And together we fooled you. It's that simple. How come you've never noticed? I think the world is like... what kind of a world is it anyway? Whatever people say, we agree and repeat; Whatever TV shows, we watch; whatever the newspapers print, we believe, Whatever our idols wear, we wear; And whatever commercials sell, we buy. It's all so simple. We have no style, we just follow what other people do and say. We don't use our brains, we listen and believe. One person wears jeans, everyone wears jeans. Does this world have nothing else but jeans? You say: Hey buddy, what do I know? How can I tell? It's none of my business. You talk, I listen. Sure, you can say that. You're the media, we believe you. You sit at home, you turn on the TV... Whatever you say, I believe. I don't know shit! Bullshit. You got brains. You can't just rely on your eyes and ears. You hear something, and you think about it. That's all I've got to say. And that's all for the future. Right now, what the most important thing in my life? If we meet again, or if we don't meet again, remember... Hey, don't do that. C'mon, let me see you smile, Cheer up, let me see you smile, C'mon... Where're you two going? I'm Chang Yau.wai's daughter. Okay. Where's mom and dad? I don't know. Dad told me pick up Mun from school and come here. Is yours sweet? Mine's pretty sweet. Yes. I withdrew all my money from the bank this morning... And transferred it into your account. Do you remember? The passbook that you wrapped inside a white hanky... Under a plank on the right hand side of the wardrobe? When did you find out? About four years ago. The red one? There's a red one? The one I saw was green. Where is the red one? The one you saw was green? The red one is in the 2nd drawer of the shoe cabinet in the kitchen... Wrapped inside newspapers in an ice-cream box. I knew you're sneaky. Now eat it. Hiding two passbooks. Which one has more money? Be frank. The blue one. A third one. You have three? That's something. In the future, use your money wisely, you understand? Finish this one first, it's hot. The day before yesterday I bought two cruise tickets. This is the best tour. It goes direct from Hong Kong to the Caribbeans, Your favorite place. I've worked it out with them. Listen to me. If there'll be no misunderstanding, If one of us can't make it, They will refund one ticket, that's $28,000. Don't be silly, not again. Why don't you go with me right now? Forget about the operation. Go with me now. Listen to me first. Remember what you once taught me? That I should be independent? Let's go together. 1,2,3. Everyone can survive and live on their own. It's only a trip. What does it matter? If you need someone, you can always pick up a guy on the way. Don't be silly. Smile. 1,2,3. Look at this beautiful cruiser. Didn't you say you love fishing in the Caribbeans? Don't you remember? You go with me, let's go together. We're going together. C'mon. Look at the view, and the sea.
