Woman: This is wpku, where all New York meets to talk. Joey in queens... Randall: Wzin, the liberated voice of African American New York. Jody from Brooklyn, speak to me. Randall, we gotta talk about cops hassling African American males. I was on... Man: ...My Yankees are playing unbelievably! Tino Martinez-- last year, he's like a bum. He does nothing in the playoffs, right? And now, all of a sudden, he's like babe Ruth... Woman: What are they thinking? You know, people don't get up at 7:00 in the morning on the weekends! Why can't they do it...? Man: ...They're scared of ebonics 'cause they think it's just for black kids, but what I'm here to say is that there's as many white kids out there speaking like they're from the streets as there are black kids. Man: It's bad enough in the city. You can't even order a hamburger without talking Spanish. Now they want to make up a new language? How many of these kids are...? Woman: ...When the city feels that they have the need to do construction during rush hour. I mean, like, how stupid is that? Man: ...When TV shows do stuff on deadbeat dads, it's always about white guys. How come they don't go after them black men that get all those 12-year-old girls pregnant, huh? How come they only chase guys who had bad marriages, and lay off guys who never... Man: ...Fanatics, and that means you've got to be committed. We've got a team here that has three pitchers that are on the d.L.-- three multi-million-dollar pitchers that are on the d.L. Woman: I can talk now? All right, well, listen... Man: I got laid off, Dr. Osgood, so my ex goes on some daytime talk show, and they say she ought to haul me into court. So she did! So I go down to court, and they've lined up 60 guys like me. And they're white guys! Woman: I understand what the problem is here. It's stupidity, that's what it is! They're wasting money... Wzin, you're on the air with Randall Marcus. Man: You don't get to say anything about the mets. Just keep your mouth shut, 'cause this is the team of destiny. This is the team that's gonna go someplace, and when these guys come back and the nucleus of the thing, you know, comes together... Woman: Those black girls probably don't know how to use the system to go after the fathers. Man: Or maybe they're scared to try, huh? Or maybe they're scared to try, yes, but the deal also is, Joey, that you still do have kids. What you gotta look out for is them. What's race got to do with that? [ Overlapping shouts ] Two!

Hey, yo, you see what's going down on TV tonight? I'm a radio man, kwame, and until there's a liberated African American television station, I'm stayin' that way... [ Overlapping chatter ] 'Morning. Jim Sullivan, Manhattan district attorney. I have... I have a statement to read, after which I will take a limited number of questions. Like all decent new yorkers, this office is horrified by last night's brutal beating death of an innocent woman. I intend to see justice is done. N.y.p.d. Have detained four suspects, and we're evaluating the evidence to determine if charges against the suspects are warranted. Now, questions? Man: Knock if off down there! No passing of anything except documents, and no touching. Thank you so much. I might have forgotten. I'll be watching. Sam lind, your court- appointed lawyer. So, have I got a case here? You're the lawyer. Why you askin' me? Oh, a wild guess. You're the crew chief. 50 bucks says I'm right. [ Overlapping chatter ] As I said, we're still evaluating the evidence. Yes? If you do press charges against those in custody, will you ask they be tried as juveniles, or as adults? Well, miss, uh... Linda Chang, channel 3 news. Well, Linda, I haven't seen any paper on these people. For all I know, they areadults. Yeah? But if they're not, what then? I'm not in the speculation business, but you can rest assured, we'll do what's right for the law-abiding citizens of this city. Yeah? So you intended to steal a car. Why did you hit her? She pulled something on me. I thought it was a gun. Self-defense, my man. I'm not your man, and self-defense won't apply here. Huh? Murder committed during the commission of a felony is culpable, whether it was intended or not. Do you understand what I just said to you? Yeah. We in deep shit, right? Yeah, deeper than you can imagine. Shit, man! Yo, man, cut that faggot crap, man! We in this together, a'ight? Whatever, man. We gonna fry together too. Well, not necessarily. You're juveniles, and I haven't heard all the details yet. So, tell me, did you cover yourself? Bet your ass I did. Actually, the stakes are yourass, not mine. So speak. Mr. District attorney, sir! Pete. Are you sure you've got jurisdiction here, Jim? Of course. The crime happened on port authority turf, the victim was from Jersey. Did you discuss this with the d.A. Across the Hudson? Not an issue, Pete. The suspects are new yorkers. They're already in our custody. This is the right office to ensure the full measure of the law is enforced. You sure of this? Come on, man, I'm telling you, I ain't no fool's fool. All right, tell me one more time. All right, man, blue threw me up against the car. He then started to feel me down. I said it wasn't there. He then starts messing with me. I ask about my lawyer. He asked where it was. I say-- I nodded at the car, and he found it. Simple as that. And thenthey read you your rights? Like I said. Aw, man, come on, look at me, man! They treated us brutal! That was there at the time of the arrest. Fuck. They lie. Then explain the broken windshield. I-I must have hit it with the gun when I was trying to get in the car. Ohh. Like I said. D.a. Sullivan will now wait for more evidence, but he's clearly sickened by this crime and won't rule out trying the suspects as adults. Oh, he will try them as adults. That right-wing bastard would just as soon hang 'em in public without a trial. I want this one. This case belongs right here in New Jersey. Now, what do your friends across the river tell you? That it's an open-and-shut case, tailor made for Sullivan: Four black kids caught red-handed. Public opinion wants a quick conviction. If he can deliver it, he will be off and running for mayor of New York. Not if I can help it. This case belongs in New Jersey. Oh, no, see, fighting over a sure case is bad p.R. It-- it stinks of trying to out-tough Sullivan on crime. Besides, I hear they got the weapon. Mm-hmm. Kids weren't even smart enough to dump it. Mnh-mnh. Sullivan's got this one. Not if I can help it. These'll help you sleep, and here's a prescription in case you need some more. Oh, I don't need that. Sorry, sir, hospital regulations. In case you fall and sue us. [ Scoffs ] Just... just do it. I could guess what you're thinking. Mr. Gainer, my heart goes out to you. Kids today-- well, it's not like when I was coming up. I say no punishment's too hard for those kids. Randall: We got Dee in Newark. Speak to me. Randall, word on the street says that these kids were nowhere near that woman! Cops just saw a car... Look, can I get out of this? Not yet, sir. I'm gonna go get the car. Oh, Jesus Christ. Look, wait, wait, wait. Get him out of here, all right? Get him around the back. Hold it. If you have any questions, ask me. I'm his lawyer, all right? Linda Chang, channel 3 action news. Do you think d.A. Sullivan should try them as adults? I'm not here to outguess the d.A., all right, but a woman was savagely beaten to death in her own neighborhood by four males rampaging in a stolen car. They had no reason to be where they were. Can you confirm they had no reason to be in New Jersey? I mean, don't all Americans have freedom of movement? Not in a stolen car, they don't. Thanks a lot. We feel the executive branch is obliged to seek jurisdiction. For political reasons? It's one that we do not want to get away. Why? Well, surely it's obvious. A horrible crime occurs on part of the interstate system-- the very type of crime that this administration is accused of being soft on. And we need to be seen as proactive in prosecuting this kind of violence. It's so transparent, and I don't approve of the white house micromanaging my department. Do you? Well, my opinion is irrelevant, and, frankly, so is yours. We both serve at the president's pleasure. ♪♪ [ Telephones ringing ] [ Indistinct chatter ] It's in all the papers. It's a circus, al. It's all one big circus, and we are the trained seals that do all the entertaining. This... This is a terrible thing. It's-- it's a horrible death. But we had four dead that same night: One o.D., two gunshots, and a suicide up on 160th, and not a word in these! Not a drop of ink to waste, or a second on TV! What's the word out there? Lots of sorrow for kameel and his family. They're decent people. Shawn Taylor and Rodney pass aren't the smartest kids. They probably didn't even know what was going down. Now, as for Kenny Johnson, folks that knew him all figured he'd get himself into a mess like this sooner or later. But nobody did anything to help, did they? The cops kept busting him and letting him go. That's all the system cared about. Nobody put out a helping hand to the boy! So now who's to blame for the mess he's in? [ Sighs ] Well... Better late than never, huh? Time for some community action. Is there a lawyer? Sam lind. Are we happy with that? He's always did right by folks like us in the past. He's a good lawyer. [ Sighs ] For a white boy. No. No! I want those votes! Okay, what do we got? The court's appointed a public defender, a guy called Sam lind. Sam lind! That ought to make it easier. He's stuck in the '60s. He's not hip to the new media. He's trying to slow things down, delay preliminary hearing. Judge? Letasha winslow. Shit! We know where her sympathies are. A fuckin' deadhead liberal! In the black community, she's considered tough. No disrespect, Danny, but their idea of tough isn't mine. Pass on preliminary. Go to indictment. Anything else? The one we think is the leader, Kenny Johnson, has got a rap sheet longer than your arm. Starts with armed robbery at age 12, eight felony arrests by the age of 14. Great. More reason to try him as an adult. What about the others? One kameel whelan, has no record. The other two are run-of-the-mill stuff-- a couple of misdemeanor convictions, one felony robbery. [ Sighs ] This kameel kid might be a problem. See what you can find on him in the neighborhood. I don't want these kids to get away with an adult crime! What else? Yeah, uh, my buddy from Harvard, the one who's interning at justice, he tells me Gordon's lobbying to get jurisdiction away from us, but,says my friend, the Attorney General's office is also sniffing around on their own account. No surprise. This is just the kind of easy case liberals die for. Shows their tough on crime without getting reverend ed walton up their ass. Harder for him to accuse them of playing politics. But that's exactly what they'd be doing! Well, this time let's us be the guys who win it back from the thugs, so move fast. By Monday, I want us so far down the road, it'd be too late for anybody else to grab jurisdiction. Go! [ Indistinct chatter ] It's your sister. Betty? No. It's your sister. Norm. How is he? Is he okay? I think this is what they mean by "denial." Hey. Mm. I heard your car. I thought it was Betty. Must be nuts. You think? No, no, no. Of course not. It's only natural. Yeah. So, uh, any luggage? [ Indistinct chatter ] I'm sorry, dad. I'm real sorry. I'll just bet you are. The trouble is, it's too damn late! Dad, I never touched that woman.

Look, I know our neighborhood is hard on you, but everybody in the world has a job to do. Now, your mother and I, we scratch hard to make a living. Your job is to take full advantage of what we manage to bring you. Now, that is the deal, and you're not living up to your side of the bargain! Dad, I never meant to be trouble to you and mom. What you meant and what you did are two different things! I messed up, dad. I know it. What do you expect,
