[gentle melody] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. - Hey, sis. - Hey there, sis. - Oh my goodness. Look at this. This brings back such memories. - I know. - Oh my gosh. I cannot believe you're moving back in with dad. - I know, but it's just temporarily. I wasn't gonna sign another lease or go month-to-month. - Okay, well why didn't you just move in with Norman? - Because I already told you, we aren't gonna live together until we're married. - Okay, Faith, seriously, you guys are getting married in four months, it's not like you're not over there every single night. - Yeah, but living together is different and besides, this will be fun. It'll be like a little retreat before I become the old ball-and-chain. - Like old times, right? - Yeah. Move, you're messing up my clothes. - What? - Come on. I folded them up. - Oh my gosh. Oh gosh, remember how mom was. We'd have to come up here every Saturday morning and fold clothes. - I know. - [Hope] Remember that? - And then we couldn't move or go outside until every single piece is finished. - And there'd be like four baskets, one with socks, one with shirts 'cause she was so anal. - [Faith] Oh my gosh. - Oh my gosh. - I still miss her. I miss her, too. I can't believe it's already been 12 years. - I know, it seems like last year. - Have you noticed dad lately? How he's been I don't know a little weird? Although, he gets this way every time mom's birthday is coming up, but he's just been really like jumpy and weird lately? You notice that? - Yeah, I noticed, but I think he's acting weird 'cause he's dating someone. - Excuse me? Wait, wait, wait, wait, what are you talking about? How do you know? - Well, he doesn't know this, but Norman and I were out one night and we saw him eating dinner with this woman. - Well, how do you know it wasn't work? - She reached across the table and held his hand. - Oh my gosh. - Why are you so surprised? - I'm just, I-- - He's been alone for a long time. - I know, I'm just shocked that he didn't tell anyone. I mean, he didn't tell us. - Well, don't say anything. Just wait until he says something. - Okay. Fine. - I have someone. Dad has someone. - [Hope] Oh no. - When are you-- - Stop. Don't even finish that, stop it. - I just want you to be happy. - Excuse me, Faith. I'm sorry, since when does a woman's happiness depend on having a man, okay, no. - Because it's how we breed and ultimately it should be our goal. - Are you serious? Do you hear what's coming out of your mouth right now? I'm sorry, I didn't know this was 1940. Okay, let me go out and find myself a nice righteous man before I shrivel up and die. - Come on, Hope. Look, it's not the end-all-be-all. I mean, I'm not even sure I can have kids, but you, you're perfectly healthy, you should definitely think about having a family. - I know plenty of women who are married with a truckload of children and they're miserable. - That's because they married the wrong man. - Well, you know what, enough about marriage talk, okay, unless it's about you and Norman, I don't wanna talk about it. - Okay? - Okay. Fine. - Good. What she look like? - Who, dad's girlfriend? - Oh, now it's his girlfriend? - I don't know, I mean, she's pretty. She has a cute smile. Long hair and I think it's hers. - Whatever. - [Faith] Well, at least, it looked like it. - Wow, okay, well, go dad. So, how about you, how are you feeling? - I'm okay. I mean, I've been having some pains in my legs. I think it's just from stress. - Are you taking your vitamins? - Yeah. - [Hope] And your meds? - No. I mean, I haven't had an episode in over two years, so I thought I might be getting better. - You are getting better, sweetie, but you still have to stay on top of this. - I'm going to the doctor tomorrow. - Well, I'm gonna talk to Norman and make sure he helps you manage all of this. - No. No, no, no, just don't say anything to him, please. - Why? - Just don't. - Oh my goodness. You haven't told him, have you? Faith, you haven't told him, why? - It just never came up. - You're getting married to this man in four months and it never came up that you have sickle cell? - I know. Come on, don't look at me like that. I knew that I needed to say something, I just liked him and kept liking him more and more and-- - You have got to tell him. All right, I mean, you're getting married to this man soon and you've known him for 12 months, you have to tell him today. - Today? - Yes, today. - No. - So, okay, help me understand this, so what was your plan? You were just gonna get married to this man, then you just planned on waking up one morning and you're really, really sick and you just say, "Hey, oh hey, by the way, I forgot to tell ya, "I have sickle cell?" - You don't understand what it's like. What if he-- - What if he what? - What if he leaves me? - He's not leaving you. - Steven left me. - Okay, well, Steven was a jerk, Norman loves you, and he's with you, and he's not gonna leave you. You tell him. And you tell him today. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi, daddy. - Hey, pop. - Well, looks like old times. - So, heard you have a girlfriend. - [Faith] I told you not to say anything. - Faith said that she saw you-- - I said that I saw you out with a young lady-- - A woman who was holding your hand and other things. - Girlfriend? I might be dating a woman. - Okay, so, come on, so who is she? She have a job, what does she do? She take the bus or what's her story? - All right, dad, are you happy 'cause that's the most important-- - No, no, no, no, no. What's important is that some gold digger isn't trying to hoodwink our poor defenseless father. - Poor, defenseless? - I mean that in a good way, daddy, I just wanna take care of you. Come here, love you, daddy. - Love you, too, and hey, I'm good, Hope. I'm good. - [Hope] Okay, good. What's her name? - Eve. - Eve, huh? Eve, okay, well, we'll be checking that fruit before you eat it. - Okay, enough already, dad, enjoy yourself. - I do, what are y'all doing for lunch? - Well, Norman was just getting back into town, so we were supposed to hook up, but-- - I'm thinking Eatzi's. Haven't done it for a while. - Eazti's, I love Eatzi's. - One of your mom's favorite spots. - [Hope] Mom used to love it, yeah. - Yeah, Eatzi's, let's do it. - Well, I'll just see if he can just meet us there. - All the better. - All right, have him come with us and maybe your girlfriend will wanna come with us. - You know what, why don't you meet me downstairs because we have something to talk about. - So, what does she look like? - [Dad] Manners. - She have a nice smile? Oh, no, manners is you telling someone and not us having to find out by accident. [upbeat melody] - [Faith] Sweetheart. - [Norman] Oh, that was so good, I'm so full. - I'm so glad you came with us. - Anything for you, babe. I'm just surprised you ate all that food. I mean, it was enough for two. - I know, I normally can't finish one meal. I guess my appetite is changing. - You trying to tell me something? Are you trying to give me a hint? - What, what are you talking about. - I'm just saying that I know what you're trying to say, you gonna have a little Normina? - No. I'm not pregnant. - You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - You know, I ain't gonna be mad. I'm gonna be a good daddy. But now, look, I'm saying, I mean, being pregnant, is it that bad? - Yes, Norman, it is, we're not married. It would hurt my father and I wanna do things the right way. - Okay, I mean, I'm down with doing things the right way, but you know, we are getting married in a couple of months. You know, I wanna start working on a family. - Why so soon? - I mean, why wait? I mean, I ain't getting any younger and I do wanna enjoy my kids. - Well, as I've said, I wanna enjoy being a husband and wife before we start a family. - Husband and wife. That sounds so good, man. Little Norman, Little Normina. - Do you think we're ready? - Ready for what, babe? - Ready for marriage. - What are you talking about, of course I do. - Well, we've only been dating a year. I mean, we've been engaged for a few months and now it's time for a wedding. - What you talking about? Are you not ready? Babe, what's going on? - I just think we're moving really fast, that's all, and you keep talking about having kids. What if I can't have any kids? - You can have kids. - You don't know that. - Babe, relax, you're fine, I'm fine. I mean, we're gonna have perfect little children. - Children. As in more than one? - Yeah, we talked about this, remember? I wanted three, you wanted two, and we agreed that after the second one that we would see if we wanted a third one. We talked about this. - I have to go. - Seriously, like you're really about to leave right now? - Yeah, now that I'm staying at home, it's just weird if I stay out all night. - But it's still kinda early, babe. And your dad, come on now, your dad don't care. The man even said, "See you tomorrow." Tomorrow as in you staying home with me. - [Yusuf] Yo! - I though Yusuf moved out. - He did. - Hope I'm not disturbing you. - [Faith] Hi, Yusuf. [speaking in foreign language] - What you doing here? - I need a place to stay tonight. - Well, why didn't you call? - Sally's gone. - Gone? - Broke, not working, I just don't have it, I just need a place to crash. - Are you okay, Yusuf? - What's wrong with y'all women? - Tangie's pregnant. - Oh, wow, congratulations. - It's not mine. - Oh. What? - [Faith] Sorry. - All this time, we had a long talk last night and she finally came out and told me. - Man. - Sneaky, man. That's so sneaky. Y'all try to blame us for sneaking around, come to find out y'all do the most dirt. Why can't y'all just be honest? - 'Cause it's not that easy. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, so what you saying? You taking Tangie's side? - No. - Hold up, you knew about this? - No, no, I'm just saying. She probably couldn't tell you for some reason. - Some reason, what reason? I'm always there. For a whole year she's been seeing somebody else. - Well, you have been stringing her along for eight years. - I'm not ready. - Hold up, so he's supposed to marry her because he ain't ready, but she is? Come on, babe. - No, I mean, I guess not. I mean, but that's probably why she found another man, thinking you would never be ready. - So then why didn't she just break up with him? - Exactly, why didn't she just do that? Y'all women lie so much y'all don't even realize when y'all doing it - Why are you fussing at me? I didn't do anything. - Sorry, I'm just upset right now. - Okay, I'm gonna let you two talk. - Whoa, wait, wait, wait. You know, we gotta finish our conversation? - I know, later, go talk to Yusuf. I'm going home so just call me later. - All right. Man. Sorry. - [Yusuf] No, I'm glad I found out before we got married. - When was you getting married? - Soon, about five to 10 years from now. - Come on, man, you ain't changed since high school. You don't know how to commit then and you definitely don't know how to commit now. - What are you talking about? - Come on, man, in high school, man, you couldn't even commit to a sport, you had to play three. - I was good. - You couldn't even commit to a college, man, you had to wait 'til the next semester. - I was weighing my options. - Man, you went to the prom with two girls. - I was being a genius, man, I'm smart, you just hatin'. - Whatever, man, listen, you just can't commit. - [Yusuf] At least I wasn't cheatin'. - She probably thought you were. - There's nothing wrong with dating somebody long enough to really get to know who they are. I dated Tangie for what, 10 years, I just found out she's a trifling chicken head. To prove my point, you need to take a page out of my book. - What? - You've only known Faith for one year. - Man, I've known her longer than that. - Okay, an year and an hour, I mean, what? - Man, you starting to sound like her. She was just in here talking about we was moving to fast. - She got another man. - What? - Dog, she need time to end things with him before she marries you. - Faith does not have another man. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Come on, man, Faith is just proper, she doing the Christian thing. She cares about what people think. - Well, this person thinks she moved in with daddy, so she could still spend time with Tyrone. - Who is Tyrone? - Her other man and she probably went to go see him right now. - Oh, man, please, you just mad. - Yeah, I'm mad, but let my anger be a lesson to you. Women are like oak tree, shady. - No, man, I ain't even listening to you. Man, I ain't worried about Faith, you know what I'm saying? Faith is all about me, all about me. Hello. Hey, baby, where you at? I don't know why you ain't answering your phone, I don't know if you busy, you with somebody, give me a call when you get a chance, all right, I gotta go, bye. What you doing back there, man? - [Yusuf] Yo, we shootin' pool? - Hey, man, who told you to eat that? - What, you was gonna eat this? - Look, I know you going through a rough evening, but you still don't live here. - I know, we shootin' pool or what, man? - Look at that, ah. Yeah, man, come on, let's go shoot some pool, but we gotta stop by Faith's house real quick, I gotta tell her something. - She just left. - Yeah, I know, I know, I just gotta tell her something real quick. - You just wanna make sure she's not with Tyrone. - Man, no, I'm not, now come on, let's go, eating all... - All right, but she better be there. - She'll be there. - You sure? - I'm sure. - Fully dressed? - Man, listen, come on. - [Yusuf] With her head not messed up? - Listen, man, stop getting me upset. [Hope laughing] - Let me call you back. Hey, whoa, whoa. Where's Faith? - Tyrone, dog. - Shh! - What? - Tyrone, your sister's other man. - What are you talking about? Faith's not seeing anybody else, what's going on? - Look, your sister was with us an hour ago, she said she was going home. - Okay, well, she's not here, did you call her? - She's not answering her phone. - Do anyone see what's going on around here? - Hush up, Farrakhan. - Hold up, don't make fun of my religious belief, I don't do that to yours. - Okay, oh god, Norman did you come by here to check up on her? - Luckily for us, we did. - You know what, I bet you put him up to this. You know what, I feel so sorry for Tangie. - Hey, don't feel sorry for her. - Look, we are not gonna talk about that right now. Will you just do me a favor? Can you just tell her I came by? - Yeah. - And tell her to call me 'cause she's been acting weird, it's not like her. - [Hope] Weird, how? - Acting like we moving too fast and saying that we really don't know each other. I mean, it sounds like she's trying to postpone the wedding. - Well, Faith just hasn't been feeling well lately, so just be patient with her. - What, where you been, young lady? - What? - Are you okay? - What are you guys doing here? - I thought something was wrong with you earlier, so I figured I'd stop by to check on you. - I'm fine. - [Hope] You know what, Yusuf and I are gonna go into the kitchen, you guys need to talk. - No, I'm good. I need to hear this. - [Hope] Yusuf, kitchen. - Look, I'm fine, Norman. I didn't need you to come and check on me. - Are you not ready to get married? [somber melody] - Look, I don't wanna talk about this tonight. - We don't have to talk about it. Just answer the question. - Do I wanna marry you, yes. I just have to think about a few things. - A few things that concerns our marriage? I need to know what's going on. - It's nothing. - Is it someone else? - There might be. - There might be? - Look, can we just please talk about this tomorrow? - [Norman] Yusuf! - [Yusuf] What's up? - Let's go, man. - [Yusuf] You all right? - Please tell me you told him. - Just stay out of this. - Faith, you're gonna ruin everything. I mean, seriously, what happened this afternoon? Where'd you go? - Nowhere. - Oh, so now you're gonna lie to me to? - Look, just stay out of this, Hope. - God, it's just so... - What's going on? - Nothing. - Nothing. - Why are you here, you moving back in, too? - No, I just came by to check up on Faith. Oh. Oh, well, well, well, who do we have here? - I'm Eve. - Oh, Eve, Eve, well, I'm Hope and this is my sister Faith. - Nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you both. - I'm not staying. I just came by to pick up my bowling ball. - Bowling, wow, okay, daddy, that's cool. - Okay, dad, we can go get your ball. - Yeah, I didn't know anybody would be here and I thought that you were gonna be out with Norman, Faith. - Well, I was, but I didn't feel well, so I came home. - Everything okay? - Yeah. - No. - Yes, everything is fine. - [Dad] Okay. - Go get your ball. Go ahead. - [Dad] Be right back. - Eve, sit down. - Thank you. - Do you want something to drink? - Oh, no, I'm good. Thank you. - Beer, wine, hard liquor? - I'm not a drinker. - Oh. - Okay. Well, I was talking about water, soda, you know? - Well, I wasn't, it's good to know you don't drink, neither does daddy. At least you guys are compatible in that regard. - Okay, so Eve. Where are you from? - I'm from Indiana. - Oh, why'd you move here? - It was work. - Speaking of which, do you have a job, what do you do? - I'm a veterinarian. - Oh, that's so sweet, I love animals. - That's interesting, interesting because we weren't allowed to have pets when we were younger, daddy's allergic to hair. - Okay, he's only allergic to cat hair and we weren't allowed to have animals because we weren't responsible. - Well, I work with horses, I breed horses. - Oh, that's different. - I was raised on a ranch and my uncle bred horses, it's not that different for me, I work for some high-end breeders. - Oh, see you can never judge a book by its over. - No, look at that. - Listen, I got your dad on a horse the other week. - You did not get daddy on a horse? - Yes, I did. - [Hope] Really? - Yes. - I got pictures that I can show you. - Wow. - Ooh, I'm impressed. - See. - [Dad] Hey, what's going on? - Oh my gosh, you did. - Dad! - Look at you. - You learned how to ride horses. - And you put on spurs and everything. - I have not learned how to ride a horse. - But he's learning. - You ready to go? - I'm ready. Nice to meet you, girls, and if you ever wanna come by the stables, why don't you come? - Bye, Eve. - [Eve] Bye-bye. - Bye, daddy. [mumbling] - Thank you. - See you at the stables. - Oh, stop it. I like her. - I don't know, she seemed a little ditzy, don't you think? - Come on, you should be happy for dad. - I am, I just... - You just what? - I don't know, I guess I just thought she'd be more like mom, that's all. - What? What, that's crazy. Dad's not trying to replace mom. He's starting over. He's mourn mom long enough. - Yeah. All right. I guess you're right, maybe I do like her, okay. - Well, dad must really like her if he's getting on horses. I mean, he's never been the outdoorsy type. - See, see that, she is trying to change him, okay? I definitely don't like her, final answer. - Well, don't tell dad that you don't like her. Okay, let him be happy, just stay out of it, and while you're at it, stay out of my business, too. - Just wait a minute, you're not gonna get off that easily, okay, where were you this afternoon? - I was getting my prescription filled. - It's getting worse, isn't it? Faith, you have to tell him. - I'm going to bed. - Really? Faith, come on, you're gonna ruin everything, okay, you know what, fine. Well, I'm gonna go to the bowling alley if you wanna stop by. - [Faith] Go home. [doorbell ringing] - Hold on. Hey. - Hey. Hope I'm not interrupting. - Nah, nah, nah. - Do you have a second? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, have a seat. - I wanted to talk to you about Faith. - Don't tell me you coming over here to break up for her. - What, why do you think she's breaking up with you? - I don't know. I mean, I haven't heard from her in three days. She hasn't returned any of my calls or my text messages. - Yeah, I know, she and I got into it, too. I haven't heard from her since I saw her on Sunday. - So, what's up? - Faith has sickle cell. - Huh? - She was diagnosed when she was four and it got really bad once, but it's manageable. It's just sometimes she gets these really bad pains and that makes her really sick. [slow melody] - Why didn't she tell me about this? - She thought you'd leave her and-- - And what, and what, come on, tell me what's the story. - Our mom died of sickle cell and Faith seems to think that that's her fate, too. - But she can live a full healthy life. - Yes, of course. Absolutely. I just want you to know that that's why she's been acting so weird lately. - All right, man, you ready to go? - I'm not in the mood to ball right now, man. - What? I told the fellas you was gonna be balling with us today, you've been on the road for all this time. - Look, man, I don't feel like playing right now, I got more important things to deal with. - Listen, why don't you go on and go and play? Just come by the house later, okay? - That's right, listen to Destiny Child. - Excuse me, Hope, my name is Hope, you suffer from ignorance. - Hope, cherish, love, forever, poverty, same thing. - Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life, end proverb, boom. - Yusuf means God increases. - And? - First of all, enough is enough, y'all, now stop. Now, you're my best friend and you're my sister, about to be my sister, we about to be a family, man. - Does that mean we have to get along? - Nope. - Yes. - All right, look, fine. You know what, I'll just see you later tonight, why don't you come by the house around eight, okay? - You need to stop, man. - That's gonna be your sister. - Look, why don't you be the bigger person and just squash it? - I can squash it and soon as she show me some respect. Forget all that, we gonna play some ball or what, man? - I don't really feel like playing now, man. - Dog. Why not, what's the problem? - Faith has sickle cell. - Dang, I'm sorry to hear that, man. - She's sick, man, that's why she been acting the way she been, all weird and stuff, man, 'cause she been sick. - She doesn't look sick. I mean, I don't see any difference. - You and me both. - She never told you this before? - Nah. - Oak tree, dog. I mean, think about it. If she lying about this, what else could she not lie about? - Man, you're damaged. Bad. - All right, man, you might as well quit while you're ahead 'cause taking care of somebody that's sick could drain the life out of you. - Man, how do you know? You ain't never take care of nobody but yourself. - My stepdad had leukemia and my mom spent the last six years of her life taking care of him. - Man, leukemia is different. - I don't know enough about sickle cell to make that call, now if you don't wanna take care of a sick woman, this is your best chance to walk away. - Man, I can't walk away. I'm about to get married to her. - But you not married yet. If she's pushing you away, it's a good sign. Taking care of a sick wife could drain the life out of you. - You know what, I'm done talking about this, man, let's go. Let's go play. - Good. Let's go blow some steam. - [Hope] Hey. How you feeling? - I'm okay. - [Hope] Yeah? - Yeah. I mean, the pain is bearable. - What the doctor say? - Same old thing. Stay on my hydra, more folic acid, drink plenty of fluids, blah, blah, blah. - Okay, that's good, right? - You don't have to stay here and check on me. I'm sure dad'll be home later. - Where's he, on another date? Wow. He really likes that girl, huh? - Yeah, I hope they fall in love and get married. - Speaking of which. I spoke to Norman today. - I know that you didn't tell him about me. - I had to. - [Faith] Hope, you had no right. - Sorry, you weren't gonna do it, I had to do it. - So, what? That's my choice. Stop trying to run my life, Hope. - I'm not trying to run your life, okay, but you're my baby sister and I love you. - I could be happy if you just butt out. - He loves you. - Maybe I don't love him. - Yes, you do, you're just scared. - You were there each and every time mom got sick, we had to wait on her, dad had to stop preaching. - You're not as sick as mom. - Yeah, but I might get that way and it's not fair for Norman to have to deal with this. - Well, you know what, now that he knows, it's all out in the open. Okay, so you both can deal with it and I really don't understand why you're being so ungrateful right now. - I didn't ask for your help, Hope, okay? You just get your own messed up life together. - Excuse me? My life is not messed up. - Yes, it is, you're lonely and you're angry and you're obsessed with being in people's business. - My life is fine. - Girls, girls. What's going on, it sounds like 1990 in here? What are you still doing here, Hope? - Faith is sick and doesn't wanna admit it. - I can get better if she's not here. - All right, you know what? Fine, I'll leave, but you're gonna be glad I did what I did. - Call you tomorrow, all right? What's going on, baby girl? - I'm having another crisis. - Still taking the-- - Yeah, I'm taking everything that I'm supposed to be taking. You know how this goes. - Why are you and your sister arguing so much? - 'Cause she found out that I haven't told Norman about my disease. - You haven't told him? - No, sir. - [Dad] Why not? - The last time I was in a relationship and I told him I was sick, he left. - He wasn't the person for you. - I know, but... When I met Norman, I just wanted to enjoy him, I didn't wanna have to think about him leaving and then things got serious so quick, I didn't wanna lose him. - But you have to tell him. - [Faith] Yeah, well, he knows now 'cause Hope told him. - Yeah, well, you know your sister, she means well. - She's a pain in the butt, I'm so sick of her. - You don't mean that. - Yes, I do. - Come on, you know she's tried to play mom ever since... - I know, dad. She's so annoying, though. She's the reason why I chose a destination wedding, so she wouldn't be planning the whole thing. It's not funny. I'm so sick of her, I can't take it. - Hey, you can take a lot more than you think, girl. Trust me on that one. All right? - This still doesn't change the fact that Hope gets on my last nerve. - Yeah, I don't know what you can do about Hope, but you definitely got to talk to Mr. Norman. [phone buzzing] - It's Norman, he's been calling all day. - You gotta go on and face that music. [doorbell ringing] Ah, sooner than you think. - Maybe it's Hope again. - What, when have you know your sister to ring the doorbell. - oh, how was your date - My date? Strike. Strike. - Oh, I was coming down. - Your father's downstairs, can we talk in here? - Yeah. - You know your sister came by today-- - I know, she was just here. That was none of her business. - So, you weren't gonna tell me. - I wasn't trying to trick you or anything. I knew that I had to tell you, I thought we'd have some fun and you wouldn't have to know, but then I fell in love and-- - You didn't want me to leave. - Guess hope told you about Steven, too. - What about him? - Steven was my last boyfriend and we dated for about two years and everything was fine until I got sick, he said he couldn't deal with me being sick like that every year, so he left. - I mean, are you sick a lot? - Well, I used to be, but I haven't had an episode in over a year until now. - What happens when you have these episodes? - Well, basically, my body breaks down. Sometimes I can't walk or stand, it depends. - I mean, how long does it last? - See. You're doing it. - Doing what? - You're trying to see how much time you have to spend with me being sick? See, this is why we can't be together. - What? Look, I'm just trying to figure this out. Listen, this was supposed to have been a conversation we had an year ago. - No, your job requires you to travel, you can't be home taking care of me. - Okay, so we'll get a nurse if it comes to that. - No, no. Look, I don't wanna be in this relationship anymore. - [Norman] You don't mean that. - Yes, I do, it's stressful. - It doesn't have to be. Look, in life, there are no guarantees. Listen, I can walk out this door right now, get in an accident, and lose both of my legs, and you may have to take care of me, and then what? - We'd be one sad couple. - Listen, the point is we can't predict the future, that's why we have to take it one day at a time. Look. I don't know that much about sickle cell, but I do know your mom had it and she had kids and you seem to have come from a normal family. - No, it's crazy to think that I could have a healthy, happy life with you, it's just too much. I don't wanna be with you. - You don't mean that. - [Faith] Yes, I do. - Look, I'm not gonna beg you to be with me. - Good. I think you should go, go. - Come in. How can you even show your face over here? - [Tangie] We need to talk. - Just excuse yourself, just leave, please. - I'm not pregnant. Did you hear me? I'm not pregnant. - How am I supposed to know you're telling me the truth? - Because it's true. I just said that to get you to break up with me. - I'm confused. - Look. Just hear me out, okay? I know that you're never gonna marry me. We've been together since I was 20, I'm almost 30 now, and I've been wanting for so long to have a family with you. - You don't think I know that? - I know you know that. But you're not doing anything about it. - So, why did you lie? - Because I tried to leave you before and it didn't work. So, I had to do something that would make you walk away. - All these mind games are ridiculous. I told you we could have a baby if you wanted to. - Yeah, but I don't just want a baby. I want a promise, something that says that we'll be together forever. - But you know we're gonna be together forever, that just a piece of paper, it doesn't really matter. - It's more than just a piece of paper to me. My parents have been married for almost 30 years and I don't wanna have no baby out of wedlock. - Hold up now, my mom had three of us out of wedlock, be straight. - Well, no offense to your mom, but I wasn't raised like that. - So, you accomplished what you set out to do, I left, why are you here? - Because at the time, it sounded like a good thing to do, but I didn't want you thinking I was out there on the streets like that. - So, you ain't pregnant? - No. - Girl, you had me tripping, you know that, right? - I'm sure. I'm leaving town. - You what? - Yes, I am going back to school. - But why? - You know how I always wanted to be a fashion designer, I got accepted into Domus in Florence, I'm moving to Italy. - I'm confused. First, you lie to me about being pregnant, then you tell me the truth about you leaving the country. - Look, I'm just here out of respect for what we had. - Have. - Had. Goodbye, Yusuf. - Man, you was right, you was right, women are crazy, man. - [Yusuf] I'm in love. - What, no, no, no, what are you talking about, man? Look, you hate women. I hate, no, we hate women. Stay with me, bruh, I need you to stay with me, come on now, you my mentor. - We don't, we love 'em, we love everything about them, we love their weave, we love how they erase their eyebrows and draw it back in, we love everything about them. There's no Tyrone, he's in love, too, you should be in love. We love them so much that it scares us into acting crazy. We just love 'em and vice versa. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what, what are you talking about? Listen, where's the dude that said about the oak tree, the shade, how the women are the shade? Man, listen, I need that dude, give me some more stuff to say, like the summer, women, hot breath, they're serpents, they're devils, listen, talk to me, man, I need you. - I gotta go. - Where you going? - In love. - No, man, you're not in love, you in hate. - [Yusuf] I love, love-- - They stink, man, no, don't do this. - Love. I'm in love. Love. - Am I in the Twilight Zone? - Hey, hi. - Calvin, hi. - How are you? I was supposed to meet you for lunch and I didn't show up, did I? I am very sorry, Eve. - I waited on you and waited and I figured something was wrong after so long, you weren't answering your phone or anything. - Yeah, I haven't even turned on my phone today, I don't even know where it is. Have a seat, please. Stuff, the last couple of days has really kind of, crazy. My girl Faith went into the hospital again the other night. I was very worried. - Well, Calvin, why didn't you say something? Is there something I can do to help? - No, no, I'm good. I've got it, in fact, she's getting out in an hour, I'm gonna go pick her up and I was just trying to maybe-- - Well, I see you've got your oven mitt out, I can help you cook, are you cooking now? - Yeah, but I'm good, really. - So? - So. - You'll call me later? - Okay. - Calvin, I understand that your daughter is sick. Is everything else okay? - Yeah. It's all right. I just can't lose my daughter. - Oh god. Is she that sick? - No, but I'm always just thinking about how quickly Anita deteriorated. - Don't think those thoughts, Calvin. Faith is gonna be okay.

I'll call you. - It's a rough time right now. - I understand. I'll check on you. Take care, Calvin. - Hey, listen, thank you for coming over. I know it's an awkward situation to put you in, but I ain't know who else to talk to. - No, it's fine, tell me what you need. - Faith says she doesn't wanna be with me anymore. - Norman, she just doesn't wanna burden you. - I mean, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Since the other day we talked, I just been doing a lot of research on sickle cell, but it just seems to be all varied. - Well, you know every case is different. Faith's is very manageable. - So, how sick is she? - Does it matter? - Look, I gotta know what I'm signing up for. - What difference does it make? If you love my sister, it shouldn't matter how sick she is. - Look, I didn't say it did, but I got to know. - Listen, when she has a crisis, she can be sick for a little while, a week, and sometimes she's in the hospital, sometimes she's not. Faith has this thing where she thinks that if she's feeling better that she doesn't have to take her meds, but that's not the case, she has to stay on her meds. - She thinks that it'd be difficult for me to travel, but I offered to give her a nurse and she told me no. - She doesn't want a nurse. She doesn't want anyone to worry about her. - I don't know what else to do. But I'm not giving up, though. - Good, you shouldn't. [phone buzzing] - Ah, man. - Oh god, is that Faith? - Nah, it's Yusuf, he's blowing me up. - How do you deal with him, seriously? It's so annoying. - What's the story on you? - What? - And him? I'm saying like what's going on? - He gets on my nerves, he's annoying. That's what's going on. - Why? - Because he's just always pushing his Islamic views on people. You know he tried to get Faith to convert? Did you know that? - I remember Faith asking about Islam a lot. - No, Yusuf had her all down there at the mosque trying to convert her, trying to get into her head. We were really clear, Faith was very clear about her belief system until Yusuf. We're Christians, our father was a preacher, that's what Faith believed until Yusuf. So, why do you care? - Because I grew up in a house where everybody fought over stuff that was just stupid. Look, I love you both, I just want y'all to work it out. - I don't know, Norman, he's pushy, he's bossy, he's opinionated, it's too much. - You should know. Look, all I'm saying is that you cannot get mad every time you don't get your way. I mean, it is what it is. Faith gotta do her own thing. - I know that. I do, I've let up a little and I'm trying. - You need to try harder because you know she chose a destination wedding specifically so you wouldn't have nothing to do with it. - What? - [Norman] Yeah, she did. - Wow. Okay, well. Listen, I'm gonna try, okay? - [Norman] And try hard. - All right, fine. - Because we don't want no third wheel in our marriage. - You just convince her to marry you, that's what your focus needs to be right now. - Don't worry about me 'cause I got a plan. - Oh, really, you're a man with a plan, okay. - I'ma get her. - The doctor says you're supposed to take a lot of fluids. - If I drink anymore water, I'm gonna float away. - There you go. What is this that I hear about you wanting to cancel the wedding? - I can't get married like this. - Come on now, this is temporary. - It's not fair to Norman to put him through this. I saw what you went through with mom. - What did you see, you were just a child. - I saw you worry a lot. It's not fair. - Well, it's his decision to make. - He's making a decision based on what he doesn't know. Norman loves his job in pharmaceuticals. - He can still do his job. All right? Maybe you can just find someone who's just as sick as you are and you can just lie up in the house together. - Doesn't sound like a bad idea. - This thing called true love doesn't come around every few months, all right? - Speaking of, how's Eve? - Who? - Eve. - Eve. - Yeah. - Eve is a wonderful woman, a very wonderful woman. - A wonderful woman? That doesn't sound very romantic. - Well, it's very complicated. - Why? You're single, she's single. She is single? - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. - Okay then, so what it is? - Well, Eve, you see, Eve has made it very clear that Eve is not interested in a long-term dating relationship and-- - Okay, and? - And Calvin is not really sure if Calvin is ready. - What are you waiting on, dad? I mean, you're not getting any younger. You're handsome and all, but you must admit you've seen your best days. Ow. - Yeah, see, see that's what you get. My best days, you talk about me like I'm an old race horse that needs to be put out of his misery. - See, you like her, so you're using horse analogies, you're all caught up in her world, just admit. - I'm just not really sure if I wanna get married again. - Why not? - You look like your mother. - Dad. Mom wants you to be happy, okay? It's been a long time, dad. No one's expecting you to live the rest of your life in solitude. Well, Hope might be, but we're gonna find her a man, so she can leave us all alone. - I made a commitment and now I'm walking down that road again. Sometimes I think maybe... It would be better if I was just alone. - Who are you telling? I'm the one that's supposed to be getting married this year. Just like you told me not to be scared, you can't be scared. - I'm not scared. I'm just you know a little unsure, maybe I'm a little scared, but after all these years, it's still, you know, this pain. - It's because you're still holding onto mom. You gotta live in the moment, dad. - Look who's talking. - I'm doing the best I can considering everything. Hey, how did you get in? - Hope's downstairs. How you doing, Mr.-- - [Faith] Oh, great. - This is for you. - Well, since you're both here, I have something to say. Sit down, dad I know you both think I'm being unreasonable and yes, I should've said something earlier, but I was afraid and since we're being transparent, we have to talk. - What's going on? - The sickle cell might've affected one of my kidneys, I just found out. - What does that mean? - We don't know right now. It's okay, dad. I'm okay. I've already wrapped my mind around this which is why I can now share it with you. - Babe. I don't know what to say. - There is nothing to say. See, this is why we can't be together. - Look. Hold on. Mr. McDonald, could I have a moment with your daughter, please? - I'll be downstairs. - Before you start, I've already made up my mind. - I just don't get it. The Faith that I know and fell in love with was always positive. I just feel like you just wanna give up. - Just because I don't wanna marry you doesn't mean I'm giving up. - But. - But nothing. Look, I don't mean to be so forthright, but I've been in denial for a while and it wasn't until we started talking about a family that I came back to reality. - Look, you know I've been doing my research on sickle cell and I understand the seriousness, but I also know that you can be fine. Look, I'm willing to deal with the occasional pain crisis. - That's not what you signed up for. - So, what are you saying? If I suddenly get sick, you're gonna get up and leave me? - No, I wouldn't, but I-- - You will leave me. - No, Norman, I wouldn't. - Then why do you expect me to do the same? - Please, Norman. Look. You're just saying all this because you really believe I'm gonna get better. I want you to be honest with yourself. If you marry me, you have to be prepared to sacrifice a lot. You have everything going for yourself right now and I want you to get everything that God has for you and you can't get that tied down to me. Look. I'm really tired. Can you call and check on me later? - If that's what you want. Okay, I'll come back. - Bye, Norman. - No. - Sure. - Well, no. - It would be good for you. - Hey, hey, hey, how is she? - Resting. - Did you talk to her? - Yeah. Not really, she's still saying the same thing. - Yeah, well, the thing about Faith is that she's very determined. - Stubborn you mean. - I don't mean to downplay her illness, but she's gonna be okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. - You know, she will, dad, and I know that. Norman, I'm starting to believe that your love is doing her a lot of good. - Yeah. I believe that, too. I need a big favor, Hope. - Sure, yeah, what is it? - I'm supposed to be doing this going away dinner for Tangie. Yusuf wants to surprise her. I need a little help. - So, the favor is actually for Yusuf. - Yeah, but you'll really be doing me the favor. - Ah, I think I should stay here. - I think you should go because it would be good to get your mind off of things. - Plus. This would be a good time for you and Yusuf to talk. - Oh, Norman, please don't start. I don't wanna talk to Yusuf, I really don't. Where's Tangie going anyway? - Italy, design school. - Oh, wow, prego, look at her. - You'll help? - Fine, fine. I'll get my purse. - Thanks. - A lot to take in, huh, Norman? - It is, it is. - So, listen, if you and Faith don't work out, I just wanna let you know that nobody's gonna blame you. - I can't walk away. - Yeah, but you gotta take a big look before you leap. Caring for a loved one who's sick, sacrifice after sacrifice, after a while it takes a big toll. - So, what are you saying? - What I'm saying, Norman, is that Faith is my baby girl and I love her with all my heart. I would love for you to marry her. But if you take her hand, you be prepared to keep it in sickness and in health. Small phrase, big statement. You gotta be ready. - [Hope] So, what are we cooking? - I got some spaghetti. - Spaghetti? She's going to Italy, she's gonna get enough pasta there. Come on, Tangie's from New Orleans, let's make some Creole food. - I don't have that at the house. - All right, then we have to go to the store. - Can't we just stick to spaghetti? - Hey, you asked me, okay, be careful what you ask for. - You ain't lying about that. - What? - Nothing. - What store you wanna go to? - Whatever. [Hope laughing] Just somewhere they got food. Knowing what you know, would you do it again? - Of the love we shared, absolutely. Goodnight, dad. Smells good up in there right now. - Well, I told you I had everything under control. - Mhmm, I see. - She'll be here any minute now. - Talk to me, man. So, you and her gonna be doing this long distance thing? - She don't want to. - Please, trust me, long distance relationships never work out. - How would you know? - Because I've been in one. - Exactly, one. You act like you've been in every long distance relationship that ever existed. - You know what, Yusufa, you could at least instead of sitting there with an attitude, you could say, "Thank you, Hope, "for helping me surprise my girlfriend." - It's Yusuf and I didn't ask you for your help. - No, I did. Look, I'm getting tired of y'all, you're getting on my nerves, y'all need to work this out. - Nah, dog. I don't like how she disrespect my religion. - Ugh. - And with that whole save a sister like the Christians might put it. - Okay, you know what, no one is disrespecting you, I just don't agree with you, there's a difference. - And that's fine, I didn't ask you to agree with me. I just don't like how you act like Islam is a cult. Have you even read a Quran? - No, have you ever read the bible? - Yes, front to back and the Torah. One thing you didn't know about me is I study religion and I was gonna teach it along with philosophy. - Well, good for you, okay? It's just that I believe in that-- - I know what you believe in. I was raised Islam and what bothers me the most is that you Christians who are supposed to love everybody are the one that most judgemental. - You know what, it's my job as a Christian to spread the word of God and that's my belief, that's what I believe in. - And the best way to do that is to lead by example, nobody wants to follow an angry Christian. - Boom. I mean, brother is kinda right. - No, that's right, so take the chip off your shoulder, I love Allah with all my heart and I'm so mad I've allowed you to take away my peace, I'm done. [Hope clapping] - It's a great sermon. Sorry to break up this little tea party, I'm gonna go check on the casserole. - Can't follow an angry Christian? You was on point with that one. - [Hope] I hear you. - You guys on point. Someone knocking on my door at my house. - I'm moving back in here soon. - [Norman] Nah, man. Oh, hey, Tangie, what's up, baby, how you doing? All right. - [Tangie] Good to see you. - [Norman] You, too, he in there. - Hey, Yusuf. So, I'm here, what's going on? - I wanted to have a dinner party for you before you left. - Oh, are we going out to eat? - Home-cooked. - All right, look, on that note, I think I'm gonna go check in on Faith at the crib, just tell Hope that I'll be waiting in the car, all right. - All right. - All right, cool. See you later, Tangie. - Bye. - So, you gonna join me for dinner? - Yeah. But I'm still leaving. - I know, but you can go at night, I mean, I expect you to go, I'm not gonna stop you. - Okay. Can I go freshen up? - Okay. - Thanks. - Hey, where'd Norman go? - He's in the car, he's waiting on you. - All right. - I thought it was a dinner party. - It is, for two. I'm gonna go and I want you to know that I'm sorry. - It's all love, all right, thanks for everything. - You're welcome. Bye. And you have a good dinner. Be easy on her. - I will. - Okay. - All right. - Bye. - And read a Quran. - [Hope] I will. - Hey. - Hi. - Hello. - How are you, Calvin? - I'm good, Eve, but you're here a little early, I thought you were coming by later this evening. - Well, Hope told me to come by and be here around one. - Hope? - Yes, she called and told me to come early. - What's up with the box? - I brought everything she asked me to bring. - Hope. Hope. - Yes, sir. Hi, daddy. - [Calvin] Hey. - Hi, there. - Thank you so much. - You are welcome. - What's going on? - Just a little something that Eve is helping me with. Thank you so much, okay. You'll see, daddy. - Okay, listen, young lady, you wanna tell me what this is all about because... - Daddy, you will see later. - Doctor, would you please step into my office? - Happily, thank you - Have a seat and maybe you can, you can tell me what is going on. - I was sworn to secrecy. - Were you? - Yes. - It's really good to see you smiling. - Yeah, it's been a rough couple of weeks, right? I missed you. - You could've called. - Yeah, I know. You know I had to get my head on straight. - Calvin, I thought things were going well between us. - They were. I'd like to think that they still could. - Listen. I don't wanna play games, Calvin, I'm too old for that. - I'm not playing games. - Well, look, I know for sure that I wanna be with you, but if you don't want the same, I understand. - You know something, I think I'm a little too old to be making new friends. I think maybe we should go for it. What do you think? - It sounds great. - Yeah? - Yeah, let's do it. - Let's do it. - Wow, looks like everything's going well between you two. - Yeah, okay, we're gonna talk about that as soon as you tell me what's going on. [doorbell ringing] - Saved by the bell, dad, get that, I'm gonna bring this up to Faith. - [Calvin] Yes? - Hey. - [Hope] Hey. - You didn't have to get me that. - [Hope] I know. - I could've gotten it myself. - I was already going downstairs, so I just wanted to get that for you. - Thank you. So, what kind of service is at church tonight? - Oh, it's just a visiting pastor and I promised I would go, so I'm just glad you decided to go with me. - Yeah, well, I haven't been able to go to church in a while, so it'll be nice. - Little sis, you look beautiful in that dress. - Thank you. - [Hope] You really do. - You didn't have to get me anything. - Oh, I know, I know I didn't, but I owed you for being such a pain. - Well, you did owe me. - I did, I did, I did. - I appreciate the dress. - Well, you look great. - You know, I was really eyeing this purse. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Oh, wow. - It was blue. - [Hope] Was it blue, with that flower thing on it? - Yeah. - Yeah, that's interesting. Did it look anything like I don't know maybe this one? - You got me the purse? Oh my god, what has gotten into you? I hope it stays. Thank you so much. - You welcome so much, you're welcome. You know everything's gonna be okay, right? - Yeah. I feel much better. We'll see. - And you know no matter what happens that I'm here for you. - As you always been. - And I know that I've been a little overbearing and all of that, but I want you to know that I'm going to give you your space, it's gonna be different. - Really? - [Hope] Yes. - What's gotten into you? - Let's just say I've had a little truth wake up call. - I love you. I don't want you to ever think anything but that, okay? - I know you do, I know you do. I'm gonna do better, all right, but I'm your big sister, okay, and I'm supposed to look after you, that's my job, that's what I do. - Okay, and you do your job very well. - Thank you. And also, one more thing, I know that you chose a destination wedding and I know why. I do and I just want you to know, I will have you know that I would not have-- - Yeah, right. - Okay, maybe a little, butt in a little bit, but you know that's just what I do, you know how I feel about marriages. I just get more excited about weddings than I do love. - Oh, don't say that. - It's true. - Well, you gotta put yourself out there, stop being so closed off and join the singles ministry or something. - Well, there is a guy. - What? - Well, you don't really know him. I mean, I don't really know him either. The mailman. - Oh my gosh. What? - I know, I know, it's so-- - The mailman? - Yes, yes, I don't know what it is, he just-- - I did not expect you to say the mailman. - I didn't expect to have feelings for the mailman, but something in the way he said, "I hope to see you around," oh my gosh, he had me at hope, I was done. - Oh my god, let's go. - I know, I know, I'm embarrassed. - I'm gonna tell him. - Don't. - Oh my gosh. - Yes, I am. - Wait 'til you see his skin, you might get hooked, too. I know Norman may have to watch out. - All right, hurry up, everybody, hurry up. - Thank you so much. - Come on, she coming, she coming. How I look? - Good, good. - I'm nervous, I'm nervous. - Oh my god, I'm so gonna tell him. - Oh, would you... - What's going on? - I know this may sound a little redundant, but will you marry me? - Get up, Norman, what are you doing? - I'm asking for your hand once again. - Norman, get up, come on. I thought we talked about this. - We did and I don't agree with you. I'm not gonna walk away. I wanna marry you right here right now. - Right here right now? - [Norman] Yes. - [Faith] I don't like surprises. - And I don't like rejection especially when it's not real. - [Faith] I was serious. - Look, you said you wanted me to be able to do what God is calling me to do - Right. - Well, God is calling me to be your husband. God is calling me to look after you. God has called me to love you when you don't have the energy to love on yourself. Look, I can't fulfill God's mission without you. So, you gonna have to come aboard. I mean, that is if you want me to be obedient. - I don't know about this. - Look, I know you love me and this is my decision. - What about your job? - I meant to tell you about that. I manage the district now. I have an office in the city, so I wouldn't have to travel as much. - I didn't want you to have to give up-- - I know, I know, but I wanted to check out other opportunities and my boss offered me a promotion. - A promotion? It's that simple? - It's that simple when you're doing what God has called you to do. Look. I don't know what the future holds, but I know we can start our future today. And I'll cherish every day from here until. Just say you'll marry me. - Yes. [Hope clapping] - Okay. All right, all right, let's have a wedding, let's get married. - How are we gonna get married right now? - Well, that's where I come in. - You're gonna marry us? - I don't have a church, but I'm still ordained. - Good, daddy. - You were determined to orchestrate my wedding. - That is absolutely right and there is absolutely nothing that you can do about it. - Clearly. - Okay, let's do this, let's have a wedding, here we are.
