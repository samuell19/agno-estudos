(Dramatic music) (electronic beeping) (dramatic music) (engine clatters) (speaking foreign language) (explosion booms) (speaking foreign language) (electronic beeping) (gentle music) (fire crackling) (dramatic music) (electronic beeping) (air roaring) (dramatic music) (asteroid zooming) (electronic beeping) (dramatic music) (electronic beeping) - The trajectory of all three meteors trace back to Rickenbach 10-31. - That asteroid is the size of Texas. Any chance it will impact Earth too? - No, no it will miss us, thank God, but not by much. According to this Rickenbach 10-31 will breeze by our planet Saturday night almost as close as the moon. - Jesus, this close to a global threat and we find out about it one day in advance. - Well, with all the debris out in space it's amazing Earth isn't hit more often. - Are you sure the meteors that hit California, Switzerland and Africa are part of Rickenbach 10-31? - Oh no doubt, precursors. The smaller bits that travel with the motherload but they get drawn in by Earth's gravity. - It's a good thing Rickenbach is so big, otherwise it would be pulled by Earth's gravity. - Yeah, I know, size matters. The one thing I can't explain though is when I replay the surveillance I get this kinetic energy spike. - Well that can't be possible. Have you double checked it? - Yeah, I've run the data five times. - What the hell is it doing? - Wobbling. - An emission this size can't be kinetic energy. It's been hit by something. - Hit by something like what? - Run the projection backward. - Good idea. (Tense music) What would cause it to do that? - Being hit from behind by a rogue asteroid. - That would explain the forward boost in Rickenbach's velocity too. - Okay, run the projection forward present plus one day. - Coming up. (Dramatic music) - That's it. All right, add a half day. - [Man] Present plus one day, 12 hours. - Now add another hour. - One day, 13 hours. - This can't be happening. (Electronic beeping) - Tomorrow night, 10:53. - Are you confident about this data? - I told ya, I ran this five times. This is right. - Okay, I need copies of everything, and I need the projections on DVD. - Where are you going? - Project Safe Skies. - They won't even give you the time of day! We're considered an annoyance, remember? - Well, maybe the threat of Earth's destruction will outweigh their insecurities. - Well, don't count on it! - I won't. (Dramatic music) Dr. Covington! - Madison, what are you doing here? - We need to talk. - Look, if it's about Rickenbach 10-31, you rest assured, we're tracking it. There's no danger. - But did you see the wobble? There was an impact. There was a kinetic energy reading that spiked right off the scale. - Look, I don't have time right now. You're gonna have to make an appointment. - No, just give me five minutes. I just want to show you something. - I told you, I can't now! - Please, just five minutes-- - Look, I'm late for a meeting. Give the report to my secretary. I'll deal with it in the morning. - My data shows a catastrophic impact tomorrow night! - Oh, for God's sake, Madison! If that were true, we'd know about it! - Look, just look at the data. Have your people check it out. - My dear, why don't you go back to NEATS. Tell your eggheads to relax, huh? The sky isn't falling. Let's get outta here. (Tense music) Cancel my meeting. This is General Dutton. He's co-chairman of Project Safe Skies. - Thank you for agreeing to see me. - Let's cut to the chase, okay? I think that you are a publicity-seeking alarmist, and you have about two minutes to convince me otherwise. - Well, you've seen the file, and the data shows that the asteroid is going to hit Earth at 22:53 eastern time tomorrow night. - Out of all the scientists in the whole world that do what you do every day, how is it that you, and only you, believe that this Rickenbach uh. - 10-31. - Whatever, that it's targeting the Earth? - I don't. We don't think it's Rickenbach 10-31. It's the rogue asteroid hidden behind it. That's why no one else has detected it. - We admit that we're not perfect. Small objects like the ones that surprised us in California and Africa and Switzerland are fairly common. They're too small for us to predict in advance. - But we're in agreement. We believe these are fragments of Rickenbach. - Maybe they were, maybe they weren't. We get hit by small objects all the time. Most of them burn up in the atmosphere before they hit the ground, or they fall into the ocean. We never know about it. But large-scale asteroids like Rickenbach 10-31, they've been on our radar for years. - You know, doctor, we think that your discoveries at NEATS are a little like reruns of the Honeymooners. - Well, with all due respect, sir, we feel that we've stumbled upon an uncharted asteroid that's on a course that could destroy the planet. - Madison, I've already got my team looking into it. - As you know, NEATS technology is light years ahead of anything you have at Project Safe Skies. And we can see things that your people can't. - Oh, excuse me, what about ghosts? Do you channel ghosts too? - What if I'm right? I mean, isn't this what Project Safe Skies is all about? (Sighs) I mean, I think you should be preparing to fire your big gun. - Oh, the big gun eh? Yeah, the mythic big gun. Well, I ordered one for Christmas 10 years ago, and Dr. Santa Claus has yet to show up. - We appreciate you sharing these concerns with us, but until we get some corroborating data, I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your concerns quiet. - Yeah, it's just a little matter of national security. - So you want me to keep this to myself? - Yes. - Then may God forgive you. (Dark music) - Uh, Covey, you know, next it'll be flying saucers on the dark side of the moon. Miss America there is dangerous. I'm gonna have her followed. - I'll have her data thoroughly checked out. You never know. - Well, I know that the president shouldn't know about this. He's got too much on his plate in the Middle East. - Well, why not? Why not keep these fears alive and justify all the money you've been spending on Project Safe Skies? - Covey, I'd agree with you if it worked, but what we've got now is a very expensive laser that can't open a can of tuna. And I don't want people nosing in, looking around, until we have the kinks worked out on this. - So you're saying if Dr. Taylor's right, we don't have a chance. - Not a chance in hell. (Dramatic music) (electronic beeping) - God! - Mads, any luck with the bigwigs? - Damn bureaucratic mentality! Say nothing, do nothing and your job is safe. - Are they just gonna let this asteroid hit us? - Not if I can help it. I need you to find somebody. His name is Richard Donovan. He's in the Washington area. He's a former Air Force major. He used to work on Project Safe Skies. - Yeah, I think I remember him. Wasn't he involved in that, uh, laser defense weapon? - Yeah, right, the one everyone pretended didn't exist. - [Man] Nothing recent, Mads. - Keep looking. - Yeah, gimme a minute. No phone bill, no electrical bill, no cable TV. Are you sure this guy's still alive? - Yes. - Bingo. - Let me see. Discharged, okay, but it doesn't say whether he was kicked out or he quit. - Twice decorated. - Valor under fire, so he's a hero type. Good, that's good. All right, what does it say about Project Safe Skies? - Just that he was transferred to special duty under Project Safe Skies. The rest is classified. - Classified, yeah, right. Like none of us in the space community knew that Richard Donovan was developing that laser weapon. - Well, you know how the military is. Everything's got to be shrouded in secrecy. - Yeah, right, like Area 51. - You know about that? I'm sorry, now you'll have to be killed. - Shut up. Okay, would you find out whether or not his address is a state secret? - Apparently not. A 45-minute drive from here, tops. - Perfect. All right, I'm gonna need stuff. All right, I'm gonna need another one of. Thank you. (Exciting music) (dark music) (doorbell rings) Major Donovan. - You got the wrong guy, lady. - No, I consulted in the initial phase of Project Safe Skies at a conference four years ago. - (Sighs) Dr. Taylor, right? - Yes. Can I talk to you, please, Major? - It's not major anymore. The Air Force and I decided it was in the national interest for us to part company. - Oh, you're an outcast. We have something in common. I really need to speak to you. - Not unless you have some farming tips. - It's a matter of life and death. - Please. - [Madison] Thank you. (Dramatic music) (electronic beeping) - If your calculations are right, Rickenbach was hit by something pretty huge. - Rear-ended, which is why it can't be seen. - And since Covington and Dutton can't see something tangible, they don't believe it's there. - Exactly, and because I work at NEATS. It's like talking to a brick wall. - Project Safe Skies intimidated by the Near Earth Astroid Tracking Society, go figure. - Well, I can understand why they're envious. With all the budget cuts, Project Safe Skies has fallen behind. Their programs, their hardware, everything is obsolete compared to what we've developed over at NEATS. - Do you trust in your data 100 %? - 99.9 %, yes. - So you're not positive. - Well, the probability is overwhelming, and I just think it's too great to ignore. - So why have you come to me? - How far did you get in testing the laser? - (Laughs) What laser? - Come on, everybody knows you were working on a laser for Project Safe Skies. - This conversation is over. - Why? - I'm sworn to secrecy in all matters of national security. You should know better. - Then let's talk off the record. Is there laser technology strong enough to deflect an asteroid? - Dr. Taylor, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm dead serious. - But, if there's a laser that can save us, you must help us! Seriously. Just tell me who to contact and who to see, and nobody will know that I was here. - They already know you're here. (Dramatic music) Dr. Taylor, leave this one alone. There's nothing you can do about it. It's too late. And you're getting mixed up with something far bigger than you know. - What are you afraid of? - Please, take your things and go. - This is serious. (Phone ringing) - Hello. - Covey, Dutton, sorry to wake you. - Oh, I'm still up, General, going over Dr. Taylor's data. - We received an interesting development. - What's going on? - I was informed that Dr. Taylor met with Richard Donovan this evening. - Oh dammit. - Yeah, there's a little surprise over which we can lose a little sleep. - Any idea what was said? - Well, to say the least, we were caught off guard, but we're working on it. Picked up a conversation at the door, but uh. Donovan, of course, he sent her away. So if you hear anything different, let me know, okay? - Of course. - And, Covey, remember, it always looks better when the sun comes up. (Dramatic music) - Ugh. - Well, that's it. It's over. - What happened? - Well, it turns out Richard Donovan is not the hero type after all. He doesn't want to get involved. - Nice. - And I was followed all the way there and back as if I'm the threat! - Mads, calm down. You're starting to let your imagination go wild. - Really? The van parked out front is a figment of my imagination? Pull up the security cam. Pull it up. - [Man] What van? - Pan to the left. See, see, conspicuous, isn't it? - They're just trying to intimidate you. - Well, it's not working. - So, what, do you think it's General Dutton's goons? - [Madison] Who else? (Dramatic music) Who's that? - I don't know. - He's carrying something. (Suspenseful music) - [Man] Yeah, it looks like a pizza box. - Did you order pizza? - No! - Is anybody else still in the building? - Not that I know of. (Doorbell rings) He must have the wrong address. (Doorbell rings) - Well, he knew which office to buzz. - Yeah. (Doorbell rings) Yeah? - [Delivery Man] Pizza delivery. - For who? - [Delivery Man] Dr. Madison Taylor. - She didn't order any pizza-- - Hold on! I'm Dr. Taylor. I'm gonna buzz you in. (Door buzzes) - What the hell are you doing? - Something weird is going on, and I want to know what it is. (Suspenseful music) (elevator dings) - The delivery took longer than 45 minutes, so the pizza's free. - But I didn't order this. - I'm really behind schedule. - B-b-but wait! What about your tip? That was very strange. - Don't open that. There could be an explosive in there or something. - No. It's probably just some lame way to get a listening device into the building. Hello, are we speaking loud enough? (Suspenseful music) - [Richard Voiceover] They're listening. Meet me right away at Route 4, 15 miles. Turn right on County Road 15, two miles. Barn on left. Don't be followed. I believe you, D. - So maybe, maybe Donovan wasn't a coward after all. Will you come with me? - I think I should stay here. - No, but they know my car. - Then you take my car. - I can't do this alone. God, I hope this works. - It will, just get down. Get your head down. - What? Do you see them? Are they following us? Can you see them? - No, coast is clear. We're good. (Electronic beeping) - Were you followed? - No. - I thought I told you to come alone. - This is Hockstetter. Anything to do with computers, he's our guy. You can trust him. - Guess we could use someone like yourself if you're willing to take all the risks involved. - Yeah, you can count on me, sir. - I think you already met Mark. - Oh yeah, the pizza guy. - Lieutenant Mark Lewis at your service. - He was my right hand, in charge of tactical maneuvers, and he's the only one of us with clearance to get inside Fort Kirk. - Stationed there, active duty. - Fort Kirk, isn't that where the laser-- - Hold on a second. Please have a seat, Dr. Taylor. - You can call me Madison. - All right, Madison. I wanna get something straight, straight right from the start. From now on, each of us will be committing treason. Now, this is a crime punishable by death. If you have a problem with this, this is the time to back out. (Dramatic music) All right. Full disclosure in a nutshell, for Project Safe Skies, I was in charge of developing a laser, a weapon of mass destruction, for the purpose of deflecting incoming space debris. It was supposed to be top secret, but everyone, including yourself, in the space community knew about it. But there's something you guys did not know about. Just as the development of the weapon was being completed, I was ordered to adapt a portable version, small enough to be mounted on an aircraft or deployed from a satellite. Now, this weapon could easily take out a city without any residual radiation. It would be the ultimate tactical weapon. We will build the first one. Someone will build the next, and the arms race will start all over again. - Not to mention what might happen if terrorists got their hands on one. - Yeah, but I can't imagine Project Safe Skies developing a weapon aimed at people? - You're forgetting the obvious, Madison. Project Safe Skies was overseen by the Air Force. - General Dutton. - Billions of tax dollars sunk into my invention, all under the pretense of saving the world from space rocks. When, in fact, it was all about killing people. Now, these recent meteor impacts are good news for General Dutton. He exploits fear to get the funding he needs, funding that he would never be able to get if they knew his real motives. - With Project Safe Skies, Dutton can make it look like all that money was being used for the peaceful protection of the planet. - Covington was okay with this? - I don't think he knew at first, but he's in so deep, he can't get out. - But you did. - Damn right I did. You know all the stories about the Manhattan Project? - Oppenheimer, the first atomic bomb. Yes, of course. - You ever consider how he felt? I mean, the thrill of pursuing research ends in nuclear holocaust. - Yeah, but science can't be held accountable. - Madison, that's just a rationalization. It's kinda hard to sleep at night with that on your conscience. So I stalled. All critical tests all mysteriously ended in failure. I sabotaged the whole project with defective computer codes. They never figured out what went wrong. - Are you sure you can get it to fire? - I know I can. But there's a conundrum. Once we fire this laser, there's no way to put that genie back in a bottle. Mankind will have been changed forever! - If someone doesn't fire that laser, there won't be much of a mankind to worry about. - Listen, I don't think you guys understand the enormity of the flip side of all this. If your calculations are wrong, then I will have unleashed this weapon over nothing! (Somber music) Once Dutton knows about it, there's no way of going back! Are you prepared to deal with this kind of responsibility? - But we can't be concerned about our place in history. We have to take the chance. We have to stop the asteroid tonight, saving millions of lives. We have no other choice! - I know. That's why I've made my decision to go ahead with this. I just hope it's gonna be worth it in the end. Let's get to it. - All right, let's go. (Dramatic music) - Good morning, General Dutton. The president wants to know what this news brief is all about. - What news brief is that, sir? - That would be this news brief stating that the European Space Agency has spotted an anomaly with a near-Earth asteroid Rickenbach 10-31! - Oh, that. Well, um. - Sir, does it pose a threat? - Sir, our scientists are still evaluating the situation, and we expect a report on that later in the day. - Later in the day. Oh, well, that's fine then. In the meantime, the European Space Agency is making us look like idiots! Now, you will have a full report on the president's desk within the hour. Is that understood? - Oh, yes, Mr. Secretary, fully understood, sir. (Dramatic music) - That's Fort Kirk? - Uh huh. - I thought it'd be more impressive. - Exactly. Most folks around here think it's a power plant, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. The cool stuff's hidden underneath. - Well, can we get any closer? - We don't want to attract too much attention. Let's go. - How many people are there? - About 200 people work there Monday through Friday, but we're in luck. The weekends are only 22 at any given time. - Where's the laser? - It's embedded in that mountain behind the building like a missile silo. It's a manmade volcano. The crater open up hydraulically. - Sounds like something out of You Only Live Twice. - Yeah, like James Bond. - What kind of laser is it? - It's a fusion laser. Do you know much about it? - Yeah, a cascading fusion reaction within a magnetic containment chamber, it creates energy that can shoot a focused photonic particle beam. - He certainly didn't miss his physics classes, huh? Now, at full power, this laser can slice the moon in two. Deflecting an asteroid is easy. The hard part is hitting a moving target with a stationary laser. Because the Earth is moving as well as rotating in its orbit, we have a very short firing window. - And we won't have a clear shot of the rogue until it emerges from behind Rickenbach. - When's that exactly? - Just before 10 o'clock tonight, an hour before impact. - I hope your calculations are right. (Dramatic music) (electronic beeping) (phone ringing) - Covington here, you got anything? - Oh, yeah, well, I got something, an earful of it from the president's press secretary. Those European space cadets, they've announced an asteroid anomaly. Now, I had to crack a Funk & Wagnalls to find out what that meant. - Rickenbach 10-31? - Yeah, same one that got you and Dr. Chicken Little all flipped out. - But did the European agency say anything about a second asteroid hidden behind Rickenbach? - No, not a word, so relax. All we gotta do is release a statement from Project Safe Skies in about an hour. - Look, Dutton, I've been testing Dr. Taylor's rogue theory, and, I gotta tell you, I think there's an outside chance she might have something here. - Covington, enough. If the president gets spooked by this, he's gonna want to know why, after all the billions of dollars, we don't have a weapon to deal with this. - Yeah, yeah, and they're gonna cut the funding. I know. - Funding? It'll trigger a congressional knee-jerk investigation. And Donovan, oh, he'll have us by the you-know-what. And the press, they will twist us slowly, slowly, ever so slowly in the wind until we're dead. - If Taylor's right, we're all dead. - Well, Covey, it ain't over till it's over, so just keep your big mouth shut, and remember that loose lips sink careers. Okay? God bless and goodbye. - The route was clear, not a soul out there. - You got everything? - Yeah. - No guns. - Uh, the guards have guns. We need these weapons for self-defense. - [Hockstetter] He's right. There's no time to argue. - Hey, hey! Hold on. It's not a game. The guards will shoot to kill. - It's what they're trained to do. - We need to level the playing field if we want a fighting chance. - No, no. - Plan B. - Tranquilizer guns. (Gun firing) - These'll knock out a human target in seconds. - Not fast enough to stop return fire, which is why I recommend plan A. - But it's your choice. What's it gonna be? - The tranquilizer gun, plan B. - Hockstetter? - Tranquilizer gun, plan B. - Fine. - Mark and I will carry these too, real bullets. Just in case. - Fine, fine. - All right, then it's settled. - Okay, so when do we storm the base, captain? - That's what Donovan and I have to strategize. - You and Hockstetter should check up on Rickenbach and its tailgater. - Um hmm. (Dramatic music) (gentle music) - Any progress? - Ugh, unchanged. Everything's on course. - [Richard] Where's Madison? - Up there. Said she needed a break. - May I? - Yeah, sure, come up. - How ya doing? - I'm wrestling with my emotions. - Which side is winning? - I don't know. I can't figure you out. - What do you mean? - Well, you're intelligent and sensitive. And then you go all Rambo, and you drag a couple of neophytes like Hocky and me, and you pull us right into battle! - You're the one who came to me and begged for my help. Nobody said it was gonna be easy. - I know, I know. I just didn't think it was gonna turn into this huge, big-- - Military operation? Listen, Madison, I spent 12 years out of my adult life in the Air Force. This is what I know. I fought wars. It's what Mark knows. It's what everybody on that base knows. There are no other ways. - I know, I just thought maybe we could do a less invasive approach. - Like what, with words, proper channels? You already tried that. It didn't get you anywhere. - I know. (Sighs) But what about your pacifist ideals? I mean, isn't that why you quit the military? - I wrestle with that decision every single day. It may sound contradictory, but nothing is ever black or white. - Yeah, but, I know what's right and what's wrong. - We were raised to believe that enemies were evil forces outside of our nation. Yet, I came to realize that I was working for an enemy inside my own government! - General Dutton? - Yeah. He was raised on fear in the Cold War era, when enemies were obvious and power was decided by who had the biggest military forces. For General Dutton, this laser weapon represents the holy grail, the answer to everything he's been programmed to achieve. - But come on, he is a power-hungry, money-grubbing monster. - Yeah, that's one way of looking at it. But you can't accuse him of being selfish. He hasn't squirreled away a fortune for himself in some Swiss bank account. Every penny of Project Safe Skies has gone directly into the development of this weapon. He simply wants its use redirected to make sure that the United States will remain the most powerful nation in the world. - But he's broken the laws of the very nation he claims to serve. - He had to break some laws along the way, but it was all done in the name of patriotism. There's a lot of Americans in this country that believe in that philosophy. Trust me. - I respect the guy so much more now. Thank you for enlightening me. - Listen, Madison, all I'm trying to tell you is in this war that we're about to wage, the difference between the good guys and the bad guys is one big gray area. I mean, we're breaking the laws of this nation too, in case you're in denial. But just like Dutton, we're not doing this for ourselves. We believe that what we're doing is the right thing. - Where does that leave us? - There is no easy answers. To me, it's just about winning. - By any means necessary. - Yeah, you arm yourself and hope you can pull the trigger faster than the other guy. - Spoken like a true war veteran. - There's also the other side of me that just wants Dutton's head on a platter. - Ah, pure blood-thirsty vengeance. - A lot more satisfying, don't you think? - Now you're talking. - Seriously, though, if we're able to fire this weapon tonight, this is gonna force Dutton to start answering some very difficult questions. - He'll weasel out of it. He always does. - Maybe. Maybe not. - What? Is there something you're not telling me? - Well, when I made my decision to leave, I knew I needed a contingency plan, just in case Dutton figured out how to use the laser without me. So I copied some incriminating files, set up a computer program that requires me to log in every week or else those files go directly to Congress. - Wow, I'm impressed. - And if this raid tonight lands me in jail or dead, the data I stored in my computer will automatically go to Congress, and Dutton's days will be over. - Wow, you thought of everything. - I was trained by the same military that trained Dutton. Now, it's getting pretty late. We better get going. - Okay. (Madison sighs) (phone ringing) - What is it? - I'm on my way to the Pentagon. The press secretary's meeting us there. - Dammit. - [Dutton] Oh, guess what else? - I'm afraid to ask. - Donovan and Taylor are both missing. - Great. (Military music) - At 20:00 hours, there are two crew buses, 20 personnel on each. One goes in, one goes out. Now, for security, one bus can't leave until the other one arrives. - I make sure the relief bus doesn't arrive. - And I okay the crew on the base to go home. - With both crews in transit, there should only be two guards inside the compound. - Once I'm inside, the rest is a piece of cake. - Madison, you're coming with me. - Okay. - Hockstetter, you're with me. - You got credentials. How do I get in? - Just wear your lab coat. When we get there, let me do all the talking, okay? - It sounds too simple. - Yeah. - Less is more, fewer things to screw up. - All right, it's 19:45. Time to move out. (Dramatic music) - So what am I to tell the president? Are we in danger or aren't we? - Mr. Secretary, we've heard all the reports from Europe. However, all our experts say there's nothing to worry about. - And we certainly don't want to cause a panic. - No, of course not. The president agrees, but if the threat were to be real, what are the options? What's the status of that laser weapon at Fort Kirk? - That's a complicated question, sir. - General, is the weapon capable of protecting us from this potential threat, yes or no? - If necessary, we can make it work. - Well, you better hope you're right. (Dramatic music) - What the hell did you say the laser worked for? You lost your mind? - I don't want him looking into Safe Skies and the laser. If they do, we're done! - Dutton, my hands are clean. I never knew what the hell that was-- - Covey, Covey, hold on. I can't help you out on this. Your signature was on the budget, on the payments, and, if this whole thing goes down, you and I go down with it in a double-seater. (Dramatic music) (electronic beeping) - [Madison] It's coming. - [Richard] Sitting duck. - Be careful. (Gun firing) (tires squealing) - Bullseye. - Nice work. - Any sign of bus number two? - Not yet. - Look, you can't go till the other crew gets here. - Tell that to these guys! It's Saturday night, and they're ready for some serious R&R. - [People On The Bus] Yeah! - Look, I'm sorry. I can't let you go. We've got our orders. (Vehicle approaching) - Oh, finally, relief is on the way. (People on the bus cheering) - That's not the bus. - I don't think this is gonna work. - Just relax, we'll be all right. - Lieutenant Lewis, I didn't know you were on duty today. - Well, Sergeant Philip's computer crashed. He asked me to meet him here with my tech support guy. - ID. - Oh, yeah. Nice evening. - Civilians need clearance, sir. - Sergeant Philips arranged the approval. You didn't get it? - It hasn't arrived yet, sir. The relief bus is running late. - That's odd. Well, then I guess we'll just have to wait here. - You can't block the entrance, sir. - Well, what would you have us do then, Corporal? - I'll open the gate, sir, and you can wait over by the guard booth. - Thank you. We're in. - They think it's a normal blowout. - Yeah, all right, man. Okay, thanks. Hey, Stevens! Relief bus got a flat tire. - Oh, well, that explains it. - Well, people, get comfortable. We're gonna be here a while. (People on the bus groaning) - Just wait here and be cool. Corporal! What is the hold up? - Sir. Uh, the relief bus has a flat, sir. - Well, why are you holding this bus then? - Standard operating procedure, sir. One bus arrives before the other one leaves. - I don't see any immediate security threat, do you? - No, sir. - These men have worked hard all week. Don't you think they deserve their Saturday night? - Yes, sir. - Then let the bus go. I'll take full responsibility. - Sir. All right, you guys get outta here. Have fun. (People on the bus cheering) - Any coffee in there? - [Guard] Yeah, help yourself. - What's taking so long? - I don't know, but Hock and Mark better hurry up. They've almost got that tire changed. - I hear something. (Vehicle approaching) - (gasps) It's coming. - Let's get back to the car. Come on. (Suspenseful music) We'll just wait here a second till the bus clears. - Okay. - Perimeter patrol. - What? (Flashlight tapping) - Okay, you two lovebirds can come up for air. - Sorry, man, we'll be outta here shortly. - Donovan. - Oh hey, man, I didn't recognize you at first. - Evening, ma'am. - Good evening. - This place is off limits. You should know better. (Dramatic music) - Oh my God, are you okay? - That was awesome! - Is he okay? - He'll be fine. - I can't believe I just did that. Oh my God. - Listen, sorry about the kissing, I was-- - No, no, no, it was okay. It was okay. It was unexpected. It was nice. - It's not the time, you know. We have to save the world. - I know, but if anything should happen to us. - I, I feel the same way. Let's get outta here. - Hockstetter, you want some coffee don't ya? - I do? (Throat clears) I mean, yeah, I do. Thanks. - Stevens, why don't you head over to the commissary, rustle us up a fresh pot of coffee. I'll cover you here. - Yes, sir. - Oh, and bring back some extra cups and milk and sugar too. And you better let me borrow this while you're gone. - Nah, that's cool. - What, you got four hands? How are you gonna carry everything? Relax. (Vehicle approaching) - Here comes the bus. - That's too small. I'll take care of it. - No, no, no, you better let me do it. ID and security clearance. (Tranquilizer gun firing) Ugh! - I found his keycard. Here. - Hockstetter, you're coming with us. - How you doing? - So far so good. - Wasn't that Major Donovan? - Yeah, yeah, he hasn't been here in a while. - Hey, he got kicked out. - Oh, you didn't hear about the lawsuit? - No. - Yeah, the judge ruled they had to let him back in. - Oh, really? - Yeah, really. - Hey, where did Carmichael go? (Tranquilizer gun fires) Uh! - Madison, get the laptops. - [Madison] Okay. - Hockstetter, Mark's gonna need your help. Just wait for him, okay? Give him a hand. - No problem, all right. (Dramatic music) - Hurry, this way. - How far? - We're almost there, come on. - What's that for? - It's for Mark. Come on, this way. Come on. - Flex your muscles, Hockstetter. The hostage goes with us. - This is it, the laser control room. - I can't believe we've made it this far. - Oh, no. - What? Has the code been changed? - I don't know. - Try it again, try it again, try it again. Come on, come on, come on! - Nothing. (Dramatic music) - Over there by the railing. - Okay. - Mark. - What's up? - The keycard's not working. - Dammit! All right, I'll send Hockstetter with mine. - What happened? - Their keycard won't open the door to the control room. Go. I'll take care of this. Hockstetter's on his way. - Okay. He's sending over Hockstetter. - Okay, try it again, try it again. - Here, try this one. - [Richard] Nothing, it's not working. - Here, let me see. - I hope you're right. - Come on, please, please, please, please. (Gasps) Yes! (Dramatic music) - Wait, this will engage the laser coil to start heating up. (Machines whirring) This is my base. I'll be controlling the laser from here. You guys come down here. You can link up your computers from here. And, Hockstetter, see if you can track the asteroid from here too. - Okay, your firing window's approximately 55 minutes away. - That's cutting it close. - Too close? - It takes time to charge the laser. (Vehicle approaching) (horn beeping) - Hello! Hello! Anybody home? - Donovan, the relief bus is outside the gate. - Is there a problem? - Not yet. - We need an hour. - I'll make sure you have it. - The bus? - Uh huh. Don't worry, they can't get in. - Okay, guys, come on! Hello? Where are you guys? Hello. - Well? - Still no change. (Phone ringing) - Yes. An alert? Okay, keep me informed. - The rogue? - There's been some kind of a security breach at Fort Kirk. - Donovan? - Yeah, it's gotta be, and he's teamed up with that lunatic Taylor. - But why? The laser's useless. - Oh, no, Donovan that sly fox. He's known all along how to fire that damn thing up! Bring my limousine out front now! (Dramatic music) - I may not be charged up to full power by 10 o'clock. - It's gotta be Donovan. Do something to speed it up. - I need at least 55 % power to fire, and it needs to hit this exact spot for 15 seconds. That should move the asteroid's orbit about three degrees. - What the hell's going on? Who's in charge here? - I am, sir. General, sir, the gate's locked down. No one visible inside. - How many men have you got? - 20. - Donny, trouble. - What's up? - Dutton's at the gate. - Of course he is. - Gentlemen, ten hut! At ease. I am General Dutton. There is no imminent danger and no terrorist threat, but I want that gate open within five minutes by whatever means necessary! Understood? - [Soldiers] Yes, sir! - Go to work! (Dramatic music) - Hey, hey, you guys, stay back unless you want to get fried! - He's got the men from the bus trying to pry open the gate. - Just fire some shots in that direction. Just to scare 'em. No direct hits. - We'll do. - Hey, incoming, hit the deck! (Gun firing) (soldiers yelling) - No imminent danger, huh? - Covey, shut up. - That slowed 'em up. - Yeah, good. Keep them distracted. - Ugh! - 35 % power. - I'll have full line of sight in five, four, three, two, one. Measures, measures 475 miles across. - My God. - You were right, Maddy. - I wish I was wrong. - There's only a 29 second firing window. We need to hit in 17 minutes, before the Earth's rotation takes the sweet spot out of range. - Christ, do I have to do everything myself? - Where the hell are you going? - I'm gonna drive this bus through the damn gate! (Engine sputtering) Come on, baby! - 45 % but not climbing fast enough. Come on. Mark? - Dutton's on the bus. I think he's gonna crash it into the gate. (Dramatic music) (men struggling) - Mark? Talk to me. - [Mark] Ugh! - Mark? - (Gasps) What? (Tranquilizer gun fires) - Hockstetter! Hockstetter, come on! - What's going on? Go, go, go, go, go, go! - Hockstetter, come on, hurry! - Is he dead? - No, he's just tranquilized. (Engine sputtering) - Kick! Run! Uh! Where you been, Corporal? - Held hostage, sir. I just escaped. The sniper's been tranquilized and disarmed. - Well, Carmichael, don't just stand there. Open the gate. - Yes, sir! - All right, men, follow me! - Oh, Jesus, Stevens, you too? - [Soldier] Let's go, come on! - [Carmichael] It's okay, I got you. - Come on, give me a hand. Let's get him outta here. - [Madison] Hey, what happened? - [Richard] He got tranquilized. - [Madison] Is he gonna be okay? - Yeah, yeah. Now, get back to work. Let's go. We need to compensate for the angle in the Earth's rotation. - I already calculated that, chief. - You only get one, maybe two shots. - We're ready, we're ready, just get the power up. - Okay. - Laser locked on the target area. (Electronic beeping) - Opening silo. (Siren wailing) - 10. - [Soldier] Let's go. - Weapon up. - Nine. - Let's go, guys! - Get in line! - Eight. - Move, move. - Seven. (Electronic beeping) - Six. Five. - Turn the power off now! - Four. - Now, God dammit! - Three, two, one. Donovan, what happened, where's the power? - I don't know. - What happened? What's going on? - They shut all the power down. I can't do anything. - No! Come on, you've got to get it! - I can hear them. They're outside the door. - I don't care, I don't care. Come on, fire it up! - Keycard. - It won't work with the power out. Then turn the power back on. - Is the laser gonna work? Is it-- - Listen to me! There's no power! We have nothing! We're done! They're comin' in right now. I can't get to any of it! - Hocky. - [Hockstetter] I got nothing. - We're done. - Use the key, Covey. Open the door. - All right, all right! - There's not a moment to lose. (Key beeping) (dramatic music) - [Soldier] All right, let's go! Move it, move it! Go, go, go, go! Nobody move! Hold your position! - You are all under arrest! - The asteroid is real! - My God. (Phone ringing) Covington here. Yes, Mr. President. I'm afraid it's true, sir. We are tracking the same asteroid. The president wants to know if the asteroid can be stopped. - No! We've missed the firing window! - Mr. President. No, but... Mr. President. (Asteroid roaring) - That firing window was to move the asteroid, right? - Yes, but we've missed it. - So what if we want to destroy the asteroid? Donovan said it could split the moon in two. I mean, can't we still fire and target at a different location? - Yeah, that's it. - What? - We could blow it up. We could destroy it. - What about the billion smaller rocks that come down on us? - Not if the laser blast is powerful enough! Most of the debris would just burn up in the atmosphere. - I'm gonna power everything back up. Let's go. - Hocky. - Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it. - How much power can you get us in two minutes, Donovan? - Not enough. - We don't have a choice! We have to fire in one minute, 56 seconds! - It can't be done. - It must be done! (Dramatic music) - It's heating up faster. It didn't cool down much when the power went off! - We have a one minute firing window starting now. (Electronic beeping) - Not enough power. - We're locked on target. Now! - Not enough power! - Donovan, fire! (Laser firing) - No change, the asteroid's still coming! - Donovan, it's still coming! - Well, hold on. - [Dutton] Donovan. - It's gonna work! Trust me, it's gonna work! - Firing window closes in 10 seconds! Nine, eight, seven, six. Four. - We're almost at maximum power. - Two, one. - Ah! - Yeah, we did it! - Wow, we did it! - Hey, we did it! Hey. - Looks like we made it. - We made it, man. - We did it! Donovan, thank you! Oh my God. - How did you come up with that, huh? - I'm brilliant, man. - I guess so. You good? All right, good. (Gentle music) - Moments ago, the Air Force fired an experimental laser at an approaching asteroid, blasting it out of harm's way. Most of the remaining debris is expected to burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere, and no casualties are expected. For reasons of national security, much of what has just transpired will remain classified, but the president expresses his sincere gratitude to a few very courageous scientists who took tremendous initiative and saved our planet from certain disaster. Thank you. (Reporters shouting) (electronic beeping) (slow jazz music) (doorbell rings) - Hi. - Hi. Please don't tell me the sky's falling again. - Well, not that I'm aware of yet. I thought I would bring you a token of my appreciation to say thank you for believing in me. - Nice, thank you. - And I thought that if we kissed again that it would be nice to do it without being in a panic and having to save the world. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I like a woman of action. - Oh yeah? - Why don't we go inside so we can pop this cork. Come on. - [Madison] That is so naughty! (Dramatic music)
