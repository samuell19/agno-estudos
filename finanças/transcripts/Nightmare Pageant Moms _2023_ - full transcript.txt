Hm. Hi, Mom. I just finished at the gym. I did a spin class and a full circuit. I'm exhausted and I need to eat. Yes. Mom, I'm taking this pageant seriously. Literally, I am so dizzy and all I've had to eat today is a stick of celery. What-whatever. Mom. Mom, I gotta go. Harper, what a surprise. I haven't seen you at the gym in months. Adeline, I'm here every day. Guess we must be on different schedules then. You know, Lilliana, she's been working out twice a day for months to prepare for the pageant. Oh. Well, I gotta get going. Where are you rushing off to? Just dinner with some friends. Oh, it's kind of late for a meal, don't you think? Most of the girls just chew on an almond when they get hungry. At least, the winners do. Have you been jogging? No. Why? Oh, you're just so sweaty and out of breath. Guess it was a little strenuous getting outta your car. You remind me so much of your mother. Really? How so? Well, when I competed against her, many years ago, she lacked the discipline needed for pageants. That's funny, because if I remember correctly, she beat you, several times in fact. Sometimes people find other ways of winning, especially when there's a male judge open to being swayed. Are you insinuating that my mother slept her way to a crown? There's no insinuation, honey, she did, and that's why you remind me so much of her. You know, Adeline, you walk around like you own the pageant world, but the truth is, is you're a joke. You've never even won a title, but your mother has. And the only reason that you continue to stay relevant is because she funds the whole thing. How sad, Mommy pays so you can play. How dare you talk to me like that? Oh my God, did you just put your hands on me? Oh, I'm gonna sue you for everything that you've got. Oh, wait. Oh, you don't have anything, because Mommy owns it all. Shut the hell up, Harper. Oh, yeah? Or what? God, you're pathetic, Adeline. Your daughter knows it, your mother knows it, even your husband knew it. That's why he finally dumped your sorry- Oh no. No. No, it's not okay. Why wasn't this problem flagged before? We were supposed to have our grand opening next week? Sure. Thanks. Mom, what's going on? The building inspector came out to give the okay so that I could open the spa, but we didn't get the approval. What? Why? Apparently, there was some structural damage that was missed in the original inspection. Now they're saying we can't open until all the repairs are complete, which could take at least six weeks. That's awful, Mom. Is there anything I can do? I wish there was, sweetie. I'm just happy to see you. Which I thought you had to be at school until 6:00. I, I finished my project early and I got some good news, so I decided to rush home. Well, what is it? You know that literature residency program I talked to you about? Yes. They picked me to go. Ah! Yes! That means I would get to spend my first semester in college in London. Ah, sweetie, that's amazing. But, but I, I, I can't accept it, Mom. Well, why not? Because the program itself, it, it costs money. And housing isn't cheap. Without the spa being able to open up, you know, I didn't... Maybe we can get a loan. But I thought with all the medical bills from dad and the second mortgage, we wouldn't be eligible. I'll tell you what, you don't worry about that. Let me figure it out. I gotta make some calls about the damage, anyway. I'll call the bank and see about a loan. But you're going to London, no matter what I have to do to get you there. Okay. Okay. A mother-daughter pageant. Oh, no. No, I know it sounds crazy, but look at the cash prize. $100,000. That's enough to cover my residency, and there'll be plenty left over to put into the spa and pay off the bills from dad. There's no fee to enter the pageant. Yeah, but don't people train for years to win these things? I don't know. I, I looked it up online, and there are three segments. There's the evening gown portion, the interview section, and the talent competition. Talent? What, like singing or dancing? Sweetie, I have two left feet, and you've heard me do karaoke. No, it says you can do anything; paint, read your own poetry, perfect for me, uh, juggling, cake decorating, martial arts, play an instrument. You play the violin and are really good. Sweetie, that was a long time ago. But, the worst thing that can happen is we lose. Yeah, I don't know, honey. The first step is to apply online, and I think we should give it a try. Please. Don't ever say I don't love you. "Why do you wanna enter the pageant?" Hmm. I've never done a pageant before, but it's a great way to... Stretch outside your comfort zone and encourage other people to be brave, and do the same. You're looking so much better, honey. I knew getting you that chemical peel and those fractional lasers on your face would do the trick. Thank you, Mom, for reminding me that my skin is a mess. Honey, I just want you to look as beautiful on the outside as you are on the inside, especially with our big night coming up. It's our first mother-daughter pageant. Oh, isn't this so exciting? Yeah, I mean, it's gonna be really fun. Fun? Honey, this is a competition. You are well aware of how serious it is. Mm, I know, I know. I've done this before. Did your father make plans with you for his birthday yet? Um, he's still working on his work schedule, but he is going to. Or he's waiting to see what his flavor of the week wants to do. Mom, stop. If your own father doesn't wanna make plans with his daughter, that's his loss. He does. He texted- Come on, let's go for a jog. I'll race you. We both have to get in shape if we wanna win this pageant. It's the pageant. Oh my God, answer it. Hello? Emilia, hi, this is Faye from Atlanta Regional Pageants. I'm calling to let you know that after hundreds of applications, you are one of 10 mother-daughter teams to make it to the next round shoot. We are? I mean, um, thank you so much, Faye. We're so excited. You're welcome. Now, we have a meet and greet next week. I'll send you all the details by email. That sounds great. Thank you, again, Faye. You're so welcome. We'll see you next week. Bye. Ooh, yes! Oh my God, we did it, we did it! Yes! Oh my God, I told you. Oh, you did? - Oh, yes. - Wow! Are you ready for this? Are you ready? What have you gotten me into? Yes! Aah! Everyone looks so elegant. I mean, the email didn't mention a dress code. Okay, come on. Look at Patrice, she looks so basic. Hm. And so red. Mm. Rumor is she and Vivienne, early favorites. Really? Hm. Hm. Do you know what? One second. - Hi. - Oh God, here she comes. Help. Adeline. Darcy. Oh. Mwah. A mother-daughter pageant, so exciting, right? It really is. Well, this must be like a normal day for you. I hear you've been competing quite a bit lately on the Mrs. pageant circuit. Very cute. I dabble here and there. Won a crown or two. But over the last year, I focused mainly on my charity work. I saw. You were named Woman of the Year for the Atlanta Heart Foundation. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm really proud of the work I've done with them. Mm-hmm. Um, well, good luck today, ladies. You too. She's not gonna be their favorite for long. What was that? Who are those two? I don't know. Go find out. Go. Hi, you must be new. I'm Darcy. Oh, I'm Emilia, and this is Sophie. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. I haven't seen you around. Pageants are such a small world. Actually, it's our first time entering. You mean, ever? - Mm-hmm. - Yes. Oh my. And you were chosen as one of the 10. That's... Well, what talent do you plan on performing? Oh, I write poetry, so I think I'll do a reading. Oh, how sweet. And my mom is really good at the violin. Oh, she's talking me up. The truth is, I haven't played in quite some time. Hm. Crystal, my new pageant coach, has led several of her clients to nationals. I'm telling you, working with her has been game-changing. Never heard of her. Adeline, it's so good to see you. You as well. How are things? Great. I just celebrated my 25th wedding anniversary. Still feels like we're in the honeymoon stage though. Congratulations. Thank you. Is your mom here? Oh no, she's at another important engagement today. Mm. She must be thrilled you made the cut this time? Of course, but she'll be even happier when Lilliana and I win. Good luck with that. I'm gonna go powder my nose. Mm-hm. - I think I'll win. - Hi, ladies. - Hi. - Hey, Mom. - Having fun? - Yeah, great time, mm-hmm. Ugh, oh my God, doing a pageant with our mothers is so weird. - It's so weird. - Who decided to make it a mother-daughter pageant anyway? They've never done this before. Ugh, I have no idea. Well, as long as your mom keeps winning the old people pageants, we'll be okay. Well, what about you, Lilliana? Your mom is, like, really intense about this stuff. Yeah, that's an understatement. The tag on this dress is so itchy. - Do you have scissors? - No. What did you find out about the newbies? Oh. The mother's name is Emilia. She's opening a spa. Now, Sophie is the daughter. She's into literature and poetry. Emilia said she used to play the violin, but now she's rusty. That's it? Well, I tried to find out about a husband, but she didn't say much. Get the feeling that there is not one in the picture. Oh, great. That means she'll use a single mother sob story to endear the judges. Well, you're single now. That's entirely different. Well, they don't seem like much of a threat. Are you kidding? Do you remember the Teen Beauty Atlanta pageant 3 years ago? That girl, Kenzie, the one with the terribly shrill voice, she took the title over Lilliana. That was Kenzie's first pageant. No, everybody here is a threat. But I got a bigger problem. Patrice. She's wandering around here like she's already won. Maybe she's just confident. Exactly. I'm not taking any chances. Not for this pageant. You know my family legacy's at risk. So, Patrice will be disqualified when they find out that her precious daughter's on drugs. Slip this into Vivienne's purse when she's not looking. Adeline, I can't do that. I mean, really. Well, then I guess I need to break my silence on your little indiscretion. Adeline, please. Poor Mackenzie, she's just out there bragging about her wedding anniversary. I guess she won't think they're still in the honeymoon phase any longer, when she finds out you've been screwing her husband. How will your family feel when they find out? I will not plant drugs on a teenage girl. That's your choice. Fine. How will anyone even know that Vivienne has drugs in her bag? Don't worry about it, just follow my lead. Unbelievable. Emilia. Hi, Darcy. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. You're Emilia, right? - Mm-hmm. - I'm Adeline. Nice to meet you. Darcy says that you're new to pageants. Yes. Well, you must be so nervous your first time? Oh, I'm certainly a fish out of water here. It's nice to see a new face. I look forward to getting to know you better. - Same. - This tag. Oh, here, let me help you with that. I have got a sewing kit in my purse, and I think it's got some scissors. - Oh. - Here we go. - Ah. - There we go. Oh. Thank you. No problem. Well, it was nice talking to you both. Bye-bye. What is she wearing? My gosh. I can't, it's just too hideous. Hm. Wow, I have never seen anyone eat carbs at one of these things. Really? Really. Welcome to the pageant, where most of these girls just exist off of baby food and laxatives. That sounds very unhealthy. Yeah, no kidding. I'm Mia, by the way. I saw you talking to my mom, Darcy, earlier. I'm Sophie. Nice to meet you. You too. Okay, so that's me, obviously. That's Tatum. That's Lilliana Bordeaux. She won the pageant last year. Her grandmother, Rebecca, she's basically royalty. She's super connected and convinces a bunch of rich people to donate money to the pageant every year. Everyone is so beautiful. Seriously, it's, it's pretty intimidating. Oh my gosh, stop. You are gorgeous too, okay? And you know what? Look, if you want some help practicing your walk, or you just want some pointers, we should exchange numbers. Really? That's so cool of you. Sure, gimme your phone. Who's that? That's Harper. She, um, she died. Oh my God, what, what happened? A few weeks before the last pageant, she was attacked in the parking lot of her gym. That's terrible. Cops said it was a random robbery. Honey, they're ready for us to do our interview. All right, I'll be right there. Okay. Thanks. It's really nice they're doing a mother-daughter pageant this year, don't you think? Absolutely. That's why I really, I hope what I'm hearing is not true. What have you heard? But, you don't know? No. Tell me. Apparently, one of the girls in this room has a serious drug problem. Who? Really? Well, you'll have to excuse me, I completely forgot I need to bring Roberta some hand cream. Mom, what are you doing? Nothing. Okay. Well, they're about to interview us. Oh. Okay. I'll be right there. Okay. Ladies, ladies, gather around. It's wonderful to see you all here looking so lovely. Pageants are about legacy. That's why we decided to host a mother-daughter pageant this season. Our winners bring a wholesome power to the community. They are role models. The current and future leaders of our hometowns, our state, and our world. Ladies, I hope you'll take pride in this awesome responsibility. - Oh God! Oh my gosh! - Oh! Gosh, I'm so sorry. So embarrassing. Here, let me help you pick these things up. Thank you. Goodness, such a klutz. Did you see that? What is this? Hm? Is that drugs? Oh my God, it's true. - Oh my gosh. - Whose purse is that? I think it's Vivienne's. That's not mine. I've never seen that before. That's not mine, I swear. What did you do? - Nothing, Mom. - That is your purse. Somebody must have put that there. Faye, it's not hers. This must be some kind of mistake. I'm sorry, but you two are officially disqualified. Our contestants are supposed to be role models to this community. Mom, this is not fair. Those drugs are not even mine. That is enough. - Faye. - Patrice, I can't. I know. I can't believe that about Vivienne. I've been doing pageants with her forever. Well, call me later, okay? Okay, I will. Sweet. Oh, hey, Darcy, since the girls are planning to get together, maybe we can get together sometime? Grab lunch or... Oh, s- I'm not sure I can, I'm really busy. Just a lot going on. Oh. Okay. Well, if you change your mind. Yeah, sure. Let's go, Mia. - Bye. - Bye. You're helping the competition now? What? I can't make friends? You're always hanging out with Adeline. Get in the car, Mia. Whatever, Mom. Okay, nice and tall, long neck, and go. Good. Engage your core. Don't suck in your stomach and stick out your ribs, you look like a linebacker. Graceful. Honey, you're clomping. Mom, I know how to walk. I won last year, remember? Yeah, thanks to me. What is that supposed to mean? I just mean that I coached you to win. Honey, I know I can be hard on you, but that's just because I see your potential. And we deserve something good, don't we? After your father left us for that trashy- Mom, stop. Dad didn't leave us for anyone. He left because you treated him like garbage. You don't call or knock? No, I own this house, I can come and go as I please. Ah, my beautiful granddaughter. Aah, you are a winner. Can you tell that to Mom? She thinks I need to work on my walk. You're the one who needs to practice. You take a break, sweetie, you're perfection. Hello, Kendra. Hi, Mrs. Bordeaux. Good to see you. You don't need to insult me in front of my own daughter. You haven't competed in over 18 years, and there's some stiff competition. Now, with Patrice and Vivienne out of the pageant, there are nine mother-daughter teams left, including you and Lilliana. I'd keep my eye on these two. The judges watched the interviews and seemed quite interested in our newcomers. Not afraid of a little competition. I watched for years as you lost every single pageant I put you in. That's because you were afraid and weak. I'm not sure that's changed at all. Okay, here we go. Shoulders back. Yep. Head, a little higher. Higher. I know it feels unnatural, but the judges love it. Yeah. Okay, here we go. Mm-hmm. Good. Look, thank you so much for helping me, especially since you're competition. I'm not exactly trying to win. Why is that? You have to promise not to tell anybody. I won't. I caught my mom cheating on my dad. Oh my God. Yeah. And I can't tell my dad, even though I want to, but it would break him, you know? So, I'm going to get back at my mom in a different way. How? If there's anything my mom loves in this world, it's pageants. When she found out this one was for mothers and daughters, I'd literally never seen her so happy. But after what she did to my dad, I just can't help her win. Oh, you're going to throw the competition? Mm-hmm. But I'm gonna wait till the next cut. Let us get to the final five, where she can almost touch the crown, and then make it all go away. Wow, that probably sounds really crazy, right? Hey, I don't judge And that's why I like you. And why I want you to win. Okay, so what are you wearing to the next event? I don't know. Uh... This is probably the dressiest thing I own. No, no, you can't wear that. Um, there is a local boutique that sponsors the pageant. They send over a bunch of dresses to the contestants every year, so you should call Faye. She'll let you know when you can drop by pageant headquarters and try some on. Cool, thanks. You're welcome. Yeah, probably a good call. Yeah, don't, don't wear that. Hm. Mm. Ah, you look so pretty, Mom. Oh, thanks, honey. Mm, I don't like the way the dress fits me. No? No. I think I'm gonna just try a different one on. Okay. What's wrong? The deposit is overdue for the literature residency. I already asked for an extension, but since they have a wait-list, they don't wanna be flexible. I'll give them a call and see if there's something we can work out, okay? Yeah. Thanks, Mom. Oh, Emilia. I'm sorry, Faye gave me this time. She didn't mention anybody else was back here. Oh, we're just wrapping up. Oh. Hmm, that dress looks amazing on you. Thank you. Looks a little loose though. Hmm? Feels okay. Yeah, ideally, you wanted to accentuate your curves. Here, let me show you. Oh yeah, you could take this in about an inch. - Ouch! - Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. You okay, Mom? I was just making some tailoring suggestions. - Ugh. - See? But you don't look so wide. - Hm. - Yeah. It's good, right? But I don't understand. Hey, Mom, do you think these earrings would go with the dress I got. Section two, paragraph five. Is there any way I can appeal the decision? Yes, you can reach out to Mr. Ginley personally. Okay. Sure, I'll try giving him a call. What's wrong? I just found out that insurance may not cover the damages at the spa. I can try to appeal the decision, but that'll take time and delay the opening even longer. Or we could win the pageant and you'll have all the money you'll need. I love your optimism, honey. Are these worthy of a crown? Hm? Yes. No. Okay, maybe I'll go back to the drawing board. You are worthy of the crown. - Come here. - Aw. I love you. Now put 'em on. Okay. ♪ Ah ha ♪ All right ♪ I don't feel anything ♪ Oh yeah ♪ Tonight Hey, Sophie and Emilia. Come on, you two, let me show you where to put your stuff. Thanks. We've got a big day ahead, so I hope you're ready. You can hang your dresses up here. - Mm-hmm. - Things down over here. Changing room's upstairs. Come on, I want you to meet Rebecca Bordeaux. - Okay. - Okay. Hey. Hey, here you are. Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. I had something to take care of. Ladies! Ladies! Everyone, we have a very special guest joining us today. Rebecca Bordeaux! Rebecca is one of our biggest supporters, and we are thrilled to have her with us. She generously connected us to the owners of this beautiful space who lent it to us for the pageant this year. And she secured all donors for the $100,000 prize. Oh. Hello and welcome, everyone, to this first ever regional Atlanta mother-daughter pageant. I want you all to know that everyone is given a fair opportunity to win. I have no say in the outcome of this pageant. Now, some of you are more seasoned with many titles, and others are here for their first try. And others have competed many times and haven't won yet. The strongest contestants, the ones who get the crown, focus on their own strengths. I wish you all the very best of luck. Hm, I love you all. Oh my God, it's ruined. Who would do this? It looks like somebody took a pair of scissors to my gown. - That's really terrible. - Oh my gosh. - It wasn't me. - No one's gonna fess up? Emilia had a pair of scissors in her purse. What? I, I absolutely did not do that. How dare you accuse me? Who do you think you are? What is all the commotion back here? My dress. Somebody in this room destroyed it. Well, before we start throwing accusations, let's think- Faye, let me talk with my daughter. Adeline. - What? - Come here. What? Faye, I am not responsible for this. Don't worry, we'll figure this out. Mother! What the hell are you doing? I could ask you the same question. I know what you're up to, Adeline. You're trying to chip off your competition. That Emilia woman, she just shredded my gown. You are accusing me? I take it you didn't know that there were security cameras back there. There's no cameras in the dressing room. Of course not, but there are in the makeup area, where the dresses are hanging. You're lucky I am the one who secured this space for the pageant. Now, do I need to go to the office and rewind the footage to see what really happened? Or would you rather I just erase it? Hm? That's what I thought. I have a reputation to protect, and that's the only reason I'm getting you out of this mess. You will not put shame on this family legacy, do you hear me? Now, you're gonna go back in there and tell everyone you made a mistake. Tell them, tell them you fired your housekeeper this morning and before you left, she retaliated by shredding your gown. No. No, Mother, no. Nobody's gonna buy that. Th-there's a piece of my dress stuck on Emilia's scissors. This is not up for debate. - Go. - Oh my God. Ladies, I apologize. I made the wrong assumption. Unfortunately, I had to let my housekeeper go earlier today and I had no idea she would be this vindictive. I'm just glad you figured out what happened. Do you have somethin' else to wear? Rosewood Boutique is gonna rush me over a new gown. Perfect. Now that we have that cleared up, the judges are on their way in. Please, everyone, get ready and meet me in the main room. We start in half an hour. Mom, there is no way Kendra would destroy your dress. Lilliana, I don't need your input right now. You're gonna do fine, honey. If anyone should be nervous, it's me. I haven't done this piece in almost 10 years. You're gonna do great. Thank you, honey. Everyone, please gather around. I am pleased to introduce our judges. Let's give a warm round of applause for Cyrus Price. Franklin Davis. And Vanessa Handler. Thank you. The judges have watched your interview tape. Today they are going to watch you perform for the preliminary competition. After, they're going to decide on the final five pairs. Lilliana, you're up first. Bravo, honey! ♪ So here we go ♪ Yeah, cranking up the beat ♪ Rolling down the street ♪ All night, it's now or never ♪ Here we go again ♪ Here we go again ♪ Now or never ♪ If you want it ♪ Take your best shot ♪ If you need it ♪ Give me all you got ♪ Don't hold back ♪ Don't surrender ♪ It's gonna be a night to remember ♪ ♪ Yeah, here we go again ♪ Cranking up the beat ♪ Rolling down the street ♪ All night, it's now or never ♪ Here we go again ♪ Here we go again Sophie, it's your turn. You're gonna do great. Uh? What's wrong, honey? My poem, it, it, was right here. It's gotta be down here somewhere. It's gone. I... Hey, hey, hey, look, you've got this. You've got this many times. You wrote it. Deep breath. Go get 'em. This is a poem I wrote for my father. "Lightly they pass, lifting the mist. Burying a golden leaf. Color no longer green." Um... The... Um... I'm sorry, I, um, I had a copy of my poem, but I must have misplaced it. It's okay, you're fine. If you qualify for the next round, just bring an extra copy with you at the pageant final. It's gonna be okay. It's okay. I think I just ruined our chances. No, you did not. You're okay. I just need some air. Sophie. Seriously, do not sweat that. I just blew it in there. Look, don't worry about it, okay? They're picking the final five today. Sophie, anything can happen. Trust me. Are you going to the pageant sleepover tomorrow night? I didn't even know about it. Tatum. She always tries to leave the new girls out. It's at her house, her parents are really rich. It's actually kinda fun. Okay, yeah, I'll go, unless I get cut today. Sophie, it's not just for the final five. Come on, they're about to announce the winners. Okay. Moving ahead in the competition are Mackenzie and Tatum. Ah! Oh my God. We got this. Darcy and Mia. Roberta and Scarlett. Adeline and Lilliana. Yes! I told you, honey. And finally, Emilia and Sophie. Oh my God. This is great. We did it! - Yeah. - We did it. Congratulations. Let's give a warm round of applause to our five mother-daughter finalists. What have I been telling you? Emilia and her daughter are a real threat. I hear you, Mother. You better step things up. Emilia Connors, you are one impressive violinist. Oh, thank you. You look familiar. Were you a vendor at the town Christmas market last year? Yes, I was. I bought a basket from you, a gift for my ma. Some spa products. - Mm. - She loved them. You know, you should really think about opening up a place here in town. I am opening a spa, actually. Hopefully, within the next six weeks. That's great. You know, I've been watching you. Oh? Oh, that came out wrong. I mean, in the pageant. Mm. It's just refreshing to have contestants who aren't so rehearsed, you know what I mean? I think I do, and thank you. Ugh. What does Cyrus even see in Emilia anyway? She's so plain. And her violin skills, hm, not great. She's opening up a spa, but have you seen her skin? She looks 10 years older than she is. I have to do something before the judge's luncheon. I can't risk them spending any more time together. I need to solve this problem on my own. What do you mean? I have to get Cyrus to vote for me. How? I have my ways. You're not gonna do anything to Emilia or Sophie. - Adeline, I can't - Enough. Darcy, stop your blabbering, I need your help. You're still a member of Seasons Country Club, right? Y- yes. The manager is an old college friend. I invited you to check it out, but you- I didn't care about that tacky place then, but I did some research and I found out that Cyrus plays pickleball there with a friend. And you can get me in as a guest, right? Yes. Good. Oh! Mm! I think I need a break. Hm. Oh. Get over here. Cyrus. Oh, hello, Adeline. Well, I didn't know you were a member here. Yes, I enjoy it here, um, it's less stuffy than the other clubs around the area. Are you a member? Oh, I'm thinking about joining. - Oh. - But I came along with Darcy. Hmm. That's nice. Hello. Can we interest you guys in a game? I appreciate the offer, but, uh, I had knee surgery earlier this year. Yeah, I gotta take it easy for now. - Mm. - Well, we understand. Well, we're gonna go grab a drink. Nice to see you. - Okay. - Nice meeting you. - Bye. - Bye-Bye. Perfect. He's getting a drink. Good, I could really use a glass of wine. No, I gotta do this alone, I, I can't risk, like, your distractions. Oh, um, well, I guess I could go- Talk to a manager of the club. Yes. Why? 'Cause you won't stop bragging that you know him. My God, are you sleeping with him too? Don't. No! Do whatever you want, just don't get in the way of my plan. We meet again. Do you mind if I take a seat? Uh, sure. Where's Darcy? Oh, she's off yapping to the manager of the club, and apparently they're old friends from college. So, what are we drinking? Uh, whiskey, neat. Sounds delicious. So, how are you enjoying the pageant so far? You know what? I think it's going great. There are some really impressive contestants. Hmm, that's good to hear. Mm-hmm. You know, pageants have been around for a very long time in my family. My mother was Miss Teen- Oh, I'm aware of who your mother is. She's a legend. So many crowns. What's a girl got to do to get a drink around here? Oh, you know, I think she'll be right back. You mind if I take a sip of yours? Uh, sure. Hmm. You know, I think it's a great group this year. There's a lot of very experienced contestants. Me. And those new to the competition as well. Yes. Emilia and Sophie. Huh, it's nice to have newcomers, don't you think? You know, I wouldn't have imagined that they're new to pageant competitions. One thing I can say, it is a very tight race so far. Enough shoptalk, how about another round, hm? Girls, I am so happy to have you all here for my annual pageant sleepover. Yes! Now, everyone in here has made it to the top five. But let's face it, no matter who wins, we are all winners. - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo! Anyway, let's go ahead and drink up before my parents get home and we get caught drinking their booze. Yeah, we should. Cheers. Here's to watching our mothers try to recapture their youth and not go absolutely insane. - Cheers to survive. - Cheers. Yes! Yes! Thank you for agreeing to show me around. I think I'm gonna get a membership here after all. Well, maybe next time I'll take you up on that pickleball match. I'm gonna hold you to it. Well, it's getting late. Oh, are you heading home so soon? Adeline, what are you doing? Well, the night is still young. Adeline! I think we both have interests that could benefit one another. Are you trying to bribe me? Because if you are, you should know that's an automatic disqualification. Wait, this is a big misunderstanding. No, I, I don't think it is. I mean, can't you tell when you're barking up the wrong tree, Adeline? I'm sorry, but the rules are the rules. I'm gonna have to report this. What? You're gonna report this? Yes. Do you really think that I need to proposition a judge in order to win? Do you know who I am? I do. You're Rebecca Bordeaux's daughter, and that does not make you untouchable. Oh. - Adeline? - Cyrus. - Adeline? - Cyrus. Adeline? - I'm very touchable. - Adeline? Touch. Hey, Dad, I got your message. I really wish I could fly out and see you, but with all this pageant stuff, Mom would kill me. But thank you for the invite, and I really hope I see you when you're back in town. Love you. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, it's just, um... Do you wanna talk about it? It's my dad's birthday this week, and he's in Montreal for work. He works at this, like, big tech company, but he was gonna fly me out and sightsee and get dinner and all of that stuff. That's so cool. Yeah, but, I mean, I'm not going. Because of the pageant. It would be a quick trip, and it doesn't interfere with any of the events, but my mom would, like, freak out. It's like any time I wanna spend time with my dad it just ends up in, like, a screaming match with her. She doesn't want you to spend time with him at all? It must be hard on you. I'm just trying to keep the peace until I can graduate and get the hell outta here. Well, is he at least coming to the pageant final? No, that's my mom's turf. But, we should head back inside. Yeah. Darcy seems very distracted. What's that all about? I don't know. Shame about what happened to that judge. Yeah. I got word before he died that he was quite fond of Emilia and Sophie. Pity for them. But lucky break for you. I don't need a judge to die in order to win, Mother. But now that he's taken care of. That's an odd way to phrase it. I just mean that if he so clearly favored certain contestants, the playing field's open again. And you want Lilliana and I to win more than anything, right, Mother? Hello, Faye. Adeline, I just got back into the office and now is not the best time. This will only take a few moments. I wanted to discuss the appointments of the new judge. A man just died, Adeline, have some compassion. I'm working on finding a new replacement. It just so happens I have someone you should consider. His name is Warren Sandler. He's an upstanding businessman, on the board of several organizations here in Atlanta. You know him? Um... We support a few of the same charities. As you know, I'm very involved in the community. It would be a conflict of interest to appoint a judge that you know personally. Besides, I have a few people in mind already. My mother's a big fan of Warren, and between you and I, she's planning to secure double the funding for next year. I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but I'm sure it would go a long way if you appoint the judge that she wants. Faye called, she said that they selected a new judge. Warren Sandler. Interesting choice. Careful with that, dear. Caffeine gives you cellulite. Faye was acting as if I would be thrilled with her selection of Warren. Do you know anything about that? No, Mother, I don't. Well, I have some interesting news. The pageant hasn't officially announced it yet, but a television crew is coming to film the dress rehearsal. Really? Why not the pageant itself? Well, they're doing it documentary style, showing the behind-the-scenes. Faye will be doing a presentation highlighting my past wins. Of course. All eyes will be on the legacy I built for our family. You understand that? What do you expect me to do? Prove that you can win something for once in your life. Okay, Franklin is over there, and Vanessa is there. This feels so awkward. Like what, are we supposed to just go over there and sell ourselves? I think we can just start with a simple hello. We'll do it together. Okay. So, you ready to schmooze the judges? Not, not really. Hey, you'll be great. Kind of sad about that guy, Cyrus, though. My parents belong to the same country club where he died. And no surprise that Adeline's already cozying up to the new judge. It's a tragedy what happened with Cyrus, but I'm glad something wonderful could come out of it. I'm so excited that you're the new judge. Yeah, me too. You know you've already got my vote. It's the other two judges I'd worry about. What do, what do you mean? Well, I had a conversation with Franklin and Vanessa, seems they're both very endeared to the newcomers over there. Excuse me. Excuse me. Vanessa! - Adeline. - Hi. I'm sorry, I need to make an important phone call. Can we regroup inside in a bit? Yeah, I was hoping I could get you alone. All right, I guess I have a few minutes. I read an article that you are considering a run for local office. That's right. Well, our family's very active in supporting candidates. In fact, everyone we've backed has won. And? Well, I'm just saying we both have something we wanna win here. You're not attempting to bribe me, are you, Adeline? Oh, no, no, of course not. Um, I'm just pointing out that we both have mutual interests. Right. If you'll excuse me. No. Aw. You know what she said. I need you. - Ouch, Mom, what the hell? - Stop fraternizing with your competition and go impress the judges. Come with me. It's good to see you again, Franklin. You remember my daughter, Lilliana? Hi, nice to see you. Always a pleasure. What are you majoring in next year at college? Finance. You know, I offer internships at my company. That'd be perfect for you, honey. You guys should exchange numbers. I already have a full course load, but thank you. Well, in case you change your mind. That's my personal cell number on there. - Lilliana. - Mom. What the hell was that? He's a prominent businessman, you'd be lucky to intern with him. You didn't see the way he was leering at me? You're a pageant girl. You parade your body on stage, you don't want a man to look at you? Just when I thought you couldn't get any worse. So, how do you think it went? That Warren guy was pretty hard to read, and Franklin was kind of friendly. A little too friendly for my liking. I know. I'm gonna use the restroom really quick. Ooh, here, let me help you with that. Uh-huh, thank you, thank you. Of course. Ugh, wow. I'm a bit of a mess today. Is everything okay? No. My mother is ill and I just called to check in and... But I understand. I lost my husband to cancer recently. I remember you mentioned that during your interview. I'm so sorry. Thank you. I think it's nice that you and your daughter are doing this pageant together for the first time, after such a big loss. What made you enter? Truthfully, we really need the money. I'm drowning in medical bills from my husband, I'm a new business owner, and that takes time to build, and my daughter has this incredible opportunity to study in London, but the cost is just more than... I'm, I'm sorry, I shouldn't be laying this all on you. No, no, I completely understand. I've had my share financial issues in the past. It's not always easy, especially after losing someone you love. Thank you. Just, I don't understand why aren't these judges so impressed with Emilia and Sophie? Uh, at least Cyrus is gone. Well, that's kind of an awful thing to say, isn't it? The man died. But he wasn't gonna vote for me. Adeline, please tell me you had nothing to do with his death. Are you accusing me? No, no, no, I am sorry, I just know how much you want the crown. You're really not someone who should be throwing stones, Darcy. What do you mean? I never hurt anybody. Oh, cheating on your husband isn't hurting him? Instead of these accusations, you should be helping me. That's our deal. What am I supposed to do? - Is somebody there? - Shh. I don't see anybody. Let's get back, we can talk later. - Oh, this is cute. - I love that. - Sorry, um. - Hey. Hey, can I talk to you for a minute in private? Yeah, sure. - Bye. - See ya. What's up? Adeline knows about your mom's affair. Why would she tell her? Adeline is a huge gossip. Maybe she didn't and Adeline found out on her own. I heard them arguing about something, said they had a deal, that she should help her. Why would she do that? I don't know. But you remember how I said I was going to put a stop to all this? Perfect timing. Right. Yes. Mom, can I talk to you for a second? Honey, why aren't you out there socializing with the judges? I'll give you two a moment. I have to show you something. Can't it wait until later? We only have so much time with the judges. No, it can't. Where did you get this? I took it. When? Not that long ago. The Italian restaurant around the corner. When you lied to Dad, said that you had errands to run. I cannot believe you're sleeping with Tatum's dad, Mom. How can you stand there just talking and laughing with Mackenzie? Shh. Honey, I am so sorry. Mom, how could you do that? I'm so sorry. How can I make this up to you? - Honey, please. - Make it up to me? You can walk over there and tell Faye that we quit the pageant. - No. - Do it right now, Mom, or I send this photo to every single person in this room. Honey, please. Why do you wanna quit? We're... I am not telling Dad about the affair, it would crush him. But I am not doing this anymore. And maybe if you get out of this crazy pageant world, you'll remember what's really important. My father went into hospice. We don't know how much longer he has left. Oh, Darcy, I am so sorry. Of course, we're disappointed to lose you both from the competition. Please let us know if there's anything that we can do. Whoa, what's happening? My life is over. That's dramatic. Mia found out about the affair. Ugh, I told you, you're being too sloppy. She found a photo of us, and she threatened to expose me if I don't drop outta the pageant. It's her way of getting back at me. Tough break. That's it? That's all you're gonna say to me? Darcy, we're connected by the pageant, it's not like we have a friendship outside of this world. Mia, where are you going? Why don't you ask your mom? What? I'm sorry, Lilliana. I like you, we're friends, but your mom is not a nice person. And I'm sorry to say that, but there is something seriously wrong with her. I've lived with her for 18 years. I know. Just, what did she do? Well, for starters, she's blackmailing my mom. Are you serious? Mm-hmm. What does she even want from her? I don't know exactly, but I hope you figure it out soon, before things get worse. I gotta go. Okay. See ya. Hey, um, have you seen Mia? She, she just left. Do you know what's going on between her and my mom? Sophie, please, if you know something you have to tell me. Darcy, are you okay? No. And Emilia, you should watch your back. I like the color of this dress. But this dress looks way more flattering on you. Let's try them both on. Lilliana, what's your problem? Get with it, we're down to the wire. I'm doing all the work. What work are you doing, Mom? Excuse me? Oh, let me guess, your father's in your ear again, poisoning you against me. No, you do a good enough job of that yourself. He always resented pageants. He never supported your dreams. That is not true. Oh, really, then why wasn't he at your last pageant, when you won the crown? Because he was stuck at work with an emergency. You remember that. All of the servers went down. No. Lilliana, he was holed up in some hotel with his assistant. No, Mom, that's not true. You know that's not true. Dad didn't cheat on you. Come on, Lilliana, you are not a stupid girl. No, Mom, I'm not. You know what? I don't like either of these for you. I'm gonna call the boutique and have them send over some more options. You reached Patrick. Leave a message, I'll get back to you. Hey, Dad, can you give me a call back? It's about Mom. - Hey. - Hey, how's it going? Well, my mom is devastated that I made her quit the pageant. But other than that, everything's great. What's up with you? I was looking through some articles about that girl, Harper. Harper? Really? Why? Don't you think it's weird that she was killed so close to the pageant last year? Well, it was awful, but what do you mean by weird? Did the police ever suspect anyone from the pageant? Um, the case was closed as a random robbery pretty quickly. I mean, they talked to all of us girls and our parents, but I never got the feeling they thought any of us did it. Was, was the pageant unusually intense that year or something? No, it was just a normal amount of tension, I would say. Although, there was this one thing Harper was worried about. What was it? Well, you know that judge, Franklin, apparently he came on to her and she rejected him. Harper was worried that people would think she was favorite to win. Did any of the other contestants know that? Well, there were rumors, but it was squashed pretty quickly. So, certain contestants knew that Harper was favored by Franklin? Exactly. And what if Adeline was one of those people? Hey, remember, you said Cyrus was really complimentary of us, right? Yeah. Did Adeline know that? It's possible. Mom, if Adeline is responsible for Cyrus or Harper's death, we have to do something. Oh, it's Lilliana. She wants to talk. I didn't tell her about Darcy's affair yesterday because I felt like that was Mia's place to decide whether she should know or not. Right. But she seemed really upset about her mom. You know what? Speaking of Darcy, I think I should pay her a visit today. Try to figure out exactly why she was warning me about Adeline. Do you think she'll talk to you? It's worth a try. - Hi. - Emilia. What are you doing here? This really isn't a good time. I just wanted to talk about yesterday. Do you know? About your affair? - Yes. - Shh. My husband is home, please, I haven't told him. I have no intentions of revealing your personal business. I just wanted to know what you meant when you were warning me to watch my back around Adeline. I'm sorry, Emilia, I really shouldn't be talking to you about Adeline. Why are you so scared of her? Is it because of your affair, or something else? Okay, please. Look, I don't know anything for sure. Darcy, mother to mother, if Adeline has done something awful, you don't want her hurting anyone else, right? Adeline was at the country club the night Cyrus died. I left early, she stayed. Why was she there? Because she believes he favored you and Sophie. - Ugh. - She wanted to convince him otherwise. Do you think she killed him? I can't be involved. No, no, wait. Hey, hey. Hey, okay. Does the country club have security cameras? I don't know, but my friend, he's the manager there, he said the police have already looked into this. Can you just ask him and see? He's on vacation right now, but I'll do my best to reach him. Okay. Thank you. Is it about the footage from the country club? Darcy spoke to the manager. Someone on the maintenance crew set up trail cameras to watch for animals that could cause damage to the course. Apparently they're going through the footage, but it's gonna take time. Time that we don't have. Come on. ♪ Ooh-Hoo-hoo We've got 45 minutes dress rehearsal, everyone. Mom, guess what? Oh, Lilliana, not right now. You're gonna want to hear this. I just got us Franklin's vote. What? How do you know? I took your advice. Had a, you know, productive conversation with him. He assured me his vote was ours. Oh... Okay. Glad to see you're comin' around, honey. All right, now that we have Warren's vote and Franklin's vote, I guess we have nothing to worry about then. Yeah, we're good. I'm gonna go put some lipstick on before we go on camera. Sounds good. She bought it. Okay, at least we don't have to worry about your mom thinking we're a threat. Yeah, you guys are good. - Okay. - I'll see you back there. Okay. Hi, sweetheart. Everything okay? Yeah, Grandma. Why? You seem to have been a bit off these past few days. I, I just think it's stress from the pageant. I mean, you know how that is, right? You sure there's nothing else going on that I should be aware of? No, everything is fine. Well, then thank you for carrying this pageant for you and your mother. I think we both know who the real star of the family is. - I love you, sweetheart. - Hm, I love you. - I'm gonna go get ready. - Okay. Good luck. Hey, I'll be right back. Darcy, any news? They found something. There is clear footage of Adeline and Cyrus walking together close to where he died. Can you send that to me? I'll text it over. Are you gonna turn this into the police? Yes, but it doesn't really prove anything. There's no real footage of Adeline doing it. The police will question her, but if it's not enough for an arrest, I am terrified of what she'll do then. Sophie! Why are you fumbling around? I can't find my shoes. Well, can you look a bit more quietly and on your side? I'd like some peace before we go on camera. Sophie, did you leave them in the car? I'll go check. Can, can I help you? Oh, hi, um... Hi, I'm Lilliana's father. Are, are you one of the contestants? Yeah. I'm Sophie. Yeah, Lilliana told me about you. She told me everything. And if it's all true, if Adeline really hurt someone, I just gotta make sure Lilliana's okay. Then why are you sneaking around the building? Well, I'm trying to find the best way in, because if I call Lilliana, or if I text her and my ex-wife sees it, she will lose it. Okay, just wait right here. Okay. Thank you. Hey, your dad is here. Oh my God, he came. - My gosh, Dad! - Hi. What are you doing? I thought you were in Montreal? I left early. I cannot leave you alone with your mother. Thank you. So, Darcy sent over the footage, and it does prove your mom was with Cyrus that night, near where his body was found. Okay, you guys, we have to go to the police. I agree, but Darcy doesn't think it's enough evidence, and I'm with her on that. All right, so what do we do? Adeline thinks she's gonna win, her guard is down. The dress rehearsal will be broadcast live. If we can work together, we might be able to get a confession out of her. How? What if we play the video in front of everyone? I mean, Dad, you're obviously good with technology, you could probably hook it up to the main stage. I mean, yeah. I think we have to try. Let's do it. Okay. Come on, come on, come on. Yes. Take your places, ladies. You look beautiful. Right along there. That's right. There we go. And we're just about ready. Ah, this is my moment. I mean, ours. I think it will be. Ladies and gentlemen, it's showtime. I'd like to thank our audience at home for watching us live right now. This is the first time we've given a behind the scenes look to you, and we couldn't be more excited. Before we get started, I'd like to welcome a true icon of our pageant community without whose generous support this evening would not be possible. The winner of an unprecedented 17 pageant crowns, the one, the only, Rebecca Bordeaux. To celebrate Rebecca's lifetime of accomplishments, on and offstage, we've put together a special presentation to honor her incredible legacy. What is that. Faye, what's going on? Uh, uh, I'm so sorry, I don't know why this is playin'. Is that Adeline and Cyrus? Isn't that where he died? What is the meaning of this? Uh, I... This video is obviously a fake. - Mom. - Hey, hey, stop. - Turn it off. - Mom! Off. Turn it, turn it off! Right now! Right now! Mom, stop! Everyone knows your lying. I'm so sorry, everyone. I don't condone this kind of behavior from my daughter. If you just give us a few moments. Ouch, Mom. Adeline, let go of her. Get off me. This is, you are doing, isn't it? You're trying to turn my daughter against me so that you can win? All right, all right, that's enough. That's enough, turn off those cameras right now. - Keep rolling. - Turn off that camera now! Sorry, Mrs. Bordeaux. I'm here to broadcast what happens backstage at a dress rehearsal. The cameras are staying on. Do not turn that camera off. You killed Cyrus, didn't you? Because he wasn't going to vote for you? How dare you accuse me of something like that. And then he was replaced by Warren. Faye, what made you appoint him to replace Cyrus? Uh... He came highly recommended. Oh, please, by who? Adeline? Ugh, I'm gonna sue you for defamation of character. This woman has never done a pageant in her life, and she shows up this year. Clearly, she has a vendetta against me. Mom, stop lying! Stop! I did not raise you like this. You are acting like your father. Adeline. Enough! If you'll all excuse me for a few moments, I need some time to deal with family. Mother, I need you outside. Stop! You're not leaving until you tell us what happened to Harper. What about her? You killed her too, didn't you? You tried to stage it as a robbery. You little bitch! Don't you ever come near my daughter! Adeline! Adeline, stop this right now! You are a disgrace, a stain on our family. Get out of my sight. Doesn't that make you happy? After all these years, you finally got what you've always wanted. A daughter who's exactly like you. I should stab you in your miserable heart! But you won't. Can't even do that right. Oh no, you're not going anywhere. I did this for you. I killed Harper and Cyrus because of you. Because you never gave me any choice. You created all of this. Why aren't you on my side? Why won't you love me? What is it about me? You've never put me first. Why, Mom? My God. Rebecca, do you have any comments about what's transpired tonight? No comment. She's not worth a single word. M- mom, get back here! No! Listen, thank you both for having me over this morning. Of course. We're glad you came by. So, I'm sure you both heard that the pageant has been shut down for good. - Mm-hmm. - But you had my vote. So, Emilia, how's everything going with your spa? Oh, excellent. Insurance finally came through to fix the damage, so we should be up and running and on schedule. Yeah, I'm so happy to hear that. Thank you. And Sophie, how about your literature residency? Uh, unfortunately, we were unable to scrape the money together. I can help. I'd love to sponsor your residency. What? Wait, what? Are, are you sure? Absolutely. You deserved that win. It's my pleasure to help out. Oh, Mom! That is so generous of you, Vanessa. Thank you, truly. Thank you so much. My pleasure. - Ah, you're going to London. - I'm going to London. Yes! - Let's do a cheers. - Yeah! - To London. - To London! I've been to London many times. So what's the first thing you wanna see? Gosh, I mean, I don't know. Everything.
