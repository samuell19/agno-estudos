Machine translated with some minor/obvious fixes. The Innocents. Henriette, have you brought my tools? What did you say? -Did you bring my tools? No. I think it's in the car. You know how Anna is. She can't stand new things. Dad can stay with Anna anyway. Then we can go on holiday. I can buy magazines at the airport. Dad can't take a vacation at the moment because of his new job. And I have a lot of work here. Come on, it's gonna be fun. You will make new friends at school. It's nice to have new friends, isn't it? But everyone is on vacation. -No. Not everyone. Now you must sleep. Good night. I do not want to sleep. Okay then. Fine. You can say awake. Won't you stay with me for a while? No, but I can leave the door open. So, now I can hear you. Good night. Hi. Are you new here? -Yes. Can I show you something? What? Where I used to live, I had built a tree house. I also had a slingshot, with which I shot 'all of my enemies'. Did you move? -Yes very often. Hold on and stand there. Okay. Should I throw it? -No, just drop it. Are you ready? -Yes. Now. We need to find something lighter. Finished? -Yes. Now. How do you do that? I have practiced a lot. -Again. Finished? Now. Can I have a try? -Yes. Concentrate well, okay? Now. It did not work. See what I can. That's just scary. Can you move these? -No. I do. It flew sideways. Does he use a slingshot? No. He made it move by himself. Be careful with slingshots. Can he do magic? -Yes. cool. -What is that? There was also football. Well done. Put it down. I was not allowed to participate. The teams must have been complete. I will do it. Maybe you can help me? I'll take that pillow. Oh my ass. A chair. Look. A chair. Come here then. Like this. Dad is waiting for us. We have to go. Always so busy. Yes, you have. My hair is a little thicker than yours, I think. And my hair is much darker than yours. Look what a difference in color. I am much darker than you. Like this. I expressed myself badly. No one has more beautiful hair than anyone else. Sorry. Sit still or I can't brush your hair. Mama? I myself have worked as a registered nurse. So I notice changes quickly. Doesn't she say anything? No expressive language? No, she just makes some noises. She used to speak. Wasn't her diagnosis at the age of four? -Yes, but it started before that. She talked a lot and then gradually she lost her ability to speak. Wasn't that to get attention? No, as a three-year-old she talked through everything. Shall I show you around, Anna? Do you like to play? That's a lot of blood, you say. Come... Sit down. Anna? What happened? But that's glass. Susu. Susu? Would you like to go for a walk with Anna? -No. On the playground in front of the door. -No, I don't feel like it. Good night. -Good night. Mom? -Yes? When I pray, may I do so in my own words? Yes, you can pray in your own words. Maybe you can pray for daddy too? Can I just lie down and listen? What do you mean? -Just listen? Yes. But that is not the same as praying. I think so. -Okay. But good night. Go to sleep now. -Good night. We go to many places. We also go to the city. With my friends and their little brother. You can't say that. That is very badly done. I have to tell. Is that your sister? She is autistic. Stop. Look. Can't she see? -Yes. She's just a little weird. Do you squeeze hard? -Yes. Shall we go play? Will you sit here for a while? We're going for a walk. That way she can sit for a very long time. Hey. What are you doing? Do you want to have the ball? Do you want it? Hi. Is that your cat? -No, he arrived yesterday. Psst, Jabba. I just call him Jabba. Hey, Jabba. Even higher? -Yes. Would he be dead? Shall we finish him? -What do you mean? Do not. Did you hear that? He's hot. Where are you going? -I have to go home. Anna, come on, we have to go. Anna, come. She wants to stay. Yes, but we have to go. come. Do you want me to come? Can you take her tomorrow? I do not know yet. come. -She wants that. I can ask. Can I take Anna with me today? Do you want that? Does that make you happy? can we go? Yes, if you stay on the playground. Is your phone charged? And. How many? Five? A castle. Two. Three. Four. We have to go. Did you? -No she. That's not going to work. It's way too big. -We're trying. Stand there. Stand together. It works better together. Are you ready? Anna couldn't do it alone. Well with you. Hi, what are you doing? Can you do that too? -No. So just her and me? -But... you can hear Anna, right? -Yes. And she can hear me too. -Do you hear me? No, but him a little. What do you hear? Just something. But with her I feel it all the time. We think the same. We think together. Are you ready? -Yes. Banana. Banana? -Correct. Did you hear that? -No. Can you do the same with Anna? -I can try it. Ready? -Yes. No. Banana banana. What does that mean? -Two bananas. Try again. And you don't say anything, okay? Ready? -Yes. Banana. -Correct. I cheated. I used her. It's easy with her. I can't do anything, me. You go all the way up, then we go down? Hi. Okay, we're coming. See you soon. We forgot to eat. We have to go home now. Bye. -Bye. How long were you gone. Was it fun? -Yes of course. What's the dessert? -An icecream. Mama? Shark. Mom, can I watch TV? That's bigger. Who are you talking to? With nobody. I'm talking to someone who isn't here. Answer. Hi. Hi. Benjamin, answer me when I talk to you. Answer. Where are you doing? What's that mess here? Hello? Everything fine? There was someone in the room. No, that must have been the TV. Come on, let's go to sleep. I'll sit next to you for a moment. Sweetie. Try to go even further. Down. Ben is a shit kid. Ben is a shit kid. You can't laugh at someone. She laughed at me. No. Are you sure? No. That hurts. Stop. Go away. Go away. -Bitch. She doesn't feel anything. -Yes. Then why isn't she crying? She never cries. She is crying inside. Yes, you can. Just talk out loud like me. Yes, you can. You just have to pronounce it, like me. No... You can do it. No... Now you talk. Now you're talking. Hi. Hi. Does it hurt a lot? It... It stings. Mom? -Hey. What happened? She fell. Is everything alright? Come, I'll take off your shoes. Oh my God. That must hurt a lot. What did you do? She fell while walking. -On the playground? Don't mess with me. This is not due to a fall. What happened? Tell. I asked you something. What happened? Can I not trust you at all? I'm fine. -Not true. She must be in a lot of pain. Come on, baby. Mom will take care of you. It'll be fine. Within. Hi. Sorry I was so strict. It's not your duty to babysit Anna. It's nice that you want to do this. But that's a lot of responsibility. So it's my fault. What do you all do when you are out for so long? Everything. I don't always remember. But what happened today? You weren't on the playground, were you? I won't get angry. I know you wanted to babysit her. I just want to know what happened. Mama? Anna is doing better. -Oh yeah? She's playing and she can already say things. She can talk. It's true. You can't joke about that. I do not do that. Just stop it. Say something. -That's enough, Ida. Who is that? Can you tell who that is? Mother. Mother. Come on, you were almost there. Say it. - Now stop. Say it. - Stop it, I said. You get one more chance to tell how Anna got hurt. No? Then I can no longer trust Anna to you. Understood? I do not care. ouch. Damn. Is that why you laugh? Do you know how much that hurts? What the hell is it... Aisha and I are doing well. But I'm tired. I work day and night. And. Mom? -What? You bleed. You bleed. -What? You bleed here. Stop. -But you're bleeding from your forehead. I'm not bleeding, Aisha. Stop fooling around. That's my daughter, Aisha. Now I can hear you again. I've heard about it. Benjamin. You need to call someone... You have to call... You have to call... Hi. Anna? Anna? We'll clean it up. We'll clean it up. We are playing. We are playing. We'll clean it up, Mom. We will do that. Everything is fine? What is it? Everything is fine. What is this? What is this? What do they call that? What's this called? Tutu, tutu. Give her some time. She's a little tired. She doesn't like it. What is this? Can you tell what this is? Where I drink from. Glass. Glass. Did you hear that? Did you hear that? Who is this? Who is this? Can you say that? -Daddy. What did you say? Papa. You are so brave. -Very good. Poor boy. That is absolutely terrible. Poor parents. Would Ida know him? Would Ida have met him? -No, it is not. She is nine. He was... Yes, he was older. 14, isn't far. Very cruel. Aisha? -Ja? I want you to stay home today. -Why? Because I say so. Will you stay on the playground today? -Yes. Have you ever been to the pedestrian bridge? No, I haven't. -Bye. What is it? Everything fine? I can convince people. What do you mean? I can make people do things. Like what? -Things I want them to do. No way. I can do that. -Then do it on me. No. Yes. Come on. Or are you kidding? -Okay. Do not look. Why not? And promise not to laugh. How did you do that? -I do not know. That was a snake. What? Wasn't that you? No, that must have been you. I wanted to put you on the fridge. Are you afraid of snakes? -Yes very much. Keep upright. Like this? - A little further from your face. You would much rather be that way. Look at that one. If you look like this, what are you? Pleased. -Yeah, then you're happy. Then you laugh and clap your hands. You can laugh with your teeth or something. There are those who do. Just smile. They run so fast. What are you going to do? Just wait. Aisha? Stop. What are you going to do? Mind your own business. Oh my God. You shouldn't just leave. Where were you? Outside. -Outside? Crazy kid, you can't go outside. You can't go out alone. Good that you found her. What is it? We have to stop him. He wants to get us. He wants to harm us. He does that through others. But do you... What are you going to do? You are not allowed to participate. We can handle that. Together. That boy who's dead that was because of Ben. But you know that. Mom, can I take Anna with me? What? No. I'll be careful. Promised. It is too late. I thought you could tell the clock. Just a moment. -I said no. It is important. -I can come tomorrow. Then we can play. But now we're going to dinner. Mom? -Yes? Can I sleep with you tonight? Are you afraid? -Yes. Okay, come on. Sleep well. -Good night. Mom? -Yes? Do you have to work tonight? -No, not tonight. When do you go to bed? -I'll be right there. Now you must sleep. Okay? Mama? Mama? Yes? -Want to get Boffa? - Where is it? - I don't know. Okay, I'll see if I can find him. Anna? Mama? Mama? Anna? Do not act like that. Stop it, mom. Mom? -Yes. It'll be fine... I'm calling for my daughter. She's bleeding a lot. That's Odvar Solberg's Square 85. Yeah, okay. Can I have a bandage? -Yes, you'll get a bandage. Aisha, they are coming soon, please. Aisha, you have to stay awake. Wake up. You knew her a little bit, didn't you? Yes. Phew, that was terrible. But you or mom would never do such a thing, would you? No. Ida, girl, of course not. You shouldn't think that. Of course we would never harm you. Her mom was sick. Sick in her head. She was alone, very different from us. We would never harm you. You know that, right? -Yes. come on. Anna, are you coming? What... Let's go. Please. I can not do anything. Wake up. He's going to get us. Please. Sorry. Good night. Mom? -Yes? What do you do when someone is bad? Is someone being mean to you? No, it is not. But what if someone is bad? Or going to do something bad? Then you should tell an adult. And what if you are an adult? Then you may have to arrange that yourself. Or tell the police if it's really bad. Is there really no one mean to you? No, it is not. Sleep well then. -Sleep well. I'm going outside for a while. Mom? -Yes? Is everything alright? See you later. See you later... Who is there? -It's Ida. Wait, I'm coming down. Shall we go do something? Where is your sister? She's home. She's not doing so well. What have you got there? come. -Where are we going? It should be a little high. Do you want to throw? -Okay. It'll break right away. Here. It's better here. Shit, it's going to hit a car. Ready? -Yes. Hey, get off of there. Get off of there. Hey, stop. Hey you. Come back. Hey, it's mom. You are in the hospital. Say, baby... are you okay? And. You have a concussion. So if you're feeling confused, that's normal. How's the other one? He's fine. He got up and ran away. Is that a friend of yours? Who is he? I don't know. That's strange, because a witness claimed... that you pushed him on purpose. What actually happened? We were just playing. It'll be fine. Like this. Just give it to me. Is everything alright? -Yes. People are coming back from vacation. What was that? Nothing. I forgot to buy something. Can you babysit Anna? Yes that's OK. -See you soon. Hello, girls. There's an ambulance downstairs. You can see him from the balcony. Did it go well? What happened to your cast? Oh baby. Mama... Calm down. But baby anyway.
