- This is a new experience for me. - You're kidding. No, I mean, meeting a pretty girl like you on the road. Things like this never really happen. I almost don't know what to say. - Fake It. - Fake it? I suppose you're heading someplace? That's good for a start. No, I'm just out for a lovely ride. Look, I don't mean to be nosey or interfere… but you're not running away or something, are you? What if I am? - Well, are you old enough to run away? - What if I'm not? Hey, look. Whatever you're doing is your own business. I just happen to be a guy that likes a little conversation. You're kidding. How are we gonna do this? Simple. I'm leaving my clothes on. - But there's only one bed. - Big deal. Just throw me a pillow and don't worry about it. Will you mind if I get undressed? Look, I don't mind if you slit your throat. - Are you through yet? - Pretty soon. - Why are you running away? - I don't know. If I did, I wouldn't tell you. You're not exactly the kind of a guy a girl wants to pour her heart out to. Besides that, you don't care. You're trying to think of a way to get me in bed… and it's not gonna happen, so just go to sleep. I don't know why I got myself involved. I do, and I told you it's not gonna happen. Don't worry, I won't get you into any trouble. Hey, mister. How can you go to sleep so fast? Don't you know there's a world out there? People are dying, girls are getting raped… kids are in the backs of cars, making it. How would you know? You're just a dumb slob… a married slob. Hey, you wanna do a thing, honey? You gotta have a thing to do a thing, creep. What do you want? Could you kindly direct me to the ladies' restroom? May I help you, sir? My dad owns this station, and I help him out. - Yeah. Fill it up. - Okay. - Will you check under the hood? - Okay. - Will you pull your latch? - It's under the front bumper. I found it. - It's about a quart low. - Okay. Put it in. That'll be $5 even, sir. Well, Chas, now that you're a financial success... have you decided where you're gonna dine tonight? Not exactly. But I suppose the usual upper-class restaurant. But one never knows these days. Even in the finer restaurants... the service is so poor that one finds it quite difficult to enjoy one's dinner. But I suppose we must all make sacrifices, times being what they are. Can I give you a lift somewhere? - I don't know. Where are you going? - No place. Home. I mean, I was just going home. But if you need a ride… I don't know you. Why, I don't know you either. Is there someplace around here to get a cup of coffee? Yeah. Two blocks down the street. Wanna go there? - Two blocks down this street? - Yeah. I'll meet you there. That's silly. - I mean, it's just as simple to ride... - Let's do it my way. We'll do it your way some other time. All right. Two-and-a-half blocks, straight down this street. Don't worry. I'll be there. Okay, Chastity, now what are you gonna do? I don't know. He's not exactly my idea of Prince Charming. But then who is? I hope he isn't the octopus type. They're the worst. Next to the bulldog type. Of course, they're the worst. Maybe he'll be a lamb, though. I could tell he wasn't a peacock. I guess it really doesn't matter. I mean they all want the same thing. They all want the same stupid thing. They want to pant, and grunt, and groan, and then roll over like a dead body. Chastity, you're not being very nice. You've got to be civil in this uncivilized world. What difference does it make what type he is? They're all the same. They're all men. What difference does it make? Well? Would you like something to eat? You gonna eat? Yeah. I could eat. What's good here? Not much. Steak and eggs is safe. Steak and eggs, then. - Two steak and eggs. - Two steak and eggs. - Can you make mine well-done? - Well-done. The same. Well… You know, this is always the worst part. This part's such a drag. The "Hello, how are you? What's your name?" ceremony. You put on a big front, I put on a big front. Then we talk for about half an hour, trying to figure out what we both like. Then we figure out what we both like. Then we talk about what we both like… until we can't figure out anything else to say about what we both like. Well, my name's Chastity. That's not really my name. Well, I guess that's my name now. But It's not the name they gave me when I was born. I decided it wasn't fair. Why should people be stuck with a name that they didn't even get to choose? Well, suppose my name was Emily, wouldn't that be awful? So one day, I started looking through the dictionary… when I came to the "C's," I saw Chastity. And it said, "Chastity: "Abstinence… "sexual purity… "freedom from ornamentation, simplicity." I liked all that, except for "abstinence" because I didn't know what it meant. So I went back to the "A's," and it said, "Abstinence: Non-indulgence… "and voluntary restraint of desires." And I liked that. - What's your name, anyway? - Eddie. I guess you could be an Eddie. If I have the time, I'll think of a better name for you. Aren't you a little bit old to be parking cars? I don't mean you're old… I just mean you don't look like the car-parking type. That's not all I do. What else do you do? I go to school. - I'm studying law. - You're going to be a lawyer? I hope so. That's why I'm going to school. What are you gonna be? Why do people have to be something? I don't want to be anything right now. I just wanna be myself. Can I sleep with you tonight? Hey, wait a minute. I didn't mean what you're thinking. I meant, can I sleep where you live? Look, I've got $4.27, and I haven't got any place to stay. Can I sleep at your house? A little while ago, you wouldn't ride two blocks in my car with me. Well, I didn't know you then. - Do you know me now? - Enough. Do me a favor though, okay? Don't try and make me. I'll tell you if I feel like it. You're not a girl. You're a whole other thing. Thank you. - For what? - I liked what you just said. This is it. Home. What do you want me to say? "It's nice"? I guess it's nice. I mean, it works, doesn't it? Everything in your house works. The lights work. And this light works. And that light works. Drawers work. The sock drawer works, and the underwear drawer works. That light works. And the bathroom. Does the bathroom work? Yeah. The faucets work, and the bathtub works. And the old toilet works. Let's go in the kitchen. Light works. And the refrigerator works. Stove works. Burner works. And the sink works. And the salt and pepper work. Your house works! - Did you have fun? - Yeah. If you don't mind, I'm tired. Now, if you've got a pillow and a blanket, I'll be cool. I wonder how many bedrooms this makes? Thirty or forty. I guess I'm losing count. Well, he's not really that bad. I mean, after all he let me sleep in his bedroom by myself. But I wonder about all that stuff that he talks about, about God and all that. It's really weird to find a young guy that believes in that jazz. I guess God can't hurt you. I just thought people made up God... so they'd have something bigger than them to believe in. I don't dig the way people use God. I mean, like on Sunday it's like: Rent-a-God. Everybody goes to church and then you're clean... and then you go home and you're just as bad as you were Saturday. I don't know why you have to go to church... I mean, why couldn't you go to the First National Bank and pray. I mean, I'm sure he's there. I'm sure he's everywhere. Well, I'm not sure he's everywhere, but I think he is. I guess God isn't so bad... but if all the people that talked about God... acted more the way he said you should act... church wouldn't be such a drag I guess. I don't know, it all seems silly to me... I don't want to think about it. He really believes that religion stuff. That figures. You're so beautiful. I love you. Don't wait dinner for me tonight, darling, I'll be late. And tell the butler to send the cleaning out… and call my furrier and tell him that I've just got to have that coat by Friday. Goodbye, darling. I'll be right back. I'm just going to get some groceries. I've never been in a church like this before. It's really great. I thought you were supposed to do that on Sunday. I've just confessed, and I'm doing penance. And we're not to talk in here. I see. Confessed to what? I've just confessed my sins. I see. Well, why'd you have to cop out? Yes? Hey, you wanna do a thing, honey? Yes? I just remembered I left something on the stove. Operator. Operator, would you give me the Phoenix Police Department, please? That will be 50 cents for the first three minutes, please. Phoenix Police Department. Hello. - I'm a citizen. - You're a what? I said I'm a citizen. Yes. I'm a citizen that helps the police… and I've found you a stolen car. A stolen car? Fine. What's the license number? The license number? Just a second. Hello? Excuse me. HZC-542. Excuse me. Hello, The number is… HZC-542. Yeah, and it's parked on the main street… in Frontera. - Frontera? - Yeah. HZC-542. Miss, what's the make of the car? How do you know it's stolen? - You're welcome. - Did you steal the car? Hey, mister, you wanna screw my sister? - What'd she say? - I don't know. I didn't get it. Well, Chastity… here you are in beautiful Mexico. Land of potted palm, sunshine… bullfights… Spanish fly, and pot. Speaking of pot… I ought to be able to get along just fine. I got $1 for a couple of joints, $1 for some frijoles… and I still got money to burn. - Hi. - Hello. How much do they cost? Twenty-five cents, señorita. Okay, give me two. - Dos? - Yeah. Can you make them to go? - For what? - Never mind. Just give me two. Oh, it's nothing. Well, Chastity, my girl, let's go see what it's all about. Come on, you can do better than that. - Come on, let's get out of here. - Yeah, bye. We'll think it over. No thanks. Hey, you wanna sell me some of that stuff? Okay. What else do you sell, Don Juan? I'll bet you're just full of little goodies, aren't you? I have some pictures. You wanna buy some pictures? Of course. Yeah. Let's see them. These are fabulous. Did you or a professional photographer take these? No, I don't take them. I just sell them. How much do you sell them for? $5. You want to buy them? - Do a lot of people buy these things? - Sure. I sell many of them. Look at that one. It's got the whole family, even the little dog. Yeah, the bow-wow. You want to buy them. I'll sell to you for $3. Just $3 for me? Why, am I something special? For you I make a special price. $3. You want to buy them? No, thanks. - Why, you don't like them? - Oh, no. I think they're wonderful. It's just that I don't have a wallet to put them in. If you've got a wallet you can put them in the little plastic windows. If you're out at a social event or to a dinner with an old friend… you can say, "Hey, have I shown you the pictures of my family lately?" And then you just whip out your wallet. Serious. What am I gonna do with them? - I bet you think they're evil. - I don't even know what evil is… but if I did, I'm sure it wouldn't be those stupid pictures. Now, if you want to be nice, we can make some money together. - How we can make money together? - You're a pimp, right? Yeah. I mean, you get girls for guys? - Do you work for somebody? - Sure. If you told them you had a good-looking girl that wanted to go to work… you'd stand to make some money, right? You mean to tell me you want to go to work as a whore? Sure, I love it here. I mean, the weather is beautiful. It's a place I could really call home. And on the weekends, I could go fishing. No, I guess the weekends are our most important days. I'll probably get Monday and Tuesday off. - We have to get in my car and go for a ride. - Okay. - Hey, by the way, what's your name? - Chastity. You stay right here a minute, please. You wait. Here you are in a real Mexican cathouse. What are you so nervous about? You're the girl that wanted to see everything. Take a good look. Are they any worse than me, or am I worse than them? Who's the phony, them or me? You said you wanted to play games, sweetheart, play them. Come on, handsome. Nope, that's no good. That's no good either. Here we are. Come on in. Okay. Now, what was it you wanted? Look, you're here now. What do you want? You can have one girl, or two girls, or three, or even more. But, if I were you, I'd stick with one. You can have just as much fun with one girl. Okay? It'll cost you $25. Well, you see, I'm the youngest and the prettiest so I cost more. Okay. For you, $15. Thank you. Now, do you want the special or the quickie? Take the special, the quickie's a drag. Fine, that'll be another $10. Thank you. One more thing. The special's not bad, but the whole works… The whole works is where it's really at. You want the whole works? Good. That'll be another $15. Thank you very much. Now take your clothes off. Well, we certainly can't do anything with your clothes on. That's right. Take them off. Take them all off. By the way, what's your name anyway? Nope, you're a Tom. A definite Tom. Tom what? Well, I guess it doesn't make any difference. How old are you Tommy, my boy? Hey, wait a minute. Let's not rush things. You said you wanted the whole works. You see, when you get me, I mean, you're not just getting anything. I bet when you came here today, you didn't expect to get anything like me, did you? Well, Tommy, my boy, today is your lucky day. I suppose you want to get started. Here, stick your head in this basin. Well, you don't want me to make love to a dirty man, do you? You see, this is one of the features that you get when you get the whole works. - It's cold. - I'm sorry. You see, we haven't got any hot water, something to do with the pipes. Never mind, as soon as we get you dried off, you'll be as good as new. There now, stand up and let's have a look at you. Oh, that's fine. That's just beautiful. No. Now, you stay here, and I'll go get some clean towels… and I'll come back and I'll give you a good rinse… and you'll be as good as new. Don't go away. Where have you been? I've been looking for you. Come with me upstairs, ándele. Come in. Won't you be seated? This is the girl I was telling you about. What is your name? - Look, when she asks you a question... - Don't touch her. - But I was only trying to... - Get out. Did you have fun with the boy scout? - How old are you? - I'm old enough. - I understand you want to go to work here. - Yeah? Well, you understand wrong. If I'm gonna be a whore, I'm not gonna work in a dump like this. I'll work by myself. I bet you would. What do you want, Chastity? What do you mean, what do I want? If you mean what am I doing here, I just came here to find out a few things. - Did you find them? - Yeah. Would you like to see more? Yeah, that's what I'm here for. All right. We'll do it the easy way this time. You've already seen this room. The pleasure room. They see whatever they want to see. As far as they're concerned, this room is a golden mansion. I thought you wanted to see everything. The exhibition room. Pretty? Come on further down the hall. Wait here one minute. - I just thought I'd throw that in. - You didn't have to. Are you having a daydream, Chastity? You're thinking, aren't you? People always think. I even think. Once I tried not to, but I couldn't help it. Thoughts kept popping in my head. Sometimes I don't like to think, though. Do you? - Do I what? - Not like to think. Well, that depends on what I'm thinking about. Right now, I'm thinking about you. I like that. I guess I should be thinking about you, but I'm not. - Does that make you feel bad? - No. It shouldn't really. I never think about anything good. I mean, I usually think about stupid things like… if flowers cry when you pick them. Or how come people don't buy newspapers from the newspaper boy. Sometimes I even think about my toes. You think that's silly? Why is this bedroom different, Chastity? Why aren't you waiting for morning so you can hurry up and get out of here? Why do you feel so peaceful? What happened to the world outside? What makes it different this time? Is it her? She's weird, too weird. Why isn't she bugging me then? Be careful, Chas, this is a new scene. You always get mad when people do that. Why aren't you getting mad now? You hate to be touched. Isn't that funny? This time it doesn't bother you. She touches me like my mother did. My mother, that's a joke. There I go again. Now I'm feeling sorry for myself. Well, Chas, you made the gamut. Here you are, rubbing noses with a dyke. I wonder why dykes are dykes. Maybe they really want to be moms or something like that. That's stupid. They just like girls. Ask a stupid question and you'll get a stupid answer. Who are you mad at, me or yourself? Come and eat your dinner, Chastity. Your food is going to get cold. You stink! And this place stinks! And you can't do anything to me! Eddie, open up! - Can I come in? - I didn't think I'd ever see you again. - Well, I can go. - No. I mean, no. I just ran out to get some groceries. - You've got $25 worth of groceries there. - No. $40. I mean, the cost of living just keeps rising and rising. Where did you get all that money? That reminds me, I borrowed a dollar from you. Somebody die and leave you a fortune? What? Oh, you mean the money. Well, it's what you might call government money. That's the best kind. I never use the privately printed stuff. Would you mind opening the door? I turn my back and you sneak food into the house. You. I've got good news for you. I've decided what your new name should be. Oh, you have? It's nice to know you've been thinking about me. Especially the way you left the other day. I've even got a last name. I'm really fortunate. What is it? - Have you got any champagne? - No. - Any beer? - No. - Orange juice? - No orange juice over the head at 3:00 a.m. Okay, but it won't be as official. What's my new name? I want you to know that I gave it a lot of thought. I mean, I just didn't pull it out of the thin air. That makes me feel very good. Do you think you're going to get around to telling me what it is? - Kneel down. - Kneel down? Wait a minute. I christen you Andre Tayir. Do you think we can get some sleep now? You men are all alike. All right go to sleep if it's so important to you. Don't misunderstand me. All right, if you don't want to talk, then let's go to bed. Okay, I'll get a blanket and a pillow and make up the couch. You sleep in your own bed. No, really, I don't mind sleeping on the couch. Come on, Andre, let's go to bed. Have you got any clean sheets? It looks like a hussy has been sleeping here. - What if a hussy had been sleeping here? - Then I would have shot you. First I would have shot her, then I would have shot you. In the leg. - Just in the leg? - No, then in the other leg. - Would you be through then? - No. Then I'd shoot you in both your arms, and break a bottle over your head. What do you think about that? - I think I'm glad you're not my wife. - Yeah, well, I ought to do it anyway. I don't get it. I mean, you pop in and out of my life like a jack-in-the-box. What do you want, Chastity? I wish I had a dollar for every time somebody asked me that question. I know I don't want that anymore. I thought you wanted to get some sleep. - Well, yeah, I had, but… - I'll turn around and you get into bed. I wish I had a dollar for every time I had to do this, too. What? Turn around while somebody got undressed. If I got pregnant, would you marry me? Wait, don't answer that. - You can answer me now. - How can I answer a question like that? - You just did. - That isn't even a fair question. Fair, shmair. You answered my question. Why did you ask me that? I mean, I feel like I said the wrong thing. I like you a lot. You know, I feel like I've known you for a long time. Boy, for someone who wanted to get some sleep… - you sure aren't getting any. - I don't mind. - I thought you weren't going to undress. - So did I. Don't try and do anything to me. Just cuddle me. Hold me tight. We'll pretend there's no world outside this room. Let's pretend that you and I are the only two people that exist. Are you going to be here when I wake up in the morning? Yeah, I'll be here. I would marry you if you were pregnant. I'm smiling. So am I. - Well, isn't this a pleasant surprise? - I'm playing wife today. Well, what do you want? It's my first day. Do you have to go away today? Yeah, I should go to a class. I don't have to, though. I can stay with you if you want me to. No. If you're going to be a lawyer, you've got to go to school. What time do you have to go? Pretty soon. I'm late, it's an early class. What are you smiling for? I'm not gonna be gone very long. I only have one class. Then I'll make dinner for you when you get home. That should be a real inspiration. Be smart or whatever it is you have to be when you go to college. About dinner…let's eat out tonight. Look, she needs a man. A grown man around. She doesn't have one. You're never home. What the hell are you doing all the time? Big deal. Didn't you tell me to take her out, take her to the park once in a while. Yes, but not that way. What way? I'm saying if she was an ugly pig you wouldn't have a word to say about it. It wouldn't matter if I brushed the hair... Yeah, I would. I'd have a lot to say about it, as a matter of fact. Oh, stop it, please. ...I pushed the hair out of her eyes last night. Oh, I wish you'd shut up. I'm sorry. ...twisted. You're a goddamn jealous whore. Please be quiet. ...by a dirty old man. What's molested? You're lucky that she's as pretty as she is. Would you like to have an ugly.... I do not want that kid molested by a dirty old man. What's molested? You're lucky that she's as pretty as she is. Would you like to have an ugly.... I can't stand it. Please stop it. Please stop that. This is the last time I'll offer to take her for a drive in the park. Go on take her away. Please, stop. What are you laughing about? I'm sorry. If she doesn't know, you're the one to teach her about that. I'm really sorry. The things I gotta do for Emily for Christ's sake. You forgot that you're having to pay for it. Please, stop it. Child molester! Can I give you a lift, baby? I love you. Oh, Mother.
