[dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] [vehicle approaching] Thank you, Debbie. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Wait a second! Wait! [door thuds] [door thuds] Won't you invite me for coffee? Debbie... I'm sure Irene is waiting for us. So what? You can make an excuse of why we're together. I'll see you at the office, okay? Please? My throat is so dry. Or maybe you don't want to make coffee for me? While I spent four liters of gasoline. In my office tomorrow. I'll even give you five gallons of coffee, okay? All I want is a cup of coffee. Now. [metal gate cranks] [metal gate squeaks] [door thuds] - Oh, you! - Quiet! Okay, okay! I promise. Irene. It's already late. You're still up? Oh. My secretary, Debbie. - You know my wife, Irene. - Hi, good evening. Good morning. Oh, is it? I'm sorry, I didn't realize that it's two in the morning. Sir, just bring the papers in office tomorrow. No! It's just in my room. I'll find it, okay? I'll accompany you, sir. I know the folders better than you. Come inside. [door thuds] Is it okay, ma'am? Oh, hon. Can you make her coffee? Please. Okay? [door thuds] Debbie, my son might wake up. He's in deep sleep. Please, Debbie! Irene might suspect us. But you asked her to make coffee. She might see us. Debbie, she'll suspect us, okay? Fine, let's close the door. [door thuds] [intimate music playing] [laughs] [intimate music playing] [suspenseful music playing] [suspenseful music playing] It's not what you think it is. I tripped so she fell on top of me. I'll just see you in the office, boss. We can't find the papers here. Excuse me, ma'am. I have to go. You stupid whore! If you'll do immoral acts, don't do it here in my house. Not in my room and not even on my bed! Let me go! Your should be rebuking your husband! There's no fuel yet he's in flame! - How dare you! Get out! - Ouch! [door slammed] You have no manners! You are immoral! If Jopet woke up, he could have seen your show! We were looking for the papers. I tripped so I accidentally pulled Debbie. Oh, really? That's why your top is unbuttoned? It's really hot. That's why the door was locked? No one locks themselves, if they aren't doing something bad! Screw you! I hear nothing from you but pure suspicions! Screw you too! Do not try to draw pretty things on the ugly scene that I've witnessed! Your eyes are clear yet you blur it with jealousy! Hey, I want to sleep, okay? Shut your mouth or else, I'll punch you! Oh, really? [metal clanks] You will leave this house, or I will stab you? Or maybe you want to sleep, so when you wake up, you'll have your penis cut! What? Get out! [door thuds open] Get out of here! What? I said, get out! [door thuds close] [dramatic music playing] [sobs] [pounds wall] [sobs] [dramatic music playing] [car approaching] [door thuds] - Hop in! - I thought you already left? You always know I'm a good friend. I was sure this will be your ending. Would I let you ride a cab? Come on! [door thuds] [engine revving] [dramatic music playing] [door thuds] Jopet. Jopet. Jopet. Wake up, my son. We will leave. - Jopet. - Ma'am. Ma'am, what's going on? Pacing. Please pack Jopet's clothes, and some of his toys. Pack our clothes as well. Go on. - Jopet. - Where are we going? - The house is not even burning. - Stop asking questions. Just do what I asked you to do. Go now. [door thuds] [dramatic music playing] [switch clicks] [glass clinks] Here you go. Here. Let's celebrate. Now, we're totally free. Help them out with their things. Bring them up to the guest room. Change the bedding. Coffee? Beer? Something hard? What did your jerk husband do this time? [sobs] [continue sobbing] It hurts. It's painful. It's partly your fault. If you weren't such a fool. Haven't I told you? Just give birth to your child without getting married. When you're finally on good terms, then get married! What now? [sobs] Sorry. [sobs] Chay, we'll stay until tomorrow only. I just don't want to disturb mom this late. It's okay. Stay as long as you want. What's the rush? Don't tell me, you also believed - that we'll have to finish papers? - Debbie... Debbie, it's ten o'clock, okay? I need to go somewhere important. Don't tell me, you'll go back to her? Talk to your daughter, Celia. Talk to your daughter! Why me? You're the father! Face her yourself. I might not be able to control myself. - Angelica. - Mom? Accompany the nanny of Jopet to his room so the child can rest. Jopet, let's go. No! I don't want to! I want to be with my mommy. Go ahead, son. Go to your room, okay? - Come on. - You go to your room. Have pity on your son. That little hardship should be endured for the child's sake. It's because of you. It's your fault. You're young, yet you went ahead and got married. You already tied the knot. Now who lost? I pity your son. He'll grow fatherless. So... Do you understand now? Irene is also your daughter. Her problem is your problem, too. When we're telling you off, you don't listen. What now? When the storms comes, who do you run to? [engine revving] [door thuds] [door thuds] [door thuds] [soft music playing] [soft music playing] [soft music playing] [soft music playing] [soft music playing] [dramatic music playing] Did she bring the child with her? Yes, she did. That girl! She can't even support her child! Very intrusive! Have you called in her mother's house? No, not yet mom. Where else could she be? Patrick. Get the child. I'm sure Irene won't give me my son. If she wants to leave, it's fine! But she shouldn't bring my grandchild with her. Please? She won't let that happen. That girl is stubborn! You see what I mean? Right from the start, I told you! What? Did you listen? Did you? Oh, of course not! You were too busy trying to prove you're a man. You threw away your career. You wasted the best years of your life. For what? All for that woman! Do you believe me now? Will you stop nagging me? My ears are already hurt because of Irene's mouth! Just get your son! Don't you even fetch that girl! It will just get into her head. She'll use my grandchild to blackmail you. Stop! Get Jopet! I'll get my son but don't tell me what to do! Jopet? Eat your vegetables, or else you won't grow up. - [phone ringing] - Very good! I'll answer it. Eat some more. Oh. Please wait. Why did you call just now? Irene. It's Patrick. He wants to talk to you. What for, mom? Mommy? Why? Don't you want to talk to daddy? Jopet, just eat your food. Call later instead, Patrick. Damn it! I just lost my appetite. What were you thinking, Irene? The man's trying to be humble. Yet you won't forgive him. Every time you'll have a fight, you should not just pack and run. Mom, I left for my son's sake. I don't want him to see us arguing. I don't want him to know what his father does. Marriages are built on sacrifices. Daddy, sacrificing is different from getting fooled. I ran out of patience. I don't want to be insulted. You talk to your daughter. Jopet. Aren't you sleepy yet, my son? When are we going home, mommy? We'll stay here for a while. How about daddy? How will he bring me gifts? I'm still here for you. Besides, mommy loves you so much. Mommy, will I still pray for daddy? Of course, my son. No matter what happens to us, he is still your dad. Okay, go to sleep. Okay, pray first before you sleep. In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit. Amen. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. - Good night, mommy. - I love you. Good night. [soft music playing] You really did it? You didn't talk to him? No. Good for you. I've become numb for his apologies. I know the feeling. The last time my boyfriend said sorry, I wanted to punch him. What did your mom say? Did she scold you? Yeah, she said, "what will happen to you and Jopet?" With regards to dad, I feel like he's counting what my son and I eat. What's your plan? I don't know, Betchay. I feel like... like I'm drained and tired. I feel used and abused. Silly. How old are you now anyways? It's not the numbers, it's the feeling. Why did he replace me? Was it because I look older now after I gave birth? Stop overthinking. You're being too dramatic. It's not you who has a problem, it's Patrick. It's because he's stupid. All he has is what's inside his zipper. What's lacking in me? You don't lack anything. It's just that, your husband is a mama's boy. Every now and then, he has to prove his masculinity. We heard you have a mistress. Dad, she's just a friend. Irene is just jealous of everybody. Will she get jealous without a reason? She has been brainwashed by Betchay. Who is that, Celie? Irene's friend. You already know her. She went here before. She brainwashed Irene's head so she became toxic. Okay, okay. You both need to talk. Fix this mess. What you're doing is not funny at all. Go back home! Why? Do you think I left you for you to have fun? There's already someone who does that for you. I don't have any mistress. You are really an expert at lying. Can that be learned through practice? Or is it just your second nature to fool girls? Do you think I'll play with every girl I meet? Oh, no. Not all of them. Some of them are those you can just fool. Or women who know you're married but want to prove their sex appeal and your knees' weakness. Can you please stop it? Patrick, I'm not stupid. I'm your wife. After a while. Even if nobody tells me, it's my instinct that works. I sacrificed everything for Jopet. But when you and your secretary fooled around, - on my bed-- - Come on! You should consult a doctor for your insecurities! I'm not insecure! You are! Because you want to prove to everybody that you can sleep with any girl you want. Patrick, I'm not a saint to serve you at home. Or to bear your child, while you serve other women. Are you done? I have one question. - Can you tell me the truth? - What? If you didn't get me pregnant, would you still marry me? Thank you. You answered my question. [water splashing] [water bubbling] Debbie? Hi, Patrick! Have you eaten? There's food on the table. - I've eaten. - Join me then! Take a dip. - Okay, I'll join you in a minute. - Okay. - Hurry up! - Okay. [water bubbling] [water splashes] [running water] - Hi. - Hi. [intimate music playing] Is there a need for diploma to be a secretary? I am computer-literate. My English is not that bad. True. I know someone who graduated Communications in St. Scholastica. What's her work now? There, traffic aide here at Legaspi Village. It's true, it happens. [sighs] What if I put up a business? What type of business? I don't know. Baby clothes? Do you know anything about that kind of business? That can be learned, right? Yes. If you get bankrupt, you'll definitely learn. What should I do? I can't even get a job. Wait, Irene. Are you sure that you can do this on your own? It's so easy to reconcile with Patrick. One sorry, one kiss. Solved. I can do this, whatever it takes. After what he had done, I'll die of hunger but I'll never reconcile with him. Are you out of your mind? [door thuds] Damn it! This Jopet is so naughty! And this nanny is so stupid! She's not paying attention to her surroundings! And you have a lot of things in mind. Mom, this can be fixed. How can that be fixed? That vase is older than me. Whatever. Are we still obliged to support our daughter's family until now? And your mistake. Should we bear the consequences? [door thuds] Irene! My child! [sobbing] What happened? Oh, ma'am, the kid accidentally bumped the old vase. Mommy! I told you to be careful. It was just an accident. Irene, don't scold the kid. I will replace that, mom. But, there are things that when broken, it cannot be fixed even if you want to. I'm sorry, Irene, Jopet. I'm always ill-tempered because... it hurts me to see your situation. I know that, mom. [dramatic music playing] Hi! I've been waiting for you. Oops, just stay there. Catch! - What's this? - What do you think? Keys for what? For the house. Why? Why do you need to go to the townhouse if you're alone? Besides, we've already proven that even if there are two of us, it's not crowded, right? Do you know what you're suggesting? Why? Do you need to ask permission from your mom? What is the catch? What catch? None! I won't ask you to pay the bills. What if Irene uses this relationship so I won't get the custody of my child? So you should act fast. Before Jopet forgets that he has a father. Or worse, by the time you get your child, that key is already rusting. Six thousand a month for just a studio type? This is a condominium. There are guards and elevator. If lower than that, it's just an apartment or mezzanine. What do you think are the rates now? Anyway, thank you. I'll think about it depending on my budget. Miss beautiful! Have a drink. She snubbed you! [laughs] [door thuds] [door creaks] [door thuds] The last one who lived here was disgusting. But when you get it cleaned, this will look good. What is your name again? It's Irene. It's well ventilated. Most importantly, the water supply is good. A little bit of cleaning, and some decorations, this will be okay. - How much is the rent? - 1500 pesos. Two months deposit, one month advance. You'll be on your own? You and your son? As far as Sampaloc? What if something happens to you? Dad, the door has a padlock. - Mom. - How about when you go out on streets? You were able to pay the rent and deposit for the house. But after that, what? Where will you get money? And, do you know how much food costs nowadays? If you enter a supermarket with just a thousand in your pocket, you'll just bring home a small bag. - I know that, mom. - You know that? Why do you still insist what you want? Let's not argue anymore. I've already made up my mind. That's not only being stubborn. She's out of her mind, Celie. My child, how will you live? What about your job? How much salary will you ask for? And when you leave the house, Jopet will be left with her nanny. Celie. Talk some sense to your daughter! Sorry, miss. Being an undergraduate is not an issue. But what's important is the work experience. Anyway, if there's a job opening in the future, we'll let you know. Thank you. Okay. Patrick, as far as I know, people who swim gets wet. You're thinking about her again, right? I just want to see my son. Patrick, save yourself some dignity and pride. Just mind your own business. Look at yourself. She's the one who left! Look, Patrick. You just have to accept the fact that it's over. The end. Finished. Don't open what's already closed. You don't know because you don't have a child. Patrick. Don't use the child as an excuse. Accept that your ego was hurt. You can't accept that Irene doesn't want you anymore. Can you just stop? Don't annoy me. You even look happy by the way you talk. Because things are clear for you now. There's no need to hide. You're free now, right? I'm not a villain anymore. Yes. You're great, you're just talkative. [scoffs] I just know what I want. I fight for it. I don't base it on luck. I get it. [soft music playing] [people arguing] [dog barking] [people clamoring] [soft music playing] [people arguing] [dog barking] [lighter clicks] What's on your mind? Nothing. You're thinking about her again. Who? Who else? I just hope that sometimes, you'll make me feel that I'm the only one. What's your problem? Nothing. Even if you are with me, you're still thinking of her. I feel disrespected. What else do you want me to do? I'm here and stuck with you. You're here but your mind is not. You're confusing. So I'm the one confusing? Didn't you say before to have no expectations? I'm not asking for too much! I hope that somehow, you respect me. My whole being. I'm not a piece of bone, that you can eat whenever you run out of food. What do you want from me? To be tied to your bed? Chain me on your waist, is that it? Why? Am I choking you? Oh, no! You're too lax on me. I don't get you! Then, I don't care if you don't get it! Fine, I'm confusing. Oh. You only finished your first year in college. And you don't have any working experience. I thought Peachy already told you everything about me. [scoffs] She told me a lot about you, but she didn't mention that you're an undergraduate. Miss Cordero. I really need this job. Please? Oh, Mrs. Alvarado. Don't cry. My God. My mascara isn't waterproof. Do I get the job? Huh? Whatever. I don't know. Oh! This Peachy. She's taking advantage of us being sorority sisters. Even in recommending! But- Thank you so much, Ms. Cordero! Thank you so much! You know what? When I entered earlier, I thought you were so nice! Thank you so much! I will not forget this! - Thank you! - Okay, okay. Oh, yes! That girl is beautiful! Yes. - Where is she from? - Dude. Can I ask something? Where does Vergie Santillan live? Hmm. It's two doors away. You see that coconut tree? There it is. Thanks, dude. Take a seat. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] Miss, what's your name? That's English, dude. [ominous music playing] - Hey! - What the! She doesn't understand your English! She's snobbish. Get out of my way. What's the problem? It's nothing, dude. We're just talking to her. Brother. Since we'll be neighbors soon, let me have this. There's no problem with that, dude. Go now, miss. Thank you. I'll go now, dude. I owe you one. Yes. Pacing. Here is your salary. Thank you. [sobs] [soft music playing] Be good, okay? Where's your masculinity? Are you content? That she'll have your child alone? Is that it? What do you want me to do? Get a knife and cut my son in half? Oh, dear. Look. Look how your mind works. What I mean is, you can fight for visitation rights. Now, there will be days that the child can stay with you. If you don't have time, bring him here. You know, sweetheart, mom has a point. After all, if we're going to marry, it's better if the child will be close to me. You know I can be a mother to him. You know, you girls, I don't understand how your minds work. I can't catch up with you. But don't forget that old cliché. Behind the success of a man is a woman. Mommy. Why can't I come with you? Children are not allowed there. Be good, okay? I'll buy you a gift. - Siopao, mommy? - Anything you want. - You want siopao? - Yes. Miss Vergie. Here's Jopet. I'll leave him to you. Kindly look after him, I have to go to work. He better not be naughty. No, he promised he'll behave. You're a good boy, right? Let's have an approval first. You know I'm a spinster and have no experience with kids. He is a very good boy. Oh. Can I borrow a towel? Irene, this is my nephew, Boni. He will also live here with me. He just arrived from the province. - We already met. - Where? Yesterday on the street. If those jerks try to mess with you again, let me know, okay? [giggles] Okay, Miss Vergie, I'll leave Jopet now. I have to go to work. It's my first day and I don't want to be late. Kiss. Leave it to me, I'll help my auntie. I'm used to kids because of my younger sibling. Thanks again. Okay son, I need to go. Oh, you promise to behave, okay? Be a good boy. Mommy, don't forget your promise, okay? Of course. Mommy, why do you have to leave? So that we can eat. I'll leave now. Thanks again. - Okay. - Bye. Aunt, how is Irene related to that kid? He's her son. Irene. This is going to be your desk. Mr. Sandejas will report at 10:30. But he expects you to start now. Oh, he already signed- Excuse me, Jocelyn. Take charge of orienting Irene about her job. If there's anything you need, just call her. Leo H. Urduva, I'm always at your service. Thank you. Well, if you have any further questions, just ask these two ladies. Okay? I am Maria Makiling. When it comes to boys, I favor no one. All of them are okay for me. [giggles] I am Maria Sinukuan, all boys gave up on sustaining my wants. I'm the most polite among the bachelor employees here. Oh, really? Well, I have a husband and a son. Really? Yes. Okay. - See you later. - Alright. Sir Red mostly comes to office in late afternoon. So get used in going home late. Late? Aren't we just until five o'clock here? Of course, can you leave if your boss is still here? Oh no, he won't let you go until you've finished all your tasks. Hi girls. - Hi. - For a while, I'll wash my hands. Excuse me. Cynthia? Are we going to have dinner? No way! Your girlfriend might spill acid on me. Oh, you have a new office mate. Why didn't you introduce me? Irene, this is Anton. Anton, this is Irene. Hi. My friends are always like this. If they're with someone beautiful, they will hide her so they will enjoy me. Alright, I might be disturbing your lunch. I'm not asking for free lunch. Bye. Why would we buy you lunch? You should be the one treating us. Okay, I will on payday. That's for sure. He never did that. Payday? Boastful yet stingy. [door thuds] [door thuds] Good afternoon, sir. You wanted to talk to me? I'm your new secretary, sir. Is there anything I can do for you? Yes. Oh. You're? Irene? Irene Alvarado? Yes, sir. You're married? Sir? Myrna told me you're married. Yes sir, I'm married. No, I was married. Yes, sir, I'm still married. Well, you certainly don't look like one. Have these xeroxed. Then, you ask Jocelyn to- You know Jocelyn, don't you? Yes sir, I do. You ask her to teach you how to operate the fax machine. You know about fax machine? Fax? Yes, sir. Good. Then, make a long distance call to Sydney. Get in touch with Mrs. Campbell. Tell Mrs. Campbell that documents will be ready by late next week. You're still with me? Irene Alvarado? My very much married secretary. [funny synth playing] Yes sir, I am. Good. [soft music playing] Oh. Sir? Are you sure you're married? Would you like me to bring my marriage certificate? They might think you're not. Okay, have that photocopied and I'll give you other things to do. - Yes, sir. - Irene. Sir? Coffee. Black, no cream, and half a teaspoon of sugar. Yes, sir. [soft music playing] [door thuds] [door thuds] [laughs] Really? You've seen planes before? Yes, there are different kinds in Angeles. There's a fighter and a bomber, too? Of course, there is. That's why a lot hate bases. Because they might be targeted by Russia once the war starts. Why would there be war? I'll tell you next time, you're still young. - Isn't fun to be a plane? - Yes! [laughs] [mimics plane] - Jopet! - Mommy! Hi! [soft music playing] Get on. There! [soft music playing] Careful, you might fall. [soft music playing] Mommy! What are you doing here? He cried earlier. He thought you won't go home. So I brought him here. Your auntie said you're here. It's embarrassing, we even disturbed you. Oh, it's fine. I had fun with your son. Mommy, I want to go to Angeles. They said there are planes there. Jopet wants to be a pilot, huh? But he wants to be a scientist before. I don't know with this kid. Every year, his ambition changes. [chuckles] Mommy, I am so hungry. Okay come, I will cook now. Why don't you invite your Uncle Boni since you made him tired? Uncle Boni, join us for dinner! Sure! Mom. I just thought of talking to you and dad because you've been together for a long time. - So you might give me an advice- - What is it again? Is it about Patrick? Or a different guy? Of course, I often feel sad. Because I'm used with having my husband with me. But when I remember what Patrick did, I suddenly feel sick to my stomach. Well, just pray some more. And If you can't take it anymore, talk to your husband. He might change. But Mom, my landlady has a nephew. He's really nice. He's like a father to Jopet. And you're falling for him. Hey, Irene. Don't be fooled. You'll end up being an adulterer. You'll burn in hell. How? I'll live my whole life without the right to love? Oh, Celia. Talk to your daughter! Irene. If you really think you cannot fix your marriage, tell us. Because you were only fifteen and Patrick was sixteen when married. What are you thinking of? Annulment? [scoffs] That's not freedom for you to remarry! Isn't that unfair? Why wouldn't they just approve divorce here in the Philippines? It's only one mistake, dad. Should I regret it forever? Then why you didn't think, before you jumped the gun! [engine revving] [door thuds] [engine revving] Oh, hi! Patrick asked me to get him some clothes. He doesn't have time. Do you have something to say? Tell him that I apologize for not asking him permission. I don't have budget to buy his son clothes so I got the old ones. Even if it's hard to fit, he can still use it. Is it hard for you to raise him alone? Or maybe you want me to tell Patrick to get your son? Hey! My son is not a shoe to borrow. And not a puppy to give away. I thought you told me earlier that Patrick should buy clothes for his son? If he has the initiative, he'll bring what Jopet needs. But if he'll get my son to show him his dirty acts... Are you calling me dirty? Wow. You're not just a slut, - you're also shameless. - Take that back! Stop pushing me! You're not just a whore, but immoral as well! Now, if you want to leave with a complete jaw, get in your car and drive away! Because in a minute, I'll make your head fly! Do you want that? You want to fight me? I'll tell this to Patrick! You're not being reasonable. You want this to be hard for both of us. Are you threatening me? You're selfish. Why? Am I going to abduct my child? I don't know what's in your mind. I just miss Jopet, is it bad if I want to be with him? You might not have enough time for your secretary. If I'll bring this to court, which I don't want to do, you will lose. And I'm sure that your income would not afford a lawyer. So, if you don't want any trouble. just be a good girl and be reasonable. Why are you suddenly concerned towards Jopet? All of a sudden you want to be an ideal father? Is that your mom's plan or you're just guilty? Don't make things difficult for the two of us. You know me when I want something. Finished, Patrick? Oh no, don't bother. Stay where you were. Didn't I say two o'clock? The office lunch meeting finished early, And I thought your conversation would be short. Hi, Irene. You're just in time. We're done talking. Oh, good. What time are we going to fetch your son, Patrick? You won't fetch anyone. Fix his clothes tomorrow before you leave. I'll fetch him. [soft piano playing] Oh, son. Let's eat now. Isn't that my food earlier? Yes. I reheated it, dear. - That's delicious. - That's also my food last night. Jopet, please? I'm so tired. [sobs] It was better when daddy is here. He brings me home delicious food. Do not ever mention your dad, okay? He's gone! He won't give you food anymore! Now, if you don't want to eat, go to your room! - Do not eat dinner! - I hate you! I want my daddy! I hate you! You're being stubborn now! Come here! How many times do I have to tell you not to turn back on God's blessings? You think it's easy to earn money? I'm having a hard time paying for our rent, yet you still look for delicious food? Next time, you'll eat whatever is on the table! Do you understand? Now, go to your room! [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] I hope you don’t mind. Your neighbor let us in. You're just leaving my grandson with a stranger? They aren't even related! Miss Viring is nice. That's why Jopet is getting skinny. You're not taking care of him. Jopet is no longer a baby. Better get him used to it this early because her mom needs to work. Where is his nanny? She went back to the province. Her mom is sick. It's good that he didn't get sick. The air here is dusty. It's not healthy if he won't be exposed to germs. A life full of filth. That's what I'm trying to avoid for my son. - Mommy, come with us to Greenhills. - No. Your mother will clean the house. Patrick. Come on, kiss your mom goodbye. I will only shop for the child. I don't want him to look dirty. I'll just wait for you in the car. We might have dinner outside. It looks like the child is getting skinny. [balot vendor shouting] - Hey, Boni. - Good evening. Am I disturbing you? No, it's okay. Come in. Take a seat. Thanks. You want hopia? Is that your dinner? I'm not hungry. I'm not used to eating alone. Oh. Where's Jopet? Oh. He's with his dad and grandma. I saw your husband. He's handsome. That's why I married him. And left him. Oh, why? He is so generous. He gives all girls what they want. I'm only generous with hopia. When it comes to my husband, I'm selfish. So you shouldn't be too generous. You might be forced into marriage. That's what I did. So karma is haunting me now. That's not karma. That's called life. There's a little fun and a little sadness. But I can see you're happy with Jopet. Do you have a girlfriend? Before. But she replaced me. With someone more handsome or richer? For America. She's a nurse. She wants to take care of Americans for green money. We even swore to each other, before she goes to New York. That, we'll have endless love. I'll wait for you. 'Til death do us part. Then what happened? When she got there, she stopped me writing letters. Our endless love ended. - [chuckles] - There. It's better when you're laughing. Your life will be longer. Oh, you know, Boni? When I married, I felt older. What's taking them so long? Relax. If not today, I'm sure they'll be here tomorrow. Definitely. If I started having my breakfast and my son isn't here, I'll march right to their house. Patrick! Look! Look, don't you think it's great? Look at the back. You like it? Anything you wear suits you. Really? I'll buy this now! As long as you can pull it off. Of course. Does your wife wear something like this? You know, Debbie. My wife doesn't wear those kind of clothes. Good. If she wears something like this, she'll look like a wrapped rice cake. [laughs] [giggles] I don't really wear obscene clothes! Because I don't need to expose my body just to attract men. Hi, Irene. How nice to see you again. You're so fake. Irene, please don't make a scene here. Don't interfere, am I talking to you? - Hey! Hey, you! - Stop it, Irene. Be careful with what you say. And don't ever compare me to you. I never used my body in exchange for money! Patrick. - Your wife has bad manners as well. - Debbie, please. Come on, let's go. Oh, wait. Before you drag her out. Hey, look at yourself and tell me who's indecent between the two of us? Betchay. Can you move her out? Come on, let's go. How about you, Patrick? Who will you call indecent? The one who looks like a wrapped rice cake? Or the one who's an adulterer? Well, at least, now you know Patrick left you! Correction. I'm the one who left. And you just caught him. And besides, Patrick. If you're going to replace me, at least not to a woman who's only worth a penny. It's like choosing a worn out taxi over a brand new car. - Let's go, Betchay. - How dare you talk to me that way? Are you going to allow that, Patrick? Debbie, if you don't stop, I might hit you! Let's go! This bitch! I told you, we should go. Look, we were the ones left here. [soft music playing] Sir? Coffee, no cream? Little sugar, half a teaspoon? You look different today, huh? Oh, by the way. I think, it's better if you'll always look that way. Thank you, sir. Okay. [door thuds] Boni, are you sure it's okay to leave Jopet with you? I will wait for you. Besides, I enjoy playing with this kid. Jopet, you sleep before ten o'clock, okay? I'll take care of that. When he's stubborn, I'll hit him. [chuckles] Mommy, I'll come with you. Oh son, if I could only bring you with me. But this is an event for adults only. But if I could bring you with me, you don't need to ask. I just change your clothes right away. - Irene, let's go. - Oh, hi. Come in! - Ready? - Yes! Anton, this is my neighbor, Boni. - Hi. - Anton, dude. And this is my captain, Jopet. - He's grown up, huh? - Who is he, mom? My friend, son. Okay Boni, we'll go ahead. And you, mister. Don't give your Uncle Boni a headache. Be a good boy, okay? I love you. Bye now. We'll go, dude. Bye, Jopet. Okay, bye. [screen door creaks] [screen door `1creaks] [door thuds] [screen door creaks] [door thuds] [door thuds] I don't like him. Then tell your mom. You, you are okay to me. Then you should tell her more. [engine revving] [metal gate clanks] Why? Are you mad? - No! - Why do you seem mad? It just looks like I am. Just a bit. Thank you. Oh, what's so funny? No, I just suddenly remembered. The last time I had a date, we were from a demonstration. Oh, with your ex-husband? That was a long time ago. We were just students then. The days that I thought we were really compatible. I'm sorry. Why? Why are you apologizing? I feel so awkward. I'm not used to dating anymore. Relax. We'll have a good time. Okay? You should have let him sleep upstairs. His mother will surely be home late. Don't forget that his mom is still married. Separated but still married. What's that, aunt? I said, she already has a child. Hey, Bonifacio. You didn't go here in Manila to find trouble. Focus on looking for a job and stop dreaming of being a foster father. I think, there's nothing wrong in helping people. Besides, I'm still jobless. There's nothing wrong in helping. But I feel that you are falling for her, and that's what I'm afraid of. [engine revving] Oh, Anton. Wait, wait. Why did you turn left? We should have turned right because that leads to my house. That's fine. It's easier if you took Pasong Tamo road. [suspenseful music playing] Wait, where will you bring me? Let's talk first. We've been talking in the restaurant long enough. If you want to say something, you can tell me here in the car or in my house. [suspenseful music playing] Stop the car! Stop the car or else, I'll jump! You're such an asshole! Do you think you can have me for a free dinner? You kept on asking me out, I kept on declining! I agreed for the sake of fellowship. What do you think of me? A slut? Are you going to go inside or not? - Come on! - Are you deaf? I won't! If you want to go home, then walk! [engine revving] [dramatic music playing] [engine revving] [door thuds] [engine revving] [screen door creaks] [door thuds] Oh, why did you take a cab? Where is your date? He didn't even drive you home? Thanks again, Boni, okay? What really happened? Boni, I'm already tired. I guess you are, too. Let's just rest tonight. I'll just tell you tomorrow. - Alright. - Thanks again. [screen door creaks] [metal gate clanks] [metal gate squeaks] [door thuds] [soft music playing] [door thuds] [soft music playing] [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] Mommy? Mommy? Don't cry because I love you. I love you, too, baby. Very very much. I love you very much. [soft music playing] [dramatic music playing] You sleep now. [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] - Hi. - Where have you been? It's hard to wait for nothing. There's a phone. Why didn't you even call to tell me that it was canceled? I signed papers with my business associates. Unexpectedly. I called the office around three o'clock, I was told you already left. Since when have you become a detective? Who was with you? Why do you want to know everything I do? Why are you monitoring me? I'm not an entertainer, Patrick! I'm not even a toy that you can play if you don't have anywhere to go. Damn you! You talk worse than my wife! Don't you compare me to that woman. Tell me the truth. Where have you been, and who were you with? If you're going to argue when I'm exhausted, I'll just stay at my mom's house! Patrick! Please, please don't go. Don't do this to me, please. Stay here. You know that I don't need to work as your secretary. I just did that because I love you so much. Please. Please stay with me. Okay? I need you. Don't leave me here. Stay with me. I need you desperately. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [soft music playing] [soft music playing] Hi, Myrna. Oh, hi Anton. Come, join us for coffee. No. Bye, Myrna. Bye. Why did he ignore you? Why? I won't die if he doesn't. I thought you two went on a date? How did you know? He told me. Myrna. Is it always like that when you're separated? Men don't respect you? As if you're a toy? Whether you're married, or not... There are men who just want one thing. We all know that. Why can't they court you properly? Do they think with one nudge they can get you right away? [typewriter clicking] Irene? Sir? Join me tonight in a Japanese restaurant, okay? Why, sir? I'll be dealing with a big businessman tonight. We'll do drinks. I have to be ready. We'll have to take down notes. So that by tomorrow, I know what I'll say. Okay? Okay, sir. Good. [typewriter clicking] Oh, Red. You know very well where to go with delicious Japanese food. You know that it's my favorite. I've been to all restaurants in Manila. But here is the most delicious. You like it, Irene? - Delicious, sir. - Okay. [soft music playing] [sake pouring] [soft music playing] I must say, Red. You've got a gem of a secretary here. Take care of her. If not, I'm going to pirate her. Over my dead body, Georgia. I know. Well. The deal has already been closed. Irene is even your witness. I better go. Irene. Red is kind. And he's like a bachelor. Let me assist you, so you won't change your mind with our deal. No, don't bother. I'm not a cripple. - Irene, it's so nice meeting you. - Ma'am, here's your bag. Good night, ma'am. - Bye. - Good night. [soft music playing] [exhales] So. How old were you when you got married? Sixteen, sir. Sixteen? [laughs] You wanted to, or... pardon my asking, you had to? - I had to, sir. - I see. I gave birth a few months after. I was still sixteen when I became a mother. Why did you leave your husband? For a lot of reasons. Do we still need to talk about this? Well, let's just say, I want to know you better. I guess, it's really not right for people to marry early. You think different when you're young. Mostly, physical attraction. You don't consider compatibility. The give-and-take relationship. The patience. It's like you're telling my story. You also married young, sir? Me? No. My wife is young and immature. I thought I can hide her shortcomings. I was wrong. Marriage is like a boat. Both of you need to paddle on both sides. Obviously, we are just paddling on our own. You have someone with you, but not a partner in life. Do you still love your husband? Even if I love him the most, even if I don't learn to love anymore, I can't see myself ever going back to him. [soft music playing] [door thuds] - Good evening, sir. - Are you three? - This way. - Okay. It's fine here. [door thuds] Nice place. Forget about your diet tonight. [chuckles] Let's enjoy the food. Okay, you order now. I wonder- What would you like to order? No. Allow me. Thank you. [soft music playing] The ones who just arrived, the one who's looking at us, she's the mother of my husband. I can already tell what she's thinking. It's scorching. Sir. Can we leave now? Sure. [soft music playing] Let's go. [music playing] [door thuds] Come again, sir. [music playing] I'm sorry. I don't know who to bother aside from you. We're comfortable with each other. [chuckles] I hope someday, I can repay you. You know what, Irene. I have news to tell you. I will be working. Really? Congratulations! I got lucky. I'm still under probationary for now. I will be selling medicines. Are you a drug pusher? Of course not! Those are legal medicines. You know, this is the funny thing. I'll be wearing a necktie. It will perhaps look good on you. You may be discovered as model. Don't worry. On my first payday, I will treat you. Then. When I get a permanent position, and have a higher salary, I will court you. Why did you leave the kid on the street? - What if he gets in an accident? - Mommy, look! Daddy has a gift! Jopet and I were really playing earlier. Irene asked me to help her out with the curtain. Shut up, I'm not talking to you. You're pushing it to the limit, right? What limit? This isn't the type of man who can pay for a Japanese restaurant. Do you change men everyday? That's insulting! Can you stop? My wife and I are talking so leave! - Get out! - Uncle Boni, don't! [suspenseful music playing] - Both of you, stop it! - Daddy, he's my friend! Hey! Daddy, stop it! Stop it! Stop it, please! Leave us alone, Patrick! And tell your gossiper mom to not put malice on my job! Work at a Japanese restaurant? And it's just the two of you? Mr. Sandejas is my boss! His business partner just left when your mom arrived. Oh. And while you're working, the kid was just with your neighbor. Someone cares for him. This neighbor who helps us in everything we need. Why do I have to explain to you? I'm not trying to be perfect, Patrick. But you and your mom are not saints! I hate you! [dramatic music playing] You keep on fighting! - I hate the two of you! - Jopet! [dramatic music playing] Is he still mad? I think he's confused. I think next time, he shouldn't witness a fight. He loves us all but he just couldn't understand. Can I talk to him? Please help me, I want to go up. I need to talk to him. I guess later, Irene. I will bring him home when he's already tired. Don't worry, I will take care of him. Thank you, Boni. I don't know what I will do without you. [soft music playing] [music building up] Okay. Take care of him, okay? Hop in. There! [laughter from a far] [inspirational music playing] Wait, your horse is tired. You're so corny! This horse easily gets tired. It's because you're heavy! One more! One more! Okay, one more. - Okay. - There! [inspirational music playing] I tell you, son. The sooner you get your son, the better. I'm telling you. If she's stubborn, we'll take her to court. For what? For gossipers to feast on us? Whatever! You wife's actions are more scandalous. What will happen to your son? He sees his mom with different men. Frankly speaking, I can almost see where she's heading. I don't care. At least you're rid of her. But I don't want my grandchild to be involved on her way to hell. I don't know what kind of woman she is. What she's been thinking. And you? - What is it? - A telephone call, ma'am. Hello? Hello, mommy? Is Patrick there? Can I talk to him? Oh, it's for you. Your mistress, Debbie. Can't she do anything else but follow you? Whatever! Come on! Yeah? Patrick! Patrick, bring me out. I want to go to my friend's new restaurant. I can't, mom and I will go somewhere. Where? We'll pick up Jopet then we'll go shopping. The problem with you is, all you think is Jopet. Okay. Then after that, pick me up. I'll try. We'll see, okay? I'm not sure, okay? Fine, I can't do anything about it. Okay, bye. [metal gate clanking] It's looks lousy, right? Oh! Not really. It's like- You look like you're having a hard time breathing. I even had to choose a loose collar. I feel like I'm choking. It's because your tie is on too tight. Are you leaving, Uncle Boni? Who's going to play with me? Aunt is there. I don't like her, she's rude! How can she not be rude if you're naughty? Come on, let's bring him to your aunt. [metal gate creaking] Coffee, sir? No. Maybe, dinner? Sir, your meeting with Mr. Peralta will still be on Wednesday. So who said anything about a meeting? I'm inviting you for dinner. I wasn't able to inform my neighbor who looks after my son. Some other time sir, perhaps. When it's just the two of us, stop calling me sir. My name is Red. Red. And... [clears throat] don't tell anyone, okay? Oh. I don't like explaining myself to people. I hope you understand. [clicks tongue] Could you stay a little longer? I have nowhere to go. I just want somebody to talk to. Okay? Okay. Go. Go and make coffee for the two of us. Yes, sir. If it's me, I will be really flattered. I got into this mess with Patrick because I'm too naive. Is he courting you? Maybe he's building up my confidence so I could be efficient. Please, Irene. You are so naive with men. Is he married? He's married but we're the same. Separated. - Ouch. - Hey. What's the problem then? Why will his wife leave him if he's not crazy? Why are you thinking about it? I thought he's not courting you? Is he rich? He has Benz, Pajero and BMW. Apart from his house in Dasmarinas, he also has a rest house in Caliraya. You've already checked his assets. Hey girl, listen to me. You used your heart the first time. Now, for goodness' sake. Use your mind this time. And if those guys are just a pain in the ass... At least! You won't be too hurt, because you have money for shopping. [soft music playing] - Sir? - Yes. - Ma'am? - Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead, open it. [soft music playing] Sorry, sir. I cannot accept this. There is no occasion. Just try it. Please. Go ahead. I can’t accept this, sir. I'm sorry. Why? Are you scared you'll get in trouble? Sir? Red. I just want to be safe. Look, Irene. I'm not going to force you to do anything, that you don't want. Price on the tip, okay? - You're married. - I'm married. We're both separated. We're both lonely. We can help each other. We are at the right age to know what is right, and what is wrong. We're not doing anything against our conscience. Besides, you have a six-year-old son. You take care of him. But who takes care of you? Now. Is it a sin to look for someone you can share your life with? For people like us who are both married, it's so wrong. In people's eyes, it's cheating. In the eyes of God, it's adultery. [sighs] Let's not be too hard on ourselves. I believe, we have the right to be happy. You're kidding. - Of course not. - Okay. One of these days, I'll challenge you. Show me that you can beat me. Okay. You'll get humiliated though. But I noticed, it's like- Why aren't your legs muscular if you're really a tennis champion? I guess, my legs are just not muscular. [door thuds] And you're going to tell me that she's the Japanese client you're entertaining? You're entertaining her too much. Do you also earn from her? Patrick, who is she? I think I should be the one to ask that question. Debbie, stop it. Just let us go if you don't want any trouble. Try! - Patrick, what's happening? - Can you please leave? - If you don't want to make a scene. - Are you threatening me? Okay, try it! You can't do this to me, you animal! - You can't do this to me! - Debbie! I will kill you! - I will kill you before you leave me! - Can you shut up? [screams] Let me go! Damn you! Let me go! I said, let me go! - Open the door! - Wait! Open the door! Give me a second! [door thuds] Wait! Bear this in mind. Don't ever humiliate me in public. Now, go home. Sit there. Wait until I want to come home. What time? What? What if I don't want to go home tonight? - When? - Whenever I want! Now, go home! - Get inside! - Okay! [door thuds] [door thuds] [door thuds] [slams the door] When are we going home, mommy? This is where we live, son. How about daddy? He lives in a different house now. Grandma Meldy said, you don't like my daddy anymore. Is that true, mommy? She's lying. Jopet. Not everything that your grandma will say is true. You won't replace daddy even if you don't like him? Why? Do you want a new daddy? Of course not, I already have a dad. But if it's Uncle Boni, it's okay. What did you say? Why? Did Uncle Boni refuse to be my dad? [chuckles] Oh, come on! Go ahead and sleep now! You're just sleepy. Oh, you sleep now. You pray, okay? In the Name of Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Why did you come back? So you can laugh at me? You know what, you're funny. Because you have realized your stupidity. [crickets chirping] Earlier. I was thinking of committing suicide. Well. Maybe you're not worth it after all. Why? [keys clatters] I love you, Patrick. I can't give you what you want. Is it really hard to love me? That's the only thing I want. The problem with you, you're not content with what you get. You want to own my whole being. That's impossible. You're too possessive! Bear this in mind, Patrick. If I can't have you, then nobody should have you, too. [dramatic music building up] [dramatic music playing] Grandma Meldy's house is so big. Even my garden is big, right? And the fridge is full of your favorite chocolates. Unlike this ugly house. - Oh, Miss Viring. - Your mother-in-law is here. - Huh? - And your husband! Where? In Jopet's room, they're changing his clothes. They'll go out again. Don't let his grandma bring him out. He might adapt their bad attitude. Thank you so much, Miss Viring. Will my mom come with us? She wants to stay here. Do you really like it here? How about my mom? I will leave her here? She chose to stay here. She'll leave you here. Then, she goes out without you. Does your mom bring you somewhere like your dad? - No. - There! Does she buy you new toys like your dad? No. You look like your dad! Every time- Every time you go with your dad, he buys you new toys. Right, Patrick? Do you still want to add things to say to my child? Irene, we'll bring him out. - You can't. - Why not? Because I don't want to. Irene, let's not argue about this okay? We're peaceful without you. So please? Leave us alone. Hey! Patrick is Jopet's father! If he wants to get his son, he has the right. The right to bad-mouth me and brainwash him? Maybe I'm not like you who eats diamonds. But I'm smarter than both of you. Even if you combine your brains! Patrick, did you hear what this woman said about us? Stop being disrespectful to my mother. - Just shut up! - No, you shut up! This is my house, I have the right to shout! You both entered the house without permission, and you are trespassing! - Jopet! - Jopet! - [screams] - Jopet, come to grandma. - Jopet! - Jopet! You see what you've done to my son? And you? Did you see what you've done to my child? [suspenseful music playing] [suspenseful music playing] [suspenseful music playing] [suspenseful music playing] Jopet! Where is that child? Jopet! It's your fault, you woman! We were having a nice conversation before you entered! Why do you keep pestering us? - Can you please stop! - You should be blamed! You! Why are you meddling? Jopet! - Jopet! - Patrick, look! Oh my God! Oh my God, look! Jopet! [suspenseful music playing] Jopet, don't move! Daddy's coming, okay? Stay away! Don't come near me! [sobs] Jopet, son, don't move! You might fall! Don’t move! Don't come near me! Aunt. I will just bring this gift to Jopet. Oh, nobody's there! What? Where are they? They shouted at each other earlier. The kid ran outside. Then, Irene followed. And her husband, and the witch mother-in-law. I don't know if they caught Jopet. Which direction did he run to? Somewhere there! Please hold this. What are you waiting for? Go up and get the kid! No, don't! He might get scared! Let's talk to him first. Why talk? He's just a kid! - Mom please, will you shut up? - Go! Give this to me, okay? Then go! Don't go here! I hate you! I hate all of you! Jopet, please! Don't move, okay? Daddy's coming. [suspenseful music playing] Boni, there's Jopet! [suspenseful music playing] Jopet. Jopet, come on. Jopet, come to daddy. Come on. Jopet, mommy and I are sorry for what happened. Just leave! Come on, let's go down. I'll support you. I hate you! You don't really love mommy! You don't love me as well! Uncle Boni! Tell them to leave! Jopet. Don't be so stubborn. Jopet. - Come here, son. - [sobs] Come on, Jopet. Jopet, don't be stubborn! I'm about to get angry! [sobs] [suspenseful music playing] - Jopet! - Jopet! [suspenseful music playing] [crowd chattering] - Jopet! - Jopet! Jopet, my son! Don't carry him, it might worsen. Help! Somebody! - Please call a doctor! - Please help us! [poignant music playing] Jopet. Jopet. Jopet. [poignant music playing] You'll be alright, Jopet. I promise you, son. You'll be alright. [sobs] Just hang on son, okay? Hang on. Keep fighting, son. [sobs] [sobs] Baby. Jopet. [sobs] Hold on, son. No matter how much, don't let the cost stop you. Just cure my son. I don't want to give you false hope. Just let my son live! We have done everything. Even if he lives... Doctor, what will happen now? Please. His spinal column is broken. He might be comatose. I already told you that I'm willing to pay! If we could only buy a life. Mommy? Son? Mommy. I am sorry. Because, I'm a bad boy. My God, no. Who said that you're a bad boy? You're a good boy, right? Thank you, mommy. I love you. I love you, too, son. Jopet? Jopet! Jopet! Doc! Doc, what's happening? Jopet! Jopet! Jopet! Doc! Doc! Doc! Doc! My son! [poignant music playing] [sobs] [poignant music playing] [poignant music playing] [wails] Jopet! Jopet, no! [wails] No, Jopet! Oh God! No! Jopet! [poignant music playing] Jopet! Jopet! Jopet! Jopet! Jopet! Jopet! [wails] [wails] Jopet! [door thuds] Jopet! No! No! No! No! No, Jopet! No! [poignant music playing] No! Jopet! My baby! My baby! Jopet! Jopet! Merciful Father. In Your protection, we are offering You the late Jopet, who we love so dearly. May Your comforting love save him. May he will be lead to Your great paradise. No more pain. No more sufferings and sadness. Because only peace prevails. Together with Your Son, and Holy Spirit. Forever and ever. Amen. For those who were left by Jopet, think that death is not the end. It is only the beginning. We will not obtain eternal life in the Kingdom of God, if the temporary life here on earth will not end. So don't cry over his death. Goodbye to you, our brother. May God be with you. Bring God's blessings with you. In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. [poignant music playing] Amen. The blessing is over. Let's go home. You go ahead. Don't tell me you'll stay here late? You're not even related to the boy. For me, Jopet is family. Oh my, Bonifacio. I'll write about this to your mother. Irene. My condolences. Thank you. Sir, they're my parents. They're my brother and my sister-in-law. How are you? Sir, take a seat. Stay where you are. I can manage. [poignant music playing] Why is that monkey even here? Ogie. Take him out of here before we mourn for two people. Dad, that is Jopet's father. [poignant music playing] [poignant music playing] [poignant music playing] [poignant music playing] [poignant music playing] [poignant music playing] [poignant music playing] [poignant music playing] [wails] My child. It’s hard when you're alone. No one will look after you. Irene. It's better if you go home with us. I want to be alone. To find myself. We need you more at home. You sister-in-law has given birth now. You know much better with kids than her, right? You can help her. Soon. Mom. I know you are tired. Me, too. I want to rest. This is my home, mom. I don't want to live in another house. When you change your mind, if you need me, just call me. [sobs] [dramatic music playing] [screen door creaks] Haven't you returned to work yet? You might get fired. It's fine. You look pale. It seems like you're not getting enough sun. You might get sick. Much better. Irene. What do you really want to prove to yourself? Why do you keep on pestering me? Go and sell medicines, leave me alone. What do you want people to give you? Pity? What do you want? You want to see them cry? So you can be a martyr? Who's asking for your opinion, Boni? It's my life! Whatever I want to do with my life, it's up to me! And whatever help you've done for me and my son, it isn't a reason for you to meddle with my life! Do you think I'm not hurting? That I'm not in pain? I also loved your son. Not only you. There's a lot of us. But it doesn't mean that the world will stop turning because we lost a loved one. I don't think I can go on living, Boni. Irene. I'm so lost. Be strong. If you're giving up, think of him. How will Jopet rest in peace if he sees you like this? I can't go on, Boni. Stop it. Stop it, Irene. - I can't! - Stop it. I really can't! [wails] - I'll do this. - Thank you. Irene. Don't feel sorry. I don't want to cry again. Are you okay now? Sir Red is not expecting you to work. This is my job. Does he have a visitor? His wife is inside. She just got back from the States. Oh, really? Okay. [door thuds] You're unbelievable, Red. Your coffee, sir. That's for her. Just leave it there. Oh. So, this is Irene. She's the flavor of the month, sweetheart? Lory, let's not try to be witty. I was just asking a simple question, Red. - When have you become sensitive? - Lory. Sir. Do you still need anything from me? Perhaps later, when I leave. Not in front of me, right? Ma'am? One thing about my dear husband, Irene. He may have lost a lot of things. But, there is still some manners left, somehow. You can go now, Irene. Thank you, sir. Ma'am. Enjoy it while it lasts, dear. [door thuds] Oh well, Red. I must admit, you still have a good taste. But, it's getting younger and younger. How did you get rid of the last one? The small girl with a curly hair. Did you buy her a new car? [whines] This is terrible. Red, how could you? She doesn't even know how to make coffee. Did you come here to talk about our papers, or to cause trouble? Why, Red? Don't tell me the truth hurts. [door thuds ] You have a visitor downstairs, sir. [crickets chirping] Patrick? Why didn't you tell me? That's why I rushed here the moment I found out. Tell me what made you come here. I want to rest. Are you getting rid of me? I'm just telling the truth. Don't you want to keep it real? Look, Patrick. I know it was too painful for you. Come on. Come with me. You need me now. I'll take care of you. I will. What will I do for- For you to learn that we're over? You won't listen to me! Even if I keep telling you repeatedly. Are you that oblivious? [dramatic music building up] Are you? Damn you! I loved you, asshole! I loved you! You deserve everything that's happening to you right now! I wish that all your loved ones die! Asshole! They should all die! We're not yet done! You just can't leave Debbie like that! Remember that! [door thuds] [door thuds] [paper rustles] It doesn't have to be this way. That's already my decision, sir. Red. Sir. [tongue clicks] I can help you. I know. But I don't want that to be the reason for me to care for you, sir. You can't pay indebtedness with love. [sighs] You don't have to resign. I don't want to get mad at you, or at myself. It was nice working for you, sir. Sir, I've realized something. I don't want to love anybody because I need him for other reasons aside from wanting to love him. [dramatic music building up] [dramatic music playing] Thank you, sir. Goodbye. [dramatic music playing] [door thuds] [door thuds] [dramatic music playing] You teenagers mostly rush into marriage. And rush into divorce as well. So, what now? Are you going to sell all appliances in this house and divide the money? Or are there things you want to dispose? Both will do, attorney. Besides, the things here won't match my apartment. You might want to think things over. Come here, Irene. Let's be together again. Get your clothes then live here. I can't. I will always think of Jopet. Let's buy a house somewhere far from here. We won't escape the memories. It’s here! It's always with us. I don't believe that you don't love me anymore. You still love me. Damn it! Is my repentance not enough? Attorney, are the papers for our separation of properties ready? Yes, just give me a minute. I thought you both will reconcile. I want to sign it now. I still need to do a lot of things.

At first. But now, I've already accepted it. That our son passed away. God knows what's best. He has His reasons. I love Jopet very much. We both love him. I need you, Irene. No, Patrick. You’re my wife. It was wrong for us to get married so early. We already know that. For people like us, it’s better if we part ways. Why is it so hard for you to believe what I say? [door thuds] I knew, I'd find you here. Aren't you going to stop? Get out! Go! [suspenseful music playing] You thought it's easy to get rid of me? I'm not like your stupid wife who allows herself to be maltreated. Debbie, stop that. Don't you even dare. I'm not kidding! Now... Tell in front of that woman who you love. Who do you truly love? Shout it! Who do you really love? [suspenseful music playing] [gunshot fired] You! Both of you! You always bring trouble! Okay. Now leave! When you come back, this gun will both end your life. Go! Leave! Since then, you always bring trouble! You think we're done? Even if you hide from hell, I will find you! - Damn you! - Damn you, too! [door thuds] [engine starting] [engine revving] [engine revving] Now. Stop your stubbornness. What you need is a man who will protect you. And that's me. Now. - Do you have any complaints? - It's because- [Kahit Wala Ka Na Performed by: Sharon Cuneta]
