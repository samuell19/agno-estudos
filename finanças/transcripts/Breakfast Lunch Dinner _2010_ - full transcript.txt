If we look at it, there's an overwhelming sense of sadness The fate of two generations. The fate of her family Also, I feel that this seems to make a woman's fate tragic Yes, she's Pakistan's first female Prime Minister The world's youngest female Prime Minister The first of a few... What is that? A compass? Yes Planning to travel? No, just for fun What is so fun about that? I never seem to get my directions right around this area You are not local? I've been here for 2 years but I always lose my bearings in this area I don't mean to brag. Not knowing this side of the city is normal I have driven for many years The local drivers are ok but those from other places will be lost Due to the lake ahead which you'll see in a bit It obstructs the road. So we have to build the tunnel and viaduct Comrades, your attention please North-bound Train No 454 leaving the West Station is at Platform 2 Comrades, your attention please North-bound Train No 454 leaving the West Station is at Platform 2 Passengers at the end of the queue: purchase your tickets from Counters 10, 11 and 12 Tickets to all cities within the next 9 days are available at these 3 counters Passengers at the end of the queue: purchase your tickets from Counters 10, 11 and 12 Tickets to all cities within the next 9 days are available at these 3 counters Mei! Have you been waiting long? Not really. It was too stuffy inside so I came out I was writing my articles till late last night. And slept at 3am I woke up late. Tried calling you, but your mobile phone was turned off I fell asleep on the train And realised later that my phone had run out of battery I called you from that public phone Where shall we go now? Let us walk around first My flatmate will leave around noon Oh He has been working overtime And can only leave at noon When you are here for good We will find a new place for ourselves Let's eat something first? How long have you not had breakfast? Let's leave. It is very noisy everywhere The train heading in the direction of the Olympic Stadium is arriving Please do not stay close to the door And wait behind the safety line When boarding, please take note of the gap between the platform and the door Are these for your publisher? No, I simply take them for fun It has become a habit Whenever I pass by a newsstand, I'll take a picture I got this at the outdoor adventure shop Why buy such a multi-purpose gadget? You do not go camping It's entertaining Take it, since you run around so much This may come in handy The next station: Mingji Hospital Zhongsheng Stop Please alight from the right side of the train Waitress, 2 bowls of wonton The temperature is so low It's only slightly above 10 °C Thank you 60% humidity It's rather comfortable Not as dry as the north Where can I buy this? You can get this anywhere. Even in the supermarkets Are you getting one? Another multi-purpose gadget It is good to have one at home I can know my surroundings anytime So? It's good to know You're from the north? Just arrived here? You're still not used to the climate here, I suppose She is. I am from Chungming Oh, Chungming. That's near Shanghai Quite a big island Are you new here? I have never seen you before This is my uncle's restaurant Will be torn down soon The workers have all left so I am here to help Oh... The state is going to lay the tracks here Hello. How do I get to Bai Xia Road? Let me take a look From here you go through Ji Qing Gateway Turn left and you will be at Sheng Zhou Road Then go past two junctions. Turn left again and you'll be there So troublesome Yes. The traffic there is one-way. So be careful Okay, thank you These were taken a few months ago My instincts have been very sharp recently It happens that whenever I want to go to a place There'll be matters I need to go there Perfect opportunities to take some pictures for my thesis Where were these taken? This is East Lake in Wuhan This seems fun This is Hou-hai It is already freezing in the north And many were playing ice hockey over the frozen lakes This is Lake Jinyang in Taiyuan It has become a dumping ground for industrial water The power plant next to it discharges hot water into the lake The hot water comes into contact with the ice Forming these white lines It's rather peculiar When you get closer to the lake You'll hear a very strange noise coming from it Something like the sound of a motor You must be exhausted Having gone to so many places Every place is quite fun But staying at one place can be rather boring Wonton Thanks I attended Xiao Shi's wedding last month They have to eat dumplings when they get married Supposedly symbolise the kneading together of 2 lives It's rather interesting The wonton I used to eat were those small ones The size of my thumb It was only when I got to the south That I realised there are bigger ones Like dumplings in the north Those old classmates of ours Are getting married one after another When are we getting married? It's still too early. Why think about it? Waitress. Do you have any more chilli? On the next table Oh, sorry The weather's got colder. Eating chilli keeps you warm How nice if we could be like the birds They migrate to warmer regions when the weather turns cold Just like that place It must be very comfortable over there now? Have you thought of what to do after graduation? To look for a job or continue studying? There'll be a few recruitment fairs these few days Like to go take a look? We'll see Have you thought of changing your job? You can be a photographer at National Geographic, for example I can then move around with you Me? I prefer to be led Sleepy? My flatmate should be leaving soon Would you like to sit for a while Or would you prefer to go elsewhere? How about going for a movie? The theatre should open soon Thelasttime, we could still go rowing in the park But the lake is almost frozen now We can't possibly go to the park, can we? Want a ride? Sightseeing on a coach - No need - The park is very big There's really no need It's a guided tour of the park You can stop at scenic spots to take photos I can even take you to the lover's garden No, we will walk We are now having a discount for the off-peak season It's only half the price I really think it's fine You will regret it Where are we now? Let me see... We are here There's a bird sanctuary there The bird sanctuary is on that island Are we also on an island now? Yes You can only tell it's an island when you're a distance away But not when you're standing on it When I was 10, my father first took me out of Chungming Only then did I realise I was living on an island My father fell ill last month I wanted to return to the island to visit him But I had a whole pile of write-ups to be completed So I applied for leave Perhaps the editor had been unhappy with me recently He told me to complete all my work before taking leave It was actually a whole heap of useless reports Anyone could have done it I worked through the night And the next morning, without even washing up I went to the office to submit my papers On the way home I took a bus I felt really sad and unjustified The bus was very packed I fell asleep When the bus made an abrupt turn A girl lost her balance and fell onto me I was about to complain When she started picking up her many bags and apologised profusely to me At that moment I was rather moved I had a sudden impulse to offer her my seat But I still had a few more stops to go If I had given her my seat And she sees me still standing next to her She would likely misunderstand To avoid any misunderstanding I should alight once I gave up my seat But... I was really exhausted What happened next? I did not give up my seat I sat there until I reached home Hello? Hello? Hold on Okay, sure. Got it We're at the park Will be back in a while You're coming back on Monday? No problem I'll look for a room elsewhere when you are back Okay. Bye! Where's that girl who was here earlier?
