Are you falling apart? I wanna watch you all day. - Please don't go. Not this time. Come back to me. - No one will change this. It's a promise. I love you. Today, November 15th, 2020 marks the inception of the United States of Europe. From this day on, the world will consist of one undivided nation. - Taurus City watches as this democracy falls, replaced by a new dictatorship. The war in the Middle East is creating fronts of poor refugees. ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ - Disorder and drugs. - Taurus City has erupted in chaos. The underground Malaki movement known only as The Union has now occupied an industrial complex. Michael Ocean of the Ocean Corporation has continued his takeover of the street. He now controls the police force and with his private army has occupied Taurus City. Sources say that Michael Ocean is the king behind the very structure of the entire drug trade. An investigation has begun on Michael Ocean and the Ocean Corporation's links to drug trafficking. Piling conflicts continued between The Union and Taurus City law enforcement in a surprise protest-- - A small protesting-- - This state of national law. - Michael Ocean has ordered a city wide curfew. There is not in a street. The Ocean Corporation, the oil industry giant, has one of the biggest holds in the Middle East market. And remember, the Ocean Corporation is financing the war and Middle East terrorism and he's working tirelessly to find revenue and meta methods to assure the safety The United States of Europe. - Long night? Please, join me. They put this out for me every day, who on earth can eat all this food? But, please, join me. Sometimes, we get caught by the storm. Come back to me. It's a special day for our benefactor, Mr. Ocean. The anniversary of Taurus City marks the liberation of our city in the state of chaos. To celebrate the 10-year anniversary, Ocean rise to leadership of Taurus City, the Ocean Corporation has organized... And remember, the Ocean Corporation is financing the war on the Middle East. - Which one you like? And is working restlessly to find revenue and meta methods to ensure the safety and protection-- - Me too. My son had this car. When my daughter was a little girl, I took her to the fair. And I won her that fish, you know the games where you throw the rings, and 99 times out of 100, you just lose your money, but I was lucky, I won. A plastic bag with a tiny goldfish in it. She was so happy. You should have seen her face, so much joy. We had the fish for two weeks, and then, there he was, floating on the bowl. She cried half a day, we had to stage a funeral for the fish. You see, that's what we try to teach our children. That life is precious, that life matters. You know, you can leave if you want. Who are you? - I'm no one. And I have to find her. Penelope! Who is it? - Penelope? - Who? - Where's Penelope? - No, no, no, no, no, no, wrong apartment. You are in the wrong place, you are in the wrong place. - Don't fuck with me. Understand? I've lived here for years. - Who is the Italian stallion? - What do you want? - Penelope! - I'm going to call the police! - Is that him? I'll kill him! - No, stop it! - He broke in! - Bullshit, he's naked! - Leave him. - Papa, call the police! - Are you fucking crazy? I have my business here! - I have my business here too! - Calling no pigs! - Papa give me the phone. Papa give me the phone! - He's just a pussy! - He hit my husband. 1452 Green Avenue. - You are so stupid, I called the cops. So you think you are big until they'll get you and they going to break your... What are you doing? Are you fucking kidding me? - Stop, stop, stop! From the beginning. - It looks really a good deal, Mr. Ocean. This may be just the best anniversary party Taurus City is ever gonna see. - You're a fan of Opera now, Tony? - This? The story is not really my cup of tea, is it? - No, no, no, stop, stop, stop! - Then shut up your mouth up about it. - Okay again, from the beginning. - I'm sure it'll be alright on the night. - Are you here to waste my time? - Look, I got a call. They're saying he's back. - No, no, no, it doesn't work. - Where is he? - I don't know yet, but I've got a lot of people out looking for him. - Search every corner of my city. I give you 24 hours to bring him to me. And she can never find out. Why are you still here? - Mr. Ocean, Mr. Ocean, I apologize, but we-- - Fix it, now. - Long time. - Somebody is waiting for me. - Don't fucking move motherfucker or I'll pull the trigger. Welcome back brother. - Niko, I thought you were dead. - I was, you brought me back. - I've gotta go take care of her first, go fast. You two look like a fucking Michael Jackson video. What are we waiting for? Move! You've changed, Uly. - You haven't. - Where you been? - Someone took me. - You're surprised? With all the people you pissed off? Who was it? - I don't know. I can't remember. My mind... All I remember are dark shadows. - How long? And Penelope? - They took her too. - Well, I guess we oughta get her back. - I need your help. - As always, brother. - Enter the eye of horus. - Popov. Time to go. - Just like the old days. - Jules, say you get a conviction, and the guilty motherfucker's getting his sentence. Three extra years for any crime committed in a building with no elevator. - Okay, well, let's say there is an elevator but it's busted? - 18 months. - Maybe you should stop smoking and get more exercise. - And you should learn to work less and live more. You can-- - I know, find a man, settle down, whatever. - When I was in the Army, I learned to be more pragmatic. What I gonna say was get yourself a dog. - Mrs. Cifuentes, I'm Agent Delfin and this is my partner, Agent Marino. Are you alright? - Wrong question, Jules. - No, I'm not alright! I had a crazy man run into my house and punched my husband in the nose. - Do you know who he was? - Yes, she knows, she fucked him. - I do not know who he is. - He stole my flask! - Well, it seems to me you're not running out of whiskey. - That's his stuff. - Enough! Did he take anything else? - Yes, he took my cellphone. Shit. Out. You must be hungry. - I'm looking for somebody. Yeah, aren't we all? - My wife. - Penelope, suck on me, go down on me, Penelope. Yeah, I know who she is. I haven't yet had the pleasure but I'm really looking forward to... Tasting her. Hold your horses there, Cochise. You're not Mr. Ocean's golden boy anymore, are you? You had it all, all you had to do was stay on your own side of town. But you couldn't, could you? And now it's all gone. And Penelope? Well she is, as they say, moved on. Seven years. She has forgotten your sorry ass. - Seven years? - You don't remember very much, do you? - Be safe. - Yeah, have a look and send me anything you got. Okay, great. Alright well, they're gonna look into past tenants. - Did you run a trace on her cell? - Yeah, it's already dead. But he did make one call. - To whom? - A disconnected number. Sounds like a really dangerous guy. - Not without this. She should never have opened the door. - Look, she didn't know he was coming. - I'm pretty sure it's not the first time she had a naked man at her door. - That was cold, you're too pessimistic. - No, I'm pragmatic. - Welcome back from the dead. Hello sunshine! Now listen, tell you something interesting. You know in China, they like to torture the animals before slaughter. I don't buy it myself, all that panic it just sours the meat. But the sweetest are your drug addicts, you shoot 'em full of the good stuff and they don't even feel the blade slide in, and everyone says to me "Oh Popov, "you make the best kebabs in the city." You know people disappear all the time. And I help them. It's survival of the fittest, nothing personal. And my role in this process is crucial. - It's a shame. - What? - Black market gift and I don't even know how it fucking tastes. Oh. - It's a special reserve of the finest whiskey in town. - Well. Wait, you know I don't like to drink alone. So, would you mind? That's it. Okay, so we're celebrating, okay. I don't see anything, oh, Jesus, I'm gonna fucking kill you! Where are you? - Don't eat that. Stay here, I have a few questions for him. Wake up darling. - You are so fucking crazy. - You have no idea. - Penelope, where is she? - I don't know. Why aren't you dead? You're supposed to be dead. - Who says? - Fuck you. - Thank you. You get where this is going? - Don't get that shit on my shoes. - One by one, your senses go bye bye. Touch, smell. - Taste you can keep because you need your tongue to talk. - I'm not telling you shit! - Wrong answer. - No, no, no, no, all right, all right, okay. It was a faggot, I did it for the faggot. - Tell me more. - Aeo, seven years ago, he shows up with a case full of money. I was supposed to do my job on you and take the girl. It was my part in his little plan. But you were already gone, and so the plan changed. Go on. - I don't know anymore, it's all I know. - Aeo has Penelope? - I don't know, ask him. - Tell me more! I can't, I can't tell you what I don't know. - Tell me more motherfucker! Leave him to me. I have a few questions too. - No, no, no, no, no, no, don't leave me here ike this. - You gonna be alright? - Who are you? - I'm no one. - You know. - Darling. - If you wanted to see me, you could have just called or come by. Penelope. - Instead, two gangsters show up at my front door, hustle me. And your dog has nothing to say. - You told me to bring her. - We have a very sensitive problem. I'm sorry that sometimes the nature of my business means that you have to deal with this. What happened? - Look, we're only trying to protect you. - Out. Tomorrow is the anniversary of Taurus city. Every 10 years I have the possibility-- - To celebrate yourself. - It is very important to me. But I know that maybe someone would hurt you. And my first thought was to bring you here, where I can protect you. Is that so wrong? Isn't that how any father would react? - Welcome to Cacao Island, home of Aeo. God of winds and dear to the immortal gods. Revere him, it's your only hope on this long night. - Get the fuck off, shit! - Johnny? Where's Penelope? Go out. - Where is she? - Ms. Vasilescu, I understand you've been through a lot. We gotta ask you a few questions. - No, he's talking to a witness. Send it to me now. Okay, keep us posted. So the landlord found his name, Johnny Ferro. Do you know him? - Ms. Vasilescu, is this the same guy? - Yeah, that's him. That's Mr. No One. What? - He's the one who saved my life. - You're sure? This man saved your life? - Yeah, I swear. Shit, get this picture to every cop in the city. - Where are we going? Same place as Johnny. - Stop calling me that. - Seven years. - Is that why you fucked me? - I guess you would have been the one getting fucked. - The fuck am I supposed to do with this? - I'm not your runner anymore. - We don't have time for this shit. - Don't fuck with me. - Thank you. - Thanks. - How's the fish? - You still get it from that old Greek? - No, he retired, his nephew now, nice man, young family. He brings it here, brings what he likes. - How do you make it sound so civil? - What? - He brings it, because if he doesn't pay the price of his freedom, the great Ocean would have his deliveries delayed, his employees bullied at the market and his nice young family harassed and terrorized, until he either goes out of business, or kneels to kiss your feet. Everything you have is built on fear. - This fish is on your plate because he ate the other smaller fish until he became big, and strong enough to swim free and get caught in the net and brought to the market. I'm not the fish, or the net, or the fishmonger. I am the market. It's a setup, Uly, it's gotta be. I have no choice. - You get caught with that shit. Throw that shit away. - That doesn't get me any closer to Penelope. - Neither does this. - Listen, we'll take it slow, find all the ways in and all the ways out. - Tactical recon. The last time we followed that plan, it didn't work out so well, did it? - Sometimes you have to make a decision, right or wrong. - And live or die with the consequences? - This life that you think you live, this normal you crave for. That is the lie. - I do not accept that. - You say that I built my life on fear; I fear that I will never again have the love of my child. You blame me for Johnny. - Tomorrow would have been-- - I know you do. You had to have someone to blame, so why not me? - Papa. - He never came back from the war. He came to me. He begged for a chance to work, a chance to provide for you. "Husband to father," he said, "for the woman we both love." What's the plan? - Go in the back. They have to think I'm alone. - Johnny. The last time your position was no better. - I did not kill him. I wouldn't kill my daughter's husband. Even if I hated him, even if he betrayed me. There are things that even I wouldn't do. - Then what happened to him? - Who knows? - Oh my God, oh my God! Oh my God, oh my God, no. No, no, no, no. - It's not your fault. I'm sorry. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. - Oh shit. Uly, move! - Shit, don't sneak up on me like that! - Sorry. - Where were you? - Here. I was here the whole time. What's wrong? - Nothing. Just in my own world. - Maming that psycho was one thing, but killing a cop? It was an accident. - They're not gonna make that distinction. They're gonna hunt you down. - They already are. - Uly! Let it go! It's too big, it's too much! Don't you see that? She thinks you're dead! Has it crossed your mind that maybe the best thing-- - I have to find Penelope. - Then what? - She'll know the truth. - What's the truth, Uly? What's true? Do you even know anymore? - The truth is I have no choice, Niko. If she wants a life without me, I'll accept it. But I would die to see her one more time. - So what now? - Now? - You know, being a dog. Loyal, remember? - Tomorrow. - Is nearly here. The anniversary of Taurus City will happen. Your father has organized everything and he really wants you by his side. What? If your drug dealer lets you down, it's about boarded, taxed. Totally legal. Doctor gave me them for my anxiety. - Hard to imagine Tony Heald with anxiety. - It's been seven years. - You've never met him, have you? No. - He was free. Holding his hand was like flying a kite. Only the wind knew where it would take him. - Love is the strangest thing. It's a gear, you know. People can see they love you, but how do you know it's there? I don't think I've ever been loved. But you are. Until the end, I'll look after you. Like you were, as always. He is not gonna be here forever. All this one day is going to be mine. I want to look after you. I wanna take care of you. You don't have to worry about anything. - Thank you. - Your report says you fired the round that killed Marino. - It's true, Captain. I drew on Johnny Ferro and, I had my gun down for a second. And then-- - This the kind of event that destroys careers, Detective. I think you're confused, concussions do that shit, they scramble your brain. I think what really happened was you lost your gun in the fight, and Johnny Ferro killed Detective Marino. - That's not how it went down. - Try a little pragmatism here, Detective Delfin. - Pragmatism is the one thing that Marino taught me. - You should have shot the dog. - You expected me to walk it back here after you sent me into a trap? - An address staked out by two Taurus City detectives. So you did know. - I didn't kill any... Shit. Put it down! Enough! - That was a warning. Let him up. Baby. - It's done. Done? No baby. - No? This, this, this, this, this? Let him up! - Give me the gun. - I said go. Go! - Uly! Fuck you. Where's Penelope? - Suck this! - You're already dead. - Get in! - Why did you help? - You were kind to me, once. You really, you don't remember? - Pieces. Nothing's in order. - Where you taking us? - Yeah, where are we going? - A friend. - Yours or mine? - No, she's not a friend of mine. But it could be one of the only places in the city you'll be safe. I won't be coming back. You know why, Johnny? Change is everything I've ever known. It's my adaptation, it's what I do to survive in a world that I wasn't built for. - Whatever kindness I showed you, you more than repaid. Thank you. Good luck, Johnny. - I know this place. - Of course you do. Niko? - Johnny Ferro. - Cici. - Where have you been? - In my head, nothing's right. I don't remember things I should, and the things I do remember, they're broken up, confused. You need rest. - Were we lovers? - One of us loved, anyway. - Penelope? - Yes. Every time you came back from the war, you were worse. You changed and she was unhappy. - I changed? - Drugs. - I was a drug dealer. - You were the best one. Michael Ocean's golden boy. You used to watch product move around the Middle East during his military missions. But one day something happened. Your love for her, your rebellious spirit. You saw something that changed your life, and you became the Prince of the City. - Prince of the city. - And Mr. Ocean didn't like it. Johnny. Kiss me. Time to go. - You can stay here, with me. You'll be safe. I'll take care of you, I'll protect you. Stay here. - What kind of a man would I be then? Any kind you wanna be. - I can't. - Why? Penelope? - I have to find her. - She doesn't want you. The Seer. Maybe he can help you to remember who you really were. At least this time, I get to say goodbye, before you go to hell. - The Seer. - I know where. - Shit, when were you born? Fuck. Shit. Pragmatic. Okay. 78910717 Robert is on the 901. - So apparently he went to Cici's. - She called? - No. - I'll tell you. I sent him to The Seer. - It's time to put the blunt instruments to work. - Holy shit, is Uly back from the dead. - We're here for The Seer. - But I'm not here. - For who? For anybody. - I ain't seen nobody. Welcome back to hell. ♪ Come with me ♪ ♪ Come with me ♪ ♪ Come with me ♪ ♪ Come with me ♪ ♪ Come with me ♪ I'll see you later. - You're not coming in? - No, brother. Here too, what's in here is for you. - Hey Kitty-Kitty, hey Kitty-Kitty. Hey Kitty-Kitty, hey, hey Kitty-Kitty. Hey Kitty-Kitty, hey Kitty-Kitty. Hey Kitty-Kitty, hey Kitty-Kitty. Well, well, well. Look what the cat's dragged in. You, my bright son, have fallen a long, long way. But I see you still have that set of big shiny brass balls, coming down here, with me, after all this time. Calling all units. Suspect confound position in Industrial District. Possible armed members on site. Proceed with caution. - Who did this one? - I don't remember. - You don't remember much, do you? - Will I see Penelope again? - How about this? - Penelope. - Yes, you'll see her again and you'll see him too. - Him? - Him, last time you came down here, you nearly got all of us killed. He won't forgive a second trespass. - Look, I need-- - You don't know what you need. I'm not what I was seven years ago. And The Union. Hell, I'm old, and I'm lucky enough to have what crumbs fall from the chessboard. But I don't try to fight my fate, I embrace it. I accept the past to get to the future. I got a present for you. Yeah, I got a present for you, okay, okay. - A present? Funny cat, get out. Yes, yes, okay. - What's that? - Make a fist. - No, no, no, what are you doing? No, no, no. - Do you wanna remember or do you wanna keep prancing around like that half-assed horse on your shoulder? - I want my-- - Then you need to remember. The Bwiti people, tribal gentlemen from the Cameroon. They call it Iboga. - Iboga. - For them, it's a mark of passage to adulthood. It's like a revelation, an understanding, an epiphany. Everyone has to cross that chasm; from boy to man, from lost to found, from broken to whole. Let me help you find the bridge. Just like the old days. Understand, discover, can still come. - To my golden boy. - You kill him. - He is just a boy. - Ocean wants to send a strong message. Get rid of him. The time will arrive when we need to be stronger, so the king will fall and Taurus City will be free. - Can I trust you, my son? - How can you not? I'm your daughter's husband. - This will be your last mission. After this, it's over, I promise. - You disappeared for months and I didn't know whether you were alive or dead. Wait for me, wait for what, wait for this? - I can't explain. - You're a criminal working for my father. I look at you and I see no one. - Wait! Not anymore, not for me. - Mistakes are the portals of discovery. - No. - No! No! Come on, man, come on. No, no! - Nothing personal. The system is a chessboard, and you're just a pawn. War is a mechanism of control. Freedom is not given, you have to take it. - I have to find her. Wake up, wake up, wake up! Wake up! Wake up. - Where's The Seer? - I don't know man, but the cops are here, it's time to fucking go! Come on buddy, let's go! - Seven years ago, Johnny Ferro worked for Michael Ocean's secret Army. But he was playing a double game, and moonlighting for The Union. Michael Ocean controls all of the drug trading in the Middle East and Ferro was gonna bring the whole thing down. But before he could do that, he was given up for dead on his last mission in the Army, until tonight. - That doesn't make Marino any less dead, or Johnny Ferro any less dangerous. - Okay so now we're working on anonymous tips from across the city to round up Ferro. But for whom? - For the officer who was killed in the line of duty. I didn't think I should have to tell you that. - We are doing Michael Ocean's dirty work for him and Johnny Ferro could be the only man in this city who could bring Ocean down. - Let me explain something to you. You're a homicide detective, that's your role. I'm a supervisor, that's my role. Same thing goes on the street. There's people who push the buttons, and there are people who do the dirty work. And Ocean has his role, and he plays it very well. And there is no one in this Police Department that wants to see him go down because the alternative is blood on the streets. Apparently, Marino couldn't beat that lesson into you, so I will. Ocean is the best of a very bad set of options. - Niko. - What? - Stop! - No time, come on. - Need a ride? - Fuck yeah, let's go. - Wow! - That was out of control! - Where do you wanna go? Where do we wanna go? Away from here! It's a fucking hell, fucking pigs. - Cops are running wild tonight. They're all over the fucking city. Why? - Some crazy fuck shot one of them. Let me ask you something. Sure. Who did I get into this van with? Your brain is cooked to perfection. Did anyone get into the van with me, when you all stopped? Man, what shit are you on? Just answer the fucking question. - Wait! - Am I alone? Get your fucking hands off of her. Fuck you! - So no, you're not just a psycho, you're a dangerous psycho. Am I alone? Am I alone? No, you're in the back of a camper with a guy who got his chest caved in seven years ago. - You're dead? - Not so long as I'm remembered. Niko's dead. - So who? - Who am I? You really are fucked up, aren't you? No. - No, no, no. No. - You gotta let me go, brother. It was never your fault. People were gonna die. Them, us, it was war, it's what happens. Let me go, Uly. - No, Niko. No, no, no, no, Niko, no, no. Can't stop now. You got to keep going, man. - Fuck! Oh my God I killed him! - You didn't kill me. - Oh thank God. Wait, I'll call an ambulance. - No, don't do that. Shit. - I'll take you home. No, it's okay. - I'm not taking no for an answer. I just ran you over, I can't just leave you here. What if I don't wanna go home? - I'm Kaly, where are you from? Look, I'm sorry I run you over, okay? You ever feel like you're just drifting, drifting for so long like, you wouldn't know land if you saw it? All the time. I'm Uly. - Here it is. Okay, where is it? Ah, voila, found it. Drink? - You had to have a police squad for this guy. I don't want to hear excuses. Find him. Shut up bitch! - Uly, is that your name? - Sort of. - Why do you never answer questions directly? - Because I don't always know the answer. It was a name, from the army. Uly, like Ulysses. The man who wants to go home. What do you want with me? - You're like a book, with all the pages out of order. - Who wants a book like that? - Hey. Who are you? - Johnny. - Johnny. - I'm Johnny. ♪ Her eyes just feel ♪ ♪ Has arrived ♪ Accept your past. ♪ Her eyes is time ♪ ♪ As I cave into her eyes ♪ ♪ And the morning can be so cold ♪ ♪ Face the heat ♪ ♪ Feel the tears down to the sea ♪ ♪ Face the heat ♪ ♪ Here in the deep ♪ ♪ Down to the sea ♪ ♪ Down to the sea ♪ You know you're not well.

But if you see her, you know is over? - I know. - Time to go. Good evening, tickets, please. As we await Michael Ocean grand entrance, Europe's most distinguished business leaders and company heads take their seats. The members of the national orchestra are tuning their instruments. Maestro Claus Van Der Roost chose the Pietro Mascagni masterpiece, Cavalleria Rusticana as a symbol of the United States of Europe, you found freedom. Hawk in position. - Repeat. Where is he? Hawk, he's in the building. - Copy. - It's time to go. - Frank. - Michael. - Long time no see. - Last time I saw you, my son was still alive. - Condolences again. - Sometimes we get caught in the storm, and the wind and the waves can carry us far away. We do anything to get home, but the time we do, we will be changed. - What do you want? - Just wish you a Happy Anniversary, Michael. - What have you done? - I found you. Mamma. Mamma. - What's his name? - Nicholas. - Nico. - The horse is lame. - I came back to you. Please know that, I came back. - Johnny, Johnny! - That's it. - Johnny, why would you come back from hell? - A promise. - So now she's lost her husband and her father. Congratulations. Now she knows the truth. - The truth you thought you had, it's not real. - I don't accept that. - I treated you like a son and you betrayed me. - Freedom is not given, you have to take it. - Freedom is a chessboard on which you pawns believe that you move freely, autonomously, but it's just an illusion of scale. But in the grand scheme of things, I'm a pawn too. But on this chessboard, I'm the king. And the king down here chose to kill the horse. - It's all wrong. You hungry, Argo? Are you falling apart? - I wanna watch you all day. - Please don't go, not this time.
