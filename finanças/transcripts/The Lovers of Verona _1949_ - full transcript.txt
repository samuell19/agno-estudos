THE LOVERS OF VERONA At the end of the Byzantine Empire, glassblowers coming from Greece sought refuge in the Republic of Venice. Soon the art and industry of glassmaking enjoyed such expansion that the Council of Ten, to keep the process secret, isolated these great craftsmen in the middle of the Lagoon, on the island of Murano. Here, the precision work excludes any mechanical intervention. We can say that, on the whole, the manufacturing process has not changed since the 15th century. Unfortunately, this work has its risks. The glassblower needs powerful lungs. Nephritis, heart failure, pulmonary emphysema... If the glassblower is too old or physically weak, this is what awaits him. Glassblowers once were the lords of Venice. And like lords, they enjoyed many privileges. Nowadays, they are modest, marvelous workers who faithfully preserve tradition. Sure. The same age-old gestures and noble character, the same love of work well done. We can say that few places exist where, like here, the past still lives on. For instance... over there by the kilns, that young, bright-eyed Adonis with curly black hair. Doesn't he resemble a young Renaissance lord by Uccello or Botticelli? It's pretty. So are you. You know, he overdoes it with those diseases. We're a sturdy bunch. Right, Domini? I'm in tip-top shape too. Glassblowers, all! My father, my granddad, who lived to be 100. Know his deathbed request? A clay pipe. He died blowing soap bubbles. As sure as I'm Angelo of Murano, parents unknown... it's on my birth certificate. Mr. Raffaele... This way, Mr. Sandrini. Come, Bettina, follow the guide. There are some real museum pieces here. Happy? What a question! I meant happy in love. Not love, of course, not true love. Just love. Coming, Bettina? Bettina Verdi? Very nice. Didn't you recognize her? I'm not much on movies. She's in Venice for a film. Very nice. And the gentleman with her? Sandrini, from Milan. Sandrini... not the sewing and motorcycle maker? Very nice. The brother. He's in movies. A bit of an artist. He likes beautiful things. And pretty women. Very nice. Thank you, Mr. Raffaele. 10% for you, as usual. No, 12%. We must do away with bad habits. You like it? It's done. You liked it? It's yours. Well? Well what? Don't you know who she is? Bettina Verdi. So what? She'll be yours like all the others. Simply so. Why not? We get the picture. A desperate case. The boy's head over heels in love! Care to bet? Hear me? What do we bet? Same as usual. A small cask of Veronese wine! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Murano. At the end of the Byzantine Empire, glassblowers from Greece found refuge in Venice... Buy some flowers, sir? They're stingy today. - Flowers, sir? - Sure. Thank you. My best customer. Love is beautiful! Love? Think he keeps buying all my flowers for funerals? And now, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor... What a plague! Them and their awful grins. Not so awful. Pretty, isn't she? - Jealous? - Of every girl alive. It's been ages. How are you, Clio? How am I? - What's the matter, Clio? - Nothing. There's sadness in your eyes. That's the matter. - Well, it will be. - No kidding? Don't worry, it's not yours. - You sure? - Yes. I wish it was, though. Best not. We glassblowers aren't healthy. And the father? You know the song. For a pair of earrings For a crust of bread To feed my family Put a roof over my head I sold my sunshine In a Yankee bed And my family kicked me out. - Just to help matters. - Right. You know what you'll do? I do. Move in with me. For a few days. Then we'll see. - I'm fond of you, Clio. - Me too. You're sweet. If I had a brother I'd still love you more. Why, it's a genuine palace! Yes, it's very beautiful. A bit run down, but beautiful. That's how it is... Mr. Maglia and his family are still going through hard times. With all these treasures? Of course there are some very valuable pieces here, but for Mr. Maglia, they're all heritage. He respects tradition. What a shame. Hello, Laetitia. - Is Mr. Maglia in? - Always, as he never goes out. What a strange person. She's an excellent woman. She's been with the Maglia family for 20 years. I owe her a lot. She raised my fianc?e. You're engaged? So those wild Venetian nights are over? I won't lose in the exchange. She's delicious. The bloom of youth. And brand new. That redhead! Putting you in this rabbit hutch! And you don't protest? Come in here. Introduce your friends. - Miss Bettina Verdi. - Delighted to meet you. - Mr. Sandrini. - Delighted, sir. Madam Maglia. Bettina Verdi! The famous Bettina Verdi! Bettina Verdi here. It's a dream. Out of The Arabian Nights. Yoo-hoo! You're wanted, kitty-cat. Bitch. Mr. Raffaele and friends. A young woman. The kind of young woman you used to fancy. Get a move on, my fat rat. There'll be port and cigars. Summer in Venice is stifling. Doesn't it smell dreadful? You don't? I'm exaggerating. One must criticize. Everyone praises Venice. I simply adore Venice. What calm! It's like Bruges-la-Morte. You're looking at Georgia, my daughter. An angel! Alas, an angel who's leaving us. For whom? The dark, handsome man seen in the Tarot cards. We raise them, they leave us. That's life. As I was saying, I'd have searched the Venice and Rome antique shops in vain, as it's all here. You think you can make him decide? I'll deal with it. I'll make it worthwhile. I'll deal with it but I won't make a deal. I didn't mean that... I'd like to have some of this furniture without hiring it. That would be difficult. What would be difficult? You know Ettore can never refuse you anything. Excuse me, you sent for me, but people condemned to idleness excel in seeming busy. Sir, if I can be of assistance... but I doubt I can, sadly. I'm a man from another era. I admit that I preferred that era to the present day. Ettore, please. I'm not complaining. I'm simply stating the facts. We're going through a period... or rather, it's going through us. Never mind... A wretched, pathetic period. Forgive my bluntness. I'm not used to socializing. But I've clung to my ideas. And I've paid dearly for it. I admit, I was among the first to march on Rome. Now Rome is marching on me. And Venice as well. It's the order of things. When I was public prosecutor, people greeted me in Venice. Today people would insult me if I dared step outside. So I stay at home. In my home, I can hold my head high. Putrefaction! Putrefaction! Putrefaction everywhere! Amedeo, please! Never heard of him. No more Amedeo. No more anyone. It's all destroyed. The end. Putrefaction and nothingness. Madam, you're a charming lady, just take a look at this. A dead fish. The story of my life. And the lemon doesn't help matters. Dead and rotting. Alive with vermin! Teeming with it! Venice, too! And the whole world! Vermin is at liberty! No order, no hierarchy, no discipline! You know what I do with vermin? Up against the wall, 12 bullets in the head. Nothing to discuss. It's scientific. Amedeo. You robbed the kitchen again. I've done no harm. You're not being sensible. I only said it was dead. He's my cousin. - Forgive him. - But my dear sir... A war wound. In Tripolitania, he drank bad water, miasma, fever... The fate of today's heroes. Excuse me, Ettore, Mr. Sandrini is here. About the furniture. Everyone seems to think I'm an antique dealer. Mr. Maglia, if I brought Mr. Sandrini here... It's because I insisted. If I forced my way in, necessity drove me to it. We're in Venice to shoot a film. - A film? - And what a film, sir! "Romeo and Juliet." "Romeo and Juliet." A divine, sublime story. A real masterpiece, "Romeo and Juliet." "The Lovers of Verona." You're filming it in Venice? "The Lovers of Verona"? That takes the cake. We're only shooting the interiors here, in studio. But for all the exteriors we'll go to Verona to film on real locations. In the ruins? Poor Shakespeare! Am I to blame if Verona is in ruins? Is Shakespeare to blame for the war? That's not the question. For Mr. Sandrini's film, he's looking for rare, authentic furniture. Particularly a bed. Yes, a Renaissance bed. A graceful, otherworldly bed. A young girl's bed. Juliet's bed. Putrefaction. Decadence and putrefaction. Of course, Amedeo. Putrefaction. But why did you go out? It's forbidden when there's company. Yes, I shouldn't have, Laeti. Lieutenant Amedeo Maglia! 4 days in the brig! The grounds? Unauthorized leave. And shameful behavior in the house! Where I'm given hospitality. Putrefaction. They give me hospitality. And what do I give in return? Nothing! So they keep me locked up. Come now, Amedeo, calm down. They're all against me, Laetitia. I've had enough. As they're all against me, I'll stand them up against the wall. They'll dig their own graves. And I'll shoot them down at random! That's a sharpshooter talking. You hear me, Laetitia? Say it! Come along! Now then! Put that down! Remember what Mr. Maglia promised. If you behave yourself, one day you can go down into the cellar and shoot with real bullets. Promises... always promises. Meanwhile the streets are teeming with vermin. Georgia... How pretty she is. - What about me? - It's not the same. I love her. You look like a little horse with your red mane. A little horse. Hands off! My lieutenant! A little horse! A little horse. Putrefaction... Juliet's bed. Splendid. I'm truly delighted. - But embarrassed too. - Embarrassed? Why? All the same... You see, it's a young girl's bed. And soon she won't be needing it, sad to say. For us it's a pleasure, even an honor, a consolation that this virginal bed will be the most genuine ornament... Here, like this. Thank you. - You must hate us. - Why? We carry off your furniture, like bailiffs. I couldn't care less about their furniture. Look... I want to ask you a favor. A favor? I want to work. I thought you might be able to help me... Anything... Work as an extra. You know, it's not much fun. And here... I can't explain why, but I can't stay here anymore. So, Bettina, you've abandoned us? I'm coming. Come to the studio tomorrow. I'll find you something. - May I? - Of course. You should have thought of it. I'd have liked that. Thank you anyway. Break it up! No point waiting, I've told you 100 times! No more extras wanted! I said no more extras. Are you deaf? No, and I'm not an extra. Is Bettina Verdi shooting today? - Of course, but... - But what? I need to know. Know what? Never heard of Angelo de Murano? That's me. - You know Angelo de Murano? - Another daddy's boy. Easy, be careful. It's worth a small fortune. Good. This furniture is a find. Sandrini, nice work. You did well for once. Didn't I! Funnily enough, I found it all in an old palace... You could have left it there. We won't see it. Or hardly. The scene is in close-up. With Juliet at the window. And over there, Friar Laurence emerges from the shadows. Mr. Bianchini, it's vile! They want to shave my head. - It's for the tonsure. - The tonsure! I'm in "The Downhill Slope" after this. A great part, the pimp. You see? A convict with a shaven head is OK. But a pimp! A seducer! Hired killers on the left, young lords on the right! What are you? An assassin? A young lord. A Renaissance lord. Right, over there, we're wasting time. So what do I do? Put on a wig. Is the balcony ready? - Yes, but... - But what? - There's a problem. - What? - It's the ladder. - Fix it, I'm coming. Mr. Bianchini, about the wig: I see it austere, a Grey wig... Discuss it with the makeup man! - Don't work yourself up. - I'm not worked up. I'm pretending. I have more important issues than vases, ladders, pimps, friars... and wigs! Listen, Mr. Benedetti... Please. I'm not here to listen. I say my lines and play my part. Exactly. Romeo climbs the ladder to meet Juliet. Everyone knows that. What does it prove? That Romeo didn't have vertigo. But I do. I'm an actor, not an acrobat. Vertigo! What is it now? Well... What's your problem? Vertigo. Is his stand-in here? Mr. Bianchini! Don't you want to see the lords? Don't pester me with the lords! Do you have vertigo? I was Bellini's stand-in on a cliff in "The Secret of the Glacier." Oh my God! - What's wrong? - The ladder. - So what? - I just walked under it. Don't make a fuss! Impossible. If I climb I'll fall. If I fall I'll die. It's predestined. Put on his costume and do it. No! My palpitations. For heaven's sake. It's easy. - Can anyone do it? - I can. Come on. Up you go. OK. You can get down. Perfect. Get him dressed. - I'm sorry... - Don't worry. It suits me. We'll film with a wide shot. The camera there. The kid with his back to us. Juliet up above, just a white shape in the shadows. It will be very beautiful, thanks to you. You'll be his stand-in for the whole film. Tell Bettina to hurry, the boss is edgy. Me too, but I was born that way. - Is Bettina Verdi coming to Verona? - Sure, she's the star. Keep out! - It's me, Sandrini. - I haven't a stitch on! I'm not complaining. All right. I'll be back. Really, a man who would do anything for you. You'll never behave sensibly. Were you sensible? I should think so... Look at me now. That's encouraging. Come in. See you in a bit. - Who's he? - No idea. What do you think of him? Not bad, but a bit cheeky. It's a cinch. Climb up onto the balcony... - And there's Juliet. - Right. I take her in my arms. - So what do I do? - Look at her. Go on! - And Juliet? - In place. Right, let's go! Turn on the 45. On the tower. Turn on the arcs. Watch out for your eyes! Turn on the 15. The 120. Turn on the 30. Best scene in the film. The balcony, the first meeting, love at first sight. Noon? We'll never finish! What are they doing? Love at first sight. Do you believe in it? Why not? That's it. Cut! Hey, putting down roots? You're done, children. Did you enjoy it? The lights are harsh. It's magical. Hey, Bettina! Dreaming? You see, it's very simple. Remember. Lots of emotion, lots of simplicity. Juliet sees Romeo, she can't believe her eyes. Nor can he. They're both dazzled. He takes her in his arms, and they kiss, a long kiss. Let's go. Silence! Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie. And young affection gapes to be his heir; That fair for which love would die, With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair. Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitched by the charm of looks. Venice has never been so lovely. It's never been so lovely anywhere. - What's your name? - Georgia. I'm Angelo. - Do you live nearby? - On San Martino Canal. Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitched by the charm of looks. You see, Venice is always the same. Everything is the same. Nothing has changed since the war. The gondoliers, the sun, the dreams, the romance. Watch out! I've never seen him like this. Yes, on major occasions, like San Stefano Eve. Don't mention that, it was awful. Boys, this is a very delicate matter. - Delicacy... - is right up our alley. I'm interested in a young man who lives on Murano. - I just said a prayer for him. - Got it. - The Bridge of Sighs. - Very delicate, indeed. But give us details, dear. Was she charming? I'm sure she was, she's so unspoiled. All great artists are unspoiled. What luck! On reflection, you owe it all to Raffaele. Raffaele, putrefaction! Come now, Amedeo. And he wants to marry Georgia. No man living will marry you. Or if he is alive, he might as well be dead. No flowers or wreaths. Laetitia. Come along, Amedeo. Papa, you're inconsiderate. What do you expect? I'm already gaga and senile, you're asking too much of me. When do you go to Verona? Tomorrow, on the bus. On the bus. To Verona. It's true we've sunk low. But to come to this... Who would have believed it? The Prosecutor Maglia, at his table, in his own home, with his daughter of 15, who says: "Tomorrow I go to Verona." You won't go to Verona, Georgia! Why not? It's not proper. Come now, Ettore! And that's that! I find this whole movie business shocking. And when I begged in the street? - You didn't beg. - I did. I sold papers, cigarettes, stubs. Come now, Georgia! Let the child talk, my dear, she has a point. She had to work to help us out. Ettore can't go out... - Otherwise... - How dare you, you old ruin! Don't hit Papa! Otherwise, in the kisser! Shut him up. In the kisser... bang bang bang! As Amedeo says. Shut him up or else... Remember, if anyone here has the right to smash things, it's me. It's white glass. Here, Raffaele, it brings good luck. I don't need it. As I'm happy. Georgia. Never mind. I don't know what's got into her. - If you don't know, shut up. - Yes, shut up, Lucia. I'm talking! My mind is made up, irrevocably. Georgia, you won't go to Verona. To Verona? Of course, Raffaele doesn't know. Bettina Verdi is interested in Georgia. She got her a job, she's taking her to Verona. Verona! Why not Paris? The Folies Berg?re? Come, Ettore, we must talk. - I hope I won't be in the way. - You will be. Poor child. You know, Papa, I'm used to humiliations. Not you, daughter, I meant the child. What imprudence! She's young and pretty, that's unforgivable as is. But if she starts being happy they'll give her a very hard time! Poor thing! Amedeo is unbearable this evening, he's out of control. Play the piano, he can turn the pages, it'll calm his nerves. Raffaele, I don't understand you. Never mind. I've decided she will go to Verona. So she'll go. A little trip will do her good. She needs a change of air. She gets bored here. She can't breathe. She'll go wrong one day. Go wrong? My daughter? A Maglia? The Maglias are hardly an example. You think movies are better? A fine school of morality. - Fool. - What? Stupid fool. You think you never playact? Never play the clown? As, when you walk in... with dignified bearing, and tears in your eyes, to sell off your family's inherited weekly furniture. I'm not saying you act badly, on the contrary, the audience loves it. No antique dealer would look at your tawdry furniture. But on seeing your face, his heart would beat charitably and his wallet would open. Doing a good act and good business is only human. You know, Raffaele, if I agreed to play this part... It's because I'm paying you. Don't talk to me like that! You must be thirsty. That's enough. When I found you in your hole, you were starving and scared. You backed the wrong horse and lost the war. Whereas I won. Without even fighting. So all that lofty stuff, noble sentiments... We're simply puppets. Puppets, I tell you! That was all hot air as well... Show business! You've gone too far. I order you... In the name of the law? You wept for joy when I found your portrait. I understand. Something to be proud of. A fine performance. Demanding their heads all day long. In all honesty, before God and men. They were guilty. I have no qualms. Innocent. Between you and me, admit that you enjoyed it when you hit the jackpot. A nice little death sentence. Apparently it really excited you. Judging by confidential reports. Police files... Sure. Into the basket... Along with the severed heads. Still, is it true that you had an ebony box in which you kept the condemned men's last cigarettes? Enough. You rang, sir? Sir is thirsty. After everything that's happened... I'd rather... I won't accept a thing. Not even a glass of water. As you wish, my friend. I was saying: "Georgia leaves for Verona tomorrow." Isn't that so, Mr. Maglia? Laetitia, you'll go with her. As it's more proper. Well, fat rat? Thirsty? Come to my room. It'll take your mind off things. Come now, Amedeo! I like this bird. A child before Today a whore For a pair of earrings For a crust of bread To feed my family Put a roof over my head I sold my sunshine In a Yankee bed Drink up and stop crying. My fat rat. I haven't laughed so much for ages. You will with him. Absolutely, a great part. A Don Juan, a seducer. A seducer. It fits you like a glove. A velvet glove. We don't often have such a lark. We don't often do Shakespeare. Talking about larks... Last night... No, at dawn. I was with a shepherdess. A blonde... Though I prefer redheads. But when there's no choice... I can't complain, I was lucky. A woman of the world! Talk about voluptuous! A gala night. A festival! 12 curtain calls! We heard a noise. The blonde got scared, so I reassured her: "It's a skylark," I said. I was damned right too. A skylark with horns! It was her husband! You should have seen me leap. Tarzan! Onto the balcony, a regular Romeo. Can you picture it? Romeo in pajamas. But get this... Only the pajama top! And it was a bit too short! It's a skylark I'll never forget! Skylark, gentle skylark Skylark, I'll pluck you Skylark, sweet skylark Skylark, I'll pluck you There's Verona. Slowly. Slowly, please. There's no hurry. You're married now. The priest has blessed you, you're united for life. Move, you're in the field! You call this a field? The finest garden in Verona! - Who's he? - The guardian of Juliet's tomb. Please, we're working. And I'm twiddling my thumbs? If you think you're the first to film "Romeo and Juliet" on the very location, you're mistaken. I remember back in 1910... Please, sir! When movies were silent... You're in the field! In the garden! - Go away! - So be it. But I've noted that you interrupted my work just as I was about to burn Juliet's mail and scatter the ashes, according to the rules, on the River Adige. Ready, everyone! Rehearsal! Hurry up, monks! Riccardo, places. Come on, come on! You may not have noticed: Romeo's stand-in is a glassblower we saw on Murano. Is he really? How funny. But what's even funnier, apparently he's here to be with your stand-in, Raffaele's fianc?e. Why should you care? I like it. The misfortunes of others make up for my own. Why don't they start shooting? Nice work! Perfection! My respects to High Art. It's all there, the passion... My word, they're kissing for real. It's even better, a welcome change. Lovers! Honest-to-god lovers. Come. I'll show you the tomb. You children can't imagine what a gloomy bunch visitors can be. A real disaster! Here's the tomb. It's quite simple. And not all that sad. You can't imagine all the tears and long faces. I tell them Verona is Italy's most cheerful city: in vain. They come to sob and suffer. They leave letters that others read. And it results in scandal and indiscretions. Poor Juliet. When she was alive, she wouldn't have wanted it. What a strange world. Like this cloister: it was spared by air raids, so people claim it a miracle. Had there been no war at all, now that would have been a miracle. A real one. Something new, something joyful. - That must be for you. - Yes, that's it for today. Don't you think Romeo was in on the plot with Juliet? Yes. That's how the story goes. Maybe they didn't die together. Or when he saw her dead, he wanted to live. Why do you say that? If I died, maybe it would kill you. You won't answer? You don't dare say yes. - It's so silly. - What is? Death. Everyone dies. Did you love other girls before me? But I pretended to. I told them I did. - Why? - To please them. Are you saying it to please me too? With you it's different. I love you. - Who did you love before me? - No one. I'm engaged though. Engaged? To who? What does it matter? Is he young? Not old. - What does he do? - He's in business. You'd have married him? Why not? If you knew my family... The water's great, so refreshing. - Come on in. - Like this? We're alone. Turn round. Goodness me! What a sight! And here in the ruins! Who made these ruins? Did we? Well then? What a night! What a night! Skylark, I'll pluck you... Don't forget, tomorrow: the burial scene. At dawn. Here. Look at this. - Very nice. - You're not very demanding. It's blank. Blank? You know what it is? The balcony scene. - The best scene in the film. - I was so good. - What do we do? - Reshoot it. - When? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow's the burial. - And then what? I'll shoot Juliet's burial. Get it safely in the can. Load the equipment, move cast and crew to Venice. Straight onto the set and we shoot immediately. What a night! Good night, Angelo. So... Aren't you back late? Never mind, you can sleep in all morning. She's not shooting tomorrow. They're burying her tomorrow. She's dead! Were you waiting for me? Waiting for me, Georgia? Is that you, Angelo? - What do you want? - We're looking for Angelo. What for? - We're friends. We need to talk. - A private matter. Friends? I doubt it. He'd have told me if he knew Laurel and Hardy. Don't get cute, kid. Go away. Leave me alone. I don't like comics. And I'm sleepy. - So he isn't here? - Where is he? Where is he? Far away. He's in Verona, with a beautiful girl. So much for friends. Jealous? Don't you get it? The lady is expecting a baby. - And the father is in Verona. - Buying baptism almonds! Moron! Where are your manners? And be discreet, if you want him to have a mother. Don't forget, doll, you haven't seen us. We came incognito. Listen, he's not in Verona! I made it up. Sure! You made it up. Just for the sake of it. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day: It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear; Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree: Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. It was the lark, the herald of the morn. No nightingale: Look, love, What envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: Night's candles are burned out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay... and die. Go now, we'll meet at noon. Like yesterday, by the Adige. Can we come in? Yes. What is it? Bad news, Georgia. Your grandfather is dying. He's asking for you. I've come to take you back. My car's outside. You did right. What happened? He wasn't ill when I left. His heart. A sudden stroke. He only has a few hours left. He's asking for you. He's crying for you like a child... It's heartbreaking. Poor old man. He's never loved anyone, me no more than the others. But still, he was the only one in the family who was nice to me. What about me? You're different, you're not family. Not yet anyway. Forgive me, Georgia, I arrive here like a bird of ill omen. I must have awakened you from your dreams. You were sleeping, like an innocent child. All alone in your big bed. - Aren't you hungry? - Shut up. What's keeping him? You really enjoyed Verona. So deep down, you feel your grandfather picked a bad time. Poor old man. You haven't shed a tear. Why should I? He asked for me, I'm coming. I don't love him enough to be sad. Of course. You just pity him. A scrap of pity. What about me, Georgia? If I was dying and I asked for you? "Danger of death." Don't make me laugh! If we both died, Georgia, wouldn't it resolve everything? This isn't the right road. The right road... Do you know the right road? The straight and narrow? "Danger of death." And then what? You're crazy! Fun, wasn't it? How unbearable life would be if we didn't joke occasionally. It's like the old man. He's no more sick than we are. He's in fine shape actually. If he carries on like this he'll bury us all. The fun's over. Get out. Leave us alone. Are you deaf, old hag? Beat it, you hear? Beat it! Go on. Trot! Go on! You pile of rotten meat! It wasn't the old man calling. It was me. I couldn't leave you in Verona. I know everything, Georgia. Everything. What a fool I've been. I didn't even dare stroke your shoulder with my fingertips. Then I saw you. I saw you both on the balcony this morning. - Let me go. - And I saw the room. And I saw the bed... the rumpled sheets. And your happy face. - Your beautiful tired eyes. - I don't love you. What difference does that make now? I don't ask you to love me. I just want you! I'll jump! No, Georgia! Like that! No, I promise. I swear. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid for myself. I'm afraid for him, because of you. I want you to swear to me... On my mother's life. I won't touch a hair on his head. What's he up to? Stop moaning, here he is. - Out of breath? - The current. Is it deep out there? - Yes, there are weeds. - Weeds are dangerous. It's so hot. Just right for a swim. It must be very pleasant. Yes, but unwise. Sunstroke can happen very quickly. And then you go under. And where does that get you? It's easy to live a quiet life. Stay out of trouble. Keep a low profile. What happened? - Did he drown? - Caught in the weeds. Sunstroke probably. Don't move, we'll go for help. It's our little Romeo. Fancy coming to Verona to drink so much water when we have the best wine in the world here. Thanks again! I'll remember you in my prayers! It's the dying man. Feeling better? - I wasn't sick. - Don't worry, grandpa, you will be. Mind your fingers! The music's over, folks. Lieutenant Amedeo Maglia. You insulted a lady, you'll answer to me. Open fire! On my command! Putrefaction! Putrefaction! You said it, idiot! Putrefaction! The noble Maglia family's business name. Go on! Putrefaction... Little one... Putrefaction! Georgia, my little girl... What you've been telling me is simply appalling. It's beyond everything. Eat up, my old wolf, don't think about it anymore. Tell me if you missed me while I was away. I didn't forget you but I cheated on you, fat rat. With a monk too. You disgust me. Come on, don't be jealous. Jealous of a monk! Lucia, leave us. - Your place isn't here. - And yours is? No introductions are necessary. Sit down. Right. The family council is convened. Give me a drink, procuress. Whoremonger. Where's Georgia? In her room. In her room. Singing away. That trip to Verona... I've never seen her so joyful. So joyful. You weren't straight with me, Maglia. You neither, Lucia. You gave me your word. I paid it all in advance. You didn't respect our deal. - Look here... - Paid it all! You're thieves. I'm taking it all back! Everything here is mine! The sheets, carpets, walls... the clothes on your backs. It's all mine! To the last toothpick. This broken comb. All mine. It's my property. I pulled you out of the mud. Raffaele, you've gone too far. I won't tolerate... I said mud to be polite. I'm not like you. Whatever you may think, I have morals. You haven't a grain of morality. In the old days, respectable people who couldn't afford a dowry offered their daughter's virginity instead. In good families, it was even called "a little capital". Whereas now, all you have to offer me is a little tramp, a prostitute. Vile! Did you hear, Ettore? Ettore heard all right. He's in on it. Sweet Laetitia keeps nothing from him. Bravo, you raised your daughter so well. What a success. She has it off, like all the others. And who with? A layabout, a glassblower, a lung-spitter. That's enough! Mind what you say. You enjoy humiliating us. Ettore, your blood pressure. Don't worry, Lucia. It's just a courtroom effect. The Procurer has stood up, now he'll sit down. Won't he? My little Georgia... Come now, Ettore, pull yourself together. Georgia... And for her, I lit a candle in every church in Venice. God knows how many churches there are in Venice. My little Georgia. Of course... I know what you think in your heart, Maglia. I should have eliminated that young man. Great minds think alike. I got there first, old beast. I tried to. - Several times. - How ghastly! Don't worry, dear soul. I failed. Fate is against me. She seems to bring him luck. But I love Georgia. I've never stopped loving her. What do you know about love, you wretches? Yes, wretches. And I'm a loser, howling for love in front of mangy dogs. Well, I want Georgia. I'll wipe the slate. And take her just as she is, second hand, used and cracked. So there. I count on you to make her see sense. I'll come back tomorrow, or tonight, I don't know, and take her with me. If she refuses? If she says no? If she says no! You Maglias will be laughing. Out on the street, stark naked! The whole family! But you won't be on the street for long. Remember, I've kept some nice documents. Vile blackmail. They're hidden away in yellowing files. Procurer Maglia's dirty linen. And if I open the basket, what an inundation! You can make big speeches, swagger, show your indignation, hold your head high, but it will still drop into the basket. Into the basket! Come. Darling, don't upset your father like this. Listen, Georgia, I'm your mother, but I'm a woman, I understand about love. We only want you to say yes, to play for time. Afterwards you'll find a way not to be too unhappy. Heavens, Georgia! You must admit that Raffaele is being very tactful. Why should I marry him when I love someone else? She dares boast about it. Open the door! That's an order! Slowly, please. There's no rush. You're married now. The priest has blessed you, you're united for life. Open the door! Very well. As you like being locked up, you will be, until you come of age. In a reform school. That's my decision. Why do you say that? You locked yourself in this sinister house. Stubborn as a mule. We're not getting anywhere. One solution: resort to drastic measures. Come on. Drastic measures. A man like me won't hesitate. I'm a Maglia! A loner, a wild boar. A wild boar charges when he's attacked. The honor of the Maglias is at stake, as well as mine. The whole world's honor is threatened. This boil must be lanced. Please calm down, dear. Calm down? Were you calm when you were eaten by bedbugs and starving to death? Would you be calm if it all started again? Look, my dear, this is a crucial moment. Leave us, please. I need to be calm. Totally, in all honesty. That's not a clich?, not empty words. Yes, in all honesty, to save us from collapse, from disaster. It's the only way. Of course, old wolf, but remember they love each other. Oh, please! If he dies, she might die. Lovers are so silly. It's unlikely. Such cases are rare. You'll never understand about love, fat rat. I disgust you, and deep down, you disgust me. So for her it's simple: she must be disgusted by him. You hear me, fat rat? She must be disappointed. She must despise him, that way... even if he dies... it won't kill her. If I was the richest harlot in Venice Where you and all the others Would kiss my hands Hello, Clio. Have a good trip? Was Verona beautiful? Very. I was worried, you know. Last night two men came. I've seen them. - Nothing important. - Really? They didn't harm you? No one came this afternoon? - What's wrong? - Nothing. Don't you like it here? No, being here alone without you is sad. And when you are here it's impossible. Why? I'm not your sister. Clio... Clio! She's not much, of course. I must go to the workshop. I lost my bet. When the wine is drawn we must drink it. Tell me if anyone comes. "Anyone"? A girl? You love her, of course. You don't know how much. I never thought it was possible. Excuse me... What do you want? Does Angelo live here? Yes, why? He's not in? He's in the movies now. He gets about. To Verona. I know. - Were you there with him? - Yes. Is Angelo your brother? Sure. He'd have told me if he had a sister. He isn't back yet? You're worried? Everyone's back but him. If you see him, tell him I'll be on the set. We're shooting all night. Here. His call sheet. Don't worry, I'll give him the message. You came with a suitcase to give him this? We thought Angelo had gone off to Hollywood. And here he is! Looking sheepish with his wine vat! Anyone come looking for me today? Yes, Bettina. Bettina Verdi. Angelo, for you! Who is it? A woman! Yes, a lady. Bettina, of course! Bettina, Bettina! Give us a break! Nice and easy with Bettina! On a bed of roses. I reckon it's Bettina who paid for the round! - When should I come? - At nightfall. They go to bed early. She'll flash the light, she's on the first floor. Climb in through the window and I'll skedaddle. Then it's up to you. How did they find out? They were tough! But she stood firm. You should have seen her. So they locked her in. Locked her in? So what? She's waiting for you. Thanks, but... - I thought... - I was against you? My child, I was young too. I was loved and in love. So I know about love. Clio! Have supper with me? To hear that under my roof! What derision. She's not here. But her father is. And her mother. And her poor old grandfather. What is it? The whole insulted family! Dishonored! By who? My poor friend... By that. Unthinkable. A defenseless child, innocent of life's ways. How dare you? And he smiles. Should we cry? What's behind this farce? When you find a fox in the henhouse, you kill it with a spade. It's dead simple. Ettore, you scare me. There's no Ettore here. There's only the Procurer Maglia, serenely executing measures for public security. No more joking. You're going to tell us you love her? None of your business. It's between her and me. I want to see her. - She's not here. - Yes, she is. You locked her in. Locked her in? As if we were the kind to lock in our child! Do you know this individual? I saw him in Verona. And on Murano? You never came to Murano? Never. What's he doing here? What's he doing? He's a petty thief. We caught him red-handed. What was that? A thief? Calm down. Don't move. No, not Amedeo! How about that! The mounted police. Get rid of him, Laetitia! But he's as good as gold. Putrefaction! Gently, Amedeo. Gently, my little poney. I see why she was sad about her family. Let's end this. In the old days, I'd have shot you down like a dog. To general approval. But back then, the world was the world. And family honor stood for something. Nowadays... a young girl's purity, a mother's grief, a promise, an engagement, marriage... it's all rubbish. If I did that now I'd be a laughing stock. Well, I'd have problems. Whereas, if I shoot a thief in my house at night, I'll be respected by all the good people who care about their money. As that's all that matters today: money. Let me summarize. You knew our daughter had left home with a suitcase. What are you saying? The truth. Georgia is waiting for you on the set to leave with you. She must be crazed with worry by now. Gently, Amedeo. Gently. She told you there were works of art here, very valuable objects, and that's the main reason for your passion for her. She won't be happy to hear it. But it will be a lesson. - Georgia will never believe it. - She will! Everyone will, as we'll have evidence! You broke in through this window. You smashed the pane. My wife was worrying about her daughter and couldn't sleep. She woke me up and said... What did she say? "Ettore, did you hear that?" - "There's someone here!" - "Someone here?" - "They smashed a window!" - "A window?" I jumped up, pulled on my dressing gown, and in the corridor, I bumped into my father-in-law. And he said to me... Leave me alone, I'm sleepy. He'd been woken up suddenly too, and he said... And he said... "I heard a noise, Ettore. Someone's in your study." I walked straight in, I turned on the light... Here. And found myself confronting a guttersnipe, in a garden variety crime. Scum! They want to take over. I realized it was a burglary, a common crime. Don't move! I grabbed this valuable vase and threw it at him. Hands up! He ducked and pulled a gun from his pocket. Here it is. So I found myself undeniably in a situation of self-defense. And... You beat me to death. You child... Later, when it's done. Putrefaction! Amedeo, don't shoot! Don't scream like that, it's ridiculous. It's all right, all the doors are locked. Georgia... Be sensible. I've been looking for you. Angelo isn't here. Who'll get yelled at? I will. Mind your eyes! What a profession! - I'm sorry. - No, I understand. You're worried? How marvelous to be worried. I'd like to be in your place. Hurry. Go and wait for him. I'll stand in for you, for once. Ready? What's wrong? You're pale. Terribly pale. Were you running? But not fast enough. What happened to you? Nothing. I met some bad people and they didn't like me. - But you're bleeding, Angelo. - A lot. Don't look down. - Don't move, darling. - Stay here. - You're mad. - Don't go, Georgia. I can't leave you like this. Let me go! And there's no one here. No one. Just the two of us. It's good. Better this way. - Let me go for a... - A doctor? Why not a priest? Friar Laurence... who married us in Verona. Kiss me, Georgia. Verona was beautiful. Yes, it was beautiful. We were happy in Verona. Very happy. Don't cry, Georgia. We're very lucky. As we're here together. The two of us. Georgia, are you there? Speak to me. I love you. Speak to me, Georgia. I love you, Angelo. I can't hear you. I can't hear you anymore. They killed you, Angelo. Because you loved me. Because I loved you. What did they gain from it? What, Angelo? What? Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitched by the charm of looks.
