BASED ON A TRUE STORY NETFLIX PRESENTS [crowd clamoring] [metal clanging] [indistinct chatter] Maestro, what an honor! Guys, go and make the man a coffee! - He must be tired. - Is that him? - [man] Gimme your bag. - That's okay. Whatever you need, I've got you. I have a nephew who's a musical genius. He's amazing. Come to me. I'll get it for you, all right? [man] Hey, hey, hey, come on. - [man 2] Just trying to ask a question. - [man] There's plenty of time. Maestro! Have a seat, Maestro. Come over here. Right there. We are at your disposal. This is your bed, see? This one above is comfortable and airy, but you need to climb every night. And look up there. There's mold and rubble that falls on your head. And that one is more comfortable, but it's also the most cramped. You decide. It's up to you. Which do you prefer? [footsteps approaching] - Wake up, kid. - [door closes] Come on! Wake up! Now tell me, are you the kid they say you are? It depends. I, uh... Listen, are you Mixed by Erry or not? - Yes. - All right! Listen carefully. Some friends of Angelo, your brother, gave me a message for you. He says not to worry. The cash is currently being buried at a job site, and then tomorrow they're gonna cover it with cement for two tennis courts, so when the lease expires on the tennis courts in ten years, you make a little offer, you purchase the land, and you're reunited with your wealth. - Hey, kid, you understand or not? - Yes. Yes. In... In ten years, we'll be rich again. Now I have question for you. Twenty years I've been here, and I don't know what's been going on on the outside, but for you to have that kind of cash, my God, who are you? [rock music plays] Yeah.

If you're going uphill, you can shift into gear, and you won't get tired. - The pedals are lighter. - Can I take it for a spin? Are you crazy? You know what this cost? You'll fall and break it. - Just a short one! - No way! - How do the pedals get lighter? - I just told you. - You have to put it into gear. - [Marisa] Peppe! Angelo! It's time to make the tea. - Your father called. - Come on. I know it's the gears, but how do they actually make the bike lighter? Come on! Five more minutes! Boys, don't make me come down there! Where's Enrico? I don't know. Probably at the store like he always is, Mom. Then go get him! Come on now! Move it! I told you if you put it into gear, it gets lighter. Yes, I get you put it into gear, but you... Never mind. You don't know. Just forget it. - We need to go get Enrico. - Hey, wait. Why is your brother always there? Is he... a bit retarded?

Pasquale, when did you leave this morning? I didn't hear you go. - At 4:30. - Jesus! How come so early? Because I want to be in Piazza Garibaldi when the midday train arrives from Milan. - You know, it's the best one. - Listen. - This morning, Don Salvatore, the grocer... - Yeah? In front of everyone, he said we've been neglecting to pay our grocery tab for more than two months. - It was embarrassing, Pasquale. - Oh my God! Just tell him we'll pay him. Look. I have 50 empty bottles. We'll fill them, sell them, and then we'll pay Don Salvatore. He's an asshole, Don Salvatore! Okay, let me see the tea. Let's go! Okay, what is this? That one's much too dark. Add water. This one's perfect. Who made it? - I did! - No, that's not true. I did. - What? No, he didn't! - Wait. Don't fight. You both did good. For now, just bottle only the lighter one, 'cause I have to go. - Dad, please can we go with you to work? - Yeah, we'll help you like last time. [Angelo] Come on, Dad. Mom, please? Just say yes! All right. Be good. - Come on then, boys! - [boys] Yes! Let's go. Let's pack these boxes. The train is leaving soon. Move! Move! [bottles rattle] - Um, hey, Dad? - [Pasquale] Yes? How poor are we really? Peppe, what do you say that for? I mean why is this question on your mind? Are we poor in what way? Well, Aniello's dad got him an awesome present. - A bike with a gearbox. - Is that true? They've invented a bicycle with a gearbox? Aniello's dad got him a bicycle with gears on it? Yeah, Dad. When you shift into first gear going uphill, it gets lighter. When it goes uphill, it gets lighter? How is that possible? You put it in first gear, and it gets smoother... I'm not gonna ask for it for my birthday. We can't afford it anyway because we're too poor, right? Peppe, what on earth is going on? First of all, we aren't poor. If I'm not mistaken, I put food on our table every day. Isn't that true? - We eat a good meal every night. - Yes, Dad. Okay, let me remind you of something else. How do you think Aniello's father is earning all that money he makes? He works for Don Michele. That's correct, and what does he do for Don Michele? Boys, listen to me, okay? Don't forget the one thing that cannot be missing in the Frattasio household besides the food on our table. Our honesty. [funky music plays] [Pasquale] Officer, maybe I'm not clear. If you go to the store, you'd get just one bottle of this. For the same price, I'd sell you a whole box. And why is it so cheap? 'Cause, Officer, let's just say that this was merchandise destined for the American market, but just yesterday, these maybe fell off the back of a truck. Ah. Ah. This is top shelf, straight from the distillery. But enough talking. Here. You want a taste? Try it. There really is nothing like tasting somethin' firsthand. There you are. Let me know what you think. Enjoy it, huh? - That's all right. - I told you. It's top quality. Just for you, I'll sell the whole box for 10,000 lire. - Okay, I'll buy the whole box. - Uh, hello, sir. - Please can I have 200 lire? - Hey! I have to call my dad. He's in the hospital in Battipaglia. What are you doing? Leave the man alone! Mind your own business! - Please! - For what? Go take a hike! Go tell somebody who cares! Go on! Please forgive me, Officer. It's constant with these kids, you know? They won't leave me alone. It'll be 10,000 lire for me. Thanks. They keep showing up and bothering customers. Unbelievable. - A pleasure doing business with you. - Thank you. - You too. - Good day, sir. Bye for now. [whistles] - Hello, Don Pasquale. - Good morning, Don Mimì. Hey! And who are these children, huh? - Do they belong to you? - Yes. They're all mine. - Sometimes I bring them to work. - I see! - Boys, say hi to Don Mimì! - [boys] Good morning, Don Mimì! What cute boys! - And may I ask their names? - The eldest, his name is Peppe. And he is the genius of our family, huh? - Tell Don Mimì what you did. - I finished fifth grade. Oh, really? So then next year you'll be going to the sixth grade, right? No, he doesn't need to be some kind of scientist. He already got the diploma. Come on. And Angelo is the youngest, but he's really headstrong. Isn't that right, my boy? - Yeah, I'm headstrong. - Ah, stubborn. And my Enrico is the one here in the middle. Erry, what do you do for fun? ♪ Relax, don't do it ♪ ♪ When you wanna go do it... ♪ - [man] Name? - [man 2] Revolver DJ. Have we met before? Possibly. I usually play at Veleno in Vomero.

Uh, no, I don't think so. I'm from Forcella, so I don't... Erry, to tell you the truth, you know, tonight is a bit intense. I'll have to figure out where I can slot you in and how things are gonna go. Hey, Scorpio! Where were you? They told me you weren't gonna be in town tonight. I even called the hotel. [dance music plays] [man] A big round of applause for DJ Pegaso! [cheering] And now it's time for someone many of you already know. From Palinuro, our next contestant, Revolver DJ! [cheering] You got this. Hey, Scorpio! Are you still drinking that melon vodka? You're gonna get drunk and play like shit. Hey, excuse me. Sorry to bother you. I wanted to know if you knew what time I'll go on so I can be ready. And, uh, what was your name again? - Uh, DJ Enrico. - Enrico. Oh, Enrico. Come here. Enrico, I can't let you play tonight. We've gone on too long, and I got this situation where I gotta get everyone out of here by two in the morning or the cops come, and then I'm in a lot of shit. Ah. Uh, so then... I'm not gonna play? It's just I've been here since five, but... sure. - Erry you have a job, right? - Yes. Yes, I, um... I work in a record store. So like a consultant for music? Uh, no, not precisely. It's just a store I've gone to since I was a kid, and 'cause I was at the shop all day, the owner, he hired me to be the cleaner. But I actually get to make mixtapes in my free time, you know, and they're really popular in my neighborhood. Yeah. Erry, I gotta be honest with you here. - Uh... - Yeah. Being a DJ is a very particular job. You need, um, a big presence, a style, an internationality, and I just don't see those things in you. Look at you. The name you chose sucks. I mean you just took your name and added D and J. No, I but was already going to change it. I'll go get a new name. [sighs] Erry, listen up. That job, the one at the store, it's a good job. Don't quit. [dance music plays] [Ferdinando] We've got this one here that's a little smaller. It's amazing. It's got the cassette deck, the radio, AM, FM. Sure, it'll cost just a bit more, but the kid only turns 18 once in his life. - So how much does this cost? - I'll make it 30,000 lire for you. And I'll put in the best mixtape for the kids. Sting, Vasco Rossi, Pino Daniele, Baglioni. I'll have Enrico do it for you. He may have a broom in his hands now, but with music, he's a true genius. [man] All right, I'll go ahead and get this for the kid. [Ferdinando] Come this afternoon. I'll have it wrapped and the tape inside. - Take care. - [man] Take care. [man speaking on TV] Erry, I'm going home for lunch. - Can I bring you anything? - No, thanks, Don Ferdinando. I'll head out in a bit. I'm just gonna finish a mixtape then go home. All right, I'll see you here at half past four. [man on TV] A retailer of fresh fruit and... [record crackles] ...for TV's Joe Carcione.

[pop music plays] SONGS FOR FRANCESCA CHOSEN BY DJ ENRICO [man on TV] "Hotel California," anyone? [inspirational music plays] - [Marisa] Erry, come and eat! - Be right there, Ma! [Peppe] Enrico! Erry! Oh! I've been waiting! - Tell me you have it? - Yes, I have it. - Did you write "for Francesca"? - Yes. - The songs by Peppino di Capri? - They're on it. - "Cuore matto"? You put that one on? - No, Peppino. "Cuore matto" didn't make the cut. - No "Cuore matto"? - No. What, are you stupid? "Cuore matto" is her favorite song. I told you! You know she doesn't wanna see me anymore. I need "Cuore matto" for when he says, "A crazy heart that still wants you, that looks only for you." Peppino, if you don't like it, don't take it. Fine! Fine! I'll take it. If she leaves me, it'll be your fault. - Yes, Peppino, it'll be my fault. - Leave me alone. I gotta fix my hair. Look at this hair! - [Marisa] Erry, your food is getting cold! - Stop yelling! Stop yelling! Erry, did you see everything happening outside? - No, Angelo. What's going on? - There are cops, helicopters. The streets are full of people. They're arresting the king. Let's go! What's there to go see? You know I'm starving! You can eat later. Ma, Enrico isn't hungry. - When did I say that? - He said he doesn't like the food. - I didn't! - Peppino, wanna come? What do I care about what's going on? Look at my hair! I knew it. I made the fatal mistake of taking a shower. [funky music plays] Do you know what's going on? What's happening over there? Where's everyone going? Can you tell me what's going on? Where is everyone headed? [man over intercom] Hello? - [woman] Over this way. - [man] Hello? Who is it? Are you there? - Oh! - [Peppe] Hey! Come down for a second. - Are you crazy? What if my father sees us? - Oh, your father's not gonna see us. Just a sec. I have to give you something. Peppe, I told you a thousand times I'm not seeing you anymore. Okay, but please just get down here. I have something important for you. [sighs] Wait there. Hold on. [helicopter whirs] [footsteps approaching] So? What now? To make up for all the times I pissed you off. - Peppe! - [chuckles] Oh! How about I give you a phone call later to see if you liked it? [helicopter whirs] [overlapping chatter] - Hey. - Oh. Oh! - Watch where you're going, asshole. - Sorry. Sorry, my ass. - Easy, tough guy! - Alfonso, you know who this is? Isn't this the idiot who cleans up at the record shop? Fuck you. I do more than that. I'm actually a DJ. Really? You're really a DJ? - You think I'm stupid? - [grunts] Get the fuck out of here, asshole. [laughs] - [woman] Francesca, who was it? - Nobody, Mama! [groans] Come on. [helicopter whirs] ["E Mò e Mò" by Peppino Di Capri plays] [Erry] This compilation is for Francesca from her beloved Peppe. [chuckles] Greetings from DJ Erry. [crowd clamoring] [Alfonso] Bitch. ["E Mò e Mò" continues] [overlapping yelling] - [Angelo] Hey, excuse me. - Who the fuck are you? [crowd gasps] [cheering] POLICE [song fades] [organ plays "Wedding March"] [priest] Brothers and sisters, we are gathered here today in the house of the Lord to unite in holy matrimony Giuseppe and Francesca. [priest 2] Let us pray. - Oh, hi. - [priest] You have come to share... Erry, hey, there. Sorry. The traffic was terrible. [priest] ...of these two. There's Angelo. - [Angelo] Did I miss anything? - [Erry] It just started. You didn't miss anything. How are you? Well, I'm terrible. What's wrong? Something unbelievable. I met Eduardo De Filippo when he came to the prison. Eduardo De Filippo came to Filangieri? Yeah, he said he wants to direct a show with the kids from juvie. I auditioned for it. He said, "Frattasio, you're a genius. We'll make great things, you and me." So, Angelo, you're in a show directed by Eduardo De Filippo? No! No. That's what's so bad. - The very first day, guess what he says. - Hmm? "Tell me. When do you get out?" I tell him, "Maestro, I will be 18 in six months." - "Then I get released." - Sure. You know what he says? "Oh, so what do I do if you get out?" "My production just loses its only protagonist, huh?" I say, "Maestro, I'm sorry I only committed attempted homicide." "I promise, next time, I'll actually kill the guy so I can do the show with you." Sure. [priest] May the Lord be in your hearts... So how are you? Well, not bad. I'm still cleaning at the store and doing those cassettes for friends in the neighborhood. Oh yeah. They told me it's going well and you're selling a lot of compilations. Word got out, and it helps bring in extra cash. - Well, it's better than nothing, right? - [woman] Sh! [priest] This is the word of the Lord. SCALES APPLIANCES BEDS SOFAS MATTRESSES BESPOKE BEDROOMS BEDS SOFAS [Ferdinando] Hey, now watch your step. Load this next. [man] You got this? [Ferdinando] No, not this one. Take the big ones out first. We'll do the other ones later. Go on. Feels weird, huh? What are you doing, Don Ferdinando? They made me a great offer, and they'll take over the store, and I get to enjoy my early retirement. I didn't tell you because I didn't wanna jinx it. Where will I go? Erry, of all the people who've passed through here, only one had real talent, and that was you. - You're never gonna have a problem. - I don't know, Don Ferdinando. All I know is I really needed this job cleaning the store here. Hey, come on. Why don't you take all these records. They can be your uh, uh... my parting gift to you to go follow your passion. No, Don Ferdinando. I would love to be a DJ, but I don't... I don't think I'm cut out for it. I'm just not like those other guys. - I don't have style, internationality. - What's internationality? Maybe you don't have to do everything their way, huh? Come on. Listen to me. Start your own business, and move on. Erry, you know that a DJ can be born in Forcella too. [sentimental music plays] [sighs] - [indistinct chatter] - [boat horn blares] [man] Yeah, pull up over here. Right here. All right, listen here. No trouble today, huh? Everyone's gonna get the cartons they're owed from this shipment. I don't want any trouble. - Guys, I don't want any trouble. - Mohammed, please stop pushing, man! Come on. Don't stand so close. You have to respect the order of arrival. I've gotta load up this week. I have three kids. You know I need it. And I don't? Think I'm here for fun? I like coming to the harbor at four in the morning and standing here freezing. I don't understand how every time I see you, there's another kid. - The last one was born last week. - Okay, whatever, just stay there. [man] Hey. Whoa! Hey, you, watch it back there! [crowd clamoring] [horn beeps] [man] Leave it! Leave it! Run! [clamoring] [sirens blaring] [suspenseful music plays] Did it happen again? Well, someone's decided that smuggling cigarettes is finished. The next load's on Monday. Guess I'm gonna have to go earlier. Oh. Why are you here? Why aren't you at the shop? Erry, we can't do it. It's one thing for extra cash. It's another for your livelihood. There's a reason why nobody's done this before. Yeah, but my compilations are good. They're in demand, and I can't fulfill all the orders I get. And plus, we have all these records that we could easily copy. Sure, and do you know why you can't just easily fulfill all of your orders? How many cassettes can you finish in a day? It takes me an hour to copy one hour of music. - Okay. - That's one per hour for each stereo. Okay, so even if we bought two, three, four, let's say five stereos, then maybe we only slept five hours a night, how many tapes could we actually make? - 50 a day, max. - Right. It's only 50 to 60,000 net lire a day, Erry. Minus expenses, divided by two. Erry, it can't be done. [scoffs] [sighs] Sorry, but isn't there a faster way to make the cassettes? What do you suggest, Francesca? I mean, people have gone up to the moon and back and, like, uh, you know, some kind of machine that can record cassettes any faster? You think? [action music plays] Whoa! So apparently, okay, they have these new television sets where you press this key, and then you get these pages like in a magazine. Yeah, it's called Teletext, but right now I think it's just an experiment. How do you know? It's written in this one too. Anyway, there's nothing here. Don Alfredo, sorry, but I have to say this. The quality of your products is quite terrible. Hey, listen, kid. What does this look like, a library? If you wanna read the magazines, you have to pay. You really want me to pay for 20 magazines without checking to see if they've even got what I'm interested in? Give me that one over there, Electronics and Computers. - [Alfredo] This one? - [Peppe] Yes. [Erry] Guys, I found it. Duplicator by Graff. It duplicates a one-hour tape in only two minutes. Wait, really? This changes everything! [Francesca] Let me see. And it says the quality is professional. I mean, look. Did I not tell you guys? How could it be possible that, in the age of televideo, there wouldn't be the exact thing you... Mm, uh... Erry, come on. Are you crazy? This thing cost 7 million. And that changes everything again. We don't have the money to rent the shop, let alone 7 million to buy this thing. Erry, I told you this isn't realistic. It just can't be done. I suppose... maybe we could ask for a favor from a friend of the family. [indistinct chatter] - Don Mario, they're here. - Oh. Good evening, Don Mario. Good evening. So, Don Mario, we'll keep this brief. My brother and I, Enrico, here, we thought, since he's been in the discography business for many years now, which, as you know, is on the rise. How much do you need from me? Eight million lire, Don Mario. More specifically, it's seven million for a duplicator, a tool we've seen that's essential for the profession, and an additional million to rent a store. And do you know the conditions of the loan? I'm sure we can imagine, um... But since we're here, if you could tell us again, just to refresh our memory. For eight million, after one month, you have to pay me back nine. After two, 12. And after three, 15. After four, zero. The debt you owe is canceled and you no longer have to repay me. Ah. Mm. - Go away. - Yes, yes, yes. ERRY RECORD SHOP So, guys, what did we say? Madonna, Bennato, and Vasco Rossi, right? - It's 15,000 lire. Thanks! - [man] Yeah, thanks. [man 2] How much longer for Battisti? Oh, just another minute. Enrico, how long will it take for Battisti? - Hi. Listen. - Hi. I already bought "Tainted Love" from you, the one by Gloria Jones, and I wanna know if you have the one by Soft Cell. And what about New Romantics? What do you recommend? Uh, okay. So in regards to, um, the first thing you said, that, uh... yeah, that shouldn't be a problem. And as for the second one... "Avalon" by Roxy Music. "Avalon"? What kind of suggestion is "Avalon"? "True" by Spandau Ballet, then. Oh, I bet you'll say "Rio" by Duran Duran. - "Forever Young" by Alphaville. - Not "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me" by Culture Club? "Vienna," Ultravox. - "Too Shy," then. - All right, then you asked for it. "Mad World," Tears For Fears. I don't know that one. You don't know it because it's somewhere between New Romantic and New Wave, and I'm confident that if you like New Romantic songs, you'll also like some new wave. If you want, I'll put that song at the end, and you can listen to it. [inhales] But if I don't like it, you're gonna make me a new tape. [Peppe] My God, what a pain in the ass she is. Erry, get on with it. It's one hell of a day. [man 2] Battisti! Oh! Battisti, yeah, I'm on it! You got it. That's right. Battisti. Looking. I'm looking. [Erry] Each LP we duplicate runs about 45 minutes, right? And if the tapes we have are one hour, as in 60 minutes, we've got about 15 minutes left, right? No, Erry, please don't confuse us. When you say 35, 45, 15 while I'm counting, I lose track! No, Peppino. Concentrate. This is very important here. So with those 15 free minutes per tape, we can fill them with a selection of music from DJ Erry. You're the DJ, Erry. Put whatever you like on there. No, see, that's the point. The selection is not made based on what I like, but what the consumer will like. How do you know what the consumers will actually like? If you buy Duran Duran, I'm sure that, even if you don't know them, you'll also like Spandau Ballet. Just like if you listen to Joe Cocker, you'll also like Zucchero. If you like the New Romantics, you're gonna like new wave. I'll add them at the end so you can check it out, and then I'm sure you'll come and buy the music of Joe Cocker. We get even more music out there, and we make more money. Erry, you've completely lost me, but there's nine million here. And four million here. - Nine plus four? - Thirteen. - What? - Thirteen million. Minus the expenses and the money we owe Don Mario, each of us ends up with a million. God, that's a lot of cash. [chuckles] What, Erry? Aren't you excited? No, I mean, in the end, we're just selling cassettes to our friends in the neighborhood. Who else do you wanna sell these tapes to? I don't know. Others, you know, like from other towns or cities. - And maybe other regions too. - Erry, are you dumb? But listen, Peppino, if we've sold all these tapes in just 15 days, imagine if we were actually organized. More organized than this? How would we sell cassettes in that quantity? To the stores? To market stalls? Hey, I mean, that's a good idea. I hadn't thought about that. Erry, mm, no, that's crazy. You'd need to have some kind of a... a... a system, a huge network that... that as a matter of fact we do, uh... have that. [funky music plays] Guys, let's be honest, everything has a beginning and an end. The cigarette market, that's in the past now. But today, I wanna talk to you about the future. The future's in a cassette? Not one, but in many cassettes. - How much are you making off of a carton? - One-fifty a pack, maybe 1,000 a carton. And we're risking going to jail for 1,000 lire? We'll sell these cassettes to you for 2,500 lire. You resell them for 5,000. Not five more, not five less. I'll take as many as you want. Zero risks. Then we get rich as hell, and so do you. Do you, uh, want to count it, Don Mario? I already did. Uh, so, Don Mario, we, um... my brother and I, Enrico, of course, we kind of wanted to step up our, uh, operations, because, in our own small way, even though the business is actually... How much do you guys need? Two hundred million. Two hundred million? Actually, 210 to be exact. That is, of course, unless you would rather have a round number. I have to tell you the truth, guys. The prices depend on the quantity of the cassettes that you buy. The minimum is 10,000 units. If you want anything less than that, you can go buy 'em at the store. - All right. - Well, all right what? How many of these do you want? The whole thing. Guys, I don't have time to waste. What do you want, 10,000, 15? Yeah, but we don't need ten or 15 thousand.

Erry, you asked me two minutes ago. If two minutes ago it was 9:05, now it's probably 9:07. Are you sure they understood our instructions? Yes, we fucking told them more than 50 times. How could these goddamn smugglers not understand? Well, maybe they just hit a little traffic. What traffic? Do you think any of these guys actually have a car? No, I'm telling you, they all just forgot because they're totally unreliable. That's all. [mysterious music plays] Do either of you know who I am? [both] Uh... [woman] Hello, this is the trauma-orthopedic center. How can I help you? - Uh, hi. Yes, um... - [woman] Hello? Yes, um, I'm Enrico. [woman] And? What can I do for you? [Erry] I don't... I don't know. Maybe I need to talk to somebody that I know there? [woman] What is this, a prank call? Look, I don't have time for this. We've got a bunch of Moroccans beaten half to death who've just arrived. - What do you... - [line beeping] [suspenseful music plays] You owe me ten million lire for all of the damage that you've caused. And shut this shithole down. [Angelo] Good morning. Good morning! Hey, you guys! I'm finally out of there! Why the long faces? [Angelo] What is it, little one? Isn't Uncle playing nice? Well, lucky for you, she takes after me. That's the best-case scenario. Angelo, since today's your special day, Mama went ahead and made your favorite dish. - Salted cod. - That's amazing. You shouldn't have! - [Marisa] You haven't had it in forever. - [Angelo] Don't mind if I do. - Something else, Erry? - No, Ma, I got no appetite. - [Marisa] Peppe, what about you? - No, my stomach's in a knot, Mom. I can make you something else. Soup? A little of meat with some olive oil? - Boys, is everything all right? - Mom, you worry too much! You don't have to interrogate us just because we're not eating. - We're not hungry. That's all. - All right. Give me your plates. Mm, no, leave it, Mom. Just in case, if I still want a bit more to eat. [Francesca] Let me give you a hand. No, no, you have the baby. You just sit down. All right then, what happened? Nothing, Dad. Nothing happened at all. Just highs and lows at work. Mm. And just how low are these lows? Well, Father, uh, what do you want me to say? For one, there's a boss for the Moroccan Mafia, who, in one night, by himself, sent a dozen of his compatriots to the hospital because they dared to do business with us. If we don't close the shop and give him ten million, he's going to kill us. But all things considered, that problem is secondary. The thing that really makes me lose my appetite is that if we don't sell 80,000 tapes within a month, and we don't return the 200 million to Don Mario, there will be no more Frattasios left on the face of the Earth. - [Pasquale] Ah. - That's it. Are those lows low enough, Papa? - [Pasquale] Angelo. - Hmm? - [Pasquale] What do you think? - About what? About what? The bastard who's threatening them. What's your opinion? Oh yeah, sure. Well, it could be resolved, right? If you go there and explain yourself properly. Politely, of course, but firmly. I think you guys can, uh, solve the whole situation, no? And also, come on, guys. Honestly, if you are not gonna eat this pasta with potatoes, I will. It'd be a sin to waste. [synth-pop music plays] [tires squeal] Angelo, you sure you guys aren't gonna need any more equipment tonight? Look, if you want, we could also drive you there. Francesco told us you were like a brother to him in prison. No thanks. Better not. We only need to have a friendly conversation. There was a little misunderstanding, and we just need some stage props. It's only for one evening. Tomorrow I'll bring it all back. Angelo, here. I've put in the bare minimum. Tell me if you want anything else, huh? What's this you guys are making? [man] You like it, don't you? We're getting ready for New Year's Eve. That there's a half a kilo of TNT on a 30-second fuse. Like an atomic bomb, huh? All it needs is a name. Something important sounding, something impressive. How many of these do you guys got? [man on TV] ...the choreography and a beautiful choreographer! How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? [laughing] My dear friends, all's well that ends... [sighs] [metal clanging] [dog barking in distance] What the fuck do you think you're doing? Well, basically, we have taken down the antenna, and now we're pulling it over here with a wire. Do you two have a death wish? Death wish? No, no, no. But actually, as a matter of fact, there's more than two of us. There's three. Listen, I gotta tell you the truth. This is the greatest night of my whole life. I mean it. But, oh my God, you have to believe me when I say the thought of leaving here without firing a single bullet, it just breaks my heart, unless you decide to do something so stupid it forces me to pull the trigger. You're making a big fucking mistake. Perfect! Yeah, yeah, keep going! Just like that! Come on. Just one more word so I can shoot you in the head, and we can splatter your Moroccan brains all over. Go! Move it, all right? Come on. On your knees. Listen, I'd really like to tell you something. I know sometimes it might seem like we're naive or messed up or something like that. And hey, sometimes we are, sure. But not this time. Not this time. You have 24 hours to get out of Naples once and for all. And don't forget the Brothers Frattasio will only show forgiveness one time. [sighs] And don't forget we'll only show forgiveness one time. We'll only show forgiveness one time. Oh, whatever, I don't even know. There was this whole thing that was going to justify all my cool theatrical talk, but I guess it isn't working or... I think it got messed up. Yeah, well, no shit it did! Look how long we've been standing here. Now we look just like dumbasses. [Erry] And from that moment on, things started to get wild.

And in addition to the personal satisfaction, we also earned a little something for ourselves. Well, to be honest, much more than a little something. [game show music plays] [Erry] In the mid-1980s, in a single week, we were earning more than a normal person earns in a lifetime. [indistinct shouting] One hundred thirty!

Yes, but why do we have to do these things? Come on. Erry, for all sorts of reasons. One, the owner will pay us. Two, because you promote the brand. Three, because you're always on your own in the shop with your headphones on. - Depressing. - [Erry] What's wrong with that? [Angelo] It's sad seeing you all alone in the shop all the time, okay?

You know, I came to the store twice, and you weren't there, not you or the cassette. Yes, you're right, but it's because I don't work in the record store, uh, not anymore at least. We're kind of in other places now, so you won't find us... Well, you won't find me there, but tell me, how can I make it up to you? Why don't you tell me how a guy would make it up to a girl usually? Ah! Uh... Now that's a question. Actually, you know, I've personally been giving that a lot of thought too. - So how could a guy... - Erry, you're the best. Uh, thanks. Uh, I mean, I could make you the New Romantic tape. Right away. We can go to our laboratory. I have all of the equipment there. - The laboratory? - The laboratory.

[man 2] Salvatore, who's this kid driving around the neighborhood in a yellow Lamborghini? He's one of the Frattasio brothers, the youngest. And what do these Frattasio brothers do to drive around in a Lamborghini? Oh, you don't know them, Don Carmine? They're the guys from Mixed by Erry. The cassettes, they're on every market stall. They're getting pretty famous. [Carmine] Salvatore, go and get me one. I'm curious to hear it. [girls laughing] And these are the laboratories. Well, this is one of them.

Tomorrow we drop the compilation, ten days before it releases officially. So your Sanremo compilation actually releases first? [sighs] You have a weird way of being a DJ. In what way? Well, I... It's just, you know... Well, the music belongs to someone else, right? Yes. Yeah, I mean, that's what a DJ does, right? We take others' music and turn it into something new for everyone. Yes. Of course, but... But... I just don't know if a DJ makes all of these cassettes. Actually, I don't know how many cassettes other DJs make, but maybe I just like to DJ in my own way. You...

We have a few guests over and a few friends visiting us. We're young. We like to have fun. Erry, I'll be honest with you. You see, lately I've had to deal with quite a few problems. Between my brother in jail and these assholes at the DA and that load of ignorant, old guys who are the other families, I didn't happen to hear the latest news in the neighborhood. The great Mixed by Erry! No, no, thank you. Thank you, really. I heard that things have gotten serious for your business. You've acquired a lot of cash. You sell all over Italy. No, I wouldn't say all over. We're, uh, mostly in the south. Uh, but you know what I've been thinking? For me to earn what you earn, I have to risk three life sentences. What do you risk? Uh, the thing that I do is create the cassettes. I mean, I'm really just a... just a DJ. And how many brothers? There's three of us. From now on, there are four of us. There's me too. Okay, let's not panic. It was just an offer, and a confusing one, by the way. As for this thing about the brothers in there, Erry, three, four? Maybe we just misunderstood what he was saying. All we need to do right now is focus on the music. Worry about that. I mean look at Polygram, you know? Take Polygram, back when it merged with Philips. No one expected it, but the things they did together were incredible. Yeah, but I would bet that if Polygram refused to join up with Philips, then Philips wouldn't have killed them with a hammer and screwdriver. - What's that got to do it, Angelo? - A lot actually. I am trying to make a careful, lucid analysis of the negatives while still considering the positives. - There are no positives. - Whoa. You can't talk like that. Peppe, we agreed that our independence is most important, right? We didn't fucking do all this for the first idiot who comes along to take from us. Carmine doesn't look like the first idiot. How could you consider letting Carmine in on everything we worked for, everything we created, all the effort we put in? I'm considering it because I don't see any other realistic alternatives... [upbeat music plays] ...if any of us wanna keep on breathing. [Erry] We got out of it with a stroke of luck because the curly-haired kid had set out to change an age-old criminal system. And the old families didn't like that at all. [reporter] Three dead and one injured in the Neapolitan area yesterday. Although the deadly war, raging for the last few days, has already claimed five victims... The control of drugs and arms trafficking is at the root of the massacre in Marcianise, in which four members of the New Family were killed. [reporter 2] The carnage wrought is indicative of a brewing war. - [reporter 3] These images... - [Erry] The war broke out that very night. And we, along with our tapes, were completely forgotten. But the real trouble was just about to begin. [suspenseful music plays] Who the fuck are they? ["'O Surdato 'nnamurato" by Enrico Cannio plays] [singing in Italian] NAPOLI ITALIAN CHAMPION [crowd sings in Italian] [pager beeping] - Guys, we have to go. - What are you talking about? - The party's here! - No, the party's over. We need to turn around. - You think I can do a fucking U-turn? - I don't care. Turn the fuck around! Fuck. Peppe, beep the horn, please! - [Pasquale] Guys, excuse us! - Guys, you gotta move for us. All right, please! Get out of the way! We're coming through! [Erry] Deep down, we knew that sooner or later, that moment would come. [action music plays] This is it, guys! We've made it on the front page. Pirates. That's what they call us now, pirates. I don't understand. What do we have to do with pirates? I don't know. I kinda like the name. I think it's kinda poetic. I knew the police would show up sooner or later. You think this is poetry? Tell me. Where is the poetry in this? Do you know what a pirate looks like? They only have one eye and a silly hook instead of a hand. - What do you care? - I care. We don't know how many labs they seized, but your only concern is what name they're calling us? There's one thing I don't understand. On what grounds can they do this? Like, what can they do to us? We're not doing anything illegal. Erry, they raided three labs. You think if everything was legal, they'd be able to? You know, I think we must be in a legal grey area or something. Plus, if we broke any real laws, then they're few and far between. Well, to start out, we don't pay any taxes. We don't have receipts 'cause we have no cash register. You really think the problem here's the register? Bar Gianni's been open since the war. They never had a register. Does Gianni from Bar Gianni drive around in a Lamborghini, Erry? Do you have to keep fighting about the Lamborghini? That fucking Lamborghini! Oh, he just absolutely hates that Lamborghini! You want the truth? This is just intimidation. - They wanna scare us. - It's Captain Ricciardi. I remember him from smuggling cigarettes. He's a real fanatic about the law. He thinks he's a sheriff. Fine, but what can he do? He's just one man. Worst case, he just slows down our production. Our production cannot slow down, Angelo. They wanna wage war with us? Okay, then maybe we get ready to win the war. [energetic music plays] Plus, I'm also going to get us a register. "All eligible capital assets in the owner's possession may be conferred." "It's customary. Sincerely, signed." [Erry] We created company structures that had a semblance of legality. In one day, we founded Mixed by Erry SRL, Francesca Import, Teresa SAS, Erry Show, and TNF Services. Our companies helped to move the capital and were also the official interface for business with major clients. Ten labs were no longer enough for us. We needed twice as many. There are three apartments available in total. - If you wanna see, I can show you. - [Angelo] What's the condo fee? Obviously it depends which apartment that you choose, right? No, no. I was asking about the condo fee for the entire building. Tell the tenants nobody has to pay anymore. - We'll pay for everyone. - Oh Jesus. Why on earth would you pay for everyone? Ah! So we can avoid any questions just like that one. Also, by the way, sir, we'll take all three units. [Erry] Plus another five ready to go within an hour in case of seizure by the Financial Police.

This country's counterfeiting issue, to me, is becoming serious. Look, you can't be filming out here, please. [Erry] The operations of the Financial Police attracted the interest of journalists. - [reporter] This is an industry! - [man] Yes. We're talking about thousands of lire here. They're defrauding the state. They're infringing on copyright. Who are these pirates? They're the ones who've been stealing the music. [Erry] The term "pirate" was commonly used now. Everyone knew how lucrative and relatively low risk it was. So, within a few months, piracy increased tenfold. - What the fuck is he doing? - [parking brake clicks] [indistinct chatter] What is all this? All of these, sir, are cassettes. Look here. Look. Today we even have the latest compilation of Sanremo. Are you fucking with me? You know, Sanremo started last night. What do you want me to say, sir? If you want it, it's 5,000 lire. Five thousand lire? Yes, but the sound is perfect, huh? I can guarantee it. However, if you wanna save money... [Erry] Guess which was the most pirated label in Italy. ...we also have the fake one. What do you mean the fake one? Then what's the other one? [sighs] Well, sir. Sorry, but this one is an original fake. Four is not enough for me. You know I need at minimum seven. Seriously? Have you gone mad? Do you want my father-in-law to kill me? No, no, no. We're blowing things all out of proportion here. Come on. This is getting out of hand, and, uh... Hold on a second, Mimmo. Stay on the line, please. Ricciardi, what the hell do you want? Can't you see I'm busy? Um, I need an arrest warrant. And who do you need this arrest warrant for? For the counterfeiters of music cassettes. You want me to arrest some kids who are making mixtapes? But, sir, they make a lot of 'em. They sell 'em at the market in Naples, and they're expanding across Italy. We've raided 'em, but they won't stop. We gotta arrest 'em. They're doing it in broad daylight. So should the guys selling contraband cigarettes get the death sentence? The ones selling drugs, should we burn them alive? You don't understand, sir. This business is enormous. They come out with a compilation of Sanremo while the festival is still going on. They're being copied by other counterfeiters so they pass off as originals. Nobody can tell what's real. Let me stop you right there. Do you have any evidence of all this? I just told you the market stalls are full of these tapes! - Full! - What do I tell the magistrate? Let's take a nice walk along the beach. We buy some taralli, and along the way... Maybe I didn't make myself clear. No, Ricciardi. Do me a favor. This morning, keep out of my sight. - If you'll... - [captain] Understand? I'm currently carrying out an extremely complicated act of persuasion, and if I lose focus, I won't be able to do it. Now get out, okay? Go! Go! Mimmo, listen. I just had an idea. Tell me if you like it. I will come in person with ten patrols and shut you all down. You won't even sell a single Caffè Borghetti again. The place will be extinct. [suspenseful music plays] [engine starts] [engine revs] [tires squeal] [man] How much longer for my 500 copies of Antonello Venditti? Come on!

'Cause I wrote a love song. - [Peppe] Weren't you here yesterday? - I come every day! I wanna show him... [man 2] Sir, excuse me. I'd like to speak to Mr. Erry too. - My tape. Will you listen to it? - You wanna deliver it? - What do you think we're gonna do? - Where are the Latin American records? - Erry! - [overlapping chatter] My dream is to be a singer. I'm here every day. I have a beautiful voice. - I'll sing for you. - No! - You can't sing in here... - ♪ You are the greatest thing for me ♪ - Singers turn their hurt into songs! - Ciro, take care of this. - You're right. That is a beautiful voice. - [man] Thank you, sir. - Come upstairs. - He has a beautiful voice. Upstairs, please. Thank you. Thank you! Erry, please, for the 100th time, when you come down to the desk, you cannot talk to the singers. If they see you, they start fighting. No, Peppino, I feel for them. I do. These cassettes are the one opportunity these people get. But, Erry, we can't be music patrons to random singers. We've always dealt with big Italian names and international music. Not amateurs. Oh, and one other thing. Erry, no more flamenco music. - Flamenco? - Yes, flamenco. Your obsession with Spanish music, Erry. It just makes no sense at all. That explains all the disappearing records. No, Peppino, listen to me. First of all, it is not flamenco, but it's Latin American. Plus, secondly, Latin American music is the future. What future? Everyone sees it's in Spanish, and they don't want it. You know what we should do? How about a compilation of holy songs? - Uh, a compilation of church music? - [Peppe] Yes. I already have five, six requests from different parishes. I think it's only fair that we also meet the demands of... [silence] Who is the mole? The what now? How can your Sanremo tapes be on the shelves when the festival is still going on right now? I know there's mole at RAI. Who? I need to know. [scoffs] Tell me why I should say anything to you? [laughs] - He's funny! - [laughs] He's messing. He's messing. Look at you. [chuckles] Usually, people count to ten before they talk to me. - But I don't see you counting. - No, no. Let's not escalate the situation. First and foremost, the captain is certainly visiting us today as a private citizen, as he's without a security detail or any kind of warrant, so... Why don't we have a coffee, okay? - Ciro, go! Come on, three coffees. Go. - I'm asking you one more time. Who is the goddamn mole? You really think you can intimidate us? My whole life, I've dealt with jerks like you, bullies looking for an easy fight, who can't stand that I'm good at something. Good at what? You go around claiming to be a DJ, but the truth is you're not a DJ! You're a counterfeiter. You have no talent whatsoever! You're so mad that anyone from this town is trying to do things differently! You're only free because I can't arrest you right now, but I promise you that sooner or later, I'll throw you in jail and never let you out again! I'm gonna send three squad cars over!

They're fantastic! - All of us are big fans. - Thank you. - And you must be Peppe. A pleasure. - Pleasure. Arturo. And you're Angelo. This is Carlo Pineschi, my excellent commercial director here. Have you guys had lunch? I took the liberty of making a reservation at a fish restaurant. I know. I know. You're probably thinking Milan, fish, hmm... Allow me to change your mind. Do you have a car? - Yeah. - Follow us. The white wines are here. Ah! Tenuta Sant'Ignazio. How many bottles were made this year? [waiter] Unfortunately, this year they made less than a hundred, but we are lucky to have two of them. Well then, we'll take the both of them. This is a special occasion. Would you like to try a very interesting white wine? You might not like it. It can be a little intense, a lot of mineral. It's good. It's good. Bring it. Gentlemen, if you'll allow me, I wanna be frank with you about why I brought you here today. You may already be aware of this, but our company, as well as dealing with a number of other things, has always been extremely interested in new entrepreneurial opportunities, and I have to say, quite sincerely, that we noticed yours immediately. I'll make it short. It would be our pleasure to have the privilege to be your exclusive supplier of blank tapes. Now hold on. Before you give us your answer, me and Carlo, who I can already feel kicking me under the table for jumping the gun here... He hates it when I do this. We have come up with an offer that, to me, will be very difficult for you to say no to. Apologies, if we're talking business, we need some crudités. Dario? [Dario] Yes, sir? Bring us the cruditiés like last time? [Dario] Yes, absolutely. ["Fade to Grey" by Visage plays] ♪ Devenir gris... ♪ [Erry] That was Arturo Maria Barambani, chief executive officer of...

The good Giulio will now take you to the airport. We'll be in touch soon. So then, thanks for the beautiful company. - No, thank you, sir. - Thank you, Arturo. Thanks. Next time, you have to come visit us in Naples. Absolutely. Of course I will. - You guys go now. You have a good trip. - [Peppe] Thank you. [Arturo] Have a safe flight. Ciao. Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Don't you get it? They represent 70% of the market, and now they're with us! Tomorrow those assholes from FBC and CPT will eat their own hearts out. It's great news! Come on! Why aren't you happy? Come on, Arturo. Everyone knows what they do with those cassettes. I don't know a damn thing. Do you? Did we talk about it at lunch? We don't know anything. We didn't talk about it. And also, Carlo, what the hell? We sell blank cassettes. They're supposed to use them, aren't they? Actually, do you wanna know the honest truth? To me, for 15 billion lire a year, they could go poach all the elephants in the world. They could construct fields of landmines, enrich all of the uranium on planet earth. I don't give a shit! - Fish wasn't that great. - Hmm. But everything else went great, right? Seemed to me like we got an excellent deal. Yes, a great deal. Do you realize that with his discount, we'll increase turnover by at least 25%? - Pull over for a second. - [man] Is here okay? - Here's good. - [Peppe] What are you doing? - Erry, we'll miss the flight! Enrico! - [car horn honks] [Peppe] Enrico! [car horn honks] [tires squeal] [car horn honks] [inspirational music plays] Erry, I don't understand. Have you gone crazy or wha... Erry. - Hey. - Hey. - How did it go in Milan? - It went pretty well. I brought you a present. What's the matter, Erry? You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. We made a deal that's gonna make us a lot of money. Except it doesn't feel good? [sighs] When I look back at this whole circus, I don't know, the oysters in Milan, the commercial director, the police... I just wanted to be a DJ. Teresa, if I ever decided to stop being Mixed by Erry, would you still wanna be with me? No, Erry. No. First of all, because I'm still waiting for the New Romantic tape. And also because I really can't keep receiving such awful presents. You don't like the globe with the Duomo? Well, that's strange. I think it's quite beautiful. - Mm. - Ah! Well, I wouldn't want to ruin the... the surprise, but maybe it's because you haven't shaken it yet. Because when you do that, something happens. Everything changes. [chuckles] [calm music plays] [camera clicking] Wait just a minute, sir. Perfect. Let's get one more photo with the godfather, huh? - Sir, would you step right over here? - I'm here! I'm here! Here's the godfather! - [camera clicks] - [photographer] Thanks so much. [chuckles] Hey, that's my Enrico. Thank you again for giving me the honor of being Carmen's godfather. No! We're the ones who must thank you for everything you've done for us, Arturo. But I gotta go now. I have to be at the airport in an hour and a half. What do you mean? The fresh mozzarella from Battipaglia is coming now. - You really have to leave? - I know. I know. My dear friend, early tomorrow morning, I have a meeting, a very boring one, which I can't possibly miss, and you know we also have the record label to look after now. Every now and then, I have to show up for the whole circus, which is also very boring. Listen, before I go, though, I wanted to give you a very special present for your little Carmen. Walter! Oh my God, Arturo! You really are something! - Oh, it's beautiful! - Ah. It's, uh, an old man eating spaghetti. Ah, well, it's "A Man Eating Spaghetti." That's the proper title. It was done by a well-renowned, famous painter. The name is Guttuso. And because he died a couple years ago, the value's gonna skyrocket. I can only imagine how much you paid for this! - And it's huge! Ah! Peppino! Peppe! - Yeah? Come and see the gift Arturo got me. - Look here. Look. - Wow. - Get my stuff. - Beautiful! What is it? Is it an old man eating pasta? No! No! It's "A Man Eating Spaghetti." It's a very famous painting. Forgive him, Arturo. My brother is just a little ignorant. Well, he is a man of a certain age who is eating... What? I'm getting dessert. Keep an eye on the children. They're with your father. Well, all right, excuse me. - I have to return to Milan, Peppe. - Safe travels, Arturo. I'll talk to you on Monday about that thing we said. Girls, be good. Don't hurt Grandpa. Do you need a break from these little monsters? You serious? For once I am enjoying some time with my granddaughters. Do you wanna stay with Grandpa, yes or no? - Yeah. - See, Peppe? How about you talk to your mother? Try to reassure her. Every time she opens a newspaper, all she sees is this talk of pirates, the Financial Police, of arrests. - She worries. - How many times must we tell you? We promise there's no need to worry because there is no... Angelo, come over, and tell Dad everything's okay, would you? I'm gonna go get water for the kids. There's one Financial Police captain trying to bust our balls. But he can't because we're smarter than the guy. - I get it, but... - Uh, who are you? You're not the aunt from last time. - You're a new aunt. - Whoa! What makes you say that, honey? Those kids, they really are something, huh? Uh, come on. Let's get a drink. The girls spend all their time with their mother. They never see their father, and they shut themselves away... Oh my God, she's so pretty! She absolutely has your eyes. They'll be blue. Look. You can tell. Your lips too. No, no, in my opinion, that's Grandpa Gaetano. Well, she looks nothing like Erry. You know what she's got from Erry? That look of someone who will always be searching. [Peppe] So let me ask you a question. In your opinion... Peppe, you'll talk after me. Don't worry about it. Okay, this man, how old do you think he is? You can't ask the question like that. You're clearly giving them the answer. - What did I say, Peppe? I just asked how... - But you asked, "How old was this person?" [Erry] I was giving them the answer? How else should I have asked? To summarize, everything we've said is clear. The picture is complete. But this exclusively applies to the Anglo-Saxon market. In Italy, which is the scenario we are most interested in, the situation has features that we would be reckless not to define as catastrophic. - What are we talking about? - Piracy. - Oh, an awful thing, yeah. - Yes, indeed. A plague, a scourge. [man] To begin with, we took an example that best represents the problem. These are all the sales, divided by record company. For sensitivity purposes, we did not put the names, but there's one I do want to reveal to you. By far, the biggest column of the whole chart belongs to an entity that is named Mixed by Erry. [splutters] And they are pirates. [man 2] Pirates? With 27% of the market, they have become the leading Italian label. With peaks of 85% in southern Italy, where Mixed by Erry is perceived as original, because it is in turn pirated. [overlapping chatter] - Huh! - This is outrageous. [man] These are the sales figures for the top releases of each record label in Italy. And this is currently the best-selling Mixed by Erry tape. It is the Sanremo compilation, which is already on the market stalls with the festival still on TV. - How do they do it? - That's the question. Well, they must have a mole inside RAI. - Yes, exactly. - [man] Maybe, but we can't be sure. Or inside Sanremo itself. What's certain is that these numbers reflect an emergency, and, as such, they have been shown to the institutions, and the Ministry of Interior has allocated special funds, which are available immediately, aimed at a zero-tolerance policy... [suspenseful music plays] Where the hell are you? Come on, hey! [man] Home or to the office, sir? We're not going to either one of them. We're going to Naples. Go! Would you step on it! Go! [Erry] Suddenly everything changed. The record labels made themselves heard and the Financial Police took action. They revolutionized the force by prioritizing the fight against piracy. And they put the person who'd done the most reporting and raiding in charge of the new division. Any guess as to who it was? That's all for now. Thank you. See you soon. [doorbell rings] Arturo! What are you doing here? Enrico, I came back from Milan just to see you. - I need to speak with you. - Why didn't you just use the telephone? No, forget about the phone. I have to talk to you right now. Can I speak freely or is someone here? - No. I was actually gonna go out. - You've got to listen carefully to me. The meeting that I went to this morning, everybody was absolutely furious. - What are you saying? - The record companies! They know everything about what you do, and they wanna shut you down. You guys are the best-selling record label in all of Italy. They've already talked to the government, and they're allocating a ton of money. They want to arrest you. Do you understand what I'm saying? Hold on. Are we really the best-selling record label in all of Italy? Yes, but apart from that one thing, did you even hear a single word I said? They're already keeping tabs on all of your phones. And also, what is this thing about you having Sanremo songs before the official release? That was the last straw. That pushed them over the edge. How do you even do it? - [Erry] Well, we... - Whoa! Hold on! Don't tell me. I don't even want to know. This is it! I want you to shut everything down now. It's over, Erry. All the money that you've made over the past few years is more than enough to last your family for the next three generations. Arturo, do you honestly think that this is only about the money for us? Enrico, I'm begging. Please. There's no more time to waste. Your days are numbered here. Among other things, they're coming out with this brand-new super hi-tech stuff, and it's definitely gonna catch on. It's called a compact disc. I'm told it's a disc that gets read by some kind of laser. It's sci-fi stuff. Honestly, I didn't understand a fucking thing about it, but it's digital, and guess what? You can't copy it. Enrico, stop while you're ahead this time, please. I'm telling you this as your friend. And as a friend, I thank you. But music, you can play it, you can reproduce it, you can even digitize it, but you can never stop it. I have to run now. I have a very important appointment. I'll give you a call on the phone, okay? [Arturo sighs] Uh... Okay. Hey, Don Gaetano. Hi. - Did he call you? - No, not yet. So this thing actually gets read by a laser? Wow. Peppe, you make it sound like the lightsaber from Star Wars. It's a beam of light shooting on polycarbonate that reflects off an optical sensor. If it reflects a lot, it's one. If it reflects little, it's zero. That's why it's called "digital." Listen, Barambani came to see me. Hmm? What'd he want? He says we're the best-selling record label in all of Italy. - Wait, really? - Yeah. - [phone rings] - I got it, Gaetano. It's for me. For me. - Hello? - [Angelo] Peppe! - [Peppe] Angelo! - [Angelo] Peppe, can you hear me? [Peppe] I just hear chaos. Peppe, you have no idea how good the food is here! They've got this amazing spaghetti. They make it look transparent! It's not just the food. They're crazy advanced here. And none of it costs shit! We can talk about what you've been eating later. Have you found what we need? Yeah, like I told you, they're crazy advanced here, man. They've got this one thing, something they call, um, uh... - What's that thing called? - Uh, CLC. CLC, something like that. Can I get some of that dark sauce? Thank you. Yeah, but this thing copies CDs like a professional did it, and the blank CDs are included in the costs. Great. Buy a dozen of those, then get on a boat, and come back because in two weeks, we have to be ready for Sanremo. - [Angelo] All right. - Okay. - [sighs] - So? Is he okay? Erry, don't worry. We'll be totally fine. They're never gonna stop us. [sighs] Erry, what are you doing? Planting a decoy. [sighs] Hi, my love. So listen, honey, I was thinking, to celebrate our anniversary, since we've always just watched it at the house, this year, why don't we actually go to the festival in Sanremo? Yeah, let's go there, me and you. Oh, and, um, Peppino, Peppe, my brother, Peppe Frattasio, with Francesca, his wife. Angelo. Angelo, my brother. The other one, not Peppe. - The other one, Angelo Frattasio. - [Teresa] Is everything okay? - Why are you talking like this? - [Erry] I'm talking normal. I said we can all go there and get a nice hotel there in Sanremo, really close to the Ariston Theatre. You know, I've always talked about wanting to see it in person. [action music plays] 41ST FESTIVAL OF THE ITALIAN SONG FEBRUARY 27-28 MARCH 1-2 1991 8:00 PM The package has been delivered. I repeat, the package has been delivered. The Frattasios have arrived. We're not leaving here until we've found out who the mole inside the Sanremo Festival is. Let's trigger Operation Mike and send the Frattasio brothers to jail once and for all! - The San Carlo in Naples is nicer. - [Francesca] Yeah, it is. She's right? As if she knows what the San Carlo looks like! When were you ever at the San Carlo? [Francesca] Right, we went for your mother's birthday. [Peppe] Ariston is modern. [Angelo] Let's go, guys. It's starting soon. You go ahead. - Where are you going? - I'll be there in just a minute. [suspenseful music plays] [man] Enrico Frattasio is approaching a public telephone. He's calling the mole! Come on! Come on! Let's get on the phones. Which phone is he making the call from? [man] From a pay phone in the foyer. What the fuck? You know that there are four pay phones. I need the exact one in order for us to intercept the call. [man] He's talking to someone up there. I can't intercept the call if I don't know the exact phone that he's using! If he ends the call, I'll come and kick your ass right into the theater! [man] It should be the first one on the mezzanine floor. Come on! Who's on the mezzanine floor? Wait. What do you mean it should? - Is it the one on the mezzanine or not? - That's the one. - We're connecting to it now. - Okay, hurry up! Get it! Check the fucking number. See if it's the right one. See if it's on the list. [man] They've just announced the start of the evening. They're inviting people in. How long does it fucking take to intercept one shitty call? We've got a location. Sir, he's calling Naples. What the fuck do I care if he's calling Naples? It's a city with a million people! I need to know who exactly he's speaking to. [man] Enrico's still on the phone. I don't think he's gonna be there for long. We have the address. It's 181 Zite Street. All right, 181 Zite Street! Come on! Let's send a patrol immediately! Go on! Send two of 'em! - [man 2] I got it. We have the connection. - Perfect! You said Zite Street. 181. [man 2] He's talking to a woman. You said 181 Zite Street? Yes. Yes, he's talking to a woman now. [grunts] He's talking to his mother. [man 2] I can confirm, Captain. He is. He's wishing her a good Sanremo Festival. He called his mother's house. [sighs] PREMIUM SEATS [somber music plays] [indistinct chatter] [Peppe] Oh, really? [Erry] Hey. Sorry. Erry! Come on! Ugh. [woman] Good evening! - [man] Edwige Fenech! - [Edwige] Andrea Occhipinti! What is it? [Andrea] Dear ladies. [Edwige] Dear gentlemen. Happy anniversary. [Edwige and Andrea] The 41st Sanremo Festival... [Edwige] ...starts now! [suspenseful music plays] We seized these boxes an hour ago. They're all full of compilations from Sanremo. But it's two o'clock in the afternoon! [officer] Which means there's bound to be plenty more out there. These goddam Frattasio brothers! How do they fucking do it? - Actually, there's something even worse. - Worse than this? So they're copying compact discs too? [officer 2] Captain! - Sorry. Someone wants to see you. - Who gives a shit? Can't you see the mess we're in? We have to do an inventory of all these cassettes! How many other cases of those discs have we confiscated? It's about Mixed by Erry. [indistinct chatter] [sighs] So it's 250 million in Calabria and 200 million in Sicily. So with only Sanremo, that's two billion lire. And it's only four days. With CDs, our revenues will probably triple. Sanremo was full of undercover agents. They're furious at us now. Erry, if they get pissed off, that's their issue, not ours, you know. Why is it our problem if they took it personally? Well, Pops? What do you think? [man on radio speaks indistinctly] That I have to be in Piazza Garibaldi by 5:30 for the train coming from Milan. You know, the best one. But it's Sunday, Dad. Do you really have to go? [Peppe] Dad, this weekend alone, we made two billion lire. Can you please explain to me why you still insist on living here and selling fake whiskey in Piazza Garibaldi? Come and give me a hand. Come on. Boys! [man on radio speaking indistinctly] - [Pasquale] Erry, let's go. It's late. - [Erry] Okay. - [Pasquale] Hurry up. - I'm hurrying. Brush like this. - If you don't iron it first, how can I? - What do you mean? Brush. Wait a second. Wait. Dad, the tea is always the same. We always do what you told us! - Don't talk back to me. - [Erry] Whoa. [Peppe] Okay, I won't talk back. - I get it, I'm not talking back. - You need to add more water and shut up. This is me, I'm not talking back. - Here. See? I'm adding more water. - That's too much! Hey! How is this any different, Dad? Your bottles always end up diluted. [speaking indistinctly] [sentimental music plays] [Erry] Arturo made a deal for some sort of immunity in exchange for information about us. And he had a lot of information. From the holding-company system we bought the tapes with to the locations of a bunch of our labs. Invoices, purchase orders. Even staff management, which was obviously all off the books. - [door closes] - [keys jangle] [guard] Frattasio? Frattasio! There's a package for you from your wife. Oh, yeah. It's a suit to wear for the trial. Thank you. [man] Listen, Erry, it's very simple. Remember, this is the first hearing. They have absolutely nothing on you. So we deny everything. The cassettes, the piracy. We know nothing about it. [chuckles] Do you, um... Do you happen to know anyone who knows anything... anything having to do with the treaty in Maastricht? What are you saying? Do you know what they're deciding in Maastricht? Erry, please, listen to me. We can't lose focus. We won't have to say anything in court today. When the judge calls on us asking us how we plead, we will only say one word, right? Innocent. Erry, are you listening to me? Yes, yes. I heard you. Of course. We're going to plead innocent. [sighs] Yeah, that's right. Innocent. [judge] So let's begin. The Italian State vs. Giuseppe Frattasio, Angelo Frattasio, and Enrico Frattasio. The defendants are charged with criminal conspiracy in various aspects, which are counterfeiting, the possession and smuggling of music tapes and compact discs. Come on. All thanks to the ownership of means, premises, and equipment for the reproduction and the duplication of copyrighted material at a level that was considered to be professional. Defendant Enrico Frattasio. [sighs] [judge] How do you plead? [dramatic music plays] Frattasio, answer us. How do you plead then? Guilty or innocent? [whispers] Erry. Erry? Psst. Erry. [somber music plays] I, uh... I am a DJ. ["'O DJ (DON'T GIVE UP)" by LIBERATO plays] ENRICO, PEPPE, AND ANGELO WERE SENTENCED TO 4 YEARS AND 6 MONTHS IMPRISONMENT. THEIR ASSETS WERE CONFISCATED. AFTER THE EVENTS, THE FPM (FEDERATION AGAINST MUSIC PIRACY) WAS FOUNDED IN ITALY TO PROTECT COPYRIGHT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. TODAY ENRICO FRATTASIO MAKES AND DISTRIBUTES GIFT BOXES. OCCASIONALLY, HE CONTINUES TO PERFORM AS A DJ. THE FRATTASIO BROTHERS DUPLICATED MORE THAN 180 MILLION TAPES. Okay, Erry, listen to me here because I did something to set us up for life. I had someone take the money. We have to keep our voices down. I had it buried, and then had tennis courts built above it so that no one will move it. In ten years, the lease expires, and the land becomes available. Of course, we don't give a damn about tennis, so we go, we dig it up, and we get back all of our 30 billion. - What's the problem? - Angelo, "What's the problem?" This is the problem! Look! [indistinct chatter] MAASTRICHT TREATY SIGNED THE EURO WILL REPLACE 12 COUNTRIES' CURRENCIES Erry, this isn't a problem. This is bullshit someone wrote. Do you really think they can just change the money overnight? - No, I think it's bullshit too. - Bullshit? Please listen to me. Did you even read what it says? Erry, so what? You're gonna trust everything in the paper? You think they're gonna release a new model? We won't be able to do anything? "Too bad, you have the old money!" Come on! [overlapping chatter] ["'O DJ (Don't Give Up)" by LIBERATO plays] [singing in Neapolitan] BASED ON THE TRUE STORY OF ENRICO, GIUSEPPE, AND ANGELO FRATTASIO [song ends] [sighs] Um, hello? You okay? You hear me clear? Do you remember what you have to do? Yes, of course I remember. Just like last year. I just press the two buttons. That's all I have to do. - [Erry] Right. Enjoy Sanremo, Mom. - All right, you too. Have fun. And please be careful. - [Erry] Okay. Bye, Mom. - Okay, take care. [man on TV speaking Italian] - What did he say? - Nothing. They're all at the show tonight. I don't know why they wanted to go there. The cold weather, fancy clothes. Because they're crazy. They're always like this. Don't worry about it. [man on TV] Oh no, I'm sorry. That is not the correct... Wait a minute. There. It's starting! Hold on. Hold on. - [hosts] The 41st Sanremo Festival! - What is it? Rec and play. [Edwige] Thank you. Listen, I'm telling you. This is the last year we go through this. I'm sick of having this huge mess in the house. Yes, you're right. It's too much dust. ...every single year.
