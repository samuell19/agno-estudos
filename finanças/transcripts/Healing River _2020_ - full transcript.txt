I lied. We don't need no stinkin' mugs. - And you lied because ... - Because he wants to move out, Peter! He was gonna go look at apartments! I mean, he just graduate, for Pete's-- For your sake. What's the rush? - Life. He's 18, Ingrid. You moved out when you were 18. - Yeah, and look how I turned out. - You turned out great! And so has Michael.

We have gotta make sure that he never hurts anyone again! (knocking) - [Father Peter] Mr. Longerman. - Dave. Do we ... - Thank you for doing this. I know prosecutors have long hours. - And short lives. - My sister, Ingrid Ambelin. - [Dave] Mrs. Ambelin, I'm so sorry. - So am I! Is there any chance for death? - Uh, no. It's vehicular homicide, Mrs. Ambelin, so-- - He was stoned out of his mind! - Yes, and that will be in the charges. A DUI and driving under a suspended license is aggravated vehicular. Plus, if he has any other priors, normally I'd go for up to 20 years. - Normally? - The defendant is a juvenile. Well, he's 17. - So, what, it's a prank? Kids'll be kids? - No. But it will be handled differently. The CPS is involved. Plus, the defendant, Alec McCortland, is a foster child. So, Job and Family Services is involved. They've already assigned him a Guardian Ad Litem. - So, where's he now, at a party? - Ingrid. - No, it's okay. He's being booked into 50/50. It's juvenile detention at 5050 Reynolds Avenue. - [Ingrid] Kid jail? - [Dave] Basically, yeah. - [Ingrid] Then what? - [Dave] He'll stay there through his trial and sentencing. - Then what? - Look. He's not jut a foster kid. He's a bad egg. He bailed on his last family, stole all of their prescription painkillers, and just disappeared about a month ago. Stopped going to school, has a history of substance abuse. Rehab didn't stick. - Surprise, surprise! - If all they do is detox, all they do is retox. - So ... What happens now? - I get him tried as an adult. McCortland agreed to waive his right to an amenability hearing, so this should be pure-- (door opens) - All rise. Hamilton County Youth Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Hua-Ling Graham presiding. (bangs gavel) - Good morning. This bindover hearing is now in session. This is a closed hearing. The only persons allowed in the courtroom are those directly involved in the case. Please be seated. There are three criteria in determining whether the defendant, Alec McCortland, is to be tried as an adult: age, seriousness of offense, and prior record, which it seems I have almost nothing on. Councils, please approach the bench. Council Longerman, how did we get here without an amenability hearing? - I have a signed waiver for the accused, Your Honor. - And why wasn't this expressly stated in the record beforehand? Council Gitdmeier, I'm sorry, do you have someplace else you'd rather be? - No, Your Honor. It's just that Mr. McCortland ... he signed the waiver against my council. - Rule Three of the Ohio Rules of Juvenile Procedures says that the accused may relinquish his rights to be tried as a juvenile only with permission of the court after we have determined that the juvenile understands the consequences of that action! That's what amenability hearings are for, gentlemen! - I know, Your Honor, but it isn't required if ... Look. McCortland understands. Trust me. I mean, he may be a smart a-- He's not stupid. - Well, gosh. We have your testimony. What else do we need? And there's no legal guardian. Is that correct? - No, Your Honor. There is a Guardian ad Litem from Job and Family Services. (bangs gavel) - Excuse me! You! Guardian! Lose the phone now! - Why does the kid have to agree? Why don't they just put a robe on him? - Defense respectfully requests that Your Honor overrule Mr. McCortland's waiver, in so much as the defendant's psych eval shows that he suffers from ADD with comorbid symptoms of OCD. - Just because he watches birds and washes his hands a lot doesn't mean that he's a-- - Stop! Just stop. You both have done shotty work here, gentlemen, just plain shotty! Sit down! Now! I am enjoined by juvenile law to determine whether this young man knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to an amenability hearing. I do not find the facts compelling. - Not compelling? He murdered my son! - Ingrid, Ingrid ... - Alec McCortland will be tried as a juvenile. - You said he would be tried as an adult! - I said maybe. - No! You said that you could do it! - What does this mean now, Dave? - Well, at worst he'll be sent to DYS until he's 21. - What? Four years of summer camp? - Actually, they only send the most serious-- - Mr. Longerman. Do you need a timeout? - [Dave] My apologies, Your Honor. - Are there any adults in this room? Trial is set for one month from today. (bangs gavel) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Man On Phone] Hi, can you hear me okay? - Who is this? - Great! This is Chad from cardholder services. (slams phone) - Everything you make is so beautiful. The pottery. This place. That. - Oh, sweetie. It's not art, it's just a stencil. - That you made. Everything, the pottery, the food, Michael. - I did have a little help making Michael. You know, he ... He talked about you all the time. - I don't know how to let go of him. - Neither do I. (crying) - Need you ... to ... light up my life. Nah, nah. Total crap. Crap cliche. Need you to ... What? Need you to what? - All rise. - Alec McCortland, considering the grave circumstances of your offense, prior unsuccessful rehabilitation efforts, and your failure to respect the rules of the Hamilton County foster care system, but weighing these against time already served in detention, your abandonment as a child, and the circumstances surrounding that incident, the court is ordering a suspended sentence and treatment in lieu of incarceration. This means that your guilty plea will be suspended during your six-to-12 months residence at the Merskin Juvenile Treatment Center. If you successfully complete the program, your case will then be dismissed as not guilty. However, if you fail to complete the program, your case will be reopened, and I will recommend that, at such time, you be remanded to the Department of Youth Services for extended incarceration until the age of 25. - Well, Judge Graham crackers and milk strikes again. - So, he's the victim now! So, he gets treated for his unfortunate condition, and all is forgiven! He-- He gets dismissed as not guilty! What the hell is that? - There's gotta be something else, Dave! - If there was something I could do, Mrs. Ambelin. There were facts in the probation investigation that the defense completely mis-characterized. It make McCortland seem almost like-- - A victim! - Yes. And he's not. He's just a slick little criminal. I'm sorry. - What, that's it? Everyone else is done? - Except us. We don't get to be done! Ever! - Look, I'm telling you, he is a runner. And that security at Merskin's? What security? He'll be out in about two seconds. (gentle piano music) - The well is dry. And I'm dry. (crying softly) How can I give ... what I don't have to give? (emotional orchestral music) Okay. Long time, Ray. - Father ... I ... I fell into the gutter again, Father. And I ... drug Alisha and the kids with me. I ... I hit Gray when he poured out my booze, 'cause I'm a worthless piece of shit. - No! What you did was wrong, Ray. But you have to remember who you are. Remember whose you are. We both do. - Gray said he'd forgive me, but ... that just makes it worse. I'm unfixable, Father. Why do you even-- - No, you're not, Ray. God hasn't given up on you, and neither have I. - But I can't do it. I ain't got it in me. - Then let Him do it in you. Tomorrow night, in the parish center. Go on. Alisha can attend Al-Anon at the same time. (sighs) - Nah, nah. She ggve up on me. - What's the number, Ray? I'll call her. You do know you're crazy, right? That ... That is crazy. But I wouldn't be here if you weren't. So whatever you're doing ... I'm in. (cell phone ringing) Ingrid? I tried to call you five times! Why didn't you call me-- - I'm not the enemy here, Peter. Why should I die? (Peter stutters) - Who said you were gonna die? - No one is gonna fix us! We have got to fix ourselves! - Now, what are you talking about? Who's "we"? - You and me, and the survivor support group that we are gonna start at Our Lady of Grace. Next week, Tuesday, Wednesday, take your pick. - Ingrid. I don't think that would be appropriate. - Peter, please. We need to do something! I mean, I need to do something! Please! (gentle piano music) - [Man] I prayed my family wouldn't show up. - Exactly, Arjun. I mean, your restaurant, it's not just a building. It's a part of you. Breaking and entering? I mean, hell, try rape! - [Arjun] I agree. - This is Rose Harken, everyone. (overlapping greetings) Now, Rose is-- - Family. Now, honey, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but he was sentenced as a juvenile. You're a juvenile. What do you think should have happened to Michael's killer? - Perhaps we should focus on-- - I think Michael should still be alive, and he should be dead! But he's not! So I think he should be made to regret what he did for the rest of his life! That's the only way I'm ever gonna sleep again! (clapping) - Sorry, guys. What the hell, Peter? You said we were gonna go until 8:30! - You said survivor support group, Ingrid. Support group! - [Ingrid] Exactly! - That's not what this was! This was ... You don't heal wounds by poking them. - Oh, so Catholic denial, that's your solution? - Just Us, justice, is that what you want? - Yes! - Justice without mercy is revenge! God doesn't want that! - That-- - Well it's what I want! It's what I want, Peter! And it's what a hell of a lot of people want, too! It's what I need! I need to do something! I need to take action! Do you know, last week, I almost-- - Honey, honey, it's okay. It's not taking action to rage over something you cannot change. Michael isn't coming back. We have to focus on what we can change and who we can change. Ingrid, go home. Pray. (soft music) - Look, I'm telling you, he is a runner. - Lookin' for love that ... Love that ... No! No freakin' lookin' for love crap, you brain-dead piece of-- - What is he doing? - [Teen] That's the new guy, isn't it? (picking guitar) - He's not bad. - He's pretty good. - That's right. (stomps guitar) - Man, don't touch me! It was just a kiddie piece of crap starter guitar! I put it out of its misery, man! Man, I had a guitar! - The one in your car? The one that you trashed? You're confined til group session tomorrow! (somber music) (gentle piano music) - [Receptionist] Actually, I was thinking maybe we could schedule it for June the 14th? Okay, yeah. And is there any other paperwork I need to bring besides the ID? Okay, I have to make a copy of the ID? Okay. And social security as well? (dramatic music) (siren wailing) (tires screeching) - Get in! Would you like to die like that? - Yes. - [Rose] Ingrid nailed him on a VCO! - Violation of court order. - He'll be locked up until he's 25. (cheering) - Sorry I'm late. May I? This is a list of victim's rights groups and their locations. You're all familiar with MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Some of you may genuinely benefit from what these groups do. - Peter, why are you-- - But that's not what we do. This is the last meeting of Just Us. Now, as a connection, I'm inviting you to join our Mercy Teens. There will be sacraments and counseling and listening. It's at the juvenile center at 5050 Reynolds Avenue. - That's where he's at! - Yes, it is. All the information is on the list. Call me. - Michael was like a son to you! (emotional music) Why does it feel like you left when Michael left? Or ... before. I can't breathe. I can't ... Please. Just ... let me see him in my dreams. Just let me see Michael in my dream. - [Father Peter] The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - [Teen] Amen. - [Announcer] Attention. All juvenile facility visitors must vacate the premises by 4:30. (knocking) - Hello? Father Peter Wexler, Our Lady of Grace Parish. The database said that you were Catholic. Or rather, it actually said ex-Cath, which seems kind of high-tech to me, so I thought that I would-- - Ex-Catholic. I don't believe that crap anymore. - Put away childish things. - [Alec] Exactly. - Good. Me too. Saint Paul said when he was older that he put away childish things. He was talking about growing closer to God. Childish faith just isn't enough anymore, is it? - Nothing's enough anymore. - [Father Peter] Not when you're carrying around a 1,000-pound backpack. - Don't need any more guilt. - I can see that. You've got enough already. Why don't you make confession and unload that backpack? No God, no guilt, right? - How could you-- No. No, whatever. I told you, I don't believe. - You know how you can't actually fly in a picture of an airplane? - What? - Real forgiveness is a plane you can fly in. It's so much better than pretending that you don't need to be forgiven. - Ah. So you forgive me? - Yes. - That's what you're supposed to say. - [Father Peter] True. - You know what I did? - Yes. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute, you were in the courtroom. You're the-- - Uncle ... of the boy that you killed. (smacks wall) - [Alec] Jesus! - Not really, but I'm trying. - I told you I didn't believe! You knew what the stupid "ex" meant! Even if I did believe, I wouldn't listen to some psycho priest like you! - All I want-- - No! No. Get out. Get outta here! (dramatic music) - In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. - Bless me, Father. It's been two months since my last confession. - Three. - These are my sins. - There's gotta be somethin'. You use the Lord's name in vain. - I do not! - Yes, you do. You say "oh my God". - That's not-- - Yes, it is. - God isn't his name, it's his title. I've never ... felt anything like this before, Peter. I mean ... even Evan's death ... that was ... clean. It's an ache that'll always be there, it'll never go away. But this ... I would rather be hit by a car myself every day for the rest of my life. Why? Why? Why would God let that happen? What is the purpose of an 18-year-old boy who has his whole life ahead of him be crushed? So what possible purpose could that serve? - Our families in Syria being beheaded or our girls in east India buses being raped? I don't know why God allows what He allows or does what He does. I just know that He tells me what He wants me to do. And I trust Him. - Well that's pretty frickin' one-sided, isn't it? And you're okay with that? - He doesn't ask my permission. - Well I am not okay with that, Peter. I am not okay with that. - Are you here to confess your sins or God's? - I'm here because ... because ... I'm drowning. And ... Okay, yeah, maybe I don't know. Maybe somewhere in here are my sins. But God is not coming to rescue me. I don't even want Him to rescue me. I want ... him. Peter, I don't know how to get to him. I hate him for what he's done, but nothing makes sense without him. - And you're here because ... - Because ... you said the other night ... You said that ... my rage won't bring Michael back. And you're right. Of course. Of course you are, but ... my rage ... that was all I had. And now I don't even have that. - Well if-- - You also said that ... That you and I, we should start to focus on what we can change and who we can change. What did you mean? - You heard that? Well ... I know that I said that God doesn't tell me why He does what He does. Sometimes I get a glimmer. Are you sure you wanna hear this? - No. But go on. - Michael was never yours. I think God is reminding you ... us, all of us ... that God is teaching us to love what He loves, who He loves, even if that means loving outsiders. And, yeah, forgiving them, the awful ones, that ones that we would never let in if it was up to you. - Oh my God! You're talking about him? That kid who killed Michael? How could you? How could He-- No. No! No, I was willing to try to move forward if I could or put it behind me, but that, that is going backwards! He is the gun that killed Michael. (emotional music) Hello? Peter! Peter? Peter? (soft music) So, God killed your son. How'd you get past it? I used to want to be exactly like you. Of course, you know that, 'cause you are the original mama bear. Actually, at first, I wanted to be a nun really bad. I wanted to be you. But then, you know, boys. Evan. And then a kid. So now I've got what you've got: dead son. I mean ... He forgave everyone because He's God. But you ... didn't have to forgive. And you did. I mean, duh, of course, I know you did, but ... But how? And Peter! Not my Peter, your Peter. He betrayed your son, they all did. Didn't you hate them for that? You must have. But you stayed with them. And you forgave them. How? How? (emotional music) One visit. (garbled radio speech) - Yeah? - [Ingrid] I'm here to see Alec McCortland. - Your name? - Oh, I ... I don't think I'm actually on the list. Ambelin. Ingrid Ambelin. - Huh. Aren't the ... What's her name? The king with all the wives wife. - [Ingrid] Henry VIII? - Yeah. - No. Oh. Not Anne Boleyn. Ambelin. A-M-B-E-L-I-N. - Sorry. I don't see it. If you're not on the PL, I can't let you through. - The ... - Permitted list. Unless of course the PD's already updated it. - The ... - Public defender. - Well, do you think you could call the PD about the PL? Sorry. I'm family. - Yeah, Mr. Gitmeier, please. Yeah, this is Sergeant Early over at 50/50. Thank you. Mr. Gitmeier. Yeah, this is Early over at Juvenile. Got somebody that wants to visit with Alec McCortland. No, she'd be the first. Yeah, Anne Boleyn. Ingrid Anne Boleyn. Really? From the victim's family? 'Cause we don't have her-- Are you sure? Because I don't think that-- All right. Thank you. Didn't say you were from that family. But Mr. Gitmeier's approved it, so I guess it's all right. I gotta tell you ... we don't do this. Ever. So, I'm gonna need you to promise me that, when you get in there, you're not gonna ... - Lose my head? I promise. (buzzing) It's coffee. From the lobby. I had to beg. They fished around there with a pencil, make sure there wasn't anything in them. I mean, it's what I do. Coffee. (clears throat) God. Only I use actually coffee beans. You know, it's the least you could do to make eye-- - I didn't do it on purpose! - What? Oh my God, this isn't a time out! What was I thinking? - I don't even know what he looked like. - What? - Your son. - He's ... He was ... taller than you, like his dad. - Is he ... - Dead too? Yes, 51, brain hemorrhage. Why the hell am I telling you this? - I'm sorry. About your husband. Yeah, that coffee seriously sucks. - You're sorry? About my husband? You're sorry about my husband when you can't even say that you're sorry-- - It just doesn't feel like I did it! I don't remember anything. It's totally surreal to me. It's just like a bad dream. - Oh it's real! It is real! I wake up every morning to how real it is! And just because you don't feel like it's real doesn't change reality one shred, one shred! - There was alcohol! And other stuff. And my car was messed up, but I couldn't afford to-- - I'm supposed to hate them for crushing the life out of Michael? I'm supposed to blame the alcohol and your messed up car and the other stuff for killing my son, for murdering him? God! If you can't say you're sorry, at least admit it! Admit it! Hell was I thinking? You know, the record said you're smart, but you talk like a five-year-old. - You read about me? My foster parents were quite erudite, actually, whetting my young mind with their succinct reasoning and engaging me in spirited discussions about the way-- - You ... do not have the right to be sarcastic with me! You don't have the right to be anything to me! What was I thinking? (bangs on door) (buzzing) - I did it. (soft music) - Michael! That's obscene! Thanks, Ben. Goodnight. (sighs) - Spill. - Spill what? - Ingrid? It's me. - Oh really? I went to see him. - Who? - McCortland! That kid who killed Michael. - Damn! Why? - Closure, maybe. Something. - [Nadine] You get it? - Not yet. Maybe never. It was torture. - You don't seem any worse. - [Ingrid] Or better. - You still hate him? - Yes. Maybe not so much. Oh stop it with the eyebrows. - You gonna go back? - No! - When I was a little girl, I remember hearing this story about how, when an oyster got a grain of sand in them, it hurts so much it makes them wanna cry. - Wow. That's really comforting. - Not done yet. - Sorry. Check. Sand. Continue. - So then after a while, the piece of sand gets all coated with their tears, until finally it doesn't hurt them anymore. Plus, the sand is now a beautiful ... - Pearl. Nadine! That is the corniest story! But ... it's also kind of beautiful. - Oh, you mushy old lady. - Hey! - Sorry. - School go late? - Honors club. - Rose, honey, are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine, Mama. I just feel him when I'm here, you know? (emotional music) - Sand. (curious music) No Alec. Ooh. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Holy 40 to life! What didn't you do? (humming) (drumming on table) Stop it! - Why are you here? - I forgive you. - What? No! - Look, I get it. Your father was a crazy, violent animal. He killed your mother. You were 12. So you started taking drugs and drinking and doing God knows what to get it outta your head, right? Burning through foster families. So I get it. You're forgiven. I forgive you, end of story. - No! (pounds table) - What? I thought that's what you wanted? - [Alec] No! - Well then what do you want? I'll tell you what I want. I want to ... breathe again. I want to ... not wake up every morning and say, "Shit! "I'm still alive." So I forgive you. You are forgiven. I just wanna be done. I wanna be done with this. I wanna be done with you. I wanna be done with everything. - I always tell people he's from Ireland, 'cause it sounds cooler. But he's really from Boston. And he doesn't get pissed because of some noble protest-y crap. He gets pissed when people don't do what he wants. - Pissed off or pissed drunk? - Both. He wants what he wants. That's it. His whole deal. He wants what he wants. You never knew when he'd be there. But when he was, he brought all kinds of video games and iPhones. He said it was for us. My mom didn't buy it, 'cause she didn't drink. - Wait, your mom didn't drink? - Well, maybe when I was little and Dez was around all the time. But by the time Neecie arrived ... She's not what you think. She worked her ass off! She volunteered all the time at the St. Tobias food pantry. Man, if she isn't in heaven, there isn't one. - Catholic. - [Alec] Was there more than one? - No, I meant that ... - She hated the way Dez lied. He'd stack all this stuff up in the corner and say it was for us, but then these douche bags would come over, get high, and leave with everything. And Dez would be like, "Well, you didn't want it." But when he was high ... Oh, when he was high, he was awesome! He was like this skinny R-rated Santa Clause. - Did she love him? - Maybe once. But Neecie's dad is who she really loved. - So your sister has a different dad? - Yeah. Only mom couldn't marry him because of God. - But she had a child with him. - Is that a problem for Catholic heaven? I started using before she died. - What? - He'd been gone for like a year, and all a sudden he's back, and he's got game boxes and TVs, and a guitar, my first guitar! An actual legit Taylor. I just wanted him to stay and be R-rated Santa all the time. So I asked him for a hit. And he rolled one just for me. At first, nothin'. But then, all of a sudden, it's like bam! (laughing) And we're like eating everything in sight and laughing. Oh, and he pours me a shot of leprechaun juice. God, I thought it was ... I thought it was real magic. 'Cause for the first time, I just didn't feel scared. I felt like a normal person, you know? I felt like everyone else feels. - Nobody ... feels normal. Everyone just thinks everybody else does. - So it was me? I did it. Just like I did your son. I ain't goin' to Catholic heaven or any other one, so ... So don't forgive me. Don't you forgive me! (bangs table) - [Ingrid] What happened? - You don't wanna know. - No! I don't! But I ... I think I need to. - I liked it, you know? I just liked it. I liked ... drinkin' booze and holdin' a joint. I don't know, it just made me feel kinda grown up, in a way. - Oh God, it's ironic. - What? - [Ingrid] Nothing! - Yeah, I know what ironic mean! - [Ingrid] I know you do! - Anyway ... Me and Dez, Dez and I ... get high. Sometimes he'd give me guitar lessons. Only Neecie ... God, he hated her. 'Cause of Marcus, Marcus Rowland. That was her dad. Dez would call Neecie a wigger. But Mom and Marcus would call her their golden child. I always wanted to be golden. - [Ingrid] What happened to Neecie? - They split us up. The foster people. We didn't have the same dad, and our mom was dead. - [Ingrid] Did you ever see her? - Once. After they first took us away. And I got to talk to her on the phone two years ago. Marcus was trying to get custody, but I was in re-bad, so I didn't get to talk to her very long. - What happened? - I told you. I killed her. I was afraid she was gonna make him leave! And then I was afraid she was gonna kill him. I just, I didn't care. I didn't care about either of them. I just ... I just cared about me! I mean, I wanted ... - What? What? - I wanted what I wanted. Just like him, I want what I want, that's it. And when she picked up that knife ... I was pissed, you know? She was ruining everything! And then all a sudden Neecie came in. - [Ingrid] And then what happened? - I took it from her! I took the knife from her and I gave it to him! - [Ingrid] You couldn't have known-- - No, I knew, and I gave it to him anyway! - Well then what happened next? - [Alec] I locked Neecie in her room. - [Ingrid] And then what? - What do you want me to say? I tried to stop him? I did it, I did it! I smashed up the guitar instead. I smashed up the Taylor, 'cause I was pissed. (crying) I killed her, I killed her. - [Ingrid] No. You didn't. He did. - I let him! (banging table) - You were 12 years old, Alec. (emotional guitar music) So do you sleep? (garbled radio speech) - Niacin. - Huh? - He needs niacin. - You a doctor? - No. - Then nope. Why? - Anxiety. I take them too. It's just a vitamin. - And you care because ... - Is there a doctor you could call to approve this? - Dr. Hasigawa. 'Cause he chopped off her head, right? - What? - Anne Boleyn. You said you weren't gonna lose your head in there. (phone ringing) - I mean, even our names. Peter, rock. Then I come along, and it's Ingrid, beautiful fertility goddess. (laughing) What the heck, Mom? - Now, what a minute. Wait, wait, wait. There was a St. Ingrid, wasn't there? - Some dicey, discredited pseudo saint, maybe. But compare to you, Saint-frickin'-Peter? - Please, Ingrid. You were still little when I went to seminary. You have no idea what I was like beforehand. - [Ingrid] Ooh, so tell. - Never, little sister. - Tell me. - All right. When Judy broke up with me, I went crazy. I mean, completely crazy. - Yeah, Judy Franken! I thought you were gonna marry her. - So did I. And the things that I smoke, and the things that I drank, and then the girls-- - No, no, no! No! I don't wanna see that in my head. - Neither do I. But I do. And every time some wreck of a human walks in the door ... it reminds me that that could be me. - So that's why you're mister grace? - To whom much is forgiven. See, I'm no better than Alec McCortland. I'm ... just luckier. - What is that? - Longerman's file on Alec McCortland. You still think he's the gun that killed Michael? - No. Wreck of a human, maybe. That kid. He's drowning in his own guilt. - I know. And he won't let anyone take it away from him, and so ... I'm praying that you can. - Save him? Oh, no. No, I am not in the business of saving Alec McCortland. That's your job. I'm just working on trying to not hate him. - But what if you're the only one who can? - Rose!

Ew. - Ew. I can't believe you came back. - I didn't plan to. Did you ... Did you get nia-- - Niacin! Yes! Yeah, it made me itchy. - Oh. Niacin flush. It does that. - Yeah, I read about it. - Researching? To make sure that I wasn't poisoning you? (chuckles) - I fell asleep. For the first time since the ... - Well, good. I take it, too, for ADD and probably OCD. My teacher's called it poor citizenship. (chuckles) Even now, when I see "citizenship" on a form, I feel like I should write "needs improvement". (laughing) - Yes! Oh, I can never, I can never stop the-- - The what? The racing thoughts, the distractions? - Oh, crap yeah! I mean, sometimes I just feel trapped with-- - With what, with your thoughts? - Are you my friend? - Don't push it. I'm ... just here. - So I've gotta be religious? - You do whatever you want. - Before I quit school, I used to argue with the religious geeks. If God is all-powerful, can he build a football field so big even He can't kick a field goal? Just to mess with them. I used to say, "Man makes God in his image." (laughs) Oh, I thought I was so deep. I thought I made that up. - You didn't. - Yeah, I know. I really thought I didn't believe in God anymore. It'd be a lot easier. - What? - Are you my friend? (gentle music) I feel trapped with me. - You said that ... you didn't believe? But then ... - Then you came back. And there's just no way you'd be here without God. (calm guitar music) - We ... received communion. - I didn't realize you were one of Father what's-his-name's little group. - I'm not. But my brother is Father Wexler, so ... - Well, I'm glad you're here. - There's ... There's someone else I want you to meet. Rose. This is Rose. She's my-- - Employee. - I was going to say she's like a daughter to me. Rose sings. - A little. - And she is ridiculously smart. You know, she's gonna go to UC, pre-law. - Cool. - Alec wants to major in music. Someday. - So, why law? - A friend of mine was killed, and ... - And Rose wants to help people. - Mama, I can't. - She also tutors third graders at Merksen Elementary, and all the kids really-- - He was my boyfriend, actually. - [Ingrid] Rose, don't! - Do you know who I'm talking about? - No, no. No, I don't. (soft music) Do you mean-- - Yes! Funny. He promised me he wouldn't go anywhere, that he wouldn't leave me, right before I saw him for the last time! - What is this? - I felt the same way about you, Alec, until I met you, and so I thought if Rose met you-- - But you fixed things, didn't you? You made sure I'd never see him again! - [Ingrid] Rose! - And now, you're taking her away from me? You're like some black hole that sucks everything down into it! Why law? So I can send people like you where they belong! - [Ingrid] No! - What? You're gonna hurt me, too? Well, guess what, you already have! - Rose! Rose? I'm sorry! I thought-- Honey, listen. Just wait a second. (punching wall) - It's okay, officer. He knows me. Can I talk to him? Would that be okay? - Five minutes! (punching wall) (grunting) - You break that bad enough, you won't be able to play the guitar. Penance, of course! - What? - You give up. The only thing that you have, and maybe God was-- - No, I was just pissed! - Real penance isn't a knife to cut. It's medicine to heal. - Whatever. Doesn't matter. I'm walkin' dead anyway. - Me too. - What? - Walking dead. Zombies. We all are. - Psycho priest. - Did you ever see I Am Legend? - [Alec] What, the movie? - With Will Smith. - I don't know. Maybe. - The book was better. But it's a great theology text. See, there's this man, the Will Smith character. And he hunts zombies, right? In the end, they capture him, and he finds out that some of them are still alive. Some of the ones that he's been killing. - Living walking dead? - The book is great! Seriously. It turns out they have these pills, this medicine, that keeps them alive. So, even thought they're zombies, they don't eat people like the dead dead ones do. They watch out for each other, and they keep each other alive. - You're a total geek. - The geeks shall inherit the earth. - Isn't that the meek? - Ha! You do know your bible! See ... we have the pill. - [Alec] What? - Jesus ... is our pill. He keeps us alive. We breathe out the disease that makes us walking dead when we confess our sins and take in his life and his blood. The ability to be alive, even though we were dead. (gentle music) (buzzing) - Look, I'm so sorry. No, I'm sorry. - I brought someone. - No, no, no, no, no, no, please! (soft music) (cries softly) - It's okay, Mom. - Michael, I-- - I know. I love you. - I love you too, Michael. - Michael was like, maybe, 13. And after mass one Sunday, he goes up, in the middle of everyone, and says, "Papa Peter, how do I get girls?" (laughing) He had this mischievous innocence. - Oh, I wish I'd known him. - Oh, you would have loved him. So anyway, Peter looks at my son and says, "There are three things that girls like." And then, he notices that, right there, there's this group of little old ladies, and they are standing there with their mouths hanging open. And he looks at 'em, and he goes, "What? "I wasn't born a priest." (laughing) Crazy! - He's kinda demented, you know? - [Ingrid] Yes. - Massively into Star Trek and zombies? - Oh! And don't even get him started on The Beatles. Saint John, Saint Paul, Saint George, Saint Ringo! - Seriously? - Oh yeah. - Well, they only reinvented music. Backtracking, phase shifting, multi-tracking, and their chord progressions are totally sick! - You know, one Sunday he did an entire homily on the lyrics of "Blackbird". "Take these sunken eyes and learn to see." - "All your life. "You were only waiting--" - "For this moment to be free." Whew. - So, I finished that song. - Wh-- The one that you couldn't-- - Yeah. - Well-- - I just ...

Could you pray for me? - Sure! We'll pray together. - No! Just you. - Lord ... bless this young man tomorrow. Be with him ... - We have heard well-prepared presentation by councils Longerman and Gitmeier, and I see no reason not to rule at this time. Alec McCortland, this court has shown tremendous leniency on your behalf. It is the very real intent of the Hamilton County Juvenile System to rehabilitate young people, not throw them away. But when every effort fails, your almost immediate violation of court order, Mr. McCortland, coupled with the clear warning I gave you previously, speak loudly of your need for harsher discipline. Yes, defense has made a dramatic case. It is extraordinary that Mrs. Ambelin would visit or even be allowed to visit Mr. McCortland in lockup. However, such circumstances say more about Mrs. Ambelin's character than yours. You have shown no willingness to change. Hence, I am inclined to sentence you to extended incarceration at DYS until the age of 25, at which time-- - He has changed, Your Honor. (soft music) - Mrs. Ambelin, this hearing is concluding. There are procedures for testifying. Mr. McCortland's defense did not submit any-- - He doesn't know anything about this. I'm sorry, Your Honor, it's just ... Would it change the outcome if Alec-- If Mr. McCortland had a legal guardian? - It might. But Mrs. Ambeline, CPS has documented the fact that Mr. McCortland does not have a legal guardian. - I have applied for legal guardianship of Alec McCortland. (moving music) - We do it this time, my way! - Let's do it. - All right? Let's go! - Let's go? - We're done! Let's go. - All right, let's go. - [Receptionist] I'm very sorry, but I don't-- - You're sorry? How do you lose a child? - I didn't lose a child. - He's not even 18! - Can I help you? - Yes. My ... Alec McCortland was supposed to be brought here half an hour ago by Detective Carny. - We're aware of that Mrs. ... - Ambelin! It's Mrs. Ambelin! - Carny's car was here-- - Did you call Detective Carny? - Yes, but he never answered. When the car ex-officers are on duty, they usually-- - We really should wait until we hear from Carny. - What? Wait til he gets off of work a couple hours from now? Alec could be dead by then. - What if you find him? I mean, what are you gonna do? - I don't know, Peter. But I just can't sit here and not do anything. (dramatic music) - [Father Peter] Ingrid! - What up H? So ... Listen, dude. I got some contacts in the burbs. - [Dealer] What are you sayin'? - You know rich white kids, just itchin' for this shit. - Where did he get the money? And why is he still there? - [Father Peter] We can't handle this ourselves. I'm callin' Carny. - You Daymond? - What's up? - Daymond, I got a way for us to make some money. - [Father Peter] Ingrid, no! - [Ingrid] Alec! - [Dealer] Who the hell's this? Who is she? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! (gun bangs) (delicate piano music) (siren wailing) - Stay with me. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're okay. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay. - [Officer] Police, stop! - Through this holy oil and His great mercy, may God forgive you for any sins that you may have committed. - You're okay, you're okay, you're okay. - It was a sting. - What? - You think I just happened to show up? Look, it was his idea. He said he would do it with or without us. So I said ... Look, it wasn't supposed to go down like that. - He's 17! - We've been trying to nail this guy for months! - I don't care what you've been trying! You don't put a kid at risk! And my sister! - I heard. - Go. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Look, I know I screwed up. And Judge Graham knows it, too. Trust me. She set me straight on procedure. But the shooter and the kingpin are down for the count. Look, the guy's phone list is golden. All kinds of NTs are on there. Anyway ... the kid's be readmitted to Merskin. You're authorized to pick him up and bring him back at any time. The hours are on there. - Thanks. - I'm sorry, Father. - For when you're ready.

You belong here! - No, no, I can't. - It was your prayers. - I put her here! Don't you get that? - [Father Peter] No, stop it! Stop it! - What? - You are not the center of the universe, Alec! Things don't happen just because of you!

And I killed my mother, and I almost killed her. - And you're leaving someone out. Who put him there? (emotional music) - I did. - I did. - And so did I. - No. No, no, no. After what I did to you? The bullet? - I chose that bullet, Alec. And he chose that. - You saved my life. Twice. - No choice. You're my pearl. It's a long story. - I think I'm ready to go to confession now.
