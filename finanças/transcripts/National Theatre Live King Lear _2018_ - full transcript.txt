Yet better thus, and known to be despised, Than still despised and flattered To be worst, The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune, Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear The lamentable change is from the best, The worst returns to laughter Welcome then, Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst Owes nothing to thy blasts But who comes here? My father, poorly led? World, world, O world! O my good lord, I have been your tenant, And your father's tenant, these fourscore years Away, get thee away: good friend, be gone Thy comforts can do me no good at all: Thee they may hurt You cannot see your way I have no way, and therefore want no eyes. I stumbled when I saw O my dear son Edgar, The food of thy abused father's wrath, Might I but live to see thee in my touch, I'd say I had eyes again How new? Who's there? O gods! Who is it can say 'I am at the worst'? I am worse than ever I was 'Tis a poor mad Tom And worse I may be yet: the worst is not, So long as we can say 'This is the worst' Fellow, where guest? Is it a beggar-man? - Madman, and beggar too He has some reason, else he could not beg In last night's storm I such a fellow saw, Which made me think a man a worm My son came then into my mind, and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him I have heard more since As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods: They kill us for their sport Bless thee, master Is that the naked fellow? - Ay, my lord Then prithee get thee away. If, for my sake, Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain I'the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love, And bring some covering for this naked soul Which I'll entreat to lead me Mack, sir, he is mad 'Tis the time's plague, when madmen lead the blind I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have, Come on't what will Sirrah, naked fellow- Poor Tom's a-cold (I cannot daub it further) Come hither, fellow (And yet I must) Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed Know'st thou the way to Dover'? Poor Torn hath been scared out of his good wits Dost thou know Dover'? - Ay, master There is a cliff, whose high and bending head Looks fearfully into the confined deep Bring me but to the very brim of it, And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me From that place I shall no leading need Give me thy arm Poor Torn shall lead thee Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way Now, where's your master'? Ma'am, within, but never man so changed I told him of the army that was landed: He smiled at it I told him you were coming: His answer was, 'The worse' Of Gloucester's treachery, And of the loyal service of his son, When I informed him, then he called me sot, And told me I had turned the wrong side out Then shall you go no further It is the cowish terror of his spirit That dares not undertake Back, Edmund, to my brother, Hasten his musters, and conduct his powers I must change arms at home, and give the distaff Into my husband's hands This trusty servant shall pass between us Ere long you are like to hear (if you dare venture in your own behalf) a mistress's command Wear this: spare speech, decline your head This kiss, if it durst speak, Would raise thy spirits up into the air Conceive, and fare thee well Yours in the ranks of death My most dear Gloucester! O, the difference of man and man To thee a woman's services are due: A fool usurps my bed Ma'am, here comes my lord I have been worth the whistling O Goneril, you are not worth the dust which the rude wind blows in your face No more: the text is foolish Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile: Filths savour but themselves. What have you done? Tigers, not daughters, what have you perfumed? A father, and a gracious aged man, Whose reverence even the head-lugged bear would lick, Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded If that the heavens do not their visible spirits Send quickly down to tame these vile offences, It will come Humanity must perforce prey on itself Like monsters of the deep Milk-livered man! Where's thy drum? France spreads his banners in our noiseless land, Whilst thou, a moral fool, sits still, and cries 'Alack, why does he so?' See thyself, devil! Proper deformity shows not in the fiend So horrid as in woman O vain fool! Thou changed and self-covered thing, for shame, Be-monster not thy feature Were't my fitness To let these hands obey my blood, They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones However thou art a fiend, A woman's shape doth shield thee Marry, your manhood! Mew! What news? O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead, Slain by his servant, going to put out The other eye of Gloucester Gloucester's eyes? - Both, both, my lord This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer: 'Tis from your sister One way I like this well: But being widow, and my Edmund with her, May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life Another way the news is not so tan. I'M read and answer Where was his son when they did take his eyes? Come with my lady hither He is not here? - No, my good lord, I met him back again Knows he the wickedness? - Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he informed against him, And quit the house on purpose that their punishment Might have the freer course Gloucester, I live To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King, And to revenge thine eyes Come hither, friend, Tell me what more thou know'st Did my letter pierce Cordelia to any demonstration of grief? You have seen sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears were like a better way Made she no verbal question? Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father' Pantingly forth, as if it pressed her heart, Cried 'Sisters! Sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters! Kent! Father! Sisters! What, I'the storm, I'the night?' Then away she started To deal with grief alone It is the stars, The stars above us govern our conditions You spoke not with her since? - No Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's in the town, Who sometime in his better tune remembers What we are come about, and by no means will yield to see his daughter Why, good lady? A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness, That stripped her from his benediction, turned her to foreign casualties, gave her dear rights to his dog-hearted daughters These things sting his mind so venomously that burning shame detains him from Cordelia Alack, poor gentleman! Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not? They are afoot Well, sir, let us go seek Cordelia Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now, As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud, Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds, With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn A century send forth Search every acre in the high-grown field And bring him to our eye What can man's wisdom In the restoring his bereaved sense? He that helps him, take all my outward worth There is means, madam. Our foster-nurse of nature is repose, the which he lacks All blest secrets, All you unpublished virtues of the earth, Spring with my tears! Be aidant and remediate In the good man's distress. Seek, seek for him, Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it News, madam: The British powers are marching hitherward 'Tis known before. Our preparation stands In expectation of them O dear father, It is thy business that I go about Therefore great France My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied No blown ambition doth our arms incite, But love, dear love, and our aged father's right Soon may I hear and see him! Kent! It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out, To let him live Where he arrives he moves all hearts against us Edmund, I think, is gone, in pity of his misery, to dispatch his nighted life: Moreover, to discover the strength of the enemy I must needs after him, ma'am, with my letter But are my brother's powers set forth? - Ay, ma'am Our troops set forth tomorrow. Stay with us: The ways are dangerous I may not, ma'am. My lady charged my duty in this business Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you Transport her purposes by word? Belike some thing, I know not what I'll love thee well, Let me unseal the letter Madam, I had rather- I know your lady does not love her husband, I am sure of that: and at her late being here, She gave strange œillades and most speaking looks To noble Edmund “mow you axe oi her bosom I, ma'am? - I speak in understanding: you are, I know't Therefore I do advise you, take this note My lord is dead: Edmund and I have talked, And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady's You may gather more: If you do find him, I pray you give him this And when your mistress hears thus much from you, I pray desire her call her wisdom to her So, fare you well If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor, Preferment falls on him that cuts him off Would I could meet him, ma'am, I would show What lady I do follow Fare thee well When shall I come to the top of that same hill? You do climb up it now. Look how we labour Methinks the ground is even Horrible steep. Hark... Do you hear the sea? No, truly Why then, your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes' anguish So may it be indeed Methinks thy voice is altered, and thou speak'st In better phrase and matter than thou didst You are much deceived: in nothing am I changed But in my garments Methinks you are better spoken Come on, sir, here's the place. Stand still How fearful and dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low, The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles Halfway down Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade Methinks he seems no bigger than his head The fishermen that walk upon the beach Appear like mice The murrnuring surge, That on the unnumbered idle pebble chafes, Cannot be heard so high I'll look no more, lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight topple down headlong Set me where you stand You are now within a foot Of the extreme verge Let go my hand. Here, friend, another purse: in it, a jewel well worth a poor man's taking Go thou further off, Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going Now fare ye well, good sir - With all my heart Why I do trifle thus with his despair, ls done to cure it O you mighty gods! This world I do renounce, and in your sights Shake patiently my great affliction off If I could bear it longer, and not fall To quarrel with your great opposeless wills, My snuff and loathed part of nature should Burn itself out If Edgar live, O, bless him Now, friend, fare thee well Good sir. Farewill And yet I know not how conceit may rob The treasury of life, when life itself yields to the theft Had he been where he thought, By this had thought been past Alive or dead? Ho, you sir! Friend! Hear you, sir'? Speak Thus might he pass indeed Yet he revives What are you, sir? - Away, and let me die Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air, So many fathom down precipitating, Thou'dst shivered like an egg But thou dost breathe: Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again But have I fallen or no? From the dread summit of this chalky bourn Look up a-height, the shrill-gorged lark so far Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up Mack, I have no eyes ls wretchedness deprived that benefit To end itself by death? Give me your hand Up... up... So, how is it? Feel you your legs? You stand Too well, too well - This is above all strangeness Upon the crown o'the cliff, what thing was that Which parted from you? A poor unfortunate beggar As I stood here below, methought his eyes Were two full moons He had a thousand noses, Horns whelked and waved like the enridged sea It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father, Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear affliction, till it do cry out itself 'Enough, enough', and die That thing you speak of, I took it for a man Often 'twould say 'The fiend, the fiend'. He led me to that place Bear free and patient thoughts No, they cannot touch me for coining - But who comes here? I am the King himself O thou side-piercing sight! Nature's above an, in that respect. There's your press-money That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw me a clothier's yard Look... look, a mouse Peace, this piece of toasted cheese will do it There's my gauntlet... I'll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills O, well flown, bird. I'the clout, I'the clout: Hewgh! Give the word Sweet marjoram - Pass I know that voice Ha! Goneril, with a white beard? They flattered me like dogs, and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out Go to, they are not men of their words: they told me I was everything 'Tis a lie: I am not ague-proof The trick of that voice I do well remember: ls't not the King? Ay, every inch a king When I do stare, see how the subject quakes I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No, the wren goes to it, and the small gilded fly Does lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to his father than my daughters got between the lawful sheets To it, lechery, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers Behold yond simpering dame, That minces virtue, and does shake the head To hear of pleasure's name The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to it With a more riotous appetite Down from the waist they are centaurs, Though women all above But to the girdle do the gods inherit, Beneath is all the fiends' There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit: burning, scalding, stench, consumption Fie, fie, fie! Pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary: sweeten my imagination. There's money for thee O let me kiss that hand Let me wipe it first, it smells of mortality O ruined piece of nature, this great world Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me? I remember thine eyes well enough Dost thou squinny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid, I'll not love Read thou this challenge, mark but the penning of it Were all the letters suns, I could not see one I would not take this from report: it is, And my heart breaks at it Read - What with, the case of eyes? O ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light Yet you see how this world goes I see it feelingly What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes Look with thine ears: see how yon justice rails upon yond simple thief Hark in thine ear: change places, and handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar? - Ay, sir And the creature run from the our'? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: A dog's obeyed in office Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand. Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind For which thou whipp'st her The usurer hangs the cozener Through tattered clothes great vices do appear: Robes and furred gowns hide all Get thee glass eyes, and like a scurvy politician seem to see the things thou dost not Now... Pull off my boots. Harder, harder, so O matter and impertinency mixed: Reason in madness! If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes I know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester Thou must be patient We came crying hither: thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air we wawl and cry I will preach to thee: mark me Alack, alack the day When we are born, we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools This is a good block It were a delicate stratagem to shoe a troop of horse with felt I'll put it in proof, And when I have stolen upon these sons-in-laws, Then kW, kW, kW, kW, kW, kW! Here he is: lay hand upon him, sirs Sir! Your most dear daughter - No rescue? What, am I a prisoner? I am even The natural fool of fortune Use me well, you shall have ransom Let me have surgeons, I am cut to the brains You shall have anything No seconds? All myself? - Good sir... I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king, My masters, know you that? You are a royal one, and we obey you Then there's life in it. Come, an you get it, you shall get it by running Sir, do you hear aught of a battle toward? Everyone hears that, Which can distinguish sound But, by your favour, How near's the other army? Near, and on speedy foot - I thank you, sir You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please Well pray you, father Now, good sir, what are you? A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows, Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows, Am pregnant to good pity Give me your hand, I'll lead you to some biding Hearty thanks Thou old, unhappy traitor, Briefly thyself remember The steel is out that must destroy thee Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to it Wherefore, bold peasant, Darest thou support a published traitor? Hence, lest that the infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee. Let go his arm I'll not let go, sir Let go, slave, or thou dies! - I'M pick your teeth, sir Out, dunghill! If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body, And give the letters which thou find'st about me To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester Seek him out upon the British party I know thee well. A serviceable villain, As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire What, is he dead? Sit you down, father: rest you Let's see these pockets. The letters that he speaks of May be my friends. Let us see My dearest Edmund, Let our reciprocal vows be remembered You have many opportunities to cut him off if you are willing, time and place will be fruitfully offered If he return the conqueror, then am I the prisoner, and his bed my gaol, from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me Your - wife, so I would say - affectionate servant, Goneril Here in the sands, thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified of murderous lechers: and with this ungracious paper strike the sight of the death-practised Duke For him 'tis well That of thy death and business I can tell The King is mad: better I were distract, So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs, And woes by wrong imaginations lose The knowledge of themselves Give me your hand: Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum Come, father, I'M bestow you with a friend O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work To match thy goodness? My life will be too short, And every measure fail me To be acknowledged, madam, is o'er-paid Be better suited: These weeds are memories of those worser hours I prithee, put them off Pardon, dear madam: Yet to be known shortens my made intent My boon I make it, that you know me not, Till time and I think meet Then be it so, my good lord How does the King? Madam, sleeps still O you kind gods, Cure this great breach in his abused nature The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up Of this child-changed father So please your majesty, That we may wake the King? He hath slept long Be governed by your knowledge, and proceed In the sway of your own will Be by, good madam, when we do awake him: I doubt not of his temperance Very well Please you, draw near. Louder the music there O my dear father! Restoration, hang Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss repair those violent harms that my two sisters have in thy reverence made Kind and dear princess! Was this a face To be opposed against the jarring winds? To stand against the deep dread-batted thunder, In the most terrible and nimble stroke Of quick cross lightning? Mine enemy's dog, though he had bit me, should have stood that night against my fire And wast thou fain, poor father, To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn, In short and musty straw? Alack, alack, 'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all He wakes Speak to him Madam, do you: 'Us fittest How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty? You do me wrong to take me out of the grave Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead Sir, do you know me? You are a spirit, I know: where did you die? Still, Still, far wide He's scarce awake, let him alone awhile Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight? I am mightily abused: I should even die with pity To see another thus I know not what to say. I will not swear these are my hands... Let's see I felt that pin-prick. Would I were assured Of my condition O look upon me, sir, And hold your hand in benediction o'er me No, sir, you must not kneel Pray do not mock me. I am a very foolish fond old man, Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less And, to deal plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind Methinks I should know you... and know this man Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant What place this is, and all the skill I have remembers not these garments, Nor I know not where I did lodge last night Do not laugh at me, For, as I am a man, I think this lady To be my child... Cordelia And so I am: I am Be your tears wet? Yes, faith: I pray, weep not I know you do not love me, for your sisters Have, as I do remember, done me wrong You have some cause, they have not No cause, no cause Am I in France? In your own kingdom, sir Do not abuse me Be comforted, good madam: the great rage You see is killed in him And yet it is danger To make him even o'er the time he has lost Desire him to go in: trouble him no more Till further settling Will it please your highness walk? You must bear with me I pray you now, forget and forgive I am old and foolish 'Tis time to look about. The powers of the kingdom approach apace The arbitrement is like to be bloody My point and period will be throughly wrought, Or well or ill, as this days battle's fought Now, sweet lord, You know the goodness I intend upon you Tell me but truly, but then speak the truth, Do you not love my sister? In honoured love But have you never found my brother's way To the forfended place? That thought abuses you I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosomed with her, as far as we call hers No, by mine honour, madam I never shall endure her: dear my lord, Be not familiar with her Our very loving sister, well be-met Sir, this I heard, the King is come to his daughter, With others, whom the rigour of our state Forced to cry out Where I could not be honest, I never yet was valiant For this business, It touches us as France invades our land, Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear, Most just and heavy causes make oppose Sir, you speak nobly Why is this reasoned? - Combine together 'gainst the enemy For these domestic and particular broils Are not the issue here Let's then determine With the ancient of war on our proceeding I shall attend you presently at your tent Sister, you'll go with us? No 'Tis most convenient: I pray you, go with us O ho, I know the riddle. I will go My lord If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor, Hear me one word I'll overtake you. Speak Before you fight the battle, ope this letter If you have victory, let the signal sound For him that brought it Wretched though I seem, I can produce a champion that will prove what is avouched there If you miscarry, Your business of the world hath so an end, And machination ceases Fortune love you Stay till I have read the letter - I was forbid it When time shall serve, let but the herald cry, And I'll appear again Why, fare thee well, I will o'erlook thy paper The enemy's in view, draw up your powers Here is the guess of their true strength and forces By diligent discovery But your haste is now urged on you We will greet the time To both these sisters have I sworn my love: Each jealous of the other, as the stung Are of the adder Which of them shall I take? Both? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive To take the widow Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril And hardly shall I carry out my side, Her husband being alive Now then, we'll use His countenance for the battle: which being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off As for the mercy Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia, The bathe done, and they within our power, Shah never see his pardon For my stale Stands on me to defend, not to debate Follow me Here, father, take the shadow of this tree For your good host: pray that the right may thrive If ever I return to you again, I'll bring you comfort Grace go with you, sir Away, old man! Give me thy hand: away King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter taken. Give me thy hand: come on No further, sir: a man may rot even here What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure Their going hence, even as their coming hither Ripeness is all Come on And that's true too Some officers take them away We are not the first Who with best meaning have incurred the worst For thee, oppressed King, I am cast down: Myself could else out-frown false Fortune's frown Shall we not see these daughters, and these sisters? No, no, no, no. Come, let's away to prison. We two alone will sing like birds in the cage When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness So we'll live, and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues talk of court news, and we'll talk with them too Who loses and who wins, who's in, who's out, And take upon us the mystery of things, As if we were God's spies Take them away Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee? He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven, And fire us hence, like foxes. Wipe thine eyes The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell, Ere they shall make us weep We'll see them starved first. Come Come hither, captain Hark. Take thou this note, go follow them to prison One step I have advanced thee If thou dost as this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way to noble fortunes Know thou this, that men are as the time is To be tender-minded does not become a sword: thy great employment will not bear question Either say thou'lt do it, or thrive by other means - I'll do it, my lord About it, and write happy when thou has! done. Carry it so as I have set it down If it be man's work I'll do it Sir, you have the captives Who were the opposites of this day's strife I do require them of you, so to use them... ...As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine Sir, I thought it fit To send the old and miserable King... ...To some retention and appointed guard With him I sent the Queen, and they are ready To appear tomorrow, or at further space, where you shall hold your session Sir, by your patience, I hold you but a subject of this war, not as a brother That's as we list to grace him Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded Ere you had spoke so far He led our powers, Bore the commission of my place and person, The which immediacy may well stand up, And call itself your brother Not so hot: in his own grace he doth exalt himself More than in your advancement In my rights, by me invested, he compeers the best That were the most, if he should husband you Jesters do oft prove prophets Holla, holla! That eye that told you so looked but asquint Lady, I am not well, else I should answer From a full-flowing stomach General... Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony Witness the world, that I create thee here My lord and master Mean you to enjoy him then? The let-alone lies not in your good will - Nor in thine, lord Half-blooded fellow, yes Let the drum strike, and prove my We thine Stay yet, hear reason Edmund, I arrest thee on capital treason: and, in thy attaint, this gilded serpent For your claim, fair sister, I bar it in the interest of my wife 'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord, And I her husband contradict your banns If you will marry, make your loves to me: My lady is bespoke An interlude Thou art armed, Edmund If none appear to prove upon thy head Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons, There is my pledge. I'll prove it on thy heart Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less Than I have here proclaimed thee Sick, O sick! If not, I'M ne'er trust poison There's my exchange. What in the world he is That names me traitor, villain-like he lies He that dares, approach On him, on you, who not, I will maintain My truth and honour firmly My sickness grows upon me She is not well, convey her to my tent Trust to thy single virtue, for thy soldiers, all levied in my name, have in my name took their discharge Let the signal be called If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army... ...will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third signal. He is bold in his defence. Sound! Again Again Hold! Ask him his purposes, why he appears Upon this signal What are you? Your name, your quality, and why you answer this present summons? Know, my name is lost, yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope withal Which is that adversary? What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester? Himself: what sayst thou to him? - Thou art a traitor False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father, Conspirant against this high illustrious prince, And from the extremest upward of thy head To the descent and dust below thy foot, A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no', This staff, this arm, and my best spirits are bent To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak, Thou liest Back do I toss these treasons to thy head, Which for they yet glance by, and scarcely bruise, This blade of mine shall give them instant way, Where they shall rest for ever Save him, save him! This is mere practice, Gloucester By the law of war, thou wast not bound to face An unknown opposite Thou art not vanquished, But cozened and beguiled Shut your mouth, dame, Or with this paper shall I stop it Hold, sir! Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil Nay, no tearing, lady, I perceive you know it Say if I do, the laws are mine, not thine: Who can arraign me for it? Most monstrous! Know'st thou this paper'? - Ask me not what I know Go after her. She's desperate, govern her What you have charged me with, that have I done, And more, much more, the time will bring it out 'Tis past, and so am I But what art thou that hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble, I do forgive thee Let's exchange charity I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund If more, the more thou hast wronged me My name is Edgar, and thy father's son The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us The dark and vicious mace where thee he got Cost him his eyes The wheel is come full circle: I am here I must embrace thee Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I Did hate thee, or thy father Worthy prince, I know it How have you known the miseries of your father? By nursing them, my lord List a brief tale, And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst The bloody proclamation taught me to shift Into a madman's rags, and in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings, Their precious stones new lost: became his guide, Led him, begged for him, saved him from despair Never - O fault! - revealed myself unto him, Until some half hour past, and from first to last Told him my pilgrimage But his flawed heart, Alack, too weak the conflict to support, 'Twixt two extremes of passion, }oy and grief, Burst smilingly If there be more, more woeful, hold it in, For I am almost ready to dissolve, hearing of this Help, help: O help! - What kind of help? Speak, man - What means this Moody knife? 'Tis hot, it smokes, It came even from the heart of - O, she's dead Who dead? Speak, man Your lady sir, your lady. And her sister By her is poisoned: she confesses it I was contracted to them both: all three Now marry in an instant Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble, Touches us not with pity But who comes here? Sir, the banished Kent - Is this she? I am come to bid my King and master aye goodnight. Is he not here? Great thing of us forgot! Speak, Edmund, where's the King? And where's Cordelia? See'st thou this object, Kent? Mack, why thus? Yet Edmund was behaved The one the other poisoned for my sake, And after slew herself Cover their faces I pant for life: some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature Quickly send - be brief in it - to the castle, for my writ is on the life of Lear, and on Cordelia Nay, send in time - Run, run, O run! To who, my hard? Who has the office? Send thy token of reprieve Well thought on: take my blade, Give it the captain Haste thee for thy life He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison, and to lay the blame upon her own despair, That she fordid herself The gods defend her Hawk hawk hawk hawk! O, you are men of stones Had I your tongues and eyes, I'd use them so That heaven's vault should crack She's gone for ever. I know when one is dead, and when one lives She's dead as earth Lend me a looking-glass If that her breath will mist or stain the stone, Why, then she lives Is this the promised end? - Or image of that horror'? Fall and cease This feather stirs, she lives If it be so, it is a chance which does redeem all sorrows that ever I have felt O, my good master - Prithee, away 'Tis noble Kent, your friend A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all! I might have saved her, now she's gone for ever Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little Ha? What is'! thou sayst? Her voice was ever soft, Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee 'Tis true, my lords, he did - Did I not, fellow? I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion I would have made them skip I am old now, And these same crosses spoil me Who are you? Mine eyes are not of the best, I'll tell you straight If Fortune brag of two she loved and hated, One of them we behold Are you not Kent? The same, your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius? He's a good fellow, I can tell you that. He'll strike and quickly too. He's dead and rotten No, my good lord, I am the very man... I'M see that straight ...That from your first of difference and decay, Have followed your sad steps You're welcome hither Nor no man else. All's cheerless, dark, and deadly Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, And desperately are dead Ay, so I think He knows not what he says, and vain is it Thai we present us to him Edmund is dead, my lord That's but a trifle here: You lords and noble friends, know our intent What comfort to this great decay may come Shall be applied For us, we will resign, during the life of this old majesty, to him our absolute power All friends shall taste the wages of their virtue, and all foes the cup of their deservings O see, see! And my poor Fool is hanged. No, no, no life? Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life, And thou no breath at all? Tnou'It come no more, Never, never, never, never, never Pray you, undo this button Thank you, sir Do you see this? Look on her. Look her lips, Look there, look there My lord, my lord! Break, heart, I prithee break Look up, my lord Vex not his ghost, O let him pass He hates him that would upon the rack of this tough world stretch him out longer He is gone indeed The wonder is, he hath endured so long: He but usurped his life Friends of my soul, you twain, Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain I have a journey, sir, shortly to go: My master calls me, I must not say no The weight of this sad time we must obey, Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say The oldest hath borne most: we that are young Shall never see so much, nor live so long
