Congratulations on your graduation... Just forget about it, Kujo. - It's open. - Holy shit! Right on! 25th Asahi High School Graduation Ceremony What a valuable thing, my teacher's favor was, Taxi! Wait, asshole! Go, go! Just get out of here! Hurry, go! You're dead! Don't lose him! - Come back, you prick! - You're dead! - Come back, you asshole! - Get back here! ...many years already passed, on a campus where I learnt... Chump. Total chump. - Look at him. - What an idiot! Looking back I see, that the years flew by, lt's time to separate, To say goodbye... Shit! Don't stare, Kujo, he'll beat the shit outta you! He's got a bad temper. So what? So what? He's so fuckin' slow. Ooh, I'm gonna rat on you. Wanna die? Step closer, Kujo. Forget me, you get in. I'll take it. Still camera shy? Some guys just don't want to remember the good days. What a waste. Here we go. Say cheese... Here we are... Whoa, it's high! This is bad. Damn, you're gonna die. Nice view, huh? Holy shit! Hori, I don't think you should do this. You see this, Kujo? No way, man! You can't clap here. I'll pass. I'll pass, too. Me too. Yeah! Shit, this is high! C'mon, you chicken shits! Ready? Ready! One! Oh shit! Two! God damn! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! In the town of the water buffalo horn... I realised the fate of wood is eventually to burn. Long red hair Kerry. Long red hair Kerry. Long red hair Kerry. Long red hair Kerry. On a chipped brooch with a rusty pin, the message read, ''I'm a stone from the moon.'' Where sun and stone melt together, there is only frozen sea. Can you hear the scream of the fish? I can hear the sea spirit screaming... Long red hair Kerry. Long red hair Kerry. Can you hear the scream of the fish? I can hear the sea spirit screaming... Blue Spring 8 claps: Kujo Man, 8 times is ridiculous. Now Kujo's the boss. How interesting. Whoever claps most, is boss. That's our rule. Hooray for Kujo, the boss! It's a load of shit. Fuck off, Kujo! You're nobody's boss. What? What do you want, fucker? What do you want, you shit? What the hell do you want? Let go, asshole. I said let go. Fucking let go! Hey, you little... Shit, that's snot.. Are you OK? That's a Kujo special, the nasal twist. I like that. Are you OK? Hori, are you OK? Are you OK? Today we'll be covering the birth of the warrior clans and the Kamakura society... As we discovered last week, the revulsion towards the Heike clan increased, and in 1177 the Shigatini affair eventually blew up. The disaffection of a trusted servant towards the Heike family grew... Aoki, don't bother waking up the Ghost. Why? That's not fair. This is class time. Look who's talking. Besides, he's sick. Eat your meal at lunch! Lunch! I'd quit school if I were him. As Minamoto no Yoritomo, Minamotono Yoshinaka in Izu, and other samurai warriors raised an army, some local warriors joined the fight to expand their territories, and this lead to Civil War throughout the whole country. This is called either the Jishou or Chisho Civil War. You can call it either. I'd like you all to look at this chronological table. - In May 1177... - Hey. In 1179, Taira no Kiyomori mustered his troops... The guy creeps me out. Heard he broke Hori's nose. Word is, he's the boss now. He's a sick freak. But really he's just a nerd, a total nerd. Hell of a class we're in. Scary shit. ...en comes up in exams. Then Minamoto no Yoritomo raised... Yoshinaka followed. Thus the warrior clans came into being. What're you drawing, Kujo? Before long squabbles broke out amongst the various factions... What is it? Who is it? - Dunno, - Dunno? - And then in December in 1180... - Dunno. Dunno? Getting chilly. Let's go get warm. C'mon, you can tell me, right? Leo, that's Kujo. Don't stare. Look at those juniors! Can't even pay you respect! Why are you keeping so cool about this? If someone's dissing you, just fuck 'em over. They're just a bunch of idiots. We'll freeze 'em one of these days. You gotta show them, man. Show what? That you're the boss, Kujo. Don't let them fuck with you. You're more cut out for this, Aoki. You were boss in junior high, too. That's not what I mean. - You'd be better, for real. - I said that's not what I mean. Kujo, you're seriously good at soccer. You'd make it to the nationals if the rest of the team was any good. I don't care about winning anymore. You should aim for the world stage, like Nakata. Stop winding me up... I only joined the team because you asked me to. What's up? You guys gonna make it to the baseball nationals? We lost, I'll just watch 'em on TV. Ow, shit, my nose... still hurts... Are you OK, Hori? You OK? Kujo's Turf 'So when scatterbrains bump into people on the street, they're clueless who they are...' 'It happens all the time.' 'I was shocked and rushed back home.' 'But my wife threw me out as it was too earIy...' OK, shall we play it again? Wish I couId burn 'em. Press down firm, or you won't get any sound. The string's rusted. My fingers hurt. Tea time? We're going to the store. OK Let's take it from the start. Man, my stomach hurts... Bad timing as always. Gimme me some paper, Yukio. 4th floor stalls are broken. Try the 3rd floor. Got it. Yoshimura! Yeah? Go buy me some guitar strings! - Electric? - Accoustic! Got it. Tell me, is Aoki your gofer? I've known him since we were wet behind the ears. Since you were little kids, huh? He's a good guy. Is he? I don't believe that. I don't have any other friends. I think it's your personality that's the problem. Maybe. You kids are going to flunk. How rude. If we do, we'll drop out. Or we'll graduate which is fine, and apply to college. You want to try growing flowers. But would they bloom? No way. Black flowers, maybe. That'd be cool. Water it every morning, each of you. Are you serious? What a drag! - What flower is this? - You'll find out soon. Won't bloom, anyway. Never know. Oh, shit! Damn, it reeks! Flush it, you ass! Don't be heaping it up! Get outta there! Can't you shit at home, moron! Damn, it reeks! So we lost our baseball game. You were aiming for the nationals? Of course, they'll never have me if we don't win. Do it, then. Get it together now. Too late, no interest. - No interest. - That's just you. Forget it, my life's about more than baseball now. Yuck! What happened to you? Just look at him, Kujo. What a dork. What the hell happened to you, Aoki? I'm killing that goddam half-breed! Stop, you fuck! Stop, you fuck! I said stop! Half-breed! Wait a sec... What the fuck! I'm trying to take a piss. What's your problem? You think just because you're a senior... 365 days in a year... Bound to be days like this. Maybe I'm cursed. My New Year's fortune sucked! - It's gotta be your personality. - Am I that bad? Better than me. That's not really saying much. You're older than me. I said that doesn't mean anything. Cut a bit too much. Want me to line it up? Of course I want it lined up! What're you doing after you graduate? Work? College? We'll never make it to college. You think? I mean, we're cutting class right now, man. Got a point. Not likely, huh. What about you? I don't know. You don't know? This is about you, man! I realize that. But I just don't know. Got an idea. How about we go make money working on a tuna fishing boat? Ooops. Hey! There goes the Ghost. He's got some disease. Won't live much longer. He should just quit school. Yeah...? Hey man! - Not too much water, now. - Right. You won't graduate at this rate, Yukio. Your grades were always bad, now you've tarnished your record. You're going to prove a disappointment, to your hardworking parents. You must really love school, huh? Ready to join the juniors again next year? What do you want to do? What kind of job do you want? What do you mean, 'hmmm?' What do you want? You want to buy a home? You're young, you have dreams, right? Well...vague dreams. Vague what, exactly? I have hopes for world peace and whatever. You just know he was a cherry tree in his past life. Look who's here. It's fuckin' Slow Mizuguchi. Don't kiss-ass, man. What're you going to do? Work? College? I'm destined to join Ultra Man. That a part-time job? You like school, don't you? Yeah, like this is heaven here. Huh, well, must be hard to figure out your future at that rate. Too bad for you. This is awesome. This is awesome, just awesome. Awesome, it's awesome. Look, it's the dung beetle! Call. Dirty one-suiter, double-double 2 bonuses, I win. You owe me 7000 points. What's the point of winning at mahjong, if we just lose in baseball? That's right. It was my dream. That's right. Going to the nationals was everything to me. Go for the nationals! Don't let it get to you, please. I shouId've pitched that curve, just like the catcher told me. He's always right. That was your best fastball. For real. Hey freshman... if there was one pitch you couldn't take back, you think it'd be possible to... take it back? Huh? With career counselling, just go in and tell 'em what they wanna hear. None of your business. Why've you been skipping the meets? Some of 'em are freaked, think you're chickening out. Boss Mizuguchi likes me, so I'll put in a word for you. So, the boss... He told me to take over this turf next. You can be my right hand man, then. We're gonna take over the turf, man. Hey, what is it, a teacher? No, it's nothing. Nothing my ass, you idiot! Wanna die? Damn, she's waiting out front. You're so useless. Thought you had more guts than this. Gimme a light. Hey can you see me, my heart is broken... l'm creeping into the night... Hey, Yoshimura! What is it? Run to the store and get some Home Run bars! Who's gonna stand watch if he fetches for you? I'll let you in the gang if the bar you buy me's a winner. Yes! Don't be getting ideas, Yukio. You can't recruit him without clearing it with the top. Be a different story if I put in a word, of course. The boss likes me, you know. What are you really looking for? - Just a minute. - Wait... Hey, cutie! I tell you, the boss is amazing. We were cruising the coast the other day, when he spots this guy at a stop staring at us. The guy's in this 50's style, souped-up rider. So he drags him out and beats the shit out of him. The guy's apologizing, but he won't listen. It was crazy, man. Teeth scattered all over the place... And this other time... Where is it really? Mona Lisa, don't you know, Mona Lisa? Hello! Anyone there? You deaf? I said a light. Fire... Wanna die? Huh? You wanna die? Wait, wait, hey...I'm gonna tell the boss, I'll... I'm not choosing ice-cream, I'm choosing my life. In any case, hurry up. They'll all melt pretty soon. Hey, that one's a winner. For sure, that one. What an idiot! That's why you'll always be a gofer. lf I pick a winner, I can join the gang. I'll never have to stand watch or be a gofer again. What do you want to be when you grow up, Yukio? When I grow up? What do you want to be when you grow up? When I grow up... I got the ice-cream bar, Yukio. - Ice-cream bar, huh? - Yes. Keep it. Where's Ohta? Killed him. That's not cool. You got some nerve smoking on campus, Yukio. Are you prepared to face the consequences? Peace. So y equals x squared minus 3... That's the first given... Then...Now stop looking outside... So if that's the given... Let go! I've got exams to take! I said let go! I'm gonna graduate! I'm gonna graduate, dammit! Let go! Let go! Let go! Wait, wait, wait! Hey, hey, hey, Yukio! - Where're you taking Yukio?! - OK, now calm down... We understand, yes, yes... OK, now don't move... Yukio! Hey, Yukio! Wait, Yukio! Wait! Hey, Yukio! Wait, hey! Yukio! Where you going? Hey, Kimura. Hey, hello. Your hair's grown. Yes. Had enough of school? Well, running with the yakuza isn't easy either, is it Mr Suyiki? My uniform never looked that good on me. I'd been having diarrhoea since this morning, so I took a shit on my teacher's desk. Heard you lost. Yes, losing's all we do now. Wanna join up? Good timing, sir. - You keep this. - Right. You'd better make it to the nationals and get it back. Get what back? My youth. I promise! Staked my whole youth on baseball, my only goal the nationals. In this shit-hole of a school, baseball was my only flower. I staked my life on my bat, my dreams on my pitches. Watch me make the spirit of baseball bloom. In the midst of the roaring crowd, a glimpse of my mother's face. Even to a fool like me, she's always given her love, always ready to smile. I love you so much for that. Even if my body is broken, and all my tears and sweat dry up, my dream remains, The Nationals. No regrets for my youth. Loser. Kujo, did you hear? Yukio stabbed and killed Ohta. Kujo, you listening? Yoshimura. Man, he's changed. - Good morning. - Right. Not! It's gotten awful lonely around here. Not really. Still plenty of fools around. He scares me. Scares you? People who know what they want, scare me. How you doing? Baseball players wanted All right! Asa High, let's go, let's go, let's go! Asa High, let's go, let's go, let's go! Asa High, let's go, let's go, let's go! Asa High, let's go, let's go, let's go! Asa High, let's go, let's go, let's go! Asa High, let's go, let's go, let's go! Here comes Asa High... C'mon, there, go! Hey, Kujo, did you hear Leo clapped 7 times? That punk's taking us for fools. We gotta clamp down and show them. How do we face that murderer Yukio and yakuza Kimura now? With those two gone, they've gotten way out of line. C'mon Kujo. Leo, was it? Uh-huh. So you clapped 7 times? Um, I'm not trying to defy you or anything... Chill out man. I know you want to beat me and act cool. One! All right! All right! Two! Three! Just imagine there's a pool behind us and it's not so scary. Too cold for swimming. Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Scared? Whatever, shut up! No way. You can't do it. It's too far. Scared, right? Shut up! Be quiet! You're not up to it. Nine! Mom! Help me, I'm gonna fall! Help me! Ow, stop it, cut it out! Leo, who the hell do you think you are, huh? Die, fucker! You punk ass! You pierced bitch! Die! Die, you fucker! I'll kill you! Die, you bitch, die! Kujo, where you going? We're not done with him yet. Stop leaning on me for everything. You can handle the juniors yourself. Who the fuck are you! So the range of y equals 2 + 3 over x + 1... Since the value of x is higher than the straight line, y equals x + 3... I'm sure everyone's got the answer already as it's common sense. The value of x should be this...-1 So in exercise 1, answer the following question, by using the function 'y equals x + 1 divided by 2 x 3'. Sorry about yesterday - Aoki This graph of the function and the straight line y equals x + 3... Hey! Kujo, Kujo, late again? It's the Always Late Kujo, late again. Anyway, back to class... Kujo, sorry about yesterday. I said sorry. Let's go to the store, huh? The store right? Hey, Kujo... In this case, x + 1 + 2... do you all understand? So as you can see in this graph... Aoki, Aoki... Look, Kujo, Aoki's going somewhere... Aoki. Okey dokey, there goes the low key Aoki... Anyway, back to class... Hey, Baba! Baba! Hey, Aoki. Go and buy me some Home Run bars. What? You chicken shit... You're Kujo's gofer, right? I'm buddies with Kujo, so c'mon... Who's Kujo? He's just a condescending fucker! Aoki? Wait, Hori... My eyes... I can't see. Hori. Get outta here. No, seriously. What shouId I do? This is bad. - Really? - Yeah. Don't! Mom gave me that to buy books with. I need to buy comic books. Please, give it back... - Hurry your ass up. - Let me go! - C'mon move it. - What the hell... In a heavy rain of stars. You run towards the sky. The beating of the night sky. Yay! Home run! Raspberry baby. Raspberry baby. Come next to me. Let's go on a lonely merry-go-round. It's so beautiful, you're so excited. Raspberry baby. Raspberry baby. Raspberry baby. Raspberry baby. Baby, let's go... A faint light shines on you... I want to be in yesterday's cold rain... Black limousine...Black limousine drive Black limousine...Black limousine drive Black limousine...Black limousine drive Black limousine...Black limousine... Black limousine drive A faint light shines on you, the harbour's in sight. I want to be in yesterday's cold rain... Aoki's Turf See page 131, I want you now to pay particular attention, this is very important. It was Tokugawa Ieyasu, the head of Gotairou, who took control of the Government, after Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Who the fuck do you think you are! Stop talking shit! Who put you in charge! What're you talking about? Die, asshole! Leave if you don't like it here! I Iove it here, you asshole! Then stay til you die! I'll make it hell on earth! You can't do it! I can do what you can't! - Hello. - Hi. Um, would you happen to be... affiliated with a senior here named Aoki? What in hell? What school you from? School? This is my school. Falcon. Sorry, I'm not getting this. You look stupid anyway. - Falcon? What the.. - It's an international school with... International or whatever, who cares? This is Japan, - and this is our school. - True. I mean, what's with this bike anyway? What color is this? Aoki, I got the Home Run...bars... If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. If you're happy and you know it, and you really want to show it, If you're happy and you know it clap your hands. My dream was to become a pilot. Are you OK? Just take it slow, real slow. Be careful. OK? Is Aoki your friend? Or an ex-friend? People change when they change. Yes Something you're born with. Can't be helped. The flowers are dried up. They'll bloom again. But all flowers dry up... I'm thinking of... quitting school. You watering them everyday? Teacher, aren't there some flowers that never bloom? Flowers are meant to bloom, not to dry up. That's what I choose to believe. It's a very important thing. Kujo. I'm going home. Take care. Morning! Good morning! Good morning! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! This is your new classmate, Kujo. Everyone be nice to him, OK? I'm Aoki. Nice to meet you! Uh, thanks. Let's play dodge ball. It's no fun just watching. OK. 13 claps: Aoki Six! Kujo, take me with you, please? Aoki! 1! 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11, 12, 13...!
