I will not be proud of this biography. There will be no cause of pride, nor will it be the absolute truth. I cannot remember, or desire to remember that well. So, being just a human being, I will try, although I know that I cannot to justify myself through this summary. Hey, my love, is Mel there? I think he's sleeping on the couch. So you better wake him up. This is Mel. Mel... breaking into the Poolroom. Come out here. Hey... come here. Yes, sir. Do you know anything about that? Do you know Clarence Earl Gideon? Yes. I saw him leave with a bottle of wine. Then he made a phone call, around the corner. And he waited for a taxi to pick him up. How long has that been? A little while ago... it was about half past five. Four bottles of wine, twelve bottles of soda, twelve cans of beer. How much money did you say is gone? About $5 from the cigarette machine and $60 from the jukebox, all of 50, 10 and 20 coins. Did you call for me? Mr Cobb did. What is the trouble, Mr Cobb? Did you catch anyone around here, 5:30 in the morning? Yes, sir. And who was it? Clarence Earl Gideon. Where did you leave him? What's the problem? Yeah... he asked... if anybody asked, I didn't see him. Ah... ah... Where did you leave him? Clarence, I need to talk to you about the poolroom case. What about poolroom? Bay Harbour... Didn't you go in there and steal the coins from the record player and the cigarette machine? No sir. I don't. I don't know what you're talking about. Do you... have anything in your pockets? Come on, come on, empty it here, let me see... Finish your beer. Tampa, State of Florida, against Clarence Earl Gideon August 4, 1961 Is the State prepared to take this case to trial? The State is prepared, Your Honour. Defence ready? I am not prepared, Your Honour. Why aren't you prepared? Ah... I don't have a lawyer. Why not? Didn't you know that your case would be tried today? Yes, sir, I knew. So, why didn't you get a lawyer and prepare for the trial? Ah... I have no money... I don't have a cent... I want you to nominate someone who can represent me... Come on, come on, come on Mr Gideon... I can't understand what you're saying. I don't understand, the clerk didn't understand it either. Come on... Now, repeat what you said, so that we can understand, please I want you to appoint a lawyer to represent me at this trial. Ah... Mr Gideon, I am sorry, but I cannot appoint counsel to represent you in this case. Under the laws of the State of Florida, the only time the Court can appoint counsel to represent a defendant is when that person is charged with a capital offence... I'm entitled to a lawyer. Let the record, show that the defendant asked the Court to appoint a lawyer to represent him at the trial and the Court denied the request, and informed the accused that the only time the Court would appoint a lawyer to represent a defendant it would be in the event that the defendant was charged with a capital offence. Now, I'll ask the jury... if you will give Mr Gideon the same fair trial in consideration that they would give if he was represented by a lawyer since you're not? Now, Mr Gideon, you can go back to your place. You can make your opening statement, Mr Harris. The State will prove that, on June 3, 1961, Clarence Earl Gideon unlawfully and feloniously broke into and invaded someone else's establishment, that is, Bay Harbour Poolroom, with the intention of committing a misdemeanour within that establishment that is, a petty larceny. The State will prove this beyond reasonable doubt, through the testimony of eyewitnesses. Mister Gideon... Come on, get closer... You can address the jury... Stay here where you can see them, and say what you hope the evidence will prove in your favour. Speak loudly so they can hear you. I didn't do it and the evidence will show that... I had nothing to do with it. Start, Mr Harris. The state calls Lester Wade. Lester Wade. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, with God's help? Yes, sir, I swear. You can testify. Say your name and address, please. Lester Wade, West Avenue, 108, Panama City, Florida. Mr Wade, where were you, at 5:30 am, last June 3rd? I was outside the Bay Harbour Poolroom. Say what you observed. I saw Clarence Earl Gideon inside the poolroom. Do you see him now? Yes, sir. Point it at the court, please. Let the record show he indicated the defendant. And what else did you see? Well, I was watching him inside the poolroom through the window for a few minutes. Then I saw him leave with a bottle of wine in his hand. He made a call on the corner, then he took the taxi that he called. Well, what did you do then? Then I went back to the poolroom and saw that it had been stolen. Specifically, what did you see? Ah, it was the front... the front of the cigarette machine was torn off and the coin box was on the empty pool table. The witness is yours. Mr Wade, what were you doing outside the poolroom, at 5:30 in the morning? I had just arrived from a dance down Apalachicola, ah... I stayed out all night... Have you never been arrested? Objection. Sustained. Ah... what can I ask him? About whether he was never arrested? You may ask if you have never been convicted of a crime. Have you never been convicted of a crime? No sir. Are you absolutely sure I was carrying a bottle of wine? Yes, sir, I know you were. And how do you know? Because I saw it in your hand. Do you have any more questions for the witness, Mr Gideon? I think not... The witness may step down. Mr Gideon, please go back to your seat. Mr Stafford, do you operate the Bay Harbour Poolroom? Yes, sir. Tell us what you know of the events of the early morning of June 3rd, 1961. Well, I closed the poolroom around midnight. I locked all the doors and windows. And when I came back the next morning, at seven o'clock, the deputy was there. Somebody smashed the window and broken in the cigarette machine and the jukebox and took all the money. Was there anything other than money missing? A small amount of beer and some wine. It's your witness. Is your name Leo Stafford? That's right. And you run Bay Harbour Poolroom? That's right. Describe it. It's poolroom... it has pool tables... and also a bar... Describe the bar part of it. It's a long bar, right in the middle of the room. It's just a bar. Well, you are excused. You may step down. The State has no more witnesses, Your Honour. Mr Gideon do you have any witnesses you wish to call? My landlady, Mrs Edna Curtis. Dona Edna Curtis. Left hand on the Bible, and raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, with God's help? - I swear. - Sit down. Mrs Curtis. You own the Bay Harbour Hotel, opposite the poolroom, and I live there, don't I? Yes, you do. When I want to make a phone call, at night, I use the hotel phone, or I cross the street... I protest, Your Honour. He's leading the witness. You cross the street to use the public phone... so as not to disturb others... you're very considerate. Thank you. During the time that I lived in the hotel, Did you ever see me drunk? No. And you had me as a drunk? No. Did you ever hear that I got drunk? No. Thank you, Ms Curt, I appreciate your testimony, that's all. I have no questions for the witness, Your Honour. Any more witnesses, Mister Gideon? Not in the moment. This is your only chance. If you want to call any more witnesses, you have to call now. If not, it's time for the final arguments for the jury. Mr Gideon, the DA's office speaks first. Gentlemen of the jury. You heard from the eyewitnesses that the poolroom were broken into sometime in the early morning of June 3rd. And that the accused Mr Gideon was seen inside, alone at that time. He was seen coming out with a bottle of wine in his hands. And then he called a taxi, which took him away from the scene of his crime. I think you'll all agree that the state has proved its case, beyond any reasonable doubt. Now Mr Gideon. Gentlemen of the jury. You've heard witnesses from both sides at this trial. And you had a chance to hear them. I want to say to you right now that I didn't do what they said I did. I also want to remind you that the law says I am innocent until proven guilty. The law is absolutely clear on this point. That's all and thank you very much. In order to find the defendant guilty, you must determine that the crime was committed in Bay County within the last two years and by Mr Gideon. You can all go out and start the deliberation now. What do you think? It is hard to say. Good luck. Do you call this a fair trial? It is the biggest injustice I have ever seen from Chesapeake to Ohio. You seemed very sincere. This is important. I believed in you. And I bet the jury did too. I... should... have a lawyer... yeah... I asked for... At least... Did I ask you the right questions? I thought you did. I needed to show that I was not a bum. I never... break into a place just to steal wine and beer. And you, knowing me as you know me, never having seen me drunk, I think this must have helped, I don't know. I'm sure they've all seen it. A lawyer would do better. I was caught again, you know, a few years ago, before I moved to the hotel... for something I didn't do They didn't give me a lawyer that time either. They left me in jail two months without a hearing. Two months. That was when my wife and I broke up. As in social work. I was told that the boys were already being well looked after, I was in jail, and she was working there, how could they be? So they took the boys and interned in an orphanage No one needs to tell me that I have not been the best father in the world. But this time I can take 6 months... a year until... The judges are coming back. So early? You will have to leave, lady. It is not allowed to sit here. Get up. Sit down. Deliver the verdict to the officer, please. The defendant wants to get up. Clarence Earl Gideon, you were found guilty by the jury. I have given them a report on your past, Mr Gideon. It is said that you have been in prison four times, three times for theft and one for seizing government property. Is correct? Yes, sir. Do you have anything to say before the Court passes the sentence? No sir. Clarence Earl Gideon, I condemn you to be confined at the State Penitentiary in Reikford the maximum period prescribed by law for this offence: five years. You are now inmates at Reikford State Prison. Some have been here before and know what is expected of you. Others were not. They will have their clothes sterilised. Have your assets checked. They will cut their hair and be disinfected. We hope you all cooperate. This means do not speak and follow instructions. If a guard says "move," you will jump. When you go to a guard, they will say "Sir" and will be subject to all Florida Correctional Division regulations and laws. Put the clothes you want in one of those bags and here those who want to donate to charity. And you will go there to be photographed, take fingerprints and take a shower And without conversation. Don't be impressed. Hey you. Are you deaf? Are you blind? No. No what? I am neither deaf nor blind. Turn there. After the float, they will take you to the Vocational Guidance Centre. In short, what will happen is this. A free man will come in, dressed in a suit, White shirt, will measure your IQ, ask what jobs do you want... wish for anything, as long as it's in here, you're not crazy about wanting to work on a farm in the hot sun, are you? What are you going to do? I go to the workshop, I am auto mechanic, repair generators, batteries and things like that... They always need a good mechanic. I don't know how to do any of that... Ah, ah... in that case, you go to the sector where the ancients rule us who are not qualified. That's when you're going to have to be brave for real. I got 40 years old for armed robbery. How long it will stay? Yeah... I still don't know. Are you in charge here? Exactly. I want to see everything you have about human rights... the rights of a man to be tried. Everything, really? You might be interested in about 200 years... They are there, in the second corridor. Can I take the books? It depends on where you want to take... One at a time. Sign here. Opens after dinner? Only if someone asks me. I wanted to come back after dinner. So I think I'll open it. 64712, report to the infirmary. 64712, report to the infirmary. Hey, boy. Which is? Yeah... let's fight for a cigarette on your arm... No, I don't want to dispute anything... Come, fight with both hands if you want... Hey, grandpa... What the hell are you doing? Hey. Charles from the library said you're trying to get your sentence suspended. Is it because they didn't give you a lawyer? Do you think there's anything there? "No state will deprive anyone of life, property or freedom, without due process... It is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. I asked for a lawyer, and they didn't give it to me. It means that I was deprived of my freedom, without the legal process. Was it true for me because I didn't have a lawyer either? I went to cane just like you. What will they have to do if you win? What are they going to have to do? Release you? Perhaps... Yeah... but I still have to read a lot... Even if you were guilty? I didn't do that. I know. But, what if it was? Even so, he would be entitled to a lawyer. They can't put you in jail, without giving you a fair trial. My God. How is it going? Good... Great. Here, take a cigarette. Come on, take some. Come on, put it in your pocket. How are you reading? Were you at the library today? Not yet. You go there later, don't you? It's... only when it's over. It's great. Then, when you leave the library, maybe we can talk? About what? Now, about my judgement. What do you think, huh? Hey... why don't you get out and let him work? For you to give him 3 cents / hour, right? Later? Hey, Gideon, how is it going? I have a few things to do. First, a petition to the Court and still do a habeas corpus... then ask the United States Supreme Court to issue a certification order... certiorari... then I need to sign a declaration that I can't even pay $100 for the costs it's a petition... in forma pauperis... Yeah... the other guys are already getting hopeful... Ah... You know, I've seen a lot of petitions to the Supreme Court written in this room. I wrote a couple myself. None of them were accepted? Been here for two months, and everyone thinks you are Moses, who came to live in the promised land. Yeah... maybe it's... Ah... is there a typewriter here? Do not. The law says Supreme Court petitions must be typed, "That if possible". I do not believe that they are against you, if you write by hand. Clarence. Can I have a look, a minute? Kemp? Ah, Mr President. Don't get up, don't get up. In 15 minutes, I will be ready for our tour. Is it okay for you? President, do you have a minute? Ah... 15 minutes. A petition from a Florida prisoner has just arrived, who claims to have asked the local court to grant you a lawyer at your trial, and they didn't grant it. Is there a special circumstance? Illiterate? Incompetent? No sir. Complex charge against him? No sir... break-in with the intention of committing a small theft. Betts against Brady... He's out of luck... unless he can demonstrate special circumstances or disadvantage. We decided that 20 years ago. He's not claiming any special circumstances He just says that, according to the Constitution, a poor man is entitled to have a lawyer to help you in your defence. He's asking us to change our minds, my son. Yes, sir. Yeah, it looks like we do this every 20 years... Tell the court clerk to write to the State of Florida, requesting information. This will clarify the legal issues, informing us of the underlying facts. Then write a memo to the Ministers. We will resolve in conference, as with any other certiorari petition. Yes, sir. Thank you sir. Thank you, Arthur. Thirteen minutes. Good day sir. Good Morning. This morning, Today we have 2 resources, asking us to admit his calls, 26 certiorari petitions, 10 petitions from the poor, and 3 petitions for a new hearing. So, I would like to start. Can we start with the case for the right to freedom in Louisiana? I believe that we must not only grant the petition for review, as well as revoking convictions for lack of sufficient evidence... Since now. I agree. Six blacks convicted of order violation at the Shreedow Port bus station for attempted discrimination. The only thing they did wrong was to violate the practise of segregation and this practise is constitutionally unacceptable. Somebody else? How many approve the review and answer the request for review? And how many revoke the conviction now? Gideon versus Cochran. Here it is clear that we are being questioned... Is it time to take Betts and Brady down? Well, although I can imagine that what I will say will be a big shock to everyone here... could I start? I never thought it wasn't time to overturn that unfortunate decision. I voted against Betts before and I'm happy to have lived long enough, to take another bite of the apple. The truth of the matter is that I never harboured the slightest suspicion, this time at least, that I was wrong. The rule on which Betts is founded established that a lawyer is constitutionally required only if it is practised against someone a denial of a fundamental right. We understand that the flexibility of the principle would protect us. I felt it before, and I feel it now, that we need an absolute rule. The right to a lawyer may not be considered essential in some countries for a fair trial, but in ours, it is. And I think there is a considerable danger in formulating inflexible laws if there are no qualitative factors to justify them, and then impose those laws on states against their will. It was what we decided twenty years ago. And I still consider it a very valid approach: flexibility. Well, I consider myself a flexible man in most cases, but not about the rights of an accused citizen. I have a basic difficulty about the problem. We must anticipate the prerogatives of Florida courts and, especially, to its legislators? If they believe that everyone is entitled to a lawyer, what they are going to pay for, so let them speak. What if they don't think so? What if they decide not to pay for them? What will happen to Gideon? Who will he ask for protection? I read his petition. He seems to have medium intelligence. He could defend himself without a lawyer. Properly, no. And when is someone entitled to a lawyer? So who is arrested? When is it processed? When are you on trial? And are we going to talk about practical consequences? How many prisoners are there in this country at the moment who have no lawyer? Are many... Ah... ah... ah... And if we're going to decree now that Gideon's trial was unfair, so theirs went too. What will we do about it? Order a new trial for each of them? I would like to return to Mister Gideon. The other side had a lawyer. Was it fair that he didn't? That's not the question? Very well. This was a very simple case: break-in with the intention of committing a small theft. And even a very simple man, assuming Mr Gideon is a simple man, and it's not safe to assume that completely. Gentlemen, even a simple man can defend himself in a simple case... But is it fair? Is it fundamentally fair? Small theft may have been. But a small sentence was not. These are all extremely important issues that can be decided, if we know of the petition. Is there anyone in favour of knowing the case? Clarence, Clarence. Hey, Clarence. Two letters arrived for you from the Supreme Court. Two cards. You heard? Yes, I heard. Did correspondence arrive for me? Is it resolved? Gideon versus Cochran. Motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and the petition for certiorari warrant were granted. It is necessary that you immediately send a signed petition, asking the Court to appoint a lawyer to represent him. It is necessary that you immediately send a signed petition, asking the Court to appoint a lawyer to represent him. It just means that they agreed to listen to me. But we still have to win. The question is very simple. I asked the Court to appoint a lawyer for me and the Court refused. Is it a simple matter, Mrs Lawrence? I didn't understand, Mr Fortas. Mr Gideon says the question is very simple. Gives the Constitution entitles a poor man, accused of crime, of having a lawyer by your side? Does that mean she doesn't? Do not. But if you're asking me, Mr Fortas, no question about the law is very simple... That's exactly why Mr Gideon needed a lawyer in the first place. I want to congratulate you, sir, on being nominated to represent Gideon. Thanks. John, I am counting on you to help me prove my thesis. Abel will search and work with me to prepare the instruction Jim, you will do research and John will help you until you return to the University. I want a memo about how state law has changed regarding the appointment of a lawyer over the years. In real terms, how many accused of crime go to trial without a lawyer. If the Constitution now effectively guarantees a lawyer for all cases. What are the additional demands of lawyers? I want your opinions about the suggest about the standardisation of the case, because we are arguing that citizens, even if accused of minor infractions, should have lawyers... Some ministers will not be easy to convince... perhaps we should restrict ourselves only to cases of more serious crimes... The Supreme Court asked me to support that everyone has the right to a lawyer... But I don't represent all people; I represent only Clarence Earl Gideon. If I can get you out of prison on any pretext, or show that there were special circumstances that justified the presence of a lawyer insanity, incompetence or whatever... We cannot conclude from the file, but maybe Gideon is a black man, I could argue that in the South, a black man does not have the same treatment as a white man. If I can get him out of the law anyway, isn't this my first obligation to Gideon? Without a doubt, Abe. Few things displease Supreme Court ministers than a lawyer who puts aside his client's interests, in their zeal to make some major change in the law. It would be an anticlimax, if I released Gideon, without establishing a new case law that recognised the right to a lawyer... But I will find out if there were any special circumstances. Add that, please, to my letter to Gideon: For my convenience, I would be very satisfied if you send me a careful and detailed biographical description when and where you were born, education, occupation, family, detentions and any other information that may occur to you. I want to emphasise that it is not absolutely necessary, but it will only serve to give me some more basis. I know that you will be extremely careful and send me with absolute precision any information that may interest me. My mother was very strict... My... My life as a child was strictly disciplined. My parents had the best moral customs and they were members of the local Baptist Church, which I joined when I was about 13 years old. My mother to this day has never done anything that could be wrongly classified. My brother and sister are also good-natured people. I suppose I am what is called an individualist, a person who does not behave. Anyway, my parents were always fighting, I was the scapegoat for these fights. At 14, I decided to run away from home. My mum found out where I was and picked me up. She sent me to a correctional prison, and I managed to escape from there. It was terribly cold, and shortly after, I stole some clothes from a local store. But I was caught the next day, still dressed, by the store owner. My mother asked the judge to send me to the reformatory, where I stayed for a period of 3 years. Of all the prisons I've been to, this was the worst. I still have scars on my body from the lashes I received there... Anyway, I got parole after a year, I was then 16 years old... So, Gideon is not black... he is not illiterate... and he is certainly not insane. The judge not only had no prejudice against him, but tried to help him defend himself. He didn't do a very good job, but it wasn't his role to be a defence attorney. All of this makes this case perfect for challenging the best decision. Without special circumstances, only Gideon was entitled to ask for a lawyer, because he was accused of a crime, just as anyone in the country, accused of a crime, would have the right to a lawyer... And that is how we will debate the case. But I would like to say to the ministers the following: we will not speak, we will go down to the prisoners and watch how they defend themselves... Sorry if I couldn't write better. I did my best. Me, Clarence Earl Gideon, I hereby come to ask Your Excellency to allow me to read with my You don't mind if we talk a little about my judgement, do you? Of course not. I... it... happened... a long time ago. I don't remember the main points well... Well, we'll see that later. Ok? What's the problem? If I win the case, will they have to let me out? What do you mean? Can they judge me for the same thing again... this time with a lawyer? I do not know. What will you do if you win? First, you may have to be tried again for the same charge, this time with a lawyer. Can they do that? Do not know. I am studying this now. They're rascals... I still need to fight in court for my children. I received a letter. They go to court, to try to get them out of me. But I have news for the court. They don't know who they're messing with. I do not know. If I had a home of my own and could take care of them, and get a job as a mechanic, somewhere, or I could open a workshop, to work on one car at a time... Who will argue for the State of Florida? His name is Jacob. Do you know what I find interesting? In a common criminal case, the state has all the advantages, but now, at the Supreme Court, Gideon has Abe Fortas on his side, plus you and me, And the State of Florida has a young assistant prosecutor who must never have set foot in this room. This time, things got even. Don't start feeling sorry for the miserable, until we win... The most honourable Minister President and the Ministers of the Supreme Court of the United States. Listen, listen, listen... Anyone who has matters for the United States Supreme Court, are urged to approach and dedicate their attention, because the Court is now settling in and taking a seat. God save the United States and its exalted Court. Number 1-55, Clarence Earl Gideon pleading, versus H.G. Cochran Jr., Director of the Florida State Correctional Division. Attorney present. Mr Fortas. Mr President of this Court of Justice, I hope you will like the Court. This case presents a delicate problem, without the contest of irrelevant facts. Clarence Earl Gideon is supposed to have broken into Bay Harbour Poolroom and stolen, yes, some cigarettes and an unsettled amount of money. He was arrested and put on trial. He asked the judge to appoint a lawyer to defend him, and the judge refused. So Gideon did his best to defend himself. He was sentenced to 5 years and sent to the Penitentiary. The case file does not indicate that Gideon was a person of low intelligence, nor was the judge arbitrary with him. But for me, this case demonstrates the basic difficulty of Betts versus Brady. It shows that no man, however intelligent, can properly conduct his own defence. But that's not the point, is it, Mr Fortas? In the Betts case, this Court did not support the assumption that a man can defend himself without a lawyer, like anyone. It was not? Everyone knows not. I fully agree, Minister, with the point to which you refer, that a man cannot get a fair trial without a lawyer. But the Betts case established that this consideration it should be less valued than the demands of federalism. In other words, the Betts case expressed the understanding that this Court had at the time, that the State of Florida or any other State is responsible for deciding for itself whether defendants, before the courts, should have the right to counsel, and the Supreme Court should not impose this requirement on them. But Minister, this Court has often held that, when there are special circumstances, the accused has the right to the lawyer that the court chooses, and now, to all the debates on legal issues, to start with this famous 1942 case, that fascinating question. And when I read the vows of this Court. I hope to be forgiven... I will say that my heart was filled with compassion for the judges, who had to review those records and look for special circumstances that would give the defendant the right to a lawyer... Such a review by the Supreme Court on a case-by-case basis of state court decisions cannot be sound. The intervention must be in the least abrasive and least corrosive manner possible. It is clear that the special circumstance approach is wrong. How can a judge, when a man is prosecuted, look at him and say "there are special circumstances"? A judge says, "You look ignorant"... or "does your case involve complex facts"? It is administratively impractical. States are recognising this. Some are, Minister. Professor Kandy Sage's research indicates that 37 states they now provide lawyers for poor people in all cases for the most serious crimes. Another 8 currently do the same with material practises. And 5 do not grant the lawyer except in capital cases. But, with due respect, I do not agree with the implication in your question that the fact that States act on their own would be an argument against the Supreme Court taking a step forward now. I believe that the growing acceptance of the right to lawyers by States makes it easier to reinterpret the Constitution. I see that my time is almost up. So, I'll be succinct. I believe that this case dramatically illustrates that you cannot have due process without a lawyer. Under our justice system, how can our civilised nation claim that there is a fair trial, without a lawyer to accuse, doing everything he can, within the limits of decency, and a lawyer to defend, doing their utmost, within the same limits? And from this conflict, the truth will emerge. I think there is a tendency to forget what happens to these poor people, miserable and destitute, people who live like that until they die... Sometimes, in this Court, there is a tendency to forget what goes on down there. I remembered Clarence Earl the other night, examining another case of someone who was prosecuted for trying to bribe a jury. The first thing this person imagined was that he needed a lawyer. He, who was one of the greatest criminal lawyers in this country. But, Mr Fortas, what are the limits of what you are asking for? At what stage of a criminal case should a lawyer be provided? And what kind of cases? Only in this case? No, sir, not in this case. But I will give my opinion... Attorney must be offered at least from the first sentence of the prisoner, also in your trial and appeal. And that right should be extended to all defendants. Even for traffic violations? Even in traffic crimes... I know it sounds strange, but it would work. Only an exceptional situation would prevent it. And it would be very easy to tell him, Yes, sir, come through that door, at the end of the corridor is the office of the public defender, he will be received. Thank you, Mr President. Doctor Jacob. Mr President. May I please the Court. Clarence Earl Gideon had a fair trial. The lawsuit shows that he took an active part in his own defence, and he had a great deal of skill and ease in interrogating witnesses. Its previous record of 4 criminal arrests also indicates that a criminal case was not entirely foreign to him. Judge Mc Claric, who tried the case, said, and I quote, that in his opinion, quotes, Gideon showed mental capacity and experience in court in previous trials to properly conduct your defence. He acted just as most lawyers would have done in conducting this case. I close the quotes. We were asked to debate today whether the decision of this Court, in Betts versus Brady, it must be revoked or modified. We maintain that it should not, for several reasons. First, there is no historical basis for requiring states to automatically appoint a lawyer in all cases. Second, the criterion in Betts v. Brady provides a clear and consistent pattern to determine when a lawyer is entitled. There are special circumstances that are not present in the case, such as an illiterate or young prisoner. How do you know that? What are the special circumstances? Every time this Court decides a case, we are aware of another special circumstance. Not long ago, in 4 cases, I believe, we overruled your State's decisions where the accused were not entitled to a lawyer due to special circumstances... We prefer to check case by case. It may not be very accurate. But we prefer, This is because it gives the State freedom to dictate its own laws in criminal proceedings. This Court has never established permanent rules on the right to counsel. And the Scarborough case? Does it not establish a rule in which lawyers are required in capital cases? It was decided that way, based on circumstances. Perhaps. But subsequent cases have made it clear that there is a permanent rule for capital cases. Your argument that we heard does not face that. What historical precedents did you find for the distinction between capital and non-capital cases? Excellency, I don't remember any. Me neither. That's why I asked. There is a practical distinction between capital and non-capital cases, if you want to draw a line. Everyone is afraid of being put to death. Perhaps they are afraid to spend years in the Penitentiary too... I would like to quote one of our basic theses. Recognising the presence of special circumstances, this Court may order the State to appoint lawyers. However, imposing an inflexible rule that every accused is entitled to a lawyer in all cases, we think that this Court would be meddling in an area historically reserved for States. It would stifle the experimentation of the State. For example, a state can eliminate both the prosecutor and the defence attorney, and leave the entire judgement to the judge... Don't go too far now... Listen. Gideon is not a lawyer. But you say that he is capable of representing himself. Do you also think he would be allowed to represent other defendants? If any accused asks, I am sure the judge will not object. But the Bar Association maybe... I hope that this Court will consider the consequences of the repeal of Betts v. Brady... serious consequences, in my view. The new doctrine of granting a lawyer every time you are asked would necessarily be extended to the most trivial cases, creating a tremendous burden for the taxpayer. What would happen next? Indigents would also be demanding other free services afterwards... psychiatrists, technical expertise assistants and things like that... Strictly speaking, this Court would be demanding that the State adopt the socialism or social assistance program... And please consider this too: of 7,800 convicted now in Florida prisons, more than 5,000 were tried without a lawyer, and perhaps they will be released, if this Court annuls Betts v. Brady. If this Court revokes that precedent, we implore you to find a way, a way of not making it retroactive. We have been following Betts in good faith... And are some of those 5,000 Florida prisoners illiterate? Excellency, I have no way of knowing this... No, but what do you think? Yeah, I don't know, but I suppose some of them are illiterate. This Court established that an illiterate defendant is entitled to a lawyer. Even under Betts v. Brady, illiteracy is a special circumstance. Any illiterate, within the 5,000 prisoners, was stripped of his constitutional rights. Doctor Fortas, would you like to say something in reply? Mr President, in 1942, when Betts v. Brady was decided, this country was at war with Hitler's Germany. Benjamin V. Cohen, the famous New Deal lawyer, and Lee M. Griswold were professors and then deans from Harvard Law School, Both referred to this when they sent this letter to the New York Times, criticising the Betts v. Brady. I quote: "The decision at Betts v. Brady arrives at a singularly inopportune moment. Men are struggling around the world to free themselves from fear of political trials and concentration camps. Through this struggle, men have the hope that the bill of rights will emerge, which will guarantee everyone certain fundamental rights. Most American lawyers and lay people, before the decision in Betts v. Brady, would have thought that the accused's right to counsel in a serious criminal case, it was arguably a part of our own Bill of Rights. For in the free world, no man should be sentenced to criminal servitude for years, without having the right to a lawyer to defend him. The right to a lawyer, for both the poor and the rich man, it is an indispensable safeguard of freedom and justice according to the law." Dim Pound said the law must be stable; however, it should not be paralysed. I think Betts v. Brady was a mistake when it was decided. I think time has made that clear. And now that time has made the right rule possible, the civilised rule, the rule of American constitutionalism, the rule of due process of the law, must be established by this Court. Clarence... a call for you, Mr Fortas. In my office. You can complete the call now. Doctor Fortas? Clarence Earl Gideon. Oh, doctor... It's just wonderful... ah... my congratulations to you, doctor... you... you are a very brilliant man... Can you tell me what the vote was? Ah... it makes me feel really, really good... Doctor Fortas, I was told that I will be tried again... but I don't understand... wouldn't it be a double risk? I have the impression that yes: two trials for the same offence. Ah... I know. Maybe I understand better after I receive your letter, but... I still don't think it's fair. Ah, another thing, sir. Can I ask you What will happen to the others here, who didn't have a lawyer? Yeah, I think I understand... It depends on the circumstances... Ah, can I ask you about this friend of mine? He's been here for 23 years... there was only one witness against him, and that witness is dead now. Another thing: he doesn't know how to read. Yeah... doctor, I'm really grateful... I hope to meet you someday... I thank you so much... thanks. You're going out... That's what my lawyer said. I'm on trial again. I don't know why... isn't it a double risk? I don't know why. I must tell you, I never imagined that there was a single possible chance. What was the vote? Nine to zero... unanimous. How extraordinary. Did he say what will happen to the other boys? He said it's too early to say... Some will be tried again, like me, and with a lawyer, and others may come out like Harles... it depends... At least no one will ever go to trial in this country without a lawyer. That's what he said. Mister Gideon, I'm Tobias Simon... and this is Wim Block, a very experienced criminal lawyer. I'm from the American Civil Liberties Union and I want to congratulate you. His determination and courage are an inspiration to all of us. Well then, Abe Fortas wrote to me saying that you expect the Union to provide you with a lawyer for your retrial. There can be no retrial. I will never have to submit to it again. The 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America says... that no person will be twice subjected to endangering life or freedom, for the same offence. It's a double risk. Mr Gideon... The retrial made to a prisoner as a result of the trial of his own appeal it is not considered a doubled risk under American law. I don't need a lawyer to tell me what my rights are. Where do you intend to make the new trial? In Panama City... Ah... ah... not that. I cannot be judged in that city. I will be condemned again, again. Mr Block and I will do everything we can to make sure that it doesn't happen again. No sir. And with the same judge? Probably. And do you think it would be a fair trial? I'm sorry. I believe that we have no choice in this matter. I notice that Mr Tobias Simon has signed some applications and is presenting himself as a defence attorney. No he's not. Your Honour, can we get closer? Yes, they can. I did not authorise Mr Simon to sign anything for me. I can sign it myself. I don't want him to represent me. Do you want another lawyer to represent you? No, I am not prepared for the trial. But, and what do you want? I want to file an appeal to withdraw my case from this court. I cannot have a fair trial in this court. The same Court, the same judge, the same people, and everything... I cannot get a fair trial here. Excuse me, Your Honour. Your Honour, of course, Mr Block and I don't want to represent Mr Gideon if he doesn't want to... I can speak perfectly for myself. I make my own claims. I don't want anyone to claim anything for me. Don't you want Mr Block and Mr Simon to represent you? I don't want them. Mr Block and Mr Simon are excused. Thanks. Thank you, Your Honour. Mr Gideon, under no circumstances do I want you to plead your own case again. Do you have the money to hire a lawyer of your choice? Do not. But do you know a local lawyer... someone you want to represent you? Yes, Fred Turner. Record in the file: I will appoint Mr Fred Turner to represent this accused, Clarence Earl Gideon. Your Honour, because of Mr Gideon's victory in the Supreme Court, as you know, the State of Florida just passed the public defender's law... I do not want it. Okay, well, we'll let Mr Fred handle this himself. Mr Gideon will now contact Mr Turner so that he can submit any petition he wishes. I intend to petition myself. If it is a question of sending me back to the Penitentiary, I want to act in my own way. A petition. A retrial in the case of accused Gideon is inappropriate because one, the 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution expressly forbids a man to be tried twice for the same crime; and two, the State of Florida is... two years old... limitation to prosecute a crime, and the crime here was committed more than three years ago. I will give my decision at a later date. Mr Gideon, awaiting trial, I will set you free if I can pay a thousand dollar bail. I can not afford. The trial is scheduled for a month from now... August 19, 1963. Hi, Clarence. How are you doing today? I see that the glasses have been returned to you, right? It's great, really great... and you look great in a suit, you know that? Look, you don't have to worry, I have everything ready. I heard about everything you've done. And I wanted to come here just to cheer you up. It's very kind of you. This time, I have a lawyer I kept working, asking questions and talking to people, finding out the truth. Very well... please... God protect the United States of America, the State of Florida and its honourable Court. God help us to do impartial justice. Please have a seat. The case of the State of Florida versus Clarence Earl Gideon. Is the state ready for trial? There, Your Honour. Is the defence ready? Ready, Your Honour. Ready, Your Honour. Mr Gideon, you filed a petition, claiming that this judgement represents a double risk and that a retrial is also prohibited by statute of limitations in the State. A retrial resulting from the provision of the prisoner's own appeal is not a double risk and the statute of limitations does not apply when the appeal causes a retrial. Petition denied. You can examine the jurors, Mr Harris. Do any of you have any prejudice against the accused that might prevent you from doing your duty? They are satisfactory, Your Honour. Your Honour, I would like to refuse Mr Laureen and Mr Polak. Laureen doesn't like anything, no alcohol, and Polak likes to condemn. The jury is satisfactory, Your Honour. Satisfactory, Your Honour. You can call your first witness. Lester Wade. Lester Wade. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, with God's help? - I swear. - Sit down. Mr Wade, where were you at 5:30 am on June 3, 1961? Across from Bay Harbour Poolroom. Who or what did you see? I saw Clarence Earl Gideon inside the poolroom. What else did you see? I saw him leave with a bottle of wine and take a taxi. Then I went back to the poolroom and saw that it was broken into. The destroyed cigarette machine and the coin box on the empty pool table. Did you notice anything interesting when Mr Gideon left? Yes, sir. He had a full pocket. The witness is yours. Mr Wade. What were you doing near poolroom at 5:30 in the morning? I was returning from a dance in Apalachicola. And how did you get back? By car, with friends... Ah yes... What are their names? Ah, I don't remember now... Don't you remember any more names? No, not at the moment. Okay, so can you tell me what that car was like? Yes, it was an old Chevrolet. And these friends of yours... how did they leave you two blocks from home, when they had already covered 100 kilometres? Wow... I don't know that... you know, I think I wasn't with... What? I intended to stay there, until the poolroom open, around 7 am... And you all drank a little that night, didn't you? A beer or two... Where, huh? In Apalachicola... But it is strange, in Apalachicola the bars are closed after midnight... When you and your friends returned at 5:30, couldn't you still be a little thirsty? Did you get into that Bay Harbour Poolroom? No sir. Didn't you leave with six cases of beer? No sir. You stayed there a long time by the poolroom, didn't you, Lester? A little... There are always a lot of advertising posters on the glass, don't you? How could you look and see someone with all those posters? But it turns out that I saw... And the glass part is very high, that is, it is too high to see through it... However, you did not call the police... neither then nor after... It is true... Have you never been convicted of a crime, Wade? No sir. Ah... ah... doomed, no. I stole a car once and... I had a probation. Now... wait a minute... listen... at the first trial, when Mr Gideon asked him if he had already been convicted of a crime, you answered "no sir, I never was". It is a false answer, testifying against Wade's character and his credibility as a witness. It is not necessarily false testimony. And also. No, the allegation of guilt is not the same as being convicted. It's exactly the same. No. Enough discussion. Both reached the goal. Mr Wade. Did you ever deny that you were guilty of a crime? Yes, sir. When and where did you deny the existence of your criminal record? It was here, at his last trial. That's it. Was Clarence Earl Gideon allowed to play poolroom in the early morning hours of June 3, 1961? Do not. The witness is yours. Have others run your poolroom from time to time? On occasion. And did Mr Gideon work for you? It was never on the sheet. But sometimes I did, didn't I? Well, sometimes... The dollar and a half that Mr Gideon paid him to take him to the city, he paid exactly how? Six coins. And did he recommend anything to you, to answer if someone asked if he had seen you that night? If anyone asked about him, I hadn't seen him. The witness is yours. Mr Dime. When Mr Gideon got into his taxi, what was his state of sobriety? What is it? Oh... Were you drunk or sober? He was sober. Did he have any wine? No sir. Any beer? No sir. Any soda? No sir. Were your pockets full? No sir. Now we just heard what Mr Gideon said. If anyone asked about him, he hadn't seen him. Right? Yes, sir. Now tell me. Has Mr Gideon ever taken your taxi before? Yes, sir. In those other times, he didn't say the same sentence: "If someone asks for me, you haven't seen me"? Yes, sir. He never told you why? Yes, sir. Then tell the Court what he said on those occasions. Well, Mr Gideon had marital problems. Problem with the woman, from time to time. Well, and who among us doesn't, huh? And what he said earlier was that he didn't want anyone to know about his private affairs. And that is why I did not want you to say that I had seen you? Yes, sir. Thanks. That's it. You can come down, Mr Parks. Thanks. We called Clarence Earl Gideon to testify. Put your left hand on the bible. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, just the truth and nothing but the truth, with God's help? I swear. Sit down. Lord Gideon. On the morning of June 3, 1961, did you break into Bay Harbour Poolroom? No sir. For what purpose did you call a taxi to go to the city? To have a drink. If I had broken into the bar, I wouldn't have done that, would I? Where did you get the money you were taking? Playing. Ah. What kind of game do you play, huh? Usually gambling and poker. What kind of bet did you make? Little, because I'm in trouble. Never played with Lester Wade? Of course. I played with all the guys, you can ask. Did you bring any wine? I don't drink wine. Any beer? Do not. Any soda? Do not. Ah... one more question... Mr Stafford says that, from time to time, he directed poolroom at him. It is true? Yes, I did that. How did you get there for that purpose? I had a copy of the key for that purpose. What about the charge of breaking into Bay Harbour Poolroom? I am innocent. I know nothing about it. You had more than $25 in coins the morning you were arrested, Mr Gideon... Why did you have all that money... in coins? I've had over $100 in coins in my pocket. Why? Have you ever played a poker game? Would you carry 100 dollars in coins in your pockets for several days? Yes, sir. I'm sorry to say that, but I would never leave you in the Bay Harbour Hotel room. Do you already have a conviction for a crime? Already, five times, including this one. Ah, ah... Lester Wade... Lester Wade. This parole guy was drinking beer at the ball... Then he comes back, maybe thirsty, walks over to the poolroom, and waits outside, an hour and a half, waiting for it to open... He could walk 2 blocks home, sleep 90 minutes... Or drink a beer in your fridge... But not... He preferred to stand there on that corner, walking back and forth for 90 minutes, looking through the glass... and still thirsty... And now he says, looking through the glass, he claims he saw Clarence Earl Gideon. Only he does a very peculiar thing... He doesn't call the police, he doesn't notify the owner... he just walks to the corner and then comes back... Why? I know why... And you too... No more midnight beer in Apalachicola and Lester Wade and his friends are still thirsty... So, what happened to beer, wine and soda? I will tell you what happened. They left it in that old Chevrolet. Now, why was Wade around the corner, pacing? I answer them. He was watching. What about Gideon? He leaves his hotel, goes to the phone booth and calls a taxi. Take the taxi, which takes you to the city. Wade, who is on guard, sees him... and then, when the police show up, this is the perfect answer for Wade... He accuses Gideon. 25 dollars, all in change. It's a lot to carry in your pocket. But Mr Gideon had $100 exchanged in his pockets. Do you believe that? Do you believe in this whole story, sir? Lester Wade is not on trial. There is no evidence of Wade's animosity towards Gideon. There is no proof that Wade and his friends took the beer and wine. They must be based on evidence from the process, not speculation. They must rely on the facts not what a lawyer like Mr Turner would like you to believe. Deliver the verdict to the officer. Stand up the accused. Clarence Earl Gideon was found not guilty by the jury. Session is closed. What are you going to do now? The first thing, trying to locate my children. And... well, one thing... I think I would like to go back to poolroom tonight. Ah... ah... ah... Could someone lend me a few dollars? Thank you, Mrs Curtis. Gideon, do you think you've accomplished anything? Oh, I did. On November 1, 1963, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy said: if an obscure Florida convict named Clarence Earl Gideon, in prison, had not sat down with a pencil and paper to write a letter to the Supreme Court and if the Supreme Court hadn't taken the trouble to examine the merits of this rude petition, among the mountain of correspondence that you must receive daily, our American law machine would have continued to function undisturbed. But Gideon wrote that letter. The Court examined your case. He was tried again, with the help of a competent defence lawyer. Found innocent and released from prison after two years of punishment for a crime you didn't commit... and the entire course of American legal history has been changed.
