That's amazing. I've got emails pouring in from all over the place. Heck, I've even got reservations for next season. And companies are asking how they can sponsor the next video. Does this mean what I think this means, Mr. C? Yes, it worked, you did it. (GENTLE MUSIC) Black River Ranch is back in business. (LAUGHS) High fives. Don't leave me hangin', girls. (GROUP LAUGHS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) I love these first days of camp. You know, there's no campers around and it's just us staff girls. (SIGHS) Me, too. Lisa, I'm really looking forward to hanging out with you this year. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I'm gonna be a whole new Stacey. College has really changed me. (CHUCKLES) Okay, but I like the old Stacey. Just try to be the best you that you can be. Did you know that I raised $5,000 for Africa last year? - Africa? - Mm-hmm. It's this huge country. It's a place where lots and lots of poor people live. Yeah, I am aware of Africa, and it's actually a continent. But, wow, that is amazing. I am just expressing admiration and envy. How did you raise the money and what'd you do with it? Well, my dad donated the first thousand and then four of his friends matched the rest. Raising money for poor people is so simple. You just post it online. Yeah, I wonder why poor people don't post online more. STACEY: I know. (CHUCKLES) - Go on. - What? What did you do with the $5,000? I went to Africa. Stacey, I'm just curious, how does you going to Africa help Africa? (SIGHS) It raises awareness, Lisa. When popular and pretty people, like myself, go to places like that, people just tend to notice. You have no idea how many likes, comments, and shares my photos got. (CHUCKLES) I can only imagine. Ooh, and did you know that I joined Campus Warriors for Social Justice? It's so fun! We made cardboard shelters and we slept in them the entire night. - The entire night, huh? - Mm-hmm. I totally understand the homeless now, and I only went inside my dorm room once and that was just to use the bathroom and to charge my iPhone. - Hey, Stacey? - Yeah. You remember when I said, last summer, that we could be friends and even maybe like sisters, but sometimes it would probably be better if we rode in silence? Yeah, do you wanna do that again? - Yes, please. - 'Kay. Yeah, we can do that. (SOFT COUNTRY MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Kimberly, are you sure about this? Dad, yes, for the 10th time, yes. You could've taken a lifeguard job at the club if you wanted to earn some money. Come here for a week or so, then join the real world. That's not how Horse Camp works, remember? I can't believe it. It's been four years since you've been here. (SCOFFS) How'd I get so old so fast? You're not that old, Daddy. And I'm looking forward to seeing old friends. It is nice being back in Michigan. It's been a long time since I visited. Why'd your company make you leave anyways? We went over this a hundred times, beautiful. I have to go where my job sends me. It's not my call. I'm just a small guy. I'm not the boss. I think you're great. - Well. - I do. Thank you, beautiful. I just want you to work on your resume, you know? A good college, a good job, it'll give you opportunities I never had. There's a lot more to Black River than just horses, Dad. - You saw that on the website. - Maybe. Maybe it's just girls riding horses. I don't know. (SIGHS) Well, here we are. Listen, Kimbie, things change. Your old friends, they just may not be here. And this may not be everything you're expecting. If you want out at any time, I mean any time, just call. I think they confiscate our phones for a reason. There's no good reason when you're my daughter and I miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too. Okay, kiddo, you're the boss. (CHUCKLES) I just work here. Are you gonna be okay without me? Sure, I'm a tough guy, remember? Gonna put some flowers on your mother's monument, gonna go home, eat some chocolate, and watch reruns of "Mister Ed." That's my version of Horse Camp. (LAUGHS) You're such a nut. (CHUCKLES) This is your last chance, beautiful. You say the word and we're outta here. I need this, Dad, please? I'm gonna miss you. (GENTLE MUSIC) You need some help? No, that's okay. (ENGINE RUMBLING) Good bye, honey, I love you. Love you, Daddy. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SLOW MUSIC) Welcome, Kimberly? Wow, have you gotten tall since I saw you last. Happens to the best of us, Mr. C. Where is Miss Jessica? Miss Jessica is now Mrs. Jessica. She got married last year and moved on with her life, so she won't be with us this year. Oh, she was always so nice to me. You see, little ones, Black River Farm and Ranch will live within you forever. This place is your sanctuary. I love it here, Miss Jessica. And I love my horse, Lord Byron. And he loves you, too. And if you ever come back, he'll be here for you. Only if you're here, Miss Jessica. I'll never leave Black River. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) - She was the best. - Yes, she was, but you're gonna like all of our new counselors, too. This is Miss Lisa, our new head counselor. Let's grab your bags. We'll drop 'em in the dining hall for Jerry to grab and I'll show you to your bunkhouse, okay? Okay. Let's go. SAM: Oh, Riley B, right here. You're kidding, right? (TENSE MUSIC) What's wrong? Well, for one, it looks like it's infested with Lyme ticks. - And two? - Two? I've seen jail barracks that are more accommodating. Well, I guess we like to keep things simple around here. Simple, I get. This is primitive. (SCOFFS) Look, Riley, just try to enjoy yourself while you're here, okay? Hey, we have great horses, a petting zoo. We even have an opera house. I hate opera. Yeah, me, too. (CHUCKLES) - Dude. - What? You're so, so nice. (CHUCKLES) I didn't always used to be, but this place grows on you, you know? But now I get to act nicely a whole lot. I don't, I'm not a nice girl. I don't have it in me. I'll bet you do. (LIGHT MUSIC) (ZIPPER WHIZZING) Are you looking at the horses? I'm looking at my horse. Lord Byron, he's still here. (HORSE WHINNYING) Come on, let's go show you your bunk. Now, you can keep your cell phone, but we urge restricted use here at Black River, so it's kind of like a sanctuary and a peaceful place away from all the craziness in the outside world. - You have no idea... - Hey, girls. How much I want that, Miss Lisa. Hey, ladies. Oh, that's nice. Wait, where's the old opera house? It's behind us, on the other side of the general store. Why do I remember it being near the dining hall? I don't know, but I promise you we did not move it. Whoa. Wait, was this always here? No, this bunkhouse was built last year. Oh. Things aren't always gonna be the way that you remember them. Should I walk you in? No, that's okay. I already know all the girls. LISA: Are you sure? KIMBERLY: Of course, okay, thanks. LISA: Okay. (DOOR SQUEAKS) (HORSE WHINNYING) SARA: Riley B, I'll take those car keys now. You can keep your phone. No way, my wheels are my freedom. No go on the key thing. It's the rules, B. Or you're horse history, get it? Just do it, Ry. I had to give up mine, too. Look, the keys are kept in Mr. C's office. They'll be safe there. And should you find that Horse Camp isn't to your liking, they'll be there for you when you're ready to go. Come on. (KEYS JINGLING) Thank you. Ry! (AWKWARD MUSIC) Taylor, Georgie, Macey. Who the heck are you? It's me, Kimberly. - Who? - Kimberly. Yeah, I heard you. - I have no idea who you are. - Kimberly. So that's three times now that you've said your name. Still nothing. We were best friends five summers ago. Oh, well, okay, welcome back. I think I sort of remember you. Okay, whatever. So here's the 411, I'm only here because my dad knows Mr. C, and thinks I need to be more spiritual and less snotty. (SCOFFS) I don't think this is gonna work, but he promised to buy me a Porsche if I lasted the summer, so. What are we doing this summer? At least we get to keep our cell phones this summer. Right? Let's go take selfies on the Wishing Bridge. (GIRLS FAINTLY CHATTERING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SOFT MUSIC) Wow, she changed. SARA: Just be patient with her, Kim. We're all made of imperfect clay. Yeah, I still remember what Miss Jessica always told us. What's that? (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) The most important thing in the world, next to love, is kindness. If you can help someone else out without any expectation of reward, you've become someone magical. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (CHUCKLES) Ain't that the truth. I just wish more people practiced that. Don't worry about it, I'm new too, so wanna go look at the horses? - Sure. - Cool, let's go. - Bye, girls. - Bye. (SOFT MUSIC) A man should be an oak of strength and discipline. Exercise in the morning, hard work at night, and prayer. Hardworking all day and prayer at night. (HAMMER THUDDING) The... (ROCKS CRUNCHING) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sneak up on you like that. No, it's okay. (STAMMERING) I've been mumbling. I've been listening to a self-help... Can I help you? (LAUGHS) Yes, I'm looking for the head riding instructor. - Her name's Stacey, I think. - Yeah, that's her. (SCOFFS) That's our Stacey. Fine rider, good rider. She's (SIGHS) excellent rider. So maybe you could point me in the right direction? Even better, I'll take you to her. Right straight, I (LAUGHS)... - Miss? - Bonnie Lightyear. Beautiful name. Right this way. Oh, I'm Jerry, by the way. Oh, my goodness, I got this hammer in my hand. Pleasure to meet you, Jerry. And it's Bonnie. Just plain old Bonnie, nothing special. All evidence to the contrary. (CHUCKLES) Well, aren't you the charmer. I heard that in the tapes. I'm sorry, you heard what in the tapes? The all evidence to the contrary line that I... (LAUGHS) Oh, well, I won't tell anyone. I still have this hammer in my hand. Mm-hmm, yes, you do, Jerry. - I'll put it down here. - Okay. - It should be okay here. - Yeah. - I'll put it down here. - Okay. - It should be okay here. - Yeah, I think. I think so. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SOFT MUSIC) Another summer, old boy. I should've been head counselor this year and not Lisa. It's not fair. Hi, there. RILEY: Hi, he's so pretty. He's a champion. In his day, Baron won more than just a few shows. He's mine and I belong to him. Do you wanna brush him? - Really? - Yeah. RILEY: You're really nice. Oh, you should see me ride. RILEY: I bet you're really good. Good? I'm the best. I am the best rider that Black River ever produced. Everyone says so. RILEY: I'd love to watch you ride. I would look forward to that, too, young lady. I hear you have potential. Potential, excuse me, who are you? - I'm Bonnie Lightyear. - The Bonnie Lightyear? Good, you've heard of me. That should make things much, much easier. I mean, I did win National Championships '94, '95, '98. Well, Ms. Lightyear, welcome to the 21st century. You must be Stacey. Mr. C did tell me you were the head riding instructor last year. (AWKWARD MUSIC) Don't see me as someone trying to take your job because I'm here for one year and one year only. Actually, if I were you, I'd look at it as an opportunity to learn. But I'm the head rider. Not this year, sweetheart. Not this year. So I was told to check in with you, you'd tend to my horse, and show me my quarters. - But... - Oh, and by the way, Mr. Feathers here, he's a very good judge of human nature, - and he only likes nice people. - But. - But... - Stacey, you'll be our head riding instructor again next year, but this year is an excellent opportunity for you and the other girls to learn from a really top-end horsewoman. - But... - Have you seen their videos online? They're really remarkable. (SILLY MUSIC) She's really quite amazing, isn't she? But... Yeah. That lady sure is nice. She sure is. I better get my hammer. (SYDNEY GIGGLES) ♪ Boring ♪ ♪ It's not so boring ♪ ♪ Boring ♪ (CAMPERS EXCITEDLY CHATTERING) - Hello, everyone. - Hi. If I can have your attention really quick, I just wanna say a few words. First off, I would like to welcome back our old friends once again. - Whoa! - Welcome home! (CAMPERS CHEERING) (CAMPERS APPLAUDING) And, secondly, I'd like to welcome our new arrivals. Ladies, if this is your first year, please stand up. (CAMPERS CHEERING) (CAMPERS APPLAUDING) And, lastly, I would like to remind you all that this place is for you. (SLOW TENDER MUSIC) It's not for us, the counselors. It's not for the people who run the ranch. We can thank Jerry and Mr. C for that. I'd like to say a few words that my head counselor, Miss Jessica, used to say on our first days of camp. BR Horse Camp is kind of like a place called Oz. It is a place of. COUNSELORS: Safety, learning, and fun. Not only for you, but for the horses, as well. Most importantly, through all the fun and the riding, it is a place of learning. Not like in school or in classrooms, but more like life lessons. Lessons that you will carry with you for the rest of your lives. I create every program at BR with that goal in mind. We wanna create a kind of paradise. (CHUCKLES) And I hope that, at the end of this summer, you take away with you the invaluable lesson and gift of friendship. Welcome, all. (CAMPERS CHEERING) Everyone, have a great time. And, tomorrow, we'll ride! (CAMPERS CHEERING) (CAMPERS APPLAUDING) - Woo-ooh! - Woo! (VEHICLES WHOOSHING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Now, is the time for the first announcements. It will be Lisa's first time doing it. I should've given her notes. She's been watching you for several years, Jess. I'm sure she's got it handled. I hope she doesn't change any of the rules. There are reasons behind all of my rules, you know? Yep. People can get hurt around horses, Dave. I rode bulls and bareback broncos for seven years, Jess. I know the dangers. Oh, my goodness, bareback riding? We don't allow any bareback riding at the yard. It's so dangerous. I hope Lisa hasn't convinced Mr. C to change his mind about it. It's a very safe camp, dear. I'm sorry. What about your job? Doing anything important? Oh, you know, just busy protecting the whole county. - Nothing big. - Good. Oh, no, Dave! Dave, tonight's the Ice Cream Social. What if Lisa didn't order any of the sprinkles? It would be ruined.

About the last time I was here. - Has it changed that much? - Kinda. You know, it changes every year. And we want it to always stay the same, but sometimes the changes we're resistant to most are actually for the better. A lot of my old friends aren't here. Well, four years is a long time, but you'll make new friends. And the ones that are here, they've more or less forgotten about me. Give it time. There's a lot of summer left. Can I make a confession? This is all new to me, too. I mean, this is my first year as head counselor and it's a lot of responsibility, and it's honestly not that fun. I'm sure you're gonna do a great job. Thank you. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (HORSE NEIGHING) This is so boring. Seriously, an entire summer with no boys, no wheels, and bad wifi? (SCOFFS) Maybe it's fun for you girls, but I'm a little more exciting than that.

You don't think I know anything about you? I know everything about you. Really, how? Because I am you. I'm spoiled and nobody likes me. I used to have a ton of girls that would follow me, but they only followed me because they were scared of me. They were scared that I would destroy them socially if they ever crossed me. I'm stuck-up. I think I'm Queen of the Hill. I'm too good for everything here. Well, I'm not that bad. Oh, sure you are. You haven't even been on a horse this year. (CHUCKLES) I just really haven't felt like it yet. I remember you from last year. You're the girl that's too afraid to ride horses. I'm not afraid of anything. Okay, prove it. Take one ride from Bonnie today and after a ride or two, if you're still bored, I will give you the keys myself. That's a dare, right? Yeah, you betcha. I'm daring you. You up to it? Up to it? (SNICKERS) I welcome it. (SLOW DRAMATIC MUSIC) I'm ready to ride. You ever trotted on a horse before, honey? No, it can't be that hard. All right, go ahead. Give it a little try. (ANXIOUS MUSIC) Piece of cake. AMBER: It's not as easy as it looks. Just get me on the saddle, then I'll be okay. Okay. All right, now hold the reins loosely in your hands.

And I thought if she's brave enough to do something that scares her, then maybe I'm brave enough to say this, I don't want to be the best rider at Black River. I want to be the best rider everywhere. Well, looks like we better get started. - How 'bout right now? - (CHUCKLES) Stacey. (SIGHS) When is the last time you rode just for the fun of it? What does that mean? Exactly what I just said. Don't you remember a time where you didn't care about being the best? You just rode because you loved to ride? You and your horse free in the fields? That's the love I want you to find again, all right? Okay. Go get yourself a horse and go ride. You got it.

It's in the mornings from eight to noon. And the rest of the day... The rest of the time, I'm driving Dave crazy. I didn't say that.

A couple of changes to make sure we stay on course. Thanks, Mr. C. (SQUEALS) That's gonna be an issue, isn't it? Yes, it is. And she is driving me crazy. Don't even think about changing your mind.

You just never said anything. Ah, it's not a subject I'm fond of. I told, Mike, Mr. C, when he hired me, but we haven't discussed it since. And you haven't dated or anything since then. (SCOFFS) No. Well, it's been... I think Emma would understand. And you now have your eye on Bonnie. Who wouldn't? But I don't know. (SCOFFS) What would I even say to her?

You've been very ambitious. (CHUCKLES) Some of them are, well, you know, interesting. Others, I just don't think we can do. - For example... - Yeah. I'm just gonna pause you right there for a moment. Girls, this meeting is over. So, Jessica, I need to talk to you outside and you guys can go back to your stations. Thank you. That means now. Jessica, I love you. Aww, I love you, too, Lisa. Yes, but you are welcome back here part time as a junior counselor. My changes are my changes. As long as you stay with my schedule and my budget, I would love to have you here, but it's a yes or a no. A junior counselor after all I've done for Black River. Lisa's the senior counselor this year, babe. You gotta respect that. Whose side are you on? (DAVE HUFFS) Yours, you're 100% right, she's wrong. Would you like me to call her a name now? No, don't you dare. Lisa is pure and good and, oh, my goodness. She was right, wasn't she? I went right in there and I disrespected her in front of her entire staff. In front of her staff, Dave. I am a horrible person. No, no, you're not. Are you sure? I'm positive. (SLOW MUSIC) How'd you get to be so smart? I listen to you for two years and I learn what you want me to say.

I've seen this sort of thing before. - Would you mind if I... - Jess, I'm sorry if I was harsh earlier. (SCOFFS) No, no, it was my fault. It really was. If you can help Zoey have a great summer, I would really appreciate it, Jess. Go ahead, thank you. No, thank you. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (TENSE MUSIC) She walks around camp without any friends. And I looked into it and... Honey, look, I don't mean to be short, but I've got a hundred things to do for work today. Look, you and Lisa are amazing. I'm sure you will figure out a way to help this girl out. - Zoey. - Fine. And I think I have a plan to help her. Well, see, there you go. I want you to mentor her. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - What? - Yeah. No, no, no. Look, Black River is a fantastic place, but it's your place. I mean, you're the one that wanted to work part time there. You know, this is your thing. Her father was a Detroit firefighter. She lost him this year. You're so good with horses and I think she might respond better to a man. Especially, a man in uniform. Okay. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Okay? - Yeah. Yeah, thank you. You owe me. (LIPS SMACKING) Okay, paid in full. (SOFT UPBEAT MUSIC) (CAMPERS FAINTLY SHOUTING) - Oh, wow, great. - Finally, returned! - Oh, that's out. - Sorry! Volleyball? (GIRLS GIGGLING) - Now take a step. - Breathe! (CAMPERS FAINTLY SHOUTING) Okay, so what are we gonna do next? Just hit the birdie. It's not like we're keeping score. No, I mean about Bonnie and Jerry. - Oh. - Seriously, they've gone on five walks together, eat lunch together, but he won't even hold her hand. He's so shy. I have an idea. I liked a boy once, but my sister stole him and it just made me so angry. So what's your idea? Come on. (GIRLS CHUCKLING) (MISCHIEVOUS MUSIC) Girls, Jerry's love life is none of your business. It's none of my business. I don't even think I should be saying the words love life in front of you girls. We're 16 years old, Mr. C. And Jerry is a grown man. If he wants to ask a woman out on a date, I'm sure he can do it on his own. He really can't. I want his brother's phone number. If I can call him, then our plan will work. - Girls. - Just look at the situation for yourself, Mr. C. You'll see that I'm right. (GENTLE MUSIC) (HOOVES CLOPPING) (HORSES WHINNYING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (HORSE NEIGHING) (HORSE WHINNYING) Jerry? JERRY: Hmm? What are you working on? Oh, pretty well. Jerry, maybe you need a break? (STAMMERING) I was gonna get that painted. Jerry, I'm gonna go to Mexico and let Stacey run the ranch. How do you feel about that, Jerry? (CHUCKLES) Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's a good idea. Caribbean is nice. (HORSE NEIGHING) The Caribbean is nice. (MR. C SCOFFS) (HORSE WHINNYING) (SLOW BROODING MUSIC) Hey, we don't have to talk if you don't want to. I get it. I know right now it seems like nobody in this whole world understands you, but I do. You see, my father, he was in the Army. He went out one day. My mom and I, we would look at the calendar, and we'd mark off all the days until he would return, but he never returned. You see, I work for the sheriff's department. I don't really know any of the firemen in Detroit. But here, in Sanilac County, I know all of 'em. And I'll tell you this, all firemen are heroes. You never forget that.

I'm not taking lessons from you, Amber. Baron wants you to use the left lead, Stacey. Don't fight him. Become one with your horse. When his feet touch down, it should feel like your feet are touching the earth. When his lungs fill, you should feel the oxygen. Good, now, listen to me. This is gonna be new and scary for ya, but I want you to loosen up on the reins. Soon, you're going to drop them entirely and ride without them. Your body and mind will jell with his. You will think a command and your horse will move. - Hey. - Hey. First year blues? No, I'm okay. I just have a hard time making friends sometimes. Yeah, it's definitely not easy coming in as a first-time camper. I remember when I was 16 and we had a brand new girl, Kathy. And, unfortunately, I wasn't very nice to her at first. Why not? I wanted to be popular. So you were just mean to her all summer so you could be popular? Well, no, she ended up being super popular and, as you could guess, I started being really nice to her. Wait, so you were mean to her so you could become popular and then you were nice to her after she became popular? I'm sorry, that's just really shallow. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And (SIGHS) it gets worse. How? Well, when Kathy became the brand new Queen B, we all started being really mean to Stacey. You mean Miss Stacey, like the really good rider? Yeah, that's the one. And I'm not saying I'm proud it. What I am trying to say is, with some time, we all became really good friends and maybe that'll happen for you. Thanks, think I really needed to hear that. - Yeah. - I really am okay, though. Okay, all right, I just wanted to check on you. Thank you. (SOFT MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (HORSE NEIGHING) Stacey, you're really doing a great job. Thank you. I really feel myself improving. I didn't think that was possible. (BONNIE GIGGLES) I want you to start riding at night. - At night, but that's... - Dangerous? (CHUCKLES) Only if you don't trust your horse. You think it's dangerous because you can't see as well. See, you're still thinking with your human senses. Become one with your horse. Horses run on their own at night all the time. If you can live through your horse, Stacey, you can ride at night. (EXCITED MUSIC) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (HORSE WHINNYING) Okay, Baron, I'm trusting you. Let's go ride. (EXCITED MUSIC) (HOOVES CLOPPING) (WHIMSICAL MUSIC) (BRIGHT MUSIC) One piece of cake each! MACEY: It's horrible. I wish I could get like... - Girls? - Hi. LISA: Can I talk to Riley for just a moment, please? - Yeah. - Thank you. MACEY: No problem. - Riley. - Hi, Miss Lisa. How do you think your summer's going? I think everything's a-okay. - That is great to hear. - Yeppers. Do you think that it is for everybody else? What do you mean? (SLOW PENSIVE MUSIC) Do you remember your first year at camp? I was still a camper with you. Yeah, I'll never forget how nice you were to me that summer. Do you think you've been nice to Rebecca? I haven't been mean to Rebecca. I didn't ask if you've been mean to Rebecca. I asked if you were nice to Rebecca. (RILEY STAMMERING) It's her first year. It's not easy. (HORSE NEIGHING) (HORSE SNORTING) Hi, brother. (QUIRKY MUSIC) How's it goin', Larry? Right as rain. What are you doing here? Came to see my brother, but ended up talking to this lovely lady instead. (BONNIE CHUCKLES) I can see that your brother's also quite the charmer. Huh? How's your first month on Horse Camp been, Bonnie? So far, I'd say rather outstanding. You two know each other? We just met. Getting along well, though. Indeed. I was just telling Bonnie, here, how I'm the head handyman and groundskeeper at the golf course here in town. Bit more money in it than the head handyman at the Black River. But that isn't important, is it, Jerry? Not to me, Larry. (GIGGLES) You can definitely tell the two of you are brothers. I don't like this. She's funny and beautiful and kind, and I saw her first! - So you fancy her, then? - Yes, I do. - You do? - Yes, I do. I like you very much! Why are you yelling? Larry got me upset. Hey, I got a phone call from some of the campers. They thought you needed a good kick in the seat, brother. (BONNIE CHUCKLES) (SOFT MUSIC) Jerry, I like you, too. - You do? - (LAUGHS) Yes. Even better now that you're not yelling.

Right, I love the picnic idea. I think it's lame and they're gonna know it's a setup. Who cares? By the time they figure it out, they'll have to go through with it. What do you think, Rebecca, you in? Oh, yeah, I think it's a great idea. I'm totally in. Well, that settles it then. Let's plan the most romantic picnic ever. (ROOSTER CROWING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) See, I started riding when I was real young. (TENDER MUSIC) One time, we had this old mule. I was ridin' on him. I couldn't have weighed more than 50 pounds. He decided he wanted to ride right into the center of town. There was nothing I could do about it, except hold on. (BOTH GIGGLING) And, you know, it's a small town and everybody's used to seeing horses, but not mules. That guy was so smart. You know what he did? He walked right up to the grocery store and he stood there in front of the door until they opened. As soon as they opened the doors, in he walked. - Really? - (CHUCKLES) Yeah. There was nothing I could do, except duck. I'm sitting there with my little feet kickin' him and yellin', "Whoa," and pullin' on the reins, tryin' to get him to stop, but that guy was too smart, man. He walked right up to the produce section, started eatin' all the carrots. (LAUGHS) You're funny. It's a true story, kid. - You ready to go? - Yep. You ready, Mark? All right, let's go. Come on, buddy. (TONGUE CLICKING) Come on. (HORSE BRAYING) (SOFT ROMANTIC MUSIC) (HORSES WHINNYING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (HORSE NEIGHING) (HORSE BRAYING) (NOTE RUSTLING) (HORSE WHINNYING) (HAND KNOCKING) I got your note. Huh?

Okay, fire away. - Real plates and silverware. - Huh? Twinkling romantic lights. - We don't have those. - Wine? We definitely don't sell wine to campers. You're only one year older than me, Sara. Miss Sara, and nobody sells me wine, either. Miss Keilah, can you help out here? Mm-hmm, basically, we just sell candy. Ugh, Kimbie, we can just go buy everything online. Ooh, ooh, I know. How about a happy camper t-shirt? KIMBERLY: (SCOFFS) No. Okay. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (HORSE NEIGHING) Stacey, you look like you have something on your mind. I just... (PAPER RUSTLING) Dear Bonnie, I wanted to thank you for helping me this summer. I've been on six night rides so far and I know that I'm growing in my horse skills every day because of your teachings. I didn't even know that it was possible to ride without reins, but I'm doing it. (TENDER MUSIC) At first, I did not want you here. I knew you were a better rider than I am and I was jealous of you, but I'm really glad that you came. You've taught me so much and I just wanted to let you know how very much it means to me. So thank you. Thank you, Stacey. That was really nice to hear. You're welcome. - Stacey? - Yeah? You know, when we first met, I was jealous of you, too. Because of my youth and good looks? You reminded me of me. I was always the best rider. Every camp, every show, every competition, always the best rider. I was always the prettiest. And I was meaner than a snake. I spent years hurting other girl's feelings and I actually enjoyed it. So, yeah, when we first met, I was jealous. I was jealous because you still have time to change, Stacey. Thank you for this. Thank you. (STACEY SNIFFLES) - Uncle Dave? - Yeah? Do you believe in heaven? (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) I don't know. I think so. I mean, I'd like to think that all the people we've lost are looking down on us, you know? And a lot of people with the near-death experiences that say they see a bright light and feel real peaceful, really happy, you know, maybe that's heaven. Do you think there'll be horses there? - Absolutely. - Will my father be there? Sweetie, all firemen go to heaven. That, I'm sure of.

Thank me, what for? I know it wasn't easy for you in the beginnlng of the summer. You know, with me becoming head counselor and Mr. C bringing in a ringer to lead the horse program. Probably felt like people forgot about you. (HEARTFELT MUSIC) It did. But you hung in there and didn't quit on me, and I wanna say thank you for that because BR needs you and I need you. And you may not ride at Bonnie's level, but, technically, no one in the world actually does. But you are an excellent horsewoman. Thank you. And you're even better now. I mean, Bonnie's gonna leave us and you're gonna be our head riding instructor again next summer. And you are really good. That means a lot to me. Thank you. And I have to admit, I was a little nervous about your abilities to be a cabin counselor in the beginning of the summer. But you were pretty good. Was I the best cabin counselor that you had? You were pretty good. I think head riding instructor's gonna be the best spot for you next summer, but you were better than I expected. Lisa, Mr. C made the right choice. You're the best person for head counselor. I couldn't have done it and none of the other girls could've either. Thank you, Stacey. Do you remember at the beginning of the summer when you asked me if any of the projects I worked on actually helped anyone? Flying first class to Africa is not charity, Stacey. I'm not going to fly coach, Lisa. Have you seen it back there? - It's barbaric. - Mm-hmm, Stacey. Okay, but I was thinking, if you'll have me, I'd really like to work on one of your projects, like an actual charity. Well, if you actually mean that, then I would love to have you. (GIGGLES) Okay, we should go shopping. We could wear matching outfits. I will pick them out just because I have the better style, but I'll do you a favor. We'll buy blue because blue is gonna really compliment your eyes. But I think I should pick you up because I do need to valet, and I don't know what kind of car you have. I can't be seen in rust. Do you wanna get lunch? I know this is new to you. (GENTLE MUSIC) (HORSES BRAYING) Wow, Jerry, you really outdid yourself. I did? Yeah, you sure did. I mean, look at this. Yeah, I did. (BONNIE CHUCKLES) (LAUGHS) This is really nice, isn't it? It is, it is. Look. (GIRLS GIGGLING) Thank you, this is so great. (GIRLS GIGGLING) It's great because you're here with me. (GIRLS GASPING) (GIRLS SOFTLY LAUGHING) Did you hear something? No, me? - Look, chicken. - Yes. I think I remember you saying you like chicken, Jerry. I do, I like chicken. I think I like you more. More than chicken? Even more than chicken. (LIPS SMACKING) See? (GIRLS GIGGLING) Come on. (GIRLS SNICKERING) Hurry. (LEAVES RUSTLING) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Mission accomplished, ladies. I could get used to this whole matchmaking thing. It was an amazing team effort. I wonder if anyone will ever love us like that. Of course, somebody will. He'll be handsome. But not cocky. And a perfect smile. And a castle. Or maybe just a really nice house on a lake. And he'll be older, like really old. Like maybe even 20. (GIRLS GIGGLING) RILEY: Good night, Kimbie.

Our theme this year was "The Kindness Quest" and it was a overwhelming success and it's entirely due to all of you. I know it may seem that what we did here at BR this summer may have only impacted us. But, please, take these lessons you learned here at Black River Farm and Ranch and share them with the world. I know we all love horses. But at its core, BR is not about horses. We build strong female leaders, women of confidence, who spread kindness into the world. And I wanna say thank you to my friend, Miss Jessica. You have taught me so much each and every summer of my life and I wouldn't be the woman that I am today without you. Oh, thank you, Lisa. (CAMPERS GIGGLING) You are all very special to me. And from what I can see, you all learned something about being nice to one another. So, please, when you go back into the real world, take the gift of BR with you and spread that magic into the world. And I know I'm probably taking a risk, but I was hoping my good friend Miss Stacey has something that she can add to this. So, if you would, please give a round of applause to next year's head riding instructor, Miss Stacey? (CAMPERS APPLAUDING) - Woo-woo-woo! - Woo-woo! Thank you. Wow, that's gonna be a really hard speech to follow after Miss Lisa's act. (CAMPERS LAUGHING) (WHIMSICAL MUSIC) But I only have this to say, I've been at BR for quite a few years now and this is the first year that my eyes were opened to, well, to myself. I was always Queen of the Hill and I never cared about what anybody else thought. Even when I went to Africa to help feed the poor, it was just an outward, kind of, play acting. I just wanted to show the world how cool I was. But it wasn't real kindness because it didn't come from the heart. True kindness is when you give and you expect nothing in return. And I think I finally understand that now thanks to my good friend, Miss Lisa, and to my new friends to whom I owe so much. I love you all. Aww, I love you.
