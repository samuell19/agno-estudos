CJ Entertainment inc. Presents in association with Cinema Service Co., Ltd. A KnJ Entertainment production (Io-produced by Film It Suda THE RIGHTEOUS TIES The rain to the wind said, "You push and I'll pelt" Robert Frost Take the stab. I'm in a hurry. So... You're doing me? No kid wants to do this shit these days. Some go to the army... Some take refuge and don't come out. Seven stabs on the thigh? So, that's not enough? Stab only halfway just under the stomach. I won't dig up like the kids do. You meddle with the wrong parts... I die. Do it nice and easy. Shit, this ain't no surgery! You want an anesthesia or what? What the hell are you doing? Just let me send a text message. Shit, man. Do I have to wait for you? Noisy town, huh? Shit face. You came to stab me'? Do you hear that? That's the cops coming to protect me. Whatcha guys doing? Stand up. Drop to your knees and beg, assholes. Before you get kicked in jail for life! That's a sudden change of attitude. I'll kill you, you stupid idiot. It's a fire truck, sir. There's a fire across the street. Should've sent the text message when you could have, asshole! JUNG Jae-young JUNG Joon-ho RYU Sueng-yofig and MIN Jee-han Four previous convictions, and now attempted murder. How long should I put you in for? Please show some mercy. First time being interrogated by a prosecutor? Yeah. Mercy is no word to use in front of a prosecutor. Just try to make a deal. DONG Chi-sung. Right-hand man of KIM Young-hee. Right? Yeah. You guys follow orders. And you even disobey orders and do someone because you're the right-hand man. So you say you've done it on your own. The judge will give you 20 years. You go through all sorts of appeals, and you'll still get 15 years, as simple as that. You want to stay 15 years in jail? Now, let's consider this. Say KIM Young-hee gave the orders. Say you're indebted to him, and you just did what he told you to do. You're his right-hand man, dammit. 4 years ago I tried to bring in KIM Young-hee. He asked me whether I knew how to fit an elephant into a fridge. I said, "Open the fridge." Fit in the elephant. Close the fridge." You know what the asshole told me'? 'I tell my right-hand man to do it.' I dunno anything about the elephant story. Shit, cut the crap! Hey, after the IMF period, when all the criminals blamed for the economic downfall were brought in by the bunches, that's what you fellas got a break simply because there was no room to put you in. That was a real break you guys got, but it's different now. 15 years, I tell you. What'll you do 15 years from now'? Run a couple of bars? Help me out here, I'll give you five years. Sir. You don't know me that well, do you? The decision was made. He got seven years. Did my name pop up during the trial? Not once. Oh shit. Oh shit. - What a fucking bastard... - Hey, hey! Oh man. Oh man! Let go! Where is this guy... Hey asshole! How come you're still alive? Oh man! Fuck... My father. When did he die'? Winter last year. Must've been tough trying to dig the grave. Frozen soil and all. He was cremated. Ashes spread at the swamps at Yeosu. I got there the wrong time at low tide. So I waited six hours till the high tide arrived. I have never been with my father that long. Thanks. You must resent us for not helping you out with the death penalty. Things were bad then, both for you and the boss. Don't you recognize him? Who? That guy with the glasses. He used to have some power in the government. But he's been pegged as a communist and ended up here for life. That guy beside him is the serial killer who killed 13 at Daejeon and Chunan. Ah, back in the old days? After having been given the death sentence, I was on the waiting list. But the government got soft on me and I'm still living. I'm close to those two guys, the two closest mates in here. They'll be together till the moment they die. If you watch those two closely, you'll see that they're not looking for much. That's why they look so peaceful. I'm no different. Resentment and remorse, I don't have any. Let's eat. They say you're a slasher. Faster hands. I'll see you tomorrow. He's the head of your room. Oh. I, uh... Eat up. How long did you get? Seven years. That's a handful. So, you'll stay here for 7 whole years? I plan to leave next month. Want to get out together? Shut up and eat. This guy here and him over there. We're all in the same room. Get acquainted. I heard a dumb-ass got in. You look fine. A sailor type, you. He's in our room. Soon-tan's friend, so take care of him. Good for you. Meeting a friend before you get fucked up. And you car thief. You eat and you pay, you sleep and you pay the rent. What do you think this is, a sanitarium? It's coming in this week, I'll give it to ya. How could I forget? Yeah, yeah. Let's go eat. I swear I'll get him and serve a couple more years. You've gone through hard times. I told the bastard to talk to you, and he starts a bloodshed. I locked him up in jail, so no hard feelings, huh? Have you come to finish me off? And the thing you developed recently. I heard about it and it sounds interesting. It sure does. Why, you want to take a cut? It's about time I retire. To old to be a gangster these days. I need insurance, and it should work for the benefit of our region too. I want you to do me a favor then. My bowels hurt as hell. I've been stabbed, you know. That guy that stabbed me... I want to live longer than him. We'll have to settle this before next month. Our company's going through tough times. We'll have to think hard about this. That old bastard counts the days he'll live. He sounds serious enough. How long has Chi-sung worked with us'? Your birthday next month marks a decade. This is where Chi-sung is held. It's nearby, so go visit him when you can. No need. Bastards. You make a living with a knife, you end up pretty much like the ones you stab. Hey, lady. You think we do this to make a living? Huh? Huh? It's passion. We hold knives right now, but see what we hold later on! Hey, go! You're pissing me off. Those bastards get a shitload from me, and they still hang around. Is that being dumb or deaf? Stupid girl! Just wanted to help out... Hey, come here! Come here and talk, come on! Come here! - What's come? - Hurry! Oh! Brother. We're here! - You look good! - Boss, it's you! - And Han-wook too. - Yeah. Don't worry about the company. You'll be out in no time. It's seven years, boss. What? How do you bare seven years? We'll talk to the right people, you'll cough a couple of times, and come out in no time. We get kids out from the army like that too. Don't worry. To us, there's Independence Day, and Christmas for special pardons. In the old days it was humiliation, but that's the norm these days... Sir, Soon-tan's alive. Soon-tan. Remember him? He isn't executed, and is still alive. Aren't you surprised? He's still a dead guy to me. It was good to see him in person. Relieves the pressure, you know. I've bid farewell, so take care of him. Can't believe JUNG Soon-tan's still alive. Hello, anybody home? Hello, anybody home? Hello? Oh, you're there. How've you been? Joe-VAN. I heard you've moved. Had a hard time looking for you. How come the house is all wrapped up? It's warm inside with the wrap. Is there adequate ventilation? The boss knows. Since Chi-sung is behind bars, He'll get a good place for you to stay. A small apartment or something. Ain't taking money from a ganster. An apartment, not money. Ain't got much to provide. All this is good. It's delicious. Did you get insurance from our cousin? Yeah, two. Why would a gangster need life insurance? No one calls us gangsters. We're businessmen. We even get employment insurance. Oh my, it's salty. Even medical insurance. Eat up. If you go see Chi-sung, tell him this. That we won't go visit him. Tell him to come out rehabilitated. You sure don't sound like you're his folks. You can all live in peace these days. It was war in the past. Did Chi-sung have fast hands since he was a kid? Hey, hey! We all had fast hands back then. You guys must've heard about it, about Soon-tan. The three of us were pals since the old days. At the time we went all the way to Mokpo to beat up on the bad guys. Oh, so JUNG Soon-tan's your friend too? I heard he was a master with the knife. I heard he did a big-time guy and got life sentence. Heard he's dead already. Give me a shot. I heard he's still alive. What? Soon-tan. I heard from the boss when we went to visit Chi-sung. That Soon-tan's still alive. So what if he's still alive'? Counting days before he gets executed. And his whole family blew it, so he's got no one to take care of him. Who says the family blew it? Han-wook told me. The old geezer blew it, and almost had the boss end up in jail with a murder charge. You're a loud mouth, aren't ya? Bravo! Drink up everyone! Those bastards sure are loud. Are the bastards firemen or what? What did you just say? Have you guys rented this place? Don't know which boyscout you guys are from, but you can just shut the fuck up and drink. Huh? Does the fucking gangster not care that we are from the Korean Air Force? I just touched ground to find some idiot talk shit to me. Why beat someone up shouting bravo? The asshole called me a gangster. You are a gangster. Oh man. I've been to the army. I've got no tattoos on me. I'm even a member of the Soon-shun UNESCO, and donate every month to the Doctors without Borders. Do I look like a gangster to you? Bravo, bravo. Can't fucking believe this bastard's talking bravo again. Wait. When a day comes that you think you're facing death, I'll be around... I'll be around, so remember. Remember. Fucking bastard. Unpack and make yourself at home. What the? The guy just disappeared! It's okay. It's just a fridge we've got. Bring along the soju, too. You're pretty. You fucking bastard! Fucking asshole's crazy! Die, asshole! So you guys are still digging? Yeah, when time permits. Ut we've come across something hard, so we're taking a break. We'll have to find something sharp to drill it. By the way, did you do Kwang-ju's SUNG Bong-shik back in 2000? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven Wow, must've been a real highlight... You work out in a gym or something? Dumbass. Fighting ain't learned in a gym. Who do you think will win if a taekwondo black belt fights a street fighter? Do you think a taekwondo guy can do SUNG Bong-shik? I didn't do him. Just shoved it on his leg. We call it 'seven shoves on the thigh'. We let him live. But with a bad leg. We stab it seven times counting out loud. I'm a taekwondo black belt, by the way. Kicking is my specialty. What's up with the face? Hey, I just want to do this guy and die in here. Can't believe they still have hazers around here. I got beat pretty bad daring at him. That shithead over there? You just watch. I'll kill him. Must be hurting bad. Does it hurt? Are you serious? Yeah. He's been here a couple of days and already in solitary confinement? Sir, they say we can't visit Chi-sung. He's in solitary for a mishap. They say PARK Moon-su is still unconscious. How did he do that in such short time? I was so glad when I heard that. It ain't just you, man. DONG Chi-sung's really something. A slasher famous in this region? He did a couple of guys like a butcher. They say he's a 'slasher faster than a gun'. So he's the big guy around here now? I heard he took care of a dozen at the subway in Mokpo. I didn't know they had subways in Mokpo. What the heck? Knock on the left wall. What's on this side? You're the psycho killer? Then you're the communist geezer? What? You want me to pass your words to this guy over here? Shit, you think I'm a messenger or what? Are you two guys dating each other? You can talk in daytime. That's all you guys do during the daytime. What is this, Starbucks? Pass the words, bullshit. Fuck it. Why did I end up in a shithole like this? Hey, going back to what you guys were talking about during the day, What his grandson said is right. He thinks so too. So an adult should learn from the younger ones. Hehehe. Shit, I ain't doing this no more. You can talk tomorrow! Go to sleep! This serum has been extracted from plants originating in Japan. You smell it, and you die. But the chemicals that I developed neutralize the poison, which then becomes a terrific hallucinogen. Even made into gum or jelly for the cream of the crop. So we can sell them at the convenience store. Excellent. Good job! But I don't think you've done your part of the job. It's being dealt with. Wait. Bullshit, man. I ain't heard of fists that strong. You're so funny. So those trees got pulled out, And everyone else got a licking from pops. All the villagers ran away, And the remaining folks threatened with spears. The last battle was against a typhoon. Fighting against the rain and the wind, how could a man withstand that? It's nature he was fighting against, you see. I don't see the little kid. Someone came to visit him. Didn't know anyone would visit the fella. You see Chi-sung often? We're disappointed in him, if you know what I mean. He's up to something. We need someone like you around in times like this. You're in there, you know. Think what you can do for us in there. Mark my words. That guy you're familiar with... ain't the guy we know anymore. Sit down. We should have some coffee together. So, you were saying. Let's cut the crap and get to the point. Since when do slashers deal drugs? What is this, a conglomerate? I take a couple of years off after my leg got bad, and things have turned wild around here. If age is coming on ya, take off. It seems like our brother SUNG still has something to settle. I know our Chi-sung has done bad things to you, and I should have visited you to apologize, but I was busy, ya know. As I was saying, if age is coming on ya, take off. Why get advice from a crippled guy like me'? Shit, I haven't heard the whole story, but who the hell are you? A veteran from Vietnam? Stay out of this. Another hot temper, besides DONG Chi-sung, huh? Who're you? I'm the right-hand man. I think I just heard war, and from a ragpicker too. Hey asshole! Enough. I thought DONG Chi-sung was the right-hand guy. Already a replacement? I'm the right-hand guy. DONG was the left-hand guy. - I'm left handed. - Sir. So now that we've cleared which side is which, it's about time to clear the seats. That car with the disabled sticker on, I would think that's yours. Should I get my people to start the engine? I'm SUNG Bong-shik from Gwang-ju. I got stabbed seven times on my thighs by DONG, and became crippled. You guys stab on the legs when doing someone. We start with the arms. We went to see DONG's folks last night, And you could be next, right-hand guy. Take care. I'm leaving. No... no... no... Oh Fuck! How did you come about? I work nearby. Huh. I feel a little awkward. So you're still caddying at the club? They say it's bad for your skin, you know, pigeon layer or something gone bad. It's ozone. Yeah... So what's up? Chi-sung. Yeah. Listen carefully. Your father... No, your father and mother... both of them... They got stabbed, and they're in the hospital. That fucking temper. Shit I hate it. Say that again? Hear me out clearly the first time I say it! They got stabbed? But my folks ain't gangsters... Soon-tan. Do you get stabbed even if you're not a gangster? I can't... see you. So pull it out and go. Open UP the gates! Hurry! Who the fuck did it? Who fucking did DONG Chi-sung on his back, I'm fucking going to kill you! Let go, asshole! My friend, who fucking stabbed him? I'm fucking going to kill him! Let go, I Say! The poor bastard gets stabbed the day his folks get done! I'll kill the fucking asshole before the wound heals! Let go! I'm JUNG Soon-tan! I'm waiting for the day I die, dammit! I'm JUNG Soon-tan! PARK Moon-su. Come out. It ain't me. I ain't done it. I ain't stabbed anyone. I didn't do it, man. Come on, give me a break! Sir! I heard Chi-sung's at the hospital. Did you know? Hey asshole! He's been stabbed, and the one that did it is someone that we both know. Did you know? I think the boss did the right thing. The big guy taking care of the rest should be serene but wise. Let's just think that he did it for the sake of the company. Soon-tan getting death penalty. Was that also a wise decision? The company's in a bad state, so you and I will get stabbed as well? This isn't allowed, you know. 5 minutes. Period. Yeah, thanks a lot. Did you see my dad? He's on and off. SUNG Bong-shik did it'? I know what really ticks you off. I'm confused too. Do you know? Really? Your father gets hit. So what's the company doing? SUNG Bong-shik did the stabbing. So why stab on your back too? Go and tell them. Anyone related to my name. I'll go see them. Go tell. The bastards that know my name, or have called my name even once, I'll go see them all. Go tell. This... would not be the worst you've faced in your life. Do you really have to do that? Yeah, Chi-sung's still unconscious. He's a vegetable now. Saw him myself. Let's get the machines going. Is that resent I sense? Doing your closest friend? Why didn't you ask me? How could I watch someone else do my friend? You should've had me to do it. You always asked your right-hand guy to do it. Soon-tan, or Chi-sung. That's why they're in jail. I'm your right-hand guy now, so you should've told me to do it. Hello Sir! Hello Sir! SUNS Bong-skim CM 'Ms'? Did a couple of tables and fled. He must've taken care of the brewery too. We're not getting any booze at the bars near the rotary. The bastard! This means war! They're not registered. We won't have any problems as long as we don't hold them when we're caught. We're outnumbered, and we don't know what else will come at us? Times sure have changed. Now we won't have to train the kids no more. I'll go on a workshop with the top-tier guys. They'll need to learn how to use this. Air Force fighters will be training at midnight. Don't panic because of the noise. Tell you again. Air Force fighters will be training at midnight. Don't panic because of the noise. Chi-sung's back. It's Chi-sung. He's back! The condemned criminal above is to be executed... How do you feel? It hurts. How've you been? That tastes great. You're going? Tonight? Life's a promenade anyway. I regret doing this... I know it wasn't easy on you in here, me being a young guy in charge and all. In your next life, be a good man. Even if you do sin, be a clever man and don't get caught. Not knowing when I'll follow suit, I wish to go clean. Draw the most virtuous and beautiful picture on me. No one can punish me, so no one can forgive me. I wish to forgive myself... and be reborn. I want to die that way. I'm reborn. Let's get out of this place. Plans can change according to who's in or not. Excavating can't be done in a day or two, Through the ventilation tubes, we'll head to the sewerage. The sewerage will be complicated. Can we make it out? I've called on my guys. Don't worry. - My father? - He's fine. - Mother? - Fine as well. - My brother at Miari? - As usual. - Did Suk-ja give birth? - Yeah, twins. - How's my uncle? - Fine too. - And my aunt's store? - Earning tons. Brother-in-law? Got married again last week. What happened to my sister? - Getting married again next month. - Oh. Okay. It's the air base runway on this side. We can't go that way. And... the army base on this side. Let's go back. What, we're turning back? How come does army guys are around here when the DMZ's up there? Shit, man. Hey, Chi-sung. You gonna take the boss out when you're outta here? He said he was just gonna ask why he got dumped. Shit, you can give him a call to find that out. Hey, you've got the date set to die, so you've got nothin' to lose. I've got my reasons. I have to see my wife. Make it easier and have her come visit you. Hmmm. We don't really have to head out. Only three years left. Making a family tree. Ain't it awesome? We'll make up a new family like this! Bullshit. You like being a gangster? No, I just hate being a car thief. It's lonely, and not an easy job, you know. Don't get the wrong impression. There's no good gangster anywhere. Knights, justice... It's all bullshit. A gangster is just a gangster. Ditto for car thieves. Fuck! What is this? I heard you were doing something intriguing? Hey Chi-sung. I got four years left. I can't wait for that. Can you... count me in? Let's go the simple way. Tear down the walls. 50 meters left of the main entrance, they rebuilt it last year. They mixed sea sand on the concrete, so it's pretty weak, besides it's only two meters deep, and will go down if fifty of us rammed it Hey, the World Trade Center went down because they used sea sand! New York's by the sea. Will fifty people do? Should I gather a hundred? Go, go, go! This is the best solution. We dig during the night, and we'll get over the wall in a month's time. We should've done this the first place. Good job, GUYS-. I think we've reached the wall. A couple more days, and we'll get over it. We're planning to repair a few sectors of the penitentiary. A work team will be announced. With the modifications will come a shifting of rooms. Pack up and move to your new rooms after breakfast. Room 201 to 102 - Room 107 to 301. - What're they saying? Room 208 to 101. We have to start digging again on the new ground? We're on the second floor. Room 304 to 207. Excuse me! What do ya mean, we're changing rooms'? You don't even consult us and change rooms? Don't say a word. Excuse me! We need to talk about this. Let's talk! Did you have to do that? I didn't mean to tell them. The asshole... So there's no other way? That wall should've been torn down. A while longer and I'll be out of here anyway! Let's try the wall again. You'll get hurt. Stop it. That bastard's doing it again. What's wrong with the guy'? Go take a break! It's hot anyway. I got to work out, so mind your own business. I can't even shit these days. Hey doing that won't help you shit! Dammit. Why waste 30 minutes of break time on that? The most important thing is to overcome the fear of the trigger. You guys shout when you're using the knife, but with this, it's the opposite. Gently place your finger... That bastard, I've got to kill him first! Need anything? What do ya think we need? Are those guys seriously trying to bring down the wall? Overcome the fear of the trigger! Don't be scared of the trigger, dammit! Overcome the fear of the trigger! Overcome the fear of the trigger! Overcome the fear of the trigger! Overcome the fear of the trigger! The trigger... Overcome the fear of the trigger! Bravo, bravo! Delta! Delta! Bravo, bravo. I've been hit! I've been hit! Bravo! You Okay? Yeah I'm fine. Let's try it harder then. Okay. Shit. Shit, what's that? Hey, bring the fire extinguisher, quick! Run! Go! An F16 fighter crashed, and the outer walls of a penitentiary was brought down, causing a jail break that could only be true on film. The impact caused the wall to break down, and around 200 prisoners escaped, while the interception... 200 prisoners collided with around 40 warders trying to stop them, and as of this hour, 30 prisoners are still at large in the area. A task force between the military and the police... of around two thousand are searching the area. Meanwhile, the exact cause of the F16 crash and the collapsed wall, will be announced tomorrow. There have been no official announcements from the Ministry of Defence regarding the F16 crash, And also from the penitentiary regarding the collapse of the wall. Shit! Go away! Let me go home, bastards! PARK Moon-su, drop the knife! Drop your guns, assholes! Let me go home! It's over, drop it! One thing I'm sure of, is that I've been hit. So you formed a new organization in here. And you've planned the escape all along? Who's the boss? Peace Studio How to fine'? Yeah, I'm sorry. I got no time right now, okay? Yeah, I'll talk to you later. I got these from the cleaners. We can't walk around in these. Cleaners? Around the corner at the crossroads? My sister owns the place. Any others? Most of the 30 convicts that have escaped from Suncheon Penitentiary, have been captured by the military and police task force, but there still remains 5 uncaptured at this moment. These 5 have formed an organization with YOO Myung-shik as the boss called 'Love and Friendship' while in prison, and have prepared for the escape ever since. The organization's leader is YOO Myung-shik, and other members include Jl Moon-shik, JUNG Soon-tan, DONG Chi-sung, and HWANG Chul-hee. It has been revealed by police investigation that they will settle in Busan, once they succeed in fleeing. JANG Nak-young, that bastard! - You're the boss... - Shut! You look better in person. The picture on TV. Don't understand why they used that kind of picture. Poor lighting and all. Do you think we say cheese when taking a picture in jail? We could call this destiny. That thing you're wearing... It's mine. Oh shit. It fits you perfectly. Fucking bastard, told him I wouldn't wear these. Uh. Say hi. Cut the crap. Nice meeting you guys, I'm YANG Yeo-il. Is this the "Love and Friendship" guys'? We didn't name it like that. You're still alive? Long time no see. I can see a bloodshed coming. I've been to prison, so I won't be rough. Forget it. Here's the money and a cell phone. The map indicating the factory your people are running. The address of the place they've moved to. You've now got a girl on your team? - I, uh, I own this place. - What is this now? Love and friendship and peace? You got all the good things in your name, huh? Let's talk outside. Yeah. Come on, let's go. I'll be outside for a moment. No wonder you're a gangster, you always go around in bunches. You wander alone, you're a fighter. You walk in a group, you're a gangster. You really want to be the boss, huh? If that's what you're thinking, do it the right way. Thanks, by the way. And once I get enough of the outside world and go back to where I belong, forget about me. Good lines. Good emotions too. You're the actor. Well, yeah, I was planning to do that. Forget about you. Yeah. Take care. Don't go to your father. Cops are swarming over there. You going straight to the boss? It's best to get over it while it's still on your mind. Let's go our own ways. It's my business. Nothing like kids fighting in a mob. You take the wrong step and you'll end up dead. Dammit, I'm not trying to look cool, it's just the way it is! Shit. Whatever. This guy's an ass sometimes. He was born an ass. Can't help it. Can you take me to my wife? Shit, who comes to a place like this to meet his wife? Does an escape coming to a jail to visit his wife make sense? Is it true that the brother over there did someone and ate his flesh? What is he, Hector Cannibal? You look smarter. How've you been? You wife's head of the room in here. Beating up on the cheeky ones. I'm proud of you. I didn't think of seeing you till we die. Looks like you're here for my birthday. Oh yeah, your birthday. I thought so. You're not the remembering type. You get more beautiful with age. I know. Cheeky bitch. Sorry. This should be the last time I see you. Should I come again tomorrow? Don't get caught. You should stay here. I'm... a killer too. A bit old, but still with something left in the tank. Hide yourself if we're not out in 10 minutes. Sir. We've heard about you coming out. How should we take care of you? Fucking assholes, asking me questions like that. You assholes! I thought DONG Chi-sung was already dead. We need to rebuild the whole shift. Mr. KIM, you sure don't know how to run the business. Just to tell you what's going on, deal's over. I mean over. Professor CHOI. Professor CHOI! Save what's left of you. You'll be the one seeing Chi-sung first. Let me ask you something. Let's be a little fair now. I'm crippled over here. I said I want to ask you something, asshole! Okay, okay. What is it? Fucking bastard, how could a fucking gangster like you... - Green light, brother. - Huh'? Fuck it. You bastard! I've arranged for you to leave tomorrow. Cops will be intervening soon. You should stay out of sight for a couple of months. Am I trying to avoid the cops? It all comes down to the last moment. What I do just before I die, that's what defines my life. Fuck it, all that's left is a piece of paper with an address. There's no car anywhere near here. Oh, man. How are you coping? Enough to do what I've got to do. Is that why you're here, alone? All I got to see is one person. These fucking bastards only run like hell. Asshole. That's quite a lot. You don't handpick the kids anymore? Look at that guy over here. What's that, a pipe or a fishing rod? What's this? Who are you going to beat up with this shit? You came fishin' sonny? Fuck it. Kids are this bad nowadays. Can't you just go? Thought you knew me better. Put down the weapons, you shitheads. Shit. Don't move. I said don't move, dammit! Just stay over there, okay? Fuck. Stay out of it because you'll get hurt, asshole! Whatcha doing? Kill the guy! I said don't move, dammit! Fight me! Let go! - I said fight me! - Let go! - Come on! - I said let go! Fight me! Let go, asshole! Fucking assholes! Come over here, bastards! Already in action? I'm JUNG Soon-tan. Nice to meet you guys! That bastard! Stay out of this. It's my business. You push. And I'll pelt. Don't cross the line right here. You won. You won, so quit it. You won. Shoot, asshole. Stop, man. Shoot the damn thing, I'm tired. I'm sorry. I work... for this company. Sorry. Joo-joong, you asshole! Wake up, dammit! Long time no see. A gangster uses a knife or his fists when doing someone. Not his mouth. Back there, when you and Soon-tan were fighting. It looked great, you know. Just like the old times. It looked great. Stop talking, man. I got... death penalty anyway. It'll be hard on you guys. We can't stay together now? You look like a boss to me. You look like shit. You're my boss. You're my fucking boss, dammit! Look at you, you poor bastard! Is that why you've tried to do me? To show me that stupid face of yours? You bastard. You fucking bastard! Joe-bong, what cm you do'? Wake up, man. Wake up, you asshole! Jooqoong! Wake up, you asshole! Just popped up my mind... Since we've been friends, I don't recall any day that rained. You know that ain't possible. I wonder why I can '1' think of such a day... Yeah... We couldn't possibly have clear sky all the time. It must've rained and breezed. I don't remember us getting wet. You think so too? Strange as hell... Yeah. Really... Yeah... Do we have to do this? Come one, man. Shit, this feels uncomfortable. How do we stand? Shit! I can't feel my bottom half. Which leg is taped up? The right one. I can't remember... Which leg was the crippled one? The left.
