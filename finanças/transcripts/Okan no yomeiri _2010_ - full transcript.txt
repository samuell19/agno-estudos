Kadokawa Pictures The Morii family: Yoko, Tsukiko and Hachi the dog HERE COMES THE BRIDE, MY MOM! Tsuki! Tsuki! Tsuki! I'm back. Tsuki! Surprise! Hey, girl, wake up! Tsuki! - Tsuki! - No way! Tsuki, hey! Tsuki! Tsuki! - Where are you? Open up... - Enough. I'm coming. Stop it, Saku is going to be mad. Tsuki! Mum... Who is it? I'm back. Who is this man? I told you... It's a surprise! Surprise? Yes, it's my surprise. But... But what? It's Ken, he's with me... I'm so sleepy... Hang on... Are you alright? Get off the floor, you're going to catch a cold. Good morning. I... Don't go in there just yet... the smell... Forgot to zip it up... Apologies. I have to go walk the dog. Make yourself comfortable. Nice dog... Such a pretty dog... Hachi! Come here! Come back soon! Marvellous weather. Indeed... When this time...? When what? When did Yoo come back this time? About 12. I think, it was about 3 again. For God's sake... Let's go. - Good morning. - Good morning to you too. Hachi! It's nice that you're back. Come in... Ken has prepared all of this. Ken works as a chef. Have you washed your hands? What is all this? It's delicious. Let's sit down to the table. What is all this? It's fried caviar. No way! Good morning. Here's stewed turnip. Try some. Who are you? This is Ken. This is our landlady, Saku. My name is Yoko Morii. Last night, he, Kenji Hattori, proposed to me... And I said yes. Seriously? Pleased to meet you! Oh, excuse me, I have to be going already! Have a nice day. Take care. I will. And how old are you? 30. 30? Yes. Hahaha! 30? It's true. Please, leave. It's 9 o'clock AM. Thank you for listening to us. Greetings from Yuka Yoshimi. The first thing I want to tell you is... that I turned 33 today. That's why we've had cheerful music since the start of the day. And since the early morning, I've been getting happy birthday wishes. My co-workers have already wished me happy birthday. Who will be the next? Hello! What do you want to say? MURAKAMI ORTHOPAEDIC CLINIC How are you today? I have a knee ache... Here, apply some ice. It should help. Give me your name, birthdate and home address... Can you write it down here? Does it hurt here? No. What about here? No. Well, everything is okay. You can pitch in tomorrow's game. Great! What's up? Lack of confidence? Do you want me to teach you how to deal with that? You have to recite an incantation before throwing the ball. As soon as you get in the position, say 'crane and turtle'. Crane and turtle? Twice, with all your heart... 'Crane and turtle'. 'Crane and turtle'? Exactly. Like that. Indeed, Shota, it's an ancient invocation, but it's absolutely useless. What are you talking about? It has always helped me. Even without that invocation, you'll deliver a great ball. Come on. Thank you very much. - Not at all... - Good luck. What happened? Give it to her. Why don't you do it yourself? I want you to do it. Have you had an argument or what? Well, what is it? She's getting married. Who? Mum. No way! It's true. You must be joking! I'm not! To whom? He's a blonde and he wears a red jacket. Haha, I can't believe it. He's 30. Maybe, she wants to play a joke on me? Who? Yoo? Yes. What's this smell? It's my secret. - Can I taste it? - Later! - It's not done yet! Well, OK. Pass me the sugar... No. This is salt. Is it? I'm sorry. Here's the sugar. What? Didn't you understand what I said? Sorry. Alright. OK then, when Tsuki comes, we'll all eat together. As you want. You're here... Kenji? Good afternoon... that is, good evening. Do you know each other? He's a grandson of one of our patients. Right. Unbelievable! You're a great cook. This is for you, Yoko. Thank you. Here you are. Tsuki, come have a drink with us. Thank you. Tsuki, what are you doing there? Come here. Here you go. So... you can congratulate us. Ken and me. Yoko, what do you have in your cup? Seaweed water. Why? I had too much to drink last night. At your age? Cheers! Bottoms up! Cheers! Bon appetit! Bon appetit! Are these aralia sprouts? Yes. It's great. Absolutely delicious. - You really like it? - Yes. This is also very tasty. - Thank you very much! - Is this rockfish? - It's rockfish with seaweed. - And what is this? Torigai seashells with green onion, mustard, vinegar and miso. Tsuki, try it. It's delicious. Listen, why have you started to dress like this? I liked the way you looked before just fine. Really? It can't be true... Why are you looking like this? How is she? - Sorry? - Well, you know. How is she? Hey! It hurt. Mind your own business. How long have you been going out? Again? Why are you so sensitive? What is there to be shy about? Stop it. There's no secret. We started going out 3 years ago. 3 years ago? Yes. Are you sure you're not mistaken? Yes... So long ago? Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't even suspect... 3 years... And why have you decided to get married all of a sudden? Well... Grandma died recently and... What? It happened so unexpectedly... She had a stroke. She lost consciousness and never regained it... I thought about her recently, and I had a strange feeling... Don't worry, it's fine. She was already very old. So we decided... to live here together. Oh no! Everything is dirty now. - What? - Are you alright? I don't have a lot of things at all. Only one cardboard box and grandma's pickling tub. These pickles are from that tub. Enough! Stop it! Why? Why do you care only about yourself? What did I do to deserve this? I can't believe this. Tsuki, wait... Tsuki! Doctor... Everything is fine. No, it's not fine. OK, it's not. Saku, can you put me up for the night? What happened? Tsukiko, what happened? Tsuki! Tsuki... Do you want Ken to leave? You don't want him to live in our house? Tsuki! Tsuki, where are you going? Don't you dare do that! Give it back to me! It's mine! Give it back! We've gone mad. Haha, Tsuki, you're so strong and stubborn. Why are you laughing? Please, give me my Kaoru back. No! Give it back, it's very important for mum. How can you say that now? After you've brought that man and decided to marry him and live together? You should be ashamed of yourself! Tsuki! It's ridiculous... Tsuki! Are you jealous? Not at all. I just feel sorry for him. He died before you were born. Why do you say that? You're right. Forgive me. She used to say, 'Kaoru is my first and last man'. Now I see that those were nothing but words. It's not true. It was unbearable for her to remember that car accident. Everything was destroyed in one moment. They've been together for 3 years. Really? All this time, she has fooled us. So she's kept silent about it for 3 years. Oh! What is it? Hachi! Hachi, are you hungry? What is it, Hachi? There's only rice bran left here. I should take them out. What did you feed him with? With rice and miso soup. You don't know what you're doing. Here's a bag of dogfood for Hachi. The vet said to give him only this kind. But I don't think rice can do him any harm. Nonsense! Even if everything you said is true, you shouldn't take it so seriously. Right, Iida? If one person said it, it doesn't mean that it's true. Remember Terada? She also became neurotic. Not only Terada. Tanabe too. Her husband was transferred to the Tokyo office, and she fell into a strange state. She then recited sutras for a whole year to recover. I almost died laughing. She did recover her health, but not the money. - You should be crying, not laughing here. - Here I am. - Welcome. - Thanks. Well, thank you for everything. Mi, are you coming? Yes. Leaving already? I have to get home soon to make dinner. You haven't done it yet? I started it, but haven't finished. I see. Will you eat with us? No, Ken is waiting for me. Are you just going to leave like this? Yes, I have to. Tsuki... Ken has moved in, but there will be only you and me at home tonight. He'll be sleeping in the garden. In the garden? How do you imagine that? It's freezing out there. That's true. So, Tsuki, come back to us... No. It's jealousy. Not at all! Hachi, outside! You're back. Tsuki... Good morning. Let's go. Hachi needs to go outside, doesn't he? I didn't mean anything bad. Once is not a big problem, is it? I'm sorry... It's just that... I don't want strangers to walk him. I see. I'm sorry. Are you alright? Today, a new employee... has joined the department of corporate planning. The owners are hoping to get great results. I hope you are all interested in the success. I'm Motohashi, from the headquarters. Nice to meet all of you. Mori! Yes? Will you bring Motohashi up-to-date? Of course. And now - a break. I'm leaving. - Yes, it's late. - It's time to go home. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Excuse me... - Yes? I suggest we eat octopus doughnuts. What? Well... Would you like to eat octopus doughnuts with me in Osaka? Alright. 'The best in Japan'... 'The best in the world"... 'The best in the Universe'... What should we choose? It's hard... Welcome! Of course, 'The best in Japan' ones are tasty. But 'The best in the world' and 'The best in the Universe' are even tastier. I agree. Really? Everything is great here - the management, the food... That's true. Next time, we'll find something other than octopus. We'll sit and relax in a normal restaurant. - Good morning. - Morning. Dear Tsukiko! Why are you avoiding me? Please, leave. Leave me alone! Excuse me. May I? Are you laughing at me? You think I'm stupid? Are you injured? I'm fine. I'm ready to go to work. No, Muri can cope alone just fine. I'm fine, really. Thanks for asking. Are you sure? This Motohashi is under house arrest. He's not allowed to go outside. Everything will be alright. Since you have sustained injuries, Mori, Motohashi's family is prepared to pay damages. Besides, our company also feels responsible. Motohashi said he wanted to talk to you. He said he was very sorry. But I'm against you meeting with him. What are you going to do? I'll get back. What? Since I'm fine, I'll get back to work tomorrow. Attention! The train is arriving at platform 2. The train is arriving at platform 2. Be careful! Do not cross the yellow line! Of course not. Yoo... has to marry doctor Murakami. I'm disappointed. After all, that blonde guy... is so young. I'm so jealous... She's up. You, sleepyhead! Oh, it's amberfish. Where are you going? To take a bath. What about dinner? Later. When later? This year, a lot of people are suffering from allergies again. Let's talk about it. Are you sneezing? Do you have a runny nose? Are you feeling terrible? You don't understand what is causing your allergy? Our today's guest... also suffers from allergies. It's musician Takashi Sugizaki. What a surprise! I've come to take a bath. Hachi? Hachi! Hachi! Hachi! Tsuki! What happened? Something happened to Hachi... Hachi! Hachi! A stone has got stuck in the urethra. Right now it's inside the penis. Soon, the urinary bladder will fill up, and the stone will come out with urine. We just have to wait. Cooking OKONOMI-YAKI (Japanese pizza) All a dog can do is bark. It's difficult to understand if it's in pain. Let's eat. - Bon appetit! - Help yourselves. You're a cook, aren't you? Yes. I used to work in my grandma's store. What do you do now? Nothing. Unemployed? Yes. But... I'm looking for a job. Who's going to hire you looking like this? You're right. You look like a scarecrow! I'm sorry... I don't need your apologies. Do you like this? No one forces you to dress like this, do they? No... So why did you quit your job as a cook? It was a stupid thing to do. Because my grandma died. She died, but the store was still there, wasn't it? Well, there were various reasons. What reasons? Are you in conflict with your relatives? Is that it? You're so persistent... But I received grandma's pickling tub. It's enough for me. You may be satisfied, but you still don't have a job. That's true. What about you, Tsukiko, are you going to keep procrastinating much longer? You have to find a job as soon as possible. Time flies. Until both of you solve this problem... I can't relax. Pass me the mayo. How much longer are you going to sleep in the garden? It's almost winter. It's ridiculous. But it's for Tsuki's sake. Because Tsuki sleeps inside. But it's not Tsukiko's house. This house, that house, the garden you sleep in... it's all mine. Neither Tsukiko, nor Yoko or anyone else need it. Is that right, Tsukiko? Tsukiko? Let him do as he pleases. If he freezes to death, even better. What a charming child! - A bit more to the right. - To the right? No, not that much. Right here? Or here? Yes, right there. Don't forget to give some okonomi-yaki to Yoo. Sakura is in bloom so early this year... Thank you. Today... the two of you had a nice conversation... Ken is very happy. Here's a bit of okonomi-yaki. Saku made it for you. Thank you. Will you eat with me? Excuse me! Have you come to take a bath? No. You wanted to talk, didn't you? We're very glad to receive guests... This shampoo is very expensive. I'm sorry. Is it expensive? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I... Forgive me. Are you joking? Not at all. You're not? So you're serious then... Are you jealous? Silly girl... Here... Doctor, it's all because of your negligence. What? Because you were dragging your feet. That's why it happened. What happened? That's why she started an affair, because you were too slow and evasive. It's biting! Tsuki! What is it? It's from Universal Studios. Cute, aren't they? So fluffy... It was a lot of fun. We saw Jaws and Jurassic Park. It was so loud. Fire shooting up from everywhere. - And also this... - Who? This well-known... - Spiderman... - Ah! We had a great time! - You know... - Yes, my girl? What is it? What you said then... What? Tell me, please. I don't know if I should... Don't be afraid. Are you really getting married? Really. The doctor is so nice, though. What are you talking about? You love him so much? This man... Why, all of a sudden... Yes, I love him. Maybe, he's a bit weird... Weird? He has so many issues... He doesn't want them to be noticed... That's why he behaves in a silly way. What issues? Issues with his relatives... - You mean his grandma dying? - He's a foster child. His real parents... died in a car accident. Tsuki, may I... What? Put on a white dress? A white dress? Yes, a white wedding dress. A wedding dress? Yes. Since I was a child, I've been dreaming to put on a real white dress for my wedding. You think it's stupid? Of course, it is. Utter shamelessness. OK. It was a joke. Forget it. Hachi, home! Hachi! - Boom! - Closed! - Ajar. Idiots... What's going on with you? You know... What is it? Nothing. What's wrong with you, damn it! A white dress? Exactly. But... it's the right thing to do on such an occasion. Your mum is starting a new life, we should congratulate her. Doctor, so you don't mind? What do you mean? You think, I haven't tried to win your mother's love? But I failed. Although I tried twice... But the time wasn't appropriate. You were the reason for my failure. At 25, Yoko didn't want to know anything except her Tsuki. At that time, Tsuki was the most important thing in the world for her. You were number one for her. It's true. Yoo... She's your mother and, at the same time, she's a woman... Until now, she seemed to have forgotten about it. And she genuinely thought that she was happy. Don't worry, everything will be alright. I'm always with you. No. Not that blonde guy. Not the blonde guy? But he looks like James Dean. - James Dean? - Yes. Who's that? Surely, you know who he is! Welcome back. James Dean? No? I don't get it. Why do you look like James Dean? Grandma wanted to meet James Dean very much. After grandma had fallen ill and lost touch with reality, she once regained consciousness and said, 'I'd really like to meet James Dean.' Why? I don't know. She didn't know what she was talking about. I thought I'd imagined it. But since then, every time she regained consciousness, she would repeat the same phrase. And then she didn't regain consciousness anymore. So I never found out what she meant. And I still don't know... I'm sorry. You have nothing to apologize for. I guess, you're right. Excuse me... Yes, and one more thing... I don't mind a white dress. Tell mum that. Well? It's too watery. Is it? Seems just right to me. Really? Tsukiko, what do you think? It's fine. I'm so happy. About what? White suits me so well. Isn't it too expensive? Tsuki, will you go with me? To get a dress. You and I, we'll get on a train and go together. It's not necessary. But it's better to go together... It's not better at all. Tsuki... It will be so nice. We'll get on a train... and we'll go together... I understood everything the first time... If you did, then why are you being stubborn? Tsuki, be a nice girl. It's very important for mum. Do it for me. There will be a lot of strangers there. I want to feel confident and strong among them. That's why I'm asking you. I get it! I heard you... What I don't understand is, how such an intelligent person as you, can behave like this. Why are you still... behaving in such a silly way, and now, on top of that, you've started this conversation. It's not sudden. I've been thinking about it for a long time. I was in your way. You wanted to get married, and I was in your way. What are you talking about... I'm an obstacle for you. You want me to go away and leave the two of you alone. That's why you've started this conversation. You can hit me, it's useless. Let me go! - No. - Let me go! - Leave me alone! - No! Get married if you want! Put on a white dress if you want! - Let me go! - No way! Until you agree to come with me, I'm not letting you go! Let go of me! No! Tsuki! May I? Can I come in? Yoko says you're a smart person. And, on the contrary, she thinks I'm stupid. So what? Nothing. There's nothing surprising about that... The fact that my grandma died, is only half of the truth. The other half is that, it was my fault. Unfortunately, in the morning of that day... we had an argument about buying a new store. I stormed out, angry. I didn't go to the store and got drunk instead. I came home only the next morning. Grandma wasn't there. I was worried, and went to the store to look for her. My grandma... was lying face down on the cash desk... If I'd known that it would happen, that she could die so suddenly... But she's not here anymore, and I'll never see her again... I won't be able to ask for forgiveness. I'm so sorry for what I did. Please, leave. Good morning. Hello. Hey! Wake up. - Good morning. - Hello. Come on. They're leaving. Tell them goodbye yourself. Come on, get up. Good morning! Why are you screaming so loudly so early in the morning? We're going to get a wedding dress. I see. Take care. She's out of sorts. Good morning, Saku. Good morning. Let's go then. Are you okay? Yes. Yoko! What is it? Yoko, what's wrong with you? Yoko, hang on! She's slightly anemic. It's the only symptom so far... Your mother forbid me to talk about it. But you're her only relative. So I decided that you have to know. About 2 months ago... she complained of a sense of discomfort in her stomach. We ran some tests. And discovered... here, in the ovary... a malignant tumor. But... what is particularly bad... is that the tumor has spread onto the lungs and the liver. Radical surgery... is not an option in this case. If the illness continues to develop in the same way, she'll have about a year. If regular chemotherapy is conducted, a bit longer. Besides, your mum... has such a strong will to live these days, that it might help to prolong her life. Unfortunately, we don't have much of a choice. You knew everything all along? Why didn't you tell me before? Why didn't you tell me? Don't blame Ken. He didn't do anything wrong. It was me... I made the decision alone. It's selfish. You're right. I'm a very egotistic person. But don't... be so bummed out. We're all tired as it is. So don't. Are you insane? Have you thought about Tsukiko? Have you thought about me? Don't you care about anyone at all? Saku is upset. Why... Why... There's nothing we can do now. Nothing... How's Yoo? Both of you, Yoko and Tsukiko, you only see specks in each other's eyes. Tsukiko! Tsukiko! Don't. You mustn't cry. Nothing has changed. You're her only relative. You have to support mum. Do you understand? I'm listening. Tsuki? Where are you now? Are you listening to me? Tsuki! Yes. I woke up, but there was no one around. Where are all of you? Hello! Tsuki, can you hear me? Yes, I hear you. There's nothing to do here, so I took up knitting. It's a great pastime. I decided to knit a glove. But when I finished, it had 6 fingers. You must be joking! Tsuki! Can I ask you a question? Why did you tell everything to him alone? At first, I didn't want to tell Ken anything. I didn't want him to know... and decided that we had to split up. That's what I told him, 'Let's just split up...' But it was as if Ken hadn't heard anything. Instead, he proposed to me. He said, 'Yoko, I want to spend my whole life with you. Will you marry me?' And I said, 'It would be better for us to split up.' But he said, 'Let's get married!' Ken... looked at me with his eyes wide open and said, 'You're the person I want to spend 100 years with.' And I said, 'I only have 1 year left to live.' And he said, 'I want to spend it with you, Yoko.' What could I do? I was so happy. Incredibly happy... I wanted so bad to spend the rest of my life with this man. I really want it very much. I would have wanted you to have told me also. If you had told me, I would have taken your man... more seriously. And I would have accepted him sooner. Would you have accepted death as well? It's not something to laugh about... Cooking bento? Yes. All the vitamins are in the skin. This bento... I want to take it to the hospital, to give mum. Looks delicious! Bon appetit! Yummy. When you finish eating... Let's go... get a white dress together? Let's get on a train together... and go get a white dress? Tsuki, isn't it too heavy for you? No. I'm alright! Crane and turtle. Crane and turtle. Crane and turtle, crane and turtle. Attention! The train is arriving at platform 2. Do not cross the yellow line! Crane and turtle, crane and turtle. Crane and turtle, crane and turtle. Crane and turtle, crane and turtle. Tsuki! Well, how is it? It's great... Don't lie to me. Can I come out? Just a minute... Can I do it now? Yes, go ahead. Well? So pretty! What is it? Tsuki... I'd like to thank you, from the bottom of my heart. For what? I gave birth to you... We lived together... It brought me a lot of happiness. I didn't tell you... about Ken... or about my illness. I'm asking you to forgive me. After Kaoru died, I've fallen in love for the first time. This man has become the most desired one for me. I wanted my daughter to be the first to know. But every time I wanted to tell you, something stopped me. I never managed to tell you. And then, I learnt about my illness. I found out that I had little time left to live. All my hopes were shattered. I didn't know what to dedicate... my remaining days to. And I thought that now... I had to... fill my life with happiness. I wanted my daughter to see me happy. This way, I'll be able to show Tsuki... the right way to live as well. That's what I thought to myself. Tsuki, whatever mum does... in her blind selfishness, please... until my last day, please... stay by my side... I beg you. Well, that's all I wanted to say. Well... Enough... I'm sorry. Mum, I... I promise, I'll be by your side. I'll be with you... Forgive me. Let's not ask forgiveness anymore. Alright. You've stained your dress. Indeed. Is it better now? Is it done? Yes... Now stir it. Oh yes. When you're done stirring, fry it in a pan in sesame oil. Wait, I'm not done yet. I'm still stirring... Why are you saying this to me? Excuse me... I'm done now. Pour it into the pan and add sesame oil. Oh yes. Hachi, home! Welcome back. We're back. Come here. Careful! - Hello. - Good morning! Good morning, Hachi. - Good morning. - Hello. Would you like stewed fish? - With pleasure. - Here. Yummy. So delicious. - Are you done? - Yes. Tsuki, be careful so that it doesn't burn. Yes-yes. I also have KIMPIRA-GOHO. (sweet sote from root crops) Good morning. Hello. What happened, doctor? I think I left my glasses here yesterday. - Where did I put them? - Glasses? Nothing here. - Good morning. - Hello. - What happened? - I can't find my glasses. Here's kimpira-goho and umeboshi plums. - Thank you. - Thank you. - How disagreeable... - What's wrong, doctor? I think I left my glasses here yesterday. Are you kidding? No, I'm actually upset. Hachi, let me wipe your paws. What is that under the table? Your glasses.
