RADIO DJ: This is KFYI. And I'm the Raver. Tonight, we're going to talk about a rumor that's running rampant on the streets of LA, a rumor that somebody has revived the old Roman gladiator games. It seems that every two years or so, the gangs in this city call a truce to go to these so-called games. Well, are they real? Or just another LA street myth? Give us a call. We want to know. Line 1, you're on the air with the Raver. CALLER: It's crap. Roman games? Come on, man. This is the '80s. [cheering] (CHANTING) Fight! Fight! Fight! [gun shot] [music playing] [gun shot] [screaming] [gun shots continue] [sirens] [crying] The shock and pain of East LA's latest in a series of brutal drive-by killings is still very evident here at Willow Park, where a birthday party was being held for 13-year-old Juanito Santiz. It is alleged that this terrible incident is some sort of gang related shooting. Police have confirmed six dead, all young Hispanics in their early to late teens, including young Juanito Santiz. Only two of the dead were known to be gang members. With me now is Sergeant Carl Summers of the LAPD Crash Unit. Sergeant, we have unconfirmed reports that this shooting is somehow related to the recent rash of drug murders that have been taking place in East LA. Can you help us substantiate these reports? Well, at this time, we have nothing support those rumors. All's we know it was a blue or gray sedan with four men, possibly members of a rival gang. And they were all carrying assault type weapons. We also have rumors that there is some sort of gang war being waged between two rival factions in this area. Could this incident have anything to do with that? We're investigating all possibilities. But at this time, there is no motive for the shooting. One more question, Sergeant. Is there any truth to the rumor that there are some kind of gang games? Games where fights between gang members are fought to the death? Listen, I have nothing further to say at this time. Thank you, Miss. - Thank you, Sergeant. Juanito. Baby, why? Why? [speaking spanish] He was so young. Please. Please don't cry. Oh, Paulo. Please. You won't let them take you, please. Please! Of course. Miguel? I want to talk to you. You gonna bust me, Rodriguez? Why? Did you do something wrong? Not yet, man. You know who did this. Look, Rodriguez. If you ain't gonna bust me, then I got to go now. Paulo? You OK? Yeah. I'm fine. Who did this? I don't know. Dammit, Paulo! I'm-- on your side. REPORTER: The horror of death has again struck in East LA, this time taking six young lives, who just wanted to have a good time to celebrate a friend's birthday. The name of Juanita Santiz was once written on a birthday cake. Now it must be inscribed on a tombstone. I'm Michel Lane for Channel 7 in East Los Angeles. RADIO DJ: Line 4, your on the air with the Raver. CALLER: Yeah. I just heard about that kid that got killed in the drive by tonight. RADIO DJ: Yeah. Real shame. CALLER: Yeah. The news said something about some kind of gang games. You ever hear about anything like that? RADIO DJ: Yeah, two years ago. But these punks don't need any kind of games to kill each other. All they need is a gun. All we can do is hope the body count doesn't include too many innocent victims. Jose. Pedro. Carlos. Juanito. Lefty. My Leticia. [spanish] For what? Because Juanito Santiz had a birthday? We pay back tonight, man! Hey, Hector man. I think-- Shut up, wannabe! You don't talk! You ain't got no fucking say, ese. You ain't in the click, man. Yo, man. I can't say! My brother, Carlos, died because of the games. People died because of Los Lobos. You ain't in the gang, ese. Unless you think you're ready. Listen, wannabe. Anybody fucks with us, they better be ready to bang, man. Now if you want say, then you get jumped in now. Otherwise, you shut the fuck up, man. We keep the truce. [speaking spanish] If we let this go, the fuckers will think we're cowards, man. Are you [spanish], Miguel? Are you making a challenge? You want a knife? [spanish] Guns? All right, man. We wait for the games, man. The Lobos rule, man. Viva Los Lobos! [tires screeching] (CHANTING) Lobos! Lobos! Lobos! Lobos! [spanish] Rodriguez! Go. Go. [tires screech] Dammit, Miguel! I'm getting too old for this shit! Miguel! God dammit. I just want to talk to you. I'm definitely too old for this shit. Stone. You messed up that hit. All those dead bodies. And no Paulo Santiz. I thought we got him. You think? I pay you not to think. Just to do. We'll go back. We'll get him. Nobody! Nobody break [inaudible] the [inaudible] truce. Nobody. You take care of this at the games. You understand me? OK. At the games. At the games. MARIA: Are you OK? - Yeah. MARIA: No, you're not. I've been the leader of the Lobos for five years now. There's always been turf wars gang-bangers getting hurt and killed. But now there's no sense to anything anymore. What world are we living in? Why do you stay in the gang, Miguel? Es familia. Why do you want a family like that? Where is the pride in knowing that your family has killed the most children or taught them to kill, sold the most drugs or sent most of its members to jail? Why is it such a proud thing to be in jail? It's where society sends its trash. Why do you want to be trash? Why are you here if I'm trash? There is nothing else for me or any vato. The Anglo's control everything, everything except the gangs. And the drugs? That controls them. And you? Juanito Santiz was only 12. All we wanted to be was 13, and now he he's dead! Why, Miguel? Por que? I can't stay here with you anymore. I'm tired of being afraid. I'm tired of having to watch and be careful where I go, what I do, what I say. I'm tired of your stupid world and it's stupid killing! I want to join the real world. Go ahead then! Go on, get out! Go find yourself some [inaudible] and become a good little coconut! Better that than being a little boy that's only playing at being a man. Dios mio. Maria, I'm sorry. Forgive me. [spanish] I know. I know. It's OK. I love you too. It's OK, sweetheart. It's OK, baby. [music playing] PRIEST: Father, into your hands we commend our brother, Juanito. Eternal rest, grant it to him, Oh Lord. And let perpetual light shine upon him. May his soul and the souls of the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace. In the name of the Father, of the son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Amen. [organ music playing] Paulo, you're going to be late for work. PAULO: Yeah, mama. I know. Can you go to the store for me after work? PAULO: OK. [inaudible] Here's a li-- why must you dress like that? To survive. Survive? What good did it do your brothers? What good did it do your father? Mama, please. Don't start. Do you think it's macho to be in a gang? It's not macho. That doesn't make you a man. You're just lying to yourself that you're a man until you become a dead boy. I'm late. Hey, man. You're on [inaudible] turf and you're wearing Lobo colors. You must be one stupid mother fuck! You're late. I know, Mr. Montana. I ran into a slight problem on my way to work. You OK, son? Yeah, I'm fine. You sure? Yeah, Mr. Montana. Really, I'm fine. [spanish] Sorry about your brother. Thanks. Well, if you're OK, then I guess you better change clothes, go to work, and-- why don't you take section three? OK. [inaudible]. Thanks. Check it out. You know who that is? Uh-uh, man. Who is it? You shitting me, ese? [inaudible], man. The snow man. That's [inaudible] That's the vato who does the games, man. [inaudible] gentlemen. You know what you must do? You must go take care of him, like you always do, and you'll have a fine tip. What do you want? To thank you for this morning. You're welcome. How did you find me? I asked around. [speaking spanish] I want to learn to fight like you. Go away. Why? Because I say so. But I want to learn. I want to learn. I won't teach you. Go away. [speaking spanish] Gracias, Paulo. Dinner will be ready soon. OK, mama. I'm hungry. Paulo, what happened? Nothing. Look at me! Why is your face all bruised? You joined the ganga, didn't you? No, mama! [spanish] Paulo! Paulo? Mama, please. Go away. Paulo, I want to talk to you. [spanish] I don't want to talk! I just want to be left alone! [spanish] [tranquil music] That's beautiful, man. Why are you following me? You know why. I told you, no. Why not? Because you don't need to learn. But I'm going to be jumped, because of the Lobos. Go get a gun, and be like all the other punks. I'm not a punk! I'm a warrior for the Lobos! Almost. You are a punk almost. What's the difference between a punk and a warrior? A warrior will develop his weapon. A punk would rather just have one handed to him. Where [inaudible] Now go away, as I asked you to. Is this the [inaudible] residence? MAN (ON PHONE): Si. Well, son of a bitch. - Anything else? - No. Gracias. OK. Hola, [inaudible]. You're still eating those things, eh? [chuckling] Thank you for coming. It's OK. How are you? How's your knee? It's working. Are ya hungry? No. Just the coffee, please. [speaking spanish] Been a long time. Yeah. I thought you went back to the [inaudible].. I came back home. Look, I know I should have stayed in touch. You did what you had to. You got out. Time's change. People change. I'm sorry about Loretta. She's with God. Gracias. How about you? I'm a cop. I used to be a warlord of the Lobos. But I swore I'd get out of the barrio, and I did. I jumped from one war zone right into another. After 'Nam, I figured, what the hell? If I've got to go on fighting the wars, I might as well fight for something that matters. So I joined the force. Later, I transferred to the crash unit. But before I retire, I wanted to do something for the old neighborhood. I figure maybe I can make a difference, because I lived here once. I'm trying to get a lead on Chesare. You'll never get him. He is too smart, like Zorro. He likes mucho dinero. I remember when he was just a punk with a gun. Now he's one of the biggest dealers in the city. And he runs the games, so he can recruit more and more kids into the organization. But I know I've been away from the barrio too long. I need your help. No, Eddie. Why? Because I still live in the barrio. You want me to become a [spanish] for you? Come on, man. Nobody's going to call you an informer. Aurelio, don't you remember when we used to stand side by side in [inaudible] until they dropped? All we did. But once that happened, it was over. We'd go home. Our families would patch us up, and we'd go out and do it all over again. Yeah, sometimes one of us died. That, was the exception. Now it's the norm. Yes, but I still live here. Well, if we could just get the gangs to throw away the goddamn guns. But they're always going to bang, I know that. But why can't they do it without guns? They don't know how. They are not warriors. I need your help. I can't help you. And you know it. The son of a bitch is killing kids! [speaking spanish] You do what you have to. Just think about it. [rhythmic clapping] [gun shot] [knocking] Ya boy? I'm coming. Can we talk? Sure. Come in. Have a seat. I didn't mean to wake you. No worries. It's OK. I remember the last time you and I sat at this table. God. We were both so hung over I thought we were going to die. What's on your mind? Will you help me get Chesare? Yes. But it's my way. - OK. - What can I do to help? What you can do is stay out of the way. If this goes the way I hope, we all get something we want. You have to trust me, Eddie. OK. [spanish] But if any bullshit comes down, I want to know about. OK. [speaking spanish] [spanish] Wait. You forgot this. It's empty. [inaudible] Viva Chesare! That's what a vato loco get some Chesare [spanish] Ruiz, that was very nice. I wish you would treat all the clientele like you treat him. Get out of my face, man. It's not healthy. Is that a fact? Oh no, Mr. Martelli. But I might have a germ or something. And I wouldn't want you to get sick and die, you know? [spanish] Why are you back? I want to learn to be a warrior. Why? I need to learn how to fight. I need to be ready. I told you, get a gun. You don't take a gun against your family. So you want to be a fighter? But why do you want to be a warrior? Warrior, fighter. It's all the same thing. I just want to learn how to fight. Fighter is a fighter. A warrior is something much, much more. Go away. Think about this. Ask yourself if you can look into the eyes of a man you want to kill. When you have answered that question into your heart, come back. I hope the answer takes that smile off your face. [spanish], Chesare. Anything you need, you just ask. Mr. [inaudible] will take care of you great. So have you answered my question? No. Then why did you come back? To learn the answer to your question. To do what I have to do to be a true warrior, like in the old country. Will you please teach me? Si. I will teach you. Gracias. Don't thank me, man. Because it will not be easy. I will try to break you. [speaking spanish] [spanish] is many things. But what is most important is the true warrior, not the killer. He can kill with no protection. It's only to survive. But to protect the lives of his family. If you fight with your hands, [spanish].. If you fight with a gun, it is [spanish].. You are a killer. It's only to survive. [grunting] Pain is the [spanish] best teacher. [spanish]? What's wrong? - I'm just beginning to wonder if I still want to be a Lobo. Oh? No. I don't know why I want to join anymore. All they do is wait to get killed or busted. You don't do anything with meaning. They not going to be your friends? You are more my friend than they could ever be. You teach me. You care about me. No one else ever has. Your mother cares about you. Yeah, I know she does. She always thinks something's going to happen. You-- you trust me. You're my friend. And the Lobos? Are they going to be your friends? I don't think so. [spanish], Paulo. You are now a warrior. [spanish], Paulo. No. No! Paulo! What are you doing? Do you know who this man is? He's my friend. He's not! Paulo, you come with me now. Carmen, it's not what you think. This man, he kill your father! Is that true? Yes. But it was a long time ago. But a warrior. You said-- Paulo! Paulo! [gun shot] What do you want? To talk. I have nothing to say to you. Well, I have something to say to you. [spanish] Paulo. What is it? May I come in? You haven't changed. Neither have you. Yes, I have in many ways. But right now, I need you to know what's going on. I know what's going on. You are going to get my last son killed. You teach him how to fight. You make it easy for him to join [spanish].. He would have joined anyway. Carmen, please. Listen to me. I'm trying to change things. [spanish] is trying to change things. Ha! You still blame me for [inaudible].. You killed him. You lost a husband. And I lost my wife. It was a challenge. [inaudible] chose the weapon, and he tried to kill me. I simply reacted. I will live with that night for the rest of my life, Carmen. I live with it too. And with the deaths of my two sons. Now you teach Paulo to simply react. I hate it. I hate all of it. The drug, the guns, the fighting, the killing. Well, what do you want, Carmen? A son who knows how to fight with his hands or a son who knows how to use a gun? Paulo is quick. He's a natural leader. He may be the one to change things. If he lives that long. I need your help. Please. We have to try to stop this, this-- Insanity. [bell tolls] [music playing] CHESARE: Excellent, man. Excellent. OK. And me shipment is going be on time? Bueno. Mucho gracias, amigo. OK. Bye. Bye bye. [playing piano] Now, it's been brought to my attention that you Red Wings have been holding back on me. That's bullshit. Says who? - The bapas. - Huh. The bapa says this? The bapas. Yeah? Well, fuck them, OK? Them fucking bastards, man, they lie to their own mothers. Well, perhaps. But you see, their mother wouldn't kill them for lying. I would. Chesare, man. You got it all wrong, man. They set me up. A set up? Yeah. Can't you see that? Listen. Y'all been coming up short! If the bapas says the Red Wings, I believe them. They're lying man. You got to believe me, man. They're lying. I don't think so. Aw, come on. What? You got a bunch of faggots in here, huh? Want some, huh? Big man? You want some? Huh? Huh? Come on, man. Come on. [playing piano] [interposing voices] Paulo, ese! Where you been? Around. OK. We're going to kick some fucking ass [inaudible].. [cheering] Right. Hey, What, aye? [inaudible] jumped in. [inaudible] Wow. You sure man? You want it here? You know what it means. It's forever, man. Unless you get jumped out. Yeah, man. I know. OK, man. Hector? [spanish] [speaking spanish] OK, school boy. Now you throw with me, ese. Come on, fucking punk. Get up. Come on! Hector! Let's see what you do against [speaking spanish] Hector, [spanish]! [spanish] little mother fucker. I could have kicked his fucking ass all over the hood, man. But he needs some old fucking gangster to help him. [speaking spanish] The big East LA Lobo gang. [speaking spanish] Boom. Boom. Boom. How about this, man. Later. Later. [gun shots] Big East LA Lobo gang rules the fucking barrio forever, you fucking [spanish]. Show us what you can do. Hector just broke the truce. Where's Hector? MIGUEL: Haven't seen him. STONE: Some heavy shit went down tonight, Miguel. Two of my men are dead. Hector did it. You guys broke truce, man. Hector broke the truce. The Lobos had nothing to do with it. Bullshit, holmes! Hector's warlord of the Lobos. If it weren't for the truce, I'd smoke your whole fucking sect right now. But I don't want to piss off Chesare. So what are we going to do about this matter? Before the games, holmes. And I want proof. This is business. Chesare may get pissed, and make the Lobos an extinct species. And if he don't, I will. Aurelio! Aurelio, [speaking spanish] Aurelio! Aurelio! Hector broke the truce, man! Miguel went after him. Something's going to happen. Something's going down, man! [speaking spanish] Miguel, [speaking spanish] You broke the truce, man. [speaking spanish] Fuck the truce, ese. The boppers paid, man. Chapo Loco made them pay, holmes. Nobody fucks with the Big East LA Lobo gang, brother. Yo, man. You fucked up big time. No, Miguel. [speaking spanish] Those fuckers never knew it happened, man. I just went up to them, and boom, ese. You stupid motherfucker. Don't you get it, ese? You blew it! You stupid chickenshit! You ain't no vato [spanish]. You're just as bad as they are. You got whipped, so you had to go prove you had balls. So you break the fucking truce, and maybe bring Chesare down on all of us. Fuck you, ese! I made them pay alone! I went up to them, and boom, man! You shot them in the back! So what, man? You think you bad? You do me, man. Fuck me in the fucking eye, and pull the trigger. Then you can be pres and you can whatever you want. Come on, man! Do it! Don't be chickenshit. You're jumped out, man. I don't care what the Boppers do to you. [screaming] [gun shot] [sirens] Let's go over it again. Look, what do you want me to tell you, Rodriguez? I told you everything I know. Did Miguel kill Hector? I don't know. Why did Hector break the truce? Man, no say! Well, then who knows? Miguel and Hector. Right. You wait for me outside. [spanish] Aurelio, what the hell happened? You asking me to trust you. All of a sudden, I've got two dead Boppers and two dead Lobo's on my hands in the middle of a truce. And forensic is telling me these two shot each other. Now, what the fuck is going on? Are you asking me as a cop? Yeah, I'm asking you as a cop. I don't know, man. Don't bullshit me! I don't talk to cops. What the hell are you look at? Get back to work! Off the record? Hector killed the two boppers. He had to pay for the killings. So how did we get two dead Lobos. No say, amigo. Paulo and I got here too late. Need something else? No. You and the kid can split. I'll be in touch. Williams? Are we almost wrapped up here? [camera clicking] [chuckling] CHESARE: It is time for the games, young warriors. So you're the number one Lobo, aye? What's your name? AURELIO: [spanish] CHESARE: Little old, aren't ya? AURELIO: We'll see at the games. I nominate Paulo. Yeah. I say we fight for the pres, man. Do you think you could beat Paulo, ese? I nominate Aurelio. Yeah, Aurelio. Look, the rules say that anyone could be pres by fighting for the pres. Miguel is dead, man. [spanish] Hector? Hector is dead too. Aurelio is alive, man. [spanish] He's never been jumped out. He's still a Lobo. I nominate Aurelio. Maybe, just maybe he can keep us alive. Do I hear a second? I nominate Aurelio too. And Paulo as warlord. Yeah, all right. [spanish] [spanish]! I walked away a long time ago. I got tired of this bullshit. If I do this, it's my way. [speaking spanish] The killings have to end. It's never gonna end, ese. That's the way it is for you. And that's the way it is for us! Los Lobos have to kill to survive. We don't have to kill. Killing is a fucking waste. Fight if you must. But mano a mano. This is the way the Lobos are going to do it from now on. Mano a mano? If we do it that way, we're all going to be dead in six months. [spanish] Why, ese? Because we're not fucking Superman. Bullets don't bounce off us. If we don't kill them, they don't kill us. No [spanish] wants to die. The Lobos got a reputation, ese. We've got to be strong. Otherwise, the other varios think we're [spanish].. Why don't we make the other gangs want to be like us? And how do you want to do that? The games. Rodriguez, I thought you were going to gather evidence on this Chesare, so that we might just maybe shut these goddamn games of his down for good. But so far, all I've seen is a lot of nothing. Ending with a couple of dead Lobo's, who allegedly shot each other. Now, what in the hell is going on? A bunch of shit came down. Things got screwed up. But I've still got a solid line on the games. It's just that at this point I've got to take this slow. I line? What? Who is it? Can't reveal that. Captain, you know that if I don't protect my sources I lose them. Well, just what in the hell am I supposed to tell the Mayor's office? Tell them the truth! I'm working on it! Captain, my source is solid. I need more time. No. See, time is what we don't have any of. Because if we don't find those games this year, we may all be looking for a job. Do you understand me? Yes, sir. Good. What's on your mind? I was just kind of wondering when my father was like. Mother never says anything about him, you know? My brother, Carlos, well, he never said much either. You want the truth? Yeah. Your father was not a good man, Paulo. He was greedy and dangerous. He and Chesare set me up to be challenged. At the end, Chesare tried to shoot me. And Loretta took the bullet meant for me. So you lost a father, and I lost my wife. Gangs are a lot like wars. They're really good for nothing, except for getting people killed. Maybe, just maybe we can change that at the games. [chanting] Warriors! We have gathered to the games. The games! And who do you fight for? [chanting] Chesare. Chesare. Chesare. Chesare. Chesare. Chesare! Chesare! Chesare! Chesare! And how do you fight? To the death! To the death! To death! The Lobos do not answer? Are they afraid? The Lobos are not afraid, Chesare. Who speaks for the Lobos? [spanish], Chesare. Aurelios. Me old adversary. I thought you went back to the old country. The Lobos are chickenshit! [imitating chickens] I say it's Chesare who is el pollo. You're fucking chickenshit. Why else would he have his army fight to the death? Why? Because he is afraid you will one day unite and destroy him! You! Are my powers. You keep the games alive. Only the best survive. Only the luckiest! Doesn't take skill to grab a gun and shoot your opponent. It's simply who reaches the gun first, not who the better man is. I want to see real warriors. If you are not afraid of them, Chesare, then let them fight to first blood. Bull shit! It's always been a fight to the death. The boppers are not afraid of any one of you. No one can take on a bopper one-to-one. Boppers! Boppers! Boppers! What's the matter, Stone? You afraid to look your opponent in the eye when you fight? Or maybe the boppers have been winning the games so many times, because Chesare wants them to. [chanting] First blood. First blood. First blood. First blood. First blood. First blood. First blood. First blood. First blood! First blood! First blood! First blood! So be it. First blood. That means that one of the two combatants can no longer fight. No guns. No gloves. No rules. Just the last man to walk out of the ring under his own power. First blood will be decided, as always, by the draw. Let the games begin! [bell dings] [cheering] Yeah [bell dings] [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] [bell dings] Paulo! No! [spanish] ! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Santiz? [coughing] Bad dude, man. Bad dude. [spanish] ! [crowd cheering] [bell dings] Aurelio? It is not over. We still got one more fight. Years ago, this day would come. Si, I suppose. Now, Aurelio! [crowd cheering] In front of all my soldiers. To the death. [bell dings] Aurelio, fight! RODRIGUEZ: Chesare! [gun shot] He called it. To the death! He had no honor. No courage to face a real warrior. The games are over! You can all go back to fighting your petty little turf wars. Killing each other for a few blocks of the caged city, you'd be doing exactly what we want you to do. It would mean that many less of you that we have to deal with. Or maybe, just maybe some of you might learn something from that man standing in the ring. You'll learn what it really means to be a real warrior. Maybe then the killing will stop. Maybe then the war will end. [chanting] Aurelios. Aurelios. Aurelios. Aurelios. Aurelios. Aurelios.
