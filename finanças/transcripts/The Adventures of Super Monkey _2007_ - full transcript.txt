Once when I was a child I met four sages on the road Walking toward the horizon They were an odd sight Even to this day when westerly winds blow I am reminded of them I'm sick of all this sand! When will we get there? I'm not going any further! Not another step! And I'm all out of water! You said it. I'm parched. Shut up and keep moving! I'll bet your head "plate" is dry, too! What? Never make fun of a river imp's plate, Pigsy. - I didn't! - I knew it was you! - You're asking for it! - Come on, then! Fine! Stop it! Our journey is not simply to reach India, you know. Observe that bird. Its graceful flight is the product of tireless effort. Our quest to retrieve the sutras will require nothing less. Bird meat! Capture it! Monkey! Sandy! Pigsy! Wait! Where'd he go? Save your energy! My meal has flown off! Look! What the heck? A king's burial mound? Monkey, no! Food offerings! You'll incur Buddha's wrath. Possibly steamed buns! - Steamed buns? - Steamed buns! No! Stop! - Buns! Buns! - Give me a ride on your shoulders. Someone's coming. You don't think... Buddha's wrath. That was quick. Run! What's with them? Water. You! Hand over that water! Monkey! Forgive us. We are but pilgrims on route to India. We meant no disrespect to this sacred grave. So give us food and water. Please. Hey, wait! Just some water! Whoa, horsy! You're letting them go! - So where's the wrath? - Ask him? Perhaps I was mistaken. - They had water. - Possibly food, too. Bring back those horses! - Hor...! - Hor...? Horse! Stop! Stop! Where is he? There! - OK, move quietly, got it? - OK. Nice horsy! Give us water! Just a sip! Monkey! Pigsy! Sandy! - Master! - You'll scare him off. There! Behold! It can't be. Civilization! MONKEY MAGIC Lt was a time when dragons still inhabited the skies. A priest named Tripitaka journeyed west in search of magical sutras that could restore peace to the land. Traveling with him were three mythical creatures - Monkey, Sandy and Pigsy. Their destination? A great temple in India. But awaiting the priest and his intrepid entourage... - "Fu-chien". - "Tiger People"? They sound fearsome. I smell danger. We best be careful. Food! Where's the food? Fly! Food! My horn is cracked. No wonder. Who're you? I'm Tripitaka. I'm Sandy. Pigsy. Meow! Hear ye, hear ye! I am the great... King Monkey! You're idiots. Want to fight about it? Go show 'em. Do it. - Idiot! - Never mind. Run away! Excuse us, please. She smells nice. - Sweet. - Fruity. Look, more impostors! Like heck! We're the real thing! Look! "Save us Tripitaka"? That's me. This kingdom is looking to hire us. That explains those frauds. Charlatans! What? Why you...! I'm stuck! Hey, give that back! You shouldn't have done that! Knock it off, Porko! Sorry. I'm free! Now I'm mad. Look what you made me do! Stop it! Monkey! Stop it! He's gone bonkers. You've no choice. But... You're right. Ow, ow, ow! You again! I've seen enough. A horse. If you're hungry, drop by my place. Where's that? Wait! Girlie! Hey! Could this be the place? This ain't no home. It's another trick. Some home. Bit depressing, eh? So where's the food? Cut it out, Monkey. "To a land darkened by plague he came "bearing three bells. "His prayers, like swords, split open the clouds "and brought forth light." This legendary figure went by the name of Tripitaka. Hear that, Master? You're a legend. - It's a mistake. - Yeah, but maybe they'll feed us. I'm no "legendary figure". Yes, I present you... the legendary Tripitaka! Monkey! Then we beg your assistance. A curse has turned our king and queen into tortoises. An incantation by the real Tripitaka would restore them. You can do that? Of course not. Chanting isn't sorcery. - Food! Food! - Please hurry. - Good luck, Master! I can't do this. Another impostor, I see. But you said you'd feed us. - We're not impostors. - You said you'd feed us! Hold it! Princess Reimi. I wish to speak to them. - But... - Leave us! Yes. Bad day? You made me break my horn! Feed us! I'll fix the curse for food. - Yes, Pigsy! - Go for it! Don't be stupid. Chants can't lift curses. But killing demons can. Demons? You're the real Tripitaka Party, right? Fighting demons is your specialty. You are mistaken. Until recently, ours was a land rich in water and greenery. And then... "they" came. "They"? The land withered under their feet. With each breath they took, the water evaporated. In a single day, our kingdom was turned to desert. They laid a curse on my parents and usurped the throne. Their names? King Gold Horn and his brother, King Silver Horn. "King Gold Horn"? "King Silver Horn"? I've heard of them. Even Hanzui the Chaos Lord fears their absolute power. Absolute? You're kidding! No one in my kingdom dares to confront them. We used to be called the "Tiger People". Now we're reduced to frightened kittens. How awful. They reside on Mount Garyo. If you hurry... - Look at the time. - Got to go. - Nature calls. - You're in trouble. - Will you help? - Yes. No! Please save our kingdom! - Yes. - No! - Thank you. - Master! - Let us depart. - No-o-o-o! Can't we at least wait till morning? I'm their princess. They wouldn't allow me to go if they knew. Why should we have to face such danger? Fine. I'll go alone. When they see I'm gone, they'll surely blame you. It'll be the guillotine. - The guillotine? - The guillotine? I like my head. I want to keep it. Pipe down! What is it? I got dust in my eye. Oh no! Shall we turn back, then? Watch that sarcasm. I happen to be a princess, you know. Well, excuse me but who was it that begged us to come? That was then. This is now. Quite a spoiled princess. We're no match against demons of absolute power. Really? No match? Banish the thought! We're certainly not "no match"! If you defeat Gold and Silver Horn, you'll be the one with "absolute power". Victory is mine! Let's go! How simple can one be? To victory! Go, go! Onward! To victory! Demons, your end is near! - Are you guys rowing? - Yes! Just shut up and row! Is there something evil in this river? Probably. Don't say that. We're sitting ducks! Don't rock the boat! Sorry. Yes, be careful. You're escorting a princess, remember? Sorry. Why's she so bossy? I said don't rock the boat! I'm not! Then who is? We travel on foot from here. Look, the mountain where Gold and Silver Horn reside. Who's brave enough to lead us? That would be me! Can you see the top? The Horn brothers climb this with great ease. Oh no, I looked. Can't do that. My clothes are snagging. Don't go so fast. My tassels are snagging! One misstep and we're dead. Careful! You're such an idiot. Don't yell. I'm sorry, OK? What's this? Obviously a trap. What are we? Morons? Who'd fall for that? Not us. Bananas! My favourite! He would. I can't believe you fell for it. Stupid monkey. Well, I've had it. I'm pooped. Let's go home. After just this? You guys are pathetic. Go by yourself, then. Princess Reimi? What? You've injured your foot. It's just a blister. You're short of breath. It's nothing. Talk about pathetic! You talk a good game but you're just a pampered princess. Why don't you run on home? No way! I'm going ahead. But why? Yeah, you're a princess. You belong in the palace. I'm not afraid to die. For something important, I'd gladly give my life. So if I do perish, promise me you'll defeat those two. We promise to deliver you safely home to your palace. Yes, and save your family. We won't lose. We'll all make it back alive. Promise? Promise. Thank you. Let's move! For now, you need to rest your feet. I know I do. Crazy monkey. Isn't there anything of value in here? It's them! Let's rest here. Sit here, Master. You're very kind. Master? - Are you all right? - What's wrong, Master? Lose your seat? What the...! What's that? Look out! That was close! Another booby trap? - Ls it returning? - Nah. It is. Hurry! Faster! Faster! This way! No, this way! It's a dead end! Here it comes! - We're dead. - This says "stop". It's a trap! We've no choice! You're a fool! - But... - You'll kill us! - I'm pushing it! - No! See? Nothing. We're dead. It's your fault. Darn you! It's your fault! We're saved. What now? Thank you. Hey, do you mind? Wow! Monkey! Run! Look at that arc! Master! I'm not done peeing yet! I'm wetting myself! Master! Quick! I'm stuck! Monkey! No! I don't need your help, all right? You promised... that we'd all survive. Remember? Hold it! Thank you. Master! Monkey! What's that? - A mushroom. - Lt looks familiar. - Dig it out. - OK. Hey. Where am I? Sandy! Pigsy! An entrance. Then let's enter. What is this place? Where are we? - What a nap! - Hibernating? What're you two doing here, anyway? Looking for Kings Gold and Silver Horn. Gold and Silver Horn? They're not here! Rin-Rin! I guess I made it. How I missed you... Come again? Gold and Silver Horn aren't here. You're kidding? This is just one of your usual thievery schemes. I admit I'm a thief. But it's that princess who is scheming. What're you doing? Yield the morning, O Golden Sun. Deceive the night, O Limpid Moon. Come faithful servant of tiger and dragon. Issue your mighty river of light. Shall we go? What was that chant? Monkey, hurry. Gold and Silver Horn, here I come! Wait! Sandy! Pigsy! Why's she here? We made it just in time, Master. It's all a trap. Gold and Silver Horn are back at the palace. The palace? You're full of it! Come on! I saw them! It was them. I'm sure of it. If they're at the palace, why'd you bring us here? To find a secret potion that can restore my father and mother. - Really? - Wait! What potion is that? - Um... - Can't remember? We're wasting time! Since this is all a lie, I say we return to town. We're sick of being duped. Pigsy! I'm sure you have your reasons for this. But perhaps we should return and regroup. No! I haven't come this far to stop now! Don't let her trick you with her tears. You, shush! What're you going to do? None of this has anything to do with you! So stop butting in! Who called you here? Leave! Go home! Fine! I was just trying to help. You big jerk! And don't come back! - Monkey! - Let's go! Haven't you been listening? - We've been tricked. - So what? - So you're an idiot! - Monkey! I made a promise! I made a promise to her. That's why I'm going. - Hold it! - Monkey! Move! - That's it! - You idiot! Stop it, Monkey! Now see here! No, you mustn't go! Believe me... I know how you feel. But... I said I'm going! Our destination is India. This is an unnecessary risk. Where's the Tripitaka I know? The real Tripitaka wouldn't break a promise! - But I... - I quit! You are no longer my master. Wait! Monkey! Master, look out! Monkey! We made it. Sure is quiet. No food stalls? We've got to find some grub. Master, what's wrong? It's Monkey, isn't it? Forget that foolish monkey. Monkey was right. In my obsession to reach India... I've forgotten my true mission as a priest. Monkey was talking nonsense! I mustn't leave him to face danger alone. Understood. We'll find him for you. - I'll... - You wait here, Master. We promise to bring him back. Just to be safe, stay clear of the palace. Sandy? Be careful. Look out! Take cover! Buzz off! What is this? Demon magic? That's cold! What's the big idea? It's snow. Snow? You've never seen snow? Snow, huh? What's that, then? What's what? Ow. Snow is fun! Hey! Snow! Snow! Cold! Cold! Not bad. Dig in! It's not food! There, huh? That's the place? Monkey? Thanks for believing me. No thanks needed. But... We're "puddies". "Puddies"? Yeah, "puddies" look out for each other. Let's go! No one's home. The potion? Yeah. That hurt. What're you doing? Feeling a draft. What's all the racket? Who's there? Grandpa? Reimi. "Grandpa"? What is it? Eat up. I bet it's another trick. Sorry. Just plain porridge. It's about time. Thanks. - Yum. Say, Pops? - Yes, monkey? Your magic potion. Fork it over. So where is it? - I've an itch. - Don't throw it at me! Hey! Boy, am I full! Listen, tenderfoot. Behave yourself. OK, already. I promise to behave... later. Monkeys never learn from their mistakes. Silly monkey. Silly monkey. Monkey! Lots of guests today. Greetings. Why'd you come? To fetch you. Master's worried. He's not my master. I quit, remember? You're heartless! You're bellybutton-less. Don't get insulting. Easy, easy! Aren't we pals? I'm not "puddies" with a pig. Some nerve! After all we've done for you! Have you forgotten your debt to Tripitaka? He freed you from a rock after 500 years! I've paid him back plenty! I hung with you guys, fought off demons... That's not enough! Monkey... we owe our Master a gratitude that can't be repaid. He has given us... hearts. That can't be measured in distance. Nor in the number of demons killed. A heart can only be repaid with another heart. Is there a problem? Forgive us. We have no choice. You are... Listen, Gramps. What? I'm taking Reimi back to the palace. Hand over the potion now! This isn't a potion. It's an orb. An "orb"? You came for this, didn't you, Reimi? On orders of Gold and Silver Horn. Yes. That's correct. Now give it to me. What's this all about? Why do they want the orb? They despise sunlight. They want to plunge the world into darkness. Darkness? Sealed under the palace by my ancestors lies a beast... capable of issuing a dark cloud. Gold and Silver Horn need the orb to revive it. But then... The Sun will be blotted out. Vegetation will wither. All life will perish. And you plan to hand them the orb? I've no choice. So you used us. I have to save my mother and father! Gold Horn. Silver Horn. Well, well, if it isn't the great Tripitaka. My, my. Going somewhere? Ah, yes. Master Tripitaka? What? Come, come. Resist if you will. In here. Come. Don't you care what happens to them? You must let go. It's painful, yes. But you are the princess of this kingdom. "Tiger People", indeed. Nobody lifted a finger to help my parents. They were all too afraid! No one dared confront Gold and Silver Horn. My people aren't worth saving. They can all die for all I care! Reimi! Poor Reimi. Oh, no. Silver Horn! I've been waiting for you! Staff! Release her! Hold still. Reimi. Ah, the fabled orb. Nice work, Princess. Now restore my parents. You promised! Did I? Black Wind! Monkey! The orb! Flying Cloud! Watch it! Here I come, Silver Horn! Yoo-hoo! Give me that! Get back here! What an imbecile. I'll take that! No, you don't. Hands off! Look out! - Left! Left! - Left. - Right! - Right. - Left again! - Left. Where'd you learn to fly? Here we go. One more. My leg! Darn you! Why you...! Drat! Darn you! How much longer? We're lost! You're pathetic! Ow, ow, ow! What? This? It's mine! You idiot! Sorry! He's getting away. Loser! Staff! Where is it? Stupid monkey... See this? I'll make a trade. This for that ball. You're not too bright, are you? - Who would trade for that? - I guess I can burn it, then. With that little... priest inside. Master! Monkey! Give me that! Master! Burn baby burn! Now give me the ball. Master! Master... it's hot! Monkey, move! Fire brigade! Master! Let me see. He looks OK. How do you get in there? Tell me! Just answer when your name is called. Gotcha! Say my name. You sure? Yes, hurry! Go! King Monkey! Yes! Master! Wake up! Open your eyes! Master! Master... Master! Forgive me. Forgive me! I'm sorry, Master. Monkey? Master! You're safe. I'm so glad. Yeah, I'm OK. And so are you. So are you! You came to save me. Well, of course! I'm your number one disciple. Yes. All right! Let's get out of here! Yes. Don't tell me... How do we get out? You came in without a plan? I didn't have time. Hey, geezer! Girl thief! Monkey! What? Careful, you klutz! Lower a rope or something in here! A rope? - From where? - A rope? Found one. Where? Here it comes! Lower! Lower! Hurry! OK! Good! Grab on, Master. This reeks. Ouch! It hurts! Pull us up, old man! I'm trying, you dumb ape! Rin-Rin! Ow. You OK, Master? Monkey! Tripitaka! My beard! You fool! Don't look. Don't look! Pooh! Master! Sandy! Pigsy! Are we glad to see you! You're safe. Yes. - I should've left you in there. - Shut up! Gramps! We have to stop Reimi. She's gone to face the Horn brothers alone. Master! My brother! Oh, no. - Move aside. - Proceed no further! We're ruled by Gold and Silver Horn. - Tough! - You can live with that? Cowards! Quiet! If you value your life. Hail the Horn Kings! Banish the rebels! Fine, but you'll be sorry. Stop! Master, stand back! - Leave! - Master! Don't fight them. Let us pass. I'll kill you. You don't understand. We have no choice. We must obey or die. Then you are already dead. Inaction is the same as death. Having breath is not the same as having life. Nor is life limited to a beating heart. To live... is to struggle. What do you know of struggle? You're a priest! A father's struggle to till the land and feed his family. A mother's struggle to give birth to a child. The struggle of children to please their parents. But we cannot defeat Gold and Silver Horn. Defeat does not mean losing. Running away is losing. Failing to confront your fear is losing. We must fight if we want to live. Just words! Let them pass! King Ryusei! Let them pass. No! This is no longer your kingdom! That kingdom is gone! What did they call us? Cats? Pigeons? Dogs with wagging tails? No. We're "Tiger People"! Tigers answer to no one! Tigers don't give up! We are tiger people, tall and proud. We are direct descendants of fearless people. Am I not right, Captain? Here they come. Leave them to us! Hurry! Charge! Stand your ground! Soon this world will be cloaked in darkness. And it will be ours. Return the orb. Have you lost your senses? Stand down. Don't you care what happens to your sovereigns? Put down your weapon. Not another step! I was mistaken. I'm supposed to defend my country. At the cost of your family? They would understand. My father... and my mother. They'd understand! Beg for mercy. Your courage... is irritating. Die! Who goes there? I should've guessed. Monkey. Sorry we're late. Gold and Silver Horn! How dare you insult the princess! The people have rebelled! Nobody fears you any longer. What? Why do you fight for me? - I'm ashamed. - Have you forgotten, silly princess? We made a promise! And I swear to honor it. Otherwise, it isn't a promise, is it? Enough of your gibberish! You'll all be dead soon. - Quick! Save your parents! - OK. Halt! - I'll be right back. - Princess! Tripitaka! Here! Missed! Damn you! Watch it! Come on! Show yourself! Come out and fight like a beast! You pig! Some help that is! Sorry. Where'd he go? Gotcha! Look here! Our prisoner! My brother. Princess Reimi! Master! - Monkey! - Stop! Please, Monkey... save my people. Gold Horn! King Monkey... would you be my little brother? What a waste to let humans rule this world. Together... this world could be ours. You're insane. Humans are weak. They huddle in masses... harbor false hopes. Enslaved by their emotions... they whimper in their fear. Such weaklings aren't worthy of this world. They're powerless creatures. Lower than maggots! You're wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! I grant you humans are small and weak. They moan at dust in their eyes. Get blisters on their feet. Have weak, spindly limbs. They're vain and arrogant. But despite all that... they have one incredible skill. They can join together. And be best "puddies". That creates courage. Individually, they're weak. But together... they can move mountains! When you're lost, their voices can find you. The bravest in this world... are those with friends! As long as you have friends, you can't be beaten! God or Buddha may put up with someone like you! But I won't! So it's your choice! Will it be heaven or hell? Hell is where you're going! Listen up! Behold the Monkey...! Monkey! Hold your celebrations! Look! What'll we do? My Flying Cloud! You'll be pulverized! For sure! We'll see about that! Fly! Monkey! Use this! Trap the dragon in it. Great idea! Hurry! - Monkey! - What're you doing? Hurry! Does anyone know... its name? Oh, come on! Let me help. Reimi! You know its name? I'm the princess, aren't I? Don't be so vain. OK. Damoron! It's working! Monkey! Don't let go! I can't hold on any longer! - Don't be a wimp! - I'll try! Pigsy! Don't let go! The lid! The lid! Got it! We did it. The pain, Master. The pain. I can't stand it. The pain... I'm finished. Monkey. Listen up! Behold the Monkey King! "He came from the east, bearing three bells. "His prayers, like swords "split open the clouds and brought forth light. You are the legendary heroes after all. - Oh well... - He's not speaking of you. He's talking about Master. What's with the fancy threads? - Bow down. - You insult the princess! No, no. Lt is you to whom we should bow. Now I can live in peace. Will you return to the hills? That suits me best. Whatever you say, Father. Tripitaka... Monkey, Sandy and Pigsy... thank you. Ah, it was nothing. We must reward you. We have already received our reward. Right, Monkey? Sandy? Pigsy? Right. The smile... on all your faces. "Farewell." Till we meet again. King Monkey! "Your smile is our reward"? Smiles won't fill my stomach. Let's spend the night here. No, we still have a long way to go. Monkey! - Thank you for saving us. - You were so cool! Monkey's the strongest! Follow me Master, Sandy, Pigsy. To India! See ya. - What a ham. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Tiger People. What a simpleton! Fu-chien I'm through! I can't walk another step! I won't budge! - Monkey! - Hurry it up! Come on! I hate you! You're a bunch of nags!
