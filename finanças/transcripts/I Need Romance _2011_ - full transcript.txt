Subtitles by DramaFever [Episode 1] [The Woman who Resembled Shing-Shing.] The day that I was born... was the first snowfall of the year. The seven year old Shing-Shing walked through the pristine white snow untainted by others footprints and made her way through the snow to meet me. I heard everything from Shing-Shing. I was told that I resembled a sweet potato when I was first born. I don't believe what I'm told. He's going to have one tough life being so ugly like that. I grew up in Shing-Shing's home. I'm told that I looked like a roasted sweet potato when I turned a year old. Which means that I got even uglier. That's why Shing-Shing... was said to have covered up my face at every chance she had. Whenever I hear the old Korean saying that a habit at a year old will become a habit at 80 years old... I feel like they're talking about me. This is my first time back in Korea in 17 years. The Shing-Shing that I remember is smart... innocent... and kind. I wonder what Shing-Shing is like now? My goodness. In the alley? - For an entire hour? - Stop laughing! - That's not even that funny. - Tell us the truth. - You really just kissed, and that's it? - Whatever. At first, I was going to say goodbye after just a quick kiss. But he just kept going, and things got steamier. I was going to stop after a while myself. But I couldn't help myself... and we moved over to the next alley. Your boyfriend really is earnest about everything he does. He'll easily pass his civil exam with that kind of dedication. I was worried about what he was doing when he had his big exam the next morning. But what else could we do? My body was starting to burn, and I couldn't stop myself either. Why didn't you guys just go to a motel instead? That's what I'm saying. We don't have the money for that. If we went to a motel every time we wanted to go then we'd be spending half our salaries on paying for the motels. We promised each other that we'd only go once a month to a motel. It's just safer to plan it that way. My goodness. We just kept doing that for an entire hour. Let's use our team dinner outing money and fund their motel room. I agree with that idea. Consider it an employee welfare case. I'll make sure not to let those funds go to waste. - But we're going to need a full report. - And make sure to turn in your receipts. What are you all talking and smiling about? What is it that you're going to do with team dinner outing money? - We want to donate it to the needy. - We want to donate it to the needy. That sounds good. I'm in complete agreement with that idea. Hi mom. Sweet potato? He's back in Korea? How old is he now? What's he back here for? Music? Ugh... I bet he grew up to be a total delinquent. What took you so long to get here? You made me wait at the airport for the last 40 minutes. You'll be staying at a hotel in the city. We're looking into some rental houses, so it'll just be for the time being. Give me the car keys. What do you want the keys for? Don't call me if you can help it. I won't answer even if you do call. You can just text me my schedule, and don't be on my case if I don't respond right away. If you annoy me with incessant phone calls, I'm going to change my number. Just leave me be unless you really need me for something. - I work better that way. - But, Allen... - You have the photo shoot this afternoon... - I'll get myself there myself. - Did you get all the materials that we need? - That's what I'm doing right now. My mom said that she imposed on them during her most recent trip to America so she wants me to let their son stay at my house while he's here. And for a whole year at that. That must complicate things. With Lee Jung Ho. That's right! I had forgotten about that. Okay, send me Sweet Potato's number. I'll go meet up with him. I told you that I'll take care of it. Okay. I don't know why I didn't think of that myself. Okay. This can't be Han River, can it? I wonder if that's only said up in the mountains. Anyways. It's good to see you, Republic of Korea! I promised Shing-Shing that I'd come back. And I did come back. To Shing-Shing's world. [Call me.] [It's me, Shing-Shing.] Where are you? Why are you talking in casual speech with me right off the bat? I've spoken to you in casual speech since the day you were born. But aren't we still only strangers to one another at this point? Do you remember what I look like? No, I don't remember. Except for the fact that you were ugly. Well, I'm sure you must've grown quite a bit. So tell me where you are right now. I'm playing with the seagulls right now. Where do you think I'm at? Do you remember? On that snowy day... when we went to see the giraffes? What the heck? You. I'm busy right now, so I'm going to get straight to the point. I still haven't decided whether I'm going to let you live with me or not. My mom is the one who said that my house is your house. But I don't like that idea. Why don't you like that idea? I'm dating someone. He sleeps over at my place from time to time. You think that he and I just hold hands, and do nothing else when we go to bed? What does it matter if there are two bedrooms? Must I endure having a little boy like you listening to me pant and scream at night? I tend to be a bit on the loud side. I'm much worse than this in real life. I doubt that you want to hear me scream and pant like that every single night, do you? I think it would make me extremely uncomfortable to have you living in my house. I'm sure that my boyfriend would hate that too. So what I'm saying is take the hint and have enough courtesy not to come stay with me at my house. I really hate, loathe, and scathe at the idea of you coming to live with me at my house. Why... do you not like me? First. I don't like you because you're ugly. Second. Your rich parents used to pay my mom to take care of you back in the day as a job. The money she made from watching you is how we were able to get by. Seeing you reminds me of those days. I really hate the thought of that. I hate it so much that it gives me the creeps. - The creeps? - You get how much I hate the idea, right? I hope that we'll never have to talk to each other like this again. Wait. I've... missed you. I've missed you, Shing-Shing. Jung Hee Jae, the color of the day is mint. Tell them this is wrong. Take a look at this. This is all wrong. You need to get this corrected. Got it? - Get in touch with all our business partners. - Okay. Everyone on camera, the color of the day is mint. Make sure you get a good shot of the products. Five minutes until we're on air. Everyone be ready. Let's go! Why aren't the call numbers going up? It'll get there. Just wait. There it goes! Over 700 calls already! Awesome. Over 700 calls already. Over 700 callers. This is awesome! We're all sold out of the grey and the mocha color. Every size in every color is now sold out. Shin Joo Yeon is going to have another sold-out show. Amazing. - Want to go out for a beer to celebrate? - I like that idea. Next broadcast show isn't ready yet, so we have to keep going for another 10 minutes. Wipe that smile off your face. And pull the corners of your mouth back down. Okay, team meeting. We have to start strategizing for the next season. You think it's going to give us any advantage to let everyone know how happy we are? - But still... - We're going to have to work even harder now. Compile a report of the customers' responses, and see what it is they're wanting next. Main objective is not have them raise a single penny on us, right? Of course. Of course, she says. I'll be right back. Tae Yoon! Yes! You saw the broadcast, didn't you? Can you believe it? It's another huge hit! That's five in a row now! I can't believe how gifted I am! Every item of every color and size is all sold-out! Must you come to my office to brag and gloat like that? Where else would I go to brag? Everyone else is dying of jealousy right now. Then do you think that I'm genuinely happy for you? Who was it that trained and taught me to be where I am today? You must be so proud, Tae Yoon. To have taught such a successful junior like myself. Yes, congratulations, Shin Joo Yeon on your fifth amazing season in a row. You'd better be careful of your position. I'm going to make my way up to your position soon, Tae Yoon. I like that challenge. There you go acting like a brat again. Why don't you just go out to the steps? I saw Lee Jung Ho head out there earlier as soon as the broadcast ended. That's right. How do I look right now? - Not pretty in the least. - I know that I'm pretty. Honey! We're such a perfect team! I'm so happy right now! Why aren't you kissing me? I'd really love it if you'd kiss me right now. Your kisses... really are the best. - Let's go out to dinner. - Hm? There's something I have to tell you. What is it? I saw PD Lee at a jewelry store in Cheongdamdong yesterday. Really? I was running an errand for my mom because she asked me to go pick up something for her and that's when I saw PD Lee. It was a necklace called, 'Two-Ring'. Two-Ring necklace? Maybe he's planning on proposing. Marriages don't end in happy endings. It's a one way ticket to hell. Why don't you give it a try first? It's not because I can't, but it's because I won't. Oh my goodness. Look at how much this thing costs. This is the one, right? - Let me see. - Oh my goodness. This is so crazy! How can he know my taste so perfectly? - It's 262,000 won. - Oh my God. I know he got a bonus recently and I guess he's about to spend it all on you. You're so lucky! Are you sure that he bought it? He wasn't just window shopping, right? I saw him buying it. But I didn't acknowledge him because he was so focused on buying that necklace. But why is he proposing with a necklace? Shouldn't it be with a ring instead? He already got me a ring when we went to Bali this summer. This ring is made by the same designer as the necklace. - This is so amazing. - That's really pretty. This really fits you perfectly. It's almost as if these clothes were tailor made just for you. - What does it mean if you're creeped out? - That they really hate it. - Why? - Someone told me that I creep them out. What? There's someone out there who would dare talk to the divine Allen Joo like that? - Who's that? - Just someone from my past. - Someone I used to like. - Your first love? The one who taught me about music... was Shing-Shing. Don't you have anything... that you want to say to me? Didn't you say that you had something to tell me? Out on the steps earlier. - Joo Yeon. - Yeah? Let's break up. How does that song make you feel? I feel like I can see a group of yellow chicks running around in the sunshine. A feeling like this, right? Yeah, all the chicks are running around happily together. They're all running around and playing with one another. That's called, joy. - Ah... joy? - Next is, happiness. How do you feel this time? The wind is blowing. The wind feels warm blowing against my skin. I'm all sweaty, but I'm still happy because I like the wind blowing against my skin. The wind makes me feel short of breath, so I have to breathe through my mouth. I can feel the wind in my mouth. That's right. That's what happiness is. Then what does pain feel like? Pain feels like... I'm not sure. Do you remember falling off your bike the other day and hurting your knee? Yeah, and I got hurt here too. That's right. It hurt when you fell, didn't it? That's what pain feels like. That's when you're in physical pain. There are times when your heart hurts like that too. It's very different than being in physical pain... but I'm not quite sure how I can explain the difference. I'm sure you'll find out yourself one day. Where's the heart? Then what about sadness? Excuse me. I'll have the ice cream for my dessert. Two ice creams, please. I just told you that I wanted to break up. Yeah, I heard you. Let's break up after we have the ice cream. Aren't you going to ask me why? Do I really have to know the reason? Knowing your personality, I'm sure you've given it plenty of thought. Whether it's just one single reason, or a hundred different reasons... I have no desire to hang on to a man who says he wants to break up with me. If I tried to hold on to you... would you stay? Do you think that people hold on thinking that the other person will stay? Even while being fully aware that the other person isn't going to stay people still hold on, and cling onto the other person. Whether they stay or not, it's how the person feels that's important... It's not important to me. Hearts and feelings aren't important to me. Sadness... Sadness... is like when two people break up. Your heart is in pain... and the pain deepens even greater then. Something starts to pool in your heart... and that's what sadness is. Why do people break up? Can't they just meet again? Break-ups can happen because two people no longer like each other... and there are a lot of other people who can't be together even though they miss each other. So Shing-Shing is... the woman who molded me into who I am today. The woman... who taught me how to play the piano. The woman who taught me about feelings. There's no reason to be sad, nor be in pain. Relationships coming to an end is a natural occurrence. But... this isn't how I always used to be. How could you do this to me? How could you? Neither you nor Se Ryung are my type. What I really love... is music. Rock. When my first relationship ended... I thought that the sky was going to come crumbling down on me. It was the same way with my second breakup. I can wait. Are you sure about this? I can't keep you chained up just because I love you. - You're too pretty for that. - No, I'm not. I just want to wait for you. I have to go serve in the army once I get back from studying abroad. It's okay. I'm really okay with it. You'd better get inside. You should meet a nice man, date... and get married too. I don't want to have you see me walking away. Go on in. Go on in. No, I'm not going to date or get married! I'm just... I'm just going to wait for you! Because I'm never going to meet anyone else as wonderful as you. Because there's no way that anyone else in this world could be as wonderful as you. It's okay for me to wait for you, right? You don't have to feel burdened! I'm going to wait for you because I want to! Listen to what I have to say before you go! Wait! Wait! - Can you give me some broth too? - Sure. The back that he didn't want me to see... I got to see it. While I was floundering in my sea of sadness and despair... he was... busy filling up on steamed fishcakes. I found out the truth a month later. That what he said about studying abroad... was a bald faced lie. And with that breakup... I realized the true nature of relationships. That love... and break-ups... are nothing but a play of emotions. I guess the price of gold really has gone up. I just sold three of my old couple rings. Even though men may leave, the gold still remains. And the value of gold even went up. Thanks guys. I'll put this money to good use. Oh Se Ryung. I used to think that we were friends. I was afraid that if I gave up on love like this... I would end up becoming like her. I didn't want to become like Oh Se Ryung. Joo Yeon. Joo Yeon! Joo Yeon! What's wrong this time? What have I done wrong now? Is the motel the only place you ever want to take me to? We're going to get pizza anyways so wouldn't it be nice to get it delivered and eat in the comfort of the room? - Let's break up. - Why are you being like this again? - Things are great between us. - What about us is so great? I'm really turned on right now. Let's just get inside. Sleeping with me is the only thing you can think of when you're with me, isn't it? Are you acting like this because there are so many people around? Why don't we go inside and talk about this? Did you just hear what I said? I said, I wanted us to break up! I said, I don't want to! Okay, fine. We can break up. But... since we're here anyways, let's just do it one more time, okay? Let's sleep together just one more time. At that moment... I was reminded of Oh Se Ryung, who I saw selling her rings a few years ago. Let's sleep together just one more time. I'll be good. - How are you going to be good? - I'll do everything. Fine. Since this is our last night together... give it your best shot. So that I can remember you for the rest of my life. After my fifth relationship ended... I no longer ever let myself get too involved no matter what the relationship... and I no longer cried no matter what the breakup. Excuse me, Ma'am. - Your guest didn't pay when he left. - Excuse me? Wait! You really are so strange! Why did you stop me instead of him? You saw what happened, didn't you? Who do you think should pay for this dinner? I'm sorry. Every relationship ends by leaving you with a new realization. I should've walked away first. This place is this expensive? I couldn't understand. There were so many questions that I wanted to ask him. But I didn't ask him any of those questions. There's only one reason for any break-ups. It's because the pinnacle of a relationship... has ended. [First snowfall of the year. Better get home before it starts to pile up.] [Together with Lee Jung Ho PD, who recently ended a relationship] Did you see her new tweet? You'll never believe what happened. Hang on a second. I think Team Leader Shin and PD Lee must've broken up. Unbelievable. Did you see it? What the heck? It wasn't a proposal? What happened to the necklace? Who dumped whom? I heard that it was Team Leader Shin who got dumped. Unbelievable. My Team Leader... just got dumped by her boyfriend. Let's concentrate, Jung Hee Jae. Ignore any work-related text messages when you're out of the office. You don't know because you've never worked at an office before. You're never fully off from work. Leaving the office only means that you're working outside the office. - Who told you that? - My Team Leader. We only come to the motel once a month. Yes, you're right. I sent a message, so I'm all set now. It's been a month since we've chatted. Since the last message I posted on the blog was this past summer it's been about six months since we've last been in touch. You can't say that it's been recent. I'd like to meet you offline one of these days. Since this is the first snowfall of the year... what do you think about meeting tonight? I live in Dae-Chi Dong. Where should we meet? The Design Hotel. It's better you don't even come if you're going to get frightened off now. What the heck? He's more innocent than I had thought he was. The sky lounge bar at that hotel is pretty nice, isn't it? Are you playing right now? We know about each other as much as we need to know. I don't want to bother with dating, and I hate the thought of marriage even more. I like being alone the best, and I don't like anyone bothering me. I also don't want to have any meaningful relationships with anyone either. Isn't that how we both feel? Text me the room number once you've checked in. As for the wine, I think Chateau Margot would be best. [Sweet Potato] What? It's snowing. People are saying that it's the first snowfall of the year. So what? How about we meet up? A day like this is meant to be spent with the person you love. Don't you think? I found out what being creeped out means. Now that you know... don't you think that you should've stopped yourself from calling me again? I think... that you've changed. I've thought about it. I asked myself why you became like this. Even though you told me earlier today that you were in love with someone... that was a lie. If you were in love with someone, and you were being loved by someone... then I'm sure that you would've become someone who cherished memories more. So if you really are seeing someone right now... then it would be best for you to break up with him. Because I'm sure... that's not real love. We're going to end up meeting even if you don't want to meet with me. Because I always keep my promises. I told you that I'd come back to you. See you later, Shing-Shing. I came because I had nowhere else to go. But at this hour? What if I had a girl over? I know perfectly well that you have no girl. Are you getting water? Hey, do you know how much this bottle is? You and your expensive taste. I just got dumped by Lee Jung Ho. Even after we kissed out on the steps earlier this afternoon. He dumped me. What do you think about that? This is what I think about that. Let's drink it. Weren't we thinking of selling that too? You said you couldn't trust that manufacturer because the quality of their products had gone down. I said that? They look pretty good on screen right now, so I don't know why I said that. Thanks. For what? You made me forget all about it. The fact that I just got dumped by a man. What the heck? They're sold-out? Oh my goodness. How can that stuff sell out? I bet they're going to have a ton of returns. Yes, I bet the buyers will realize how poor the quality is once they get their items. Yeah, they should be ashamed of the lack of their quality. - Team Leader Shin is coming. - What kind of a mood is she in? Good morning. - Good morning. - Do you know what I brought with me? Invitations to... Michelle Jang's party to celebrate her 2-year anniversary of the launching of her brand! - Amazing. Just amazing! - I heard the tickets were impossible to get. Let's go make our appearance as a team, and go have some fun. I heard it's a club party. - Really? - You know what the best part is? Allen Joo is going to be the DJ! - That's absolutely amazing! - Who's that? You don't know who Allen Joo is? The genius songwriter, Allen Joo. - Number nine on Japan's Billboard charts. - 'Now and Forever'. You don't know? Thank you. So beautiful. Guys. - Let's go back to dancing. - Let's just take a quick break. I'm exhausted, Min Jung. I think that Allen Joo is staring at us. That's him. He's so handsome. I think that he's staring at you, Joo Yeon. Can't fault him for his good taste. Didn't you just break up with PD Lee last night? You need to take some time to embrace your pain right now. When you go out to buy a new pair of shoes... do you go to the store barefoot? No, you go to the store wearing your old shoes. He's coming this way. Allen. That woman is gorgeous. I guess Oh Se Ryung is pretty hot. No kidding. She really has golden connections. I'm sure it's more like bed connections, rather than golden connections. What are you talking about? She's infamous for her cup ramen moves. What does that mean? She used to send text messages to all the male students at her school. 'Want to meet up and have cup ramen with me?' Do you really think that those guys only ate cup ramen with Oh Se Ryung at her house? You know about that too, don't you? You two went to the same school. Look who it is. I guess you two really do know each other. That's the necklace that PD Lee bought. I almost didn't recognize you. She's a friend of mine. We went to the same school together all throughout high school and college. We did go to the same school together... but we're not friends. You may stick those lips on just anyone... but you should still keep your stories straight. Yeah, okay. We used to be friends. Now we're just acquaintances who used to go to the same school. But why do you look so stiff? You're looking a little lifeless. I wasn't like this earlier... but I guess I'm looking a little stiff from having run into you. My face always freezes up like this when I see anyone who's subhuman. What can I say? I've always been more on the naive side. - Guess you're not happy to see me? - Are you saying you're happy to see me? Why wouldn't I be happy to see you? It's been awhile since I've seen you last. Yeah, I bet you're happy to see me. Since you've always been such a loose woman when it comes to people. You know what 'loose' means, don't you? No, I'm not sure what that means. But I do know that you're being rude and catty right now. It means that it's better than being stiff. Don't pay her any attention. There's no way that Shing-Shing would've changed this much. She's just a woman who only resembles her. So... are you happy to live your life in such a stiff and frozen manner? That's what I'd like to ask you. Whether or not you're happy to be living your life the way you do. I guess she wants to ask you the question. Whether or not you're happy to be with me. What a bunch of jokers. I wish you a ton of happiness. I'm going to take off. Did you do something wrong to her or something? I'm not sure. She really is making a mess of her life, that Shin Joo Yeon. What... did you just say her name was? Shin Joo Yeon. That woman... was my Shing-Shing. That woman... was my Shing-Shing. Subtitles by DramaFever [Next Episode Preview] - Honey! We're here! - Why? Who said that? Who said I was the one that got dumped? Do you think that he was cheating on you with her? Forget it. There's no use talking about this now. There's no reason to be sad. There's always the next relationship. This company... is really tacky. Raise your standards a bit, Director. We need to talk, Team Leader Shin. Well... let's go talk then. That woman from last night... you two don't seem to like each other much? We were in the same classroom for three years in high school and we even used to go to the bathroom together. But I stole her first love away from her. I was a bitch. Was it you... again this time?
