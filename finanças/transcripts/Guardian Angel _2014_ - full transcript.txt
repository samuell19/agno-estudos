(file drawer clicks) (drawer bangs shut) - All right Ms. Robertson, let's start at the beginning, when you first met Ray. - Ray was the best thing that ever happened to me. Can't say that about many people. (gentle music) He was quiet guy, quiet and angry, but, there was that strange kindness to him as well. (gunshots blast) That fierceness that he just couldn't hide. (gunshots blast) (gentle somber music) (wind whipping) Terrible loneliness too. (gentle sorrowful music) He was haunted by the memory and ghost of his dead wife. Hit and run. (gentle somber music) Never got the driver. (gentle music swells) (horns honk distantly) (John laughing) (John sighs) (elevator dings) - Ah, there it is. We're gonna have some fun. (both moan) I can hardly wait, Johnny. - Oh, yeah. Oh my gosh. I think I drank a little too much. (laughs) (Johnny sighs) (bad thuds) (Johnny groaning) - Knock, knock. (laughs) John, John, John, it's your old pal, Gregor. You haven't forgotten about your old friends, have you? Listen John, you have something that belongs to me, that which you took, and I want it back. I'm gonna give you 72 hours, buddy. 72 hours to return what is mine. As for the amount, I'm sure you can recall, as you were my accountant. Where were we? (jaw pops) - How's that? - He's late. Figures, doesn't it? - Thought this was gonna go quickly. I've got a plane to catch. - I still don't see why he has to be here, or what right he has to be here. My father-- - Your father, Fariba, was quite clear. He wanted Ray to be at the reading. I have the codicil to his last request right here. - He's not even a member of this family. He was just married to our poor sister, that's it. - Hm, foolish marriage, poor Roya. Our sister was kind but not wise. - Fariba, please, let's deal with this the best we can. Your father adored Ray. So let's just wait and be a little patient. - Well, that's easy for you to say. I got a meeting this afternoon in Austin. - I don't understand my parents at all. Ray, his family. He was my aunt's husband. What is wrong with you? - Lower your voice, Yasi, and mind your manners. - Why do you hate him so much? - We don't hate him. He's just not our kind of people. He never was. Right, Hooshang? (knocking at door) - Ah, Ray. Come in, have a seat. - Sorry I'm late. - Finally. - We'll note for the record that all the persons in the immediate Kazemi family are present. - Can we cut to the chase and just read what my father has left to him? - I suppose that can be done. I, Korush Kazemi, being of sound mind, do hereby leave to Rahmin Ardalan, my property on 147 Western Avenue. - What property is that, which one? - Is that the 12-unit apartment building? - What? - No, no, it's the small shopping center. - No, no, he can't have it. - Fariba, your father Korush, gave me this attendant letter for you and for your brother, and I think now is an excellent time for you to hear it. "My dear children, do not be angry with me. I wanted to give something to Ray for his immense kindness that he showed to both myself and to my daughter and your dear sister, Roya. Ray is a good man. And I'm sure in time you will understand the nature of my desire in this matter. Your loving father." - Great, so this stranger to the family, this person, just walks out with the asset that could have belonged to my daughter? Hooshang, say something. - Say what? This is your father's wish. - He was obviously delusional when he made that decision. This is an outrage, with all the medication he was on. - Yeah, and all the time he spent with Bubba, he probably convinced him to put him in his will. I will contest this in court. - Uh, where are you going? - [Fariba] Let him go. We'll see you in court. - No need. Maybe you're right, I don't deserve it. I'll sign whatever you want. - Shame on you. - Yasi, Yasi. Oh great. - Ray, wait. Please. Don't mind my parents. You know them. My mom, she doesn't know when to stay still. I'll never forget what you did for me. And you deserve whatever my grandfather wants you to have. You visited him every day in the hospital. Only you. That property is yours. Don't give it up. Promise me you'll think about it. Promise. (slow somber music) - Doctor says you have a concussion and there's bleeding on your brain. - Ooh, sounds ominous. - Can you please tell me what happened? - I fell down. - [Mona] That's it? - Yep. (sighs) - So you were drunk, again. And there was probably a woman. - Oh, please, don't go there. - I don't wanna go there, John. It's been a year. We're separated. The divorce papers are almost finalized, and now I have to come find you like this? I can't trust you. - What do you want? - I want it to end. I never wanted to leave the states, John. I followed you. I did whatever you wanted. I did it. It's always about business with you. - I was a good provider. I did everything for you and Vicki. - John, what you did is a normal part of being a father. You never cared about my feelings. And not about your daughter, either. Which is the reason why she's not even talking to you. - (groans) I just don't need this right now, Mona. - Know what? Neither do I. - (sighs) Mona.

That was the plan, right? - What's going on over there? - Relax. Just a few friends having fun. Are you checking up on me like you always do? - No, I'm not, honey. Listen, I want to talk to you about your father. - No, Mom. I don't want to talk about Dad, okay. You promised. Coming to L.A. was my decision, okay? I'm a big girl, I can handle this. - I know, but-- - No, there's no buts. It's only for a few days, don't ruin it for me. - Okay. When's the big meeting with the agency? - Few days. Please pray for me. They say it's between me and another girl. You don't even know how big this is for me. I mean, imagine your, your daughter's face on billboards. I'm talking about L.A. magazines, entertainment. Hello? Mom? (eerie music) - Hey, hey, I want a shoot with you. Can we shoot? - I don't know, Freddy. - Oh, come on, this town, it's, it's all about your connections and your relationships, and who you know.

Can you please for once just tell me the truth? - Just calm down, calm down. What's, what's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? What kind of sick person does this? - How'd you get these? - [Mona] They were on my car. - When did she go to Los Angeles? - Doesn't matter when she went, she's there right now, John. - Well, isn't anybody gonna tell me? - She doesn't talk to you anymore, remember? - God. - Does this have something to do with you being in the hospital? Some bad business? - Look, Mona, I'll, I'll take care of it. - How are you gonna take care of it? You know what? Maybe I should call the police. - No. No cops. - Why not? - They're (sighs), they're, they're just pictures. - They are not just pictures. Why would somebody take pictures of Vicki in L.A. and put them on my car, John? It looks like they wanted you to see this. - Uh, look, just don't worry her, but get her home as soon as you can. - So this is serious. John, I demand you tell me what's going on right now because I'm not gonna let you put my daughter in danger. - Look, she's my daughter too, and I care about her just as much as you-- (machine beeps rapidly) - John? John? John. - Excuse us, ma'am. Call Dr. Mordecai. Ma'am. - John. - You didn't have to come, boss. I could've taken care of it, but I'm glad you're here. - Is he okay? - Rudy? Yeah, he's fine. Just a little crack to the head. Chased off all the bad guys. It's all good. - How's the wife doing? - Giving birth in a week. - Nervous? - No. Why? - (sighs) Sorry I didn't nail him, boss. Scared him off, nothing was stolen. - That's all right. That's our job. We're human guard dogs. That's why we get paid the big bucks. - Turn around, let me see that. - Oh, it's no big deal. It's nothing. - [Ray] You did good, kid. - Thanks. - Time to go home. - Right. I'll take care of the paperwork. (tense suspenseful music) - Hey. Hey. Thanks for coming, boss. - No problem. - You hungry? - Uh, no, thanks. - Thank you. - And? - There's nothing. I told you this would take time. Ray, there were thousands of black SUV's in L.A. with all the background checks, arrest records. Aside from the description of the car, we don't even have a witness to ID a driver. - It's been a year, Shawn. - I know, but sometimes a confession might come forth from prison, or a witnesses start to talk, when they feel like talking. - So what is this about? - Okay. Here's the story. I got this call from a worried Persian mother. Her daughter is half Persian, half American. She's in L.A. for a few more days. We need someone to keep an eye on her, I thought about your company, what you do. - Why? - You're in the security business. It's a job, a gig. Just, the mom wants her kid to be watched on, and it pays well. - Yeah, but why does she need protection? - The parents are separated. From what I gather, the father was in bad business. Lots of unanswered questions. He's in a hospital with some kind of head injury. Bottom line, the daughter's being stalked because of this. And we have a worried mother. She's an old friend of my wife. So you'll do it? - But Shawn, I do corporate securities, concerts, clubs, stuff like that. - So this is more personal. Just put one of your guys on her from distance, and that's all. (Ray sighs) One more thing. The mom doesn't want her to know she's being watched. So, here are the details. I get this call in the middle of the night. She's an old friend of my wife. - Goodbye. (deep somber music) - John, John, John. (laughs) It's Gregor. (speaks foreign language) You got two days, man. Two days to deliver my groceries. I tell you, man, this... Ah. You look beautiful, my little one. So beautiful. Welcome. (laughs) (Mishka winces) - (gasps) Please. Please, don't hurt me. - Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh. I wouldn't dream of it. I, I'm a creature of love, my sweet. (Mishka gasps) (Mishka groans) - Oh god. (Mishka groans) (table bangs rhythmically) (Mishka crying) (Gregor groans) (Gregor panting) (Mishka shudders) - [Gregor] Now you're mine. I will be protecting you, always. - [TV Reporter] Today, two murders and a robbery in less than 24 hours. And the city citizens are on edge after a gun battle erupts on their city streets. One police officer is killed and four others hospitalized-- - Mm, looks good. - Mm-hmm. - [TV Reporter] The afternoon carnage ended when one of the suspects, later identified as-- - Oh! Oh. - You okay? - Mm. - You okay? - I think it's time. - Breathe, breathe. - Get the bags. - Just breathe, baby. Baby, just breathe. - Honey, get the bags. (phone vibrates) - Hey, Jack. - Boss, look, I'm in a tight spot here. I'd like to leave the house to watch this girl for you, but I can't leave Ana, the baby's premature. I'm kinda stuck. - Look, don't sweat it. - I'm sorry, boss. I can watch her tomorrow if you'd like. You know, after the birth and all. - Jack, stay with your wife. I'll figure something else. - Look, I'm sorry. - Go take care of your wife, and stop talking to me. (phone key beeps) - Okay, let's go.

I know everybody at, at the agencies. I know people at, at CAA at ICM. You have one of those faces, you know? - Freddy.

Just take me home, please. - I'm seriously gonna kill Freddy. Every single time he does that coke, his dick takes over. It's stupid. - Can we just go, Jenny? Please. - Sure, hun. - Thanks. (dog barks distantly) (cellphone rings) Hi, Mom. - Hi, honey. How are you? How was the shoot today? - It went great, really great. I think I got some really hot shots for my book. - I can hardly wait to see them. - Once I get the file, I'll email you some shots. So, you sure everything is okay in old Canada? - Yeah, everything's okay. Um, I just like to hear your voice and know that you're happy. - I'm happy. I'm really happy, everything's great. - Okay, well uh, I gotta go now. I'll talk to you soon, okay? I love you buku. - Love you buku back. - Why did you lie to her? Freddy was a super bastard to you. - That exact reason, Jenny. I don't want her to worry, okay. She's, she's already worried enough with me down here. - And how did you survive puberty, let alone dating? - Wasn't pretty. (phones ring distantly) (knocking at door) - [Tom] Mrs. Robertson? - Yes? - I'm Tom Mordecai. I'm the neurologist on your husband's case. - How serious is it, doctor? - Uh, would you like to sit down? I wish I had better news. Currently, your husband is in a coma. Um, uh, the coma has been caused by massive bleeding in his brain. For the time being, we'll keep him under a medically-induced coma and explore various options for keeping the bleeding under control. We're doing our very best. We'll keep you updated. - Thank you, doctor. (slow somber music) (insects chirping) - No movement. Got herself tucked away inside. - Good. Let me know if things change. Thanks. - Sorry for the wait, Ray. It's good to see you. Please, have a seat. I asked for you to come because I, I wanted to talk to you about the property issue. - There is no issue. - Good, I'm glad to hear that because there has been somebody interested in that property for a very long time. And of course, if you agree, we'll get you a finder's fee or maybe do some profit sharing, we'll find something. - Sure. - Ray, are you okay? How have you been? Are you taking your medication? - Just let me know when you need me. - Oh, Ray. You have cardiomyopathy. You have heart failure, in conjunction with coronary issues. Are you trying to kill yourself? (Hooshang sighs) I'm keeping you on the digoxin and the nitro. It will help manage your pain. But if you don't ta... (Hooshang sighs) (relaxed jazz music) - Yes, Rudy. Yes, I know the place. I'm on my way. (relaxed jazz music) Hey. - Hey. - I'll take it from here, Rudy. Thanks. - All right, boss. I'll be in touch. (tense suspenseful music) (Yasi laughs) - Hi, kiddo. - What a nice surprise to see you here. - You too. - (laughs) That's my Uncle Ray. A man of few words. I, I'm almost ready to tell my parents about what happened. I'm just building up my courage. - I respect that. - So I told him straight up, I am not gonna let you put it there. Some things I just won't do. L.A. guys are just so different. I just want a guy with cash and a car. Did I tell you that Steve has a major crush on me? - I think that's him. That's the guy. - Really? Who is he? - From this morning. - Well go talk to him. - What? - Well, at least you should thank him, right? - Yeah. Yeah. - Oh god, I am major late. Mom's gonna have a heart attack, big family dinner tonight. Remember, don't take my folks too seriously. - Never have. (Yasi chuckles) - Hey. You're the one, right? - [Ray] Excuse me. - I never forget faces. I just wanna say thank you. Can I at least buy you a cup of coffee or something? - Thanks, but-- - Please. I'm just grateful. (gentle music) This is my friend, Jenny. She was just leaving. - What? Oh yeah. I'm so late, but I'm gonna call you later, okay? - Cool. He was very quiet. I did most of the talking, really. Told him about my modeling career and my shitty ex-boyfriend. Little things. He mainly just listened. - So at this point, he never told you about himself? How he just happened to be in the coffee shop the same day he rescued you? - No mention of Gregor Sarkoff? - No. My dad? Forget it. Zero relationship. When he dragged us out of LA to Canada, everything just went downhill. He doesn't approve what I do here. - Modeling? - Right. Spent a fortune on piano lessons. He wanted me to be a concert prodigy, but. - Were you good? - Oh, I'm good at everything I do. (chuckles) No, I play well, okay, but I didn't have the passion. It didn't drive me. I just played by numbers. - If you love what you do, you're going to be great. Modeling, I mean. - Thank you. Thank you. So how 'bout you, mister tall, dark and mysterious? How did you happen to be here today to save me from that creep, Freddy? - Just timing, I guess. - Lucky for me, I thought at the time. And that was it. He was a perfect gentleman. (keys clatter) He even walked me to the front door. - Well, goodnight, Vicki. - Night, Ray. Thanks for the ride. (cricket chirps) (car door clicks open) (car door bangs shut) (car engine turns over) (gentle piano music) (pool balls clacking) (piano music increases in intensity) (machine beeps) (machine hisses) (gentle piano music) (deep pulsating music) And that was the first time I met Ray. Little did I know what the days would bring ahead or, what my mother was going through. (people chattering) (phone rings distantly) - I understand your concern, Mrs. Robertson. Listen, I have my man here, who's on your daughter's security situation. Mrs. Robertson, please meet Ray Ardalan, owner of Ardalan Security Incorporated. - Hello, Mr. Ardalan. - Mrs. Robertson, let me assure you, we've been watching your daughter 24/7. - Thank you. Has Shawn told you about the phone call yet? - What phone call? - A man left a message on my husband's cell phone and it sounded threatening. - No, uh, could you play it for us? - Sure. - [Gregor] John, John, John. (laughs) It's Gregor. (speaking foreign language) You got two days, man. Two days to deliver my groceries. - Mrs. Robertson, could you forward your husband's number to my phone, so I can answer all calls? - Yeah, I, I, I think I can do that. - My number is 8-1-8-5-5-5-0-1-0-0. - Uh, Mrs. Robertson, can you think of anybody down here who your husband was still doing business with? - Or, does he have any friends in L.A.? - Well, he did have a, a business partner a few years ago. - Name? - Anthony Miller. I can text you his number if you like. He was an accountant just like my husband. - Thank you. And uh, try not to worry Mrs. Robertson. I am personally watching Vicki. - Thank you, Mr. Ardalan. I'll be flying to L.A. in the next couple of days, so, um, thank you. (phone beeps) (deep haunting music) - Girl's at this address. - Do we need heat on this, Mr. Sarkoff? - Heat? Yeah, bring your bazooka. Dummy, she's a 20-year-old girl. Bring her to my office, I'll be there in an hour. - You got it. (Gregor sighs) - Mishka. (Gregor sighs heavily) He was a very important client last night. (Mishka winces) (Mishka gasps) You do, (Mishka winces) whatever he asks you to do. (Mishka gasps) (phone ringing) (Rudy sighs) (Rudy clears throat) - Morning, boss. - Rudy, everything okay there? - Yeah, it's all a-okay. - Good. Go home. Get some rest. I'm few minutes away. - You sure? - [Ray] Yeah. Thanks. - All right. Will do. (birds chirping) - There she go. Should we follow her? - Dummy, she's coming right back, right? - All right. All right. We could even wait inside the house for her. (blows) I guess you don't care second hand smoke kills, both like friends and colleagues alike. - Nope. Jesus man, you whine like a bitch. (tense scary music) - One day, you're gonna teach me how to do that. - No can do, my friend. It requires an IQ, which you don't have. (scary pounding music) - Who the hell are you and what're you doin' here? Hm? (intruder grunting and yelling) (adventurous music) - No! No! - Don't you even think about it. - Let go of me. (upbeat techno music) (door creaks) (Ray groans) (gentle piano music) Don't touch me. Who are you really, and what's going on? (slow somber music) - Call your mother. - What? - Call her. (gentle music) - [Vicki] You should've told me. - [Mona] I didn't wanna worry you, honey. - [Vicki] What does all this have to do with? - It has to do with your father. He was involved in some bad business. - Jesus, figures. - Listen, sweetheart, I want you to do everything that man tells you to do. And in the meantime, I'm gonna book you a plane ticket and get you back home, okay? - No. I can't do that, I need tomorrow. Remember? The agency meeting? - Yes, I remember. Put him on the phone, please. - Yeah? - Mr. Ardalan, you're all I have right now. So, I'm going to do whatever you ask me to do, because she doesn't want to come home. - Let me talk to her. I'll get back to you. - Please do. - [Ray] We're leaving. - [Vicki] Why? - Just don't argue, if you wanna stay in town. (gentle music) - Where are we going? - To my place. - You know you could've, could've told me who you were, and what you were doing. - I'm doing my job. - Yeah. I actually thought we were friends. (somber music) Where's the wife, Ray? Figures you'd be alone. I have this birthday thing for my friend Jenny tonight. - Not a good idea. - Why worry? You'll be there. (phone buzzing) - Yeah? - This obviously is not John. Who the fuck is this? - What is it you need? - Let me guess. You're the tough guy who poked fun at my friends. Am I right? You're the watchdog. - It's about money, isn't it? (jaw pops) - Brilliant. You're a fuckin' genius. Yeah it's about money. Her cheat of a father stole 1.3 mil from me. So she's mine as collateral. - Maybe we should meet. - Uh, a negotiator. Yeah, why don't we do that. Two hours. - Fine. - I'll call ya, and give ya an address. (phone buzzes) - Yeah, Shawn? Yes, I'll be there. (mysterious music) - Hey. Ray. This is detective Scott Jackson. He's good people. I got the info on your guy. Anthony Miller is, he's dead. Some kind of accident six months ago. - From what I understand, you may be getting yourself into some hot water. - Scott is right. Maybe the best thing is to send the girl home. - And then what? - She's not your problem anymore. Even if she stays here, there's not a whole lot we can do. - We need direct evidence, not circumstantial. We don't even know who's after her. - So basically you can come into the picture when she's hurt. - You want her safe, send her home. - What if I find out who's in charge? - That's not your job, Ray? - Is there something you're not telling us, Ray? - I'll let you know when I do. - Listen, pal, there's some well-connected people out there, and I mean legitimately-connected people, with higher-ups. Can't touch them. This accident Anthony had may not have been an accident. If these guys are after the girl's father and then the ex-partner ends up dead, I don't buy it. - And yet, you just want her to go home. - Yes. Believe me, this is the best thing to do. - So sometimes it's better to let things go, right? - Look Ray, I know you're chasing a ghost from the past, but don't confuse the situation. - Sorry about your wife. But he's right. - I'll talk to her. - Sorry, Shawn. He's not gonna talk to her. (knocking at door) - Hi. - Hi. Who are you? Where's Ray? - That's a long story. Come in.

Back in the glory days of the grand economy, I had uh John, he was one of my accountants and there was, there was a lotta cash involved, a whole lotta cash, we were always making tons of money. It was fantastic. Crash hit, lost all our money. We all went our own separate ways, then a couple years later, I find out, ole Johnny boy, he goes up to Canada, and he starts investing in apartment buildings with my fucking money. Money that he embezzled from me, see. Now imagine my disappointment. - Well, the bad news is, Johnny is in a coma. (jaw popping) - In a coma? Jesus fucking Christ. Well, that is bad news. Be sure to send some flowers by in the morning, but as I'm sure you'll agree, at least until he wakes up, I gotta have myself a little bit of collateral. And she's pretty, isn't she? So sweet, innocent. Beautiful young girl. (Gregor laughs) - What if I can get you the money? - Who the fuck are you to come up with that kind of bling, huh? - I need two weeks. And you stay away from the girl. (Gregor laughs) - I'm gonna give you two days. Two days, Ray. Hey, Ray. It's between you and me now, you understand that? (relaxed techno music) Find out where he and the girl are staying. - Gregor, he's not stupid.

You, my friend, look horrible. - It's nothing. - Right. Dad knew you wouldn't fill these prescriptions, so he had me do it for you. I'm gonna load you up, right now. And this is the nitroglycerin for when the pain kicks in. Under the tongue, sir. Doctor's orders. - You treat me like a kid, kiddo. - You're still my uncle. I gotta roll. I gotta study for a big European history test tomorrow. - Yasi. Thanks. - She's a good girl. A little scared, but I know she's in good hands. (keys clatter) (gentle somber music) - I didn't have time to take all my clothes so, I took a dress from the closet. Hope that's okay? (gentle sorrowful music) - We're not staying long. (techno dance music) (patrons chattering) - Whoo! All right, all right, all right. Yeah. Whoo! Birthday girl, happy birthday. Cheers. (techno dance music) (crowd chatters excitedly) Come on, let's dance. - I don't dance. - Please? - You go and have fun. - Come on, girl, let's move. (techno dance music) (crowd chattering) - Hey, hey. What's up, Dad? - It's fine, Ray. He's a dancer. You don't wanna dance, so. Yeah, if you don't want to. (techno dance music) - [Ray] Time to go. - You again? (Ray thuds) (Vicki gasps) What do you got? (man grunts) (woman screams) Hey, old man! (men grunting and groaning) (man groans) (upbeat techno dance music) - Ray, I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry. (tense music) - He want to see if he can trust you. (tense music) - Don't. (Mishka groans) - You fix her up, then bring her back. Do anything different, the deal's off. You know what the hell that means. (haunting music) (Mishka whimpers) - Get some towels and water. Just hang in there. (telephone rings) - Boss, what kind of job did you take? - It's complicated. - What's the plan? - I need a safe house. - I think I know the right spot. It's a little outta town. - I was so afraid. Who were these people? And what did my father do? She was cut up like a piece of meat. Fuckin' animals. (tense pulsating music) - Who was the girl? - It was the first time I saw her. - What was her name? - Mishka. - Did she have a last name? - Only Mishka. Doctor fixed her up real good, and we headed to his friend's house. - Where was this place? In town, out of town? - I don't know. We drove for about an hour. I think we took the five north. - Do you remember the doctor's name? - [Vicki] I don't know. - Who was he? Friend of Ray's? - I just told you, okay. I don't know. Maybe he wasn't even a real doctor, okay. He sewed her up and left. (tense music) (insects chirping) (Mishka whimpers) - It's okay, sweetheart. You're safe now. (Mishka groans) - Thank you. - You need to rest. - I need to go back. I must go back. - You don't have to do that. - [Vicki] They almost killed you tonight. - You don't understand. I can't hide. - It's all right, honey. We'll talk about it in the morning, okay. You just need to sleep. You need to sleep. (liquid dribbling) Where'd all this go? Your smile? Joy? You know, they say that there are things in life that we have no control over. There're things we do. Smiling is one of them. Ray, I need to know the truth. Please talk to me. - It's about money. Money your father took from some people. - What money? How much? All, all this over money? And, why is Mom involved? Isn't that Dad's problem? Did you talk to him? - No. - Then why don't you? - You don't know, do you? (cup thuds) - Know what? That, that he's in the hospital? - She didn't tell you, did she? - Tell me what? - That's your fa-, (sighs) That your father is in a coma. - Oh my god. Poor mother. (gentle somber music) This is real. How much money does Dad owe? - A lot. And we only have two days. - Two days? And what, what if we can't pay? What happens then? And, what does Mishka have to do with all this? Is she, is she a warning? She is, isn't she? What if I go back home? Say something. - It's up to you. If they got to your dad, they can get to you too. - Well, what if we call the cops? - (scoffs softly) It's more complicated than that. (gentle piano music) (crickets chirping) (mysterious music) (gentle music) - I was so afraid. (wind whipping) (birds chirping) Ray, Ray, wake up. She's gone. (tense adventurous music) (gentle somber music) Why, why'd she leave? She could have gotten away from those bastards. - I know. She's terrified. (sighs) It's typical, trying to return to her tormentor. - But they're gonna kill her, eventually. - She's already dead inside. - Poor girl. Every dream she had is just gone or lost. Everything seems so unimportant and trivial, my modeling career. - Vicki, what is it you want? - I wanna live, okay? I don't wanna be like Mishka. I'm not going back home. - What time is your meeting? - A few hours. - Come on, get cleaned up and beautiful. (elevator dings) (computer keys clicking) - They're ready for you, Miss Robertson. - Thank you. Wish me luck. - You don't need luck. (computer keys clicking) - Miss Robertson. - Hi. - May I call you Vicki? - Yes, of course. - Thank you. Well, looking at and judging from your modeling photos, Vicki, we can appreciate your uniqueness and we can see the passion in your eyes. But as you know, this campaign is not just about beauty and still photography. - Yes. We need to make sure that the essence that you capture in your photos translates to film. - I know it's a short notice. Let your folks know I'll be stopping by tonight. Thanks, Yasi. Bye. - Everyone needs a partner, for different reasons. Use my reason, for no reason at all. - Very nice. Thank you, Ms. Robertson. - I'm sorry. Could I, could I do that one more time, please? - All right. - Everyone needs a partner for different reasons. With the right partner, use my reason, for no reason at all. - Vicki, why did you change the copy? - I wanted to make it more personal. - Personal? - Yeah, well, my reason tells me this product is about trust and loyalty, with the right partner, that is. Well, trust and loyalty are the most important virtues in a man for any woman, no matter how old she is. (intriguing music) - Ms. Robertson, will you give us a few minutes and step outside? - Sure. (uplifted music) - Miss Robertson, I'm afraid you'll be staying in the United States longer than you expected. - What does that mean? - We'll be contacting your agent. (intriguing music) - Now I actually have a reason to call my mom. You have no idea how important this job is to me. Ray! Ray! Let go of me. - Shut up. (tense music) - [Kidnapper] Don't be foolish. - [Ray] I have one more day. - Yes, yes you do. (Vicki gasps) Nothing will happen to her, if you keep your promise. Bye now. (tense music) - You fucking broke my nose (indistinct). (feet thudding) (dramatic bang) (police radio chattering) - [Paramedic] You're gonna be fine. - Ray, what the hell happened? What's going on? Why don't you answer my calls? - According to Ray here, they snatched the girl. - Dammit, I told you she had to be sent home. - We don't have time for this. She needs us more than ever. - Us? This is a police matter now. - You're gonna let us handle this from here. You're out. - You need me to get to these people. - We need you to go down to the station and give us a statement. - Don't you get it? We don't have time. You need subpoenas, warrants. It takes too long. - I don't need you to tell me how to do my job. If you had taken my advice, we wouldn't even be talking right now. - I'm done talking. What is your plan? - Well, obviously they need something from you. They'll contact you, they'll... Shawn, you get him down to the station. I need a full report. - Can I get some water? - Sure. I see what I can do. (door bangs) (intriguing music) - Tell me she's as safe as a baby in its bed. - He'd like to talk to you. - Ray? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I am now. - You know the rules. What's gonna make me happy? - The deed to a shopping mall. - A property? What the fuck am I gonna do with a shopping mall? We were talking cash. - It's worth a lot more than you think. - Well, I am a businessman. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to consider it. All right. Tell you what, we'll meet tonight. We'll uh, we'll be in touch. Oh, and uh Ray, don't be stupid. Come alone. Otherwise. - Don't. (Vicki yells) (Ray sighs) - Thanks for seeing me. - Ray, what happened to you here? - A small accident. - I don't know what's on your mind, but I also have all the paperwork ready, deed and transfer documents. - Fariba, please, let's first listen to what Ray has to say. - I don't know how to say this, but I'm in a situation, I cannot give up this property. - (scoffs) I knew it from the beginning. What did I tell you? I'm taking you to court. Is that what you want? - It is his property. - And he has the right to keep it. - It's none of your business, Yasiman, stay out of this. - I'm sorry to disappoint you. - Disappoint me? Oh no. I was disappointed a long time ago. Having you as a brother, that was disappointing enough. - [Hooshang] Fariba. - Just looking at you brings me nothing but sorrow. Where's my sister now, huh? She's dead. Why not you instead of her? - Fariba John. Enough, stop. - Mom. Why are you doing this? - It's our family property. He didn't earn it. - Well, your father gave it to him. - And he loved Aunt Roya. - Yes, but he couldn't take care of her. He wasn't there for her! - [Hooshang] It was an accident. - But why it happen to my sister, why? - Shit happens. It happened to me too. - Yasi, what are you talking about? - (scoffs) I don't even know where to start. This is why couldn't tell you. - Tell us what? - Anything. You're just not listening, ever. All you do is judge. - No, no, we don't judge you, sweetie. - There are things I need her to hear from me. Things I couldn't tell you. - [Fariba] Tell me what? - Tell you what happened to me. And that this man that you hate so much was there to help me. - Ray, what is she talking about? - Yasi, you can talk to me. I'm listening, okay? What happened? - A few months back, I went to some dumb party with these girls, I wasn't even invited to. I didn't know anyone. Music was pounding. Lots of people. Guys. And one guy handed me a drink. I remember feeling dizzy. And the guys, they were all staring at me. It took me a while to find a bathroom. And I felt like they were following me. I closed the door. I didn't know what to do. I called Ray. I was so afraid. Nothing felt right. I just remember he said, "Lock the door." Everything was spinning. And then the door, someone was trying to get in. And then they started pounding. I heard them laughing outside, telling me to open up. All I remember after that was waking up in a bed with an IV in my arm, and some old guy trying to give me a shot. And Ray was there. I made Ray promise to never mention what happened. I was this close to getting raped. Shit happens, mother. So every time you treat him so badly, you're stabbing my heart. Ray took care of me. He takes care of everyone. (gentle somber music) - Oh. Oh, baby. Come here, come here. Okay. - Oh Yasi, we didn't know, honey, we didn't know. - Now you do. You still wanna fight him over that stupid property? - No honey, I'm so sorry, I've been such a fool. I'm so sorry. (crying) I'm so sorry. Sweetheart. (slow somber music) Ray. My sister was lucky to have you. (suspenseful music) - [Vicki] Ray! - You okay? The documents are signed, along with the deed. - Attila. (Gregor laughs) (Gregor clapping) Bravo. Good job, Ray. You did good, didn't think you had it in ya. We'll uh, we'll make sure that it's all legit. - It's all good. - How much they paying you, Ray? Huh? Probably just enough to keep yourself in rent. You're driving around in that secondhand shit box you call a car. I can pay you a hell of a lot more money. I could use a guy like you. - I know you could. All I want is for her to be free. - I want the same thing. Just imagine, right? I ask you to do a little something, a little something here, little something there. Right? She can always be free as a bird. - What is it you want? - You have a security company. I have a company needs security. Mean, just having you here, I feel safer already. (Gregor laughs) Oh, Vicki here, right? She can go home, go home to her mom, pursue her dreams. Meet a nice boy, have a couple a kids. I don't give a rat's ass. But only if, you come back, and we do a little bit of business. You understand? - I do. - No, no, no, no, Ray. She belongs in my world. (tense mysterious music) (dog barks distantly) (car alert beeps) - (sighs) You're safe now. Shawn will take care of you. - Is it really over, Ray? - You're going to be fine, Vicki. - Why'd you give up your property for me? - It wasn't for you. - I don't understand. - I had to do it for myself. - Am I gonna see you again? - Goodbye, Vicki. - I don't know how I'll ever thank you enough. You saved my life. - No need, just be good. - Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. (gentle melancholic music) Going back to them, aren't ya? Please tell me you're not. - I have to finish this. - Why? I'm here, right? Come with me. Come back to Canada with me. - I can't. - Sure you can. You can do anything you want. We can be together. We can start over. You can have your own business. I have money saved up. We can be happy. - Listen, Vicki. He'll never stop coming after you. Never. (gentle somber music) Goodbye, Vicki. - No. No. No goodbyes. (gentle somber music) - Where's he going? - Only he knows that. That was the last time I saw him. - All right, that's enough. She's told all she knows. - But the most important question is yet to be answered. - No more questions until you tell us exactly what went down.

Makes no sense. - It does. Scumbags like you never stop. (Gregor laughs heartedly) - So what now? (gunshots blasting) - Now what I have to ask you, and this is very important. Where do you think Ray is? - What? - What are you trying to say? - It's a simple question. Ray is a suspect in a murder whose whereabouts are currently unknown. - What makes you think Ray was even involved in this? - We found his jacket, bloodied, at the crime scene. (Shawn sighs) - Vicki, Ray may have saved your life, but in so doing, he's gotten his hands dirty in the process. - Think! Please. Where could he be? - I really don't know. But if you find him, it'll only be on his terms. His terms. (fist knocking) (Keller sighs) (telephone ringing) (people chattering) (gentle piano music) (telephone ringing) Ray? - It's not Ray.
