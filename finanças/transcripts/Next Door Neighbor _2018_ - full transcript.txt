May I please have your attention? Korean Air flight number 1033 has arrived. Please go to gate number... GIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT How long has it been? It's been three years, two months, and two weeks. That was a long time. Three years. Is Ye-jun in elementary school already? Yes. My daughter is in her second year in college. Is that right? You must miss them a lot. It's not just me. It's the same for you, too. I'm just worried that the kids will feel awkward. I doubt that. I'm sure they're proud of their dad. LUGGAGE CARTS My man. Nothing will happen in broad daylight. - Don't worry. - Yes, sir. Our bags are out. - Let me get that. - Thanks. - No! - Sir! - Ui-sik! - Sir! Stop right there! PROHIBITED AREA LEE UI-SIK INDICATES INTEREST IN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT RETURN TO KOREA FLARES CRITICISM IN OPPOSITION AND POLITICAL CIRCLES LEE UI-SIK SUDDENLY RETURNS TO KOREA LEE UI-SIK DISAPPEARS IN AIRPORT CITIZENS ANGRY AT LEE UI-SIK'S DISAPPEARANCE PROTESTORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY DEMAND AN EXPLANATION BEST FRIEND Damn it. That commie asshole. Isn't there a way to frame him? We should put him on house arrest so he can't go anywhere. What the hell is house arrest? We'll make his house a prison. Make his house a prison? Yes. We can make his house a prison and trap him there so he can't do anything until the presidential election. Even the mighty Lee Ui-sik won't be able to do anything. Then the people will complain that we locked him up and demand we release him. Then we'll look for an opportunity to frame him for being a commie. A commie? Yes, that sounds good. Do you remember Yoo Dae-gwon? He got into a fistfight with men who went to the Military Academy and got sent to Busan. The surveillance team captain. Yeah, that nutjob? Is he a patriot? Yes, a big one. Release him! Release Lee Ui-sik! What the... Damn it. They should check the equipment. Do they think commies don't take dumps? Look at that. They couldn't even hide the tracker properly. Shit. The commies even shit red. Those bastards. It even smells rotten. What did they say? We're gathering in Sinchon on the 16th. The Seoul guys are gathering at the rotary at 3 p.m. that day. Are we bringing the alliance leader? He's in our club room right now. - Where? - There. Look at these commies. You make the best wraps. I didn't want to watch my hands ever again because these hands caught the National College Students Alliance leader. Where do you live? - Pardon? - Your home. I live in Gamcheon-dong in Busan. - Do you own? - No, sir. It's a monthly rental. - Dong-hyeok. - Yes, sir. A patriot like this should not be living in a monthly rental. Right? It's your reward for catching a commie. I want you to mark Lee Ui-sik well so that he can't participate in the presidential election. And go with me to the Blue House. I'm good. You eat, Mother. No, no. I'm fine. You're the one doing all the work. You need to eat up. You got promoted. Now you're going to the US for work. It isn't easy to be so appreciated at a company. This is all thanks to you, Mother. - Goodness. - Please, eat. We have decided not to detain Chairman Lee UI-sik, the chairman of the opposition party, but keep him under house arrest as we continue with the investigation. This is because our administration highly values human rights... They're always yapping about commies. I didn't know my hubby was interested in politics. - Should I turn it on? - No, no. It's fine. Eat. They say Lee Ui-sik is a commie. Everyone in the neighborhood is talking about it. - That's all a lie. - What? Hey, punk. How do you know that? Even Min-seong knows that. Do you demonstrate? No. Why would I? You can't protest and stuff for the commies, got it? You worked so hard to get into Seoul University. Okay. Min-seong. Didn't I tell you not to eat with your left hand? Are you a leftist? Stop it. He's just a kid. What, Min-seong? You got something to say to me? I want to learn taekwondo. Why? What for? You want to be a gangster? Then maybe a puppy... A puppy? There will be dog fur all over the house. You'd better study hard! Got that? Why are you making him cry? Seriously. - It's okay. Don't cry. - It's okay. - How long has it been? - Two hours. Two hours? Mom. I guess the reporters can't get through at all. Those shitheads. Bastards. I made so many for the reporters. They can't even take pictures. Shit. This is clearly suppression of the press. You are infringing on the people's right to know. - Who are you? - I'm the newsroom director. I don't care about no newsroom or a right to know. How could a police officer say that? Which precinct are you with? What will you do if you know? - Get back! - I will not! - Why you little... - You. Who are you? Don't you know you can't go through? Well... But you know... Yes. Hey. Let him through. What the heck? Who is he? Why are you letting him go? He lives here. - Why won't you let us through? - Leave already. Hey! Get him! Stop him! Let go! Get the baldy, assholes! Get the baldy! Get the baldy! The baldy! Sir! You're well, right? There was a leak, so we can't hold the press conference today! Chairman Lee! Please tell me if you have something to say to Aide Han and Assemblyman Yang! DON'T TAKE AWAY HIS FREEDOM -Sir! -Look over here! - No! Let go, asshole! - Please tell me! - Get down, asshole! - Let go. Let go. Let go of me! Chairman Lee! Chairman Lee! They're all being arrested. Shouldn't we report this? Why would we report that we're grilling? Not that. About the mess out there. The recorder is still going. Just pour the drinks. You dense idiot. Hey, you. Who are you? How did you get in? Is this porridge? Are you the new... Please have a seat. Here. The alley is a real shit show because they're trying to catch commies. Finish stuffing your face, and go home. - What did he just say? - I think you were fired. Damn. Shit. - What is this? - Storage. Storage? What's this curtain? Yes, well... It's American. We got silk so that people can't see in. Did I ask about the fabric? Are you announcing to everyone that we're on surveillance? Shit. You've got to be kidding me. What the hell is this? - So... - I-It's Hawaii. - It's Waikiki. - These are props. This is company policy. You know how our job is a secret. -When write to families, -Show him. we take pictures like we're abroad... You get drunk, play cards, eat ramyun. Are you camping? Is this a boy scouts camp? Get out and bring in the equipment. Get out and bring in the equipment! Change the curtain to something less obvious. Use a pattern that's popular in the neighborhood. Rearrange all of the furniture and everything in here so it's as similar as possible to this house. Got that? Yes, sir! We will sleep, eat, and take dumps at exactly the same times as Lee Ui-sik, 24-7. When he takes a dump, is it dry or runny? Does his speech change when he's nervous? Log every little detail. Leave nothing out. We will be his shadow 24 hours a day. And Yeong-cheol. -See what the housekeeper buys, -Have a nice day. if she talks to anyone, everything. What the hell? You fucking bastard. EUNJIN'S ROOM, YEJUN'S ROOM, KITCHEN PERSONAL CARD Nice. Very nice. Just wait, commie. I'll make you rot in jail for the rest of your life. KOO YEONG-JA PREPARES LUNCH EUN-JIN HELPS YE-JUN READ DATE: SEPTEMBER 9, 1985 PRIORITY: URGENT ...LIKELY PLANNED BY AIDE HAN AND ASSEMBLYMAN YANG MAN-SEOB Is he associated with them as claimed? How do you feel? Chairman Lee Ui-sik is under house arrest! - Stop him. - The current administration... Cancel the house arrest! Cancel the house arrest! Cancel the house arrest! Hey! How did you know it was Aide Han and Assemblyman Yang? Well, a few days before the press conference, Aide Han and Assemblyman Yang had visited him. So I listened to the recordings marked by dates. I noticed something strange. Hey, you son of a bitch. What are you doing? You want to die? Madam. 90813. September 8, 13th hour. It was the date that Lee Ui-sik was trying to meet with the press. Dong-hyeok, this guy is a real piece of work. Be my little brother from now on. - Give me your hand. - Yes, sir. - Your left hand. - Yes, sir. No, sir. I'm fine. Can't a big brother give a gift to his little brother? It's okay. Take it. - Here. - Thank you, sir. It was from the President. It looks good. Do you need anything else? - Well... So... - Go ahead. So... About Lee Ui-sik's kids. His kids? I heard his report. Why don't you hear him out? Mister! Can't you throw me my soccer ball? You cannot come out. Our dad is under house arrest, not us. You cannot come out without an order. We just want our ball. Why do we need an order? Foreign reporters are watching. Can we let the kids go to school and let Lee Ui-sik's friends visit him? Then people won't complain about human rights, and a dragonfish may naturally get caught on our fishing hook. My brother's amusing. Who's the dragonfish? Min No-guk. - No-guk. - Ui-sik. You've been through so much. Don't you ever age? Your skin looks good from bumming around. - Have you eaten? - I starved for three days. - Let's go. - Honey. Honey! Did an ancestor starve to death? He always talks about eating. Okay. - Hey. Not yet. - Here. He must have an appetite since you're here. Of course. No-guk is the best at mixing rice. I do it all the time, but even I impress myself at times. You're so funny. Enjoy. Here. My god. LIVING ROOM Here. What is this? - I heard from Aide Han. - Aide Han. That kid. I was only throwing it out there. Throwing it out. He said he threw it out. - Like garbage? - Maybe? The composition is key. It's incredibly strong. It may get rid of it in one go. In one go? - One go? - Getting rid of something. These commie assholes. What are they up to? I'm sure there's a reason why they let me in here. Wiretapping? Am I being bugged? No? Okay. You scared the people listening. Shit. Also, about your candidacy for the presidential election. We've come to an agreement with college professors in Seoul. It looks like the religious groups want to support their own. I'm worried we'll split the votes among ourselves at this rate. You need to get... There. Checkmate. I was trying to have a serious conversation. This doesn't count. - Replay. - Excuse me. What are they doing? Why don't they say it? - I want a redo. You cheap jerk. - Come here. - Come closer. - You... A little more. Hold on. I have a move. If I do this, it's no longer checkmate. Then I'm safe. Get over here. Give me your forehead. You should've seen that first. This is wrong. - Let's play another game. - Stop it. Seriously. Are they messing with us? What's fair is fair. Let's have some tea. What is that sound? Isn't he eating a bun or something? It sounds like the crinkling of a wrapper. Why would he eat a bun while everyone's sleeping? I think... - You think? - I think it's code. - Code? - Like Morse code. Using a steady sound... to send a signal. - Was that steady? - Wasn't it? Crinkle. - Who is he signaling? - The commies. I'm going step on you and snuff your life out. Are you a commie? I'm sorry. Crinkle. What was that sound? May I bum a smoke? Will they arrest you just for talking to me? Giving me a cigarette is fine, so let me borrow one. - Sir. - We've been made. We've totally been made. It was dark, so I'm sure he didn't see my face. - Darn it. - Dad. - It started. Hurry. - "Starry Night." Hello, this is Lee Moon-sae. Okay, here's the first letter for tonight. He has been sending us many fun stories. -It's from -That's it. the forever jobless bum in Seongbuk-dong, Jun's dad. I'd love to meet him sometime. Should I invite him to be a guest on our show? I realize how precious - time with my family is. - Seongbuk-dong. My son complaining makes me happy. - Jun's dad. - My daughter who's dieting -but eats two bowls of rice -Dad. - makes me happy. - Is it three? -The scorched rice my wife makes me -Seriously. also makes me happy. I'm also happy because of Kkeu-sun who always tends to me - Me? - as well. - You even mentioned me? - I envy you. As always, his song request is Nami's "Round and Round." Ta-da! - Nice. - You're good. Nice. You're good. Oh my gosh, you're good. Okay! Hold on. Isn't this about Lee Ui-sik? I think so, but maybe not. Hold on. - It is. - You startled me. Jun. Ye-jun. It's Lee Ui-sik's son. When did he mail in that story? This isn't a story, it's code. Again? Nami. "Round and Round." You just watch me. You just wait and see. What kind of code is that? He's saying don't just wait and see, and to act quickly. - Do what? - Like the demonstrations? Correct. What do we do about our government? Grab the citizens' hands and spin round and round. What could that mean? Spin round and round. Like how Admiral Yi Sun-sin made people do that dance so it looked like there were more soldiers during the Japanese Invasion? What was it called? - "Ganggangsulae"? - "Ganggangsulae." "Ganggangsulae." Lee Ui-sik, who likes makgeolli requested a dance song four times. Four times? Yes. Hey. - September 8th. - The 8th. - September 9th. - The 9th. - September 11th. - The 11th. And today. That's without a doubt a command to North Korea. A command? That seems like a stretch. A stretch? Will you take responsibility? Why should I? If he explains it explicitly, how is that code? Don't you agree, sir? Hey. - Write up a report. - What? NAMI'S SONG "ROUND AND ROUND"... AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY PLANNING - Dong-hyeok. - Yes, sir. Ban "Round and Round," "Spin and Spin," and all those songs that commies wrote! Yes, sir. Then... "Rotating Samgakji..." Ban it. - "Around and Around and Around"? - Ban it all! Why are there so many songs with "spin" and "turn" in it? That's why Korea is spinning out of control! What about that song? "Return to Busan Harbor"! It's the President's favorite song. Leave that one out. Yes, sir. Ring Around the Rosie Pocket full of posies Is that okay? Nami's "Round and Round" was banned. I think it was because you like it. To suffocate you. How did they know I like it? Uncle. You'll give me a ride to school, right? Of course, I will escort you. - Let's go. - Bye. Also, about your candidacy for president. I'm going to meet... - What happened? - Why is this acting up? - Hurry. - I think it's the bug. So we changed the venue. - It's working. - Changed to where? - Uncle. - Okay. Dad, Mom said to patch up the wall. - Okay, I will. - Bye. Did they leave? - What are you doing? - It worked when he hit it. That's not the problem. What are you doing? Aren't you going to get the bug? That's a hole for dogs. Shit. I was just looking. We'll use the platform for the crocks. What's that? Excuse me. Is somebody there? I thought I heard voices. Get over here. Is anyone there? Hello, sir. It's you from the roof. Pardon? Yes, so... Shit. Wait. Your face looks so much smaller - than on TV. - Really? What's wrong with him? Excuse me. Would you throw me my trowel? Shit. I hope I hit you and kill you. Is he dead? Don't you even care whether or not you killed a man? Are you okay? I guess I won't die from it. So why are you fixing up the wall? Are you bored? It'll be winter soon. What if snow gathers and it crumbles? People will get hurt. You're screwed. Worry about yourself. What was that? What? What... What was what? ♪ You just watch me ♪ ♪ You just ♪ That song is banned. They'll lock you up if they catch you singing it. How is that any different from saying you're a commie just because you wear red? Maybe Lee Ui-sik has us bugged. You think so, too? I shouldn't have said anything. I'm fine. - Okay. - All done. Thank goodness he didn't die. What is this? THANK YOU. THESE ARE FROM OUR GARDEN. I HOPE YOU ENJOY. FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR... My neighbor, my ass. Maybe it's laced with rat poison. The North may have sent orders to eliminate us. Why don't you trust people? I don't. You said it wasn't hot last time, too. Ye-jun, it really isn't hot. Don't you trust your big sister? Eun-jin says to trust her, so shut up and eat. No. You have to put a piece of pork belly, and then a slice of kimchi and soybean paste. Then you stuff it into your mouth. That's how you eat it. That's right. That plus soju... We have to eat exactly what they eat. Screw it. Let's just starve. What? Just eat. A man must eat everything in order to do great things. - Okay? - Okay. To do great things. Grill up some pork belly, add a slice of kimchi and some soybean paste... Lee Ui-sik and we are in the same position. We're also under house arrest. Look at his watch. How nice is that? Captain. Your watch. This is what's truly awesome. It's from the President. The President. - What? - The phoenix spread its wings. - What? - It's awesome. Gosh. Ye-jun must have caught a cold. He must have the flu. That's Eun-jin. YE-JUN'S ROOM EUN-JIN'S ROOM MASTER BEDROOM What is that? MENTIONS FURNACE AND CARBON MONOXIDE LEAK Sir. Carbon monoxide. Hold on. Then... The police... No. Shouldn't we call an ambulance? And say we're surveilling them? We can't just leave them. This is a big problem. Shit. Eun-jin. What are you doing? Shit. Shit. Can't you hit it? What do you think patriotism is? It's... It's loving your country. So why did you save the commie? Pardon? Whether or not he dies from carbon monoxide poisoning, you should've just let him be. Sir, but that's... It's been two months. Did living next door to the commie make you soft on him? No, sir. I thought we should tie them to the organization of commies, so we couldn't let them die. Why are you making judgment calls? All you have to do is tie the dragonfish to the commies. That's your duty. Got that? Yes, sir. Look at this. Spy ring... Let's tie Lee Ui-sik to spies. What? Spies? If we don't have any justification, we have to create one. Lee Ui-sik? Sir, we're intelligence agents, not field operatives. Do you think field operatives are so special? - Yes. - Why you... LEE UI-SIK NORTH KOREA EVIDENCE PROJECT "Lee Ui-sik North Korea Evidence Project." Project Lee-N-Ev. SEONGBUK POWER The plan and diagram are as you can see. LEE UI-SIK HOUSE LAYOUT Lee-ho-la. Based on gathered data, at precisely 13:10, his housekeeper will leave for the market. That's when we infiltrate, disguised as power company workers. We plant the spy documents, then withdraw. Mission success. We must finish before the housekeeper returns. Because she is cruel enough to kill a rat in the kitchen by stepping on it until it dies. That is all. See? There's nothing to being a field operative. Okay. Good. - Then this time... What was it? - The crinkle? Right. The crinkling sound. We must find out what it is, understood? Yes, sir! What's that? What? What is it? Hey. Your door was open. The door was open, so my heart is opening. What? Excuse me? I can see your dimples when you smile. Shit. That moron. Mister, have some spicy rice cakes. Our dad made it. I guess you don't have any children. I need a woman first before I could have a kid. Excuse me? Anyway. Why don't you come in and rest your feet? Rest my feet for what? What? Y-You should g-get going. - Okay. - Good day. Okay, then. What's taking the kids so long? Kkeut-sun! Dad? - Dad? What dad? - Dad! - Hurry. - You can't go in there. - Hey! You can't! - Ye-jun! I just took a bath. Excuse me? My... My b-big brother. I hope you like it. It's Dad! Dad? What dad? Our Dad. I'm sure I heard his voice. No. How could you hear your dad's voice when he's at home? You must have misheard. I'm sure of it. Don't touch that. I hope you like it. I hope you like it. What the heck? I see. It's his voice. He's... He's a theater actor. I hope you like it. Then act like a snake. It's a snake. It looks just like a snake. It's a snake. Ye-jun, it's a snake. Hey, Ye-jun! Let's go. Okay, Ye-jun. I think your sister's calling for you. - Want to go home? - Want to go home? - Let's go home. - Good boy. Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. So is he... your older brother? Me? - Big brother. - Little brother. He's my big brother. He's so cute. Have a nice day. I should break every bone in your body. Are you insane? You should've sent her away. I'm sorry, Dae-gwon! I mean, Captain. "Why don't you come in?" Have you lost your mind? Once my eyes met hers, it was like I was bewitched. They saw our faces. What do we do now? Yeong-cheol. Boil some potatoes. My mother told me until my ears bled to never return plates empty. You have a great mother. Please come in. Okay. This is my life these days. Goodness. Do you have athlete's foot? Yes. I have something that'll end it in one go. Do you want to try? I'm okay. Say hi. He lives next door. - Hello. - She's our eldest. I met Eun-jin earlier. How do you know my name? Well... Since we live next door, I can hear you when you call your daughter. Sure. I guess you don't live with your family. No. My wife and son live in Busan. Busan. Are you here for work? - Pardon? - My son said you had a lot of electronics and several phones. We're fucked. Yes, the phones. How do I describe it? Say it's a lab. A research lab. It... It's like a research lab. Research. Yes, like sound and electricity. We research them. Do you by chance... By chance what? Wait just a minute. - He knows. - He knows? He knows. He totally knows. No. There must be a way. Not yet. - He was too awkward. - No. Why does he have so many books? Where should I hide it? Where should I hide it? - Crinkle. - Crinkle. Yes. That's it. "Glacial acetic acid"? Lee Ui-sik left the master bedroom. Shit. Get out of there. - Hello, sir. - What are you doing? Well... I was looking for the bathroom and ended up in here. He wasn't caught. You have so many books that I want to read. Then you should read them. You must read books that you want to read. GIFT Here. Since I know the title now, I'll buy it for myself. Why buy it when I have it? No, it's okay. I feel bad. It's okay. Stealing a book is not stealing. I'll buy it myself. I promise. Let's go. There's a really good poem in here, that's why. Where was it again? Sir! I... will read it for sure. Okay. My cassette player broke. It won't make a sound. Could you take a look? I'm sure you can easily fix it. What was Mr. Yoo's major? Vietnamese. NAMI GREATEST HITS Sorry. I shouldn't have asked you to fix that. I took up all of your time. I can fix American products well, but I don't know the domestic products very well. It's fine. I'll call someone to come and repair it. Here, have some. Gosh. My gosh. The Nami tape. I can't even buy this anymore. - You should've removed it first. - I-I'm sorry. It's okay. - I'm home. - Hi. Hi, Ye-jun. You know Ye-jun's name, too? Well... So... Mister. Are you sure that wasn't my dad's voice earlier? My man. What's wrong? What is it? Cough! - Cough! - What's wrong? He's been caught! - He was caught for sure! - What? Who? What? Is something caught in his throat or were we caught? Get up. Come on. One, two, three. Again. One, two, three. Don't laugh. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - It's okay. - Thank you. Sir. I'm really okay. I told you. It's okay. I'm really okay. I'm allergic to needles. - Don't move. - That stings. Look at that black blood. You have indigestion. See? What did I say? I said it would make it go down in one go. Give me your foot, too. Look at that. I don't think you need to prick my toes. I think I'm good now. Good. Now, to finish off... Okay. I'm good. Actually, to be honest, I have a favor to ask. Sure. Go ahead. If you have time someday, would you take Ye-jun to a bathhouse? M-Me? As you know, I'm trapped at home. I can't even scrub my son's back. I'm probably asking too much. Okay, straighten your back. Okay. SEONGBUK POWER NAMPA SPY That's good. You're doing great. Are you sure you won't get in trouble? Yes, it's fine. I transport electronics in my trunk all the time, so they don't even check. Still, I feel bad. I took so much of your time. - Let's hurry home. Let's go. - No. No, sir. It's fine. You can take your time. - Then let's stay a little longer. - Okay. Ye-jun, I'm coming to get you. PUBLIC BATHHOUSE CLOSED FOR REPAIRS - What? - Underwear. Who cares about underwear? Hurry. Let's find the source of the crinkling. Snap out of it. That annoying prick. There's nothing here. Let's go. It's the housekeeper. Hurry. Of all things, how could you forget the list? You dimwit. Onions, green onions, stockings. What's this? Did I leave the window open? Where is my head? Oh my gosh. What was that? Why is this here? Do we have rats? That startled me. What's wrong with this? Is it closed now? Why is Mr. Lee so quiet? Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee? I'm sure he was here. Is he in the room? He must be in the bathroom. Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee. I'll be back soon. Oh my gosh. So this is where you were? I just checked... Should I bring you a snack? You should sleep in your room. Mr. Lee? Mr. Lee. There... Mr. Lee? Have you eaten? My gosh. You just ate. How are you hungry already? Oh my gosh. I almost peed my pants. I'll cook something up as soon as I get back. Wait a little bit. My gosh. You crazy bitch. What were you thinking? Okay, the skin should be soft. I'll scrub your back. Let's go. No, sir. It's okay. Who will scrub my back then? Come with me. - No, I'm good. - Come on. I... Why are you doing this? Do you know why I like bathhouses? Because in here, no one is successful or a loser. When you're naked, whether you're from Gyeongsang-do or Jeolla-do, the major party or the opposition, none of those outward things matter. That's why I like it. Dad, I want banana milk! Banana milk? BATHROOM Does milk upset your stomach, too? My lower belly hurts. I live next to the toilet. And yet, you want to drink milk? A few years ago, farmers were committing suicide because milk wasn't selling. That's when I started drinking milk. If I drink it, my colleagues will drink it. If they drink it, the entire nation will drink it. Then the farmers will live well. If our farmers live well, our nation will live well. Don't you agree, comrade? Comrade? We're neighbors. And diarrhea comrades. Tae! Kwon! Do! Hand! Good job. You're good. What did you two do today? Your skin is glowing as if you went to the bathhouse. A bathhouse? Don't be ridiculous. Hi, it's me. Did you eat? So... Have you eaten? What's gotten into you? You actually care whether your wife ate. That's not true. I always ask. No, you don't. This is the first time. Really? Maybe... you're right. What about Min-seong? He's obviously in dreamland at this hour. Does he still want to take Taekwondo? He must've given up. He doesn't mention it anymore. Send him. Send him, and... And if we can't afford it, I'll borrow money so he can go. Let's let him do everything he wants. Everything. What's gotten into you? Is something wrong? No, nothing's wrong. Hey, calling long-distance is expensive so I'm hanging up. Wait. Honey. What? Do you want to say something? - Well... - What is it? Your brother hasn't come home in a few days. He hasn't? AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY PLANNING RESTRICTED He fled after the protest in Sinchon last time, and was arrested yesterday. I thought he looked familiar. Dae-gwon. Dae-gwon! Dae-gwon! You fucking commie. So he really is your brother. You're both done for. Sir. I'm sorry, sir. I... I raised my brother wrong. Please forgive me. I swear, I'll give you my allegiance. Shut the fuck up. Sir. I'm begging you. Please forgive me. I swear I'll do anything you say. I'll even die if you say so. I'll die, sir. I will. I've done everything you've said. I even fabricated evidence because you told me to. You little... Hey. I may always be in the office but I'm not stupid, you little shit. I sent you to monitor the commie, but you go to the bathhouse with him? What were you trying to do by sneaking him out, asshole? It was a plan, sir. It was a plan. We made a plan to lock Lee Ui-sik up. What was that, asshole? You can see for yourself! What brings you here? Aren't you going to the US? I can't even leave home. How could I go to the US? I haven't seen you since you were a little girl. Now that I look at you, you're a grown woman. You're monitoring us day and night. Are you going to school? You shut down the schools for two months. Dong-hyeok, did I do that? You did not. I'm home. What happened to your eye? Ye-jun, did you get in a fight? - No. - Yes, you did. Tell us. Ji-hyeok said Dad was a commie! Ji-hyeok? Want me to scold him? Do you know Ji-hyeok? I do. He sits behind you in class. You sit next to Yeong-min. Are you monitoring elementary school kids now, too? I'm not monitoring some little kids. - I just get the reports. - Hey. Are there no human rights or freedom in Korea? There are. Except for commies like your dad. Why is our dad a commie? Eun-jin. Do commies not teach their kids manners? That's enough. What is your definition of a commie? An asshole who is different from me. Got that? Mr. Kim. Let me ask you one thing. What is that patriotism that you always talk about? You don't know what patriotism is. Dong-hyeok, what is patriotism? Well, how could you express love with words? You can't express it with words, so you express it with action. Meeting heads of large corporations and extorting them, getting your brother to bribe prosecutors and cops, manipulating the media and stealing from citizens. Is that your patriotism? I'm speechless. I won't complain since it's just you running your mouth. But get a clue first before you open that mouth of yours. We received a tip that you're communicating with North Korea. - Dong-hyeok, start searching. - Hey, begin the search. Yes, sir. What do you think you're doing? There's nothing here. - Check the room. - That's the kids' room. Is it? Turn everything upside down. - I said it's my kids' room! - What are you doing? Hey! Stop it! What are you doing? Why are you doing this? This is my daughter's... Get out now! Hey. Check under the bed. - Right there. - It's not here. Look here. What's this now? Damn it. Sir. There's something here. What is it? What is it? NATIONAL COLLEGE STUDENTS ALLIANCE Are you an activist? Lee Eun-jin. You're a leader. - Eun-jin. - What is this about? What is wrong with you people? No, right? It's true. You called innocent students commies and locked them up in holding cells. Your beatings left permanent physical damage and then you threw them out on the street. That's why the students take to the streets instead of school. Stop it. You become a criminal even if you do nothing wrong. But we need to speak! We need to be heard! - Stop it. - Fine. I'll listen. Say everything you want to the interrogator. Say it all. Gosh. Take her in. No. No, you can't. - No. Eun-jin. - Let go of me! - Eun-jin! - You're all commies. - Let go! - What's with all that red? Let me go! Seriously. Damn it. Mr. Kim. - Let Eun-jin go. - Why? I'll take all the responsibility, so let her go. You won't run for president, right? And you'll go to the US? You'll go to the US, okay? Let her go. Hey. Who told him about the stuff I did? I think that dragonfish behind us told him those baseless rumors. That dragonfish asshole. Why don't we get some spicy fish stew? Yes, sir. What was that? What happened here? Kkeut-sun made a delicious beef and radish soup. Have lunch and go. What happened? Was it those bastards who just left? What are you so curious about? It's just a family matter. Please leave. Ui-sik, why are you being so weak? You must become stronger in times like this. We're done preparing for your run for presidency. Just trust me, and go to the press conference... Just because I'm locked up, are you looking down on me? You have no right to order me around! - That is not what I meant. - I make the decisions. Me. All you have to do is follow them. Ui-sik! I was afraid I'd make my wife, who supported me all her life, a widow, and my kids fatherless. So I couldn't sleep at all in prison. When my kids fought for their lives from carbon monoxide poisoning, I thought maybe it was over. It terrified me to no end. I can't even protect my family. My hands are tied, and I can't do anything. How can I protect the nation? What makes me so special? Why am I so special? Fine. Then get out of here. Get as far away from here. Don't come anywhere near my house again. The announcement of your candidacy for presidency... I don't need these things anymore, so don't ever... ever write something like this again. Look it over and call me. Take care of yourself. Please. That was a strange conversation. The dragonfish is leaving. Cook up the spicy fish stew well. Indian Trading Company, New York office. Pardon? Captain. What? Honey. Do you remember? You turned down the Military Academy and said you'd make money, and pushed wheelbarrows instead of studying. You were stupid nice back then. But now, you're actually stupid. Please open your eyes. Hello. Why are the cops outside? Min No-guk committed suicide. What? ASSEMBLYMAN MIN NO-GUK COMMITS SUICIDE BY CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING Did Min No-guk really commit suicide? We can't let you go just because you do this. I never asked you to let me go. I'm just saying farewell to my friend from the closest place to him I can get. Ui-sik. It's me, No-guk. I'm sure it'll be hard, but practice again and again. Don't think the words in red are tacky, and just repeat after me. He wrote it nice and big so that it's easy to read. Confront your fears, Ui-sik. You've walked down a difficult path. It must have been so lonely. My poor friend. Hey, you. Are you listening? I am very lonely right now. So just for the day, will you lend me your ear? He said again and again that he missed our hometown, but I let him go without taking him back once. How could I ever go there now? I have no right. When I was in prison, he nursed my father through his illness, and served as head mourner when he passed away. I... I can't face my father. I've received all my life. I didn't give him anything. I'm sorry, my friend. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. No-guk. At noon tomorrow, I will attend Min No-guk's funeral. And there, I will announce my candidacy for president. This is something Min No-guk and I planned for a long time. It won't be easy to get out of here. How do you plan to get out? I think you should stay home, and not go anywhere. It can't get any worse than it is now. - Dad. - Hey. Come in. I'm sorry. For what? I feel like I made it harder for you. This feels good. My daughter is actually worried about me. You have to go tomorrow, right? I'm just... It's right that you go. But strangely, being with you like this right now... makes me so happy. We'll stop him a little tomorrow, and let him go. Then the operatives will smash his car. Stay close behind. May I bum a smoke? Have you eaten? Yes, I have. What about you? Yes, me too. Actually, to be honest, I don't smoke. I just wanted to be your friend. Pardon? I just needed a friend. My friend. You know who I am, don't you? How would I, my man? You know who I am. Why would you ask something like that? I'll tell you everything. I'm actually... You're my comrade. My neighborhood comrade. Sir. We don't have much time. You'll be in danger if you go out tomorrow. You have your job, and I have mine. We should each devote ourselves to our respective jobs. Sir. I don't know when it will be, but let's eat together sometime. SEOUL N3960 Excuse me. Pretend to stop him, and then let them through. Yes, sir. Thank you very much for having faith in this humble man and coming all this way. I promise to create history with you. One which we will not regret. Let us all leave together now to see our eternal friend, comrade Min No-guk. Dae-gwon. Stay close and don't get made. Report which road they take, and then drop back. The operatives will handle the rest. Move. What are you doing? Move! Move! - Move! Let go! - No! - Let him go! - Let go! Shit! Damn it! We can arrest Lee Ui-sik once he steps outside. Why do they keep telling you to follow him? Is that what you think, too? You, too? The HQ bastards want to snatch him away! We did all the work. We should arrest him! Right? That commie asshole. We should arrest his ass. Right? Yes! Let's do it then! Okay! Stop the target at all costs. Don't let him get out. The moment he gets into a car, you must arrest him. Yes, sir. Why do they keep changing their mind? They say to stop him. - Stop him! - Move! - Don't let him through! - Move! - Push him back in! - Get inside! - Move! - Go! Stop it! Let go of him! Stop it! Don't let him out! Push him back in! You have to go tomorrow, right? I've received too much from other people. - Move! - Dad! - No! - Eun-jin! - No! No, Eun-jin! - Eun-jin! No. Oh my gosh. No. - Move! - What happened? - She's hurt. Move! - Move! Move! Move! - Don't you dare touch my daughter! - Move! Wait. Let him through. Captain! Go ahead. I'll be right behind you. Please hurry. Hang on. - There's a hospital... - No, Dad. I'm fine. It's just a flesh wound. It's nothing compared to the torture you suffered. You scared me. How could you do that? Because you have to go. Because that's right. Dae-gwon, where are you? Where are you? Where are you, punk? He's heading to Samsongyo Intersection. - Got it. - Dad, I'll wait at the school. Mister, please pull over so I can get out. Target sighted. License plate 3960. - Where are you? - By New York Bakery at the threeway. Run him over. Dong-hyeok. That's not the car. Eun-jin... car... - That punk. - The... car... Black sedan. License plate Seoul N3960. Proceeding. Dong-hyeok! SEOUL N3960 Black sedan. License plate Seoul N3960. Approaching. Dong-hyeok. Eun-jin is in that car. It isn't Lee Ui-sik. Dong-hyeok! Stop! Stop! Stop the car! Dong-hyeok, how did it go? The situation has been handled. Good! You're a patriot! Yes! Eun-jin. Eun-jin. The star did not fall. He has died to become a new light and shine on the path for us to take. Amen. Amen. Mister. My dad got there okay, right? Yes, he did. Don't worry. Don't worry, Eun-jin. It's a TA patient! Call a surgeon now! - Set up an OR! - Yes, doctor. - Prepare a defibrillator! - Yes, doctor! Next, Chairman Lee Ui-sik will deliver the eulogy. UI-SIK, IT'S ME, NO-GUK. Today is a truly happy day. Because it is the day when democracy will bloom anew. Clear! Because my eternal friend, my eternal comrade, Min No-guk, who always smiled and asked me to create a good world to live in, planted the seeds of democracy. I am pleased. I am happy. That is why I am crying. I, Lee Ui-sik, will keep my promise to Min No-guk. For the democracy of Korea, I will keep my promise to all of you! - One, two, shoot. - Eun-jin! - Eun-jin! - Please stop. - Eun-jin! - You can't go in there! No! Eun-jin! A world in which no one dies an unfair death. Eun-jin! No! A world in which people high up aren't arrogant. President Shin Chung-nam! Cheers! A world in which all authority resides in each and every citizen. That is the world... I will create with all of you. EMERGENCY ROOM Let's go home, Eun-jin. Let's go... Doctor. My baby, Eun-jin... Get up. Let's go home. There's so much that I couldn't do for you. Lee Ui-sik. You are under arrest for conspiracy of treason. What the hell? You should've checked the face. - I'm sorry. - Eun-jin. - Honey. - Eun-jin. - Eun-jin. - Honey. - Eun-jin. - Honey. 2 MONTHS LATER Can't you let us see it just once? My gosh. There's a cold wave today. - The animals will freeze. - Honey. Min-seong's cold. Let's just go. Why would a Siberian tiger freeze in this weather? - What the... - Come on. Let us see it just once.
