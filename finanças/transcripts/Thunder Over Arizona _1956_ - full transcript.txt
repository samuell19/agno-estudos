"Thunder Over Arizona 1956" Tombstone, Arizona, founded in 1879 as a silver monument, baptized by an astute man who saw in his deadly lawlessness an open invitation to the cemetery. Located in Cochise County, former land of the Apaches. How many cards will you want? Five? One. I want three. Want to pass? I bet $ 100. I will win, sheriff. At my age, I can risk losing. Because I own the vein, do not forget it. And don't let your boss, Mayor Plummer, forget it too. Right. Let's see what you got. Three of a kind. Kings court. Four beautiful kings. You took one of those kings from the bottom. Are you sure what you're saying, sheriff? It is better to have. Why didn't I like that. He tried to serve against me. It looks like the sheriff got results. Let's check with him before we go to the mine. Hey, Mark. They look like shots. We'd better get our rifles. Those sheriffs must be tired of living. - Where is Daddy? - Sheriff Hudson killed him. Dad didn't stand a chance against that professional gunslinger. When he saw me, he started shooting too. - But I went faster. - Did you kill him? Yes. Take him inside, sister. I'll let them know that I want to talk. If one of them appears, kill it. The boy is hurt. We can get Mark and Jud. They can't take it alone. We want Tab Warren for the murder of Sheriff John Hudson! Come and get him! And now? Plummer won't be happy about that. Forget the Plummer. I intend to stay alive. We need a possession for that. Let's go back to the city. They don't seem to want it that much. I'll be watching, though. - Then? Where's the boy? - In the mine. You know the Warren brothers, they are great snipers. - Where are your horses? - They ran away. The shooting scared them. How it scared you. They're going to arrest that boy. He is wanted for murder. He will not be wanted for killing me, Mr. Plummer. - Let's talk to them anyway. - What good will that do? We will officially notify them that they are obstructing justice - when housing a criminal. - That makes sense. Mr. Plummer, can you lend us a horse to get ours? It won't be long. Come on. It will do them good. It seems to be the mayor and his friend. We're here on business. We want to talk to you. Don't dismount, and get out of here. - I'll talk to them. - Wait a minute, Fay. You shoot better than me. Cover me. Look! MS. Warren, I'm sorry about your father... You are not deceiving me. Not to my brothers. Tab told me what happened. It was a fair duel between him and your killer. Tab was faster, that's all. - Where's my father's body? - He's with the undertaker. Tell the undertaker that I will be in town in the morning. MS. Warren... do you realize that you are committing a crime by protecting your brother? Two of the best snipers in Cochise County, are aiming at your heads right now. So you better leave while you can. The Warren girl is outside. Mr. Warren's personal belongings. If you can check before you leave. Your watch. Wedding ring. $ 17. A tax bill, miss. Very expensive. $ 52.OOO? Are you sure this was found in your body? I took it out of your coat pocket myself, lady. I bet you didn't find what he won in poker. No, ma'am. I didn't think so. Have a nice day. Want to send flowers? I will speak to the undertaker. Remind him that his memory needs to fail. It won't be necessary. He's been the city's gravedigger for a long time. Hey, Byron... - Everything worked? - It was perfect. Did she say anything about the bill? I wanted to know if I had found it in the body and I said yes. Great. Now, it never happened. What never happened? I don't even know what you're talking about. That's right. You don't know, do you? Hey, Slats. Smoke it. It will save you a lot of time. No, I got sick with those Mexican cigars as a kid. I stole some from Grandma. Hey, Mr. Stiles, I've been thinking about the position of sheriff. - Is the vacancy open? - Mr. Plummer will appoint Rand. Well, everything worked out. The girl received the tax bill. Ten days from now there will be an auction due to non-payment. We will buy the mine. - Simple as that, huh? - Why not? We had work to kill Pliny and plant that account on him. What happened when we went to arrest Tab? How do you expect to take their mine, with or without taxes? We can gather a great possession. There aren't enough men around here who don't hate us. Calm down, Stiles. Cool. Maybe that will help. See what came out in the city newspaper. - What's interesting? - Read this. "Harvard Kelly, known at Fort Dodge and Abilene as Shotgun, just got to Carson City. He was hired as a guard for the Expresso railroad. " I don't know Shotgun Kelly. But I heard a lot about him the last time I went east in Kansas. He's not afraid of anything. Not even from the Warren brothers. Railroad guard. You look like a man of the law. He's a business man. It works for those who pay more. I heard about him. He works with a shotgun. If he accepts your offer, do you intend to make him sheriff? - I thought Rand... - I'll explain to you another time. Maybe we should send him a telegram. I already did. He'll be here soon. Six. Eight. I play again. I think that’s why I’m so unlucky in love. And in the game, as in love, I always stay in the tie. I will work now. Nine. Great hot coffee. Offered by the due diligence line. This one I did yesterday Fresh as cactus water. Five. This one will win you easy. Three. If the data were not mine, I would say they are addicted. I've never seen such bad luck, Mr. Kelly. Yes, I'm finished. I lost everything. Forget it. Next time, you will win against everyone. Use this to drink on my own. Do you like a shotgun? Yes I like. Load salt mints and you can't go wrong. No mistake. And I use lead. I'm going to sleep outside tonight, Pancho. You don't have to, Mr. Kelly. I'll start early. I think it's best to choose a room and lock the door, Mr. Tim. Why? Are there ghosts around here? Yes, and worse. Mr. Shotgun Kelly. I never heard of him. He has 12 marks on his shotgun. He killed 12 men. You need to be careful or it will be the 13th. You just earned your money and he was not happy about it. - Nobody forced him to bet. - That's what makes him feel worse. Kelly said what were you doing around here? No, he didn't say much. But he is going west. Are you sure you don't want that room? I didn't like this guy's face. He's not exactly handsome. Good night, Pancho. For the part of the money you earned, I can stay here watching, with open eyes. It's fine by me. For the $ 10 I offered Kelly. What are you going to do, sir? Panning, maybe? Perhaps. Most people come here because of gold or silver. - Do you know how to pan? - Yes, but I'm afraid little. Maybe you know more about cows? Perhaps. You need to be careful in Tombstone. This is a very dangerous place. You can die easily. In the saloon, there are men who want to duel, they want to kill, just for fun. I'll be careful, Pancho. Thanks for the tortillas. - They did. - You bet. My tortillas fill anything. Mr. Kelly is still sleeping. He wanted to start early, maybe it is better to wake him up. The less I mess with Mr. Kelly, the better. Goodbye, Pancho. Maybe I'll come back one day. Goodbye, sir. You will never forget Pancho's tortillas. Not for a few days. Mr. Tim, I told you so! I warned you! I bet he tried to ambush you. He was not trying to hit a bird in the sky. - This is for hunting buffalo. - Yes may be. Take it. Keep it. You may need it in Tombstone. It's all right. I had to sell my rifle in Tucson. I think I can get used to it. Ask them to dig a grave for him. Yes sir. You better stay with his horse and saddle, Pancho. This is generous of you, Mr. Tim. Those idiots are drunk again. They must be warming up for Independence Day. - I'll be the sheriff. - Yes, Slats. Where's the sheriff? Come on, Slats. Keep those weapons! I told you not to carry a gun when you're drinking. Sorry, Mr. Plummer. I won't let it happen again. No more drinking today for you. Where's Chalky? - He's eating. - You better do the same. Wait. Slats, he can't stand to see us having fun. Pie, guys? Pie for sale. How about a nice piece of pie? I made it myself. Do you want pie, stranger? - Hey, Chalky. - Chalky! Well, Miss. Warren, there's one left. What do you think about taking it to your brother? What do you think of a can of beans? Hey, Chalky! Hey, Chalky! What's going on now? A Warren is making trouble for the boys again. - Are you Shotgun Kelly? - Collect the lady's purchases. Mind if I walk you home? I don't think it will be necessary, Mr. Kelly. But I'm not... I'll pick him up. Kelly? Shotgun? - When did you arrive? - Now. - Do you have a room? - Have. My name is Stiles. Come and meet Mayor Plummer. After you, Shotgun. Welcome to Tombstone, Shotgun. Well well! Sit down. - Good trip? - More or less. I'm Mayor Plummer. I think Stiles told you. Said. I saw what happened to those men. No wonder they call you Shotgun. Do you know the girl? She is one of the reasons for being here. Interesting. Do you know the heroes who were bothering her? My sheriff Rand and his helpers. Another reason to be here. Any other reason? Well, there is the money you will earn. Yes, how about an advance, Kelly? $ 500? How about telling me the rest first? Well, Kelly, a few days ago, a man named Pliny Warren tried to kill the old sheriff. Well, the sheriff got it faster. But Pliny's son murdered the sheriff. Rand was appointed to replace him. Stop rolling. Why did you offer me so much money? - Because? - Rand and his men, they can't do what I want. Randall will wear the badge, but you will be in charge. Here is a copy of the Wagon Car mine tax bill. Operated by Warren's three children. The girl you just saved is their sister. $ 52.OOO? That's quite an account. What does this have to do with me? What will I command? - I'll get there. - Plummer! Let me say something. Can you excuse us for a moment? I know what I am doing. Here's the situation, Kelly... The Warren were unable to grow the property enough, to realize what they have. Now, when the payment deadline is over, I may be able to buy the mine at a public auction. But the Warrens are brave and murderous. - Evicting them won't be easy. - I understand. Of course, it will involve weapons. I don't want my administration involved. That is, directly. When it's all over, you can leave the city. - And the girl? - You met her. Maybe you have some ideas about it. - The money is good. - Great. I want to take a shower and buy new clothes. You can take a hot shower at the barbershop. The clothing store is at the end of the street. You can eat and drink for free anywhere in Tombstone. - I'll let everyone know. - You know, we rule this way. With your help. I've had more interesting conversations. I liked him. He is silent. Hope so. Good afternoon, Mr. Kelly. Do you want your horse? Only three days from now. He is tired. Is there any for me to take a walk? I want to get some fresh air. Of course. In between. It's nice to meet someone who knows horses. Most of the guys around here treat them like machines. Without giving rest. I have a good one here, Mr. Kelly. - I always keep one sealed. - How do you know my name? These things travel fast in Tombstone. Many people have heard of you. - What did you hear? - The expected about you. - Will you stay in Tombstone? - That depends. Do you know the Warrens? - Yes, I know them. - How do I get to their mine? Mr. Kelly, you know how to treat a horse, so I like you. Why don't you leave the city? Why is my horse tired. You will find the right path to the mine, three miles to the west. Thanks. This is the back entrance, Mr. Kelly, there will be no problem. WARREN'S MINE Stopped! - It's lost? - Is this the Warrens' mine? That's right. So I'm not lost. I have something to tell you. The conversation ended. Turn around and get out of here. - Look, this is important to you. - Not as much as what I said. A trick. What's up, Fay? He is fine. - Just hit his head. - Do you know him? Do not. Let's get him inside. Do you know this man, Fay? Slats Callahan called him Shotgun Kelly. He didn't deny it. I told you about him. - Is he badly hurt? - Just passed out. Okay, Kelly. Can you walk? - I think so. - There's the door. Start walking. Look, I just came to ask a few questions. You have already received the answers. Get out of here! Wait a minute. Let him speak. I'll get something for your head. Give me your belt. There are only two things. - Is it him they're after? - Yes. - What's wrong with him? - He was shot in the leg. The bullet is still inside. Didn't you call a doctor for him? Dr. Petterson has been gone all week. He'll be back tomorrow. On here. Sit down. Plummer said his mine owes $ 52,000. And you will not pay. It is the first time in life that it hits. That account is fake. Dad never talked about her. they said they found it in his body, and delivered it to me before the funeral. Plummer tried to buy the mine. My father did not sell. Then they killed him to plant the bill. Now they will try to sell the mine for failure to pay taxes. Why does Plummer want your mine so badly? Why our came through his property. There is an old law that states that the shaft is controlled by the property where the vein originates, no matter where it goes. I remember that law. Plummer said you shot his sheriff. - That's right. - In self-defense. Sheriff Hudson was a professional gunslinger. Why make a fort in this place? Take this fight to court. The Plummer court? With the Plummer judge? You haven't been here in a long time, Kelly. We've already wasted enough time with you. Go away and don't come back. I will take the gun. Thanks. Good... Can I talk to you outside, Mr. Kelly? Of course. Don't forget your hat. This shot of Shotgun Kelly doesn't look like you. Where did you get that? My father received the Kansas City newspapers by mail. There is not likely to be another copy in Tombstone. This one is three months old. Do your brothers know about this? No, because I wasn’t sure until I saw him again. I remembered seeing this photo in my dad's cabin. But I knew it wasn't him. Well, I use a shotgun very well. Yes, but the real Mr. Kelly. would have fun seeing me being attacked. I would like to thank you for helping me. I should thank the guys for the opportunity. You still haven't told me what it's called. - Jim Malloy. - Jim Malloy? It is a beautiful name. Anything else? Maybe later. - What will you do now? - Stay here for a few days. I will act like Kelly until I find out a few things. So, I'll be back. Here comes your brother. What were they talking about? You're welcome. I was just thanking him for helping me around town. It's good not to be too interested. He's a stranger. - And works for Plummer. - Who said I'm interested? You don't have to be nervous, Fay. Mark just wants you to be careful. Do not worry. I'll be careful. - How was it, Mr. Kelly? - Good. Pancho! - Good night, sir. - Do you remember me? Yes maybe. Do you remember Shotgun Kelly and what happened to him? Shotgun Kelly... Listen, did you talk about it with someone in the saloon? - I buried Mr. Kelly for $ 10. - I know that, Pancho. But did you talk about it with anyone in Tombstone? Pancho had fun in Tombstone. I... am very drunk. Pancho, how about a hot coffee? It will make you feel good. Pancho, hot coffee will make you feel better. Pancho feels good. Huh, Pancho? Saw? I feel good. Listen to me. Did you tell anyone about Shotgun Kelly? I didn't like Mr. Kelly. He was not friendly. Bum... bum. You are good. Pancho is happy. Pancho, wait a minute. Hello, Shotgun. Having problems? He's just celebrating. - He's doing it. - Plummer wants to talk to you. He's in there. Thank you, Mr. Stiles. See you later. - Good afternoon, Shotgun. - Hi. - What are you going to drink? - Whiskey. A whiskey. I want you to meet Mel Hogan. He represents Cia. Do Expresso in Tombstone. I found Gutierrez outside. He was very drunk. - He works for you, doesn't he? - Yes, run the Mescall station. Stiles said he was looking for me. That's right. Mr. Hogan's Express Company, will send a shipment of gold in my due diligence. Jonas, the regular guard, is sick. With a lot of fever. What do you think to do security? It's okay with me, Mr. Plummer. Well, that makes me more carefree. - She leaves tomorrow at seven. - I will be there. Can we do something to make you happy? You don't have to, Mr. Plummer. It's all right. See you in the morning. You know, boss, he seems to be a brave man. Not so much. - Dr. Petterson? - That's right. - You must be Shotgun Kelly. - That's right. I have a cut on my head. Perhaps it is better to take a look. It was out, huh? Yes, for a week in Tucson. I came back last night. It must have been quite a blow. Follow me. I'll clean it for you. Stay there. These injuries can cause a problem. I heard about Sheriff Hudson's death. It is a pity. Those Warrens are hot headed. Tab Warren is injured. The bullet is still in your leg. Perhaps it is good to go there to help you. He need help. It is best to rest for a few days if you don't want to have a headache. I can not. Mayor Plummer wants me to do it, due diligence security. - The regular guard is sick. - Is Jonas sick? Funny. When I passed his house, he was chopping wood. Are you sure about that? No, I don't think it was Jonas. Maybe someone like him. It was early and the canyon was filled with fog. I will not put a bandage on. Wear your hat and don't let dust fall there. - Show up tomorrow. - How much do I owe you, doctor? Nothing. This is one of the rules of Plummer. - Good morning, Shotgun. - Good morning, mayor. Meet Clel. He's the driver. - No passengers, huh? - Only the gold. There may be problems for that. I thank you, Shotgun. I know you weren't hired as a guard. - How's Jonas doing this morning? - He told me he's still sick. Well, it's time to go. Let's go. Watch out for the Indians! - It's all right? - For sure. - Are ready? - I bought a new rifle. Don't be afraid to use it. Now, get out of here. You will have time. I told Clel to go slow. - What about the vault? - Break it in and take the gold. You need to make it look like a real rip off. And don't forget the main objective. Do you think he's a lawman? I wish that Mexican could remember his name. Maybe he's some smart guy trying to trick us. We will never know. Why did you leave the main road? I took a shortcut. I'll see if they're coming. Wasn't that Rand's pintold? I didn't see any horses. - They're coming. - Are you sure they didn't see you? Even though he saw it, I'm too far away for him to recognize me. Not this horse of yours. I would recognize your horse before I recognized you. Shut up and let's get ready. Stop and go back to the main road. I told you to stop. There is no one on the stage. - The vault is not here. - Let's go back to look for her. That man must have gone back to the road. - What happened to you? - He knocked me off the stage. - Where's the gold? - In due diligence. - It is not there. - Forget it. - Where is that man? - At the top of the hill. Whoever sees him first... Hey, look! Isn't this where we left the stage? - Well, he did it. - Plummer won't be happy. Well... Mr. Kelly. Hey, is there something wrong? Your driver tried to take us into an ambush. Clel? I do not believe. He left the main road where three gunmen, were waiting for us. Maybe that will convince you. - They didn't even come close to gold. - That's quite a shock. - Where's Clel? - It must be around. I want to thank you for that, Shotgun. I'm going to the barn to try to get another driver. I'll be at the restaurant. - He didn't want to go to the mine, huh? - He said he didn't have time. He is terrified of Plummer. I didn't even want to do that. But I had to bring Tab. Jud and Mark feared it was going to gangrene. - Are they watching the mine? - That's right. - Do you think it will take? - I think he's running out. - Where did you get in? - I brought Tab down the alley. - Do you think anyone saw you? - I think not. And with you? There's something wrong? I'm not sure, but I think they found out. If they found out, they are pretending they don't know. You shouldn't take any chances. You don't know Plummer. You are right. I will go to the mine later. Tell your brothers that I'm going, because I don't want to be shot again. Now, get him out of here. Quickly! Are you sure you didn't say something suspicious? I didn't open my mouth. He saw Rand's pintold, and tried to get me back on the road. How would I know that he would recognize my horse? Hello. Did you call Plummer? Of course I called. What's the matter with you? Do you work for Plummer or not? Get out of there. Leave the. Get it now. Now, Miss. Warren, get out of here! Before I change my mind and arrest you too. - Shotgun, what are you doing here? - The assault. I'm not sure, but I think the driver was part of the theft. Why do you think that? I suspected when he took a different trail. I tried to stop him, we fought and knocked him out of the stage. Finally, I came back with the gold. Good boy. Great job. We finally got Warren. I'm going to wire right now asking you to prepare the trial. Came to you later. Congratulations again. Don't let it out of your sight. Stick around. If we give him a chance, he might be able to get away with Warren. Here it is. Free hosting. You won't have to worry about this leg for long. Did something happen on the trip, Shotgun? I saw you leaving the office. A little problem. It's not even worth mentioning. Was the stage stolen? I think you can call it that. Three amateur children tried to ambush me. They must never have shot, because they didn't hit anything. - Where's Clel? - I have no idea. I think he was part of the gang. You will not believe this, but I have never seen so much stupidity in my life. Instead of taking the stage, they went back to pick up Clel. I just got off the mountain, got on the stage and left. And these idiots walked up the hill to look for me. Wow, I wanted to see the look on their faces when they saw that I tricked them and I went back to Tombstone. Well, I say we're fine. The stage returned safely, along with our trusted gunman and Warren is in jail. But I want to know what this has to do with the mine! That's one of the things I like about you, Stiles. Your logical mind. You should try to use it more. - Listen to me, Plummer... - Why would I do that? Hey, Clel? Yes, Mr. Plummer? Take a light cart, fill it with straw and bring it back. - Let me know when you're ready. - Yes sir. - Buying a cow? - No, a mine. Now, lock the chain and bring everyone here. Try your best not to raise suspicion. You're the boss. I learned something early in life. Whatever happens to you, good or bad, use it. Good advice, Mr. Plummer. Very good advice. The best. What do you ask? - Open it now, Chaldy. - Three. Three? - Is everything okay here? - No problem, Mr. Stiles. Mr. Plummer wants to see you all in his office. You can finish the game later. - And the prisoner? - We will only take a few minutes. Well, we'll lock the front door. Plummer was happy with the way he handled things this morning. Thanks. I try to do the best I can. Right. What is your name? - Shotgun Kelly. - No longer. You killed Kelly at Mescall station. - He seems to me to be from the law. - We'll find out. Tie it up. When we're done, you'll want us to be amateurs. In half an hour, I want you to go to the back of the jail. Tell Tab Warren that his friends will rescue you from jail at 4 am. - In the afternoon? - Of course. It is the time that no one expects this to happen. But something else will happen that Tab Warren won't be expecting. Rand will be across the street when Tad Warren tries to escape. - Rand will use his rifle. - Of course. Everything within the law. I knew you would understand. Especially, if I explained. You can count on me, Mr. Plummer. - Slats. - Yes? Do you know that old cabin near Pipe Walsh? Yes, I was there last month. Take this man and leave him there for now. Not for... Maybe after. I think Slats is right. Why... Shut up, you two. Do as I say. - Everything is ready, Mr. Plummer. - Get him out of here. Everything is clean. Bring him. Slats, come here. Oh, Clel... Slats will go with you. He will tell you what to do. I heard that idiots are the happiest people in the world. You just proved it. Stiles, there are times when I find it hard to believe, that you are the best lawyer here. I'm good enough to keep you out of jail. But you have blind spots. You forget that there are people, who do not act according to their law books. - I didn't like that joke, Plummer. - Want a shot? Warrens, for example, are brave people. There is no way to scare them. They stay together. But there is one thing that can get you out of that fort on the hills. - What? - That boy in jail. Do you really think they will try to rescue him? If there's one thing I know, it's people. The Warrens will arrive around four o'clock. - But how will they know... - I once heard a pastor say: "Faith is the best thing in the world." Stiles, have faith in me and you'll see what I mean. Hey, Rand, I'm going to need three more men. Do you know who I can count on? I think so. After Slats returns, the three of you will be in town. Let's go. I'll show you. If you need anything, just call the butler. It's Kelly. What do you want, Kelly? - It's about your brother. Can you give me some water? Lets go in. - Did you know anything more about Tab? - Not yet. He's still under arrest, of course. First, I want to say something about myself. I'm not Shotgun Kelly. My name is Tim Malloy. That's true. Show him the newspaper. It's a long story. But let's talk about Tab. They will condemn you and hang you for murder. I'm not sure there will be a trial. I heard Plummer tell the station agent to warn Tab, that his friends were going to rescue him from jail this afternoon at four. Friends? He also said that one of his men would wait for Tab with a rifle. A false escape to cover up a murder. Wait a minute, Malloy. How did you hear that and how did you get here? After catching your brother, they trapped me. Tie me up and leave me in a hut, abandoned a mile from here. While they were doing that, I heard Plummer telling his plan. Why tie you up? Why didn't they kill you? They thought I would escape to warn you. They thought they would be in town at four, and leave the mine unprotected. Malloy is right. Plummer won. Anyway, they got us. Certainly. We have to go there to see if Tab will be smart enough, to see is a trap. We will have to go anyway. If he doesn't try to escape, they'll kill him anyway. And when we get out of here, they will come. He'll make that fake account count in court and we'll be finished. It is better to prepare the cart. We'll take the Tab and leave the territory. I'm glad Dad isn't alive to see this. It may not be so bad. I think I know a way to get them back to the mine. From the way they're traveling, they must be late. Weren't you the ones who passed the stage a little while ago? Of course it was, Plummer. Do you have any more silly questions? - Who robbed them? - Nobody assaulted us. Your new gunman said he would help us and that walking would do us good. Is your plan starting to backfire, Plummer? Nothing like that. What if they rescue the boy Warren? They still have to go back to the mine, don't they? Right. There is no one here. Take cover on those rocks. They must be coming soon. Hide the horses. There's no way to know if they rescued him. Why would they come back? They know you can't attack this place. Tab is in there. Plummer, can you hear me? What you want? We will give you two minutes to get out of there with your hands up. - We'll start counting now. - They must be drunk. I'll give you and your friends two hours to get out of this county. You better do what we say. They cannot understand. They must be crazy. You have 30 seconds, Plummer. You better get out of there. Look! Rand! That means they escaped with the boy. - He's one of the sheriffs. - Take care of him. Okay, Plummer. Five seconds. Stopped! Drop this weapon. I hope the wires work. How many did you plant? - Eight. - All are ready. Let's go. That Plummer. How smart he was. I didn't hear anyone. - Knows all. - Plummer is dead. Dead? That hardhead deserved it. I asked for it when I messed with him. - What about the mine tax bill? - Everything fake. You will find all the records in the Plummer vault. - What about my father's murder? - It's all part of the scheme. It was Plummer's idea. I was a fool. One thing, Malloy. Are you a man of the law? Just a cowboy. And gold digger. Okay, cowboy. You found what you wanted. Come back or I'll find your shotgun and I'll go after you. Why do you think I'm going with him? Speaking of a shotgun, give him one. It will not be necessary. WesternKasa / GM NOV2020 synchronization edition translation
