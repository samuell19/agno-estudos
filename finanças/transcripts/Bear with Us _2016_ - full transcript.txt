It's all part of the plan. - What about the raccoon? - Oh, that was all Harry's idea. Great work, by the way, with the whole roadkill thing. - Right. - I really wish I'd thought of that. - And the radio? - You'd be surprised how easy it is to reverse the transmission on a shortwave radio. - That's the dumbest fucking plan I've ever heard. - No, you don't even know the half of it. ♪ - The evidence is clear.

Now, what that means is that his mate is out there, and she is angry. Do you have any idea what a female bear will do to avenge a loved one? Well... I'll spare you the gory details, but I've seen firsthand what those five-inch claws can do. That hunter didn't last long when he small intestine was painting the ground a pretty shade of crimson, and all he could do was pick his own guts up in his hand and scream, "Why?"

We were waiting out there. - I'm, like, really sorry, but look, we should have done a dress rehearsal or something. - You know that we didn't have the time or the money for real rehearsals. - I couldn't get the costume on by myself, and then, when I did, I could hardly see out of it. - Man, I am tired of the excuses, all right? We have a real problem. - I know. - Yeah, the crazy woodsman. - The bear. - Wait, what? - There's a real bear out there, man. - What do you mean there's a real bear out there? - You know, "Roar, I'm gonna eat you"? That kind of a thing. - Really? - Yeah. - Uh, I think I read that bears are more afraid of us than we are of them. - Oh, I've not read that. - We will be fine. Well, I will be fine. Hudson has a real gun, and if he sees you dressed as a bear, he's gonna shoot you and mount your head on his wall. - I spent two days without him, and I knew that I had a task to accomplish, but I couldn't let my human emotions get in the way. - You're a really passionate guy, and I find that really attractive in a man. - Really? - What? - Could you just excuse us for one second? Come on. Sorry. - I don't mean to be the voice of reason here, but maybe we should call it quits. Look, I didn't sign up for a real bear. I didn't sign up for a real gun. Technically, I didn't sign anything, except for the receipt for the bear costume, which put me into overdraft, just so you know. - Whoa, what are you doing? Are you hitting on that guy? - What? No. He's just had a very interesting life. Besides, my therapist said that no feelings are bad feelings, except shoulder tension. - We are so close. I can't do this without you. - Why is it such a big deal to propose to her like this? - I don't know. I just want to give Quincy a reason to stay with me. - She has enough reason to be with you, all right? You love her like crazy. You're a handsome fellow. You've got a good job. - Had. - Oh. - I haven't told Quincy yet. Okay, okay.. I have a plan, all right? Now, you turn the radio on, and you make sure that Hudson is listening. ♪ - Where are the girls? - Uh, lady problems. - What does that even mean? Don't answer that. Let's take a break from all this craziness and go listen to the radio. - I love radios. - Yeah. Great. - I'd really appreciate it if you stopped hitting on Harry. You were supposed to be my friend on this trip. You remember that? - Look, I know that I just met Harry, but I think I really like him. And why can't you just be happy for me? - I would be happy for you if I thought that it was going to work. Look, Colin even said-- No, you know what? I shouldn't say anything. - Shouldn't say anything about what? - Colin said that Harry isn't interested in you. That you two are just not right for each other. Harry is a huge idiot, but at least he has standards. - What's that supposed to mean? - You know, I don't even-- I don't--I literally don't know anything. I haven't known a goddamn thing since we showed up to this place. Everyone's acting weird, you included, and now I just want some wine. Where'd Harry put that nasty attic wine? In the attic? Thank you. He probably just didn't want to hurt your feelings. This is an emergency alert from the Smithtown County area. Residents are advised to stay inside their homes. Emergency teams will be coming door to door delivering care packages filled with water, bear repellant, and D batteries. That is all. - What are you doing? - Uh-oh. - Uh, well, buddy, I guess you'd better get home so you can get your D batteries or whatever. - Too risky. Could be a trap. - A trap set by who? The bear? - That's the dumbest fucking plan I've ever heard. - You just have to promise not to let Colin know that you know. - Plus they're gonna be bringing a care package here, too, right? - Right. - So? - Oh, God damn it. - This is ridiculous. - He has worked so hard on this, Quincy. Please play along, for his sake. - Okay, just wait here. Just wait. - This is all for you! This whole weekend! All of it!

She doesn't know about the plan. She just wanted the nasty attic wine. - Hudson didn't go for it. - What? - It was a good try, but we're gonna have to find another way to distract him. - I'll distract him. - Great. How? - I'll show you what it looks like to lead someone on. I don't care if he can make sandwiches or not. I mean, he's really attractive, right? He's got a great body. That's always been enough in the past. - So what is your plan, exactly? - I said I would handle it, okay? Jesus! - Does Hudson really have that great of a body? - I'd say a seven. - A seven? - But I'm not really into flannel, so I might not be the best person to ask. We may have been interrupted, but nothing has changed. The bear is still out there, and we need to hurry, because if we lose the sun, the bear has the advantage. - Can bears see in the dark? - It's, like, midday. - Exactly. - Where are Tammy and Hudson? - I thought you said there were batteries in here.
