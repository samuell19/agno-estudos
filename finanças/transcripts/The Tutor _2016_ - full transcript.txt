I must seem cruel but since the death of my brother I haven't found the father in me. The kids are nice enough but I can't take time away from my patients. I do what I can from a distance. I've heard of the famous people who come to see you. I also read you work 'Vengeance v. Revenge' Truth is, it's a ...daring work. You like kids? Yes, of course. I mentioned it in my C.V. I have a degree in Child Psychology And I minored in Education. I studied with the American Deborah Foreman Some study viruses, but they don't live with them. Let's see, do you have any previous experience? Well, I was substitute in a Kindergarten... Actually, this would be my first post. Well, ok. It's not that important. One learns on the job. I hope you don't mind living in a such a remote place. Though the mansion is old, it has a large park, A beautiful swimming pool, grounds, river, forests... I hope to be able to live there myself one day. We don't require that much. Just so they can learn... to read and write. In general that they... They don't yet write? That's why we need your services. They've had some gaps in the education. They don't go to school. It's too far away. It'd be a waste of time, in any case. After the tragedy the two children found solace in themselves. This symbiosis between brothers is a common occurrence with children who face unmanageable traumas. They were never able to find a ...'closure', after the death of their parents. They are like two ...small animals who only have each other. I admit they are a bit peculiar. I hope they won't intimidate you. No, I don't think so. I'll be able to impose my authority and also be a friend to them. My parents only ever taught me good values, I don't have any bad ones to pass on. Do let me know which ones are the correct ones. When did your parents die? How did you know that? Sorry, works one day, not the other. Professional intuition. Of course, that's why they admire you so much. Well, a few months ago. I took care of them till the last, - You have brothers? - No. Yes, ...he died a long time ago. - How old were you? - Eleven years old. That's odd, it's the same age the girl is now. You were close with your brother? Yes. Well, I suppose like all brothers are. Between brothers we find from the deepest hatred to the very opposite. That's why you studied Child Psychology. Sad. Sad. I'm sorry. I don't think I'm right person for the job. No. On the contrary. I think your naïveté, will be helpful in this case. Clara will be assisting you. She also had a difficult life. She lost her husband, and later her son. She lived there for years, she has nothing else, poor lady. She has nothing else, poor soul. But please, avoid contacting me. I don't have the luxury of dedicating time to them. For this reason, you would be fully responsible for the children. Ema! Àngel! How was the trip, Mona? Good. The truth is, the countryside is beautiful. What do you think of the house? The house is ...beautiful. It's very big. And it appears to have lots of character. Yes, and it's very confortable. It has it's little problems But despite all, it's very confortable. Many famous people used to come here. Yes. Yes, famous people, and politicians also. Of course, now it's not the same... I hope it won't bother you. No, no. It doesn't bother me at all. I'm sure we'll become great friends. The children. You must be Ema. You must be Àngel. I'll be your teacher, and also your friend. Well, as long as it doesn't influence your studies. So. What have you been up to? You've been playing indians? There are little piggies. Pig yourself, f-fatty. Yes, and tomorrow they'll take a bath. 'Tomorrow' they'll wash? The plumbing here doesn't always work. It's really lovely. Ok then, thank you children. You like books? Did you bring any dolls? Dools? No, why? My uncle always gives me dolls. Hello. Pardon me? It's not time to play games. There's much to do tomorrow. To sleep now. Many thanks, children. These are for you. Goodnight. Yes, it could have been a fox, or a cat. Any animal really. There are many around here. Yes, perhaps. But it was a strange noise, and... - We should be careful of the children. - Yes, yes. By the way, don't they have a room each? Yes. There are three or four empty bedrooms. The house is very big. But they are like kittens. Kittens with no mommy. They need one another. Yes, but I'm not sure if it's good for their psychological well-being. We should be promoting certain individuality... With no mommy. A lightning bolt. Clara says it looks nicer like that. Isn't it? This is our secret hideout. Even Clara doesn't know about it. She's too f-f-fat to climb there. 'Too f-f-f-fat' Enough. What's secret about it? It's full of dolls. It's my best work. Be careful. It's very lovely. Girl. No kisses for me then? We can't complain of their manners. They have none. - How long is it since their parents... - Just about two years. Soon they'll get accustomed. Àngel! What will she think of you? Sorry. Good... Good, I think it's time to think of classes. Not everything is fun only. So now you will go and bathe, and I'll wait for you in the classroom. To bathe, I said! Where are they going?! I asked them to go and wash! - Clara, what are they doing?! - It's their bath. It's a horse trough! No, we have no horses. We did before. But Àngel fell off one, and we got rid of them. But... shouldn't they...? Is the water clean? Of course. I changed it last week. Oh good, it's all fine then. - And in winter, what do they do? - We bring it in here. This soap is disgusting. We should tell their uncle when he comes to bring men and repair things. Their uncle? He won't come. - Why not? - He hates this place. Hates the countryside. Oh, I see. Psychologically, this is not acceptable. They are so vulnerable. They have no idea. Vulnerable to what? He going to turn into a h-handsome prince! Oh yes, so handsome, just like you! Kids! Kids! Out we get. The towels are dirty, don't touch them. Àngel uses them for dirty things. Don't touch them! Ema! Angel, we have class now. Where did he go? With his friend. Who is it? He'll be back soon? Yes. Ema, you know you have your own bedroom. - It isn't proper that you sleep with your sleep. - Do you have parents? They died. I took care of them until the end. When did they die? Two months ago. He's finished. Àngel, where were you? Ema, Àngel, we need to talk. I know you didn't get the best education until now. And I'm sorry for it. But this needs to change. Your uncle put me in charge of you two. And you will listen and obey me. And I won't tolerate this. Àngel, if I ask you to come, you must come immediately. If we don't stick to these simple rules, I won't be able to continue with you. I will be forced to leave. Understood? Àngel, what's wrong? He doesn't like being told off. He's a baby. I don't think it's that. Something more is bothering you. What is it? I know I'm a little tough, and you are not used to this. I know you went through a tough period. But I'm here now. And I won't abandon you. I promise. It was the kid's grandfathers. They made a fortune. It was inherited by their children. Of course, the grandparents died. The children's parents also. They were very academic. Their father was a University profesor He was also a very keen archer. He won international prizes. Clara, can you have a kitten? No my dear. You know I'm allergic. And when you die, can we have one? My dear, I will outlive the kitten. I prefer the kitten. That's the transformer that got damaged some time ago. It does what it wants. The night came in. Without light, there's n-n-othing. We're here. I don't think so. It's only your m-m-memory. Like when p-p-people die. We invent lights. We invent everything. He's a thinker, like his dad was. It's the same everyday, usually at night. Clara, what are you doing here?! Mona, what are you doing here? Outside, there's a man I just saw Clara, are you ok? No. It was not your fault. Sorry, what fault? Surely he loved you the same way. There's no reason. No reason to punish yourself like that. With no mommy. I couldn't see well, but he had like.. his face... a badly shaven beard... He seemed like ...sad. And walked, .. like looking for something. Well, the only person who fits that description is the old gardener. But he left a long time ago. But don't let it worry you, it must have been a thief or a poacher. Thieves. Perhaps. It's strange though that the dogs didn't bark Clara? Were you feeling unwell last night? Unwell? No, why? You're not taking some medication? Medicines? No. Well. Maybe, yes, a little. I need to sleep. With these power cuts, and storms... I don't like storms. The kids neither. Àngel says they make him feel small. Another of Àngel's existencial problems. Who prescribes your drugs to you? The kids uncle is a doctor. He studied many years. Your therapist doesn't prescribe you anything? I'm sorry. Who are you talking about? Well.. I mean your doctor. Because you don't can't sleep either, right? Either way, there's something strange in the air here Why don't the kids go to live in the city? No. I've seen those city kids. They've forgotten what being human is, what nature is. They only see it through TV Kids! Kids! Ema! They're stupid. I'm gonna shoot an arrow in his head! What were they doing? There's a rabbit hole there. They're trying to catch it. Ema, it isn't proper that you bathe outside wearing nothing You cannot be naked, and need to cover yourself. Why? He's says it's more fun that way. I don't think Àngel is mature enough to know such things. No, not Àngel. Who then? Hello, I'm Mona, their tutor... Give the kid this message! I warned him already. Mona, are you OK?! Who was it? It's that boy's grandfather. That's why we stay clear of locals. They're very basic. Especially that man. He shoots cats and dogs. He's a danger. What did he do so bad? Put your head back, yes, like that. No idea. No idea. Nothing probably. Trouble is those kids blame him for things. Àngel is a good boy. Take these drops, they'll calm you. - What is it? - Medicinal. I can't find him. He loved him more than his own son. Sorry. Where are they going? Psychologically it's unacceptable. Vulnerable to what? Àngel! Àngel, what are you doing here? Bats. Th-they come here to sleep. Who was the man who was here? Which man? There was a man a minute ago here. For sure Ema told you that. She's always trying to get me into trouble. She's a liar. No, she didn't say it, why should she? It was me who saw him. Then it was me you saw. We need to talk of something serious. Why was that man who hit me so angry? Why did he hit me? Birds spend their time flying They look for food, they fight, and they eat. Then they hit the window And they die. Better not to be born at all. We should kill them, so they don't suffer. And this? Who did this to you? But, who would be a risk to them? He appeared again, that man, this morning. The Gardener, Clara! The dead gardener? What do you mean 'dead'. Didn't he leave? Well, yes. He left this world. He left a wife, and two sons behind. In fact, he's buried here. They didn't want him in the church cemetery. How is it possible? He didn't believe in God at all. My poor Marcelito, he was 20 years old when he died. I always have long talks with him. I try to calm his suffering. I see him up there, sometimes below I see walking, happy, wearing mommy's dress. Without his mommy. What were you saying about the gardener? Oh yes. Come with me. Is that him? Yes, it's him. How is this possible, Clara? He's come back. He's come back? But how could that be possible? Why would he do that? Àngel loved José. They'd spend many hours together. Spent many hours together? Yes, outside, in the fields. With the animals, when we had them. José taught him everything, more than his parents did. And they didn't stop him? Why? José was very good. He loved him more than his own son. Clara, I don't think you can understand this. He's come back for Àngel. The kids are so free, so vulnerable This is all obvious. Mona, I'm so grateful that you're here. I'm very happy. I couldn't manage alone. I couldn't I'm starting to understand the root if their traumas. Ema. Àngel! Kids. Ema! Àngel! Ema! Àngel! I've been calling you. It's class time. Come get dressed. You can't be outside all day. It isn't safe for you. It's also not good for you. What is that, Àngel? Ema? This isn't the bite of a child, correct? It's bigger. He was here? Who? You both know who I mean. The one who's behind that stone. I see it's going to be difficult. I'm at the helm of a drifting ship. But he's not going to win. Come with me, now! In... th... this chap... chapter... Y... You will st... start to ex... - explo... - Explor... Very good. Thank you. Àngel? Ángel. At least try. I have all day. Kids, I have no idea who taught you until now. But I know you learned nothing. You don't even know how to use latrines. The latrines are dirty. I want to do planets! Planets? You mean astronomy? Well... Ángel? Well then. In our solar system there are nine planets. In the middle is the sun, which is not a planet. But a...? - star. - I knew that! Very good. What's the name of the planet that's here, furthest from the sun. And therefore the coldest. Wh... where the dead people go? No... the dead... no one goes there. You the name of the farthest planet? The one that's after the blackboard? After the blackboard? Well... After it... You refer to space? Well, in space there are more planets and stars. And this goes on infinitely. It never ends. If we needed to list them we'd be here for decades. Wh... wh... which is the last planet then? - Stop talking, Mona showing us! - There isn't a last planet The universe expands and is infinite. There has to be a last planet! No, I assure you there isn't. Science tells us that universe expands, and never ends. The Earth is at a perfect distance from the sun Stop it now! Always trying to get attention! - Why did you tell me that?! - What? - About infinity and that it never ends! Calm down. If there was a last planet there would still be something after it. You're an idiot! We can't even have class with you! Enough kids! Enough! Enough, calm down! You're a bitch! A fucking bitch! Same as the other. And I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you! Calm down. - Clara! - Yes? You didn't tell me everything You need to tell me now. Why did Àngel say I was a 'bitch like the other'. Who is 'the other'? I see their uncle didn't tell you everything. If he had, you no doubt have refused the job. Now you've seen how lovely the kids are, and how much they need you... It was a good strategy. Yes, they are lovely, in their own different way And they need so much affection, it's obvious. But you are not answering me: Who is 'the other', how long was she here, and why did she leave? Well, she wasn't a good teacher, She wasn't qualified for the job. She didn't even teach them how to use latrines Their uncle chose her, and he feels very guilty for the mistake. But he did right with you. Their uncle also didn't tell me how their parents died. How did it happen, Clara? It was horrible. How is that possible? The installations of this house are a century old We were not able to replace the transformer since. My God. I've been put in charge of two deeply traumatised children. And on top of it, their vulnerability has been abused. And they still have not been able to find closure to this tragedy. They saw their parents die, and have no one to blame for it. Why would they blame someone? Wasn't it an accident? Well, ...who knows. An error. Maybe a worker we had, it could have been anyone, who knows? They've not been able to cry their death. Same as you. You speak like their uncle. It's unbelievable what you are telling me, Clara. Why 'the same as me'? Unjust, terrible... They would be so much better if they could release that anxiety they harbour inside. Would you be able to help them? Yes, it's what I most want. I would sacrifice myself for them. I would as well! Truly, you would really do that? They've done nothing to deserve this. Thank you, Mona. They need you. But first Clara, we're going to put some things in order here first. I guess this is how you ate when you were a family. Now we're a new family. That's all there is? Yes. It's healthy food. I made it myself, and it's delicious. So now eat. Where's the meat? Thankfully, no animal died for us today. Amen. What's wrong Clara? You hurt the carrot. Please. I'm trying to educate these children. Something that is greatly missing here. When I fart, even the spiders hide. Spiders! Angel! Sorry. I want meat. Enough! I forbid you to say one more word! Your uncle put me in charge here, and you will respect me. I want no more rudeness or disgusting behaviour. Do you hear me?! When you're dead, I'll even eat your bones. She is exactly how Isabel used to be. Bless your dear uncle. Mona. Sorry. I pr...promise, I w...won't kill you. Ángel don't make things worse please. Can I keep this when you go? When I go? I'm not going anywhere. Ema said you would give it to her. I know it's not true. I'm sorry. I'm bad. I know you don't do it on purpose. It isn't you. Am I bad? - None of this is your fault. - I must be bad. Mona? You want some soup? Mona. Sometimes I bleed. From where do you bleed? Àngel, no. Come here. Clara. I slept like I was in a coma. What time is it? Almost midday. That can't be... And the kids, where are they? I don't know. You must know, we can't leave them alone. Yes, now I recall, they mentioned the swimming pool. Àngel! Ema! Kids you can't be there. It's not natural to be naked! Kids I'd rather we were not here. We're not alone. There's no one here! Look Mona! Where did you go last night, when you ran off? Y... you said there was someone, so I went to see. - You talked with him? - With who? With the man. I'm the man of your dreams! Why are you standing there in front of me? Trying to impress me? I've seen bigger than that. Go get dressed. You never had a boyfriend! What? Clara told me. And what else did she tell you?! - Mona take your clothes off! - No thank you. You came for him?! Get out of here, go! Get out now, we're going! How dare you watch them in that way?! Go away! Come on, we're going now. Come on. Àngel and me we're going to have babies. Don't be stupid, who told you that? I myself am going to deal with this now. Three babies. So, he was badly shaven, and what was he wearing? He had workman's clothes, like those of a gardener. - He spoke to the kids? - No. Well yes, from afar. He didn't come near them, touch you or them? Today no because thankfully I was there. So when did the abuse take place? They are victims of abuse the whole time. Especially the boy. He goes with him often. The boy goes to see the man? No, the man comes and takes him away. Kid, when did you last see him? I didn't see him. Don't lie to him, tell him the truth. Or we won't be able to help you. I understand that you don't know about these things But I studied it deeply. Negation is the natural reaction of a traumatised child. These kids feel a terrible guilt. I ask that you believe me, and take it seriously. Clara. Clara, do you have any explanation regarding a certain... precociousness in the kids? What do you refer to? They seem... mature regarding certain themes. At a sexual level. You're worried they will corrupt you? They're only like little animals. Like lambs. No sooner they arrive, they start humping each other. Haven't you seen them? What a city lady you are. Everything is instinct and innocence. Humping gleefully in the fields. When you were a girl, you also had little fingers didn't you? Yes, but not for that! You've just forgotten then! No, no. Sorry. It's just that I was brought up in the country. And I'm too vulgar. But sit back down, sit. Clara, I'd like to think you don't share 'country' things with the kids. That would explain certain things. Poor kids. They can't even go to school. Idleness is the mother of all vices. And also the good vices. There! You do it on purpose. Worried you'll hurt your little birdies. One shouldn't kill animals for sport. If it's not for sustenance, it's cruel. Yes, I agree. Kids, stop that! I'm not surprised they painted them for centuries. Painted who? Boys like Àngel. He's so beautiful. Yes, true. Ema also paints Àngel. Ema is a great artist and a lovely girl. Yes of course, Ema is beautiful also. Kids, food's ready! You remind me so much of my brother. Ema, Àngel. We need to talk. Kids, we need to talk. You need to know I love you both, and I want to help you. Especially you. Àngel... Who wrote that? This is serious, who wrote this?! Who d'you think? The gardener, I understand. At least tell me the truth, even if you don't tell the police. The gardener! He's dead. Stop it both of you! You know he's here! How on earth can this man write that?! He didn't. Can't you see it's babies writing? You're a baby. You can't write. Don't be stupid. Àngel would never write this! Àngel, he forced you to write it? Àngel, come here! From now on, you're sleeping in separate beds. Who are you? Ah yes, you're the policeman. You have information on the man? - Which man? - The gardener, the one I mentioned. Look, I don't have much time. I come to tell you, you seem like a good person. Not like the other teacher. That's why I suggest you say goodbye to the kids and leave this place. - Why would I go? - This is no place for you. They've called us here many times for all sorts of problems. - Why? All for the same reason? - No, not really. After the parents were murdered, we came here at least 4 times. What are you saying, 'Murdered'? Wasn't it an accident? An accident? They didn't tell you? No, of course not. Why would they? So let's see... Who then killed them? The teacher before you. Don't be ridiculous! Why would she do such a thing? You're just trying to scare me off. I'm not trying to frighten you. We don't know why she did it. Some say she was insane, and wanted to keep the kids for herself. Others say the parents were doing strange things with their kids. And she wanted to protect them. But wasn't stable. Don't say idiotic things. So, let's see, where is she now? I don't know. Perhaps some institution. I think the parents took her away - There was never any proof against her. - Of course. So, a demented and assassin teacher, right? She was the kid's uncle's patient. He gave her a job here. And how would you know this, if you never come here? I wasn't here. But those who worked here left just after. I know two of them, and they saw things. You think I'm stupid? You want me to leave. You come without uniform, ... You're a friend of the gardener, right? You've come for the children. Get lost! Go! And leave the kids alone! Ángel. Can I come in? No! Why won't you let me in? You made fun of me. And you made me feel bad. I didn't laugh, Ema did. I would never make fun of you. You need to tell me why that man hit me. Why was he so angry? You know you can tell me everything. I'm your friend. - You stole from him? - No. I don't steal. He caught you? Doing things? With the other boy? OK, I understand. What were you doing? Don't worry. You also do it with other boys? Only w... with those I l...like. Why are you crying? Sometimes I c... cry... because it's sad to cry. They all hate me. Why do you say that? Who hates you? Everyone. At school they hated me. And n... n... now they don't allow me to go back. I understand. They had told me something else. I'm like the b... bird that hit the window. I'm all broken inside. Don't worry, I'll fix you. You're not bad. Someone is putting bad ideas into your head. W... what bad ideas? If they were not bad, you would not be crying. It's the dark soul of the gardener that is surrounding you. I can see it. And you can also. He stole your soul. Someone's forcing you to do these things. And you know who it is. You need to be honest with me. Who is it? Is there someone? Y... ye.... Àngel, what are you doing?! That isn't proper. You cannot do that! He put those ideas in your mind?! It was him, wasn't it! You making me feel bad again! You came into my room when I said no, and no you don't let me do anything! - Why d... did you come here? - Because I love you! I don't! I'm going to Ema's bedroom. No Àngel! Come back here! Open Àngel, open! Come out of there immediately! Ema! Ema and Àngel come out of there! Open the door. Let me come in! - Ema, open. - Me and Àngel, we're going to make babies! What?! Open this door now! - You already had Àngel before! Get away from here, get away! Let me in! Ema, open this door! Clara tell him to leave! Tell the kids to open! - Tell that man to leave! - But which man? That one! Open the door! - Clara will bring you your pills! - Clara, ...there! - There! Can't you see him? - Where Mona? I don't know... I want him to leave the children alone! There! There he is! Ok, let's see. Calm down. I'm going to see. - Where, tell me exactly where Mona. - There! - But where Mona? - Clara, don't do this to me please! - But I'm looking, I don't see anyone. There! You truly believe the kids are being abused? Don't you see it?! Their behaviour, their violence, their ...knowledge. - Everything makes sense now. - Sit down, take it easy. The kids will be sleeping now. Have your tea. I understand that a loved one Can appear to someone But this? It would be... What's the word? A necrophile. A necrophile, but the other way round. A dead person making love to the living. That's just horrible. There must be a word for it... - Biophile. - What? Biophile. It must be illegal. - I think the time has come to seek help. - Yes! We need help. Because the police won't do anything and we must tell their uncle. Yes, you're right we must tell the uncle. What's wrong, you're feeling ill? You're feeling tired? - I don't know, I'm hot. - You're hot? Well, let's go to your room. You'll be more relaxed there. Come, come. Today you'll be a bird. But you won't be able to fly. Take, this will calm you down. Medicinal After the parents were murdered we came four times. We have little time. Why don't you come with me? So? I don't like girls. They smell bad. My son neither. But you can't stay like that all your life. It didn't help my poor Marcelito. I'm sure you'll start liking it. In any case, I'll be waiting for you. Your uncle will arrive soon. - Who prescribes your drugs? - Their uncle is a doctor. Medicinal And now I'm cutting your wings. If he'd told you, you wouldn't have come. It was a good strategy Your friend is waiting for you. - Where? - There. He's hiding. We've not been able to fix the transformer since. - Who killed them? - The teacher who was here before you. - She wasn't a very good teacher. Their uncle didn't tell me how the parents died. Maybe a worker we had... Anything. - Get out of here! - Have you seen my boy? - Get lost! - Haven’t you seen my boy José? - I've been looking for him... - Get lost I said! - I'm taking the kids to the city, so leave them alone! They're going to kill you! José! Ángel. Ema. José? José! Ema! Angel! Enough! Come here! Let's go. We're going to go and see your uncle. Come, we have no time. - And Clara? - Clara's staying here. Ema, come here, your uncle will be waiting, come on! The buses will be leaving soon, come on. - I don't want to go. - Come on it'll be fun. - And Clara? - Clara is staying, she'll come later. - I didn't bring my paints. - Your uncle has many paints. - My uncle told you nothing. - Come on, the bus will leave... Kids, a car! Sir. Could you take us to... - Kids, it's your uncle! I was just trying to call you... I was wondering if with the kids we could... What fright you gave me Mona. I thought something bad had happened. Come on, let's go. No, I would prefer we talked about this in another place... Come on, get in it's all fine Come in. What's going on with you? You have no idea do you? Sorry? I paid for you for something. To not bother me. Sorry, but this is about the physical safety of the children. Especially Àngel. I don't want to speak behind her back, Clara is pleasant enough But she's not a good influence on them. If you don't want to speak behind her back why are you whispering? I'm very sorry you had to come, but the kids are in danger. Yes, so I heard. It seems they are under threat by a ...ghost. Yes. No. It's not a ghost. I recognised the old gardener. Clara confirmed it. Mona, the gardener died two years ago. There's a photo of him with the boy. You pass it every day. I thought you may had overcome these things, but no. You're in regression, and that disappoints me. What do you mean about 'regression'? I told you I would not leave anyone take care of my nephews. I know your therapist He's a colleague. and a personal friend. What? You spoke to him? Who gave you the contact for this job? You lost your memory as well as your mind? He's not entitled to talk about me. It's not ethical! Between doctors it is. And it was obviously necessary. You've regressed into your state of paranoia... You’re turning me into ridicule. And whilst we talk, the kids are being corrupted! The same way your brother corrupted you? Yes, like he abused me! As I said, you're regressing. You already admitted they were your fantasies. You felt guilty of the death of your brother because you desired him. - You already accepted that - I am not your patient. This is not about me. We're talking of the kids and of their innocence! You still believe in kid's innocence? That explains why you believe in ghosts. Of course they are! And you're a lunatic! Lunatic?! Of course I'm a lunatic! You think my psychotic patients would pay me if I didn't know about it first hand? No, that's your way. Talking without knowing. Spewing your moral venom on everyone. In any case this is not working. The only thing you achieved was to terrorise them. I want you to leave You can mean that. You know the kids need me. Leave me take them to the city. Since my parents died I have room for them. Tomorrow first thing, I need to leave. I want you to pack. I'll pay you the current month, and another, for the bother. But I'll ask only one thing of you. Don't say a single more word to the kids. They've heard enough stupidities already. I know he has something to tell me. And then you will be forced to believe me. The kid's outside? Yes, yes. Ángel! I'm bird, I'm a firebird! Àngel come here! You can't catch me! Ángel I said come here! I'm a firebird! Come here, you're possessed! Fucking bitch! - Look! Now tell me there isn't anyone there! - Let me go! Your crazy! Tell me what you did together and we'll get rid of him! There never was anyone, crazy filthy bitch! Tell me, and he won't harm you anymore! Let me go! Coward! Face the kid, and confess your crimes! Confess your crimes! Coward, coward!... Filthy whore! Killer whore! Bitch! Where are the kids? They're fine. - And the uncle? - He's left. I need to see Àngel, he wants to speak to me. Àngel doesn't want to see you. Nor Ema. They hate you. He made them hate me. You never accept any faults do you? The only person they loved after their parents was José. And you want to dirty everything because of jealousy. What are you talking about? I thought we were in this together, to help them. Help them? From what? They saw their own parent murdered in front of them, that's not enough for you? You need to add more traumas for you to feel good? Murdered? So, ...it's true that the previous one killed them? That idiot policeman told you? I thought so. Yes, it's true. The insane woman imagined they were her own children to defend even against their parents Their uncle feels very guilty. But he's correcting it. Correcting? Correcting how? He left, and left the kids alone. More vulnerable to abuse than ever before. The abuse you dream of every night? Look at you. It's the kids who abused of you. You made them feel stupid. You taught them only shame. And now you crown yourself their protector? - You're crazy, Clara. - Yes, yes. I'm crazy. Everyone is crazy except you. There are ghosts, or not? Well, it seems the jury is still out deliberating. Why are you treating me like this? You killed my son! It was people like you who pushed him to kill himself. Yes, so he preffered men, and all his life he heard he was an unnatural pervert. But where did my little one come from if it wasn't from nature? From Saturn?! He believed them, believed he was bad. Believed in all those stupidities. And look at you people now. Yesterday attacking these so-called perverts and today screaming in the street for tolerance, crying compassionately for men in love. Feasting when they marry them in churches Oh, how angry it makes, all of this... How many false morals from even more false people! And now I'm supposed to swallow your moralistic stupidities?! You've drugged me again. I'm going to denounce you for aiding this child abuse. Oh, how well their uncle chose you. Another psychotic bitch who never had what she most wanted: a big cock hard inside her ass. But you'll no longer know how good it feels. What will you do to me? You said you would sacrifice anything. Don't sacrifice the children. Sacrifice yourself. The kids need closure. And so do I. - Didn't you say this was loose?! - Yes, it is. Leave that and come and help! She'll be with her brother now. It's beautiful. - You have candles for tonight? - Yes, yes. Tomorrow I'll see if someone can fix the transformer. It's really time. Kids, do you feel better now? I do. They'll feel better soon. They still need to process it all.
