Directed by Yasujiro Ozu Who stars in the film? Jean Marais. He's really cool. - Come with me, Auntie? - Not today. Please come. It'll be fun. It's OK. You go on your own. There's Non-chan! I wonder where he's going. He walks so carefully! As he always does. Non-chan... nonchalant. It's Nishi-Ginza. Turn right at the PX. Why don't you drop in at Aya's? Let's do that. Yes? The bill from Hananoya. Pay it. Mrs Satake is here. Miss Setsuko, too. Alright. I'll take this. Please wrap it. Yes? - How do you do? - How do you do. - How are you, Setsuko? - Hello. - What did you do after that? - When? After we ate at the Shinbashi Club. That day? I took a walk with Setsuko. We passed a Kabuki theatre, so we went in. Good. Was it fun? I'd never seen it from the gallery. It's so high up. Like looking into a well. The actor looked this small. But it was fun. Oh, that was good. Did you go there? Where? - Ring! Jingle-jangle... - Pachinko? - Did you try? - No, I didn't. Try once. It's fun. - Don't do any such thing. - It looks fun. - Please take me... - No, no, don't do it. Scary auntie. At her age, anything is fun. - True. The best time of life. - Why? Things change when you get married. - Why? - Husbands can be harsh. They complain all the time, leaving you no time for playing Pachinko. Really? Yes, they are. It's so annoying... Well, not that bad! Setsuko, coffee? No, thank you. Auntie, I need to go. Yes? Take care. - You off somewhere? - Yes. - Where? - Piccadilly Theatre. Oh, Jean Marais. Is he your type? What do you like about him? The top half of his face? Or the bottom? I've got to go. Goodbye! Drop by on the way back. I'll treat you. Seriously. - It's such a nice day. - Yes. - I want to go out. - Where to? Anywhere... a spa? Overnight? New leaves are beautiful at this time. Shall we go? - Now? - You can't? - I wouldn't say that. - Your husband? Can't you think of anything? - An excuse. - Class reunion. I've already used that excuse. How about Setsuko getting sick? How? She goes on an excursion, and poor her, she gets ill. It wouldn't work. It'll be fine. I'll explain it to her when she drops by. What would Setsuko do? She can stay here overnight. I see. You're very clever. Oh, thank you. Well, I'll call my husband. Which spa? Hakone? How about Shuzenji? Shuzenji sounds good. Hello? Toa Trading? May I speak to Satake, please? Thank you. What time is the train? By car, we'll be in time for 4:15, even after dropping by yours. Really? Oh, hello? Yes... yes... Is that so? No, that's fine, thank you. - What was it? - He's not in. He went out with a client. I see. I wonder where he is? Welcome. - You've been waiting for long? - About 30 minutes. Did you finish your work? Beer, please? - What was in the exam? - Financial theory. That was likely. Did you do it well? So-so. What is CPS? Consumer Price Survey. Oh, you know it well. Did you get that? - No. - Did you pass it? I think it was fine. Then let's toast. - I did fine, didn't I? - How would I know? I did OK. Right? It's OK? I don't know. It's not my company. You're being cold! If you join the company, tell your family. - I will. - How old is your mother now? She's 63. Already? Time flies. I used to visit your brother, when I was in secondary school. Mother aged after he was killed in the war. I see. Nice suit. I got it second-hand. - Any bugs in it? - No. Do you know what Nankin- bug is in English? - Well, it's peanuts... - That's Nankin- beans. Oh, that's right. It sounds like you won't need a guarantor. I will. I'll join the company, surely. Isn't it great? - It's your best time. - Yes, it is. It's May. We're young. Yes? Master is home. OK. - Welcome home. - Hello. You're late. Did you have a client? Yes. - I called you. - Did you? What did you call me for? Nothing. - Are you hungry? - I've already eaten. I cooked delicious fish. What did you have? I was about to meet a client, when Non-chan came. I see. Did you take a bath? Will you take it now? I've been waiting for you. Didn't you take it first? No. Well... listen... - I... - What is it? I went to Aya's shop. - And... did you know? - What? Setsuko is in Shuzenji. No, I didn't. I didn't, either. Were there any phone calls for me? No. Setsuko is there for a class reunion. But she got stomach pains. - Who? - Setsuko. They say she's in pain. - Where? - Stomach. It isn't appendicitis? Appendicitis? How terrible. Will she be alright? Appendicitis is fine, if it's treated early. I'm worried. Shouldn't we do something? She must be Ionely. She likes me, and must miss me. Poor girl. Why don't you go? Do you think so? How about housework? It's fine. You can still go there tonight. No, it'll be OK till tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow. She'll be happy. Hm... Miss Setsuko is here. Good evening! - Setsuko. What happened? - Can I stay over? It's late. - Hello. - Hello. What happened? I'm glad. I was so worried. - I thought you were at Shuzenji. - Who? You. Is your stomach OK? - My stomach? - Are you feeling better? It must have been painful. We really worried. We were shocked. What are you talking about? You. About you. How strange. Who was it about? What are you talking about? We just met a while ago. - What a fool you are. - What is it? How stupid to come at this time. What is it? You didn't drop by at Aya's as you'd promised. What a fool. Hello? Aya? Setsuko just came here. Yes... that's right. Yes, what a mess. Yes, I know. Yes... yes... Then who'll be sick now? What? Is someone sick, Auntie? Go away. You're nosey. No, not you. Yes? Who? Takako? That's a good idea. She's perfect. Hello? I'm still talking. This line is busy. It's a nice day. I feel great. Behave, you have appendicitis. Oh, I've forgotten. You can't eat that. Here, Setsuko. - This is delicious. - Yes, it is. - Do you want some? - Yes. Don't drink too much. You have appendicitis. Stop it. I'm beginning to feel pain here. - Really? - Yes. It pricks. Great. That's a good news. Just as we planned. What a relief. Well, do you want a bit more pain? Ouch, ouch. Didn't your husband guess? No. But almost. I wish he could guess. Sometimes his sluggishness is useful. But not always. How convenient. He's a bit slow, if you don't mind me saying. That's right. He's dull. Dull-san. - Dull-san? - That's a good name. Do you want some, Setsuko? - Don't tell your uncle. - Seriously. Don't worry. I'm glad you got appendicitis, instead of me. But next time, it'll be you. Hello? OK, wait a moment. It's connected to Tokyo. Hello? Is that Fumi? Is the Master there? Dull-san is there. Hello, it's me. I arrived here around 5:00 p.m. Takako has appendicitis. Yes. She was in pain, but she's better now and sleeping. No, an operation is not necessary. Yes. I'll be home tomorrow. I may be late. Goodnight. - Shall we order more sake? - A hot one. Hello, we need more sake... Oh, are you still on line? Goodnight. I'm done with Tokyo. Can we have more sake? Make it hot, please. - You're pretty good. - You're used to it. Setsuko, this is a secret. More sake? A hot one is coming. - Shall we sing? - Like what? At the time violets bloom... Remember, we skipped classes after lunch to see the revues. We did. From the first time I met you I thought of you days and nights All those days I suffered lovesick... At the time violets bloom... Even now... my heart is stirred up... What is it, Setsuko? Anything wrong, Setsuko? I feel sick. Are you OK? What is it? Master... Shall I make your bed? Yes, please. After that, retire. My wife will be back tomorrow. Yes, sir. Fumi, how was your brother's exam to join the police? He passed it, thank you. That's good. Where will he serve? In Sendai. Won't your parents have difficulties if he goes away? Well... But I have another brother. What does he do? Teaches primary school. So no worries for your parents. That's good, everyone's well. That's best. Thank you. Shall I make some tea? No, please rest. - Then goodnight, sir. - Goodnight. Pity I missed this game. They had four home-runs. I love game-ending home-runs. What's the matter, Setsuko? I still have a headache. See? You drank too much. You forced her to drink! Poor girl! Don't drink any more. Look who's talking. What a selfish aunt. Oh, look. There are so many! Oh, that one. Come and look. - What is it? - Come, come. - What? - What is it? - Look, that one. - Which? That black one. Don't you think it resembles someone? - That big and slow one. - Don't say that. - It does. - No, it doesn't. Right? It's too late to flatter. That one, right? It's a lookalike. - Who? Uncle? - Don't say it aloud. Good morning, Dull-san. Dull-san, please eat some. Have some, Dull-san. - Oh, another one snatched it. - Eat, eat! - It got taken away again. - Oh, you're too slow. Uncle hasn't had any. Poor thing. Darling, don't blame me for you being hungry at work. Oh, where's your bag? Don't you need it? Setsuko, can you bring his bag, please? Fumi! Master's bag, please! Oh, your tie is askew again. Have your hair cut on the way home. That's enough. Lucky me. There's no bald carp. Oh, look, Uncle ate one finally. That skinny and long one... - Doesn't it look like my husband? - Yes, a bit. Bonjour! Don't catch cold from swimming. Where is he now? He's returned to Paris from Lyon. Wish my man would go somewhere. Somewhere far. Like where? Anywhere. Somewhere I don't have to see him. There goes capricious Taeko. It's so sunny. Shall we stay another night? I'm OK, as long as I'm home Tuesday. - What's on Tuesday? - A baseball game. How about you, Taeko? Left, Miyake. Number 27. Centre, Sekikawa. Number 25. Look, your husband is here. Oh, that's true. He didn't tell me he was coming. Is he alone? It looks like it. - It's odd. - Why? He's not interested in baseball. He's taking out a cigarette. Looking for matches... There she is. - Who is it? - I don't know. Where is she from? - Shinbashi? - I don't think so. - Akasaka? - No, probably Nishi-Ginza. - Nishi-Ginza? - There's a bar he often goes to. I think she's from there. She's pretty. - You look pale. - Liar. - Horns sprouting. - No way. They look close. - Aren't you angry? - No. - Good for you. - I'm lucky. - I'll make him buy me something. - That kimono we saw. He doesn't know, but this is an expensive game. It's his fault. You can't escape, poor man. Attention please... Mrs Taeko Satake from Meguro, Mrs Taeko Satake, please go home immediately. - What is it? - What? I wonder what's happened? Mrs Taeko Satake from Meguro. Mrs Taeko Satake, please go home immediately. Welcome home. Welcome home. What's the urgent matter? Miss Setsuko is here. Is that why you called me? She called you herself. Welcome home. - What is it? - Something's happened. Oh, I'm sweating all over. They announced it so loud. Fumi, something cold to drink! Thank you. - What for? - Shuzenji. So what is the urgent matter? - Have you heard? - Of what? My mother wants an arranged meeting. Oh, that. Go ahead and do it. I don't want to. I don't like arranged marriages. What are you saying? Meet him. You must. - So you agree with Mother? - Of course. You think so little of me. I don't like it. But you can't just idle about forever. How old do you think you are? 21. 23 by the old calendar. I won't marry just yet. I don't want an arranged marriage. Silly girl. But don't you agree? Look at yourself. What? Do you think you're happy? I am happy. You're lying. You're not happy. I can see it. I've heard from my mother that your marriage was arranged. - So what? - That's why you don't get on. - How? - On lots of things. We do get along. No, you don't. So why did you lie to him to come to Shuzenji? Because I wanted to go. You came as well. Why not tell him the truth? You're too young to understand. Then I hate grown-ups. You called that fat, black, slow carp Uncle. I feel sorry for him. It's not your business. I won't take you anymore. That's fine. When I get married, I won't say bad things about my husband. I won't marry such a man. I'll find one myself. I hate arranged marriages. Yes? What a girl. You'll understand someday. I don't want to understand. I will never call my husband Dull-san in front of other people. The president wants you. Me? Hello, it's been a long time. You called me, sir? As your father-in-law is here... Well, sit down. Yes, sir. I had some business with Mr Okawa. I've heard you're pretty busy. How's your business? I think the current economical situation will continue till autumn. Yes? A guest for you, Mr Satake. - For me? - Yes. Please excuse me. Wait a second. Tell Taeko to come to Oiso sometime. I will. Excuse me. I'm thinking of sending Satake abroad. I see. Hi. - Hello - What's up? - I got the job. - Well. Congratulations. That's good. You'll be my guarantor? That's fine. Are you busy today? - Why? - To celebrate. - My treat? - No, mine. That's a rarity! - Let me today. - Where are we going? There's a nice restaurant nearby. Their pork cutlets are this big, and cheap. Can you come back at five? OK. I'll wait outside. See you later. CALORIE HOUSE - It was delicious, wasn't it? - It was OK. Ah, I missed it. - Their Tenshin bowl is good. - Really? - Do you want one? - No, I've had enough. Hey, the number one is broken! Would you like to come to mine? You're doing well. The trick is not to snap too hard. Say, would you come to mine? Um... Not today. Is your wife that scary? Not really. - Oh, no. - What? It doesn't work. Doesn't it? Hey, number 18 is not working! Don't bang on it. Because it doesn't work. Banging won't help. Which hole is that? This one. Oh... you're Corporal... Is that you? Oh, Corporal... hello. Hi. It's been a long time. Please come inside. Please, please. Who was that? We were in the same platoon during the war. Were you? Please, come this way. You, too. Please come in. Hey, we have guests. Here you go. Please. It's been a long time. It has, really. You haven't changed, Corporal. You haven't either. It's good to see you well. Oh, no, I'm getting old. This is my wife. I'm so indebted to him. - Oh, thank you very much. - Not at all. I ran into Takahashi at Shibuya Station. I saw Fujita the other day, in Ginza. Is Fujita in Tokyo as well? Yes. He runs a car repair shop. Does he? Please. Thanks. I didn't expect to see you tonight. Neither did I. I've been doing this for a year and a half. Thank you for banging, that made me meet the corporal. Sorry about that. That's fine. I'm glad. So glad. How's your business? It looks busy. Well, it's OK. I think it will go down soon. This is not a good business. But it's quite enjoyable. Do you think so? Do you play occasionally? No, this is my first time. How about you? I play sometimes. You've been here a couple of times. Yes, I have. It's not good. It's not a good thing to be trendy. I regret it. Please have some. - Yes... - Please. - Please. - No, thanks. I think it'll be the rage. It certainly is fun. You think so? Such games shouldn't be regarded as fun. Society won't get better while such a game is popular. - It shouldn't. - Is that so? It's bad. Remember those days in Singapore? Yes. But I'm glad the war is over. It was horrible. Yes, I agree. It was horrible. Definitely. But I wonder how it is, the North Bridge. Yes, I wonder. Those wonderful palm trees. And the beautiful sky. We could see lots of stars at nights. That's right. The Southern Cross... that was great. That was really great. My friend who tried to go first in action... My brave best friend who died in the war. Holding his ashes in my arms we walk through the streets of Singapore, in the morning. Look, my friend, the peaceful, blue ocean. The Southern Cross over the Malacca Channel. Days and nights during the continuous attacks... We watched together the Southern Cross. OISO Grandpa, Auntie Aya is here. Oh, is she? Come, come. I'm coming soon. Hurry, hurry. - I told him. - Thank you. So what he's like? The son of an embassy secretary in Sweden. Have you met him? Not yet. But my husband did, as he's also from Keio University. I see. How do you do? Oh, welcome. - I'm telling her about Setsuko. - Oh, please go with her. - To Togeki theatre? - No, Kabuki. Is that right? Oh, I've sent you the usual money. Thank you. Don't spend too much. It's hard for Mokichi. I'm not wasting it. That's good to know. Taeko, how about this Sunday? It's fine with me. But has Setsuko agreed? Yes, finally, last night. Did Brother persuade her? Yes. She was complaining at first, but he scolded her. - I'm surprised she agreed. - Very reluctantly. Same as I did. It was Father that scolded me. - You were crying. - Was I? What's Setsuko doing? She went off into her room. And she left early in the morning. What a girl. What a difference from our days. Isn't it? She reads foreign novels. I had a sneak look and was surprised. Scandalous, books these days. I agree. Sister, did you find Setsuko? - No. - Is she in the toilet? No. I've looked everywhere. Where is she? I don't know... The restaurant, maybe? Oh, maybe. Let's go. - Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you. I won't cause you any trouble. I wouldn't like that. It'll be fine. Shall we go out? It's so sunny and nice. Let's go. Have you been there often? Yes. It's exciting. Especially when the one you bet on is passing the others in the final lap. It's so thrilling. So, let's go. Well... shall I try? Yes, let's go. It's great fun. It's so much better than Pachinko. You can get obsessed with Pachinko. Really? It's like... I'm in the crowd, but I feel above them. I can be totally on my own. There's just me and those balls. I can escape from all my troubles. The ball becomes myself. Pure solitude. I see the charm in it. It's a happy sense of solitude. I see. The bicycle race is better. It's like a Pachinko ball on the bike. It's fun just watching people around you. It's the epitome of life. Is that so? Hey, Fumi! Fumi? Oh. When did you get here? Just now. Did you call, sir? - I'm going out. - Yes, sir. Isn't your arranged meeting today? Didn't you go to Kabuki? I did. But I slipped away pretending to go to the toilet. Without telling them? Yes. That's wrong. They must be looking for you. It's OK. It's not OK. It's wrong. But I don't want to do it. Arranged marriages are uncivilized. You can't help that. You have to go back. No. - Everyone's looking for you. - No. Let's go. No. No. You must go. Let's go. No. You must. Oh, hello. Shall we make a move? - I'll take you there. - To where? - Kabuki theatre. - That's amazing. Come on, let's go. Come on. We're going. Come on. The sixth race starts soon... What's Setsuko's man like? - I haven't seen him yet. - Those meetings can be embarrassing. Young people today can be embarrassed? How about you? I was a bit embarrassed. Were you? I would be as well. Uncle! - I was looking for you. - What happened? I escaped. You shouldn't. You'll be in trouble. Who cares? - You should. - It's OK. They're starting. Good. Which one did you bet on? Red and Black. Red is no good... It passed! Great! CALORIE HOUSE Setsuko, you should go home. It's still early. Look, Uncle. Stop it, and go home. Not yet. I'm just getting good at it. How is it? It's OK. Try number four. You, try number four. That's a good machine. Setsuko, you must go home. Don't worry. I'm going home. Go ahead. Oh, dear... I'm going, seriously. Please do. See, Uncle? - I'm going. - Are you? - Please walk her to the station. - Yes, I will. - Take this. - Goodbye. Are you going? Yes. I have to be up early. Goodbye. Thank you. Setsuko, you really should go home. Goodbye. You came of your own will. Don't tell them you were with me. I know. Are you sure? Goodbye. Hey, Number 16 is not working! RAMEN NOODLE BAR - Oh, it's hot. - That's why it's good. Why did you escape from the arranged meeting? Because I don't like it. It's too old-fashioned. It's OK to try. It can be fun. - I don't even want to have a look. - Don't you? But maybe he's very good looking. - Even so, I don't do it. - Why not? Arranged marriage is not necessarily a bad thing. - Why? - What matters is his personality. - But I don't feel any affection. - You may love him later. I'd have a look, if I were you. And if she was nice, I'd fall for her. It's that simple? Simple is good. That's my principle. No, it's like dogs and cats. But Setsuko-san, you make things too complicated. From far above, it's all the same. - How is it? Isn't it delicious? - Yes, it is. Ramen soup is best. It's not enough being delicious. - It has to be cheap, too. - Really? There are lots of delicious and cheap foods. A yakitori place there is great. Try it sometime. Yes, please take me. But Madam would be angry. Don't worry about Auntie. Really? Another bowl? - No, I've had enough. - Have you? Hey, one more ramen. With a lot of soup! I heard Setsuko was here. When was it? About an hour after you'd left. So I took her to the Kabuki theatre. She didn't come. We looked everywhere. Did you? What is she thinking? Hmm... It's been arranged. It was very rude to him. It's so rude. She's too carefree. Isn't she? She's too reckless. That's wrong. Both my brother and sister spoiled her. She became selfish. We have to tell her straight, not spoil her. Please tell her so. Will you? Yes, you're right. Honestly? Please tell her. Yes, I will. I've never been in a situation like today. I was sweating all over. Hmm... What a girl. She really is. Uncle. Oh, when did you get here? Didn't you go home? My mother must be angry. Your aunt, as well. She's better. Mother never stops. Is Auntie already asleep? She's still up. Don't tell her what I told you. - Setsuko. - Good evening, Auntie. What was that, today? I'm sorry. I won't speak to you. Please tell her off. - Um... - She needs talking to. Setsuko, sit down. Come and sit down. It's your fault, Setsuko. It's an arranged meeting. You can't cancel it like this. It's so rude to him. - You're too restless and carefree. - Yes, you are. It's wrong. You have to think carefully. Think it over. This is the important time of your life. You're not a child anymore. Yes, listen carefully. Listen. Everyone's worrying about you. And you act like this... Oh, Uncle, you are mean. I warned you. You're being a good boy. Um. Well, that's that. Listen... I've won a lot since you left. I gave Non-chan half. But I still have this much. I'll go again. You shouldn't hit it too hard. You hold it like this, release it slowly. And it goes... You... You were with Setsuko today. Why did you lie to me? Why? It's not... Not what? I didn't tell a lie. What was it, then? I just... didn't tell you. It's the same thing. You knew about the arranged meeting. That was why I took her to the Kabuki theatre. But she didn't come! - It's true, Auntie. He saw me off. - So why didn't you come? Where did you go? - Leave her be about it. - No, I won't. Why should I? We can't help if she doesn't want to do it. Why can't we help? But... we can't... Why? Why can't we help? You can't force her to marry if she doesn't want to. It'll only make another couple like us. Oh, I see. I understand that very well. Is it alright, Uncle? Um. I don't care. Well, we can't help it. I see. When did it happen? About 10 days ago. And you haven't spoken to him since? How is he doing? Occasionally, he seems to want to talk. The other night, I went to bed early and he came home late drunk, knocking on my door. I pretended to sleep, while he kept calling me. I'm amazed at your patience. I wouldn't last for two days. It's not patience. I don't want to talk to him. You're too selfish. You'd lied to him, too. Are there any couples that never lie? We all tell small lies. I wonder. I don't think everyone is like that. There must be couples who don't lie. No, there aren't. Or they have given up on each other and can't be bothered to lie. Compared to them, your case is much better. - It's not. - It is. You're asking too much. - You're too strong-willed. - Why? Remember, you skipped school because you didn't like your hairdo. You wore the skirt which was banned at school. That was the old days. You haven't changed. You want everything your way, from the skirt to your husband. You're selfish. Yes? - Oh, hello. - Hello. Is your husband well? Can I speak to you for a moment? - What is it? - I need some money. Why? Give me the bank book. It's good to see you happy. Here you go. Excuse me. Oh, wait! Wait! What is it? - Show me. - Oh, ah, this? Behave and go home. Your husband is nice. - Oh, not always. - Really? Yours is nice, as well. You just ask too much. - It's not true. - It is. You complain a lot, but it's because you love him. - I don't love him. - You do. Otherwise, you would have divorced ages ago. - You don't understand. - Understand what? My feelings. I do. You don't. I'm leaving. It's still early! Yes? - What is it? - Master is waiting for you to dine. I'm coming. She's coming. Hm... Can you start serving, please? I'm hungry. Yes, sir. Oh, welcome home. Aren't you eating? Darling. What? Don't eat in such a manner. Oh... I've forgotten. Is this the way you always eat? Is that right, Fumi? Does he always eat like a dog? Say yes. I do, when you're not around. I've told you I don't like it. Yes, you have. I was absent-minded. Please stop. I will. I was careless, pouring miso soup over rice. I've been told off. - Do your folks pour soup over rice? - We do. - Aren't you from Saitama? - Yes, I am. We do it in Nagano, as well. But not in Tokyo? It's good, though. Do you do it here? No, I don't. - Why not? - Madam doesn't like it. I see. Who is it? It's me. Do you want dinner? No, thanks. Where is she? She's taking a bath. Tell her to come upstairs after her bath. Yes, sir. - Fumi! - Coming! Did you call me? Hello. Sit down. No. Just tell me. You're in a bad mood. No, not really. - Sit down. - No, it's OK. I'm sorry about what I did. I didn't realise you'd hate it so much. - I'll stop. - It doesn't matter. No, I won't do it. I've always done it since I was a kid, so I did it without thinking. I didn't think it was wrong. I'm not saying it's wrong. No, but I'll stop it. But why is it always like this? What do you mean? Well... Cigarettes, for example. You don't like the Asahi brand, but I like it. Not only because it's cheap, but for me it tastes good. And trains... You don't like me getting in third class, but I like it. I can relax. It's the same way that I like Asahi. I had it for a long time and feel comfortable. That all goes back to how I grew up. Sorry, but it's not the way I was raised. It's about me. You can stay as you are. It'd be odd if you smoked Asahi. Everyone has a different style. In my case... what shall I say... something intimate and primitive... I like being casual, at ease. You do. Of course I'll get on a plane, if I'm in hurry. I would travel first class, if it's necessary. I've heard enough. OK, I'll stop. You may not like it, but I like to live comfortably. I do, too. I'll do things as I like. I'll travel first class, as I've always done. I feel comfortable that way. Hey, I still have something to... - That's enough! - Listen... The train will arrive in Hamamatsu in five minutes, at 12:20. The platform will be on your left. We'll stop there for five minutes. We will arrive in Nagoya at 14:04, Kyoto at 16:22, Osaka at 17:00. The president wants you. OK. You called me, sir? Oh, yes. We booked a flight to Uruguay for the day after tomorrow. I see. Will you be ready? It's such short notice. It's fine with me. Good. So will you go first, then? Yes. We have documents at the Admin office. Sorry about this short notice. I'll do it. Wait... Take the rest of the day off to prepare. Thanks. How about lunch tomorrow? We'll talk then. Excuse me. Welcome home. - Where is she? - Shortly after you left... - She went out? - Yes. She told me to hand this to you when you're back. "For a while, I'll do as I wish..." Did she say when she'd be back? In four to five days... I see. A telegram, please. My number is 1025. That's right. To Takako Satake, in Kobe, Suma. C/o Hideko Murayama 32 Rikyu Road. That's right. The main text: "I have business." Yes... that's right... "Come home immediately." From Mokichi. That's all. Yes, send it now. Thanks. Fumi! I'm going abroad. Bring me the suitcase. Yes... What about Madam... I sent her a telegram. Take the case out. The one that looks like this. I wonder what happened. She should be here by now. She didn't make it. Oh, the corporal is gone. I'm glad it's such nice weather. Shall we wait a little longer? Maybe. You can go home. I'll stay for a while. But she should be home soon. - Did your folks wire her as well? - Yes, yesterday. She had plenty of time. Yes. How thoughtless. What's she doing? Oh, here she is! Welcome home. Welcome home. You're late. I'm back. What have you been doing, Auntie? - You're so late. - Uncle's already left. What have you been doing? Uncle looked so Ionely. - Didn't you see the telegram? - Yes, I did. Why did you go to Suma? Because I wanted to go. You should have come back earlier. I wasn't in. I was out at Kobe with Shizuko. Everyone was worried because you didn't come. It was impossible. I didn't know. You say so, but he wired you the day before yesterday. - Didn't you see it? - I did. So why not come home then? I didn't know what "business" was about. It's his fault for phrasing it that way. A telegram means urgent. You should have come home. You could have made it. That's enough. Alright. If it's OK with you. I'm fine. You're sure, right? - I'm going home. - Me, too. Goodbye. Goodbye. Fumi! Didn't Master say anything? Not especially... Who is it? Master is back. It's fine. Go to bed. Welcome home. Well. The plane had a problem. Really? I heard you're going to Uruguay. Yes, to Montevideo. What was wrong with the plane? After two hours, they had engine trouble and came back. I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm exhausted. What time are you leaving? 9 a.m. When did you come back? Two hours after you'd left. How was Suma? Was it fun? I wouldn't do it again. Do what? Going away without telling you. It's fine. It's your style. No, I won't do it. I read your telegram. But I didn't understand what it was about. Oh, I'm sorry about that. It was so sudden. Didn't you know about it? There was a plan, and I was trying to tell you. But you've been in bad mood for a while. You should have told me. I didn't know it would be so sudden. Were you up early this morning? - Are you sleepy? - No... but hungry. Do you want something? Yes. I'll eat as well. So, let's go downstairs. Aren't you cold? No, I'm fine. We shouldn't wake Fumi up. No... but do you know where things are? Things? - Rice bowls, chopsticks... - We can find them. Let's go. OK. Do you want bread? - I want rice with green tea over it. - Ochaduke? I found pickles. They're for the maids. Are they? How about this? No, Ochaduke. Oh, I found rice. Is this enough? That's fine. We need pickled vegetables. Yes. Someone's talking in their sleep. It must be Yone. Where's the pickles paste pot? Here it is. Shall I do it? I'll do it. Oh, I found it. What vegetable are they? I don't know. - Careful. - Don't worry. Give me the bowls, please? Thank you. Hey... is this everything? Small plates? And soy sauce. Thank you for carrying. Take the rice. Thank you. It's delicious. I'll have the same. My hand smells of pickles. Let me see. It's the smell of working hands. It's delicious. It's good. What's the matter? What is it? I'm sorry. For what? How I've been behaving... Why? I didn't understand. I'm sorry. You said... intimate, primitive, and comfortable. I understood it, just now. Oh, forget about what I said. No, it's very important. How silly I was. Don't worry. It's OK. I'm glad you understand it. Go on, eat. It's like Ochaduke. The flavour of Ochaduke. It represents married couples. That's right. I didn't know it, till now. It's fine. I'm glad I came home tonight. I'm so glad... you came home. Don't worry. I'm happy you understood. - Your husband left today? - Yes. - Setsuko, did you go to see him off? - No. - Oh... - It was only me. I was the only one to see him off. - How was it? - I didn't cry. Really? Good for you. I cried when it was my turn. But there was something else. When he came home late, we had Ochaduke together. With him? Yes. After we ate, I cried. Oh, how unusual. Did you cry aloud? Or quietly? Quietly at first, then burst out later. I apologised for many things. He told me not to say anything. But I wanted to. In the end, he said, "I know!" and covered my mouth. Did he... I noticed his eyes welling up. I said, "Don't cry, you're a man!" Then he went, "Don't you understand? I'm happy." "This is the happiest day "since I married you." I said, "I've been so stupid." "I'm sorry. Now I understand it for the first time." And I apologised, crying hard. Then I felt wonderful, my body became lighter. Setsuko, are you alright? Why? - Isn't it time? - Yes, let's go. Please stay. Men are complicated. Women only know them at home. He might look like a relaxed turtle at home. But outside, he might be racing with rabbits. Women know only one side of men. That's true. You called him a turtle, or Dull-san. Well, I did. I was surprised that he knew everything about Shuzenji. - What did he say? - "If you lie, do it better. "Bad truth is better than good lies. "Because I wouldn't have to worry." That worries me. I should go home. - Why? - I told a lie to come here. - Goodbye. - I'm going, too. - What about Setsuko? - She's OK. I'm going, too. Non-chan is waiting. He'll treat me. Sit down. Let him wait. - See you. - See you. - Do you understand? - About what? Think carefully when choosing your husband. It's about your life. It's not about his tie or his fashion sense. It's not about those things. What shall I say... how reliable he is, as a man... That's most important. I didn't know that. But now, I like everything I used to hate. I couldn't find a better husband. What's so funny? Don't be arrogant. Listen to me. Yes. Ah, I wonder... what he's doing in Uruguay. That's the end of my story. Oh, Auntie! I'm going. Goodbye. - Stay for a while. - It's too much! Oh, how interesting. - She's fallen in love with him. - Madly. Interesting! She's right. It's not about the tie or fashion sense. Mine is second-hand. Someone gave me this, too. So what? Clothes are not important. Men are about reliability. Are you reliable? - Yes. - I wonder. There's no doubt about it. You've only seen me relaxed. What you know is only a part of me. How arrogant! I don't like it. Even if you don't like it, you'll find it out later and regret it, I can predict. Setsuko-san! Setsuko-san! THE END
