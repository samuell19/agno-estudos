And can you believe it? I get to spend all summer snorkeling with Daniela. Oh, I've missed her so much. But don't worry, I promise to bring some cool shells back from Australia so we can finally do a bit of redecorating in there. Aw, I'll miss you too. Off I go. Is there somebody in here? Is there something in here? Are you with me, Tedheads? My gut says we're not alone. I knew it. Uh, if there is a spirit present, please announce yourself. Great. Uh, thanks. And please, know that I come in peace. Whoa! What happened? I did tell you this part of the tour was optional, right? There was, uh... I, um... Listen... Uh, look, I-I saw… um… There was a lizard. A-And it was… huge! - And really mean. - Mmm. But there's something else in there. More than just a lizard. I-I can feel it. - Mm-hmm. - Me too. Is it your phone? Cool. If we come back in a week the lizard might have its own lifestyle blog. "Life lessons with Lizzy." "Ten life changing tips for how to catch flies." Hey, we should head back and shower. - Quinn's gonna be here soon. - Okay. I'll meet you two there. Thanks for the tour, Daniela. I can find my way back from here. Sure thing. See you in a bit. Mm-hmm. All right. Getting my phone and going home. Getting my phone and... Whoa-oa-oa! Time for me to unplug a bit anyway. What brings you to Dolphin Bay? I'm here for an internship at the Center for Marine Biology with my best friend, Daniela. - Yeah, she moved here last year. - Oh, who runs that place now? - Daniela's dad, Charlie. - Oh. He's a world-renowned marine biologist. He inherited a research center here on Dolphin Bay - from his old mentor. - Uh-huh. Daniela and I are going to be his interns for the summer. Sounds like fun. And look! Here's Dolphin Bay. ♪ Give me gray and gold Lighten up my soul ♪ ♪ Burning harder Never gonna let this go ♪ ♪ Paint the road like a story told ♪ ♪ Shining brighter Never gonna let this go ♪ ♪ I live my life in ♪ ♪ I live my life in color ♪ ♪ I live my life in ♪ ♪ I live my life in color ♪ You must be Quinn. Indeed I am. Ah, nice to finally meet ya. My name's Nate, I'm the groundskeeper here. I live just down there in that cottage. Th-This place is amazing Yeah, glad you like it. Uh, come on in. Daniela and the other interns are expecting ya. Other interns? Wow. Welcome. What do you think? Oh, it's great. So through here you're gonna... Um, who's Eyebrows McGee? Oh, that's Mr. Everly Fallow. He built this house in the 1920s. His daughter, Wendy, sold the place and all of its furnishings to my granddad back in the '70s. Wait, y-your grandfather was Dr. Martin Watts? The one and only. Anyway... He-He's like a founding father of modern marine biology. Uh, you-you-you grew up here? With-With him? Sure did. Yeah. I mean, Charlie owns it all now. I just look after the place. Whoa... Wow. Okay. I have so many questions for you. First of all, what's it like being scientific royalty? Overrated. Second of all, is it true Dr. Watts had a pet octopus named Dmitri? - Third of all... - How about, we talk about him another time. Yeah. Uh, okay. I-I-I'll see you tomorrow. Those brows could really use a tweeze, don't you think? Hey, Daniela! Quinn! - You got taller. - And so did you. Your hair is so long now. Is that a goat wearing a necklace? Oh, yeah. It's from our spring charity event. Isn't it adorable? Hi, Quinn. Quinn, this is Jennifer. She's my best friend. From my new school. Remember how I told you I ran for student council vice president, - and I won? - Yeah. Well, Jennifer's the president. She's the one who encouraged me to run for it in the first place. Oh. Wow. Yeah, we organized the petting zoo together. It was... It was a sensation. It was so amazing. Yeah. We should probably take turns wearing the shirt though. But it's so cute. A-Are you here for the day on official school business or something? She's going to be interning with us this summer. Mm-hmm. Oh. That's… fantastic. Yeah. Come on. I'll give you the tour. Mmm, perfect. And here's your room. Wow! Check out that view. It's not bad, huh? We're just right across the hall. You two are rooming together? Yeah, well, two of us had to double up. And I wanted you to have the view. Here, take some time to unpack. - We'll see you in a bit? - Yeah. See you later, I guess. Welcome to the party. Ah, forgive me. Theodore Wellington. At your service. But you can call me Teddy. And I'm Quinn. Are you an intern too? Mmm. H-How many more are there? Oh, dozens. It's a verifiable army. Just kidding. There's only four of us. Oh. So, Quinn, tell me everything. Where are you from? - Outside of Savannah. And you? - Ah. Well, how much time do you have? I'll give you the abridged version then. I was born in Melbourne, but I moved to London when I was young, and now I go to boarding school… …in Switzerland. Ah, I see you packed the essentials. Yeah, my parents are clowns. Uh, l-like, literally. Th-They're always playing jokes. Well, my parents are diplomats. Clowns sound a lot more fun. Wow, Teddy, take a hint. I'm sorry, it's just... You know, long flight. I need a nap. Oh, of course. You must be knackered. Uh, I'll see you in the lab. Look at you all, beaming at me in your lab coats. This is just... I... I gotta say it. This is truly squad goals. - Dad. - Yeah? Please don't say, "squad goals." - Why not? - Just don't. Okay. Squad goals aside, I think it's fairly important for all of you to realize that you've arrived here at a very critical time in Dolphin Bay's history. So Dolphin Bay Reef out there, the very backbone of the marine ecosystem that we have here, it's in grave danger. So we have been measuring the biodiversity of that reef for the last year, and we have found out that the biodiversity has actually dropped by a full 10%. All the species that we have here are so interconnected and interwoven that the loss of even just one could have a cataclysmic impact on the health and the well-being of all the other species surrounding it. Maybe think of it like an old sweater. There's a thread hanging off it, you pull that thread, starts to unravel. Dolphin Bay is unraveling very fast. Even the dolphins are starting to leave, and wha-what is Dolphin Bay without dolphins? Yeah? Well, I suppose it would just be called Bay. Did I just say that out loud? - Yeah. - Man. It was dead. - Didn't seem like it. - Oh. That was delicious, David. Best snapper I've ever had. Yeah, Pops. You've outdone yourself. - Aw, please. - What's your secret? Uh, good olive oil, sustainably caught snapper, of which there is an abundance locally. - He's also avoiding working on his book. - That is true. - I love the tortured artist. - Mmm. Ah, but time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time. Okay, ten points to Teddy. Very good. A-plus for you. Thanks. Psst, I brought my Ouija board if anyone's interested in taking a trip to the other side, hmm? Uh, I also brought Settlers of Catan. Oh, I love Settlers of Catan! Maybe some other time, Teddy. The girls and I actually have some work to do tonight. Rain check it is. Cheerio, ladies. For our fall charity event, we're gonna be doing a battle of the bands. We have ten slots to fill, and we've already received 30 submissions. So, it's time to start narrowing down. First up we have Taco Tuesday. That's really good. You like this? - Yeah, it's edgy. - Yeah. - It's very transgressive. Mmm. - Mmm. - He's a little off-key. - Well, yeah, - that's what's so cool about it. - Yeah. If it's not K-pop, Quinn's not interested. What's wrong with K-pop? I mean, we love BTS. Is it him? Who? It's him, isn't it? Who? I knew he'd text you back. Who? Hey, will someone please answer me? I sound like a great horned owl. Oh, well, his name's Tommy. He's the smartest guy in our grade. On the last day of school, he put his number in Daniela's phone and she texted him this morning. And he just answered. Exciting, isn't it? Riveting. Well, what did he say? He said, "Hey." No way. That's it? Okay, wait a few hours to respond. Trust me. Okay, well, uh, next up we have… Come in. That's quite the getup. Oh, it was custom-made. And monograms never go out of fashion. That's-That's great. Uh, may I? Can I ask you something, Quinn? Are you a believer? A believer in what? The spirit of adventure. The power of a good mystery! The pull of the supernatural. Oh, I-I-I'm a scientist, Teddy. I believe in rational thought and tangible evidence. Oh, but, Quinn, our two modes of thinking are not, by any means, mutually exclusive. Now that we've gotten to know one another… - Mmm, we have? - …I feel like I can be honest with you. Okay? I'm not spending this summer at Dolphin Bay because I have a particular interest in marine biology. Well, I'm not not interested, it's just not the reason I wake up in the morning. Okay, why are you here then? To search for buried treasure. Really? Oh. I should get back to my book. This is real, Quinn. 200 years ago, my great, great, great, great-grandfather… Wait, that's-that's not right. Um... My great, great, great, great, great, great-grandfather, Henry Wellington, perished in a shipwreck right off the coast of Dolphin Bay. He was a storied explorer and treasure hunter who vanished during his first solo expedition. A chest of priceless family heirlooms went down with the ship and, though the wreck itself washed away centuries ago, my family believes that the treasure remains around here, somewhere. Many have tried and failed to find it. Now it's my turn. I'm not going home empty-handed. Now, every treasure hunter needs a first mate. So, Quinn Perkins, what do you say? Will you be my partner in adventure? Wha... What evidence do you have that the treasure actually exists and isn't just the stuff of family lore? I've seen the ship's manifest. - With your own eyes? - With my own eyes. I'd show you a photo, but, uh, I left my phone in a cave. Well, there was a lizard. - A lizard? - Yeah. Uh, it's a... it's a long story. I'll think about it. Ah! In case you're interested in familiarizing yourself with my work in the meantime. Thank you. At your service. What's a Tedhead? Well, you have to admire his resolve. Mmm. Mmm. Did something bite you? I know first aid. I forgot to text Tommy back. I played it so cool, I forgot to text him back. Daniela, the key is waiting. Long enough so that you don't seem overeager, but not too long, otherwise you'll seem uninterested. Yeah. How do you not know that, Daniela? - It's like texting 101. - Exactly. - Thank you, Quinn. - She's being sarcastic. - O-Oh. - I fell for it again. Text him back. Now. Well, what should I say? Or we could go snorkeling. - I don't know. Have I ruined it now? - No you haven't ruined it. It's fine, um... - Have I screwed it up? - No, no, no, you're fine. Um, say… That's what he said. What are you reading? Treasure Island. How very appropriate. Just getting myself in the mood. Uh, have you given my proposal any thought? Look, Teddy, it's nothing personal, I just... I'm here for an internship, not a treasure hunt. And, statistically speaking, you're more likely to be struck by lightning than to find buried treasure. My cousin, Augustus, was struck by lightning. Twice. Nothing's impossible, Quinn. But it's all hunky-dory. I respect your decision. Great. Snorkeling? Hmm, not today.

I saw so much coral and reef sharks and stingrays. Oh, and a dolphin. It came so close. It was amazing. This place is incredible. And check out this shell I found. Don't you think Rusty and Skip will love it? - Um… - Who are Rusty and Skip? - They're my fish. - Your fish? Yeah, my pet fish. Are you being sarcastic this time? I-I can't tell. - No. - Unfortunately, no. Unfortunately? Quinn, I'm sorry. Rusty and Skip will totally love that shell. It's perfect. Now you notice. So, why couldn't you say that in front of Jennifer? And why did you wait until I got here to tell me about her? I tried to tell you about her. So many times. I just... I just want things to be how they were. I know, Quinn. Things change all the time and so do people. 1821. 1821! Remember that thing I said about only believing in tangible evidence? Of course I do. I have an amazing memory. A coin. From 1821. Is that from the… Just now? This is exactly as it was described in the manifest. Well, there must be hundreds more where this came from. I think lightning just struck, Teddy. You know what this calls for, don't you? Yeah! Dance with me, Quinn. I don't dance. We'll work on that. Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Let's have ourselves an adventure. Whoo! And action. Hello, Tedheads. Oh, boy. Have I got some news for you. Those familiar with my show... Thanks for watching... Know that I'm spending the summer interning at the Dolphin Bay Center for Marine Biology, but that I'm really here as an undercover adventurer searching for buried treasure. Wait, why am I whispering? I-I'm all over the place, guys. Forgive me. I'm just very excited because… Look. That's right. It's a coin from Henry Wellington's wreck. My new best mate, Quinn, found it. But, uh, she's camera shy and opted not to appear in today's episode. My gut says there's much more treasure to be found. Take a look. Between the shipwreck and where the coin was discovered, Quinn and I have a lot of ground to cover. And oh, boy, Tedheads, are we going to cover it. Until we meet again, stay curious, my friends. Um, Teddy, I think you're still rolling. Nailed it. So… - What is it? - I've been thinking… Mm-hmm. Look, I know we still have a lot of work to do on the battle of the bands… - Mm-hmm. - …and I know it's a little early to start planning in earnest, but I think I wanna axe a holiday dance. It's a bold move, but I'm listening. What if we do a carnival instead? - Mmm, that's cute. - Yeah, who doesn't love carnivals? Quinn, for starters. You know, I didn't mean to upset her earlier. I just genuinely couldn't tell if she was kidding about that pet fish thing. - I hope she's okay though. - Yeah, don't worry, it's not you. I should make more of an effort then. You know, try make her feel more included. Yeah, you can, but Quinn just likes things to be a very certain way. You know, she's not very big on change. - Okay, back to the carnival. - Okay, so… …and that is how the moray eel got its spots. - No. No. - Wow. Ah. - Huh? - Wow. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Dolphin Bay After Dark presents, Nate Watts. You've all seen the portrait that hangs near the front entrance of the house, right? You mean Eyebrows McGee? Now known as Eyebrows McGee, but he once went by the name of Everly Fallow, and he built the house you're living in. I love where this is going. Now, Everly Fallow moved to Dolphin Bay a hundred years ago in search of buried treasure. Oh, my. - The Wellington family treasure. - Yes. Which legend says was lost off the coast of Dolphin Bay two centuries ago. It was! Thank you for confirming that, Mr. Wellington. Oh, you're welcome. I'm loving this. Continue. Now, Everly dedicated his entire life to searching for this treasure, and it drove him mad! The locals used to wonder, "Does this man ever sleep?" Night in, night out, they'd see him wandering along the shoreline, pacing back and forth, muttering to himself about the lost riches that forever evaded his greedy grasp. Everly passed away 50 years ago, and his bodied is buried up in the cave. But when the moon is full, some say you can see his ghost wandering around Dolphin Bay searching forever for a treasure he'll never find. You heard it too. I bet it's Everly. Ghosts aren't real, Teddy. Then why do you seem so scared? I'm not. Good. Good. Good. - Good. - Because neither am I. We should investigate. Definitely. You go first. Wow. Didn't Ms. Rational Thought just say she doesn't believe in ghosts? I don't believe in ghosts, but I do believe in strange noises. How can the sound be coming from downstairs if there is no downstairs? So, there we all are, screaming our heads off. They think I'm the ghost of Everly Fallow. That's true. We didn't even realize there was a downstairs. Well, it used to be Everly's library. It's my office now. - Ah. - It's filled with all these old books. You know, it's very inspiring. Well, sorry to have spooked you guys with that little ghost story last night. It's just a local legend, nothing to worry about. Perhaps it isn't a tall tale at all, Nate. Perhaps it's real. Uh, not that I think ghosts are real or anything, okay? But you were very convincing. - Yeah. - Nice one. - Aw, thanks, Teddy. - Yeah. Maybe I missed my true calling to become an actor. Or at the very least, a podcast host. Anyway, hey, as a man of science, can I assure both of you that there is no ghost haunting this property? And also, ghosts aren't real. Except when it's a full moon. Teddy, I don't mean for this to sound, like, snide or anything, but you're awfully sensitive to ghost stories for someone who wants to make a career out of solving mysteries. That's a true observation, Daniela. You're absolutely right. I'm terrified of the unknown, which is precisely why I'm drawn to unsolved mysteries. And I think there's no greater unsolved mystery than that of the great beyond. I think facing your fears is a very important part of living. You know, the more you understand something, the less scary it becomes. And that's why I do what I do. I think that's wonderful, Teddy. And, for the record, Quinn was just as scared as I was last night. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Well, that's not surprising. What? You change the channel every time a Lucky Charms commercial comes on. Oh, no, but tha-tha-that's different. Leprechauns are creepy. What? Mammals aren't supposed to have such tiny hands. Aren't they? Well, I guess everyone knows now. - Thanks, Daniela. - Well… Leprechauns. It's day two, and I am beyond excited to announce your first official task as summer interns. - Beach cleanup! - You mean, picking up trash? Yes! Yes, exactly. Come on. It's all about paying our dues. And I promise you that it's all in keeping with a much larger scientific point. 'Cause it's not just the oceans that are suffering right now. It's our beaches as well. They're being inundated by tons of trash from fishing vessels, cruise liners, everything. So, on behalf of all creatures that call Dolphin Bay their home… thank you for your service. Have fun. Hey, um, sorry about the leprechaun slipup. Yeah, that was a secret. Honestly, it's more endearing than it is embarrassing. You should just own it. Noted. I don't like all this tension between us, Quinn. Oh, really? You just don't understand how hard it is to start over. I-I do though. Hey, you left a-and I had to start over. That's not the same thing. I moved to a foreign country. And I started high school without my only friend. I-I-I... I feel like I was in a foreign country. But you weren't. Look, Jennifer really took me under her wing and I'm grateful to her for that. Like, this place is finally starting to feel like home. So why can't you just be happy for me? Because you've replaced me. Hey, guys. I'm the creature from the black lagoon. Get it? Just forget it. Hmm, wait, hold on. All right, so we'll start here, yeah? I reckon that snorkeling makes everything better. You cover the northern half and I'll cover the southern half. Easy-peasy. Deal? - Uh, you got a little… we... - What? - S-Seaweed. up. - There? No? - Up. Like... No. - There? There. Oh, this? Well, I was just saving it for later. I've always wanted to photosynthesize my own dinner. - Delicious and nutritious. - Mm-hmm. Let's do this. - ♪ Hey ♪ - ♪ Outside the box ♪ ♪ Outside the lines ♪ ♪ We've always been a little different ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ I never dreamt we'd come this far ♪ ♪ Yeah, it sure took a while, didn't it? ♪ ♪ We are, we are, we are We are the dreamers ♪ ♪ We are, we are, we are Way up high ♪ ♪ So, honey, don't look down ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're living now ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ 'Cause we are, we are, we are We are the dreamers ♪ Hey, Tedheads, who ordered the escargot? ♪ We are, we are… ♪ Uh-oh.

Who wants to play a game of… Ocean Warriors? I have work to do on my next draft, so you guys knock yourselves out. So David is out, apparently, and Nate is yet to surface from his cottage, so… anybody else? Sorry, Dad, we have so many band submissions to review. Mmm, the submissions keep pouring in. Mmm. Quinn and Teddy, will you be lending your ears to the cause? Yeah, you guys are welcome to join us. Actually, uh, Quinn and I have important treasure hunting business to attend to. - Okay. - S-Sorry, treasure hunting? Mmm. Oh, it's just a little side project. Okay. Just make sure it doesn't become a distraction. You know, Teddy, I am starting to feel a bit distracted, and that worries me. A treasure hunt isn't what I came here to do. This internship is really important to me. Are you bailing on me? I don't know. I might be. It's just that, Everly Fallow searched his whole life for the treasure and found nothing, and we're here for a day and found an amazing coin. Why can't we just take that as a win and move on? Well, you see, it's… because the treasure has nothing to do with it. For me, at least. What's it about then? I have three older brothers. I'm the youngest, and my parents don't take me as seriously as they take my brothers. And this whole treasure mystery has haunted my family for so long, and I figured if I could be the one to finally find it, maybe they'll finally take me seriously. You know, maybe they'll finally be… proud. I... I-I totally get it. You do? You know what, Teddy? After much thought, I've decided that a treasure hunt sounds like a very worthy distraction. Mmm, I'm thrilled to hear you say that, Quinn. Onwards and upwards. Do you hear that? What is it? Davy Jones's locker. Look over there. Remember, Everly's buried in there. Then it has to be his ghost. There must be an explanation for… It's the coin. He wants the coin. Ghosts aren't supposed to be real. Quinn, we gotta go. Okay, okay. What do we do? We don't lose our cool. Not yet. Quinn, a vengeful treasure hunting ghost just appeared before our very... Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Teddy, you're jumping to some major conclusions based on very little evidence, which is not super scientific of you. Like, how do you know he's vengeful? Ma-Maybe he's friendly. That's what I'm going to choose to believe until there's ample evidence that proves otherwise. Now breathe. Hey, there you go. Do you have enough tangible evidence to believe in ghosts now? What can I say? There's no better evidence than what you could see with your own eyes, and I'm pretty sure we just saw a ghost. In all my years, I've communicated with ghosts, but I've never actually seen one. That was a first for both of us. How do you feel? I'm terrified. And excited. It appears we've found ourselves a ghost portal, so we're in uncharted territory now. Okay. My phone. Tommy wants to meet for ice cream tomorrow. And he said he can bring Jack and we can make it a double date. Already? Mmm, what are you gonna say? What should I say? Um… Say, "I'd love to." Love? Yeah, you're right. Say, "That sounds fun." With a winky emoji? - No emoji. - Okay. Perfect. Sent. It's great to see it's not just me who's excited about coming to work today. Every great adventure into the scientific unknown begins with one thing. A hypothesis. Now, a hypothesis is like a prediction. It's like an explanation for the unexplainable. So, what I wanna know is if anybody here has a hypothesis about what is going on in the bay. Daniela, you can start. Um, climate change is heating the sea, which is killing the fish. Mm-hmm. Very good. Jennifer. Pollution is throwing off the water's chemical balance. Excellent. Good job. Quinn. The effects of overfishing out at sea is disrupting the food web. I like that one. Very good. And Teddy. A snag in the energy field between our world and the world of the great beyond has created some sort of cosmic ripple effect that's killing the fish. Or maybe, uh, the introduction of a new apex predator has made the place go all wonky. Yeah, we... W-We might do that one. Yeah. So how's the budget looking? - It's... It's okay. - Will we make… My hypothesis is that Everly is no Casper. He's miffed at us. I can feel it. And on what are you basing that hypothesis? Well, the fact that he has unfinished business. Or the fact that, as you so astutely put it, we found in a day what he spent his entire life searching for. Don't you think that might trigger him to wanna seek some sort of revenge? Hmm, he returned you cell phone. That doesn't feel like revenge to me. It feels like an act of service. Do you always have to play devil's advocate? It's the only way to encourage healthy debate. Well, fine. I know how we can settle this. I can't believe you travel with this. Uh, actually, y-yes, I can. Now, in order for this to work, we must proceed with the utmost seriousness, and we must, above all else, believe. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. But, do you believe? Yes, Teddy. I wouldn't have said this a few days ago, but I believe. Or at the very least, I'm choosing to believe. Okay, I'll take it. Touch your fingers to the dial. Careful. Careful. All right, slow. Is there a spirit present? Is it the spirit of Everly Fallow? Okay. Nothing we didn't already know. Everly, are you angry with us? Everly, are you after our coin? Okay, you were right. He's mad. - What do we do? - We give him his coin back. - Okay. - Come on. "We must go on, because we can't turn back." It's from Treasure Island. Let's go on then. Everly's tomb. Whatever you do, don't touch that lizard. They're everywhere. Noted. Be careful. All right, Everly, the coin is yours now. I always keep a spare shell on me, just in case. I respect that. Here you go, Eyebrows McGee. May you finally rest in peace. That should do it. Well, Tedheads, here's something I never thought I'd say. The treasure hunt is off. Though my... Tho... Though my ancestor… …Henry Wellington, was once the treasure's rightful owner, it appears that through the centuries, another soul claimed it as his own. His name is Everly Fallow. Everly spent his life searching for the coin Quinn and I found, and, oh boy, did his ghost let us know it. I'll tell you more about that one night when I've had a chance to process it. Okay. In any event, if we were to have kept the coin and kept up with our hunt for more, Quinn and I would have put our own safety, and the safety of others, in jeopardy. And no amount of gold or glory is worth that risk, so we've left the coin with Everly at his final resting place in the Dolphin Bay cave. So, the hunt rests for now. In the meantime, I'm going to take a brief hiatus. Until we meet again… stay curious, my friends. And cut. Hey, you'll find another way to make your parents proud. I know it. But, for what it's worth, I'm already proud of you. Mmm, you know your stuff, Teddy, and you're very brave. Thanks, Quinn. Guys, look! There's a dolphin. You know, if she could talk, she'd say she's really hungry. She's been searching high and low all morning for her favorite snack, and she just can't seem to find it. She's not ready to give up on Dolphin Bay just yet. That is why we are doing what we're doing. So what was that first step? Who can remind me what that first hypothesis was? Yeah? Elevated concentrations of heavy metals in the water could be having a deleterious effect on reef biodiversity, dwindling dolphins' food supplies and thus driving them away? Bang on. Well done, Quinn. So today we're going to collect some samples of sea water, coral and sediment from different locales around the bay, and tomorrow we're going to test those samples for the possible presence of those heavy metals. So, any questions? - Yeah? - Why are we in a rowboat? Yeah, that was a serious workout. It's all thanks to the work of Dr. Martin Watts. All motorized seafaring vessels, and that's jet skis, boats, anything, they were all banned in Dolphin Bay over two decades ago. That's strange. I just... I've seen a big boat out on the bay and it wasn't this one. You sure? Positive. I've seen it three times in the middle of the night, just sitting there. Maybe it was a ghost ship. You excited to see Tommy? I'm actually pretty nervous. Nerves are just excitement in disguise. It'll be fun. Trust me. I'm not delusional, Teddy. I know what I saw, and it wasn't a ghost ship. No one thinks you're delusional. Oh, Daniela does. And I saw a boat... No, I've seen a boat three different times. I believe you, and I reckon we'll find out what it's doing there soon enough. - How about we go to the beach? - Great idea. - He likes you. No, he likes you though. - What if he's changed? - We don't know that. They're coming. - It'll be fine... - Hey. - Hey. So, does anyone want ice cream? I think I'm gonna get strawberry, because strawberry's my favorite. I love it. It's just so fun. Um, I think I might get sprinkles. Actually, I don't... I don't think they have sprinkles. So, I won't get sprin... - What are... what are you guys gonna get? - Yeah, um, I'll get the same. Cool. - Cool. - So cool. Cool. Cool. Yeah. Cool. Should we get some ice cream then? - Yeah. - Yeah. The more I think about it, the more I worry that we haven't seen the last of Everly Fallow. At the end of the day, all we did was bury a coin in some dirt. - Yeah, but we... - I don't mean to belittle our efforts, but my hypothesis is that there's more to it. - Okay. - How do we test the hypothesis? That's the thing. It's a tough one to test. We don't know much about Everly. We need a sign to point us in the right direction. Give us a sign. - Teddy! - Argh. That was my first time trying honeycomb ice cream. Sorry. Sorry, I'll get you another one. Oh, man, I'm a bloody wreck today. What? - A sign. - I know. I just said that. - No, like, an actual sign. - I heard you the first time, Quinn. I... Across the street, Teddy. A give-us-a-sign sign. Look! Fallow's Antiques. Yeah. - It was so funny. - Yeah, it was funny. - Oh, how may I help you? - We're sorry to bother you, ma'am. We were just wondering, is this shop somehow connected to Everly Fallow? Everly Fallow was my father. So the legend is true? Well, my father came to live in Dolphin Bay, and yes he came in search of the Wellington family treasure, and yes he dedicated his life in the pursuit of that treasure, but he never found a thing. I loved the man, but he'd read Treasure Island just one too many times as a kid… …and it filled his head with ideas. Did he ever come close? To finding anything? Well, he claimed to. I mean, just before he died, he said to me, "Wendy, I found it." And I let the dolphins have it." I was never quite sure what he meant by that. Well, maybe it meant that he did come close. No, I wouldn't get my hopes up. He wasn't making too much sense by that stage. And I suppose your next question is going to be about his ghost. - Have you ever seen it? - Not once. Have you? Well, interesting. You don't believe us. No, it's not that. It's just that, so many people have seen him, and, well, I never have. I mean… …makes a girl feel a bit overlooked, you know? Well, after my father died, I sold every one of his belongings to Dr. Watts when he bought the house from me, but I just couldn't part with that journal. I found it hidden in his library. Who was Jim H.? Pardon? Uh, the last line. You know, "The rest is between me, Jim H. and God." I never figured that bit out. My father didn't know any Jim H.'s. Trust me, I did my research. That's really strange. Well, thanks for your time, Ms. Fallow. It was lovely to meet you. Of course, dear. Come back anytime. Oh, and if you do see my father, tell him I said hello. We certainly will. Yo, Tedheads. Do you know what time it is? Uh, night? Wait, what are you doing here? Charlie sent me to come pick you up. You missed dinner. Oops. Yeah, big oops. You wear many hats, Nate. Groundskeeper, storyteller, bounty hunter. Right. Let's, uh, get the bikes in the back of the truck, hey? Charlie is equal parts worried and furious. Oh, it's just so moving. We have to pick them. I love it. Are you okay, Quinn? I want to talk about our next move. What is it? We can't lose momentum. Well, I think the best thing we can do for ourselves right now is, um, rest. It'll keep us out of trouble, and hopefully we can get back in Charlie's good books. And how do you suggest we do that? My brain's moving at a thousand miles per second. Reading usually helps me. Uh, I-I don't feel like reading. I'll try to meditate. Have you ever meditated before? No. I mean, it can't be that hard. Um, I think you're supposed to get... - Shh! - Okay. - Davy Jones's locker! - What? Jim Hawkins! - Who's that? - The protagonist of Treasure Island, his name is Jim Hawkins. Wendy said her father read this book too many times as a kid. "The rest is between me, Jim H. and God." David's office. Everly's library. I'm on it. - Quinn. Well, I'm glad you're back safely. - Mmm. Is everything okay? Yes, sorry to bother you, David. It's just, I just finished my book and I need to start a new one. Do you mind if I grab something off the shelf? Oh, no. Of course. Come on down. Just, uh, watch your step. - It's pretty cool, huh? - Yeah. The personal collection of Everly Fallow. Most of these are first editions. - Uh, have you read them all? - Pretty much. It can be inspiring to read the classics. A little intimidating too, which is probably contributing to the old writer's block. Is there something in particular you're looking for? Oh, um… - this will do. - Great. Thanks, David. How's the writing going? Oh, well, I am currently researching gluten-free chocolate chip cookie recipes. So, not great. Ah. Thanks again. Good night. - No way. - Way. "If you're here, protect it." That's rather ominous. There's nothing here. It's just the book. Everly made a treasure map. Davy Jones's locker. And it's buried at the lighthouse. Come on, Quinn. It's past midnight. - Let me take over. - Never. There's enough epinephrine coursing through my veins to power a small city. I'm hulking out. I'll let you do the honors, Mr. Wellington. It can't be! There's just seashells. Uh, keep digging. It's a secret journal. "If you're here, you're about to learn the truth. A truth I couldn't bear to take to the grave with me." Tell me that was not a yawn. The adrenaline must be starting to wear off. - I'm crashing. - Don't you fall asleep on me. - The treasure is... - Ooh, give me a second. Okay, go on. The treasure is stuck in a cave beneath Dolphin Bay Reef. The wreck of Henry Wellington's ship settled on top of the mouth of a giant underwater cave. The treasure fell into that cave and debris from the ship blocked the entrance to it. Over the centuries, that debris helped anchor a new section of the reef and so, the only way to get to the treasure - is to destroy... - Destroy the reef. Exactly. Then that's what Everly meant when he said he let the dolphins have it. To him, the reef was the real treasure. He refused to destroy it. How does it feel? You just solved the mystery that's haunted your family for centuries. We solved it, Quinn! What an auspicious debut for us! You know what this calls for, don't you? Whoo! Whoa! Come on! ♪ Can't have my love ♪ Whoo! ♪ I think you're crazy Can't have my heart ♪ - Whoo! - Whoo! Good afternoon, Tedheads. I'm back, and I'd like to officially introduce you to Quinn, my partner in all things adventure. Lovely to meet you, Tedheads. This right here is Everly Fallow's secret journal, and it hasn't seen the light of day in nearly 50 years, and we found it beneath the foundation of what is now the Dolphin Bay Lighthouse. X marks the spot. - Whoo! - Whoo! Today is the day, ladies and gentlemen. Today, we test our first ever hypothesis. So, yesterday, we were out in the bay getting our samples of coral, sea water and sediment, yeah? Today, we are going to test those respective samples for the presence of these heavy metals. Let's do this. - ♪ Shout about it ♪ - ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Keep it coming ♪ ♪ I'm going out Nobody telling me nothing, no ♪ - ♪ Dress it up to the top ♪ - ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ It don't matter if you're showing it off Yeah ♪ ♪ Shake it, shake it Shake it down now ♪ ♪ Make it, make it We make a wild sound ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're wild But we're free ♪ ♪ And we're dancing The whole day long ♪ ♪ So wake up and get out And be free ♪ ♪ And keep moving it on ♪ ♪ Oh, whoa ♪ ♪ We make a wild sound ♪ So… what did we learn? That we were wrong. Did I just say that out loud? Yeah. We learned that the concentrations of each of the five metals are just within their normal ranges. Yeah. Meaning? Meaning our hypothesis was wrong and the chemical makeup of the water probably isn't what's having an effect on the bay's dwindling biodiversity. Yes! Yes. Guys, it is awesome to be wrong, because you're being pointed in the right direction to the right answer. Yeah, sure, it would've been nice to be right the first time. I get that. Don't be discouraged. Seriously, great work today. Teddy, I've been thinking. Uh-oh. If Everly Fallow died knowing where the treasure was, then there would be no reason for his ghost to roam the cove searching for it. But we both saw him. We both saw something. Maybe it wasn't a ghost. You don't believe anymore. Okay, let's not make this a referendum on whether or not I believe. I'm just following the facts. Come on. Wait for me. You think it was a person posing as a ghost? That's my new hypothesis. We had something they wanted, and they thought they'd scare us into handing it right to them. And we did hand it right to them. Someone's clearly been here. And now it's gone. How would they have even known it was here? Maybe they're a Tedhead. I mean, we literally showed them the map pointing right here. My followers really have been paying attention. I think it's safe to conclude then, in this case, there's no ghosts at large, hmm? Just a potentially dangerous criminal doing elaborate pranks. You think it's the same person that's driving the boat you keep seeing? Now my gut says yes. Ah, buh, buh. You stay right there. I'm watching you. - Oh. - Oh, you scared me. Just wondering where you were. Quinn, where's the journal? - It's in your room. - It's not in my room. It's gone. Where else could it be? Hey, was the house broken into while we were gone? What? Of course not. Did you see anyone go into my room? Well, I haven't been standing guard in the hallway. - Did anyone else come upstairs? - Just my dads. And Nate. - Nate? - Nate? Yeah. I saw him walking down the hall when I went to the bathroom earlier. - Upstairs? - Upstairs? Yeah. What? Yesterday, when Nate picked us up, he said, "Yo, Tedheads." I didn't think anything of it then, but... - Does he own a boat? - Yeah. Why? We need to go to the marina. Now. Nate is like family. He would never steal from us. I saw a boat the other night too. The same one you must've seen. I mean, it was just sitting there. Whatever's going on, she's not making it up. Uh, but if we're not back in an hour, please tell them, hmm? Teddy, that's the boat I've seen. It must be Nate's boat. - Is that a drill? - Oh, my gosh. He's going to destroy the reef. We've got to stop him. We must go on because we can't go back. Let's go on then. Can you figure out how the drill works? He's coming back. What do we do? Over here. Hurry up. Close it. - Pull, Teddy! Come on! - Come on! Hey! Hey, look. The coin. Y-You were right. It was never a ghost. Whoo! You really saw a boat? Quinn did seem pretty scared. But Nate, it just... It doesn't make any sense. Hey, I'll distract him, you find the drill's power source and cut it. I like that plan. Okay. One, two, three! Nothing's working! Give it up, Quinn! You ain't getting out. Nate, what are you doing? You know exactly what I'm doing. What would your grandfather think? He'd be angry. Which is the point. See, Quinn, I was next in line to inherit the research center. My plan was to sell it and use the money to finally get out of this place. But see, Granddad, he... He had other ideas. He thought the center would fall into disrepair if he left it with me. I guess… I guess, in his eyes, I wasn't enough. So he left everything to Charlie. Exactly. Well, everything except this… luxury vessel. And what have you been doing in the bay at night? I've seen your boat out there and I know you're up to something. I'm just doing a bit of fishing, Quinn. Yeah, figured I could ruin Granddad's legacy and make a bit of money for my travels. It's easy. I just pull exotic species from the water and sell 'em. Oh, those scorpion fish are worth a fortune. It sounds like you've been doing a bit of overfishing. For how long? Oh, about a year now. The reef is dying because of you, Nate! You're decimating its biodiversity! The ripple effect has been catastrophic! No wonder the dolphins are fleeing! No wonder the dolphins are fleeing! Sorry, Quinn, um, I didn't actually hear that. Can you repeat it? The engine is very loud. Actually, never mind. I'm sure it wasn't that important. Their phones keep going to voice mail. It's almost been an hour. That's Nate's boat. Go call the police and get my dads. Now! I'd just about made enough money from the fishing to leave the town and never look back, and then you two arrived. If Teddy hadn't posted about the coin on his stupid vlog… - It's not stupid. - Thank you. …I never would have realized the Wellington family treasure actually existed. I thought it was just a legend. So, I figured, if I could get my hands on that coin, sell it, then I'd be on the first flight out of here. Stealing it would have been too obvious. I mean, you two never let it out of your sight. Look. But when I realized how scared you two got over my little ghost story, I saw the perfect opportunity. I could bring the legend of Everly Fallow… …to life. By pretending to be his ghost. Exactly. Very good, Teddy. And it worked! You handed the coin straight to me, and today, as I was watching your terrible vlog, I saw you found Everly's secret journal, - which meant there was so… - Whoo. …much more to the story. Luckily for me, you left the journal in plain sight, which showed me exactly where the treasure was actually buried. So then I figured, why settle for just one coin, when I could have a whole chest of coins? Which leads us here. And now, the treasure will be mine and I can leave this town in the dust. Your grandfather dedicated his life to the bay, and you're destroying it for money. How could you do such a thing? It's really not that hard, Quinn. My grandfather chose the bay over me. So destroying it will be the cherry on top of the ca... The cherry on top of the what? Daniela! Quinn, I am so sorry I didn't believe you. It doesn't matter now. You saved us. You saved the reef. Quinn, I didn't... I didn't mean what I said before. Me too. But I acted selfishly and I'm sorry. I've just had such a tough time being... E-existing without you. And making new friends has been impossible, and when I got here and saw you with Jennifer, I couldn't help but feel replaced. No one could ever replace you, Quinn. It's a new chapter for us. Into the unknown we go. Together. And without fear. That was beautiful. Truly heartwarming. Hey! Nate Watts. You're under arrest for illegal fishing in an unauthorized area and the kidnapping of two minors. Keep your hands where we can see them. Nice try, ghost man. - Daniela! Are you okay? - Daniela, you okay? - Oh, goodness. - Yeah. - Quinn, are you okay? Not hurt? - Yeah. - Teddy, you all right? You sure? - I'm good. - I'm good. - Tell us what happened. Quinn, I should have spoken up earlier. I just didn't want to get in the way of whatever was going on between you and Daniela. You've done nothing wrong. I'm the one who refused to give you a chance, - and I'm so sorry. - It's okay. It's never too late, you know? I was hoping you'd say that. So, how about we go inside and listen to some amateur music? I hear the submissions keep pouring in, and I would love to lend my ears to the cause. Well, I'm in, but only if we can dance. That can be arranged. - Let's get to it then. - Yeah, let's do it. Squad goals. Am I right? Squad goals indeed. So, that's what he meant when he said he let the dolphins have it. Everyone had him all wrong, Ms. Fallow. He was so much more than a treasure hunter. He was a conservationist. My father, the conservationist. Thank you for solving the mystery. Oh, I want you to keep it. And I want you to keep this too. I thought you want your parents to have it, so they'd finally recognize... It's okay. I've realized that whether or not I make my parents proud, I'm enough. Our journey together has shown me that. Uh, Ms. Fallow? Yes, dear? Would it be okay if we came back and visited sometime? Anytime. You know what I can't stop thinking about? What? This one quote I love by Jacques Cousteau.
