[audience cheering] I don't know what music would be like if it weren't for the influence of Ozzy. Ozzy changed everything. Well, I mean, you can't say anyone's immortal, but I think that Ozzy in that time was, um... I think Ozzy's music is timeless. It makes me cry and gives me the chills. It's just perfect. Dad is a kid from the streets who... worked in factories. He's very much this working class blue collar guy. The working class thing is key because you grew up with nothing, and you do everything you can every day so you don't go back to nothing. It's all about escaping your reality to something better. He left one of the biggest rock bands in the world and became bigger, a credible artist on his own, finding great new talent, and then made it huge on TV. Nobody had done that. He is the most irresistible madman you will ever meet in your life. He is the real Iron Man. The reason why I do what I do is because it's what everybody wants to do, but they ain't got the guts to.

When my dad came home after working all night in a factory, my mother Lilian would start her shift. [whirring] I was petrified most of the time because I was a very nervous guy. Fear of impending doom ruled my life. I convinced myself if I stepped on cracks, something really bad would happen when I got home, like my mother would be dead or something like that. - [snoring] - When my dad was sleeping through the day, I would be freaking out thinking he was dead. I'd have to poke him to make sure he was still breathing. I can tell you, he wasn't too pleased about that. Where did you guys spend most of your time? In the street 'cause it was too crowded in the house. He didn't have a very happy school life. He was always penalized for... probably because he was so slow. I hated school. I spent more time smoking cigarettes in the boys' room than being in class. I wasn't good at school. Well, we didn't realize he was dyslexic. We just thought perhaps he was, like, slow to learn. There was a lot of shame for me, because if you had that learning disability, they would put you in a corner with a cone on your head, and they'd call you the class dunce, and the whole class laughed at you, which made me go further into me. ♪♪ I [bleep] hated it. ♪♪ Ozzy! - What's going on, Ozzy?! - Hi! All right. I was the class clown. I would go to the biggest guy in the class, make him laugh, and he would be my mate so no one would hassle me because I've got this big guy with me. Most comedians I know, offstage, they're very unhappy people, and that's kind of true to my life. I'm making you laugh to make me feel safe around you. At 16, I was on the streets. When John left school, he sort of went from one little job to another. I didn't want to work in a day job. I couldn't stand getting up for a job in the morning. I could never hold a 9-to-5 job down, ever. I'd go from a plumber to a builder. One of my jobs was working in a slaughterhouse. I remember gagging all day. But eventually, you get used to the smell. I said to this guy, "How long have you been doing this?" He goes, "35 years. I'm retiring, and they're gonna give me a gold watch." I remember turning to him. I said... I had to at least try and have a little bit of fun with my life while I was young. John used to go out and have a drink, get in fights, and that was it. From what I saw of John, he was always in and out of trouble. You know, Dad was always telling him off. That's the shop that I broke into. That was Mrs. Clark's shop I broke into. Yeah, I broke into a shop at the back of my house. A lot of the kids turned to crime, and I did for a time, but I wasn't really good at it, you know. I wasn't a career criminal. I kinda wanted to get caught in a way to be accepted by the rest of the bad guys in the area. I didn't wanna go to jail, but that's where I ended up. When you're in a place full of bad people, it's a bit of an education. One month in jail was long enough. I had no idea what my life was about to explode into. I had no idea. I gotta go for a piss.

I went to George Clay's music shop in Birmingham. He got me a Shure mic, a stand, and a 50-watt Vox P.A. I thought it was the best gift ever. If my father hadn't bought me that mic and P.A., I would definitely not be here now. First time I ever met Ozzy was at school. He was in a year younger than me. We all lived around the same sort of area. That first time I met Oz was with Geezer and Tony as well. We needed a singer for the band, so, uh, we went to this music shop in Birmingham where all the musicians used to hang out, and we saw this ad for "Ozzy Zig requires gig." [laughs] And, uh, the magic words... "has his own P.A." I said to Bill, "I know an Ozzy, but it can't be him, because as far as I knew, he never sang." Well, it wasn't that I was the greatest singer on the earth, but if you had an ad which said, "I own my own P.A.," you got people at your door. Myself and Tony and Geezer, we went to his house. I took to him straightaway. It was his personality and also his knowledge of blues music. I mean, he could really sing really good blues. So we all decided, "Oh, why don't we just form a band together and have a go, you know?" Then we did our first rehearsals not soon after. [drum beating rapid riffs] Nobody got any sleep. I mean, it was just... they were crazy days. They just like, you know, a bunch of guys together that are just having a lot of, uh, a lot of fun.

It beat [bleep] going to a [bleep] some industrial pollution [bleep] miserable job. At first, we just did blues stuff, like 12-bar blues. We just used to get together, jam for about two hours.

[screams] [suspenseful music plays] "Why don't we start writing scary music?" Somebody gave Ozzy this old 16th century book of black magic, and he brought it round to my flat 'cause he knew I was interested in magic and all that kind of thing, and I just got this really weird vibe off it.

At some point, we fired our manager. And once finally got tired of that management, we basically made all the decisions ourselves, which is what led the end of the band. They went bankrupt, and this, of course, caused turmoil within the band. My dad was a legendary manager in the industry. In '79, when Sabbath signed with my dad, they were mates of mine, Black Sabbath. I was touring with Electric Light Orchestra and other bands.

Tony was staying... he was either doing Quaaludes and blow all day, and they were saying that I was out of my head all the time. so it was kinda like the pot calling the kettle black in the respect that we were all stoned, you know? The conversations began about the possibility of looking at another singer. The decision was, if we don't, we're gonna break up. We got a situation that's supposed to be a band, but yet when it came to the firing of me, they got Bill, who was my best friend, to come and do the dirty deed. It was [bleep] horrible. Yeah, I hated it. You know, we'd all lived in unison. We'd all been the four musketeers. You know, so now what? I was done. They were done with me. I was done with them. It was just like a divorce.

We're here for you." I think he honestly thought that we were [bleep] and he'd be sent home. It was a very sad feeling. I remember leaving there. I locked myself in a hotel room for three months just getting smashed out of my brains every day, you know. I hadn't seen him for about a week, and I went to see him. He just drank and you know, ordered pizzas all day and watched TV and never left the room, feeling sorry for himself because he didn't believe in himself. And he was so down when I said, "What the [bleep] are you doing?" "Open the window. Get in the [bleep] shower. Shave that [bleep] off." And she said, "If you clean yourself up, I'll wanna manage you," and I said, "You wanna manage me? You're crazy." I thought my career was in the [bleep]pan, you know? Just because he'd got fired from Black Sabbath, the kids didn't care. They loved him. But as far as the industry goes, he'd got fired from one of the biggest rock bands in the world. He was an addict, so they wrote him off. I wanted to be more mainstream without selling out to the pop world. I wanted to be more accessible.

We worked so well together. Randy and I were like a team, you know. One thing that he gave to me was hope. He gave me a reason for carrying on. He had patience with me, which is great, and he was very good to work with, you know. He pulled the best out of you, you know. We had a lot of fun, lot of fun. We were lucky that my father financed Ozzy's solo career. He financed the album. It was done on a 24-track machine in a bar in England. It was a lot of fun. It was a lot of drinking, a lot of partying, and then an album came out of it. I was expecting an awful lot from Ozzy, but I wasn't expecting what I heard. He really can do it. [laughs] We had this brilliant album that was done in six weeks. "Blizzard of Oz," 'cause we were all doing cocaine. To sell this album, we eventually got a deal at Epic for $65,000, and we took it 'cause it was the only one that would take it. It came out in the UK first, and it was just instant hit.

No. We were really kind of thrown together, but it wasn't until August of 1980 that we actually had a relationship going. It was the last night of rehearsals, and we had two days before the tour was starting, and I thought, oh, it's gonna be the usual thing that had happened, in my past anyway, that, you know, you go with a bloke, you [bleep] him one night, and the next day doesn't know you. - So you know, like it was before. - [bleep]...chance over you. Oh, [bleep] off. No, it wasn't the perfect case scenario at all. Aside from recording and performing, - what do you like doing best? - Sex. Yeah, you know, he could have seen a guy in a [bleep] frock, he would have probably [bleep] it. That's just the way Ozzy was when he's drunk and loaded. I mean, some ugly, ugly people.

I was still married to my ex-wife, but I was... I fell in love with Sharon. We were just having the time of our lives, and meanwhile, Ozzy had a wife and kids back at home. So it was, you know, a lot. You could see that there was a chemistry. It kinda unfolded rapidly. But it wasn't something that it was... it was flaunted in front of everybody. It's hard enough working with someone, let alone being a partner with that person. Life's hard enough as it is without making it harder for everyone. I am Ozzy Osbourne. I've been a very extrovert person best part of my life. I suppose it's my way of saying to people, "Hey, I'm here." That's what a lot of people have picked up on me, the fact that I'm extroverted. I'm not your normal kind of rock 'n' roller, you know. So there was this boardroom meeting set up for the head of every department to meet Ozzy and I. What are we gonna do that they're never gonna forget? So we thought, all right, well, let's go in, and we'll get them doves of peace. Everybody loves doves. ♪♪ The dove was a total freak of nature, if you like. I was absolutely drunk, and I was being introduced to the L.A. branch of CBS. The original idea was that I had brought these two doves to throw up into the air when I walked in to make this sort of, like, joke, like, "I'm here." We'd been, you know, having a very happy morning. And everybody sees the dove, and they're like, "Oh, oh, oh." Ahh! [grunts and spits] Throw the carcass on the table. It was not a publicity stunt. I was just out of my [bleep] face on drugs and alcohol, you know. And everybody was like... [gasps] It just shocked the [bleep] out of everybody. They called the security.

As he's saying that, his album is going out to radio, and they're getting all these calls in from station managers saying, "This record's unbelievable. We're playing it 20 times a day." And then it just spread like wildfire. ["Crazy Train" guitar intro playing] The album went right into the charts. The reviews were unbelievable. Who doesn't love "Crazy Train"? It's just a classic. Everyone in America had an Ozzy album and knew of Ozzy, and it was just a miracle.

It was like one thing after another was a success, success. We had a lot of fun making them albums. "Blizzard" was still in the charts when we put out "Diary." I think "Blizzard" and "Diary of a Madman" were two of the finest albums that ever was made, you know. Ozzy solo was very different musically. The guitar styles were different, and the... the clothes were different. Everything about it was different. It was more... in tune with the times that it was made. It's a great feeling to have success with albums. It's what you all make a record for, and it's just a magic time. ♪ Over the mountain ♪ ♪ Take me across the sky ♪ So we went into arenas.

The craziest thing happened in Des Moines, Iowa. ♪♪ The bat was a kind of an accident, which I did milk somewhat. I always liked old movies where they used to have them custard pie fights. So it gave me this idea to throw, instead of pies, bits of meat and animal parts into the audience. I thought it was hilarious. We had this big hand come out at the end of the show that Ozzy was on, and then there was a catapult in the back full of raw meat that Ozzy would throw at the audience. And the catapult went, and everybody's covered in intestines and livers, and then people would come with, like, parts of animals, and they would throw raw chicken. Sheep's testicles and live snakes, dead rats, all kinds of things. Somebody threw this frog onstage... the biggest frog I've ever seen in my life, and it landed on his back. [woman screams] I was going hysterical. I thought it was a baby. [baby crying] And somebody threw a bat. I just thought it was a rubber bat, and I just picked it up. I put it in my mouth and crunched down. I just [bleep] bit into it, you know, being the [bleep] clown that I am. Oh, no, it's real! You know, it's a real, live bat. [groans] The bat. Bats are the biggest carriers of rabies in the world, and I had to go to the hospital afterwards, and they came and started giving me rabies shots. And I had one in each rear. And I had to have that every night. And it was on the news that Ozzy bit the head off a bat, and then it just spread like wildfire. There were stories that he will only go on if he killed so many kittens before he goes onstage. It got to the point where people expected me to do crazier and crazier things. People elaborate, and Ozzy Osbourne has been created through them, not through me. All I did was get up there and make a mistake of biting a head off a bat, and I tell you what, guys. It ain't fun when you get them rabies shots. If I was sober, I would never have urinated at the Alamo. ♪♪ Ozzy was on a bender. He'd wait for me to sleep and then slip out.

And he put on one of my dresses and goes down into the bar. The next day, they had to do photos. He kept my dress on, and they took him to where the Alamo was. So he just lifted his dress and took a piss. This cop turns up. "There he is!" And he got arrested. And of course, after that, he was banned from San Antonio. ♪♪ From what I did with a bat, the dove, the Alamo, and all the other [bleep], I suppose it's... it was in the spirit of rock 'n' roll. I don't know. I didn't mean any harm to any of it, apart from the bat, the dove, the... [laughs] It all happened so quickly. It was like a movie.

I remember we did a gig in Knoxville, Tennessee, and we were driving from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Orlando, Florida, to do a gig with Foreigner. And we must have got there about noon, and Ozzy and I stayed on the bus. Ozzy and I were sleeping in the back of the bus, and we got woken up by this huge, huge blast. Boom! In the background, there's like a big stately home blazing. I can't understand what's going on. It was like being in a nightmare, you know. Rudy, our bass player, was, like, screaming, "Get off the bus! Get off the bus!" We go and get out of the bus, and we had no idea still what was going on. I see the tour manager down on his knees, crying, "Randy, Rachel." I'm like... They go like that. And then there's part of the airplane sticking up through the house. They realized that they had been on a plane, and the plane had crashed. 1 or 2 inches lower, it would have crashed into the bus, and we would have blown up right there. I don't know what the hell happened that killed them, but everybody died on the plane. Randy Rhoads, the 25-year-old lead guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne's group was killed in a plane crash this morning along with two other people... the pilot of the plane, also Rachel Youngblood, the group's hairdresser. Ozzy Osbourne himself was in the tour bus when one of the plane's wings clipped it, but Ozzy escaped injury, we understand. 25-year-old Randy Rhoads is dead today. ♪♪ Randy was a gift from God for Ozzy. I mean, he was everything to Ozzy. I lost a dear friend in my life, and I miss him terribly. After the crash, I would say that it was a bigger job for Sharon to keep Ozzy not only from drinking or doing drugs, but to doing damage to himself. Ozzy still to this day feels guilty. "Yeah, if only I was awake, I would never have let him get on that plane," and, you know, it's something that Ozzy lives with. Every single show was a wake for our friend. ♪ I said, hey, goodbye to romance, yeah ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Goodbye to friends ♪ They'd forget that, you know. It just gets kinda weird. ♪ To all the past ♪ ♪♪ ♪ I guess that we'll meet ♪ ♪ We'll meet in the end ♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ I finally got divorced from my wife, and I wanted to marry Sharon. I loved her, and I didn't want to live without her. I wanted to start a new family. Ozzy wanted to get married. It was just never a big thing for me, marriage. Getting a successful album, tour, you know, those were the things that were important. It was never like, oh, you know, planning a wedding, unh-unh. Do you remember the first time you proposed to me? - No. - You do, too. I know I proposed, but I don't know where or when. - Do you remember the second? - No. - Any of them? - No. - Oh, [bleep] you. - I don't. I remember when I married you, I-I think. [chuckles] The first time he proposed to me, we were at my parents' house. He asked my father if he could marry me. So sweet. It was all very lovely, and, um, nice, and we were all excited, and then the first argument, he goes out the bloody window into the garden and lost the ring. Shaz, would you just bend over on your knees, please, darling, just for one sec? Oh, with that? Are you crazy? I wouldn't go near him with that. It'll end up in my back. His manager, Sharon Arden. She's the woman I've loved in my life. She's my soulmate. He is the most romantic man I've ever met in my life. Sharon is making plans to wed Ozzy. It will be his second attempt. I think actually he's marrying me so he doesn't have to give me 20% anymore. [chuckles] ♪♪ I was still that drunk. I mean, when we first got together, we both would meet drink for drink. And then one morning, she says, "You know what? I can't do this anymore." She never drank again. I said to Ozzy, "One of us has gotta be sober, 'cause we're never gonna survive this." I thought... I just go, "What's wrong with her?" It wasn't her. It's what was wrong with me. Ozzy's got a great heart, but unfortunately, his addiction is bigger than his heart. I don't know what I'd do without her, you know. Ozzy wanted babies. Five months after we were married, I was pregnant. We were over the moon when we found out. We were like, "Yeah!" So it was very exciting. Aimee was born, and it was like, "Here you go. Tour time again." Aimee, Ozzy, and I on the road, and we toured like that forever. ♪♪ The one tour that I will never forget was the Motley Crue tour. ♪♪ Ow! [crowd cheering] We used to have the wildest times, man. The "Bark at the Moon" tour with Motley was over the top. That tour with Motley Crue, we used to do the craziest [bleep]. Is it true that I snorted a line of ants? It's incredibly possible, but do I remember it? No. I remember one time in Memphis, Tennessee, we went to Benihana's. I had a sake. And I was drinking it out of a soup bowl. [horn honks] The next thing I know, I wake up in pitch blackness, and I'm like, where the [bleep] am I? These pair of lights come toward me, and I go, "What the [bleep] is that?" And it goes... [makes whooshing sound] ...right past me. I'm feeling like I wanna take a piss, and I'm feeling in the dark. I [bleep] had to piss. And suddenly it blew like a whoo! Cop goes, "When you finish shaking that thing, mister, your ass is in jail." So I was thrown in jail at 6:00 in the morning. That's how I got in the jail. I made it a rule, never go to a police station, never pick him up. "You're a big boy." ♪♪ I don't know how any of us survived, but then it started to twist on me, and I started to take the persona of Ozzy offstage, and I had to drink more and more and more to get what I wanted, and I didn't wanna be... really be... and it just twisted on you, you know? Is it always like this, or is this an exception? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Come on! Come on! [laughter] Yeah. I never drank socially. I never took coke socially. I never smoked dope socially. I never did anything socially. I did it to get [bleep] up, you know? [bleep] off with the camera. Sobriety [bleep] sucks. You think, "I know I can make him stop. "If I threaten to leave him, he'll stop. "If he knows what a [bleep] father he is, "he will definitely learn a lesson, and he'll stop." No. They'll stop when they want to stop, you know? You can't make anybody stop, and if anything, you know, his success and his... money just made it all worse. I wasn't drinking for pleasure. I was self-medicating. We call it "Dutch courage" in England. ♪♪ Ozzy was in a bad way physically, you know, drunk every day. I just couldn't take it, so he'd promised that he would wait until Kelly was born, and then he would go into treatment. Sharon came up to me. She said, "I found this place where teach you to drink like a gentleman, properly." I'm going, "That's it. Why didn't I think of that? I've been doing it all [bleep] wrong." I was there for Kelly's birth. I remember Kelly being born as if it was yesterday. I was born October 27, 1984. And on October 28, 1984, my dad flew to the Betty Ford Clinic for the first time. So when I get there, I go, "Where's the bar?" She goes, "What?" "Where's the bar for me to start drinking?" "You're in the right place, but we ain't got a bar." And then it was like six weeks without a drink. But as I was leaving there, this one woman said to me, "I've listened to all these other counselors "tell you how wonderful they think you are. I'm telling you, you're gonna [bleep] drink again." She said, "And every time you pick that glass up, you're gonna see my face." How long did Ozzy stay sober after Betty Ford? About... 45 minutes. And every [bleep] time I picked that drink up, it wasn't the same anymore, and I'd see that woman's face for the longest time. ♪♪ Hi. My name's Jack Osbourne. My name is Kelly Lee Osbourne.

I love them all in different ways, but, I mean, because they're all different personalities, you know. Being aware of his addiction problems was something that was... always been on the radar.

Like, one of my first memories is, it was my third birthday that my mom videotaped him doing what he thought he was being the fun dad. He locked us all in a Wendy house, which is like a kids' playhouse and went and got his mask... - [children screaming] - The prosthetic mask from the "Bark at the Moon" music video, which is terrifying.

We had a nanny living at the house then. And I was just sat down, reading, and he... he's, um, he came into the room. I had no idea who was sat across from me on the sofa, but it wasn't my husband.

For some reason, any time something crazy happened, it was always followed by, like, a trip to Hawaii or, um, a vacation somewhere, and I think to be honest with you, things like that is why I hate going on holiday. I don't like going to places where there's a beach and there is sun, because it reminds me of being a kid, and that was what we did after Dad did something bad. Yes, they love each other. They're business partners. They have kids. They've both kind of created this, you know, brand and empire together. It's... maybe worth the fight every now and then. I was really... lonely without Ozzy. I really, really missed him. I missed his stupid, bloody jokes and even his untidiness. I really, really missed him. I hated being without him.

My heart was breaking every night onstage. I put on a brave face, but when you've got a broken heart 'cause someone that you love has got sick, you can't pretend not to have a broken heart. [amplified voice] She's doing [bleep] great, man. I owe my life to Sharon. The thought of losing her was just absolutely unbearable. When the chemo was over, Sharon's cancer was gone. ♪♪ Can you visualize yourself doing this at 50 years old, - playing rock 'n' roll? - No. I mean, I suppose I'll still be involved in some form of music one way or other, but I don't think I'll be doing it at this pace another 15 years. [beep] Retiring? [bleep] off. ♪♪ [amplified voice] Are you ready? I just turned 70. Ozzy, happy [bleep] birthday, mate! Yeah! - I'm sober today. - Love you. And, you know, and yesterday I was sober. The day before that, I was sober. And I don't plan on getting drunk today, but I don't know. ♪♪ I can honestly tell you I never thought he would get sober. I just didn't realize how much more I was capable of loving him when he was sober. He is a different person, completely. One's too many, and 10's not enough, and that's so [bleep] true. When you wake up, and you don't like the way you feel every morning, you go, something's gotta go one way or the other. I just didn't like me anymore. ♪♪ He is known as the Prince of Darkness, but this morning, for the first time, legendary rocker Ozzy Osbourne, alongside his wife and manager Sharon, is shedding light on a private health battle and the moment he says everything changed last February. ♪♪ I had a bad fall. I had to have surgery on my neck, which screwed all my nerves in, and I found out that I have, uh... It's, um Parkin 2, which is a form of Parkinson's. ♪♪ The initial shock is, "I've got Parkinson's!" But nobody knows what the [bleep] it is. I didn't know anything about it apart from the name. He's been diagnosed with full-onset Parkinson's. Why should it be a dirty little secret? So if anybody out there gets diagnosed, don't be afraid to ask questions. It was at a place where... you can't run from it, you can't hide from it. Something's wrong. I'm no good with secrets. I cannot walk around with it anymore. Because it's like I'm running out of excuses, you know. He may not be able to run up and down like he used to onstage, but it's still about the voice, and he's still a funny [bleep]. Nothing can take that away. Nothing. Number one question from me was, is it a terminal illness? And the guy says, "No, but life is." It's just another thing on my plate that I gotta deal with. I'm not in the slightest worried about it. Just no hiding it now. He's in a position to help a lot of people. He can become a really amazing source of inspiration for a lot of people living with this disease. ♪♪ You know what? Life goes on. But right now, right here today, I'm [bleep] great. ♪♪ 'cause I ain't done yet, you know? I got a lot left. And we're doing that album, which is the best medication I've had all along. Doing the record with Andrew Watt saved my life. He's always had a funny walk, so [bleep] it. You know? This ain't nothing different. No pity. He doesn't need pity. He just needs a stage. You know, Ozzy's always been a man of the people, which for me is... is just one of the things I love about him. My audience is better than any drugs, alcohol, sex, woman, relationship, apart from my immediate family, I mean. I mean, it's the best love affair of my life, my audience. I think he feels an obligation to himself and I think he feels an obligation to his fans, and that's, I think, the sign of good music, is because it hasn't skipped a generation. His music has touched every generation, you know, that's been exposed to it since it came out. [cheering] I think that the audience has a sense of that could be me. I think he's a regular bloke. He does these wild things that seem dangerous and may actually be dangerous, and we... we receive that information as freedom. And the idea of being free like Ozzy is very exciting. I don't think Ozzy is similar to anybody. To me, Ozzy's just original. So you get stripes for that in my book. He's like the godfather of... of metal. The guy's no joke. He... He... He lives it. He did party and all that other stuff, but I respect him as an artist, and he really gives his all for his performances and to give the fans something they want. I'm 23, and I feel like sometimes I can't do a [bleep] tour, but Ozzy's still crushing 'em and kicking ass to this day. I think it's pretty bad-ass. It's incredible. You can't be defined as this one thing when you're someone like Ozzy. He's one of the only people that, maybe other than Bowie, that I can think of that smiles onstage. He always has a huge smile on his face like he's gonna burst out laughing, or he is laughing, and that is so infectious, especially in a genre where everybody's trying to out-grimace everybody else, out-tough everybody else, and Ozzy is just at the center of it, like, with this giant grin on his face the whole time. Like, "When do you think he's gonna retire?" I'm like, "Look at him up there. Look at the smile on his face. He ain't going nowhere." ♪♪ Talking to him, I'm like, "Do you feel like you've done it?" And he's like, "No." And that kills me. He's never sat back and gone, "I'm good. I did it." There's guilt and shame associated with his journey. I think you never feel like you've made it. That's the paranoia that you always have. As soon as you kick back and you think you've made it, it's over. You always feel like you're one second away from being done. ♪♪ Both Black Sabbath and his solo material were the, uh, the playbook for heavy metal. I don't know what music would be like if it weren't for the influence of Ozzy. It's everywhere. ♪♪ [laughter] ♪♪ [singing "Paranoid" in Spanish] [laughter] Ozzy changed everything. ♪ All day long I think of things ♪ ♪ But nothing seems to satisfy ♪ ♪ Think I'll lose my mind ♪ His voice is his legacy. It's so instantly... identifiable. You hear one note, you know that's Ozzy. ♪ Occupy my brain ♪ Everything you wanna say is right there in the music. ♪♪ He constantly works at trying to be a better person, trying with his sobriety, becoming a better father, being a good granddad. and just constantly, constantly trying to be better. I love that about him. I think people love my father for the same reasons I love my father. He is the most irresistible madman you will ever meet in your life. Pearl's class is singing "Crazy Train" at their school play. Um... ♪♪ [voice breaking] I don't know. It's just... It's kinda cool. [chuckles] You know, yeah, he's done a lot of, like, [bleep] weird things and he's been [bleep] at times, but, like, his contributions have been far greater than any of his faults. ♪♪ Like, that's how he should be remembered. And then I'll [bleep] do an encore. I'm the Prince of Darkness. ♪♪ This right here was the very first tattoo when I was about 14. My father kicked my [bleep] ass when I got home with it. And I bought some Indian ink. I did that myself. That was done in prison by a guy who was doing life for [bleep] killing somebody. The thing about tattoos is a tattoo is not just for now. It's for the rest of your [bleep] life. But you know what? Another thing. Tattoos [bleep] hurt. ♪♪
