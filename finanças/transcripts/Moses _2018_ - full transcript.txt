Mama, this is the place. Yes. What do we do if the Egyptian soldiers see us? I don't know. I'm trusting that God sees us. Miriam, hurry! Get down! Quiet, my son. I think I hear a baby cry! Stop! You see anything? No, nothing. Keep moving. Why are they taking all the Hebrew baby boys? I don't want to give my brother to them. We're not giving him to the soldiers, we're giving him to God. Mama, look how good it floats! This will keep him safe. I'm going to miss that little voice. My son, I love you so much, but I must let you go now. I must. Mama? Mama, are you going to let go? Into Your hands I send him In faith I release him He is Yours Please, God, show him the way Into Your hands, we send him In faith, we release him Please keep and protect him Oh, God Kiss the morning sunshine Kiss the morning dew Kiss the morning colors of gold and blue Kiss the morning sunshine Kiss the morning dew Kiss the morning colors of gold and blue Kiss the morning sun Kiss the morning sunshine Kiss the morning Kiss the morning Kiss the morning Kiss the morning sun Ohmma! Ohmma! Yes, my child, what is it? It sounds like a baby, in that basket, floating on the water! What? Safiya, bring the basket to me. It's a Hebrew baby. A beautiful little boy. -I will bring him to the soldiers. -No! Princess, all infant sons of the Hebrews must be drowned in this river. Well, today, the waters of the Nile have brought life, not death. He's hungry. My Queen? If it pleases you, I could find a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for you. Why you rude little slave girl, get away from us! Actually, I think that's a wonderful idea. Run and get one now. Yes, My Queen! Have you lost your mind? No, I've found happiness. Finally, a son of my own. But, Ohmma, don't I make you happy? Yes, Neferure, daughters can make their mothers happy, but sons can make them powerful, and this one has been blessed by the gods. How could you ever trust a Hebrew? This one, I believe I can trust. When the child is weaned, bring him back to me. Nurse him for me, and I will pay you. You are to call him Moses, because I have pulled him out of the river. You may go. Miriam! What is she doing? I'll take this. What? That's ours! My daughter, they can have the ugly basket. The boy belongs to me. Papa! Papa! Aaron, Aaron, they're back! Papa, God heard our prayers! He really heard our prayers! Yes, praise God! God, by Your hand He's come back to me He's in my arms again By His hand, He's there to guide you In His hands, we rest our faith And I know He's right there beside you To help each day To find your way For you belong to God Now, God has sent you back to me My joy, my hope And someday I know I must let you go again Now, in your tears, I see your kindness In your hands, I feel your strength And in your eyes, the wisdom to bind us To lead the way to a brighter day For you belong to God Finally, he's mine. Let him go! Moses, do you remember Mama telling you about the nice house you're going to live in someday, and the nice people who will take care of you? Do you remember? -Yes. -Yes? Well, it's now time for you to go. I know you're frightened. Mama is, too, but you are going to become someone very important someday, Moses, someone great. Promise me, you will always remember the Greater One. Come, my son, come to your mother. But you're not my mother. -He stutters! -What have you done to him? He's never done that before. I'll fix it. Come, my son. God is watching over you, Moses. He will always be watching over you! I love you, Moses! Safiya, take him and clean him up. Scrub every bit of Hebrew filth off him. He's Egyptian royalty now, the gift from the gods! He belongs to me! Now, just a child A mound of clay My future, I can see unfold I'll mold him well And time will tell If we will ever see the throne For now, I see my destiny And he belongs to me He'll be a man who cries out for justice Be the man to lead us all By the hand of God there to guide him To light the way to a brand new day For he belongs to God -You'll be a man -You'll be a man -Who cries out for justice -Strong and bold -Be the man to lead us all -The future, I now see my son -By the hand of God there to guide you -I'll be there right by your side -To light the way to a brand new day -Mother of the mighty one -For now I see -Now, let yourself be -Our destiny -What you're destined to be -He... -He... -Belongs to God -Belongs to me And, music! Movement! And... Open the doors! Louder now. More feeling! Good! It's good! And now, Queen Hatshepsut, her daughter Neferure, along with Thutmoses III! Excellent! And now, Moses, Pharaoh's Vizier! Where is Moses? Where is Moses? Find Moses now! And now, our ruler and our god, Pharaoh Thutmoses II! Magnificent! Perfect! Except the person all this is for is nowhere to be seen. Semnet, where's Moses? Isn't he supposed to be in his chariot? -One would have hoped. -Well, where is he? -Here he is! -Here he is! Moses, right this way. Quickly, come! I need to speak with Pharaoh. -Now? -Yes. Moses? What is it? Pharaoh, the people have been waiting for hours. We must proceed with the ceremony. Moses and I will come later. All right. We will wait. Here. While the rest of the parade marches through all of Egypt! Pharaoh, I want to thank you for the opportunity to be your Vizier. Well, all right, but you've earned it, Moses. In all my kingdom, there's not a man mightier in words and deeds. My gods have honored you, and you will honor them. That is why I must refuse your offer. What? I can no longer worship your gods, and I will not lead others to worship them. Is this supposed to be humorous? No, Pharaoh. You know I have worshiped the God of my mother since I was a little boy. I don't care what you worship as long as you also worship the gods of Egypt. I can only serve one God, the God of the Hebrews. The God of slaves? He did not make them slaves, you and your fathers did! My husband, the magnitude of this day is very emotional for Moses. You need not worry, he will not fail you. I am not doubting his ability, only his loyalty. Moses, I came today intending to give you this royal scepter. Even now, that is still my desire. Take it. Lift it up. Feel its weight, its power. With this scepter, whatever you command will be done. I have great plans for you, Moses, but you must be loyal to me, to my gods, and to Egypt. No, I can't. -No! No! -Stop this! If you choose to worship the God of slaves, you will live as a slave. I would rather suffer with the people of God, than enjoy the rotting riches of this world. -Stop! -He has made his choice. -No, he hasn't. -He has rejected me for cockroaches! No! That is where you are wrong! -What is this? -Moses, watch your temper! You and your gods hate the weak, and the poor. But the God of my ancestors strengthens the weak, and cares for the poor! Fine! As Vizier, you'll have power to help them have a better life. They don't need a better life. They need to be set free! Set free? -I've heard enough! -Wait, wait! Now, Moses, stop this daydreaming and face reality. They are not your people! They don't want you! -Your own mother didn't want you! -That is not true! She got rid of you, and I kept you. You belong with me. Enough now, Hatshepsut. Let him go. No! I will not let him go! Hatshepsut! You are being foolishly idealistic. Your faith in the Hebrew God is that of a five-year-old. You can't possibly reject all this because of some childhood bedtime story. -Enough now. -No! You can't allow this! The gods gave him to us to make me great! Hatshepsut, as Pharaoh, I command you, silence! Moses, by leaving now, you surrender all your rights, privileges, and protection as a member of my family. I understand. I don't ever want to see you again, cockroach. Hatshepsut, come now. My people are waiting. Moses, the cape. Semnet... I can't believe what I have done I've finally made my stand My day has come No going back, I've made my choice Now, I must find my way And find my voice I've played a part for all these years While my people suffered grief and tears I must shed this life, though I am shamed I must let this spark become a flame I feel this fire A yearning to be free A burning desire To find my destiny I'm feeling something there Something strong Something yet to be Something greater than me I see my gray skies turn to blue As I turn the page and start anew I must hold on to this and make it last I must find my future, lose my past I feel this fire A yearning to be free A burning desire to find my destiny I'm feeling something there Something strong Something yet to be Something greater If I'm not the man I was Then who am I now? It's a new life that I must live God, show me how I feel this fire A yearning in my heart A burning desire To make a brand new start I'm feeling something there Something strong Something yet to be Something greater Than me Heavy these bricks, heavy these packs Clay and straw, breaking our backs Call out to God with each breath God won't hear, life is death Every year is just the same Every day we toil and sweat in pain Every second an eternity In Pharaoh's game Mothers, fathers, children, all Do what you're told when Pharaoh calls Feel the whip Bend your knee Rest when you die Then you're free Get back to work! What, what? Jacob, Jacob, just pick up the bricks and put 'em over there. You know, we've been doing the same thing for 350 years, it's no different today. Excuse me? Excuse me, can I speak with you for a moment? Idle lips bring the promise of the whip. Your voice. Could you look at me again, please? If you haven't noticed, we're all slaves here. The guards don't approve of us entertaining strangers. I see. I see. But they approve of this? This prophecy there over the door from the great Joseph? "The Lord will surely visit you and bring you out of this land. "When you have been delivered, take my bones with you." The guards can't read Hebrew. How can you? I studied it in Pharaoh's library. Pharaoh's library? All right, who are you? I'm a man searching the brickyards of Goshen for my family. I was told a man named Aaron worked here. Well, there are many people in the world named Aaron. Could one work here? It's possible. All right, if your name was Aaron, and your parents were Amram and Jochebed, and you had a sister named Miriam, and a brother who looked a lot like me... -Moses? -Aaron. -Moses? -Aaron! -Moses! -Aaron! My brother! I can't believe this! Why are you here? I'll explain everything. But first, I have to know is mother... No. No, she's been gone a long time now, but our sister Miriam... -Miriam. -Moses. It's me. -My baby brother Moses! -Miriam! I cannot believe you are actually here, in my arms. -I have missed you so much. -Let me look at you. -God did hear my prayers. -Yes. I knew he would, Aaron. Miriam, all these years I've wanted to thank you for protecting me, but I stayed away. It's all right. You were chosen to... No. It is not all right. My entire life, I lived in a palace with everything at my fingertips, while you, Aaron, and mother suffered here in this place. I could've done something, Miriam. I should've. Baby brother, you're here now and that's all that matters. It's God's plan. Here, you've come a long way, come and sit down and have something to eat and to drink. Here, sit right here, Moses. I hope you like leeks and onions. Enjoy! Come on. I had no idea how bad this really was for you. They always kept it a secret from me. How long have you lived like this? Well, we don't live long. A life of bondage devours a man's potential, defiling his dignity, corrupting dreams into nightmares. Aaron! Aaron, you speak better than some members of Pharaoh's court. You should not have said that, Moses. You really think so? Now, he'll never stop talking. You know, I've always known. I've got this amazing ability to communicate thoughts and ideas so that people can understand, be inspired and learn from what I have to say. Humility is not one of his many gifts. You know, I often wondered, "If only I had the opportunity "to grow up in Pharaoh's household, "as you have, Moses, what could I have done?" Aaron... Yet you were chosen to grow up in golden splendor, and I slaved my life away in bitter obscurity. Why? Aaron! Why does God choose one man to be a king and another a slave? Why? -Aaron! Stop talking! -What? Yes! Fine. We don't even know why Moses is here. I have turned my back on all of the riches of Egypt. I've renounced it all, to serve the Lord, and to live with you, the people of God. That is the most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life. Well, to me, it's the most courageous. You gave away all of your authority and influence, for this? Now, he's just like every other Hebrew "deliverer" that rises up against Pharaoh. Big dreams, no power, dead. Stone by stone Toil and fear Brick by brick, year to year Where is He now This God of our fathers? Long ago, so we sing He was there in everything Where is He now The God of our fathers? Where is His promise in the stars? They've gone away, no lights remain We dream in darkness and live in pain We're all alone He's silent as stone Still, we look to the God who was Nothing left, broken dreams Empty hearts, silent screams Where is He now The God of our fathers? Where is His promise in the stars? They've gone away, no lights remain We dream in darkness and live in pain We're all alone He's silent as stone He's silent As stone No, it is not hopeless. The Lord will deliver you. -He will deliver you through me. -What? Through you? Yes! From the moment I read this prophecy of the great Joseph, I knew! I knew why our mother put me in that basket. -And why Pharaoh's daughter found me. -Why? The Lord has prepared me for this. He has raised me up to deliver all of you from bondage! I knew it! I knew it all along. I've been saying it since he was a little boy. -Our brother was born for greatness. -Aaron! Born to save His people and set the captives free. Born to humble the proud and exalt the humble. -Aaron, please... -Born to lead us to the Promised Land -flowing with milk and honey. -Aaron! -What? -Stop talking. Yes! Fine. Listen, I know you're all afraid, and you don't know who I am, but you can trust me. You can trust! I have led armies to victory on the battlefield, I have overseen the building of monuments, I speak many languages. I can help you. We need to go! What's happening, what is that sound? It's the guards telling us the work day is done. Go, it's Hunchback and his two sidekicks. We cannot delay... -Miriam. -We must go now. All right, you lazy jackals, back to your huts! We'll see if you made your quota today. He's in my seat. Why is he in my seat? Get up, old man, you know the routine. I don't feel well. I don't care, get out of my seat. I can't. I can't. Am I gonna have to help you again? Stop! Stop beating him! Let go of me! Why is no one helping him? Get out! -Don't let them see you. -I don't care! Stay here. Well, drag him out of here. You'd think these animals would just learn to do what you tell them. A whole lot less painful. I will follow you in a moment. This is no time to act out of anger. You need to... You need to walk away, all right? -Just, just cool down. -Yes, come, Moses. You don't have to protect me anymore, Miriam. That's your sister. Well, what have we here? Are you hungry? Are you hungry? So am I. I've got just the place for you. In you go. A little hot at first. Yeah. What's that? Who are you? I am Moses. Moses? The Moses? We heard you got yourself kicked out of Pharaoh's court. What an idiot! Why are you here? To stop you. Listen to this. It's true! The mighty Moses can't even speak! You will not treat people this way. What people? They're animals. They’re stupid, lazy, dirty sheep. Did you see that? That Moses killed Hunchback! Good for us, bad for him. Well, I'm getting the rest of that stew! Not 'til I get mine first! Hey! Get back here! Keep your hands off of it! It's mine! You always take it all! No, you don't! Come here! No you don't! No you don't! No. A rat! That's mine! -No, you don't! That's mine! -Hey! -Give it back! -Don't eat it! Hey, kids, stop it! What are you doing? Go get the elders. You shouldn't treat each other this way, you're children of Abraham. We're slaves who don't get enough to eat. -Hey! -Hey! Why are you striking him? This is not how you should treat your brother! Who made you judge over us? And who are you to talk? Are you going to kill me as you did Hunchback? -What? -There! That's him! He killed Hunchback! -What are you talking about? -I saw it! Your great, all-wise brother just murdered Hunchback. No, no you're a liar. I mean, that can't be true. Moses... It is. I'm sorry. -Why would you... -I was only trying to help! Help? Why would you do something like this? You have ruined everything! When the rest of the guards find out, they're going to make us all pay for your crime. -Right! -Yes, it's true. They need to know that he did it, and not us. Moses must pay for this! Grab him! Take him to the guards! Get him! There he is! There he is! Run, Moses! Run! Moses, here, put this on! Move it! Move it! He went that way! Move! Moses. You're right, I have ruined everything. No, no, no. I should not have said that. Here, take this. There's some bread in here for you. -Miriam, please forgive me. -We must find Moses! I love you, Moses! He's got to be somewhere close. Here, quick. Get inside. Help! Help! An Egyptian with a Hebrew tunic! He stole my money and ran off that way! Help! They're gone. You're safe. The gods brought you to me once in a basket, and now they bring you to me again. What? Hatshepsut? How did you know? I've followed your every move. I could not lose you. You’re too late. I am already lost. No, you're not. I'll fix everything, and you'll be back in Pharaoh's favor again. -Look, it isn't right. -Who cares? Whoever's on top of the pyramid decides what's right, and that's where you belong. I don't know where I belong. Here, with me! Now, you see what I told you was true. Your mother didn't want you, those Hebrews don't want you, but I always have. Ever since I was a baby, I have been drifting through life, alone. And you, you have held on to me, hoping I could help you become powerful, but I can't. I won't. It is time you let me go. No. I can't do that. Guards! You always have a plan, don't you? I have to. I've always had to. Take him to Pharaoh. No! Wait! You think I just wanted to use you to gain power for myself, and that is partly true, but I really just wanted someone I could love, who would love me, and you came closer to that than anyone. Release him. But, My Queen, he killed an Egyptian soldier! You heard me! There. I'm letting you go. Go! All alone Grief and tears Step by step Year to year Nothing left, broken dreams Empty hearts, silent screams Slow down. Don't waste water. This always takes forever. We're almost done. One bucket at a time, girls. Look, it's the Ethiopian traders! They're so handsome! They are wolves in sheep's clothing. But they travel to such exotic places. I want to go with them! Not a chance, little lamb. Zipporah! You filled the water troughs for us! Thank you! The Lord has provided water for you in that well. Come back this afternoon. We are merchants. We work with our minds, not our hands. I have strong hands! I'll help you water your animals! Me, too! Me, too! I will also! As one neighbor would help another. Our neighbors can help themselves to our water, one bucket at a time. Zipporah, you are just like the desert you live in, tough and dry! Come on! How are we ever going to get husbands if you chase them all away? Those are not husbands, they're jackals with jewelry. You deserve better, and you will wait until someone better comes along. -I love you. -Don't leave, I love you. Azmah, Tzibyah, bring father's sheep now. Yes, Zipporah. Those are not father's sheep! Excuse me, sir, but you're going to have to wait to water your animals. We've filled up the troughs for our flocks. Well, you can fill them up again when we're done. "One bucket at a time." You can't do this. It's not right. Whoever's strongest decides what is right, and that is me. So, now, we want you and your sisters to get us some water! Do we have to do that? Leave her alone. What? Who are you? Just let them water their flocks first. We take whatever we want. -Yeah... -Right! And right now, we want these women to get us some water! -No! No! -I have a better idea. How about you get me some water! What is this guy? This will not end well for you, my friend. Get him! Hey! Get him off the wagon! I got him! Hey! No, no, no! Come on! Hey! Papa! All right, pretty boy. -Look out! -Thanks. No problem. Behind you! No! No! Get out and stay out! Girls! Girls, control yourselves. And go tell father what happened. -But... -Go! That was amazing! Thank you! -Wait until father hears about this! -Thank you! You can water your flocks now. You're hurt. I am thirsty. My name is Zipporah, daughter of Jethro, priest of this territory. Your father is a priest? Well, his God didn't protect you today, did He? But He did. He sent us a deliverer, you. I am no deliverer. Look. There he is, father! That's him! He risked his life to save us! He was incredible! I see. Thank you for protecting my daughters and my flocks. Such bravery is rare, especially in a stranger. They needed help. So, I helped them, that is all. -You're Egyptian? -No. Then to what people do you belong? I don't. I see. -My daughters... -Yes? Go and prepare a meal and a place for this man to rest. He shall stay with us. I've never seen that look in your eyes. -What look? -Love! You get back to camp, and I don't want to hear another word of that. Thank you, but I need to be on my way. Where will you go? Good-bye. The nomads have a saying, "No matter where a camel goes, his fleas are sure to follow." What? I'm old. And when you're old, you lose things, your teeth, your eyesight, your hearing, your sense of smell, though that last one is a blessing when you spend all day with sheep. But you do gain an understanding of what is truly important in life. Yeah, and what is that? Stay, and you'll find out. Hey, you don't know who I am. No, you don't know who you are. You're a fighter, a warrior. But you're wounded, and like most wounded men, you will stay that way for the rest of your life. It doesn't matter. It does. It can keep you from becoming the man God created you to be. I don't know who I'm supposed to be. Well, I'm a priest, so I'm going to tell you the truth. I believe the Lord wants to set you free from your past, to show you who you are, in Him. No, I tried that, it didn't work. I understand, but now let Him work. In His way. In His time. Stay with us. Stay here? What would I do? Become a shepherd. I don't know anything about being a shepherd. Good! Then you're just the right man for the job. Egyptians hate shepherds. Well, it's a good thing you're not Egyptian. No, I appreciate your concern, but I need to keep going, all right? So, you are a man who would rather hold on to the past than grab hold to a new beginning? A new beginning? For what? God's best for you! Catch! It might seem like a simple thing To lead a shepherd's life You must be firm, you must be kind And patience you must find Nice to meet you. Goodbye. You must protect the little ones When you lead a shepherd's life With a gentle hand, they'll stay in line And follow rain or shine The morning sun, the waning moon Will guide you night and day And you will know the man you are When you learn the shepherd's way You might think it quite mundane To lead a shepherd's life But living simple, living well But what about that smell? So all good things do come with time When you lead a shepherd's life Time to think And time to dream And time to find a wife -A what? -A wife. That's right! The blazing sun, the twinkling stars Will guide you night and day And you will know the man you are When you learn the shepherd's way With just a glance and patient hand They'll sense your every whim Help me! Your flock will always look to you As you must look to Him So, look above and look to God He'll guide you night and day And you'll become the man you are When you know the shepherd's way Yes, you'll become the man you are When you know the shepherd's way Bound up in love Hum-a-lay, hum-a-lay Woven together Hum-bai-lay, hum-bai-lay, hum God's plan is complete, a mystery Who-ma-lay, who-ma-lay Who-ma-lay-who Over the years Hum-a-lay, hum-a-lay Growing together Hum-bai-lay, hum-bai-lay, hum Making a life, a family In good times or bad In joy and in strife It's the heartbeat of life That is found in the rhythm of love Over the years Hum-a-lay, hum-a-lay Life lived together Hum-bai-lay, hum-bai-lay, hum Laughter and tears, a history Who-ma-lay, who-ma-lay Who-ma-lay, who Children grow up Hum-a-lay, hum-a-lay Hearts will grow wiser Hum-bai-lay, hum-bai-lay, hum Family becomes our destiny Who-ma-lay, who-ma-lay Who-ma-lay, who In grief and in hope In darkness or light On our journey together, we dance On our journey together, we sing We sing On our journey together, we live To the rhythm of love And we do it again! Papa, papa, can I come with you? Me, too! I want to come along! Boys, boys, listen. The backside of the wilderness is no place for young explorers to roam. Someday, my son, but not today, all right? Be careful, the wilderness is a dangerous place for anyone, including you. I can take care of myself, Zipporah. Have you forgotten about the five nomads I beat the day we met? Only because I had your back. And I still do. Come home soon. I don't like it when you're away. I love you. -Jethro. -Yes. Jethro. Thank you. Thank you. For what? For being the son I never had. My sons there, they only know me as I am now. They have no idea I once held a golden scepter and all of Egypt would have followed my every command. Well, now, I lead a bunch of sheep with a stick. You still don't trust Him, do you? -Who? -The Lord. You're still running from Him. You know, Jethro, sometimes you say things... That need to be said. Moses, why do you think these sheep follow you? Because I lead them to food. True, but they would follow you to the endless sands of the desert if you led them. Why? All right, I know what you're trying to say, Jethro. I don't think you do. See, these sheep know your voice, they study your every move when you bring warning, correction, or affirmation. They know their very lives depend on you as their shepherd. They trust you, Moses, because they know who you are. Jethro, I have earnestly sought the Lord, studying His ways for 40 years. How can you say I don't know Him? Because you don't believe He loves you. You're right. I don't! Because He doesn't love me. How could He after all I've done? Everyone fails. No! No! No. Not like me. This is different. Thousands of Hebrew babies were drowned in the Nile, and I survived. I was trained in the finest schools in Egypt. I lived in Pharaoh's own house, all of it to prepare me to go and deliver my people from bondage. And what do I do? I get angry and murder a man, and ruin everything! I was supposed to be the answer to my people's prayers, but instead, I'm their condemnation. That is a lot to carry. And I am tired of carrying it. I am done. Good. Now, your journey can finally begin. Your flock is waiting, Moses. It is time for you to go. Safe journey, my son. The Lord be with you. Jethro! Lord above, we cry to Thee You're still our hope Hear our plea Come to us now Oh, God of our fathers What is that? Moses. Take off your sandals. You are standing on holy ground. I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Why are you afraid? Because you know who I am, and what I have done. Moses, I do know you, and now I want you to know Me. You do? I have always been with you. You are not alone. You belong to Me. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. As I have been with you, I have been with my people, enduring their suffering. Now, the time has come to deliver them out of bondage and into the land of promise. Yes, Lord! Yes. I have chosen you, Moses, to bring My people out of Egypt. What? But I can't, Lord. I don't speak well... Go to Pharaoh, and tell him to let My people go, so that they may worship Me here in the wilderness, on this mountain. But, Lord, who am I to lead Your people out of Egypt? You are not alone. I am with you. All right, suppose I do go to them and I say, "The God of your fathers has sent me to you," and they ask, "What is his Name?" What should I tell them? I am! I always have been, and always will be. I am all you need. Tell them I Am has sent you. Yes, Lord, but what if they don't believe me and they say, "The Lord did not appear to you." What is in your hand? A shepherd's staff. What is it? No! Now, reach out your hand and take it by the tail. This is so they will believe that the God of their fathers has appeared to you. Now, put your hand inside your cloak. Leprosy, Lord! Now, put your hand back inside your cloak. It is gone. I am God. Yes. I create life, and I save from death. Now, go. I can't, Lord, please, please. I’m sorry. Please, Lord, send someone else! I can't do this! What about your brother Aaron? He speaks well. Yes! Yes, Lord. He is already on his way to see you. You shall speak My words to him, and he will speak to the people for you. Now, take your shepherd's staff, and you will perform all My signs and wonders with it. All right. I will. I'm feeling something there Something strong Something yet to be Something greater Than me! Aaron. Miriam. Well, brother, here we are, the brick factory, just as you left it 40 years ago. All right, Aaron, you do the talking. You don't have to worry about that, brother. Speaking is my gift! Children of Israel! The time has come for us to be set free. The Lord has spoken! He sent us His Deliverer, my brother, Moses! Come on! Aaron, what happened to your gift? They're exhausted, they need a moment to take it in. Let's come back later. No, no, just let me talk to them. Don't worry, I prepared something on the way. Brothers and sisters, you must listen to me! Moses has met the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He saw the Angel of the Lord in a burning bush that never burned up! Our God spoke and said He has heard our cries, seen our suffering, and He has called Moses to come and lead us out of Egypt, into the Promised Land! Be quiet and get back to work, Aaron. Look, we've had to do your job while you were gone! A burning bush that never burns up! Why didn't you bring it back so I don't have to fan these flames anymore? I'm telling the truth, the Lord has spoken to Moses! Well, if God did speak to him, why isn't he the one doing the talking? "Speaking" is not his gift. Now, I, on the other hand... Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know who you are, Aaron, but we want to hear him speak. Yes! Well, what do you have to say "Deliverer?" Speak up! -What is it? -We're listening. I... You can’t talk. Way to go, Aaron! Wait! -No, no, no! It's all right. It's all right. -It's sorcery! Egyptian dark magic! Do not be afraid. Look and see the power of God. Leprosy! He's a leper! -It is magic! -Yes! No, no, this... This is not magic. This is the Hand of God, reaching out to us. Why? Because He knows you, and He wants you to know Him. Can I believe my eyes? This stirring in a soul gone still so long ago I'm taunted to deny it Did I just hear a song Sung deep within my heart? Sung by the God of Abraham and Isaac? For a hundred years times four We've implored You Might you end this cruel oppression, Lord? We've prayed As a people, broken, before You Could the God who was Still be our God Today? If there is hope, it's in Your name The only God with power to save To guide our path, to light our way A God who is The One who's worthy of all praise To whom our broken hearts we raise You are the One we've seen today Our God who is Today! Every tribe and every nation Of His mercy and goodness will proclaim We will sing of Your greatness forever The God of yesterday is still with us today! Eternal hope is in Your name The only God with power to save You'll guide our path, You'll light our way Our God who is! The One who's worthy of all praise To whom our grateful hearts we raise You are the One we've seen today Our God who is Our God who is Our God who is today Today! And therefore, is here seeking repayment for all the damage done to his cow, which this man claims never happened, and in fact, has testified that the cow in question broke through his fence... Father, how much longer must you judge? I want to shoot arrows with you! You do, huh? Councilor, how many more cases are there? Well, endless, but five more until we recess. Magicians, butcher the cow, serve it tonight for dinner. You win. He loses. All right, son, let's go. But, Pharaoh... I love my son more than anything, and when I enter into eternal life, he will rule over your sons. So, I suggest you honor him now. I do and will continue to. But, Pharaoh, there are two men here who have been waiting for days to see you. They claim to have a message from their God. Amenemhat, would you like to hear a message from a god? Is he powerful? I don't know, let's find out. Where are they? Here they are. Them? Well, all right, who is your God? The Lord God of the Heb... Hebrews. The Lord... God of the Hebrews? The God of slaves! Father, what do you think His message is? I don't know, maybe something like, "Those slaves are tired of making bricks, "could they weave baskets instead?" I needed that. Councilor, tell these men I won't even discipline them for coming before me with such foolishness. All right, son, let's go shoot some arrows. The Lord has spoken, let My people go. That's why I'm the mouthpiece. I can't stand any more of this. Thank you for the entertainment. Now, leave. Aaron. Please, Pharaoh, let me explain. The God of Israel has said, "Let my people go, "so they may hold a festival to Me in the wilderness." The God of the... Who is this God that I should listen to Him? I don't know Him, and no, you will not go. Please, Pharaoh, let us take a three day's journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, or... He will strike us with plagues or the sword. What? That is not what the Lord said! Do you want to do this? What are your names? He is Moses, and I am Aaron. Moses. Moses. Why is that name so familiar? Your stepmother Hatshepsut raised me. Yes. Hatshepsut. She loved you! I hated her! So, now, you have come back to take my slaves away from their labor? Councilor, give these orders to every slave master and overseer in the land. They are no longer to supply the Hebrews with straw for making bricks. They will gather their own straw. But require them to make the same number of bricks as before. -No! -Don't reduce the quota! They are lazy, and that is why they are crying out, "Let us go and sacrifice to our God." Make the work harder so that they keep working and learn not to listen to lies! -Pharaoh, that's... -Okay, that's enough! Let's go. So, the God of slaves has come around. That's fine, but he says for me to hand over to him what's mine. Just understand that I'm the god here, I call the shots. I say what's best. And when I tell the Hebrews to cut their own straw, they'll do it with not one brick less! How dare you waste my time? How dare you stand there making your demands? You must think me a fool Remember I'm the master of this land They'll stay in chains where they belong Perhaps you've talked with sheep too long So, to this point, I must impress I'll not spare the rod and lash And you will give me all I ask Not one brick less! Heavy these bricks, heavy these packs Clay and straw, breaking our backs Call out to God with each breath God won't hear, life is death Moses, you have made us a stench in Egypt and put a sword in Pharaoh's hand to kill us! Mothers, fathers, children, all Do what you're told when Pharaoh calls Feel the whip, bend your knee Rest when you die, then you're free You liar! Deceiver! Go back to where you came from, Moses! You're no deliverer! So your God sends a mumbling shepherd with a staff Into my land Let My people go or else... He says to me! Well, here I am! Hebrew God, it's either you or me A fight unto the death! But in the end You all will pray to me So do your worst! Bend your knee! The god of Egypt demands Not one brick less Foolish, ignorant, useless shepherd's staff! The first two she made sunk. What? Everyone thought she was crazy, but she kept weaving these reeds over and over until her fingers bled, coating it in tar and covering it in pitch until finally this one, it floated all day and it was completely dry inside. This... This is the basket that mother put me in at the river? You kept it all these years. It reminds me of her, and how God uses foolish and broken things to accomplish His work. How broken do I have to be? Enough to let go. But I have let go of everything, Miriam! I left my wife, my sons, the peace and safety of my family to come here, and look, look what I've done. But why did you come here, Moses? Because God told me. Then who changed, Him or you? The Lord doesn't speak to me anymore. I pray to Him, but He doesn't answer. I just feel so alone, Miriam. I need to go back home! And run away again! Moses, when mother put you in this basket, she didn't swim down the river and take you back when the water got rough. God. Where are you, God? Why are You so silent? Moses... Yes, Lord. Finally. Here I am. I will stretch out My hand and perform mighty miracles. I will take My people as My own, and I will be their God. Go to him again. Tell him to let My people go. Yes, Lord, I will. If You will go with me, Lord, I will do it. I will make you seem like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. When I lay my hand on Egypt, all will know that I am the Lord. Yes, Lord! Yes, Lord. You... You were a great start, but now it is time to finish! Aaron! Aaron! Aaron, wake up! Wake up, Aaron! We have to go back to Pharaoh. Yeah? Because that turned out well. No. God is going to take care of all of that. Now, I need you to talk for me. Moses... Moses, you've only been here a short time. I've spent my entire life with these people. I can't... They can't take any more broken promises, and I won't do that to them. Aaron! Aaron! Do you believe that the Lord said He would set our people free? I did. Well, then, who changed, Him or you? Okay, now that was good! Look, you don't need me to talk for you. Yes, I do. Miriam said that. I'm... All right, okay, just don't hurt yourself. We're better together, Aaron. We are, aren't we? -We go talk to Pharaoh again, huh? -Yes. Again and again, and again and again and again, as long as it takes! All right, brother. You pray, I'll talk, and God will deliver! Let's go, brother! Was it the leeks and onions? You know, suddenly, Pharaoh doesn't seem so bad. Let's go. Amenemhat, have you speared any fish yet? I'm not looking for fish, Father, I'm hunting crocodiles! Is he safe? I don't want him to get hurt. He's fine, he's just like me! Fearless! Look, if it isn't the stuttering shepherd and his exalted mouthpiece! If you're looking for straw, there might be some over there! This is what the Lord says. "By this, you will know that I am the Lord. "I will turn the water of the Nile and all the waters of Egypt into blood. "All its fish will die, and you will not be able to drink its water." Amenemhat, get out of the water, now! My son! Father, what's happening? The water in the pots has also turned to blood! Get me off the water, now! Magicians! Make this stop! Almighty Pharaoh, we, too, can turn water into blood. We just don't yet know how to make it stop. -You better figure it out, you fools! -Yes, yes! Come on, Aaron. Let's go. Moses, Moses, did you, I mean, I can't... The whole river turned to blood, Moses! Well, that's what the Lord said He would do, Aaron. I know, but... He really came through! And did you see Pharaoh's face? He's not laughing now! Now, he'll let our people go! No. I don't think so. Not yet. He's embarrassed, but not broken. Moses, tell Aaron to stretch out his hand, and from the waters, frogs will come up into every village, house, and bedroom. At first, you relent You say we can go Well, I've changed my mind And I want you to know I will never let you go! I will never let them go... Stretch out your staff, strike the ground, and from the dust, gnats will cover the land. He promised to set us Pharaoh, enough is enough -Promised to set us free -He has hardened his heart I will never give up From the eastern skies, like black clouds, swarms of flies will descend upon Egypt. Pray for me, Moses, that this plague might end! He promised again to set us free His words are lies His deeds an act His stubborn pride is still intact I will never let you go! Now, Egypt's livestock shall die, but the Israelites' livestock shall live. By this, all will know that I am the Lord. Hear, our Lord, hear, our Lord No! No! Praise to the Lord Our God When will you bend your knee? Hear, our God And when will this end already? Pharaoh, set us free! I will never set you free! Take handfuls of ashes and toss them into the air, and I will bring boils upon the people and animals of Egypt. No! No! What is this? What is this? Pharaoh, now will you listen? Pharaoh, listen, their God is strong You will stay where you belong Stretch out your hand toward the sky, and hail will fall, destroying people, animals, and all the crops of Egypt. But my people will not be harmed. Pharaoh, you must set them free Pharaoh, you must set them free Pharaoh, you must set them free Pharaoh, you must set them free -No, I won't give in -He's the Lord of us all No, no! I will now send locusts to cover the ground, infest the houses of Egypt, and devour everything left from the hail. Set them free! Pharaoh has rejected the light. Now, darkness shall descend upon the land. Go, worship the Lord. Take your women and your children and go! But you will leave your flocks and herds behind. How can your heart still be so hard? Didn't you say your God was the One who hardened my heart? No, it is what is inside a man that determines how he responds to God's light. I have no idea what you mean. In the sunlight, wax is softened, but clay, it is hardened. The same sun shines on both. Yet it softens one, and hardens the other. It is the same with the hearts of men. Your livestock stay in Egypt! We cannot worship the Lord without bringing a sacrifice. No. No! Nine plagues have been poured out upon you! Each one an opportunity for you to lay down your pride and surrender to Him, and stop His judgment. It is not too late. Let my people go, and save the lives of your people! I am finished with you, Moses! I know who you are, and how my stepmother gave you every golden opportunity and privilege, and you threw it away! A failure. Your own mother got rid of you. You're unwanted. And you belong to no one! And your God is nothing more than a God of slaves. This is what the Lord says, "Israel is my son, my firstborn. "I told you, 'Free My son, so that he may serve Me' "But you have refused to free him. "Now, every Egyptian firstborn son will die. "There will be wailing in Egypt such as never before, "yet among the Israelites, it will be so peaceful, "not even a dog will bark! "Then you will know that God knows who belongs to Him and those who won't." Get out of my sight! Don't come to me again! The day you see my face, you will die. Just as you say, I will not come to you again. Moses. You didn't stutter once. Tonight, at midnight, I will pour out the tenth and final plague. Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad Hear, oh, Israel The Lord our God The Lord is one Each man is to take a lamb for his family. It must be pure, spotless, without defect. Then, as darkness falls, each lamb is to be sacrificed. Baruch shem kavod Malchuto L'olam va-ed Praise be to God Forever and ever Forevermore Once the lamb has been sacrificed, take a branch of hyssop, dip it into the lamb's blood, and apply the blood upon the doors of your households, the entrance into your homes, for the angel of death is coming. But when he sees the blood, he will pass over, for the blood of the lamb will save you. -Sh'ma Yisrael -Hear, oh Israel -Adonai Eloheinu -The Lord our God -Adonai Echad -The Lord is one Eat the Passover meal with your cloaks and sandals on, and your walking sticks in your hands, for I Am bringing you out. Hear, oh, Israel -The Lord our God -Praise be to God The Lord our God -The Lord is one -And all of my strength -Bless His name forever -The Lord is one So love the Lord your God With all your heart And all your soul And all your strength Hear, oh, Israel Hear, oh, Israel Remember this day for all generations to come. For this is the day that I will cause death to pass over you, and give you life. Moses. Moses, where are you? No, no! My baby! My baby! Moses! My baby! My baby! My son. My son is dead. What have I done? Quickly now, go, worship the Lord as you have requested, you and all of the Israelites. Take your flocks, herds, everything, and go! But first, Moses, bless me, that the Lord would spare my life! May the Lord bless you, as you prove yourself loyal to Him. Moses, we are not Hebrew, but we believe in the God of Abraham. Would you take us with you to worship Him? Yes, of course! You are all welcome. Come. Thank you, Moses! Children of Israel, assemble yourselves by families! It's time. It's time to leave these brickyards behind. Last night, we went to bed as slaves, but this morning, we woke up free! Yes! We are going to a land flowing with milk and honey! Aaron! So that all nations on Earth will be blessed through us! -Aaron! -What? Keep talking! Moses, let our people go! Do we have the bones of Joseph? Yes, yes! These two young men have volunteered to carry them. Joshua, Caleb. Good. The Lord bless you both for serving. The word of the Lord through Joseph has come to pass! The Lord has kept the promise He made to Abraham so many years ago. We are going to be the people He created us to be. We are going to live in the Promised Land. Is there any God like our God? Praise be to God forevermore! Eternal hope is in His name! -Our God has set us free! -Praise be to God! The God who is He set us free! Our God has set Us free! We're free! Hallelujah! So, in the end, it is the cockroaches who survive. Now, who's going to make our bricks? I will add the God of the Hebrews to the sacred gods we worship. How can we worship a God who has taken our next generations of leaders and warriors from us? My husband, will you not avenge the death of Egypt's sons? Of our son! Will my beautiful Amenemhat die in vain? It will take us years to recover from this. Wait until Nubia, Ethiopia, and the Hittites hear about it. We'll lose all the new territory we've gained. We'll just have to wait and see. Wait? For what? Until all the nations mock me, and every slave in the land decides he, too, will be free? I have the most powerful army on earth. Will we now allow slaves to taunt and ridicule us as cowards? No! Those ignorant, brazen Hebrews need to be whipped and chained -and marched right back into Egypt! -Yes! Prepare for battle. I want soldiers, horses, chariots ready for war! Now! Moses. Moses, why have you led us away from the wilderness, here to the sea? The Lord has led us here, not me. But why? He wants the Egyptians to know that He is Lord. He sent them 10 plagues. I think they know! Yes, they know. Pharaoh's heart is still hard. He's coming after us! There he is, there's the traitor! What are you talking about? Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us out here to die? Didn't we say to you in Egypt, "Leave us alone. -"Let us serve the Egyptians?" -No! Hundreds of chariots and thousands of soldiers are coming! We must escape. We are surrounded by water on three sides! Well, there is no escape! Moses has led us to our death! Why did you deliver us? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die here in the wilderness! Send us back to Egypt! It's not too late! Send us back! We want to go back! Quiet! Listen. Now, you listen to me! Moses did not lead you to this place. God did. God has led you to this place, not Moses! I knew it would turn out this way! -He told us to believe, to trust the Lord. -Well, yes! I'd been disappointed so many times before, I couldn't. But then, the plagues came, one after another, and it seemed maybe this really was God working on our behalf, so, I let myself believe! And look where it's gotten us! Trapped between the sea and a sea of soldiers. They're getting closer! There's twice as many soldiers as there were before! Twice? There's twice as many. You must keep your faith! The Lord will make a way for us! Aaron! Aaron, take this. Hold them back. Oh, my Lord! I know You did not send an entire nation of people out here to perish! Please, Lord, remember Your promise! Deliver us! Moses, why are you crying out to me? Stand up. Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea so my people can go through on dry ground. Help us, God! Please! -Please, help us! We cannot do this. -You must believe! Yes, Lord. -We cannot. -Believe with your heart. I don't know... -Aaron. -What? I'll take that now. -Aaron, what is he doing? -What is happening? What is happening? Go! I am the Lord. You must have no other gods before me. Do not make anything into an idol. Do not speak my name in vain. Set apart the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Honor your father and mother. Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. You shall not steal, lie, and bear false witness against your neighbor. And do not lust after your neighbor's wife, house, or belongings. Father, You have delivered your people and You have delivered me, but these laws, they are so holy. We will never be able to keep them. We are destined to fail. I know. That is why what I have written on stone, one day, My Son will write on men's hearts. I sent you, Moses, to deliver my people from the bondage in Egypt, but I will send my Son, Jesus the Christ, to deliver the world from the bondage of sin. Like the Passover lamb, He will sacrifice His life, so others can live. If there is hope, it's in Your name The only God with power to save You'll guide our path, You'll light our way Our God who is The One who's worthy of all praise To whom our grateful hearts we raise You are the One we've seen today Our God who is Today! Eternal hope is in Your name The only God with power to save You'll guide our path, You'll light our way Our God who is! I will sing to the Lord... -The one who's worthy of all praise -I feel this fire -I will sing to the Lord -To whom our grateful hearts we raise You are the one we've seen today For He is highly exalted and good -I'm feeling something there -Something greater The One who's worthy of all praise To whom our grateful hearts we raise You are the One we've seen today Our God who is Our God who is Our God who is today Today Today! Our God who is Our God who is Our God who is today Today Today!
