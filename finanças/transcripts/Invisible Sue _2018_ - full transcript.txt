I've always loved comics. My dad has a huge collection. Even rarities like "Super Moon", the girl with the moon scream. Her real name is Theodora Summers but everyone just calls her T. She got bullied for her very bright eyes and her strange hair, but when she discovered her real powers and became Super Moon, everything changed. Since then she knows who she is and what she has to do. Unfortunately, real life is much more complicated. I wish I had some special skill so at least somebody would be interested in me, but I'm not like Super Moon or like T. Sue, where are you? Um , I'll be there in a sec. We don't have much time. You got the package? Yeah. Hurry up. Hello? Miss Gunnarsson? Susanna, oh my God. I didn't see you there. I thought everyone had left. No problem, I gotta go. Bye. My dad says this is your special skill. No one notices you, like a secret agent. But is it really cool if no one even knows you exist? No, he won't say no. It's gonna be - an epic Halloween party. - Excuse me? Excuse me? Eileen, please can I just... ♪ But how how how's it goin' ♪ Hi Gwyn. Yes, DJ Goblin is playing. Amazing, huh? Yeah, I know. Ugh. Worst of all is my mother. She's one of the world's leading scientists. She's incredibly successful, especially at ignoring her own daughter. Nobody really knows what she's doing in her laboratory. Okay, here we go. This is going to change the world. I know my mother's inventing crazy things all day and working with the greatest scientists. She thinks I'm boring, but she shouldn't underestimate me, because today I'll show her what I'm able to do. Good evening and welcome. May I introduce the man who this very day has announced a revolution in the field of genetics, Doctor Jonas Drill. Ah, yes. Thank you very much. Imagine if you will, living in a world without illness, a world without weaknesses, with your body reacting by using, let's call it a protective screen. Engine started, target localized. Ready? Yeah. Do you want me to drive old man? Let's get out of here, come on. Please, welcome with me one of the most successful geneticists and mutation scientists and my good friend, Dr. Maria Hartmann. Maria uh, in a nutshell, your creation uh, could be called uh, the human 2.0, yes? She's not even here. Sue, don't worry. Let's stick to the plan. She'll be here. Good evening. Let's begin with some dry facts. Uh, honey I don't think that's a good idea. Ah, damn! Oh. - It's all right. - Dad! I got it, I got it, I got it. NT26D is the working title for this program. Christopher? Oh. Okay, go. Ready? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Christopher, you can't be serious. I'll tell Dr. Drill. Oh no. Do you realize what you've done? What the hell were you thinking? Well, it was meant to be a surprise. Do you have any idea what you've wiped off here? Yeah, I do but do you realize it's your birthday? I wasn't talking to you Susanna. Christopher, we are making history here. We thought you'd like the surprise, but of course not. It's always about your work. You have to go now. Please. Lenia's waiting. - I have to go back. - Come on Maria. She wanted to surprise you. - Today, of all days - It was my... You pulled this. Christopher! It was my idea. I lit the candles, okay? Sorry kiddo. Hundreds of the best scientists are there. This could win me the Nobel Prize and you bring me cake. Why don't you go to hell then? Activation process initiated. Emergency shut down activated. Damn it. Damn it. Bio reactor temperature at critical level. Stop, come on. Stop. - I - don't like to intervene but you shouldn't press anymore buttons. What? Uh, who's speaking? Warning, reactor overheating. No! This is not very productive. The reactor can only be shut down manually. Frickin' great. If I may say so, this is not the answer. Please, shut up! Are you some kind of computer or something? Hello? Talk to me. You ordered me to be quiet. Man, can you help? Do something. The core temperature is already too high. It's critical. I advise you to leave the reactor immediately. I strongly urge you to exit the building. Get out of here now. Hello! Gauze please? Your daughter was very lucky. She had more than one guardian angle today. All done. I'm glad nothing happened to you, and you can't remember a thing? Uh uh. Um, I was just sitting there, and suddenly there was this like loud bang. And you didn't notice anything unusual before? Um, we better go home now. Uh, we'll talk about the rest tomorrow. Yes, I agree. Hope you feel better and I thought your little birthday surprise was really cool. Thank you. Let's go. We thought you'd like the surprise. You know she isn't even supposed to be here. This is no place for a child. We've talked about this before. Come on Maria, she wanted to surprise you. She didn't even ask me how I was doing. Yeah, she did. No she didn't. Liar. She was there first after the explosion. To rescue her brilliant project. She doesn't care. I'm invisible to her. Super Moon? Morning. Uh, you okay? Mm, yeah. Um, I'm good. We're practicing. Practicing? The moon scream. Uh huh. Oh, also we only have... I know, only 10 minutes. Exactly. You can't abandon me now. Not after yesterday. Abandon you? It's just a short tour. Just a few days. You're a traitor. Cry baby. I really love you. I love you too. Is that a new backpack? Why? It's a weird color for you. Have fun in Prague. Have fun in school. I always do. Liar. Mm hm. Oh, yuck. I've seen some fake blood but I don't know which hair color yet so I'll let you know what I decide. A Halloween party? Awesome. Oh uh, hi. You're Super Moon? Uh, yeah. I'm T. Uh, uh, I mean... T? Tobi, Tobias Grimm. Hi, I'm... Excuse me, hold this for me. Hi. You must be the new guy, right? I'm Eileen. Have you heard about the Halloween party? DJ Goblin will be there. - Damn. - Selfie, cheese. - Super cool Eileen. - What? What's happening? Where'd she go with my hot chocolate? What is happening to me? Why am I invisible? Hey Super Moon, - where did you go? - Am I dying? Oh, I must be dreaming. Oh, it feels weird. Oh my God. Completely invisible. Damn, stop it! Go away. Dang it! No, no, no. Oh my God! What's happening? You have to believe me, I'm telling you the truth. The bathroom is haunted. There was something there. - Everything was moving. - Now Jean, calm down. Let's just take a look together, okay? Oh, Susanna, good morning. I swear, there was nobody. I mean, somebody but something invisible. Susanna, did you see anything unusual? Mm mm. But, someone was here. I saw them. Not like seeing but... You just come with me for now, all right? And I'll see you in a little bit. Uh, yeah. Hopefully, you'll see me. We have a new video conference in two days. But Dr. Drill, everything is completely destroyed. It'll take weeks to rebuild. The day after tomorrow, five p.m. Mom! Mom! Susanna? Susanna! Susanna? I, I can make myself invisible. Good morning. How are you? Are you hungry? You want something to eat? I feel like I've run a 10,000 mile marathon. Here. This will give you energy. Carbohydrates and enzymes. What an unbelievable effect. We need to do a lot of tests. I ordered an infra red camera so I can film you even when you're invisible. Then, we'll have real proof. I took a sample of your blood and I'm getting it tested but you... Susanna? What? Are you invisible again? Are you able to control the effect? Does it react to external influences? Does it come suddenly or... How did you do that? Warm and cold, I guess. Amazing. At what temperature? Let's try it again. I'm not your science experiment. What if it stays like this forever? I can't even wash my hands without my body disappearing, do you understand? I'm a monster, a freak ever since I touched that blue stuff. Can you please just make it stop somehow? For now, you'll stay at home, okay? No school today, not a word to anyone. No texts, no email, do you understand? You've reached the voicemail of Christopher Hartmann. I'll call back as soon as possible unless the world is ending. Damn it. Tobi, that was awesome. So, about the Halloween party, - I was thinking you maybe... - Could you hold this? Hi. Hi. You disappeared yesterday. Yeah, happens a lot lately. Okay. Uh, that's yours right? I have the second issue at home. The second one, yeah? Yeah. So you know the school freak now? Anyway, party's at the old town pool. Sue? Forget her. She's a bit nuts, kind of a loser. Get me? No friends, reading super hero crap all day. You already got a costume? I can help you. Leave him alone you piece of trash. Hey! It's you, I forgot you were still lurking around. - What is that? - Oh my. Wait, that's not mind. That's not my ringtone. I can't turn it off. It's coming from, it's coming from, I don't know why it's doing that. Okay, we have to get out of here. Thanks. You're from the robotics club in the basement, right? It doesn't mean we're friends now. You get me? My name's Kaya but everyone calls me App. Okay, App. Oh uh, hi. Hi. Uh, um, I wanted to ask um, would, would you like to um, I was wondering... Would I like to? Maybe we could, I don't know, maybe we could, I don't know, do something, go somewhere uh, together? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Okay, good. Right uh, cool now I have to go to class. Uh, me too. Uh, okay all right. Yeah, maybe later? Later? This afternoon? Oh, uh yeah. - Yeah, yes. - Okay good. See ya. Bye. Sue! Some of the NT26D touched your skin during the explosion. It's a genetically modified substance that I've developed and it's intended to cure our bodies of diseases or injuries. The NT26D must've entered your skin. Here... It really worked. The wound is gone. The NT26D took care of it. I, I'm gonna take a few measurements now to get a better idea of what's happening exactly. Here. Snap it and it'll turn extremely hot and then... Unbelievable. Hurry up please, this doesn't feel great. Uh, Sue? May I? Sure, yeah. Is this your hand? Yeah. Oh my God! Everything I touch becomes invisible. Seems like it's transmitted by skin contact. How strange. I feel so powerful like a super hero. The NT26D molecules are mutating. They merge with red blood cells and activate as soon as the body temperature... It's pretty fast. Yes, faster then I thought. The warmer it gets the longer she'll stay invisible. And what does that mean? We have to destroy it, immediately. You wanna do what? Lenia, just think about it. Yeah, maybe the NT26D can heal, but what if those who take it become invisible or have even worse side effects like mutation? Then we have to start again from scratch. It's my decision. Please Maria. Let's recheck the data and run some more tests. Mom, what are you doing? You, you can't do that. If you delete everything you can't make the antidote. Susanna, I can explain it to you but not now. We'll talk later, okay? You need the data to reverse it, Mom. You're never there for me. Susanna! No, my name is Sue. Bad spot to take a nap. Hey, girl. Wake up. Come on, I'm not waking you up with a kiss. What? Am I, can you see me? Um, yes. Oh, just great. Hey. Sue, what's up? You said it's urgent. Sorry, must have something to do with uh, that thing. That thing? ♪ And then I mess with you ♪ Please don't laugh at me. You heard of mutation research? Because, I can make myself invisible. Oh my God, you really are nuts. No, please I need your help. And what do we have here huh? Freak one and freak two. Oh hey, I'd say hello with some yodeling but uh, - I'm not as into it as you are. - What? Are you crazy? It was you outside, right? You hacked into my phone. You are so dead - you crazy psycho! - Let me go now! Or what? Hey, you piece of trash? Over here! Over here. Awesome. What? Just imagining Eileen wit fries and ketchup. You can laugh, but I'm at the top of her hit list now, Mom. I'm not just a freak but I'm dead meat, too. I'm a terrible person for laughing, aren't I? Yeah. This project means everything to me, and I don't have a clue why there was an explosion. It never should've happened. I'm afraid we have to go into hiding for now. If somebody finds out what the NT26D can do, what you can do, we won't be safe any longer. Dr. Drill? Dr. Drill? The videos you asked for are here. Oh, thanks. Tell me, has anyone else seen this? No, just me. Hm? Should I carry you into the house? Come on, honey. Come on now. Come on. Help! Somebody help! Susanna! Susanna! Mom? - Susanna, find Alfred! - Mom! And the red mask. Alfred! She's gone! Mom! Mom! What? Sue, calm down. No, slowly, what happened? Dad, Mom's been kidnapped. We're in trouble. You have to believe me. I can make myself invisible because of that NT from the lab. Invisible? Uh, okay. Maybe Mom can give me some too. Then I'll be invisible. Sound check's about to start. I'll call back. You have to believe me. Come on, please. Come on. Come on! Hi, are you okay? I need your help Tobi. What's wrong? It's all my fault. My mother's been kidnapped. I just thought she was crazy. She told me not to go out and tell anybody. Here, it's all I could find. Thank you. My mother's on night shift and my father's only here on weekends. That's why we moved, to change that. So you can sleep here tonight. I'm here by myself most of the time anyway. But we better call the police. No. No police. But why? Sue? Not again. The tea. Are you? Can you give me the blanket? Tobi? Tobi? I'm sorry. You were invisible. I know. Awesome! Eileen is right. I'm a freak. A freak? Why did this happen to me? You can make yourself invisible. How cool is that? You're a real super hero. Think about Super Moon. First, she hid in the basement, right? She believe people thought she was a monster. Or they chase her for her powers until... Her parents were robbed and her little brother was kidnapped. Exactly. And then she went out and blew them all away. She destroyed everyone with her gigantic moon scream, her Super Moon moon scream. Thank you, Tobias Grimm. Uh, um, you can have the mattress. I can make something to eat for you. Sue? Then I'll take the mattress. Super heroes always have a sidekick but I'm not sure how I can help you. The only thing I'm good at is cycling. First, we have to find out who kidnapped my mother. The black van was over there. Mom kept shouting that I need to go find some guy named Alfred, and a red mask. I don't know any Alfred or about a red mask so. I still think we should go to the police. And say what? My mom made a liquid that makes me invisible and that's why she was kidnapped? You're right, it sounds totally reasonable. Have you ever broken into a car? Me? What makes you think that? Tell me that that was you. Uh uh. Sue? My mom's laptop. Maybe there's something about Alfred on it. Hello? You're getting visitors. Make yourself invisible and hide that clown. What are you saying, who is this? FEMALE ROBOTIC VOICE: Trust me. I have information about your mother. I don't have anymore pocket warmers, without them... Get in. Get in, fast. Really? 'Cause a voice tells you to? Do you have a better idea? Run away! You've got 10 seconds left. I'll wake up any second and this was all just a nightmare. Seven. Three. You, check the house but be careful. Don't frighten the girl and take the car back to the company. Understood, Sir. Great, what now? Shh. Excuse me, could you help me? I'm contacting crazy. Oh. I'm not interrupting anything am I? Where are we? The DEC, the Drill Energy Corporation. Wasn't easy to get in here. Were you following us all the way here? Yep. Don't worry, he's just having a nap like the guy at the gate. I put the video surveillance on loop. We better hurry. It won't be long 'til they figure it out. Come on. Follow me. Is she on the team now? What are you talking about? Tobi, this is App. App, Tobi. App, like on a phone? Yeah, got a problem with it? No. Here, have a look. That's the car your mother was kidnapped in. I wanted to show you yesterday. I even rang your doorbell but you didn't answer. The van is registered to the Drill Corporation. I think Drill wants to force her to produce the NT26D. And how does she know all that? Because she has a brain. I'm going in there right now. Sue! What's your plan? To get my mother out. Do I have to go in there too? Yeah. Here, you'll need some pocket warmers. You're such a genius. I know. Here. That's how we'll stay in contact. And with that I can see exactly where you go. All right guys, let's do this. Come on. Sue, wait. My arm. Awesome. Invisible man. Awesome. Hold my hand tight and don't let go. Aye, Sir. But did you follow my recipe? I don't know why it didn't turn out right. What did you do? I ate... - Tobi! - Sue! Hi. Oh my God, are you okay? Uh... How did you get in here? I don't know. I was in school a second ago, and then there was this uh, this pain and a red light. And then it just, a portal yeah, opened. It was gigantic. Come on! Oh! I told you not to let go! You just ran into her. Mom! Mom! Mom! It's all empty. There's nobody here. I'm getting a third signal. Could be from another cellphone. Maybe Sue's mom's? Are you okay? No, I feel like, it seems like two people makes me twice as tired. Don't fall asleep okay? You hear me? Did you really think she'd be here? Sue? Hey, I found something. Sue? Sue? Just great. Bertie, search the building. The children are in there. Hey guys, they found us. You should leave as fast as you can. Sue you gotta wake up. I don't wanna rush you but they're heading right for you. Man! Hey! What are you doing? I wanted to wake you up. You know I'm not Sleeping Beauty, - right? - Yeah. Where did you get that? I found it and a phone too. You have 10 seconds. Get out! Did you see the kids? Where? - That way. - It was only one child. - There? - Over here. - Fell down here - I don't know. and then he disappeared. Come. Tobi, why do you only stutter sometimes? Do we have to talk about it now? Yeah. It happens when I get nervous. Like now? Would you please hurry? Don't panic, I'll get us out of here. The kids must still be in here. Seal the whole building. The children are gone. We need an infra red camera. Damn! How are we gonna get out of here? Stay behind me. Okay, come on. Now. How long can you stay invisible? Probably 'til I fall asleep. And it happens every time? Yep. ♪ La la la ♪ ♪ La la la la ♪ ♪ La la la ♪ ♪ La la la la ♪ Soda, for what? Better then kissing me awake, right? I'm your sidekick. Just be professional. Uh huh. We almost made it. Come on. Around the corner. Look out! Two guards. I see them. Behind the cabinet. Duck down. Okay, head for the door. Go! Go! Faster, we have to get out. Watch out Tobi, the door! Oh! Whoa. They're out the door. Move, move, move! They're out the door. Aw, stupid automatic door. There they are. Seize them. They're heading east towards the refinery. Any suggestions? Just have a sleep and I'll make us invisible again. Hop on. On that thing? Come on Tobi! Aren't you the show off on a bicycle? Yeah, on a bicycle. Then pretend it's a bicycle! Go! Stop! You're trespassing on private property! - Whoa! - Seize them! What is that thing? A flux capacitor. A what? Whoa! No! Hey! Tobi, your life or all. That was so awesome. I was invisible. You really have to try it App. No, that's your specialty. We should hide at my place tonight. Drill won't look for us here. Wow. Now I know how you could afford all those gadgets of yours. It's my aunts house. We're just allowed to live here. Hey guys, thanks for helping me. I'd be lost without you. My aunt is in a wheelchair, so don't be surprised. Oh, and she's a bit, weird. Kaya, darling, I see you brought some friends over? Yes Aunt Laur. Could they stay here for the night? Of course they can. I'll call your mother. She can bring home something to eat. Cool. Thank you. Uh, we'll be upstairs. Susanne? Oh, pardon me. Sue, would you have a moment for me darling, please? Uh, yeah. I'll see you in the library. Uh, are you okay? Anything I can bring you? That's very kind of you Sue, but I'm fine for now. Some days my body just won't do what I need it to do. Um, how do you know my name? Mom, Lenia and is that you? Hm. Your mother was the best one in all those years at the university. Ambitious, determined and incredibly naive. But in the end we had a fight and fell out. She was obsessed with the idea of creating the perfect healthy body, and she wanted to sell the NT26D to the DEC and I did warn her but she didn't wanna listen to me. Do pass on my warmest regards to her. Yeah, all right. I'll do that, when I see her. That Drill guy from the factory, I think, is he dangerous? People are often not what they seem. You can't be too careful. Sue? What did my aunt want with you? Uh, she knows my mom from university. Long story. So, did you find anything? I got into your mom's cellphone. Oh, look. There's a video on it. I've been kidnapped. Whoever finds this, protect my daughter. Play it again. Where is that? Violence is never the answer. What was that? It came from your mom's bag. The red mask. Please say what kind of scientific, Miss Susanne, welcome back. Please don't throw any cake. You're the voice I heard in the laboratory. That is correct. What are you? What I am exceeds your wildest imagination. Just call me Alfred. Alfred? You're the Alfred? That is correct. Where is Dr. Hartmann? Who kidnapped her? It has spoken to me. Does he mean me? My I point out only Hartmann family members can access my database. Where's my mother? Unfortunately, I do not have sufficient data for a complete analysis. Hello! Out, fast! I beg your pardon, I am not a dog. - Turn off, please. - Kaya! As you wish Miss Susanna. Hi. Hi. I'm Lisa, Kaya's mother. I'm really sorry. If I had known I'd have cooked something proper. A spaghetti, lasagna, but there's just pizza now. This is great Mom. Pizza's great. Thank you. Well, I'm not here. I'm invisible practically speaking. Mom, please. Oh. Okay. Woo! Have fun. I don't have friends over often. In fact, you're the first ones. And the robotics club? That's just me and sometimes also me. I'm a loner. I'm just not good with others. Salami? App, we broke into the DEC today and got out without getting caught. We could've never have done that without you there. Mm, Sue's right. Uh, I'll have the cheese pizza and I'm not sharing. It is always a pleasure. Welcome back Miss Susanna. Sue, my name is Sue. Oh, pardon me. Miss Sue. What did Dr. Hartmann use you for? Oh, this is ridiculous. It's only a machine. I'm able to access 10 to the power of 367 processed in a millisecond, while you can't even master simple algebra, Sir. How does it know that? Stop it. Better answer his question. After Dr. Hartmann deleted all the data in the DEC she used my superior neutron processor to carry out further tests in secret. But why? To find an antidote Miss Sue. If you would please take a look. Okay Alfred, start recording. I will now inject the NT26D. Alfred, no reaction. The mutation is negative. Either I've made a mistake or, it's a genetic problem. What does she mean? I don't get it. Only you an become invisible Miss Sue. The NT26 only reacts with your blood. It has no effect on anyone else. So what you're saying is Drill had my mother kidnapped for nothing? Dr. Drill kidnapped your mother? Sue, they're not after you mother. They don't care about her. They really want you. That is correct. If hypothetically speaking someone plans to produce an invisibility serum on the basis of NT26D, then they will need Miss Sue's blood. In other words, you are in great danger Miss Sue. I've been kidnapped. Whoever finds this, protect my daughter. Huh? Sue, that was so cool. They thought I was you. I grabbed the first weapon I found and then smack! I can't stop thinking about that syringe. That was no coincidence. They were looking for you. Lucky thing I slept in Tobi's bed. Ugh. Hey man, not what you think. I was tired and I just fell asleep. In Tobi's room. Yeah, and he went over to mine. Ha! Stop it. I've got something for you. Fire proof material, extremely light and indestructible. With a hood of course. This remote sends hot and cold signals so you can control your invisibility. This is fully packed with my special mixture. To keep you awake you know? App, you are such a genius. Thanks. You could give me that cool hoodie of yours. Thank you. Delicious. Thank you Martha. Mm, where's Sue? Ha ha ha, so you're invisible? Time you thought of something new. That's not funny. They were my favorite. Did you order pancakes? So cool. Invisible Sue. Invisible Sue. I commend you on a great suit, Miss Sue. Susanna? Momma? Susanna, finally. Oh, thank God it's you. Okay, I don't have much time. I managed to escape but they're after me. You're in great danger. Mom, where are you? We meet at the old market in one hour. One hour, okay? At the fountain. Don't trust anyone. We... Momma? Hello? Damn it. This is not a good plan. We should've told App's aunt about it. She has no clue anyhow. She sleeps or reads all day. Guys, can we please concentrate. Why would your mother wanna meet us here? Don't you get it? Drill won't kidnap Sue with so many people looking on, yeah? I wouldn't be so sure. Yeah? Hey Invisible Sue, hope to see you soon. Aw, just a joke. I can't reach your mother, wanted to hear if you were all right? Uh, folks? We got company. Uh, I'm on my way home. I'll be there around eight. Dad, this is really bad timing. Sue? - I'll call you back. - Sue? That is definitely not your mother. Will you shut up? Sue, what should we do? Sue? Oh my God. Sorry. Miss Sue, may I draw your attention to the fact that your blood pressure is remarkably high. Alfred, get off the line right now. As you wish. Shit! Two men this way. Two men stay at the car. There they are! What are you waiting for? It's just a toy drone. Great move. Now they'll trust us. Why are you here? Jonas, damn it. She's my daughter. You should've let me know earlier. Miss Sue, I retraced your mother's most recent call and sent her last known position to App's pocket computer. Maybe she's still there and that's why she didn't make it here. Jeez, it's in the middle of nowhere. It's most likely another trap. Already forgot what just happened? Your mother lured us into a trap. My mother? Are you nuts? Hey Tobi, what's up? Coming to the Halloween party? I think you should. It'd be really great. Bye! No can do. He's got better things to do. Are you crazy? So they can't track our position. It was brand new. Don't cry. It was a crappy phone anyway. - Hey, what about this van? - Oh great. I'll meet you - under the bridge. - Now what? We gotta find these kids. Come on. I have an idea. Come on, let's go. Are you serious? You got a better idea? Hurry, hurry. Hey, that's mine! In which direction did they go? What? Which direction? They're right behind us. Watch out Tobi. Make sure do they do not get injured. Whoa. What are you doing? Old super hero trick. Ever watch E.T.? What? E.T.? Give me the flux thing, and Sue make us invisible. Why aren't they slowing down? Maybe they think they can drive right through us. Hold on tight. Woo hoo! Woo hoo! That was totally awesome! Tobi! Thanks. Alfred, is this the right place? Correct. This is the last known location of your mother. Sue, I don't like this at all. Alfred, can you locate my mother? That exceeds my abilities. Wow, what a miracle. Something it can't do. I will ignore this outrageousness and shut down for now. Sue, if your mother really escaped, where is she now? Why doesn't she call? Because I dumped our cellphones dummy. This is a trap just like at the plaza. First they lure us here and then wham and your mother? What? Is involved somehow just like this holographic machine. Are you crazy? You think my mother and Drill planned this? She would never do this. I haven no idea but we really need to leave. If you're so scared why don't you go back to your mommy? You're not even helping. So why don't you go back to that stupid Halloween party with your cute little Eileen? Sue. What? You want me to apologize now? And they say I'm the one who can't get along with other people? That thing doesn't look very friendly. Make us invisible, quickly Sue! Stand now. I can't. I guess it got damaged when we were on the bike. Computer's located. Remain where you are. Intruders located - in the warehouse sector. - Run! Stay where you are. Stay on the ground. Show your hands. Intruders located in the warehouse sector. Oh my God. Sue? Sue? Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. Oh! Maria? Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house? Did we lose them? Stand down. Stay where you are. Do not move. Come out with your hands up. Miss Sue, I realize your plan and strongly advise against it. This will distract them and run. We'll meet on the other side of the hall. NT26D is highly explosive Miss Sue. Alfred, not now. - On three. - Sue, wait. One. Why do I even talk? Two, three. Here, have fun with this! Momma? It's an original edition. Very rare. How did I get here? What happened? You passed out in school but the doctor couldn't find anything. He gave you an injection to stop the pain. Yes, the heating was off but it won't take long now. But you were kidnapped. Drill, I don't understand. Sounds like a really exciting dream. It was no dream. Mom, I can make myself... We need to go to App right now. Why? Where is Kaya? Wait, how do you know her? Come on Susanna, I know your friends. She ran into the hall after the explosion, when the flood lights were... You know how absurd this sounds, right? I'm sure she's fine. We'll call her first thing in the morning, all right? Oh, before I forget a boy called for you earlier. Tobi? Yes, Tobi. Because of the Halloween party? Halloween party? In the town pool. He wanted to meet Eileen there. Eileen? I'm sure he'll call again. Love you darling. Mom? Mom, what's up with the door? What's going on? Mom? Mom! Momma! Momma. Keep a close eye on her. She has to be kept cooled and no outside contact, - understood? - Understand. Copy that. Let's go. Right through. Yeah, go 'head. It's me. All done. I've got the girl. Kaya's at the old steel mill and the boy's at a party at a town pool. I'll take care of him, you go get the girl. Okay, I'll take my men to the party at the pool and we'll meet there and we'll get the boy first. I sure hope you took the girl's blood. Boss is gonna want it. Miss Sue, please do not cry. Let me show you something. Run she said, to the other side of the hall she said. Great. This place is gigantic. Shit. Sue? Where is Sue? Mrs. Hartmann? What are you doing here? And who are you? Hello? Susanna? App, get away from my mother. What are you talking about? Open it. Come on. Dr. Hartmann, what indescribable joy to see you again. Momma! Now can you tell me what's going on here? Only the real Maria can open the pendent. The real Maria? Look, let me show you something. I've always dream of being a super hero Susanna. A few days ago in the lab when you showed me that world, that feeling of power , my dream returned. Thank you. If I'd known that all I need is your blood. NT26D is harmless for most people and mixed with my blood it mutates and becomes a super serum. Mutating differently with each person as I suspected. Exactly. Each body reacts differently to my blood. I become invisible. Lenia can change her shape and Kaya could maybe even fly. Fly? Where did Lenia go? She asked me about Tobi and I told her about the party. Oh no! She's getting rid of all the witnesses. First Sue, then Tobi and me. Hi Tobi, I thought you were too busy. I thought you had other plans? Plans change. Wish me luck. ♪ Come along ♪ ♪ We don't care who you are ♪ Are you gonna freak out with your face?

She was so busy searching for Sue and completely forgot about me, and I was able to escape. I ran for my life with the others after me. I tried to hide in that hall when the ceiling suddenly collapsed. Didn't think your old mom could do that, huh? Not in my dreams. I must've fainted. I can't remember a thing until Jonas found me buried in the debris. Jonas? Jonas Drill? Yes. He's been helping me. So why didn't he just say so? We thought that he was chasing us all along. Jonas is the most loyal person I know. Here. I repaired the remote. And look under the seat. I've got something for you too. It's the antidote. A promise is a promise. An antidote? What for? Are you kidding? To stop you from turning invisible again. But I don't need it. I don't need an antidote Mom.

We need to leave. Eileen is not Eileen. She's Lenia. She took my blood. Please trust me. Why should I believe a word you say? Tobi please! I'm sorry for what I said to you. I was angry and I didn't know who to trust anymore. It was a huge mistake. I need you. We can't do it without you. Oh, look at you two. How sweet, but this time there - will be no happily ever after. - Hey, no! Let go of him you evil hag. Or what? You'll become invisible? Oh, I'm so afraid Hartmann! Do you see what I can do? I'm way more powerful than you. Susanna? Sue, Lenia's men just broke through the doors. They're everywhere. Keep right! It's now or never. Hey Lenia? You think you have power? You need more than that to be a super hero. Tobi, now! Sue, now! Game over. Sue! Clear, the left. And that was the show Invisible Sue and her mysterious sidekick Tobi. Hello? Help! Hello! Help! Anyone there? Eileen? Miss Gunnarsson, I'm in the bathroom. It's me, Eileen. Kaya, darling? Your mother asked me to come pick you up. Who's that? Um, that's our uh, music teacher. Drank too much. Okay then, maybe we should take her to the hospital. Check out the wheel of her wheelchair. Look familiar? Like on the video from the lab. Are you okay? Do you need help? Um, we forgot something back at the swimming pool? Was she drinking too? Uh, no, no. Allergic reaction. Miss Sue, I just placed an emergency call. You should run. The water's destroyed my system. Sue! Mom? Sue. Mom. Sue, no, no. Come on, come on. Mom! I'm tired of playing games. You must be wondering what's going on. Yes, I ordered Lenia to keep an eye on your mother in order to get her hands on NT26D. I also had your mother kidnapped when it was clear that the serum had this wonderful side effect. Sue! There. Now that we've explained all that, I'd be very happy if you'd all just get into the car. Understood? Now. Uh, but why? Darling, you think Drill can do all that but not me, a cripple? Profit and healing. That's a great combination. Get the children. Secure them. Block all the exits, and get this thing out of here. I just said! No! Let me go! - Sue! - Okay, enough now. Sue! Get in. We're going nowhere. The NT26D has been destroyed. My dear child, you're smart enough to know not all NT26D was destroyed. Exactly. It's running through your veins. My backup insurance plan, your blood. You let my parents and my friends go right now or you'll regret it. You're braver and smarter then I thought. But you should think about your next steps very carefully. If you inject that antidote, you won't be Invisible Sue any longer. No Sue, don't do it! All of your super hero powers will vanish. And you will just be this little unremarkable Susanna. That was a big mistake child. Yeah, it was. Old bag. Hey, hey! Hey! Guard, I'm going backwards! Sue! Invisible Sue okay? Kaya! I called the police! Sue, sue? Sue. Are you okay? Sue? Oh Kaya. Sue, sue? Sue? Sue? What's wrong? Sue? Sue? We need an ambulance fast! Dad? Good morning. Hm. Uh, drink this. What happened? You fell down the stairs at school. It was some scene, everyone running around crazy. We brought you over to your friend Kaya's house. You're lying. Just stretchin' the truth. Don't let him mess with you. Your dad's making up stories again. Dad, come on that's not funny. As soon as you're strong enough, we want all the details. Every single one. Really? Everything? Yes, all of it. The police? They probably want the whole truth as well. Hello, this is Christopher. Mom? Hm? Lenia was right. I've lost everything. If you will permit me, you have not lost anything. Alfred? Miss Sue, we are incredibly proud of you. App fixed it for you. It's yours now. Mom? You can open your present now. Oh. Thank you, Sue. Alfred is right. I haven't lost anything. Maybe I'm not Invisible Sue anymore, but I am Sue Hartmann. I have the coolest parents, an ingenious holograph Alfred, and App and Tobi too of course. The best friends in the world. So, I just got an incredibly long message from Eileen in my voicemail. You too? My voicemail is full of hysterical stories about her doppelganger. I actually feel sorry for her. Because of all of her lying and bullying, everyone thinks she invented all those stories just to get attention. Nobody believes her. This time for once, she's telling the truth. Ugh! Disgusting! With all due respect Miss Sue, your mother's antidote does not seem to be as effective as she would like it to be. Give me your hands. Everyone beware! Here come the fantastic three!
