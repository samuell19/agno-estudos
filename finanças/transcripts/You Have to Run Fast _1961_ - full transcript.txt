You shouldn't have beaten him up so bad. The Doc will take care of him. Yeah, well, he learned his lesson. Now he won't talk. Dr. Condon? I'm Dr. Condon, yes. I've got a guy in the car who needs some help. Take a look at him. What happened? I don't know Doc we uh, found him lying on a curb. Yeah, that's right Doc. Uh, you think you two can manage him? I got a bad back. Sure. You can stay where you are. Let's get his coat off. Any identification on him? Oh, we didn't look. We just brought him right here. You, uh, worried about your fee, Doc? Why do you think I leave my light out at night? I need every case I can get. Uh, I'm sure he's got friends or relatives, you'll collect. Uh, there'll have to be an absent report. I need your names. Now I told you, we just found him lying in the curb. There's no sense for us to get involved. We were just trying to do him a good turn. So long Doc. Police department? Police headquarters. This is Dr. Roger Condon. I want to report an emergency. Yeah. I know him. His name is Lou Miles. Detective Lou Miles. We joined the force about the same time. Vice squad. Yeah, but why would anyone do something like this to him? Any idea? Yeah, I have. I don't like to admit it about a fellow cop, but I have. You mean, you know someone who'd want to beat him to death? No. No. No, I didn't say that. I don't think they meant to go that far. You want to kill a guy, you don't go to the trouble of beat his head in first. I think they wanted to shut him up. Want him not to talk. Then his death was accidental. No. No. No, accident. Not in our book. They beat him up, he died. That makes it murder. Murder? You say, you got a good look at the men that bought him here? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, you, uh, like to take a look through our mug pictures? I'll get dressed. This one, help me carry him in and put him on the table. And this one stayed in the car. He seemed to be the boss. Oh, he is. And how he is. Big Jim Craven. Calls all the shots for the crime machine in half a dozen states. He also called the shots for a few guys on the force. Lou Miles, was one of them. Well, I really walked into something. Oh, you did, Doc. J. Rocco here. Miles was on the take from him. He's Craven's big shot in this town. Joe. Get somebody to wake up the DA and tell him I got an air tight murder case against Big Jim Craven and J. Rocco. Motive, Eye witness, positive identification. Right Lieutenant. We've already got a couple of units out to pick up Craven and Rocco. Well, you won't need me anymore then. Are you kidding Doc? You walk out on that street before we put Craven on ice and your life won't be worth a plug nickel. Oh! Oh, I see. Look Doc, you're the key witness in a rough murder case. And without you we don't have a case. And as soon as Craven finds out that Miles is dead, which he probably know already. He'll realize it too. He'd actually kill me to protect himself? Like that. Murder is just simple business procedures to these rats. Yes. What did I get myself into. Carbo. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, I see. Yeah, you do that. We'll put out an APB. Something go wrong? Well, they collared J. Rocco. Craven, got away. Look Doc, I'm sorry about this. Sorrier than I can tell you. But we've got to keep you locked in protected custody until we get Craven. Oh, No. Now wait a minute. I've put in too many years in school I worked like a dog, day and night to build up a practice such as it is and, well, I'm not going to give that up. Look Doc, let me tell you how they work, Craven's not going to come after you himself, he gets on a long distance phone, he calls Cleveland, Chicago, maybe Seattle. And then some guy that never saw you in his life, flies in and... That's all there is to it. Now look, we've got to lock you up under 24 hour guard. No. I am not going to jail because another man commits murder. Now it's, uh... Well, you're the police, it's your duty to protect me. Okay. We'll put a man with you day and night till after the trial. That's the best I can do. - All right, I guess. - That settled it. Police department? Yes? It's Lieutenant Carbo, Doc. You came alone? Black and white car should be here any second. What are you doing? Packing my emergency kit. What for? You won't need it the hotel room. I've got it all arranged. I'm not being locked up, Lieutenant. Jail, hotel room, anywhere. After what's just happened, you going to stay here and let him try again? No, I'm not. I've made lot of plans for my life. Intend to live a long time. So... Thanks a lot, Lieutenant. - For what? - For trying. But I'll take it from here. You mean, your running out? Call it whatever you want! Just suppose, I stop you? You cant. Not without a subpoena. By the time you get one, I doubt you'll find me to serve it. Yeah, but what about our case Doc, your our key witness. How will we contact you? You find Jim Craven, when I read in the papers you got him, I'll return, ready to testify. Until then I... Must be the investigation team. Better let 'em in. Good luck, Doc. You're going to need it. Frank, want to do some business? Well, that's what we're here for, George. Well, you special order this for me in time for opening day. Don't you ever use any standard shells? If I did that, the dudes could walk in the store by themselves. - This way I can charge them double. - Well, I'll do my best. Say, can I see this? - Oh, yeah, go ahead, keep it. I'm finished with it. - Thanks. Oh, as soon as I hear from the old customers I'll be in to pick up their license. Good. Frank. Well, your home early, aren't you? Yes, uh, a little. Nothing happening at the store. It won't be till after the season opens. Oh, nothing happening here ether. Except look, the reservations are just pouring in. If all of these people show, there won't be a deer left in the mountain. You know, I'll never understand men. Tramp all over the mountains, spend hundreds of dollars, risk heart attacks, just to satisfy the urge to kill. Hmm, you're father loves guns Laurie. They're his whole life practically. But not to shoot defenseless animals. They're a hobby like, oh, electric trains or stamps. Not quite. Well, besides he has to have something. Yes, of course. Where's the Colonel, in there? Umm, isn't he always? Afternoon, Colonel. Well, Frank. Your early. Uh, slightly. This came for you today. Um. Oh! Ah, it's my bore siding chart. Bore sighting? Mmm-hmm. Calculating wind and drift. You mean, the wind can, uh, appreciably effect the bullet from a high powered rifle? Oh, you bet. Yeah, at long range shooting, say, 1000 yards with a telescopic sight. If you didn't take any consideration to wind you could miss your target by six feet. Not me. I couldn't see that far, even with contact lenses, let alone shoot at something. Ah, you know Frank, gunnery and marksmanship uh, it's almost a science, like navigation. Well, do you know that in long range artillery fire, we actually have to take into consideration the rotation of the earth? - No, I didn't. - Mmm-hmm, and in ballistic missiles. Well, in order to hit anything, they think you have to be an astrophysicist. - Ha, ha, that lets me out. - Hey, Frank. You spend a lot of time in the woods, don't you? Oh, just hiking, not shooting. Mmm-hmm, yeah, I know. Well, then... You know the season opens next week? I uh... Between now and then, I could make a pretty good marksman out of you. You see, rifle instruction, that was my specialty when I was in the service. - Well, thanks Colonel, but uh... - Frank. A man really needs something that he can... Lose himself in. Something that he really loves to do. Hell, when I got out of the hospital and was retired from the army... If I hadn't had all this, I would have cracked up for sure. Frank, there's an awful lot more in life than just being a clerk in a small town store. Yes. I suppose there is. - Oh, so lonely all by ourselves. - Mmm-hmm. Wait till hunters start rolling in next week. - You'll have all you can do and then some. - Um, I know. Oh, I've asked Mark and Oscar to report for work Sundays, - is that alright? - Oh, sure. Anything you say, dear. After all you're the manager. Funny, I wonder why Frank hasn't come down yet? - I better call him. - Wait. Wait, honey. Sit down. Sit down. Oh wha... Frank knows what time we serve. If he was hungry, I think he'd be here. Laurie, I been meaning to talk to you about Frank. Maybe, ah, maybe right now would be a very good time. What about him? Just how serious is it, between you two? I don't know. I honestly don't. I think it could be serious, at least on my part. - On your part? - Mmm-Hmm. I like Frank and I... Well, I think he likes me. Certainly don't sound very sure. How long have we known Frank, dad? - Almost a year now, isn't it? - Umm. Well, even now if, I try to show any interest in him or if I try to show him any encouragement he, I don't know, he just kind of closes up like a shell. Deliberately keeps me at arm's length. Ooh, I've never had that problem with a man before. You know, I was just thinking, maybe... Maybe it's better that way. Oh, Laurie after all, what do we know about him, hmm? I mean, where he came from? What he is? What do we know about him? Well he doesn't care to talk about himself. All right, let me ask you this then. Does he impress you with the kind of a fellow who would be willing to bury himself in a place like this and work as a clerk in a small town store for the rest of his life, does he now? - No, he doesn't. - All right. Of course he doesn't. Then why is he doing it Laurie, Why? He's educated and it's obvious he's intellectual even. And I can't understand why he wants to bury himself in an out of the way resort like this. Well, I'm sure whatever it is, It's a perfectly simple and obvious reason. Besides, I'm glad he did. Yeah. Well, I won't judge a man, suspicion. But on the other hand, I am not going to let him spoil things for my only daughter, remember that. Yeah. I think maybe we're lucky. Maybe this, arm's length attitude is... All for the best. Uh-uh. Women have too much curiosity. And I'm going to find out. It'll just take me a little time. Beside, I'm not so old. Is that a medical book? Oh, it's, uh, just a book on anatomy. I didn't know you were interested in medicine. Oh, no, it's, uh, just something to read. I wanted to talk to you. Uh, what about? About why you didn't come down to dinner and other things. Well, I wasn't hungry. Are you well? No, I... Well, I had kind of a shock today and I wanted to think about it by myself. Sorry, I hope it wasn't serious. Nothing I cared to talk about. You know, that's just your trouble. What? You never want to talk about anything. You've got a fence around you a mile high. Look, Laurie it's late and if you don't mind I'll... Frank, everyone needs somebody. You can't go through life by yourself. - Whatever a man feels guilty of... - Guilty? Well, I mean, whenever we're in trouble it helps to talk it over with friends. Sometimes they can help make it seem a lot less serious. Frank, we're your friends, dad and I, really we are. I wish you'd believe that. Well, it wouldn't do any good. What wouldn't? My talking to you. You're better off knowing nothing about me. Let's leave it at that. Won't you try to let us help you? I said, leave it alone, Laurie! There's only one person who can help, and he's the last person in the world who would. Good night. You'd never know what hit you. How can you fight? How can we help you? Craven won't give you a choice, Doc. You're hooked. He's after you. 152, code six. 2052, the other was 46 and Broadway. 674. 674... 1XL46. 1XL46, at 4:15... Who is it? Fran. Took you long enough. Drive 200 miles. You seem to think it's easy, to shop in a different town every time. - We got to eat, don't we? - I'm running out of towns. All right. All right, so it isn't easy. You think it's easy for me being stuffed away in this joint? Try to stick my nose out the door, to get a breath of fresh air. You're wanted for murder not me. Shut up! I'm sorry, hun. Forget it. I guess it'd get on anybody nerves. Doctor. That stinking doctor! Made the world too small for him and me to live in at the same time. Boys will find him. Jim, you've got to take it easy. Relax or you'll flip. What was the name of that town that the boys said they were going to go to? Summit City. Yeah, Summit City. Got to find that doctor, Fran. They got to get him. It's either him or me. Yes, sir? Better fill her up. Sure. You know this town pretty well, fella? Lived up here all my life. Many strangers? Hundreds. Every summer for the fishing. Every winter for the deer season. Sounds kind of quiet right now. But wait till next week. The opening day, you'll never recognize it. - You could use a quart of oil. - Good deal. Any ever stay, settle down, year round? Strangers I mean. Oh, a few. Not many, but some. How many would you say in the past year? Oh, four or five maybe. Any of them doctors? No. We can't even keep one doctor busy full time. Ole Dr. Rayburn, from over at Sparta. He comes over on Tuesdays and Fridays. Uh, you owe me $5.60. This Dr. Rayburn... Look anything like this? Nope. He could be this fella's grandfather. You don't know that fella? - I'll get your change. - Forget it. - Oh, thanks. - Any place to stay, settle down for a few days? Are you fellows, hunters? - In a way. - Thinking we might take it up. Oh, fine. There's the Elesmore Motel, right on down the street. Then a couple of miles the other side of town there's uh, Buckhorn Mountain Lodge. Lake View Lodge and summer cabins. - Open country? - Well, not too far. I think maybe we'll try the Motel. - Thanks man. - Sure. You're lucky to get the best room on the Motel without a reservation. And the hunting season starting. Open your bag? Oh, we can do it. Thanks uh... - Uh, George. - George. Guess you can use money well as anybody else, huh, George? More. I got a teepee full of papooses with big appetites and big yens to go to college. How'd you like to work for us? Oh, you hunters? Show him the picture. You know him? No, don't think so. We got a tip, he might show here. You keep your eyes open, let us know if you see him. There's a double sawbuck in it. Oh, you check with the deputy sheriff? Chet Burrows? He's a good man. Ooh! It's kind of private. Kind of confidential. Okay, I'll see what I can do. Why will the Doc pick a jerkwater burg like this to hide out? Craven's paying us. If this is where he wants us to look, this is where we look. Finding anything, that's something else again. Better try the Buckhorn Lodge. Ask some questions. They said you wanted to talk to me. - Yeah, we did. Sit down. - Mmm-hmm. - Cigarette? - Oh, no, thank you. Good chow. We should have stayed here instead at the Motel. They told us in town, you have one fellow living here, year round. Yes, we have one permanent guest. Came to Summit City about a year ago? More or less. - Is he a doctor? - A doctor? Oh, no, no. Frank works at a sporting goods store. Frank Harlow, that's his name. Frank Harlow. Does he look anything like this? No, I'm afraid not. Well, thanks anyway miss. Uh, what's he done? The man in the picture, the doctor? Done? Far as we know, he hasn't done anything. We're insurance men. Investigators. We have to get a signature on a dotted line to settle a claim. That's all. Anything in there? By the looks of this stuff he might have bought it all new since he got into town. Look at that label, Summit City. Nothing but soap. You expect it to smell like a hospital just because the guy is supposed to be a Doc? Nothing. Either he's careful or he's the wrong guy. Take a look in the closet. Hey, Bert! Take a look. Comparative Anatomy. I guess that does it, huh? Summit City public library. I don't know whether it does or whether it doesn't. Maybe. Well, let's show it to Craven. No. Put it back right where it was. If this is our boy, we don't want him missing it and guessing where it is and taking off again. Craven's sure going to hear about this. Take a picture, Mister? - What? - Hold it! Hey... Wait a minute! Here they are. Pictures of all five new guys in town the last year. Now it's up to Craven. - Never figured I'd see those two still in town. - What? Those two. They came in at the middle of the week and started asking me if we had a new doctor in town. Oh, is that so. As it we didn't have enough to keep Dr. Rayburn busy. I tried to talk 'em into staying out for the hunting. They come around the store yet to give you a big order? Uh, no. Uh-uh. Maybe they will. Eight gallons. Uh, Chuck, on second thought, maybe you better fill it up. Sure. - You going someplace? - No. No. No place special. - There. - Hm. You know, I think at least he could be on time for his own birthday. He'll be here. - Here he comes now. - Um. - Oh. - Happy Birthday! From us. What's this all about? A toast. - And then you'll have to blow out your candles. - Mmm-hmm. Oh, there must be some mistake, Laurie, this isn't my birthday. I know, but we thought it would be better to celebrate it now. - Oh, excuse me. - Here. Instead of waiting until all the hunters come pouring in from the city. You couldn't even know the date of my birthday. There's no record. Record? You don't know Laurie, when she wants too she's got a memory like an elephant. Remember last winter you said, "Frank Harlow, was the day the hunting season opened." Oh, I see, I'm... Better be careful of what I say to you. - All right, a toast. - Uh-huh. - To you Frank. - Happy birthday. - Now you better blow out your candles, before they burn out. - Mmm-hmm. This is for you. And many happy returns from us. You bet Frank. Uh, No, no. Wait. Wait. I uh... - Seems to me that its customary to make a wish. - Mmm-hmm. Before you blow. Oh, what a shame. Now you won't get your wish. Too bad. - Excuse me, please. - What? Wait. I wonder what he wished for. Didn't work, did it? All this... He still won't trust us. Yes. Get the door. What is it? What's wrong, Frank? If we offended you I... Offended? No. No, Laurie, I'm very grateful. You're leaving? I was. But I've changed my mind. Why did you want to leave? Because I'm not sure that I have the right to stay. I can't run anymore, Laurie. Tell us about it Frank. Let us help you. You're better off staying away. You're better off not knowing, not getting involved. But I am involved already. How? Because I love you. Oh, I fought against it. I... I didn't want it to happen. Even dad warned me. And I wasn't going to tell you just now. It just came out. We're both involved Laurie. I wasn't going to say anything either. Oh, darling. Oh, Frank, tell me what it is. Now it concerns both of us. I don't care what you've done. You're so sure, I've done something wrong? Haven't you? Maybe. But only to myself. No one else. Frank, tell us what it is. Let us help you. Laurie, a man wants to kill me. And I have no place to go. No place I'd be safe from him. No matter how long it takes, it's my life or his. Well, what about the police? It's because of the police I'm in this mess. You see Laurie, I'm the key witness in a murder case against a man. That man's name is Jim Craven. As long as I'm alive he has to hide. And unless the police find him before he kills me, I have to hide. Now I'm, almost sure that Craven's men have found me. Those two strangers who came here asking questions. They were here too? They hired a little boy to take my picture. Craven couldn't risk coming here himself. Those two men are probably hired killers. Oh, but you said you decided to stay. Craven's already cost me one life, one identity, I'll not sacrifice another. Laurie... You were wrong about my birthday. You said, Frank Harlow was born the day the season opened. I said, he was born the day he arrived in Summit City. There is no Frank Harlow. My name is Roger Condon. Dr. Roger Condon. Hello, Dr. Roger Condon. Why did the boys send five pictures? Well, since we've been hiding out, five new men have settled in Summit City. Anyone of them could have been the Doc so the boys took pictures of 'em all. Now these four are out for sure. And this one with his hands covering his face, who could tell. Then they'll just have to take another picture so we can see his face. Oh, great. And if it was the Doc, what do you suppose he'd do while the boys were taking pictures of him? Eh? Take off like a scared rabbit. We chase him for another year. Wait a minute. What was his name, the guy hiding his face? Frank Harlow. - Yeah, that checks. - What does? Well, the boys found an Anatomy book. The regular doctor's book when they were searching this guy's room. Why would he be reading Anatomy, if he wasn't a doctor? Even more than that, why would he be afraid of a kid with a camera? Why would he cover his face, unless he was hiding up. You're right Jim. It's got to be the right one. Not for sure, not yet. Now there are a lot of guys hiding out in this country. For a lot of reasons. Reading Anatomy books? I admit it's the best lead we've had yet, in almost a year. We can't afford to be wrong! What I'd give for a look at the face behind those hands. Hunting season starts, when did the boys say? - Three days? - That's right. Now look, I'm going to need a... A flannel shirt, whipcord breeches. Uh, high lace boot size nine and a half D. A lumber jacket and one of those red caps with the long beak, you know what I mean? Now here. This ought to cover it. Are you kidding with that kooky outfit? You want me to look good when I go hunting, don't you baby? Yeah, this is a paratrooper's weapons. It's carbine. I carried that little sweetheart, when I made my first training jump. So you uh, you want to know what I think? Yeah, that why Laurie insisted I give you the whole story. Mmm-hmm. Frank... You ever, hear the story about how I got this way? - Well, the war in Korea, that's all you said. - Hmm, yeah. Yeah, I'm not much of a man anymore. Just a collection of wires and Platinum pins and steel plates, I'm sort of all tied together inside. But you know I'm alive. I enjoy being alive. And my main reason... My daughter Laurie. How were you wounded, Colonel? Running away. Oh, yeah, yeah, it was the big retreat in Chosin. You see we hit this roadblock, we took off across this open field and it was mined. Well, I was pretty badly hurt. But my jeep driver, young kid from the Ozarks. Could have gotten away. Only wouldn't run. He came back and he carried me out and I'm alive. He's dead. Yeah, it's funny that... Young kid like that, 19 years old. Had no idea why he was there. He didn't know what the fighting was about. He... Thought he wouldn't run. And you think I was wrong to run away? No. No, from what you told me I uh... I don't think you had much of a choice. But there's just one thing, it wouldn't make any difference. You just can't run far enough, you see. Somewhere, sometime, you would have had to make your stand. I'm awful glad you decided to make it right here with us. No, wait a minute Colonel, Laurie knows how I feel about you two getting involved. I told dad. He doesn't care. Frank. Frank, come here. You're not going to deprive me, are you? Now of my one chance to be useful again? Eh? Now offer, whatever we're worth, you can count on us. Thank you. Oh, thanks dear. Frank are you sure there isn't something the Sheriff could do? What could he do? Pick up the killers? On what charge? They haven't made a move against me. Even if they were picked up, Craven would just hire somebody else to come and get me. And in the meantime, I would have given myself away. Craven will be sure, who I was and where I was. Oh, you can't just wait here for them to kill you. Laurie, if I knew how to fight them, I wouldn't have run in the first place. Laurie. - They're out front. Both of them. - Don't look at them. They've been doing that from the past two days, walking up and down in front of the store. Well, they're watching you. Trying to make sure I don't run away. They haven't made a move. But, if they know - you're in here... - I've been thinking about that too. It seems to me there's only one answer. There're not sure. Not, not sure, you're the man they're after? Well, they must know, that I know about them asking questions. Trying to take my picture. But I haven't run, and that's what confuses them. There're thinking I might be the wrong man. And until they're sure, they have no reason to kill me. But if you mean so much to them, well, they won't let you get away. They'll try to make sure. The only person who can really identify me is Craven. Laurie, that might be the answer. Craven, has to see me. He has to be sure. He has to come out in the open. He has to make the move! And that's how I can fight him. We'll let him come to me. Make him come to me. Oh, then there'll be three of them. Three killers. And three of us now. A cripple and a girl to help you? You and your father gave me two wonderful reasons not to run away. Why I've got to stay alive. I can't rationalize that way Frank, I'm scared. It's got to be this way. I'm the bait in the trap. Let's just see how far Jim Craven will go before he, realizes that the hunted has become the hunter. Yeah? George, the bellman. Fella out here who wants to see you. Says he's a friend. What friend? He says you're expecting him. Name is Mr. Booth. - It's the big man. - Sticking his neck out like that. Hello, boys. Forget I was coming? We didn't expect you so soon. Oh, thanks Mr. Booth. Okay, George. We want anything we'll call ya. Well, not after tonight. Why not, you quitting? I start hiring out as a guide. Let's say, if you haven't already got a guide Mr. Booth, maybe we can talk some business. Yeah, maybe we'll talk about it later. A man can get lost real easy in them woods. Uh-uh, we'll remember that. Never expecting you to show yourself Mr. Craven. Mr. Booth! - Yeah, Mr. Booth. - Don't forget it! What's the rundown on this one? Frank Harlow. You think, he might be the Doc? Yeah, it could be. But with his face half hidden behind his hand, who could tell for sure. I only saw him myself for a couple of minutes. Came to town little less than a year ago. Works at the Sporting Goods Store. Lives at Buckhorn Lodge. What else? Sticks pretty much to himself. Doesn't talk much. Nobody seems to know where he came from or why he ended up here. And why he reads Anatomy books and why he hides his face when he see a camera, eh? Where's he now, still in town? Last time we checked. We've been checking twice a day. Did he... Did he see you? Like I wanted him too. He saw us all right. Uh, now I don't know. If he was the Doc, why didn't he scare and take off? Why would he stay? Because he could be the wrong guy. I want to get a good look at his face. Without anybody knowing that I'm here. Without him getting suspicious. How? Look I'm paying you a lot of good money. If I don't think of something, you better. Well, today is the big day, huh George? You can always tell when he gets the coontail cap out of mothballs. Well, I have to wear it. Self-defense. - Self-defense? - Yeah. Makes me look like an animal. You know, those dudes never hit animals, all they hit are other hunters. Whatever they shoot, they got to have licenses. How about your clients George? Yeah, I picked up five tickets yesterday from Frank. They're here. - Here they are, checked off on the list. - Oh, yeah. Oh, Frank, uh, you got that special order? All ready for you. Hello. Yes, sir. I'd be very happy to. Fine. Well, I'll bring it all over as soon as the boss gets back to handle the store. Well, anytime now. Opening days are our busiest season. Sure, goodbye. Everything there George? Yeah, looks okay. Say, George uh, do you have a fellow named Booth at the Motel? - Yeah, checked in last night. - Oh. Oh, well, that was Booth on the phone. Wants me to bring a complete outfit over to the Motel room. Guns, shells, gamebag, they're worth to what is to be a three four hundred dollar sale. Why didn't he come here? Well, he's waiting for friends. He said, he wanted to leave from the Motel. Well, that lets me up. I figured, I'd pick up an extra couple of dollars guiding him. Say, according to this list, this Booth doesn't have a license yet. Oh. I'll drop over the Motel and remind him. Now, here's the license money. Tell him I'll get the stuff up there, soon as I get away. Sure thing, Frank. So long. Why Dr. Rayburn. We never expect you until 11. - I know, but this is opening day. - Ooh. You know, I've had my eye on a prime eight point Buck up there on south peaks so I thought I'd come out early and sneak in ahead of the mob and pick him off. Well, we will have time for our weekly cup of coffee. Won't we after you examine father? Oh, I might miss that Buck. I hope the poor thing does get away. Has the Colonel been behaving himself? No excitement? No violent exercise? Well, he hasn't been running the mile too often lately. Hello, men. I'm Chet Burrows, Deputy Sheriff and Game Warden of these parts. I heard you men were hunters, so I thought I drop by to remind you to pick up your licenses. Now get back! Craven. Jim Craven. My name's Booth. I've seen your wanted posters long enough. If your name is Booth, you can prove it down at my office. Okay, let's go. Stupid hick, he had to stick his nose in. What do we do? Get rid of him, what else. Take him down the woods. Make him look like a hunting accident. With all those guns going off down there, they won't hear another shot. Here, put my coat and hat on him. If anybody asks any questions, or sees you, it'll look like Mr. Booth's got a load on. Hurry back, that chode from the store gets here, I don't want to meet him alone. Come on. Come on. Get him out of here. - Ah, it's a beautiful day for opening, eh? - Sure. Well, Doc, I hope we didn't hold you up too long. No, but I better be on my horse or that Buck is going to be making tracks into the next county. Well, I for one, hope you get him. And remember, if you do. We like venison, hear? I'll save you a whole quarter. - Well, I'll see you folks next week. - All right, Doc. - Good bye Dr. Rayburn. - Good bye. Gotta look like he was standing. Put him up against that tree. Now stand back quick before he falls. Better give one more and make sure. A guy don't get hit twice in one accident. Hello! Anything wrong? Smedley! Mr. Smedley, where are you? Mr. Smedley! Mr. Smedley, where are you? Mr. Smedley! Mr. Smedley, where... Sheriff! George. How bad is it? Bad. Well, I better not move you. I'll go get doc Rayburn. - Frank, we've got to get doc Rayburn. - What, an accident all ready? Chet, he's out in the woods, shot through the middle, bad. It's almost 11. He's due at the Lodge to check on the Colonel. Give me the Lodge please. It's doc Rayburn's day to be in town. Hello, Laurie, has doc Rayburn arrived there yet? He what! He got there early and left to go hunting. He said, he was going up on south peak, after a Buck he saw there. South peak? George, if you could get up there? Yeah, thanks Laurie, I'll let you know. Well, we can't leave him out there alone. Grab that kit, will you? Where is he? Near the bend on the road to the Lodge. Clear in just off the left side, you'll find him. Ooh! Hi, Frank. Where's doc Rayburn? Don't talk. George, has gone after him. Where? Rayburn's hunting. Frank it's bad! I need a doctor. No, Frank, you can't do anything, you'll just make it worse. - Relax Chet. - No! No! Leave me alone! Let the doctor take care of it! Relax, I am a doctor. You, a doctor? Got to get you back to the Lodge. The Lodge? Yeah, my things are there. What's keeping Harlow? I've been waiting for over an hour. Maybe something's cooking. Take a walk down past the store. See if he's still around. He's giving me the jumps! Are you sure nobody saw you get rid of that death? Sure. We would have heard about it by now, if they did. Help me get him inside. Oh, it's such a bad wound, Frank. He'll be all right. Frank, what's the situation? We'll have to draw the fluid from his lungs before he drowns. - I'll have to operate right away. - But how? My emergency kit, it's hidden in the basement. But what about Craven? If he knows about what you've done, he'll know you're a doctor. Not much I can about that now. I'll use the big carpenter's bench down there. It'll have to as an operating table. Frank, what can I do to help, isn't there something? Yes, I'll need a strong lamp, clean sheets, towels and blankets. All right fine. I'll get em for you, right away. If he's really on the run, do you think he'll stop off the Lodge? Got any other ideas? How's this? Just fine. Breadth deep, Chet. How did the accident happen? It wasn't an accident, Laurie. Chet, told me all about it. Jim Craven's here in town. His killers tried to murder him. Frank, if Craven's here wha... I can handle things now, Laurie. You go upstairs and stay with your father. Make things look normal. Do you think he'll come here? He came to Summit City for one reason. He knows I live here. Laurie, I wanted it this way. I wanted him to be out in the open. We'll just have to wait and see. Oh. Well, I'll go upstairs. They're coming! You've got a fellow named Frank Harlow, living here. His car is outside, where's his room. He isn't here right now. Bert. Now, hold it right there, all of you! You know Craven, I know how to use this. Now don't force me to prove it. Drop it, Pops! Drop it now! I'm not waiting Pops, we're busy guys. No, dad! Don't. Don't. Don't. Lock her in there. What about the gimp? He won't bother anybody now. No, no, please. Let me go! No don't! - Harlow's key was in the box. - Let's go. Place smells like a hospital. Hospital? Well, what do you know. He must have made it to the woods. - Laurie. - Oh, dad, are you all right? Yeah, dear, I'm fine. Now, but I think Frank's in trouble. - Oh. - Wait a minute. Wait till I get my rifle. Doc! Hey, Doc! I can hear you, Craven. You want to know something? I'm sorry about all this. That cop wasn't supposed to die. If he hadn't, I wouldn't be here now. Neither would you. Are you apologizing for wanting to kill me? The way things are I can't let you live. Not if I want to live myself. Does that mean the girl and father have to die too? Are you going to apologize to them Craven? Bert! If he had a gun, he would have used it by now. Go get him! I'll get you, Doc, don't you forget it! This is only round one! Round two, Craven. You want to know something? I'm not sorry about this. I can't even apologize. Out. Where's Chet? In the basement. - Oh. - Ah. Hey, hey... Hey, eh? - Good shooting Colonel. - You bet.
