The kids did that. Wait. Where are the kids? -Oh, yeah. -Do they have after school sports? Never mind. I heard what I just said. What is that noise? -There's a noise? -Yeah, you don't hear it? It's a beeping. I might be too old to hear beeping. It's over here. Oh, my God, Bob! The talent show! At the school! That's where the kids are. I set an alarm on my phone so we'd know when to go! -Oh, no. -How long has it been going off? Oh, God, what time is it? We gotta go, Bob! We gotta go! Okay, okay. Okay, Belchers. -It says here you're doing a song? -Big time. And it hasn't changed since rehearsal. -There was a rehearsal? -Good, good. So, you know the rules.
