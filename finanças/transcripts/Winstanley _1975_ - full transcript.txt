(Laughter) I think that the poorest He that is in England has a life to live as the greatest He. No person has a right to a share in the kingdom that has not a permanent fixed interest in the kingdom. I wonder we soldiers were so deceived. There are many in my condition.

And there, likewise, by the burden of taxes and much free quarter, my weak back found the burden heavier than I could bear. Yet not a full year since, being quiet at my work, my heart was filled with sweet thoughts, and many things were revealed to me which I never read in books nor heard from the mouth of any flesh. And when I began to speak of them, some people could not bear my words. And amongst those revelations, this was one: That the earth shall be made a common treasury of livelihood to the whole of mankind, without respect of persons. And I had a voice within me bade me declare it all abroad, which I did obey. Then I was made to write a little book, called The New Law of Righteousness, and therein I declared it. Yet my mind was not at rest, because nothing was acted and thoughts ran in me that words and writings were all nothing, and must die, for action is the life of all, and if you do not act, you do nothing. All men have stood for freedom. Plenty of petitions and promises have been made for freedom, and now the common enemy is gone you are all like men in a mist, seeking for freedom, and knowing not where, nor what it is. For freedom is the man that will tum the world upside down. Therefore, no wonder he has enemies. We thank thee for thy life, health, peace and food and all thy glories given to us. Through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen. Good day, Mistress Platt. Have the children been fed? Yes, Mistress. (Slurps) Margaret, I am beset with trouble. Margaret? Yes, John. I'm listening. You are not listening, you are reading. And I know what you are reading. What have I done that you are so little wife to me? (Door slams) The work we are going about is this - to dig up George's Hill and the waste ground thereabouts, and to sow com and eat our bread together by the sweat of our brows. And the reason is this: That we may work in righteousness, and lay the foundation of making the earth a common treasury for all, both rich and poor. That everyone that is born in the land may be fed by the earth, his mother, that brought him forth, according to the reason that rules in the creation. Not enclosing any part into any particular hand, but all as one man, working together and feeding together as sons of one father, members of one family, not one lording over another but all looking upon each other as equals in the creation. (Wind howls) Mr Winstanley, might I trouble you for a few words? Why, Parson Platt, of course. The weather is unusual for the time of the year. An early spring is surely a sign? A sign? A sign of what, pray? Of God's mercy. Ah. I see, God is merciful. Let us pray that the Almighty will grant us a better harvest. I doubt that the poor can endure another year of ruin. Are the poor so large in your thoughts, then, Parson? I consider godliness in poor men a most estimable and useful quality. However, in men of substance, it is more conspicuous. As lord of the manor and parson, you have much to thank God for. As Luther said, here I stand! This is my flock! I am ordained. England is infected with a plague of ignorant, ranting hedge-preachers. You have already seduced ten of my flock from out of my church by your ravings. You unhinge minds already rendered weak by poverty and ignorance. Then the fault lies in poverty and ignorance! (Chatter and laughter) WOMAN: Mr Winstanley? I would speak with you. If I may be of service. Please, enter. COACHMAN: Go on! (Horse whinnies) I have read your book. I have read it so often I know it by heart. The voice of God speaks in you, and through you. You cannot conceive the degree of my suffering. There is a favour I must ask of you. One you cannot deny me before God. I shall join your flock. I, too, shall dig. I am with child, but when... Our life is hard. (Bird caws) Ssh. (Child grizzles) Friend, is this yours? I'm Gerrard Winstanley. - You? - Yes. I wrote it. Have you come to join the Diggers? You are most welcome. True religion and undefiled is this. To let everyone quietly have earth to manure that they may live in freedom by their labours. Do not all strive to enjoy the land? The gentry strive for land, the clergy strive for land, the common people strive for land. And buying and selling is an art whereby people endeavour to cheat one another of the land. Now, if any can prove from the Law of Righteousness that the land was made peculiar to him, and his successively, shutting out all others, he shall enjoy it freely, for my part. But I affirm it was made for all, and true religion is to let everyone enjoy it. Therefore, you rulers of England, make restitution of the land which the kingly power holds from us. Set the oppressed free, and come in and honour Christ, who is the restoring power, and you shall find rest. (Wood chopping) Skin and bone. Come on. We'll find you a house. (Sobs) Please don't cry. You'll be well looked after now. Aagh! (Laughter) (Curses) (Low chatter in distance) (Bird flies up) (Battle cries) (Screaming) (Screams) I have with me a justice of the peace. Although you have done serious wrong in trespassing on another's land, common land, owned by Francis Drake, Esquire, the action taken against you was not in accordance with the law, and consequently, I have no alternative but to release you. Look! They live like pigs. (Distant shouting) Look, there. (Piper plays) You certainly do, but I'm not going to tell him. (Laughter) Let us give thanks. (Shrill whistle) Come on! Hurry! Brothers! Brothers! You are welcome! You have come to join us. I see it writ plainly on your faces. - You have come to cast off the... - Who is leader here? I- This man we acknowledge as our inspiration. I am here by command of Lord General Fairfax. You are trespassing. I have a warrant for your dispersal from the Council of State. Trespassing. Trespassing! We, the common people, trespassing on common land which we own? Is not the meaning of the word 'common" clear? It belongs to all. But to Mr Francis Drake, in particular. Have you and I, the common people of England, fought a bloody war for nothing? Have we just served one lot of gentry against another? So, friends, you would turn your sword blades on us - defenceless men, who fought by your sides in the war. So would you cut down poor women and children? This is madness. Where are your crops? You'll not grow anything here. Not in this dust. Then let nature disperse us. We'll come to the General, Everard and I, and explain ourselves to him. (Murmurs of approval) Good day, gentlemen. We observe you do not remove your hats in the Lord General's presence. He is but a fellow creature. Give honour where honour is due. Would you kindly explain your mission? First we will have our hats. To keep our brains warm. Hold your tongue. Our hats. Return their hats. Now, gentlemen, will you please come to the point? Sir, we violate no man. We dig upon the commons in peace. Many local gentlemen and freeholders have complained to the Council of State that you are tumultuous, and a danger to the county. You are clearly infringing the laws and must disperse. The abomination of the law is dead with the King! Divide England into three parts. Scarce one part is manured, so that here is land enough to maintain all her children. Yet many starve for want, or live under a heavy burden all their lives. And this misery the poor have brought upon themselves through lifting up particular interest by their labours. Common land is for grazing cattle, not ploughing. As soon as one man digs, he digs for himself. Cattle, on the other hand, do not discriminate. The law is perfectly sensible. Communal living is just an excuse for idleness. Let a man work on his own behalf, then he'll work hard enough. But the rich, sir, the lords and gentry, they do no work. They live on rents. But they have to attain their position, damn it, and hold it. And that requires more skill than you can lay claim to. Was the earth made to preserve a few covetous and proud men to live at ease? To bag and barn up the treasures of the earth from others, that these should beg and starve in a fruitful land? So you would seize their property and own it for yourself? We offer no offence to any, but do carry ourselves in love and peace toward all, having no intent to meddle with any man's property, till it be freely given by themselves to us. The earth, sirs, was made to be a common treasury for all. What do you propose to do? To earn our bread by the sweat of our brow. Well... strive to preserve the peace. That is all I charge you with. Thank you, sir. And when the Lord thy God shall deliver mine enemies before thee, thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them. Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them but thus shall ye deal with them. Ye shall destroy their altars and cut down their crops and bum their graven images with fire. For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God. (Church bells) This is not our battle. 'Tis a battle for the whole of England! - Is it over, then, Tom? - No, they haven't all flown. You gentlemen of Surrey, and you Parson Platt especially, my advice to you is this: Hereafter to lie still and cherish the Diggers. For they love you and would not have your finger to ache if they could help it. Why should you be so bitter against them? Let them live beside you. Some of them have been soldiers and some countrymen that were always friends to the Parliament's cause, by whose hardships and means you enjoy the creatures about you in peace. And will you now destroy part of them that have preserved your lives? Do not do so. Be not so besotted with the kingly power. Hereafter, let not attorneys or lawyers neatly counsel your money out of your purse, and stir you up to beat and abuse the Diggers to make all rational men laugh at your folly, and condemn you for your bitterness. If you have yet so much money, give it not away to destroy men, but give it to some of the poor and bid them go and plant the commons. This will be your honour and your comfort. Assure yourselves you never must have true comfort till you be friends with the poor. For what would you do if you had not such labouring men to work for you? Come on, all of you. Put the wood that's any good for building somewhere. No man can be rich, but he must be rich either by his own labours, or by the labours of other men helping him. If a man has no help from his neighbour, he shall never gather an estate of hundreds and thousands a year. If other men help him to work, then are those riches his neighbours' as well as his. For they be the fruit of other men's labours as well as his own. Here, Gustav. Here, Adolphus! Here! So you are Mr Winstanley. I am pleased to make your acquaintance, sir. My wife. You may feel flattered. They're usually frightened of strangers. I must confess, we've heard so much about you. We are quite distracted with curiosity. It was a most unchristian act. They behaved with more passion than good sense. Yet one cannot condemn them entirely, any more than one can condemn you. They too must live from the land, yet you drive their cattle from the commons. - Our commons. - You cut their wood. You poach freely. They are simple people, Mr Winstanley. WINSTANLEY: Here is waste land enough and to spare to supply all our wants. We are to blame. We failed to evict you, as was our duty, feeling you would do no harm. The villagers, alas... Let us close our differences and restore our little world to its proper harmony. We desire no more of you than the freedom to work. If you deny this freedom, you must raise collections for the poor. Many are ashamed to take collection money, therefore they are desperate, and would rather rob and steal. Others that are ashamed to beg would do any work in order to live as is the case with many of our Diggers. But if this freedom of the commons were granted, we should have no beggars or idle persons in the land. Our justices, do they not administer poor relief most charitably? No freeborn Englishman should need to live by charity! It is a stain on the Christian religion in England that there is so much waste land, and so many starve for want. Then you are no Christian, Mr Winstanley. For surely you know that charity is the command of the Lord. In His wisdom, He has instituted these inequalities which you so rail against that men may obey this command. Blessed is he that giveth and he that receiveth. If all were levelled to a level according to your preaching, it would be an end to charity. The President of the Council of State is much alarmed with your activities, and has warned us: Should your trespass continue, we must seek to take legal resort against you. You must understand, we are called, each of us, to serve in his proper station. The ministers who preach up the law of the Scriptures lay claim to heaven after they are dead. And yet they require their heaven in this world too, and grumble mightily against the people that will not give them a large temporal maintenance. Yet they tell the poor people that they must be content with their poverty, and they shall have their heaven hereafter. But why may we not have our heaven here, as well as you? Devoting ourselves and all our receivings to Thy glory, in the name of Jesus Christ our saviour. Amen. Now, let's see how well you know your catechism. Against how many sorts of men doth Isaiah pronounce woe in Chapter 5? Five. Which are the first? Ex... - (Whispers) - Extortioners. Which are the second? - Drunkards. - And the third? John! Enticers of vanity. And the fifth? Arrogant contemners of government. Woe unto them who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own thoughts. (Giggles) (Groans) Is it time? Parson, it may be time. This is the day I'm to go to the hill. My dear, God is with you. (Whistles) My lord, permit me to suggest you do not listen to their speeches. You do not trust me, Mr Platt. You are a man of great mercy. And you? I, sir, obey a sterner law. Your Excellency, this is Thomas Haydon, a sergeant in your army for seven years. He was in your ranks at Marston Moor and Colchester and holds you in the highest esteem. Perhaps His Excellency will honour us with a visit to our little settlement. Sir, we are due in Hounslow. Come, show me round. No, gentlemen. I would not wish you to tire yourselves. If you would come this way, sir. I'm proud to have you. We began by thatching the huts ourselves. (Pigs grunt) Over here is the first hut we completed. AS you can see, it is well but crudely built. Are wives held in common too, Mr Winstanley? Ask them, sir. Can each woman point to one man who is her husband? (Murmurs of agreement) - What is your trade, friend? - I'm a woodcutter. Good day. - He's sleeping well. - Yes, sir. - Fine-looking child. - Thank you, sir. Perhaps Your Excellency would care to taste this. I hope you put some salt in it. Mm. Good. I was with you at Marston, sir. Old friend. - Are you well? - Oh, not bad, sir. I don't do much here. I'm well looked after. Fine pigs, friend. Where did you get them? You mustn't ask an old soldier where he gets his pigs from. - Whose house is this? - Er... two families. Well built. - Can I see inside? - Please. Well-built house. This contagious incendiary is puffed up with devilish self-love and vainglory. On the other hand, they carry themselves civilly and have the report of honest, sober men. Perhaps the greater villains are the envious inhabitants hereabouts who pull up the Diggers' barley before the first green shoots have appeared. If it be a case for the law, then take it to the law. I shall leave Captain Gladman in the village with five troopers. - You will be protected. - But shall we be protected? It is God's Army, Mr Winstanley. Did not General Cromwell say so?

The righteous can do no sin. We are the chosen of God, so that all that we do cannot be sin but righteousness. The Virgin Mary was but a common whore, her son a fleshly creature, such as we. This, the Holy Bible, has been the cause of all the misery, bloodshed and division in the world. - Until all Bibles are burned... - No, no, no. 'Tis a Holy Bible. - Yippee! - Please! A pack of lies! This book belongs to us. Ranters, self-ended spirits. Why do you fear us so? We have nought but love for you. Talking of love is no love. These are gentle people. If you would stay with us, pray honour and respect them. (Baby gurgles) Good afternoon, Parson. Good afternoon, Parson. Ah. Captain Gladman. Good afternoon. I was far away. No further than I would wish to be. My wife - she's given me a son. I'm very happy. Ah, the third, Parson? We've been so blessed. Oh, well, we're all human, that's what I say. Mind you, the Papists say it takes a priest's mind off his job. (Clears throat) Doubtless you have some business with me, Captain Gladman. They're cutting wood on Stoke Common. My wood! A timely measure might prevent it. Where will it end? Captain Gladman, I really feel that this is your responsibility. (Low discussion) The Lord General would be most displeased were he to learn... Do not look for a God now, as formerly you did, to be a place of glory beyond the sun, moon and stars, nor imagine a divine being you know not where, but you see him ruling within you, and not only in you, but you see and know him to be the spirit or power that dwells in every man and woman. Yea, in every creature within the globe of creation. Now you are enlightened, now you are saved, and rise higher and higher into life and peace as this manifestation of the Father increases and spreads within you. Food! Right. Aargh! - (Cries out) - Come along, now. - Watch him! Watch him! - (Shouting) Watch him! - (Shouting) - Get him! (Boy cries out) (Laughter) - Round and round! - Watch him, watch him! Watch him! (Low conversation) (Laughter) (Fire crackling) (Door handle rattles) MRS PLATT: Murderer. Time and time again we've been beaten. (Men talk at once) This is part of a plan to discredit us. This was the act of a few irresponsible soldiers under that Captain Gladman. (Angry voices overlap) Love must govern our actions. You attack our children because you know we have no redress against you. FAIRFAX: I did not attack the boy, Mr Winstanley. Is a commander not responsible for the actions of his subordinates? I understand your grief. But I must remind you again that these people are trespassers. You have no legal case. We have a moral case, Your Excellency. I will look into it. Sir, we are in grave danger from your Captain Gladman. I want an assurance that we will no more be molested by your soldiery. For lawbreakers, you take a very high-handed tone. My lord, we are wronged, we are mutilated, we suffer one churlish attack after another. I came to you because in you alone I have some hopes of justice. On two occasions, you have shown us Christian charity when your advisers urged against it. It takes a rare and courageous man to do this. I ask you now to consider not some outdated law, but reason, equity and justice. Very well. This will not happen again. You have my word. (Thunder rumbles) (Flies buzzing) (Clinking) (Clinking) (Carriage trundles away) WINSTANLEY: We, Thomas Haydon, Henry Bickerstaffe and Gerrard Winstanley are summoned into Kingston court for a trespass in digging upon George Hill, being the rights of Mr Drake, the lord of that manor. That all men may see we are neither ashamed, nor afraid to justify the cause we are summoned for, therefore we deliver ourselves to the court, although we know lawyers love money as dearly as a poor man's dog do his breakfast on a cold morning. England is a prison. The variety of subtleties in the laws preserved by the sword are the bolts, bars and doors of the prison. The lawyers are the jailers, and poor men are the prisoners. For let a man fall into the hands of any from the bailiff to the judge, and he is either undone or weary of his life. RECORDER: Octavo die Septembri versu manucaptores ad quem diem manicaptor attulit in curia prefatum Henricum Bickerstaffe, superquo ad petitionem querentis predictus Henricus committitur. Habeat diem in vicesimo primo die Augusti... ...ad quem diem defendens nihil dicit... ASSISTANT: ..ideo intret judicium. Querens petit venire facias retornabile vicesimo octabo... - We are waiting, sir... - Silence! Waiting? To know what is laid at our charge. Who is their attorney? We will speak for ourselves. Do not waste the time of this court. Sir, we cannot and will not fee an attorney. We know of no lawyer we can trust with the business. This case cannot proceed until your lawyer can speak for you. We desire the Declaration against us. We will pay for it if necessary. The cause is not entered. You will return tomorrow with an attorney. You have not appeared. (Owls hoots) I am not empowered to hear your case until you have a lawyer to speak for you. You will return in three days. (Wind whistles) Sir, this is the third time you have summoned us here! With what funds should we fee a lawyer? We could, of course, pay them in barley had not those in the pay of Parson Platt and Mr Drake several times ravaged our crops. I must repeat to you, as I have endeavoured to make clear upon each occasion, that the court cannot proceed until you have a qualified lawyer to speak your case. Sir! You may not speak without one and thus make a mockery of this court. I will not have it. We shall proceed to judgment in your absence. In four passages, you have gone against your own... Silence! (Commotion) WINSTANLEY: Ten pounds damages, 29 shillings and a penny costs. Enough for a poor man's family to live on for a year. - (Lowing) - Oi! O, oi! Oi! WINSTANLEY: One moment! One moment. I wonder if perhaps you might take something else? - Who are you? - Winstanley. No. 'Tis your cows we must seize. But these do not belong to me. 'Tis cows we must have. My door is open. Take what you please. No. 'Tis your cattle we must seize. Take me. I will go to Kingston to speak to the Norman barons. No, no. 'Tis your cows we must have. Then I beg of you. Do not hit them. They are neither beggars nor vagrants. BAILIFF: Oi! Come back! (Lowing) And so I went away and left them, saying that if I could not get meat to eat, I would feed upon bread, milk and cheese. And if they take the cows and I cannot feed upon this, then I'll feed upon bread and beer till the King of Righteousness clears up my innocence and the justice of his own cause. And if this be taken from me, then I'll stand still and see what he will do with me, for as yet I know not. RANTER: And what have we to eat tonight? (Slurps) Magnificent repast! How well provided for are we! Gerrard Winstanley is a matchless commissary general. (Bowl clatters) And where have I been today? Is your only remedy for hunger to steal from other poor folk, and place your comrades in greater peril? Don't round on me with your holy wrath. Action is the life of all things. And not to act is to do nothing. Those words are Gerrard Winstanley's. The holiness and righteousness of Gerrard Winstanley will not fill your bellies tonight. He loves himself above all others, and would have you do the same... - (Baby cries) -...even if you starve. There is a vainglory nursed in his heart by which his name might be great amongst the poor of the nation. That is why you dig! That is why you go hungry. Is there nobody you love more? Let us give thanks. - Oi, here! - (Girl squeals) (Dripping) Show me a friendly face in this ruffian's hall of hell! Ah... Will. Well, Winstanley. See who's here. Will Everard! (Exchange of greetings) (Woman laughs) You old... HAYDON: Whatever possessed you to leave us? - (Laughter) - First things first. I must leave again tomorrow. And now... (Gasps of shock) WOMAN: Oh, my Lord. - (Excited murmuring) - Ooh! I bring you greetings... - from the Diggers! - Diggers? - From the Diggers at Aylesbury. - (Excited whispering) From the Diggers of Shrewsbury. And Dunstable in Bedfordshire. - Wellingborough in Northamptonshire. - WOMAN: Oh! Bosworth in Leicestershire. (Excited whispering continues) Cox Hall in Kent, and Iver in Buckinghamshire. The fire has spread. (Distant chopping) MAN: Gerrard? WINSTANLEY: May we give you food? I need rest. Mistress Mather will look after you. (Low conversation) (Coughs) (Hacking cough) (Creaking) (Gasps) For after our work of the earthly community is advanced, we must make use of gold and silver as we do of other metals, but not to buy and sell withal. For buying and selling is the great cheat that robs and steals the earth one from another. It is that which makes some lords, some beggars, some rulers, others to be ruled. That will make no earthquake in their ear. We must go at it as a bull at a cow. None of this butterfly taffety. Perhaps... If I might... I feel you are misled. Does not Mr Milton say... 'What stirs the Englishman sooner to rebellion than violent and heavy hands upon his goods and purses?' Have all things common, or else the plagues of God will rot and consume all that you have. Deliver your money to rogues and cutpurses, who are ready to starve in plaguey jails and nasty dungeons. Who is this? So this is your wife of whoredom! (Murmuring) (Ranter laughs manically) (Laughs) Touch not the flesh of God! Touch not the flesh of God! (Laughs) Touch not the flesh of God! Touch not the flesh of... (Laughs manically) Those very men who punish others for theft... - (Thud, man cries out) -...do thieve and rob as judges and lawyers that take bribes and take their client's money and through neglect lose their cause. Parliament and army live in theft when they take... Aargh! - Come here! - (Shrieks) (Shrieks and laughs) (Laughter) (Ranter babbles) That's not the voice of God. (Shrieks) Communal wives, communal living, the children bastards. Shameless, godless, they live like animals! John, I entreat your forgiveness. I have sinned exceedingly against you. I thought you unjust. PLATT: Mohammed had as mean and as despicable beginning as this self-styled prophet, and his damnable infection has spread over the face of half the universe. How can you restrain the use of force when the law of the land is broken? They are men of peace. (Chair scraping) I will show you, my lord, that they are not. (Coughing) BICKERSTAFFE: It's Tom Haydon. (Murmuring) HAYDON: The ban is on again. We cannot buy in Cobham, nor in Kingston, nor in Walton. The Cobham shopkeepers must give us food and clothing for the winter. WINSTANLEY: Under no law are we justified in forcing shopmen to give us goods without payment. Next spring, when our crop flourishes, all will be repaid. What has Parson Platt preached all along? That our respect for possession is nothing more than a cloak, to be thrown off when it suits us. We have turned the cheek once too often. Soon we shall be without a face. You are free men. I say only this to you. Forcible persuasion is a sin against universal love, against your families and against your fellow Diggers. Are we to do nothing but watch our children sicken and die? Take this step and our work here is finished. Unless we break the trading ban, we are faced with a winter of utter ruin. By doing this, not only Parson Platt but General Fairfax and the army will move against us. Fairfax understands. He is a solider. We were all together once. They hang men for less! Gerrard! This breach between us is of your making. Your piety is fine and good but it does nothing for my son. He is sick, he is hungry and I will not stand to see him suffer so. Tom, do not go. This hour is sent to test our courage and our strength. The decision is mine and mine alone. Who is with me? - We have no choice. - I'm with you. Me too. You have no wife, you have no son, you cannot understand. (Wind howls) (Distant bell tolls) (Door opens) (Door slams shut) FAIRFAX: The soldiers will have orders merely to support the sheriff. What mortal sin do we commit? One may search the Scriptures... Mr Winstanley, let us bring this matter to a head. If you can make good your action by the power of the Scriptures, I will trouble you no more. If you can show me that the Bible supports you, I will cast in all my estates and become one with the Diggers. There is not the least tittle spoken that one part of mankind should subdue and rule in oppression over another. Upon our discourse, Parson Platt seemed to consent to many things and was very moderate, and promised me to read it over and give me an answer. Moreover, he promised me that if the Diggers would not cut the wood upon the commons he would not pull down their houses. And the Diggers resolved for peace sake to let the wood alone till people did understand their freedom a little more. Parson Platt and the soldiers. (Low chatter) - Wait. - My lord!
