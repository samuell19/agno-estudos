Why are you doing this to us? Help me! You scum! You killed him. Jin Ho! -=H.I.Y.A=- Nice to meet you, I'm Lee Ho Won from Cheongdo. I'm the Sesame Leaf Girl. Hello, I'm Lee Jin Ho, the Hoya (rapper) of Chongdo. I'd like to sing a song I composed. ♪ I am ♪ I'm going to perform for all the judges present today. Nice to meet you. Kim Yong-man! Look at you enjoying life with my money. Is the food here? Lee Jin Sang, it's been a while. Run, Jin Sang. Holy crap! Lee Jin Sang! How could you dash out like that? Ajeossi, are you okay? Did you get hurt? Filthy liars! How dare you cheat our money with this fake document! - What are we supposed to do now? - Get those thieves to come out now! Give us our money back! Where were you? What took you so long? Where? Where those filthy crooks? Bring them out now! Give me back my money!! Give me my money...! Give it back! Give me my money back! ~Cheongdo Police Station~ You were promoted easily in Seoul. Why would you volunteer to come here and be some small town cop? Why do this to yourself? I ask the question here. Where's axe? You'd better cooperate while I'm asking you nicely. Where's axe? Out of my way, punk! Ajumma, where's my money? What should I do? Ajumma, where's my money? Answer me! Where's my money? I need my money even if he's dead. Bloody witch! Stop crying! It's not going to change anything. Go ahead and stab me, you punk. I can't get the money he owed me anyway. I might as well earn some money for my games. Come on, do it punk! I dare you. Hyeongnim. Hell! Is he out of his mind? How could you do this to me? I want my money back. This isn't what we agreed! Neither of us will be welcomed at home even if we can walk away from this. There's no longer a reason for us to live. Let's end it together. Let's die together. - Jin Sang, come with me. - Are you crazy? Come with me. You crazy punk. Did Yong Man commit suicide or was he murdered? I don't know. Some say he jumped off the building by himself. Others say somebody pushed him. There goes my money either way. Come on, let's have a drink. Let me pour it for you, Sir. What sins have we committed? It's money that's evil, don't you think? Have a drink, kid. You shouldn't have stabbed your own belly. I'll do whatever it takes to repay my brother's debt. Please go back today and give me a few days. Excuse me. I'll go the washroom and bring you more drinks later. But...who's this dude anyway? He seems to be Yong Man's brother. Really? We might still be able to get our money back then. I don't think Yong Man has any siblings. - I think he was the only child. - Who on earth...is this fellow then? Who is he? I'll rather take the money than let it go to those thugs. Someone took the condolence money while they were asleep. Kim Yong Man's wife claims that he was murdered and wants us to reopen the investigation. She has reason to think so. A security guard from the building across the street... ...heard someone arguing and went out to take a look. - That's when he found the deceased's body. - There was someone on the rooftop. You've finally come home. Isn't this dude the guy you were after? I'm asking you for the last time. Was it you or Jin Sang? It was Jin Sang. Do you have an alibi? I was at my girlfriend's house. Check the CCTV footage of her condominium. It was your last job and you were supposed to go your separate ways after that. You were only their driver. Yong Man promised Jin Sang 45% of their earnings. But Yong Man lost all the money on horse Racing. So, Jin Sang was frantically looking for Yong Man to get back his share. And this is all that you know? - Yes. - Did you get your cut of the money? No, I didn't get a cent. What a liar. Keep this up and your fingers will suffer. Spread your fingers. - Did you get the money or not? - Wait...! I got the money. But only half of it. - It's getting faster. - What?! Please no...! Yes, yes, I got it...! Next question. Was Yong Man's death really suicide? I don't know. I'm not asking for your opinion. Just tell me the truth. Was Jin Sang on the rooftop with Yong Man? I really have no idea! Sorry for asking you questions that you don't have answers to. Shall we do it with my eyes closed? Oh my...! Why are you keeping your eyes closed? Okay...you win! I'll tell you what I know. He hasn't been answering my calls. I think he might changed his number. Really? Ah, darn you! Return to your seat! Hey, Lee Jin Ho, come out. Hey, Lee Ho Won. Lee Ho Won! You little rascal. Where is he? Where the heck did this rascal go? Don't you know where he is? I'm done. It's wrong, you rascal! What? You want to quit school? Lee Jin Ho, Ho Won is following your lead and has been playing truant! A kid like you won't ever make it on TV. Get it? Now go, you little rascal. Did you fail your audition again? It's none of your business. Fine. They could mock at you all they want. Just continue to pursue your dreams. They don't know how good you can be. You heard about the dude who fell off the roof? Rumour has it that he didn't jump, he was pushed by someone. - How did you know? - My hyung said so. He also said that dude had a reputation in Cheongdo. He belonged to a notorious fraud syndicate in Gyeongsang-do. Have you heard Kim Lee Gong gang? Kim Lee Gong? I've never heard of it. The dude who died, Kim Yong Man Ajussi? He had two sworn brothers who wrote their pledge to each other in blood. What was his name again? Lee...Jin Sang. Lee Jin Sang. I think he's called Lee Jin Sang. The other sworn brother was often possessed by the dead when he was little. But since he didn't have the ability to be a shaman, he went to Seoul to be an actor only to end up joining the gang. The name, Kim Lee Gong gang was derived from their surnames. The used to be thugs in our town when they were young. Oh yes, you know Park's Rice Cake Shop? The one owned by the crazy granny. She had a son. Do you know how he died? I heard someone smashed his head with a brick. Are you tired of living? Keep it down! Where did you hear it from? My hyung told me so. So who killed the son? My parents refused to tell me anything... ... except his head was brutally smashed in. Shut up, you punks! What? Get off me, you moron! Hello. Are you seeing someone? Who's that fellow hanging around you? Are you tailing me now, Dad? I'm on duty. If you're so free, catch those swindlers and get our money back. I'm sick of living like this. Give me some time. I'll get him. When you get him, make sure to tell me. I'm going to wreck his family. A taste of the hell he put our family through. - Did you make sure the boys aren't sniffling around Han Ju? - Of course. Are you sniffling around her? Of course not. I'm her guidance angel. I wouldn't do that. Has this man come to look for Jin Ho? Not that I know of. But who is he? Just call me if you see this fellow appearing around Jin Ho. Yes, Father. Stop calling me "Father”. Yes, Father-in-law! Hyeongnim, we've been here for more than half a day. Isn't it enough? Futhermore, you shouldn't be using the station's resources for personal reasons. This is work. Lee Jin Sang's dongsaeng goes to this school. Oh really? Why are you following me? Do you have a crush on me too? I live in that house over there. If you have a crush on me, you can just say so. You're just like Min Ah from Class 3. There are a bunch of girls like you... Are they dating? Han Ju isn't that easy. He's picking up girls just because he can sing. If he can become a singer... ...so do I. Me too, I can be one too. I can dance as well. Show me then. Show me how you dance, you little rascal! Why should I? That's enough. You had better watch your mouths. Yes, Sir. But who are you anyway? Me? Lee Jin Ho's hyung. I really want to sing on stage, Jin Sang. You want to be a singer? Yes, help me become one. Are you crazy? How am I supposed to do that? Do you think I'm God? Do you think I can grant you all your wishes? And don't call me by my name. Call me "Hiya". (Gyeongsang dialect for Hyung) Get it? Okay, Hiya! That's why I'm asking you to let me transfer to a school in Seoul. If not, I'm dropping out. Stop this nonsenses. Where's your dad? I don't know. - Dad hasn't been coming home much. - Why not? How the heck would I know? Maybe he's cheating on you. What a thing to say! Mom, Hye Jin Noona has moved to Yangpyeong. Yangpyeong? Yangpyeong... So she has moved in with her in-laws? Yes, last week. Why? Their landlord doubled their rent. How could there be such unscrupulous people? - Mom... - Yes? As I was saying, could you rent a studio in Seoul for me? I can't afford it. You worked your fingers to the bone and you can't even afford a studio for me? Get a new job. It's the only thing I can do for a living. Darn. So you're saying I have to stay in this craphole forever? Jin Ho, what's gotten into you today? Jin Ho! Jin Ho! Ajussi, you're always get rowdy when you're drunk. Sleep in other's people house. Do you have dementia or something? Go to the hospital! You're really driving me nuts. To black out when you get drunk... ...it's kind of sickness! Is that guy crazy or something?! Turn it up. Attention, please. As you know ... ...one of our members got into an accident and we need a replacement. I know that everyone's nervous. Just show us what you've prepared. I'm the best. I can do it. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm Lee Jin Ho. You're standing a bit too close. Could you back up? - So... - Could you sing for us? What should I sing? Didn't you come prepared? I did. In fact, I've prepared three songs. A dance number, a ballad... ...and a pop song. - Which would you prefer? - Do a rap for me. You look like you'll be good at it. I've prepared a free rap song. ♪ Yo, Turn it up, my name is Jin Ho ♪ ♪ I'm going to make the judges present today give me the green light. ♪ ♪ The rest of the kids will also give me the green light. ♪ ♪ Playing with the beat, I'm the hip-hop man. ♪ ♪ Forget about the fellows who look down on me like my teacher, Mr. Park. ♪ ♪ Today's going to be another all-nighter. Yes, it is. ♪ ♪ Honestly, there are tons of people who are better than me. ♪ ♪ But I won't be intimidated. Starting from now, on this stage. ♪ ♪ ...the people over there shall be my audience. ♪ Stop. Tell me. Do you dance? Sure, I do. Shall I dance for you? Not like just now. Can you do something different? Hip-hop, maybe? Sure. I'll give it a go. - Do you know what your problem is? - Excuse me? First off, you have to change you dialect accent. Yes, Sir. Don't be late. See you in two weeks at 4pm. Excuse me? Aren't you coming for the second audition? The second audition? You've passed today. Prepared a rap song for the next round. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I can't thank you enough. Just get out of here. There's along queue waiting to get in. Thank you. Thank you. What do you think? If you like the apartment... ...you can have the keys immediately. Look, it's very new and clean. Look carefully. Who are you? Oh? My dongsaeng. Aren't you going to say hello to your hyung? Look at you. You're all grown up now. Let me cop a feel to see just how much you've grown. Hey, Lee Jin Ho! What the hell are they doing now? - Man, you're fast. - Go to hell. Don't come any closer! I said, don't come any closer! Finally talking to me after 9 years? Don't touch me, you scum! Jin Ho, you're going to beat me in our fights soon. Bloody hell! Hyung my foot! You're a filthy murderer! Lee Jim Ho. Jin Ho, hello. hello. Oh, you're here? Hello. Come in, Jin Ho. I see you're all grown up now. - Jin Ho, it's been a long time. - Hello. Is this too noisy tor you? We can't help it with so many of us around. Hello, Jin Ho! You're all grown up now. Welcome to our house. Jin Ho, come and have some breakfast. Perfect timing. I'll be joining a culinary competition soon. You can try my cooking for me. Somehow, no one else wants to. Oppa, do you really not know why? You've been cooking nothing but chicken for every single meal for 3 months now. Even dogs won't be able to take it. - Get lost if you won't, you witch! - That's enough! Did you forget Jin Ho is here? Watch your language. Come join me for breakfast. Mom, what shall we do for Si Hyeon's birthday? Shall I make a reservation at a restaurant in Gangnam like before? Hyung, can't we just celebrate at home? We just held a party for Won Gyun's birthday. He's right. It's too much for our relatives to give presents again. Hye Jin, my dear. Will your parents be here this time? I haven't call them yet. I'm sure they'll be here. My dear, is your dongsaeng going to be staying here every weekend? I think so. He has a lot of auditions lined up. Eonni, did he failed his last audition again? Aigoo, just how many auditions have he gone for? Darn, I should chosen to be a singer. You won't make it. Not with the face of yours. What's wrong with my looks? Look, my jawline will look just fabulous on screen! Not everyone can be a singer. If you failed once, you'll never succeed. Aigoo, he should know his limits. Aigoo, Mom! Did I say anything wrong? He's Hye Jin's dongsaeng. You should encourage him to give it up and focus on his studies. Am I wrong? Could you keep it down? He'll hear you. Oh, it's some good footage you have here. - By the way, Father. - Yes? I think you need to watch out for Han Ju. That rascal, Lee Jin Ho seems to be drooling over her. He follows her around like a dog in heat. Come here. Mind your language when you talk about my daughter. Ah, this is driving me crazy. Listen, shouldn't we be signing the contract? Noona. Is that you, Jin Sang? - Oh, sorry. - Where are you? Idiot. Jin Sang. Where are you now? Jin Sang? Hey, Sir. Are you going to make a payment or not? What are you doing? Say something! Hey. Apartment 202 is unlocked. But it seems to be vacant. What? What was that about Apartment 202? - Lee Jin Sang! - Hyungnim! Jin Sang. You look well. You must be living a good life. Good for you. Eat and enjoy life while you can. Don't let me catch you! Not unless you want to die in my hands. But I've been curious about one thing. Were you responsible for Yong Man's death too? Do you want dinner? Han Ju, do you have a crush on Lee Jin Ho? Did you put a tail on me? How do you know about Jin Ho? Lee Jin Ho, give him up. This is the man who swindled all our money. He's Lee Jin Ho's hyung. You're a filthy murderer. I said don't come any closer! Jin Sang, when are you going to clean up your act? Noona and Mom have just one small wish. All we want is for everyone to have dinner together. Why is that so difficult for us? Is it too salty? No one makes chicken soup like my noona does. This is the one dish I've been dying for. I just can't get enough of it. You shouldn't have brought us so many gifts. I made this. - I'm home. - Is my dear Jin Ho home? Get out of here right now! Why are you here? - I want to be with you. - Cut the crap... ...and get out now! Aren't you going to school anymore? It's none of your business. Jin Ho. I can afford a small studio in Seoul. What makes you think I'll stay with you? Forget it then. Wake up! Wake up or you'll be late. - What? - If you want to stay here, it's 300 dollar a month. For Jin Ho as well. Make sure you pass me 600 dollar by the end of the month. If you're plotting another scam... ...me and Mom won't see you anymore. Do you know the Chinese Restaurant at the intersection? This is the key for their motorbike. You'll work as their delivery man from 9-4 o'clock. You know the Nene Chicken across the street? You'll be doing delivery for them from 4-2 in the morning. Don't get me wrong. I'm not pressing you for living expenses. I just don't want my in-laws to think poorly of you and your past. I hope you're not in some kind of trouble again. No, I'm not.

Why do you ask? Nothing. Just let me know if you need my help. By the way, my cousin just opened a recording studio. I see. Let's hang out when we're free. Grab dinner or something. Okay. Lee Jin Ho...you have a hyung, don't you? Hyung? No, I don't. No? I guess the other kids got it wrong then. Ah, do you hang out at Gangnam? I'm at Gangnam now. Never mind. I'm just saying I'm in the area. I talk to you again then. Han Ju. Yes? Can I ask you a favour? Your daughter will stand a better chance of marrying into high society if she's singer. For just 400,000 dollar, I'll groom her... ...to be Korea's next top singer. Even so, wouldn't it be better for her to become a doctor instead of a singer? We're a family of doctors. That's not what Heaven has in store for her. If you force her to become a doctor, she's doomed to die a spinster. - Really? - You bet. This is...our road manager. - Is he? - Let's take a look at this here. Article 2, paragraph 3. Lyrics writing, composing... ...recitals, novels and... writers. Ajumma, the moment you sign this, you'll be signing away a building. Mrs.Hwang. Mrs.Hwang. Mrs.Hwang. Mrs.Hwang! What was that for? Why did you ruin my con? Why are you doing this? Aigoo, darn. Weren't you the one who ran away, wanting to sever ties? Hyungnim, can you help Jin Ho find an agency? Your dongsaeng? He's still between auditions? Let's see what I can do then. I guess 350,000 dollar would do. I'll still have to get him ready... ...but I'm sure I can work something out. What's the matter? Is it too expensive? What about 290,000 dollar? Hyungnim, I'm starting to get forgetful recently. What's the bad habit that you have? I need to refresh my memory on that. Whether it's my bad habit or yours... ...they're all but useless trash which can't be reused. It's been a long time since we last met. I really didn't want to bring this up but... ...regarding Yong Man Hyung's death, were you behind it? Where are you going Lee Jin Sang? Lee Jin Sang, where are you going? I have a part-time job.

Two weeks then. It should give you enough time to raise the money. Alright. I'll contact you when I'm ready. Hey, give Jin Ho a ride. If he's late, he might fail the audition. He can go by himself. Rude little brat. Hey, your phone... Thank you. Hello? No, I haven't found him yet. But Dad, is Lee Jin Sang really Lee Jin Ho's biological hyung? They don't look alike at all. You aspire to be a singer. Yet this is how you take care of your voice? - Get out. - I'm sorry, sir. That's enough, get out. I'm sorry, sir. Please let me try again. Yes, Oh PD. Sorry, I'm in the middle of auditions. Jin Ho. Are you kidding me? There are people offering me 1.5 million dollars! I trusted Ho Chang and promised him that I'd help you. That's why I waited for you. Who are you? Give the boy another chance. - Let the kid have his audition. - Mr.Park? - What? - Mr.Park? Hello? It's not what I meant, Oh PD. Once they're on TV, we'll have the money. - So... - Hey. So, like I said... Oh PD... No, I'm not that kind of guy. Hey. Yes, I won't forget what you've done for us. - But as I was saying... - Hey. Will you just get the hell away from me? What? Did you just tell me to go to hell? Hello, Oh PD-nim? It's not like that. No, no. It's just a misunderstanding. Yes, I'm in the middle of an audition... - ...and this crazy guy keeps pestering me... - Hey! Oh, good grief! Hey, punk! Do you have any idea what you just did? Do you know what you've just done? I'll pay you back for your phone. You'll pay me back? Please give my dongsaeng one more chance. This is driving me nuts! Hell. How are you going to compensate me for what I've just lost? What you did just cost me a show which is worth millions! And you want to compensate me for a crummy phone? Who the hell are you? Answer me! Who the hell are you? How dare you mess up my life like this? You bloody hell! Grab him! Hurry! Aigoo, what's going on, Gt Nam? Are you crazy or something? What the hell are you doing? Oh, my boy. Hye Jin! - Aigoo... - Mom... Mom... Hye Jin, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to help your husband to his room? Hey, didn't you hear me? What's wrong with you? Oh, good grief... What's with all the noise? What now? Hyung, are you drunk again? - How dare you raised your voice at me? - So what if I do? You useless piece of crap! Aren't you ever going to get a job? Are you going to idle your whole life away? You useless brat! - What's your problem? - Get out! - Eonni! Hurry up and take my Oppa back to his room. - Hey! How dare you raise your voice at your sister-in-law! Oppa, can you just sleep it off when you're drunk? - He's always like this. - Hey, hey, hey. How dare you disrespect me in front of my wife and her dongsaeng? You're dead meat. Why? Aigoo. Hey Gi Nam, How can you hit your dongsaeng? How could you say such things to her? - Mom, you too. You should leave with them. - What? Hell, I want everyone out of this house! Aigoo, is my wife your slave? Do you think she's your friggin' servant? Who do you think you are? How dare you get drunk and take it out on the family like some thug! - This wretched woman! - Mom! What did you tell Gt Nam? What did you say to my son to make him want to kick me out? Did you tell him to do this? Did you talk him into kicking me out? Huh? Aigoo, My son... Hye Jin, your baby's crying. Where do you think you're going? Get your filthy hands off me. You... What did you just say to your husband? His filthy hands? Filthy? What's so filthy about his hands? Make yourself clear! How dare you say his hands are filthy! Come on, say it! He neglects his own wife... ...and fingers other women with his hands. If his hands aren't filthy, what is? Are you cheating on your wife? - Hey, you! Are you out of your mind? How dare you! - Mom! Mom, calm down! Are you having an affair at work like your dad? Are you? Why, you pathetic little turd! - Mom, calm down. - Who's that slut? I'll kill you and then myself! Come with me! Come on! Darn. Aigoo, what should I do? Jin Ho. Jin Ho. Jin Ho. What did you just do? Can you still be a singer... ...with your ears like that? How about...getting one more surgery? I don't need one. Mind your own business. "I don't need one. Mind your own business.” Sheesh. Noona, don't hate brother-in-law too much. In spite of what he did... ...I know he loves you so much. He just made a mistake, it happens. He's stressed at home and at work as well. Things must have been hard for him. If you were him... ...you might have cheated ages ago. Are you still smoking? Be disciplined and just tough it out. You're good at that. Toughing things out. Thank you. For what? The last 3 years... ...have been a living hell for me. I should have left much earlier. You aren't being honest with yourself. You're obviously worried about your husband and kids.You can't even sleep. Jin Sang, on behalf of the family... ...I want to tell you that we're sorry. Thank you for everything...and we love you. What's gotten into you all of a sudden? What's this about? What are you sorry for? Look at how handsome you are. I didn't realise until I took a good look at you. Come on. Don't go all mushy on me. What are you sorry for? Huh? Don't do this. Didn't you hear me? Well then. Get your boys ready. I'll take a good look at them next week. Once this plan starts, everything will fall into place by itself. Everything is going to work out great. It's a small matter. Sheesh, you should done this earlier. Get up, hurry up! Try this on. What are you doing now? Just go and try this on. You're driving your husband to other women if you don't take care of yourself. Boss! Did you use this building as collateral to get a loan of half a million? - Don't tell me you used that money... - Turn a blind eye to this. We've done everything we could over these past 6 years. It's been so long. That still doesn't justify that! Ho Chang! This is our last chance. If Road King doesn't make it big... ...I don't know what I might do to myself. Hyung. We've auditioned more than 1,200 kids. How is it possible that there's nobody suitable? Boss... ...I do have one person in mind. Who? What do you think? Cool, huh? Make sure everything is in place. Get everything right. - Look at how I do it. - Okay. Wow, Hyung that's really awesome. That's right. You've to do it with a yank. Try it. Turn. Look how I do it. 1, 2, 3. Yes, everybody looks good. But Jin Ho still looks like a country boy. 1, 2, 3, hello! We are... R-O-A-D-K Roadking! What's up? What do you mean, where? I'm at home, of course. Is this your home? Dad? 1, 2, 3. Hello, we are... R-O-A-D-K. Roadking. - Lee Jin Ho. - Dad, let's talk outside. Lee Jin Ho, where's your hyung? I don't have hyung. Don't give me that crap! You'd better tell me the truth while I'm talking to you nicely. Where's your hyung? Listen carefully. If I can't catch your hyung, I'm coming after you instead. Are you a singer now? Do you want to appear on the 9 o'clock news? Dad. I can't help you but I can destroy you. What's this all about? I'm inverstigating a homicide. I received an info that my suspect's dongsaeng is here. The same goes for you guys. I don't care who you are. As long as you're with Lee Jin Ho, you can kiss your career goodbye. What are you guys doing?? Aren't you going to get ready? Don't you know you have a meeting about the programme this afternoon? Hey, Lee Jin Ho. Lee Jin Ho, where are you going? Han Ju, don't tell me you're... Did you have to do that? His hyung is the crook, Why do you have to punish Jin Ho? Ham Ju. - Dad... - Choi Han Ju, not another word from you. If I ever see you around him again... ...I'll make sure he'll never become a singer. Move your butts! Jin Ho. Please...just get lost! What are you talking about? Leave us alone! Darn you! What's going on? Please leave us alone. What? Oh Jin Guk PD is a goner in this industry. So I'm the new PD of "We Are Singers”. I see. Nice to meet you. I heard from Jin Guk that... ...a new group called Roadking or something will debut on our show. Are you guys Roadking? 1, 2, 3. Hello, we are... R-0-A-D-K, Roadking. You didn't give Jin Guk any cent, right? Everyone talked about it. Heard that Jin Guk has been arrested. All those who bribed him will be in a big trouble. You're not one of them, right? Well, I... You're got to be kidding me! I gave you the money. You said you used any mean to bring out the boys. If the PD can't be caught, we'll be doomed. What will happen to us then? Tell me, where the hell are you? We won't go down like this. We have to catch him. Where are you? - What's the matter? - Let's meet. You just told me to leave you alone. Why should we meet? Tell me. - Give me Lee Jin Ho's curent location. - He's near Hongik University. - So this is Oh Jin Guk? - Yup. Wait for me to leave first before you go out. All right? Lee Jin Sang. Lee Jin Sang! Stop there, you little rat! Darn, let me go! Lee Jin Sang! Lee Jin Ho, let go! Go. Hurry up! Go! Lee Jin Sang! Come here, you little rat! Hold it right there, you little rat! Stop there. Stop there, you punk! You filthy punk! Can this get any worse? With you half dead? You should have just died so we can at least claim for insurance. Why don't you say anything? It's not as if your mouth is hurt. Say something! We can't even afford life insurance. You couldn't care less about what happens to Han Ju and me, do you? We can't live with this insecurity. You startled me. Hyungnim. What's this? Who's this sneaky scum? Oh, isn't he a famous TV producer? Is this for your dongsaeng? I thought you said you quit? Aigoo,brotherly love. How noble! I wish my mom would give me a hyung like you. Oh wait, I'd need a father for that to happen. So what's your plan to trap this fellow? Let's make a movie. A simple short film.. He's on the brink of being fired. I'm sure he'll take the bait. He should be prisoned for ten years... ...so that he learn to appreciate a victim's pain. That's right. We know it well ourselves. Let's cast our actors. Is that all you have? Women will be the downfall of horny punks. And money is... ...the downfall of greedy men.. You know what? Most of our VIPs here work in the entertainment industry. That's why I'm a regular here. You know Tap Entertainment, right? - It was in a merger with a Japanese company recently. - Sure. It's the 2nd biggest agency after SN Entertainment. I heard that Tap Entertainment will go public next month. - I'm Oh Jin Guk. - I like both. All the better! He took our bait! What you see here now is our contract with Producer Oh Jin Guk. He'll sit here. These are all the TV shows... ...that Oh Jin Guk PD-nim has produced... All seats have been filled... except for one. We'll need someone like Mrs Park who will sign a contract... ...without any questions. - 10 million dollars! Who wants to have a piece of this pie? Mrs Park will turn 45 degrees to the right. Okay. Mrs Hwang.. Hello there, Oh PD-nim. - Yes. - Oh my! It's such an honour to meet you in person. - Yes. - The reason why I'm here is to meet Oh PD-nim. - I'm in hurry. - This is my daughter. Hello. - Lower it down. A little more. - Yes, yes. And this is... This is nothing much. Money? He doesn't believe in banks. He keeps all his money at home. But... ...he always leaves home empty-handed. Hello. Thank you for all your hard work. I'd like to make a police report. Hello? How are things going? - Are you having proper meals? - Have you caught that brat? Soon. We're almost there. What about the money? Can you get my boss's money back? Well, you can catch a crook... ...but there's no guarantee... ...you can ever recover the money. Was that what you did? You got busted for your scams... ...and didn't give back the money? Thank you. For catching that brat for me. But so what if you managed to catch him? He's just trash anyway. Don't skip meals. Hyung... ...will call you again. Hey, you know me, don't you? Yes. - What's going on? Let's talk slowly over tea, sir. - Mr. Oh Jin Guk... ...you're now under arrest for the embezzlement of venture capital. Where did Chang Bong go? Oh PD-nim will be spending the next ten years in jail. - When did I do that? - I've arranged for someone to accuse him of molesting a minor. She majored in acting at university. Her acting... ...Can move anyone to tears. He made me take off my clothes... Who the hell are you? I really didn't do it! I'm a Christian! Wait, detective. Hey, girl! Thank you, Hyungnim. But... Contrary to what I thought, we didn't find much cash. I wonder if he'd spent all his money. What's the passcode to the briefcase? How would I know? Hyungnim. - What? - Eat well... ...and lead a good life. Why can't I get my reimbursements? Was I out having fun? This is all spent just for catching that brat. I told you this case is already end, right? What about the cost that already spent? You brat! - Hello? - Detective Choi. When did you discharge from the hospital? Han ju. I'll be waiting for you in front of the studio until you come. Please read my message. Call me. Let me meet your hyung. Lee Jin Sang. You're now under arrest for the murder of Kim Yong Man. Do you have any proof? Don't worry. I can make something out of nothing. Let see. Dad. Where are you? Our in-laws will be here any minute. Come home now. - He said he'd be home soon. - That's great. Hye Jin... - It's been a while. - Hello, mother. Are we late? No, we're still preparing dinner. Aigoo, in-laws. Aigoo, welcome. Welcome! I thought you'd be too busy to come. - It's nothing. - Hello. Let have a seat. Aigoo, why bother to bring the gift. Let have a seat. Your dongsaengs didn't come yet? They're on their way. I see. Why didn't you answer my call? There's no signal at the practice room. Jin Ho. Lee Jin Ho, how are you? Dad. Why are you so thin? Aigoo, oh my. Why this so thin? It must be so hard to be a singer? Mom. Mom. Yes, why? I fell. Always fell. But... ...I always try to stand up again. But... This time... ...I really can't afford to stand up again. It's okay. It's okay, my boy. You are? Hello. I'm Jin Ho's classmate, Choi Han Ju. I see. Come in. Thank you. Don't worry. You'll get at least a three-year sentence. With a murder charge, it'd be at least ten years. - Yes. - Hyungnim. It's been confirmed. I've checked all the CCTV footage. Kim Yong Nam's death is a suicide. Lee Jin Sang was standing metres away from him when he jumped. He has nothing to do with the case. Hyungnim. Do we share the same parents? Don't call me that. Could you do me a favour, Hyungnim? I told you to stop calling me that, you brat! Do you have a dongaeng? - Please help yourself. - What a feast! Come, sit here. Are you Jin Ho's friend? You're so pretty. Jin Ho's mom is much more beautiful than me. - Do you think so? - Yes. You have a radiant glow. Hello there, everyone. - What's with the sour faces? Did anyone die? - You made it. Yeah. Hell, how many years has it been... ...since we gathered like this? Mind you language in front of our in-laws. Yes, Sir. So what have you been up to? I told you. I got a job in a small company. What company is it? Somewhere far from here. And where's that? Hey, why did you need to know so much? You little brat. You're still full of lies. Are you still scamming innocent folks? I've told you I'm not. Excuse me, Boss. Boss. Dad. "Dad"? He looks a lot like my dad. Hello, Ajussi. Ah, yes. I get that a lot. You look like somebody's daughter. Do you have a father? Please come in. Ah, this is my surbodinate that is still learning. He's a really sweet guy. Hello, I'm a Sweet guy, Choi Yong Pil. Hello. - Let have a seat. - All right. Come sit here. Let me pour a drink for Mr Choi. Oh, thank you. - For me too. - Of course. We are on our way... ...to a business trip in China. But he insists on dropping by to give a gift. He loves his family very much and there's nothing else he's as proud of. All he could talk about was his family. He loves his family very much. Hey. That Mr. Sweet Guy over there... he's a crook too, isn't he? A leopard just can't change its spots? Dad. Now tell me, you pathetic lowlife. When are you going to change? Dad. You can't treat Jin Sang like that. what? Dad. Come with me. We need to talk. - Let me go. - Come with me. Now! Father. what? You have no right... ...to criticise... ...or nag at Jin Sang. - No right at all. - Why? Have I wronged him? Yes, you sure did! You can never repay him... ...for what he did for you 12 years ago. Repay him? What do I owe him? I don't owe him anything. Are you serious? Don't you remember? I'm talking about Park Ajussi. Mr. Park? Park Ajussi from the rice cake shop! Why it becomes like this? Why are you doing this? Mom ... Jin Ho, and now you. Doesn't anyone remember what really happened? How Park Ajussi died. We were all accomplices in the murder. We let Jin Sang shoulder all the blame. Our family. Back then, we all... We all knew what really happened. We knew but no one... ...ever asked Jin Sang if he was okay with shouldering the blame. This is all your fault, Dad. You're the one who did it. What the hell are you talking about? So... You're the last person who has the right to find fault with him. He has lived with this blame all his life. Now he has finally found his way back to us. But if you keep picking on his wrong doings... ...we may never... ...get to see him again. I'll be back soon. Stay here, everyone. Don't be a party pooper. No matter... ...how hard you try to push me away, I'm still your hyung. You horrible brat. Yes, sure. Thank you, Hyungnim. Jin Sang. Jin Sang. Jin Sang. Jin Sang. Jin Sang. Jin Sang. Dad. You can't treat Jin Sang like that. On behalf of the family... I want to tell you that we're sorry. Thank you for everything and we love you. Hyungnim. Yes. I love you, Hyungnim. Hey, Lee Jin Sang. Lee Jin Sang. Lee Jin Sang. - Thank you for all your hard work. - Food delivery. Who ordered takeout? Very well then. We'll have dinner and finish the packing. Teran Road, Gangnam District, Seoul. Could you make my dongsaeng, Jin Ho, the leader of the team? - Hey, leader! - Yes, Boss. The way I see it... Your hyung is a godsend to us. If only... ...he could have gotten us a better car. Hyung, but we still have a problem. Are we really going to go ahead with just the four of them? Chan Wook quit yesterday. He said he was joining YD Entertainment instead. Do you know of any good dancers? This. This is for ddeokbokki. Are we good? And give this to your mom. Your father gave this to me. His last will. - What's this? - Father's last will. Are you nuts? What's the point of living? - Let's die together. - Let me go! Don't live your life like me. - Hey, Lee Ho Won. - Yes. Lee Jin Ho, thanks buddy. Where are you? Why haven't you called me back? Where the hell are you? Be ready. Jin Ho. If you want me to call you 'hyung' you'll have to give me a huge lollipop. Do you think I'm God? Do you think I can grant you all your wishes? Hyung. The pants too. Is it time? Here he comes. There, it's their turn! - Oh my God! Here they are! - Wow, they look awesome!
