Man, those were the times. You know what I find most amazing about how we got together in college? How many of us ended up married? Mmm, I like that. Happily ever after, huh? Yeah, who came up with that crazy line? Such a gentleman, huh? Oh no, no, no, gentleman? No, no, you killed him off a long time ago. Okay, all right you two, so... So, Tia, what about you? You know, we really used to look up to you in college. Really? Yeah. Mmm hmm. Now, why would you guys look up to me? Guess because you're so beautiful and you always seem so self-assured. Well. I'm a model. For real? Yes. I knew it. Baby, I was right. Yes, you were. I could not imagine walking down a runway. I mean, I wasn't a supermodel or anything, let's get that straight, but I did pretty well, you know, although things are starting to dry up a little bit lately. You know, after 30 girl, it kinda go downhill from there. But you're beautiful. I mean, look at you, you don't have a wrinkle in sight. That's 'cause of Botox, little nip tuck in it, keep it right. Well, we get back to that. Right now, let's go to the door and greet everyone, okay? All right, let's do it. Okay, yoo hoo. Come on, you drunk? Not yet. But I will be. Oh my gosh. Hey. Hey.

My lovely wife, Jill, and I been talking about gettin' us together for 10 years, and I think 10 years after graduation is the perfect time. Oh, absolutely. Here, here. To Tom and Jill. Tom and Jill. Yes, yes. I wanna know what everybody's been doin' over the last 10 years. I don't think we have enough night for 10 years of stories. How 'bout we start with a? All right, well let's start with the famous one of the group. Uh, I don't know, I mean. You guys know I play baseball. I heard Texas is trying to trade you from St. Louis. Yeah man, I mean, you heard right. Okay. But I got too much goin' on in St. Louis. I can't leave just yet. Ah, so you sayin' that you have a lot of balls to juggle, huh? Well, Tia. My lovely wife is in the restroom right now. She actually has a better story than I do. She's a Harvard graduate medical doctor. Ooh. Wow. No way. So, what about you, Stu? Started a hedge fund, you know. Took about 10 years but now worth about 70, 75 million dollars. Wow. Now, you see why he doesn't divorce me, huh? So, what about you two? Well, the last six years we invested in a family style restaurant. Oh. Mmm, so, how's it going now? How did it go? Yeah. Called the place Dancy's. Right now we got about five, five, five. You know what, man? I'm happy for you guys. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Didn't both of you major in education? I don't think teachers get paid even close to what they're worth. But I gotta tell ya, this place is nice. Thank you, uh. I'm really happy for you, too. Yeah. So, Ron, what's goin' on with you? Oh, you want me to follow the successful entrepreneurs and the multi-millionaires? No pressure. Come on, you're a musician. I'm sure you have a lot of interesting stories of you on the road, am I right? Yeah, man, you gotta have something interesting. I know you. Well, I recorded on a Prince album, went on tour opening for The Stones last year. You see? This guy's got the coolest life at the table. I would die to do what you do. Livin' the dream, man. Livin' the dream. What's up with the lemonade, Ron? You pregnant? Just bustin' your balls, come on. I've been sober for five years. Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, Ron. The guy's who's always passed out, be butt drunk, naked in the streets. Yeah. You haven't drank in five years? Yeah, college was big blackout and I started to suffer from CRS. CRS? CRS, what's that? Can't remember shit. You weren't that bad. Oh, I was. I was bad. You remember that with the baseball team? The tequila? Chlorophyll? Ah, man. Yeah, big black out in the college years. Okay, stop, stop, stop. Tell me you remember the Bobby Zwick? Uh, like I said man, big black out. Was I involved? Were you involved? We all were involved. It was crazy, man, you don't remember that? Nothin'? You remember Bobby, right? You know, the nerdy, weird guy. Bobby had made the fatal mistake of telling us that he has never been seen naked in front of a woman. That is crazy. And this was your friend? His boy, all day every day. What about the giant bottle of 151 that you brought? You got him hammered. Oh, that's why I don't remember, man. It was a bottle of 151. And Mr. I-Don't-Remember, while he was passed out, you stripped him down butt naked. You. Yeah, so we brought the girls in, put 'em in a circle, and... That's right and I had that huge bucket of ice water and I threw it in his face. Cold bitch. Yeah, and the cold woke him up and he was flopping around on the bed and then he realized all the girls were in the room with him. Quite right. He realized he was naked, he stood up and hit the floor, like bam! That's right. Oh my God, Bobby? Bobby, what are you doing here? Bobby. Eh, man, I didn't know you were comin'. You never confirmed. Good to see you, bro. I'm here. Oh, what a pleasant surprise. Hey, man. And I suppose you heard all of us reminiscin' just now, huh? I did. You know, we are really sorry for what we did. Sorry, sorry. Didn't sound like it. We are, we really are. Uh, it's all good, guys. We were teenagers and sometimes we do stupid things. Come on in, grab a seat. Make yourself comfortable. Can I get you a drink, Bobby? Yeah, if you have whiskey, I'll take it straight. Right, on its way. So, I don't really remember seein' you much after that prank. Well, you didn't see me because I dropped out. Really? No. Well, I did not realize that. Sorry to hear that. No, it's all right. If it weren't for that, I would have never enlisted. Enlisted? What branch? Army. Six years served. Done a tour in Iraq and an extended deployment through Afghanistan. Wow, that's good Bobby, congratulations. Good for you. Did you have to kill anybody? Well, that's not really something you talk about at a party, is it? Let's just say I was an electrical engineer in advanced weapon system. That's right, that's right. See, I knew was gonna be good at computers. It's because of you, Bobby Z. that I passed my computer science courses. I remember doing a lot of your papers, too. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember those days that a 12-pack of cheap beer would go a long way. Thanks, buddy. So, Bobby, do you have a lady? Uh. 'Scuse me, but, can you direct me to the bathroom? Ah, yes, right around the corner straight to the back. I think I've gotta um, I need to check my insulin. It's the room with the toilet in it. Why would you invite Bobby? What we talkin' 'bout, right? Bobby. Tom, why did you invite him? All right, all right, guys. Just relax. Now Bobby, he was part of our group, okay? Give him a chance. Tom, it's just gonna make for a very uncomfortable evening. So, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to tell him to go home? Yeah. This is stupid. I know. It is really stupid. No, this text message I got. What? Volatile nanobots have been placed in every bottle of liquor in the house. If you try to leave, toxins will enter your bloodstream and you will die instantly. What the hell? Let me see that. Nanobots, I don't, I don't understand. Okay, nanobots is just a miniature machines leading against cancer. That's just it. Did everybody get the same text I got? What is this, a joke? I don't think it's funny. Now, why would any of us send this? Not why, it's who. Who sent the text, huh? Well, maybe it was you, Tom. It wasn't me, Mo. I wasn't on my phone. It was Stu. He was on his tablet all day. You right, lookin' at my stocks, so watch your mouth, boy. So has Bobby. He hasn't even gone, where is Bobby? Bobby. Hey, hey, hey. Let's go find him. Yeah, let's go. Help you? No, , that's your boy. This is stupid. Shouldn't have brought him here in the first place. Damn, Ron. You know, two months is a long time. I've been busy. You been busy? Now, what's more important than taking care of my needs, rock star? Huh? Bobby, you in there? Comin' in. Not in here. Where'd he go? He's not here. Bobby. What's up, guys? Naw, this ain't no what's up guys. Why you send that text to everybody, man, huh? I didn't send any text. Bullshit. Man, we not in school now so stop playin' games, man. What games? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down, come on, guys. Please. All right. I'll take care of this. Bobby, did you send a text to all of us? I don't know of any text. Here, you can look at my phone. You could have deleted it. Let me see that. Deleted what? What were you doing upstairs? The bathroom is right here. Yeah. I don't know, I needed to have a moment of alone time. This ain't your house. You don't go up and down people's houses. What's wrong with you, huh? I didn't mean to, I just, I just needed some time alone while I took my insulin. Then what's this, hmm? Um. What's this? That's my insulin alarm. Oh, thought you took your insulin already. Huh? I took it just a little early. Yeah, sure you took it early. How can you take your insulin if your insulin is right here? Hmm. Explain that. Take it now. I don't need to. Okay, well let me help you out. You a diabetic, right? You diabetic. Your alarm went off, didn't it? you need this. That's it. Take it. Please. Take it. Take it, Bobby. Not playin' with you, Bobby. Please. Okay. He's fine, right? No. Do something. What's happening? He's dying. We have to call an ambulance. You wanna see 'em? Okay. Ooh. Oliver. No tuna for you. Get away from that tuna. I can't believe this is happening. I feel so bad for Mo. We should go get him. No. Let him have his time. Is anyone gettin' any bars? I'm gettin' nothin'. I'm gonna go outside. You saw what happened to Linda. But maybe the back door is safe. No, I'm not letting you do that. You got a message. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this text just came through. Who's it from? Unknown. It says two of 10 down, seven to go. Not a bad start. Then it says that Bobby's death was a nice surprise but let's talk about the rest of the night. It says number one, your phones will only work when I want them to. Number two, I will detonate all of the nanobots if you scream for the neighbors or you leave. And number three, all the nanobots will explode at midnight, so enjoy your final hours. What time is it? Oh my God. We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die! Baby. No, no, we're gonna die. We're not gonna die. please, it's gonna be okay. I'm here with you. I'm here, okay? No, it's not gonna be all right. Which one of y'all in on this? Now, one of y'all, don't look at me like that, one of y'all is doing this. So how 'bout this. Everybody put they phones right here. Let's see everybody sent messages. Let's see all your sent texts right now. Why don't we start with you, Stu? What? Why are you the only one gettin' the texts? I know you're not tryin' to question me. Damn right I am. Really? You were on your tablet earlier when you got the first text. Right, makin' money. It's what I do, that's right. You were on your cell when you got this text. So? And it was you that forced Bobby to overdose. Why you wanna bring that up, huh? You know that was an accident, right? So why you wanna bring that, no, no, no, I'm sayin' why you gonna bring it up, though? Huh? Let me ask you this, since you said you so smart, since you know everything, tell me this: how can I text myself? It was a from me to em... Wait, wait, wait a minute, Stu. What? Maybe you don't wanna be blamed for everything that's been goin' on all day, that's why. Guys. Wait, no, no, no, hold on Ron, no, no. You on his side now? I'm not on anybody's side. Yeah, well I was thinkin'... I'm on my side. Listen, listen, listen. All we have to do is find out who killed 'em and then we kill him. Or her. Nah, nah, nah, he lookin' at me. Man, that's right. You a killer? Look, I have to save us, that's right. Mmm. You guys, hey, did you hear that? He gonna save us. He gonna save all us, right? Right? You gonna save us? Come on, then, let's go. Save you, kill me baby. Yeah, what you gonna do? Guys, stop! Stop it, wait! Look, this not gonna... Show us all your phone if it's not you. All right. Clear your name. Got something for you. Here. Now, what's that say right there? What's that say right there? Let me hear it all out. It's from a blocked number, guys. Exactly. He's clear. Exactly. All right guys, let's just all put our phones like, in a bag and just talk about this. Hey... Shut the fuck up! Oh, I aint' puttin' up nothin'. Gimme my phone. All right, whatever. I get my phone. Can I get my phone? What does it say? Can I get my phone? What, what, what? Jill, what's wrong? Jill, can I have... Nancy! Jill? No. What does it say, Jill? What's wrong? Jill, what does it say? Man, can I get the phone? Oh my God. Somebody, somebody help me. Tom, Tia, help! Help me! Hey, Mo. Look, I'm, really sorry about your loss. Why don't you come in the living room with the rest of us? It can't be good for you to sit out here by yourself all night. I can't, I can't. Mo. She's gone, man. Nancy's dead, too. We're gonna need your help. Any one of us could be next. Any one of us. You ever see a dead body before? No. May not look like it, but, I grew up in some bad streets. After a while, the typical person becomes desensitized when it comes to death. Yeah? Mmm hmm. Not you? Me? It turns me on. Mmm hmm. All right everybody. It's nine o'clock and we have until midnight to figure out what the hell is going on. I don't know what the point is. We could drop dead at any time. Hey, yo P, forget about what happened earlier, man, our little beef, man, 'cause I know you mournin' right now, but we can't be sittin' around here waitin' to die, man. You know what I mean? What's so great about living? What are you talking about? We all sat around, tellin' our amazing success stories, right? About how much money we've made, how many people we've helped, right? But I can smell bullshit from a mile away, and it starts with Stu and I. Hell are you talking about? What Stu failed to mention is that the 70 million dollars he claims to be worth was squandered into nothing. You see, this is why I don't take you no damn where. You know what I should do? How's... You gonna do what, Stu? Gonna kill me? It seems as though I'll be dead soon anyway, right? Yeah, yeah you should. 'Cause all the money you spent was on your little Botox, your little nip... Oh, not even close, not even close. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I shoulda never have married your little ratchet, triflin' ass. And I shoulda never married an impotent idiot, but you know, I been gettin' mine, though. Yeah, I know. Six months worth of side dishes will fill you up when the main course doesn't arrive. Holy shit. It's Ron. What? You don't even drink. So? So. No, no, no, no, no, now you right. You don't have no nanobots in your body, do you? Guys... No, no, there ain't no guys because what that means is, you're not gonna die in three hours. You're not gonna die, man, like everybody else, right? Yeah. What's that to do with any... We're crazy to snap your neck right now, man. No. Hold on, guys, we need to think before we do something like that, all right? I'm not behind this. No, no one is killing anybody, okay? Why not? I'll do it. There you go, Mo. Because of you my wife is dead. Mo, Mo I had nothin' to do with your wife. Slow down, Mo. We know who it is. Let's just end this now. Mo, if you kill me, we all die. Oh, wait, wait, wait, what do you mean, we kill you we all die? Guys, I'm the only one that can walk outta here and get us help. Then why first place, huh? You stayed to watch us die? You know what, forget about that, P. Mo, snap his neck right now. He killed your wife. No, no, no. No, no! I'ma make him drink. You guys put him down. Put him down, put him down. No, no, no! Look, bro. Yeah, baby. Yeah, here we go, here we go. Look at that, look at that, look at that, no, no, no. Now we're even. Now we're even, yeah. Let's see if you die at midnight now. Now we're even. Yeah, let's give him another shot. Let's give him another shot. Huh, huh? Yeah. What are we gonna do? Don't worry about it, Jill. Everything is gonna be all right, all right? We're gonna figure this one out, just relax. We should have never planned this night. What do you mean we should never have planned this night? These are our best friends from college. What are you talking about? Our best friends? Tom, you invited a killer into our home. A killer? So, you think I'm behind this, huh? You think I had something to do with this, Jill? I don't have anything to do with this, all right? What, you don't believe me? Hey. Sorry to hear about Linda. She's good woman. Thanks. You too, I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. Nancy was a good woman, too. Yeah. We always got along real well in college. College. Like it was yesterday. You know, we went on our first date to Max's Bar. Every time I stepped to the bathroom, dudes all over my baby. You know I had to check 'em, Mo. Went back, started a brawl. Fistfightin'. But you know what? Nancy, right there, had my back, crackin' fools with bottles. Crazy. I never heard that story. Probably 'cause we spent the night in jail. But you know what? It was Linda that bailed us out, and she didn't even ask for bail money for an entire year. Yeah, she was a good woman. Okay, well... You know, she was goin' through some rough times though, lately. Oh, yeah? Yeah, she had, she had been losing some patients in the E.R. You know, hadn't been sleeping very much. You know, blaming herself and depressed. She actually tried to kill herself. Aw man, that's terrible. You don't think she went outside because Bobby died? I don't think so, I mean, but I don't know. Man, it's messed up for everybody. I got diagnosed with cancer a year ago. Last six months of chemo. Doctor finally just told me I was healthy. Best day of my life. Nancy and I, we danced 'til the night was dead. Next day, I went to work, found out that she made some bad business moves. Didn't listen to customers. Next thing you know, all five restaurants, gone. That's horrible. Yeah. Life is what I got now. It's what we make of it. Try to get outta here alive, you know, man. Five years of sobriety, just uh... My sponsor's gonna kill me. Question for you brother. Why did you not offer to go out and help, hmm? I couldn't. You couldn't? What do you mean? Well, I got a text message that you all didn't get. Oh you did? Is there anything you should be tellin' us? Huh? What? What the hell is your problem? Yeah, what's goin' on, man? If I told you guys, we would all be dead. Come on, with that bullshit, man. What's goin' on, man? Did it say that you couldn't leave? Oh, fuckin' A. Queen of the sluts fuckin' figured it out. Whoever is doin' this wanted us to make you drink. I don't even fuckin' care anymore. Ron. Okay, cheers. What if we ignore 'em? I don't think that's a good idea. If all of our phones are in the bag, that means none of us in this room are behind this, right? Unless, one of us has an extra phone. Yeah, so where y'all comin' from then? Listen guys, let's see what this text says and deal with that later. Well, what if we just ignore... That's not a good idea. We need to see what they say. Hold on dude, let me do it. No, no, no. I'll take care of this. so, we do this all one at a time, so, who's phone is this? Right here. So everybody can see what's going on. Right? Hurry up. Watch your mouth. I'll tell you what's up. This you? Okay, of course it's you. So, the text says, we're all doing great, but now let's step it up. They say the greatest delicacy on Earth is the taste of human flesh. What? What, flesh? There's never a better time than now to find out. We have exactly 15 minutes from now. Whoever eats a chunk has a chance to survive the night if you don't die. I hope you like Chinese. What the hell does that mean? All right, everybody look at your phones right now. You all had the same message I just got? Yes, the taste of human flesh? Yeah. Do we have to eat someone? Oh, hell no, no! No. Not just someone. Linda. No! I thought that bitch was Korean. No! Yeah, but she's some type of Asian. Kung pow. Oh, no, no, no, no. We are not eating Linda. But it's Linda. Well, not without a good pair of chopsticks. You really find this funny? This shit ain't that funny. It's some sick shit, man. What's so funny, Ron, huh? Hungry. You're not eating my wife. Guys, guys. Do we wanna die right now? Wait, wait, wait. So, you're cool with this? You have no problem eatin' this woman? If it gives us a chance to survive, then we have to do what it takes. No! What did I marry? Jeez. We have 13 minutes. So, I guess we can cut up some pieces and cook it. Perry, you have a restaurant, so you should know how to properly do this. Yeah, I never cooked a human being. Wolfgang Puck. I don't wanna die, man. Let's just do this. Okay, so. You go prepare the pan. I'll go get some ice. Okay? Perry, I'll grab the knife, all right? You're comin' with me. Man, this some crazy shit, Tom. Yeah, it is. Now she the ringleader. What part should we take? I guess we should just cut into the leg. Which part? The thigh. We need to get the muscle tissue. All right, here. I can't do this. Perry, I don't know anything about this. All right, gosh. Hurry up, we only have nine minutes. - Just do it. - Okay, okay, okay. All right, all right, I've never done this shit before, man. Oh, no, no. No, come on, man. All right, let's do this quick. We only have six minutes. Can I get some seasoning and some olive oil? I do not know how this is gonna taste. Go, go, go, we only have four minutes. Oh my God. This is, this cold. Come on, Perry, you're doing good. You're doing good, Perry. Now, I don't know how this is gonna come out. Might be like a filet, medium rare. We have two minutes, guys. We only gotta eat a piece of it, right? All right, I'll start. Oh, it's not that bad. What's the seasoning, man? Salt. Oh, oh my God. We gotta get this to Mo. He's not gonna eat it. I'll go force him to eat it. We have, like, 90 seconds. Let's go. Let's go. Mo, we have no time, you have to eat this. No. Mo, you're gonna die. Can't force me to. Open your mouth, Mo. No! There you go, there you go. Swallow that, swallow that. Chew it. Eat it. There you go. Oh my God. Come on. Oh! Yo, still on the real. Tell a brother somethin', man, 'cause I know if you wanted to kill her, you could do it any time. But you have something to do with this, right? If I did, think I'd tell you? You know, Stu, it might benefit you to have me on your side. Yeah, how you figure that? I'm good. Hey Perry, come on, man. Come, come, come on. Come on, let's go. I don't know why I quit drinking. Booze is definitely a good time. It's the only thing that's got me through my marriage for the past nine years. Marriage. gotten married. Have a wife, couple kids. Settle down. Ron, okay. You're boring the shit outta me right now. Okay. It's very possible we only have 90 minutes left on Earth. Very possible. So, I don't wanna spend it reminiscing about the past or whining about what we didn't do. I just wanna live and have sex. In 20 minutes, I'm going to the laundry room, and you're gonna meet me there. Got it? Yep. We're not gonna make it, we're not gonna make it. Listen baby, we're gonna be fine. Trust me, okay? No, we're not, we're not. Okay, okay, listen, listen. I been thinkin'. There has to be some type of clue in this house that can stop this. There's no plan this perfect, I know that. Okay, what do you mean? All right, what I mean is that there's a, there's no exterior power outside the house right? So, if there's some force field that's destroying our cell phone signals and connecting us to the nanobots, then there must be something connecting it inside the house that's pulling the power to make this happen. Yeah. Now, listen to this. Now, what I been doin' is I been secretly walking around the house searching for it and I haven't found anything, so what we need to do is, we need to keep searching until we find it, okay? I love you. I love you, too. Huh. Let's go. Did you all get this? Why don't you stop all this? Just tell us who you are so we don't have to go through all this. Man, what the hell you talkin' about? You probably in on this whole damn thing. Bringing these damn shots. Now, who made those in the first place? Fuck you, man. Oh, fuck me. Not in a million years would I have something to do with my wife's death. Yeah, what about losing those restaurants, huh? Insurance money? Okay, so how the fuck did you know about that shit? Mo told me, that's how I know. Okay. Okay. Look, she screwed up some things, and I had cancer, but I am not about this. If you have to choose, can we just get this over with already? So, four of these are heavily drugged with an unknown substance. One is only food coloring. The last is laced with a lethal dose of cyanide. Does anyone see any difference? Well, I don't see anything floating. I don't see any changes, either. Well, we have two minutes, so Perry, just start passin' 'em out already. Does anybody wanna choose their own? At this point, I don't care. Well, me, I guess I feel good about the yellow one. Are you sure, baby? Yeah. Red. Shit. Blue. Purple. Down the hatch. You're orange. Man, I'm not drinking that shit. He gets to choose. Hey, I don't care what he gets to do. I'm not drinkin' it. Why you not takin' it, Stu, huh? You know what's in it? Drink it. No. Are you in on it, too? No, he's in on it. That's why he's passin' the shit out. Hey, it's the one I chose. It's the one you chose for me, huh? Hey, I'm not drinkin' that shit. No, I'm not, hold, hold, hold. He the one passin' it out, man. We can handle this real quick, Stu. What are you gonna do with that, hmm? All right, get that outta my face. Want me to drink it? I'll drink it. Happy? To the answer. How does everyone feel? Fine so far. Not feelin' anything. Look, if this is how I'm gonna be spending my last moment, then, I need to go get some alone time. So, here's my phone, just in case you guys think I'm gonna run off and do something weird. I'll put it right here, okay? - All right. - Fine with me. Yell if you need anything Felitia. Yeah, bye Felitia. Get your ass off. Who in the fuck were these here in the first place? I said it had to be you. You was here by yourself. Stu. Stu nothing. Naw, I'm still standin'. Ron, you high, man. Oh, yes. I found you. You found me. Listen, I do have some bad news, though. I crossed this river to get here and the horse drowned, or the unicorn drowned, something drowned. We lost. Oh, no. Yeah, sorry. Oh, that's so sad. You know what, though? This washing machine is giving me life again. You taste like Stu. Guess what? What? You're everything I ever wanted. Fuck you. Take me. These pants gotta go. Okay, okay. They're too hot. The belt's in the way. Get the belt. Fire the belt, fire the, you're fired. Belt's coming off. Step into my office. Bad belt. Do you feel like you're high or do you feel like you're dyin'? Must have got that cyanide. Oh, shit. Let me go check on Jill. Take care of him. Get away from me! Get naked bitch! Demon be gone! Now do you believe me that I had nothing to do with this? Yeah, man. I'm sorry 'bout that. Look, man. There's something I think you need to see. Backstabbin' son of a bitch. Yeah, it stinks. Gonna do this shit here? You need to hail that. Dirty piece of shit. What the fuck? What the hell are you doing? Get the hell outta here! What the hell is your problem? Stop it! Get your fuckin' ass up! No, wait! Stop! Stop! You killed him, you piece of shit! Shut your fuckin' mouth, slut! You killed him, you piece of shit! You killed him! Ah! Sit the fuck down! I'm gonna fuckin' kill you now. You next, bitch. You killed him! Stupid piece of shit. You killed him. No, what are you doing? You're next. Gonna die together you fuckin' bitch. Bitch! Stu, let me outta here! Stu! Let me out! Let me out! Jill baby, it's okay. It's okay, baby. It's okay, baby, you been drugged, that's all. You just been drugged. Drugged? Tom. Jill. Hey, Stu. What have you been painting? Are you all right, honey? You okay, Jill? Yeah. I'm fine. I just wanna know what Stu's been painting. It's not even the color scheme of our house. Stu, what the hell is going on, here? What happened? Ron's dead, man. What? How? How's he dead? What happened? Who's Ron? Perry! Where the hell is he? Where is he? Oh, baby, they're playin' our song. Thank you, maestro. Oh, I didn't know we were having a dancing party. Excuse me. May I cut in? Nancy. Perry! Nancy's dead. She's dead. I'm sorry, Perry. I'm so sorry. Jill. Just let us die alone. You're still ready, Ron. You're still ready. Oh, your dick feels so big. 'Til death do us part, bitch. What the hell is wrong with you, man? You just killed your wife. I'm gonna kill you, too, Tommy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Just put the ax down, man. No, no, no. I'm tired of this shit, Tommy. Time for you... Stu, Stu, listen man. We been through this many of times. Put the ax down and let's just talk about this, all right? The way I see it, Tommy, the way I see it, only a few of us left, right? And Perry's been poisoned, so that leaves... Listen, listen, maybe that's it. Perry faked his death with the poison. Perry's dead. Dammit, Jill. Hey, nice try, Tommy. Oh my God, Felitia, oh my God! Felitia. Now I can kill both of you right now. No, no, no, no, no! So wait a minute, listen, man. If you kill us, man, then you gonna die anyway. How you figure that, Tommy? How you figure that, Tommy? Because! 'Cause I'm the only one that can stop this. What do you mean? What do you mean? What are you talking about, Tommy? This has been the best time of my life and I'm really enjoyin' it. I'll kill you right now. No, no, no, you see, Stu, I'm in control here, right here. I control it right here. So, you might as well just put that mother fuckin' ax down, and you got 19 minutes, hear me? 19 minutes. Now, you gotta find this device. It's somewhere in this house. I been controlling it through this damn phone, so look upstairs, downstairs, the basement, I don't give a fuck, but find it, and when you find it, destroy it and maybe you'll walk outta here. Go! You son of a bitch! You killed everybody! Whatever! What am I lookin' for, Tommy? It's a device. You'll know it when you see it. What kind of device? Look! What it look like, Tommy? 19 minutes, 18. What did you do? What does it do? Come here. Listen, we gotta keep playin' the game, all right? Let's keep searchin'. Let's go on for it. Tommy, eh, man. Where the hell is it, huh? Stu. Quit bullshittin'. You might be gettin' warmer. You gonna keep playin' games, huh? Hmm? Where is it? You might be gettin' colder. But it doesn't make a difference to me. Keep lookin'. Warmer or colder. There's nothin' in the hallway. Oh my God. Let's forget the basement. See, this is fucking bullshit, Tom. We done searched this whole damn house, man. What is in the first place, huh? I don't man, your guess is good as mine. I don't like guessin' about shit, Tom. What does it look like? I don't know. It's like a computer or controller or something that doesn't belong. It could be anywhere plugged up. Just keep looking. We got less than 10 minutes, guys. Yeah, okay, I'm gonna whoop your mother fuckin' ass, Tom. 10 minutes. Hurry up. This is it. It's okay, now deactivate it, Tom. No, no, no, no, no. That's not it. It's out of place. It's fuckin', Jill. Was this here before, earlier? That's our old computer monitor. It doesn't even work. No, no, no, it had images on it. I know this. What? Okay, you know what? It's not even plugged in. There's nothing... Because it's by Bluetooth. Bluetooth. And he showed me his fucking phone. You're wasting your time, here. You're wasting your time, Stu. Stu. Stop. You're wasting your time. How 'bout I waste my time whippin' your ass, Tom? Stay focused, Stu. I'm staying focused. Stay focused on the device. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop it! Stop it, stop! Stop it! All right. Get the fuck up and listen. I lied, man, I had nothing to do with this. You lied about what? I lied, sorry. Holy shit! Surprise, mother fuckers! What the fuck is going on here? Well, this has been quite an evening. Just about everything has gone according to plan, hasn't it, Stu? It has. Clearly, yes it has. You in on this? Huh? Yes, I am. You know, you almost had me going with this, 'cause you never know when Bobby might change his mind and do anything, you know, but yeah. One of the best days of my life. Why'd you do this to us? Why? Do I even need to explain that? The minute I walked in, you all made it perfectly clear why this had to be done. You were scum in college, and you are scum now. So, because you were bullied in college you had to kill everyone? You couldn't find another way? Technically, I only killed a few people tonight. Stu here, did a fabulous job with the others. Who would have thought of such a decisive turn of events between you and Felitia, huh? I daydreamed about that for so long. You know, who wants to deal with a messy divorce, takin' half my stuff, no. And much, much more fun to kill her like that instead of those old nanobots givin' it to her, you know? I wish I had been able to be up there to see that. You woulda loved it. You woulda love it. What's wrong with you? Wrong? What's wrong with me? I find that terribly condescending, considering the present company I'm with. You see, in the end, I'm still coming out the better person. I've never been cruel to people. I've never publicly humiliated someone so badly that they are scarred for life. That is what you did to me. With my professional skills, I could have publicly and privately destroyed you. All of this is nothing. Bobby, come on. We told you we're sorry. Look, we never knew we hurted you this bad. Look what you did to us, look. Oh, how could you do this? We're sorry. You're just crazy. You're crazy. Oh, I talked it out with my crazy self. We talked it out for many years, and if our crazy conversations culminated in a night of depravity like this one, it's not my fault. Fuck you, man. You're dead. Hey, I wouldn't murder me just yet, tiger. I will annihilate you and Jill in an instant. There's now more to do. You know, Bobby, I say we should just kill them right now and get on that plane. Wait. Stu, you are gravely mistaken if you think there is a we. The only we there ever was in this plan was when we used your money to fund all of this. Indeed, military grade nanobots, force fields and computers to control them come at quite a price on the black market. Not to mention, the bad experimental psychedelic calico weapons that Jill has been savoring this evening. Don't you love it, how it comes in waves. Oh, this is going to make it rather difficult for the next activities planned for the night. Whoa, we're done. Not doing anything else. Stu, I think you're forgetting who's in control, here. I'm the one with my finger on the button and you're the one with nanobots in the bloodstream. Oh, and I've been meaning to tell you, I was able to successfully transfer to my own bank account every last penny you own. You said I had the antidote. And what do you mean that you drained my account? Bobby, I will fuck you up. I have mind powers. Consequences of one too many unfortunate military experiments. Now, now, Stu, if you are finished with your interruptions, let's begin. Item number one, a chainsaw. Quite a powerful machine, especially when utilized on human flesh. Item number two, a cordless power drill. Although visually not as terrifying as the chainsaw, it's ease of use and effectiveness should not be understated. Item number three. A crowbar. Categorized as a simple machine, the crowbar is far more primitive than the chainsaw or the drill, yet has been time tested for thousands of years. Where the hell you goin' with all this, man? Getting to that. Each of you shall use one of these tools as a weapon against one another. Since I have been forced to hide down here during all of the upstairs fun, it's my turn to enjoy the front row seats. You have two minutes. One of you must die. Man, this is bullshit. We should just take him. Stu, quit your bitching. Clock starts now. Just kidding. Mind powers. I am truly sorry for your loss, Tom, but that was magnificent. 'Course I was hoping to find a way for you and Jill to survive the night. That would have been bittersweet, wouldn't it? But now it's just you. Eventually, the nanobots will dissolve and you'll be free to live out the rest of your life with the memory of this night. Kinda makes what you did to me pale in comparison, doesn't it? Although, not quite as subtle as I would have liked, this night may be my greatest achievement. Old friend, my time on this planet has come to an end. My teleporter awaits. It's been nice knowing you, Tom. Have a great life. Well, that was unexpected. If I can ask, sir, how was the reunion? Best night of my life. Where to?
