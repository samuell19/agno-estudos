They reopened the hunting season on stage coaches... pull up your pants you sloba and follow me. It's time to keep our regular appointment with darling Clementine. My milk improves enormously with Chaicosky's sex walzy music. With my crop of cream will be the cream of the crop as long as we don't have to put up up with any more of that dreadfull rock and roll, it just brings out the butter in me. This music puts me to sleep, gives me something with a hot rhythm, something with a afrocuban beat, something to make my troops... How uddly-cuddly!!! Ci, ci, ci, ci, ciici... Socrate don't scare the chicky and don't drink so much you're getting to be a regular brooze-hound. Here comes Clementine... it's that time a day. Milking time girls!

Go ahead, I'll stay here ask for her land and her hand, if she refuses scare her and I'll gallop to the rescue, she'll find me insistable... - You must be in love! Ich ich ich... - Aaaahh Shut up, do what I say, I'm the big boss. When I was only a calf, I saw a rodeo once and they had a marvelous way of catching a bull; twirled a rope and zum... he has the bull by the horns. You girls, if you ask me that's no way to pick a husband they say they not pick up bulls that way they throw them down. I wonder if Clementine can catch a man that way! But she's trying to scare the man away! No, just bad men, that's not a scare crow she is making... that's a scare bandit. Frankly I'm worried about Clementine if any of this group wants her land but claimes after hand. Well, he is ugly. But being a man makes...! Look girls! Here comes the assistants is... Don't just stand there Dolly, I'll be along, turn the allarm! Oh ooh oh... Are they coming to ask for my hand again? Hello darling Clementine, our boss who's hiding behind some rocks out there, said us to ask you for your hand and your lovely lace green patch of land... You know this property is all he can think of poor men he is going loco with desire for it, he is dying for it... He wants it so much that its killing him and everybody else... bang, bang... Kill your gruesome boys, gruesome... any too quick for me... Well, Slim the boss says to scare her if she refuses, so lets start the show. Ich ich ich How can I stop them, what'll I do? Hey, ol? Bessy... away... two... one... two... three! Ich ich ich Ehi, here, have a good cigar! Those noughty bandits now, what did I do with that gun, oh trey're making me so nervous now where's the powder? Come on, sister! Yaaaaa... Yaaaaa... Yaaaaa... Pull... pull, till it blows up. - Ich ich ich ich ich - Ah ah ah... I certainly hope this is the right way to load it... if it is I have to shoot that. Give that back to me, give it back so... I can shoot you... You bully... That's enough! Dear, gentle lady forgive these repulsive children, they're just loaded with hot spirits... ...get out of here! I'll take care of you later. I'm the only one strong enough to control them... but... deep down, they are really not so bad, they just need a kind hand and maybe you also need a kind hand? Or... you learn what could happen to you and house if you turn me down. See... made me your love will be a lot safer... I love you darling Clementine and I love your land, I have tremendous plans forthe future of this valley, tremendous spectacular plans, and ljust happen to have one with me. Look at that! All of it will be ours. What do you think of me now? - May I speak frankly? - Oh, I'm waiting anxiously for your answer. You make me sick. Hey Slim, the boss got a little dizzy, take a look! - It must be love!!! - Maybe it was a lady's boot. - Yeah, looks like he got a kick out of it. - Right... He, funny, his face is stamped with soulful love. Ich ich ich... It's made a deep impression on him. Ich ich ich... Her attitude has left it's mark in our minds and on my face... deeply... ...people of the valley today Clementine turned me down, forthe last time she has refused me her sweet and love and her valuable land. He did it! Hip, hip, urrah, hip, hip the boss... no one... a piece of land but my patience has run out finally. I don't like the way the boss shout, we're in for more trouble than usual. People you know my reputation as a great lover of land among otherthings. Cattivissimo... You are all of us! Uuuuus!! You set them out forthe boss and you... through tick and ticker. All right, let me ask you something. I want to know how deep is your loyalty. Are you willing to be hit in the face with a lady's boot? Nooooo! Before you answer let me put it to you differently, are you willing to let your boss be hit in his face with a lady's boot? Eh? Now tell me, do you want me to be hit in the face with a lady's boot? - Nooooo! - I didn't think you would and so now we'll handle that little lady the way we've handled the whole valley. We change the last cinema in the stand in the way of progress that your Clementine does not outlook... up to know but from tonight on she's got to find out and is up to you to get up for find out to guess this new entire valley orto get that little lady. For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, for... he's a jolly good fellow and so said all of us, and so said all of us. - The music of nature. - The rain is very good forthe fields. Some of you have a cigar? I start liking cigars. Dolly, please... Yaaa. Oh, you are nothing but a worm, a snake, coyote cat, get out of here, get out, don't let me see you ever again! Lh ih ih... Bye. I wonder why the light didn't roasted you! La la la m m m mmm la la la Oh stranger, this place is busy as an hotel, sing the alarm... This time is loaded... go away or I shoot, one... two... two and a half... two and three quarter... two and seven eight... is he dead already? Darling, put on an appropriate record, there is someone dead there. Who is he? I've never seen him before, he looks dead but, if he is dead why does he feel smoking and if he is not dead maybe he's alive, that means he's not dead yet... - Ehi stranger are you dead? - Alive girl... only tired! Why are you lying there? - I fell off my horse! - So I noticed! Ljust rode 1381 miles... I've got to get out, I can't stay here. You can stay here, what's more you need is rest and vitamins, meantime tell me who you are, where you come from, where're you going and why. Do you really want to know all about me? Well, don't think that I'm interested in you. Noooo... then why you're asking all those questions, if you are not interested in me. Anyway, my name is Johnny. Oh... the more I look at him, the more I want to look at him. - Ssssssstt - The more I want to look at him... he's beautiful! - It was an accident. - I'm sorry, I shoot without thinking. Mhhh... what a coincidence right now I could use a fast gun like you. No...! Anything but that don't ask me to shoot that man I couldn't do it ever again. - Why not Johnny? - Complexxes! My past is chasing me! Johnny why did you leave your guns at home? Don't you feel unprotected without them? Well to tell the truth, I do feel a little naked. I'm going to do a little shopping, but please Johnny try not to get into any trouble without your gun is going to be very hard. Welcome stranger... oh, oh, ah, ah, glad to see felling for us, down. But watch yourself down, if we're around you could get afraid. Lh ih ih Yehhhh! Ehi you... you down the bar with the hat, ye I'm talking to you, you're new round these parts... am I right, tell me you fellow, where are you from, uhm what do you know, which way you end up, we're interested, and now tell me something else you wouldn't by any chance be a dirty government agent would you? You know something Slim? He must be a mushroom that pops out last night. A fresh little mushroom from... nowhere, ah, ah, ah, ah, I don't like strongsider strangers!!!!!!! - They're fighting, eh? - I fell so. - Dirty fighting. - It's their work. Business looks good. - Is he a stranger? Never saw him before! I wonder how he likes the town. It's mighty quiet... they must have done someone in. Sorrow, over six feet, long box, probably broke sell an oak, best brest, first class a packing freightining planting charges to grease digger relatives. Coward scandalous, shame on you picking on a handsome honoured man. Oh... you'll pay forthat. Come on Johnny, lets go get your gun and show those two horribles drunkers they can't do this to you... and I'm shocked at you Esmeralda... giving such company. But, I didn't pay the bill for the juice I didn't drink. You should have paid those two bills instead! When you're angry like that you seem to me even more beautiful. Ah ah ah. Lh ih ih... Look at that, look what the stranger got. Gold, shiny gold, it's a fantastic nugget, you two found! You mean, that I found, I won't credible find again. That idiot of Slim has nothing to do with it. Aaahhh! Do you think I'm nothing but an idiot? I'll review a part, piece my face, then I'll put upir fath hang up in the sun and swink and fly in your... bunk and nobody calls me an idiot. Shut up idiots, put your brains to work if either of you have got any! Ah... I want him to tell us the way to find the shiny gold nugget... there must be many more where he found this gorges little beauty. I always had a weakness for shiny gold nuggets. I love them even more than I love land and land is gold... Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah... Oh! What a lovely silence. Silence is more than anything else a sysmatic phenomenon. Ehi Johnny, what does it mean? I don't know. Very often I don't have the slighest idea what I'm talking about. - I'm very curious about you Johnny! - You think it! I got that message when you started cross-examined me, so... face my slightest phisical imperfection... I've got... as you can see. Tell me. Why are you complexed? Did you kill someone? - Euh... I shoot. - Did you really? Crazy, you don't look like a killer. Who did you shoot? Oh, well, my best friend. He was going to kill me. Did you ever consider going to an analyst? Sure I did, it was my analist that I shoot. The moment I killed him I destroyed all my feelings of violence... from then on I never shot another man, - I only shoot at tin cans. - Only at cans? Cans. Bang, bang, you see, full sight. It's too bad Johnny, because you shoot so well. I never miss. Look at this shot, bang, bang and watch this one, bang, bang, see? Aahhh. With a little practice any one can learn to shoot without a gun. You're strange, you're even a little luny. You think so? You are the first woman who understands me. That's why I feel at home. How long have you know your analyst before you did it Johnny? Five years it was and then I've shot him. Long time, what made you wait so long? What a domestic scene as he will whisper sweet nothing listen to your ears. Well Clementine? May ask one question? No, I've already told you... I rather die than marry you. So long, this question is for the brain thincancelor. Will you be so kind to honour us with your company, so we can have a little time to talk. Well! Time is wasted are you coming? Oh chiven! ...You know, your name sure fits, you are a gruesome! Ahh... Ah! Ah! Ah! I get to control myself... I want him to die. Grr grr grr. Lh ih ih. Ah ah ah. Patapim patapam... Ah ah ah. Johnny! There you are... knocking is confortable... ah ah ah. Ah!! Ah!! - And what if I don't talk? - You're dead meat. All right come on, hold the prey away, lets go! Well... we've particularly waited 7 days for you to answer, have you changed your mind and decided to talk? Where did you find this nugget... talk... Anyone who shoots to an unarmed isn't wortherto be talked to! I'm not interested in your opinions, I want you to tell me where you found this gold. Ehi boss, I've got a groovy idea... why don't you let this massacre to Government's agents? We've done such a good job we can get an incent credit for it. Ah ah ah. Your groovy idea is square, forget it... There are other way to kill him that are very interesting let me show you the way they work, - I guarantee he will be dead for good. - No, I'm trying to make to you coward talk and to do that he's got to be alive but I don't think we'll have to waste much more time on him, I'll turn the jof overthe real experts, there are some busy ants around here that can make a stone talk. All right girls, go to him have a good meal. Now listen to me horse face, it wan't do you any good to try to stop... those ants with your fancy cigar... they only get madder or angrier. Just tell me where you found that gold nugger and you can sleep in a better bed tonight. Look stop trying to make like a hero, you don't impress me at all. TALK!!! Frankly ljust feel very causy down here whenever I've gone to the beach I've enjoyed been embared to the sand. Ehi... look Slim the coward has some courage. Well, but it won't last... they ask already for another charge. Lh ih ih Come on, spit out the name of the mine, ah ah. You only have a few seconds left. - Now what they are going to do now... - Hush! Iook... EXHIBITZIONISTS... Did he escape? It's true... take a look. - There's no long gone. - He's gone. You let him slip, you... He's gone away... forthis... I should hang you forthe rest of your miserable life. Oh, I've got to know where to find that nugget I can't stand not knowing... he's got to be made to talk, rack your brains! What would we do now. I've just a groovy idea. Well, let's hear it! Why don't we go to town and ask the help of beautiful Esmeralda. Esmeralda, how come you thought of her? It's natural isn't it? I'm sure you know women have special ways for make a man to talk. Lh ih ih... Johnny, hallo handsome cowboy, yes... you come on Johnny I've something important to tell you, come on... - That was the ghost! He's still living! - But let's keep crackebly, our part of the job is for later. Ehmm, ehmm...
