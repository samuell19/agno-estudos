My name is Terry Jean Moore. I was born July 28, 1956, in youngstown, Ohio, the youngest of three. My mother worked at a factory, and my father worked at a steel mill. I was about 3 when they separated. Sometimes I was with my mom, sometimes with my dad. Back and forth all the time. It wasn't easy. Didn't have many friends when I was a kid. I stayed mostly to myself, and I listened to records, and I dreamed one day I'd be famous. It's the truth. In 1974, I graduated high school and moved with my grandparents to a trailer park in Orlando, Florida. I was 17. I got a job working at a potato chip factory and stayed there about a year. I was making good money. I wasn't saving any. I moved back up north for a while, and that's when I met my cousin Jesse. We was talking one night, and I told him I was going back down to Florida, and he should look me up if he came down. You know what my main problem was? I didn't know how to take care of myself. You know how you think your parents are always going to be there? Well, they're not. And then my grandparents moved away, and there was nobody taking care of Terry Jean Moore. So when my cousin Jesse showed up in Orlando, he suggested to go to New Orleans. He said there were jobs there. And I was alone. There was nothing for me in Florida. Nothing that meant anything. So this is my story. And it's true. Hey! Unh-unh, man! It's green. It's a green car. Sorry, sorry. Bad luck. Well, what are you waiting on? I'm waiting for something better. Trust me, huh? Hey, we got an easy one. No, wait a minute! They're old people! I'm not driving with old people! I'm not driving with old -- get off of me! Are you nuts? No! Say "I'm going to get in the next car." No old people, no green cars! I don't care if it's an old car or green people. You're going to get in the next car. No. No? You don't think so? [ Laughing ] No! Oh, yeah? I don't want to be here. Well, what are you going to do? I want to go home. Oh, to Ohio? They don't even remember your name. Are you coming or not? Okay. Hey...you remind me of my brother. Oh. I hated him. Man, I been hitching since Michigan. You know something? From the side of the road, america looks like shit. You from Michigan, too? Uh, she lives here. Going home then? This on the way to your house? Yeah. It's not too far. I got to let you off here. I live right around the corner. [ Horn honks ] I live right up the street. This is where I gotta let you out. No. Drive the car! Okay. Drive the car! Don't pull any funny stuff on me, okay? Okay. Nothing! Look, it's just the... It's just the car. That's all we need. All right. Don't mess around, 'cause I'll hurt you. I swear. You going to fool around with me? No. All right. All right. Take it! We need gas money. Here. Turn in here. Oh. Now, listen. This is what we're going to do. You get out of the car and come back here with me. And you go around and drive the car. What? I said for you-- it's a stick shift. I can't drive a stick shift car. What? I can't drive a stick shift. You can't...You can't drive the car? No I cant. Why didn't you tell me? Well, when was I supposed to? I was supposed to come to you and say, "let's not steal this car 'cause it's a stick shift"? You hold the gun and I'll drive. I ain't touching no gun. How can I hold the gun and drive? I don't care, 'cause I can't drive this car. I don't even have a license! Wait a minute! He's getting away! Oh, Jesus! He took the keys. [ Panting ] Time's up. I'm going. No. We got to wait longer. Quit tugging on my arm. Gotta wait. He could have called the cops. Well, I happen to be soaked. You're acting like you want to get caught. Give me that. Give me that thing. Look, Jesse. I'm soaked. I gotta get a coke. I gotta get a cigarette. Let's go! Jesse: Did you ever see a guy run so fast in your life? [ Laughing ] That guy was hauling ass. Let me see some I.D. On you kids. Come over to the car, would you? Come on. Got any I.D. On you, boy? Come on. Come on over. What do you want? Come on. Put your hands on the car. Hey, hold it! Hey, come on! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hands on the hood. Come on! Spread them, spread them. Spread them. [ Panting ] [ Siren wails ] Man: Freeze! [ Shutter clicks ] [ Shutter clicks ] Man: Look straight ahead at the camera. Just turn your head to the left look at that clock on the wall. [ Shutter clicks ] Okay, look straight ahead now. [ Shutter clicks ] That's good. Let's go now. Take off your panties. All the way down. That's it. You're going to have a body cavity search. Oh, that feels like a dream. Will you quit looking at me?! Go ahead, honey. Walk to 7w. It's okay. [ Woman yells ] Woman: Look at her! [ Indistinct conversation ] What difference does it make? Just play the damn game. Okay, I'll go! Oh, I got a good one. What difference does it make? It's your turn. Come on. Terry Moore? I'm Joe striker. Um, I'll call you when I need you. I'll be right outside. Thank you. I'm your attorney. Sit down? Okay, Terry Moore. In the good state of Florida, robbery with the use of force -- that's armed robbery. I never touched no gun. That doesn't matter that you never touched no gun, the kid you were with touched a gun. That makes you just as guilty as he is. I've never even had a traffic ticket before. I'll check that. Look, I don't tell no lies and I don't need a lawyer that doesn't believe me. You want another lawyer? No. All right. Sit down. Would you please sit down? [ Sighs ] Okay. Your friend chaney has turned state's evidence. He's a juvenile, and his public defender made a deal -- he's dumping on me? The driver of the car positively identified you. He even identified the make of the gun. I never touched no gun. Did he say I touched that gun? Armed robbery carries a life sentence in Florida. Terry, I'm trying to get you off with less than 25 years. All we got was $5. Man: Mr. Striker, will you and your client approach the bench, please? I understand your client desires to enter a plea of guilty. It's correct, your honor. Have there been plea negotiations? Yes, your honor. Miss Moore has agreed to plead guilty to simple robbery. Oh, without the firearm attachment? That's correct, your honor. I've explained to miss Moore the punishment for the offense. Now, miss Moore, do you believe yourself to be mentally alert and capable of exercising your best judgment? Yes. Now, has anyone threatened to harm you or hurt you or impose on you in any way, or deprive you of anything in order to make you plead guilty? No. Now, at this time, would you like to change your mind about pleading guilty to this charge? No. All right. Then the court is ready to impose sentence. Have you anything that you want to say on her behalf? Yes, I'd like to point out that miss Moore has never been in trouble before -- she's been in trouble, but never been caught. Your honor, you have her background report before you. There has been no prior -- Mr. Striker, it just is not relevant human nature to participate in armed robbery. One has usually led a life that has involved, in some respect, violations of the law. Your honor, it's a matter of record. Miss Moore, do you realize that the victim of your crime thought it necessary to run because he was convinced that you were going to kill him? The victim's testimony was that he was afraid of the boy who was wielding the gun. And that boy was placed on juvenile probation? Yes, your honor. Well...anything else, Mr. Striker? No, your honor. Miss Moore? Your honor... We really didn't want to hurt nobody. Your victim apparently thought otherwise. All right, I'm going to rule. On the defendant's plea of guilty to armed robbery, the -- unarmed robbery, your honor. All right. On the defendant's plea of guilty to unarmed robbery, the court adjudicates her guilty of that offense. The court is sentencing her to 15 years in the state prison, requiring that she serve 7 1/2 years of that term, and then be released and placed on probation for 7 1/2 years, subject to the following conditions. Hey. Hey! I said that's mine. Give it back! You want it? You want it? Here, here. Come on! Come on! Go ahead. You do it. It drives the guards crazy when they smell smoke. Do it! Do it! Do it, Terry. Do it! Come on, come on! Do it! Do it! Come on! Do it, girl! Watch it! Watch it! Hold it! You just hold it right there! [ Yelling ] Aaaahhhhh! I ain't going in there! I told you I didn't start that goddamn fire! Close 22! You better get out of here, boy! I didn't start that fucking fire! [ Crying ] You want a fire? Hey, you want a fire? You hear me out there? I'll show you one right now, huh? You hear me out there?! You want to see a fire?! This is going to be my fire, you got me? This is going to be my fire. Can you hear me out there? This is my fire. This one is for you down the hall, baby! Woman: Shut your hole, you cow! I'll show you a fire. I'll show you a real good fire. Oh, you want to see a fire? Hey! I got a fire going in here! Can you hear me?! I got a fire! I got a fire! This is my fire! Can you hear me?! This is my fucking fire! Open 22! [ Fire alarm rings ] Straitjacket! We need a straitjacket here! You get it out of your system? I said, did you get it out of your system? Yes. Can you sit up? Where's your family in all this? Ohio. Last I heard, the phone lines still got through to Ohio. It's my trouble. You get mad, honey, try something else. Pray. Anything to keep that temper of yours in check. They gave me 15 years. How am I going to do 15 years, Benson? I don't understand. There are girls here -- five counts of this, four counts of that, a year, maybe two. In other counties, even probation. They gave me 15 years. Fifteen years. Fifteen years. Fifteen years. Man: Therefore, the court, having no legal reason why it should not proceed to pronounce sentence, and acknowledging the defendant's plea of guilty to the charge of arson in the first degree, it is the sentence of the law in the judgement of this court that you be committed into the custody of the department of rehabilitation for imprisonment for a term of five years. Further, that your term to which you have just been sentenced shall begin upon the completion of the term which you are already serving. Miss Moore, it's not often that the court has a young lady like you before it on a charge such as this. It's just a shame that you've let your life go down the drain like you have. Woman: Good morning, ladies. I'm Helen sturgis, superintendent of broward correctional institution. Each of you has received a copy of bci's rules and regulations. I suggest you read these and thoroughly familiarize yourselves with them. Please save any questions you may have until the end of this orientation. How long? Twenty years. My god. You're going to spend half of your life in here. Man: I'm captain Mark Ellis, chief correctional officer here at broward. I want to talk about escape. Some of you may be thinking, "no gun towers, no barbed wire, couple of fences, not too high -- not so tough." I'm going to set you straight if you're thinking that. If you climb the inside fence, you are considered an escapee. If you're near the top of the outside fence, the guards will fire one warning shot. If you reach the top of the fence, their orders are shoot to kill. Now, let's return to our... Sturgis: One -- inmates shall not be disrespectful -- oral, written, or signified -- to any staff member. Two -- any physical contact between inmates is prohibited. Three -- all instructions are to be carried out. Okay, let's go. Next. Step down. Come on. Come on. [ Buzzing ] [ Buzzing ] Ellis: On page 14, we see penalties for infractions. That's punishment if you disobey or violate the regulations. For example, count procedure violations -- missing count. We call it recall here, and it happens four times a day. If you miss it -- 30 days solitary confinement. Sturgis: ...Or allowing an inmate to visit your room will be grounds for disciplinary action. Twenty-nine -- shouting or yelling to passersby or employees entering or departing the institution is prohibited. Thirty -- only one inmate at a time is permitted to occupy a single-person restroom.

I never had nothing that was mine. Except for my place in Orlando. See, before I come in here, I had this little place not much bigger than the room I got right now. But it was mine. And I could open and shut that door when I wanted to. Why did you let go of that? I don't know. I followed this dumb-ass kid right out of my door onto the road. It wasn't his fault, though.

Hi, miss latimer. I mean, suppose something goes wrong. Terry, there's nothing to it. Unh-unh. I've heard stories about it. Terry, I know. You had an abortion? It was just once. I mean, I just tried it once to see what all you broads saw in it, and I got nailed. Dropped my belt once, and I got nailed. Well, I was thinking maybe they don't have to find out about it. How you planning on hiding it? Jack's lawyer is going to get me out. Look, we were already talking about it. I'm just going to be here a couple of months. - I hope it works. - Well, it is.

Well, it really ain't none of your business. You're right, but i'm probably going to be standing next to you when the shit hits the fan, so do you mind telling me what you're planning to do about it? I got a lawyer. Who is it? I don't know his name. You figure a lawyer you never heard of who's never heard of you is gonna get you outta here 'cause you got a friend? He has so heard of me. Anyway, it's got nothing to do with this. Don't you think you better deal with this first? I am, and i'm making up my mind. Hey, you don't make up your mind around here. When they find out, they're gonna make you have an abortion. I'm going to be out of here before they find out. - Terry, that's nuts. - Anyway, they can't make me. I'm going to have this baby. Go ahead and have it. Go through the whole pregnancy. Have a baby. They'll take it away from you before you even set eyes on it. Please don't tell on me. Please. I won't. Hey, high and mighty. Don't think I don't know. I seen you wiggling your ass in front of Hansen at the education building today. Hey, Mara, you know, you're really mental, so just fuck off. You the one that's crazy. What do you think you're going to get out of him? You think he's going to help you bust out of here? You think he's going to take you in his arm and fly you over the fence? Sister, you just another piece of ass to him. Same like the others. I probably could have had him myself, except I ain't that curious about white meat. Especially no used white meat. He's sticking it into you, and then going home and sticking it into his old lady. Probably make some more babies. You wearing them big shirts already. You sure you ain't got nothing in there yet? Just shut up! [ Laughing ] You're married. Why didn't you tell me? How? How am I going to explain to you about a -- why didn't you tell me? Would it have made any difference? The baby -- you said you was glad about the baby. I was. I am. Everything I told you... I meant it. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. Oh, baby, it just got out of hand. And I don't know how to tell you what to do. I'm not asking you to tell me what to do. I'm just asking you -- are you married? And I was asking you -- would it have made any difference?

I told you that was going to happen. What are you going to do now? I don't know. Come on. Sit down. I think he was making up that stuff about the lawyer. Did you ask him that? No. [ Sighs ] But you thought he was making it up, didn't you? Why didn't you help me, j.J.? Why didn't you keep by me? Why didn't you make me find out? I guess I didn't want to know any more than you did. Oh, j.J., I don't know what to do. I'm so scared. I just figured if me and Jack was together, it would be okay. I can't be here for 12 years. I feel so stupid. Baby, it's all right. Mama is here. I'll take care of you. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. It's okay. Hey, Terry, here. Thanks. It's okay. Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Help me! Guard: Code three, kitchen! Code three, kitchen! Let's get them in the freezer! Aaahhhh! You didn't see it, j.J. You didn't hear it. It was horrible. Those women were screaming. They had to drag them in the freezer. You know what this place does? It takes women and turns them into animals. They're not doing it to me. Terry, cool it. Nobody is taking nothing from me. You're with me, or not. You've got to help me. I don't got to do anything. If you think you're having this baby -- I'm going to have this baby. And I'm going to keep this baby. Ain't nobody going to take this baby away from me. I'm asking you for the last time. Are you pregnant? No. Terry, I'm putting you in medical confinement. Woman: Let's go, Terry. Oh. [ Laughs ] You have a good time tonight, you rascal. Man: You bet I will. You got to know. They got her. Medical confinement. Hansen quit. Did you hear? So what? And I hear he's leaving Florida. Maybe he needed a vacation. You're really tough, aren't you? [ Sighs ] Terry, as a rule, I don't get personally involved, but you're going to need some help. Why don't you just sit down? Let's have a talk. He's gone. What do you want to protect him for? Okay. You think about it, though. Which one of US you think can wait the longest? Lock it up. Woman: Attention on the compound, attention in the dorms. Inmate Rosa haught, report to medic. [ Knock at door ] All right! Terry: I am writing to you in hopes of receiving some help. I have already written one letter, and have not received an answer, so I am sending this one registered mail. I feel I need some legal assistance. Although I am in prison, my problem is not of a criminal nature. I think I have a civil case. Jacki, I have one for you. Tony, will you give me a break? Don't I have enough to do? No, this one is for you. We have an inmate here at broward correctional institution. You know we can't handle criminal cases. Well, she says she's got a civil case. She doesn't know how to spell it, but she knows what it means. Well, for the purpose of today's discussion, let's just say that...You are pregnant, and the doctor verifies it. Terry, what do you suppose is going to happen to you? You tell me. Just...just agree to the pregnancy test and you'll be out of here. Isn't five weeks enough for you? Okay. Okay what? Okay, I'm five months pregnant, and I happen to know too much time has passed. You can't make me get an abortion. "I am five months pregnant. "The father of my child is a correctional officer. "I have not identified him to the officials. "At the present time, I am very --" I think it's concerned. "...that the department of corrections "will make me give up my child. "According to the Florida corrections code, "section 944.24, if any woman received by "or committed to said institution "shall give birth to a child "while an inmate of said institution, "such a child may be retained in the institution until it reaches the age of 18 months." I'm jacki Steinberg from legal aid. Let's do this sitting down. My friends in the library found this law. I wrote that letter myself. I know. I didn't think they gave you -- you didn't think my spelling was so hot. Well...you got me here. Yeah. Why? Because it matters to me what happens. You're a woman. You have rights. Private rights? Yes. Do you understand this statute? They don't. "If any woman shall give birth to a child "while an inmate, "such child may be retained in said institution until it reaches the age of 18 months." Do you understand? I can keep my baby. It's more complicated than that. It's up to US to prove that the may be -- "such child may be retained" -- is at your discretion. No may. Hey, look, I am going to keep this baby. Do it again, baby. Do it again. Oh. Baby. Precious butterfly wings. Do it again, baby. Well, first we let Terry deliver at a regular hospital here in lauderdale. A well-staffed hospital. Then the baby will be delivered to our county agency. Uh, Terry wants to keep the baby with her. Well, that's just impossible. Not according to Florida statutes. The state has no facilities for that sort of thing. I mean, hell, most inmates have abortions these days. The state pays for them, or the, uh -- well, the girls just do it themselves. Nevertheless, Terry is more than six months pregnant, and she is going to have this baby. And according to Florida statute 944.24, she can keep that child with her for 18 months. Ooh, well. See, I don't, uh... I don't care how you interpret that statute. As counsel for the department of corrections, no inmate is keeping a baby in any institution in the state of Florida. Thanks. [ Humming ] Man: Attention on the compound. Inmate 78, report to classification. I'm going to kill your baby. - Hi, Terry. - "Hi, Terry." You said you would be coming back soon. It's been two weeks! How am I supposed to know when you're going to come? Maybe you forgot. Maybe you're not on my side. I'm your lawyer. Lawyers is what got me in here. Armed robbery is what got you in here. Oh, now you think I belong here, is that it?! I didn't say that. Sit down...Shut up and sign these papers. What are they? Well, they say i'm your lawyer, if I still am. - Sign here? - Yeah. Both of them. Here? Got any kids? No. You know how you was saying that we're going to have to fight? Shit, I have been fighting my whole life. It's different now, 'cause it ain't just me. I mean, I got a responsibility. Hi. Oh, hi. I got permission to come in your room. - You're kidding me. - No. I'm scared. It will be all right. I ain't never been to court for me -- having somebody listen to me. Man: Are there any further witnesses? Steinberg: No, your honor. Then let me hear from the state. I call Helen sturgis. State your name please. - Helen Francis sturgis. - What is your occupation? Superintendent of the broward correctional institution. And do you know the plaintiff here? Yes, sir. Were you ever requested that the plaintiff be able to bring her baby back to the broward institution? Her attorney contacted me, and I said no, we did not have facilities to care for a baby at broward. Well, would you elaborate on that? Apart from being a superintendent, I'm also a mother and a grandmother. Your honor, I have to object. This is irrelevant to the testimony she's going to give. I will overrule your objection. Proceed, please. What I'm trying to say is that I have in mind not only the security of the institution, but also the interest of the unborn child. We have 24 inmates who are at broward because they have previous convictions of escape. I object again. Whether she thinks the institution is dangerous is irrelevant. I happen to think that it's quite relevant, so you may proceed. Objection overruled. Five of those inmates who have previous convictions of escape took hostages with them. That is one of my concerns. Am I going to order one of our armed guards to shoot at an inmate while she's holding a baby? Steinberg: This is purely speculative on her part. I will overrule your objection. Go ahead, please. Also, we have frequent fights and assaults, both armed and unarmed. Now, I'm not a psychiatrist, but I have been told by our psychiatrist -- objection. Hearsay. Objection is sustained. We have 22 inmates who are serving mandatory 25-year sentences for the most serious crimes, inmates who have charges of child abuse -- 10 of them, and at least 4 have resulted in the death of the child. Man: And do you have any knowledge concerning the, uh, emotional problems of the population? They're very hostile. They're very volatile. They can break into fights at any time. Man: And are all the inmates entitled to be throughout the area of the facility? Oh, yes. They are free until dark. With your knowledge of the institution's general population, do you feel you could protect this child? In all honesty, I don't see how I could. No further questions, your honor. If the court ordered you to guarantee the safety of the infant with its mother, what would you do? Well, I would... I would try to comply with the court's order. But I feel I could not do it. Steinberg: Is there not, in broward, an inmate who's kept in a special place? Say, a person waiting on death row? Yes. Did you not make special provisions for that person? If you call being locked up 24 hours a day -- Steinberg: If the court ordered the child to be kept with its mother according to the state statute, then you could make special arrangements. I believe we can try anything, but I cannot guarantee the life of the child. But you would try to make special arrangements. If the court orders me. Steinberg: Thank you. No further questions, your honor. I call captain Mark Ellis. Please send him in. Man: Captain Ellis, they're ready for you, sir. [ Door closes ] Judge: The witness has been sworn? Yes, he has. Would you state your name, please? Mark Ellis. And where are you employed? The broward correctional institution. And prior to this, what previous experience have you had? Twenty-five years in correction, the last eight years here in the Florida system. Sir, would you be able to protect her child? It's impossible. I don't see how we can do it. I have no other questions, your honor. If the court ordered you to protect this child, would you do everything in your power to protect it? Yes. Steinberg: Thank you. I have no further questions. Judge: Is that all? Any further witnesses? Man: No, no further witnesses, your honor. All right. In that case, I don't need final argument. I am ready. Except, would plaintiff or plaintiff's counsel wish to make any remarks or comments? Yeah, I'd like to say something. Please, go ahead. The first time I felt my baby move was in solitary, and I stayed in solitary so I could keep my baby. Now, I seen some of the things you been talking about. Bad things... But nobody has taken no time to talk about the good things, like how this baby has changed me. I got a responsibility now. For the first time in my life, I got a responsibility. You know, I used to think it was everybody else that was doing me wrong. It ain't so. It's all up to me. And I need to keep this baby. 'Cause I love this baby, and we belong together. The plaintiff comes here seeking equitable relief in justice. Our state legislature has passed a statute, and the law seems very clear. But we do have two unique problems here. One, the right of the mother to be with her child. And two, and much more important, the right of the child to be with its mother. No matter what my decision here today, it is up to the department of corrections to provide for the future welfare and safety of this child. And if it cannot be done in this particular facility, then it must be done in some other facility. I, therefore, find for the plaintiff, Terry Moore. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a jury waiting for me in open court. Terry, we won! I can keep the baby? Oh! Woman: Attention on the compound, attention in the dorms. At 12:30 A.M., Terry Moore gave birth to a baby girl weighing 7 pounds, 9 ounces. [ Chanting ] Terry! Terry! Terry! Terry! [ Cheering ] Terry: On August 21, 1979, me and my baby precious were paroled. I spent 741 days in prison, but the ones with my baby wasn't so bad. I'm serving my probation now back in Orlando, but it's different. I got something now -- something that matters, someone that I take care of. And you know what?
