♫ All to Jesus ♫ I surrender ♫ All to him I freely give ♫ I will ever ♫ Love and trust him ♫ In his presence daily live ♫ I surrender all ♫ I surrender all ♫ All to thee my blessed savior ♫ I surrender all - Satan wears lots of disguises, doesn't he? He wears disguises of friendship, of lustful thoughts, of drugs and alcohol. He disguises himself as things that make us feel good to make it easier for us to sin. Isn't that nice of him? He wants to make it easy for us. Today of all days we must work together to stay alert. We must become a neighborhood watch on the look out for Satan, and we must let Jesus Christ be our watch leader. For as Peter says, "Be sober, be vigilante, "for our adversary the devil "as a roaring lion walketh about "seeking whom he may devour", and whom does he want to devour? Our children. For Satan is a pedophile, brothers and sisters. Tonight he will be roaming free in our neighborhoods luring our children into the shadows with the promise of candy forcing his burning darkness upon them and desecrating their innocence from the inside out. We must pray for the children, and we must pray for each other for we are all God's children. God doesn't want us to hide behind masks and costumes. He wants us to find our own greater truths. That is what a revelation is. It is a revealing of his truth. I want you to grab the hand of the person sitting next to you. Feel that you are not alone. Let God touch you. Let him protect you. Let him reveal himself to you. Can you feel him? Let us all bow our heads. All of those amongst us who are so moved by the heavenly spirit raise up your hands and show the Lord that you are ready and willing to receive him. If you want to be protected by his light, guided by his power, saved with his redeeming blood in your veins, I invite you to come forward to kneel before the congregation and to accept Christ as your savior. (dog barking) You gonna eat that? Dude, I was kidding. No, you can have it I don't even want it. I just didn't wanna throw it away. - You know plain donuts really are the worst. It's like just bread. - Actually that was a powdered one, but I licked the entire thing first. - Oh, okay seriously. - No, no, stop, stop. - Do you give up? - Yes, yes. - Ascencion, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize you were still here. - (gasping) Help me. - Talk to me, Ascencion. What does the demon do to you? (woman gasping) What does the demon do to you? (woman gasping) I want you to see Jesus holding out his arms to you. I need you to go to him now. Alright I need you to go be with him. I need you to go be with him. Go be safe with Jesus, and leave the demon here with us. (woman screaming) I'm speaking to the demon now. (woman screaming) We call upon Jesus to banish the demons of violence and anger from this body. (woman mumbling) We lift this inferior curse. I will leave this body and return to the pit. Say it. (woman screaming) (tense music) I will leave this body and return to the pit say it. I will leave this body say it. Say it. Say it. I will leave this body. I will leave this body. I will leave this body say it. (woman gasping) I will return to the pit. I will return to the pit. - I will return to the pit. - I will return to the pit. - I will return to the pit. (heavy breathing) - Jordan, I would like for you to lead us in a prayer. - Blessed and eternal God our Father, we ask for protection for our friend and neighbor Ascencion. Jesus sees that she's one of his children who's been blinded by the worldly darkness. He offers her his guiding hands, his strong arms, his divine love to lift her up and walk beside him in the light. Amen. (dramatic music) - I wonder why we haven't had any tricker treaters. We still have like a hundred tracts to give out. - Maybe the kids are scared to go-- - Guys, I talked to Pastor Tim today. He wanted me to tell everyone that he thinks we're doing a really great job, and he's super excited for us. Guys, this is our first baptism. How cool is that? - Super cool. - Kara, - What. - What's up? - Nothing. - Kara, come on. - Okay, that tattoo that eye thing it's from Martkedejos. - [Eli] Kedhos. - What tattoo? - The one on the back of Ascencion's neck. It's from Markedehos. They're a gang and they're super dangerous. They kill people with machetes, and their hand sign thing is like devil horns. There was this article in the Times. - Wow, really. - Yeah, there was this story where they kidnapped this teenage girl, and they made her to be a prostitute for them. They wouldn't give her any condoms, and then they killed her for giving someone an STD. - That's crazy. - Yeah, and then they cut her body into little pieces, and they sold her organs. They ate parts of her, and they threw the rest into the canyon. The reason that the cops identified her was because they found her teeth in the dumpster. - Kara, are you having doubts about the baptism? - No. I just think that we should think about it. - Okay, let's think about it. Jordan, thoughts? - I think that we all came here to share Christ's love in an area that has high need for it. I think that someone like that has the highest need. - Exactly. I mean that's the core foundation of the neighboring strategy. - I know. I'm not saying that we shouldn't help her. I'm just saying that we should think about it. They're a lot of factors you know. - What sort of factors? - Like the factor that she could kill us with a machete. - [Eli] Lindsey, that's not helping. - I mean what does the mission office say about gangs? Like is there a policy or something? I mean like what did your dad say when you talked to him? - Well, you can call Pastor Tim back if you like. - I thing it's awesome that she wants to get baptized. We should get those balloons, you know the white ones, the little white ones down at the liquor store. I'm sure we could like color them somehow. (doorbell ringing) Tricker treaters. Oh, my god. - Gosh darn it, guys. Did someone leave the George Foreman on again? - [Jordan] I think I might have. - [Eli] Guys, we have to be super careful with the breakers in this house. It's an old house. - [Jordan] I'm sorry. - [Eli] The doorbell probably over loaded it. - Yeah, I'll go flip the breaker at least. (lively music) - [Television Character] It's like a dream or a song. It feels like something beautiful, but you can't hold it in your hand. Should that make it be less real? (glass breaking) (tires screeching) - Guys on the floor. (tires screeching) (dog barking) (dramatic music) (television character singing faintly) (soft buzzing) - What is that? - Pipes. - Sounds like they're gonna explode. (dog barking) - They're old pipes. (car horn honking) - Should we get a gun? - You wanna shoot the pipes? - [Jordan] No. - [Eli] No, I don't think we should get a gun. - It was a stupid idea I guess. - You only get shot if you're a gangster. - Yeah. Yeah, totally. Why do you think-- - Hey, hold on. I was getting tired of talking to your feet. - I forgot what I was gonna say. - You know Ascencion really likes you. - What, what do you mean? - Yeah. She was really moved by that prayer you said for her. - No, no that was nothing. - Seriously I mean getting through to someone like that it's a big deal. I don't just mean from the gang aspect, but when you think about like the voodoo and the witchcraft and the blood sacrifice that's in a generational history I mean that's power stuff that you're doing battle with. - Yeah, but I mean you're the one that did all the work. You're the one that really helped her. - Yeah, you're right. She probably just thinks you're cute or something. - (laughing) Shut up. - [Eli] Night, buddy. - Night. (car horn honking) (dramatic music) - [Kara] Guys, guys wake up. - What's going on? - [Jordan] I don't know. - We got robed. - Oh, my gosh do you think that they're still in the house? - They took the folding chairs and the computer and my phone. - Heck, the keyboard. Dude, I am so sorry. - I mean seriously they took my phone. What if they call my mom? - Why would they call your mom? - I don't know to say dirty stuff to her. - What are we going to do? - Call the police. - No, that's a bad idea. - Why? - Because then we'd have a cop car in front of the house. - If there's a cop car in front of the house, then no one in the neighborhood's gonna trust us. - Yeah. We need them to trust us. We can't have them thinking we're gonna call a cop every 10 minutes. We don't wanna be outsiders. - They already think we're outsiders. They freaking robbed us. We're being targeted. - Why would they be targeting us. I mean all we've done is give these people food and prayed for them. I mean ungrateful can you--. - Ladies, listen to me for one moment all right. We are not being targeted. This is what's called a crime of opportunity. We learned about this. Alright we should've boarded up the window right after the drive by case closed. This is an opportunity. God is providing us with the chance to be better prepared next time that's it. - Eli's right. (woman gasping) - Oh, my gosh. - What? - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh. - That. (tense music) - Can you hold this? - [Jordan] Yeah, sure. - Got it? - Yeah, yeah. (dramatic music) - Sorry. - No, you're fine. - Careful I don't wanna get your hand. (Jordan mumbling) I don't think you have to hold it anymore. - Yeah, yeah. - Think I got a splinter. - Oh, no. Do you want me to try and get it? - Dude, where'd you get this? - I won it at MTYC, the frisbee golf thing. - Shot that's right frolf champ '08. - [Jordan] You know it. ♫ We are marching in the light of Jesus ♫ Marching in the light of God - Dude, please tell me you still have that hackie sack? - No, no I kicked it into the river 'cause I'm super coordinated. - That's a bummer I was gonna say we should play right now. - I know. - Here. - Okay, let's see it. Oh, yeah, yeah there it is. - Think you can get it? - I don't know it's in there pretty deep. - Come on. Use that frolf spirit. Dude, you would make a terrible surgeon. Look how shaky your hands are. - [Jordan] Yeah, yeah there it is. - You got it? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Hold on to it. - Yep. Dang, that's a big one.

It's not a step that you have to take in order to get into Heaven. It's about trust. It's a choice. It's a decision made by someone of age to have informed consent making a public profession of faith. Baptism is not about getting into Heaven. It's about living for Jesus Christ here on Earth. Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior? - Yes. - In obedience to our Lord and savior Jesus Christ and upon your profession of faith I baptize you my sister in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Buried with him in the likeness of his death and raised with him in the likeness of his resurrection. (police siren blaring) Hey, you've room for this one? - Yeah, yeah.

Lindsey are you okay? Can I come in? - Kara, this is really good. - Thanks. - So do you know where you're gonna go for your MDiv yet? - I mean Pastor Tim wants me to go to Southern Evangelical, but I kind of wanna go somewhere more new you know like Veritas or something. It's a long way off. - They're doing this really cool stuff like in Boston where - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. It's this new Lazarus program where you take your group and you put it on really strict budgets and diets and stuff. Yeah, and then you just give the rest of your money away. It's like this commitment to fighting poverty kind of stuff. - But I think poverty is a good thing. - Poverty is a good thing. - Yeah, I mean you get too comfortable you forget that you need Jesus. I'm not a huge fan of all the social justice stuff on the east coast. I mean you go to Heaven with your teeth fixed great. Go to hell with your teeth fixed not to great you know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah like it's not the right focus. - Yeah, I mean it's like the old saying you know you wanna teach people to fish not just give them a fish. - Yeah, 'cause if you just give them fish then they just they just want tartar sauce (laughing) right? - Exactly. Anyway I might go to Russia next year do discipleship there you know get some life experience. - Isn't that kind of dangerous though. I mean don't they kill evangelicals in Russia. - Well, it's super dangerous for sure. But in a way it's harder to be a missionary here in America. People hide their demons here. - I'm gonna get Lindsey a plate of food. - But didn't she say she wasn't hungry. - [Kara] No, I'm just gonna go see. - I could bring it to her if you-- - [Kara] Okay, I got it. - Tell her we hope she's feeling better. You know I do like your idea for the toy drive though. - Wait. Wait what did you? Oh, right. Yeah the toy drive that could be fun right? You had just mentioned the kids in the neighborhood and got me thinking. - You know, I think you would make a really great pastor someday. - Really. - [Eli] You should consider it, yeah. - I don't like to talk in front of people, like groups. It really makes me nervous. - Yeah, but that like makes you way more approachable to people. You know, you got this whole like sort of poet soul thing going on. Feeling better? - Huh? Are you feeling better? - Jordan, I'm going to give you a chance to explain yourself before I tell Eli what I saw. I think that it is your right and responsibility to this group and to God to be honest with all of us right now. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Yes, you do know. - No, I really, really don't. - I was walking down the hallway before dinner, Eli was in the shower, and the bathroom door was open. Jordan was watching Eli through the door and touching himself. (nervous laughter) - What? Seriously. No, I mean I was in hall, but... No, I was there to see if Eli was done in the shower. I mean we keep the door open because of the steam issue. I mean, yeah, I guess I could see why you would think that I was doing that, but... Was that why you ran off like that? - Jordan, denying it is only making it worse. I saw you, you were you know. I would not make this up, okay. Do you even realize how hard it is for me to say the words. I mean how do you think I feel. - I didn't. - Honestly, I mean I'm just sickened by this. Jordan, I'm not trying to attack you. I care about you. We all do. - Jordan, we're all on the same side here. Just tell us what happened, okay. - Nothing happened. (Jordan stammering) I don't know what I'm supposed to say. - The truth. - Lindsey. Just say yes or no. - I haven't been feeling well. - Yes or no. - I mean I was in the hall-- - Yes or no. - Yes. - We should pray. Blessed and eternal Father, - Blessed and eternal Father, we thank you for your power to deliver us from all bondage. We pray for Jordan that he may be released from this spirit of sexual perversion and forgiven for his wicked and vile actions. We ask that the fire of the Holy Spirit purge his soul in the name of Jesus. - Amen. Thank you, Lindsey. (emergency siren blaring) (pulsating drum beat) (dogs barking) - Hey, do you need help? - I'm good. There was a dead rat in here this morning. - Oh, really. I didn't even know that we had rats around here. I thought they were just like around the docks and stuff. I could get another sponge. - It's okay. Kind of one person job, you know. - Yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah. Purify my soul from darkness and deliver me from the struggles of my sins from the struggles my sins have built against me. I ask that you empower me with your power and wash me and wash me in the redeeming blood of Jesus Christ. Hey, where is everyone. - They went shopping for the toy drive. How are you feeling? - I'm okay. - I stayed behind because I wanted to talk to you. - Oh. Oh, okay. - I wanted to let you know that I think I understand your problem. - You do. - It's the neighborhood. - The neighborhood. - What you're feeling is Satan's influence. If we stay here long enough, he'll enter all of us. So that's why I think we need to leave. I mean I've given this a lot of thought, and I think it's the only solution that makes sense. - Have you talked to anyone else about this? - No, I wanted to talk to you first, so we can go to them together. They're not gonna listen if it's just me. - I'm gonna pray on this, okay. - Okay. - I'm gonna go for a run. - Can you get some toilet paper? I don't wanna go out there. - Sure. - And Dr. Skipper. - Why don't you make a list of whatever you want and I'll pick it up for you.

I just think I'll post it. (Lindsey giggling) Sorry.

I was talking to Pastor Tim you know how he gets. I'm just in a bad mood. - Eli, I'm backsliding. I can feel it. - You answered the altar call. You asked for forgiveness. You're on the right path just keep doing a good job. - I need more than that. Please. ♫ Just a closer walk with thee ♫ Grant it Jesus hear my plea ♫ Daily walking close to thee ♫ Let it be ♫ Dear Lord let it be - Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior? - Yes. - In obedience to our Lord and savior Jesus Christ and upon your profession of faith I baptize you my brother in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit. Buried with him in the likeness of his death (dramatic music) (women giggling) and raised with him in the likeness of his resurrection. So the guy's in trouble, right. He's runaway from home. He's partied with the gentiles. He spent all of his father's money and gone broke, so what does he do next? He goes - He goes. - He goes to a farm to feed pigs, and in the first century Greco-Roman culture Jewish people are forbidden from eating pork because pigs are considered unclean. So that's just a little bit of historical context. It basically makes what he does one of the lowest most degrading things that someone in his position could do. - But do you think he thinks it's degrading, or is it something-- - Worse than that worse than going to this farm to work with these unclean animals what happens in the next verse when he actually goes to feeds the pigs? - He longs for what the pigs are eating. - He longs for it. He yearns for it. He craves this slop. - What exactly is in first century slop? - What? - Just for historical context I was just wondering what exactly is in first century Greco-Roman slop? - Yeah, I don't know what's in first century slop. - Okay, I was just curious. - If you have an issue Jordan we can all discuss it. This is a safe space. - I don't have an issue. - Okay, see well I do. I have an issue with you intentionally derailing the study group. I think that all of our time would be best served if you went elsewhere to practice some quiet contemplation on your own. - Are you giving me a time out? - I am making a recommendation. (dramatic music) ♫ Blessed assurance Jesus is mine ♫ O' what a foretaste of glory divine ♫ Heir of salvation - [Kara] You're packing. - Yeah. - Should I pack? - I don't know, Kara. I think you should do whatever you want. - Jordan and I were just talking about if I should do potato salad or coleslaw. - Potato salad, right? It's more filling. Hey. Stop packing. Come and sit with me. Man, I've been a horrible friend. You're going through hell and I haven't been there for you at all. - I wouldn't wanna be around me either if I was you. I'm a pervert. - No. You're someone who's asking for help. I haven't been strong enough to give that to you, but I am now. - I don't think you can. - [Eli] I'm willing to try if you are. - How? - Tell me everything. - What do you mean? - How it started? What it's like? Every thought. Look I know this is kind of awkward. Honestly this is how I would counsel anyone. We'll just pretend that it's not about me. Really I'm cool with it. - Yeah, I'm not really sure how to answer that question. - Just tell me when you started noticing feeling stuff like this. - I don't know it's just random thoughts will just pop into my head. It's like they're not even my thoughts. - What kind of thoughts specifically? - No, it's not like I wanna act on them or anything. It's not like I even feel that way about men in general. It's just when I think... Like when it's more specific. - I mean that's great. I mean you just said you don't wanna act on it and that is the most important part. What concerns me is that you said these thoughts don't feel like your own. Do you mean that literally? - Yeah. Yeah, I think so. It's like I can't even control them at all. - Do you feel sick in your stomach? You can't eat? How's your sleep? - Terrible. - Do you hear voices? - Maybe. I think so. - May I? - [Jordan] Yeah. - I've never told anyone this before. When my sister was 13, she manifested a demon, a really powerful one. - She did. - I won some goldfish at the fair and we came home. She took them out of my tank and put them on the window sill. She made me watch as they suffocated to death. Your heartbeat's really fast. - So what happened? - She started hurting me. I didn't tell anyone about it. Eventually she took a hockey stick, and she hit me in the face. She knocked out my teeth. That was when Pastor Tim realized that she had manifested a demon of rage. They performed a deliverance on her, and they cast the demon out. She went back to normal for the most part. - You're kind of scaring me. - I don't wanna scare you. I wanna help you. - Always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones, but when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said, "What have I to do with thee, Jesus "the Son of the Most High God. "I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not." For he said unto him, "Come out of the man thou unclean spirit." The unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea. There were about 2,000 of them and were choked in the sea. (tense music) They went out to see what it was that was done. They came. They came to Jesus and see him see he that was possessed with the devil devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid. (tense music) (people laughing) (tense music) - Can I get you anything, Pamela? - They're shooting horses out west. - Excuse me. - They're over populated out there. They shoot them from the airplanes now. I think that's terrible, just terrible. (foreign language spoken) - This is my friend Blanca. - Blanca, mucho gusto. Any friend of Ascencion a friend of ours. I hope you guys are hungry. We have some great food. Where are you from? Yeah, so we got hotdogs and I think some hamburgers somewhere. Hey, buddy. You okay. - You have to submit. You have to submit to Jesus. You have to allow him to cast out them out like the pigs off the cliff. - Hey, Jordan, listen to me I think Kara needs some help. - Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah okay. - You should come inside and lie down for a bit. You don't look very good. I'll come check on you in a bit, okay? I'll bring you some tuna mac then we can talk. - So the old lady yells Acts 2:38 and the robber freezes. He stops what he's doing. The cops get there and they say to him, "All the old lady did was yell a bible verse. "Why'd you stop?" He says, "Bible verse I thought she said "she had an ax and two 38s." (foreign language spoken) - I would've gotten out of there. - Okay, so basically Acts 2:38 is a bible verse that says if you repent and you're baptized then your sins will be forgiven. - Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. - Exactly. Anyway we have a ton of leftover food. I hope you guys will take some with you. - No, no we can't. - I'll give you guys extra so that you can have some for the people you live with too. - It wouldn't be a good idea because then they will know that we was here. - You know there are safe places. People can protect you. I can help you. - You've already helped me. I used to live with evil inside of me, and now I have the love of Jesus. - I know you do, but you can't worship Jesus and live in the devil's house. You know what I mean? - [Kara] Jordan. (tense music) Are you okay? (Jordan growling) (Kara gasping) - [Lindsey] Kara. (Jordan muttering foreign dialect) (suspenseful music) - Was that Spanish? (Jordan gurgling) - Jordan, can you hear me? We're gonna get through this. It's gonna be okay. I'm right here. (soft buzzing) (tense music) Jordan. (dog barking) (Jordan gurgling) If there is an evil presence inside of this body, I'm speaking to you now. I'm giving you a warning. It is in your best interest to leave now. Release Jordan. (Jordan gasping) Do you hear me, huh? Do you hear me in there? - [Jordan] I feel sick. - Jordan, leave us. Go be safe with God. I wanna speak with the demon now. Reveal yourself you fag demon. (Jordan gasping) I pierce you with God's sword. You want me so bad come out and get me. (Jordan muttering) What was that? I can't hear you is your mouth too full of Satan's penis? Hey. Submit yourself therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands ye sinners, and purify your hearts ye double minded. Be afflicted and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourself in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. (tense music) Get off of me. - Is everything okay? I heard shouts when I was in the kitchen. I didn't know if there was something wrong. - Grab that belt. You secure his wrists. I'll hold him. Loop it around. Tighter. Kara. That's good. You can go close the door. (Jordan gasping) You're not Jordan. What's your name? Look at me. What is your name? What is your name? - You look nice tonight, Elijah. - What is your name? - What do you want it to be? - What authority do you have over this body? - None. I have no authority. - Then I command you to release Jordan, and go back to the burning pits of hell where you belong. - Good I want to burn. - You want to leave this body? - I want you to come inside and get me. There's a difference. - Well, that should be easy. You're not a very strong demon are you? - No. No, I'm not. I'm powerless and useless, defenseless, helpless. - Jesus' love will destroy you. - Will it. - God is in charge. - That sounds good. Play God take charge. - [Eli] I release Jordan say it. - No. - I will receive say it. I will receive say it. Say it. - No. - I will receive. - I will receive. I will receive. - God's judgment say it. - Make me. Make me. - Say it. - Make me. - I will fucking make you. (tense music) Is this what you want? I break your curse of defilement and perversion. I reject Satan's power, and replace it with the redeeming blood of Christ. The Holy Spirit demands it. Jesus wills it. God commands it. (tense music) Release him. Release Jordan. - Eli. - Jordan. (heavy breathing) ♫ Love lifted me ♫ Love lifted me ♫ When nothing else would help ♫ Love lifted me ♫ Love lifted me ♫ Love lifted me ♫ When nothing else could help - [Eli] Hey, tell me the truth. - What. - I picked the wrong song. - What, no way it was perfect. - Yeah, but I thought of like 10 better ones like right after. - Stop seriously it was awesome. - Hey, have you seen Ascencion? She never misses Sunday service. I'm a little worried about her. - No, when's the last time you talked - Someone's following me. - Jesus is following you. He follows you to protect and watch over you. Jordan, would you like to lead us in a prayer for Pamela? - Yeah. - Good call. Getting kind of chubby anyway. - You know I was thinking Psalms 28 would have been a stronger choice. - Are you serious. - Yeah, or Psalms 68. Give us your strength as you have done before. - Are you serious or are you joking. - Really any other Psalms would have been a better choice. Than the one you chose (laughing). Whoa, Eli, stop it. Get off me, Eli. (woman screaming) (tense music) - I'll call the police. - I'm calling my mom. - Why? - So she can pick me up. I wanna go home. - Kara. - Someone give me a phone. - Okay. I understand thank you. It's not an actual emergency, so if we wanna make a report, we have to take some photos and go down to the station ourselves. - Should we all go together? - Maybe someone should stay here. - I think we should all go. I don't think there's any real danger, but it's best to be on the safe side. - My mom's here. - Hey, Jordan can you go check my jeans for my keys. I'm gonna snap a few photos then we can go. - Yeah, sure. - [Lindsay] I just don't feel safe with him around anymore. I can't help it. - Lindsay, I saw the demon leave him. He doesn't even remember it happening. What's happening right now has nothing to do with him. - At least tell me that you're not going to share a bed with him again. - What does that have to do with anything? Yeah, I don't see why not. - Seriously. - Hey. We're gonna share a bed together someday you and me. I promise. - You mean that. - You bet I do. But until then don't make me sleep on a lumpy old couch. - Okay. (glass breaking) (Jordan growling) - Lindsay, Stop. Help me get him to the bedroom. Run ahead and open the door. (Jordan gasping) Find something to restrain him with. I thought we got rid of you. - No, never, never. - You are going to learn to do what I as a man of God say. (tense music) - [Lindsay] Will this work? - I'll hold him down you tie him. Tie him tight. (Jordan muttering) Grab that belt. You can leave now. - No way I'm staying. - Leave. Leave. - She's staying. Hey, look at me. - Eli, what's happening to (slapping). - I will receive God's judgment say it. - Fuck you. - I release him and return to the fiery pit say it. - There is no pit. - I will leave. Lindsay, grab that cross from the living room. (tense music) (heavy breathing) (Jordan muttering) Spirit of perversion come out. Come out in the name of Jesus. - Come out. Leave this body and return to the pit. - I am light say it. I release Jordan and return to the pit say it. I release Jordan. - No. No. - Lindsay, get a belt or something stronger. I don't know if I can hold him. Lindsay. - Stop. (tense music) - Give me that. Tie him again tighter this time. Turn over so she can tie your hands. (Jordan gasping) (Jordan crying) - Eli, help me. Eli, please. - Jordan. - Don't listen to it. It's just the demon trying to fool you. - Filthy sex demon. Show it, Eli. Take the sword of the spirit and cut right through it. Show it that if it doesn't come out on it's own we're going to go in after it. Show it, show it. - I have committed perverse thoughts and actions, and I am ready to receive God's judgment say it. - I have committed perverse thoughts and acts. - Ready to receive God judgment say it. - I am ready to receive (screaming) - God, release it. Release it. - Come out demon. I release you with God's power. I spill your diseased blood, and fill you up with the spirit. I spill your perversion, and fill you with the spirit. (Jordan screaming) (Jordan mumbling) (Jordan crying) - I'm telling you Jordan is the one responsible for the goat head. I mean you can see what he's capable of. He's completely manifested. I think we should call your dad. - I think we should spend some time in quiet contemplation. - Of course you do. - I'm gonna take a shower, okay. Why don't you make yourself some tea or something. We'll figure out what we're gonna do after that. (dog barking) (tense music) (water splashing) - Did you get our messages? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Ascencion won't be coming back here anymore. Blanca won't be coming back here anymore. If you're very, very careful I won't be coming back here anymore. You know what I'm talking about now? (suspenseful music) (Jordan gasping) (Lindsay screaming) (Lindsay gasping) - No. (Lindsay screaming) (loud thud) (water splashing) (tense music) (Eli singing faintly) ♫ Jesus keep me from all harm ♫ Jesus kept me from all harm ♫ I'll be satisfied as long ♫ I'll be satisfied as long ♫ As I walk ♫ Let me walk ♫ Close to you (door squeaking) - I command you to get back on the bed. (tense music) - Jordan. Jordan, stop. Jordan, stop. Jordan, wait, wait. Jordan, Jordan no. Jordan, no. Jordan. Jordan. No, son. No, son I'm speaking to Jordan now. Jordan, I'm speaking to Jordan now. Please stop. Stop (crying). Jordan, I need you please just leave. (screaming) Fuck, Jordan. Stop what are you doing. No, no, stop. Jordan. (Eli screaming) (Eli crying) No, Jordan, no (crying). Stop. (tense music) (Eli crying) Jordan. I forgive you. Let me help you. Pray with me.
