Hey! Eyes on the wheel, please! Don't look to the backseat. I'm sorry, Miss. I was checking my rearview mirror. It's a little bit wobbly. I don't want it to loose. - Excuse me. - Hi. Your bag! - It sure can happen. - Huh? "Can two people be happily married without any love?" Of course! Just like us. We just met. There are no affection and love yet. But then, we're married. You know what that's called? Hey! - S-O-U-L-M-A-T-E. - Geez! - Soulmate. - What are you doing? My grandma once told me, "Love can be found everywhere". Are you alone in this trip? How long will you stay in Bali? Where do you want to go? Kuta, Legian, Seminyak, Singaraja? - You hurt your foot? - No! Then you'll be able take a tour with me. Fierce girl. I've been predicted three times that I'll find my soulmate in an airplane. Three times! But I don't believe that. But today,... ... I'm convinced. Maybe... ... we are soulmate. I wanna go to the toilet. I'll be back. You can't wait for me, huh? Thanks for saving me. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We're at the altitude of 38,000 feet or 12,000 meter above sea level. The travel time is about one hour 10 minutes. It's you again. - Where's your fiance? - Fiance? When I went to the toilet at the airplane,... ... there was a guy who asked me to switch seat. He said, he's your fiance. That's why I switched seat. He's very old-fashioned. Not stylish like me. Taxi! Sir! Taxi! Taxi! Hey! It's you. - Why are you standing there? - I'm trying to get a cab. You're not gonna get one, even if you stand there until tomorrow. Why? -Oh, I didn't see that sign. -You can ride with me. All right. So, you often travel alone, huh? Well, I do. My mom always says that I'm an independent girl. I'm an only child. Only child is usually spoiled, but not me. How long will you stay in Bali? Hello? You know what? Do you know the host whom I auditioned and trained painstakingly? She canceled the agreement all of a sudden,... ... because her thread-lift surgery was failed and now her face is bleeding. Now I want to yell at her management for their unprofessional talent! Why did she have to do a thread-lift anyway? It's better to invest the money in the stock exchange! You mean, we'll go without a host? Just find the replacement, okay? You know many talent managements here. Please find it. We're close to our deadline. We have to leave on schedule. I don't know your name yet. Guys, these are fixed locations for our next shooting. But now the problem is, we don't have a host. Is it possible if we extend the deadline and the presentation schedule? We can't do that! We've worked hard so we can have a merger with this company. If we postpone our presentation schedule from the get go,... ... they'll see us as a bunch of unprofessional people! Hi! It's you! You! My God! We meet again! This is your friend? You know her? - What are you doing here? - I come here for two reasons. First, because I know you're looking for a host. Second, because I didn't get a chance to know your name yesterday. Ga, you choose this type of girl to be our host? Come on, we don't have time for silly things like this. What do you mean "silly"? What's wrong with me? Look, I know I don't have too many experience,... ... but I was browsing the Internet all night long,... ... learning all techniques from best hosts from Indonesia and all over the world. I learned everything in one night. Why can't you believe in my capability? Should we do casting right now? Okay. why don't you show us how you host a show? All right. Good day, folks. Hi! Here with me again, Aletta. In the next 30 minutes, I will be your host in this show called... ... Geography Channel. My gosh! - Do you know anything about our program? - No. If you hire this type of girl, everything will be ruin! - Hey, I haven't decided yet. - Wait a minute. But I think she's quite pretty and unique. And I think she's okay in front of the camera. Why don't we give her a chance to be our host? Look, young lady. So, just because you've seen all hosts... ... from Indonesia and all over the world via Internet,... ... you think you deserve to be our host? Let me tell you something. This isn't just some show. This is not a cheesy show. It's classy one. You're not qualified or whatsoever to support this show. Just go home, look at a mirror and erase that far off imagination. Geez, Jonas! Your face is bitter and your words are harsh. I came here with good intention to help you,... ... because you've helped me yesterday. But if you guys say no, that's fine. Arga, what should we do? What should we do? What's wrong with you? You're disturbing my nap time! - Hurry up. - Okay, okay! Alleta! Wake up! We're here! If you're still sleeping, I'll flush you with water! Hurry! Where's the hotel? Who said we're going to stay at a hotel? Bring your stuff! Don't be a spoil brat. - Exhausting. - What's a matter with you? I'm exhausted. Let's go. Come on! Here, let me help you. Easy. One, two, three! Are you ok? I need to sit for a while. Thanks, Rimba. I forgot to thank you too for defending me at the office. That's all right. They are also friendly like me. But, well... You know... Only Jonah who is a bit cynical. Maybe he had a head trauma at early age, so he becomes like that. I want to call my girlfriend. There's no signal here. We still have a signal, even though it's weak. Bugy is also cool, isn't it? But he's the weirdest though. He always makes everything fun. Amazingly, he's the only one among us who already has a girlfriend. Hi, Darling. What are you doing? Arga is also friendly, but he's quiet and doesn't talk much. Many girls have been trying to ask him out and make a move on him, but they failed. - Arga already has a girlfriend? - That's a wrong question. You should ask, "How many girls have been trying to make a move on him?" That's the right question. He's very cold when it comes to women. He only loves his bike. Look at him. He's a weird, but that's who he is. He really loves the nature, he always rides on his bike during breaks. Hold on. - Is that your boyfriend? - No. So, where were we on your story? - Is he really a cold person? - Yeah. If you're looking for a warm guy, that's me. What's wrong? I sprained my ankle. It really hurts. Do you need to be carried? Yeah, I'd love to. Rimba. Yeah? What's up? Could you carry her? She said she prained her ankle. - So, you asked her to go home? - Yeah. I came to her place that night. I wanted to say sorry for Jonah's behavior. I think she has a good intention. She sincerely wants to help us. Nice! I love your instinct. Now that's a leader! Hey, guys! Get out of the tents. I wanna say something. Get out and get around here! No one stays in the tent! Attention, everyone. Don't be late tomorrow. We'll go to the dock down there. And you, young lady! Stay out of trouble. Okay, go back to your tents. It's late! Go to sleep! Geez, how rude! You're just like a mean landlord! Look at your friend. Aletta. Get some rest, okay? - Good night. - Good night, Rimba. Arga. Where's Aletta? She's not in her tent. What? Are you serious? Can't you see I'm panicked? Of course I'm serious! I've searched everywhere! I couldn't find her. See? I knew from the start, this girl would only bring trouble. I bet she ran away. Are you guys happy now? Aletta! No, that's impossible. There's no way Aletta ran away. There she is. Huh, you're wrong, right? I thought you sprained your ankle. You already read the rundown, right? So I don't have to explain it again. And don't make any mistakes! Not a single one! Bugy, what's wrong with you? I'm feeling sea sick. If you throw up in this boat, you must clean it yourself! Oh no! He really throws up! Aletta. Which part should I read? - The one I wrote. - Okay. There are 45 national parks in Indonesia. Put down the script, will you? You should have memorized it! - What? - Shut up! That komodo is getting closer. Let's get out of here. Better dealing with a vegetarian komodo. It's getting closer. Help! - More or less... - Looks like this is serious. - Where are you going? - Aletta, come on! - It is proven to contain bacteria... - Aletta, follow them back. - No. - It's all right. - Just get back. For your safety. - This is my job. - You don't have to do that. - No, Arga. But komodo's saliva... Arga! Okay. Action! Cut! Can't you look neat? - What's wrong? - If you can't do this, just go home! - You're a burden for us. - Ok, just chill, man. You collar is folded. There. Keep rolling. Action! - Okay, everybody. - Cut! Look at that! You chose that host. - I already put it at the front. - Tell her! Don't change the position of your tag. Don't move this tag. It has to be shown. Put it in front of you. Don't change it. Relax, Jon. Don't get mad. Action! That's the story of the survival... I mean, the life of komodo. Komodo is in which... Umm... Commonly know as Varanus komodoensis. It's the biggest lizard in the world and only found in Indonesia. I still can't find the greatness of our show. This is so mediocre. Flat, nothing special and there's no soul. It's no wonder. The script made by Jonah is like a wedding ceremony rundown. Excuse me. If you guys don't mind, I would like to share some of my ideas. - Maybe it will... - You'd better think before you speak. Who do you think you are? You're just a new kid. What do you know about this kind of program? Exactly! I'm indeed a new kid. I'm not a professional or an expert in this field like you guys. But that's the point. As an audience, I can see the strength and weakness of this program. - What is the weakness? - Listen to what I'm trying to say! - Let her speak. - What? So, here's my idea. I think... ... in this kind of situation, there are few things that... The show relies too much on the rundown and too scripted... ... and it's not supposed to be like that. We have to be more free and explore everything. Just show our adventure to the audience. What we really feel. We have to give them some tips. Let them feel the emotion. Am I right? Maybe. Aletta. Why does the shooting need to be 30 days? So it can be perfect. I set it 30 days because of you. Do you think I made this script without thinking? - Use your brain! - Enough, Jonah! You defend her again? Why do you always defend her? Are you falling in love with her? Is that why you came to her place and asked her to join us? I'm suspicious. There's no way you asked her to come back for nothing. Or... - Or what? - Are you a host and a call girl? - What did you say? - Host and a call girl. Watch your mouth, Jon! What do you mean by that? I do this for this team! What's wrong with you? If you have a problem with me let's settle it right now! Why do you keep silent? Talk to me! Why do you keep silent? Do you wanna hit me? Come on, hit me! Come on, hit me! I didn't say a word from the first time you discredited Aletta. Until just now, I still shut my mouth. But my silence doesn't make you stop and realize that we are a team! We are a team! You can't do just whatever you want or do one man show here. One failure means a failure for all of us. And if we succeed, it's not because one or two persons. That's because a team effort. So, please be professional. It's all up to you. Whether you wanna go... ... or stay right here. May I sit down here? Go ahead. Thanks for the flower. Why exactly do you visit Bali? You don't have any experience as a host,... ... but why do you want to join us? What makes you stay here? Well... Because I think I have an opportunity here. What do you mean? What's a matter, Aletta? Is there something funny? I want our royal blood to stay in the family. You must marry a guy that I've chosen for you. The best one in lineage, economic status, and quality. This is serious, Aletta. - Do I have a choice? - No. There's no choice for you. - Aletta? - Have you been waiting for me? Sorry. You know, this is Jakarta. Traffic jam everywhere. And this morning is very hot! Gives me headache and makes me thirsty. - Have you ordered a drink? - Wait, I'll get the waitress. Have you decided yet, which wine would you order? - Think I'll have orange juice for today. - What about you, Ma'am? Vodka, double shot. On the rock. Al. - Are you sure that's the right order? - Yes! I've told you I'm thristy. I can choose whatever drink I want. Don't be so fussy! - Here's your order. - Thanks. I arranged our meeting in my usual restaurant. Because I really wanted to prank that guy. I told the waitress to change the vodka into mineral water. My stomach bloats every time I drink soda, let alone vodka! - You're pretty nuts, huh? - Yeah, I guess. - Did that guy believe that? - Yeah, he believed it. - I like seeing you laugh. - Huh? I've never seen you laughing before. - Why are you smiling? - Nothing. I'm just wondering. You always seem so cheerful and smile all the time. Always look very happy. But if I look into your eyes, I think you're hiding something. Because usually someone who expresses happiness excessively... ... is actually trying so hard to conceal a sadness. Is that so? Call me, I want to talk. It's important. Dhito How long will you stay here? - I don't know. - What do you mean? I'll never come back to that house. My mom and mygrandma will never change their decision. So, that's useless, right? - Can I ask one thing from you? - What? I want you to go back to your home. - One more time, please. - Okay. The more I see her, she looks even cuter. She's fun too. - Your face is awful. - This is cute! - So adorable. - You mean Bugy? Come on, bro! Bugy is like a jellyfish. I mean Aletta. It's so hot. I think I like her. But hey, wait a minute. You're not after her, aren't you? It's very hot. Here. Keep this for me. Ta, I spotted Arga pay attention to you quite often. He is handsome. That's nonsense. You look awkward. It's shown in your face. No. - You like him, right? - I'll throw this phone to the sea. No. But that's your phone, right? Come on, guys. - You coming? - What do you think? There aren't enough crews. Do you think you can rely on your host? Me and Rimba will go down, that's enough. An instructor will also coming with us. How long will you record all the area? Until you run out of oxygen? I'm coming down with you guys, okay? I'm still the project manager here. I don't want this to fail. You just don't want to miss this diving session. Gosh, Jonah. One more thing. Cancel the instructor. We can handle this. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Just the three of us. I can never understand him. Just ignore him. The most important thing is you should record every area. Okay. I only use small camera. You guys almost finish. See you tomorrow, okay? Okay. Where's Jonah? Isn't Jonah already up here? Let's go! - Where is he? - I thought he was with you. Aletta! Aletta! Aletta! - Aletta, wake up! - Aletta! Surprise! You guys look scared. You guys scared, aren't you? What are you doing? You are such a childish! And I know yesterday your ankle isn't hurt, isn't it? That's why I told Rimba to carry you. And your joke this time... ... isn't funny at all! I do all of that because I want to have your attention. You want to get my attention? You run out of idea? Like what? - Is there other way? - Your being childish. You are a selfish person. You don't even think if your action is going to hurt others. Arga! I know why you mad. Because you're feeling have changed, right? Because now your afraid of losing me, right? I can feel that. You don't have to lie to me. Rimba was right... ... girls have a hard time knowing you because your too cold. But now things are different. I know you care about me. You know my feeling? Al. People are different. How people show their attention also have a different approach. It must be different. How Rimba show his attention to you. This isn't about Rimba, this is about you. Aren't you have any feeling for me, loving me? Actually, I like you. I care about you. But if you ask... ... if I love you or not... And one thing... ... about the flowers... ... that's not from me. That's from Rimba. This will be great. So pretty. Ga. - What are you doing? - This is for you. For me? You right, Ga. Everybody have their ways of falling in love. No wonder you didn't answer my question. You need the answer yourself. Congrats, man. Finally you found a girl that can make you fall in love. And now... ... I know the reason why she's here. You all right, Jon. I'm okay. Ga, I'm sorry. - All this time I've been so annoying... - Relax, man. It's okay, man. Al. Can I talk to you for a minute? I just want to thank you. You... ... save me earlier this day. The problem is... Okay. Arga. Are you still mad at me? Do you? Don't mad at me, please. All right then. Can you teach me how to ride a bicycle? Please? Using your bicycle. There are 45 national parks in Indonesia... ... spreading across Sabang to Merauke. Cool! I'm awe to the fact that a girl like you... ... can hold your breath that long under water. You don't know, Ga. I also good in karate. - Is that so? - Yeah. So, what now? Still feel you don't have any choices? Now I have a choice. I always want to fall in love... ... with someone that gives me a lot of memory so I can't forget him. What do you think? Can you force someone to love? I never think about love. Because I think a perfect love will come without a plan. Guys, we can't fly today. Because there's a malfunction with our rented plane. - What? - Then, what should we do? Relax! There's a solution. Why you don't take photos? You usually take photo. Sometimes, there are moments... ... that are too beautiful to be capture by camera. Just use our heart to capture it. Why are you smiling? No. It's all right. - What's the look? - No. I just want to thank you. Because without you... ... my show will not be on time to get a new host. That means my job will never done. Not only that. I also can... ... witnessing this situation in a different situation. Wait for me! This book is for you. Thank you. Baby bear hug! You know what? We don't need 30 days to make everything perfect. This situation is more than enough... ... to make me fall in love with you. I love you! You know what? There is a thing called love. And you can't see that. But you can feel it in your heart. You don't need someone that can fulfill your life. All you need is somebody that can accept you. Al. Last day at the tent... ... I prepared this for you. What's this? When your birth day come... ... if I'm not shown up yet... ... open this. Okay? Sometimes... ... even people that doesn't know each other... ...can fall in love and be happy. I thought your going to say that "L" word? You'll know the answer tonight. Al. I want to give this world to you. But because that's not possible,... ... I want to give you the most important thing in my life. My world. I love you. Why it is so hard for you to tell that you love her? I want to give something special to her. Come on. Aletta. I'll miss you so much, Aletta. Al! - Come on, let's go. - Aletta. - Don't be a drama queen! - Let me go! Ga. Mr. Sastro and his team come a little late. How many hours should I wait? I got a plane to catch. What do you mean, Ga? We're about to present and now you want to go? Gi, this is their fault. I trust you with this. I'm going now. I don't have much time. - Hi. - Hey. - It's for you. - What's this? My friendship gift. It's a surprise. - Are you serious? - Yes! Geez, that's very sweet of you! - Thanks, bro. - Take care. See you at the next project. Safe flight, okay? I need to go back. I haven't finished my editing. - You haven't finished? - The meeting will start soon! - Let me see your work! - Our client is on his way. - I'm almost finished, okay? - No, let me see it! Drive faster! Arga! Our presentation was a big success! - We are the winning team. - Check this out, Ga. The client loved our presentation materials, especially our host. Don't say like that. You'll make Arga sad. Relax, Ga. I bet the host will always like you. Don't you worry. We already had a deal with the client. - Let's a have a long distance cheers! - Yeah! You're insane! - Yes. Hold on a moment. - Okay. Arga: Have fun. See you! Aletta: Can't wait to see you. Arga: MYA. Aletta: What's MYA? Arga: Miss You Already. Aletta: So hard to say "I miss you", huh? I miss you too. Dear passengers, this is your flight team speaking. We're at the altitude of 38,000 feet or 12,000 meter above sea level. The travel time is about one hour 10 minutes. I thought you're gonna say "I love you". Does anybody bring a power bank? Can I borrow it? Or maybe a charger? Do you have a charger? I Love You From 38.000 Feet - This is your birthday. - I know. Wait a minute, okay. Yes, yes, okay. Dear passengers, there's an emergency. - What's going on? - Bad weather. Please keep your safety belt on. - Allahu Akbar! - Allahu Akbar! I Love You From 38,000 Feet Collections of Prayer For Traveling Mayday! Mayday! Control! Yes, Al, you do have a choice. But have you ever falling in love? So, Arga had this paper all along. No wonder I couldn't find this everywhere. As I promised to you,... ...I'm gonna say a special word in the special day. There was a reason why I asked you to wait until you blew the candle. Because I was hoping I could be there and you didn't have to read this letter. I will say "I love you", right in front of you. I love you too, Arga. At first I didn't know you at all, but after our time together,... ...something that initially didn't exist, has now become a reality. It came so suddenly. I was preparing the courage to express my feeling for you. That I'm actually in love with you. I'll come to Jakarta to meet your family,... ... especially to meet your grandma... ... who always sees the importance of lineage, economic status, and quality. I didn't give you an expensive gift,... ... but you should know... ... that this bottle contains air from places we've been through together. Every moment we shared together,... ... when I still didn't realize that I'm in love with you. When memories are too beautiful to be captured by a camera,... ... let's just simply breath in those memories... ... so they will reside in our heartbeat and pulse. Happy birthday! And you know what? I love you more than just words. I love you. Al. Wake up, honey. Your friend comes by. Al! Al, wake up! Arga? - Bugy? - Aletta. What's wrong? Arga's plane was crashed last night. Again, another plane crash incident. Indo Island Link plane went down at 00:15 pm. It carried passengers from Bali to Jakarta and crashed on the north of Java Sea. Up until now, Basarnas continues to comb the area... ... to look for the victims and the plane wreckage. Sir, may I see the passengers' list? I'm looking for "Arga Samudra". Someone also asked that name earlier. You can check it here. Samudra Hartawijaya, Arga National Search and Rescue Agency of Republic of Indonesia (Basarnas) Mr. Budi. We found a distress... ... in six degree coordinate, 82 minutes 30 seconds to the south... ... and 120 degree, 27 minutes 41 seconds to the east. We should check this. Can we pass through, please? Aletta! - Whoa, easy, easy! - Let me come through! - Easy. - I only need a minute, okay? Arga! No, let me go! - Aletta. - Easy, young lady. - That's not him. - Okay, be calm, Aletta. That's not him. Aletta! - Wait, Aletta! - Sir, can you please open that? - Yes, open it! - Okay. - Aletta! - Is it Arga? - Hurry up, open it! - Yes, open it, so she can see it. - That's not him? - No. Don't worry, we're still searching. We haven't recovered all victims. Be patient. Watch your mouth! Why did you say that? I'm doing this for the team! You can't just do whatever you like! You can't do one man show here! You know what? You're right. Everyone has a different way to fall in love. Congrats, bro! You finally found someone that can make you fall in love. I Love You From 38,000 Feet Al, Dhito is here. He wants to see you. - Come in, Dhito. I'll leave you two alone. - Okay, thanks. Aletta. I'm now at the crash site of Indo Island Link airplane. So far, 35 victims are found dead from all 198 passengers. The bodies will be sent immediately to Jakarta for identification... Al? Hello, anybody there? Does anybody there? Hello! Hey, young lady! They're not at home. I never think about love. For me, a perfect love will come itself and we don't have to plan it. I really want to give the whole world to you. But since that's impossible,... ... so I'm gonna give you the most important thing in my life. My world. I promise, tonight I'm gonna give you an unforgettable surprise. So, is this the surprise that you talked about? The surprise that I will never forget for the rest of my life? Why, God? This is the first time I feel so happy and in love,... ... but why do You have to end all of this? God, why do You take him away from me so quickly? A Year Later I'm glad, all the wedding preparations are settled. Dhito and Aletta will become the happiest couple. Just like Ajeng and Suryo. I was your matchmaker too. Now look both of you. You guys become a happy family, right? Aletta hasn't finished taking a shower. Why don't we wait for her before we start our dinner? - Dhito, let's wait for Aletta, okay? - Okay, Oma. I once prayed to God to send me someone who can make me smile again. And then, you came. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask Him... ... to send me someone that I can have forever. Not just someone who came for a while, and then gone forever. Just like a breath that needs its air and leaves that miss they tree,... ... how empty my heart feels, it is longing for your smile. Though I realize, not every question has the answer... ... not every yearning has its cure... ... but I'm still here. Just waiting, along with all the memories about you. Al. Just let him go, honey. He has rest in peace up in Heaven. We just need to keep sending prayers for him. But I just can't let him go, mom. I can never do that. As long as his body hasn't been recovered, I can never let him go. He promised me to come. Al, I'm really sure... ... Arga would want you to move on with your life. You gotta stop blaming yourself. You should be happy. For Arga's sake. Okay, honey? - Good day! How may I help you? - Hi. We want to do a wedding dress fitting, registered on behalf of Aletta. - Okay. Wait a moment, please. - Ok. Have a seat, honey. Wow, Tiara. You look very beautiful. You will be a perfect bride. Al, quit your sorrow, please? Soon you will live a new life. It's time for you to get over someone who will never return. Okay, sweetheart? You haven't had your breakfast. You'll get sick if you don't eat. Let me bring you some food. Hello? Hello? Aletta. - Al. - Aletta. - Honey. - Aletta. - Aletta. Sweetheart. - Honey. - Al, please wake up. - Aletta. Al. Are you okay? - Aletta. - Aletta. - Aletta? - What's wrong, Al? What is it? - Mom. It's about Arga. - What's a matter with him? Arga is still alive! - Arga is still alive! - Mother? Aletta! - Get her! - Okay, I will. Let me borrow your car. Aletta! Aletta! Yes? I know Arga is still alive. Can I see him? Who are you? I'm Aletta. Arga's girlfriend. I see. Well, why do you come here? I need to see him. All along I've been praying for Arga and I thought he has passed away,... ... but this morning I heard his voice. It was Arga's voice. I need to see him. Please, I'm begging you. Consider Arga has died! So, don't you ever disturb my son anymore! Please, I'm begging you. Let me see Arga. Aletta. Aletta! Aletta, what's wrong with you? Why do you become so delusional like this? Arga had left us a year ago. Don't torture yourself like this! - We better go home. - No way! I won't go home. I will stay here and waiting for Arga. I once had a perfect life because of him. But then I woke up one morning and I lost everything. I lost the only hope and dream I had... ... without be given any hunch or premonition And now Arga has given back Arga to me. You do not know how it feels to miss someone,... ... yet you can do nothing about it. All this time, I just want to sleep without having to wake up. Because I'm hoping to see Arga in dream, even if it's only a second. I always play all of our videos and look at his pictures. I always read all of his chats, because those are the only things I got. We will meet Arga here. Please, just trust me. Please. I'm here, Arga. I'm here. Aletta! Aletta, why are you still standing here? Let's just go home. Standing in the rain will make you sick. Come on, let's go. Let me drive. You just sit next to me. In order to save time, let us begin this wedding. - Please, Sir. - Okay. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. I'm uniting Anandito Sastrodiningrat bin Hadi Sastrodiningrat... ... with Aletta Wiryosudirjo binti Suryowirosudirjo... ... with a set of praying apparatus as the dowry. I'm accepting Aletta Wiryosudirjo as my wife.... ... binti Suryowirosudirjo with the dowry... I'm sorry, Sir. I can't continue this marriage. What do you mean, Dhito? Forgive me, Dad. Al. I don't deserve to be here. He's the one who deserves it. - Him? - I mean Arga. He's here. Arga. Arga. You look beautiful. You're the most beautiful bride I've ever imagined. I'm grateful to God that I'm given a chance to be here. I can see you like this. The first time we met... ... did you remember what you said to the man who bothered me at the airplane? And he believed it. I wish I knew... ... that the man wasn't stupid. He moved from his seat because he believed that you're my fiance. He believed it. He was the one who can see that we are meant to be together. Why now? Why weren't you looking for me after you woke from your comma? You know what's worst than death? It's when you have to stay alive without any choice... ... because the only choice has gone forever! I contacted you once. - Hello? - Aletta. But I saw that you already have a new life. I've met Aletta. Yesterday she came looking for you. Mom, why didn't you tell me? There is a reason why I didn't tell you. Tiara. Arga. Aletta have been waiting for you for a year. She always hopes, you'll come back someday. Even all people think that you're dead. But Aletta is really sure that you'll come back. She knows in her heart that you're still alive. I saw that in her eyes. I feel that her love for you... ... is so much bigger than my love for you. I know that you never love me. It's about time for you... ... to come back to your true love. Why can't I love a sincere girl like you? Maybe God knows,... ... you deserve a better guy than me. Go after her, Arga. Before everything's too late. And now... ... right when I try to get you back... ... it's all too late. No. It's not too late. Al. I knew it all along that your heart belongs to Arga. - How did you know that? - I already knew that a year ago. - Mr. Sastro. - Hopefully our business went well. Here are the hard copy of your presentation materials... ... and I think you left this. - Thank you. Gotta go. Bye. - Bye. Hope you like my surprise. I took these candid with my phone. It's a special gift for you and Aletta. At that time I wanted to give you the video. But you just watched on the news that Arga passed away. I thought, that wasn't the right moment. Now God give you the second chance. Arga is here. So I'm telling you... ... don't throw away this opportunity. Arga, is this you? Is this really you? Calm down. Can you do one thing for me? This is what I want. When this plane is in the altitude of 38,000 feet... ... could you say "I love you"? Al. I don't have to wait until 38,000 feet... ... to say "I love you". I don't have to do that. I love you, Al. Cut! That's it. - Done. - Come on. Why are you guys here? That was good enough for a wedding present. - When did you come to this plane? - Both of you were disgusting. This is a plane, not some romantic park. Control yourself! - Be quiet. - What is he doing here? That is... ... that weird guy! Turns out, we can find some weirdo in a plane. - I just don't get it. - Exaggerating. Could you take a seat, please? Thanks.
