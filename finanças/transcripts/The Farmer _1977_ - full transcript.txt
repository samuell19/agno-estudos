We therefore commit their bodies to the ground. Earth to earth. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory. Next stop, Overbrook. All tickets for Overbrook. Next stop, Overbrook.

Remember, that's part of your dinner too. Now where is that dog? Now where'd that dog go? Sugar? Sugar? Is that Kylie? I can't believe it. Thank you, Lord. This is the day I've been waiting for. I can't believe it, Kylie. I didn't know you was coming home. I didn't know. Hey, you look good. Jesus. Huh, you old bastard, you look good. They don't even clean you up before they send you home. You're still bleeding. Kylie, you're home. That's all that counts. Hey, let me take a look at you. You know something? You ain’t as skinny as you used to be. That's because I didn't have to eat any of your cooking, that's why. Oh boy. Good to see you home, Kylie. That was your daddy's. He wanted me to play it when you come home because you loved it so much when you was a kid. There's no money to do anything around here, Kyle. I try, but there's no money. No money to do anything. No money. When your daddy was sick, all his money went to doctors. I didn't have any money to fix the roof. I can't get up on the roof to fix that thing. And I ain't got no money to get somebody to fix it. You see, it's just a question of money. Now that you're home, maybe between the two of us, we can get this place straightened out. Yeah, maybe we can. It's all rotten around here. Be careful, Kylie. You see, it's all falling apart. I just can't do it by myself. Careful, Kylie. Floor ain't so good around here, you know. Can't fix nothing. How's the equipment? You mean the truck? She runs when she wants to. That truck makes as much noise as a tractor. Well, I got $300 mustering out pay. We'll get the truck fixed first. Kylie, I been saving something for us. Ha ha, you old rascal. I knew you kept something up around here. Is it like you used to make it? Strong enough to move a Model A that's been sitting for a year. Say, you're falling apart here. I'll fix it for you later. Oh, come on, forget it. I've got a real good place for it. 1940, '41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeat in open battle. Their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. And placed at our disposal, great reserves of brave fighting men. The tide has turned. Nothing less than full surrender. Mr. Moore? Good morning, Kyle, I haven't seen much of you in town lately. Well I've been pretty busy. Yes, well I've, uh, I've been meaning to come out to the farm to see you. Have a chair. About this foreclosure, there's really nothing more I can do about it. You owe a lot of money. These taxes, they go way back. And I really don't see the farm doing that much better. It takes time to build a farm back. We realize that, Kyle, and we gave you time. Now when you came home with the Silver Star, the town was proud of you and it wanted to help. But that farm was losing money before your dad died. He couldn't make it pay, and neither can you. It's a different business today. Can I have one more extension? Kyle, sell it before it's too late. A one-man farm can't make money today. It just can't make money. I just need more time. One more extension. All right, I'll bring it up again with the board. Thanks. I'll be hoping to hear from you real soon, Kyle. Shit! Oh, God dammit! Gumshoe. What is it? There's been an accident down there. Come on, hurry! All right, Mister. Here, I'll, we'll get you out. Gumshoe, hurry! I'm coming, I'm coming. - Grab his legs. - Watch out for the glass. Get him outta here, Kyle. That's it. What's your name? Just let me be. Easy, easy. Come on. Lay back, that's it. Easy, easy, easy. Come on. Hey, you got a bad cut there. Now take it easy. That's it. What's your name? Johnny. Johnny O'Neal. You sure was lucky, fella. Kylie here just dragged you out in time. Where you from? Hey, what's your name? I'm Kyle Martin. This is Gumshoe. I'd be much obliged if you answer his question. In from the ci... Oh, ow. I took your gun, in case you were wondering. Yeah. Yeah, I was wondering. Lou, what happened to the change for Table Two? And get me another pitcher of beer. Okay, just a minute. Hey, Betty. Yeah? Telephone. All right. Betty! All right! Yeah. Hi, Johnny. What are you doing out there? Oh my God, you're kidding. Are you all right? You sure? I can't come. I'm working. If you're all right, I'll send Corrigan there in the morning. Johnny, I can't here anything. Hold on. Will you hold it down? Okay. Slowly, will you do it slowly? Al right. You sure you're all right? Okay. Hey, Johnny. I'll wait for you at your place. What happened to the change. How you doing, Betty? Ugh. Geez, you look like your dog got run over by a car. What do you want, Weasel? Come on, baby, be nice. Let me buy you a drink. Lou, give me two scotches and sodas. You're a good-looking broad. I can get you outta here and make you some real money. Good stuff. I mean real money. Passini's got the hots for you. Listen, punk, if that fat Passini is so hard up to get laid, why don't you take your mother outta retirement? Listen, bitch, one of these days you're gonna make a mistake, and then it's all over. And that goes for Johnny O too. Don't let the door kick you in the ass, you puke! Morning. Hey. Morning, how are you? Fine. Feel a little dizzy, but otherwise I'm okay. I saw that car of yours this morning. You're really lucky. Yeah, yeah, pretty lucky guy. Hey, you guys get up real early around here. Mm-hm. Hey. What the hell is that? The Silver Star. Now that's something. I know what that's worth. Why do you have it hanging on an old scarecrow? Trying to teach the crows to say hero. Johnny, is that you? Yeah. Oh you look awful. Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine, just a little bump on the head. Here, let me see. Let me see. Don't pamper me. You know I don't like to be pampered. I'm not pampering, I just wanna help. Let me see. Corrigan, get me my robe, will you? Sure, boss, I'll get it. Can I get you something? Yeah, make me a drink. How about some breakfast? I'm not hungry. Make it a double. Where's my Racing Form. Got it right here, Johnny. Betty, you shoulda seen that car. Damn thing's completely burned, to a crisp. He's a lucky guy. You were lucky there was someone there to pull you out. If it wasn't for that farmer, I wouldn't be here now. Look, I want you to drive down to that farm tomorrow and bring that farmer 1,500 bucks. 1,500, how come so much? I figure my life is worth at least that much. You didn't spend that much on your mother's funeral. What was that? Hey, Corrigan, let me have a pad and pencil. Sure, boss. You know, you're gonna like that farm out there. I gotta get me a place like that someday. Hey, Corrigan, he'd really look good on a farm, wouldn't he? You got those walkie-talkies for tomorrow's races? Yeah, boss, I got them. They work good too. Good. Hey, Johnny? You're not placing bets with Passini's books again, are you? And why the hell not? Oh boy, you're really asking for it. Shut that thing off. Shut that goddam radio off, will you? Sure, boss. I'm sorry. Hey, you don't have to talk to him like that. Mind your own business. You know, I wasn't gonna say anything, but last night Weasel came in and made another pitch for Passini. Did you hear what she said, about the Weasel and Passini? Yeah, I heard. So what else is new? You can take care of yourself. I'm gonna hurt that Weasel real bad. I hate him. Well tomorrow we're gonna wash Passini for a big bundle on the races. Oh, Johnny. I mean, can't you pass on Passini's action? No. You don't need it. That's it. The fifth at the Bay Meadows. I'm gonna wash that creep. I'm gonna wash him good. Looks like we got some company. Hey! I said hey. Are you Kyle Martin? Yes, ma'am. I'm Betty. Betty McCrail. Well if you're selling something, I don't think we can afford it. Oh, man, we can't afford nothing. Well, fellas, you know I really hate to disappoint you, but I ain't selling nothing. I brought you something from Johnny O. What is it? $1,500. You said 1,5007? Yeah. 1,500. ♪ One for the money, two for the show ♪ ♪ Three to get ready ♪ ♪ One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready ♪ I don't really know what to say. You got, um... I'll tell him thanks for you. I mean, I can't... Oh, that old coot of yours sure got rhythm. He looks like he's coming in jiggers. Look, lady, you delivered the mail. Why don't you get your ass off my farm? Hold on, Johnny. Come on. Yeah, Pat's Dancer, got you. Pat's Dancer. - Hey. - What? Why wouldn't you wanna work with me? All want's a booth. Do you think I can have a booth? You can have any damn thing you want, baby. You won't be sorry, I promise. God dammit. You're something else. Corrigan. Oh hi, Weasel. Where'd you get those wheels? No, Corrigan. Come on. Hey, what are you doing? Leave it alone. Keep your damn hands off that, you son of a bitch. I'll kill you. Come on. Come on, leave him alone. Eddie, I'm gonna park this one, all right? Okay, Weasel. This just won't help now, Kyle. You're gonna have to come up with the full amount. A partial payment won't do. We've got to have all of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The whole world, including the United States. Including all that we have known and cared for. Passini wants to see you, John. Passini? What for? I don't know, you know, Sam? - Nah. - I don't know. I got gas in my car. I'll find my own way over there. John, please. Passini wants to see you. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the prime minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill. This has been international news. Let's go. Hundred and 95. Hundred and 86. Like the place, Johnny? All right, we'll have it out there by Friday. All right, we'll see you real soon. Right. Okay, goodbye. All right, take this. Take care of that, huh. And make sure you get the money first. Where the hell have you guys been? Hey, it took us a long time. I been waiting her for an hour. John, it's good to see you. I'm glad you could make it. Heard about your accident. You gotta be more careful, John. How's Betty? Come on, stop the bullshit. You didn't have me picked up and brought out here in your fancy taxicab to ask me about Betty. If you gotta know, she hates your guts. Now what's on your mind? We found a couple of tickets for the races, couple of walkie-talkies in the trunk. Now what do you think that's all about, John? I don't know what you're talking about. You don't know what I'm talking about, huh? I'm talking about the $50,000 that you stole from me, Johnny! You past posted me on that race! That's getting a little too smart, John. I never past posted anything in my life. You're just a poor loser. You're the loser! You are a loser. John, I'm yelling and getting excited. I apologize. I didn't mean to do that. It's very hot today. John, if you wanted money, why didn't you come to me first? You didn't have to steal from me. Horseshit. John, have you seen our place? We own this now. Come on, let me show you around. This is your first time here. Come on. John, you don't wanna be embarrassed in front of these boys here. This is one of the most modern and efficient laundries in the country, John. Everything is automated. We have a sorting room over here. The laundry comes in on these racks. Comes over to this stainless steel washer, holds a 300-pound load. After it's washed, put into our dryer over here. Passini, you been stroking me long enough. Get to the point. The point? Push the button. That's the point, Johnny boy. You scum. You scum bastard. Wait a minute, wait a minute! I got plans for him. Sam, get the table. Doc, get the stuff. Come on, get him on the table. Get him up here. All right. All right, that's it. Strap him down. All right, come on, Sam, let's go. Just get the strap. Sam, come on, over here. Just hold onto this. Never mind! Never mind. Wake up, Johnny. Wake up, will you? Come on, hurry up! Hurry up. Johnny boy, stay right where you are. The money, where is the money, John? Come on, come on. Johnny, where is the money? You don't know where the money is, huh? Tape his mouth. Hold it, more tape. More tape, more tape. All right, take it easy. Come on. Johnny, what part of you do you think's worth 50 grand, huh? You don't know? Well I'll tell you. It's your eyes. We're gonna pop your lamps, Johnny boy. Get the acid. You better kill him. Kill him? I want this guy alive. I'm gonna make an example of you, Johnny, and anybody that cheats Frank Passini. I'm gonna have you blinded. He's always been trouble, you take his eyes and he'll still be trouble! You heard what I said! I want him blind. Besides, by the time that whore gets a hold of him, he ain't gonna be much to look at. Acid. Hold his head still. Dr. Randle, please call the operator. Dr. Randle. Dr. Randle, please call the operator. How you feeling, Johnny? Which one did it, Johnny? Can't you talk, either? I couldn't see who it was. Oh, I suppose you're gonna tell me that you didn't see what they did to Corrigan, either. So you know? Yeah, I know. Oh, Johnny, let's go to the police on this one. No. I want you to do something for me. Sure, whatever you want. I want you to go back down to that farm. To the farm? Just listen. God dammit, listen. I want you to tell that farmer to come here to the hospital, that it could mean a lotta money for him. What do you want him for? What do you want him for? He's, he's a real... Real what? He's a real farmer. Well you just tell him that. He needs the money. He'll come. Okay. Is that how you want it? That's the way I want it. You better leave the first thing in the morning. Betty? You're a good woman. You're always there when I need you. Thanks. Sure. It's okay, Johnny. Worst cow I ever seen. Come on over here, cow. I wanna apologize for what I said the other day. You didn't have to come all this way. A postcard woulda done. I didn't have the address. Is this a new tractor? Yep. You want something? Johnny's in the hospital. He's been blinded by acid that was thrown in his face. He says he needs your help, Kyle. He wants you to come to the hospital. He wants to talk to you. It could mean a lotta money for you. I don't know what he wants. He just wants to talk to you. Please. Couldn't you at least do that? He paid you pretty well for the last favor you did. I like your car. Yeah? Johnny gave it to me for my birthday. You known him long? What? I said have you known him long? We're just good friends. Dr. Park, 561. Dr. Park, 561. It's me. I got the farmer. I know. I could tell. I could smell his cigar. Betty, go powder your nose or something. I wanna talk. Sure. Hello, Farmer. How you feeling? I feel a little better. Good. You're still gonna lose your farm? Things haven't changed. Remember what you told me about your father? About not joining the farmers' co-op? Like I said, I was never much of a joiner myself. I never belonged to the outfit. I never pushed any dope. I was never a pimp or a killer. I'm just a gambler. I beat them at their own game. That's why they took my eyes. I been planning this every minute I've been here. It'll work. I don't follow you. What do you want me to do? I want you to kill those scumbags that did this to me. Hey, look, I need money bad, but I'm not looking for trouble. I'm offering you 50 grand. For that kinda money, there's always trouble. Why me? Why don't your hire a professional? You are a professional. How many guys did you kill for the Silver Star? That was war. Bullshit, war! Because your country asked you to kill some Germans, maybe farmers like yourself. Tell me. Tell me it's wrong to kill some scumbags that they'll never hang. They know every hitman in the country. You, they'll never suspect. That's why it'll be easy. If the answer is yes, come back here ready to stay for a while. I want this done quick. {man speaking on radio) No criminal will be allowed to escape. Thanks for driving me. Sure. Why don't I, uh, make us some coffee? I'd love some. Oh, what a pretty night.
