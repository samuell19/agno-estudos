Sorry, we can't come to the phone right now. If you leave a message we'll get back to you as soon as we can. Thanks. Hi, Mamie. It's Jack. We're going to leave London as planned, but we'll take a cab from the airport, so nobody has to bother to drive in and pick us up. - We need a light shop done. - Eight. A few things to have in the house, milk, eggs, bread. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Catherine wants to know if you can pick up the dry cleaning. You already own that. You own everything. We didn't get that before we left. And listen, we completely forgot about Sally's goldfish. If by some miracle they're still alive, will you feed them and change the water, and... Mom will make my move, honey. And if they're not, will you go to the store and see if you can find a couple that are sort of the same size? Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye. - One, two, three, four... - What's happening? ...five, six! Yes! Oh, no. Yay! Another hotel? What does... What does he owe you? You owe me?1,100. I haven't got it. You win. - I'm out. - This girl is rich. I want to go to sleep. Good evening, sir. Yes? Will these do? Yeah. Bring them in. My wife, I guess. Candles, champagne... Oh, honey. I'm sorry, I didn't think of this. That's all right. Only one of us had to. Is she asleep? What about your speech? I'll wing it. You sure? We have all watched, I think, with a sense of awe, the protean events which have taken place in Moscow and the Republics and the enormous changes resulting from these events. In this volatile climate, then, I must conclude that we can only speculate on the future of Soviet fleet development and deployment. I would like to thank the trustees of the Royal Naval Academy for their very kind invitation to be here with you today. He's impressed, Sally. He just can't show it. He's a professional soldier. It's his job not to be distracted. Come on. We've got to go meet Daddy. I'm impressed. - Find it on the map there? - Uh-huh. - Good. - We're right here. And when we get to the street there, we turn left... No, right. Yeah, right. - You sure? - Turn right, yes. Okay, we're going to turn right. I'm following your map. Okay, okay, all right. You mind your bottom, Paddy-boy. Move sure and fast. You told me that, didn't you? So I'm telling you again. This won't be like anything you've ever done before, little brother. Target leaving the palace now. Right. Stay awake, lads. Here they come. Okay right here? That good? Any more? Little more? Okay. There's Daddy. Go! Down! Get down! Ready! Get down! Come on! Get down. Keep her down! Get out of the car! Come on! Get out! Open the fucking door! Open it! Jack! Open it, or I'll blow it off! Come on, let's go! Go! Go! Go! Paddy? Stop! Army! Drop it! Help the boy. No, he's had it. It's all right, sweetie. I want you to stay here. Everything's going to be okay. - Stand back, please. - Stand back, ma'am. That's my husband. I'm a doctor. I'm going to treat him. Oh, Jesus, Jack! What were you thinking of? I'm going to set you down, okay? Stay with me, Jack. You hear me? Stay with me. Jack? Jack, stay with me. The feeling here today is one of outrage over this unprecedented terrorist attack on the royal family. And while no group has yet claimed credit, there is, among many here, speculation already of Irish Republican Army involvement. According to eyewitness accounts, Lord William Holmes, the Queen Mother's cousin and Minister of State for Northern Ireland, along with his wife and son, would have most certainly been killed were it not for the heroic efforts of this man, John Patrick Ryan, the American tourist who broke up the assassination attempt. An author and professor at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Ryan is a former Marine lieutenant. Wounded in the exchange of gunfire, he is listed in guarded condition at an undisclosed London hospital. This is Deborah Weston, CNN news, London. I'm sorry. It's all right. You're alive. I forgive you. Otherwise... Hey, pumpkin. I love you. I love you, too. You dignify their cowardice with your silence. They left you. They drove off without you. I'm curious as to what it is you think you owe them. If any of my mates ever drove off and left me in your hands, I'd not only feel no great sense of loyalty, I'd make sure to remind meself to kill them. Who are they, Sean? Where are they? The trip was unscheduled. How did you know Lord Holmes would be there? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, you know. I'd tear your heart out and serve it up to you with chips if I didn't know you'd enjoy it, you Fenian bastard. No. Not in all eternity. He'll not chirp a word. Not Sean Miller. And not while his brother is lying on a slab. What's the matter, Jimmy? Don't you believe it? It's the entire thing I don't believe. The royal family, Kevin? You know that only turns people against us. Look, this was totally unauthorized, and the other brigade commanders, they know that you were behind it. Fuck the bloody IRA. All these years of war, and they've got us nowhere. In its heart and soul, England is still a monarchy, and that is where we must strike, at the royals and the ruling class. You're either with us or you're against us, Jimmy-boy. Make up your mind. Oh, I'm with you. Good. That's all I wanted to hear. I'll leave you to it. Kevin... Charlie's going to drop by tonight to try to straighten things out. Be smart. Talk to him. And hold your temper. I promise. Thanks, Jimmy. Kevin. Kevin, lad, it's me, Charlie. That's me holding my temper, Jimmy-boy. Oh, God. Oh, yeah. All right. All right. Oh, yeah. - Oh, damn! - What? - I forgot. - What? Where's my bag? You're not going to make me wear a rubber, are you? You know, the church says wearing one of them's a sin, darlin'. So is this, darlin'. So, what can you tell me about... About this guy? Sean? Oh, he's a nice boy, Sean Miller. Shot a parish priest in Derry, during confession, if you can imagine. He thought the Father was informing for the British... Excuse me, Sergeant. I don't think it's in Mr. Ryan's best interests or the prosecution's to discuss matters not directly related to the events at hand. If you can confirm for me that the man in that photograph is the same man you disarmed in the square, I think we'll be through. I can. Do you have anything to add, Mr. Ryan? Yes. - The man I killed was Miller's... - Brother. - Brother. - Patrick. Not even 17, Paddy-boy. Recruited by Sean into the IRA... Again, I think we'd all be better served if we could preserve the clarity of your eventual testimony. I read it in the newspaper. I can hardly see... I'd appreciate you refraining from reading the newspapers. Not even Doonesbury? Do you have anything to add? No. - Mr. Ryan? - Yes. My name's Jeffrey Watkins, principal private secretary to Lord Holmes. It's a pleasure to meet you. - This is my wife, Catherine. - How do you do? Hello. So, Dr. Ryan, how is your patient healing? Just fine. We're looking forward to going home, though. I can imagine. May I introduce His Lordship? Oh, hello. It's my great honor to finally meet you, Dr. Ryan. Thank you. I owe you a debt of gratitude that I shall never be able to repay. Not at all. Thank you for your kind note. I'm delighted that you're here to share in the good news, Mrs. Ryan. Her Majesty's decided to invest your husband KCVO, Knight Commander of the Victorian Order. My congratulations, sir. - Thank you. - Good luck today. Sir Jack? Lady Catherine. Perhaps if I'd had more time to think about it, I would've preferred to do something else. So you're saying you didn't have time, is that it? That's correct. So you didn't. Didn't what? Think, sir. You didn't think is the point I believe you're trying to make. No, instead, you raced into a situation of which, by your own admission, you had no understanding, attacked my client, who was, in fact, another pedestrian hurrying to help. Wearing a ski mask. Shot a second man in the chest, this one taking you, can it be... After they shot me. ...three shots at point-blank range in order to fell the second victim. I used that force I deemed necessary. I should say so, and doubt very much whether anyone in this courtroom would disagree. Excuse me. I didn't make this happen, sir. No further questions. He did. Oh, My Lord, there is one more question. Are you still, Dr. Ryan, in the paid service of the Central Intelligence Agency? I should remind you that you're under oath. - No. - I beg your pardon? No. That's all. Thank you. The witness may stand down. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gentlemen, I think this might be an appropriate moment... Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you? You stuck your nose in where it didn't belong. And now you've killed my baby brother. - Hey, Daddy! - Hey, pumpkin. Hey. Wow! You guys have really grown. How are you feeling? Not so good. - Tired? - No. I have no idea what time it is. Feels like morning to me. You're telling me. Did I miss something? No. But I did. I'm pregnant. Honey! Can I watch some TV? I'm not at all tired. What? Plates. I don't have any say in this, do I? Sure, you do, honey. This is a family. Everybody's got a say. But my say's after the fact. Or am I wrong? No. You're right. Michaela really despises her little sister. Yeah? Well... Are you ready for this? It could be even worse. It could be a baby brother. Oh, no. Boys. I mean, do you refer to these fighting men as terrorists? No. We call them patriots. Jack. Boys are... Do you, in fact, deny that the Provisional Wing of the IRA was behind this assassination attempt? When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it. Thank you. That's the policy. They'll proudly say they did it. Have the IRA admitted to this? I mean, common sense, logic, some form of reason... May I at least suggest some names? Some think your efforts in America raising money for the Irish cause will be affected... Sure you can, honey. Good morning, Mr. Cooley. And to you, madam. - How is business? - Fine, thank you. I came upon this first edition at an estate auction. Can your man restore it? And when would you want this by, madam? Soon. As you can see, it's very pressing. I'm not sure. The binder may have some trouble with this. Is that so? I'll see what I can do. He's not a miracle worker, you know. No, obviously he's not, Mr. Cooley. The best you can arrange, then. - Good day, Mr. Cooley. - Good day, madam. Hello, Sean. Don't mind if I come along with you, do you? Although I disapprove of the things you've done, Sean, I can't quite bring meself to condemn you. I can't, because I understand where the hatred comes from. I more than understand it. But the present fact is that we're very near now the darkest hole in all of Great Britain, and you still won't speak to me. They're raising the bridge. We'll be here about five minutes. Understood. Mobile Three, Lymington. Open the door! Open it, or I'll kill him. - They've got the bridge keeper. - What do we do? - We open the door. - Open it! - But for Christ's sake! - But what? Wait until they kill him, then open the door? Your guns! We are unarmed. Just who the hell are you? Get them out! Get your heads down! Lay down on the bloody ground! Don't you fucking move! Didn't think we'd forget about you, did you? Honest to God. Inspector Robert Highland, this is a friend of mine. We meet at last, Mr. Highland. Tell me, what did they pay you to turn against your own people, eh? Get on with it and be on your way. Very well, if that's the way you feel about it. Come on, Cath! Have I got the tickets, or what? - I don't have them. - I don't have them. They're on the fridge. Dad... Honey, there's plenty of time. - Hello, Admiral. - Good morning, Jack. - You know Marty Cantor. - Marty. - How's the shoulder? - Not too bad. Something's come up. Can we sit down and have a chat? They were moving him to Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight when it happened. We think he's left the country. Marty, excuse me. Let's deal in what we know, and not what we don't. We know he's escaped. We know it happened in Kent, near the Channel. If he's left the country... Jack, you listening? The chances he'd come here, that he'd try, that he could come here are so remote, I have trouble even saying it. And yet your first instinct was to come all the way out here and tell me. Marty, want to excuse us a few minutes? I've got a few more weeks before school starts, but I've got to dig in and prepare a few lectures. Want to come down and look over what we got? You might turn up something we haven't. You're asking me if I want to come back. Yup. - We'll try and go next week, honey. - All right. Sorry. Sean Miller escaped. Well, what does that mean? They just wanted me to know. They thought I might be concerned. I'm not. The IRA's not stupid. They're not going to follow me all the way over here. We talked about it. They agreed. They're gone. That's it. They didn't ask you to come back to CIA? I said no. Just like that? I don't want to go back, honey. I saw them coming, and I just... I know. I can't go back to that life again, you know? Sally! Wait up, honey. I bet your cell was even better than this, the bloody Ritz in comparison. At least you always had your own toilet bowl, eh, Sean? Come on, Sean, cheer up. You've just been spared a lifetime of hell on earth. A word of gratitude might even be in order. I don't feel like resting, laying around in the sun like some complacent tourist. If we're to build an army, we've got to train like soldiers. We can't do that in Ireland. Not now. Bleeding waste of time. There's laying about, and there's laying low. There's a difference. Is there? It's Lord Holmes who should be worried about complacency. Next time, he won't be so lucky. Post him back to Whitehall in little pieces, if that's what it takes to free every Irish political prisoner. That's not who I'm thinking of. I know that, Sean, but what Ryan done can't be undone, so you should stop thinking about him. I can't. How in the world could something like this have happened? Inspector Highland picked the day, picked the decoy routes, picked the men, and still they knew. He had two children, apparently. It's tragic, tragic. SO13 have narrowed it down to 31 people who had prior knowledge of your itinerary on the day of the attack, and of Miller's transfer, five of whom are now dead. Sir, I think it might be best if we limit your appointments for the time being. I will not have my itinerary dictated to me by terrorists. Whoever this traitor is, they'd better pray to God I never find him. We know you'll do your best, Sergeant. And we don't know if we're ever coming home And we don't know if we're ever coming home Stand up, buckle up shuffle through the door Stand up, buckle up shuffle through the door Jump on out and shout Marine Corps Egesta appealed to Athens on what basis? On what grounds? Mr. Viederman? Bad time for you? Well, they said they'd be grateful, didn't they? Yeah. Fight our battle, and the rest of the world will fear and respect you. Yeah, but didn't the rest of the world fear and respect Athens already? It didn't matter. It didn't matter? Why not? Pride, sir? That's the battle they lost, the real battle. Attention on deck! Attention to orders. I have a presentation to make. For service above and beyond the call of duty of a tourist, even a Marine, we recognize Professor John Patrick Ryan with the Order of the Purple Target, and hope that he will duck next time, lest he become part of history rather than a teacher of it. - How old is he? - Ten. Plate glass window? Here we go. - Hi, guys. - Good morning, Cathy. I've got a retina at 1:00. We might have to bump it. This could take some time. Yep, let's bump it. We're all set to go. Okay, let's do it. So you just waded on in like John Wayne. Why did you do it? What were you thinking, man? I don't know. I wasn't thinking. That's it? You sound like some of my students. It just pissed me off. I couldn't just stand there and watch them shoot those people right in front of me. It was rage. Pure rage. It just made me mad. Here's hoping you never get mad at me, man. Okay, now it's my turn. She's late, Sean. - Yeah, and then what? - And then she was at our dance. Yeah? And then this guy, at the end, he... Kind of cute, isn't she? Is she? - Bye. - See ya. - Hi, Mommy. - Hi, sweetie. How are you? Let's do it. Goddamn! Highway 50. West. - Good night, Doc. - Good night. Dr. Ryan! Clear the way! Where's Sean Miller? Where's Sean Miller? This is Surgery. Yeah, Dr. Catherine Ryan, please. - Dr. Ryan, are you all right? - She's left for the day. How long? Dr. Ryan? Come on! Come on! Surgery. Yes. This is Dr. Ryan. I'd like the results on the Thompson boy's retinal scan. Hold, please. Come on, Cathy, get off the phone. - Look, Mom. - It's beautiful. Are you still holding? Yes, I'm still holding. Look, I'd like to speak with Dr. Sutton. Operator, I want to make an emergency breakthrough. The number is 555-3464. Yeah, it's a mobile phone. What do you mean, I can't? Faster, damn it! Come on, Cath. Dr. Ryan, we have the results of that retinal scan, and everything is fine. That's great. Thank you. Jesus! Hello? - Cathy. - Jack? Cath, something's happened, honey. - Is Sally with you? - Yeah. Hi, Dad! Is everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. There she is. Right. Honey, I want you to get off the highway and get to the nearest police station as quick as you can, all right? The police station? Cathy, just get off the highway right now. Steady, mate. Steady. Where are you now? I'm at Rowe Boulevard. There's a State Police barracks at Houston Street. - I'll meet you there. - Okay. Is something wrong, Mom? No. Everything's fine. It's okay. They're gone. I got it! Coming in! - Mr. Ryan? - Yeah. Your wife's okay. She sustained a concussion, but we ran a complete skull... - She's pregnant. - I know. The baby's okay. You don't have to worry... What about my daughter? Let's sit down for a moment. No. Talk to me. It's going to be a little while before we know. Maybe in the morning. Where's Sally? She's in the recovery room, honey. They're watching her. We'll know in seven or eight hours. They had to remove her spleen. She's in pretty bad shape. I'm sorry. Harry Johnson is standing by. In a few moments, he expects to have a statement from Mr. Paddy O'Neil. Mr. O’Neil is the Sinn Fein representative... Jack. Here you go. You okay? And now we go to Harry Johnson, ready to speak with Mr. Paddy O'Neil. I've come to stand vigil and to pray for the recovery of the victims of this senseless attack. Sinn Fein are outraged, as indeed are most Irish Catholics this morning at this heinous crime. Look, I want to share with Dr. Ryan, personally, our empathy and anguish, but I will wait as I feel it proper for the most appropriate time. Can you confirm or deny that funding for the IRA is... The IRA are not responsible for this attack. What you're saying is the IRA had nothing to do with this incident? No more questions. Thank you, Mr. O'Neil. She's going to be okay. Thank you. She's all right. She's all right. Ryan. Mr. Ryan. Mr. Ryan, I'd like to share with you our deep regret about... Mr. Ryan. You know the deal, Jack. Come on, you are involved. - Marty, don't tell me about the deal. - That is not good process. - I know the deal. - You are the victim of a crime. And that does not make for the best analysis even if you knew something about terrorism, which you do not. I have guys on it, guys who know something about the IRA. - Marty, I am not standing here... - This is not naval intelligence. Marty, I am not standing here with my hat in my hand! I am telling you, I want back in. Jack? Sir. - Thank God about Sally. - Thank you. Alice and I are relieved beyond words. - You manage any sleep? - Not much, sir. I'm interrupting something. You were explaining to Jack about how we'd be better off without him around here, or something along those lines. Marc Spiva, Jack Ryan. - Nice to meet you. - Tony Ferro. Hi. Alex Winter. - Jack. - Nice to meet you, Alex. Well. Rose. I have to say, you're looking better than I expected. It's an illusion, I'm afraid. Of course, it would have to be, wouldn't it? Well, it's good to see you again regardless. You, too. Look, we've carved a niche for you, and here's your night-table reading. Oh, my. "Father killed by RUC. "Belfast. 1979." This way. Over here. Good morning, sir. Cut the engine, please. Can I see some form of identification, please? - Did you see the game, then? - Yeah. It was all right. What the hell? Hey! Hey! Hey! Nobody move! Get them up! Morning. Kevin O'Donnell, longtime IRA strategist, friend of the Miller family. He was there when Timothy Miller was killed, '79. Looked after his boys, Sean and Patrick. This photo's not a year old. I think if we could find O'Donnell, we'll find Miller still standing at his side. Are you with me? Jack? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just thinking. - What about the gun? - What about it? Think it's going to turn up registered? I'm asking a question. - Son of a bitch. - What? Look... SO13 gets an anonymous tip about some bomb-like stuff on a table in an apartment. They go in, and they get some IRA bad guys, they look around, and they see there's no way anybody could have seen through the window, like the tipster said. We've got three IRA hit men at a farmhouse hit by somebody else. That's British soldiers getting out of hand, Jack. They're not above it, not after a hit on the royal family. No, no, no, no, look. We've got Brigade Commander of the IRA, Jimmy O'Reardon, checks into a cheap hotel room, ends up dead, double tap to the head. Very professional. And that was... How long after the farmhouse? Same day. Same day. What are you coming to, Jack? Jack! Where are you going? I'm just going to go throw some water on my face. Jack! Excuse me. I think one of us is in the wrong room. - I'm sorry. - That's okay. Jack! Get down! When the IRA carry out any form of campaign, they admit to it. Get down! I mean, common sense, logic... Get down! Get down! We didn't get any prints or anything like that. Listen, who are we looking for here, huh? IRA terrorists, or some ultraviolent faction of the IRA fighting the cause their way? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Jimmy O'Reardon checked into a hotel with a woman with long hair, long red hair. This is who we should be looking for. We find her, we'll find him. I saw his wife and daughter die. But she and Neddie blew it. Ryan's still alive. They're not dead, Sean! What? They survived it. I can't say it any plainer than that! It doesn't matter. The trip served its purpose. It does matter! Sean, Americans hold their breath every time a little girl falls down a pipe in the backyard, but you've shot at one with a submachine gun on her way back from school. Well, we've started the bleeding war. The Brits are tearing apart Belfast for the IRA, and their American money are denying the hits so loud, it only makes them look more guilty. The war is raging, and when it's over, we'll be the only ones left standing. Sean, I let you go for Paddy-boy, but that's it. We've got work to do, and it's not in Maryland. Hello. Yeah? How's the family, Ryan? You nearly lost them, didn't you? It's easy to get at them. You should look after your family better, you know. Are you there? Yeah. I understand your little girl's feeling better, eh? Lost her spleen, though, yeah? Pity, that. Make it mighty tough on her to fight off infection, eh, Jackie? You sick son of a bitch. It was him, wasn't it? He's never going to leave us alone. He'll never get that close to us again, honey. That's why he's making calls in the middle of the night. That's all he can do. You get him, Jack. I don't care what you have to do. Just get him. Here's to you My brave Irish laddies We'll not be broken downhearted and sad So let us drink a toast to all of our comrades Who stand for the honor and pride of our land Can I buy you a drink? No. Let me buy you one. Barney, two whiskeys. The IRA's not responsible for all this. I know that. Are you waiting for me to agree with you? I've been saying this to the press till I'm blue in the face. That's the point, isn't it? You claim responsibility for one thing, deny it for another. Nobody believes you anymore. I want to know where Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are. Let me try and understand this. You want me to sell out my fellow Irishmen to you? Is that why you came down here? You don't understand me at all. Oh, I think I do. Look, I don't give a damn what they've done, but the day that I sell out my countrymen will be the day that I put a bullet through my own head. That's it, then, huh? That's it. You know, on second thought, maybe I won't have a drink with you. Okay, then I'll go home. Have a safe trip. I'll go home and call the TV stations, give them what they want. Let them take their cameras into my daughter's hospital room. Put it on the evening news. I don't give a shit whether you did it or not, and neither will anyone else, but I will put such a stranglehold on your gun money, you'll be out in the street throwing rocks. I will fucking destroy you. I will make it my mission in life. Excuse me. Well, lads, did you hear that? Stand sideways, you're less of a target. Yes! Satellite's coming! Celts, let's go! Come on. Get inside! So... SO13 traced the weapons used in the Lord Holmes incident to an arms dealer that supplies Qaddafi. Now, when Sean Miller escaped, he was last seen in a Zodiac heading out into the Channel in a gale, which didn't make much sense until I checked on the freighters that were out there that day. Syrian registry. Known to carry arms from the Middle East to client states in the Mediterranean, including Qaddafi. So, Miller takes a slow boat to North Africa. Exactly. Now, we send our birds up over the desert, photographing, what, how many camps? One hundred and eighty-two. One hundred and eighty-two camps a day in North Africa. Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade, Action-Directe, West German Red Army Faction. But on the day that this particular ship docked in Benghazi, there's activity in only nine camps with people arriving. Now, this one we know for sure is PLO. This one's Shining Path. These seven we're not so sure about. Why? Well, we got satellites... Well, because the people in those camps know probably better than we do exactly what time the satellite's going to pass overhead. And, Marty, unless you authorize us to retask those satellites so we can get a look before they're overhead from the side, we're never going to know which camp they're at. Jack, do you have any idea how big a deal it is to retask those satellites? Yeah. Bring up camp 18 again. Tighten on the camp here. Let's look up in here. See what we can see. Show me this grouping here. No, that's nothing. Go back to the bigger picture. Let me see down here. What's that? Tighten up on that, will you? Can you enhance that, sharpen it up? Tits. I don't know. SAS could take on any one of these camps in under two minutes, kill everybody there, and be gone before the echo fades. Are you sure this is the same woman? Keep at it, then. Son of a bitch. Hi. Read it again, Daddy. "The sun did not shine. "It was too wet to play, "so we sat in the house all that cold, cold, wet day. "I sat there with Sally. We sat there, we two. "And I said, 'How I wish we had something to do. ' "Too wet to go out, too cold to play ball. "So we sat in the house. "We did nothing at all. "So all we could do was just sit, sit, sit, sit. "And we did not like it, not one little bit. "And then something went bump. " Paddy O'Neil can sleep at night. In fact, he probably enjoys the irony. She's not Irish. She's English. And this is the girl you saw in the blink of an eye in a jeep as it passed you doing 40? Yeah. What am I supposed to do here? Tell SO13 you know who she is. Tell them her name. Give them her picture. Tell them that she poses as a rare book dealer and ask them to look for her. What do you mean, what do you do? What am I supposed to do with you, Jack? You walk into a bar, half of whose customers want you dead. You walk up to the IRA's bagman, and in front of his guys, you threaten him? You're not a field man, Jack. You never were. You are an analyst. Analyze that. I am not after your job, Marty. I'm after the man who tried to kill my family. Then will you think? You tell O'Neil that you're looking for a girl. He gives you the pictures of a girl. He obliges you to get you off his back, and you believe him? I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl, Marty. Sarge? Come and look at this. Bit of a bookworm meself, not that you'd know it to look at me. What's your passion, then? Mysteries? Spy novels? Familiar with Ian Fleming, are you? This is a rare book shop. Rare books? Yeah, so they are. Can you locate the problem, or do I have to call someone else? Already have. The wiring in this whole place dates from before the war. The first war. It's what we call, in the electrical business, rare. Yes. Can you fix it? Oh, sure. I can fix it. Can you afford it? That's the question. Just fix it. Hello. He's seen it, hasn't he? I don't know. He's got it. Look. Here, what do you make of this? I... I have no idea. Damn! I have to go out now for a few minutes to deliver some books. Please keep about your repairs. I'll be here all week, guv. Don't worry. He's mine! Damn! Dinner at the White House is no problem. What is the problem? No problem, we're just running out of dates. Yes. We could do that. Move that to there, which would leave us the 14th? The 14th. Geoffrey, let's check with John Ryan about scheduling a presentation dinner at our embassy in Washington on the... 14th. The 14th. So, let's go over this again so I can get it clear. We start in Washington with the White House... Geoffrey Watkins. Oh, I beg your pardon. I'm trying to reach Mr. Titus. Is that extension 2691? No, this is 2619. I'm terribly sorry. What are you doing up? Go back to bed. I wanted to be there when she wakes up. I'll go with you, and then I'll take a cab back. Okay. Hello? Yes. Just a minute. It's for you, Sir John. Hello? Excuse me, sir. Mr. Ryan has a special celebration that evening that he can't change. He wondered if you might care to join them. Where, at his house? Yes, sir. Why not? We shot this eight days ago in Berlin. One, two, three, four Brits traveling with him. Light arms. The heavy stuff's in the cars. He's German, he's German. This boring you, Sean? Four, six altogether. Should be the same security when Holmes flies to Washington. We've got to find the moment when he's unprotected. Four days in Washington, one day in New York. Shopping. Yeah. Two Caucasians. Take a look at the one with the hat. His arms look a little pink. Sunburn. New arrival. What do you think? Same guy? That rare book dealer, Dennis Cooley, he's bald. Now, it's possible there could be a woman in some of these camps, but with her and Cooley in the same place, if that is Cooley, the odds of coincidence are dropping fast. Still, I don't know. There's no way I can be absolutely certain. Excuse me, Jack. Tell me one thing in life that is absolutely for certain. My daughter's love. What I need to hear from you is your best guess, and I think I've heard it. Haven't I? The bastards took away my book shop. They took away my books! I'm sorry, Dennis. You can't come. You haven't got the training, and this mission's going to be very messy. I can fire a gun. Sorry, Dennis. Where are you taking me, Marty? It's you who've taken us, Jack... Satellite now entering target area. ...into battle. Sir. Enlargement sector four. Airborne support approaching target area. ETA, 35 seconds. SAS team on ground. - Enlarge camp 18. - Enlarging. - Enlarge primary target. - Enlarging. That is a kill. Roger, roger. It's go, go, go. Targets have been neutralized. Airborne support approaching. Enlarge sector five. Angle sector two. Sector two. SAS team withdrawing. Keyhole is passing out of visual. It's over. Come on, honey. Jump. See? Appreciate it. Thanks. Surveillance team one, all clear. Roger that. You sure your men outside wouldn't like some coffee? No, thank you, Mrs. Ryan. They'll be just fine. Okay. And I'd to thank you, Miss Ryan, for allowing us to impose upon your homecoming. - You're... - You're a beautiful and gracious young lady. And it's my distinct pleasure to make your acquaintance. You're welcome. I thought I might make the presentation after dinner, if you agree. Oh, sure. Would you like to see it now? Geoffrey... - Oh, my. That's very nice. - It's lovely. Didn't I already give you one of those? Help yourselves. Is that your second piece of cake, my little sweetie? Where's the bathroom, Jack? - Second door on the left. - Thank you. More coffee, anyone? I'd love some. Excuse me. Here it comes. Bathroom? - Someone in there. - No, that's not it. That's the basement. Hello? Jack? Marty. Hey, Marty. What's going on? I'm sorry to interrupt your party, but I thought you'd like to know right away. SAS just made positive ID on Dennis Cooley. What about the others? Well, it was pretty messy, as it turns out. It's going to take 48 hours to verify the dental records, but they're keeping right on it. Oh, great. What? The storm just knocked out the power here to the house. I've got to light some candles. I'll light one for you, too. Okay, Marty. Thanks. Here we go. What, forget to pay your bill, Cath? Oh, Robert. Very funny. Everyone all right? - We're fine, Jack. - We like it better this way. This doesn't happen very often, Lord Holmes. Only when we have royalty over for dinner. I knew you'd understand. Something wrong? - Come with me, will you? - Oh, Mom, do I have to? If the storm had knocked out the lights, they'd be out in the boathouse, too. So? Power comes in from the street, and then branches off to here. Jesus. This is Ryan. Any DSS agent? Any DSS agent, this is Ryan. Maryland troopers? Anyone? Is anyone reading me? Anybody? Can I come back down when the lights are on? No, sweetie-pie. You've got to get some sleep. It's very late. Goddamn. Don't tell me. Quite a storm. Take your hands off me. What the hell do you think you're doing? Jack. Gun. Jack. Stay right there. Shit. Rob, over here. What's the plan? How many are coming? Where's Sean Miller? I don't know what you're talking about. Give me the gun. Five? Six? I don't know. Maybe more. I'll get the others. Don't turn on the lights. Take this. Get down in the basement quick. - Where's Cathy and Sally? - They're upstairs. - She's putting Sally to bed. - Go. What's wrong? Come on, Ryan. Show yourself. Annette, upstairs. Right. Come on, sweetie, come on. What's wrong, Mommy? Now, you've got to help me. Climb up on the stool. There's a shotgun there. Oh, God, Jack, what did you do with the shells? Go, go, go. - Get down. - Mommy! Go on. Get back. You all right? Where's Sally? - Daddy. - Sally. It's okay, honey. Come on. Honey, you've just got to be real quiet. Real quiet. Gotcha. Christ. Hold on. Come on, come on. What are you talking about? Who is off the air? DSS, state troopers, everyone. The security company... Get me Hostage Rescue at Quantico now. Robby! Open up. - Robby, it's us. - Jack? - They're outside. - Sean, cool it. It's the royal we want. We can't ransom a dead body. They're all over the place, man. Stay close to me. How were you going to get away, huh? Want to go for the other knee? Come on! Come on. Boats. Bottom of the cliff. There are ropes. Kevin! You killed him! No, Sean, no! We need Holmes alive! We're past that! Alive! Come on! Any contact? Still off the air. There he is! Stay down there. Come on, you bastards. Come on! Come on! He's alone! He's leading us away from the royal! - Turn around, Sean. - No. Turn it round, Sean! - Turn it round, Sean! - No! Sean! Turn it round! Turn it round! Forget about Ryan! Don't blow the mission now, boy! That's not my mission! You crazy bastard! Damn! Had enough to eat, honey, or do you want something else? - Some toast or... - Pancakes. There's no time for pancakes, honey. Do you want toast or toast? Toast. - Is somebody going to get that? - I'm getting it. Sally? Hello? It is. Yeah, hold on a second. - Where's your backpack? - It's Dr. Zaillian. - The amnio. - Yeah. Hello? Is it going to be okay? It's going to be fine, honey. We're just waiting to find out. Great. What do you want on your toast, honey? - Strawberry? - Strawberry. Hold on a second. Do you want to know what it is? Did he tell you? He's asking. I'm asking you. I don't know. Do you want to know? I don't know. Do you? Well, I thought I wanted to know, but now I'm not so sure. Hold on a second. We're discussing it. Me, neither. I mean, I do and I don't. He's waiting. Okay. Tell us. Okay, tell us. Thank you.
