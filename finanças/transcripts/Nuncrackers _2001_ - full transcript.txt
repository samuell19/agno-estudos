(audience clapping) - Yeah, that's where we got the money to build our TV studio. - That's right. Oh now some of you may be expecting to see Sister's little friends, Sister Marionette. Reverend Mother said she'd really appreciate it if that puppet didn't make an appearance in the Christmas program. - Ah. - Oh, I almost forgot, don't get confused if you hear us call Sister Mary Paul, Amnesia. You may have read about how she lost her memory when a crucifix fell on her head. - Yeah, but she's back to normal now. Well. (audience laughing) - And this is Father Virgil, he's our announcer for this evening. (audience clapping) - Hi folks. - Now he is also host of his own country radio show. So he's been very helpful to all of us in putting on a show together and he's Sister Mary Leo's real-life brother. - Yeah, hey where is Leo anyway? - I don't know. - Here I am. (audience laughing) I'm warming up for the ballet. - Oh I like that dress. Now you break a leg honey. - Okay. You may know that when my sister entered the convent, she planned to dedicate her life to God through the dance, but up until now Reverend Mother hasn't let her wear a tutu. (audience laughing) - Reverend Mother is very strict about the traditional habit. - But since Christmas is a special occasion, she's made an exception. - Oh not only that, tonight, Reverend Mother's good friend, star of stage, screen, and television, Mr. John Ritter will be narrating our ballet via satellite. - Well! (audience clapping) - And also tonight we have with us, the winners of our talent contest at Mount Saint Helen's. Bring 'em on out, here they are. (audience clapping) Introduce yourselves kids, go on. - John Kelly, grade 12, Sister Marie Eugene.

(audience laughing) - Sister Mary Leo is going to dance in "The Ball Breaker." (audience laughing) - Who told you that Amnesia? - Sister Robert Anne. - Mm-hmm. (audience laughing) The name of the ballet sister is "The Nutcracker." (audience laughing) - "The Nutcracker." - Good. Robert Anne I'm gonna throttle you. - (laughing) And now to narrate "The Nutcracker" please welcome via satellite, our very special guest, Mr. John Ritter, yeah! (audience clapping) - Once upon a time there was a very nice family in a very nice town. They lived in a very nice house, complete with very nice mice and a very nice cat, except when it came to the mice. Then the cat was, well, there's no other way to put it, a killer. The mice lived behind the living room wall and they never came out because of the cat. They worked there, they ate there, they slept there, they even voted there. And that's where our story begins. Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. (upbeat music) What's happening? Well, it's seems the cat is away on tour starring in her very own show so the mice are celebrating. ♪ Joy to the world the cat's away ♪ ♪ And so the mice can play ♪ ♪ The cat's a Broadway star ♪ ♪ And she has gone so far ♪ ♪ That she can't catch us here ♪ ♪ Let's all give a cheer ♪ ♪ For we both can play and sing and have no fear ♪ (mice squeaking) (audience clapping) - Every year Mayor Stahlbaum gave a lavish Christmas party for his son Fritz and his daughter Clara. (woman screaming) What the heck was that? - What happened? - I didn't mean to do it, she just tripped. - Oh, oh dear. Stop tape Sister Winifred, stop tape. - Time out, time out. - Sister Leo got her toenail. - Oh no! - Oh no, oh, oh dear Virgil, go see about her. - Oh, now we can't do our ballet. - And we practiced so hard. - And my grandmother's here. - It's not fair. - Now, now, now, now, now, just calm down, calm down. You see first we have to see if Sister Leo's okay and then we'll figure out something to do, don't you worry. Just go back and get ready for your next song please. Go on and tell Maria that it's all right. - Hey Rev, I could do it, come on. It's my big chance. (audience laughing) - Robert Anne, what we need is a sugar plum fairy, not a dancing ham. (audience laughing) - Give me a break Rev, hey, we can't disappoint those kids. Somebody's gotta be the sugar plum fairy. - Yeah that's right, somebody's gotta be, but I'll go out there before I let you go out there. - But look I've been practicing. Look I can-- - Robert, Robert, Robert Anne, in the words of my sainted mother, don't make me kill ya so close to Christmas. (audience laughing) Amnesia, would you come out here a minute. Robert and I might need some help getting Leo to the emergency room. - I'll get the car. - Good. (feet stomping) - Oh Amnesia darling, I want you to start the Secret Santa drawing. I've got to go see about Leo. - But I thought that was for later? - Later, yes, well it was darling, but I want you to do it now. - But everything will be out of order. - You see we'll fix it in the edit. That's a TV term. - Fix it in the edit? Easy for her to say. - Sorry for the delay folks. Are you all right now? Do you got it together? - We'll fix it in the edit. - Right on. All right Winifred, roll tape. - We're rolling. (feet stomping) (audience laughing) - All right, sit up straight, eyes forward, pay attention, okay this is a test, beep! (audience laughing) I'm only kidding here. I heard that this morning on the radio, go beep! Okay, now it's time for Secret Santa. Okay this is how it works. Now, each one of us got a present for a Secret Santa winner. Now before the show started, some of you received Secret Santa cards, so if you got a Secret Santa card okay, raise your card up high. Raise your card up high if you got a Secret Santa card. Okay? All right, I'm coming out there, here we go. Where are you? What? Hi, how are you? Good to see you. All right. Hi.

(audience laughing) Holiday pleasure. (audience laughing) Look at this, isn't this beautiful? - Oh yes. - Yeah, isn't that nice? It's a stick-on set of the 10 Commandments. (audience laughing) Isn't that nice? - Does it matter where I stick them on? - You can stick 'em any place you like. (audience laughing) And you know what? This is really pretty special because if there's any one of those commandments you don't like, you just peel off the one's you don't like. (audience laughing) You know I have a feeling with you we better hot glue some of 'em. (audience laughing) You like that? - Yes Sister thank you. - All right, give him a hand.

The good news is that Sister Mary Wilhelm over at the hospital has checked out Sister Leo and she's perfectly all right. She just has a bad sprain. - She's really bummed about not being able to dance tonight, but she's gonna be just fine. - Yes, Sister Amnesia, would you please go upstairs and see that Sister Julia, a child of God.

(audience clapping) See there. Thank you. I made that up myself. - Yeah. (whimsical twinkling) (fist knocking) (door opening) - Ah! Oh Mrs. Conkel, come in. - Sister the kids saw the tree in the window, can they come in and look at it? - We don't have one. - Of course, but know you have to be real quiet because we have a show going on downstairs okay? Wait till you see the tree, it's really beautiful. You're going to love it. - Come on boys. - I was thinking, maybe we could do "The Nutcracker" without the sugar plum fairy. Now what if I were to come out and do a-- Maria what's the matter? - Did you get hurt when the lights went out? - No. - Well what's wrong? - They say I ruined the ballet. - Who said that? - The other kids, but I didn't mean to do it. - Oh we know that, it was an accident. - Sister Leo told me so herself. - Then why are they making me feel bad? - Well sometimes people just say things without thinking. Then we get our feelings hurt. Sister Hubert can you go get that Christmas box I was showing you this morning? - Sure. - Thanks. Sit down Maria, I wanna tell you a little story. Now, when I was about your age we had a big party at my school right after Christmas vacation and all the kids brought their favorite Christmas presents for show and tell. But that year my dad lost his job and we couldn't afford any presents, so I didn't have anything to bring. At recess some of those kids were making fun of me and that made me feel really bad. Sister Helen, our teacher, she made them stop, but I still felt awful. The next morning Sister Helen called me aside and she gave me a wonderful present. Oh, thank you Sister.

I just have to figure out some way to do that ballet. Sister Mary Paul, you're on! - I'm coming, I'm coming. Oh I'm sorry I'm late, but the Conkel's brought the kids over to see our Christmas tree upstairs. - Who are the Conkel's? - The Conkel's, they live behind the school and they're really poor and they couldn't afford a Christmas tree so they brought the kids over to see ours. - Oh boy, can I relate to that. I was just telling Maria about the Christmas my family couldn't afford any presents. - Oh how sad. - Mm yeah, but it was a long time ago. So, you all set? - Yep. - Well all right. Ladies and gentlemen, Sister Mary Paul. (audience clapping) - Howdy! How you all doin'? - [Audience] Great! - You having a good time? - [Audience] Yeah! - Well good (laughs). Now you're probably all wondering why is she talking country all of a sudden? Well you see what happened was, when I had amnesia I forgot I was a country western singer so now what happens is sometimes I talk country and sometimes I talk normal. (audience laughing) I am so lucky to be bilingual. (audience laughing) It truly is a blessing. But you know, I was already blessed when I won that Publisher's Clearinghouse Sweepstakes. But that was only a partial blessing, 'cause I didn't get to keep the money. Yeah, you know that's sorta like when your grandma gives you a savings bond for Christmas and you're supposed to get excited, but you're not really. (audience laughing) 'Cause you can't go spend it on anything. Not for 20 years. (audience laughing) But you know, singing country music, that's a whole blessing that's just for me, oh yeah. Like when I got to sing at the Grand Ole Opry with little Jimmy Dickens and Lulu Roman (laughs). I was so excited my eyeballs switched sockets. (audience laughing) And after that people started calling me up and asking me to sing their songs for 'em. But you know what? I can't sing just anything. Reverend Mother nixed "I Got You on My Conscience, "But at Least You're Off My Back." (audience laughing) Yeah I think she took it personally. But you know now I got a country hit that's all my own that's on the charts, yeah. It's about me and my brother Will when we were kids and it was written for me by my friend, Holly John Davenport. You know her? (audience laughing) Oh she's a beauty queen. She's a beauty queen who's planning on becoming a brain surgeon. (audience laughing) So she can cut all the dirty thoughts outta people's minds. (audience laughing) You might like to meet her Christian. Gotcha! (laughs) Okay, Father Carisone, take it away.

(audience laughing) - Oh yeah, yeah, that David Canary, what a hunk huh? (audience laughing) - This is terrible. - What? - What's going on? - That was Sister Julia, child of God. - Oh. - She's at the police station. - The police station? - What did she do? Poison a cop? Is there anyone who doesn't know that Sister Julia accidentally poisoned 52 of our Sisters awhile back. (audience laughing) - No, nothing like that. - Thank God. - She just went to put some gingerbread men on the Christmas tree upstairs in the convent and she discovered that all our presents have been stolen. - Oh! Stolen? - Oh no, that means my beautiful Swiss army knife is gone. - How did you know about that? Robert Ann you were peeking. - No way. Psychic hotline. (audience laughing) - Now, well, doesn't matter now does it. All our presents were stolen. What else did she say? - She's just giving them a report. She said she'd be back soon. ♪ Here we come a waffleing ♪ ♪ Among the leaves so green ♪ ♪ Here we come a waffleing ♪ ♪ So rare to be seen ♪ - Amnesia, (audience laughing) it's wassailing. It's here we come a-wassailing. - Oops, mistake. (audience laughing) - [Both] We'll fix it in the edit. - Yes, yes, go. - Rev, what are we gonna do about our presents? - I don't think we can worry about that now, we got the show to do. - Okay. - Oh Lord deliver me. There may not be much to drink at this party, but we sure have plenty of mixed nuts. (audience laughing) You know this reminds me of the time when my mom and dad we're doing their act in Key Largo. Oh, you talk about everything going wrong that could go wrong. See they were with the circus you know? Well, there was a storm. I mean a real lollapalooza and of course nobody was gonna venture out in that so we were all stuck in our trailers and it was Christmas. Well now the same time that the circus was there you see Miss Sophie Tucker was working at a hotel there in town. Well she was supposed to be doing her act but of course there weren't any customers. That's storm was just raging like it had been directed by Mr. Cecil B. DeMille himself. Well, the hotel invited all of us over there for Christmas. I must have been about 12 I guess. Now when Sophie Tucker started telling her stories, I tell ya, I thought my mom was gonna die. Sophie says, um (clears throat), she says, "Well, you know, I thought about going to church with yas, "but the last time I was in a church "the priest says to me, 'Hey, Sophie, you can't come "'in here in that low cut dress.' "I says to him, 'Well Father, I've got a divine right.'" "And he says, 'Yes and you got "'a pretty good looking left too.'" (audience laughing) "'But you still can't come in here in that dress.'" I tell ya I don't think we ever laughed quite as much as we did that Christmas. And then later on (soft violin music) when it was time for dinner, they ushered us into this, oh, this fancy dining room. I never saw so much food. I suppose they knew my folks weren't called two tons on a tightrope for nothing. Of course that Sophie Tucker you know she was no will-o'-the-wisp either. And then after dinner we invited them all to come back over to the big top. And we put on a show, the likes of which you have never seen. ♪ P.T.

Winifred darling, stop tape. Well, that settles it. - Settles what? - Would you help me get this Julia set turned around please? Well you've just got to go on as Julia that's all. - Oh no you don't.

(audience clapping) (light music) All right Sister, shake and bake. (spoon smacking) - Hello friends. (audience laughing) And welcome to Sister Julia's festive food fantasy frolic. And you thought nuns couldn't use the F word. (audience laughing) Well let's get right down to business shall we starting with a few tips on planning your Christmas dinner party. Let us start off with a cheddar cheese wheel is always a crowd pleaser, but remember don't cut the cheese. (audience laughing) If you cut the cheese, the smell could last for what seems like an eternity. Just rip it quick and hope nobody notices the bouquet. Now, when it comes to the main course, I'm sure all of your guests will be expecting a turkey. Well why not surprise them with a wild goose? Last week I gave a couple of the Sisters a goose for lunch. And let me tell you they were thrilled. They called me and said they were so excited. Sister Anne Louise said she hadn't had a goose that good since junior high school (laughs). But friends, let's get to the real reason I am here today. Fruitcake! Yes that's right. Today we are going to make fruitcake. The Christmas gift that lasts a lifetime. And friends it's simple now. I have put together here a very basic batter. Before I add the fruit, I like to add just a smidgen of rum. But of course we want to taste our rum first to be sure it hasn't gone bad, mm, perfect. Rum should always go down smooth. Speaking of going down, I was going down to the market yesterday and I happened to spot some lovely fruit and then I said to myself, Julia why waste good fruit when nobody eats a fruitcake? So, I came right back to the convent and I found this bowl of perfectly beautiful plastic fruit. No one will ever know the difference. It does look a bit dry though doesn't it so let's give it a little drink shall we? And one for Julia. (Virgil laughing) Let's see did I put the rum in the batter yet? Oh well, better safe than sorry I always say. Now, let's just stir this up shall we. When you're stirring you always want to keep a very stiff wrist. (spoon thudding) (audience laughing) Butter fingers. Oh well, nevermind. Necessity is the mother of invention. I always knew God gave us fingers for a reason. Ah ha ha, yeah. You know, fingers were the first utensils, the cavemen used them for everything. They'd roast their meat over an open pit, then they'd tear at it with their cavemen teeth and crack the bones and suck the marrow out (laughs). Julia get a grip (hand smacking). (audience laughing) Fruitcake, we're talking about fruitcake today. (lips smacking) Mm, oh, you know this is very tasty. I don't understand how the batter can taste so good but then the fruitcake itself tastes like shit. Geez, sh, sh. Surely, surely it's time to put the fruit in. And the rum, mustn't forget the rum, no, oh ho. Ha ha. (audience laughing) You know what, I just thought of something. Do you realize that if Eve had put that apple into a fruitcake, Adam never would have touched it. (audience laughing) We would still be in paradise today. Because friends, the first fruitcake is still in existence. I'll bet you won't believe me. Well, here it is friends, the first fruitcake. (cake smacking) No wonder fruit stops make such good door cakes. Door fruit makes it, is the oven on? I'm sweating like a pig up here. Mommy needs a little pop. (audience laughing) - Yo Virgil, Virgil, you gotta finish. Reverend Mother wants to start the ballet. - I love the ballet. - Oh my Lord. Help me move this. We gotta get you outta here before Reverend Mother sees you. - Bon Appetite. (audience clapping) - And now once again, Mr. John Ritter. - "The Nutcracker" take two. If you remember I was telling you that every Christmas eve, Mayor Stahlbaum gives a lavish dinner party for his son Fritz and his daughter Clara. Soon, Clara's godfather, Herr Drosselmeyer arrives. This Christmas eve the old man has brought a very special present for Clara. It is a nutcracker. - This is my favorite present of all. - I think it's ugly. (doll cracking) Oh, okay, oh my God, all right, come one. - It's broken. - In the morning he will be perfect once more. (audience laughing) - Clara thanks her godfather as Herr Drosselmeyer goes off into the night. - You know John, I've got a song that would be perfect for the ballet. You would just love it. - Herr Drosselmeyer goes off into the night. (audience laughing) It is late and time for all to go to sleep. As the clock strikes midnight, (clock dinging) Clara sneaks back. What's this, her nutcracker has come to life. But wait, the Mouse King arrives and a terrible battle ensues. (dramatic music) Goodness, the nutcracker is a handsome prince. Since Clara doesn't have a boyfriend, she is ecstatic over having the prince. (audience laughing) - Come with me Clara and I'll take you to a wonderful land. - They arrive at the Land Of The Sweets, unfortunately the Sugarplum Fairy is not feeling well so she won't be appearing in, oh my.

It's true that Christmas can certainly drive us crazy, especially if we've forgotten what Christmas is really all about. Now I know what you're thinking. Here's that holier than though Regina about to tell us about the true meaning of Christmas. Well you're wrong. You're wrong. I get caught up in the commercial stuff just as much as you do. In fact to tell you the truth, I'm hoping for a pretty big haul this year. (audience laughing) But, let's face it. You know all the gifts and trappings don't mean much if that's all there is. That's why we need to find the deeper meaning. And I think you will be surprised when I tell you that the one person here who really understands is the irrepressible Sister Robert Anne. - Thanks Rev (laughs). - I hope you don't have any puppets up your sleeve. - Puppets, what a puppets (laughing)? - We'll talk later. (audience laughing) - Looks like it could be bad news at Christmas time. Oh, ho ho, like that one year back in Brooklyn, when Christmas meant a whole month of detention. See we couldn't afford much and my mom went out and bought this scrawny, little Christmas tree. My brother said it woulda been better had we decorated the broom. Anyway, anyway. There was this tree in front of Finkelstein's Pawn Shop that I knew would look great in our living room. (laughs) Besides, what do the Finkelstein's need with a Christmas tree, come on. (audience laughing) Well, it did look great in our living room till Mr. Finkelstein called my mom. Didn't even get a lump a coal that Christmas. But hey, you know, I'm not looking for any sympathy here, I was a tough kid, huh, I could handle it all. Yeah, well, except for the year my dad left. That was rough. It was the one time I actually tried to clean up my act. See the Sisters told me that if I could prove to them that I could change for the better, that I'd be allowed to participate in the living nativity at St. James Cathedral. Now, you gotta understand, St. James was the big time. It was like the super bowl of nativities, you know what I'm saying?

Oh Hubert, what have I done to deserve this? - Deserve what? - Well that was Julia. She's coming back over here with the police. All of our presents were stolen. I made a fool outta myself in the ballet. - You forgot to turn off the phone. - Forgot to turn off the, all right Hubert. - Oh come on Regina. So the ballet wasn't perfect.

We need new recruits. (audience laughing) - Smooth segue Hubert. Ever since we lost 52 of our Sisters to Julia's vichyssoise soup, we have been a little short handed so to speak.

Good singers. - The police said they would do what they can but they don't hold out much hope. - Hope, hope for what? - The presents. - The presents? What presents? - The Christmas presents. - You didn't know all the presents under our Christmas tree were stolen? - (laughs) No, no one stole the presents. I gave them to the Conkel's. - What? - What? - The Conkel's. You know the poor family that lives behind the school. When they came over to see our Christmas tree and the kids saw all the presents, oh they got so excited. - Amnesia, those weren't your presents to give away, how could you do that? - Well I hope they like the "Sweatin' to the Oldies" video I bought you Regina. (audience laughing) - Well I know they're gonna like that new DVD player I got Sister Robert Anne. - You got me a DVD player? - Yeah. - We gotta get those presents back. (audience laughing) Maybe she could tell 'em it's all a mistake? - She can't do that. - We'll just have to offer it up for the poor souls. - Well it looks like we're the poor souls. - But wait, you don't understand. I mean if you coulda seen those kids' faces when they saw all the presents. - That may be darling, but you still had no right to give 'em away. - Funny, that's what Mr. Conkel said too. Yeah, he said he bought a lottery ticket for Christmas and they would be just fine. Well I knew then that I had to do something. I mean those kids couldn't count on Santa Claus winning the lottery. So, I talked Mr. Conkel into taking the presents and he gave me the lottery ticket. - Great, so all we have to do now is win the lottery. - Well you know she did win the Publishers' Clearinghouse. - Oh, what time is it? Sister Winifred, could you switch the monitor to the all news channel? - Ooh, that's impossible. - Well it can't hurt to check. Put that thing out here, put it here. Just a little. It can only help. - Good evening I'm your Lambda Vega. There were four first prize winning tickets worth over $32,000 each in last night's pick five drawing. Tonight's winning Take Five numbers are 15. - 15! - 27. - 27 oh be still my heart. - 28. - 28 yes! - 14. - 14! - Oh praise! - And 10. - 10 ! ♪ Gloria hear that ♪ (people celebrating) - Who said lightening doesn't strike twice huh? - What are we gonna do with all that money? ♪ Oh we should build a brand new school ♪ ♪ We should build a brand new school ♪ ♪ It should have a swimming pool ♪ ♪ It should have a swimming pool ♪ ♪ We should buy a Cadillac ♪ ♪ Yes we need a Cadillac ♪ ♪ We should give the ticket back ♪ ♪ We should give the ticket back ♪ - Are you crazy? - She's lost her mind. - Amnesia gave them the presents. - Well that was before she knew it was a winning ticket. - But it's not as if we were gonna do something selfish with the money. - Oh well, that's different. Robert, I suppose since the Conkel's are driving that beat up old truck, you'll be giving them a ride in your new Cadillac. - Well I could. - Ah Hubert, as I recall just a few minutes ago you were the one who was so anxious to see if we'd win. - Yeah, yeah, I traded fair and square. - That's right you did. So, why should she give it back? - Because I couldn't live with myself and neither could any of you if we didn't. We should give the ticket back because it's the right thing to do. - Oh, bye bye Cadillac. - I just hate it when you're right. - Do you think they'll give the presents back? - Amnesia, I can almost guarantee it.
