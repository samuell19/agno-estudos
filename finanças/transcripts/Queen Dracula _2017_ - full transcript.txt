Do I know you? - No, but I know you. I'm a big fan of your work. - Are you now? Yes. I've been following you for quite some time. - And what is it that you think that I do? - I know you only go out at night, you wonder why you never venture out during the day. - State your business or be gone with you. - I'm a detective. I've got a case about the disappearance of small children. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? - I can't say that I do. I've been out partying all night. I'd like to go inside now. You mind if I join you? - Sure. We'll have a drink together. That sounds swell. It's really dark in here. Allow me. - Let me introduce myself. I'm Van Helsing. You heard of me? I'll make it stop. You're the last of your kind. After you, they'll be no more vampires. She's coming. - Who's coming? The queen. - Is she now? When is she coming? You're now going to die. - I'll tell you what, I'm not gonna be around when the end comes, I'll tell you that much. I dipped my hands in holy water. For I know the plans that I have for you, says the Lord. Thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11. Who wants to say grace? - Not me. Not now, not ever. I done said enough grace in this house. - What is that supposed to mean? Momma will want us to say grace. - Momma also probably wanted to live a little longer. We said our prayers every morning, noon, and night to make that happen, but now she gone. - That's out of our control. - Yes, you're right. It's not out of His. You know me. I have to have substantial proof before I believe in something. Forgive me if I'm having my doubts. - What do you call the Bible? - It's a telephone book of fortune cookie phrases. Life got you feeling hectic? Turn to Psalms and find your peace. - Don't talk like that, dad. What? You're the one that's always yelling about freedom of speech. - I believe in the freedom of speech if you're passionate about something. The thing is, you're not. You're just hurting because mom is gone and that's understandable. I feel broken too. - So do I, but mom would want us to be happy. And say our prayers. - Well then, y'all go ahead. Y'all are real passionate about that. Greetings from your friend in Transylvania, D. Yes? - My name is Jack. I'm here to see Mina. - Really? Are you sure not just pretending you're interested because you heard about the dowry? - I don't know what you're talking about. I merely heard that Mina was one of the fairest girls in all the land, as they say. I wanted to meet her. Who are you? - I'm the gatekeeper and you're not gonna pass me that easy. How'd you meet my little sister? - Friend of a friend. - Which friend? - You said something about a dowry. - You know what I'm talking about. Cut the shit. If either one of us girls gets married off, our mother left us both a prized dowry to make sure we were taken care of. - Are you available? - Maybe I'm not interested in you. - Not interested in me? - I'm not interested in men in general. - These are progressive times, aren't they? She's a very lucky woman. - Not that way 'cause I'll be sure a gold digger, but can you please get off my porch? I'm expecting a package. Who is it? - It's no one. He was just leaving. - What's his name? - Just leaving, that's what your name is. Run along now. - Why'd you have to run him off like that? He was here to see me, wasn't he? - He doesn't care about you, Mina. All he's after is some money. - How do you know? - I can tell, all right? There's a reason I'm not going out with boys anymore. Too much drama. - Maybe I wanna experience that, maybe I wanna go out in the world and have my share of the pain. - Do you really wanna get your heart broken, to get robbed of your inheritance? Why did mom have to make it a dowry? - She didn't want us to be alone. - You can't buy love. Where are you off to, dad? - Kind of fell off on something. We have to do the story. - Thought you were gonna take me to work. - I'll take you to work, Mina. Where you off to, dad? - Transylvania. - Sounds spooky. Do you know somebody who lives there? Nope. Got a postcard. - You're not gonna do a little more research before you go out? - Checked it out online, says it's a ghost town. - Then why are you going? - It's a ghost town, who sent the postcard, and why? That's a potential story in itself. I'll try and check in, but if I don't hear from you in a couple days, you know where to find me. Don't you think that's a little crazy? A little. I just need to get out of this house for a little while. - Fair enough. Enjoy yourself. You ready for work? - Yeah, I just gotta grab a few things. - Get your shit and let's go. - Can I help you find something, sir? - No. Actually, I was looking for you. - For me? - Yes. You're Mina, aren't you? - I am. Who are you? - My name is Arthur. I have traveled several hours and I was told that I could find you here. - Who told you this? - My father. He's the district manager and so he has access to all the accounts. He told me that you'd be here today. - Why? - I've got a lot of formal events coming up, but unfortunately, I don't have a date. My father really frowns upon me if I don't have someone there on my arm. - What, you want me to be somebody on your arm? - Yes, if you'd like to that is. - I haven't anything fancy to wear to these events. - If you need to go shopping, I can extend you my credit line and you can go get whatever you need. - I'm kind of in this phase where I'd like to wear a lot of black. Is that gonna be an issue? - Black is definitely an elegant color, but I was thinking something a little bit more formal. Red maybe? - Can we talk about this a bit later? Our supervisor's walking around. I don't wanna be caught not working. - My father is the district manager. - Yeah, but I'm on the clock. That doesn't make it right for me to talk while I'm on the clock. Can I get your number? I can call you after. - Sure. You have your phone on you? - No. We're not supposed to have them on the floor. - Here, why don't you plug yours in here. I'm gonna send you a text and just make sure to give me a call when you get off. Hello. This is Arthur. I hope you had a great day at work and I look forward to talking to you tonight. Call me when you get off. I can't believe that dumb bitch actually thinks I'm interested in her. Can you believe she could actually think that she would be my type? You can call me a gold digger all you want, but all I care about is that pocket change. Sorry sweetie. - Bad day at work? Oh god. What happened? Did you get fired or something? - No. - Did your favorite celebrity pass away? - No. - Were you thinking about mom? - I'm always thinking about mom. That's not why I'm crying. - Then why are you crying? - Some guy asked me out at work. I gave him my number and he's talking crap about me. - Where's this man so that I may end him? - Please don't do anything. His dad's the district manager. Please don't do anything. - I don't care if his dad's the President of the United States. He doesn't lie to my baby sister and talk shit about her. What did the asshat say? - He called me a dumb bitch. That stupid tard. Called you the dumb bitch? He's gonna be the dumb bitch when I get done with him. Right now I'm deciding what to cut off so that I can shove it up his ass so every time he sits down, he'll remember who he can't mess with. The Harker sisters are not to be trifled with. - No, we're not. Lucy, please don't do anything. - Why are you defending him? - I'm defending my job. I'd lie for you, but murder's a pretty big lie. - If you call my little sister a dumb bitch, then that's a pretty good way to get yourself killed. - I'm glad to see someone that's my bud. - Always. - What are you doing here? You get lost or something? - I got a postcard. - From who? It wasn't from me. Or me. Or me. Not me. - Who did you get a postcard from? - All it said is D. Who is D? Everybody knows D. Don't talk about the master that way. - Where is she? This one. - My name's Kat, with a K. - What do you do for a living? - Who said anything about living? Sometimes you have to die a little to really be yourself. - Careful Kat. You play with fire, you're gonna get burned. - I'm just trying to make him feel more comfortable. Do you feel welcomed here, Jonathan? You're the one. - What do you mean I'm the one? - You're the one that D wants. I don't know if I can resist myself. - Jonathan, I've been waiting for you. Boys, I've made a bit of a mess in the garage. Go see if you can put Humpty Dumpty back together again. Do you like my dress? If you don't like it, I'll change. Too little, or not enough? Don't say anything until I've shown you the bedroom. - Who are you? You can call me D. - What does that stand for? Dominatrix. It stands for anything you want it to, Jonathan. Why did you call me here? - Because I see an opportunity. - An opportunity for what? If you use my vast experience combined with your family's assets, there will be nothing to stand in our way. - My family's assets? - I understand that your wife set aside some money? - Besides that, you're only interested in money? - No, no. I'm interested in you. Aren't you interested in me? - I can't. I'm still grieving my wife. What did you do with that ring? - Don't you know? Your wife is dead. It's time for you to move on Jonathan. Don't you wanna have some fun? - I can't. She wouldn't do that to me. - Oh yes she would. A woman's fire is hard to quench beyond the grave. I guarantee if it was you and not her, your wife would be some stranger right now to forget about you. No she wouldn't. - What is it going to take for you to give yourself to me? - It's not you. - It's me. - You're not Miranda. - Oh yes I am. I look like Miranda, I smell like Miranda, I even taste like Miranda. I guess I'm Miranda. - No. - I thought you wanted to be together with me, Jonathan. - No. - I can't control myself when I'm around you, Jon. - No! - You're a hard sell. I've never had to work so hard to get somebody to want me. I hope you don't mind. I'm taking a bath. I've been so dirty. - Doesn't matter if you wash off what's on the outside. It's the heart that matters. - Well spoken, but what if I don't have a heart? I'm heartless, Jonathan. I just need some attention. - What do you mean? - Your wife, she meant to help them. What she didn't realize is she made it really difficult for them to survive. Join me and we can protect them together. - You're just trying to use them. - What am I going to do, marry one of them? - Lucy is on the fence about which way she goes. - Good to know, but I'm not on a fence. I want you. You want me? - Oh yes. Don't you want your daughters to be safe? - They already have each other. - But that's not enough. You're good my dear, but you are not enough alone. They need a maternal figure, someone they confide in. That would be you? - If you want it to be. You, let's face it, you're a little pent up. What are we gonna do about that? - What the hell do you want groupie? If you're for Mina you chicken shit, you better back the hell off. She doesn't wanna talk to you. - I'm not here for Mina. - Then what the hell are you here for? - I'm here to fix your AC unit. - Why didn't you say so? - I tried to. You're due for your yearly check-up. - You want me to show it to you, the AC unit that is? - No, I'm pretty sure I can find it. - I'm not doing anything. You want me to walk around with you? - Sure, if you want to. You know, you don't have to stay out here if you have somewhere to be. - I don't. What if I wanna watch you just in case I wanna do it next time? - You gonna remember all of this a year from now? - Hopefully by then I'll be moved on. - What do you mean? - I'm nearly 30 and I still live at home with my dad and my sister. - You know, I actually did see a statistic that said 25 % of college graduates plan on moving back in with their parents as soon as they graduate. - I'm not a college grad. My mom died when I was a senior in high school. - Sorry to hear about that. - I still miss her. I guess that's why I've been going through a phase. - What kind of phase? - The way I dress. Everybody thinks I'm a lesbian. - Aren't you? - Why are you curious? - I usually have a radar that's pretty spot on. I guess you're just giving it mixed signals. - I do that on purpose. If a guy thought I was straight, then they would never leave me alone. Poor Mina, all the attention's on her. - Is Mina your sister? Yeah. Don't get any ideas. - Mina has all the luck with the guys, huh? - They don't care about her. They just want her money. That's not all a relationship is supposed to be based off of. - What do you think a relationship should be based on? - I can't give away all of my secrets. Right now, I'm an open book. You can ask me anything. - When was the last time you... had these coils changed? They're dirty as can be. - I don't know. That's a dad question. - Is your dad here? No, he's not. - Don't go throwing any wild parties. I wasn't planning on it. - What were you planning on, having dinner? A girl's gotta eat too, right? - Every once in awhile, I do this thing called eating. Every once in awhile. Do you ever do it with somebody else? - I don't know. If my dad's not home, he can't give me his permission. - You're almost 30 and you dress like you like other girls just to scare off men? Since when do you need anybody else's permission? - Who the hell are you? Mina, this is D. She'll be staying with us for awhile. - Staying with us? For how long? Until the wedding. - I'm not getting married, dad. - But we are. How long have you known her? - She's an old friend. Even though we've been away, I've always felt like she's been by my side. You gotta be kidding me. I'm definitely not. Save the date. - Dad? - Hello Lucy. There's someone I would like you to meet. This is D. She sent the postcard. - You sent my dad a postcard? Who does that anymore? - I do. It's something nice about getting to put something in your hand. - D will be with us for awhile, until the wedding. - Mina's getting married? No, but we are. - I'm looking forward to being your mother. - You will never be my mother! Who the hell do you think you are? - I'm sorry about all of this. - It's all right. I'm fine. That child however, she needs some serious help. - You again? - Yes. It's funny how things come full circle now, isn't it? - You're a doctor? - I'm a psychiatrist. I'm here to help you sort out any problems you might be having. - That word isn't plural, doc. I don't have problems, I have a problem. - What's your problem? - I got home from a date last night. - A date? How was she? - This isn't about the date. - I need to know as much information as I can to put together a good picture of the problem. You got back from a date. How was the date? - It was fine. We clicked and had a lot of chemistry. I get home and I'm in a great mood and then I see my dad sitting in a colored recliner with that crazy woman. - How do you know she was crazy? - I just got that vibe from her. She's sitting there and I've never seen her before. Then my dad tells me they're getting married and she said she's gonna be my mom? - She's marrying your dad, isn't she? She will be your mom, legally speaking anyway. - You're missing the point. I have never seen her before. She said she's gonna be my mom! - Maybe it was love at first sight. - Maybe, but that doesn't make her my mom. - You decided to attack her. - I lost it. - You lost what? - My cool! - That doesn't seem too hard to believe, having known you before. You seem to have a short fuse. What pushed you over the edge? You were a little bit frazzled, weren't you? - She did. - Because she said that she was going to be your mother? - You're telling me that if someone came into this room that you've never seen and she says she's gonna be your mom, you wouldn't flip out? - No, I wouldn't. My parents are still together and happily married. I have a hard time empathizing with your situation. - My parents aren't divorced. My mom's dead! - Yes, they are divorced, 'til death do you part, right? What, are you gonna get angry just because I tell you the truth? Who's the gatekeeper now? - What's wrong with her? - Some people cope with things in different ways, you know, stress, duress. Your daughter's been lashing out very violently against people and she's a danger to herself and everyone else around her. We're gonna have to keep her in solitary confinement until she calms down a good bit. After that, we might be able to get her into some group therapy. - Is this really the best treatment for her? - Yes, definitely. We can't have her having another episode. As long as she's reacting violently to people, we're gonna have to keep her under close scrutiny. I promise sir, I will keep Lucy under close watch. - Thank you doctor. - Yes. - Hey, hey. At least I have someone in the cell next to me. Drives me crazy not having someone to talk to. - How long have you been here? - For too long. I just wish they would set me free, but they say I'm a danger to those around me. - What are you talking to me for? - We're neighbors. I just wanted to get to know you. What's your name? - Lucy. I love Lucy. Why are you here? - Because I'm a danger to those around me. - Are you? Good thing there's a wall here. Did you hear the master? - What? - Master speaks to me when I'm asleep. - Who is he? - Not he, she. She's all powerful. She's a ruler of the night. She commands to darkness and I pledge allegiance. You should as well. - Leave me alone. - You're in solitary confinement. You're already alone, but just because there are bars, just because there's walls, doesn't mean the master can't find you. She's right you know. Hello Mina. - Get away from me. - No need to be hostile. I'm just here for business. - What? I'm the regional manager of the store. - Don't lie. - Seriously. You and I are gonna be seeing a lot more of one another. You wanna follow me to the deli sit down area? - No, I'm not gonna talk with you. I'm gonna ask Mr. Randall about this. - You know where to find me. Mina, have a seat. Mr. Randall says you're corporate. I still don't believe you. - Think you just have a problem with authority, Mina. - I'm recording this. If you feel that you must, go right ahead. Very professional of you to cover your basis. - What do you want? I just came to talk to you about your career life here. How old are you Mina? - 18. - 18. That's great. You're already in a department, but right now, you're working part-time, little four to five hour shifts. The store manager doesn't even think that you can handle it. I can. - The store manager doesn't think that you can and I honestly don't think that you can. You're going to be 28 working here part-time. Do you know why? Because you're a problem. We don't promote problems. You're like a little kid. You're immature, you think you're good at your job. Yes. - You're not. You're a slob, you always wear your shirt un-tucked, you never wear your name tag, you're pathetic. - I'm showing the company this video. - I'm scared. Who are you going to show, who are you going to call? Do you wanna call corporate now or later? You aren't going to amount to anything at this organization. Bad day? - Just leave me alone. Want a cigarette? - Just go! - My doctor says they're bad for me, but I don't believe him. Maybe I just like living life on the edge. - Why are you talking to me? - Just making conversation, thought maybe you want somebody real to talk to. I guess I was wrong. - What do you mean? - Have a nice day. - What do you mean? - I know what's going on. I know why you can't see anything on that video you just took. I've been following your situation. Usually I don't get to say these words, but that lady who wants to marry your father, she's a vampire. - Who are you? - The name is Van. I'm a bounty hunter. This lady's been terrorizing people for quite some time. She caught my attention the other day because a former colleague called me from the mental institution, saw something particular on the closed-circuit television. A man talking to thin air, holding the door open for thin air. I looked up that poor schmuck, I followed him home and I saw her. Then I followed her here. I watched, I learned. - Is she really from corporate? - Could be, but if she's a vampire, she's probably got men under her spell. - What does she want from me? - She wants you out of her way, your sister out of the way. She doesn't want you at all. She wants your father. Use him up, he's a resource. - Use him up? - Either as a sex slave or kill him. - What about the letter? - No one will be warned. Think about it. What is a marriage? It's a holy matrimony. Vampires are evil and all religious sides need symbols to repel them. - My father hasn't been wearing his wedding ring lately. - When was the last time you saw that? - He went to Transylvania. - You see, she made him take it off. I guess that's where I'm headed. - I'm going with you. - This ain't your fight. - But it's my father and I'm not gonna sit around and let that bitch keep her fangs in him. - I thought that's what you'd say. Yes? - Is Mina home? - She's still at work. - I just checked in there and I didn't see her. - I'm sorry to hear that. I just don't understand why she'd leave someone as good looking as you hanging. - Are you her sister? - Can we quit talking about Mina? It shouldn't matter who I am. It should only matter how you feel. - How I feel? - How you feel right now. - What do you mean? - Don't you want me? - I don't even know you lady. - Does it matter? - I don't mess around with people I don't know. - We ain't gonna be messing around. We're gonna be getting straight to the point. - I'm gonna go. Can you tell Mina that I came by? - One thing about male arrival is all the blood that's pumping down there. You know, had you played your cards right, you could've been one of my love slaves. But no, you weren't interested. Fatal mistake. - Hey you. You wanna know what the master said for you to do? No. - Kill yourself. Open up your wrist and let the blood flow. - I'm a little tied up right now. Bash your head against the wall until your brains are no more. - I don't hate myself that much. Can you just leave me alone? - I would if the master would leave me alone, but she doesn't like you. She doesn't want you to interfere with her plans. What are her plans? - She's turning your father into one of her kind. - How can she be stopped? - Very clever. I'm not giving you information to tell you how to hurt my master. That's something you will just have to figure out yourself if you ever get out of here. Master wants you to die here. - I'll die when I'm good and ready. - I'll remind you every five minutes. Shut the up or I'll find a way to come over there and bash your brains against the wall. - How long have you been doing this? - What, driving? Since I was 16. - I meant bounty hunting. - I dabbled in it since I dropped out of high school. I didn't like high school too much. I didn't fit in. - I don't fit in either. - Such a lonely road. Bounty hunting's a good paycheck and all, but the more dangerous it is, then bigger paycheck. Family put up the funds for all of this. That's the Reinhart family. The queen corrupted her, killed the brother, the father, and the son. Grandfather's the one putting up all the moneys for this. Anything I need to get old queen, it's at my disposal. - What do you need to do that? - There's a wide variety of things, but the thing that works best is religious symbols, holy water, scriptures. I've got plenty of all of those. Nothing can keep them mother fuckers at a distance better than one of these. - What about me? You have another one of those? - Yup. This here's my side piece. - How is that fair? - At least you didn't get a water bottle. You can still squirt them. Keep your eyes open. What are we looking for? Something shiny. The wedding ring should glimmer if you shine a light on it. Here. - Hello pretty. Watch your step. You shouldn't play with guns. - Nice work kid. You got the ring? - Come here. It's not gonna help if you scream. Nobody can even hear you. Nobody can hear you. It's just you and me, it's just you and me here. You are very pretty, aren't you? You trying to say something to me? What's that you're trying to say? You don't think you should be here in the first place, is that it? You think that you've been wrongfully placed in here? That's not it, is it? Are you gonna be good, gonna be good? Let's hear what you have to say. What did you wanna say? Thank you. - Thank you? I haven't even done anything to you yet. - Yes you have. You know, you can ask me questions if you'd like. - I believe we're to the point where I pick you up from a mental institution without any questions. - I'm glad you trust me so much. - Do you wanna go home? - I have a problem that needs fixing and I'd really appreciate your help. - Something wrong with your AC? - No. You did a good job of that already. I want you to kill my future stepmother. - Tell me you're not serious? Shit, you are serious. I'm not sure that's really a good idea. - She's a monster. - I'm sure she can't be that bad. - You'll probably find her attractive. - What if she had short red hair and wearing a straight jacket? Those are the only kind of girls I find attractive. - Whatever. Take me home. Welcome home Mina. You've been a busy girl. Skipping out on work to go after something? Bet you feel real safe right now because you have the home field advantage. Let's change that up a bit. Welcome to my world. Why can't we just talk this through? - Turn around bitch. - What kind of way is that to talk to your mother? - You're weak, aren't you? Your little slaves are gone. My father's the only one you have left. - Yes, I am weak, but you forget one thing. I have you. - Dad, what are you doing? - He's under my spell and soon, you will be too. Don't try to fight it. It's too late for love, too late for mercy. - What made you this way? I remember I was like you a long time ago. - I was young and beautiful. It was the age of exploration. I was put into captivity. They didn't feed me enough. They only used me for my sex. I realized the only way I could survive was to exploit the ones around me. I began to suck their blood, draining their life force. Soon, their power became my power. It was a shared interest. Then, I began to change. - You're gonna be like me. Be my servant forever. - Not while I'm still breathing. - Sayonara bitch. - Dear heavenly father, we thank you for blessing you standing upon us and for this food in front of us and the love around this table.
