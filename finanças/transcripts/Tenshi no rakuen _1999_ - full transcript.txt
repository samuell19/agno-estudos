Koichi Imaizumi, Akira Suehiro Akira Kuroiwa, Hotaru Hadsuki in Children are playing. Wind blows through the trees. I hear the sound of the river. I woke up when a cat meowed, but when I looked out, no one was there. Everything was over then. Oh, Takachi's still waiting. LOOKING FOR ANGEL Wilf you come home for the holidays? I don't know yet. I've got things to do. Like what? You're even skipping classes. My part time job, for instance. People count on me. You're 20 now. You must be more responsible. All right, 1 know... What do I want to do? Where do I want to go? What am ! waiting for? Not here, somewhere else. Not him, sormebody else. To be myself, truly myself. Reiko called me today. Long time no see. Yamazaki, the director, is giving a party tomorrow. I don't want to go by myself. Will you come with me? See you at 10 p.m., Gotokuji station. Are you by yourself? Wanna come with me? Please stop... I mean it. I won't stop. Sorry, did I keep you waiting? No... Shall we go? Yeah. Sorry I made you come with me. No, it's okay. I really didn't want to go alone so I asked you. Was it okay? I've got so much time to myself anyway. What kind of party is it? I don't know. But knowing Mr. Yamazaki, it must be a weird one. I haven't seen you for a while. Yeah... How's your love life? No girl friend yet. Women are difficult... You've worked on porn video shoots once too often! It's not that, I just don't get to meet girls. Well, that's too bad. Did I keep you waiting? Welcome! Come on in. Hey, here! Here, come on! Takachi, please make it to heaven. I've fucked him 103 times already, as a matter of fact. You fucking liar. I'm coming! I'm coming! So, how did Takachi die? You're cute. Hey, don't smile. Kiss me... No kisses. Then can I kiss you here? I don't want to. Hey, this old guy has a big hard-on! Take that off. We're from the same high school. Put these on! They're from the guy you think of when you jerk off. Drink the beer. Take it off... take it off. Sorao, I love you, I love you. Let's do it again someday. Sorao, let's go. Wanna eat something with me? Sorao, let's go home! Die! Like a cat, Sorac came from nowhere to live at my place. When I met him, he said he had no place to go, So I took him home, and he just stayed. Do you have to work today? It's a fine day. Let's go out. I've got money. I have to work today. He goes out and he comes back. He became part of my daily life. Like we'd always lived together. But I knew nothing about him. Then Takachi appeared, and he started to take Sorao out. I know nothing about Takachi, either. Did I keep you waiting? Have you had lunch? Let's eat. I haven't eaten yet. Okay. Sorao, who's that woman you're living with? You mean Reiko? She's sweet. I thought she was your sister. What does she do? She writes stuff for magazines. I told her I had no place to go, and she said I could stay... ...as long as I want. Do you... like her? Oh I love her. Sorao, where are you from? Where...? It's a secret. Yes, definitely a secret. Do you have any siblings? I have a younger brother. I had an older brother too... And now, a younger one... My older brother isn't around... He passed away. You don't want to talk about him? I don't mind. I loved him... Sometimes, I think of him... And I want to talk with people who knew him, to talk about him. You liked each other. Yeah, of course. We went a lot of places together. Sorao, that pimp friend of yours is still out there. Why did he came back? He came to my show the other day, I was so glad I cried. 1 hadn't seen him for a while. He said he had enough of men, and laughed. He couldn't get over that kid, what's his name...Sorao? He said “I'm happy just being with him.” How stupid? But I loved him... Just because of these stupidities. Here's your tea. Thanks. Sorao, That guy always with you these days, who is he? Takachi. He's very sweet. Takachi, my dear, Why don't you fall in love with me? Sorao's dead. I still don't get it. He said, “From now on, I think I'll be all right” Maybe he was drunk. He jumped from here, right before my eyes. He was smiling. As he hit the ground, a truck run over him. He died right away. Of course it's a lie. His family made him go home. He'll never come back. “Dear Reiko, How are you doing?” “Sorry I disappeared so suddenly. I'm back with my parents, in Kochi,” “starting life all over again.” “My family runs a hotel. Please come with your boyfriend.” “You can stay here for free.” “Soon it's bonito season.” “I'll be waiting for you.” First time in Kochi? Yeah. My first time. It's a nice place. I'm glad we came. Yeah. There's nothing like this in Tokyo. Can I see that post card? Eisaku Hanami, what a weird name. I didn't recognize the name. Then I recognized the address. I knew it was Takachi. So he was from Kochi. Thanks. Reiko! Takachi! Long time no see! Same here! It's really far away. This is Shinpei. I brought him along. Let's go. It's quite close by. How long was the trip? 9 hours, I guess. 9, maybe more. It was quite far. Grilled bonito! Enjoy! Here it comes! It looks delicious. So, Shinpei, are you her new guy? You're not, are you? Not at all! Why are you asking me that? You don't have to deny it so strongly! But I'm not! Really! How is it? Delicious! You can't taste this in Tokyo. It was worth coming. Dad, where are the sheets? So Takachi, How's Kochi? I never knew it before I came back: It's really wonderful here. All the boys here, they look like angels. They smile like sunshine. It's wonderful. Are you getting laid? Of course I am! Do your dad and mom know... ...that you're gay? I don't know. I never told them but they must know. But they don't say anything. You know, I think... ...my dad is gay, I'm sure of it. He got married late. But he never did it with a guy. Maybe he'll never do it. You can tell that!? Of course I can. I used to be in love with him. I made love with him, in my dreams. I've come to pick you guys up! You're late! This is a friend of mine... Welcome! Look! It's the Shimanto River. Beautiful, isn't it? It certainly is. Wanna go down there? Maybe we can swim! Hurry! Hurry! Wait a sec! Takachi's quite attentive. It's amazing how people change! What are you talking about? I've got to pee. Watch yourself! Is it warm enough? It's all right. I've got a weird story to tell you... What is it? At night, friends gathered at Okotobuki's. His father brought some focal sake, and we got drunk. Everybody was drunk. Okotobuki and Takachi looked like father and son. When I was in high school, a class mate, a boy, wrote me a love letter. Well, he wasn't exactly a friend, we'd barely spoken, so... I sort of ignored him. Then, my first year of college, 1 went home for the summer, The guy killed himself... ...in the school play ground. It was midnight, he poured gasoline on himself then burnt himself. The next morning, when I went there, people had put flowers out for him. Since then, I often think of him. I imagine him, burning on the school ground. As I almost broke into tears, Takachi held me in his arms. It was raining the next morning. We had breakfast in a cafe, and talked of many unimportant things. Takachi and Reiko spoke of a boy that I'd never met. I saw him weeping a little. So, here comes the train. So long, Takachi. Thank you for everything. See you again, bye bye! Thanks a lot. Thanks for coming. So, Takachi was gay. Well, it's no surprise for me. I mean, he never got a hard-on... ...the director's getting annoyed... So, you sort of guess. But, still, you know... I kind of miss him, now that he's dead. He was weird, you see? When his scene was over, he always went to his corner... I guess he didn't quite get what he was doing. Wanna go home? Yeah. Why am I here? Why am I back here? Where did I want to go? What am I doing? It's a little past 2 am. Nobody's in the streets. I need a place to sleep. It's cold in Tokyo. Tomorrow, I'll call Reiko. Will she remember me? Recognize me, smile at me? I think I'll be all right, from now on. It's all clear for me now. Where ever I go, it's the same. There are many angels in this world. Wanna drink some more? Last night, the homophobes got me. Look, I'm all black and blue here. They took all my stuff too. I lost everything I cared for. It's been always like that. Whatever I care for, I always lose. Whatever I want, I'll never get. Whoever I love, 1 can never be with. Wherever I want to be, I can never stay. It's been always like that for me. I wonder why... I don't want to go anywhere any more. There's nowhere to go, anyway... Do you really want to make love here? Yeah... Well, it's okay with me. But be gentle, will you? Please, be really gentle. Okay. 1 always wanted people to be gentle. I always knew: the guy I meet tonight will be gentle.
