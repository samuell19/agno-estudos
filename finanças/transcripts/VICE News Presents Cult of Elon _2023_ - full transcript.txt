[ Laughter ] -Around this time, there was a lot of noise outside of the company, a lot of news articles that, "Hey, Tesla is going to go bankrupt. Elon Musk is a crazy person." It drove us to work as hard as humanly possible to prove those people wrong. -It was fear, uncertainty, doubt everywhere. We would sacrifice our own time, our own mental sanity, just to tell somebody on the Internet that they're wrong. -Elon is a genius. -Tesla is skyrocketing. -Elon Musk is now the richest person in the world. -He is so powerful that he is creating his vision of the future. And these are the people that perpetuate his vision. [ Cheers and applause ] Whether you like it or not, you are along for the ride. ♪♪ ♪♪ -Cars are freedom. It's part of the American dream. It represents the ability to go wherever you want, to take road trips, to drive across the country. For a long time, people weren't sure what was going to come after gas cars. We might have fuel-cell cars or natural gas cars. I don't think electric cars were seen as feasible. People were worried that they would be underpowered, that they could only drive for a few miles before you'd need to recharge the battery. -All of the markets for electric vehicles in the US and elsewhere all sort of originate in government policy. The first of those government policies to really start fostering an electric vehicle market was California's Zero-Emission Vehicle program. -The electric car is here. ♪♪ -EV1 is the car to be seen in this winter. -Guy behind me keeps pulling up on my bumper. I can see him saying to his wife, "What is that?" ♪♪ -The EV1 was considered primarily the first modern electric car. The reason the EV1 is no longer on the road today is because the companies behind that one and the others of that generation didn't want to keep selling them. As soon as that law was relaxed, they pulled the cars and stopped making them for years. -These are perfectly functional cars that are being taken off the road. -I love it. I'm so sad I'm not going to have it for the rest of my life. -The community was incredibly disappointed at the demise of EV1. They did funky things, like hold a funeral for a car. [ Bagpipes play ] And do 24-7 vigils and press conferences. -We are not going to just stand here. We're going to keep demanding that they build these cars again. -All kinds of things. Just trying to essentially bring attention to the story. The end of the EV1, the crushing of the cars is probably the closest we got to very dark years. I don't think anyone looked at the crushing of EV1s and thought there was a near-term future for electric cars on the road. -This was a really important moment, I think, in the build-up to Tesla's success. It really sort of started to foster this sense that this is all ready to happen. We can't trust the legacy automakers to do it. Something new has to happen. Someone else has to step into this gap. Elon Musk ended up being that person. -Elon was born in South Africa. And you see from an early age this off-the-charts intelligence. You also see this pluck, this curiosity, this ability to dispense convention and just focus on a goal. And his goal quickly becomes to save the world. His interests as a child were reading sci-fi books and comic books. And one of the things that's interesting about that category of literature is that it has a common theme -- an unlikely hero comes out of nowhere and saves the world. And that's the path that Elon found for himself. -He had always been passionate about electric vehicles. Once he made the money from PayPal, he didn't want to just "go to an island" is the way he sort of frames the other alternative. And so he plowed it into both SpaceX and Tesla, which at the time was very unusual. -What we're doing is critical to the future of NASA. We want to serve as a catalyst for accelerating the electric car revolution. -I first learned about Tesla during the EV1 vigil. A former EV1 driver came up to me on the sidewalk and told me that there were a couple guys in a garage in Northern California with a converted Lotus and that I had to go meet them basically today. [ Chuckles ] Anyone that wants to start a car company is at a minimum radically ambitious, often fairly arrogant, and has to suspend disbelief for a little while, at least to see where it goes. ♪♪ -The simplest way to explain why there haven't been startup car companies is that it's capital-intensive but low-margin. It costs something on the order of $1 billion to develop just a new car and then to tool up a factory for that. What you have is a product that enters a brutally competitive marketplace with brands that have been there for, in some cases, a century. And then, even if you do sell as many vehicles as you can produce, the margins simply aren't that good. It's really one of the most difficult businesses you can possibly get into. -Often, when Silicon Valley types go and sell their company for billions of dollars, they start a VC fund and start investing in other startups. All of these companies have sprouted up to make it easier to find things on the Internet or to connect people on social media or to get a taxi. Whereas Elon Musk is like, "I'm going to colonize Mars, and I'm going to stop climate change. And by supporting me, you can save the human race." ♪♪ -Once Elon started making some money, particularly after PayPal, it's very clear that he wanted attention, adulation, I think. He wanted to be a heroic figure. There's interviews of him, you know, as he's taking delivery of his McLaren F1 supercar. ♪♪ -There are 62 McLarens in the world and I will own one of them. There it is, gentlemen -- the fastest car in the world. -Very clearly, he talks about wanting to be on the cover of Rolling Stone. -I'd like to be on the cover of Rolling Stone. That'd be cool. [ Laughs ] -He says repeatedly that everyone told him he was crazy to start a car company when he did. Which, of course, leads to the question of, like, why was he doing it? He saw that if he could be the guy who could popularize electric vehicles, that that adulation that he clearly cared about so much, it was a good way to get that. -It feels like the people who are in this are not in it for the money or the glory. -Well, you know, there's a lot to be said for money and glory. I wouldn't say that those are unimportant. Yes, I think there's nothing wrong with wanting to make money or have a glorious outcome. [ Indistinct conversations ] -Electric vehicles have always been driven by the bottom up, by the community of enthusiasts and happy warriors. ♪♪ Tesla did not realize the original passionate community and the asset that it had. -Personally, I wake up every day just excited for the future, and this is, for the most part, due to Elon and his companies.

Yeah. -It's also very déjà vu to the early days of EVs where the gatherings were smaller, but the enthusiasm and the sensation was very similar. ♪♪ -Because Tesla is perceived as having been so successful, Tesla proved that you can do it. You can start up an EV automaker and succeed. And I think this is why the history of the company is so important to understand -- because if Tesla really, at every point on its journey, lived and died by the realities of its business, of the economics and the engineering and things like that, it wouldn't have made it. Time and time again, it required the faith that Elon Musk is constantly cultivating and leveraging to kind of keep things moving along when they could have fallen apart. ♪♪ -For the first time since the 1930s, a true systemic financial crisis is underway. -The Dow tumbled more than 500 points. -America's auto industry is running on fumes. -In 2008, Tesla was, by all accounts, about to die. Elon Musk didn't even have a house because he sold his and put the money into Tesla. -He told the public that a government loan that Tesla had applied for had essentially been approved and was going to be disbursed soon. -What Tesla has done is applied for funding to develop lower-cost mass-market vehicles. -At the time he made that announcement, Tesla hadn't even submitted the complete application for that loan program. This is really one of the first examples of Musk doing something that he's now famous for, which is announcing that funding is secured when it isn't actually. When the chips are down, Musk has learned that he can meme, you know, things into existence. He can sort of say that something has happened, create the perception that something has happened, and the world will rearrange itself to make it have happened. How is it that the perception that Tesla has created is so powerful that the facts literally don't even matter? -In the aftermath of 2008, people were really mad at the big banks. People stopped trusting traditional institutions, and I think they were looking for disruptors. And Tesla is sort of the ultimate disruptor of this really old industry. -Tesla goes public on June 29th, 2010. [ Cheering ] Now is really an opportunity for people to buy and to be a part of the story. It's very tied to Elon and who Elon is and how he does business. -When the stock went public, we were just sort of coming out of the Great Recession. It was not at all obvious that Tesla was going to be a major, major investment opportunity. -I think the community has helped keep Tesla going in darker financial times, both originally, just trying to grow the movement itself and spreading the enthusiasm.

I was in junior year of high school. I ran over to my friend Julian's house, who was my neighbor at the time. We were obsessed with Steve Jobs, and I said, "Julian, Elon Musk is the next Steve Jobs. This is going to happen. Tesla's the next company. And I know it sounds crazy, but they're going to do it, and I'm going all in." And I was so stoked. -I was out of college for about four years and I graduated with a lot of student debt. One of the things I was looking to do was generate more wealth for myself. When I started looking into investing in stocks, I came across Tesla at that point.

That's part of the mission, too. ♪♪ -Already, this investor's forum was really distinct in that they only wanted good news about Tesla. ♪♪ They were completely focused on the perception of the company and making sure that that perception was completely positive. It was really interesting to see that sort of radicalization process, and it really was based on Tesla as an investment. -So, in the early days, people were buying Tesla stock because they wanted to bet on the electric vehicle revolution. And frankly, I didn't have a cause in the world that was optimistic, that was a community, that I could rally around. [ Cheers and applause ] It became, frankly, to some degree, my religion because I believed in supporting the sustainable future more than anything else in my life. -The ability to own Tesla stock is a new incremental outgrowth of the fundamentally co-creating the success of this technology together.

Elon was seen as this modern-day rocket man. He's launching rockets into space and the Roadster felt like a rocket on land. And Elon starts to become a celebrity. -Mr. Musk. How are you? -Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion. -Thank you very much. -Elon, how's it going? Those Merlin engines are fantastic. -Oh, thank you. -Yeah. -Got an idea for an electric jet. -You do? -Yeah. -Then we'll make it work. -Elon Musk has always had this difficult relationship with the media where he wants coverage, he wants attention. He wants to be a celebrity, but only on his terms. You know, I think that, in turn, led to him really embracing social media. -This is a decade before Elon buys Twitter, and he's amassed legions of followers, and he's tweeting all the time. He is willing to throw away convention and to share exactly what he's thinking. It becomes a powerful PR tool because he can go right to the people who want to hear from him. -You had on Twitter, for the very first time, a very extensive and open social network. So, people who were agitating with one another could convene on the same hashtags. For the Tesla brand, though, it became something where people could communicate with Elon Musk.

Did all the requirements, and I was able to start Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley. What's so important about Twitter and the Tesla community really is the flat playing ground that it is. You can have 100 followers, and Elon Musk, he's going to respond to you. My relationship with Elon started through Twitter, just talking about how much I love my car, and then obviously starting this very prominent club into what it is today. I was able to score an interview with Elon by just engaging with him and his comments. So, he was making a lot of comments on who the co-founders and the non-co-founders were who played a role in the early days of Tesla. You know, might as well shoot my shot. Said, "Hey, let's document this. Let's get it on record." He said, "Sure." Well, I just wanted to take a moment and kind of step back. So, the reason we're here, right, is because of the early days of Tesla. Right? There's a lot of misinformation. -Yeah. -A lot of people just think that someone else started it, you joined later, and whatever. But obviously that's not true, so... -That is not true. And the reason people think that is because Eberhard has engaged in a nonstop campaign to try to effectively gain sole credit for Tesla for himself. And he's the worst person I have ever worked with. And that is saying something. Okay? I've worked with some real assholes. -Elon cares about the origin story because founders are the ones that get the credit, and everyone wants to be the hero of their own story. People overestimate the psychology a little bit and try to read a little too hard into it when his contribution, even early on, was significant. And I think he wants to be recognized for that. [ Cheering ] -It was just a life moment. I kind of had to pinch myself several times. But at the same time, it's not like I was seeing this guy as the richest person in the world. I had seen him as this person who was literally struggling, and then, finally, he's made it. -Probably the most important sort of signs of status in that world is if Elon mentions you on Twitter. You get mentioned by Elon once, and you're in the club. If he mentions you multiple times, then you ascend to, like, this kind of elite. They're constantly competing with each other to identify not just the topics and the stories that are going to get Elon's attention, but then, like, the takes on them, that he's going to want to either respond to or echo. -Tesla spends zero money on advertising and marketing. All these other car companies are paying huge advertising budgets to media companies, so they're really incentivized not to trash them. Tesla has none of this, like, goodwill and free press. What's very unique about Tesla is the way that their community rallied around the Internet to support the company in this grassroots way. Their products were so good that you built social capital by talking about the product. -What we know from research on social media is that you might not trust the local news, you might not trust national media, but you might trust your uncle, and you might trust your friend, or you might trust your colleague. That parasocial relationship that you build with online audiences is crucial for products or other kinds of content to circulate. ♪♪ -Twitter is a really powerful tool because it lets you have a voice and it lets you connect with people that you otherwise would have no connection with. And being able to be seen by people you look up to is incredibly powerful. The role that I've played has been to support the community, to make people smile, to give people encouragement when they're feeling down. I built a video game called "Cybertruck Simulator," and you can drive a cybertruck around on Mars. Creating the world in which I want to live includes finding people that with similar interests. It's creating the renewable Earth that we all deserve, and it's finding the people who will go with me to Mars. -So much of the Tesla culture happens on Twitter. That gives the person at home a lot of agency and a lot of connection, and it builds up that demand. -Tesla Motors today announced plans to ship its first all-electric Model S sedan in June. [ Cheers and applause ] -Yes! -Whoo! -When the Model S was released, we knew it was going to be an inflection point in the EV movement. -It gets all these amazing reviews, but it's really expensive to make, and it's really expensive to buy, and it's really difficult to scale in a way that will allow Elon to launch the Model 3, which is going to be this affordable mass-market car that makes Tesla into this automotive giant. -One, two, three! -Tesla! -Look at him go! -So, in the meantime, Elon sort of starts the hype train. -That was everything from Superchargers, talking about autopilot, and Tesla's future in the driving automation technology space. -Tesla starts doing, like, solar roofs. It starts selling home battery-backup systems. [ Applause ] It starts doing sort of all of these things in the interim to keep both the hype and the dream alive to get to the point where the Model 3 can be introduced. -He will say things that push beyond the realm of aspiration into fantasy. -We're probably only a month away from having autonomous driving, at least for highways. The Model S and Model X, at this point, can drive autonomously with greater safety than a person. Next year, for sure, we will have over a million robotaxis on the road. -Musk realized that once you have a little bit of momentum, if you pour hype onto that fire, it just burns hotter. That's essentially defined the history of the company ever since. [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ -We have an amazing product to show you tonight. I think you're going to be blown away.

It was kind of like the iPhone launch in a lot of ways. -Folks started lining up yesterday outside the store. They are anxious to put their names on the list. -Tesla took 325,000 pre-orders for the Model 3 immediately after it was announced. But it was a $1,000 refundable deposit, meaning it didn't actually have all that much money coming in. ♪♪ It was still in difficult financial straits and it still actually had to figure out how to build the cars at a reasonable cost. -They also had this incredibly compressed timeline to get it to market. We're talking about getting these really ambitious production figures, and journalists in the space sort of knew, you know, this is not very realistic. -Tesla -- the stock sinking after reporting a wider-than-expected loss entering a bear market. -This company has one thing it seems to know how to do very well -- lose money. -It just so happened that Tesla opened a new facility where I lived at the time, and I'm like, "Holy crap, I have to apply." When I came into Tesla, the biggest challenge facing the company was the Model 3 ramp. Around this time, there was a lot of noise outside of the company, a lot of news articles and sort of this thing coming up that, "Hey, Tesla is going to go bankrupt." -Do you have a price target in mind? -Well, we think the equity is worthless. So, how's zero? ♪♪ -It drove us to work as hard as humanly possible to prove those people wrong. -Wall Street had a lot of trouble understanding Tesla because they couldn't put it in a spreadsheet.

Welcome to HyperChange. This is my new show about the economy, the financial system, and the stock market. I started my YouTube channel, started documenting what I was investing in. They're taking more market share. They're building on their mission. As a whole, the company is executing and building its brand and building sales and building revenue. It all seems like a good thing. Started this kind of movement of rallying together tiny retail investors to come behind a cause and support a company and build a community that wasn't Wall Street and that didn't have to go through that traditional system. ♪♪ Tesla's entire brand image, and particularly for the community, the sense of being an underdog is a very important one. Part of what makes that work is the perception that there are bad people who are out to stop them from making the world a better place. ♪♪ -I believe Tesla first caught my eye sometime in 2015. ♪♪ I was at the time working in New York City in finance, in a family office, and it struck me as an intriguing company because it seemed to me very overvalued in the financial statements and its filings. I had in my youth been a newspaper reporter, and I was itching to write again. So, I started writing for an online publication called Seeking Alpha. It was an easy platform to get into, and I started writing articles about Tesla. I wrote the first article, and I was overwhelmed with angry comments. People didn't say, "I think you made a mistake in paragraph three if you go check the numbers there." People said, "Elon Musk is the savior of our time. He is the Tony Stark. He is the hero we've been looking for. The Earth faces an environmental apocalypse and he will save us from it. And you are standing in the way. You are standing in the way of a visionary." You begin to realize this is not finance anymore. This is something different. This is a cult. This is religion. These are true believers. ♪♪ -I have seen these people share their investment portfolios, all in Tesla. And those people are really hinging all they have on the financial success of the organization. So they will do whatever it takes to get at whatever is making the stock go down. -When I started researching Tesla, I found online a video of an event, and what he was doing was demonstrating to an audience in some auditorium battery swapping. -You have the choice of a battery pack swap, which is faster than you can fill a gas tank. -And he had a big SUV up there, and he had a Tesla Model S. And you couldn't see it happening, but they were taking the battery out of the S and putting in a replacement battery. Meanwhile, pumping gas into the SUV. And this video made it appear that you could change the battery on the Model S faster than you could fill the car with gasoline. There was never any battery swapping that happened with Teslas, but it was all a ploy to get the California Air Resources Board, which at that point, they were handing out what are called ZEV credits, zero-emission vehicle credits. And Elon Musk got to capture more of those, more subsidies from California, by claiming that his cars were capable of battery swapping. And watching that video and seeing the reaction of the crowd to Elon Musk, they were orgasmic in their pleasure when he would make these claims. -Hopefully this is what convinces people, finally, that electric cars are the future. [ Cheers and applause ] -It was like watching a religious revival. And for me, that was the moment I said, "I don't trust anything this guy is saying." -So, going into 2018, Tesla had begun manufacturing of the Model 3 the previous summer, and that was not going well. This was the infamous production hell that Musk has talked about quite a bit. -I mean, and frankly, we're going to be in production hell. [ Chuckles ] Welcome. Welcome. [ Laughter ] Welcome to production hell. Tesla was really struggling to make the Model 3, particularly at the rates and volumes that they'd been telling investors that they would. -Every single Model 3 target they've put out, they've missed. -Tesla is blowing through an insane amount of raw material and cash to make Model 3s, and production is still a nightmare. -All of us were concerned because this was the make-or-break product for Tesla. -There was so much bet on that specific product to come to fruition. If the Model 3 doesn't ship enough units per week, you go -- it's over. I can't tell you how many times I would come home and I would have a text from a family or friend that would say, "I'm hearing Tesla is going to go bankrupt. I'm hearing this and that you should sell your shares, so get out of there when you can." It's hard not to have some doubt because if you have everyone coming at you from all angles, media, friends, family saying it's going to fail, and you're out there working 14, 15, 16-hour days, as hard as you possibly can to make this thing reality -- It's extremely, extremely difficult. -This was why it was the most intense moment ever, because you had so many people, so many huge short sellers attacking Tesla, saying they weren't profitable, they weren't going to make it. -Simply put, short selling is an investor saying, "I think this company, for example, is overvalued, and I'm going to act on my conviction." They are the people that take the garbage down to the curb. And if there's a garbage company, they, in effect, alert the market, and information is what markets function on. -When a company goes bankrupt, one of the things that happens is that their stock ticker -- in Tesla's case, that's TSLA -- gets a Q at the end of it. And so, if Tesla were to go bankrupt, their stock would be listed not under TSLA but TSLAQ. And so, the short sellers and the Tesla critics started posting under this cashtag on Twitter of $TSLAQ. And it kind of coalesced into sort of a very loose, decentralized community of people who just think Tesla is overvalued and that Tesla is likely to go bankrupt at some point. -This is the period that Elon begins to think the world is against him. He says, you know, "There's all these Wall Street guys who are betting against Tesla, and it's becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy because they are going to drive Tesla's stock price down and cause the company to fail through their information campaign alone." -A lot of short sellers really emerged, I think, during the 2018 time because this company was losing a lot of money and they were trying to ramp up production and literally building a car, probably in the most expensive place on the planet. -Short sellers realized that the valuation was based on narrative and was based on a lot of expectations that were not necessarily well rooted in a good understanding of what's even possible, economically, in the car business. -People want to short Tesla because they think they're smarter than Elon Musk and can make money doing it. Betting against a company is basically having negative vibes as your full-time job. "Hope our future to go electric stops so that I can make a little profit with my bet short selling a company." -We've been short Tesla a hell of a lot longer than I ever thought I'd have to be short Tesla. [ Laughs ] -Musk released these Tesla satin short shorts online as a direct jab at short sellers of Tesla stock. -People that are betting against a company like Tesla -- they're against the world. They're not taking the care and consideration into the planet. -People in finance who, evaluating Tesla as a financial investment, were stunned that it had become a cult. It had become so irrational, and a lot of them expected it to fall to Earth. I felt like if I'm going to write about Tesla and say that it's an overvalued company, for whatever reason, I should at least have some skin in the game. That's when I first bought my first put. I always kept it a small part of my portfolio. What I failed adequately to appreciate at the time is that a cult is a powerful thing. A religious force is much more powerful than an accountant doing debits and credits. There's no consistency required, no critical thinking required, no intellectual integrity required. It's whatever Elon says because he is our God. He is our electric Jesus. [ Audience shouting ] -You go back to 2018, and Elon has promised they're going to come out with 5,000 cars a week. Well, they're not even close to half of that. And he makes a joke. He posts a picture of himself with a sign that says, "Bankwupt!" And he thought it was hilarious. The investors did not find it as funny. Once you have a publicly traded company, what comes out of your mouth can affect the stock price. ♪♪ -Ever since production started for the Model 3, the tenor of the quarterly calls started to get a little bit more tense. Tesla financial situation was not great. The manufacturing was not going well. And so, he was getting more and more tough questions on these quarterly calls. -So, I have been covering Tesla's earnings since 2016. We'll make a video after every Tesla earnings call, talking about all the analyst's questions, what I thought of the results, and this became my most popular video. What up, guys? Welcome to another episode of HyperChange. Today, I want to do a recap and analysis of Tesla's earnings call that happened this Wednesday. And eventually, one of my viewers was like, "Gali, why don't you go on the conference call and ask Elon a question, represent us, the retail shareholder. That would be so incredible." And so, then I created a tweet and I was like, "Yo, Elon, 180 people and like $20 million are vouching for me to ask a question crowdsourced by retail investors on the Tesla conference call. And Elon replies, "Okay." I totally lose my shit. I slide into my roommate's room, Lee. I'm like, "Oh, my God! Elon replied! Like, this is crazy!" -Wall Street investors start asking Elon all these difficult questions, like "Where's the Model 3?" Why aren't you shipping more cars? Are you the right person to be leading Tesla?" And this really pisses Elon off. -So, I'm listening to the call. I'm in my room. I have my questions ready, like, sweating because I'm so nervous. And then I hear Elon getting more and more pissed. -And then he goes, alright, like, screw these boneheaded questions. "Let's go to YouTube." In my head, I'm like, "Oh, my God, that's me." -And then, they, like, tap me in. -And I just start asking questions, and Elon starts having fun. -We have this incredible conversation, and it really sort of opened the door to, wait, there's a whole 'nother group of Tesla investors who don't care about this quarter tiny number. We care about all these very important, strategic, long-term questions that weren't getting asked. And finally, they were getting some light of day. -The old Wall Street analysts don't get it. From his perspective, I think he just thought that retail investors are very forward thinking. They're going to step out of the box and see, like, what's the reality? -This earnings call made people think of Enron, which was this commodities trader infamous for perpetuating the biggest financial fraud in American history, particularly this point where the CEO called an investor an asshole for asking tough questions. -The analyst wasn't an asshole. Jeff Skilling was a crook, and he ended up in prison. And for this moment where Elon Musk says, "You analysts are boring and boneheaded," I mean, it certainly rhymes if it's not identical with what happened at Enron. -I was super happy because it validated my work, that it actually mattered, that someone like Elon Musk would take it seriously. -He says it to Galileo, not to Copernicus, not to Einstein, but a guy actually named Galileo on the call. -Joining us now is our friend Galileo Russell. -Galileo Russell. -I said, "This is my moment. I'm going to work my ass off. I'm going to make videos nonstop." And that was kind of, like, the rocket fuel to take my channel to the next level and essentially make it so I could make enough money to live and do all that stuff. Literally every single dollar in profit from my YouTube channel went into Tesla stock. -Tesla's hype machine sort of -- it had become franchised at this point. It was no longer just Musk himself doing the hype. It wasn't even just one or two blogs. It had become this sort of decentralized thing. -Elon is always coming up with new ideas, new ways to do things. The process is often messy, and he doesn't hide it. And so, people often say that he's nuts, he's crazy, and they often bet against them, whether it's with their words or with their money. And a lot of times, they're wrong. [ Cheers and applause ] So in 2018, Elon is running SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, which is a company that's trying to create a computer interface between human intelligence and super-computer intelligence. He also has the Boring company, which is trying to revolutionize transportation on the planet. And there is just this media attention swirling around everything he does. [ Reporters clamoring ] -2018 is really when Elon became a household name. And this all really happened when he slid into the DMs of Grimes, the pop star, and they started dating. And they showed up together at the Met Gala, and the tabloids absolutely lost it. Elon went from being like this Tony Stark, Iron Man type engineering superstar nerd to like a regular celebrity who picks fights with people, is in all the tabloids, shit-talking his haters, generally, like, causing chaos online. -2018 was really when he started to become kind of a high-volume poster. He was getting involved in things that were sort of less obviously things that made sense for him to get involved with because he's online, because he's, you know, really using that platform to kind of keep attention on him and to build up his own celebrity. It was a natural thing. -Elon's presence was felt [Chuckles] quite largely, especially through social media. He goes to Twitter to make announcements. And that's just for everybody. It's for the people at the company. It's for people outside the company. When Elon tweeted, it became news. ♪♪ -Rescue divers in Thailand are searching for a group of children believed to have been trapped in a flooded cave network in northern Thailand. -12 young football players and their coach. -In the summer of 2018, this boys' soccer team in Thailand went hiking in a cave. The cave got flooded, and they got stuck. And it became this international media frenzy. It was all anyone was talking about. "How are these boys going to get saved?" -Elon Musk is always sort of looking for opportunities to market himself. And he proposed that his SpaceX team would be able to develop some kind of submarine that would allow the rescuers to bring these kids out of the cave. -After Elon tweets about the submarine, this rescue diver rebuffs Elon's idea. -Elon Musk was deeply wounded by this and essentially called him a pedophile on Twitter. -Shares of the electric car company Tesla fell sharply Monday after the company's CEO, Elon Musk, accused an organizer of the Thai cave rescue of being a pedophile and wrote... -One thing that people don't quite understand about the history of the Internet is how different communities have formed around this idea that there's a pedophile lurking around every corner online. So, when Musk decided to accuse the man of being a pedophile, many people were shocked and horrified. But that kind of insult is so common on the Internet. -For some folks at the company, it probably swayed their opinion for a few days. I think folks were probably, you know, kind of questioning, like, "What's going on with this? He's kind of like -- Maybe he's losing it a little bit." -Particularly with the "pedo guy" incident, there was an initial reaction of just, like, shock. For me, the shock really came, like, within 24 hours when all of a sudden, the fans got over their shock and were sort of like, "Oh, this is actually not so bad." And it kind of made me realize that, like, wow, these people will forgive anything. -I saw Elon trying to be the hero. I saw him doing what he could with the resources that he had to save lives. It was something that didn't need his attention but that was an important issue. Elon cares for all of humanity, and he definitely showed it. -I think the reason why he has so much support is that he is very visibly imperfect. I think there's a lot of people that appreciate that. They see somebody who is not polished, but they view him as very capable of big successes. ♪♪ -Unfortunately, that is going to be part of what comes with following Elon Musk is he's going to say some stuff like that that is just potentially going to rub you the wrong way. But I think when you step back and realize this is probably the greatest inventor of our time, if not ever, you kind of weigh the pros and cons. -As a sociologist, we're inundated with thinking about cults. Sociology 101 is like, what is the basis of social solidarity? The basis of social solidarity is some belief in something bigger than oneself. Are people that are invested in Tesla that fanatical, that they are expressing cult-like behavior? Probably. But when we think about this, there is a kind of religiosity in innovation itself, a belief in something to come, some kind of redemption story, a future with limitless possibility, that it enhances our lives. ♪♪ -The summer of 2018 in particular was a really, I think, a really chaotic time for Elon Musk. -Elon tweets, "Funding secured," that he was going to take Tesla private at $420 a share. -Who was providing the financing? -He's going to get some flak for that. -Billions of dollars have been made and lost, set in motion by this tweet. -And then, around that time, he also went on Joe Rogan's massive podcast and smokes weed on the show. [ Elon chuckles ] -You probably can't because of stockholders, right? ♪♪ -I mean, it's legal, right? -It's totally legal. -Okay. -There's tobacco and marijuana in there. That's all it is. -The public reaction to all of this is like, what is Elon doing? -I think Elon was really kind of pushed against a wall. He was trying to ramp Model 3 production. People said it was impossible, and he was literally doing the impossible in trying to get this car out. And I think that that was weighing on him. -Elon's behavior in 2018 was, I think, a little bit concerning if you were a shareholder. I don't really care what he tweets. I just care how he runs his company. But to be fair, at the time, I put out a video that said, "Dear Elon, like, you need to get your shit together." Elon Musk, in my opinion, you have become Tesla's biggest existential threat. But the short sellers cannot stop you from building cars, from succeeding with Tesla, from building amazing products, from changing the world. But they can remove you as CEO if you keep tweeting. And I just think you're one tweet away from really ruining Tesla. -We were all trying to really fight the traditional media because traditional media was just putting out whatever clickbait that they could throw out there. It was kind of like us against the world. During those days where he had probably very late nights, very dark moments, we were there supporting him and backing him up. Unfortunately, there's certain heights of fandom that can get really out of hand really fast. Yes, there's an aspect of the fandom that was all about the stock, but then a lot of it is just kind of celebrity fantasies. They want to be the most, like, Elon fanatic, but then that becomes who they are. It becomes their identity. The people that have those interactions are going to become people that are part of the problem. -A common criticism that one hears if, like me, you write critically about Tesla is that you are spreading what's called FUD -- fear, uncertainty, and doubt. To me, fear, uncertainty, and doubt are important elements of being a good investor. -When somebody is spreading the FUD, they would often reference the community as a cult, which is nothing more than trying to lower our standard of confidence within the community. But ultimately, it's a cult of kindness, in a sense. It's a cult of sustainable energy. It doesn't have a negative connotation. -The community really mobilized in a grassroots way to say, "I'm going to make YouTube videos, you're going to make tweets, I'm gonna make this kind of YouTube video. I'm going to do this sort of event." And we just rallied around trying to spread the good word about Tesla in a grassroots way. -I actually had a neighbor who actually was showing a video of the car autopilot taking it into a wall. But I was like, "I know that exit. It's Saratoga Avenue." So, I went there, and I reenacted and I was like, "There is no way that autopilot is going to take you into a wall." Perfect. See? It was seamless. -It was fear, uncertainty, doubt everywhere. And what we did back in those days was fight hard. We disproved, like, all of the myths, and we would go and kind of sacrifice our own time, our own mental sanity, just to tell somebody on the Internet that they're wrong. ♪♪ -At this time, Elon becomes maybe the most accessible businessman on the Internet. And it's sort of this, like, self-feeding ecosystem where Elon is talking to people on Twitter all the time, and people on Twitter are talking about Elon all the time. And he becomes just this huge topic of conversation. -All the people that did believe in them and said, "We're going to keep giving you capital. I'm going to buy public shares in the market to keep the equity price up so you can keep doing secondary offerings so we can keep this going because we believe in you, Elon." We shouldn't allow them to go bankrupt. And I'm buying shares hand over fist and investing in this company. -You have all these people out there, just saying all these negative things. -Tesla's going to get crushed. -He hasn't got a network. -He can't service the cars. -Tesla shares fell 12% overnight. -But then you have a sub segment of the population now utilizing social media with Twitter, in this case, spreading positivity. For somebody that's working there, it's gigantic. -The Internet is designed so that ideas from the fringes or from the bottom up or these decentralized nodes can have an effect on the greater conversation, especially social media. When a large group of people are creating their own memes and are part of some campaign that is bigger than themselves, it can have these lasting influences on all of the other networks that they're plugged into and sharing with. -Elon, these companies, and his Twitter fan base have evolved together. Where you really see the impact is when he's having a hard time, and you see these fans rally around him and telling him how important his mission is. The negative is that some of those fans attack people who disagree. So, it's kind of this double-edged sword. -There came a point when certain Tesla fans started to believe that if you didn't think they should get credit for everything and could do no wrong, you're a hater. The quickest way to get nasty notes in your inbox is to say anything about Tesla that was short of 100% glowing. -In July 2018, I had just returned to work. One day, one of my colleagues came into my office and said, "Hey, our boss just got a phone call from Elon Musk. And Elon Musk says that you are saying terrible things about Tesla. He's going to stop you, he's going to sue you. And unfortunately, that means that our boss is going to be sued, too." So, I told my colleague, "Okay, I don't want our boss dragged into a lawsuit. I will stop writing about Tesla, and Montana Skeptic will exit stage right from Twitter." What kind of human being -- you know, at that point, one of the richest people in the world -- wants to not only shut down somebody that's writing critically about him, but to do it in a vindictive way, to cost them their livelihood. -Among the Tesla fans and Tesla as a company, there are a lot of ways in which they feel the means justifies the ends. Elon's saving the world. Tesla's saving the world. Therefore, whatever happens, whether it's treating your employees badly or calling someone a pedophile online, it's all fine. It's all excusable. ♪♪ -This tumult of 2018 -- it was sort of a stress test for his fandom. And his fandom, by and large, stuck with him. Once you were on the other side of that, and that was the reality, all of a sudden, Musk looks more powerful than ever, because what could possibly stop him now? ♪♪ -At the end of 2018, Tesla announces that it has finally turned a profit. It started to ship the Model 3. It's finally out, and the narrative around Tesla changes, and the narrative around Elon changes. -Is the magic of Elon Musk back? -Tesla -- it reported a surprise profit. -Maybe he's a little crazy, but Tesla's finally making money. The dream is really happening. -One of the most important lessons from Tesla is that however you do it, if you are able to build a cult, it can be an incredibly powerful tool. If you can rally more people and you can create enough financial and other kinds of incentives to get more people on your side, you can really kind of drown anything out. [ Cheers and applause ] -Growing global concerns over the coronavirus. Health officials sounding the alarm about how fast it is spreading. There is some fear creeping into the markets now. -The Dow closed down by more than 3% again. -When the pandemic hit, there was sort of this initial, very brief bear market where sort of everything went down. But then very quickly after that, we sort of entered this very weird period where sort of everyone's at home, everyone's in lockdown, and everyone is trading stocks online. ♪♪ -What's with GameStop? -AMC stocks' wild ride. -What are people doing buying the stock? -What's infinity stock when it goes up that much? It's infinity money. -If it weren't for COVID to put people in front of screens, it might not have ever happened this way. -All of a sudden, we get this roaring bull market, and Tesla is like the poster boy. -Stock market for Tesla is skyrocketing. -Tesla will be added to the S&P 500. -Electric carmaker shares have already surged over 500% in the past year. -It makes me sad that so many people shorted Tesla and that they tried to tear down the company, but in some ways, damn, it made the victory sweeter. -This is the time where the whole concept of a meme stock sort of comes into being. -You are gonna be so happy you stayed with Bob Sugar because I am a fucking terminator. -A meme stock is a kind of stock that a group of people get behind, not because they think they're going to make money, but because they think that there's some kind of social or political message they can send by purchasing it. -I bought at 40 bucks. GameStop to the moon. -[ Laughs ] -The way that Elon seems to have fun is through these moments that expose the corruption or the fissures in some of our most important institutions. So, as the phenomenon started to gain steam, Elon Musk encouraged people to go with this and use GameStop in order to expose a bunch of these short sellers and have this really big impact on the economy. ♪♪ -Social media became a tremendous and effective vehicle for retail investors who did not know each other to coalesce and take joint action so they could jointly run up the price of a stock without knowing anything about the company. And none of them had the first inkling about the fundamentals of these companies. ♪♪ -So, when Tesla started to really succeed and I was like, "Okay, I'm up triple, I'm up quadruple, I'm up quintuple," it was really exciting and felt good and sort of changed my financial situation for my own life. My big thing is, like, Tesla's fucking succeeding. I drive down the road and I see Teslas everywhere and every single one gives me a smile. That's the part to me that I'm like, "Fuck yeah, we won," and, like, really makes me happy. -Tesla and its surging stock price have made Elon Musk the new richest person in the world. He's worth more than $185 billion. -In 2018, 2019, through those really dark days, we had no idea it was going to go 10X, 15X. That's just a joke. To be able to watch the stock literally almost go 10X was kind of a pat on the back, but, really, we already knew that. That's why we were all doing this. -When the stock price exploded in 2020, for me, it was like, "Well, I knew this was going to happen." It was a very proud time for the community to be recognized globally. -And so, you started to see, like, young people retire on their Tesla stock and, like, tweet about it. -The fact that there's a term like "Teslanaires" [Chuckles] says lots about how the growth of their stock changed the lives of certain people that would never have seen that kind of wealth. -It really felt like we won, and now it was just a matter of seeing how far we could take this thing. -So, how much money did you make? -I'm not going to tell you.

It was a huge risk that I took at that time, and it felt like the risk paid off. ♪♪ Welcome, everybody. The last few days have been extremely eventful in the Tesla world, as I'm sure you know... Being invested in the company allowed me to purchase my first house. It allowed me to purchase our investment properties. It's allowed us to build sort of a framework where my wife and I can do sort of whatever we want. I feel like I'm the luckiest person in the world because who am I that I got a chance to have this sort of freedom because of this investment in the most, like, weird company that's ever existed. -My only regret was, like, "Well, I should have bought more, right?" But it is okay. It is what it is. There's been a huge influx in people that are only interested in the company for the money, for the potential gains, for the day trading. That to me, that's not why I'm there. -Tesla has matured into a real car company. It's selling way more cars than ever. It's still profitable. But Tesla's high stock price is more tied to the futuristic dream of Tesla, where it's not just a car company, it's a self-driving car company. It sells solar energy, battery storage, and it really redefines the energy paradigm in the entire world. -By 2020, I was no longer expecting Tesla's stock to be based on anything related to actual EVs or sales or any other business fundamentals. [ Laughs ] So, I was pretty properly indoctrinated to how wild that ride had become by then. -Tesla is just the ultimate meme stock, but it's nonsense. It's an automobile manufacturer. It's in an industry that is capital intensive, that is low margin, that is highly competitive, and all those things will remain true about it. -So, how much money did you lose? -I haven't totaled it up exactly. I would guess it's somewhere between $200,000 and $300,000. The people propping up Tesla, they fall into two camps -- the very cynical and the very deluded. I say they're deluded. I say this is not a new paradigm. Time will tell. ♪♪ -Elon Musk has been obsessed with Twitter for a decade. He used Twitter to build this huge following of superfans who do his bidding. And now he owns the whole thing. -Can't help it. Let that sink in. -It's a Twitter bloodbath. Nearly 4,000 fired in one fell swoop. -Many Twitter staff woke up locked out of their work laptops, finding out by e-mail that they no longer have a job. -Twitter is where he creates his perceptions. It's his most powerful tool in his most important work. And so, it makes sense that he'd want to sort of vertically integrate his operations into that. -When I first heard Elon wanted to buy Twitter, I was surprised. But the more I thought about it, it made me extremely excited as a Twitter user because Elon Musk is, like, the biggest Twitter user. He knows firsthand the problem with the platform. -We've been trained to think that people with a lot of money have intentions that are not necessarily for the people. They're trying to achieve something for themselves. From the perspective of an Elon Musk, I believe that he has a track record that shows that he is doing things because he feels like they're right for people and for humanity. He wants to ensure there is free speech, a platform where people can share ideas freely. -Immediately after Musk took over, hate-filled tweets increased substantially. -Elon Musk is the very opposite of a First Amendment or free-speech hero. He professes to believe in it in the abstract, but when he is criticized, his opponents must be shouted down, shut down, and punished. -So, there's this old saying -- "Politics is downstream from culture." And to that, I would add that culture is downstream from infrastructure. The way that we are able to communicate with each other is very important for the kinds of issues that we take up as a public and decide to solve. I think he originally wanted to buy Twitter because of the social and political impact that he could have if he owned this platform. If he owned it, he could shape culture wars to come. He could shape public conversation, and he could have an influence on political agendas. And so, Elon is at a distinct advantage being at the helm of that, rather than being on the sidelines and watching someone else have that kind of power. -Elon Musk has signed up for his biggest challenge yet, and that's because Twitter is this marketplace of ideas, and it's this place that makes almost all of its money through advertising. Advertisers don't want to put their products up for sale next to Nazis and hate speech. -I think what it shows, really, is that he has become so isolated and so wealthy and just so convinced of his own ability to turn anything into a success, that he was incredibly sort of thoughtless and impulsive about how he went about this thing.

Today, we're going to talk -- The real good thing about the Tesla community is it's expanding. I think it's one of the fastest-growing "cults," you could call it, or people who believe something in the world. And it's all these people who are just on board with the "why." Like, we need to go sustainable. We need to electrify the world. Tesla's just a piece of that. So, I hope it inspires more of these movements.

[ Laughter ] -I love you, too. -You're awesome. -Yeah, I think it misses a lot of nuance. What gets lost is the fact that it's a very strange, unique, weird company that operates like no other company, and a time that's like no other time in the world. -When you believe in nothing, you'll believe in anything. Elon Musk is an illustration of that. He is a secular religion for a lot of people because so many currents converge with him. The idea that we need to save the earth. He is turning his back on Wall Street's stolid boringness. I suppose we need something to believe in. But when it causes you to suspend critical thinking, when it causes you to embrace dangerous fantasies, it's not a good thing. -I think when you look at Elon's fan base and Elon's success, there is this bit of caution that's important because when you're surrounded by people who agree with you, want to impress you, fear you, sometimes you get too far removed from the truth as it needs to be told. ♪♪ -I think the examples of Tesla and of SpaceX has served a really aspirational role. Some of the polarization that we're seeing generally in our society is led by not just Elon, but people like that. They sort of go out there and behave in a way that also make people look at it and go, Oh, that's the way to succeed. I got to do more of that.
