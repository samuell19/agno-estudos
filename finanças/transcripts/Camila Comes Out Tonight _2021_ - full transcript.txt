Let's go, Cami! ﻿- Let's go! - Play it! ﻿Come on, come on! ﻿- Hold this. - It's all right. ﻿- Let's go. - There you go. ﻿- Are you okay? - Yea. ﻿Caution. ready ﻿Your back. ﻿Throw the backpack. ﻿- Careful. - Caution. ﻿- Ready. - Come on. ﻿I hate the police. ﻿I fell, darling. ﻿Do you have money? ﻿It's 20 pesos each. ﻿- Here. - Take it. ﻿- Can you owe me 10? - Sorry. Yea. I will pay. ﻿You are terrible. ﻿That was intense, wasn't it? ﻿- Yes. - They appeared out of nowhere. ﻿Cops always come out of nowhere. ﻿There was a moment when I ran so hard I almost threw up. ﻿How exaggerated. ﻿Thanks. ﻿We light it later. Let's go. ﻿I had never come here before. ﻿We came with the school. ﻿Surely on the day you were playing Counter Strike and didn't come. ﻿Yes, maybe. ﻿I kissed Valen here. ﻿Behind an embalmed fox. ﻿I remember he looked at me with glazed eyes. ﻿Do you like to kiss with your eyes open? ﻿It's not so interesting to see dead things. ﻿You love being ignorant. It's unbelievable. ﻿I support you, Lolo. ﻿It was the imperialists who invented museums. ﻿See, man? Listen to Cam. ﻿I never come to these places because of the imperialists. ﻿What a face. ﻿Damiana, the Aché girl, was shown here. ﻿She was captured by colonists in the Paraguayan jungle at age four. ﻿It was the subject of racial studies, ﻿something that was later considered an aberration. ﻿She was very young and at 14 years old, being a servant to a family, ﻿developed a strong sexual instinct ﻿and for that she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. ﻿She died a few months later. ﻿Her body was used for scientific studies ﻿until a few years ago this museum sent her back to her land ﻿so that she could have a dignified burial. ﻿Do we continue in this section? ﻿accompany me. ﻿CAMILA COMES OUT TONIGHT ﻿The curtains... ﻿And you? ﻿' I what? ' ﻿I already told you not to answer me with another question. ﻿Won't you open your bags? ﻿I don't understand why we have to share a room when grandma's is empty. ﻿Will she die? ﻿Eat ﻿No. ﻿Grandma will come back at some point. ﻿And the service room will come back too? ﻿Cami said pneumonia is very dangerous for old ladies. ﻿Didn't you bring coke? ﻿No, your sister doesn't like it. ﻿They're cold. ﻿Martina, what's wrong? ﻿What do you have? ﻿I know it's a big change, but the optics are a mess. ﻿Who will take care of her besides me? ﻿Shall we live here? ﻿I don't know. ﻿- You have to sign this. - Yea. ﻿Here are the lady's belongings. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Look. ﻿Here it is... ﻿Subjects, ﻿schedules, classrooms ﻿and also a document I need your mother to sign. ﻿Bring it as soon as possible, please. ﻿It's going to be all right. ﻿Don't worry, Vanina. ﻿Camila. ﻿Camila... They chose a beautiful neighborhood. ﻿It's not the frenetic, wild Buenos Aires they show on TV, so... ﻿They won't have any big problems. ﻿I just wanted to tell you something about the uniform. ﻿They're a little strict here. ﻿I'm on your side, I think like you, but... ﻿The school does not promote political ideologies ﻿of any kind. ﻿So I'm going to ask you to... ﻿Take it off. ﻿You can keep it and use it outside. ﻿It's not that serious. ﻿Welcome. ﻿Hello. ﻿- Hello. - Hello. ﻿Hello. ﻿We wanted to meet you. ﻿Why did you change schools? ﻿Because of my mother's work. ﻿What does she do? ﻿She is a psychologist ﻿but she doesn't practice anymore. ﻿Are your parents separated? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Mine too. ﻿Let me see. ﻿We are together in math. ﻿Are you ok? ﻿I think so. ﻿What do you have there? ﻿Are you a feminist? It's my business. Enough, girls. Leave her alone. ﻿You should wear a little more makeup. ﻿Glad you're here, right? ﻿Hi ﻿Lourdes. ﻿Camila. ﻿Are you adapting? ﻿I think so. ﻿Are you from the countryside? Because you doesn't have much of an accent. ﻿I don't if La Plata counts as ... ﻿countryside. ﻿If I say it is, I'll see you as a disgusting redneck, won't I? ﻿Come on, don't piss me off... ﻿Franco, please stop bothering me. ﻿You all like.. ﻿You think because I'm gay I'm going to want to act in your piece of shit? ﻿why? No feathers? ﻿Speak straight to me. ﻿The newbie is hot, huh? ﻿Will you sit with her? ﻿Very well... ﻿Ética. ﻿Ethics, in principle, ﻿it is important to understand that it is the territory of philosophy, ﻿Right? ﻿It is a theoretical quest for Good and Evil. ﻿Could someone give me an example that comes to mind? ﻿Ethics is not moral. ﻿Morality is how you act in a given situation. ﻿So according to morals can you steal? ﻿No, because there is not just one moral, there are many. ﻿Because each society is unique. ﻿See how the Arabs treat women, ﻿It's okay for them. ﻿what else? ﻿I don't understand the difference. ﻿Here until recently women did not vote. ﻿Yes, very well, but... ﻿The moral concepts of societies are changing, they are changing. ﻿Well, I'm going to give you a text to study for the test. ﻿Warn those who aren't here, take care of your friends. ﻿See you later. ﻿Careful, it's hot. ﻿This one? ﻿No, it has to be a two- pin. ﻿Of the ancients. ﻿This one is perfect. ﻿This one yes. ﻿Yesterday I met a girl in the park who is from the same school as me. ﻿Seriously? ﻿She said there's an ice cream shop nearby that's delicious. ﻿Excellent ﻿ ﻿Leave it and have breakfast. ﻿Can we go there someday? ﻿I told you I can't pick you up from school every day. ﻿I didn't say every day. When you can. ﻿And what about La Plata? ﻿Said we'd be coming and going? ﻿to see the pope ﻿Going on the graduation trip? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Well, I'm just saying. ﻿Don't promise so many things. ﻿I'll wait for you in the car. ﻿Come on, come on. Silence because we have little time. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Let's go with this scene, okay? ﻿Come on. Everyone attentive? ﻿Now. ﻿We demand that you recognize our right to ex... ﻿"To externalize our own thinking". ﻿"We are tired of tyrants and 'demagogols'". ﻿Guys, silence. ﻿"Demagogues". ﻿"We are tired of tyrants and demagogues." ﻿All right, let's do it again. All over again. ﻿What are you looking at? ﻿I liked your earrings. ﻿Bought in Barcelona. ﻿Do you know? ﻿No. I never left the country. ﻿My father doesn't want to go anymore. ﻿He is afraid of terrorists. ﻿Terrorists must be afraid of their parents. ﻿What were you doing? ﻿Nothing. ﻿Your boyfriend will be happy. ﻿Boyfriend? ﻿I didn't understand. ﻿for you. ﻿I have others ﻿Looks good on you, huh? ﻿Thanks. ﻿Let me do just one thing. ﻿That's better. ﻿Hey, Cami! ﻿Come, let's go! ﻿What are you doing here?

Girlfriend? ﻿No? ﻿Are you a virgin? ﻿How many times a day do you masturbate? ﻿I doubt this one is a virgin, friend. ﻿I didn't say anything. ﻿If you are a virgin, so is the Virgin Mary. ﻿- That is... - That is, not at all. ﻿Hello. ﻿Hello. ﻿A capitalist drink. ﻿Or famous Cuba Libre. ﻿Quite ironic if you think about it. ﻿Do you like politics, are you an activist? ﻿I feel like I fell in the worst place. ﻿It's a school that poisons you. One more reason. ﻿I don't want to make trouble for my mother. ﻿Does it have anything to do with change? ﻿No, my grandmother. ﻿She's on her last legs. ﻿Oh, this sucks. ﻿She's an old fascist. ﻿Never cared about us. ﻿Well, but it can't be easy for your mother. ﻿Even though she's a monster, ﻿is still her mother. ﻿Can I tell you something stupid? ﻿Coming from you, I don't think it's going to be stupid. ﻿For a moment I thought you had followed us. ﻿That you'd seen a story on Instagram or something. ﻿It's pretty idiocy. ﻿And this one? ﻿It was the first. ﻿and this? ﻿I had smoked a lot. ﻿This one I was in love with. ﻿Was? ﻿Are you selling this? ﻿When did my heart break. ﻿where were you? ﻿I ran out of battery. ﻿Answer what I asked you, Cami. ﻿I was with a friend. ﻿I told you: go get Martina. ﻿Did you take the flashlight that was in the room? ﻿No. ﻿You were smoking weed, weren't you? ﻿Oh mom, you smoked with your boyfriend... ﻿Cami. ﻿What do you have? ﻿You are a stress ball. ﻿Gotta get out of the optics 'cause you're walking around, ﻿smoking weed, ﻿Without cellphone. ﻿We are in Buenos Aires. ﻿Do you think I don't know that? ﻿Change your tone. ﻿Leave me alone! ﻿Camila. ﻿Camila, listen to me. ﻿Camila! ﻿- Camila, open the door! - I don't want! ﻿You can't talk to me like that! ﻿Camilla open the door ﻿and ask me for forgiveness! ﻿What happened? ﻿nothing. I can not take it anymore. ﻿I'm like a cat. ﻿And why did you sign up for it? ﻿I don't know. I thought it was just to float around a bit. ﻿No. ﻿Do you already know each other? ﻿Yea. ﻿What are you doing dressed in civilian clothes? ﻿Clara, is this civil for you? ﻿Do you have lice or are you just here to see the girls? ﻿And you? ﻿What did I miss? ﻿Nothing. ﻿Can I borrow your cell phone? ﻿Yes, but I left it in the backpack. ﻿See if that works. ﻿It cost. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿What will you do later? ﻿nothing. call me. ﻿You skate? ﻿I tried, but it's not my thing. ﻿And what do you like? ﻿Numbers. ﻿Seriously? ﻿Chemistry too. I have a lot of ease. ﻿I like a tattooed chemist. ﻿A broken heart tattoo ﻿It's for Clara, isn't it? ﻿Me and Clara? ﻿No broken hearts. ﻿We sat together in sixth grade, ﻿in those classes that force you to mingle. ﻿And we got along well, we liked the same things. ﻿coups? ﻿Fetos? ﻿No. ﻿The music of the 80's. ﻿I don't know, our first joint from the first drinking bouts. ﻿I wasn't jealous. ﻿So I'm going to get a tattoo here: "Camila Forever". ﻿What do we ask for mom? ﻿Rice? ﻿I think she doesn't eat noodles. ﻿What if we ask her to prove it? ﻿I don't know. ﻿And what do you want? ﻿Fried sweet potatoes. ﻿That's not Chinese. ﻿Enjoy and ask for the special. ﻿You always eat french fries. ﻿I know. It's because I like French fries. ﻿Because he said that Columbus was good and I said no, that he was racist. ﻿- And I said... - And what did he tell you? ﻿nothing. He said it was another time. ﻿I said that Jesus was not a racist and that he lived long before. ﻿- You will be president. - I know. ﻿Olá. ﻿- Hello. - Sorry... ﻿Are you Cecilia's relatives? ﻿Yes, we are the granddaughters. ﻿Sorry to bother you, but how is her health? ﻿- She's... - She's stable. ﻿We are waiting for news. ﻿All right...

You? ﻿Church garbage, you are a dictatorship. ﻿- Wow! - No, no, no! ﻿Folks, no. ﻿You go to the board. ﻿Let's start again. Please sit there. ﻿Let's go again, please. Silence. ﻿Wait for me in the car. ﻿You've been suspended for a week. ﻿Show me your cell phone. ﻿I know this is all very important to you ﻿and maybe you don't care, ﻿but I agree with you on many things. ﻿You can behave right. Preach your ideals without making any noise. ﻿Mom, what are you saying? ﻿You know what this school is like. ﻿You know better than I do. ﻿If you put your or your sister's education at risk, ﻿I swear it will cost you more than an insult. ﻿- Hello. - Hello. ﻿' What's up? ' ﻿What mausoleum is this? ﻿So this is where you live. ﻿Are you millionaire? ﻿No. My grandmother is the one with the money. ﻿We do not. ﻿She won't live forever anyway. ﻿Lourdes ... ﻿O hometown? ﻿And your mother? ﻿It's working. ﻿And your sister? ﻿With her father. ﻿So the house is ours. ﻿Do you have air conditioning? ﻿No, it doesn't. ﻿Lourdes. ﻿How do you not have air conditioning? ﻿My grandmother is a millionaire, but she is cheap. ﻿It saves energy and stuff. ﻿Typical. ﻿These are my grandmother's. ﻿We wash later. ﻿We could tell you what happened, but you didn't miss a thing. ﻿A conversation about the graduation trip raffle ﻿who "suggested" that we participate. ﻿Yea. ﻿A lecture on political neutrality. ﻿This one we owe you. ﻿The famous neutrality of the church? ﻿Abortionists came out of the closet, at least. ﻿Abortionists? ﻿Lourdes... ﻿we are among friends, give it a break. ﻿What are we going to do today? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Cinema? Cami ﻿It's Friday. ﻿It's been locked in here for a week. Let's go out. ﻿Go out? ﻿So you like to roll? ﻿- You too. - Ever. ﻿And what did I give you? ﻿To tell you the truth, ﻿It's so beautiful I don't want to use it. ﻿I know you like me. ﻿What did you think it was? ﻿And your boyfriend? ﻿I already told you I don't have a boyfriend. ﻿Now don't you have? ﻿Bruno? ﻿Your friend? ﻿Don't mess with him. ﻿I love him very much. ﻿He also loves you very much. ﻿Let's not talk about Bruno. ﻿What do you want to talk about? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Another thing. ﻿I like your blouse. ﻿If you give me a kiss maybe I'll give you her. ﻿- Are you blackmailing me? - No. ﻿Come on, let me... I have a lot of clothes. ﻿You are unbearable, man. ﻿Girls. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Pablo. ﻿He needs to go somewhere with you. ﻿So... ﻿No! It's mine. ﻿You have to take it. ﻿Because I have a Tinder date and he's drunk. ﻿So bye. ﻿- I love you. - Hey dude? ﻿No, no, no. ﻿And who are these? ﻿You have to speak down. ﻿It's my grandmother with a friend. ﻿A friend? ﻿- Looks more like a girlfriend. What are you saying? ﻿What are you saying? ﻿Look, I'm not a silent girl. ﻿What is it? ﻿My bitch grandma doesn't want us to use the bed. ﻿Let's go out today. ﻿Did you tell your parents? ﻿No. ﻿I'm like a stranger to my parents. ﻿If they judge me, they go crazy. So don't judge me. ﻿And you? ﻿Do you judge? ﻿Sometimes. ﻿It's like something they put in their brain. ﻿Stick. ﻿they tell you ﻿that you can erase, ﻿but something gets registered as a mark. ﻿Like a computer you say? ﻿The computer you change. ﻿I mean... ﻿Depending on how much money you have... ﻿you end up changing it. ﻿We are more than an old computer, Pablo. ﻿Don't fall in love with that girl. ﻿She is Franco's ex. ﻿Have fun, but don't fall in love. ﻿Boys. ﻿Silence, please. ﻿What's your problem? ﻿I didn't like what you did. ﻿So what? ﻿nothing. Now I wanted to invite you for a few beers. ﻿No. ﻿Why not? ﻿Because it's not. ﻿- Why not? Enough, Franco, stop bothering her. ﻿- Why are you getting involved? I get involved in whatever I want. ﻿What are you looking at? ﻿I prefer to keep what happened the other day just between us. ﻿I know. I'm not an idiot. ﻿I thought you weren't even going to talk to me. ﻿Don't overdo it. ﻿Don't you feel like you're two people? ﻿What do you mean... ﻿I don't know... The girl with the long skirt, ﻿the one who smokes, ﻿legal abortion. ﻿Who said I support this? ﻿And what you say bothers me a little. ﻿I'm not two people. ﻿What do you think? ﻿Just because we sleep together I have to think like you? ﻿- I wasn't accusing you of anything. A little, yes. ﻿You kind of think you're on the right side of something that... ﻿Have you ever gotten pregnant? ﻿What's that got to do with it? ﻿Maybe it has. ﻿I don't know. ﻿You could hear a little bit what other people are saying. ﻿What happened? ﻿You are confusing me. ﻿- Hi, Mom! - Hello! ﻿How was school? ﻿I need to practice my English. ﻿Yes. ﻿Shall we have the ice cream you wanted? ﻿Let's go. ﻿Excellent. ﻿Give me five minutes because I have to talk to your sister. ﻿See something strange? ﻿What is it? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿I'm asking you what this bra is doing here. ﻿You're not asking me, you're ambushing me. ﻿No. ﻿No. ﻿I am your mother and this is my home. It's not your house. And I asked you not to come in here. ﻿Even more so with a boy. ﻿It's not your home. And that bra is not mine. ﻿Good... ﻿I was with a girl. ﻿It's okay. I thought you liked boys. ﻿Me too. But let's not talk about that. ﻿Why can't we talk? ﻿Because you're my mother and you're boring. I don't want to talk about it. ﻿That's why. 'Cause I'm your mother and I set the rules for you ﻿and I would like you to fulfill them. ﻿It's not your rules. These are the rules of a dying old woman. ﻿Mom. ﻿Mom. ﻿I thought you were ignoring me. ﻿I have to tell you something. ﻿I sleep with Clara. ﻿Say something. ﻿What do you want me to tell you? ﻿I don't know. How are you feeling. ﻿Weird. ﻿Strange with jealousy? ﻿Why did you tell me this now? ﻿You asked me if I was ignoring you. ﻿I don't understand, does that make you angry? ﻿No, I'm not mad. ﻿Boys are tough these days. ﻿Is that why you sleep with girls? ﻿I don't sleep with girls. I slept with one. ﻿Am I a guy like the others? ﻿I didn't say that. ﻿I don't know what you mean. ﻿Me neither. ﻿This is very spicy. ﻿Clara! ﻿What do you want? ﻿Get in or you'll regret it for the rest of your life. ﻿- Where are you going? - Come on in. ﻿“We students ask for very important things ﻿and we will do them quickly and on time". ﻿- Don't be mean, Pablo. - They played rugby. ﻿They're a spoiled bunch who can't read. ﻿I'll have as much fun as I want. ﻿Oh, I forgot the torch. ﻿No... ﻿What torch? ﻿nothing. My stuff. ﻿It doesn't matter. ﻿And you, Bulma, are you going to the demonstration? ﻿I don't know. You go? ﻿Bulma? ﻿Now you have secret nicknames. ﻿No. We dyed our hair blue once. ﻿Her parents nearly killed her. ﻿I was awful anyway. ﻿Today we are going to dye it green. Your father will love it. ﻿Oh go. ﻿EDUCATION.PREVENTION. FREEDOM OF CHOICE ﻿WITH CLOTHES OR WITHOUT CLOTHES, MY BODY MUST NOT BE TOUCHED ﻿THE BEST WAY TO PERPETUATE PATRIARCHY IS TO EAT ANIMALS ﻿Hello. ﻿Do you know where the cereal is? ﻿I have no idea. ﻿Yesterday I went to the protest with the girls. I have to go, Cami. ﻿Bye. ﻿Stop it. ﻿How are you? ﻿I'm fine. ﻿We haven't talked in a long time. ﻿Are you mad at me? ﻿I'm not angry with you. ﻿Sometimes I'm afraid we'll end up here, ﻿then we go to college and you don't talk to me anymore. ﻿That would be silly. ﻿We were always together. ﻿I already told you. ﻿I don't want to have any problems with you. ﻿Don't you want to have problems? ﻿And what do you want to have? ; ﻿People change. ﻿Please. ﻿Don't be stubborn. ﻿If so, then I don't want to be a part of it anymore. ﻿Part of what? ﻿From the lie. ﻿I lied for you. ﻿I forgive you. ﻿If you tell me it's over, it's over. ﻿But I have to do what has to be done. ﻿why, dear? ﻿Because it's the right thing to do. ﻿To Confess. ﻿You will ruin my life. ﻿Maybe you haven't changed that much ﻿how much do you think. ﻿Can you give this to Camila? ﻿pass to cami ﻿Cami. ﻿LOCKER ROOM? ﻿Talk, silly. ﻿There's something on your face. ﻿How stupid are you. ﻿don't make noise ﻿or you will have problems. ﻿Got it? ﻿What's going on? ﻿You come with me. ﻿Come in. ﻿Idiot! ﻿Paul, get out. ﻿- Stop, stop! - What got into you? ﻿Stop it! ﻿Please. ﻿Wait outside. ﻿Nobody answers. ﻿What are you going to do? ﻿Nothing. ﻿Nothing? ﻿Is this a joke? ﻿It's sexual abuse. ﻿- Girls... - It's abuse! ﻿He arrives! ﻿Let's hear both sides and see what to do. ﻿For now, nothing. ﻿It's unfair. ﻿In a month he will graduate. ﻿What do you want me to do? Kick him out? Kick him out because of a fight? Argument? ﻿You're on edge, Lourdes. ﻿Yes? ﻿You are 17 years old. ﻿A lifetime ahead to do what they want. ﻿Why don't you work things out? ﻿Enjoy the trip. We ended the year well. ﻿I'm asking you, please. ﻿Friend. ﻿- Hey. - Friend! ﻿Excuse me, excuse me. I wasn't going to do anything... I know, I know. ﻿They told me you can't be here. I don't know where to take him. I'll take it. ﻿Seriously? ﻿- Yes. - It's all right. ﻿You can't stay here any longer. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Fuck you. ﻿She doesn't answer. ﻿She must be working, Cami. ﻿No, I was a jerk yesterday. ﻿She doesn't even look at my face. ﻿Are you ok? ﻿What are you feeling? ﻿I got lucky. ﻿She's an idiot. I told you she was shit. Pablo, not helping. ﻿Did I tell you or not? Enough, Pablo, it's not helping. ﻿Let's do what you say. Turn everything upside down. ﻿- School is like that, Cami. - No, no. ﻿No... ﻿It's useless. ﻿Also, it won't change anything. ﻿I want to go home. ﻿Are there kids in your class who annoy others? ﻿There's one they call fat, ﻿another one they call gay. ﻿And why do they do this? ﻿What do you think? ﻿I don't know. ﻿They are kind of idiots. ﻿Complete idiots. ﻿These are first- rate coffins. ﻿I'm offering you the best we have. ﻿Also, they pair up in the pantheon with their father's coffin. ﻿This is paid? ﻿No. It's just the wishes stipulated by your mother. ﻿But don't worry because we take care of the transport, ﻿the car is imported, very elegant, ﻿the team is first rate. ﻿All our services include crowns. ﻿Crowns? ﻿These are imported white roses. Oh, imported roses too. ﻿Do not worry. ﻿We're out of season, but they're in the pack if you like. ﻿Good... ﻿If everything is in order, what remains is the table service. ﻿- 'We have... - No ﻿- We have... - No. ﻿I will not bury my mother in that terrible pantheon, ﻿much less spend money on what you're offering me. ﻿My mother is dead and so are most of her friends. ﻿I don't care and we're not going to be a part of it. ﻿Poor mama, she was never a free woman. Let her be free now that she is dead. ﻿Let's cream it. ﻿And the ashes later we see where to throw. ﻿I understand. I'll show you the urn catalog. ﻿And of course, with all our services, the crowns. ﻿Let's go? ﻿Do you want? ﻿Oh, do you smoke too? ﻿Sometimes I take a drag. ﻿Never buy is the rule. ﻿I was pretty naughty the other day. ﻿Yes. ﻿Look, Cami, I don't know if I'm a very strong woman, ﻿but i know i'm a good person. ﻿So I wish you would treat me better. ﻿I thought I was okay with the change story... ﻿- But... - I'm not doing well at school. ﻿I didn't want to tell you. ﻿It was not my intention. ﻿I know. ﻿Ok... ﻿If you want to take the tests remotely, you will no longer need to go to school. ﻿You don't worry me, Cami. ﻿I admire you. ﻿If I weren't your mother, I'd be a little jealous of you ﻿because you don't care what others think when you say... ﻿And say what you think. ﻿You too, mom. ﻿Which? ﻿You are like that too. ﻿Come here. ﻿But that kitten has to go You know, don't you? ﻿- Yes. - Yea. ﻿How do you feel about your grandmother? ﻿I don't have much time. ﻿I'm waiting for my mother. ﻿Will you return to La Plata? ﻿Clara, ﻿tell me what you have to tell me. ﻿Don't wind me up. ﻿Do you remember when I asked if you were ever pregnant? ﻿When I was dating Franco, I had an abortion. ﻿And now he's threatening to tell my parents. ﻿I wanted to tell you in the locker room, ﻿but Franco showed up and... I don't know... ﻿I was scared. ﻿Sorry... ﻿for what he did to you. ﻿And I didn't do anything... ﻿hurt me, ﻿but i understand. ﻿Someday you're going to have to rethink whether it's worth being afraid. ﻿Evaluate yourself. ﻿Make sure you're not giving away for free... ﻿a beautiful thing. ﻿Do you forgive me? ﻿- Hi, how are you? - How are you? ﻿Welcome. ﻿Hello. ﻿Come in. ﻿Good afternoon. ﻿Hello, how are you? ﻿come in.
