Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Episode 18 But I remember everything. So, how can I? When I can still remember everything, how can I accept your feelings? I can't do that. No matter how I try, I can't. It may be that I never truly loved Jae Young. Because at some point, I stopped being able to remember things about her. But, what do I do now? Now when it hurts so much, now when I can remember your every little detail? What do I do when it hurts so much? There is probably nothing I'm able to offer you, but it hurts so much. I was a bit overboard today, wasn't I? Since you opened up to me something you've been holding inside you, shall I as well? Our father was a very cold man. I was always afraid of Father, but Hyung wasn't. Until just before Father died, Hyung was always battling with him. It was enough to make you not want to come home. The battles between Father and Hyung had a viciousness about them. In the midst of them, our mother cried a lot in her life. I didn't want to come home, but I couldn't stay away because of our mother. If she didn't have at least me to talk to, she would have been too lonely. So, that's probably why Jae Young appealed to me. No matter what happened, she never cried. It was strange to me to meet a girl that didn't cry, and I think that's why she appealed to me. My mom was the same as you. I listened whenever she needed to talk, but strangely, she was only fond of Hyung. And she was always just waiting for Hyung. What are you doing? I'm waiting for your Hyung. Have you ever waited for me? You've never made me wait. That's why I'm grateful. I guess Lawyer Won went somewhere far away? He came home late every night. And so, he and Father would have it out every night. But Lawyer Won is such an exemplary type of person. He changed after Father passed away. Like someone who returned from a brutal battleground, he was worn. Talking about that sure makes feel lighter inside. Pal Gang, Why didn't you appear just a little earlier. Then my time living with such frustration would have been a lot shorter. But, since it's much better than being resentful, I'll forgive you for showing up late. Hyung. What? Reconsider. What? Getting married to Jae Young. Hyung, you don't love her. You love someone else. Go to bed. Fight like crazy, as you did with Father. You knew you could never beat him, but you always stood up against him. I don't understand why you think it can't be Pal Gang. Because I'm a materialistic pig. Stop making excuses like that. What's the real reason? That's the reason. Is it because of me? Then don't be like that. Stepping aside is like a habit to me. Go to bed. Pal Gang knows too many things about you. She knows all your little habits that you're not even aware of. Stop talking nonsense and go to bed. I begged her to look at me. But she says she can't. She says she's tried but she can't. That's how much she... Please just get out and go to bed! I've given you an opportunity. This is the final opportunity. So don't miss it. That kind of opportunity, I don't need. Then from now on, the person at Pal Gang's side will be me. Do me a favor. Don't sway her again. Draw up my will again, and include Pal Gang as an heir. Give her the same rights as Jae Young. Understand? Yes. I'll do that. Kang Ha. Yes, Chairman? Can I ask you something? I've never seen a side of you that I saw yesterday. I've never seen you talk so much. Did Pal Gang bring that out in you? I want to know if perhaps you have feelings for her. Chairman, Yes? I'm going to marry Jae Young. I'm getting a very strange feeling. The way you're talking sounds like you've decided to jump into a fire holding gunpowder. Did I misinterpret that? Yes. You misinterpreted. Well, that's a relief, then. Think about it carefully. A marriage made between two people who don't care for each other can only bring both parties misery and suffering. Don't forget that. That was really a good decision on your part to come back to work here. That's right. But, do you think you can work taking Nam Yi and Pa Rang around with you? Pa Rang will be going to school soon, so I only need to take him till then, and I've gotten so used to taking Nam Yi around, it doesn't feel hard at all anymore. - Jin Pal Gang. - Oh! Shall we have a word? Jin Pal Gang. You are a woman of some surprising skills. I'm talking about getting in the good graces of my grandfather. What are you talking about? So, he knew your father, I hear. But your father never told you who he was, is that it? Isn't that what you're saying? Is that possible? He even provided the building and backing for the hospital, but you just knew him as ragamuffin junk dealer Grandfather? That's what you're trying to say, right? Regardless of what you want to think, that is the truth. What do you think about us getting a little more frank. What could be the problem being a little more frank when you're already in Grandfather's good graces? I am being frank. What is it that you really want? Don't you think I need to know just how big your ambitions are so that I can take measures? Now that such a foolish person as yourself is a JK stakeholder, don't you think it's proper decorum for you to inform me, the JK successor, how you expect me to handle the situation? What do you mean a JK stakeholder? Are you really going to act that innocent? I really don't know what you're talking about. Someone like you, without a drop of his blood, becomes one of Grandfather's heirs, and you're trying to tell me you don't know what I'm talking about?! Are you telling me I'm to be one of Grandfather's heirs? You have a knack of really making a person feel fed up. I'm sorry. I'm going to need to go. Jin Pal Gang. Jin Pal Gang! What's going on? What did you say to Pal Gang? She's going through a hard time right now even without you, so leave her alone. You... marry that woman, Jin Pal Gang. That woman is no longer just an FC with the worst record. She's now an heir in my Grandfather's will. What? What's this I hear about Pal Gang becoming an heir in the Chairman's will. How did you find out about that? Jae Young told me. What is that about? How can Pal Gang become an heir of the Chairman's? It's the Chairman's will. Have a seat. I hear I'm to be your heir. What's going on? Who'd you hear it from? Kang Ha? I told him not to mention it yet. I heard from Manager Jung Jae Young. Mmm, I see. Why would I become your heir? Who am I to be one? Sit. Sit and let's talk. I told you I don't want you to make me into a Lotto winner, Grandfather, I mean Chairman. Ah, I'll just call you Grandfather. I'm too used to calling you Grandfather that the word Chairman doesn't come out easily. Go ahead. I like Grandfather better than Chairman anyway. What are you doing without my knowing? I told you to sit. The issue isn't about whether I'm sitting or standing, Grandfather! Geez, kid. Ultimately, you're making this old man stand up. Pal Gang, Yes? You're no different than a blood-related grandchild to me. Isn't it natural for a grandchild to be an heir? That's what I want to do, so don't say a thing and just let it go. I'll take care of everything. I don?t' want to. It's different than winning the Lotto. To me it's the same. You're doing this because of the relationship you had with my parents. It's not something I earned through gritting my teeth. Why should I receive such a thing? Then do something good. And don't frivolously spend what I leave you. I don't want it. I want to take the money I work hard to earn and spend it frivolously with my siblings. So you do something good with your estate. Instead of giving me this needless headache. What's such a headache? You don't need to do anything. I'm scared of what I might do with that money! You know how I used to live. I even stole the money that Cho Rok saved from selling junk with you, and got a perm with it. That's the kind of person I am. I'm the kind of person that will get in debt over my head just to get a handbag. But, say I get free money overnight. I don't know what kind of stunt I might pull. Just don't live like that. I don't trust myself. Back then, I couldn't tell anyone, but I didn't like that me very much. Every night, my head ached from thinking "I probably shouldn't live like this. " But now, I don't get those headaches. I don't have any money or things, but I'm at peace with myself. If I work hard and earn money, then my situation will get better... thinking like that really makes me feel comfortable and at peace. So, please just leave me be, won't you? Grandfather, please. What are you saying right now? If Jin Pal Gang marries Jun Ha, it will get resolved cleanly. Are you seriously suggesting Jun Ha marry that girl? Then she becomes a justifiable heir. Jun Ha always thought in the same way I did so he won't let her do anything reckless with her share of the company. That's what you think. Do you think Jun Ha would really agree to marrying that girl? He will. Tell me you'll respect my wishes. You need to give me time to think... Write it out right now, you're will or whatever. Jin Pal Gang is NOT an heir. Listen kid, what kind of will specifies people that are not heirs? I'm saying it cause I don't know what trouble you'll cook up with out my knowing. I'm asking you to make it official. Geez, this kid... Yeah, come to my office. - Sit down. - Yes. This kid, Pal Gang, is killing me. This is something we can resolve on our own. Why would you call in Lawyer Won? I would call in Kang Ha cause he's the lawyer that writes up my will, wouldn't I? Ahh, is that the case? Grandfather, you don't know your letters? Why get someone else to write out one little will? Someone who's successful like me has a fancy lawyer draw up his will. It must be nice, being successful. It is nice. Happy now? If not, then you become successful and ask Kang Ha to draw up your will. Um, the reason you called me... Ah, Pal Gang kept distracting me and making me talk, I totally forgot. About the will, about including Pal Gang as an heir. let's forget about it. She's making such ruckus about making it on her own and to butt out, that I'm planning to sit back and watch just how well she does. Well, don't hold a grudge about it or anything. I don't want to give my hard-earned money to someone who's hopping up and down about not wanting it, anyway. You're really making the right decision. Now that we've done what you've asked, you're satisfied, right? Yes. Then go on out, work hard, and earn money. Okay. Then, I'll be off to earn my money. That stubborn will of hers. Then we'll just keep the old will. Mmm, no. Excuse me? Make the changes quickly without her knowing. I think it was a mistake to tell my family first. I was short-sighted. I didn't think how that kid's existence could become a prickly issue to my family. Draw up a new will without anyone other than you and I knowing. Hooray! Why don't you give Nam Yi to me, Team Manager. You need to go and have lunch. I'm close with Nam Yi. Isn't that right, Nam? Ahjussi, Hmm? Where does Lawyer Ahjussi work? Why? Can't I just pop in and see him for a minute? Aigoo, what took you so long? I had to resolve an important matter. Why do you have our Nam Yi? Our Nam Yi really likes it when I hold him. Ah, Pa Rang, shall we go eat some jjajangmyun? Give Nam Yi to me. People are looking at you strangely. Who cares if they are looking at me strangely. Let them look. Noona, can't I visit Lawyer Ahjussi before we go? Pa Rang, are you really going to be like that? I'm offering to buy you tasty jjajangmyun, so if you keep just looking for Lawyer Ahjussi, this Ahjussi is going to get peeved. I'm sorry. It's just that I'm close with Lawyer Ahjussi, so please understand. Ahjussi! Pa Rang. What are you doing here at the office? I came with Noona. I'm going to be going to work with Noona from now on. Oh, really? We're going to eat jjajangmyun. Come with us, Ahjussi. I'm sorry. I have some urgent work to do, so I don't think I can go. Isn't it lunch time? Aren't you supposed to eat at lunch time? I've got some urgent work, so I don't have time to eat right now. Ahjussi! Ahjussi! Pa Rang, let's get on the elevator. Give me Nam Yi and please eat. Aigoo. You eat first. Excuse me, Ahjussi. Huh? About Lawyer Ahjussi... There you go again, looking for Lawyer Ahjussi. This Ahjussi is really gonna get peeved. That's not what I mean. About Lawyer Ahjussi, is he really going to marry that Ahjumma that came over that day? I told him not to. Just eat your lunch. You have some time after work, don't you? There aren't a lot of days before the engagement. Let's go to my mother's shop after work and pick out some things we may need. You'll come, right? All right. Thanks ever so much for being so agreeable. Don't drag them around. Just leave them at the daycare. It's okay for them to come with me. It's not for you. I just think it would be hard on Pa Rang and Nam Yi. I'll just... Just do as I say. What kind of sister puts her younger siblings through all that? You have to earn a lot of money quickly. If you want to do that, you can't be taking Nam Yi and Pa Rang around with you. Isn't that so? And this is really just too ridiculous. You've already paid a month's dues, does it make any sense to let that all go down the drain? How are you going to make it if you're so bad at such calculations. After work, I'll pick up Pa Rang and Nam Yi from daycare, so just come by the house. No, I just have one meeting with a client so don't worry about the kids. Good bye. Pal Gang. Yes? For the time-being just work really hard. Then you won't think about other things. During that time, I'll stay beside you as a friend. I gave Hyung... a final opportunity. So now, I won't feel bad about it anymore. Are you from JK life? Ah, yes. Hello. I'm JK FC Jin Pal Gang that spoke to you on the phone earlier. But, how is it you asked for me? The word has spread that you are an FC who treats clients like family. That's why I called. I'm thinking of opening up a life insurance policy. A contract like this will probably land you some nice bonus, yes? Excuse me? Oh, yes. This is what they refer to as win-win. It's good for you and it's good for me. Well then, I have another engagement here, so if you'll excuse me... Yes, client sir. Thank you. Thank you. - Good bye. I'll see you again. - Yes. Is she really the one with the worst record? Yes, Hyungnim. She doesn't seem like she would be. And look at those wallets. This looks pretty good. Show me that, please. Do you like it? Uh, yes. What about this one? Yeah, good. I'm going to the restroom. He looks like a cow being led to a butcher. Mom. Must you marry a guy like him? Why are you doing this, Mom? Can't you at least let me relax? If I let you relax, do you think you'll feel relaxed? Pal Gang knows too many things about you. She knows all your little habits that you're not even aware of. What are you doing here? We have a lot to do today. But, I think Nam Yi isn't in such a good condition. Excuse me? The color of his bowel movements is off, and he threw up twice today. Other days, he napped a little and played a lot, but today, he didn't play at all. Maybe it's because his environment changed suddenly. Chairman, you coming to visit such a humble place like this, I really don't know what to make of it all. What can I do when Pal Gang and the kids are living here? The person who's missing them needs to come find them. But Chairman, is this Korean cattle beef? Yes, I told them to give me the good stuff, but I'm not sure how it will taste. Oh, they're here. Come on in. The Chairman and Team Manager Won are here. Wow, it's meat! What are you doing here? I bought some meat. You're not going to give me a hard time about that too, are you? That would be a little to harsh of you. Hey, I didn't even dream that you had this sort of bond with the Chairman. When I came and heard that the Chairman was here, I almost collapsed from the shock. Pal Gang, you're life has just totally opened up. Nothing like what you're thinking is happening, so stop talking nonsense. Team Manager even bought stuff like this to give us. This one's yours. This has GPS. What is this? Well you've moved out of our house and all. And I get curious about where the kids are. If I do this, I can see where you all are. Wow. And if I do this, I can hear what you're doing. Wanna hear? Sing a song. Goblins' panties are dirty. They wear them after shaking them off, They wear them after flipping them inside out. Wow, that's really amazing. You can totally hear me singing. Wow that is really amazing. Oh and I have one for you too. I'm not a child. Why include me? Our Team Manager Ahjussi is a really deep, thoughtful person. And, he bought this too. He brought a frame for our picture. Hey I brought meat. Don't you think you're talking up Team Manager Ahjussi just a little too much? Grandfather, why are you being so petty? So, just eat some of the meat and say it's tasty, won't you? Here, here. Eat. I think you're going to have to take him to see a doctor. He's thrown up 4 times today everything he's eaten. Pa Rang, stay here just for a bit. Grandma Eun Mal will be hear shortly. Pal Gang said she'll be late and I have to go to my eldest son's right now. Don't worry about them, and go. I'll take the kids to our house. I feel like we're putting you out too much, Team Manager. Wow! I'm so super glad to see you guys! Especially, you, Cho Rok There's no one like you to me. I heard you took Nam Yi to the doctor. Is Nam Yi sick? I brought the kids to our house, so I'll come over. No, there's no need. He's not that bad. He's just vomiting a little. Jin Nam Yi's guardian? Yes! I have to go. Oppa, look at this. Isn't this cool? Did you bring this to give me? There really isn't anyone like you to me. No, this isn't to give you. We're going to give it to Lawyer Ahjussi as a wedding present. He let us stay in this house that whole time. We should get him a wedding present, at least. Oppa. Now that Lawyer Ahjussi is getting married, you just need to beat Team Manager ahjussi. Do your best, okay? I am trying to do my best, but I don't know if that will do any good. What kind of man are you. Muster up that courage. Fighting, okay? Yeah. Fighting! Ahjussi! Please take this. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding. It's not much, but our hearts are in it, so please accept it. You can change it to your wedding pictures later. Right. Thanks. Then, please rest. Why aren't you going out? Are you really going to get married? With that snotty looking Ahjumma? That's right. I'm going to get married. Then I can't sleep with you anymore, can I? If you married our sister, I could have slept next to you. Ahjussi, you're really bad. You like Noona. I know it all. It's a blocked biliary tract. A blocked biliary tract? What is that? To put it simply, his biliary tract did not develop fully, so the bile cannot be discharged through the intestines, but accumulates in the liver, damaging it, and is ultimately be a fatal condition. N- n-no, that can't be. Our Nam Yi is so healthy. He eats well and plays well, and hasn't gotten significantly sick before. That's the characteristic of this condition. It's usually discovered pretty late because the child seems to have been growing well and healthy. Doctor! What do we need to do? Please treat him right away, huh? Doctor! Because it worsens very quickly, the best method to treat it right now is a transplant surgery. Since you are siblings, you should all get examined as possible donors. From the test results, it looks like you can't be a donor. Aside from their being no room, the gastroenterology surgeon is away on a seminar and can't treat him right now. Then what do we do? I'll find a hospital where surgery is possible. But even if he checks in, finding a donor is the most urgent issue. Go to that hospital and have your family all get examined. I have to find his birth parents or siblings. Please let me know. I know you're in a bad situation, but the orphanage that child was adopted from no longer exists. Please let me know a way! Please? I beg you. Please? Tomorrow is the engagement, so go home early tonight and rest. You'll do that for me, won't you? I understand. Go on out. Anyhow, thanks. Go on out. You're going home early, right? Let's have some food, Nam Yi. You have to eat. Just a little more. Just a little more. I'll find a hospital where surgery is possible. But even if he checks in, finding a donor is the most urgent issue. What exactly are you doing here right now? It's just this once, today. Let's let it go for just this one time, Won Kang Ha. Since you won't ever come back again. Since you can't ever come back again. Hello? Yes? This is Jin Pal Gang. Yes? Really? If I go there now, I can meet with her? Taxi! Taxi! [Gusan Catholic Church] [Starlight Angels Ward] Lawyer Won, how did you... What are you doing? Is your pride that important? If living got that difficult, you should have asked the Chairman or me for help! No, since I have no right, you should have asked Jun Ha for help! So, what you came up with... was to leave Nam Yi at an orphanage? If you don't know what you're talking about, then don't interfere and just go. You turn down the Chairman's offer of inheritance, and then think of leaving Nam Yi at an orphanage?! Does that make any sense, woman?! What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you thinking? Our Nam Yi is sick! Nam Yi is sick! I'm really sorry for disturbing you so late. It's just so urgent that I had to come and see you. What does it matter what time it is when the child is sick? I heard you were at the orphanage where Nam Yi once was. Yes, I did work there at the time. I have to find Nam Yi's birth parents or siblings. He has to have a liver transplant surgery, but I'm not a match for a donor. My other siblings haven't been tested, but they're not blood related, so the likelihood is high they won't match. And even, if they did match, they're so young, I don't know if they could handle surgery. But, oh dear. Nam Yi was abandoned without any note in front of the orphanage. In situations like this, it's too difficult to find the birth parents. So you're saying your siblings are not blood-related? So you're saying your parents adopted all your siblings, aren't you? Then are you... I'm their daughter by birth. Why did you never mention it? Why should I? My siblings are not related by blood. Why do I need to say that sort of thing? But why are you carrying around a sick child? There's no room to check him in at the hospital, and the surgeon is away on a trip, so I was going to take him to another hospital tomorrow. I brought Nam Yi here because I thought that if they saw him, they would take pity on him and let his birth parents know. The agency told me that they aren't allowed to tell me anything. So why are you doing this? Why are you trying to handle this on your own? If there's no room, then find a hospital that has one! Does it make any sense that you are waiting because there is no room? Shouldn't you have gotten help from someone? Get what kind of help from whom? They say there's no other route but transplant surgery. Then, isn't the most important thing to find his birth parents? Who says that transplant surgery is only possible from birth parents? You can just scoure this existence and find a match! Nam, Nam... Oh, Nam! What's the matter? Nam, I'm so sorry! Noona's a fool. A stupid fool. I shouldn't have brought you. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Nam, I'm really really sorry. There, over that way. Here. Nam Yi! We're doing out best, but it's getting worse so quickly, I don't have anything good news for you. Please keep standing by. What am I going to do about our Nam Yi? Nothing's going to happen to our Nam Yi, so don't worry. Nothing's going to happen to him, our Nam Yi. Thanks for doing me this favor, Sunbae. Can you ask your classmates and look into it? Yes. I'll leave it to you, then. Yeah, is this Jun Ho? This is Kang Ha, Won Kang Ha. I have a favor to ask of you. It's not best to drink coffee on an empty stomach, but I know you won't eat even if I tell you to, so drink this. Don't just sit there in a daze. Thank you. Lawyer Won. Isn't today you're engagement? You need to go. I can wait on my own, so go on. [Jung Jae Young] What's going on? Why isn't Kang Ha showing up? What the hell is this? The guests are going to come in any minute now. How are we going to explain if the groom-to-be doesn't show? [Jun Ha] Yeah, Jun Ha. Hyung, where are you right now? Why aren't you here yet? I'm at the hospital right now. I think you're going to have to come. What is this, Hyung? What happened? Nam Yi is very sick. Now, you stay by her side. Jin Pal Gang's little brother is sick, so why are you here. What are you doing here, missing your own engagement?! I don't know... why I'm here, but I just had to be. I couldn't go, leaving that woman alone. Do you hear yourself? Why did you have to stay? What is she, what the hell is that woman to you?! I don't know. What the hell that woman is to me, I don't know either. But, I couldn't leave. When that woman would be here, hurting alone, I couldn't make myself leave to go hold some engagement with you. You can actually say something like that? You jerk. How can you say something like that to me?! How much more pathetic do you have to make me before you're satisfied? How much more pathetic are you going to make me?! It wasn't enough? All that I've gone through wasn't enough, you big jerk?! Let's just get married without the engagement. Is this another handout? You're saying none of it matters as long as you marry me, right? You're saying it doesn't matter how pathetic you make me as long as you marry me, right?! Then what more do you want? That's the only thing I can do. I can let go of the woman I love, but not my little brother. That's why I'm marrying you, isn't it? Then, isn't that enough?! Why am I coming up in that conversation? Why am I coming up in a conversation about your marriage? Why do you have to marry Jae Young because of me? Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Main Translator: meju Timer: avi14 Editor/QC: puela Coordinators: mily2, ay_link Now, you will need to watch over Nam Yi alone, until Jun Ha comes. What are you doing here? What's she supposed to do when you're here? I couldn't stay with her. Can't you stop making me so pathetic? If the 2 of you end like this, I won't ever see you again, Hyung. They were trying to enter China when they were separated. China? The results show that Kim Song Ho is not your father-in-law's grandson. You're sure? Do you know why Team Manager Won got close to me in the beginning? Why couldn't it have been you? It would have been good if it had been you. You're not supposed to come here. Even if I had gritted my teeth and resolved not to come, even if I had vowed not to come, I would have ultimately come.
