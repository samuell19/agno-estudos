That hurts me more than anything. I don't think you understand. I apologise for that, I'm sorry. I didn't expect to like someone. You should give me a kiss. I don't wanna rush into something. I'm very disappointed. How would you feel if she got with someone else? I wouldn't like it. I'm gonna go back to England for a little bit. I think that's probably for the best. I asked you, "Is she the one?" and you said, "She's the one right now." I didn't say that. I'm truly sorry. I probably did say those things. Right. I think you and Mellissa should have a conversation. I would love that. Perfect. You completely embarrassed me. The only reason he was honest is because she was there. Don't get involved. I don't get why there's a big deal about Jamie. It should be what Harry did. I can't have this conversation cos she's so on Jamie's side. I'm not! We are happy together and we are moving forward. Harry, I know. This programme contains strong language and scenes created for entertainment Oh, here she is. Here she is. Here we go again. I don't think you understand. I'm so hung over. I'm still hanging. Yeah, I really don't need this. Cheers, guys. Cheers, mate. Mate, I've never drank so much in my entire life. Oh, God, actually I can't. No. Not feeling that. God, I'm hanging. Where's Melissa, by the way? She's actually having a conversation with Diana. What? Really? Yeah. Is that a good idea? Why? Yeah. Wait, I'm confused. So, what, are they gonna be, like, good friends now? I mean, if they want to be, yeah. Um, I actually spoke to Diana last night, I said, "Look, I'm really sorry for everything that's happened. "I think it's probably a good idea if you and Melissa meet up "and just, sort of, clear the air." Yeah. Well, I hope it's a good idea. I don't always tend to have the best ones. You can say that again! Hello. Hey. How are you? How are you? I'm OK, thank you, how are you? Good, thanks. Good. How have you been? Fine. Yeah? How have you been? Good. Yeah? So, there's much to be discussed, and I'm glad we can finally do that. Yeah, I think we're both on the same page. Like, none of us want it to be awkward. No. And there's no reason for it to be, because you haven't done anything wrong. No. And I don't want you to think that I think that or that I hate you because obviously I don't. No, but I did want to apologise for just causing any grief between you guys, cos that... No, no, it's not your fault. Even if you had slept with Harry, I would never hate you anyway, cos it's not your fault and you don't owe me anything, do you know what I mean? Well, it's a very... I never blame the other girl, ever. Yeah, I mean, it's a very mature way to look at it. Yeah, exactly. So, how have you and Harry been since all of this? Are you guys OK? I mean, like, we're fine, but it's not something that I can just necessarily forget about instantly. But it's more so, like, it's put thorns in everyone else's friendship, because Habbs, for some reason, is just not having my back at all. Right. When I explained that I was upset with Jamie she was like, "Why?" and then having Jamie's back, and then I left the situation, she sort of went in on Harry again. No. And I'm like, "We're trying to, sort of like, get through this. "Why are you... Whose side are you on?" Yeah, it's nice to have support from your friends. Yeah. When she's sat there making digs to my boyfriend and I'm like... Cos you're just sitting there thinking if she's thinking something nasty about it or judging you. Yeah, it's just not nice. It's bad vibes. So, she's now living with Jamie, so I'm not sure if that's why she's suddenly got this clouded mind. I dunno, everyone just bows down to him, like, "Oh, King Jamie." Yeah! Look at this! What do you mean look at this? This is... Look at this. This is what happens every single day. God, I should've moved into this villa earlier. Well, I know, right? So, I've invited Diana over for lunch. OK. Just because I thought it would be a perfect scenario for you guys and me to sit down together and have fun. No, that's fine. We've met, I'm chill. That's fine. Are you chilled? That's absolutely fine. So how come you've decided to come here? Why leave Harry and Melissa? I mean, being with a couple, I don't think anyone should just be with a couple. No, I get it. Firstly, I've never felt so single in my entire life. Yeah. Yeah, especially in the last couple of days. Oh, my God. There's been a lot of lonely meals for one. I'm so sorry you had that, but also, like, how is, how's Melissa doing? Is she OK? I mean, the problem is, is I'm just so worried that I feel like instead of seeing that we're all looking out for her, she's gonna end up pushing us away, and now Melissa hates you, when really the issue is should be with Harry and he's got away scot free. It's just not right. But, that's what I don't get, is that it's like all the blame has been taken off Harry, which I don't understand. Yep. It's painful for me to see him lie to her so well. Like, he's so good at it. He's a master. I've always seen him lie. He's lied about everything. Every single scenario I've ever been with Harry, he's always lied. He lied about, like, texting my ex-girlfriend. He's now lying about this, he's constantly lying, and Harry is gonna fill Melissa's head with so many... Yeah. ..different truths, she's gonna be that everyone else is the enemy. I just, I love Melissa so much, I just don't want her to get hurt. That's where I'm, like, in such a tricky situation, cos I don't wanna get so involved that she ends up resenting me. Yeah. But I don't want her to be with somebody who's gonna lie to her. Tabitha! Tabitha! Darling, this is exhausting. What are you doing? I've never been so fucking exhausted in my life. You're moaning so much. This is like Jumanji. No, it's the best thing for a hangover. Is it fuck?! Woo! That was fun. Funnest thing we've done this trip. Those things are amazing. I feel really embarrassed, I'm not gonna lie. What? I didn't realise it was actually a proper jet. What did you think it was? I thought it was a propeller. Did you think it was some bloke just going... ..swimming really fast? I genuinely thought it was like a propeller, one of those things that a boat has. Ah, so you are just a pretty face? So, no, because I... Shut up! So what happened to you last night? You just seemed to scuttle off. I don't know where you... Mm, I disappeared again. Disappeared again. I know exactly what that means already. I MAY have slept with Tabitha again. Didn't you, like, end or cool things off? Yeah. So, then what you've gone and done is just heat it up again? Bro, what, what are you doing? Make up your mind. Mate, it's hard to say no. There must be something there if you keep ending up in bed with her. I mean, obviously there's something there. There's definitely lust. I just don't know whether there's anything more. But it annoys me cos she is such a sweet girl and so, so lovely and so nice and... I don't know. So, do you think that's it, no more hooking up with her? Er, no, probably will, like, I think after a few drinks anything can happen. Well, not anything. Just you hooking up with Tabitha, yeah. Yeah, just hooking up with Tabitha. It's pretty simple. So, last night Miles was being really flirty, which was annoying cos I'm so over it. Over Miles completely? Completely. Oh, I thought you were gonna tell me that you guys have been banging the whole time we've been away. No, but I was stupid. We were all out, all drinking and I did end up going back to his house... Ah. ..and we kissed, but I stopped him. Kissed? Yeah, yeah, honestly. Hand action? And it could've gone further, but I was just like, "No, I don't wanna do this, I feel really guilty, just..." And, "Stop." You feel guilty? Yeah, because there's a boy that I've been seeing a little bit in London. I was seeing him a bit before I came out here, and we've just carried on talking and this.. Who is this guy? I don't know anything about him. He's young, he's younger, he's a toy boy. OK, well why's he not here? Bring him out. Why can't he come out? I would love him to come out. I think he'd come out. I wanna meet him. Should I invite him? Yeah, I think you should. Do you reckon he'll come? Yeah. Fuck, but the Miles thing though. Are they friends? Do they know each other? I think they know each other. That's slightly more awkward. I know, exactly, but I feel so guilty about kissing Miles the other night. It's only cos I was so drunk. Darling, a kiss is a kiss. You're OK to have a bit of fun during the summer. Yeah, I dunno. It's not as if you've been bonking. So, how are things with you guys? We're fine. I think we're good. Apart from Digby set me up for a fail. What's he done? So, basically I lost a game of volleyball, me against three guys, by the way, by myself. Normally you'd enjoy that. Well, I know, but times have changed. Anyway, I lost and my forfeit is to learn how to dance. They're sending me to a dance class. Oh, God, Liv, you're not gonna feel more awkward. This is gonna be so funny. This is my biggest nightmare. Do you know what it is, right? So, when I was younger my dad said, "To know how to dance you pretend to dry yourself with a towel." So, he said like this. I was like, "I'm not sure about this." "Then you go between the legs" and I was like, "I don't think that's a dance!" That's Bentley on a night out. That one. Oh, look who it is. Hello. Hi, baby. Oh, hello. How was your day date? Please tell me it went well. It was fine. Well, she's smiling. So, are you best friends then? I wouldn't say we're best friends, I just sat her down and I was like, "Look, I don't want you to think I've got an issue with you "just because of what's happened." Yeah. I was like, "Me and Harry are moving on from it, essentially," and she was very supportive, she was really nice. I just think it's really weird that Diana's being a lot more supportive of our relationship than Habbs is. We're happy, we've moved past it, we've addressed the issue, we're moving forward, and she wants to bring us back to the point... But do you not just think she's being protective though? But then I don't understand why, when she knows that we're moving forward and she knows that I dealt with it... Because she wants to know that you are definitely making the right decision, that's what she wants. It's kind of going beyond the point of being protective now cos it's getting to a point where I'm like, "I don't wanna really necessarily go out for dinner when you're there "if you're just gonna keep making sly digs." It's not that I don't wanna be friends with her, but I don't want to be... You don't need it. I don't need that when I'm trying to deal with this, do you know what I mean, and we're trying to move on from it and it's like she doesn't want us to. Until she drops it, I don't really wanna be around her. It's draining. I bet you didn't know this about me. Go on, what? I know how to do a silver service. Look at you go. So, hold on. You probably need some bread as well. Yeah. Yeah, you nearly got it. There you go, that's silver service. Amazing, I can tell that you clearly worked as a waiter for five years. Ah, hi guys. Oh, hey! Hello. Come sit. Come relax. How are you? What would you like to eat? I would love some salad with apples. Look at this. Don't worry about it. How are you, my darling? Yeah. Um, I just had drinks with Melissa. Oh, really? Yeah. And it seems like we've hashed everything out. Really? Yeah, and it's good. I mean, her situation with Harry is her situation with Harry. Sure. It's their relationship, this is what I said to Melissa. You know, if you choose to forgive him and move forward and just have it be water under the bridge, then that's really up to you. But between me and her, we're fine, and we actually had a lovely time. I'm really glad. Right guys, I'm gonna go make a coffee, does anyone want one? Er, sure roomie. I'm OK, thank you. Okie-doke. See you later, roomie. See you later. We're roommates now. I've heard, how is it? Good, man. It's a bit awkward for me as I said I was with Melissa earlier... Yeah. ..and she feels a bit unsupported the way Habbs has been towards her and Harry, and... It's horse shit. She feels like Habbs will just listen to anything you say. Is that what she said? Yeah. And she calls you King Jamie. Ridiculous. Yeah. This whole thing, what pisses me off more than anything is that Melissa is now turning her back on Habbs. It's, like, ridiculous, it's like she's being poisoned. The real story is what Harry did in Vegas and lied about it. Right. And Harry is making Melissa be nice to you because it's the typical thing, keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. So, he's gonna keep you as close as possible and then the issue becomes me and Habbs and everything else is forgotten. Honestly, now that you've put it that way I can really see it that way. I think it's ridiculous. I don't mind them turning on me, but when they turn on Habbs, then I have a serious problem with it, I really do. This is embarrassing, and I don't know why you're making me do it. You're great. Spin around. No, no, no, no. Oh. I was actually quite impressed. I'm proud of, you, babe. That was horrible. I think you're a bit wooden. Ollie, I'm not... It was a bit rigid. Pretty scary. Your resting bitch face whilst... You were just looking like... That's not even resting, that's just normal. Oh, is that...? OK. Yeah. Livid. I just think next time you should be doing more of an Argentinian tango. What? I think once you loosen up, you're quite the dancer. We actually owe you, er, an applause. I think you did very well. I thought you were going to say an apology. And an apology. Yeah, I think that's right. No, no, no, don't... No, don't back down. Don't you pipe up for one second! Yeah, shut up, Digby! I've got serious leg pain after both of these. Have you injured yourself? I'm not surprised, the things you were performing. Yeah, I thought it was all right yesterday, I was hiking with Tabitha and that was completely unacceptable. Oh, my God, also, you'll never guess what, this is amazing. You know Tabitha, Miles, all this situation that's going on? She turned around and said she's actually been seeing someone at home. She's seeing this guy before she left and, and she, kind of, had this on the back burner for a while and then suddenly she goes, "You know what, I think I really like him." That's quite interesting, cos Miles did sleep with Tabitha the other night. What? Yeah. Did he? She said they just kissed. We thought they kissed. She slept with Miles, like, the other day. Did they sleep together properly? Yeah. Who's the guy? We don't know. This random guy she's keeping very quiet. I'm quite intrigued to know who it is. I said, "Bring him out." I said, "We need to meet this guy," cos we don't know who this guy is. Let's introduce him to Miles. Let's introduce him... Well, let's not do that immediately. I think, I think maybe... I think that's, kind of, up to her. I just hope for whoever it is, she's honest with the guy. Oh, God. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, that looks delicious. You know, I like doing this because this is... Cos Ell's not here... I know. You're, like, now my compadre up here. I love that. How are you feeling now Ell's gone? Are you missing her? Do you know what it is, I do, I really miss her, but at the same time it's like if you... I think in a relationship, if you're constantly with each other the entire time, then you lose that kind of spark. I so agree. So it's quite nice having that back and forward a little bit, you know what I mean...? Hi, there, can I get a table for two please? Yeah, follow me, please. Melissa and Harry. Thank you. Why aren't they coming over? Thank you. It's a bit awkward. Great restaurant choice. So awkward. Normally I'd go over and say hello, but because Jamie's there I'm a bit... I can't. So, Diana said that Melissa has a problem with you. With me? With you, yeah. What? Why? She said, she said things like, um... Melissa or Harry? No, Melissa has a problem with you. What? Why? This comes from Diana. Melissa said that you haven't been a true friend to her and, er, that you're just, like, listening to what I'm saying and she's pissed off at you because you don't have her back. I just, I'm actually so shocked. Like, the whole reason I'm saying it, if I was a shit friend, I'd just be like, "Oh, ignore it, let him do that." I just don't want her to be fucked over. It's so annoying that just because I'm not supporting what she's saying or what he's saying that it's going to affect my friendship with her. It's the last thing I want. I literally was saying it because I love her so much. Just realise from your own self esteem, that you are a fricking good mate, we all know how loyal you are towards Melissa and loyal in that sense, and her saying that is just another situation where Harry has managed to get his claws in there and turn it around somehow. It's really upset me. Yeah, I can imagine. I do think it's a bit strange they're now all so pally-pally all of a sudden. I think it's since she's moved into that villa and since Jamie's girlfriend's gone home... No, I'm joking. Er, yeah. Anyway, let's, er, not let that dampen our day. What do you fancy ordering? Pasta. Do you? Yeah. Oh, there he is! Mitty boy. How are you? Whoa, dancing in. Dancing in. You good? Yeah. Um, first of all, why are you late? Because I've been dancing obviously. Wait, did you have the forfeit with Liv? It was really funny. I mean, she was, she was better than I was expecting. A little stiff at first, but we managed to loosen her up. We were having a little chat whilst we were mid break, er, whilst we were dancing. Yeah. Talking about Tabitha. Oh, Tabitha. She's, er... Why have you got a smile on your face? I dunno. She's, she's got some, she's got some love back in the UK. Wait, she's got some love back in the UK? Mm, apparently you weren't number one. You're kidding me. You're just a piece of holiday meat. Wait, how long has this been going on for? Because you do know that me and Tabitha slept together the other day. Mm, I know. I guess for you, you want to know whether you're a plan A or plan B. Yeah. Was it...? You might've been plan B. Was she like, was she like, "OK, it might not work with this "guy in London, Miles is here, I'll have a bit of fun with him. "And if it doesn't work with Miles I can go back to my plan A?" Probably. That kind of sounds like it. Oh. Do you feel a bit used? The thing is, she's the one who wanted to hook up with me, she's the one who kept on texting me, like, wanting to see me. Like, she was full-on, and that's one of the reasons why I kind of broke it off with her. I honestly felt so bad, I felt like the, you know, the villain, and she made me feel a bit, kind of like, shit, I've really hurt her. So, that, kind of, annoys me. I kind of think that's kind of taking the piss. Maybe she's just confused. Maybe she did start to get some emotion for you, but she also had feelings for this dude back in the UK. I think it's a bit disrespectful. I wouldn't have done that to her. I feel like she's just done that stereotypical thing of having her cake and eating it. Like, she obviously wanted a, a slice of you and she took it, but she's also got a cake back at, back at home in the UK, a cake that might be coming out here. Might be coming out here? Mm. You think that you would... If you did see him, you'd tell him what happened? Yeah, course I would. Course I would. Obviously she's been lying to me, lying to him. She wants to play this game, we can play it. Game on. Mm, game on. Hi. Hi, babe. I can't believe you're here. It's actually mental. I never... Look at your hair. Do you like it? Yeah. I've missed you so much. Me too. You look so gorgeous. Thanks. Thank you for inviting me, baby. That's OK. I only invited you yesterday, I'm happy you got here so quickly. I know. I just couldn't wait any longer. I know. I'm glad we've been talking though. Very glad. We've been talking a lot. Every single day. Yeah, every... I feel like I have a girlfriend. You do? Mm. Is that a good thing? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. OK. Definitely. Yeah, it's nice. So, who else is out here? Tell me. Er, I'm in a house with Ollie Locke. Yeah. And Liv and Digby. Digby. Yeah. And who else is here? Who else is here? Alex Mitton's out here and Jamie is out here. Good. And then Habbs is here and Miles is here as well. Miles, great. Yeah. How's he doing? He's fine. Yeah. He's probably the one person out here who I just have no interest in spending time with. I know, we don't have to hang out with him though. Good, perfect. We're here now. Let's go over right now, let's go and talk to them and sort this whole thing out for now. Come on, cos it's, it's ridiculous. OK, let's do it. OK, come on. Hello. Hey. Hey. How are you? Good. Good, thank you. You all right? Yeah, no, I'm good. I just, I've been hearing that, like, you've got a big problem with me, so... What? I heard that you were, like, saying that I wasn't a very loyal friend and that I don't have a voice for myself. Who have you heard that from? Er, Diana. That has completely been taken out of context, it's not how I said it at all. She was like, "How are you and her?" And I was like, 'We're getting there, we're getting there, "but it's difficult when I've got, no offence, you, like, "putting a shitter on it, which is what I felt you were doing." I was just being honest. And then I was like, "It's difficult when I don't feel like I've got full support from my bestmate." I just feel like, I dunno, like we're trying to move on from it and you just keep shittingon it. That's how I feel when you do, like, say digs and stuff... To you? Well, to Harry, and it's just like a bit like, "Oh." But that's my opinion, I'm sorry you feel like that, I am. But do you know what I mean, it makes it feel like you're, "Melissa's a fucking mug." I'm just like, "Oh, my God, it's just shitting on it even more, like, "who am I supposed to turn to now?" I don't... But in the same breath you go back to her like, "Oh, I love you guys, I love you and Harry." Yeah, so I'm so confused. No, I love Melissa. What's your prob... What's your issue with me then? This is her best mate, of course she's going to have an issue with you. Of course she is. It's only natural to do that. I don't get it. Yeah, fair enough, but they were friends as well. I've never done anything against you. You've seen how apologetic and how sorry that I've been with the situation. But I also see... You see how happy I make Melissa. But I also, I see how easy you lie to her and you're really good at it and it worries me. That's all I've said and I've said the exact same thing to you. Well, if it worries you, it worries you. That's your issue, that's your problem. Well, there you go, so let's leave it as having an issue. Do you actually have a problem with me or are you just being manipulated by other people? Harry, I... You are... It's hard to say, because every... I don't want to upset Melissa and my friendship... Just be honest with me, if you have a problem with me, say it. Well, clearly we're not the bestest of friends. Great, but then just be honest about it. I have. She is being honest. I've never had an issue with you. I think you're a lovely girl. No, I felt like that... I think he's a bit of an arsehole, but... We're trying to move forward and people aren't letting us. Everyone else should just let us be. I'll leave you guys to have your dinner and we'll go. ♪ I look into her eyes ♪ Her eyes that never judge... ♪ And step one, two, three, four.

She has kept this very quiet, by the way. We were all stunned when we heard. Really? Who did you think it was? I had no idea, definitely not you! Honestly! I know. Well, I've been keeping it, like, my little secret, because in London... Your dirty little secret. I'm your little secret, am I? Yeah, cos when we were in London, we were seeing each other, it got quite full-on quite quickly, but then it was always in the back of my mind that I was going to be going away, but I've just been thinking about him the whole time. And then when I was... The other day, I was talking to Ollie about him and Ollie was like, "If you really like this guy, and you clearly do, "just invite him out here." Um, yeah, and now you're here. This is amazing. I think this is marvellous. Sly Tabitha. I know. Keeping things quiet. Do you keep many other secrets? No, no, I'm very honest. No? OK. Just you. Just me. Mm-hm. That's good.

So how are things with you? Yeah, really good, mate. How did the dancing go with Liv? Oh, mate, it was so good. You missed out big time. We made her do a traditional Croatian dance lesson. Oh, mate. It was so good. Hopefully, she can embrace it now. Next time we're out, she'll have to show us some of those moves. Literally, we'll force her. Um... but, yeah, how are things between you and, um, Habbs, mate? It's just gone quite strange. Like, Melissa and I actually bumped into her and Jamie yesterday. Yeah? And she's now basically voicing that she's got a problem with me, which I think is really hard for Melissa. I mean, she's saying that I'm an arsehole. Really? Yeah. I mean, she's one to fucking talk. Like, she'll just go whichever way the wind will blow. She actually called you an arsehole? She called me an arsehole. That's really childish. Am I an arsehole? No, mate. I know, I know I can be... Like I've probably done things that... Oh, you CAN be an arsehole, yeah. ..probably have been arsehole-worthy. Like, granted, I'd call myself an arsehole for what's happened. But when you apologise for something and move forward... And you've admitted it as well. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. No, I mean... Obviously, mate, that is childish. But, mate, from past experience, obviously what happened back in London with me and everything, I-I found when your friends get involved in your relationship, it really does fuck with everything. It really... I don't think it does. Mate, trust me, my girlfriend broke up with me because of the influence her friends had. Well yeah, if, if Habbs keeps on going down the road of... of trying to plant that seed of doubt and keeps.. And won't let this go, essentially... Yeah. ..then I will tell her to shut the fuck up. Like... Because she needs to. MUSIC: Coma by Le Boom So you're the mystery man? You're the toy boy? What do you mean, "the toy boy"? So, basically Tabitha has been hiding a lover, and it's this guy.

I just want to really get to know her more. And what's her chat been like to you? Has she been saying for ages how much she likes you and all that? She says it to me the whole time. Are you going to make it official? Are you going to...? It's on the road to that, but I would love her to be my girlfriend, but we'll see. I like this. That's beaut. Mm. Yeah. I'm going to go grab a drink. OK, see you in a bit. Is that legit? That's actually pretty heavy. But I thought Tabby slept with Miles. Yeah, they did. The other day. They did, yeah. Yeah. I wonder if she's going to be honest with him. She's got to be, surely. Surely Miles is going to say something. Yeah, she has to. Actually, I did speak to Miles and he was coming tonight. No! Yeah. LAUGHING: Oh, my God. Can I get a vodka and orange soda, please? Have you spoken to Melissa today? No, I haven't heard from her, actually. I know, it's... Has she not messaged you or anything like that or spoken to you? No, nothing. OK. It's just so... I just don't know what to do. Like, I almost feel like I shouldn't... I shouldn't have even said anything, but I can't lie to her and be like, "I think he's great." Well, I think you're just being a good friend. Like, you need, like, honesty. If you were to go, "Oh, yeah, he's amazing," like, that's bullshit. At least you're being truthful. And she, at some point, will realise that. Cheers, mate. Thank you. Hello. Ah. What are you doing in Croatia? I'm here to see Tabitha. No way. Yeah, yeah. OK. How's that going? It's going good. That's good. I'm... Well, I'm glad for you, for you two, I think it's... It's a good thing. I'm very glad you're happy for me. I'm... I mean, sorry, I'm a bit shocked to see you. It's just a bit... I mean... Sorry, I just find it a little bit funny, just because, I mean - what, two nights ago? - she was in my bed. This week? Yeah. We, like... Yeah, we slept together. Like, it's... I just find it a bit comical, to be honest. And are you getting pleasure from this, from telling me this? Well, right now... ..um, a little bit. I just find it hysterical. I mean, it's bad. I think she's taking the piss out of you. Look, you don't have to believe me, and you have no reason to. I mean, I don't believe a word you're saying. It's also the fact you're telling me this is pissing me off. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm the guy. This is the fucking darkest thing in the world. MUSIC: Love Lights by Sunset Sons Can I ask you a question? I've got a problem. What? I've got these lumps here and I don't know what they are. What? Are you sure? I don't see any lumps. It's quite flat to me. These lumps. I don't see any lumps. There's six lumps on either side. Shall I go to hospital? You might have to. There's no lumps from where I'm standing. There are, look. There's none. Nope. Put your hand across them like that. Feel that. Smooth. Actually quite round. No, it's not, it's lumpy. Squishy, right? Yeah, it's quite soft, that's it. It's lumpy. Soft and lumpy. I don't get it. You guys both look great. So do you. So do you, man. Thank you. I'm really happy you guys made it. I love that you threw a party for us, this is so kind of you. Yeah, well, I figured after everything it'd be nice to kind of get everyone together. For sure. I did wanna say that I invited Harry and Melissa, so if that's gonna be awkward between you guys, I don't know. How are you guys feeling? I mean, it's not awkward at all. The only thing that's... well, I mean, it is a little bit awkward... The only thing that's awkward is that normally, I'd run up and give her a hug, but it's like we're seeing each other and we've not really... and probably I should go up, but there's two and then it's me and I'm just - you know, Harry's stood there. Do you think you'll speak about it with her today? I really want to, cos I just do not - I don't want our friendship to end over this. It's just so silly and it's such a shame and I do love her, so I'm gonna go and talk to her today about it. Normally I'd be with Habbs, but she won't even look me in the eye. I've tried to make conversation, it's so awkward. It's so weird. I know she's looking at us like, "Oh, my God, I hate him". Mm. I think in her mind it's honestly, she thinks it's coming from a good place and it's just not. Mate, I don't think it is. You think she just hates you. I think she's got a huge problem with me. I know, I think she hates you as well. Yeah, I agree. And she won't be happy unless you do what she wants you to do. I know, that's what it feels like, doesn't it? Do you want to break up with me? No, of course I don't, but you know what's so bad? It's making me feel like... I shouldn't be with you, almost. It's making me feel uncomfortable to be with you. Like, I feel like I'm gonna give you a kiss and, "Oh, fuck, I can't do that cos she's looking". It's like a horrible feeling. Well, the fact that you're feeling like that and she's the one that's making you feel that way, should you be friends with someone like that? It just makes me not wanna, like, I don't know, it makes me really upset, cos I love her, but... Honestly, that really, really pisses me off. It doesn't feel good. What she's doing and what she's saying is pushing you further away from me, it's pushing us apart and I want to say to her that... No, I don't want you to say anything to her. It needs to be me. MUSIC: Down To Be Loved by Raphael Lake and Aaron Levy Do you quite like pool parties? I do love a good pool party. Lot of flesh. No. Do you think, because you're quite into, um, physique and stuff, that when you look around at other people's bodies, you can tell if they work out? Probably, yeah. Like a girl's arse. No, I don't look at girls' arses. Do you know if she's done squats? No. Well, yeah, I can tell if she's done squats. So you do look at girls' arses? No, I don't, but I can tell. Do you think Diana's got a good bum? I haven't looked. You have, Digby, I've caught you creeping on her arse. I haven't. All right, Pinocchio. Baby, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to have an argument? I weirdly quite enjoy arguing with you. I was actually talking about it yesterday with Ollie. Yeah? And he was saying we do, like, bicker. It worries me that you're saying you enjoy it. But we're together non-stop, do you know what I mean? Yeah. That's probably, as well, why we argue. But I just wanna make... you know, are you happy? Yes, obviously. You are happy? What is going on here? Ah. Hello. What are you guys doing? How are we, boy? How are you, buddy? Mitt, how are we, buddy? Good. Found out who Tabitha's mystery man was. Oh, my God, how exciting is that? His best mate, Sam Prince. My best friend. I couldn't believe it. When he showed up I was like, "Oh, my God, it's him". So funny, because we went out last night and I just see, like, this man at the bar. I was like, "Wait, that's not a man, that's a little boy". So I... Aw. Oh, sorry. Bitchy. There he is. Little bitchy. I go over to him, he's like, "I'm here to see Tabitha". So I start laughing a little bit. So you told Sam Prince that? I took it upon myself to go, "Look, Princey, I've kind of hooked up with, apparently, your new bird". What was his reaction when you said you'd been... Probably fucking livid. He didn't really take that well. As funny as it may be for you, and you do have this issue, like, you and Princey have this thing, for him it's actually probably quite gutting. I don't care for Sam. We're not friends, at the end of the day. The thing is, you've gotta remember that you don't have any feelings involved in any of this. However, Sam obviously does. Mate, why is the history so bad between you two? Um... Miles jumped on Princey's ex. That is why they have issues. Oh, God. So do you see what I mean? It's like a recurring issue. Yeah, but I've done nothing wrong. Yeah. I hooked up with a girl who supposedly was single, but apparently not. You're two guys just being played. Yeah, course we are. You've both been played at the same game. Yeah. And I think Princey needs to see that. But Tab needs to be honest with Princey first. She won't be. I doubt that Tabitha's gonna try and lie and say that... No, no. No, Tabs... She will lie. She'll try to lie. She lied to me. It's so obvious that you slept together. I don't understand why you would. She will lie. She will 100% lie. I feel like getting drunk today. Yeah, let's definitely have a few glasses. It's with the kind of summer vibes. Yeah. Very nice. How's everything going with Princey? So good. Yeah? I'm just so happy that he's out here. Um, it's, um... Hello. Hello. Hi, how are you doing? I'm all right, mate, how are you? Good to see you. Hi. Hi. We need to have a chat. Yeah? Yeah, I think you've got some explaining to do. Apparently, you slept with Miles three days ago. No. No, that's not true. So Miles is lying? No, I... we did kiss, and I did go back to his house. Nice. I think you guys need to have this discussion, just the two of you. OK, thanks, Ols. And I'm just so desperately sad that I didn't tell you myself. I should've told you as soon as it happened. I feel like I've cheated. It was just horrible, cos I've never cheated on anyone before. It's really horrible. And he's lying, 100%? Lying about what? That we slept together three days ago? Yeah. Yes, 100%, that didn't happen. OK. Promise. I do promise. The thing is, I'm pissed off with Miles too, if he is lying. Yeah. He's right behind you, by the way. Hey, guys. Hi. Hey. How's this lovely couple doing? So Tabitha's telling me that you didn't sleep together three days ago. Oh, really? Yeah. We didn't sleep this week? No, we didn't sleep together. OK. That's a lie. We got together and I stayed at your house and we were in bed together. And we didn't... We didn't sleep together. Tabitha, you're lying. No, I'm not lying. She's lying to you. She's lied to you all this trip. What's the point of lying? If you're just honest... I'm not lying. That's the thing. You are, Tabitha. God, Jesus, I wish... I respect honesty. If you tell me, then we can just... it may be fine. I'm not gonna say something happened when it didn't happen. We did. We did sleep together. OK, just pipe down. You're 100% certain? Yes. 100%. Look, I just... What other secrets are there? Is there anyone else? No, come on, obviously not. Look, I want to move forward with Sam and I don't - and I just, I'd really like it if you'd just let us do that and just... Um, I really wouldn't... I don't really care any more. Also, sorry, I should give these back to you, cos you left those on my mantelpiece. Oh, thank you. Blimey. Have you got any other of her possessions? I could check. Obviously not. My earrings came off when I went there that night. To be fair, you do have more to gain to lie, and just seeing that, I just don't, I don't understand what you're playing at. I don't really wanna talk to you, so... Oh, God, don't worry about it. Fuck me, you're a really good liar. Hey, Habbs. Hi, Harry. How are you? Yeah, I'm good. Good. Um, I'm glad we've bumped into each other here. Yeah. Um, I feel the other day you were extremely inappropriately confrontational. Really? Yeah, and I don't really know why. I mean, you called me an arsehole whilst Melissa and I were sat having lunch. Like... Well, I felt like you kept probing me and kept calling me up and saying, "Why have you got an issue with me?" and that was just aggravating the whole situation. That wasn't the situation, to begin with. That is the situation, because I love Melissa and my friendship's with her. Mm. And I saw you lie to her in such a calm and collected way, and I'm not gonna lie, that freaked me out. Did Jamie tell you to say that? No! What is this? Look, the situation is that I am being truthful about how I feel. I don't like liars, I don't like how you calmly lie. So you think I'm an arsehole for lying? Yeah, I think you are an arsehole for lying. Do you think Sam's an arsehole for lying? Yeah, he's absolutely an arsehole for lying. How are things with you and him at the moment? I have no idea. He's in England. And you haven't spoken to him? Mm, on and off, he texted me today saying he was coming back. Yeah? And how does that make you feel? Like, do you... Just to put it out there, if I were to ever go back there, which I don't know whether I am, I don't know whether we'll move on as friends or whatever, I have absolutely no idea, I would expect all of you guys, as my friends, to be like, "He fucked you over, don't go there." But the thing is, I wouldn't have an opinion on it. But even if you did, Harry, I'd be like, "Thanks, mate, you've got my back". But how have you had Melissa's back? How have you supported Melissa? I'm true to myself, and if I have an issue with somebody, I have an issue with them. I don't have an issue with somebody just cos my best friend's got an issue with them. So you won't have your friend's back. Of course I'll have her back. But you haven't been supportive. If you had, we wouldn't be in this position right now. It's awful. It's upsetting. Well, yeah, it is upsetting for everybody, but I don't really... What's going on here? Well, clearly, I'm a really shit friend, so we're just discussing that. I haven't said that. It's like, for me, it's confusing, because you're saying that you support my decision and you support us, but then you say to Harry at the table, "Oh, you're a fucking arsehole". That's not... Because - and look, I'm not perfect, I shouldn't have said it, obviously I shouldn't have said it, it's rude, it's not great, I shouldn't have done it. But it's still the fact that you think it that upsets me. Do you understand? Watching me, I don't feel like I can kiss and hug him, cos I have you staring at me and I'm like, "She fucking hates that". I'm not staring at you. No, but I feel like you hate us. I don't hate you. This is where it's all got misconstrued. He fucked you over and I saw him lie to you, and for me, I stayed in a villa with you and I saw you lie to her, like, so much, and it freaked me out. And I have said sorry for that. And then it's upsetting for me to be told that you're going round saying I'm a shit friend. I haven't said you're a shit friend once. I said I don't know where this leaves us in terms of a friendship, because I can't be around you if you're gonna constantly, like, say, "You're a fucking arsehole", things like that to Harry. I don't understand how we're gonna move forward. All I ever wanted to be was, like, a loyal friend to you and support you... so I'm sorry you feel that way. Yeah! How are you, man? Hello! I got a message from Habbs's ex-boyfriend with screengrabs of messages that she'd sent him while we were in Croatia. I feel as though you've massively dodged a bullet. I am really sorry, my feelings have massively changed. I have spoken to Habbs and... So now you've formed this little hate club, that's really cute. And you can both just fuck off. I feel so humiliated. Everyone's saying, "Don't go there with Tabitha". Well, that's really mean and I'm telling you that I won't hurt you. I can't apologise for the shit you feel. That isn't good enough. I don't care if it's not good enough for you. I mean, that's not what friends do. Harry, I don't care. Well, that's not what friends do, mate. Like, Digby's like, "Oh, I know I'll marry you, have kids together", but I don't know if that is what I want. I guess I just don't know where I stand, babe. I think you love me more than I love you.
