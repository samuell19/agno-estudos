M @ X Subtitling Kavisha Gayanath M @ X RABID Why do we repeat old tendencies? - Shit! Why do we give new life to old things? Do we add something new? Because without soul can not be life. Are we following the masses? Or we do art for the few who dare to get involved? well well well. What's your excuse this time ... to disrupt the flow of energy throughout our day, breaking whenever you fancy? Rose Miller! I speak to you, okay? You interrupt my day and not say anything in your defense? I almost had an accident and ... I do not want to hear any excuses of shit! Just come to work on time. You think it's funny? "Schadenfreude". Joy is the misfortune of others. Thank you my dear Rose. Quiet, just wanted to clarify something. It's okay. Draw near to me. There is someone in each of us that do not want to show the world. Someone who feels joy when one of us fails. A black passenger who wants to survive at any price. This is human psychology, huh? And that expresses my new collection. The dark side of the soul. That's joy. Gunter need these skins for tonight. All right. Thank you, Aurora. Put all the body on the table. Hi, Rose. I have an idea. You're going to the show, right? I have to - Would you go to a party later? Have fun, let off steam. No. That? - I think it's wasting time. Yeah, well you network, that's important, but I do not know. I prefer to let my talk work itself. While obviously not say anything. That? - Be my date tonight. That? It does not have to be formal. I just want to see you. It's okay? Yes, sure. - Good. See you later. Hey, Rose, can you do it tougher for me? I need a smaller size, it sounds ridiculous. Chels going to be really ridiculous. I see myself thin makes you feel good. Well, just as products natural and I feel great. I do not understand how you can live this way. It could never be vegetarian. Seriously, how do you live without bacon? - I do not want to suffer any animal. You do not mind eating something that is dead? Or eat, or eat you. What do you eat then? Everything organic as possible, B12 supplement for energy. Many meat eaters eat very little B12. That's the important thing. Rose, I'm starting to live, I'm worried about you. Will you go with me to the party? Really I wanted to go. Brad asked. Really? It was time! It's nothing special, we will be there. But he says I'm his appointment. My God, Rose! That's great for you! What will you wear? Only this. No. No? Do not tell anyone, or joke. I'll think something. It will be very fun and you'll look sexy. Ross? - No, name: Rose. Name: Miller. And you're on the list? I guess, I did it myself. Hi dear. It's okay? Good. Rose Miller Rose Miller. Here you are. To a good time. - Yes. Misses. - Thank you. Hey, Rose! Apology? - There is a lot of noise here. Come on. It's better? - Yes. You look terrible. - Yes thanks. You look ... you look good. Shit! You do not want to greet Gunter? - No not really. Otherwise, you would be ashamed in front of him. Good and? It's a temporary job. I'll become a photojournalist. This is totally stupid or not, but does not pay well, so I will. It's better than weddings. Can I ask why photojournalist? Yeah, you know, for me the true beauty in things, There are still undiscovered. I want to share discoveries, be part of history. You want to be part of something bigger? What you really want? You know, I work in fashion. - Yes, but what 's next? Shit, I ... - Okay. No matter. It was embarrassing. - Was nothing. Uh, no offense, but why you want to work in fashion? I love the feeling it conveys clothes. Can be and become who you want, transform. Clothing you is like an armor, you know? Get ready and leave the house. I designed to help people, give them the feeling of strength. It 's stupid, I know. You were right. - No. Yes it is. - Not at all. What you just said, you have to tell Gunter. Come on. Nerd . - Yes. No I can not. - You can do it. I will go with you. Really I can not. - He loves me. The dress is from her collection. You should not use it at all. That? - Yes. Does this dress is Gunter? - I will kill me. Again. You're full of secrets. - Yes. Still there? No, your secret is safe with me. Where are my manners? Do you want a drink. - Sure. What do you want? - No matter. Surprise me. I thought I had done. I'll be right back. Did you see that? Rose Miller with Brad Hart? OMG. How I could overlook Scarface? I can not believe it's real! Chels asked Brad to go out with her. Really? - Yes. Chels does everything for her. Why? I have no idea, Chels family took over Rose or something. She lost her family in a car accident. Look at his face, it must have been serious. Brad, sorry for him. He is very friendly. - Chelsea are very friendly. I do not understand what Rose, she's so sad and strange. So you think Brad throws it out of pity? OMG! Something like that. He pulled them all. Ready to go? - Yeah right. C'mon C'mon. All right. Let's go to the party. My God, Rose. You look good. - Did you fix this with Brad? Shit, who betrayed me? - God, I feel humilllada. Why did I do this to me? Like and was crazy about this. But I'm very happy. - That's not what I meant. How then, Chels? I do not want you to help me. I do not want to be here. I do not want more handouts from you, okay? - What are you talking about? You're my family, do not! I only wanted to help you! Rose! ¡Rose! Rose! Shit! Dr. Bruce, in obstetrics, please. Dr. Bruce. Rose? God, Rose! Can anyone come? Everything is fine. Stay still. Doctor? She woke up! Nurse? Hey Hey hey.

With proper nutrition, you can lead a completely normal life, despite the shortened body. We only see Chelsea Cottrell as an emergency contact. It's me. His parents are dead. We were his adoptive family. Well well. It is important for her to receive the greatest possible encouragement. I want to see Really sure. But keep in mind that it is a long process.

All good? I'm a monster You are alive. That is the most important. What about work? I'm sorry Rose. The competition is too strong. But, hey ... Gunter will not charge you dress. Rose, you're like a sister. I know you want to be alone, and certainly you're right. But I will not go. I know I did wrong, but I'll fix it. I did not know where to put your things, so I brought them . You know the apartment is huge. You can not be alone right now. Sweetie! Hey, honey, hey, hey. Everything will be fine, okay?

Rose, I think about you all the time. Invitation to our clinic. CLINIC Burroughs Transhumanism. Belief or theory that man is aware of ... their physical and mental limits current can develop. Especially through science and technology. The term "Transhumanism" comes from an essay ... of the Canadian philosopher WD Lightfall of 1940. In 1957 he used the biologist Julian Huxley ... as the title of an essay different on the subject. Today is considered the founder of the movement. He argued that the human species, if desired, you can cross borders. Not only sporadically as individual in one way or another, but in its entirety, as humanity. Despite the clear advantages of the movement, any progress was held back by restrictions ... health authority. Clinic Burroughs, however, saw an opportunity in this challenge. In exchange for some analyzes of blood, families ... attend Burroughss tests for medical care for life. This includes the treatment of special cases. with medical innovations, that they are not available to the public so far. We hope to hear. I get involved in very sick things for free treatment here.

The procedure is not new, but it is the key to life. I can not afford that. We assume all the costs. If you are eligible. And as I see it , you meet all requirements. We live in a country that ... neglects care health of its citizens. We are a research institution. A major in the re-generative medicine, and we need test subjects. That is for mutual benefit. It is safe? Would not be our first patient, not last. In my opinion, there are only bureaucratic formalities ... that prevent ... such life - changing therapies are available to all. The rich have benefited for a long time about it. Okay, discuss it with tranquility. I wait outside. Pretty good, right? Pretty shitty . The hospital has charged you large sums, Do you know the prices for plastic surgery? How can these people sleep peacefully? I'm scared I know it's unfair, Rose. But, honestly, what have you got to lose? I'm sorry. Come here, honey. We found a solution. Do it. Let me see. You are his friend. That? Oh, no. But it is important to me. - Very affectionate. Tell me a little about it? Insurance. ... I want as little as pernicious anemia. The word "vampire" is not heard here with us. We strive for a better picture. "Correlation" is the key word. free correlation of prejudice. Life in all its rich variety. Take something and leave something.

Our inner truth, our longings. Our fears. Were you in the water? - Yes, I was. In dreams, water symbolizes our feelings. Immersion in water means that you explore your unconscious. Get to know you better, gain more self - esteem. This dream is beautiful. I also know him. But sleep is important. Do not you work too much. That would affect how your mind processes information. Then you feel like in a dream awake. Your body had a lot of stress. This can cause fainting. Honestly, I feel good. Very strong, even. - Fantastic. Does that mean I'm going home? Absolutely. Make an appointment to document how will the cure. Of course. - Signing the agreement when you leave. There may be one or another effect side, I must mention. What we use are basically grafts of skin imperishable. These medications help to a smoother transformation. But sleep when you're tired. Otherwise, they can cause nausea, dizziness and even hallucinations very real. A change in diet is inevitable. Drink this if you do not bring food normally you. What exactly is there? - A super protein. Easy to digest and especially tailored to your nutritional needs. It is completely harmless. - Thank you , Dr. Burroughs. Always she smiles, Rose. Hi.

Oh, I still can not remove the bandage! His face is very swollen. I can not yet say how it will look to the end. What's going on here? He bit me! He bit me! He bit me! You did well to come here for that. Tell me about your desire for meat. Not only meat, also the blood. Basically blood. Patients often report a change in their sense of taste. This is a side effect of anesthesia. Some things taste very different. We develop a desire for the unknown. What's your appetite? - I'm always hungry. Vomiting all the time. I have these strong stomach pains. And when the pain becomes too strong, I have hallucinations and see ... Please! Miss Miller? ... drinking blood. - What you dream. I know it looks real, but it is not. Listen, research of dreams is still in its infancy. But one thing we know, the time we dream, our soul healthy. Why dream of drinking blood? To dream of drinking blood is about unfulfilled yearnings. Your desire triggers guilt. - Do not feel guilty. You have control dreams or is the other way around? Sometimes I control. And sometimes it seems to me I'm looking at myself. I am, but I'm someone else. These nightmares ... - Hallucinations. They make me feel like I'm becoming a monster. Well, unfortunately I have to disappoint you . Your monster is psychological. Like most monsters. Is your creation. Not recognize your reflection, then you see a monster. When will stop this dissociative disorder? When I feel like myself again? That depends on you, Rose. We see what we want to see. And there are things that we refuse to see. But we create our own reality, Rose. And also we are who we influence it. There you are, Rose Miller. - I am sorry for being late. Silly stuff! What have we here? No, these ... Who drew this? Your? Yes. They are not yet finished. I 'll show later. But already they made. So ... you serious or is the Schadenfreude? I... Nerd. This is Schadenfreude. My job is... Yes Yes. For my collection.

What we have here is the supposed case first reported. Dominic Danvers. What is your condition? Not good at all . We need to know what bit him. Still you're avoiding me? - No, I'm just busy. I had some more tests. - You're good? If everything is fine. In fact, I just came from the clinic. ¿Burroughs? What did he say? I should be more patient. Did he say anything else? - You should eat regularly. So I have to buy you lunch. I fell into the trap, right? - as he planned. Y? Do you have appetite? - I am insatiable. I have literally always hungry. All I have are the protein shakes clinic. Then let me order. What would you like to eat? I'm not sure. My stomach is very messy since the surgery. Is that why you were with Burroughs? - Yes. That and nights I do not have particularly good. What do you mean? - I have nightmares every night. That certainly has something to do with the accident. Do you have nightmares? Yes, but I always feel I'm awake. It looks so real. So? No, ignore him. I'm sorry, I'm tired. I do not know what I'm talking about. But thanks for asking. No need to feel sorry for me. I do not have it. I just like you. - Seriously? Yes. Can I say something openly? God! It's okay! - It's not important. I'm sorry. Shit. Shit. - All good? I bit my tongue. I'll be right back. Yes. Rose? - Sorry. I have to go. That? You're good? - It 's my stomach. I have to go really, sorry. - Okay, I'll walk.

As a result, the brain sends signals false, which makes infuriate the victim. This is behavior aggressive and unpredictable. The victim becomes a danger to herself and others. What can we do? Poor Dana! - No, she's not Dana. Vaccinate in the early stages and isolate those with symptoms. Oh my God. We incubation times of less than 48 hours. How is this possible? - I have no idea. But a mutant strain with a short period of incubation, You can trigger an unprecedented epidemic. What about those who already have symptoms? We relieve his discomfort until finished. But we have to separate them , so that mass hysteria is not active. The small waiting a painful therapy. But no less rage. It spreads like a venereal disease. But if so many people contract the virus, then there must be some common denominator. A connection between these patients. A person infected? - I do not think he's human. But something has come into contact with many people, and if we do not stop, there will be many more victims. Are We issued a health warning ?. - No no no If you put this in the news, there will be panic. We need a quarantine for all infected and stop it . Rabies virus is one of the most dangerous in history. If we do not control this mutant strain, all mankind could be infected. Why we have to make an autopsy Dominic Danvers before it is too late. We need to ... For the love of God! Hear! No weapons! The man was sick! I was here to help! Miss! Miss? Does not it feel good? Slow slow. You should not walk around here alone so late at night.

Have you passed out and hallucinations are becoming stronger? I'm losing my mind. - It could not be faster. No, Chelsea should ... - Okay. He did the right thing, Mr. Hart. Rose, I 'm sorry you're suffering so much stress out of the clinic. I did not want to rush things. - The situation is out of control! Believe me, I know exactly what I'm doing. Dr. Burroughs, I'm sick. The virus which is spoken, comes from me! Quiet, Rose. - Terrible things happen. This is not a dream. This is my fault. Tranquila, Rose. I hurt people, and Chelsea is dead. How do you look at me? - Calm down, Rose. Take it easy. Do you take your supplement? No. - Come It's like blood, so do not drink. Is it blood? Why does my blood? Sounds crazy, but these are not hallucinations. Something happens to me. - Blood? Hallucinations are strong. You should tell the truth, doctor. All those people are dead or sick because of me. Rose, Rose, Rose. What if I tell you that there is a disease? And that 100,000 people will die today. 100,000 die every day people if they do not heal. No matter how healthy they are. Could you... Kill adults in their best moment, as well as newborn babies or seniors. She is ruthless and arbitrary. Rose, if you stop the disease, you could save the people, would you? Of course. Well, this disease is already here, Rose. She is already with us. And it is called death. We have a cure for it, but we can not do anything. It's right in here. What the hell is that? We have to get out of here. I should tell Rose, do you, Mr. Hart? You'd better tell the truth. - I can explain everything! I committed to Mr. Hart as your tutor. That? It was the perfect candidate. He easily approached you, and when I told him you were, Well, he is a journalist, You can not resist a story. That I am? Rose, this ... - Did you know all the time? No. I cared for you. - spying on me? How a scientific experiment? - No, is not that. How is it then? - I just wanted to protect you . He wanted it so! - But I ... I wanted that? Nobody asked me. - I know. I blew it. If you're right. That's right. Rose. ¡Oye! I love you - do not believe you. So much for integrity journalism, Mr. Hart. Burroughs, unclean bastard! What the hell is this? Is this blood? Your mind will be the biggest of your questions, when you relax and wait for the answer. What the hell does that mean? - Read a book. Your new body has a greater need for blood. You have to drink, Rose. I can not refuse. You should know long they are not hallucinations or dreams. You have a predator, Rose. And longs for liberation. - What did you do to me? I'm just exhausted allowing your potential untapped. To improve humanity. What about my humanity? An outdated concept and overrated! The human is limited. Now you're much more, Rose. Yeah, I know, the price is high. But all pay for life until death. The body kills cells to sustain life. Humans ate 56 billion farm animals last year. What you do to achieve immortality is nothing. And it is worth sacrificing a few. Reasonable to ensure the survival of the species. You have no right to play God! What God? We are God. What the hell? Shit! What is this thing? When cancer my wife was no longer treatable, she donated her body to science. And now it represents the progress of my research. Is that ... that was your wife? The first intervention saved his body, but then the cancer itself himself became immortal. And the human shell is transformed into something unique. I do not expect you to see the beauty in it. I limited myself to myself, by the constraints of a system of values based on the human being. Our humanity, so important for you, imposes restrictions. Cynthia was the first of many I could save ... as soon as I freed myself from concepts narrow-minded as humanity. ¡Rose! Do not get hurt! ¡No! Honey, Rose! So that their sacrifice is not in vain, Let live in you! Cynthia! Get away from my wife, dammit! No! Although it is reported the ... disproportionate use of military force, the rabies outbreak could be stopped, though. Because the vaccines were ineffective, all patients affected by the virus were euthanized. The health authority has lifted the emergency, because the epidemic could be contained as quickly as exploded. Health officials still are baffled about the cause. Initially there was talk of a rabies outbreak, government agencies now say ... it was an aggressive flu virus . Result of hysteria online. This way, you can now trust your neighbor again. However, many are missing. M @ X Subtitling Kavish Gayanath M @ X Please save the translation rights. No, this is not for you. You had your food. No no no. This is not for you, is for our guest. Good Morning. No. Yes, the immaterial immortality has a very high price, right? Okay, where were we?
