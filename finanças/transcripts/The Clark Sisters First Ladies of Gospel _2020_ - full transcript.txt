Yeah, Jacky, you're the oldest... Cullum and maybe in the Cullum household you rule the roost, but I'm the first born Clark, which means I'm in charge. Denise. What? Karen! Good night ladies. Good night, be careful girl. Twinkie, you take this. These are so beautiful. Why Mama keep her gold records hidden? So that daddy don't find 'em, Twinkie. Hush. I want gold records of my own one day. Daddy don't want us recording no albums so that ain't gonna happen. You're leaving again? I got a workshop, Clark. I told you that yesterday. Jacky got it all under control. You got Twinkie running up behind you everywhere you go. She missing school. She can't cook. She can't clean. I want my girls to do more than cook and clean. And what is that? Lord have mercy. You want them to be the Jackson 5? Guess you're going to be Joe Jackson. No I don't want them to be Jackson 5. They better than the Jackson 5. He who exalts himself will be humble. It don't look good on you, Maddie. What, Clark? Ambition. Let's start from the top. Y'all ready? Twink, you ready? All right, let me hear y'all. Lord we pray for travel and mercies.

I was worried about you. You look so cute in your uniform. Why are you here, Mama? I filed for divorce from Clark, it's official. I've got to get back to work. I see you spendin' a lot of time with that Glen fellow. He's really good to me, Mama. That's good. You deserve to be happy. So do you. It's my house now. And I want you home. What about now, Mama? No. Who was it this time? Twinkie. Come on, do it again. One, two, three- and Karen, you're too high. Karen. She says it you. Come on, do it again. One, two, three, and in. Cut, cut, cut.

You don't need to be able to tell whether it's Twinkie or Karen, Jacky, Denise or Dorinda. One voice. I'm about to go, when I come back, you got to have it right. Get it right. Yes ma'am. Is y'all asleep?! - Do you have it? - Yes. Yes ma'am. Let me hear it. This gonna be for the first album? Yep, we waitin' on their song. Bring the drums down in the mix and bring up Twinkie about 2-DB. Got it, ma'am. Oh, Lord. Stop it, stop it. Stop it, Bill, stop it! Dorinda, who is you singing to? Cats? The song is about suffering, right? You're talking to people suffering, you're trying to help somebody, right? I thought I was, Mama. You thought wrong. You want me to do something different, Mama? Baby, you just sing what Twinkie sing. All right girls, y'all, blow it out. And Dorinda? Let me hear that! Yes, ma'am. Go ahead, Bill, right away. Mattie Moss Clark... ..I must admit, you're a genius. You have to admit it? Did you doubt it? Turn 'em back on. That felt good! What felt good, baby? Bein' in the studio, getting behind a mic, singin' the same thing a thousand times? I've loved every bit of it. Well, you get used to it and you gonna start singing solo. Huh, Mama? You heard. So-lo. - Bye, Uncle Bill. - Bye, Dorinda. - Give me my purse. - Here, Mama. Really, Mama? Yes. Solo. Mama, do you think they'll play our song on the radio? I don't see why not. Won't Bishop get mad? Church of God in Christ believes in spreading the gospel. That's what we doing, right? Yeah, but Bishop say you ain't saved if they play your song on the radio. We know we saved and sanctified. That's all that matters. Go ahead. - Bye, Uncle Bill. - Bye, Twinkie. All right Bill, we gon' see you later. Have a good one. My girls blew it out, though, didn't they? - Yes, they did! - They blew it out! Fix your hat, baby, fix your hat. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Okay. Mama, can I just get a break sometimes? I'm always travelling with you. We gotta get these songs right. How long it's gon' take you to study for the test? At least a week. A week? What, you... you don't want me to keep going to school? I'm saying you might... I'm just saying, you might have to make a choice. Mama. This is my dream! I thought your dream was to serve God. So this is it. How are you feeling? Happy. Nervous. Everything at once. You going to make an excellent wife. I'm gonna miss you. Mama, I'm just getting married. You act like I'm moving to Siberia! I feel like it. You know you're my rock. And I'm always gonna be. Clark was rough on you and Leo. He was rough on all of us, Mama. You know... - Take this. - Mama, where did... - That $50 you've been giving me, every two weeks, out your paycheck. I never spent a dime. You take that money. And you do for your household. I can do for mine. You understand me? Yes, Mama. Y'all some pretty girls. Ohh, my goodness. Come on, let's do this. Let's don't keep that old Glenn waiting. All right, y'all, UNAC only comes once a year. There's a big ol' crowd out there, y'all gotta kill it! Now Karen? Karen! - Yeah? I want you to sing lead on that first song. But, Mama, there's so many people out, there, that's... - If you don't stop being shy, and use the gift that God gave you! Now look, by the time this convention is over I want folks to be beggin' for the Clark Sisters. The gospel is gonna go forth one way or another but I need y'all to sell records tonight. Alright, Dodo, give us a prayer. Okay. Father God, we come to you just to say thank you for this opportunity. Lord, as we decrease, may you increase and use us for your glory. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen! Alright y'all, blow it out! Y'all so pretty! Y'all some pretty girls! - Alright Mama. - Come on child, come on! You need to break outta that. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Hallelujah! That's a lot of people, Mama. Church is a whole lotta people and it's just rehearsal. And this is rehearsal for something even bigger. You can do it. You ready. Music Department President, Doctor Mattie Moss Clark, and put your hands together to praise the Lord! Praise the Lord's saints. Praise the Lord's saints! Praise the Lord's saints. Praise the Lord's saints! Amen, amen, amen. First give an honor to God, who is the head of my life. I came all the way from Detroit, Michigan to let you know that I am saved and sanctified and I am feeling the Holy Ghost. But I came here to have church this morning. I woke up this morning having church. Yes. Praise in God for all, all he has done for me. I want to bring up my girls, I want to bring up my daughters. Come on out here, Twinkie. Y'all give her a hand clap. Y'all just waiting to give her a hand clap, that's alright. That's alright. Now y'all know Twinkie, Twinkie been playing for me ever since she was nine years old. Girl plays so good if she wasn't my daughter, I wouldn't believe. Touch your neighbor and say, "She got that right." She got that right! Amen, now these are her sisters, this is Jacky, this is Dorinda, this is Denise, and this is my baby girl right here, this is Karen. These are the Clark Sisters, amen? Amen. Now these girls could be out there singing for the devil. But they have given their voices, their gifts, to God, somebody oughta say amen. Amen! Somebody oughta shout right now! Anybody in the need of a blessing this evening? Amen. Amen! I can do all things, all things through Christ. That strengthens me. Sing high, baby. Sing! Come on baby, you can do it. What I tell you?

Our album is number 20 on the charts! - Oh, my God! - Are you serious?! - We finally got some... - Hey, uh, you need some help over there? No, but we gonna be famous. Yeah, you and me both. Sir, we're the Clark Sisters and our song just got on the gospel charts, right here! No kidding! What y'all working on next? Well... Sing it. Sing Karen! Where's the rest? That's all there is. - You know this is not what we agreed to. - What can I say? We didn't sell as many ticket as we... You've got a full house out there! It's not what it looks like. God gonna get somebody, because somebody lyin'. - This is the business... - No, no, you look. Do you hear them people out there? My girls came up in there and blew this thing out better than anybody they got on that stage. And one day, ONE day, you will come begging to let the Clark sisters get on your stage and it's going to be a sad day. - Oh, I doubt that. Because I ain't gonna let it happen. Ain't gonna happen. Twink! Twinkie! Twinkie! Girl, get up. Hey. It's two in the morning. Where you been, Neicy? Out. Ugh. Another one of your all night benders? Yeah. You still got a little lipstick on you, better get that off just in case Mama come down. I don't care. - Neicy. - I'm tired of caring. I'm tired of all her rules. I... I feel like she's choking me. - Choking you? - Yes. Forget about all that. So do you have a boyfriend? I got more than one. More! You got more than one boyfriend, too! - No, I don't! - Yes, you do. There's Oregon, that notebook, these... What you think? I'mma be happy here with y'all? Hmm? Getting old and dusty with Mama? - Neicy. - Girl please, I gotta live. I got to go out, I got to have me some fun. - Some fun? - Mmm-hmm. Are you having sex? What do you think? - Girl... - Mmm-hmm. Twinkie, you deserve to live a good life. What're gonna do? You gonna play for Mama forever? Gonna be 80 years old with no teeth? Talkin' 'bout, "What you want me to play for you, Mama?" No, no, no, I'm not. You gotta think about what you're giving up. You gave up Howard University because it was too much for you to play and study at the same time. You can't live like that. Neicy... Look, your life IS Mama's life. - No, it's not! - Yes, it is. It is. And that just ain't gon' be me, and I don't want that for you, but that's not gon' be me. I gotta set it up, I gotta have a good time! Who's comin' in like a thief in the night? You know, Mama... the only time you do let us out is to sing something. And for what? So we can make the great Doctor Mattie Moss Clark look good? Why would you hit me?! Have you lost your mind, why would you put your hands on me?! Mama, why would you hit ME? Is coming up in here in the middle of the night? Denise! You wanna live what you sing about? You wanna live that life?! She not gonna stay in this house, actin' like that to me! Are you crazy?! It's gonna be okay Ma, it's okay. Both of us can't stay in this house like this. I know she talk to you, you better talk to her. 'Cause both of us ain't gon' live staying in this house like this... let me go! - You want some juice? - Yes. I'll take some too, Mama. Thank you, Mama. Mama, can I say grace this morning? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Dear Lord, we thank you for this food that has been prepared for the nourishment of our bodies. Lord, I ask you to give me the strength not to jump up and grab my sister by her nappy head. These and other blessings, we ask in your darling son Jesus' name. Amen. Mama, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay, Neicy. I'm sorry. Come on y'all, let's go. Denise... ..you can sing or run from Detroit to DC, but that's not your anointing. Your anointing is the life you live. What you do when you're not on stage, what you do when people ain't clapping, what you do when ain't nobody looking but God. You can't be up there singing songs about sanctification and consecration, you be having more spirit than anybody. Now, you living a raggedy life? No. I can't let you do that. Mama, you gotta understand... Are you hungry? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Hey Mama. You happy now? Mama, they want us to wear pants at work. I don't care what them "Don't know God folks" do at your job. This is a sanctified house. You don't wear pants up in here, you know better. Mama! What are you doing?! Wearing pants, you probably smokin' reefer too. For real Mama? Come on in here. We need to look at the schedule, I think we done double booked. Come on. You got Memphis on here twice. Open. Oh my God, Craig! Are you serious? I'm very serious. Will you take my hand in marriage? I will. I will. Oh my... I love you. Twinkie, Twinkie I'm engaged! Congratulations Dorinda. I'm going to get married! I'm not satisfied with your voices. Because you, you... I don't feel what you're singing. Dorinda, you lookin' one way, Jacky and Karen, y'all lookin' another way. If you lookin' anywhere except at my hand, you lookin' the wrong way. Come on Twinkie, come on, start from the top. Now you know you playin' too slow. Mama, we've been here for five hours. Am I holding you up? You got somewhere to go? Matter of fact... Mama, Mama! Twinkie, we waitin' on you, it's hot in this car. Oh. Oh, you poutin'. Twinkie, I want you to take over the group. What, Mama? You write all the songs, you teach all the songs anyways, and you do better with your sister Neicy than I ever could. I'll handle the business but I want you to take over the group. Mama, do you even trust me? With my life. You and your sisters are my life. If you never sang another song... ..if you never wrote another song... ..you would still be my heartbeat. That's alright! Amen! Come on, Jerry, just put it over there. Alright. Look, you got to get them tenors to do better. - Me? - Yes, you. Oh, it's gonna take a prayer and a miracle to help them boys. I can sing, but I can't sing sing. Yes, you can! Not like your sister. I heard Karen hit a note one night, like to knock me through the window. Not through the window! Oh, boy. Well look, Karen can sing a run in every range, can't you, Karen? What y'all talking about? I was just telling Drew you can sing a run in every range. Mmm-hmm. She can, watch this. - I wanna hear. You about to. Say... - Oouf! - Really? - Yes, Karen. - You go. Go ahead, do it, do it. - Oouf, okay! - Now, y'all do this one again. Wait, what? Do this one together. All right, all right. Okay. I hear it, I hear it! I got potential. I heard a bottom in that. I hear it, I hear it. You got it. - Okay, it's got potential. Uh-huh, uh-huh. I think we actually kinda sound good together. Maybe we should get together. - Yeah, right. - That's funny? That's funny to you? - It is. - It is. I see you at church, all the girls run after you and you usually only let the prettiest ones catch up. So what you want with me? Mmm... Well, like you said, I only let the prettiest ones catch me. Karen Clark, you caught my eye. Miss Clark, can I speak with you for a moment? Oh, hey, Reza, what's going on? At the office, everyone's always together, and I wanted to have a word alone with you. Is this about our record deal? If it is, you should talk to my Mama. The Clark Sisters music is magnificent. But you are superb. Thank you. You're the heart and soul of this group. Your voice stands above and beyond everyone else's. The Clark Sisters sound is a blend of all of us. You know that. Yes, but you have a distinct sound of your own. I'd like you to consider going solo. Solo? Maybe even a secular record, R&B would just eat you up. Just think about it. Number's right there on the card. Maybe for now this stays between the two of us. Yeah, sure, I'll think about it. Twinkie! Hey, Reza! So nice to see you. I was hopin' to talk to you. Okay. Explain this again, because I'm not understandin', Twinkie. Twinkie, you really took a solo record deal in exchange for a Lincoln? I didn't take a solo record deal. I sold my catalog. Your catalog, what is that? Her catalog is all the songs she ever wrote. Twinkie, I can't believe you did this. You gave away the rights to your song to a record company? Mama, I didn't give them away. I sold them. Wait a minute. You sell 'em to who? Reza. Reza?! I know you know better than that. He asked me to go solo and I told him no, Twinkie. You told him no because you didn't want to break us up, or because you were too scared to do something on your own? Both! When he asked me I told him to talk to Mama. So you sold your catalog for this Lincoln parked out front? I deserve a nice car. Mama... - Give me the contract. You see that? That's why I got a nursing job. So no matter what kind of foolishness happened with y'all, I can get up in the morning, go to work and still get a check. Messing around with Twinkie, because even with hit records we'll continue to be broke. We gon' be on the road forever. They are my songs, y'all, I wrote 'em. That's why I told you to let me handle the business. Twinkie, you didn't just sell your songs. You sold your future. You sold your sisters' future. You've sold your children's future. You gon' look back at this day 20 years from now, you gon' feel real bad about yourself. Sorry, Mama. Sorry ain't gonna buy one shoe! It ain't gonna put one meal on this table! I look at you... ..and I see a woman, I see a woman. You got the face of a woman. You got the body of a woman. But you're still a child. You're a baby. - Mama... - Don't follow me. Twinkie, it's all right. It's all right. You just wanted something for yourself and that's all right. We'll get through this. But y'all, I mean, I like this print but ain't y'all tired of wearing these big old muumuus? Can't we be sanctified and stylish? Yeah. We gon' need to wear some big dresses for the next seven months. What's that supposed to mean? I'm pregnant. Pregnant? Does Mama know this? Neicy, how could you do this? We just got our number one record, just started doing national gigs. What are the people gonna say? They gon' say the Clark sisters are a bunch of hypocrites. That's what they gonna say. Don't! Calm down. Y'all, we are going to get through this. How do you know, Twinkie? You know how the Saints are. They may not buy our albums after this. COGIC people, especially. The bishops are the ones we should be worried about, they're gonna strip Mama's title 'cause of this. Neicy, you're so selfish. We can't go on stage like this, y'all. We got to cancel this performance. I agree, I agree. We need to figure out what to say... What y'all doin'? They gonna be callin' for y'all in a minute. I'm pregnant, Mama. That ain't no need, that ain't no need for you not to get dressed. Where's the... Where the dress at? Where the dress at? - Right there, Mama. Put it on. Put it on. And I'll have to sit in the car. Now, come on. Mama... They want to make me a pastor. How do you feel about that? Daddy was a pastor. Mhmm. You don't talk about your daddy too much, do you? I don't. But I think you'll be a great pastor. Yeah? Yeah. You could be my first lady. I don't know about all that. I don't want to be married to a pastor. Mama and Daddy didn't make it, and daddy was a pastor. Yeah, but I ain't your daddy, and you're not your mother. So you think I can do it? Be a pastor's wife? Of course. Yeah, we'll have 18 kids and that'll be our choir right there. - Not 18 kids... - 18 kids, I'm serious. Serious about what? Serious about making you my wife. Will you marry me? Are you proposing to me? - What it look like? - Are you really proposing? Yeah, I'm proposing. Get up, Joe, yes! - Will you marry me? - Yes, I will. - Yes, you'll marry me? - I will. Just promise me you'll be a good husband. Best. I need the scripture, what's the scripture? God give sunshine to the righteous. Hey y'all, come here, come down here right quick, right quick! I got a song, I got a song. What is it? Where's Neicy? Come on. I've got a new song, but it's the secret. That means you can't tell your mom, Jacky. Y'all act like I'd tell Mama everything. You do! Kiss my foot. Now what's the secret? I never heard that before. Ooh! That sounded like Stevie. Mama gonna kill you. I'm with you, Twink. Now how y'all know that's Stevie Wonder? I ain't deaf. I hear it in the street all the time, how can you not hear it? We can sing that? Yes we can, because we gonna be singing it to the Lord. That's right. Yeah. So y'all, repeat after me. Say this. Y'all got it, y'all got it. Say, "You came my way." Yes. Now say, "You heard me every time I pray." Now say, "you gave me grace." Yeah, but I need something to go right here. I know, y'all repeat after me. Yeah! Mama, what do you think? I don't know about that. Y'all trying to have this ready for the concert? Yes ma'am. That ain't all it is, is it? No, Mama, there is there more to it. I got some more. So we can sing it? I guess so. Just got to be ready. Got to be perfect. It'll be ready. And perfect. So wait, Mama wait, you sure we can sing it? Yeah, you can sing it. She don't even know! Right, you know, thatta girl. New York, and I've got a blazing hot record for you to check out. It's soaring to the top of the Gospel charts but it sounds more like Master Blaster than Mahalia Jackson. Y'all can say you heard it here. Turn that up, turn that up! Hey Mama, do this. Oh, try this one. Jacky! Jacky, come on, you're late! Late, late, late. I had to work. Hey Larry, sweetie. Don't be like your auntie! Listen to me now. Now let's look at the schedule. Okay, we got DC on a night, and then we have Detroit, back to Detroit and then Chicago the next week. What's the date on that? That's the 22nd. Oh, we gon' have to reschedule that cause we got the Grammys that week, and then we gon' have Memphis. - What did you say? - Mama, what did you just say? I said we got the Grammys that week and then we go to Memphis after that. What is wrong with you? YOU SAID THE GRAMMY'S. What is wrong with y'all? Mama, are you saying that we got nominated for a Grammy? I don't know, let me see what this says. Come on. You've been nominated for best soul gospel perform... Oh! And it says here they want y'all to perform. Now see? You see what hard work will do for you? Yes, ma'am. Are you happy, Mama? Hey Mama, I know you gon' perform with us, right? This y'all's moment, this is y'all's moment. No, we want you up there, and you've been talking about this since we were little girls. I'll think about it. I'll take that. Now I say here, y'all got two minutes, and y'all best to blow it out. That's all we need! Will the board accept my apology? It will take more than an apology. Our decision is final. You are dismissed. With all due respect, I want to say something. We're done, Dr Clark. I don't do what I do in this church because I want a position. I don't do what I do in this church because I want to be seen. You don't want to be seen. So how come we just saw you on national TV, dancing? That display, on a secular stage for the world to see, was a disgrace to the Church of God and Christ. It was a slap in our face. This is the Holiness Church. The Bible says go get in all the lands and spread the gospel, that's what we were doing. The Bible also says pride cometh before the fall. You're getting big, Mattie, you're getting too big. Do you want to make this right? Yes, I do. If you want to maintain your position as the International Music Department President, then you cannot perform with your daughters anymore. Our decision is final. You tryin' to keep me away from my girls? These are my children. This is my calling. God called me to do this just like he called Moses, just like he called Samuel, just like he called you, Bishop. He called me. This ain't about the church. This ain't about the Bible. This is about you trying to sit me down, trying to shut me up, trying to keep me in my place. Obedience is better than sacrifice, but you didn't learn that, Dr. Clark. Twink, what we gon' to lead with tonight? I was thinking about starting out with Naming and Claiming. Oh yeah! I like that one. Got that one voice, though, huh? Mama, are you really talking about one voice? You know we just sang on the Grammys, one voice? I don't care where you performed at. Okay. All right y'all, they ready for us. Okay. All right, come on, come on, come on. I'm standing next to you. We got to sing the same partner. Come on. Come on. Wait, Mama. Mama, you coming? Mama, we got to go. What's wrong? Y'all go on without me. What's this? Is this about... Don't ask me no questions. But Mama... Just go on. You gon' do good out there, just go on. Do great. Just go on, Dorinda, go on. Go fast here, I'm praying. Mama, do you think you can watch the boys for me tomorrow? I got a doctor's appointment. You gon' have to take them with you, I got somewhere to go tomorrow. They can't go with you? Denise, I have had my kids. You can't watch your grandkids? I raised my kids, you need to do the same. Come on, Miss Me, and wait for us. Does anybody need a pen? We all need pens. You can get one when you leave. Denise, you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm not signing this contract, but I'm fine. Would you give us a moment please? Certainly. Neicy, you have to sign this. I ain't gotta do nothing but stay black and die. What are you doing, Neicy? She's trying to sabotage this record deal like she does everything else. Sabotage, where'd you get that from? We're a gospel group. And you on baby number three out of wedlock. What do you call... - Jacky, my babies are my business. Okay? - We don't have time for this foolishness. This is the best deal I can negotiate. After that mess that Twinkie made, we need this. Mama, let her go. No! God's plan is for y'all sisters to stay together. No, Mama. Get it right. It's not God's plan. It's your plan. All we ever did was what you wanted us to do. Did you ever ask us what we wanted? Huh? No. Neicy, why don't you just sign the contract? I mean, these terms are pretty good. Says the master to the slaves, Twinkie, wake up! A new contract means more time underneath her thumb. I need to live my own life. I have to be my own woman. Tell me why you hate me so much. Mama... I do not hate you, Mama. I just don't have nothing left for you. What do you mean, you don't have nothing left? Karen! She gave everything she had to you, to Twinkie, to Jacky, and Dorinda, and the church, and I got the scraps! I got the scraps, Mama, the scraps. So that's why I don't have nothing left for you, because you didn't leave nothing for me. Neicy? What, though? What? You may be our sister... but you are so hard to love. Y'all ain't perfect. But y'all never been hard to love... because you're all my sisters. Hey. Let me help you with that. Thank you. I'm John. John Turrell. Well, it's nice to meet you, John Turrell. I'm Twinkie Clark. Oh, I know who you are. It's a pleasure to meet you. How'd you get that name anyway, 'cause I know your Mama didn't name you "Twinkie". No, my Mama named me Elbernita after my daddy, Albert. "Twinkie" came from my oldest sister, Jacky. - Okay, okay. - Yeah. They say I was a cute little baby, and Jacky thought she saw a twinkle in my eyes like a star. Mama said, "Let's call her 'Twinkie'," and I've been "Twinkie" ever since. Well, that's a beautiful story. Thank you. Although I was expecting to hear something about a yellow snack cake. So, do you have a boyfriend? Look, I'm always on the road with Mama and my sisters, and when I'm home I'm usually working on new music. Well, maybe it's time for that to change. Come on. Somebody say something. I don't know what to say, Twinkie. Neicy leaving was hard enough. Now you, too? I ain't got no words. I got words. We just runnin' all over Mama. Everything she built we just runnin' it in the dirt. We travelling all over the world, singing. Finally starting to make some money. Finally starting to make some real money. What else you want? And I'm just trying to understand why do you have to leave the group to be married? I'm married. Dorinda, Jacky. We all married, but we're not leaving, Twinkie! Because he wants me to go with him. Plenty of people stay in different places to be in a group! I don't want to be in the group anymore y'all, married or not. Everything I do is yours and ours. I want something that's mine, just mine. Jacky and Dorinda, y'all can sing and play. Not like you, Twinkie. Not like you. Karen, I know you're scared, but you can write. I told you, you can! Not like you, Twink. See, I'm y'all's crutch. I love y'all, but I'm leaving. Go. Be happy for me. Jacky... Be happy for me. Karen... sis... please, be happy for me. I'm happy for you, Twink. Mama... Can you just be happy for me? Please. Twinkie... you just shot a bullet through this family. Jacky, take me home. Hey, Mama. How you doing? I'm fine. What brings y'all back? Just wanted to say goodbye before we got on the road. Yes, ma'am. We got a long drive ahead of us. Long drive where? North Carolina. Twinkie, that's where you going? Mama... Is you working? No, but I'mma get a job as soon as I get down there. Oh. You gonna get a job. Mama... Poor decisions, Twink. Poor decisions. Two things you could do. Make good music and poor decisions. Did she tell you she sold all her songs for a car? - Baby, go outside! - Did she tell you that? Go outside, John! Mama! - Did she tell you that, huh?! How you gotta be like that, Mama?! Let me show you something. Show you what me and Jack did. Me and Jacky, we went through the schedule. We done went through the schedule. Now, look. We have right here next week, we have the 13th, the 15th and the 19th. We got rid of all them dates. Mama, it's not that. Y'all don't have to do nothing. Nothing! It's all clear. You can have all the time you want. Now, we made it so that even in... Mama. Mama, it's not that! What is it?! I gotta get away from you! Everything I do is for you, is to please you! You don't need to be pleasing me! You need to be pleasing God! I don't know the difference! Your calling has been my calling, and I got to find my own! You had nothing to say, nothing to say when Jacky got married! Nothing to say when Dor got married! And nothing to say when Karen got married! But me... why me?! Why me, Mama?! Because you need me. You need me. You need me. The first man pay attention to you, you want to marry him. You a child, Twinkie. You need me. - You need me. - You're right. - Yeah. - I do. - I need you. - You need me. - You do need me. - But you need me, too! I need my mother! You just need an organ player. Time to go, Twink. Come on. Don't do this. Mama, we gotta go. Come on, Twink. Come on, Twink. Mama, we gotta go. Don't do this. No! Ah! Mama! Mama! Come on, Twink, we gotta go, baby. Come on, baby. Don't take her from me! Twink! What's the matter? It ain't the same y'all. It just ain't the same. I know, Karen, but we gotta finish this. The label's asking for it Friday. I ain't worried about that, Dor. I miss my sisters. My main feeling, well, everything is off! Hi, Twinkie. I, uh... just want to hear your voice. I just want to know... I just want to know you're all right. Where you been all night? I thought you had a show. I did. Where have you been? And why's this place still a mess, Twinkie? John, I'm doing the best I can. I'm taking care of our son. I'm working on my album and I'm booking shows at night just to put food on the table. And when do you get the advance on the album? We need some money coming in now. I already got it. - You got it? - Yes. You got it? Why didn't I see it? 'Cause it was small. We had to pay bills, John, and... and remember, we had to get the car fixed. Well, you're a Clark sister. The famous one of the group. You need to start bringing in some real money. Oh, baby I just... I need time. Okay? You want me to make you some breakfast? I want you to make some money. There's no reason we should be living in an apartment driving a ten-year-old car! Should have left you with your Mama. Mama, what you eatin'? You know you can't eat that. Jacky... I prayed.. And God told me I was healed! - Mama... - I'm healed. You're not even taking your medicine. I'm healed! Sit down. I got something for you. Oh, my... What? These are pants! Oh, Mama! I wanted to get you something I know you'd like. Thank you, Mama. Talk to your sister. If I say yes, will you take this medicine? No. I'm not a soft woman, Jacky. I push... and I push... and I push and I push and I push and then I push some more. I wanted you to be great, and I wanted you to be great for God! I wanted you to do things that were pleasing in his sight! And I didn't know any other way how to do that! But, Mama, you did right by us, and I don't want you to ever think anything but that. Please, don't. Let Denise live her own life. And let Twinkie live her own life. Let 'em go. I'm their mother. I can't do that. They'll be back. But, Mama, I'm here, and I need you to be here for as long as possible, so, please... please... take these meds. Mama, what's going on with your foot? It ain't nothing. Jacky, now, come on. - Mama, I gotta get your coat. - Don't make no big deal out of it. We gotta get your foot checked. It ain't nothin'. It ain't nothin'! Ah, there's my girls. - Mama. - Mama. Oh, Mama. How are you feeling? Karen, Hand me my glasses. You okay? I'm good. I'm fine. Now, sit down. Sit down, Kar. Where's Twinkie? We called her. We left her a message. We'll call her again. Now, what y'all gonna sing at convocation? We ain't thinking 'bout no convocation. Why not?! Why not?! We gotta see about you first, Mama. Oh, I told Jacky these doctors don't know what they're talking about. They don't know what they're talking about. Why you in the hospital, then? You ain't been taking care of yourself, so now we're gonna take care of you, Mama. Oh, stop fussin'! Stop fussin'! If I wasn't sick, you're gonna make me sick! Mama... Now, I want you all to sing at convocation. They need somebody out there who can sing. Here's the doctor. Hey, doctor, these my girls I've been telling you about. There's three of them. I've got two of them on their way. These the Clark Sisters. Right. Mmm-hmm. You ain't heard of the Clark Sisters?! These girls got I don't know how many Grammy nominations and number one albums. Mama. Y'all sing. Y'all sing for her. Maybe we could sing a little bit of Praying Spirit. Okay. Come on, Karen. Sing. You weren't looking at my hand. I saw. You weren't looking at my hand. I'm sorry, Mama. See, this Dorinda right here. My knee baby. That's Mattie Moss Junior. My preacher. My fire. Now, this is Jacky. She's my rock. She's my melody. You hold us all together, don't you, Jacky? Yes, Mama. Now, this right here is my baby girl right here, Karen. She's the Michael Jackson of the family. You got that right! Don't let her sing nothing. Don't let her. She gonna put this whole hospital out of business...'cause you can't feel bad and listen to her. She don't know what she's capable of. I just gotta get her to believe it. Well, they take after their mother. Oh, no, they ain't nothing like me. They better than me. Excuse me. DoDo, what's the matter? Huh? Just need God to heal you, that's all. I just need Him to heal you. Oh, I told you these doctors don't know what they talkin' 'bout. God... God has the final say. Excuse me. Now, I want you to go get me some Better-Maids. Mama, you... Go get me some Better-Maids. We're gonna bring you some applesauce. No. Don't you come in here with no applesauce. Don't be bringing me no sour cream up in here. I want some barbecue. I know, barbecue, Mama, I know. I think I'm just gonna stay here, though. No, don't... Tell her. Tell her. Her vitals are good. We'll take good care of her. I'm fine. Come on. God has the final say. Say that. Say it. God has the final say. Go ahead with your sisters. They're my girls. My girls. - Did you know she was coming here? - No. Amen. Amen! - Amen. - I said Amen! Amen. I'm Denise Clark. I can't believe this. And these are my seven boys that Mama and the family don't want y'all to see, but that's all right because we here. Amen! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Ya'll know if Mama was here she wouldn't let y'all be on this floor this quiet! She would say, "Thank you, Jesus! "Thank you, Jesus!" Thank you, Jesus. My Mama, she taught me all that I know. And that's the reason I'm able to stand up here today. I thought that one of her daughters should have the strength... Get up there! Get on that mic. And that's why I'm here. Doctor Mattie Moss Clark was my Mama! She was my Mama, and she taught people how to sing! I can talk. I can stand up here and I can talk about my Mama. Praise the Lord, church. Doctor Clark has touched the lives of so many people and none more than her lovely family. -my Mama. You know, this is the day that the Lord has made. There's another car behind this one, so you can take that one. Why can't I ride in this one? I thought you might want to stay with your children. My children... can go with my husband. I want to ride in this one. Can you just ride in the second car? We'll talk about this later. Talk about what?! How y'all treating me like I'm some outsider. I have every right to be in this car. After that mess you just poured at my mother's funeral, you oughta be ashamed of yourself and you shouldn't want to be near any one of us. So, what is that? A threat? Try me and find out! Neicy. Neicy. Come on. I'll ride in the other car with you. It's okay. Come on. And for the record, this was my mother, too! She is MY mother! Y'all don't get a special badge for being her lackey! Have you lost your mind?! Come on. At Mama's funeral, Neicy?! Karen. Karen! - I will knock you out! - Fine! I'll get in the other car, 'cause y'all wanna treat me like I'm not family then I won't be! Mama is gone, and there is nothing else holding us together. Nothing. Goodbye, Clark Sisters. Neicy, come on. Y'all don't ever have to worry about me coming around y'all again! She's gone. They don't need me. I just can't wrap my head around it. If I could have somersaulted to that pulpit faster... I sure would have. I think she needs help. Maybe we all do. What? What you say, Do? Let's just get through these papers. Where's Twinkie? Mama, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry, Mama! Twinkie. Come on, get up. Mama! Where am I? You in the hospital, Twink. You had a nervous breakdown. With Mama... and you and John's divorce... You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be just fine. I've been praying, I've got intercessory prayer going. You'll be back on that organ in no time. I gotta go. Gotta go, Jacky. I love you. I'll follow you out. Did she ask about me? Who? Mama. Oh, it's all right, Twink. Mama understood. You were working. I left her, didn't I? It's okay, Twinkie. It's all right. I wasn't there. It's all right, Twinkie. It's all right. Dorinda. I gotta take Glenn's Mama to the doctor and then I gotta work a double shift, so can... can you come tomorrow and sit with Twinkie 'cause I'm tied up. Look, I gotta be taking care of everybody. Dorinda, stop! Look, I'm tired. I need you to step it up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jacky. Dorinda! I can't do this anymore! You said you wouldn't give me more than I could bear. I can't bear it. I need you to speak to me. I need you to speak to me. Won't you speak to me? Neither height nor depth can separate me from your love. Yes, Lord! Thank you, Jesus! Thank you for loving me. Thank you for saving me from myself. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus! I want you to understand something. You are absolutely perfect. You don't have to change anything about yourself. You understand? I understand. I'll be fine. This is for me. I'm the youngest of the family usually doing what everybody else wants. This is for me. I will be fine, I promise. Stop worrying. Alright, baby. Jacky, what's going on? They ran into complications. What kind of complications? She's in a coma. Coma? They sayin' she got a 2% chance of making it. You saying we might lose her? She's gonna make a full recovery. Oh! Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Hey. Hey, welcome back. You never leave my side, do you? No. I never will. I told you I'll be fine. Hey, Twink. I'm in here. Hey. Hey, how are you? I'm good, sis. How are you? How you doing, Twink, you all right? You sure you feelin' all right? I'm doing all right. I'm good. Drew and I came by 'cause I wrote this song. I couldn't write a song like you, but I wrote this song and I want my sisters to sing it. Karen, this is really good. - You really think so? - Yeah. This is really good. Twinkie, come sing it with us, please. It's been way too long. Karen, y'all don't need me. Yes we do, Twink. I messed up the group. You didn't. Y'all just go on without me. We miss you, Twinkie. You've got a calling on your life. Don't let your past or anyone hold you hostage. You got to move forward. And we got Donald Lawrence producing in it. Now I know you like Donald Lawrence! Come on, Twink. You know he knows our sound. That's right. Come on. The people need you. I need you, your sisters, Dorinda, Jacky. - What about Neicy? We tried, Twinkie. We tried. Just think about it, Twink. You brought everyone together. Your sisters need you. All right ladies, it's showtime. Packed house, standing room only. All right, I'm ready brother. All right, Jacky? Well, you know I'm ready. Yes you are. Karen baby, didn't we talk about this? - We did. - You ready? - I'm ready. - Okay. Where's Twinkie? Help me, Mama. Help me. Help me. When you play, when you touch that organ, that's God in your hands. When you sing that's God in your throat, and when you write, that's God in your pen. That's anointing, and I'm speaking into you now, Twinkie, because I'm your mother. If you never sang another song, if you never wrote another song, you would still be my heartbeat. Daughter, we waitin' on you. All right ladies, we got to go. Did you find Twinkie? No, I didn't find Twinkie, but it's all right, the show goes on. Y'all got this. You got this. They're expecting to see all four of us. Twink! Y'all, they waiting on us. Twinkie, why you do us like that? Together for the first time in years. The legendary Clark Sisters. Oh, yeah!
