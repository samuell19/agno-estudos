"THE ALMOND TREE MYSTERY" CLOSED FROM 2:00-4:00 - What are you doing? - Sending a message to Alfonso. Let me send it, OK? Someone could come, Lucia. Someone could come, besides I'm tired. Don't answer! Hello. Buddy I have good news. Guess? I don't know. What? Don't be an ass, and think. I have no idea, tell me the news. - What are you doing, buddy? - Why?. You sound agitated. Is just that I'm... I'm exercising. Fine, I would bet you were fucking. No man, I'm not. You're jerking off? Aren't you bro? No... I'm exercising. - Don Joaquin called me. - Who? Don Joaquin, he wants to give us a case. I hope so... - ... I really need the money. - Yes, me too. There's something weird with you. No... I tell you I'm exercising. I'm doing sit ups. Right. OK, I believe you then. Look, we have an appointment with him at 5 o'clock, at the Americas tower, I'll see you there 10 min. before 5, OK? You're making me sick with so much fucking panting. - See you there. - OK. I should have known, next time I'll tell my friends to call us. You were incredible! Come in. - The guys are here. - Let them in. After they've left, call to Barcelona. Yes sir. Please come in. Sit here. - Hi! - Good evening, Don Joaquin. Thank you. Do any of you use high heels? There's no point for you to be here. They told us you needed two young collaborators, with experience. And with certain physical characteristics. So here we are, to learn with you. It's all part of the job. Stand up... walk like if you were wearing high heels. Here? Where else. I need to see how you perform. You want the job, or not? Move you're so stiff. It's necessary to do this? Or you're joking us? Sit down. - Names? - Javier Moreno and... - Alfonso Castillo. - Ages? Both 27, co-workers of profession. Where were you born? - I was born here. - I'm from Monterrey. Are you homosexuals? Of course... yes. - What the fuck is this? - Big mistake... nothing should frighten you. Please apologize my friend. I was clear about the type of guys I needed. Artist, yes you look Like... gentleman, you're not so bad... Audacious; why not is part of the profession,... But specially that they were "Open Mind". I don't want... them scared so easily and preference, "Homosexuals". We can do everything, but not the fag thing. We fail you. If you want to keep learning, you can't give up so easily. What did you mean with... ...with "open mind"? "Open mind"... Young people use Open Mind, liberal people, gays. The definition is Open Mentality free of prejudices and... moral conventionality. The case for which I need your help and hope you don't defraud me is in fact a very open mind lady. A very cool lady, as we would say. The lady lives in a country house, widow... ...of common appearance.... ...she has the habit to invite to her big house... a very, very special people. Do you understand it? So she invites who ever fag she meets. Homosexuals. Leaders and sympathetic of sexual diversity. Hippies, extravagant artists. Perverse intellectuals etc. Do you understand now? Our widow likes to be surrounded by strange people. She doesn't invite women spending their time at the TV... Husbands worried to sell insurance; never! She only invites this very special people. And why do you need us? I'm close to getting married, - and I really don't understand. - It sounds very interesting. You have very sly case. Some of her guests have disappeared after being there. What a coincidence, don't you think so? Our heroine has done something good for our country. So you think she makes them disappear? - It's not enough. - You need evidences. She has invited a couple of gays. - She only knows their names. - And you want us to be them? If you agree, of course! The private investigation until we find any evidence is paid... ...by a Catalan of ancestry. She lost her daughter. Her only daughter, in tragic circumstances. Carmen... ...a painter of promising future... ...was murder, mutilated... ...and thrown to a sewer. Raquel... ...her girlfriend, Mexican, a university actress... And main suspect, as well as Lady Open Mind. They were interrogated and found not guilty... Raquel is missing... and it could happen the same. What luck? Carmen's mother has entrusted me, to find and recover... an oil painting, that her daughter painted. And it could be in the possession of... the fugitive actress or at the Lady Open Mind's house. Our job involves only to recover the oil painting. The authorities are investigating the crime. Incompetents. Your advance payment. If you find any additional clues, you will get a juicy recompense as an extra pay. We will begin by changing your names... ...you could be... ...Alejandro... ...And you GiIberto. With care, today you will know the real Alejandro and GiIberto. What are you drinking? Would you invite me? Hi! Would you give me light? - I don't smoke. - No?... What a pity. Be very careful, this Open Mind lady, as she calls herself... could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. I don't want you to be part of the missing people. Call me on my cell at the slightest hint of danger. Do√±a Josefina! I'm delighted to meet you. - Welcome. - Thank you. Alejandro, at your service, and he's GiIberto. Just how I imagine you. No more no less. Really?. Weekends are the domestic services' days off, you will... - have to carry your baggages. - Don't worry; we're used to it. To carry weight, not luggage. Is part of the trip. By the way it's possible... that we could only stay for two days. We have an invitation to Puerto Vallarta. We Like to travel! Yes I know... Are you a couple, or just friends? The relationships are so complicated... you may end being good friends. Excuse me. I understand it's not easy to admit those things. Don't apologize. Beside it's the truth. Then I will put you, in the same room. Congratulations you're a very handsome couple. Thank you for the invitation. It's a pleasure. Talented boys is what we need. - Your house is very cool! - You live her alone? Yes, you don't count with the domestic service. We don't get along. - Are we the first one's? - And the only one's. The other guests canceled, last hour impediments. It's a pity you'll not know them. - It's great to have guests. - I love people... ...I don't feel lonely with people Like you... ...besides, I learn a lot. Make yourself at home. I hope you enjoy them. - Don't you Like it? - Of course we do. Is just that he's very shy. Don't be, I Like that my guests enjoy their stay without inhibitions. If you want to cool down, I have a pool. Swimming suits are not necessary. Thank you for accepting my invitation. Although you'll only stay for two days... it'll be enough for me, Excuse me. And?... It sucks! The Lady could be my mother. That pretty?. Come on man. I didn't know you liked old ladies. You should have told me before... ...although you don't look Like stepfather. - It's very hot here bro. - It's spring buddy. Clothes off. - What's that? - What? Don't fuck with me man, we came to work! Leave it, I promised Lucia! You have a nice ass. I'm better from this side, ass-hole. And do me a favor; I don't Like that kind of jokes. OK? - Just remember why we're here - To work... so you have to act Like my lover OK? - Is that all madam? - Yes. And put on your uniform. You'd have canceled the invitation... ...you're risking too much. And raise suspicions for changing my habits? She really looks Like a mother. You doubt she's the one who's killing them? I don't fucking care. If I find out that she's the criminal. No matter how much she looks Like my Saint mother,.. I'll fuck her. You can't do that, remember we're not the law. Luckily our job doesn't depend on law, and why not say so... I always have felt Like doing justice by my own hand. Are you serious man? Of course not. I'm joking, first it was you, and now I. - It's very hot. Isn't? - I'm use to it. - The cicadas are very noisy. - Yes. - Are you getting into the pool? - No, not for now. Would you Like a glass of water, or a beer? - A beer for me. - Water please. I'll take a dip. - What are you reading? - Sorry?. "Domestic service voluntary speech", in Spanish. By Jose de la CoIina. It's a great book. My husband read this book in French. He said that the world... could change, if their proposal were put in practice. - Interesting. - Let me... I want to read you... "The town is the one that enslaves and slaughters itself. The one that could choose between being subjected or free. Rejects the freedom and accepts victory. In there martyr the one that conscious or rather it looks for it. " Do you receive visits every weekend? Almost every weekend. And by curiosity, how do you select us? By the people that come, they always recommend another... and so forth. It's Like a chain. Your world is so small. Yes, I suppose. Come, don't be an ass! The water is delicious. My lover has a hell of a mouth, forgive him. I love that. - Do you say bad words? - It doesn't go with me. If it depend on that, then most of us were polite. Thank God only a few are Like me. How boring if nobody said bad word. Yes. Thank you. I'll be right back. You need something? No, it's just that I have stuck in my teeth a piece of meat. How many years as a couple? Like seven. But we know each other since we were 15. Since then? Marvelous! Please, don't tell you saw me. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. Why do you spy on us? - Please don't accuse me. - Why should I? Are you deaf? I warn my guests not to leave the house, because people... from around here are very perverse and nosy. You think so? They're very bourgeois, nosy. The mediocrity suffocates them. That's why they keep an eye in the neighbors... .. to discover any immorality, Like vultures. That's why I prefer to Live between my four walls. I have everything I need, and for my guests too. Even pornographic videos. I have one of my favorites,.. gays of course very handsome. The lady knows how to have fun. - Take it. - What? Take a picture here. We come to work! With those sock's? - they're for the flies. - They're cool. - Everything is ready. - Thank you. - You need something else. - No, everything is fine... - You may go. - Yes. - And hide from them. - I'll be in my room. No way man, the room stinks Like smoke. You're still looking at that? Let me see. I never though things work Like that. It's repulsive! I thought that faggots were effeminate, impotent. Dinner is ready. Whenever you want. She doesn't get scared by anything. What if she had found you, with your full salute? Look, it's only pornography?. - But for pussies. - Yeah. That's why you cover yourself? How do you think her guests disappeared? I don't know. But that she cuddles them, she does. Of course. And where was your last exhibition? Excuse me. Your last exhibition. - At a friend's house. - In his house? But you should see the house, it's Like a gallery. It's very pretty. Did you bring any of your work? I would Like to buy one or two. I told him, but he never listens. What a shame! I will keep only the references. - And good references? - Magnificent! Especially the thematic you handle. "The Incest". - Incredible, isn't it? - Everything was delicious. It was fucking great. He meant that, it was very good. The night is young; we'll take the coffee and digestive... ...at the lounge that's near your room. I'll be right with you. If you continue Like that, you'll fuck up everything. Look jerk, wait till she asks you for your poetry writings. I won't be stupid Like you. You fucking poet prick! Lousy detective! Go and watch over. Don't be ashamed. You should take it naturally your breast's lost. The embarrassment does you harm. Besides it wasn't your fault. It was a question of health. Promise me you'll make an effort to over come it. Hey take a picture of this! You know how much Carmen loved you. And how she supported you. So do it for her memory. I'll return it in a second. You know who he is? I think it's her late husband. Are you sure? Is the same guy that it's in the painting from her room. Well he was handsome. Get one bullet. Look what an impressive picture! What do you think? The painter is a lesbian named Carmen, she dedicated to her mother. That's why the title, "To the author of my desire". Amazing, isn't it? You don't Like it very much. Do you? Yes, is very good. Yes. The texture has quality. - And the color. - What a way of working colors. I knew you were going to Like it. It's similar to your theme, right? And what about the painter, she continues exhibiting? No. Why not? Because of her thematic? One day, when the intolerance is defeated, this picture... will have an honor place at a museum, but not now. In these days it's necessary to see the violence provoke... against the art. And not only in Guadalajara in New York was... ...bombastic the Last Supper, with a black hooker in Christ's place. Several weeks ago, Carmen's corpse was found in drainage. Horrible! I'm sorry. They still don't know anything about her friend, named Raquel. Carmen had a great future as a painter, her work was... ...characterized by the anguish. Is there someone implied in her death? Several of her models were interrogated, hookers... ...but there was no evidence found. She died near here, and they all reside in the Federal District. And nobody knows anything? They spent a weekend with me. When they left I had the... ...feeling that something was going to happen. I didn't hear from them until the horrible news. Carmen was shoot in the face, then mutilated and thrown... ...then mutilated and thrown into drainage. The police came to interrogate me, I told them what I knew. Carmen always repeated, how much her mother hated her. That she was a freak. She threatened her many... ...times with an exemplary punishment. And you're not afraid? In this big house, by your-self. - No. - At least you have a gun? I don't know how to use them. I don't fear death. If somebody for example forced me to face it... from the eternity I'll be vastly grateful. At my years solitude, weights too much. - What happened buddy?. - You know what man? This pisses me off. The maid continues hanging around. If you see her again, tell me. Move, you don't let me piss in peace. Look what I found... in the room of the Lady Open Mind. You found something? No, it's just a friendship letter. For now the only evidence we have is a gun that she denies. - And that we found the picture. - I'll call Don Joaquin... and see if it coincides with the one that killed the lesbian. You want the extra money, man. What are you thinking about? I Like to listen to music. Would you Like a whisky, or a digestive? - I'm fine thank you. - For me another tequila. They say it's good for the digestion. Yes, It's what I drink. But tonight I'll have a... ...whisky on your honor. You want it straight or with soda? - With soda. - Ice? - Yes, I serve the ice. - Thank you. Can I serve you a drink? I have Cognac. No really, I drank too much red wine, I had enough. - Here. - Thank you. Ask for what ever you want. I'm here to attend to you. - Cheers! - Cheers! It's bad luck not to drink a toast. I'm not superstitious. My mom loved that music. - You Like it? - Very much. Let's dance. This music is back in fashion. The new generation will enjoy so beautiful compositions. This was the first song I danced with Francisco. You loved him? With all my heart. You were faithful? - Even now. - Really?. And you never let one's... hair down. I'm not Like you. I can't. This will sound strange. I'm a very conventional lady. I never go out. I respect my husband's memory. Why are you here? How long have you being working here? - Three weeks. - Don't lie. I swear, ask her. Really ask her! Besides I don't care if she kicks me out. Why do you do things that she doesn't Like? - I swear I won't spy again. - I'm waiting. I wanted to see you naked. She Likes that her guests get naked. - Don't fuck with me. - Really there are no morals... ...in this house, everybody knows that. - Are you sure? - No, but what I know is... that she has obscene magazines and worst things. Books that talk about communism and how to... ...become an outstanding terrorist. - Really?. - Yes. Let's sit down. I didn't want to offend you. Maybe it's my fault. It seems that nothing... scandalizes me, but when I'm involved I don't know... how to handle it. No, I'm the one who has to be ashamed. I can't help it, I'm very conservative with myself. And where is your friend? I don't know, he was here a minute ago. And who are you? It's just that you look different. Don't change the subject. They say that, she was decent when her husband was still alive. He was very extravagant and a communist to the core. So they say he perverted her. And since she's a widow, you know the devil touches... ...people who are alone. She also says she's Catholic, and non of her friends believe in God. And why are you still here? Everybody tells me that, but... Nobody from here Likes her. And they even want to burn her house. Are you leaving tomorrow? - You want us to stay more days? - Yes. Would you Like to die young? No! - No? - Of course not! What makes you say that? You really surprise me, now you're not as homosexual... ...as you pretend, also you completely lack of the... romantic spirit. I have to leave you locked in, and don't make noise. - Stay quiet OK? - Yes sir. - What? - Yes sir! Fucking faggot! The society is able to destroy any person, only for their honest conduct. Honesty is Like to show yourself naked... and is forbidden. Where were you man! I just went for a walk. A tequila will revive you. But just a little bit. I knew you weren't going to despise me. That's OK. - Cheers! - Cheers! For love! He was dying to dance. You want to dance? I'm joking man, sit down. I remember my childhood with this music. My mom Liked it very much. It doesn't bring you back childhood memories? We played marbles... And so many other games. Keep it up and you'll be plastered. Remember why we're here. Don't fuck it up. Let's have some fun. For you Francisco! For that soon our ashes get mixed. I found the maid spying. I left her locked up. GiIberto your man is waiting for you. You see, we don't lose anything by dancing. Or what... Are you afraid to be jinxed. I believe... that the maid is also a spy. For whom? I don't know. But at least she had luck. Not Like us that we have to be someone that we hate. We shouldn't have accepted this job. Just remember that nobody will pay, what they have paid us. Besides you're getting married soon. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't accept. We have to do something with the maid. She can't interfere with us. I love it; you both are so handsome! So she doesn't suspect; give me a kiss. Don't fuck with me. You want me to continue? Yes continue. Let's do something with the maid. As a demonstration was enough. You're drunk, aren't you bro? Is just that I feel fine. I feel happy. She's very cool. And the house is great. You know what bro? I believe that... She wouldn't hurt anybody. Not even any of her guests. She's the coolest lady I have met in my whole life. Come on drink. Don't fuck with me! Don't be so touchy! GiIberto, what do you think of crime? The painter's crime? No, the crime in general. I consider that the crime and the loving acts form a unit. They're Like a coin of two faces. Aren't they?. Life and death, love and hate. Eternal truths. Crime doesn't exist in the indifference of the universe. The husband kills his infidel wife because he loves her. The violator murderers his victims, even though... according to him, he only wants to express his love. I don't know if you understand me? For example the Fascist has to destroy all germs void... of immorality. Because deep down it alters and fascinates him. The thief kills the rich because he wants to be Like him. I believe that crime is caused by the absence of satisfied sexuality. Is the face of frustration. Of envy recognition and negation of instincts. Terrible opposition that death could generate. And what do you think? For love! Cheers! You're fired! She doesn't want to see you again. You gossip! You should be more discreet. Pair of faggots! Repeat what you just said, stupid! - Has the cat got your tongue? - Cat; my balls! What did you say! Pair of faggots! How do you see our co-worker? She's screwed... What you want first or seconds? You choose. - You're later. - You can't. You'll see. But first bitch;... Take your clothes off! Go one, take it off! - I can take care. - Let go! - Come on! - Let go! Faster! - And so? - And? It's enough as a punishment, OK? Move! - What is it man? - I think she's a virgin. From the ears, you jerk. I'm serious, I don't know, the way she undresses her body. Besides I can't be an ass right now. - Maybe you want. - I want... - ... but with you! - Fuck you, ass hole. What is it man? You can't take a joke? If you have the hots for her, go for it! - It will take her down a notch. - I would love to screw. Hey! For the Little pussy! - You won't enjoy it. - Whatever! - Ass hole! - Lay down there! Do it! I don't care if he gets pissed off! From now on, be careful with what you say. My Dad always said... If you spill the beans; you're fucked. I hope you die. Everybody... everybody will die. Even you. You better not feel any resentment against me... Because we both enjoy it. I know females very well. Please, leave me alone. I can please you again. No, please, no! You were right... She was a virgin! Really?. I'm kidding. Why the fuck did I stay! Damn her! She worth's a lot. She worth's nothing. - A moral crude. - What the fuck! You should have seen her... She was Like a Little lamb. Besides... There was something in her frown... something strange... I feel very bad. Hopefully, you'll go to hell! No man, you're also pissed off. Don't fuck with me, we came to work, and you are just drinking and fucking! You ass hole, you're jealous because you couldn't fuck her. Me jealous! I went first man. But first it was your turn, it's not my problem. Not my problem. Is she still there? I don't know. I have a bad feeling with all this. You drunkard! Where are you going? - And now what do you want? - Now is my turn. - Where are you going? - Aren't you going to complain. - What do you have there? - My things. Open it! "Contemporary Polish Theater" And what about here? - What! - What is this? My things, gifts from the Lady. You fucking liar! Come here! Please, leave me alone! Please! This has been the worst night of my Life. - Take off your blouse! - Wait! Your blouse, take it off! Imagine that I'm a boy. Don't mess with me. I can screw you. - Go back with your boyfriend. - Don't fuck with me! - Go with him. - Don't! I was also in love. Don't do a stupid thing. Go with him! You found love with him. Go with him! "Dulcinea my love, is this the garden of roses that you promised me". "Dulcinea my love, is this... "The storm appease the worms of the path" "Aren't the placentas what destroy your desires". "The labyrinths ashes are dispersed by the canal of frustration". "Go and tell the owl to stop baying". I don't want it! It's an owl! What is it buddy?. - Yellow Like the grass. - What man! While all shout that has to suggest it! I'll take you to the room. Hey you! You boy! Mrs. Josefina! A lot of love that I had to go through... - You're burning! - Let go! Let go! Don't go with the... With the... Go and tell the carpenter that he's an enormous cat... Enormous... Mrs. Josefina? Mrs. Josefina? Hail Mary full of grace, The Lord is with thee;... Blessed are you among woman, and blessed is the... fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, The Lord is with thee;... Blesses are you among woman, and blessed is the... fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God,... Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen. Hail Mary full of grace, The Lord is with thee;... Blessed are you among woman, and blessed is the... fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen. - You heard a shot? - No. What is it GiIberto? - Alfonso... he has a fever. - Who? Alejandro, he's very sick. - We have to do something. - Come. Exists a sea arm. The cigarette end give's... - What is it? - He must be intoxicated. We need a doctor! I have a dairy in my room, call doctor LomeIi. The ink of the corner... Where should we use the... Why is there not enough... The feet samples... Slip Like castles... Yes, it's an emergency. How long? That long? OK, we'll wait. Fuck! - How is he? - Very bad. What do we do? You have a car? My chauffeur takes it on the weekends, we have to walk. Alfonso! Alfonso! Wake up man! Wake up! Wake up! He's a terrible colleague. He left me with all the work. I'm sorry. I leave you a moment with him. Are you praying for my dead friend? What cynicism. How many people are in your list? It's strange, that you being so intelligent. You haven't notice the maid's absence. - Raquel? - Yes, Raquel. You can write her name down in your deceased List. I killed that fucking lesbian. I understand your desperation, please don't play with death. Congratulations, you're an excellent hostess. Old way of seducing your victims. Calm down, GiIberto... Don't call me GiIberto! My name is Javier,... And the one you killed was Alfonso. You can shoot if you want, I don't fear death. The autopsy will indicate the cause of your friend's death. Why did you hide the lesbian? To defend her of the world violence, from the... intolerance of whom murdered Carmen. Give me the gun. Don't do anything stupid. If you want, I can give you a tranquilizer. Like you gave Alfonso; to kill him. Don't you recognize it? - Why so many questions? - Answer! It was my husband's. Is that a problem. You say it for the painter. I never had a gun in my hands. All the evidence is against you. Not even the devil will save you You're being delirious. So many conjectures don't make sense. I'm sure of something. Neither Alfonso nor I are gays! We're not! We're here to carry out an assignment. You're the most perverse person, I have ever met. The worst is that you acknowledge it. I'll never be a pussy! I'm not a fag! I'll never be one! Neither Alfonso! If something I admired him. Was... was.. I was once in a similar situation knowing that Life snatched... ...from us our dears love. It produces a terrible... ...paranoia, we feel guilty. We want to scream. To hit Life. You solved this case all by yourself. You will take the whole merit. Don Joaquin? - I'm alive by a miracle. - Where? At the Hacienda, I was drugged and when I woke up... Alfonso was dead; but first he killed Mrs. Josefina, and the maid; that turned out to be the Raquel. She didn't have a breast, right? They call her, "The Amazon". I have the last piece of the puzzle. The oil painting. It's necessary to call the police, but not a word of... - ... the painting. All right? - Yes. And of course the extra pay, will be for you. Consider it as a wedding gift from your best friend. Good evening. Everything was how we planned it. And of course I have the painting. I'll do that. "To the author of my desires".
