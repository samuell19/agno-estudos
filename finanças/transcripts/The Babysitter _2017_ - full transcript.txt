*** Subtitles by dylux *** I don't need it. I'm telling you. Just because you don't feel sick now doesn't mean you don't need the shot. I never get sick, okay? You can take that and give it to Barry. - His nose is always running. - What are you giving me shit for? I saw you earlier today. We said hi. I said, "Cole." You said, "Mr. Daisy." Why are you giving me shit today? I mean, it's just a needle, man. Damn. Come here, get the shot. Ain't nothing to be scared of. There's 62 kids came here, got a shot, no problem. You come in here, take ten minutes? I got 84 kids more to go. Okay? We're boys. Be cool. Shit, man. Are you gonna take this shot? Step over here and take the shot, just like you'd take some ass. There's nothing to be scared of. I'm not scared. (COLE SCREAMING) Pussy! (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) (MELANIE) Did you know only one baby was born on the Mayflower? How crazy is that shit? His name was literally Oceanus. He didn't even have a nationality. Just a citizen of the sea, I guess. What class did you learn that in? (SCOFFS) No one learns anything in class. That's why we have the Internet. (RAP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) (MELANIE SIGHS) There's my dad. (MELANIE'S DAD) Melanie, get over here. It was his high-school dream car. He got it after the divorce to make Mom jealous, but... - it didn't work because it's a car. - (MELANIE'S DAD) Now. Dad, can we give Cole a ride home? Cole, are your parents expecting you to take the bus home? - I guess so. - Yeah, they are. So, you should take the bus, okay, sport? Sorry, dude. I'll see you, though, neighbor, huh? - I didn't... - What's that? (ENGINE REVVING) - NASCAR Nation, bitch. Whoo! - (MELANIE) Dad... (MELANIE) Dad! (JEREMY) Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Well, well, well. (JEREMY) Hey, Colonoscopy. How's it hanging? I don't know. Okay? Well, speaking of hanging, have your balls dropped yet? - (BOYS LAUGHING) - (COLE MUMBLING) I didn't catch that. I said, "Why are you so interested in my balls?" Last thing he cares about is your balls. (JEREMY) Yeah, 'cause on Saturday, I hooked up with Shelly MacEntyre. The sophomore? The sophomore. But in many ways, she was a senior. - I don't believe you. - You don't need to believe him. It's not like your belief will validate what happens to his dick. Wanna know how it was? No, not really. Well, see, as a 14-year-old in that kind of situation with a 16-year-old that looks like Shelly MacEntyre, it was overwhelming, man. I mean, she is a woman. Fully-developed, man. It's crazy, man. It's... (GRUNTS) Man, you know what I'm saying? I said, do you know what I'm saying? You just said it didn't matter if I believed you. - Well, I changed my mind, bitch. - Sorry, I wasn't... (JEREMY) Oh, my God. He's so weird. (LAUGHS) Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. (WOMAN) Hey! Did you just touch Cole? - So, what if I did? - (WOMAN) Jeremy, check it out.

Before I run you over, you little Pap smear. - Hey, Coley. - (COLE) Hey, Bee. These are new. Yeah, I have to wear them sometimes. They supposedly help strengthen my left eye, - but I can't tell the difference. - You look pretty strong to me. You skin your palms? - It doesn't hurt. - Yeah, it does. Come here. - They bother you a lot? - No. You look away when you lie, dude. They the ones that egg your house? (SIGHS, CLICKS TONGUE) You gotta punch them in the dick. And if they're chasing you, wait until they've almost got you, drop like a bag of rocks, then when they trip over you, and they're on the ground, kick them in the dick. - Hey, so, tell me, how's the folks? - Better, I think. Hotel therapy's working? (CHUCKLES) No, come on, it's great. I mean, they're happy, we get to hang out, and I get paid. - I'm like your little Protestant. - (CHUCKLES) What? 'Cause, like, I have to pay you to hang out with me. Are you trying to say "prostitute"? Oh, my God... No, that would make me the prostitute and your parents the clients. That is a terrible analogy. That is the worst one ever. - Oh... - Besides, I'd wanna hang out with you either way. Really? One hundred percent. I got two years tops before you're too cool to hang out with me. I'll never be too cool. (BEE) Hey, is that the roof of your tree house? (COLE) Yeah, we just started to take it down. I... I don't care. I mean, my, uh... Tree houses are for kids anyway.

Cole. Cole, can you hand me one of those traps, please? Ow. - Thanks. Hi. - Hi. (GRUNTS) Thanks, buddy. (GROANS) God. God. Mom, how can you be under there? There's like a trillion spiders. (MOM) Cole, I don't like it under here. It's pretty much the worst. - Do you think I'm a pussy, Mom? - (THUD) Ow. (MOM) Do you know what that word means? - (COLE) Yeah, like, afraid of everything. - Ow. Um... Huh. Well... (SIGHS) I think... you are at a time in your life where a lot of things are scary. But as you get older, those same things will stop frightening you as much. Okay? It's gonna be okay. (COLE) You should really get some bug spray to kill the spiders in there. What have they done to you? They eat other dirty bugs. Hey, will you get me a lemonade? - Yep. - Thanks. Mom, I know "pussy" also means "vagina." I'm not retarded. Cole Johnson. Do not say "retarded." - But I can say "pussy" or "vagi..." - (DRILL WHIRRING) Don't say it, okay? Go get me a lemonade. Oh, my God, he said "pussy." (MAN) Breathe in.

I went on the Internet, and there's pictures of them. They die like this: Maybe next week. All right, buddy, sure. You wanna swap? - Yeah. - Good. All right. You did good. You started the car, you put the seat belt on. Don't worry about it, pal. There's no rush. It's okay to be scared. It's not a big deal, okay? Hey, let me ask you something. Do your friends... Do they make fun of you for having a babysitter? Yeah. But then they see her and get really jealous. Yeah. Heck, yeah, they do. (CHUCKLES) I don't know about you, buddy, but I'm feeling like a cop. I'm craving some donuts. (SHOUTING) (DAD) All right! (BOTH LAUGHING) What are you watching? Your dad is bingeing on Mad Men. Again. You wouldn't like it. It's on HBO? - (CHUCKLES) - No, it's not... It's not dirty, buddy. It's not on HBO. It's dense, you know. So, it might go over your head. When you get a little older, we'll binge-watch it together. How about that? - (COLE) All right. - Cole, will you clean up the toys in the hallway for me? Okay, Mom. Jeez. Thank you. (COLE) Much cleaner. Who cares? Hey. Oh. Hey, that doesn't seem safe at all. - I can handle it. - Yeah. No, I get it. Stop. Stop. And hand me the knife. Fabulous. Why you cutting up your car with a knife? I'm gonna switch the roof with a fastback, - so it's aerodynamic. - Uh-huh. It's gonna give me more downforce on the turns. When it hits the ramp, it'll do a barrel roll and smash into the crash zone exactly how I intend... Got it, got it. I applaud your passion for aerodynamics. I absolutely do, but only use this if you're cutting a flank steak. And don't do that. That's my job. And if you take that job, what am I doing at this house? Do you want me to put it back? (DAD) No. I'm gonna put this in the dishwasher, 'cause it's coated in my sweat and fear. My parents are going away again. I think they go to have sex, but it just makes me feel like they go to get away from me. They're definitely having sex. They probably have sex when you're home, too. Besides, I bet Bee has boys over at your place all the time doing it. Nope. No. No way. Not a chance. Yeah. That's what babysitters do. They put the kids down, sneak their boyfriends in. Doing it.

Well, the Jews have their scrolls, Christians have their Bibles, and the devil has his verses. Don't touch it. It's very old and very delicate. It's the only one. You recite the verse while the blood hits the page. Without it, none of this happens. Let's get started before we head upstairs and get the blood of the innocent. (GASPS) (WOMAN) 911, what's your emergency? My name is Cole Johnson. A guy was murdered in my living room. The address is, uh... 2455 Bigby Drive. - Can you please send someone? - Are the attackers still in the house? They're downstairs having a blast. - How many are there, Cole? - Too many. Can you please get my mom? She's at the Hyatt in the city. Living large. Of course, Cole. Now listen to me. It's important that you stay hidden. - I gotta protect myself. Thanks. - Do not do that. No, no, no... - Okay. - (CHATTERING) (BEE) ...we shed about 15 percent of our dead cells. (JOHN) Whoo! Yo, this kid's hobby must be getting bullied. He's reading The Secret? He's ten years old. What secret he need to know? Won't he hear us? With the amount of drugs I gave him? Hell, no. - (SONYA) Good boy. Pretty boy. - Do you have the needle? Of course, I have the needle. You know, there is a faster way to get all that blood. (BEE) What happens when you kill someone? (JOHN) They lose, like, all they Instagram followers. - (GASPS) Oh, my God, that would suck. - No, they die. And then I'd have to find another innocent kid. And all of this only works if we get that top-shelf pure shit. And Cole is basically a faucet of that for us. (BEE) After this, we finish the ritual... and your wish comes true. - Damn, I missed the vein. - (SONYA) Mm. (BEE) Premium real estate. Go for it. (SONYA INCANTING) Wait, you gotta give him a Band-Aid. Okay. Let's go mix some blood. John, alley-oop. (JOHN) LeBron James. Good boy. (PANTING) Why is he shirtless? - That's your first question? - How can you ask that? Just look at him. I still don't get it. (GRUNTING) Give him a cookie. - No, thanks. - Eat the cookie. I just don't really like cookies, okay? Bee knows that. You'll feel better if you eat. You fainted. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. After I took your blood, I waited in the room, because something felt off. I crouched behind the door. A few seconds later, you got up, tied a sheet to your bed, threw the sheet out the window. And then you fainted. So, you know... Your blood sugar is low. Eat the cookie. Are you mad at me? Cookie. This is gonna be so good. What the... Oh, there you go. There you go. That's a good boy. - Why are you awake, Cole? - Because I couldn't sleep. - I don't believe you. - (COLE) Okay, fine. I... I was gonna go smoke in the woods. (BEE) You were gonna go smoke in the woods. Yeah. You know, like... marijuana. You weren't gonna share with your boy? Come on, man. We could've got high, listen to my mix tape. My shit's fire. - I wanna smoke pot. - Why didn't you drink the shot? Why is he shirtless? Why did you take my blood? - Cole. - Okay. Fine. Because I don't like alcohol. I just drank it because I wanted you to think I was cool. Why did you give a 12-year-old alcohol? 'Cause I put shit in that alcohol that makes them conk out for eight hours or more. What else did you see? I just see you. And these assholes, who I don't know, in my house. - Why is his shirt covered in blood? - No one would let me borrow a shirt. - That's not even an answer. - Oh, my God. Does he not see the mirror behind him? We can see you cutting the rope. Well, he does now. Aw, it's so cute, you're still cutting the rope. Look at you. You're really trying there, aren't you? - Why are you cutting ropes? - I don't like being tied up. - Why do you have a knife? - It was a gift. Oh, my God. He's still cutting the ropes. Determined little fucker, aren't you? Look, I won't tell anyone. Okay? You know me. I'm good with secrets. I won't tell my parents that you were having an orgy and needed my blood to do it. (JOHN AND ALLISON LAUGHING) Do you even know what an orgy is? I'm guessing it's something sad people do 'cause they want other sad people to like them, and they can forget for one minute how sad they are in general. That's actually a pretty good answer. It was for a science project, okay? The orgy? No. The blood. Orgy is when a bunch of people have sex together. We wouldn't need your blood for that. You could've just asked. I would've let you have some blood for science. I knew you were afraid of needles. This was clearly a misunderstanding. Sonya, untie him. I'm sorry we scared you, Cole. We good? (POLICE SIRENS WAILING) - (JOHN) Oh, shit. - (SCREAMING) - (MAX) Shut up! - Holy fuck! - Not good. - Fucking police. Why are the cops outside, Cole? - I don't know. - Did you call them? - No. You said you were in the room. - Makes me think you saw something that scared you enough to call the cops.

Can we just stick a tampon in it or something? Oh, my God. We need to call an ambulance, guys. I need an ambulance. I don't wanna lose my boob. I can't do that. (ALLISON) What? Why not? Because your boob was shot by a now-dead cop. Have fun explaining that. No dude's gonna motorboat these, Bee. - (CRYING) - (MIMICKING MOTORBOAT) How you like it?

(GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) What the hell was that? You must be crazy. Jeremy, you have to listen to me, okay? There's a guy over there who's trying to kill me. - I swear to God. - I swear to God. - I'm serious. - I'm serious. There are dead bodies in my house. - Wait, seriously? - The cops came. They killed the cops. - Where is the cop car? - They're crazy. They're covering it up. Okay? If you get me out of this, I'll wear a blue headband. I'll give you foot massages. I'll do your homework until college. Oh, okay, okay. I'll help you. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, if you die, who am I gonna pick on? Exactly. Okay, so, here's the plan. On three, we're gonna make a run for my bike. - You're gonna ride in the back. All right? - Thank you. One, two... (JEREMY LAUGHING) Have fun getting murdered, colon cancer. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. You talk too much. Crack him in the face next time. Not bad. At least you stood up for yourself. You gonna let me go now?

Killed the cops. - You're really freaking me out. - I'm... sorry. Bee is bad? Yeah. Bee is bad. - Where's your dad? - Out with some Protestant. - But his car's here. - She picked him up. He's really desperate. Am I the only one that still has a babysitter? Yeah. - So, what do we do? - Pray. - Okay. - I was kidding. - Oh. - But it's probably a great idea, though. (BOTH GASP) Come on. - You think she can get in here? - Not if it's locked. (COLE) Your door automatically locks, right? (MELANIE) Nope. (GASPS) (PHONE BUZZES AND JINGLE PLAYS) (GUN COCKS) (PANTS) - I shouldn't have gotten you into this. - You were being shot at. Especially because I was being shot at. You're my best friend, I'm sorry. I'm gonna take care of this. - Do you have your phone? - Yeah. - Call the cops. Tell them it's a 10-53. - Why do you know cop codes? Because I used to wanna be a cop when I grew up. You never told me that. I know. I only told Bee. (DUSTY SPRINGFIELD'S "SPOOKY" PLAYING) Are you okay?
