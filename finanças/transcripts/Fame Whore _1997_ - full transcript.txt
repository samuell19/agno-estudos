(suspenseful music) (people talking) (camera clicking) - Good morning. (camera clicking) - [Paparazzi] Jody George, you've been called the bad boy of tennis, what do you have to say for yourself? - No, no, no, no. - Fuck your mom. - No, no, no, no questions. We'll have time for that later. (people shouting) They'll be times for questions at the press conference later. - Want an exclusive? 7030 Mile Shaw, alright. (paparazzi talking) - [Male Paparazzi] Why so much hostility to the press, Jody? - [Male Paparazzi] Jody George, you're number one in the world, what do you have to say for yourself? (all paparazzi talking) - Where the fuck were you when I was number one? I mean. Alright, I'm number one now. Where the fuck were you before that? All you mother fuckers - That's enough, thank you. can suck my dick. (paparazzi shouting) - That's enough, thank you. We'll have more questions later at the press conference. Thank you, bye. - What about those fuckheads, huh? - Jody, you cannot talk to the press like that. - Oh, bullshit, man. - No, just-- - Just like I was saying, man. - Just smile and nod, can you try that? Can you do it? Smile. Like hi, and nod. And then, you don't say - Fuck you. anything, that's how you do it. (barking) - Rosco, here, was kept chained to a furnace in a basement for two years straight and fed nothing but stale, white bread. Luckily, we liberated the poor fellow and nursed him back to health. I'm positive that we'll be able to find him a good home soon. Spike's owner ran him over three times with his sedan as punishment for shredding a Dakunan print. He was left for dead in a garbage can but were miraculously able to save his life. And, little Siah, here, was found wandering aimlessly through a neighborhood with no tags or identification but with a horrible infestation of tapeworms. She's responded well to her treatment and we should soon have her in a new and happy home. (barking) - How are the mutts this morning, George? - They're fine, Mr. Peepers. Little Siah is responding well to her tapeworm medication and anti-diarrhea pills. - New tie, George? - Ah, yes, Mr. Peepers. You know the rules, this is my desk and you have your space here in the corner. Come on. - Alright, George. - Today is April 15th, the start of National Beagle week and we've got three bouncing beagles to find homes for. (ringing) My, my, they sure know how to keep a guy on his toes in this place. Hello, Urban Dog Placement Center, this is George speaking. - Hi, George. Listen to this. (farting) - Is this your idea of a prank? (farting) Well, I don't think it's very funny. (farting) That's right, I'm hanging up the phone. (farting) You heard me, buster, I'm hanging up the phone now. Darn it, Mr. Peepers, this world is full of barbarians. - Yes it is, George. By the way, have you seen my tick spray? ♫ Fame whore ♫ I always want more more more ♫ Baby I'm a fame whore ♫ Can't you give me more more more ♫ I won't stop now 'til I win that race ♫ And the fucking paparazzi memorize my face ♫ I ain't got talent and I ain't got style ♫ But if there's a camera around ♫ Then I've got the smile ♫ Baby I'm a fame whore ♫ I always want more more more ♫ Baby I'm a fame whore ♫ Can't you give me more more more ♫ I've got my agent and I'm gonna be a star ♫ I promise you honey ♫ I'm gonna go far ♫ I don't need love and I don't need you ♫ I'm a fame whore baby ♫ That's what I do ♫ I'm a photographer ♫ I'm an actress ♫ I'm a fashion designer and more ♫ I'm a dancer ♫ I'm a film director ♫ I'm an artist ♫ I'm a fucking bore ♫ I don't need talent ♫ I'm gonna make a splash ♫ All I need is my youth and a bundle of cash ♫ I don't need talent ♫ I'm gonna make a splash ♫ All I need is my youth and a bundle of cash - The new issue of M Magazine has some back stage photos from fashion week. Oh my god, here I am. Here I am, I'm in the new issue of M. I'm in the new issue of M. - Where, I don't believe you. - [Sophie] Here, I'm right here standing next to Rhonda. That 13 year old model. - [J] I don't see you. - [Sophie] Here I am, J, that's my arm. How 'bout that, J, I'm in the new issue of M. - Get real, Sophie. - That's my arm in the magazine, J. You're just jealous because you've never made the paparazzi page in any of these magazines. Oh, here I am again. This time, The Scene. - Where? - Here, this photo of the Vicewoods Ball. I'm in the back corner. - That's not you. And, even if it is, who cares. That photo is microscopic and your back seems to be turned. - That is me, J, here, take a look through this. - Okay, Sophie, you're right. That is you. The dandruff should've been the giveaway. - Well, J, we've got a big day ahead of us. We've got to come up with a production schedule for my new line of clothing. We're also shooting that music video with all of those models. And, on top of that, we've got to get my taxes done. It is April 15th today. J, where are my lung pills? - I don't know, where'd you put them last? - Listen, J, you're my assistant. You are supposed to keep track of these things. Now, find me that bottle of lung pills while I take care of this unfinished business. (bubbling) - Where we going? - I'm taking you to a new hotel. That last one was crawling with too much press scum. - Hey, when does Jody George get a few days off, huh? - Don't hold your breath. You've got an exhibition match the day after tomorrow. - Oh, man. Can't Jody George skip it? - No. Come on, let us skip it. - No, no. There's 150K guaranteed and I've already cashed the check. - Oh, fuck. - After the match, it's off to Florida for a week of conditioning. Then, to Paris for the tournament. - Paris, Jody George hates the fucking French. Their tournament sucks fucking pig ass. You know it does. What's my guarantee there? - 350. - 350 thousand? - Yeah. - Fuck that, Jody George wants more. You know god damn well the frogs are paying Mack, what, 350K 10 years ago when he was number two in the world. Fuck that lame French shit. - We made that agreement with the French at the beginning of the season when you were ranked number six in the world. It's too late to renegotiate. - Fuck that, Jody George wants more. They'll increase I guarantee I'll call in sick and fuck their whole tournament. - You can't do that. - Why not? - Because I already promised our sponsors that you will play the tournament. - Why not? - I just told you why not. - Fuck. Fuck! - Do you have a phone I could use by any chance? - It's out of order. - Okay. - [Sophie] What is this stuff, J? - It's your business cards from the printers. - Fabulous, fabulous. Now, let's make sure they didn't short us. I ordered 100,000. Let me see one while you're at it. Oh my god, they fucked up. It's all about Sopie, it's supposed to be Sophie. S - O - P - H - I - E, Sophie, not Sopie. J, what are you laughing at? This card makes absolutely no sense. It's horrible. - Well, we'll just have to send them back to the printers and have them all reprinted. - What are you talking about? Are you cuckoo? We have no time for that. Here, I want you to fix them. - But, there's 100,000, Sophie. - Well, get to work then, J. I want the job complete A.S.A.P. I've got clients on my list to give that card to. It's my identity. Now chop chop. - Me. - What is it, George? - Mr. Peepers, we've just found a home for one of our beagles. - Whoopee. Is it time for lunch yet? - Remember that nice, elderly woman who came in here a couple of days ago? - You mean that smelly, old bat? - Mr. Peepers, you're not being very nice. - No, George, I'm not being very nice. - Well, she just called to say she was interested in adopting one of our beagles. - That, George, is a new twist. An owner who smells worse than her new pooch. Good show. (ringing) Hello, Urban Dog Placement Center, this is George speaking. - Hi, George, I got a puppy from you the other day and it's pissing all over my quilt. I think you gave me a defective dog. - Now, please, calm down. - Calm down, you want me to calm down when I have piss all over my fancy quilt. I'm gonna sue you for the damage. That damn puppy ruined some valuable, museum quality quilts. - [Sophie] Isn't she lovely? - [J] Who is she? - What are you talking about, J, it's me, Sophie. - This is not you. You are dreaming, Sophie. - Yes it is me, J, I am this beautiful. Of course, it was scanned through a computer but that's besides the point. Now, I want you to shut up because I have an important phone call to make. (fun music) (beeping) (ringing) Hello, this is Sophie. I'd like to speak to Lenny. Yes, Sophie, S - O - P - H - I - E. No, there is no last name, it's just Sophie. Listen, does Madonna need a last name? Does Cher need a last name? Do you get my drift? Thank you. Hi, Lenny, I just got my head shots today. They look great. Listen, I'll do any type of film work. Comedy, action, drama. But, Lenny. No arty independent type projects. Okay. Great. Call me when you have some leads on the auditions. Alright. Bye, Lenny. - What was that about? - That, J, was the one and only Lenny Bernstein. - Lenny Bernstein? The Lenny Bernstein? - I swear, J, you are so ignorant. Lenny Bernstein is one of the most powerful casting agents in Hollywood. He's the guy who invented the term brat pack. And, he's handling my acting career. - Your acting career? - Let's move on, J, let's move on. We've got so much to do and so little time. Now, tell me, what's happening with my line? - Line? - The fashion line, J, the fashion line. Get me a model and give me a presentation in 15 minutes. Chop, chop. - [Presenter] Our investor suite represents the height of luxury and opulence. Equipped with six telephones, private voicemail and email with personal security code. In-room fax and copier. Three televisions wired to satellite and 356 channels of international entertainment. Our investor suite has been designed to provide the discerning dignitary with the utmost in sophistication. - Well, here we are, gentlemen. - So, this is it, huh? - Yes, sir, Mr. George. Our last guest was Tatiana Grand. She had a fabulous time here. - Well, I'm glad and I hope the cleaning crew did a good job because I don't wanna find any of her pussy hairs on my toilet seat. - [Bellhop] Yes, sir. I'm sure you'll find your toilet seat spotless, sir. - Johnny, yeah, yeah. - You know what, Jody George has something for ya. - [Manager] No, we just got here. - Well, thank you, sir. - Yeah, you bet. This ball, someday, my little Adi, is gonna be worth a lot of money. - [Manager] Yeah, yeah, the place is fine. - So, don't you let your dog. - [Manager] Well, you know. - Chew it the fuck up. - Yes, sir. - Alright? - He has his own agenda. - Thank you, sir. - Get the fuck outta here. (rock and roll music) ♫ So you got something inside you ♫ What I got ♫ Been around that and I know ♫ There's nothing new to you ♫ You're just a saboteur ♫ A stupid saboteur (ringing) - Hello, Urban Dog Placement Center, this is George speaking. - Hello, George, I have this problem with my dog. - Okay, well maybe, I can help you. - Well, see, I have this Great Dane and usually he's really well behaved. But, every time I make love to him, he starts acting really weird. - Is this a crank call? - George, my man, I love to fuck my great dane's ass. - He does my dog, man. - Listen, here, fella. I don't have time for your monkey business. Now, goodbye. - And, who was that? - Darn it, Mr. Peepers, that was another one of those stupid crank calls. They're beginning to drive me crazy. - Now, now, George. Don't let them get to you. Remember my motto, fuck 'em all. Fuck 'em all. - Fuck 'em all. It's an interesting thought. Fuck 'em all. - Jody George will fuck that pussy. Fucking Jody George would fuck that momma, too. - [Woman On TV] Kiss my boot, lick them. - [Woman On TV] Yes, that's lovely, thank you. Thank you so much. - Aw, yeah, aw, fucking suck my fucking big, athletic cock, you fucking skeezy ho. - [Woman On TV] Oh, oh, oh. - Yeah. - [Woman On TV] Cheers, cheers, cheers. Thanks a lot, thanks a lot. - Aw, shit. Aw, shit, fucking big butt Italian ass whopper. There she go. There she go, there she go 'cause she Jody George ho.

(rock and roll music) ♫ Whatever it is you have ♫ I'm sure I want it ♫ Whatever it is you said ♫ I'm sure fooled ♫ You're fucking boring - [Sophie] What's your name, honey? - Turquoise. - What agency are we with? - I'm with Downtown Agency. - Have you worked in Europe? - Was I supposed to? - Well, Turquoise, that will be enough. You may go now. - Thank you. - Sophie, I don't know if it was my imagination or not but was that boy giving us shade? - You know something, J, I think you're right. Definite shade. Tear up his file, I never wanna see his face in here again. - Me neither. God, I hate stuck up model pussy. - You know something, J. I wanna call this new line Femanatomy by Sophie. What do you think? - You know, Sophie, I really don't like this collection. - J, I'm thinking about selling the collection in art galleries, maybe, unveiling it when my painting show opens next month. - Don't you think that tiny T-shirts have been done to death? - J. My line is completely original. Completely new, it even has a political edge. - Sorry to burst your bubble. But, tiny T-shirts were out four seasons ago. - J, this is a ground-breaking collection. If you cannot recognize that than you must be a retard. (ringing) - Yes, hello, it's all about Sophie. Yes, hold on a moment, please. It's your Uncle Lenny, the casting agent. - Hello, Lenny. Yes. Yes. Oh my god, Lenny, that's fabulous, fabulous. Okay. Okay, bye. - [J] What was that about? - Lenny got me an audition. It's for the female lead in the film version of Cats. Ha, this is so wonderful. Now, where's that phone. I've gotta call my acting coach and schedule a refresher session A.S.A.P. But, first. Some marijuana. (suspenseful music) What is that stuff, J? - It's from the Black and White Lab. It must be the proofs from yesterday's photo shoot. - You know something, J. I have a really good feeling about these shots. I was on a roll yesterday. - You were possessed, Sophie. - J, if these shots are good, we've got that account. I tell you, I'm a natural at this photography thing. I've got a great eye and a great sense of composition, if I do say so myself. - Enough already, let's see some shots. - Please, God, let these shots be okay. - Well? How do they look? - [Sophie] Ah, I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened. - I do, you fucked up. - J, I never fuck up. I am a professional photographer. I graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design, RISD. This must have been a mechanical failure of some sort. What about X-rays? - What? - That's the only reason I can think of why these shots did not turn out. Someone is beaming X-rays into our studio. Those god damn X-rays are going to be the death of my company. Now listen, J, I want you to get me some estimates on lead lining this place. And, while you're at it, get someone in here with a Geiger counter to check for stray radiation. - George, you want a squid ring with gravy sauce? - Mr. Peepers, there are alternatives to those squid rings of yours. Well, take my sandwich, for instance. Organic vegetables grown by independent subsistence farmers who are not destroying our rainforests. - Oh, George, stop already with your eco speak. You wanna know something. There really is no substitute for a delicious squid ring. Very yummy. - Mr. Peepers, you're terrible. Absolutely terrible. Why, I've been boycotting your squid restaurant chain for two years now. That company is destroying our mother earth and they don't even earmark any of their profits for community service. - George, I'm gonna split, I'll see you later. (magical music) (jingling) - Oh, hello, how can I help you? I'm George. - Oh, hello, George, I'm Sabrina. Sabrina Mayflower. I hope I'm in the right place. I'm looking for a new pet doggy. Bow wow. - Um, yes, Sabrina, you've come to the right place but I'm gonna have to ask you to extinguish that cigarette. This is a no smoking doggy zone. - Oh, why, of course, darling. There. Now, can you help me find a new pet doggy. - Uh, yes, Sabrina, you've come to the right place if you're looking to adopt a pup. - Fabulous, fabulous. Do you carry rottweilers? Those dogs are so sexy. Or, maybe an Afghan, you know, something trendy and glamorous. I've tried all the pet shops in the area, George. But, I'm glad I came here. It's so funky and I do love funky things. - Uh, well. - Oh, do you like it? There's nothing like the real thing. - The real thing? - Why, of course, darling, I wouldn't be caught dead in one of those imitation minks. Imitation is so tacky and classless. But, a real fur makes me feel like the real woman that I am. - Ms. Mayflower, I find your coat to be absolutely repulsive. Real fur is for real fools. Are you happy that some helpless animals were killed in order to adorn your body? And then, you have the nerve to come into my office in order to adopt a pup? Lady, I am in the business of trying to save animal lives while you clearly are more interested in destroying our furry friends in order to accessorize yourself. I'm sorry if I'm being rude but I'm going to have to ask you to leave at once. - My God, you're one of those pathetic animal rights freaks. - Yes, I am. Now, get out of here, get out, you bitch. (beatboxing) (knocking) - Number one. Number one. The fuck you want? - Room service. - Maria Sopapia, what's up, what's up? What do you got for me? - It's your meal, Mr. George. Compliments of the management. - Well, I hope dessert is included. - I don't know, let me check. - 'Cause I would love a piece of pie or maybe a little cherry in my mouth. Or fuck your pussy with my tongue. Fuck your pussy with my tongue. Pussy with my tongue. Fuck with your pussy with my. Uh, I'll pay you $500. - How 'bout a thousand? - You drive a hard bargain, girlie. - It will be worth it, Mr. George. (beatboxing) - My dismal life has no meaning. Soon I will end this wretched existence and shrug off the mortal coil. Misery is my sole companion. So, let the curtains fall where they may. Well, Coach, how was that? - Try it again, Sophie, but this time try to really connect with your character's personal torment and inner demons. - Okay, here we go. My dismal life has no meaning. Soon I will end this wretched existence and shrug off the mortal coil. Misery is my sole companion. So, let the curtains fall where they may. - Stop! What are you doing? - I'm acting. - But, why must you speak in such a monotone? - I don't speak in a monotone. - Yes, you do. - Well, you're the professional actor. Whatever you say must be right. - Let's just try it again and this time slow down and concentrate on your breathing. - What about the method? Can you teach me the method? - You are not ready for the method. - Okay, let me try again. Oh, hey Coach, how's my presence? - Your presence is fine. Just try it again. - Okay. My dismal life has no meaning. Soon I will end this wretched existence and shrug off the mortal coil. Soon I will end this wretched existence and shrug off the mortal coil. Misery is my sole companion. So, let the curtains fall where they may. - That was fine, Sophie, just fine. But, let's wrap it up for today, shall we? And, I'll see you tomorrow. But, please, please try to remember what we went over today. And, I have some reading for you. - Thanks, Coach. You know something, Coach. On that last try, I really felt something. I was focused. I was free. You know something, I think I'm getting the hang of this acting thing. Bye, Coach. - Jody, look at this headline. This paper is on every newstand in town. - It's a fucking French newspaper. Who the fuck, hey, you wanna know something. You wanna know something fucking important? - What? - I just got myself fucking importantly laid by a fucking sweet fucking hottie. - Yippie. Jody, read the headline. - Jody George is god. That's not a fucking bet, what. - It says Jody George is gay. (exploding) - How the fuck can anyone think that Jody George is gay? Look at me, Jody George is not gay. Alright, alright, alright. This is what you're gonna do. You're gonna call my publicist and you get this fucking piece of shit, - No. frog ass headline changed. - No, it's too late. - What the fuck do you mean it's too late. Jody George is not gay. That's a lie, change the headline. What the fuck else does this newspaper say? - Well. - Oh no, no, what, come on. Read it, read it, read it, read it. Jody George, let me guess. Jody George fucks his mom. Jody George screws his pooch. Shit. - Can I finish? Well, it says that you were spotted at a gay bar with Pierre Le Chapeau and that you two were seen holding hands sipping champagne from the same glass and kissing. - Pierre Le Chapeau? - Yeah. Pierre Le Chapeau? - Yeah. The guys a fucking second rate hack. I beat him six one, six one, - Yeah, I know. six four in that stupid - I know. ass Monte Carlo Tournament. - I know. I didn't even want to go to. That bastard hasn't even fucking cracked the top 20. - Well, that may not be but this paper says that he is openly gay. - What the fuck, who cares. I beat him in under 70 minutes. Alright, alright, alright, alright. I beat him and maybe I took him out for a couple of fucking drinks. How am I supposed to know he's gay? - Well, apparently, there were quite a few witnesses to your little date including a bartender and a couple of off-duty cops who said that you and Pierre Le Chapeau were carrying on like a couple of lovebirds. - The fuck is going on? What the fuck is going on? - Calm down. I will take care of everything. - It's not fair. You know what I'm saying? It's just not fair. I've worked my whole life to be number one and now everyone wants to write that Jody George is some kind of fucking fruit bat. Well, I'm number one. That's what they should write about. Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on a second now. Listen to me. Jody George wants you to know something alright. Jody George is not a homosexual. Comprende? - Yes, Jody. Alright, 'cause Jody George likes pussy. Alright, Jody George likes fucking pussy. Grab it, flip it, rub it down and all. - Word, yeah, I understand. I understand. - Good. Then you fucking take care of this shit and clear my name. My family finds out, they'll shit. So, work it. - Where are my tax accountants? Greenberg and Greenberg. The best that money can buy. Where are they? I hate this time of year. (buzzing) J, see who that is. It had better be Greenberg and Greenberg. Damn it, I thought it was my tax guys. Hey, I didn't order any Chinese take out today. You boys must have the wrong address. - [J] Sophie, this is Greenberg and Greenberg. - Hi, I'm Greenberg and this is Greenberg. - Oops. - George, relax, you did the right thing. - Oh, I don't know, Mr. Peepers. I feel like such a meanie. I had no right to speak to that woman like that. - George, you are suffering from an unhealthy case of liberal guilt. - What do you mean? - You know, liberal guilt. The plague that's ravishing our population. It's reducing us to a pack of spineless, whimpering fools. Enough with your guilt ridden blubbering. That stupid lady was getting on your nerves and so you called her a bitch and you kicked her out. - But, I could've been more tactful. - Fuck tact. - My my, Mr. Peepers, such language. - Here, George, have a drink. - Mr. Peepers, what have I told you about drinking at the workplace? It's against the rules. - Whoops, George, how right you are. So sorry, so sorry. (magical music) - Uh, Ms. Sophie, what should we put down your occupation as? - Oh, well, Greenberg number one. I am, first and foremost, a video artist. And, a fashion designer. And, a painter. Oh, actress. Photographer. Producer. Art director. Oh, image consultant. Hey, J, did I leave anything out? - No, Sophie, I think that about covers it. - Oh, shut up, J. He's just jealous of my raw talent. Just ignore him. Oh, oh, put down that I'm also a playwright. And, a performance artist. And, a -- - How the fuck could anyone think that Jody George is a homosexual? Alright, alright. Jody George is not a homosexual. And, it's not fucking fair because you know I worked all my life. I worked all my life to become number one. And, now that I am number one, all they wanna say is Jody George is a freaking flamer. And, I swear to God, I catch that mother fucker who told that fucking lie, I'll fucking lop off his mother fucking balls. (ringing) No one fucking calls, screening mother fucking cheap ass. (ringing) Hello. - [Man On Phone] Hello, this is Jody George? - Yeah, this is Jody George. - Jody, my boy, this is Harrison. Harrison Sterling. - Hey, Harrison, what's up? - [Harrison] Well.

You know with my number one ranking you can go sell a shit load of shoes. More than you've ever sold before. - Jody, what's all this fag business? - Look, it's some French gossip newspaper thing, okay. It's nothing to get bent out of shape about. - Jody, are you gay? - Hey, hey, hey, hold on, hold on here. Alright, listen. Jody George is not a homosexual. I don't know what happened but this whole thing is gonna blow over. - Well, for your sake, let's hope it does. Let's hope it does. We're going to lose a lot of business if the public thinks that you're a fag. And, they're not going to buy Riva Shoes if they think you're some kind of god damn flaming queen. - Listen to me, alright, please, Harrison. Jody George is not a queer. I don't know what happened with the press, okay. I don't know. I'm not a scientist. - If this situation isn't resolved soon, you're going to find your ass floating in space with no sponsorship whatsoever. - Oh, Harrison, please relax. Everything is gonna be under control. - It had better be, Jody. I'll be in touch. - Yeah. (dialtone ringing) Hello? - [Sophie] What are you talking about, Greenberg and Greenberg? How can you charge me $7,000 for my lousy tax preparation? - [Greenberg #1] Well, Ms. Sophie, there was a lot of paperwork because of your 27 different occupations. - So, that's the price I have to pay for being a renaissance woman. So, I owe you boys $7,000. - [Both Greenbergs] Yes. - Will you take a check? - [Both Greenbergs] Yes. - Okay, you'll get your money. Would you like some? Well, let's make it $6,000 that I owe you and then I'll get you stoned. - [Both Greenbergs] Okay. - Have you ever tried this stuff? - I had some once at my cousin, Morty's, barmitzvah.

He really should be more careful about where he deposits his mess. Oh my gosh. This is not a very pleasant situation. Feces everywhere, feces everywhere. (magical music) - Having fun, George? - Now, look here, Mr. Peepers. I'm upset with you. Will you look at this mess on my desk. What has gotten into you? - Look at me, George. I'm a dog. Shit happens. - Well, next time, use your litter box or go outside. - George, your phone is ringing. (ringing) - Hello, Urban Dog Placement Center, this is George speaking. How can I help you? - [Woman On Phone] George? - Mom? (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - [Mom] Now, why did I call you, anyway? Oh yes, I wanted to invite you for dinner tonight. You aren't doing anything, are you? We miss you here so much, right Hugo? (barking) - Oh, mom. - [Mom] I'm making your favorite. Meatloaf with brown gravy and those little candied carrots. They cost an arm and a leg. Not in season, not in season those carrots. But, like the Reader's Digest says, you have to treat yourself every once in a while. - Mom, you know I don't eat meat. I haven't eaten meat in three years. - [Mom] Oh, that's right. You're a vegetarius. - Vegetarian. - [Mom] Vegetarian. - Listen, Mom. I really should be going. There's been an emergency here. - [Mom] George, I really worry about you sitting alone all day in that dog office. And, you're probably overworked, right? - Uh. Oh, you know, it's not as bad as you think, Mom. I actually sort of enjoy being here all by myself. - [Mom] I just worry, George. And, it ain't good for a human to be all alone for so many hours. It doesn't sound natural. It just doesn't sound natural at all. - Oh. Don't worry about me, Mom. (panting) - You fucking looking at my ass? You're fucking, you're fucking sorry. You're fucking looking at my ass. Oh yeah. Yeah, you're fucking sorry. Fucking sorry. Fucking, fucking. Fucking, fucking. Fucking asshole looking at my fucking. Fuck. Bitch. Go fuck you. Think I'm a fucking queer. Fuck. I'm fucking number one in this fucking world. And, you're a fucking fag. And, my fucking dick fucking every pussy. I like big pussy. I like big pussy. I like big fucking pussy. And, I'm a fucking mother fucking good person. So, fuck you. Fuck you, fuck you. - Well, J, I'm glad my damn taxes are done. Have you called the modeling agency? - Yes, I have, Sophie, and the girls should be arriving here in 15 minutes. - Now, when the model pussy gets here, I want you to be very professional. We'll have a little time to weed out the ugly ones and then we've got to get the video shoot underway. I also want you to make sure the camera crew is on location and ready to go. - I've already taken care of that. - And, listen, J, I don't want any fuck ups. This is my first music video and I wanna make sure that everything goes smoothly. Got it? - Yes, Sophie. - If we do a good job today, we're going to be on Easy Street. Okay, any questions? - Yeah, just one. What band was this video for? - Oh, it's um. God damn it, it's something like. You know something, J. That's a really stupid question. What's important is that we get these models to shake their tits and buns for us. Let's not forget our priorities, J. Priorities are what separate us from the savages. - Yes, Sophie. - I must work. I must remain focused for the video shoot. I must not get distracted. (whooshing) (funky music) (car alarm blaring) Damn it, I must work. I must remain focused for the video shoot. I must not get distracted. ♫ Homosexual we love you ♫ Homosexual things you do ♫ Homosexual kill Dan White ♫ Homosexual what's it like ♫ Don't like boys you like girls ♫ Living in your faggot world ♫ Talking sex with lawyer's wives ♫ Sneaking out to meet the guys ♫ Homosexual I'm ashamed ♫ Homosexual that's your name ♫ Homosexual where's the blame ♫ Homosexual I can't explain. ♫ Homosexual we love you - [Manager] Well, it looks like the shit has really hit the fan. - Yeah, yeah, it really does.

Here take two. - Give me two. Cheer up, Jody George. You're number one in the world. - Hello, girls, hello. Just make yourselves comfortable. My name is Sophie and this is my assistant, J. I have a few more things to take care of so please be patient. Will you look at them, J. I've never seen an uglier bunch of cows. - Don't worry, they're going to look hideous until we get them into hair and makeup. - Look at the thighs on that one. Talk about cottage cheese on a drumstick. I've never seen so much cellulite in my life. - They're not that bad. Come on, let's just get to work. - What do you mean, look at the face on that one. Broken capillaries, enlarged pores, wrinkles, blackheads and ingrown hairs. I've seen salad bars that look better than that girl. And, look at that other girl over there. Ms. Mustache, if she had anymore of an underbite we could use her as an ashtray. My God, are we looking at models now or is this the casting call for Auschwitz My Years in Hell. - Look, Sophie, it's too late to get new model pussy from the agency. I think we should just go ahead, shoot the video with the girls we have. They really do look fine to me. - Oh my God, J, who asked you? Why aren't there any darker ones? You know, some flavor. There's no flavor in this room. We don't even have an Oriental girl. I thought I requested some color. Where's the color? Where's the flavor? Damn that agency, this will not do. This will not do. How can I make my music video with this room full of rejects? I'm an artist, God damn it, not a plastic surgeon. Get me the agency on the phone. J, get me the agency on the phone. (coughing) And, J. What about that bottle of lung pills. Have you found me that bottle of lung pills, yet? (coughing) - Urban Dog Placement Center, this is George speaking. Um, you're with what office? - The City Personnel Office, you know, hirings, firings, promotions, raises, retirements. Anyway, we understand you've been severely understaffed and we apologize for the delay. The good news is that your request has gone through. - What are you talking about? - You're request for a full-time office assistant has been approved. - A full-time office assistant? - That's right. All of your forms and paperwork seem to be in order. You can expect your new assistant to arrive on Monday morning at 8AM sharp. - But, I really think I've got things under control here. - You'll finally get that office help that you need. Sheesh, if they had me working seven months all by myself, I would've quit. - You know, it really isn't so bad, I think-- - I just wouldn't have been able to handle it. I just have to be around people. George, I just wanted to call and give you the good news. - Okay. Thanks. Bye. (barking) - Hello, Zeitgeist management. I'd like to talk to Chenille, this is Sophie. Hello, Chenille, darling, how are you? Good, well listen. Those models you sent over will not do. They're all so hideous. I thought I was getting your best girls. You sent me a bunch of oily-faced, cellulite-ridden, zitty hos. I can't make my music video with the girls you sent over, Chenille. And, what about the flavor? I need some black ones, I need some Orientals, something ethnic. All you sent me was milquetoast, god damn it. Milquetoast. No, you relax, Chenille. You call your business a modeling agency, 4H Club is more like it. I'm sending the god damn cows home. Moo. J, I want you to send the model pussy home. - Now, what about the video? - Now, stop with your stupid questions. Just do what I say, send the girls home, chop chop. - What do I tell them? - Are you a moron, J? Tell them the truth. Tell them they look fat. Tell them they look hideous. Tell them they aren't getting paid. Now, get rid of them. They're making my eyeballs bleed. Chop chop. (defeated music) (water running) (coughing) (ringing) - Hello. - Jody, it's me. Yeah, what's up? - Well, things have gone from bad to worse. Some of your clothing sponsors have cancelled their contracts. The rest are monitoring events and preparing to act. - What about Harrison and the shoe contract? (buzzing) - I'm afraid it's a little late for that, Jody. They're sending their lawyers over tonight. I have a feeling they're going to cancel their contract and terminate the deal to save face. - Okay, Mike, we'll see ya. - [Woman On TV] No, no, no, no. Wait just a minute. - [Man On TV] Now, that's what happens here. - [Woman On TV] Excuse me. (laughing) - [Man On TV] Dude, I sure won't be communicating with... (barking) - Mail call, George, my boy. - Uh, thank you, Mr. Peepers. Mr. Peepers, there's something I'd like to discuss with you. - What is it, George, my boy. - Well, uh, Mr. Peepers, I just got a phone call a little while ago. It was the City Personnel Office. And, well, they've assigned, uh, me a new assistant. So, starting Monday, there will be someone else in this office besides us and, um, what I'm trying to say is that, um, this is a small office and, um, well, you know, there will be another person in here besides us on Monday and, um, well, what I'm saying is that, um, that it was fine here with just you and me. But, that, um, with another person moving in here that, um, maybe this office might just be a bit too crowded for three. - So, that's the way you feel, George? - Come on, Mr. Peepers, you're taking this the wrong way. We can still get together for lunch, for coffee breaks. - You know something, George. You're right, it's just gonna be too crowded. (magical music) (whinning) (buzzing) (crackling) - [Woman On Radio] Including rings. (speaking foreign language) (blow dryer running) (electrocuting) (yelling) (somber music) - I can't believe what a disaster that music video shoot turned into. And, all because of that dumb modeling agency that sent me those ugly heffers. - Sophie, what are you going to tell the record company? You've already spent the entire budget for the music video and you have nothing to show for it. - I don't know what I'm going to tell them. Hey, J, did you see the way those people back there were staring at me? - What people? - That crowd, don't turn around. I think they're still staring. J, I'm being recognized in public. - No, you aren't, Sophie, get real. - No, no, those people know who I am. I can sense these things. Do you have a pen on you? - What are you talking about? - You know, J, a pen. We have to be ready if they want my autograph. Now, where are my eight by ten headshots? I hope I brought them. - Electric bill. Phone bill. Rent. Doggy pharmaceuticals. Attention, George, you could be our next $7,000,000 winner. (tearing) (barking) Dear Mr. George. I wanted to write you this letter to tell you how happy I am with my new best friend, Peaches. I love him so much and we have so much fun together. I don't have many friends. But with Peaches, I have a brand new best friend. Thank you for helping me to choose Peaches. He's perfect for me and I think he's the best pet in the world. Love Amelia. Thank you, Amelia. Thank you. Now, George. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself. It is National Beagle Week. And, you've got some fine pups to find homes for. So, times a wasting. Let's get to work. Okay. - Jody, it's Maria. I'm here with more dessert. (screaming) (glass breaking) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) - I think they're still staring at me, J. - Get real, Sophie, nobody's staring at you. - Shut up, J. You're just jealous because they don't recognize you. - Sophie, when are you going to snap out of it. You are a nothing. The world doesn't know who you are and also doesn't care who you are. You are a nothing and a nobody. - J, how dare you talk to me like that. - You know what, Sophie, you are the ultimate nothing. - Shut up, J. - And, I've had it with your pathetic enterprise. I can't believe that I've stayed with you this long. You can take your $20 an hour job and shove it up your puckered ass. As of this moment, I am no longer your assistant. I quit. - J, You can't quit. - Oh, yes I can, Sophie, oh, yes I can. - Please, J, come back. Come on, J. Please come back. J.
