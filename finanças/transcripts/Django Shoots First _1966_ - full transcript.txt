Hello! You're the first human face I've seen in three days. Trust my friend here won't disturb your dinner. All the same, unlike me. he ain't got much appetite. Thanks. If you're heading towards Silver Creek, stop at the saloon. Whenever I collect a bounty. I buy drinks for everybody. - How much will you get for him? - Plenty. $5,000 according to the bank posters. $5,000. Due and payable to me at the bank of Silver Creek. $5,000! He was important, Thomas Gavin. You know who he is? He was my father. You just wait now! I only aim to bring in your dad. I don't want to kill the whole family. Unless you got a price on your head, I'm not interested. Don't try swapping lead with me. cos bounty killing is my business. Now, you mount that horse and go. There isn't a living soul who knows old Garvin had a son. Take some friendly advice and move on to some other place! Don't force me to do something that I'll- I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner, Dad. Well, that's done. Soon as I've finished. you'll rest real easy. Ain't very pleasant work in this heat. As long as I can recall. Dad, you never worked up a good sweat. Know something? I never understood how you made a living. We never saw much of each other, I guess. That day when you walked out of the house to buy some tobacco. I guess I didn't see you in three years. And after Mum died I had to learn to shift for myself. If I hadn't seen that poster in Silver Creek. I wouldn't have known if you were dead or alive. New, Dad, do you think that's nice? To leave your sen for so many years? Besides, most fathers leave something to their sons when they pass on. But not you, you went and gave that jackal $5,000. And not a cent to me! $5,000, Well, he can't collect it now. No, sir, Nobody will, I reckon. $5,000, well, I guess someone will be glad. That sure is a lot of money. $5,000.., I have never seen that much. Listen, Dad, I was just thinking you wouldn't want to be buried here. It's nothing but rubbish and jack rabbits. No trees and nobody rides by here. Wouldn't it be much better to be buried in town? Where there's trees and shade on a nice gravestone? Because I was thinking that it'd be a real shame to let that reward go to waste. And besides wouldn't we be better off if I covered him up instead of you? I know that you'd like it that way. An idea, right? DJANGO SHOOTS FIRST It's been a mighty short time since he escaped and you got him. I'll be hanged if I can't figure out why Thomas Garvin broke jail. Why, two years and he wouldn't have been out. You have to give him a nice funeral. Sure.., And who'll pay? We will, I'll pay you the money, and you can take care of it. All I want is a big headstone. With his picture. I promised it to him. - Gordon, are you making a deposit? - You know not to ask me that! Then why are you always coming in here? It's because I like to smell it. Morning, Mr Cooper. This fella has come to collect the reward for Thomas Garvin. Well, $5,000 is a lot of money. I supposed you earned it, young fellow. Here, You have to sign the receipt. You too, Sheriff, since you identified the body. Glenn Garvin. Why you carry the last name of Thomas Garvin? Because I'm his son. He's your father. But he said his son was called Django! That's right, they call me like that in Mexico. Excuse me, gents. I'll be back in a minute. Come in. There's a fellow outside with the sheriff who's come to collect his reward on Thomas Garvin. Well? It's mighty odd, sir, He says he's Garvin's son. He's what? That's right, sir, Glenn Garvin. I see. You killed your own father to collect the reward. Oh, no, sir, It's not like that. I'll just bring in his body, that's all. And I'm sure my father wouldn't object to me doing it. I've been told there was a bounty killer trailing your father. Did you run across him? That's right! I sure did! Well, you see, he and I had a difference of opinion. Then what proof do we have that the bounty killer there belongs to you? Who brings in the body gets the reward. You'll have your reward, so get out. I'll give you five minutes to get out of my bank and leave town. Here you are, You mind signing this as a witness? For his funeral, All of it. - Good morning. - Mrs Kluster. - Good morning. - Good morning. Is anything wrong? No, Jessica, Business. Come in. She's funny, she's my type. - Who is she? - A lady. That's Mrs Kluster. You are not fit for someone like that. Well, Sheriff, sorry. but I have to go. Now, don't be worrying about that. cos nobody here will be missing you. You looking for me? Look up there! You've killed one too many this time. I'm sorry, but you're wrong! The other fella shot at him first, I saw it all! All right, Gordon! I'm going to bring him in. But the boy was attacked first. This dead fella was aiming at him from up on the roof. His Winchester was pointed right at him. I was the one who saw him and warned him. There, you see? Thought you said you was fixing to leave town? Don't worry, I'll leave. This is the last place on Earth I'd want to be caught dead in. Thanks. You don't mean to let them run off? And who'd you be? You're looking at the one who's going to bring you luck! You? Why? You better listen to what I'm about to tell you. Because half of what you see around here belongs to you. The saloon, the hotel. the bank, All that's yours! Half the bank? Certainly! Because you own exactly 50% of it! That's why Kluster's all fired out to get you out of town. But I don't think you're the kind that scares easy, are you? Now, come with me! From now on, we're friends! This time Miss Lucy won't have any excuses to not let me in. Come on! Hello, gorgeous. - Two whiskeys! - Get your money out first! You know if you don't pay for your drinks in advance, I can't serve you. But this is a mighty special occasion. For, you see, my dear. My Mend over here is this bark, new owner. All of which means that you'd better watch it! - I see, And since when? - He's always been the proprietor. You'd be looking at Glenn Garvin! The son of Thomas Garvin! You sure you're the son of Thomas? Yeah, from what my mum told me, I sure am. Oh, I've heard lots of things concerning your father. Yeah, So have I. Don't you pay it no wind! I know all about it. A few years ago. your father came here. He teamed up with Kluster, the banker. And bought this saloon. They were in partnership. And your father. Thomas, had 50% of it all. But one day there was trouble. Something about smuggling guns, I think. Thomas went to jail. Kluster went soot-free. You know why he wants you out of town! Yeah, of course. But their company still exists, Only you'll take your fathers place! My dad's place? Now. come on! That's too much! I say it's your rightful duty, boy! It's about time somebody denied him in! I want you to kill him quickly. And I suggest you be careful on how you do it. You'll find him at the saloon. You better get on with it, Ward. Don't you worry, I know how to take care of him. The Foster brothers tried without success when you were down in Warren. Those boys ain't much good without me. Ward... Don't try to be a hero and go alone. I've seen him fight. so you just watch out. I know my business, lady. That Kluster is one of the worst skunks we've ever had around here. He must hold mortgages on every ranch and little farms in the county. And he's quick to foreclose, all right! Well, he'll just have to watch out. Because my friend over here will know just what to do. I hope so, Django. I'd be really pleased to have you here as boss of this saloon. But take my advice, Better leave this town while you can. That Kluster will never give you half of what he owns. And besides that, why should he? He'll just have one of his gangs kill you! Watch out! Evening. My boys want something to drink. Well, let's see how you all did for today. Not much? If you don't do better. I'll have Kluster throw you and your brother right out of here. That is, of course, If you and me reach an- Ward, you leave my sister alone! - When I get... - Leave that money there, Ward. I was told that you were acting like you were the owner here. Of 50% that is, yes. Hear that, boys? Seems there's a new owner here. Now just fancy that! I guess now before we drink. We'll have to ask for your permission. Seeing as you're the new partner... ...you're entitled to half the take. Why don't you pick it up, then? This here is 50% for Kluster. This half is mine. All right, boys, Let's get along, Sure no sense... Get out! Now, you go to your boss. And tell him that tomorrow morning I'm going to be there to make our accounts, got it? My compliments to you! You made this day memorable! I'll offer the drinks to honor the occasion! He and I are going to do great things! You two will be getting yourselves killed! Hold on. I want to thank you. New, What's, he got? He appears wrong in the head. All that learning will do that. Dad... I didn't think that you were a man of property. Sorry, Dad, I underestimated you. You'd better let me take care of that cheek, Let's go to your room. Listen, Gordon. Is it true that when someone is as good with a pistol as Django. All the gunslingers come to challenge him? That's right. That fella who had that black cane, Is he one? Never seen him before. I don't know what to say. This is the best room in the place that we have, Mr Django. I hope the new owner will like it and be comfortable. It must bother you to have a new owner around. No, I don't think so, Thought it might. I mean, if it causes fighting. which you're good at... ...my brother and I have mind to move on. Why? I thought you liked me. - And why ask me that? - Well, I... I just hope so. Listen, Django. Let's get this straight. As long as you're around these parts, you better keep away from my sister. And don't suppose you can scare me, cos you beat up Ward. - Oh, no, Billy, That's all. - I won't warn you again. It's late, Lucy, and you... Good night, Django. They're all now working for Kluster, Trying to scare you. Sure is enough of them. Don't worry. You take care of the ones on the right side of the street. And I'll watch the ones on the left. All right. They're all coming to me! That's right, They must know you're the most dangerous one. Now, what did I tell you? You and me out bluffed them! I hope so! - Can you write? - Well, yes, certainly. All right, then take a brush and paint a sign out there right in front of the door. "Garvin and Kluster: Partners." - But I'm afraid... There will be no buts about it! You realize I'm the owner of this place? Unless you start doing things my way. That weekly wage you're earning won't be much. Come in, Please come in. - Have you met? - Yes, I saw her yesterday. Yes.., We've been expecting you. Well, it seems like a cold reception for the son of an old friend. And just what was it you expected to find? Well, let me see, A fancy desk like this, for example. And with a nice bunch of flowers, say. With your card reading. "Welcome home, partner." Well, you see, boy. I don't think things here are exactly the way you figured. Now, I'll explain. You know our father and I had a small partnership. And I'm prepared to give you his part of it. It comes to almost $10000. and that's a generous estimate. From your point of view, I'm sure it is. But that's all you have a right to be paid, The rest is mine! I created it all with years of hard work! And that would be during the time my father was in jail. There was another little difference. His cell there wasn't decked out as well as yours is. My clad didn't have the comforts a lady like this could afford him. Your father was an unfortunate fellow. What are you trying to prove? I don't need to prove anything. I want my 50%, Mr Kluster. Tomorrow I'll be back, I want to find everything accounted for. Half of everything. Remember, the bank. the saloon and the ranch. Oh, I don't expect you to include the lady. Naturally. He certainly isn't wanting in courage. All young fools can have that, but they're brainless. And the ones with brains win out in life. I just saw that Garvin kid. Yes, he's been paying us a call. Hey! How did it go? Well, just fine, I'll see you later? - I'll come along! - No, not this time! This is a fine state of affairs! Rich as we are, and we've only one horse! - What do you mean "rich as we are"? - What? You and I, right? I give you my word. Next time I'll shoot him before we can make a move. You'd better, or else you'll end up worse than you did yesterday when you and your friends were so roundly beaten up. Well, you see, ma'am. we didn't know him then. Oh, I thought I told you. Garvin has only won the first round, Wait till we fight. I suggest you get started. You know that I want that Garvin boy killed. Mr Kluster, I want him dead more than you do. And I aim to do it myself tonight. If you can do that... that's for the best. Hello! Oh, thank you! Actually, I picked them for my dad's grave. I guess you've been looking over the ranch and the house. No, only from the outside, I just arrived. You may visit the hacienda whenever you like. As you know, you own 50%, You must pick out the part you want. Well, I guess I'll just do that. Yes, half the part where you live will be just fine for me. It's the most beautiful part of the house, and it's on the south side. I told you, you could have a choice. And so can I. I have every intention of being on the side that wins. Here it is. Not a bad place? A little sun, though. I brought you some flowers, too. They're right from our ranch. I'm getting a tree and I'm going to get you the biggest tomb in town! With a marble bust! No, Dad! You don't say anything! All right, I know you liked to save money. But a man like you has a position to keep up. You see, I sure am proud that it was my old man that built up this whole town. Frankly, I never would have believed it. And now I'm bound to follow you. All right, Django! Stay where you are! You picked the right place to die! Excuse me, Dad, but I won't join you just yet! Bye! No. You're trapped this time, Django! We'll close in on you when it's dark! He is not here, I looked all over, No one knows where he is. Somewhere fooling around! When he has to deal with Kluster tomorrow. He clears that mind of his by being out all night! Just when he needs plenty of rest! It may not be his fault, Gordon. but you wouldn't think of that! You needn't have mentioned it! That causes bad luck! Good evening. I would like to have my dinner now. He's dead, He got him with a knife. Who did this to you? Ward.., And four other men. But you got them all, didn't you? No, not all of them, I'm sorry, Next time I will. And Ward? He's the one that got away. Here, let me do that. I was a practicing physician. Nothing serious. Merely a scratch. Are you still planning to go and talk to Kluster tomorrow? I have to do it, Lucy. Not if you'd take my advice, you wouldn't. It's simply foolish. since you're all alone. Alone, and, what's more, with a wounded leg. Who's all alone? I'm here! Two obstacles your imagination exaggerates, Miss Lucy. Tomorrow, I predict his leg won't bother him. And tomorrow they're not going alone to see Mr Kluster. I intend to go along with them. Thanks, That's mighty nice, I'm sure we'll need help. I promise when I get my hands on my money, I'll- That doesn't interest me in the least. What's he got? He sure beats me. Just one of those studious kinds, Like I told you! Listen, Gordon, as far as Kluster's concerned, you know I have to go to him for what he did to my father. But you don't. Think it over. You know, to a man like him. Your life is worth no more than mine. That's all right! I don't care much! My interest isn't the money either. I'll risk it tomorrow. You're the performing kind. Why I'd walk a long way to see your act. My great weakness in life is for a gunslinger who is a concert artist. Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. There's one more, sir. Sheriff! Sheriff! - What is it? - I've just had a robbery! He killed poor old Cooper, and he made off with the whole lot. Recognize the man? Well, his face was covered up. But I could swear that it was Django, the son of Thomas Garvin. Well, now, that's a mighty serious charge. What kind of proof you got? Is Django still upstairs? We'll be late to meet Kluster! Oh, finally! You keep your men in order. He's got to be arrested and tried, I don't want no lynching'! Don't worry, Sheriff, We intend to abide by the law. Come out of there, Django! You didn't tell me there was a reception in your honor this morning! - What kind of reception? - One of the uplifting kind. Well, look at that! Your partners idea. Django! Come out with your hands in the air! You'll be given a fair trial, I'll guarantee it! Thanks for the guarantee, Sheriff. But I'd like to know why you want to bother giving me a fair trial. The bank was robbed last night. This knife's yours. and it killed the cashier. If I don't see you walk through that door in one minute. I'll come in and get you! We can testify that you were with us. No, Remember the four I got? I used the knife on one of them. And why not explain that to the sheriff? Because the sheriff needs evidence. But if we go out together. we may convince him better. All right, Django! That's enough! I'll come, Sheriff. Stop shooting! Django, down here! Get out of my way, you! Hold on, gents! Let us through! Get back in there! - Make up your mind, Sheriff! - To hell with you! - Where did he go? - I don't know! Search upstairs! Sheriff, there isn't anyone up here. Then he must have used a window, Look for him outside! There he is! He's getting away! After him! Mount up! Quickly! Quickly! Quickly! Let's go. He's heading to the hill. Looks like Kluster's turned this whole town against the youngster! His trail ends here. That's mighty strange. You all take a look around! Mrs Kluster? Mrs Kluster? Sorry, Mrs Kluster! That Django has robbed your husband's bank! And this is where we trailed him. You mean in my bathroom? Yes, ma'am, No, ma'am, it's- Do you think I'm hiding him? Get out! Yes, Yes, ma'am. On your horses, boys! He didn't go to the hills. Let's go back, Come on! Thanks, Thanks for the hospitality. Tell me, why did you hide me. If you're always on the winners side? Because when you know Kluster, you get rather bored of him. Why, for me it's just been the opposite. Ever since I met him, I haven't had a moment in which to get bored. I'm always being shot at when my back is turned. Wouldn't it be nice to go and see other places? Far away. Why don't you, then? I'm ready to do just that when you are, too. You know, going traveling takes a lot of money. They robbed my bank this morning. Now, I'm sure that robber worked for Kluster. I think you'll get it all again. Kluster wants you to wait for him here. He wants us to wait for him, too. Where do you want us to go? Stay over there by the mine entrance. Sure. I'll get rid of the son the same way as I did his father. I had offered him $10000. But now it'll only cost me five for his reward. The same as Thomas Garvin's. So, you see I'm saving money. I hope so, That seems to be your standard price for the Garvin family. Hey, not so tight! That fool boy fell right into the trap. It was more difficult to convince Tom Garvin to break out of jail. Seemed as if he suspected it. If that stupid bounty killer, Ringo. hadn't gotten himself killed. We wouldn't have had all this trouble. Well, thanks, That'll be all right now. It was a tiring day. but worthwhile. You'd better get some sleep. I think you'd better take some of this. And it's good for your nerves. Drink up. Is the money hidden in a safe place? Of course, I gave it to Ward. He's waiting for my orders at the old mine. Well, get some sleep, Good night. The money's been given to Ward. He's waiting at the old mine now. Kluster is sound asleep. so you can kill him. Then we can go away together with the money. No, Not yet. I want to prove I'm not a robber or a murderer. I thought you wanted to kill Kluster and leave this place. You're right. But it's a question of how. I'd be running away all my life. Hounded by sheriffs and bounty killers. I'll go with clean hands and my own money. For that I'll need my friends. And you're the one who's going to take me to them. - Am I? - You are. If you want part of the money. We won't have any news of Django this evening. Therefore I'm going to go to bed. Well, no news is good news. I have a hunch he'll show up. Django! Now we know where you've been and we've been worried about you! Lucy, hush! You know Miss Lucy? I've seen her, Though I wouldn't want to know a Wench socially. You won't call me like that! Hold on! Simmer down! Seems to me you had that coming to you, ma'am. Oh, let me.., Let me go! It was Kluster who took the money. but I know where it is, Where's Doc? He's upstairs. She's broken up with Kluster, and wants to help us. Beware of that woman! First she deceived me, Then it was Kluster. Now, you're next. I followed her here to kill her. But when I found her, I couldn't do it. Jessica's my wife. What are we waiting for? Let's follow her. She'll be going to Ward. unless we get there first. No! Not out of the front door, They might see you. This way! Let's go! Garvin and his friends will be here any minute now. And Kluster? Where's he? He didn't want to be involved in the robbery. He wants you to take me to Matamoros, and he'll join us there. He said for you to leave all the cash in the bank there in my name. All right! We're going to Mexico! Mount up! Their tracks lead that way to Mexico! Let's go. To the rocks! I lost track of them near the Rio Grande. And we can't follow them into Mexico. Well, I can, Sheriff, and I intend to get my money back. Besides that, Mrs Kluster is missing from the ranch. This is for you. Ward was trying to take the money into Mexico. We found her going with him. You liar! You're the thief! He was the one who planned it all to be rid of Django! He's accusing me to save his life! The facts seem to deny that. She profited from our rivalry. and attempted to rob us both! The proof is she was caught running away with the money! I accuse this woman of robbery and homicide! I don't know if this accusation of yours will be worth much. Because a husband can't testify against his own wife. There's something you don't know, Sheriff. This woman is my wife. Take her away. I'll lock this in my office. But the judge must decide what to do next. I suggest you don't go too far, Kluster. Thank you for recovering that cash, All right... I'd certainly say that you earned your fair share of it. Well, Mr Kluster. You'll get a surprise when you get what's coming to you! He'll push you out! Nice of you, Mr Kluster. to have this shindig. Oh, you should thank Django. We wanted a party to celebrate our new agreement that we signed. I see! May I have this dance, Miss Lucy? - Oh, yes! - Thanks, Excuse us. You're afraid you'd lose the pleasure of killing us! I could have done that any time I wanted. You must still love me. That's why you've set me free, You don't hate me. Doc... You're such a fool, darling! Sentiment is always a mistake. Good bye, Doc! For once I have trapped you! If you open that door. you'll be facing Kluster. He's the one who'll kill you. You're wrong! There isn't anybody out there! Now that we've enjoyed ourselves, let's get to work. May I have the pleasure of this dance? Do you mind, Sheriff? Sure I mind! You're the prettiest girl here! Hey, I asked her, not you! Oh, yeah? Sorry, Sheriff! Good luck, and don't take too long! Excuse me, folks, I want another drink. If I'm killed here. They'll believe you did it for the money, and hang you. OK, Django, It's all yours. Pick it up! Take my share, too. It's a third of a million dollars! I'm paying plenty for the mistakes I made! There's one more thing for you to pay, Kluster. My fathers death. Sorry, Dad. I know you don't care for the idea of having your worst enemy share your grave. But now that he's disappeared. They'll think he ran away with the money. Listen, Dad, This will give you a big laugh. I'm going to put a big price on his head. Just like the one he put on yours! I swear, Dad, this is the last favor I'll ask. - How's the party? - Great! Here! Let me see. Come on! Hurry! There, No one will ever look for it here. Let's go upstairs. Excuse me. Hold on. Oh, thanks. Sorry, Sheriff. I reckon it was all our fault. At least Kluster's going to blame it on us. Where is he? Where's Kluster? He's disappeared. Sheriff! Sheriff! I was knocked out! Someone killed Mrs Kluster. and ran off with all that money! It was Kluster! No doubt about it! He's the only one who's missing. He slipped off in all the confusion to get even with her! We better get moving with a posse! I'll capture that rattlesnake. even if I have to turn every stone in the West! Better have them bandage that up, son. Hold on, Sheriff. I'm coming with you. No, thanks, Django, I figure you've done plenty already. From now on I'll take over. - All right, Sheriff. - I'll see you later. - Django's gone. - Yeah, to buy some tobacco. Buy what tobacco? He's gone with Doc and Gordon. I even heard they were headed for Mexico. But weren't you fixing to marry him? That's another one you let get away. Take my word for it, You don't know how to handle him. - Well, you just wait. - What for? I know he's coming home again. Because he has good reason, as he will discover. Gordon, are you going to ride all the way to Mexico looking backwards? Well, I spent all my life in Silver Creek. I never expected you'd get homesick. Naturally, I'm getting homesick. For the bank and everything we left in that town. And Lucy, Have you forgotten her? If I'd spent another day with her. She might have convinced me to marry her. I'm not the kind to sit behind a table. I like the outdoor life. Especially when I got a third of a million! I plan to do a lot with my money. So long, friends, I'm riding on to Mexico. Maybe I can forget what's happened and start over again. Take your share of the money. No, I didn't earn it, You have and you deserve it. "I'll always wait for you, Yours, Lucy." I didn't think she would give up so easily! If you need another witness when you marry Lucy. Please write to Durango. Take my advice, Django, Go back. I'll see you. I'd say you're going to be one of the marrying kind. - Morning, Mr Garvin. - Morning. What security have you got? - 500 head of cattle, that's what! - That'll do. - Morning. - Morning. - 150,200... - Morning. $200? I said I wanted to borrow $400. The difference is the interest, We deduct the interest in advance. - Gordon! - Is that against the law? Till this evening. Can I help you? Jesse Kluster. Ken Kluster's son. I understand that I own 50% of all your property.
