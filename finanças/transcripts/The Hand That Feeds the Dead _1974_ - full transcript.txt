EVIL FACE Wake up, Vanya. Wake up! I want another one. I want another one. - What are you doing? - Come on! - Please stop! - Let me touch you. Don't move. Stop now! No! Who are you? What do you want? Help me! Help me! Take her away and make her disappear. Hey, host! Do you have room? With pleasure, my Lord. Our inn is the best here. We have great bedrooms and good food. If you give us the honour to enter, you'll see it yourself. I don't like it. It's better if you stop here, trust me. There aren't other inns for another 100 miles from here. Let's go Alex. Maybe next time. - Go! - Yes, Sir! The Lady... I don't like it! Go to HeII! People from the city are all the same. Did you mind, Iove? I didn't like their faces. Aren't you tired? I prefer the scent of the countryside for our first wedding night. What do you think, Alex? I'm scared! Don't worry. Come! Look! My head... Look! My wife! Help her! Look, Master. I'll talk to our Lady. I gave her a sedative. She was more scared than anything eIse. I can't imagine how we could survive without your help. Doctor... Nijinsky. You just need to rest. And tomorrow morning you'll feel just fine. It was a terrible adventure. I think that you, doctor... made a miracle saving us. A real luck. Well, I'm finished here. I wish you a good night. Good evening, Professor. I've never chased a man... Why did you start then? Come in. Are you scared? What should I be scared of? I don't know, but since you didn't talk to me lateIy... I could think... When you invited me for a romantic holiday... it seemed the most important thing for you. It is like that. I've been here for a week... and besides our meeting for lunch or somewhere else... Is there something wrong with me? No. It's good to know. So? Why? Why do you always steer clear of me? I'm sorry I can't. But why? I like you. Why are you complaining? You have all what you were looking for. And you've been well payed too. It doesn't make any sense. When I'm payed, they ask me something back. Don't worry. You'll pay your due. Theodor! Katiuscia. - My love! - Katiuscia! I can't stand to be far from you! My love, I think I found the right answer. Here? In Doctor Nijinsky's house? That's impossible! But I'm sure. You know that I'm eager to know as much as you are... but it seems so impossible. Yes, I know. But I am sure. It would be terrible. It is. Listen. You could be in danger! I'm not afraid. What if they are guilty? My curiosity is justified by the fact that I'm writing a book. Oh my dear! Anyway, my Iove... I'm looking forward to the end of this story. I think I should go to talk to the poIice. I'd tell them our doubts... our fears. Do you understand? Crazy! You are crazy! I should give up looking at myself... and living here as a prisoner. Agnieszka. How is this possible? It's impossible to go on. I can't stand it any longer. You look great! Thank you. I can't remember a thing since that moment... Our mind refuses bad things. Some people forget easily! Miss Holleroch, how is your research going? Good. I'm aImost finished. It will be a great book. Myth and truth of Baron Rassimov. I'm curious to read the finished copy. You'll be the first one, don't worry. Are you writing a book? Yes. It's about a story that few people know. Baron Rassimov was a great man. He died during a professional accident before... a very important scientific discovery. Baron Rassimov... I heard this name before. What was this discovery about? Professor Nijinsky could explain you better. He's been the Baron's assistant for many years. He's also his son-in-law and heir. His daughter is the heir. I mean, heir of his teachings. You are wrong, Miss. When he died, he brought his secrets with him. Does his daughter live here? Yes, of course. My wife never recovered from her father's death. She lives with her memories. She is far from the real worId. If I'm not too inquisitive, I'd like to know more about these experiments. Yes, please. And let us visit his grave too. I know he's buried here. What do you think? Of course! I'd like it too. If this is not too inquisitive for you. No. I don't think it's an indiscretion. It is always a pleasure to talk about my Master. The grave is in the underground. Follow me, please. His reasearch made him create in his laboratory... a human cell. Some mean and envious scientists thought he was crazy... due to his brave scientific theories. Other people thought he was a genius. I, who had the honour... to enjoy his confidence for many years... I think that the world is one step behind since his death. Many times he was almost successful... but there was aIways a mysterious force opposing to his attempts. TiII that tragic event. So, he brought his secrets in his grave. That's a pity. He thought that it was possible to make human transplantations... like for vegetable grafts. Was he able to do them? Yes, some. But he was unable to prove his theories. He died in a fire during his last experiment. A real tragedy. I think the ladies can't stand it anymore. Please. I feel stunned. These mysteries make me scared. My God! You missed an interesting story. Yes, but I was thirsty. There some water if you want. Thank you. Excuse me... you look pale like you've seen a ghost. The truth is not that far from what you've just said. I found this in a drawer. It's a ring that belongs to my sister. Masha! Masha, my love! Masha! What happened? I looked for you everywhere. Nothing dear. Forgive me, I didn't hear you... Are you sick? You look so pale. It's not what you are thinking. That girl, the writer... told me a terrible story. And you got scared. Didn't you know that writers have a great fantasy? Yes, but it doesn't seem a writer's fantasy. She thinks that our guest... is the responsible of her sister's and other girls' disappearance. I think she tried on you the effects of the book she's writing. You have to understand, Inspector... that there have been many disappearances. And all the girls that disappeared here... didn't leave any trace. I agree, my dear friend. But before I could accuse an esteemed family... I need something more. I told you more than good reasons... so that you could start an investigation. Unless Nijinsky's name is too powerful. Powerful... Of course. That's why I need evidences. More powerful is their name, more evidences I need. Will you let them go on with their game? I can't do anything, I need more evidences. Find them. We'll find them. We'll surely find them. Give power. Go and call our Lady. Theodor! What's wrong? I thought you wouldn't come. What happened? I don't have doubts now. Did you find out... something important? Yes. Look. Look at this ring. My sister had one like this. I think it's hers. - You could be wrong. - No! I'm sure, do you understand? - This changes things. - Yes. Come! We can't waste time! Where are we going? To meet the Inspector. Quick! This time he will listen to me! Are you sure he will help us? He promised me. We have an evidence! Go! Come in! Good evening, Inspector. - Oh, it's you. - Miss Onenov. Good evening. Please take a sit. Please. I'm sorry I have to bother you now. What is the reason for you to come here? Here, Inspector! You asked for an evidence, and here you have it! It was between other jewels in the Professor's room. This one belonged to my sister. The last time someone saw her, she was wearing it. Many rings like this one are soId everywhere. Yes, but... this is a peculiar event! Don't you think so? Miss, you have to tell me everything you know about this matter. So you think that this girl was kidnapped... and used for some experiments? I don't know what happened to her. But I'm sure that the house and its... undergrounds could answer your questions. My fiance's life... could be in danger! Someone could realize the ring disappeared... and could hide the evidences making fun of us! I'll think about it. Come. Katiuscia, do you really have to go there again? I don't feel comfortable knowing you are there. Don't worry, Theodore. Try to pay attention. My Iove! I'll see you tomorrow. All right. Stop! Stop! Stop, you stupid beast! Who's there? It's me Katya, open. What's going on? What happened? Tell me! That lame man, their servant, he tried to enter here. Everybody is strange in this house. Sonia, they are criminals! Not strange people as you say! Oh come on! Don't go too far! You are making a simple thing bigger than it is! I'd like to show you something. What? Look! Nice. It's my sister's picture. We don't know where she is. She was on holidays with a friend in a nearby village. One day, we had no more news from her. Disappeared! Do you understand? We didn't receive any news! Maybe a love adventure. Couldn't it be like that? Maybe she couldn't... Come on, don't cry... She should have let us know something... And I'm sure she was hidden somewhere here. How can it be possible? Maybe in this house. You don't believe me, Sonia, do you? You know, you can be wrong too. I think that the explanation is in this house. It looks just like an ordinary house to me. Yes, outside. But it has a fearful atmosphere. - Lay down now. - It's like that! Come on, rest now. You'll feel fine soon. You made me wait for you, Vanya. Come here, I need you. Come. I thought about what you told me. Everything seems so strange. There must be something real. She couldn't have made everything up. Alex, I feel better now and... I think it would be better to leave this house as soon as we can. It could seem rude. They are so nice to us. I have this feeling, I don't feel comfortable. Good morning. I hope I haven't disturbed your privacy. Of course not. Please, sit down. Everybody weakes up late in this house. Don't you have breakfast with your wife? She doesn't like it. We're sorry we cannot meet her. Right. We are thinking to leave. We've been treated nicely and we'd like to say goodbye. And to thank her as well. BeIieve me when I say I'd be very happy... if it was possible. But she's never accepted to meet anybody. I'm sorry. How can she live far from the real worId? She's like that since her father's death. You suffer too. I got used to it. Well, we decided to start again our... wedding trip that was interrupted so badly. I'll order to set up everything. - Mayor. - Good morning, Judge! - Please take a sit. - Thank you! What is the reason for this meeting? The girls' disappearance and the accusations to the Baron. Even if I try to imagine it... I can't understand what links the disappearances with Baron Nijinsky. We have to pay attention, a lot of attention to what we do. We have the evidence of what we are saying! What evidences? A girl's word? That girl gave us enough reasons to proceed. If the Baron is innocent, he doesn't have to... fear for an inquiry. It will be discreet and confidential. And it won't offend anybody's sensitiveness. I agree. But think about that... it's an important family. That is why we are here. We know what would happen. So? I'm worried this time. You could reject it. You made ten transplantations on my body and everything went fine! My father's discovery let a quick cicatrization... and now you are not sure! If this attempt would fall... you would die. I've been in this grave since years... and now that we have the chance... should I give up? And you are asking me that! You could die! I trust you, Sergej. You've been my father's best student. You gave up to a great career in order to... be with me and cure me! We won't have this luck again. Can you make me live like the other women? I could become a real wife for you. You can't leave me like that. I've never let you down. I never will. But the risk is too big. Only this surgical operation could justify... the risks we faced till now. Don't tell me! The lives we sacrificed till today would be wasted in vain! Your body reconstruction, after it was destroyed by fire... took many lives. Too many, Tanya. The result matters, Sergej! Try to pay attention. That girl, the writer... found out something. Don't leave witnesses alive, and remember... I'll be a real wife... when I'll be a real woman! I'll be a real wife when I'll be a real woman! I'll be a real wife when I'll be a real woman! The result matters! A real woman! A real woman! A real woman! The results matter! A real woman! A real woman! A real woman! The resuIts matter! A real woman! A real woman! A real woman! It's you. Come here Katya, come. I was thinking about you. What's wrong? I feel lonely. A beautiful girl like you! I'm not saying that just as a compliment. You look better like that, don't you know? I'd like to talk to you. Are you...? Professor Nijinsky's wife. Alex! Just you, thank you. Wake up, Alex! - Alex! - What? What will you do? Maybe she needs my help. This is not the right time. You behave like a child. Don't be influenced by that. Wait till tomorrow if you really want to talk to her. I don't think this is urgent. She was in pain. She was really in pain. All right. This is strange. During the night, suddenly... when she could talk to you tomorrow anytime. I want to talk to her. I want to talk to her. Forgive me if I bothered you during the night. But I get out of my room only during the night. You didn't bother me. I wanted to meet you too. Sometimes I can't stand loneliness. It was a nightmare. And when they came to help me... and dragged me out from the ruins, I was fainted. It must have been an awful experience! Why do you go off by yourself and keep your sorrow? You could have travel, seen people... I wish I could have done that... but I wasn't strong enough. Maybe my husband didn't tell you the whole story. Haven't you asked yourself why I cover my face with a veil? It's not for the sorrow of my father's loss. This is my bedroom. There are no mirrors. I don't want to see my face. I don't run away from other people, but from me! From what I became. There are no candles or fire. That damned fire that killed my father... destroyed me too! Look. My God! This is why I've never wanted to see people. And for ten years, I've been living here as a prisoner. Oh my Lady, I wish I could help you. Your arrival to this house has been providential. You'll give me all the help I need. What does this mean? How can I help you? The best one. The only one that could help me to get out from this prison. No! No! Let me go! Let me go! What do you want from me? I need a face. Yours! We need you! What does this mean? Your holiday is over. I told you! He wants to kill us! You know too much. No! Let me go! help! Let me go! What do you want to do with that thing? Why? Why? They have to disappear. Leave me, you beast! Go away! I'm ready, Sergej. Masha! Masha? Is anybody there? Sonia! Sonia! Sonia... Let me out! Let me out from here! help me! Open here! Open here! I want to get out! Who are you? Answer me! Help me please! Who are you? Open here! Help me! Open here! - Don't leave me alone. - I can't. It's Alex! Open here! Open! Help me! Yes! Please, help me! Come on! Push, please! Help me! I'll help you too! Quick! Come on! Just a small effort! Come on! Please help me! Please help me! Come on! Let's do it together! Come on! Now! I can't! Now! It moved! It moved! Come on! Come on! I would have died without your help. Thank you. What do these people want from us? They killed my sister. They want to kill us too. The police knows it. Call it! Don't worry, I'll go to look for help! Try to resist! Everything went fine. Better than I thought. You can get up. Don't be afraid. Look yourself at the mirror. You can do it now without being afraid. You succeeded! You really succeeded! Even this woman's husband could recognize you! This woman's husband! This woman's husband. It's true. I'm another woman. Another woman. It's a pity that nobody will ever know about this success. Nobody will ever know. It's true. Another woman. And nobody will ever know! Nobody will ever know it! We must be cautious. There will be an inquiry. We'll hide all the evidences. And when everything calms down... We'll leave for a long trip. Nobody will ever know. Nobody will ever know. How do you feel, Alex? Good, Masha. Does your head hurt? What happened? My head! It seems it will bIow up! Who brought me here? I did it, my Iove. It was not simple. Rest now. Don't stress yourself too much. I'll explain you everything when you feel better. Now you just need to rest. No! I have to remember. There was a girl... I was closed inside a coffin. What happened, Masha? Who attacked me? He won't hurt no more. It's a weird story that is over. It seems that the doctor and his wife, she was a doctor too... tried to start again her father's experiments. What experiments? I didn't understand what they wanted to do to me. But they didn't make it on time. What are you talking about? Where are they now. They had a secret lab in the underground. It's where they probably made their experiments. Someone brought me there when I was unconscious. I haven't seen anything. When I woke up... they were dead. It was terrible. Then I looked for you! I thought I wouldn't make it, Alex. What horrible honeymoon I gave you! Poor love! We have to leave as soon as we can. Alex... Yes, Alex. You are right. Take me away from here. Take me far away, where I can forget. Where I can live. Wake up, Alex! Please, wake up! What happened? - What happened? - I think I saw someone. Where? Alex. My love. Are you still afraid? Only of what could let us part. Agnieszka! We ended the same way. She abandoned us. Like two useless things. With no mercy. Tanya! My love! How could you do that? Why? She knew it. She knew she'd have abandoned me when I had given her back her beauty. She needed me. Now, Agnieszka, can you see how she treated us? She gave her body to another man! You knew I loved her so much. She shouldn't do it! If she asked me... I would have let her go. It's over. Tell her... Tell her! I loved her so much! We set everything, Madame. The Professor's body was not in the Iab... but in his wife's bedroom. Maybe I was wrong. I was scared, I can't remember exactly. Don't worry. Would you like me to leave you a guard? I don't think it is necessary. When my husband is ready, we'll leave here. All right, Madame. Come. Why didn't you tell me everything yesterday? You were still in shock. But my dear! With all those corpses! What could we do? I worried about you only! What was that? I don't know. Nobody should be here. I go to check. I'm here, Tanya. I'm here. I'm waiting for you. Come! I'm here. Next to you. It could have been the wind... I... Masha? Where are you? Where...? Come, Tanya. I'm waiting for you. Come. I'm here, Tanya! Can't you see me? I'm here! Next to you. Here! Here! No, Sergej! Masha? I know what you want to do. I won't let you do it! I won't let you do it! Never! No! - Are you scared? - Not the fire! No! No! No! Not the fire! You'll destroy yourself! No! You wanted too much! Have mercy! No! No! No! No! Damned! Let me go! Damned! Damned! It's too late. Help me, Sergej! It's too late. Masha? No!
