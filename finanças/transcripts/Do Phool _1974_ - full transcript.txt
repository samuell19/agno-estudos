Go.. go please. Go! Why don't you go ahead? - I don't want to go. Rascal. - Hooligan. - Fools! What did you say? - They called us flowers. Oh.. flowers! - Not flowers.. you all are stupid fools! Follow! - Let them go. - Follow her! - Follow! "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Have you gone mad?" "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Have you gone mad?" "Beloved, don't roam in the sun with such a complexion." "Come darling, walk into my heart." "Beloved, don't roam in the sun with such a complexion." "Come darling, walk into my heart." "I am a girl, think about it and don't embarrass me." "Kill me with your eyes." "And bring me to life by banging into me." I had told you. - You don't listen. - Shut up! "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Have you gone mad?" "Why do you run away from me?" "Am I that bad, beloved?" "Why are you in a rush?" "Have you promised someone anything?" "Why do you run away from me?" "Am I that bad, beloved?" "Why are you in a rush?" "Have you promised someone anything?" "Let go.. move back." "Why are you standing in front of me?" "Darling, see and walk." "Even we are also there in your paths." I feel like crying. - Don't cry baby. Shut up! "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Have you gone mad?" "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Have you gone mad?" Come gentlemen.. come. Greetings! Greetings! Please sit. Please sit! Today all the wealthy people of the city have come to my home. Tell me how come you all are here so early in the morning. Diwan Bahadur, we are there because of you. Did you see the blueprints of our plastic factory? Yes, I have seen them. So all of you want to put 35 lakhs into it. - Yes, sir. 35 lakhs, hard cash. The project should start on a big scale. So I contribute 25 lakhs. 25 lakhs! Kishan Singh! - Yes sir. - Prepare a cheque for 25 lakhs. Leave me! I had worked hard for it. - Where are you going? Guests are sitting inside. I have waited for quite sometime now. He must be a king in his own house. I am not going to get scared of him. Who is this ill mannered person? Why will you recognize me? You throw so much of attitude when you are in your car. I have a shop of beetle leaf and cigarettes next door. Who orders for beetle leaf and cigarettes in the house? I don't know sir. - Then how did he come inside? Ask your children who smoke cigarettes at my shop. What.. what is he saying? Yes, it has been 2 months since.. ..they have taken a loan for Rs. 55.25. And they don't seem to repay it back. Kishan Singh! Do my children smoke? I don't know sir. I have never seen them. Respected people, he doesn't know what his children do. He just has his eyes on money and nothing else. Listen, take him outside. Give him a 100 rupee note and let him go. - Okay sir. Tell your son that I am not going.. ..to give them any loan from now. They come in the morning to eat my head. Respected people, 100 rupees are given every day for vegetables. Can my sons take loan for Rs. 55.25? Diwan Bahadur, you are absolutely right. See, I had an expectation of 15 lakhs. - But he gave 25 lakhs. What is he saying? It means you understood, right? - Take this. Thank you. Diwan Bahadur, we will take your leave now Thank you! Thank you! - Greetings! Where are you? Malti! Did you hear? - I heard. You had put your ear next to the door. I have told you many times that this habit is not good. But it is a habit of mothers. Which mother will not hear when things.. ..are being said against her children? Are you an enemy to your children? I am not their enemy but you are! You have spoilt both of them with your love and affection. Because of them that good for nothing.. ..shopkeeper insulted me in front of everyone. What are you talking? You gave him 100 rupees instead of 55.25. Your respect got better with that. Wow! Wow! Wow! Why are you so hungry? - What do I do? Hungry! Hungry! Hungry! I mean why do you get boiled up like that? Don't you understand? - Not hungry, it is angry! My father had got an illiterate daughter-in-law. Don't try to act literate in your old age. Have some shame! Hello! - Is respected Diwan Bahadur sir speaking? Yes, I am speaking. Who is this? I am his son Pavitra Kumar i.e. Puttan. - Fool! My younger brother, that is your second.. ..son Charitra Kumar i.e. Chuttan is also here. None of you all are good for anything. Where are you calling from? From my mouth. - Get me my stick. Are they my sons? - Leave it. Hello. - Father, you have called us with all the bad names. If there are any other titles remaining then say that too. Fool, thief, burglar! First answer me. Where are you both? - They have gone to Mahableshwar. Mahableshwar? - Yes. - Without asking me? Why would they ask you, when.. ..you are not bothered about them. It's been 3 days since they have left. They have gone since 3 days. Don't worry father! We have reached Pune, will be there in a few hours. Tell mom to prepare hot food for us. I am not your servant to tell your mom to make food. Look at these ill mannered children. How have they become! Hello? Hello? Hello! Talk to them. Hello? Hello? What should I talk? They have kept the phone. Hey! Come down. Be quick! How dare you all! Your father has some respect. Exactly! - Shut up! Both of you had gone to Mahableshwar. That too for 3 days. Without my permission! Stop all this drama! Chuttan and Puttan, what happened to you both? We caught a cold. Mahabaleshwar is a cold place. They must be out there without a.. ..muffler and so they must have caught a cold. They don't have a cold, they have too much of attitude. They need to be taught a lesson. - Shut up! It seems that you have become an enemy of my children. Come let's go quick and apply balm on your head. You all will be absolutely fine after that. Of course, go ahead and do that! And even sing them a poem too. They have become so big.. ..but they still don't realise their responsibility. Shut up! Through out the day you just shout at them.. ..then how will they understand? You must make children understand with love. - Yes. Shut up! I know what good your affection has done to them. Hey! - My 2 sons are priceless. Priceless! Now what they can do when their father doesn't have fat on them? Fat means? - Fat! Fat! Don't you know English? Illiterate! It is called faith! Why do you ruin English language? I meant the same thing. At least try giving them the responsibility. They will realize their responsibility. And they will have even a better name than you. They won't be famous. - What did you say? I am telling you that they will be famous. Fine. As you say. Greetings! Greetings! - Greetings! Boss, you haven't come in the office of the company. Yes, I was busy with other companies. What is the matter? Some important paper needs to be signed. - Give me. Give it to me! What did my sons do now? - I am giving them a responsibility. Come here! Manager! - Yes. - I am signing these papers today. From tomorrow these two people are your boss. Greetings boss! Greetings! Good morning sir! - Good morning sir! - Greetings! Are you listening? It is 7 o'clock and the children aren't home yet? What do you mean? They must be really working hard. Do you know they didn't even come to.. ..eat lunch in the afternoon at home too. They will be famous! They are priceless! I wish that comes true! Our sons should be successful! Should I go to the office and see what they are doing? Why do you have to go? Just call the manager and ask. Yes I shall call the manager. Boss, you don't need to go anywhere. I am here. How come you are here? Don't ask that. How are my sons working? - Don't ask that too. How is the office doing? - It is full of fun and frolic. "Take a puff!" "Your sadness will go away!" "Say throughout the day." "Hare Krishna Hare Ram!" "Hare Krishna Hare Ram!" "Hare Krishna Hare Ram!" - "Hare Krishna Hare Ram!" "Take a puff!" "Your sadness will go away!" "Say throughout the day." "Hare Krishna Hare Ram!" "Hare Krishna Hare Ram!" "Hare Krishna Hare Ram!" - "Hare Krishna Hare Ram!" "What did the world give us?" "What did we take from the world?" Brown sugar! - This has brown sugar! Wait and come here! Both of you come back! - Both of you go and explain. Don't explain to me, get the place cleaned up. Come here. What is your name? Come here. Clean all this! Hold me! Kiss me! Feel me! Clean all of that! Father, why are you firing them? We are the boss here. I have made you all the boss. And I will only ruin you all. Come home. I will insult you in front of everyone. Mother of these priceless sons! Where are you? Come outside. - See that. My sons have come. Get the ovaltine! They will drink that later, first welcome them. They have made us very proud today! Mother! - My sons! Welcome them a little more harshly. Why are you getting so angry? I am not getting angry, I am regretting on what I did. I was not in my senses when I listened to you. I should be insulted instead of you. What is the rush? Let them drink ovaltine first. Yes, let them drink. Drink it. Give me. - Mother. - Yes. - This is the milk with cream. Yes dear. - Mother, put more sugar. - Yes. What madness is this? Mother, this is nothing new. You know father, right? - Yes, mother. Shut up! - What is the point in remaining quiet father? You have spilt the entire ovaltine over the floor. I want to even spill you all over the floor. Are they some mat that you will spread them over the floor? What has happened to you today? These children of donkeys.. - Right father. - Shut up! These fools had turned our office into a disc. They had left their work and were busy dancing with girls. With girls? - Is that true dear? Mother, we were taking their test. Typists should be smart in big offices. Mother, 2 of them didn't even know to dance. Mother! - Yes dear! Mother, tell father to remove those females. And keep 2 smart females in the office. Did you hear, your sons want to have.. ..fun with the females in the office. I have understood it and I have a solution to this. They will become fine. You must have found out an illiterate solution only. It is the same solution that your father.. ..used to make you come on the right track. What are you talking about? Mother, which solution did grandfather have? Mother, how did grandfather make father straight? Should I tell them? - Who knows what you will speak? Mother. - Mother. - I will tell. - Father, listen to us. Father, listen to us. Papa. Our father is very smart. He kicked us out at the last minute. Or else we would find a solution to escape his scolding. Buddy, we are no less than our father. I had switched on the switch of.. ..the intercom when I left from there. Just switch on the button and listen to them talk. You are great! This is not an illiterate solution. This is what has been going on since ages. Even the naughtiest people.. ..come on the right track after marriage. Puttan, our father is already married. Yes but it is old now. Now to cure him we will have to get them remarried. But who will give him their girl. He has become old. So what? He will find someone older like him. Just see in our caste, people are waiting.. ..in Jews to give their daughter to my sons. Jew or queue? - Yes that only. But I liked what you said. It will be very difficult to find them their brides. Don't you have faith on me? Mr. Secretary. - Yes. - Just tell.. ..him what that lawyer was telling you. Sir, the lawyer from Azadnagar, Vardhraj.. ..wants to make Chuttan sir his son-in-law. Puttan, mom and dad want to get me married. Now what do we do? - First you get married then we will think. How do I get married? I haven't even seen the girl yet. Then come, let us see where.. ..does lawyer Vardhraj stay in Azadnagar. Vardhraj.. B.A. L.L.B.. Advocate. Puttan, this is the house. Chuttan, there is one Vardhraj here too. But he is a doctor not a lawyer. I don't seem to understand what is the matter? Matter? One minute. Watchman! What is this weird thing? Are there 2 people with the same.. ..name or one name that has 2 professions. Sir, our boss is both a lawyer and a doctor. Chuttan! Chuttan! Poonam, my dad has spoken about my marriage to Diwan Bahadur. It is a very rich house. They have servants, cars, everything. It is obvious that even the guy must be educated. You are very lucky dear. I am just a sister of an Inspector. Where will I get such a big house from? Why won't you find one? Just impress some guy who is from a rich house. We just have one big house in mind. - Which one? - Prison. So then find someone from there. Chuttan. - Yes. - They are the same ones from Mahableshwar. Yes, I know. But who is the girl amongst them? What are you saying? Both of them are girls. What are you seeing? - That is fine. But who is the girl that is for me? She is the one next to my girl. Who is your girl? The one who is not yours. What is this? Who is my girl! We have to find this out, why are you shouting? How will we find out? What are you talking? Will you now fight with me? Am I fighting? - I am not fighting. Catch them! Catch them! Why were you all trying to run away? You wanted to escape! You all had come here to rob something? We had not come here to rob something. We had come to see something. Father! They are those naughty people! They are those gangsters! Chuutan, the one who is calling out to her father is yours. Puttan, the quiet one is yours. What nonsense are you speaking? And ask us uncle, they were the.. ..one who were teasing us in Mahabaleshwar. Yes, section no. 354, misbehaving with girls. Uncle, to break into the house.. ..without permission is section no. 448. Yes, I will do a double case on them. I will teach them a lesson. Lawyer sir, you will teach us a.. ..lesson when you put a case on us. But we gave your case to you. It has doubled! You are the lawyer of this case. Don't worry about it. - You will get double fees for it. Uncle, these 2 are very smart. They are saying that you will fight the case against yourself. Hey you baldy! What ever hair is.. ..left on your head I will clear it too. Get out! Listen, doctor sir. The matter is between us. Not of this baldy. You have a point. I will just go and decide everything. Shyamlal, make the both of them wait here. - We are waiting. We believe you lawyer sir. You may go and decide. - But think of both of us. - Fine. Trimbak! Trimbak, where are you? - I am here uncle. Come with me. - Come. "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Shut up!" "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Have you gone mad?" "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Have you gone mad?" "Shut-up" "You have come with a lot of love." "Don't sneak at us like that." "Beloved, I have tied you in the delicate thread of love." "You have come with a lot of love." "Don't sneak at us like that." "Beloved, I have tied you in the delicate thread of love." "I am telling you beloved to forgive me." "This bond will now not break and.. ..you can keep on regretting it." I had said that you implicated me. - You did! - You did! Shut up! "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Have you gone mad?" "You had promised to meet me but.. ..I have been waiting here since quite a long time." "I will hit my false beloved with a stick of flowers." "You had promised to meet me but.. ..I have been waiting here since quite a long time." "I will hit my false beloved with a stick of flowers." "I am delicate, don't push me.. ..I will start crying, you have my swear." "Don't cry, I also will start crying, I swear by you." Don't cry! Don't cry! I am telling you not to cry. Shut up. "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Have you gone mad?" "Forgive me! - Forgive me!" "Let go! - Let go!" "Oh Lord! - Oh Lord!" "Leave me! - Leave me!" "Have you gone mad?" "Shut up!" Come Inspector sir, come. See here are those 2 scoundrels. Hands cuff them. You all have tied them up well. Their punishment has started from home itself. Brother, we have given them this punishment. And they are even affected by it. See, they are really guilty. Who are you? Who are you? They and here? - Yes. Do you know them? - Very well lawyer sir. They are the children of a very big man. Diwan Bahadur Atal Rai. Constable! - What? - I mean Inspector sir. If you want to take the name of our father.. ..then take it properly. Atal Rai! - Oh! So they are Diwan Bahadur Atal Rai's sons. If I had sent them to jail.. ..then what would I have told Diwan Bahadur? I have sent him a message saying that.. ..I want his son to be my son-in-law. - This goon? Don't worry! I will punish him for sure. May be not officially. Uncle, if you like homely people.. ..then find the son-in-law in the house only. What are you talking? Which guy is in my house that I can take as my son-in-law? Am I not in the house? You can't even see with specs. Oh no! I have died! - They killed us! You? - Yes, we are there. - What is it? We will take revenge from you. - For what? You both have insulted us. - So then what will you do? We both will marry you both. Have you lost it? Shaila! Shaila! Come here. These 2 are those people right? Yes Kanta. They are the same ones. Ask her to find a match for herself. - Shut up! What do you all think about marriage? - No. Keep the refusal with yourself. - And think. If you don't give us an answer till tomorrow afternoon. Then we will commit suicide outside your lane. Come on Puttan! - Excuse me! It seems that your sons have created a chaos.. ..at the land that you have next to that crossroads. They were born for this. What are they doing now? They want to kill themselves. I have heard that they are digging their own grave. I see. Then do one thing Inspector sir. Send a few craftsmen for their help. -I'm not kidding Diwan sir I can arrest your sons because.. ..they are creating public nuisance. Go and stop your sons, or else it will bad for you. Hail to the grave of love! Hail to the grave of love! Youth. - Is a disease! Youth. - Is a disease! Passion! - Is a disease! Passion! - Is a disease! Shaila! Shaila! Shaila! - What is it? The grave has started building. - What? Yes, I just saw I when I was coming here by cab. But I thought they were just kidding about it. Oh Lord! They are really going to commit suicide. We will be blamed for their death. Now what will happen? Say, what will happen? - Wait! Let me think. Hail to the grave of love! Hail Chuttan Puttan! Hail to the grave of love! Hail Chuttan Puttan! Chuttan, they haven't come till now. Brother, even the crowd is too much. I don't see any chance of getting saved. Do you love Chuttan? - I like him. Do you love Puttan? I also like him. But if he gives his.. ..life for me then I will love him. - Even me. Just see how many minutes are left. Only 5 minutes. - Only 5 minutes! Chuttan! - Yes. - Our death is nearing soon. Now we will have to die. Hail Chuttan Puttan! Puttan, see there! Hail Chuttan Puttan! Hail to the grave of love! Hail Chuttan Puttan! Chuttan! - Puttan! - Puttan! We really respect females a lot! Be happy females we are going to die. Chuttan, please don't die. Puttan don't give your life away. - I won't. Give your hand in mine. Let us shake hands fast or else we shall leave. Chuttan, I am telling you to shut it. - Shut it! Yes.. yes, it is a yes. Do you agree? - Yes. Puttan! - Yes Chuttan. - Cancel the grave. Break the grave. - Break it. Can I come inside? Come, please come. You will tell me.. ..something new that they have done. If your Diwan Bahadur sir, then I am advocate Vardhraj. Oh, you are advocate Vardhraj. Please come. Make yourself comfortable. No, I have not come to sit here. I have come to complain to you. Do you know what your sons have done? I know that I won't be shocked. Tell me what they have done. They have done 354 and 448 both. You mean to say they have started gambling. No they haven't gambled I am talking about section no. 354. They both entered my house and teased my daughters.. Fools! You have started teasing descent girls. Father, we didn't tease them we had just gone to see them. Shut up! Diwan Bahadur sir, I have kept your respect. Or else I would have sent them to jail. I had both of the points, 354 and 448. I understood. I apologize on their behalf. You have been really grateful. Diwan Bahadur sir, punish them. - Yes. Only then will they learn. - Yes. Think about what I said. Greetings! Father.. - You fools! You have ruined my name! Father, one chance.. - Get out! - What happened? It is my order. Don't step inside this house. Listen to me! - What should I listen? Why are you removing my children out of the house? I should have removed them when.. ..they had failed 4 times in their 10th. At least my name would not have got ruined today. But at least tell me, what have they done? They have insulted me. - They have Don't irritate me! I will never let them enter this.. They don't have any effect of what I said. Get up! What did I order you all to do? Don't ever enter through the door. - Then why have you come? Father, we have not come through the door. We have come in through the window. Now don't step into this compound ever. Get out! - Where will my innocent children go? Let them go to hell. Get out! Get out from here. - Father! Listen carefully; we don't have any relation henceforth. I am not your father and nor are you all my children. Father, at least keep one relation. Get out! Chuttan! Puttan! My sons! - Mother! - My dear! Mother, your husband has insulted us very badly. Without thinking he said that we are not his sons. Think mother, what if we would have back.. ..answered him and told him that he is not my father. Then what would your position be? You would be very insulted. Dear, forget all of that. - We can't forget that, mother. We will take our revenge from our father. We will make our father accept that we are his sons. Isn't it Puttan? - Yes Chuttan. Dear, don't say like this. Don't say like this. When his anger cools down, everything will be fine. Till that time go and stay in the bungalow at Mahabaleshwar. Why are you giving us exile. You are not Kekai, you are Kaushaliya. How will your sons walk 180 miles? Take these 2000 rupees. But your father should not know about this? - Why? Have you stolen them from father's pocket? Don't talk nonsense, and go fast. Okay mother. - Dear, take care of your health. Eat your food on time. Mother, you send money order on time. - I will. Reach Mahabaleshwar, we will tell you everything there. Now how should we take revenge of mother from father? I don't seem to understand. Chuttan, if God had made us a little.. ..more witty, then nothing would go wrong. We have just got one thing, our parents love. Wrong! Only mother loves us. Father is just a killer. Killer! Murderer! What did you say? Father is a killer? I mean there is only blood relation with our father. Blood relation! Killer! Blood! Chuttan! - Yes. I got a plan. - What kind of a plan? My blood, relation will be yours. You will kill me for the property. - Kill you! I will kill you! - Hey, you won't kill me in reality. Then? You will just put up an act. You will lie to the world. You will act, you will give a performance. You will get ready to be hanged. - Hanged! It won't happen in reality. You just will get prepared. I will run away from bombay. I can't even think of getting hanged. Chuttan! Chuttan! Chuttan! You will never be smart! Without listening you jump to conclusions. Listen to me. - Okay say. When the grave of my murder.. - Grave? Not grave you fool! Don't you find.. ..any difference between grave and news? News! News! - So then say news. Yes, when this news will spread, then.. ..father will come running.. and I would be lying down. After seeing me my father will fall down. If he fell on you then you will really die. No one falls on a dead body. And even when they fall they see and then fall. Understood? Now listen ahead. Father will cry and tell me, what happened my dead son. He will look at you and ask you what you did. You killed your own brother. Puttan, the plan is too good. But there is a problem in this. What is it? - People won't believe it. We both are very thick brothers. Ho will they agree that we fought over property. Chuttan! Should I tell you something? You have a point! - That is there. Now we need a witness. - One witness! Chuttan! - Puttan! They have come. - They have come. You want half the property! Take it! Take it! You are hitting your brother who is a God to you. You are no God, you are evil! You call me a demon? - You say. - You say. You say. - You say. Chuttan, what are the both of you doing? - Fighting. But why? - Because it is necessary. Father threw me out of the house by saying I'm not his son. But why did he throw you out? - For him. Leave me. - No. I am going to kill him. - Chuttan! If you kill me, then I will burry you. - Puttan, listen! Father wanted to give me half his property and he got jealous. Why shouldn't I get jealous? My blood started boiling. Who are you to take half of his property? I am the real son. I! What is this real and fake about? Your parents had adopted me when you weren't even born. When the property matters came in.. ..between, you started showing your true colors. I will show you now. - I will also show you now. I'll trample your head. I will drink the blood by crushing your bones. Get lost you broken drums! Puttan! Please, you have my promise. We will speak to uncle and get you your share. Leave me! - No, Puttan. Be calm tillw e speak to uncle. Agree to it Puttan! Puttan, what has happened to you? He is your brother. Wait! Wait! Go speak to uncle. I will be calm till then. Puttan, you have my promise! - Chuttan, you have my swear! Go! Rascal! - Scoundrel! Dog! - Mad man! Donkey! - Rascal! I am calling you an... - Owl! You are a foolish man. - You are foolish. Enough, the stock is over. Puttan, only a little of it has got over. Now we will star abusing with bigger words. No, these work only on the roads. Not in the censor. Puttan, I think we have fought enough. Now we should start killing. - Exactly. Take this blade. Think it is in your hand and kill me with it. But use the opposite side. Kill me! - Should I kill you? - I have died. If you are dead then why are you shouting? A dead man doesn't shout. He shouts before he dies. I will die for you. Now I will have to hide this dead body somewhere. I will pull you. - yes. Chuttan, will you really kill me? Puttan, there is blood coming from your nose. What? Did my nose get cut? It has gone higher. Yours and mine too. Put the blood on my jacket. Be quick. I will see how the world doesn't believe this. I will go to the city to give news now. Puttan, just disguise yourself and stay here. - Why? Till father doesn't believe you are dead.. ..till then no one should see you here. Or else, Puttan the plan will fail. - No. This plan won't fail. I will disguise myself so well that.. ..even mom won't be able to recognize me. I am there - You? - I got so scared. Puttan has been killed. - What? Tell me what happened? Say. What are seeing around like a thief? Chuttan! I am seeing like a killer, beloved. That's means you really killed him. I had put up an act for killing him, but he really got killed. What do you mean? I didn't want to kill him. But he had the blade in his hand. And my hand was on his wrist. And the blade was pointed at my chest. He was trying to put it in my chest. I was trying to avoid him There was push here and there. - Chuttan! And then he slipped.. I escaped.. he turned. And then I saw that he had stabbed himself in the stomach. It was 6 inches inside! - Oh no! Tell me beloved, what is my fault? I was saving myself for you. So that you should not become.. ..a widow before you even marry. But he killed himself, right? Yes, but I will be blamed for it. If you don't want me to get hanged.. ..then hide me for a few days. So, have you come to hide here? Yes, in your house, beloved. I have found out that your dad is not at home for a few days. But.. - No if's and but's beloved! One needs to be courageous in love! Be brave! After your dad is back, he will definitely.. ..think of some point to save me. First take this away from me. I get scared. What is this? Blood! - It is Puttan's. Hide this jacket some where. Come. You! - Yes, I am the real Sheikh. The one from Dubai. - Yes. The one from Dubai. I have drowned many people. And I have saved many people from drowning. I have understood. You all have only drowned.. ..the goods of our enemy. Your associates have come since a very long time. My associates? - Yes. Lets go. Lets go. Go straight and turn backside. Everybody is inside. - Everybody is inside! - Yes. Ok. Salutations! - Salutations! - Salutations! Sheikh Osman. Sheikh Abdul Rashid Batata. - Salutations! Sheikh Abrar Ali. Sheikh Abu Bakar, be cautious this time. Nothing should go wrong like before. You don't worry. Everything will be fine. This time we will send the golden biscuits in a helicopter ..which can land in a field as well as on a ground. You decide according to your convenience.. ..that where will the helicopter land? - Correct! Johnny. - Yes sir. - Mack. Let's go, Sheikh. I will show you. Yes, lets go. - Lets go. - Come on. This is Poha. A way goes to Jholapur from here. At 36 kilometers from Jholapur.. ..there is a village named Aastha. There is a plain ground. It will be perfect for the helicopter to land. Very well! Very well! You will hear the sound of the helicopter on 15th December.. ..then you will get the three signal of the flag.. ..on that ground only. What did you understand? Three signals of the flag. Sheikh, who among you all will bring the goods.. ..in the helicopter? Nobody will bring it. Nobody will bring it. Only the driver will be there. Only the driver will be there? But neither will he recognize us nor will we recognize him. Then how will he give the goods to us? You are being so silly. We do not carry on unauthorized business. This piece of paper will be the proof of goods received. You keep half of it with you. And the pilot will have the remaining part. The pilot will try to match both the torn parts of paper. Whoever will give this piece of paper will receive.. ..golden biscuits worth 5 crore rupees. Very good idea, Sheikh sir. Very good idea! Thank you! Thank you! The business deal is over. Now lets discuss something about entertainment. We have arranged many things for your entertainment. Come on. Cheers! "I have come for you and brought pleasure for you."

Have you known everything? - Not only me. All our friends know about it. Has everybody come to know? It has become famous in the city now. - What? That you have given shelter to Chuttan. Kanta. Look Kanta, I swear by you that.. ..he did not do anything purposely. He killed Puttan just to save his life. What? What did you say? Did Chuttan kill Puttan? O my God! Killed him! You only told me that you know everything. I did not know anything about the murder. I was just referring to your love affair. I am such a fool. I told you everything out of fear. I am dead now. You don't worry, Shaila. I will not tell anybody about it. I will not tell Poonam also. Hey! Don't tell her at all. She loves Puttan. Look Kanta, please keep this secret a secret only. Please. This secret will always be a secret. Kanta. Look Kanta, I beg of you. Please do not spread this issue. Otherwise.. Otherwise the police will come up till here. They will search my house. And then.. Then in my cupboard.. ..there is a jacket filled with Puttan's blood. If they will find that then we will be in danger. I will be dead. Look Kanta, please do not.. Don't worry. Kanta will not tell about it to anybody. This is a secret. Look, don't tell anyone. Fine. Fine. I will not tell anyone. Promise. - Promise. I will leave now. - Yes. Shaila. - What? Nothing. You do not worry. I will not tell anybody. Thank you, Kanta. - Yes, I will leave now. Kanta. - What? - Look, this is a secret. Don't tell anybody. Please. Don't you have faith in me? I will not tell anyone. I have faith on you. - Then I will not tell anyone. It may slip off your tongue. Be careful. I will not tell anybody. Chuttan has killed Puttan. Don't tell anybody. Chuttan has killed Puttan. Don't tell anybody. Chuttan has killed Puttan. Don't tell anybody. Chuttan has killed Puttan. Don't tell anybody. Chuttan has killed Puttan. Don't tell anybody. Chuttan has killed Puttan. Don't tell anybody. - No! What happened? Poonam, what is wrong with you? Murder, brother. My Puttan has been murdered. - What? Your Puttan? - I mean that the elder son of Diwan Bahadur. The younger one has killed him. I am unable to believe it, brother. What did you say, inspector sir? My younger son has killed the elder son. Don't you know about it until now? This news has spread like wild fire. - No. You don't trust this news at all. This is their new mischief. They do not find it appropriate if their father.. ..will sit quietly at home. You mean to say that this is not true. - Yes. Sir, today's letters. Charitra Kumar, he still wants to irritate his father. Salutations! How are you all? This is that man who had fooled us and come inside. All the forty thieves. You.. Are you their Ali Baba? Diwan Bahadur is sure that all these are just rumors. They are absolutely true, inspector sir. They are absolutely true. Who are you? - I? I am lawyer Vaidyanath's relative. Yes. What is the matter? Whatever you are saying, it is true. Look at this kite. - Kite. Chuttan has written a letter to Shaila. Lets go to Mahableshwar. It is a family fight. We will definitely take some decision. And the decisions have been taken. By sending the elder one to God's godown. The younger one is in our godown. - In your godown! Yes. And as soon as I got an opportunity.. ..I have got this jacket. This is the second proof. Fine, Hira. Take care of this. This jacket is the second proof. - Yes. This one. Does this jacket full of blood belong to Chuttan? The jacket belongs to Chuttan but the blood is not his. It is of somebody else. Tell me who are you? - No. Tell me? - No. Tell me. Open up! - No. I am not a CID officer. No! No! I swear by my father that I am not a CID officer. I will tell you. I will tell you. I will tell you. - Tell me. I am a CID. My father is a CID. My mother is a CID. My entire family is a CID. Open him up! Even the devil runs away from such being hit, Boss. Hey! You all just leave me once. I will run faster than a devil also. Tell me everything. Ali Baba, I do not understand that what should I tell you? I beg of you. I plead to you. Please do not hit me. After seeing these marks on my body, my mother will cry a lot. She will suffer a lot like a fish without water. Sir, he has started crying. He doesn't seem to be a CID officer. You! Come. Please come. You are inviting me inside. But your hands are.. Come. Please come. Come. Now even my hands are inviting you. Come. Definitely come inside. You can freely come inside. What is wrong in coming inside? Where is your godown? - What? Godown? - Yes. Look, you are a very good friend of my sister. That is why, I do not need to be strict with you. Please allow me to fulfill my duty. - Duty? - Yes. So.. So have you come to know about everything? Yes. - Trust me. Chuttan is not a murderer. Actually.. Actually, the murder took place unknowingly. Anyway.. Anyway, this is his first murder. And a first mistake is always forgiven, inspector sir. He will never commit this mistake once again. I take up this responsibility. You please do not bother. The law will take up the responsibility that.. ..he will not get an opportunity again.. ..to commit such a mistake. Please show me the godown. - Please inspector. I am asking you to show the godown. Come on. Chuttan! Chuttan! - Hey! Inspector sir, please come. Hey! If you had a desire to meet me.. ..then you should have sent a message. I would have come myself. - Stop kidding. Answer my questions properly. Sure. Sure, inspector sir. But why are you standing? Sit. Tell me that where is Puttan? - Puttan! Inspector sir, this Puttan is.. Now what do I tell you, inspector sir? This Puttan is very.. - Go ahead. Is he still alive? Even I was saying that only, inspector sir. This Puttan is.. Shaila, can't you see that inspector sir is here? Switch on the fan. Inspector sir, I start sweating when I see the police. But why are you sweating? Maybe due to the fire of anger within me. This knife.. - It was on the fan. On the fan. So you had hidden it over there. Is this the same knife with which you.. - Yes. Yes. Yes. Now tell me that where is that half torn piece of paper? Ali Baba, please do not get angry. I feel scared. I kept that half torn chit in the letter and.. ..enclosed it in an envelope and I had put it inside the postbox. I have explained the entire scheme to my younger brother. I have called him to Mahableshwar. All this is true. My time is up. I am leaving now. Hey! Tell me one more thing that what is the name.. ..and address of your younger brother? Hey! My younger brother's name is.. ..Charitra Kumar alias Chuttan. Care of Diwan Bahadur Atal Rai. Malabar hill, Bombay. Bye-bye. - Wait! My men will take you to Vaikunt.. ..with all the due respect. Are you in your senses or no? The name of our house is not Vaikunt. The name of our house is Gulistan. Gulistan! Gulistan! Graveyard.. Boss, he has fainted. Tie him to a heavy stone and drown him in the lake. Have you tied the stone tightly? Yes, I have tied it tightly. It will take him to the other bank within a moment. Not here. The water is deep over there. Come here. Come here. Come here. Hey! Lets go. My feet are burning. This year, there is lot of heat in Cochin. Hey, come here! - Yes. Please.. - What is the matter? Please call my Mani. - I will call him. Okay. Hey! Get down! Get down! How do you work? Mani! Mani, mother has come near the gate. She is calling you. Why is your mother calling me? Not mine but your mother. - My mother! Mother. - Mani. Mother. Mother. Why did you come, mother? You should have sent somebody else, isn't it? Whom? - Anybody else. Should I send Rukhmini? Hey! Why did you come over here? What? You just took my name. Who took your name, you witch? Am I a witch? You are a demon. I will hit you now. The more you are above the ground.. ..I will put you deep inside the ground. I will hit you.. - Mother! You stupid! Are you hitting an orphan girl? First get married to her and then fight with her. Rukhmini, you go to the market and rob the vegetables. Go. Come, my child. Come. Light the lamp. Light it. Why should I light the lamp, mother? Hey! Today is your birthday. Mother, then why should I burn the lamp? I will burn the matchstick, isn't it? Burn the matchstick and light the lamp. O my God! When will he get some sense? Light the second one also. Mother, why are you crying? Your son is not intelligent. That is why, you are crying, mother. No, son. However you are, you are very good. You are the light of my life. If I am the light then why are you crying? For my second son. This second lamp is for him. Today it is his birthday also. You both were born together, isn't it? Mother, it is fifteen to twenty years now.. ..that he has been separated from us. How many more years will you remember him, mother? I will remember him until I die, son. Please pray to God and ask him that wherever my son is.. ..he should be fine. Please pray. O my God! The lamp that we lighted for your brother has gone off. Subu is definitely in some danger. O sir! The corpse has been completely decayed. The fishes have eaten the corpse in such a manner.. ..that it is difficult for us to recognize the body now. Correct! But we can recognize the body.. ..through the watch and the jacket. You prepare the report. Hey, you fool! Why are you standing so dumb? Clear the suspicion of the inspector. Tell him where is Puttan hiding? Over there. - Where? On the rooftop? On the blue sky, father. - What do you mean? I have killed him. - Chuttan! Son, don't say it as a joke also. Inspector sir, please do not pay attention to whatever he says. Please close your ears. Why are you asking him to close his ears? Ask him to arrest him. What are you saying? - I am absolutely right. You have pampered them so much.. ..that they have started fooling with the law now. Inspector sir, take him with you. And if you will find the other one then arrest him also. The other one? - Yes. The other one. File a case of killing each other against them. These two fools must learn a lesson of playing such pranks. It is not a prank, father. This time I have really done it with a very strong reason. I have a reason for the murder. What is the reason? - Father's property. - What? What do you mean by my property? I mean that Puttan is an adopted son. I am the real son. But you have always considered both of us to be equal. Hey! Even you have considered him to be equal. You used to love him the most. Yes. I was not so smart until then, father. What are you saying? Yes. I have become smart day before yesterday. I am able to see property worth crores of rupees everywhere. Why will your adopted son become.. ..the owner of half your property? This means that for the sake of wealth.. ..you have become the enemy of your elder brother. He is not my brother, father. - How is he not your brother? I have never differentiated between the two of you. Hey! Please explain to him. - What do I explain to him? You are responsible for everything? - I? Yes, it's you. You. You. You. Hey! What is the use of earning so much wealth.. ..when it has become the reason for enmity between my kids? If you would just have a small shop.. ..then we all would live so happily. What rubbish is this? Mr. Chuttan, please come with me. Father, adopt a new son to take care of your property. I am going to hang myself. Don't say that, my son. Don't say that. Hey! Are you dead? Please say something. Hey! Shut up! My head is swirling. Inspector sir! Let this fool do anything. But a child is a child. Please come here. Just turn this case in such a way.. ..that Chuttan should be absolutely safe. What are you saying? I will give you any amount of money. - Diwan Bahadur! You should be ashamed of yourself. I don't take bribe. - You don't accept bribe! Amazing! What! Constable, take him away. Inspector sir, if not a bribe then at least.. ..for the sake of humanity. I will not be able to bear such a huge pain in this age. After my one son has gone, please do not.. ..take away the other son also. Save my son by any way. Hurrah! Triumph! Success! Victory! Puttan Sen has succeeded! Puttan Sen has succeeded! Hey! What are you doing? Mama, father has called me a son. What are you saying, you fool? Now don't call me a fool, father. If I would have been a fool then how could.. ..we prepare such a successful plan which has even fooled you? Isn't it, inspector sir? Inspector sir, father had thrown Puttan and me.. ..out of this house saying that we are not his sons. We both brothers decided that we would.. ..definitely make papa say that we are his sons. That is why, we planned all this. Hey! Puttan is alive. O my God! Ok. So you have even dragged the police in your plan. We did not drag the police. I was hiding in lawyer sir's godown. You came over there to get hold of me. I had told you before only that they both are evil creatures. But you did not believe me. Anyway, Mr. Diwan Bahadur, I spare them both.. ..with due respect to you. But once again if they will misbehave with the law.. ..then they will have to languish the punishment. Mr. Chuttan, if the murder has not taken place.. ..then from where has the blood come on your jacket? That was not the blood of murder but a small wound. In order to fool you all, I had applied it. - Really! I will inquire it with the Mahableshwar police. Go ahead. You have to hold her hand throughout your life. Why did you leave her hand out of fear? Mother, I did not leave her hand. She herself left my hand. Whenever you are not there then she holds my hand. And whenever you come, she leaves my hand. Rukhmini, you did not meet me since two days. Where were you? Hey! Are you deaf? Can't you hear her? Mother is asking you that you did not meet her since two days. Tell her. Give her an answer. I had gone to work in the field, mother. I pray to God that the crops this year will be very nice. Otherwise you will not get your two-time meal. - Mother! By eating food for one time, she looks like a brinjal. And if she will eat food for two times.. ..then she will look like a pumpkin. What did you say? Did you call me a pumpkin? If I am a pumpkin then why do you dance behind me.. ..like a monkey? Hey! Mind your language otherwise I will hit you. Mother! - First get married to her. Only then you will get the right to kill her. What did you say? Did you call me a monkey? Why did you call me a pumpkin? Whatever I would like to call you, I will say that. You will have to hear that. And if I will not hear it then? - I will hit you. - Mother! Do you scare me by calling my mother? You leave from here. - I will not go. You leave from here. Aren't you going? Aren't you going? Then come inside the hut. "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Whatever I did not want to do, I had to do that also in love." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Whatever I did not want to do, I had to do that also in love." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "You used to say that you would love me very much." "But you are scared from now only." "Hug me once then I will prove it. - Really!" "That the earth is above and the heaven is below." "Please be scared of the world." "But he doesn't listen to me. He is very ruthless." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Whatever I did not want to do, I had to do that also in love." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Your veil touches me and it completely drives me crazy." "I walk very waywardly. I may fall down." "O my dear, please hold me and walk." "I am waiting for you with my arms open." "And this lover is inviting you like a glass of wine." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Whatever I did not want to do, I had to do that also in love." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Whatever I did not want to do, I had to do that also in love." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." Young master! Young master! - Yes? Take his letter. - Who has given it? It has come for you, young master. I was cleaning the wastage basket in elder sir's room. I found it over there only. - Fine. Shri Charitra Kumar Chuttan. You? - Yes. My lover has come through the thin threads. This is known as the miracle of time. The power of love. Even my father is present in this house. - What? Double. My daddy and your father are.. ..sitting outside and speaking. Lawyer sir is also here! What is the matter? You are shocked. Did you get a criminal hanged? Brother, consider it to be shocking only. Under the penal code 302, a young man's corpse.. ..has been found in the Mahabaleshwar lake. It is absolutely decayed. Besides the clothes, it is very difficult to identify the body. Listen to me. You had sent the letter to Puttan, isn't it? - Yes. If he would have been alive then.. ..he should have come back by now. Look, it is a very important point. Don't get excited, my dear. He might have gone to roam about somewhere. Sir. Sir, the inspector sir is here. - Inspector sir! Look, be absolutely cautious. Think properly and then answer. He may trap you in his plan otherwise. This is a very crucial moment. - I request you to think. Please. Greetings, Mr. Diwan Bahadur! Come. Please come, inspector sir. Be seated. Tell me, how come you are here now? I have a problem. I was unable to solve it. - Tell me. Maybe you can help me out. - Sure. By the way, I am unable to recognize the watches. But you may definitely be able. - Absolutely. Your crucial time has come. Look at this. Omega C master. Why are you scratching my knees? Scratch yours. Inspector sir, the same.. Let me have a look at the number. Yes. It is the same number. I had brought this same watch for Puttan. Why are hesitating now? You were saying that my crucial time has come, right? Will I give a cheap watch to my own son? You will never give it. - Absolutely right, inspector sir. But how did you find this watch? Did that fool sell this watch to repay his debts? - Yes. Why are you saying yes? And he has even sold his clothes. You are continuously coughing. You are such a cheap doctor. Can't you take medicines for your cough? Look at this. This coat belongs to Puttan, isn't it? It surely belongs to Puttan. This means that fool has started selling his clothes also. Lawyer, he has insulted me. But you will definitely kill him. What rubbish are you saying? Mr. Diwan Bahadur, we have found this watch and coat.. ..from that corpse only which was found.. ..in the lake of Mahabaleshwar. Inspector sir, it might be found on any corpse. Any lake.. Corpse! Corpse! Wrong. Absolutely wrong! You come with me to Mahablaeshwar. I will prove to you that Puttan is alive. Whatever proof we wanted, we have found that. Now we don't need to go anywhere. Now lets go to the jail directly. Yes, one point inspector sir. Look, you cannot arrest him without a warrant. - Is it so? Do you have a warrant? - Yes. I have also brought a warrant. Take this, lawyer sir. I will present Puttan alive in front of you. You just give me a time of two days. You will not even get a time for one minute. Please let me go to Mahableshwar at least. - No. Son, tell me the truth? Is Puttan alive? Yes. He is absolutely alive. What did you do? Now the warrant is no more. So you cannot even arrest him. You are such a cheap lawyer. This inspector was quarrelling with me. And you just kept on coughing. Now how did you take out a point? You will come to know very soon. Mr. Diwan Bahadur, now I will arrest him.. ..by locking the handcuffs around his wrist. Inspector sir, will you arrest my son in front of me? Mr. Diwan Bahadur, gain your senses. - I am in my senses. Brother. Brother, leave him. - I will arrest you. How can you arrest me? I am warning you that don't force me to raise my hand. You have fooled me. Without my permission, you threatened.. ..my son in my house. - Let go of me. Constable! - Gardener! Secretary! Chef! Everybody come here. - Get hold of him. What do you mean by arrest me? Let go of me. I will.. - Shut up! Well done, son! Run away from here! Secretary, you help my son. - Chuttan! Chuttan! I am warning you, Diwan Bahadur let go of me. Puttn! Is your name only Chuttan? - Yes. Yes. Yes. I have to speak about a very important matter. With me? But the police are after me. That is why, we have come to save you. Come on, drive the car. Quickly. Yeah, right. The police trouble us a lot. Hey! This letter. I completely forgot about it. This is Puttan's letter. Hey, brother Chuttan! My brother Puttan has written that on the evening.. ..of 15th December, a helicopter will land in Aastha village. And listen to it ahead. Can you see this torn piece of paper? You would think that it is useless. Throw it away. You will say it, isn't it? You will say it, isn't it? Shankar, speed up the car. So that I can give him an answer. Brother, I am not in a hurry. You just listen to me. Listen to me. Do you know the price of this paper? 5 crores. In the form of gold. What is the matter, brother? Weren't you surprised to hear that? Very soon you will be surprised. - What do you mean? I mean that.. - Hey, you fatty! Why are you hitting me? Give that paper to me. Fine. As soon as you heard 5 crores.. ..your intentions have changed. Quietly give me the paper. - No. Won't you give it to me? - No. Is democracy not followed in this country anymore? Democracy is still in practice. You are not ruling us. But you have violated the law. That is why, you are imprisoned. Have you gone crazy? Which law have I violated? You have helped a criminal in escaping. You tore the warrant of arrest. And you stopped a police officer from fulfilling his duty. If I wouldn't have stopped you then.. would I hand him over to you? You were forcefully arresting my innocent son. Which father will not stop his son from being imprisoned? It is too much now, brother. It is enough Stop screaming and yelling like this. Stop it! Stop it! Then what should I start? Should I dance behind these bars? Should I start singing here? Should I celebrate here? There is a point. The time to celebrate has arrived. Listen to him. In speaking like a fool.. ..this lawyer is just like my sons. That is why, he has agreed to accept a fool as his son-in-law. Inspector sir, take this. Brother, you did not listen to my point properly. I had asked you to celebrate your freedom. I am coming here directly from court with the release order. Release order! - That was my release order. - Yes. Mr. Diwan Bahadur, please come out. - Come out. Come. I am sorry, brother. I called you a fool. I did not know that.. - Never mind! There is no need to be so happy. You are being released on bail. You have not been forgiven. Hey! You cannot harm me at all. Lawyer is with me. - Yes. Yes. Lets go. Listen to me, daughter. You love Puttan tremendously. Be firm on that. I will see that how anybody will stop your marriage with him? Listen to me, brother. To carry out this marriage, will you take.. ..the wedding procession to heaven? Hey! You are strange! I always believe that Puttan is alive. Even I have faith. Even my heart says that he is alive. Listen to me, sticks.. I mean to say girls. Proof it to me that what point do you have? We cannot prove it, daddy. But we have thought about a plan.. ..because of which Puttan will himself come in front of us. What? - What is the plan? - That advertisement. Loving son Puttan, your mother is very tense for you. Its wrong! The more I will plead in front of him.. ..he will trouble me even more. - You please read ahead. The person who will help this man reach.. ..the below written address, he will get a reward.. ..of twenty thousand rupees. Is it too much? - No. No. It is not too much for him. Diwan Bahadur Atal Rai, Malabar Hill, Bombay. How is the idea, uncle? Why, uncle? It is fine, isn't it? Well done! Hey! Wow! Wow! Wow! The entire army is sitting over here. Please say something. Or will you also not speak to me? Take your food. Are you getting angry? Fine. Don't get angry. I will give you food right now. Fine, take this. Hey! That's a good girl. First shake hands with me.

Almost half the sea. - Almost half the sea! Please take it back. I cannot turn the ship back now for you. Hey! What are you saying, sir? There is no traffic police over here. Please turn it back. - Have you gone mad? I am not mad. My name is Mani. I cannot stay without my mother, sir. I am already missing my mother. Mother! Mother! What is this, God? You gave me two sons. And you took away both of them. For which sin are you punishing me so much? Mother! Mother! Mother! Look at this. Look at this. See his photograph. Your son's photograph. They have even cut his hair. And they have even trimmed his moustache. Hey! Who has been so cruel to my son? Somebody in Bombay did that. Along with his photograph, there is an address also. Whatever's written in this paper I asked one man to read it. He told me that whoever will bring this man to Bombay.. ..they will give him a reward of twenty thousand rupees. For the greed of money, some rowdy goon.. ..took my son to Bombay. Rukhmini, my son might be in danger now. Come on, let us go to Bombay right now and search him. Yes mother, lets go. Hey! Have you come? Look, your food is also here. But I will not give it to you. If you want to eat this food.. Will you listen to me or no? Listen to me first. If you want to eat this food then.. ..you will have to do one work for me. You will have to open this door. I have tried a lot. But I am unable to open it. Now you think that how do you have to open it? Look over here. Go from here like this and then this is the door. Its latch is over here. Over here. Just open it like this. You open it and come inside. Come inside and then you can eat. Go. Go fast. Come fast. That's a good girl. Come dear. Come to me.

The toy which is hanging over there.. ..was also hanging on that car also. Let's follow them. Hurry up! Go faster, Shaila. Poonam, what shall we do now? - What should we do? Idea, let's go! Do they stay here? - Shaila.. - We were just enquiring.. What are Shaila and Poonam doing over here? Is this bungalow closed? - Yes, why? We want a bungalow in Mahabaleshpuram for lease. Why don't you show it to us from inside? This bungalow is not for lease. We liked this bungalow very much. Even if you don't give.. ..it for rest. You can at least show us. We will give you tips. Take this, 30 rupees. It seems that you are very interested in this bungalow. I guess I have to show you. You stay here. I will be back in a moment. Poonam, look at this. See, how my eye is shivering. Even my heart is beating fast. I think we are in danger. Let us leave this place. Sir, we are in Goa. - Yes. When will we leave? - After two days. What I'll do in 2 days, sir? Have you visited Goa, earlier? - No. Take this, 20 rupees and see Goa. - Ok, sir. Okay, sir. - Go.. Boss, look there and look here. The face is the same one, but the person isn't. It seems that he is from some village. Change his face and we can earn 20,000 rupees. You are right, Tony. Come with me. Greetings. - Son, haven't you recognized us? You are calling me, son? Please, come this way. - Why? Because I have money in this pocket.. ..and I am very apprehensive about you. How much money? - A lot of money. 20 rupees. Hey, God. Turn this 20 into 40. Now, look into your other pocket. O God. What is this! There is money in this pocket also. Now, I have a lot of money. - Hey, God. Turn 40 into 60. Now look into your other pocket. - This pocket? Yes. - O God. I have a lot of money now. I will sit somewhere and you take money out of my pockets. This is not possible, now. Our boss has the power to double the money. No. In fact our Guru has the power to create money. He can turn you 60 rupees into 6,000 rupees. - 6,000 rupees! Sir, then do it fast. I will go to my home and I will marry Rukmini. But that place is at a long distance. We have to go by train. - By the train? But don't worry. We will be back by tomorrow. I am not worried about that. Our ship will stay here for 2 days. Then, what are you worried about? You said that we'll have to go by train. Will you buy your own tickers? Yes, we will buy our tickets as well as your ticket. Then, let's go to the guru. Poonam, where will we search for him? Let's check that bungalow for one last time. You take the name of that place.. ..and my eye starts shivering. Don't take the name of that place. Then, where shall we go. - I don't know. Johnny, there are those girls. - I see. Greetings. I came to know that you were interested in our bungalow. Yes, we were. But we have found another bungalow. - Yes. But, you wanted to see our bungalow. Please, come with us and see that bungalow. Tomorrow, we will go there and see it by ourselves. Not tomorrow. Today. - Right now. Come with us. - Leave us. Help! What should we do now? - Let's run away. I am sorry. - Have you recognized me? I have seen you somewhere. You come into my arms and you will recognize me. You are a very foul person. With the help of these.. ..solid arms, I have beaten those villains away. I see. So, you are that person. We were so worried.. ..that we ran away, without even watching you. Now, look at me. What do you say? Mister, I don't like this kind of words. Wait, you don't like such words.. ..then let me start doing some deeds. Leave me. - No, I won't leave you. Don't worry. She is my body guard. Pyari, come here. What have you done? I see. So, it is you. Why are you in this disguise? So that the police couldn't recognize me. I am searching Kurtan in this disguise. Did you find him? - No. But I will search him in Astha. I guess I would find him there. - We too will accompany you. We have a car. - You have the car? Then, you drop me at Astha and you return to Bombay. Why? - This is a men's job. Ladies have got nothing to do in it. Listen to me. I have never seen two persons cutting a man's hair. Stop your laugh. Now, after changing your dress.. ..we'll take you to our guru. Do it, fast. - Now, get up. Boss, both look alike. - We got it. My head has become very light. You will feel it even lighter, when you will meet our guru. See yourself in the mirror. O God, you have cut my hair. You cut my moustache. Shut up! Come here. Uncle, I want to ask you something. - Yes, son. Ask me what it is? The same question which a hero asks the heroine.. ..when he gets out of coma. Where am I? You are nearby Kolhapur. - In our house. Aunty, question no. 2. How did I come here and who are you? We are the fishermen. My son brought you here, when you were unconscious. Unconscious! Now, I could remember it. Wali Baba's men were trying to kill me and I.. Wali, look at his smiling face. Don't waste time and tie the rope to his waist. Watch. Let me take it first. Give it to me. I will keep it with myself. Give it to me. - I won't give it to you. Give it to me. - I won't give it to you. Why are you shouting like the dogs? One takes a dead body with ease. - The dead man.. ..has started talking. - The dead man can even run. How can he? - Like this. For the first time I have seen someone dying. Aunty, I will indebted to you for rest of my life. I will come here some other time. Now I have to go to Bombay to my brother. But aunty.. - Yes. Are there my clothes with you or you have sold them? No. - They are here. Shut up. - Why are you crying? Tell me, what's the matter? You have asked me keep my mouth shut then.. ..how can I tell you. I have to open my mouth to speak. No problem. Tell me, why are you crying? I am not crying, but my stomach is crying. I am feeling very hungry. - Are you feeling hungry? Tony, get a Batata Wada for him at the next station. Yes, sir. - He is calling you sir. Have you taught him in the school? - He is my student. When did you turn into a barber from a teacher? You cut my hair. You cut my moustache. You are talking too much. I will bash you up. - Leave him, sir. Keep your mouth shut. - One moment you ask me.. ..to keep shut, and at the other you ask me to speak. I will definitely keep quiet until I get 6,000 rupees. One coke! Have a look at this! Now, look there. He is that person. There is a prize 20,000 rupees on his head. Brother, who are you? When you call me brother, why do you ask me, who I am? Where are you going? We will take to Bombay. If I'll go with you, I will reach Bombay in 6 months. We will take you on train, but you have to go with us. Why should I go with you? You will not listen to us in this way. - You have hit me. If I get angry, I will beat all of you. Help me. Police, help me. Help me. Inspector! Constable! - Shut up! Fire brigade.. Thank you, brother. You have torn it. What are you doing? You have already torn my pajama. Now what will you cut with that knife, my heart? Come with me. - Where? Come with me. - Ok, but please, get me new Lungi. What happened? Why are you crying? - I want to drink water. So, what is there to cry? Get down and drink water. Come on, go. Scoundrel is crying. Snacks. Snacks. Why are you taking me inside? What do you want? - Get lost. Seems like a pick pocket! - Where has he gone? Get into the line. You can drink water after I drink. You escaped from me. Come with me. Hey, leave me. I want to drink water. I am sorry. - The train is about to leave. Come inside. So what do you want me to do? Leave me, I have to go. Leave me, I have to go. Leave me. - Come with us. Hey, leave me. Mother! Mother! Puttan! Puttan. Puttan! Where were you? I am not Puttan. I am Mani. We got him. Come with us. I escaped the villains, and I got stuck with the vamps. Leave me. - Come with us. Boss give me one 'Biri'. Will you smoke 'Biri'?! Let me complete this job first, then I will give you.. Take this. You smoke. Even you smoke. You are holding from the front side. Why has this mouse turned into lion at once? Are you sure that you have given him just one Wada? He became powerful, with just one Wada. Hey, you chicken. Remove your legs from here. Do you think that we are your servants? Go away, for I will kick you. I hire people like you as my servants in my house. Please come. Boss, he changed his behavior as well as his language. I feel that something is wrong. This is yours. - Thank you. Now, check the tickets of these fools. Do you think that we travel without tickets? Here is the ticket. O no! Is the ticket with you? Have you lost your ticket? You have to go to the jail. We have lost the ticket. You are fooling me. I am a T.T. since many years.. I know people like you very well. - You are right. Get down. - Sir, but.. Get down. - We are getting down. You.. - Get lost you fool. Sir, take care of you cap. It comes down too many times. Brother, where is this address? - He is my son. Go and hire a taxi. He will take you to this place. Okay. - Come, let's go. Mother. - Rukmani. Mother. - Rukmani. Taxi, here. Where do you want to go? - Malabar Hills. I have searched you so much. I have searched you so much. I am tired of searching you. Till now, just men were after me. Now, the women.. ..have also started it. Now, the kids are left to do it. We will have the kids also. First of all marry me. Don't you have any shame! Leave me. What? Haven't you recognized me? You forgot me. Driver, hold his hand. - Leave me. Come with me. - Leave me. Leave my hand. Why do you want to take me to Cochin? Brothers, this lady is trying to molest a man in the daylight. He is my would-be. He is trying to abandon me. Why are you fighting with your wife? Take your wife with you. - Where? To Cochin. - Come with me to Cochin. Come on. - Leave me. What is this? You've dragged me from Kolhapur to Bombay. I haven't faced this kind of situation earlier. Stop playing. The whole family got into trouble.. ..because of your fun. - Leave me. Leave me. - Hey, come with me! Yours is a very big house. Whose house is this? Your dad's. Stop kidding, Chuttan. This is your house. Why are kidding with me? How can my house fly here from Cochin? Where are you going? - You are holding it like a mongoose. But I am sorry, but this hand of mine is not a snake. Mummy! - Stop. Why are you shouting? What is the matter.. It's you? Where were you? - I was in Cochin, sir. That's why you are like this trademark style. Chuttan's mother, please come here. Chuttan's mother! - Malti. Malti! - Why are you calling the elders with their names? Don't you have any shame! - I am just helping you. Sometimes I get angry at you and sometimes I love you. I will beat you later. Let me first hug you. You came here after so many days.. Mend your ways Puttan. - Not Puttan. I am Mani. Mani? - Yes. What is this new drama? You donkey! He came to me, hugged me.. ..and now, he is calling me donkey. Who is this old man? I will kick you. How dare you to behave with me like that? You fool. - Sir, Don't call me a fool. I am respectable person. What respect? Puttan, my son. Please don't call me, Puttan. You have made me suffer so much. Does anyone play with their patents like that! I am not playing with you, but you are playing with me. Everyone is hugging me, assuming me as their son. One person hugged me in Madras.. ..and picked my pocket. Have you stolen my money? What are saying? Your way of speaking has changed. A dog's tail will always be crooked. This donkey is not even accepting me as his father. I told you not to call me with names. I told you that I am a well respected person. Why is he speaking like that? What happened to him? Even we are unable to understand. He is pretending not to recognize us. His brother was saying that.. ..both of them have planned something. Planned something? - There is place called Astha.. ..nearby Kolhapur. They have planned something over there. Now, I got it. You have planned to trouble me. I know how to bring you to the normal state. Where is my stick? Wait! You want to beat my son in front of me? Will he beat me, now? - No, my son. No one will beat you. I got you. You want to take revenge with him. I will talk to him. - You better talk to him. You are better than these women in pants. You are just like my mother. - What? Mother, I am here. Where are you? Come inside. - Where are you dragging me? Leave me. I won't leave you. If I won't treat you, I'll change my name. Your name is Rukmani, but you are not halting. Why did you drag me from Mumbai? Because to punish you for you mistakes. Come inside. O my God. You height is this much.. ..but you have got lot of strength form the Cochin fish. Now tell me, why did you bring me to this hut? You have to say 'marry me' to me. - What? Egg, bitter gourd? No, not Egg, bitter gourd.. I mean you have to marry me. That means you are my love. You were my love, you are my love and you will be my love. When you said this kind of things in public.. ..it didn't matter. But if you say the same thing in this hut, I will shout. I won't mind even if you shout. The villagers will blame you for this. - Really! The villagers won't know anything about me. Does every lady of this village kidnap her husband? O God! What happened? He forgot his village. He forgot his language. He forgot everything. What happened to him? Why are you shouting? - I am not shouting. I am saying that what happened to you. Then, ask me what happened. A demon is dancing on my head, right now. What? - A demon. Demon! You called me a demon. You wait and see what I will do with you. I'll teach you a lesson now. You have to do what I say? And what if I don't do? - What if you don't do? The rope! - Yes, the rope. Now, get up. You called me a demon. Am I a demon! It is very hard to escape from the Cochin girls. I will tie your hands, legs and everything. Everything! And what will you do then? Then, I will lock the house. - And then.. And then, I will go away and leave you alone. Then, go away and leave me alone. What? You are angry at me. You want me to go away. I won't leave this place. O dear. O my love. My princess, I said you with love to leave this place. My pea-hen, my deer, please go away from here. O God. You killed me. You talked to me in this way, after such a long time. I won't leave you alone. You demon, leave this place. Whatever you say, I won't leave this place. You marry me. - O God! Please, kill me. You won't die alone. I will also die along with you. Please, kill me. Puttan. - Not Puttan, I am Mani. Now, look at the way he is sitting on the sofa. If I won't sit on the sofa, where would I sit? Dear, Come and sit on my head. Son, I have such high expectations from you. Tell me, that you would forgive me. You have started it again. You scoundrel, I beg in front of you. Please forgive me. Agree with me that you are my son. I am not your son. - My dear.. I am not your dear. That day he was angry when he said that you're not his son. He talks logically, only when he is angry. Ask him to be angry all the times. I am not your son. Are you my father? Have you married my mother? No, son. I will kick you.. Don't beat my son. Its better there isn't a son like him. He has ruined our lives. He is beating me and saying that I have ruined their lives. It's alright. I will bear it. I am a .. ..poor man and you're rich man. What nonsense are you talking? You are hurting us. You are hurting me ever more. My father used to beat me when I lied. But this person is beating me, when I am speaking truth. You are not eligible to be my father. - I will kick you. We have to take things easily. I guess he is in depression. He is a dumb. I guess someone has cast a spell on him. He is trying to fool us. - Dear. Wake up, son. If you are upset with him.. ..then why are you taking revenge with me. Please, have mercy on me. You are a very nice person. Please, don't cry. If you will cry, I will also cry. You, please don't cry. Then, you agree that you are my Puttan.. ..then I would get my son back. If I say that I am Puttan, would you get your son back. Yes, dear. - Then, I will say it just for once. Ok, dear. Say it, fast. - I am Puttan. Then, why were you playing with us for so long. You say it with love, first. And I show me your lovely laugh. You want to see my laugh. I've finished laughing. Now untie me. This is your laugh? So, you have also forgotten your laugh? Look at me. I will show you your laugh. Like this. - Yes. And you used to like it? - Yes, very much. Do you want me to make you remember something else? What's that? "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "The thing which I was not supposed to do." "I had to do those things also in love." Please sing dear. Hey, bitter gourd of Cochin.. I am not Mohammad Rafi's grandson. I don't know singing. What did you say? You won't sing? No. You forgot singing, laughing and everything. Mummy, he doesn't know anything. He forgot everything. Hey, open this rope. - No I won't. Open this rope. - No I won't. Good morning, Mr. Inspector. - Good morning. Did you get shocked to see Puttan? Inspector Madhusudhan Apte.. ..you have to cancel Puttan's warrant right now. Please, be seated. - Please. Let me make you a few things clear about this case. He wants to clear something. - Please, sit down Puttan. Sir, do you have a Lungi. - Lungi! Sir, this dress is very tight. You have started it again. Now, sit down. Sit down. What kind of language is this? I will say whatever I want. I will see how would you stop him from marrying your sister? Sir, mind you language. This is a police station. You mind you language. - Brother, please calm down. Mr. Inspector, please don't mind. He still has that day's effect. You handle the situation with a cool head. Mr. Puttan. Why aren't you speaking? You are speaking and I am listening. You are saying Puttan and I am listening to it. Even though it isn't your fault, there is someone's fault. Tell me, how could your coat and your watch.. ..were found on the dead body. What are you talking? My father never wore a coat, how could I wear a coat? What did you say, moron? - Keep your cool. You tell these wise persons, not to play with the law. This is not a simple case. He can be convicted ..of the murder on the basis of the coat and the watch. Do you want me to tell why you are convicting him.. ..of the murder. Because you are the murderer. He was the dead body till yesterday.. ..and now, you made him the murderer. Now, I doubt your mental state. I think you should visit.. ..the hospital for the mentally handicapped people. Sir, you go to that hospital.. ..but take him person along with you. Now, you will know where I will take you. Constable! Why don't you send me to Cochin? Who is there in Cochin? My mother is in Cochin. Oh God, my hand. Brother! Come here. - What? I haven't read the paper since many days. Will you give me that paper to read? What? 12th December! There are only three days left for the helicopter to land. The Puttan must be alone over there. How could I escape from this demon! "Beloved, kiss me.." "Beloved, kiss me.." "The thing which I was not supposed to do." "I had to do those things also in love." Did you get back you memory? Yes, I got back everything. You are even talking properly. "Beloved, kiss me.." "The thing which I was not supposed to do." "I had to do those things also in love." "Beloved, kiss me.." Why are you crying? I am crying because, in this paper it is written that.. What is written in that? - That my mother is searching for me. And she collided with a Plane at Bhendi Market.. ..and broke her leg. She broke the leg of the Bhendi Market Plane. No, my mother broke her own leg. Mother! - Don't cry. She is in the J.J hospital. I will bring her from there. - No, I will come with you. Why? I will come be with you, wherever you go. That means you came here with you daughter-in-law.. ..in search of your son. Yes, now even my daughter-in-law is lost. - Mother! This is my son's voice. Mani, where are you? Mummy, I am here in the prison. Mani! My son. - Mother! Hey, lady. Where are you going? He is Mr. Diwan Bahadur's son. Don't take away my son from me. I can't recognize my son? Mother! - Mani. Leave my mother. O Mother! My son. Hira, what is going on? - Nothing, sir. She is saying that Mr. Diwan Bahadur's son is her son. What? He is your son? Yes, sir. He is my son. You mean to say that you are his mother? Or can she be your mother? She is my mother. Yes. He is really my son. Leave him, he is a good boy. I will take him away with me to Cochin. Okay fine. Where are you going? - To drink water. Water. Wait here, I will bring it. Stop! Where are you running leaving me behind? Where are you running? Wait! Drive fast. She is the woman who says that Puttan is her son. And Puttan also says that she is her mother. You can't solve this puzzle, inspector. I guess I can solve this puzzle. Do you have only one son? I have two sons. Both look similar. - Are they twins? Yes. One is Mani, who is inside the Jail. And the other one was lost in the carnival. Where was he lost? - In Allahabad. In the Kumbh Carnival. - Yes. How did you know it? - Was it 22 years ago? How did you know it? - How did you know it? Wait. I am worried that the body.. ..which they got from the lake was of Puttan's. No uncle, this is not possible. They may have got stuck in Astha. Uncle, let's go and see. - Yes, let's go. They know about my other son. Where did they go? - My sister Poonam might know it. Chuttan! - Puttan! Pleased to meet you. Brother, remove your clothes. Where did you go away, leaving me alone? You got me killed. Come on, sit inside. Someone is driving away the car. Let me go. Johnny, you follow the van. Captain, someone is driving away our gold in the van. Please help, captain. Talk to me with love. You are beating my boyfriend! Go away. You are beating me. - Forgive me. Forgive me. No, I am not your boyfriend. Uncle. Puttan is also there. Come, let's go. Come, this old man will give you bash. Kill him. Father. Go, catch him. Chuttan, they are running away. Let's chase them. What? In the blue van! On the Bombay road! Ok. Mr. Inspector, this is smuggler's gang and.. ..this is their group. - There is also gold worth 5 crores. Don't move. Chuttan. - Congrats Mr. Diwan Bahadur.. ..your sons have done a great job. They were born to do great things. And the government will give 10%, i.e. 50 lakhs.. ..to them as a reward. Who is Subbu and who is Mani? I am unable to recognize them.. ..in spite of being their mother. But both are my sons. Mother, I don't need two. One is sufficient for me. Who is my son? - You find it by yourself. I'll tell you. This is Puttan. My son. Shut up! Wait, I will use my law points here and the find Puttan. This is not your court. Mr. Diwan, if you wish I would take them to Police station.. This is not the police's job. - I will find it out. Tell me, or else I will take off your Lungi. So, this is a conspiracy of both of you. You will not listen to me like this. I have to bash you up. Where is my stick? There it is. Puttan, my son.
