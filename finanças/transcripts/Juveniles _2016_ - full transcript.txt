Hey. Do me a favor. Hold this for me. And don't lose it. Memory is a motherfucker. The good ones fade away. The bad ones... Lot's been going around here. ...play over and over forever. Now, Russell and Ben have decided to settle things man to man. - No one interferes. - It's how we evolved. No one talks about it afterwards. None of it. Ever. If you forget something dangerous, history repeats itself. Go to it. Over and over forever. Are you following this, little man? Your daddy hits hard. He's smart. Don't let emotions eat him up. Don't ever fight for show. If you got to fight, you fight to end it. Fuck. Come on. Get him. - Oh, shit. - Russell. Russell. Are you following this, little man? Hold this for me. My god, please. Hold this for me. God! Hey! Hey. Curtis. Corie. What's your story, Corie? You live here? Yeah. Is that your bedroom right there? Yeah, over here. - Lucky Charms? - Yeah. We got to go. Button your shirt. You got any coffee? My mom's shit is in the top shelf. Don't touch anything else. You ready to go? No. Trent! Trent! Hold on. We can go. Just a serious question. Jacket, no jacket? Jacket, no jacket? I can take the jacket off if doesn't look good, that's all I'm saying. Keep the jacket on. Fuck, man. I don't see you'll with my... Motherfucker. Can you get this fixed? Why is this... Abandon hope, all who enter here. In the deeper levels he encountered both wrath and sullenness. Wrath he discovered is the anger that is expressed. And sullenness, the anger that is repressed. Who can tell me who he first found when he reached the gates themselves? It was a group of people defined by what? Amber? Seriously? Trent? Oh, shit. Sorry. My bad. First people he found were the ones who wasted their lives. Close enough. Lucas, stay a minute. Bye. See you later. You've been missing a lot of school lately. Did you hear back from any colleges yet? No. It takes time. You know, just keep your grades up. Yup. How far do you live from school? I'm in the hills. Oh. That's fancy. Not those hills. You know the big farm off the highway? The one that looks like a city. Yeah. I live 20 miles up from there by the ranch. No one gives a shit about anymore. The pit? - Is that what... - Yeah. - I'm opening up a study hour after sixth period. - I have work. Okay. Your work counts here, too. So, we about to buy some weed yesterday, right? Andy is wearing the same fucking hoodie he wears everyday, forgets the money he owes. - You guys got anything? - Again. So, Elliot pulls out his gun and he's like, business is business. You know my family don't fuck around. The normal Elliot shit. And then boom. Smack... Smacks him in the mouth with the barrel of his gun. His lip turned into a... I know don't know, what do you call this? Why you still doing business with them? Why? Because I smoke. I just smoked a J in the bathroom. I'm feeling amazing. You don't get involved with them. These fries tastes like Jesus. Trying to get to a dollar. I just want to get tips. Yo, yo, what's good? God damn, don't ever smile at me again. - What's up, buddy? How you doing? - Hey. Lucas. You got two bucks I can borrow? - You still owe me five. - Yeah, you do owe him five dollars. I know, man. Come on, dude. - I'm hungry. - We're all fucking hungry. We're all hungry and I'm high which means I'm even more hungry. What did you do with the money I gave you? Lucas, you think you can get me a job at the farm? It's not a good time. Come on, man. You got Trent a job. We barely hang on. Trust me. Dude. You don't want to work there. Place is like hell. Either way he's fucked. He owes. I'll see what I can do. Seriously, those two again. Your sister is so stupid. What the fuck is my sister doing? What the fuck is he saying? You don't fuck with that family. Whatever you're going to do, I got your back, just, good luck. Okay, let's do it. Come on. You're out there causing all sorts of trouble, jailbait. What the fuck's going on? Oh! Hey, what's up, Lucas? Go catch up with your girlfriend. - Go. - Don't treat me like a fucking kid. What's up with you and my sister, huh? Nothing, we're just talking. She's 14. Mmm-hmm. You touch her and I'll have you arrested for statutory rape. I'm sorry. - Is that funny? - Did you hear that? Arrested? Let me let you in on a secret. Sucking ain't fucking. Fight! You fucked up now, Lucas! Hey, fucking security. Hey, it's all good, bro. It's all good. We'll settle this back home. We go to school, and town, where there are things like security guards and the occasional cop. Then, it's a long drive home to another world. We got one road in and out. The mailman drops our shit in a crate by the highway. See, we can't afford to pay taxes. Our votes don't matter. So, the outside world doesn't give a shit about us. People die, no one cares. I ain't see a cop here since I was a kid. That might've just been my imagination. Motherfucker. - Hey, go inside, baby. - Who is that? Just get inside. You know my sons? Junior. Elliot. What do you want? You owe. This is my home. You want to talk business, you call me, then we'll meet, somewhere else. Yeah, we tried that. You're selling our shit, but you're not paying. Listen, bitch, you'll get yours. Now, go, go. You don't have it right now? - No. - You ain't got shit in this ghetto half stack? Motherfucker, you didn't hear me? I said no. Heard you won a fight last week. Straight up. First round knockout. Nice. Get inside and take everything. - No, no. - Make her watch. No! You know this is what happens if you didn't pay. I can feel the weight Yeah, I can feel the weight Of the world Woah I can feel the pressure Yeah I know the pain and the hurt Oh! I've been climbing up All these mountains for so long And I've been building up All these kingdoms For so long I will not run When destiny calls I'm dipping my hand in gold It's good to be king It's good to be king Ay. Ay, ay... My mama used to name our plants. We had a Walter and a Charlie and a Sprout. Sprout didn't make it. Where are you going to hang yours? I don't know. Well, you should name it first. I think even plants know you love them when you give them a good name. Your daddy named you. Before we knew we were having a girl. That is why you got a boys name. - Hey, Lukey. - Hey, ma. - More Elkhorns? - More Elkhorns. Mom, why are you spending money on plants? They were on sale. They're just like the ones that my mommy used to hang when I was a kid. - We can't afford anything. - Ain't that sweet. Oh, come on. They didn't cost nothing. Well, nothing costs nothing. Take them back. I think they look nice and I think they make the place look nice. Fine. Fine. I don't care. They'll take them back. I don't care. I'll get those ten dollars back. - Mom, stop. - I'll take them back tomorrow - after work. - Stop, stop. I'll get all the money back, it's fine. - Give me that one... - Stop. - Stop, it's okay. - No. Listen, I understand that I... I'll hang the plants. Okay? Give me the plant. Come on. - I'll hang the plant. - Well, use the plant I got for you. Fucking hang... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to swear. Okay. I love those. They remind me of my childhood. I don't know. What can I say? Yeah. Oh, no. Charolette. Ma. Hey, sexy. You ready to go? I don't even know what time it is. - I'm sorry. I haven't even showered yet, let me just... - Chop, chop. I won't take a minute. Hey, Lucas. So, when are you going to set me up with one of your friends? Going into town tonight? Yeah. You two be okay? Yeah. Corie, do the dishes. I'm not going to ask you again. What is this? Whatever shit you got going on with Elliot it's going to end. He's nice. You're just jealous. Yeah, of what? He's more popular than you. He's on the football team. He gets more girls. He's a drug dealer. Did you know he pulled the gun on Trent last week? Guns are cool. Trent probably deserved it. Easy with that. Those dad's? I don't know. You know the story behind this glass? No. When dad used to come home from work everyday in that beat up truck., me and mom would hear him and run to the door. We were waiting for him. And she'd have this glass filled with... cinnamon whiskey. He loved it. And we'd just sit on the couch and tell us about his day. I wish he was here. Do your homework. Ugh. Shut the fuck up! Disgusting. I'm in the next room! That was fun. Lucas? Motherfucker! Boy. Chill out, man. Elliot. - Corie, get inside. - I got the whole family here, huh? What did you do to our house? Corie, get inside! Listen to your brother, baby. It's got nothing to do with you. Come on, it ain't so easy, when you haven't done it before, is it? Come on, boy! Do it! I mean, how many guns you got in there, Lucas? Cause I got a whole bunch of toys. Own, baby. Get in your fucking shit ass trailer. You're fucking trailer trash. Hey, Mom. Hey, Mom. I thought you were a tramp. Fuck you. We may not have much around here, but at least we have a code. When two of us get to having a disagreement, we meet and hash it out. We don't need cops, or lawyers, shit like that. We finish what we start. No one else ever needs to know. What the fuck you want? I want to see your pops. You packing? Dad, someone here to see you. What do you want, Lucas? I'm having a disagreement with your son. Elliot. - What? - Get out here. What the fuck are you doing here, Lucas? You threatened my family. I want to sort this shit out before anyone gets hurt. It's a little late for that. Man to man. So, you want to go to the ranch and settle this? Yeah. Or you two could quit eye fucking each other and get a room. Get inside, Junior. Whatever. Fine. - Oh, shit... - shut up. Get back to what you were doing. How you doing for money? I'm fine. You know, there's always some work here if you want it. We could do with someone with a good head on their shoulders. I'm good. When you see Elliot next, you can talk to him and you can work out your little play date. He's gone. You've heard of the three strike rule, haven't you, Andy? I'll get you your money back. I promise. We have been so lenient. Haven't we, son? I'm sorry. We told you what would happen if you didn't pay us what you owed. It's all right. It's okay. I need to take a piss. Elliot. No. Fucking bitch. Come on, let's go. Come on! Let's go! You want to go? I'm going to fuck you up. Let's go! Come on here, you bitch. - Mom home yet? - Nope. Watch out. Watch out. Nice catch. You smell like a pig's ass. Fuck off. I thought you were quitting. I work on the farm. They give us free food. Fuck those assholes, I'm not eating it. It's more for me. Quit the construction site? No. So, you're working for the assholes that stole all our jobs and then you're building houses for them. Paid for that candy bar. So, you and Elliot, huh? How do you know about that? He's saying he's going to kill you. Good. How's that good? He's talking shit means he's scared. You gonna win? I'm going to rip his fucking throat out. And all this bullshit is over. You know why we're doing this, right? I've got to do everything I can to keep you and mom safe. You got to help me, too. Close your eyes. Why? Just do it. Okay. Dad's ring. Don't lose it. - Will you do it? - Okay. Got it. Good? Yeah, it looks good. Really good. Can I show you something? Sure. Well, you got to promise not to tell anyone. - Yeah? - Yeah. College boy! Just look at this place. I knew you'd get in. Oh, it ain't like this shit, I want to tell you that much. We're all going to go here. You, me, mom. I'm gonna get that degree. Get a job. And then we're just gone. We just got to make it through this year. All right, round up, children. Lucas and Elliot have been having some problems. Yeah. I found that under your fucking pillow. You might be glad it's under there one day. They're here today to hash this shit out man to man, so, we all don't end up killing each other. - Jesus, mom! - You think I don't know what's going on? I know what you're doing. You're not going anywhere today. And no matter what happens, nobody interferes. Listen to me. You think you can just go out and have your fun, - be a man and who cares what happens. - I can't fucking talk to you right now! You leave people behind. You ready to fight? - How about you? - No. You step one foot outside this house - don't even think about... - Why don't you fucking stop me? What are you going to do? You want to keep us safe? Take that shit out of the trash and learn how to use it. You're just like your daddy. Let's get to it. If you walk out that door, you keep walking! Get the fuck out of my house! We'll be just fine without you. Fuck! God damn, pussy fight. - Fucking get him! - Get in there! - Maybe you should've. - Come on. - Watch the left! - Come on, let's go. Hey, Elliot, deck his face. - You got this, baby. - Turn around. Come on. Come on. Come on and finish it. I got one bullet for your mom. I got one too for that little bitch sister of yours. I got one more for you. Elliot, use your elbows, man. Get him off you, man. Get him off you. - Stay focused. - Get up... No, no. Come on. Get up. - Get off of him, man. - Get off him. - Fuck this... - Shut the fuck up. Enough! He can handle it. Stop. Stop! Elliot! Move! Hold it. Come on, fucking kill him. No, stop. Lucas, stop. Fucking get a room. Lights out, baby. Hey, you're fucking killing him, Lucas. Elliot, come on. Champion finds a way. Find a fucking way. I swear to god, get up. Come on, baby, come on. - Dude, bite his nose off or something. - Elliot! It ain't so easy when you haven't done it before, is it? You got to get up, man. Elliot, wake up. I'm sorry. No! Pull the trigger man. It's all you got to do. Step up, be a man. Come on. Come on. Come on, boy. Do it! Tomorrow we'll still be here. We're going to have our differences, sure. But this shit is settled. Go tell my mum everything's okay. Never to be talked about again. All right. What the fuck? Get in the fucking car, Junior. Get in the fucking car. Fucking get up and you get in the fucking car. Get up! Get up! He won. He kicked his fucking ass. You should've been there. It never ends well, you know. Seasons pass, we don't talk about what comes before. We bottle it up and let it fade away like ghosts. We keep our heads down, keep working, stay together. Maybe, in time it could all be different. What time do you get off tonight? Late. I thought maybe I could come by, and say hi. I got to watch the miles, you know. Cash is up again. I'll see you after? All right, sure. Did you bring your lunch today? I'm not hungry. Anyway, I'm on a diet. I'm getting fat. It's on me. Okay? Spend it on food. Not scratchers or smokes or whatever you buy. Hey, Luc, you got a couple bucks I can borrow? We are in the middle of something. Do you have a couple of bucks that I can borrow? What happened to your pay? I got to give a couple of bucks to my pops and my uncle out of town and shit. Whatever. It's not like they pay shit anyway, right? I just want to get something to eat. I'll take it out of my next week's check, if you want. Lucas. Can I speak with you? - Yeah. - Wait, bro, I need something to eat before we go to work. I'm going to pass out again. Remember? We'll get something on the way. You're not hearing me. Can you wait? What? I've got something I've been getting, okay? Like every fucking day, right? It's like food, my usual shit. And... I was buying some stuff and I kept buying like more stuff and... I'm just... I owe. Okay. I owe Elliot, which means I fucking own Ben. - I told you... - I fucking lied, man. I told you not to get involved with them. Listen to me, I need this fucking money, bro. I'm sorry. I promise I will pay you back. Lucas! - I will fucking pay... - Get your fucking hands off me. - You think you're high and mighty. - Fucking stop... - That was an accident. - Fuck. Come with me. - Lucas, I... - Stay! Fuck! Okay, um... I made sense of some of the financial aid forms for you. I know they can be kind of... Kind of confusing. There's a couple of places where you have to sign. I marked those. There, and then... you just got to look through it and make sure everything is accurate. I got into a pretty nice college too. But... I made some bad mistakes and it all just slipped away. Just like that. Now, I'm stuck here. Your friends don't know what's good for you. What do you mean people aren't paying? Times are tough, I guess. When I was your age, I had twice the responsibility and my daddy didn't give me a fucking dime! I'll give you 16 dimes and a shotgun show. What? Nothing. People pay you out of fear and respect. You don't have any. Yeah? What the fuck am I supposed to do then? - Earn your keep. - How? How? What do I always say to you? Right. "A champion finds a way." What did you fucking say? A champion finds a way. Don't you fucking mouth off. What do I tell you? A champion finds a way. Say it again. A champion finds a way. Again. A champion finds a way. - Again. - A champion finds a way. - A champion finds a way. - Come on. Say it again. - A champion finds a way. - Again. - A champion finds a way. - Again, you motherfucker. - A champion finds a way. - Again. A champion finds a way. Hit me again. A champion finds a way. Hit me again. A champion finds a way. A champion finds a way! Get the fuck off me! A champion finds a way! There, there, that's my boy. That's my boy. All right, all right. All right. Get the fuck out of here. Hmm. Don't play with your food. - How do you like it? - All right, kids, - That's what you get. - I'm heading into town. What is this? Oh, hey, Amber. - You want something to eat? - No, thanks, honey. I'll just grab something on the way out. You'll clean this up, right? Okay, well, y'all have a good night. Hey, finish that and put it in the sink. Put that in the sink too. I'm bored. Come here, baby. - Jesus Christ, babe. - Come here. Hey, I got to study. Fuck. Hey. Are you fucking kidding me? Babe... What the fuck? Are fucking into me or what? Of course, I am. But I have to study. Hey, stop. I got to fucking do this, okay? Are you going to marry me? What? Are you going to marry me? We haven't even graduated yet. Just answer the fucking question. - Baby, why you... - Are you going to marry me, Lucas? This is fucking stupid. It's not fucking stupid. Shut the... - Please, stop. - Fuck you. You fucking ignore me... You know what. You're probably just planning to go to college and find some rich fucking bitch and fuck her and leave me behind. That's what you're planning on doing, isn't it, huh? - Like fucking, Miss Taylor. That teacher. - Stop! - You fucking stop. - Look at me and stop. Crazy bitch. We'll talk about this tomorrow. No, we will talk about it now. Fuck you! Take her out. You going to hit me, Lucas? Just stop! You're acting fucking crazy! God! I can't get a fucking break in this house. Oh, that's not crazy baby. This is fucking crazy. And this, and this, you know what? - This is fucking crazy, Lucas. - Stop! This is fucking crazy. - Stop! - I fucking hate you. Get her ass out. Get the fuck out! You fucking little cunt! - Baby, come on. No. - Go home! Lucas, open this door right now! Come on, baby. Come on, just let me back in, okay, baby? You know I'm going to be real good a quiet. You better open up this door, bro. You better open up this door or I'm going to break it down and fuck you up. You do not want to fuck with me! Fuck! You ungrateful piece of shit. Do you know how many guys want this? - She's crazy. - Fucking trailer trash. Fuck! It's okay. Jesus fucking Christ. Fucking bitch. Fucking cunt. Shut the fuck up, you little tiny bitch. You want to fuck with me? You tiny little... Knock that shit off. - Corie, inside. - What the fuck are you doing? - Lucas! - Go home. Lucas, stop it, what is wrong with you? We'll talk about it tomorrow. - Lucas... - We'll talk about it tomorrow. I love you, baby. Jesus Christ, Corie. I love you, baby. Damn. Thanks for the help, asshole. All right. Collection day. Fuck, good to see you, man. Look, I've got the money, all right? Two fucking days and it's here. You got to pay what you owe, Trent. That's the rule. Or you can come back to our house for a conversation. It's on its way, man. It's on its way. Where's my fucking money? Where's my money? Hey, bitch, you fucking hear me. Where is it? Where the fuck is my money? Hey! Hey, how much does he owe? What the fuck do you want, college boy? - How much? - How much you got? He's square, right? Shit, I don't know. - He's square. - Yeah. He's square. You are lucky your boyfriend came. You say hi to your mom from me. It's been a while. Come on. Come on. We've got six more stops to make. You okay? Hey, I'll pay you back. Get in the house. Get in the house. Mom. What the hell is wrong? Lucas, she's doing it again. What happened? She can't breathe. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. Why'd you get like this? Promise me you will never talk to those people again, okay? Okay. Oh, God. Come here. It's okay. Don't you ever cross that man. He's no good. He'll come for all of us. What are you talking about, mom? Corie, stay inside till I get back. I'm supposed to be somewhere. Don't argue with me. Stay! I'm not your fucking dog. Lucas. Shit. You're getting tall. Can I talk to you? This is my friend. - What's up, man? - How you doing? I've been solid. All right. - You sure? - Yeah. How you doing? Well, I'm all right. You know why our hands evolved from monkeys? To use tools. No, everybody thinks that. Tools, beating hands with sticks and making shit. If that hand had tools, well, it'd be thinner. They'd move better. But our hands are like this because they did one thing. Our fingers curl and out thumb backs it up. Our hands evolved because the strong survive. Is that a 50 CAL? That's what that is. Where the hell did you get it then? Well, I know a guy. You want a beer? No, I'm fine. - Sure? - Mmm-hmm. Don't mind if I do. Went hunting two days ago, shot that buck right there from 100 yards, right between the eyes. Clean kill. No pain. With the 50? With the 50? With the fucking 50? No, not with the fucking 50. If I shot that buck with the 50, his brains would be out of his asshole. No. What... What happened that day? What day? Oh, shit. Hey, Lucas, you know, we... We don't talk about that. Why did my dad get into it with Ben? They were drunk. They had themselves a little dance, that's about it. You know, alcohol reduces the physiological stress response. That's why I don't drink... Oliver. It's not his fault he doesn't want to talk about it. It's how we keep the peace. But it's been the same bullshit my whole life. No answers. No closure. The past is just gone. Shut the fuck up! My mum is a fucking wreck. She won't fucking say one word to me. She was a wreck before the fight. I remember. Corie's getting mixed up with them too. You keep her away from them. Well, I can't protect my family if I don't now what really happened. Oh, fuck. All right. If I tell you this... ...you can't ever act on it. What's done is done. And you deserve to know, I agree. I've... I wanted to tell you for years. But if you ever act on this there won't be no turning back. Okay. Oh, I don't know why she left. But, fuck her. Two kids? She leaves behind two kids. Come on, Ben here ain't exactly a picnic to be around. No woman in her right mind is going to do that. We are going to find someone for you. I am a matchmaker. I love setting people up. And I know you. I see you acting all tough and mean all the time, but, I know deep down, you're a little old softy. Don't get any big ideas there, bubba. Come on, let your girl have a little fun for once, huh? Yeah. Oh, hell. She gets to have all the fun she wants. Ain't that right, baby? Ben, on the other hand, doesn't know the meaning of the word. That's why no one likes you. Ain't that right? Stop being an asshole. Oh, shit, you hear that, Oliver? - I'm the asshole? - Uh-huh. We were all friends growing up. We're going to find you someone. And Ben wasn't like he is now. He and your folks though, they had issues going way back. Wrong ideas. And you know how it gets around here. We're going to find you someone. We're going to go into town... Sometimes people just... - We're going to get a real good girl... - Snap. Just someone to knock some sense in that mean head of yours. Whoa, easy there, tiger. Um... I think you got the wrong idea there. I don't think I do. Oh, let's talk about this later. No, let's talk about it now. - Hey. - Get off of me. - Stop, that's enough. - Hey! That was a bad night. And then some... Some other stuff happened. But that was about it. What happened? Nothing. Oliver. Fucking watch. Watch! You fucking wanted this. No! You wanted to know. Now, you know. The next day, people started shooting. People died. The whole town turned into a war zone. Your daddy, he called Ben out and said, "No one else needs to get hurt." He said, they should settle things man to man. You were there for that part. I mean, your mum wanted to let it go. She was the one that wanted to keep it quiet. Didn't want you or Corie to ever know about it. Your dad was the one who insisted on you being there that day. He wanted you to understand what it was he was doing. You got to be man enough to let this go. Lucas, your... Hey, where we going? We're going to Ben's. If you don't want to come with me, man, you don't have to. No, I got you. Let's get it. What the fuck? Drop punches. All right, look, hang on. Let me help you. All right, jailbait. - Come here. Alright. So... - Okay. Boom! - Just like that. - How do these two keep ending up together? Whatever shit you got going on with Elliot - it's got to end. - He's nice. This hand, you're just throwing it out there, okay? What's up with you and my sister, huh? You fucking some dumb bitch with your sister in the next room? You think she doesn't tell me about that? Can you show me how to throw a real punch? When you grow up a little bit. See, this is how you win fights. You just keep... You got something set up and you just find a way to win the fight. You know, a champion finds a way. Oh, yes. Again. Yes. Again. Ah! The boy's lit up. You see this. Look at this. You cut him open. What are you doing? - Just smoking. - Are you fucking high? No. Dude, you're supposed to be on watch. What are you doing getting stoned right now? Quit looking at me. Back to back. Hey! Oh, shit. - What are you doing here? - Hey. - What are you fucking doing here? - You need to home, man. Corie, get in the fucking truck. Why don't you get back home? Corie, get in the fucking truck. - Hey, hey. - What do you want? Look, she's a grown ass woman, okay? She can do whatever she wants. Hey, are you deaf, huh? She said, "go home." Get the fuck... Get to fucking walking. Get to fucking walking, Corie. Go. Lucas! Lucas? - Lucas? - Come on. Hey, Corie, he's fine. Corie, look at me. Hey. - Lucas? - Your brother's fine, okay? He's gone for a little nap. He's fine. Let's go. Come on. Hey, Elliot. Lucas. Corie! No, no. Corie, everything's going to be okay. Trent, get the truck! No, no! No! I'm so sorry. Fill this bag with as much of my mom's shit as you can in two minutes. Put it in the truck and start the engine. We got to go. I'm not leaving until we bury her. Oh god. Listen to me. Look at me. Look at me. Ben is going to come here and he's going to kill us. I told you it would come to this! We have to leave now. You're all I have left. Turn out the lights. You all be quiet for a second. What'd you see? I don't know. But something's not right. There are no crickets out. Is it? Motherfuckers. Come on now, why don't you turn those lights back on? - You piece of shit. - We got to find a way out of here. What's going on? Get down. Oh, my god. Stay down. Oh god. How many are there? Oh, god... Get the fuck up and start shooting. No, no. Stop it. Fuck! Are you okay? I'm good. Fucking bitch! - You alright, boy? - Yeah. Let's go. Got you. Who the fuck is that? What the fuck was that? Go, boy, go. - Pull back. - Pull back! It's Oliver. We're clear. They left to the north. I watched them go, all of them. Oliver. Ma'am. Man, you didn't hit shit. You missed on purpose. Whatever. Let's man up and go get these motherfuckers. - Fuck yeah. - I'm sick of them. Come on. Let's go end this shit. Your fuckin' mom was in the house, bro. Let's end those motherfuckers. Walking around like they run this shit. Now, we run this shit. Fuck, yeah. - Someone's fucking dying today. - Stop. Stop what? Come on. Lucas, what the fuck? Come on. Let's fucking go. Not like this. We don't have much around here. But at least we have a code. When two of us get to having a disagreement, we meet, and hash it out. We don't ask for help. We don't need cops, lawyers, shit like that. We finish what we start. No one else ever needs to know. Lot's been going on around here. Lucas and Ben decided to settle things man to man. No one interferes. Now, after today, it don't matter how it goes, we don't talk about it. We don't ask about it ever. Don't lose it. Lucas, you ready? Ready, brother? Go to it. Yes! Focus. Lucas! He ain't got shit. Always got to be on your toes. Back up. That's what I'm talking about. Oh, my god. Oh, shit. Come on. Yeah! Come on. Did your mother tell you about our special night in the bar, huh? Don't let him get in your head. She's a real sweet fucking mover, man. - No! - Stay focused. You listen to that. Shame your sister died before I got a chance to fuck her, too. He's scared now. Oh, yeah, he's scared. Don't let up. Nice one. Fuck. That's the fuck I'm talking about. You think you can just go out and have your fun, be a man and who cares what happens. You leave people behind. There's some things in life you can never come back from. End him. How do you like that, motherfucker? Huh, how do you like it? This shit gets ugly, but it's better we settle it here and out in the streets, man to man, to keep everything from falling apart. We don't need gangs. We don't need cops. We don't need armies. It doesn't have to be anyone else's problem. Get through! - Come on! - Damn it. Kill him. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. Do it! Do it. Take him out. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! You got this. He's out. He's out. Lucas, let him go. It's over. It's over. After this, it's done. It's not the air you cut off when you choke someone like this, it's blood. Blood passed from fathers to sons. You got to be man enough to let this go. Step up. Be a man. - Come on. - At first it hits you so hard you don't feel it. Then it squeezes tighter. He's fucking out. Then, you're just... ...gone. - Put the guns down! - Put your fucking guns down. I swear to god... We came here to stop this shooting. You better put that fucking gun down. Put the guns down now. Shoot. Put it down. Come on. We've come here to stop the shooting. Come on, let's stop it! Fuck! Memory is a motherfucker. Every act of violence leaves its ghosts. Remember them and we evolve. Bottle them up and they come back for us over and over forever. Until we're just... ...gone.
