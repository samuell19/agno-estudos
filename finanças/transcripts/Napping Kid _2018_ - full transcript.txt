What the hell? Who is he? ls it a prank? K Kidnapper If we don't pay, he'll share it to the public? What document is so important? What document is that? It is a budget analysis we did for a listed company Of their financial performance Which of course wasn't particularly good That's why it's price sensitive We'll announce financing plan on the press conference on Friday If this document leaks out We'll be blamed for not doing our jobs That will affect their stock price greatly Which company is that? Shen Jun The Taiwanese computer manufacturer? How did the file get stolen? We suspect that someone hacked into our server How many employees can access this file? They are all in the meeting room next door Huh? Just the two of them? There's one more Have you called Makino? I have, but still can't reach him I will keep calling Who last accessed the file last night? Last night... After I finished my work I uploaded the file to the server. Who knows...

I did But I couldn't find it So what? John received a ransom note through his email Saying that someone kidnapped that file Someone kidnapped the entire file? How difficult is it To completely erase a backup file From your company's server? This has nothing to do with difficulty From IT's perspective, it's a matter of whether you know or not But if he can hack into our server And take the entire document Without leaving a trace He must be an expert We received another email Let's get started The first email Open at 6pm Thursday The second email Open at 1 1 pm on Thursday And the third At 1 pm on Friday First, open before dinner tomorrow Second, open before going to bed tomorrow night And lastly open at lunch the day after tomorrow Why need to do it three times?

I didn't get it A bunch of mainlanders binge-bought them all Binge-bought? That means they bought all of them There are so many jewelry shops in Hong Kong? How could they buy it all? I won't just go to any shop for the diamond of an engagement ring Have to order it from a specific place Haven't you proposed before? I ordered it for him actually ls the ring the most important thing in a proposal? Of course But it's settled Luckily Siu-yu brought me up there last week The place is kinda dark and old But It's definitely super cheap I can't resist I helped Makino order it That shop does wholesale A lot of our colleagues bought there I waited for an hour just to pick the diamond up All of a sudden, a bunch of mainlanders barged in God knows what they told the owner behind the closed door Then he owner came out and said All diamonds have been bought by them He will have to reorder my diamond later So I ran over And started arguing with one of the mainlanders And then he hit me and broke my phone My Sugar phone Why didn't you hit him back? Come on I'm fine with paying a few thousands to buy a new phone This suit I'm wearing is expensive What if it's ruined? How about your company phone? Company phone? It stays in the company, right?

They are working on a project called C-H-O-K CHOK I bet you've never heard of it? Anyway, it's a huge online platform The world is waiting for its launch But the project just got discontinued We won't be announcing this news to the public yet Then aren't they... Lying to the small shareholders With you guys? Press conference is about repacking That's not lying We always see things so differently Ashley Give Securities Regulatory Commission a call about this Yes, sir Say no to reclamation! Say no to relocation of the pier! Stop cutting ferry service! We want the ferry back! Protect Victoria Harbor! Protect Victoria Harbor! Protect our land! Reclamation can solve housing and land problems The city needs to be developed. We have to look ahead Switch to Channel 38 - Alright - Protect Victoria Harbor! Protect our land! Regarding Shen Jun's press conference on Friday What do you think, Francis? We all know that CHOK is the new generation... Hey. He's talking about CHOK It is a smart home control system As well as a cryptocurrency Users can share consuming experience with it Everyone can be a part of it It sounds easier said than done Think about how popular smart home systems are now Will the major businesses be willing to cooperate? Shen Jun has been talking about this project for years When will it actually be done? A picture got leaked on the internet Just before the press conference It's claimed to be a screenshot from CHOK They claimed that there's a loophole in this platform User's information might be leaked by that Francis, do you think this is credible? User's information get leaked? To the mega corporations? Or to the government? As far as I know That was indeed a screenshot from the CHOK platform But I've talked with many... Developers and beta testers They don't know why this screenshot got leaked What is the motivation? With all that work, they probably won't get the money What is this for? So they get more likes If they think it's fun, they will do it Officer Tong, I just called SFC They said there's nothing abnormal with Shen Jun's stock price They'll keep a close eye Don't count on them Call and remind them Every 2 to 3 hours Yes, sir I'm heading out for a bit Yes, sir. Got it Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to the annual meeting of Chik's Group For the last 3 years We successfully diversified our business profiles From traditional hardware manufacturing to IT financing If he knew who my grandfather was Then I'd be in big trouble Your house is big Mr. Chik, Mr. Chik, one question They are concerned Are you still the one in charge behind the scene? These three men on television Are my family Excuse me Just another old-fashioned story Since my uncle took over the business He started investing in technology stocks No comment My grandfather has officially retired And is no longer our CEO Making money by tempering financial statements It's a risky business So how did they make sure they won't lose money? They work with the banks And transfer all the risks to individual shareholders With the help of these financial experts A lot of people will buy this My family is doing this evil business And now this is happening with Shen Jun If the hi-tech bubble collapses, I'm telling you I can't watch it anymore Wong Chiu I'm going to their office To check their backgrounds Watch those guys for me Report to me if you see anything strange Yes, Officer Tong Ma Hon Hurry down to the lobby of your service apartment See if you spot some tall men in black Sneaking around nearby Got it Are you alright, Officer Tong? Great, you're still here I'm going to Shen Jun for a meeting They have been hacked And their information have been leaked online Hey, you know what? I got a new Mustang 2 months old It's gorgeous, what a beauty I saw it on my wife's Facebook Oh, she's your ex-wife, right? Your ex, not your wife anymore Because there's a difference Hey, you should have cut the left lane earlier What are you doing? Did you see the white car? The white car behind us Has been there for a while I know you are trying to get rid of these guys But we're going the wrong way We're supposed to go to Kowloon Sit tight We are turning left You can't turn left There's a construction Otherwise how can we get rid of them? The construction site is the only place they won't go Everyone in Hong Kong knows the construction is not done yet Didn't you see the roadblocks? Don't you go! I'm calling the police now The police? That's impressive So the police can do whatever they want now? What do you want to do now? I don't need you to tell me what to do Let's go! Hello We are here for Carlos Please follow me Alright. Thank you Thank you John Hot Americano with two extra decaf espresso shots And soy milk You are the best That's impressive of you to remember all that It's a complicated order The sensor at the front door recognized John And CHOK recalled his favorite kind of coffee Carlos - Hello - Good to see you This is Officer Tong He's with Commercial Crime Bureau Your CHOK has pinpointed me Carlos CFO of Shen Jun "Pinpointing" is a good term I like it It recognizes your face And opens a file of you It will be able to identify your face What's so special about it? A coffee shop membership card Can record customers' preference too No Those are merely records Ours are big data They are completely different One day, this will be developed to a level Where you don't even have to drive anymore Every day The car comes and picks you up automatically You can save money from not hiring a driver That sounds good on paper Let's get back to the screenshot How is it? ls it real? I like that you are so straightforward That screenshot is real That's why this Friday We're counting on John for the press conference My team is working on it The first screenshot Got leaked There will be a second one anytime now Have you thought about who did tis? I suspected it might be an employee called Zachary He used to work in Silicon Valley 2 years ago, our CEO headhunted him He is a weirdo, no one gets along with him He's on gardening leave right now Your Hong Kongers have a similar term "Sterilization Period" "Sterilization Period" is a good term You said you don't get along with him? In what ways? He is a bit of a... Perfectionist, I guess? He is impulsive He's in his 30s, but acts like someone born in the 90s Just like what you Hong Kongers say He's a bit of a chav Chav How was it, Ashley? Officer Tong, I arrived at Tai Hang Road Nothing so far Good I'll be there soon You are asking me if I know anything? I should be the one asking you Officer Tong didn't explain anything again He's infamous in our bureau He doesn't play by the rules And he never solves any case I read the file There's nothing in it Nothing in it? Hong Kong is a mess now, I don't understand why you came back Isn't it better staying in the United States? I have no relatives Here in Hong Kong I really can do whatever I want And I don't count being a nomad I'm very free here And Hong Kong has what I want Then what is it that you want? Officer Tong Did anyone come back to the 2nd floor? No, not even the men in black you mentioned How did it go with the leads? An officer saw Makino in Central in a surveillance video As for the blackmail email Somone is working on it The guy you just told me about, Zachary We are also looking into him We just need a little more time Time The press conference is happening the day after They said we had 3 days to investigate, but not even 2 now Who said we had 3 days? My ex-wife She sweet-talks me into helping her By the way, Officer Tong Now that you open a case, but there's nothing in the file Aren't you worried that Commisioner Shiu will see it? I will handle Shiu myself But most importantly We still don't know what the kidnappers want It's just a $1 90,000 ransom They are obviously trying to play games Those men in black downstairs definitely have something to do with it If we assume K Kidnapper is an outsider Then one of the people in the service apartment Must be a snitch But not the mastermind It's them again Police Why did you park your car on the walkway? ID, please Fellow officer Have fun - Hey, buddy - Yes Be careful patrolling around Tai Hang Road tonight Something might happen Okay, no problem How about SFC? Do they have any news? They said the trades look normal No abnormal transactions before they closed But Ronald Apparently used a company under his name To buy 1 00,000 shares of Shen Jun's stock Fuck! ls he watching us? Didn't we confiscate his phone? He bought the shares before he went to the service apartment I went to sing karaoke with some colleagues last night I got home at midnight to work So you brought work home because you wanted to have fun? Can't you be a little more responsible? It's actually a legal transaction Just that it happened at an odd time And I thought he and that girl, Shek Siu-yu Were not suspicious You should have backups on your server, right? I just asked someone to look for it But the backup file has been deleted too Huh? Who was it? Dylan Chik from IT Department Actually, Officer Tong Have you doubted your ex-wife and John? You also think they're having an affair too? I'm not saying they're having an affair I meant if they are suspects too Officer Tong Someone's coming out Send these photos to Wong Chiu now Tell him to ask that IT guy, Chik If he knows these two men Okay Wait Hey Officer Tong! We've got nothing to protect ourselves. Don't go Let's go Sir Oh yes Nothing really happened today Irene sent a lot of Whatsapp messages to John On business matters? Yes, I watched her send them If not, I'll screencapture them for you next time Sure Huh? All conversations? Take a rest on the 27th floor I'll take it from here Thank you, sir Morning, sir You don't have to stay overnight I am responsible It doesn't seem right that the kid was recommended By such an important man to work in this position He's recommended by the CEO from the headquarter His grandfather is the CEO's friend I understand What do you understand? Nothing I found Zachary's apartment It's nearby The Man Mo Temple "Future belongs to the next generation" "We should listen to them" Officer Tong? My colleagues said you'd like to see the manager. I'm the manager It's you? What a coincidence! I didn't know it's you It's been 3 years, right? Why are you working here? Actually... This service apartment is a social enterprise Anyway Are you looking for Mr. Sze? He should be in Hong Kong now He stays here for 3 months every year Zachary's mum is a Hong Konger She lives in Lantau Island She usually sends letters to her son here Here it is There's an address on the envelope He should be staying with his mum now And Shen Jun notified us that Zachary will be checking out after this month Maybe he resigned Hey That's not okay If Officer Tong knows about this, I'll get blamed It'll be quick Look at how this silly pig sleeps Silly pig? You two are... Enough with taking photos Just take the last one Zoom in here And take one more photo - What did you take? - You dozing off during work hours! Let me see it. Give it to me Let me see it I have proof She's using her cell phone I'd like to complain that she's using her cell phone That student has preferential treatment I'm giving my phone back to my teacher now Hey If I can find my phone Then we will know the truth You aren't asking me why I can get online, are you? As a professional IT guy Stealing wi-fi is the basics Yeah! I know! Not again If we use computer to open the emails The kidnapper will know Then why don't we open the emails with our phones? Damn it! That doesn't work either? Uncle Actually... What is it that you want? Hey kiddo, I'm done with you It's true I don't know But still I'm a better person than you What can you do about it? Stop trying to brush me off I've never believed a word you say Dr. Wu has so many patients to care for Why would he decide to leave the hospital For a vacation now? Let me see him Sir, he's really not here Give me a break Are you guys crazy? How could you discharge my mum when her doctor is not here? Why don't you give me his number and let me talk to him? No, sir, that's not allowed in the system System. We're talking system now? The world is ending because of system You are crazy I'm telling you My mom will not leave the hospital You hear that? Sometimes, ignorance ls a bliss Fuck you! Hey, that's mine You can argue, but don't throw things You think we don't know? You only got to work here because of your grandpa Everyone knows about this Your grandpa is Chik Kuen You're born with a silver spoon Who are you to criticize me? Come on, come and fight me Throw a straight punch You can throw things, but don't fight Yeah Go and play with your video games You don't need to work anyway You're the grandson of... The richest Chinese American You're not even born with a silver spoon You're born with a gold spoon! - Born with a gold spoon! - Shut up! Sit down! Born with a gold spoon Work Hi Excuse me Nurse I'm his friend. What happened just now? That's right The doctor said his mother is recovering well. He can visit her every other day now But he doesn't want to believe it Can you help persuade him? I'd like to have the contact of the doctor I want to ask you a question first ls this related to CHOK? How do you know? CHOK is the only contribution I made To this world I don't know you And you came all this way to find me If it's not about CHOK, I don't see what else it is ls it about that screenshot? I have nothing to do with it Carlos wants me gone a long time ago He is just looking for an excuse to kick me out You believe him? Did he tell you about... CHOK and the driverless car? He's crazy! Do you know what that means? It can sell your information anytime The government will be able to track you Everyone of us will be monitored Even if you say a wrong thing It can... Lock you in the car And take you to the police station CHOK shouldn't be like this The world of CHOK should be a free state Isn't it good though? If someone breaks the law He'll be driven directly to the police station That's good Then you will lose your job Me? I'm going to get my pension soon It has nothing to do with me I'm blaming your generation Your generation Only cares about yourselves For you all you care is whether CHOK Can help you buy coffee But CHOK consists of a large amount of data It does more than just buying things for you It can... monitor or even countervail the system Through mass mobilization in network From then on Social mobility no longer runs by an unilateral decision Do your colleagues know about your thoughts? When did you start to disagree? They have been making a fool of me for over a year Okay They can make fun of me all they want This is between me and my company But they have no rights to mess with my testers And they still haven't paid me yet How much do they owe you? ls that your salary? It's not. Testers don't take salary, don't you know? Okay You'll never understand That's something else $1 90,000 $1 90,000 again? Could that be a coincidence? Hi Hi, Dr. Wu Hello, I'm Mr. Sze Are you alright? Hey Are you okay? You knew it too? We all knew it Okay Just give me time to calm down Or send me your photos again Did you find your phone? Not yet You can give me yours It's the same model anyway Will that make you feel better? Perhaps Okay My phone ls in this building Officer Tong, I just checked This guy is so annoying That everyone recognizes him That's why everyone here Can prove that he's been here the last 4 to 5 days Taking care of his mother But this is a case Where everything was operated through the computer The alibis Basically mean nothing Do you think he really did it? $1 90,000 He is related one way or another Go and talk to Miu See if those guys Have been involved with this fool lately? Yes, sir Oh, right, one more thing That Makino Did go to pick up the diamond that day But he didn't come back to the office immediately after He went to The serviced apartment where they are staying now Why did he go there? He dropped off a letter And went back to the office Only to find that everyone was at the service apartment So he rushed over There's something sneaky About all these guys Officer Tong, Mui Wo should be that way This road will bring us to Tai O We are here anyway. Let's go get some souvenirs Souvenirs? Whose is this? Why don't you pick it up? I don't want it anymore Officer Tong What are Dylan and Wong Chiu doing outside?
