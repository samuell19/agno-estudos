## Last round... We got three minutes. Cover the switch, Johnny... Keep your eyes peeled. Now, wait a minute! Keep your hands up and you won't get hurt. Ow! ## Gimme a drink. What? Anything. Well, whiskey, beer, or gin? Make it a beer. Did you hear about the shootin' at the arena? Yeah, I heard. Radio said that a cop was shot. Yeah, that's what I heard. I was goin' to the fights tonight, but I got stood up. That's funny, so was I. So was you what? Goin' to the fights or getting stood up? Both. Think we should cry in each other's beer? I got a better idea. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. What's you idea of fun? Same as yours. Let's go. Where to? I don't know. We could go dancin' or somethin'. I don't feel like dancin'. But, I like that "or somethin'." My place is just around the corner. We can have a drink and decide. Let's go. A guy could learn to like this. A guy could wait until he has a drink. I'll fix us something. Go on, sit down. Well, how do you like that? Not a drop in the house. Are you in a hurry to go someplace? I'm not going anyplace. And I'm in no hurry. Then relax. Now, there's a little liquor store, right around the corner. And I like scotch. Now, just fix us a cup of coffee. I'll get a bottle later. I don't want coffee. I want scotch and I want it now. What's the matter... Are you broke? Does that look like silk coupons? What's the matter... You ever seen money before? Well, yeah... Yeah, sure. But, that's an awful lot of it. Well, I'm a big spender. Well, maybe I might get two bottles of scotch and a carton of cigarettes, too. You can do better than that with me. I will... later. I'll be right back. ## Hello? Elizabeth... Elizabeth... You were calling your wife. Would you like us to bring her down here? You talked a lot, before you came to. Wife's gonna have a baby in a couple of months. Like to be around for it, wouldn't you? You'd better help us, Johnny... That kid's gonna miss you. You mentioned three boys... Who are they? Well, that was fast. Look what I had to come back to. I was just lookin' for glasses. Well, they're not in there... They're in the kitchen. I'll go get them. Make 'em tall ones. ## You wanted to get rid of me just so you could call the cops, didn't ya? No! There's plenty of liquor in there. Well, I have to have plenty of it around, without having to pay for it. You rotten liar! We just picked up Ollie Denker. Captain wants to talk to both of you. I'll keep this punk company. Okay, Johnny, you don't have to tell us. Relax now. Get good and well, so you can walk to the chair. Stanley, where were you all day? Well, I wasn't feelin' so hot, Mom. So, why you didn't say about the job at the box factory? Roy Winowski calls started to... and tells me he has job for you and you don't show up. So, let him finish. I'll give him a finish, all right. I lose my arm at the factory. They want to give my boy a job, so he can help us out. All right, tell me. Well, I felt this cold comin' on. So.. you stay out in the cold air half the night. Or maybe the roof in the factory has a leak, huh? Herman, the boy is sick. I want to teach you to have a job. That you should learn a trade. Is Stanley Badek here? - Police. - Who are you? Stanley didn't do anything. Stanley is a good boy. Yes, he is the best. Come on, let's go, Stanley. Where are you taking him? What for? Oh, just down to the station, ask him a few questions. Questions... what questions? Just questions, Mrs. Badek. Come on, let's go. A cop was killed last night. Doesn't sound important to ya, does it? This man wasn't just a cop... He was a husband and a father. He fought in Korea, so punks like you didn't have to go. He had a lot to live for, but he couldn't make it, thanks to one of you. One of you isn't gonna make it either. They're yours. I have been in court all day, tryin' to send a man to the chair for killing his wife. They were married over twenty years. I don't know... Maybe she drove him to it. But, you can't get away with murder. Right now, you don't look like killers. You look like four sad sacks. A jury might even feel sorry for you. You're not even criminals. You have no police record... My office checked on all of you. Four ordinary boys, it doesn't even make sense. Four boys and a gun. I don't think any one of you, on his own, could have done what the four of you did last night. You pushed each other into it. You each had a gripe. You added them all up, and look what it spelled: Murder! Eddie Richards... last week, you lost your job. But, there are always jobs for young fellas who want them. Why the sudden need for money? Say "hello" to Marie. Hi.Oh, it's you. You were expecting somebody else? Not here, Eddie, in the office. Well, you never minded before. You really got a number tonight. I'll have to take you to a better place than I figured. I can't go out with you tonight, Eddie. But, we had this date all week. Well, I have to break it. It's something I can't get out of. It's a friend of Mr. Thompson's from out of town. I thought you quit here at 6:00. Well, what could I do? I mean, after all, Mr. Thompson is the boss. Sure, and I only work here. There are lots of other nights. Let's not make a tragedy out of it. Tomorrow? Tomorrow. If I can live that long. Hey, where'd you get that? It's just a piece of junk I picked up. Since when is junk stamped "14 karat gold?" Oh, uh, excuse me, Marie. I didn't know you were busy. Oh, it's all right, Mr. Thompson. Eddie was just checking in. Checking out, she means. Now, about tonight. Morning, Eddie. Hi. What's wrong with you? We gotta have pancakes for breakfast every day. How about eggs, once in a while? Ya had eggs yesterday. They're kinda high right now. I don't care what they cost. I want them again, today. No, you don't care. I ask you for a few extra dollars, once in a while. You always complain about being broke. So, I'm a big spender. I'm always broke. But, I like to eat eggs. All right, all right... tomorrow you'll have eggs. But, Eddie, please, don't be fighting. I'm only tryin' to make a home for you and Sophie. Sophie should find herself a rich guy and get married. Maybe he can do something for me. Always somethin' for you. Yeah, something for me. If I had any guts, I'd get outta here, get a place of my own. Go to college, be somebody or something. If you're so ambitious, why don't you go to night school? Night school's for guys with glasses. So, get yourself a pair. Then, maybe you can see through Marie. Boy, I wouldn't let a guy push me around the way she does him. Look, you, I don't interfere in your love life, so don't tell me how to run mine. Why's he so upset this morning? Marie stood him up last night. She's no good for him. There are a lot of things that aren't good for us, Ma. But, we go for them, any how. Don't worry about us. ## What are you so happy about? Marie... she stood me up last night. She didn't show up for work this morning. They said she phoned in... She's got a cold. Look, you wanna stop by her place? See if she needs something? Yeah, good idea. ## Do you see what I see? Yeah... the boss. Look, Eddie, it might've been nothin' at all. Yeah, a real nothing. At 8:00 in the morning, she's in a cocktail dress, and he's wearin' a tux. So, she's got a yen for the boss, a lot of girls do. She'll get over it. She better. ## I'm gonna talk to Marie. Look, Eddie, you're not gonna do anything stupid, are you? No, I'm just gonna get things straightened out, that's all. Hello, Eddie. Have a good day? Look, Marie, I... I want you to quit your job now, tonight. What are you talking about? What's the matter with my job? Him... Thompson. Oh, Mr. Thompson happens to be... I know what he happens to be, what he is. I know about last night, Marie. It wasn't any out of town friend you were out with, it was him. Look, I don't blame you. A guy like that, the boss and all. He can put pressure on a kid like you, make you think... Make me think that what, Eddie? Nothing. Look, let's just forget it and make like it never happened. I think that's a very good idea. Great, I'll go clean up and wait for ya. Where do you wanna eat dinner tonight? We're not going out tonight, Eddie. But we got a date. I'm breaking it. I made other plans. With him? What kind of a line has been handing you? Oh, why don't you grow up, Eddie? I'm going out with Mr. Thompson because I want to go out with him. I know what I'm doing and why. You only think so. I know so! You don't think last night was the first time, do you? Where do you think this came from? And there'll be more. You little, no-good... Why, you lousy little... Get out... you're fired! That figures. ## All right, let him help out. Eddie? We've been here all day, Eddie, come on. It's late, we oughta go home. Marie was no good for ya, Eddie. You're better off without her. Am I? Sure. How am I better off, Stanley? Sittin' here with you? Drinkin' in this rotten wedding hall? T-this stinkin', lousy club? Well, she was always givin' you trouble. She gave me the kind of trouble I like. She kept you broke all the time. You know of a better way of spending money? Yeah, but there's always some guy that can spend more than you. And there goes your girl. Then I gotta get more. How? Not drivin' a truck, that's for sure. I'm out. Wonder what happened to Eddie? Boy, is he high. Ollie Denker... you were a runner for a bookie. You say it's just a job. You couldn't wait, could you, Ollie? What is this, Lover's Lane? Why don't you him in, make him some pancakes? Ollie likes pancakes, don't you, Ollie? Eddie, go on in and sleep it off, huh? Let's wake up the old lady, she'll make us some pancakes. For heaven sakes, Eddie, go on in. I... I gotta protect my little sister, don't I? Come on, Eddie, you're cracked. Come on in. Stop shovin'... I don't like shovin'. You get right in there, Eddie. You, too, Sophie. It's the middle of the night. How about some pancakes, Ma? Eddie, you've been drinking. How'd you guess? Next thing, you lose your job. I got news for you, Ma... I lost it. I'd better go in now, Ollie. After a while. I'm gonna see you tomorrow. Where would you like me to take you tomorrow? You don't have to take me anywhere. You spent an awful lot of money tonight, Ollie. You sure you can afford it? You let me worry about that. When you're out with me, you're livin', right? I saw that check you paid, though. That's more than I make in a week. So, I like expensive places. Tomorrow night, I think I'll take you to the Zanzibar. I haven't got that kind of clothes. Then get 'em. Go to Tyler's tomorrow, during your lunch hour. Pick yourself an outfit, I'll pay for it. Oh, I couldn't do that, Ollie. Why not? You're my girl. Let's just wait till we get married. Yeah, I see your point. You better go in. I'll see you tomorrow, huh? ## Hi, Ollie. Hiya, Joe. Hey, you know Sidney and George. Hiya! You take a long time to say "good-night," don't ya? He's a little slow with the girls, eh? No, not Ollie... Not with the girls. Come on, jump in... I'll give you a lift. No, where I'm going isn't that far, Joe. I can walk. I wouldn't let you walk home, on a dark night like this. Come on. If I known you guys were waiting, I wouldn't have kept you so long. You like the girls, huh, Ollie? Like to show 'em a good time, huh? Nothing wrong with that, is there? No, no, I do it myself. Only, um, we both seem to be doing it on my money. Ollie, I gave you a job because I like you... You're a bright boy. But, now it's time you got a little brighter. Joe, if you think I'm holding out What, did I say any money... anything like that? No, no, it's just that you've been a little slow in turnin' in your collections, Ollie. About $300 slow. Believe me, I turned in everything but about $50. I ran a little short... Where'd you drop the $300, Ollie? On the girls, like the one you were just with? Honest, Joe, it wasn't that much. Shut up! You made a mistake, Ollie. On your salary, you can't afford to go out with girls you like. You've gotta go out with girls that like you. Remember that. And remember this... anytime anybody spends Joe Barton's money on women, it'll be Joe Barton. All right, I'll give you a week to get up to 300. I can't raise that kind of money in a week... How can I? You spent it in a week, now get it. Hey, Eddie, how much would it cost to go out on a date with somethin' like this? By the time you could afford that, you'd be too old. Hey, if you're, uh, sore about last night... Oh, forget it. You were sauced up. How you guys fixed for dough? Don't look at me, I got fired yesterday. My old man gave me $20 this morning to buy new shoes and a hat. Go buy shoes. I need $300. I'm on the hook with Joe Barton. What'll he do to you, if you can't get it? I don't wanna find out. Take my $20, Ollie. Put it on Johnny in the fights, tomorrow night. That's no good, Johnny's even money. Well, take the $20 to the track and catch yourself a long shot. So it misses... Stanley's barefoot. Hey, look, a stranger. Hi. Heard you haven't been around here in a month. A fella gets married, it keeps him outta pool rooms. Now that everybody's here, for a change, how about celebratin'? Four-handed rotation, like we used to. Yeah, go ahead and set 'em up, Stanley. I'll play, but I don't feel much like celebratin'. I just left Elizabeth at the doctor's. Somethin' gone wrong? Well, she's gotta have a caesarian. Operations like that cost plenty. Where you gonna get it? Well, I just have to win a couple more fights, that's all. I never heard of a rich amateur boxer. Well, if I win tomorrow night and go on to the finals, there's a chance I can turn pro. Might as well start the celebration now. I'll break. Well, this is it, boys. Hello, Ollie. How do you like it? Looks good to me. Charlie, what are you doin', throwin' us out? I said you and your friends could use this place 'til I found a tenant, Ollie. You mean these punks are gonna pay you rent? When can we move in? Any time. How about tomorrow? Fine... come around to the office with the first and last month's rent and it's yours. Oh, Ollie, you'll clean the place up for the boys and get him the keys to the front door. Hey, the place'll be great. We'll put the tables up on the stage and serve drinks there. You boys'll have to get the pool table outta here. Big operators, huh? Just smart. We throw a dance once a month. Pays the rent, makes us an extra buck. Mm-hmm. Who comes to a dance in a joint like this? Shall we tell him? The guy's from left field... tell him. A lot of people come. We give away a TV set, that's why. They buy a ticket to the dance, they get a free chance at the TV set. Hey, that's a good idea. He likes it! Glasses likes the idea. I don't think you wanna throw a dance here. Why not? It wouldn't work. He says it wouldn't work. You might run into trouble. What kind? Well, uh, say some guy is dancin' with somebody else's girl and he, uh, somebody else, he doesn't like it. We can handle that. What if he gets sore and gives you this? Then I give him that. And what if he gives you this? Then I give him that. How would you handle that? ## Stanley! Stanley! ## Stanley! Eddie, I don't think they wanna rent the place. I'll say they don't. Well, tonight's the night. Sure was a great idea you had, Ollie... to have a dance. Aw, it was nothin'. Too bad you couldn't get a date for Stanley. Yeah, Stan, I tried... Oh, don't worry about me. I'll be too busy countin' the money. You hope. Anyway, Sophie will give you a break. She'll save a dance for you. What are you gonna wear tonight? Oh, I don't know. I thought maybe the dress I wore last Saturday. Mm-mm, this is a big night... special. Oh, no, Ollie, Here's $50. I can't... I'll bet you'll look great. I can't take money from you. Well, you're not... I'm givin' it to you. You wanna look like the girl that Ollie brought, don't you? Get goin', those swanky shops close early. I thought you were gonna give that $50 to Joe Barton on the $300 you owe him? So I changed my mind. He's not gonna like it, Ollie. Your week was up yesterday. Well, I'll give it to him tonight. You better go tell him. We don't want him startin' no trouble. All right, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll tell him. Come on, I'll introduce you. Well, I'll stay here... Y... you go ahead. There's, uh, stuff to do. Well, he's a good guy to know. What's the matter... You scared or somethin'? Me... Let's go. You didn't tell me it was upstairs. So, I'm tellin' you now... It's upstairs. Very funny. Where does it go? Right up here, Mr. Merkel. We got a place all set up for it. Right here, huh? That's it. Ain't it a beauty, Ollie? It oughta be, at $159.95. That's rock bottom. Also, cash on delivery. We'll pay you tonight. It ain't delivered tonight, it's delivered now. Well, we don't get the money 'til tonight, when the people buy tickets to the dance. I got nothin' to do with any dance. All I got to do is with this here set. $159.95 and I don't leave 'til I get it. Then sit down and make yourself comfortable. My partner and I have a business appointment. Come on, Stanley. I'll wait out here, Ollie. All I'm tryin' to do is introduce you around. Joe might come up with a good job for you. I'll wait here. What do you wanna do? Spend your life bein' a clerk, or somethin'? Maybe... maybe I do. Okay, clerk... Wait for me. Hi. Ollie, I was worried about you. Yeah, about that $300, Joe. I'll have it for you tonight, after the dance. Yeah, that's, uh, that's a nice thing you got tonight, I hear. Yeah, well, it oughta be. I've been workin' hard enough on it. What, so hard that you forget your old friends? I wait for someone to come around sellin' tickets, nobody comes. Oh, well, I got some right here, Joe. Oh, yeah? All right, here's a ten, sell me. Thanks a lot, Joe. I'll see you tonight, after the dance, huh? Yeah, you sure will. Oh, uh, Ollie, one more thing. That $300 was due yesterday. Well, yeah, I know, Joe, but... The week was up yesterday. George, Jimmy. Ollie, you understand, I... I like you, but I'm a man of business. Joe, you gotta listen to me. Hey, n-not so... not so hard, fellas. He's gotta look pretty for his party tonight. Don't hit him in the face. Ollie, what happened? What happened? Nothing happened. I sold him four tickets. ## # Now sit right down and don't you get snappy # # and come over here and listen to your pappy # # gonna tell you somethin' that'll make you happy # # so relax a while in here # # eight nine ten I'll never get mad again # # sing you one two three four five # # six seven eight nine ten... # If you get tired, Elizabeth, you just say when and we'll sit down. # Don't pull your hair don't give your body # # any wear and tear just calm yourself # # and count together eight nine ten # # I'll never get mad again sing you one two three # # four five six seven eight nine ten # ## Hey, man, this is great, huh? Oh, Pops, that's no joke. Hey, give us a couple of tickets. Thanks. Take over, Freddy... I'm gonna drift. Right. ## Well, that was great. What does a guy have to do to get a girl, Sophie? Well, you either have to be good-lookin' or you have to have money. You, Stanley, you better get some money. Oh, here she is, Ollie. No bones broken. Thanks, Sophie. Sure, Stan, it was fun. Ollie, you're lookin' fine. Yeah, I'm pretty for the party. Uh, Joe, I don't think you met Stanley Badek. This is Joe Barton. Hi. I, uh, I haven't met all of your friends, Ollie. I'm sorry, uh, Sophie Richards, Joe Barton. How do you do.? He didn't tell me about you. Always holdin' out on me, huh, Ollie? See ya later, Joe. Listen, tell your partners if I don't get my money soon, I'm takin' the set back. I'm tired of waiting all ready. You'll get it... Look at the crowd we got. I should charge for my time. You got into the dance for nothin', didn't you? Who's dancin'? You should be. Hey, that TV guy is yellin' for his money. Let's go count the take. Hi, Fred. Hey, uh, you know, the next time you run one of these things, how about a piece for me? I... I got a charley horse in my arm just counting this stuff. Sure, Fred, maybe next time. You go ahead, we'll take over. Go grab yourself a dance. There's some real nice stuff out there. Yeah? Any prettier than that? Well, not much. ## Here, fill it up. This means an awful lot to us. We'll cry for you. Come on! Okay. Okay, now do yourselves a favor and just stay nice and quiet for a few minutes. Let's get Ollie and Johnny. Johnny, we're in trouble... Where's Ollie? Come on. Why, what's up? Look, don't worry... You sit down and I'll find out what's wrong. Johnny, please. I'll be right back. Johnny, be careful. Ollie, we got knocked off. Two guys came in and grabbed it, Ollie. The whole works. I know... Joe told me. It just happened a few minutes ago... How did you know? Bad news travels fast. Oh, it's tough, boys. But, when you go into business for yourself, you take risks. Hey, Ollie, everybody's yelling, it's time to give away the TV set. You wanna do something about it? Sure... tonight, we give everything away. Okay, Freddy... Go get the tickets. But, Ollie, we ain't got no TV set to give away. Tell 'em the truth, we tell 'em what happened. No... we'd get mobbed. We gotta rig this thing, some way. But how? If one of us wins it, we'd get mobbed anyway. I'll tell you how. You guys wait here... Come on. ## Well, do ya mind? Hey, Stan! Okay, everybody. Now, I know you're all anxious, so I won't waste any time. I'm gonna ask for a volunteer to come up here and pull out the lucky ticket. Now, who wants the job? Me! Me! I got one right here. Aww... All right, now reach inside and pick out the winner. Close your eyes first. I can't find my ticket. All right, n-now quiet, everybody. And the winner is Ms. Sophie Richards. Well, we better go get it. Come on, I'll give you a hand. 'Til I get $159.95, the winner of this set is me. Sure, you won it, you can have it. I'll explain it to you later. Gosh, I didn't expect to win. Oh, it's beautiful... How am I gonna get it home? We'll put it in my car. You don't. I'll take it home for you. Are you sure you don't mind? Oh, it's a pleasure. Sophie, I wanna talk to you. Oh, he's just gonna take me home and then I'll be right back. Uh, you go and get your coat, Sophie. I'll meet you out front, huh? Ollie, I'll see you later. This set stays here... it's mine. She, uh, she won it, didn't she? They didn't pay me. The poor girl paid for a ticket, didn't she? Do I owe you the money? No, you don't.All right. Then take it up where it belongs. I had a nice time at your party, boys. And, uh, Ollie, about that $300, I'll give you an extension... One more week. Now, do I get my money or do I get the police? Come on to the office. Johnny, I'm afraid here any longer. Go ahead, Johnny. I'll check with you tomorrow. ## All right, where's the money? Here's where it was. I didn't come in here for jokes. Look, the girl that won the set is my sister. I'll have it back to you first thing in the morning. I don't want the set now... I want $159... We know how much. You told us nine times, already. And, for the tenth time, pay up, or I call the police. Listen, Mr. Merkel, we wanted to pay. We just ran into some bad luck. You ever hear of that? Your bad luck, I ain't interested in. Look, this could happen to anybody. What if you dropped that set, bringing it up here this afternoon? I'm insured for that. All right, so you leave here tonight to get into your car and you find it stolen. He's insured for that too. I came up here to talk business. If I can't talk it here, I can talk it at the police station. I don't think he understands about our bad luck, Ollie. That's a nice jacket you got there. Now, if, uh, something should happen to it, you'd call it bad luck. Yeah, and you take that hat. Now, a man who has a hat like that wants to take real good care of it, you know? He wouldn't like it if somebody did this to it. Pick up the man's hat, Stanley. Not like that. Put it down, I'll show you. Now, that just shows you how things can happen. Eddie, I think the man wants to go now. Yeah, you'll, uh, have your TV set back tomorrow morning. You know what I think? Those two guys that knocked this place off, I bet they were Joe Barton's guys. Go home, Stanley. Well, can't we pin it on him? After all our honest work to pay him back, Ollie. We just lost, that's all. We're not gonna go on being losers. Come on, Eddie. Where are you going? With you guys. We don't need you, Stanley. Well, listen, fellas... Go home... Who needs ya? Stanley Badek, you come from decent, hard-working people. They had hopes for you, Stanley. Hopes that, maybe, in their old age, you could make things a bit easier for them. How do you think they'll feel now? You got something, Ollie? Yeah, I got something. Well, listen, fellas, it's not fair! We were partners on the dance, weren't we? And we're still partners. So, how can I go home? I'm with you guys. Okay. They might get broken. Hey, where we goin'? Out on the town, that's where we're goin'. Are you with us or aren't ya? But we got no money. Maybe he has. It's in the bag, kid. We're gonna have a good time. Yeah, wine, women, dancing. - But, that takes money. - Who cares? Money, we ain't got... but we're gonna get. Today was a good time, I tell ya. We're gonna have to pay for it somehow. Sure... you always pay, Stanley. That's a $1.45. Well, what do ya know about that? No money. You guys got any money? No. Oh, a comedy act, huh? Well, look, it's still $1.45. Sorry, pal. Oh! Help... Police, police! $16. Look, buddy, take it easy. We got tagged ourselves tonight for plenty. We're just passing it along to you. And don't go yellin' for coppers, because we got your number. We can always call on you, again. ## Hey, $23.50... that's not too bad. "Joe Barton"? Sure, why not? I think Joe'd leave a nice, big tip. Why not? Sure, Joe's a big-spender. Let's go. Gentlemen. Yeah? What is the trouble here? These gentlemen signed for their check. Well, I'm sorry, but we do not have charge accounts. You got one now. I'm sorry, I cannot do this, really. Look, someone owes us a night out and it just so happens to be you that is stuck with it. Paste that in your memory book. Yeah, and, uh, don't go makin' any phone calls, 'cause we can always come back. That's doin' it, kid. There you go. Johnny Doyle. You'd never done a bad thing in your life. Married a decent, nice girl... ...expecting a baby. A good life ahead of you, but you threw it out the window. ## Hi. You won? Well, you don't seem very glad. I'm not. That means you gotta fight in the finals. And I'm gonna win that one, too. Now, come on, let's eat. Steak, huh? Well, what did you have for dinner? Well, I had to throw away that stew we had yesterday. And, besides, you're a fighter, I read. You gotta eat steak. Now, look, honey. If you're gonna have a baby, I read that you gotta eat steak, too. Now, come on, we're gonna split this. I'm not hungry. Well, eat it for Junior. I bet ya he is. Now, come on, you sit right down here. What are ya doin' still up? Oh, I'm just finishing some knitting. Finish it tomorrow... come here. ## You know, when I woke up and found you weren't there, I got scared. Where'd you think I'd go? I didn't know. I dreamt you were gone... I couldn't find you. Johnny, I'll never leave you. Sometimes when I'm on the job, I think, "What would I do, if I didn't have you?" Everybody said we were too young to get married. They were wrong. We belong together. And nothin's ever gonna separate us. Johnny, don't fight anymore. But, all I gotta do is win next Friday's bout, and I'm champ. And then what? Well, then I'll get plenty of offers to turn pro. Look, honey, I know there's no future in fighting. But, well, I can make enough money on my amateur title and buy a truck of my own. You know, a fella with his own truck can make a nice livin'. How am I supposed to live through a year of you getting your brains beat out every other Friday night? Well, don't think about it. Just think about what it's gonna get us. Johnny, I'm scared. Then, just you pray for me next Friday night. I'll pray for you, Johnny. ## Go, Johnny! Johnny Boy! Get up, get up! Hello, Mr. Raymond. I could do it all over again. do ya feel, boy? Yeah, I bet you could, at that. Well, what do ya think? Well, I... I'd hate to meet you in a dark alley. He almost had me there in the third round. I guess you're here to talk business. Sit down, Johnny. Johnny, you're a great street fighter. I bet you could lick twice your weight in wildcats. But you're not for the ring. But I won. I just won the title. You just won the amateur title, Johnny. And the crowd loves you because you can soak up punishment. But the crowd doesn't know what that does to you. And, what's more, it doesn't care. Yeah, but, look, he didn't hurt me. I just got one little cut, that's all. Kid, believe me, two years up against the pros, you'll be walkin' around on your heels. And that crowd, the same crowd that's wild about you now, well, they wouldn't spit on you. Yeah, but, look, I've got a big stake in this. Look, Mr. Raymond, if you take me on, I'll work. I'll learn how to box... I'll do anything. Yeah, yeah, I could take you on. I could make money, we both could, for a year. No, I don't make my money that way, Johnny, and I wouldn't let you. Stay the amateur champ, kid. Retire undefeated. ## Hey, Johnny, he sign you? How much dough you gettin'? I bet you'll be World's Champ someday, Johnny. Let's get some air. Hey, you forgot your cup! Elizabeth's home, waitin' up for me, to hear the good news. I was gonna tell her she could have a private room in the hospital. I was gonna ask Mr. Raymond for an advance. "The Champ" it says here. It's supposed to be solid silver. It's gettin' rusty already. Let me have it, Johnny. You go first, Johnny, and pass it around. I don't drink. I mean, I didn't. Lots of things are wrong tonight, Johnny. We didn't plan on having our dance knocked over last night, either. Fighting's a tough racket, Johnny. You'll be glad you took Mr. Raymond's advice. It was only gonna be for a year or so. So I could make enough money to get things a little easier for Elizabeth and the kid. You got money, Johnny. Over there, in the arena. There must be five or six grand in that till. Who do you think brought it in, huh? Effery, the guy who owns the place? You did... They paid to see you. Yeah, well, quite a few did, I guess. They came tonight, they came last week, they came the week before because they wanted to see a slugger. Ollie's right, Johnny. You're entitled to that dough. I know one thing, Johnny, if I took the kind of beatin' you took, I'd want somethin' out of it. Oh, yeah, I got somethin' out of it, all right. Genuine tin. The last fight's probably on right now. They'll be closin' up pretty soon, Johnny. That's a nice chunk of dough. And it's as much yours as anybody's. We could all use it. You could buy a truck with your share and be in business for yourself. Elizabeth and the baby would like that, Johnny. But, only the four of us, we couldn't do it. There are five of us. ## We'll draw to see who carries the gun. You went out last night to get that handful of money and today, you're here. I could send all four of you to the chair. You're equally guilty... That's the law. But I'm gonna give you a break. Three of you can get life. That means that you'll be eligible for parole, someday. But, one of you has got to die. The one with the gun. Who was it? ## You wanna think about it? Don't take long... I'm a tired man. And I've got no patience. Well, one of us has to go, the man said. Who's it gonna be? Not me... I'm not takin' the blame. Nobody asked you, Stanley... Did anybody ask you? You guys didn't want me around in the first place. You said I was bad luck, remember? So not me. Why not, Stanley? Compared to the rest of us, you got nothin' to lose. You never even had a girlfriend, for one thing. You should talk about girls. Both you and Eddie got ditched. So, we'll get others. Johnny's got a wife and kid, almost. All right, say you don't take the rap. You'll get life, the D.A. said. You've been in here only one night. How would you like spend the next ten years locked up? There's no chance of parole before then. And then you get out, and what happens? You're ten years worse off than you are right now. Nobody'll have anything to do with you, including girls. You're a little guy that hasn't got a chance, Stanley. You'll get pushed around for the rest of your life, 'cause that's the kind of guy you are. Eddie's right. But you got one chance to do something really big... ...To be somebody. "Stanley Badek's a guy with real guts," folks will say. He stood up and took it like a man. That's how they'll remember you. Tell the D.A. you did it, Stanley, and you'll be a guy to remember. Stop it, will ya? I don't wanna talk about it... I just wanna get outta here! I wanna go home. Stanley, shut up! Look, leave him alone... You treat him like an idiot. You're acting like a couple of stoops yourselves. I was only tryin' to help. Oh, sure, help him right to the chair. Put the blame on Stanley and everything's great. Maybe you and Eddie think this is some kind of a game. Well, the D.A. isn't playin' any games. We got a murder on us... We killed a cop! What do you mean "we?" You're part of it, Eddie, as much as... Hold it, will ya? Look, we didn't mean to kill anyone, but we did. They guy's dead and one of us... Don't give us any sermons. Stop actin' like you're the judge. Stanley wants to take the rap, it's his business. Who said I wanted to take the rap? Nobody said it, so, shut up. Look, you can't put the blame on Stanley just because you can shove him around. We're all in this. So, it could be any one of us that has to go. Ollie, for instance... He started the whole thing. It was his idea, knocking off the arena. All by myself, I suppose. Nobody came with me, huh? Nobody woulda gone, if you hadn't thought of it. It's your fault, Ollie, the whole thing. All ready to put the blame on somebody else, aren't ya? The minute you think you're off the hook. Well, you're not off it... none of us are. So, stop tryin' to hand the ball to Ollie. I think Stanley's got something there. Why not hand the ball to Ollie? That's where it belongs. Listen, Eddie, lay off that. Why should I? You had the gun, you shot the cop. You gonna deny it? Sure, I had it. Because I drew the shortest piece of grass, that's why I had it. I'm tellin' you now, I'm not goin' to the chair for a blade of grass. That's not why you're goin'. You're goin' because you killed a cop. Did I ask you for that gun, hmm? Did I beg everybody to let me have it? Did I say, "Eddie, I gotta have the gun?" Well, did I? The D.A. doesn't care how you got it. All he wants to know is that you had it. That's all you have to tell him. I'll tell him nothin'... That's what I'll tell him. You had the gun, didn't you? Sure... you know why? Because you brought it. That's why our necks are in this, because of you! There's room for only one in that chair, Ollie. And I'm not sittin' on your lap! All right, break it up. Look, let's quit cryin' and face it. Three of us get paroled... maybe in ten years. And one of us goes to the chair. What we've gotta decide is... Who's gonna be the one? It's that easy, huh? I haven't heard you makin' any offers. We were doin' this whole thing for you, in the first place. We were tryin' to help you. Yeah, and, uh, just because we haven't a wife to hide behind... I'm not hiding behind anybody. I'll take my chances, along with the rest of you. Only, lets get it settled, that's all. Maybe Johnny shot it out with the cops? He's got a hole in his leg to prove it. Sure... the D.A. will go for that. That's a great idea. I've got a better one. Stanley, you still got your dice on you? Yeah. We'll roll for it... The low man goes. You mean, low man has to say he did it? Okay? That's fair... Everybody has the same chance. No... What's fair about it? I didn't get shot... I didn't shoot anybody. Why should I have to roll for it? Because the majority voted, that's why. It's three to one, Eddie. Maybe I don't wanna roll dice. Maybe you don't have to. It's three to one... We can just elect Eddie. Oh, no, you don't. You don't get away with that. Who rolls first? Stanley's got the dice... He might as well. How about somebody else go... Come on, roll 'em! Somebody look for me. You got a five, Stanley. Five? You wanna go next? No... I'm in no hurry. Come on, dice. Boxcars... I'm out... Sweet Mama, I'm out! Just talk to 'em, Eddie. Tell 'em you're a friend of Ollie's. Well, they won't bite you, unless you roll under five. I'm not ready yet. Lemme have 'em. Two. Snake eyes. Tough, Johnny. I was hopin' it wouldn't be you. Roll 'em. Well, what do you know... Snake eyes again. You and Johnny roll again. Oh, no... not just Johnny and me. We all roll again... Not just Johnny and me. We all have to roll again. You and Johnny are low men. That's right... Ollie and me are out. One tie, all tied... That's the way I always play. Well, that's not the way we're playin' now. Why not? Because it wouldn't be fair to Stanley, that's why not. He rolled a five, he's next lowest. All of a sudden, you're worried about Stanley? Maybe it's because you're afraid you wouldn't come up with boxcars again, So we all roll again! You and Johnny roll. Do you want a vote? It's between us. Do you wanna go first this time? No... y-you take 'em. Eight. They go all the way up to twelve, Eddie. I found that out. That doesn't count... that's not my roll. Ten... too bad. That was my roll... That was my roll. I swear it was my roll. This is your roll. Do it again... Do it again. No, you don't... You don't get the first look. Let go of me! Stanley will tell you what they say. You rolled a seven. I don't believe it... You read it wrong, Stanley. Then go look for yourself. Eddie, I'm sorry. Johnny, I've been thinkin'. Ten years, is that what they'll give us? If we're lucky. I don't think I can take it, Johnny. Well, it's been done before... People have done it before. Yeah. Guess it'll be tougher on you, though. Like Ollie said, I never had anything. You've got Elizabeth. Were you hopin' for a boy or a girl? A girl. They don't get into so much trouble. She'll be ten years old before you ever got... I know how old she'd be, Stanley. You don't have to tell me. Still, we're better off than Eddie. At least, we got a chance. We'll get out. Maybe I can meet a girl that don't know nothin' about me. Yeah-yeah, we'll get out. Cut it out, will ya? Maybe I'll meet a girl myself. Maybe I'll meet a hundred of 'em. Because I'm not gonna go through with it. I'm gonna live, like you guys. I got just as much right! Who says? You lost, didn't ya? I'm not gonna die because Stanley happened to have a pair of dice in his pocket. You lost, I'm tellin' ya. I'm not gonna do it. I'm gonna live and nobody here is gonna stop me! Maybe you've got something there, Eddie. What's a matter with you, now? I've just been thinking that dice thing coulda been wrong. We're all in this together... We all killed that cop, not just the guy who rolled a seven. What are you tryin' to do? It's all settled, the whole thing. Shut up, Ollie. Johnny's right. I know that sounds funny, comin' from me, 'cause all my life, I've been the little guy, always scared of everybody else. Well, I'm still scared. But, I'm not gonna let Eddie take any rap for me. I killed that cop, just as much as he did... ...Or any of us did. You hear that, Ollie. You hear that? All I heard was a couple of crazy guys shootin' off at the mouth. That doesn't take you off the hook. When the D.A. shows, you're talkin' to him. I'm not dyin' for you. I'm not dyin' for anybody! You better do it for me, right now! All right, let him alone. We haven't got much time and we gotta decide something. Well, you've had plenty of time. What's the answer? All I wanna know is who had the gun. I had the gun. He's wrong... I had it. They're just coverin' for me... I had it. We all pulled that trigger. This could mean the chair for all. Does that change any of your answers? It doesn't change anything. ## Thanks, Ollie. ## If it were only yesterday...
