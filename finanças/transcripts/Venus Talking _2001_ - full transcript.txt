VENUS TALKING ... all of a sudden, he gave up drinking beer, then he started jogging. The first thing in the morning was a look on the scales. He’s got so skinny, I never thought a man could get that skinny. I married him because he’s an honest and open person, I thought he was not able to live. Bastard! Are you sure that Venus will manage it? Just listen: I planned a first edition of 50.000! Since I signed this damned contract, I don’t sleep well. That’s your problem! You are the meanest dog in the whole business! Everybody has a different style for the game. ...I’m coming home, glad to be back, hearing laughter from the bedroom... open the door... What next? My innocent Franz with that 22 year old blonde, in OUR bed! What would you have done being me? Shut the door. If I’d had a gun, I would have shot them both. Then I opened the door of the porch and chased them naked into the garden. Max never cheats on me. Hey Ralf! Max! Have you seen our wives? About 2 hours ago. I rather not think about the contents of their chattering. Never marry a publisher! At least if you are looking for someone to dance with. That’s because of the music. Hi, this is Sally Webber. Can I talk to Manuel? Hey, this is Sally! Just felt like it. The music? There’s a party going on here. My mother will go to Berlin for 6 weeks. Right... Of course you can visit me if you feel like it. Dear Diary, yesterday Manuel said that I’m a real cool girl. He’s the greatest boy in my class. I fell in love with him. Maybe I will marry him later on. Daddy doesn’t like him at all. I will force daddy to like him, too. No easy job! You’re driving quite fast. - Do you like it? Uh hum. What will you do if the police will show up? They never show up here! What’s the score? I despise this game! Oh Pluto! Gods are ageless! You simply have to stop smoking. - Where’s Franz? Don’t know. Take this... The winner may help me to lay the table. Congrats! Did you get the license for the film in this way, too? Will you come with us? Let’s play we are in love, OK? What do you mean - playing? Well, we take a deep look into our eyes... You take a look into my soul, and I will look into yours. May I kiss you? No. Sure thing. Take a break! Let’s dance! I rather watch you. It’s just 6 weeks. Dance! Right! Here are the drafts. And the critics will not see anything in advance. Even Reich-Ranitzki! Just when you will be finished, I’ll send the proof readings, you’ll correct them, and 3 days after the Frankfurt Book-fair, it’s in the shops! I’m thinking ahead. I know it. You will MAKE IT! Hey! Looks like you have a visitor. Hi! I quit just like that. No problem at all. You just need a good reason. Smoking is just shit! I’m not interested in computer at all. It’s just a machine that supports my working. Yes, but from now on, this machine will watch you at work and you can talk to her. But I don’t talk with anybody while working. Can I get another glass of wine? And for the last 3 months, not a single drop of booze, just a matter of internal attitude. Sally! Why don’t you dance with him? Don’t feel like it! - But I do! Normally, I employ 30 people for that, then it will be a success. Venus will manage that. That director will cost a fortune. But he won the German Film Prize 3 times. I would give my life away just for sleeping with you for a last time. Your mother is really great. - Sometimes a little too much. Isabell! I have to go. My father wants to leave. Too bad. We will be back for picking the plums. You’ll have a permanent web connection, and I’ll be able do remote operations, and that eye at the PC is a web cam. Are you finally done? If he talks about computers, he just can’t stop. Isabell! So you really think that will be of interest for anyone? Yes. Actually for me! The whole world will watch you while writing. Isabell, just come here! COME! Coming! Pluto, watching someone writing is nothing but boring! I’d rather have a second camera in your kitchen. I would have killed you, Pluto! - I thought so! I rely on you. My company takes big risks with all this. - Good luck! OK. Isabell kissed me on the mouth. I kissed her, too. Did you see it? Yes, I saw that. His parents are dead and he basically lives with his aunt. She’s a very wicked... Are you coming, Max? - Yes, I’ll be there in a minute. ...they have a garden and a little house... Good night, Sally! - Night, mom! ...and they are, well... very delicate and... and he’s so very different. And he’s a wizard, too... Time to sleep, my son! That wasn’t your last kiss. But now she’s gone. Call her. Or write. You can write all about your feelings to her. But don’t pretend anything. But she wouldn’t come if you are not here. Isabell will find a reason to come. Good night! - Night, mom! Take good care of yourself. Sally said you should exert yourself, so it will be a good book. I’ll do my best. As you always do. It’s just 6 weeks! I will surely miss you all. Daddy will take care of everything. I instructed him very well. We’re old enough, Daddy too! Don’t worry, everything will work fine. Remember: no calls! (marketplace chattering)... How much? - 2.50! Thanks, have a nice day! - Bye! I’m in love with the world! With all people, all plants, all animals. The stones, the plants and water, most of all water. The sun, moon and stones. The whole universe... I wish you a marvelous first working day! PS: Don’t forget: I’m watching you! P. You are a perverted asshole! Greetings from Venus Autumn Tale Eric Rohmer I lied. He’s very much alive. And I will not leave him or betray him. So why all this theater? Wanna dance? - I rather watch. Want a drink? - I got one, thanks. May I talk with you? - Sure! You have taken my seat. - Is that so? Nonsense! - What’s your name? Venus. Romeo! Will you come with me? - I’d rather take a cab. Come with me. I’ll you something. OK! You do paintings? Well... I’m a painter. Do you always paint people? Yes, every night. Just as if you were waiting for me. - Want a drink? These are my windows. Good morning. - Good morning. It’s my cellphone. Thorsten Webber! Isabell! Yes... Will I see again? Maybe. When? THE ADVENTURE (canceled) VENUS TALKING It’s raining heavily outside... August 16th, 01:15 PM 2 scrambled eggs, toast, chives, 1 tomato. It’s warm. I’m waiting. Would like a glass of white wine, but not before the evening. I’m waiting. Headache. I’m waiting. My real name is Isolde Berggün. Are you nuts? My entire master thesis is on that drive. I hope you closed it. I’m looking for something. But not on MY PC. You are such an asshole! - Yeah. A dot before de! Will you be at home this evening? Piss off, Betty! I have to do some work! That’s unbelievable! Rubbish! That’s real easy, it’s a permanent connection. I don’t get it. That must be very expensive. Not at all, just 3 pennies a minute. You can read what she’s writing. (The text she wrote 2 min ago) Poor Venus! I think that’s stupid. - What? She’s writing lots of things that are not true. Look, she stands up. Turn it off! - But... I said Turn it off! If only I knew what to write. How does Love start? 4 Mark! That’s for my big sister. She fell in love. Good luck! To your sister... Bye! - Bye! Young Couples I like to be older. Because of the freedom and all that, but I don’t want to be so stubborn as adults are. Yes! Sometimes they don’t grasp that things are important to us which they know nothing about. If you see me, I might be with you, but you are not with me. The more I show you of myself, the less you know about me. The more you penetrate me, the less you will reach me. Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes. Did someone phone for me? - No. I convinced my Dad and will get a cam tomorrow, so I can be with you all the time I have to think about you all the time and it hurts so much inside. Hello Mom, Isabell wrote to me! What’s up? She does not work. She can’t work all the time. - Dinner is ready! Shit! Daddy, you are the best cock ever! Mom may take a trip more frequently. I’m missing her a little. Of course, you are her husband. What did you read beneath your desk at school today? Well... Hanna wrote a poem. She wanted me to review that. I have to go to Manuel! - First the homework! But... - First the homework. OK? That poem... Is it good? Hello It’s me! Would you like to go out for dancing? Not me. You! Just ring and I will come down to you. Gee! For you! What happens next? Trust on me. What are you doing to me? You are a Mafiosi? Nope! So you wanna kidnap me, right? Yes! Manuel! This is the most secret bar of Berlin. Every newbie has to be blindfolded. So he won’t tell the address. If you don’t abide, you’ll be banned. Coletta, this is Venus! - Hello! I’ll show you a secret. You have to swear that you won’t tell anyone! Like this: And you have to say... "I swear not to tell anybody about what Sally told me" I swear not to tell anybody! You may touch them. Now I’m your wife. I stopped reading books years ago. Reading keeps me away from life. All that written stuff is not true. It sound good, but it’s not true at all. My brain was so misty, I already had troubles with real people. All those books stood between us, no woman was the right one and said the right word at the right time. With Salinger, they all say the right word. Do have a girlfriend? Nope. But you go to the movies, right? - Movies are even worse! I can fall in love within 10 minutes, why should I watch other people for 2 hours doing that? We will go to the movies sometime, OK? Good night! Sleep tight! Daddy! Yes? What shall I do if a boy wants to kiss me? If you like him or if you don’t like him? If I like him, of course. Kiss him back. Night Daddy! Good night! Sleep tight! End of the day! Daddy! I need a web cam. Can I have your credit-card? Why do you need a web cam? - Just 229 Marks! Does it have to be? You must not tell it to anybody! Isabell got one, too. When we phone, we will be able to see each other. That’s important. I can see that. But you won’t get a gift for your next birthday. That’s OK! Good night! - Sleep tight Daddy! My dear wife, everything is going on well. Both kids have fallen in love. But I do miss you, surprisingly. I noticed how much I still love you. Still almost 6 weeks... Your husband! (abridged) Do I appear in your book? Surely. EVERYTHING appears in my book. Something important? Yes. Very much so. It’s from my husband. You’re married? You didn’t tell me that. There was no time to talk about it. Great! I love him. Even if I’m sleeping with you. Can you understand it? Nope. It works. No, that’s not part of the deal! I just want to talk to her for 10 minutes. Just be patient for a while. The stuff she’s writing now, it’s... She need some time... Fuck, just give me her number. - Bernie! You bought the film license, nothing more. Do I really have to employ a private dick in order to find that bleeding glasshouse? She don’t want to see anybody, don’t you understand? She will see ME. Believe me. Why don’t we bury that thing as well? Yes? Hi Isabell! Great that you call. ...colon I see you! - Now we can talk every evening. I’m getting a cam, too. You will see me, too. 20 square-meter glasshouse, to be viewed from all directions. A devilish pentagon. A charade. Everything open, everything a lie. I’m just a big lie. What could be created here? Nothing but rubbish! A glasshouse, without contact. Contact-less. A glass wall between me and the world. The world is a foreign language to me. I can be seen. I want to be seen. Yes, but do I see the world? Do I see the others? It’s working. What is working? - Isabell´s new cam. I saw her on the net. - OK. Mom was not at her desk. Same thing yesterday. I think she really could call sometime when she’s not working. Who is this Isolde anyway? A woman who like to dance, just a innocent pleasure. A woman who also likes being watched while dancing. She sees herself with the men´s eyes. She loves being craved by men, she likes to seduce. all cocks pointed at her, no man being safe. A straightforward life, I got you under my spell. Yes, that was her. I say Goodbye to her. This game is too cold and lonesome. Something sneaks out of me, searching and getting room. I’ve been at the Wannsee today, by myself. A man spoke to me and for the first time, I recoiled. Not HIM on top of all. I looked at him intensively. I told him I was on a quest. But not for a man, but on a quest for me. And he would disturb me on this. He should pardon this. He answered: "I just turn back and leave you alone". I saw rage in his eyes. For a moment I thought he would beat me. I left this game. It’s getting dangerous. Shall I continue to undress? - Yes, please. The slip too? Yes! So... do you like me? You’re the most beautiful girl in the whole world. Just a moment! Someone’s knocking. I guess it’s my father who wants to tell me to turn off the PC. See you tomorrow! You can come in! What did you do? Don’t be that curious, little sister! - Did you tell her that you love her? Piss off! - Or did you jerk off? I once knew a man who was a relative of mine, some kind of cousin. His dream was to surround all his women and kid on an island in the south He dreamt that all his women and kids would celebrate him and he dreamt of Paradise. He dreamt the kids would sit at his feet playing, the women would take a stroll, all laughing and talking about him and waving to him from far away. Just him. And they would all get along with each other very well and love him. He dreamt of enjoying this spectacle, sitting on a hill, drinking Martini, enjoying this spectacle in front of him with all his women and kids. If I would be him, it would HAVE BEEN my dream, too. Hi Venus, the stuff you wrote yesterday was a little too mystical. The ZEIT (magazine) would not be amused. Maybe you should think it over. Bernhard is getting nervous. Keep on with the work. Pluto. PS: I’m on your side! I don’t think while I’m writing Neither do I think about the ZEIT. You should know that by now. Venus talking! That’s a good title. Much better than: The Adventure. All the stuff Venus is writing right now is mystical Artsy Fartsy. You’re always so impatient! My client suggests to pay a compensation at this phase. We will finish the contract before there will be an even bigger damage done, and will pay 100.000 Marks cash right now. My client got the money with him. In return, I’d like to ask you to sign this paper. No! 200.000! But I’d have to give you a cheque, too. No! She really can narrate, I’m sure. Like a lightning! She thinks that she’s not thinking about her readers. But she does that. It’s in her blood. At the very beginning she’s lying to herself. But next... she will get to the core. To the point that she really cares about. Do you think I’m burning my money, Bernie? If it’s for Venus, yes! Not at all! You don’t seem to understand all this. 200.000 Marks! You know: if you wanna win, you have to take a risk sometimes. Give me the number of her fax machine. On my behalf... If you can’t prevent talking to her... Cold feet? If my shareholders notice about this game, we will be down the hill the day after tomorrow, and I have lost 70 millions. Right, now you only have to write. Are you able to do that? Maybe I don’t know about PCs, but I’m not stupid! Well... and which button do I have to push to send off the letter? It’s not a letter, it’s an email. I will do that for you. But I want to be able to do that myself. You push here... Like this? Thanks and bye! Dear Venus, I’m thinking about you a lot. Franz still betrays me, but the worst thing is that he lies to me. That can’t be good, right? I adore you, you never lie. All people should be like that. Biggie (this is the mail from Biggie to Venus that was just send to her) Great. Great! Unique! Besides... you are the most professional author I ever met. And you...you are... ...you are... - A fantastic woman, right? I have trust in you. - That’s fine, Bernhard. And if you want to, I’ll do a contract with you for... 10 Movies! We should go home now, I guess. - Right. May I...may I pay please? - Let me do it. I’ll also do the driving, otherwise your license will be gone tomorrow. Thanks! May I sleep at your place tonight? I just want to sleep... Are you nuts? You’ll be dead if you fall. A goddess lives in danger! Stop it! ( incomprehensible french) The neighbours want to sleep. Can’t you be a little more supportive? I’m sleeping... - Yeah! It’s OK... Don’t make it so hard for me! Would you mind if I lay my arm around you like this? If necessary. I’ll sleep better this way. Not me! Now I’m fine. I’ll be asleep in a minute. That’s great! It’s so cosy. Besides, I’ll seep better when I’m laying on the side... Good night! Wake up! You have to get up immediately. I have to show you something. Is it necessary? YES! You have to get there and tell her that she can’t do this. If a classmate would see this... I won’t go to school anymore. Your mother doesn’t want any disturbance while writing a book. I will go there. All men love Mommy. Turn off the PC. How could you be that cool? - I’M NOT COOL! Why didn’t you sleep with me? Have I been too drunk? You haven’t been drunk. I just did not feel like it. I don’t believe you. I hate to be told lies. What’s up? Nobody phones me here. It might be Hans. Yes! It’s for you... Hello! - You’re shameless! We’ll meet this evening at Amore. Do you have any idea what to tell the the kids about this? 8 p.m.! I want to sleep with you. I didn’t know they placed a web cam at my bed, too. It all happened without my knowledge. Did you use a condom at least? Not the first time. I wasn’t prepared to anything. After that I have used one. What will you do if you are pregnant from him? I didn’t think about that. We can talk about it if it should happen. You have gone crazy! Do you really want to discuss with me about being pregnant from another man? YOU wanted to talk about it. That doesn’t matter. What shall I say to Thorsten? The truth! I hate you. Got a cigarette? I don’t smoke. Or a buck? You’re not very entertaining. What do you need the money for? The whole buck? I planned to buy me a flat with that. Could I sleep at your place tonight? What’s your age? I don’t want to fuck you, I just need a place to sleep. You could be my daughter. You look quite good for that. Want a drink? 2 Scotch please! I NEVER cheated! I stayed at home while she worked on her career! I stayed with the kids at night. I corrected more English essays than I could think of. WHY IS SHE DOING THIS? Just kick her out! - Yes, I would do that! You won’t! Why not? When did you come home last night? 2 hours ago. I don’t want you watch that web cam again. Did you understand? OK. The page is a big success. Over 1000 hits a day and uncountable mails I’m happy and proud of you. P Today at 4 p.m. at the Red Rose Cafe. If you don’t come, I’ll stop writing. Why didn’t you dye them a little more flashy? Your web cam just arrived today. You can use the other watering can. I want to drive to Berlin next weekend. - But not to Mom! Isabell invited me. I can sleep at her place. Her mother approved. But not in the same bed. - Daddy! Franz wants the divorce. Just in case! Not needed. Hi. How are you? Great! Everything is just great. I got it, just take a look! - I can see you. I can see you! Now it’s you turn to undress. But anybody can see it. - I did, too. If you don’t do it, it’s the end. You won’t be allowed to visit me. I don’t marry a coward! That’s blackmail! OK? - Now you may come. What about this? I swear... it all happened against my will. Am I supposed to believe this, Pluto? This man is a...PC genius. You PC genius is just a perverted wanker. Nothing more! They ALL are like that more or less. Of course you got some ideas about what is possible with these web-cams. But I never... NEVER... This was our last book project. I’ll sack him. Today! Do as you like. Venus, the stuff you wrote.. is genius Bernie is so happy, he could cry. My last one, Hans. I’ll promise. SHIT! I’m in love with you. I know. I don’t want to live without you. This is our last day. - Why? Because from tomorrow on, I have to write non stop, without any disturbances. I already told you. - What? The reason I dislike books. Do you think I selling myself? - No. I’m not that sure. How about going to your place? Sorry, that’s not possible. I see. I’m sorry. I have to get some flowers for your mother. Great! First at home, then... ...I’ll show you some places in Berlin, and then my favorite disco. You have to be home at 1 a.m.! - That’s the hour it just gets started! 1:30! Thorsten has never been here, so he knows nothing at all. Furthermore, I want to be his guide. But your cellphone will be left on and you know that I... ...can’t sleep before you are back home. Mrs. Neumann, you can count on me. We will be back at 2:00 precisely. Ass kisser! What’s up? I don’t know. I’m feel like being watched all the time around here. No wonder in this glasshouse. What? You installed that cam. You are fired! Right now! Do you understand? I do! Wanker! Shit! I think I have to sleep now. Shit. I’m thinking about my kids all the time. It feels like they would be with me, in this room. Do you sleep? - No. Can I sleep here? Embrace me. Will we never meet again? - Who knows? I don’t think so. Will Mom stay with us? Who knows? Hello! Everything OK? Can you help me? subs by musiclova 05/2018
