GRAPES Pleased to meet you, John Ogle. Please, do come in. Leave your shoes on. That's fine. I've had two clients here already but haven't had any comeback yet, so, first come first served. Here is the living-room. The wife's away on a business trip and it's all down to me. 80 square metres. All been renovated. The neighbours are hunky-dory. With the wife we're in some hurry but I don't want to rush you. Come with me, here's the kitchen. It's better for us to have respectable tenants here, which I think applies to you. Just sleeping over really... You know the score, loads of work. But a beautiful view... Not such good visibility today. Rent is 20000 monthly all inclusive. And what's in there? Larder... - Larder? - To lather in the bathroom. Renovated only recently, so it's in fine nick. But the price remains the same. 30000 to reserve it. We're in a bit of a hurry, so first come first served! - We're game. - Excellent. Here is the reservation contract. Please read it through properly. Reserve payment when you sign, as I mentioned on the phone... - Is there a cat here? - A cat? No. - Husband is allergic to cats. - I see. I'd appreciate a week to move out. Then I'll ring you. Don't you have the keys? Here are the keys. My pleasure, and I hope you'll be happy here. Let's do a runner! Stop! Pussy! Stop! Police! - Bugger me, how did they find us? - Not sure, I was real careful. Get rid of the cat! Next time we'll swap. You'll pull the birds and I'll sell their flats. Damn it, the money! Leave them be! Police! Stop! Climb back then. Just tell me how they found us? They must have followed you! Followed me? Crap. Although I've seen that smaller one today somewhere already. I think this is yours. Let's get a bite to eat, I'm starving. Hello, we're part of the catering staff, collecting glasses. This is grand. - I told you we'll get some grub. - Loads of art... Anyroad, we should switch it round. You teach me to sell flats and I'll teach you how to get round women. I'm getting tired of them anyhow. But find yourself a single one to make it easier for me. Are you the artist responsible? I had no idea, you're so young. I am not the author. Are you dumb? She was all yours. Sufficed to mention a few wise words about the photos. Let's try again. Excuse me. A bit of feta? Feta... Excuse me, a bit of camembert? This is Liza. Just started to learn to ride. - This is John... - The author. - Really? You were taken by my conceptual vision of the space? Only the most sensitive of souls really appreciate it. Do you wish to buy one of the photographs? I'd bet the corner is one for you - "Lover In the Dark". - I see. You mean "Ovulation"? - Sorry? You see, gents, I'm the curator of the exhibition. The artist is there. And over there is the exit... Nice to have met you. It was better. The largest Australian city... Grand-dad! Hiya, cousin-baby. My, my, a guest comes running, time to hide the family silver. - Grand-dad, I thought that... - No way, I was wide awake. I've just visited Australia. Hang on, where do I know you from? - I've seen you somewhere before. - I've brought you something. What is it? Tapiz. Argentina. Prague has spoiled you rotten. One tries hard to make something of you and it's all for nought. - What have you got here? - What? - What are you planning? It's... just for me to see the places I've been to. - And here? - Spot to leave the pins. But hang on, wait... I needed something from you. Just I can't remember what. I've written it here... Using a pencil... Except I don't know where. Sit straight at the dinner-table. No stooping, elbows by the side. You mustn't cross your legs and arms raised above the table-top. We do not bite the bread but break it into small pieces, daintily placing in the mouth... Just listen to grand-dad. We'll be back by dinner, all right? Come back earlier, there's a storm brewing. Y'know we have to keep up with the world, follow new trends. Snails, for example, have to be eaten with a two-pronged fork - whose tips point downwards. - SOCIAL CATECHISM Pig-slaughter blood soup for lunch. I know now what I wanted. You'll deliver some wine in Prague. To make sure you're of some use. Come, we'll look at the cassettes. - Clare has brought some new ones. - Who's Clare? Oh, a deaf old bat. Come on. Where have you put your drugs? - I hope I haven't wasted my time. - What? Where have you left your medicines? You have to take them regularly. Aren't they somewhere under there? Where under? There's nothing here. Right down? At the bottom? The doctor will check on it later anyway. Here they are! You've to put them where you can see them. My name is John. Grand-dad... I'm his grand-son. I've just arrived from the big smoke. There's nothing left! You must have taken them. See, I completely forgot. Here, put it over there! - You have to start writing it down. - Get away. The doctor said I'll kick the bucket soon, so, there's no point. - Do you visit often? - What about you? I come now and then. Whenever grand-dad needs something. I'm from Prague, see. I heard that you turn up once-a-year if he's lucky. When you need something leave me a message. Ciao. A really kind lass, but doesn't take much of a shine to us Praguers, get it? Look, she's brought me another cassette, my luscious berry - about Argentina by chance. Sonnie, I'd really like to take a look over there. Maybe in the next life. PARLIAMENT OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC - Good morning. - Good morning. - I'm here to see Mr. Boucek. Hang on, the deputy will be along soon. Good morning, Mr. Ad?mek. I keep thinking of your grand-dad. - That Riesling of his! Is that it? - Yes. Brilliant that you've brought it all the way here. Millie, fax this wee piece and make sure it's booked, OK? Always on the go flying off. What the heck when the State pays. - Where do you go to? - It depends. Right now to Singapore. For ten days. Here is the money for the wine. See you. But they're all formal meetings. I hardly take off my suit. - What is your job? - I have a wine shop in Prague. That's super. Here is my card. - I'm sorry I'm just out of them. - Just leave your number then. Hello? Good morning, sir. Christ, you're right! Briefcase... Yes, it's mine. Of course I'll pick it up. Thank you. Important things in it. Bye, bye, sir. Excuse me. Salami? - Camembert? - Good morning, M?cha is my name. - Good morning. Crow. - What a small world, isn't it? - Do you work in parliament? - I am M.P. Boucek's assistant. - How come you eat here? - The sandwiches are great. I'm always off somewhere. To Singapore with my boss right now. Excuse me! Can you do something with this table? It's wobbly! Hmm... how much do you pay for one plane ticket? 200000 for First Class. But you know I don't get to enjoy it much. With all those meetings... In a suit all day long. 200000? Such a waste of State resources? Look here, I work for a travel agency. If you want I'll get one for 100000... Really? Very interesting. Where do you fly to? All over. Africa. Asia. America. Here is my card. I'm sorry I'm right out. - Good afternoon, Mrs. M?lkov?. - Mr. Hawk, the landlord said that if you don't pay the rent he will cut off the electricity. More like the water, Mrs. M?lkov?. - What are you doing here? - You know the water is off? - How did you get in? - The window! That lamp is super! That will work on the ladies. Romantic... - I don't recollect inviting you. - I must get one. Do you hear me? Sorry, couldn't stay at home. Fuzz were waiting. The cops? Hawk? Again a bird's name. Bloke must be an ornithologist. THRUSH, SWALLOW, CROW, PIGEON, HAWK It's becoming too hot for us. We have to split. - Where to? - Somewhere they can't find us. But we'll have to get hold of some cash first. Get packed. - Pack what? - Get a move on! - I've nothing to pack here. Stop! Jerry, they're off! Stop or... Sod it... - What were you up to? - What d'you think? Splashed myself. - You want to get some cash here? - Wait! The Deputy isn't here yet. I know but last time I left my briefcase here. Thank you. PARLIAMENT OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC REQUEST Good afternoon, I am Deputy Boucek's assistant. Can I use your fax? We have a problem with our one. - Hey, where are we off to? - You'll see! - But we have no money! - Don't worry about that. - That's my grand-dad. - Grand-dad? You've got a grand-dad? Hi! When I went to see my old lady, or some other lass, get it, I brought along three bottles. One for her, to get the wench relaxed, and the other two for me for some Dutch courage. Grand-dad, this is George. We work together in Prague. - We've come for a little holiday. - Welcome, Georgie. Come on. Not for me, thanks. My stomach is too acidic. Is it possible? Is that at all possible? My grandson doesn't drink wine. Joseph, did you hear that? All right then... One more grape-harvest and I'll sell up. And I'll die, I'm telling you! Who'll look after it all? Not you likely. And anyway... Where is the money for the wine that I gave you last time? - You blew it, didn't you? - Didn't blow it. - Oh yes, you blew it! - Didn't blow it. - Blew it! No giving lip back to grand-dad! Blew it. I have a surprise for you. You know when you said that in the next life you fancied visiting Argentina... You can manage it this week. I bought you a tour. For you and for Joseph. Excursions included. You've lost your marbles in Prague. Grape-harvest is in one month. According to the forecast weather will be fine for at least a month. - We'll take care of it meantime. - You mean, you two? You've no idea about grape-harvests. And this slob? You want to sit and wait? Nothing going on in the vineyard anyway. You'll fly off to Argentina and be back in no time. You won't have to watch the video. You'll see it with your own eyes. And I'll watch over things. Nothing will happen. I promise. This must have cost a packet... And I've never flown in a plane before. See then! Neither have I. Fits like a glove. You have to represent us. Like the Kennedy brothers. Do you remember, John? You were nearly born in this car. No, I don't remember. I wanted something else. I've written it somewhere... You're not coming with us? - I'll rather wait here. - Yep, I've remembered now! If anything goes wrong here... You've run dry? Praguers wouldn't give a toss. We have to help each other. Ain't I right, sonnie? - Aye, auldjin, you're right. - Where's ye off to then? Just came from a wee way back. I have a vineyard hereabout. - A vineyard? And I don't ken yous? - I'm not totally local. - I commute. - How you doing Moravian? - Hi, Clare, what a coincidence. - Grand-dad safely in the plane? I ken, you're the Prague John? He entrusted you with the vineyard? Fuck me, what a mad old goat. - I'll manage. - I'm Jimmy, her dad. There's one fewer in our clan than all Chinese put together. Clare, escort him so our Praguer doesn't lose his way. Well, won't let you perish here. Quite a chance we met up. It's lovely here. Vineyards all around... A chapel or chateau there... Really nice. - Drop me off here. - Here? - You live here? - No, it's my boyfriend's B&B. - CLARE'S GUEST-HOUSE - Pretty original. It will come in handy when your Praguers come for a tasting. Praguers? What Praguers? The coach that's coming to your grand-dad on Friday. - Nobody told you? - Must have slipped his mind. Thanks for the ride. Yep, he's a beer drinker. But if she loves him... Pop in sometime. We'll have a chat. What have you concocted, Mr. Kozderka? Red or white? No, young unfermented... I hope he actually uses grapes, our crazy chemist! A beaut of a hideaway. Your brains worked overtime. I also know where we can go once we get hold of some cash. To the seaside, I've mates there. So many birds on the beach that you don't have time for a scratch. - I thought you were tired of them. - Yeah, but I know the cause of it! SMOKING MAKES YOU IMPOTENT - Try these ones then. - SMOKING CAN KILL Thanks. Hello, Johnnie. You don't remember me, do you? I am Kozderka, the neighbour. I've brought you some young wine to taste. - My own production. - Thank you, Mr. Kozderka! - Vintage wine. - Vintage? Grand-dad off on holiday, hey? That's good. He told me that he wants to sell up after the harvest. - Did he say for how much? - He didn't say. - Hmm... And how much would you be prepared to pay, Mr. Kozderka? Me? A million at the most. That's grand! A million... That seems rather too little. You see whether he finds a better buyer. Cheers. Don't seal the bottles. The young wine is still working away. Bye! Hey, what if we looked after the sale for grand-dad? I think he'd be pleased with us. - Aren't we real estimate experts? - You mean real estate. No fear, we'll sell this wine business for loads more! So, this is your plan? You want to sell it? I'll show you how to sell. Who is the biggest winemaker in the district? You're lucky my mobile seems to have taken a day off. Otherwise I have to get up at three in the morning. Pinot - a super 'vino', late harvest, New Mountain vineyard. Fuck me, whoever hasn't drunk 10000 litres of wine is no vinter. I drink two litres a day and I'm in fine fettle. The cardiac centre in Brno is writing a study about me. Liver as new! - Never drunk such grand 'vino'! - Pinot! This is a large winemaking business, isn't it, Mr. Michalica? - You can bet your arse on it. - Don't you want to expand? John's grand-dad will be selling up. Lovely windows to the south. Nice and cosy. Yeah well. Wine needs cold as well. This is the P?lava grape. Lovely. It's balanced out sweetly. Very nice. A lovely property, insulation, ventilation, drainage. Simply wonderful. I think grand-dad would give you a discount, sell it at an interesting price. Maybe around two million, right? Maybe uncle Frank would buy grand-dad's winery. If you went over to visit him I'd give you some wine to take. In property better to be cautious. We're not going anywhere today. Pity. They have a folk-dance in the evening. Our Clare is helping out. A knees-up? Well, I suppose we could... Bit more Sauvignon up your mignon. You'll jive and sing along with our luscious berries so you can fucking well see what fine culture we have here. Thanks for the advice and good day to you. Drive carefully lads. Drunk driver - jolly murderer. You can drive for a change! Christ, overtake him, there's nothing coming! You mean that juggernaut? Did you see? What a wanker. We must have reached Moravia. Sir, come over here. Can you tell me where this is? - Where yous from? - What? Where's you from? - What? - Where from? You mean where we come from? No time to chat, we're the police. - Can you tell us where this is? - Hmm, the police... Now then laddie... that ways. No need for you to come back! - Stop! - OK. - Stop I tell you! - All right. - Reverse back there! - No problem. It'll catch up. - Hi, where you off to? - Nowhere, why? Just asking. You want to join us? Off to Frank's place to a dance. Sing, drink and be merry. Know what they say, drunk driver - jolly murderer. I'll drive. It's no great shakes but you can squeeze a bit of juice out of it. You have to familiarise yourself. To feel the life under the bonnet. Then you can fly in it. Clare, a bit under the weather? You seem a bit sad. - Anything up? - Not really. - Shall we have a dance later? - You know how? I'll learn if need be! Brake! The wine's up the spout! I'll drive instead for a while. It'll stink inside! We should clean it out. Look, at least the young wine has survived. Can you smell it? - Cabernet. - Shiraz. Damn it, cops! What should I do? - Drive on. - Be sensible. Local ones are nice. Sure, but I stink as if I've had a swim in a barrel! - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. Road check. Licence and insurance please. Any consummation of alcohol before or during your journey? - No. None. - None... Then, sir, please blow into the tester. Here we go. Not bad but you have to blow harder. Drive on. Poor buggers. How well do you know her? - Just a little bit. - Had anything with her? - No, she has a boy-friend. - Each one fancies a lay. Look! We have a visitor. Olle! Olle! Come on, Olle! - Better not provoke him. - Don't worry. Why, the chickenshit is backing away. But a ram always backs away before forging ahead. Will you give us a push? - Hello, auntie! - Hi, Clare! Welcome! What happened? The wines didn't survive the railway crossing. No matter, the main thing is that you are all all right. Joe, will you have a look at it for them. We have a folk dance, so, I hope you'll stay, OK? - Come on then... - You're in luck. I know this make really well. Motor... Got you! Arrived just in time. Frank has has just finished in the vineyard. He spends days there. - Sauvignon. - Late harvest. You'll taste blackcurrants, gooseberries and peaches. We first examine the aroma, then colour and lastly the taste. - This must be a big winery. - That it is. It's nice and cool here. Great for such a wine-cellar. - Praguers? - Hmm. - Nice. What if we went to have a peep at the vineyard? Maybe lads would be interested. What about it, Frank? Welschriesling. Traminer. Sauvignon. Chardonnay. P?lava. Neuburg. Lemberger. Blauer Portuguese. St. Laurent. It only seems that it is simple. You have thieves who come to pick. Hail that destroys it. Sparrows. - What use are sparrows? - Bugger all use. - Can I have a look, it's... - For sparrows. They're here almost constantly. They form entire professional sparrow armies, but you can only shoot at a flock of a minimum of 1000. Just recognise it has that many. How many are in this flock? A thousand. Shit, it was loaded. So, you're staying then. You're in luck. I know this make really well. Do you have anything else to change into? No worries, we'll find something. Won't let you in wearing this! - It all looks the same. - Vines everywhere. - Mister, come here! - Whyever for, sonnie? We need to ask you something. Ask away. Hang on will you! Let them come over. Where you going? Hello. Do you know by any chance where this is? Hold it up for me. Forget it. You're on duty. You, Martin, are a green tree... Old man, when I get married I'll come here for my honeymoon. I promise! We're off for a shoot! Christ, I'm thirsty. Will you bring something over? There's an awful queue. They did say folk-costumes have priority at the bar. You're from the Ad?mek clan? - How come you don't drink wine? - I get heartburn. You have to find a wholesome lass, sleep with her, and in a short while it will be gone. An exchange of energy. I know it well. I had it too. I see. How do I recognise that she is wholesome? First thing in the morning she pours herself a glass of wine. Can you see her? She's sexy in that gear. I wonder how it gets undone? There'll be a button or zip of some kind. It's a lace-up. Comes off really awkwardly. - Fancy a dance? - You'll fill in for me? Great guy. - Do you fancy a dance? - Sure thing. That outfit suits you. Before we left I had to check grand-dad's suitcase. - Do you know what I found? - What? Diving goggles! You get it? At his age... I can't even remember ever seeing him swim! Question is whether he actually swims as I taught myself. - Who taught you to swim? - What? - Who taught you to swim? - Dad. Didn't yours do the same? No. My parents died when I was little. I didn't know. Sorry. In a thunderstorm. I hardly remember them. I was really very small. Why did you stop seeing grand-dad? Don't know. Vines aren't my thing. I never fancied it much. But it may be that I will get more of a kick out of it now. Clare! What are you doing here? You should be inside. - Just in time, hey? - Hi. Come on then. Let's go inside. You've suffered enough here. Come on! Let's go! Let her be. Why you sticking your nose in? - You can't force her, right? - What are you playing at? I've fixed it for you. A new radiator, hoses, seals... Just don't know where this goes. You see his wife? She's looking dandy, hey? I think I love her. What a woman! What a pair of luscious berries! - Go easy, she's married. - But she does have a super hubbie. I danced with her until dawn. Have to strike when the metal's hot. When I get a leg-over I'll sell them the wine business, you'll see! What beauty. Look at it. Those colours. The air. Sublime! Whyever did we get stuck in Prague! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Grape-picking already? - Yep, harvest is here... AD?MEK'S VINICULTURE - What's up? - They were picking our grapes. What? - This is grand-dad's vineyard! - Hey? - Crikey, they cleared both rows! - What? - What do you want to do about it? - I've nothing against thieves but when it's my property involved no holds barred. Wait, you don't know how to use it. Take something, we'll see to them! We have to follow the world. Be aware of new trends. Come here. Write a wish on that wee balloon. - Grand-dad, I want back home. - No backchat with grand-dad! Write a wish, but make sure I don't see it. MUM Bend your knees... Straighten up... Legs a bit apart, main thing don't look where the balloon flies to, otherwise you won't hit it! This year will be a sound one. Leave it alone! I'm armed! Stop! Not a step further! Yous aiming for a rabbit? Turn right, straight and down the stairs. It's a fine whoopee here. YOUNG WINE - How much of it? - Twenty. Excellent! Great! They sorted you out proper! Sorry, I had to see Maggie last night. Hubbie was seeing off the sparrows, so, I had to help the family out. Did you ever get have it off in a vineyard? - Bloody hell, marvellous... - Kozderka. I know. He steals grapes from all and sundry. The earth moved. That's not a woman but a typhoon, tornado, nay a hurraycane. - Hurricane. - Take a grip. You'll get a rash. Get up! Pull yourself together. A full bus of Praguers is here in a moment. We have to organise the tasting and a party later at the guest-house. Clare and Charlie have prepared some refreshments. This will put you on your feet. - What if it's the kidneys? - We'll be selective. If it bowls you over then it's the kidneys. If not it's lumbago. - Good afternoon. - Good... Do you see the creep? Ad?mek? Where-ever can that be? Don't you fancy my place? I have some young wine. We're here! Over here! I know him. If need be remember I have a wine-shop in Prague. Good afternoon, Mr. Ad?mek. I didn't expect you here. - Where is grand-dad? - Off on holiday right now. So, it's all down to you then? I'm looking forward to it. - lf you please. - Good afternoon. With wine we analyse the bouquet, then colour and lastly taste. Aroma isn't very noticeable. So we twirl. It's Welschriesling. It's opened up a little and become rounder, and we sense a flowering meadow, breeze among dandelions, some violets and, of course, primroses. We can see a fine bronze reflection I consider that this wine has an acceptable possibly bashful taste. Somewhat mysterious. Almost provocative. - As if it said: uncover me. - What is it's ideal temperature? 9 to 11 degrees centigrade. Now we'll try the Chardonnay. - Where is he? - Who? - That bastard! Frank! Please wait! It's not worth it! Nobody in there. Put down that weapon! That prissy Prague twit won't be dossing down with my wife! Frank, please, let it be! Come out, you swine! You hear me, come out! Hi. I'll find the scoundrel! I'll break every bone in his body! - George! - Has he gone? Bugger me, that was close. Not such a super hubbie after all. I should do a runner... The sea is calling. I've arranged the sale with Maggie, just grab the money and come to see me. - I can't. I won't sell up. - Do me a favour! It's all agreed with Maggie. Take the dosh and come after me. I won't wait until morning for that madman to return. I'll call when I get there. Then we'll have one big binge! See you... YOUNG WINE Welcome to the Kozderka family. Can you sense that aroma? Come, come. That's honey and lime-blossom. If you're empty-handed take a glass and we'll do some tasting. I'll sell as much as you want. I'll fill it up into these bottles. Be careful not to close too firmly. Young wine is working all the time! Must make sure it doesn't get angry on the coach. - Mr. Kozderka? - Yes? It looks as if somebody was inside the barrels. Get up! Weather has turned! Have to finish picking before the rains. Fuck, stop gaping at God's works, get stuck in at the vineyard, so you can save grand-dad some of it! You know of anybody able to help me? You don't have anybody? That's like praying after the event. Hey, what's that there? Good afternoon, checking documents. Your licence and insurance please. Did you drink any alcohol before or during your journey? - Gone mad, we're cops like you! - Like us? Not sure about that. I'd be grateful if you would complete an alcohol test for us. There ain't going to be any alcohol testing. - Give me back my ID or else! - Or else? Are you threatening me? Leave it out! We're not normal, we're the police. - Can't you see? Look! - Police? I see. Get out of the vehicle. Both, if you wouldn't mind. - Get out! You'll come with us. - Now then! Give back the ID! You oaf, come here with it... Ahh! What's he doing? Ahh! Bastards! - Here is your ID, take it! - Wastrel! Amateurs! Damn it, the cuffs are a bit tight. Are yours tight? Hi. Dad said to bring some men and give you a hand. Grand-dad is back tomorrow night. I'd like to make sure the red young wine is passable. You think you'll manage it alone? You might fall asleep. Fermentation snuffs up the oxygen and you could suffocate. But I also have to pick him up at the airport. What's this here? What can it be? These corks my grand-dad used to put in before the 90's. Selection of grapes? It's the best I've ever drunk. Won't Charlie be looking for you? - Fire! - Crikey! Hi, Jimmy, John speaking. Wait, no... Grand-dad is arriving so I thought that you might pick him up at the airport, right? I'm taking care of the young wine, it'll be ready any moment. I thought you could make it if you put your foot down. Fine. Thanks very much. So, we've finally managed it. You'll come with us Mr. Hawk, Rook, Willow, Tittlemarsh. Thrush! - Where then is your grand-dad? - He's on holiday. - Coming back this evening. - You'll miss him then. You'll stay with us awhile. - How did you get that? - Probably an allergy. - Hang on, I'll give you something. - Thanks. Gentlemen, have you ever drunk young red wine? It exists? - We haven't and we won't. - Red young wine is medicine. It only survives a few hours, so, if you aren't careful you'll get to taste it the next year. I expect him any time now. But if I accompany you grand-dad won't get to taste it. He's ill. Likely that this is his last young red wine he will ever taste. He slaved all year in order to be able to taste it. Look, wait with me until the evening. I won't run, nowhere to go. Now we've finally caught up with you? Not a chance. Well, we could hang on until the evening, couldn't we? In any case, only problems await us back in Prague. Not because of me it ain't. I had no desire to fight. - It was just standard procedure. - Sure thing! Ahh! Show me where it hurts. Here? - I know. That's the gall-bladder. - Gall-bladder you say? I have something here for it. I always let myself be talked round. I can forget about bonuses. There are loads of things you have to take care of here. Like thieves getting hold of your grapes. Sparrows pecking the lot. Hail threatening to destroy it all. Then there are a variety of fungi. And if it starts to rain and you don't manage to harvest it it's saturated by water. In any case, I think forbidding alcohol behind the wheel turns logic upside down, against motoring principles. Why, if I am driving I am going to see somebody, right? And logically if I am going to see somebody then, logically, I want to have a glass or two with him. - Like Welschriesling... - Don't like Welsh things. You can drink it all the time but Rulander fills you up with aromas making sure you can't taste anything the next day. I'll have a peep at that red to see if it's almost ready. Red young wine is the best drink that you can imbibe. That's why it has such short duration. Johnnie, if the flame gets smaller then run away quick as young wine gobbles up oxygen and you could suffocate! Secure the evidence, call in the Crime Scene Unit, complete the odour test. It's stopped! It's gone! You were right. That's it. We have red young wine ready. What time can it be? - Grand-dad... - Johnnie... Just in time. Red young wine for you. What? Already? Is that possible? These are my friends from Prague. Jerry and Mitch. - They came to see me. - Welcome, lads... - Good evening. - You're Jerry? - Mitch. - So you're Mitch. - No, I'm Jerry. Just need to know what you're about! Sure! By the way, where were you grand-dad? Just down the road, in Argentina. To see with Joseph how it's done over there. Friends, I must tell you they still have things to learn. Cheers. Laddies, young wine is there to be drunk not sniffed. Lovely... Really lovely. I see my wait has been worth it.
