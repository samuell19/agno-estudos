BAR GLORIA'S TAVERN Come on now, look. Excuse me... Have you heard of a plot called Las Agustinas? So, you're taking a trip... You girls shouldn't be all alone down here... What's your problem, little shit? Hey, hey! What's your problem? Our problem... ... is that that's no way to talk to us. And why would that be? Because that's not the way things are done around here. Straight ahead... ... in five minutes you'll find the end of the road. Okay. Thank you. - Let's go. - Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. Where are you from? From Santiago, are you from here? Yep.

That way, your finger can have another friend. - Thank you. - Hey, why are you so alone here? Where do you live? My dad works there. Hey... Take care, okay? And be careful with balls here. Bye. Since when do you have such a sweet side? What? I’m all sweetness. - Where did those puppets come from? - My boyfriend gave them to me. They’re cute, aren’t they? Meh... This place isn’t for women, you see. - Yeah, we already realized. - Yes, we almost got raffled in there. Yes, but don’t worry too much. They’re not bad people. It’s just that they’re not used to seeing... women like you. "Like us"? How so? "Like you"; cute. What’s your... your name? - Pedro. - Pedro. We’re a little late. And we’d better get going. Okay. We understand, we understand. The truth is... what’s important is that we’re here for you girls, whatever you need - Thank you. - "Here for you"; not "here for you girls". - Funny... - Which way are you headed? Near here, to Las Agustinas. Where’s that? Are you family members? Yes. I am. I’m Gustavo’s niece. Alright. So I’ll get out of your way. If anything comes up, call us. - Yes. - We’re almost the only police force in town I’ll write my number down for you, do you have a piece of paper? - No, no. - No, but... ...it’s not necessary, I don’t think anything will happen. Let’s see, come over here. It’s been years since someone has written something on... ... on my arm. Well, there it is. Alright then. - Alright... - Thank you. - See you. - See you. Hopefully not! What was that? - What? - Oh, don’t play dumb... ...”The patrolman of love”? Get in the car... Hey... Who’s that Gustavo? A guy that has lots of money... ... but he hasn’t been seen around here in years. Soto... ... don’t be such a ladies’ man. - Let’s go? - Let’s go. So green! It's so big! Dude, it's gorgeous. It’s so beautiful. - Yes. It looks the same. It’s awesome. How long since the last time you guys were here? - I don’t know, about... - A bunch. ... three or four years? But I didn’t come with Cami that time. Right, no, she came with a guy and then he completely ignored her back in Santiago Chill out, I’m just kidding. ...It is time to rest. To rest! - Hey! - Yes! Enough already with the cellphone! Enough with the phone! I’ll hide it here so you can... ... go look around, breathe in the air... ... hey, Cami, come here. What is it? Nothing. Look, I happen to have a piece of paper so I can... - ... take this off. - What’s wrong with it? Nothing’s wrong, but why would you...? I want for us to be okay, alright? - Don’t be inappropriate, Andrea, please. - Why? Why would you say that? I want for us to have a good time. - You’re so annoying. - Why? - Hey... - Huh? - What’s that? - Oh, it’s a surprise... ... wanna come with me? Look, look, look! So beautiful! Hey, and who takes care of all this? A local family, they manage to clean the place... ...watch this, take care of the house. But the birds don't all seem to be doing that well... Oh, no, how sad. There's always one that dies... Grab it like a man! Do what I taught you! Do it! - Where’s my baby? - Shut up! Where is he? Shut up, God damn it! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - Shut up! - Where is he? Where...? Alright. - The wine’s here, who want’s some more? - I do. - Please. - Let’s see, let’s see. - You want some? - Yes. Come on, Magda, tell us. What’s up with your Master’s Degree? - What’s it about? - The Master’s Degree? It’s all about network management, all that stuff that you just love. What do you mean? You don’t like it? Yeah... What do you mean, "yeah"? You’re talking like you’re not motivated at all. Yeah, I don’t know, I feel like it’s kind of overpriced... ... and also it’s mostly Nico who’s motivating me to do it. - And who’s Nico? - Her boyfriend. And how long have you been together? A year... a year. And you’re going to listen to someone you’ve been seeing for just a year? Why would you say that? Nico supports her... ... he’s a good boyfriend. - It’s kind of inappropriate. - Maybe he’s not trustworthy, I don’t know Listening to someone... so soon... it’s your future, isn’t it? Yeah, but you shouldn’t get involved because you kill her whole vibe. I’m kidding. It was just a joke. Yeah... ...but I still feel like everything he does, he does it so I can help him later. What do you mean, "later"? I don’t know, like, with his company... You see? There it is. Who’s to say you’ll still be together in two years’ time? Whoa, stop, what’s your deal? You always tell me to think about the future, that we’ll always be together... ... all those things. - But that’s different, honey. I honestly don’t see how it’s different, but... Because I always deliver, for starters. You always say that when you want... What? - What do I want? - Alright. Oh, do you have some sort of project? Plans? Yeah, we’re moving in together. Really? Look at that... When? Soon. And how long have you been together? A month? Two months? Six. - Six months, already. - Yes, six and a half months. Oh. I see. And have you told mom? What a pain in the ass. No. What do you mean, "no"? What do you mean? You have to tell her. Later on. The thing is, "later on" she’ll be angry. It’s a matter of respect. - Respect? - Okay, but... my aunt is pretty relaxed, I don’t think she’ll mind if you tell her now. Magda, not to be mean, but stay out of it. Honestly. Shit. Honey... ... don’t treat Magda like that, she didn’t mean anything by it. You know what? I’m going back in the house. But... - But Cami... - Is she fucking with us? Okay... I didn’t want her to feel... ... bad; I thought she was... Take it easy, beautiful. She gets over these things quickly. She’s kind of nuts, but... ... I know her, she’ll get over it. Who knows why she’s acting that way... That’s weird. What did you say? I better go check on her. - Excuse me. - Go on. Why do you dislike her so much? I don’t "dislike" her... ... I detest her. But... But why? Because I know her. I’ve known her for years, I know what she’s like. You’re so bitter. I like her, I think she’s really nice. What did you say? That I’m bitter? I’m bitter? Do you want to see how bitter I am? Do you want to see how bitter I am? Look. - Look how bitter I am. - Ooh, such bitterness. - Let’s see, let’s see. - Bring it on.
