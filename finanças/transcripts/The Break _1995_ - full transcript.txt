[fast tempo suspenseful music] [fast tempo upbeat music] [slow tempo acoustic guitar music] [birds chirping] [gentle brooding music] - [Announcer] And there's Nick Irons hitting a big forehand return in front of a sellout crowd at Wembley Arena. Irons known for his powerful ground strokes and speed was a champion on any surface. - 10 lessons for 300. You got a bargain rate, ma'am. And Nick Irons is a legend. Could play with any of 'em, Connors, Mack, any of 'em. - [Announcer] Crowd pleaser had quite a flare for the game. He showed that flare back in '81 when he took the unbeatable Bjorn Borg. - So do you have the 300? - [Announcer] Three exciting sets at Suntory Invitational in Tokyo, Japan. Irons a self-taught scrapper matched Borg's foot speed. Irons's was a comer and even Borg knew it. But nothing topped his biggest- - You are one lucky kid. You're gonna be learning at the feet of a legend. [remote clicks] - It's kind of funny. - [Beales] What? - That tennis player looks exactly like the guy I saw throwing up on his car outside. [slow tempo acoustic guitar music] [Nick panting] - [Nick] Okay, Arnold, here we go. - His name is Albert. - Right, right, Albert. Here we go, Albert, last three balls, ready? Back swing. Good. Racket back, swing. [Albert grunts] Good. - What's so good? He never hits the ball. - Doesn't matter, it's the form that counts. Okay, Albert, this is the last one. Racket back and swing. [Albert grunts] [racket whooshing] [racket thudding] [Mom sighs] Kid's a natural. - [Radio Host] KWKRP, it's 91 degrees, 85% humidity in Miami. - [Beales] Just a wild guess, Nick, but I'd say you shot a few tequilas last night. - Yep, even ate the worm. - You're late. There's no more bookings today. But I want you here for the walk-in, do you understand? - I'm here. - By the way, I understand that you crashed here a couple of nights last week. Do that again, you're fired. - Coming off the caffeine again Beales, makes you so bitchy. - Don't forget to wash the damn court. [brooding music] [door clicks] [door bangs] [buttons tapping] - This is 426. What's the spread on the Bulls Blazers game? All right, put me down for a nickel on the Blazers. I'll take the points. Also give me a deuce in the over. All right, thanks for your support. [phone clicks] - [Announcer] Results of the 7th race are now official. Number four Daddy's Best was the winner at 8-60 to win, 480 to play, and 320 to show. - Hey, hey, hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey! - Just what I thought, '67 not a '68. [hood thuds] - Hey Mel, how you doing? - Let this car go to shit, didn't you? I used to have one of these myself. Wife got it along with my kid. [chuckles] Hey Nick, listen, Gil wants to talk to you. He's over there. - I'm impressed. That used to be Don Johnson's? - All right, tell him we can handle all the action he's got so long as he stays with the ponies. If he moves over to b-ball tell him we can pull up at say 50 grand a pop. Fair enough? All right, you stay in touch. So you still betting 'em, huh, kid? I thought we had a deal or did you forget? You still owe me 26,000 bucks? [Mel chuckles] - Forget? No, I didn't forget. In fact, I was just on my way of the ATM machine. [hands thud] [Nick grunting] You crazy? - No, you are crazy, Irons. I don't like being conned. You are a worthless little shit with a major problem. - You're right, you're right. Listen, I'll get you the money next week, I promise. - Spare me please, I don't wanna hear. But this could be your lucky day. Come on, I wanna talk to you. See, I think I finally figured out a way how we can solve this problem. I want you to take care of somebody for me. - Wait, wait, wait, Gil, I'm not into guns, not into cement. - Get real, will you? I'm talking about a coaching job. - You mean tennis? - No, football, smart-ass. Of course tennis. See, it's for my young son, Joel. He's only 17. He wants to be a tennis player. Now you know me, I never cared much for the sport guys in little white shorts. It don't seem natural besides people don't bet on it. Anyway, Joel's going on this satellite tour this summer. You know this bush league thing? - Yeah, so? - So his regular coach just quit and I want you to take over. You do this for me, we'll call it even. - Sorry, Gill, it's just not for me. - What do you mean not for you? He's just a kid. It's only for the summer. All you gotta do is look after him. - Hire a nanny. - Wait a second. [Mel grunts] [Nick groaning] - What is your problem? - What are you brain dead? I am offering you an easy way out of this mess, Irons. Besides you're perfect for the job. - Oh yeah, now I'm perfect, how's that? - Because you're the biggest screw up in South Miami, that's why I need you. See Joel, he's got this idea, he can make it in tennis, you know, the big time. - Good luck. - Exactly. He's a million to one shot. And besides that, athletics is not his forte. Figures are his forte. He's got the touch, believe me. And come September, he's gonna have to start working with me. In the meantime, I want you to discourage him. You know, get this fag thing out of his system. - Look, I'll do anything you want. You know, if you want me to make some runs, I'll do it. I'm not going back in that circuit. [fist thuds] [Nick groaning] [body thuds] - You are taking this job, asshole. [Nick panting] - Oh, yeah. - Good boy. You start tomorrow. Here's your expense money. Now listen to me, don't worry about a thing. You just be yourself, you can discourage anyone. I'll be in touch. [announcer chattering] [slow tempo acoustic guitar music] [Nick coughs] [car engine rattling] - [Host] I breathe in, I breathe out. I breathe in, I breathe out. - [Nick] Holy shit. - [Host] I'm a winner regardless of what people say. - Mr. Irons. - [Host] I'm a butterfly. - Wow, it's really a pleasure to meet you, sir. My father's told me a great deal about you. - I love myself. - Is that right? What is that horrible sound? - [Host] My masculine energy. - Oh, those are some relaxation tapes I listen to. - [Host] I don't take flack from anyone. - Well, relaxation time's over. [tape player thudding] Garlic pills? [nose sniffing] This place smells like a goddamn hospital. [window thuds] [weatherman chattering] - Most beautiful day in Orlando today. But thunderstorms from West Palm Beach, Miami down through Naples, the Keys. - The Weather Channel? - Temperatures as far as far as the water can- - It's just a hobby. - Yeah, well before you start showing me your butterfly collection, grab your stuff. Let's go see if you know which end of the racket to hold. [upbeat music] [Joel whistling] Ah! What the hell you think you're doing? - Sorry, it just snapped open. - Well, snap it closed. You almost put my eye out. What are you doing with that thing anyhow? - I heard there's a strong frontal trough coming through. I was just being prepared. - Prepared, Joel? That's a laugh. This is the satellite circuit, you don't get prepared. It's gonna be hot as a bitch all summer. The prize money's shit. And there's a hundred guys out here ready to cut your balls off for a better ranking. So I don't want to hear prepared from a spoiled little prick who probably can't beat a dozen old gray-haired cut shot farts at any country club in America. - Did I hit a nerve? [balls tapping] - [Announcer] Welcome to Orlando. First stop on the satellite tour. All qualifiers must sign it now for the open. - I don't believe my eyes. Nick. - $5 for main- - Nick Irons? - $10 for qualifier. - Dale Farley, the best chair umpire who never saw a baseline. How you doing? - A long time, Nick. I didn't think I'd see you again. But what brings you here? Don't tell me you're attempting a comeback. - No, no, I'm coaching. This is my new pupil, Joel Robbins. Joel, focus in. - Nice to meet, Joel. - [Joel] Nice to meet you too, sir. - Ah, Nick, Joel, I'd like you to meet Delores Smith who's just started working with us. - Delores, that's a beautiful name. My mother's name is Delores. - Really? - Thanks. Just let him know, I'll call him back. Delores, I forgot to give you these. [Jennifer sighs] - [Dale] Ah, Jennifer, come on over here. I guess you'll have to meet him sooner or later. Nick, Joel, this is the new tournament director on the circuit, Jennifer Hudson. - You look great. - [sighs] You look like shit. - Jet lag, long trip for Monaco. - I guess you two know each other. - Tournament director, huh? I thought you'd outgrown the circuit years ago. - [scoffs] It wasn't a circuit that I outgrew. So are you here to play tennis or did you get lost on the way to the track? - Excuse me, Jennifer. You have a phone call inside. - Thank you, Tommy. I have to get that. It's very nice to meet you. And Nick, I'm sure I'll see you lurking around. - Well, this is just like homecoming. We even have a queen. So Delores, you think we can get a practice court? - I'll check. - Uh, that's a waste of time, Delores. Guys, the courts are all booked up. Maybe you should just try again later. - Yeah, well, I see nothing's changed. Thanks anyway. - Thank you. - Whoa. [balls thudding] - Was that an old girlfriend of you as Mr. Irons? - The name is Nick. And when you quit walking into me. You're very annoying. - Sorry. Oh no, there's Brock. - [Nick] Who the hell's Brock? - [Joel] Brock Haynie, I've known him since I was 12. He's the best athlete I ever saw. He's the best at everything. - Yeah. So how bad he beat you? - Nevermind. Let's just say he's on the Future's team and I'm not. - [Man] Brock dog! [racket taps] [Brock grunts] - [laughs] Automatic, baby, automatic. - Oh no, he sees me. - Big deal, act friendly, wave. - Hi Brock. [balls thudding] - Freak. - Ah, nothing is going right. I shouldn't have come out this summer. Can't even get a practice court. - Shut up. We'll get a court. You know, you should be happy with your draw. I mean, Olmedo in the first round. It's not bad. - What are you talking about? - Of course, if you get past him, your second round's a lot tougher. I mean, it could be Tilden, and Tilden, he's no slouch. - Oh no, no, slouch off. In fact, Tilden in the second round, that's a really tough draw. I mean, that's a really tough draw. - Don't push it. - Hey guys, did you hear that? I think the draw's up. - Let's go. - Got it. - Go! - What is it, what's up? - [Player] Wanna start with a good one, man. - Grab my bag. - Wanna be first, man. - Grab my bag. - Oh man, I hope I don't get Jackson. - Where's everybody going? The draw? [rock music] [Joel whistling] [bag tapping] - Loosen up, Joel. Looks like you're constipated. [ball tapping] [Joel whistling] [ball tapping] Stop the whistling. All right, we're gonna play in points. I serve. Let's go. [ball tapping] [Joel groans] - Okay. [ball taps] [Nick grunts] [Joel grunts] [ball taps] [Joel sighs] - Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? - What? - That, that thing with these shorts. - What do you mean? - Keep pulling them up. - I don't do that. - You don't do that? You just did it. You do it every time you miss a point. It's very weird. - No, I never did that. Besides, why are you looking at my shorts? I think you're the one that's weird. - Wait a second, let's get one thing straight, okay? I am the coach here and I just saw, forget it, just forget it. Let's go back and play, all right? [ball taps] [Nick grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball taps] [Joel sighs] Ah, you see? You see You just did it again. - I did? I didn't think I did. In fact, I, I, I'm pretty sure I didn't that time. - Well, if you didn't Einstein, why are they way up there? Get the hell off the court. - [Joel] Already? I, I hardly feel like we've practiced. - You don't need practice, you need to shrink. - Ah. - Come on. - [Announcer] The players are practicing have not been assigned court must get off now. Report to the registration- - Up to the same old shit, huh, Robbins? That's pretty sad. - Oh, no Cowens. Did I feel rain? - Come on, get out of our way. - All right, all right, on court everybody. Let's go. - Come on. - Oh, well, Nick Irons. I should have figured it was you. - Do I know you? - My name's Bill Cowens. I coach the Future's team. - [Nick] Ah, right. Listen, no offense, I was just helping my kid out. - I know what you were doing and I just wanna let you know, I don't appreciate it. In fact, I know a lot about you. I used to be with Prostar around the time that you were banned. I was even on the board for your case. - How interesting. Put that on your resume? - [laughs] That's, that's funny. Funny, you're a funny guy. - Yeah, cut the shit, what do you want? - Little respect, pain and simple. Even a joker like you should know what that is. - Hey, coach, we're playing sets or doing two on ones? - Ah, let's do some two on ones. We'll get to sets in a minute. Oh, oh, by the way, you know you're wasting your time with that Robbins kid? He, he's got no balls. He's, he's a headcase. He, well, you'll find out. All right, yeah, Brock, Jai on that side. Jimmy, Jai's out here. [fast tempo upbeat music] [group chattering] - Can I have your attention please? Good evening. I'd like to welcome everyone to the Orlando Sunbank Tennis Classic. I hope everyone's enjoying themselves and that the players are getting enough to eat. And judging from the Future's team seated right here, I don't think I have to worry, right, Bill? Oh, incidentally, uh, Bill, would you stand up please? How about a nice round of applause for Bill Cowens who's not only the fine coach the Future team but also man responsible for putting this whole damn tour on the map. - Okay, I'll talk to you later.

You screwed up your career and you destroyed us. - You walked out. - Who wouldn't have between the drinking, the gambling, and the screwing around? - [Nick] Okay, okay, so I messed up. I was a kid. - So was I. - Exactly. That's why we owe it to ourselves as adults to sit down and talk things out. Just the two of us. Nice dark restaurant, maybe. Nice bottle of chianti.

I don't see you for 10 years and all of a sudden here you are out of nowhere trying to slip right back into my life as if nothing happened just because you're lonely.

[ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [Joel grunting] [ball tapping] [Joel sighs] Nutcase. [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [bones crack] [ball tapping] - How's your bloke fairing, Nicky? [ball tapping] [Joel groans] - He doesn't castrate himself, he'll probably win. [Nails laughing] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunting] [ball tapping] [fence clanging] - Good game. [dramatic guitar music] Case you didn't notice I won. So what'd you think? - I think you have two more matches to play. And that's just to make the main draw. If you do get in, you better do some damage or else you'll be qualifying again next week. But let's just say you get lucky and you win a couple matches. Well, you better stop smiling 'cause you gotta do it again the next week and then the week after. But let's pretend for argument's sake, Joel, that you have a little talent and you win a couple tournaments. Finish top 16 in the satellite. Great, huh? Bullshit. It means nothing. Big deal. You wanna make some money, make the big time? That's top 100 in the world. That's Wimbledon. That's the US Open. That's when the babes start to whisper your name. What are you now? [scoffs] You're a piece of shit with a serve, who just wanna qualify match in a satellite. Now get ready for your next game. [rackets thud] - You know, not all the greats were ball players. I mean a real ball player has to have class, style. Like Borg for instance. He was a ball player. Djokovic not a ball player. - Hey, Brock, how about Agassi? - Yeah, Agassi, yeah, he's a ball player.

[car door creaks] [car engine rumbling] - You shouldn't be rushing me. I was beating that guy until you rushed me. - Yeah, sure you were, Joel. Sure you were. Meanwhile we have about 10 minutes before post time and there's a horse in the second race that can't lose. - I don't know why you're out here. You're not helping me. - Well I'm out here 'cause your father's paying me. - Well, he shouldn't be. It seems to me you're just stealing his money. - Stealing his money, stealing his money? I don't think so. You see this? Winner ATP championship, solid gold. Melt it down, it's worth 10 grand. - So? - So I don't need to steal people's money. I've got money. - [Joel] Yeah, well, all you're gonna do is blow it on the horses. - That's very observant, Joel, but not quite right. See, this is my screw you money. I don't blow this. I got a little piece of property down in Panama. Sit in the sun all day, drink tequila at night. And this gets me there. - Yeah, why don't you go now? I'm better off without you. - Ah, come on, Joel, you'd be nothing without me. - [scoffs] See, that's where you're wrong. You're just a phony. You're no coach. - Joel, shut up. - All this big talk about top 100. Sure you made it to the big time, but you blew it. You pissed it all away. You're nothing. You're no better than me. [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [dog barking] [car door clicks] - Okay, get out! - What are you doing? - I said get out punk and bring your damn racket! [slow tempo rock music] [car door bangs] Okay, one set, you serve. - Come on, this is crazy, I mean, you're not even dressed for this. - Serve! Damn kid thinks he's a player. Stupid idiot. Wait, Joel, just one question. When you serve, do you breathe in or out? - [Joel] Breathe in or out? What's he mean by that? [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] - Fault. [ball tapping] - [Joel] Relax. Don't think, don't think. [sneakers squeak] [ball tapping] - Double fault. Love 15. [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [Nick grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] Love 30. [racket tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Nick grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel panting] [Joel grunts] [ball taps] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [sneakers squeaking] [Joel groans] - This isn't fair. You're trying to kill me. - Life isn't fair. Serve. Love 40. [ball tapping] [slow tempo playful music] - What are you doing? - I'm getting ready for your pansy ass serve. Go ahead. [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] Fault. [ball tapping] [Joel sighs] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] Double fault, game. - Shoot. - Gimme the ball. My serve. [ball tapping] Now you're gonna see what a real serve is supposed to look like. [ball tapping] 15 love. - You can't do that. - [Nick] I just did it. Come on. - Oh, whatever. [ball tapping] - Oh, shit, there's Brock. [ball taps] 30 love. - Wait, you're gonna take that point? - You're damn right. It's not my fault, you're a paranoid psycho. Let's play. - Fine, let's go. I'll show you how to play.

So don't you ever, ever question my professionalism in the sport of tennis. [gate clanging] [Nick groans] [gate bangs] [car door clicks] - Look I just can't take it anymore. Can't you do something? I think I'd be better off alone. - I hear you, Joel, and I'm very sorry. But you know I already paid this guy Irons in advance, so for the moment, my hands are tired. You know what I mean? Now trust me son, I will find you another coach as soon as possible, all right? Meanwhile, you just gotta hang in there. Be a good boy. I'll be in touch. [phone clicks] [insects chirping] [group chattering] - Hey, Irons, did you hear, Joel's playing one of my boys tomorrow? - You really take this stuff seriously, don't you, Cowens? - [sighs] It's my job, Irons, I'm a coach. You know, maybe one boy out of this whole bunch will actually make a living at this game. I'm just trying to make sure it's one of mine. - I'm choked up. - Bitter, aren't we? Angry that our little 15 minutes in the sun got cut short? [chuckles] Go back to your beer. - What's the matter with you? - I can't believe it. Out of 64 guys I drew Brock. [phone ringing] Nick, I play Brock tomorrow. - We'll pack tonight. [group chattering] - [Dale] Time gentlemen. Mr. Robbins has won the toss, has elected to receive. Players ready? Play. - [Joel] All right, this is my chance to be Brock. He's not so tough. Keep calm, breathe deep. Think quick, think quick. [ball thuds] - [Dale] 15 love. - [Joel] Holy shit, what was that? He got lucky. Okay, I'm ready. He's probably going backhand this time. Gotta look backhand. Think quick, think quick. [ball tapping] He went forehand. - [Dale] 30 love. - I need a drink. - [Joel] Where's he going now? [racket whooshes] [ball thuds] [Joel groans] - [Dale] 40 love. [group laughing] - [Woman] Oh, no. - And you bust, huh? That's my money. - Game one, Haynie six games to one. - You're disgusting. Joel's getting his ass kicked out there and all you care about is your gambling. - So I was having a quick beer, is that a crime? Besides, he doesn't need me out there every second. He does fine without me. - You depress me, Nick. You used to be a guy who stood for something, who cared. But look at you, it's such a waste. [brooding music] - Game Haynie. Haynie leads, 3-1, second set. - Joel, come on now. Hang in there. [ball tapping] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [ball taps] [group laughing] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel groans] - Yes! [Joel groaning] - You all right, Joel? Hey, let me help you up. - Leave me alone. - He needs an injury timeout. Is there a trainer? - I don't need a trainer. I don't need you. - Is the clock on? Is it a default or not? - [gasps] Ah! - This thing's gonna swell up. Maybe you ought a default. - Default? I don't default. I can come back. - Oh, don't be stupid. You can't come back. - How'd you know what I can do? - [Dale] Joel, time's almost up. Are you playing or not? - I'm playing. Now get off the court. [groans] I said get off the court. [group playing] - [Dale] Play will resume. Score is love 30. Haynie leads 3-1, second set. [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] Fault. [ball tapping] Double fault. Love 40 [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [ball tapping] [Joel groans] Game Mr. Haynie. He leads four games to one. [ball tapping] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [Joel groans] Game Mr. Haynie, he leads five games to one. [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [group clapping] [Joel grunts] Game, set, and match, Mr. Haynie, 6-1, 6-1. Thank you, gentlemen. [thunder rumbling] [rain pattering] [ball thudding] [Joel groans] [birds chirping] [ball thudding] [Joel grunts] - What the? [ball thudding] [racket whooshes] Ah! The hell you think you're doing? - You were slow out there today, Joel. Your hands didn't move fast enough. - Ow. - Gotta work on that quickness, your feet are like stone. - Goddammit, stop it, that hurts! - Ooh, you're angry. [ball thuds] [Joel groans] I like to see that. [ball thudding] [Joel groans] It's a fine emotion for tennis. [ball thuds] - You're crazy! - Crazy Joel? Maybe. Crazy enough to think you have a little talent. I hate to see you waste it. - Oh, now you think I have talent. - A little. But you got more than that. That's why I'm gonna help you. - Bullshit! I don't want your help. [ball thuds] - Wanna beat these idiots? You're gonna need me. I'm the only guy that can show you how. - Why? Why now? - [Nick] Goddammit, Joel, do you want my help or not? [brooding music] Now, there's a lot of different ways to become a tennis champion, Joel. Connors got pumped up. Borg was the iceman. Mack got mad. They were all different, but they all had one thing in common. They knew how to intimidate. - [Joel] Did you do that? - I like to think I did. I played a street game. I hustled. I took the rules and I made 'em work to my advantage. See, tennis is a mind game. It's a mind game more than anything else. You have to learn how to break your opponent down mentally before you can start to win. Now we have 10 weeks, Joel. 10 weeks before Champions at St. Petersburg. - Champions, wow. I'd like to make that. - I'm not talking about making it there. Talking about winning the son of a bitch. [triumphant music] [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] [ball thudding] Good. Good. Good, keep it going now. [ball thudding] That's good. Watch yourself. Like it. [Nick grunts] [ball tapping] Let's go, Joel. [dramatic music] [Nick grunts] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [Nick grunts] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] Hit it! Yeah, yeah! [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] Ah, not quite. [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] Little bit better. Wait, freeze. [thunder rumbling] Don't worry, it'll all go away as soon as you start to win. Now come on, hit this! [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [Joel grunting] Push it, Joel, keep moving. All right, Joel. It's called Indian Poker. Whoever has the highest card wins. [thunder rumbling] Your bet. - I bet 10 bucks. - [scoffs] You're 10, up 40. [thunder rumbling] - I'm out. How'd you know? - I bluffed. I saw it in your eyes, you were scared. First rule in tennis, gotta be able to bluff your opponent. Gotta be able to look a player in the eyes and say you're full of shit. [upbeat music] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] - [Umpire] Game Mr. Dobson. He leads 6-3, 4-1. - Okay, look 'em in the eyes. Look him in the eyes. Hey, Dobson. You're full of shit. - Audible obscenity, Mr. Robbins, warning. - Are you serious? For saying you're full of shit? - Default Mr. Robbins. Game set and match to Mr. Dobson. - You're not supposed to say it, you're supposed to think it. [ball tapping] All right, you're gonna have to look at me for signals. Till you can think of yourself out there. - A coach can't give signals. It's illegal. - It's a technicality. Don't shit yourself. They all do it. Joel's signals are easy. I scratch my head, you go to the net. My stomach, you stay back. My right shoulder, you play his forehand. My left shoulder, you play his backhand. Easy. [player grunts] [ball tapping] Now, the great players are separated by the good players by feel, in the hands. It's crucial for volleys. Catch. - Ah. - Feel, Joel. We're working on feel. [egg smashes] [Joel grunts] - Hey, what are you- - Let me guess, breakfast of champions. [water splashing] [upbeat music] [water spraying] - I think it's time you learn the psych move. Say it's four all in the third set. Your opponent's serving, right? Break point. He's nervous. You wanna play with his head, keep him guessing. You do this, you go way outside the doubles alley like this, and you weave up and down. - What's that gonna do? - Forces him to think. Death for a player. He'll double fault, guaranteed. [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Oxburn grunts] [Joel grunting] [fence clanging] - [Joel] Oh no, this is awful. I'm down match point. Bet this guy takes steroids. Shoot, what should I do? Oh no, look who's back, Brock. God, they would be watching. [ball tapping] Hey, I know the psych move, it's guaranteed. Oh, this is gonna be great. [group chuckling] I love this. He's gonna choke. He's got a double fault. - This guy's a moron. [ball tapping] [metal clanging] Yes. - [Umpire] Game set and match Oxburn, 6-2- - Kid's a moron. - 4-6, 6-1. - What a surprise. - Joel, relax. Now number one, like the way you stayed in there, the first two sets, it's very good. Number two, I like the way you challenged the umpire. You didn't get pushed around. Number three, you're a moron. - What? - The psych move, Joel. Bad timing. You gotta do it when there's pressure on him. No one feels pressure when they're serving you 5-1 for Christ's sake. Go take a shower. Got things to do. [fan whirring] [birds chirping] - I think you've made a mistake. The bar is around the corner. - I'm here to pick up Joel's prize money. - Wait here. [door clicks] [cards thudding] - Ah, shit. Dammit, Jai! God! Can't play this goddamn game! - What was that, Jai? - Nothing, coach. Sorry, I didn't mean it. - Uh-huh. Pack your bags. - What? - You heard me. You're gone. Now get out of here. [door bangs] - [Nick] Survival of the fittest. - [Jennifer] At least they respect him. - Do they? Or is it what he can do for them? - Third round singles, 27.50. Here you go. You can buy a lot of beer for this. - You can buy a hell of a lot more than that. In fact, I bet I can show you the time of your life for half that. Interested? Come on, Jennifer, everybody needs a night out. Tell you what, gimme a shot, huh? If I can sink the rest of these cards into this box, then will you go out with me? [card thuds] - Impossible. - No, no, it's not impossible, it's improbable, it's a big difference. You on? - Fine.

I mean, I don't know whether you noticed it or not, Jenny, but kid's a mess. - Listen, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Johansen. A lot of people thought you got a bum deal. - [chuckles] Nah, I deserved it. Got pissed off, you know, I just, just lost it. Learned something though.

Didn't you? - You don't understand, kid's doing well. Even made the goddam last tournament. - I don't care what he made. You were supposed to babysit him for the summer, get this tennis crap out of his head! - Right, right, and send him home so he can lay off Penn State in six while you collect the juice. You're the father of the year. - I know what's best for my own son. - Oh, you do? - Yeah. - [Nick] Didn't you ever ask Joel what he wants? - [Gil] You mind your own damn business, Irons! Think I want him ending up like you, a burnt out drunk living in his car? Joel's gonna work for me. - Okay, fine, fine. But just tell me one thing, why do you want him so bad? - You really wanna know, asshole? - Yeah, I wanna know. - All right, I'll tell you. 'Cause we're talking about a $20 million a year cash business where people like to steal. You know what a bookmaker's biggest nightmare is? His own people ripping him off and cooking the books. That's why I need Joel. The kid is the best I've ever seen with numbers, and he's blood, and blood don't steal. There's just one more tournament. Why won't you let him have a shot? - 'Cause he's a long shot and long shots don't ride in limos. - [Nick] He's good, you know? He's got potential like I never seen. - [Gil] That's bullshit and you know it. - Bullshit, bullshit? I'll tell you what, I'll make you bet, okay? Bookies like the gamble, don't they? - [Gil] So what are you driving then? - This, this for 10 grand. Everything I got. I'm saying Joel wins the whole thing. - [chuckles] You are crazy. Besides I don't need your money. - Oh, that's right. I forgot. It's not the money is it? It's the action. The edge. It's that rush you get right before you're gonna win? Well, how you feeling now, Gil? Wanna bet on that rush? - What's the catch? - Nothing. Nothing, except if Joel wins, you let him decide what he wants to do with his life. You got it? - All right, you're on. No wonder you're always busted. Goddamn lunatic. [door clicks] [door bangs] [car engine rattling] [gentle brooding music] - [Umpire] Good afternoon. This is the first round match between Mr. Arlen Sanders of Augusta, Georgia and Mr. Joel Robbins of Miami, Florida. Players ready. Play. [ball tapping] [suspenseful music] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball taps] [ball tapping] [fence clangs] [group clapping] [ball tapping] [Joel grunting] [group clapping] Game, set, match, Mr. Robbins. 7-5, 6-3. [group chattering] [dramatic music] [ball tapping] [ball taps] [group clapping] Game Robbins. He leads three games to two. [suspenseful music] [group laughing] [ball tapping] Double fault, game, set, match Robbins. [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [player grunts] [ball tapping] - Yes! [grunts] Yes! [grunts] Yes! [group clapping] - [Umpire] Game first set Robbins. Six games to three. - This guy's for real. [slow tempo suspenseful music] [birds chirping] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [triumphant music] - [Umpire] Game Robbins. He leads three games to one. [suspenseful music] [ball tapping] [ball tapping] [ball tapping] [Joel grunting] [ball tapping] Game, set, and match Robbins. He wins 6-3, 6-1. - Congratulations on a match well played Joel. But what about tomorrow's finalist, Brock Haynie? You've never beat him. You're 0 and 4. - So Brock won. - Oh he won very easily, 0 and 3. And what about Nick's coaching method? They're very unusual. I've heard about the Frisbees, the eggs- - Nick, we need to talk. - Not now, Farley, I need to ice his shoulder. - This won't wait. It's been brought to my attention that you and Joel are in violation of rule 365 of the player rule book. - Speak English, Farley. - Under no circumstances will a coach be allowed to convey directives to a player on the court by the use of gestures or signals. - Give me a break, Farley, nobody enforces that rule. Half the coaches out here do it. - Nick, I saw you. Now I'm gonna have to do the fair thing, which is go through the procedures. For now Joel can play in the finals tomorrow as planned. However, you must not be anywhere near the playing court or you will be in violation of the ethics code resulting in Joel's default. - You're serious, aren't you? - I'm very serious. Rules are rules. - This is bullshit. You set this up. - You know, Irons, I'd be happy to have an ATP official interpret the rule for you if you'd like. - Yeah, I bet you would. - Sorry, Mr. Robbins. - Dale, I'd like to have a couple of words with you. Bill, you also. - Sure. - It was you, wasn't it? - What? - Yeah, it had to be. You're the only one I told. Makes perfect sense. - Don't be ridiculous. I wouldn't do anything to hurt you or Joel. - The hell you wouldn't. - Nick. - Nick, this is crazy. We cannot let them get away with this. - They can do whatever they want. - But I can't play without you. The only reason I was winning was because of you. - Joel, you're whining. Now look, there's some things in life you can't change, but you gotta go on. And you're gonna play that match tomorrow by yourself. - Fine, then you have to call off the bet. - Bet? What bet? - Oh, come on, Nick, I heard you guys that night. Still can't believe my dad did that. Don't worry about it, he was just playing the odds. - But you stood up for me. No one's ever done that for me before. - Come on, don't get any wrong ideas, okay? I was making that bet for me. There's a lot of side action I can win down the line with you. - Ah, but what if I lose? What about your gold piece, your property in Panama? - Forget it. - What do you mean forget it? - I mean forget it. - How can you forget it? It's all you have. - All right, all right, all right, you really wanna know? Covered with guano. - Guano? - Guano, bird shit. The whole place is covered with bird shit. Okay, it's worthless. So now you know. - Nick, I'm sorry. Look, no matter what happens tomorrow, I wanna, well, I wanna- - Wait, wait. Would you just quit talking for once? You're very annoying. And back off, you're breathing on me. [thunder rumbling] [brooding music] [group chattering] Nervous, huh? I don't blame you. Big final match, everyone watching. It's pretty scary. Joel, go to the service line. I said go to the service line. Go. Okay, lie face down on the clay. - What? - [Nick] Do as I say? - Okay. - All right, now flop around like you're a fish. - Come on, Nick, this is crazy. - Just do it. [Joel groans] - Check this out. [group laughing] - Now you just made a complete fool out of yourself on Stadium Court. Can only get better from here. [gentle upbeat music] [hands tapping] [suspenseful music] [group chattering] All right, concentration, that's the key. I want you to forget about everything out there, okay? The people, the crowds, everything. Look, Joel, I just wanna say, I know I haven't always been the greatest coach and I'm sorry. - Nick, it's okay. [hand tapping] - Oh and Joel, just remember, no matter what happens, you're full of shit. - Ah. - Welcome back to St. Petersburg, Florida. This is Fred Stolle along with Cliff Drysdale. And we're just moments away from the player's arrival on Stadium Court. It's a scorcher out here today for the finals. We're about to see heavily favored Brock Haynie take on the unknown Joel Robbins. Robbins is a surprise finalist here. Doesn't appear to have much of a chance in this match. At least on paper. [group clapping] - The lines judges are taking their positions. They are ready for the Southern Satellite Champions Finals at the beautiful Stouffer Vinoy Resort in St. Petersburg, Florida. - [Fred] And we'll be right back after this message. - Hey, it's a great day for the big match, huh? - Oh, couldn't be better. - Yeah, you know, if this gets tight, it's gonna be up to you. [chuckles] - What do you mean? - Well, you know, winning's a fine line. Tennis game of inches. Make it happen. - I don't understand. - Oh, I think you do understand, Dale. I think you better. I think you understand just fine. There aren't that many employment opportunities around for a 45-year-old guy who likes to chase little boys around the locker room. So don't screw this up. [Bill chuckles] - Hey Bill, good luck. - Hey, thanks. [group clapping] [mic feedback squeaking] - [Fred] Here come the two finalists out on the court. Brock Haynie from Trenton, New Jersey. And Joel Robbins from Miami, Florida. Haynie of course has been outstanding on the satellite tour. He's quite a player. There's a lot at stake for both boys. - Hey, Joel! - Kid must be nervous. - Mr. Haynie has won the toss and has elected to receive. Players ready. Play. [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] Fault. [Joel grunts] [ball taps] Double fault. Love 15. [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball taps] Love 30. [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel groans] [group clapping] Love 40. [man laughs] [ball tapping] Fault. Double fault. Game Haynie. [group laughing] Haynie leads, one game to love. First set. - Hey Robbins, it's not too late for that modeling job. [brooding music] [ball tapping] [Brock grunts] [Joel grunts] - [Dale] 15 love. [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] 30 love. [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] 40 love. [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel groans] Game Haynie. He leads three games to love, first set. [group laughing] - I knew this would happen. What an embarrassment. [ball tapping] - [Dale] Game Haynie. Game Haynie. [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] Game Haynie. Game and first set to Haynie. Six games to one. - Well, this is turning into a real romp. Haynie's just killing him out there. Seems to be a bit of a mismatch. Reminds me of the time I kicked your butt down in Joburg in '65. - [Cliff] And we will be right back with the second set in just a minute. [group cheering] - [Dale] Game Haynie. He leads two games to love. - [Fred] Hey Cliff, we have a look at this stuff, will you? Haynie's having a bit of fun out there. [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [group clapping] [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] [ball tapping] [group oohing] Kid loves to showboat. - Yeah! [ball tapping] - [Nick] Now you just made a complete fool out of yourself on Stadium Court. It can only get better from here. [slow tempo suspenseful music] [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] - [Fred] Hey, hell of a shot there by Robbins. Seems to have woken up a little. [ball taps] Oh, there you go another big shot. - [Dale] 40-30. [ball tapping] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [ball tapping] [dramatic music] Game Robbins. [group clapping] [ball taps] [Brock grunts] [ball taps] [Brock grunts] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [group cheering] Game Robbins. Games are 3-2 Haynie, second set. - Dale, you gotta do something about these cameras. Guys can hurt themselves. - Camera people going to have to move back please. - Don't let up. [birds chirping] - [Fred] Back to play now. [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [group cheering] - Correction. Correction, serve one is out. - You sure? That that lineman just saw it good? - Yes, Mr. Robbins, the ball was out. Continue play. Advantage Mr. Haynie. - [Fred] Dale Foley, a very competent umpire seems quite firm in his opinion. - [Cliff] Yeah, look good from up here. Of course, even my ex-wife looks good from up here. [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Brock grunts] [group cheering] - Score is deuce. [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [Brock grunts] [ball taps] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [Brock grunts] [ball taps] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [group cheering] Overruled. Ball was out. Advantage Mr. Haynie. - What, are you blind? That ball was way in. - Code violation. Mr. Robbins. Point penalty. Game Mr. Haynie. He leads 4-2. [group booing] - He's getting ripped off. [group cheering] - [Fred] Wonderful shot by Robbins. Break point for him. Wins this and he's right back in the match. [ball tapping] - Time. [ball taps] - [Dale] Serve is ace. Score is deuce. [group booing] - Wait a minute. I had my hand up over head, didn't you see? - The serve was good, Mr. Robbins. Play tennis. - They're cheating him. That asshole's cheating him, even I know that. - He's hooking him. That bastard's hooking him. - Time violation. Point penalty advantage Mr. Haynie. Play Mr. Robbins, or you'll be defaulted. 10 seconds, Mr. Robbins. [hands clapping] - Seems to be some kind of commotion going on down here in the stands. - Farley, you chicken shit chimpanzee candy ass, how much you getting paid to cheat for this bastard? - Irons, that's enough! Irons, you're not supposed to be here. You're in violation of Rule 365. - Oh, I'm in violation? I'm in violation? Hey, yeah, you hear this Fred? This bum says I'm in violation. The same jerk that's been cheating my kid all afternoon. I mean is this a crock of shit or what? - And now a word from our sponsor. - I think you've just seen this match. - I demand a default. - Default. Game, set, match Haynie. - Sure, why not? - [Cliff] Well, it looks like Irons has done it again. - Joel Robbins has been defaulted because his coach, Nick Irons walked onto the grounds. I have never seen anything weirder than this. - What the hell do you think you were doing? - Me? What was I doing? - This lunatic has ruined the finals. Now he should be banned for life. - Then you should be too because I haven't seen him do anything that you haven't done. The match continues. Farley, get your scrawny butt out of that chair. [group cheering] - Wait a minute. He's already been defaulted. - Not by me. And as tournament director, I have a decision to make, gentlemen. Now I've seen both of you use signals, so I should end the game right here and now and default both players, but they're really not to blame. So the match continues under Davis Cup rules. That means you can coach from the sidelines. I'm gonna keep this thing fair one way or another. - Ms. Hudson, your future's getting shorter. - Some future working for you, Cowens. Let's start play. Tommy, could you please take the chair? - Yeah! - [Tommy] Ladies and gentlemen, this game will continue. There'll be a five minute delay while the grounds crew cleans up the court. - Jennifer. Jennifer. Thanks. - For what? I was just doing my job. And what were you doing out there? - I was standing up for Joel. - [Jennifer] Well you damn near cost him the match. - He'd lost anyway. At least he's got his dignity. - [Jennifer] What do you know about dignity? - I bet my life on it. [gentle brooding music] - [Jennifer] And what's that supposed to mean? - Johansen. Yeah, he was messed up in the head. Thought he could go around making things up about you. - [Jennifer] What things? - Does it matter? - Yes. - He thanked me for staying out all night partying with Nails after the finals at Newport. Said if I hadn't, he never found out what a great piece of ass you were. And they banned me. - Well, he wasn't making it up, Nick. [Nick scoffs] - What the hell do I know? - I don't know what to say. - Don't. It's only a game. - [Tommy] Time, gentlemen. - Brock, we're okay here. Now it's just a couple more games. Don't try for anything too big, huh? - I got it. - Yeah. [group clapping] - [Tommy] Spectators, take your seats. This 4-2, advantage Haynie. Mr. Haynie serving. Play.

What an amazing comeback. Third and final set coming up. - Strings are loose, give me this thing. - Don't let up. - [Tommy] Time, gentlemen. - Go get him. All right, you can do it. Keep believing. Let's go.

He leads six games to five. - Stay focused, stay concentrated. Don't panic, you can do this. All right, go get him. [ball taps] [Brock grunting] [ball tapping] [hand clapping] [Brock grunting] [ball tapping] [group clapping] [ball tapping] [Brock grunts] [group clapping] [ball tapping] [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] - [Tommy] Game Haynie. Game 6-all. We will now play the 12 point tiebreaker. - Okay, what now, Nick? What should I do? Well, Nick? - What the hell do I know? Play tennis. - [Cliff] Fred, this is getting exciting. It all comes down to the tiebreaker. The tiebreaker, of course, the first player to get to seven points with a margin of two. [bird chirping] [suspenseful music] [ball tapping] - Yeah! - [Tommy] 1-0 Robbins. [ball tapping] [Brock grunts] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [Brock grunts] [ball taps] [group clapping] One fault. - Way to go, Brock. [ball tapping] [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] [Brock grunts] [ball taps] - Yeah! [ball taps] [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [group clapping] - [Tommy] 4-all. [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball tapping] [Brock grunting] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [group clapping] 6-5 Haynie. [brooding music] - All right! - Haynie is serving at match point. He's one serve away from winning the championship. - Hang in there, Joel. - That's okay, Brock. - That's the way, Joel. - You can do it, Joel. - [Fan] Come on, Joel, come on. - [Fan 2] Dig deep, Joel! - [Joel] Come on Brock, show me what you got. [Brock grunts] [ball tapping] [Joel grunts] [ball taps] [Brock grunts] [triumphant music] - 6-all - Yeah! - All right, shake it off. Come on, hang in there. - Come on, Joel. - Quiet please. [ball tapping] - Come on, Brock, dig deep. [Brock grunts] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [ball taps] [ball taps] [Brock grunts] [ball taps] [Joel grunts] [ball taps] [Brock grunts] [group clapping] - I cannot believe he missed that shot. A critical mistake. - Mistake my ass, he just choked, man. - [Fred] Well, it is match point for Robbins. The championship is at hand. - [Fan 3] Come on, Joel. [ball taps] - Joel, you're winning. - Come on, Joel. - [Woman] Come on baby. - Come on, Joel! - Hey, Brock! - Go, Haynie. - Joel. - [Fan 3] Come on, Joel, you can do it. - [Fan 4] You're game, Joel. - Joel! - Go, Brock!

He wins 1-6, 7-5, 7-6. - Yeah, he did it! He did it! He won! - I don't believe it. In what has to be one of the biggest upsets of the year, unknown and unheard of Joel Robbins has just become the new Satellite Champion. - Good match, Joel. I guess you are a ball player. - Son of a bitch! - Joel, great match. Great match. You know, you, you showed me something out there today. I know the odds were stacked against you, but you came through like a champion. I, I think I was wrong about you. I think you do have a big future in this game. Why don't we sit down tomorrow, talk about it? - Mr. Cowens, sir. - Yes, Joel. - You're full of shit. [Bill chuckles] - Not bad for a head case with no balls. - Hey, let me through. Joel, Joel! Oh! Joel, you were a fantastic, son. You made me very proud. I'm sorry, I had no idea you could play that well. You got a lot of plans to make. So what's it gonna be? You wanna keep this bum as your coach or what? - You serious? - I'm very serious. - Yeah. - You were right, Irons. Sometimes a long shot does come in. Thanks. Come on son, we got a lot of catching up to do. [group clapping] I'll be in touch. Good work. - Hey. - Hey. - You leaving? - Yeah, I'm starting over. - Hear it's a lot better if you have company. - Oh, you and I, Nick, impossible. - No, not impossible, improbable. - Big difference. - Tell you what, let's leave it up to fate. - Oh no. - Pick any card in this deck except the king of hearts. That's you and me forever. - Wait a minute. That's not the way it goes. - You're right. I'm tired of gambling, especially on things I love. [gentle music] [group cheering] Joel went on to play the Grand Prix circuit. [dramatic music] I coached him of course. He did all right too. Playing well at the French, Wimbledon, and the US Open, but especially at the US Open. The place where the babes whisper your name.
