( car alarm chirps ) ( quietly ) Oiyeh. Oiyeh. MULLY: I can start at the beginning. I remember that time very well. I lived in a small hut, together with my little brothers and my mother and father. My father had no job, and he used to come home every day totally drunk. I was just a little boy. I did not know what was happening, and what was going to happen. He was so cruel to my mother, as she screamed for help, and nobody was coming. That was my life when I was a young boy. I... I woke up... and there was nobody. Everybody had gone. I looked everywhere, but I saw nothing. And I realized that I was completely alone, abandoned. A child without parent. You... you can't imagine it. Me, I was that child. I can remember, I went to my uncle, was a drunkard. And I was so hungry. And my uncle said no. And he said off you go. You go. Then I started walking around the village, begging for food. Pleading with people to help me. For about ten years, I kept on begging. I became a beggar. Even sometimes taking things that were not mine to survive. And I became hard, I became full of hatred. I became a street boy. And then I started asking myself, why I was really born, why I was really living. I hated my life. And I thought I don't really deserve to live in this kind of life, and I wanted to take away my life, because there was no meaning. But a young man came. He saw me in a desperate situation. He invite me to prayer and fellowship, and there was a preacher who was speaking about forgiveness of our sin. I thought, why should I trust this man? The preacher prayed, he said work hard, and by faith, there is nothing impossible before God. This struck in my mind, and a new hope was planted in my heart. The next morning, I walked going to the center of Nairobi to get a new life. I had no money, not even a single cent in my pocket. It took me about three-and-a-half days. I never finished school, so I didn't know what kind of a job I would be able to work. I landed to Nairobi where there are people with money, those who have power, those who have jobs, but nobody was ready to help me. And then I was just looking at everybody, and they'd look at me, and they said, "What are you doing here? You need to go and look for a job, you cannot beg, we cannot, I cannot give you money." I looked in one area where there are rich people, where they have big houses, and there, I was knocking everywhere. And I happened to find a gate somewhere in Nairobi. And again, here I am, going to a place where I was not invited, but I'm knocking that door. I knocked. The lady asked me, "Why are you disturbing us here? You are knocking the gate, what do you want me to do for you?" When she said come in, I was so happy to hear that. It was really my day. The lady gave me some work to do every day, cleaning the floor of her house, washing dishes, cutting grass outside, the field of two acres. There were no machine those days. And she also gave me some food, because there was food that remained in the dishes, and that is what I had after I finished work. So life become good and better than ever before. And so, after six months, this Indian woman, she spoke to her husband, who was the CEO of a very big farming company. And I was promoted to manager. Delegate over 800 workers. And I bought a very nice shirt. And I was able to save some money. Then I saw a beautiful young lady, and then I was like, oh, well. Something, you know, touched my heart. And you know, I've never talked about it. I was afraid about women. I had no confidence in myself, being able to be loved, and now there's a smile, I have courage to talk to this young lady, and that went so well. And after some time, voila, he got me. I have eight brothers and sisters. Our first one is called Miriam. Then we have Janey. She's more the tough one, you know. Then from Janey, we have Grace. Grace is the smart one. And from Grace, we have Ndondo. Ndondo is more the mama's baby. From Ndondo, we have Kaleli. Kaleli is... he's a big brother. Then we have Mueni. Mueni is the one who listens to everybody. She has a listening ear. Then we have my younger brother Dickson. More of the politician, I would say. Then we have me, the geek. Actually, we're a full football team, I think. MULLY: I was so happy. I have a family, I have a car. I had a dream. I want to do business and make money and make money, and I came to understand there's a great need of matatu, which is taxis. He had some cassettes, CDs. He used to play music for me. And also, he used to sing for me. He was singing the Jim Reeves. MULLY: Jim Reeves, Skeeter Davis. Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers, Don Williams. There are so many rock and roll, you know. So many good music, and then, everybody liked to go in my car. ♪ Walkin' on quicksand, walk slow ♪ ♪ Billy, billy bayou, watch what you say ♪ ♪ A pretty girl will get you one of these days ♪ And then, everybody, they knew me. Mullyways. Mully. Ways. Mullyways was my trademark. You know, he was so proud of it. ♪ ISAAC: And he would drive endless days without sleeping. Working hard so he can buy another one, and he bought another one, and another one after that. He had a fleet of buses that he was in charge of. He did not need to drive them anymore. He had people driving for him, making money for him. In 1987, he formed Mullyways Agencies Limited. And then, he moved to the next level of business and was selling tires. He had a welding company, he had a car parts shop. From there, he opened his own insurance company. From the insurance company, he moved to real estate. Mullyways real estate, and out of this the real estate, you remain with about 20%, 30% that you put it in your pocket. You really feel good. So with money, I could buy anything. I bought my own Mercedes Benz from Germany. I felt great. We had a big living room, I had my own bedroom. and it was awesome. I was one of the coolest kids in the hood, because we have a TV, right? We have a carpet in the house, so we can play, and it's not cold on the floor. Just simple things like that. NDONDO: Having servants in the house, having, you know, drivers. And so many cars. And Dad would change his car every other... Like, in a year, he would have three or four cars. He would sell them, buy others. Always used to go to Mombasa, to Lake Makuru, to Boringo. Sometimes we'd also go to the dam or the falls or picnics. For me, it was not the actual act of playing games, but the fact that we had time together. We had time just to laugh, you know. Laugh at nothing but the fact that life is good. But it was becoming more and more, and the more I did, then the more I also got profit, and there is no end. The more you get, then the more, you want to have more. That is the nature of people. JANEY: We lived a life of riches, because we were on top of the class. We had parties and dinners all the time, and had so many guests, so many visitors that used to come. It was wonderful just to be feeling so influential. DICKSON: That's the class of people we were. My dad was the Great Gatsby of Kenya. ♪ MULLY: And it was really so good. I got connected to some of these people, who are also rich, and they owned Total oil products, and they were looking for a prominent person to sell and distribute their products. I really realized the value of having money. It's more than anything else that you can think of. It's having the power in my hand. ISAAC: And then my dad had the monopoly in oil and gas. Really, it does not get any better than that. Where else do you want to go from there? MULLY: I traveled to Europe for business, traveling in different parts of the world. Traveled also to New York, when they used to have the twin towers. I remember going up almost to the top, and then just seeing the city. I really felt like, ah, it was my time. Coming right from the bottom to the highest point, to become the supplier of oil, gas in all of Western Kenya, and always when I remember that, I see impossible becoming possible. So things were really coming up so well. I had so many workers by then, business was good, but one day, I got the shock of my life. My dad, um, wrote me a letter, and this letter, when I read it, said, "My son, it's a long time since I last saw you. And therefore, I'd like you to come, my firstborn son, come home. There are things of great importance that you need to come and address here." So my mind was going around and around, not knowing what to do. I can remember very well, when we were very young, our brother, elder brother, Charles, we left him. We were forced to go to look for a piece of land. We left him behind. This was very hard for me. The letter I got pleaded with me to come and intervene. I thought about it, and I shared with my wife. Then I decided to go there. And I found my father was in so much, so much trouble. He owed money to the village, but he could not pay anything. So the people in the village have a big meeting. My father was put down on the ground. Then I was asked by the chief, what do you want us to do? And then I said, "Do what you want." During that time, these people were furious. They were saying beat him, punish him. He has done some bad dishonor. But the way my father was crying down there, that made me upset. Then I looked at the chief, I said, please, I say stop. I said I'm ready. I am ready to pay what they needed so that my father could be saved. This is how we used to survive on the street in some instances. We used to help people park their car. We'll guide them as they're parking. In exchange, they have to give us money. I can't count the number of times I've stabbed other boys and women when we want to steal from them and they are resisting. And this is a man who is rich by all standards. I can say he was a millionaire. And because I lived a life full of hatred and anger from my home in the slum, every time I used to hurt somebody, for me, it was like a revenge. I used to feel good because people used to hurt me, and I hated to do so to these people. And when he comes out, his car is gone. So what can he do? He goes and reports it to the police station. My car is stolen, and that evening, he has to go back, public transportation, probably in one of his buses. Going by bus, all I thought was about the boys. Why didn't I give these young people money? I am not feeling well. I became sick. I saw faces of me inside them. I saw myself. I was really disturbed, but something was building in my heart. I was really tormented by these boys in the street. And I could not work anymore, and then, I told my secretary, I told her that I was going home. I drove from my office, and kept on driving and driving. I did not know where I was going. I found myself far away. And there, I stopped my car, and then, I started crying in the car. I cried, questioning God. Why have You done this to me? With all the wealth that I had, why is it that God want to take me back again to the poverty? Four hours in the car, I struggled with God. And then, after four hours, He took me down. I said, yes, God, use me. And the moment I said, yes, God, I got the greatest joy in my heart. JANEY: I remember him coming home, and then he comes in, and he sits down, and I notice something is different about him. Every evening, we had dinner together as a family, and the night that Dad told us, we were sitting as always. NDONDO: Dad asked us how was your day, and everybody would say, one by one, how your day was, how was school. And then finally, Dad says, I have been thinking and praying about something for so long, and I'm wondering, hmm. So is it another holiday? This is exciting. The words that followed just completely shocked me. MULLY: I will never, ever do business again. I told them I will never, ever work for money. My face turned on to Mom, and Mom looked perplexed. She looked like they had talked about it, but they had not really talked about it. He went on to elaborate that God had actually shown him that he needed to sell everything, and start helping the poor in the society, the children who ere abandoned, the street children, and I was there like I could not fathom no more income coming in. It was too much for me, you know, how you feel as though the world has collapsed beneath your feet? That is how it felt at that time. After that, dinner was finished quite quickly. On plain language, that's called total madness. That's what it is. MULLY: In the street, you are not sure whether you're gonna wake up the next morning. DAVID: To come to the street in the middle of the night, it was really, really dangerous for him and for his life. By then, we had already smoked marijuana, had taken some heroin, and we were cutting, knives, and we were sniffing gasoline, and so any slight mistake then, that could have been the end of his life. Oiyeh. ISAAC: What my mom went through, I don't think any mom should go through that. You marry into a secure family, whereby your kids will be provided for, until your husband goes and decides to sell everything. You know, how, how... how do you let go of what you hold dearly? And how do you decide when, when to share your love? That must have been hard for her to do that. Somewhere in the back of her head, she must have gone, "What am I going to do when the money runs out?" But she did it anyways. MUENI: Mom had to cook for the children, and she had to, she was the nurse and taking care of everything you can think of, everything. ESTHER: I was the one who was taking care for the children. I would wash their clothes and cook for them, give them the medicine when they were sick. This is very hard work, but I didn't get tired, because I loved the family, and I loved my husband. Initially, we had three children, four children, and the number kept on growing. And now our family was suddenly bigger, from nowhere. I went to the street. Then I brought them, every day. There was no one day that we said it is enough. I had never said there was no space for a child who was suffering. NDONDO: As the days progressed, I was praying in my heart that this would not be true, that Dad was just joking, and he would continue working. I thought, he will not shut everything down. ISAAC: People give donations. Why can't you do that? Why can't you just sponsor a kid? That would be awesome. You can work, sponsor a kid, perfect. We still live our life, everyone is comfortable. But he actually stopped all the businesses, he started selling stuff, he started closing shop, and people called him crazy. Even others as close as me could not understand. Do you close a business in order to save street kids? Do you... can you do that? That seems a little bit strange. He didn't tell us he was bringing the children in our house to share with us. I think that was really, really rude of him. They smelled so bad. They had flies on them, tattered clothes, and no shoes. They broke the toilet, how that happened, I do not know. I think they were just stepping on the toilet, and they broke it. I despised them because Mom, suddenly, was taking time to go and bathe them. They were given one of the rooms in our house. MUENI: There was no time for much after that, in terms of the family, the nuclear family. There was no privacy anymore. I couldn't understand why, why, why, and I kept blaming those children again. ( children shouting ) And theirs was just to laugh and just have fun in our house. ISAAC: After then, it was, "Mom, this is happening, Mom, this is happening, Mom." NDONDO: And they were playing with stones, and playing with all sorts of things and breaking our windows. MUENI: They were swinging on curtains, they were climbing on the walls. That was unheard of before they came. The house was meticulously clean every day. NDONDO: It was really rough, and the children became now hundreds suddenly, and we had to share some of the rooms with them. Because the kids were so many, I went to the street, brought more. JANEY: Of course, he brought more children, and more children and more children. And now, he had to extend the house, so that they had enough space for the children. The compound was small. The garden had to be thrown out, our playground had to be removed, our swings had to remove, the lawn had to be removed, and my dad put these wooden structures, which were pretty much ugly to me, and everything had to be cemented, just so he could set up a school for the kids. I remember I had a favorite dress, it was yellow in color. ( singing ) And I needed to give out my favorite dress, along with other things, clothes and shoes and toys. ISAAC: It wasn't really working well, you know. It was like us against the kids. JANEY: They were rough, they would fight between themselves, and want to fight with us. MULLY: It was not good. I don't remember one day that my own children were happy at all. And it got to a point that we could not settle in very well with the kids, and we had to go to boarding school. MULLY: They had no choice. I took five of them, my own biological children, to boarding school, so that we could have enough time to care and to love these children. We had to do that to sacrifice. Grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, I was in boarding school. I remember the whole time, my dad came once for a board meeting. And my parents came to visit me with my siblings. And she had on my yellow dress. ( singing ) I felt that he had kicked us out, he had abandoned us, so he could spend time with his other kids, who did not even belong to him. GRACE: I felt angry. I really felt angry because I was wondering, who are these children anyway? Why can't their parents give them the things they are taking from me? My mother was a prostitute, and at that time, I was seven years, and my mother would come home drunk, and she could bring some men in the house, maybe two men, one for her, and she would bring one for me, and when I refused, she would start beating me. They told me that your mother was a prostitute, so she died because of AIDS, and they told me that's why we think you have the same disease. ( sobbing ) They brought me to Eldoret where the other kids were. They would come to me. They did not care if I was doing prostitution. They decided to take me in. I was amazed to see all the kids. There were so many kids calling Dad their dad. So I was wondering, which kind of a family is this? First time I met Charles, one of the first things that stood out was just his smile. He was welcoming. He would look at you straight in the eye and say, "Oiyeh." It's a sign of peace, and to see that he's come to bring good. And then, he took us to his home. He came and welcomed me, he smiled big smile. It was so broad, it was so warm, and you see that he's a father looking down. He said, "Welcome, this is your family now. These are all your brothers and sisters." DAVID K.: It was a moment that I cannot explain. I had never lived in a nice house, given nice food. I've never met my biological dad, yet here is a man saying that he was going to take care of us. The street children were considered as bad people. You can't bring them to a holy place. I was a young boy in the Sunday school classes. I still remember to this day how sad that looked. And one of the elders asked them to go out, because those are bad people, and we are good people. MULLY: I was given all kinds of names, but I made the covenant, and I knew whom I was saving. I said I would really rather die than to stop. It was unimaginable that they would say you choose the children or choose to be in the church. Mom's friends were telling her she needs to leave Dad, she needs to divorce Dad, because how is this possible? They told her that Dad is crazy, that she should take him to hospital for a check-up. And they would ask her how could she take this. Why can't she leave this crazy man? And my mom, I'm sure, as a woman, probably she thought about it. But Mom stood by him, and she supported him unconditionally. And not because she had to, but because she chose to. I think losing those friends brought us closer as a family, because then we needed to rely on each other. We were each others' friends, we were all we had. ( all singing ) And life moved on, and the children became more, and the finances became minimal. It was going down in the bank, down and down every year, every year. Me and my younger brother had to come and study with the rest of the kids, and it didn't make much sense. My wife came one evening and said, "My dear, our stores are running out of food." And then I said, why are you asking me about where we are going to get food? Don't you remember I said you ask God, pray? It was no point of return. I thought, what are we going to do now? And from nowhere, we heard the bell on the gate ringing, and someone went to check, and there was a lady we did not know, and she came with a truck full of food. I was speechless that this lady said, "Here, this is for you." A donation for the first time. SAMMY: And even for us that were watching him, and listening to him, we were all amazed, but we watched, and with the passing of the day, these children became more and more responsive, more and more obedient, more like family. They respected him, each of them calling him Dad, calling Mrs. Mully Mom, and we saw a very significant change in their lives. And he began to train those kids to be responsible. For example, teaching metal work and woodwork, tailoring both adult and children's clothes, even gardening to bring up some vegetables right on the compound. That's why I think now I can say Mully children, not just home, but family, and in family, you teach everything. It got to a point where there was no more room for more kids in the compound. Everyone was brushing shoulders with each other. And so, kids got on the bus, and boom, the move started. MULLY: Mully Children's Family. We started our journey. We drove all the way via Nairobi, and then to Ndalani. DICKSON: And this is moving from a very big house in Eldoret to a place that is made of earth and soil, and iron sheet roofing, and there's nothing. MUENI: There was no water, there was no electricity. We used to use kerosene lamps back then. But makeshift buildings were put in place. Children came in, and we started living there. KALELI: At that time in 1995, the place was very hot. It was 105 and 110 at times in a year, and it was very difficult to work the land. NDONDO: But he would say that this place would be full of fruits, it would be full of vegetables. And I would ask, what? It's so dry. WILSON: And he would tell us about these things, and sometimes we wouldn't understand it, and sometimes, we'd think he's crazy, because he was dreaming about us having a dormitory built with stones, and at that time, we were staying in a tin shed. MULLY: And I felt really a lot of pressure. You have all these children who want to eat, others crying, and others, they need to be taken to hospital, and in some of the cases, HIV. And they started complaining. They said, "No, Dad, we don't want to stay here. There are no people here." We are in the desert, you know, and they wanted to run away. JANEY: So some children left Ndelani to go sniff glue in the streets. DICKSON: Cocaine, heroin, glue, alcohol, (indistinct). ESTHER: You know, the kids are kids forever in the world. And when we see the children going back to the street, we are not happy, because we know we lose them, and they are going back, and maybe they're going to die there, because in the street, there is no love. There is no people who love them. MULLY: I always go back along the street in the slums, everywhere, looking for them. When I find them, they always say, we cannot believe it. This must be a dream. I tell them, please, this is your home. We built that place by hand, step by step, brick by brick. We built every building, every foundation that was laid there. I learned about construction with the rest of the children. I learned how to put brick on mortar, how to make the ratios of cement and sand, balanced and all that, and right now, I have so many skills that I learned as I grew up that even now, I can use them in my day-to-day life. And we continued to do that, training the boys how to build not only building houses, but a bridge. The bridge back here we have started over the last two weeks now, and in order to beat the time, we do not know exactly when the rain will come. We do not know. But even though, it's quite unfortunate that the whole area is affected by this fear of drought. We are taking this advantage of building such a bridge, so that even when it rains then, it's just like Noah's Ark. When people ask you why are you building this, but the reality is that, one day, the rain will come. ISAAC: During the drought, we did not have any water that we could boil from the river, so he had to drive four hours every day to Nairobi to get water so that the kids here could have water to drink. It was really a hard time for this country as a whole. They took water four days ago. That's when they had water last. Those people were really dying by drinking bad water that they were trying to take along the riverside, when there was no water flowing, and they were dying. I remember a young boy, his name was Oscar Kipurange. Um, he got sick, and it was because of the water. DICKSON: He was very low during that time. He was trying to figure out, God, you didn't give me these kids here for them to die in my hands. I remember Dad and Mom praying about it, and Dad crying, praying, saying he was begging for water, and then, one night, he woke up, he woke Mom up, and they went outside. NDONDO: And they walked from the house where they were staying. DICKSON: And he felt a voice telling him to walk up, straight, turn, and that's the place where water will come. NDONDO: They prayed, and they felt that this is the place where they needed to dig. MUENI: He believed that there was water there, and they prayed, and the work started the next day. NDONDO: It was hard to believe him. Very hard. DICKSON: Most of the workers did not believe it, so they did not want to start digging. They refused actually to be part of it, and us, the kids who came, and we started digging and digging. NDONDO: My brother Dickson and Isaac, they dug for the water. Now this is after trying to dig a couple bowl-holes with machines, going a couple hundred feet down to get water, and we do not have any water, and this guy goes like, you know, we need to grab a couple of mattocks and start digging. That is total craziness. Most of us not believing. We started digging for a couple of days, and we dug, we dug, and we got to this hard rock. It's a volcanic rock, and you know, we called my dad, and told him we've dug your vision, and this is where it's taken us. We have a rock, and there's no water, so what should we do? My dad says, "I was shown water here, and just keep on digging." So during that time, it was the time for my younger brother's class to go and dig, so he got in there, and he was digging, and he takes this mattock and just hits on the rock. And all of a sudden, water got out! ISAAC: I remember my brother yelling, "Hey, Dad, Mom, we got water!" and my dad's like, what? And water, it just came out pouring from the ground, and there was a lot of commotion and everything, because it was unheard of. GRACE: And you know, they started shouting. They're shouting, "Majee, majee!" Majee means water. They're shouting, "Water, water," because it was actually coming. ISAAC: When I finally got to understand why he was doing it, I regained trust in my dad, and from then, I started supporting him. MUENI: And after that, we had water in Ndelani, in an area where it is not known to have any well. There are no wells in this area. It is unheard of, but we do have water, and the children stopped getting as sick as they were getting sick, so that's, that is a miracle. KALELI: A water purification system was set up, and from that, there was a water tower that was constructed, and this was able to supply water not only to the children, but also, we got water also for use in the farm, and that's where it began. Over a period of time, the number of children grew all the way to more than a couple of hundred, to 1,000, and the need to feed the children was very high. And Dad was thinking on how to be self-sustaining, and that's where the farming part really took a different turn. The idea of us being able to be self-reliant was a very paramount aspect of how my father was viewing the entire project. You know, people in Africa, in Kenya, they all, even the government, they depend on donation from the western world, and then I always feel like what can we do as Africans to change that attitude. KALELI: My father noticed that, and started to think through how he could do something differently to be able to complement the donations we were having. Because I used to beg, you know. A beggar has got no choice. That's something I hated, and for that reason, I said I will never beg, and then I kept on thinking how can we build a project that would be self-sustaining. KALELI: As we began, we had (indistinct) with oxen, now to 500 acres using a tractor. Right now, as we're sitting here, we're looking at crops that are growing so well, the production is so many times the conventional outdoor production. We're able to sell excess that we produce from here in the European market, so that we can have some income to sustain Mully Children's Family. Then in 2003, we got to design a hydroponics system, which is a greenhouse covering about 600,000 square feet, so the water will collect as rainwater on top of the greenhouses, and it's conveyed through a piping system into reservoirs. That water will be used to carry out fish farming. This is a new venture. We are trying to put up some fishes. Here on my right is 2000. A small pond here. This is something that we want to do. Train people how to fish, train people how to eat after getting the fishes, so that is what I mean, yeah. So you see, little fishes have grown into big fish like these. Yeah. KALELI: After harvesting water from the top of our greenhouses, which is almost a billion liters, then we use that water to irrigate the trees. We can do something with our own hands We do not have to wait for the government to tell us what to do, because this is our Kenya. This is our future. To plant trees, so that we can attract water to this place, because, as you can see, it's very dry. We hope to come here over and over again, until we turn this yard into a forest. Since 2004, we've planted over 1.5 million trees in this property alone. The water goes up and forms the clouds, and from forming the clouds, we have rainfall. With trees being planted annually, we have been able to create a microclimate, and therefore, we have more regular rainfall. This is real. When I bought this piece of land, there was nothing. There was no trees, nothing, no water. And through planting trees, through water conservation, I've seen that really working. One bigger dream that I have is to transfer the knowledge to the young generation, so that we change Africa, we change our country Kenya. WOMAN REPORTER: This is what's been unleashed in Kenya. Ethnic warfare at its most basic and most brutal. A man being murdered because he belongs to a different tribe. I remember sitting watching TV, and Kenya was burning. And we were sitting there, and I remember my dad called us and he said, "We can't let this happen, we have to do something." The government, they were overwhelmed completely, and the children didn't have food. Dad had said if we don't step in, children are going to die. By then, there were internally displaced persons camps that had been set up by the government, the biggest being in Eldoret. So when Dad said that, it was traumatic for us. Okay, work. Let's go and work. DICKSON: I remember very well that day in the bus. Buses had been burnt on the side of the road, dead bodies everywhere. We were all so scared. What if we get killed ourselves? NDONDO: The authorities there did not want Dad to actually come in, because they felt that they had control, but Dad, he said, even if you refuse me to bring food, I'll still bring food. That is how we started. And the children would come out of the tents and follow the bus, because they knew MCF brought them food. For a whole year, the year 2008, we gave out food to these children... over 2,400 children every single day. MUENI: We ended up working with the Red Cross. And we got some of the children from the IDP camps, and some of them came to MCF, where they now have a family. MULLY: We are one family. We are one Kenya. Regardless of the tribe they come from, we take them. In Africa, we can only move forward only when we trust each other. Girls and boys, should we clap for your own brothers, your own sisters? Should we clap for them? ISAAC: MCF never stops growing. Every time we have disasters happen, we have (indistinct). We have parents that end up dying, they leave kids, you know, without any parents. We take them. And I think that's part of what the world is today, and I don't think there is one day, we will say, "enough is enough." It's not the kind of business or way like, we wanna do this for one year and we're done. This is a lifetime thing. After high school, Dr. Charles Mully took me to university. After graduating, I went back and did a Masters in psychology, and now I'm working with NGO based in Atlanta, Georgia, in Marietta, and I realize Dr. Charles Mully's dream and prophecies are coming to pass. They're becoming doctors, they're becoming teachers, they're becoming managers, they're bankers. It's amazing. Not counting the 84 who are currently in the Kenyan universities and colleges. One day, the Lord may take me home, the eternal home. Then they could be able to manage this place, but I don't have one particular person, not even my own son or my own daughters, because this is not my doing, this is not my property, this is not my work. He chose me like He did to Moses, to be able to do this work faithfully. That's why, over the years now, I'm no longer worried. I cannot tell the world who are those people who really would take over when I am not alive. Twenty-five years from now, I know MCF will be a place where the people will come from all over the world to see what is going on, and I know the kids who went through in our program, I know they will be big people in the society, and also in Kenya, and also in Africa, and maybe in the world. I know there's no limit in MCF. For you to be here, for you to be alive today, it's a miracle. For you to be the way you are, it is God's miracle. Let me tell you, I worked 25 years, and I worked because I know everything is possible. I'm telling you, let's remain focused in our studies, and in everything that we do, let us remain focused. Let us work hard, so that we change the world. DICKSON: At night, Dad ties his shoes up, puts on a coat, gets in a car, and he drives and drives, not somewhere specific, but looks until he sees an orphan, sleeping alone in a street. And the first thing he says... Oiyeh. Oiyeh. Oiyeh. ( children singing in African dialect ) ♪ ♪ ♪
