* GUNFIGHTERS * Brazos! Brazos! Look for Brazos. I am here. I'm sorry, Brazos, it was something superior to me. I had to find out which one of us drew faster. It doesn't matter, Tom. That's the harm of being famous for shooting. All young people in the country end up challenging. How are you kid? He will survive. This time, there were no deaths. Take it. Your weapons. Stay with them. No gunslinger can hang his weapons, or even put them aside. Karye!... Do you believe that? I will not survive two days without these weapons and I do not want their death on my conscience. Wont have. Good luck, Tom. I leave my weapons and this city forever. It will be the same, wherever you go. No, not this time, I'm meeting my old friend Bob Tyrell and riding on the prairie. See you soon, Brazos. See you later... when your best friend challenges you, you must leave the weapons. It was the same in Panhandle, Wichita and Dodge. Living or dying depended on who drew the gun and fired. Now, all of that is part, of the past. Goodbye to revolvers and rest in the peace I never had. This is the opportunity to start, a new life, in a new country. And for a day, a little cattle, and draw water from the wells instead of the guns from the holster. Go ahead! The end of our trip. Down there is the old ranch Inskip farm, where I'm going to walk through the grasslands, with Bob Tyrell. Do not shoot! Is this the Inskip Ranch? Hey, inside! Easy guy. Bob Tyrell... "BANNER RANCH" Bard, there was a murder. Yeah? Where? I don't know, but there's a guy, in the house talking to the old man. Huh, huh!... Why did you come here? You have the nearest ranch, so I decided to stop by and let you know. Yeah, I understand... He was shot in the back. He was called Bob Tyrell. How do you know the name? Didn't he say that when he arrived he was dead? He was an old acquaintance. Have you visited Inskip again? Yeah, of course, how can I not? This is a problem they have, horse ranches and two other cows, which they cannot defend either themselves or anyone else. Anyway, Bard, send a man, to report to the Sheriff... no, wait, better call helper John. Do not worry if you are upset, I have the idea of ​​such an agreement. What did you say your name is? I didn't tell you. Ah, well, it doesn't matter. It is too late for a stranger, to pass, completely unarmed. Sleep in the back room. Ok. Thank you, but I'm staying in the city. And take care of your horse too. This is a precious horse. However, he looks tired. Who's right. You know I have! Let me tell you something. I am tired of so much indecision. I want the killers to be taken and always arrested in prison. Do you want to be busy? We took care of this alone for many years, without getting in trouble. We can return to the weapons whenever we want. I will think something! Always the same, disgusted like a frightened pig. Listen, my friend! This time, I will serve the culprit on a tray. Hey, where do you think you're going with my best spurs? Now, it's yours? Listen Jane... Put them back where you found them... As soon as... finish with them. Yes father. There is no reason why we should not end this matter quickly, it is what I want. So will be. More will be worth you. If you don't like my job, Vagner, I can go my own way. In your place, I wouldn't even try. He is well known for doing this. Don't you think it can stop me? No, I already know that not. Suppose I appreciate you. Good luck. This is him. He's under my orders, get on the horse. He's wrong. First I'll give you a drink, then I'll see what you want. I'll tell you another way, arrested for murder. I understand. They did not find the weapon. You must have shot in the stream. It doesn't matter, I didn't find the bullet that killed the boy either. Didn't you find her? Do not. So you should go back and look, right? It wouldn't work! What do you mean by that? The killer may be interested in that bullet someday. Come on, come on, mount. Inskip... Inskip? What's up with him? Didn't you say you didn't know him? I’ve never seen him, in my life, but I would like someone, the sought after as soon as possible. Come this way! Johnny! Johnny, where's Mr. Inskip? Bob Tyrell. I'm sorry, Johnny. Where's Mr. Inskip? Mr. Inskip! A stranger came to us, was arrested and... Wait, wait... Wait a moment, slowly... Slowly, speak slowly to be understood. A stranger, stuck on, our ranch, stuck on our ranch, was asking for you. Yes, yeah? You always stray so much of the way? When there are questions, that require, do. Just think about escaping. Tie your hands, Tali. As you wish, deputy. That and what I want. Hold your horse, Rick. On here. Examine the pockets, saddlebags and also the blanket. Check the saddlebags. We know you killed him, why? Would telling the truth change your plans? Not even a little. So, this is how I imagined it. Whitey, put the rope on the branch. We do not shoot unarmed men in these lands. Better to hang them, isn't it? There is a letter and the usual things. Give me that letter. You can pass the loop. Still! Why are you here? It is not your place! I heard that they were calling me! If you need us, we'll call you. Did you want to see me for something, son? Bob Tyrell. Get out of here or arrest you. Shut up! Eh, ha!... I just want to get close to the boy, listen to what he has to say to me. Hey, he's running away! Catch him! "MEXICAN BORDER, 81 MILES" "BANERTOWN 3 MILES" Your visits must have been the usual ones. I like it as much as you do. Then nothing. Tell me what happened this time. I'm here, to arrest Inskip. I swear, Sheriff, I just wanted to help and nothing more. We asked some questions, suddenly that old man came and released him. He had to do something. It was clear that the man wanted to escape. Oh yes? Come on, Sheriff... the man confused me. That's it. No, it's not right! Let's go. Give me back my letter. It's not him? Yeah. How did you hear about Inskip, so timely? I knew Bob Tyrell. And I wanted you as a brother, I suppose? And that's why it was, to the cabin to pick you up? Bob was a good friend of mine. Too bad he can't confirm it. Yes, he can. Come on, take this letter. Let me see. Yes, signed by Bob Tyrell, addressed to friend Brazos. And you do not? Hmm!... I have nothing against this Brazos, but I don't think it is for me. Brazos Kane! Brazos! Brazos Kane! Kane, the Panhandle war sniper? No, you are confused. Don't trust him! Oh, oh, you are kidding? You do not remember me? Yeah, but I guarantee your mother remembers. The night I was born, I walked 20 miles to bring the doctor. If I weren't there, today you wouldn't be here. Don't you remember the spurs I gave you? Well, you may not want to remember. Who knows, are you ashamed of poor Joe? Of course I remember, my ugly old man Ai Brazos, it almost breaks my heart! Can't it be little Mike? Course is! To look! Well, let's get this over with. Prepare him a nice dinner and put it on my account. The best of what he likes. It can save your money! Don't you think about leaving this killer? See it another way. Your men have a dry throat. Let's go to the bar for a few drinks. I'm paying! Come on, what are you waiting for? And... old Inskip, a double dose. Come on, executioner! Have a good time! The village coffers will suffer a little. As you can see, these people are dead, trapped, sleeping with a fly on their nose. I feel like we can't expect, a man like you to stay, because it seems to me, do you like action It may be the place I'm looking for. Yeah? Hmm... Wait a minute, aren't you saying that seriously? There is something you should know. This is our worst moment. Dust storms, tornado or other, heat... One day, when crossing the street, my horse caught fire! Have you ever thought about California? Sometimes. I knew you would understand me. Not that I expect you to have problems, what happens is that sometimes some are wrong and... after a murder they run, you know... I would also like to get out of here. Thanks. Explain that to Inskip, tell him I have something pending. I wish you luck on the trip. I'd like to go with you. Hey, a moment! This is not the way to California! It's just a shortcut! Hello, Mr. Banner! What are you doing here? He knows... can you lend me a clove? I thought the patrol had taken him. So-so. How? We split up on the way and joined the sheriff at the end. I do not understand. What did the Sheriff say? He was talking about the California weather. California! That I would like to go there. And that carnation? My horse is about to lose the horseshoe and I don't like to lose anything. The carnations are there. Thank you very much. This is conflicting, right? My name is Orkut. I killed Paco Winters at Dodge. You've heard of it. No way. They say the ranch should be more lively. Get something for the boy to eat. Yeah. If you were late, I would have to be part of your job. Something had to end. Huh, huh, huh!... Find a bed in home for you. Right Still looking for the clove? The horseshoe had nothing wrong. That's what I thought. You still have it, don't you? I have that? You do not have?... Oh, oh, yes... So I believe. Did you tell anyone about this? Well, no... at least as far as I can remember. I want you to know that I thank you very much for what you did for me. In fact, it was nothing. Oh yes... Yes, I had no right to do that. In any case, it was very kind of you. Tell me... I'm crazy? No, no, I thought it was cute. Why? Well... what are we talking about. From your gift, I suppose. Listen, don't take offense, but there's a history of people with mental disabilities in your family? There seems to be, a lack of memory. Ah, well, it doesn't matter, you can return it to me. I wanted to keep you forever. Oh forever? For what reason? Like a memory. It must be used, to hang a man. Wait a moment! What did you give me? A rope? This morning, in the trough, I put a bullet in his hand. How? It was the bullet that killed Bob Tyrell. Give it to me, girl, because I need it! She doesn't have the bullet. I have. I must look like an idiot, they don't look like anything. Sorry, I take back what I said about mental illness. I am the retard. Don't worry, it suits you. Can it be trusted? I wait. She's my sister. Yeah, that's what I thought. You mistook her for me. Come over! Hello, precious! There is no lack of those who flatter me. What is wrong with you? Did something happen? When a man does something, you must try to do well. Oh dear, see how badly mounted! I will fix this. Did the package finish running? Okay, I'll fix it. Lift your leg. You will not find it, it is no longer there. Ah yes? Where? Where can I find it, if you want. Oh yes, you should want to, right? Do not tell me what to do! Here you are just a worker, nothing more! Only that? Come over! Okay, I'll get your bullet. So I like it better. You always get what you want from me. That's good for you. You should stay here. The city needs to see a little order. I believe it is in order now. Será melhor It will be better to bring the bullet to you. Wait a moment Save it for me. Hi! Hello. Inskip is not there. Thanks! I'm practicing. I can watch be my guest. Hmm!... My friend Bob Tyrell was killed here yesterday. gunslinger grass, a certain Brazos Kane. Bob was after cattle thieves, who stole small ranches. He told me that they threatened him. As almost always, when working, for an important farm. That is why I am practicing. Listen, Bill... my name is Johnny O'neal. Do you think you will have time, to draw like that? Why don't you try to draw the gun? Apart from that? How? Put on, this belt... belonged to my mate. Put it, you won't mind. We will... Put it on! He is fine. But that's a shame. Why? When you kill that Brazos Kane, did you know that he will be a marked man? Everyone drunk in the country will challenge you. Keep your hand open when running and drag it gently. About? Do this more slowly several times. You cannot kill a man and forget about him. The one you kill will have friends, the more you kill, the more enemies you will have. You can become famous, or end up underground. Eh! I understood! Place your finger on the trigger and pull the slider. And pull the trigger when you think it will hit. See how easy it is? After a while, when you're famous, and if you're alive, even your best friend, you will see that he is bound to challenge you and kill you if you can. Oh, you're overreacting! What can be better than that? Thank you sir! It was nothing... I hope you change your mind about Brazos Kane. Why do you care about him? I can't help it, I'm Kane. Do not do it, please. Do not do it! This is another lesson. What I say must listen without thinking for a long time. Johnny, I didn't kill Bob. Come on, you have to heal this. Bess! Jane! That's what I was saying. This is the western United States. It is? And this is the east, of the Rocky Mountains, just a big meadow, a refuge for buffalo. Before it was a cowboy's paradise, but we lost everything. First the small farmers arrived, then the fences, the plows... and now the pastures are gone forever, and the wind sweeps the prairies, night and day. The boys dug a new shelter right there... And now again the usual problem. Small farmers surround the land, then plow in and cultivate the land until the pastures disappear. You know what? I believe, that this phenomenon occurs as one, of the most significant things that we have ever had here. You said you spend your days with them! Listen, you two, making sure that no one ends the pastures and keeps them untouched. But, are you aware of the terrible events that you may encounter someday after my death? Where? Working on selling drinks! hmm!... Do you know what I would like to learn? When do you want to see Mr. Banner? Now is a good time. Study the map! Is it so weird, something wrong with you? It is clear. You better forget about this Bard McKey. Our father was also a cowboy! I know, but this is different. And that foreigner you look at so much? Brazos? Oh, I just... Do you like him, huh? And does he already know? Maybe I can seduce you. With those riding pants? Why don't you put on one of my dresses? Who wants. Except for silk. Bess, there is something wrong with you! What happens to you now? Here it is difficult to find, help, everyone works, for Banner, and when he finds, a small farmer like me spoils him like a gift from heaven. He's very diabolical, that's why he has so much land, so much land that almost everything, around it is also dirty. Better for your daughters. Not bad, huh? He talks like Johnny. This Bess Banner is so cute like a newborn foal, in a poor man's stall. I think it must be more beautiful, to have cattle and their own ranch. Yeah, whenever I don't kill you in bed with time. Do you know that we have no idea who killed the boy? Yes, we already have. Come here. I've been looking for clues. The two horsemen I saw, had no, very careful when they came around. I did not see anything. I wouldn't go through anything. Who wears boots like that? Made to measure. Which means that there is no other like it. This boot was not bought in Bannertown, it is not in the store. What about small farmers? These guys have never seen a boot in their lives! Can we find him? Meet you? With this proof we will have to find him! Yes! What does she want? That one? It will depend on who you are. Well! How are you? Fine. I just came here to... I thought... Why don't you go out? Dinner is ready. It has cookies. No thank you. My dad wants to know if he can count how many animals Mr. Inskip has on the mountain. Johnny got that number this morning. Oh... I didn't know. Speaking better, I look for a horseshoe nail. I just put all the carnations in the coffee. Why don't you have a coffee? Oh... We will... I suppose so. This is a very special occasion, I rarely come here. You should come more often. I say one thing, jeans never hook. I was informed. Hell... I should go see if we have enough food. Never take up arms? No, I don't wear the belt anymore. Doesn't know how much he would like me to say what thinks. I expected you to believe me. A man can try to live working with cattle, and it will not cost much money. There is a wonderful meadow just north of Sycamore Creek. Yes, I think I know where it is. I think I've been there. It would be a good place to set up a farm, with plenty of pasture for horses and... So I think... that there would be a stable on the bend of the river... Exactly as I thought! And to raise the house higher, among the high sycamores! With two rows of poplars on the six kilometers, of the path that leads to the house. Yes, exactly. And there, where... where the rapids jump over the rocks... What happens? It seems to me that we will have to put many things in order before we can do such a thing. We can do it. It may take longer than we think. It's Johnny! Him, you've been hit! Yes, they shot me, but I'm fine. Sit down. What happened? Bring him. They were taking my cattle! I surprised them in the theft! Why did not you tell me? I chased them all morning. Sit down, I'll take a look at this. Hey, wait! Wait a moment. This is my shirt! The arm is fixed, but the tear of the shirt does not heal! I was riding, to Sleeper Gap and suddenly, I saw a huge herd. About 800 prayers, guided by a dozen four willing to take them somewhere. And you didn't allow it? No sir, I ran to them, shooting! Wait a moment. Perhaps an inspection of the marks could prevent thefts. Hmm. Hey son! Why don't you do it tomorrow? I think your idea is a good one. I have to see a man. Brazos, it's time! Want a coffee? Black. Yes, I will serve you. This is my office, right? That's what it says at the entrance. It doesn't matter to us. Brazos, I think I would go to California. I'm weird, huh? Do it yourself! Why do you go to California when you are so afraid of being trampled? Inskip's cattle were almost stolen yesterday. Johnny surprised them. Fortunately, he fails, to recognize them. Happily? If not, they would have followed and killed himas they did Bob Tyrell. These are just guesses! This is my business. I'm a professional agent and I don't believe it... It's better to listen, if that supposes, boom! I know how you feel. They killed your friend and you want to do something about it. Skinner, we have to rule this place with your weapons or without them. We cannot leave this matter open! You can gather 50 men in the prison and at the corral gate, and if you leave this in my hands I can resolve without you firing a gun. Suppose we discover the culprit. All right. We have a deal. Which business? You said... You take care of everything whenever duty calls you. Hi! Tell me who am I? You are the savage. Can you help me take this to the priest? Sure, let's go ahead. Don't you take up arms? Why don't you go armed? Why? Are you so dangerous? Dangerous are you. I don't think it's, the great Brazos Kane, as they say! Miss, I am very happy that you think so. Eyp!... You know, Johnny O'Neil is right. Johnny? He told me that you were more beautiful than a violet vase in a cow's ear. And what did you say to him? To place pancakes. What? I think that's what I said. I don't understand you, is food the only thing that interests you? I just remembered. there is something else that interests me. I'm interested in you. Hi how are you? Is very? I think I care about you more than anyone who has ever worn boots. When did you find out? I suppose that's when I saw you riding. Due to the way you ride a horse. I'm glad you liked. I will never forget his silhouette, silhouetted against the evening light. Evening? Where were you? Right there, at the Inskip ranch. I've never been... Dad, I brought you a basket. You are too kind. Good people. Do you want help, father? No, thanks my son, I can alone. Please my greetings to your father and thanks for me. Goodbye son. Goodbye, priest. I never went to the Inskip ranch! Do not you remember? Make an effort. I arrived at that moment, I yelled at you and you waved your hand. It was not me, it's impossible. How can you forget, if it were such a special night? That's when they killed Bob. I was nowhere near the ranch! Of course, of course, maybe I was wrong. Nobody here is accusing anyone! Are you... I going up? Thank you, but I just remembered that I will be here all day. Goodbye Miss. I came to Brazos, special. Brazos, Brazos wake up! Hmm... Come on, it's time to eat. I ate when I arrived, a few hours ago. Eating is good for your health. What do you want to eat with the beans? Well, it could be anything. Nothing! Anything with beans will do! Susan, Maria, Pablo! Bring the beans, with salad, tortillas and tamales... Tamales! Hmm... Are you going to eat all this? Brazos can eat anything! I once, I saw him hit an Indian, and a quail for dinner, both with the same dose. How did you cook, the Indian? I didn't cook the Indian, what for? I cooked the quail! Are you surprised to see me? Not a lot. Maybe he was waiting for me, huh? I expected something, but I didn't know it was you. Huh, huh. I'm sorry to bother you, but you know, here we are willing, to kill many things. I'm sure of it. There are two things that we don't like very much. What? For example, we have our ways of talking to our girls. It's understandable. You told Bess Banner, that you were at Inskip's ranch when she shouldn't have. When a man says these things, we feel very bad. It would be a pity, to have, to repeat it again. Yes would be. But you won't be able to do that, because it's gone. I tell you, I've never seen a man leave this city so quickly. I'm sorry to hear that. Huh, huh!... And how... this should take time, but some will think that I can't shoot you, being unarmed. That sounds like nonsense, doesn't it? Hmm!... Possibly, I don't think that putting a bullet the bullet in your body changes my happiness a lot. I fully agree. I'm happy. Do you want to ask something more? No, I already know everything, I need to know. Gladdens me. If this is what I was eating, we needn't worry. You! Do you look for me? I'm looking for the Sheriff. The Sheriff is out of town. If he wants something, I'm on duty. Can you handle a murder charge if I give you the evidence? Against who? Sea Mackey, for example. Bard Mckey! Yeah, she knew it would surprise him. We both know more than we need, don't we? I should have hanged you that day! Tell your boss that things are going well. Brazos... go around! I'm sick of you! I'll take care of him, like Paka Winters did at Dodge. As you wish? Can it be Now. Let him go. If he takes care. Maybe I need you later. What an idiot! He was playing well with her cards, forcing Bard Mckey, to attack, but why did he have to argue with this Jonte? Now it got really bad. I'm cleaning Bob's gun for you. The way things are going... Okay, Johnny, but... It's a good revolver. I know. Thank you, but I will tell you something you can do for me. Bring a message, to Jane Banner. Jane, huh? You know what? These sisters are more silly than the white butt of an Indian! Sure, sure... Say that I want to see you when later tonight. You have a sister, we could... It's not a party, save something for me. Hair curls? Something I need to hang a man. Ah, a telegraph pole? Yes, a telegraph pole. I already have the bullet. Yes... let's go... it's a little late for that. Don't you think we can leave a man alive who knows you saw who killed Bob? What did you say? I told him to get out of town. Do you think... that he will?... No, I suppose not. It just shows that we have to forcefully convince him. That without him being armed? This is a problem in your hands. It will never end! Inskip and Johnny will fight, they will not let you go alone. It will be better if you come alone. I will not go! It is much better than you! It sure kills you. That's right! Listen, your father fights a lot, these pastures. long time. There are parts of this country for which you have had to pay a high price. A man killed for miles. Not worth it! What your father created was not just a ranch, it's more than that, it's like a kingdom. And do you know who built it for? For us both. Of course, let's build something, in a corner for your. Hello! He said many times, for you not to walk around! And that goes for southern Colorado and New Mexico as well. And other grazing extremes? Kansas and Nebraska? Well, because I, if it were for me, I couldn't go to them one day! It is true! Listen, Johnny, I think... God, you know what? Today it looks more beautiful than a basket of lemon pie and a bouquet of flowers. It's very kind. I was thinking about the way. Why don't you take the pie somewhere else? Listen, listen... Brazos has to talk to Jane, it's very important, otherwise a horrible thing will happen. All right, I'll tell you. Do you know where you can be? Hi how are you... mission, after dinner. Now, please get out of here. Everyone from here to Mexico knows that he challenged Bard Mckey. I recognize that I am playing a little high, Johnny, but in this game nobody cuts the deck twice. What happens? Put the flashlight on the nail. We'll be better off in the dark. Hey, is Brazos Kane there? It depends on who you are looking for! Do we bring you a letter from Jose! Jose? One moment... I'll get a flashlight You better not go. Otherwise, everyone will be after you. What good, is the mission for you? Then, a very hot night. Do you like that kind of weather? Just a moment... I keep thinking that you and your sister are not much alike. Always my sister... I thought she depended on me! However, I am happy to have come Mr. I want Jane to talk to me. Can't I talk to myself? I see, you want me to leave, city too, it is not? Not exactly. Don't you fear that I don't feel welcome? You're welcome! You should just let it cool down a little bit. Do you... want me, to disappear for a while? Why not? You have many Brazos enemies. I've been thinking about Aunt Billy. And Bard Mckey? Don't underestimate, Bard Mckey! You can get many men, to fight you. He can do that, I'm sure! Look, you said you were interested in me. How much are you interested in? What is needed is what I know. Enough to get rid of this mess, if I promise... I mean, am I like a cool wind? Better as a fresh wind than dead! Better for whom? Don't you think you're thinking of staying? Do not. What do you think I do here? There is another reason. What are you hiding? I swear I just want you to leave now. Are you in love with Bard Mckey? Imagine if I'm in love with Bard Mckey. I was already waiting. Johnny came to get me and said, you would be here. Did you have a problem distinguishing us, Brazos? No, it distinguished us very well. It doesn't matter anymore, now he's one of us. I was wrong with you and I didn't have time to figure it out. I don't like gunmen as much as Bess. At least, I know what suits me! If you want to go to the race with him tonight, I will help. They are just saying nonsense. The only thing that interests me is the bullet. I do not have this. I threw it into the bushes as far as I could. Do you believe now, that I abandoned you? I don't believe anything, what you said tonight. Now I know where that bullet is. Why do you want us to go, if you are in love with him, I know you are? I prefer that you go with him, as a way to end everything. Only that? I know you have the bullet, and why. Did you tell anyone? You know I would never do that. Oh, Jane, I'm sorry for everything... We have nothing more to say. See, blessed be Miss. Bessie! On the right time. Look, look, honey bread! I just did it, I don't know how they got, there, Mr. Inskip, I have to look for Brazos! Not here. Here, try a little... They are looking for you. Yeah, I know, I know, they want to kill you, they had already told me. Is he armed? Not that I know... look!... do you want to know, the secret of this bread? Didn't you manage to convince Brazos to leave town? It's the only thing Bard Mckey wants. Oh yes... wait a moment sister... Why is she now interested in Brazos? Why... Because I'm in love with him. And I don't like you to insist, that they kill you. You should go. Don't worry, you'll do it when the time comes. But there is no time for that. Right now Bard Mckey, is waiting at Monument Rock, with a big detachment! Oh, and you were there with them, weren't you? And what does it matter? The thing is... Tell me, why did you send her here? They didn't send me here! Well there must be, a reason for doing this. I just want to warn you! That doesn't seem to me, but it's how they send a girl, to convince an unarmed man. If it doesn't help me to say anything... how Brazos Kane? Or who knows, Bob Tyrell? If you don't want to pay attention, whatever happens, it will be his fault. Who's on Monument Rock? Does not matter! I suppose you will tell us, that you have not found it. In fact, it is so! Did it take, didn't it, how long it took? Inskip was there. We talk about gingerbread! Ginger bread? He did a little and wanted me to taste it! You do not know nothing! Ginger bread? It wouldn't hurt to hunt for dinner. Why don't you go up this hill and see what you can find? Huh!... To hunt? Yes, hunting. Keep your head on the job, whether I pay you or not. To hunt. Yeah, to hunt. Monument Rock... Very good! Hello!... Hello!... Hello!... Hello, are you hiding? Get out of this hiding place and let me see your face, if you're not ashamed! Get out! I want to see the face of the man who killed Bob Tyrell! I know who you are! I'll get you! Let's show up!... Mr. Inskip! Brazos!... Brazos! What happened?... What was there? Where's Brazos? Is there!... I've been looking for you, all day. Inskip? Yes. You're going, right? Not yet. He put his revolvers. These are from Inskip. I know you're going to look for Mckey. Ah yes? Bard did not do that. I spoke to Inskip this morning, and Bard has been with me ever since. And that proves something, doesn't it? Going after Bard won't do you any good. This is not just a cattle ranch this is a huge kingdom. Do you realize why you can't enter the city? You should tell me a little bit more clearly. I cannot say more. I know who can. No Bard... will need to kill him little by little. No, I don't think he talks... but I know someone who will speak. If you go, I will go with you. I will go with you now, wherever you go from here. Do you have any idea how, a fugitive travels? Men of war took women and managed to maintain their march. I'm not much different from Jane, Brazos. I will reward you in every way... Would you do anything for Bard McKey? Everything you've done, it's for him, it's not? He could even go, with another man to help him. You do not understand. When you love a man, no matter how bad he is... I understand. I understand that, but you know that it can only have one ending. Yes I know. I had nothing else, neither here nor anywhere... Please don't kill him, Brazos. Please do not! Brazos, I can use my hand. Let me go with you. The brand of weapons, Johnny. It cannot be removed Johnny, that's it! Brazos, I'm happy to meet you! Brazos, you must not enter this city. See this street? Is she at peace? The city does not appear. to be full of men. That is... I wouldn't say it's Saturday night, until I hear your silence. A great silence, yes. No screams, no fuss, no music. It reminds me of the moment when the horse calms down, just before running and breaking. It looks like a warning. Yes, it is a warning, for a man who is going to be killed. Brazos, all that silence, is for you. I think I've seen you before too. Where is Jonte? Ah, don't mess with Jonte. The other day I saw them fighting on the street, I didn't act because you were unarmed, but with guns... Remember that the badge on my chest doesn't die. Get up and pick it up again, stuck in another man's shirt. If you are against a police officer, I will have to go after you. I will have no other option. Yes, I already know. Go wherever you want, now. I will not look back. Goodbye Sheriff... Brazos Kane has just entered the city! I saw where he left his horse. I put two men to watch. This is not enough for him. Do you know what you came to do? I think he's looking for you. I'm not hard to find! Well guys, it looks like tonight, is a search night. I want you to move around the city, in groups of two or three. As soon as they find him, they'll pick me up at the Sheriff's office. Well, it invaded the wolf's mouth. I suppose he knows he will be arrested? There are many men out there. Many, for one man. I suppose if I shoot, the fire will spread through the door. You can bet on that. Let's take a look. He is relaxed, preparing a drink. He's just cleaning his gun. They didn't dare, huh? I don't think about serving, Brazos. You should, because I'm going to shoot you. Put your hands down, take a look at the street. I will keep my hands wherever I want! I will not fight you! It is not necessary. You just have to talk. I have nothing to say to you. Don't think about my shots, count my gun. Are you okay Bill? Yeah! Yeah, very well! I'm just shooting. Go do what I said! Just a moment! What will you do? Left arm or shoulder? I speak. I'm listening. Banner is looking. We all worked for him, saving Kinkaid who came back. Why did you kill Bob Tyrell? Bob surprised them by stealing cattle from all the farms. Well, that is enough for me. Inverted March. There he is! He's Brazos! Behind him! He's Johnny! Yeah, Brazos... Keep your hand... open and then... remove heart... Then... Jane! I was hoping to find you here, Jane. Tell me, did you see anyone? I do not. It's a very strange night, so peaceful... I wish I could continue like this. Maybe we can both do this. Brazos, why did he get, the guns back? He had to unmask Jonte. He told me the whole story, Jane. I knew it too, Bess told me everything. Brazos.... Please don't drag my father. I know... I recognize that I was very wrong, but... but all he did was for Bess and me. How can I... hate him and wish him death, if all you did was for the love you had for us? I cannot ask you for this. And can I ask you? I'm afraid not. But how... but this is going to erect, a terrible fence between us. Brazos, there has to be a way to take him down. You have many ways to do this, Jane. I hear! It's okay, it's nothing. Don't you remember what you said to me? The country is changing and we will not need weapons. I was wrong. It's changing, but the exchange came too late for us. You see? It is a fight that you cannot escape. We can always be, guided by this. There is not a single man like you! You are not even safe with me! You are taking your life and destroying mine too. Do you believe that I will live if you die? I'm sorry, Jane, things have to be this way. I understand why you only have, one answer for everything, guns! Even my own father... This is one way of looking at things. So everything was a lot of lies! He's just a killer and always will be! And you can never change that. I am prepared, to believe you now. You know that I won't be able, to live here or talk to you anymore. I did everything that was in my hands. All the men we have, are looking for you. Do you think they will bring you in? You don't have to bring it, just find it. This man is mine. A knight brought a message. I just don't know what it is. He is fine. I hope that's where Kane is. I hope one day, you get tired of shooting so much, Bard. There was no point, in killing Inskip. Oh, we didn't want to kill him, it was a mistake. It's the same, he's dead. You're going somewhere? Yes. You will spend the night More than one night. I was thinking, I should take a trip. Some nasty things are happening here. Is Bess going too? I don't know what Bess is going to do. Where will you be? I do not know. Don't you know?... Ah, you won't need these gloves right now. Will return before... Her first doll. I couldn't buy you a real one so I made it out of a piece of root. So you nailed it, your first teeth. When you were two, I brought another one for you. I brought it from Dodge, in my saddlebags. But she had no clothes. So I bought wool and cotton and we both made, a beautiful dress for her. Oh, daddy, please don't! Brazos Kane comes again! Kane? Is he surrounded, is he crazy? He's close, less than half a kilometer, and he's right here! I do not believe! It is not normal, in these circumstances. Why didn't you see how he did this to Billy Jonte? How do you want me to apply the law to you? In the stomach, or between the eyes? Personally, I prefer the stomach, but shut up! I will face this. I already told you he's mine. We gave him many opportunities to leave. You must take advantage of them It seems that it is not what he wants. Perfect to me. There must be another way out, of all this, there must be! We are in a position to have, to defend ourselves, I suppose. I don't think they met him! We have orders from the Sheriff's office. We could have peace in our pastures except for that man. Always and everything, right? And we don't need his advice. I know everything you've done! I wanted to make you believe, that I don't know anything, but I do! Were you talking to Kane? I was talking to my sister! Yeah and what did she tell you? I can't hide under two hats and a killer mark! How dare you tell me that? Look, it's time for a more serious consultation. Orkut! It already seemed to me that there was something wrong with her reputation, Brazos. Behind your back, huh? Inverted March. You can withdraw whenever you want. No, no! Brazos! I never thought you could betray me. I've been trying to tell you... Dad, I've been trying! I think I should believe it. There are parts of this country that you have to pay with a dead man per kilometer. It's not worth Bard, it's not worth it! Brazos! Okay, put those hands down. Thanks. You're welcome. Bard Mckey and Hen, Orkut are dead. And I can present evidence against Banner. Brazos has already been introduced, and against his daughter Bess too. Who? My brother. The truth seemed to pour out of the holes you made in Jonte. I will chase you from here to California, where I have no jurisdiction, for sure. This time I tell you seriously, get out of here. These weapons will no longer have notches in their stock. I'm not proud that I can't live without them. I'm sorry and I'm ashamed. Now I only have one thing to do. Try again Somewhere else. "THE END"
