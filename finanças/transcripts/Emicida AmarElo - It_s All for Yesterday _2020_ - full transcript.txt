"The curious ones will rejoice in my conclusions. For those who dismiss me, it's no use explaining what's already been rejected." By Mário de Andrade in "Paulicéia Desvairada," 1992. There's an old Yoruba saying that goes, "With the stone he threw today, Eshu killed a bird yesterday." This proverb is the best way to sum up what I've been trying to do. A NETFLIX ORIGINAL DOCUMENTARY Turn back home And put up my picture on your wall I wish I'd battle his ass one day When he's got the mic The rhyme goes only one way He's the shit I'm gonna tattoo his name on my hand This brother is his own brand When the mic's on He's never gone It doesn't feel like my first time here. I feel like I'm back. And that, somehow, my dreams and struggles started long before I was here. But we've got some contextualizing to do before it all makes sense. A picture of contemporary Black thinking in Brazil. That is what you'll be watching as of now. One. Brazil was the last country in the Americas to end slavery. MAY 13TH ABOLITION OF SLAVERY I DECLARE EXTINCT SLAVERY IN BRAZIL Two. The city of São Paulo got its wealth mainly from the mid-19th century coffee boom, and its production was slave-fueled. Three. The end of slavery left millions of Black persons to fend for themselves. It was followed by "whitening" policies that encouraged immigration from Europe, demonized African and Native cultures, and sought to completely purge not only the memory of slavery, but each and every contribution made by non-white people to this country's development. From the beginning, imperial authorities tried to "whiten" Black blood, in an effort to neutralize their culture and keep them from ascending to important positions. Four. The rise of São Paulo to the metropolis we know today as the "land of opportunity"… This is São Paulo, the capital of hard work, the giant made of reinforced concrete that grows bigger by the day. …is marked by a violent process of gentrification. Many areas ended up mischaracterized, mainly the central ones, which are traditionally Black. Gala at the City Opera House! Most of the Black population got pushed to the outskirts. Five. Poor people from other Brazilian regions came to the "land of opportunity" to try their luck, having the outskirts as their home, too. Cosmopolitan and multicultural, that is how the outskirts of São Paulo were born. Six. In the 1970s, the hip-hop culture is named in the United States, but impacts the entire planet. Through rap music, break dance and graffiti, young people from the city's outskirts found a means for expression. Their meeting point is an area easily reached by all of them, the historic city center, more specifically the São Bento subway station. Seven. Their music spreads across other outskirts in Brazil, turning into a solid movement that creates awareness on racism and social inequality. As dismissive as the recording industry was, it sold millions of copies and became the first far-reaching means of connecting the working class to Black Brazilian intellectuals. It's been linked to every working-class accomplishment since then. White people cannot understand the flamboyant outfits, with the caps and bright colors. Eight. Although rap music might be widely understood as a platform for complaint, it's been much more than that. Everybody wants to groove to that sound. In search of its essence, rap music enters the amazing universe of the Brazilian popular music, especially samba. The encounter is so powerful that both worlds are forever changed. The message couldn't be any clearer. We can go even further. Nine. Despite structural racism in Brazil, the new culture emancipates youngsters across the country. Economically, too. The digital environment allows independent artists to accomplish not only rare feats, but unprecedented ones, too. -The street… -Is us! The street is us! Ten. Getting ahead in life is much more than making money. Fame is not the only thing these kids aspire to. They want to rewrite our country's history. One more thing. You see, my mom calls me Leandro. But everyone else knows me as Emicida. I'm one of those kids. CITY OPERA HOUSE NOVEMBER, 2019 We're about to go on stage. Fifty years from now, we're gonna look back and think that this night changed the lives of many. This is our way of saying to people like us that they belong here. FOR RACIAL EQUALITY We absolutely have to be present in this space, this environment, and all other spaces we've been kept from throughout the history of our country. You know? The next generation of judges, doctors, lawyers, and also the next presidents, are sitting in there right now. Let's restore their right to dream. Okay? Thank you so much. This is what AmarElo is all about, y'all. We're in this together. Peace! Today I can consider myself a lucky guy Besides being very young I feel safe and strong And I've been thinking God is Brazilian And walks next to me I can't keep suffering For what has happened Enough bleeding, enough crying Last year I died Not this year, though Enough bleeding, enough crying Last year I died Not this year, though Last year I died Not this year, though Last year I died Not this year, though My dreams fly higher than drones What fuels me? Hunger To wreck everything like a cyclone Tomorrow cannot be the same old yesterday With a new name The vulture preys on us eager for a fall When sorrow is gone I'm so much more than this shit Body, mind, soul, Ayurveda-style Like water, I can flow through rocks I'm the playwright in this plot Every drama is hidden Urging you to step out of mud While flaming the world No melodrama, I'm after money God's plan in sight Capulanas, katanas, nirvana is the goal Though it's a rigged game for us Losing is not an option, right? From where the wind takes a turn Real talk sprouts Ain't gonna leave it alone Nor let it slide For we're about to baffle Those who laughed when we were down My grandma's never set foot there. She's 80. Wednesday is gonna be her first time. Will you play a song for me? -Is the camera really on? -Yep! That's what's dope about this. My mom, my aunts, my daughters, both of them, are gonna be there and see it in a different light, you know? Many of the boys and girls who will be there on Wednesday, they've never been to the City Opera House. That's why the venue matters, having a majestic venue matters. This is big and it's here, you know? It's not something new. We need to mark this occasion. I want them to leave thinking, "I won't let this get lost in the digital world." He's made the sun rise! He's back! The lunch lady gets off The bus leaves Miss Maria is far gone Only then the sun rises Spiders weaving their webs During the night, in darkness Breathless lovers in the grasp of Morpheus And the sun, it only comes out later The sun only comes out later It's the king star, I know Still, it only comes out later The sun only comes out later… I'll give you a literal example of the natural order of things. The sun rising on Sezefredo Avenue and setting on Fontalis. You feel me? Because Sezefredo Avenue stands higher. Watching from the hill, you can no longer see the shape of the houses at night. There are only the stars in the sky and the lights coming from every house in the hood. The lunch lady gets off The bus leaves SINGER Miss Maria is far gone Only then the sun rises Spiders weaving their webs During the night, in darkness Breathless lovers in the grasp of Morpheus And the sun, it only comes out later The sun only comes out later It's the king star, I know Still, it only comes out later The sun only comes out later… MUSICIAN Is it going to be a single? I don't really believe in singles. You do what you gotta do. You're right. The better the song, the less it plays on the radio. Word. I'm gonna do what I feel like doing, then it's up to them. I like to… Zeca! Zeca! Hurry! Come on! FILM - BLACK ORPHEUS -Here, play for the sun to rise! -I can't! -Of course you can! -I shouldn't! None of that! Just play! He's made the sun rise! Wow! Just like in the movie. And now you are the movie. The album is structured around a dream. You know what I mean? This guy goes to sleep, and in his dream, everybody is helping each other. It's a beautiful dream where people understand and support each other. That's his dream. "Principia" is that dream… Literally. That's why the beginning feels ethereal, wavering, even. OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY OF THE BLACK PEOPLE It starts out smooth. You can hear those old ladies from old-school neighborhoods, singing… It takes you back to your childhood, you know. Like a bedtime song by your mom. He's dreaming of this time when he felt cared for and understood. He starts connecting with plants like rue, and with religion, things that will help him have faith when the world is telling him not to. All we got is each other, and we gotta fight for it. All we have is All, all, all All we've got is each other All, all, all All we have is… You feel me? That's what I'm saying. We only have each other. If we let go of each other, we're screwed. All, all, all All we've got is each other All, all, all All we have is… Can't remember the other chorus! MARISSOL MWABA, INDY NAÍSE AND NINA OLIVEIRA - SINGERS All, all, all All we've got is each other All, all, all All we have is… The Catholic church bell would wake us up very early… SINGER …which is a paradigm shift, since the Catholic church condemned Candomblé. It was a beautiful message about how we're here to live in unison, not disconnected from one another. Nature has its own rules, but morality is a human thing. And humans use morality to drive each other away. I meant for the whole album to have this vibe of making us feel like one again. To bring us together based on what we have in common. So that's the first track. Towards the end, a pastor friend says these beautiful things. Really? That's awesome. What does it mean when Jesus says we should renounce ourselves? He's actually talking about our inflated egos, the egos produced by our society. Empowered by false pretenses and deeply lonely. Hello, my friend. -You good? -Yeah. It's as old as eternity Love is spirituality Latent, potent, black, poetry A shoulder in the quiet night A cozy lap to start the day Son, hug your mother… I started working on this song four years ago. I'm tearing up a bit, bro. Damn. Yeah, it could be If it weren't for love… The first time I was in Africa… my friend Chapa took me to the National Museum of Slavery in Angola. There, I found a basin… and the text on the wall read, "This was the basin used to christen Black people." "And because of a twisted Christian notion, they were led to believe they had no soul." I looked over at my pal and realized what my mission was. Every time I grab my pen or mic, I wanna be able to return to each of my brothers and sisters the soul they thought they didn't have. With the sweet scent of rue I think about Buddha, calm I'm very tense, so I seek help Sometimes I think about a psalm Clear my vision of all illusions Like an ophthalmologist And I, the one who sees beyond For myself, for you, ubuntu, a balm If I need to put my faith in something Gonna rely on what I can see Summarizing this world, small, little Mundane, dirty, hell, and poison Cold, winter, night drizzle Repression and regression Being calm is a luxury Life stresses us out I try to read souls beyond pressure Nations falling into those Barabbas hands Where the miracle lies This only proves the urgency of books In the face of the wreck caused by a saber In deep greedy debts Ignoring the meaning of blessings In a time Where the only thing running free Is our tears I came back to kill, like a heart attack After a resurrection, like a childbirth I rebuild myself, fed up, I put away Just an ordinary man, rooted in reality If I receive a blessing, I share I break into cells, living rooms, bedrooms I traveled the world, and now I'm sure That everyone is one All, all, all All we have is each other All, all, all All we have is All, all, all All we have is each other All, all, all All we have is ACT 1 PLANTING Nothing can teach you about time like soil can, bro. And this is no hippie talk. When you plant a seed, you gotta water it and wait around 15 days for it to sprout. Once it's there, you gotta take care of it, you know? You gotta watch out for pests and venomous animals. It's crazy how you find yourself having to deal with spiders and snakes, and how you come to understand that they won't bite you out of spite, you know? The last thing they wanna do is bite you. Spiders won't bite you because they feel like doing it. They do it because they get scared. And fear will push you to do things you don't wanna do, you know? While I worked on my album, having a garden taught me so much. I was being interviewed before the concert and the dude asked me, "Why the City Opera House?" "Because there's not a single beam, there's no bridge, there's no street, there's no important building that hasn't been touched by the hands of Black workers." When I said that, I was thinking of manpower, bricks, cement and so on. But this is only half of the story. To get the full story, we gotta rewind the tape and time travel, really. And the best time machine for this journey is an old samba-enredo by Geraldo Filme about Tebas. While doing some research on him, you quickly realize why he got his name from Thebes, a hood in Egypt from back in the days of the Pharaohs. Not only did Tebas lay bricks with his Black hands, but he was also a crucial part in the stylistic re-do that São Paulo went through in the 18th century. He built the steeples for the Carmo Church and the old São Paulo See Cathedral. TEBAS, FIRST BLACK MAN TURNED ARCHITECT IN SAO PAULO He built the Fountain of Mercy. All those panels at the See Square are credited to the artists. SINGER AND COMPOSER Neither the See Cathedral nor the Fountain of Mercy are credited to Tebas. But we know he made them. He's also the artist behind the foundation stone in St. Benedict's Monastery. The area around the monastery served as a foundation stone for our hip-hop, and that's crazy. Whether building or designing, the people who have always fought so that art and beauty could bring life to our city's cold concrete were ourselves. We, we, we We, we, we… We're free here Sweet-ass sneakers Some sweet-ass bling The whole thing flashes It bothers their asses Black people gathered around Are the GPS of what's dope If the ghetto's awake The rest can go to hell Sweet-ass sneakers Some sweet-ass bling The whole thing flashes It bothers their asses Black people gathered around Are the GPS of what's dope If we're here at the City Opera The rest can go to hell! Love Free, free, free Love, free We're free here I like to rewind the history tape 100 years back and think about how the year of 1922 turned shit upside down. As we celebrated the centennial of our independence, people from different origins born in Brazil reclaimed their right to dream and to transform this place, ignoring the ghost of colonialism that still haunted it. For example, a cultural movement of African roots, a modern and original one, is the precursor of what we now call brasilidade. It went straight from the favelas to the heart of the artistic avant-garde. I'm talking about samba, which was widely persecuted here in Brazil. Despite the strong disapproval showed by the local bourgeoisie, Pixinguinha and Donga introduced it to the modern city of Paris. And that's how Oito Batutas made history. We're the Batutas, Batutas, Batutas CONDUCTOR We come from Brazil All is well here We're the Batutas, Batutas, Batutas We get everyone to dance samba You know what's crazy? The same year samba conquered the world, a seismic shift occurred in our art and its epicenter was precisely the stage where I'm about to perform. The Modern Art Week of 1922. The notion of art around here was forever shaken. Sambistas, who are undeniably modern, and modernists, who, without realizing it, wanted more samba in our art, both broke with traditional ideas in a way that still echoes today and beyond. Although they were mainly an elite group of white men, but not limited to it, modernists reclaimed Brazilian art with Brazilian colors, and the Modern Art Week was only the beginning. Green and yellow were not forgotten, immortalized in the painting The Yellow Man, by Anita Malfatti. As for the sambistas, mostly poor men and women, almost all of them Black or biracial, they stood for what Machado de Assis would have called "the real Brazil." Both movements took a leap of faith with their art. They were saying, "We're all we got." I leave my tambourine to my friends They asked me if I'd ever met Mário de Andrade. I had the honor… SINGER …to have been his friend… and to have him quote me. You'd pay no attention to mine To me, you no longer have value Deixa Falar was the name given by Ismael Silva, Bide, Brancura and others to what would become the basis for samba schools. Why the name "samba school"? In this neighborhood, we had a normal school… where you could become a teacher. So the neighborhood Estácio de Sá spread the word that the neighborhood itself was a samba school. Estácio de Sá was a samba school. Bide created the surdo drum, and making it the heart of the percussion, as well as the tamborim. SINGER We're not sure who invented the tamborim, Bide or Ismael Silva. But old-school folks say it was Bide. He built a surdo drum using a butter can… and paper from a cement bag. He took the cement bag, then wet the paper, put it over that 20-kilo butter can, fastened it with wire, finished wetting the paper, warmed it up a bit with fire, just to improve the sound. Then he went down to Estácio Square. Bide went down there with Deixa Falar, and he's credited with inventing the surdo. They called on me Here I am, what's going on? They called on me Here I am, what's going on? I came from there When I was little I came from there When I was little… SINGER -I'm all about samba, bro! -You can say that again! -You can say that again. -Let's try it one more time. We only trust samba folks. -Only samba people can be trusted. -And is the only one trustable. Samba is Brazil at its finest. And there's no way our country can win if it moves away from samba. I am samba… Our band, Os Sete Modernos do Samba, performed in Mexico. It was also known in Spanish as Los Siete Diablos de la Batucada. I am samba… I'm a Rio de Janeiro native… I'm the one who spreads joy To millions of hearts… From Jovelina Pérola Negra to Jackson do Pandeiro, including Wilson Batista, and last but not least Jair Rodrigues, besides many other samba greats, Hip-hop was already there long before we existed. This bittersweet fruit we call rap grew from a big tree. If you examine its roots closely, you'll find samba there. I am samba… Samba really is out of this world. It can reach places no other living being's been to. For example, in 1997, the samba song "Ô Coisinha Tão Bonitinha do Pai" was chosen to wake up the Sojourner Rover in its space mission. Before any other cosmonaut, our samba touched Martian ground. Aren't you Daddy's little cutie pie? Aren't you Daddy's little cutie pie? Sambistas have always been avant-garde, true trailblazers. With all their weight, they could still bring on a light touch. An example is Johnny Alf's piano and voice. You know very well I'm a good fellow… Dubbed "GeniAlf" by Tom Jobim and regarded as the true father of bossa nova by many, he ended up an influence on musicians such as Elis Regina and Wilson Simonal. Pinky. Now I'm thinking of it as a movie, Nave. The way the album is put together, -it tells a story. -Right. It just hit me that "Principia" is about the brother's dream. -You know? -Damn… Damien's song is, when he wakes up, "A Ordem Natural das Coisas," which is like a "good morning." He sets out early morning for work. Suddenly, as this brother's leaving for work, his wife runs to the gate to say goodbye. "Pequenas Alegrias da Vida Adulta." For real, bro? We have to be careful While on the trapeze Even if modern times' desperation Weighs on us If a "like" is a call-out to hate, man In this case The message of common sense is simple COMPOSER If we stick together, we'll be fine. We'll outnumber them. We just have to stick together. "Pequenas Alegrias da Vida Adulta" has a little secret to it, and my man Oga Mendonça was the first person to uncover it. He grinned and said, "This song could use a sauce that rap doesn't enjoy enough, samba-rock." The birthplace of this type of samba is a tiny piece of Africa in the wacky-ass city of São Paulo, better known as North Side. Am I being provincial? Hell no. This was where the first recording bringing samba and rap together was officially born, with The Brothers Rap. Da Cor do Pagode made the introductions Pumping up this rap of the next generation 'Cause I wrote this rap That's kind of weird With a beating tambourine And a cavaquinho's chords Throughout the years, other artists tried the sauce, like Athaliba e a Firma, Rappin Hood, Marcelo D2, Quinto Andar, and Racionais MC's, among others. They gradually thinned out the Americanness in it, proving that it's impossible to appreciate the Brazilian melting pot without being influenced by the local spirit. Ambitious as I am, I say we climb up a step. As this whole movement matures, we're asked to move past the blend of styles to make way for a new genre, a new artistic language, something I've been calling "neo-samba" in AmarElo. "Alvorada no Morro" by Cartola, "Sonho Meu" by Dona Ivone Lara, "Bandeira da Fé" by Luiz Carlos da Vila, or even the famous "Trem das Onze" by our beloved Adoniran Barbosa, paint spot-on pictures, working as reliable historical documents, as hard-hitting as those songs by rappers to come, but in a different context. That's why there will always be partideiros. And the verses, even offhand ones, shall reflect the truth in each individual's soul. You know what I find so beautiful about sambistas? They never forget the little joys of adulthood. I will… Face everything for her Face all battles For the little joys of adulthood I will… I will… Be on the front like a warrior Even if I have to take on The entire planet Or run a marathon and win Shout out, "This is for you, babe!" I will… Face everything for her Face all battles For the little joys of adulthood I will… I will… Be on the front like a warrior Even if I have to take on The entire planet Or run a marathon and win Shout out, "This is for you, babe!" -I like that. -Me, too. -Well… -Beautiful! -Beautiful! -That was a no-brainer. -Good one. -It's got a lot of swing to it. -Cool, right? -Damn good. -Really good. -Bro, press Ctrl+S and save this shit, for God's sake. Can you imagine all of it gone? -Shall we? -One, two, three… Go! Play the rattle like you mean it. Got it? PESSIMISM PROHIBITED Sometimes I feel like a photographer, but not an ordinary one. I feel like the brother from Manoel de Barros's poem, who describes himself as a "photographer of the invisible." To me, writing is like being blessed with time-traveling. I can be right here, right now, but I can also visit the past and the future and share its feelings. I learned that from watching my mom work the soil. After I read about what it meant for Mandela to have a garden in prison, I was moved by the realization that so many wonderful thoughts could be enclosed in a seed. It was my mom Jacira and Nelson Mandela who taught me to respect time and connect to the cycle of life. This intensive exercise I did for years made me feel whole as a human being. Nothing in the world Could be more beautiful From the bottom of my heart From the deepest corner of my core To this wrecked world My writing is like a love letter Kids, laughs, windows Flirts, braids, yellow cotton The red shades of roof tiles The crackle of the spark Makes you feel inside a painting Hope paints itself in watercolor The white noise of the radio TVs and soap operas A trail of bees The murmur of sheep In your ears And life goes along On the paving stone Intrepid worker Impetuous driver Where it all starts The wind calms the speed down For every eclectic new sound Record players spin the classics Beautiful absurd Suffocating metropolis They are necropolises That never touch one another So they collide with someone's dream Sunday killers Pausing every beautiful thing Everyone who feels the same Is also my friend This one comes From the bottom of my heart From the deepest corner of my core To this wrecked world My writing is like a love letter From the bottom of my heart This one comes From the bottom of my heart From the deepest corner of my core To this wrecked world… I've always hung out at second-hand record stores. I'd look for records for hours on end with the little money I had. There was no room for mistakes. I'd read the spec sheets on the back of the records until I came up with a simple but effective methodology. If a certain name was on it, I could buy the record without a worry. His name became a seal of approval. He was my guardian angel of good music. So I started collecting records by this great musician. One day, I went to see my bros play at the Brasilintime festival, where rap DJs and big-time drummers played together. Only the bad boys. Ladies and gentlemen… it is my pleasure, my honor… and a dream of mine to introduce to you one of the best drummers in Brazilian history. Wilson das Neves! DRUMMER AND COMPOSER I was watching from up top and couldn't look at anyone else. All I could see was that baldy bringing it home, looking sharp as he played his drums. Years later, I was invited to a project where I could choose any artist to record with. I had my mind made up. I immediately remembered the name on the record covers. But what could I possibly offer someone who had already recorded with the titans of Brazilian music? I had to cheat. I wrote a song made entirely of phrases from songs he had recorded in the past. A tribute, truly. That's how I came face to face with the monster in the flesh. And we never parted ways. Lucky me! So thank you, Mr. Wilson For your sacred music Leninha wanted me to listen to the song. I told her I only listen to the songs when I record them! SINGER I'll forget by the next day. -Can't remember what I ate yesterday. -Remember Wilson das Neves? My buddy Wilson, sure. We'd been traveling around and working together-- -He wrote the melody? -Yeah. -Holy fuck! -We used a sample of his. -I think I should listen to it, then. -Don't worry. I should've listened to it. For a long time we fought to prevail as a relevant art form. We've built that over the past years, like the last ten years, feel me? Now for the last decade, even a little before that, we've had nothing to prove to anyone. But surely, our art is in constant evolution. We've been able to develop a form of expression, defining the contours of Brazilian rap music. When you have a friend You have everything When you have a friend You have everything I pity the fool who messes with us. I've been tripping over this idea for the last five years. Even before it got this bad, I realized we needed something to hold on to. There are certain values that needed settling, like the importance of believing. This one's gonna fuck me up! It's like rappelling If you're out of rope, you die AVUÁ FASHION SHOW Chilling Even with darkness around the corner Damn, I almost forgot! I design clothes every now and then, and we put on fashion shows. It was late night and I was finishing some pieces for our next show at SPFW. The last edition had been amazing. We paid a great tribute to samba. On the most important runway in Brazil, we featured my mom, Mrs. Jacira, Fabiana Cozza and Wilson das Neves. Ladies and gentlemen, Wilson das Neves. Samba in the flesh! What a wonderful feeling it is to present people you admire with flowers while they can still smell them. A call came in that night, while I was working. My wife brought me the phone wearing a serious look on her face. I answered the call, and my friend, Margarete, gave me the sad news. Our beloved master, Wilson das Neves, was no longer among us. I cried for days. But my grief was always cut short by some funny memory. I'd remember him saying, "Only scoundrels die, son!" And Wilson couldn't be more right, as usual. A few months later, I was able to pull out a cassette he'd sent me and listen to all of it without crying. I listened to all his tunes non-stop. Thiago Jamelão and I headed to the studio and we tried to harmonize them. Once in the studio, we had a dreamlike moment testing chords for a long time, and when I woke up, we had a perfectly round cycle. His music filled the studio and I could feel his presence with us, as strong as ever. I smiled as I thought, "When you have a friend, you have everything." When you have a friend You have everything If the well devours you He rescues you from the bottom The feeling is so amazing That all the stress seems easy to overcome It's a safe place For when things get too insane When you have a friend You have everything When bullets are flying, brother They turn into a shield Ready for anything, for real, anytime A shoulder to cry on after the Armageddon Being brothers like Gil and Caetano Is a rare thing in this crazy world I've found so many hardships But I made it back And I'm gonna keep on going It's like the Baroque Rococo style Of which Aleijadinho was king The gift of gods So many laughs Like in catechism I've asked Oxalá and Our Lady Hey, what floor do you live on now? Gonna pay you a visit someday These are my favorite verses. So, Mr. Wilson passed away. So I ask, "What floor do you live on now?" My favorite parts until now… Going through all that gets me thinking of Oswald de Andrade, another modernist. In his Anthropophagic Manifesto, he said exactly that. "Other people are all that interests me." After all, there's no meaning in our existence without others. Samba knew that from the start. ACT 2 WATERING Jaime de Almeida was a fullback for Flamengo. Five-time champion with his team. During one of his practices, Jaime's family got a proposition from one of the club's managers. He wanted one of Jaime's little sisters to work as a maid in his house. Years later, during an interview, this is how the little girl would tell the story. "We had just lost our father." "I babysat for rich women for a while." "Black children start working early on, you know." "This manager from Flamengo offered me a job at his house working as his little maid, the type who becomes the house pet." "I put up such a fight that they had to bring me back." The little girl grew up. She majored in Philosophy and History, becoming a major thinker and a reference for extraordinary individuals of our time through her beautiful and powerful ideas. Her name is Lélia Gonzalez. The Egyptians were a Black people. Thus, the Egyptian civilization, the first civilization ever to exist on planet Earth, passed on all the knowledge to the so-called Western civilization. PHILOSOPHER AND ACTIVIST To Lélia Gonzalez, the key contributions made by Black people created Brazilian culture itself. As a result, we don't speak Portuguese around here. We speak Pretoguese. Many people believe that Lélia is a pioneer in intersectionality studies, which is how social identities overlap and relate to structural oppression, sort of. RACE, SEX AND CLASS OPPRESSION A theory that has only recently become popular in our society. Let us fight, comrades! So that exploitation and oppression in our country may come to an end. NATIONAL BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS DAY Brazil is not a racial democracy. Before it could ever become an actual racial democracy, our country needs to effectively become a democracy. Lélia explained that oppression against Black women is even harder… AGAINST BLACK WOMAN'S EXPLOITATION …as it's underlined by gender, class and race discrimination. They're discriminated against three times more. In its almost 450-year history, the city of São Paulo had only seen two Black women elected to the State Assembly. The first woman to ever be elected was Theodosina Ribeiro, and the second is a sambista… SINGER AND COMPOSER …who also performed in the City Opera House in 1975, the godmother of rap, Leci Brandão. A new leader is rising On Pau da Bandeira Hill A new leader is rising On Pau da Bandeira Hill On Pau da Bandeira Hill On Pau da Bandeira Hill Let me hear you clap! As I see it, this achievement by Leci was as daring… LECI BRANDÃO: WOMAN, BLACK AND HOMOSSEXUAL …as when she became the first woman to be a composer for Mangueira. The initial reaction was pretty predictable. A girl wanted to join the very traditional Mangueira composers. No woman had ever knocked on their door. When I did, I got my message across and managed to convince those distinguished gentlemen. Candeia founded the Recreational Club Black People's Art Quilombo Samba School. It wasn't just a samba school. As the name implies, Quilombo stood up for freedom during the years of lead, both in verse, such as the samba-enredo "Ao Povo em Forma de Arte," and in prose, by giving rise to organic intellectuals such as the masters Elton Medeiros, Paulinho da Viola, Wilson Moreira and Nei Lopes. It worked as a true school of popular culture. Professor Lélia Gonzalez was also a master at this school. Lélia offered Candeia a seat in her jalopy to join her on an important trip to São Paulo. Candeia was already in poor health, so he wasn't able to come along. Her jalopy let her down, too, and broke down on the way there. But that didn't stop Lélia Gonzalez from coming here to represent Candeia and Quilombo. Her destination was the front steps of this building. She attended the first public demonstration of an organization that would transform our history. It was the founding of the Unified Black Movement. FOR RACIAL EQUALITY But there's more to be said here. Forty years before the gathering in front of the City Opera House, in 1938, a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the end of slavery organized by remaining members of the Brazilian Black Front was also scheduled to happen in the vicinities of the Opera House. Unfortunately, the event never took place, in spite of every effort made by the head of the Municipal Department of Culture at the time, Mário de Andrade, our favorite modernist. The fact that we're here in this place that was denied to our ancestors, is thanks to the sweat and blood of people along the way. At the height of military dictatorship, there were people who were brave enough to rise up against the Brazilian state and its murderous racism and say that this country needed to acknowledge the leading role of people of color in Brazilian society. Some of the people here today were also at the front steps of the Opera House in 1978, fighting racism. This is a magical time for me because you are here. Because our presence here is a historical achievement. I'd like to ask them to stand up now… Our brothers and sisters from MMU. On these front steps, from here in São Paulo to all of Brazil, the Unified Black Movement will continue its fight. Thank you so much. Without your dreams, without your struggle, none of this would be possible. I dedicate to them this next song. My Luanda skin Aruanda lobby Like T'challa, Wakanda Black mamba poison A bunch of bandoliers What are the rules here? Tonight ya gonna see more blood Than in Hotel Rwanda This era started wild Panther on the loose Shows its claws I brought the night as camouflage I'm an avenger, avenging the pain Of those smashed by the gears While you are coup, I am Sabotage Mystic A thousand orishas in a pantheon Brave, I kill settlers Bringing them to an end, like a Tsavo lion I go deep, indeed Never hold me back, it's worse Monster, skull, Vibranium I chop you up in 12 pieces A flash like Usain Bolt 10,000 volts Applause from my ancestors, listen Ta-Nehisi with no coaches Memory is long, temper is short In this approach and so Rumor has it that I've come back like an AK With determination Sensibility and chill, bro If things get rough We better get back -Like a Black panther -I am back Like a Black panther With determination Sensibility and chill, bro If things get rough We better get back -Like a Black panther -I am back Like a Black panther Now on my roof, she's Dora Milaje Sprouts on the base Very Nicki Minaj-y, it's a mirage Mirage Jet, flying high Mr. Spock is the bomb Green Lantern, I am very Static For a new Red Sea A new crossing For people to see kings in the mirror My pen creates Wu-Tang Street Superman, more technology Symbolic like a guide In the chilly nights I'll crush boys that mock Black culture A Kasparov toasting mate And writing checks I stand against the slave masters An indie on my own track I'm sharp, respect my timing Don't be such a brat If you come like Stan Lee, like Spike Lee Kinda Bruce Lee I am taking Brazil In a Mauricio Kubrusly kinda way Like Solange in A Seat at the Table Black or dark-skinned? When in doubt, call her princess Self-knowledge, self-help Flow of time Like samples, like Buddha Love that could fill a thousand books Like Gabo or Neruda Whoever married the storm Doesn't care about umbrellas, got it? With determination Sensibility and chill, bro If things get rough We better get back This night will be forever in our hearts. For real, man. To remind us that freedom isn't permanent. We have to always fight for it. And we'll keep on fighting for it. Like a tractor. Out of our way! With determination Sensibility and chill, bro If things get rough We better get back -Like a Black panther -I am back Like a Black panther The power of a symbol. What did them guys and girls do? They didn't know what could happen. It was a dictatorship in a country that kills Black people without batting an eye. The next day, they could all be in jail, or worse, dead. But they cut through their fear and stood on those front steps to create a powerful symbol of struggle and unity against racism. NOVEMBER 20TH NATIONAL BLACK AWARENESS DAY To the military, anti-racism was directly connected to communism. Simonal himself ended up in DOPS for his tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. With your permission, I'd like to sing this song. I dedicated it to my son… hoping that, in the future, he's never faced with the problems I faced… and sometimes still do, despite being who I am. Yes, I have dark skin My brother of the same color What I ask of you Is that you fight Yes, that you fight a little longer The battle is almost over For every Black person who is gone Another Black person will come To fight And shed blood, or maybe not A song can go a long way, my brother Listen to my voice, oh, yeah Fight for us The Blackest struggle… But a lot of things came out of that. It annoys me because it's nothing new, you know? From the moment that Africans started being abducted and dumped in a land they didn't know, they needed to rethink their model of collective organization. For example, the religious brotherhoods of the 17th century. Black people get organized, raise a little money, buy each other's freedoms, and that's how they did it. Bit by bit, they built a community for mutual welfare. Aristocrata was a club built by Black people. But it didn't discriminate like white people clubs did, which didn't allow Black people in the pool. Anyone in the premises could have a good time. So you take the religious brotherhoods, take what the Aristocrata people were doing, and where does that lead us? To our parents' generation. -Ever been here before? -First time. Damn, shit's getting real. -First time. -You've never been in here? Never, not even to take pictures. SINGER -Damn. Not even as a tourist? -No. Yeah… From now on, it's ours. I'm a dark-skinned Brazilian kid, you feel me? And we really need to keep harping on about it. So that each generation hits harder. When a Black person is called a monkey, people look at them to see their reaction, but we should ask the white person, "It's been 500 years and you're still doing that?" I'm not a target for racists. I'm their nightmare. I've cheated death Now I know where I'm heading This wasn't luck I am where I've always wanted to be I trust no one -Let alone some Po-po -Fuck the police Money in my pocket My pulse frozen Right before the show Well before the blow I was with my bros Before all the hype and envy I've cheated death Now I know where I'm heading -This wasn't luck -Okay. Endless grudges I made faith reverberate Like a cathedral Sacred like the Torah Deadly like a cobra A voracious shark for Oriental knowledge My chant made the Atlantic Into a quantum particle -Find me in every storm -Ancestral voices Courage cannot be measured In times of peace -Jesus 2.0 style -Damn, Jesus 2.0 I walk on the water of forgetful grief Away from the rules imposed upon me I was nothing Today I'm infinite Feeling like the invention of zero Not conceited, just convincing See what rhyme's done to streets From freebase to beats in folders The world can't stand us My caste flies at the speed of light Ping-pong Cut the crap, enough My rasta mind celebrates Yin and yang rebalanced Like a filmmaker, I look for the gap I outshine the party Aim for the head Throw a Kim Jong master I decide whether you're dealing With the King Or the Kong Like Aztec gold, I came from a Barren Life Everything was like Sahara, Sahara Abundance is the goal Like Mecca I am Thomas Sankara I confront and rebuild Like a newborn, wrapped in pussy A mix of Vivara, Guevara, Lebara My pen fucks with "white history" And the world shouts Don't stop, don't stop Enough of this caravel fetish Real talk, just stop Put it in perspective I go on, smash it And they call it a concept Somehow I bring the hand of Shiva This is God speaking through my bros It's me aiming and killing the Klu Only those who cheated death up North Know it wasn't luck, but the hand of Eshu I put on a suit Just to mess with them Subordinate or subversion? Everything was Hell I turned it around The goal is eternity, infinity ACT III HARVESTING You know when our moms or old ladies from the hood, when old Black ladies would tell us, "You're Black, so you gotta do ten times better to be seen as an equal"? I think this is still true, and we have to study ten times harder, because the playing field is a minefield where your life is worthless. The grief over your dead body is shorter, you know? If you ever slip up, which can happen to anyone, people will be less forgiving if you're a Black body. BRAZIL When influential artists, inspired by French Futurism, inaugurated Modernism in our neck of the woods, Black intellectuals in France made a massive contribution to the history of humankind with a five-letter word which is sometimes used as an insult and sometimes to show affection. But its main purpose is to express pride. That word is "Negro." And all the ideology that it captures in its variations. Négritude, or "Blackness." And you can write it in bold. Over here, the need to turn tragedies into power was equally urgent. One of the best examples of this dream was Abdias do Nascimento. Especially when he founded the Black People's Experimental Theater, which opened up new opportunities to strengthen Afro-Brazilian culture and values. Once, when he was abroad, Abdias attended a play where the main character was played by a white man in blackface. Right then and there, he decided to create a theater company for Black people, to fight racism. I remember the number of people who came to advise… ACTOR AND ACTIVIST …that I not do this. That I not use "Black" in the name, because that would cause the initiative to fail before it came to fruition, before it even began. In that regard, I was… absolutely adamant… that it had to be Black Theater. Black People's Theater. Actor, fine artist, poet, writer, playwright, professor and politician. He even produced plays inside the Carandiru prison with a cast of inmates. Abdias do Nascimento was all those things without ever giving up on his activism for the human rights of Black people. In his art, he paid tribute to people such as Luís Gama, an abolitionist poet and attorney. A true Futurist, who could be considered a forerunner of Négritude, many decades before that word made it to our shores. Just like Candeia and Lélia Gonzalez did with Quilombo, Abdias used art to exalt our culture, to push it beyond simple entertainment and turn it into a very powerful political tool. The Black People's Experimental Theater also introduced to the world… the high-caliber star that was Ruth de Souza. When I think about Ruth de Souza… PROFESSOR AND ACTIVIST …I realize that if her talents had been put to full use as the great actress she is, she would easily have become the greatest actress in Brazilian TV, for example, as now she's mostly on TV, but she's also done movies. Ruth de Souza was the Black first lady of Brazilian theater, the first Black actress to play a lead role in Brazilian television, the Black first lady of cinema. She got a scholarship and studied in Howard and Harvard. She was the first Brazilian actress to be nominated for a Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival. And if that's not avant-garde, I don't know what is. We didn't have any money to produce The Emperor Jones, my first play. RUTH DE SOUZA ACTRESS We didn't have the money and we didn't have a venue. And I said, without a second thought, "Let's request the Opera House." I thought it was so beautiful. We went to see the mayor and he gave us May 25… May 8, actually. The end of the war. The day the war ended. It was very moving to me. There were fireworks outside, and I'd say they were celebrating my first role. With the faith of the ones Watching the scene From the players' bench The goal we needed the most… SINGER Ball on the post "Ismália" was originally intended to team up two giants of our theater, Ruth de Souza and Fernanda Montenegro, in a duet. But sadly, Mrs. Ruth de Souza passed away while we were on tour in Europe, a few weeks before we were going to start recording. Not even our dreams Are free of obstacles… Actress Ruth de Souza was buried today in Rio de Janeiro. She was the first Black actress to perform on the stage of the Rio de Janeiro Opera House. White people's happiness is complete Black people's happiness Is a near miss… Nobody walked in the studio and said, "This is what we'll do." You feel me? It was an experimental process. I mean, Nave and I, we've been working together for some 12 years. You touched up that beat. MUSIC PRODUCER It was already great. Half my work was already done. You're being humble. Shit's got a lot more body now. The way you split it to put in the other beat. After 12 years, we finally have the technical and financial means to up and say, "Marlon's gonna play this trombone part." And it's got such a crazy vibe that suddenly Marcos Valle joins in. You know? You realize, "Holy shit, Fernanda Montenegro is here." She played Our Lady in A Dog's Will, and she's in the project. Hello. So good to see you. -How are you? -Two kisses. Mrs. Fernanda's solid performance in "Ismália" offers us solace in the face of an abyss that we're sometimes led to believe to be our fate. I love this poem. It think it's so deep, so grand. I chose to record it now because I think it speaks a lot to our times. That's true, though. This is where we find ourselves. If you've gone mad up in the tower, you're not dreaming. -It's such a honor… -For me as well, know that. Let's hope it's as beautiful in real life as it is written. Just like the text. Shithole of a country Exactly what the media likes Gave us failure And demands medals From runners with compound fractures Stabbed in the back Quartered by dues and norms But we numb ourselves and say that Someday everything will be all right That a diploma means manumission And my color's not a uniform #BlackLivesMatter, bravo But after 80 bullets You finally see the difference Between fair skin and target skin -And the shooter wore a uniform -Once more -The accusers weren't even there -Mean-spirited For a Black dead body Is like a Billboard hit single Everyone can see it But that shit won't get through I looked into the mirror Icarus faced me back Be careful Don't fly too close to the sun They can't stand your freedom Imagine seeing you as king Vultures wanna see you a junkie Just to go, "Told ya!" In the end, we're all… Ismália, Ismália Ismália, Ismália Ismália, Ismália Reaching for the sky Ended up on the ground Every Black person is Ismália, Ismália -Ismália -Ismália, Ismália -Ismália -Ismália, Ismália Reaching for the sky Ended up on the ground First, kidnap them Rob them Lie about them Deny their God, offend Separate them If one of those dreams dare to run Stop it And let them argue With the bullets that cuts through them Man, unfortunately In places where the sun feels hotter "To slay it" still means Just to fill another kid's coffin Wanted to be a star Became a medal for some jerk Who happens to carry the same color That killed their ancestors A first paycheck Two police uniforms Three Black kids in the backseat Same color as the four Racionais Five disrupted lives Gold and bronze boys Gunshots, gunshots, gunshots That little boy was shot 111 times -And the shooter wore a uniform -Ismália Those who pointed fingers Weren't even there Black people dissolution Along with the sharp vision of those Who have everything but color In a world where color matters the most "When Ismália went mad She got up the tower to dream She saw the moon in the sky Another moon in the sea In the dream where she got lost She bathed herself in moonlight She wanted to climb to heaven She wanted to go down to the sea In her own raving In the tower, she began to sing She was close to heaven She was far from the sea And as an angel, she hung With wings to fly She wanted the moon from the sky She wanted the moon from the sea The wings God gave her They fluttered wide Her soul climbed to heaven Her body went down to the sea" The artists from the hills were persecuted by all means possible. The Brazilian state quickly added to its legislation an effective means to silence the cultural wealth of our people through a legal instrument known as the Vagrancy Law, used over the years to jail samba and capoeira artists and to crack down on Candomblé and Umbanda. Back in the day, I was arrested for holding a tamborim. I wasn't even playing it. And I was arrested. Do you remember the decade? That was in '41. Back then, the police chief didn't allow instruments with tension rods. SINGER AND DRUMMER DIRECTOR He said negroes could use tension rods as weapons. REPRESSING THE VAGRANCY - Police chief recommendation to all deputies And the same Vagrancy Law was used to lock up sex workers and persecute trans persons. And the craziest part is that this law is still in effect. Magistrate protested against the police chief I'll be a vagrant I'll be a vagrant IT IS ABUSIVE TO LOCK UP UNEMPLOYED CITIZENS VAGRANCY LAW: THE FALSE NOTION OF POLICE EFFICIENCY "AMARELO" MUSIC VIDEO SHOOT Rio de Janeiro, 2019 -Favela-dwellers don't walk around. -You're in our home. Can you imagine if you set up an operation when we're out shooting a music video, and Emicida is caught in the crossfire? It'd all go to shit. You're so tall! I think that we're bringing together our causes. SINGER - SINGER What I think we're doing, man, is lifting the fog that makes us see our struggles as separate. You can't half-ass the fight for freedom. From the moment you dive into a reflection about gender, about class, and about race, there are two ways you can go about it. One's hypocritical, you only think about yourself. The other one is, "If we want this for us, we want it for everybody." -Am I in this part? -Yes. You and me. When we come together, we notice we have very similar stories and that it's ridiculous for us to be in separate movements. I wanted to double one of Emicida's lines. I think that's fierce. This one, look. He's challenging me like I'm new at this. I'm a rapper, okay? I attended an event called Creators' House. He did some shit with this song that… gave me goosebumps. He got this trans girl… SINGER …to walk in and sing, and she fucking smashed it. She went down the catwalk alone, singing these lyrics. She'd stop and look at everyone, repeating this… Last year I died! Not this year, though! That hit me real hard. I started to listen to Belchior on repeat, and said, "How did I never realize it?" Just like a prism decomposes white light into many colors, in AmarElo, I'd like to decompose prejudice into many other possibilities. This is our way of telling our brothers and sisters on the streets that they can't give up. It's using the power of love, which is something all human beings can do, to forge this link. It's as if a portal opened, and all the OGs that came before me said, "Brother, get out there." "Life only has meaning when we connect, when we get together." And the feeling of singing with Majur and Pabllo is that of the whole world gathering around us. Fela Kuti said that music is a weapon. And busting these chains of hate and resentment is just what we do when we join Belchior to sing this song. Enough bleeding, enough crying Last year I died Not this year, though Enough bleeding, enough crying Last year I died Not this year, though I'm a rare breed Shining in the dark One of a kind Straight from the hood Hooded, from the top of the hill Me and my brothers My piece in my pocket And ill-spirited Only God and I know How it feels to have nothing, to be exiled Cut the world with rhymes But thought of cutting my wrists Our lives are measured by our wealth We are worthless It wasn't a hit But a call for help this morning Man, resentment works like a tumor It poisons the roots Where the audience Only wants to be happy Everyone's heads are in the clouds Where the new trend is depression Disguised as vacation trips My grandmother used to say It's real easy to hate the devil Hard is living in hell What we realize is That the same old rotten empire That never took you seriously Also wants you to bite the dust Fight back Enough bleeding, enough crying Last year I died Not this year, though Enough bleeding, enough crying Last year I died Not this year, though Allow me to speak louder than my scars They're just accessories Shouldn't even be here Allow me to speak louder than my scars So much pain robbing us of our voices You know what's left of us? Walking targets on the streets Allow me to speak louder than my scars I wanna live, not just survive If living is just surviving I'm being robbed of my few good moments At last, allow me to speak Louder than my scars The worst crime Is to let my traumas define me Doing so, we give our enemies a trophy And silence ourselves Enough bleeding, enough crying Last year I died Not this year, though Enough bleeding, enough crying Put your hands up, City Opera! Come on! Enough bleeding, enough crying Last year I died Not this year, though Enough bleeding, enough crying Last year I died Not this year, though Last year I died Not this year, though BELIEVE IN YOUR AXÉ City Opera… Pabllo Vittar and Majur! Laboratório Fantasma is a collective dream. One that began way before we materialized in this plane of existence. Wilson das Neves once said to us, "You can snap a cigarette in half, but not a whole pack." That was his way of saying, "Stick together and you'll stay strong." Shit like that strengthens everything we stand for. SIBLING, ENTREPRENEUR AND ASSOCIATE AT LABORATÓRIO FANTASMA And, standing stronger, we can fight all them giant monsters. But there's a minor detail. A really minor one. To be exact, a microscopic detail was about to do damage of Dantean proportions. First confirmed deaths due to the novel coronavirus… Reached the mark of 10,000 deaths… In Brazil, over 60,000 deaths… This brings to light the vulnerability of workers who aren't being sent home in this moment of social distancing. Hey, man, good morning. How are you? I don't have good news. Things are getting worse here in Brazil, you hear? So I think we're gonna need a complete change of plans. I don't know yet how it's gonna be, but we've already started canceling concerts, we've gotten cancelation requests. CORONAVIRUS WASH YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY And we're not going to do Drik's European tour either. And right now it's arriving here, bro. Because the number of cases is rising fast over there. Let's see how the next couple of days pan out, but I wanted to let you know, 'cause things are tough. And that's all. See you, bro. Here's something very representative. The first victim of coronavirus in Brazil was a housekeeper. She caught the virus from her employer. That's quite symbolic. Poor people get infected more easily, and the social chasms make it impossible for the poorest, who are also more likely to be people of color, to recover from this disease. That's what feels hopeless. To the ancient Yoruba, nothing is new. Everything that's happening now has happened before. So you have a pandemic caused by a virus that's infected a massive amount of people all over the planet, spreading fear and insecurity, and locking everybody up in their homes, feeling uncertain about one another and about the future. When you think carefully about the nature of things, you are able to foresee stuff, because one way or another, nature always completes its cycles. It spins around like a record on a turntable. We've traveled so much in time, that I forgot something important that I had to say. Exactly one century ago, the world was beginning to beat the Spanish flu pandemic, and a movie theater decided to hire eight musicians to play in the lobby, to get past people's fears and get them to come inside. These eight musicians were our own Oito Batutas, who would later take the world by storm. Isn't it magical to think that in a moment like that, samba was the assuager of despair, the ambassador of gatherings, smiles, and hugs? And that's why I love the saying, "With the stone he threw today, Eshu killed a bird yesterday." Every single chance we have to fix the disconnects of the past resides in the present. And that, my friend, is why it's all for yesterday. All, all, all All we have is each other All, all, all All we have is All, all, all All we have is each other All, all, all All we have is All, all, all All we have is each other All, all, all All we have is All, all, all All we have is each other All, all, all All we have is All, all, all All we have is each other All, all, all All we have is All, all, all All we have is each other All, all, all All we have is All, all, all All we have is each other All, all, all All we have is All, all, all All we have is each other All, all, all All we have is It marks what the 21st century is about, which is the present moment when we're giving Black women more visibility, strength and encouragement. We're testifying the blossoming today of what Mrs. Ruth de Souza planted decades ago.
