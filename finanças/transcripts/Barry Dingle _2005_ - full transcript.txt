I'm not gonna sleep with you. Hey, I'm not gonna sleep with you, either. Well, then what's with all the work? I mean, what are you, some kind of altruist or something? What's an altruist? Someone who goes around doing nice stuff just because, like Jesus or Spider-Man. Sometimes I'm an altruist, but I am definitely not an altruist now. [ sighs ] So what's... What's the deal? Well, the deal is that I think you're pretty fucking beautiful. And I think you're sweet, and I think you're kind of sad. [ Barry Dingle reads narrative card aloud ] [ doorbell chimes ] Al Shivers is running for the Senate. I assume that your Barry Dingle will begin his pursuit of the young Ethel Shivers in a romantic capacity. Hmm. Debora Childers, that's why you asked me to your home. [ chuckles ] Well, you know, I don't tip my hand, and I can barely tolerate your presence in public. Well, you can't teach a pig manners, even if she has won a blue ribbon at the town fair. What do you want? Watch your tone. Or what? Eleanor Dingle, my son Daniel will also be courting Ethel Shivers. Now, I've asked you here today to warn you that, should you try anything funny with my boy, I will make certain that every member of the board of the museum receives an e-mail, describing each disgusting detail of your conniving and hideous behavior! Well. Does 2365 Christopher Street mean anything to you? [ laughs ] Yes, Debora, it's your husband's transsexual weekend fuck palace! Now, if I were you, I would be very selective about the threats I make and to whom I make them. And I would just keep praying to God that I don't get into power, because when that day comes, I will crush you like a grape! I'm not afraid. Debora, I'd be afraid. I'd be very afraid. BARRY: [ reading narrative title ] [ dog barking ] ELEANOR: So what are your plans tonight? Go to a bar. [ gasps ] A bar? Yes! What's wrong with a bar, Mom? Oh, what is wrong with a bar? You little hooligan! I'll tell you what's wrong with a damn bar! It's full of cheap floozies! [ sighs ] Don't you think of anything other than your prick? Mom, I... Why don't you go to the Guggenheim? I'm on the board, you know. The Guggenheim on a Friday night? Why not the Guggenheim? You could ask Ethel. Oh, you could take her to dinner and then to the museum. Mom, Ethel has Down Syndrome! She's a Mongoloid! She has a large forehead. Bangs could help. It's no big deal. It's no big deal, my ass! She's got a head like Rocky Dennis! Don't say ass to your mother! Her father is running for U.S. Senate. Who cares? I care! You will do this one favor for me. Mom, Ethel wears floral linen moo-moos from Eileen Fisher! As opposed to what? Baggy jeans that are falling off the rear, a bra? What about a tongue ring? Okay! Nothing like a tongue ring to aid fellatio. Mom! I know what you want. You want someone to be taken care of. And while you're off at work, they spend their days shopping and hoarding every last penny in a filthy offshore bank account. They're just like a little squirrelly little squirrel, just lining their nests with your blood! Mom, what are you talking about? I know what I am talking about! Not to my boy will this happen. They're sluts! Sluts! Mom, your blood pressure! [ dog barking outside ] Oh, go on, huh? Just go on! Go out! Bring home a tattooed Petri dish! Make it two. BARRY: I am not...I'm not going to sleep with you. I heard you. Well, then ask me out on a date. Okay, let's go out on a date. Okay. Dinner tomorrow night. Sure. What's your number? It's, um, 917... Yeah? 555... Uh-huh. 2626. Okay. What is...What is that? Aw, shit! What? We gotta stop by my house before I take you home. No, we don't. Yes, we do! I gotta walk my puppy, Billie. Billie? This is so... This is so wrong. We'll walk my dog. It'll take 10 minutes. Mmm, mm--Ooh. Where-- Where's the dog? My mom walked him. He's sleeping upstairs. You're never gonna call me. Oh, yes, I will. You just-- You had no intention of driving me home. You saw me in the bar. You knew I was an easy target. My eyes are too expressive. They--They give me away. No, they don't. Oh, God, please-- Oh, my God, you are so wet. That's completely unintentional. Oh, I want to taste you. Oh, please. I just want to taste you. No, you don't. I want to taste you. I want to taste you. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God, okay. Stop! Stop! No. Please don't, please don't. Don't. It's just my hand. No, no, no! It's just my hand. I don't want to... No, I just... Oh, God, please. Barry, no, seriously, stop. Stop. I don't want to have sex. I don't want to have sex. Okay, okay, don't worry. It's just my hand. I don't-- No, no, seriously, stop. I'm just trying to make you feel good. I don't-- I don't want to do this! Jesus Christ, I'm almost finished! Get the fuck off me! Fucking asshole! What? You think this is funny? No. No, actually I think this is pretty fucking sad. You are such a fucking asshole. You know what? You know what? Fuck you, really, because you're the asshole. Oh, so the real Barry finally comes out. Well, nice to fucking meet you. Oh, come on, come on. Come on. Like you had no idea? No idea that I was gonna try and sleep with you? It was a big fucking surprise? You said that you wouldn't! I said that I wouldn't! But you did! You are such a son of a bitch, you know that? I was actually looking forward to going out with you, you know? I was obviously attracted to you, you idiot, and I would have slept with you like on the third date! But instead you choose to use my feelings against me! That's so... That's so fucking evil. What is wrong with your insides? Hey! Hey! There's nothing wrong with my insides, okay? I'm a mammal. This is what mammals do. I tried to sleep with you! It's instinctive! Oh! Oh, it's instinctive to pretend to be using your fingers and then to force yourself inside me? Yes, yes, and it's called the finger-cock switch! Oh, you are... You are... You are worse than the animals, you know that? Because you actually make a conscious decision to behave the way that you do. Hey, let me just say something, young lady, okay? It's not my fault that people's needs and their wants are diametrically opposed to what's good for themselves and the ones around them. [ door opens and closes ] Where's my fucking lotion? [ rooster crows ] [ clock chiming ] [ sighs ] [ groaning ] Who is it? Police! Police Department! Open the door! Who? Police! Seriously? Police Department. Open the door! Look, buddy, open the door, or I'm gonna break it down! [ loud thud ] LEVINOWSKY: Finger-cock switch? Finger- fucking-cock switch? ELEANOR: Lies. That's a hell of a tag line to just come up with off the cuff! She's a crafty little bitch. Okay, okay. How am I supposed to defend the finger-cock switch Casanova, huh? She gets up there on the stand and yells, &quot;Finger-cock switch!&quot; just how am I supposed to retort, hmm? Hey, hey! You leave him out of this, Levinowsky. You're our lawyer. Are you telling me that DWIs are all you're capable of defending? When she asked him, she asked him why he overpowered her, why he forced himself on her. You know what she said? She said he said it was instinctive. I was angry. I was frustrated. Oh, I see, of course! Your Honor, my client date-raped the victim because he was angry and frustrated! I didn't date-rape anybody, okay? We were just fooling around! 82% of males convicted of date rape said they were just fooling around! ELEANOR: I told you, she's a liar. I bet the house a civil suit is what she's really after. Well, for somebody who is lying, her story is incredibly detailed and complete. Listen to me, you goddamn Polack! Who do you think you're talking to? I was being awarded 50% in divorce court while you were still on the mock trial team at Polack High! Now, you do your goddamn job. You get him out of this, so that we can get on with our lives. That's what I am trying to do. Well, be a tad more delicate. All right, let's talk about... the bruises on her wrists. Or do you think she's lying about that too? You sick son of a bitch! That's enough, and you will cease to torment my son! I thought you were an expert at this date rape thing, but, obviously, you don't know the first thing about it! You want expertise? 85% of rapes are date rapes! 90% of mano-a-mano rapes occur in the presence of alcohol! 84% of women know their rapists! [ sound of sirens ] They should make better friends. 1% of women report their rape! Good for them. 1% of male rapists are prosecuted! That's enough! 82% of women never fully recover! I am warning you! 23.3% of rapes are committed using the threat of bodily harm! Stop it! You're frightening him! 100% of gang-raping, cock-sucking, college-attending sons of bitches consume alcohol before they rape! Aah! Okay. [ stammering ] Okay, I-- I need to apologize. I got a little carried away there for a moment. It's nothing personal. Apology accepted. Now get out. My daughter... My daughter was recently sexually assaulted at her school. Oh, my God! Get out now! Fine... but hello! I am the only person standing between your son's white virgin buttocks and Solitary Sahib's big black cock! [ dramatic music ] BARRY: Barry Dingle. MAN: I know you had this before. [ Barry grunting and crying ] I swear to God, if you bring po-po in here, I'm-a slice your ass. You understand what I'm sayin'? [ man grunting ] BARRY: Yes! Yes! I can do it! I can do it! I can do it! I can do it! I can! [ both grunting faster ] I swear to God, if you bring po-po in here, I'm-a slice you! [ grunting ] [ sobbing ] Aah! [ gasping ] [ sobbing ] Shut up! Now go clean my hut. BARRY: [reading credits ] Eleanor? Hi. How's Barry? [ cats yowling ] How's your son coping with prison life? It is just too, too terrible. The poor, poor boy. I really do hope that he makes some friends and settles down to his new habitat. I mean, after all, 3 1/2 years is a terribly long time to be by oneself in any place, let alone in a cage. I mean, really, can you imagine? Of course, this is just between the two of us. [ cats yowling ] Oh, by the way, did you hear that my son Daniel is marrying Ethel Shivers? I'm sorry that you won't be invited to the wedding. 654 people is all that we can afford to have that one night, on that fabulous night. [ engine starts ] BARRY: [ reading credits ] So, where would you like to go for dinner? [ crying ] [ sobbing ] It's all right. [ sobbing hysterically ] [ muttering incomprehensively ] Oh, please, stop this. Stop it! Here! Here's a Kleenex. Take-- Stop it! Stop it right this minute! Stop it! Put your clothes back on! [ sobbing ] We're in public! Would you stop it? Put your seatbelt on. Come on. [ sobbing ] Not--Stop it! Just stop it this minute! Do you need more Kleenex? [ crying ] Yeah! Here! Wipe your eyes! Wipe your eyes and put your clothes back on! [ engine starts ] I've missed you, son. Oh, Mom, I've been disgraced. It's all right. What goes on in prison stays in prison. No. No, I can't live with this, Mom. You can and you will. Be strong. Oh, I know something that'll make you feel better. What? Ethel Shivers is single again. Mom! Oh, and even better? Senator Albert Shivers is a strong candidate to represent his party in the next election for the Presidency of the United States. Mom, I don't care! If you wed Ethel, you would be the President's son-in-law. Do you have any idea what the perks of something like that are? No. Power, fame, money instantly. [ sighs ] Well, what happened to Ethel's husband? ELEANOR: It was a year and a half ago. We were at dinner with the newlyweds, Daniel and Ethel, and his mother, Debora Childers, and the senator, Albert Shivers and his wife... I don't know where she was. And they were just all yakking it up, and she was gloating about her new daughter-in-law and her family. She keeps flashing me these Jack Nicholson smiles. Suddenly, her precious son Daniel stands up, says he's not feeling well. I'm not feeling well. He excuses himself... Excuse me. I look down at his chair, there is a puddle of blood. He glimpses it... [ moaning ] he hits the floor, instant coma. Everybody was horrified. He never woke up. Two weeks later, he died in the hospital... rectal cancer. Oh, my God! [ Barry vomiting ] I know what you need! Some old-fashioned revenge. Nothing heals the soul better. [ vomiting ] Nobody disgraces the Dingle name and gets away with it! [ lid closes, toilet flushes ] Oh, Mom, I'm so sick! I know, honey, and Mama's gonna make you feel all better. [ bells chiming Here Come the Bride ] BARRY: BARRY: Whoo! [ laughing ] Oh, jeez. [ sighs ] Oh, you don't buy beer, you rent it. Yes, you do. You with the Shnable wedding? No, no, the Huggins. Oh. Barry Dingle. Hey, I'm Matt Huggins. Hey, okay. Oh, Huggins! So that makes you, what, the best man? [ flush ] No, I'm the groom. So what are you saying? You telling me on my wedding night that I'm doomed to failure because of an instinct that I can't control? No. What I'm saying to you is you have to fight through those moments of weakness. That's the only way to beat the little monster and to avoid the second and third wedding. Well, why didn't that work for you? You fuck up enough and you learn from your mistakes. That kind of makes sense. Yeah, I feel a little better, I guess. Good! I'm glad I could help. What are you, some kind of therapist or something? [ sigh ] I'm a partner at a mergers and acquisitions firm. Wow, that's pretty good. It's a shit fuckin' job! I spent all day looking for office space. We're opening up a branch in New York. Get outta here! No, seriously. Well, I'm a commercial real estate broker. You're kidding! DEBORA: You look so handsome. Thank you, Mother. You look just like your brother. Okay. You know, you don't have to take Ethel out if you don't want to. Yes, I know, Mother, I want to. She's the greatest sister-in-law in the world. Ex. She's an ex-sister-in-law. Yes, I meant ex-sister-in-law. You know, your brother's looking down on us from heaven. He's rooting for you and Ethel. Yes, I know that. Oh, God, I miss my son. I--I...Okay. All right, I miss him, too. Mother, you're wrinkling. You're wrinkling, okay? Oh. No touching. We said that, no touching. Sorry. Dillon! Howdy! Hello, Senator. Now, Dillon, remember I told you, call me Albert. We're family. Yes, yes--Albert. Yes. Okay. Ow. Hugging? Uh-uh, no hugging. Um, you're crushing the flowers, Albert. Um, okay. We're still hugging? Um, okay, okay. Come on in, son. Man. Yes. BARRY: Oh, my God! Aah! What's wrong, honey? Just--ugh! [ door slams ] Ohh. [ shower running ] Oh, shit. BARRY: Thank you for a lovely evening. Dillon, it was a very nice meal. I had a wonderful time. Thank you very much. It was... Was it? It was great. Thank you very much. Yes. How is Debora doing? I haven't seen her since the funeral. DILLON: Well, Mother's okay. She's playing bridge again. Oh, well, that's good news. That's good to hear. Yes, yes. Okay, well, have a good night. Oh, no, no. Let me drive you home. No! Oh, no, no. There's a cab on every corner here. Car's right here and I got this great spot. I actually don't mind walking. The night air is rather refreshing. I'll just drop you off. Okay, oh, okay. Yes. Thank you. Can't let you roam the streets alone in the middle of the night. What is... [ stammering ] What is... What is this? What--What is this? It's a dildo... mounted on the butt of a rifle. Okay? Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. What? It's for you. Have a good night. Say hi to your mom for me. No, no, no. Tell her I said hi. No, no, no, Ethel, this--this-- Oh, Debbie, that's handsome son number two. It matches. Matches both of us. [ laughs ] That's--That's interesting. BARRY: [ shower running ] I need a shower really badly. I love you. BARRY: MATT: So there are conference rooms... [ elevator bell dings ] and, uh, there's 22 individual offices. Now, this space on the floor, depending on how you arrange it, you can have a support staff of up to about 50 people. So, um, that's about it. What do you think? I think we should walk around some more. I think better that way. How was your honeymoon? It was good. What'd you do? You know, we, uh... We did some snorkeling, we laid out on the beach, did some parasailing-- all the things that vacationing couples do on vacation, you know. Nice. How about you? I, uh... I had a threesome last night. [ laughs ] What? Yeah. Oh, yeah. How'd you manage that? This not what you need to hear right now. What do you mean? Well, I mean, you just got married. You're a little shell-shocked. Let's talk about the office space. Aw, you know, I can handle it. You sure? Yeah, of course. So I'm at this titty bar... and it's late and I've had a... a few beers, and I am watching this girl on stage, this little blonde named Dakota. Oh, man. And she is... She's shaking this... and she's bending that. And by the time she's done, I have memorized every mole, every beauty mark, every tattoo on her whole entire body. After her song, she kneels down... and she, uh, offers me a lap dance. Would you like a lap dance? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And, man, this whole time, we're vibin'. Mmm... We're gigglin'. Mmm. All of a sudden, man, she drops the bomb on me. I get off in 45 minutes. You want to come to my place and have a drink? Yes, I would. Mmm. Sure as shit, man, hour later, we are at her place having a drink. So we walk into her apartment... and on the couch, there's another girl, extremely lubed, extremely friendly, just home from the bars. But there is something very, very, very peculiar about this girl. What? Well, you see, she looks just like the stripper. Her sister? Yeah, yeah, yeah, her sister Nadine. No way. So all of a sudden, they get up... and they start to take their clothes off. And then they sit on my lap... and they start to kiss me all over and lick me, and they start to work on my clothes, and one of them goes for my belt. And they get on their knees, and they start to... They start to work my knob like they haven't tasted... cock in three years. I fucked these two beautiful girls so uncontrollably and with such passion that when I came for the third time, I swear to God I thought my balls were gonna explode. Wow. Yeah. [ Dakota breathing ] [ exhales ] [ exhales ] [ sound of breathing continues ] BARRY: [ sighs ] Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, kick in already. [ sitar music ] Derek, I am not an idiot. I know what your mother is up to. I know what your mother is up to. My father is running for President. I said it. It's true. Did you know that? Did you know that? So I'm at dinner... Oh, God! Yes? Yes or no? Yes. You are admitting it to me. And I'm having dinner with you because, for fuck's sake, you're my dead husband's brother, and all you can think about is riding me like some prized pony into the White House. Don't-- Well? Well, what? What the fuck do you have to say for yourself? What do you have to say for yourself? God, my teeth are so itchy. What? They're so itchy! What is wrong with you?! Ah! Honestly! Do you know that right now, your brother is probably getting machine-gunned up the ass by-- Mother touches us. That is not for me. She touches us. That has nothing-- Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. It's lovely. Just put that down. [ panting ] Okay, that's it, that's it. This is an official-- official protest! This is wrong and you are gonna knock it off and you're gonna go home and you are gonna tell Debora that I am not a trophy, and that she needs to cut it the fuck out! Are you listening to me? [ whispering ] I just realized something. Um, what? I'm an albatross. I'm an albatross. [ tableware clanking ] Wha--Oh, my God! I'm an albatross! Albatross! [ squawking ] Check, please? Ohh. Well, Deb, that's all three. You're out of ammo. [ squawking ] [ squawking ] [ squawking ] [ spits out fish ] I'll have a Chardonnay, please? Debora Childers, please? [ sighs ] Debora, you keep your boys away from my daughter, or I'll hunt them down like runaway slaves! Slaves, Dad? Slaves. Yeah, I'm sure Yvonne, your secretary, would really appreciate that. We're not talking about Yvonne right now. Come here, baby, come on. Dad-- Give Daddy a hug. I don't-- Come on. Give Daddy a hug. That's my girl, yeah. I love you, Daddy. I love you, too. BARRY: [ pages turning ] I'm gonna take it. What? I would like to lease this space for my law firm. Great. You'll take it just like that? Just like that, on one condition. What--What's that? That you come tonight to celebrate your big sale at my house with some of my friends. Wonderful. And can I bring my wife with me? No. No wives allowed. It's ringing, it's ringing. Hello? Hello? Yeah, may I please speak to Joanna Wojohowsky? Joan-- This is she. [ stilted ] Yeah, &quot;my name is Ron Burgenstein. I am...&quot; &quot;Burgerstein,&quot; oh, my God! Burgerstein... What fucking difference does it fucking make, you fucking prick? &quot;I am one of your husband's associates. Your husband has closed a very large deal.&quot; What-- What kind of deal? She wants to know what kind of deal. He sold a 10-year lease to an international law firm. It's on the paper. Just say it. Don't take your time. Go, go! Don't look at me. Go! You're a sick fuck. He sold a 10-year-old to an international law firm. Excuse me? Are you nuts? Are you nuts? He's a broker, a real estate broker! 10-year lease to an international law firm! That's different. You should have said. Sold a 10-year lease to an international law firm. Uh-huh? &quot;The company's throwing him a surprise party &quot;to celebrate his achievement. &quot;Would you join us this evening? It's at 9 P.M. at...&quot; Okay, yeah. Be seeing you there tonight. What are you gonna be wearing? I'm gonna be... BARRY: What do you think? It's nice. It's beautiful out here. It's all for you. For me? For you. Really? Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like for all of you to raise your glasses. I would like to, uh... I would like make a toast to our new real estate broker, Matt Huggins. Matt, on behalf of Dingle, Lyveshitz &amp; Hyman, on behalf of all of our partners, associates, and support staff, and I hope that this is the beginning of a fruitful and mutually beneficial business relationship. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Cheers! Cheers. Congratulations. &quot;Dear Matt, I'm so proud of you. &quot;Congratulations. &quot;I think we sh-- &quot;I really think-- &quot;really think we should try to work this out. &quot;I hate fighting with you. &quot;I love you so much. You're my midnight-- night fireman.&quot; [ dance music playing ] So, um... I was like 8 years old, and I was at the library, and I had to take this monster crap, and, uh... and nothing would come out, not even a deer pebble. [ dance music fades to poignant piano music ] And, uh, so I just decide I'm gonna walk back to my house, and, of course, I get like halfway from the library to my house, and it hits me. I started panicking. I, like, curled up in a ball just trying to force back down this storm of poop that was gonna come out. The only thing I could do was try and get back to my house. So...so I take one step, and that was it. Oh! My butt muscles deflate, and they weren't listening to my brain anymore. And, uh, the panic was replaced by this very short-lived, but wonderful feeling of relief after I shit all over myself. Ohh! Oh, man. You know, it's funny. I realized that I never told that story to anybody before. Why are you telling me? 'Cause you're a good friend. [ dance music resumes ] What are you guys doing just sitting here? Don't you know there's a party going on? Come on, come dance with me. All right. It's time. Get in there. Mom, I don't think I can do this! What are you-- Will you stop it! Don't you tell me to stop it! This is my plan. This is my house. And for better or worse, you're the rotten fruit of my loins! So get your used ass in there and pull that trigger! Mom, Matt didn't do anything, and he's my friend. He's your what? I mean, he's my friend. He's your real estate broker, for God's sake! Look, he's just putting on this &quot;I'm your best friend&quot; routine to close the deal. Oh, wake up, Barry. Now, be a man and finish this. Hey, do me a favor. Go upstairs in the master bedroom. There's a bottle of Scotch under the bed. Bring it down to the kitchen, and we'll do a couple of shots. Thanks. Yeah. MAN: But just think about how romantic that is, just their first date alone, right? They're ice skating. They're ice skating, it's closed, just the two of them on ice. Like it's symbolic that they're on thin ice. You know, they're kind of finding something, discovering something. Hi. Sorry. Have you seen Matt Huggins? Yeah, I think he's in the back yard. But it's cute 'cause, you know, she can't skate, she's falling, he's holding her up. It's a whole metaphor. Oh. Jeez, I'm sorry. Close the door. Okay, sorry. No. Where are you going? Close the door from the inside. All right. Come in, sit down. [ ominous music ] Has anybody seen Matt? Oh. Have you-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Have you guys seen Matt? Have you seen Matt? You haven't? Matt! Matt. Have you guys seen Matt Huggins? Matt? No? Jo? No. Oh, fuck! MATT: Jo! Jo! Jo? Jo. You're fucking dead Dingle! [ slap ] [ guests gasp ] Wow, is that all you got, Huggins? You fucking animals. [ laughs ] Well, I thought so. BARRY: BARRY: Ha ha! You feeling better? Yeah. [laughs ] Hey. You will always be my little Dingle, Barry. You know that. I would tear their lungs out for you. I know, Mom. On Wednesday, we are having dinner with Clarice, Albert, and Ethel Shivers. Mom, I don't want-- Hey, we made a deal! Now, just make sure that you have that Peace Corps story straight for the senator and his family. Barry! I know, I know. Guatemala, Tekchi, I got it, Mom. Good. Oh, isn't that the Childers boy? Almost there. Just sit down. Go slow, okay? Easy, easy. Easy. Something happened to his neck. Mommy had Anna make you some nice soup. Is it chicken Noodle? Chicken Noodle, of course. Okay. I cup up the chicken for you, okay? [ sighs ] Well, time to go home. No, Mother, it's still gonna be hot. No, it's not. It's still hot. It's not hot. I don't want it. It's not hot. It's hot. You know what? You're hurting me. It's not. It's not hot. You're hurting me, Mother. Take it down. Please take it down, Mother? Debora. Oh, did you hurt your neck? Uh, yes, it got hurt. Oh, I'm so sorry. Bye, Deb. [ mouths word ] Hey, Barry. [ mouthing question ] Uh, it got hurt. Okay... Mother, you're-- you're...stop. Sorry. Are you okay? Why? Sorry, sorry, sorry. Here. I don't want it. It's hot. It's good for you. How many times do I have to-- It's good-- I don't want it! BARRY: [ dishes clanking ] [ ominous music ] SENATOR SHIVERS: Barry? Barry? Yes, sir? I say, where were you stationed? I was, um... I was stationed in Guatemala, sir. Guatemala? BARRY: Yes, sir. I been to Guatemala. Really? What were you doing in Guatemala? Bird-watching. The senator loves tropical parrots. What kind of parrots? Jenday Conures, Majestic Macaws, Black-headed Caiques. I have an extensive photo collection. Oh, we certainly do. Where in Guatemala? Um, well, I was stationed on, uh... the Rio Dulce River, which is... It's on the east side of Guatemala. It was a fishing village. Oh, it isn't that delightful, Ethel? Rio means river. What's that, sugar? He said Rio Dulce River. In Spanish, rio is river. Oh! [ laughs ] Tell me, son, you didn't spend three years in Guatemala and not know that rio means river? No, sir, I do know that. You see, unfortunately, my Spanish is very, very rusty, because in my village we mostly spoke Kekchi. It's derived from the native tongue of the Mayan Indians. Chekti? Mm-mmm. Kekchi. Tek-Tek--Tekchi. Kek-- Kekchi? Kekchi. Tek...chi. BARRY: Chi. Tekchi. [ laughs ] Well, why don't we have a little taste of that Tekchi? Give us a little taste of it. Oh, yes. Okay. Um... Takwah ch'up. Takwah ch'up. Takwah ch'up. Takwah ch'up. Takwah ch'up. What's that mean? Can I have a pineapple? Oh, well, that'll come in handy if I ever want a pineapple in Guatemala. Takwah ch'up! Hey, Mable, Takwah ch'up! Wouldn't that be great if she brought us a pineapple? [ laughter ] [ doorbell chimes ] SENATOR SHIVERS: I'll get it. Nuts! Uh, Barry taught the village children English. Oh, oh, isn't that sweet? Were they just tiny and delightful? They weren't really tiny. They were between the ages of 12 and 18, and they were mostly girls. But that is because the men and the boys would go fishing and hunting most of the day, and that left me to watch the girls. [Eleanor chuckles uneasily ] But Barry also built latrines and taught hygiene. And he was an integral part of the development of an irrigation system, which helped grow rice. And he was the sole founder of the textile training center and was responsible for the export-import establishment with the United States. Oh, well, that is impressive. I built a few sewing, embroidery, and block printing machines. And all these things ran on this tiny, little gas generator. It was no big deal, but I tell you something. Those Kekchi girls were really, really, really great students. BARRY: I had no idea what he did to you. I had no idea who he was. Please forgive me. I won't live without you. [ fire crackling ] What are your intentions with my daughter, son? [ clock chiming ] Uh, well, I wanted to take her on a proper date. Ask me. Uh, Senator Shivers, may I please take Ethel out to dinner, sir? Son, I can smell bullshit like a bloodhound smells a bitch in heat. And you two Dingles wreak of Guatemalan bullshit. However, Ethel's heart's been broken ever since the Good Lord took Daniel away from her so suddenly. And I firmly believe that the best cure for a broken heart is new love, wherever it comes from. My wife admires your mother. She likes her social graces and mixing abilities. Clarice always did give people the benefit of the doubt. I, on the other hand, shoot first and ask questions later. Anyhow, I'm gonna allow you to date my daughter, but--and this is &quot;but&quot; with a big old &quot;b&quot;-- if your intentions are less than honorable, if you slip a curse word into dinner conversation, if you in any way besmirch the Shivers name with a speck of Dingle dirt, I'll make certain that you and your mother never set foot in the eastern, southern or western parts of the continental United States again. Are we clear? Yes, sir. Isn't that a pretty fire? [ door opening ] BARRY: Thank you, Senator. SENATOR SHIVERS: You're welcome. I'm glad you came. Thank you for dinner. Dinner was lovely. Thank you. I liked it myself. Oops! Remember what I said. [ imitates gunshot ] BARRY: [ laughs ] Yeah, I will. I remember. I was just kidding. You were. Good night. Night. Good night. Good try, Deb. DEBORA: Excuse me? Does Joanna Wojohowsky live here? Yeah. Who are you? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Debora Childers. Your wife and I have something in common. We've both been violated by the Dingles. Yeah. Can you come in? Excuse me. [ door slams ] You know how important this is to me, right? Yes. I take care of you, you take care of your mother right back, yes? Yes. What time is it? 6:30. Well, I won't be back from the Bridge game before 10:00. But when I do get home, I don't want to find you here. Mom, what am I supposed to do with Ethel for four hours? I am not going to be around to wipe your ass after every shit. Figure it out yourself. Mom? [ frustrated grunt ] [ engine starts ] [ engine starts ] [ tires squeal ] Oh, my God, look! They've got redfish on the menu! I haven't seen redfish in 15 years! And here it is, the whole story. 15 years ago, there was a chef named Paul Prudhomme, who created this recipe called the blackened redfish, and it spread through the country like wildfire. And before you know it, they got fished out, and it was illegal to commercially fish redfish. that imports these fish here and, bang, it's on the menu. Let's try the redfish. Listen up, Dingle. I'm not buying any of your Kekchi bullshit. I know for a fact you've never seen Guatemala on the Discovery Channel, let alone spent three years in a fishing village there. Peace Corps, my ass! And you and your mother are up to something. I don't know what yet...yet. Truce, please? Why are we even at dinner? I saw the way you were looking at me the other night. How was I looking at you? I found you attractive. I was looking at you. Shoot me. You were staring at my large forehead! I happen to think that you have a very aristocratic and regal forehead, and I think it's lovely. Oh! Oh, good, good. So when the kids used to call me pumpkinhead, I guess what they meant to say was, &quot;She's an aristocrat.&quot; You know, Ethel, if you just gave me a chance, maybe if you gave me the benefit of the doubt like your mother, maybe you would realize that I'm a pretty good guy and that my aim is true with you. My mother is a wet mop, and the second part of that sentence is from a song called &quot;Alison&quot; written by Elvis Costello. What? ♪ My aim is true ♪ I didn't know that. Oh, bullshit. You are such a liar. Listen, I know that you know that my husband is dead, but what you don't know is that I have never once lost self-respect, not once. So don't try your bullshit pickup routine with me, Dingle! What bullshit pickup routine have I... Wait, wait, wait. Did you-- Did you just curse at me? No, I repeated what you said, &quot;bullshit routine...&quot; Did you just curse at me again? Did you not hear what my father said to you? Ethel, why are you doing this to me? Why am I doing... Wait, Barry. Are you scared of my daddy? No! No, I am not scared of your dad. Why are you acting this way? I don't like you, Dingle. I don't like the Dingle stench that I feel coming off you, and stop saying my name. It sounds dirty coming out of your mouth. Can we at least order the redfish just for an appetizer? Oh, you are an imbecile! [ sighs ] All right, listen, I've got somewhere else to go. I am not gonna tell my father that you cursed at me at the dinner table. And you will tell your mother that you had a lovely dinner with Ethel Shivers. Hi, sweetie. You look gorgeous. Thanks. Hey, man. [ rifling objects ] Nuts! Yes! Pick up, pick up, pick up. [ cell phone vibrating ] Hello? Barry Dingle is on the premises. Shit. Hello! Pick up, pick up. [ cell phone vibrating ] Mom? Hello, Mom? [ stomach gurgling ] [ groans ] Ohh! [ groaning ] [ door closes ] [ Barry defecating and groaning ] [ groaning and defecating ] Who's out there?! [ fart ] [ farting and defecating ] Ohh! Tsk. Mom! Mom, is that you?! [ breathing quickly ] Debora! Ooh! Go! What are you doing home? My God. [ scoffs ] I told the prosecutor about this book, but I had no idea how bad it was. There's gotta be 200 women in here with check marks by their names. I mean, this guy's a... He's a serial rapist. Do you have any idea how many women this fucker has soiled? This is like a log. This is--This is like a trophy book of all the people that he's fucking scarred for life! That cock-sucking motherfucker! Joanna, just calm down. Let's call the police, okay? You believe I'm the first person who brought charges against this guy? I mean, his lawyer made it perfectly clear that he'd never been arrested before this &quot;alleged&quot; incident. You know, and he was an upstanding citizen of the community. You alone sent him away for three years. Now, there are lots of victims in this book. What are you doing? I'm calling the police. Give me the phone. Why? Just give me the phone. So, we're sitting at the bar. My girlfriend goes to the bathroom. Out of nowhere, he sashays over like a plaid-pantsed line dancer. For the life of me, I don't remember what he opened with. He goes in for the kill with a line about walking his puppy. Hey, let's go back to my house. We'll walk my puppy, Billie, and then I'll take you home. I'm dumb, but not that dumb. So he pulls the dog routine, and then I say something like, look, I'm not going home with you no matter what you say. And he believed me. Hey, hey, hey! I believe you. Because he never mentioned it again. Not another word about it. So how did he get you to go home with him? All of a sudden, my head gets a little cloudy, like I start to lose track of his words, and then entire sentences, until I don't know what the hell he's talking about. So I decide to leave, but I can't get off the chair. Luckily for me, he offers to walk me to my car. I will walk you to your car. I remember that walk over and the feeling of this overwhelming sensation of warmth enveloping my entire body. That was my last memory of that night. Warmth, like a muggy August afternoon, only it was mid-October. He put a roofie in your drink. A roofie? Rohypnol. It's a medical sedative that sexual predators use to sedate their prey. It's also called the date rape drug. Oh, my goodness! Yep. I woke up the next morning confused and pregnant. Oh, I knew it was his, because I was single at the time. Plus, I was a virgin, there was that. Oh, no. No. I quietly had an abortion and cried myself to sleep for a good three years. It's fucking awful. You poor, sweet thing. So, how far are you willing to go? Pretty far. [ rifling drawer ] Mom, have you seen my little black book?! Barry, get down here! What?! I said get down here! I want to talk to you! [ frustrated growl ] Mom, I'm--I'm-- What? Sit down. Why? I said sit down! Son, I love you. You know that. Mom, what are you, drunk? Shut up and listen. Son, I love you. I have spent my entire life trying to mold you into a successful and self-sufficient man. I have failed tragically. Unfortunately, you were born without any of my desire for success, status, or self-respect. Anyway, you're 35 years old, and I have decided it's time to relieve you of any and all of my expectations, demands, or sacrifices. Why? I have spent my entire life dreaming of sipping tea from Eleanor Roosevelt's china. And by the grace of God, that opportunity has arrived. So for finding your hand in Cousin Martha's underdoos at my birthday party, thank you very much. For setting fire to Walter Beeman's curly red Afro at camp, for being the only child at any social function without a drop of fucking rhythm, for having sex with a cot on our trip to France, for making soup with your mother's tampons and serving it to your eighth grade... Mom! For all of those times, you will do one last sacrifice. You will court and wed Ethel Shivers. Mom, Ethel Shivers is a lesbian! I don't care! If you can woo every jaded trollop and bring them back and fuck them in my living room on a nightly basis, you can certainly win the affection of one naive and homely senator's daughter. Besides, I really don't think she's a lesbo. I think that her heterosexuality has just been knocked out of her. So nurse her back to our team. If you can't and won't make this one last sacrifice for me, all of your belongings, just like your father's, will be out on the street. Now, I have to go to a board meeting at the Guggenheim with Ethel's mother, after which I am bringing the Shivers back here for tea and dessert. So I suggest you stay here and wait to charm the fuck out of Ethel, her mother, and the President-to-be. Have I made myself clear? Yeah. Good. BARRY: [ music playing in bar ] [ harp flourish ] Barbara Lementovich? Roofie in the Bay Breeze. Uh, Scotch on the rocks, please? [ coughs ] Barry Dingle. That's me. I thought it was. Don't you recognize me? Nope. I can't believe you don't remember me. We met here at this bar. I'm sorry, I--I don't remember. I have very fond memories of you, Dingle. You changed my life the night we met. You seem preoccupied. Tell you what, if you're interested in having a drink with me and my girlfriend, we'll be waiting for you at that next table. You don't buy that stuff. You rent it. Okay, okay. I get it. Okay, I get it. I'm gonna kill you, Barry. I knew it. I knew I was in trouble when I saw your wife out there, but I figured I'd slip in here, get my coat on, and get out before having to drink that fucking drink with the roofie. What are you talking about, bro? I haven't seen my wife since the night of your party that you threw for me. Matt, she's parked outside in a car. All right, sure. Whatever--Whatever, buddy. Oh, and I suppose you have no idea that Barbara Lementovich is sitting right there smiling at us. This is not gonna work for you, bro! It's not gonna work. What is wrong with you, man? You look like a fucking derelict! Are you insane? Are you all right? Oh, are you worried about me? Yes! You're worried about me? Okay, no, I'm great. I'm just awesome. You know, in fact, I haven't eaten for about a week, I haven't slept for a couple of weeks, my wife won't talk to me anymore, and I just got fired. I lost my job because of the paperwork that I submitted on your firm. But, otherwise, oh, I'm great! Any other worries you have? Any other concerns? I did this to you? You sure did, buddy! And now I'm gonna kill you! [ gun cocks ] Hey. I don't want to worry any of these nice people, so we're gonna go to the bathroom. Hey, hey, hey! Get up, get up! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Matt. I'm sorry. Sure you are, buddy! sure you are! Hey, hey, hey! Do you remember you told me that story about the library and then you said to me--you said, 'cause I was a really good friend. You remember that? I fucked up! I fucked up! I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry. I don't know. I assume it has something to do with your mother, but to be honest with you, I don't really give a fuck! Hey, hey, I know how to fix this thing. I know how to fix this. It's too late for you! [ crying ] I'm not talking about me. I'm not talking about me. [ thud ] I didn't lose every fight in prison, buddy. How did I change your life? Where's your friend? He's, uh... He's in the bathroom. He had really bad Mexican food. How did I change your life? I thought you didn't remember me. I thought you couldn't care less. You've...You've peaked my interest. How did I change your life? Where's your drink? Have a seat. Toast. Mmm. Here's to... Eleanor Rosemary Dingle, may she rest in peace. Cheers. Okay, now how did I change your life? Eleanor Dingle? Never mind who this is. I thought you might like to know what your scheming son is up to. [ slurring ] I remember... I remember your name... Mmm... as Barbara Lementovich. I...I put a-- [ laughs ] I put a roofie in your drink, and then I fucked you. I'm sorry. No, you raped me, you fuck! And now you're gonna take a walk. Hey, hey! Hey. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. [ gun clicking ] Where's the bullets? You don't think I have more bullets in the car? We're gonna fly. But I don't understand why you can't... What are you doing here? Are you-- What? Are you following me? No, I came to get him. Why? I don't know. What is that in your hand? Matt, were you gonna kill him? Honey, I love you so much. [ footsteps ] What are you doing here? What have you done to him? Hey! ELEANOR: What's your problem? Don't you...get away! Bitch! I got it! I got it! Ooh! Oh! Oh! [ doorbell chimes ] [ knock on door ] [ doorbell chimes ] [ knock on door ] [ pounding on door ] [ door opens ] CLARICE: Eleanor? Eleanor? Uh, Barry? Is anybody home? Mmm, nice bubblies. Eww! Oh, my! Oh! Oh, well... Oh! Panty trail! [ laughing ] Ethel! Where you going? Ethel! Do you think we should... Stop right there! Let Daddy go. Well, wait for me! [ gasps ] Oh! [ bell tolling ] Jesus Christ on a crutch! Ohh! Holy shit! [ Requiem-like organ music ] I fucking knew it! [ Clarice gasps ] Oh, honey, now, don't-- You Dingles are done. Oh, shit! Come on, honey. Come on. Shit! Shit! Shit! Don't look. ELEANOR: Shit! Wake up! Wake up! Get up! Ohh! What is going on? Good God Almighty! [ crying ] Shit! [ sighs ] Just...
