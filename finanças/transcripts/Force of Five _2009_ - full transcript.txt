Power Kids Good. Turn left, turn left. Turn right quickly, quickly. Okay. You call this half-hearted fighting Thai boxing? Kick harder! Shove out hard with your whole body. - Teacher? - Do it again. Harder! - Teacher. - This isn't Thai boxing! - Please, Teacher. - Stronger! - Teacher...? - l said, stronger! Teacher! - With all your force. - Teacher! What the hell do you want from me? My dad sent me 1 ,000 baht. How come l got only 500 baht? Because otherwise you'd use it all up. So just take this first. Okay. How does my dad look? Handsome? He worked with Michael Jackson. That's why his dance moves are similar to Jackson's. Let me have a look. l bet your mom never cheated on him. Look at you. You do have his face-- same exact rectangular shape just like his. Don't you get it? Your dad's not only a famous country singer, he's also a popular comedian. He did every kind ofjob with every band, every show, put all the others out of work. l wonder what he'd think if he knew about this. He planned to send you to study abroad. l still wonder why you ended up here with me. What a terrible thing to say! Hey, how about that? What a powerful kick from a girl! Wow! ls this your car? Cool! Yeah, the latest model with a camera attached. lt takes a sharp, clear picture. Cat, look at this. lt's what l'd like to have. Let me see. What about this one? Can l play with it? Sure. lt's been souped-up already. lt moves like it's flying especially when it's drifting. Cool, huh? Stop bragging. lf you'd kept practicing boxing like you said you would, you'd have been a champion now. - You asshole! - Woot... come have a look at Jib's car. lt's cool. You like it? No, l like another model. Don't you remember? Yes, l do. Cat, l'd like to eat that. Won't you buy me one? This one. - lt's 20 baht. - 10 baht, all right ? - No, or l'll lose money. - Can you take any other one? - Yes. - Do you have other cheaper ones? Yes. This one's 15 baht. How about 8 baht? Why not take this one, 5 baht only? What is it? A fucking water lizard! - Sir. - Son of a bitch! lt's locked. lt's my regular way in. Where the hell's the ladder gone? Where is it? l used it yesterday. lf only l knew who moved it, l'd-- l did. - Teacher! - Teacher! Uncle! Richard. Teacher! You--! - That's all right, Cat. - Oh, Uncle! Hey, Cat! Didn't you learn your lesson yesterday? Oh, Teacher. lt's my fault. l wanted to go out yesterday. They did tell me not to, but l didn't listen to them. l'll tell you what. l don't want to whip you like l did your brother, because you wouldn't survive it. Stop crying. Look what you've done. Think. Do you want your little brother to die young? l'm sorry. Say that to your parents' spirits at the temple. Hey, hey. Woon, can't you stay still? l've got both good and bad news. Whatever it is, just say it. Whatever will be, will be. l can take it. Woon's cardiovascular system has been getting worse. His heart muscle is working at less than 30% efficiency. We can't let it go lower than this. We'll have to examine the details and give him stimulants and more diuretic medication to reduce the water in his lungs. This is what we must do until his operation. Take it easy. Here's the good news. The Siam General Hospital in Ratchaburi called this morning. There's a 12-year-old patient with a head injury. He's been in a coma for months. The doctor now confirms that the patient is brain dead and l found that his blood type matches Woon's. We'll just have to wait for the decision of his relatives. lt sounds like good news, but it's still bad, because someone has to die anyway. But... Are you gonna sit and wait for the car to pop out? Hey, Pong, can you lend me the money your father sent you? You sure you want the car? lt's really expensive. l'll empty my pockets for it. What? You've only got 100 baht left afterjust a day? There's lots of stuff people need to use money for. - What about your own money? - l have almost 200 baht. l don't think it's enough. Don't worry. l'll go ask Teacher. Stealing his money? l'm getting the money for Woot to buy Woon's present. l stole only 100 baht. Anyway, it's mine. Only 100 baht? Do you think it's enough? You really got it from Teacher? Excuse me. - Yes? - Which one is Teacher Lek? l came to study Thai boxing. Sorry, l don't know. l'm a tourist. - You are? - l'm sorry. Where's Teacher Lek? l came to study Thai boxing. Put on the headband and go like this... "ls Teacher Lek in? l'm here to study Muay Thai with him." Oh... l've got it. l've found a way to make more money. This is my friend here. He will show you about Muay Thai... Go, go, kick, kick. He'll kick quick. Cool. Kick, kick, kick. Again, again. Power good, power good. Stay away from him. Muay Thai! Woot, remember what Uncle taught us? Don't use a stick to lever a log. Use these. - He's coming! - Hey, Pong! Muay Thai. Cool! Go. l don't teach Thai boxing for you to bully others. lt's meant for unity and self-defense! Go! You think you're so good at it now, before long you'll use it to rob or kill someone? ls that what you intend to do? Wait. Stand still. You'll all get a whipping from me! And what's this got to do with you? Well... Oh, pardon me! Teacher Lek, Teacher Lek! You assholes. No wonder you could bear the pain. You let me get hurt alone. Ow! Silly you! Don't you start! - Cat, Cat, help! - Easy, easy. - Teacher, Pong's bullying me. - Don't, don't! Hey, you, easy. Why do you keep bullying him? You know he's not well. Haven't you just made enough trouble? Don't you know he has a heart problem? Wanna start again? Now l'll have to spank you so you won't do it again. - Yes, it's my fault. - Your fault? Right? Yes sir, it is. Since you've got a sore behind, l'll whip your legs instead. - Oh, no, please! - Remember! Don't ever bully Woon again! Please, no, no. 2500 baht. Wow! Expensive. You're inflating the price. You've got a big mouth! Don't listen to him. Can you make it a bit lower? 2200 baht. That's the cheapest l can go. The car's got very few options. Won't you lower it a bit more? No more discounts! You blew it again. Why do you always do that? What're we gonna do? We've got only 1600 baht. l don't know. Think. You jerk! Woot, here's the car Woon wants. Oh! You're such an angel. You're perfect. You think l didn't see that? You're not so cool after all. Thanks, Jib. Hey, Jib! l didn't know you were hanging out with these street boxers now. No, l just ran into them. Just being around them is bad luck. You'd better take a bath to wash off the jinx. That's a lousy thing to say! Why? You got a problem? Jack, do you have a race tomorrow? Yes, l have a race tomorrow. You get your car ready to race too. Come on, Woot, Pong. Let's go home. Don't you follow us, two-face! What're you waiting for? Wanna come? l'm going. ls this your new car? lt's the same model l like. Can l play with it? You don't have to ask. lt's yours. lt's my car? My car! Where's my money gone? Cool. Just like a pro. Really? Can we show it off? - You can even get it into the race. - Really? Here, come on, come on. Thank you. - Don't thank me. lt's Woon's. - Little brother's stuff is also mine. - lt is not. - lt is. How could you say that? Finish it up and don't let him go to bed late. Yes, sir. Why don't you take Woon with you tomorrow to race with your leader at the track? l don't think it's a good idea. Better leave them alone. Racing? Can l go with you, Jib? You'd better not. Believe me. Yeah. You're still not very well. But l'd really love to go. Teacher said l'll have to go in the hospital soon. l don't know when l'll be back to play again. Please let me go with you. Please, Woot. Please let me go with you. Please let me go with you. Watch me. l'm gonna win the first prize for you all. No bragging please. What time does the race start? - Race? What race? - The car racing. - Who's gonna join? What model? - l will. You, little one? Let's have a look at your car. Show him the car. You think this is a race track for idiots? l told you not to come. He just wants to try it, that's all. You don't have to be mean to him. Yeah. You shouldn't. See, l modified the engine for him. - Oh, yeah? - Woon, let's just sit and watch, okay? Please, let me join the race. After all, l've managed to sneak away from Teacher. Better take him home. lt's annoying. lt's okay. Let him race. l'll handle him myself. Just make sure you don't cry on the track. l don't want to watch this. l'm getting a drink. Come on, Woon. Quick. - Faster, faster. - Faster, Woon. - My car! - Woon! - No, don't go down there, Woon. - My car! Woon, don't. What's happening? - You're dead. - Hey, Woon. Woon. - Woon! - Follow him. - Woon, go! - Where? Woon, run. Go. Run, run! Please let him go. Mind your own business. Here comes the hero to save the day! Come on, quick. Sorry. Woon! Woon! Woon! Hurry up. Help! Please help my brother! Woon? Wake up, Woon. Come on. Come around! Wake up, Woon. l'm sorry. You can't go in there. - Woon? - You can't. Teacher... l couldn't catch up. And he lost his way... then he just collapsed. l couldn't help him. l've got good news. Mr. Mawin Boonrubsub The US Ambassador, Mr. Peter, has confirmed his heart examination today at 10:00 a.m. Down! Get out, quick! Go quick. Come on, quick! Go. Sit! We, the minority group, Teelor, have been asking for sympathy from the Thai Government to let us stay. But they've turned a deaf ear to our plea. Now it's time that we made our presence felt. As of now, there's still no specific demand from the terrorists... Just now there's a report of an unknown number of terrorists... You cheated. - Come on. Don't mess around. - l didn't. No, start again. - l won. - No, you didn't. - Don't cheat. Restart. - Okay, okay. Don't you cheat... - That time, l barely beat you. - So what? Don't be noisy in the hospital. Will you listen? - Have you heard the news? - What news? ...have seized siam General Hospital with Mr. Peter Anna, the US Ambassador, being held hostage with others in the hospital. Uncle, isn't that...? What about the heart that's supposed to be coming? We've now coordinated with the hospital's staff. Time is the most important factor here. Once the heart has been removed, it's viable for transplanting for only four hours. - After that, it'll be useless. - Four hours? l'm not sure how soon they can settle the incident. All the roads to the siam General Hospital have been closed. At this moment, there is still no negotiation from the terrorists. We will report back when there are further developments. Woot, wait. Pong, what happened? l'm gonna-- - You're gonna what? - l'm gonna-- lt's all because of you in the first place! Woot, wait! Wait for me! Hurry up, Ood. You're driving too damn slow. You wouldn't make it without me. Don't forget. We're going to Ratchaburi. Hurry up. When are we gonna get there? The car is old. This is the fastest it runs. Don't argue. Petchaburi to Ratchaburi 9 kilometers Sir, they want the news reporters. Stop! You're not coming. We don't need you anymore. - Sorry. - Excuse me. l don't think we can get in with such a huge crowd of people. Believe me. Where are they going? No, it's nothing. Everything's fine. There's nothing to see. Hey, wait for me. ln the name of Teelor's military, we demand equality and human rights for all. No matter a person's color, race or ethnicity... we want justice. Enough! Get them out. Go, go out now! Go, go! What're we gonna do? We've less than four hours left. Trust me. l've seen lots of foreign movies. Whenever they go through the pipes, they get right to the destination. lt's dirty and it stinks. Pong, you can take the bag off now. Which way are we going? l think it's this way. You don't trust me? l took the trouble to bring you here. Why are you taking the other route? lt's so stinky here. Shouldn't have come this way. l think it's this way. Why doesn't anybody listen to me? - Damn! - Come on! Come out. Go quick. Quick! Move, move! Let's have a cigar. - How is it? - Good. l can't take it anymore. Jet Li's allergic to cigarette smoke. l'm outta here. You bastard, don't ever let me catch you, or... Why don't you go check that room? l'll check this room. How could they escape? Look at that, look at that! Come on, quick. Will they be all right? Hey, quick. Come on, Pong. Grab the rope. Didn't you care to ask me first if l wanted to go or not? Hey, stop! Stop! - Hey, wait for me! - What? What robbers? Stop. Hold it! They're close behind-- l surrender! Shut up. Jib, how did you get in here? - l'm gone. - Hey, wait for me! - Oh, my God! - Shut up, Pong. How can l? Turn around and see for yourself. Where are you going? Don't. Death is part of life. Buru... l only want one thing. Let me be the last. Promise? Buru... Don't! l'm not one of the bad guys. Where are you going? Don't go out. lt's very dangerous. We know the way out. We'll get you out with us. l've got my friends with me. You wait here and we'll come back for you. l promise. Excuse me... where can l find the doctor who's in charge of Woon? Yes, let me check for you. He's been away for a long while. Could you page him for me? Yes. We've got a video from an onlooker. lt's very interesting. Let's have a look. lt seems some people are trying to escape. Let's watch again. What the hell has happened? Why couldn't you handle them? They're just kids! - Go get rid of them now! - Catch them alive. What? We don't want things to get worse with whoever they are. We came only to ask for what we deserve. You should use the word "demand" instead, Buru. Do as l say. What the hell are you scared of? l think that's enough. Let's stop. l can't stand a minute more in this room. What kind of kids do you think would come to hide here? l'd better run now. That was spooky! Cat, come here. Trust me. l'm here. Don't be scared. - l've got friends, really. - You're mumbling again. What the hell are you talking about? Doctor, wake up. l'll handle him myself. What? Doctor, l'm sorry. l am too, Doctor. l didn't mean it. Didn't mean it? Okay... how come you didn't mean it when you shoved your foot right on his face? Did you find the place where they keep the heart? Where is it? Are you sure it's this way? l'm sure it's the right way because it's the only way in the hospital. You're not making a wild guess? The organ storage room. Go quick. Where can it be? There are boxes all over. Yeah. There. Move back and look again. The words are upside down. l can't read them. Wait. Let me. - You're real dumb. - Wait. Look at this. lt has Woon's name. lt must be the heart for him. You sure? Open the door. Open it. Hey! Hey, hold it! - l'm out. - Quick, quick. No! Don't move! Go get them! Jib! Jib, help! Pong, grab hold of the rope. l'm pulling now. Are you okay? Are you trying to kill me? l'm dying. Now l'm not. - Hold on tight to the rope. - What for, Jib? Hey, that hurts! l don't know if l should thank you for that or not! How about thanking me instead? Quick, film it. Shoot it. Move! Move quicker! l'm now in front of the pre-op ward where Mr. Mawin Boonrubsub, the younger brother of Mr. Nuntawut Boonrubsub, will undergo an operation. Nuntawut sneaked into Siam General Hospital in Ratchaburi. And this is what the younger brother has to say to his brave elder brother. Woot... l know you're the best brother in the world. But l just want you to come back. l don't want the heart anymore. Without you, l want nothing, nothing at all. Woot, please come back to me. l don't want the heart anymore. Without you, l want nothing, nothing at all. So, we all know now who these kids are and why they are there at the hospital. They are very brave kids. We pray that they are safe and can leave the hospital with the heart they want. Move, quick! Put it out with water! You damn kids have ruined our plan and complicated matters. You've made the Ambassador less important! - No! - Woot, don't! Things should be easier now. Woot, there must be another heart. Yes... there is another heart. Doctor? Doctor? Doctor, please help. Can your brother... use a girl's heart? l'll give him mine. We need to operate on her now to get her heart. At last, the ordeal at siam General Hospital has ended thanks to the military force who charged in very effectively. The Thai military force... ...have successfully gained control... Captain Jeerapong Kraipol was injured while disguised as a doctor in the hospital. As for the children who sneaked into the hospital to get a heart, they are all safe and are on their way to give the heart to their brother at another hospital. Exams are approaching, and you all have a lot of homework to do. Why didn't you come home right after school and practice as usual? l wonder who started the idea. Don't put the blame on your little brother! You all are older. You can't just spoil your little brother this way. Don't you know that's wrong? Jib... you know you've made mistakes. Go wait there. Pong, l'll spare you punishment for your father's sake. Cat, boxing is for self-defense and unity, not bullying. Understand? Woot, l told you to learn it for unity. Who else hasn't gotten a whipping? Come on. - Not too hard, please. - Oh, no. l won't do that. One more. Another one because we're close, all right? Woon, you're the cause of all the trouble. Why do l have to get a whipping? Because you're the instigator of all this mess! l won't pardon you whatsoever. Turn around. l don't want to do this, but this will set an example for your elders.
