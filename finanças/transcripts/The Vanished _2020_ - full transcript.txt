Except fish sticks, she'll eat those, but, uh, we gotta tell her they're chicken nuggets. Oh, master of deception. When I have kids, I don't wanna ever lie. There's no Santa Claus, no Easter bunny, no tooth fairy. I mean, why start off life being lied to? It's hard enough. I don't know, it's... I'm Miranda. I'm Paul. Been here long, Miranda? Since yesterday. Beautiful... here. Lovely. Lovely lake. Yep, that's our bad boy next door. It's a rental. Oh, nice, yeah, you staying for Thanksgiving or...? We might. It's so peaceful and quiet here. That's what I hear. Well, if we catch anything, you're welcome to come over for dinner. Sure. As long as my husband's invited. Oh, my wife wouldn't have it any other way. Nice to meet you. You too. How was it? Expensive, 68 bucks a night! - They don't even have cable. - Jesus. Remember when we used to camp out with 15 bucks? No. I don't. Oh, yeah, worms are up too. Jesus, expensive little fuckers. And I thought the three of us could make s'mores tonight. I love you. Aw, I love you s'mores. Mrs. Corn-Corny corn Paul came to town. Oh, this is gonna be good. Taylor is gonna love it here. There's a swing set! Yeah, look at that. And look, there's even got some motorboats out here. Oh, I don't know if that's a good idea. You remember that dinner cruise we took on that boat? - Oh, God. - You know, she projectile vomited all over that one. Oh, God, I'd forgotten all about that, Jesus Christ. That woman's face! Oh! Christ, that was like something out of The Exorcist. It was. That woman's face. Oh, shit. - Hey, Lucky. No, no, no. - Hey, Lucky! - What the hell are you doing out? - No, no, no, honey. You can't. Honey, Taylor, you can't leave Lucky outside, babe! He's gotta be on the leash!

How long do you think you're gonna be? I think we're gonna be maybe an hour, something like that. - Yeah. - You know. Come on, Tay! Taylor! I hope she didn't get locked in the bathroom again. Hey, Taylor! Taylor, honey! - She's not in there. - Huh? - Paul. - What? She's not in there. Wendy... she has to be. Taylor! She's not. - Taylor! - No, no, hey, hey, hey. I'll find her. Hey, Taylor! Taylor! What? Hey! - She's... - Paul, she's not in there. Did she come out when I went up to the office? I don't know. I mean I was on the other side of the RV, I... - Taylor! - I didn't hear her come out. Taylor! She's probably just hiding, right? - Oh, hiding, huh? - She couldn't have gone far. If she's hiding, she's gonna be in big trouble. Here, here, the outhouse. Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Paul? Where is she? She's... She's gotta be... here somewhere. - Where could she go? - Taylor! - Check... - Taylor! She's gotta be close by. Taylor! Taylor! Hey, Tay! Taylor, come out! Taylor! Taylor! - We got a little girl... - They already filled me in before on the ride over. Let's go the south and west end of the lake. They're ringing on the phone for Franklin County, - see if we get a helicopter. - Done. Any word on that runner? Found his blood in the woods a few miles from the prison. - Suspect he's wounded. - Good, slow him down. All right, anything else? FBI called about the convict. Told him about the girl, he asked if we needed help. Yeah, well you tell him I got it covered. - Parents? - Yep. Not a word to them about the prisoner till we get any updates, all right? They already know. Well, shit. Mr. Michaelson, Mrs. Michaelson, Sheriff Baker. I'm gonna be running the investigation. Do you think the prisoner had anything to do with this? Well, I can see why you'd be concerned, but the last thing that a runner that's been shot is gonna want is to pick up a kid and slow him down. He was shot? Yeah. I promise, I'll always be as transparent and as honest as I can be. You got a partner here. We'll get through this. We'll find her, together. Yeah. Mind if I sit down? Yeah, sure. I know it's hard, but if you can try to remember. Now I know Mrs. Michaelson was at the store, and Mr. Michaelson, I heard you were on the other side, hooking up the RV, is that right? - Yeah. - You remember hearing anything? No. A door maybe, footsteps? - Nothing. - A voice, cries? I was on the other side of the RV, I'm hooking it up, I get my fishing poles, turn around, I see another camper. And that would be Miss Miranda Hudson. - I guess, yeah. - She gave us a statement. She said her and her husband are traveling across country for a couple weeks. Well, I didn't see him, I mean, did he see anything? He said he was in his RV watching TV. What about anybody else? Did anybody else see anything? We don't get many visits up here in the winter. It's a bit a ways, as you can see. Other than Mr. And Mrs. Hudson and the owner, Tom Henry, and groundskeeper named Justin Knowles. He was there. He was right there, I seen him. He drove by right here on his Gator, thing. He was, shit, it was just right after the disappearance. I mean, do... Well, we questioned both, and Tom says the last time he saw was when you pulled in. They could have lied. We don't know them. Look, there is no evidence of foul play here. All right. That being said, I've asked that no one leave until we further investigate. Now Mr. Henry and Mr. Knowles, they live on the property, that's not a problem. But I have no legal right to detain the Hudsons without cause. No, of course not. But they have offered to stay a while. Help with your daughter. The only advice I can give you is stay as calm as you can. Most of the time these kids just wander away. How long do you think she's gonna survive in the woods having just wandered off? We're bringing in a mobile unit. We're gonna tape off all the area. We're gonna have search teams working all through the night. Okay? I want you two to stay here in case she comes back. Why? Don't you think we should be looking with you? Yeah, what are we gonna do? I told you I'll be honest with you, and I will. This runner, he's armed and he's dangerous. Now I don't think he has your daughter, I don't. I don't want you out in the woods while he's running loose. You stay here, I'll have my men protect you. Take this. As soon as we get any update, I'll have the team call you and let you know right away. If you need anything, you call me. Anytime. Thirty-two years I've been in this department come May, and I've never lost a child. Not one. And I don't plan to. We'll find her. - Okay? - Yeah. Easy, easy, shh, shh. It's okay. We should be out there searching too. There is a team of police out there, Wendy. Just stop. They're looking for her. They'll find her. Please. Please, Paul. We have to look for her. What if the convict has her? We gotta sneak by the cops. If they see us... they'll stop us. Taylor! Taylor! - Taylor! - Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! What is that? It looks like a campfire. That's him, they said he'd been shot. Wendy, stop, we have to get the police. No, he'll be gone by then. We have to hold him here. I'll grab the gun. Wendy. Wait, stop. Wendy, stop. Shh, shh. Give me the gun. Wendy, give me the... Did you hear that? Sounds like it came from the other side of the lake. Get your men over there now. Let's move! We have to tell them. Tell them what? - The truth. - We can't do that. We have to. It was an accident. Honey, you could tell them. You could tell them a guy tried to attack you and, you know... he's an escaped convict for fuck's sake. Eh, who's gonna miss him? Did 'em a favor. Paul. We have to tell them the truth. They'll take you away, Wendy. I'm not gonna let that happen, okay? You understand that I would do anything to keep that from happening. I'm not gonna lose both of you, okay? We gotta stick together on this. That's the only way we're gonna get through this. We have to tell them the truth. Mr. And Mrs. Michaelson. Hello? It's the sheriff, hello? Anybody home? Yeah, hang on! Hey, Sheriff, how you doing? You wanna come on in? Wendy's just in the back getting dressed, so. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was a long night, you know. Yeah, how you doing? You want some coffee? Thanks, yeah. Sugar if you have any. I do. I've yet to get to sleep myself. Yeah. Any news? Let's wait till your wife comes out, and we can all talk. Easier that way. Okay. What's that? What's what? - That coffee maker. - Oh, this... I was thinking about getting one of those for my wife. You know, I don't know what that is. Something my wife picked up, you know. I don't even know where the hell she got it. Um, I can add a little sugar. I think I got just enough left here. There we go. Okay. Here you go. Shit! I'm so sorry! - God, Jesus! - All right. - I'm so sorry. - It's all right. Gosh, I'm just so jittery this morning. Rough night, man. Just, you know. Sheriff. How you doing? Why don't you sit down? Let's all sit down for a minute. Well, we found the escaped inmate. Sheriff. Arrested him on a bus... trying to cross state lines. Questioned him, and there's no indication that he has anything to do with the disappearance of your daughter. - Oh, thank God. - Hmm. Yeah. Good. Both of you heard that gunshot last night, but we looked into it this morning, and on the south side of the lake, we found the body of a camper. Been killed. Wait, I don't understand. You found a camper... Survivor. He was a survival weekend guys. They come up here from time to time, to just spend the weekend trying to survive off the land. Sometimes a little longer. Uh-huh. So, do you think there's some kind of connection between... Right now, we're treating it as two separate cases. That's the best way to go about it. There's no indication there is any connection. Your daughter's out there, we're gonna find her. Sure. Yeah, I mean, what else, yeah. I'm gonna need you to come down to the station. Okay. Well, what for, why? Well, we need to file a official missing person report. It's been over 24 hours now. Bring some pictures, some videos. Anything you think might help. Sure. We'll be there. We'll be there. ...take a search party around the other side of the lake. What have I done? What have I done? What have I done? I killed a man. I killed a man. I killed... I killed an innocent man. Oh, my God, I killed... There's nothing we can do about that, you hear me? I killed an innocent man. Taylor is missing. We need to focus on that, okay? Hey, hey, it was an accident, okay? I, uh... I'm real sorry to hear about your daughter. Yeah, yeah, thank you. I'm Justin. I take care of this place. - Justin, I'm Paul. - Paul. This is my wife, Wendy. You guys must be pretty bummed. I mean, the cops asked me if I saw anything weird and I was just dumping trash in the Gator, you know. I didn't see nothing. It was just like... It's like any other day, you know? Thanks. How old was she? Ten. Why? Why did you ask how old she was? Why did you say "was"? He said "How old was she?" Is that what he just asked? - How old was my daughter? - No, no, I didn't mean that. I was just thinking, um... I don't know why I said that. All right, thank you, Justin. Okay, anyway, if you guys need anything or whatever, I'm in my trailer at site four just around there, all right. Okay. I heard about the dead camper, that's pretty fucked. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What is going on? What... What's happening? Yeah, we come to fill out a missing persons report, okay, - but I feel like you guys are treating us like criminals here. - Yeah, yeah. Standard procedure I'm afraid. I know it doesn't feel very good. Feel very good? It's just... isn't this wasting time? - I mean, this time here... - We're combing the lake. There's a lot of land to cover. We'll get it done. - Tell us how this gets our daughter back? - Yeah. I wanna get her face out there. The more eyes looking for her, the better. And better it come from you. People tend to listen a bit more that way. What... What are you talking about? Press conference. Jeffrey Michaelson, that your father? My brother. All right. Might wanna give your family a call, let 'em know what's going on. Oh. At this time, we have no indications that Taylor Michaelson has been kidnapped or that there is any foul play. The homicide in the woods is a separate case until we find a connection that says otherwise. If you are part of a fire or a police reserve and would like to volunteer to join the search, please contact my office. The Michaelsons would like to make a statement. We pray to God that our daughter, Taylor, comes back to us unharmed. I would do anything to get my daughter back. Ah, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Hey, Jeffrey, it's your brother. Listen, Wendy and I are having a little trouble with Taylor. So... So give me a call, okay. Please. Shh. Lucky! - Lucky, hey, Lucky! - Hey! Hi, sorry. I hope we're not interrupting. We thought maybe you guys might be hungry, so we brought you some dinner. - Wow. - I'm Eric. - Hi. - You've already met my wife, Miranda. Yep. Yep. Thanks. Wendy. I'm Wendy. Hi. It's the least we could do. Feel free to join us if you want. Oh, no, thank you. We don't wanna intrude. Plus, the police told us that we could help search tonight. Eric is a reserve fireman... Part-time. I'm a musician. Hey, hey, quiet! I'm sorry about that. That's all right. I'm not really a big dog person. They can tell. Look, we can only imagine how hard this must be. So if there's anything that you need, we'd... Thanks, guys, thank you. We really... We really appreciate it. - Just let us know. - Sure. Thanks for the help. Uh-huh. What's going on, Wendy? Our daughter is missing, and you're inviting Miss Congeniality to dinner! Hey, hey, what the hell are you talking about, Wendy? I'm trying to be a nice guy. - Nice? - Yeah. Nice? You don't think I saw the way that you looked at her? Huh? You don't think that maybe if you didn't get distracted - our daughter wouldn't still... - Okay, stop, stop! - ...be in this trailer? - Stop, stop! Okay, I know what this is about. All right, don't blame me. Do you think that's gonna bring her back? Hmm? It was a long time ago, Wendy. I told you that would never happen again, and that's what I meant. Okay, I fucked up! But don't keep beating me up about it! Taylor's the only reason I'm with you! - Knock it off! - Taylor's the only reason - I'm with you! - Stop it! - We don't have anything, Paul! - Shh! We don't have anything, Paul! We don't have anything without Taylor! What do we have, Paul? What do we have? Tell me, what do we have without our daughter? We have each other. Hey, hey, hey. We have each other. That's all we have, and we're gonna get through this. Together. - You and me. - We'll get through it. - You and me. - We're all right. Are you getting anywhere on that little girl's disappearance? You can't take it home with you, John. It's not fair to me. There's some thunder and lightning outside, and I miss you! Mwah! And I have three friends that... three friends that are Korean, that one of them knows Korean. It's... Happy birthday, and they went up in front of the whole class and sang it to everybody. This is how you sing it. We gotta get some sleep. Come on. You haven't slept in two days. Oh, I know. - Come to bed with me. - No, I can't. I mean, I want to, but I can't. I've already taken two Ambien. My body's so tired, but I cannot stop my mind from racing. Eric... Eric told the police that he was watching TV. There's no cable here. Eric. And Lucky... Lucky was looking at them. Lucky was barking. Lucky never barks at anybody like that. Why was he barking at him like that? - Okay. - Why? Why? Why? Why do dogs do anything? Where you going? Going to bed? I'm gonna call the sheriff. What? Give me that! - What? Give it to me. - Hey! - What are you doing? - To tell him what? Ow! - Are you okay? - Yeah, but what are you gonna tell him? - I was gonna tell him that the guy was lying! - Our dog barked? You know what, they said that they were gonna go help with the search party, right? So maybe we should just... go look around. - Give me that. - What? That's crazy. Come on. You and me are going to bed. That's what we're gonna do. Now come on. - What if she's over there? - Huh? What if Taylor is over there tied up? Fifty feet away. Paul. Don't slam it. I'll check the back. Damn it. Hey, did you check? Yeah. Sorry. Paul. Yeah. Prenatal drugs. That's clomiphene. IVF injectors, prenatal vitamins. They were trying to have a baby. Okay. What if they were trying to have a baby so badly that they took ours instead? Or maybe they're just trying to have a baby. - Come on. - She said that they were newlyweds. What? They're newlyweds. What if Miranda was distracting you so that her husband could take our daughter? Okay, so, what'd they do with her? The compartments down below. Nothing there. Look at this one here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hurry up. Oh... locked. - Hi. - Jesus... Christ, you guys scared us. Man, we were just coming back to see if you guys were back yet. - We were wondering... - Yeah. if anybody found anything. Anybody find anything? No. Uh... They're still out there. We just came back 'cause she wasn't feeling well. Yeah, I didn't get much sleep last night. Me neither. Yeah, I'm sure we could all use a little sleep. So, you know, it's just been one of those days. So let's go. Good night. Come on, honey. But, you know, hey, you guys. You know, Paul and I were thinking of sneaking one of the fishing boats out in the morning to search the lake, but they won't let us search, but they'd let you, so maybe if we go together? - Uh, I... - Yeah, absolutely. We'll meet you guys at the dock at 7 a.m. Okay, thank you. Wow. - Thanks. - Good night. Come on. Shh, Lucky! Shh! Shh, shh. Baby! Shh, hey! Shut up. Hey, shh, shh. Right there, right there. What are you doing? Are you serious right now? - Hey. - Knock it off. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, please, Paul. Wendy. Would you knock it off? You're completely nuts. - I said, stop. - Shut up, honey. Get off me. Oh, my God. Just get off me. Don't do that. Don't do that. Where'd you go? Listen, about last night, I wanted to tell you... I don't wanna talk about that. Fine. Uh... You wanna tell me what we're doing here? I thought you didn't even like these people, then you wanna invite 'em out for an afternoon on the lake. We are getting them alone, gonna get information, and then we're gonna go to the police. We can go to the police now and tell them what we found. That's a good idea. After we tell them that we broke into their RV and searched through all their belongings, maybe we can tell them that I killed a camper too! - Good morning! - Good morning. Thanks for doing this, guys. We appreciate it. - Yeah. - Yeah, no worries. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Get us off the dock here. Okay. We're good. Maybe we should head back now. I think we're almost out of gas. Hey, wait. There's something... There's something floating over there. Right on the edge of the lake, look. See? Oh, yeah, no, I see it. I mean, it's something... Something's floating over there. What is it? It looks like a plastic trash bag. - No. - Come on, guys. We've been out here six hours, getting dehydrated. We should head back, get some food, refuel. It's just a bag. We can take a quick look, all right. Come on. Come on. Okay, okay, okay. Let me see it. Go back now? You wanna open it or...? - You didn't even wanna look. - Huh? He didn't wanna look. How... How are you so sure? Well, I wasn't. But it looked like a plastic bag, and it was, so I guess I was right about that. Damn it! We're out of gas. I was right about that too. Shit! Maybe you didn't wanna look because you were sure that it wasn't her. What? Wendy. I don't mind asking them a few questions, okay, but let's not just start accusing people... Wait, wait, wait, questions? What questions? For example, how is the honeymoon going? Huh? Look, guys, I don't know what you're talking about, but we're stranded out here. It's gonna take a long time to row back. I think what my wife is trying to say is that we just find it a little ironic that you guys are trying to have a kid and our kid goes missing. How do you know that? We found the IVF. If you have her, just give her back to us. - You go through our shit? - We won't say anything, I promise we won't. We're out here trying to help and they're fucking accusing us! Calm down, Eric. They're obviously going through a lot. You know, and just think, like, you guys are newlyweds, but you've been trying to have a kid for years. It just looks a little, you know. Don't even answer that question! I'm gonna row us back myself, when we get back we're getting the hell out of here. Fuck these people! Get out of my way. Fuck you! I am so sorry. - You're not going anywhere. - Jesus, fuck! - What? - No, honey, I'm sorry. You're not going anywhere. You're gonna answer a couple of questions. You better get your wife in check before someone gets hurt. Wendy, put the gun down. She's not normally like this. - She's not a violent person. - I feel it in my body. I feel it. I know you can feel it. They have her. What are you talking about? We never said we were newlyweds. We've been married for five years. We spent all of our money trying to have a kid so we decided to take this trip, just focus on us, and forget about having kids. Until you found our daughter and you thought that you could have - one of your own. - No! We would never do something like that. You are lying. - This game is over, we're done! - Paul! You protecting your little girlfriend? What are you talking about? You thought I was sleeping? I watched you. I watched you watch her. Oh, you're good. You like being watched, a lot. Maybe it's because my husband could get me pregnant and hers can't. That's enough! Jesus! Wendy! Hey! Hey! Hey! Wendy! Wendy! God! You okay? Hang on to the boat! Oh, God, you're okay. Are you okay? Are you okay? Oh, God. - Where's Miranda? - I don't know. I don't know. Okay, let's go, let's go. Let's go right now. Got a minute? Yep. What is it? FBI called again. Not their territory. This ain't connected yet. What if it's connected to the dead camper in the woods? - No proof of that. - Look, John... this isn't looking good, all right. I'm just saying, maybe we can use some help. Who you working for? Huh? Rakes, get Tim Bradley on the phone, tell him the situation, get him down here. Anything you wanna tell me? Any detail come back in? Every piece of information matters. Sheriff... we feel so helpless. Well, there's someone I'd like you to talk to. I think he might be able to help you. His name is Dr. Bradley. He's a grief counselor. We have nothing to grieve. Taylor is still out there. You said you would find her. You said that you would find her. You need to come see this. This mean anything to you? It's... it's Taylor's. It's Taylor's favorite necklace. Where did you find it? Hudson's RV. Eric Hudson's been stabbed multiple times. So at this point, high probability your daughter's been abducted. We got an APB out for his wife, Miranda. We'll get some answers. I had lied to you. I told you I'd never lost a child. I lost one. My son. A few years back. Drug addiction. And it's a pain that no one should ever go through. And the reason I can make sure you don't have to. My word. Oh, my... What are we gonna tell him? We gotta tell him something! They're wasting time looking for Miranda. Yeah. They are not gonna find her. She's dead. - Shh! - How are they gonna find her? We don't know that for sure. Well, Eric's dead. Eric's dead. We are murderers. No, no, that was an accident. - No, once is an accident, twice? - God damn it. What do you want me to do, Wendy? - I don't know. - Fuck, for all we know, they did do it! Right? - If they did it, where is she? - I don't know! - Maybe they took her somewhere! - Where is Taylor? Maybe they had an accomplice. They hid her, okay. Or they gave her to somebody. We can't ask them now. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Jesus. Shut up. I saw you talking to the sheriff. - So? - So? Don't play games with me. I didn't say anything, all right? - I'm scared, Tom. - What are you scared of? Dead bodies keep popping up all over. I don't like this, Tom, and I need some answers. Like what? Did you kill those people? I've known you since you were 14, took you in when no one else wanted you, hired you, fed you... treated you like a son, you're gonna ask me that? That's what I'm asking you, Tom, 'cause I know you. I know all about you. I know everything. I didn't kill those people. Well, did you take that little girl? Don't you ever insult me like that again! You understand me? You understand me? Yeah, yeah. Here. Now get. Just don't drag me into any of your shit! You're welcome! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Dinner's getting cold. How can you eat right now? Wendy, I haven't eaten in three days, okay. I haven't slept in three days. And even if we do get Taylor back, guess what? When the police find out what we did, we're all going to jail, okay? So this, right now, is all we've got. And I'm not gonna sit around wasting it by worrying. All right? So please, come sit down. Why don't we just try to have a semblance of a nice, normal night? You wanna watch a movie after dinner? Ah. Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh! Okay. - We're closed. - Yeah, I... Sorry. You scared me. Uh, I was... I had some... I'm sorry, I already opened the chocolate. Be a dollar for the candy bar plus the videos. - I don't have a wallet. - Of course. Write down what you take, time in and time out, and I'll put it on your bill. So generous. Considering the circumstances. Fine, if it'll make you feel better, I won't charge you for the candy bar, but make sure you bring those back. Will do. Hey! Sorry about your daughter. I rented out some movies. Well, that's great. So we can have a nice, normal night of camping. Yeah, oh, what about this one? It's one of Taylor's favorites. It's where a daddy fish loses a baby fish. Or, oh, yeah, I got an action movie about abduction. Or... Oh, what about this one? This one flew over the cuckoo's nest. That's one you can relate to, isn't it, Paul? Or maybe we could go out to the campfire and finally make those s'mores you were talking about! Enough! Nice dinner. Paul! Shut up. Let's have that glass of wine, Paul! Fuck off! It's pretty good. Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, Paul! Lucky. Lucky, quiet. What, what, what? What are you barking for? Come here. Yeah? - I'm sorry to bother you... - Don't. Um, it's a beautiful night. - How are you doing today? - Peachy. Sorry, I'm not too good at talking to people. I seem to say the wrong things. I just wanted to say I really hope you guys find your daughter. You know, alive. Okay. This is for you. Okay, thanks. Have a good night. Shit! Taylor, Taylor, honey! Hey! Hey, I found her! Hey, over here! Help! Come back to me, please! Please, honey, please, come back to me! Taylor! Honey, come back to me! Get inside. Looks like someone screwed the pooch. Make sure you get a good shot of those cuts right there. I wanna know, what the hell is going on here, okay? Our daughter is still missing. You got some dead guy in the woods over there. These guys are either dead or missing, so please, tell me where the hell everybody was this morning? It's Thanksgiving day. I pulled these men from their tables. Everyone else we got is out in the woods looking for your daughter. I forgot about that, Jesus. How's your wife? How the hell do you think she is, man? Somebody murdered our dog! You don't know that. It could be an animal. An animal? Listen, last night, my wife said she saw that creepy kid Justin doing drugs. And this morning, I hear him, he's buzzing all over the campground on his Gator. - Drugs, where? - Doing drugs in that van back there that he lives in, okay. He comes to my wife last night, and he hands her a chocolate bar, all right. Acting strange, stranger than usual. So, you know, she follows him. She sees him. He's smoking something out of a glass pipe. We'll bring him in, and we'll talk to him. I think it's time for you and Mrs. Michaelson, maybe you go to a hotel. A hotel? We're not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere until my daughter is back here with me safely! Bag it up. You got it. Forensics found a hair under Eric Hudson's ring. Well, their records are clean. Find the wife. FBI called again! Not now! Wendy, open the door. Hey, Wendy! Wendy, open the door or I'll break it down! Hey, you okay in there? Yeah. I just need to sleep. Maybe I should have a lawyer present. Something you need a lawyer for? No, I just don't feel real comfortable right now. Well, you're not arrested. We're just talking. You and me. Anything you wanna tell me? I don't know nothing. Don't know nothing about that dog? What dog? Okay, okay. Well I know some things. That your mama left you when you were 10. You never knew your daddy. In and out of juvie for years and years, drugs. Drugs, drugs, drugs, petty theft. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. I got a warrant for that van of yours, what do you think I'd find? - Drugs. - I don't do drugs anymore. I'm clean. - You're lying. You're lying, Justin. - I don't. No, I'm not. Drugs make you lie. That's what they do. They keep you from being yourself. Make you do things you normally wouldn't do. All right? My son was an addict. I didn't even know it. That's how good a liar he was. Time I found out, it's too late. I don't want that for you. I'm here to help you. But I need you to help me first. Now what happened to the little girl? - Yeah, you know something. - No I don't. No I don't. Whether you saw, whether you overheard something. You were all around there. Come on, now. What, you're trying to protect someone? Is that it? Miranda Hudson, is that it? Huh? Mr. Henry? I told you... I told you, I don't know nothing, all right? I don't know nothing. You don't know nothing about those two dead people neither? No, no. Well, let me let you in on a little secret. We got a hair of the killer. It's only a matter of time before we know who he is. You might wanna look up that lawyer. You might need that. Tell you what... give him a card. Call me, you know where I am. Maybe something will come back to you. Baker. What? Shit. She gonna be okay? She swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills. We just pumped her. She is gonna be okay, she just needs some rest. Her husband's in there with her right now. I think we'll see that grief counselor now, sheriff. I want you to know you're not alone in this. You have each other. It's important that you lean on one another in times of duress. There are five stages to losing a loved one. Although you haven't officially lost your daughter forever, you are still experiencing a sense of loss, and going through those stages. Denial, anger, bargaining. I'll do anything to get my daughter back. Placing blame on others, and then moving into depression. You might fluctuate between those stages until you arrive at the final stage. Acceptance. That last stage, well, in your situation, staying hopeful and supportive of each other. In many couples, a wedge can be created. They can blame each other. It can erode the marriage. But by leaning on each other for support, the relationship can strengthen. You must not give up hope, but you also must not get stuck in those other stages. It'll lead you into a downward spiral. It's a fine line between denial and hope. Acceptance means letting go. Letting go of that which is not in your control. Hey, whoa! - Everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah, just returning tapes, okay? Hello? Come sit on the bed. No, I don't want to. I'm not gonna hurt you, darling. You don't need to be scared. Come on. Come sit next to me. Wendy! Oh, shit. Have you seen my wife? Nope. I'm gonna grab some sugar. We're closed. It'll take you like a minute. Make it quick. Take it, it's on me. Thanks. Hey, you sure you haven't seen Wendy? Nope. She must've dropped 'em off earlier. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah? About when was that? I don't know, we were closed. Oh, yeah. Thanks for the sugar. At around 11 p.m. last night, the RV park owner Mr. Tom Henry was killed after attacking Mrs. Michaelson in the back room of the RV front office, which contained child pornography. At this time, we believe that Mr. Henry was behind the disappearance of Taylor Michaelson. We speculate that he may be involved in an underground child pornography ring and may be involved in the murder of Eric Hudson and the disappearance of his wife, Miranda Hudson. We still do not know the whereabouts of Taylor Michaelson. We fear that Mr. Henry has taken the secret to his grave. Mr. and Mrs. Michaelson have asked for privacy during this time and are declining any further press statements. We ask that if you have any information regarding Taylor Michaelson, that you please come forward and contact the sheriff's department, thank you. Want you to know this investigation isn't over. I will continue to work around the clock to get your daughter back. Thank you. We're pulling the teams from the lake. I don't think she's there. Gotta focus our manpower on the leader of that tape ring. I'm hoping there's some kind of connection, maybe find out where she is. Just got off the phone with the FBI, filled them in. They're sending someone up from their field office up north. Should be here tomorrow afternoon. Makes sense. Try to get some sleep. You find anything in Justin's van? Nope. Kid's staying quiet. Well... we have the FBI. Try to throw scare on him tomorrow. I'm sorry, John. I know you wanted this one. What are you doing? She's not coming back. We gotta stop torturing ourselves. Wait... Give... Give me the box. No. Wendy. I can't do this anymore. I can't. I can't look at this stuff. Everywhere I look, I've been seeing her... and not you. You understand? You just wanna throw away every memory of her, you wanna forget? - No, no, no. - Is that what you want, Paul? - Just give me the box. Give me the box! - No. Wendy, Wendy! - Give me this box! - Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy. I-I... I can't do it. No. No. I'm not playing this game anymore, so... I'm sorry. Taylor's gone. Not coming back. We need to accept that. We need to accept that. This is Sheriff Baker, leave a message. Marianne! Hello. Rakes, we do a background check on the Michaelsons? Yeah, records were clean. Dad was a decorated veteran, nothing else came up, why? What about the kid? The kid, why would we? I mean, I didn't think she'd have any arrests. I'm looking at a picture here of Mrs. Michaelson about nine months pregnant, in the background is the Twin Towers. So? So the Twin Towers went down 17 years ago. So how could Taylor Michaelson possibly be 10 years old? On that missing persons form, there's an emergency contact. I believe it's his brother. - Get a hold of him. - Shit. Shit! Taylor accidentally drowned in Wolf River Harbor, Canada, six years ago while on an RV camping trip. They were in therapy for a while, but they stopped going. They have these shared delusional episodes where they both think Taylor's still alive. It's a syndrome called folie à deux. Sometimes one will be more in it than the other. I mean, they usually just play this game at home. Making breakfast for her, talking to her. The worst it ever got was they took her to school one day, but no one ever got hurt. I thought it was their way to cope, to keep their marriage together. You know, I mean, they can function in the real world, both have good jobs, so I just told my wife to leave them alone if it helps them. Hey, forensics got a match on that DNA sample found in Eric Hudson's ring. Paul Michaelson's. What's happening? Is everything okay? Police, open up! - Can I help you? - There was a couple parked in that RV spot, you see anything? Yeah, there was an RV when we first got here, but... but they left. You see anyone else? Groundskeeper, anyone? No, no one else was around and there was no one at the front desk. Should we be worried? Are these people dangerous? Where's your kid? What? Where's your kid? She was out by the swing set. Cindy! Cindy! - Cindy! Cindy! Cindy! - Cindy! Oh! Cindy! Cindy! I'm right here, Mama! Oh, God! - Are you okay? - Are you okay? There are five stages to losing a loved one. Denial. Everywhere I look, I've been seeing her. Anger. - Fuck! - We don't have anything, Paul! Taylor is the only reason I'm with you! She is the glue! What do we have without her? Enough! Bargaining. You understand that I would do anything to keep that from happening. I'm not gonna lose both of you. Placing blame on others. That's Taylor's favorite necklace. Moving into depression. It might fluctuate between those stages. We have to tell them the truth. I'm not gonna play this game anymore. We're murderers, Paul. You must not give up hope, but you also must not get stuck in those other stages. Wendy and I are having a little trouble with Taylor. It leads you into a downward spiral. It's a fine line between denial and hope. Acceptance means letting go. Letting go of that which is not in your control. Dad, you want me to feed Lucky before we go to the lake? That would be great! ♪ Ten bottles of beer On the wall, ten... ♪ How you doing back there, cutie? You still sick? Gotta throw up? - A little. - We're almost there. Can we go fishing when we get there, Dad? Oh, honey, when we get there, I'm gonna hang that sign around my neck, 'cause you and me, we are gone fishing, sweetheart.
