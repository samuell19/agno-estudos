[Bearden] The CIA director says, "I want you to go out there and win this." [Coll] I was the Washington Post correspondent in, uh, South Asia, so the Afghan War was pretty much the biggest story on my beat. Pakistan had an immediate refugee flow. They went to their ally, the United States, and said, "We've got all these rebels who are coming into our country as refugees. They want to liberate their country from Soviet occupation. We, the Pakistan government, are inclined to help them, but we could use your support as well." And so we were told to get busy and try to figure out what was happening with these guys called the mujahideen. [Sageman] People knew that the CIA was supporting the Afghans.

[Schroen] We were putting in a variety of weapons systems into the hands of the mujahideen. The United States started to provide these Stinger antiaircraft missiles to equip the rebels to fight the Soviets as equals. They started knocking Soviet aircraft out of the sky by the hundreds.

The result was that an Afghanistan so overloaded with ordnance and awash with money slipped into its own devices. [Coll] From a war correspondent's perspective, by the time I was traveling around in the war in the early '90s, it had become a nasty civil war. [Constable] The thing I remember most was how lonely it was. Kabul was like a ghost city. You could stand in a major intersection, which now has endless clogged traffic jams, and see no one and hear nothing but bicycle spokes and horse carriage bells. It was very haunting. [man] yelling in native language [Constable] There was rape. There was robbery. Buildings were rocketed and shot all the time. People were terrified. [Semple] Out of the fight, street by street in Kabul, replicated in the sort of districts of the country, we got the Taliban movement. I can recall the precise moment in which I learnt of the Taliban movement. I was at a garden party, and a posh Englishman told me about this supposedly Islamic student movement which had just taken over a swath of territory in Kandahar and was chasing after these money-grubbing, gun-wielding, you know, commanders left over from the mujahideen, hanging them up from trees and posts and stuffing money in their mouths, and he told me, "Michael, this looks like the next big thing," um, and he was right. [Coll] The Taliban advertised themselves as a kind of purifying force, a cleansing force that would reunify Afghanistan under the banner of Islam. [Schroen] That was very attractive to the Pakistanis. They didn't want Afghanistan to be a threat, and so the Pakistani government threw their weight militarily and financially behind the Taliban, and by early 1996, they controlled three-fourths of Afghanistan. [Coll] They often conquered without firing a shot. They would just ride into a town holding Korans in the air or waving the flags of, uh, their movement or of Islam, and whole garrisons would just, uh, change sides. [Constable] The gratitude began to fade and be replaced with something else when it became clear that the Taliban wanted to enforce an extremely restrictive version of Islam. I went to Afghanistan as a journalist, I think, five or six times, and that meant that you had to get a visa from the Taliban government, which meant that you were there under very limited and very strict conditions, and there were many conditions. Number one, you had to completely cover yourself except your face. Number two, you couldn't meet with women. Number three, you couldn't take pictures of anything. I had a camera, a small camera, hidden under my voluminous scarf, and we stopped at a bakery to buy some bread, and I saw this boy's face through the window, and I just ducked into the bakery, and I got out my camera, and I just took this one single picture of him, and then I left. ♪♪♪ There was no music, no-no TV, no phone system to speak of.

The strategic aspect of the relationship was telling them what is terrorism, what is bin Laden, what is al-Qaeda, and what type of threat does it pose to U.S. interest in the wider region and how we should, uh, cope with it. Of course, they were not very receptive of our strategic analysis. They were showing very little interest to the hosts of al-Qaeda.

They weren't very large in number. They weren't very military effective. They didn't have any fighting experience. But they got together, and he founded al-Qaeda over the course of a couple of weekends in Pakistan in August of 1988. It was a very secretive organization. [Coll] They really didn't have very many places to go, and Afghanistan was one place where bin Laden thought he could establish al-Qaeda's headquarters. [Bergen] In '96, I read a State Department report about bin Laden saying he's financing Islamic extremism. He's recruited all of these Arabs from around the world, and he could be a problem.

[Bergen] That is when it became clear that bin Laden and al-Qaeda was really a big deal and could-- not only were spouting all this anti-American rhetoric but trying to kill, you know, large numbers of Americans. [Bill Clinton] There is convincing information from our intelligence community that the bin Laden terrorist network was responsible for these bombings. [Grenier] Bin Laden was constantly moving, and we were using Afghan tribal networks to report on his travels and his whereabouts. Our tribal contacts came to us, and they said, "Look, he's in this location now. When he leaves, he's gonna have to go through this particular crossroads," and so what they proposed was to bury a huge cache of explosives underneath those crossroads so that when his convoy came through, they could simply blow it up. And we said, "Absolutely not." We were risking jail if we didn't tell them that, because the CIA had a so-called lethal finding that had been signed by President Clinton which said that we could engage in "lethal activity" against bin Laden, but the purpose of our attack on bin Laden couldn't be to kill him. We were being asked to remove this threat to the United States essentially with one hand tied behind our backs. [Martin] I was a fairly junior officer, and as al-Qaeda grew into a worldwide presence, we were very sensitive and very aware of this growing phenomenon. It's not like they were playing. The threat was real. And if President Clinton had taken action and killed Osama bin Laden, there wouldn't have been a 9/11. If there wouldn't have been a 9/11, there wouldn't have been Afghanistan.

[man] The Taliban have now made it clear that they will not bow to American pressure. At a chaotic press conference at their embassy in Islamabad, they threatened holy war if attacked and rejected President Bush's demand to surrender Osama bin Laden. Are you willing to hand Osama bin Laden to the United States or not? No, no, no, no. [Mohseni] Well, for the Taliban, there was an opportunity for them to distance, uh, the movement from these groups and individuals, and we were hoping they wouldn't, because, uh, for us, it was an opportunity to actually rid Afghanistan of the Taliban. And as we expected, they stuck to their guns, and they did not in any way compromise, and that was the beginning of the end for them, at least in that period. [Schroen] When 9/11 happened, they called me in. Basically, they said, "Will you take the first team in? We got to--we want to put a team together." I said, "Oh, God, everybody in the United States wants to do this, and they're giving me the job, be the first people to hit back at bin Laden?" I said, "Yeah, better believe it." [Bernsten] When I entered, you know, I had my orders. I had an operational directive to execute on the ground. Number one, destroy the Taliban because they're in the way. We have to get at al-Qaeda. Number two, kill every member of al-Qaeda that you can find on the battlefield. Number three, find and kill bin Laden. ♪♪♪ [Schroen] Well, when we left, chief of Counterterrorism Center said-- We met him on the morning we were getting ready to leave, and he said, "I'm gonna give you your orders now.

And, historically, when presidents have wanted to go over to the dark side, they've asked the CIA to do it. [Cheney] A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly without any discussion, using sources and methods, uh, that are available to our intelligence agencies. [Gossman] The first trip I took was in 1994, Human Rights Watch. The war had continued. The Soviets had gone, but the war was continuing, which was sort of-- came to be the story over the many years I went to Afghanistan. Despite whatever political changes happened, the war almost had a life of its own and continued. The first boots on the ground after 9/11 were the CIA, and very quickly, they began working with and bolstering militia groups to work with, and those groups were designed, recruited, and trained to go after leading al-Qaeda or Taliban figures. [Coll] The CIA was transformed as an institution by 9/11. Out of that came the, uh, structure that is now notorious... the black sites, the enhanced interrogation techniques, the waterboarding, and the rest. When I joined the agency in the 1980s, only the bad guys used those techniques on us. Unlike the FBI, the agency really did not have any skill in interrogation, especially hostile interrogation. That was something new. [Martin] I can honestly say I know what attacks were stopped. I know how hard the folks worked, and I also know they weren't emotional. People weren't having fun waterboarding people. [Maddox] I would never say that I am in support of torture or anything in that regard, but there was definitely a push technically and in human intelligence to get as much information as possible, and you have to put yourself back in that particular time in history. When I think about... when I think about the kids and the-and the-and the- and the women and children and good Americans who are still alive because of what we did, you know what I say? I say, "Fuck history. Fuck history." As far as that program, I slept good at night. [Gossman] I did a briefing on it for all the ambassadors in Kabul, and I had said that the torture that had been described by people who had investigated the secret detentions, the salt pit, the case of people being left out, dying of hypothermia, and the rest of it, these kinds of torture and secret detentions had been known in the Soviet times. It was shocking for them to be coming up again in post-2001 Afghanistan. The Americans didn't come to the briefing, but they came immediately afterwards and wanted to see me. When I was approached by one of them, he was so angry, he was shaking. The very fact I dared compare those abuses to what had happened with the Soviets had infuriated him, and I'm just like-- that's what infuriated him, not the fact that they happened but that I had made a comparison with the Soviets.

It's an area that he knew very well. He'd been going through that area during the '80s, fighting the Soviets. It's an area-- he liked being there. He, uh--he had, like, a vacation home there, which wouldn't be my first choice of vacation spot. [Bernsten] We knew that bin Laden was moving with a group of about 1,000 people. Right away they said, "Okay, we're gonna go pursue him." I said, "Do it. Send them in." We go up. They get up on top of a promontory mountain piece, and then down below, there's bin Laden and his huge element.

There's always in the back of the minds of Afghans that-that suspicion of ulterior motives. ♪♪♪ [Saleh] United States got distracted, and they wanted to show that Afghanistan was still this good story working and it is rosy, and they were not... they were not listening to us, you know? ♪♪♪ [Grenier] I had great misgivings because I felt that the CIA needed to stay engaged with key political players inside Afghanistan, but I could see very quickly that there was very little appetite, uh, for doing that. It's not that we didn't know Afghanistan was going badly after that. We did, but we couldn't do anything about it, because by the time Iraq started to go bad, Afghanistan was also going bad, and we were caught in a war in two fronts without the resources to deal with both. ♪♪♪ [George W. Bush] America's men and women in uniform took away al-Qaeda's safe haven in Afghanistan, and we will not allow them to reestablish it in Iraq. So I have committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq. The agreement lays out a framework for the withdrawal of American forces in Iraq, a withdrawal that is possible because of the success of the surge. [man] yelling in foreign language [man] While Iraq has dominated the headlines, the less-publicized fight in Afghanistan has intensified. [Obama] My fellow citizens, our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. [cheers and applause] For six years, Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq. It is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. Well, I think that in the last year, we've made a lot of progress. [Petraeus] Two thousand ten will be a year that will see progress and a reversal of Taliban momentum. [woman] Well, the financial and human cost of the War in Afghanistan has gone up every year over the past five years, more than 1,600 U.S. troops. This past year in Afghanistan was the deadliest yet for American troops. [Petraeus] Momentum achieved by the Taliban in Afghanistan since 2005 has been arrested in much of the country. I wish I could tell you that this war was simple, but that's not the way of counterinsurgencies. They are fraught with both successes and setbacks, which can exist in the same space and in the same time, and I believe the campaign is on track. ♪♪♪ [Coll] If you ask the question, "Why are we here?" as President Obama did when he came into office in 2009, "Why are we fighting in Afghanistan?" well, his best experts gathered and advised him, "Sir, we're here because al-Qaeda is still a threat to the United States. Bin Laden's still alive. We got to finish the job." [McRaven] Every year, there was this sense that if we did X, Y, and Z, maybe we could finish up the war. [Obama] Tonight I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda. [McRaven] And this will go down as one of the great missions in the history of the intelligence community. As I was planning the mission, you had to have surprise. We had surprise. You had to have speed. We're coming in by helicopters. And you had to have purpose, and God knows these-these, uh, SEALs and soldiers had purpose. They were going after the most wanted man in the world. It was about who we are as Americans. This man and his people had attacked New York and Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., and we had an obligation to spend as long as it took to bring him to justice. ♪♪♪ [Coll] We did get bin Laden. Al-Qaeda is diminished. It's scattered. It's under pressure. We have been killing people with our drones for a good while now, so why are we still here? ♪♪♪ [engine whirring] ♪♪♪ As the war in Afghanistan went on and on, the CIA then got into the secret air war business, which is really what the drone campaign was. It was a secret air war designed to do what the United States was not prepared to do through conventional means. The CIA was given charge of that because it wasn't going to be declared. It wasn't going to be run by the Air Force or by the special operations groups at the Pentagon. It was, uh, covert, and so that added to the sense that the CIA was-- became an agency at war. [Bergen] It's a new way of war. The United States government wouldn't even acknowledge this was really happening, and-and when they did acknowledge it, privately they would say, "There's no civilian casualties." Well, that wasn't true. [man] In Afghanistan, NATO is investing a U.S. air strike on Thursday that may have killed a child in Helmand Province. [Raddatz] Whatever the benefit of the drone strikes, they have created enormous resentment among some here in the region who view the strikes as another sign of American arrogance. [Bergen] And you can see, this is by administration, so under George W. Bush, there were relatively limited strikes except right at the end of his second term. Then under Obama, it spikes up hugely. So it was really President Obama who hammed it up very dramatically. You can see the estimated total number of casualties is up to almost as high as 3,000 on the outer bounds. Myself and my colleagues at New America have been doing this for about a decade. We felt that there was some data out there, print media stories that we could assemble and sort of say, "What's going on? Who's being killed? How many strikes are there?" And so we-we began to kind of collate all this. [Martin] When it came to the Predator, we also had our forces somewhere in the area. So there would be a shot, and then people were gonna move in to do the sensitive site collection, and then-- so, you know, it was very human because you knew who were down there. [Bergen] Afghanistan, I think, was the early laboratory of what this more paramilitary CIA became, so a drone program that went from surveillance drones to actually killing people. I would say, actually, the principal reason the CIA is in Afghanistan is, in a way, the drone program, because after 9/11, al-Qaeda didn't remain in Afghanistan. They fled into Pakistan, uh, and the Taliban regrouped there. [Martin] If I'm trying to deploy six or 12 men trying to climb up a mountain and get this guy when I can do this easier and save our men and women's lives and-- I'll go--I'll take the Predator any day, any day. ♪♪♪ [Constable] In the early years and really even through, I would say, for the first ten years, you could travel anywhere.

He always wanted me to-to get education... ...so I joined the university. [Sedney] The vision for people here is not a sixth-century fundamentalist Islamic state. It's a 21st-century advanced country, and they want to get there. ♪♪♪ We can play a role in that, in helping them achieve their dreams. My father never want me to come to this university because of the risks involved with the name "American" on it, and seeing the situation, how badly the war is going on in Afghanistan, he never wanted me to come here. But I told him I have goals in my life, and I've already did good in my high school, and I had passion to get an education. [Musazai] I was not worried about security. I had heard about explosions on news, but I had not experienced something like that. [Constable] As the Taliban insurgency became stronger, there was this growing pattern of attacks that began to make everybody realize that the Taliban really were back and really were causing trouble and really were starting to put the brakes on progress of different kinds. Many evenings, I would go to my favorite bar, this Lebanese café, and I used to go there probably at least once a week for many, many years. When you live and work in a war zone, you need a place like that. You need someplace you can go and really feel yourself, be yourself, and that's pretty much the only place I felt that way. And then the Taliban attacked that café, shot dead everyone in it, including the owner. [woman] The scenes of this restaurant are really quite incredible-- people crouched on top of one-one-one another, underneath tables, gunned down inside there. So that seems to have been what has happened. Anybody who was injured seems to have been likely to have been outside the restaurant, potentially in cars waiting outside or about to enter the restaurant. Anybody inside seems unlikely to have been able to escape easily from the gunmen. That's the moment I sort of thought, "What's left here, you know? Why are we even here?" I remember feeling it. I remember thinking that. ♪♪♪ [Maddox] When I had a temporary assignment in Afghanistan, I could electrically feel the dangers around me. There we go. I've definitely known people that have died. - You want milk? - No. [Maddox, voice breaking] The night before I left, I was sitting with my younger daughter, and she gave me this bracelet that she made, and I promised her I'd wear it every day and every night that I was away, and I did. [sighs] I never took it off. And when I would leave the wire or go to the less safe or secure and fortified areas... I looked down at that bracelet, and I would definitely question what I was doing. "Am I a responsible mom? Does my work here really make a difference in this seemingly endless war?" ♪♪♪ I managed analytic teams that covered Afghan politics and Afghan economics. At that time, there was a U.S.-military narrative that things were getting better in the country and that the Taliban was failing, and that was leading to the discussions of drawdown. [Obama] Two thousand fourteen, we have agreed that this is the year we will conclude our combat mission in Afghanistan. But things on the ground were evolving and telling a little bit of a different story. The 2015 takeover of Kunduz, that's the first provincial capital the Taliban had taken since before 2001. It was a big deal. [mortar fires] [man] The battle for Kunduz started before dawn, as Afghan government troops tried in vain to hold back the advance of the Taliban. After the West's trillion-dollar war against the Taliban, its fighters still pose a potent threat. [Maddox] They took over the city for about two weeks. They released a lot of prisoners-- a lot of them were Taliban fighters-- and displaced tens of thousands of people in the process. It was a total propaganda win for them. [translator] God willing, this is our hope, to build a religious school, to build a bridge, a road, a sharia-based government. This is why we came out, and this is what we fought for-- so that sharia law is enforced here. Just holding the city-- that's all they needed to do was just take it and hold it, show of force to show their fighters and the world that they were there and still capable-- was quite significant. ♪♪♪ [Gossman] What happened in Kunduz caught people off guard when the Taliban actually managed to gain control of the city, and I think what happened then was a kind of panic. The psychological blow and the PR repercussions of having lost a very important northern city were enormous, and so then there was a kind of real scrambling to-to regain control, and the American military made a really horrific error. [man] Breaking news overnight-- U.S. warplanes may have killed nine local staffers at a medical clinic run by Doctors Without Borders. The attack was in the provincial city of Kunduz. The U.S. apparently was trying to dislodge Taliban insurgents who had seized the city on Monday. [Gossman] An American gunship targeted the hospital and circled it and hit it repeatedly. What's concerning, maybe, about how it unfolded was that the Afghan forces operating there had raided the hospital some point previously, looking for wounded Taliban, and were apparently quite unhappy with the fact that MSF treated wounded Taliban in the facility, whereas MSF, like any medical-care provider, say that they treat anyone, regardless of political affiliation. [man] Our staff have reported that there were no armed combatants or active fighting in or from the compound prior to the air strike. [translator] Doctors were about to take me to an operating theater when the bomb hit. There were flames all around me. I saw patients and doctors burn to death. ♪♪♪ [Gossman] Forty-three people died, quite a number of them staff and patients... including patients on the operating table at the time, including children. I mean, it was just horrific. ♪♪♪ And some of these forces that have carried out these raids on medical facilities are the ones we identified as being backed by, trained, recruited by the American CIA. ♪♪♪ That hospital bombing after the siege of Kunduz was pretty devastating. A lot of innocent civilians were killed, and war is war, and you can always say that, but when innocent lives are lost, it really does make it difficult to continue the work. I saw a lot of horrific images, and it's hard to deal with that and learn how to process that, but I learned and found a way to... store those images and those experiences in my heart without it destroying me. You wake up in the morning, and you brush it off, and there's always an emergency and something pressing that's happening, and you don't have time to necessarily process during the day, so you just...you just go 150 miles per hour. You go until you crash again. [Sedney] It was seven o'clock at night when the most number of students and faculty and staff were here, and it was just when people were going to their last class of the day. The attackers loose off a couple of volleys. One of them goes this way and heads towards our escape route. Another one goes in here to our main classroom building. At that time, this-these doors were open. We didn't have the-the heavy doors we have on them now. It was, uh, the month of August in 2016, and I was expecting that it's my last semester. I was done with my classes, and I went to offer the evening prayer, and we were about to leave the mosque. I heard some people shouting. My friend immediately closed the door, and she said-- she-she calls me Bresh-- and she said, "Bresh, why is there gunshots?"

If we can save a life, is it worth having a news outlet?" ♪♪♪ For the Taliban, their ideology is so important for them, and the values that we push, whether it's women's rights and so forth, goes very much against what they believe in. But also, I think that we represent the new Afghanistan because the country has moved on, and for them, it's difficult to accept that. [Semple] I take some hope from the fact that now Afghans on both sides of the conflict, they're incredibly tired of this war. They're not baying for blood. They want to see an end to it. With people I trust amongst the Taliban, we're involved in a collective effort to make sense about what's going on inside their own movement, about what's going on in Kabul and amongst the-the-- you know, the non-Taliban Afghans, and making sense of what the United States is doing. speaking native language United States had a very difficult time, almost from the beginning of the Afghan War, deciding whether the Taliban was an enemy of the United States. Are they a threat to the United States? Well, they're a threat to our ally in Afghanistan, but no Taliban, uh, has declared an intention to strike the United States, certainly not in an official way. In fact, they say the opposite-- "We're only fighting you because you're here in our country. If you get out of our country, we'll leave you alone." [Schroen] Right now the Taliban, they don't like ISIS any more than we do, so there's a war going on there while the Taliban still blow up people in-in Kabul and around the country. [Martin] I do think, at this point, the Taliban may have learned their lesson about harboring al-Qaeda. Now, why they're after Americans now? Because they're in Afghanistan. We're there. And for the Taliban and for- for Afghanistan in general, the way to communicate is, you hurt them till they leave. They did it to the Russians, you know, and-and they're doing it to us. [man] An American soldier is dead tonight after a Taliban car bomb exploded in Kabul, Afghanistan. Ten civilians and a military soldier from Romania also killed in that attack, which comes as the U.S. tries to finalize a peace deal. [Waldman] I'm really interested in that whole incident, partly because there was a video someone took right when it happened, and there's an Afghan man who-- I think he sees the truck or van kind of coming on to the sidewalk, and you can see he knows, and he starts to run, and then he dies when it blows up. That video went really viral, and it was such a sad story 'cause it was-- I think he was a shopkeeper, and he usually sent his assistant to do something but decided that day to give his assistant a break and he would go do it. I can't remember the exact story, but something about that moment and people seeing him kind of know what's coming and try to escape, I think every Afghan saw themselves in that, and that's why people just kept watching it over and over and over, but that is what life has become, you know? You're just waiting or hoping you can outrun whatever's coming. ♪♪♪ [Trump] We're like policemen. We're not fighting a war. If we wanted to fight a war in Afghanistan and win it, I could win that war in a week. I just don't want to kill ten million people. Does that make sense to you? I don't want to kill ten million people. I have plans on Afghanistan that if I wanted to win that war, Afghanistan would be wiped off the face of the Earth. It would be gone. It would be over in-- literally in ten days, and I don't want to do-- I don't want to go that route. United States does not owe us anything. They can pull out any second they wish, but what will be the interpretation of this pullout? There will be, whether you like it or not, a domino effect. This will be celebration for terrorists.

[Maddox] Seeing what we've seen in Afghanistan and our involvement in it, being our longest-running war, the theory is kind of panning out. I don't see how this war can be won. A bombshell series of investigative reports in The Washington Post exposing heartbreaking truths about the U.S. war in Afghanistan, which has claimed some 2,400 U.S. lives and cost nearly a trillion dollars. [Whitlock] The first thing we did, the first story was just to show that disconnect between what they were saying in public and what they were saying privately, but then, as you pointed out, we-we focus on certain themes, certain core failings of the war. That's the gist of-of the series. A new report claims that the American people were misled about the War in Afghanistan. A Washington Post investigation looked at nearly 2,000 pages of internal government documents and found that senior U.S. officials did not tell the truth. [Fallis] "Built to Fail. Despite vows the U.S. wouldn't get mired in nation building, it has wasted billions doing just that." Uh, "Consumed by Corruption. The U.S. flooded the country with money and then turned a blind eye to the graft it fueled." "Unguarded Nation. Afghan security forces, despite years of training, were dogged by incompetence and corruption." And the last day, uh, "Overwhelmed by Opium. The U.S. war on drugs in Afghanistan has imploded at nearly every turn." [Whitlock] I think the main headline is that, you know, for 18 years, U.S. government, generals, ambassadors, diplomats were giving rosy pronouncements about the War in Afghanistan, even though they knew the war was not going well or it was failing or that they had profound doubts about the strategy. So, in public, they were saying one thing about how they were making progress and this was a war worth fighting. In private, they admitted they had no idea what they were doing. [man] "We didn't know what we were doing," said now-retired Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, who was the Afghan war czar for Presidents Bush and Obama. I can't think of another war where you have the generals in charge of it admitting that their strategy was fatally flawed, and to say that in such raw terms, it's not just news, it's-it's history. [man] We simply didn't know what we were doing. It wasn't even mission creep. It was mission fantasy. How do we ever believe in our military people in the future?

Any commitments from the Taliban to protect the civil rights of people they so brutally repressed when last in power, particularly women. [Saleh] Afghanistan has suffered for 40 years, so it's very hard to see how this country is going to be able to pull together.
