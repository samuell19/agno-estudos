The subject's name is John Kramer, a 52-year-old male Caucasian. He's seen better days. We have a recent rectangular transection to the left occipital lobe. Some kind of backdoor brain surgery. Let's check the stomach. What the hell? Get homicide here, now. Where is it? It was in his stomach. Cut it out. Are you there, Detective? If so, you are probably the last man standing. Now perhaps you will succeed where the others have failed. You think you will walk away untested? I promise that my work will continue. You think it's over just because I'm dead? It's not over. The games have just begun. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? My eyes! What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck is this? Who's that? Talk to me. What are you doing? Talk to me. Talk to me. Stop it! Stop. Stop it. What are you doing to me? What did I do? Help! Help! Who's doing this to me? Just get away from me! What did I do? Right side clear. Left side clear. Clear. In position. Standing by. Hold right there. I see movement. We have a device. You get eyes in there before you go in. Get some eyes in here. Moving now. The doorway is clear. It's Kerry! Rigg! Don't do it! We're not secure! Rigg, I said no! Kerry! Stop him! Do not go through that door. Kerry! Shit. Get me the coroner's office. Copy. Somebody get those rats off her. Let's get the light on this. Cut her down. You know I can't do that. I said cut her down. Please. Are you trying to get yourself killed? You know never to go through an unsecured door, ever. I thought she was still alive, thought I could save her. Did you ever think that we would end up here when we first started? No. I didn't see it happening like this. Why the hell do we still do it? It's in our nature to save them. It's what we do. Right. "Cherish Your Life." What? The fucking motto. We're supposed to cherish our lives. How the hell are we supposed to do that when this is our life? We chose this. You go home. Hoffman, there are two agents here to see you. Copy. Detective Hoffman? Yes. I'm special agent Lindsey Perez. This is special agent Peter Strahm. How can I help the FBI? We're here about Detective Kerry. She was our liaison. "Open the door and you will find me." What? What's this? The key that came with out last message from Detective Kerry. "Open the door and you will find me" mean anything to you? No. Where's the body? The crime scene photographer's flash picked up this bullet casing. It was lodged between the body and the device. Run it for prints. Give us the room for a minute, would you? Thanks. The lock was open. She couldn't get out. It was constructed for her execution. Betrayed the rules. Not a Jigsaw trap then? No, Amanda Young, the accomplice... This wasn't done by Amanda Young. Excuse me? Detective Kerry weighed approximately 130 lbs. Amanda Young's arrest report has her at 107. She couldn't get her up there alone. John Kramer was... The bedridden cancer patient? He's brains, not brawn. He was also an engineer. He could have rigged pulleys... Or someone else could have helped him. Special agent, if you're here for any other reason than just to assist... We're here to find the person your department couldn't, Detective, the one helping Jigsaw and Amanda Young. Excuse me. We found a harlequin doll in your possession. What's that about? It's a toy. The kids play with toys. That's all it is. How about the tricycle? The tricycle is from John's youth. A grown man has a tricycle his whole life? I'm sure you've kept things that were important to you. Look, Ms. Tuck, is there any reason we should be concerned for your safety? Perhaps you should be more concerned for yourself. Why don't you tell me everything you know about John? And let's start at the beginning. John's life defies chronology and linear description. So why don't we start at the end and work our way backwards? I represent Ms. Tuck. She knows something. I thought you were going home. You have vacation time, right? Take it. Finish the remodeling, spend some time with Tracy. She understands. Then don't take her for granted. Eric is still out there, man. Eric's been missing for six months. Kerry was gone for four days. I can only be as optimistic as the facts allow. Yeah, well, I'm in it till I find him. Finding his body is not gonna vindicate us. Finding him alive will. It's time to let go. I want you to go home. I'll call you later to make sure everything is okay. Who's he? Lieutenant Rigg, our SWAT commander. What's his problem? Everyone around him keeps dying. What's it say? It says, "I tried calling you four times." It says, "Dinner is in the fridge." And at the bottom it says, "I love you." I need to help my mom for a few days. Just... come with me, okay? Now. I can't. You can, but you won't. What you can't do is save everyone. Tracy. Tracy, please listen to me. John Kramer owned a company called The Urban Renewal Group. No irony in that, huh? What was Rigg watching? Jill Tuck's interrogation. She was Jigsaw's ex. It's old. Why is a SWAT guy watching that? Strahm, I really think we should tell Hoffman what Detective Kerry said in her last message. She said two officers might be in danger, but until we know who, we're not causing a panic. If Detective Hoffman or anyone else in this precinct is in danger, I think they should know it. Not your call. Making any progress? We're fine, thanks. Hey, boss, looks like another doctor went missing from the hospital. Maybe it's... Thanks. I'll check it out. If you need me, call my cell. Coffee machine is around the corner. A boy or a girl? A girl. I didn't know you were married. I'm not. It's a short story, believe me. Tracy. Tracy? Hello, Officer Rigg. Welcome to your rebirth. Fuck. For years you've stood by and witnessed as your colleagues have fallen. You have remained untouched while Eric Matthews has disappeared. But with your survival came your obsession... obsession to stop those around you from making the wrong choices, thus preventing you from making the right ones. You wanted to save everyone. Tonight I give you the opportunity to face your obsession. Look closely. Eric Matthews is still alive. Eric. The block of ice he stands upon is melting. He has but 90 minutes to save himself. Detective Hoffman's fate is linked to Eric's survival. Heed my warning, Officer Rigg. Their lives hang in the balance of your obsession. Will you learn how to let go and truly save them? The choice is yours. Don't fucking move. Jesus. Take off the mask. Put your hands in the air. I can't! Officer Rigg, your first test. The person in front of you is in desperate need of help. But it is not your job to save them. You view this person as a victim. But if you want to see what I see, beneath the mask lies a criminal undeserving of the life she leads. Your obsession tells you to save the victim. I tell you to walk away. The choice is yours. Are you a cop? What? Are you a cop? Yeah, I'm a cop. What is that? What did you do? They're in the gears. What's in the gears? The combination. Get me out. Cut my hair. Just get me out. Cut my hair. Relax, relax. Hurry! Fucking cut my hair, please. Get me out! Please. Where are you going? Wait wait wait wait. Wait wait. Shit. Wait! Stop! Fucking let me out! Get back here, you fucking...! Okay, I'm sorry. Please come back. Where the hell is the combination? Shit. Shit. Hold on! Hold on! I got one. I got one. Hold on! Hold on. Hurry! Oh, God. Yeah? We pulled a print off that casing. We've got a match. Jesus. Did you check this? Twice. Come on, come on, come on. I got another one. Hold on! Hold on. Hold on. Hurry! I got it. 617. 617. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Go! Shit. Okay okay okay, listen, stay here. Don't touch anything. What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? Drop the fucking knife! Please. Put the knife down. Put the knife down. I just saved your fucking life. I'm gonna kill you! Drop the knife. Hey, these prints just came in. They're from Officer Rigg. Fisk. Not now. We just got a call of "shots fired" from 23 Park Place. That's Rigg's apartment. Hello, Brenda. I want to play a game. An officer will try to save you. If he is successful, then your game begins. This man will use these photos to sentence you for your crimes. And the only way to stop him is taped underneath the TV. Let him save your life and accept your fate to rot in prison, or kill him and guarantee your freedom. Make your choice. I'll fucking kill you, you fucking bitch! Rigg! Rigg, you in here? Rigg! Go! Move move move! Christ. I got one. I got one. It's started. An APB has been issued for Rigg. Everybody's looking. He has a wife. Where is she? We haven't located her yet. Strahm... two detectives. You see this? Hoffman... you got a 20 on him? Not yet. Hoffman. Calling. How do you explain Detective Matthews? He's alive. Six months. Jigsaw never kept anyone that long. No one but Amanda Young. You think he's been fixed? Why these six? Hoffman's a decorated lieutenant. He doesn't fit the profile. That's what you see. But what does he see? Rigg trying to save his two friends. Maybe. You got names and locations on any of these people? Working it. This is overkill. It's a setup to announce Rigg is the accomplice. Or a setup for his alibi. Everyone around him keeps dying. Where is he to tell us he's innocent or what the hell these photos are doing in his apartment? Look there. Move, please. "Four Walls Build a Home." What does he want us to see on these walls? The victims? One of these pictures doesn't belong. This is who we're looking for. Let's talk to her, now. Jill Tuck... where is she? Have them turn off the air in there. Ms. Tuck, I'm special agent Perez. This is special agent Strahm. I'd like to apologize for pulling you out of your place of work. What more do you think I can offer you? My 100 hours of interrogation tapes and the volumes of evidence taken from my house weren't enough for you to understand John? Actually, it's not John we want to talk about, Ms. Tuck. It's you. Me? Why do you want to talk about me? This isn't about me. So stop wasting both of our time and get to the real reason why you've brought me here. Hey, you. Let me go! Hey! You hear me? You fucking hear me, you fucking motherfucker? Who's my girl? What the fuck are you looking at? Huh? What the fuck...? Hey, you! Sir, sir, sir, can I help you? Hello, Officer Rigg. In order for you to fully understand my way, you must... feel what I feel. The photo before you is of a man in desperate need of help. Sir? In the next room are the tools to his salvation. His life is in your hands. But in the end only he can save himself. Be careful. There are cameras watching... and you must hide your identity. Make your choice. Sir? What the fuck's he doing? I don't know. You're gonna have to... Look, look, you're gonna have to go. People are trying to sleep. Yeah, I know people are trying to sleep. You're the one... Yeah, you can't sleep here. You have to go. Yeah, well, you can't sleep in here, okay? That's not a bed. No, you've got to go. No, you can't use the bathroom. Look, look, no. You're gonna have to go. All right... Chance, here, girl. Chance. Chance. Chance. What are you doing? Come on. Chance. Chance, come here. Come here. What you got there, huh? What you got? Come here. Come here. What do you got there? Okay, "Four walls build a home." Care to shed any light on that? Light on what? On what your photos are doing at the crime scene. "Four walls build a home" ring any bells? "Cherish your life"? "Cherish your life" is the concept that this whole clinic was built on... cherish your life... your life. That's his motto. No, it's your motto... of the clinic you run. Fuck, man. I've been here for three fucking hours! Shut the fuck up. You shut up. Are you out of your fucking mind? Hey hey. Hey, guys, come on. Calm down. Cecil! Stop it, Gus. Knock it off now, please! You don't want to do that. What the fuck is your problem? You're my problem. You're becoming everybody else's too. How do you feel about a husband who takes a motto from your drug clinic, designed to help people, and twists it into some manic torture mantra? That part of John has nothing to do with me. Look, Ms. Tuck, I just left a room with more blood on the walls than paint. Two officers are missing and there's a growing pile of bodies in their wake. And every detail we unearth about your Hall of Fame psychopath husband... Ex. points to you as a possible accomplice. I am just curious as to why. You know, there's a lot of people out there looking for answers, wanting to place blame on someone. That person is you. But you know what the best part is? I don't have to convince everybody. Just 12 people. Okay, tell me about his workshop. Stay there. Let me get the lights. Wow, it's big. This is exactly what you've been looking for. Nice, huh? Ta-da! This is the clock? What's so special about it? Except for the fact the whole deal hung on it? The mechanism inside it. It's 300 years old. Still ticking. Withstood the test of time. Wait till you see this space. I've got a surprise for you. Why are you doing this? Why? This was... this was a mistake. It happened a long time ago. And I paid for this. Just let me... just let me go, okay? What's behind that door? "One saves a life. One takes it away." Try that on the door. Try that. Oh, no no. Get back. Get back. Get back. Let's go. Go. Eric. Jesus. Help! Help me! Get away from there. What do you know about the guy on TV? What do you know about Eric Matthews? I don't know who that is. What the fuck is this? I don't know. What are you gonna do to me? If you are playing this tape, then you are one step closer to truly understanding how to save a life. As an officer of the law, you find yourself torn... Who is that? Shut up. Is the man before you a victim or a perpetrator of violence? You sick fuck. His salvation is out of your hands. It is your choice, if you wish, to put it into his own. Once this lesson is learned, you will find yourself one step closer to truly saving Eric Matthews. Without you this man's game cannot begin. Force him into position to face his demons and let him make the decision. Shh. Don't wake up our neighbors. Fuck. Is this what you do with your spare time, huh? No. Take it all, little girl. Be a good little whore. Get on the fucking bed. Get on the bed! Move! Strap yourself in. Strap yourself in. Please don't make me do this. I know... I know I was wrong. I know. Hurry up. Hurry up. Put your fucking hands up. I don't know. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, I'm really sorry. What does that say? What does that say? What is that? Take them. Why? Hello, lvan. As a voyeur, you've kept photos of those you have victimized. Let me go! Can you see the pain you have brought them? You have torn apart their lives. You have used your body as an instrument of abuse. Now I give you the chance to decide what is more important... your eyes which have led you blindly astray or your body which has caused those around you endless suffering. You have been handed the tools which can save your life. Decide quickly, though. In 60 seconds the choice will be made for you. I can do it. One more. I can do it. You're gonna have to tell me how you got those bruises on your hand and your neck. Was this an accident or did someone do this to you on purpose? You can stop it from happening if you tell me the truth. Take a seat, please. I want to go home now. The son of a bitch is lying. He's done this before. She's allowing it. The child's story doesn't corroborate. What can I do? Jane, I can't let you go home right now, okay? Go back to class, honey. I told you, Officers, sometimes these kids... they just get out of control. Get your hands off me! Hey, take it easy. Rigg! Rigg! No. Get out. Get out now. You just made the biggest mistake of your life. You hear me? I will take him for everything he's got, that fucking cocksucker. That's sweet, Ms. Tuck, but if you love the guy so much, why leave him? He left me long before I left him. Okay, people break up. Relationships end. It's called life. I mean, he started massacring people. Gideon meant everything to him. Gideon? I'm sorry, who? Do you know anything about the Chinese zodiac? Aw, Jill, no no. I didn't just get pregnant. It was carefully planned. Everything with John was. Thanks. See you. Bye-bye. Bye. Let me get that for you. Thank you. Thanks. Have a good night. You too. Good night. Good night. Hey, honey, you want some company? What are you doing? You know what this building is? It's a health clinic. You're a beautiful girl. Go home. My jacket. I forgot my jacket. I forgot my jacket. Cecil, no. Oh, please please, Jill. It's right there. Look, it's right there. Please please. Come on. Thank you. Thanks. Listen to me. I don't want to hurt you, all right? You're gonna open up that fucking door. Open that fucking door. Open it. Open it. Fuck! What fucking key? What key? That one. Fuck. Fucking stay there. Cecil? Don't cry. No no, hey, you're gonna be okay. Fuck. I need some help here. Orderly. This is my wife. She's pregnant. How far along is she, sir? Seven months. All I wanted to do was help them. You can't help them. They have to help themselves. Okay, let's review: Girl loves boy. Boy loves girl. Boy gets girl pregnant. Girl loses baby. Boy turns into a serial killer. Jill, I'm not buying it. You're gonna want to take a look at this. All right, she doesn't leave. He's been identified as lvan Landsness. Acquitted of rape three times. Had to gouge out his own eyes in order to release himself. How does something like this get into a motel room undetected? Piece by piece. The room's been rented for the past six days to a lawyer named Art Blank. Get this: He went missing two weeks ago. Run his name. Get his addresses. Two out of five people on Officer Rigg's apartment walls are dead. Every partner he's ever worked with... dead. Rigg didn't kill lvan. Ivan made his own choice. Isn't that the whole Jigsaw mantra? This wasn't about lvan. It wasn't his test. It was about Rigg. Look at these photos. Tell me how you feel. Look at these women and tell me how you feel. Angry. Enraged. Exactly. The pimp, the rapist... Jigsaw wanted Rigg to see what he sees. He wants him to feel what he feels. This wasn't about Rigg saving his friends. He's being recruited. Thanks. Art Blank's got a bunch of properties. Last known address is a couple of blocks from here. Right side clear. Left side clear. Clear. Clear. Clear. What does this mean? We're the two Jigsaw targets. Fuck you. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, asshole, you jump off that block, you electrocute him. If that ice had melted more, he'd be fried. You understand? Listen to him. You just made the biggest mistake of your life, cocksucker! Calm down. We'll get somebody to take a look at it, all right? My client has a broken nose and a fractured cheekbone. Administrative leave with pay is not acceptable. The IA investigation is underway. Into this precinct? Wow. What's that gonna get me, huh? The truth. I'll tell you what the truth is. The truth is, I have an eyewitness. The man's wife? She stands to gain as much as he does if there were to be a financial settlement, which is not gonna happen because he's lying. He attacked Officer Rigg first. That's according to whom? Me. I saw the whole thing. You want to testify before the grand jury? I've already signed IA's affidavit. The charges are being dismissed. Oh, you guys are... you're good. You know, you're obviously as thick as thieves in this precinct. But it'll come back to you. You know that, right? I mean, one day someday it will. It will come back to you. You understand? Motherfucker. Hey, do you understand? Okay. Motherfucker. You're gonna have to tell me how you got those bruises on your hand and your neck. Rigg! Rigg! I did it! I won! What the hell did you do? I... What's happening? The human body is a fascinating organism. It can withstand the most brutal injury... and yet repair itself miraculously. But you know this all too well. How many broken bones have you suffered at the hands of your husband? How many flesh wounds have you endured? Help! With time, the bruises have healed, but your pain has not. Today I empower you to take control of your life. Can you disconnect from the one thing that has brought you and others so much pain? With time your wounds will heal. His, however, will not. Remove the ties that bind... Get me out of here! Or bleed to death from you inactivity. The choice is yours. Okay. Okay okay! Here we go. I'm sorry. Morgan, Morgan, what the fuck are you doing? Help me. Please help me. I can't do this. Please help me! Calm down. No, don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Wait for me. Please get me out. Please get me out. Don't. Don't go. Don't leave me here. Help me down. Hello, Officer Rigg. What have you learned thus far? Experience is a harsh teacher. First comes the test. Second comes the lesson. If you are to save as I save then you will see that the person before you is but a student. So I ask you, Officer Rigg, has the pupil learned her lesson? Has she been taught the error of her ways? Does she now view the world differently? Please help. Officer Rigg, the key to this person's freedom lies in the palm of your hand. But only after she has done her own part can you play your role in her salvation. Once judgment has been made, though, the key to finding your next destination is just off the map. Who did this to you? I don't know. Help, please. Help, please. Stay still. I'm gonna try to take this out. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, fuck. That's it. "Just off the map." Just off the map. Tracy. "Go home." Where is she? I'm so cold. Please. I want to live. You have to save yourself. Don't leave me. Please don't leave. Help me, please. Don't leave. I want to stop playing. Why don't you fucking kill me? No. Shut up! I don't want to play anymore. "Save as I save." So what did he do, free her and let him die? This guy didn't have a chance. He's got rods going through every major artery in his body. "Your life is in her hands." Rigg didn't kill this guy. His wife did. She identified Officer Rigg, said he saved her. Saved? Yeah. She passed Rigg's judgment, got fixed and got her freedom back. Yeah. Second address? Really? Okay, yeah. That's good. Good. But I still need that address. Text me. I just found out something interesting about the three people in the traps. They were all represented by a lawyer named Art Blank. He got them all off? Yeah. But wait, it gets better. He's also Jill Tuck's lawyer. Look out! The lair... where's the lair? Raided. It doesn't exist. Jigsaw wanted us to find that place. Where's the new game being played? We find that place... we find Rigg. We got a second address. There's a co-owner. Who? Jill Tuck. Jill Tuck? Where's the building? Here. This building. Hello, Agent Perez. And welcome to the world that you have long studied. Your partner Agent Strahm will soon take the life of an innocent man. Heed my warning, Agent Perez. Your next move is critical. Open the door... What is that? I got you. Paramedics! Help! Stay with me. Okay, come on. Shallow breaths. Come on. Stay with me. All right. All right. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. Hey. Hey, you. Come here. Look. Hey. Hey. Come on. Hey. Hey. Fuck. Stop. Stop. Son of a bitch! Fuck. Stop. Fuck. Hey. Listen to me. I'm not the one you've got to worry about. You understand me? I'm not the one you've got to worry about, asshole. As a matter of fact, I recommend you stay alive until the fucking clock counts down. Here's the good news: If this other guy passes his test, the three of us can go free. Hey, look at me. Look at me. If you don't stay on the block, your partner gets electrocuted. Now for my final task. There you go. Live or die. You make the choice. Mrs. Perez? Hi. This is Peter Strahm. I work with your daughter Lindsay. Yeah. I have some bad news. See that, Jill? That's a federal fucking indictment. It's got your name on it. Wanna put somebody else's name on it? You start talking to me, okay? What's with the doll? What's with the tricycle? Who were John's business associates before he went insane? He wasn't the associate type. Where the hell is Art Blank? Obstruction of justice. Aiding and abetting. Conspirator to murder. Talk to me! In 15 minutes, more people are gonna die, Jill... police officers. He's a business partner. He's a friend. He's the accomplice we have been looking for and he is your fucking lawyer. You see this? This is my partner's blood. She's fighting for her life right now because of your lunatic husband. What happened between Jigsaw and Art Blank? John? John. I guess he's not here either. What the fuck is this place, Jill? Don't be mad. What? Hey, are you all right? You weren't returning my calls, buddy. Listen, John, I... I'm sorry. I understand. What happened was a tragedy. But I gotta tell you... listen, John, I gotta tell you, those buildings we're working on... You take 'em. You give my share to Jill. That's not the way it works, John. You see, we're partners. Your designs will make those buildings special. We've got 40 families ready to move in... 40 families, John, low-income families. You can't just walk away. You're their savior, John. Get the fuck out of here. Who are you talking to like that? It's me, John. Did you hear what I said? Oh, I heard you, John. Get the fuck... You heard me. Okay, John. You take good care of yourself. Gimme a call when you're feeling better. He blamed me. I don't think he could ever forgive me. In his mind our time was over. He was diagnosed with cancer soon after that. Did you try to contact him again? I tried. But a different person crawled out of the wreckage. Someone else survived. I asked you not to come here. I need to talk to you. John, John, look at this. What is this, hmm? Why do you have Cecil's picture? What have you done to him? I told him not to take life for granted. I want to play a game. Your life is a lie. Now comes your moment of truth. As a drug user and a hustler, you've played roulette with other people's lives. Today you play with your own. Fuck. Fuck! Hey, it's you. You did this to me. No, you did this to yourself. Your greed took the life of an innocent child. Could you give me time to explain, please? I can't give you time. No one can. Time's an illusion. Look, look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I forgive you, Cecil. I do. Addiction has ruined your life. I'm bleeding, man. Please just let me go. I could let you go. That wouldn't serve you. I'll tell you what I will do, though. I'll give you a tool to reclaim your life, to discard the vices that have so corrupted your soul. I don't have a fucking soul. Maybe you will in the next life, Cecil. You see, things aren't sequential. Good doesn't lead to good, nor bad to bad. People steal, don't get caught, live the good life. Others lie, cheat and get elected. Some people stop to help a stranded motorist and get taken out by a speeding semi. There's no accounting for it. How you play the cards you're dealt... that's all that matters. Look at me. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Oh, yeah. I understand. You're fucking nuts! Whoa! What the fuck is that? It's the tool... the tool that's going to save your life. I want to play a game. Your life is a lie, Cecil. Now comes your moment of truth. As a drug addict and a thief, you've preyed on the kindness of others to fuel your addiction. Today we're bringing the ugliness inside you out into the open. Now in order for you to stay alive we have to match your face with the ugliness of your soul. Just lean forward into the knives with your face. Press hard enough and you'll release the arm and the leg restraints that bind you. Press hard, though. And you'll be free. You sick fuck! Fuck you! Or you can sit idly and bleed out on the floor. Live or die, Cecil. Make your choice. Fuck you, you sick fuck! Help! You're dead. You're fucking dead. Fucking dead. What's happened to you? What's happened to me? What's happened to me? Now you don't come back. You do it for yourself if you can't do it for me. I lost him too. "Four Walls Build a Home." Your son was named after John's first building, right? Yes. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? What the fuck does that mean? Fuck. Oh, fuck. You'd better hope he doesn't come through that door. Who? Who's coming through the door? Who is it? Where the fuck are you? Gideon Meat Packing, 11235 Blake Drive. I don't have two minutes. Who's coming through the door? Fuck. Congratulations, Art. Who is it? Who's coming through the door? Here he comes. Who the fuck is it? Shit. Shit. Fix me, motherfucker! I'm standing right here. Your time's running out. Please think about what you're doing. Think about what you promised me. Think about tomorrow. Lynn? Lynn! Lynn! Who is it? What is that? This will release us when the timer's up. Release me! Which is it gonna be, Jeff? Live or die, Jeff. You've got a choice. I forgive you. Jeff. Jeff! Eric! Don't open the door! What the fuck? Shit. "Open the door and you will find me." Let me see your fucking hands. Where is my daughter, you mother...? Fuck. Jesus. Fuck! Aw, you stupid motherfucker. What did you do? I had more time. I still had fucking time. Why did you open that door? You fucking did this! No, you idiot. No, Jigsaw's testing you, you fucking piece of shit. Put your fucking hands where I can see them! Jigsaw's fucking testing you. Don't fucking move! Hello, Officer Rigg. If you are hearing this, then you have reached Detective Matthews and Detective Hoffman in under 90 minutes, resulting in their deaths. The rules were clear. You were warned. It's Kerry! Do not go through that door. You know never to go through an unsecured door, ever. Tonight you face your obsession. What you can't do is save everyone. Will you learn how to let go? Eric is still out there, man. It's time to let go. Detective Matthews has but 90 minutes. I recommend you stay alive until the fucking clock counts down. They had to save themselves. Take 'em. Their salvation was out of your hands. Time was on your side, but your obsession wouldn't let you wait. Instead of saving Detective Matthews, you cost him his life. You failed your final test. What I don't understand is how the hell could Jigsaw do all this? He was damn near on his deathbed the last time we saw him. I'm not so sure he did. This wasn't done by Amanda Young. Excuse me? She couldn't get her up there alone. John Kramer was... He's brains, not brawn. We're here to find the person helping Jigsaw and Amanda Young. Looks like another doctor went missing from the hospital. You go home. We chose this. Game over. You feel you now have control, don't you? You think you will walk away untested? I promise that my work will continue. That I have ensured. By hearing this tape some will assume that this is over. But I am still among you. You think it's over just because I am dead? It's not over. The games have just begun.
