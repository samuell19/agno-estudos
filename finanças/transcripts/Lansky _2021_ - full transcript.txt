Mr. Lansky, why are the American authorities after you? Well, apparently some newspaper man wrote that I had $300 million. Is it true? I wish I had a million dollars. They accuse me of making a president. Now, I don't know Mr. Nixon any more than what I've read in the newspapers. They claim I have 50% of Lebanon casinos, 50% of Monte Carlo. Now how ridiculous can we really get? Mr. Lansky, is there such a thing as organized crime? I have no knowledge on the subject. Listen Eva, I'm in Florida, honey. Daddy's here for work. What do they have here? They have oranges and gators and Mickey Mouse. Next time we can go and I promise. Okay Eva, can you put your momma on? Christie, Christie, Christie please? I know that the check bounced. Okay, but that's OK. That's why I'm in Miami. I'm going to do some book signings. Yeah, sure they gotta. They are putting me in a fancy hotel, they gonna give me the... Christie, I know my responsibilities, alright? Look Christie, I'm trying my best, alright? Trying my best. David Stone. Mr. Lansky, it's a pleasure. How was your trip? Fine, thanks, umm. Hope you don't mind, I got a coffee. You mind sitting down there? Huh, yeah sure. Thank you. Hello, Mr. Lansky, how are you? Fine, Daphne. How's your mother feel? Ah, good days and bad, you know. It is a mission. Yeah, I know all about that. What can I get for you, honey? We'll do a couple of them sandwiches. Bills sliced and fatty cut and an assortment of pickles. So, the usual. I'll pick out the best ones. OK. I'd like you to remove that. Ok. You're from Pittsburgh. You graduated on scholarship with honors from Princeton. You were on the crime beat at the Fort Wayne News Sentinel before you started writing books. You've got a wife, Christina, and two young children, Eva and Jack. I make it a point of knowing who I associate myself with. Mr. Stone, old business habits never die. It's a complicated thing, isn't it, marriage, children. I've been reading some articles about you. Forget all that. I'm here to tell you the real story. All right, well, that's great, cause I'm- I'm here to write the real story. Four packs a day, 60 years. I finally work up the courage to quit. A week later, I go to see my doctor. He tells me I'm dying. As a writer, I thought you would appreciate the irony in that. I do. I'm just I'm very sorry to hear that. My circumstances offer me the privilege to pick who I want to tell my story. Your book on Kennedy paid you well? Well, I did OK. It's been a few years since lady luck visited you. Yeah well history doesn't always repeat itself. When I was a young boy, I spent my days at the public library. I read everything and I have a particular interest in history. People see the same thing from different perspectives, and that fascinates me. But what do you want from this? Why does David still want to write a book about Meyer Lansky? Oh. Everything that I've read in history about you says you're a complicated man and maybe I like stories about complicated people. And I think that your story, the real story. I don't think he's been told yet, and I don't think it's about one man, I think it's about the 20th century. That was quite a speech, but you didn't answer the question. I need the money. Ah, there it is, the truth. When I die, the book is yours to sell. Until then, you won't show the manuscript to no one. Anything I choose to tell you is off the record until I give you permission to put it in the book. Without my approval, what you have is a work of fiction. - I won't incriminate myself. - OK. Any conversations you have about me outside of our meetings, - I want to know. - Sure. Betray me and there will be consequences. Are these terms are agreeable to you? Yes sir. I hope our collaboration will be a successful one. Hello? Hey, Christie, it's me. Hey, it's ok baby, mommy's got you. You OK? You don't sound, OK? No, I'm not. Jack's got a 103 and he's not holding his spoon down. Take him to a doctor. Excuse me? I took him to the doctor. Listen, I can't do this, OK? Not now. Christie, I gotta chance to write a new book, alright? And it could be- Oh, David, no. Could be something really good. Oh David, I called your publisher. They had no idea you were even in Miami, which means you are lying to me. I can't go through this, I've got to go. You said you read some stories about me in the papers. My reputation has a habit of preceding me. When they don't know you they put labels on you, Master Stock Manipulator. America's most successful casino operator in history. Mob's accountant. The feds even leaked the story to the press about me having $300 million squirreled away. If you find out who's out there guessing, please be sure to let me know. - Yeah. - You don't get to keep it, call me and I'll give you a piece. Fair enough. The labels are the accurate? It's your book. You decide. OK, alright. Okay. You strike me as a rather obsequious guy, David. Quick to please. Never thought of myself that way. - You're seperated. - Hmm. What did your wife think about that? Did she find you that way? We're here to talk about you. We are not here to talk about me, Mr. Lansky. No, no, no. We have to talk about you and me. - You know, I was married also. - Yeah? Yeah, twice. You know, what they say, can't live with them, can't shoot them. So where do we start? Let's start when you were a child. Russia. The only thing I remember about Russia, is one day me and my uncle crossing a path and some Cossacks ordered my uncle to open his potato sack. And toss a potato up in the air. My Uncle obeyed. Tossed a potato into the air, and the Cossack takes out this fucking sword and swoosh. He wasn't aiming for the potatoe. He was aiming for my uncle's hands, Cut it right off. Tough guys. But swords, we didn't have a sword. That was the difference. I never forgot that. I promised myself I'd never be that helpless again. The next time I'll be the one holding the knife. That's the only thing Russia ever gave me, when I swore that day. Made me stronger, it sharpened me. I wish I knew where that cocksucker was today, I'll show them what a tough guy he is. The real story starts in America. By the time I was 10, I was sharp as a shiv. My mind was my escape and more than anything, numbers. Numbers gave my world some order. And if a kid with that kind of interest in numbers, there was nothing as thrilling is a dice game. I would watch them play. But oh boy, my old man found out that was how I was spending my time, My father? Everything he did, he did for us. He was an honest man earning an honest living. There's nothing wrong with that. He wasn't living his life. His life was living him. I guess that's what we do. We measure ourselves against our fathers. And you? What was your's like? My father died when I was young. That must have been hard. So being an honest man. Being an honest father. Yeah. Is that beneath you? What I know is that life wouldn't wait for me. It all happened so fast, I put down the nickel my mother gave me to pick up some bread. In a matter of seconds, my nickel was gone. Can you imagine having to tell my mother and father why we couldn't eat that night? He took your money and you just felt ashamed. It was rage. You ever feel that, David? A rage so strong it changes the path you're on? Never felt anything like that. There are people in this world who will try to make you believe that they are better than you, that they can win at your expense. Rage is a tool we use to look those people in the eye and prove them wrong. That's what drove you to win at dice? It did much more than drive me to win. It drove me to control the game. I calculated the odds and payoffs. Watched how the probabilities ebbed and flowed, but something didn't make sense. I knew something was going on, something invisible that no one else could see. And then I saw it. A blink of the eye, a scratch of the air, I figured out what these guys were doing, they rigged the game. It was the outsider. He was the one controlling the game. And isn't that what we all want, David? The only one is in gambling, as in life, are those who control the game. I think that you have the smile of a beauty queen, right? I do know I don't think that they stick out. I don't think that there's a huge gap, but, if you think they're going to straighten out, then what's the point of getting braces, right? Mom's right. Right about what? We can't afford it. That's why you don't want me to get braces. She say that? Put your mama on, Eva? Hmm? She said she can't talk. What ya mean she can't talk? If she can't talk or she won't talk? She said she's not talking to you, daddy. Give mama a message, alright? - Can you do that? - Okay. And you tell her that the reason that Daddy's in Miami is because of a man called Meyer Lansky. Meyor Lasky? It's okay, she know who that is. And you tell her that Mr. Lansky hired daddy personally to write a book about his life. And every publisher is going to want it and it's going to be best selling when it is, daddy is gonna set your smile, alright? OK. Because that's what daddies do. Yeah? - Yeah. - OK. Don't you worry about your thing. Alright, you go tell her. I love you, daddy. Alright, bye. Sorry. You look like hell. Yeah, I didn't get much sleep. Problems at home? OK, umm. Ok, today... These problems you're having, I hope they're not interfering with your ability to work. I'm here. I'm fine. Good. I want to talk about Bugsy Siegel. It's Ben Siegel. Say that name again. Ben Siegel, Bugsy. He and Lansky had bootlegging and gambling racket known as the Bugs and Meyer Gang. There were more than partners. They were like brothers. Lansky handle the numbers. Bugsy was the muscle. All right, Ben. Come on. I think he gets to a point. The only thing Bugsy enjoyed more than killing was the ladies. Or maybe it was the other way around. Luciano is looking for somebody to run as his transportation for him. We offer Lucky a deal on his distribution too favorable to turn down. Maybe we take a loss on it. A loss? How's that makes sense? We'll be getting in on the ground up with Lucky Luciano and it will supply liquor for our own operation at the same time. Profit margins are justified tenfold. I did the math for you. Yeah, I'm sure you did. What do you think of that guy, Ramsie? He's friendly. Gets along with the clientele, why? He should lose the ring. It's distracting. Sends the wrong message. Rosen why are you so fucking happy? Our operation was expanding fast. We had to keep our books clean, keep the authorities off the money trail. If you're on a leaky boat, you plug the holes. You over by 200. It was a good day at the track. Yeah? Explain the numbers to me. Uh, I had 9,320 on the seven at... 573 against the favorite. But you heard Reenam Roll was a winner. So you, what? You to sweeten the pot? You got to admit it. He is good. Yeah, well, I couldn't lose. What did I tell you? Trust your memory. I know, I just got a lot of numbers to remember. You know, how many gambling rooms I run in this town? The fact that you don't know puts us at an advantage. You also got no idea how much money comes through that door each day, do you? You know what? The only one who knows is me and I keep that number in my head. But you do know the percentage of our bets don't you? - 10%. - 10% win or lose? That's what sustains this business, Jimmy. Is there anything else you want to tell us? Who else is gambling with our money, maybe? I swear, Bugsy, I don't know nothing. Did you just call me Bugsy. Everybody calls you that, at least when you're not around. Well, now I'm confused. Am I not standing here? What am I? Am I a figment of your imagination? No. No, no, because that's what you just said. That's what people call me when I'm not around. But I'm right here. Meyer, do you see me? I see you, Bennie. I'm going to ask you one more time, Jimmy. Is there anything else you want to tell us? - No, I... - Don't lie to me. Don't forget to breathe. They say breathing is good. Okay. Now, don't you want me to know? I-I-I may have heard something about a dealer at your Roma at Allen. I don't remember his name. Well, let me jog your memory, huh? Ow! Rosen, his name is Rosen. Now what exactly did he tell you? He was tipping off some players. I don't know anything else, I swear. Sit up. Thank you, Jimmy. It's very helpful for us, you know. Oh, at least you die with a clean conscience, right? Who? You. God dammit, not in my ear. First time me and you met and here comes little Meyer walking through the snow like the wandering Jew. And my guys, I mean, there must've been like six of us or something, huh? Seven. We ask him to empty his pockets, if he wants to cross the street, Ask? I don't recall any asking. We politely instructed him to remove the contents of his pockets. Charlie Lucky Luciano, father of modern organized crime. He created the governing body of the Mafia known as The Commission and the National Crime Syndicate, Confederation of Italian, Jewish and Irish Gangsters. And you know what he said to us? "Go fuck yourselves, you guinea bastards." That's right and the balls on this one, huh? This kid would fought all six of us before giving up a penny. So what do I do? I let them go. Kid as us fearlessness as that deserves to be rewarded. How many times I've gotta hear this story, huh, Lucky? Eh, this story is like wine, Benny. Get's better with age. I prefer whiskey. The point is. You and me, Meyer, Italian, Jew, none of that matters. What matters is the way we see the world. We fight our way in from the outside. That's right. This distribution business you proposing, we got ourselves a deal. I'll drink to that. See that half-Checz girl? You know, she's jotting everything down. Who's coming, who's going, who's talking to who? That all goes to lucky. It's the attention to detail. That's what makes a Lucky, Lucky. I'm paying attention to a different detail. Be right back. Have a seat. This is my friend, Meyer. Meyer, please meet Anne and Louise. Hello. Now tell me something, what are two lovely ladies like yourself doing in a place like this? The sign outside said it was a drugstore. I needed some toothpaste. So what are you guys, professional gamblers or something? Oh! Us? No. No, no, no. Then what line of business are you in? Truck rentals. Truck rentals? What does that mean? Means we rent trucks. Anne, look. It's the big cheese gangster from the newsreels. They say he murdered his own cousin. Louise. Hey, how's about I go over there tell them to come give you a good old kiss on the lips. Very funny. OK. What the hell? Is he really doing it? Oh, my God, he's looking right at us. Let's get out of here. I'm not going anywhere. The man is a killer and these guys are his friends. They seem harmless. Suit, yourself. So you're in the truck rental business? Cold? You need a coat. Are you going to buy me one? Fur. Mink. Leather trim down to the knees. And what will you do with the rest? Of this? This I'm going to keep for our future. Not too cold. It's refreshing. Oh, it's cold. Alright, crazy. Would you like 'em? Sure, why not. Thank you, I'm Maureen. I'm David. You're a writer. Yeah? How do you know that? I hear you taping at night? Yeah? Yeah. And the walls are pretty thin. Spy novels? I'm just doing research. On women in swimming pools? It's good you quick, very quick. What about you? Are you on vacation? Something like that. Doctor, are you telling us that Buddy will have to wear a brace the rest of his life? If you'd like, I'd be happy to recommend specialists who are developing a new treatment for cerebral palsy. Answer the goddamn question. My professional opinion is, you a... The doctor said there was no chance he would ever be normal. And you couldn't accept that? I wasn't about to let my son become weak and vulnerable. No. And if I could help it. Why did that bother you so much? Why do you think? Would it not bother you to see your own son go through his life at such a disadvantage? I couldn't accept the odds. The odds? It was a mathematical equation, the proportion of those afflicted versus those cured, the rate at which those afflicted were able to walk again. I ran the numbers to my head. I made the calculations. You thought you could beat the odds? Yes. What about faith? Faith? Mm hmm. Maybe God wanted him to be like that. Who? Hello, God, hello, hell fucking lo. I ain't hearing anybody answer me. Maybe he's got nothing he wants to tell you. And he made that clear, didn't he? You OK? Let's do this. Come on you. Shut up, Rosen.. Get down, come on, get down. Please, don't do anything to him, please! Hey, hey, woah, woah, woah, enough. Hey, what the fuck is she doing here? Well you told me to bring her down. Please, please, he's a good man. He's a father. We have four children, please. Oh God. Get up. Here, this is for you. Your husband has been stealing from me for years, Mrs. Rosen. A nickel at a time, money that adds up. Mrs. Rosen, you knew about this, didn't you? It's OK. This is a warning. But if you ever mention what you see here today to anyone. You'll be putting your life and your children's in danger. You understand? Get her out of here. May I help you with anything, Mrs. Rosen? Come on, deal with it. Don't worry about him, he's okay. Where were you? She was a mess, boss. I was trying to be delicate. Never let your emotions dictate your actions ever again. So you left them fatherless? Three children. He left them fatherless. Is that what you tell yourself, so you can sleep at night? No, I don't have to tell myself anything when I go to sleep at night. It's the way we live. It's business. What do you want, a fucking fairy tale, David? Go home and write a fairy tale. I want you to write a book about me. Would that be of interest to you? Yeah, I'd be very interested in that. Good, I'll need you to come to Miami. There's a coffee shop not far from where I live. Take down this address. Okay? We need more resources. Even after sell him Frank? 15 years. You got all the surveillance you asked for. What else are you expecting to find here? The $300 million that Lansky has stashed away. This guy, Stone, can really open the door for us. Opening the door? There are no more doors to open, Frank, tax evasion, contempt of court, they threw it all away. And no indictment. Lansky's impenetrable. But that stuff was 10 years ago. And where's he been for the last 10 years? Federal prison? No. Collins Avenue walking that little shiatsu of his up and down the boardwalk with a smug face. It's an embarrassment, frankly. We can fix that. Oh, yeah and how's that, Greg? Even if that money is out there somewhere, we don't have the budget to keep digging holes to know where to try to find it. We're talking about the most notorious gangster in American history. We're just asking for a little rope. A little rope, so you two can hang yourselves, huh? Andre. Just consider it. Hey, hey. Hi. I was, um, I was in the neighborhood. Come in, come in, yeah. So I was about to take a break, so we need some glasses. I've only got these glasses so let me fix something. One second. How is the book going? - The book? - Yeah. Uh, struggling. I'm guessing that's a good thing, you know? Is this the guy you are writing the book about? Yeah. Meyer Lansky? That's him. Here, sit down. Should I know who that is? Uh, he ran a lot of Casinos. So, if you're into gambling, I guess, but, um. Hey, I'm so sorry about the mess. Oh stop, I don't care. That's my daughter. She's really cheeky. And looks a lot like me. Oh, she's pretty cute. Yeah, and I got a picture of my son somewhere, but of 18 months. He looks like a bug. But uh, here you go, and don't worry, you know? - Yeah, I noticed. - Yeah, okay. To your huh, to a vacation in paradise. Sorry. You were saying? To umm... To a vacation in paradise, I guess. Are you sure? Yeah. Well you were unfaithful to your wife, is that why you broke up? Then what was it? I tried to give her a good life and tried to make her happy, but it wasn't enough. Happy on whose terms? Your's or her's? I was as unfaithful as they come. The way I see it, you do what you can and feel alive. It's time I told you about the years leading up to the war. I though you quit. You keep it pack as a reminder. You want to conquer your weaknesses, keep them in plain sight. Speaking of which, how was... Who? You still have lipstick on your neck. Don't you shower? Jesus. So, Lucky was in jail. I wanted to get him out of prison. How fast can we put together an army of men? Fast? For what? I want to put the fear of God into them. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. My We call upon our legislators to evict. Jew is as alien in body, mind and soul and it is more dangerous to us than all the others by reason of its parasitic nature. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. This is a private function. My name is Sasha Klein. My parents come from Ludmir, Poland. I'm Jew. You got something to say to me? Say it now. Jewish scum! I would rather have killed them all. Why? To show the world that as long as my Meyer Lansky was around, they could never do that to us, again. Never. Rabbi Weiss calls the act shameful and deplorable. The rabbi says there is no difference between these so-called Jewish gangsters and the Nazi hoodlums they attacked. Kosch refuses to take my money. People look away from me and the kids when we walk down the sidewalk. Now they all know. Paul, come. Come. Buddy, you too. Leave your father alone. He's got some thinking to do. Buddy. Listen to your mother. Mr. Lansky, I'm Lieutenant Haffenden of the P3 division of Naval Intelligence. As I'm sure you know, the Germans are sabotaging, and destroying our ships all over the North Atlantic. I've read the papers. It's terrible. The enemy is here on our shore. It's only a matter of time before there's an attack on our soil. We need to ferret out German spies. Like you, who's got a problem with the Sicilians. Because the Sicilians got a problem with people like you, the authorities. The Mafia controls the waterfront. Are you suggesting that I'm affiliated with the Mafia? I'm a businessman, Lieutenant. Of course. I'll find your spies, but you got to do me a favor first. Mr. Luciano, State Department has agreed to arrange for your release from prison. Twenty four years left on my sentence, 14 of whom even eligible for parole. Meyer. I know you would do the same thing for me. What can I do to help? They need you to set up a meeting with Joe Socks. Joe Socks, Joe Lanza, local 16975. United Seafood Workers Union. I'll arrange for your boys to get their union cards and you can begin your operation. I was the connection between the U.S. and the waterfront. There were German spies working amongst us. I extracted whatever intelligence I could from them on behalf of the feds. The fate of the country depended on us, and they're looking to lock me up? God bless America. I had my men on a dock hunting Germans up and down the shore. We root them out and have ourselves a friendly conversation in the language them cocksuckers understood only too well. You got an address? 224 Main Street. Freeze, don't move. Don't move, you're under arrest. We busted up the whole German intelligence network. Blew the cover on a group of spies moving artillery, bombs and cash. They were planning an enormous attack on American soil, but we stopped it. So, why would you defend a country whose government is devoted to putting you behind bars? I'm an American and a Jew. The Germans wanted to destroy both of those things. So I wanted to destroy the Germans. - And I did. - OK. But why? Why was it never in the in the press? They could never own up to the fact that somebody like me could be capable of doing any good in this world? See, I believe this world is made of shades of gray. It's never black or white. So, you never felt compelled to just set the record straight and say, Meyer Lansky, patriot. I think you found the title of your book. I'm asking the question. I never felt the need back then. Why? It was currency between me and the United States. I assume that if I did favors for the government, they would always honor my loyalty. And did they? We haven't gotten to that part of the story here David. OK? The United States, are not who you think they are, David. You're the wandering Jew just like Lucky said, right? That's me, the outsider invited in from the cold to warm my feet by the fire. And then sent them my way again. Yeah. You know how that feels, don't you? Of what? What? To be an outsider. Your father didn't die, David, he walked out on you and your family and you felt like an outsider ever since in this world. Yeah. Look at us here. Couple of outsiders sitting here in a diner. Don't fucking lie. That's bullshit. No. Maureen, I am gonna ask you one more fucking time, who fucking snitched? I don't fucking know. I swear on my fucking, I have no idea. - That's bullshit. - You okay? Who the fuck is that? David, please don't, we're just talking. Don't fucking lie. I swear my fucking life, I have no idea. - You're shaking. - I'm not shaky. Hey, take a hike, pal. Hey, I've got a John fucking Wayne here, huh? Let me ask you a question, John. Are you fucking her? Jesus, Ray. I don't think it is any of your business, buddy. I'll tell you why is my fucking business because she's got a big fucking mouth. - Fuck you. - And if I can't trust her, I can't trust any of her fuck buddies either. Don't disrespect her, okay? You put your fucking bag down, pal. Ray, please don't do this. Yeah, put your fucking bag- God dammit. You're a fucking asshole Ray. It's your fucking warning. Keep your mouth shut. He was busted for selling drugs. Someone set him up. I told a girlfriend of mine I was in Miami. She told him where I was. So he showed up wanting to know if I know who set him up. Do you? No. We all make mistakes. Ray was one of mine. Life is just full of shades of grey. She likes it rough, huh? Who did that to you? It's nothing. Either you're going to tell me who did this or I'm going to find out. All right, well, okay you know, the woman that I've been... Fucking? I think that's the word for it. Yeah, OK, well, I had to break up a fight between her and her ex. I see. Well, I wish you luck with all your future sparring endeavors. Thank you, nice. My pleasure. Next time hit him first. Always hit him first. Mr. Lansky, you chose the losing side. I'm a businessman, I don't choose sides. We chose opportunities. Which is why I think we can make a deal. Salvatore Maranzano, possible bosses of organized crime in New York. Bootlegging, racketeering, narcotics. He called himself Little Caesar. I want to invest in your corporate joints. See, the thing is, I built my business from the ground up and I prefer to keep it under the same roof. And frankly, Mr. Maranzano, I don't need your money. Yeah, I don't give a shit, how's that look? What if I offer you an opportunity to take Luciano's seat in the council? How you propose doing that? You take Luciano out and the seat's yours. He'll never see it coming from you. You walk out now or we'll take you down with the restaurant. I have known Luciano for a long time, since we were children. He's much more than an associate to me. I respect that. But there can only be one boss, and that's me. It's about business. I think you should make the right decision here and do the right thing. We've got a search warrant. Hey, nobody move. Nobody move! Hey! What's all the commotion? Go check it out, Marco. Woah, woah, woah, calm down. Put down your guns. My boss is inside, you go talk to him. He knows your Captain. It's going to be OK. Everything's all right. Hey. What took you so long? Lot of stairs. Double crossing prick. Make him feel it, Benny. No. - Come here. - No. Look at me, look at me when you fucking die, you double crossing sack of shit. Oh, that's it. Here you go. They're going to come after us now, all of them with everything they've got. We'll already be in control by then. I'm grateful for your loyalty, Meyer. I want a seat at the council, Charlie. It's a new era, what matters is how I run my business, not the fact that I'm a Jew. You know, if it were up to me... We'll be your executors, seen the numbers we're doing in Saratoga. No one runs an operation like I do. I got the best carpet joints, Upstate, Jersey, Florida. No, you don't gotta justify it to me, Meyer. Plus, I got the muscle to back all of 'em. And the revenue, the revenue speaks for itself. I run it like a business and Ford Motors, Coca-Cola. You know, like U.S. Steel. I'll tell you what, I'll do what I can to convince the council that you deserve a spot. Hmm. What about Benny? Benny. Benny's handling California for us? Why are you still awake? How the hell am I supposed to sleep? Do you know what time it is? Yeah, says the man who comes and goes at all hours. Mind your business. Was out working. Oh work. It's always work with you. Take a look around you. All this shit. Where do you think it comes from, huh? Maybe try showing a little gratitude for once. Gratitude? The hell with gratitude, you're a criminal. Come on. What happened to you? You're pathetic. You think the neighbors don't talk to you because of me? I see in your eyes what you do at night. Who do you think you are coming into our home pretending to be a good man, huh? A father? You think you're helping him? Shut your mouth! It's your fault. It's your fault he's a cripple. It's because of you, it's all because of you! It's called "judgement", it's punishment for what you've done and how you live your life, Meyer. God is watching. He's watching, he's watching you, I know he is. You believe that? Believe what? We get judged and punished for the way we live our lives. The choices we make that's what defines us. I don't question the choices I make. Never? I get the feeling sometimes you don't question the choices you make either. Okay, let's talk about those choices. Tell me about Murder, Inc. After Maranzano, we needed the muscle to consolidate our power. I had the right people to do it. Bingo. A group of nice Jewish and Italian boys, you know, the kind a girl wants to bring home to her mother. Always willing to lend a hand. "Murder, Inc.", that's what they called them. There was Abe "Kid Twist" Reles, "Tick-Tock" Tannenbaum, Louis "Lepke" Buchalter, an army of enforcers, hired assassins, a thousand hits between 'em, they put contract killers on payroll. There were no rules on how to kill. As long as you got it done, you got paid. Most were shot, stabbed, strangled, drowned, burned, buried alive, left to bleed dry, all of 'em unrepentant, cold-blooded killers. And Lansky was their general. Through sheer determination and fearlessness, Lansky finally got what he wanted, a seat at the table sitting right beside guys like Joe Bonnano, Frank Costello, Al Capone, Italian... - Meyer. - To Meyer. Jewish and Irish mob bosses from across America, together, they formed the largest organization of crime the world has ever known, the National Crime Syndicate. I don't know understand when they're investigating Lansky, no one bothered to look at the old files. Hey, we're talking 40 years of transcripts, depositions, surveillance reports. That's a lot of material. Frank, look at this. It says he's still alive. Mr. Sims, I'm Special Agent Frank Rivers with the FBI. I'd like to talk to you about your association with Meyer Lansky. Never heard of him. I can make your life in here a whole lot easier, you know. I'm gonna die in here. The hell are you gonna do for me? Get me fresh soup? Well, Lansky sent you on a job and you got caught and right now he's uh... he's having a pretty comfortable life, and you're stuck in here. You gonna pop him for me, are you? I can put him away. Make it so his life's not a whole lot different from yours. I'm looking for his money. He started stashing it away back in the Murder, Inc. days. So who was keeping the books back then? - No money. - What do you mean no money? There's no money in murder. It wasn't a sustainable business not like a casino. There was money. Maybe he just didn't tell you about it, he was stuffing the walls with it. Then go ask the walls. You listen to me, you piece of shit. The only reason you're in here is because of that asshole. Well, now you can suffer the rest of your time in here because of him, too. Geneva. Geneva? He had a money manager in Geneva. What are you doing with that? What are you doing with it? FBI. Just tell... just tell me, tell me. Tell me, it's okay. What... what is it? Ray turned state's evidence, he made a deal with the Feds, they reduced his sentence. And he named me as one of his partners in his drug operation. So the Feds came to me and they said that I would go to prison if I didn't cooperate. Okay. So how? It's "cooperate" that's the word that they used? Get close to you. Okay, and then? Feed them information from your files. Listen, David, everything that's been happening between us is real. - You have to trust me. - Trust you, trust you? I know that sounds ridiculous. I have a family. What did... did you... What'd you give 'em? Everything I could remember. The name of associates and accomplices. They wanted me to write everything down and give it to them and that's what I did. Okay, what else did they want? What else they wanted apart from names? They said you might have information on money that Lansky laundered years ago. Money. Oh. What are you doing with that? What are you doing with it? FBI. I'll tell you everything. Okay, here we are again. Morning. Can I help you? Special Agent Frank Rivers, with the FBI. We're looking for a guest of the hotel, Miss Duffy. She's in room 1-4-6. Miss Duffy's not here. Well, I'd like to look in her room if I could. Suit yourself. But you're not going to find anything there. - Room's empty. - Empty? Miss Duffy checked out late last night. How did you evade the Feds, like how did you and your business associates become so successful under the scrutiny of the government? - Why are you whispering? - Hmm. I can hardly hear you. How did you and your associates like that were very successful under the scrutiny of the government? How did you do that? The way any legitimate company does. We were making more money than some Fortune 500 companies. We got assets to manage and we had the best talent to manage them. You okay, David? You seem a little white around the gills this morning. It was one of those nights. Not another one. Okay, so um, how'd you go about doing all of that, changing your business practices? 'Cause I think that's what everyone wants to know. I taught my associates that there are benefits, cost benefit of keeping a guy that owes you money alive instead of goons, I said, we ought to send accountants. Additional sum for the cash reserve and profit should be passed along to be put in the credit column of the ledger. There's a reason I dropped out of school when I was 12. Let him talk. That guy made more money for Luciano than all your tweeds combined. - Come on. - Uh. Any questions? In the early days, a man owed you money, you would send goons to break his body apart, and if he couldn't pay, he'd find an unfortunate end. Now, rather than kill the guy, we ordered him, crunch the numbers, make sure his business turns a profit. Now, Joe Schmo belongs to us. We own him. Why don't we go for a walk, David? You look like you could use some air. Come. Optimizing our resources, restructuring our operations. This was a new world for our associates. I think it was Henry Ford that said that, "Business that makes nothing but money is a poor business." Gambling and casinos are to entertainment, what Ford's automobile was to transportation. For some business, it's to realize as the toss of the dice. We catered to that need. Okay, you wake up in the morning, there's car in your driveway, you didn't make a product. Henry Ford's product wasn't the car. It was the freedom the car gave to people. Freedom is what people wanted. Our product wasn't gambling or the casinos. It was the world of excitement and thrills. We built have resorts in this country, created thousands of jobs, supported families. It was a product. That's why it's all legalized now, why the government has its finger in the pie. It was too valuable a product to leave to criminals. David, where's your car? It's over there. This fucker is following us. Can you fucking believe it? See if you could turn off some place, make the first turn off you can. Here? Right over here. Son of a bitch. Right, so who is that? I thought maybe you could tell me. I... I don't know. When you lose your money, you lose nothing. When you lose your health, you lose something. When you lose your character, you lose everything. Remember that. Hey, woman in the room, you seen her? - She checked out. - She checked out? What's going on here? I don't want any trouble. I'm not giving you any trouble. The Do Not Disturb sign has been on your door for a week. Okay, well, let's keep it that way, alright? I'll pay you extra, you let no one in my room. Fine. Let's talk about the shitstorm of trouble you're in, Mr. Stone. Show him the pictures, Greg. This must have been fun, huh? Get a little taste of that. You have fun taking these? Did you have fun taking them? Meyer Lansky has over $300 million. Why are you... why are showing me this? Listen to me. Lansky has over $300 million squirreled away somewhere. The government wants it and we want your help finding it. I can't, I can't... I... Now we could let it slip to Mr. Lansky that you've been sharing his secrets with an FBI informant. That's not gonna go well for you. Look, we don't wanna go down that road if we don't have to. We know you're just a writer who was looking for a story who had the misfortune to stumble into a decades-long investigation into Lansky and Associates. So we're willing to offer you a financial incentive, we'll make you a paid informant. We'll give you $150,000. Now that'll go a long way to take care of your family - and your money problems. - I don't have any... I don't need your money. David, we've been listening. You help us or Lansky gets to you first. Now we can offer you and your family protection and the money. The way I see it, you don't have a choice. I'm gonna give you my number here. You call us from a payphone when you got something. Do the right thing here, David. You heard the joke about this rabbi who got hit by a car, falls down, the emergency ambulance comes, rabbi's laying on the floor, the emergency worker runs over, says, "Rabbi, Rabbi, are you okay?" The rabbi looks up at him and he says, "I make a living." Okay, go ahead. A little levity here, you know. Money, must have been pouring in by now, right? That's right. The gaming business in Cuba is no good, it's a free-for-all, no regulations. These men are making millions. Gambling in Cuba will soon be under our control again. And President Batista wants you to oversee it, Mr. Lansky. All of it. I appreciate the opportunity. I always felt Cuba, a land of enterprise. In America, you might be an outlaw, but in Cuba you are on the inside. You were making what, 10 million? Turned to 20, and then 30 million. I was the biggest casino operator this country had ever seen. You were legitimate, yeah, you were above board. You had your license, machines weren't rigged. Never. But they still consider you part of the underworld. We weren't the underworld. We were the overworld. Go back to sleep. When Batista gave Lansky control over Cuba's casinos, Lansky turned the country into an international playground for gamblers and pleasure-seekers. Criminal empire outside the U.S., it couldn't be touched by law enforcement. The National Crime Syndicate now owned the biggest gambling corporation in the world. And Lansky was the CEO. Hey kid. How you doin', huh? How was the trip? Fine. How you doin', beautiful? Huh? Come on, let's go. You wanna go to the room? Let's head in. Come on. You put the nickel in. Just try. Right here? Pull that lever hard. State-of-the-art slot and blend, silent bells, double jackpots and then the guys rig 'em so they better our odds. Haven't I talked to you about that? About what? I don't want the machines rigged. Every casino in this town rigs their machines. I'm not every casino. Yes, sir. Come on, go again. I'll be right back, Buddy. Keep at it. You, watch the kid. Mr. Yariv. Mr. Lansky, thank you for seeing me. Welcome to the Colonial, Mr. Yariv. Please. Thank you. How can I help you? Mr. Lansky, I'm here on behalf of Golda Meir. As you know, our people have been slaughtered in Germany and across Europe. The Jewish settlement in Palestine has been hard at work. You need money? Yes. To purchase weapons. We are fighting for the future state of Israel and for the survival of the Jewish people, Mr. Lansky. Fighting, as in killing. We will do whatever it takes, Mr. Lansky. You tell Miss Meir that she has Meyer Lansky's support. I'd be happy to contribute in any way. And I'm sure my colleagues here share my feelings for the state of Israel. Well, how much do you have on you. It's the weekend take. Give it to him. Mr. Yariv here is taking donations for the state of Israel. I am Italian. I'll make arrangements for more. On behalf of Golda Meir and the Israeli people, we are grateful. And we will not soon forget. If you need any weapons or ammunition, you let me know. We hope you enjoy your stay with us. Oh, I'm not staying at the Colonial. Next time, I hope. We're hearing things, Meyer, about Ben. What kind of things? That he's out of control, kicking heads in, dating movie stars. He's lost his focus, Meyer. We gave him California, we gave him Vegas, all's we get in return is grief. I'll talk to him. Envelopes are coming back lighter. Listen, Lucky ain't happy, Meyer. You know, it ain't easy for us coming to you like this not gonna shout Ben. I said I'll talk to him. So what are you gonna do with your winnings, huh? Buy mom a new fur coat, just like you always do. Your mother... your mother, she's got plenty of fur coats. I'm gonna be just like you. I'm gonna get my wife fur coats, too. Or you can be whatever you wanna be. You don't wanna be like me. Why? You just don't. I love you, you know that, right? I love you, too. I never wanted my children to follow in my footsteps. You know, I think about it all the time. My kids see me as a... a man who tries his best or... or some failure? It's complicated. Marriage, children, you did your best. I trust you, David. You're gonna write a hell of a book. Vegas. Vegas, Flamingo. We built that town, a paradise, but for us it turned out to be our worst nightmare. - Yeah. - Benny. Meyer, that you? What time is it? It's a quarter after 2:00 there. Look, why don't you hop on a flight and head out here? Oh, hey pal, listen, I'd love to, but you know, Ginny's got friends in town, right? So probably not for me. Hey, I gotta tell you, the women in this town, man. Meyer, you'd go crazy. I'm happy things are good for you, Ben, but unfortunately, we have to talk about something not so pleasant. Well, what is it? It's our investors. - They're not happy. - What do you mean? Is there... did they tell you that? Can you blame them? The materials are overpriced, the construction is delayed. Do you know how many people are undertaking this town? I can't screw in a light bulb without a city official and he's goddamn maid coming for a handout. - That's the deal. - The accounting is sloppy, Ben and sloppy accounting leads to concern. Do me a favor. Remind them that we own 66% of this casino, which means we get to decide who gets to be concerned. 66% of nothing is nothing. We have to put money back in to cover the cash flow problem. Were you planning on talking to me about this? Of course. Of course, I mean what'd you think I wasn't gonna have that conversation with you? How much are we talking about, Ben? Half a million. Maybe another three just to get us through a few months. I'll turn it around, Meyer. I know you will, Ben. That's what I told Lucky. I'm not gonna let you down, I swear. I know, Ben. You're listening to my calls? He's a bum. He's a bum and you know it. It's not your concern, Anne. He's gonna get you killed. They'll kill you both. Bang, bang. Goodbye, Meyer Lansky. May he rest in peace. Father. Husband. Murderer. - Stay out of this. - How about I jump, huh? Right off this balcony and save you all that trouble. Don't be ridiculous. Come on. Would make your day. Don't pretend like you care for my well-being. All you care for is your money. It's your money, money, money, money, money. - Your money. - Enough! No! You murderer, you're a murderer! Get off! Liar! Get off me! No! Hey, call an ambulance. - No, Meyer! - It's my wife. - No, Meyer. - She's hysterical. No! Meyer! Just get a doctor here now! Well, God damn. Meyer, oy. Look at this place. Nice, hmm. Are you kidding me? You're the king of the goddamn domain. I'll tell you something, too. It'll be little different down here. How's your flight? Ah, forget about that. Real question is, what do we got lined up for tonight? Hmm. Oh, boy. Things have changed, Ben. Look around you. There's too much money at stake to be fucking around. We're not kids anymore. Yeah. You're right. I can't keep defending you. Especially if you don't show any results. Is that what you doin'? You're defending me? Meyer I used to know, he would've stood up for his pal. You know, there was never an option for me. Wasn't gonna be a tailor's son, make 8 bucks a week? But you could have done anything. And I looked up to you my whole life for that. And following you. I don't know, Meyer. I don't know if it was worth my soul. 'Cause I don't know how to get that back. I'm aware that I was called here today to bear witness to your decision to kill my friend, Ben Siegel. And he saved my life on more than one occasion. I cannot sit here and watch you condemn him to death. But he's been robbin' from us, Meyer. I'm aware of Benny's shortcomings. I'm also aware that many of us would not be sitting here today if it weren't for Benny's past loyalty and his willingness to stick out his neck. If it's about money, I've agreed to make amends for his past mistakes. If it's about honor, I ask you where is the honor in killing a friend? Why don't you step outside, Meyer? In the matter of Bugsy Siegel... Ay. Ay. Ay. Ay. Ay. Ay. Ay. Hello. Daddy. Eva? Yes. Eva, what are you... what are you doing up? What time is it? I couldn't sleep. "I couldn't sleep." Honey, you gotta get to sleep. Got school tomorrow. But tomorrow is Saturday. Okay. Where's your mama? She went out. She went out, out where? With some man. You know, these things. It's... that's what's gonna happen, you know. Daddy, do you still love mommy? Honey, I love you. I love you. Mrs. Lansky. Who is it? It's Frank Rivers, ma'am, we spoke on the phone. Oh, yes. I remember. Sit down. Thank you. You know, there's no way in hell you're going to find that bastard's money. Why is that? My ex-husband, Meyer, he never let a dime out of his sight. If I were you, I would look to Cuba. That is where Meyer made his first real money. I thought he lost everything when Castro took over. You think he would give all that money to a communist. Uh, that Batista, he trusted no one, only Meyer. He gave Meyer what Meyer wanted. And what was that? To turn that country into the Monte Carlo of the Caribbean. If only it had lasted. Pfft. Here's one of his diets. Matiz Sardine, Jello, and Irish stew. - Blegh. - Ugh. Hey, there's a Lansky associate in Geneva. That might be our guy. Let's get Stone to run it by Lansky. I got it, of course. Hey David, I got a message for you. From Mr. Lansky. What... what do you want? I'm beginning to think you're not taking me seriously. Hey, he's not even here. I've got nothing. Man, I think we're done. I think the book is done. - I think... - Listen to me. We're looking for an associate of Lansky's. He goes by the name "Pinkus". He's 81, alright? He's mind's not that sharp. I think that some of the stuff he's been saying is... it's a little incoherent. Trust me, he'll remember this name. Find out who he is, okay? You've got a pen, I'll write it down. Pink-ass, that you could remember. Hello, David. Come in, come in. I didn't feel like going out today. You want coffee? No, thanks, I'm fine. Is that your father? When Israel turned me down, all I could think about was how embarrassed he would have been. I was always ashamed of him. In my mind, he was weak. Busting his balls earning pennies. He felt the same about me, shame for having a gangster for a son. I didn't go to his funeral, my own father. I don't have the power to change my past, I do have the power to change the perception of it. Do as I ask and you will be rewarded. You would do what I ask. Let's sit on the porch. Turn it back now. Switch over to two. What's going on? We lost, he knows we're listening to him. Goddammit. There's a name that came up in my research, someone named "Pinkus". Huh? Someone named "Pinkus". You mean Sal Rosenstein, tough son of a bitch, his entire family died at Takhel. After the war, he moved to Switzerland, did some banking for me. Pinkus was my nickname for him. Wanted Pinkus' identity, get a pen. Saul Rosenstein. Yeah, yeah. Put the money in my wife's account and make sure they're safe. And let my family alone. We found him. Who, Rosenstein? Yeah, he was in Geneva. Where is he now? He died 48 hours ago. Yeah, what the... It's Rivers, Saul Rosenstein was killed in a car accident - 48 hours ago. - Say again. I'm saying that Lansky had him killed. This is not a coincidence. I would advise you to stop talking to Lansky. Mr. Rivers, as soon as you called, we started running a query into our database. It appears Mr. Rosenstein moved his money primarily to one place, Israel. Rosenstein was Mossad. We've got a paper trail of laundered money going in and out of Geneva into Israel to a bank called "Mekif". And you think that money was Lansky's? I think it's why Lansky wanted to get into Israel. His money's there. Mr. Rivers, welcome to Israel. We've been expecting you. I will be taking you down to the vault. Here it is. Thank you. Son of a bitch. And God said to Abraham, "Abraham, take your son, your only son whom you love, Isaac, and sacrifice him upon one of the mountains that I will tell you." And Abraham went forth with Isaac to do just that. But perhaps what God really wanted was for Abraham to say, no. We praise God now for those who have departed this world as we stand for the Kaddish, let us all stand. Mr. Lansky, Mr. Lansky. David. Prayer for the dead, right? Kaddish. Is that for your father? Or was it for Saul Rosenstein? Remember Saul Rosenstein, your friend Pinkus is dead and he died in a car accident. I'm sorry to hear that. Three days ago. Are you suggesting I had something to do with it? I just think it's a bit coincidental, we were just talking about him and then something terrible happens to him. Maybe he's dead or maybe they just think he's dead. Just tell me the truth. You mean like the truth that you're speaking to the Feds? You betrayed me, David, you broke my heart, you made a deal with me and you broke your word. Yeah, I did talk to them. I did, yeah. You know why I did it? You call it "self-preservation", I think. Right, I had to do what I had to do for my family. Stand by. I forgive you, David. If you wanna hear the rest of the story... Why'd you forgive me? 'Cause I like you. You liked Sal Rosenstein, too. Not really. And now you come to Israel, for what reason? You want to become an Israeli citizen, Mr. Lansky? I do. My association with Israel stands many years back. I was born a Jew. I have all my life lived as a Jew. I never changed my faith. My grandparents are buried here. Why are the American authorities after you? They claim I have 50% of Lebanon casinos, 50% of Monte Carlo. Mr. Lansky, is there such a thing as organized crime? I have no knowledge on the subject and I'd like to live the remainder of my days in Israel. I got a tip from a friend, Golda Meir's lobbying Nixon to supply Israel with F-4 fighter bombers. What's that got to do with me? The prime minister was told that in order for that deal to go through, she'd have to see to that you leave Israel and return to the U.S. State Department is revoking your passport. You need to surrender at the embassy. The Law of Return says every Jew has the right to citizenship in Israel. There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. After everything I did for this country, after all I gave them when they begged me for money, for weapons. Doesn't she remember? This is how they repay me, making me the only Jew in history to be banned from his country. How dare she? How dare she? They've already arranged for your return to the U.S. They're charging you with contempt of court... Oh my God. And conspiracy related to your ownership at the Flamingo Hotel. I won't go back there. I want you to help me find a place, a country that will take me. I have money. Name the price. I don't want your money, Meyer. I believe your people have betrayed you. I'll say. And after all that, they were never able to indict you. The charges against me, contempt of court, conspiracy, they were dropped. You can go back to Israel. The wandering Jew, just like Lucky said. Have we arrived at the end of my story? What about the money? Hmm. Come for a ride. Buddy. Gangster? I'm an angel with a dirty face. I think we're finished, David. Go home. To your family. Remember me. When all is said and done, how do we measure ourselves? If Lansky taught me anything, it's that there's only one measure in this world that truly matters. We measure ourselves through the eyes of the ones we love. Somewhere on the stretch of highway between Miami and home, it all made sense. Lansky spent his life trying to control the game, but in the end, he knew there was one game that no one gets to control, life itself. And you can try to beat the odds. But the house always wins. Maybe all you need every now and then is a winning streak. You wanted to see me? Yeah, come on in, Frank. We're shutting the investigation down. Wait, what? Why? It's over, Frank. Who's killing it? The CIA? Before your time, sonny boy.
