But what makes this shaky marriage is that I am bound to another man. I have no desire for you, Charles. I know... ll need time to time. But if time can not do anything, it will be unfortunate. - More... - I ... It's okay. I am willing to marry you. For Louise and for you too. And I'm ready to take my marital obligations to a number of conditions. - Which? - I do not want another child. - No problem. Louise enough. - He'll have to take precautions. You do not want to have a child with you? - I'd be too afraid of having a boy that goes engrosser maggots on behalf of the country. What else? - The list is rather long. Good.
