For crying out loud, we've been sitting here forever! Not too late to turn back. Don't worry, Dad. I'm sure the road will clear up soon. Traffic was the one thing I thought we left behind. You're taking up two lanes! What are you doing? Come on, ya fat cow! Daddy, don't be mean! How is that mean? Look at her. Move, Bessie! We don't have all day! Let's go! You're making her nervous. Baby, it's fine. That's how milkshakes are made. Come on! Mia, what're you doing? Hey, cow! Moo-ve! Okay, then. Good try, baby. Okay, 10 more seconds and we're having burgers for dinner. - Dad, no! - Stop it, Daddy! Five, four, three, two... Oh! Oh! - Yay! - It's about time! Thank you! Okay, let's go. Whoa! - Whoa! - Oh, come on! You're up, Mia. Go tell this punk to baa-ck off. Okay, easy. Sip. Sip. Oh, Monroe, looks like we have company. I know, I know, I know. Hi! Welcome! Well, hello there! Welcome to the ranch. Oh, hello. Sorry it took so long. We got cow blocked. No worries. The girls got big, huh? Ah, sure did! Wow. So, who are you people? Uh... Uh, hi, Rose. You know us. I'm Louis. You asked the girls and I to... To come and help you with the ranch. We're Samantha's family. Oh, dear. My sweet Sam left us about a year past. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. We, uh... We're well aware. Um... You stayed with us, uh, in Chicago for the funeral. You helped out with the reception at our apartment afterwards. Remember? It was really sad. Oh, did you serve those little piggies in a blanket? Yeah. Emma made them. Oh, yes! It's all coming back. They were delicious! Did you bring any? Uh, no hors d'oeuvres, but we've got some gummy bears in the cup holder. Oh, that's a shame. Well, all right. Let's all get washed up for dinner, okay? - Grandma. - Yep? If you didn't even remember me, then why did you say I had gotten taller? Were you smaller once? Uh, yeah. Well, there you go. This is quite the spread, Rose. You sure you weren't expecting company? Oh, sometimes my boyfriend comes over to share some fiddles with me and Monroe. You have a boyfriend, Granny? Don't you? Burn! Well, at least I have friends. Not anymore. They're in Chicago. You'll make new friends in no time. Personally, I am very excited for this fresh start. I don't have to tell you, we've had quite the streak of bad luck this past year. You don't say? Mmm-hmm. I got laid off, our landlord sold the building, uh, Emma broke her arm. Mia's grades started slipping. Only in spelling. Spelling is hard. Yes, it is. Oh, the van needed a new fuel pump. That was really expensive. Uh, what else am I forgetting? We lost our mother. You're right, baby. That, uh, was hands down the worst thing that's ever happened to all of us. Well, everybody has bad days, and you just have to trust that the next one is gonna be a little bit better. - You gotta stay positive. - Mmm-hmm. Positive. Put your faith in your family, and there's nothing we can't overcome. I agree and I think the Dindals' luck is about to change. Here, here. I'll drink to that. Mia! You're such an idiot! I told you to stop playing around and to be careful. Whoa! Fire! Fire! Fire! - Fire! - It's okay, it's okay. There we go. Not a problem. Listen, Gran, I hope we're not being too much of an inconvenience. Just say the word and we're on the next flight back to Chicago. Right, Mia? Nonsense. As long as you make yourself scarce when my gentleman caller comes for Netflix and chill. Oh, your boyfriend, right. We'll, uh, give you your space, right, Mia? Right, Mia? Huh? Yeah. Space. Space. The final frontier. You are not guests, you're family. This is your home now. But this is a working ranch. You know what that means. - You work? - Exactly. Oh, crap. Time for chores! Whoa! Rise and shine, time for school! You're snoring. Who is that? What? You're mumbling. I thought I saw a man with a hat and a long jacket. Did you? It's here. Get up. Come on. Try to blend in. There's no seats together. Ask someone to move. Just take this one. Ugh. Patrick. Is that your name? No, it's the name of the seat. Name of what? See, that window is Ben. Girl's book over there goes by Julie. And in the cafeteria there's a big ol' lunch table named Kimmy. Gotcha. I, um, like your scissors. You mean Jeff? What grade are you in? I just moved here from Chicago. Do you mind? I'm trying to finish breakfast here. Jimmy J. John gave 16 bushels of huckleberries to Sally Mae Sue, who gave 11 to Mary Sally Mae, who returned three to Jimmy J. John before spotting six to Sally Mary Mae's bro, Johnny Jim Sue. Mia, how many bushels may Mary Sally Mae have? What's a huckleberry? Mia, how do you spell "coulie"? Can you use it in a sentence? De flat swam plumly down the creek through the coulie. Coulie. K... Grab yourself a brush and get creating, children! What am I painting here, a house? The magic of art is not what you see, but what you make others see. Splendid. Good use of the negative capability, Stephanie. The assignment was to paint a dog. Dog went home, that's his mess. How's your day been so far? Remember first grade when I brought a box of cookies to school that I put on the stoop, and I didn't know that a rat got inside the box and ate and pooped, and then when I opened the box it jumped out, bit Mrs. Brenner on the pinky toe and gave her rabies? Yeah. That was a better school day. Even for Mrs. Brenner. Pizza, please. Oh, sorry, dear. The girl right in front of you got the very last slice. Not a problem. What else you got? We got spinach casserole or tuna surprise. Oh, my gosh, I'm gonna barf. So gross. Bet you wish for some rat-chewed cookies about now. Hey, Patrick, right? Mind if I stomp my tray here down on big ol' Kimmy? What did you say? I just wanted to sit on Kimmy. - You lookin' to fight me? - No! What... You're not... No, I... Hey, Kimmy, just relax. New girl wants to go. I didn't... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, Kimmy! You mess with the bull, you get the horns. Now what? You gonna go cry to your mommy? Our mom is dead. Well... Sucks to be you. Hey, ain't that something? I just did a painting of your jacket. You got two options. Run to the store to get my pills, or help me pluck this bird. Johnny Appleseed planted red Granny Smiths, not them green ones. Certainly not Fuji apples, them's are from the Orient. Willie, that's a made-up story. It's folklore. It ain't real. He's a legend. An American icon. Yeah, yeah, Willie, you know everything. Hey there, what can I get ya? You? You work here? You like asking obvious questions. I'm picking up an order for Johansen. Hmm. Sorry about Kimmy, by the way. Don't you worry, she's a big softie. Right, right. Is she your girlfriend? Are you serious? Psst. Over here. You. Over here. Come on. You Rose's kin? - Yes. - Hot diggity! Welcome to town! Name's Willie. Put it there, little lady. These here are the boys. Howdy. Howdy. Oh, yeah. You look just like your mama. Are you a spitfire like her, too? Huh? I think so. I mean, I reckon. You gals are gonna love it here. Your granny, she's as sweet as molasses, and so is that ranch of hers. Let me tell ya, the woods behind 'em, there's, uh... There's something magical about them. Really? Oh, he's just pulling your leg there, pretty sunshine. You know, just last week old Willie here claims that he saw UFOs out there behind McGuire's pumpkin patch. I said it might have been alien, okay? It could have been a phantom, or some kind of extra-terrestrial poltergeist hybrid. I said that! Anyways! I can tell you are a believer. Someone who knows the impossible is always possible. The word "impossible" literally means... Okay. Let's go. It was nice meeting you. Mia, it's not magical. It's just a plain, stupid forest, like the stupid farm and the stupid... Oh, crap. Hi, Kimmy. So good to see you. I am sorry about the whole cafeteria mix-up thing today. Too late for sorrys. Priscilla! Whoa, lady! Call off your goon! Oh, does mommy's little baby wanna eat the two little girls? Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. Look, we don't want any trouble, just let us get by you and... First let's see what's in the bag. It's just heart medication. Pass. What else you got? Nothing that you'd want. Just our bikes. What? You had us worried sick! Where are your bikes? Where have you been? I forgot my phone. That's no excuse. Unacceptable! I wanna go back to Chicago! Enough with the attitude, young lady. This is your home now. Get used to it. I hate this place! And I hate you for making us come here! Don't talk to me like that! Emma! Emma! Don't... What's with her? Got mugged by a dragon. Been there. Hey. Just go away. I just wanna show you something real fast. Ooh. I love what you've done with the place. Sorry, that was... Ribbit. Look... I know this big change is hard, but if you just give it... I believe, if you have a little faith in your family and you just try, you might find that you actually kind of like it here. That's what you said about artichokes. Exactly. - And now who loves them? - Mia. I still hate them. Oh. Hmm. Anyway, this is what I wanted to show you. Oh, look at all this. Oh, crazy Grandma, there she is. And where is it? Oh, here it is. That is your mother at this very ranch. She's about Mia's age. Oh, look how happy she is living here. If she actually lived here, I'd love this place, too. I know you would, baby. What about artichoke dip? Nope. Ah, okay. Oh! Oh, my. Oh... Granny, what happened? Are you okay? Yeah, it was nothing. I just took a tiny spill. Oh, Monroe, I'm fine. You go back to bed. Don't you fret about your old granny. Come here. I'm worried about you. - Oh... - Emma, Daddy. School. Everything. Oh, worrying is just like a rocking horse. It's something to do that gets you nowhere. Hey, everybody has bad days. Come on, lay down. The thing is, you just gotta believe the next one is gonna be a little bit better. You got a spark. You are just like your mama. You know, even when she got so sick, she didn't think that anything was impossible. Impossible is always possible? Exactly. That's why you gotta keep believing with your whole heart. You might not see her, or hear her, but her spirit is always with you. Hey, Emma. Can I borrow your phone? I'll take that as a yes. Thanks. What is that? Oh, hey, Monroe. Monroe! Please, Monroe, come back! Please? No, no! Come on, Monroe! Come on, Monroe, where are you? Don't scare me like that! Oh, my... Hurry, Emma! Wake up! You gotta see this! Come on, wake up! Please! It's 4:00 a.m. We don't have to get up for another 20 minutes. Please? I gotta show you something. I told you not to touch my phone! Pretty awesome, huh? Why is it so shaky? I was holding a pig. Who cares? Can you believe it? They are real. - What are real? - Unicorns! Go to bed. I found a unicorn, everybody! - Psst. Dad, can you look at this? - Huh? What? You see a unicorn, right? See what? The unicorn. - Right? - No. I told you! Really? Maybe your eyes are still too sleepy. I'll make you some coffee to wake you up. Go to bed! Both of you! Come on, Mia. And wash your face. What're you doing? Oh, my. Yes. This is a beautiful white unicorn colt. I tell ya, those woods are littered with them. - Really? - I told you. I'm gonna show you something that is really gonna blow your noggins. I think that's called an 8-track. My boyfriend shot this in the back of the bait and tackle shack. There's no way that gigantic black tape only fits eight movies. Here is indisputable proof that there is a real live Sasquatch. I'm still waiting to see proof of the boyfriend. Look, look, look. The sloping forehead, the size 17 Nikes. That's a real live bigfoot. Accupril, Zocor, Prilosec, Piroxicam, Lyrica, Toprol, Colace, Stelara, Acuvail, CardioMax, Maalox, Rheumatrex, Mayra, Lorazepam. Hey, Emma, can I show them your phone? No. Let me ask you guys something. What do you guys know about unicorns? Well, you know, the horn has a lot of protein and potassium inside. Stop it! Rumor has it that they come from, uh, Valhalla or Pittsburgh... Stop! I happen to be an expert on the Equus Monoclonius. Oh, yeah. Sure you are, Willie. Why'd you ask? You, uh... You seen one, honey? Uh... Huh? No. Doing a school report. Ah. Unicorns are most definitely real. Every culture has their own legend. The, uh, natives said that the horn, or alicorn, when touched, has the power to heal. If you capture one, and it's very hard to do now, you'll become extremely lucky, so long as that critter's always by your side. Go ahead and tell her about that vampire thing. It ain't like a vampire at all! A vampire? Now, you, uh... You wouldn't wanna do this, 'cause... 'Cause the unicorn would die. But they say if you remove the horn and drink its blood... Ugh, so gross! ...you'll have eternal life. Like a vampire. And they both fly. No, you guys are thinking of a Pegasus. Those are two completely different species. You don't know nothing about unicorns! Before I put you wise, you thought a yeti was a Barbra Streisand movie, huh? That was Elizabeth Presley! Elizabeth Presley? You gonna get the hiccups, Willie! Hey, listen! It's Priscilla Presley, Elizabeth Taylor... You don't know nothing! - That's it! - You gonna get hit! - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! You think I'm gonna get the hiccups? You got 'em. It's simple. We catch us a unicorn. Willie says they bring good luck. We sure could use some. You think we should take advice from a guy named Crazy Willie? We bought our toaster from Crazy Dave's Appliances. "The word 'unicorn' is Latin. "An all clean, horn-hold, healing eli..." Elixir. It's like a magic power. Right. "But you gotta grip the horn real tight." Uh-huh. And I heard that their farts smell like cotton candy. I don't see that, but the unicorn reference was in the Bible nine times! And no mention of farting? - No. - Huh. Weird. This guy, Leonardo da Vinci, not the Ninja Turtle, said exactly how to capture one. Ah! "The unicorn for the luck it bears fair maidens "forgets its ferocity and wildness, "and laying aside all fear will go to its weeping damsel, "will go to sleep in your lap and thus the hunters can take it." Drop it, Mia. It ain't happening. You don't have to believe in unicorns, but please, could you try to believe in me? If I go on this little hunting expedition with you, you have to help me convince Dad to go back to Chicago. Um... Okay. Deal. Even if we don't bag us a unicorn? Not a problem. Um, I'll pass. Greek mythology, European folklore, da Vinci, this poet William Rose Bennet. Benét. All of them used the same bait to catch a unicorn. A pure and innocent damsel in a white dress sits weeping under a tree, flowers woven in her hair. You want me to cry beneath a tree? You? Implying I'm not pure and innocent? The spin the bottle game at Martha Thompson's birthday party pretty much closed that chapter. Hey! Can we go now? Uh! No. I think I got an idea. Can you come over here? I want you to pull my hair. What? I'm not gonna pull your hair. - Just do it. - No. - Just do it! - No. Just do it! Fine! Ow. Why'd you do that? You told me to! I didn't think it'd hurt so... Well? Am I crying? Not even a tear. It's no use. I was sure it could work. It's not fair. Why don't good things ever happen for us? Don't worry. It'll be okay. I miss Mommy so much. Me, too. You believe I saw it, right? The unicorn? I do. I really do. Goodness, it's freezing out here. Let's get home. Sound good? Okay. What was that? Huh? I just thought I heard something. What the heck is that? Quick! Hide! Go, please! Go! No way! Hi there. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, settle. Settle. It's okay. It's okay. Settle. Settle. Settle. I think its foot is hurt. Don't worry, we're friendly. Wanna come home with us? My very own unicorn! I'm gonna name her Princess Rainbow Sparkle. It's a boy. Yeah? How do you know? By its, um, its horn. Oh. Then we'll name him... Rocco. Why Rocco? Obviously 'cause he looks like a Rocco. Obviously. Welcome to your new home, Rocco. - Dad, wake up! - What! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! What's going on? Is everything okay? Follow us! Follow us! Come on! Okay, okay, okay, I'm coming! Hurry! Okay, okay. I'm coming, I'm coming. What're you wearing? Did you get married? Come see! Come on! Follow us, come on! Shh. He's coming. Over here, Dad. What's going on? The coyotes? Guess what we got? Help me out here. What am I looking at? You don't see it? Uh, the rope flapping in the wind? You really don't see it? See what? The unicorn! We'll talk about this in the morning. Huh. Maybe only kids can see it. Whoa. Maybe it's time to re-think the Easter bunny. Come on, eat it. It's good. See? See? Put some in your mouth to show him. Put it in your mouth. Up a little late, are we? Uh-oh. Looks like someone doesn't wanna stay at my ranch. You mean Emma, or... The yearling. Oh, he looks so much like the one your mama played with. And I notice he has a sprain. How did that happen? Our mother owned a unicorn? Nobody owns a unicorn. They do what they want, when they want. Your mother's colt friend attracted some desperate desperadoes. Hiya! Hiya! Whoa! But your mama... She would always protect her friend. No! No! Uh... But please, can I keep him? I promise, I'll feed him, brush him, take him out on walks, and even polish his horn every day. Honey, I need you to understand. This is a mighty, powerful creature. It is very easy to take advantage. There is a reason that unicorns are not seen by humans. Most folks are not prepared to handle this kind of magic. Willie says if you take off the horn and drink its blood, you'll live forever. Not like I was going to. And then misfortune will follow you everywhere, cursed for eternity. That doesn't sound like a lot of fun, does it? Right? Girls, I don't think you realize how much power you're wielding here. Without respect, it is dangerous. So should we just take him back? He can stay for a couple of days, just until his leg heals. You okay with that? All right. Thank you. Good night, Rocco. Sleep tight. I'll race you. Let's go. Ready? Go. Oh, you're so slow! Come on! So I only saw him because I believe Mia saw it? Yes. You put your faith in your family and great things happen. Did Mommy really have a unicorn, too? Or were you just fooling? No. Your mama and that unicorn were like two nuts in a chipmunk's cheek. The things he would do for her. But your mama knew never to take advantage of that friendship. Not a problem. I'm already working on a ruby and diamond collar. Really classy, not tacky. Okay. Very nice. All right, I want you to say your prayers and go to sleep. I'm not used to this. Sweet dreams, babies. Good night, Grandma Rose. Yeah, good night. Bless Emma and Daddy and Grandma Rose and Monroe and Paco the goat and Sheryl the cow and all the chickens. Harry, Joanne, Hunter, Sean, Stephanie, - Big Ronnie, Little Ronnie... - Just go to sleep. ...Tony, Walter, Medium-sized Ronnie... Will you just go to sleep? Most of all, thank you, Mommy, for sending Rocco from heaven. With his help, I'm sure it's gonna get a lot better for all of us. I miss you. Love you. Amen. Girls, I am already having a hard time adjusting to this new job, but now I'm gonna be groggy and sluggish all day. I can't... Hey. Are you listening to me? - Oh, yes, sir. Yes. - Oh. Of course. - Yes. - Listen, this is important. Oh, this is such a big change for me, too. Not just for you. Oh. Do you think... You think that's funny? - Oh, no, sir. No. - Absolutely not. - No. - Okay. We're done here. Just... Just go do your chores and then off to school, okay? Yes sir. All right. Come on, come on. You can do it. Good boy! Whoa! Hey! Rocco, you can do it. Come on, Rocco. Rocco, you can do it. Heads. Awesome! That's a hundred times in a row. This is incredible! It's amazing! This luck must be coming from Rocco! You think? What do you wanna do next? Let's try something really cool. What do you have in mind? Whoo! I found the needle! Now that's gotta be a world record. I'm thinking this might be a bad idea. You'll be a good boy today, Rocco? See? Not a problem. Come on. Morning, everyone. Do you believe this? It's like nobody sees him. I guess they're just too distracted by their phones or just too cynical to be believers. I weep for this generation. Let's go, Rocco. Let's go. Rocco, what are you doing? You're gonna get us in trouble. Hey. Who's Rocco? Your boyfriend or something? No, it's just my sister's unicorn. - Touché. - Ah, great. Now he thinks I'm lovesick for my old Italian boyfriend. Nobody will ever believe you actually had a boyfriend. Why'd he close the window? It's a bit nippy. - Ew! - It's everywhere! One, two, three, four, five, six. The answer is six. Bravo, Crystal. The spatial relationship is very disturbing. Magnificent. The word is "stroopwafel." Stroopwafel. S-T-R-O-O-P- W-A-F-E-L. Stroopwafel. That is correct. Pizza, please. Can't get 'em to detach. Just take all three slices. Not a problem! Thanks, Rocco. Lunchroom toll. Three slices of... Sucks to be you. Says he needs just enough for a bus ride to his family in Vermont. Naturally, I gave him what I had. That's mighty neighborly. Well, when am I gonna get another chance to meet a real live Big Foot, huh? Oh, yeah, absolutely. I suppose I could build a hunting blind in the alley behind Dixie... Holy! Did you guys see that? The chupacabra? Or that leprechaun on that motorcycle? No, no, it's... My mistake. Weren't nothing there. It's my dang cataracts. I don't get it. What's the matter with him? Didn't you have fun today? What's the matter, bud? I got it. You want a carrot. Carrot. Come on, carrot. Carrot. You know, he's just had a long day. Probably really tired. Good night, Rocco. Tomorrow will be better. You just gotta believe it. Good night, Rocco. Emma, did you hear something? Go to sleep. I think someone's out there. What is that? Do you hear that moaning? Yeah, I do. Whoa! So gross. This is, uh... Um... Bud. Bud. This is my boyfriend. - Howdy. - Hi. I'm sorry y'all thought I was spying, I didn't mean to scare you, I was just waiting for y'all to go - so I could come over and... - Suck face. So, so, very, very gross. Monroe! It's past your bed time. All right, well, I guess I better skedaddle. - All right. - Good night, ladies. - It's dang late. - Good night, Bud. Come on, bed time. See? I do have a boyfriend. Okay. All right. Oh, well. You gotta be the most beautiful thing these old cataract eyes ever seen. This is great! This is wonderful! Hey. No more back pain. Hey. No more arthritis. I'll be taking that horn. That ain't happening, mister! Oh, you're crazy! Dang it! You're out of your mind! Emma, I'm sure I heard something. Just go back to sleep. Go back to bed, honey. Ow! Who poked me? Rose? - Hey. - You! Whoa! Now, Rose, calm down. I... Ooh. Your, uh... Your ticker giving out, huh? Rose? You out here? Well, adiós, Rose. Rose? Emma, what's going on? I'm not sure. What's going on? Dad? Dad. - Grandma! - Girls, girls! - Grandma! - Hey, hey, hey. It's okay, it's okay. - What's going on? - Everything's fine. Don't worry. Come with me. - Just come with me. - What happened? Don't worry about it. Everything's fine. What's wrong with her? - Is she gonna be okay? - She's going in the ambulance for a little bit. Don't worry. Dad, what happened to her? She took a little spill and she's gonna be in the hospital for a short while. Is she gonna be okay? Of course she's gonna be okay. Look, girls, when you get older your body doesn't work so well and you can't really do all the things you used to do when you were younger. Well, your grandma, she's... Well, she's very strong-willed. It's just her heart... But she has the best heart in the whole world! That she does. She does, honey. I'll tell you what, son. You choose the biggest, meanest hombre out here and I'll clean his plough. I am willing... I am willing to bet my whole Social Security check on it, huh? How about that? Whoa, wait. Now, if I win, I get eight seconds with that varmint, huh? Right? One, two, three! But it's Saturday. I know, baby, but I gotta get caught up somehow. I'm sorry. Look, I'll be home early and we can go visit Grandma. How's that sound? I want to see her now. I'm pretty sure I got a way to fix her heart. What's that? How? Our unicorn. Baby... I love your wild imagination, I really do. You get it from your mom. But there's some real serious grown-up things happening right now, so I need you to shut it down, okay? No more unicorns, all right? Be good today. Are you crazy? You said it. He has magical powers. - We gotta bring him to Grandma. - Just forget it, okay? I promised Dad we'd stay out of trouble. That hospital is like 100 miles away. The impossible is always possible. Emma, what if Gran... What if she... I won't sit around and wait. Not again. Not if I can do something about it this time. Okay. What's the plan, sis? This disguise makes no sense. We don't know who's a believer. If we come across anybody who can see him, then they'll just think it's a fancy pony going to a wedding or a supermarket opening. You're forgetting one thing. A monocle? The hat's not magical. Oh, yeah. You know, I'm starting to re-think this 'cause Rocco's leg looks like it's healed. Maybe we should just bring him back to the forest. No! I mean, not until we get to the hospital. You wanna help Granny, don't you, Rocco? See? Seriously? Hey, Priscilla. Look who's back. Okay, Kimmy, don't mess with us today. We've had a family emergency with our grandmother and are trying to go to the hospital. Completely understand. Just pay the town entrance fee and you can both be on your way. This is extortion. All we have left is Emma's babysitting money and $16.11 from my piggy... Stop helping her! Let's make this quick. Priscilla's getting her nails done at 4:00 and it's been a while... What? Who? Who poked me? I got you... Listen. Whatever's going on... My shoulder. I felt a sharp pain. Perhaps you're having a stroke. No, it... It's something else. I know what it is. It's the spirit of our deceased mother, here to protect us and guide us along our way. Bull. I don't believe in spirits. That ghost stuff ain't possible. The impossible is always possible. Mom, jab this bully's left shin! Hey! How did you do that? Right butt cheek! Left shin! Right knee! Smack her face! Stomp her foot! Please, make the poking stop! She messes with you and I? Ya get the horn! Here ya go. Put that on. There. One, two, three, bullets! Read 'em and weep. Oh! Sorry, amigos. Well, I guess it's generic Aspercreme for me this week. Come on, Deek. You know the 2-7 is the worst hand you could ever have in poker. That's the hammer. Sheesh. Who's in for the next one? Hey, guys. Hey, pretty girl. How're you doin'? Where's Willie? He's probably still tuckered out from bingo last night. He didn't even show up for bingo last night. Huh. Well, what do you want with him, little lady? I wanted to show him my new unicorn. Oh. Oh, she's a beauty. Uh-huh. It's a he. See the horn? Oh, yeah. Yeah, uh-huh. I see it. Look, I feel for you and your granny, all right? But there's no way I'm stealing my pa's truck. Especially for some dumb, make-believe critter. He's not... Okay, how about this? We make a bet, all right? We flip a quarter and if it lands on heads 10, no, 20 times in a row, then you help us. If I lose, you get $57 and a gift card to Komodo Dragon Dress Emporium. Sure. Easy money. It was a trick coin, right? It was your quarter. All right, you know what? Let's go again. This time with a nickel, okay? Mmm-hmm. What? Triple or nothing. Argh! I don't know if it's safe back here. Rocco's magic will protect me. That's crazy. Well, we're staying off the highway so nobody sees us, so it's gonna be pretty bumpy. Fine with me. See you later, Rocco. Oh, come on! 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97... Someone took their vitamins. Oh, no, honey. This is... This is from 100% pure unicorn. Wow. I think I tried some of that at Coachella. Whoo! How's about you and I paint the town red tonight? A little dinner, a little dancin', think you can keep up with me? Oh, dude. You got a lot of energy, but you're hella old. I was hella younger yesterday. William, your days are numbered. Who says it has to stay this way, huh? When I said we should lay low, I did not mean literally. Look, I'm doing the best I can here, all right? I can't even reach the gas. Can you even see the road? Yeah, maybe a little bit. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh! Does not smell like cotton candy to me! Slow down! Hit the brake! Hit the brake! Let's go, come on! Uh-oh. Oh, no! Sure a lot of potholes on this road! Slow down! This is a lot harder than go-karts! You think? The shocks on this thing are terrible! What is that smell? It wasn't me. Cows! Move! Stop farting! Okay, that's it! No more carrots for you! Try the emergency brake! What are you doing? Whoa, that thing has so many uses. It's like a Swiss army horn. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We're crashing for a tree! Mayday! Mayday! You're making a heart. That is so adorable. Are we slowing down? What? Huh. What's going on? What just happened? This is impossible. There is no way we should have survived that. Didn't you hear? The impossible is apparently possible. I don't like it. You okay back there? Uh-huh. Could use an air freshener. Come on, Rocco. Out. No. It can't... You gotta be kidding. Clive's Auto Repair. About 40 miles from here. Should I call? I guess. It's gonna take him at least a couple hours to find his way out here and tow us back into the shop. Gosh, I'm in so much trouble. Worrying is like a rocking horse. It don't get you nowhere. And we'll be fine as long as he's by our side. Girl's got a little country in her. You think? Yeah. I like how you take everything in stride. You know what you want and you don't let nothing get in your way. How? We haven't even called him yet. I was hoping that would happen! Oh, no, no, no! This ain't good! Still fresh. Still fresh. Now, where did those little brats take him? Ooh, cotton candy. No, think, Will! Think! Okay, it's the weekend, it's the week... Kids ain't in school and, uh, um, I gotta find 'em. I gotta find 'em. And fast! Oh, get out! Four tires, new brake pads, and fixing that trailer floor with three hours of labor and parts we're looking at $367. Well then, pony up, everybody. Even with Kimmy's charitable donation we're still short $100. I got an idea. Could you do that 99 more times? Rocco, may I? One hundred buckaroos! All right, let's go pay the man. And we'll go to the hospital and get Gran across the street. All right, come on, Mia. Soda, please. Thanks! Come on, Rocco. Where are they? What? Where? Where's them Dindal girls? Dang, Willie, what's got you riled? You got a scorpion in your britches? They caught themselves one real live honest to goodness unicorn. You better get yourself a new cow... 'Cause we're tired of this old bull! Hey, stop that! How'd he do that? Dang! You all can have this power, too. Heck, better. How'd you like to live forever? Forever? All we have to do is hunt down one little old unicorn. But them two girls took off with Patrick a few hours ago. Yeah, and we don't know where. Well, I do. Are you sure they'll let us have an animal in the hospital? Sure. We'll say he's an emotional support unicorn. Okay, she's on the fourth floor. We do not want any unwanted attention for us or the unicorn. Where is Rocco? - He walked right... - There he is. Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no! Rocco! Rocco! No, no! Okay, you take the stairs, I'll wait to see if he comes back down. Go, go, go! And you will see what He has done If you look around this world, my friend And you will see what He has done You can hear You can hear You can hear And you can hear what He has done... Mr. Bachman, this is a simple surgery. We'll have that gallbladder out lickety-split. Uh, I see a unicorn? The anesthesia has kicked in. But I haven't turned on the gas. Rocco? Rocco. A-ha! Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. Sorry! Which way? Did you see the unicorn? - He smiled at me! - Sure he did. - That way. - Can I get two ccs of lithium? Is that bigfoot? Hi. Where did you come from? You're so soft. Whoa. Wow! Any luck, guys? No, he's still MIA. That's me. I'm M-I-A. What're you talking about? I'm Mia. Over here. This way. How do these kids see Rocco when the kids at school didn't? 'Cause these kids need to believe the impossible is still possible. Ready to see Grandma, Rocco? Come on. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Gran? You awake? It's your granddaughters, remember? I see you brought Rocco with you. Yeah, for you. To make you better. Is that so? So all you gotta do is just put your hands on his horn and you'll be as good as new. Okay? No more of your spells or forgetting everything. You... Oopsie... What's the matter? You need help? No. Thank you. She doesn't understand. You don't understand. This will fix you. I got my own magic. So do you. So I'm just gonna hang on to my rusty old parts until the warranty runs out. You know what I'm saying? But we have Rocco and he'll solve all your problems like he did for me. But I... Don't you hate forgetting everything all the time? Baby, forgetting your past makes it easier to let go. No, you need it! You need it! I've had a good, long life. And I've laughed as much as I cried. But all you gotta do is just put your hand on his... Girls, girls. Babies, babies, babies. Look at our friend. Look at how short and colorless his horn is. How did we not notice that? What's the matter with him? Well, I think he's running out of good fortune, and I certainly don't want him to spend the last of it on me. You best get him back to the woods to his herd and his mama before it's too late. - His mother? - Yeah, baby. Will you do that for me? I wanna hear you say it. Not a problem. I'm so proud of you. You're coming with us? Well, I might be on my way out, but it's not today. Come on, Rocco, let's go. Yeah, that's great. Thank you so much. All right. All right, thanks. Bye-bye. What? Mechanic said the truck's ready. - Oh, good. - Awesome. Rose? Where y'all going? The woods. And you're driving. Okay, let's go. Good boy. So, handsome. What are your intentions with my granddaughter? - Uh, me? - Yeah. Uh... Oh, look! The cows! Mia, he does not look good. It's my fault. I took advantage of you and I took you away from your family. And Emma and I know what it's like to be without your mother. It's the worst thing that could ever possibly happen. We'll get you back to your family, Rocco. I promise. Oh. What's going on out there? Excuse me, I'll be taking these keys. Oh. Ladies, this here is a holdup! Leave him alone! He's weak! He needs to get back to his mother! No! You fool! Do you have any idea what you're getting yourself into? No, not exactly. Come on! Don't hurt him! Leave him alone! Come on! Willie, stop it! You're a taker and a bully and you've got a dark heart! At least mine's gonna last forever. You're gonna be one of the most cursed men that ever walked the Earth! The old bag's right. Boys, before we take his horn we need to get ourselves a good-sized nest egg. Hiya! This is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. That's actually easier than you think. This, however, is pointless. We're not giving up! Hey, Emma. I'm sorry I was such a jerk when I first met you. You weren't that big a jerk. Is it okay if... Grody. I'd really like to kiss... Dad's here! Oh, finally. Oh, my God. Yes, I will get the jackets. You two are in deep trouble! What are you thinking? And with your grandmother in the hospital, no less. I don't mind. Rose. What're you doing here? She's helping us save Rocco. What... Which one's Rocco? The old cowboy or the new one? Oh, those two handsome gentlemen are Emma's and my beaus. Beaus like boyfriends? I know. So gross, right? We'll talk about that later. Okay, so, um, who is Rocco? Our unicorn. Okay, okay. Um... Get in the car. Now! - Oh, oh, God. - Okay. Yeah. You brought Monroe? Of course I did! I'm not gonna leave him at home alone, he's only two. Let's break the bank, boys. - Dad? - The kids didn't have anything to... Not interested! Well, Emma. Looks like you're gonna get your wish after all. How do you mean? I called Uncle Jeff in Chicago today. Him and Aunt Erica agreed to help keep you in line. Lord knows I can't. I don't wanna go back. I like it here. It's my home now. What? I... You know what? At this point, I don't care what you want. What I want, Dad, is to go after Rocco! We think we know where they took him! - What are you talking about? - Willie... Everybody! Shh! Not another peep. You asked me to show a little faith in family. How about you, Dad? Trust in family. There's nothing you can't overcome. You don't go swimming in deep water with your britches on. - That's true, actually. - Enough! That's true. Everyone shut it! Shut it. I live with a bunch of crazy people. Dad, you don't have to believe in unicorns. Just believe in us. Oh, I can't believe I'm gonna do this. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where do you think you're going? Kids aren't allowed in there. - But Rocco. - We'll get him. Sit tight. Oh, uh, by the way, Monroe's diaper needs changing. That's true. Two bullets. Ooh. Hey, Willie, uh, me and the boys, we were thinking that maybe we go, uh, dancing, and maybe, uh, you know, kind of get the chew on, 'cause we're hungry. Yeah, I haven't had corn on the cob in 20 years. We're not leaving till we clean this place out. Then, the ritual sacrifice. Uh, pardon me, gentlemen. Don't mean to interrupt. Um, may I have a quick word? We ain't been cheatin'. Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no. I... Is one of you Crazy Willie? Just plain Will is fine, thank you. What you want, stranger? Ah, well, hi, Will. Um... This is a little embarrassing, but, um, I'm Mia Dindal's father and... That sweet little cash cow ain't goin' nowhere. Whoa. No, no, no, no. Wait, is it a calf or a colt? It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Look, sir, there is no reason to get violent here. Don't make me tell you twice. Okay. I'll just... Now, where were we? Am I the big blind? Hi, sorry, me again. Uh, how about you just hand me those reins and I walk right out of here. You got rocks for brains, son? I... - You had your fun. - Let him go! - All of you, get! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, hey, miss, I'll have a Sea Breeze please. A twist of lime. - What're you... - I'm thirsty. There ain't no way I'm ever gonna leave with that... Two seven off suit. You've been dealt a hammer. That's the worst hand a man can get. - Yes! - Oh, no, you don't. - Go, go! - Where do you think you're going? Oh! Take some of my magic, Rocco. You got nowhere to go, little lady! Yeah! Don't let her get away! That... That's a unicorn. That's a unicorn. When we tell my dad about this, can we leave out... I mean, he'll probably be cool with me doing something stupid for a pretty girl, but... Stealing his truck for a unicorn? You think I'm pretty? You like asking obvious questions. Mia! Where is she going? I cannot catch a break. Go, Rocco, go! She's heading for the hills. Willie. Willie. Willie, just hold your roll here for a second, Willie, will ya? The pretty little girl, you might hurt her. No mights about it. Dang, you are crazy. Willie, we didn't sign up for that. You're just gonna have to deal us out, Willie. - Deal us out. - Suit yourselves. - Willie! - Everyone in the car. - Come on, let's go! - You get in the back. - Okay. - Buckle up. You have got to be kidding me! Moo-ve! Come on, Rocco. You ain't gonna get away this time, missy! Come on, boy. I'm putting all my faith and trust in you. That's it, boy! That's it! Dad, she's going around that corner! Don't lose 'em! - Step on it! - Go! - I am trying! - Go! Missy, you are a pain in my neck, you know that? Come on! Leave her alone! Stop it! - You better not hurt her! - Stop it! Go, Mia! Go away! That idiot's gonna kill her! Watch out, baby! Oh, dang! - Mia! - No! Mia! Mia! Mia! Mia! Mia! No! No, no, no, this can't be happening! No! Mia! No! Mia! No... She's gone. No, no, no, no, no. Holy molasses! They really can fly. Impossibly possible. Yay! That's incredible! Come on. Come on. Come on, guys, keep up. I... I think it's... Yeah. Over here. Come on. I have gotta get a picture of this. Unbelievable. You may not see us or hear us, but know our spirit will always be with you. Goodbye, Rocco. Have you ever seen anything more beautiful? Hmm. Sure have. Oh, don't look. So gross. Help! Hey... Hey! Little girl! I was... I was just jesting.
