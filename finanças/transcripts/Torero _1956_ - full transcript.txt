With the bullfighters: The life of Luis Procuna. Adapted for film by: Hugo Mozo y Carlos Velo. The bulls are in the bullring, my name is on the poster. Tomorrow, Sunday, at exactly four o'clock I shall fight another bull. Once again a bull can get at me, perhaps even kill me. On the morning of a bullfight my first thought is: Will it be windy? In the bullring, it's bad news. It ruins my chances when I'm in front of the bull. No, there's no wind. I can have breakfast a little more easily with my kids. I love watching them eat everything. Whereas I just have an orange and a little broth. I have to feel weightless. Frankly when I think about being gored in the stomach, fear takes away my appetite. You want a piece, do you? Open your mouth. There we are. Fatty isn't eating. What? Aren't you hungry? That's it, very good, very good. It's delicious. Go for it, silly, go for it. That's it, silly boy. What's the matter with you? Come on, go for it! That's the way! Great! Wait for me, silly! By playing with them, I try to forget my worries. But I don't stop thinking about the wind. Later, like every Sunday, I visit my mother's grave. And even there, I don't stop thinking about the bullring. I imagine how my brother, Angel, and my manager, Arturo, are looking at the bulls. And by this time they will have drawn lots for them. - Which one d'you like best? - That one. - Let him know. Make him move a little. Hey bull! You choose, Arturo, let's see how much luck you have today. I don't know. Let's see if we get the one from Cachuchita. It'd be the best lot. It's number 18. Going to be a good one. I know they're out there... waiting for me. I like keep my worries at bay with a little music. While my sword boy slowly begins to dress me. For old times? sake The light of the full moon shines over the whole pasture... Good luck. You know you're our best matador. You've never let us down and especially not now. Your good health, sir! Let's go. Hey, good luck Luis, I wish you all the luck in the world, eh? Thank you very much. You look really good from the back. At least that's something! Arturo. Please tell them what the bulls are like. They're in great shape with horns like this, like two bananas. They're impressive. They sure are! The jacket, please. Two minutes. Now you'll see what the bulls are like, Luis. Gently. Lift it up. They want to keep me calm. But they don't have to go out into that bullring and I do. For me... As the hour gets closer. I feel more alone every time, more in the hands of fate. This Sunday is different from the others. My wife is not coming to the bullring to watch me fight. For all that she tries to hide it, she's scared. Very scared. Go ahead. What a marvellous spectacle we'll have this afternoon, Three great bullfighters: Carlos Arosa, Manolo Dosantos and of course, that great personality that controversial figure who's returning to the bulls after his much-talked about absence, Luis Procuna. And now, when my mouth is as dry as can be. I ask myself: What am I doing here? Why am I going to the bullring to confront a bull and the public one more time? Why? And my head fills with memories. Toro! I was a kid like this one, like so many in poor neighbourhoods. I used to spend Sunday afternoons playing at bullfighting. With an old rag for a cape and a rusted iron weapon for a sword. Hey, toro! Ol?! And even then I had my public. The rest of the week I worked in the market. My work was hard and boring. And my future could have been this... or this. At night I used to help my mother sell tacos and quesadillas on a corner in San Juan de Letr?n. Let's see, give me one with chorizo and salsa. Yes, sir. It's hot. Here, kid. It's not enough. Listen, sir, it's another five. Here you are, go on! That's how I learned the value of money and how hard it is to earn. On the other hand, if I were a bullfighter... Bulls are dangerous but hunger hurts you more. Years passed. And from working so hard I almost forgot about the bulls. Until one day in a bullpen near Nonoalco. I saw Valent?n for the first time. D'you want fight a bull? Hold on. Alright then, take this. Let's see. Call him, Hands down, steady. No, not like that Give it here. Come with me. Pay attention. If you don't know what you're doing, look what can happen to you. All those scars are from serious gorings. Would you like to be like that? I'll teach you, look. Valent?n was a justa beginner, fighting young bulls. But for me, he was a titan. A master who taught me all he knew. - D'you get it? - Yes, I do, now. - Your turn. Dig your heels in since the bulls come at you with force. Stand your ground. Show him where to go. No, don't lift your hands so much. Have him come closer to you. Closer, closer. Make him stick to you. Once more. And do it again. Yes, yes, just like that. That's it. I went back there every day. So anxious to learn that I wore out my shoes. We didn't have anything to eat. But we fooled hunger with a cigarette. Let's go, little bull. Come on, once more. Come on. Valent?n was tireless. And his biggest challenge was to show me how to manage the cape with my left hand. Toro! Toro, let's go. Bullfighting is a splendid art he used to say. But it's the only art where you pay for mistakes with your life. I didn't pay much attention to him because I didn't yet know what fear was. We went from the bull pen to a real bullring. You're here with your sticks and here is the bull. This is your trajectory and this is the bull's. When you meet, lift your arms up. Let's go. Leave it to me. Let's go. Here he comes. Come on. Come on. Confront him, face to face. Get away from the bull, come on. After that thrust I thought I was the greatest of all bullfighters. Next to the barriers I dreamed that wearing a suit of lights, I would see thousands of handkerchiefs waving at me. And thousands of voices shouting out to me: Torero! What a bullfighter! Hey, Luis. Come on. And yet I had never really seen an actual bull up close. And Valent?n decided it was time. Come on, climb up here. We travelled in a Pullman and there was plenty of food. It didn't take long to get to the ranch where Lorenzo Garza was holding trials. Not here, the stick has to hit the centre. and must cross the other tip. The animal is over there, and you're here. And the bull is going to go through there like a train. - Is he going to fight? - Of course. It's one of yours, Lorenzo! Come on, little one. Watch out for your left hand, bullfighter! Ol?! Ol?! Ol?! That's how it's done! - My dear Monterey! - I want to see some energy! Look how he holds his hand! With a hand like that you get rich! At night, with the other young bullfighters, we went to the pasture looking for bulls. We had to take risks. - They're over there. - Shh... don't shout. If they get hold of us, they'll hurt us. Bulls that are provoked learn from experience and will kill anyone. "No entry on pain of death" Don't make a sound. They're huge, buddy. This one looks good but he's really close. Let?s try him. Be very careful. Careful Valent?n. Be careful. Take this. Toro! Come on, toro! Enough already, Leave him. - Force him. - Toro, toro! Come on, you ugly beast! Let's go, they've seen us already. Hey! You idiots! There they go! Here they come. Idiots! Morons!! Run! We lost confidence and went back to the city. But, that feeling of hearing the bull snorting, and being near the tip of a horn would be impossible for me to forget. But, there was no way! I had no option. I went back to the market to work hard. Very hard. In order to pay a crude manager who used to help young bullfighters, if we paid him instead of getting paid. You can get good fish here! Fish! Agreed. My first contract. Even though I paid out money rather than receiving any, it was my first contract. - Good luck. - Thank you. How beautifully the sun shone that Sunday. For the first time, I thought, like all bullfighters:" I hope there's no wind" The stockings, the shoes, the bullfighter's pants were all rented, but what did it matter, it was my first suit of lights. Everyone admired me. And my mother seemed calm. While I received my very first ovation. What a feeling it was to share the bullring with other young bullfighters as full of hope as I was. The public was waiting, skeptical, indifferent. Look. Let's go. Hey, toro! Let's go. - He's very restrained. - Let's wait and see what he does. Get closer, don't be lazy. Hey, toro, let's go. He's scared. Make him pass close to you! Oh, get out of here! Go home, you coward, you jerk! - What's he doing? - He needs to pay attention. Torero! Torero! I was wounded. And my self-esteem was wounded. I was lucky. Valent?n reminded me that in the bullring you had to fight two enemies. The bull and the public. How right he was! That was the last piece of advice he gave me. A few weeks later, a bull he provoked, killed him in Jalisco. Poor Valent?n. I continued my fights from bull to bull from town to town, Until one day, the rancher Don Fernando de la Mora. invited me to his ranch and gave me a calf to amuse his friends with. I was lucky. I caught the attention of the photographers and the journalists liked me. The rancher recommended me to the manager of the main bullring, Don Antonio Algara. They're two phenomenons, Luis Briones the best fighter of young bulls in the world. And Luisito Procuna, who will give him a run for his money as soon as he can. No way! Algara contracted us to fight together. The bullring was full, Briones was the bullfighter of the day and everyone applauded him. No one paid any attention to me. The first bull of the afternoon was for Briones. Be careful, don't move him, I think he's hurt. Leave him, can't you see he's groggy. Take him away quickly. For the public, the bullfight was over. But, since they had paid to come in, they stayed to see what I could do. So there they were once again, indifferent, serious, annoyed and impatient. Get it over with, we don't want to see you! Stop clowning around and fight! Get him out of here! Go and learn at home! Throw him out! Throw him out! =The kid's pretty good, leave him alone. for goodness sake! That's the way! The knowledgeable ones could see that nothing had happened to me. and they began to enjoy the fight. Toro! Ah, ah, ah, look! Hopefully he'll be lucky with the cape. Ol?, come on. There! - Careful with the banderilla. - Watch him stick them in! Ol?, they're good bulls. I had won them over. And my first fanfare was played. - Thanks a lot. - Bravo, long live handsome bullfighters! Thank you. Critics and producers were all around my manager. Contracts rained down and my name became known. I was among the most important fighters of young bulls. And journalists hung on my every word. No, you'll excuse me when I toast my girlfriend, Paco. For you, Consuelo, queen of my heart. I adored her and fortunately I triumphed. Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. That season was a series of triumphs. Until the biggest day of all, the day I became a true bullfighter. Luis Castro "the soldier" gave me the matador's equipment. Finally I achieved my greatest dream. After so much suffering, I was a true bullfighter. I lowered my head to hide my emotion. The money wasn't important to me. I had conquered the greatest enemy. The public. It was worth being a bullfighter just to hear such an ovation. I had to learn how to wear a tuxedo to receive the trophy for the season. And afterwards, I was able to fulfil a sacred promise. To build a monument for my mother's tomb with my savings. To think that while she was alive, I couldn't even buy her a cheap pair of shoes. I missed her so much on my wedding day. I would so much have liked to have her at my side. Make way! Long live the newly-weds! What more could I want. I was married to Chelito. I had money in the bank and everyone wanted to see me fight. I didn't even think about the danger, Fear and death... were for others, not for me. And that's when I went to Mexico City. The monster from C?rdoba Manuel Rodr?guez "Manolete" is getting off the plane which brought him to Mexico. Make way, please make way! - Friends and public... - I feel very happy. have come en masse to welcome him. Long live Spain! I feel the affection of all Mexicans. Long live Mexico! When they opened the Plaza Mexico the biggest bullring in the world. I took turns with Manolete in front of 50.000 fans. Chelito this is for you and hopefully I'll be lucky! I felt very proud cutting off the ears of that bull in front of him. I observed him, doubting that he had the skill everyone talked about. The impassioned public, didn't want to admit that a foreigner, a Spaniard, could be better than a Mexican. Ol?! Ol?! But Manolete triumphed. Manolete was a master. How had he managed it? Ol?! Ol?! By the following Sunday, Manolete was earning 20.000 dollars per fight. And people were pawning everything just to go to the bullring. I, with Arturo, my new manager, also went to see the monster from C?rdoba. He never smiled. Nevertheless, his dignified and solemn figure captivated the public. Did you realize? He took something off all the bulls. With the perfection of his artistry. And when he wasn't able to triumph he gave even more of himself and... Leave him, leave him. Here, take this. I suddenly realized that the bullfighter has three enemies. The bull, the public and the bullfighter himself. And that was the enemy that Manolete had conquered. His own fear. The ears! I understood his greatness and I admired him, just as the public admired him, as they proclaimed him the best fighter of the season. For the best performance and the best afternoon's entertainment. Thank you very much. Finally Lolita del Rio, our biggest star, gave Manolete the coveted trophies and who knows how many hugs. How adorable! I would say that in Mexico even the gorings are pleasant... Manolete went back to Spain. But what a problem he left us with! The band is striking up a tune. We're all ready to watch something extraordinary... I soon had another hero to admire. He was a tiny little thing, but he was my son. - Congratulations, matador. - Thank you. - It's your best piece of work. - He looks like me, doesn't he? Yes, very much so. Ah, what a wonderful thing. Thank you. He has to be a bullfighter like his dad. Isn't that what should happen? A bullfighter? No, I hope to God he won't be. How could I show Chelito, my wife, my happiness with this gift? In Mexico we say these things through songs. Today since it's your saint's day We will sing to you. Wake up my sweet, wake up Look it's already dawn and the birds are singing. The moon has left. How beautiful the morning is Did you bring them for me? Today I've come to greet you For you, my love. Come up here, come on. We all came with pleasure and are happy to congratulate you From the stars in the sky I have to take two down One to greet you, and the other to say goodbye. - Does it seem like the first time? - Yes, we seem like sweethearts. With jasmin and other flowers I've come to greet you today. Since it's your saint's day, we have come to sing to you. The art and integrity of Manolete. Inspired an extraordinary young bullfighter in Mexico. Joselillo. He got in very close just like the public wants us all to do. We were great friends. And I watched him fight with a lot of anxiety. Poor Joselillo. Your fearless courage could only lead you... Here. You gave too much of yourself. And how quickly they'll forget you. One night, when I was waiting for a call from Madrid about a contract No. No. Yes. A bull had killed, the best, the greatest matador of all. I didn't want to believe it. It just wasn't possible. A friend sent me pictures of the tragedy that I needed to see on my own. The whole of Spain was in mourning. Accompanying a mother's grief. A Mexican bullfighter, Luis Castro, my sponsor, helped to carry Monolete's coffin Just like I had carried Joselillo's. Here. In this bullring just a week earlier. They had insulted him and thrown cushions at him yelling that he should get closer. Now, it was too late. They were all throwing flowers. My contracts in Spain were signed and I went to fulfil them. I fought in the Madrid bullring. Jesus! Hey, toro, hey, toro. Out! Out! everybody out! The cape, give me the cape! Get out! - Take cover! Get out! - You can't do it! He's got your number. - Leave me alone! - But, Luis. - Stop now, get out! And so my season in Spain finished with blood and applause.. I didn't want to go back to Mexico without visiting my friend. Manolete. For the first time an idea struck me. If a bull had killed him, why couldn't it happen to me one day. How do you feel? I'm better now. How are the kids? - Good. - Look at the camera. - Thank you. - You're welcome. =They're waiting for you at home. You're looking great! I was still recuperating but I had several contracts to fulfil. And I put myself through some rigourous training, to get some strength back in my ruined muscles. There, in the same bullring, as I had begun. A new generation was coming up trying to push us out. They were calling me " Master" now. And I soon thought it would be easy to go back to fighting. Hey, toro! This can't be happening! I've got him! I've got him! This can't be, gentlemen! You're robbing us blind, get out! Closer, get closer... Closer, get closer! Get in there! What was happening to me? I was scared. Very scared and they wanted more. What shall I do, blessed virgin, what shall I do?. Get in there! Procuna, why won't you get closer? Closer! Closer! Get in closer for goodness sake! Come on, let's go! Many days later. They gave me the big goring. Iodine. Oxygen, more oxygen. Thank you. The wound healed over but the pain didn't go away. Listening to my kids ?laughter, I thought perhaps I wouldn't live to see them grow up. What did I need? Didn't I have everything? I would get away from bulls... for a season. I took it easy, enjoyed life. Enjoyed fresh air and sunshine with no risk. I read and I travelled. There were so many things I had never taken the time to learn. - That's Luis Procuna. - Yes. But even here, admiring Goya, I ran into them once again. Furious bulls, The brutal charge. The bloody goring. I couldn't forget them. I carried them with me. I wanted to see them again. - How do they seem to you? - I like that one. They're all magnificent! Just like this, from a distance, is how I wanted to see them. Knowing that they weren't for me. Yes, it was better to have fancy clothes dancing and partying. And to forget. Drink up, buddy! Drink up. It's good, isn't it? Yes, it's good. Delicious, isn't it? Let's go, buddy The cowboys are coming to the competition. The cowboys are coming to the competition. Scratching their dusty horses. With shining spurs and well dressed in their leathers. The cowboys are coming to the competition. They are coming to begin competing. Keep dancing! The young bulls are coming, The horses are snorting He's shy! Spotted young bull. Fierce young bull. Make him run, make him run, make him go further. Spur him on my horse, spur him on. Give it to him! That's what I like to see, long live the women from my country! - Ay, ay, ay, beautiful young woman. - Hey toro! We can already ride you, bull. We've got your measure, bull I'm going to hold you down you like you deserve. That's how I run in the meadow knowing where I'm going to send you You little bull, I can ride you. The cowboys are coming to start the competition. The young bulls are there. The horses are snorting. Spotted young bull. Fierce young bull. Make him run, push him hard. You're my dark-skinned prize, I want a prisoner. Spur him on, spur him on. Give it to him! Put out his lights! When I got back to the city, I wanted to buy my wife a gift. I had a lot of money and I liked spending it. I got these bracelets ready, Se?or Procuna. This is the one I prefer, Chelito. Do you like it? It's exquisite. But it will be very expensive. It's for Se?ora Procuna. This is the life. No bulls, no public, no fear. - I'd like to see you fight. - Me. - Yes. - Bulls. The bulls... Eh, for... for me... they don't like me. - Let's drink to that. - Cheers! Perhaps I would never fight again. Hey, Arturo, what's new? This. Look. Let's see. "Procuna now a millionaire and running scared, should retire." What do you think? But, why do they say such things? The public says I'm afraid to go back to bullfighting. The public is in charge, yes. And I owe them everything. But in exchange didn't I give them my youth. Why can't I retire if I want to? - He retired out of fear. - Yes, he's hiding away in his house. Procuna won't even wear his suit of lights to have his picture taken. - I always knew it. - Sure, and I always supported him. Look what it says here! Today's paper! Today's paper! With Procuna's retirement! It's a given that we can't count on Luis Procuna for the next season. And it's better for the fans because Luis is.. so desperately scared that he won't go out except if you pay him. He'll jump head first into the gully after the parade. Luis Procuna is a bullfighter dominated by fear. And with fear, gentlemen, you can't be in the bullring. Yes, I'm scared. Just thinking about getting close to a bull makes the stitches of my gorings hurt. It's true that I'm afraid. And it's also true that I have enough money to not die here. Crushed like a beast of burden. To never again have to live in the poverty I was born into. So, what did I want? To triumph just to be rich. Why had I fought so much? Why? Just so I wouldn't have to live where my mother lived and died. I've achieved all my dreams. I'm rich and famous. Why am I not happy? Look at me, take this! Look at me, let's go, toro! Let's go! Think about it, but I don't think you should let them keep on talking. About whether Procuna does this, or Procuna does that. I'll do whatever you want but... you're going risk your life every Sunday while they're calling you scared and cowardly. Coward! I have to make a decision and to face up to reality. I'm not a coward! I have to be alone in the bullring once more. I have to conquer the bull. Conquer the public and vanquish my fear. To know that I'm the strongest of the three. That's why I want to fight. That's why I want to live. That's why I'm here. The front row seats are completely full. There's such a crowd there's not room for one more single soul. How are you Luis? Good luck! How's it going? Just like always. Good luck, Luisito. Thank you, thank you. Thanks everyone. Virgin of Guadalupe, please let me go home to my children. Protect me, my Lady. Let's go up there, boys. We can see the bullfighters from there. The three of them are at the door in a group The three stars who are on the program this afternoon. Three extraordinary personalities, who are fighting together for the first time in Mexico. "The man from Portugal" Manolo Dosantos. "The Cyclone" Carlos Arusa. And "The Pronghorn" Luis Procuna who's appearing again after a prolonged absence from the ring. Ladies and gentleman, good afternoon Yes, sir! It's only a few minutes until the trumpets sound and the public starts to have a really good time. Over there in the sun, the classic sombrero is being tossed. Dosantos, in his golden year, is fighting like an angel. With such ease, such grace, such steadiness, such astonishing elegance! Very good, isn't he? He really fights well. Dosantos is an idol for the public. - Did you see how he fights? - Fantastic! Let him go, let him go! Arusa is irresistible. Intimidating, invincible! Hating other people's triumphs, wanting the most acclaim for himself. Marvellous and masterly at every stage of the fight. A unique banderiller0, quite extraordinary. He's like a mad dog with the cape. Determined to overcome his opponents. Putting himself within two millimetres of the tips of the horns, Hey! Careful! 50.000 fans cheer this terrific bullfighter on one of his glorious afternoons. And now it's Procuna's turn. A very boisterous fighting bull jumped straight into the gully. But Procuna is not having one of his most inspired days. Visibly out of shape. Taking it too carefully. You can hear what they think! It seems that he's going to have one of his frequent bad afternoons. You piece of crap! The sword! Give me the cape! Procuna, don't run yet! Procuna, get in close to him! That's enough Procuna! Gentlemen it's just not right! Get out! You'd better leave! Trying to get out the way Procuna gets a horrible puncture wound. Go away, you coward, get out! And the indignation builds. The anger becomes organized and takes on gigantic proportions. "Attention, attention, please" "The Judge has declared that the bullfighter, Luis Procuna. "For his pathetic performance. Will be fined the amount of 5.000 pesos." Come on, don't pay any attention to them. Well my friends, that's the end of the bullfight. And the end of a career for a bullfighter who was an idol. Who was great and greatly loved. But who has lost his way, his courage and his sense of shame. Procuna you're a thief! You're despicable, you're vile! Come on, what are we waiting for? Let's go! Just a moment, something's happening, Procuna is talking to his people. Let's see what it's all about. - How are the reserve bulls? - There's one really good one. O.K. go ask for it. - Can I offer you one? - Yes. He wants another one. Shall we give it to him? Sure. One. Another one, come on. Let go of him. "Attention, attention. The skilled Luis Procuna, is giving us a bull. Luis Procuna, is giving us a bull." Leave him to me. The bull bravely charges at a picador. And we see an emotional Luis Procuna leading the bull away in timely fashion. With beautiful, artistic moves. Ol?! - Water, water. - Let's see. Let the doctor see you. It's nothing, there's nothing the matter. Come on. Calm down, Luis, calm down, let's go. Chamaquito! And now Procuna is toasting the judge who just fined him. For you. He takes the cape in his right hand And goes to find the bull. He's glued to one spot in the ring, completely alone. He's slow and elegant. And now, with his left hand. Mexico has got it's idol back. It's favourite bullfighter. Torero! Torero! Torero! Torero! Wait for him here. My love. I'm with my family again. But, what about next Sunday...
