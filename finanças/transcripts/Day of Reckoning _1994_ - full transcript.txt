(MultiCom Jingle) (slow mellow music) - Whoo, hi, did y'all have fun? - Oh, it was fantastic, you should've been there. - Looks like you missed quite a party. - Well, somebody's got to mind the store. Oh, look sugar, we all got to do our part. - [Man] How you doin'? - [Woman] Okay. - Well, hi there. - Who's the blond in the pink thing? - You know, I wouldn't have taken her for your type. - [Sam] There you go. - [Woman] Oh, why thank you, Commissioner. - [Woman] Great, commissioner. - All right. - Hi, Melissa, hey. - My, my, my, looks like somebody's been busy. - [Tommy] How you doin'? - Hi, Tommy. - You guys have a good time? - [Both] Uh huh. - [Tommy] Did y'all have a good weekend, Commissioner? - Oh, I think you could safely say that, Tommy. (feet thud) Looks pretty solid, I think your boys are doing a fine job. - [Tommy] Glad to be of service. - Tommy. - Wiley, looks like you had a good time. - [Sandra] Last call. - Can I help? - Would you like to pour the juice? - Yeah. - Thank you, sweetheart. - [Sandra] Shane, I'm not kiddin, I can't be late, come on. - I'm not hungry. - [Sharon] Well, just eat a bite. - [Shane] Mom, I'm not hungry. - Good job. - Are you excited Mommy? - Um, I'm more kinda nervous, you know, sweetheart. - It's only a job, Mom. - Yeah, but it's a good job, and we need every penny. - Hey, don't blame me. - Shane, look, this is important for me, okay? It could lead someplace, could help us get outta here. - [Shane] Yeah, right. - We'll talk about it tonight, all right, Shane? I don't have time now. Shane, will you walk your sister to the bus stop? - Yeah. - Y'all have a good day. I left the phone number on the refrigerator. I want you to call me when you get home from school. I saw you take your sister's lunch. Bye. - Hey, Mom? - Mm hmm. - Good luck today. - Thank you, Shane. (doorbell rings) - How you doing? - [Sam] Now you won't forget me when you're back up there in Washington, right? - Forget you, Commissioner? My heart may be in Washington, but my pocketbook will always be in Georgia. (all chuckle) (knocking on door) - [Sam] Oh yeah, come in Tommy. - Commissioner, Sheriff, Senator. - How's the work going? - Uh, the dock's finished, sir. The boys'll need another couple of weeks on the boat. - Mm, there's no hurry. You can give the boys some time off. Oh, I want you to buy your little league team some new uniforms. Send me the bill. That'll be all, Tommy. - Thank you very much, sir. - Your birthday's coming up, Sam. And well, me and the boys would like to show our abide and appreciation. - [Sam] Now that won't be necessary, Sheriff. Harris Wiley already has something planned. - [Harris] Just tell him I'm gonna need these back by this afternoon, okay? - Why certainly, Harris. Beth, hon, you're just too pretty to be workin' like a little ole bee. - Any messages there, sweetie? - [Beth] Oh yeah, a whole bunch, here you go. - [Audrey] Hi, Melissa. Be a real sweetheart and pick up my dry cleaning, will ya? - Yeah, I'll do it during my, my break. (phone rings) Department of Labor. Audrey, for you. - By tomorrow, hon. These are the time sheets for Audrey's department. They worked here all last week. - Sure thing. - [Sandra] Melissa sure works you to death. - [Beth] Give her a week and she'll start in on ya. - Let me know if I can help you. - I don't wanna get you into trouble. - Melissa? - Be careful, Sandra. Those time sheets, the ones for Audrey and Susan? - Yeah? - They were playing in the Bahama's last week. Welcome to the labor department. - Oh, Beth has a little girl named Theresa. I think you're older than she is. - Was it fun? - Well, it's my first day. I'm sure I'll learn to like it. I mean I have to, won't I? Shane, Shane, you have homework. - [Shane] Just wait up a sec. - No, come on, you've been in there a couple of hours. Oh, oh, let me take a look. - [Shane] No. - [Sharon] Oh, come, Shane, let me see. - [Shane] No. - [Sharon] Please sweetheart, just let me take a look at 'em. - Get a life, mom, okay? - Ah. Oh. - You're gonna wrinkle 'em. - Shane, these are good. You have an eye. - Yeah, thanks, mom. I appreciate it. Just don't, uh, show these to dad, okay? - Shane, he's your father. (door thuds) - The Wiley Lumber Company appreciates your business. Sincerely, Harris Wiley, President of Wiley Lumber. Come on. And make sure you type that up on lumber company letterheads, sweetheart. Don't use the labor department stationary, okay? - Um, Tommy Marchant. You must be Sandra Clayton? - Yes, sir. - Well, no, he's the sir, I'm just Tommy. Welcome to the zoo. - Tommy, I'm gonna buy big Sam a new Buick for his birthday. Thank you, honey. - Well, now, boys just kicked in for the new dock. - I want you to collect $50 from each of the men. - Sam needs a new car like George needs another peanut farm. - Well, that's fine Tommy, if you wanna kiss 12 years in your pension goodbye. (Tommy sighs) Oh listen, I might have a little job for you on Saturday night. - It's the last damn time. (door thuds) - [Woman] Bye, see ya tomorrow. - [Melissa] Goodnight, y'all. - [Beth] Goodnight. - Here let me give you hand with these. - Thanks. - [Sharon] You gotta a lot of work to do. - Well, I'll just get it in the morning. Listen, I got something to do tomorrow night, would you mind sittin' Theresa? - [Sharon] Oh no, I'd love to. Shannon's dying to see her. - [Beth] Thanks. - You've got a date? - Uh, it's not exactly a date. I mean, well. - Excuse me, may I help you? - No, I know my way around. Don't I, Beth? - Hi. Sandra. - [Sandra] Yes, sir. - [Harris] See you Monday, okay? Come on, sweetie, let's go. - That's Barbara, she used to have your desk. - Is he like that with all the employees? - Old Harris has his own golden rule, what's yours is his. - [Sandra] Huh. - [Beth] So how 'bout having a drink with me? - Oh no, I'm sorry, I can't. I promised the kids. - Well, call and say you'll be late. - No, I really can't do it. They haven't seen me all week, you know. Something wrong there? - Oh no, I, it was just Melissa, she's... Just one drink? - [Melissa] Busy Saturday? - Yeah, Harris has got me running some fool errand. You know Harris. - Better than his own wife, sugar. (mid-tempo country music) Oh, that blond you were asking about? - [Tommy] Yeah? - [Melissa] Her name is Mary Ann, I checked. - Hey Tommy, come on over here for a minute, will you? - Cheat. - Sandra's son likes to fish, you know a good spot? - Sure, how you doin'? - Fine. - I'll draw you a map. Take Racetrack Road, turn left, follow that dirt road down there to the bridge, okay? - You didn't really have to bother. - No, it's no bother. Now you tell your boy, what's his name? - Shane. - Well, you tell Shane that the bass are in. - It's gettin' late Mr. Marchant, and Beth and I really hadn't even had a chance to talk. - Well, excuse me. - Why the brush off? He's nice, he's not one of them. - Ask him about the new Buick. - Everyone has to do their share for Caldwell. He doesn't have a choice. - Beth, honey, we all have a choice. - Yeah, I guess. (slow relaxing music) - Catch anything? - [Shane] No, not yet. - What you got in your line? - Nightcrawlers. - That's fine if you wanna catch catfish. Tommy Marchant, I work with your mom. - Oh, yeah? - Listen, uh, bass are hittin' silver Rapalas, you wanna try one? - [Sandra] Shane! Shane! - Yeah, but I gotta go. - [Sandra] Shane, come in Shane. - Uh, my mom made some chicken. You wanna have some? - Well, sure, thank you kindly. Meet you up there by the bank. (boat motor revs) - [Shane] Hey, mom. - [Sandra] Uh huh. - [Shane] Look who's here. - How you doin'? - Say hello to Mr. Marchant, honey. - Hello, Mr. Marchant. - Well, my friends call me Tommy, honey. - Okay, Tommy honey. - Hey, you got a couple of good lookin' kids. Can I help you with something? - [Sandra] No, thank you, I'm just fine. - It must be tough raising them alone though, huh? Beth told me you're divorced. - Oh, yeah? What else did Beth tell you? - Did I say something wrong? Because if I did, I'd like to know what it is. - Listen, I overheard your conversation with Mr. Wiley. That business about Mr. Caldwell's new car. - So? - So, I guess one more shakedown won't hurt Georgia none. - [Tommy] Hey, now wait a minute. I don't have a choice here, I'm getting close to my pension. I'm gonna think twice before I throw it away. - Seemed like to me you had plenty of time to think twice. - Well, aren't you brave with other people's jobs. - I bet you knew about Audrey and Susan and that trip to the Bahamas. - Well, who signed the timecards? - Melissa told me to, I didn't know. - No, no, maybe not when you signed 'em. What about later on? Yeah, okay? This whole thing goes way beyond a couple call girls and a shakedown for a new Buick. - Well, how can you just do nothing. I know-- - No, you don't know. And that's the problem. (slow serious music) - My kids are hungry. - [Beth] Here we go, here we go. - [Sandra] You look gorgeous. - Thanks. - The guy's gonna melt. - Boy, you're real good at this. - I wanted to be a florist, work with beautiful things. - Why didn't you? - Oh, you know, got married, had children, got divorced. Old story. - Yeah, I know that one. - [Sandra] At least this brings in a little extra money. (slow piano music) - Well, I guess I better get goin', huh? - Beth, relax, it's a date not an execution. God (chuckles). - You take good care now, sweetheart. Bye. - Have fun. (slow ominous music) - Come on, Mitchell, can't this wait till morning? - [Mitchell] No. - What you smiling for? Oh, no, Mitchell. - Oh yeah, Tommy. - Come on, man, we get caught moving this stuff, we're-- - Then we don't get caught, do we? (doorbell rings) (slow elegant music) - My, my, my, you look pretty as myrtle. All right, now don't be nervous, sugar. Derek, just a little boy dressed up in a suit is all. There you are. Beth, this is Derek. Derek's real big, honey. He's an auditor from Atlanta. Derek, honey, I think this little girl needs a drink. - It'll be my pleasure. Come on, let me introduce you to some of these stuffed shirts. (slow unsettling music) - [Tommy] Mitchell! (police radio chatters) - [Officer] Kinda late to be out here, isn't it? - Yes, sir, I just. - Won't you climb down from there, nice and easy, and we'll sort this out. Let's see what you got here. Well. - [Mitchell] Hi, Woody. - Is that you, Mitchell? - Just cleaning a little old business up for Sam. - Be sure and tie it down. We don't want any public safety hazard. Oh, hey, say hello to the commissioner for me, will ya? - Don't worry, he won't forget ya. See Tommy, I told you, you worry too much. (slow uneasy music) - Now, honey, you just got to learn to relax a little bit, that's all. - Look, I don't feel so good. I gotta go. (slow ominous music) - Come here, darlin'. Fantastic ole Derek is here, huh, make you feel good, huh. - [Beth] No, (screams) no! (dress rips) (whimpers and cries) (phone rings) - Hello? Yes, this is she. - [Intercom] Dr. Baker to pediatrics. (knocking on door) Dr. Baker to pediatrics. - Hi. Oh Beth, honey. (slow somber music) - Where's Theresa? Is she okay? - Mm hmm, she's asleep, Shane's watching her. - I feel so ashamed. - Shh. - I didn't want to. Melissa said they'd fire me if I didn't. - If you didn't what, Beth? - You know, entertain the customers. - Oh, Beth, no, that's not your fault. (Beth sobs) The police will-- - There's no police, no. - Oh Beth, we've got to report this. - No, I'm not going back. You can't stop them, Sandra. I'm sorry, you can't stop them. - Shh, it's okay. - It's not okay, it won't be okay. They'll be after you next. - [Harris] We'll let you know as soon as we get it all figured out. - [Woman In Red] Fine Mr. Wiley. - Thank you. Who's next? - She's the last one. It's not easy to find a girl who measure up, sugar. - [Harris] (chuckles) Well, keep working on it, we're gonna have to find a replacement for Beth by the end of the week, hm. Oh, listen, honey. - [Melissa] Yeah. - I'm gonna have to raise the rent around here. - [Melissa] Didn't you just rewrite that lease six months ago. - Oh, well, I suppose Derek that big ole auditor up in Atlanta is gonna raise a real ruckus, huh? - Two more. - [Sandra] Oh, can't these wait? - [Melissa] Sorry, hon. - I really need to get home. - Well, then you better shake a bun, hon. (Sandra sighs) - [Barbara] Melissa. - Must be nice to get paid for doing nothin'. - I'd hardly call Harris nothin'. (both chuckle) Bye. (typewriter clicks) - Hey, mom, hurry up, mom. - Coming, honey. Nice of you to help Beth with the move. - Yeah, well, I played football with her brother. I've known her since she was a kid. It's the least I could do. - [Shannon] Mom, hurry up. - Listen, down by the river the other day, I'm sorry for what I said. - You were right. What happened to Beth goes beyond a couple of call girls and a new Buick. - Listen, they got this whole state wired. Hell, I know a congressman that called Caldwell sir. - You know why my marriage failed? 'Cause I didn't fight for it. I didn't stand up until it was too late. - Don't be so hard on yourself. - Learned a lesson. Problems don't just disappear. - Maybe Caldwell isn't just a lousy marriage. - [Shannon] Hey, mom. - I'm comin', honey. Yeah, but if I run away from every fire, what kind of lesson would I be teaching my kids? - [Shannon] Mom, hurry up. (slow stirring music) - Good night, Sandra. - Good night. (slow tense music) (Shane whimpers) (knocking on door) Shane, you okay? It's just a bad dream, sweetheart. - I'm okay. - You wanna talk about it? - Why should you care? - Shane? - You know, all you care about is that stupid job. - Shane, I'm doing the best I can. - Just leave me alone. - We'll do more things together, I promise. - They're beautiful. - Mm mm, who's the happy man, honey? - Mr. Thursday night. - [Woman] Thank you, sir. - Sandra, you know you're working too hard. She needs to get out more, don't you all think? Maybe take a cruise or something. You need me, I'll be at the lumber yard. - Be smart hon, you're sittin' on a gold mine. It's not gettin' any smaller. (slow unsettling music) - [Audrey] Sandra, be a real sweetheart and get a pitcher for those, will ya? - [Sandra] Thank you. - Tell me, honey. - [Tommy] Hmm. - You been in my desk again? - Yeah, I'm sorry, Melissa, I had to get a couple contracts. - Well, you know the rule, sugar, you ask me next time you wanna get into my drawers. - So I made a mistake. - [Tommy] What in the hell did you think you were doin'? - Just borrowing the key. - [Tommy] For what? - Make some copies. - [Tommy] Of what? - Mr. Wiley's lease, Melissa's personnel records, and those phony time sheets. Thanks for covering for me. You were really good. Sugar, next time you wanna get in my drawers. - And what in the hell you plan to do with all that good stuff? - I don't rightly know. Somebody's gotta hear about it, I thought maybe take it to the newspapers. - Forget it, Caldwell's got friends all over. Isn't gonna be too likely to print anything against the man. You can not beat these boys, Sandra. Okay, you cannot win. - Well, there's a big difference between not winning and not trying. - And there's a big difference between taking a good shot and shootin' from the hip. You wanna beat Caldwell, you need a pile of evidence. - I'll get it, and I'll go to the papers. - We could. Maybe there's a better way. (slow tense music) Let's try this. (grunts) All right, get up. Check it out. Can you get up? - [Sandra] No. - [Tommy] All right, just grab a handful, that's all we need You ready? - [Sandra] Yeah. - Go slow. - Okay. - All right. - Wait, wait, wait. - [Tommy] On three. - [Sandra] Wait, my left foot. - [Both] One, two, three. - [Sandra] Oh, oh my. - [Tommy] You all right? (Sandra thuds) - [Sandra] Oh! - You okay? - Yeah. - [Tommy] All right, here, take this, meet me around the side, open up the door. - [Sandra] Tommy. (tense dramatic music) - Sandra. Get down. (clanking) (door thuds) - [Sandra] I'm going with ya. - No, too risky. - How can it be risky if you trust the guy? - Yeah, well, but what if he is one of them? No reason for us both to get burned. - [Sandra] Shane, what are you doing up? - What's in the bag? - Nothin', go on, get back to bed. - Where'd you get it from? - Back to bed, Shane. - Shane, the only thing that you have to know is that I'd never let anything happen to your mom. - Humph. - [Sandra] Night, sweetheart. - [Shane] Goodnight, mom. (slow gentle music) (slow foreboding music) - Hey, buddy, got a problem under the hood there? - [Tommy] There you are, where the hell you been? - Come on, let's see what you got, Tommy. - Check it out. - Looks like the genuine article to me. - You think that'll do? - [Leroy] Ought to. - We know the weeds there now, but we don't know how long it's there for, so I think we ought to move fast. - I understand. - You know, 'cause I'm kinda hangin' out on a limb with this thing here, Leroy. You know, Caldwell's got-- - He's got a sale with his name on it. Look, don't you worry none. This is between you, me, and the narc squad, all right? - All right. - [Sam] Gentlemen, we have a problem. Sheriff. - You're up to your ass in river mud, boy. - Hmm, what do you mean? - Your damn barrels of weed, that's what I mean. Hell, you left a trail so wide, a blind coon dog could follow it. (wheezes) - What happened? - What happened? Somebody told the police about your little old schoolhouse. - Oh no, come on now. You sure, I helped Mitchell unload that stuff, wasn't anybody around. - Well, welcome to the graveyard, boy. They start poking, one old skeleton is gonna lead right to another. - Harris? - I didn't, uh-- - You didn't think, that's what you didn't do. You were careless and you were stupid. - Sam, if there's a-- - [Sam] Don't Sam me! - Yes, sir. - I don like unhappy workers. I wanna know who talked, I wanna know why, and I wanna it stopped. (thunder roars) (slow tense music) - Sure this is where he said? - Yeah, I'm sure. Well, here, ask him yourself. What's going on? - Forget about Caldwell, Tommy. He's not touchable. - What are you saying? - The investigation's closed. The evidence is gone. - What? - I'm out of it, Tommy, been pulled off the case. - Well, great, that's great. So they know about me? - Not by me, that's for damn sure. But I tell you, if they sniff me out, they could get to you too. So if I was y'all, I'd just forget this whole damn thing. Lay low and keep quiet till this thing blows over. - Damn, thing's not gonna blow over. - No, it's not. - Just lay low and forget about the whole thing? - Well, I tell ya, if we keep going, we won't have anywhere to go for help. - I know. - Why us? I mean we're just a weekly. The Constitution, they're a daily. They're big, they got teeth. - We tried that. We talked to some guy, next thing you know, he's transferred out of state. - Could be a coincidence. - You really believe that? - We didn't know where else to go. We have plenty more where this came from. - Why not just take it to the police? - Already did. - [Albert] And? - Caldwell got to him. - David we'll need to have access to other sources. - We'll arrange it. - All right, I'll try to protect you and the sources, but there's no guarantee. - You know Caldwell better than I do, how do you think he'd react to all this? Remember, Georgia has swamps. - Well, sources have been known to just disappear. - We'll take our chances. - [Beth] I can't, Sandra. - [Sandra] He promises he won't use your name. - That won't stop Caldwell from finding out, it'll just slow him down. - Beth, by the time he finds out, it'll be too late. - I can't, Sandra. - Beth, remember that night how you felt? Remember when I came to see you in the hospital, Theresa didn't almost have a momma at all. - I just wanna make it up to Theresa. I wanna be a good mother. - I don't want my kids growing up in a world where people like Caldwell can do whatever they wanna do, and everybody's too scared to even say anything. - It's right to be scared. - Beth, Tommy and I are gonna do this. We can't do it alone. - I don't know. (slow subdued music) - [Sandra] Just talk to him. - [Beth] Each office has at least one, always young, always attractive. They use them to win new friends, and blackmail and reward. They pass women around like a piece of candy. Caldwell has a special place up in Harriet's Bluff where he invites his female employees to entertain high-ranking officials. This isn't an isolated incident. It's almost common practice. - That ought to grab Caldwell's attention. - They can't do this. - [Attorney] Oh, it's called freedom of the press. - Freedom, my ass, I'll shut 'em down. - Try it, you'll give them an even bigger headline. - Well, hell, it's just some two-bit podunk rag. - Sam, it'll all blow over. Now as your attorney, my advice, let it be. - Well, my advice is sue 'em, do something, find out where this dribble is coming from. I'll be damned if I'm just gonna let it be. (camera clicks) - [Man] Howdy, senator. - [Bo] I really appreciate these labor department volunteers. - [Sam] Now they are gonna make you the best known face in Georgia, Bo - [Bo] Are you sure, Commissioner? - Oh, well, maybe, maybe the second best known face. (camera clicks) Now Harris, we're not gonna read about this in the newspaper, now are we? - [Harris] Sam, you couldn't find this place with a map. - Uh, how many people knew about your work on Bo Denton's campaign? - Maybe 20, Commissioner. - Hell, Sam, could be more than one rooster crowing. - I'm not in the could be business. - Well, I'd say whoever he is, he's inside the coop. He knows where the eggs are. - Well, sir, I could make a guess if I had to. - Well, you have to, so guess. (slow gripping music) (Tommy grunts) - It's only a message. If they were sure, I'd be dead. - At least we know they read The Gazette. - Gotta feed The Gazette at least one more story. Otherwise they'll know it's me. - Next time it won't be just a message will it? - No, at least it doesn't look like they suspect you. - [Shane] What happened? - Uh, I had a little fire at my apartment. It's okay. - Didn't exactly hide 'em, mom. I heard you talking with Beth. (phone rings) - Hello? - [Man] Lucky you weren't in bed with your boyfriend. Look out the window. - [Shane] Leave my mom's car alone! - Shane! - [Shane] Get outta here, leave us alone! - [Sandra] Shane, oh, baby. You all right? (slow tense music) - [Shannon] Why are we in Tommy's car? Where's our car? - Somebody hit it last night, honey. We'll have it back soon. Tommy. - [Tommy] Hmm? - [Sandra] Y'all want hamburger? - [Shannon] I'm not hungry, mom. - Let's see if he stops. - [Sandra] Mm hmm. - Yep, he's stopping. All right, now, Shane. - [Shane] Huh? - You wanna get me a root beer? - [Shane] Oh, I thought we were gonna go get hamburger. - [Sandra] Honey, just come on, get out. - [Shane] Well, why? - [Tommy] Come on, get up darling. - [Sandra] Sweetheart, you wanna go to the ladies' room? - [Shannon] Do we have to? - [Tommy] No backtalk, darlin'. - [Sandra] Yes, darlin' we do. Here we go. - Hold it right there. Now mister, I don't know who you are or what you want, but I got a good shot at you. - Take it easy, Mr. Marchant, I'm a friend. (gun clicks) - Come forward, put your hands here on the hood. - My name is John Curtis, I'm with the FBI. - And how would I know that? - Look, I'm gonna move my hands real slow. I'm gonna open my coat and show you my badge. And you're gonna put that gun away, and we're gonna talk. Interesting reading. If even half of this stuff could be made to stick, these boys will go away for a long, long time. - How'd you find us? - Hey, we're the FBI. - Yeah, but if you can figure it out, so can Caldwell. - Yeah, I heard they tried to smoke you out. Seems like you all could use some help. - Why should we trust you? - Frankly, I don't think you have much choice. You are in pretty deep. - Yeah, so what do you want from us? - Enough evidence on Caldwell to shake up a grand jury. - [Sandra] What do I tell my son? - Nothing. - Come on now, Shane's no dummy, he knows that something's going on. - But he doesn't know who I am, and it's important that he doesn't find out. You just gotta go back to work as if nothing whatsoever has happened, just business as usual. Believe me, if they knew it was you Tommy, they'd have killed you. You just gotta stare 'em down. - [Harris] I hear you had a little accident. - It wasn't any accident, and you know it. - Well, if it wasn't an accident then I would say you're in a lotta trouble. - If Sam finds out you're hounding the wrong man you'll be in a lotta trouble. - I'm not so sure you're not the right man, Tommy. Melissa has a list of 15 names. I want you to collect $200 from each of 'em. - I'll double it. - Well, that oughta make Sam real happy. - Sorry to hear about your accident. If you need a place to stay, you let me know, sugar. - You watch where you flick your matches. (Beth and Sandra laugh) - Thanks for taking care of the kids. - [Beth] Oh, sure. What about you? - [Sandra] What about me? - It's hard not to notice. Come on, give. - Oh no (laughs), it's that obvious? Well, um, Tommy is nice, but I really don't think I'm his type with the kids and all, I just. - Don't fight it too hard, Sandra, not all men are jerks. - (laughs) I don't, stardust only falls the first time. After that, it's fear every step of the way. - [Beth] (laughs) I hear that. (slow gentle music) - [Tommy] Hi. - Tommy. - 106. - There's something I need to know. - What? - Well, it's about Melissa. Did you ever have a thing with her? - Would it make any difference if I had? - Yeah, maybe. - No, Sandra, I never did. I never did. You're not gettin' cold feet on me, are ya? - Well, I guess this is it, isn't it? - You're late. Have a seat, I think you're gonna enjoy this. - [Harris On Tape] Melissa has a list of 15 names. I want you to collect $200 from each of 'em. - [Tommy On Tape] I'll double it. - [Harris On Tape] Well, that oughta make Sam real happy. - We've had a wire in that office for a while. You all think you could get me a copy of that list? Nice work. Look, what I really need is to hear Caldwell asking for money. - Well, how do you plan to do that? He never comes to the office. - It's not easy to get a grand jury to indict a public official like Caldwell. We only get one shot. Look, Tommy, I got a little something here that might help you out. The recorder fits in your boot. The wire runs up your leg, you tape the little microphone to your chest. Works like a charm. - Sandra? - Nah uh. - [John] This is your call. - [MC] Testing, testing, one, two (microphone screeches), testing one, two, three. - Say, it's quite a turnout, Sam, even with the no-shows you're gonna clear $20,000 easy. Hi, darlin'. - Well, a couple of fine looking kids you got here. You enjoying your dinner? Are you? - What do you say? - All right. Fine looking boy, too, how are you? - Shane. - Yeah. - [MC] Let's give a round of applause for Commissioner Sam Caldwell. Come on, everybody. (audience cheers and applauds) - Hi, sugar. - Good crowd, lots of food. - Well, I didn't come here to eat, honey. - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for that warm reception. Thank you all for coming out here tonight. - Why don't we go jump in a lake, huh? - Listen darling, I'm working, you know that. - How come you don't ever wanna work on me? I bet we could get your mind on something a little more interesting than all those trucks. (gasps) Oh no, silly ole me. Oh, look what I done. Oh, you're all wet. - That's all right, come on. - [Melissa] Oh, my, my, all the drying off. Here, I'm gonna get you nice and dry. - [Tommy] No, hey, hey, hey, it's fine. - Tommy, what is that? - [Tommy] Come on, here. (slow dramatic music) - [Sam] So thank you all for your generous support. - Why Tommy I didn't know you had it in you. - Uh, listen, I know you probably didn't come here for the food, and I've already heard the Caldwell talk, so why don't we go for that swim? (audience cheers and applauds) (car engine whirs) (car door slams) (knocking on door) - Hey, it's me. - Oh. Hot date, huh? - Well, I don't know if I'd call it a date. - What would you call it? The last time I saw you were pretty wrapped up in your work. - Yeah, well, I figured I had a choice. You know, here I'd take Melissa out, or Mitchell will take me out, permanently. - She didn't find the wire, did she? - Well, yeah, she might of seen something. But she's so drunk I don't think she'll remember, you know. I mean she passed out before I got her home. I took her mind off it. - See if we can take your mind off her. - Yeah, that'll help. - You can't go back into work. - No, I gotta go right back in. I gotta go in like nothing happened whatsoever. - You can't, what if Melissa wasn't really so drunk? What if she does remember? - [Tommy] Yep. (slow intense music) (men chatter) - [Mitchell] I said let's go. In the car bigmouth, let's go. - [Man] FBI. - I need to speak to Special Agent Curtis, please. - [Man] Special Agent Curtis is not available just now. Would you care to leave a number where he could reach you? - Sandra? Honey, don't you have a phone at your desk? You know we're having a little party next week, and Mr. Wiley would like me to be sure that you're there. Now you don't wanna put me in a bad light do you? (slow tense music) - All right, get out of the car. You wanted to talk? Let's talk. (Melissa chuckles) - You got a big mouth, Tommy. - You knew about the marijuana, Harris, and the women and the tobacco barn, maybe it was you, maybe it was Mitch. - No, it was you, Tommy. Melissa saw the wire. - What wire, she saw nothin'. All right, she's got the hots for me, you all know that, and she was all over me last night. She got mad when I said no. - She wouldn't lie to me. - Well, she did, okay. She wanted to get even with me. She was drunk and that's it. You know, Sam's gonna love this. You kill me, he gets murder one. And your deep throat? Keeps on talking. - Better stop right there, boy. - I got work to do. - Okay, Mitch, put it away. - Scared me to death. You could've got yourself killed. - I'm okay. - I just don't ever wanna lose you. (gun fires) Kicks like a mule. - Yeah, all right, move a little further forward. All right, relax your arms a little bit too. Loosen them up a little bit. Okay, what are you gonna do? Exhale, squeeze slowly-- - Honey, don't. - Don't pull. (gun fires) Beautiful, good shootin, Sundance. - Thank you. - Let's hope you never have to use it. - Yeah, but if I do, I damn sure wanna know how. (guns fires) - The grand jury convenes next month. You're the key witness. The hearing will be closed. - [Sandra] And? - Grand jury proceedings are secret, no press, no public. I can keep your involvement there hidden, but if we get the indictment against Caldwell, you're gonna have to testify. - In court? - In open court. - A grand jury can indict him, but only a court can convict him. It will be a public trial. Look, I don't want you to put yourselves in anymore danger. I'll understand if you choose not to go forward. - (sighs) Look, I'm tired and I'm scared, but I'm not about to back down now. - Are you sure? - Well, it's just a jailhouse rumor, Sam, but the whisper is this is going to the grand jury. - Who's investigating? Will you put that damn thing away! - Well, I hate to be the one to say, Sam, but it's the feds. - It's that damn newspaper, isn't it? - (coughs) I don't rightly know, Sam. - Don't you Sam me! Get off your fat butt and fix it. - I can't do that, Commissioner. - What do you mean you can't? - Those Washington boys, they're like mean ole ticks. One smell of blood, they just burrow right on in (chuckles). - This isn't Washington, boy. This is Georgia. (slow delicate music) - Listen, your mom wanted me to talk to you. (camera clicks) - You set the ASA? - Nope, forgot. You know these guys we work for? Well, we've been trying to put him in jail. Now it's all about to hit the fan. Things are getting a little, well, a little dangerous. - Is that why my mother sleeps with a gun under her pillow? (camera clicks) - Well, we're working with the FBI. I'm gonna have to testify before a grand jury, I might have to leave town for a little while. - What about my mom. If you go away, she won't have anyone, will she? - Sure she will. Someone real special. - I'll be waiting right here. - I promised Shane I'd take him fishing this summer. - I don't think Shane has anything to worry about. - [Tommy] Okay. - There's all this food. - [Tommy] Thanks. - [Sandra] Mm hmm. - Almost done, here it comes. - [TV Reporter] Due to unexpected rainfall-- - [Tommy] Where's Shane? Shane, come on up, here it is. Come on, hop along. - [TV Reporter] And now here's Brian. - [Brian On TV] On the local front, a federal grand jury has indicted Labor Commissioner Sam Caldwell on fraud charges. - [Tommy] Nice! (Sandra laughs) - [Brian] The eight count indictment is the result of an ongoing investigation which began when The Georgia Gazette reported widespread corruption inside the Department of Labor. A trail is to expected to begin next month. (Shane and Tommy shout) (phone rings) (all chatter excitedly) - How, how? Fine, all right. I understand, we'll call you back. - Sandra, what do you think of that? What's wrong? - Curtis. - What is it? - There's been a leak. They know who you are. (reporters chatter) - Mr. Caldwell. - Mr. Caldwell. - [Reporter] Do you plan to resign, sir? - I'm confident that a jury will clear my good name and now, ladies and gentlemen, the job training bill needs me. Excuse me. - The Georgia Gazette reported widespread-- - Georgia Gazette, don't tell me you read that rag. I, for one, am proud to say I read our own Atlanta Constitution, thank you. - [Reporter] Well, what about Mr. Marchant, sir? - Mr. Marchant is a disgruntled state employee, and I may add a liar. And as of today, Mr. Marchant no longer works for the Georgia Department of Labor, please-- - [Man In White Shirt] Commissioner, commissioner-- - Young man, if I were you, I'd get outta my way! (reporters chatter) - It seems that somebody planted a bug in my office. You know who? - No, sir. - It also seems that Tommy Marchant testified before the grand jury. - He did? Well, what does that got to do with me, Mr. Wiley? - I know that you and Tommy are close friends. - Yes, sir, I have a number of close friends, so? - Atlanta just slashed my budget. I'm gonna have to let you go. - I really need this job, Mr. Wiley. - Doesn't have to be like this, you know. - [Sandra] No? - No, you're a smart woman. - Well, how smart do I have to be? - Smart enough to be a team player. - What's a team player expected to do? - A team player's expected to care about her boss, the commissioner. A team player's expected to testify for him against Tommy Marchant if push comes to shove. - That's some very serious team playing. - [Harris] Mm hmm. - Can you let me think about it? - Well, you do that then. - I really need this job, Mr. Wiley. You can't put it off any longer, you gotta go. - [Tommy] I'm not running. - It's not running, Tommy. They'll put you in a safe house. - Yeah, where I can't call you, can't see the kids. - [Sandra] Tommy, please. - And what if there's a leak in the FBI? All right, I'm hiding out here in town. - I want you safe. - [Tommy] Well, I don't wanna talk about it. - Would you just listen. - I don't wanna talk about it. (slow subdued music) - Why are you guys yelling? It woke me up. - Oh, sweetheart, come here. Come here, I'm sorry. - Sorry, darlin', didn't mean to talk so loud. - Are you gonna leave like daddy did? - [Sandra] Oh. - No, sweetheart. - Tommy may have to go away for a little while, but he'll be back. Back to bed, okay? - Okay. - Goodnight, Tommy. - Goodnight, sweetheart. - Hey, Tommy? I just wanna say I'm glad you're not gonna run like mom wants you to. - Shane, your mom's the bravest person I ever met. You must be very proud of her. - Yeah, I guess. - Shane, look, I'm no big hero. Okay, I'm scared to death. I know these boys, but if I run like the FBI wants me to I won't see your mom for a long time. And I've been waiting for someone like her my whole life. I'm not gonna give her up now. Simple as that. - She know that? - I believe she does. - I've slept on it, Mr. Wiley. You want me to testify for Mr. Caldwell against Mr. Marchant. - That's right. - And if I do, I can keep my job. - Correct. - Well, it seems to me that if I'm gonna join the team, I ought to be awarded a position of greater responsibility. - (chuckles) Why Sandra, well, I think you better call me Harris. You're a tough woman, Sandra. - Yes, I am, Harris. - Well, I think I can swing a promotion, yeah. - And what do I say against Tommy Marchant, Harris? - I bet if you tried real hard, I can't tell you what to say, but if you tried real hard I bet you could remember something that said to you. - Such as? - Such as the time that Tommy Marchant offered you a promotion in return for sexual favors. Or the time that Mr. Marchant had you double bill the state for per diem claims. - I can't tell you what pleasure this gives me. I got him cold, didn't I? What's wrong? Something the matter with the tape? - No, it's not the tape, Sandra. We got a tip, there's a contract out on Tommy. (slow unsettling music) You know, I can't protect him if he won't come in. - I'll get in touch with him. - You think he'll listen? - I don't know. (slow tense music) - [Sandra] You okay? - [Tommy] Yeah, I'm having a ball. - Curtis wants you to come in. - Yeah? (slow suspenseful music) We had that talk before. - Yeah, well, I guess we're gonna have to have it again. - Afraid not. (shotgun fires) Let's go, get in the car. They must have followed you. - Oh my God, the kids. Tommy, get the kids. I'll kill 'em if they hurt my babies. - [Tommy] Let's go. - Oh, sweetheart. - [Tommy] Shane! Shane! - [Sandra] You're sleepy, come back up here. Jump up on your bed. Let's get this around your shoulders. - For God's sake, no they took a shot at us. Could have killed Sandra. - I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go. - Shannon, please, just don't fuss, all right? - [Tommy] No, we're going to Beth's. - [Sandra] Move it, Shane, come on, baby. - Right. - [Shane] What are we doing? What is going on? - No, yeah, no they're coming with us, both of them. Of course, all right, go ahead, why not. - [Sandra] Look out. Here we go, up we go. - [Tommy] Just tell your men meet us there. (police radio chatters) - [Officer] Is everybody okay? - [Tommy] Let's go on in. - [John] They took a shot at you? - Well, they're not exactly a friendly bunch. - She gonna be all right? - You ever had to talk back to a shotgun? - Look, Tommy, we need her testimony. Without it we might as well just go home. - I know. - [John] Look, come on. Sorry about-- - [Tommy] Oh, it's all right. I appreciate you coming in. - Mom, don't worry, okay. I'll take care of Shannon, everything will be okay. - I know I'm the last person to lecture you, Sandra. - If I testify they could... It's not me I'm worried about. - Go for it, mom. - Could go on for a long time, honey. - Remember when you came and talked to me about that reporter? I remember that night at the hospital. I remember. My daughter's never gonna feel that way. Do it for your kids, Sandra. - I love you. Thank you, Beth. - Will you state your name for the record, please. - My name is Sandra Clayton. - And Miss Clayton, could you tell this court what position you hold with the Georgia Department of Labor? - I am a secretary. - Are you acquainted with the defendant, Mr. Sam Caldwell? - Yes. (mid-tempo dramatic music) - [Beth] Come on, come on, come on, honey. Everyone, everyone, a toast. To Tommy and Sandra, my best friends, may stardust fall. - [All] Cheers. (slow delicate music) - [Tommy] Are we ready to cut this thing? All right, sweetheart. Come on up, you wanna see this? - Okay. - This is a big moment. All right. (guests cheer and applaud) That's a sweet kiss. Your mom's a good kisser. - Tommy, this is from the three of us. - You're kiddin'. Well, look from the three, you too? All right, lemme see. Let's, here, will you come on over here. - [Beth] Yeah, I got her. - Thank you, grab her arm. - There you go. - [Shannon] Guess, Tommy. - A fishing reel. No, oh, man, Shane, this is, look at this ladies and gentlemen. (all clap) Thanks pal. - It's a DASA. - And that's strong. - No, I won't. - Don't do that, not that close! - You look good this close, all right, all right. Well, let's set one up. What do you think, is this loaded? - Yeah. - [Tommy] All right, you go ahead. - [Beth] Okay, all right, great. - [Shannon] Where're you gonna stand, Tommy? - [Tommy] I'm gonna stand right next to your momma, hon. - [Sandra] Come here, Shannon. - Now how do you work this thing? Okay, guys, ready? - [Shannon] But I wanna stand next to-- - [Sandra] Okay, okay, okay, Shane, you come over here. - Very good, now smile, okay. (camera clicks) Beautiful. - [Sandra] One more for good luck. - Okay. All right, smile. (camera clicks) (guests cheer and applaud) - [Tommy] All right, well, thanks. (slow delicate music) (MultiCom Jingle)
