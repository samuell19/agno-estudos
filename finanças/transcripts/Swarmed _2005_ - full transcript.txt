For nearly half a century, the folks here at Dundas, Indiana, have insisted that they grill a better burger than anyone else. This year we're going to find out. Dundas hosts the first ever national burger cook-off. We'll show you all the action and drama as the best backyard chefs in America get ready for an unforgettable battle to create the number one burger in the world, brought to you by Washburn's Tasty Sauce, the best barbeque sauce in America. (Mooing) Man: Yee-haw! (Upbeat banjo music) (Sizzling) I got the recipe for Washburn Tasty Sauce from my daddy and he got it from his daddy. Tradition isn't just a word at Washburn, it's a way of life. One dab of Washburn Tasty Sauce will ground chuck into filet mignon. Washburn Tasty Sauce, one taste will make you a believer or I'll eat my hat. Man: Yee-haw! Male Announcer: Washburn's Tasty Sauce in fine stores nationwide. Hm. You ever try that sauce? No, sir, I don't like barbeque. Neither do I. But when Mr. Washburn arrives today, you are going to convince him that Tasty Sauce is your favourite kitchen condiment. You think you can do that? Yes, sir, I'm sure I can, Mayor Gibson. You bet you can. ♪ (Slam) ♪ (Camera shutter clicking) What happened? Well, it looks like something stung him to death. ♪ Ask you a few questions? This is an experiment to build a better pesticide for paravespula germanica, the yellow jacket wasp. There were eight yellow jackets in here last night. Six of them were dead; they're still here. Two lives ones are missing. They must have got out somehow. Yellow jackets, huh? Take a look at this. It's dead, right? Yeah... Well, that makes seven, but there's still one more. It's got to be around here somewhere. Man: Where do you want the body? You'll have to take him down to the morgue. Get Doc Ramsey to do a PM. Man: Okay. What's that? Any death which is attributable in whole or in part to an animal attack must receive a post-mortem. County health regulations. What's that for? It tracks wasp pheromones. Kind of funny, isn't it? What? This guy gets stung to death in a place where all you do is come up with new ways to kill bugs? Molecular Genome Associates is a lot more than just pesticides. We're pioneering new techniques in genetic sequencing. Yeah, but how come it killed him? I've been stung by bees; it didn't kill me. About 1% of the population is highly allergic to the venom in bee and wasp stings. And this guy was in that 1%? He must've. What all do you put in your pesticides? Quite a number of ingredients.

So, today I thought that we would deal with a little bit more of a practical question, like what to do about those pesky yellow jackets. Well, the answer is simple: leave them alone. Yellow jackets are scavengers. They clean up organic matter that can trigger epidemic and disease. So, I know that that raw chopped meat looks like your next quarter-pounder, but to these guys it's just a mess waiting to be cleaned up. So, let them do what nature intended them to do. Hey! If you don't bother them, they won't bother... I was watching that. She doesn't know what she's talking about, man. Wasps are psychotic, sadistic freaks. They don't just sting out of self defence. They sting us because they love to make us suffer. Well, that's not what my science teacher said. He said that wasps can be actually kind of useful. Yeah? Well, why don't you make yourself useful and go on down to the store for me. (Rustling) Hold on. (Phone ringing) Don't forget to get everything on the list this time.

She'll lay as many as 1500 eggs every single day for the next three years. But she won't do it here. She will do it in Alaska or North Dakota or Saskatchewan sometime next spring because right now it's really a little too cold for a virgin queen to mate. And if they don't re-colonize, then there's not going to be enough bees to pollinate flowers. There'll be less fruit and less vegetables. It's all part of nature's amazing plan to regenerate and re-propagate every season. Do I have any questions? Yes? How come it didn't sting you? That's a good question. Wasp and bees will only attack if you engage in what they consider to be threatening behaviour. If I moved very quickly around her, that might trigger an attack. But because I'm moving very, very slowly, she won't hurt me. One time I got stung by this wasp but then all of a sudden about six or seven other wasps attacked me. And they can do that because when wasps sting, they release an attack pheromone. And that is a chemical that lets all the other wasps in the area know they got to attack whatever's in their way, which in this case happened to be you. Excuse me a second. (Whispering) Okay.

I'm going to have to run the blood work and get back to you. Correct me if I'm wrong, but we already know the cause of death, right? Wasp stings. Well, a man dies of a wasp sting while doing an autopsy of another man who died of a wasp sting. What are the odds of that? You're the entomologist, you tell me. Well, it's possible, but two fatalities like this? It's really not probable. Is it possible that they're both allergic to wasp venom? That's an allergy that affects less than 1% of the population. Yeah, that's what the guy from MGA said. What guy? Kent Horvath, the researcher up there at the labs. Does MGA have some involvement here? This guy worked up there. He was temping as a nightshift janitor. That's where they found him. Well, I got some city business I got to take care of. I'm afraid this might take a little while.

Is there something else? A rumour has it that Washburn is opening a big chain of upscale barbeque restaurants and the first one's going to be right here in Dundas. Well, this is confidential, just be between us, but I'd say there is a possibility. But he can't expand unless this stock offering he has does well. You got that right, Tiny. He's got a lot riding on that IPO of his. If this stock does well, some of that money coming back here? Uh... Dwight, do me a favour, would you? Could you just leave us alone for a few minutes? The Chief here and I have some official business to discuss. Well now, Tiny, what is it you want to say?

I'll talk to Mr. Washburn. He, well, he can be a very generous man. How generous? I'll talk to him. I don't know how generous he will be. You know, I am going to be retiring and that city pension won't go too far. I know that, Tiny. Now, you and I have been running this town together for a long time, right? And haven't I always taken care of you? I just want to make sure that you and your new friend Mr. Washburn continue to take care of me. And then we can erase these little conversations.

I need to talk to you. Yes, Mr. Washington? Where the hell is your boss? He was supposed to be here this morning, remember? You know what? I'll go check on him. (Knocking) Mayor Gibson? (Knocking) Hello. Sir. Gibson, you know you shouldn't be drinking. We have lots to do today. (Shouting) (Buzzing) (Thud) (Clattering) ♪ (Buzzing) (Clinking) (Gunshots) (Yelling) (Crash) ♪ (Clicking) Dammit! ♪ (Buzzing) (Gunshot) ♪ (Street din) Heydon, what are you doing here? We've got a problem, chief. What kind of problem? We've had three fatalities. Two yesterday, including the coroner, and one the night before. All the result of... (Whack) Result of what? Of yellow jacket attacks, sir. That's not really a police matter. No, sir, ordinarily it wouldn't be but this is a... a genetically altered swarm. That's a few hundred insects and it's probably growing by the minute. These bugs are way more toxic, their venom far more deadly than ordinary wasps and we don't know where they are right now. Who told you about this? Cristina Brown. She's a professor up at the college. An entomologist. She's been monitoring the situation along with a researcher from MGA. They're saying that if this swarm shows up downtown at the cook off, we could have more fatalities. They're recommending we cancel the event, get everybody indoors and alert the county health. Well, that's a little extreme. Don't you think? Well, we've had three fatalities, sir. I don't think we can afford not to. And what if it's a false alarm? What if these killer wasps never show or they're not as bad as your professor thinks? But, sir, I've seen the bodies. Then this town would be a laughingstock, not to mention lost revenue and lawsuits we'd be facing. Are you prepared to take responsibility for that? Are you prepared to put your good standing in the community on the line, Doug and mine too? Because that's what we'd be doing if we shut this thing down. Yes, sir, I am if that's what it takes. Well, the decision is not yours to make. We're not shutting the cook off down and that is final. But, sir... Uh-uh. You just put a couple of paramedics on standby. I'm sure the mayor will authorize the overtime. With all due respect, chief, this is a swarm. I don't think a couple of paramedics are going to make a... I'm not asking you to think, am I, Doug? No, sir. Well, was there anything else? No, sir. You are dismissed. (Mutters) Yellow jackets. (Buzzing) ♪ (Yelling) (Buzzing) ♪ (Sobbing) Stop a second. Wait, wait, wait. What happened here? It was horrible, horrible. I'm sorry. Oh. Oh my god, is that the mayor? Yellow jackets? Just one. When-when I found the body, it-it was stuck in his eye. Did you kill it? Yes, I did. I blew it to kingdom come. Looks like we lost them again. Well, this thing is real delicate. Come on, admit it, Q. I mean, we're never going to find them. That thing's got a limited signal. Hey, if a tool isn't working right, what you got to do is... (Tapping) (Beeping) ...fix it. (Buzzing) Aftershave. Just kidding. So, if I understand you correctly, Mr. Washburn, you're saying that there is no such thing as a bad burger. One little dab of Washburn tasty sauce on any cheap ground chuck will make it taste like filet mignon. Cristina: Excuse me, Mr. Washburn. Hello, little lady. How can I help you? Uh, no thank you. I need you to help me to get the word out to get this event cancelled before a lot of people get hurt. What did you say? Well, I'm talking about a major breaking health crisis. There's a swarm of deadly predators that have left four fatalities in its wake. Deadly predators? Well, what are we talking about? Pit bulls? No, genetically altered yellow jackets. Wasps? Wasps with venom that is so toxic one sting can kill you. Excuse me, but are you pulling my leg, honey? Dr. Brown is a professor of entomology. She's not pulling your leg. Pheromones from that swarm could attract every wasp in the county. Now you better listen to her while you still got a chance. Hey, dude, are you threatening me? Hey, turn that camera off, goddamn it, now. Listen, Mr. Washburn, please, uh, this is not a joke. This is a major crisis here. Step into my office. Four people have died. You got about three hours to take care of your little crisis before the cook off festivities start. I got a lot riding on this, a whole lot. I'm going to do everything in my power to see that it comes off without any hitches. Are you willing to risk the lives of all these people? There's dozens, maybe hundreds of people here. Why don't you find a nice quiet place to deal with your crisis. Are you listening? Because if that swarm shows up, people are going to get hurt. I'll tell you who's going to get hurt. If either one of you interferes in any way, you'll be facing criminal trespassing charges and a multi million dollar lawsuit. You cross me, I'll ruin you. Ellie? Can you believe this guy? Look here now. Now, where's that boss of yours? 'Cause I got my hands full here. I could sure use some assistance. He got stung by a yellow jacket. He what? What if it's still alive? I beg your pardon? I got to go and find out and make sure. I got to go. I got to cancel the cook off. We got to stop it. We got to stop the cook off now! (Sigh) ♪ Hey Ellie. Hey Ellie, listen. You can't go cancelling the cook off. What are you doing in here? What if there's more of them? The yellow jackets? I don't think you have to worry about that. Oh yeah. Yeah, I do. And when I find them, I'm going to shoot them. Yeah, well, you do that, but the festivities, they're going to be starting in a few hours and, baby, I got to get organized. Oh, there aren't going to be any festivities, not until I find all those sons of bitches. There's never just one. They live in a nest, move in a swarm. Do you have a problem with that? No, I ain't got no problem with that, no ma'am, nuh-uh. Good. It's us. Or them. It's a war. No time for festivities in a war. (Whack) (Grunt) That's where you're wrong, Ellie. Always time for barbeque. (Static) Looks like they were here not too long ago. What if they're still here? Let's go have a look-see. ♪ (Buzzing) Oh no. (Buzzing) I thought you said there were a few hundred of them. The others must have moved on. And they're going to keep moving until the queen finds a good spot for a new nest. (Buzzing) Hey, you better get back in the van. You want some of me? Well, come on. Get a piece of me. (Buzzing) ♪ Get out of here now. Go! Get down now. If the swarm comes here, it's going to be really, really bad. We've got to be prepared for that. Yep, we have to take care of them ourselves. Yeah, but we got to find a way to neutralize them fast. You mean kill them. Okay, kill them. And kill them fast. Well, what are we going to do without hurting any innocent bystanders? Yeah. I'm thinking ordinary off the shelf pesticides aren't going to be 100% effective here. Yeah, no kidding. Hang on. What? (Bell jingles) Okay, wasps breathe through spiracles, tiny holes in their legs and... I know what spiracles are. Right. I'm sorry, I'm explaining again. Well, what are you thinking of? Well, wasps expend a lot of energy just buzzing around, which means they need a high oxygen intake all the time. Okay. So if we can cover up the spiracles, they wouldn't be able to breathe. And if they don't breathe, they die. And? I'm thinking... What? What is that? Oh, that could work, huh? Hey, what about that over there? Yeah, that could work too. Yeah, it sure could. Thanks, Q. Too bad about the van. We got to find these suckers fast. Right. They've been going on a consistent course. If they keep on, it'll take them right into the middle of the cook off. (Buzzing) Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the annual Dundas burger cook off. Broadcast nationally for the first time, thanks to gourmet television and our sponsor, Washburn Tasty Sauce.

Right on. Thank you very much, folks. (Buzzing) ♪ (Sizzling) (Applause) (Splash) Mr. Washburn, can I have a word with you for a second please? Uh, what's the problem, officer? The problem is we have to cancel this event and we have to cancel it right now. I don't think I understand. We've had three deaths in the past two days from yellow jacket stings. Well, I hardly think... These bugs are faster, more aggressive and their venom is way more toxic than anything you've ever seen. I don't see any yellow jackets. Do you? Are you hearing me? We have had three deaths already. Well, I'm sorry about that, officer, but I don't see how a few isolated incidents... These are not isolated incidents. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get some people together and we'll make some wasp traps. That ought to... I don't think that you fully grasp the magnitude of this situation. I'm willing to work with you, sir.
