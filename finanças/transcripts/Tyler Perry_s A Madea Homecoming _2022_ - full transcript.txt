Get him up. [man] Can you believe we're graduating? [scoffs] Yes, I can, man. That was a lot of hard work. Well, you aced it. And so did you. I did okay, but you were the valedictorian. [chuckles] Hey, that's right. - [clicks tongue] Ah! - [both laughing] Let's get to your great-grandma's house. All right, let's go. Hey, look, what is the rush, man? Look, we... Dinner's not till seven. We will get there. It will be great. I don't know what the rush is, but I know what the delay is. - You don't wanna tell them. - No, I don't. I don't wanna pressure you into this, but it's 2021. We graduate in two days. They should know. I know, dude, I know. It's just that like... Look, my family is different, okay? Look at my family. My father is West Indian, my mother is from Ireland, and I grew up in the Netherlands, until my dad passed. And because my mom had passed years earlier, I moved to Ireland to live with my great-aunt Agnes until I came here to go to a historically Black college. Now who's the one with the family with the different opinions? - Yeah. - It's Davi for the win. - You win. You win on that. You're right. - [chuckling] Thank you. I do look forward to meeting them someday. Well, yeah. Well, let's not rush that. Mmm. So... so I can confront my family, but you can't confront your great-aunt Agnes? Is that what I got? No, that's a completely different story because I feel like your mom is really open-minded, so she will be okay with this. - I know it. - Ah. Okay, yeah, but my dad will not be. Well, to hell with your dad. Davi, why do you hate my dad so much? You really have to ask? After all he did to you and your mom? See, you know, that's why I'm not telling you nothin' else. You don't forget nothing. Look... [sighs] ...he will be there tonight. So please, whatever you do, do not get into it with him. Okay? Good? - [woman] It's hot out here today. - [Brown] I know, Cora. I was hotter. [Cora] You was hotter? [Joe] You ain't gonna believe what happened. Brown tried to go all rotisserie on us and shit. - Uncle Joe. - [Joe] What? Hell. Cora, I don't wanna go to hell. Hell, no. I don't wanna go. Cora, I was lighting that fire to make the barbecue for my... my famous chicken, and boom, it got me, girl. - [Cora] What? - [Brown] I feel bad for them chickens. - I feel bad. - Chickens? What are you talkin' about? [Joe] Set hisself on fire. He gonna be a jigga now. He ain't finna eat no more chicken. - [Brown] Yes... - He put gasoline on... - What? - [Joe] He put everything on the grill... Thought I was makin' it big, Joe. I was makin' it big. - Wait a minute now... - Well, your ass got burned big, big-time. Are you all right? Oh, yes. Thank you so much for asking, baby. I'm good, but my knee been bothering me a little bit. I gotta go to a doctor and get it looked at. Uncle Joe, I'm talking to Mr. Brown. Are you okay? Ah, Cora, yes, I'm... Well, yes and no. I'm not fine. It's like I went to hell. - You went... - Yes, I went to hell, and Madea was there. And I said, "This definitely not the right place for me." - Ooh. - Here. Now you wanna bring him some damn water. - Yeah. - Joe, shut the hell up. I done burnt up already. Hey, Cora. How you doin', baby? - Hey, Madea. Can you take this bag? - Ooh, girl, I like that green dress. I'm not gonna take nothing. I like the dress though. [chuckles] Aw, Madea, you can take this bag. What the hell I look like to you, a bellman? Yeah, well, you look like two or three bellmans if you ask me. - She look like bells-men. - [Cora] Would y'all... She... she look like horsepower. Say somethin' else, Joe. Just shut up. Shut up while you livin'. Shut up while you got your nuts. Please, please shut up. I'll put 'em in that nutcracker. - Oh, Lord. - Oh, Joe. Madea, now look, I went to the store to get everything we needed. You could just hold this bag. I had to drive way across town. I know you had to drive way across town, Cora. Every time I go to the store, something done burned down or boarded up 'cause people protesting all over. I don't understand why they didn't burn up the whole neighborhood. We don't need that store. We need to burn everything in the neighborhood down. Burn it all down. Joe, what kind of sense it make to burn up your own damn neighborhood 'cause you upset about something? What the hell kind of sense it make what these police doin' to Black people? - Burn it all down. - Oh, I'mma... I'm finna punch him. Well, I'm just glad they didn't burn down the church 'cause it's in the same block. You know that's right, Cora. Thank God that church did not burn down. - Hallelujer. - Yes. - Hallelujer. - Yes! Hallelujer, thank God that church didn't burn down. Madea, I'm so glad you standin' up for the church. That's beautiful. - I don't care nothin' about that church. - What? It's just right next door to my favorite liquor store. So, you more concerned about the liquor store than the church? That's wrong, Madea. Nothing's wrong. Here's what you don't understand. - Jesus, the Lord God Almighty... - Uh-huh. He can turn water into wine. - He did. - Yes, he did. I got to go to the liquor store to get mine. Won't somebody praise Him? [laughs] What? You need to stop that foolishness. Come on, Madea, we gotta get started on this dinner. That's all right, Cora. We'll go to Red Lobster tonight, and we come back here tomorrow for the barbecue. Yeah, oh, I like Red Lobster, yeah. That's where me and B go all the time. Oh, B? Who is B? Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. - [chuckles] - [flies buzzing] - Give me that bag. Let's go in the house. - Is it me, or is Mabel drawing bugs? Would you stop that? I need y'all to go get the stuff out the car. Go on, get the stuff out the car. - [grunts] - [Cora] We can get started on this. [Brown, Joe] All right. Hurry up and get the stuff out... Mr. Brown, what is goin' on with the back of your clothes? All your behind is out. Cora, I thought I felt a breeze. It must've been when I burnt, Cora. Can you see anything? I see everything. - [Brown] Can you see anything, Cora? - Yes. You need to cover yourself up. You got all kinda hair back... You need to shave that. - Cora, can you see? - [Cora] Look like a baboon back there. - Cora, you see? - [Cora] Lord have mercy. [Cora] Yes, I see it. It looks terrible. I don't know how the hell she get chairs in that damn car. - At church... - Get the groceries. - [Brown] I'll get the bags. - Take 'em all around to the backyard. Okay. Joe, you didn't... Why you didn't tell me my butt was out? I... I been trying not to look at that ugly mother... Okay. Well, come to think of it, I have done a couple mothers. Hey, what you keep bending over...

You look so good. Both of y'all look good. - [Sylvia] Thank you. - Did y'all ride together? Yes. I told her I was fine, but she insisted on picking me up. You know I didn't want you on the road in that old car alone. - That's sweet. - Thanks. - That is so sweet. - [Sylvia] I got you. There's nothing like a good girlfriend... That's right. [Cora] ...to look out for you. - That's so sweet. - Thank you for letting me stay here. [Madea] Oh, you're so welcome. You can come here anytime you want, day or night. Long as you don't stay too long. You leavin' right after graduation, right? Ma... - Yeah. - Okay, good. Just right after, right? - As soon as it's over, y'all going home. - [Cora] Madea! Oh, is Ellie here? Oh, well, she called and said that she was on her way, but she's gettin' off work. She just got off duty. [sighs] Okay. I worry about my sister being a cop with all that's goin' on. Me too, sweetheart. I worry about her. - Know what I worry about? - [Cora] What? - I worry about her comin' up in here. - Why? With all these damn warrants I got, every time I see her, I be worried. I be like, "Baby don't come up in here." "I wanna hug you, but don't frisk me." I know that's your daughter, but Lord have mercy, Cora. Mm-mm. [chuckles] - Well, she just be looking out for you. - No, no. I... I got too many warrants. Sylvia's a lawyer. She can help you out with that. [Cora] Yeah. Last time Brown tried to help me, I went down to court, they told me that I had to, uh... uh, pay a... What they call... what they call... Oh, a fine. - I gotta pay a fine. - [Laura] Oh. I'm like, "You want me to pay a fine to get a driving license so I can get insurance?" "After I done bought my damn car?" Hell, no, I'm not finna to pay a fine, my... No. We not do... we don't pay no fines. They gotta catch me first. You getting too old for that, Madea. Sometimes you gotta get some thrills in your life. Do crazy stuff. I don't wanna die old and... That's what's keeping me young. - Running from the police. - What? - Yes. - Is that the trick? - Yes. That keep your heart strong. - [Cora] Don't listen to her. - You be like this all the time. - [Cora] Don't listen. - You been teaching me wrong. - Don't you listen to that. - I need some warrants and tennis shoes. - That's right. That's right. No, but I called Tim, and he said he's on his way as well. - [squeals] - Yes, my grandbaby. My baby is graduating. Oh my God. Can you believe that? Oh, he said he wants to tell us an announcement in front of the whole family while he here so... - What you think it is? - I have no idea, but... Whatever it is, you know it's good news. We all know Tim's a great kid. - His mama did a good job. - Yes, you did. In spite of that daddy. Ooh, baby, don't talk about him. Speaking of that, how you doin' after that divorce? - Lord have mercy. - Yes, 'cause we know it was bad. - I'm fine. - That's good. - You sure? - I'm really good. I am. No, 'cause after that divorce, you was just looking... [voice drops] ...bad. - Madea! - What? - She was just looking... [voice drops] ...bad. - [Cora] Yeah, 'cause we know it was bad. I'm good. I really am. Sylvia, she represented me, and without her I don't know where or what I would be right now. Well, I just wish I could've gotten you more. What'd I tell you? I told you she wasn't gonna be able to do right by you. What do you mean? How she gonna do right by her when she going through the court system? If you go through the court, they tell you what to do. How the hell a judge gonna make a decision on what you could and can't do? Hell no to the judge. I ain't going with the judge. You should've come to me. I'd have got you half of everything. I'd have got you half of the sofa... Ask somebody. In 2004, I took a chainsaw to some shit. - You better ask somebody. - I know that's right. There's the legal way, then there's the Madea way. That's right. That's right. Right, exactly. Don't follow her tr... Don't do that. Don't do that. Oh, sorry. But you look like this divorce is not affecting you at all, sweetie. - I'm so happy for you. - Unbothered. - That's right. You look so good. - [Madea] No. - But she do look good. - No. - [Cora] What? - You look good, but some... Mm-mm. Uh-uh what? Baby, after somebody had a divorce, and they go through a bad, rough time, and they start looking this good, they usually done found somethin' else. When you're trying to get over something, they slip under a man with legs wide open. - Madea! - Cora, I can say what I wanna say. All that money I spent helping that girl pay for that boy to go through college. "All that money"? Yes, I spent... What? How much was... - I got to go... I got to add it up. - [Cora] Please add it up. It was $37.95, is what I sent to you to help put that boy through school. What's she gonna do with $37? Ain't about where it come from. It's what you had to do to get it. - I see. - So y'all come on. Listen, we get some stuff ready for tomorrow. You sit here, baby. You look so pretty. Y'all get them 'matoes ready. - Help your mama. - [Cora] I'm slicing them. [Madea] Go on, get that ready. - You're right. - [Cora] I'm gonna slice these tomatoes. [Tim] Hey. - Hey. - [squeals] Mama. Oh, my baby. My baby! - Look at them. - [Cora] How you doin'? - [Tim] Hey. - It's so good to see you. Look at my baby. - Good to see y'all. - Come in. - [chuckling] - Hi. - Hey. - Hi, Mama.

Valedictorian. - [Cora] Yes! - [laughing] Hi, I'm so glad that you're here, Sylvia. And thank you for all that you did for her. Will you stop it? Y'all do not have to keep thanking me. I do, though. Tim, boy, I am so proud of you. I mean, all that money we spent puttin' you through school. - You better do something with yourself. - I do. I will. I promise. You better. [laughing] I believe you now. You remember my friend Davi? - "Davi"? His name Davi? - [Tim] Yes. I been calling that baby Davey. I... I'm so sorry. [all laughing] - Good to see you, Laura. - It's good to see you too. [Joe] I got a question. - [Cora] What is it? - Why all these Negroes in this house? - Is this a homicide? - [Cora] No... Y'all need to go home. Uncle Joe, watch your mouth. Did y'all finish everything outside? I did the best I could. I couldn't look at Brown's ass no more, so I sent him home. Brown went home to wash the soot off his ass. - Uh, I think it was soot. - No, Joe, I don't know if that was soot. I've known Brown a long time. They call him Brown for a reason. - Oh my Lord. - [all laughing] Oh Lord. Hey, Uncle Joe. I know damn well you ain't come in here in that uniform. [Cora] My baby can wear her uniform if she wants. She's an officer, and I'm so proud of you, baby. Thank you, Mama. You're welcome, sweetheart. You the reason everybody getting to the end of the damn street and backing up and turning around. That's 'cause of you. That's what they do here. They'll back up in a minute when they see a police car. Tear up damn light poles, everything to get away. You better ask me. I know. [Joe] You need to take that uniform off and move that police car before you have everybody in this neighborhood trying to kill somebody 'cause you in the neighborhood. Get outta here. I am not moving, Uncle Joe. If my weed man can't get here to give me my weed, we gonna have a problem. Freddy coming over? Tell him to get me about four... - [whispers] I'll tell you later. - So you need to move that police car. You know, I... I can actually arrest you. And I'll protest all over your ass. I'll protest all over your ass. [Ellie] What for? Violation of my civil right on January 6th on the US Capitol. That I can smoke weed if the weed is right. - [Cora] What? - Tell your weed man to come see me. What you gonna do? - Bring him on over. - Don't be threatening my weed man. - I'll show you what... - Threatening my weed man. But, Uncle Joe, you would be in the wrong. Weed is illegal here. I got a subscription. Uh, I... I think you mean prescription, right? - Right. Right. - Who... who the hell is that? - That's Tim. - The educated one who we're celebrating. Don't correct him. He's stupid. I know what I said. Don't correct me 'cause you went to college. I know what I'm saying. I got a subscription. Valedictorian. Well, valedict your ass out of here before you get kicked in it. [Cora] What is wrong with you? Now, you move that damn car right now. I am not. And tell your weed man, come see me. You know what I'm gonna do? If I count my joint, and I'm running low, and I run out 'cause you here in your uniform, we... we... - We gonna have a problem. - [Ellie] You know what? - I'mma go change... - [Cora] Okay. ...before I have to arrest somebody. I'm so sorry. - So that's my Uncle Joe. - [Laura] Yes, that's Uncle Joe. Come on, watch... watch this. Uncle Joe? [Joe] What? [Tim] How you doin'? Uh, fair to middlin'. Nuts don't work, but they still trying. They'll crank out a little now and then to make her happy. Okay... Uh, I didn't need to know that. What the hell you ask me for if you didn't want to know? - Fair enough. - Okay. - This is my friend Davi. - [Davi] Hello, sir. Get your hand away. You ain't heard of COVID-1920. I tried to tell you. [chuckles] - [Davi clears throat] - [Tim sighs] Why... why you... why you talk so funny? I'm from Europe. Oh, you're from Europe? That why your pants so tight? What? Son, I can see your camel toe. [chuckles] - This is what our generation's wearing. - What your generation is wearin'. I see. Your generation is turning nuts into nutmeg. Just powder. Back in the day, we had nuts. We had balls. We had sacks. Now everybody just got powder. Y'all ain't got no balls. Y'all, everybody woke. Y'all need to go back to sleep. All right. Would you leave my roommate alone, please? Oh, your... Oh, he's your roommate? - Yeah. Yeah. - We share a dorm room on campus. [Joe] Your uncle Peaches shared a dorm room on camper too. It was about, uh, 40 years he shared that dorm room with that dude on camper. He liked them tight britches. He had a camel toe too. Joe, leave them damn children alone. Y'all get up and bring them bags upstairs for your mama. Don't be talking to that fool. Go on upstairs. Get the bag right there. - [Tim] Okay. - Bring it upstairs. Don't... don't hurt yourself. Don't break your fingernail. Don't strain your camel toe. The hell is wrong with them? [woman] Hootie-hoo! [Madea] Oh, that Bam. Oh yeah. Hey, everybody. - Hey! Good to see you, Bam. - [Ellie] Hi.

Ooh, that new man you're seeing? No. Too new to invite him. I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about Laura. - You seein' somebody, baby? - No, she's talkin' about Richard. What? [splutters] Madea, just calm down. Uh-uh. You back with him? Oh, absolutely not. - But he is Tim's father. - That's right. And Tim wanted him there, so I said, "Yes." No, ma'am. Did anybody think to ask me? - This is my damn house. - Madea... You gonna let that man come up in here? That boy left you broke and had nothing. And I was having to take care of you. I gave you $37 to help put that boy through school. You let him come in my house when he ain't do nothing for you? - Madea, you... - He better keep his ass away from me. Y'all better keep his ass away from me. That's all I'm saying. [Laura] I'm sorry. Oh yes. Ooh. Wait. I thought you was tired. [chuckles] Shut up. [chuckles] - Tim? - [Tim] Huh?

How did you know I was here? That's why I was asking so many questions. Really? You didn't suspect a thing? Oh! And we came all the way from Dublin. - Well, she... - [Davi chuckles] In a hairy plane. - [Davi] Yes. - [Cora] Hairy plane? - What's a hairy plane? - I don't know.

What'd she say? - Wait one damn minute. - What... what... what... What... what did you just damn say? - She called us a bunch of niggers. - Did I say something wrong? What'd you mean, if you don't know if you said something wrong? Yeah, you said something wrong up in this bitch! No, she said "knickers." - I heard her say we're a bunch of n-words. - Oh no, no, no, no. That's not what she said. Don't tell me I didn't hear what I heard. She said, "Y'all a bunch of niggers." - No, no, no. "Knickers." "Knickers." - Yes. C-K. "Knickers." Don't be calling us no niggers up in this nigga. Hold on, it's "knickers." It's underwear. Yes, yes. It's "knickers." These are knickers. - [all exclaiming] - Ooh! [Joe] And she just damn flashed me.

I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance to tidy myself up. It does look like a busted mattress. But I'm sorry. Well, say that. Hell, say panties or something. Baby, them ain't no panties. Them some big-ass drawers. It's just... look, it's just a language gap. That's all. That language gap almost got you capped. You better be careful here. - You better not say that again. - Well, you know, I... She won't. Right, Mummy? [Madea] She better not, Cathy B... whatever your name is. I won't. I'm sorry. Well, now all that's cleared up. Um... Is it, Cora? Is it clear? Is it really cleared up, Cora? Yes, it's cleared up, Madea. It's clear, Uncle Joe. It was a mistake. I'm still offended by being called a nigger up in my house full of niggas. [Cora] It's okay, Uncle Joe. Well, we were about to take the boys to dinner down at Red Lobster. We would love for you to come. [Joe] Cora, hold on. Now you want me to sit at a table with white folk from Europeo? And I gotta sit there with a police officer from the popo?

It hurt, but I got that money. - I paid my bills. - [Brown] Yes. Madea, now you want to come to this place and have a nice dinner, and you gonna sit at the table and talk about strippin'. - Hos got to eat too. - [Cora] What? This Red Lobster full of hos.

You about to lose your job. ♪ You about to, you about to You about to, remix ♪ - Here we go, Uncle Joe. - ♪ You about to lose your job ♪ - You with him too? - I like that, Joe. Defund this shit. Get rid of the police. The same way that we're saying "defund the police," there are criminals saying the same thing. That's why crime has gotten so much worse. Think about it. I don't know the answers, but somebody needs to have some conversation 'cause you'll never figure nothing out as long as everybody screamin' and yellin' at each other. My tax dollar, my tax dollar...

Richard, I told you not to come. Get on out. You just spoke to him earlier like he's supposed to be here. I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean to scare you, but I don't give a damn. - [Bam] Mabel. - [Madea] What? That's a shame. It's all right. Don't worry about it. Laura, I want to thank you and your family for the care you took with Davi. Ah, he's very special. Yes. You know I worried about him coming over to America on his own. - I didn't know what to expect. - Well, he is doin' great. Yes. You'll have to come and visit in Ireland. What? Oh, I like that. Yeah, I heard it's beautiful there. It is. So, you, Tim, and all the family come and visit Davi on the farm. The farm? Yes, he's goin' home to take over the family farm. Oh, I didn't...

Whatever you wanna tell us, you better tell us quick to get him outta here. So whatever you have to say, baby, say it, 'cause he got to go. - I'm runnin' out of patience. - I came...

We been talking about that for years. We all knew that. We all talked about it. We were waitin' on you to say somethin'. We don't rush nobody. You come out when you want to. That's fine. - You all right. We know that. - Mom, really? [Madea] We knew when you was a little boy. We knew. Yeah, baby, when somebody love you, it don't matter if you gay or not. They gonna love you anyway. And we love you. - Your family loves you, okay? - I'm so proud of you. [Madea] You ain't good at being down low. - Oh man. - [chuckles] - That's embarrassing. - No, don't be embarrassed. Proud of you. - I love you, guys. - [Madea] I love you too.

Actually, you are right. - Mm-hmm. Maybe he didn't want his family to know that he was... You know, he wasn't expecting them. Maybe. I just want them to be happy. So, how about, uh, Sylvia and Richard? Mm. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. I don't wanna think about him or her. [inhales] I just want to focus on my baby's graduation. [groans] - That's it. - [knocking on door] Come in. - Hey there. - [chuckles] Hey. I was getting ready to go to bed, but I wanted to come check on you. I know this been a rough day. - [Laura] Yeah. I'm good. - You good? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Yeah. I don't wanna talk about it. I'm good. - You don't wanna talk about it? - Mm-mmm. Okay, well, my house, my rules, so we're gonna talk about it. Oh, okay. That man ran off with your best friend. I don't understand. That's horrible. Just terrible that they would just leave you like that. Well, they didn't steal or run off or any of that. I just... I mean... I just wish they'd told me about it. That's it. [chuckles] Let me tell you two things. I want you to remember this here. You always know. God always send you a sign. People look for a oak tree, and God dropped a little acorn. You got to pay attention to the acorn. That's number one, okay? And number two, if you don't remember nothing else I tell you, remember this. I learned this a long time ago. Never let your girlfriend and your man hang out too often. So you think this all happened before my divorce? Sometimes I think that the mall is open, but ain't nobody shoppin'. I sti... I don't... - O... o... okay. - [Ellie] What? Okay. Nothing. [chuckles] You like your mama. Think about it, baby. You and this girl talk every day while she helping with your divorce. When did they find time to start dating, fall in love, and do all this if it wasn't before then? That's what I'm saying. - [Madea] See, I knew it. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. And baby, it hurts. My girlfriend stole my man. I mean, we were so close. I mean, she just... Ooh, she walked out with him. It was bad. Real bad. I don't wanna talk about it. - I think she wants to talk about it. - Uh, Madea? [Madea] Hmm? Would you like to talk about... - I said I don't want to talk about it. - Okay. It was December 1st, 1955. [women laughing] Bye, Laverne and Shirley. [classical music playing] Archie? I'll never forget it. There I was in Montgomery, Alabama. Archie, where are you? And my girlfriend Rose, we was roommates. Archie? And she left me. Archie, where are you? Archie? He had moved out. Took everything out of the damn house. Why are all your clothes gone from the dresser? Oh no. Whatever am I going to do? Archie? I was like, what is going on? Archie? Are you in the kitchen? Archie, where are you? I started looking all around. I can't find nothing. I'm looking for my man. He was gone. Oh no. Oh God. I knew he was messing around with somebody. I didn't know who it was. So terribly sad. He wasn't gonna just walk out on me. He did it. Then Bill Clinton did it later on. I wasn't finna have that. Operator, give me 1-2 Montgomery 0-6. Hi, is this the NAACP office? Is my girlfriend Rose there? I'm so terribly upset. I can't find Archie anywhere, and I'm in this terrible dilemma. Wait. Oh no. I think her things are gone too. Do you think they left together? [suspenseful music playing] So then I went to her job. She work over there at the N... [splutters] ...CP. Rose? Where's Rose? Excuse me. I'm looking for Rose. Everybody gonna act like they don't know? Somebody better tell me where the hell Rose is at up in here. Where's Rose? Where is Rose? [workers exclaiming] Where she at? Don't nobody know where Rose at? Y'all don't know where Rose at? Don't nobody know where Rose at? Where's Rose at? Where's Rose at? Where's she at up in this... Where Rose? Where Rose? Where Rose? Where Rose? Where Rose? Is Rose in here? I don't see Rose. Where's Rose? Somebody gon' tell me where Rose is at? Where is Rose at? [sobbing] I'd been driving all around looking for her everywhere. Then I look up on the bus, and there she is. What the hell? I know she ain't on this bus. I saw her on the bus, and I pulled in front of that bus in my car. And the bus driver say... [as Southern man] "Ma'am, you can't do that. This Montgomery, Alabama." And I was like, "I don't care." I know damn well you hear me on this bus, Rosa. I got out, and I stabbed them tires with everything I had in me. Rosa, I don't... Get off the bus, Rosa. Rosa, don't sit there like... Bus driver get back. You better open this door. Get off the bus, Rosa. I'mma get you, Rosa. You see me, Rosa. Get Rosa off the damn bus. Rosa. That's all right. I'm picketing. I'm taking a picture. I'm taking a picture of all this sh... I see you, Rosa. This is Madea. It is 19... That's Rosa, Rosa Parks. Y'all know her. I'm gonna post this in... It's 1955, but I'mma post it as soon as I know what year the... I'mma post it one day, but I'm taking it on my iPhone. I mean my aPhone ‘cause they didn't have iPhone back then, ‘cause it was A before I, but... That's Rosa Parks, and that's Archie back there. That's my man, Archie. She stole him from me, and I started the Civil Rights Movement 'cause of this. I was like, "Rosa, get off the bus. I just wanna talk to you." So she stayed on the bus. The man got mad. White people got mad. Next thing I know, Martin Luther King was there. Uh, Jesse Jackson, Millie Jackson. Uh, J... J... Little Janet was there. La Toya, Reba. All them Jacksons were there marching and protesting down there in 1955. - What Rosa are you talkin' about? - Rosa Parks. - The Rosa Parks? - [Madea]No, no, her name is Rose. Ain't no the Rose. She became Rosa Parks after all of that. You know why Rosa didn't get off that bus? People think she was trying to help Black people. That is not what happened. Only reason Rosa didn't get off, she didn't wanna get her ass whooped, 'cause she stole my man. - Okay. - [both chuckle] [Madea] And now look. Look, Rosa Parks is a whole entire Civil Rights hero. She's a shero. And you know why she's a shero? Because I would not let her get off that bus. Next thing you know, y'all can sit anywhere you want. Thank me. You're welcome. Praise Him. - Oh. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Madea praise. That's right. Thank you. I'm just saying that all that bad that was, me... me mad at her and wantin' to fight her, right? But look at the good that came out of it. Look at what has happened for Negroes because of what I did. You understand? - Cause and effect. - [Madea] I did that. Right. So, when we get to the graduation, I want you to have some cause and effect. Grab Sylvia and punch her dead in her damn face at that graduation. Come on, come on. Where's your thug? Get your inner thug out. If did that to Rose, then you do it too. That was back in the day, baby. I was young and sexy. I was 20 years old. Okay. So if you were about 20 back then, if I do the math and I carry the one, you'd be about 95 by now. [chuckles] Black don't crack. Unless you're using it. [chuckles] I took this back in 19 and 55. There it is. I took that picture. Okay. Ha ha. Proof is in the pudding. [indistinct chattering] [upbeat Irish music playing] Yes, ma'am. Oh. [groans] Hmm. Get them dishes clean. - Well, hello. - Hello, Cora. - How are you? Good to see you. - Hello, Laura. How you doin'? How you feelin'? [sighs] Terribly embarrassed. Uh, why? You didn't do anything to feel embarrassed. It wasn't your fault. - We're so sorry. - Yeah. Could... could I speak to Madea alone, please? Sure, sure. Madea. - We can take this outside. - Thank you. Yeah, come on, sit down, honey. - Can I help? - Uh, sure. Take this. - Okay. Thanks. - Come right over this way. Right this way. Good to see you, baby. - How you doin', hon? - Hello, Madea. Ma... Madea, I'm very embarrassed about last night. Honey, ain't nothing to be embarrassed about. Okay? I was a foolish old woman. Don't worry. We all been foolish old women for somebody. - [laughs] We have. - It's all right. - Yes. Oh, and thank you. - Mm-hmm. You know, when you get old, you get stiff and achy. Truth be told, that's why I use it. - Yes. - Mm-hmm. - I woke this morning with no pains. - Mm-hmm. [chuckles] Yeah, I was singing and dancing. [chuckles] Yep, I wake up like that too. My nipples were like two bullets. [both laughing] I haven't felt that alive in years. Oh, you want some more, don't you? Oh, like an addict. Ok... [chuckles] Okay. I'mma give it to you, but you gotta be careful with this stuff. Let me tell you, the key is this, you eat a little bit something before then take a little now, a little later. - You got to microdose it, understand? - Yes, thank you. Go on, take a little bit. I'm just gonna give you one. - Thank you very much. - Just one. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Oh, that is gorgeous. Yep. You know, I make this myself. - Do you? - Yes, I got the recipe. I'll give it to you, but you gotta be careful because if you do too much, you'll get five to ten. [chuckles] Be careful. - Thank you very much, you know. - You welcome.

Why didn't you say anything? [sighs] There's just too much going on. What? You gotta figure out what you wanna do. I didn't mean to hurt him. I didn't mean to hurt him. Well, then the only person who can fix this is you. So fix it. Come on, baby. I didn't ask y'all to bring y'all children here. This is a party for adults, half adults. - Not all adults. - [flies buzzing] Flies. I should have changed me drawers. [chuckles] Ooh, Agnes. You funny child. [chuckles] I need more "chocolate." - Do you? - This stuff isn't kickin' in. I'm thinkin' about giving you one, but I want you to understand this, and hear me good. This chocolate, you gotta be careful with it. I remember one time I had too much, and it snuck up on me all at once. Next thing I know, I found myself in Mexico chained to a mule named Arriba. - Oh! - Yes, honey. I was selling tequila from between my breasts there. Didn't know what happened. So I'mma give you one, but you gotta be responsible for what happens to yourself. - Just the one. - Okay. I don't know if I should. Maybe I shouldn't. [munching] - You know you should. - What is he thinkin' of, Davi? He has to come back to Ireland. His granddad needs him. What? That was the deal back then. When Davi's parents passed away. Lord rest them. Oh, yeah. Oh, rest them. - I'll never forget his last words. - Mmm. What was it? "Oh feck, it's a bus!" [both laughing] - Yeah. But... - Well, it'll kill him. When they passed, the deal was that Davi's granddad would run the farm until such time as Davi was old enough and the time was right for him to take over. And the time is right now. - Oh. - And he knows it. Oh, that's sweet. That's so sweet. But what if his heart wants something else now, baby? Feck his heart. Sometimes I'm sorry I had six children. Listen, baby, these children have their own lives to live, honey. - You got to let them live their life. - I know, but they owe us. You can't tell me that your Cora doesn't owe you something. [scoffs] Hell, yeah, she owe me. All them years I had to spend on that pole trying to take care of her. Do you know how many splinters I had to get removed from my inner thighs? Splinters? They didn't have brass poles back then. Hos got it so easy right now. Back in the day, all we had was telephone poles. And they didn't shellac em'. You had to get on and ride that thing and spin around and get that money. And I did. I paid for it. Today my inside look like hell. [chuckles] But I paid. I... I took... Listen. I had to do what I had to do, but I did it. He has to come back and run that farm. Let me ask you something. What if that ain't his dream? Feck his dream. He has to run that farm. How you gonna feel if that boy's sittin' there runnin' the farm, milking all them bulls, and he don't wanna be there. - Cows. - Say what? Cows. Milking cows. Not milking a bull. Milking cows. Oh. Well, whatever the hell it is. What will it matter if he did what you and his granddaddy want if his happiness is over here in America with that girl? You know how hard it is to run a farm? How hard it is to get a bull to mate with a cow? I had to French kiss a bull once. - [grunts] - [Madea] Hmm. He wanted more, but I wasn't having it. Well, not at that time. And all the cow shit to be cleaned up. We sacrificed for him to be here. Listen to me. Children gonna live their own lives whether we want 'em to or not. So either you can stand there and be against 'em or stand there with 'em while they make their mistakes or see if they gon' make a mistake and help them. You understand? - Madea, thank you for the chat. - What? - You're welcome. - But I'm determined. Davi is coming back to Ireland with me. Ain't nothin' I can do. I'mma give you a couple more candies, and we gon' see who gonna go somewhere with somebody. Here, just take that bag, baby. Enjoy yourself. We'll see who leavin'. Y'all come on in this house. It's too hot out! - I gotta get this girdle off. - I don't know if I should. Get these children outta my yard. I don't know these children. And if you ain't bring no plates, don't take no damn plates! [basketball bouncing] I'm in love with her. Yeah, when were y'all gonna tell me that? I knew we had our graduation, and you wanted to come out to them. So I wanted to give you all the space you needed. Mmm. But it doesn't matter now. She don't wanna marry me. Aw. [scoffs] It's just low-down, man. You know her, and you know me. You know we're good for each other. How can you say that, Davi? Huh? You've been lying to me this whole time. - I never lied to you. - I don't know who you are. So, all the weekends you were gone, you were with her? - Yes. - O... okay. So that sounds like you lied to me. You didn't tell me. She didn't want me to, but I wanted to. Oh, so you blame it all on her? No, I'm just telling you. [scoffs] You know what, man? I don't have anything else to say to you. You can go. Tim. Why are you still standing here, dude? - I... - Get up out of here. I'm your friend, and I love you. You love my whole family. You go ahead and be mad. You deserve that. I just... I wanted to be there for you. I didn't want to let you down. - Mmm. - I'm sorry. I'm your friend, and I wouldn't do anything to hurt you. [scoffs] Really? I love your mother. I'm sorry, but I do. I'm outta here. How you even say you wouldn't ever hurt me and you love my mother in the same sentence? What's wrong with you, man? - [gate slamming] - [scoffs] ♪ Every time I try to get a little high ♪ [knocking on door] Yeah, hold on. I'm just doin' some sewing. I can't stand it. Have no damn company at my house. Ok... Come on in. Hey! Hi. I'm so glad you came to see me. I was just sittin' here doin' nothin', waitin' for somebody to come talk to me. Come on in. Sit down. [clears throat] - Hmm. How you doin', baby? - I'm good. Good, good. Well, looks like I messed up my son's graduation celebration once again. You sure the hell did. You messed that shit up. [chuckling] No. I'm playin', girl. You ain't messed nothing up. All the sacrifices you made for that boy, hell. He'll be all right. He'll be fine. You sure about that? [Madea] Yes, honey. You don't remember the sacrifices you made? That's what a good parent do. From the time your baby born, you sacrificin'. From kindergarten, you sacrificin'. First grade all the way up through college, you been sacrificing. So after givin' them children all that time, it's time you take care of yourself and have you some damn fun. He gonna be fine. [chuckles softly] You talkin' about Davi? Yes, I am. I knew something was going on with you, the way you coming up in here, bouncing, talking about, "Hi." [babbling] I know you was making you happy or something. [chuckles] Well, it's not about him. You know? I mean, he's fun. But I'm just now starting to learn how to love and be happy with myself. Then you on the right track. That's exactly how it start. When you learn how to be happy with your damn self. Yeah, I just... I can't marry him. I mean, he's way too young. Honey, I been talking to that boy, and he seem very mature. You understand? Like he done been through some things. Sometimes trauma will grow you up faster than a 50-year-old. - How'd you meet him? - Oh, well... [Madea] Look at you smiling. [chuckles] Oh, there's a good story right there. Oh, it's really simple. Easy. I don't know where I... I went to visit Tim in college, and my son always late. So he was late, so I had to wait in the dorm, right? So obviously, Davi's there, and we just started talking. And I don't know, it was like... it was magical for some rea... Like, odd. Didn't know it at the time, but like, we just kept talking and... Next thing, he was tapping that ass? He tapping that ass? Tapping that ass, speaking that Iranian... [gibbering] - Was he tapping? [laughing] - [squeals] - It's just... - I'm just clownin' you, girl. I can't have that conversation with my grandmother. That's fine. That's fine. I can teach you a few things. - [laughs] - [Madea] But listen to me. I should've known when I first looked at him look at you. That boy love you. He does, I know. But his great-aunt Agnes said he's supposed to go to Ireland and run a farm. Like, a farm. He didn't tell me that. - I didn't know you know that. - Yeah, well, I know now. Agnes on that shit, just so you know. [scoffs] The shit I don't want her to be on is being mad at me. Yeah. Yeah, I get it. Sounds like you need to have a conversation. Talk to him about going to Iran and everything. Ireland. Uh-huh. - That's what I said. Ire-land. Ire-land. - Yep. You said it. Yeah, but, you know, talk to him about it. Maybe you can go over there with him. What? Baby, sometime you just gotta take a chance on love. Love is worth it. You really think I should do that? [Madea] What's keeping you here? Your child is graduating. You sacrificed for him. Hell. And that damn raggedy car, raggedy house of yours, that ain't worth keeping. You ain't got no man. Your job is piss-poor. - Why not just go on over there with him? - Yeah, my job is pretty bad. I don't know, but that farm might be worse. [scoffs] Last time a Black woman was on a farm, it didn't turn out too well, so... But just think about it. Especially in Iran. - Yeah, I have my freedom papers this time. - Mm-hmm. My question, though, was that something you would do, Madea? I mean, should I really do that? What do you mean, baby? That's love. Love is worth it. Hell, yeah. I wouldn't do it at this age, but when I was your age, I took some chances, and that's why I live my life, now I ain't got no regrets. I got out there, and I did the damn thing. Have fun. Just don't do nothin' that's gonna ruin your life. But at least take some chances on love. That's love, baby. That don't come around all the time. Yeah, I hear you. I'm just... Oh, I'm just scared. [exhales deeply] I'm 12 years older than him, you know? I don't think it's age you worried about. I think it's the heartbreak you done had. Let me tell you about heartbreak. It'll spit you out, make you not wanna love nobody. It'll make you not wanna trust nobody ever. That's what I tell women when they get heart broke. If you get your heart broke, please have the courage to try it again. If that person break your heart, have the courage to try it again. Next person break your heart, have the courage to try it again. I'm gonna tell you, you keep getting your heart broke, pretty soon you gonna run up on a heart surgeon who know how to fix all them breaks you done been through. That's why you can't just stop, baby. Love is worth fighting for. Do you hear me? Yeah. So I get it. Get your heart broke, don't wanna trust nobody else. Buildin' all them walls. Let me tell you something about a wall. It'll keep everything out. Stop building walls and build some fences so you can look over and see if that's who you wanna see or not. Do you hear me? You're so wise. Thank you. I know. It's the weed. I'mma tell you this now, speaking of wisdom, when you get married, make sure you say "I do" to more than one person. "I do" to one person ain't gonna work. You gotta say "I do" to several people. You understand? No, I do not. That's why so many people are getting divorced these days. They just say "I do" to one person. Okay, I... I'mma take back what I said about you being wise 'cause I feel like you're going off the rails. If you was high, you'd be with me. But let me break it down for you. When you marry somebody, ten years later, that person gonna be somebody else. Ten years after that, somebody else. People evolve. They change. That's why so many people renew their vows, 'cause the person they say "I do" to ain't the same person they with now. Do you hear what I'm telling you? Take a chance on love. You gon' be all right. That boy too young to know, but you old enough to understand. You old enough to know what I'm sayin'. So, baby, y'all take your time, you hear? Now, if you don't mind, I was sewin'. I was, uh, net... net... I was net... Needle netting, and I'd like to get back to it. - Would you mind just...? - Yes. - Thank you. I love you. - I love you too. You've been here a long time. It's been over a day. - Almost time to go. [laughs] - All right. I figured my time was up. - Yeah, but I love you. - I love you. - Talk to that boy, you hear me? - I will. - [Madea] Okay. Talk to him. - All right. Enjoy your weed. Eh... Oh... How you know? You think I didn't smell that? I got a prescription 'cause it ain't legal in Georgia yet. Don't be telling your sister. Damn cop. [sighs] This park close at nine o'clock, son. Nine o'clock. They trying to gentle-fy the whole neighborhood. Yeah. Gentrified? Yeah, that's when they try to make everything gentle. Like gentrified? That's what I said, gentle. They gon' make it gentle. It used to be rough. That's why I go out and shoot in the air. I don't want nobody to move here to make it gentle. - I like it rough, like it used to be. - Got it. They come in here and raise the property taxes and everything. Take over your damn house. Put basketball courts in, change the neighborhood. Build pretty house all around. I ain't selling shit. Gentrification. Whatever it is, I ain't selling. I'mma hold on to what I paid for. - Got you. - Mm-hmm. Uh, Madea, is my mom still up? Why? I gotta talk to her. No, your mama done had a rough day. Go on home. - What about me? - What about you? Don't go upsetting her. I'm not. I just wanna talk to her. You go home, get ready for your graduation. Learn your speech, you understand? Don't worry about this. Parents are not perfect. Parents make all kind of mistakes. Your mom, your dad. Children think, "My mom should've been better. My dad should've been better." They did the best they could. Just growing up, raising children, nobody tell them how to do nothing. Sometime people just doin' the best they can, you understand? - Yes, ma'am. - You had no idea they was together? No, I mean, like, he... he talks about her a lot, but I... I... I just never put it together. He talks about your mama a lot? Yeah. - And... and... - I mean... You didn't think something's goin' on? Let me understand. Two children in college talkin' about your mama, a man, and you don't think something's goin' on? [scoffs] And, baby, you goin' to law school? - [scoffs] - Listen to me. Do me a favor. Don't try no cases right now. Don't do no criminal cases. Get some slip and falls. Something you can handle. - I'm just gonna go talk to her. - No. I said it. You ain't gonna talk to her. You gon' go home and rest for tomorrow. Make all of us proud with your big ol' speech. I... I'm gonna go stay at a friend's house. I... I can't even look at Davi right now. So come on, come on. Go on home. Come on, come on. Leave that basketball. I don't want people saying we stole it from the gentri-people. Gentri-people trying to steal everything. - Open the gate for a lady. - [Tim] Yes, ma'am. - [Madea] Pull it this way. - [Tim] This way? [Madea] I can't get out of there. Pull it this way. This ain't going through there. Go on home now. [Tim] Okay. [crowd cheering] [announcer] Derick Reed. [crowd cheering] [announcer] Tory Edwards. The graduation's taking a long time. You like my dress? Oh, Miss Madea, you look very nice. Thank you. Thank you so much. I try. I got this from Aretha Franklin. - It's beautiful. - What? She willed it to me. Aretha knew fashion, baby. - Wow. - She willed it after she died. Yes, indeed. How's your mama doin'? She still has her knickers... Her panties in a bunch. - Okay, panties, baby. Panties. - She'll be fine. How you doin', Agnes? I'm fine. Don't look like you enjoying yourself, twisted up in the mouth. No, no, no. [splutters] It's not true. The sooner this is over, the better. We can all get on that plane. - Including Davi. - [camera clicks] Mmm. Mmm. I think it got chilly over here in the hot sun. - I'm sorry you didn't have a good time. - Oh, I did. I did have a good time. I just... I... I wasn't expecting this. - [Cora] Wait a minute, that's my baby. - This? [Madea] Incoming. Davi O'Malley! - Yes! - [crowd cheering] - Proud of him. - Well-done, Davi. [shouting indistinctly] Go, Davi! Okay. He know. - [Ellie] He isn't even looking at him. - I know. I ruined his graduation too. No, you didn't. You ain't ruined nothing. That boy be all right. He better be glad. All that money we done spent putting him through sc... I spent $37.49 putting that boy through school. Timothy Marshall! [crowd cheering] [Richard] You did it! You did it! That's my baby! That's my baby boy! [cheering, whooping] Yes! Go, Tim! [laughs] [Madea] Y'all get the picture? Smile. - He ain't smile? Did he get the diploma? - Yes. Great. I'm getting ready to go and whoop her ass. [Cora] Madea, would you just stay seated? Don't do that at the graduation. - [Cora] Yes! - Don't do that. - That's right! - You already ruined two dinners. - Oh my God. - You got to act up everywhere you go. - You know what you ruined? - [Brown] What? My appetite with that ugly ass suit. Please be quiet. Will you stop? He has to say his speech. I'm tired of you talking to me like a child. - I don't meant to ta... - I'mma take you to the cane. I don't mean to talk to you like a kid, Madea, but this is a big day for him! - [Bam] The way she actin'. - [Madea] Shut up. [announcer] Now, we are pleased to present the valedictorian of our graduating class, Timothy Marshall. [crowd cheering] - Yeah! Valedictorian! - That's my son! That's my son! - That's my son! - He about to say his speech. - He about to say his speech. - [Richard] That's mine. "That's your son." He done talking about that's his son. Well, it ain't your son. You ain't did a thing for him. Talk about your son. Hush! Hush! [sighs] - [Madea] He ain't saying his speech? - [Cora] He ripped it up. [Bam] What he gon' say now? Maybe he got it memorized. He got it memorized. Maybe so. [sighs] I was gonna get up here and talk about life and all of the great things that await us. About jobs, about hope. But these last two days, you guys, I was lied to by my best friend. Well, I shouldn't say lied to. Deceived by him and my mother. - [Cora] Oh. - [Richard] Yep. [Madea] Ooh. - You see, I didn't know they were dating. - Oh my gosh. - Put all our business... - He putting all this in the street. He don't have to say all that. - [Madea] Are you recording it? - Yeah. [splutters] I spent all of last night mad. Mad at them. Mad that I didn't know. But then I... I... I realized that I, too, am harboring a secret. At... at... at least I thought it was a secret. My whole family already knew. Yeah, we knew. We knew. You see, I'm gay, and I was really worried about what they would think. I didn't care what I thought. When I came out to them, they showed me so much love, and it... it just made me realize how fortunate I am to have them. And so, as we start this bright future of ours, I just want to take the time to thank my mother, who always loved me, stood by me, worked, did whatever she could to help put me through school. - And to my dad, thank you. - [Madea] He ain't done nothing for you. - [sighs] Madea. - What? Agree. Even though they were divorced and he didn't have much, he still tried to be there for me. And to my best friend Davi, who never once judged me but was always a friend. Even though he was sneaking around with my mother. [Madea] Damn. - [Cora] Why does he keep saying that? - I mean... - [Bam] 'Cause he was. - [Madea] He was whoring around. He talk too damn much. What goes on in the house stay in the house. [Cora] Amen! I thought about what kind of guy he is. He's mature. He's a good man. And I thought to myself, how lucky am I that the two people I love the most in this world found each other because of me. Would I rather have known? - Yes. - [chuckles] [Tim] But I'm okay with it. And I wanna apologize to them for how I acted. A future isn't a future without a past. And I'm just so thankful that I have a family. For my great-grandmother, Madea. My grandma, Cora, Mr. Brown, Aunt Ellie, Aunt Bam. And of course, Uncle Joe. [Madea] Baby, Joe ain't here. He was too high to come. And I just wanna let the world know that I love them, and I'm so thankful to be born to them. And as we start this future, I start mine standing on the shoulders of regular, hardworking people who didn't have much. They are giants to me. And I love them with my whole heart. Thank you. - [crowd cheering] - ["Pomp and Circumstance" playing] Beautiful. - Tim, Tim, Tim! - [mouthing] Thank you, Jesus. [mouthing] Yes. [students cheering] Hallelujah! - That was all right. That was beautiful. - That was beautiful. - Yes, it was. - [Madea] Yeah. - [Davi] Hey. - Hey. Come with me. I thought I was the one with the big secret. Oh. [scoffs] We didn't wanna hurt you, baby. Do you love him? Yes, I do. Do you love her? Yes, I do. You should've told me. I... I know. I'm sorry. We're sorry. I'm sorry. Look, trust me. We were gonna tell you. Don't... don't be sorry. I... I know what it's like to have a secret, and I feel so good now that my family knows. And I... I don't want you to hide it. I'm so proud of you, baby. I stay proud of you. Come here. - I love you. - [Laura] I love you. [Tim, Laura exhale] - I'm not calling you Dad. - I wouldn't want you to. And... and if you hurt her... - Hey. - I wouldn't do that. But it doesn't matter now. She won't marry me. What? Mom, you... you just said you loved him. What's the problem? [scoffs] He has to go back to Ireland. His great-aunt made that very clear to me. What? Is that why you said no? Well, I don't want us to be a rift in your family. - Don't you... - Oh, Davi, son, congratulations. You did the family and the whole country of Ireland proud. Thank you. Aunt Agnes, I need to speak with you. There's nothing left to be said, son. I'm delighted to be here. And I'm delighted you were here. Well, there we go. Mummy, will you let Davi speak, please. - Thanks, Cathy. I... - Go on, say what you want to say. - I knew I was... - Wait, hold on a second. I forgot your card. - Here's your graduation present. Open it. - What... What's this? - It's your ticket to Ireland. Canceled. - What? - But... - But nothing. Davi, you know how much I want you to come home, and you know how much I respect family tradition. But a wise woman told me, "Children have to live their own lives. They have to make their own decisions." And she said something about being a Black whore's... Anyway, that's irrelevant. The thing is, your life is here, son. And I think your happiness is here too. - [chuckles] - And that's all I want for you. [Brown] Oh, that's good. That's, like... That's so good. - [sniffles] - [sighs] [chuckles] So you don't mind if we get married? I don't think that's a question for Aunt Agnes. I think that's a question for the beautiful lady right here. What you got to say? Laura... Don't you get down on your knee again. She already said no. Yeah, you done embarrassed yourself once. - Would you two hush? - But Cora... - You wasting time. - He can propose and marry my daughter. I'm keeping him from embarrassing himself. Yeah, I'mma take a picture. Hush. Go ahead, baby. - Do it. Do it - Just ask. - [Cora] I'mma see if she gon' say yes. - Laura. [breathes deeply] Will you marry me? [Brown] Shh. Yes. - Yes! - Yes! [Cora] Yes, we'll marry you. Yes, we'll marry you. I want you to tie that knot. And y'all will go to holy mattresmony. - What are you gonna tell his grandpa? - Nothing. Nothing? His granddad is in jail. He was found in a hotel room naked with a drunk sheep. - Shut... - [Cora, Brown] What? - A sheep? - [Agnes] Hmm. - That's nasty. - Yeah. He brought the sheep in hisself? - No, no. It was a... it was a... a blind date. - Oh. I done seen that movie and the sequel. - [Agnes chuckles] - [Cora] Ooh!

Oh, that's hos, plural. Okay, yes. I get it. Thank you so much for the talks, and thank you for the recipe. Oh, you welcome. Don't go to jail. You get five to ten if you make too much.

Maybe Mrs. Brown and Madea do Europe. - Ooh, I love that. - [chuckles] I can't wait to show you my beloved Ireland. Oh, you had me till you started talking about Iran. Baby, I can't go to Iran. - Ireland. - I know, too much sand in that Iran-land. Fuck's sake. - Whatever. - Mmm. - Right. Well, I better go. - Yeah. Yeah. - Thanks for everything. - You travel safe.
