Celebrating 60 years of TBS This film is based on a true story... ...that took place some 400 years ago. Takamatsu, 1582 Milord! Come down! Now Okayama Prefecture Milord! The dike might break! Come down! Your servant Ishida begs you! You think so? What say you... ...Otani? Should it cost my life... ...Otani will save you! And you, Natsuka? Have no fear. It cost 8,000 gold kan. So says Natsuka! It won't break. Yes! Power comes from one thing! Gold! That I will show you now! Unleash the flood! How about that?! Look at that, Ishida! Look at it! Ishida? That's it, Otani! That's how I want to fight! That's the way I want to wage war! His three vassals stayed loyal... ...as Hideyoshi gradually subjugated Japan's warlords. 8 years later Named Regent by the Emperor as he unified the entire land... ...Hideyoshi now turned to his last powerful enemy... ...the Hojo Clan of the Eastern Plain. From its main fortress at Odawara... ...the clan ruled 20 lesser castles. Kyoto, 1590 Jurakudai Palace To preserve The Emperor's peace... ...the Regent will on March 1st send forces to suppress the Hojo Clan. With all dispatch... ...Lords Maeda and Uesugi will advance... ...from the north. Lord Tokugawa, from the east. Lord Kuki will proceed by sea. Your Highness! Will Lord Ishida remain behind again? This time I will give Ishida an army of his own. With 20,000 men... ...he will attack the Hojo vassals. You will proceed with me to Odawara. You will take Tatebayashi Castle in Joshu... ...and then you will destroy Oshi Castle in Bushu. With Satake and the others, you will have 20,000 men. 20,000 men, for me? Those castles only have 2,000 riders between them. Ishida! I can't have those great lords thinking of you as my tea-boy! Show them Ishida Mitsunari can fight! Then you will command the respect due a vassal of mine. Have no fear! These are country castles. The very sight of 20,000 will unman them. Oshi is an unusual castle. It's in the middle of a marsh. 'The floating castle', they call it. Shall we see if it really floats? Thus Hideyoshi laid his plans for an attack on Oshi Castle... ...in the present-day city of Gyoda, north of Tokyo in Saitama Prefecture. THE FLOATING CASTLE Where did that fool get to? Was Nagachika here?! Lord Bone? Not at this gate, sir. Tell the Inner Bailey if you see him. I salute the Nagano Gate! Masaki of Tanba passes! It's Lord Tanba! Enough! How many times must I speak?! Reverend! Reverend! Ah, Tanba... Nagachika? Bone? I don't know. But I should box your ears for speaking on horseback to a priest. Like I did when you and Bone used to steal my persimmons. I wish you would not call him 'Bone'. He is cousin to the castle's Lord. At least I don't call him 'Bonehead'. All right, you win. They're trampling old Tahei's wheat in Shimooshi village. He might be there. 'When the wheat's so lovely 'Why tramp it down? 'Yatto, yatto, yo-sa, yatto! 'You have to tramp it down 'You have to tramp it down 'Or it won't grow right' Chiyo... ...don't even look at Lord Bone. I know. If a samurai wants to help then let him! Kazo! Are you crazy? They let him help last year... ...and it took three days to replant! Chidori! Hey, Samurai! Don't just sit there, come and help. You think so? Yes, I probably should. Come on. Do it right! Let's go! One, two... Lord Bone! I made a boo-boo! Hopeless! Sorry, sorry! Do it right, damn it! Kazo! Sorry, sorry! Nagachika! Tanba! Want to help? A messenger's come from Odawara. Get on! What do they want? What do you think? They want the Lord of the Castle to add his forces to theirs. I salute the Main Gate! Come on! Milord! Stand aside! Sorry! Well parried! Silence! Yukie, this is not the time! You told me to try to catch you off your guard, Uncle. Lord Nagachika, you need to move out of the way! Sorry, sorry! Lord Bone... Will the Regent attack us, too? Yes. And with more men than Lord Uesugi eight years ago. We'll be fine. I am the War God personified, the military genius... ...Sakamaki Yukie. As if you'd ever been in a war. Coming through. Hello, Tanba! Izumi... Are you ready to hand over Lord Maeda's red spear? That will mean you have become First Among Warriors. Not a chance. What?! I'll bet your wife cried again when you left. Yes, she tried to stop me with her tears... ...but I spoke firmly to her. Where blood swirls with powder smoke, there you will find... ...Shibasaki of Izumi! Gentlemen! Shall we stop boasting and go inside? Our House of Hojo has broken with the Regent. The lords of Hojo castles are to come to Odawara... ...at the head of their forces. I understand. When the House of Narita is ready, we will come. When will you come, and with how many men? Cousin... May I speak? What is it? Could we not continue taking sides... ...with neither Hojo nor Regent? What?! Nagachika! You damn fool! To whom does our house owe its existence... ...if not the Hojo?! Apologize to its messengers! Apologize, Nagachika! I humbly apologize... ...for the foolishness of my son. I beg your mercy upon his father. In accordance with ancient law, Lord Narita Ujinaga will bring... ...half his strength, 500 men. He will leave today. Well spoken! We will inform Odawara immediately. So we fight the Regent? Why the long faces? We fight! The Regent will send forces against us as well. Deepen the moat. Strengthen the... Lord Yasusue! Father! Father! Father! Tanba! This is my fault! Nagachika! Settle down, will you! Quiet, Nagachika. Father! Well! Are you still alive, Uncle? Hey! Mother! Milady? You're as beautiful as ever. Flatterer! So you intend to spend time in the women's quarters? Ending a life of battle lying on a tatami mat... ...is a little indulgent, I must say. Lord of the Castle, ready your men. My brother would have done the same. Do not speak to me of my father. Milord! Milord! Nagachika... He'll be fine. Don't worry. Hey... That woman... is she real? She's not for the likes of you. She's a real warrior princess. Two years ago, before you left home to live in the castle... ...she killed a retainer who'd raped a peasant girl. I forget his name, but he could fight, and she cut him right down. Over a peasant? His family demanded satisfaction, and wanted her dead. Lord Nagachika calmed them down, although I don't know how. Really? I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth. Since then she's been in love with Nagachika. Milord! Milord! Milord! Milord! Why?! Why do we have to stay here?! Allow me to join your force! I know what I'm doing. I'm going to write secretly to the Regent. Milord! Calm down. When I get to Odawara... ...I will write through a friend I exchange poems with. If the Regent's troops besiege this castle... ...surrender immediately. Open the castle to them without striking a blow?! Yes. Why didn't we decide to do that from the start? How will it look if we don't even go to Odawara? We have a duty to the Hojo. We can't surrender without performing it. Quit before the first arrow?! That's why I'm not taking you to Odawara! How can we win? The Hojo have the whole land against them. Can Oshi Castle fight back with only 500 men? Izumi! You are absolutely right, Milord. Tell no one of this. Not even my uncle. Yes, sir. Odawara will send messengers announcing the start of hostilities. Prepare as if for a siege. But do not kill even one of the Regent's soldiers. The Lord of the Castle attends! Forward! Pull-out! Pull-out! I'm leaving! You can't do that! Squire! You're pulling out on us?! Shut up! It's a waste! So what should we do? Now what? Lord Izumi says there's no need to stock up on rice... ...and Squire Sakamaki disagrees. Is that so? Get back to work! No. Don't! Izumi can handle this! 'Military genius', huh? Don't make me laugh! I'm a genius of strategy, not hand-to-hand combat! And your strategy is stocking rice when we're not fighting? Not fighting? Milord is dead! You two just killed him! Say a word of this to anyone, and you die! Hide it, and it'll spread. I'll tell them everything, and they'll understand. No! Don't worry. We're not going to fight? Well... Wait! I'll tell them! The Lord of the Castle has gone to Odawara, but he's writing... ...to the Regent. We... ...will not fight. But... ...if the House of Hojo learns this, the Lord of the Castle will die! So... ...prepare for a siege! Come on. I'll bet that hurt. I've never fought. Give me a war! I'll show what I can do! Eventide! Was there trouble outside? Yes. A falling off in morale, so we tightened the reins. Lord Yasusue said earlier... ...'Nagachika is a buffoon, so after I am dead... '...Tanba is to take over. 'And he is not to refuse just because he and Nagachika are boyhood friends.' Madam... Yes? Messengers from Odawara. I'll see them. They saw our preparations... ...and left, saying the Regent is at Hakone, near Odawara. They left without talking to us? Just like that fool said. Tanba... ...is there fighting at Odawara? Probably. 12 kilometers west of Odawara Castle Hakone Hot Spring This is a fine hot spring! I will make it flourish. By your leave! Ishida! Come on in! Not right now. Natsuka, do we have enough rice for the soldiers? The soldiers' rice? 200,000 measures have been shipped and distributed... ...to the generals. Those fools at Odawara... ...think I'll pull out once it's spring-planting time. I'll bring bath-girls and merchants... ...enough to keep us entertained if this siege lasts our whole lives! Well! Isn't this nice! Ishida! The generals who will join you have arrived with their men. In that case... Take them... and head for those castles. Yes, sire! Aren't you going, too? I expected this, so before I came... ...I told my retainers to be ready. Otani... ...Ishida is good with finances, but he has no sense of strategy. But many love him for his child-like sense of fair play. You most of all? The House of Narita has written to me. So Oshi Castle is ours? Please... ...make sure Ishida comes back victorious. And don't tell him I told you to. 'Spring is here 'Here at last 'Plant the seed 'Anything you want' Lord Bone... Lord Bone! Need help? No, no. What will you do if the castle falls? I don't know. Farm? You'd never do it. All you're good at is strolling around in samurai trousers! Yeah, you're right. Hi, Rikichi! Rikichi! Go see Lord Bone. Are you out here again?! What's wrong? Plenty! A messenger from Tatebayashi says the Regent's army's already there! That's only three leagues away! Make way! Make way! Reporting! Our vanguard has reached Tatebayashi Castle. It is open to us! Without even a parley? With a force this large against it? Of course. Is this how men behave, Otani? Do they so easily lose heart in the face of money and power? Only those with those things would ask. Forward! Ma! Come on! Kazo! Kazo! The smart townsfolk are leaving! Bonehead's lying! There'll be war, and we're going! Where? Anywhere! Come on! You go, then! You're not afraid of war... ...you just hate samurai! You hate me for being violated by one! Well, I'm not leaving the Princess, or Lord Bone, who saved her! I've put that behind me! No, you haven't. Chidori! Do what you like. All of you! 'Wine is a kind of medicine 'And things go best when people are kind...' We're set to hand over. Give me a drink. We're pouring our own. Oh, really? Guzzling saké like that with an enemy advancing on us! Lord Nagachika! Are you so happy to be surrendering? What's the point in getting all upset? 'The Monkey' won't treat us badly if we don't fight him. 'It's fun dangling your flask...' It's not just you who's angry! Look. There must be 20,000 of them. 500 against 20,000... They say this hill is the tomb of an ancient prince. Uesugi tried to take the castle from up here. Call Natsuka. He'll be our emissary. You're sending him? That's right. You know better than that! He's nothing without the Regent. Like me? No! He's strong before the weak, and weak before the strong. That's what he's like. That's why I chose him. Tanba! The Monkey's emissary is here. Take him to the Great Hall. The Regent's army is here. There is something I must say. Enough, Tanba. Izumi... ...Yukie... ...and all you others... ...you have done well. I believe the Lord of the Castle intends to go over to the Regent. That's fine. Open the castle! Swear fealty to the Regent. Beg him to confirm you in your domains. I have inconvenienced you all... ...by being stubborn. It grieves me that things have come to this! Princess... Sakamaki Yukie... ...loves you. All right. Thank you. About time! You offer no refreshments, and you keep us waiting here?! Think of us as country folk... ...and grant us your indulgence. The Castellan is confined to his bed... ...and it took time to inform him. I apologize. Who are you? I am Masaki Toshihide of Tanba. I serve the House of Narita. This is Narita Nagachika, son of Yasusue... ...the Castellan here. I am Natsuka Masaie. This Castellan of yours... ...is somewhat lax in his duties, to rest on such an occasion. This is who they send? War or peace: which is it? Surrender, and you will be secure in your domains. You will march on Odawara. Resist, and our 20,000 will crush you. You may choose as you wish, but I require an answer. And make it fast! I haven't eaten yet. Oh, and the House of Narita has a princess named Kai. The Regent gets her. My mind was not made up, but now it is. Then speak. We fight. I'm sorry? I said we will see you on the field of battle! This is Narita's answer? Nagachika! Wait! Wait! A moment! Nagachika! Come with me! Yukie! Are you crazy?! Milord! Enough is enough. Enough is enough? Enough of what? Surrendering! What are you talking about? We've done what we had to! We can't fight the Regent. You agreed to that yourself. And now I don't, all right?! Grow up! They threaten us with 20,000 men and ask if we want war or peace. The truth is, they're sure we're going to fold. Well, I'm not surrendering to men like that! Swallow it. You'll be confirmed in your castle and your domains. Accept it. I won't accept what I can't accept! Those with weapons trample those without. The powerful lead the powerless by the nose! What kind of a world is that?! I won't accept it. I won't take it! You may say that's just how things are... ...but I won't stand for it! Let's do it! Sakamaki's with you. You just want a fight! Beppu's with you! So is Honjo! Hold it! Calm down! Not so fast. It's the strong who rule. That's just how it is. So what do you say, Tanba? Do you really mean this? What the hell. OK, we'll do it. Right! Let's do it! Well? Has the man made up his mind? He has. We all argued with him... ...but he is very stubborn. He will not listen to us. What? Thus... ...as the man has said, we have resolved to fight. You'll fight an army... ...of 20,000 men?! Prepare to feel the spears of the Warriors of the East. Really?! They were arguing at first, but finally they said they'd fight! What?! They're crazy! They did? They said they'll fight? All of you! Prepare for a Council of War! Yes! This is how it has to be! That's how men should be! I'd almost given up on them! That was a test? You sent Natsuka to try and get them to fight? Everyone, make a pledge to the Castellan. Pledging what? Your loyalty to Nagachika as Castellan... ...and as the Marshal of our forces. I agree. And I! You've decided to fight? Against the orders of the Lord of the Castle. My husband is a coward. Leave things here to us, and go to your Council of War. We'll decide who holds which gate. Are there any preferences? The Nagano Gate. It's a long approach. Tanba, you can have the fusiliers. I'll take the Sama Gate. Yukie, you stay back. What?! I won't need you. You jump in wherever you see trouble. All right. All I'll need is 50 old peasants and a few arrows. Yeah? That'll be more than enough. Honjo, the Shimooshi gate. Narita Tosa, the Sarao Gate. Yokota, the Kitaya Gate. They outnumber us, but we have the advantage... ...of terrain and of fighters. We'll beat them with strategies all our own! The House of Narita has resolved to fight the Regent. All the peasants should move inside the castle walls. Wait too long, and you'll burn with your villages. Didn't you say you wouldn't fight? You object? I'm not coming inside. We're not fools. The castle will lose. You want to gamble with the lives of everybody in it! Show more respect for my rank! Well, don't you? No. Then who up and decided you're going to fight? Well?! Nagachika! The man's a hopeless case! Well, if Lord Bone's going to fight, I guess we'll just have to help him. Right? Don't forget your armor and your weapons. You still have those hidden away? We're peasants now, but our blood... ...is the blood of the Warriors of the East! Show more respect. I will. Izumi... ...use that. The red spear? Give it to me after the battle. Nagachika! It's Bone. 3,000 of them! Even the kids are looking tough. I am Narita Nagachika! The last words of my father, Yasusue... ...were to open the castle! But I have asked the impossible... ...and we're going to fight! Everyone, I'm sorry! What are you saying? You'll demoralize them! Father! Bone's crying, you know. His father's dead. Father! Bone... Nagachika! Stand up! Milord... Nagachika! Raise our war cry! Aye! Aye! Hurray! Shout it out! Aye! Aye! Hurray! Aye! Aye! Hurray! Was making them our enemies really a good idea? Careful! Don't drop them. Take the barrels. What's going on?! Stay back! It's dangerous. Leave this to us, Squire Yukie, and get some rest. No, I can't sleep. I'm told the emissary said I was to be the Monkey's concubine. That's right. So you decided to fight because of me? That's not true. Yes, it is. It's not, I said. It is! Say it! Say it! Say it! Fool! Let us fight as befits soldiers of he who rules all. So those are the soldiers of he who rules all... Their fusiliers are in front. Here we go. Forward! Advance! Fusiliers, forward! Lord Tanba! Mount up behind the riders with your guns! Hurry! Get back! No foot sloggers on my horse! Get back! Get away! Any more talk about cavalry pride... ...and I'll kill you. Hurry! Prepare to fire! Get on! Aren't you taking anyone? Not me. Open the gate! Yes, sir! Wait, sir! Don't fire yet! Come on, shoot! Fire! What the...?! I told you! Mounted fusiliers?! Oh, no! Fire! What are you doing?! Fire! Natsuka! Reporting! Lord Tanba has engaged the enemy before the Sama Gate! Noted. Reporting! Lords Honjo and Izumi... ...have engaged at the Shimooshi and Nagano Gates! Noted. Does anywhere look bad? It has just begun, sir! Take aim! Fire! Take aim! Fire! Stay where you are! Now! Break down the gate! Go! Smash it! Here they come! The gate won't hold! That's the idea! Marshal! Reporting! The first Nagano Gate has fallen! They're attacking the second! Noted. At last! That Lord Izumi is all mouth! Marshal! I'm on my way. What are you doing here?! I didn't call for you! Oh? Maeno Yozaemon! First through the gate! Wow! You have had the misfortune to attack the Nagano Gate! That man with the red spear! Isn't that the 'black demon' from eight years ago? Masaki of Tanba? For honor! What?! One side! Masaki of Tanba! Yamada Tatewaki, Marshal of Horse to the House of Natsuka... ...will match spears with you! 'Natsuka'? Lord Natsuka came as their emissary... I deem you worthy! Have at me! He flinched. Lord Izumi! No! Get back! Pull back! Push! Push! Lord Izumi! Are you ready for help? Nowhere near it! He'll never admit it. How 'bout that, huh?! That long approach is killing us. They're firing stones! Release! Charge! Take their heads! Cut them down! Kill them! Bring the barrels! Anytime you're ready! Shut up! Lord Izumi! Pull back! It's dangerous out there! Yukie! Let's see your famous strategy! All right! Now! Now's our chance! After them! Now! What's this?! Oil! It's oil! Someone's been studying! Messenger! Make way! Messenger! Messenger! This was thrown out of the castle! 'Fire attack by Sakamaki Yukie'... Round 1 goes to them. Retreat. Retreat! Retreat! Had enough? Then write this down! Our Marshal is Narita Nagachika! Commander at the Nagano Gate... ...is Shibasaki of Izumi, First Among Warriors! Spoken like a true warrior! Otani Yoshitsugu will record your name... ...and that of Sakamaki Yukie, your fire warrior! Riceballs! Riceballs! Chidori! Grandpa! 'All is void, and all grief borne away to the distant shore of nirvana...' Masaki, the boy general! Reverend! We won! Well, get it over with, will you? I missed my morning nap! I got three of them today! I got four! You did? Well done, all of you! Miss! Miss! Give me one. No! You just rode on a horse. Chidori! These are for the men who had to work! Well, I did a bit of work. Really? Yes, really. Thanks! They've got the spirit. We can win this. Tanba! Yo. We held all the gates. Victory! Princess... go tell Milady. Tanba, well done. Excuse me, Tanba, but I'm going to lie down a bit. It's like fighting bandits! You never know what they'll do. They said their Marshal's name was Narita Nagachika. It's quite something, a general using every trick that way. He didn't look like a general. But I have the perfect strategy to use against such a man. Gentlemen! Ishida will attack by flood! How? You will receive instructions on where you are to deploy. If you do that, you're sure to win. Why didn't you start with that?! I withdraw! You leave no glory to our allied generals. You must respect their feelings. This castle will fall by flood! By flood we will win. Hojo Castle, Odawara Rejoice! Oshi has won its first battle. Ishida's been driven back. They're holding him off. Narita... ...have your men fight like that... ...for this castle as well. I will! Yasutaka... ...why are they fighting? And even worse, winning! What will the Regent think?! Name? Kisuke. Name? Yohei. Laborers wanted! The Tone and Arakawa Rivers... ...ran north and south of Oshi Castle. Ishida ordered them dammed and a dike built between them. Build it up higher! We need more logs! With work proceeding day and night... ...the dike extended 28 kilometers. This is different! Attack by flood. The Regent did that eight years ago down in Takamatsu. The castle had no choice but surrender. It doesn't bother you? No. You're not too bright sometimes. Why? Who's building that dike? Peasants wanting money, I guess. They spent lots at Takamatsu, too. Then we have absolutely nothing to worry about. A truly dedicated enemy demands an onslaught of force and money. That is how I make war. As you wish. Do it the way you want. Unleash the flood! What's that? Run! Quick! Run! Quick! Ma, the water! The water! Get inside! It's higher there! Run! Hurry! Yukie, what's wrong?! The Inner Bailey's full! If we fill the residence we can get 3,000 in! Tanba! Tanba! The Second Bailey's flooding! Come in! Peasants, everyone! Why aren't you coming inside?! All of you! Come in! What's the matter? Hyah! Princess! Wear your sandals inside! If I track mud in alone, Tanba will yell at me again! Inside! So what will you do now... ...you warriors of the floating castle? Dad, I want to go home! I want to go home! It's no good! We're beat! What did you say?! This isn't good. It's the paddies. Their paddies are flooded so they're angry at us. The water could reach us by tomorrow. Reporting! There are bodies washing up outside the gate! Isn't that your dagger? You gave it away? Rikichi... They said they were leaving so I gave it to them. And let them leave? The baby liked my face. They'd bring him when he wouldn't stop crying. Bastards! Killing peasants who've surrendered. And women and children! Let's break this siege. I've made up my mind. I'm going to break this siege. How?! I'm going to play dirty! What's going on? Look. What's that? Now what? Gentlemen of the West! I will perform for you now... ...the 400 year-old... ...Rice Paddy Dance of Oshi! It's Lord Bone! Look! As you rest from your war by water... ...enjoy it to the full! 'Last night I drank too much' 'Last night he drank too much' 'I peed my bed' 'Peed his bed' 'Peed my bed' 'I hung it to dry so my wife wouldn't see 'And the Monkey of the West took a great big pee! 'Whoops!' 'Monkey of the West'? He means the Regent! The nerve! That's his idea? Dancing? 'In surprise, I peed again 'Whoops! 'Whoops-a-daisy!' Hey! Princess! What's he up to? Very interesting folk. They're mocking our attack. 'Not to be outdone 'I took a great big pee!' He would make a festival out of this, wouldn't he. Go closer. He's coming in closer. How brave of him! Sir! Natsuka, look! Only a great warrior dances... ...before 20,000 of the enemy. 'How does powder turn the water white? 'Do you agree? 'Yes, yes, yes! 'Yes?' 'Yes, yes, yes!' Who is that man? Go get one of their peasants and ask. There's no need of that. The man dancing for you... ...is Narita Nagachika, Marshal of the Narita forces! Look at him! It's like we weren't at war. No wonder Uncle Masaki gets mad at him. He's trying to get himself killed! 'How does powder turn the water white? 'I like you 'I love you 'I like you 'I love you 'Tonight let's take a great big pee 'Tonight let's take a great big pee' Sir! A message from the Regent. This. He's coming here. What?! To view the attack. Why would he want to do that? Bring the sharpshooter! No! You can't shoot him! Why not? Kill their marshal, and the war is over. What do you know?! Look at the soldiers. Both sides love him. He's a natural leader. He wants us to bear a grudge. He wants to get killed so our soldiers get mad. They all love that fool! He knows that. That's a real dirty trick! I'll stop him. Move in! Open up! The sharpshooter. Shoot that man. Yes, sir. Think about this! We could end up in a trap! Tanba! Princess?! Go back! Nagachika... Hurry! No! Hey! Seize him! Forgive me! Take your hands off me! Listen! Narita has joined us! What?! Ujinaga, the Lord of Oshi Castle, has written to the Regent! There's no need to fight. Fire. Milord! Nagachika! Nagachika! Yukie! Keep hold of her! Let go! Let go! Bonehead... Now we've put our foot in it. Wait! Please! They shot Lord Bone! We want revenge! Wait, will you! Nagachika? Lord Nagachika! Ow ow ow ow ow! Is everyone all right? Stay still. They all want to kill the Regent. Fools, all of them! Just as you intended. Well... You stupid fool! How could you do that?! Stupid! Stupid! You fool! Princess! Izumi, get her off! Princess! Why did you do that?! Tell me! Hey! Hey! Is that Kazo, from Shimooshi? Tome, from Mochida? Why are you here? To break this dike, of course. Those bastards went and shot Lord Bone! These men are from Sama village. Then help. I thought you didn't like samurai. Shut up! It's breaking up! Hey! Run! The water's going down! It's dropping! It is?! Quick! The water... It's going down! The water's going down! The peasants outside are with us, too. They're letting what's left of the water out. They'll be coming. When the water goes down below your posts... ...get back there! Return to your posts! The floating castle... Just as the Regent said. Open up! Sir... ...this man has confessed to breaching the dike. Is this so? Talk! Do you think we'd stand by while you shot Bone... ...and flooded our fields?! You deserve it! What?! You filthy peasant! Stop! A man who cannot be bought... Did Narita plan on this? Release him! When the water clears... ...commence an all-out attack. They're filling in the paddies? Without them, we can't hold them all off. If it's come to this... ...let's charge now! Peasants, retreat to the Mochida Gate! Samurai, defend them with your lives. Now you say that?! Don't throw your lives away! Don't let your love for Nagachika make fools of you. Get going. Then why are you fighting, Lord Tanba? Me? Because I am a fool. Lord Tanba! It's him! He's alone! Prepare to fire! Take aim! No! Stay here! Hold! Hold! Hold! Hold! Hold! Both sides, hold! Hold! There is no need to fight! Odawara Castle surrendered yesterday! Oshi Castle is to be opened forthwith! The lord's castle fell before the vassal's? There's nothing we can do. It's over. All right, Nagachika? I don't like this. Even if they've opened the gate, our marshal shouldn't go in. I don't like it! I want to meet this marshal who withstood 20,000 men. They could kill us, you know. Bow down! I apologize for meeting you in this state. I am Narita Nagachika, Castellan of Oshi. I am Ishida Mitsunari, Marshal, Second Court Minister of Rites. 'Rites'? Give him credit for nerve! Our terms for the castle's surrender... All warriors, peasants, and townsfolk are to vacate the castle. Peasants will return to their homes. Warriors will vacate their domains. Warriors wishing to abandon samurai status are exempted. Agreed. Will that be all? Yes. No! Warriors will leave all personal property... ...including rice and weapons. What? No one sets conditions like that! The Regent so commands. He has established new conditions. Do you want all of us to starve to death?! What's this all about? We need to take back spoils of war. Could you two just keep quiet? Then you say something! I'm about to. Then hurry up! We only started because you were taking so long! Gentlemen, please! Milord has something to say, so please keep quiet. So what are you going to say? That we keep fighting? There. That's it. Lord Ishida! I have agreed to surrender, as the Lord of the Castle ordered... ...but if we are forbidden to remove possessions and food... ...the soldiers and others here will face starvation. We will in that case remain in the castle... ...and die in battle here. Our retainers, all great warriors, are fortunately in perfect health. If you have not yet had enough... ...we are fully prepared... ...to stand against you! You got us into this. You get us out. Take what you will from the castle and domains. No, we have decided to fight. Take what you want, I said! Now, now... If you want what we have... ...come and take it. Lord Narita, please don't torment us. The Regent's instructions are only to open the castle. That is all we require. I see. Well, in that case, I have two conditions of my own. The loser sets conditions? Those sandbags you put down for your second attack... I'd like them removed. The peasants can't plant their fields. Agreed. And the second? Peasants who had surrendered were killed by some of your men. I want their heads. What?! That is unforgivable! No matter who it was, I will have their heads. Agreed. And... Oh, yes... There is one condition remaining. Lord Ujinaga's daughter, Princess Kai, is to be sent to the Regent. Agreed. That is all. Very well. Lord Narita... Did you receive that wound in battle? No, no! I'm terrible with weapons. Tanba won't let me into battle. I performed a Rice Dance to entertain the retainers... ...and I got shot! Lord Narita, your Rice Dance was part of a plan, wasn't it. Not at all! We will take our leave. Lord Ishida! How many of the Hojo castles remain? Didn't you know? This is the only castle that did not yield. The story of this castle, vexing to me as it is... ...will live on as testament... ...to the Warriors of the East. You have fought well! I'll go on ahead. Beaten! Beaten! Utterly! I'm just not a strategist. So you'll stick to finance? No. Whatever it may cost, I will gather the finest warriors in the land... ...and lead them in great battles! After Hideyoshi's death, Ishida fought Tokugawa Ieyasu. Defeated by that future Shogun at Sekigahara in 1600... ...he was beheaded in Kyoto by the river at Rokujo. He stood up to them over rice for the soldiers... ...but he wouldn't stand up for me! You love him, don't you. I hate him! Princess... ...you will lie in the Monkey's arms. Before that, at least lie in the arms of a man you love. I will. You're a fool, too! Princess Kai won Hideyoshi's favor, and lived then in Osaka Castle. Some say she escaped when the castle fell in 1615... ...but nothing else is known. Yukie! Yukie! You got dumped? That's the red spear. First Among Warriors! I finally won it from Tanba. Of Shibasaki of Izumi and Sakamaki Yukie... ...there is no further record. Reverend! Masaki, the boy general! Ah, you two... thank you for everything. It was nothing. Chiyo! Kazo? Kazo! Where have you been?! Miss? Who's that? My Pa. 'Bye. Chidori! Pa! What will you do? Give up samurai status. I'll build a temple here at the Sama Gate... ...and pray for those dead in battle. Competition, huh? That's right. Near the Sama Gate, Masaki founded Kogenji Temple... ...dedicated to those killed in battle. Narita Nagachika worked to find positions for his former retainers. Tokugawa Ieyasu favored him, and took many into his service. He lived near the Tokugawa domain of Owari, where died at 67. Oshi Castle changed hands many times while the Tokugawa shoguns ruled Japan. In the 19th century it was torn down and the marsh filled in. The only original structure left is a part... ...of what is still called 'Ishida's Dike'.
