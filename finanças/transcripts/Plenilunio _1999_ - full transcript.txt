PLENILUNE - What time did she disappear? - 7:00. She went to buy a card. That was the last time she was seen. Her groin is bruised, but I still can't tell if she was raped or not. The blood wasn't hers. The neck wound is too small. A pocketknife? Probably. But it's a very slight cut. It doesn't take much to frighten a child. This is the cause of death. She suffocated. He panties were stuffed into her throat. She passed out before she died, from lack of oxygen. I hope she didn't suffer. You can wait outside if you want. I'd rather stay. It's even unpleasant for me. And it's my job. I know it is. But I want to stay. You must have seen lots of corpses. Yes, I have. You were in the Basque Country. I've only been here a month. Have you ever seen anything like this? Keep them off me, Molina. Do you have any clues? It's still early. Is the killer from here? I won't say anything. Don't film me! Get that camera away! What an asshole! Is it true the mother's been hospitalized? Who told you that? Captain, please. Don't you have anything to tell us? Well, no, we don't. - People want to know... - They'll have to wait. We'll tell you when we have something. When? When we have something. "If someone causes a child that believes in me to fall, it would be better to tie a millstone to his neck and hurl him to the depths of the sea. If your eye leads you to sin, put it out. It would be better for you to enter eternal life with one eye than, with two eyes, to burn "in the fires of hell." Thanks be to God. I thought you'd never visit me. If you'd waited longer, you may not have found me. This isn't working so well anymore. You're soaking wet. You'll catch cold. Come in, we'll have breakfast. You were stationed up north, weren't you? 14 years in Bilbao. How's your wife doing? Those 14 years destroyed her. They called when she was alone, Threatening her or not saying anything. When she hung up, they'd call again. Every day. I know she's in a mental hospital. An old geezer like me doesn't have to go out to hear all the gossip. Know anything about the killer? Almost nothing, Father. There are no clues. This is a small city, who could hide it here? Something that horrible must be written all over his face. Look for his eyes, his crime will be there. Some eyes have no soul, Father. That's not true. We all have a soul. Even the foulest murderer was created by God in His image. Would you recognize him? Could you identify him in a line-up like you did with us when we'd been mischievous? Whoever did that must have it written on his face. Christ knew Judas had betrayed him as soon as he saw him. Christ had an unfair advantage. You say he was God. It was Christ's human part that caught Judas. Someone has a secret that consumes him. Eyes that have seen what no one has seen. Eyes that gaze ahead right now some place in the city. Miss Susana, the detective is here. Thank you, Marcos. That's all for today. You can go. She was like an open book. She was special. Why? - Is this an interrogation? - No, of course not. It's curiosity. I can't get her face out of my head. I've seen a lot of photos of her. It's hard to think of a child as dead. She sat at this desk day after day all this year. Now it's been empty for the past week. The other kids haven't seen anyone strange around? Have they said anything? They're scared. So are their parents, they don't let them go out alone. If they say something, however insignificant, please call me. All right. Detective... Fatima was like the kids from working-class families used to be. They helped at home, but still felt they were playing. At nine or ten they had a sense of responsibility that children today don't generally have. That's why she was special for me. When I open up a dead adult's thoracic cavity, I see the effects of age, disease, and vices. You accept that our body is fated to decadence and death. But when it's a child, you just can't accept it. No matter how many autopsies you do, you never get used to it. This is your copy. The judge authorized it. - Waiter? - Yes? Yes? Another brandy. - Do you want one? - No, thanks. All right. Just Coke, Manuel? Can I call you Manuel? No penetration. There's no semen, inside or outside. Wasn't the hymen broken? Yes. The bastard must have done it with - his fingers. - And the blood? His. The vaginal bleeding didn't stain her clothes, she was already naked. The blood from the stairs? The same. He must have cut himself. That scumbag knows we don't know anything about him. Yes, we do. We know he's probably impotent. We have his fingerprints, his DNA. We know that the fingers that tore her vagina are rough. That doesn't seem like much to you? It seems like nothing. Fatima Dom√≠nguez, whose murder has shocked the country, may have suffered sexual abuse. She suffocated two hours after her disappearance. Detective Manuel Cervera was involved in an incident with journalists in which a cameraman was pushed to the ground. Shit... What? You don't want to be famous? If you'd been threatened for years, you'd understand. Look. It's Susana. Susanita Grey. You should have met her when she first came here. Susana Grey... Anything new? That lady wants to see you. Hello. I understand you want to see me. I saw the girl that night. Come with me, please. You have several messages... Later. Well... I live outside of town, by the river. Every now and then I come into town to shop and to see my sister. That evening I left my sister's house at 8:10. I know because the bus goes by at 8:30. And in the street... - You know Murillo St.? - Yes. It's where Fatima lived. Really? See, I'm not lying. I did see her. I swear. She was with a young man, I thought he was her uncle or her brother. I don't why I thought that. He led here like this, with his arm on her shoulder. They went right by me. Why did you notice them? What got your attention? I noticed them because his hand was bloody, he was sucking it. I thought, if he's not careful, he'll stain the girl's clothes. I'm here whispering to you, just to you, so you know you're not alone. I'll be with you until five, all night with you. That's more than the name of the program, it's a declaration of intent. You won't find a more faithful companion. All night with you, to help you at this intimate time. Maybe you're working... Whore. You've got the voice of a whore. ...maybe you've been with friends, or maybe, who knows, you're with someone. This music is for making love... "For making love". How can she be such a whore? Always the same... Wherever you are, remember I'll be with you all night... The same thing every night! ...so you know you're not alone, someone's with you. "I'm here to keep you company". For them to fuck you. Shit... This place is never quiet. There they are, without their teeth, their mouths caving in. That smell of old people... Thank God! It's about time it rained. Remember when it rained and we wouldn't let you out into the yard? You had to spend all recess in the hallway. No, you don't want to remember. That happens when you don't have kids. People without kids lose their memories. You didn't have kids. I've had hundreds! All of you. Especially the ones I loved most. The orphans of those who lost the Civil War. I want to show you something. I had thought of writing the history of the school, from when we opened it in 1947. But it's too late now. I have your file. No, I'm not that interested. Don't bother. It's no bother. I want you to know who you were. You don't look like you remember too well. Remember what Don Quixote said? "I know who I am." Tremendous words! I know who you were, but it's so long ago you don't remember anymore, or you don't want to. Maybe you don't know who you are now. Of course I know who I am. The boy you knew no longer exists. Look, look who you were. Recognize yourself? "... since his mother is without means of support and is disabled, and his father is imprisoned..." Look at it more, you haven't seen anything. You were just like that when you arrived here. I put you all in a row and I thought, "This one's the weakest". That was you. My job was to make you a Christian. They told us you were sent here so we could tear out of you your parents' evil seed. Did you believe in that? Of course I did. I'd fought in the war on the winning side. Shooting. Then I became a priest, and later a leftist priest. And you, the son of a poor leftist, a son of the losing side... you became a cop. I had to make a living somehow. - Did you father ever find out? - I don't think so. It was bad enough for him that I wanted to be a lawyer and that I was apolitical. No one is apolitical. That's what he said. He thought like you do. How do you know what I think? That I betrayed my people. I was called a traitor, too. They said I read communist pamphlets at Mass. You and I have that in common. Imagine, Manuel. The girl's killer could also be in one those photos. - Hello. - Hello. Things are bad at home. The two boys are with my sister, and we're there all day. Her father is unemployed. I can't stop thinking about it. We don't talk, we just go off and cry, hiding from each other. For several days now someone calls at the time she disappeared, says "Fatima", and hangs up. That's horrible! My husband's going crazy. I say, "We should tell the detective". He says no, the police are useless. What can we do? I'll tell the detective. If you came, too, my husband may not mind him being there. I'll bring him. Another beer? No, thank you. It's very good. It's almost 7:00. He's about to call. He's going to the phone. Remember. Keep him at least a minute so we can trace the call. How are you going to record it? Don't ask questions. He knows his job. The phone company will record it. Let the phone ring a few times. Fatima. Talk to him. I'd say that was an awful experience, but then I think about what they're suffering... Yes. You coming along made it much easier than if I'd been alone. Thank you. Well... Shall we have a drink? Yes. Of course, yes. Where's a bar? Here? The bars around here are depressing. We need to cheer up. That's my car. Dinner's on me, if you want. Are you having dinner with someone? No, I don't have anyone here. I don't know anyone. Let's go, then. Detective... What's your name? Manuel. Manuel. Like my son. It's strange. I just reread that book the other day. One poem could almost be written by Fatima. The page is marked. There. Borrow it. I don't read a lot of poetry. No poetry, really. - I wouldn't appreciate it. - Nonsense. Take it. How can he keep calling them? Wasn't killing her enough? It may not be him. It's so cruel. How could you call knowing you're torturing them? He likes the phone. There's no risk and he enjoys the fear he provokes. Were you ever threatened? - What? - Well... Did they ever call you when you were in Bilbao? How did you know? This is a small city. Small cities are worse than villages. Everyone knows everything here. Like the music? Yes, I do. Especially now, at night, on the road... A lot. It's how I escape. When I'm sick of this town, I get in the car and drive, with the music loud. I imagine going far away. When the tape finishes, it's devastating. Look at the moon! It's waxing. Really? - I never know. - It's easy. A priest told me when I was a kid. "The moon is a liar", he said. "When it's coming, it looks like it's going. And vice-versa." That's beautiful. What I first liked about this place is the name. "The Island of Cuba". Going out again - tonight? - Yes, for a walk. It's your funeral! Let him go. He's young. Maybe he'll meet a nice girl. He should go to sleep early, so he won't be late for work. He's never late. Really... What time do you wake up? At four. I used to get up at 3:30. The early bird gets the worm, and this job requires dedication. People who study and... Quiet, they're talking about the murder. ...has caused public indignation. The case is still open. The police have not talked much about their attempts to arrest the killer of the child... May God rest her soul. Death is too good for him. They should cut off his balls and let him bleed, and then bury him in a swamp. I don't want to lie in a cemetery with him. I'm finished. But son, don't you want some meat? No, really, I'm not hungry. Goodnight. I can't eat, I'm going to puke. Just hearing you eat without teeth, it's disgusting. Useless old man, there's no fucking need for you in this world, go die. Do you want dessert, son? No, Mom, I'm fine. Why do you lock your door? You don't have to hide from us. This house is never fucking quiet. You can't be safe. You can't even watch a video or have a drink or jerk off. Always spying on you. Then they say mothers understand their sons. Right, mothers. They have no fucking idea. "You have a great cock! It's huge..." You read my mind. I love a bit of wine with dessert. You never drink? Never. Baudelaire says men who never drink hide a secret. Mine is I had to stop drinking. I'm sorry I said that. I can be imprudent. It's not my biggest secret. After all this wine, I could tell you all of mine. Go ahead. For example, no one had to tell me where you're from. They did tell me, but I already knew. - How? - Your clothes. No one here dresses like that. I saw you and thought: "Basque Country or Santander". You were right. Did you like it there? What a question! Yes, I did. I did like it, believe it or not. People tell me I brought the rain with me. Were you afraid? Every day I left home thinking I may not come back. You got used to that? Human beings can get used to anything. They get used to illnesses, to fear of death... Fatima's parents will get used to it. - Hello. - Good evening. - Going for a walk? - Yes. Goodbye. What prices! Those panties cost more than a kilo of hake. The fucking shop owners get rich with clean hands, without the stench of fish on them. Excuse me... Yes? - Any news? - About what? The little girl. Hey, this isn't a press conference. Get moving. Sorry I bothered you. I could give a fucking press conference, man. Christ... If I wanted to, I could. If I fucking felt like it, I'd call you and tell you everything. I'd say who I was, from across the street, like in the movies. Or I could call the slut from the radio and tell her. "This isn't a press conference." Well, fuck you. More wine? I'm getting drunk. You're not from here? - Want to know who I am? - Yes. All about me? Right. I'm glad you asked. I'm from Madrid, I'm a teacher, separated, and with a 14-year-old son. Worn-down physically. Yes. No. And mentally, from work. And I'm so close to 40 that I might as well say I'm 40. Why are you here? I came... fifteen years ago. Fifteen. My husband was from here and he wanted to go back to his roots. I did anything he wanted. He wanted to break bourgeois conventions. Back then... We left Madrid, and we came here as newlyweds, feeling like pioneers. I got pregnant and we made friends with Ferreras and his girlfriend. The medical examiner? Yes. He wasn't one yet. He was a pot-smoking radical student. Who knew he'd get so serious? Anyway, his girlfriend, a very prudent girl... Unlike you. Unlike me... She turned into practically my only friend here. She baby-sat my son when I went out. That friend and my husband... Yes? Ran off together, leaving us here. And you stayed? Yes. I've been very alone. I'm not a solitary person, I just haven't had anyone to talk to. "My life could have bloomed, had not a cruel wind dried my petals in this part of me that you villagers see." "My voice protests from the dust." You never saw my face in flower! You, the living, are fools that do not know the winds, the invisible forces "that govern our lives." SAN LUIS HOSPITAL COMPLEX Are you well? Yes, like always. Did they give you your shot today? Yes. They came at six. It was still dark out, but I'm always awake then. Later, during the day, I sleep pretty well. Did it hurt a lot? Yes. But I went right to bed and forgot about it. The thing is, I heard the nurse say a name, but I didn't realize it was mine. I don't know... Have your mother and sister come to visit? Carmen, have they come to visit? No, I don't think so. Wait. Yes, yesterday. Or the day before. I can't remember. What an idiot I am! I brought you flowers. White roses, your favorite. Yes, I used to like white flowers. Yes... Shall I stay for lunch? No. Well, I'll call you tonight. Or you call me if you need anything. Thank you. What a surprise! How are you? You were waiting for me? No, no, I wasn't. I was just looking at... That's silly, isn't it? I'm very happy to see you. Would you like a coffee? Have you always worked this hard? Yes, I've always done my duty. No, I'm talking about something else. I have the feeling this has become personal for you. I hadn't thought about it. You like children? Well... I guess I'm like a lot of men, since I'm not around kids, I end up forgetting they exist. You didn't want kids? Yes, we did. At first, my wife really wanted to, and so did I. I thought I did. But the truth is, when we found out she couldn't, I felt a kind of secret relief. Do you think it's strange not to want children? Not to want them with the woman you love? Yes. This investigation has made me notice them. You've influenced that, too. Is that good? It's good to know there are other ages and other lives than one's own. Men notice things even less than women do. You always seem to be remembering other things. Yes. If for years you've wanted a different life, I guess you end up somehow distant. This investigation keeps my feet on the ground. That girl was buried a month ago but, I don't know why, I can't forget her. People don't talk about her, evidence is disappearing, and witnesses, but I... I'd have thought murderers plan everything and then make mistakes. In the movies. It's pretty easy to kill someone, anyone can do it. What disgusts me most about movies is how they make crime attractive, when really it's blundering cruelty. Well, then... Until we meet again. I owe you dinner. Will you call me? No, you decide when and call me. Ever feel alone? When you get home, do you ever want to go see someone? You never need that? Of course I do. You haven't wanted to see me? Shall I come up? No. I never know whether you really want to be with me, or if you do it out of courtesy. So, no, I don't want you to come up. Listen, tomorrow afternoon, after school, I'll get a room at "The Island of Cuba". I'll wait there. If you don't want to go, tell me now. You don't have to wait for me, I'll go with you. No. I want to go alone. I want to wait for you, I feel like it. How much? Hey! Excuse me. Sluts! My mom must want to change the channel and my dad must have a hard-on. How much? - What was it? - A whiskey. 500 pesetas. Eight o'clock. Fuck, it's eight o'clock. It's all the same. The same hour, the same shot of whiskey in my gut... The knife in my pocket... - Hello. - Hi. Going up? Yes. - Which floor? - The last one. It's late, isn't it? I couldn't leave work. Being here is like a dream. Not so fast, not so fast. Wait. Let me get undressed. Kneel down. Come on! Take it out! I can't wait! Take it out! I'm going to explode. Scream and I'll kill you. Come on! It won't fit in your mouth. You're all born whores, you know what to do. Come on! Come on! Fuck! I told you to fucking hurry. Just like the last time. Get up. Get up. Get up, I said! Don't move. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What for? I came too fast, like I was a teenager. So what? It was like being 18 again, just like my first time, the same haste, the same desire. Yes, but I'm not 18 anymore. Neither am I. It took me 20 years to feel like that again. Don't try to console me. Don't be silly. Why should I console you? I should thank you. Look at them and I'll cut out your eyes. Maybe you pissed yourself, too. It's the same. Fucking stop it. Don't move. It's like making love for the first time. It's all right. She's freezing. We have to take her to the hospital. It's all right. That's all, honey. Put down your legs. That's it... It's all over. Her hymen is broken, but with no penetration nor semen. What did they do to her? Who could do that? I'll give her something so she'll sleep. It's what she needs. You can stay with her. You're better than any nurse. Thank you. You'll sleep now, honey, without bad dreams. Tomorrow she'll take a blood test. I don't know how to thank you. Forgive me, I'm very... It's all right. How's your wife? She died a few months ago. It was very hard on the girl. I'm sorry. Listen, we can't imagine the terror she suffered, but she's only 12 and she'll get over it. She'll be able to forget it. You must help her. Courage. Take her to her room. Her father stays with her. - Was it him? - I'd swear it was. Where? By the river. The same time. But she's alive. He may not know that. What? He may believe she's dead. - What are you thinking? - We should be silent. Nothing in the press, no one should know. That will throw him off. I'll get permission for it. Let's go. Her panties. He stuffed them in her mouth, too. But she was lucky. The station called me. - The couldn't find you. - Right. I had dinner - with a friend. - Susana Grey? Yes, how did you know? I guessed. Someone said they'd seen you together. - Forgive the indiscretion. - Don't worry. You're friends. Yes, but I don't see her much. Well, we can go now. We didn't need the flashlights. There was a full moon when Fatima was killed, too. Could that be a factor? Being in the country with her uncle has helped. But still, every now and then, she gets quiet and cries her eyes out. Hello. Hello. Tell me about him, Paula. You told me before, but try to remember more. Only you can help us find him, you're very important in this. You know how much you can help? You remember his hands? Yes... His fingernails were dirty, black, like an animal's. His hands were very big. And he had a digital watch, I just remembered. And his face? His face was very long, his hair was black, and his eyebrows... His eyebrows were big and they met above his nose. His eyes... I don't know why, I can't remember his eyes. He looked at me like he hated me, but I can't remember his eyes. Then his mouth, those teeth... How did he talk? I didn't understand him. He told me to do things, and I didn't know what he meant. He insulted me. He kept saying the "F" word. He told me... to take off my clothes. But I didn't, because I couldn't move. He slapped me and knocked me down twice. The first time, I got up again. His accent? He didn't have an accent, he talked like people from here. He always had a cigarette. "Fortuna" cigarettes. Did I say the brand? I just remembered. I saw the pack and his lighter. He sucked hard at his cigarette and almost burned me once. Where? In your face? Here. And he put the knife to my throat and said, "Want to get it cut?" I got undressed so he wouldn't hit me, and when I was on the ground... I can't remember. I really can't. That's all right. You have a fantastic memory. I wish everyone remembered like that. You must do well in school. Right? It depends on the subject. Grammar is hard. Compound sentences and things like that. Every day, the same faces, shouting what they want. You have to smile and talk to them. "Yes, ma'am, they should execute him". Their mouths hanging open... Those mouths must stink as bad as the fish. - There you go, ma'am. - Okay. - How much is it? - 1,100. - When will you have bass? - Bass? On Friday, ma'am. Okay. Goodbye. A week, another, and nothing. Fuck! It's driving me crazy. They want to trick me, to make me feel safe. They're all quiet. It's a trap. They think I'm stupid. - Who is it? - An old friend. Hi! What a surprise! - Are you alone? - Yes, I'm alone. Are you decent? That depends. For you, I am. - Can I come up? - Of course. Enough questions. - Hello. - Hello. It's a crime for you to eat alone. No, I'm making some delicious fish. Well, you have your fish and I have this wine. Give me fish, I'll give you wine. It's a deal. Come in. Your fish was great. So is your wine. A toast... We can't really toast to old times. The old times don't deserve it. Our "ex es". Disgusting! In bed together. Crying because they cheated on us. And you and I were so faithful. We shouldn't have been. You believed in free love. In name only. I, the ardent anarchist, didn't get any. But those two puritan communists... That's true. I always had a secret. I liked you more than her. Once I visited when you were alone. The baby started to cry, you unbuttoned your shirt to feed him. I could only see a little, but it was intense for me and I felt embarrassed to be there. Did I really breastfeed him with you there? What a memory! Now I feel embarrassed. Susanita... You still want to go to Madrid? I applied for the transfer. That makes me sad. I never see you. That's true, life sucks. We've barely seen each other in 13 years. Well, we've been friends. Yes. But friendship can be painful. Especially if you want something more. You're surprising me. You never said anything. Are you in love? What questions you ask! - Yes? - Hello, I'm here. I'll be right down. - Hello. - Hello. - Have you noticed? - What? I came down by myself. That's great! Let's go. Okay. - Hi, Paula. - Hello. What do you think, fucker? That I don't see there's only one photo? Think I didn't notice? Where's the other one? You know, too. You think I don't notice, motherfucker? They're setting traps. They're hiding things. They think I'm stupid. They want me to slip up. It's because you're afraid. You're all plotting against me. You want to trap me. Maybe she's still there, decomposing... The smell of the river covers the stench, like anisette covering the stench of fish. She must be lying there like I left her. Fuck... My knife... Freeze! You move, I'll kill you! I've been looking for those eyes and there they are. The last eyes Fatima saw, the eyes Paula can't remember. What commonplace eyes! I didn't do anything wrong! I was just going for a walk, I swear! I found it by the river. You can smoke. Thank you. Want one? Ever seen this child? No, I've never seen her. Okay... Yes, I have. I mean, on TV, like everybody else. Open the envelope and look inside. Can I smoke another? Open the envelope. I gave you an order. Look at them! Look what you did! Look at them, you bastard! Have the balls to see what you did! The moon made me do it. I get drunk on it and it makes me do strange things. My mother says it always affected me. I swear I didn't want to kill them. But they were screaming... Please, don't call my house. It will kill my mother. The station captain, please. I'll never be afraid. Do you recognize him, Paula? He can't see you. Paula, dear, make an effort. Paula... Whore... Paula, if you can't talk, give us the number. Just the number, Paula. We had to give her a tranquilizer. She had an asthma attack. But she told us. She told us the number. How many years will he get? I don't know. I promised her she'd never see him, but who knows? Ten years from now she could run into him. A toast, detective. Not to this. We have to celebrate. For Fatima's parents, for Paula, and for you. I want to toast to you. Manuel, my transfer's been approved. I've waited so long for this moment, but I wanted to tell you... If you ask me to stay, if you ask me only once, tomorrow I'll turn down the transfer. Carmen's about to leave the hospital. Ask me to stay, though you can't promise anything, though it's just to see you as a lover, though we have to sneak around. Ask me to stay. I don't know what to do. When you came to sleep with me, did you know? You won't ask me. Destroy the evidence before your wife comes. Being a policeman, you'll do it well. Hello, Father. Manuel. You want to confess? I want to talk. Better face to face, don't you think? It's not easy to talk with you face to face. It was hard to come see you before. It meant confronting what I've been all these years. - What have you been? - A drunk. And a coward. Yes, a coward that didn't have the heart to take his wife away from that nightmare. I don't believe in God, but I've surprised myself with my need for forgiveness. For being a drunk and a coward. But you stopped drinking. Yes, I stopped drinking, and I left that shit life I lived in Bilbao. Look, Father, I used to think I was brave. I took risks, I didn't mind dying... I didn't know the difference between being alive and dead. Now I do. I came to this city and I found that little girl's body. And that woman... Susana Grey, the teacher. Do you know her? Yes. Yes, I know her. She told me. She discovered what the child's death did to me inside. For the first time, Father, I was doing something that was worthwhile. That woman, Father... I thought I knew about women, but suddenly I felt like I was starting all over again. If I'd died without meeting Susana, I'd never have know what desire was, what it is to enjoy a woman's love. I never knew love could be like this, so sweet, so easy, so strong. I'm sorry to talk about adultery, but I don't regret having fallen in love. So the secret behind this great change is a woman. I should have imagined. Why? Behind all good works, there's always a reason stronger than goodness. What will you do when your wife gets out? I don't know. That's why I came. Should I stay with Carmen or the woman I love? You tell me, please. Me, my son? Who am I to judge anyone? What do I know about the labyrinths where men and women lose themselves? Hello? Yes? Hello? Who was it? I don't know. They hung up. Mom, I want to go with you. You don't have to. Yes, I know I don't. We're running out of tape. I'll buy some more. Hello. You could have called. Come in. - When are you leaving? - Tomorrow. This is my son. Manuel, Manuel. I'll go downstairs. For string. Come on. I can't believe your son is so big. I don't have anything. I don't have any Coke, not even a glass. How's your wife? Better. But I didn't come here to talk about her. Why did you come here? To ask you to stay. Why did you take so long? I have three months off. I'm sick of this city. I can't spend my life drinking Nescafe in the teacher's room. I love you, but I can't wait for you to decide. Give me some time. Time for what? Tell your wife you can't sleep with her if you're thinking about me. You're saying we're separating forever? No. I can't say that to you because I'm really in love. I'm saying that I'm going, get your life in order and then come to see me. I'll do that. I hope so. I'll do it, I swear. Manuel! Manuel! I'm not dead. I'm not dead. You're his first visitor. - His parents haven't come? - No. They haven't even called. It doesn't affect him. But he did want to see you. He says it's important. - Does his lawyer know? - He doesn't have one. The one he had left the case last week. They'll get him another. Thank you. Thanks for coming. I prayed you'd come, I wanted to tell you first. After all, my salvation started with you. Remember what I told you that night? You didn't believe me. Not even your tears. You were right. I told you I killed them to stop them screaming. You knew that was a lie. The psychiatrists say I knew what I was doing. But I don't care, I have no reason to lie anymore. Because I didn't kill her. My hands did, but I didn't. Satan took over my will. Now I can remember what my hands did without suffering, I can look at them without shame. My spirit is in peace, the Angel of the Lord has brought me the mercy of sleep. The Bible's for you. How old are you? 22. And you? You'll be out in your thirties. And you'll do it again. Unless your God wants someone to kill you first. I only have to answer to the law of God!
