KISSES God only created woman to tame man SUMMER KISS Diane, don't forget the bread in the trunk! SUMMER KISS Yes! Who took my big bag? - I took your things. - What did you say, darling? - I said I took your big bag. - Great. Hang on to it! We're leaving in 10 minutes. Too bad for Sofia and Jacques. Here they come. Paul, my dear, you always speak too soon. Oh, my dears... we're just out of bed. Take this. Doudou was stung by a giant spider. His head swelled up for 2 hours. We were so afraid. Good heavens! In his place, I brought Eric, his little brother. He's just got his Bac. He's a smart cookie. - And he's a charmer. - Hi. - Grab that. - Quick, we're just waiting for you. - Have you forgotten anything? Cigarettes, bread, water? - We thought of everything. - Grab the end, there. Toss it. Hurry up, Eugene. Not all on the same side, eh. Eric Bichot. What a face! It's going to be fun. Have you met? Take whatever fishing line you want. No one takes care of anyone, here. Now I'm going to make myself beautiful. - That's a lovely top. - Dirt-cheap, my dear. -Very pretty. Gently bring your fish in without tangling anything. Away you go. Get your France-Soir, Le Monde, Le Figaro Literaire... That kid's cute. He wants to be a priest. - Really? - Yes. Can't be true! Hear that? The kid wants to be a priest. No kidding?! Would you mind? I'll kiss him before tonight. I'll bet you this necklace. What was that? -She was telling me about her necklace. It won't work. He never thought of it. If Diane tries, she'll see. Here... If you lose, it's mine. And I'll give you my bracelet instead. All right. Your coral necklace? You must be nuts. It's already lost. And for a simple kiss? What is it, my pet? You're laughing... - What is it? - Nothing. No... really. Sofia's trying to make us believe that Eric wants to be a priest. What's so funny? It's terrible. When you're that good-looking, you don't become a priest or a monk. You make children in your image. Ah, the sails... yeah! Girls, out of the way. Eric! Come help me hoist the jib. Diane, pick up your necklace. Put it around your neck, before you lose it. Want a hand? No, we're right, thanks. -Small, let the sail slide. I'm taking care of it. Watch out... we're changing tack. Can you fasten this for me? - My hands are wet. - No matter. Thanks. Thanks a million. Oh! Thank you! Oh, sorry. He's got charm, that kid. Do you think so, too? In 10 years we'll be lucky. No way... We won't get a chance. Oh, that's right... What a shame. Calm down. Move over, girls. Watch out, we're going to turn. Diane? What are you doing? If you stay stuck in there, you're going to be sick. What's she doing? Gotcha! I caught one. I caught one! Paul! Your wife's sick. You'll have to turn back. I knew this would happen! Are you really sick, my pet? Just leave me on a rock. - We'll drop her off. - Yes, at Les Evins. We'll pick her up tonight. - It's on the way. - We'll drop you off at Les Evins. Yes, anywhere will do... It's always the same. Don't you want me to stay with you? No just leave me... Please. Don't spoil your day because of me. I'm sorry. Alright then... Keep yourself covered, OK? You really don't want me to stay with you? What's up with her? What's wrong? - I'll go. - Leave her, Paul. It's obvious your wife wants to be alone. See you tonight... not before 6 o'clock! Eric, look... She looks really sick. Leaving her alone all day isn't right. You could give up your day, couldn't you? Why me? Because you're the youngest. Go on... Do me the favour. Go on... off you go. Eric, go on! Alright. Diane! Diane! Diane? - You're feeling better? - As you see. I'm really confused... confused about this morning. You shouldn't have had to give up your day. Oh, you know... It's really lovely of you. I saw that you liked fishing. Not really. The sea, fishing, sailing... I hate all that. But my husband's mad about it, so... I just like the sun, the sand... ...and to quietly relax, like this. - What about you? - What? I like best to be on the sand, in the sun. - What about you? - Oh, me... I'm just happy to be with you. Really? How warm it is...! You've nothing on your back? The sun's beating down... it burns. I'm used to it. Your head's burning. I've got something for you. It'll suit you nicely. Trust me. Oh no, please... no radio! What now? A cream that filters the rays. If your mother was here... - I don't want your muck. - You're just a kid. This cream isn't muck. It's lemon-based. We could eat it, couldn't we? There we are... Turn around. Your eyes can't be seen. - What's this necklace made of? - Coral. - Fished up in the South Seas? - Maybe. It's pretty. Hey! Would you kindly pull us in? -Please. Eric, don't! They're a nuisance. Thank you very much, sir. Very kind of you. Thank you so much. You are very kind. Eric! - I hope you weren't disturbed. - No not at all. - Is the bistro open? - I don't know. I just arrived. I have sandwiches. Thanks. Good day. Yoo-hoo! Eric, come on! Let's get away from those busybodies. There's a quiet corner behind the big rock. Okay. -Eric, not so fast. Let's move over there. If it bothers you, don't look. Swimsuit marks on your back are horrible. I hate it... my husband does too. Watch out for sunburn. Eric, be a darling... Take the tube and put a few drops on my back. What's wrong? Did you see my hedgehog? - Your hedgehog? - There. It's a hedgehog. - I'd call it a mole. - I call it a hedgehog. I was born at the beginning of the war, during the bombings. At each alert... ...my parents walked through a park to get to the shelter. One night they saw a hedgehog on the pathway. My mother was terrified at the thought of walking on it. She thought about it more than bombs. She had a hedgehog obsession. When I was born, the doctor said that spot was a stain of fear. So since then, my mother always called it "my hedgehog". I wanted to kiss it. It's the first time. For me too, Eric... Yes, since my marriage. Eric, do you know my husband? I love him a lot. And also my twins... They're two years old. Will you come and see them tomorrow? If you want. Why am I telling you all this? I'm stupid. A huge skinny one. We'll be fine here. Damn, there are lovers. Too bad. - Go ask them for a light. - Go yourself. Oh no. You go. I'll take care of the fire. Excuse us. Would you have any matches? - Here. - Thanks. - Why, it's Bob. - Diane, what are you doing here? - And you? - We've been fishing since dawn. - A friend, Eric. - Hi. Hi. - I'd like you to meet my my wife. - You're married? I got serious. Me too. I have two children and a big house. Madam. Oh, it's beautiful! But it's huge! Are you going to cook it? Yes, on the rocks. - Shall we eat it together? - Of course. -You really want to help me? Oh, it's very difficult. Oh dear. Hey, there's more. I feel as though I'm skinning a rabbit. Don't stop. I can't do it, it's too hard. Oh dear... Oh dear. - Where are you going? - Where I want. - It's very cold. - That's what I need. Eric, don't be silly! Eric! Eric! Have you seen a young man in blue swimming trunks? - By the cabin-bar, up there. - Thank you Madam. Eric! Don't be silly. Come on! You wouldn't have seen a brown-haired, tanned young man... ...in blue trunks? I see all colours in swimming trunks walk by. Thanks anyway. Miss...? I’d like a pancake and a cider. Where have you been? I've been looking for you for 3 hours. Sit down. One more. Not so fast, buster! The tide's rising. They'll be coming soon. - They won't be long. The wind's changed. You can hear the Pouliguen trains and carousel music. - It'll rain tomorrow. - It rains all the time in Brittany. They say the atomic bombs mess everything up. You believe that? -Possible. Paul knows all that stuff. Ask him. - Who's Paul? - Come on, Eric. My husband! How are you feeling, Diane? You look better. - Were you satisfied with your chaperone? - Satisfied? Amazing, my dear. Tell us about your day. Did you kiss him, yes or no? - Yes and no. - Oh. If it's because of your necklace, I don't care. Tell us the truth. To tell the truth, nothing. Nothing happened. Eric is charming, well mannered... That's all. You're freezing. What aren't getting dressed? Go on! Your things are in the cabin. Hurry up, we're coming. I'm coming to get my things. If I'm in your way, I'll leave. No. It's okay. Come on, girls... hurry up and get off. - Diane and Eric are in the cabin. - Paul will notice. Eric and Diane are below. - What's Diane doing? - I don't know. I do all the work. It's up to you. Oh, I'm going mad. I'll see. Diane! She's looking for something in the cabin. - Her necklace. - I don't think so. I won't pay for another one. Diane, Paul's calling for you. Quick, come on! Diane, hurry up! - So, darling? - Nothing. I assure you, nothing. Oh? I thought. Only believe what you see. - So, Diane? - So this is it. - Oh no. - I lost. Aren't you happy? In life, you have to know lose with a smile. Here. -Where have you been? Come on, hop in. Quick, darling.... home. Tell me who you kiss, I’ll tell you who you hate. JUDAS KISS -Hello? Sylvie Mallet? If you think you're alone in the life of Mr Robert Montagne... ...come to his house tomorrow at 10 o'clock. Tomorrow morning at 10. Open the door, Robert. It's Sylvie. - Am I disturbing you? - No, of course not. I was about to go out. There were cops at Raoul's, yesterday. I know. Still no leads in jewellery robbery Police make no progress but Commissioner hopeful Without my particulars they can't get anywhere. You were supposed to call me yesterday. No way they'll find me here. Italy will expect us soon... Rome, Naples, Florence... See Naples and live again. Are we really going? When? Next week? Tuesday or Wednesday... When I'm finished doing what I have to do. And I'm taking you. Right now, you have to excuse me. You should have called... You almost missed me. I was just passing by. I have to be at Le Reve tonight. Meet me there. - What time? - 11 o'clock. Okay. Don't be late. We'll have a good time in Italy. Alitalia flight 321. Two tickets for Rome. Departure: tomorrow Saturday, 10.15 a.m. 614 francs. Thank you Miss. -Hello? May I please speak to Inspector Bercy? If I understood correctly, you want introduce me to someone... ...who you think could interest us. For that matter, everyone interests us. You, for example. Why are you doing this? Not for money... and that's a pity. Because love stories... You'll have to go all the way with this. To be involved in a little game like this carries risks. You have an appointment at Le Reve dance-hall at 11 o'clock. In order to point him out to me... ...it won't be enough for you to dance or talk to him. You'll kiss him. That way it'll be more definite for us. No objection? - You dance well. - Miss, I... Excuse me, Sir... you're wanted at the bar. - Me? - Yes, Sir. Caught in the act, to be sure. How you learned that she wanted to betray you... ...that, I don't know. "Wanted to", because, actually, she didn't betray you. She even tried to save you. Take him away. Lambert...! This is the man she identified for us, in your place, at the dance hall. But she was unlucky. A cop! She kissed a cop, would you believe? It seemed suspicious. So we followed her... ...and here we are. See to her, Lambert. - But not like before. - Sure, Boss. Robert! Leave me alone, you liar. Robert, I didn't lie to you. But she really betrayed you! Because of who? Isn't he satisfied with his information service? She gave him... No! She loaned him a kiss. EVENING KISS I would've taken her to Japan. You're not serious. I know him... He always tells women the same thing. We arrive above ground, we go around... All the tracks were frozen... If I make up my mind, you call me. -You see what I was saying. Provided that Thelma won't be too late. She's always late. - The lamb will be overcooked. - What do you want me to do? No... it'll be fine, I assure you. Don't worry. ...a pan souffle like I've never had before. With ice-cream? No ice-cream but it didn't matter. It's fine that way. A pan souffle? Marvellous! Did you leave late the other night? 4am. Did you win? 70 or 80 francs, yes. You're lucky with poker. I play well. Hey, Thelma's invited? She looks cute. I know what you're thinking... Always the same... player, skirt-chaser... Look who's talking! We'll never change. - So, is she okay? - Yeah, she's good. - Didn't it work out? - No... ...and I went to a lot of trouble. She's untouchable. - "untouchable"? - Yes. - An untouchable girl? - Try her, you'll see. - I shall. - You've got no chance. What do you bet? 10,000 that you don't kiss her tonight. Kiss her, kiss her... You see? You're backing out. - Do I have to kiss her? - Yes. Good evening. You're on! - Good evening. - Good evening. - Jacques Berger, - Thelma Lariclez. - Good evening. - Good evening. Are you a foreigner? -Yes I am... No, don't tell me. I'll guess. - You're... - I'm Brazilian. But born in Hong Kong, and I live in Finland. You wouldn't have guessed, would you? Well, at first glance, no. Good. I'm late. Have I kept you? -No not at all. We're going to eat shortly. - Good evening, Thelma. - Good evening, Andre. My friend... You're lovely. GOOD? Are you crazy? - She's terrific. - Do you bet or not? I'll double it. 20,000. 20,000?! - My poor Jacques. - My poor Peter. Dinner, Ma'am. Thanks. So, are you coming? Coming? - You no longer have your Spanish girl? - She's an Italian. - She's Italian. - It's always very good at your place. Good... Francoise... to Andre's right. Thelma here. Elisabeth, you sit there. Michael, Jacques... Ah good? Jacques... And Pierre here. We have the same friends, and we've never met. Yes. Have you been in Paris for long? Yes. 18 months. A year and a half? What do you do? -Oh, I work at the embassy. - Then you must know... So, Michael... this trip to Japan? Much more interesting than I thought. - Did you stay long? - Three weeks. I went everywhere. It was exhausting... ...but I've seen it all. - In 3 weeks? - And the geishas? - I saw some, of course. I bought some fun things. But my main purchase was a robot vacuum cleaner. - "Robot"? - Yes, "robot". Imagine a plastic box with an engine and a miniature radar. You turn it on, and the vacuum cleaner travels alone around the apartment. Thanks to its radar, it avoids obstacles... ...and when it's full... It blow a whistle. The Japanese are mechanical geniuses. I'd like one. You should have brought your robot. It's not working, and no one can fix it. Engineers from the lpiko factory were listening to me. A top-notch brains trust. Outstanding technicians. I had to repeat the same thing 10 times... ...make gestures, to insist, to persist... The poor Japanese interpreter was unable to understand me. Please, Francoise. Your husband has a prodigious memory. He's extraordinary. Nothing Japanese is foreign to us. You haven't been able to say a word to Thelma. If I were you, I'd give up. -No way. As well... I really like her. Also... I don't know, but... ...she intrigues me. - Do you want a cup of coffee? - Yes please. Looks like an Edgar Poe character who'd vacation in Capri. Yes, maybe. - I'm going. - Where? Close to her. Let go of me. Thelma... Show me your hand. Would you? Please, Jacques, a bit later. Alright... If you insist. It has sugar... Is that OK for you? No, I don't take sugar, but it'll be OK.. We're out of luck. Jacques, what are you doing there? Well, my poor old man. - Excellent. - These cigars are mild. - Coffee? - I never drink it at night. Coffee? Do you want some coffee? - Yes. Thank you darling. - No thanks. For a long time I've believed that coffee keeps me awake. Listen, please... Pay a little attention. It's a very difficult trick... ...almost unachievable. Like Mandrake. You have to be very careful. That's essential. First I shuffle the cards. Watch my hands, please. Watch my hands. We're watching, my friend. The cards being shuffled... I forgot the rest. -Ridiculous. He's wonderful. Amazing. I had an important meeting with our agent in Zurich. Peter knows him. On the way, there was this crazy crowd... We should call him. Yes of course. -...in 3rd place. It was madness. I'd like to have a quick word with Jacques. Sure. The blonde's giving Thelma her life story. It's getting late... If you want to win, hurry up. Your bet? I don't care... It's her, who interests me. You absolutely have to separate them. How about dancing? You'll see. The taxis are very reckless. Once, in Kobe... Say, Andre... What if we dance...? My record player is broken. Like the Japanese vacuum cleaner, by Michel, by the way. -Very funny. Nothing works. So I was in a cab... So you see, it's complicated. - You look happy. - I finally got to sit here. It's an uphill battle to sit next to you. 30 years I've been waiting for this. You were next to me, at the table, the whole time. We couldn't say a word, because of the Japanese. And then Elisabeth wouldn't leave you. She had things to tell me. She's really unhappy. Poor Elisabeth. Me too. I've got a lot of things to tell you. You speak French very well. So you were born in Hong Kong? -Yes. Were you raised there? -No. I was brought up in Finland. Is it true that in Finland... ...they roll naked in the snow after their steam bath? Those who like doing it, do, yes. Do you like doing it? No. Come and see my fabric. Oh yes. Denise found a nice fabric. Excuse me. I'll go with them. See you. Honey, let's not stay too long. I'm going to Poitiers tomorrow. I won't be long. Yes, I go to Poitiers every Thursday. It allows me to read on the train. I'll tell you what happened to me in Kyoto. Jacques, this will amuse you. So... One evening, in a bathhouse... ...the masseuse arrives. She was small, 17, 18 years old... ...cute, brunette, slim... ...slanty-eyed... And besides, she was playing a Hawaiian guitar. Andre, could I borrow that book? My pleasure. We have to go. - Don't leave yet. - He must. - You're here? - Yes. - No. It's over there, old man. - Oh yes, over there. -Michel wants to borrow the latest Simenon. - And you'll lend it to him? - Well, of course. Oh, that child... It's like that every night. Denise has to get up. Have another drink? Thanks, but I'm going to leave as soon as Denise returns. - Oh, already? - Yes, it's late. Can you lend me a book, too? A detective story. I read one recently which was good. But I don't know where I put it. Pierre will help you look for it. He's good at that. Really? Well, come on, old man. -Thelma... Listen, I have something to tell you. I bet 20,000 francs with Pierre... ...that I'd kiss you tonight, in front of him. You've seen the problem that I gave myself. I really couldn't approach you.... ...in an obvious way, just to kiss you. Kiss me for 20,000 francs? 200 New Francs? Yes... Kiss you. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Wait a minute. Good. Pierre... - What is it? - Come here. He's finally asleep. I found it. You'll like it. Show me.... I believe I've read it. Arrange with him, old boy. We'll settle this. It's very good. - Goodbye, old man. - Good night. Well, there it is. Your share. Half, as agreed. Is Pierre angry that we've won? Not at all. He is a good player, like me. Good night. That's it. Good night. Say, I'd like to know how you got there. I'll tell you later. But if you want... I bet you... No more! I don't bet anymore. Pity. I'd have bet you 40,000... 400 new Francs... ...that I spend next weekend with her. At 16, a kiss just happens, after... 16-YEAR-OLD KISS -So, do you understand? Your train leaves at 8.12. You arrive at La Baule at 3.14 pm. I'll pick you up at the station. Got it? Yes, Dad. Tell me. My train leaves Maine station at 8.12 a.m. I arrive at La Baule at 3.14 p.m, and you come to get me. And have fun preparing the house for a country dance. -Hello, Claude? They pull out in about an hour. Show up in around an hour and a quarter. All right. 'Bye. See you then. Don’t forget to get your glasses. - Why am I staying? - For your glasses. - So? - So don't forget them. Yes Dad. - Lissac's, it closes at 7. - Yes Mum. Radio Cabs? I want a taxi for 57 Boulevard de Strasbourg. This is Taibout 5758. You eat at your aunt's house and go get your glasses. - Yes Dad. - In 3 minutes? Thanks. Hurry up, the taxi's coming. It'll wait. Up on. Down off. Say again. it Up on, down off. Turn it off when you're leaving. Come and see the gas. - I know how. - Come and see anyway. - You turn it hard. Say it. - I turn it hard. - I'm ready. - Alright. - Do you have your keys? - Yes Dad. Show me. If you're not wearing your glasses, put them in the case, in your pocket. -It's obvious. In your pocket, your mother said. - Yes Dad. - Say it. When I'm not wearing them, I put them in the case, in my pocket. Tomorrow I'll get my glasses. If I'm not wearing them, in the case, in my pocket. Otherwise? I put the glasses on my nose. That's it. Don't have anyone home. The day after tomorrow, you take the train. Try not to miss it. Henri, already 3 francs on the meter. Can't be. - Lissac's close at 7. - Yes Mum. So? You have to wait for the slow dance, to make out. There are only bags. If they're not a bag, they have a boyfriend. It works for him. - Is she your sister? - No. - Is your demob far off? - 404 days. It's okay, it'll go fast. - Slow dancing's not hard. - I'd rather not. - She won't leave her girlfriend. - Bring them both back. Trust me... I’m the Minister of Supply. Her boyfriend goes back to barracks at 8 o'clock. I'll get a date tonight. The girls don't come for dates. How do you know? She was dancing 3 metres away. - What are you doing? - We'll hunt outside. It’s easy to tell... They get in the car or they don't. I ship the goods. Come on, bye. We'll meet at my place. Here's the merchandise. I swear... they stood me up. Girls... you've got to grab them right away. You? Having an apartment like this and not find girls... He's here tomorrow. For once, we have an apartment... Girls, you've got to grab them right away. They stood me up. - We don't have any luck. - No we have no luck. What do you expect to find in August? Put on a Billy Brook. Hey, you over there! Hey, girls! Don't move, we're coming down. Yes. Yes! OK, we're coming down. Wait! Don't let them get away! Up is off. Down is on. Count to 30 and go. - Why are you going first? - It was my discovery. - I warn you:... at 50, I turn on again. - All right. -1, 2, 3... I'll go and see you in Italy. Just a little one... ...31, 32, 33, 34... And then shit. ...11, 12, 13, 14, 15... I only dance slow. It's obvious she doesn't want to! -Sorry. Can't you go sing somewhere else? No, I'm at home. Come on... I need a strong man. "A strong man." Good. I'm not doing well, with the big one. Yeah, I scored with mine. -And the bag in glasses? - I can score with her too. - You're over the top! Have you seen her face when she looks at me? You can score with the big one, okay. But with chubby in glasses, no. What do you bet? A Billy Brook single, that in a quarter of an hour... ...you can't kiss her. I'll score! You'll see... I'll score! This is not giving the kiss of pleasure, it's leaving regret and giving desire. DEAR KISS One to Meaux return. 8.40. Thanks. Isn't there a train for Meaux at 9.15? Withdrawn until August 28. There's the 9.40 one. Thank S very much. A coffee please. - How much? - 45. [SWEDISH ACCENT] Are you Mr Bistel? - Pardon? - Mr Bistel? No, my name is Bell. Antoine Bell. Oh, excuse me. Can I help you? I have to find Mr Bistel at the station. This is his picture. I thought it was you. It could be anyone. So he's a stranger to you? Oh no. I've come to work in a family, as an au pair. Mr Bistel wrote that he'd meet me at the station. People are funny. They have a girl come a long way... ...and they're not even here to meet her. Silly, isn't it? No. I have the address and the phone number. It's above board. It wouldn't hurt to call him. I have a little free time... Like me to come with you? That would be nice. Oh no, allow me. Over there. Phone token, please. Thanks. Come on. What is the number? It's ringing, but no answer. There's probably no one there. Too bad. But thank you, Sir. -What are you going to do? Nothing. I'll wait a while. I'll call later. You have the address... you can go there. I'll put you in a taxi. The trouble is... I have no French money. I'll lend you some. That way we can meet again. No. I prefer to wait. Mr Bistel will come eventually. There are plenty of guys with caps, in railway stations. - Guys with what? - With caps. I mean... people you have to be careful of. Oh, that's not serious. Oh yes, it's very serious. I saw one pick up a kid. Where from? South America, Black Africa... Here, at the station? Yes, there, at the buffet... At the cafe. I've got to go. - Heck, I missed my train. - Sorry. -It does not matter. It doesn't matter, I'll take the next one. Good. Well, here we are. - I'm very sorry. - It really doesn't matter. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. - I'd like some ice cream. - All right. But then not here. You don't know Paris? Not at all. - What if we go to the Champs-Elysees? - Oh yes. Then Champs-Elysees it is. Champs-Elysees. - A cigarette? - No thanks. - Here, okay? - Sure. So this is it. - It's big. - Yes, it is. It's really big. It's even bigger than what I expected. Keep it. A cafe... - Is Christian Dior around here? - Not really. - I'd really like to see it. - Nothing to see. I'd still like to go. We're going up to the Pergola. The ice cream there is not bad. Shall we sit here? No, we'll sit over there. An ice cream. - Vanilla, strawberry, chocolate? - Vanilla-strawberry. - And Sir? - A beer. -French, German, Danish? French. No... a glass of cold milk. - Plain? - Yes. - Cigarette? - No thanks. You're going to have lots of free time. Yes a bit. You don't know anyone in Paris? No, no one. What are you going to do, then? It's easy to have fun here. And then I'll take French lessons. And you? Why you were going to take the train just now? No reason. Well, I mean... To visit my parents. I go there 3 or 4 times a year. So now, you're on vacation? Well, yes and no. I was working... but it got stopped for now. Thanks. Thanks. - You first. - No, please. What were you doing as a profession, before? - Me? - Yes. Well, I was a pastry chef. What? Many people love cakes. I made ice cream, too. I stopped because I'm allergic to flour. Yes, it gives me pimples. Now I don't know what I am going to do. And you? Me? You know everything. No, nothing at all. What do you do for a living? Nothing. No plans? No... really. What's funny? The thought of the cake-shop. Can't see the joke. I'm sorry, but really... You're not angry, are you? Here, I'll give you a wafer. Half, then. This is what we'll do. Me, I eat it over here... and you over there. And the one who eats the biggest piece... ...has the right to call the other an idiot. OK? Come on. Ready? Go. I'd better go and phone once again. Mr Bistel may have returned. You still have the token, don't you? Thanks. [Swedish] Yes it went well. I'm at the 'Pergola'... next to the 'George V' hotel. Give me 15 minutes. See you. So... I spoke with Mr Bistel. It was his weekend. That's why he wasn't at the station. I told him where I was. He's coming to get me. I believe it's better he doesn't find you with me. -Do you want me to leave? Yes, I think it's better. But we'll meet again. I should hope so. No, I promise. We say that, we say that, and then... Are you relaxed now? What a kid you are. - I'll call you tonight. - No. I'm going to people that I don't know. - I'll call you. - I don't have the phone. Give me your address. I'll write to you, and we'll see how to do it. Write it there. - But your trip? - It can wait. I'll tell them that I'll come later. - So you're going to write to me? - Of course. - I'll be waiting for your letter. - Yes. Take care of yourself, now. Quickly. But... I don't even know your name. Agatha. My name is Agatha. See you soon, Agatha. Waiter... Do you have an envelope? Certainly, Miss. Thanks. Shit. Karine. Would you mind mailing this letter for me? Thanks. I bumped into a southerner who had 700 new francs on him. That'll support us for a fortnight. That's chic! You? I picked up a dork who turned out to be flat broke. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
