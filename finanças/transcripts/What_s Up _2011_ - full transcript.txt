Episode 5 Subtitles by DramaFever I lost my way, If I stay here, I will suffocate. The hours that strip ahead of daybreak will never come back to me. The signs of my dream and this courage that's unfamiliar to me. My hot tears and my heavy footsteps, In the worn pages of my diary inside my memories, I find myself, whom I've been forgetting. 13, 14, 15... 16, 17, 18... 19, 20, 21, 22, and 2 lines. 22 and 2 lines. That makes 112 times. So I'm guessing this means you climbed those steps 112 times. Am I right? How many times do you have to climb those steps? 22 times 13. So how many times is that? 22 times 13...220...66 286? Hey, that's cheating! That's fine. My motto is, "Try your best at everything, because just trying is good enough." Why did you enroll in the musical theater department? If you came to college just to make your mom happy, No, it's not like that! You could've gone elsewhere and chosen a school that would prepare you for a well-paying job. Do you hate to answer my question? Or do you just not know how to answer it? Well...I've never seen a musical before. Mmm...okay. Go on. I thought musicals were the same thing as plays. So that's why I applied to the musical theater department. What do you mean? I saw someone singing on stage, and later I found out that she'd been rehearsing a musical. Someone told me that a musical is about singing on stage, in addition to talking. Mmm...okay, I like your explanation. It's very simple. I like it. Okay, go on. What else do you want me to explain? So when you heard that person singing, did an alarm bell go off in your head? I'm going to take a shower. Since I need to go to our gathering with the upperclassmen by 7. Otherwise, they might give us more trouble again. What you just told me is a bunch of nonsense! Whether you really wanted to study acting, or just heard an alarm bell go off in your head, it's the same kind of nonsense. Well, I'm sorry for ruining your morning with my load of nonsense! The people you can't trust in this world are the ones who are in this acting business. And when the spotlight turns off, people who were on stage suddenly become nothing. So-- So, I told you! My motto is, No matter what others say, if I start something, I will stick with it as long as I can! And if you find it difficult later on, will you simply give up knowing that you at least tried? You've never once in your life finished something that you've started, have you? Do you at least finish going to the bathroom every morning? I'm going to leave. You don't even care about winning this musical competition, do you? But, of course, you wouldn't know anything about facing a challenge and winning, would you? Since you've never done it before. I'm giving you this piece of advice for your mother's sake, But wake up! Your dreams need a reality check! Doing musical theater isn't like singing karaoke! Alarm bell...are you kidding me? Hey, you back there! You can stop eavesdropping now. We're done talking. This is great! Do you like it? - You like it too, right? - Yeah! It sounds totally different from the original! I think it's great too! So...who arranged this song? Huh? Ahh...my uncle did! Wow, your uncle's really cool! This kind of beat, rhythm-- It sounds very hip and contemporary! Even I don't know much about contemporary music. Well, the only person who doesn't know about contemporary music is you. So your uncle does music? Oh...uh...he knows someone who does music... Is the person a composer? Is he or she famous? Not exactly a composer, but... Let's see...what was his name again... What did uncle say his name was... Well, if I don't know his name, you probably don't either. Hey, have you guys seen this? It just came out. Careful, it's expensive! Whose music is this? I like it! Is this our song? You! When I fall down, with your unwavering strength and steady gaze, you always pick me up. And you, when I'm barely hanging on, and standing on the ledge, full of sadness, You always come to hold my hand. I! There's nothing that I have done for you. I have nothing to give to you-- Entrance restricted. The monster of the musical theater department lives here. What the...ugh, who is it? You and I together, it must feel so right! I will never make you wait. No matter what you tell me, I will always be there for you! You should've told me earlier if you couldn't do it! Why are you telling me this in the middle of the semester?! - What should we do? - Later! She's going to kill us! Who recommended you, Professor Jang? I did!! Me, Yang Soo Jung! Okay, you're right, let's tell her later! What's this?! Uh... But Professor Jang, what does your going abroad for a concert have to do with me? Why does our school have to pay the price for your decision to go abroad for a concert? Hello? Hello? Hey!! How dare the jerk hang up on me while I'm talking?! What are you doing here? Isn't this Professor Sun's office? - I guess I came into the wrong office. - What? Have a nice day. Yes? Come in. Eun Chae Young, the director for Team A, told me to give you this. These are the script and music we'll be using for our musical face-off. Chae Young told me that since I haven't contributed to the team, I should at least help by running errands. Okay, you can just leave that on my desk and go. Starting today, I want you to teach voice classes to the first years, every Tuesday and Thursday for 3 hours at a time. Teach what? Voice classes. You used to be an actor in musicals. And your major was in voice. Now that I've informed you, I'll let the school's president know too. I can't sing. What do you mean? I haven't sung in a long while, so I don't think I can teach singing classes. To be precise, you haven't sung in 5 years, right? Exactly 5 years and 4 months, I believe? Okay, I think you've said enough. Oh, did I say something to offend you? Ah, you mean I should stop saying how a very popular musical actor stopped singing all of a sudden? Let's see, where should I start? From a psychological point of view, I'd say it was your sense of guilt. And from a religious point of view, it was a matter of your conscience. Voice classes...I'll teach them. You must teach for the full 3 hours. 45 seconds won't do. - Will I be paid? - Depending on how well you do. I have to take my pants off in order to wear this. Get what I mean? Then take them off. Okay, my turn! I did it! Great job! Next time try flipping this way too. Round of applause! Are you going to participate? I hurt my leg. So I'm just watching. Ahh, so you can't do flips. You refuse to do something that you're not good at in front of other people, huh? I said, I hurt my leg! Ugh, must be really tough being you! And you, if you really want to take classes with us, why don't you just apply to our school? (Haha, yeah right!) - Are you okay? - Yes. - Will you be okay? - Yes. - Where were you this morning? - It's a secret. - We need to talk. - Okay. By the way, I saw you practicing by yourself at night. Poor thing! - So why don't you tell me now? - What? Tell you what? Oh, you mean how I feel about you? A detective came to meet with my mother. You told me that you borrowed some money from loan sharks. But why did a detective come looking for my mother? Hey! Look at me right in the eye and tell me. What the heck have you guys done? Your friend Ha Goo messed up. Did someone get hurt? How badly? I don't know. We just ran away. The person was bleeding though. Bleeding...from the head. But why did a detective come to our house? Ha Goo's the one who did it, but why did they come looking for me? Udu and his boys. They've been after you for a while and are upset they haven't caught you yet. And? Well, I know one of his boys, and he told me that... Hey! Just tell me what I need to know. Udu snitched on you to the police. He told them both you and Ha Goo were responsible. The police are looking for us three in every street and alleyway! But I haven't been doing that sort of stuff on the streets for a while now! But only you and I know that. I'm really sorry! If you're really sorry, then let's go! Let's go to the police and tell them the truth! That Jang Jae Hun knows nothing about this! So that he should be left out of this! Let go of me! So what are we gonna do then?! That's why I'm saying we should run away together! Now I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't plan on living my entire life as a fugitive. And now, for once in my life, I want to do something right! I want to find something that I've always wanted to do, and do it well! I don't want to be held back by something you guys have done. And I'm not going to be held back! I don't want to waste my time talking to the police! And as for you guys--where the heck can you run away to anyway, huh? Yeon Ju! Hey!! Dammit! Excuse me, sir, but I'm looking for a student and would like to know where I can find him. What brings you here? We've come from the police station and would like you to cooperate with us. Do you know which department the student is in? I was told the musical theater department. Is there anyone from our college who can sing well and needs a job right now? Anyone is fine, as long as they can sing. Oh, excuse m-- Who? Jung Myung Hwan? He went to Germany. Is he back already? Ah, never mind. He's too popular. What? You're telling me I should ask someone else, not you? Argh! Just give me his number then! Professor! I have something to tell you. Hey, if you just tell me over the phone, do you think I'll memorize it? Text the number! I gotta go now. Someone's talking to me. For this upcoming musical competition, can we receive some help from people outside of class? Sure. Go ahead. Then you're fine with it? - You're the director, right? - Yes, the director for Team A. A musical director should be willing to do anything-- even sell her husband if need be-- to create the best musical she can. So do whatever you want. And remove those hideous shoulder pads! Thank you. - Ah, one more thing... - Hello? Is this Myung Hwan? A few reporters might be coming to our musical competition. Hi, it's me, Sun Woo Young. They're coming because of me, but they might want to interview you too. You used to be famous, remember? They might ask you some questions about the reason you quit acting. But that happened a long time ago, so you're okay with it, right? Eun Chae Young, listen. Oh my! You even remember my name! I thought I was only a B-rated actress. Why are reporters coming to our school? That's what I'm saying! But what can we do? It's not like they won't come if we tell them not to. Recording. Are you going to go up or not? Are you a professor here, by any chance? Before you ask me who I am, shouldn't you tell me first who you are? I'm Detective Cho, from Seo Dae Mun police station. I came here to investigate. How can we be of help to you? Argh, why do I keep seeing that ugly girl in my head? Hey, Jang Jae Hun! Yeah, yeah, first year, musical department. Jang Jae Hun, first year, musical department. Why you, do you want to die-- Whoa, whoa, hey now. Go to Professor Yang's office. She's looking for you. Now? I'm a little busy right now... "I'm a little busy right now." Huh! It's an emergency! That means now! Immediately! Urgent! So you should run over there right now. Got it? Jang Jae Hun! Professor Yang is looking for you. Her office is right here. Ah, there's Jang Jae Hun! - Don't eavesdrop! - Let go! You listen in too! Jae Hun, they are policemen who've come from Seoul. They said they have some questions to ask you, so-- Wait a second. I think I've seen you somewhere. Haven't we met before? I see that they're asking whether they have met you before. I said I'm not drunk. Hey! Udu! So! Is this where you've been hiding from me? Huh? I don't think so. I don't remember meeting you. Ah! You're the one who-- Hello! I'm Detective Jang from Gangsuh Police Station. From Gangsuh? What is a detective from Gangsuh doing out here? I chased this guy all the way here. Hey, you! Aren't you the one who impersonated a detective? Huh? Who, me? Well... So are you saying that this student was impersonating a detective? Is that why you came here? No, it's not that. Hey! You don't recognize me? I don't know anyone who works at the police station. I definitely remember your face. When was that... last year... So who are you? Let's see your ID. So, as I was saying, this guy's just a henchman. We're looking for another guy. What have these losers been up to! Look! Over there! Catch that guy! Argh, that bastard! Sir, you'll have to come with us to the station. Wait a minute! What did I do wrong? I don't know who you are, and I think there's some sort of misunderstanding-- First, around 11pm on the night of the 16th, the pickpocketing case in the alley. What is that detective talking about? Pickpocketing? What did Jae Hun do? The 16th...the 16th... Right! It was that day! That day?? - Hey, where did I put my cell phone? - Cell phone? Maybe you left it in the practice room? Wait! Jae Hun just got arrested! - Make sure they don't go anywhere! - What? Hey, Tae Yi! There's a witness who said he saw you there, Jang Jae Hun. So I have a lot of questions to ask you, starting with that case. So why don't you just cooperate with us, okay? Hey! Do you want me to put handcuffs on you? Won't all your friends see that? Do you really want them to see you in handcuffs? What are you doing? Hello! I'm Ha Do Sung, first-year student in the musical theater department. - And? - And? But-- Jang Jae Hun is our director! We have a musical competition next week, and we--no, I mean Jae Hun is our director, and we don't have much time, so he needs to go and start directing our musical and-- We need to prepare our musical! - Step aside. - My uncle arranged the theme song for us. You haven't heard it yet, have you? Wait! You have to listen to it. Wait! You can't go like this! You really have to listen to it! Sorry, Professor! Wait a minute! Please take a look at this! Jae Hun really didn't do anything bad on the night of the 16th. I keep an electronic diary. Please just wait a minute and look at this. Thursday the 16th. It's a bright, sunny day. I had bulgogi* for lunch today, but it wasn't good-- (*seasoned beef) Wait, this is not it. Today I told Jae Hun about my father and mother. I sang my father's song to Jae Hun on campus in the middle of the night. Jae Hun laughed when he heard my song. We even danced together. Like I used to do with my dad. When we dance, the whole world plays music for us-- Look at this, it says here "on campus in the middle of the night." So that means, that Jae Hun was with me-- Thursday! Jae Hun was with me throughout Thursday night. I'm his roommate, you see. I pulled an all- nighter that day because I had a lot of work. And Jae Hun was in our room the whole time. Byung Gun! Yeah? You came to our room that night! To borrow his toothpaste! You came to our room to borrow his toothpaste! Jae Hun's toothpaste! Ah! Yeah, you're right! That night. What time was that? Either 5 before 11, or 5 after 11. Between those two times. How do you remember that so precisely? I went right after watching a drama that airs on Thursdays. But why are these people here? You sure have a lot of friends. When did you ask all of them to create an alibi for you? I'm not sure what's going on, but are you looking for an alibi? If it's about Jae Hun's alibi for the night of the 16th, I've got one for him, too. Here. The date and time are all on there. 10:31pm on the 16th. I beat a computer game that night, so to celebrate I filmed some stuff at night. If you're talking about the night of the 16th, I remember that night, too. I remember seeing these kids enter their dorms between 10 and 11pm that night. Students always have to be back in their dorms by 11pm. If you need, I will show you the security journal. Jae Hun! Get out of the car. You know I'm not finished with you yet. The night you impersonated a detective and ran away... Let's continue our conversation about that later. So what just happened? Who are those people? What did we just do? - We did something great! - Hey Byung Hun! Huh? Bang bang! Bang bang! - Bang! - Bang! Ah, you shot me too many times! Oh, this is just juice. Clear juice. It's very sweet! Your school is really weird. All the professors and students are really weird. You know you have only yourself to blame for coming to a school like this. You chose a college at random, remember? But you're a pretty weird guy too, so I think you fit right in. You fit right into this weird school. You and your school are like two peas in a pod. Excuse me, do you know who Jang Jae Hun is? Jang Jae Hun? He's that guy right over there. You know what, Jae Hun? You and Ha Goo were always the ones who started something. But I was the one who always made that possible for you guys in the first place. So don't think you're ahead of me by getting a fresh start in life. Whether it's just a game or about real life, what matters is who finishes what they've started. I'm going to start a new life too. Whatever that may be! Something that makes my heart race. Something that's worth risking my life for. I'm sure there's something like that for me in this world. You see, I just wasn't sure how to get my life off to a fresh start. That's all. P.S. That girl Tae Yi doesn't like you. You're the one who's drooling over her. Ha, poor guy! What? Haven't you forgotten something? What? For example, thanking Tae Yi for what she did. Ah... Of course, you don't have to thank me. Oh. Okay. Hmph! We even sang and danced together. But I guess he doesn't care to thank me. - Where's Tae Yi? - How should I know? - Is she in her room? - No. Then where is she? In the practice room. You're the best! My dear loyal, porn-watching friend! I told you I don't watch porn! Porn?! I didn't watch any porn! Aww, is it really that hard? You've done 10 flips so far, and each time you've flipped over sideways! It's not like I want to flip sideways. Just think about it. You always flip over to the right side. So this time you should try shifting your body more to the left. Then you will land in the middle! - Really? - Yeah, try it! So you're saying I should try going left? That's right. Go more left. Then I should land in the middle, right? Okay, get ready! Go! Go! Don't laugh! Oh, I wasn't laughing! I was snickering! Ugh, seriously! Then why don't you try it, Dad? Come over here. You try it yourself. It's about rhythm. There you go again, with your "rhythm"! Everything in this world depends on rhythm. Just listen to the earth spinning on its axis. If you just follow that rhythm, everything else in this world will move along to the music, and-- You can fly in the sky and dance tango on the seas! Yes, of course! Okay, so keeping that in mind, try it again. Remember, it's all about the rhythm! Ready? Go! Jang Jae Hun! O-oh... Park Tae Yi. What are you doing here? Uh... Do Sung said... I should... Should what? Thank you for what you did for me earlier. So... Thank you. (Okay.) - The timing then-- - Are you going to keep practi-- You go ahead first. Oh...I just wanted to say that the timing then was great. Do Sung and I were coming out of Professor Yang's office, and Yeah, that's all. And you? Are you going to keep practicing? Well... I keep feeling like I can do it, but it's just not happening. So I'm getting pretty frustrated. Oh, really? Well, then... I'll be leaving now! Good luck! Could I take a look at that? Fire extinguisher. Storage closet. Professor Sun's secret. Should I keep his secret, or reveal it to the rest of the world? Of course, revealing a secret to all the world would be a lot more fun! To be continued! Cut! Ha Do Sung's uncle. He seems really musically talented. The music that he arranged for us...it's the bomb!! I wish I could listen to it. I'll download it early tomorrow morning and bring it to you. My nose tickles! Here? No, no, a little over to the side. Here? No, a little to the left, up. Yeah, a little down. How about now? Oh no, I'm gonna have to redo this area here. But isn't it hard to compare to the music Soo Bin made for us? Of course it's hard to compare. The two arrangements are completely different. Based on the music alone, it'd probably be hard for the professor to pick the better team. But the music isn't the only thing that matters when making a musical! Of course not... How's your team's director? Jang Jae Hun? Does he even know what a musical is? Ugh, please don't even go there. It's one of the 3 mysteries of our school. How someone like Jang Jae Hun could get into our school. I'm pretty sure that the professors who were judging him that day, got food poisoning and became so sick they accidentally gave him the wrong score. Are his parents rich? I wonder if they donated lots of money to the school. So that must mean you guys haven't prepared anything except the music. Nope. And Jae Hun would never do stuff like dancing. With a director like that, we can't rehearse our choreography or anything! Dancing? Yep, I want us to get our choreography down for our musical contest. I bought you pizza, but now you're saying I have to practice dancing with you guys too before you can show me your diary? - One more condition. - One more?! Do Sung sent me a text. He wants to know what it says in the paper airplane that you've been reading and giggling over. What's this stuff about a paper airplane? It seems like a love letter, so if you ask him to show it to you, he'll probably stop asking you to show him your diary. Fine! This is the last condition, right? Ooh...a love letter! Here. Wait just a second. I'm assuming that what you read earlier to those detectives isn't the end of your diary? Of course not! Promise me you'll read only what I wrote for that day. Don't read any of the other entries! - Wait! - What? Don't read the end where it says "P.S."! What? That's not fair! Hey, give that back then! What is this? Oh...that. Is this a love letter too? What's this? It's an address. Seongnam-si, Bundang-gu... Gui-dong, Building #45. Subtitles by DramaFever Alright, call it! - Just mouth the words. - But that's not enough! - Mouth the words in sync with the song. - And please don't spin in the opposite direction! Seriously, give me a break! I'm Eun Chae Young. I don't like doing things half-heartedly. I'd be disgracing myself if I were happy about winning against you pack of losers! I'm running! I'm running along the path I've chosen for myself! Art isn't about winning or losing. It's about creating something and having fun while doing it. Mom, I've been pretending to be your little doll for 20 years. Isn't that enough? Can't you let me go now? What do you want me to do?! What's your name? What were you doing when my father died in the accident? Jae Hun's lesson on the definition of a musical. Theater that involves singing and dancing. Isn't that what a musical is? So you mean it's theater, but you also have to sing and dance? Well, you're still performing in front of an audience, aren't you? Right? You know what a Korean masked dance is, right? Korean masked dance? You see it in Korean historical dramas. You know, where they wear masks and sing and dance. And they poke fun at society, and the audience is gathered around them watching and listening. And the audience claps for them and gives them money if they put on a great show. So a musical is a masked dance? You know pansori*, right? (pansori: a type of traditional Korean music) You know, where they stand like this and hold a fan in their hand. Ah, so that's what you're blabbering about! So, in other words, pansori is theater. It's like a play. And when you dance like this, and sing and say stuff too, now that's a musical.
