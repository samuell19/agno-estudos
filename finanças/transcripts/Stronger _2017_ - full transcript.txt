It's crazy right now. I will help you. DR. KALISH: Jeff underwent a double above-the-knee amputation. Most of the destruction had actually already been done by the bomb below the knees, and it was very obvious to all the surgeons involved that there was no way to salvage anything below the knee. We had to get higher than the knee to get clean skin, clean muscle, clean tissue.

MALE REPORTER: (ON TV) As they look through all these little pieces, Brian, they think the bomb now was made by putting the components inside a pressure cooker pot. And in there were nails, BBs and ball bearings to magnify the destructive and injury-causing nature of the blast. And the explosive was gunpowder.

FEMALE REPORTER: (ON TV) After the bomb blast at the Boston Marathon took most of his legs, 28-year-old Chelmsford resident Jeff Bauman is lucky to be alive, but his real struggle has just begun. Bauman told reporters that he will one day walk again. After multiple surgeries and endless painful rehabilitation, many people would give up. - WOMAN: Erin, come here! - But with the support - of his family and friends... - Jeff's on TV! - My Jeff? - Come here. ...supporters all over the world. Jeff Bauman has found something amazing here at Spaulding Hospital. That something is called hope. In the days following the Marathon bombing, this photograph showed the carnage at the finish line. Jeff Bauman was standing next to one of the bombs when it detonated, obliterating his legs. A day later, from his hospital bed, Bauman scribbled a note. "I know what happened." He's a real hero, my son. He's helpin' this city heal. Be Boston Strong. FEMALE REPORTER: Is that true, Jeff? Are you Boston Strong? PATTY: You did real good today, kiddo. That kind of exposure, you know... That could lead to opportunities. Make things, you know, easier for ya... - Yeah. - ...down the line. You got a call from Carlos. He wants to visit with ya. And we should be thankful for him. (WHIRRING) PATTY: In here. Hey. Sir, how you doin'? - Hi. How are you? - Paul Martino. - How are you, Paul? - Nice to meet you. Uh, casts shouldn't take more than... - Hour, hour and a half. - Okay. Cast is a very quick procedure, but it's the most important part. If we get a good impression of you, then the rest of the procedure is gonna go nicely. - You okay? - Yeah. We're gonna start on this side, okay? We're gonna slip a sock on you here. It's just a cotton stocking that... This is so that when we wrap the plaster on you, it doesn't stick directly to your skin. GREIG MARTINO: D'you hear the one where the farmer was paintin' his bathroom? Figured he'd shellac the toilet seat, make it look prettier. He didn't tell his wife. Daughter says, "What's the matter, Dad? Ain't you ever seen one of these before?" He says, "Yeah, I just never saw anybody frame it." (LAUGHTER) GREIG: Sorry, sorry. Sorry, Jeff. PATTY: Don't make him laugh too hard. PAUL: ...allow this to get hard. And then we're gonna make a slice in it. We're gonna take it right off you, okay? Maybe you could, uh, use your new legs for next week at the Bruins game, huh? JEFF: Ma, that's, like, in a week. PAUL: Give me a couple of weeks of fabrication and delivery. PATTY: Get outta here. PAUL: Couple of weeks, Jeff, you'll be up. PATTY: I can't wait. PAUL: We can get you up any time. We're gonna clean up this side and then we'll go on and do the right. We'll be just as quick and... PATTY: I wanna have it signed. - PAUL: Less pain. Okay... - Yeah, yeah. ...but at least you know what to expect. Right. PATTY: They've asked him to go out on the ice and wave the flag. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) COMMENTATOR: Jonny Gomes coming to the plate here - for the Red Sox. - (CLAPPING) Go, Jonny! Get us a fuckin' hit. COMMENTATOR: Be one to one now. Don't swing at that shit. Let that shit go. COMMENTATOR: Gomes with a special bat in hand, to remember the victims of the Marathon... PATTY: Hey, Jeff! You hear that? His bat says "Boston Strong." UNCLE BOB: Hey, leave him be. He's snappin' a deuce. - SULLY: No, no, no, no, no! - (GRUNTS) UNCLE BOB: God damn it. PATTY: Not too good, huh? UNCLE BOB: No, he fouled up. After everything we've been through? Haven't we suffered enough? Hey, so is he gonna do it? PATTY: Oh, I dunno. He's nervous. He's nervous about what? SULLY: Jeff, we heard about the Bruins game! Sounds pretty cool, bro. PATTY: They're gonna give us box seats. BIG D: Wait, us? PATTY: Said we could bring the whole crew. - Yo, you gotta do this, Jeff! - Free drinks! SULLY: Bruins need ya! BIG D: Don't be a pussy, bro! Shit. Ow! BIG D: What kinda food they got? UNCLE BOB: All-you-can-eat. SULLY: It's all-you-can-eat, Jeff.

I hope that I didn't get ya at a bad time, but I, uh, you know, it's the, uh, Bruins playoff game against Chicago next week and they asked me to come out there on the ice. (CHUCKLES) On the ice? Yeah, I'm not, like, on the... Not to play, but, y'know, to be the banner captain and, like, wave the flag and shit. It's kind of like singin' the national anthem, but for people who suck at singing. You sure you wanna do that? Well, everybody says I should. It's the Stanley Cup, so... Listen, Erin, I... I know we're not together, but... I was just, um... I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come with me and my family. I don't think that I could do it without you. And I know that it's not really fair of me to say. I'm really... I'm sorry, um... But I... (VOICE BREAKS) (VOICE QUIVERING) I really need you right now. And, uh, please. Okay. Yeah.

ERIN: Patty, all those people looking at him, asking him questions - and needing something. - Yeah, butt out. Come on, Jeffrey, talk to me. ERIN: It's a lot of pressure. And somebody's always tryin' to take something from him. - It's too much, Patty. - You gonna let her do this or you gonna tell me for yourself? I wanna hear from you. You're not so drunk... - ERIN: I'm speaking for him. - ...ya can't speak to me. ERIN: If you would listen to me... No, you don't speak for my son. JEFF: Why'd you... Why didn't you tell me sooner? What? Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why do you think? I wanted to make it a surprise. I wanted a big announcement. You know? It's Oprah Winfrey. I'm sorry, Ma. PATTY: Where would I have been without Oprah? She got me through the bad times. And I don't know where, what I would be. I would've... I would've hung myself in the bathroom without Oprah. Just sayin'. Just sayin'. So, hey, if Oprah's your lifeline, you got a lot deeper issues, Patty. - I'm just sayin'. - Fuck you, Bob. Shut up, Bob. I just wanted people to see how amazing my son is.

Why were you there? At the finish line? Yeah, I mean, y'know, like, based on that hat and my limited knowledge of aerodynamics, I assume it wasn't to run. (CHUCKLES) No, no, I... I wasn't there to run, I... I was there for my boys. They were running in the... No, no, my... My boys are dead. Shit. They died years ago. Uh... Oh. Thank you. Do you have kids? JEFF: Mmm. Uh... CARLOS: Mmm. Alex, uh, was my oldest. Uh, he was a Marine, but he got killed by a sniper in Najaf. You know, the way I find out is, a van pulls up in front of my house and... And three Marines, they get out. But I knew. I knew before they rang the doorbell, I knew. And then I did something very stupid, right? I grabbed a can of gasoline and a blowtorch and I ran past them and... (STAMMERS) And I locked myself in their van. They tried to pull me out. The... The blowtorch sparked and I, um... (SNIFFLES) Those Marines, they could have died, and they saved me. The worst part is, I... I had to go to my son's funeral on a stretcher. I'm not proud of that, you know. What about your other son? Brian. You remind me of Brian. He took his own life. It was too much for him. You know, losing his brother, and seeing me like that. (SNIFFLES) Shit, Carlos. I can't tell you how much I wish I had been there for them when they needed me. Hmm. But now I... I travel the country, talking to soldiers. Mostly about PTSD and depression. I help a little. And it keeps me going. But the truth is... I don't understand. Mmm. (SIGHS) I was there that day at the finish line handing out American flags for my boys. When the first bomb went off, I looked up and I saw a big ball of fire and my body wanted to run. But I thought, this is a moment, huh? Make a better choice. So I ran to the fire and there you were. Helping you made me feel like I had helped my son. And for that, I am grateful. You're grateful? Yeah. You help me as much as I help you. And I came here to say, "Thank you." Hmm. (SIGHS) (PANTING) (INAUDIBLE) Straight to voicemail, huh? I don't blame ya. Listen, I've been thinking, um... You know, our... Our kid, he or she is, uh... Gonna have legs. You're gonna be, like, a really good mom. 'Cause you been dealin' with a big, dumb kid already. Sittin' here, uh, bein' without you, it's like the worst fuckin' thing that's ever happened to me. By a long shot. There was this, like, there was this time in the hospital when, like, I... I just wanna give up. Y'know, like, where I... Just, like, didn't care if I... SULLY: Come on. Come on. JEFF: ...died or not. And... Now I just wanna... SULLY: Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, man. JEFF: I just wanna walk. Y'know, I just wanna stand up. I wanna see the world from higher up, y'know? I just... I just wanna be normal. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) BIG JEFF: Conference on the mound. BIG D: You wanna just go out there and just make a fool outta yourself in front of everybody? UNCLE BOB: You can't do it like this. What, I got the catcher walkin' out to the... BIG D: Let's go, Coach. What? BIG JEFF: I'm gonna put him in. What are you talkin' about? I threw one ball, guys. BIG D: It's your whole shoulder, your whole body... UNCLE BOB: Aim for his balls, he's wearin' a cup. See, that's a little better. How 'bout you throw that over the plate? BIG D: Here we go. UNCLE BOB: Oh, Jesus Christ! That's terrible. Thirty-seven thousand fans are gonna be booin' your ass. You're all messed up, all right? (AUNT JENN LAUGHS) So listen to me. Just listen. All right? You're a bunch of fuckin' disasters. BIG D: Jesus. AUNT JENN: You got that right. But I wouldn't trade ya in for anything. So just do me a favor, all right? Help me out? - All right? - Let's go. Okay. (ALL AGREE) BIG JEFF: Come on, buddy, muscle memory. You know how to do this. JEFF: And now it's just about healing, getting better and showin' the world I'm fine and that, y'know, I'm not gonna let this hold me down, y'know, 'cause then maybe if they see that, then maybe they won't let stuff hold them down, either. And y'know there's always gonna be pain, I think, y'know, but, I dunno, I just wanna, like... (ERIN PANTING) JEFF: ...live.
