[Mandy] Dear Mommy, Happy Valentine's Day! I love you. Love, Mandy. [Tom] Aw, that's sweet. She's going to like that. [screeching tires] You know, it's too bad all these pretty lights have to mean something bad happened. -When are we going to go pick up Mommy? -Well I got to go do something for a few minutes, punk. And then we'll go get Mommy, OK? [Mandy] OK! [Tom] Until then, I'm just going to take your nose... [chuckle] So I don't get lonely. I'll be right back, all right? [zipping] [car door closes] [indistinct chatting] Hey Jack, my wife is on the work. -Hold it, Tom. You don't want to go over there. Wait for the sheriff. -What are you talking about?

She wanted to leave early today. I said, OK. [Tom] It was Ward Lamson, wasn't it? Oh, my God, Harriett. [Jack] Tom, if there's anything I can do for you. I can take care of little Mandy or anything. I'll help you, Tom, don't worry. [an officer] We have someone! -We got somebody here. [seatbelt unclipping] [suspenseful music] [Jack] Oh, my God. Ray! -You know this guy? [an officer] Hey, hey, let's get him out of here. Get him out of here. -He talked about Harriett. Extreme nonparaphilic... sexual attachment. I tried to turn his affections away from her. I thought the therapy was working. Gosh, I'm sorry, Tom. I'm really sorry. -Bye-bye, Mommy. [school bell rings] [students chattering] -So... what are you going to do? -I don't know, man. -Hey, sexy! -Don't be a dick.... -Oh! Your mom is going to be giving a lecture in health class, today. -No, shit! -Yes! [indistinct conversations] -No, mom, I don't need your help, but thank you anyway. Yes, I know he needs a man around the house. I do too. I just don't meet a lot of qualified candidates. Yes... oh, thank you. Look, mom, I got to go. No, no, no, it's fine, I got to go. OK. Bye. [chatter] Hi, sweetie! -Hey. [embarrassed scuff] You're not going to talk to the health class today, are you? -Don't worry, I won't embarrass you... -Thanks. -...too much. [chuckle] [Jannelle] Anyway, thanks for the ride. -Hm. Yes. Uh. Lay off, daddy-oh! All you guys do is suck face! [Blake] You're such a dweeb. [fake purring] [giggles] -Hey, Mike. -So, we're on? -Tonight... beers out, clothes off. [laughter] [cheers] -Speaking of which, you clowns owe me 20 a piece. -Got you. -No problem. [indistinct chatting] [rock music] [indistinct] [Bradley] I'm broke. Catch me later. -Yo man, I'll catch you at the pool. -Bye, see you guys. -Bye. -So did you see the decorations in the gym? They're like nauseating. We are so not going to that dance. -Ah it's cool, we'll just chill with the friends. -Oh yes, great. And hang out with the usual group of idiots? See you. Bye, Bradley. -Dude, I have got to break up with this chick. [scuffs] [Jack] Do you want to talk about it? [chains jangeling] This anger, this rage that has consumed your life... Let's talk about that night. You went up there, just like always, to watch them, the young boys, the young girls, doing what you wanted to do, what you dreamed of doing. [chains clinking] I can help you, Ray. But you have to help me. You have to make the effort. I want you to tell me... I want to hear you say the words. I want you to admit it. [chains clattering] You killed those two young people. You took that steal hook... and you butchered them. Tell me... Tell me and you'll be free. [Jack] Tell me, Ray. Tell me. [sighs] [steps out] [whistle] [water splashing] [a guy] Hey, what are you doing in state this year? -100-meter. -How come you're not practicing? -I was given the day-off for the big meet. [Jannelle] Hey, I'm going to go get a coke. Do you want anything? -No, thanks. [a guy] Hey man, what's up with you and Chloe? -I don't know. I mean, she's been really weird lately. You know, like she's not herself. [musique rock] -Hey, Bradley. -Hey. Sorry to hear about the bad news. -What bad news? -About Michael... dumping you. -Hi. -Hi. -I'm Jannelle Bay. -Mandy Anderson. -Yes, I know. [chuckling] -You're new, right? -Yes. -Well, congratulations on making the squad. -Thanks. -Hey... what do you know about Michael Lamson? -Nothing really. We've kind of avoided each other. -Oh...How come? -It's a really long story. -Who the fuck do you think you are? [whistle] [indistinct yelling] [water dripping] -You're going to pay for this. [door opening] [dog softly growls] [Jack] Good, lie down. We don't need the law here. [Penny] There have been three acts of violence in my school this year. I'm setting an example. -Well fine, make an example of the first two kids... not Chloe. -Frankly, Jack, your daughter needs some serious anger management. -Well... Well, Tom, why don't you arrest the Lamson boy? After all, we don't know if anyone's safe with him running around loose. He could be a sexual addict just like his father. -Excuse me... [Sheriff Anderson] Jack, look. Nobody is going to get arrested here unless somebody starts something, all right? We're here to talk about this as three adults. -You've always had this... fixation on Penny... haven't you, Tom? Come on boy, come on. [dog gently growls] [Penny] Your daughter is suspended for a week. [door slams] It's quite a brother you've got there. -Half-brother. Look, Penny... -Uh... I have a lot of work to do. [a girl] Yes, but you like this town? -Yes, no, I like...I mean, I've lived here all my life So it's like I don't know anything else. -Yes, everyone seems really nice. -Yes. Yes, it's a good town. [together] Hey... -Hello, Mandy. You're looking more like your mother everyday. [dog growls] I've got to get back to work. Come on. -You do not want that girl mad at you. -Is she like the queen of the school? -No, she's on the varsity psycho squad. [Jannelle] What do you mean? [Mandy] Well her dad, he's a schrink at the asylum. And her mom killed herself. -God... -Yes. -So, you're not going to tell me, huh? -I don't know. [sigh] I don't think it's anything, all right? I just think it's something I'm going to have to figure out on my own. -Okay, well, you want to talk to somebody? You want to talk to a man? -God! Mom, are you kidding me? -No, no, I just thought... -Mom. You're fine, all right? You're great. -Okay, you get in the house. And remember, you're grounded. So that means put your nose in the book, and no TV, no... no radio, no phone. Got it? -All right. -I love you, honey. -Love you too, mom. -Hope you... enjoy the book. Doctor... Jack... Grefe. [alarm buzzer] [dramatic music] Go, go! Downstairs! Check in his cell. Come on! Oh good God. No! Not Chloe. [Penny] I know that today is Valentine's day. And I know that you all have romance in your hearts, and love on your minds. And I know that some of you may be even having a party. So what I want to say is this. [laughs] Be careful! [bell ringing] -I'd like you all to thank principal Lamson. And don't forget the chapter on STDs. [chatter] -Sorry. [sigh] -He's out. -We've got a party happening, man. And I've got a fucking six-pack! -Shh! -Will you can it, bud? You still need a date! -Yeah, if you're going to hang out with us. -Hey, I can get a date! [glass shattering] Oh, shit! -My office. Watch your step. [Tim - phone] So get this. It busts all over the stairs and who's standing right behind him? Your mom. [Michael] Why? So my mom actually caught him? [Tim - phone] Yeah, he's probably in her office right now getting spanked, the little dork. -So he's still driving, right? [Tim - phone] He better be. I'm not walking up to Lovers' lane. -Who's his date? [Tim - phone] Who's yours? -Oh look, man, my mom's home. No, I gotta bounce, dude. [Tim - phone] Hey, look, Mike... -I don't wanna hear about her right now. Look, just meet me at the Speedy Mart at nine o'clock. And don't leave me hanging, all right? [Tim - phone] Whatever man, peace. -Yeah, I'll talk to you later. [announcer - radio] Police have still failed to apprehend escaped murder Ray Hennessy, convicted 13 years ago for the Valentine's day slaying of a young couple at a remote road known as Lovers' lane. Murdered during an alleged affair, one of those victims, Harriet Anderson, was the wife of current Neston county sheriff, Tom Anderson. The other slain victim, Ward Lamson, is survived by his wife, Penny Lamson, who is now principal at Quinly senior high school. Both victims left behind...-Hey. -What are you doing outside? -Look, I just wanted to say that... -No, you get back in the house right now. -I'm sorry. [swing music] [pins clattering] [beeping] [muffled speaking] -Cathy, I got another gutter ball. -Jannelle, that's all you get. Sorry. -Oh, hey, Doug, did you talk to Mike for me? -Um, no, no. I... I haven't. Hey, uh... You know that... that hook guy, right? -Hook? -Yeah. -Yeah, yeah, that story. -Cathy, you know that story about the hook guy? [Cathy] Yeah, like in girl scouts? -Yeah, yeah, that guy, he gets blown up, but he doesn't die. But his face gets all melted and nasty looking. -Oh, just like you! [Jannelle] Yeah, so his hand gets blown off, and it's just like this shredded stump. -Stump, that's something you'd know about, huh, Doug? [Doug] It really happened! The hook's out, he went over a wall today. -No, no, no, the way I heard it was that he escaped in a laundry check. Like in dirty sheets that he pulled over... -He killed Todd Hasting's father. I saw Todd in the office, his mom was crying, I even saw an ambulance on the way here! -That's sick. Doug, you're sick! [Jannelle] You know, I think something like that happened to Michael. -Yeah, it happens everywhere, Jannelle. -Did I mention he left a note? -What'd it say? -It said that he'd leave us a good kegger or two. -Oh shit. -You are such a dick. [Janelle] No, you're a dweeb! [Cathy] Oh my God! -Okay, okay! All right, I was kidding about the note, but everything else was true, I swear! [Brad] What are you doing? -Taking off those glasses. [Brad] Well, cool it, would you, we're going to get in a shit load of trouble. All right, just... -He's not going to do anything. My uncle is the sheriff. My dad is not going to let him touch me. So just relax. -Oh, man! Oh, la, la, la! -Hey, how are you doing? -Hey. -What? -God, I wish I was her daddy. [Tom] Jack Grefe? Why? [David] Look at 'em, she's just about screwing him right in front of us. -Yeah, so what about being Jack? -So if I was Jack, I'd get to spank her when she got home. [laugh] -And I'd get to bust your perverted ass. [laugh] Look, I need you to keep an eye on Chloe for me, all right? -With pleasure. -No, seriously. This guy, we think he's after Grefe, and we don't want Chloe to get caught in the crossfire, all right? -You've got it, chief. -I'll see you. [pop music] Hey, pumpkin, how you doing? -Hi, daddy. -Are you okay? You need some money or something? -No, I'm fine. -All right. Try and get home before dark, all right? I worry about you. [sad music] -Hey, look who jumped back? -What's wrong with her? -I can't believe she has the nerve to come here all by herself. -All right, dick, you've got your date for tonight. -I don't get why you guys are so mean to her, she's really nice. [phone ringing] [Penny] Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, no, no, I'm fine, I just... Yeah. No, I'm fine... Mom, no, I don't think he's going to get... Mom, please. Please, listen, I don't think he's going to do that. I think he's long gone by now. Yeah, okay, listen, I've gotta go, I'll call you later. Okay. [beeping] -Oh, hey. It's nice to see you again. [imitating purring] [panting] Yeah... Hey, cutie... -Hi there. -Holy shit! -Oh, relax, Dougie, your secret's safe with me. -The hell do you want? [Chloe] I want to get even with Michael for dumping me. And I want to have some fun. -Well, uh... -Brad and I are going up to Lovers' lane. Make sure that Michael finds us there. -Okay. [Brad] Yeah! Yeah, it's what I'm talking about. All right. Hey, Tim. What's up? -The fuck you doing, man? -What, this? Her? -It's Michael's girl. -Not anymore. -Whatever, man. -Tim... I don't need this. [romantic music] -Shit. [sigh] I have to ask you a favour. -Okay, what? -You know, uh... You're looking really, really fine tonight. I like the way, uh... the colour of your sweatshirt brings out your skin. -It's green. [sigh] -Okay, I'm going to tell you something, but you've gotta promise that it'll die with you, okay? You've gotta promise that no matter what you say, you're not going to tell anyone that I even asked. -Why don't you just tell me what you want? -I need a date, you know, for tonight, like, right now. -What's your rush? -Well see, it's that I made this bet, and... -Wait a second, Romeo! What kind of a loser lineis that? -No, it's the truth, I swear. I'm serious. -No way. -Okay, okay. Let's be straight with each other. When was the last time someone asked you out on a date? -None of your business. -It's been six months for me. -Okay. -So we help each other out. I win my bet, your popularity pegs up a little. Our dry spells are over. [knocking] -Come in. -Hey, good night, hun, I'm going to turn in now. -Good night. -Michael, I'm sorry that I got so short with you earlier, but I did have to suspend you. -Yeah. Yeah, I understand, it's cool. -Okay. Good night. -Uh, mom? -Yeah? Is there something going on that I don't know about? You know, because if there is, you can talk to me. -Yeah, I... Michael, there is something that I should have told you about your father a long time ago. -What about dad? -He would have been very proud of you. -Really? Thanks. -Okay. -I'll see you in the morning, okay? -Okay, good night. [Chloe] Hey, pull over, I've gotta go do something. -I'm telling you, we don't need beer. -I'm not here for the beer. Meet me around back. How's it going? [dramatic music] [radio chatter] [dramatic music] [door squeaking] [suspenseful music] -Chloe? Chloe? [heavy breathing] [suspenseful music] [screams] [knocking] -Hey, you know Michael, I was... Oh! my god, Michael, oh! my god.

Mike's a friend of mine. -And that's the whole point, isn't it? [heavy breathing] -Did you hear something? -Oh! come on, don't tell me that you're scared. -Shit no, I just ... -Just relax, okay? -Jesus, what are you doing? -Self actualizing. -I, I can't. -Look, in case you haven't noticed, I happen to be the best piece of ass in this town. Now, how is it gonna sound when I tell everyone in school that you're just another big mouth with a limp dick? [moans] -We're leaving. -No, you are gonna fuck me right now or I'm gonna kill your fagot ass. [car stopping] [papers ruffling] -Hello? -Hi, what are you doing here? What time is it? We haven't found him yet, we've got roadblocks up... -Wait, wait, wait a minute. How did you know he was missing? -What do you mean, how did I know, I'm the one who came to... -No, no, no, no, Michael is missing. -Michael is missing? -Yes. -How long? -I don't know, I, we've looked all over town for him. -Lacey, put on an all call, I wanna know if anybody's seen Michael Lamson. He's 5'11", he's 16 years old, blond and blue and... What was he wearing? -I don't know. -Let me know., [voice on the radio] -Will do Chief. -This must have been hard for you to come here. -No, where else could I go, you're the Sheriff. -Oh! Penny. I wish we could get past this issue, it's so old but... Don't you know that night was just, it was... It was fate, it was bad luck that Harriet and Ward were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ward was cheating on you. -No, Ward was not cheating on me. -Yes, he was and Harriet was cheating on me. -You just accept that? -Yes, I accept that. I have to because they found... They found evidence. Come on, please, can't we get past this? -This time, it will be our kids. -Jesus H. Christ, what, what, you think this guy in on a vendetta? Is that what you think? That's just plain crazy. -Where's Mandy? -Mandy's at home, why? -Call her. -Why? -Just call her. -Alright.

You still like her, don't you? -Who, Chloe? -Yeah. -Right. -Well, I mean, she's a complete bitch, but it's still sweet you care. -Oh! my god, it's so obvious. Like, the only reason why you're not out there with Tim, is 'cause you still want to get in her pants. -Cath... -This is so pathetic. Oh!, the lesbo librarian speaks. -Shut up Cathy. -Whatever. -This is so stupid. -Shit! -Come on, just a few more steps. -My god! -Jesus Christ, you guys. -Shit! -Timmy, Timmy?

He's not gonna come in here after you. -How do you know? -Because he's after Michael and me. -What? Whoa, wait a second. What are you trying to say here, huh? -You don't think it was just some coincidence that he was up here tonight, do you? -You're fucking crazy, you know that? What about Tim and Cathy, huh? -They were just in the way, Michael! Don't you see? This is just like how it was before with my mom and your dad! -My dad died of a heart attack. -Your dad was murdered at Lovers' lane by that bastard out there. [Michael] Fuck you. [crying] Fuck you, okay? Fuck you! -Who told you about your dad? Your mom, right? -What are you doing, Mandy? -Yeah, what the fuck are you doing, Mandy? -Look, I saw it, okay, I was four years old! And they took my mom away in a body bag, and then they came for your dad! -So what are you trying to say, huh? That your mom and my dad were a thing, huh? -Michael, you really don't know? Yes, they were a thing, they were a hot item in high school. My dad's convinced they were having an affair, but I know that's a lie. -How would you know? You were only four years old! -You think your dad was a good guy, right? -Yes, I know he was. -How would you know, Michael? You were only four. -So what is this, huh? Is this like history repeating itself? -Yeah. -Why? -I don't know, Michael. Obsession? The guy is crazy, ask my uncle. All I know is that if we don't find a car, we're going to die here! So will you please help me? [suspenseful music] [deep breathing] [cat hissing] [Tom] Jesus Christ. God damn cat. [dramatic music] [water boiling] [suspenseful music] [gasping] -It's me, it's me! -God damn it, you almost got shot! -You almost got stabbed! -What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the car! -I got worried. -How did you get in? -Under the mat. -Perfect. -I ought to be the sheriff. -Be my guest. -There it is. [Mandy] Okay, I see it. -Okay, okay. You go left, and I'm gonna go right. -Okay. -Go. [screaming] Fuck, you're supposed to go left! -Well, if I'm gonna go left then give me the gun! -Why? You don't even know how to use a gun! -Well I'm the girl! -So? -Well you didn't exactly look like Wyatt Earp yourself, back there in the house,okay? God. -Okay, fine, fine! We'll go together, okay? -Good. -Just don't trip, okay? [suspenseful music] How the hell do farmers see in this shit? -They probably know where the light switch is, Michael. -Wait, did you hear that? I heard something. -That's just the sound of your sweating. -Shut up, I'm serious. [screaming] [gun shot] [pig squealing] [Mandy] Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. Shit! It's a stupid pig! -Jeez, Michael, you almost shot Babe! -Yeah, and I just used our last shell, too! Oh, just great, just great! We have juice, and no keys! Try the glove box. -Good, I found it. [Michael] Cool, how's the keys situation? -Nothing. -Shit, shit, shit! Here, give me this. Here, take this from me, shine it down here, all right? -Since when does a straight A student know how to hotwire a car? [Michael] Auto shop. -Dougie, wake up! Dougie, please, please, wake up. Come on, Dougie. [creaking] No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No! Dougie? Please. [suspenseful music] [scratching] Michael? [scratching] [screaming] [glass shattering] [dramatic music] [panting] [screaming] [groaning] [suspenseful music] -Look... I didn't do anything. I mean, I know you're pissed off, but... Whatever it is, it wasn't me. I just wanted to get laid. That's all. Hey... Oh my God! Oh my God, this is not what I had in mind! Please! [screaming] Oh, God! Damn it! No! [screaming] [Michael] Okay, I want you to put your foot down here, right? And when I say, "hit it," you hit it. What do you think? Hey, watch out! -Sorry! -Red or green? -I don't know, green! Red! [engine choking] -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah! -Michael? [engine running] -Don't over flood it! -Michael! Michael, he's in here! Get in the car! Michael! Get in the car! -He's here? -Wait, wait! You have to wait! -No, I'm fucking going! -Okay, now. [screaming] -Oh fuck! What the fuck was that? Let's go, follow me! Let's go! Fuck, come on!

[explosion] Burn, motherfucker! [tragic music] [Tom] Check the study, and I'll look in Jack's bedroom. Do you know anything about Jack and a girlfriend? -Michael gave that bear to Chloe. Tom, come here. [Tom] What? [Penny] This is Mandy. -It's my wife. [Mandy's voice] Dear mommy. Happy Valentine's day! I love you. Love, Mandy. [Mandy] Oh my God, Michael! [Michael] Oh, shit! What do we do? -I don't know Michael, everyone we know is dead. Oh my God, it moved! -If we move her she might die, don't touch her! -If we don't move her, she's going to die! -Help me! -Shit, we can help you! We're going to get you help! -Somebody help Brad! -Don't worry about it, okay? We're just going to get you to a hospital. Grab her by the shoulders. -Brad! -Brad is fucking dead! -No, Brad is alive, and he's at Lovers' lane! I swear, Michael, I'm so sorry! -It's all right. -I'm so sorry but you have to help me out! -It's okay. Shit! Shit. Hurry up, Mandy, hurry up! -Coming! -Have you got anything yet? -No, it just keeps ringing. [Mandy] Where's Brad's car? [Michael] I don't know. [phone ringing] -Stop, stop. Did you hear that? -No, what? Mandy, where are you going? Mandy! -I don't want to die like this. -Chloe, you're not going to die, all right? -Will you please stay with me? -I promise, okay? I promise. [phone ringing] -Hello? -Mandy? -Daddy? [Tom - phone] Mandy, is that you, Mandy? -Oh my God, daddy, everybody is dead! Everybody is dead! -Pumpkin, where are you? [screaming] -Michael! -Mandy! [screaming] -Nobody dumps me! Fuck! -Fuck! [groaning in pain] -Who is that? -Mandy, damn it! It was Mandy! [screaming] [Mandy] Oh God! Michael! [screaming] -Hello, Mandy. -Shit! -Fuck! -You're beautiful. You're so much like your mother. [crying] -You killed her! -It was his fault! He interrupted me! I was trying to make your mother see how I felt about her. She wouldn't listen, she started yelling! And he came in... One glimpse and he became mad. Well, I took care of him! But... you were there, you saw it all. You saw it all and you started screaming! And screaming, and screaming! [screaming] -Son of a bitch! -Take that, bitch! [screaming] -Fuck! Shit! Fuck, yearbook photos! Damn it, daddy, look at my face! You said that you were going to help me! I was the one that took care of Doug and that slut, Jannelle! The least thing you could do is get rid of miss goodie-two-shoes and my soon to be very ex-boyfriend. Daddy? Daddy, are you okay? Did those bastards hurt you? Here, hold still while I take this thing off, okay? Oh... [screaming] -Don't you know I love you? I love you! Don't you see that! I'm the only one who ever has loved you! No one else has ever loved you like I have! [screaming] -You sick motherfucker! [screaming] [Michael] Come on! [Mandy] Oh my God! Oh my God! -Oh fuck! Oh fuck! -Oh God! -Oh shit, oh shit! -Michael? Michael! Michael, Michael! Michael! -Shit! [screaming] -My baby... [roaring in anger] -Michael, Michael! [screaming] [gunshot] -Little brother Tommy. [gunshots] [sobbing] -Michael, Michael! Get up, Michael! -Mandy, Michael, get out of here! -Michael! -Son of a bitch. [dramatic music] [grunting] [grunting in pain] [tragic music] -Oh, baby, it's over. It's over. -Sweetheart? That's it, that's it, get up. -Come on. -Get up, Michael. -Michael, come on! -Well, I'll... I'll check in the car. -Are you done with these two? -Yeah. -All right guys, let's get you home. -Dad, I just want to say that... I knew mom never cheated on you. -I don't believe it. Your brother, I still don't believe it. -So, the guy with the hook, he... he was just some crazy guy? -Jack had 13 years to work on it. Who knows what he is now. -Sheriff, squad car is here. -You guys go with the deputy, I'll be right behind you. -Take them home! [hip-hop music] Closed captioning is provided by Studio Sonogram.
