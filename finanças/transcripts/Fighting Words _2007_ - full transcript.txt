Man: This is a recipe for poetry. Begin with a healthy portion of heartache, thick and juicy. Add a pinch of debt, dash of despair, a lot of rocks. ...shout across time at the injustice and confusion of a life made far more than just bearable by you. I hadn't realized that you made it all the way into my genes, love as stable as a grease fire, hope as twisted as a strand of DNA. Woman: Only half the time I'm coming. The other half, I'm faking. Half growing, half shrinking, half above water, half sinking. Half midnight, half shooting star blazing, and half of what y'all think of me deeply affects me. The other half doesn't faze me. 3rd man: Where are my silver dollars gonna come from, and when will I take shelter from a thunderstorm again in a milking shed, ankle-deep in cow shit with that dust bowl freckled soldier, that moonshine newlywed and hard times husband... 2nd woman: Jam up miniskirts, arm, hands hang out short sleeves. Food never disappoints you, never breaks your heart, food doesn't show up late, doesn't complain about sex. Eat! That's what agri-business wants. Gobble, munch, chomp, and swallow. 3rd woman: Somebody trying to make love to somebody. Someone trying to make somebody, someone love me enough. Can't trust this anymore, pretend to ignore anymore. I was only 11 years old at my brother Jason's funeral. We stood in the falling rain off the 405 freeway. An open grave stared at me. They covered the leftover pile of dirt with astroturf. My mother was horrified at the people attending the funeral. I thought they were funny. It was Noah's ark for decadence, the odd and the occult. My parents were in a hurry to leave. They'd seen enough. I never got to say goodbye. He was sick for two years before he died. He wrote me stories and poems. They were great. This is for him. It's called, uh... It's called burning a rat. Ahem. Man: Get on with it! I find him lying by the door, legs outstretched as if he died in mid-leap. I pick him up by the tail. He's loose, beyond the first stiffness of death. Party's over. Time to head home. Suddenly, I want to burn him. Surprised by my own desire to save him from slow decay, fetid rearrangements of his parts, or so I tell myself. But, mostly, I just want to see him burn. Drop him on a wire screen that covers the 40-gallon drum, reflections of fire in my eyes, as I am strangely satisfied. Whiskers furl into quick question marks and are gone. Wilted fur, black and dry, long nightmare tail... No! Holds on longer than I thought. As hours pass, it is the only thing left, white length of ash like the backbone of something prehistoric, seen from a great distance. Great crowd tonight, Gabe. It's your job to make them listen. Jake. Jake, my man, that was heavy. This next guy coming up is our last poet. Put your hands together for teezer! [Applause and cheering] Thank you, Gabriel. My first condom. I am shopping for a condom I may soil for my love. I am shopping for a condom I may lubricate thereof. Stand did she in sweet chastity until I broke that lock. It seemed so drastic, a piece of plastic wrapped round my cock. But procreation and masturbation do not walk hand in hand. And little babies or a case of rabies is not what I had planned. So wrap do I... Unbelievable. My third eye with red-ribbed prophylactic. And you must with plastic trust if you wish to be sexually active. [Cheering] Okay. All right. Now is the time for you to exercise your supreme right to vote for the best poet in the house. My able-bodied assistant will pass among thee and thou and collect the votes, all right? Get on it. Do it now. Jake. This is my friend, marni. Great poem. Your performance could use a little work. Let's get a drink. No, let's get out of here. Uh, marni is an editor with windsor house. Yeah. I'd love to see some of your work sometime. Well, Lisa knows where to find me. Okay. Tonight's winner of the $50 catchword poetry slam is teezer! Yeah! Yeah! My man! Baby! All right! Bad vote. But at least you had something to say. Yeah, well, the best poet always loses. Come on. [Crowd chanting teezer's name] And it was then that they decided the human language did not have enough of an extensive vocabulary to withhold the awesome power of this man's beauty. And I knew, right then and there, that it was my duty to invent a new word, one that's so absurd every time it's heard it will cause your pulse to race and simultaneously cause your face to completely relax. And it will only be allowed to be uttered when a person turns a poet into a mime, when they are so fine, it makes you wonder if they are entirely silicone. [Knock on door] [Knocking] [Knocking] [Garage door opener whirring] Hey, Mr. Berto. Where is your rent? Well, actually, uh, right now, I don't exactly have it. The rent. How about I pay you a little interest maybe? You know? Like... Papaya-breasted women, lounging around a pool, like, uh, chameleons by the fire. One of them smiles at you, her chili-red lips whispering Baja sea breezes. &quot;i want to taste your wine, Mr. Berto.&quot; she can call me fulgencio. Fulgencio. &quot;fulgencio, let me feel you. &quot;i want to feel your love. Sweep me away in a breaking orgasm wave.&quot; ohh. Rolling tides of... Of thunderous... No poetry. It is the work of the devil. No more poetry! You are dangerous, peligroso. The landlord wants me to evict you. Shit. Why are you stopping? Because you should. [Both panting] I'm going to go get the car. Would you stop worrying about me? I'm fine. Okay, okay. My problem's David. We were up all night fighting. Did you break up, I hope? He's so good with words. You caved in again. He's egotistical, unfaithful. He doesn't care about anybody but himself. He cares about me, and he's talented. You are such a pushover for that kind of guy. His book signing's today. You are so...So thrilling. These poems pale in comparison to your smile. How are you? It's time we looked at more poets. Oh, please. Poetry's a money pit. That's a switch. You're the one who brought settles here in the first place. He's one of a kind. He's a star. He transcends poetry. Thank you very much. Poetry is 3% of our list. But people are writing poetry, performing it, listening to it. We need to make a move on this before it breaks out. Breaks out? Like a teenager's face? [Coughs] You really need to gargle. Well, see what you can find. David! It's a shitty idea. [Engine stops] What's going on? What's up, pal? Check this out. Depression! It's sucking me to hell. Depression! It's peeling out my soul. Peeling me, and then &quot;Orange,&quot; and I need something that rhymes with &quot;Orange.&quot; etch, I don't think anything rhymes with orange. I'm going to pop this pencil right in my eye, man, if I don't figure this thing out. Would you help me write some lyrics for this song? Ah, I don't do songs. No, I've got the melody. It's all done. It's all in my head. I just need some words... About depression and oranges. I can do depression. There it is. All right, uh, we'll talk about it after lunch. Promise? Yeah. All right. Well, first of all, these rolls have to be back there. That shit's supposed to go by the door. They're supposed to be in the corner. No. There's no way that those pieces of shit are more important than these pieces of shit. Well, now, that's poetic. Mama. What's up, mama? Hey, baby. Give me love. Mama? Etch: Mm-hmm. You guys know each other? We know each other from back in the day. A little bit. A little bit. Don't we? I told you I wanted to talk to you. Okay. Uh, can we do it outside, though? Hey, genius! Where do you think you're going? I, uh, was just... What? You heard what I said. Lunch. 15 minutes. That's it. Ham and peanut butter-- pure protein. Yeah. I want to read some more of your work. Oh, yeah? Well, it's not commercial. You're an expert on publishing? No, I just know what I write. One of our poets is getting six figures to do a basketball shoe commercial. How good are you? Really good. But it doesn't mean shit, 'cause nobody's interested in hearing it, anyway. I'm extremely interested. Why don't you meet me after work? Here's my portfolio. Are you serious? Wait, wait, wait, not that one. Oh. I wrote that after my brother... Uh, it's just the first poem I ever wrote. It's whatever. You're not going to be hovering, are you? Uh, no. I'm going to go to the store. Do you want anything? Mm-mmm. [Door opens] Jake. What's up, my friend? Hey, ralphie. You want a &quot;Vagenmaster&quot;? Yeah, but it's &quot;Jagermeister.&quot; &quot;jagermeister&quot;. I call it vagenmaster. What's the big deal? All right. It's 5.99. What's this? [Laughs] That's not money. Come on, man. That's just papers. No, no. I gotcha. Here you go. Here you go. All right. I'll see you later. Hang ten. You always pissed off? Just be happy you got out of bed and took a breath. Yeah, well, maybe your life's all happy and shit 'cause you got a good job, but the rest of the world is in the toilet, as I see it. So, basically, you have two emotions, anger and sarcasm. Sarcasm's not an emotion. Afraid of your own heart? Heh. No. I just wish people would listen, that's all. You need to market yourself. Enter the poetron slam. Slams are obviously not my thing. I mean, that guy won with a joke sex poem. Is that what that was? The slam's in town. You have nothing to lose. I don't need to win any spoken word races, thanks. Think of it as a career move. There's paychecks and pensions in poetry now? I didn't-- I didn't know. I'm going to a reading. You interested? David: This poem is called things to do at a poetry reading when you like a poem, but nobody else is clapping, and you don't want to be the only one. Try to look moved. Nod encouragement. Sigh. Say, &quot;Hmm.&quot; try to look very moved. Sneak around and ask some of the other people whether or not they like the poet. And if they do, make a pact to clap after the next poem, good or bad. Giggle. Guffaw. [Sniffs] Sniffle. Sob. Wail! Shift in your chair, crossing, re-crossing your shapely thighs. Take off your shirt and wave it at the poet, like a welcome home. Sing you light up my life. ♪ That I want you ♪ ♪ I need you ♪ ♪ I luh-huh-huh- huh-huh-huh-ove you ♪ Drag in marble block and sculpt the poet. Pull out a volume of Shakespeare's complete works and scratch out Shakespeare's name and write in the poet's. Transcribe the Bible onto a floppy disk. While using the &quot;Search and replace&quot; Command, substitute the poet's name for god. You can learn a lot from him. What? How to be an actor? He won the poetron slam last year. I don't care what he won. That guy is begging for applause. He's promoting his book. You're working in a warehouse. Jake, you're great, but it's still going to take a lot of work. I can get you read, but you have to want it, or it's a waste of my time. All right, we'll see. Do it, or settle for being a poetry slut, reading in front of 20 people. Look. My home is on the back. Get in touch when you've made up your mind. Good night. Okay. I'll see you. Thanks, man. Hey, Gabe, check this out. Love to see. See to love. To see love. [Laughs] You just got laid, huh? No. No. So, you think that's any good? It sucks. What the hell you writing about love for? I mean, why don't you write about something you know? What is that supposed to mean? Gabe.

He bolts it down too fast as usual. Two minutes later, he throws up on the back patio. The first fly shows up within seconds, ecstatic over life's bounty. Within minutes, the word's out somehow, the brothers and sisters coming in fast. The sun creeps along the cement floor. Pretty soon, half the cat puke is in light, the other in shadow like sunrise on a volcanic island. At least 30 flies have gathered by now, walking around and eating what they're walking around on. I move in closer. Such organization and grace. No fuss, no fighting. There's obviously always enough for everyone in the fly world and plenty of time to get off a quickie with your neighbor. I'm now on my hands and knees, my face within inches of the calm feeding of at least 50 flies, give or take arrivals and departures. None seem to notice me, the sun glinting off their emerald thoraxes and through their purple wings. Hey. Hey. I'm not sure if I got the right place. Uh, marni Elliot live here? Yeah, she's here. She's a little busy at the moment. Is there any way I can talk to her for a second? Um, she's getting dressed right now. I'm sorry. It's funny that she told me to come by. Huh. I got something I want to give her. What, has she got to sign for it? Because I'll give it to her. No. She don't gotta sign for it. Okay. Just a little, uh, something that I wrote. Will you give this to her? I'll make sure she gets it. Well, that's very nice of you. Thanks. &quot;cat puke and flies.&quot; you like that, huh? It's a good title. Profound. Yeah. Clown. You see, I like your hair like that. I don't know. I'm thinking about putting it down. No, no. It looks good up. Thank you. What's this? Oh, some guy came by, wanted me to give you that poem. Why didn't you get me? Because I never interrupt a woman when she's putting on her makeup. Not that you need it. His name's on it, unless, of course, he's too embarrassed. [Laughs] He's good. Totally different style than yours, though. Yeah, well, I'll take that as a compliment. Cat puke and flies. Come on. Let's get out of here. I need to schedule something with him. [Band warming up] Hello, brother. What are you guys doing here? What's up, pal? I'm about to serenade you. Look behind you. The boss lady hired me. Look, I asked etch to put one of your poems to music. Really? Without asking me? You know, you shouldn't have to put poetry to music in order for people to listen to it. Look. It's just an exercise to get you to learn about rhythm and phrasing. Okay? Okay. Let's hear it.

Swayed by stereo interludes, dancing with the thought of you via Cadence pacing. See, anticipation waits in cotton mouth. Is that you at my door? Got me looking forward to entrances and greetings. Goodbyes I can't get used to. I wasn't sure when you'd be home, so I let myself in. Yeah. Whatever. It's okay. How'd it go? Nothing special. You got a little something happening with this guy, huh? David, leave me alone. Little something on the side with your warehouse rat? He's a poet. Oh, I'm sorry. Now, you're defending him. Did you tell him you're HIV-positive? Because if you didn't, I'll be happy to. I can't believe you just said that to me. Come on, marni. I care about you. Come on. David, I don't want to see you anymore. What? Just like that?

[Crying] Woman: So for a short time, I will keep my eyes closed tight and let my lips curl around words like oysters, culturing small grains into pearls until the foundation of our world allows me to tell you how I feel. Until the silence doesn't allow the demons to seem so real. Until I can peel back these scarred layers, and beneath them, you find your match in a friend. You find a starting point for a relationship you'd like to begin. See, all these things, I constantly imagine intertwined in my past life fragments. I know myself. I will heal soon. To the right. Bring it forward a little bit. To the right. Your other right. Forward. [Backup signal beeping] What's the matter with you, bro? What's wrong with you? Forward, this way. Straight ahead. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Are you trying to fucking kill me right now? Hey! Get off my forklift before you hurt somebody! Millhouse, it's cool, man. It was just an accident. Hey, get your ass out of here. You're fired. You're firing me? Yeah. I'm firing you. Get out. You useless piece of shit. Tomorrow, your color will be the wrong color, and the streets where you retreat will be cold enough to preserve self-hate for months on end. Tomorrow, you will awake on the wrong side of the law, due to the corpse which materializes beside you in bed. Tomorrow, your wallet will be filled with meaningless slips of paper. Even the 7-Eleven will laugh. Tomorrow, the sun will not come out! Tomorrow, door locks will fail to recognize the bits of metal on your keychain. Tomorrow, the days will fall backwards into a rusty jingle. What the hell was that? It was a poem. Oh. I wanted to be cool in kindergarten. But the toys were so big, and I couldn't cherry-drop. My hair flew free and pigtails weren't my thing. Oh, I hate open mic night. Well, why don't you just listen to what she's saying? I hate open mic night! Puerile, dear boy. Puerile. And who are you to judge? Huh? At least she has the courage to get up there. That's more than I can say for you. Nobody wants to hear your shit from down here. Why don't you shut your fucking mouth, huh? Lovely way with words. I am so sick of your shit. You are a nothing. You are an old, bitter drunk. Vulgarian! [Grunts and groans] Chill out. Oh, my goodness. Hey! Chill out. You wait for me outside. You chill it. You all right, Benny? I started it. Clean this stuff up, man. Get him a drink on me. What the hell happened? What is it with you? You a tough guy now? Jake, you and I, we got the same love for poetry. Difference is, I can only feel it. I can't write it. I mean, it's not like I don't write. I write hundreds of poems, but they're just words. They don't bounce off each other and, uh, make magic. But you, you got it all. Heart, soul, talent. Even when your poetry sucks, there's something good about it. You don't appreciate this great gift that you have. You've got some some negative shit locked up inside of you. I put it down in words on paper, but it doesn't get it out. I just wish people could hear what I'm saying. Well, I'll tell you what. It ain't gonna never happen, pal, until you get that poison out of your system.

You write about everything in the world, but when you come face to face with a real problem, you run. You talk about humanity. You don't have a scrap of it. All you do is hide behind your words. Okay. I deserve that. You're right. One thing this virus teaches you is cut the bullshit. You know what? I don't have time for this. Marni. How did you get it? What does that matter? I had a brother. He died of aids, and... I'm not dying. I know you're not dying. I know you're not dying. It's just, you know, back there, you caught me off guard, and... Hey, you were a bastard. Just leave it at that. It was my fault, anyway, for mixing... Look, I still want to get you published. Are you interested? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'll work with you on one condition.

We need tape, and don't be a pain in the ass. Marc: Morning, ladies and gentlemen. All: Good morning. What's on the table for today? Well, I've been thinking about marni's poetry idea. I think we should be a presence at this year's poetron slam. I think we should offer a publishing deal to the winner with a $25,000 advance. Nobody offers that kind of money for a poetry slam. It's a write-off. Plus, we'll be getting the best poet's work. We can put paid readings and a spoken word cd release together. No. I don't see this happening. Marni? I think we have to do it. I got it. $25,000. You just have to win. Hey, forget the money. I just want another spoken word cd. And I asked Marc to be a judge in the finals. He doesn't know poetry, so he asked me to do it. Well, a little money definitely makes it interesting. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. At night, a man asleep turns to his... Take your hands out of your pockets. Keep your head up.

He chases it madly. He chases it madly. At night, a man asleep turns to his life. I think it's great. I'm not so sure about the middle. At night, a man asleep... Take your hands out of your pockets. [Sighs] At night, a man asleep... Look out to the audience. Let them see you. At night, a man asleep... Smile. At night, a man asleep turns to his life and tries to grab it. [Coughs] I'm fine. At night, a man... Use your hands. At night, a man asleep turns to his life and tries to grab it. [Groans] Marni? TV narrator: ...Much different from the jungle, where the chimps forage from the trees. Maybe Gabriel will let me stay at his place. Why don't you move in here? At least until you've found another job. I don't think that's a good idea. Narrator: Thousands and thousands of zebras... We're not going to be sleeping together. It's not that. Seriously, it's not that. It's just even my father could keep a roof over his head. Look, you're not like your father. You're an artist. You're living an artist's life. Besides, if you stay here, I can make sure that, uh, you're working. I can keep my eye on you. Narrator: Hundreds of animals drown yearly as... Oh, I get it. Sort of like slavery, huh?

Give this to David? Make sure he gets it. This is really important. Could you excuse me for one second, please? Marni. Can I talk to you? Hello, David. Listen. You know, I feel bad about what happened between US. I mean, I know I can be a bit overbearing at times, but I really miss you. David... You haven't forgotten, have you? The times we spent on the porch together? Dinner, just you, me, a bottle of wine? Yeah. We used to stay up all night, laughing and talking. I remember we used to be so surprised when the sun came up. That was sweet, when we first met. Those were the best moments of my life. I miss you. What if I come over later tonight? David, I'm sorry. You know, he's just using you. You used me, David, to get all this. [Subdued music over conversation] It's good. It's really good. Now, you got to strum that one. ♪ ♪ Hey. That wasn't too bad. You're amazing. Hey. Hey.

[Sniffing] This is the guy we've been looking for. He has got a world of talent, passion. He's got a heart the size of the ocean. People are going to go crazy over him. I'm talking books, cds, mtv, everything. That sounds great. What's going on, Marc? Uh...[sniffles] Listen, I've thought long and hard about how to say this, and it doesn't make it any easier for me. Marc, whatever it is, just spit it out. I just got fired. What? Alan told Marc I'm HIV-positive. Lisa overheard him. I told you what a hypochondriac he is. Probably had a brain hemorrhage when he found out. No, wait a minute. That's against the law. Like that matters? Well, we've gotta do something. Can't we go to the papers or the TV? And what? I go back to a job where people don't want me? Besides, I don't have any proof. This is bullshit. Jake, don't. Woman: Sir, you can't go in there! You Alan? Yeah. I know what happened with marni. Who are you? A friend of hers. I don't know what you're talking about. You got her fired because she has HIV. You can't prove that. Settles made me do it! He wanted to get back at her 'cause the two of you were together. [Panting] God, for a minute there, I thought you were gonna hit me. You were right. He's walking in right now, so... You can't lash out like that. I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you. I can take care of myself. So do something then. Sue them. Do you have any idea how long that would take? We need to get jobs now. Well, I think I just blew that. All right, there's plenty more people in the publishing business. They won't even see US. It's no big deal. You don't understand. I've lost my job. That means I've lost my health care. Hey, uh, you know, I can scrape some money together. I'm sure Gabriel will give me a job at the bar. I can work temp, but do you have any idea what my medicine costs? What happens if I end up in the hospital? We're in this together. You know what's gonna happen, don't you? I'm gonna wind up dying at county hospital. Don't even say that. I'll win the poetron slam. What? I'll win the slam. Yeah. That's a great plan. Oh, now you don't think I can do it? It's not that. It's just even if you win, 25,000 isn't going to last a lifetime. Well, it's a good start. It's a step in the right direction. Help me. Help me win. Please. I don't know. You're a good poet, but it's just so hard. It's... Are you okay? Where do we go from here? In the drawer, under the lamp. [Exhaling] Woman: Sometimes he starts with kisses. Sweet, sensuous kisses. A thousand kisses cover me. My face, neck, breasts, stomach, and then my thighs. He licks me, deliciously, softly, slowly, seducing me to scream. I'm crazy with desire, and I want him in me. He makes love like a man. He knows exactly what he wants, and he wants me completely. And I give myself to him again, and once again, and then again. Can't get enough. His thrusts are thrusts of strength and passion. Or...gasm. Still sleepy? No. I'm just thinking. I like this quilt. I've never seen anything like it before. It's an aztec design. Sacred quetzal bird. Oh, yeah? What were you thinking about? Ah. I was just thinking about my brother. I wish I could have known him. Yeah. He was a good guy. He always had something going on. When my parents found out he was... That he was gay, they... They immediately sent him to a psychiatrist. It's not their fault. They didn't know. Well, I gave up on finding someone. I knew David was wrong for me, but at least he understood. Can we not talk about that guy? You're a much better poet. Oh, yeah? Yeah. A better lover, too. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. [Blues music playing in bar] T.s. Eliot. It is t.S., isn't it? Give me a beer, t. Hey, Benny, why don't you quit drinking? Why don't you quit boring the shit out of me? You know why I drink? 'Cause it makes assholes like you more interesting. That's why I drink. [Chuckles] No, chill out. That's private, man. Let me see what he's writing. God. &quot;after the war, my father's hobby was photography. &quot;new fathers often become photographers, it seems. &quot;but he took pictures of many things besides me, &quot;as if he suddenly felt it all slipping away and he wanted to hold it forever.&quot; gosh, that's great. Gabe, you see this? Yeah. Yeah. But what you don't understand, youngster, is that my man, Benny, he was the greatest. He had a poem published in the new yorker. A major literary success at 19. He was supposed to be the next Allen Ginsberg. From the mouth of Ginsberg himself. Wow. So, uh, what happened to him? He felt he could never live up to that poem again, so he never published anything afterwards. Look at this one here. [Reading quietly] Benny, this is unbelievable. Give me that, you little twit. What? I-I just think it's really good. What the hell would you know? Christ sake, that dribble you write you call poetry? I can flatulate with more feeling. Oh, that's funny. [Laughing] Hey. Good news. You were accepted into the poetron slam. Really? Well, that's great. Come here. What about the beer? A rotten goddamn poet, Gabe, and he's a rotten goddamn bartender. A shitty bartender, but I'm in the, uh... I'm in the slam, Benny. The only slam you're gonna get is a goddamn slam dunk. Stop it. Gabe, check it out. I got in the poetron slam. Yeah, yeah, congratulations. Hey, uh, how about a break? From what? Come on. Get up. [Groans] Let's go, sleepy. No. Come on. It's time to step up training. I was at the catchword until 2:00. Okay, i'm going to give you a word. I want you to improvise a poem around the word. It's too early to play this game. This isn't a game, okay? The last round of the slam is improvisation. That's where winners are made. I'm not talking &quot;Roses are red.&quot; it should have all the same complexities of your regular poems. Metaphors, themes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Allegory, symbolism, I got it. That's right. Okay? And improv is settles' strong suit. Mmm. Ready? Okay. Um, something easy. Sunset. Okay, you have 10 seconds. Sunset. Okay, um... Hmm...sunset, sunset, sunset, sunset. Time's up. You couldn't come up with anything? Every greeting card has a poem about a sunset. That wasn't even 10 seconds, and why don't you give me something I can work with, you know? Like, uh, blood or kill. That's more my theme. You need to learn about focus. [Seagulls loudly crying] At night, a man asleep turns to his life and tries to grab it. [Jet engines] As always, it skips just out of his reach and laughs at him. He chases it madly, his feet heavy as unexploded bombs. [Traffic noise] Defiantly, his life dances before him. He wants to catch it, to run it through some complicated steps, to tango a foxtrot, perhaps a mazurka. He wants to love his life, but it will have nothing of that and only giggles at him, [siren] Rolling its hips at a distance. I think I lost hearing. This was good practice for you today. You know, poets will do anything to throw you off. Scream, blow whistles, stamp their feet, anything that's gonna shake you up. Well, I don't rattle easy. Yeah, you're the master of the chill. No, seriously, I'll be all right. You know, slams at this level, they aren't just about words, but psychological strength. I mean, they'll do anything to crack you, make you mispronounce your words. Judges will deduct points for that. Are you sure you're ready for this? Yeah. Can we go get something to eat? No. I'm beat. Are you sure? It would be nice to sit down, you know, have some food, glass of wine, relax before tomorrow. No. I don't feel so good. Yeah, you look kind of pale. Ohh. Marni? [Siren] Doctor, here's the chart. Dr. Peters? Absolutely. Okay. Yes. How's she doing? She has a fever of unknown origin, and, uh, her t-cell count is down. We've got her on fluids. She needs to rest. She has a pulmonary problem. Haven't you ever noticed her cough? Yeah. I won't know whether it's pneumonia till we get her labs back. Pneumonia? Does that mean now that she has... Aids? Let's wait for the labs to come back. It could be common flu, for all we know. Can I talk to her? Sure, but remember what I said. She needs to rest. How you doing? I'm good. Jake... I used to live with a guy. We used to do crystal meth, but I didn't know he used needles. By the time I found out, it was too late for me. You don't have to explain anything to me. I want you to know. I don't blame anyone else but myself for being HIV-positive. It doesn't matter. Marni, it doesn't matter. I'm here. I want to be here with you. I love you. You're still not very good with improvs. I'm gonna take a nap. Okay? Woman: The beauty comes from the difficulty, the complexity, the trap door ever giving way to other trap door, infinite capacity of life. It is amazing, and the fact that we survive it is amazing. And the fact that we suffer is beautiful, because we are suffering in jewels. We are glittering in the sun with all the decadent, superb richness of our life's experience dripping from our fingers and our wrists and the tips of our hair. And when we leave this world and walk into the opal light that we have come to think of as god, we will not go naked. We will go glittering. The poem list looks great. There's just something missing. Did you get what I asked for? I didn't like doing it. The slam material has to be original. Look, don't worry about that. It's not right. Great imagery. Who is this guy, anyway? He's a genius that looks and sounds like a pile of garbage. I buy some stuff from him every once in a while. You can win without it. I got a lot riding on tomorrow, and so do you. If I succeed, you succeed, so don't sweat it. What, all we need's a couple of mispronounced words? That's right. And I got a plan that's gonna take him down. He's gonna throw his poem list right out the window. It's going to be all right. What are you doing? I got up an hour ago. I took a shower to let you sleep. Come on. Let's get you home and out of those clothes. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You're sick. You can't just get up and walk out of the hospital. I'm not missing this for anything, okay? I awakened this morning. I was filled with despair. Darkness surrounded me. Death hung heavy on my shoulders. I saw no reason to live. And then, I remembered what today held. I saw a window of light, a reason to be. And now, I'm here. Welcome to the Los Angeles poetron slam! Today, the finest poets on the west coast will compete for a $25,000 cash prize, plus a paid series of readings, a spoken word cd contract, and a publishing deal by our wonderful sponsors, windsor house press, represented here today by Mr. Marc neihauser! [Applause] Welcome, Marc! And now, from out of the west, come the thundering hoofbeats of our first contestant. From the tumbleweed world of cowboy poetry, Fresno Pete! [Applause] Yee-ha! There's two things in life I really love. That's women and horses. This, I'm sure of. So when I die, you please tan my hide and tool me into a saddle so fine and give me to a cowgirl who likes to ride, so in the hereafter, I may rest between the two things I love the best. Woman: You tell 'em, cowboy! Longfellow: Thank you, Pete. There's a real man, who makes plans for sex even after death. Now, let's check in with our esteemed judges. [Applause] Good work, partner. And now, it's high noon. And here's a man who has a showdown with a cowboy poet, Jake Thompson! Man: Yeah! Let's see what you got, poetry boy. &quot;how many fights have you been in?&quot; She asks, holding my hand, running a painted fingernail around big, angry knuckles, rubbing faint, pink scars, as if to make a wish. Spreading fingers wide, I show her my digits, all twisted and bent with the force of impact! Man: Yeah! &quot;just one,&quot; I say to her, &quot;and I'm getting my ass kicked.&quot; [applause] Least I lost to something I understand. All right, man. Take care. That felt so good. I can't believe it. They're not all going to be that easy, okay? You have to keep your level up. I want you to look at the judges. Are you okay? I'm fine. Don't worry about me. Worry about the competition. Next up is a man who never rides sidesaddle, chrome Harley. Woman: Yeah, baby! Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! You're ready to move! Scour oily hand, comb hair smooth. Pull out all 8 glistening feet of hand-polished heaven reflection, petted to perfection. Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! The power to part traffic like a modernized Moses. Other drivers know a monster-style machine when they see one. [Applause] They say in the flattest part of north Dakota on a starless, moonless night, no breath of wind, a man can light a candle and walk away. And every now and then, he can turn and see the candle burning. 17 miles later, provided the conditions remained ideal, he could still see the flame. Somewhere between the 17th and 18th mile, he would lose sight of the flame. If he were walking backwards, he would know the exact moment he lost it. He could take a step forward and find it again. Back and forth, dark to light, light to dark. What is this place where the light disappears? Where it reappears? Don't tell me about eyeballs and photons, reflection, refraction. Don't tell me about 186,000 miles per second, the theory of relativity. Because all I know is that place where the light appears and disappears, that's the place where we live. [Applause] Yes!

David settles is our first finalist. Take the sucker to the hoop, magic Johnson. Re-create. Reverse. Hoodoo jams off the spin. Woman: Tell it! Alley-oop, dunk-a-thon, magician passes. Now double pump, scissor fan through space, hang in place, and put it all in the sucker's face. Woman: Tell it! Magic Johnson! Aow! Now, deal the Rambo like the juju man that you am. [Applause] Let me be the man who, walking among tall trees, is struck by lightning, but is not killed, fizzing with burnt hair, and lands on his feet, shoes smoking, and shakes his head, saying, &quot;jesus, that smarts!&quot; let me be the man who walks away from shipwrecks. In a leveled city, let me be found 17 days later, under a former insurance building, sucking air through the plumbing, saying, &quot;i never really thought about giving up.&quot; [laughter] From all disasters, let me rise holy. On my face, let me have beautiful dueling scars. [Applause] Woman: You got it! [Audience boos] Are you kidding me? Jake Thompson is in the finals with David settles, mano-a-mano. Means hand-to-hand, dear. Let's take a short break before we continue. Yay! My man. What's up, man? Give it up. I need some water. Baby, are you okay? You're looking a little pale. Don't worry about me, okay? Think about what you have to do next. Thank you. Lisa, can you do me a favor and please keep an eye on her? I'm okay. I'm fine. You're burning up. She's fine. She's a champ. She's fine. We got her, pal. I'm fine. Okay? Go do what you have to do. Okay? Ladies and gentlemen, the poetron slam finals will feature Jake Thompson... [Cheering] Against last year's champion back again to defend his title, David settles! [Loud cheering] Now, the final competition will consist of four readings apiece. We're going to flip a coin to decide who goes first. The reigning champ will make the call. Heads. Tails it is. I'll go second. The challenger has chosen to go second. To my right are the judges for the finals. [Applause and cheering] I see Mr. Neihauser has successfully retrieved his coin. Invest it wisely. May I suggest short-term cds. Seriously. Are you ready? Then let the slam begin! [Cheering] After the war, my father's hobby was photography. New fathers often become photographers, it seems. But he took pictures of many things besides me, as if he suddenly felt it all slipping away, and he wanted to hold onto it forever. In one of the many shoeboxes filled with photographs at my father's house, one photo sticks in my mind. It's a snapshot of a black hat in mid-air. Where are you going? The kind of hat fashionable in the forties. A fedora, something bogie would wear. So, what's going on? Does that sound familiar to you? That's the poem from Benny's journal. Benny? No, don't start any shit. I don't want any trouble. Benny, he stole your poem. Those are your words. You should be the one out there doing it. I'm shy. Gabe? Unbelievable. David: Someone has thrown it into the air. Here, take this. I'm going off book. Don't do it, okay? He wants you to do that. Stick with our plan. At odd moments of my life, that hat appears to me... For no discernible reason. [Applause and cheering] Woman: Go, David! The plagiarist. I stole a poem. Shh! Oh, I had to. It was so good. I heard it at an open reading, and I had to make it mine. The poet was a bum, anyways. He wouldn't have done anything with it, not like I would have. It was a great poem. It could make my name as a poet. It could make me rich. It could change the world, and I would get all the credit. I sold the poem to a magazine. I got two free copies. [Clicks tongue] [Laughter and applause] What does defeat smell like? Audience: Ohh! Stale beer breath after another frustrating night at the open mic? Man: Get him! You see, nobody ever admits to choosing a dead-end lifestyle, because there's always a good excuse for being a victim. Man: That's pretty cold. The angry poet is a cliche for a good reason, and it's so much easier than being responsible. Consider this. A loser is still a loser, no matter how loud, angry, or justified. How true is it the view from second place never changes? What does defeat smell like? Man: Yeah! Well, unless you're the lead dog, it is strong, indeed. [Applause and cheering] Man: It's on now! Marni: Jake. Jake, come here. Go back to your poem list. No. I can handle this clown. He's drawing you into a fight. I told you, I am off book. Jam, ram, and cram! It's poetry feeding time, and the big corporate lizards, all covered with shareholders and party favors, hunker down with the small mammals who strut their stuff in hopes of being eaten. Woman: That's right! Of being the next big splash at the water hole. Man: Whoo! It is an a-vomitation! And an insult to good food, I say, leafing through magazines with titles like cook me twice, feel me, fax me, facelift me, kiss my software, fat-free. What do I do when I see a poet entrepreneur, throwing bread crumbs, surrounded by greedy pigeons? Do I keep them? Eat them? Or set them free? [Bang] [Applause and cheering] What? [Audience booing] The quilt. There's a quetzal bird on it, an aztec warrior, a field of maize. There's yarn in it as blue as the sky, as auburn as her hair, as maroon as her nipples. How many times have we made love under the quilt? How many times we just couldn't wait, tearing like sharks at each other? The quilt has seen me draw blood from her neck, her arms, her inner thighs, her feet hoisted around my ears. The quilt has seen her suck on me like salvation. The quilt has heard every permutation of our grunts, gasps, screams, groans, and sighs. It has felt our bodies bounce, thrash, quiver, then subside. It has seen me bend her over her desk, in the bathtub, up against the wall, so hard that we made a picture of Kurt cobain fall down on her head. It has heard her ask me, &quot;am I sick? &quot;all I want to do is screw. I want to be your slut,&quot; She said, spread-eagle on the quilt. &quot;i want to be your ho, your tramp, your bitch.&quot; I feel sick. Here, sit down. You're okay. You're okay. Well, she has a new master today, a yapping cross between a pug and pekingese, infesting her quilt with ticks and fleas. But every time I call her name... [Whistles &quot;Here&quot;] [Clicks tongue] She still comes. [Applause and cheering] Reading animal sex ads. First personal: &quot;amoeba with a hard-on, sweetly headed your way.&quot; [laughter] Whoa! What? Too personal? Well, how about, uh, &quot;Tom t. Cat, &quot;furry kiss and tell, &quot;all flipped and gritty... Swinging from doors in a tomcat sex motel.&quot; mm. And ad number three says, &quot;monkey trapeze artist, &quot;swinging through your genitals like they was breadfruit &quot;and banana trees. You know, naturalism is a way of life.&quot; [laughter] Monkey kitty! What's goin' on, huh? What? Cat got your tongue? Or could it be you are... Not well hung? And maybe all of this is like, you know, well, uh, overcompensation? Anybody got a microscope? These ads don't excite my animal nature, so I will sit and... Woman: Go! Man: Come on. And turn out the lights... And stay there... Until love comes to me... Like a beautiful beast that sees in the dark. That's the mistake David was looking for. [Scoffs] [Applause and cheering] At the end of the third round, the score is Jake Thompson, 119.6, David settles, 123.3. Quite close. The final round of poetry is improvisation. Let's see if their minds are as fast as their mouths. [Whispering] Jake. She's really getting sick. It's bad. Let's get her to the hospital, huh? Leave me alone. No. You're down by four, okay? You need to put up big points to win. Baby, I am worried about you. We are getting out of here. Remember what you have to do. Keep it short and sweet. Baby, look at you. I can't. 10 seconds is even longer than that. Think association. Search your heart for the poem. In this final round of improvisation, each poet will receive a word that I pull out of my... Hat. [Laughter] Using that word, they have 10 seconds to begin the poem. If either poet fails to begin the poem within 10 seconds, they forfeit that round. Mr. Settles... Your word is &quot;Coral&quot;. Coral. I don't want just a screw. I want deeper in, infect her with myself. Grow like a live coral under a flap of skin. I want to deform her, swell her belly, ruin her in the eyes of other men. I want to confirm her suspicions. I am infectious, precaution-less, virile, masculine. [Applause and cheers] Man: Oh, yeah! Let's see the judges' scores. 7.8. 7.5. 7.4 7.7 and 7.5. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the highest combined score ever given for an improvisation at the Los Angeles poetron slam. [Applause] And the total score for David settles is 161.2, a marvelous score. Mr. Thompson... Your word is &quot;Laughter.&quot; laughter, Mr. Thompson. You have 10 seconds. She laughs in her sleep. Next to her, I wrestle with the covers I made, but... Cannot sleep in... When I am seized by a noise, loud by itself, but barely more than a breath... Like a hiccup licking a gasp. Laughter. She laughs in her sleep... As the moon and stars conspire to transform tears of the day before... Into silver laughter... As if, together, they share some secret joke... For all those willing to simply relax and listen. And while I'm distracted by my lover's laughter, the stealthy moon creeps across the room... And kisses me to sleep. This is the first time I have ever forgotten my name. [Applause and cheering] All right, let's check the judges' scores. 7.4. [Audience muttering and booing] This is a joke. Let's get out of here. Wait a minute. Longfellow: 8.2 8.2 [applause growing louder] 8.4. And 9.1, for a new combined improvisational record of 41.3, for a total of 160.9 that's great. Not quite great enough. David settles is the winner of the Los Angeles poetron slam! That's bullshit. Come on, we're going. Here's the money. David, come on over and collect your $25,000. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. [Cameras clicking] Traces of me. Lipstick marks on a letter I sent. Credit card receipts. What's left after a day? After a life? What if I'm just a child's chalk drawing in the street? What happens if it rains? I found you when I fell through the cracks in the sidewalk. How much time I've got for me means just how much time I've got to be with you. Now, with you, I want to be outfitted for life. But it might just be summer wear. Maybe I'm only a butterfly, like it or not. Please find my letter in the folds of my wings. [Light applause] You did great. I feel great. That was great. You're not a poetry virgin anymore. I know. Thank you. That was excellent. This calls for a drink, no? Yes. Marc: Ahem. Marni. Marc. I need you to come back to work. I've still got the virus. I know, I know. And I'm sorry. I-I-I thought about it a lot, and I reacted very badly. I got my own hang-ups. I mean... We can work together. We always have. She needs health care. Health care, back pay, whatever it takes. Let's talk on Monday. Deal. Deal. You were terrific at the slam. Did you see his bow tie? Stop. All right! All right! Listen up! The moment you've been waiting for has come! The winner of tonight's slam is... Our own Benny! Ohh! [Applause] [Feedback] Hey. Well, the best poet always loses. Mm-mmm. Not anymore. And then they were married. They had one child, a healthy, lanky, dark-haired boy. They lived in a green house with a yard, and the next-door neighbor made rhubarb pies. One year, they went to France and visited the grave of rimbaud. A young couple laughed at them. Is that enough?
