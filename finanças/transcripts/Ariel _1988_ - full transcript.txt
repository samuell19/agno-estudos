MINE CLOSED NO ENTRY No point trying to win your bread around here anymore. Don't stay here to piss around, won't do you a shit's worth of good. You'll drink yourself silly and just get frustrated. Take the car keys, it's yours now. You've always liked it better than the others. They are no good anyway, if they won't stay here - they'll go down South and hang themselves there. I've had it with this shit - but don't do what I do. This is shit, too. - How much? - All of it. 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79... - That's 8.000. - Thanks. Sighing low, the evening comes Lights come on behind the windows No-one else stays behind in the dark As the lights drive away the shadows of the night I don't turn the lights on I don't think I need them now You're my brightest light Too bright, I'd say Hamburger. Great set of wheels. Yeah. What sort of mill? - Mill? - The engine. I don't know. Open the hood, let's check it out. As drivers: Salminen, Niskanen - Mattila, T?llstr?m, Pesonen - Laine, Markkula - Jokinen, V?is?nen. And a couple more. You, you, and you. You. - Name? - Kasurinen, Taisto. 256 marks. Whose is this? I found it on the trash can. It's Makkonen's, he got run over by a forklift. Keep it. Thanks. Where do I sign? Nowhere. - We borrowed your radio. - That's OK. Do you know where I could spend the night? - I do. - Where? - Give us a lift? - Sure. - Got any room here? - Bed or mattress? - What's the difference? - Bed's 30 marks a night. A mattress is a bit less as you get no sheets. A bed. Hello. Gimme the funny pages. Here. Make up your mind, I must go. Good afternoon. Sorry. - Who do I complain to? - To me, personally. Is there anything I can do? - A dinner wouldn't do any harm. - Let's go. Not while I'm on duty. I'll have to quit. It was a ridiculous cap anyway. Thanks for the evening, my first in a convertible. - The roof doesn't work. - I know. - It's dark, want to come up? - If it's not too much trouble. - I've got only coffee. - Coffee's fine. I'm divorced. - Don't let it get you down. - I've got a kid, too. Even better. We save time, raising a family. - Always so self-confident? - This is the first time. - Just don't make any noise. - No-one will notice. Hmm. I hope I won't regret this. - Irmeli. - Taisto. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. - I think we've met somewhere. - I saw you once in a bar. Do your friends call you Tasi? - I've got no friends. - Everybody has. - I'm from the countryside. - That's different. You're getting the picture. - Was your husband a drunk? - No, he found someone else. - Where? - I don't remember. The whole thing was a mistake. I hated him from the start. - That's odd. - That's what you think. Will you disappear in the morning? - No, we'll be together forever. - Good. I must go to work early. Good night. Coffee. - Toast or crispbread? - Crispbread. It's broken. Mother told you to call her. Aren't you going to work? I can't come yet. Come and see me here, at four. Bye. Found anything? No. I'll work at the docks if there's anything. - See you tonight? - No, I'm working. - Where? - Bank of Finland, as a night watchman. I need the money. The whole apartment is furnished on instalments. - Do you still have a lot to pay? - I'll be okay in a couple of years. Nice wind. I lost my dreams, everything in my life I lost my dreams because of you Now I'm lost in my dreams, I hide from the world I look out of the window, see the rain come down I miss you, my love... - Kasurinen. - What? You owe us for four nights. I know, I haven't got any money. Go and get some. How much do you want for it? At least 20 thousand. Six and a half. That's all? Nobody'd give any more for a heap this old. Alright then. Leave the car here, you'll get the money in the morning. Okay. This court has sentenced Kasurinen as follows: For crimes of assault and attempted robbery - possession of an offensive weapon and resisting arrest - all combined, one year and 11 months inprisonment.

No money. Belt and shirt. Mikkonen. Good night. What were those? Sedatives. What for? Ask me again in a year. What do you do, normally? What do you mean normally? I've always been here. What will you do when you get out? Kasurinen. A visitor for you. - Hi, Tasi. - Hi. - How are you, Tasi? - All right. I've got a job. - Go and play somewhere. - Where? In the hallway. - Will you marry me? - Here? - No, on the outside. - All right, but how? You take care of the paperwork, I'll come when I can. You won't. Listen, Mikkonen. I don't think I can help it. I'm thinking of getting out of here soon. I see. How? Don't know yet. Somehow. Getting out is no big deal, many people've made it. But they've been brought back - and ended up doing twice as much time as before. They've stayed here or gone to Sweden. Or headed to the nearest bar and got loaded. You've got to go further away. Italy or Africa, first at least. I've been thinking about Mexico or Brazil. Even better. But that costs money. You think I haven't planned it all a hundred times? First you need three grand for a passport - and ten more for the seamen to hide you in the cargo - and to put you off somewhere around the equator. But it's dangerous. If the cargo begins to shift in a storm... Many've died that way. You must go underground - until you get a passport and find the right ship. How many years do you have left? Eight, for manslaughter. - But I'm innocent. - Are you? At least in God's eyes. In a way I did kill him, but the truth is I didn't. The result was the same: He died, and I was sent here. All right, let's go then. I am 37 now - and 8 more makes me about 43. Then I won't last 3 hours outside without killing somebody. Kasurinen! - What? - You can take the floor-map with you to bed tonight. - Why? - You can pretend it's your wedding night. Kasurinen, Taisto. You cannot see him now, he's in solitary. - Why? - For violent behaviour. He's not violent. The warden whose jaw he broke disagrees. - It was somebody else. - Come back on Sunday. He'll be taken to his cell tonight if he's calmed down. It's his birthday, would you take these to him? Happy birthday. I didn't want to begin alone. Age has given me a sweet tooth. But nobody sends me anything, it's my own fault. When other boys had their eyes on girls, I sat in Juvenile prison - for having taken an old lame granny's sledge. - Mikkonen. - Shoot. This isn't my birthday, it's sometime in the winter. The deal's off. - You can't do that! - Why not? I hear the bitter laughter echo in the darkness Tonight I won't accuse you of anything Because for you I would walk through a desert haze On this autumn night my mind is blue Tonight no stars shine to comfort me I guess it's useless to hope for anything Best to drown myself in the night Where's the other witness? - There isn't another. - I'll get someone. In front of these witnesses I ask you Irmeli Pihlaja - do you take Taisto Kasurinen as your lawful wedded husband - in sickness and in health? I do. You having both answered yes to my questions - I pronounce you man and wife. What? Dad, the cops are coming. Four thousand, each. That's a lot. There's not much competition. All right. How are you going to get the money? Don't you worry about that. We could help you. All right. Fix us a car and a gun. What's our cut? The passports are part of the deal. A quarter, regardless of the take. Half. And you can sleep here before and after the job. - And if we get nothing? - Every business has its risks. - When are the passports ready? - In the morning. All right. Half. We need a car in the morning. Give me the gun. Let's go. - How much did we get? - Enough. I'll get the passports, you wait here. - Why? - I don't trust them. How did it go? Where's the passports? - The car was fucked. - I know. You couldn't get it in reverse. - Let's split the take now. - I think we'll take it all. You're a risk to me, if you get caught you may start to sing. The other one's still outside. Go and get him. Mikkonen... Take the money and run. I have to go and I can't take you with me. You must be a brave boy and wait here for my call. Meanwhile you can pack your little suitcase. Put in it everything you want to take with you. We're going abroad. - Irmeli. - What? Be sure to call me. - We have to get him to hospital. - I know. Stop. The ship's called Ariel. Tonight at ten o'clock, off Hernesaari Point. Bury my heart at the dump. What's this button for? Hello. I understand. Bye. Here's a package for you. Over here. - Where's Mikkonen? - He won't be coming. - But we are three. - I'd like to see the money. All right. Let's go. - Where's the Ariel headed? - Mexico. Didn't you know? Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true Subtitles: Mikko Lyytik?inen Broadcast Text
