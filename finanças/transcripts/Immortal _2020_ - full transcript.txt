The I Ching or Book of Changes is a millenary text dating back 1100 years before our time. Composed of a series of hexagrams that interpret the energy of the consultant, that of nature and the cosmos. These 3 energies together reveal what you want know of the future. Before travelling to Buenos Aires, Ana Lauzer consulted the I Ching. The 6 lines of her hexagram were 31 Hsien. Above Tui, below Ken. Weakness above, strength below. Two parallel universes with forces that attract, influence, feed and need each other, until they are inevitably joined. ‘A nonexistent place The singing of birds An immobile trip towards the infinite.’ Entry 502 Monday, August 10th 8.30 am After days of walking in the dessert without finding a water hole, the Bedouins begin to see mirages regularly their thirst grows and so do their hallucinations. They call this the death zone. Leteo has become my death zone. I can’t keep going in. I need to find someone to replace me. water hole the Bedouins begin to see mirages regularly their thirst grows and so do their hallucinations. They call this the death zone. Leteo has become my death zone. I can’t keep going… I need to find someone to replace me. IMMORTAL Good morning. Good morning. Welcome. I have a reservation for Ana Lauzer. We were waiting for you. Please fill in the register. You’ve come from Rome. I’d like to be in Rome right now. So would I. Don’t you like Buenos Aires? I’ve come on business. Second floor. If there's anything you may need. Thank you. Amico! Welcome Anita! Hi. How are you? Fine and you? Nice to see you. Yes, isn’t it. How long has it been? Too long. Good morning. What will you have? A coffee. The last time was in Rome. You were with that girl. Are you still together? No, don’t even mention her. We quarrelled before landing at Ezeiza. Just imagine. And you? No, just work. Well then, I see you brought the papers I asked for. Yes. I want to sign whatever I need to sign. I’m only staying 10 days. I get back to Rome and have another trip. I’ve got a lot of work. The adventurous life of a photographer. Why not photograph furniture for design magazines? Or muscly guys for advertising? There are loads around. It’s better than being in in Africa, where they’re shooting people. No, I’ve never been to Africa. Africa or where ever, it’s all the same. Look at me, always at my office or in Court. I envy you, to be honest. Let’s see. I’m missing the deed to the property you mentioned, the apartment. It’s a two-storey house where the printers was. Sara, must have the deed. Could you ask her for it? Would you do me that favour? I don’t have much time and every time I go, she chats for hours. I’ll ask her for it. Thanks. Yeah. Good luck when you go. Photos, letters. You clearly made an effort to find these papers. Sorry. I brought everything I had. I had no time. I can see that. Look at your dad. I took that picture. It was the last time I was in Buenos Aires. Where were you when your dad died? In Uzbekistan. It was very far. And in better shape. Stop smoking and start enjoying life. You’re listening to Avellaneda Republic radio. FM 96.3. The world across the river. 10.30 am, 15.2 degrees C in Buenos Aires and now we move to the city of La Plata where there’s a big teacher’s march. ‘We’re here because the Governor won’t listen. ‘The raise they offer is an embarrassment. They’re ruining the country and starving teachers.’ ‘This project discriminates and raises inequality. Hunger and humiliation are not the consequences, they’re the objectives. Many families support the teachers’ claim. ‘Thankfully we have a lot of support, and awareness that we must all unite to defend education. There were 70.000 people here today and we’ll go on as long as necessary. We refuse to pay with our salaries for President Macri’s ferocious policies.’ That was Pedro Lopez, primary school teacher at the protests in La Plata. Now time for music on Radio Republic… Stop please. Stop! Asshole! I’m doing yoga now. The teacher’s great. She bends this way and that. She’s like rubber. Look at me. I can touch my ankles, look. I go like this and then… Ok, please, I believe you. That’s not necessary. Oh well. Then I tried a creative writing workshop, English classes, The course with the Japanese woman. What Japanese woman? The Japanese woman teaches you how to fold your clothes, to fix your house, to throw out anything you don’t need. But I like yoga best. There are people my age there, someone to chat to. You know me, I like to chat. Your dad does… used to exercise. Did he do yoga? No, he went for walks. He’d say: ‘I go on a walk without knowing where to, no place in mind, but I always end up in my old neighbourhood. I brought you a present. What? Thank you, Ana. Let's have a look. Oh, it’s beautiful. Italian silk. Yes. It’s lovely, thank you. You like it? Yes very much. It’s truly lovely. He wanted me to take charge of the printing company. Parents are like that. What can you do! He was angry with me. Why? He didn’t say so but I could tell. I don’t know. Maybe he needed help. I was angry with him too. A bit. I think he could have helped me a bit more. Instead of giving his money to that lunatic. That friend, the one who left him bankrupt. What friend? No one left him bankrupt. He did it of his own accord. No, it was that guy’s fault. Julian or Julio Benedetti. I must confess, sometimes I talk to him as if he was here. Something similar happened to me today. I was on the bus and I thought I saw dad, through the window. The spitting image of him. Exact! I hadn’t realized I was close to the printers. I was in Avellaneda. My subconscious played a trick on me. You saw him. How was he? It was another man. Someone who looked like him. But that someone, how was he? It was just a second, I don’t know. And then? I lost sight of him. How? He vanished in thin air? No, I followed him and then I lost him. I didn’t want to scare you. It’s getting late. I’m meeting someone. Can you give me the deed? Yes. Yes, of course. Excuse me. I have to speak to the woman who just went in. You can’t go in unless you have an appointment. I have an appointment. With whom? With Dr. Benedetti. Hello Dr... reception calling. There’s someone here who says she has an appointment with you. Name? Ana Lauzer. Ana Lauzer, sir. Yes, sir. Fine, sir. Third floor. The lift is out of order. Don’t touch the door, it has electricity. Go up the stairs. Hello Ana! How nice to see you. Come on in. Come in. Your dad always spoke of you. Of your photography. He was so proud of you. Come in, come in. Make yourself comfortable. Here… Sit down, I’ll make you some coffee. No, there’s no coffee. I don’t want any. I saw my father’s wife come into the building and I tried to catch up with her. Oh Sara, I haven’t seen her for ages. Your dad and I always tried to keep her out of our conversations. We’d escape and go to the bar opposite the printers and have cocktails made for us... If Sara came into the building must be to talk to you. To me? No, no. Do you see her with me? Think I’m hiding her? Look Mr. Benedetti, I know you ruined my dad. The Printing Company was his life and he lost it all. All except… the depts. That’s not how things happened. Isn’t it? Allow me to explain. How did it happen? What do you want from Sara? You want her to finance your experiments? Sara was very worried after talking to you. How do you know I spoke to her? She called me last night, crying. Why? Something I said? Because you saw your dad. No I didn’t see my dad. I saw someone who looked like him. Someone who looked like him. I wish… I don’t understand. I wish we could go back to the same old places, like your dad did. To the same park, the same neighbourhood, the same bar. We can’t here and now. But there is a place you can go back to. Come with me. I’ll show you something. Come with me. Come in, don’t be afraid. What happened to Jose was a misfortune. But he’s where he wants to be now. Have you ever heard of Shrödinger’s cat? No. Erwin Schrödinger was an Austrian physicist. In 1935 he imagined this situation. A scientist puts a cat in a closed box. A ‘blind box’ but the cat isn’t alone. There’s a gadget in there with the cat that can let out a poisonous substance. After a period of time there’s a 50% chance that the poison is let out and the cat dies and another 50% chance that it won’t happen. We don’t know because the box is closed. Why don’t you open it? Good question. That is exactly what this is all about. What happens when the box is closed. It's something like Quantum Mechanics. An electron can be in two places simultaneously, while we observe it. while the cat's box is closed, the cat lives and dies all at once. As long as the box is left closed. That’s how I built a world where the dead can live. Ok then… It seems to be all here. Fine. I’ll photocopy them and give them back to you. OK. You ok? Yeah. Listen do want me to arrange a dinner, or a get together with our old classmates? No, I’ve lost touch with them. I haven’t seen them for ages. As you wish. You seem worried. Is it all this business? No. It’s Sara. I think she’s being swindled. How? A friend of my dad’s who’s connected to the private cemetery business. It’s very strange. I don’t know how to explain, they don’t offer exclusive lots, they offer trips to the Great Beyond. It’s a swindle. Look Ana, I handle Sara’s affairs. It’s alright. If she wants to get rid of the house, I’ll find out. She’s also got a small apartment close to Tribunales. I know she reads about angels, the Chinese horoscope, the runes and all that… but she’s not crazy. Relax. Can I take your picture? Go ahead. Yes? Who? Tell her I’ll be right down. Benedetti told you I was coming, didn’t he? I’m Isa Dora. How many stars does this hotel have? ½? You’re Benedetti’s partner. Isadora, like the ballerina. I don’t think my parents were interested in ballet. It’s actually Isabel Dora. I’m an engineer and I’m in charge of the company. We’re not partners. Benedetti is our advisor. You’re an executive and he’s an employee? Something like that. You can call me by my first name. Can I have a glass of water? I travelled to Leteo today. It makes you thirsty. You’ve come from the land of the dead. It’s not the land of the dead. It’s a dimension parallel to ours where images of real life are preserved. It’s like a photo album but a living one. I don’t know if Benedetti explained it. The experiment of the trapped cat. I’d be as doubtful as you if it weren’t for the fact I travel there a lot. The doctor is particularly interested in you going. I’m not. He wants to prove to you that your father didn’t waste his money on the hallucinations of a lunatic. My father was naïve, I’m not. I won’t pay a cent. No cameras. It’s forbidden to take photographs. Don’t you like it? Photographer’s phobia. Don’t you look nice! Give me that. Tell you what. I’ll let you travel for free just this once. Your swindling tactics are more elaborate than I imagined. We could do with testing the effect the travelling has on people’s health. It doesn’t affect me much. But… the travelling’s nearly killed Benedetti, poor man. Tell me the truth. What do you do with those who travel? Do you drug them and make them have hallucinations? When your father escaped and you saw him in the street, were you on drugs? Just give the doorman your named and tell him you’re going to use the lift. You’ll get the code via mail. They’re 4 digits like an ATM machine. We change the number every day. Pay no attention to the sign that says it doesn’t work. It does. Mariano, it’s Ana. I’m going to see Benedetti. The guy from the cemeteries. The friend of my dad’s I mentioned. I don’t think there’s any danger but I wanted to let you know just in case. If you don’t hear from me. Sara knows where I am. Bye. Good morning. Good morning. I’ve come to take the lift. Your name? Ana Lauzer. You’ll have to leave your things here. OUT OF ORDER You haven’t… No! I came to visit you. I saw you in the street the other day. How is it possible? Where were you going? At first I was happy here in Leteo. But now all I want is to go back. The traffic, the hooting horns, the crowds, everything I hated, now they seem like Heaven. If they see you with that camera they take it away. Who’ll take it away? There’s no one from the company here, or is there? No they’re all residents here. Miss… Aren’t you forgetting something? Everyone comes out like that the first time. Like zombies… and very thirsty. Entry 524. Thursday, August 13th. 6 pm. The plan is working out as scheduled. She’s young and strong. She has the energy to survive in Leteo. Today she hates me but some day she'll understand. It was real wasn’t it? Ana, I know you travelled that you went to Leteo, Benedetti told me. Was it real for you or was it a hallucination? It’s real. I knew it couldn’t be a dream. Did he tell you we were together? It was lovely. I’m going to Leteo too, you know. What? Yes, I’ve handed over my properties to the company so I can get in. What are you saying? They have a lot of expenses, Ana. They have to keep a world running. It’s not about keeping a world running. What’s the matter? What are you going to live on? Do you think dad’s happy there? - He’s not happy because… - Get it out of your head. You’re not doing it. When I go he’ll be very happy. I’m going to talk to Mariano. There must be some way… I don’t want you to lose the house. Mariano was the one to convince me. What? Yes, he was the one to bring it up. I need to ask you a few questions. What questions? It’s a routine test we give anyone who travels to Leteo. 20 questions. Make yourself comfortable. Mariano… You called. Yes, I called. What's up? I can’t talk now I’ll call you back. OK. Told you it was all true. What do you want to ask? It’s a routine test. Let’s skip the first few questions. Name, occupation, address, marital status… sexual preference. Let’s focus on the physical aspect. I felt tired. Did you feel it in the same way being alone as relating to residents? When you interact the fatigue increases. With any resident in particular? With my dad. I saw others in the cafe. Yeah. They have a world to explore and we can’t get them away from those 4 tables. You saw a man with a sort of telescope. No. In a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate your weakness? An 8. Do you have any cramps? A spasm. A tickle I don’t know how to describe it. Here? Tension in the neck and an intermittent pain in your temple? We’re all disturbed and unstable due to Leteo. I’d like to show you the lab. I’ll see you tomorrow. What is this? It’s the heart of the miracle. This allows Leteo to exist. Don’t touch it. The sphere allows both worlds, that of the living and the dead to co-exist. Madam Engineer… Ana, how are you? How did it go? - OK? - Fine. Anything to tell? Any sensation, collateral effect? I was a bit weak when I came out. Yes, of course. And thirst? I was very thirsty. Oh yes… That’s normal. I didn’t deceive you then. I’m not a mad scientist. You’re not, Benedetti. You are a mad scientist Benedetti, It’s just that this time your madness worked. What’s that? It’s the signal that a client has just died. Another inhabitant for Leteo. Now it’s stable. Yes, but there are too many fluctuations. The disturbances generate the irregularities. Before the values were more constant. Ana… my condolences. Why? Sara, your father’s widow is the one who died. However, we can’t take her in under these conditions. I’m so sorry, Ana. What are you doing here? What a tragedy. It was an overdose with sleeping pills. The cleaning lady found her. She told me she was smiling. She knew she was going to a better place. A doctor from the company signed the death certificate stating a heart attack otherwise… we’d have an autopsy, endless paper work. Now it’s all done. What’s that? What are you taking? The house belongs to the company now. She left it to them. So, I’m taking the papers I need to put things in order. Why didn’t you tell me before? Come on, Anita be more understanding. She knew exactly what she was doing. It’s what she wanted, her decision. You must understand I’m fulfilling Sara’s wishes and your dad’s. What do you know about my dad? What do you know? He’d never have asked you to do something like that. He was involved with the program from the start. I got in through him. I can speak to Isa Dora if you like and get you to join too. Come and see me. I need your signature to proceed with the inheritance. Ok? I’ll see you tomorrow at my office. I’m Ana… And you? Victor. Who have you come to see? I’m looking for my dad, José. Lauzer. I see. Do you know him? Yes, of course. The one who escaped and wants to leave all the time. Where you’re looking at now we’re going to build 3 new buildings And further back, excuse me… Have a look. You’ll see a building we’re about to finish. See it? Doesn’t it work? No. None of them work. Thing is, it’s not a car, it’s the illusion of one. It’s still all in construction We need time to get things to work. They’re going to add more trees, rivers, birds. I thought I heard birds. Yes, you can hear birds but the birds aren’t there. It’s like Leteo’s soundtrack. At some point the cars will work and we’ll be able to travel. Do you like driving? I like speed. I’m here due to speed. It was April 17th I remember because it’s my birthday. I was running late to get to the party. I was on the highway on my motorbike. It had rained, the ground was wet. I thought you were from the company. No. I’m a resident. A resident? Yes, like your dad. Here it’s frowned upon to use words deriving from death. That’s why we’re called residents. There’s nothing strange, I’m simply dead. Wouldn’t you like to escape? Us residents don’t last long in world of the living. 3 hours at most. Calm down, don’t be frightened. Contact with residents weakens the living. That’s one of the symptoms. We become weak in the real world and you do in Leteo. What do you do for a living? Me? I’m a photographer. Yes. I’d like to take your picture. May I? Yes, of course. Victor, highway accident April 17th Motorcyclist killed in a fatal accident on the highway… Video: Accident and fire on Highway 5… 3 people died in highway accident. Accident – Republic Newspaper Victor, accident, highway April 17th, rain. Serious motorcycle accident. A young motorcyclist suffered serious injuries at dawn today… The victim, an engineer, Victor Benedetti… …was left in a coma. Everything’s fine. I’ve stabilized him and put him on oxygen. His pressure’s fine. That’s about it. If there’s anything else you need. I’ll stay with him a bit. You can go get some air. Of course. If you need anything let me know. Yes, I’ll call you. Hello son. I’m out of breath from those stairs. I brought something to read to you. I found a great paragraph, listen. Death or any mention of it Makes men precious and pathetic, Makes them what they were in their ghostly state. Each act they carry out can be their last. There’s no face that isn’t blurred Like a face in a dream. Hello? Yes, Dr Dora. I’m about to go into the bank. No. OK. Tell me. No, don’t touch a thing. I’ll do it when I get there. Yes... yes... I have to go now. Good bye. What are you doing here? How did you get here? I followed you. Did Isa Dora send you? She mustn’t know about this place. She mustn’t know Victor is here and that he’s still alive. Now you know it’s true. I didn’t deceive your father. No you didn’t. You’re right. We defeated death. Not forever, for a short while. But no one had gone that far. No one. It’s unstable. I hadn’t seen anything like it for a long time. Did the visitor ask you any questions? No. She was just a bit perplexed. Did she do anything out of the ordinary? Entry 564. Monday August 17th. 10.30 pm. The destruction of Leteo is irreversible. I could have made a perfect world. I lacked time. I was too impatient and I made a mistake. I started inhabiting Leteo before fully inventing it. I have no regrets. It was the only way to save him. The destruction of Leteo is irrevers... Come in. Come on in. Close the door. Come and sit down. You wanted to see me. Yes. What for? We need to get Victor out of there. You think he’ll wake up. No. I don’t think so. I think Victor will die sooner or later. But I don’t want him to die there. I need you to travel and help me bring my son back. The trips have been suspended. Isa Dora won’t give me a code to get in. That doesn’t matter I have a secret code. 1704. April 17th, Victor’s birthday. I took it in Leteo. Why didn’t he come out blurry? You tell me. Before he used to come out blurry like the other residents. Before what? Before he met you. Benedetti... look at these graphics. The disturbances in Leteo coincide with Victor’s changes in moods. Dr Dora Come now… Come here, doctor. Calm down. It hurts me just as much. Victor was the first, the host. We’ve all become very fond of him but we made a mistake. We should have chosen and prepared the residents better. Eternity isn’t for anyone. What are you doing here? Can’t you see you’re putting everyone in danger? You’re the danger. First you have to build a perfect world then inhabit it. That’s how it will be the next time. What are you doing? What are you doing? No, don’t, please. Don't kill me! You’re not dead. What? You’re not dead. You’re unconscious in a hospital. No… that’s impossible. If I weren’t dead I wouldn’t be here. I saw you. I was with you. You’re alive. Go on, get away! OUT OF ORDER. And Victor? Final entry. Tuesday, August 18th. 7 pm. Leteo no longer exists. Someone, somewhere might have noticed for an instant an increase in radiation, then nothing. Nothing. The end of years of work and the last hope of saving Victor. Any changes? No…no. I thought that with the destruction of Leteo his heart would stop but it hasn’t. There he lies in his own private Leteo. I wanted to see you. It doesn’t seem to please you much. Where are you? Tell me! Truth is I’ve come to say goodbye. My plane leaves tonight. Bye, Victor.
