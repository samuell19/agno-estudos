* Walk across the shore * Walk across the sea * Stand upon the waves * And walk with me * Journey through the door * Come see what I can see * All the reasons we were made * Who we were meant to be ANGUS: I wasn't much of a success at school. I was actually a failure. I was, basically, a cast-out and I was extremely lonely. I often used to walk in the veldt behind my house where we used to live in Zambia. And I would go and sit on my favorite anthill and talk with God. * Lift your weary head * There is too much left to lose * More than you can imagine * It's waiting there for you ANGUS: I used to sit on that anthill dreaming of preaching to thousands of people. One day I was so excited that I went to see my local minister to ask his advice. Young Buchan. Come on in. Good morning, sir. Now then, Angus, isn't it? What can I do for you today? Sir, I came here because I really need to know... I was so disappointed when he told me that I needed to get my matric, and then I had to study for a further seven years. It just didn't make sense to me. I just wanted to tell people about God's love. Then I went on this prodigal journey all over the world. And for many years I searched for the truth, but I still could not find peace and happiness. * Beyond the obvious * And what you can attain * Past the here and now * Where faith remains * Lift your weary head * There is too much left to lose * More than you can imagine * It's waiting there for you * Rise! * He is calling you to come ANGUS: In this process, one good thing did happen to me. I met my beautiful wife, Jill. And she's become my best friend, and she stood with me through thick and thin. Jill and I eventually came down from Zambia and ended up in a small town called Greytown in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. And I worked extremely hard to become a successful farmer. But the money did not bring any fulfillment at all because my heart was still so empty. This empty space in my heart was only filled when I committed my life to Christ yet once again on the 18th of February, 1979, in a small church in Greytown. Then the call to be a preacher came back stronger than ever. Yes, my first love was rekindled. * Rise! * He is calling you to come * Just leave it all behind * And rise above ANGUS: This time I decided to follow my heart and I started preaching to the workers on my farm. And I would even preach to the maize when no one could see me, imagining that the maize represented thousands of people. And a very good morning to you all! Did you bring your agricultural manuals with you? Jesus says in 2 Timothy 1:7, "I've not given you a spirit of fear, "but of power, of love, and of a sound mind." Amen! CROWD: Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! ANGUS: Thirty years later, almost on the very same spot, we erected a large stage just where the maize field used to be, and thousands of men from all over Southern Africa and even the rest of the world came to listen to the Word of God. * Rise! * He is calling you to come * Just leave it all behind * And rise above ANGUS: This is the story of how God can change people's lives just because an ordinary guy like me decided to listen to what God's call was on my life. I think of the story of John Peters, who arrived at the Mighty Men's Conference on his beautiful green Boulevard motorbike. Then we have the story of Andre Cloete, who came with his dad and his younger brother, Jake. And also, the amazing story of Lucky Nzimande, who did not even want to be there in the first place. What is this? This is not what I ordered. When I say a white Toyota Cressida 2005 and you bring me this piece of junk. But, I mean, a 2005... Shut up! (MAN SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Take this. Three, four, five. Five hundred? I'm not giving you a penny more for this piece of junk. I'm going to give you one more chance. You bring me a Mazda Double Cab Diesel, or else I don't want to see your faces again. Now get out of here. (SPEAKING WITH ACCENT) 500 rand for this car? (CHUCKLES) (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Blind... how can we work for this thief? Where must we find a Cressida 2005? I don't know, it does not exist... this guy is crazy! Don't move. Okay. Okay. Don't you...move! I'm stepping away from the car. Give me the keys. Okay, you've got the keys. You've got your keys. Get on the ground. Get on the ground! Getting down. I'm getting down. Get on the ground! (GRUNTS) Where's your gun? I don't have a gun. Give me your wallet. My wallet's in the car, next to the car seat. (YELLING) (GRUNTING) Please! Please, don't kill me. Please, don't kill me. (GUN CLICKS) (GRUNTS) (SOBBING) Wow! Beautiful house. Uh-huh. Just hang a moment. I'm going to go tell John we're here. Okay, love. John. John. John, you ready? John, you ready? John? John? Come on. What's going on, man? John. John, wake up. (JOHN GROANING) John, man. Come on, look at you, man. You're supposed to be ready now. (GROANS) (SIGHING) Look at you, man. Marlene is right outside. Yeah, okay, okay. You can't go like this. Look at you. This is not going to work. Um... You know what? I have no idea where John is. Let me just give him a call, and I'll find out what's going on. How's it, John? How's it, man? Um... Me and Marlene are at your house. Where are you? I'm sitting here with the most beautiful girl, and you're out chasing business? Bru, you need to get your head checked. JOHN: Morning, guys! Jimmy. I've been struggling for a year to get you a date with this girl, and you just go screw it up. Big deal, man. Tell her I'm sorry. I'll apologize. I'll buy her some flowers or something. I don't even know if she's going to want to go on a date with you after this. And she's good relationship material, man. You're unbelievable. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Good day. Wow! Just sign here for me, please. Sure. Marlene, these are for you. Wow. Yay! Must have been one amazing date for you to get flowers like that. It wasn't an amazing date. It was no date. The guy didn't pitch. What? "I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. John." (GASPS) Give me that. What happened? Shame, man. No, he didn't make it. What? He dumped you without even meeting you? That's bad. Charmaine. Because he rides a Boulevard. I told you, girl. Danny. And, anyway, Danny, at least I got some flowers out of it. Very nice. (ENGINE STARTS) Oh. Did you know that Andre is smoking? Did you know that he bumped his car 'cause he'd had too much to drink? I can't believe it. I don't know what's the problem with that boy. I mean, we certainly never raised him like that. I spoke to him. I asked him who is going to pay for the damages. And? And, as usual, he didn't respond. (SIGHS) You've got to talk to him. He's going to end up in jail or something worse. And, by the way, he's been smoking for quite a while. You've just been too busy to notice. Why didn't you tell me? (SCOFFS) Anyway, I think my dad, he caught me smoking today, man. (MAN EXCLAIMING) Don't worry. Don't worry. What? You mean your dad doesn't know you smoke? Bra, you smell like an ashtray. Dude, you chain smoke all the time. Well, daddy's going to pray for you. (ALL LAUGHING) So what did your daddy say anyway? He didn't say anything. He just pulled up. But I'm sure he saw me. He's going to freak out. But, Andre, you've been smoking since high school, man. My mom knows, but my dad's always been away. Right. You seriously need to move out. Business. You're a big boy now. Hey, I live there, too. You're not a big boy. I hate it there. Super conservative about stuff like that. Okay, pick a card. Pick a card. Come on. Pick a card. (ALL YELLING) Okay, drink. Yeah. Down, down, down! Down, down, down! (LAUGHING) One, two, three, go. Down, down, down. Down. Yeah! No! Come on, you've got to do better than that. Almost! Almost! Almost! Yeah! HERMAN: I should have handed you over to the police. But they would just have let you out on bail, so that you can go and rape some poor woman on a farm somewhere. Eh? I was once in exactly the same position that you are in right now. I also did some very, very bad things. Just like you. Very bad things. I was a policeman. I caught many young criminals. Just like you. But I also abused my position to force bribe money from people. I also deliberately looked the other way when some people committed crime, if they paid me enough. Then one day, God caught up with me. And he tied me to a tree, just like you. And he came at me with a sjambok, just like I am coming at you, now, today. But I did not get the lesson that I deserved because he told me about his son, Jesus. And that he would take the sjambok for me, if I would only choose. Now you must choose. I happen to be going to a great gathering of men. Men who have also done some very bad things, just like us. But we have all received God's mercy. So we're going to worship the great Unkulunkulu. Now you can come with me, or I can hand you over to the police. Today you must choose. (MEN LAUGHING) Mrs. Cloete. We're very sorry for waking you up at this time of night. Fine. Just take him to his room. Okay. Come on. Mom, don't tell Dad. Come. (LAUGHS) Where are you going? (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (SHUSHING) (LAUGHING) Okay, you get the bag. Let's go. I think we broke the bed. (LAUGHING) (SHUSHING) (SIGHS) Daddy's boy. Hey. Hey. We need to talk. Oh, Dad... You've got 30 minutes. Get out of this bed and take a shower. See me downstairs in my office. (GROANING) Thirty minutes. Yeah. Sit up, man. Sit up. I'm really worried about you. Ever since you got back from Scotland, and I don't know what happened there, it seems like everything is just falling apart. (SIGHS) Look, we're just having fun, Dad. Fun? This isn't fun. This is wrecking your life. (SIGHS) I don't know what to do with you anymore. You're smoking, you're getting motherless drunk, crashing your car. I mean, we didn't raise you like this. Eh? You're a real disappointment. This isn't what I had planned for your life. Okay, I get it. Can I go now? No. What now? Come. I'm going to pray for you. Dear Lord, you know that we love Andre and have his best interest at heart. Please show him the way home. We thank you, Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. So tell me, Lucky. Why did you need to hijack my car? Listen, I'm not going to hurt you. Just tell me honestly. I really want to know. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Just shut up you rich white dog... That doesn't seem like a very good reason. One only steals a car if you're very, very hard up or suffering badly. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You capitalist ... ... what do you know about suffering? If you go on like that, we're really not going to have any sort of decent conversation, you know. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You don't understand! Hey. Vissy! Yeah, man. Are you okay? Yes. Yeah. Okay? How's your leg? Is there something wrong? Come. Put your bag in the back. Who's your passenger? Giving somebody a lift? Lucky, I would like you to meet a very old friend of mine, Ben Wolhuter. Ben, I would like you to meet a very new friend of mine, Lucky Nzimande. Lucky has chosen to join us on our journey to Greytown. Is he the... Uh-huh. (STUTTERS) Vissy, come. One minute. Thank you. Basically, I got lost. Okay? So I stopped to get out the GPS, and this guy appears out of the dark... Listen, let's just hit the road and we can discuss this as we go along, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Have you lost your senses? He got this close to killing you. I was going to drop him off at the police station. Then I thought, "They're just going to let him out on bail, "and he's going to go and do exactly the same thing again." And then, I had this idea. Let's take him with us. What? I think it's a brilliant idea. (SCOFFS) Brilliant? Have you finally lost your mind? Why? I promise you, Wolly, it feels almost as if God has given us a mission. Did God send a criminal to kill you? You haven't heard the half of it. Come on. JIMMY: And eventually, when they got together, it was love at first sight. Marlene blew him away. She literally blew him off his feet. I've never seen him happier or more in love. And then, Marlene and her two kids moved in, and it was good. They didn't get there without their challenges, though. DANNY BOY: One of my happiest memories in my life is the very first time I was invited to join the brotherhood. All the fun times we shared, all the hardships we endured, all those challenges we faced, we faced them together. MEN: Yeah! Just like our new brother here, John. MEN: Johnny. John has stood the test of time, like we all have in the brotherhood. ALL: (CHEERING) Yeah. John, I commit to you, my man. Wear your colors with pride! (ALL CHEERING) BOTH: (SHOUTING) The Force! The Force! (YELLING) (REVVING ENGINES) (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (LAUGHS) We make the darts do the talking. Let me just close out those 20s for you, huh? (LAUGHING) You're distracting me. Just get me a beer. Let him throw first. Yes! MAN: Yeah! That's sweet. Oh, yeah! That's what I'm talking about. MAN: Beginner's luck, man. Looks like the talent's on this side of the family. Where's my beer? I'll get it. It's only a game. A game. Yeah, but it's time you taught your kids a bit of respect. What is your problem? You've been bugging everybody the whole day. You're destroying the day for everyone. Now cool it! Cool it? Why don't you cool it? (CLAMORING) (SCREAMS) Jay! Stop it! Stop it! John, that's enough! John! Stop it! What was that all about? John, you guys are drinking too much. This is way too much alcohol. And it goes on all the time. Just having a bit of fun. Fun? You call that fun? A fistfight with your brother and smashing up the furniture is fun? Stop playing and listen to me. Okay, I'm sorry. John, I'm not going to marry you unless this stops right now. I love you. But there is no way that I am bringing my daughters into this crazy situation. What do you want me to do? I want you to stop drinking. Or I'm out of here. JIMMY: For two years John kept his promise to Marlene. He didn't touch a drop. And for John, this was quite an achievement. So they got married, and John and Danny Boy became best friends, and life was good. Marlene was a very positive, positive influence on our family. ALL: * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday, dear John * Happy birthday to you (ALL CHEERING) Yeah! Go, Dad! (WHOOPING) Okay, Wolly. Listen, I'm sorry. But now we just have to make the best of the situation. Okay? I still think we should go to the nearest police station and just hand him over. You're making him our problem now. I feel like a...criminal. HERMAN: You know, since I became a Christian, I've started to look at a lot of things differently. Don't get super spiritual on me now. The reality is we're the...criminals. And with our judicial system, we'll go to jail and he'll walk free. We have to get rid of him. (PLEADING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Please, man. Please. Stop the car, please. Please, stop the car. Please, stop the car and leave me out. Shut up! Please, stop. Please, stop the car. This is ridiculous. You're harboring a...criminal. Okay, okay. Point taken. Wolly, now I want to ask you a question. What would Jesus do? Oh, come on. Don't give me that one. But I have nothing else. (WHIMPERING) Is that his gun? I thought you got rid of it. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Granny, I am so sorry... Gogo please ask God to help me... these people want to kill me... you know how we suffer at home... (WHIMPERING) Now, I stuck this gun in Lucky's face and pulled the trigger at point-blank range. It did not fire. How do you explain that? You tell me. Cheers. Cheers, buddy. Hey, buddy, sure you don't want me to drop you? I'm fine. You sure? I'm fine. Cheers. Cheers. * And when you're looking for a friend * Find yourself all alone again * I ask myself where did I go wrong? * Why does this life want to bring me down? * I know that I made a lot of mistakes * Please forgive me for losing my way * (DOGS BARKING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? (GROANING) What's wrong, Andre? ANDRE: I had an accident. I'm fine, but... You'll have to come fetch me. Oh! Where are you? Oh, my goodness! ANDRE: Down the road. Okay, love, I'm coming. Hello? Are you okay? Should I call the police? I'm fine. My mom will be in now to pick me up. Oh, my goodness! Look at the garden. You've ruined my garden. I think I should call the police. Hi. Hello. I am so sorry. Please, please, don't worry. We'll pay for absolutely everything. Is he all right? I mean, look at my garden. The agapanthuses are absolutely ruined. Is he intoxicated, or what? Should I call the police? I think I should call the police. (SOFTLY) Get in the car now if you don't wanna end up in jail. Get in the car. I am so sorry. Look, we actually live just up the street at No. 15. 15? Yeah. We're practically neighbors. But please don't worry because I'll get a tow truck in, in the morning and we'll restore your garden. Look, he is in a state of shock. Please, please, don't call the police. (BOTH LAUGHING) Look, I've come to show you something. I've got this really great contact in local government for a transport contract. I've just gotta give him a kickback, and the job's mine. Looks interesting, huh? Yeah. It's a sure thing. I just need 500K for the truck. Listen, this is gonna work. It's not something you're gonna regret. It's not easy for me, but would you be able to help me? (SIGHS) All right, Danny Boy. I don't have that kind of money now. That's okay. No, no, wait. Why don't you get, like, a bank loan? I'll stand surety for you, man. It's the best I can do for you at the moment. You mean for real? Sure. Would you do that for me, my friend? Sure. I'll give you a profit share. No, I don't want a share of profit on this. You just make sure this thing works. John, it's gonna work. It's a sure thing, my man. Thank you, thank you so... You're not gonna regret this. Thanks, John. (BEEPING) Okay. We're doing the Jesus thing now. Thanks, Wolly. What is this? I don't need this stuff from you guys. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Don't worry... ...the rich white dog paid for it. I mean, it's what we capitalists do, isn't it? We buy things? (CHUCKLES) So we're all going to Giorgio's for dinner on Friday, if you wanna come. I'll let you know. Oh, thank you. Yummy. John, thank you for helping Danny and Charmaine. You do know it means the world to me. Least I can do. Let's just hope it works for him, otherwise we're all gonna be in trouble. Yeah. Dad, Melvin has been in an accident. What happened? I don't know. This woman just phoned me and said we must come now. Were you not supposed to go and fetch him? No, Dad, Melvin decided to do his own thing. He phoned me to come and pick him up, but some biker guy gave him a lift instead. A bike? Did he have a helmet on him? I don't know, Dad. What happened here? Motorbike accident, sir. JOHN: My boy! (SOBBING) No! * Just a glimpse of your face * All my fears melt away * Lost within your embrace * I am pouring out all my adoration * Jesus, Jesus, take me over now * I surrender everything I have * I lay it down You're way behind schedule, man. You've got to pull a bit of finger here. If Melvin was still here, he'd have been done by now. Okay, Dad, I'm sorry about Melvin. (COUGHING) (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) So, tell us your story... Where did you learn to speak Zulu? I grew up on a farm... Can you please speak English so we can all understand? So why do you do crime? (SCOFFS) As if he's gonna tell you. I never knew my father, and my mother died when I was eight years old. (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Then I went to stay with my grandmother. She taught me to be a man. I remember one day I got into a fight with other boys of my village, and ran home and complained to her "Gogo, Gogo, those boys hit me." And she'd say, "Lucky, go back. Go back and fight. "Be a man. "Be a man." I never had a father figure in my life, and we were poor. I started stealing things like bread and cans of food to help my grandmother feed all of us. When she asked me where I got the stuff, I always told her that I did some piece job for the man at the shop. I could see in her eyes that she did not always believe me. My gogo was like the salt of the earth. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) After dinner, she would read stories to us from the Bible. Those were the best times of my life. (READING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) And then, she died when I was 13 years. I've been hungry in my life, and my gogo always said, "Lucky, "the big hunger is the hunger for meaning of life. "If you don't find that, you'll stay hungry forever." My gogo was gone. What could I do? I tried to do piece jobs here and there, but I started stealing things to survive. Mostly food. That is how it all started. Here, Andre. Thanks, Maria. Just tomato sauce. You look like a train went over you. I'm fine. You are searching in the wrong places. You gonna preach to me now, Maria? If there's one thing I must do this morning, it's to give you this. Oh, come on, Maria. Read that. Verse 33. You'll find your answers. Thanks. "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, "and all these things shall be added unto you." Morning, Maria. MARIA: Morning, Jake. That sounds lekker. Let's try it. Yeah, it's coming together. Hey, Andre. Check your progression. BMW. (IMITATES CRASHING SOUND) BMW again. (LAUGHING) What's next? A bicycle? Let's try this thing. From the top. I've got some lyrics for this. Listen to it and tell me what you think. * I'm turning bends and circling on this road that leads me on * I'm reaching for what's real to me * What once was true is gone * Fill my glass up just one more time * As I soldier on I might belong and feel the warmth of home * If I do believe in all of me I might just be strong * Why can't I see myself through your eyes Listen, bud, I'm sorry. I obviously pressed the wrong button. You know what? I feel so bad and you guys just pile it on as well. My dad's preaching to me and my mom's crying all the time. I never realized. I'm sorry. Get out of my downgraded car. I wanna go. Get out of my car, Xavier. Okay, relax, relax. * What if life is just * Full of lonelies at a disco * Where I dance the night away * To the beat of an aching heart * Somehow I still feel * That there must be * More to this life * Somehow I know what's real * Why can't I * Make up my mind * Over something that might define me * (INAUDIBLE) No, no, no, no, no. It's another day, it's another game. You can't make up the rules as you go along. Yeah, the guy can't find his off switch. At this rate, you're gonna come short. Dude. Inside, man. First round's on Andre, boys. Yes, sir, how can I help you? Sorry to bother you. I'm Philip Brawn from the bank. I'm sorry, but I might have some bad news for you. Grab a seat, there. My wife, Marlene. Hello, pleased to meet you. Hi. You signed surety for Mr. Harmse. Yes. Unfortunately, Mr. Harmse has defaulted on his payments, making you therefore liable for the outstanding amount of 438,000 rand. The paperwork's there if you wanna have a look. (COUGHING) I'm so sorry. Um... We're just going through a really stressful time at the moment. I'll have a look at the paperwork, and we'll get back to the bank as soon as possible. Thank you. I do appreciate it. Bye-bye. Bye. I can't believe that brother-in-law of yours. He didn't even have the decency to call me to tell me there might be a problem. So what do you want me to do, John? It is not my fault. My dad always said never sign surety for anyone. (CHUCKLES) So now it's my fault? First you thank me, and now you blame me. It is not your fault, John. It is nobody's fault. It's just one of those things. One of those things? The man could have called us. I never wanna see him again as long as I live. Never. So where does that leave me? Charmaine is still my sister, you know. Who cares! Gavin! (JOHN COUGHING) What is this? It's an invoice for clear coat. You're overspending, man. You're destroying our cash flow. Dad, we're using this. John, I have some bad news for you. You have a disease that's very common amongst people in your profession. It's called Spray Painters Lungs. It's caused by the inhalation of those fumes over the years. So how long does it take to heal? Well, I'm sorry, John, but the damage is permanent. Look, I can give you something to suppress the symptoms somewhat, but I'll never be able to actually cure your disease. I'm sorry, John. I really am. There goes my insurance. John Peters, you are in big trouble now. God, this is John. I don't know if you know me because we haven't really met. Well, not personally like this. I just came to ask... I hope you can hear me. And I hope you don't mind if I ask you for your help with a few things in my life. I'm sorry. I've been drinking. Again. Please help me. Please. That's all. Thank you. Hey, where do you think you're going? Going out. Gonna go meet my friend. Come on, Andre. You've been drinking already. You're not going anywhere, man. Back off, Dad. Not a child anymore. I'm going. ...you are. James, please leave it. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hang on, hang on. No! It's my life, Dad! Back off! Leave it now. My life. My life! Listen. Let's play it safe. Just hit it softly into the corner. Even if you miss it... I don't feel like playing it safe, brother. Fine. Don't play it safe. (LAUGHS) Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord. Lord, where did I go wrong? (SOBS) I think I've lost my son. I'm angry with him. Look! I think Andre wants to dice. MANDY: No, please, don't. Oh, come on, it'll be fun. No, it's dangerous. Don't be such a spoilsport. But the roads are wet. Please don't, it's too dangerous. Race. (TIRES SCREECHING) I've prayed. I've pleaded with him. I wish I could erase everything and just start again. You're going too fast. Just slow down a bit. Whoa. Check them out. (LAUGHING) (GIRL SCREAMING) I'll let go, I'll let go, I'll let go... Oh, no! I'll back off. Andre! Andre, buddy, can you hear me? (GROANING) TERRANCE: Juan, is he okay? He's okay. Go around and take his legs. His legs on that side. His legs are stuck. Go around and try and help me to yank it out. MANDY: Guys, the car's burning. We have to get him out! TERRANCE: Juan, just get out of the car. It's going to explode! We've gotta get his leg out. Just get out of the car! It's going to explode! JUAN: We can't leave him! Have you got it? Pull! Got his legs. JUAN: Get him away from the car. (SIRENS WAILING) Hi, Aunt Helen. It's Juan speaking. Please, Lord, give us another chance. Please, Lord, let him be okay. ANDRE: Dad? I'm right here, don't worry. You'll be all right, boy. Dad. Mr. and Mrs. Cloete. Yeah. Your son's stable now, but we don't know if he's going to make it yet. (SOBBING) What about... He has internal injuries. He has broken ribs, punctured his lungs. But the real problem is his ruptured liver. That can go either way. The next 24 hours will be crucial. We'll just have to wait and see. I'm really sorry. (SOBBING) JAMES: It's okay. (SOBBING) Andre, I know I've said things that I... And I'm not proud of that. I'm sorry. You're my boy. Forgive me for not showing you the love that I should have. I just want you to know that I love you, Andre. I want you to know that. And just... Just follow your dreams. Please. Not mine, follow your dreams. HERMAN: Time to fill up, boys. Lucky, what do you drink? Coke, please. BEN: Herman? Yeah, thanks. HERMAN: All right, thank you, you can fill it up. I got to go... (SIGHS) Yeah, well. If a man's got to go, a man's got to go, no? Oh. You're letting me go alone? I would rather crawl naked over crushed glass than be handcuffed to you in there. Oh, yeah. Oh, Lucky. I've decided to trust you. Dad. Can I talk to you? Listen, now. I went to the doctor. I had a full medical. Wanted a life insurance policy. Well, I've got some sort of a... A lung disease. The doctors can't do anything about it. I want you to promise me that if anything happens, you'll look after Marlene and the girls. Yes, of course. Of course, Dad. Listen, I'm sorry about the way I've... I'm just stressed, and the business is under financial pressure, and I miss Melvin. It's not your fault. I miss him. I miss him, too, Dad. I miss him, too. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) ...as I was saying ma... ...my son is doing his second year, studying law. Wow, he is educated. I want to understand how you manage, everything is so expensive these days. I was so blessed because he received a bursary. You are blessed, if our sons could become friends. It will be a good thing, because I'm praying to God to change his thinking, he is like a criminal... Gogo, can I sit that side? What happened to your face? It's a long story. Where are you going? I am going to visit my family. Where do you work? I work in Cape Town. You are fortunate, work is difficult to find these days. What kind of work do you do? I'm a second hand car salesman. Praise God for that, it is hard to find work. Driver, stop on the left... Well, looks like your prayers have been answered. What do you mean? He escaped. He went for a pee and didn't come back. Went out the back window. Why did you let him free? I decided to trust him. (CHUCKLES) You decided to trust him. Suppose we have to stay here for the night. Yeah, we will never get there now, today. By the way, I... I didn't pray for this. (INDISTINCT) (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Hi, how are you? (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Oh, Lucky. The big hunger is the hunger for the meaning of life. You can't find that, you'll stay hungry forever. I still think I did the right thing. You know better than anybody you can't force somebody to believe. John. Look at this. Don't you want to go to this men's conference? Please? Do it for me. I've read about this Mr. Buchan guy. He's not a minister, he's an ordinary guy. Potato farmer. He understands men and the challenges that they face. MARLENE: John, I love you. And I pray for you. Every day. I know Melvin's death broke your heart. And I know that a lot of other stuff has happened since then. Psalm 147, verse 3. It says that God heals the brokenhearted, and he binds up their wounds. Jesus wants to heal you, John. Please go to this Mighty Men's Conference. Okay, my babe. I'll go. ANDRE: After the accident, I healed miraculously, but I did not learn my lesson. Even though I healed physically, something was still very much missing. And I kept on drinking. I think it was just overcompensation for the guilt. PLAYER: We won! No way! Lekker game, eh? Yeah. Okay, what's happening? I'm sorry, I can't join you. I'm gonna go to church. Did he say "church"? Hey, bud. When did you get religious? I'm not religious. I'm a believer. There's a difference. Let's go. (GRUNTS) You're my best friend, man. You're like a brother to me. I'm sorry about the money. Why don't you come with me to this Mighty Men thing in Greytown? What's this, like a Christian thing? Have you gone soft or something? (LAUGHING) You gave me a fright. (SIGHS) Thank God. ...with the red flowers and... Hey, I bought that jacket. Hey, hey, hey. That looks familiar. (BOTH LAUGHING) HERMAN: Looks like an old friend. Hello, hello, hello. Look who we have here. Can you believe it? BEN: Ooh. What happened to his head? Not guilty. Hey, Lucky. Where you going? Guys, I'm... I'm almost home. It's fine. Yeah, well, get in. We'll give you a lift. Please, guys. Just let me go. I'm tired of this. HERMAN: Lucky. You're free. But like I told you. Now you must choose. BEN: Come on. Let me have a look at your head. No more handcuffs, I promise. Come on, get in. ANDRE: Obviously, after everything that happened, I felt extremely guilty and disappointed in myself. But the fact that my dad backed off completely made things so much worse. But he came in one day and proposed that my brother and I join him on a trip to Natal, to attend Angus Buchan's Mighty Men Conference on his farm. I wasn't a fan, but my feelings of guilt compelled me to go. JOHN: Bye-bye now. I'll call you. MARLENE: You'll be all right? Please be careful, John. Please. Girls, come on. Give me a hug. Be good, eh? Okay, bye. Bye. Bye, darling. Just enjoy it, okay? I'll try. Gavin, enjoy your day, and please tell Arina I am sorry I won't be there. Come on, Dad, before you put your helmet on. Say goodbye properly. Come here. Give me a hug. Thanks. Well, I'll see you guys after the weekend. BEN: It is difficult to describe in words how I felt when Lucky took us to his mother's and his gogo's graves that day. Lucky showed us where he grew up, h gogo's house, the school he went to as a child. I got a glimpse of his world. So fresh, innocent. But all the odds stacked up against him. This is where my aunt used to live. Right here. Upward. (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) BEN: I looked at those children's faces, and I thought how much I have and how little they have. I thought, "I can't change it, I can't change anything, "but perhaps I could make a difference "in one child's life. "In Lucky's life." At one stage, I started giving over, and I started just experiencing this journey. But all through the journey, there was something else. Some other force controlling us. Controlling all of us. Lucky. I'm so glad you decided to come with us. ANGUS: The men came by the thousands. The dream that I had as a boy, sitting on that anthill, had come to pass. God showed me once more that the only way that we can please him is by faith. And he will always reward us if we seek him. Nobody can explain why God decided to reach these men in this particular way. But he did. ANGUS: Amen! CROWD: Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! See, a good idea is not always a God idea. You need to start doing what God's told you to do. And that's why some of us here today are unhappy. Because you're in the wrong place, my boy. And that's why some of you can't understand why you got no joy in your life. You're in the wrong place at the wrong time, man. You say to me, "Angus, "I feel like I'm going to...explode "if something doesn't happen. I can't take it anymore. "The pressure's killing me, man. "I owe money. "I don't seem to be able to do anything right. "I need help." Well, that's why I'm here. I'm here to tell you that he's gonna help you. But you know what's going to happen when you go home? Things are gonna change. You're gonna start making proper decisions. And you're not gonna budge, because you've been waiting on God. You're gonna have a new life. Amen! CROWD: Amen! This is South Africa. God's got his hand on this nation. God's depending on you. God will speak to you. I know he will speak to you. I'll never forget it as long as I live. A young lady in the middle of that crowd cried out, "Angus, we want peace! "We want vrede!" (PREACHING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Everywhere I go, whether it's Israel, between Palestinians and Jews. Ireland, Roman Catholics and Protestants. Africa, black and white. One word, "peace." Well, I want to tell you we have the answer. I know him personally. I know the Prince of Peace. He gave me peace, boys. We need to do what he's told us to do. No more, no less. Then you have peace and joy in your heart. Those who wait upon the Lord, they shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings like eagles! Amen! CROWD: Amen! Amen! Amen! I come here because I'm a son, and I'm coming for my inheritance. And Jesus told me, "Angus, I've anointed you "to preach the gospel to the poor." Some of the poorest people I've met are rich people. I've met some of the richest people in the world, never mind South Africa, and they were good people. And they're lonely, and they're sad. They're trying to work themselves to heaven. It'll never work, man. Trying to win their kids' love by buying things. Doesn't work, man. Your son wants you, my boy. You tell that rebellious son of yours, "My boy, I want to tell you I love you." And spend some time in with your boy. Let him get on that tractor with you and go and work in the fields, man. Let him tend those cattle with you, man. Take him down the mine and show him what you really do, man. And you'll change his life forever. You see, it's love that covers a multitude of sins. It's not fancy scriptures and fancy talking and fancy theology. It's undiluted love. Greater love hath no man than this, than a man laid down his life for his friend. Go home and get your house in order. Starting with your own life, sir. Boys, we don't know how much time we got left, man. You didn't think you'd see me again in 2009, right? It was Saturday, it was this service, do you remember? Straight afterwards, I walked out and I had a heart attack. They took me home, I had another one. I was lying on the lawn in the front of my house, totally paralyzed. I could hear everything, I could see everything. But I could not speak or move. I was thinking, "Lord, how can this be? "I've waited for this moment all my life, and now this." It made no sense to me at all. As that helicopter pilot took off over the crowd, I saw multitudes of hands lifted up to heaven, praying for me. Then God said to me in my heart, "Do you see all these men, Angus? "I want you to realize "that I am doing the work here in these men's lives "through my spirit. "You are only the instrument "that I happen to be using at this time." One thing I learned that day, that life is but a vapor. We do not have time to waste. And we need to do the important things whilst there is still time left. Then your prayers healed me in 15 minutes on that helicopter going to Pietermaritzburg. Boys, we don't know how much time we got left, man. Maybe tomorrow. Perhaps today. Amen! CROWD: Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! (CELL PHONE RINGING) Xavier. How's it, bud? How you doing? I've got something to tell you. Oh, no, what happened? Hang on, hang on. Are you okay? Where are you? No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm on my way back from the Mighty Men Conference. And I've given my life to God. I can't believe it. Are you serious? Yeah, Uncle Angus said that I must tell the first three people that I speak to and, well, you're the first to know. You don't know how long I've been praying for you, bud. Thank you. * Come waltz with me through the twilight Thank you. * And we will dance as seasons pass * We move together * I'll be forever yours * So hold me tight * Say you'll be mine * For all your life * Till death comes between us * And the heavens steal you away * I'll stay yours forever * Don't you worry * Don't be afraid MAN: What's going on? STEPHEN: John and I... I suppose you could hardly say met, but when we found John on a cold, miserable, rainy day after the accident, I started praying for John. That's the first thing that I did. And while I was praying for him, I heard God loud and clear in my head, "Stephen, you can stop praying now. "John's with me." And it was literally a couple of seconds later that John took his last breaths. I think the thing that struck me is that when that happens, you realize very quickly that life can be snuffed out in an instant. It just happens so quickly. It's great for me to be able to tell you that just the day before, John gave his heart to the Lord. So I have no doubt whatsoever that he's gone home. That he's free, that he's completely healed. We sort of get mixed up in all the questions, "Do I do enough each day to get into heaven? "Have I done enough and put in enough time to earn God's favor?" When actually, just like John, all you need to say is, "Lord, I give you my heart. "Thank you for your forgiveness." It's as easy as that. "Thank you for your love. "For your grace. "Thank you for your favor. "And thank you for Jesus." And today, we say thank you for John. (BIKE ENGINES REVVING) Lord, I'm scared. And I'm alone. Please. I'm gonna miss you, John. * Strange... I'm gonna miss you. * ...the path we choose * I've tried but failed to walk in someone else's shoes * Strange how I've tried * To walk this road alone not knowing * The things I might find JAMES: What this boy needed was my acceptance. Not expectations. Acceptance, from me. His father. * But now that I have given in * Your love has washed away my sin * I know I'm * I know I'm * I know I'm * Forgiven * I know I'm * I know I'm * I know I'm * Forgiven LUCKY: I came back to Gugulethu to tell people how much God loves them. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Kappi. Kappi. God's grace for you. And your friends. All the best. Thanks. Thank you for everything, man. Bless you. You take care now. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Here is God's word for you... Lucky... what is this? God's word... (CHUCKLES) This is rubbish. Rubbish, man. Kappi listen here... I do not want to listen... Kappi you must change... * Jesus, Jesus * Take me over now LUCKY: I want to be an Angus Buchan for the Cape Flats. And for the first time in my life, I felt that I had a purpose. I know my gogo would have been proud of me. God's ways are most of the time so different to our ways. In a shepherd boy, he saw a great king. In a potato farmer, he saw a mighty man for Christ. What does he see in you? * Walk across the shore * Walk across the sea * Stand up on the waves * And walk with me * Journey through the door * Come see what I can see * All the reasons we were made * Who we were meant to be * Rise! * He is calling you to come * Just leave it all behind * And rise above * Beyond the obvious * And what you can attain * Past the here and now * Where faith remains * Lift your weary head * There is too much left to lose * More than you can imagine * It's waiting there for you * Rise! * He is calling you to come * Just leave it all behind * And rise above * Come and stand * And join with me as one * Now take my hand and we * Will rise above * Yeah, yeah (VOCALIZING) * Yeah, yeah * Yeah * Yeah * Rise! * He is calling you to come * Just leave it all behind * And rise above * Come and stand * And join with me as one * Now take my hand and we * Will rise above (VOCALIZING) * Come stand with me * Come stand with me
