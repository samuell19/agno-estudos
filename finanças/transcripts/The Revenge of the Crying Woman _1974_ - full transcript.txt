(exciting music) (exciting music) - Match between Santo, the idol of the crowd, and Dragon, the trainer of champions continues. We have all expected this match for a long time, and now, thanks to the Mexican Television Network, it's finally here. This match will surely be full of incredible moves by both wrestlers. Flying leg lock on Dragon. Dragon tries to escape the move, and does so with the strength of his arms. Dragon is famous for... - Professor Lira will surely try to get Santo's help in order to carry out his plan. - Are we going to stop Santo from interfering? - We'll also Santo to help him through the dangerous parts. And then... - However, Santo quickly gets up and escapes the attack. - We'll kill him. - Then, as they say, we will harvest the fruits of our neighbor's labor. (laughing) - His skills. And now using the ropes, (grunting) he does an arm-whip take down. (audience clamoring) He had no problem putting his own arm in danger to escape from the hold by Dragon. And now he is using a hammer hold on him. Dragon can't do anything about it, and is now driven right in the mat. Dragon has taken a nasty fall onto his left shoulder. However, he lands near the ropes, and the referee has to break the move. What a spectacle from the silver masked man. But now he suffers an inverse headlock. But just look at that strength he is showing. He used his incredible strength to send Dragon flying. And now he uses his favorite arm and neck lock, which is followed by a slam onto the top turnbuckle. He wants to repeat the dose just to make sure he's done. (grunting) Santo is taking no chances right now. He knows his rival is incredibly dangerous. Irish whip to the ropes. Now Dragon takes a nasty, perfectly executed, overhead slam by Santo. Santo, as always, is giving the crowd an unforgettable show. He goes for an arm bore. He is trying to make Dragon tap out. Dragon screams no. He uses all of his strength, because he knows that if he defeats Santo, even if it's only one fall, he will become a star in the annals of history of the world wresting scene. - But I don't want to watch wrestling! I would rather watch cartoons. - What are you doing here? - Why are you awake? - Because I woke up and I got scared, so now I want to watch my favorite cartoons. - Get up. - Look at Santo. What a clean escape with that hand spring. However, Dragon now aims to the right leg of Santo. It seems he's hurting there. But Santo shows us his medal, and escapes again. The crowd has noticed that Santo never loses his patience. Even when Dragon had the chance to punish him. - Go for his eyes with your left hand! - Santo would never do something like that. - The other wrestler is a cheater. Santo would have to be rougher. - Mexican surfboard. Both arms and legs are being punished. That move is so dangerous. (thudding) It takes a lot of strength and mind games to apply it. Dragon is convinced he can defeat Santo, and so he doesn't stop fighting. He goes for the ropes. Since he hasn't been able to escape the hold from Santo. - Use the back-breaker, Santo, back-breaker! - Go to bed. - Only if Carlos comes to bed, too. - Carlitos, please take your sister to bed. - Take her to bed? But what about the match? - You've already seen two falls. - But the third one isn't over. He's hurting Santo, get him, finish him! - Santo can't hear you. You are cuckoo. - What a fall Dragon has taken on that corner. That top turnbuckle has been used time and time again against Dragon, who is now looking quite exhausted. Santo uses a body slam. (thudding) And now he goes to the top. Risky move by Santo. But oh, suicide drop by Santo. And he goes for the cover! One, two, three! Santo takes the win. He won with that high-flying maneuver. (crowd cheering) - Uncle Esteban is meeting Santo. You think he will convince him to do that weird job? - Hm, I would love that. - To convince him, Sonia? - No, I would love to meet Santo. - Excuse me sir, Santo has arrived. He came with his mask and everything. - Ah, bring him in. - Could I please stay here during your conversation with Santo, Professor? - Of course, Professor Alvarez. I have no secrets from you. - Thank you, Professor. - My name is Professor Lira. And you sir need no introduction. - It's an honor to meet you, Professor. - The honor is mutual, Santo. Professor Luis Alvarez. My assistant and friend. - Nice to meet you. - It's a great honor, Santo. - Here, please take a seat. - I read your book, about legendary events of the new Spain. - That's great, because the two of us were just about to talk about those past events. - I'm at your service, Professor. - I need your help to open an old grave, and taking from the body an old medallion. - Desecrating graves, and stealing from the dead, is something I wouldn't even think of doing. Please excuse me, Professor. - Please wait, Santo. That medallion contains a map with the directions of a treasure trove which contains 100,000 gold Doubloons that belong to the King of Spain, and would belong to whomever finds them. 100,000 gold Doubloons have an approximate current value of 80 million pesos. That whole fortune will be donated in its entirety to the Mexican Children's Welfare Institute to build many hospitals in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of children. If you had shown me the most minimum personal interest in those 80 million pesos, I would've already stopped. - I still stand by my rejection of desecrating graves, and robbing the dead. - I think opening a recent grave is desecration. But if the grave is 300 years old, opening it is archeological investigation. - Keep talking, Professor. - The person in that grave, in life, was Miss Eugenia Esparza, who committed suicide in the year 1678, after claiming the life of her three children. Soon after the death of Miss Eugenia Esparza, a legend began spreading around which said her specter wandered through the night, crying and screaming miserably for the souls of the poor little children she killed. - Are you talking about the legend of La Llorona? - Yes, my friend. - Uh huh. - I discovered the truth behind that legend, and I know where we can find the grave of Miss Eugenia Esparza. The information of La Llorona and what she did is registered in these old documents I gathered through many investigations and inquiries, which took me many years. (gentle ominous music) One April night in the year 1678, Miss Eugenia Esparza received a strange visitor. - Did you bring what I asked for? - Yes, and something else. But before I give you the lethal poison, I wish to know who you will use it on. - Don Juan de Gonzaga, the man I have lived with for 10 years and who gave me three sons. He plans to abandon me and marry a Spanish aristocrat. Leaving me with nothing but shame and dishonor. - But isn't he your husband? - He's not my husband, but he asked for my hand in marriage. - There was no commitment. - Year after year he postponed our wedding with nothing but lies. And now he plans to marry another. Not content with destroying my life, he plans to take my children away, using all his power, position, and rank. - So you will poison him. - Using poison would be too kind of sweet of a death for that bastard. He will have a horrible and dishonorable death. But first, I will break his heart in two. - Tell me how. - That miserable and evil pig loves our sons. Well then, I will hurt him through them. I will kill them. - And you? - I will kill myself using that same poison. - And what is the death you will bring to Juan de Gonzaga? - As you might know, he's the treasurer of the Vice Royalty. And he had here in a coffin, 100,000 gold Doubloons, which have to be sent to the King of Spain. But those Doubloons will never reach him, because I took advantage of his temporary absence to hide that treasure somewhere neither he nor anyone else will ever find. - Therefor, Juan de Gonzaga will be charged and convicted for stealing the riches of the King. - He will be blamed, condemned, and executed without any honor left. That will complete my deserved revenge. - One drop of this poison in water or a cup of wine will be enough. - But what if that wicked man were acquitted, and married that woman? And he had other children? - If that were the case, my lord will give you the power to rise from your grave, to keep looking for revenge with his descendants. So it's spoken in this document. Read it and sign it. (gentle music) You must sign it with your blood. From the moment you sign this contract, you stopped being part of God's flock. Now you are a servant to my lord Lucifer. - I know. (gentle eerie music) - That same night, Miss Eugenia Esparza poisoned her three children, and then herself. Since it was suicide, the church denied her proper burial, and her body lies in a cavern, and can be located somewhere in these documents. - What happened to Mr. Juan de Gonzaga? - As Miss Eugenia Esparza feared, Juan de Gonzaga was acquitted. He married again and of course, had other children. One night, the inhabitants of the house of Don Juan were woken up by the macabre wailing of a woman. The sound of miserable screaming and crying, Don Juan and his wife hurried to the childrens' room, and found that the older one had been horribly strangled to death. That mysterious tragedy was the origin of the legend of La Llorona. But after a long and exhaustive investigation, I discovered that in all the families that come directly from the bloodline of Don Juan, the first born son died of strangulation. (Beeping) And each time that happened, the horrible crying of a woman could be heart. - A man of science like yourself can't really believe that the specter of Mrs. Eugenia Esparza comes back from the grave to exact revenge on innocent children. - My friend. (buzzing) I stand by the facts. My family is the Gonzaga bloodline, and my first born son died in the same horrible way I've told you. (eerie music) I heard the cries myself. The horrible wailing of a woman when that tragedy happened. It's very easy not to believe and turn your back on the mystery, but the fact is that terrible threat now looms over my poor grandson. And I have taken it upon myself to fight Miss Esparza in her own grave. And rip the secret from her. - Which secret is that? - Before she passed away, she gave the order to her most loyal servant to put on her corpse the medallion which contains the map to the place where she hid the treasure. The servant did and then killed himself. - Can we come in, Uncle? - Just wait a minute. (giggling) They are both my nieces and secretaries. They keep up to date with all my projects. But let's get back to business now. I have sought the help of many expert demonologists. And they all agree that by using the treasure to save the lives of children, the soul of Miss Esparza will be freed from her satanic contract, and my grandson will be safe. - I'm pretty sure Satan wouldn't want anything else to do with Miss Eugenia. Because her gold will save more children's lives than the ones she took herself. - You might be saying that in jest, Santo, but it will happen. - I wouldn't dare to mock your beliefs and convictions, Professor, but I can assure you that my only interest in this situation is to use that fortune to help all the children in need. - Then I can count on you? - Count on me, Professor. - A moment has passed, can we come in? - Yes, come in. You must be excited to meet my guest. This is Sonia, and this is Lilia. - Nice to meet you. - If you took your mask off, we could get acquainted even more. - I have a lot of friends, but also a lot of enemies. The mob has too many grudges against me. - And you keep them away by hiding your identity? - Well, something like that. - I prefer to look at you always wearing the silver mask. - Thank you, Sonia. Well, I will be back at 10:00 p.m. to pick you up, Professor. Excuse me. - See you. Are you going tonight to Miss Esparza's grave? - Yes, darlings, tonight. - Well, we're going too. - No, you're not coming. - Why not? - 'Cause it could be dangerous. - What kind of danger? - I don't know. (punching) (panting) - Come on, one, two. - How are you, Santo? - Do you believe in ghosts, Mantequilla? - Yes of course. - Have you seen one? - I told you I believe in ghosts, even though I have never seen one. I would like to find one, or two, or three. - And would you like to find, I don't know, the ghost of La Llorona? - How can you ask that, man? Of course I would like it. - Well, I don't think we are going to find her ghost, but we will find her bones, ashes, or whatever is left of her. - The bones of La Llorona? Count me in. - Mantequilla, you will help me open her grave? - We're opening the grave of La Llorona? To comfort her or what? - I'll tell you on the way. (upbeat music) I thought your assistant, Professor Alvarez, was coming with us. - Alvarez is way too skittish for this job. He has never been to a funeral or seen a dead body. - Uncle has never lied to us, but he didn't want us to come. - He overprotects us. (upbeat music) - I insist on my previous and much repeated opinion, that we should eliminate my eminent colleague and his two helpers inside of that cover, which will allow us, without any more problems, to seize the medallion. - You may have your opinion, but I have orders, and I will carry them out. - Santo, at kilometer 37, we'll get off the road. (upbeat music) - Don't let them out of your sight. - Why don't you do that? I already have to make sure we don't crash into a tree. - Ah, over in that bluff there. (upbeat music) Right there. (engine rumbling) - It's here. (eerie music) - The entrance to the cavern must be behind those rocks! - You mean, Professor, we have to move a giant boulder? - Unfortunately, yes. - What do you think, Santo? - Do you want to see La Llorona, yes or no? - Of course, man. - Well, let's do it then. - Let's go. (light eerie music) (grunting) (ominous music) (grunting) (gentle music) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (ominous music) (gentle music) (ominous music) (gentle music) (ominous music) - Well then, are we doing this or what? Coming all the way here and not entering would be lame. - Well, let's go in. - Okay. Take out your flashlight. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - Look, it must be over there! (ominous music) - That way? - I think so. (suspenseful music) - Probably that way. (ominous music) (grunting) (creaking) (ominous music) It's Miss Esparza! And that's the medallion we're looking for! - Mm-hmm, well, our job here is done. Let's go. - What do you mean go? Nothing's happened. - What do you want to happen? - Something, a ghost appearing, or a specter, something. Because this lady is neither of those. - Don't be so rall, let's go. (ominous music) - Santo, Santo! (gasping) Miss Eugenia just moved. - Eh, she has been dead for 295 years. - She's been dead 2000 years. But I saw her move. (eerie music) Oh crap! - I'm scared out of my wits. - I've been shaking like a leaf for a while. - Uncle. Uncle Esteban! - Santo! (eerie music) - I think we should cover the cavern entrance again, and keep people from going in. - Also prevent Miss Eugenia from coming out. - One way or another, we have to close off the cavern entrance. - Ooh, I became a tow truck. (eerie music) (grunting) - They must have gone through this passage. Let's go look for them. - I would rather leave. I'm really scared now. - I'm way more scared than you. We didn't come here for nothing. So we'd better go look for them. - Okay, let's go then. (grunting) (ominous music) - Ah, let's go. (ominous music) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) - Wait man. (ominous music) (intense howling) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (light music) (ominous music) (gasping) - My God, what do we do? - What do we do? - Uncle! - Uncle! - Santo! We have to do something to get out of here. - But what, Lilia? - We have to move these rocks. Uncle! - I found a lipstick near the entrance of the cavern. - From my nieces. - They followed us and went into the cavern. Follow me. (eerie music) (screaming) (ominous music) (grunting) - Hurry. (grunting) Keep going. (intense howling) (eerie music) (ghost wailing) (screaming) Calm down, girls! What's wrong, what's wrong? - Wait, wait, calm down, calm down. Calm down, chica. Calm down. - Hey hey hey. - Take it easy, take it easy. Calm down. - Calm down, calm down. - What happened? What's going on? I told you not to come. - Take it easy. Take a break, come on. - Calm down. - Come on, take a break. There, there, it's over now. Don't worry. - Calm down. You're safe with me now, aren't you? You have me, me, your knight in shining armor. Be careful, okay? - Freeze! Don't move. We have no intention of harming you in any way, Professor. If you kindly hand us the medallion you took from Miss Eugenia Esparza, we will let you go. - How is it you know about the medallion of Miss Esparza? - We know everything about it. Give me the medallion. (light ominous music) - I don't have it. There was no medallion. - You are lying, old man. We've been watching you since you arrived here. Give me the medallion, you have it! - The Professor is still behind. He might get lost. Please take the girls to the car. I'll go look for him. (smacking) (suspenseful music) - I'm tired of you, old man. Search for it! - Here it is, boss. - I'm really sorry I have to kill you, old man. But if I let you go, you could go and make a scene regarding this treasure, and my boss wishes for privacy on this. (smacking) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (smacking) (smacking) (gasping) (ominous music) (La Llorona wailing) (gun firing) (intense howling) - Let's get out of here, come on! (eerie music) - Where are you going so fast, man? Why are you so scared? - Please let us go, she's coming here. - Who's coming? - A dead woman. She's horrible. Please let us go. - That might have been Miss Eugenia. I saw her, she was moving. Were you by any chance in a strap with El Santo? - Yes. (smacking) (grunting) - Take that. (suspenseful music) - We're okay. - What happened to you, man? - Where are the Professor and the girls? - Where we left them, I think they're still there. - Let's go. (suspenseful music) (groaning) - That's impossible! - It might be impossible, but that's what happened! - I'm glad you're alive and unhurt! My nieces saw Miss Esparza's empty coffin. And then they saw her there without her bandages. - Yes, we saw her, she's horrifying. - I told you, chico, those men also saw her outside of the cavern. (engine rumbling) Forget about those bastards! (light ominous music) - So we'll go back to the cavern? - No! - I think there is no point in going back to the cavern because Miss Eugenia already left. What's your opinion, Professor? - I believe we should make sure Miss Esparza isn't there. - And move those stones again? - Nothing in this world will make me enter this scary, horrible cavern again. - Nothing in this world will make me stay here alone. - I will gladly stay with both you chicas right here. - Why? - Because Miss Eugenia's not there. - Stop fooling around. We are all going on. - For real? - Yes. (light eerie music) (ominous music) - You see how I was right, Santo? 295 years inside that box, and still Dona went out for a walk. - This is amazing! The boy! - What boy? - Carlitos, my grandson! (gentle music) Shush, go. (humming) - Everything's fine here. Totally fine, totally fine. - I think we shouldn't leave Carlitos alone for even a second. - And the girl? - Well, according to the hypothesis of Professor Lira, the specter's anger will only target the older boy. - Because he's a first-born. - So far, Miss Esparza has only targeted the first-born sons. - Up until now? - Mantequilla, you don't know about this stuff. - Almost no one knows about the dead, and their intentions. - True, but who's gonna stay with the children? - You and me. - Uh huh. - Both of you already saw Dona Eugenia. Santo and I haven't. We have to make teams, chico. I want to see her, I must see her. (ominous music) (intense howling) (ghost wailing) (screaming) - No, no! (screaming) (intense music) - Hey, do you think the ghost will come? - I don't know. - It would be kind of lame if she didn't. Don't you think so? - I think your curiosity for seeing a being from the afterlife is consuming you. - And not you? - I only wish to know who is behind all of this. - The Devil, man, the Devil. (gentle music) - Look, it's Santo and Mantequilla Napoles. Now what? - They are not real. - You think they're wax dolls? - Let me see. They are moving but they don't speak. - It's because you haven't spoken to them. - Then you tell them something. - What do I say to them? - Ask why they're here. - Why are you here? - Why are we here? - Mantequilla, you know why we are here. - Yes I do, but I don't know how to explain it to Carlitos. Because the youth of today don't believe in ghosts. - What do you think? - Now I know we are dreaming. - Yeah, and it's a really cool dream. I hope Sonia doesn't come wake us up. - You can tell me how the dream ended tomorrow. - I saw your fight with La Sal on TV. You got him in the fourth round! Just like this. - That's not true. It was like this, see? - No, I saw it, and I remember the end. - Okay, you are La Sal, and I am me. - No, I should be you, and you're La Sal. Oh man, this is such an awesome dream. If only I was really arguing with the great Mantequilla Napoles. But that's okay, I'll settle with not being woken up by Sonia. If you two had a fight, who would win? - We wouldn't fight each other, because first of all, we are friends. And second, Mantequilla is a boxer, and I am a wrestler. - You still should fight. Or maybe you're afraid. - There is no space here. The room is too small. - Let's go to the garden. (grunting) (steady music) Look, space is no problem here! - How many rounds does this fight have? - Two out of three falls with no limit. - Santo, stop talking and start fighting. (steady music) Come on, why are you waiting? Start the match! (steady music) (grunting) (intense howling) (grunting) (smacking) (ominous music) Santo! Mantequilla! I'm over here! - What's wrong, Carlitos, what's happened? - She's over there, over there! - Who is there? - The woman! - So a walking mummy, huh? - You don't believe us, boss, that we saw a walking mummy? - How could I believe in such stupid superstitions? - It may be superstitious boss, but we saw it. Manotas here emptied his whole damn clip in her, and the dead woman kept walking like nothing happened. - I don't want to hear any more of this crap! I sent you to retrieve the medallion, and how did you return? All beaten up! Frightened and with nothing in your empty hands. - Give us another chance, boss. Tonight, we can rob the house of Professor Lira. - Professor Alvarez will be in charge of getting the medallion. The calm and easy way, you stupid fools. - She was seen by the girls, the mobsters, and Carlitos, and I haven't lost hope of seeing her, man. - Well, I still don't believe in ghosts. - Well I do, Santo. And one thing is believing, and the other is being sure. - And you just can't live ignorant and happy? - Can you? - Me neither. Look Mantequilla, the mobsters who attacked us near the cavern are surely members of a powerful gang. They somehow found out about the existence of the 100,000 gold Doubloons, and they are looking for a way to take that huge fortune for themselves. They secretly spied on us as we entered the cavern, and they almost killed Professor Lira. To steal the priceless medallion of Miss Eugenia Esparza. What I'm trying to say is this. The specter could very well be a trick by those gangsters to keep us distracted while they get what they want, which is the treasure. - I really want to find one of those mobsters. - Have you seen on the news? Beautiful young woman dies under mysterious circumstances. Miss Maria Luisa Ortiz Gonzaga was strangled inside her own home. The killer left without a trace. The neighbors said they heard a strange lament. - We might have to believe in La Llorona. - Remove the might. Let's go see Professor Lira. - Maria Luisa Ortiz Gonzaga. - A descendant of Mr. Juan de Gonzaga. - Yes. My friends. Now there is absolutely no doubt that Miss Esparza is back in the world of the living. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Good afternoon, ma'am. - Good afternoon. I was just looking at this boy, who looks just like my son. He was his age when he passed away. - I'm so sorry to hear that, ma'am. - I just moved to the house next door. And I am quite lonely. If you could please allow the children to visit me, I would be very thankful. - The parents of the children are traveling through Europe. But their grandfather is here. If you wish, I could ask him. - Maybe another day. Right now, I am in a hurry, thank you. - Didn't Miss Eugenia only attacked the first born of the Gonzaga bloodline. - Yes, but the murder of this young lady last night reveals that she will attack all the descendants of Gonzaga. Not only the first-born boys. - You believe that, Professor? - Mm. The reason for that is that we separated her from her medallion, and I fear her vengeance will be merciless. (gentle eerie music) (dog barking) (door slamming) - What could be wrong with Duke? I'll take a look. - Look, don't go. - But why not? - I don't know. It's funny, but I'm scared. - Don't be silly. I'm gonna look. (ominous rumbling) - No, don't go, don't leave us! - Candles, bring me some candles. (eerie beeping) (dog barking) Well. (laughing) (ominous music) (clearing throat) (dog barking) (eerie music) - Jesus! (metal clanging) - What the hell? What the hell is happening here? - It looks like the wind has broken one of the windows on the second floor! - No, it wasn't the wind. Someone came into the house, and here she comes. (eerie music) - Who are you? - In just a moment, you will die. And after you are dead, you will know who I am. (intense howling) (wailing) - And so begins the match between the champion, (bell dinging) Mantequilla Napoles, and the challenger, Mitsu Nori. The boxer from the far East. This match has been in the making for a long time, and now it has been made a reality thanks to the Mexican Television Network. - Mantequilla is looking for a way to break Mitsu Nori's guard, but the Japanese boxer has quick feet, and quickly escapes to the left side of the ring. Mantequilla also has quick feet, and so the match will be at lightning speed. Just look at Jose Mantequilla Napoles. He knows how to move his body, and has broken Mitsu Nori's guard. Heavy left hook to the ribs by Mantequilla. Mitsu Nori tries to move to escape the center of the ropes, but Mantequilla keeps attacking him relentlessly with his famous left hook. Mantequilla is trying to leave Mitsu Nori out of breath by demolishing his ribs with body blows. He sways from one side to the other while protecting his body with the elbows. Mitsu Nori is desperately trying to stop Mantequilla's attack. The attack form a world champion, Jose Mantequilla Napoles. Heads collide in the ring, and Mitsu Nori strikes with a right hook. But the exchange continues and once again, Mantequilla has cornered his opponent, and sticks to him with expertise. He is the man with the quick feet and the heavy blows. Mitsu Nori starts to look tired. Mantequilla has simply left him no space for recovery. The Japanese man looks for more distance in this match, but Mantequilla says no. Mantequilla is dodging all the attacks from his opponent, but wow, he takes a heavy hook to the right side! But still, it seems it has no effect. Mitsu Nori is looking for a chance, and he exits the ropes by using his left foot. But Mantequilla stays right next to him and corners him against the ropes. Mitsu Nori's back was against the ropes again. So he escapes to the right of the ring, with many side steps. Mantequilla uses jabs to aim his blows, and nails the Japanese man again in the ribs. Mantequilla wants to force the Japanese man to drop his guard. However, Mitsu Nori's guard is solid. Oh, look at that exchange of body blows by both men. They are both aiming to their rival's stomach. Mitsu Nori is out of breath. This could be it! Oh, Mitsu Nori is down after an amazing left hook to the jaw by Mantequilla. - Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, knockout! - The champion, Jose Angel Mantequilla Napoles wins by a knockout! - Uh huh. Thank you. I just learned that the family of the four who were murdered were descendants of Don Juan de Gonzaga. We have unleashed a Satanic force that we must stop now. - What if we go to the police? With what we know, or believe to know. - Go to the police and tell them that the murderer is the specter of La Llorona? - You're right, Professor. They wouldn't believe us. - I translated the information of the map and the medallion. We'll go right now for that treasure. Because the moment that fortune is used to save the life of the children, this terrible vengeance of La Llorona will come to an end. - Then what are we waiting for? What do you say, Santo? - Same as you. Let's go. (gentle music) - Thank you, Professor. With this, we can consider your services are over. Thank you. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (gasping) - The medallion and all the maps I made are gone! - Bring Professor Alvarez here. - According with your instructions, Professor Alvarez was eliminated after he gave us all this stuff. - This seems to be a map, but I can't understand it. - We have been stripped of the only resource we had in our hands in order to stop the chain of horrible murders, which now will continue until all the bloodline of Don Juan disappears. - We will have to kidnap Professor Lira to have him decipher the map for us. But first we have to kill Santo and Mantequilla, so the kidnapping of the Professor can go unnoticed. We need no scandals about our treasure. - We need to devise a plan to ensure they die. - If at least one of you actually had the ability to think, you wouldn't work for me. I'm the only one who thinks around here. (phone ringing) - Hello? Yes, this is Santo. What? Repeat the address. Yes, we'll be there. Someone called to say they have Professor Alvarez alone with the medallion and the maps. And are willing to give him back under certain conditions. That he will only tell us if we agree to go, just you and me. And if we talk to the police, they will kill Professor Alvarez. What do you think? - It's clear as day. Obviously it's a damn trap, and we will fall for it voluntarily. But what else can we do? - Don't go! It's really dangerous. - We must go, Professor. It's the only chance we have to find out something. (cars rumbling) (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (smacking) (grunting) (smacking) (thudding) (crashing) (smacking) (grunting) (banging) (growling) (smacking) (choking) Who sent you? Answer me. - Mr. Severo Segovia. (grunting) (crashing) (suspenseful music) (smacking) (grunting) (banging) (grunting) (suspenseful music) Hey move that car. Now we know what we're going to do now. - So are we going to their stronghold? - We will wait until the gang reunite us with their boss. That way, we'll catch them all. - But they're gonna escape. They're gonna think we called the police. - Mr. Severo is not a fool. He knows well we have nothing to hang on him. - Are we going there alone? That would be suicide! - I have a plan that cannot fail. Do you trust me? - How can you ask that? Ah, you think I hang out with you to learn about wrestling? No, chico. - We have all expected this match for a long time. And now, thanks to the Mexican Television Network, it's finally here. No one doubts the training Adonis had to prepare for this match. - Go on Santo, do it again, aye aye aye! Everyone has skills - But now Adonis takes down Santo with a leg sweep. (grunting) Is he going for a giant swing? (crowd cheering) No, Santo breaks into a move. - Watch out, don't let him get up, chico! - Adonis targets Santo's legs again. But Santo escapes, making use of his tremendous strength. This is why Santo is the idol of the crowd. Good punch! (smacking) But Santo counters with a judo flip. That was a great jump by adonis. Scissor take-down by Santo! (grunting) And he repeats the dose again with ease. Santo just might be playing with... - Come on, come on, come on! Finish him, Santo! - A hit to the jaw bit Adonis. Santo is down. - Come on, come on, do it, Santo! Do it, come on, chico! Beat him like his daddy! - Adonis tries to break free from Santo's arm hold. - Kick him! Come on, chico, what are you doing? Come on, kick him, kick him! You gotta do it, Santo, come on! - However, Santo uses his whole body and sends Adonis flying. He has to use the ropes to get up. Santo follows up the attack with a headlock. Adonis escapes. But he receives a flying headbutt. Up, down, great follow-up by Santo. Adonis gets up, wanting revenge. But Santo Immediately puts him into full Nelson line. (sighing) But Adonis escapes and grabs his arm. He has to be careful now. But look at that. That's why Santo is the greatest of wrestlers. He is putting his arm on the line to punish... - Kick him! You can kick him, so kick him, Santo! - They walk to the center of the ring. Adonis tries to escape, (grunting) and to trap Santo with his legs, but Santo goes for the full Nelson again. Adonis is really strong. But now he faces one of the moves invented by Santo. Santo uses the locksmith choke. Adonis uses all his strength to escape. However, Santo now uses an arm and neck lock to make him tap. The pain on the neck must be agonizing. Adonis resists the attack. He escapes, with patience. But Santo is also being very patient. He knows he has to be. Just like in the good old days of wrestling. That's why he is an idol. Adonis with a leg lock. But Santo escapes. (grunting) - Look at that! Way to go, Santo! - Adonis now targets Santo's arm again. Santo must use all his strength and skills now to resist the pain. (grunting) And wow, what an escape! Just like that, beautiful escape. Adonis didn't expect a move like that. (door creaking) Attacks Santo with a heavy blow to the jaw. (growling) (intense howling) (gasping) Adonis is running out of options. (Announcer drowned out by growling) He yells. (choking) (announcer chattering) (grumbling) (booming) Santo now jumps in for the kill, and he puts Adonis in a neck and arm board. Adonis taps out! Victory goes to Santo. (crowd cheering) - I don't care as much about your failure as I do your ridicule. Next time you fail me like this, there will be hell to pay. - Boss, one of the men in charge of kidnapping Professor Lira wishes to speak with you. - Send him in. - There's news, boss. Professor Lira was strangled last night. His body was found by his nieces in his studio. Santo, Mantequilla Napoles, and the police are on the scene. (ominous music) - The coroner shouldn't take long. (weeping) - I think it's time we pay a visit to Severo Segovia. - I'm ready, chico! - Please watch over Carlitos. We have something to do. We will return at dusk. Come on. (cars rumbling) (grunting) - What's that? - These capsules contain a special gas in really high doses. Can you hold your breath for three minutes? - I'm offended you think otherwise. - Alright then. When I tell you, stop breathing, bro. - I just hope it's not forever. This is the house of Severo Segovia? - This warehouse is just a facade to high luxurious facilities. - So how are we going to get in? - First we knock on this door, and then we enter through that window. (banging) I wish they actually had an alarm system. (banging) - I think I heard someone! - Let's go. (suspenseful music) (grunting) Push those boxes. (crashing) (ominous music) - They're coming! - Hurry up. (grunting) (crashing) - Go. (suspenseful music) Three men over there! The others with me. (ominous music) (crashing) Come. (crashing) Why are you making such a ruckus? We knew you were coming! - Ready? - Yes. (banging) (coughing) (suspenseful music) (steady rock music) (banging) (coughing) - Really clever. I congratulate you. I'm drinking my favorite brandy. Would you gentlemen like a cup, or something else? - Some pineapple juice. - And you, Santo? - Bud, I really never drink alcohol. I guess you know why we are here. - Yes, surely. You came here to recover the medallion of Miss Esparza. I could refuse to hand it over to you. But then you and your partner might try to take it by force. And you know I hate violence. (ominous music) - I am thankful you decided to take this away. - I don't know about you, but I think it's time to call the police. - I wasn't going to report you, but if Mr. Napoles insists. - Huh, I think we've been had. - What do you mean, chico? - Gentlemen, you just committed robbery, using a dangerous gas, in my abode. - But you stole the medallion! - A medallion you say belongs to La Llorona. I can only imagine the look on the policeman's face when you accuse me of robbery of a medallion that belongs to La Llorona. - He is right, there is nothing we can do here. Let's go. (mysterious music) This line and this part match completely. - It's clear now. Without this map, we couldn't have translated the one from Miss Eugenia. - Yeah, we have to pinpoint exact place in this general map of Mexico City. This is the place. - While you were sleeping like babies, I gave back to Santo and Mantequilla the medallion and the maps. - Why did you give it back, boss? - So they can find the 100,000 gold Doubloons. Surely the Professor left behind a clue to be able to translate that cursed map. - And what do we get if they're the ones who find the gold? - Once they do, we'll be there. I put a high frequency locator in Santo's car so we can secretly follow him. But remember, zero guns this time. I want to peacefully enjoy that treasure, without the police on my back, for the death of those two jokers. (light ominous music) - Here we are. You ready? - Does it matter? (grunting) - Do you believe the treasure is real? And if so, will they find it? (birds chirping) - I wish I didn't only believe it, but to be sure of it, but I don't know. (grunting) (gentle ominous music) (door creaking) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (grunting) - I already took out all of my children's toys. Come with me and you can have them all. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (door creaking) (door creaking) (door banging) (gasping) (ominous music) - Where are the toys? - Through here. Do you want to go? (ominous music) - They must have gone over there, let's go. (ominous music) - This grave could contain the treasure. Let's open it up. - As you wish. Since I became your official stone carrier. (grunting) (chimes ringing) (steady music) - Will you really give them all to me? - Yes, they are all yours. But, I want something in return. - Something, like what? - Something like that pretty cross hanging on your neck. - My cross for all of this? - Yes. - Are you kidding? I'll tell my aunts I lost it. (steady music) - Put it there. - Let me go. Your hand is really cold. (eerie music) - Now let's go downstairs. (grunting) (metal clanging) - Holy cow! (ominous music) - This place is very scary. I'm afraid, Juanita. We better go back home. (suspenseful music) Don't be afraid, Juanita. I will protect you. No need to fear. (gentle music) Look at all these fun toys! (intense howling) Who are you, lady? Look, this is Carlitos' cross. (booming) (ominous music) (gasping) I'm glad to see you, ma'am, because I got lost in your house. In the other room, I saw some horrible things. Juanita was really scared. She is my baby doll. - What are you doing with that cross? - It belongs to my brother. - He gave it to me in exchange for these toys. Put it on the table. (gentle music) Come now, sweetheart. I will take you to your brother. (grunting) (metal clanging) (eerie music) - It's the treasure. - Oh man. (grunting) (gentle music) (gasping) - Carlitos. - I will come back with the setting sun. The great Prince of darkness will be witness to my vengeance. - It's the gold Doubloons, Santo! - This is an immense fortune of gold coins. - Ooh, we're gonna have to thank Miss Eugenia later. She's a ghost that keeps her word. - And her threats, too. We must take this today to the Children's Welfare Institute. - Why don't we do it tomorrow? - What for? - To see if Miss Eugenia comes for it, because I haven't seen her, chico. - You've got to be kidding me. - Well, more or less, but... - Come on, let's go. (grunting) - Man, this box is really heavy. I wonder how Miss Eugenia managed to bring it over here. - She was helped by two servants as strong as you and me. (gentle music) - Go! (suspenseful music) (punching) (grunting) (smacking) (thudding) (bottle crashing) (grunting) (thudding) (crashing) (banging) (thudding) (grunting) (smacking) (banging) (wailing) (smacking) (grunting) (crashing) (grunting) (smacking) (crashing) (grunting) - Good job, Mantequilla. Let's go. - Let's go, Santo. - Yes, here you are. (banging) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (smacking) (grunting) (crashing) (grunting) Help, help me. (suspenseful music) (engines rumbling) - Thank you. No one has seen them. I don't know how we could've let them out of our sight. - What do we do, Sonia? What do we do? - We wait for the return of Santo and Mantequilla Napoles. I hope they don't take too long. (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) - The Children's Welfare Institute. (suspenseful music) (grunting) - I'm scared, Carlitos. I'm really scared. We better go home. - Don't be afraid, Martita. Don't be afraid. Nothing will happen to us. (ghostly wailing) (gasping) (intense howling) - I simply can't believe my eyes. Look at all these gold Doubloons. (suspenseful music) (ghostly wailing) (gasping) - The Children's Welfare Institute is grateful to receive through both of you 100,000 gold Doubloons, which will be used in their entirety to save children's lives. (suspenseful music) - Professor Lira told me that by giving away the treasure in order to benefit children in need, the soul of Miss Eugenia will be freed from her Satanic pact. - So as they say, Miss Eugenia simply vanished in thin air. (steady music) - Fortunately, children are quick to forget. - Martita believes everything was a dream. - And I didn't see her. - Who? - Miss Eugenia. - Maybe next time. What next time? She turned into ashes! (laughing) - But I still have the same question. If you two fight, who would win? - The end. (steady music)
