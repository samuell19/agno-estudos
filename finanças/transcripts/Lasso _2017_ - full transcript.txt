Last one? Anybody? Thank you. Can you lock it up? This place smells like shit. Got a second for animal rights? Uh... sure. Right there. Donation? Simon. - Check it out. - I'm sorry. Bondage, forced breeding, branding. For what? - Turn around and go home. - Maybe he's right. You know, these animals probably have a longer life span than the ones bred for food. Okay, we really should get moving. - Please. - Not really my thing. - Compassion's not your thing? - Ooh. Hey! Can't be within a hundred yards of this place. You know that. This is a public road! On private property! This is wrong. And you know it. My apologies. - Pomroy Hackett. - Kit. - Nice to meet you, Kit. - This is Simon. This is the rest of the gang.

Oh, the same friends that left you behind? - It wasn't on purpose. - How do you know? Look, my supervisor is gonna call someone. Trust me. I say we wait. Whoever is coming has to take that road. If they're even coming at all. - I say we get out of here. - I'm with you. - No. - Listen, listen... No. We stay together. Okay? That's it. We wait. Okay, but you better be right. Okay. Come on. Kit. Kit! I can't. - Oh, no. - I can't. We gotta keep moving. I can't. It's all my fault. We cannot do this now. If you've got a job to do, you finish it. Right. Right. Is that... Is that the dog?

What do you do normally? Like for work? I do this. Guess you could call it "being pretty for a living." You do a great job. What about you? Student? How'd you know? What are you studying to be? I have no idea. Would you ever wanna do anything? With me. Like y-you and me. Uh... If-If-If we get out of this. - Sure. - Really? Simon, if you get me out of here, and I will do anything you want. Guys. Dear God. They're all dead. Those are your friends? The ones that were gonna save us? I'm sorry, Simon. I really am. So no one's coming? Now what? Now what? We have to go. We have to go. Now. Come on. Come on. Okay. Come on, boy. Come on. Okay, listen. Here's what we're gonna do. You guys ride out. I'll check the other stables for a horse and catch up. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - No. We should go together. - No! No. We're better off in numbers. Go. We're waiting. Trust me. It's gonna be okay. Simon! Run! Wait! Aah! Aah! Fuck you. He's dead. Oh. All right. Come on. What is going on? Is that Simon? - You're still alive. - Told you I would be. What happened to your arm? Which one? Hey. Where are the others? All dead. Except Trish. They took her. All right. Let's get you out of here. - I'll come back for Trish. - No. I'm coming too. All right, let's move. Well, they had it coming. Keep your head down. Oh, my God. Motherfuckers. We gotta do something. There's too many of them to take on straight up. That chain link fence keeps them all locked inside, doesn't it? We got a generator right here. All right, what we're gonna do, we're gonna charge this fence - with every damn volt in that machine, you hear me? - Okay. We charge all four side of this. Yeah. We wait till they all get inside before we power up that gennie. Then we're gonna get Trish out of there. - You think it'll work? - It's gonna have to work. It's gonna zap those fuckers like a bug machine. Hurry up. Okay. Come on. Where's your partner? All right, we got three walls wired. There's only one left. There's not enough to make it to the last wall. Okay. Find the gennie on this side. Plug it in, you connect everything. All right? On my signal, you charge your side, I'm gonna charge mine. Just make sure you charge that final one, you understand me? But that means I'm gonna be by myself. That's right. Son, it's gonna be all right. No, I don't think that's a good idea. I can't. Want to know how I lost my arm? You want to know that? Yeah, tell me. Never had it. I was born without it. - I'm sorry. - Nah. Nah, don't be. Can't be missing something you ain't never had. Hear me when I tell you this. It ain't about what you come into this life with. It's what you choose to do with it. You understand me, son? I want to... I want to thank you for, you know... It's okay. I get it. Go find that gennie. Where's your partner? Hey! There you go. Okay. All of you guys are sick! No! You're sick! You bastard. No! No. Hurry up! Yeah. Go. Let's get this show on the road. Come on. Now. Get out! Get out! Oh, my God. Are you okay? You okay? Shut up! - Don't look at me! - Oh! Okay. Good luck, son. What? Come on. Move! Hey, dickless!

Come on then. Screw you! What? Damn it! You're dead! Come on, come on. Can't you just die already? Damn. Please! Damn. No. Motherfucker. Simon. What? Simon... No! Simon! Come on. Are you okay?
