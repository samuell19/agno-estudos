[Sita and Rama Marriage] 42... 44... - What is this? I told you to study during exams. But you were going around temples. Now that the results are expected, are you going around Basil plant? 45... Are you her umpire? - Calculator. Shit! Hey! Will you not speak? Hello! She will not speak till the results are declared. Why? - Today is mute day! Don't you know 'mute'? Full silence. She has vowed to remain silent the whole day. Is it?! - Yes. Your English is horrible! She can't speak in English. That is why her stomach is burning with jealousy. Acidity! Hey! Come here. No use of telling you. It is because of your father who supports whatever you do. Where is he? Dear Daughter! Do not worry. I have prayed to God. You will surely pass in 1st class. Her passing the exam is doubtful. But you say she will get 1st class! Father and daughter behave the same way. O My Son! - Mom. Put some more camphor. She will get more marks. Oh! Definitely. Definitely. Take blessings. Are you all joking? I have never seen her studying. How will she Pass? In the same way she passed all these years. - Yes. Let me see. What about result? It was announced two hours back. I am asking about my daughter's result. As recommended by you, I have cleared her result in 1st Class. My dear Daughter! You have passed in 1st class. Really! How is it possible? We always win. I know it is Match-fixing. Look! Your father is there to help you now. But some day a man will come to teach you a lesson. Then you will realize. Father! Did you hear her? My father will get a husband for me. I will watch whether he will pamper you or discipline you. Father! Do I need a Mother?! Don't you want? If you agree, shall I search a new Mother from the matrimonial column? Of course. You may search. I am also fed up of seeing the same face all these years. Hello! Do you think you deserve a 2nd marriage? Are you trying to get a 2nd wife for my husband? Give the stick. I will surely get... Give the stick. - Run... Brother! Stop fighting. It is time to go for marriage. We are late. Brother-in-law has come. - Finally he has arrived. Greetings! - Greetings! Brother! Sister-in-law! Are you fine? Yes. We are fine. The marriage hall is bubbling after your arrival. I will attend only the main function. You and your sister can look after the other things. Please come. - Welcome. The arrangements are excellent! Not bad... Oh! English Grandma! So Nice to see you. Namaste! OMG! It is very difficult to manage Sari. Do not get so exit! It is 'excite'. - I know. Your Sari falls every few seconds like a traffic signal. How? You first pin it up. Sorry! I forgot. Naughty Grandma! I feel so shy. Instead of wearing Sari properly she is covering her face. Stupid girl! - Grandma! Have juice. I will serve juice. You go. Take. Mother! Have juice. Thanks. You may go. By the by... Where is our enemy? Yes... Where is our enemy? She has come. Look there! Pumpkin! Hey bride! How are you? I am fine. I think you will also be fine. She also seems fine. I heard some news. Oh! Wind news?! - No. Air news. Proceed. Heard she has passed in 1st class this time also. Yes. Just as Kohli hits century every time I also get 1st class every time. I am always a topper. You are just lucky! Stomach burning? It is because she scores only pass marks! I may be an average student. But my selection is top class. My husband is foreign-returned. He is like a Prince. Understand? That is why my father is celebrating the marriage in a grand scale. Isn't it? - Of course. Do not be proud. I will select an excellent husband for my grand-daughter. Her husband will arrive in grand style. He will make the celestial being blow the trumpet. Send message through the clouds. He will come like a shining star. Will arrive with rage like wind. Please tell him not to hit us. We will never spoil your land again. Forgive us. Please forgive. Kethaka. We will never hit you. Please spare us. Okay. We will not spoil your land. We were wrong. Instead of asking for forgiveness, mend the farm. We should do our work. Get the spade. - You are right. Which is your native? Bengaluru. Though city bred, you are doing farming work better than us. A tree may grow very tall but its roots are fixed to the ground. In the same way, wherever we go, our genesis is here. I learnt to love land from my grandfather. Learnt to love people from my father. And learnt to do work perfectly from elders like you. You speak well. Thank you for helping us. This world is full of selfish people. But Farmers like you, work hard for others. You should fold hands only for Mother Earth. Just bless me wholeheartedly. May God Bless you! - May you lead a good life! May God bless you! The groom has arrived! Play music. Wow! Namaste! - Hi! You drive very well! You also look handsome. - Thank you. I like your attitude. The groom is good looking. Isn't it? Hello! Hey Arya! Hi Uncle! Hi Aunt! - Hi! Why have you come alone? Where is the groom? He is here... Oh! There... Look at my husband. He is like a Prince. Are you showing off before your bride? I fell down on the way. But You left me. I was shouting at you to stop. But you came without caring. I got hurt. Father-in-law! A stone hit me when I fell down. Look! Uncle! At least you see if I am bleeding. I have a sensitive skin. I hate you. - Hey get up. Stupid! He is shameless. Mummy! Son-in-law! Please come inside. Send Nayana to apply medicine. You will be fine if you take bath in hot water. Come. It is a new one! Hi! What is the matter? Didn't get Tea or Coffee since morning. I did not ask you. Understood. Continue. You must have heard the name Arya. Many girls have tattooed this name on their body. - Oh! Yes. Your name? Spicy dish made with pulses! Oh! Are you a vegetarian? Only my name is such. But if you interfere in my affairs, I can punch you. Brother! I love it. I heard you saying something about me. That I am very... Bad looking. Did you hear her words? Village girls cannot be enticed so soon. I can do it. Okay sir. Hey Small Robot! She is wearing torn cloth. Still she is good looking. Isn't it so? Guests are waiting. Go and serve Coffee. Okay. Go. - You go. I thought you were enjoying her cuddle. But you got a shock. How was it? - Madam! Oh No! Let us go. She may come. If we marry a handsome guy, all girls will try to woo him. And we should do spy work. But if we marry an average looking guy he will woo us and follow us everywhere. See there! Your Man is following some other girl. See there! Your Man is following some other girl. Some girls are like Pop song. We forget it immediately after hearing. Few other girls are like rap song. People forget it while hearing. But you are like a melodious song which people want to hear always. You are always in memory. Is it?! He is a womanizer! Give a stick. Boss! Did I tell the dialogue properly? Turn the other side. Hear what I say. Why are you following me? You did not tell your name. Tell your name. Why should I tell? Give me a stick. I want to hit him. She says she will not say. Shut up. Ask her again. Calm down. Please tell your name. No. Shameless fellow! She doesn't want to tell. Still he is after her. Say that you will not marry if she doesn't tell. Tell. If you do not tell your name now, I will not marry. He is a flirt! I cannot bear to see this. Take me. Please take me from here. I am not bothered whether you marry or not. Get lost. Hey! - She cursed me. Bro! Bro! I am confused. Why should I interfere in your affairs? You can speak to her. Nobody will mistake if you ask because you are the groom. But people will mistake me if I ask. I am right. Isn't it? If Nayana knows that I am helping you, she will appreciate me. Correct. Show that color... That one... It is nice. Isn't it? It is very nice, Geetha. It is not nice. I do not want it. - Of course It is nice. Hey Geetha! You wanted to see the village. Come. Okay. Let us go. Things are not working out properly here. Let us go. Let us go to the mountain peak. - Stop! What is the matter? Who is the groom? You or Me?! Of Course You. Who should be the centre of attraction? You... But if you go round with your biceps everyone will look at you only. Who will see me? I will lose my attention, You know. Attention gets value only if there is competition. I mean... You are also good looking. You have a great physique. Really! - Yes. Use them. Show your biceps. Show you sexy thighs. I feel shy. No need to feel shy. Try to understand. Attention seeking is important. Is it? Come here. If you show off your strength before marriage your wife will be under your control afterwards. Isn't it? - Yes. You have made me realize. Wait and watch. I will go around in underwear the whole of this place. Is it? - Yes. Turn right. What are you looking at? Fool. Thighs... - Thanks. It is great. Let us go. - Nonsense. Sexy thighs! Look at my thighs. I did it. I have got six packs chest. Stupid! Why are you roaming like this? It is the trend now. - Trend? - Yes. Fool! Go and wear proper clothes. Generation gap. You will not understand the pulse of youth like us. Old models. Ouch! Oh Sorry. It is okay. No problem. Wow! Do you like it? - Yes, Of Course. Can I touch it? Please... Cool... - This side... Amazing. How did you get it? Daily 200 Push-ups and 100 biceps. Now I am going for my thighs work out. So nice! My thighs! You naughty! Can I meet you later? - Why? To do exercise. - Okay. Naughty. Hey Baby! Let us do Push-ups. Is it? - Yes. I will teach you Karate and Kung Fu later. - Okay. You flirt! Come. Flirt! What did I do? I came to show you our village. But you have driven so far. Stop! My grandfather...! See there. Ranganna! Ranganna! Ranganna! Grandpa! Grandpa! Why did you do look this? Ranganna is a farmer. So what? A farmer ends up dying. Death! What do you mean? We take loans for doing agriculture. But no rains since 3 years and so no Produce. Banks send us notice repeatedly. Unable to bear the insult, every farmer takes this decision. Death is not the end to everything. Do not cry, My child. I have some money. Keep this. I will repay your loan. I do not want. Do not hesitate. You will clear the debt this year. But what about next year. If there are no rains, we will be left to the same fate. What is the remedy to this? Water. Our difficulties will be solved only on the day when we get water without having to depend on rains. If we get water properly, we can produce food grains twice a year. Then nobody has to give loan to a farmer. Farmer will earn and clear the debt of this country. Lift him. Please come, Sir. Sir! Your time was good. He came and rescued you. Please take. See you. Madam! Don't scream. They are seeing you secretly while you are wearing sari. You should close the door and wear sari. He is right. How can she complain when she is dressing up with doors open? Yes. Shameless fellows! How dare you teach me morality? Get lost. Get lost. O God! - Idiots. Did they see everything? Of Course. You? - I did not see anything. Then come later. Later? Why? Naughty fellow! Look how he is staring. Staring?! Baby! Did I woo her? Come later. Let us go. She is also telling me to come later. It is confusing. Nobody told the time. Brother! - Yes. Calling you for taking food. - Coming. She looks so beautiful in this photo. Isn't it? - Yes. Geetha! When was this photo taken? This is also nice. When was this photo taken? Hey! Is it alright? It is difficult to overtake this lady. Madam! - Get lost. You are old and fat. Hey Fatty! What did you say? - Hey Fatty! - Go away. He is calling me fat. Geeta! Eat this. For me? I will give you also. Eat. I am sorry. Get lost. You...! Hey! He is always looking at my mole. He looked at my mole thrice. Tit for tat. What do you mean? Shall we see him secretly when he is bathing? Shut up. Don't you feel ashamed? The boy is handsome. That is why I said. What shall we do then? We have to use our boys to teach him a lesson. We want Thousand rupees. Okay. Who is the target? - Arya. Not possible. - Why? If we fight with him, he will kill us. Okay then. I will give Five thousand rupees. Five thousand rupees! I am reminded of my lost sister when I see you. I will do the job even at the cost of my life. This is a brother's promise. You also promise. - Your younger brother's promise! Are you sleeping here? Wait. Why have you come now? I cannot sleep in my room. Shall I sleep next to you? No. I will not sleep next to you. You will put your legs on me. You sleep here. I will sleep in your room. Thanks. Sleep next to me. - Shut up and lie down. He is the one. He has covered his face with blanket. You go. Hey! - Lie down. Come. Let us run. Someone is hitting me. I am scared. I will go to my room. What happened? - Success. We have thrashed him. Did you beat him properly? We beat him black and blue. Give me a high five! Hey! What are you doing? That... - I want silence. Very good. Why did I get scared of him? I think these boys did not beat him. Stop it. Can't you do a work properly? Is it a Government job to do with care? You asked us to beat a person. - You! It is not our problem. - Then whose? Navigation. Navigation?! - Yes. She mistook the person to be someone else. Who did you show to them? - Who did you show to them? I showed the right person. Okay. You should not miss this time. Should not miss this time. Should not miss. Are you here? Bro! Bro! Why did you come back here? Move aside. I will also sleep here. I am scared to sleep there alone. - Get out. Please... Okay. You sleep. Do not come searching for me again. Okay. Sleep. You also sleep here. Okay. I will sleep alone. He should not come to me again. He is sleeping there. - Okay. Go. Hey! Who is that? Come directly and hit me. I will cry if I get angry. He will not get up again. What happened? We have flogged him. He cannot get up. Come here. For me? Will you not give me? Oh! Why did you slap me? He is roaming around. Are you lying? You have to beat him in front of me. Go now. Quiet. - Careful. Quiet. Run! He looks so strong! What are you doing here? Security... - We are guarding the place. Inside the house?! Special duty. - Even for me. I suspect these two. Why do you suspect us? We promise. Special duty for us. Yes. For me also. Give that. Turn right. - That... Walk. Special duty? Where did you learn this? Is it nice? - Super. Geetha! - Yes. Come fast. Come and sit. - What Grandma? Look! He has drawn beautiful designs. You also get it done. I don't want. - Sit. Get it done. You draw. Why is he not seeing? Can't he see it? Is he acting? Someone stop the fan. It is disturbing me. Sorry. Please... I was scared that this day will surely come. Still I cannot bear this. Hello! Uncle! What is this? You celebrated the marriage happily. But crying like a small child now. She grew up in my heart. But now she is going to live in somebody else's house. Will I not feel the pain? Why Sir? Hasn't Aunt left her mother's house and come? Hasn't your Mother left her maternal house? This relationship cannot be forgotten. She is just going out of your house. Not from your heart. While going to husband's house every girl will have some unknown fear. Parents should overcome her fear and give her strength. Bless her that she should get the same happiness that she got in her maternal house at her in-law's place also. A girl's strength lies in her endurance to face things. Explain that to her. Your words are blessings to her. Your laughter is her strength. Go and live happily. Superb. You spoke so well. Though you are younger to us, you spoke better than us. A marriage hall is like a place of mourning at this time. But you taught us the responsibility of parents at this time. I am proud of your parents who have brought you up with culture. Which place do you belong to? Bengaluru. My visiting card. Oh! N.K. Constructions. I have heard about it. May God bless you! Sir! Boss started drinking more after you left for Village. Aarya! You never drink. Why are you drinking now? Dad! I gave you permission to drink just one peg. I told you to have a light drink. But you are drinking too much. I was upset that you are not here. So I drank more. Okay... I have stopped. I love you. I love you, My son. I have no one other than you. Even I do not have anyone other than you. Stop this drama. I have arrived. Why do you need this now? Okay. Don't want. Let us go to sleep. Come. Good Morning. - Good Morning, Sir. So...Let's begin the day. Sir! Government has called for tender for Airport and Highway. Among these two projects, I think Airport is a better project. No... No... I think Highway is a better option. Because we have experience in that. Why don't we take it as a challenge? Our Company profile will become bigger if we take up the Airport project But we will get more profit in Highway. You don't know the profit in Airport. Exactly. I support Airport project. I do Sir. - Even I. I will still suggest for Highway, Sir. Me too... - Me too... Sir! Decision is yours. Please take a call. Good Morning Sir! - Good Morning. Good Morning. Thank you. - We are discussing whether to take up Airport or Highway project. What is your choice? Dam. Yes Sir. But... Why Dam? Karnataka already has KRS, Tungabhadra, Linganamakki... Yes. Almatti, Harangi, Hemavathi, Kodasalli. Vanivilas, Shanthisagara, Basavasagara Renukasagara... Haridra, Rajalakshmana Gowda, Kandwa, Kadra, Bhadra, Supa... Totally there are 17 major dams. But I have a proposal to Government to give this dam to plain region. But why? - Life savior. Life savior! For whom? Farmers. But why? When we talk of great inventors we speak about those who invented aircraft, electricity etc. But according to me, great inventors are the farmers who grow food grains. Farmer is the first Scientist. Without food, there will be no invention. But our Company will not get any profit from this. Of course we are doing business and money making is our intention. We cannot expect to get profit from every business that we do. Every person who eats food is indebted to its supplier. If he commits suicide because of difficulties, we all will die. Now their situation is very precarious. Because of the dam we are going to construct the lives of millions of farmers, who depend on rain water to grow even one produce, will change. Their land will get water throughout the year. If there is water, there will be produce. If there is good produce there will be farmers. If farmers are there, Country will also thrive. And I have all the required documents for that. Hello! Government has given permission to build dam in the place where we had made a deal with Malaysian Company to build a Chemical factory. If I try to stall it using my power, media will create controversy. So you handle it. Okay Boss. The project is blocked. It has to be completed... This is my visiting card. Instead of constructing roads and relaxing in AC room do you want to construct dam and improve the lives of farmers in the place where we have planned to build a Chemical factory? I lack both decency and patience. If you oppose me I will not send you to Doctor with minor injuries. I will send you direct to God. I think you are scared. Take care. Who are you? My father's visiting card! A useless fellow like you warned a King sitting in his Assembly. Still he was sitting quiet. You should have understood then that the King has the support of a Prince. If your father a Hero? Father is the Hero for every son. And son is the Hero for every father. I think you are very scared. Take care. I will break your limbs if you do not listen to me. I will not stay here. I am not like your Father to listen to whatever you say. Henceforth you should study in Bengaluru and stay in this hostel. Father! Lakshmi! What does she lack here? This girl is studying in this hostel since 2 years leaving her parents. Look! If you come home without any reason, I will break your leg. Let us stay in Bengaluru for a few days till she gets adjusted. You first come out of this place. You have pampered her a lot. No... - Mother! Mother! Come. I will also come. Hello! Hello... Who is that? Silence. What happened? I am not getting adjusted to this City, Hostel or College. I feel like going back to my native. Initially even I was feeling so. You will get used to it in due course. Come to sleep. You go. I will come later. Okay. What are you thinking about? I was thinking about the dam project. Stop pondering over it. Enjoy your life. It is party time, Man. I feel I have enjoyed a lot in life. Don't you think it is time to get serious? Forget it. You had been to a marriage. Tell me about it. - Hey! Dad! - Come here. Did you like any girl there? I will tell at the appropriate time. At the right time? - Yes. Even I spent my whole life working. I do not remember how I spent your age. I am not upset about it. Because I knew that my son will live the life which I missed. You should feel that you enjoyed your life. Now you enjoy the life which I missed. Every Father advises his son to study and work hard. But you are telling me to enjoy life. You are the world's best father. You are the world's best son. Hey! Not able to see you often after your marriage! Enjoying life? 'My foot! Only I know my difficulties.' Are you fine? - Fine. Thank you. Are you fine? He is my God now. I lead life according to his wish. 'God! - She acts well.' I need a help from you. Ask anything you want. I am prepared to even give up my life. Can you get me Geetha's number? I am sorry. Just now you said that you will give up your life for me! You do not know my wife. She looks like a female but acts like a male. What?! I was mentioning about her character. She is a rowdy. You know... Do not forget that you are a Man. After marrying her I have forgotten that I am a male! Come on! Be a Man. Speak in base voice just once. She will shake with fear. Is it? - Yes. Try it. - Okay. I will try. Hey You! What is it? Nothing. You go. She is eating well and has become fat! Nayana! - What? Give Geetha's number. - Why? To check her caller tune! Why are you bothered? Give. - Okay. Come in. My God! She is fully shaken. If I had known before, I would have spoken in base voice from the beginning. Shake hands. Is this base voice! Hey! Give me her number. You were flirting with girls other than the bride in the marriage. Flirting! What is it?! You stupid fellow! Mummy! Do you want number?! Not for me. For brother. Brother! - Tell me. Did you ask for any number? No... Bro! You... Did she give? - Yes. Then give. What happened? She hit me. She hit me hard like they grind banana in a mixer! Don't feel bad. Your wife only hit you. I will not tell anyone. Please get the number. She was hitting me only at night. But now because of you, she has hit me in the morning. Get lost! Your wife is there! - Mummy! Please get me the number. - I cannot get. What shall I do? Not able to adjust to anything. Shall I call Aarya? Let me try. Please get me the number. Not possible. No. I can't. - Please... Hello! Get her number. - Not possible. Wait a minute... Who is that? Who? You! It is You. Right? Yes. It is Me. It is Me. Did you think about me? I need a favor from you. Okay. Done. No problem. I will do anything for your sake. Give me 2 hours time. I will come to your town. No need to come to my town. - Why? I am now in Bengaluru. Bengaluru! - Yes. Hi Geetha! What a surprise! I did not expect you to call me. I thought you would have forgotten me by now. Thank God! You have my number. I did not expect that we will meet here. You wanted some help from me. What is it? Bike? Yes. Bike. Don't you have Car? Car! - Yes. Do you want to go somewhere? - Yes. Shall we go on bike? - No. 'She is not talking...' Adjusted to College? - Yes. Are you staying in your relative's house? - No. Are you staying in PG? - No. Then you are staying in hostel. - Yes. Speak something. If people see me speaking to myself they will think I am 'Guldu'(slang word). What does 'Guldu' mean? You spoke at least now... Million dollar question. 'Guldu' means Me. Is it?! Shall we go by auto? I have seen couples fondling in auto. But these two are maintaining 2 feet gap. Song problem? Come on! Let us play the music. 'Geetha... Sangeetha...' What a wonderful song! I love you. Thank you. I play such love songs to lovers. Hey! Stop the auto. Stop it I say. Stop it. Why? - Are we lovers?! Don't we look like siblings to you? Why are you speaking in a wrong sense? Wrongly? - Yes. Stupid. I will never travel by auto again. Get lost. Hey Geetha! I will not come. Come near hostel at 10 A.M. tomorrow. Girls have no time sense. She told me to come at 10. It is 10.30 now. Still she has not come. Are you playing with me? Wait... 100% You must be a female ant. Are you maintaining distance from boys? Most probably your name must be Geetha. Bye. Finally you laughed. Shall we go? Madam! You are not ready to travel in auto or bike. And I cannot walk on road with the bike. Please sit. I will not apply brake even if a bulldozer comes in front! I promise! I will tell you if I see any bumps or pits. Please believe me. Friend? - Yes. Friend. Only friend. Yes... Only Friend. 'At least she agreed to sit.' You are sitting with fear like how small children sit on giant wheel. People will mistake us. I will see to it that we do not touch even an inch. Sit comfortably. Okay. Day before yesterday she said we are like siblings. Then she said we are friends. After that 'Girlfriend'. Then 'Wife'. After that it is 'Knife'. Why are you discouraging me? Keep quiet. You still do not know above wives. If I get hair on food and question her about it she says it might have flown due to wind and advises me to remove it and eat silently. At the same time, if she sees a long hair on my shirt she starts abusing me. We have no excuses. She is torturing me. I think wives are born to torture us. If I become Prime Minister I will ban the concept of 'wife'. Please. Do not speak cheaply about wife. A girl holds an important position in family. Have you not heard this song? "If you have a wife at home..." Stop. When? - Long back. Is it? - Yes. What a good friend you are?! Thank you. Shall I leave? Bye, Madam. - Okay. Thank you. Bye Bro. - Enjoy. Baby! Baby! What is it? Look at the star there. Is it? Where? Here. We farmers consider Land as our life. Our life will brighten because of the dam you are going to construct. You are like God to us. May God bless you! You are praising us a lot. It is my duty. I just want to do some good to farmers. Any kind of work in Dam area will be looked after by Arun. Minister has been calling you repeatedly. He has called many times. It is better if you receive. What shall I tell him? Should I say that we were thrashed? We should not spare the persons responsible for this. I will definitely stop the construction of the dam. Till now that project was of the Minister. It is mine from now. Make a plan to attack him. It is a surprise! You have come to Bangalore without informing. I felt like seeing my daughter. So I came. You could have come to the factory. You are there to take care of that. Jeeva! - Yes Sir. Go to the temple. Okay Sir. - Temple! Yes. I called Geetha. She is there. I want to surprise her. Which temple? - It is... What did you do?! I am sorry. I missed. - Hey, loafer. Can't you see? - Are you scolding me? Yes. Shut up and get down. Listen to me. Jeeva! Can't you see? You have hit a parked car. Why are you fighting? Come back. Sir! Just a minute. Hey! What nonsense are you talking? Where are you going? I will come now. Hey Jeeva! Keep quiet. He hit my auto. Jeeva! - Vishwa! I am telling you. - Ravi. He hit my auto. Geetha! Hey Geetha! - What? What is all this? - Stop... It is festival. Very nice. Will you take a photo? Shout. Take off your hand. Don't you know I do not like such things? - I am Sorry. Why did you keep your hand on me? I do not want any explanation. Give the phone. I have to delete the photo. Give phone. Will you not give? Give phone. Do not come near. Stand far. I will delete the photo and give you back. Only my photos are there in your phone. When did you click these? Why should you keep my photo? It is just casual. Why have you kept it if it is just casual? Does it mean you love me? Alas! You told you were my friend. But cheated me. You are a cheater. Why did you do like this? You were saying that you are my friend but betrayed me. I never thought that you will do like this. Hey! Do not touch me. Get lost! Geetha! Geetha! Geetha! Geetha! Do not be scared. She will not be harmed. We will take care of her. Go and destroy that demon. Lord Rama was not there when Ravana touched Sita. So Ravana was not killed there. Today, Are you touching Sita in the presence of Rama? Stop it! You are a cheat. Are you trying to murder someone now? She is okay now. You can take her. Thank you, Doctor. - Welcome. Receive the call. You go. Okay. Hi Dad! What happened? You look disturbed since 2 days. Nothing... Dad! What happened? As usual. Are you sure? Nothing serious. I will say at the right time. Ramanna was telling me that you have not been eating food at home since 2 days. What happened to you? Nothing. Just office tension. Are you sure? Yes. Every morsel of grain we eat is decided by God. But it is wife who decides the type of food we eat. So do not oppose wife. Wow! Super dialogue. If I get the capacity to control my wife after reading this book I will make a wig for you out of a wild animal's hair. 'How to pacify your angry wife?' This is what I need. Just kiss your wife when she is angry. Her anger will subside immediately. Super idea. Hey! What? - Where is Mother? My mother died 2 years back. Are you showing your sense of humor because you are in good mood? I enquired about my wife. It has been 2 hours since she went up. Is it?! - To the terrace. Are you joking? Stop your comedy and work properly. Otherwise I will throw you out. Why are you laughing? I am already standing outside. Punch dialogue! Wait. I will fix you during lunch hour. Baby! Today I will give you a sweet baby! How is my perfume? It smells good. Isn't it? Hey! Are you there?! Then who is this? I had a doubt when I hugged you. Still you hugged her? What I mean is... You flirt like this when I am here. I can imagine how you will behave if I am not there... Baby! Just shut up. What are you talking? Why will I touch her when I have a beautiful wife like you? You say. - How dare you? Help! Namaste! How come you are here? We have brought food. Why did you take the trouble of bringing this? You are all working so hard to alleviate the problems of farmers like us. Nothing wrong in bringing food for you. We have brought food for everyone. Give food for all of them. - Have food. Listen to me. Call Aarya. Call him. Geetha! Aarya! What happened? Father is not well. - Is it?! Hey! Stop. Where are you going? - See you. Bye. Why? Will you not come? No. People will mistake if I come. You go. Why will they mistake? You are my friend. She has started the same thing again. What? - Yes. Friend... Shall I go? Bye. Start. What happened? Why are you crying? I fainted because of low BP. Baby! Don't fry. It is 'cry'. - I know. Geetha! Who told you that father is not well? Grandma! I thought my son will recover if he looks at his daughter's face. So I called him. Look at him. How shining? How did you come? Sister! Why are you irritating her by asking such questions? You said your BP became low. What happened to you? He is depressed since few days. He is upset since returning from Bangalore. What happened? Tell me. That... Nothing happened. Brother-in-law is tired He will be fine if he takes rest for few days. Why are you making this a serious issue? Go and do your work. All of you go. Do not get tensed. You go. Go and take rest. Mummy... How did this... Will you not ask how this happened? Wife slipped and fell down from bike when she was travelling with her husband. Poor lady! I am worried about the wife's condition. Her husband will take care of her. You worry about me. My hand got fractured. Will you not ask how this happened? If I ask you will lie that you slipped in the bathroom. Right? No. I will tell the truth. Okay. Tell. - My wife hit me. When did your wife become so strong?! She was the only person to hit me. She only punched my face. Then who did this? Our house maid. Why did she hit you? I hugged our maid mistaking her to be my wife. Couldn't you differentiate between wife and maid after hugging? I realized. But I thought my wife has become better. You deserve this. Sister! Your husband says that the maid is better looking. Better change the maid soon. She will kill me! Where is the book? See you. I am going to Bangalore. We are searching a groom for you. I will marry the boy whom my father chooses. I want to tell you something. Why don't you find a boy for you? You...! Bye! - Bye! You said you have exam. Instead of studying in hostel why have you come to temple? Don't you know that we have to fulfill our prayers if we have to pass the exam? Again to a temple! This is the last temple. What happened? Do you feel tired? - Yes. Why are you crying? I do not have strength to climb the stairs. I will fail. I am unable to fulfill my prayers. - Keep quiet. What shall I do? I will fail. Listen. Pray to God that this lamp should not extinguish. Why? You pray. I will tell you. O God! The lamp should not extinguish. Please... It has extinguished. I will surely fail this time. Pray once more. Once more? - Pray. O God! Please... The lamp should not extinguish. Please... It has not extinguished! Kalaam did not become a renowned Scientist by praying to Saraswathi, Goddess of learning. Ambani did not become rich by praying to Lakshmi Goddess of Wealth. I am not able to understand. I am putting in my efforts by covering the lamp with my hands. The result is that the lamp is not getting extinguished. We should put in efforts. If everyone burdens God without making any effort what will God do? Which God will appreciate if we expect everything from Him without making any efforts? Look! You study. Then write the exam. Leave the rest to God. I have to go to hostel. Why? Take me to hostel. Why? Did I speak anything wrong? I want to study. Is it proper if everyone burdens God with his problems? We should also make efforts. Right? I have written the exam. For the 1st time. What?! Shankar sir has deceived us. Why did he do like this? He has cheated us. I curse that he will never flourish. Wait! All of you wait. Do not create tension. Mr Shankar! We have Court summons for you. We are arresting you. Do not strike a pose. You wanted to take away the farmers land to build a chemical factory here. Right? I have the file where you have signed that you will be building a chemical factory here. Signature! It is a fake one. - Do not act. You tricked them that you are constructing a dam here and took their lands. You have destroyed the livelihood of the farmers. Sir! We thought you are God who has come to improve our lives. So we gave away our lands to you. But you betrayed us. You... No...! This land belonged to our forefathers and we worship this. But you lied that you will get water and improve the cultivation. You have hurt us. You will be destroyed! Who is that? Attack him. Kill him. Come. Come here. You scoundrel. What happened? Tell the truth. He will not talk. He has betrayed his employers. I will tell you the truth. Is this true? Say. Tell the truth. I was greedy. So I connived with Lawyer and Police and committed mistake. Please forgive me. You sinner! No! Stop it. Stop! Stop! Stop! My father can do lots of business if his intention is only to make money. But he wanted to help the farmers and desired that you get water throughout the year. So he didn't hesitate to start this dam project when I presented this idea to him. He did not care for profit and spent his earnings for this project. My father is a Samaritan who registered his personal property to your names because you will not feel the loss of your lands. But you blame such a person as cheat. My father is not a betrayer. He will give up his life for those who believe him. Even if he is insulted like this he is so magnanimous that he will live for the farmers till his last breath. He is a divine person who cares for everyone. Such is my father. Call Advocate Kulkarni and tell him to handle these legal issues. These legal problems are common for Construction companies like ours. Why is he disconnecting my call? Wait and see. But we are building this dam project for the 1st time. We have purchased land from farmers legally. This is not a problem for villagers. I think the Minister is behind these problems. Let us not talk about the Minister. Our focus now should be on... - Hello! I am in an important meeting. Will call you later. Listen... This project is very prestigious for our Company. Are you disconnecting while I am talking? Just see what I will do. Already there is news in market that this project is delayed. But we should complete this project fast. Aarya! - Dad. Speak. I am sorry. What is the matter? Why are you screaming? Okay... Tell me. What is the matter? - I am near the hostel. Come now. Come fast. Let him come. I will yell at him! Will you come or not? - Hello! It is Me Father! I will call you later if you are busy now. What is the matter? - Nothing. We are discussing about your marriage with your aunt's son Chandan. I called to know your opinion. Why are you silent? Marriage! Only if you wish. I need some time. I will call you later. Okay. She needs time. I will talk to her. Okay. - Okay Vishwa! What is the matter? Why are you asking angrily? Why did you call me? Nothing. - What?! I was in an important meeting with Father. I left in mid-way and have come here. Do you mean your Father is more important to you than me? What nonsense are you talking? Is your Father not important to you? In the same way my father is important to me. Look! Do not talk about my father. Your father and my father are of different type. Do not speak like an insane person. Am I talking like a mad person?! Are you calling me mad? Okay. Forget it. Now tell me the matter. Nothing. What do you mean?! Nothing. Then did you call me for fun? Speak. Tell something. I am going to my native place. Why? My family has selected a groom for me. That is why. Did you agree? Shouldn't I agree? Why should you agree? Should I not agree to marry the groom selected by my father? Why should I take permission from you? Who are you to me? Who am I?! You thought about me when you didn't have anyone here. Ask that. It will answer who I am. You thought you will be safe with me wherever you go. Ask your mind. That will say who I am. I just thought of you as a friend. Nothing else. You are not a small child. Both of us know our feelings towards each other. What is there between us? What special is there? Then... Are we not friends? Started your drama again... Are you cheating me after calling me your friend? You are a cheater. - Are you insulting me? Are you teasing me? You mistook when I held your shoulders in the bike and hugged you in front of exam hall. Are you taking advantage of that? I didn't know you have such cheap mentality. Stop it. I am not cheap. But you are. I am a straight forward person. I will directly tell what I feel. Listen. I love you. I love you. Do not be shocked. I am the only Man who says I hate you the very next moment after saying, that I love you. Yes. I hate you. I hate you. Because I will turn mental if I live with an insane person like you. Thank God! I am saved. The person who marries you will be doomed. What did you say?! Doomed! He is not an ordinary person like you. Extra ordinary. My father will find a Prince as husband for me. Let me also see if you will be happy with that extraordinary Prince or miss living with an ordinary person like me, who will take care of you like a Princess. Get lost. Father! - Tell me. Dear. I agree to this marriage. Ready?! Just now you said you need time. I am saying after thinking over it. I am ready for this marriage. Did you think well? Do you agree? Father! I agree. Okay. I will come there. Come. I will send car. Jyoti! - Yes. Geetha has agreed for this marriage. You are wrong, Geetha. If you take decision in anger, you will have to repent later. Listen to me. You will never get a good boy like Aarya in your life. I know you love Aarya very much. You hold him in your heart. No use even if you go far away from him. Do not destroy your love for the sake of your ego. Please Geetha. Do not go. Geetha! I will marry only the person selected by my father. Geetha! Geetha! Welcome. Father! - Come. I am tired. Let me take some rest. Okay. Go. Sir! - What? Aarya! - Who is he? Yes. Brother-in-law! Father! Who is Aarya? - My friend. No need for that friendship. Why? Once upon a time we were close friends. Well done Shankar. You have got a big project from Government at the start of your career. Congratulations! - Thank you, Ramesh. Wonderful! My soul mate has become an Engineer. Give. Enough. Leave Bangalore and come back. We have lots of property. You can sit and relax. Come back. Let us all live happily together. You have helped me a lot in my life and for studies. If I do not achieve anything, it will be an insult to you. So I have to stay back in Bangalore for some more days. Naughty! Are you staying back to achieve something or you are in love with someone? Nothing of that sort. Ma! He is teasing me. I will select a girl for you and get you married. Promise me. Look how he is dominating me! Both of you are my children. If he is controlling you, you also do. Not only are you going far. You are also distancing my sister Meera from me. Have you started the same thing? Why should I separate brother and sister? Meera wanted to study medicine. She got seat on merit. I gave her permission to study. Is it wrong? I have never stayed without Meera. I have left her in Bangalore because of the only reason that you are there. Do not worry. She is my responsibility. My love is real. Believe me. I have not taken this decision in haste. I am saying only after thinking over it. I will speak to Narasimhan tomorrow. Do not tell now. Let the exams be over. You know that my brother is short-tempered. If he takes me back to native before completion of studies our dreams will be shattered. Okay. I am going to Hyderabad tomorrow. I will return only after few days. You be careful. May you live long! Give for us also. Why are you grim on a festival day? I am reminded of Meera. She is not with us on the festival day. I do not feel cheerful at all. She has gone only for studying. Still you are sad. What will happen to you if she gets married and goes away? Not possible. What do you mean? Will you not perform her marriage? Of course I will. But I will find out a good groom from our family and perform marriage. Even after marriage, Meera should be here, with me. From where will you get such a groom? Don't we have such a boy in our house? Ramesh Sir! Work honestly. Do not betray your employers. Namaste! - Come. February accounts are there in this book. You go. He is thinking of some other thing. No Madam Let him see once. Have you seen? - Yes. Your name signifies Trust. You may go. Okay. See you. Jyoti! Who is it? Meera? - Yes. Give. Meera! - How are you? Are you all fine? - Yes. We are fine. But you have forgotten everybody. It has been many months since I saw you. I will come to see you tomorrow No, Brother. - Why? I am not in Bangalore now. - Is it?! I am outside, in a camp. When will you come to our place? I have to travel from one place to another during camp. I cannot assure you when I will come. It may take 3-4 months to get over. What?! 3-4 months more? Yes. I will come directly there once it is over. Okay. At least call me often. Okay Brother. Congratulations! I saw the reports. You are now 3 months pregnant. Right? Madam! This boy's name is Abhi. He is a Doctor. He will be suitable for your sister-in-law. What is happening here? Meera's and this boy's horoscope match very well. Who told you to select a groom for Meera? He is a Doctor... Who said? He? - Yes. Sir! Please get up. You may go. Why? - Please go. He is a good boy. I will not get my sister married to an outsider. He is a Doctor. - Not possible. I will find out a good boy from our family and get her married. Where will you get such a trustworthy boy? I will surely get. Money received after selling cocoanuts. You may count. Not now. You go. I have to do loading. That is why... You go now. Vishwa! Stop working in our house from now. You have worked a lot. Why? Have I done anything wrong? Do not come for work. Please do not say so. I will not leave this house even if you kick me out. I will be always your servant. Do not say so. You are not our servant from now. You belong to our house. - I can't understand. My sister Meera and you will get married. Sir! - Yes. He grew up in our house. He is the suitable husband for Meera. Come. It is better if you meet Meera once and speak to her. That is wrong. What is this? Narasimhan has propagated that you are Meera's husband. Shall we go and meet her without his knowledge? Bro! She is not in the hostel. She has not reached the hostel still. What does it mean? Where did she go? Someone has come in auto. Come. Meera! Vishwa! You here? What is this? Please do not tell my brother. Please do not tell this matter. Call you at 10 tomorrow. Sir! Sir! - Vishwa! What happened? Sir! Meera... Meera? Shankara... Shankara? Both of them have eloped. Hey! Sir! Meera is my sister. She will never defame me. Shankara is my soul mate. He will not betray me. I have grown up in your house. If you think I am lying, you may cut my tongue. Sir! Meera is pregnant. What did you say?! Call the hostel and ask if you do not believe me. Call the hostel and ask. She has cheated us. Is Meera pregnant? Don't you know that Meera has married Shankar?! What is this? I could not keep up my word. Please forgive me. Why are you feeling bad? You are not at fault. I will never leave you under any circumstance. Even now I am telling you. I will marry your sister. What are you saying? If you agree, I will marry your sister even now. Vishwa! He is a true friend. Do you want to have friendship with a betrayer? I was listening to you all these days At least this time you listen to me. No need for that friendship. Geetha! Do you love Aarya? Do not marry someone else when you love a person. Do not agree now and then spoil the family honor later because you want to live with that person. Geetha! Stop. My father built a fort of love for me in childhood... Made me a Princess of that fort... Was serving me like a servant... gave me whatever I wished for and found his happiness in my happiness. No boy can give a girl such affection. Of Course I said I love him. But how did you think that I will go after him? My father loved me even before I started calling him my father. I cannot cause him pain. If I do, there is no purpose in my life. I have been telling from the beginning and even now. I will marry the boy chosen by my father for me. Grandma! You have been telling that my husband will be like a Prince. Isn't it? It is a lie. Nobody can become a Prince or be like Lord Rama as soon as he is born. It will be known only after seeing the way he looks after his wife. Life is not about marrying the person we love. We should sacrifice our life for the sake of the person who loves us. That is life. Aarya! Dad! Let us go and bring Geetha. How did you know about Geetha? I had hid a truth from you all these years. I have to tell that to you today. Geetha! Where is Geetha? Sir! Geetha is missing. Geetha! - Search for her. Look there. - Geetha! What happened? A person betrayed us 28 years back. Today the same person and his son have kidnapped Geetha. Where is he? Where are you? Come out. Come. Are you tired? Shall I tell something? I did not kidnap your daughter. You see for yourself. Are you surprised? They have taken this decision because they know a truth. Do you also want to know that truth? My love is true. Brother! It is true that I love Shankar. Shankar! Yes. His name is also Shankar, like you. Dr Shankar. Sir! Accounts are not tallying. I fear that we will be caught. See how I will adjust the accounts. I will find out a good boy for her and get her married. From where will you get such a groom? Don't we have such a boy in our house? Ramesh Sir! Work honestly. Do not betray your employers. February accounts are there in this book. Your name signifies Trust. You may go. What?! 3-4 months more? Yes. Okay. At least call often. Okay. You are now 3 months pregnant. Right? What shall we do? I want this child. Hello! Hello! Is Meera there? Yes. She is here. Wait a minute. I will call her. Hello Brother. Why didn't you call me since so many days? That... Nothing. Hope everything is fine. Yes. - That... You come here after finishing your work. No issues. - Okay. 'Is she in trouble and hiding it from me?' Money got after sale cocoanuts. How much shall we take? I will not get my sister married to an outsider. Watch it. I will change the whole story. I will surely get. Money received after selling cocoanuts. You may count. My sister Meera and you will get married. Sir! - Yes. I made a big mistake. I should have told this matter to Narasimhan before. That... - You keep quiet. Immediately both of you come with me to our native. Sister-in-law is not in hostel. Someone has come in auto. Meera! Vishwa! - What is this?! Please do not tell my brother. Your brother wanted you to get married to me. What nonsense are you talking?! You should become mine. You are a servant in our house. Do you deserve to marry me? I love Dr Shankar. I have got married to him. Excuse me! Stop a minute. Why? Meera will have trouble in packing the luggage alone. I will also go and help her. I am sorry. I was tensed and forgot about it. Never mind. I will go. I will not spare anyone who obstructs me. Meera! Meera! Meera! Be Careful. Meera has forgotten the hostel key. Sir! Turn back towards the hostel. Be careful. Meera! Meera! Meera! Leave me. Meera! Meera! Someone has come. Let us go. Meera! What happened? What happened? - Brother! Shankar. What happened? Who did this to you? Vishwa. - Vishwa! Please save my child. I will surely save. Doctor! Fast. Please tell brother that I made mistake. I will tell. Will he forgive me? He will forgive you. Doctor! Fast. I made mistake. Your brother will forgive you. Please tell brother to forgive me. Sir! We could not save Shankar. We have to perform surgery and take out the baby. 7 months... Premature baby. Meera! Look! He will not survive. People have assembled here. Let us go away. Some unknown persons admitted you here when you met with an accident outside the hospital. It has been 4 weeks since you were admitted. You had gone into trans-coma. Get down. 'If I had told the truth to Narasimhan on that day' 'you would not have become an orphan today.' 'But if I tell the truth now, his sister will become a widow.' 'Let this truth remain with me.' If my tears will make you cry I will never cry again. You should always be smiling. From now, I will live for you. Narasimha! Narasimha! Ma! I will kill her if anyone comes near. Please do not harm my daughter. Please leave her. Please leave her. Chandan! Come. No, Shankar. No! I will kill her. You killed my sister in front of my eyes. He says she is his sister... How could you hit a pregnant girl? He should have lived happily with his parents. But you made him an orphan. You did not allow a sister to ask for pardon from her brother. Will you tell brother to forgive me? I made a mistake on that day. Let it not happen today again. Your daughter... I did not come here for the sake of your daughter. Neither for the sake of my parents. But to say that he is your soul mate who can give up his life for your sake. Shankara!
