Infants with severe malformations are called cyclops. Because of this their chance of survival is minimal. The name is derived from a stem of one-eyed creatures from greek mythology. Besides cyclops there are other forms of malformations, such as Siamese twins. These grave aberrations of the body are caused by air-, water- and ground pollution and by excessive use of medication through the mother and as an effect of nuclear radiation. Since the evolution of mankind our bodies are influenced by various harmful substances. Such pollutants harm the chromosomes and change the human genome. In most cases the severely disabled babies were registered as stillbirths or their birth was hushed up. This served as preservation of the species. However, in the 50ies there was a scientist who attempted to keep those babies alive. For him those babies were a clear sign for the evolution of the human who gears up to the worst pollution to come. He died before closing his research. The few infants he experimented on survived thanks to his research and grew up. Dr. med. Keiichi Takazawa, photo from the year 1957, 63 years old. Died in 1971. Brother? Yes? Who was this man? Was he important? Of course. He was my mentor. He conducted this strange research you're dedicating yourself so passionately, right? He doesn't look like a gynecologist. The research isn't strange at all! Tell me, the photo somehow looks odd! Yes. It's been tampered with. The face's right half is a reflection of its left half. That's why it looks unnatural. Why did he make it like that? He wanted his face left to posterity, but he didn't want to show his face's right half. Why? Why? How is your sister-in-law? - Good! Which month? Deadline is the 15th next month. That far already! Her belly is pretty big, isn't it? Yes, sure. Show me the baby as soon as it's born! It's not an exhibit. Oh how nice! I'd also like to have a baby. Then make one! With whom? With Saito-kun! But we're not together anymore! I'd rather have a baby with you. Stop it! Oh my! I can't procreate a child with you... Of course not! I envy you, Miyuki, you're so unconcerned! Why? I wonder when Cupid's arrow will hit you. Maybe the day after tomorrow? Do you have someone in prospect? Well! Come on, tell me! I leave this to your imagination. Over there! Cool guy! Where? Where? A spring even angels dream of. What's this supposed to mean? Lucky you, Yumiko! You are in full bloom. Do you mean this in a bad way? Not necessarily. Don't say I'm a slut or something! Yumiko, do you think you are one? Oh, I seem to have tripped myself up! Sure looks like it. Which one is it? The one with the hat. Yumiko, it's your birthday this month, no? Yes! Gimme something! Let me think. Why are you asking? Just like that. You are strange. What do you wish for? What? A present. A fantastic man! Nah! No, that was a joke of course! I'll love every present coming from you. Then a Donald-Duck-stuffed animal! Come on! Sorry! Sorry! Are you mad at me? Look at your sweet pout! This isn't helping! Excuse me, please! Sorry, but I have to take the call. Your brother? Yes. Excuse me... Yes please? Ahm... What is it? You are Miyuki Takamori, aren't you? Hey! Skin, muscular tissue, blood and immunoglobulin all fine. No deformed bones. No result in the chromosomes. She is a perfectly normal person. A regular girl. Are you sure? Ahm... This was in her pocket. Whatdoes that mean? What's going on here? Shimura! Yes, Sir! Have you checked her identity? Sure thing! Sonezaki! Why the hack did you mix her up? Dammit! The analysis of Takamari's sister avails to nothing. How dare you concealing your mistake! You knew it from the very start, didn't you? Doesn't play any role for the result. You're saying that now. But I'm an official. A state official even! And now I'm involved in a kidnapping. Don't you get what that means for me? Idiot! Nomura! You don't think you can do better, do you? Don't you defy mel! Take it seriously, you bastard! Did she already wake from anesthesia? The effect didn't last too long with her. It's rare, but it happens. Why are we always pursued by bad luck? What's the matter? She saw us. Miyuki! Brother! Michio Sonezaki. Hello, Takamori speaking. Yes, correct. She's not capable to speak right now. I'll give you a call when she calms down. Thank you very much. Sonezaki! Did you receive an assignment from anyone? Do tell me! Answer me! I'm your employer! What happened, happened. The result stays the same. Takamori! Explain it to me. She shouldn't take cold medicine while she's pregnant. And it's too early for stationary admission. Neither sport nor a walk. She only lays in bed. Unthinkable! How do you explain that? This is abnormal! Nobody would argue about that. Takamori! I saw her clinical record. She's neither dog nor monkey. She's your wife! You're right. Please explain it to me. What do you have in mind? I just can't understand you. I'm a father like anyone else. I just want the best baby possible. You're feeling fine? Yes! Of course! Did someone instruct you? Shouldn't you be sad? Excuse me? Why didn't you do anything? She's normal. Neither do I understand him, nor do I believe in divinipotence oder telepathy... I especially came because they shall be proven. Such phenomena are like the deceitful sermon of new religious forms. Takamori lives longer than the girl. She's not yet aware of her own nature. Which other reason will there be? Hey! It doesn't make sense to still examine someone. What do you mean by that? Whais planning, exceeds our imagination. Maybe he himself doesn't fully apprehend the repercussions. Hmm! What do you think? Is this a dream? No idea. This might be your... Ah, there you are, Miyuki! Why did you leave without us? Sorry! We kept looking for you! May I? We're all here for you! Your brother asked me to take care of you. Think of me, too Just leave it! No, that won't be possible. My brother is strange. He is much too concerned about me. Excuse me? You depend on him! Am I right? I have to take responsibility, you understand? Sorry for the inconvenience! Good girl! In fact it's your fault! Why? You look so unconcerned! But it is strange... What? To see Miyuki with Mariko together. Is it bad? Yes, bad! Sometimes I need some quiet, too. Meaning what? That was a joke! We are afraid that you could take your life out of grief. Like in one of those Schmaltzy movies. No worries! I have good friends. As long as you know that, it's fine. Have a nice evening! See you tomorrow! Long time no see! I never imagined that this could happen. I don't want to hear of it. You could thank me! Miyuki is a normal person. At least she seems to believe it. I do, too. You bother too much. It's not only about me, isn't it? Takamori... In this world not everything goes according to plan. Does it? Only people with similar experiences would agree with you. Your attitude is crazy! Without Dr. Takazawa you wouldn't have survived. You're right. But I didn't want to survive. You wouldn't understand. I only saw the people's ugly side. It's much worse than discrimination itelf, I talk about loneliness. I can't even love myself. Funny, right? You should have believed in this one ideology, only. But you rejected it. Is that so? Ideology... a practical word. Why did you try to save Miyuki? If she had been abducted, she never could have come back. I can't be as coldhearted as you or Takazawa. Your sister's rescue might not have been my decision to make. That's what I thought. Did you meet with Miyuki? Let me tell you one thing: The method of Dr. Takazawa, to adjust the exterior shape into a normal human form with the help of blood and cell tissue, has some weaknesses. What do you mean by that? It is strongly influenced by brain waves and emotions. For example if she was to cross the line through a strong concussion, deep anger, fear or grief the exterior shape will fall back into its original form. How did you find out? That's simple: My old face is back. You only think of yourself! To justify your existence, you want to finish your research. That's all. Don't talk so pompous that you'd devote yourself to human survival. I don't want... anyone to suffer... like me! I'll erase your research! Do you want to kill me? There's more. What else might there be? Your baby, too! As long as you wish to keep your life you'll not prevail over me! I won't let you do as you please! Even if your sister's life is at stake? Drive! Good morning. Brother. You came home late last night. Did you meet with someone? Why do you ask? No particular reason. Hey? Yes? What was Dr. Takazawa's research about? Why are you interested all of a sudden? Just... Tell me, brother? Yes? Do you really love your wife? The baby seems to be quite vivid. Yes! See you! Do you know the story of the rats and the rat poison? The rats from today don't die from the poison that was used to kill them 10 years ago. On the contrary, they thrive and spawn. A scientist thought this would also apply to humans. Do you know the scientist Keiichi Takazawa? Takamori ... ... is not your brother! Wait! Listen! Do you understand what I'm saying? I don't wanna hear it. Let me go! Just listen to me! Just listen! Takamori and I are alike. I don't care whether he's my real brother or not. His body is something special. He was one of the Siamese Twins. If his body is conjoined, he'll become... Doesn't matter! Stop it! I don't care! I love my brother! Stay away from him! Let me go! He wants ... ... his baby! I don't wanna hear it! Let me go! But why won't you listen! Calm down! Something terrible is going to happen when the baby is born. Let me go! Just remember! Oh, Toru ... What's the matter? I'm out of medicines. OK. You don't have to take them anymore. I got used to them to the point that I'm anxious if I don't take them. No worries! Hey! get in quick! Take her baby away right after she gave birth, got it? Fujita. What is it? The baby will be born in a couple of hours. Tonight? Any signs for that? This birth will most likely be rather unusual. She'll go into labor very soon. Really? I want you to undertake the delivery. But why don't you do it yourself? I fully trust you! Okay... Agreed! Miyuki! You can stop here. Why don't you stop! What are you doing, idiot! I'll kill Takamori's baby! This research is useless! Die! Nomura. The baby ... The baby is coming! You and your baby ... I will kill! Brother! Where are you? I kill you as you really are! You only think of yourself! You just wanna live as a human! Brother! Brother! I won't let you kill the baby! No No! Help! Brother! Miyuki! Calm down. Miyuki! Miyuki! Miyuki! Miyuki! Baby! We have to think of a name for you, right?
