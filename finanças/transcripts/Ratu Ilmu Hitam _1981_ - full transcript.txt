Murni. Murni! -Bring the flowers here. -Yes. What is it? Were you daydreaming? I'm not feeling well. May I be excused? Yes, of course. Where do I put the noodles? On the table over there. -What is it? -What's wrong? -They're rotten. -What? The noodles were only just done, but there are maggots all over them. Ma'am? -Is the rain shaman here? -Yes. I saw him with Darmo. Kohar is lucky, getting to marry the headman's daughter. At least he won't have to worry about getting a job. Yes, but poor Murni. She must be heartbroken. Nah, she was just confused. She shouldn't have fallen in love with a playboy like him. But he's handsome and good with words. Excuse me, sir. Is someone sabotaging us? I've fasted for five days. Why is it about to rain? What is happening? What is this? -What's going on? -I don't know. -Why am I levitating? Help me. -What is this? Baidah. Baidah? Don't kill me! Don't! It's not my fault! -It was all Father's doing! -Baidah, calm down! Calm down, this is your father. Baidah, this is Kohar. Don't be scared. -Baidah. -I'm scared! Mother! Calm down, it's nothing. There are no snakes! I'm scared! Mother. -Get the shaman. -Yes, sir. Snakes! -Help! -Get inside the house! Help! Help! To the west-- West? Right. She lives in the west. It must be her. Who? It's her. Gentlemen, my wife was driven mad, and the shaman who was treating my wife was killed. As civilized people, we cannot let this go. Today, misfortune befell me. The same might happen to you tomorrow. I can't believe disaster could enter this house just like that. Are you going to let this evil run amok? -No! -I didn't think so. Let's go to Murni's house now. -Agreed! -And we will bring her here. Kohar, don't act rashly. You need to find out the truth. Once I drag Murni here, we will. You will thank me later. -Let's go! -Hurry! Mother. Please don't be mad at me. I'm not a virgin anymore. He took that away from me. Murni… The thing that you should have valued most was your dignity. Please forgive me, Mother. Forgive me. He seduced me. Kohar promised that he'd marry me. If your father were still alive, and if your brother were here, this would not have happened. Mother, it was my fault. I didn't refuse. Please forgive your daughter. You're the only one I have. You are the only one who loves me. My dear daughter. Let's just leave it to God. Let's pray now. What is going on, Kohar? You have practiced black magic. Get her. Are you crazy? Black magic? I did not do that! You're an asshole, Kohar. You're a liar! Let me go! What did she do wrong? She's already miserable enough. Let go! Let her go! Get out of the way! No, Kohar! -Drag her out. -Let's go! -Mother! -Murni! Mother! Mother! Kohar, what did Murni do? Why are they hitting her? Please, Kohar. Make it stop. Don't hurt her. I beg you. In God's name, I beg you. Please don't hurt her. Set it on fire! Let's go! Come on, let's go. Let's go! Mother! -Mother! -Hey! Move. Murni! Let's go. Stop fighting! Mother! Stop. Throw her down. I thought we were taking her to the office? We have to make sure we get rid of the black magic! -Throw her off the cliff! -Yes, sir. Kohar! Don't! Kohar, you're so evil! It's all right. You're in a house that belongs to someone who doesn't hate you. You're free from the torture of those evil people. You shouldn't move too much. Just stay in bed. Last night, you were talking in your sleep. You mentioned Kohar. Who is he? He incited the villagers to harm me. What's his problem? I don't know. I just heard that he thinks I performed black magic on his wife, and on the shaman who was supposed to treat her. But honestly, it wasn't me. He was lying. I'm disappointed by his actions, but I've never wanted to do such a thing. I'd never use black magic. Why are you disappointed? He betrayed me. Oh, Murni. You believe your neighbors, but you don't believe your own lover? It's not true. How could I fall for Baidah? Everyone knows what type of woman Baidah is. She got pregnant without a husband. She's a flirt. Who knows? Men tend to like flirtatious women. Kohar… That tickles. You said it won't be long? Murni, I love you. Kohar… We shouldn't have done this now. I wasn't planning on losing my virginity here. Murni, it makes no difference. Be it here or in our bed, it's the same thing. And you will end up being mine anyway. Don't worry. And I have proven that you are still a virgin. I have nothing to look forward to on my first night. Please don't think of me as someone easy because of this. Trust me, Murni. We'll get married soon. He didn't keep his promise. He ended up marrying the headman's daughter. And not only that… I was still heartbroken over it, yet he came to my house and accused me of something horrible. He accused me of using black magic. And the rest you already know. I swear to God, I didn't do it. I'm not that evil. Do not mention that name here. It is bad luck. You've been tortured. You have to get revenge. Who else has hurt you? Who else has made you suffer? Pay them back. They accused you of using black magic? Then just practice it. Curse all those people in that village. Sir… I don't want to do that. I'll let God judge them in the afterlife. God is just. Do not mention that name here. You have to do it. You're not a goddess who is not allowed to get revenge. You have suffered. If it hadn't been for me, you would already be dead. Will you let those people who intended to kill you live happily? And will you let the headman who let his people torture you run the village? I don't understand black magic. Or voodoo. I will teach you black magic. I will make you the queen of black magic. To get revenge. What's wrong? I don't know. Isn't that Murni? -The one who is supposed to be dead. -Right. I was one of the people who threw her off the cliff. Maybe that's her ghost. Cold drinks! -Her feet are on the ground. -Yeah. That means she's not a ghost. Besides, ghosts don't go out in the afternoon. You're right. I have to go. My boss might be looking for me. You shouldn't be such a pushover. Now you're running for your life. Here you go. Wait for me! Move aside! Hurry! Help! Murni! Help! Kohar! Murni came back to life. She's furious. Pungut was cursed and his face was wrecked! Thankfully, I know some spells, so I was safe. Stop saying nonsense, Darmo. It's true, Kohar. Who could survive being thrown off the cliff? She must be dead. Then she's come back to life! I swear. Or maybe that was her spirit? I don't know. I'm sure she's going to look for you, Kohar. I didn't hurt her. The villagers did. But they did it because you made them. And you're the only one who had a relationship with Murni. I'm not afraid. Any ghost can come for me if they dare. You'll see. I went to his house. His body was covered in scabies. It was rotten and it smelled bad. Darmo thinks that everyone who joined in on hitting Murni will get what they deserve. -Really? -Yes. I have to go now. -How much is it? -What did you order? -Just coffee. -That will be 200. See you. It's Murni! Ghosts are difficult to conquer, but we cannot give up. We have to get rid of all evil! -Agree! -No! No! You're the evil one! You betrayed Murni. You took her virginity. And then you lied and accused her of something horrible! If there is evil in this world, then it is you, Kohar! You're the devil! You're a liar! You betrayed her! You're just like your daughter, old lady! Take that! Stay out of this! Shut your mouth! Keep going. Keep going! I was expecting this. You have destroyed my family. You burned down my house. You killed my daughter. And now, you're going to kill me. Kill me! What a fuss. Kohar! Are you out of your mind? Why would you hit an old lady? You need to go to the police. Her daughter practices black magic. That means she does it, too. Get up. -Enough, Kohar! -What now? You've crossed the line! Asshole. Now, everyone who refuses to become victims of black magic like the other two villagers, come with me. No! I'm the headman of this village. This is not how you all should act. I don't want history to repeat itself. This is a state of law. Every matter should be resolved legally. The law requires proof, sir. But practices like black magic cannot be easily proven. And the consequences of those acts are worse for us. I'm sorry. I have to disagree with you. Let's go. Let's go, move. Murni does not practice black magic. What is going on? -Excuse me. -Yes? -Where did the ghost go? -I'm not sure. I was so terrified. We have to find her lair. Maybe it's in the cliff. -Now? But it's late. -Yes. What are we waiting for? You should eat. I have bad news. I just attended the funeral of the person you love the most. Your mother. I never told you to become a murderer. But what they did forced you to become one. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Everything has consequences. Everyone gets what they deserve. Wait, what? What's happening? Jo! Help me, Jo! -Oh no! -This must be Murni's doing! Forgive me, Murni. Dear. There, there. Now, go to bed. Mother! Who is this cutie pie? It's okay, dear. Little one, please don't cry Little one, don't you cry Little one, you're very beautiful I want to hug-- Oh, okay. Go on, drink. That's enough. Kohar? What? Give the baby back. PRAYER ROOM Are you here to pray? Is this prayer room abandoned? Well, it is used sometimes. But the villagers here aren't consistent. They only pray when they are miserable. Once the harvest season comes, they forget. Oh, right, where are you from? The city. It seems like something wrong is happening in this village. -Meaning? -Well, they seem frightened. They get suspicious of foreigners like me. I was actually born here. You aren't wrong. This village is-- Listen. Let me tell you. You'd better leave this place. Holy verses don't work on black magic. I'm telling the truth. That's weird. You should know that black magic won't work on holy verses. Why don't you pray? Ouch! Ugh. I've asked around, but people refuse to help. It's okay. It will be okay. Siti! You're back! Thank God. Oh, dear. My baby. There, there. Don't cry. Don't go out at night. -It's just a friend's house. -Go inside. Don't make me walk too fast. -They saw Murni. -Really? Where? Where is the place, exactly? -This business with-- -What business? Hurry up, Din. I think it's over there. -This is our village's problem. -That's right. Hurry up, Din. Can I get some coffee, please? We're closing. I've been traveling, and I don't have family here. Can I just have something to drink? Please? Give him a drink, Nem. He's a traveler. Why is it so quiet? It's not even that late. Who would want to go out just to be cursed with misfortune? This village is in danger. A couple of villagers became victims of black magic. And it seems like all of the people are going to be killed off one by one. Who did this? What happened? -Two fried bananas and a cup of coffee. -Five hundred. What's wrong? Don't be afraid. By God's will, we will be safe as long as you tell me who did this. You will find out eventually if you plan on staying here. Honestly, I'm too afraid to tell you. I'm scared I might get cursed if I say something wrong. I advise you to leave this village. Don't involve yourself in the madness that is happening here. I was born here. I'd like to know what happened to the villagers. Believe me, son, that will not benefit you at all. If you take one wrong step, it might cost you your life. -What is this place? -This is a haunted area. Yes, I heard about that. I heard that, too. -Are you ready? -It's already late. -What-- -What is that? Move! -Hey! -Forward! Let's go forward! Don't run, stay and witness this! I will put an end to that black magic lady! Stop it, Murni. Please. Please… Forgive me. Stop! Murni! This is dangerous. Murni really has become a queen of black magic. I'm worried. -Kohar might die, sir. -That's true. You need to quickly report this. If not, Kohar will become another victim. We were all attacked by a strong wind, and we were helpless. That's true, sir. This is hard. I told you not to act rashly. That's because I was finding someone who can fight against black magic. That's Kohar! -Kohar? -It's Kohar! Help him! Quickly! Come on. Kohar! What happened to you? Help him, please! -Quick, get a shaman or a cleric! -Okay. This must be black magic. I don't know what to do. Do we even have a cleric? Our shaman is dead. Help! Quick! Get her inside. Kill that damn headman. Sir! What's wrong? What happened? What's happening? What is it? What is going on? Black magic! The headman is in danger! Can I borrow your sarong? Thank you, son. If it weren't for you, I don't know what would have happened. You should thank God. Thank God you were here. When I met you this afternoon, I knew that you were a powerful person. I can tell. You look calm and wise. I don't have any powers. But I am sure that every evil can be defeated by God's knowledge. Anyone can defeat black magic if they believe in Him. The headman said that the man is young, but he's more powerful than our previous shaman. Yeah, Darmo said the same thing. He's Santri. He practices Islam. People have started praying again. Darmo. This is what a village should look like. A prayer room, and people who use it to pray. If there are still people who recite the Koran every day, then there is hope that this village will be free from misfortune. That's right. I've killed Kohar. I feel satisfied now. The wrath that I have kept in my chest is now gone. Not yet. You haven't punished the other people who hurt you. Every single one of them. Including the people who indirectly killed your mother. My only enemy is Kohar. The others don't matter to me. I want to leave this village. Maybe go to the city, or another village where the people don't know who Murni is. You will be more miserable. People in this village can be vicious. They have all been calling you the queen of black magic. You won't be accepted by society anywhere. Anywhere. You must continue to curse this village and kill every person in this village until Headman Sabri kneels down in front of you and me. Then you and I will run this village. I don't think I can do that. They're just followers. They didn't do anything wrong. Kohar was the one who persuaded them with his rotten mouth. You need to remember one thing. The magic that I taught you will eat you up if you don't use it on someone else. Hey, who does this belong to? Hello! Who's taking a bath there? Hello? Hello, is this yours? That's mine! Should I bring it to you? No, don't! I'm not wearing anything. I'll throw it to you. Excuse me? Can you wait a bit? Thank you. If not for your help, I'd have been very embarrassed. I was just passing by. -You went fishing? -Yes. Would you like these? -For me? -Yes. There is no one to cook for me anyway. I'm not from here. Where are you from? The city. My name is Permana. Permana Sidik. My name is Seruni. Do you have family here? I did. But not anymore. Is your house far from here? Yes. I come here every morning and afternoon. -Are you going back to the village? -Yes. Can I walk you home? It's all right, thank you. I have to go. Thank you for the fish. Son of a bitch! They've started praying again. Murni! That stupid headman has repented. I need your help, Murni. Destroy Sabri's family. I want to stop doing this. This is how you repay me? What is happening? Honey? -What is going on? -This is black magic, dear. Go get Permana! Oh God. Son. Permana. Ma'am? What's wrong? It's the headman. Stay calm, dear. Sir. Will you recite the sura Al-Falaq with me? Don't just hold in your pain. Son of a bitch! That Santri must die! Did you get a lot of fish? Hi, Seruni. Were you washing your clothes? -Yes. -Want to join me? -Sure. -You can use this. Look! -Isn't it big! -Yes! Careful, pull! Be careful! Seruni! Come here. Hold on! Are you okay? -Seruni? Hey! Seruni, don't! -Permana… Are you all right? Let's go. Oh dear God. What if-- You should go home. No one is waiting for me. Really? And no one ever will. I saw it myself! Maybe you were wrong, Darmo. How could I be wrong? Even in the dark at night, I can still tell a 100-rupiah note from a 1,000-rupiah note. This was in broad daylight! To be honest, I'm worried. What if Permana is working with that queen of black magic? Or maybe he and Murni are working together to curse this village? That's possible. Because our powerful shaman, Kamdi, was defeated by Murni. What could he do, if he were not the one who cursed us? Let's be real. Our situation right now is messed up. Listen. Don't act rashly. We don't have any proof. We shouldn't just ambush them. I saw it myself. Isn't that proof? No. That's an allegation. If we all see it ourselves, then that would be proof. -Do you agree? -Yes. Good afternoon. Afternoon. What's going on here? We're planning a gathering. Oh, okay then. I'm going to the headman's house. -See you around. -See you. A Santri like him cannot possibly be doing black magic. Really? Do you know the saying, "A wolf in sheep's clothing"? That's dangerous. Are you going to marry him? Not in this village. I'm going with him to the city. He has a house there. That's your right. But be careful. Men are very clever with their words. Remember Kohar? He was nice, too. But it turned out that he was a playboy. I'm just saying, you need to make sure. Baidah, please keep Permana company. -All right. -I have some work to do. -Someone asked me to write a letter. -All right, sir. I'll be right back. Just hang out. It's still working hours for me. All right, sir. Your heart is aching with lust. Your body misses the warmth of a man's touch. Hey. I heard you're going back to the city? Yes, if all goes well. This Sunday. This Sunday? So soon? Why? Do you not like it here? Are you lonely? You can call me. You will find someone. To tell you the truth, I have a girlfriend. We're getting married in the city. Men are all liars! Men are animals! All the people here deserve to die! Especially Permana and Baidah. What's wrong now? She took the love of my life two times. She destroyed my hope two times. I swear… on the devils in hell that tonight, I will kill everyone in this village! Oh God! Oh no! Get water! Help him! -Stand still! -Please lie down. Put out the fire! It's okay, calm down! Calm down. Please, recite the prayers I taught you. I will face them outside. All right. Seruni? I'm not Seruni. I'm Murni. The queen of black magic. I'm here to kill you. Murni? You're Saijah's daughter? How do you know my mother's name? You're just a snobbish city dweller. You use your innocence to charm the ladies. But I will not be fooled. Wait. That's not important. I just want-- Murni! Murni, wait! I'm your brother! I'm Kliwon, your big brother! You were so small when Mr. Maulana took me to Banten. He made me one of his students. I traveled so far away. After that, we lost contact. For years. Don't listen to him, Murni. This is about winning or losing. He's just bluffing. Believe me, I'm your brother. Murni, don't do this! What happened? We're all just actors on this stage of life. I don't mind dying by your hand, my Permana. My Kliwon. Murni. You're my brother. And my lover. Watch out! Fight him. He's the one who used me. Help me. Evil! -Look out! -No! So, you're the one behind all of this, Gendon. Don't be surprised, Sabri. I'm here because I lost. I've spent years training myself to destroy you. Dozens of black magic teachers have taught me. And now it is time for you to give the title of headman to me. Otherwise, I will destroy this village. Son of a bitch. You plan to kill the people for not voting for you! And you cursed my family just so you could become headman! Sabri, let's finish this, just the two of us. Who deserves the title? You or me? That has long been decided. The people would never vote a son of a bitch like you in as headman. Now, it's between the authorities and a troublemaker who must be destroyed. Son of a bitch. You shall be destroyed, Sabri. My sister. Brother.
