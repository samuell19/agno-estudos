- It looks like while it was painted, it was, like, painted off of instinct, you know? - Mm-hm. -I think that's kinda what the artist is trying to say here -- like... this struggle is very instinctual and, like... just, like, her brushstrokes, you know? I just know it's aesthetically pleasing. Like, I like looking at this... at this thing, you know? - It looks like while it was painted, it was, like, painted off of instinct, you know? - Mm-hm. - I think that's kinda what the artist is trying to say here -- like... this struggle is very instinctual and, like-- - Recording a podcast is easy if you have the right equipment. You're going to need a microphone, a recording device, and a place to upload your file so it's easy to share. Let's record something! - The scene has a tendency of shifting from day to day. And I suppose that's the purpose of my podcast. I've always had an interest in collecting sound -- conversations... ambience... I have thousands of recordings. I usually will record digital, then I re-record analog because analog just sounds better. My process may seem weird, but I embrace the unconventional. For my podcast, I'll be following underground musicians -- bands that you've probably never heard of. I find the best way to discover new music is at a record store, tucked away, hidden from shallow people who don't appreciate good music. These groups can be a bit elusive at times, nonconformists, playing unmarketed shows in spotty basements and seedy venues. When I'm at these shows, I see how music connects people. I see these artists onstage, and they have something that I don't: a certain kind of tenacity that almost feels superhuman. For this podcast, I hope to investigate these artists, research them. Tune in each week for exclusive interviews and performances... with some of the best undergrou-- With some of the best underground musicians in the city. My name is Lennon Gates. Do you mind if I interview you for my podcast? -No, I'm good. - Make yourself at home. Want any tea? - No, thank you. So, um... I'm Lennon. My podcast is basically just, like... about the local music scene, and I, like, interview underground musicians, um... so I guess, basically, I'm just gonna ask you some questions about music and art and yourselves. -I think that comes across a lot more in some of the current material that we're working on right now. Um, we're in the process of completing a full-length album. -Mm, 'Oscillations.' -'Oscillations.' It was this past summer, it was record heat, and I made my way over to the creek in our backyard, and... I just spent hours watching the water flow through the rocks... and I remember having this... profound realization that... us -- and everything around us-- -Mm. -Are composed of atoms oscillating in and around us. - Mm-hm, yes. - Yeah. Mm-hm. So that's slated for fall of 2026 release, so we're excited about that. -Have you guys been on a podcast before? -Can you describe your genre? -Queer death pop. - Experimental indie? - Experimental pop? -I think we call ourselves "indie folk." -I guess I'd just be "Alternative." - Uh, I'm in a-- I'm in a duo; we don't really identify as "a band." That would seem like kind of a weird thing to call ourselves. -Our genre is "junkyard bop" or "family band"... um, like if your really strange relative, uh, was a band. -My art is super... super colorful and super fun. - Mm-hm. - Been the proverbial door to my... self-indignation. Instead of you... I...belong here. All right, here's another new one. This one's unreleased. -I've been trying to push myself outside of my comfort zone more. -Is, uh, that why we came here? -I saw Jen Tsang post about it. -Who's Jen Tsang? -I've been wanting to tell you. I've been booking more interviews lately, so I probably won't be able to see you as much in the next few months. -I mean, we don't really see much of each other anyway. -How's Mom? -I don't know, why don't you call her? -Why doesn't she call me? -Who's Jen Tsang? -She's a politically-driven musician. -Isn't that like a tea or something? -No, she's a politically-driven musician. -Are you still working at Philip Arthur's? -Yeah. But I haven't been taking as many hours. -Does Mike still work at Philip Arthur's? -I've been looking for a new apartment. -Where? -I don't know. I want more space to be creative. And, like, where the bedroom is the same room as the kitchen. -So like a studio apartment? -Yeah, like a studio apartment. - Can I get you guys another drink? -Um, no, thanks, we'll take the check, and you can put both of them on mine. - Got it. - Thanks. -Can I try yours? -Sure, whatever. You know, when I used to work at Philip Arthur's, we literally only had eight people on the whole staff, and we did one event every weekend. Now, he's, like, running every event for the whole frickin' town. Stretch his sleeves... that were never meant to be long... asking myself, "Do good people do this? And am I one?" So we try again, and again fade to black... with lust... maybe lost... maybe needing more time... remembering the sticky things... mostly... how sweet our tongues used to be. -Thanks for letting me record that. - I've never been on a podcast before. -As a producer, I go for a real lo-fi sound. I strive to capture honesty in the musicians I record. I'm a songwriter, too. -Dope. -I've been looking for ways to break into the music scene. I don't really perform, though. I just have, like, notebooks filled with lyrics. -You have anything I can read? -Yeah, I have a few songs written. This is my journal. - "You'll be the one I lament when I've grown... and I long to forget everything that I've known. But I've still got miles and miles to go." This stuff is good. -I have a lot of other songs, too. Um, I gotta go. Thanks. So we try again... and again fade to black... with lust... "With lust..." - Maybe lost... maybe needing more time. - "Time..." Remembering the sticky things... mostly... how sweet our tongues used to be. - "How sweet our tongues used to be." Four years ago, the Tack Gallery was shut down. The space was originally used as a meat factory, but after the building closed, bands began using the empty rooms to play shows. In the spring of 2016, an underaged kid named Danny Brooks got drunk at a show. He stumbled outside and fell asleep on the railroad tracks, which ran behind the building. The owner and older man named Ed Flock was forced to close the space after Danny Brooks' body was fatally run over by a train. Shortly after, Ed was arrested for tax evasion. The city took control of the space, and the factory remained empty and unused for three years, until Ed's nephew, Randy Flock, gained ownership. Next Friday, the Tack Gallery will open its doors once again for a secret show at 9PM. I'll see you all there. - Damn the Witch Siren is a witch-rock music group founded by Bobbi Kitten and Z-Wolf. Bobbi Kitten's sultry prowess as a frontwoman puts Damn the Witch Siren as one of the most popular music groups in the scene. Accompanying Bobbi is her partner Z-Wolf, a mysterious musician who's only ever seen wearing his wolf mask. In February, they released their full-length album, 'Red Magic.' It's a concept album about Feminism, sex, lust, love, setting fire to the Patriarchy, and Bobbi's journey of self-discovery and owning her sexuality. -Wait. -I think it's... I think we should start from the beginning. -Do you like music? -Yeah, I like music. -Me too. You want a chip? -Sure. -So last week... I realized my favorite chip... is the folded-over chip. It's just two chips stacked on top of each other. I could have my favorite chip in every bite... if I just put two chips on top of each other... and ate 'em at once. But here's the thing: two chips on top of each other doesn't taste like a folded-over chip. - It's nowhere near as good. Maybe the flavor gets stuck between 'em. - The Old North District is where most artists and musicians in the city live. Rent is cheap. It's north of campus, away from the bros. You'll find the true artist inconspicuously planted along Hudson Avenue. In the 14th century, the great minds of the time gathered in Florence, sharing music, poetry, fashion. -Hell yeah. - Old North is like modern Florence; the scene here is small and concentrated, circles constantly intersecting, musicians and artists mingling and collaborating. It isn't difficult at all for one artist to cross paths with another. -Excuse me. Hi, I'm Lennon. -I'm Bobbi. -We're heading upstairs. Wanna come? -Yeah, I do. Yo, this is, um... Lennon? -Oh, yo! Yeah, we did that podcast. -Yeah, hey. -We're heading upstairs to go smoke and read some poems. You wanna come? -Sure. -That's good shit, Micah. -Thanks. Yo. I never got a chance to hear that recording you did. Can you send it to me? -Oh, for sure. -You guys have to listen to some of Lennon's lyrics. They're incredible. -You write? -Um... a bit, but I don't really perform. -Come on. -I mean... Yeah, I-- I can play something. Can you hand me that guitar? I haven't really played this one out loud much, though. -You wrote that? -Yeah, uh, I'm still kinda working on that one. -It's good. -It's damn good. - Thanks. -Yo, you should come to Kate's place later tonight. Bobbi and Z are doing a house show. -Yeah, I can come. Actually, um, I host a podcast. Would you possibly... be willing to let me interview you after the show? -Sure. -I record everything on my phone, so if you could just direct your answers here, that'd be great. The song you played tonight, it seems like it could be autobiographical. -Mm, yeah, it's kinda of about reveling in your darkness, too. -Could you talk a little bit about your process? Like how you write? -I feel like you're so far away. Why don't you join us? That's better. ...to get a lot of opportunities, but we're too big to be doing, like, the same local scene all the time. I wanna break rules; I wanna do shit that hasn't been done. I think that really inspires people. -What other things are you into? Like besides music. - Well, I really like, uh, experimental art and performance art. And Z's really into animal rights. I mean, we both are; we both really love animals. Except fish. Ugh. You know, you should party with us tonight. -You're going somewhere else? -I mean, I don't wanna derail this interview right now. -Y-- yeah, I mean... we can finish it...later or... -I mean, whenever you want. Yeah, let's get outta here. -Okay. Do you want one? -Sure. - Stick out your tongue. Can I draw a star on your face? -A star? -Yeah, like right here. -Okay, sure. -Okay, close your eyes. Looks fuckin' awesome. -Good morning, Birdy. - Ahh! Ahh! - One. One. One. Is this consensual sex? Yes. Yes, it is. Two. Two. A dialogue between two lovers. Two. Two. A dialogue between my id and my super-ego. Two. - It looks like it was painted off of instinct. You can see it in her brushstrokes. I've been booking a lot more interviews for my podcast lately. -That's awesome! -Well, I'm trying to push myself outside of my comfort zone more. -Are you uncomfortable? -Sometimes. I've been...going to more shows... finding new sounds. That was the first performance art piece I've ever seen. -So what'd you think? -It was captivating. -I think the appeal for me is honestly just... witnessing something I haven't seen before. You know, like creating a space or environment for something completely new. I mean, you're an artist, right? You get it. -Yeah. -Hey, I have an idea. Here, turn towards me. Okay, lemme take this, though. Oh, wait, actually, you should finish it. Bottoms up. Okay. Now... in order for this to work, no laughter, no smiles; we have to be completely serious, okay? So the idea is you're gonna mimic everything that I do, like facial expressions, motions, okay? -Okay. -And if we do it right, eventually, I'll start mimicking you back, so that you won't be able to tell who's starting and who's following. And then we'll just be creating art simultaneously. Get it? -Okay. - No smiling. Okay. No laughing! You're gonna make me laugh. I saw that podcast girl again. Lennon? She's weird. There's something I kinda like about her, though. - Hello? - Hey. Um, this is Lennon. - Oh, hey! What's up? -Um... I was wondering if you would maybe wanna finish the interview for my podcast. Oh, yeah, totally! Well, I'll be home in, like, 30 minutes. Do you wanna meet at my place? -That would be awesome. - If you see the cats around, watch out; Lyla's kind of an asshole. But yeah, I actually have to go grab a few things from Z real fast, but you can make yourself at home. I'll be like five minutes or so. We can start the interview as soon as I get back. -Sure. - I'll see you in a bit. All right. I'm ready! Um, do you wanna do this outside so we can smoke? - Sure. - Okay, let's go. -Okay. Take two. -Take two. -I'm here with Bobbi Kitten, the lead singer for the band Damn the Witch Siren. -Yo, yo, yo, what's up, Lennon listeners?! -She's wearing a large fur coat, looks like it could be... bear fur? -Is that bear fur? -God, no! Lennon, have you been paying attention at all? This is a fake fur coat; I repeat, fake fur coat. I do not condone the slaughter of poor, innocent creatures. - Okay, okay. -Except if it's a fish. Stop. - Okay. So... when you're writing, do you feel like your fanbase influences your writing? -Well, I mean, I think it used to a lot more, when I first started out. I started this band wanting to write dance music because nobody in this town is, like, writing dance music. I just wanted people to have fun, you know? Feel like they could enjoy themselves. But lately, I just feel... I don't know, like I'm writing more...emotional stuff -- stuff that gets me really excited. I'm writing stuff for myself... and my cat. -So what are you working on now? -Um, yeah, so I've been... writing stuff on the piano, and I'm really proud of, like... all these words that are coming out of me, you know? And I'm hoping to collaborate with my girl Lennon, who is an incredible writer. Okay, I'm gonna edit that out. -Don't! Why would you do that? Seriously, you should be proud of that shit. It's one of the best things about you. -What? -Your art, your ideas. I lot of people don't have shit to say. And you do. And it's important. -So... what's the best thing about Bobbi Kitten? - I don't wanna do that. -No, seriously. What's your favorite thing about yourself? I wanna know. Um... - The scene has a tendency of shifting from day to day. A perpetual pursuit for something new. A true musician pushes boundaries in every way possible... using their art as a platform for something completely original. Those in the scene know this. - I love it. It's amazing. You should totally record this. -I mean, you really got something, Lennon. Like... -I just worry about... what people will think and, like, sharing that kind of stuff feels so intimate. - Well, it is. I mean, that's why it inspires people -- being real. You should totally record this. Well, it is. I mean, that's why it inspires people -- being real. - I love the sound of your voice. -Uh... I hate the sound of my voice. Holy shit, you have, like, so many recordings on here. It's wild. -Yeah. -Here, let me try one. - After some persuasion, I've decided I'll be releasing my first EP next week. As a writer, I've mostly kept my work to myself. As a writer, I've mostly kept my work to myself. After some persuasion, I've decided I'm going to be releasing my first EP next week. As a writer, I've mostly kept my work to myself. But in an effort to push myself outside of my comfort zone, I'm going to be releasing some of my songs. I'll be releasing them on all social media platforms, so stay tuned for that. You know, I've been working on some new music recently. -For your podcast? -Well... I might release it on there. -Uh, before I forget... some cash from Mom. -Do you wanna listen to it? -To what? -To my new music. -In here? Okay, whatever. Stupid. You wrote this? This is good. It's really good, Lennon. -Thanks. -How come Z wears that mask all the time? -People wear masks every day; maybe he's just a little bit more straightforward about it. I honestly think it's 'cause he doesn't really like people very much. I think he likes putting fear in people. I think it's a way for him to, like... not have to deal with people's bullshit. Later, bitch! Have fun at work! -This Wednesday night, your boy will be playing at The Livestock. Come watch me; I've got some new music to share, and-- it's a blessing. I'm excited. Let's go. Woo! - What'd you get on it? Oh! - So we're going in a new direction. - You know, we just got a noise complaint; they're trying to kick us out. - What great things are marred with words only intended to fill the void. -Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I am that second mouse. - Butter mouse! - Say hi. - Hi. - Hi! I don't know. - Thank you so much, we're WYD. This is your new song. - Hey. It's a pinot noir. - Thanks. - Like right now is my pinot phase, but... I kinda dabble in some merlots, you know? Uh, listen, I'm not gonna call anyone out by name or anything like that... but there are some fake-ass musicians out there, and I gotta get this off my chest; trust me, I really do. And the thing is, I guess, that I'm most pissed off about is because I thought I was a good judge of character. I really did. -Hey, Bobbi. It's Lennon. You haven't been responding. Um... I just wanna make sure... Are we okay? Hello? Bobbi? So what's the best thing about Bobbi Kitten? - I don't wanna do that. - No, seriously. What's your favorite thing about yourself? I wanna know. Um... I feel confident. I have stuff to say. And... I don't know, I guess I feel really sure of myself. And I like that I don't ever have to second-guess myself, you know? Here, lemme hold this. You bitch, come on! All right, just, like, you know what I mean? - I don't... - Come on, and then we can build up after that. You're too shy! You're too shy. Free yourself. I don't give a fuck what they think. I don't give a fuck! Woo! Woo, woo, woo! -Wait. Hold on. You should wear this. It is my intention for my podcast... My intention for my podcast is to explore this city's... underground music scene. It is my intention for my podcast to explore this... this city's underground m--... Following cutting-edge artists... Following cutting-edge... musicians-- I intend to capture a true-- a true depiction... of-- I... I-- I belong here. You aren't gonna pull a Danny Brooks on me, are you? -Are you, like, a stalker? -I'm not a stalker, I host a podcast. I...research. -You researched me? -Yes, because you were on my podcast. -I never even listened to one of your podcasts. -Why have you been ignoring me? -You bring your journal with you, Lennon? -Yes. -And all those words in there... you wrote those? -Yes. -You know I know you stole that song. -I don't know what you're talking about. -What, you think you're just gonna keep lying about it? Like, you're just gonna play it off like you wrote all those songs? Like no one's gonna find out? What are you gonna do? You know I'm gonna tell everyone. You know that, right? Do you steal my songs, too? -No. - Lemme see your journal, then. -Why? -'Cause I wanna see it. - Stop! The scene has a tendency of shifting from day to day. I suppose that's why I began this podcast: to collect inspiration, to observe artists and their creativity... their originality... and to push myself outside of my comfort zone. Now... I finally feel confident. I have stuff to say, and... I guess I feel really sure of myself. And I like that I never have to second-guess myself. I know I don't have that many listeners, but do those of you who do listen, thank you. Fuck.
