The fifth year of the deadliest war in history. Though weakened, Nazi Germany still feels invincible. Great powers map out the borders of the new world. Poland can either be free or be enslaved by the Soviets. Poles are ready to fight. The Home Army awaits news from London to start the uprising. The race against time begins. Out! Officer. My daughter is only six. I'm teaching her German. She can sing for you. Jadzia. Sing. O Christmas Tree O Christmas Tree How lovely are thy branches Are you Volksdeutsche? No. I've studied painting in Vienna for four years. Only one side is right. You can choose. I don't understand. - Should we move? - Tell us. This one, or that one Why? This one, or that one? I can't. Choose! What does it matter? Half of us has to go! No. Half has to go. Heads - you. Tails - them. It'll be all right. Tails. They stay. Troops, on my command! Left face! About-face! Load! Aim! Fire! Prime minister? I was not expecting you. You're leaving? Yes, to Scotland. For a parachute training. - Then I'll jump back to the country. - We have to go. - Follow me. - But I... And I'm urging you. Do not speak of it. Not to anyone! Even if they chopped you to pieces. It's a government secret. Not a word to anyone! The English are not happy. - You're pushing it too hard. - Not hard enough. For six months I've tried to get to Churchill. But you know that, as a Pole, I have no chance for a meeting. A Soviet would stand a better chance. That's how it is. Only the Germans give him more trouble than we do. How did you pull that off? I am the Polish Prime Minister. Theoretically, it makes me someone of an equal standing. Still, he's meeting us in a stranger's house. We'll spend a decade under Soviet occupation. Not necessarily. I have a proposition for Stalin. Only Bór, back in Poland, can help me. Here, in London, we're powerless. Bór has to understand that. And get me the leverage - over Stalin. - The leverage? A fight. An open battle with the Germans. For Warsaw. This is suicide. Didn't you understand - what Churchill said? - It's not your decision. Your task is to convince Bór to start an uprising on his own. Without the Commander in Chief. And regardless of Mr Churchill's views. Is that clear? Yes, Prime Minister. Now fly off to that training. Return to Warsaw as soon as you can. Obersturmbannführer! You're back? You could say so. Himmler sent me. I'll be using your office. Our London agent has sent it by diplomatic post, through Madrid. Very nice. Bold lines. But why didn't he just take a picture? A handsome young man. A fairly Aryan type. Why are we looking at this? This handsome young man is lieutenant Jan Kwiatkowski. Six months ago, he got to London through Stockholm using the organization "Załoga." - That informant of yours... - Jarach. Jarach reports they have already smuggled a few others to the UK. Why is this one special? They smuggled Kwiatkowski twice. - In the same direction. - A courier... Well, well... Who did he meet with in London? Mikołajczyk, Anthony Eden and Churchill. Yes, Sir Winston Churchill. So who is he meeting in Warsaw? - Witze? - Bór. Gentlemen. The Oberführer has sent me here to find the commander of the Home Army. Before the Russians take over Warsaw and the commanders fall right into their hands. They are taking over Warsaw? Sturmbannführer. You are an SD officer. Don't get your intel from the minister's radio speeches. This Kwiatkowski... If God really is on our side, we can turn this war around. Prime Minister wants to see you. What have you done? It's nothing. It'll grow together. But I can't jump. I'll have to sail back through Stockholm. And how long will that take? This morning the Allies landed in Normandy. Now it's crucial to forge a relationship with the Soviets, - and you break your hand? - What relationship? They will invade us. I don't care how you do it. Get to Bór immediately! Yes, Reichsführer. Kwiatkowski is our best chance of getting to Bór. Yes sir. Well said, sir. "A simple courier can be the messenger of Gods." What an idiot. Warsaw... Wait. - That's idiotic... - Excuse me? - Does a German spy look like that? - I've never met one. Have you? The Commander is away. General Tatar will see you. Follow me. I'm here to see the Commander. Haven't you heard, papa? The Commander is away for a few months. - What is it? - I got urgent orders to return to Warsaw. I'd love to help you out, but I've got bad news. Gestapo destroyed "Załoga." The Stockholm and Gdynia way is closed. It's a pickle. - If that's all... - General. I've heard of an airlift from Brindisi to Tarnów. There is an airlift. For high officials and crucial deliveries. For V-2 rockets falling on London, and not for you. - Papa. - May I remind you... You may not. I'm in charge here! You're not that important. I won't stop you. Sail to Brindisi whenever you want. Just like everyone else. On a boat, through the sea. Mission accomplished, general. - I'll walk my niece back. - Thank you, officer cadet. We have women in the army now? We'll get children if we have to. - How was the jump? - Uneventful, but the feeling... - It's intense. - I was just saying that the courier from London broke his arm during a training jump. What an idiot. - I'm 46 and I'm fine. - He's not a parachutist. But that won't stop him. Nothing can. He'll get to Warsaw, even if he has to swim. Not before the Soviets invade us. We have to wait. We can't start without the British support. General, lieutenant Jan Nowak, Home Army courier from Warsaw. I've heard of you. I'm surprised you're still here. Aren't they waiting for you? General Tatar refuses to fly me to Brindisi. I need to speak to you before I leave. - You're ignoring the chain of command. - I am, major. Why is Tatar refusing? I don't know, general. He just said he's in charge. Interesting. But I can't help you. I'm flying to Italy for an inspection. Good luck. Mikołajczyk ordered me to convince Bór to ignore London and fight. I'm sorry, my dear. I need to talk to the lieutenant. - I'm entrusting my wife to you, major. - Yes, sir. Let's go somewhere quiet. That's absurd! Did he say that? We cannot let that happen. In the current military situation, it'd be a political suicide, a crime! Fly to Warsaw and stop Bór from the madness of Mikołajczyk. - And of his likes. - Yes, sir. Do not engage with the Germans. Keep the nation alive! Retreat west. I'll take you to Brindisi with me. Then you'll be on your own. And tell Tatar that I am in charge here. Goodbye. Come in, major. There are microfilms in the handle of the brush. Get them to Bór. Guard them with your life. If something happens, destroy them first. - Save yourself later. - Yes, sir. Did I scare you? - Morning. - Get in, we'll talk. There are RAF parachutists appearing in the General Governorate. They even landed a British plane. Near Tarnów. Get a plane to Bremerhaven for our London agent. When the U-Boot arrives, it should bring the agent here. - To Warsaw. - To Warsaw? The agent is following Kwiatkowski. When he lands in Poland, the agent should be here too. Fuck... Now I have to go to Poland. Radio Berlin speaking. These are the latest news. Yesterday, a pack of traitors, bloodthirsty militarists, junkers and Prussian barons, made a cowardly attempt to... - Do you have a light? - There you go. Hundreds of Germans are fleeing Warsaw. Meet me at the Poniatowski bridge. Follow me, lieutenant. The attack on Hitler might be used as a pretext for the uprising. - Stop them. - Yes, sir. Stop them. Übermenschen... They herd animals like shepherds. Stolen animals! The city will explode. People won't let them steal and leave. Attack now, before they can react. We can't. The Russians are too far away. We have to fight before they come in. We can't win alone. We need English support. And we still don't know anything. So where's that bloody courier? Throw in more. I can hear it. Don't go out at night! There are partisans there. - Shut up, woman! - They've already warned you once! Shut up or I'll lose it! They killed Staszek, isn't that enough? Shut up! Go home! Can you hear that? A two-engine Dakota. I don't think they'll be bombing us. How many men have you got? They're mechanics. The landing site is guarded by a hundred partisans. I'm not sending 12 mechanics there. This is a mutiny! But it's not foolery. Call the SS from Tarnów, and we'll go. Hey! My hat! My shoe! Come on! - What's going on? - Go, go, go! - Faster! - Get the stretcher! Boss! There you go. They thought it was mine. Hurry! And the hat? It's so loud! What about the Germans? The SS barracks are in Tarnów. It's an hour before they get here. Push it out! Dig under the wheels! - There are no shovels. - Use something else! - No shovels? - No. - The other plane was just fine. - The ground is soggy. Let's go, they'll hear us! If the plane is grounded, wagons will take the cargo. You have to wait. We can use this. Tear off the boards. Dig with them, put them under the wheels. Can you translate? I need to talk to the pilot. Captain! There are no shovels to dig you out. Can you take off before dawn? Translate it. I'll tell him. He says it's impossible. Take it all out. - We'll burn the plane. - Burn the plane? We won't let that happen! - What will you do? - Claw it out of the ground. It's no good. How many men are keeping watch? - Fifteen. - Get them all here. Get the boards! The rest, keep pushing! Move it! Hurry! Push it! Jesus... They'll fly in broad daylight. The SS will be here soon. Let's go. Attention! At ease. Another plane is coming in a week. - Take them to your mother's. - Yes, sir. Sniper! Search the forest! You stay here. Kazek, get them. First the son, now the father. When will this bloody war end? What are you still here? You have a more important job to do. If they stop us, we won't talk our way out of this. - How old was he? - 19. Germans don't scare me, but Stolarska does. She wouldn't let him come to the forest with us. Locked him in the house. What a world... Grab him. Hats. Move it. I won't ask again. There's still smoke. It got stuck, they had to dig it out. I'll notify the Luftwaffe. Search all houses, stations and roads. For whom? This man. You go to the station. - I'll check the houses. - Yes, sir! The Krauts won't go out at night. That's how strong we are. Gee up! When the Russians come, they'll be done for. Right. And so will we. Who's going to Cracow? We are! Get them on the wagon and go. How's Stolarska? Her oldest died in Auschwitz, and now the youngest... Good luck. Wipe the blood off the wagon. Or you'll be done for. We'll bike to Słotwina. - Is it far? - 20 km. We have two hours, it's enough. Are you coming? Let's take a wagon. We don't have one. Let's switch with them. They left, there's no time. I have to get to Słotwina and check the station first. What's the problem? We'll take your bike on the wagon. We don't have a wagon. What is it? - Nothing. - So? - I can't do it. - Why? You won't need that hand. - I can't ride a bike. - What? Everyone can. Everyone can, but I can't. Good! Hold it. Turn! Keep going! Stop. Try again. Try again. Keep going. Keep the handle straight! Go! We're fu... A parachutist who can't ride a bike... I'm not a parachutist. - We won't get there in time. - Get my wagon, some chickens and eggs. We're going to the market. - God bless you... - Germans! They're coming! Get to the attic. Get the kid! Lift him up. Tell her to stop. Stolarska, stop swiping. Where are her husband and sons? With the bandits? The husband died back in 1939. The eldest was arrested. Only the youngest is left. In the forest. He's probably dead. Where is he? Where is your youngest son, Stolarska? Answer him. That's SS. Not some village guards. Did she see any strangers? Have you seen any strangers around the house today? Tell her to answer. What are you doing? Witze? Tell him! Even if you haven't seen them. Why did she cry? Why did you cry? Burn it down... - Don't! - You only live once. You can't help her now. Don't you have a mission to complete? Officer... All these goods... We're not thieves. To the station. Are you coming, lieutenant? Get the horses and the wagon, or they'll burn! The two of us going to the market? Is that it? We're making fools of ourselves. We need another story. Something more believable... Papers. Going to the market? Yes. I can tell by the hens. The Germans called the station. They're looking for a parachutist. Blond, medium built, about 35. Just like you. We're just traders. Traders! Then you must be going to the market. Stop fooling me. You were supposed to come with Włodek, three men on bikes, not two men on a wagon. How do I recognize you? I'm standing here, wondering if its you. Here's the third one. Here are your tickets. Better stay away from the building. A few travelers. No Germans. - They're looking for a blond man... - All right. - Put your hat on. - I've lost it. Good luck. Medical transports keep coming. We're lucky we're just 30 minutes late. The Russians are crushing them. Few come back alive. The train is 45 minutes late. Don't get so worked up. The Germans haven't been here for a week. They're late. They'll call the station in Podłęże. The gendarmes will halt us there. They're after me. There's a sharp turn in 6 or 7 km. - You can jump. - I must get to Warsaw. You won't get to Warsaw. The Gestapo will catch you first. That's up to you. Do not leave the train! Stay inside! Don't leave the train! Control! Nobody leaves the train. Come in. Follow me. Papers! Take the hat off! Papers! Take the hat off! Papers! Take the hat off! Take the hat off! Papers! Papers! Papers! Take the hat off! You can go now. Report to us if you see him. Mr Janicki! Tell everyone they can leave the train now. You can leave the train now! We're departing in a minute. A Volksdeutsch, but a good man. - Will we get to Warsaw before curfew? - We should. What kind of a conductor asks a passenger that? A wartime conductor, ma'am. All on board! The train is leaving! Attention! Fire! Excuse me. We can take the city garrison. Maybe. The Goering division parachutists came to Żyrardów yesterday. Without Sosabowski we don't stand a chance. What about the courier? Any news? A plane from Brindisi landed last night. But Tatar's wire only mentioned Wolski and two men from Cracow. The courier is not in the flight manifest. - It's after curfew. - We could use a quiet night. Another day... Him. And him. You! Papers. Open the suitcase. You two! Papers. Open the suitcases. - Anything else? - No. Are you sure? In here! Lord... The wounded that didn't make it. About the English lessons? Come in. Sit down. - Give me an hour. - It's urgent! I know nothing about that. They told me to go get the girl, so I'll go get her. They said you should wait. But if you wanna leave, go. I wouldn't mind it, especially with that deadly smell. No honors. They want 100,000 men for digging? They're taking our army! We must act! I've called the "W" Hour. - For tomorrow at 5 PM. - Lord, it's begun! What have you done? We can't let the Germans get us first. - Right! - It's not a good time! - It never is. - We can choose the best one! - Call it off, now! - General. We mobilized 40,000 soldiers. They're getting weapons. - It cannot be stopped! - Colonel Monter, withdraw the order. Yes, sir. He came on the night train from Cracow. Dammit! You had him, Witze! Another mistake and this operation won't end well. Yes, Obersturmbannführer. They want to kill us all. They've been preparing for that for years. They're plotting, scheming. They have the biggest underground army in Europe. Now the time has come. Soon. Maybe even today... Himmler ordered me to get to Bór and convince him that his true enemies are the Soviets. And we... We're just a lesser evil. Poles would gladly kill us and the Soviets alike. Do we anyone who has seen Kwiatkowski? Just Jarach. Others were lost in the Gestapo in Gdynia. One more thing. Our English agent arrived from London. I'll be damned! - That's them. - Good morning. I came for Mr Wolski. - That's me. - What about me? I know nothing about you. They haven't told you I was coming? - That's what I said. - General Tatar didn't... I'm lieutenant Jan Nowak. I must see the commanders immediately! - I've never heard of you. - Goddammit. These are extraordinary circumstances! Do you understand? What is this nonsense? Do you think I have access to everyone and I lead strangers to the command? Let's go, Mr Wolski! I have information of great national importance. The commanders need them. If they were so important, they would've told me. There's nothing I can do. Are you coming, Mr Wolski? What about him? He can't stay here. I just told they're here. You don't know him, so how should I? He seems too pushy. - Wants to see the commanders! - I swear I'll punch you! You come in, nobody knows you. You might be a snitch! - Or worse! - Easy! Calm down. I'll break the rules, but so be it. And you keep your mouth shut. We flew in together. From London, where I saw him with the Commander. I don't know what his task is, but it must be important. We can't leave him with this man. That's all I wanted to hear. Come with us. But I can't make any promises. You'll be staying with my sister, Kasia. I wasn't on the manifesto because I flew to Brindisi - without Tatar's consent. - Quiet! You're not in London! - I'll try to help. - There's no time. I keep waiting for the cast, the weather, the end of convalescence, - the consent, the plane, the contact... - Calm down! They can start the uprising without you. That's what I'm afraid of. Obersturmbannführer Steiger, Sturmbannführer Witze. You've sent a cargo plane for me. It's you? What a surprise! How was your journey? The stinking U-Boot or the freezing cargo plane? What am I doing here? I don't even speak Polish. I don't want to be rude, but I was to be relocated to Germany. I'm facing a death sentence here. It's about the Polish officer you met in London. We know that Kwiatkowski is in Warsaw. Am I supposed to wander around the city looking for the lieutenant? Is that your plan? Jarach knows where Kwiatkowski went in 1943. He'll be helping me? We had the courier, but he slipped away. He knows he is our number one target. You're our only hope, Miss Doris. I have a plan. I'll start by looking for a church. Think about it. Half a million soldiers we can arm to the teeth! They would be a perfect whip for the Russians. Poles hate them! They did hate them more than us. But that was in 1939. I'm afraid it's too late now. Heinrich Himmler disagrees. I don't think we should question him. Leave the rest to me. - Call someone from the organization. - The phones might be tapped. I'll find my old contact. - Wait for Marysia. - I can't just sit around here! - I won't be long. - I'm going. Take care. Stop! Papers, please! The control's over. - Move along. - We're on duty. So are we. Thank you. Everything's in order. Don't worry. We'll keep an eye on them. Thank you. Thank God you're here. I was looking for a contact, but I need your help. I checked again. We got no word from London that you're coming. I don't know what to do with you. Get me to Bór, plain and simple! Do you know his address? I don't. Bye. It's not that simple. - It takes time. - The uprising is coming. When it starts, it'll be too late. For everyone. I'll try to help you. But I have to warn you. It won't be easy. He is very insistent. But he seems honest. Lieutenant Wolski saw him in London, talking to the Commander. At some ball. I don't know... The arrest warrant looks authentic. He did not fly in from London. According to the manifesto, he wasn't on the plane. Nobody knows him. He wants to talk to Bór. It seems shady. What do you think? Forging a warrant is not that hard. Is his arm in a cast? What? No. It's not. Let Lutek take care of him. Just in case. Without a trial? We're at war. - Maybe he's a loony. - Maybe he's not. We have to protect Bór. I regret to inform you, that the Home Army Command followed the footsteps of its predecessors and left us in our time of need. They run away, like in 1939. I wonder where to. Madagascar! It's just Bolshevik propaganda! How do you know? - I just do! - Did you see them? - You're in for a bullet in the head. - Don't you threaten me. Moscow says we should unite against the Krauts. Am I a Bolshevik for wanting to kick German asses? I lost two sons at Pawiak. Don't threaten me! - Stop it! - Let's go. We know they're in Warsaw. Get going. Jellied pork and vodka. What are you doing? I just need a drink. I've been looking for you! Tomorrow, 11 AM, carriage 27, Plac Unii. Will I meet him or get the chop? One guy is already following me. Stop drinking. Good luck. Do you have a gun? This way, please. - Should I come back tomorrow? - No. Good morning. - The telephone? - In the back. Where have you been? We have to go. - Did it work? - No idea. I'll just take you there. He's here. 12 Krasińskich street. I can wait here, but for how long? Hurry. Stop! Germans! Run! Do you believe in dreams? Good luck. Do you have a gun? This way, please. Lieutenant Jan Nowak, reporting to the general. Any orders from the Commander in Chief? General Sosnkowski recommends avoiding the Soviets and retreating west. If we can seize... We know all about it from the wires. When did you see him? - On July 16th, in Brindisi. - Two weeks ago? Since then, the Soviets reached Praga. Do you know anything we don't? Top-secret microfilms are hidden in the handle. Thank you. Have a seat. In Moscow and Tehran, it was decided that occupation zones won't be created based on the final front line. Poland will fall under the Soviet rule. The presence of western Allies is out of the question. The Soviets can introduce their administration here. The Allies won't oppose it. They entered the war for us, and now they sold us to the Soviets. Unbelievable. I have a question. If we fight for Warsaw, can we count on weapon drops, the help of Sosabowski's brigade, and Polish RAF divisions bombing German positions? No. We don't have or our own parachute brigade. The English control it. It'll go to the Western Front. Polish divisions are a part of RAF. They're not autonomous. Warsaw is too far away from the Western Front to be of interest to the Allies. If we want military help, we can ask the Soviets. It's their territory. Why not the Eskimo? What do you think? Do the Allies understand what's going on here? You are overestimating their support. If Operation Tempest, the uprising in Warsaw, was designed as a political demonstration, it'll have no effect on the Allies' position. None! As for the public, it'll literally be a tempest in a teapot. Germans units are fumbling with the bridges. Probably they'll blow them up. Thank you. Keep me informed. Let's eat. Move it! Out! Faster! I have no doubts as to our fate after the Russians march in. I'd rather face the worst, than give everything up without a fight. We have to fulfill out duty. To the very end. How about you, lieutenant? What's your take on that? We have to fight. Hope the Soviets will help us and we'll win. If they fail us, and the Germans are too strong... We'll die honorably. If we lose, there's nothing left for us to do. Your opinion goes against the orders. I gave you the Commander's orders. But as to my opinion... I've been traveling across Poland. I know we're doomed without the Allies. But I also know there's nothing else we can do. If we fight, we don't know what our fate will be. But giving up for the first time in our history, will surely break the spirit of this nation. We'll do what the Germans couldn't, and the Soviets probably won't. We won't lose, we'll give up. And we'll keep giving up, until a total, brutal Sovietization. We'll pay for it dearly, for the benefit of future generations. Let us light this torch. This pyre. It's a pyre, general. - What is it? - A raid on 16 Krasińskiego street. We have to evacuate. You'll tell me the rest tomorrow. You have to stay with us, at Grottgera street. We need to wait. Most of them left an hour ago. Men in their 40s... Kwiatkowski? We can get him and another contact... Or... The "W" Hour begins tomorrow at 5 PM. - We'll meet here. - I'm sorry about your sister. We'll rescue her. Perhaps. - I'll go inform the others. - Wait. It's about my friend. Do you know what it means? Now? I do. There's no other way. I'm at Grottgera street. Home Army will be here tomorrow at 5 PM. Follow her. How? On an empty street? Move, you Polish swine! - It's five minutes to curfew. - I'm not going far. Let's go in. Now what? We'll shoot each other? My men are coming. You can't escape. Even if you shoot me. But you won't, will you? You've never shot anyone. But there's another way. My boss wants to talk to Bór. You could help us, and yourself. Your people are gone. You'll go with them. What a shame. Once again we meet in vain. You could help me. I just did. That's him. It's Kwiatkowski. - I didn't think he would stay. - Why? Doris is gone. So are four of our guards. If Bór doesn't arrive by 5 PM, we'll take Kwiatkowski down. Maybe Doris is there. Yes, sir. It's time. August 1, 1944. Tuesday, 5 PM. It's time. We're coming in. An uprising... Follow me! O Christmas Tree Follow me! In loving memory of Jan Nowak-Jeziorański. The courier from Warsaw whose life goal was the freedom of Poland.
