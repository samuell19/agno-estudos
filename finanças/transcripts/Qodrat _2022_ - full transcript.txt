I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Shaitan. In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate. And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And to Allah is the destination. I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Shaitan. In the name of Allah… …so fight against the allies of Shaitan. I seek forgiveness in Allah! In the name of Shaitan, I swore! You'll suffer from your guilt! Alif. Help me. Help me. I seek forgiveness in Allah. As Su'ala. Enemy of Allah. Praise be to Allah. In the dawn, you'll find sustenance. In the dawn, you'll find solutions. -Ath… -At-Talaq. Verses 2 and 3. I know that. Seek Allah's forgiveness, Qodrat. It's been almost three years since Allah gave you His blessing. To wake up each dawn. I never asked to be woken up. I also never asked to be released from this hell. Qodrat! I've been here for decades. You're the only inmate to get a remission. You'll soon be a free man. This blessing should make you remember -…that Allah… -I have nothing left out there. After Azizah. Then Alif. He took everything I had. Help! Help! Help! I already told you. You'll suffer for the rest of your life. The only way you can get out of this hell, Qodrat, is inside a body bag. As Su'ala! Qodrat! Help! Help! I seek forgiveness in Allah. -Hold him. -Let go. Quick! Qodrat, wake up! Allah is the greatest. Allah is the greatest. There is no god but Allah. There is no god but Allah. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Hasten to prayer. Hasten to prayer. Hasten to victory. Hasten to victory. Allah is the greatest. There's no god except Allah. Mama! Mama! Let's go! THIS LAND BELONGS TO PESANTREN KAHURIPAN LOCALS ARE NOT ALLOWED Come, hurry up. Come on. Thank you. How's Jihan? She's getting worse. She's even paler. She has a fever. She doesn't want to eat. She wakes up in the middle of the night screaming in pain. If not for you and the others… I wouldn't know what to do. Ti… Aside from coming to today's prayers, I also need to see you. Sorry, but I need you to pay back your debt to my late husband. I haven't paid my children's tuition for three months now. -The farm is not producing. No harvest. -Yas! You're not the only one. Nobody's farm in this village is producing any crops. Jihan! -Jihan! -Jihan. Jihan! Jihan! Jihan! I seek forgiveness in Allah. Jihan. Look at Mom! Enough! Enough, please! Have mercy on your mother! That's enough, Jihan! That's enough, my child! It's Mom. Please… that's enough, my love. I seek forgiveness in Allah. Enough. Jihan, enough! Enough, Jihan! Have mercy on your mother. Please. Jihan? Jihan? Jihan! My god, Jihan! Jihan! Jihan! Jihan! I seek forgiveness in Allah. One, two. -I hit it, right? -You're okay, right? -You're fine. -Come on, stand up. I told you, you'll be fine. Peace be unto you. Who are you? How dare you trespass here. -Pardon my intrusion. I'm… -Qodrat! Good Lord! Jafar. When did they let you out? I got a remission. Thank goodness. Jafar, why is the pesantren in this condition? Where's Kyai Rochim? Since you left… At first, he was fine. Even when he heard news about you, he'd be smiling proudly. Until… Until Alif's death three years ago. We're all convinced, that was not an ordinary accident. Every night he recited remembrances and did night prayers just for you. He neglected his own health. Then, one day, for no reason, he fell ill. The villagers started experiencing strange things. The crops were infested. Floods came. Diseases. Even evil disturbances. Were these attacks related to Kyai Rochim's illness? I don't know. What happened, Qodrat? You and your unbelievable gift. You, who never fails to exorcise people. You saved countless lives because of it. And this is what we got in return? What sin did you commit, that Alif became the victim? Ustadz. I have to go. You'll sleep at the pesantren? Yes. Forgive me, teacher. Mom, I'm full. The food was delicious. Why is your face like that? Nothing. -I just miss you, Alif. -If you miss me, why are you sad? You should smile. That's better. Why isn't my sister Asha home yet, Mom? So, you'll be playing with me, Mom? Go to bed after you've finished dinner. If you don't want to, I'm gonna play with Dad. Dad. Where is it, Dad? Alif. Go to bed now. What's his name, Dad? Who is with you, Dad? Alif? What are you doing? I'm playing with Dad. If you miss Dad, that's not how you play. Peace be unto you. And unto you peace. Where have you been? I told you before, Mom. I went to the plantation before going home. You shouldn't be out this late, Asha. You know how the village is nowadays. Stop exaggerating like the others, Mom. Asha. Jihan passed away this afternoon. -I went there for the prayers… -Mom. I told you, Jihan was sick. -She needed a doctor, not some spells! -Seek Allah's forgiveness, Asha! Those are prayers, not spells. What are spells? Have you eaten, Alif? Now go to sleep, Alif. I still want to talk to Mom. Having a talk or a fight? -A talk. -Sounds like a fight. Come on, go to sleep. The village is in a dire state. Crops failed. Many got sick. Now, Alif. Did you know? He's started talking to the wardrobe. He said he was playing with Dad. There are only the three of us now. I only have you and Alif. Why we should live like we're in prison? Alif… We have to believe everything will be better. Alif should have hope, not fear. We need money. That's why I kept trying to earn money. For your and Alif's tuitions. So you can go to college in town. So we won't have to sell Dad's plantations. What did you say? Your life is like a prison? I'm sure there are solutions for everything. But we shouldn't stay silent. We shouldn't lose to the fear that… Did you forget what happened because of your hope and courage for living? I know! Our family is not complete because of Asha, right? Alif is paralyzed because of me, right? If any… -Alif! -Alif! -Alif! -Alif! Alif! -Alif! -Let's move him. -Alif! -Alif! Alif! He's got a fever, Sha. -Alif! -I'll get a cold towel. -Make hot sweet tea too. -All right. Alif, wake up, son. Son. It's Mom. Wake up. Alif! Alif, do you hear me? Open your eyes. Alif! Alif. Yesterday, I went to the plantation because I missed Dad. Look, Alif. I drew this. Dad used to tell me stories. This was the yard for you to play in. Alif still has a fever? Yes, Mom. He still has a fever. Go to school, you'll be late. Sha, I'm… Me too, Mom. Me too. -Peace be unto you. -And unto you peace. Where's my wardrobe? I moved it into storage. We will buy a new one later. Alif, I made this for you. Have a bite. Come on, eat. Why did you do that? If you don't want it, just say so. I'll cook your favorite dish. Get some rest. Glory be to Allah and all praise be to Allah. There is none worthy of worship except Allah. Glory be to Allah and all praise be to Allah. Glory be to Allah… Where's Alif? -What is it, Mom? -Where's Alif? I don't know. He's not with me. Alif! Alif! -Alif! -Alif! -Alif! -I mean it. I'm not lying. Alif? I want to go with you. Really? We can just play together. I want to go with you. What are you doing here, Alif? We've been looking everywhere for you. Dad said that I don't need the others. Alif, that's enough. As long as I obey him, Dad said I can walk again. Dad is gone. He's dead! Don't talk trash about Dad! Alif! Alif, it's me! It's Mom, son! Dad is dead! Shut up, you bitch! I seek forgiveness in Allah! -Alif! -Mom! Why did you lock him up, Mom? Alif! Watch the door! Don't let him out. -Why are you leaving him? -Wait till I get back! Alif! Peace be unto you! Peace be unto you! Help! -And unto you peace. -Help. Just a moment. -I need to see Ustadz Jafar now! -Be calm, ma'am. Seek Allah's forgiveness. -How did you get wounded? -Where's Ustadz Jafar? He's out, I don't know where. Are you an Ustadz? My son is possessed. Please exorcise him. I beg you! Help him. Sorry, Ma'am. You can come back when Ustadz Jafar returns. -Excuse me. -I can pay you! As I said before, you can come back when Ustadz Jafar is back. -Please leave. -Please, Ustadz, I can't. -I'll give him your message. -I can't lose my son! Please help him, Ustadz! Please, help my son. Open up. Open the door, sis. What did I do wrong? Why are you mean like Mom? -Mom locked you up, not me. -Liar! You're the one who wants to lock me up. You and Mom always left me alone at home. No. I love you, Alif. If you love me, why don't you celebrate your birthday with the family? Dad and I went looking for you. I love you, Alif. If you love me, why did you make me paralyzed? If you love me, why did you cause the accident that night? Dad was right. You and Mom don't love me anymore. Dad's gone, Alif! Dad is here. You still don't believe me? Come see for yourself. Alif? Come here, sis. Come here. You said you loved me. Alif, come on out. Let's go home. I don't want to. I want to play with Dad. Listen to me, Alif. Come out now! All right. But give me back my feet! Let's put it here. Looks nice in here. Looks nice. We're busted, Mom. -Happy birthday, Asha. -Happy birthday, sweetie. Happy birthday, Asha. Dad and Alif were going to pick you up. But it seems my gorgeous daughter has come home. What's wrong, Asha? Tell Daddy all about it. Don't cry. May Asha be smarter, more mature, and a great and famous painter. And love Alif even more. And I hope we can always be together. So, I can always celebrate your birthday. Always, Dad. But now. Let's cut the cake. So all of our prayers and hopes can come true. What's wrong, Asha? I don't know. Suddenly, my hand hurts. If everything is all right… then come on, cut the cake. Come on. Try again. -But it hurts. -It's okay. Just do it slowly. Mom? Let me help. Don't stop. -But it hurts, Dad! -Again. -Mom. -Again! You don't want me to leave again, right? Don't want to lose me again, right? Then, cut the cake. Cut! Cut! Asha? Mom? Mom? Asha! Mom? Mom! I seek forgiveness in Allah. Asha… It hurts, Dad. In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate. There is neither might nor power but with Allah. Asha. Mom. Endure it, Asha. Endure it. I seek forgiveness in Allah. -Oh, Lord. -Alif. I seek forgiveness in Allah. Who are you? Alif. Who are you? Tell me your name! You're a hypocrite, Son of Adam! You call on Allah's name, but you have no faith in Him. You kneel to Allah, but you question His power. Alif! I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Shaitan. In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate. Those who believe do battle for the cause of Allah and those who disbelieve do battle for the cause of idols. So, fight the minions of the devil… You're beneath me! Remember, hypocrites belong in hell. …the devil's strategy is ever weak. Once again, tell me your name. Khadaab! What's your faith? Dajjalul Mustafan. I only worship Shaitan. I seek forgiveness in Allah. Alif! Glory be to Allah and all praise be to Allah. There is none worthy of worship except Allah, and Allah is the Greatest! You'll convert to Islam. With Allah's permission, leave this child's body. I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Shaitan. In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate. O company of jinn and men. If ye have the power to penetrate all regions of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate them! Ye will never penetrate them save with our sanction. Which is it, of the favors of your Lord, that ye deny? Just you wait! Soon, those who are stronger will come to destroy Muhammad's people. There is neither might nor power but with Allah. Alif? Alif! Thank you, Allah. My job is done. Thank you. Ustadz. Qodrat. My name is Qodrat. As Su'ala. Help me, Dad. What's wrong, Mom? Asha! Dear Lord. Dear Lord. Asha! Find Ustadz Qodrat. Quick! Mom! Mom? It's Alif. Mom? Good evening. We've come for Alif. Wait! Jafar? Where's Alif? Alif! Alif! Alif! -Alif! -Qodrat! -What are you doing? -I must save Alif. There's no time. Qodrat! Let's talk. -There's no time. I must save Alif. -Alif? -I must save him. -He's my responsibility now. You don't know who you're dealing with. He's a sorcerer. A direct descendant of Shaitan. As Su'ala. Jafar! Look at Alif, Jafar! Look! He is feasting on our faith! Our lives are just his playthings. The jinn I eradicated from Alif's body was only one of his henchmen. So, please. Let me exorcise Alif. Qodrat, every day I exorcise the villagers in this village, so I know more about… But that's the infidel jinn that murdered my son! He also tried to kill me in the prison. And now he's here in the village. Please. That's why I don't need your help. Look at that kid. He's Alif Amri. Not Alif Al-Fathanah. And for now, he's still breathing. Don't make the same mistake twice. Look deep within your heart. Are you helping in the name of Allah, or for your revenge? I testify there is no god except Allah. I testify Muhammad is Allah's messenger. Peace be unto you. Why us, Ustadz? Why Alif? Seek Allah's forgiveness, Sha. That's what Shaitan wants. For us to doubt Allah. Allah is the greatest. And Islam is the perfect religion. But you and me… We're weak. Every day, we breathe to reach heaven, but we forget. We don't realize we're full of sins. Is there a place for me in heaven? I have caused harm to the two people I love the most. Did you do it on purpose? Allah knows everything we have done. And everything we did will have consequences. But not in our human minds. We don't have the right to question. Allah won't burden humans beyond their limits. Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity. Each will enjoy what good he earns. You can recite the Qur'an? Praise be to Allah. -What are you doing here? -Peace unto you, sir. -Peace unto you. -You're from Pesantren Kahuripan? Yes, that's correct. So, you're one of Jafar's men. Tell him! My daughter is dead! So, there's no one to exorcise anymore. Wait, sir. I don't understand. If Jihan were alive and you still took our land and plantations, we'd still die anyway from starving because there's nothing left. -Do you know that? -Wait, sir. What land? The whole village knows! You're using religion for your greed! For wealth and money! Go away! Go away from here! The village has become a dreadful place because of your people! -Ustadz! -Enough, sir. Go away! Tanti! -Mom! -Sha, that's Alif. -Alif! -Praise be to Allah. -Thank you. -Your son has been healed. Thank goodness. Alif's exorcism went well. He can go home now. -What did you get from Yasmin's family? -Let's go. Money? Or a piece of their land? Who told you that nonsense? -That's slander. -That's blackmail. -They were gifts from the villagers. -You robbed them! -They gave it themselves. -If they don't give it, you won't help. Just like Tanti's daughter. It was only a matter of time for Jihan. -Many villagers need my help. -So, who do you help first? Those who can pay? Am I right? The land and plantations that I asked from them are for the new pesantren and a new mosque. You said it yourself, why is this pesantren a mess? I want to make this pesantren alive again. All of it is useless… if the people around here are living in misery because of you. Which is more important? A new pesantren or the greater good? Don't touch Yasmin's land and plantations. And never again ask for payment for exorcism. It's our duty, Jafar. Don't disgrace Kyai Rochim. Kobar. Go pack Ustadz Qodrat's things. He's too holy to stay here. Yes, Ustadz. What kind of horse gets tired the most? Sis? -I'm sorry, Alif. -No. -Alif, will you forgive me? -No. -Forgive me. You'll forgive me, right? -Yes, stop it. -Forgive me. -Stop it! Why aren't you asleep? -Mom, look at what Asha did. -Why me? Alif. Ustadz Jafar said a prayer over this water for you to drink. A spell, right? A prayer, not a spell. So, what is a spell? Say, "In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate," before drinking. Oh, you're right. "In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate." Sha. I need to talk to you about payment… Mom. -I'm gonna check it out. -I'm coming with you. Stay here with Asha. -Mom! -I'm here. Calm down. Where's Mom? What's taking her so long? -Alif, what horse… -No. -Wait here, Alif. -Sis! Sister! -Sis! -Just a moment, Alif. Mom? Mom? Sis? Is that Mom? -Mom? -Sis! Be patient, Alif. Mom? -Mom? -Asha? Is that Mom, sis? Mom? Asha. Mom? Why… Go to the pesantren now and find Ustadz Jafar. -Now, Mom? -Now, Asha. All right. Peace be upon you. Asha. Sister! Sis? Where are you, sis? Please forgive me, Kyai. I have to go. I'm ashamed that I can't do anything for this pesantren. Qodrat… Glory be to Allah. Kyai? Jafar… Idols. It's late. Kyai Rochim need his rest. -You should go now. -Kyai. -Wake up, Kyai. -Hey! -Where's Jafar? -Ustadz Jafar is busy, so please leave. Hey! Hey! Hey! Go home while you still can. Thank you. Jafar! I'll summon this spell for jinn and ghost. I worship Shaitan with all my heart. Give all your power to me. I made these sacrifices to please you. So, please receive it. Give me the power to rule the world. For all Shaitan… …jinn and ghost. I give it all to you. The soul of Alif Amri. Take it all to complete the ritual. I seek forgiveness in Allah. Welcome, Qodrat. Jafar, you infidels! Hypocrite! All of this time, you said Allah's name, but… Since when have you heard me reciting Allah's verses? I forget when the last time was that I said His name. All this time you lived off this pesantren and Kyai Rochim. This is how you repay him? Lived? Rats are alive too. Drink this blood. Follow me. We'll worship As Su'ala. You filth! One more time. Follow me. Worship As Su'ala. Or I'll force you to worship As Su'ala. We worship You, Allah, alone, and no one else. And only in Allah do I seek protection. Then it's your fate to die by my hand today! Ustadz! What are you doing to me, Mom? I can't move. Why can't I move, Mom? Enough, Mom. Help. Mom? -Mom? -Asha! Where's Alif, Mom? Where's Alif? A prophecy told me there'd be one of Muhammad's people who stood in the way of my misleading human souls. Where's Alif? Every time, I failed to kill you. Failed to overthrow your faith. But not today. I seek forgiveness in Allah. Peace be unto you, Ustadz Qodrat. Mom! In the name of Allah and Prophet Muhammad, where's Alif? Which Alif? The one whose neck I broke? Or the Alif I just buried alive? Alif! As Su'ala. Allah have mercy. I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Shaitan. In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate. Your god is one god; there is no god save Him. …the Beneficent, the Merciful. In the creation of the heavens and the earth. And the difference of night and day. And the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to men, and… Repent. I seek forgiveness in Allah. And the water which Allah sendeth down from the sky, thereby reviving the earth after its death, and dispersing all kinds of beasts therein, and in the ordinance of the winds and the clouds obedient between heaven and earth, are signs of Allah's sovereignty for people who have sense. In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate. Ustadz! I'll kill all religious men. So, no one will pray. And the sound of adhan will vanish. Allah is the best place for us to surrender. Our best protector and the best helper. Glory be to Allah and all praise be to Allah. There is none worthy of worship except Allah. And Allah is the Greatest. Glory be to Allah and all praise be to Allah. There is none worthy of worship except Allah. And Allah is the Greatest. I won't let you mock Allah's verse. I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Shaitan. In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate. Say O Muhammad: It is revealed unto me that a company of the Jinn gave ear. And they said: Lo! We have heard a marvelous Qur'an Allah is the greatest. I testify that there's no god except Allah. which guideth unto righteousness so we believe in it and we ascribe no partner unto our Lord. Mom! Asha. Asha. Where's Alif? Where's Alif, Sha? -Alif! -Mom! -Alif! -Mom! Dig him up! Alif! Dig, Sha. Get him out! Help me! -Help him, Asha! -Mom! Save him! Alif! Alif! My son! Wait for me! Wait for me! Asha! Help Alif! Quick! You came, Dad. I knew you'd come to find me. What's wrong, Dad? I'm scared. It's dark down there. Ustadz? I'm alone there. Please come with me, Dad. I don't want to lose you again. And we'll find Mom there. And we'll be together again. Please help me, Dad. Help me. Help me. Come on, Asha. I love you, Alif. I'll always miss you. I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Shaitan. In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate. All praise to be to Allah. Lord of all the Words. King of the Day of Judgment. You alone we worship, and to you alone turn for help. -Guide us, O Lord, to the straight path. -But we all belong to Allah. The path of those You blessed. -Not of those who… -And to Allah we shall return. Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Allah we shall return. Blasted human! If I can't destroy you, I'll make you lose everything! He said: Now, because Thou hast sent me astray, verily I shall lurk in ambush for them on Thy Right Path. I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Shaitan. And I came to them… -…from the front, behind them… -In the name of Allah… -…left and right. -Allah! There is no god but He. -And you'll find most of them ungrateful. -The Living, The Self-subsisting, Eternal. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permitted? He knoweth what appeareth to His creatures as… …before or after or behind them… …nor shall they encompass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His throne doth extend over the heavens and on earth. And on earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them… …for He is the most high. The Supreme in glory. With Allah's permission, come out from this child's body! Let Allah punish you in the afterlife! I testify that there's no god except Allah. And I testify that Prophet Muhammad is Allah's messenger. Allah is the greatest. There is neither might nor power but with Allah. -Alif! -Alif! Alif! Indeed, to Allah we belong, and to Allah we shall return. -Walk slowly, Kyai. -Let's go. Allah willing, I'll stay healthy. Can't you stay a little longer? Six months flies. -Peace be unto you, Kyai. -And peace unto you. And peace unto you. -Take care, Kyai Rochim. -All right. Almost every day we fixed up this pesantren. I lost track of time. It's time for me to go. The time has come for me to find out what happened to Azizah. This journey is a mandate for bearing the gift that Allah gave to you. But never forget this place, and don't hesitate to come back. Because this is your home. Allah willing. And for a while, before this old geezer… Let my old bike keep you company on your journey. Good Lord! -Thank you, Kyai. -You're welcome. -I'll be going now. -Take care. There's no one comparable to Him. Ustadz Qodrat! Mom? Ustadz Qodrat will be back, right?
