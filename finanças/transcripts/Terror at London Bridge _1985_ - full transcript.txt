(HOOF BEATS) (SCREAMING) (WHISTLE BLOWING) MAN: He's heading for the bridge. Don't let him get away. (WHISTLING) MAN: Come along, lads. Let's not lose him now. (GUNSHOTS FIRING) I still don't know why we're stopping here. We're just gonna be that much later getting to Vegas. There's something I want you to see. It's a very special tourist attraction. I hate tourist attractions. Oh, trust me, you'll be so glad you saw this one. WOMAN: Keep your eyes closed. MAN: This is silly. -I want you to get the full impact. -What? Okay. Okay. All right. You can open your eyes. There it is. (CHUCKLES) It's the real London Bridge. They brought it here all the way from England, stone by stone. Oh, I can't wait to walk across. Oh, hey, I am starving. We can walk across after we eat. Come on. There must be a restaurant around here that's still open. Thank you. I have been meaning to ask you, does everybody around here dress like that? I mean, this is the middle of the Arizona desert. Oh, sure. Half the village does. Local color. Well, are you folks coming to the big dedication tomorrow morning? Dedication? Yeah. Marks the final completion of the bridge. But I thought they completed it back in 1971. Except for one missing stone. Few months ago, they found the stone at the bottom of the Thames river. It's been down there for almost 100 years. So they shipped it over and fit it back in the bridge and tomorrow is the big dedication. Well, I'm afraid we're gonna have to miss that. We're leaving for Las Vegas in the morning. Right, hon? He's right. I guess we'll just have to miss it. Thank you. -Thank you. -Good night. We better get to the hotel. You said we could cross London Bridge. Hey, you read the gate sign. The whole place shuts down at 10:00. Everybody's supposed to be gone by 10:30. The bridge is closed. Besides, I'm worried we won't be able to get a hotel room this late. Honey, we can walk across the bridge in the morning before we leave. I wanna cross it tonight when it's all dark and empty and mysterious looking. Tell you what. You go check in first at the hotel, I'll be right over. I promise. -Promise? -Promise. You better hurry or we're not gonna get a room. (CLOCK CHIMING) Ow! Help! Somebody help me! Help! (SCREAMING) Help! (MARCHING BAND PLAYING) And now, as Lord Mayor of the city of London, I take great pride in officially unveiling this final stone, drawn up from the river Thames and dedicated here today to mark the true and final completion of London Bridge. (APPLAUDING) Thank you, my Lord Mayor. We are indeed honored by your presence here today. This stone, now officially placed, forms yet another link in the mighty chain of friendship forged between our two countries, Great Britain and the United States of America. As London Bridge itself symbolizes this enduring bond, a bond that extends for us... -Are you Peter Dawson, Chief of Police? -Yes. I was told to talk to you about my wife. I'm very worried about her. She didn't come back to the hotel. Tell you what, I'm on duty here now. Could it be possible for you to go down to the station? After the ceremony we can talk. But we'll talk now, damn it. My wife is missing. I demand that you do something about it. Get rid of him. Gregory. Gregory. You report it to me, right this way. We'll look into it. No... So what do you think of him? Of who? The new cop. Don Gregory. He's only been here a month from Chicago and he's single. Let's just have a seat in the shade here. Look, I'm Dave Williamson. Alice, well, she's my wife. We're just passing through on the way to Vegas. I left Alice here at the bridge a little after 10:00 last night. -Why'd you do that? -Well, she wanted to walk across. But I was exhausted and worried we wouldn't be able to book a room, so I took off to the hotel. She was gonna meet me there. Okay. What'd you do after that? I went straight to the hotel. I had been driving all day, I was really beat. I fell asleep waiting for Alice. When I woke up, it was daylight and she wasn't back. I went over to the police station, they told me to come here. Look, something's happened to her. I know it. Mr. Williamson, how much money did your wife have in her purse? That's what worries me. We were on our way to Vegas, planning on doing some gambling and Ally had a lot of cash in her purse. How much is a lot? Over $1,000. $1,000. We'll be in touch, okay? Don't worry about your wife. People don't just disappear in Havasu. Come. (MOTOR BOAT DRONING) (GASPS) My God! All right, you say you've never seen the woman before? No. No. Not... You okay? Take it easy. Yeah. It's just, I've never... I've never seen anybody who's been... I can understand that. You own the Lucky Lady? Yeah. I run river tours on the weekends and I hire up for fishing during the week. Who was she? She was a tourist. Her name is Alice Williamson. Why would anybody want to kill her? I don't know that yet. Is it okay if I go? I just can't think of anything else I might be able to tell you. Yeah, sure. I'll have one of my men drive you home. Uh, that's all right. My car is... It's here at the marina. I can drive myself. Are you sure you're okay? You seem pretty shaken. I'll be okay. Really. All right. We'll be in touch. Yeah. WOMAN: Officer Kennedy, please report to stairway location. MAN: This area is now under police control and is restricted to authorized personnel only. Hey, Don. Yeah. We got the prelim report back from the lab on the deceased. They found a fragment of clothing underneath one of her fingernails. Dawson thinks you better take a look at it. Okay, I'll stop by once I'm finished here. Did you find anything? Well, blood stains up there prove she was killed at the bridge. Body was pitched into the water and looks like the current traveled it to Thompson Bay. Yeah? Well, you got problems. Detective, I just talked to the City Council. They're very upset. -About what? -Well, closing the village. It's a fine time you picked to do it, too. I mean, yesterday we had everybody here. Major media coverage. Some of them are still here and you're driving them away. Mr. Whitfield, we're conducting a search in the investigation of a homicide. We can't have a herd of people stampeding through here while we're doing it. What do you expect to find? There's no mystery about it. Oh, really? The woman had cash in her purse. Her purse is missing. Obviously some passing transient killed her for the money, some road bum. Probably half way to Phoenix by now. You should have been a detective. Now look, Detective Gregory, I don't intend to argue with you. Now as head of the City Council, I demand that you reopen the village immediately. The village will be reopened once we complete the search and not a minute before. (EXHALES) I'm going to the Chief of Police with this. Well, you do that, Mr. Whitfield. You'll find out that I'm acting on his authority. Now, that is a mean man to have against you. He packs a lot of power in this town. I wasn't hired to promote local business, all right? Come on. We got a killer to catch. Just walk soft around the man. That's all I'm saying. I got it. I got it. MAN: Officer Barlow, check out the Chamber of Horrors. Elmore, Edwards, Cahill, cover the other shops along that side. This came from under the nail of the deceased's right forefinger. What about the clothing it came from? You got anything on that? Not yet. We're sending a fiber sample down to Phoenix. They should be able to help us. But let me show you something. Take a look at this. That's blood from Alice Williamson. -So? -So check this. That's blood, too, but not hers. Yet it came from the same blade. A fragment must have adhered to her throat. So it's possible this guy has killed before using the same weapon. Could be. Killer could have cut himself, blood could be his. But I don't make guesses. That's your department. Thanks a lot. I'll see you around. You'll let us know when you hear from Phoenix, won't you? You got it. Detective Gregory. Hi, I'm Elaine Gardner from the San Francisco Dispatch. -Hi. -I've been waiting here to talk with you. -How'd you get my address? -From Detective Nez. I told him I needed to speak to you after you got off from work. What about? The Williamson murder. I'm looking for personal angles. And since you're the officer in charge of the investigation... Weren't you at the bridge dedication yesterday? (CHUCKLES) That's what originally brought me down here to Havasu, the bridge story. But for this trip, I'm ending up with a much better one. Can we talk inside? I'd really appreciate getting your views on this case. As long as what I say is off the record. I don't want to be quoted. Agreed? Agreed. Now can we go inside? -Yeah, sure. I'm down at the end. -All right. (CLOCK CHIMING) Oh, there you are. Boy, did we screw up. What do you mean? I should've never given that reporter your address and you should've never talked to her. It's okay, pal. It was off the record. That's what she said. Damn it. The chief is very upset. Well, I can't understand why. -He wants to see you. -Mmm-hmm. BOTH: Now? Now. What the hell is this all about? I answered some questions off the record and the lady promised not to quote me. Sit down. Whitfield and the City Council people are convinced this was a random killing. Now you come out with a piece in the paper rejecting their theory. Told it the way I see it. (SIGHS) And just how is that? There's something weird about this murderer. I don't think Alice Williamson was killed for the money in her purse. What makes you say that? Pete, true crime happens to be a hobby of mine. I've been a student of criminal behavior all my life. Now I'm telling you the MO is all wrong here. If this was some road bum out to score her purse, he'd club his victim or flash a knife to scare her. He wouldn't cut her throat. That's a theory, Gregory. That's all it is. It's a theory and it's your theory. I don't want to see your theories in the newspaper. All right? It's Lake Havasu, it's not Chicago. Around here we do things my way. I mean, it's no big deal, we just do it my way. Hey. You read me, don't you? -Loud and clear. -Good. Out! (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yeah. We got the lab report in from Phoenix. And? It's a little spooky. I double checked on what they found and it's what they found. You'd better get over here. Okay, I'm hooked. Be right there. -Hi. -Hi. This is the report. This is the spooky part. Yeah, I see what you mean. You're absolutely certain this fabric comes from the last century? Absolutely. We don't have the lab equipment for dating fabric here in Havasu, but Phoenix does and I did double-check. It's just that your everyday killer doesn't run around wearing 100-year-old clothes. That's not all, there's the blood. You mean from Alice Williamson. No, the other fragment we found on her throat. Well, what about it? Well, judging from the texture and the coloration and the general composition of the fragment, it's old blood. How old? Well, there's no way to tell for certain. You can't date blood the way you can cloth, but if you a want a ball park estimate, it's possible that it's also from the last century. 100-year-old blood. Don't quote me. That's strictly unofficial. Like you said, spooky. See you. Thanks a lot. I thought maybe you wanted a ride home. Yes, thank you. Sorry. Come on. -So, you're checking out again. -That's right. How much do I owe you this time? You know, you're getting to be our best customer, coming and going the way you do. I know, three trips down here in the same month. But I think I've tracked everyone I need to. Are you doing another story about the murder for that newspaper of yours? No, this one's a feature for a major New York magazine, an exclusive. Uh, would you like me to call you a cab? Uh, no, thanks. I'm not going to the airport quite yet. I wanna prowl around some more, kind of get one last impression. -Well, suit yourself. -Bye-bye. Bye! Listen, you be careful, you hear? Here, in the shadow of this ancient bridge, at this place of violent murder, it's easy to imagine how Alice Williamson must've felt with the killer stalking her in the darkness. -I can feel the... -(THUDDING) (SIGHS) I can feel the vibrations of death here. Walking these dark streets alone, here in the village, is like being part of another era, another century, a violent time of disease, starvation and murder. (GASPS) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (PANTING) You all right? I'm sorry. I got carried away. You? I almost got carried away. Where the hell did you learn how to box like that? South side of Chicago, you learn real fast. Yeah? Uh. Wait, wait, wait. -You sure you're okay? -Yeah. The locker room's this way. I know. Well, you were pretty intense out there. Something bugging you? Remember that reporter who got me in trouble with Dawson? Yeah, what about her? Well, she came back in town again. Left a message on my answering machine, said she wanted to apologize for the news story. Asked me to phone her at the motel. So did you? Yeah, I did. I couldn't reach her. I checked back at the motel this morning, they said she left again last night. Gone back to Frisco. Yeah, that's what I figured so I phoned up there. They hadn't heard from her either. They don't know where she is. She took off on another story. Reporters do that, you know. Maybe. But she didn't use a rental car. And none of the local cabbies remember driving her to the airport. You think she's still in town? I don't know. I just hope she didn't run into the same weirdo Alice Williamson did. Hey, hey! Will you listen to yourself? You're letting the Williamson case get to you. Now look, you come out here from Chicago to ease up on your life. So why don't you take advantage of what we've got around here? We got the mountains, the lake, the desert. Come on, the only thing you've seen since you've been here is the back of your desk. What do you say? I say I think you're absolutely right. I could use some R&R. -All right. -Okay, thanks. I think I know just who to call. (TELEPHONE RINGING) (CLEARS THROAT) Hello? Hi, it's Don Gregory. Detective Gregory, yeah. Is this another official call? Nope, it's a personal one. Wanna make a reservation on your boat for Wednesday. -Oh, you wanna fish? -I sure do. Well, have you done much fishing? Are you kidding? I'm an old Lake Michigan boy. Okay. Well, just be at the marina about 8:00. We'll leave at 8:15 sharp. Got it? You got it. I'll be there. Oh, can I help you? I'm in need of lodging. You have rooms? I sure do. How long do you plan on staying? A while. Would you mind registering, sir? Just your name and address, please. No home address? I'm from overseas. I'm just visiting your country. Oh, first time over here? Yes. My first. Um, well, here's your key. Number 10, just down a few doors. -Good day. -Hello. My name is Roger Edington and you are? Lynn Chandler. A pleasure. And you are the librarian here? Yes, that's right. I happen to be fascinated with the past. Would you have anything on modern American history? Of course. Our history section is just right down there in Section D, to the left. Would you like me to show you? How very kind of you. Hope you don't mind my saying so, but I love your English accent. I take it you work in the village. My clothes. Yes, I am one of the Britishers recently imported to your fair city to, shall we say, help authenticate the atmosphere. At least the wage is attractive. Oh, you don't like it here? I miss London, terribly. And I may as well confess it, I am quite lonely here in your sunny Arizona. Dining alone, for instance. It's most disagreeable. Perhaps, at some future time, we might dine together. Or am I being too forward? No. (CHUCKLES) No, no. I... I think that would be very nice. Splendid. I really must be going. I didn't realize it was so late. No time for history today, I fear. Oh, well, the books are here. They'll be waiting for you when you want them. Thank you. I very much enjoyed our conversation. So did I. -Hey. -Hi. Did those books arrive from Phoenix? -Yeah, they just came in this morning. -Great. I was just gonna call you. Here's my card. I know who you are. So, you're going out with Angie on the boat, huh? How'd you know that? Oh, we're old pals. She mentioned your call. Yeah, I'm going out on Wednesday and give it a try. -Good luck. -Thank you. Howdy. Hi. Where's your gear? Back in Chicago. You do rent equipment, don't you? Oh, yeah. Sure we do. No problem. -Even got the bait. -Terrific. -Get the stern line, will you? -You got it. Excuse me. That's the stern line. (CHUCKLES) -I knew that. -Uh-huh. -Okay, we're off. -(MOTOR WHIRRING) Tom Hale. This is my wife, Lucy. Don Gregory. Looks like a good day for fishing, Greg. So you're an old hand, huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm an old hand. You got one of those... (LAUGHS) One of those. (VOCALIZING) An old Lake Michigan boy, huh? (SIGHS) I lied. I've never been fishing before in my life. -Then why are you out here? -Simple. I wanted to see you again, get to know you. You're not married, are you? No, I'm not married. I've been close a couple of times. As a matter of fact, I just had a relationship breakup before I came out here. You leave here or did she leave you? Little bit of both, I guess. Something happened on the job in Chicago and she couldn't handle it. What about you? Oh, my husband died about three years ago. Sorry. Rough, huh? Yeah, it was, for a while anyway. After his death, I went over and lived with my sister in Phoenix. And then I came out here. I got used to being alone. Now I like it. TOM: (LAUGHING) Hey, I got one. (DOOR CLOSES) -Who's there? -ANGIE: It's me. Oh, come on in. I'm almost finished. Hi. So, how did it go? How did what go? Your date with Don Gregory. My date! He pays me to take him fishing and he can't even fish. Proves it was a date. He was fishing for you. Mmm-hmm. You admit it. He's really a nice guy. I just get the feeling things move a little faster in Chicago, you know. Oh, Angie, what's holding you back? I don't know. I just don't think I'm ready for another heavy relationship right now, especially with a Chicago cop. Like Havasu cop. He asked me to go riding with him. You going? Maybe. Maybe not. So how's your love life? -Please. -(CHUCKLING) -But it could be about to improve. -Yeah? I just met this very British guy, I mean accent and everything. Talked about inviting me out for dinner. Talked about it? What does that mean? Well, you know how reserved the British are. But I think the next time he comes in for some books, he'll ask me out. Said he was real lonely here in Arizona. Does he work here in the village? Yeah. And my mother's birthday is coming up so I'll probably end up there. Oh, that'll be convenient. Yes, I mean, I may just bump into him. (LAUGHING) Who knows, maybe we'll both get lucky. You mean you're going riding. Well, I'm considering it. Okay, I'm done considering it. I'm going. WOMAN: Havasu Sun. Sorry, he's not available. He's in a meeting right now. Harry, you got that... So, why don't you tell the folks, Ed, that there's no further reason to fear any violence around here? Well, then you've solved the August 7th murder? We are absolutely satisfied Mrs. Williamson fell victim to a random act. Random, that means it won't happen again. But you don't have the killer. Oh, come on, Ed, if he were still in the area, we would have him by now. The guy was a transient, that means, this type of criminal, he strikes and then he splits, you know. When I interviewed Detective Gregory right after the crime, he rejected the theory of a transient killer. Yeah, well, I think... I think Don just about changed his mind on that score. What do you say, buddy boy? It's possible that a transient killed Alice Williamson. It's the only logical assumption, Don. Well, then that's what I'll write. Good, that about wraps it up then, Ed. Much obliged. See you down at the club. Come on. I was hoping you would back me up with a little more enthusiasm in there. I'm not much of a politician. I'm not asking for political posturing, Gregory. I'm asking for departmental loyalty. There is a difference, hotshot. Dawson has a right to be mad. Look, there's absolutely no reason to believe that this is anything other than a random killing. I got a reason. -What, your vanishing reporter? -Yep. Called the San Francisco newspaper. She hasn't showed up yet. They still don't know where she is. Are they worried? No. No, she's a freelancer really. Doesn't even work there. She just zips around chasing stories. There you go. Now, if they're not worried, why are you? I'd just like to know where she is. Oh. -Whoa! -Whoa! You wanna stop? I thought you'd never ask. Oh! It was fun, huh? I didn't know riding was so much work. You like to shoot? What? Shoot. You know, target shoot. It's kind of a hobby of mine. I'm not too bad at it either. Come on here. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you think? I'll get all three for three, huh? Go for it. Now let's see. One. I don't believe I missed that. I don't believe I missed the last one. -Pretty good. -Not too bad. Want to give it a try? -No, thanks. I'll pass. -Pass? I thought cops and guns went together like ham and eggs, right? No, thanks. Well, if you really don't want to, that's okay. Sit down for a second. Remember I told you that something happened on the job in Chicago? And everything went kind of haywire afterwards? Yeah, but you didn't say what it was. I shot a kid. I killed him. Wanna talk about it? Well, I haven't, with anybody. Not since it happened. Maybe you need to talk about it. This kid was robbing a liquor store. It was a night job. We got the call first, my partner took the street door and I went around back. That's when the kid came out, right at me. He had a sack of money and what... Sack of money in one hand, and what I thought was a gun in the other. You couldn't be sure? No, it was dark. It was raining really hard. One of those damn blinding Chicago thunderstorms. Anyway, when the kid came at me, I saw something flash in his right hand. So I fired. And I hit him in the chest. And he died later that night in the hospital. -And he didn't have a gun? -It was a can opener. Kid had sharpened the end of it. Naturally, there was a hassle. I was suspended for about a month. That's when Jen and I split up. When I went back on the force, I wasn't much good. I... I just wasn't functioning. I just wanted to get the hell out of Chicago and out of police work altogether. And this job came along. Well, look, everybody makes mistakes, cops make mistakes. Everybody does. I don't wanna ever have to fire a gun again. Angie, that kid, he was only 14. (SIGHS) * Phew! Hey. Thank you. -For what? -Well, for cheering me up. I feel a whole lot better, you know, spending time with you now. Good, I'm glad. I love desert nights, all the stars out, the clean air. A lot different from Chicago, huh? Yeah, different. That's the word for it. Look how beautiful the bridge is. -You know, I wanted to ask you a question. -Uh-oh. -More questions. -Yep. Whatever made you wanna become a cop? Well, my dad was a cop, his dad was a cop. Guess it just runs in the family. Seemed like the thing to do. Well, didn't you ever want to be anything else? You know, as a little boy? Well, sure I did, but I wasn't equipped to be one. Be what? Prima ballerina. (LAUGHS) How about you? What did you wanna be when you were a little girl? -Straight answer? -Straight answer. I wanted to be a psychiatrist, you know. I wanted to help people with their emotional problems. But I never went to college and Dad had this boat service and I just ended up taking it over. Well, you sure helped me. I mean, I've been pretty screwed up for quite a while now. I'm glad I found you. You mean that? * What do you think? Uh-uh. No, you're not supposed to touch them. The heat from human flesh can melt the wax. I'm sorry. It's just that I'm new here and I... Oh, well, we're very strict and if you break our rules, you must be punished. -Punished? -Yes. Well, follow me. I'll show you. This is Newgate Prison. And why are you taking me here? Well, to show you the punishment that could befall you if you touch the candles. See? While we're on the subject of punishment, may I ask, have you ever seriously considered the concept of good and evil? Well, yes, of course. Why? Could we talk? Go somewhere, away from all these people? Sure, we could walk along the river. It's quiet there. Yes, that would be charming. Obviously you're from England, right? Yes, from the London area. I left rather abruptly. Things are quite new to me here. And what about you? Do you live here, in Lake Havasu? Hmm-mmm, I'm the head librarian. I suppose you could say I've lived most of my life inside of books. Are you by chance a student of scripture? Oh, no. Not really. I'm not very religious. But you believe in punishment for breaking the law. Oh, yes, but... I was only joking back there. About Newgate Prison. You didn't think I was serious, did you? Punishment is always a serious matter and those who transgress must be dealt with. I have really enjoyed talking to you, but I should probably get back. I have to buy my mother a birthday present, in fact. You must listen to what I'm telling you. No. I must get back. You can't go. I won't allow it. I'm afraid you'll have to. You heard what the lady said. I'm so glad to see you. I leave you now, dear lady, but I trust we shall meet again. Sir. I feel like a princess that's just rescued from a dragon. I'm just glad I happened along when I did. He seemed to be upsetting you. You're just what I told my friend Angie you are, a real British gentleman. So you spoke of me to your friend. -I hope you don't mind. -Not at all. (SIGHS) That man really frightened me. It is true, my dear Lynn, that many people in life can be frightening. (MUFFLED SCREAMING) You guys are really lucky 'cause this entire area is rich in bird life. Now, the best know river duck is the Mallard. The male Mallard is identified by its green neck, while the female has a light brown... Look, Mr. Daly, there's a floating lady. Get back, children. Get back now. Get back, all of you. Go on, get back. Get way back, right now. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Come in. Thought you'd wanna see these. You think this boot print's significant, don't you? Yeah, we found that at the river bank, at a spot not far from the English village. It's where the killer dumped the body. How do you know that? Well, when he put her in the water, her scarf snagged on this branch, which ties the boot print directly to the killer. The depth of the impression of the boot shows that he was carrying the body at the time. So you think same guy did both, right? Yep, same MO and the lab report verifies the fact that the murder weapons are probably identical. I'm asking you for authorization to close down the village. Both murders are tied into that area. If I shut down the village, I catch hell from Whitfield, the City Council. And if you don't, more people are gonna be killed by this maniac. Pete, I'm telling you. He's out there. Look, I'm still concerned we haven't located that female reporter. And if I close down the village, I may as well close down the city because tourism is what this city is all about or haven't you noticed? I realize you're gonna get heat from Whitfield and his people, but we can't risk anymore lives here. You really believe this creep's gonna stop killing if I shut down the village? Ain't going to happen, man. Well, we won't know that until we try. At least no more women will be getting their throats cut on London Bridge. For how long do you want it closed? Till the killer's found. (SIGHS) It's no good. We don't know when or even if we're gonna catch the guy. Best I can do is post several plainclothes officers in the village. I cannot authorize its shutdown. You mean you won't, not can't. Hey, don't push it, hotshot. I do what I can. Yeah, sure you do. Sure you do. ANGIE: I just can't believe Lynn's dead. (SNIFFLING) We knew each other ever since high school, you know. We came here to Havasu together and she... She got... Why did it have to be Lynn? Did she say anything more about this British guy? No. (SIGHS) She didn't say anything else. Just that he worked in the village and he was a gentleman. Can't you ask this guard who saw this guy with Lynn? Can't he give you some kind of a physical description? The guard really didn't see the guy, only saw the back of him as he was leaving. He said he was sure that the guy didn't work there though. All we got is a height and a build. I'm worried about you. Are you gonna be okay? I could really use some company tonight. You got it. -Here, why don't you make yourself useful? -Yeah. Oh, looks good. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) -Hope you like trout. -Love it. Good. -Okay. -Yeah, dig in. Let me know what you think. Well? Oh, it's fine. You're a terrific cook. Just one of my many remarkable talents. Angie, remember I told you I had a theory about the killings? Well, I worked it out. Wanna hear it? Right after the funeral? Yeah, yeah, I know, but it's really important and I would really like to get your reaction. Okay. Okay, great. Let's start with the fragment of cloth found under Alice Williamson's fingernail. It proved to be over a century old. Now I think our killer bought an old coat from an antique shop, to match his identity. -What identity? -I'll get to that. Next. Take the way he killed his victims, by cutting their throats. My guess is he used a scalpel, surgeon's scalpel. I don't think I'm into this. Just bear with me for a little while, okay? Consider the two dates, the two known killings. August 7th, September 8th. Are they significant? Once you add a third date, they are. August 31st. So what's so special about August 31st? August 31st was the last night that the reporter Elaine Gardner was seen, when she checked out of the motel. Angie, I think she died at the hands of our killer that night. It's just that we haven't found the body. Now, the dates in order are August 7th, August 31st, September 8th. Okay, so? They match the dates of the first three murders attributed to Jack the Ripper in London's Whitechapel District in 1888. Between August 7th and November 9th, six women were murdered in that area. The killer disappeared that year. Now theory has it that there was a man shot by police on London Bridge who died in the Thames river in November 1888. Theory has it that that man was The Ripper. So what does all of that have to do... Don't you see? Our killer wears period clothing, he uses a surgeon's scalpel, he cuts his victims' throats and he strikes in the area of the London Bridge. Angie, the guy we're looking for actually thinks he's Jack the Ripper. That's some theory. Well, it makes sense. I mean, everything fits. What do you think Chief Dawson's gonna say when you tell him? I already have. He thinks Chicago cops, they got bizarre imaginations. -He didn't buy it? -No, he didn't. Not yet. But he will. -Well, so what are you gonna do? -I don't know. I do know one thing. If our killer follows his murder pattern, he'll strike again on September 30th. I wouldn't bet it's over. Forgot the wine. I'll be right back. Excuse me, Mr. Whitfield, we got to talk. Not now, I'm late for a meeting. -I'm really sorry but this is urgent. -All right. -Now what do you want? -I want you to close down the village. -For another search? -No, sir. For the safety of the public. There's been two known murders in the area and there may have been a third. Now, did Chief Dawson order the village closed? No, I'm asking you to do this voluntarily as a gesture of public safety. Public safety is your responsibility, it is not mine. That's what the City pays you for. Now, unless Chief Dawson personally orders me to close that village, it stays open. Your attitude stinks, man. No, I'm gonna tell you what stinks. It's your record. Now you didn't fit in back in Chicago and you don't fit in here either. You're unstable. You're a misfit. I know all about you. I've checked your record. I know about the 14-year-old kid you blew away in Chicago. Whoa, whoa. You're finished in this town, mister. I can promise you that. All right. You'll be all right. Hey. Hey. Hey. What was that all about? I almost decked Whitfield. He was way out of line. How could you even think about decking the head of the City Council, Gregory? I'm sorry, Chief, but the guy's an A number one jerk. All right. All right. We'll talk about that later. Right now I want you with me. Ed Nebel, down at the paper, says he got a crank letter. He thinks we ought to see it. Joe, you take the car back. You come with me. So, what you got for us, Ed? Our first crackpot poem. I guess I ought to frame it. Now, Whitfield has been putting a lot of pressure on me not to put any stuff about the killings in the paper, but I got to print this. Whoever this joker is, he can't add very well. There's been two murders, not three. He is right. There have been three. So how do you figure that? There's Alice Williamson, Lynn Chandler... And the reporter. Elaine Gardner. It says it all, guys. This line right here. "The stone has told me there'll be more." And after what you almost did to Whitfield, this letter, the only reason I'm not kicking your butt off the case. However, we do know there is a copycat Ripper out there somewhere. Yeah. And that he killed Elaine Gardner. Yeah, could be. Could be. -You know San Francisco called? -Hmm. Come here. They definitely verified the Gardner woman is missing. You got to trace out on her, so that means, if she's dead, we got three. You think it's a good idea for Nebel to run this? Sure. Why not? Let's give our resident weirdo some exposure. That's what he wants. Might draw him out. The public needs to know. Hey, Gregory, you want to do me a favor? What does that mean? "The stone has told me there will be more." I don't know what the stone part means, but I do know one thing, we gotta move fast, because if his guy follows Ripper's pattern, he'll strike again on September 30th. (DOOR CLOSES) (SIREN WAILING) -Hi. Are you Ms. Alma Bellock? -That's right. My name is Detective Gregory. You placed a call to us? You're in charge of the murders, aren't you? Yes. I'm the chief investigating officer and this is Detective Nez. -How do you do? -Hi. I think I know who he is. The killer. The one you're all looking for. Tell us what you know. Well, it's the guy in number 10, Mr. Latting. He keeps real odd hours and mostly goes out at night. He talked to me funny once about how he thinks there's a curse on London Bridge and how it's an evil place that reeks with murder. Yeah. That's the way he said it. Just like that. He thinks it should be torn down. Do you know where Mr. Latting is now? No, I don't know. But I saw him leaving with a suitcase just a little before I called you. Why didn't you call us before? Well, I just never thought to. I mean, I never connected him in my mind with the murders until I saw the big story in the paper about another Jack the Ripper. That's when I thought about him. Could you give us the key to the room? Oh, it's real close. Come on, I'll show you. Come on. Follow me. It's real close. I told you. He's gone. Gone? How could he be gone? Anson, he can't get far. I got the whole area bottled up, the airport, both ends on 95, the river. My cops, just patrolling the whole desert out there. Yeah, but he was there all these weeks, right under your nose, middle of town. Psycho killer, obvious mad man. There's nothing obvious about this man. He may be a weirdo, but I'm not convinced he's the man we're after either. Oh, you're not. You just don't want to admit you let him slip past you. You know, you've been running this case like a blind fool. What the hell is he doing in here? This is police business. You want to know what I'm doing here? I'll be happy to tell you. I came here to deliver a petition, signed and approved by the City Council, to have you fired, Gregory. And this latest blunder of yours puts a seal on it. Now, I trust Chief Dawson will take immediate action. (DOOR CLOSES) All right, Pete, what's the action? Do I stay or do I go? You stay. For now, you stay. I'm rejecting their petition, but you're walking a tight rope, Gregory. I've never seen the people in this town so stirred up. You make one more wrong step, just one, you gotta go. I understand that. How did it go? Don't ask. Just saw your pal Whitfield storming out of here, like he had a burr under his saddle. Yeah, he's out to nail me all right. I'm not worried about him. Well, you're worried about something. One other aspect is there. What aspect? I don't know. I'm gonna go to the research library in Phoenix and check out a few things. Phoenix? (VEHICLE APPROACHING) (CAR DOOR SHUTS) (DOORBELL RINGING) Angie? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Angie? ANGIE: Don, is that you? Yeah. -Hi. -Hi. What are you doing? It's almost morning. Look, I've been up all night. I just drove back from Phoenix. -You got some coffee? -Yeah. Come in. Thanks. It's not real hot but it's all I have. That's fine. I guess I needed that. Why don't you come over here and sit down? We gotta talk. Or at least I do. What happened? Another murder? No. No. No more murders. Not yet. Angie, it's what I've come to believe, it's making me crazy. I can't tell anyone else about this. Only you. And when I tell you, you're gonna think I've flipped. -I'm listening. -(SIGHS) Okay. First, there were traces of blood found on the skin of both victims. Blood other than their own. Old blood, very old blood. Which probably means the killer used the same weapon a long time ago. Okay? -Okay. -Okay. Now, take a look at this. Take a look at this. Two photographs of a boot print. What do you see? Well, they're obviously from the same boot. It has a same sort of odd heel sole pattern in both of them. The glossy is brand new. It's a photograph of our killer's boot print. The photo in this magazine was taken in 1888 at the scene of one of The Ripper murders. They're identical. Like you said, same boot. Right? But I don't see how... This is the copy of the note sent to our local newspaper by the killer. This is a letter written by Jack the Ripper, sent to a London newspaper in 1888 after one of his murders. This is exactly the same handwriting. I mean, this is exactly the same writing in both of these. It's because the same man wrote both of them. What're you saying? What I'm saying is, God help me, there never was a copycat killer. The man who butchered Alice Williamson and Lynn Chandler was the real Jack the Ripper. Don, that's totally impossible. Which is exactly what I've been telling myself. Take a look at this line. "The stone has told me there will be more." Okay, so what? I'm now convinced he's referring to the stone brought back from the Thames river. Don't you see? The first murder was committed during the 24-hour period in which the stone was being dedicated. It's the key to everything. I'm sorry, I don't follow you. Angie, somehow, as weird as it sounds, the stone is tied into everything. When they brought that thing back from the bottom of the Thames river, they brought him with it. And he's here, in our century, repeating the same murder pattern all over again. Listen, whoever this psycho is, he's not Jack the Ripper. He can't be, not the Jack the Ripper. Don, stones don't bring people back to life. Okay. Okay, whether you believe me or not, that's not important. What is important is that I need your help. Well, yes, of course. But... Look, I got a plan. But I'm gonna need you to help me and I'm gonna need Joe. Because, I'm telling you, he's out there and we gotta stop him. And he's ready to kill again. The evil here must be destroyed. Tonight it shall be scourged by fire and brimstone. Hey, you. Freeze! (GUNSHOTS FIRED) Keep back. Satan rules this place of darkness. His abode of evil and must be destroyed. -No! -(GRUNTING) Back off! Do it. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot. This is an unclean place. A place of evil, a place of murder, by those who serve Satan. There is evil here. It must be cleansed. I work for the higher power. Well, you are out of work now. So there's your Ripper, hotshot. He doesn't look so scary to me. What about you? That's not him. Are you serious? He's not our killer, Pete. The hell he's not! The Bellock woman positively identified him as Latting. The village guard was a 100% certain that's the same guy that did the death walk with Chandler. What about the clippings? What about the clippings in his stuff? What do you say to that? I ran a 29 on him. Two assaults, convicted both times. He spent three years in mental hospitals, he tried to burn down a church. He's a psycho, Gregory, a certified psycho. He may be a psycho, but he's not out killer. Well, then who is? You won't believe me when I tell you. Why don't you try me? Just tell me, Don. All right. There never was a copycat killer, Pete. Only the real one. What are you saying? What are you talking about? Jack the Ripper. He's alive and he's right here in Havasu. You're talking about the guy from 1888? Yeah. Well, he is an active dude, boy. I mean, he gotta be pushing what, 140. Takes lot of vitamins. I told you you wouldn't believe me. I didn't expect you to. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. What's the matter? Are you okay? -Oh, absolutely. -You don't seem all right. Listen to me. Listen to me now. Three nights from now he's gonna strike again. -You got to go home, boy. -September 30th... Joe! Joe, get in here. (SCREAMING) ANGIE: Hi. How do you feel? I feel like Rip Van Winkle. -How long have I been out? -Ever since they brought you in. It's been three days now. You had a severe concussion, Don. Well, you blacked out in the jail. Hi, Joe. How you doing, partner? How long have you guys been here anyway? I don't know, like couple of hours, I guess. The doctor called, they said you were saying our names, and he figured that if you woke up and saw us, it'd be easier for you. You know, familiar faces and all. I was having this dream about you guys, as though all three of us were together, hmm. And we were... We were trapped and we were gonna die! Come on, come on. Take it easy. I'm gonna go get a nurse. No. I'm all right. I don't need a nurse. I'm all right. Wait a minute. I've been out for three days. What's today's date? It's Monday. It's the 30th. The 30th. He's gonna kill again. He's gonna kill again tonight. Nobody's gonna kill anybody. We caught him, remember? We didn't catch him. We didn't catch The Ripper. Don, look, I was talking to Joe about your theory and... We think you've been under a lot of strain. He's out there, damn it, Angie. He's out there. Joe? Okay. So you don't believe me any more than Dawson believes me. But you promised to help me. Well, yes. I had a plan to catch the killer, remember? You promised to help me. There ain't nobody to catch. I can prove it. You guys are the only people I can trust here. Look, we are running out of time. We gotta do this tonight. Joe? Will you help me, buddy? Angie? Will you help me? All right. Looks like the guard's not here. I'll find him and keep him out of this. Remember, you stay well hidden in that boat, man. We gotta make him believe that Angie's alone. All right. Take off. (BOTH GRUNTING) (MOTOR WHIRRING) Don wants me to meet him on the steps. I'm supposed to be the decoy. (SIGHS) I can't believe we're doing this. DON: Angie. Angie. Okay. There he is. Be back in a second. All right. Joe! Hey! Oh! (GRUNTING) (PANTING) Operator. (SCREAMING) Good evening. I've never had the opportunity before to introduce one of my ladies to another. Therefore, dear Angie, may I present Elaine. No! No! No! No! No! No! The stone will receive your blood, Angie. Its powers will be renewed through you. Your blood will allow me to return, to go back to my century. (CLOCK CHIMING) It's time now, Angie. (GRUNTING) Come, Angie. (GRUNTING) Say goodbye to dear Angie. Don, shoot him. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's over. It's over. (ANGIE PANTING)
