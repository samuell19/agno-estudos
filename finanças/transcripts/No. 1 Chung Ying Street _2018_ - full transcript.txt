Of course don't you think siao fong fong is so cool? The lady killer the artificial flower factory incident in tai yau street, San po Kong, is a continuation of history as long as we haven't reunited with the motherland the British will continue to take advantage of us they will continue to exploit our workforce so chun man I know that last week the federation of trade unions set up the Hong Kong-kowloon committee for anti-Hong Kong British persecution struggle although I live in a faraway place in sha tau kok our union there is joining the fight that's right if we don't fight for our future now we'll just end up like the workers today when we graduate students, stand up if you want to lend a hand I didn't expect so many of you were willing to distribute leaflets good he was smiling at you hey li lai wah, fong su ching we're planning for a party at my place after the exam why don't you join us? - Sounds good - sure - but... - But what?

My father said they moved in only when those people made trouble first but my father didn't think so right Hong Kong people shouldn't beat Hong Kong people the yellow-skinned dogs are traitors to the motherland they willingly become the slaves of imperialism I get angry just talking about it but if the police won't keep the peace Hong Kong will be like mainland China the police should serve the people but not for an authority which rules with an iron fist and through opium do you really believe that Hong Kong is better off if it's returned to China? You only live in your own world without any idea of how people suffer hey on the day after our exam I'll have a party at home why don't you join us since you can go back with lai wah? I can give both of you a ride home alright that's a deal su ching's father is a police officer she said that the police moved in only when the crowd broke through the barriers can you believe them, the yellow-skinned dogs? Can you stop calling them yellow-skinned dogs? Your father and uncle always call them such nonsense don't you think it's highly disrespectful? Just study hard for your university entrance exam you'll then become a perfect match do you think women study hard just because they want to get married? I study hard for the university because I don't want to spend the rest of my life in sha tau kok I want to go see the world, look at different architecture the world is huge. Do you know that? Bigger than the great chairman mao in your heart enough said it's not necessary to mention chairman mao I'm not talking to you excuse me be quiet... be quiet... I'll let go if you keep quiet be quiet... I'll let go if you keep quiet - let me go - calm down calm down I won't tell the police... l wont...

Cheung wing kuen so chun man my ancestors were just like you they came from the mainland we're compatriots after all my old man always says now that we're in Hong Kong we won't be able to survive if we don't look out for each other this old house belongs to my uncle he has gone to Holland to make a living not sure when he'll be back you can stay here for now I want to find work I want to make money buy palmier pastries for my mother you came to Hong Kong only for the money?

Me... San po Kong - San po Kong - that's right he told me he couldn't stand how the British Hong Kong capitalists take advantage of the workers the police only care about taking bribes it's also for a better Hong Kong that he came to the rally in sha tau kok today that's right, I want a better Hong Kong absolutely we can't let the British colonial government - go on like this - that's right down with the British colonial government uphold workers’ rights down with the British colonial government uphold workers’ rights I can't get it hey. Why are you keeping to yourselves here? I don't like to be quiet I go dance I like to know do you come from a manchu noble family? You've a big collection of national treasures my grandfather was a rag-and-bone man in the mainland my father followed him around to collect old stuff national treasures or not they're just making a living when did your family come to Hong Kong? When they were fighting the Japanese my father said all these antiques would have been gone if we didn't bring them along westerners love all things oriental we never expected these antiques would fetch higher prices in Hong Kong is that why you don't approve of chun man and the others being anti-British? What are you trying to say? Aren't you doing business with the British? Do you think my priority is always whether it'll harm my family's business? Hm is it not? I would think so it's getting really late how come chun man hasn't got here yet? But he's always like this, absent-minded perhaps he's busy right. Chun man and you... are you... What is it? That the two of you... That the two of us... Are a couple of childhood friends, like brothers why did you ask? Nothing shall we dance? Do you have any medicated oil for sprains? In the drawer sit down first the middle one? That's right bear with me you can treat a sprain? You will when you often get beaten up forget it Hong Kong people won't get it done you're classified as the black five? Hong Kong will classify people as such too? I only heard about it I thought there won't be any more struggles when I got to Hong Kong it's the same everywhere hey we're only asking the employers to treat their workers fairly do you know that many workers work 362 days a year in Hong Kong? The first three days of Chinese new year are their only holidays but at least you've got food and you don't get beaten up we can't go any further, young master what brought you here to sha tau kok at this late hour? - 1... - Great-uncle! Lai wah? Are you alright? This is my schoolmate, chi ho did you know that something happened in sha tau kok today? Better get home quickly what has happened? Ask your father when you get home great-uncle, is it possible to drive lai wah all the way home? You don't have the closed area permit. I can't help you right. I can walk from here. Great-uncle! I'll just walk her home and come back straight away back in a jiffy! Thank you, great-uncle!

Sure I don't have a phone at home how could I get in touch? But there's one in our store mom! Auntie! What's going on? Chun man, his father and your father didn't come home I always ask them not to make trouble. They never listened now even the son is involved you can't really blame uncle. Chun man's school is also very active active in what sense? "Against the British and brutality” they ain't starving. "Against the British and brutality" what if they got arrested? I don't want my son to have a criminal record the news reports say that those people are beaten badly by the police, until their heads are covered with blood. Don't worry. It'll be fine. If you see chun man, help me talk him out of it he listens to you since he was very young remember to talk to him. He's my only son don't worry what are you doing? Hurry up! What are you doing? I'm not going back are you crazy? The village chief is expecting us we'll meet at tung wo school should anything happen I'm turning back are you crazy? Where else can you go? I can't even go home I haven't eaten we always cross back and forth like this since I was very young it's nothing listen to me you crossed over once. You don't believe you could do it a second time? Come on long live chairman mao! Long live chairman mao! Village chief! What happened to your foot, chun man? Nothing. Just a sprain - thank you so much - you're welcome we're one big family. Feel free to ask if you need help thank you, chief! Thank you, uncle! Thanks thanks thanks thanks wing kuen, do you know how to farm? I know. When I was very young... When he was very young, he used to farm in San po Kong right, San po Kong great. I'm always short-handed on the farm many people have left sha tau kok to work overseas come help me out if you've time thank you, chief thanks let's eat capitalism allows the economic exploitation of labour force enabling capitalists to accumulate their wealth imperialism in the form of colonialism imposes such evil system on the colonised workers chairman mao teaches us have you seen my father? He's with me now. Don't worry when are you coming back? What? When are you coming back? We'll counter-attack Hong Kong very soon. Don't worry - your mother is so worried about you. - Can you bring me - she doesn't want you to get involved anymore - two white flower medicated qil? What? Two bottles... Your mother is so worried about you. She doesn't want you to get involved anymore alright. Let's get going. Talk later. Sei, do you still feel dizzy at the moment? A bit take good care of yourself, you know? I know take care ah chat, canvas shoes are almost out of stock go get some from sheung shui sure mom have you got the prunella? Mom, I just saw chun man across the street from San lau street did you see your father? They're together and safe. Don't worry I'm not worried. If he could survive the war, nothing could go wrong for him I can't believe you the British must go! We shall overcome! After more than a hundred years of British colonial rule in Hong Kong a lot of poisonous thoughts have been planted in people down with the British colonial government! Believe in chairman mao! To eradicate such poisonous thoughts, we must first launch a propaganda with correct ideology let's charge ahead! The great chairman mao once said "the world is yours as well as ours" the British must go! We shall overcome! This is PC 5218 sha tau kok police post no.3 about 100 demonstrators from the Chinese side are crossing the border in sha tau kok calling for immediate backup. Over! Down with the yellow-skinned dogs! Who's willing to take the charge for the motherland? Me! My name is cheung chi chung. I'm willing to work for chairman mao and for the motherland long live China! Long live China! Me too! Me too! Down with the yellow-skinned dogs! This is delta no.2 commander shau tau kok and the rural committee building are under gunfire attack more than one officer was shot. Over! This morning about 300 mainland Chinese surged across the border at sha tau kok shouting slogans rapid gunfire was exchanged with the Hong Kong police force at sha tau kok's chung ying street police post and around the rural committee building the mainland militia even set up machine guns on the Chinese side of the border and opened fire at the rural committee building the Hong Kong police had to call on the Gurkhas to end the scuffle five police officers are certified dead several more officers are sent to the hospital for treatment don't worry. Your father won't die mom, do you think it's right or wrong, what father is doing? You can't tell yet for certain things just like fortune telling when god che kung tells you your fortune at the beginning of the year is it really that way? We wouldn't know until we look back at the end of the year what are you trying to say? You're too young to get it forget it aren't you going out with your schoolmates? Not in the mood. I'm not going they don't care about what we think they'll do what they want to do why should you be so unhappy because of them? I can't believe it. That's your husband you can't rely on anyone but yourself you can make yourself happy you can also make yourself unhappy why should you make yourself unhappy? Come on, your schoolmates are waiting for you - one - two - three - four - five - six - seven - eight - nine - ten - Jack - queen! Cut the cards! Look, what's written here? "Let's gather the masses and further expand the anti-British forces" these leftists are crazy people there's an explosion in a leftist school earlier a student lost his arm from the explosion. Unbelievable my father said that the police have also arrested fu qi and shi hui! - Both of them? - Seriously! Are you bored? Let's get some fresh air? My father hasn't been home for three weeks not a word from chun man. I'm so worried I don't really get it neither do I. I don't get it why they're so into it. My father was with the guerrilla forces against the Japanese he often told me that the British were useless they fled and abandoned Hong Kong when the Japanese attacked us but they came back to reclaim Hong Kong after the Japanese was defeated even the fire fighters were corrupted they wouldn't put out the fire if they don't get the bribes but I heard that when the Japanese attacked Hong Kong the British and the Canadians joined forces against the Japanese. Many of them died Hong Kong workers weren't any better! Chun man said the new China helped the farmers and workers let them hold their heads high liberate them from capitalist oppression do you really believe in what chun man said? I don't mean he's lying but if the new China is really that great like he said why are there still so many refugees coming to Hong Kong every day? I really don't know then do you know that I've been waiting for your call since the shootings in sha tau kok? Lai wah I'm really worried about you ah... do you think is there any other way to look for chun man and my father? Sorry, I shouldn't have picked this moment... Why don't we ask all the unions? Thanks not at all that's enough you couldn't have eaten much the last few days we revolutionaries are not afraid of hardship and death revolutionaries also need to eat - I'm full - dad! We're so worried about you silly girl, your dad won't easily die luckily that you've switched your identity card with your brother what about chun man and the others? Sha tau kok is not safe now. They went to Hong Kong helping out at the unions where are they? You're a girl. Just study hard and mind your own business. Then why did you get chun man involved? Boys are not the same why are we different? British women have the right to vote your communism advocates equality for all, isn't it? I asked your father not to get you involved mom lai wah, we just want to keep you safe then you shouldn't take part too I'm different. I fought in the war before you say the same thing again you were so worried about your father now that he's back, shouldn't we be happy? Hello? Miss, the call is for you thanks. Hello? Hello, lai wah. Someone got me a list of the unions in Hong Kong and kowloon perhaps we could find uncle there there's no need. My father has come home chun mun and the others went to Hong Kong no longer in sha tau kok oh, good that he's back but I'm still worried about chun man and his father my father won't tell us where exactly they are why don't we go look for them together? Sure. Let's go to Hong Kong together? That's right. We follow the list and drop by the unions one by one on July 9, dock worker Cheng chit po and cargo handler ma lit came across a student being beaten up by the riot police in des voeux road west they came forward to rescue the student the student got away but Cheng chit po and ma lit were shot dead. The two of you... Hi, we're looking for someone called so chun man have you heard of him? No. Who are you? We're his friends he has disappeared since July 8 after the shau tau kok incident someone told us he went to Hong Kong island that's why we came here to look for him can we still tolerate the white-skinned pigs and yellow-skinned dogs who murder our fellow workers and arrest our leaders? No, of course not! We're in a meeting. Why don't you write down his name? After the riot police raided the union at the dock lots of people came here to look for their families his name is already written here. My number too please let us know if you've news thanks thanks excuse me? Why are you following me? We've a friend who is with the union just wanted to know if you've seen him please let go of him what's his name? So chun man no he's from shau tau kok. No surprise that you don't know him shau tau kok? Did he kill the five cops? I don't know how can I trust you? We're really from sha tau kok young master! How dare you beat my young master! No, uncle ku. He didn't beat me. Just a misunderstanding so chun man? We went to lots of unions. No one has heard of him you couldn't possibly find him this way please let us know if you've news of him I'll let you know if I run into him young master I'll only drive you home from now on nowhere else auntie, don't be like that lai wah, I beg you. Please tell me kin fung and chun man, where are they now? Your father told us they're now safe but people are dying all around us how could they be safe? Dad said they went to Hong Kong don't worry. It'll be alright should anything happen, dad will let us know right? Should anything happen... Should anything happen to them I don't want to live an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth down with the British colonial government. Reinstate Chinese authority believe in chairman mao. Obey chairman mao many people have died. The British still won't stop if Hong Kong is now returned to China what would the other British colonies think? International affairs are not that simple uncle, if you think nothing much could be changed despite all you've done why are you still doing it? Changes are not brought about by just one struggle before the wuchang uprising there were the qinuhu uprising and the huanghuagang uprising changes are brought upon by a small group of people first many people were killed during the huanghuagang uprising aren't you scared? How can we not be scared? But when you really love a place and really love the people there you'll spare no effort in protecting it reinstate Chinese authority! Believe in chairman mao! - Obey chairman mao! - Chun man, I need to pee long live chairman mao! Reinstate Chinese authority! Believe in chairman mao! Obey chairman mao! Long live chairman mao! - An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. - Down with the yellow-skinned dogs! Stop it! Don't throw! Run! Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! Shot? Fairy tower, pokfulam? I'll be right there. - I'm going out - where are you going? What's up? Nothing mom, I'm done. I'm going home take the duvet out, under the sun sure grandma chan, may I use your phone? Hello? Hello, mom? Sorry, I'm looking for kwok chi ho yes. What's up? I overheard my dad on the phone he said someone was shot. Then he rushed out I think he went out for chun man did he say where? Fairy tower in pokfulam, I think will you come with me? You get there by yourself. I'll meet you right outside the village sure. Let's do that alright. Bye it's mom. She's angry with me that she got no driver now she has to take cabs young master, if you listen to your mother she won't be so upset right? I'll take a nap upstairs since I can't go out good, go and nap chi ho, where is it? Should be over there young master? Young master? Excuse me? Hi grandma, we're looking for someone called so chun man may I know if he is inside? The police were just here. They took everything grandma, how are you?

Sorry, I can't help you two people outside looking for so chun man - lai wah - dad I told you to mind your own business I'm only helping chun man's mother where is chun man? Come on in behind the screen how did it happen? Why didn't you get him to the hospital? Why didn't you get him to the hospital? I'm fine I told them not to do that but why? There's so much bleeding I don't want to get them in trouble do you know your mother and I are so worried about you? Chi ho and I have been looking for you everywhere, for a long time you only care about your so-called ideals did you care about the people around you? We've done so much just because we wanted to make life better for everyone do you really think that the world would become a better place with what you've done? Chun man? So chu man? Chun man? So chu man? Chun man? Chun man? Chun man? So chu man? Chun man? Lai wah, my heart aches too but for the sake of the nation and the greater cause of the masses fightings and sacrifices are unavoidable did you know what you're talking about? - Run! Run! - Run! Lai wah! Let's go! Kin fung, let's go! It's my fault that my son got killed please let me stay here with him let's run still want to run? Dad! Let's run - lai wah! - Young master, don't go back. They'll get you too I'm not leaving lai wah behind get me that pokfulam file yes, sir what were you doing in pokfulam? Passing by passing by? We saw you coming out of that house don't ever think that keeping your mouth shut could set you free. Sign here! You got the wrong person. She didn't do anything! Damn you, leftist! Get down! Why did you hit him? Why? Stop fighting back! Still won't talk? If you still won't talk, we'll beat you until you do. Stupid! You killed chun man! Stupid! Still won't talk! What's the yelling for? Li lai wah, under the current emergency regulations in Hong Kong at around four o'clock in the afternoon of August 23 you are charged for unlawful assembly in pokfulam and for assaulting the police you've seriously underminded Hong Kong's law and order do you understand? Charged? Aren't we due to stand trial? The court has to handle too many cases to control the situation, we have a special arrangement that's a trial in absentia? How could it be? Quiet! Shut up! Li lai wah, you can talk with your family before you enter a plea does it hurt? Lai wah, just sign and plead guilty and you can leave I've got everything settled I didn't do it. I can't plead guilty why are you being stubborn when things have come to this? Mom, what happened to dad and the others? They got three years, your father and chun man's father think about it. If you're also in jail what's your mom going to do all by herself? Mom, I'm sorry but I hope you could understand and respect my decision chi ho, thank you we're only distributing leaflets we didn't harm anyone if that's not alright is there still justice in the world? What about the brother and sister from yesterday? One was eight, the other was three both were killed by your bombs is there justice for them? Walk faster lai wah it's all my fault. I shouldn't have asked you to look for chun man lai wah, I got you into this li lai wah is innocent please let her go innocent? The mob hurled firebombs at lam bun he was burned alive they're innocent? Lai wah uncle wing kuen sze wai, sorry to trouble you when are you coming back to help on the farm? I'm afraid you don't want me well, farms won't discriminate ex-offenders well, you talk to me like that. You aren't afraid of hurting my delicate self? How could you be delicate if you could laugh about it? Right there's a letter can you please read for me? Sure oh, nothing much uncle wing kuen I got to help my mom with some deliveries talk to you later - mom - let me do it. You take a rest I'm fine if you hurt your back more trouble for mom and I don't worry when the new China-Hong Kong shopping mall opens in sha tau kok we'll be driven out of business shutters down for our store soon who needs more deliveries? Why didn't you tell me all this? You father is with the rural committee ask him yourself one pack of red Marlboro what's going on? I didn't want you to worry when you were in jail what about uncle wing kuen? Our great-grandfather also promised that we could live on the farm forever. Silly girl we'll be compensated. Silly girl shau tau kok is getting all the attention people are so envious of us only land owners like you are happy about it what about the tenant farmers? Just peanuts for them not even enough to get a toilet outside sha tau kok there's a story behind every person this is the world we're in did you see my wife? She went that way thanks ah, so sad in life the main thing is about letting go otherwise you're the one who suffers no one could talk you out of it how did you get in? Mom I won't be back for dinner.

Sorry it should be me saying sorry when we were being chased, I didn't pay attention to you. I didn't know you were left behind we all have our own destiny true but we are the masters of our destiny. Isn't that what we believe in? Do you think we still have a choice? My son is just an ordinary student, like many others but after this accident he couldn't go back to school and play sports with his schoolmates those who incited my son to join this social movement are still at large I really hope the police would get them sooner so they won't be able to fool our next generation today's special is uncle kuen's fresh local Greens with auntie ho's fresh grass carp I saw sze wai today how much longer do you want to punish yourself for? Isn't it great that you've me here washing and cooking for you? Uncle kuen. It's sze wai uncle kuen?

Yes turn it off turn the thing off did you hear that? This incident started when property developers wanted to build a China-Hong Kong shopping mall in shau tau kok many netizens are against the idea this shopping mall is located at the China-Hong Kong border mainland visitors can visit the mall without any visa the netizens think it's a ridiculous and compromising proposal to please the mainland they support the protests staged by the shau tau kok residents but some netizens also pointed out that this shopping mall could ease the current situation in sheung shiu and fanling which have been much affected by cross-border traders it could even alleviate other districts such as mong kok, tsim sha tsui and causeway bay where property prices have soared because of free independent travellers such netizens do not support the protests of the shau tau kok residents there're people gathering at the spot auntie, where are you going? Jat hon. I saw jat hon where was he? I get uncle to come with you? Ah, no I know where he is I get uncle to come with you? Ah, no. I know where he is where's my son? Hey, I want my son back auntie auntie if uncle wing kuen knew jat hon's whereabout he would have told us long ago. Right? He has no reason to hide jat hon, right? Auntie... auntie auntie, calm down first jat hon auntie auntie jat hon isn't there jat hon... Auntie jat hon... Whose clothese are these? These all belong to jat hon you still want to deny?

I miss you so much come out and see your mom ching, don't behave like this I really miss my son I miss him very much thanks, uncle wing kuen I don't think I can stay here any longer at first I thought it would only be for a short while before you wanted to go home who would have thought that you have stayed so long? Whether you have thought about it or not you should go back to your mother how much longer do you want to escape from reality? As a social movement leader, do you think you are responsible for those people who are jailed or injured? Do you think what happened was because you made the wrong decisions? But they can think for themselves, right? Your mom is so worried about you, don't you know? You wanted the social movement. You followed your own path no one would blame you but why would you pretend you're missing after falling into the sea? Is it because you're afraid of being jailed? I'm afraid of being jailed?

Chi chung when you're young, you hurled bombs and fought in the resistance movement the anti-colonial fight was for the sake of a better Hong Kong the young people now couldn't stand what's happening in Hong Kong they joined the resistance movement because there's no freedom and democracy now you think they're being manipulated during the riots at that time in Hong Kong we had no democracy but we still had freedom now? We don't even have freedom at the time of the handover, who would say we didn't have freedom? Then some people screwed up Hong Kong the mainland began to feel unease giving Hong Kong freedom if it's really for a better Hong Kong you should stop all this nonsense enough said all the best uncle wing kuen I've got some tools your kitchen roof is broken let me repair it for you repair?

If you really want to stay in Hong Kong I stay here with you but not that I don't know how you feel alright? Miss, stop it's not safe there uncle wing kuen things aren't as bad didn't we agree that we would resolve it together no matter what? Someone said to me once when you really love a place and really love the people there you'll spare no effort in protecting it I thought he was stupid at that time I finally got it today the kind of feeling he was talking about grandpa cheung jat hon according to court evidence you committed the following in 2018: Unlawful assembly inciting others to take part in unlawful assembly obstructing police officers in the execution of public duty police assault and resisting arrest on April 9 of this year you committed again unlawful assembly and criminal damage you are found guilty. The sentences will run concurrently you are given a two-year sentence with immediate effect civil disobedience save Hong Kong ourselves auntie ho sze wai you're leaving? We're leaving we ordinary people are happy with just a roof over our heads do you know where's uncle wing kuen? He said he would stay with his son for a while I remember one time I was sitting down on the street staring at the water safety barriers across the road suddenly I thought I was no different from them just that we're in different positions the human body is made up of energy and and matter it's formed before you were born it'll exist in another form even after your death according to the Buddha, all phenomena are empty neither beginning nor ending neither pure nor impure neither increasing nor decreasing when I was with uncle wing kuen for one year my mind was occupied with such silly thoughts as for me I helped uncle wing kuen rent a new farm I'm even working on the farm with him when I look back now I didn't know why I've wasted all this time my conclusion is very simple in one word what? Action you thought about it for one year and you only came up with just one word? Didn't you know this? Before the old monk studied zen 30 years ago, he saw mountains as mountains water as water after his enlightenment in zen, he saw mountains not as mountains water not as water after attaining the abode of rest, he saw mountains still as mountains water still as water hold like this in your hands no, the other way that's right, this hand on top that's right lift it up put it down that's right good. Now do it again so smart, kid where's yat long? Haven't seen him for a long while he's gone to America to study didn't he ask you to go with him? There's a price to pay for every choice uncle wing kuen do you know that someone has built a commemorative momument in shau tau kok - the truth of 1967 and its reconciliation? Did they really believe that the building of a momument could bring truth and reconciliation? People risked their lives for chairman mao but the mainland didn't care about them whether they lived or died well they tried their best and lived their lives with no regrets back in 1967 during the riots the mainland had no plan to take back Hong Kong zhou enlai said that the policy for Hong Kong was take a long-term view and make full use of Hong Kong who would have thought that a group of people wanted to make a mark in history through the cultural revolution? After all had happened the bristish colonial government finally got their acts together with the labour protection regulations and the independent commission against corruption compared to what we're doing now we seem to have achieved nothing that's not true at least I'm still alive and you've got me a new farm Hong Kong people from now on are still able to enjoy uncle wing kuen's fresh local Greens
