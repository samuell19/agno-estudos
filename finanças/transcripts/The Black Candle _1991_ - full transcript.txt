(dramatic music) (hooves thudding) (ax thudding) (whimsical music) - Aye, this wee pet, I could do with you right now. - Shut your filthy mouth. - All right, if you're that hot on her. My, oh my, see who she's with? - [Lily] You know darn well it's yours! - [Lionel] Shh! (Lily grunts) (hooves thudding) - Aye, you can have anybody if you've got the money, lucky bugger. Here, 50/50! - I'm taking it to Lily. - Are you mad? Her dad will belt her. - Not if I marry her. - Oh, Ma's gonna love this, wait till I tell her. (Fred grunts) - I've had enough of you, little brother. I know all about you were thieving and I've said nought, but if a whisper of this gets out, you won't know what else has kicked you. Take the cart home and tell Ma I've gone courtin'. (bell tolling) Hello, Lily. - [Lily] Hello, Joe. - I saw what happened. Here, take it. Lily, I have to ask you. Do you dislike me? - No. - Well, do you like me then? - Yes, I like you, all right? - Will you marry me? - You would just for that? - Oh, God in heaven, you think that man's hush money is what I'm after. - [Lily] Well, why? - It's you I want! I can't be as bad as the workhouse, can I? - You really would? - Yes. - I'll never forget this, Joe. (mellow music) I'll be true to you. - Hey you, come here! You'll not leave here like that! You don't walk outta here like that! - Hey, Would you like to say that to me, or is it just women you hate? - Hey, you, get back in this house! Lily, I'm warnin' ya! - Lily! Good luck, okay? (lively music) - Ma. I suppose Fred gave you me message. - Message? Rigamarole, that's all I get. - Lily's staying here till we get married. She won't mind sleeping on the berth there. Now, you make any trouble, and I'll go and rent a room and we'll live in sin. You'll just lose your wage packet that much sooner. - Joe! - Joe, oh, Joe. Oh, butter wouldn't melt! Getting wed when yesterday you weren't even courtin'? You soft lout, you've been had. - I'd sooner have the workhouse to this. - No, Lily, just-- - Joe, I wouldn't stay here if you paid me. - Oh, he'll be doing plenty of that. Don't tell me! I'm the first one to smell a rat! - Yeah, well do, Misses, being a close relation to one. (lively music) - Lily! Oh, Lily! Lily! (Joe laughing) - I see nought to laugh at! Why are you doing this? - I thought I told you. - Oh, I know what you said, but I can't take it in. Well, why? - I just love ya. I've always wanted you. When the ban comes it'll be as much mine as yours. Nobody will know any different. Nobody. (lively music) - [Driver] Take all the orders! (workers chattering loudly) (girl coughing) (workers chattering loudly) - He's got enough in there! One more in the next hour! Are ya ready. I see you're in the family way. This job's not for picking up a husband! (all laughing) (whimsical music) - [Man] Good morning, Miss. - Good morning. - Good morning, Miss Mordaunt. Nice to see ya. - Thank you, Joe. (workers chattering) (machines humming) (workers chattering loudly) - Mr. Joe has told me to tell ya that the Miss is coming. - Good morning, George. - Good morning, Miss. - George, won't you sit down? - No, no, Miss, I'm used to being on me pins. Don't worry about me. - George, you and I both know it's high time you retired. You'll be well looked after. - Aye, well, perhaps I will sit down. - So now, I need your advice on who could possibly replace you. - Miss Bridget, you're flattering us. We both know who's got the job. - You don't think he's right? - Joe is fine, it's his family wants lockin' up. But, you know, when you made him gaffer, he was resented. - Yes, George, because he makes them work. - (chuckles) He does that, aye. Or your dad would've made him manager, but your dad would've steered him. - You don't think I can manage people as well as my father. - Miss Bridget, you could've been your dad's son. (machines humming) (workers chattering loudly) - Well, Joe Skinner, what's your answer? - I don't know what to say, Miss. I didn't think old George would leave. Leave dropped down dead on the job. - He'll show you the ropes and then we can make changes. - We will, Miss. - [Bridget] What is it? - I was gonna call ya, ask ya, about a house. - A house? - I'm gettin' married. - Married? - To Lily Whitmore. - This is sudden, Joe. - I know, but at the same time, I've never felt less hesitation about anything in me life. I don't mean to take advantage, Miss. I'm grateful for the job, I thought. - Just do the job, Joe. You'll get your house. - I'm in your debt, Miss. (whimsical orchestral music) - [Peg] Oh, and your back. Will you take tea, Miss? - No, Peg, a cold beer. Is Victoria in? - Aye, she's up in her room. She had a visitor again. - Oh. - [Victoria] Oh, Bridget dear, you do look grubby. Let me get you a drink. - One's coming, I understand you've had company. Do I need two guesses as to who your visitor was? - No, Bridget dear, just one. Oh, I'm so happy, I could fly, and guess. - (chuckles) What? - We're invited to a ball. - What ball? - Oh, just a ball at Grove House. (Bridget laughs) Here, let me help you. - Oh, all right then. (Bridget laughs) You are going to the ball, not me. - Oh, don't be stuffy, darling, please, oh! (all laughing) - Shall I pour, Miss, or will you? - Oh no, Peg, thank you, I'll see to it. Here you are. - Thank you, I feel as old as the hills. - Nonsense, dear, you just look it in what you wear. You could look lovely if you dressed in fashion. - (chuckles) Yes, if I didn't have to breath or do any work. - Is something wrong? - No. - You're not cross? - No, so don't try to sweeten me up for the ball. - But Bridget, this one is different. Lionel wants us to get engaged. (mellow music) - Let's be serious. He's very handsome, but what does he do? All I'm saying is how well do you know him? What if you never saw him again? If he said he wanted to marry someone else? - [Man] Come on out now, don't drop it! Run, run, aye! Aye, each man on one! Each man on one! Come on, get moving there, hurry now! Come on, come on! (whimsical orchestral music) (dog panting heavily) (whimsical orchestral music) - Well, last up before the great leap, hey, Lionel, my boy? And you still don't know how soft your landing is going to be, do ya? - I can't very well go up to the other one and say, by the way, how much is Victoria actually worth, can I? - Well, I don't see why not. Comes to something when we have to be saved by a blacking factory, I can tell ya. - Well, if you hadn't sold every scrap of our land, we wouldn't be faced with this at all. - Or if I'd died off in time you mean. Lionel, you are the most unlucky bugger on God's earth, so don't mess up your chances this time. (door thudding) - Douglas! Douglas! Douglas, do you want people to think there's lunacy in the family. They'll be here any minute. - Don't panic, Father. - Panic, you'll get in there now and put on a show. This nonsense won't bring the money in. - I sold two pieces last week. - For cash? - Yes, and I spent it on tools and better stone. I've got three more orders. - I'll be buggered. The runt of the litter earning a living (laughs). - Well, we can't all marry heiresses, can we? (whimsical orchestral music) (guests applauding) - [Man] Ladies and gentlemen, the next dance is The Lancers! (whimsical orchestral music) - Are you enjoying yourself, Miss Bridget? - Yes, thank you. - You must be glad of a change from the air at polish works. - No, I enjoy that too. - I say, you're an absolutely treasure. - Responsibilities at last, aye, Lionel? - Mrs. Barnett. - Come and see me if you ever want the position. You know my sons, Bernard and Simon. (guests applauding) - Ladies and gentlemen, take your partners for the Wedding Bells Polka! - Excuse me. (lively orchestral music) - Dare I ask for the pleasure? - Sir, I regret I have need of my feet, but I would consider it a favor if you would sit with me. - [Douglas] Come on. (Bridget chuckles) (lively orchestral music) - I warn you. A woman who runs a business is considered a dead loss for civilized conversation. (lively orchestral music) - I was dreading tonight. The only thing I've enjoyed all evening has been your company. - You've made it most enjoyable for me too. - Even my dancing? - No, sir, do you expect me to lie. I can not believe you have only two feet. - What? What did you say? - I said I admired you for taking her on. (vase clatters) - [Douglas] Are you all right? - All right, the man's a maniac. All I said was that she wasn't the one with the cash! Nice party, attacked by the host! - [Man] Ladies and gentlemen, the next dance will be the Eightsome Reel! (lively orchestral music) - Didn't Lionel know? - [Douglas] I think everyone assumed that. - That Victoria was the heiress and I was the working cousin. - [Douglas] Yes. - What if Victoria has no money of her own? - I'm sure Lionel is very fond of Victoria, but these days ladies don't die of unrequited love. - What do you know about it? - Find Lionel, tell him to do nothing till tomorrow morning. I shall be here at half past nine prompt, and I shall want to see him and your father. (guest cheering) (light violin music) (whimsical orchestral music) - Mr. Bright, sir! - [Bridget] I am expected. - Oh, yes, Miss. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Come this way. - [William] Okay, boy. Bloody fine state of affairs. - This bloody fine state of affairs, sir, doubtless had a hand from you. I don't need a chair. What I have to say is better said standing up. - Then you'll excuse me if I sit down. - My cousin's only income is an allowance from me of 500 pounds a year. That being so, do you intend to keep your promise to Victoria and marry her. - Eh, my son is in no position to support a wife, and I'm in no position to support him. - Then what if she were to sue him for breach of promise? - Victoria, she's not the kind. - How do you know what kind of a woman she is? I have a proposition to make. I never imagined you earning a penny, and I knew that Victoria would only too happily share your poverty. - Poverty? - If money is all that stands in the way, I am willing to make your son an allowance. Upon marriage of 2,000 pounds a year, but there will be conditions. The first is that he finds employment within the first six months of his marriage. - God in heaven. - Lionel, we're talking business at last. Do go on. - The second is that he remain faithful to her, or I shall withdraw the whole amount, and persuade Victoria to return home. There it is. If you agree, be at my solicitor's at three o'clock on Monday. Victoria must never know, and I trust you'll do your utmost to keep her happy during her engagement. Good day to you. - (chuckles) Congratulations, Father. (William laughs) Now you can order some fresh cigars. (both chuckle) (whimsical orchestral music) (baby cooing) - [Joe] You all right? - He's such a lucky lad. What she want? Do you know? - Ah, she's always warpath. She's a bitter pill. What really gets her though is I don't have to swallow it anymore. Oh, hi. Well, that's the finest display of poverty I've seen in a long time. Is the tea in the pot or is it just water? - Yes, there's tea. Stewed all day. I'm reduce to this. - How is that then? None of your bets come up? Look, I've seen the show, so come on out with it. I've had a heavy day at the Mordaunt. I wanna get home. - Heavy day, tellin' me when a manager has a heavy day. - Oh, if I was a waster like your blue-eyed Fred, you'd love me, wouldn't ya? If I was Fred you wouldn't need to drag me down. - Oh, who'd bring your poor, old mother down? Not now your sweatin' on your precious bloody wife! Listen to me you! Our Fred hasn't brought a penny piece in for three weeks! You could give him a start! - Oh, you really let up with that, didn't ya? The kind welcome. How are ya, son, and how's your family? Well, you can go to hell! - Oh, sorry, sir. Did I overbalance ya? - Oh, you won't overbalance that big head. He won't even give his own kissin' kin the chance to earn a livin'. - You know why it's so hard to earn a livin'? Because you're bore an idol, and all he wants is easy money, and he's too thick to learn a way to do that! - Think I can't see easy money, Lily's ban. The father wouldn't want his famed wedding punched up, now would he? - You do that and I'll do for you! Do you hear? I'll finish you off! - Just try and stop me! - Leave him be, you, leave him be! - [Joe] Get off, Ma! (suspenseful music) - Hello, there. Are you lost? - No, no, sir, I know where I am. Good evening, sir. - Good evening. (suspenseful music) (men shouting) - [Man] Hey, hey, steady now, steady, steady! Steady, steady, hooah, hooah! - [Male] Hurry now, hurry! (hooves thudding) - Get out of the way, you stupid oaf! - [Fred] I'd like a word with you, mister, about Lily Whitmore. - What? - Lily's ban came a fortnight ago, and you've got a grand weddin' lined up, but not to her. You kept it sweet, didn't ya, eh? With a few lousy quid in a washed leather bag. - I heard she had married someone. - Aye, my brother, but he's not the kind to look after his family. Now me, I like to see justice done. - How much justice? - I reckon we could manage on 50 quid a month. - 50 quid a month. (foot thuds) (Fred grunts) (head thudding) (Fred gasping) (mellow music) (Lionel breathing heavily) (thunder rumbling) - Lionel, not riding? - He hit a gate back there in the field. - What, he threw you, the Admiral? - He sprang, he, he sprang a shoe. It was a bit loose. I can't blame him. - No, whoever else you blame, you never blame the horse. Good job there's a day or two before the wedding. - Yes, quite fortunate. (hooves thudding) (suspenseful music) - Lionel, Lionel, can you lend a hand? Out in the woods there's a fellow with his throat cut. He needs a doctor. - He's alive? - I'm sorry, you've had a fall. Get yourself a brandy, we'll manage. Looks too late for a doctor anyway. (mysterious music) (men chattering) (hooves thudding) (baby cooing) - You want more? - (chuckles) No thanks, lass, I'm full. - Come sit by the fire and I'll make some tea. You've been on your feet all day. - Lily. All the love words you could say wouldn't mean as much as what've you just said now. Nobody in me life's ever worried about me, even if me feet are freezin' and droppin' off. Hey. Hey. - I love you, Joe. (knocking on door) - [Policeman] Good evening, Mrs. Skinner. - [Lily] Hello. - [Policeman] Is Mr. Skinner in? - [Lily] Yes, he is. - May we have a word with him, please? Mr. Skinner! - Aye. - Your brother's dead. His body was found last night in Brooks Wood. - I'll have to go to me Ma's. - I don't think you better do that. We want you down the station. - Why, Joe, what for? - It's all right, lass. I'll be back. - You're factory manager at the Mordaunt Works, but you wouldn't give your brother a job. - Would you? - So why did you threaten to kill him? Your mother made a full statement after she identified the body. Ya had a fight! She had to drag you off! So you decided to finish the job later. - I what? - [Inspector] (chuckles) Isn't that what you said? I'll finish you later? - Me mother? (knocking on door) - [Policeman] Sir. - Yes. - [Inspector] This is the man that you saw yesterday in the woods? - [Douglas] Yes, that's him. - Well ah, thank you for coming in, Mr. Filmore. Well, what were you doing in the woods? - [Bridget] Thank you. - Five minutes, Miss. - What happened, Joe? - I wish I knew, Miss. God, I wish I knew. - Well, have you no idea? Did your brother have any enemies? - More than enough, but the one they all know about is me. - You'll need someone who can defend you. - It'll take a lot of defending, Miss. I threatened Fred that night. Me Ma's told them that and more. I was out there and I was mad enough and I was seen. Mr. Filmore identified us. - What were you doing out there, Joe? - I'm sorry, Miss. I didn't do it. But they're not looking for anybody else. I can tell ya that now. - Joe, you're my manager, and I'm gonna get you back to work if I have to knock their heads together myself. Do you hear? - Aye, Miss. Thanks. - I'll do everything in my power. (crowd cheering) (horn blowing) - Look after yourself, do you hear? - [Victoria] Mm hmm. - Lionel. (horn blowing) (crowd cheering) (mellow music) (crowd murmuring) - Put up the prisoner. (gavel pounding) Silence in court. Mr. Pearson, continue. - My Lord. I'll do for you. I'll finish you off. Were those your words, Mr. Skinner? - Yes, sir. - [Mr. Pearson] Speak up, please. - Yes, sir. - Your mother has testified that as you shouted those words you grabbed your brother by the throat. Do you admit that. - [Joe] It wasn't like that. - It was like that later though, wasn't it? - [Joe] No, sir. - Did you not pursue your brother, and murder him in an identical attack? - No. - No, because this time you used a knife. - My Lord. (crowd murmuring) - Silence, silence! - [Mr. Biel] My Lord, I really must-- - Mr. Biel, sit down. Mr. Pearson, you will rephrase. - My Lord. Mr. Skinner, you have been identified by Mr. Filmore as the man he saw in the woods near the time and place of your brother's death. Do you deny that? - No, sir. - Perhaps you can explain to the jury what your purpose was in being there. - No, sir. (crowd murmuring) - [Mr. Pearson] No further questions, My Lord. - Mr. Skinner, you were in the woods looking for your brother, were you not? - Yes, sir. - Did you find him? - No, sir. - And what did you do then? - I went home. (crowd murmuring) - Now, Mr. Skinner, your mother has told us at length how you refused your brother a job. Will you now tell us why in fact that was? - There was no vacancy. - Now, think back, Mr. Skinner. Had your brother ever held a job before? - Not for any length of time. - Was he in fact wholly unreliable, a known liar? Had you ever known him to lie? - Yes, sir. - Yes, was he also a thief? - At times. - Yes, at times, so was he not in fact someone all too likely to attract the fate which he did? (crowd jeering) - [Mr. Pearson] My Lord, I must object! (gavel pounding) - [Judge] Order! - Mr. Biel, I can not see how your line of defense is gonna help Joe. - Miss Mordaunt, my client has done nothing to help himself. - But asking him to vilify his brother, it makes it seem as though he has a motive. - Oh, well, perhaps you should defend the man yourself, and simply declare him innocent. Look, that judge has a dozen cases to try in as many days. Now, Mr. Skinner's own mother has as good as tightened the noose around his neck. I'm sorry, your concern for him does you great credit, but I must destroy the jury's sympathy for his brother. Now, I shall establish reasonable doubt. You can rely on it, believe me. - Will the foreman of the jury please rise. Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict upon which you're all agreed? - We have. - Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty of willful murder? - We find him guilty. - [Clerk Of Court] And so say you all? - [Jury Foreman] We do. - My Lord, the Queen's justices do strictly charge and command all persons to remain in silence as sentence is passed. - Person at the bar. This careful trial has now ended by the verdict which your fellows have pronounced. The sentence is that you be taken to the place from whence you came, and from thence to a place of execution. From there you'll be hanged by the neck until you be dead, and that your body be buried within the precincts of the prison. (dramatic music) - [Lily] Oh, my God (crying)! (melancholy music) - I told her not to worry. We all have to go sometime, aye? - [Bridget] What's got into you, Joe? You're giving up without a fight. At least tell me. - Just between us? - Yes. - No, Miss, you can't do everything, let it be. - And let them hang you? - They have to hang someone. If I told them why I went after me brother, believe me, it wouldn't save my neck. It would only do others a great deal of harm. - Others, you're protecting Lily. - I'm a common man, Miss, but what I feel for Lily is not a common thing. I married her to protect her, and I've been proud to be her husband, and father to her child. I'll not betray that now. - Oh, Joe. Joe Skinner, you're a fool. - I know, Miss. Love makes fools of all of us. What else is worth a candle? (Bridget crying) (melancholy music) - [Bridget] Have you thought what you'll do? - Yes, Miss, go back to the factory. - What about the baby? - Mary next door will take him in. - Lily, I'd like you to take up a position with me in my household. - Live in your house where he can drop in with your fine cousin? No, it would kill Joe twice. - He, what do you mean, Lily? - Nothing. - Don't tell me nothing. Look at me! - Joe was more a father than that man ever was. - That man? Lionel Filmore. - Yes. - [Bridget] And Joe knew? - Yes! - Oh, Lily. Did Fred know? - Nobody knew, Fred's the last person Joe would've told. - But if Fred found out somehow. - If Fred had found out and was going to tell, I believe Joe would've killed him. (knocking on door) - Come in. - [Servant] Mr. Douglas Filmore, ma'am. - Thank you. - [Douglas] Good afternoon. - Please. - Thank you. I'm ashamed I haven't called since. You don't blame me for the trial? - No. - Well, I confess I've come on an errand. I understand you've refuse to receive Lionel, is that true? - It is. - May I ask why? - You may not. - Bridget, you must know that Victoria has not settled at Grove House. She's the one who will suffer from this. - She's the one who married him. - But Bridget, you made that marriage. I know Lionel has his faults, but with your good influence. - My influence, my precious influence. I will not tolerate that man in this house and that's flat! Lionel is the father of Lily's child. Joe knew it. He kept it a secret for Lily's sake. Douglas, please, don't stay away. - Of course I won't. I'll call again even if it's only to tell you I've killed my brother. - You know that job you were looking for? - Yes. - Well, I need a supervisor in the shipping office. I could pay you 1,000 pounds a year to begin with. The boys won't like it. (both chuckle) And that's their own silly fault for keeping mommy in the dark, hmm. What do you say? (horse whinnying) (hooves thudding) - [Douglas] Lionel, I want a word with you. - Oh, you do, do you? I'll be in the dining room. - I don't think you'd want this spread about in there. You think you can get away with murder, don't you? Lily Whitmore's child, don't try to deny that you're father. - (laughs) You're a funny fellow, Doug. So, I have a bastard son. One that I know about, should I say. What do you intend to do about this vileness? - Bridget is going to look after Lily and the boy. - Huh, Auntie Bridget. - Now, you listen to me! Whatever's in the past, you're married now. You signed a condition for your 2,000 a year, and if Bridget won't enforce it, I will. - You pious, I have to earn that money everyday. You dare crawl out of the woodwork! - Douglas. - Hello, Bridget. - Didn't you see us? - I didn't wish to intrude. - Did you say anything to your brother? - Oh, I said something to him all right. - Well? - At first he seemed guilty, then he just laughed. I got so angry we almost came to blows. Don't look so surprised, Bridget. - Sorry, would you like me to show you the grounds? - Yes, I would. - [Bridget] Good. It's too big, of course. I think father only built it so that we girls could be introduced to gentile society. - You miss him still? - When he died I was adrift. Although, I did attract a number of suitors, mostly gentlemen well set in years who seemed to feel my estate more than compensated for my other drawbacks. What is it? Is something in my hair? - No, Bridget, I would tell you you had beautiful hair, if you didn't dismiss anything that sounds like a compliment. - Not at all. I know I have beautiful hair. It's my latest project. It's nearly finished. Was a mitten in here, this way. - Good morning, and once it's ready? - Once it's ready, it's for Lily. I hope she'll be really cozy here. - [Douglas] Yes, I'm sure she will be. - Good evening. - Hasn't been for me. - Stupid girl, belly full and afraid to talk about it. I mean all I asked was how he got there. Silly bitches, women. Where are you going? Haven't clapped eyes on you for days. - I've got some work to finish. - Oh, yeah, I've got two sons working now. A bloody lot of good they do me. Lionel's off on business with blousy old Daisy Barnett. Do you remember her? Just a touch over 40. Seen off two husbands already. (snickers) There's not much shipping in Carlisle, but there are a few hotels I can tell you, mm. And as for that stupid goose, Victoria, I mean it's Lionel this or Lionel (grunts), ooh. Give me a hand, will you, thank you. I'm tired of life, Doug. Wake up every morning and I hate the bloody light. It's all right, I can manage the stairs. If I fall down, I hope it's near the bottom, so I don't have to make all that effort in clambering up to the top. Oh, I don't need you. (Jimmy whistling) (Admiral whinnying) - What's wrong with Admiral? - Oh, he needs exercise, but Mr. Lionel doesn't like anyone else riding him when he's away. - Perhaps in case he springs another shoe. - Oh, the Admiral would never spring a shoe, sir. He's got a kind of hard hoof, you know. Good feet, sir. - [Douglas] Lionel, not riding? - [Lionel] No, he ah, sprang, he sprang a shoe. It was a bit loose. I can't blame him. - [Douglas] Can you lend a hand. Out in the woods is a fellow with his throat cut. He needs a doctor. - He's alive. (mysterious music) (hooves thudding) - [Driver] Steady, whoa! Steady! (dog barking) Whoa! - Ah, did you enjoy your trip to Carlisle, Mr. Lionel? - Yes, thank you, Bright, most productive. - Shall I arrange for supper, sir? - No, have the bags taken up. I'll be in the library. (mallet thudding) - [Jimmy] Mr. Douglas. - Jimmy. - What you doing there? - This stone is perfect for something I'm making. - Aye, but Mr. Lionel had us repair that wall just before the weddin'. He'll murder us if he sees what you're doin'. - Mr. Lionel? - [Jimmy] Aye. - Jimmy, I intend to take full responsibility for this. I promise you. - Aye, but-- - Jimmy, it's all right! Go back to bed. (mallet thudding) (dramatic music) - Give me that knife. (hand thuds) (Douglas grunts) (glass crashing) (fists thudding) (both grunting) (door thudding) - Hey, come here. Out! Bright, you go and sort this out. Tell them if one word of this gets out, they'll go out with it! What's got into you two? He murdered Joe Skinner's brother! - [William] Lionel, it's not true. - He was blackmailing me, him and his brother! I live with 2,000 a year, remember! Don't make a mess of your chances this time! That's what you said! - I should've saved my breath for the police! - Douglas, lad, what will you do, ruin your own family? The harm's done, it's finished! And if you go through with this, you'll finish me too. - I'm going to leave this house, but before I do I want a letter written by him renouncing every penny from Bridget, then it's finished. - Lionel! Douglas, what's the matter? - Douglas has just persuaded me to stop being paid for being your husband. Do you need me to explain, my dear? I was bribed to marry you by Miss Bridget. Not because you're poor, but because you're a useless, empty headed, stupid, little bitch that she wanted off her hands! (melancholy music) - I can do it on my own. I can do everything on my own. That was always going to be my lesson, wasn't it? - What's the matter? You seem ill. - Are you surprised? - Yes, I-- - Don't bother lying. All you want to know is why the money you paid to get rid of me is being refused. - To get rid of you? Lionel said that? - Oh, yes, dear, most eloquently. - And you believed him? - Bridget, you see me as a silly girl. Well, the silly girl would refuse the trifling allowance you still give her. But I'm afraid this silly girl has caught her death. What's left of me knows I'm going to need the money. If I could tear my stomach open at this moment and rip this thing out, I would. (sighs) I can't tell you what happened, because it had nothing to do with me. There was a fight, and Lionel and Douglas decided it all between themselves. They follow your example in that respect. - Surely Douglas would tell you. - I can't ask him because he's left the house. Seems they might've killed each other if he hadn't. - Where's he gone? - I don't know, and I don't intend to worry my pretty little head about it. (melancholy music) (whimsical orchestral music) - Stop, steady. (mallet thudding) - Good day. - [Bridget] Good day, hello, Douglas. - Bridget, how on earth did you find me? - I have my sources. - Um, my master mason, Sam. Sam, Miss Bridget Mordaunt. - Ma'am. - [Bridget] How do you do? - I'll take me break now, sir. Stretch me legs a bit. - Yes, do that. - Douglas, you're not living here? - Madam, I'll have you know my trade is very comfortable. - Be quiet, why didn't you let me know? - Let you know what, that I'd left home, and would you kindly do something about it as you do for everybody else? I'm sorry. - So you should be. Making me sound like some do-gooder, maiden aunt. What caused the trouble at the house? It must've been quite drastic to have got Lionel to part with his allowance. - It was drastic. I earn my living now, and I sleep peacefully in my bed at night. - You rent this? They should pay you. - Not this farmer. As Sam says, he'd skin a louse for its hide. - I'm not quite in that category myself, but I do have a building to let. - [Douglas] You do? - The one I showed you. - Bridget, you were going to put Lily in there. - Yes, but Lily prefers the lodge. Anyway, after the money I've spent, and I want to see a return, so I'm letting it. - What are you asking, by the way, as rent? - I really couldn't tell you. My agent is dealing with that in New Castle. You could pay me a visit or, or come to lunch one Sunday. - Now on that you have a bargain. (whimsical orchestral music) - I've never needed a Christmas so much. - It would be happier for me if we were married. - What can I do? She point blank refuses a divorce. - You told her I'll make a settlement. - Yes, but don't expect sense from that silly, little bitch. - I'm going gray, my dear. It had better be soon. - Daisy. (knocking on door) - Come in. - Mr. Bernard and Mr. Simon are here, ma'am. - Ask them to wait in the study. I will receive them there. - Yes, ma'am. - What the hell are they doing here? - They have arrived for Christmas. - For Christmas, but I thought that I-- - Oh, Lionel, I did so want to be with you, but I can't turn my sons away. If we were married. - Oh, I see, goodbye to Lionel, back to hell. - Lionel, don't. Please. - I'll wait around. See if I don't. (mellow music) - Oh, Victoria, my dear, come in, sit down. Well, how nice of you to come and sit with me. By God, we have come to something, Victoria. Married into a blacking factory we didn't even get. And now you have a beautiful daughter, but the father's run off, and we can't even afford you a wet nurse. But I envy that child. (guest laughing and chattering) ♪ Well, we wish you a happy, a happy New Year ♪ ♪ I wish you a happy New Year ♪ ♪ Oh, I wish your household well ♪ ♪ Oh, I wish you good health ♪ ♪ That is more than what he felt ♪ (Bridget laughing) (lively music) - It'll warm up in a minute. - Douglas I don't know what happened to bring you here, but I'm glad it did. - I know you, Bridget. You think if I won't tell you directly why I left Grove House, perhaps you can coax it out of me another way. - Preposterous. - Listen. (bells ringing) Happy New Year, Bridget. (mellow music) I will tell you something. I planned to kiss you tonight. - And so that's the return on my investment, because this building was never for rent when I told you it was. - Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! What's this? What's happening? - She had a heart attack on New Year's Eve. She died almost instantly. - Oh, my God, I don't believe it. - No, I don't suppose you do. Anyway, we've packed your things. - Sent them back today. - You bastards, you killed her. - Now, see here! - Simon, he's not worth it. Me mother's share in the business was hers only while she lived. You would never have got it. Even if you could've married. She had a heart complain for years, but I don't think she told you about that either. - Well matched I would say. - You killed her all right. (melancholy music) (Lionel crying) - Oh, it seems you lost your job, my boy. - I take it my things have arrived then. - Yes, I had them sent up to your room. - Supposing I went away, took a ship to America? Could you raise the money? - (chuckles) What do you bloody think? - How much do you think we'd get if we sell up? - Sell up, not while I'm alive. - Oh, no, no, not while you're alive, no. (dramatic orchestral music) (pounding on door) - Did you want to see me, dear? - No. - Oh, I thought you might want to increase your offer for a divorce. Or have we had another failure? - I loved her. I loved her! (Victoria grunts) - My God, then I'm glad you know how it feels. - Yeah. - No? Well, I think you should know that Bridget and Douglas are to be married. It's happy news, isn't it? Bold, charming Lionel tied to a silly bitch without a penny, and the runt of the litter gets the rich one. (hand thudding) (Victoria grunting) - Get up! (Victoria grunting) (Lionel grunts) (Victoria screams) (glass crashing) - No (gasping)! (hand thuds) (Victoria grunts) (Lionel spits) (Victoria crying) (melancholy music) Excuse me, Father. I just wanted you to know I'll live. - Oh, Victoria. (knocking on door) - Can I, can I be of help, sir? - Oh, Bright, open the drawer there, please. The case, can you bring it? Thank you, and now will you get me a glass of brandy from the next room? Oh, you know where I've been hiding it, go on. Thank you, is the couch made up in that room? - [Bright] I'll see to it, sir. - Have someone look after the baby for tonight. Could you see to that first, please. - [Bright] Yes, sir. - For you, my dear, for you. (dramatic music) (William groans) (William gasping) (gun firing) - [Lionel] (gasps) I'll be damned. (gun firing) (Lionel grunts) (light violin music) (dramatic orchestral music) (baby crying) (melancholy music) (dramatic orchestral music)
