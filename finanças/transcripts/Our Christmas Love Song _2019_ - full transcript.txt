RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM When is auntie Melody coming on? Soon, sweetie, soon. I believe it's called patience, Lulu. I don't think your granddaughter was born with that particular trait. Nope. I can't believe I still get nervous before live TV. Don't be silly. You're Melody Jones, you got this. Hey Chase. Are you excited to see Melody on the Opry tonight? You want me to change it? It's almost time. Yeah, switch it to football. You sure? Football, got it. What a perfect way to launch your new Christmas single. I hope they like it. Like it, they are gonna love it. You're my manager, you have to say that. What was it that your mentor used to tell you? Connie? Connie Black, queen of country. "A new song is..." "Just a hit song no one's heard yet." That's right. Oh, that's classic Connie. I hope she's watching tonight. It's about to start, Connie. And now, ladies and gentlemen, miss Melody Jones. - Here we go. - Here we go. Okay, yeah, you can change it. Good evening everyone. It's always such an honor to play country's most famous stage. And tonight I'm gonna share with you a song that's pretty special to me. A Christmas song. See, some of us don't make it back home for the holidays as often as we'd like to. Madison, Indiana, woohoo! So does this mean auntie Melody is coming home for Christmas this year? I don't know honey, you know how busy she is. So I wrote a song called "Heart Of Christmas", and you get a special preview of it tonight. It'll be released everywhere tomorrow. I hope you enjoy it. ♪ In the cardboard box with the ornaments and wreaths ♪ ♪ in the crisp winter air on caroling night ♪ ♪ in the little smiling faces rolling in the snow ♪ ♪ you'll find the Heart Of Christmas ♪ Nice song.

Get back to work. Fun. I was so relieved last night went well, I couldn't have asked for a better launch for the new single. Apparently it's taking off on the streaming services and I heard it on the radio on the drive in. Melody... I don't know what took me so long to record that one, you know? Maybe it's just too close to home. Mel, not yet. After the show, I got a call from Connie Black. Connie Black, she heard the song? She heard it all right. I'm so glad she heard it. Why wouldn't she have just texted me, though? We spent so many years together on tour. I was going to say, I got a call from Connie Black's people. Her people? What, you mean Burt, Burt Hooper? You know Connie's manager? Of course I know Burt. As long as I've known Connie. Burt called me because they think "Heart Of Christmas" is a little too close to Connie's song "Heart Of Tennessee." Some words, a few chords. Wait, she thinks... I did not steal that song. Can you prove it? Well I don't have the sheet music on me, if that's what you mean, but I wrote that song a long time ago. Long before "Heart Of Tennessee" ever came out. Oh, Melody... That's my song. Your song or not, Connie wants to have a sit down with the two of us and Burt, right away, to discuss options. Options? No, I wrote "Heart Of Christmas", actually with my dad. Well then you must have the music written down somewhere. I have the chord charts from the recording session a couple of months ago, but I just jotted it down, it's been in my head for years. But the original version, I mean. The ones that pre-date "Heart Of Tennessee." It was so long ago, I don't know. Maybe back home somewhere? So as you can hear, similarities are striking. The chords are very common. Lots of songs have references to home. Maybe so. When we spoke earlier, Piper, you mentioned an old copy? Yes, Melody wrote the song when she was in high school. Yeah. So where is it? I'm not sure. Everybody is talking about this song. It's all over the radio and the Internet like nobody's business. Ever since that Opry show. This is set to be a massive hit. And we think it sounds a lot like "Heart Of Tennessee." This is my song. A song you have no proof of actually having written. You and Connie used to sing "Heart Of Tennessee" on the road together all the time. For all we know, you got the idea for "Heart Of Christmas" from that. Connie, why are you doing this? You know I would never steal from you. When I first came to Nashville, I was 20 years old with nothing but a guitar and a dream. You gave me my first break. My first performance at Connie's cafe. I would never forget that. You were my mentor. You are my mentor. I'd never betray you. This song came from my Heart, it's a part of me. I'm not gonna lie and say that I stole it. All right, I'm feeling generous. It's the holiday season. I'll give you to Christmas day to decide whether you want to settle, or provide proof that you wrote this song and didn't steal it. Gives you 12 days. We just want what's fair. Come on Connie, let's go. Connie. Do you really wanna do this? I think it's pretty clear what's going on here. Connie's career has been in a rut for a few years now, and wants to ride on your coattails. I don't know, I think Connie really believes this. I'll talk to the lawyers. In the meantime, I think you should lay low. Avoid the spotlight. You have a few appearances booked around the holidays. I'll reschedule, citing personal reasons. I think I need to go home. Okay, I'll call for a car. No, I mean home home. Madison, Indiana. Are you sure? I know how difficult it is for you being back there during this time of year. Yeah, I haven't been home for the holidays since my dad passed away. But I'm sure there's a copy of that song somewhere at my mom's house. If I'm gonna deal with this, that's where I have to be. I need to go home for Christmas. Welcome to Madison Candy, we'll be right with you. Take your time, no rush. You're back for Christmas. And you're staying with your sister, no arguments. Okay! Okay. Hey mom. Mel. Oh baby, it's good that you're home. I finally made it back. Two years without a family Christmas really feels like forever. You've been so busy. It'll be great not to be touring around the holidays, right? It sure will. Good. To be continued. That's mom for you, ever the consummate professional. I think that's where you got it from. Maybe. I am so glad to be back. Just so you know, I might have to head back to Nashville for a really quick trip. But I will be home for Christmas. Something came up. I'll tell you about it later. Okay. Red licorice. Oh, Lucy. You should go pick her up from school. She would love that. I'll be there, what time? - 3:30. - Okay. Does she know I'm in town? I haven't told her yet. This is gonna be fun. And on your way back, can you stop off at the market and pick up flour, butter, eggs, and sugar? Yes. Let me guess, Christmas break cookies? Jones family tradition? You remembered. I never forget a cookie. Let it be known. Auntie Mel! Hey! Hey kiddo. Guess what? You're staying for Christmas? How did you know? Because I made so many wishes, I knew it had to come true eventually. Oh, sweetheart. Let's go. There's so much we can do. Go to the tree lighting at the old Meadow, then there's the Christmas Craft and Bake Sale. - Okay. - Okay. And Santa's Wonderland! That's a total must see. Then we must see it. But I wish they still did the Madison Christmas concert. That was so much fun. Hey, Lucy. Your mom told me your dad has to stay stationed overseas this Christmas, I'm sorry. It's okay. I know he's keeping us all safe. He sure is. But you know what makes me feel better, auntie Mel? What's that? Your song, "Heart of Christmas." You should play it all the time. I hope I can. Let's go. I'll grab some eggnog. Gotta have eggnog. Well yeah, I'll grab the cookie ingredients. Sounds like a plan. I think that's Melody Jones. I heard she was home for Christmas. Yeah, apparently so. Do you think Chase knows? Apparently not. Merry Christmas. Melody? - Hey. - Hey. Chase. Yeah. What a surprise. Yeah, it's a surprise seeing you in a grocery store. Yeah. Just kind of a Madison thing, grocery shopping. Yeah. We do a lot of grocery shopping here. Yeah. Taking an eggnog bath? Yes. - Yeah? - I am. And the rest will be for the tavern. Mattson's tavern. - Yep, yep. - All those holiday drinks. It's that time of year. You're still running the place? I am, yes. And what about you, how long are you in town? I'm staying for Christmas. Great. I mean great, it's great that you're gonna be here for the holidays. Yeah, you said that. I'm also gonna do a little work while I'm here. Country star stuff? Just looking for something. Something from a long time ago. Mr. Walker said they were all sold out. Chase, you took them all? Yeah, I did. Okay, fine, yeah. You may have this one, I can spare that one. - Thanks. - Yeah. Well, it was good seeing you, Mel. Yeah, great to see you too. I'll see you around. Yep. Bye. You know, Melody, have you been by the tavern lately? We did some renovations. No, I haven't. Yeah, it's pretty cool. I think he's inviting you to go see it. Yeah, it's an open invitation, come by any time. - Thank you. - So yeah. Okay, yeah, good to see you. You're not invited. What? Mom told me you both had history. Ancient history. Like the Jurassic period? Something like that. Come on, let's go get some cookie ingredients. Enjoy. Eggnog run looks like a success. Good idea, huh? Your baby sister's on the ball today. All week, actually. Been off your game lately. Yeah. You all right? Yep, yep, yep, yep. Come on, Chase. It's Madison, word travels faster than the Internet. I know you saw Melody. Okay fine, I saw Melody. So what's the big deal? Usually you manage to avoid each other pretty well. Like exes often do. Yeah, this was different. Don't tell me you spoke. Chase Norman Mattson. Don't tell me you spoke actual words to each other and had a conversation. Okay, all right, all right yes. Yes, okay, we spoke. And? What? It was awkward. But then at the end it was less awkward. I think. I think you should ask her to the tree lighting tomorrow night. That's not gonna happen, no. Hey mom, look at this! What's up? - Great. - Thanks. Hey! This is so good. I know, right? Do we really have to save these for the Christmas Bake Sale? We should save at least one or two. Seriously though, I have missed the Craft and Bake Sale, it's one of my favorite Madison Christmas traditions. Okay, but back to this whole "Heart Of Christmas" thing. Sorry, cookie distraction. You wrote that song back in high school. I know, that's what's so crazy about it. And dad helped you with it. Yeah. Well I'm sure the music is somewhere at the house. You know mom keeps everything. She sure does. Okay, honesty time. You and Grant McKinley. Details. We... We... - You're getting married. - We broke up. That is not what I thought you were gonna say. Sorry Jill. Well, three years is a long time for a Nashville power couple. And hey, he's a great guy, we sing well together. But? We just didn't have that, you know, that chemistry. Fire. And now that we've finally admitted it, we can be really good friends. Well, it's better to tell the truth than to live a lie. You did the right thing. Thank you. You know, I've been so busy, I hadn't really had a serious relationship since... Since Chase? When you were still living here in Madison. Yeah. Long time ago. Now that was fire. And we put it out. Sometimes a fire is never truly gone. Give him a call, I don't think he's seeing anyone. You should ask him to the Christmas tree lighting tomorrow. I don't know. He did invite me to go by the tavern, though. Are you going? I thought I might drop by tomorrow before I visit mom. Ask him to the tree lightning, then. - Hey Mel! - Hey. Aww, it's been way too long. Come on in. - Hey. - Hi. Mel. Have you met my brother Chase? I think we ran into each other at the store? - The store. - Yeah. This looks really nice, I love what you've done with this place. - Thanks. - Yeah, thanks. It was a pretty serious renovation, but it needed it. So Christmasy as well. It could use a few more trees. I knew you were gonna say that. No you didn't. - Ask her. - No. - Now's a good time. - Not now. She broke up with Grant McKinley. What? Jillian told me. - I'm not gonna ask her. - You have to ask her. Ask me what? So, quick question. Golden angel or snow globe for the bar top? Both? Yep, I told you. - Yeah, both. - Yep, both. Mom? There you are. Hey, I got you a squished poinsettia. It's perfect. I'm just working on some crafts, come help me. Well the reason I'm here is... Christmas treat jars, remember? I do. I'm putting you on antler duty. Are you sure? I don't know. I missed you around the holidays, Mel. I know, I'm sorry I haven't... No, don't apologize, I understand. Christmas is a busy time for performers. So are all of these for the Craft and Bake Sale? Most of them. Your father and I used to make these together. Yeah, I remember. Isn't it hard? Doesn't it make you think of him? Everything makes me think of him. You just have to work through it, right? A few of these reindeer jars are especially for Lucy. She's just crazy about them. Melody? Yes? I was just saying, Lucy's crazy about reindeer. As I recall, so was someone else. Still am. So I have to look through my room and try and find some old sheet music. Jillian told me what you're going through, honey, I'm so sorry. Thanks, mom. I just hope I find it, it would go a long way in proving my case. But first, I have a couple of reindeer to finish. What do you think? That one's for Lucy. I'll fix it. Yes. Please be here, please be here, please be here. Where could it be? - Any luck? - No. Aww, I'm sorry honey, you'll find it somewhere. I have faith. Thanks mom. A lot of memories up there? Oh yes. I heard you visited Chase at the tavern. Yeah. Well, maybe you should invite him to the tree lighting tonight. Why does everyone keep telling me that? - About the song. - Yeah? I had an idea, you should talk to Mr. Tyler at the music store. He asked your father and I, this was a long time ago of course, he asked if he could borrow some of your old songs as teaching material. I think you were on tour at the time, so we couldn't get in touch with you. Did he actually take some of them? Well I'm sure he did. We didn't think you'd mind, of course, because he was your favorite music teacher, your dad's oldest friend. Oh no, I don't mind at all, that's fine. And the kids were so excited to be learning from you. Listen, Lucy's finishing her guitar lesson at the store right now. Why don't you pick her up and you can talk to Mr. Tyler about it? And then you can bring her on to the Candy store. Sure. That sounds like a plan, I'll do it. What do you think? Looks like Christmas. Well that's what I was going for. Melody Jones, as I live and breathe. Hey Mr. Tyler. How's my best student? I don't know if I'd say that. Well I would. Two top 10 hits and that gold record. Well, that was a few years ago now. Your dad was so proud. You still keep it framed in the house? In the study. What was that he used to say? "It isn't about the gold record on the wall..." "It's what's behind the gold record that touches us all". That's right. I'd say the only thing missing from your illustrious career is a duet with Hunter Hamilton. I'm still waiting. Yeah, so am I. Well anyway, I hope that you can stick around for some of the Christmas festivities. But I know you're busy. Actually, Mr. Tyler, I was hoping you might be able to help me with something. Mom mentioned that you're using some of my earlier songs as teaching material, the original ones. I do. Do you happen to have the sheet music for "Heart Of Christmas?" No, I don't have that one. I wish I did. You played it beautifully on the Opry. Thank you, Mr. Tyler. What took you so long to record it? I'm not sure. I think I just wanted to keep that one for myself, you know? For me and dad. And I figured it was high time I recorded a Christmas song finally. I'm so glad I did. Except for... Except for what? You're pretty sure you don't have that music sheet? I'm sure. I know it's been years. No, I believe you. They're under lock and key, don't worry. If you want them back. No, that's fine. Thank you. The students just love 'em. Well that's lovely, is that? She's got a natural talent. Reminds me of somebody else at her age. I think I'm gonna go surprise her. No, keep going, it sounds good. That is so beautiful. So glad you liked it. I'm here to pick you up. Great! Do you mind if I look at the guitars for a few minutes? Go ahead. - Well, bye. - Bye! Good job. Hi. Hello. So you work here too. I do, I give the occasional lesson. And the Santa hat, is that part of your everyday wardrobe, or just holiday thing? Yeah, that was... You don't have to explain it. - Okay. - It works. Okay. Well, I'm happy that you're keeping your hand in music. Yes. Yep. Except your b string's a little out of tune. It is a little, yeah. Do you want to go to the tree lighting? I wasn't sure you were going. I wasn't sure if you were... I mean, if you're going anyway. Yeah, we should go together. Yeah. I mean, not together together, but. Right, but you know, just so we don't have to... Find each other. Exactly. So seven? At the cocoa stand. Yes, definitely. - Okay. - Okay. That's better. Yeah. That's a lot better. I'm just getting ready to leave for the Madison tree lighting, it's a tradition here. That's great. Did you find what you were looking for? I'm not sure. The song. Proof that you wrote it in high school. Oh, that. No, not yet. Well, tick-tock, I thought that was the main reason you went back there. It was. But you know, I haven't been home for Christmas in two years. I'm really enjoying myself. I wish I could make time for Christmas, I just get so busy. Hey, guess what. If you really love something, you can always make time for it. I'm learning that. And right now, I'm about to be late for a tree lighting. - One more thing. - Gotta go. Hello? Hello? It's great to see you too. That's for you. Thanks, Chel-vis. Hey, oh no, that stops right now. Hey you two. - Hi. - Hi. Can I ask her? Yeah, go ahead. After the tree lighting, do you wanna go to Santa's Wonderland with me? I will also be there. Okay, I would love to, of course. Yes! See you two in a bit. Bye. I wish dad was here. I know. So do I. You okay? My dad and I always used to come to the tree lighting ceremony together. This was kind of our thing. Do you wanna do something else? No, no, I wanna stay. Sometimes you just have to face the music, right? A very wise man once told me that. He sounds very wise. He was. Still is, probably. Well, they're starting soon. Shall we? Yes, yes we shall. Very well. I don't think I ever told you I actually pushed the button one year. Ages ago, I was like six or seven. I was so nervous to get up there and light the lights in front of all these people. Your first cage of stage fright. Yeah, you bet. But then dad got up there with me and he put his arm around me and he told me I had nothing to be nervous about. Because all of these people carried Christmas in their hearts, and I should think of the audience as one big family, because that's really what they are. And I still think of that to this very day, any time I have stage fright. Please join me down here, please. Good evening, folks. Gather around, gather around. As your mayor, I'm very pleased to kick off Madison's Christmas festivities with our annual tree lighting ceremony. Now, we like to call ourselves America's home for Christmas for a reason. And of course, the home of the fabulous miss Melody Jones. Think that's you. Now, I heard a rumor that she's here in the crowd with us tonight. Melody, where are you? Hey. There she is. There she is. Would you please do us the honor by pressing the button tonight and lighting the tree? Yeah. Get up there. Come on, what do you say? Okay, okay. Here she comes, folks. Madison's shining star. Please, say a few words. This is such an honor. Thank you. I haven't been home for Christmas in a couple of years, and I've really missed this. Now what do you say we let the tree do the talking? But I could really use a little help. Lucy. Come on up. Everything's better in twos. Okay folks, you ready? Three, two, one! Come on! That was fun pressing the button with Lucy. Yeah, you shoulda seen her face, she was so excited. I forgot what it was like to make time for... Make time for Christmas? Yes. And other things. Well surely you remember Santa's Wonderland. How could I not? All the time we spent here. Memories. So is Christmas the only reason you came back to Madison? No. There is another reason. Okay. You remember my song that I played on the Opry the other night, "Heart Of Christmas?" I always loved that song and I knew it was gonna be a hit the first time I heard it. Anyway. Connie Black is claiming that I stole that song from her. She says I plagiarized her song "Heart Of Tennessee". That's impossible. You wrote that song 10 years before her song. Exactly. And I wrote it with my dad. He taught me everything I know about country music. And that was our first collaboration. I remember the first time we played that song live at the Madison Christmas concert when we were... Yeah. When we were. - Anyway. - Yeah. I need to find proof. Right. Or else? Or else she's gonna file a lawsuit and take me to court. Really. Yeah, and I don't want a lawsuit, I don't want a scandal. If I settle, I'll be admitting I stole the song. Hey, do you ever think about what might've happened if you had come to Nashville with me all those years ago? I know I'm not the only one who had a dream. No, never thought about it once. I don't believe you. Yeah, sometimes. But I had responsibilities here. After my dad passed, I had to take over the tavern, or else we would've lost it. Dot, she was just a kid. I remember what a tough decision that was for you. Yeah. Dot pretty much runs that place now, she loves that tavern. Like you do. Yeah, it'll always have a special place in my Heart. But I feel like lately I've been in a bit of a rut. You know Mel, I'm sorry that we lost touch. Me too. And I don't want it to happen again, and I don't want to avoid seeing each other like we've been doing all these years. Getting too old to play games. I agree. But maybe it's more than playing games. There's a lyric in an old song, it's one of Connie Black's, actually. "It's easy to love, but it's easier not to". Maybe we avoid the people that we once were close to because... Because it's easier. Easier than dealing with the feelings. Yeah, and the memories. Of what you once had. Mel, I... Come on, the nutcracker display is starting! I think we've been summoned. Yes, the nutcracker display, we can't miss that. It wouldn't be a Madison Christmas without it. Very well. ♪ Makes the nations prove ♪ the glories of ♪ his righteousness ♪ and wonders of his love ♪ and wonders of his love ♪ and wonders, wonders of his love ♪ So much joy in that song. Thank you. I'm reminded how much I love this season. Music can play such an important and inspirational role in our lives. It brings people together. Especially at Christmas, which is a time for family, friends, and love. But it's also a time for other things. Christmas is about forgiveness, and what it means to come home. Jill, you didn't ell me you started singing. Chase, did you know about this? I plead the fifth. Everyone knew but me. What about you, mom? I always knew she loved singing. She used to borrow your hairbrush and use it as a microphone. What? When I was a kid, just want to clarify that. 25 is not a kid. Well look, hairbrush or not, I knew I could never be as talented as you, Mel. But when I saw you sing, you always looked so happy. And I need a lift after Bill went overseas about a year ago, so I joined the church choir, and it makes me very happy. Well I think that Lucy has the makings of a professional singer. Oh yeah? Why's that? Well, 'cause she's already late for her own gig! Almost ready! Lucy! - There she is! - Yay. Thank you. My name is Lucy, and I'd like to perform a song for you all this afternoon. It's about love and the meaning of Christmas. It was written by my aunt, Melody Jones. Maybe you've heard of her. And I was told that my grandfather helped write it too. That's right, sweetie. It's called "the Heart Of Christmas". I hope you all enjoy it. ♪ In a cardboard box with ornaments and lights ♪ ♪ in the crisp winter air when caroling at night ♪ ♪ and the little smiling faces rolling in the snow ♪ ♪ you'll find the Heart Of Christmas ♪ ♪ you'll always find the Heart Of Christmas at home ♪ That was wonderful, sweetheart. Thanks! That was so beautiful. Thank you. That was great. You must have an amazing guitar teacher. Here. And now she's got a roadie. Okay, I have absolutely got to find the original version of that. That song belongs to all of us. You're gonna find it honey, I know it. Just being here with all of you, with the decorations and the tree, and all of it. I really wish dad... He's here too, Mel. I know I haven't been home the last couple of Christmases, and part of the reason why is because I've been touring and I've been so busy. Honey, you enjoy it so much. But the other part of the reason is because I didn't know what it was gonna feel like without dad around. And I had no idea how to handle it, or how to talk about it. And I know that probably sounds very selfish, and I am so sorry. We know you're doing the best you can. You're just too hard on yourself, sweetheart. Like grandma always says. We're here to help each other, right? Yeah. And you'll always be here for Christmas. Promise auntie Mel? I promise. Yes. I will. Thank you very much, Merry Christmas. Thank you very much. You're getting cookies, great. You want cookies too? Here you go. - Oh yeah, here you go. - Thanks. Thanks. - Melody. - Yeah? Are you staying for Christmas this year? I sure am. Well, would you consider being a guest choir director for us? I would love that. So would we. Looks like she's just where she's supposed to be right now. Yeah. Thank you. Of course. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, pastor Hayes. Bye. Excuse me, I'm in the market for a chocolate yule log with a buttercream filling. Well, I'm sorry sir, but we're all sold out of those. However, might I interest you in our Christmas banana loaf? Okay, yeah, this banana loaf here? No, silly. This banana loaf. That's heavy, okay. I'm also looking for whatever this is, what is this? A reindeer Candy jar? Yeah. Here, take two. - Ooh. - Bleah. Okay, off to the tree lot. See you there. Well, you don't want to settle and you can't go to court. That leaves you in a bit of a pickle. The only choice is to find the original copy of that song. I know, and I'm running out of time. Hey, what about this one? Yeah. Look, this one's even better. You know Mel, when I said that I needed more decorations for the tavern, I didn't necessarily mean more trees. Chase. A tree is the ultimate Christmas decoration. Everyone knows that. Yeah. Yeah, I know that. Come on. How can you not fall in love with this? Oh, and that smell, that fresh cut evergreen smell. Yeah. I've missed this. What? You know what'd be the perfect distraction from this whole song controversy? Tell me. Write a new Christmas song. My mom always told me, the key to a good popcorn garland is to use day-old popcorn. Fresh is too brittle, falls apart too easily. It's the older stuff that works best. I don't know if we're doing the right thing here. What do you mean? The trees in here are gonna look great with these. You wanted a more Christmassy look for the trio tonight. No, I mean about the song. Everybody uses the same chords and lyrics from time to time. It's bound to happen. So what if Melody did write that song all those years ago, like she said? I mean, she'd be admitting to something that she didn't do. Look, Connie. As your manager, it's my responsibility to protect your brand and make your career successful. As your husband, I just want you to be happy. We just want what's right, nothing more. Maybe this whole situation will get you out of your rut. Get your creativity flowing. Get you back on the charts where you belong.

Okay. ♪ Every gift I wrapped ♪ every hymn I know ♪ every Bake Sale ♪ every Christmas show ♪ I don't get home much, but love this place ♪ ♪ I'm grateful for every smiling face ♪ ♪ and under the tree, singing carols too ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas, I've missed you ♪ ♪ and walking in the snow, just like we used to do ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas, I've missed you ♪ ♪ every decoration, every celebration ♪ ♪ the magic I once knew ♪ now that I'm home again, I know it's the truth ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas, I've missed you ♪ That's all I've got so far. Yeah. That was so amazing! Thank you. Really, you think so? You guys both have to sing it, for the whole town! Lucy has a point. It's like you two haven't missed a beat. The last time you performed together was at the Madison Christmas concert well over a decade ago. I'll have to check the tapes. Yes, they could sing it at the Christmas concert. But the town hasn't done that in years. I know that, but I'm saying they could sing at the Christmas concert this year, if we put one on. Why not? Yeah. Why not? Well, there were budget issues in the town council, and the Christmas concert just fell by the wayside. Let's bring it back. Hey, I think Lucy's on to something. She might be. It would really bring the town together. It was always dad's favorite night of the year. It'll be the most Christmassy Christmas concert anyone's ever seen! And we could do it on December 23rd, just like we used to do. Tradition. What do you think, Chase? Well, it's a lot of work for five days. But yeah, I think we should do a Christmas concert. - I think that's a great idea. - Yes! All the proceeds will be donated to charity, and don't worry about the budget. I can sponsor it, and maybe Madison Candy can help out too, like they used to. Well Tyler's music store can pitch in. Well so can Mattson's tavern. Hey, do you hear that? What? The sound of a plan coming together. Nerd. Hi Burt. Let me guess, wishing me a Merry Christmas. Of course. Merry Christmas. And looking for a status update on the "Heart Of Christmas" situation. Well. Well, we're still thinking about your offer. Christmas is less than a week away. Listen, Piper, we can't let this drag on forever. Let's just settle. Cute as a little button. I love this. Can you sing? While juggling? I mean, just at all. I don't know. Never tried it. Okay. Mr. Tyler. That is one adorable Christmas sweater. Thank you. Mrs. Tyler made it herself. Are you going to sing for us? Well I was thinking I might do a reading, if I may. - Yeah, go for it. - Of course, of course. Sounds good. 'Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care. I think we should settle with Connie like today. Today? Yeah, I'm getting really nervous. If we go to court, it will be a public relations nightmare. I haven't done anything like this before. Okay. Don't settle with Connie, don't do anything. We still have until Christmas to figure it all out. And then what? And then we cross that bridge. I just feel so helpless, like I'm letting you down. Any time my phone rings, I'm worried it's the lawyers or the record company or... Piper, you need to get out of the office. Just take a break, go for a walk. A walk? Yeah, go somewhere nice, somewhere festive, somewhere Christmassy. I don't know, take your nephew to see Santa Claus. What was it we were just saying the other day? If you love something enough, you should make time for it. So make time for Christmas. Go out and enjoy the season with your family. Okay, I will. And you'll be okay? Yeah. I'm more than okay. It's funny, family has a way of making everything okay. All right. Thank you. And Piper? Yes. Turn your ringer off. What? Turn your ringer off. Just enjoy yourself, don't worry. Anything that we miss, we can deal with later. Thank you, Melody. And Merry Christmas. That's the spirit. You okay? Great. What'd I miss? Well, Mr. and Mrs. Reese did a great version of "deck the halls", probably the best fa-la-la-la-las I've ever heard in my life. That's high praise. Yeah. This town is full of talent. Speaking of which. Hey! Hello, you two. Hey. So we'd like to sing a song together. Great. What are you guys gonna sing? We'd like to sing one of my dad's favorite Christmas carols. I can't think of anything more perfect. ♪ And wonders of his love ♪ and wonders, wonders of his love ♪ That was really beautiful, everyone. One last thing I could offer, it's kind of hard to teach this, but always sing from the Heart. It's something I learned right here, singing hymns and Christmas carols, and some of my own songs too. Thank you. Have a good day. Melody. - Hey. - Hey. Thanks for doing this, Melody. My pleasure. I have something of an odd question for you. I like odd questions. It's the even ones you have to watch out for. Sorry, I couldn't resist. This is a bit of a leap of faith, but do you remember a song I used to sing here called "Heart Of Christmas?" Yes, how could I forget? Lovely tune. By any chance, did I leave some of my music sheets here for others to use? I don't think so. Is it important that you find them? Kind of, yes. You will. How can you be so sure? Anything lost can be found again. Especially if it's in your Heart. Mr. Tyler has the pa covered. And the lighting kit arrives tomorrow from Nashville. And you're gonna need Christmas lights. Lots of Christmas lights. Yeah. You know, I might have an in with Santa. And I think he's got a lot of lights in the north pole. You know Santa? Well, yeah, I know a guy who knows a guy who knows Santa. Now the truth comes out. Well, look, I never said I knew him. You kinda did. I did meet him at a party. Lucy's gonna love this one. A portable speaker to listen to her music with. And it has a Bluetooth inside, whatever that means. Melody, I was thinking I'd like to celebrate Christmas on the 26th this year, if that's okay with you. Oh yeah, that's fine mom. Wait, what did you say? You're off in your own world again. I am so sorry. I just, I have a lot on my mind. I know, you're still trying to find that song. I believe it's gonna turn up somewhere. And would Chase be another one of those things on your mind? It's like when you lose something and then you find it again, and it's the same, but different, in a really good way. That probably doesn't make any sense at all. No, of course it does. I mean timing is everything. Maybe you and Chase weren't ready back then. And maybe you are now, that's just something you're gonna have to figure out. It would be so much easier to just write a song about it. In any case, it's just nice to see you two working together again after all this time. It makes me really happy too. Chase has been so incredible about organizing the whole event, I couldn't have done it without him. It's such an important night, for so many reasons. I'm out of wrapping paper. Do you mind getting me some? Yeah, no problem. I keep it in your father's study. Okay. Which one do you want? I'll take the one on the right, you take the one on the left. How about I take the one on the left, you take the one on the right? - Deal. - Okay. Hey, where's your Santa hat, professor? Get to work. Come on, Piper, pick up. Piper, this is Philip Green calling again from the offices of Hunter Hamilton. I have a very special invitation for your client Melody Jones. Please give me a call as soon as you get this. Big smiles! Big smile, let's see. Show auntie Piper those teeth! I love that one. Come on, Tyson! Auntie Piper's gonna get us some hot chocolate! Switch? Switch. Okay. I almost forgot. Are these the famous Madison Candy homemade Candy canes? They sure are. These are my favorite. My favorite too. - Hi. - Hi. Hello. Everything okay? Yes. - Yeah. - Very good. Everything's great. Great. How are you? I'm great, thanks. What's going on? We're decorating Christmas trees. Yeah, you know how I always say the ultimate Christmas decoration is a Christmas tree? That's what we're doing, that's why everything's great, it's great. Very repetitive. Yeah. Anyway. I'm gonna do a quick kitchen inventory. That sounds like fun. It will be, thanks. Yeah, that's gonna be cool, have fun. You guys have fun. Goodbye. That was smooth. Thanks, it's a gift. That was a nice moment. But? I'm not sure if I'm ready to... Yeah. And I don't know where I'm at. Right, and I'm very busy too. Yeah, with your career. And I didn't get in the way of that last time, I don't wanna get in the way of it now, that's for sure. Exactly. We're on the same page. Yeah. Right, so, yeah. But that was a nice moment. Yeah, it was. I hope this is good news. I just finished singing all the Christmas cards for the office and I'm about to deliver them personally, so I'm in a very festive mood. I've left several messages with Melody Jones' manager, and I can't locate Melody directly in Nashville. Phillip, there's a line form one of my songs. "Home is where the Heart lives". Yes. Well Melody's not from Nashville originally. Did you know that? It's Christmas. You find the home, you'll find the Heart. And that's where you'll find Melody. Or rather, that's where I'll find Melody. You're going to find Melody? There's no substitute for the personal touch. Merry Christmas, Phillip. Merry Christmas, H.H.. So have you decided if you're gonna take that Connie Black settlement and just put all of this behind you? Well, I never did find that original music. I do know what dad would've said about this whole lawsuit business. "What's right is right". I can't live a lie by settling, and I know we wrote that song, and it means everything to me, so I've decided I'm going to go to court. Let the chips fall where they may. And I know I have the support of my family, and that's what matters most. I know what else dad would say. What's that? "Let's eat". Lucy, you can take a break from guitar, sweetheart, it's dinner! Okay mom! That's that, okay, good. Are you expecting someone? Not that I know of. Evening ma'am. How are ya? Can you excuse me? Can someone please come and check if Hunter Hamilton is standing outside my door? Sure is a lovely spread, ladies. This is about the tastiest ham I've had this side of the Tennessee river. What about the Mississippi? That too. It's such an honor having you hear, you have no idea. My father used to play me all of your records when I was just a little girl. You were his favorite singer. Well, mine too, of course. And Dolly, and patsy, and Connie Black. Can't forget about Connie. She's been going through a bit of a rough patch. Hasn't had a hit record in a few years. I hope she can turn things around. Yeah. Now, may I say, you are one tough lady to find. Well, I've been trying to stay out of the spotlight lately. Well, I've never been one to hem and haw, so I'll get right to it. Melody, your song "Heart of Christmas" touched me. Thank you. And as you may know, I have this special coming up. The Hunter Hamilton Christmas Special, of course. I grew up watching it every year, we all did. Well, I was wondering if you'd be so kind as to sing a duet with me on the show. What? Are you serious? Yes. I would be honored. This would be a dream come true. Yes. It's settled then. Tomorrow night at the Troubadour Theater in Nashville. Tomorrow night? So December 23rd? Yep. Is that a problem? That's pretty cool. Okay, yeah. It works. - Hey. - Hey. Look at this. Instant mashed potato snow. That looks great. Yeah. Tomorrow's the big night, you excited? What's wrong? Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Hey, can I give you that? What's up? Okay, something really strange just happened, and I have to tell you about it. Okay. Hunter Hamilton showed up at Jillian's house, and he stayed for dinner. Yeah, that sounds weird. He wants me to perform on his Christmas Special, and he wants to do a duet with me. That's incredible, that's a dream come true, what's the problem? It's in Nashville. Right, okay. December 23rd. December, yeah, tomorrow, December 23rd. Same one, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, the town is all ready, and we can just cover, I'll cover for you here, and the volunteers... I haven't decided. What do you mean you haven't decided? It's a dream come true, it's Hunter Hamilton, it's the king of country. But I made a promise. To who? To everybody, to the community, to Lucy, to you. We will be fine here. Really. I've managed without you before, I can do it again. Well sure, but I was just starting to feel like maybe I belonged here, you know? Like this is my home. What, you're gonna move here? Well why not? Country singers do that all the time. Make base in their home town, and go where they need to go. You have a hit song on its way to number one. Nashville is music city, it's always been your dream to live there. But things feel different now. How? I'm different now. Everything feels different. You have a responsibility. Responsibility, right, like when you took over the tavern. That's right. And you didn't come to Nashville with me. Well. Not everyone gets to follow their dreams, Mel. And if you miss out on them, sometimes they don't come back. You have to go. Is that really what you want? Fine. Mel. It's not an easy decision. Which concert to play tonight. And I have to tell Burt and Connie I'm not taking the settlement. What does your manager say? Piper? She'll be fine with it. She's been taking sleigh rides and ice skating with her nephew, so I haven't really had time to talk to her much. Which is great, I'm glad she's finally taking time for Christmas. Sounds like you have a lot on your plate. And Chase and I had an argument. I'm sorry, honey, I'm sure you two will get past it. Your Heart will tell you when it's time. Speaking of hearts, I heard "Heart Of Christmas" is a smash hit. It's topping the charts, that's a pretty sweet Christmas treat. Yeah, it sure is. I just wish dad were here to see it, mom. Our song, touching so many people? Oh honey, you have to know how proud your father was of you always. For him, "Heart Of Christmas" was a gold record, from the day you wrote it. Not just because it's a beautiful song, because you two created it together. For him, that song is the gold record on the wall in the study. Yeah. It's like that little rhyme he always used to say. "It's not the gold record on the wall". "It's what's behind the gold record "that touches us all". Yeah, I really messed up. Why didn't you tell her how you really feel? I thought I did. You did? You told her that you're basically still in love with her and have been since the day you broke up? What? Well, Chase, come on. Everybody knows. It's Madison's worst-kept secret. From the mayor to Mrs. Wilson who works at the general store, to the guy who runs Santa's Wonderland. - Joe knows? - Yeah. I just never knew how to deal with it. Or how to even talk about it. Sometimes talking about love is harder than being in love. Just didn't want to get in the way of her dreams. What made her happy. Maybe what makes her happy is you. Ever think of that? Trust me. Tell her how you feel, and do it now, before she leaves. I'm a little out of practice. You're just out of tune. Speak from the Heart? Like a good country song. And I bet you all the eggnog in the tavern she feels the same way about you. Careful, that's a lot of eggnog. I know. Hey, Chase. Hey, Jillian. Is Mel here? You just missed her. She left for Nashville. Right. Yeah. I guess she's got that show tonight. Yeah. Hey, looks good. - Hey. - Hey. How'd it go? Yeah, she went to Nashville, to do the duet with Hunter. I'm sorry. Hey, look, it's okay, I'm happy for her. We got our own show to do. Yeah. So, let's finish up. Okay. I just got a call from Hunter Hamilton. Can you believe it? A spot in his Christmas show tonight. What? It's exactly the boost you need. I had no idea you were even talking to him. I didn't, I thought you did. No! I wonder who did. Hey Burt, hey Connie. Am I interrupting something? Not at all, we have news. Connie's performing on the Hunter Hamilton Christmas show tonight. That's just amazing, Connie, congratulations. Thanks. And I assume you are too. Is that why you're here? Do a little tune-up on the stage like the old days? Actually, we have a little matter to settle up, if you recall. Right, that's the news we've been waiting to hear. And right before the Christmas deadline. Well, I had to do this in person. Naturally. But I would like to talk to just Connie, if that's okay. Burt, take a hike, please. Two ladies want to chat. Fine. Check check, one, two. Check one, two. Sounds good. Yeah, we won't need the second mic after all. Okay. Thanks though. Yeah. Thanks. Actually, let's just go with the floor mics. Your very first Nashville gig was right on that stage right there. And you were so nervous, but you got through it. Yeah. And when I heard you sing, I'd never heard anything like it. And I said to myself, that girl is gonna be a star. That was a different time, I guess. Yeah, I guess it was. Speaking of different times. I have something I want to show you, from a different time. What's this? Funny, my dad had this old saying. It went "it's not the gold record on the wall, "it's what's behind the gold record that touches us all". Thanks dad. It's dated 18 years ago. That's about 10 years before you wrote "Heart Of Tennessee", right? We could have it age authenticated. Melody. There comes a time in your life where your star doesn't shine as bright anymore. I get it, really I do. I just really wish when I told you I'd written this all those years ago, that you would've believed me. I'm telling Burt to call the it off. Forgive me? I already have. I really have to run. I am gonna be late. I guess I have to go for a soundcheck at the troubadour too. So, are you gonna sing "Heart Of Christmas?" Say, would you like to sing a duet? Just for old times' sake. I do like a good duet. Hey, break a leg tonight, Connie. It's really good to see you back. Merry Christmas, Melody. Merry Christmas. Good evening, and welcome everyone. I am so delighted to be hosting tonight's concert. And we're gonna start things off with a special mother-daughter performance. Now they've never been on a stage before, but they're world-famous here in Madison. Please give a warm round of applause for Jillian and little Lucy! Thank you. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the technical people for making the live stream of this concert tonight possible for my husband Bill overseas. Hi Bill. Hi dad. Miss you. Hey, sweetie. We love you, and Merry Christmas. And Merry Christmas to all the service men and women who are watching tonight.

Thanks everyone. This song was meant to be a duet, but Melody got called away, unfortunately, so I'm gonna do it alone, which is the first time I've done that in a while, so bear with me.

What happened with the Hunter Hamilton concert? I gave my spot to Connie Black, but Hunter and I are talking about doing a spot together at the Opry in the new year. Well, he's your dream duet. My dream duet is standing right in front of me. I'm going on tour in the new year, you wanna join me? I'm gonna have to check with my people. Yes I wanna join you. You heard the audience. They want another! Okay. Well, you know the first rule of show business. Always leave them wanting more? More please. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
