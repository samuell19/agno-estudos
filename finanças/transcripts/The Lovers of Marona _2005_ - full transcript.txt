The rays of the sun melted the wax... ...with which the young man had attached rows of feathers to his wings, and he fell. Period. A tragedy has occurred, now he is drowning. He is sinking into the sea, but no one notices. Period. Neither the peasant ploughing the field, nor the merchantman sailing onward, not the shepherd gazing into the sky. Period. No one noticed the death of Icarus. Period. Only the poet... ...and the painter... ...observed this death... ...and recorded it... ...for posterity. End. Well, that's it for today. Ola! Ola! Can i help? Jodsik, i'm teacher, not Ola, and keep an eye on Picu?. He's pissed on the school's night-scented stock again. Picu?? Picu? doesn't piss. Why haven't you been to school for a week? Because father's sick. Did you see those toadstools in the birch wood? How nice and colourful they were, like in a dream. I don't have time for dreams. Exercise books, are they so important? Are toadstools important? Let's go and pick toadstools. Let's go and pick toadstools. Well, come on. Don't just look. Sister Eufrozyna says that the one with the beard will kick the bucket soon. I'm sure sister Eufrozyna doesn't say kick the bucket, she says die. Let's go. You'll soon see. Look! Do you see? Isn't it beautiful? J?zio, take the dog. Get down, it's windy up there! I'll be fine. But it'll harm even the healthiest person. What's it got to do with you? Nothing. Picu?, we're going. Have you escaped from the nursing home? I haven't escaped, i've just got away for a while. - You don't look ill! - Exactly. And there you go, bothering me about my health. Don't be angry. Jesus, why are you doing that? Hey, why are you doing that? Are you crazy? Well, shall i give you a lift somewhere? There's no need. I live here! - In school? - Yes! Professor in that case, perhaps you'll teach us something? Jesus, will you stop? Stop it, do you hear? Stop it. Get on home, now! I know, perhaps you'll invite us to tea? I'm inviting you to tea! Come in. Why haven't you gone? Are you in such a hurry? Yes. I'll take you. You won't be late. Late for what? For... In a minute... i'll go get the tea. Have you been following me? Yes. I want to know what will come out of this. Give it a rest. Nothing will come of it! Stop pretending. You're already scheming. That's why i brought you to this nursing home. Nursing home? This morgue? Here i am. Are you ill as well? Terminally ill! There you are. - How many lumps of sugar? - A lot. What time do you have to be back? I've got a pass-out today! He's lying as usual. And you? No, i never lie! I mean, where are you spending the night? Here perhaps? Perhaps over there. I'm a bit of a gypsy! A girl escaped with gypsies, with rags, she's watering the horses with the boys, the boys, the gypsies, the gypsies, the guitars, the rags, the blackberries. Dark eyes with blackberries - wet hair looks like a hedgehog because the gypsies eat hedgehogs, because the gypsies... ... steal horses... ... the horses escape from the water and sneeze, like guitars, she bathes the horses with guitars, with blackberries, with grenades, with gypsies, with the boys! Watch it, so many women were tricked by this! And what are you doing here? I'm just listening. Good morning. You sing so wonderfully. My husband has a guitar in the cupboard, and i thought it might be even more wonderful. You have such a wonderful voice. You sing wonderfully... And what are you doing here? Get out of here. I'm pleased. I'm pleased that you came and visited us here, because Ola's all alone here. She deserves a little fun. And that's exactly what we're giving her. You're very funny. Have you come from far away? Curiosity killed the cat. Janek has just arrived at the nursing home. - Really? You don't look like... - Like what? Oh, why don't you sing something! Please, you sing so wonderfully, that was a song about... about gypsies, wasn't it? Yes. But no, i can't sing with a guitar accompaniment! Please sing, i beg you. I'm watering the horses with the boys, with the boys, with the gypsies, with the gypsies, with guitars, with rags, with blackberries... Hey! Dark eyes with blackberries, wet hair lokks like a hedgehog because the gypsies eat hedgehogs, because gypsies... ... steal horses. Hey! Because over the depths... Wonderful. I'm watering horses with the boys, with the boys with gypsies, with gypsies with guitars, with rags, with blackberries... Who on earth was that funny woman? The director's wife! I'm going to be in trouble because of your visit! In that case, let's go to our place! Your place? We're renting a hut from Gulbi?ska. She's a friend of sister Eufrozyna from the nursing home, isn't she? How are you renting it? Ola! We're here. - Good morning. - Good morning. Janek, what are you doing, wandering about? You know you're not allowed to. Get back to the nursing home, or else they'll throw you out in the end. Mrs. Gulbi?ska! Please serve supper for everyone. Mr. Gulbi?ski... Will you give us a little hooch? No, no, no. There's no way out of it! Whatever we've got, you've got to have as well. You never expected an evening like this, did you? Quick. There's no cheating involved. I'm not asking for anything. And now, down the hatch... Jesus! Janek, not a drop! - Who's stopping me? - I am. Nobody can stop me from anything. Only you can stop me from... ...dying. What did Arek do with mrs. Hornowa's guitar? I smashed it against a boulder! Yes i'm a hooligan. Eufrozyna! Eufrozyna! Damn! Where are those pills?! I already gave him some today! Wait. Wait. It's all right. It's all right. Get out, do you hear? I said get out, do you understand!? I'll stay with him. Well, get out, i say! - Janek, Janek. - Come on. Janek. Picu?, come! Is he going to die? Everyone's going to die some day. But he..., You're talking as if he's come to terms with it. It only looks that way. But you don't know anything about me. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... And what are you doing here? Tell me. I'm going to sleep here. What are you talking about? This is school. Dad threw me out of the house. Dad said i'm not his son. Come. You can sleep at my place, on the rug. You're 'it'! 'It'? Well, chase me! Chase me, because if i catch you you'll be sorry! You're 'it'! You're 'it'! You don't scare me! You're 'it'! I'll bring him. I'll take care of the money, and don't worry about a thing. Go and deal with the professor! Well, here i am. They are going to throw you out of there in the end. Don't you want to get well? Is there a reason to? Yep. Come. You spying on me again? Do something about that damned dog at last! Yes, teacher. Come, Picu?. What if i take all of this seriously? I wouldn't advise you to. Janek... can you... What? Can you smell them? Lilies of the valley? Can you smell the lilies of the valley? - Lilies of the valley? - Lilies of the valley. Like in Ostro??ka. Will you go there? They never smell anywhere as nice as in Ostro??ka. Can you smell them? Eufrozyna! Janek. The guy with the beard is dying. Now i know what it's like! I've seen it. I don't want to be alone when it happens. Well, stay then. Come to my place. Don't complicate the simplest matters. Come. It's not so easy. Easy? If you knew how i feel right now, you'd understand how easy it is. Please come. Your forehead is cold. - I'm all cold. - Let go. I'm evil, rotten, i tell lies, i've never loved anyone, and i don't love anyone now, i always tell lies! Nice weather today, what? So you're having guests again? I don't know. The weather's nice, so perhaps they'll come. But you have guests even when the weather's bad, and at night as well. The Whole village is talking about it. And those visits of his, they're having a bad effect on you, Ola. You've been crying a lot recently. J?zio drowned the dog! It's only an animal, Ola. - A child has killed his own dog! - Well... That child has the makings of a criminal! He has the makings of a human being. I have to go back today. What shall i tell them? Tell them to come. We can have a talk at last. And there's something else i wanted to tell you. You know what? That's not a man for you to marry. I'm not thinking of getting married! Every girl thinks of getting married. What are you trying to say? My husband says it could end badly, and he doesn't joke. Barefoot? I got my shoes soaked, let's go for a sail in the lake. I've never been by the lake, and i've lived here two years already. Two. Two. But it might harm Janek? Nothing will harm him no, he feels fine apparently, he even paws Eufrozyna. Dry your feet you might catch a cold. I read somewhere... ...that scholars have recently figured out that in 11,000 years' time, people won't have little toes any more. Let me dry your feet. Perhaps they should be rubbed, rubbed, rubbed you got hot... ...but you'll have some dumplings, won't you? Shall i bring you some? I can't stand this autumn! And autumn is followed by winter. Stop fooling about. Stop it, stop it! - With gypsies, with rags. - Give m a rest, will you? It's so peaceful here, stop yelling. It's so nice here. Can't it be like this until the very end? He won't sell this lake. No chance of that. He's in love with it. Who won't sell it? That stupid fisherman? We'll finish him for good! No, you can't do that. I can, for punishment. Apparently he gave your J?zio a good thrashing, no? And how is he? I'm afraid he might run away. He drowned his dog, but in fact i like people like that. After all, i run away from home myself, and i'm still running. Nothing good came out of it for you. You're still referring to the clink, aren't you? Were you in prison? - Yes. - What for? Go on, Arek, tell Ola what for. He raped a girl. - And what are we doing now? - How should i know? Let's surrender ourselves to the water. But it's cold. He's not supposed to sit like that. Well, let him walk on the water, and we'll see how holy he is. Jesus, - the boat's leaking! - Didn't i tell you? We are bound to each other for better or for worse. Help! Stop screaming, it's pointless. Help! We've got to do something! Well, we can only make love now. Don't frighten me. You think he's better? Every woman has passed from me to him. Don't believe him, Ola. - He doesn't know me. - But i know you. How can you know what i tell women? - Because i hear you! - I've never told you! Janek. Don't do it! Jesus, who are you?! I wanted to say goodbye to you. He stole it, he simply stole it. Have you seen J?zio? He's stolen 300 zl. From the office. You're imagining things. You're hiding a thief, Ola. I heard the window make a slamming sound. Did he jump out? He must have. J?zio! J?zio, it is you? If he dies, it'll be all your fault. It's because of Arek... Arek, black devil. Janek has to have a hearty breakfast. Preferably eggs and bacon, coffee, three spoonfuls of sugar. Three... Oh, and please don't forget second breakfast, preferably around noon. Noon... Oh, and Janek doesn't like sleeping against the wall. - He says the wall suffocates him. - Suffocates him? Janek? Yes, Janek! - Did you send it? - The money? Yes. Have i ever let you down? Have you heard anything from Ba?ka? Don't worry! I won't let any harm come to them. If this deal with the lake pulls through, they'll be rolling in money for the rest of their lives. You'll end up in the clink. It'll be because of you, you know... ...and now go to her. Shut the window, i can't listen to this any longer. - He's coming to us. - Oh, to us. Shut the window. Where is he? Hasn't he come to stay with you yet? He's staying at Gulbi?ska's. They threw him out of that nursing home. At last. And now what? Are you performing... the last offices for him? I don't like it when you talk like that. If he hasn't slept with you yet, there must be something wrong with him! You're jealous. Perhaps i'm jealous of you! Where did he catch that disease? He says he got it in prison. That's what he says. I don't believe what he says. So how can you love him? What's he really like? He's different for me and different for you. I'm not particularly attached to him, and it's not worth making a fuss over him. You're too good for him. It's best to leave him alone. I don't care what he's like. And i don't want to know what i mean to him. It won't change anything. Ola. My husband wants to see you. Ola. It's difficult to start a conversation with you. It's about my guests, isn't it? You have the right to receive anyone you want in your room. It's Janek you're worried about. Yes. You know that he's very ill. - That's not important. - It is important for my pupils. He'll infect them. Infect them. You have visitors not just in the daytime. In that case, why don't you dismiss me? How do you intend to pay that fisherman? It's enough to draw up a deed before a notary public. But what if he backs out? Then i'll make him change his mind. I don't want to do this deal with you! In that case, how will you provide for them and that son of yours? - I'll manage - How? You'll be dead soon. Have you paid Gulbi?ska? You have a guaranteed roof over your head until the new year. And after that? What happens then!? I think Ola will come and live with you. You've got two wives now, and i haven't got one. Are you crying? No. That's good. - Please leave! - Throw him out. That's the way it must be. How wasteful nature is. Hope must die... ...before that single reed blossoms again. I don't want to leave them. I don't want to die. I'll never leave you, i swear. Janek! Arek! Janek! Janek, Jesus, hang on! Jesus! You're soaking wet. Turn over, oh God. Where is he? Will he come back here? He will. - He always comes back... - Wait. ...he comes back to me. I'm sorry. I'm awake anyway. But i'm sorry all the same. What for? For the fact that they threw you out of the school. They threw you out of the nursing home, too. Because i'm ill. So what? Well... I know you have a wife and child. Come to me. Aren't you scared? Are you happy? Yes. Yes. You're lying! You're lying! - You can't be happy with me! - Sleep. - Sleep. - Sleep. Sleep. You crazy? There's nothing else to do! If i only wanted to. People kill themselves over me. There's no one else like me at work, i... I'm not in such a bad state. - Yes? - Yes! You bet. Just don't say i've no strength. - I didn't say anything like that. - But you thought it. Your thoughts are against me. It's freezing. What a night. There's no moon. It's going to snow again. We lovers are lying here in the snow in Marona. Did you know there is such a village? There'll never be a night like this again. There will. There'll be thousands of them. I ought to say goodbye to them, to my son. How old is he? Four. Why did you marry? I had a bet with Arek. When you're 19, you have no idea about love. You don't know that death. Love is as strong as death. - Wake up, man. - What? My son. You were supposed to go to the notary public today! - J?zio has escaped. - Get up, you scum! - I waited all day with the client. - What client? J?zio! Jesus! Oh, blood, what the... What are you doing? I'm going. Where? To them. Come back, you've got a temperature. Idiot. Come on. Leave me. Be careful. Give me a cigarette. There. Janek, you have to go back to that nursing home. No. I'll talk to Eufrozyna. No. You'll heal me. You've already healed me. You are not afraid of me, we'll live in the forest, Arek, I know there is no death. You are with me, you'll always be with me, Basia, Basia... You'll be there? I will. I'll work... ...in Ostro??ka. And the lilies of the valley... ...are growing for me in the woods. Move away from the wall, will you? The wall is suffocating you! Move away, please! Mrs. Gulbi?ska! Mrs. Gulbi?ska! We have to call Eufrozyna. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and Spirit... Don't pray. Arek! He's in pain. Lie him down. Go to the pharmacy. Will that help? I don't know if it will help but it certainly won't hurt. Where's Arek? He should be coming today. It was him who brought these women here. Ola knows? And what will happen when she comes back? They won't fight next to a dying man. Can we go and fetch a priest? Do we need one? Perhaps you can go? No. He can't. I'll go. Are they here? Yes. Where's Ola? She's gone to fetch some medicine. Wait! As soon as you went out, he got worse. Did he ask about me? No. He spoke only about his wife, about Basia. She'll have him until she dies. Please help us. Sit here for a while. All right! May the eternal light shine upon him. Arek!
