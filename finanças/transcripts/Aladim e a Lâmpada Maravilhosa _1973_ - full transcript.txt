WE DEDICATE THIS MOVIE TO THE MEMORY OF AURÉLIO TEIXEIRA "ALADDIN AND THE ENCHANTED LAMP" It seems to be here. I want total silence now, you hear? It's here. Let's go! Could it be that no one noticed this guy has a screw loose? At last, the glory, the fame, and the power! The enchanted lamp that had been lost in the immensity of time... ...is now within my reach. - Our reach! Our reach. But the lamp is worthless without the ring. First the lamp, then the ring. I know who has the ring. Then, the whole universe will be within my reach. It's here. Come on, guys! It's here. But be careful! Careful now. Metal! Stop! Your machine made a serious mistake. It mistook a bidet for Aladdin's lamp. Throw it on the water! Attention! Pay attention, gentlemen! This wonderful elixir came to my hands... through a famous Buddhist monk: Rhadames Zarathustra! This wonderful elixir can cure any disease... and heal any kind of pain! It's astounding! The elixir of longevity! Right here, Ma'am! Who wants one? Look here. One for the madam here. Only five bucks, and you take happiness home with you. Look here. It makes your hair grow, huh? - Give me one! - It cures stomach ache. It cures rheumatism. It cures any disease! You'll bring happiness home with it. - Marina? - What? Go inside and see if that moron has prepared more of the elixir. - Right. - How now, my friends! GOOD FOR EVERYTHING For 5 bucks, you buy happiness! Aladdin? Is it ready? Marina, please don't make me hurry or I'll screw things up. Our customers are waiting! Brazil cherry juice... Brazilian timber tree oil... What's gotten into you, Aladdin? You're taking too long! Marina, you're so pretty... if you enter a doll store, you'd become part of their stock. Oh Aladdin... Baron! Look! God! What now? Worse things have fallen into it. - Steel wool? - It's good... to wash the duodenum and its surroundings. Are you following the recipe? I'm even improving on it. With you here, I'm inspired. Bat drool, pacifier sweat... Quit that nonsense, will you? Just a moment there! Funny guy, eh? Now hurry up and finish it! Marina. - Wake up, moron! - Marina! What, Marina? The police commissioner's coming! Go back to your homes! Scram! I don't want anybody here buying that crap. Go! Go! Quick! The police commissioner is coming our way! Everybody home! Move! Listen up, Draculin. If you keep selling this medicine without license... ...you're going to jail! - Wait up, Mr. Commissioner. - You can't arrest him just like that. - I'll arrest you, then! - Please arrest him. - What? The man wants you. Look, Marina. If it weren't for your sake, your brother would already be in jail. Come here. Come. Go! Look, Marina, it's so easy to fulfill the demands of the law. Pay me a visit. Not in the station, because I always have work there. Pay me a visit at home, and I'll show you how to get a license. Leave it to me, I'll go to your house. I'll go myself. I'm not so busy right now. If you show up at my door, I'll put you in jail! Okay, okay. Marina, I can even provide you with a temporary license... so you may keep your business going, okay? Bye-bye. I'm waiting for you, doll. Listen, Marina. Tomorrow you'll go to the police commissioner's. - No, she won't. - She will. - Won't. - Will. - Won't. - Will. She won't, because she doesn't want to. What are you thinking? She'll go if I want her to go. She won't if I... - She will! - Yes, she will. Marina, think of me. Do this for us. - You will! - Only if I want to, okay? She won't! He'll be fine, Mom. Dr. Mário has been really nice to him. But he needs surgery. How are we gonna find the money? You don't help, you don't do anything... you've never done anything with your life. - You never mend your way! - I have mended my way. But it didn't work. Now take it easy, these things take a little while. In the end everything will be all right, okay? Mrs. Helena? Please, Doctor, is my son going to be all right? Yes, he will. But keep applying those eye drops. Okay. Doctor, how are we going to pay you? Forget about it. I told you, you owe me nothing. After all, Fred was the best goalie our club ever had. He deserves everything we can do for him! - God bless you, Doctor! - He blesses me, all right. Never failed me. Aladdin? Come here. Close the door. - Ouch! - Sorry. That was only a pretext. I wanted to speak with you alone. Aladdin, there's nothing else that I can do for your brother. Nothing? Mom? Will Fred ever see again? He will, my son. He'll see everything again. The weirdest thing. There's a man who'll come to visit us. He comes from afar. Hi. Hi, Marina. I was distracted. Because of Fred? Doctor said there's no cure... unless he's operated in Germany. Twice have I seen Fred save the day as a goalie for the city's team. A surgery in Germany, that must cost a lot. The world is out of joint: so many who don't know what to do with all the money they have... And so many who don't know what to do with the money they don't have. That's right. If only we had a little bit more money... I don't know, Mariana, but I think I'll eventually get rich. - How so? - I don't know, but I will. Then I'll give you everything you want. I'll give you all the roses in the whole wide world. Aladdin, you're an extra cool guy. Aladdin! What is this? Haven't I told you not to flirt with my sister? Such a beauty is way out of your league. - You, too. Get! - Oh! There's one more thing I wanted to tell you. People are already complaining about the recipe. I brought you a new recipe. Speak! Speak! Why don't you speak? It's here. I need oil, where is it? The oil is in the butter can labeled "lard." - Where's the sugar? - Right there. What? Sugar in a salt shaker? In order to fool the ants. Add two eggs. - Aren't you breaking them open? - I already know what's inside. Let's proceed. Two eggs... Here, you go on with it. - Why are you moaning, boy? - It's part of the recipe. - Where did the recipe say that? - Grab two eggs... and put the egg white and the... "yoke." Aladdin! Aladdin! What? Did something happen to Fred? No. Mom told me to fetch you! There's a man in our house claiming to be our uncle! Uncle? Since when do we have an uncle? That's exactly why Mom wants you there. He seems to be very rich. Rich? Then he's gotta be your uncle. Go, Aladdin! My dear nephew. - Nephew? - How quaint! You look just like my brother. Really? Daddy never mentioned that he had a brother. It's true. Maybe... maybe he forgot about it, right? No, now I understand it all. When we fought, I moved to the East. You know how they are, these petty family quarrels. Brother must've taken it seriously, so that in his eyes I was dead. And now, when I decide to come back and make amends... I find this sad news: my brother's passed away! It was a terrible blow for me. Courage, sister-in-law! Wait! Do you have any document that might prove what you just said? Any kind of ID? - This ring. - What about the ring? It has an Arabic inscription, meaning: "I am the light. I am the fortune." I didn't know it had this here. How did you know that? This ring belonged to my father, my grandfather, my great grandfather... and so on. My brother inherited it from my father... and now it's yours, because you're his oldest son. Actually, this ring was the reason why we argued. It is worthless. - You con man! - Calm down! My husband drank that crap and now he's there, with horrible colics! - Maybe he didn't shake it beforehand. - You're full of it! She's right! Yes, she's right, people! This is a scam! A con job! I bought that crap thinking that it would make my hair grow. Now look at what it did to my hair! It's a scam! This guy deserves to be hanged! - I'm calling the police commissioner. - Go ahead! I know that your situation is bad, that your brother needs treatment. Now, since I'm a man of some wealth... ...I'd like to offer you a deal. - What deal? Things here are so ugly, they only get better when they get worse. It's a purely sentimental issue. I'll pay for all your needs... and in exchange you'll give me this ring, as a token of my brother. This ring? How now! Why didn't you just say that you wanted this ring? Wait! Couldn't you choose anything else? No. I'd rather have the ring. You know, this ring is a token of my father. He asked me to keep it. He even made me swear. Isn't there anything else you want? I have canaries, parakeets, chickens... - No, I want the ring. - No deal, then. I'm taking this murderer to be hanged right away! Just a moment! Hold it here. I'll be right back... - Grab him! - Catch him! - Calm down! - Let's hang him! Easy, that hurts! Hurry up, Mr. Commissioner! They're hanging him! Help! Ouch! That hurts! Out of the way! Move! Take that rope off his neck right now! - Let him go. - Thank you! - Draculin, let's go! - I told you to let him go. I don't want to hear another word! This man must be judged and condemned by law! Look! They're getting away! Everyone, go after them! Bye, Mr. Commissioner! I'll introduce you to my friends. Abdallah. - "Saravah!" - Komnokuitacl. Preteritas. And Magnintox. - How! - How! I know you want to fulfill my brother's wish... but I wanted you to show my pals here... that rare inscription on the ring. - Is it in Portuguese or Arabic? - It's in Arabic! That's true. Wanna see it? The ring! - It swallowed the ring! - Save the ring! Get the chickens! I want that ring! What now? Which one ate the ring? The one that swallowed it. The white chicken. - Kill'em all! - Don't do that, mister! Please! Don't kill Guiomar! She's pregnant of a little egg. I beg you, mister! No one touches the chickens! You fools, what are you waiting for? Grab him! Catch Aladdin! Fools! Let go! Oh! The funeral home's mannequin! Mom! Mom! He's not our uncle! He wants to slay all the chickens and he's fighting against Aladdin! Finish him! Hands up! I didn't do anything! Tough old woman! Nobody moves, or I'll shoot! Oops! Come here, naughty girl! Why! Here is the ring. Go for it, Aladdin! Run away now! - Aladdin! - Draculin! Wait up! Hold it! Quick, go after them! - Hurry up! - Look where you put your hand! - This guy only gets into trouble. - Look out, Aladdin! See? This is all your fault! You've ruined the elixir and I almost ended up hanging by a tree. Hurry! Hurry! Worse things have been happening to me. Back home... they've just tried to steal this worthless ring of mine. If they tried to steal it, it must be worth something. - What about this chicken? - It's the chicken of the ring. Chicken of the ring? I'd heard of the hen that lays golden eggs... but a chicken of the ring, that's a first. It swallowed the ring. Now I have to wait for it to give it back. It happened! It happened! Is it the ring? An egg. Ouch! The horror! Such a cute little egg. The police commissioner on one side, the criminals on the other. Now we'll see! Look out! It happened! Now is the ring! POLICE You cut in front of me. Who's responsible for the shooting? Step out of the car! Mother of God! - You're only trouble! - I'm not! - Our partnership is over! - What? - It's your fault they blew our tire. - You sissy! - You're to blame for all this mess! - You're the one who can't drive. - So you want to fight? - I sure do! Ouch! Quit it! Quit it, boy! Note the car plate number. Your documentation, please. - Do you speak English? - Huh? Quiet! - Look at the river! - The river? I'll drown you in it! What's more, our partnership's over! Quiet! Tomorrow you're all summoned to be at the station... from 11 to 11:15, which is when I work, carrying all your documents! Piss off! - Fool! - Calm down! Calm down! Draculin, you can't do this to him. It's not his fault! - Of course it's his fault! - It's nobody's fault. Look how that moron keeps his cool, while we're dying here. Are you dying to go to the bathroom? There's one there. There will never be a shortage of water. Quit that nonsense and let's get out of here quick! Quiet! Easy! Wow! Funny thing. - Aladdin, we're wasting our time. - Let's go! Look here, what a weird little lamp! Let's go, before they find us! Throw away that piece of junk. It's so old, it's worthless. When there's a black-out, we might put oil in it. It's screeching! - Take it! - Away! What is this? - It will explode! - Mother of God! - My God! - What now? - What happened, Aladdin? - Black oil! Run, run, run! I'm the Genie of the Lamp. It's been two thousand years that I wait for a master to free me. Your wish is my command. - For real? - Certainly. Hey black man, have you really popped out from inside this lamp? Yes, master. I'm a slave, at your service. - Really? - I'll do whatever I'm told. Guys, which one of us is dreaming this? - Pinch me. Ouch! - Ouch what? Not there. Not there. Excuse me. It won't hurt trying. Shall we see if this really works? Sure. Hey fellow, change the tire of that Kombi van for me. Yes, master. - Let's see, let's see. - Let's go! - A new tire! - It's brand new! - It worked! Cool! - It worked! - Ask for a new Kombi van for me. - As if! - Find a job, you bum! - Ask! You want it easy? Go push a drunkard down the slope! - They must be near here. - Let's hunt them down. We'll surround them. Come on. Move! Aladdin, may I ask you something? Sure. Ask. Please do. - A new dress? - Oh! You deserve it, Marina. What about me? Hey, chrome-plated guy! - Genie, master. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want a new dress. For her! For her, there! - You're beautiful! - Ravishing! Look, I'm hungry. What do you want to eat? Mortadella sandwich? - I'll have a hotdog. - I want fried turnover. All right. Hey, loose-fitting pants! - Genie, my master. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bring me some food, now, will you? Now that's some lunch! I'll feast on that banquet! - Who knows, maybe it's a mirage! - I'll eat the mirage, too! - If you please. - You go. - No. - Be my guest. - You go. - You go. Hey, Aladdin. Now, a toast to a friend. - What friend? - The police commissioner. Friend?! Cuff the man, Genie. - Grab the wheel! Hold it! - Look out! Tasty food! My God! They're after us! How could we escape? We've been surrounded! - Lord have mercy! - Oh my God! Stay here. Come here, man! Why all this rush? You have the Genie. Genie, please, take us out of this mess, will you? Let's go to the flying carpet. There! Aladdin discovered the power of the lamp and the ring. Now you might as well go back to Palestine. Mom! Mom! GOOD FOR EVERYTHING Mom! Mom! A flying Kombi van! - God Almighty! - We have arrived! Great! Open! Mom! You guys! You're already there, black man? - Yes, my master. - I have news, Mom, news! My son! I saw it! I swear, I saw it, but I can't believe it! I can't believe what I just saw, my son! - I can't believe it. - It's real, Mom. All of it is true. What about this nigger there? You racist! I forgot to introduce him. This is the Genie, Mom. The Genie. He's a friend of mine. Now he's my slave, he does whatever I want. Son, come here. I wonder if he'd do anything, no matter how expensive? Piece of cake. Dear son, I want a new sewing machine. Mine is broken, son. - Ask him. - Hey you, chrome-plated guy... - Genie, my lord. - Yeah, yeah. I want a machine for my mother. - A machine? - Yes. Your wish is my command, master. Oh, son, help me! Lord help me! Oh, I don't want that! Hey, Genie, not that kind of machine! A sewing machine. - Forgive me, master. - Help! - A machine! - It's great! - Amazing! - Look! - How fabulous! - Nice! What a wonderful thing! Oh, God! - Take off your hand, boy! - You're always spanking us, Mom! You're not touching this machine. You've already broken the other one. Not this one. Oh, God, it's fabulous! A wonderful thing! Hey, son. How do I turn it on? Son, do something. Turn it on somehow. Oh, God! - Excuse me. - It's alive! It's alive! It's amazing! What a wonderful thing! It's working. Turn it off, son. Turn it off! Thank you. Excuse me. REJUVENATOR GOOD FOR RHEUMATISM Son, go give your brother a hand. - Okay, Mom. - Leave it to me, I'll go. Hello. Excuse me? I'm Marina. Oh, Aladdin told me about you. I watched you play soccer many times. - Oh, well. - I really enjoyed it. I know. But that's history now. That's not history, Fred! It's only the beginning. There are flying Kombi vans, a Genie, an enchanted lamp... ...and smoke! - I saw it, son, I saw it! There you go! Now things are going to get better! Hey Genie, I'm going to ask you something that we all want. I want you to cure my brother Fred. His sights are a little fuzzy. Unfortunately, master, that is beyond my power. A higher force than mine would be required. I only do material things. But you can give us a ride, then. Can you take us all to Germany? There's a doctor there who's able to cure Fred. - Oh, that I can do. - Now you're talking, black guy! Ouch! Don't electrocute us! - Aladdin! - Draculin, you'll travel with us. - We're going in jail now. - Oops! I forgot to tell him to take the cuffs off of the police commissioner. Genie. Look at that! Look! - Miracle! - Miracle! The police commissioner said that he wants to have a word with you. I knew it! Oh my God! So much joy! - Look, a big party. - Aladdin told me. He's even bringing champagne. Well, son, this is no regular party, though. It's a wedding party! Look at it: the queen of hearts is near the valet of spades. Aladdin. Aladdin... He's going to marry Marina! - Do you see all these lands? - Yeah, they're wonderful. - I'll buy them all. - Really? I'll tell Genie to build a palace. A lake, a sea of roses. - Everything for me and Marina. - What, and nothing for me? - For you, a studio apartment. - But that means... A conjoined apartment. But with a kitchenette. - You miser! - So now I'm a miser, eh? You forget that you persecuted me for flirting with Marina. Now think, what if the lamp and this here stop working? What if the Genie disappears? Then we'll see! Do you want to jinx it? I need to think about everything! Do you want to settle this now? Genie? - Genie? - I'm here, master. Where? - Genie? - Right behind you. - Don't scare me! - I'm ready, at your service. Don't scare us! Now you appear without warning, with no smoke, no screech, nothing. You know? On some people we have to keep a tight leash! Here's the deal... Ouch, don't electrocute us, damn it! Genie? I have a question. What if you suddenly get tired of being my slave and disappear? Or if someone steals the lamp or the ring? What would happen then? In order to recover the lost good... one must undergo many pains. No one has ever succeeded in overcoming the 3 trials of courage. - Three trials? - What are those? They're three trials to test human endurance. First, a man must resist the seduction of women. That's easy. Second, one has to risk his life to save the life of his neighbor. Well, it all depends on who my neighbor is. If he's far... I see it. And finally, one has to conquer the red lily. - Red lily? - Red lily? - What is it? - Gotta see it. Wow, this one must be rough, eh? How are we supposed to find the place? It's on top of this mountain. There you'll find the fate of those who lost the most precious good. We'd better be extra careful, then. Sure. When I leave home, I'll hide it really well. Just imagine going through all that! Be warned! The forces of evil are endangering the lamp and the ring. - Where? - There. Guys, let's get out of here. Don't be stupid, man! Genie is here, he can handle this. That's true! Stay invisible, but alert. We're lucky. Both the lamp and the ring, within our reach. Where's Genie? Genie, make us invisible. You're surrounded. Hey fellow! I'm here! There they are. Let's go! - Here, you clowns. - Come, fools! Here! Here they are! Come! Take that! Now! Scram! Scram! Scram! We're acting like fools. - Do you have a better idea? - I do. I do. I do! We need to use our heads, and the time is now. You're the sorcerer. Good morning, my son. How funny, you have an old lamp, just like mine. Do you wanna sell it? No, this lamp is not mine, it's my brother's. But it's old and ugly. Why don't you exchange it for a brand new one? Look at this one here. It's made of gold. Your brother would appreciate that. Take it. Hey! Come back here! Give me back my lamp! Marina! Marina! What happened, Johnny boy? What happened? My lamp has been stolen! Marina! Grab the lady! Run, Johnny boy! Go find help! - Get in there! - Let me go! - Get in there, woman! - You're hurting my arm! Marina! - Get going! - Help! Somebody help! Help! Marina! Do you expect me to believe something like that? It's true, Dr. Mário! Isn't it, Draculin? I saw it, Doctor. I know it's unbelievable, but the car did fly. Come with us, we'll show you. I won't go. I won't! This is madness, hallucination! Doctor, come with us. It's true! You want some advice? Get out of town as soon as possible. The police commissioner has had enough of you. Doctor, you only have to give us the doctor's name and address... ...and we'll bring him here. - Yeah, Doctor. - The famous German doctor? - Yes. But how could I give it to you? And what about his office? - We'll bring that, too. - That, too. That's insane. Nonsense! This German doctor's famous. Now what's his name? Now please, Doctor, say his name. It's... Wait a minute! It's Dr. William Hernandorfer, he works in Brederfendervinch. - Did you get that, Draculin? - It's Wineofelixir... - My tongue can't say it. - What wine? - His name... - His name is... William Her Irmandorfer, he works in Brederfendervinch. He works where? That's William Her Irmandorfer, he works in Brederfendervinch. That's not it! You're confusing me! The correct name is this: Dr. William Her Irmandorfer, and he works in Brederfendervinch! Dr. Brederfendervinch, who works in Her Irmandorfer! Bow-wow! That's insane! Nonsense! I'm phoning the police commissioner. If he phones the commissioner, we're all doomed. What is that? Hello? Operator? Please call the police station. It's an emergency. I wonder if it's truly ether. Sniff it a little bit. - That's ether, all right. - Draculin? Draculin? Draculin? Better write it down quick. So he'll come bringing the ring... ...and all ends well. - With nobody hurt. Now that I won't do. You want me to betray Aladdin... but I'm not writing anything. Anything at all! - That's only the beginning. - The best part comes afterward. Murderers! You miserable murderers! Quiet! Sit! Sit down! Quiet! Marina! Don't write! Stop! Stop! What do you want me to write? That's his car. The way things go, we'll end up getting the chair. Stealing people, stealing cars! Where did I get myself into? Pull the man. Pull! All right. Put the car here. My coat! Wait a moment. Push the man. Give me a hand, Draculin! Wait! The man stayed there. Draculin! Draculin! Wait! Oh, man! Doctor? Out of the way! Doctor! - Where am I? - You're on my foot, damn it! Oh my God! What happened to Dr. Mário? Mrs. Helena, a glass of water, please. No glass of water! Mom, you don't have to. God Almighty, what is this?! What are you doing to Dr. Mário? He didn't want to believe in my Genie, Mom. Who gave me a shower? I didn't ask for any shower! - Relax, Dr. Mário. Relax! - I demand an explanation! An explanation? You're about to see the biggest of all wonders, Mom! Get down! You're scratching my car! Calm down! I'm so powerful! I'm the king of the world! - What is this? Stop! - The headlight is broken! - My car is one-eyed! - Stop! - Now it's totally blind! - Has this kid lost his mind? You deserve a new car, Doctor! - You don't deserve this, Doctor! - My car is one-eyed! This boy was never good in the head, Doctor. Don't be silly, Mom! I'm gonna set this hut on fire... and I'll tell Genie to put a palace in its place. - I'll send you all to an asylum! - Saint Rita of Cassia, help us! - You're all insane! - That boy has lost his mind! - No, son. Quit it. - Mom, I'll give you a palace! Couldn't Genie do this elsewhere? I don't want to leave here, I'm used to this cozy little home. I don't want to move! Put that down, will you? - Put it down. - All right, Mom. All right. - I saved the house! - My heart! I'm having a fit. Mrs. Helena, would you have a sedative to spare? What? - Thank you very much, Mrs. Helena. - You're welcome. Christ! Look at that! Just look at what happened to my dear VW beetle! Mom! Mom! Did you see anyone touch the oven? No, I didn't, son. I wasn't even here. The lamp is no longer the same. - It's totally different. - If it works, that's what matters. It has to work. Hello, hello, Genie, over! - Hello, hello, Genie, over! - Knock! No? Hello, hello, Genie, over! What's going on? So that's the so-called magic lamp, is it? Magic lamp? The magic lamp is history. - Aladdin, my son! - Mrs. Helena... ...we're going to jail this time. - Oh, God! Someone must have changed lamps. Mrs. Helena, who is going to pay for all this damage? What? Johnny boy must have done this. - I'll bring this to the commissioner! - That's one of Johnny's pranks. That's no prank at all. That's a message. - That's Marina's handwriting. - Mother of God! - What does it say, brother-in-law? - Brother-in-law? It says that if you don't give the ring, they'll kill Marina and Fred. Murderers! Cowards! But we'll strike them a mortal blow! - How? - I'm gonna... No, not I. You. - You'll speak to the commissioner. - Me? Am I to go straight to the wolf's lair? Are you mad? You'll speak to the commissioner while I meet the criminals. So you arrive with the commissioner, we save the lamp, the ring and Marina. - It's going to work just fine. - This will end badly! So, when you need the police, you come rushing in. When you don't, you consider the police... ...evil. - Right. No, no. - Do you remember this? - That was a stupid little prank. - Sorry, Mr. Commissioner. - A stupid little prank, eh? Come here! Hey, Ventania, lock this moron up... so he'll see how beautiful life is behind bars. - I'm innocent! - Go! - Are you taking the lamp with you? - Sure. You don't trust us, but you run the risk of losing the lamp. - Don't start. - What if... Aladdin prepares an ambush to try and get back this thing? - What about the hostages? - If he's got the ring... and he recovers the lamp, then he'll have his brother back, just like that. Careful with it! The lamp stayed here. If only I could get rid of those chains! Relax. I'll try. A toast to you, little Genie. It looks like Magnintox is about to betray Jamal. I think this must be it. It's the only place in ruins. Someone's playing with us. I wonder what these criminals are looking for around here. I can explain it, Mr. Commissioner. Get down, you idiot! Geronimo! - What are you doing here, boy? - I ripened and fell. Oh, thank God! The cards say that his hands are receiving a gift. Oh, thank God! That's great! Do you want to take a sip? Too bad such a pretty girl like you would get into all this mess. But I didn't do it on purpose. And I want out. Who knows, maybe I could help you. Why don't you help me, then? Oh, darling. It's up to you. If it's up to me, then there's no problem at all. What about the blind guy there? Don't worry about him. You have the lamp, don't you? Now I can help you get the ring. - Are you serious, girl? - Why, sure! Or do you think that Aladdin would be foolish enough... to meet Jamal with the ring on his finger? By the way, he doesn't even have the ring. He gave it to me, so I'd hide it. Women are tough, I hadn't thought about that! But I know where the ring is. I'm the only one who knows. - Aren't you playing with me, girl? - Now... if you let us go, you can keep the lamp and the ring. I'll see how things are doing out there. Then I'll be back so we continue this chat. Fred, don't let them notice. A very big house. Like a palace! Oh, and Draculin is inside. - Hey, don't push me like that! - Get in there and shut up! What are you thinking? I know my rights! - Don't push! - Move! - You can't push a citizen like that! - Shut up and turn over here. Excuse me. - So here we are, brother-in-law. - Brother-in-law?! I'm not your brother-in-law! You know what you are? You're an idiot, a stupid, damn fool! - Now say it backwards. - A damn fool, a stupid idiot! - Back to the one who said it first. - Get out of here! What? What are you thinking? At least you saved Marina and Fred. No. However, I did save the ring. No progress, then. This junk is useless without the lamp. On the other hand, the lamp is also useless without the ring. Take off your feet! Attention! Attention. Are you sure you know where the ring is, girl? If you don't believe me, wait until Jamal arrives, he'll tell you. - Come here. - Fred! - My hand! - Let me go! Damn it! You bastard! - No, no, wait! - What? Come! Watch the step. Get down. - This is not it. - Start again. - It's of spades. - Again. There are people here. It's the homies. We must get them away from here, or we won't be able to escape. Wait. Hold this can here. Throw it to your left, as far as you can. - What was that? - I don't know. Some noise there. Let's see. - I think it was around here. - Let's go there. - I can't see anything. - Let's go. Come! Fast! Careful! Come. Aladdin! Aladdin! Aladdin! - Johnny boy! - Listen... Johnny boy, it's good that you showed up. Go tell your mother... to speak with the commissioner. Maybe she can fix things. - Then... - Forget it, Draculin. Johnny boy, go down there and bring me the tip of that chain. - Fine. - And give it here. Then you'll chain the other tip on the back of the jeep. Go! - It won't work. - Of course it will! Dr. Mário, how may I help you? Only madmen do what they're doing! This can't go on. Fine. I'll arrange that they be removed to the state asylum. - Hurry up, kid. - What now? - Do you know how to turn on the key? - No, I don't. But I'll try. The key. Don't you know I came here invited by the commissioner? The key's right there! Great! It started! Now what should I do? - Engage! - Don't! Step on the clutch pedal. Don't intrude on my instructions. Engage. What do you mean, don't intrude? You can't drive! In practice, no. But in theory, I know it. Engage! I can't understand anything. Take turns to speak. Mr. Commissioner, the mayor is on the phone for you, sir. - For me? - Yeah, and it's urgent. Hey, Ventania, ask Dr. Mário to call the mental institution... ...while I call the ambulance. - Yes, sir. Do as I say. Slowly let go of the clutch and step on the accelerator. No, sir. Hey, Johnny boy, aren't there two balls down there? - Three. - Yeah, three. Choose any of them, push it forward, and God help us! - Forward! - Not backward. - The commissioner! - Turn it off and get out of there. Go, go! - The mayor's right. They're mad! - The commissioner. I don't know what's the problem with this car. It's driving me nuts. Everyday! When I engage, the car is put into reverse. When I put it into... I don't know what's happening anymore! Let's go. - Come on, let's go! - My head! Don't pull it too hard! - Wait, let me pass. - Get out of the way, man! Johnny boy, you're a hero! Let's go. Hands up! Give me the ring, before it's too late. It won't come out. Give me the finger. No. Not that one, the one with the ring! - Why did you say it, boy? - Cut off his finger. What? No! Now I have absolute power. Aladdin, I think I'm going home, to ask Mom to see the cards. Perfect, Johnny boy. Go. Why this long face? Don't you know that hope is that last to die? Mine is long since dead. I can feel its stench! Don't you remember what Genie told us, should we lose the lamp? - The three trials! - So? Let's go! - Where are those two? - They escaped. You idiot! You fool! And where's my lamp? Our lamp. It's here. What about the ring? It's here. Allah is great. The lamp. Give me the ring. Give me the lamp. I'll summon Genie. I'll summon Genie! Give me the ring. - Give me the lamp. - Do you think I'm stupid... to give you the lamp? Give me the ring! Give me the lamp! - You idiot! You fool! - You scoundrel! Stop! The lamp is in danger! Stop! Things are getting tough, brother-in-law. This "brother-in-law" business is over for now. Later on, if you get back the lamp, we'll talk. You're some "merchandise," huh? What merchandise, boy? It's "mercenary"! - I was using the plural form. - Let's go! Can you see what I'm seeing? - What are you seeing? - Don't scare me. There! - Just look at these hot babes. - There are no women there, man! If they're not women, then I'm not a man. They're barely dressed! - Aladdin! - I'm on it. Come here. Don't be stupid. Can't you see this is a trial? Then I'm going to flunk it. Aladdin, look out! Aladdin! Draculin! Draculin! - A centipede woman! - There's no one there! That's Marina! My angel! - That's not Marina. - It's Marina! This is the trial, Aladdin! It's the devil! It's not! If Marina's the devil, then I wanna go to hell! - Marina! - Aladdin! - Marina, you fox! - Aladdin! - Stop, Aladdin! - It's her! - No, that's not Marina. - It is her! That's a mirage! Aladdin! Stop! Aladdin! Stop! Marina! Aladdin! Draculin! Brother-in-law! - Save me, I'm here! - Oh, boy! Brother-in-law! Get me out of here! Dear God! Here, Draculin! Wait! Hang in there. - Here! - Hang in there. Get me out of here! You're right, brother-in-law. That wasn't Marina in there. She'd never be capable of doing such a low thing to me. I knew it. Haven't I told you, man? - I'll be damned! - Look! There must be a fortune inside it! Just like those treasures we see in pirate movies. With all these riches, we don't even need the lamp anymore! Easy there, Draculin! That's the second trial! Not my problem. It's your trial! Draculin! Draculin, quiet! - That's the second trial. - I've got nothing to do with it. - I'm going there. - Draculin! This isn't working. A monster! Look at the monster! God Almighty, what now? How are we gonna get out of here? Did you forget about the trial? Genie told you to save your neighbor's life. I'll sacrifice myself, but you don't deserve it! Now! Don't kick fluffily here! Beat it! Beat it, boy! Ouch! Aladdin! Aladdin! Aladdin! Ouch! Ouch! They wanted us for barbecue! Not even a vulture would eat your barbecued flesh! So much fun! What a strong wind! Brother-in-law, let's get out before we have another surprise. Let's go. - The red lily! - Piece of cake! Let's grab it! - One. - Two. - And... - And... Oops... Oops... - We'd better buy it at the fair. - Or we'll come back tomorrow. Run! Look out! - Look! - Oops... Hurry! Relax! Help! Help! - Help! - I'm going! Help! Great, now let's go! Halt! Pray before you die! Go on! Halt! Drop it! Man, we're doomed. They must be in cohorts. Go! Surround them all! - Oh, boy! The commissioner! - Now it's a jam! Get the lily. - It's our chance to get the lily. - Yeah. What now? What comes after "Thy kingdom come"? Quick, quick! Commissioner! Commissioner! - What do I do with the ambulance? - Send it away. - Send everyone away. - Go away. Go away! Hey you, the lily! What? Everything stopped? Even you! Draculin? Listen... - Shall we go now? - Yeah! Yeah! Wait. Let's go! Wait! Come here. Come here. It's our chance. Let's go. Follow me, Draculin! It's so cool! - There's the commissioner. - Let's get out of here. - Look out! - The lily, the lily! - The lily! - Get it! Get the lily! - Keep your eyes on the lily! - I have a cold. Don't soak me! Don't soak me! Let's go, let's go! We must take the Doctor with us, so he'll give the Genie the address. Where are you going? ROSE GARDEN Oh, Marina Today is the happiest day of my life! Then it's your chance to ask for all the money in the world! Oh, Marina Marina, my little rose Marina? Mom! Mom! Gather everyone here. I'm calling my Genie to fix things up. Fred! Marina! All our problems will be solved now. Hey, where am I? Where? Have I died? You see it, Doctor? At your service, master. This will be your last wish. Aladdin, ask for money. Lots of money! All the money in the world. Shut your mouth, Draculin! You only think about money. - What else is there to think about? - You're a mercenary. An egotist! Aladdin, think of your brother. That's true. Money we win and lose. We can always find a way. Fred's surgery is more important, Marina. Oh! Saint Rita of Cassia has heard my prayers! Doc, could you give that doctor's name and address in Germany? What doctor? Oh, yes, I know it! Wait! It's Doctor William Hernandorfer Hermancrocker... Boy, I think I messed it all up! Did you get that, Genie? Did you? I got it, master. At your service, master. You may ask whatever you want. You may ask whatever you want. Besides you, only if I'd ask for the lottery prize! Money! So much money! THE END
