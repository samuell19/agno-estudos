I liked it, I liked it. But I would like you to... to have more strength. As if you were taken full advantage over her. Got it. Like reducing her to tears. Aka'!- Would be okay for you if I accentuate it even more with the look? Perfect. You can use her vulnerability, that she's all alone. - Okay? ' Okay, How did you feel? I don't know. Am I okay? Yes. I like what you did. - Do you? - Yes. Can you repeat it? - Sure. - Okay. One more, guys. Wow... That day I was scared to death. I'm scared to death. Eva, Eva, Eva, Eva. What? No... no. Sorry, Sorry.

What did you said? sorry Could you wait for Salmon and take him to the vet for his shots. Honey, I don't know if I'll have time. I'll let you know. Honey, could you do me a favor? Pass me the hot sauce that's over there. It's all gone. Are you kidding? And you... you couldn't go out and buy some? And you thinkl had the time? Anyway it's not a matter of life or dead, Evi. No, I know it isn't, but... You know what would be really nice? You caring for me once in a while. There you go again. Again; You gotta be kidding me, Eva. You think I don't have anything else to think about besides a goddamn sauce? You're kidding me, Right? This comes from you, who can't even return my damn phone call. Oh God. You know what? I spend my entire day working and I can't be checking on my phone every second. It's not the same. Hey it isn't, because I'm at set you know what it's like, don't you? Don't worry, I haven't forgotten. But you expect me to answer your 300 calls so I can send you one fucking document from your health insurance? That's different. The university and a film set are not the same thing and you know it. No, it isn't. I'm sorry... Good afternoon. My question is for Candela. I'd like to know how it feels to see that your star it's being so renowned at such an important festival? Good afternoon. I'm very happy, Eva did a great job out there, just like our whole crew, I think we've all worked hard and gave our best; that's why we're here. I'm gonna say it. I think that you're too young to move in. You still having time to live. Well you still having the chance to experience, travel around the world, fly in a glider, do a parachute jump, try every drug on earth. I don't know Open minded. Open mind, for sure. You know, Celia, it's just that, Evi is different. I don't know, they are different. Evi is unique... Of course, she's my daughter. Would be weird if she wasn't. Totally. Also, I don't want Cande to live the same thing as with Laura. Marta... Candela's ex. Ex of whom? Mine, Celia. Ah, Candela's. But, don't you worry. She was an unbearable spanish. With no feeling by the way. Right? Titi, I don't think that we should be talking rubbish about someone who's not even here. True. I think the same. I agree with Candela. It's something cultural. Let it be, leave it. - No... - I'm not with you, ma. No it's just that everyone knows that Spaniards are rude. Enough, Eva. Don't say that. Right? No, no, no if you have nothing worthwhile to say don't say anything at all. No. No. Look, I... If Eva is going to move in with Candela, well I'm kind of prepared because... She doesn't call me anymore, or text me. I'm not her priority Momm! It's true. She's always out. Mmm. She's a street creep. You're a rambler. Only whores are street creeps, honey. I didn't mean that. I mean she's always out, Celia. Yes, she's always out. Cheers! Yes. Cheers... Cheers... So, What are you up to, sister in law? So curious. The same thing he's being doing since five years ago Well, that takes time, right? Sure. As everything. It does, it takes time. It's a long-term process, Celia. Yes, writing. Eva wanted to tell us something and I want to hear it. What was it, honey? Stop it. I hate it when you do that, mom. But I do think that what you have to say is important. Tell us... No, time passed, it's not important... - Come on, tell us Evi. - It's not important. Everyone has shared something. Tell us... Okay, I'll tell you. Do you remember yesterday when we were surfing the net... come on! Oh, right, that sensationalist page. Sensationalist?... God for you there's something wrong with everything... Keep going, honey, tell us. Yesterday we were surfing the net and Cande was trying to find some reviews about the movie and suddenly she found one of those pages... Pseudo-film Oh, right, pseudo-film, pseudo-film, pseudo-actors Those terms... seriously, pseudo. Is that even a word? Say it again, Pseudo what? No, but then... then. Hold on, I'm trying to listen what she's saying. The post said something like... Eva Ramirez and her girlfriend parade their love at the grocery store. No way! No. Ah, Can you believe it? And there's a picture of us, at the grocery store. Paparazzi My god, my little girl is a star Right now there could be some of them here I mean paparazzis and everything. Okay, okay. Enough for you honey, honey, enough, pull yourself together, okay. Let's not be like them Honey, enough Honey, enough Honey, enough Honey... enough Uh. Uhh... N00... Ayy sorry No. sorry, sorry, sorry No, it's yours Yeah, right. It's mine. Yes, yours Uy. Uy, W. “W Sorry, sorry, sorry. At least it wasn't a deadly silent one. It was because of my position Yeah, sure. Youre position. Yes and the... Cande... I was thinking. What? What? What Marta said wasn't that crazy, don't you think? What, flutter butt Do you want your mother to really hate me? I think she can't hate you more I'm serious I'm tired of giving explanations and being forced to live with that man... He's your dad. I know, but you know how it is. Mmmm... got it. You're using me as an excuse so you can leave home No, silly... it's not that at all. I mean it, you know that. I'm making more money, and with the series; we could live in a bigger place, our place. A move? No, I hate moving! I don't have the time? Honey, Don't be lazy. Okay, but your movie didn't have a warm reception by critics. Aren't you concerned? No It's always a challenge to please both critics and the general public. Candela. You were labeled as "The new film prodigy" Don't you think that critics were expecting a little bit more? Critics- It was Candela's youth and fresh approach that kept us on track. The results were very positive; and about statistics, that's something that can't be taken lightly. Next question. What are you doing? Having your teatime with the Queen of England? I'm your mother in law. Hey, I was thinking that... maybe next week... Mhmm... ...we could call some friends and go to the farm. Oh, it would be so nice. But you know what Eva's schedule is like I'm trying to help you here, you need to change of scenario, entertain you. Why don't we focus on this and alter that we can think about trips and those thing. Don't get natsy. We have to wait and see. What I would like to talk about... and I know you don't want to talk about this... but I got a call from the web series people Mmm. Yes, Migue, in Spain Yes, Cande, but it's only a few months Sure, only a few months. Mhmm. Don't you think that it sounds great? You and me in Spain having some beers and tapitas. Yes, sounds great; I can't go back to Spain, Migue It's not because of Laura, is it? Laura? How are you? I'm in Bogota! When will we meet? I just moved to a new apartment and I told Eva that we should have a dog... What I'm going to tell her? Sounds great to have some beers in Madrid with Migue, huh? Wake up. How'd it go? Just like last time Why? What happened? I don't want to talk about it. I'm too tired of it. What did they do to you? Nothing. they didn't do anything. - What did they do to you? - It's just... What? What...? Mom Stop it. You're eating them all. You're gonna be fat. Not at all, I'll look healthy, with actual curves. Like a real woman, honey. Oh God. Honey... When are you leaving? I already told you. No you haven't. I told you, in fifteen days counting from this Friday. No.. What? It's getting closer And what does Candela think about it? Think about what? I don't know. Thanks, honey. Honestly, I wouldn't be happy if your dad was the one who spend his time traveling. Coming and going, other country; promotion things, meeting drinks and all that stuff, I wouldn't like it at all. You'll know how to handle it. After all, loneliness is often a bad advisor Mom, she understands. Honey... What? And what does she think about that handsome gringo? Mom... shhh - But he's so hot. - I know. Spectacular. You can believe it? He's so hot. But what can she say? Candela isn't the jealous type. No way. You're gonna be working with him He's really hot. Your competition is increasing, Cusqui. Ah, I can see it Thank god Javier isn't an actor. What where you doing yesterday at that place? It was pretty late. What's your problem? Is there any reason I'm banned here? Javier should have picked you up He's out of the city, Cusqui. You know he's busy. I just can't believe you, Marta. Jackpot slots again? Stop it. If only dad could be here. And there you go with your cheap blackmail. No, I can hear him say "that girl is getting out of our hands". Stop it. I don't want to talk about it. No, and what do you want us to talk about? Your stock market shares? Honey. - Seriously? - What? Chill out. She's a grown up. She knows what she's doing. That's true, Cusqui. Why you have this need to please everyone? And this shit without signal Why are you so stressed? Don't worry, when you leave I'll stop being your pain, and that's for you too. Av, Cusqui Honey, but... I'm sorry, chill out. God, looks like someone was visited by Aunt Flo. Course, it must be. Ay, honey... He's so hands... Honey Morning, Celia. What a great surprise. Hey, Candela. How are you? Great. Didn't sleep much last night? No, work stuff. Sorry, about it, but I didn't know you were coming. Don't you worry. I just came to say hi to my girl, she's going soon and I'm gonna miss her. No, It's just that you look different. You're getting bigger. Bigger. - Are you taking asteroids? - Aste... Asteroids. That'll be the beer, coming. Ok... I think he has to beat off every day. Oh, no No, don't be gross. I think you'll have to apply Migue's method... Beat off? You'll have to I've been beatin' off years ago Cusqui, no. Honey, she has to. I think that's enough for you. Stop drinking honey. Ay, but I'm having fun. Evi, Evi spends her time on a plane like a diva. Such a diva Yes, I imagine her at the dressing room What? Tell us. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, Where's my water? Such a drama queen Are you like that, honey? No. Beer is here. It's 10 each. You have money? Ah, ah. Don't bother you both. Ay, thanks. No, Migue. No, no, no, no, no. I'll pay Let him pay. Let me pay. Just this round. Are you going to pay... No, let me pay this round, please. Evi, he's trying to invite us Let me, I don't like to be invited. Let him do it. What? Everyone here knows that you're making money, but don't show off... What? No, she's not a beer and sausage girl anymore She likes hot dog now. You should have gone. Everyone was there, like In couples. Well, at least the director was totally there for me and he didn't leave me a minute. Hm, of course. Hmm what? Hmm what? You should have gone. The place was full with producers. It would be good for you. Maybe you could have gotten a job. For sure. What's happening? Cande, what's happening? What's the problem here? - The problem? - Yes You know what everyone says about him? No, I don't know what everyone says He has fucked every girl He does? And how do you know that? Bah. Everyone knows it. Everyone knows it. Don't you trust me? Don't you? Don't you? It could be in your DNA? Ah, What's wrong with you? No, that plate it's dirty. Before we start you have to clean it. Well, what I want you to do is make the chocolate stay here making a little curve, then go here and at the end make it land over there. But without touching this strawberry. Okay? I mean, at the end it cannot touch this strawberry. It has to land over here. Well, we'll try it, but it's really hard to force the chocolate to land only in that strawberry. Cande, princess. No, look, the client wants it to be like that; the impact of the chocolate it's always better over strawberries texture. Why don't we use only strawberries then? Princess because this chocolate also goes great with other fruits Peaches, carambolo, soursop... But sometimes it's necessary to sacrifice something to You can't have it all, Don't you think? Ay! Please. Okay, let's see. Let me see if I got it. You want the thread of chocolate to go down over that strawberry, like an "S“, as San Francisco streets... That's right. An "S" Right?, Right? That's the idea. I got you. Maybe you can use a fan to make the effect, princess. Mmm, we don't have a fan, but is not a problem. Okay... At least we can try it. Sure No totally. Mhmm, yes But remember, landing on the strawberry first, Cande. Yes, I got it. Over the strawberry. Exactly. Like San Francisco's street. That's right. You got this. Pretty tense. Right? She's tense.. No, no, no, she's... You know what the problem is? She loves details. Candela. Mu? What are you doing here? Wow, it's been a while. Let me see you. Gorgeous, as always. How are you doing? Fine... What about you? What are you doing here? I got here a couple of months ago, but someone didn't answer my messages. The truth is that I saw it and then I said “I'll answer later... And I completely forgot about it. Yes. 50W'!- Don't be. That happens. I didn't know you were planning to come. I was transferred to a building company. That's great.. It is Great place to escape from the current crisis. Isn't it? Why are you giving me that look? How?... I didn't give you any look. Ay, Laura... Candela... Did the card fail the check again? Or, what was it? Nuh-uh. Then what? Honey, if that bank is giving you nightmares, then you should change it. Don't you think? I don't know If don't like something, you change it. It's not a big deal. When are you coming back? On the 23rd And when's the dinner with the gringo? Which one? You know what I'm talking about. Don't play the fool now. What do you want me to do? Should I stay? What should I do? Because... writing at home, isn't the best way to make money these days. You know? You're becoming your dad Do you know what the problem is? Unlike you I don't get jealous if the chocolate lands on strawberries or peaches No, no, no. I didn't know. I didn't know he would take us to that kind of place. If I had known, I wouldn't have done that and you know it. Not again, seriously, no. I'm not putting that subject back on the table, Cande. I'm not. Because I don't want to, because I'm working, Candela, and you know this makes me nervous. I don't like to be like this. No, this isn't all about me, I know that. Okay then, yes, I'll do it, I'm going back to work, Okay? Let's talk tomorrow. Okay, okay, love you too. What is it? I got the role for the gringo's movie. He's gonna be so in love with you. Everyone falls for me. Yes, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone. Hi... What happened? I think this is awesome. You know... Let's go... going to pay her back by tomorrow. I swear. I'll pay her You shouldn't ask her for money. And you were going to give that money, right? Of course not, but you shouldn't have involved her. What's the big deal. She's being paid very well isn't she? Cusqui, I've said I'm sorry. Don't hate me and try to understand me. You know what, I warned you a thousand times, a thousand. I know that. And how am I supposed to know that he was cheating on me while he was traveling? That motherfucker. No, he's an asshole. He doesn't deserve you and he is not worth all those tears. He's a jerk. Let's go. I'm all alone, Cusqui. I'm all alone. I'm a spinster. 'M, honey. You're 26... What the heck are you talking about? Spinster and cheated. Motherfucker. God. Let's go, Calm down. Cusqui Cusqui Cusqui Titi, stop. It better be the last time you do this to me. I have an early morning tomorrow. You, an early morning? What was it? That's what I get for...

Where did she came from? With whom? Do I know him? Do I know her? No There's no one. My clock was talking. Ticking... Talking, ticking, whatever. Professor Candela. I still can't believe it. Nor X But that's okay. No one knows what tomorrow may bring. How are you? Fine, I'm fine. YOU were a dreamer... Remember that time, If I hadn't stopped you, you would've bought a ticket to, where was it? - Los Angeles. - Yes, Los Angeles. Yes, I know. But, I wasn't thinking, I was crazy, With whose money I was going to go? I was young And you aren't young now? Shit. Silly you... Hey, and there's no hello for me? Ah? How it went? It was good, honey. Good. Are you still mad at me? Are you? No Don't you? How did it go? I forgot it How did it go? How did it go? Stop scaring me. I never ask you. I suck. No, no it's okay.

Don't you think that you should focus in just one thing to be the best one The best one. No. I think that If I want to tell something, the first thing I have to do is fill myself with all kind of experiences. I have to live as much as I can... that way I would know what to tell. Have an obsession. A couple of days ago I read a phrase on Facebook it was something like...

Ay, why you have to act so silly, ah? Guys, in a movie, while you're shooting, you would think that everything's under control, that you have thought about it so many times now. But, when something goes wrong, it might be better if you have thought on plan b. And if the plan b failed, you'll have to wing it; but be careful and don't let that winging screw the entire movie just because you got blinded with something you shouldn't blind yourself. But there's some point that you'll have to take a risk, right? Yes, but... that depends on the risk. That's right, but... a risk is a risk and if you have that on your mind and you know what you want to do, you just jump in, no regrets. Borges used to say... Guys... Eh, I can't say anything now.
