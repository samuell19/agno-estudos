This film is dedicated to all the brave souls - who have fallen victim to a home renovation. SOLAR FILMS & DON FILMS PRESENT SECRET MILITARY EXPLOSION SITE Sir. Sir, wait. You have to understand that your calculations make no sense. Nothing like this has ever been clone before. - Let me see. I don't know who you greased to get this huge an operation. It's my civic duty to stop you. Listen. All I know is that I have to get rid — of the illegal land mines before they're found. And what's the fastest way to get rid of explosives? By blowing them up? No blaster in his right mind would agree to work on a project like this. Time to detonation: 5 minutes. Three minutes! - Three minutes! Remove all vehicles from the site. Time to detonation." 2 minutes. - Can't wait! Boom! You know, one of those garden rocks would be perfect here. Don't you think? THE RENOVATION JALMARI AALTO 1ST PRIZE FOR BEST DRAWING Maija. It's me, Teresa. - Hi, Teresa. How are you? - I'm pregnant with my second set of twins. The baby-making machine is churning. I'm so fertile. Well. What about you? You have many? - Children? No, I don't. No children at all? - No. Oh. But we're going to sail around the world. Maybe. I'm sure you remember Jalmari. - You're still together? I mean... Didn't his children's book project flop? I heard you lost all your savings - and had to move in with Jalmari's mom. THE BROWN PIGGY RETURN TO AUTHOR You got a lot clone today. How's Oili? Has she taken any breaks today? Well, Mom is Mom. A leaf blower? In June? How was your day? - Good. Nice. I bumped into Teresa. You remember her? - Yeah, I do. Can you imagine, she's going to have another set of twins. Honey? Don't worry, okay? This is just temporary. We're saving money. I'm one hundred percent sure my next book will sell. Like crazy. We'll have money again. And we can travel. Right? - Yeah. You just have to believe. Miracles do happen. Why do I feel like they only happen to other people? Maija! Ta-dah. - Oh, honey, you made me breakfast? I thought it might cheer you up. You're covered in flour. - Well... Where's Oili? - She went to get gasoline for the lawn mover. We're alone in the house, and you didn't wake me up? What? - Baby factory. Now? I'm ovulating. - What about breakfast? I'm superhungry. Seriously. Can't we... How about postponing the baby factory inauguration a bit? A bit? Do we look like we have a lot of time to waste? Come! C'mon. No, no. Not in Mom's bedroom. I'm serious. Don't you remember what happened last time? I couldn't stand it again. What is it? - Did you hear that? No. Maija! Someone's here for you! It happened again. I can't believe it. - Do something! Maija! Someone's here for you. Mom, go away. Yoo-hoo? The door was open, and I thought maybe you forgot to... Hello. - Hi. I'm looking for Maija Ojavuo. Okay. I need to talk to you, but no hurry. Please come inside... I mean, please join me in the other room. No, no, no. There must be some misunderstanding. I don't have an aunt named Hulda. - No. But you're Maija Ojavuo. - Yes. And your father is the late Pertti Ojavuo. - Yes. Hulda was your father's aunt, - and she left her entire estate to you. You'll find a list of everything in the folder. Goodbye. - Excuse me. What happened to Hulda? A meteorite. All right then. I inherited everything. - What do you mean? Who was this Hulda? - Hulda Gudrun Faberg. The meteorite story is true. METEORITE KILLS WOMAN Unbelievable. How come we never heard about it? And she was your aunt. - No, my dad's aunt. I must've seen her when I was little, but we lost contact. But according to this, I'm the only heir. What did we inherit? - Hulda's house. Look. This house. Look. It's in Vantaa. - It's a house. For us. Maybe this is a sign. Remember what the fortune-teller said? "You'll be surprised by good fortune." What is it? When you see the house, you'll fall in love with it. You'll want to renovate it, and I'll have to pretend I know how. I know nothing about construction, and I'll fuck up everything. Jalmari! Just think about it. We could renovate it into our dream home. You and I. And maybe a little tiny baby. What about our sailing trip? We both wanted that. I want to go see the house. If it's a piece of shit, we'll sell it. I promise. Well, it's in Vantaa, so... Mom, Maija inherited a house. Good. There'll be more room for the two of us here. The whole thing is a bit tilted. Hey, where are you going? Hey! HERE LIVED HULDA FABERG, HER LIFE ENDED BY A METEOR. This house is lovely! Maija, wait. Look. - Hey, Maija. Wait. There's a lovely little shed here! You sure it's even ours? - Of course it is. C'mon! No... This will make a great studio for you. The wood paneling looks like the paneling at your mom's. Honey. It's in terrible shape. - Picture it fixed. What the hell are you doing there, snooping around? Come out. Both of you. I saw you both. I know you find it exciting when something like that happens. Another person's suffering is social porn for you. How about showing some respect... - Hulda was my aunt. I inherited this house. - What? She was my aunt, and I inherited this house. - Oh. Oh. Well, hello then. - Hello. Folke Seppälä. - Maija. Folke, neighbor. - Hi. This is my house. Take a look at it. It's the nicest house in the area. And it's even bigger inside. We blasted a place for my son underground. He likes it there, but he does come out during the day, though. You're here to check out the house before putting it up for sale? - No. We're actually thinking about renovating it and moving in. Renovating, huh? You mean with dynamite? The house is worth nothing. It's a piece of crap. The property is good, - even though it's rocky and on an incline. Then there's a boggy piece of land in the back. I doubt it can be dried. What do you think is the value of this? Of the house and the property? Not much. Not much at all. If you can convince me, I'll buy it... I mean, if you're selling. It's possible. It would cost something, but not much. A lot of ifs, little money. Why don't I give you my card. Call me if you want to sell. All right. - My condolences. And good luck. Thanks. - Great. Bye! I'm not sure... Let's go. Go ahead, go in. Jalmari! You're my hero. I can't believe this. - I can't, either. It just goes on and on. Jalmari. This is unbelievable. Look at the chandelier. Oh Lord. It's in terrible shape. - Stop sulking. Look at this place! What potential! Maija. This is so... We could put a... - Maija. Honey, I love this. I love it. Jalmari, listen to me for a moment without interrupting. I know it isn't livable, - but when it is, it'll be amazing. I can picture us here. This is our home. Honey, we can't afford to renovate this house. We'll do the work. - This is a mansion. I'm small but fast. You're tall, so we won't need a ladder. We know nothing about renovating. - It can't be that difficult. Remember what everyone said when we started dating? Yeah. That it won't last. Or actually my mom was the only one who said that. All my friends said that. And my family. Everyone thought that. Everyone. We have to prove to them and ourselves that we can do this. Right? Honey. Please, please, please. Please. - Well... Okay. I'm so happy! Guess what? - What? Now we'll go furniture shopping. I want four couches here. We can't go furniture shopping. We need to go to the bank. No, we're going to buy a couch. Give me a kiss. Honey, this'll be so lovely. Maija. - Honey, I'm not in the mood. I can't believe this. - Pull me up! Help! Maija! Jalmari. Jalmari! Are you okay? - No. Yeah, I'm okay. - Guess what, honey? There's a lovely shark-bone parquet here! Yeah, here too. You already started your little renovation, huh? When's the moving truck coming? Not yet, huh? If you really want to fix this dump up, - I know the right person. Architect Pirkka Tyynituuli. Here's his card. He's amazing. I don't think we need one. - And then there's carpenter Mischa. He's the best. And he's cheap. - Oh. He's practically free. He's done work for me. He's a bit eccentric, but he's fast and good. Thanks. We'll think about it. How are you going to finance it all? Do you have income? Sure. We have plenty of income. And we work, of course. This renovation's going to cost a lot. Well, if you want to fix this place up, call Pirkka. If you want to sell it, call me. - Yeah. See you. - Yeah. Bye. How about we just sell? I knew it. You've been thinking that the whole time, haven't you? We could afford the sailing trip. That was our dream. Yeah, I know, but I'm not sure if it's my dream anymore. I'm so attached to this place. Attached? - Yeah. We just walked in. When did you have time to get attached to it? The moment we walked in, I became attached to it. I can sense it and feel it. I can feel it in my body. You don't understand because you're a man. These things have to do with womanhood. Womanhood? - I can sense it and feel it. As a man, I can sense we won't be able to renovate it. You're sensing wrong, honey. - I'm sorry. It's a manly sense. Yeah, but no. We're moving. - Is that so? Yeah. Right? Well, we've checked out - Maija's house. We're going to take a loan from the bank - and renovate the house. I promise we won't bother you with it in any way. A loan from the bank. I see. Who's going to renovate it? You two? - No, no. We have a carpenter. The best. And the cheapest. Jalmari. You've been talking about the sailing trip - so much that my ears hurt. Did you forget about it? - We have a new dream now. I'm talking to my son now. Jalmari. - Yes, mother? Is this your decision, too? Tell Mom. Well, if you straight up ask someone if something is... Or... Of course... It's possible that... But, like... Whether I want to is a question - that needs an answer. - All right. All right? - If you want to live in that dump, go ahead. Thank you, Oili. We'll be fine. Can we live here until our house is ready? Yeah. That went well! All right, honey. - Yeah? This guy is just one option. We'll interview many. Okay? - Okay. So we'll play good cop and bad cop? - Yeah. That'll drive the price down. I'll be the bad cop. Okay? - Okay. Look. Hey... Hello! Pirkka Tyynituuli. Architect. - Maija. And my husband jalmari. Yeah. Listen. Walk with me. - Okay. I don't usually say this. - Yeah? You hit a gold vein. - Oh. Yeah. We'll dry that wall and add a couple of windows. It'll be amazing. We'll build a new ceiling. We'll bring the walls back to life. Yin and yang. One, two, three, four. You can have four couches here. This is amazing. We'll install a smart lighting system. This room is for singing. The handrail is made from one piece of wood. Brown tulipwood. Come. Ooh, Maija. Ooh, what a fabulous space. Maija, do you know what this is? - No. This is a ballroom. Can you feel that people have danced here? Can you? Wow. Maija. This room only needs a bit of paint. Come. Hey... It looks like mold, but it's not. It can be removed. Come, let's continue. Come, Maija. I'd keep the turquoise walls. Come. Ooh. This space is absolutely gorgeous. Wow. Wow. What air. Can you feel it? Give me your hand. Isn't it great? Wow. Maija. Guess why I brought you here? - Why? Because this is where your renovation will start. Here? But downstairs... Guess what you'll have here? - What? Your very own spa. A sanctuary. Maija, do you know what the best part is? - What? The view. Wow. just like home in Switzerland. - Ah. Voilà. Your house will be so special. A natural house with no emissions. We'll only use the purest natural materials. Clay, hay and balsa wood. Clay? This is starting to sound a bit too alternative. No, no, no. Not at all. You see, if we use natural materials, - we're entitled to get support from the Ministry of Environment. Really? You know what's going to be the best thing in your house? What? - The awakening. The way your house will breathe in natural harmony - with your bodies. It's a very intense feeling. It's a bit like... A symbiosis? - Yes! Exactly. A wonderful, perfect symbiosis. - Yeah. Between you and the house. I probably shouldn't say this, but that sounds so lovely. Thank you. I'm not so sure... Well, in any case, - you should remember that I'll take care of everything. You don't have to worry about anything. I'll order the materials. I take care of the workers. I only work with the best. I have a lot of planning to do. I have to get going. Vamos, au revoir! - I can't wait. Thank you! Thank you! I wonder if he heard me. Thank you! Well, that went well. - Yeah. What happened to your bad cop? - I thought Pirkka was lovely. Okay, he might be a bit eccentric. - A bit? He means well. Think about it. We'd have our own architect. We need it. You doubt my skills in finding a good guy? What? What is it? - There's someone here. No, there's not. - Yes, there is. It's a homeless guy. Hello. Mischa, the carpenter. Yes, and also plumber. - Okay. And painter. - Maija Ojavuo and jalmari. Nice to meet you. Is everything okay? No. But no problems. We can fix. - Okay. If we start on the... Monday. So two weeks from now. Okay? - Okay. We need to discuss it. It's okay. Yeah, two weeks, Monday, no problem. Okay, no problems. Yes, good. But do you clean here? You need to clean. - What? For example, you know, this one. You have to take this away. No, no, no. - Yes, you clean everything like this. This is like... Take everything away. This one, you know, away. You have to take this. You take everything away. Shit like this, away. This one away. This one there. Good. Top quality. It's okay. And then next Monday two weeks from now we come here, yes, - to do the work. - Okay. And you give us 75,000 dollars or euros, whatever. What? What? - Yes. And then, remember to clean everything. It's a shit house. You have to take the shit out. Okay? - Yes, yes. Good. Okay? Bye. For example this is shit. You take it out. Everything away. There. RENOVATION STARTS! Here we go, honey. Wait. Wait. - Yeah. Don't stop. - You keep poking me with it. I didn't even stop. Put it down. Lift it up. You kept poking me. - You kept stopping. We have to work faster. YOU'RE OVULATING - TIME TO MAKE BABIES! I can fix this. C'mon. This stays. Maija, c'mon. Jalmari! Where are you going? I'll take the rest of the junk to the dump. We have to be at the bank at noon. You don't have time. We need the loan. - I won't be long. I'll just drop it off there. Honey, did you use masking tape to tie the couch? - Yes, I did. And it won't fall off? - It won't. No, no. Hi. One Minimega Meal and a milkshake. You're in humor mode, huh? Had a couple of drinks at home, and decided to come make fun of me? No, no. Absolutely not. I'm in a bit of a hurry. I have an important loan meeting today. I'm sure you've sorted it out well? - Well, no. But I loaded it today, so it's fresh. I'm just in a bit of a hurry. I don't want to keep you here any longer than necessary. Chemically treated and hazardous materials go to Point 2, - but they must be in type-approved containers. Wood, with the exception of glue- laminated wood, goes to Point 11. Plastic goes to 6. Ceramic waste to 12C. Electrical waste, 17A, next to the cardboard. Paints, solvents and noncombustible canisters to 9. Your turn. - What? You want me to repeat that? Weren't you in a hurry? Plastic goes to 6. Ceramic waste to 12C. Electrical waste, 17A. next to the cardboard. Excuse me. I don't want to be intrusive, but - do you feel more like a woman than a man? I mean, what does your passport say? I mean... Let me guess. Female. - Yes, female. I knew it. Yeah. - At least the last time I checked. So... every now and then, you still have to check? Yeah. I'm sorry. Chaos at the dump. I mean, at the waste collection point. Okay, so you've applied for a renovation loan. Yeah... This looks really good. So... The only question is - how big of a loan do you want? Yep. So we'll get as much money as we want? Well, no. Not a limitless amount of money, but something. 200,000. We need 200,000. 200, ZOO, ZOO... One, two, three. Not a problem. - What? So you'll loan us 200,000 just like that? - Yes. That's what I just said. To be honest with you, - I was expecting you to ask for more. Thank you. - Great. That's all right then. And congratulations on the new center. What center? I'm sorry. Institute. I hope I didn't offend you in any way. The application says... Yes, you wrote "center" here. "Center for Transgender Persons." That's not us. You're not Eero? - What? And you're not Bruno? - No, I'm not Bruno. Not Bruno. Right. That's right. Sorry about the misunderstanding. Let me look at your application a bit. I need to check a few things. All right. Oh my. Oh my. Oh, boy. So, no loan? - Oh yes, you will get a loan. We keep our promises. YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS Yes! Look. I'll show Mom the photo. It's the bank's money. - Still. Think about it. In the old clays, it would've been over a million Finnish marks. We're millionaires. What are you doing? - What? What are you doing? I'm going over the list written by Mischa and Pirkka. The list written by Mischa and Pirkka? Show me. You don't have to. - Show me. Did you buy all of these? You bought an oven, refrigerator... Do you want us to miss all those offers? We have to order them now. You never know how long it'll be before they deliver them. Give me the bank codes, honey. Thanks. 8417847. Done. I wonder if we're nuts. - Yes, we are. But at least we're living and not just dreaming. RENOVATION BEGINS Okay. This is the bathroom. Yes. - Yes. Very important. Yes. - Okay. And you will follow all the regulations, right? You know the regulations? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So, water room norms. Yes, yes, no problems. - Okay. No, no, no. - Okay, good. Then, normal shower here. - Okay. And tropical shower there. Tropical? No problem. Kolya will fix. Top quality. Okay. And double sink there. And a very big mirror there. - Very big, yes. And gray tiles on the floor. - What? Gray tiles on the floor. - Okay. Yes. And then you put toilet on the wall. Okay. Yes. We put it on the floor. Yes, no problem. No, no. You put it hanging on the wall. Wall? - Yes. Put toilet on the wall? Why? It comes... - Shit goes down? Yes, but... - Not through the wall? The shit goes like this, and then it goes down. On the wall. Usually we put the toilet on the floor, not inside the wall. Not inside the wall. No. Outside the wall. Outside? You want the toilet outside? No, I want the toilet inside the house, - but outside the wall. Kolya fix. Top quality. - Yes, Kolya fix. Okay. Yes, no problem. - Thank you. And then, don't forget to put heat inside the floor. - Okay. To get warm floor, okay? - Hot floor. Okay. Yes, yes. No problems. We'll fix you warm floor. Yes. No warm. Hot floor. - Hot floor. Okay. If you want hot floor, you get hot floor. Only for you, my friend. Very hot. Jalmari. jalmari. Yeah? - Be careful with the nail gun. It isn't loaded. You can even do this. You have to press it against wood to make it fire. Kolya. Sorry. I'll put it away. Oh. They delivered them fast. Excuse me. Could you help us carry these inside? Sorry, lunch hour. All right. You can do it! - Oh gosh. Put it down. Okay, that's the last one. -just this one. I don't think... Maija! There we go. Grab it. - Where? I can't... Hey, hey. To the other side. I hurt my back. Help! - How? Help! Help! You ordered hay? - What? What do you need hay for? - We use it for insulation. What? - We use it for insulation! Why the hell would you do that? Just leave it there! Do you want me to leave it here? - Yes! It's going to rain soon, so you should take it inside. This was the last one. What was I thinking? We can't do this. Hey, honey. Together we can do anything. Honey. Darling. Don't you remember? We're gonna prove them all wrong. Are you... Hey. What is it? Hey. Maija. I guess I really am a bit allergic to hay. It looks like your face is getting a bit red. - My face? No way. I've never been allergic to anything. Pharmacy. - What? Pharmacy! - Where? Watch out! I'm feeling a lot better. I don't know about me. I hurt my neck real bad. Have some, honey. They should help. - Okay. Give me some. Put them in my hand. All right. Good. How many should I take? - One a clay. Look. - It's stuck under your... There. How many can I take? - One a day. One? You gave me three. How many did you take? - Six. Six? - Sixty. Sixty? Should we drop by the Poison Information Center? Yeah, we should. What's going on here? Mom? Jalmari. Maija. What happened? And what happened to Dad's car? - Are you selling our things? When you moved out, I had to come up with a way to cover the costs. Without asking us? - You were so busy with your dump. Besides, I'm selling things that you had on loan from me. Like my skis? - I'm sure Daddy and I bought them for you. You can buy them for ten euros. TAKE A FREE COPY OF THE BROWN PIGGY They're having a real party. - Yeah, I can hear. Can't we go... - No. Aren't you hungry? - No. We haven't eaten anything today. What do you want to do then? - I want to go home. It's a construction site. - I don't care. What about the hay? - Immunotherapy. What's going to happen to Mom? - Your mom just sold our things. You could stop defending her. Yes, yes. - Okay. Wait. Hey, wait. Hey! Now! Oh my God! - This can't be happening. Go away, go away. Maija! Maija. Ah, ah, okay. Maija! Fuck! Maija! That was the last of our money. - What are we going to do now? Okay. Who's that? - What? Honey, maybe now is not the right time for that. He's the building inspector. BUILDING INSPECTOR!! I see. Your car is moving. - I see. I suppose that's unfinished. - Yes, we have a plan for it. Yes... And the boiler room? Even an old machine can learn new tricks - when you know what you're doing. So... All right. Where were we? Right. Your house doesn't meet all the rules and regulations, - but I'll temper justice with mercy. You mean the house passed inspection? Well, the list of things that need to be fixed is very long. But I think you can make this livable. Fill out these forms, and everything will be clear. You probably shouldn't... Yes. You'll never make this dump livable. It'll have to be demolished! We're really sorry! - I'll give you two weeks. If everything isn't fixed by then, that's the end of it. Yes, we'll fix it. Two weeks is enough. I have to go to the hospital. - What? I have to go to the hospital. - He said this will be leveled. Leveled? - Leveled. Okay, that I heard. Too bad. I was starting to like the house. Why do things like this always happen to us? Because we're stupid, and it's easy to fool us. Now we're in so much debt - we'll be paying it off for the rest of our lives. And we can't even live in the house. Are you going to give up? Again? - No. I'm just saying how it is. Do you really think we can get everything done in two weeks? We could try to sell- and pay off some of the debt. And move in with your Mom? As always. What does that mean? That everything's my fault? - No. Well... You wanted this house. - Yes, I did. I wanted a home for you and me. I'm so disappointed. We were given yet another opportunity, - and somehow we managed to mess this one up too. And I can't help thinking - that maybe the house isn't the problem. What if we're the problem? You really think so? Maybe. Jalmari! - Mom, who are these people? I took in Syrian families through church. They were looking for a place to stay, and I had room. Let me introduce you. Yes. I have to get some sleep. Okay. Yeah. Maybe later. Jalmari. What... You. Yes, you. Cheers! Cheers to you too! Hey, listen to this. What is it? What is it? - Why don't you tell me. You sleep all day and drink all night. - So what? What about your drawings? You have a deadline coming up. Or is this background research for it, living like a pig? They're illustrations. Mom, how about I take care of my business, - and you take care of yours? What are you doing? You know I wanted you to move back home, but not like this. We broke up. Again? This time it's for real. Why? - Because of the damn house. So sorry for wanting to live like a pig a bit. You know I'm not very good at giving relationship advice. Your dad and I messed around real good. I don't want to... - It was common in those clays. Save me. - You remember I took reflexology courses? I never took one. Damn. Seriously. Is that all? Can I go? Thank you. But your dad always came back. And I always came back home. Because he was waiting for me. Because he loved me. We always forgave each other. Always. Maybe I'm not like my dad. Oili. I heard you could use some help here. You bet. They're washing the windows. They were so dirty. You could hardly see through them. Those boards need to be taken off. Who's that peeking out from around the corner? Hey, kiddo. Come here. I have a lot of work for you. There are paint brushes here. You can go ask those guys what you can do. Good. Book your winter getaway now. Do you want a beach holiday or do you prefer city life? We'll make your dream come true. See you on vacation! Well, well. We'll be at your house... - You bet you will. You realize that we're in deep shit... Wait a minute. How come you're speaking Finnish? What? Dammit. Listen. I had to. I can't find work if I don't do this. At first I was an Estonian carpenter. Then the clients wanted a Polish bricklayer, - so that's what Kolya and I have been doing for a year and a half now. We've gotten pretty good at it, huh? What have you been up to? Looking for a romantic getaway from renovating? No, I'm buying a trip for myself. - I understand. That's what house renovating does to you. You need to take a break. But fortunately you have each other. After all, that's the most important thing in life. What am I doing? Thanks, Mischa. Or whatever your name is. Maija. You left me alone. I was getting ready to go on the trip and - had even taken out a stupid payday advance. Okay. I gotta go. But I realized I don't want to go on the trip without you. I don't want to go anywhere without you. I don't want to go anywhere without you. You can maybe drop those buckets now. I missed you. - I missed you. You've gotten a whole lot of things done. - Yeah. You cleaned up the yard too. I had helpers. - Who? Hey! Come out! Oili. I'm sorry I was so loud. - That's okay. This is our home. You can be as loud as you want. Guess what? I have a surprise for you. You do? What is it? Rosé sparkling wine. - It makes me crazy. I know. - Yeah, I know that you know. That's why we're opening this up now. - Help. We'll be up all night. What was that? Who's there? Don't let me disturb you. What the hell? Pirkka. I was wondering who was making noise. That moaning. I don't believe this. - Don't get me wrong. I didn't come upstairs because of that. Unless you... Out. - Understood. You'll find me in the boiler room if you want me. If you need me. All right. Out. - Yeah. Look this way. Come closer. Good. Look this way. Good. I got dust in my throat. Mom, Kiti inherited a house. - Kiti? Fuck... Do you get the feeling that someone's filming us? We sit on the toilet, and we shit inside the toilet. You're sick people. - What? Okay. No, we are not sick people. We... - Sorry. You're so feminine that you get scared - if you get just a little shit on your hand. I can't do this! You can. - I can. I'm looking for Maija Ojavuo. - Right here. Watch out! What the hell? What's happening? Jalmari! - Right here. I have an easy-peasy day today. I'm pretty normal. - No, you're not. We'll keep the color scheme. Okay, that's too much. What the hell? Why are you speaking in that voice? I want to talk to Maija. I'm sorry. I've had too much to drink. It's morning. - I'm wasted. I have to... It's 9 a.m. Don't breathe my way. I was still in character. - Yeah, right.
