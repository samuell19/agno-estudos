Hold it! Cut it out! You tell me one point that is relevant to us... (STUDENTS CLAMORING) Everybody sign the petition here. Sign the petition here. Hey, Joe! Joe! Joe! You got to go to a meeting tonight. There's a mass meeting, 8:00 near College. Hey, you better go over to the north gate. Got to make sure all the petitions are brought back here. For God's sake, will you just go? Just go! Hey. Hi! Hi! I'll see you back at the apartment, okay? Okay. Hey, William! A minute! Hey, Nora, will you take my place? Wait! You won't believe what's happened. You won't begin to believe what's happened. I can hardly believe it myself. Guess who's coming to the meeting? Sidney Poitier. No, come on. Guess. You'll never get it, not in a million years, but try. Go ahead. I give up. Zinovsky! Zinovsky? Isn't that something? And they said I'd never be able to get him, that I was crazy even to try. He's only in town for three days, but I picked up the phone, and I called his hotel, and there he was. Oh, my God, William. I was so nervous. But I had everything written down in advance so I wouldn't make any mistakes. He was marvelous. Sexy voice. What do you think I should wear? A muzzle. (LAUGHS) Will you come? Where? To the meeting. No. William? No. I thought sure you'd want to meet Zinovsky. I've met Zinovsky. I know I promised not to ask again, but this isn't just another meeting. This is Zinovsky. I don't know what to ask him. I mean in person. You'll be fine. Okay? Okay. You left the window open again. Yeah, I know. Want one? Uh-uh. (SIGHS) (WATER RUNNING) Okay, I'll think about it. Oh, baby, thank you. Thank you. I said I'd think about it. Why don't you warm up the water? I could use a shower myself. I love you. Get in there and warm up that water. Okay. Okay. Melvin, wake up. Wake up. Come on, man. Red alert! I'm cool. That's it. Come on. Hold on. What? Here you go. Come on. That's it. Come on. Come on. Great. You're doing fine. I'm gone. No, no. Over here. Okay. Great. See you later. Take it easy. Yeah. Oh, man, wow. A dream. What a fantastic dream I had. Let me tell you about it. No, Melvin. Oh, man, let me tell you. You'll flip, man. Your ass, Melvin, move it out. I'll swallow my thumb. JANE: What's going on out there? It's Melvin. Goodbye, Melvin. You see. Now, will you please go home? No place to go. Rachel threw me out. All my clothes, too. What took her so long? That's what I kept wondering. I tell you, man, the suspense was driving me crazy. Just listen. Let me tell you about this dream, all right? Just sit down. This dream was like a movie. Titles and everything. Me, Melvin Lasher, and the Statue of Liberty. Isn't that wild? Opening shot, her face. Close-up, my face. I make an opening gambit. She's unimpressed. I make my move. I start at the hem of her gown. Underneath, I can feel her legs. They're enormous, but I keep on going up the length of that great, green body. Soon, I can see her eyes. Those eyes! And they're coming to life! And those breasts. I mean, did you ever really take a good look at that body? She sways, and her crown kind of tips to one side, and she drops her books. Then move for move, pressure for pressure, slowly, inexorably and then uncontrollably, Miss Liberty... And that's when you woke me up. Gee, I'm sorry about that, Melvin. No! I mean, like, you saved me. Dig? And destroyed me all in one beautiful move. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Like you were plugged right in, man. Like yin and yang. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Aunt Ruth. Hello, William. Come in. I was in the neighborhood and I... How you doing, Aunt Ruth? Goodbye, Melvin. Aunt Ruth, your nephew is beautiful. He saved my life. (EXCLAIMS) Keep in touch. My clothes. Beautiful. See you later. Yeah. MELVIN: Beautiful. I hope the car is safe on this street. You wouldn't have any tea, would you? Yes, I think so. Sit down, Aunt Ruth. You wouldn't have anything to go with it, would you? Just some chocolate digestive biscuits. Never mind. They're very good. Sir Francis Chichester, he couldn't have made it without them. I'm exhausted. I've just been to see your grandmother. How is she feeling? She talked about cutting you out of her will. That good. Well, I must admit you fixed this up quite nicely. Very nice indeed. Thank you, Aunt Ruth. Very nice colors. Well, what have you been doing with yourself? You're not still a communist? Milk or lemon? Milk. You know what I mean. What about after graduation? Have you made any plans? No. You have to do something. My draft board will figure something out. Exactly. What about law school? Medical school? Well, you've got to do something. A friend of mine shot off his toe. Be serious. Is that the shower? Mmm-hmm. Aunt Ruth, did you really come here to discuss my future? Yes, I did. William, what about your father? I mean, he's become so inaccessible lately. Since he set up that office in Darien, he won't come into the city at all anymore. He never phones. What does he do with himself? I don't know. He paints. He reads. He gardens. He's happy. When was the last time you saw him? A couple of months ago. Why don't you call him? All right, I will. Good. He must be lonely up there all by himself in that house. Perhaps he'll come into town for dinner. Why don't you drive up to see him? Talk to him. Who would I report back to? You or Grandmother? Thanks a lot. I'm all shriveled up from... Jane, this is my Aunt Ruth. Aunt Ruth, this is Jane Kauffman. Hello. How do you do? Well, I'd better be going. It's late. Never mind the tea, William. And, William, promise me you'll call him. Yes, I promise. Well, goodbye, Miss Kauffman. Goodbye. Goodbye, Aunt Ruth. (LAUGHING) (BOTH LAUGHING) You really are shriveled up. I know. Hey, listen. I won't be able to go to that meeting tonight after all. Okay? Oh! I have to go and see my father. Aunt Ruth really put me down about how long it's been since I've seen him. He gets lonesome up there. Oh, come on. Well, it's been a couple of months since I last saw him. Look, you promised me. I mean, any other night, any other night you could see your father, but tonight... I mean, you promised. I didn't promise anything. I said maybe. Boy, you're something. You really are something. You know, I don't understand you anymore, William. With your toy boats and your... Models. Models! Your toy models. Hey, wait a minute. Jane? Hey! What time will you get back? JANE: I don't know. Meet you here at 10:00. 10:30. Okay. Hey, I love you. Thanks a lot. (BABY CRYING) (ROCK SONG PLAYING ON RADIO) (LOUD CRASH) (TIRES SQUEALING) (INAUDIBLE) (TURNS OFF RADIO) CROMIE: Previous arrests? WILLIAM: What? CROMIE: Ever been arrested? Yes, sir. Date and charges? (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) Last September, disturbing the peace. I was in a march at the UN. And then Chicago, 1968... I didn't mean that. I mean criminal charges. No, I guess not. About drugs, you on anything? No, sir. You ever use anything? No, sir, I don't. Methedrine, speed, bennies? Nothing. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. How about pot? Ever used pot? Not tonight. No, sir. And how about this driver's license? You knew it expired. No, I didn't. It expired eight months ago. Number 3, Hart Hill Road, Darien, Connecticut. You live there? That's my father's address. Do you live there? No, sir. I grew up there. Nice country. Nice homes. You sure you didn't know about this license? Yes, I'm sure. Some people know. They just don't give a damn. How about these parking violations? Twenty-two found in your glove compartment. You know about them? Yeah, I knew about them. Now, this could be trouble. AIS report says "inadequate brakes." No, sir, the brakes took hold right away... I didn't say that. I said "inadequate brakes" and "no appreciable tread on your rear tires." You'd better call your insurance company. They'll want to check it out. I'm not insured. That's another violation. You better make that phone call. (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) What's the matter? She won't be home yet. Who? My girl. I didn't mean her. I meant your lawyer or your father. Your father has a lawyer, hasn't he? Yes, sir, he does. Well, you'd better call him. Right. I called your Uncle Daniel. He was good enough to break away from a dinner party. Don't worry now. We'll have you out of this place in no time. William. Uncle Daniel. How are you? I'm okay. We can talk later. I'm sure you're much too upset right now. An accident like this. It's a very sad thing, very sad. Daniel, how much longer before we can leave? We can go now. The bond's been posted. Everything's been taken care of. Sergeant, thanks for everything. Why in God's name are you barefoot? They got soaked. And your socks? I don't wear socks. Do you own any? Really, Daniel, does that matter? It could to a policeman. You didn't make a very good impression in there, I'll tell you that. I wasn't trying to. All right. Now, the main thing is to keep telling yourself it was an accident. It was. No one is to blame. Did you cry? Shed tears at any time at the accident or since the accident where people might have seen you? No. Did you kneel by the body? No. Well, did you cry out or display any visible grief? No, I don't think so. I can't remember. Well, try to remember. Daniel, is it really all that important? Yes, John, it is. His reaction to what happened is very important. He's been charged with vehicular homicide. The maximum sentence is four years in prison. But that isn't likely. I mean, it won't go that far, do you think? Well, in all likelihood, no, but he has been charged. The district attorney thinks he can get an indictment. The newspapers will jump at it, prominent family and all that. Would it be a good idea to send flowers to the Conroys? Yes, good idea, but we stay away from the Conroy family. Avoid any contact with them. We'll still have the civil suit to consider. Now, take him home with you until this is settled. No, I want to go to my place. Your place? No, you go home with your father. I've got to see Jane. Look, stay away from that girl. In fact, forget about school for the present. If it comes to an indictment, the more shock and remorse you can prove, the better. Believe me, your behavior from here on in will be as much on trial as the details of the accident. Do I make myself clear? Call me tomorrow. I'll have more information. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) JOHN: Right. (GIRLS LAUGHING) Dad, I'd like to tell her myself. Of course. You sure it's not inconvenient, my coming here tonight? I'm sure. I want you to meet her. Can I get you some coffee, Dad? No thanks. Oh, dear. You still have it? It isn't very good, is it? I like it. Well, I've improved since then. Is this the Gipsy Moth? No, it's over there. Where've you been? I need some bread, like now. Melvin, I'd like you to meet my father. Dad, this is Melvin Lasher. Your dad? How do you do? Hey, wait a minute. Sir, you couldn't lay, say, $5, $10 on me, could you? I mean, a handout from a millionaire. Even a dime, a penny? Melvin. It's not the money, man. It's the humiliation. You understand, sir. (DOOR OPENS) Hi. Hi. Dad, this is Jane. How do you do, Jane? How do you do? Melvin, can I see you outside for a minute? Okay, sure. Lasher's function, to be thrown out, right? You see, Mr. Popper, I perform an invaluable social service. Without someone like me to get rid of your serious people would never get down to business. Well, it's been a groove. Perhaps next year in Jerusalem. Perhaps. Hey, he's beautiful. What's up? Come on, outside. What's the matter? (DOOR CLOSES) Excuse me. You have to excuse Melvin. He's really quite brilliant. No, really. I didn't think so either at first, but he is. He was William's friend, and then I got to know him, and we have two classes together. Do you and William have any classes together? Oh! No, no. We met at SNP. Won't you sit down? Students for New Politics... Thank you. ...last year while William was still active. I guess you know all that. Are you still active? Yes. You know, it's funny, but when I first came here I... I wasn't into anything. It was William who hit me to what was happening, I mean, really happening. The war research on campus, the University Development Program. Well, William was into all of that. I mean, really into it, and it made me feel like I had to do something, you know. He made me believe it was possible to change things. God, it was exciting. It still is, of course, but... You think William has changed? I don't know. Well, he's gone. I'd better be going, too. Jane, I'm glad we met. Me, too. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. You get some rest. I like her, Billy. I'm glad. If you and Jane feel like getting away for the weekend, I mean, if you have nothing else planned... Maybe we will. Thanks. Try not to worry. Everything's going to be all right. Good night, Dad. Good night. He's nice. Yeah, he is. What's the matter? I had an accident tonight. I killed somebody with my car. An old lady, she just stepped off the curb, right in front of me, and it was raining. I didn't see her until I was practically on top of her. It all happened so fast. Oh! It was terrible. Senseless. I mean, what the hell was she doing stepping off the curb like that? (PEOPLE SHOUTING) (DOORBELL BUZZES) (DOORBELL BUZZES) Yes? Excuse me, is this the home of Mrs. Verne Conroy? She's dead. Yes, ma'am, I know. I'm William Popper. Are you her daughter? No, I'm her daughter-in-law. She lived with us. You want the daughter? No, ma'am. Would you mind if I came in? Okay. MRS. O'MARA: All right, you get out of here. You just get out of here. You got no right to be here. Go on, get out. You understand? WILLIAM: Yes, ma'am. Just who in God's name do you think you are? Go on, get out! College kids, with your foreign cars and your LSD. You don't know what you do. You don't care who you kill. That's not true. Don't think you can get away with it. You won't. I'm not trying to. There were witnesses. No, ma'am, there weren't any witnesses. Well, we'll find witnesses. (VOICE BREAKING) Don't you worry, we'll find witnesses. Look, Mrs. O'Mara, it was an accident, just an accident. You killed her. Yes, I know, but it wasn't... You know! So that's all. But it wasn't my fault. It wasn't through carelessness. Carelessness, accident, what difference does it make? She's dead now, isn't she? Yes, I know. Besides, an accident is still carelessness. No, ma'am, it isn't. Accidents just happen. Just happen... Well, they're part of living. What, do you think God makes accidents? Well, I don't believe in God, but I believe there are things in which you can't... I'm sorry. (HORN HONKING) An atheist? You told them you're a goddamn atheist? I was trying to explain something. Loudly and clearly, in simple, basic English, I said, "Stay away from the Conroys." He not only ignores advice of counsel, he compounds his stupidity by announcing, in front of a nest of Irish Catholics, (PHONE BUZZING) that he is an atheist. Yes. WOMAN: Your son is here. Ask him to come in. When is he going to see his grandmother? As soon as we leave here. Good. She's been driving me crazy all morning. Sorry I'm late. Cross-town traffic. All right, sit down and listen. Hello, Terence. How are you? Hello, Uncle John. Terence will be handling this in court. Hello, Bill. Hi. Now, then. No jury trial. A judge. Why not a jury? I'll take my chances any day in front of the right judge rather than a bunch of housewives and plumbers. The right judge? I mean, if he appears before Judge Vogel, I can say with some certainty he will not be convicted. If he appears before Judge Morrow, I would say he will. By all means, let's ask for Judge Vogel. It's not that simple, Uncle John. The State determines which judge will hear the case. They toss a coin, Dad. Heads, Judge Vogel, acquittal. Tails, Judge Morrow, conviction. That's an oversimplification. Well, whatever it is. It's the due process of law. Do you own a suit, a shirt and a tie? Yes. You'll wear them in court. The kind of clothes you are wearing are not likely to prepossess a judge in your favor. Do you understand? What about socks? William, listen to me. Keep your mouth shut and listen. I do not know what you are. I can't pretend to begin to understand, but I do know what I am. I am a black Republican lawyer. I know it's fashionable in your set to sneer at me, but when you got in trouble you came straight to the reactionary establishment bastard, me. But that's all right. You're my nephew, and I'll help you, but get one thing straight. In here, you're not on cloud nine. You're not having fun and games at that hotbed of communism you call a college. You're in trouble with the law, with the law, William, and that brings you into my ballpark. There's an indictment against you, so let's understand once and for all we're not at some psychedelic bull session to play intellectual ping-pong with abstract ideas. We're here to save your neck. In my ballpark, you play my game and we play it my way. If you don't, get yourself another lawyer. Do I make myself clear? Answer yes or no. That's not asking too much, Billy. Is it? No. DANIEL: No, what? No, it's not asking too much. It's a reasonable request. (HORN HONKING) (CHILDREN CHEERING) (DOG BARKING) Go on. (CHILDREN CONTINUE SHOUTING) All over the place again last night, Mr. John. All those kids. Did you call the police? Yes, sir. They were here, as usual. Holmes, how's my mother? Your sister's with her. John, is that you? Is William with you? How are you, Mother? Hello, Ruth. My grandson arrested for murder, and no one comes to see me. We were at Daniel's office, Mother. MRS. POPPER: William, where have you been? I left a dozen messages for you to come here. I'm sorry, Grandmother. Sorry, indeed. Did you telephone me? No. What did Daniel say? Who cares what a lawyer said. How are you, Mother? How are you, Grandmother? Will somebody remind William that I can always change my will? Josephine, I assume the silver's polishing itself. No, ma'am. I was just going. Have the groceries arrived? Yes, ma'am. I'll be down presently, just as soon as I'm finished here. You don't still check all the groceries, do you, Mother? I most certainly do. A woman's a fool if she doesn't. If you don't know what goes into your kitchen, you won't know what comes out. Josephine, you are free to leave at any time. (DOGS BARKING) Quiet! Be quiet! There's no one out there. My dogs. I bought them to protect me from those little black hooligans, and last night, they climbed over the fence and messed up my garden again. Could we have some tea? And then what happens? Those idiot dogs attacked the police. I wanted to put an electrically-charged wire around the fence, and they wouldn't let me. Well, you wouldn't want to electrocute somebody. Who said anything about electrocution? A good sharp jolt to keep them away. Tea, Mother? I heard you the first time. Tea is at 4:00. The only thing you think about is food. I'm sorry. Forgive me? Well, if you're going to sulk, you can leave the room. Maybe I will. And if you're going to smoke any of those cigarettes, you smoke them outside in the driveway. Now, then, about that Irish woman he hit. She was probably drunk. Mother, please. Don't "Oh, Mother" me. I know the Irish. They go to bars and drink all day, all night, and then they stagger home blind drunk and throw themselves in front of our automobiles. Surely you don't think that poor woman is to blame for the accident. I most certainly do. You've never understood women, John. They've always been able to fool you. Mother, William's car skidded into her. If she'd been sober and alert, she could have jumped out of the way. JOHN: Well, at any rate, we can't prove she was drunk. No, we can't, and we never will. And you know why? Because not one of you men had the presence of mind to have her blood analyzed. Don't wag your head at me. It's the truth. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to speak with my grandson alone. Remember, tea is at 4:00. Yes, Mother. William. Why do you insist upon coming into my home dressed like a grocery boy? We're ladies and gentlemen here. Yes, Grandmother. I have been sitting here all day, all alone. Well, Aunt Ruth was here. Now, listen to me. You must insist on a post-mortem examination of that woman, and you must insist it be done in front of a Protestant doctor. And don't shake your head at me. I know the Catholics. You're just as foolish as your father. There's not a drop of your grandfather's blood in either of you. You have no sense of responsibility. Look what happened to this neighborhood because people wouldn't stand up to their responsibilities. They all cleared out the minute the Jews moved in. Couldn't they see that the next step after the Jews is the Negro? If they couldn't see it, I could. Well, if you could see it coming, Grandmother, why... Now, I want you to go down to Wingold and Dickinson, 645 Broadway. Ask for Morris Wingold. He's a private detective. All we have to do is find out what bar that Conroy woman was in before the accident. I have no intention of letting that woman walk all over me. Grandmother, Mrs. Conroy is in no position to walk all over you. William, if people like us don't defend ourselves, then the Catholics and the Negroes and the Jews will have the entire country. Some of my best friends are Catholics and Negroes. I know they are. I know you're living with that Jewish girl. Did Mr. Wingold tell you that? You don't even try to deny it. You're disgraceful. (SHOWER RUNNING) When was the last time you wore it? When I was "Clean for Gene" in '68. It's weird. It was a costume then, too, I suppose. The only difference is that then I believed in the role I was playing. Oh, well. How's the tie coming? Well, tomorrow morning you won't be able to tell the difference between me and my cousin Terence, but I guess that's the idea, isn't it? Maybe I won't wear it after all. Oh, come on. No. Maybe I won't. You're hanging up on details. Christ, to think that ridiculous detail might really be important. I have to go into court and play a part in a stupid charade to convince some judge that I'm not really me in order to receive some justice. It's a suit. No, it's not. It's my bid for better treatment because them that has suits gets it and them that don't, don't. All right. All right, don't wear the suit. Right. JUDGE: In addition, defendant was operating his automobile without a valid driver's license. While not contributory, this has bearing on defendant's habitual manner of driving and his attitude towards traffic regulations. This bears on the question of negligence. Further evidence on this point, 22 parking violations found in the defendant's car at the time of the accident. We find a disposition on the part of the defendant to disobey and ignore traffic regulations. This bears on the question of negligence. In cases involving death, the State is not required to prove that some extraordinary or exceptional negligence has taken place. Where even a minor degree of negligence can be shown, the action may be determined as criminal. William Popper, please rise. Your crime is one of the most serious that a person can commit. There's no penalty in criminal or civil jurisprudence that can make just restitution for the loss of a human life. A woman, a mother, grandmother, having spent a lifetime in the service of her children, grandchildren, now ready to reap the rewards of a life so spent, such a woman has been crushed out of her God-given existence. This is the terrible and fearful consequences of a young man who, as testimony has shown, has clearly and repeatedly demonstrated that he is casually irresponsible and consistently contemptuous of the law. William Popper, can you show true cause why judgment should not now be pronounced upon you? No, Your Honor. William Popper, I do find you guilty of criminal negligence in the death of Mrs. Verne Conroy. Therefore, I do now sentence you, William Popper, to one year's imprisonment at hard labor. I'll grant a stay to give the defendant time to arrange his affairs. Bail will be set. The defendant will not leave the city until he surrenders himself to the sheriff of this county Friday morning at 9:00. I'm going to miss you. JANE: What are you thinking? WILLIAM: How nice it is here with you. It would be nice to just stay here with you. Why not? It's just for a week or so. We'd have to go back sometime. Why? (JANE SHRIEKS) (BOTH LAUGHING) I'm gonna miss you. It'll do you good. You'll appreciate me more. Hold still, will you? I want this to be perfect. Come on. Hold it. (SIGHS) There. It should be ready. PRISON GUARD: Cell number two. Watch the gates! MAN: (CHUCKLING) Hi, come on in. You don't mind an upper, do you? Well, sit down and make yourself at home. First time, right? I could tell. The reason I ask is you get a lot of recidivists here. You know what that means? Yes, I do. College man, right? I spotted it right off. Me, too. Plus one year of law school, nights. Moran's the name. James J. Moran. How do you do? William Popper. Now, do you mind if I call you Bill? Good. First names and old shoes, that's me. Well, what do you think of our colors? Psychiatrist's idea. Supposed to keep us from getting depressed. In a way, I suppose it does. Smoke, Bill? No, thanks. I don't smoke. Smart. Very smart. One of these days I'm going to quit myself, just like that, cold turkey. It's the only way. What are you in for, Bill? Of course, if you'd rather not say, I'll understand. I never pry. Vehicular homicide. On appeal? Rather, a certificate of reasonable doubt pending appeal, right? Yeah, that's right. Well, you'll be out in a week. Ten days, two weeks at the most. Would you like a drink, Bill? Yeah, sure. Stand over by the door. If you see the guard, just move away, understand? Okay, Bill. This is what we call yakydok. The guys down in the kitchen ferment it. Cost me five packs of cigarettes. Thank you. Well, here's to Old Glory. Long may she wave o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. (TOASTING IN SPANISH) (COUGHING) It's not a bad prison, as prisons go. No riots, not too much buggering. Still, for people like you and I, Bill... Of course, you'll be getting out right away. Still, on the other hand, as my father used to say, "Treat every experience like a sweetheart. Who knows? "You might wind up having to get married." (LAUGHING) One for the road? No thanks. Come on. No one says no to Senator James J. Moran. State Senator Moran? That's right. I remember reading about you three, four years ago. Yep. We had seven newspapers then. Made the front page of every one, except The Times. Well, l'chaim. (EXHALES) Embezzlement of state funds, that's what they called it, Bill. That's what they called it. But there's two sides to everything, sometimes three, sometimes 23. You know what I mean? Well, it's ancient history. Harkins. Richard Harkins! That name ring a bell? I used my influence to get that man his job, Bill. He owed me a lot. And then he turned State's evidence. Him they only gave two years. Oh! I've done a lot of thinking here in prison, and I've come to the conclusion that you can trace all our problems right back to treachery. Judas, Benedict Arnold, Alger Hiss. Why, if Benedict Arnold hadn't been a traitor, who knows, today we might own Canada. With the back, man, with the back. Don't keep them arms loose. Keep them stiff. Get your back into it. That's more like it. The first day always the worst day. I hope so. Still, it's better than sitting inside doing laundry. How's that? Man, we're out of doors getting all the fresh air, all the exercise. (LAUGHING) Another two or three weeks, you'll see. You'll have muscles like me. (INMATES CHEERING) Hey, Bill, how goes it? Getting the hang of it? Well, I'm doing my best. Good. You got to keep your sense of humor. Humor's important. It's too bad you're not going to be around here for long. We have some interesting types. You'd be surprised. A banker, some corporation executives, top corporations, too. Hi, Bill. Hi, Senator. Hi, George. Sit a spell. Rest your bones. I'm sorry, we can't. There's someone I want you to meet, Bill. No, thanks, Senator. I'll sit here a while. I'm really kind of tired. To each his own. Hurting bad? Huh? Yeah, real bad. Another two weeks you'll be hard as nails. Bill, you good at writing letters? So-so. You ever write any love letters? Yeah, a couple. I'm trying to write one. Sure could use some help. Sure. How's this sound? "I'd like to have you with me all the time." That's fine. And what else can I say, Bill? Well, I don't know. Tell me what she's like. It ain't a she. It's a he. It's my boyfriend. He don't know it yet, but he's gonna be. Little blue-eyed boy works over at the hospital. He's so cute. What else can I say, Bill? Well... "I think of you every minute." Hey, that's good. "I think of you "every minute." (CHUCKLES) Could you say, "You've got the most pretty face I ever saw?" Is that how you say it? No. You'd have to say, "You've got the prettiest face I've ever seen." Hey, give me that again. "You've got the prettiest face I've ever seen." Look, Bill, I'm no prude. You know that. But I feel I just gotta speak up. I hate to see a kid like you from a nice family getting mixed up in... Well, after all, you're only in for a couple of days. Why mess around? Why go out looking for trouble? You know what I mean? No. Okay. Steer clear of George Wilson. Okay? Half the knifings in this prison are about sex. You don't want to be mixed up in things like that. Look, he just asked me to help him with the letter. Well, you don't have to help someone just because he asks. George Wilson happens to be a very nice guy. Have you got a girlfriend, Bill? Have you got a girlfriend? Why? Come on, tell me. Do you? Yeah. Well, that's good. That's very good. Still, a word to the wise. You've only got a few days. Why hang around queers? You know, especially that type? People get ideas, Bill. They talk. The truth is you don't draw the line somewhere, you're going to find yourself mixed up in all kinds of things. After all, it's a prison. You don't believe me. All right. I'll prove it. I'll show you. Look. Look at these. A man wants me to buy them. Can you believe it? Disgusting. What woman would pose for a thing like that? Disgusting. Sure, it's hard on us all not having women around, but, still, sex can be a funny thing, Bill. Thank God I never had any trouble with it, but will someone explain to me what possible kick a man can get from another man? Like I told my eldest, "Just do like I did. "Keep your head up and your fly zipped, and you won't have any trouble." GUARD: Hey, you boys in that shower, if you're finished come on out. Hey, Bill. Hi, George. I got the letter through to the hospital. Ain't that great? Yeah, great. Now I'm gonna get sick in the hospital, so I can see him every day. (LAUGHS) Hey, you, boy. Hi, McArdle. You wrote to him. It was my boy you wrote that stinking letter to. Your boy? Yeah, my boy. Yeah? Now he's gonna be my boy. See that? If you want to play, let's have some room. Come on, man. You bring it, boy! (GRUNTS) (GEORGE GASPING) Guard! Break it up. Move! Move! DANIEL: I've seen the statement you've given the warden in which you refer to the deceased as your "friend." That's right. When you're questioned at the hearing you must avoid that word. No one will assume that a habitual criminal with perverted sexual habits is your friend. Certainly, the prosecution won't bring it out. They'll attempt to present you as a reliable witness. Friends aren't reliable? William, if you want my advice, don't provoke me. Now, then, try to be definite about the attack itself. You'll be questioned closely by the defense. I've been thinking about that, and I don't think McArdle meant to kill George Wilson. Just to scare him. He's not being charged with murder aforethought. But it was more of an accident. George had control of the knife, then he slipped and fell on it. That's just the sort of thing you shouldn't bring out. First of all, it's conjecture. Secondly, you're a prosecution witness. But it should be important. William, your first responsibility is to yourself and your family, not to cause them any more trouble or humiliation. The law will take care of McArdle. You're an impartial observer. Remember that. Besides, he's hardly a man worth helping. It's not a question of helping. It's what happened. McArdle knew George could take him. He must have known that. William, the warden tells me there must have been at least a dozen witnesses to the murder, yet you were the only one noble enough to come forward. Now, why didn't you just keep your mouth shut like the rest of them? My God, I don't know how your father's put up with you all these years. Maybe he likes me. KELLER: Now, then, Popper, what prompted you to help George Wilson write that letter? He needed my help. KELLER: But what prompted you to help him? He asked me to. Why should he ask you? I don't know. We were friends. You got to be friends in just two days? Well, not friends, maybe, but friendly. How friendly? I don't know, just friendly. Just friendly? According to your cellmate, James Moran, you publicly complimented the deceased on his quote, pretty face, unquote. Moran said that? KELLER: Yeah. He heard you. Objection, Your Honor. I fail to see where this line of questioning has any bearing on the issue of murder. Your Honor, I intend to establish that the witness had an emotional involvement with George Wilson, which would bring into question the credibility of his sworn statement. Objection overruled. Proceed. Did you publicly compliment the deceased on his, quote, pretty face? No, I did not. I was helping him write a letter. You were aware that it was a love letter? Yes. To another man? Yes. Are you in the habit of writing love letters to men? No, I'm not. Did you like George Wilson? Yes, I did. Why did you like him? He was nice. Nice to you? Yes. Nice to me. In what way was he nice to you? He was friendly. In what other way? In what specific way? He taught me how to shovel coal. Does that make me a queer? Young man, you will confine yourself to direct answers. Yes, sir. In addition to the fact that he was nice and friendly and that he taught you how to shovel coal, is there any other reason why you liked George Wilson? No. No other reason. In the shower that day, who was the person next to you? George Wilson. Why was he next to you? He was taking a shower. But why next to you? He wanted to tell me something. Then he sought you out. Yes. To confide in you. That's right. Don't you find that strange? No. But I find you strange. I find this whole damn thing very strange. Young man! Look, I'm trying to tell you what I saw, what happened. Young man, you restrain yourself. I don't even think McArdle meant to kill George Wilson. Now, how about that? Isn't that strange? Objection. Sustained. Your Honor, I think the whole thing was an accident. What you think is not germane. The look on McArdle's face when he saw all that blood... That's conjecture. Inadmissible evidence. I'm trying to tell you what happened. Inadmissible! Then what the hell did you bring me here for? (GAVEL BANGS) Young man, that's enough. I intend to examine your record thoroughly before I determine the appropriate punishment for this outburst. This hearing stands in recess until 2:00. (GAVEL BANGS) (SIGHS) You blew it, kid. Thanks a lot, Senator. I'm telling you, Freddy. It's a sure thing. It's a gift. I don't know. They've been holding it back all season to build up the odds. Believe me, today they're gonna let out the throttle. I don't know. Who's the jockey? What does it matter? Excuse me. Excuse me. For what? What's the matter? I have to go to the can. Oh, come on. Who are you kidding? Look, I'm only human. I'm sorry. If you gotta go, go. So, are you in, or what? I don't know. It seems kind of chancy. It's 40-to-1. (LET ME G PLAYING) * Maybe I'll write you a letter * Maybe I'll give you a call * Maybe I'll drop you a line when I'm feeling better * Maybe I won't after all * Somewhere a river is flowing * Rolling on into the sea * Somewhere a flower is growing * That don't mean anything to me * (WHISTLING) (STUDENTS CHATTERING) Where's Jane? You broke out of jail. Yeah. How'd you do it, man? What did you do? Where's Jane? She was called to the dean's office right out of class. Come on, let's go. I am flipping. I am flipping. Do you think she's talking to the press? I don't know. What are you going to do? I don't know. Well, you'll need bread. Here you go, two bucks. Oh, no! What's wrong? I lost your car. I'm sorry. I was at this party. Forget it, Melvin. At least I know the cat. I can go back there. Melvin, forget it. Just drop it. Hey, Bill, you're out. Yeah. Great. See you later. Now, remember! If he contacts you, notify us at once. Either number. If you don't, you're liable to prosecution. You understand? * Let me go, let me go, let me go * Don't give me the answer 'cause I don't want to know * Let my heart go on beating a little bit longer * I'm so young * I'm so young (MELVIN LAUGHING) Beautiful, man, beautiful. I just can't get over it. The window was open, right? You walk right through. Yup. Man, what a prison break you pulled. No grabbing the guard, no carving guns out of soap. The window's open, William Popper walks through it. Beautiful, man. That is the... Beautiful, beautiful. Beautiful. JANE: But why? I don't understand why, you know? In a week you would have been out. I don't know. It was open, I went. Whose car can we use? If you went back, you know, if you explained it all to... I don't want to go back. Jerry Dempsey. I don't wanna go back. Jerry Dempsey's minibus. It's orange. We'll spray it. Melvin, please. What about the appeal? What about that? No, I've blown it. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Blown it. Believe me, he's blown it. Forget about appeal. That's past history. He got out, now he's got to go. They're after him. The police are after him. The fact is you need a car. You need bread, and then out, baby. O-U-T. Someplace. Anyplace. But you gotta go. He's right. (SIGHS) I've got to go. Okay. (DOGS BARKING) (DOGS GROWLING) Holmes, Josephine. Call the police! The dogs are barking. We're being attacked again. (BARKING) MRS. POPPER: They're up on the roof. I can hear them. Get off my roof, you hooligans. The police are coming. You're going to jail. Get off my roof, immediately, right this minute. Grandmother, it's me, William. William, what are you doing out there? Please, let me in. Not until you tell me what you're doing out there. I've escaped from jail. What? Please, let me in. Come in. Come in. Wipe your feet. Thanks. What do you mean you just escaped from jail? Why didn't somebody tell me? Does your father know about this? I don't know. You haven't called him? No. Yes, it's William. We have to hide him. He's just escaped from jail. Go make up the bed in the fallout shelter. No, wait, Josephine. Grandmother, I didn't come here to hide. What did you come here for? Money. I'm leaving the country, tonight. You're what? I'm leaving the country. Ridiculous. Don't just stand around. Go make up the bed in the fallout shelter. No, no. Josephine, don't. Grandmother, I'm leaving tonight. I mean it. That's ridiculous. I won't stand for it. You are my grandson, and you will not leave the country. What would your grandfather do? Would he run away? You will stay here and fight like a man. I don't want to stay and fight. Then you should have stayed in prison. Grandmother... Don't argue with me. This is nonsense. You come with me. Holmes! You, too. Grandmother, the police are after me. Holmes, open the safe. A Popper afraid of the police. I hope you're pleased with yourself. You've disgraced the entire family. Thank you, Holmes. Read this. Read it. It's my will. You see, in addition to the money, I'm leaving you this house. When your great-grandfather built it, it cost $200,000. You couldn't build it now for a million. William, I think this country is in very serious trouble. People like us have to fight to defend ourselves, and it takes courage. But that's what's made us. That's what kept us. I stood by my house, and I want you to stand by things, too. I know. But you can't if you run away. I'm not running away. I'm going away. But that's ridiculous. Where would you go? I don't know. Canada. Canada. You'll freeze to death. Grandmother, I can't wait around. Will you help me? That's all. Yes or no? But what will I do with all this? Who will I leave it to? Your father? That daughter of mine? It's yours. I don't want it. Can you understand that, Grandmother? I don't want it. Look, Grandmother, it's not what you think. I'm not running away from a fight. It's just not that simple. It's crazy, but right now the police are after me and that's crazy. And I need your help. Holmes. Thank you. There's $3,000 in there. I love you, Grandmother. I'll see you to the door, Mr. William. Thank you, Holmes. (CHILDREN SHOUTING) Those damn kids again. MRS. POPPER: Holmes! Yes, ma'am. They're here. Call the police. Well, what are you standing around for? Nobody listens to me, nobody. Holmes, put on the outside lights. (SHOUTING) (DOGS BARKING) Okay. Okay. But just for a couple of minutes. Well, as soon as I can. Right away. Yeah. So long. Here you are. Registration, keys. Not bad for 600 bucks, huh? Terrific. Only 92,000 miles. That's the tires. And don't forget a lube job every 15 months, and the windshield wipers don't work. Come along for the ride? I'm tempted. Popper's law. Always give into temptation. I don't know. It's probably too sane there. Too rational, you know what I mean, man? I mean, what would I do? I'd be lost. And they put butter on roast beef sandwiches. (CHUCKLES) Take care, Melvin. Don't worry about me. Survival of the fittest. Hey, you really are William Popper, high Episcopal, 10th generation. I mean, you're not just some sort of ultimate mind-blowing put on. So long, Melvin. Hey, can I have some of your old dresses? Like, to sell. Take care of the guy. (STARTS ENGINE) Drive carefully. Remember St. Christopher's been busted. I'll make it as quick as I can, okay? Okay. DANIEL: Billy! I'll meet you downstairs. Come on inside. We won't be bothered in here, not this time of the night. I asked them to come, Billy. They're here to help. You're just not thinking, Son. You've got to give yourself up. Look, Dad, I came here to say goodbye to you. Seeing as you're all here, I'll say goodbye to all of you right now. That's it. Wait a minute! You wait just one goddamn minute. You're not going anywhere, understand? I'm not going back to jail. I'm leaving the country. I got into this mess in the first place because something happened by chance, an accident. And everything that's happened to me since then has been just about as absurd. I mean, I'm sorry about Mrs. Conroy, but I don't feel guilty of anything. Now, you listen. Going through that window was wrong. It was crazy, all right. So what? I did it. I followed my instincts. And right now they're the only thing that I can trust. I mean, consider the advice that I've had. How to dress, how to speak. Cool my friends. Keep my mouth shut. Screw the truth. Now, when I get to Canada, I'm going to try and sort this all out, and I'll let you know where I'm at. Because I like to make sense. I like for things to make sense, and right now, here, for me, they don't. So, it's Canada until I can figure things out for myself. That's it. Billy. What'll you do about money? I'm all right. Grandmother gave me $3,000. That can't last forever. Can we send something to him in Canada? I don't need it. Uncle John, he's wanted by the police. Daniel, can we? We'll try to figure out something. But, Dad, he's a fugitive. I've got to go now. So long, Dad. Goodbye, Son. Will you write? Yes, I will. I believe that's for me, Officer. You know what that sign says? Yes, sir. What's it say? "No parking. Loading zone." You'd better believe in signs. It costs money if you don't. Yes, sir. Thank you. Just the fuzz doing its duty. (SIGHS) (VEHICLES HONKING) (SPUTTERING) (HONKING) (ENGINE STALLING) What's the matter? I don't know. It's stalled. What's the matter with it? I don't know. Let's go, you creep! Let's go! Okay, okay. I'm trying. (ENGINE STALLING) Can't you do something? (HONKING) I am. What the hell is happening? Let's go! God damn it! (HORNS BLARING) Come on, Mac, you're blocking traffic. Don't just don't stand there. Move it out. Yes, I know. I'm sorry. (BLOWING WHISTLE) (HORNS BLARING) (ENGINE STALLING) Will you get that thing out of here? I'm trying. Stop trying already. Do it. Push it, man, push it. (BLARING CONTINUES) Push it over there. Get it over to the right! To the right! Okay, you call a tow truck and get this out of here. Yes, sir. And if it's not out in 15 minutes, I'm going to have the Department tow it. You understand? Yes, sir. Right away. Okay. Thank you. (OFFICER BLOWING WHISTLE) Let's get outta here. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Wait here. Come on. What happened? That car you bought us, man. It died. Yeah? Where? Someplace downtown. Come on, we got to go get another one. Yeah, sure. Right. Tonight, Melvin. Right, right. We gotta get out of here. Wait a minute. What if this one dies? Wait a minute, I'm serious. (SHUSHING) Melvin, come on. Okay. No car. What? MELVIN: No car. WILLIAM: Hey! (CAR DOOR CLOSING) Hello! Excuse me. We're looking for a Mr. Smith. Mr. Harrison sent us. He's a friend of Mr. Lasher. We want to fly to Canada. Well, it'll cost. How much? Two passengers? Yes. $1,000. Okay. Now. Okay. You show up here Wednesday morning at 6:00 a.m. Wednesday? We have to go now, tonight. Well, I'm sorry. I got a flight to Mexico first thing in the morning. Canada is on Wednesday. But we have to go tonight. That's the whole idea. Forget it. That is, unless you want to go to Mexico. Does that make any difference to you, Canada or Mexico? When? Couple of hours, more or less. Okay. Still two passengers? Yes. Mexico's another $500. (SIGHS) I think you're going to like Mexico. Hey, where are you going? No, no, no. You stay here. There's a cot and a hotplate over in the corner. Live it up. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, come on, man, I got things to do. You're not my only love affair. Relax, I'm under 30. You can trust me. (DOOR CLOSING) (CAR DRIVING AWAY) Do you want some coffee? Well, like the man said, "What difference does it make?" Canada? Mexico? What if you went back? What could they do? I mean, it's just all so un-thought out. Let's think about it. We could just sit down and think about it. If I went back now, I'd be right back where I was, and that's nowhere. And I don't mean just jail. I mean, there's a nervous breakdown going on out there, and I don't want to be part of it anymore. Not if I don't have to. (SIGHS) I guess in one way or another I've been headed for this for a couple of years, haven't I? (DOOR OPENING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Let's go. (AIRPLANE ENGINE STARTING) SMITH: Come on. Come on. Throw that luggage behind the seat.
