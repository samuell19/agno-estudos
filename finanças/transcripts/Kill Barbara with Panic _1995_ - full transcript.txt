RSG The food has no taste. I don't know... Sometimes I'm seeing things. I light a candle... And the fire... The flames! The end of the world is near, Barbara. Do you know that? What am I going to do? The water's flowing rapidly and I cannot stop it. Barbara, sometimes I wake up at night... And just stare at the moon. I don't know... I don't know what's happening to me. Barbara... Barbara, please come home. You're the only one who can help me, Barbara. Nick is cheating on me! You're the only one who can help me, Barbara. Nick is cheating on me! Come home, Barbara... I need you. Nick is cheating on me! You're the only one who can help me. I need you. Barbara! Hi, Harry. Hi, Mrs. Delaney. Juice, sir? Would you like some refreshments, sir? Excuse me. Sir, would you like some? - Juice, sir? - No, thank you. Sampaguita! Sampaguita! Cigarettes! Alms for the poor. Alms for the poor. Nick, our condolences. Our condolences. Condolences. It's Barbara. We were expecting you yesterday. Can I... Open it. What are your plans... For you and Karen? I don't know... I haven't thought about it. I'll help you sell this house. It's best that you move to a new home. It will help Karen recover from the death of her mother. Nick... Nick, what's wrong with Karen? She's holding back her tears... Her mother just died... It's not normal for a child to- Karen loved her mom very much. Maybe... She just doesn't want us to see her crying. You don't sound like you're concerned. I love Karen, Barbara. But I have to admit... That ever since she was little, she and her mom were very close. I couldn't get into their world... Ruth spoiled her. What about you, Barbara? What are your plans? Are you staying for good? Or did you just come home for the funeral? I have pending work in America... I run a real estate company there. I'll go check on Karen. Karen? Karen? Karen? It's your Aunt Barbara. Why aren't you sleeping yet? Are you afraid of thunder? Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Karen... Mommy... Don't be scared. Mommy... Mommy... Karen... I know how you feel. I love your mom too. And like you, I miss her. You can cry if you want to. There's nothing wrong with that. Sir... Does this go to the bodega? Hm-hm. Aaghh! What's the matter with you?! It's just a painting! Come on! Come on! Arlene? Arlene. You're looking for me? How did you know? I saw you from the window. Uh... Arlene... What are these? Ma'am Ruth was obsessed with Spiritism and Black Arts. She often went to see Mistress Beatrice. That's just some of their paraphernalia. You've been here a long time, Arlene. You saw everything. Maybe you can tell me... Why Karen doesn't have close relations with her dad. Karen doesn't have close relations with anyone except Ma'am Ruth. She's not chummy with me too. It's actually difficult to take care of Karen... Especially after Ma'am Ruth died. How did my sister die? Did you witness it? Just ask Sir Nick about it. I am asking you, Arlene. You love someone else, dont you? Until now you're still in love with somebody else. I don't care who uses your goddamn body! What I want to know is who owns your heart! Who am I competing with in your heart all this time, Nick?! Tell me! Leave me alone. Nick! Nick! Nick, I love you so much! I love you... I love you. I cannot bear to share you with someone else. Just tell me you love me. Ruth, let's talk tomorrow... When you're sober. Who is she?! Who is she?! Is she pretty? Is she good in bed? What does she do for you that I can't? If it's not true that you love another woman, swear it on this cross! Swear it! Open the door! Ruth! Mommy! Open the door! Mommy, open the door! What's wrong with you? Come on! Mommy, please! Let's talk about this! Mommy! Ruth? Ruth! Please open the door! - Mommy, please! - Ruth! Please open the door! Ruth, open the door! A curse on you, Nick! On you and your woman. I will haunt you both in the afterlife! You will pay a high price! First there will be water... And then fire. But the spirits will not allow it. Hold me... Hold me, my child. Ruth, let the doctors treat you. I'm not done with you, Nick. I will come back for you... And your woman. Mommy, don't leave me. Karen... Don't cry... I'm not going to die. Don't be afraid of the dark. No one ever loved us in this world. In the dark heart of fire... I will not be lost. Find me... Find me, my child. Wait for my return. Karen has always been aloof towards her dad. But after that, she grew even more distant. Ma'am... Didn't you feel that? The cold breeze? Arlene, stop it. Ma'am, I'm scared... Ma'am Ruth's ghost could be haunting us... Maybe she doesn't want us talking about what happened to her. There are no ghosts... It's just a product of our imagination when we're scared. Tell Bidoy to replace the bulbs here. The bulbs no longer light up... That's why your imagination is running wild. Ruth? You have to accept the fact that your mom is gone, Karen. That will appease her soul. Do it, if you want to make your mommy happy wherever she is. My mom is not dead. Karen... Do you know... When people die... They go to another place. From there, they can watch over us... And continue to love us. But they'll never be happy... As long as they can see that we're sad. Do you want your mommy to be sad? I don't want mommy to be sad. Do you want her to be happy? Then you have to let go. Pray to God to grant her peace. Will you do that for her? What does she do before she puts you to bed? She sings to me. You can do the same thing... Now that she's been laid to rest. Do you want to sing to her the way she sang to you? Go ahead and sing for her. I once had a dear mother Who loved me tenderly... For when I was a baby She took good care of me... At night as I lay down sleeping My sister by my side... Mom! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Why did you leave me? Mommy! Why did you leave me, mommy? Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Karen! Mommy... Mommy... Mommy... Bidoy... Yes? Did you often drive for Ruth then? I sometimes did. Where did she used to go? Arlene said... She often visited a certain Mistress Beatrice. Ah. Yes. It's in Paco... A place for spiritists. I think they often conducted seances. Seance? That's right. Seance. Nick... Give me the power of attorney for the house... I'll facilitate the sale. It's all up to you. By the way, sorry about last night... I was quite drunk. Miss, don't you have anything with handles? Skateboards are dangerous. Uh... When did you become a drunkard? Ever since I lost you. How did you do it, Barbara? Tell me how. Do what? For more than nine years... You forgot about me. Teach me how to forget about you. It's over between us, Nick. It's been over a long time. You're still the one I love. My sister loved you... She killed herself because of you. I endured a miserable life for you. What happened, Nick? I left my sister in your custody... You promised to take care of her. I endured life with Ruth for nine years. I endured her jealousy and her tantrums... For your sake. The whole time I was forcing myself to love her... It was you I thought of. I tried to carry on with different women... But I still ended up yearning for you. Don't bring up the past, Nick. We can be together now. I ended our relationship a long time ago, Nick. I have a boyfriend in America. You're lying. I will kill you. I will kill you. Karen? Barbara... Karen... I just fixed the telephone. Stay there. What's happening? Wait a second. I'll go check. What's going on? Karen... It's nothing. The car just probably broke down. Stay here. I'll check on them. Let's disconnect the battery. Mommy... Mommy... Mommy... Mistress doesn't do any work anymore. I just want to talk to her. Tell her it's important. I'm Barbara... Ruth's sister. I know. We've seen each other... At the cemetery. I don't believe in ghosts... But I saw Ruth. That's why I'm here. It's possible that Ruth's spirit hasn't crossed the river. When a person commits suicide... It's not the flesh that suffers but the soul. Why did my sister's ghost appear? Sometimes... The hands and feet of corpses are tied together... So that their souls do not roam the earth. I want to talk to my sister. I want to know what she wants. I want to know what will give her peace. Help me. I made the decision a long time ago to quit these practices. It attracted too much supernatural energy... I'm already old. My nerves can no longer handle it. That's why there are times I avoid clients. Isn't that right, Sofia? Yes, Mistress. All right... Just answer this question then- Why did Ruth return? Ruth returned because there's something she wants to know. What does she want to know? The identity of the woman her husband loved. Ruth came to me many times in the past, asking me that question. I told her I don't know... that I couldn't tell from my cards. I lied to her because I didn't want her to attack you... Or to commit suicide. Ruth died without knowing that you're the woman she was looking for. That's not true. My sister is not angry with me. Why did you come here, Barbara? For the truth or for a remedy for your sin? You're a fake! Barbara... Barbara... Don't get mad... I'm just telling you what I'm seeing. I have no control over these things. You don't need to believe me. I don't really care if no one believes me. I've put my days as a soothsayer behind me... Give me your hand! Do you feel any heartbeat? Nothing. You won't find anything in here. I don't have a heart anymore. I've been used up by the people that came to me then. People like Ruth. But now I'm done with all that. Ruth! Ruth! No! Sister! Please! That's enough! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! What's the matter with you?! You're wasting your life! He doesn't want me! Who? He doesn't want me! Who, Ruth? Please help me, sister! Help me! I cannot live without him in my life! Who is this man? It's Nick! It's Nick! What about us? I know my sister. It's just a passing fancy... Like a toy. She wants whatever I want. But when it's already hers, she doesn't want it anymore. What if I just tell her about us? Maybe that would bring her to her senses. No... She might do something harmful. Why are you so concerned about Ruth? I can handle myself... But Ruth can't. She's fragile and impulsive. Something might happen to her... And that's what I'm afraid of. Please, Nick... It's only temporary. Barbara! Are you listening to me? I need to know who the woman in Nick's life is. If I have to dig his heart out just to see who's in there, I would. Please help me, Barbara. I cannot stand it anymore. For two years I endured life with her. I can't go on anymore. I know you still love me. Nick... Nick, you have to leave! You're the only one I love. Nick! Nick, please! Stop it! Fuck you. Fuck you too. Karen... What are you doing here? Why aren't you in bed? I'm talking to Mommy. Your mommy is gone, Karen. Karen... I hate you! Mommy is mad at you. Put that doll down! No! I said put it down! What's wrong with you, Karen? I am still your father! Karen... Karen... Mommy! Mommy! Mommy, come! Mommy, come here. Mommy. Mommy! Mommy, come, let's play. Mommy, come. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Karen? Karen? Karen! Come here! But I'm still playing with Mommy! Karen, your mommy is dead! No! You're a liar! Come on! Don't be so hard-headed! Daddy, no! Daddy, please! Daddy, no! I'm still playing with Mommy. Karen, please! Mommy! You're too stubborn... Arlene! Hurry! It's locked. The other one! - Bidoy! - Nick! Nick! Open the door! Hurry! Bidoy, did you see that? Let's go. Father is going to talk to us. Bidoy, I don't want to go back to that house. Why? What's happening? I'm sorry, Father, for bothering you. Something's happening at home, Father. In you, every dwelling grows into a holy temple. Grant that those who live in this house may be... built up together into the dwelling place of God... In the Holy Spirit, for this we pray. Lord, hear our prayer. You taught your followers to build their houses upon solid ground. Grant that the members of this family may hold fast to your teachings... And be free of all discord; serve you with their whole heart... For this we pray. Lord, hear our prayer. An evil report... He shall not fear. His heart is firm... Trusting in the Lord. His heart is steadfast... He shall not fear... ‘Til he looks down upon his foes. Response. Lord, hear our prayer. I will talk to your daddy... I will take you with me to America, if he will permit it. You will study there. I will take care of you as if you were my own child. You do not have a child. I know. That's why- You will never have a child. Karen? First, there will be fire... And then water. What? The ball of fire will be ablaze like never before! Everyone will burn! It will go after those who sinned! The darkness will swallow them alive! Karen... - Karen, what are you talking about?! - We will all live in the darkness! Karen, please! We're closing down the shop temporarily... We're moving to the province. All of us. We'll stay there for now. Get me my checkbook. I have to settle some payables. Okay. Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Nick? Nick. Nick! Be careful Barbara... You have to be careful. Ruth... She already knows. She'll go after you next. Arlene? Come with me. We're going to see Father. Arlene? What is it? Ma'am, I'm scared. I was hoping... I was hoping that Bidoy and I could go on a leave. You're leaving me and Karen? And now that they're here in the hospital? Ma'am, you don't understand. Arlene... You're letting your fears get the best of you. No, Ma'am. You need to calm down. Ma'am, the reason I'm scared is because I committed a sin. I'm afraid that Ma'am Ruth is after me. What? You see, there was one time when Sir Nick came into my room, drunk. But it happened only once... Just once. Sir Nick was lonely during that time because you left. Barbara... I came here to offer help. I think I have a hand in what's been happening. I was the one who taught the black arts to Ruth. After you left her, Barbara... Ruth took to spiritualism... I brought her to seances and spiritual sessions. I taught her black magic. I was the one who instilled the idea in her mind... That the dead can still go back to the land of the living. A person's spirit roams the earth for nine days. After that... He or she will either ascend to heaven or descend to hell. But... But before the ninth day falls, the spirit becomes more and more powerful... Especially whe the living admit to their sins against the dead person. The sins of the living make the spirits stronger. We should put away lightweight objects... So that we don't get hurt. You said it yourselves- Ruth has the power to move objects. It's better... To be safe than sorry. Since this is... Your first seance... Let me warn you that... No matter what happens... We must not let go of each other's hands. Keep in mind... That you might see things that will frighten you. But you must stay still. If you can't stand it anymore... Just close your eyes... And tighten your grip on the hands you're holding. Sofia... Ready, Mistress. We are calling forth... The troubled spirit that is still roaming... The land of the living. Heed our call, Ruth. Talk to us. Ruth... Heed our call. We wish to make contact. Leave the world of darkness for a while. We are gathered here... Talk to us! Sir! Ruth... We're calling out to you. Heed our call, Ruth. Talk to us! Do you hear our call, Ruth? Talk to us. We're all gathered here! Talk to us! Please! Speak up, Ruth! Talk to us, Ruth! Hold each other's hands. Remember, no one lets go! I know you're here. Ruth, talk to us. Hold tight! Don't let go! Don't let go of her! Don't let go of her! Beatriz! You will pay for what you did to me! You lied to me! You kept the truth from me! Ruth... Forgive me. You will pay! Barbara, you lied to me! You fooled me! No! Ruth... Tell us what we must do to appease your spirit. I won't be appeased until you all pay for your sins! Ruth, forgive us. I love you, Ruth. Find your peace. No! I will drag you to hell with me! No one can escape my wrath! Not even your soul! Arlene! Don't let go! Arlene! We only have one weapon against her... To face her with the use of the strength of our conviction. We must also be able to show her that our intentions are pure. Karen? Karen, no! Don't let go! Karen! Barbara, no! No! Karen? Karen, give that to me. Ruth! Face me instead! Ruth? Is it you? Barbara! You have to be strong. Show her that your intentions are pure. Ruth... Ruth, don't use Karen. Ruth... Give me the knife. I'm asking you... Give it to me. Give it to me. Karen! Fuck you, old woman! You ruined my life! Beatriz... It's over. Mistress! Mistress! Mistress! Mistress! Mistress! Any more comments on those documents, Inspector? I guess you don't have any problem now, Attorney... Since the court has decided... To grant the full custody of Karen to Barbara. Yes. Yes. I was told. Thank you, Inspector. Okay. By the way... When are you coming back? As soon as Karen recovers. Okay. Thank you. Bidoy... Pack all the essentials of Nick. You're in charge here... Lock all the doors and give Attorney a duplicate of the master key. Oh! How you've grown, little girl! Oh, dear! Barbara! - Hi, Nanny. - Hi, Karen. It's been a long time! We're staying here temporarily. That's good. Oh my, such a pretty little girl! You know what? I prepared a feast for you all. These are fresh catch. I'm sure you all missed eating fresh food. Yaya Benita... Why didn't you go to the funeral? I'm sorry about that... I just couldn't stand the thought... Of seeing her inside a coffin. I've been with the girls... Since they were babies. I was their nanny all those years. I love the girls dearly. The smoke's getting into my eyes! I'm getting teary-eyed. Anyway, please take care of this. I'll just set the plates. Kids! Hey! Why isn't anyone touching these fruits? I'm not in the mood anymore. Let me help you, Grandma. Okay, dear. Help yourselves with the fruits. You too, Barbara. Here. I'll just wait for your fish to be ready. It's your specialty, right? You said it. And it's fresh. You know, Nanny Benita... I missed this place. Well, you never visit. Don't forget to buy a lot of vegetables. Take care. Be home before night falls. Yes, Ma'am. Karen... Pease behave. Okay. All right, kids. Don't forget what I told you. Tell your mothers to bring prawns tomorrow. Yes, Grandma. - Do you need anything else, Barbara? - Hurry. Let's go. That will be all. Okay. I'll just clean up and then prepare fresh melon juice. Okay. I'll just rest. All right. Barbara thinks that Ruth's spirit is now appeased... Because of Mistress' death. But she's terribly wrong. It isn't over. Ruth just laid low for a while because of the death of Mistress Beatrice. But while Ruth laid low, she found spirits with dark powers- but no motive at all. Ruth will influence them. They will join forces. They are hard to defeat this time. They are more powerful because it's the eleventh day since Ruth died. They will haunt Barbara. Nanny Benita? Nanny? Nanny Benita! Nanny Benita! Oh! I thought you were inside the room... I heard movement in there. Where are Arlene and Karen? Aren't they with you? No. In that case, they haven't returned. Oh my. I told them to be back early- Because it's dangerous to be out in the water at night! Arlene... Ma'am? Go back to the town center... Nick is arriving. Go fetch him. What? Karen... You stay behind. Karen, my child. What do we do now? My wife is there! Something bad might happen to them. How can I answer your question? We're dealing with a spirit... Humans do not understand spirits. They don't think like us... They don't act like us. Ruth will not stop until she gets what she wants. What does she want? What? Arlene? Karen? Karen? Ruth? What do you want? Deal with me. Don't drag Karen into this. Let's settle this, just the two of us! Fear our God! Nanny! Go ahead! If you don't leave Karen alone, I will kill her! You can't do it, Barbara! I trusted you. My life was a living hell. I confided everything to you. I felt like I was being swallowed up by flames. You were the only one I depended on. But you ruined my trust. You left me with no one to lean on... And that ruined me completely! All you think about is yourself! What about my life? I did everything for you. You've always clung to me, until I could no longer breathe! If we had made one mistake... It was loving you! But as for you, Ruth, you don't know how to love! Your soul grew dark because of your greed! You're even using your own daughter just to get what you want! Auntie? Karen? Karen? Karen? Karen? You have to fight to get rid of Ruth! Do you hear me? Barbara... Don't attempt to save Karen. You think I love her? She's Nick's flesh and blood... And I've cursed that bloodline! I am willing to sacrifice Karen's life... Just to get my revenge! Karen! No! Barbara! Karen! Karen, repeat after me... I believe in God, the Father Almighty... Creator of heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord... Who was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit. Karen? Karen? Karen? Karen? Wake up! Karen! Hurry up! We don't have time! Where are you going, Barbara? There's nowhere else to run. I can find you wherever you go. I am the wind. I am fire. I can even see inside of you. I can see your heart... And the blood running in your veins. And I can see... That you love me. You love me. Don't you, my sister? Come with me, Barbara. It'll just be the two of us... Like before. Barbara... Auntie, don't go with her! Why, Karen? Do you want to come, too? Karen... Move away... Run away from here! Ruth... You know that I love you. Mommy, enough! Stop it, Mommy! Mommy! Mommy, enough! Karen! Why, Karen... Do you think I love you? Karen! Please go! Karen! Arlene! Karen! Daddy? Daddy! Arlene! Daddy! Daddy! Karen! Daddy! Daddy. Daddy, Mommy is taking Auntie with her. This is as far as we go. You and Ruth must face each other once and for all. Leave the child here. Nanny Benita... Where's Nanny Benita? Nanny Benita! This is my world now. You sent me to this place when you turned your back on me. Take a good look, Barbara. I don't want to be alone, sister. Come with me. I'm lonely. Help me, sister. I will help you, Ruth. Feel my heartbeat. I'm still alive, right? I'm still human. Come with me, Barbara. It'll be just the two of us, like before. We're the only ones who ever really loved each other, right? We won't allow anyone to get in between us again. Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! No! Ruth! Leave Barbara alone! Take me instead! Nick! No! Ruth! No matter what I do... I'll never find peace again. Nick!
