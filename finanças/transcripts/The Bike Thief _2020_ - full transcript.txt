Hey. Yep, thank you. See ya. Everything alright? Can you hear me, mate? You okay? You sleepy? Going for a nap? Do you want a pillow? Well, if you can't take it, mate, you better get a new job or something. Boys. One in Angel two in Holloway. Who's taking? -One of us can do it. -He's faster. Do it. Just pick it up. Bro, just, just rush the window. I can't break the window, you smash it. Bro, you are so long your... just... look, pick it up, yeah, please, bro, just throw it through! -Whose car is this? -Bro, it doesn't matter, just do it. Mate, come on. Come on bruv, pick that up, yeah, put it through the window. -Come on, man, please. -Bruv, do it. -I can't. -Bruv, do it. -Oh yeah! -Hey, shut up. -What? -Stop. Stop? Really? Do you want trouble? No trouble. Good. Off you go then. Go away. See you later. Did you smoke? THE BIKE THIEF Morning, duckling! How am I supposed to work with him screaming non-stop? Good morning, grumpy! -I'll put some Palinca in his milk. -Give him to the gypsies. I'm finished. -You haven't finished. Sit down and eat! -I'm full! Easy, easy... You're going to get it! Ready! I'm almost done. Take your time and finish. I'll be back in a minute, yes? Yes? I love you, bye. Will you talk to Yusuf about the heating? -Are you scared? -I'm not scared. Time to go. Talk to him! Funny guy! What? Nothing. Good luck! Can I help you? Yes. Need a lock. What kind of lock? -For my scooter. -Alright, well, this what we got. I don't know. What do you think? Well, expensive means better, right? -But they all work? -I guess. This one looks good. -Thank you. -Good? Yeah. Let me know if you need anything else, yeah? -What? -Are you friends with that boy? Why don't you come and ask him yourself? Flying away? -Bye, ducking. -Bye. Do you have a lot to do? Don't stay up too late. Maybe go talk to mum if you finish before bed... Okay. She'd like that... Sleep well. Thanks. What, you think you can have a go at me? Relax. No one, no one will have me. -Have you heard from dad? -Not yet. Have you got your hot water bottle? -Enough with the phone. -Just a bit longer. Goodnight. Thank you. So, I ride past, and this guy he's just standing there holding his satnav, like a muppet, yeah. Ain't got a clue where he's going, right? Probably heading for a freebie, right? Yeah, but that's not recent though. What? What you're saying is not recent. Yeah, so? So, maybe he was like that before but now the guy's kicking our asses. Just saying. Just saying? Just saying. Three months, three months and we don't know anything about this guy. Who is he? Who are you? One day we have Momo. We knew Momo, everybody loves Momo. The next day, Momo's gone. Momo messed up with Yusuf. He didn't deserve that. Nobody deserves that. -What happened? -Why are you up so early? What happened? -Babies are sleeping. -Tell me. There was a little thing with the bike. It broke down but it's okay. -What? -I took it to the garage. -At four in the morning? -Ya. It's just some guys. What guys? And then Victor gave me a lift home. -Did you smoke? -No. I guess I'm taking the bus? Please. -Miri's old enough to walk. -I have time to walk her. Are you sure? I don't like her walking alone around here. We have enough money to pay rent. How long till the bike's fixed? Tonight... Tonight. What if it's not ready? They will just lend you another? You had me worried... I don't need you to walk with me. I thought it would be nice. We can chat. -About what? -Whatever you want. What is it now? -Dad... -Come here! Dad, what are you doing?! Dad, stop! What did you do? -Yo, get off me man. -Let go of him! Follow me. What's... follow who? Yo, that weren't your car, was it? -Scooter, my bike, where is it my bike? -I ain't touched your bike man. -Dad... please! -You don't understand! What? Miri, is this your dad? Miri... I'd never touch your bike, alright? And that car, I told them to stop, man. You are a... bad person! -Miri! -Leave me! Miri! Miri... Come back! Miri! Come back here right now! Stop! -Leave me alone! -Stop now! No! -Is she yours? -My daughter, this. -Watch her. -I am, I know. Thank you. She could have been killed. -What? -I need your help. I mean, you're sure you didn't just leave it in the... What do I do? This happen before? Nah, not, not with... not with Yusuf. Oh God! Think it was them? -What? -The guys. -What's the... -You heard them. My guy, they're arseholes but they're not evil, they don't want to ruin your life. Not that your life is... is ruined, it's... How do I tell Yusuf? I don't think that's a good idea. He likes you but... How about if you don't tell him? How about if you just find it? You want me to... walk around London and hope I see it? Yes. Can you... lend me the money to buy another one? What, you must have money. You have no family, you... I have a family, they're just not here. How about if you just go to the police? What? Maybe some kids took it, to have some fun, they drive it around, you go to the police, the police are like, "Yeah, here, here it is, here." Look, it's either that or you steal someone else's. I'm joking. Alright. Police. Hey, my guy, it's gonna be alright, yeah? It's gonna be alright. -Victor? -Yeah? What happened to Momo? Don't worry about that now. Yes, sir. How can I help? I want to... my scooter got stolen. Oh dear. Alright. Have you informed your insurance company? -You are insured? -Yes. And you've notified them? -It's not my... -Excuse me? The... it's on... Are you trying to say that the bike is in someone else's name? Yeah. -Who's the owner of the bike concerned? -My boss. Right, so business insurance, I hope you're not in too much trouble. So, you're reporting on behalf of the business. Okay. And your boss has notified his insurance company? I'm here to tell you. Okay, well, I tell you what, you take a seat over there, get that lot filled out and we'll see what's what. How long do you think it will take? It's a... have you found any? It's a black... black... I've given you everything you need to get started, so... Right, then, jumpy? No. Okay. Well, it doesn't look like you've got that far, do you have any ID with you? Yes. Romania? Problem? Purely for the form so we can keep track of all the parties involved. -Parties? -How long have you lived in the UK? I'm here to report the... I'm not asking you anything out of the ordinary, okay? -Okay. -Okay. -We came... -We? -My family. But why... -Is that like a brother or... -My wife. -And what does she do? Why are you asking me this? Maybe you should get your boss down here too. No, that's not, uh... This is stupid. Why don't we find somewhere we can actually hear each other? No, I don't... -Come on, this'll be much easier. -Thank you. -Come on. -Thank you. -What's the problem? -Have a nice day. Elena? Elena? Are you about? Hello? Where are you? Are you alright? No. Awful bloody flu. It's all at... have you done my room? Actually I don't care right now. I just need to lie down. I'm just gonna grab a hot water. It's gone around work like wild fire. I hope I don't give it to you. Total nightmare. What's the matter? Nothing, I... -What is it? -Your room is not ready yet. Oh, it doesn't matter. Actually, would you bring this up for me? -I feel like I'm gonna keel over. -Let me take my things out... Oh, that's fine, Elena. Please the hot water. Elena! Must I add milk? No, no, thank you. When I first arrived I didn't understand. What are these people doing? Now it's normal, pretty much. Assimilation. You know this word? Yes, it's, um, we have the same "asimilare". Ah, see, not so different. How do you find the language? Good. I don't get to practice more than "delivery" and "thank you". Yeah, and the family? -They're fine. Good. My wife... -Elena? Yes, she cleans. She does well. Miri? Fine. -You got the school uniform? -Yes, thank you. How do you like the flat? It's good. We like it. It's cold sometimes. London. Just as long as you take better care of it. But with a cleaner in the family. Why are you here? I wanted to... pay rent. Today? Yes, my wife doesn't like to keep the money in the house. Mine too. Is that it? Also... I, uh, my... wife has a question about the bike. -Your bike, my bike? -Yes. What about it? She wants to know how the insurance for the bike... Your wife wants to know about the insurance for the bike? Yes. What about it? She's a... how do you say, panicked lady. -Nervous? -Yes. Right. And she thinks what happens, I won't, but what happens if I have an accident with the bike? -Have you crashed the bike? -Yes. -And you get hurt? -No, I don't. -Someone else? -No. No one. -Well, what then? -The bike. What happens to the bike if you crash it? Yes. Well, it depends how badly you crash it, doesn't it? Okay. -Have you crashed it? -No, no. No! But if I did? If you did... What happens with the... business insurance? Well, we obviously don't pay for that, so we'd have to work something out. -Work it out? -Yes. -That's kind. -Kind? Working it out. No, I mean we'd have to work out some way of you paying me back. Okay. If it was a little crash, we'd work out something like you making it up with a little chunk of your pay every week. And if it was bigger? As in no more bike? No more bike. I think then, unfortunately we'd have to work out something you and your family would have to find somewhere else to live. -But I could pay you back. -No, you couldn't. Not without the bike. See, no bike, no job. No job, no money. No money, no flat. And you'd owe me a bike. But we are talking hypothetically, right? -Do you understand? -Yes. Good. Get out of here and get some sleep. You look terrible. You didn't touch your tea! Listen to me, I know you have a family. But I have one too. If you come over here and make a mess of things, that's you not me. The same goes for anybody else. If you want to succeed, you have to do it. I won't help you. If you cost me money, you're gone. But you can help yourself, right? Whatever you have to do, do it for your family. Talking hypothetically. You know, with all you guys working, I can't keep track of who has what bike. I don't know the reg plates or even what type you have. I should probably start... maybe tomorrow. See you in four hours. -Hello? -It's me. What's up? Any word on the bike? It's fine. I have kind of bad news. Are you okay? The lady I was working for today, she came home early, found Toma... So what? You know this... I'm not allowed to bring the kid to work. I think she made a complaint. I don't know what we're going to do. Are you picking up Miri? -I'll try. -I thought you said you could? I will! You'll be able to work this evening? Hello? -Got to run. -Did you talk about the heating? I love you. Did you talk... Wait, wait! Thank you. Here we are! So, you're a friend of Michael's? He's helping me with my English. -Michael? -Yes. I had no idea... He is very helpful. -Really? -Yes. -Michael? -Yes. What a good boy! You live over in Falk House... with your family? My wife and children. Your beautiful wife! I see her all the time. She has the most wonderful skin. Yeah. She's a cleaner? Yes. And with that young baby... Yes. If she ever needs someone to look after him, he is a little boy, isn't he? -He is. -I thought so! If she ever needs someone to look after him, I'm always here. Thank you. I will tell her. -Nan, you alright? -Here he is! Michael? Your friend is here from over in the other building. Who's here? -Hello, Michael. -What are you doing? -Bro, I told you, I didn't touch... -I have a question about my lessons. You can't come into my house like this, bro. Be quiet. I just want to talk. -What are you doing? -Quiet! -Hey, this is my home! -Yes? -You are a criminal. -Man, I told you. We were messing about, I mean, I don't know what you think you saw. Shut up! I need your help. Bro. What are we actually going to do? When he stops... He knows. My man, have you done this before? Cause we've never done this before. I need this. Yeah? We don't. I've done it before. I have. -Like we ain't doing that man. -Take it. -No. -Take it! I'm pulling over now. Go do the thing then. Hey man. Aren't you coming? -You go with him. -Who me? Did I stutter? Yeah, but you're coming right? No, you! Give me the keys. What? Help! What's your problem, man? Shit! Why are not you helping?! Come on, man. -Shall we help? -Stay. You too, man! Come on! Oh, no, no, no, I'm not... not me. Stay down! What? Shit, Ollie! Hey, yo, Ollie, set pace man! Watch out, man, watch out! Is he alright? -Bro, my car! -Go! Come on! Fuck! Whoa, what happened? I don't know. Did you go to the police? What did they say? Did you go to Yusuf? What's he gonna do? You... you want a drink? I'll get you a drink. I've gotta go. I'm sorry. You should go to a doctor. Let's go and see Yusuf together, yeah? I can give you a lift. How does that sound? Get the fuck off my bike! Here, boy, give us a hand. Get off me. He's got my bike. You alright? Get the hell off me! Listen to me, he's stolen my bike! Go on, mate, take it, don't worry, we've got him. Get off me! It's my bike!
