[peaceful music] [tense music] [Adolf] Once you've caught the wave, it doesn't matter how you approach it, as long as it's fast and effective. But remember to always lead with the blade. Goofy-footers are an inferior breed. Real surfers lead with their left foot forward. Now, where are the biggest waves in the world found? Waikiki? Waimea Bay. [Adolf] Correct. Who rules the beaches? [Kids] Surfers rule! [Adolf] Who rules the surfers? [Kids] Surf Nazis! Surf Nazis! [suspenseful music] [sirens wailing] [Charles] This is not a test. Repeat, this is not a test. This is an emergency. Keep your radio tuned to this frequency for further details. This is not a test. Repeat, this. This is Charles Moran with the BBS News. The situation here is catastrophic. The earthquake that hit the Greater Los Angeles area just four days ago measured an incredible 8.6 on the Richter scale. It left upwards of 80,000 citizens known to be dead. Countess homeless survivors are being forced to find shelter elsewhere. Police are hopeless. [Leroy] Don't look, Mama. Did ya get the wax made . Yep- They are store pigs all over. Get on. Mengele was in there earlier. Doin' what? Copped a switchblade. Mengele's an asshole, remember that. [suspenseful music] Adolf! Adolf. [tense music] Eva. I'm Nurse Withers, welcome to the Stardust Retirement Home. Ya must be Eleanor. Mrs. Washington to you, honey, and I ain't deaf. Follow me, please. [suspenseful music] Come on! Mengele, I haven't got all fuckin' day. How many times have I told you? You can't rush art. [tense music] Art fart, let's go. It's kinda big, isn't it? Yeah, but it'll make a real nice gash. There, how's it feel? [Charles] The most horrifying side effect of the quake has been meteoric rise of gang-related crime. A certain sick minority is using the suffering to further their own twisted purpose. With the police force stretched beyond its limits keeping law and order in the city, residents of the beach communities are advised not to venture out on. [suspenseful music] Critical areas that divide, largely intact are feeling the effects. There is no protection, there is no police help. A wave of crime is sweeping unchecked in the South Bay. One word describes the state of the beaches, anarchy. This is Charles. Mornin', Mr. Washington. Let you in this gate, sir. [Leroy] What's this I hear about trouble down here. Nazis, sir. [Leroy] Nazis? Surf Nazis. [tense music] Adolf, aw man, we had a great afternoon. Look at this stuff. A whole city block was in ruins, just like one big shopping mall. Aw, it's great. Aw man, I feel so good. I got some drill bits, and we got some, um... Any money? No. What do you mean, man, this is money in the bank. Why don't you have some of the Nazi Youth have a garage sale or something, this is... How are we supposed to live? Man, I just, like, procure this stuff. Like, I don't... Cut down on your rations some. You know, you need to lead more Spartan life anyway. You know, you're beautiful when you're angry, Adolf. Hey Brutus, surf's up! [suspenseful music] Yoo hoo! Yoo hoo, Eleanor. Eleanor, Eleanor? Come in? Hi, your son forgot to give you these, but remember, there is no gambling 'cause it isn't nice. Five card stud, we gonna have some fun. [Charles] We are still receiving reports on how much damage has been... [Woman In Shaw] Nice to have a little sport. [women chuckle] [Charles] Stay tuned to emergency programs... Ooh! Can we have a little fresh air? Gotta put some life in you bitches. [women laughing] I had my bag stolen at the beach. She only put it down for a second and swoosh! Probably one of those beachy gangs. I'll go for a sawbuck. [Charles] Large areas... 10 and raise ya 'IO. Which beach? Power Beach. I am the Fuhrer of the New Beach. [fire crackling] It's well worth taking full control now. I could go for that. [Mengele] Yeah. Shit, Christ! Screw the meeting. Let's just put hole in 'em, huh? I mean, why don't we cut the campfire girl shit? Hook, get up on your feet. Beaches are carrying a lot more than umbrellas these days. Do you leave your valuables at home? There's anarchy out there. Yeah. Very big business. We could make a real killing. And we'll nail the scum the way I say it. Got it, Mengele? Do it quick and we'll do it clean. They won't know what hit them. We'll save your open spleen surgery for parties. So, when's the call? Tomorrow. Eva and I have already sent the invitations. RSVP in blood for all those who don't show. [Eva laughing] [Nazis laughing] [suspenseful music] Glad you could slime in, sewer pipe. [Pipeliner] Where's your faggot boyfriend? He'll be along shortly. [surfer grunts] What's this all about, kraut? Sand. We're not getting the most out of it. I now the coast in my bones, and its potential has never been greater, but we need to work together. My way. Nazi battleships will be patrolling the whole coast soon. Forget about individual colors. Forget about gang territory. We need to centralize power. We need to pull together under the sign of the swastika. Adolf, no! You couldn't handle the power! Anymore heroes? She hasn't been adjusted. I mean, she's not adjusting well. Well, just sedate her like you sedate all the other guests. It's not that easy. Look, you know the system. Valium in her coffee, Percodan in her eggs. She won't drink our coffee, she won't touch our food. She's not even happy with the view from her window. [saw whirring] [tense music] [drill whirring] Art. Try something quieter, drugs maybe. Come here. This is real beauty. Looks perfectly normal. [Mengele laughs] Switchboard. [Kids] Surf to live, live to surf! Surf to live, live to surf! Surf to live, live to surf!

All they understand is force. Freudian psychology, actually. All little boys wanna be charminated. Not all little boys, Mengele. At least I don't have your case of penis envy. [Eva] Come on, vermin, let's go. [tense music] Samurai surfers. Ding 'em up! All right! [Eva] No, no Adolf, no, not here! [ominous electronic music] [Eva panting] Who the hell do you think you are attempting my wave, huh? [men grunting] Ha, motherfucker! Oh. What seems to be the problem. [Samurai] No problem. Come. - Ha ha! - Hey, thanks for the surfboards. [Hook] I knew you weren't shit! Come on, Samurai man! [Mengele] Come back again anytime you wanna get your ass whipped, man! Hey, thanks a lot! [Mengele laughing] You try to have some mercy on these folks here. [Eleanor chuckles] Only the good Lord shows mercy, son. [Leroy chuckles] You too big to kiss your mama goodbye? Goin' swimmin'? Yeah, it was great yesterday. [guests chattering] [tense music] Stop him! He's 90'! My purse! Let me take that from you, little bastard. Give it here. Oh, thank god you were jogging by. You are a wicked little boy. [Kid] Share the gold, bitch. [Adolf] Problem, folks? It's none of your business. My little friend here gets a bit overeager at times. It's the cause, you understand. No, I don't understand it. If the police were here, you wouldn't even be on this... But they're not. Now, run along. [sullen music] Adolf. Leroy. Don't I know you? Why should you? I don't know. You look kind of like a white man I used to know. Except you fell down the chimney. Hey Leroy. Your mama is callin' you, man! [tense music] [Coroner] ls this your son? [Eleanor] Yes. [Coroner] Can I get ya something? No. I just wanna be alone. Why, Jesus? Why? He's all I had left in the world. Please God, tell me who did this. That hook made quite a mess. Of course it did, that's what hooks do. You think there's room in this world for a squeamish conqueror? So fuckin' noble, Brutus. Don't you ever say that again! Listen! It's a do-good beachy. What are you guys fightin' about anyway, huh? Who the hell's gonna miss one goddamn nigger. Now's the time to look ahead, to plot, and remember who our leader is. [Mengele] So, what's our next move, Eva? Shut the fuck up, Mengele. [Mengele laughs] [tense music] [scraping] Mengele! Mengele! I want to talk to you! I said, I wanna talk to you! [Mengele] All you ever wanna do is talk. All you ever wanna do is yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yak, and you never wanna fuckin' listen, man! [Adolf] That's not true! [Mengele] It is true, it is! This whole operation is fallin' apart before you, and then you can't even see it for the pubic hair in your eyes. [Adolf] Shut up! [Mengele] No, where are they, man, I'll prove it to ya! You wear their fuckin' sign! What, god, from where you're pussy whipped! [Adolf] You are created in me. [Mengele] Goddamn straight I am! Do you who Mengele was, man? Do you know? The fucking exterminating angel! [metal clanging] [Mengele screaming] [scraping] He's all I had left. [Woman In Blue Sweater] Such a horrible shock, dear. Just like the quake. Gregory. Take that wetsuit off. No way, Adolf is expecting me. Adolf? Good god, Gregory, is that what that snotty Ricky Johnson calls himself now. Mom. And what are we gonna learn today, Gregory? Don't call me Gregory! How to assassinate your parents? You're not going back to them. They're cool. They're the gnarliest gang around, Mom. Yeah, right. And don't call me Mom! What? It's reverse psychology. I asked Dr. Sniff all about how to deal with you and your nee-Nam crap. You know what he said to me? You know what he said? He said you have suppressed hatred for your father and me. I don't hate you. Oh, yes you do, Gregory. Like, I just wanna live my life my way. Okay, Smegg, I got a flash for you. Go live your life! See ya later. Oh, can I borrow a couple bucks. Oh, god. And don't be late for dinner! [mom sighs] [Charles] Which has been inflicted by the residual aftershocks of the quake. [Adolf] Stinking walking Sly. How goes it? Adolf, how nice. What can I do for you? I need better prices, Sly. [Charles] And the media were... I can't give you better prices. Try. I can't, I'm flat on the floor. I bring you a ton of easily re-sellable merchandise every day. I know it's in demand, Sly. [Charles] I urge the public... I take it from the consumer. [Charles] This is not the... Just offload it faster. [Charles] Time is in traffic, even before... It just doesn't work like that. Then lower bottom end. Why, I was an economics major. Don't fuck with me. [Charles] This is not the end of the world. We'll survive this disaster if we work toward law and order. What do you think, Sly. Oh, it looks good. Thank you. Hey, that's only a buck. That's solid gold, it's 100 bucks! [Charles] Gang-related crime. I'm tellin' ya, we're the hottest gang on the beach. Surfers rule the waves, the Nazis rule the surfers. You're still an asshole, Smegg. Yeah, I like the Pipeliners. Ugh, screw the Pipeliners. They're history. Nobody thinks the Nazis can rule. Well, nah, nah, well, you better believe it. I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't, huh? There was a nigger who tried to stop the Nazi wave. He ain't around no more. Keep talkin' white trash! [dramatic music] Dog fucking bastards! Fuckin' nerve. The slicer, the switchboard, fuck! It's your fault! You dizzy bitch! The beautiful birds are barbecued because you can't stay in one place for five fuckin' minutes. Slime-sucking neanderthal! How dare you question my loyalty? Shut the fuck up, both of you! Fuck! Save that shit for them! Tomorrow, we strike! No one fucks with the Nazis! [surfer groaning] [dramatic music] Larry, Larry! Who did this to you? Larry, Larry, who the hell done this to ya? Nazis! [Mengele laughing] Hey Jesus, where do you think you're goin'? I'm surfin', brother. Nobody surfs here but the Nazis. New orders from Adolf. I don't know any Adolf. Fuck. [surfer screams] Day at the beach, boys! [men grunting] There's no room for Jesus on the New Beach, and it's our final solution, brother. [Eva laughing] [tense music] Good you could make it. Are you kidding? The situation is totally fucking unacceptable. I guess you heard they rumbled Jake and Rabbit yesterday, huh? More bad news, I guess. They're moving in on Power Beach. What? Since when? Since dawn. That's ours, man, that ain't Nazi territory. Oh, that's real bright, Mex. Except you're forgettin' one important thing, man. The quake, the quake changed all that. Adolf plays by a whole new set of rules, hardcore. He plays dirty- Naw, naw, I think it's time that we stop playin' around. [laughing] And fuck somebody up. We need a plan. Trading it in for another one. [Mengele] Aw man, that hook was you. It's a piece of shit. Well, then try this. Oh, that's great. [Mengele laughing] Here. Come here! How's that'? Could try it out. Afternoon, help you, ma'am? We got pipes here, we got tobacco here, all kinda smokin' accessories. We got everything you might want. We got incense burners, we got clay pipes, we got glass pipes, freshly city blends, tobacco. Anything you want ma'am. What can I help you with? I wanna buy a gun. Yes, ma'am. Got this here, ladies' Saturday night special. A ladies' gun? It's small, ma'am. It's easy to carry, perfect for a woman. Well, that's real nice, dear, but I'm more interested in something that'll take the head off a honky at 20 paces! You mean business, don't you, ma'am? I'll be right back. Got this here Walther, P38. That'll take more than his head off, ma'am. It'll take his whole upper body off. I'll take it, how much? Just 129.95. I'll throw in a box of ammunition, ma'am. I'll give ya any set of pipes you want. I'll give you anything want, ma'am, with that. You look like a woman who knows what she wants, ma'am. I can get ya shotguns, I can get ya mace. Hell, I can get ya grenades. Grenades? [tense music] Yo Rats” Seek, little Rats. Hey man, we ain't the Rats no more. [Mengele] Oh really? Yeah. Now, we're the Earth Surfers, riders of the hard wave. Pretty radical, huh? You're still the ears of the New Beach, I hope. [Rat] Sure. Good, any noise? You'll need new t-shirts. [Rat] Something's gonna go down real soon. [sullen music] Goodnight, honey. [door clicks] [Smegg Voiceover] Dear Adolf, there's some gnarly trouble comin' your way. I can't tell ya to your face 'cause I'm afraid you might hurt me, but please be careful. Smegg- - Hold it, Smegg. Where the hell you think you're goin'? Huh? Out to check the midnight swell. Really? Yeah. Really? What's this? I thought we got rid of all this Adolf crap. Huh, huh? Oh geez, Smegg, I've had it with you. Come on, now get it, go on! Jesus. Do I have to put bars on this window? [Smegg sighs] [tense music] Here. Now's not the time. Oh, don't be ridiculous, Brutus. There's never been a better time. When do we proceed? [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [men grunting] [surfer screaming] Shit! Man, Hook came outta nowhere! Thought we fuckin' had him, god! Wait, we'll take him at the bunker. Let's go. [tense music] Let's go tear up the Designer Waves. [suspenseful music] Time to die. Hey! [muffled speaking] [men grunting] [Surfer] Aw shit! [Mengele grunting] Fuckin' A, man! Yeah! [Nazis laughing] [tense music] Ow. Shit. Ow! [Adolf groaning] Ow, take it easy! You know I can't fuckin' understand why the Pipeliners were a no show. I can, they always had the smell of chicken shit on them. I need a beer. Yeah, get me one, would ya? [Adolf] Come on! Ow! [Brutus screaming] I'm sure the acid's done its work, let's go. Go! [Mex] My pleasure. [Pipeliner] Shit, Mex. You're outnumbered now, Nazi, two against one. [Pipeliner gagging] [Pipeliner screaming] [Pipeliner screaming] Sewer Pipe! [Brutus groaning] It's about fuckin' time, Adolf. [Brutus] Adolf! Oh, Adolf! Adolf, I'm blind! [Adolf] You're useless to me now, Brutus. [Brutus screams] [wind howling] What was your worst moment ever, Hook? Probably about the time between when the, the shark got my hand and I got the shark. [Eva laughing] Mengele? Ah, they're all bad, man. [sullen music] We'll bury Brutus in the morning. [shoes clicking] [suspenseful music] [Mengele] Jesus! Go in there! [Mengele groaning] [Mengele groaning] My neck, my neck! [Adolf] Mengele! [Mengele] Goddamn it. [Mengele groaning] [Adolf] Mengele. Mengele. [Eva] Adolf, the bike! [Adolf sobbing] Come on! The bike! It must be one of those bikers. [engine stuttering] Come on, hurry up! [engine revving] [Eleanor laughing] [suspenseful music] Shit. [Nurse Withers yells] [shoes clicking] Eleanor, I demand that you stop this at once. You are upsetting the other guests, and I will not, will not stand for this any longer. Do you understand me? All right, you wanted a showdown between us, old lady, well, you got one. [suspenseful music] Everything I held dear in my life has crumbled to pieces in less than a month. I've been pushed too far. I got nothin' left but payback. You mess with me and you're dead meat, Withers! [Eva] There's the bike! [Adolf] I want that old bitch! I said it and I meant it, I quit! Punk Nazis! You need some Valium, Nursey. [tense music] [engine rumbling] [Adolf] Damn, dead end, let's ditch the bike here. Let's get the hell outta here! [gun bangs] [gun bangs] I know it was you, Adolf! I've been watchin'. You can only push so much. I can only take so much. I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare, ya hear me? Think Adolf. Why do you suppose your little blonde boy quit comin' around? Remember the boy, huh? Remember the grenade? Remember me? Remember my son, Leroy? Think hard, Adolf. All that weird shit that's been happenin' to you lately, I'm the one who's been makin' it happen. [metal bangs] Come on. Show yourself. Come to Mama. I got somethin' for ya. That's right. It's called payback! Come on. You hear me? You hear me in there? [gun banging] Great waves. Hey, dude! Ooh, y'all look a mess. Surf Nazis do this? Yeah. [Eleanor] Which way they go? Fishin' ain't no good and neither are the goddamn hot dogs. What do you say we take the boat out on the harbor, try our luck out there? Today's your lucky day, sucker. [Laughs] You and me are goin' trollin' for some surfers. [engine rumbling] [suspenseful music] [Eva screaming] Oh, hot damn! There he is. [tense music] [man groaning] [gun bangs] [Adolf screams] Gotcha! [Eleanor laughs] [suspenseful music] Taste some of Mama's home cookin', Adolf! [Adolf yelling] [gun bangs] [engine rumbling] [eerie music] [Eleanor laughing] [tense music]
