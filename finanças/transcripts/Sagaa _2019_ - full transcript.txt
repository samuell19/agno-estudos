"Get-up, Get- up, I say..." No Sir, I had asked for 'Chirpy' Chitra's song-book... But they replaced it, ...with the Covers-book! "Instead of studying &amp; ...staying home with family, "You've committed crimes, &amp; ended up here, away from them!" "When you leave from here, ...you're expected to be reformed!" But you keep adding to your crime-list! Go on... Where did you find this? In cell no. 8 There, he's the one. I know nothing of it, Sir. It's not mine... I have no clue, how it got into my cell.

"We keep walking, ...where our feet takes us..." - What now? - Nothing... Keeps laughing like a loose-nut, always! So tell me, ...they tore me bit-by-bit! But, they hauled a Hailstorm on you! What did you do? ...I had a weapon! A 'Weapon'?! So that makes you, ...A bigwig in this Jail? It wasn't mine, though! I'm aware, it was the act of an 'unwanted'. An 'Unwanted' someone...? So... why is 'He' here? Him? Well he... "...thought he'd escape, but was caught!" What is he talking about? Dude, yours was a 'Tragedy'! ...mine's a 'Romance'! - Look at that.... - "Let him speak, will you"! Go on, sire... tell him! All who are in Love... stay 'happily' in love, ...until a Villain enters! Aren't you a Mechanic? Stop going behind, 'Pooja'. So what, if I do...? Pooja, is for me! What's up, Partner... Keeping good? What do you want? You claimed, being in love with 'Pooja'... What are you in Jail, for? "Is this even, fair? You kept claiming 'Pooja' was for you! But now 'Pooja' is definitely, for me! I know about, 'Pooja'! Whatever your 'love' maybe... ...there must be, 'Honesty'! Tell me, '...need sheets to sleep!' &amp; I'm okay with that! What's with this 'Honesty', 'Majesty' etc.,? Me &amp; her are going for a Party, ...this weekend, where I plan to- Get lost! If anything happens to, Pooja! "Is Love just a fire, ...that burns my heart?" "Just like 'God', Whom our eyes don't see!" "For a second, I survived!" "But in the next, I'm dying again!" "I carry all this pain!" "Come, drain this darkness..." "My Lady of Light!" "Pooja, doesn't know about him!" "She is all 'friendly' with him..." "I fear he'd hurt, my Pooja!" - Then... you must go to her! - "Yeah right!" The Superintendent wants you 3. Come-on out.. "Let us go meet him, first! Come on..." "Airaa", He is Jacky... "...is new, here!" One 'Sharp' guy! That 'Load-Lorry' outside, ...its yours, right? Clear it off the road... ...do as Sir says &amp; get back! - Sir, I've told him... - "He keeps yapping!" Tell me, what's the matter? While moving pieces to 'Kolkatta', the Police caught us at the border! Our boys left the 'pieces' there &amp; escaped. What do you mean, ...they escaped - missed etc.,! You're working with, silly boys! If only I was out... I'd be moving 'pieces', every week! Alright, forget it. Our boy is following one, now. If she's picked, 'Baaji' would pay a fine sum! Don't talk it, ...make it happen! Welcome... 'Goodfellas'! You've brought me, great honor! Do not worry... He'd let us off with a warning. What are you looking at? If you're not disciplined now on... Don't stand here, ...just be gone! "That size of him &amp; the stuff he does!" What of us, Sir? We have orders to, Shift you to another jail! Its out of my hands! The order asks us, ...to shift you in 4 days! Here... sign &amp; leave. What are you gaping at? You must've thought well, ...before committing the crime! What can you do, regretting now?! "Sign &amp; leave!" 'Airaa', I can get released anytime... Till then, you must look after things. Do not tell me, ...it was a hit &amp; miss, again! "With the next Piece you pick, ...ask 'Mippu' to follow-carefully!" Why didn't you tell, ...that weapon wasn't yours? It would get Kadhir in trouble, too! Oh really!? "You're not allowed to come here! Get back" Go on! "Like loosing the Mother, who brought us up!" "I can't lose my Sathya, too!" "Your guy takes the blame, ...to avoid the fight, eh?" "You seem happy that, ...we couldn't conduct, 'Singles'?" "In the Singles tomorrow, ...his absence is his defeat!" Look, who it is... Hey 'Jar-Head!' "Since his arrival to the Jail, ...Sathya's been provoking me!" "I've been waiting for it!" The Fight'll happen, whenever he's out! "He will die by my hands!" "We must never fear, ...else we'd fail!" You've placed bets on, Jacky... Would he complete this, Ganga?! Hush! He'd do just fine! What is it? Money? I'm not giving any money... "When awesome-action is about to unfold, You got us playing carom, Ganga!" "Guess who it is?!" Guys, its 'Jar-head'! You dare call me, 'Jar-head'? Bring on the 'Singles', now... - Hey, What are you... - Let it go! Woah, Look at him getting haughty! Sathya isn't shying, away... He just took my place, there! Come on, now! I don't care about, Shifting to another Jail... But Kadhir is my life, you know! We've never been away, ...from each other! You can't be away from Kadhir, &amp; I can't stay here, any longer! This hit, would hurt Sathya! "I walk a lonely-road, ...cos of you lady!" "I've gone completely-crazy, ...cos of you, lady!" "I became a ferrous-fragment, ... cos of you lady!" Even among known places &amp; faces, ...I couldn't manage to do a thing! Next in a new-place with fresh-faces, ...how could I possibly escape? Im only pondering over "Pooja"! "It's a big deal for bike-mechanics like me, ...to have a girl look at us, even!" "But my Pooja, looked at me!" "The happiness, it brought me! Woah!" "I don't fancy, ...splurging with her!" "Just want to express, ...my love &amp; live with her!" "That'll do!" I used to follow her for long, ...worse than a puppy, even! And when I dared to, ...finally face her with a ring, Before I told her of my love, ...the store-owner called the cops! But why? Only the 'love' was mine, ...my gift for her, was his! It's this drive, ...that's brought us this far! Sathya... Kadhir has fallen, unconscious! What? "He's faced Ganga in Singles..." "In his rage against you... Ganga has smashed him!" "As the jail-hospital is ill-equipped, ...they took him to the General Hospital!" - "Hey you, go on now..." - Sir... Sir...please open! ...I need to meet Kadhir! Its nothing, he needed a check-up! I'll open, you wait now. Was this necessary, ..for him to do this? Forget it, he'll be alright. Nobody would question you... Even if they do, You'd hang your head with no reaction! What do we have to fear in this!? A life has been lost! Leave this to me. I shall handle it! We've handled far too-many things, We'll handle this, as well! "Are you even, human?" If this goes up to the Director, ...it would get us all in trouble! Make sure the information isn't leaked, I'll take care of the post-mortem reports! Make sure the Boys don't ...create any trouble for us! Only now you've spoken, ...like a Superintendent! "Rajendran", I must meet with Sathya... How is Kadhir, doing? Have you known Kadhir, ...since childhood? Yes sir! For how many years, ...have you known each other? We never kept 'count' as friends, ...nor did we ever have to! So tell me, how is Kadhir? Is there anyone else, ...to care for Kadhir? What happened to Kadhir? They told us, he'd get better... What happened to Kadhir, Sir? For Kadhir... Kadhir, "The Superintendent wanted to meet you!" "Now on, let's stop the fights Sathya! We'll stay, straighten-up, leave &amp; survive!" We'll take care. I've put a word too! Kadhir is dead! What can we do? You know... Where is Ganga? We don't know, Sathya! Where is that, Ganga? What's with him? Where is, Ganga? Go tell him... Sathya calls Ganga, for 'Singles'! Go... Ganga... has been released, Sathya! "Whose sin, am I suffering?" "My heart inside, is missing!" "Whose sin, am I suffering?" "My heart inside, is missing!" "Your smiling-face, ...from yesterday!" "Has gone missing, So has your body!" "Snapping a finger, Comes with a sound!" "Disputes get dispersed, ...Oh when you come!" "Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, Best-Buddy!" "Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, Best-Buddy!" "Time rolls-on for, Mirage to meet the ocean!" "It even waits, with hope!" "We lost mother's lap!" "But discovered her warmth, ...in our friendship!" "Now I wither, as you rest in peace!" "A 1000 bonds," "...may come &amp; go!" "Nothing lasts, like friendship!" "Even the skies can't suffice!" "I lost my heart &amp; Also my world with it!" "Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy B-U-D-D-Y, Best-Buddy!" "Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy B-U-D-D-Y, Best-Buddy!" "Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy B-U-D-D-Y, Best-Buddy!" "Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy B-U-D-D-Y..." "My Best-Buddy...!" How many years, ...before you're released? I got 2 more years... I got 2&amp;half years. Don't you feel like meeting "Pooja"? What are you doing? Get to work! We've to close the file... Anything about Kadhir's death, ...you'd like to disclose? Tell me, Son... Nope! He used to get this problem often... "Warden"... ...why didn't you tell...? How'd you feel, ...if your Father is killed? ...your Mother? Kadhir was a father &amp; ...a mother to me. When he is killed... What do you think, I'd feel like? What's the point, in telling them? "Ganga", must die! How do we escape? All, have gone to eat. Get it before they return. Go! Come back before the Staff, Quick! Let's go... The only way I've got, ...to reach "Ganga" is, Him! I'm aware of this place, ...been there to repair my bike. What, now? All day in the Workshop, ...he mourns for "Kadhir"! As everyone who worked, ...in the 'Mechanic-Shed' are released... &amp; me, being a 'Mechanic' from before... Could 'we' take it up, now?! Alright, go on! "All of the Jail's rubbish, ...drain's through this!" - What is "Ganga" telling, now? - Satya must... I'll handle that... Where is Ganga, now? We can leave tomorrow, yeah? Else we'd be shifted, ...to another Jail. Fear not, same time Tomorrow... We won't be here! "For me: Ganga must die!" "For Siva: Must meet with Pooja!" "To escape from this Jail, ...this Mechanic-Shed, is all we got!" "Everything below, is ready &amp; cleared. Tonight, we're good to go!" "...had us clear gutters. Atrocious!" "Yes, but we have to!" So... we're leaving tonight, right? Why ask me? What, who else should I ask? We have our reasons to get out. Why does he want to ruin that? It's unfortunate, ...we're caught with him! ...didn't eat, still? Do you know, ...what those 2 are upto? Go &amp; check...Go! "...without me, eh?!" Jacky, would support Ganga, ...if he's out! Reaching Ganga then, ...would be a problem! You'd have to handle both. Give it a thought! So... is what Jacky saying, true? Can't I have dreams too...? What is your problem, pal? Say... why are you losing temper? Anyway, saw the new edition, ...with 'Sunny-Leone' photos, in color! Leave! A man's curse can be very dangerous, &amp; mine is the worst, Mind you! Go on... What's with you, mate... You tickle a trouble &amp; expect silence? I'm dry as a dessert already, ...wondering, who 'Sunny Leone' is!? What's the matter? Scared? That was because, ...you spoke without me. Even if you think of, escaping without me, you'll... Now you know, who "Jacky" is! Every step has been correct, till now! The only problem is, Jacky! If this screws up, I'll...." Why do you get tensed over nothing? Whatever comes, we'll handle it. Let go! He's done for! &amp; no-longer, in our way. Come on, let's go! Thinks he is some 'Sharp-Spark'! "The watch, you found in there..." "- ...who's is it, - Does it matter..." "That explains..." "Come on..." What you checking for? ...think I missed the ring! What do you mean? I jus had it, right here! It was just scrap-wood! ...get one later! - Must've fallen close-by. I'll... - No, No... you get down, I'll go! ...you get down! Why are you here? I lost some money, Sir. Came to check! You checked? Now go... Why did you thrash me, ...that day? Take your hand off! I repeat... "Why did you thrash me?" "Had I not intervened, ...Warden would've foiled our plans!" "Siva getting out, ...felt right for me, then!" "Me &amp; her are going for a Party, ...this weekend. Where I plan to-" "Oh dear..." "I may be caught now..." "But Ganga cannot escape from me!" "...for now I'm happy, ...with Siva escaping!" - This Night 07:55 - Why son? Why would you do this? Why rub him on the wrong side? ...want to be beaten to death? You being here is, ...only for a little longer! Get up now... "We can leave tomorrow, right?" "Fear not, Same time tomorrow, ...we wouldn't be here!" - Did they take it too far? - No... just go! "Why hang your head, then?" "What now? ...thought I would've left?" Why didn't you go? How could I just, ...leave without you? But, you should've... I can't go, ...leaving you behind! "A 1000 bonds," "...may come &amp; go!" Nothing lasts, like 'Friendship'! "Even the Skies can't suffice!" Where's you? You left? "Its raining here, ...next to my Hostel!" Stop sounding silly &amp; get here! "I'll be there..." You got the mechanic-shed's key? I don't have it... While returning, I locked &amp; ...left it in the Warden' room. We're going to be here, ...just for some more time. What do we do now? Whatever happens tonight... We'll get into Warden's room, ...&amp; take that key! "You may have been, ...around this Jail for long!" "But 2 guys are, ...fooling with you here!" Go, check the mechanic-shed... "...you'll know what they've done!" Warden'll be here soon... "Jacky would've surely squealed on us!" Whatever happens, ...we must face it. Understood? Enough of hitting him, He isn't going anywhere! We can hit him later, come on..! Come... "Siva you come, ...we'll leave!" "Just go..." "Damn! They've come already! Siva... run!" "Stop running. Hold it!" "When you're caught, ...you're dead-meat!" "Don't add to your crimes..." "You can't run for long..." "One's down. Get him!" "Watch it... Warden's here!" "Welcome Warden..." "...you see that? They messed his face up!" "Why do you move slowly, They hurt your leg too?" "...must've broken it!" "Guess they ganged up &amp; ...got you hammered!" "His cheek has turned red!" "See him walk, silently!" "How could he... they'd have, mauled his mouth!" "The Jail is soaking in blood!" "His nose seems swollen, specially!" "Is that 'tomato puree' around his mouth?" "Why walk, looking down? ...you lost an eye, eh?" "Guess they put you, ...in your place!" "Is your life, only a riddle?" "Guess he's the new, Frog-face!" "The pride in your walk..." "The punches, you've taken..." "Is it now, in peace?" "Is your heart, hurting as well?" Go on... comment! Everybody... comment! Yeah... spit on me! I won't spare them... I won't... Only he was caught! Isn't opening his mouth, However much we hit him! You keep asking me to, "Tell!" What do you want me to tell? Knowing they were escaping... I too wanted to escape... "See... that arrogance in his reply!" "So... you won't tell!" I fooled you &amp; He fooled me! They'll be, running in circles! I'll get them! "I will get them!" "I will get them!" "I will get them!" "I will get them!" I'll deal with you, ...after I catch them! I'll handle you! - You... put him in the Dark-cell! - Yes Sir! "Wake up, you!" - "Rajendran", get the car! - Yes Sir... "Get going, you!" "Go... He'll join you soon!" Damn! We've to rob clothes, even! Let's sit for sometime &amp; leave. "No, they'd ve started, ...looking for us already!" "We must leave this city, before sunrise!" Come on, lets go. "Even in this age, ...your desire seems insatiable!" - "...of corse! - Every-time, this happens..." - "Your face brightens up! - Fresh-pieces, sizzle-me up!" "Surely it does... I managed to sneak it out!" So... better you 'handle with care!' "Who are you?" What are you doing here? Leave now! "You heard me? Don't just stand there!" "- Get-going... - Come-on..."

"The Party is informed &amp; ...has paid the advance too!" I don't know how/ what you do! "Tomorrow you must, ...return with, the Piece!" Hang up, now! "Put on the lights!" Unless the escapees are caught, ...do not open any cell! No one gets any food/ water! Do not permit bath/ pee breaks! Let them rot inside &amp; die. We're already rotting here! If the doors won't open, ...this Jail would decay! Unfit, to track the escapees... But forbids us from taking a piss! ...think we must part ways, from here! You get to your business, ...and I'll get to mine! Guess... that'll work, for us both! What do you think? Making it this-far, isn't a big deal. ...but your next-stop is! So... watch out! Be in his place, get it done &amp; leave! That must be safe... Here, take it! What's this for? Keep it! Do not steal to gift Pooja, from now! Pay &amp; buy for her...
