- One down, one down. One down, one down, one down. - Hey, buddy. What are you... What are you saying? What are you talking about in here? What's going on, what does that mean? - I don't know what it means. But something bad is gonna happen. Rosie, I don't know. - It's okay, I want to help you, okay? You can talk to me, okay? Mom and dad can't hear us right now. You can tell me. Please, please. - I can't see it, Rosie, I can't see it. I can't see it yet. - You can't see what? Please, please help me. Please. Please. I want to help, okay? I need to know what one down means though, I-- - I don't know what it means, but something bad is going to happen. It's okay, I'm here. Okay? - One down, one down, one down. - Please, please, please, please no. I... One down. - I'm a lucky guy. I met my beautiful partner in crime here pretty early on. Now this girl, the mark, had my eye on her for about six weeks now. Oh, these are the intros, so let's get into it. I am a stuntman here in Los Angeles, and I may be the lead on a new network television series that caters to lonely housewives. Coming to you this fall. - Oh, did you tell them we got married? We got married. - Yes, we did. Ah! Now, I'm not one for labels, but that's what this world seems to be into these days, so you'll have to judge for yourself whether you think I'm a psycho-- - Well, James sure likes to talk a lot, doesn't he? - Now, I didn't know him that well in high school, but I promise you this, he's gonna get to know me real soon. - I didn't fuck your sister, man! - All right, let's just move this thing along. I'm Aaron, and about 10 years ago, someone killed my sister. I'm here to find out who. Now, the interesting thing about me is my gift. Well, I'm of course a DEA agent, but, spoilers. - Oh. Wow. You're so cute when you laugh. - Thank you. - I don't love that they get so drunk when we do this, kinda takes the fun out of it, but, I get that he's nervous, the first time's tough, but... I'm nervous too. I have to tell him I have a bun in the oven. Oh, this is just the intro? Fuck me. Okay, hi, sorry. Hi, I'm Shelby. I am a part-time actress, full-time wife, part time drug dealer, and oh! Pretty soon I'm gonna be a full-time mom! L'chaim. No. Don't look at me like that, it's gonna get a lot worse. Why am I like this? Was I born this way? Is it because my dad used to come into my room every night? - Oh my God, you are depressing. She's so depressing, right? Like, we get it, you were raped, big deal. Got a really good butt though, you know? Oh, shut up, she's my best friend. So is James. They're both fucking crazy. But, you know, I love them. I'd follow them anywhere. Followed them here from Virginia. Did a little bit of acting, wasn't really my thing, and then Shelby introduced me to that guy down there. It's a crazy motherfucker who started convincing me to sell ecstasy to college kids. Oh, he also killed his dad, his cousin, DEA is probably after him, which means that they're probably after me and Shelby too. Oh, and then there's Brad and Leslie who... Jesus Christ, man. - Shit, my bad, bro. - Yeah, it is your fucking bad, fatter guy from LOST. - Aw, bro. Come on. I'll get you another one, it's all good. - Name's not bro, bro. It's Yoni. Yoni. Is that a name? - Anyone ever tell you you look like an extra from a gay porn? - Oh, Yoni to fight again, shocker. - Oh. You fucked up. - Try! - Well, I guess it's time to get things started. - Yes it is. - All right, people. What do we call this thing? - How about the fuckin' crazies? - Hey, watch your languages. - James! - Crazies? That was a remake of another movie, that's not very original. - Yeah, it had that guy from the "Die Hard" movie, he was in the zombie film, right? - Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah, we can't do that. - Guys, just pick something, these poor people. - Zombies can suck a bag of dicks. - Oh, I got it. Cue title card. All right, cool font. Cooler font. Yeah! One down. One down. - So, are you gonna talk, or? - You spoke first. You lose. - Ah, that was a good punch, man. I think you knocked out a tooth. Hey, put that gun away, man. Come on. We're friends here, we don't have to have guns. Look, hey, come here. I get it. You heard about the party, about the drug bust. Look, we didn't have anything to do with that. I sell the shit. All right? I'm not a rat. - Yoni, shut the fuck up. - No, I'm just-- - I don't know anything about your drug deals. Well, I do know about your drug deals, I mean, 'cause I touched you both at the bar last night, and in case you don't know, I have special powers. - Oh. - Ooh! But honestly, I really don't care about your drug deals. - Are you kidding me? - I don't kid. - Okay. Well, stranger. You want to tell us who you are, or what you're doing here? Is it about the raid in Long Beach? - You know, I've never actually been to Long Beach. - So, what? We keep guessing 'til we get it right? I've never done a hostage situation. - Yeah, you know, I've never done a hostage situation either. I only look like a terrorist. - You're not hostages. You leave! You can go at any point, go head. - Well, then, what's the game here, man? I'm pretty sure that somebody sent him. Who sent you, huh? Was it Felipe? Is he free? - Yeah. Yeah, he's free, yeah, he's in the car. He's just sitting out there right now. He's in the car? - Yeah, he's sitting in the car. Really? - Yeah. - Yoni, shut up. Who are you? - Right. Manners. I'm Aaron, and I'm not BS-ing you, Felipe is in the car right now, but I hired him to be in the car. He just has to sit out there. He doesn't know you live here, and... How come neither one of you asked about him? - Oh. - He's breathing, he's fine. - Well, he's gonna be awake in three minutes and 44 seconds. - Aaron, that's mighty specific. - I have a gift. - Your gift. Okay, well, let's just have Felipe come in, we'll square it away. - I told you, this isn't about Felipe and your drug deal. Felipe was on the run, and he needed money, so I said hey, here's some money, go sit in the car. That's the job, he's just-- - Oh my God. It's like talking to a child. Why? - Because, although I said you could leave, I didn't tell you what would happen. Felipe's out there, sitting in the car, and if anyone leaves, he's gonna shot you in the face! Of course, unless I give you permission. - Oh, you're nuts. I love it. - Yeah, I love it. And I'm on a deadline, so we kinda need to speed this up. - You speed it up, man. Get to the point. - It's a real short story, so listen good. One of the three of you killed my sister. And I'm here because I'm gonna find out who. - I don't know who your sister is. - That's good, Yoni, you're right. You don't know who my sister is, but you might've killed her, didn't you? Think back. Fredericksburg, Virginia. High school. Think. Ring a bell? Anyone? Come on. Okay. I'm getting antsy now, and I don't like that. But it's important that I keep my gift honed and crafted, precise. - What gift? - Exactly. You know what, Yoni? You want to fight me? - Uh... What? - Neither one of you are gonna tell me the truth right now. So this is what I'm gonna do right now. I'm gonna beat it out of you. And then, you can go to the cops, admit that you did it, and my parents can move on with their lives, and they can stop thinking that I'm so crazy. - Wait, why do you have a gun? - Well, it was for the guy outside. - Brad? You killed Brad? Shelby. See? I told you, he's with them. - Yoni. Aaron. You seem like a really stand up guy, like someone who really prizes the truth. So let me ask you. How many people have you killed? - Really? - Well, Brad was on his way out anyway, and just one technically, just Brad. It was merciful, though. I mean, I feel like I did the right thing. - I believe you. I do. And I actually believe you're not with the Martinez Cartel. And if you want to kill Yoni... Easy. - Or me... Go ahead. We never knew Rose. - Bingo. - Fuck. - Hello? Shelby, I know you're in there, can you hear me? - What'd you say? - Okay. Hey. It is really hard for me to have a chat with you if you can't hear me. - I don't want to chat with you. I understand that, but your mom thought it might be a really good idea. - Of course she did. She's mother of the year. - Yeah. I need to ask you a very important question, and I need you to be really honest with me, okay? - Fine. - Is your dad abusing you? - What? No. - Okay. Are you telling me the truth? - I love my dad, he's great. - Shelby, I do not feel like you're listening to me. I need you to, I can help you. - I am listening to you. I know you know some weird shit that happens in my family, but my dad isn't abusing me. I'm also a lot smarter than you, bitch. - Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. - You can try to get me to talk about my daddy all day long. But, you're just as fucked as the rest of us. - Why is that? - Come on. That makeup isn't covering up anything. How many times does your husband hit you? - Hold on, Shelby, let me get this straight. So, you think that I'm the one hiding an abusive relationship. You think that I'm covering this up, right? - No, I don't. I think you're using it as a sympathy card. You did that to yourself. Maybe to try to get someone like me to talk to you, open up, feel sympathy for you, and then I'll tell you everything. - Well, Shelby, you are smart. You are really, really smart. Bad makeup job on my part, real bruise. See, I have a power. Two powers, actually. One, I can't feel pain. Can't feel it. Now, I wasn't hit by anyone. Except a tennis ball. - You're such a phony. You think that lying to a little kid is gonna make them want to talk to you. - I'm serious. I'm serious, Shelby. I am not playing games with you, I'm being totally honest. Do you want to hear something crazy? I have to force myself to feel empathy for people's problems. Is that not the weirdest thing for your psychiatrist to say? But it's true. - So, what's your other power then? - Oh, it's a good one. I'm clairvoyant. That means that I can see things before they happen. - You didn't see that tennis ball. - Touche, Shelby. That is one of my gifts that is not fully developed yet. Thanks for pointing that out. Shelby, I see you. I see you. I see you going down a very long path. And you think you're gonna get out of it, but it's gonna end very abruptly for you. - Isn't that how it ends for everyone? I'm not interested in a show, or like, a bunch of models hanging out in a coffee shop for six hours a day. - Okay, okay. Well, what are you interested in? A show where it's just, they have something new every week? Nothing's connected? 'Cause that doesn't make any sense. - It's connected. - Yes, it's not funny. - I do like being new every week. - What do you got, a little rave planned for me tonight? What is this? - Hey, we need to talk. - Oh, shit. What did we forget? I was a little hungover this morning, but I'm pretty sure I remembered to hide the cell phone, and the wallet in the other prat of the canyon, you were on car duty. - It's not about that. - Jesus Christ, why is it so loud in there? I mean, this is a surprise party, I thought it was supposed to be, you know, kind of a surprise, not-- - I do have a surprise. - Oh, and by the way, I know we're off tonight, and I just want to say, thank you again for last night. I know it was my mark, and I didn't do it, but, you know, I'm gonna get there, I promise. And nights like tonight help. Talking it out, just the two of us. - Yeah. The two of us, and now, baby. - Jesus Christ, slow the fuck down! And there are kids in this neighborhood every day. - I have been saying baby, like repeatedly. - Yeah, I'm listening. Jesus Christ, what is going on in there? Happy birthday! - I might've spiked the punch a little bit. - Spiked the punch? Are you kidding me? With these agents and managers we have to impress in there, you thought that was a good idea? - It's just a little ecstasy, babe. - Shelby, we might have the biggest network producer in there for the biggest TV show, and she might be tripping balls? - Very possibly. - And where does Brad add up in all of this? - Brad, he loves it, he's a degenerate. - I don't know what to say. - Okay, don't say anything. Can you listen? Come here. Baby. - No, don't baby me right now. - Not you, you fucking moron! I'm pregnant! - How are you pregnant? - Well, when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much, and they never use protection-- - All right, all right, yeah. - You're mad? - Mad? No I'm not mad. God, come on, I'm gonna be a dad. Come over here. - Oh, daddy, Mr. Culver. - God, I love you so much, baby. And you too, baby. - Oh, no. Don't do that. Don't do that to the child. - Oh, why? Come on. I'm just saying hello to James Jr. here. - Fuck off. - Ow! I think he just kicked. That was his first kick. God, I fucking love you. - What are you doing? Someone's gonna come out. ♪ I know ♪ ♪ Can we get enough ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ Can we get enough ♪ ♪ Can we get enough ♪ ♪ Can we get enough ♪ - We never knew Rose. - Bingo. - Fuck. - Look at you. Alcohol really loosens your tongue. You should drink more. Yoni, get her a drink. - What's happening here? - Shelby, I remember seeing you in a made-for-TV movie. Worst movie I had ever seen in my life, but I haven't really seen many movies. But in it, you had to fight a guy who was twice your size. - Yeah, it was a movie, dipshit. Wait, what's happening? - Yeah. But, I could tell that you had some fight training, didn't you? - Mhm. I can take big guys. Much bigger than you. - I don't doubt that. - The fuck are you guys talking about? - Yoni, will you shut up? I'm trying to talk to Shelby. Shelby, did you know that watches can count your steps now? 6,000 steps today, isn't that crazy? It's gonna skyrocket by tonight. Now, let me put my gun down, and if you guys can get to it, I'm done for. But, if you can't, I'm gonna hurt both of you. James is gonna be up in less than two minutes. Yoni, are you ready to fight? - Why would I fight you, man? - I don't know, maybe because of this. Where are you going? You can't get there. You were so close. Oh, hey, Yoni, peace. A shoe? Are you gonna grab me with it? - What the hell's going on here? - Oh. Hey, James. Look who's awake. - Wow, you ran the school mile in seven minutes? - Yeah, it was a record. - You like to win, don't you? Of course I do. - Well, that's good. It's healthy to want to achieve something, be better and stronger than someone. - How long do we have to talk? Is my mom out there? - Yeah, yeah, she's outside. She just wanted me to talk to you a little bit. Something about a little pet? - Yeah. Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit about your pet? - It was a gerbil. I named it "Gerbil". - That's original. What happened to Gerbil? - He died. How'd he die? - I don't know, he just did. Well, that's not what your mom told me. - What did she say? Does she know? I'm gonna get in trouble. - No, no, James, you won't be in trouble. Whatever you say in here will stay in here. - You promise? - I promise. - I put him in a bag. A plastic bag? - Yeah, like, with a zipper on it, I put him in there. What did you do then? - I closed the zipper. And then what happened? - Gerbil started to move around a lot. And then what happened to Gerbil? - He stopped moving. Why'd you do that to him? - I just wanted to see what would happen. But did you know what would happen? I mean, you're a really bright kid, I'm sure you knew what would happen. - I don't know why I did it, I just did. No, it's okay, it's okay. A lot of kids your age have a fascination with death. Do you plan on hurting other people? - Of course not, I like people. Some people. I'm super popular. - Yeah, I bet you are. Let's talk more about your running. You're really fast, huh? Yeah, I'm really fast. - Okay. How fast can you go? - Both of you, sit down. Move it. There you go. And we're back! Look at us, one big happy family. Now don't move fast, take it easy, I don't want you to go too quick, all right? You're gonna get the spins, and then throw up, and then it's just gross. - Shelby. Who is this guy? - Um, he's a guy from high school. - Hey, Shelby, who am I? Ah! Take that. It's not my size. Okay, James. I want to apologize, okay? I shouldn't of done that to you. I know it was a little strong and a little bit much. I cut it as much as I could, but one tenth of horse tranq, puts you right out. - You shot him when a horse tranquilizer? - Yeah, I know. After three shots of grain alcohol. Not smart, but I mean, right? I'm the bad guy here. - Jesus Christ. Is he gonna be okay? - He'll be fine. - Good to see you too, dickhead. - Oh, yeah. I wouldn't miss your birthday for the world, cockface. - Geez. The mouths on you people. Fuck you! Yeah, what he said. - When'd you get here? - I was here a little while ago, and then bag of sunshine over here clocked me in the face, stuck a fucking needle in your leg. Yeah, I think that pretty much brings us up to speed. - Oh, that sounds fun. - Guys, you are doing great. Just keep talking to him though, get him acclimated, okay? I need you semi-sober for the rest of this. - Acclimated? I feel like dog shit. - Okay, well, I'm a deadline, so how about this. Let's speed the process a little bit, I got something for you guys here. Yeah, that's the one. James? Oh, don't. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Back, back, sit, sit! It's just some adrenaline I picked up from a guy in Mexico. It's fine. - Oh, yeah. I love it. - For now you do. - Now who the fuck are you again? - Aaron. Sit down, Shelby. You're gonna hit me with a shoe? Sit down. I can see it, James. You were gonna put me up against that wall, and while my back was turned, you were gonna grab the gun. I see it all. I just need you evened out, I'm gonna talk. Is that okay? And Shelby, don't you give me those dead eyes. You are not a saint. - Where's Brad? - All right, Brad is dead, but it's not an important conversation right now. There are bigger things. - What the fuck? - Seriously, just take the shot. - No, Jesus, I can't get that fucked up tonight. - I'm sure you've done worse than this. - What? What are you talking about? - What? What the fuck, man? You've done this before. - Yeah, I've taken shots of vodka, not grain alcohol. - Oh, I forgot you're the birthday pussy. - Okay. For the role, okay? No more driving into walls, and no more jumping out of windows. - Yeah! - Yeah, baby, it's my birthday! - There you go, all right! That's my man! - Fuck! - Hey, look, I need to take off here, but-- - Whoa, whoa. No, what, are you gonna leave me in suspense about the role? I mean, you said I got the role. Jesus Christ, it burns. You said that, what, that producer chick, Leslie, she's friends with Shelby, she said I had it in the bag, right? - Yeah, I mean, but she wasn't officially on the show. They canned her a few months ago, and then the network was all concerned that she had some mental illness or some shit, I-- - Well, whatever. What about the other producer? She said she loved me in the audition, and you said you'd put your own money into it, you even thought about quitting manager. We don't need them, we can do this on our own. - I just, I got a lot on my plate right now. - Your plate's really full? I was burying a body in the woods last night for three hours, okay? - You got a sick ass sense of humor, man! - Oh! Hi! Why the fuck haven't you answered your cell phone? - Because I've been playing hostess. Have you seen the fucking news? - I have-- Have you? - No. What? What the fuck is wrong? - They found him, Shelby. They're gonna find us soon, and it's gonna be all over! - What is she on, like a-- - They raided the house in Long Beach, and a DEA agent was killed, some chick. They think it was Felipe. Not to mention his cousin Gabriel, his dad. - Martinez? Shh, shh, shh. - Yeah, yes, Martinez. - Martinez. Wow. Well, that was a matter of time, huh? - Why are you smiling? - Because we were involved with the biggest drug lord's death. - Bitch, you're crazy. - I know. Leslie, have another drink. - The house was raided by federal agents, how are you still so calm? - Because, I didn't use my real name, and Yoni didn't use his, and I'm sure you didn't. Right? - I don't know, I don't remember. - I don't know, I think you're a dumbass. - Hey, easy, Shelby. - What? Why do you care so much? Did you fuck her last weekend? - Shh, shh. - Did you fuck her too? - No. James is right outside, no. I did not fuck her. I didn't fuck you. - We didn't fuck. - The reason that I care is because now I don't have a supply. Shoot. Talking about this in his place, it's probably bunked. - Then you're a bigger dumbass than she is. - Not nice. - DEA agents are probably rifling through my cell phone records, rifling through Brad's cell phone records as we speak. They know something! - Leslie, they don't know anything. We weren't at the party, and we didn't use our real cell phones. - Actually... - Of course you did. - Oh, come on. What? It was the biggest party of the year, I still have a hangover from it. - Bravo, you fucking morons. They see you? The agents, did they see you? - I don't know, we were racing out of there. Maybe they did forensics? I don't know, I mean, look. I mean, I don't know about you, but I have a husband and children, and I cannot do this. - Whoa, hey, hold on, moron number one. - Excuse me? - Stop. ♪ In the name of love ♪ ♪ Before bad and fall ♪ - Are you having a good time, Yoni? - Yeah, I'm just easing some of the tension a little bit. - That's great, good. Okay. I'm gonna be really fucking cool. I'm gonna play it so fucking cool, because we're not going anywhere until I know exactly what happened. Okay? - Fine. - Yes? - Okay. - Okay. So you got rid of the cell phone. - Um, yes. But Brad didn't. He'd been talking to them for a long time, I mean, I knew Gabriel for like three months without an alias. I mean, you know what? For all we know, Brad is out there right now, and he could've been arrested, and then now he's wearing a wire for the cops. We should get out of here, I mean-- - This is not a crime drama, okay? I highly doubt that. But even if he were, you don't pack up your whole family and skip town. Not cool. - I can't believe this, all I did was just like, hook you guys up. - Oh my God. If I have to hear one more story about how you're fired, and you don't have any money-- - You're a fucking cunt! - Ah. Have a seat. - Okay. Let's get on the same page here, okay? No one's gonna find out about this, because there's no connection between us. I don't know you, I've never met you. Leslie? Leslie, Leslie, Leslie. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I might of met her at a casting. But, if some cops or some agents want to stop by Leslie's happy little home, Leslie, the big shot producer with millions of viewrs on her TV shows, is gonna say nothing. - I, I... - She's gonna say nothing, because she knows nothing, and she's gonna lawyer the fuck up. Because if, at the end of the day, my name gets mentioned, or James's name gets mentioned, or Yoni here's name gets mentioned, that is gonna be so bad for you. 'Cause then the CIA, the FBI, the DEA, the LAPD, they're not even gonna have to find me. You know why?

I gotta piss so bad, I'm gonna do it right here. - Nope, that was last year, we're not doing this again. Go inside. Yoni's in there, go hang out. - I'm a little drunk. - Mhm. - Hey. We're not done here, okay? 'Cause we're on to something. Me and you, we're gonna make our own shows, and we're gonna make our own movies, and then we're gonna make a buttload of money. I think he's lying to me. - Okay, babe. Why don't you go inside and get some water, okay? I'm gonna hang out with Brad for a minute. - Okay, baby. - You had something to say? - They were never gonna pick him, you know? - Yeah, asshole, I know. - I tried. - Give it up. - That's grain alcohol. - Brad, I don't give a fuck about the VW show. - Yeah? Well, they got my guy, or some guy. See, the problem is, I don't know if it was Yoni, or Leslie, or you... - Brad, what are you even talking about? Are you asking me a specific question, or... - It's probably one of your stupid fucking model friends that got caught selling the drugs. - Drugs? Brad, drugs? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh no! Oh baby, I'm so sorry, I thought you knew I was giving you the bottle. Oh, Brad, I'm so sorry. What the fuck, Shelby? - Shh, shh, shh, shh. You look very tired from all that booze. You know what? Stay on my couch tonight, no problem at all, and then in the morning we could have breakfast and talk about getting you some help. Oh... I thought you knew me better than that, Brad. I have never, ever touched drugs in my life. Motherfucker. - Aw, Shelby. That's just cruel. Where's Brad? Brad's dead, okay? Just don't worry about it. - What the fuck? Will you guys talk to him about Brad? I can't do it-- - This is your deal, man. - Okay, fine.

Horrible accident. - A horrible accident. That's the way cops see it too. However, James, I see it just a little bit differently. I think you did it. Or Shelby.

You want a little pussy? What is it? - I want the truth. - Yeah. The truth is, is that every man wants those three things. And maybe food. - Well, I've already eaten, I had sex last spring, I have more than enough money, and I have plenty of drugs in my friendly little bag right there. But I tell you what about drugs. Did you know that your wife has half a kilo hidden in your room? - How the fuck would you know that? - Because I have a gift! But obviously you don't want to hear about that. James, let's have some fun. - Well, that's bullshit. That's bullshit. I would know about this. - Hey, James. Since you don't want to tell me the truth, I'll tell you a truth. Did you know that Shelby and Yoni have been moonlighting as drug dealers with a major Mexican cartel? Discuss. - Jesus, you kept this from me? You guys kept this a secret from me? - James, you think your stunt work pays for this house? - I don't care that you were doing it, I just think that'd be something that you'd share with your husband. - Okay, James. Now I shared something with you, now I need you to talk to me. Okay? Give me the truth. - No, we didn't do it, yeah, I know your sister. - Yeah, I know that you knew her, James. Did you kill her? - What the fuck? No, I didn't kill her. - Jesus, it was a hit and run, it was on the news. - Yeah, it was an accident, we had nothing to do with it. - Okay. Shelby? No more lies. - Hey. Aaron. Why don't you try and prove that one of us killed her. Hm? For all we know, you fuckin' killed her. - Good point. Really good, Yoni. How could I possibly accuse you if I haven't cleared myself? That's good. Okay. First off, she was my sister, right? I mean, that's point one. Two, I wasn't even there that day. But let's go deeper. One down, one down. I kept hearing it over and over. In fact, that night, I couldn't even sleep. The next day, I didn't eat. And I told my parents, but my parents, they just thought I was this magician, they thought I was a smart little kid, their special little weirdo child. One down, one down. I told Rose, but it was a blur. It was all just a blur. And then it happened. So my parents made me see a shrink, and then they put me away in an asylum, and that was the better part of my youth. Yeah. Rose always believed me. She was the only one who believed me. Now, I can't see what happened that day. I could see everything, but that day's a blur. But there's one thing that I see. I see a hand hovering over her. - Look, man. I'm sorry about your sister. All right, I really am. I'm sorry about what happened to her, but you have to believe me. I did not hurt her. Shelby did not hurt her. Yoni didn't hurt her. Okay, it was an accident. It was just like they said on the TV. The car was going too fast, and she must've tripped, or dropped something. - Yeah. Yeah, you're right. James. I never liked you. What the fuck, man? - That's hyoscine pentothal. Its only purpose is to produce pure, unadultered pain. It fucking burns. - Mhm. - Dude, you are fucking crazy, man. - There you go, James. Now, James. If you go unconscious on me, I'm just gonna wake you up. ♪ Oh what fun it is to ride ♪ ♪ In a one horse open sleigh ♪ - Jesus, man. You know you should chew them, right? Then you could eat more. - Mm. They're so good though. I guess so. - So, why do people die from these? I don't get it. - Probably choking. - You know, I read people get like, allergies to them and shit. - You actually read something? Shit. I already told you, too. This is weird, you asking me this. You don't remember last week? We had this conversation already. - But how is someone gonna get an allergy from peanuts that taste so good? - They don't get it, they're born with it. Jesus, I already told you. Man, I gotta listen to questions all night about peanuts, and you can't remember last week and what went wrong? - The world's not just random. Where some people can have peanuts, and some people can't. That shit don't make no sense. - Some people die in fires, or shootings, or stabbings. Some you and I caused. Then some people die at six years of age, with cancer. There is no reason. I'm obviously a perfect example of that. - No, bro. Things aren't that random. There's a plan, there was a plan. There's a reason why you and I are here tonight at this house. - Whatever, man. Just watch the damn house and make sure no one leaves. - How long have we known each other for, man? Since kids, puta. You know, like nina. - My bad, I wasn't thinking. - Yeah. Getting your cousin drunk and sleeping with her isn't thinking. It's just plain fucked up. - What the fuck, man? How many times do I have to say it? - You thought I wouldn't be all pissed off about all this, huh? And not get inside your head? 'Cause you're stupid! You banged my sister, your dad liked me more. Screw you, we're even. - I know! I've heard it all my life. How many times you think I heard it from him, huh? I've always been the stupid one! - Yeah, you may be stupid, but you got amazing aim. I'll give you that. And I'm sure your dad would agree. - Well, he's dead. And you're getting on my fucking nerves. Oh, am I? Okay, then shoot me again, pendejo! - You need to shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up, man! Fuck you! - Shit, man. That dude looks familiar, man. - Get down, idiota. - You need to get the fuck out of here, man. I can't do this with you here. - Maybe I will. - Go, man, go! I can't fucking think. Go motherfucker, I can't think with you right here. Go! Come on. You gotta get the fuck out of here. I can't think, I can't think! - Hey. Cuckoo head. Come on, man. Enough is enough, don't you think it's about time you let us all go? Probably have some dumb shirt convention to get to? Just let us get on with our lives. - It's amazing. Look, there's a light on it. Look. - He's looking at his watch. - Look, you're right, Yoni, I'm sorry. We have to get down to business, right? Less than 30 minutes to go, here we go, everyone. So... Who dunnit? Once you confess, we could all go the cops, and then the rest of us can go home. - Oh, the cops? Yeah, somehow I doubt that. Look, if you want us dead, then why don't-- - No, no, no. I don't want you dead. Okay? But there are some things that I just can't control. Right now, I want one of you three to have the balls, guy or girl, to just confess. One of you pushed Rose in front of the car. - It was the driver that did it. - Wow. Good theory. A true sleuth. But it wasn't that. You see, my parents had an autopsy done. Of course, by my request. And she didn't die from the car accident, no, no. She died by suffocation. Right? So unless she decided to hold her breath after getting hit by a car, one of the three of you are lying. Hell, all of you are lying. - Your sister was a bitch. - Shelby. Would you like me to shoot you up with the stuff that I gave James? - Please don't do that. - Please, go right ahead. - Okay. Just calm down. We don't want to get violent. Let's talk about my gift. I'm clairvoyant. - I'm Claire Danes. - Hey, what am I thinking right now? - Okay, I must be getting Punk'd, right? Happy birthday to James, where are the cameras? You guys are into some serious sick shit. And this guy, this guy, I mean, great acting. I should cast you in something, man. - He's not an actor. - What? - Just like she says. I'm not acting, James. This isn't Meisner. God, I was really hoping this would go faster. - Well, you can see it, right? You can see the future. - No, I can't see what happened just for that one day. One down, one down. You've said it, Shelby. You've said it. - Guys, seriously? He has a gun, but if we all rush him right now-- - No, God, stop it, Shelby. It's time to fess up already. - James! - No. I don't know if you think you're some kind of psychic or something, but I think it's time you do hear the truth. - Oh, I'm all ears, James. - Okay. Yeah, you remember me because I went out with your sister a few times. - That's right. - Okay, Rose? Yeah, I dated her. And I bet you remember when I'd come over to your house, and we'd sneak upstairs, and she'd shut the door. Parents were never home. She was breaking a lot of rules. Real nasty stuff at such a young age. And then I got kinda bored with her, then I started dating Shelby over here. And maybe she got so angry she started lashing out, drinking, sneaking out of the house. - Oh, no. She never did those things. - Oh, shit, man. Maybe you just remember me as the bad guy, I didn't even date her for that long. - Yeah, but you had enough time to deflower her, didn't you? And then you started dating this piece of trash. - Fuck you, man! I was the most popular guy in high school. I was a star athlete, and I'm gonna be on a network television show. Who the fuck are you, huh? You're nobody, you're nothing. You're just some freak who's got incestuous feelings for his dead sister. Fuck you! - Yeah, that's right, motherfucker! This guy's gonna be a TV star. - Uh huh. That's great. How are you gonna do that? I just killed your manager. - Oh yeah, that's a good point. - Whew, James. That was great though. You're a good actor, and that's a hell of a hook. Ha! I tell you what, James. Just for that, I'm gonna leave you alone for a second. I mean, I've been focusing on you so much. Oh, sorry about this, Yoni. - What? Now, someone tell me something new, or Yoni is gonna get a little bit lighter. - No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it. - Nope, no way. Hey. Don't worry, he's bluffing. - I don't know. - He wasn't fucking bluffing before! - Oh, Yoni. You need better friends. - Hm. Yoni, it is really hard to have a conversation with the bottom of your shoes. I don't know, maybe come over here and sit with me, it's gonna be so much easier. You know, you're sitting in the little kids' chair, right? That's for, like, real young kids. That's better, right? Okay. I mean, we're not gonna sit here and pout this whole time, right? Because that is gonna make the longest 50 minutes ever. Why don't we talk? You don't want to say anything? - No. - Oh, look at that, you just talked. I think you want to say more too. I really do. Why don't we start with why you two were arguing? Come on. Was it 'cause he was bigger than you? 'Cause you don't like guys that are bigger than you, right? It's like your dad. He made you fight him, right? - You don't know anything about my dad. Nothing! - You're right. You know what? You're right, I don't know anything about your dad, but I do know that sometimes he's home, and sometimes he's not, and I know that he leaves you and your mom all the time. - Well, yeah. He's gotta work. So what? - Wait, Yoni, does that make you angry? How do you feel about that? - I don't care. - Well, I know how hard it can be. You know what? My dad left me and my mom when I was a teenager. I was so angry, hated him, hated him. He hurt my mom too. - I hit that kid for fun. I just wanted to hit him. - Yeah, I get that. I mean, you think that's okay? - Did you want to hit your dad? - Yeah, I did. - Yeah, but you didn't, 'cause you knew he was gonna kick your ass. You were angry. You were too small. I could see it in your eyes. I have it too, I'm always angry. - Well, you know what? As I got older, I hit him back. I mean, I really hit him back. I broke my hand a few times. Didn't even feel anything though. - What did he do to you? - Nothing. Nothing at all. Now, I have answered a few of your questions, which means you get to answer some of mine, all right? Now, when you've gotten really angry, like really, really angry, do you feel stronger? Like, can you lift things when you're angry that are bigger than you? I don't know. - I see. Okay. - But you know, like, I'm super strong, like I could lift stuff, right? - Are you texting right now? - Yes. And I would like it if you didn't interrupt me, 'cause I'm not good at it. But, since you're so eager to talk, talk. - No, I'm good. I'm gonna keep all my fingers. These guys will get ya. - Oh, now you want my help? Fucking bitch. You guys just fucking sat there, you both just sat there while this guy cut off my fucking finger! - That's right, you guys did. What kind of friends are you? Can you believe that, Yoni? Let's get 'em! Come on, I'm the good guy here. I cauterized your wound. It's a good thing you smoke, right? That's right, hard to catch without a finger. - Okay, man. Fine, fine. I killed her. Okay? I killer her, I killed Rose, I killed her. All right? There, I confessed, take me to the fucking cops. - Nah, I killed her. - He did not. I killed her. Shut up, guys, I fucking killed her. - No, both of you stop lying, I killed her. - Aaron, Aaron, I killed her. I killed her. - Okay? - I killed her and I liked it. - Both of you stop lying, I killed her. - I killed her, she didn't even fight! - No, Aaron, I killed her. - Aaron, I killed her, man. - She might be his fling. - Shut up. Huh? I see what you're trying to do. You want to rattle me. But you don't get to rattle me! I do the rattling here. So, let's rattle. Hey, James? You want to be rattled? There's so much to tell you, my God! How about this? Yoni killed Shelby's father. Rattle away. - What the fuck did he just say? Did you keep that from me? - That's not true. - You said he died from a heart attack. Yoni. - I hit him over the head with a shovel. We didn't think that you could go through with it, so we just left you out of it. - Look at you guys! Oh, you're a bunch of wack jobs. - Yeah, I'm a late addition to the party. Fuck you. The op was supposed to fairly simple. She was already in with that piece of shit Brad, and so, but we didn't get the audio right. That was my fuck up. So, when bullets started flying, we were too late. - I'll see you soon. - My wife was dead, and fucking Brad was gone. You know, we just wanted to do some good around here. We were gonna get the drugs off the streets. But how the fuck am I supposed to do that, huh? It's like you're trying to cut the arms off a beast, and right there, before your eyes, two more grow right back in its place. We were gonna leave the world better than we found it. So, we went into the DEA. We went into the academy separately, but we came out together. And this was gonna be the last fucking one, no more. We were gonna settle down, start a family. They told me to go see a shrink about all this shit. They said, "Go see a therapist about your dead wife, "it might help." Yeah. Felipe Martinez could be halfway across the fucking world right now, for all I know. But I'll find him. I'm gonna find that motherfucker, and I'm gonna give him exactly what he deserves. - A little early for a drink? What are you having? - Alcohol. - My favorite. Another alcohol for this one. - No, no, I'm fine. - Look, I'm sorry. I came over, I bothered you, it's the least I could do. I'm Aaron. - Nice to meet you, Aaron. You're not from around here? - No, no, it's Virginia, first time in California. - Business or pleasure? - Business. - All right. - A little bit of pleasure. Well, have fun, man. - Thanks, Mason. - Who are you? - Mason, I gotta go. But you need to do me a favor, you can't stand up, you're gonna fall over if you do. So you need to go home, and you need to sleep all this off, and I'm gonna text you, and you need to be somewhere at one am. Do you understand? - Who the fuck are you? - Who I am isn't important, Mason. Just remember, text, one am. Felipe Martinez. You want him, I got him. Don't stand up, see you soon. - Hey, man, what the... - Had we had just hit that little town and never looked back as kids. How sweet would that'd been? - Pretty sweet. - We could've set up a little shop, selling trinkets, and little bottles of nectars. They started dealing dope. - And your dad would've have been shot in the face a few times. - Whoa, that's good. Now you're remembering. I'm glad, you need to remember the past. Not because of our fathers, but because of what you did, and who you are. You are a bad person, we are bad people. - Yeah, I know. - Do you? Do you? - What the fuck, man? Yeah, I know what happened. - You want to argue with me about people you killed? - I thought that shit was fun. - Well, I lied to you, puta. I never killed anyone. - Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up! You're lying! - It's a game in your head. You saw me as something I wasn't. - No, no. You even told me last night at the bar, you killed that guy at the hotel. - I was at the hotel, I was making a damn deal, you were the one that thought he had a gun, you put a bullet in his chest. And what about his kid? Did he have a gun too? - Kid? What kid, man? - The kid that came out of a bathroom. I didn't even know he was in there. Shit, you shot him too. You don't remember this? - Fuck you man, I saved your life! That guy was gonna fucking kill you, no witnesses. Remember? That's how it works. - He was an eight year old boy, Felipe. You killed him and his father because you wanted to, because you like it, because you're sick. - No, I don't. That's not me, that's not me, man. - Yes, it is. - No, I like some things, but what the fuck are you still doing here, man? Get the fuck out of here, puta! Go, go. - I'll leave again, and again, and again, but I'll still come back. I'll always be here with you, until you join us. I'll always be here, primo. - I can't leave right now, man. I got a job to do, man! I need the failure. - Come on, man, do it! I know you want to. - No, man. No, man, no, man! It ain't my fucking time. - It wasn't my time! It wasn't the fed's time, it wasn't your dad's time. But here we are! - No, man, stop! I don't want to fucking shoot you. - You did! - What the fuck, man? - Shoot yourself, make me go away. - Fuck! Fuck, man! Fuck! So, Aaron, I know this is our first time, I'm Dr. Adams. Go ahead and have a seat. I'm really sorry to hear about your sister. - Thanks. - So your parents thought it might be a good idea for us to talk, you know? Just chat about anything that you want to chat about. Whatever comes to mind. - You know about me already. - Why do you say that? - I touched you, you're gonna send me away. - You're right. I can see things that happen in the future too, just like you. - Can you just tell my mom and dad I can't help it? - No. No, I can't. You're special, Aaron, you're so special. You're completely different from all the other kids I see. I know it must be really frustrating to have this amazing gift that isn't harnessed yet. I understand, I really do. Let me guess. You can flip a coin 100 times and know what it's gonna be, and your parents still don't believe you. - Then what am I gonna say next? - It's not what you want to say, it's what you're thinking. "I hate my parents. "The reason Rosie's dead is because of them." - So, you're like me? - You're much better than me. You could see things that I could never see at my age. You're gonna have to make a choice very far down the road. And that choice could easily lead you to someone of great importance. I can't see it exactly. But you have to trust your gift, Aaron. Hone it. And don't ever tell anyone that you have it, ever again. - But I don't know how. - Do you know what I know? I know that your gift is amazing, and you are gonna be so much better than I ever was. - Will I find out what happened to Rosie? All right, boys and girls. Time is up, and you have all disappointed me, 'cause now I have to kill someone. - Aaron, Aaron, buddy. You remember me, okay? You know me. All right, I would never hurt your sister. - Of course not, James. I don't want to kill you. I really want to kill your wife though. Aaron, please don't do that. - Goodbye, Shelby. - I love you, idiot. - Aaron, come on, stop, put the gun down, man. - Yoni... You have given me a great idea, Yoni. How about this. One last game. It's a short one. The game is called who had sex with Yoni while James was out of town? Shelby! - You're a fucking liar! Big winner. - You fucked him? - James, this guy's been fucking with us all day. You're gonna believe him over me now? - Babe, he's like a brother. - A brother who had sex with your wife. - Oh, no, no, no. He's been fucking with us, but he's Rose's brother, and he might be crazier than a shithouse rat, but everything that he said up to this point is true. So I want to know, what's been going on between you two? - James. - You guys are great. You have so many secrets, you don't even know what the truth is anymore, do ya? - Shut up. - Shut up. - You stay the fuck out of this. James, don't get crazy. - Oh, I'm crazy! Because I think my best friend over here killed your dad, fucked you last week, and I might be the only person in this room who hasn't killed anybody yet? Yeah, that's making me a little upset, Shelby. - This is my favorite side of you. - Calm it down, man, okay? Don't do anything stupid. That's exactly what he wants. - Shelby. Go outside and kill that guy. Yoni and I have to have a little chat. You sure? - Positive. - Love you. This is your time. - Shelby, don't move too fast, don't want you to get shot in the head out there. - So, did you screw my wife? - Shithead. - That's the bad guy over there, okay? Not me. - Okay, yeah. We all know what we did to his sister. - Oh, we? - Yeah, fucking we. - We? - We know! But you and I, we were boys, okay, we're best friends! And I go away for a weekend, and you can't even keep your dick in your pants-- - What the fuck do you want from me, man, huh? You want me to admit it? Fine, I admit it! I fucked her. Well, come on, man! I'm fucked up! I'm a fucking guy, huh? That's what we do! I've loved her since we were kids, and you knew that, and you never wanted to admit that to yourself, man. And she chose you. She fucking loves you. I know that, I know that completely. But I also know that she's getting really fucking tired of you pussing out on your little murder excursions 'cause you can't ever seal the fucking deal, huh? But you want to know something? I can! - Get him, James! - Oh, fuck, it was you! - Shelby? - You were never right for her. You always made me do the dirty work. You little chicken shit! Federal agent, don't move. - Okay, okay, calm down. He was assaulting me, I was just defending myself. - What are you gonna do, man? Huh? Are you gonna shoot me? Hey, look, no more lies, okay? I did it. I really did it. I killed her. Shelby threw her out in the road, that drunk asshole hit her. We were just there for the cleanup, man. This motherfucker was supposed to finish her off, but he couldn't. So I did it. I put my hand over her mouth and I watched as the life slipped away from her. What? Come on, come on, come on! Shoot me! Come on, Aaron, shoot me! - Calm down, he was trying to kill me, I was just defending myself, Officer. - Drop the weapon. - Officer, he was trying to assault me. And the guys in the house, you understand, they raped me. - Back away, now. He was one of them! - You. - So glad to see you, Mason. You made it. - All right, look, I don't know what the fuck is going on right now, but I need you both to put your hands in the air, and get on the ground, now. - Ease, take it easy. Get out of the street for me. - Get down, now. - I'm doing this 'cause I love you. - I know this is confusing, but just stay with me. That's Felipe. That's Felipe. Just look. See. - Hey! - Did you see that coming, freak? - Of course, I'm psychic, and you're not fit to be a mother. It's okay, it's okay. She killed my sister. - Who's that? - Oh, that's Yoni. You don't need to worry about him. In three hours he's gonna hang himself. - Whoa, hey. - It's okay. Here. For Felipe. You can't use your own gun, right? Take it. I'm sorry about your wife. I gotta go. Dad, it's Aaron. Yeah. No, I got 'em. They're dead. All of them. No. Let mom rest.
