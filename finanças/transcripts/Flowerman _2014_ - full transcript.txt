My name is Sarah. I have two children Michael & Katrina. I also have a husband Andrew. And I love them all. In fact I love them so much I would die for any one of them, a hundred times over. We may look like a normal loving family, but are we are not. Something happened that made us far from normal. Something that made apart from the real world. Something that tore deep into our souls. Of course I never thought I would really have to give my life for them. You never do. But I lost something else. Like my soul died while my body lived on. I lost something I had always taken for granted. Something that transcends language. I really hope that by writing this story I can try and make sense of it. And maybe, just maybe help you understand it a little. I am Sarah. And this is my story. When are we having another baby? Another baby? Phew, I don't know. - Well it has to be a boy. - Oh does it now? No it doesn't it has to be a girl. It has to be a boy. - Girl. - Boy. We can't help what we have. We could have twins, a girl and a boy. That would be good. Do you really want another brother or sister? I love you two so much! I will have a word with you Dad tonight, Shall I? I will always be there for you two. You know that don't you? Can we make the cakes today? - Morning. - Ah the cat. Yes we are making the cakes. - What are you two like? - Who needs an alarm clock! Morning gorgeous! I know what you are going to say. - Can I do it. -"Can I do it". Ah! Thank you. You promise to be gentle? Yes. Ah look it's swimming in here! Come on that's enough, come on you have washed your hands. If you want to make the cakes now stop it. Look I made a smiley face, I'm done with all the cakes. You're done? - Yes. - Do you want some sprinkles on? Your's is nice Katrina. Thanks. Put some in your hand and sprinkle it on. Hi Amanda. - Hello - Hello. I'm returning that favour. Oh bless you! Are these for me? Oh they're gorgeous thank you. You're welcome. Katrina and Michael helped. Did they? Wow they're great. Thank you sweetheart. They are very special cakes aren't they Mummy? Special why are they special? Because Daddy said he would take us all to Durham for making them. -Oh Wow! - Yes he did. He's on a promise. If I eat one do you think I will be able to come too? Yes. Do you? We can go and ask him because he is coming along the road now. Oh here's Daddy! Oh Hiya. How's my little girl? - Fine. - You alright? There are no words so listen to my song. How can you that woman love? Why not love me and our child? We both deserve you here and now. Our warmth and our love defiled. I feel despair and cry such stifled sounds. My life hangs by . . . (music). What that? I'm not watching this. Is that you again? It is I can tell by your face. Turn that back over now. I know what you are doing. How? How! I just know it. Have you got the remote control over there? You insult me! Sarah tell him! let Daddy have it. You know how he can't cope if someone else has got the remote. Katrina get that remote off your brother.

Well tell him he going to get his arse spanked off me. It will be in front of everyone this time! Do you not think you are kinda letting him get away with just a little bit too much?

Just let me know that everything's okay? Bye. Sarah! Sarah! Amanda! - Amanda! - What? Where's Sarah? I thought you could tell me! Well has she not been in work today? Well she did come in. I left her in charge. When I came back the whole place was locked up. There was a stupid note on the counter. Well she was supposed to pick up the kids at three and she hasn't been. Well she has done a runner hasn't she? I'm not surprised mind after all the bloody messing around you've been doing! Just go over home and have a think about it. (Over speaker). The gag is for me. No one will hear you scream. But noise will make me angry, And you won't want to see me angry. Nigel. what's going on? The gag is for me. No one will hear you scream, but noise will make me angry. And you won't want to see me angry. You won't be needing that! You belong to me now. And you will be known as Wendy. The name your mother called you in childhood. How did you know that? Oh Wendy, I know everything there is to know about you. Remember I'm always watching. Get up, Get up! Thank you for deciding to get this done. It will help you remember who your owner is. Now keep still or this will look shite! And I hate shite. So I will have to do it again and again. Did you know two-hundred-and-ten-thousand people disappear from this country every year? It's almost six-hundred every day. Just let me go and I won't tell anyone. But where would you go? Andrew has his new girl and she is good with the children. You're lying. Just let me go. I won't lie to you Wendy. It hurts me that you don't believe me. But please be a good girl. Because I would hate to have to really damage you. We will watch some TV later. That's nice isn't it? Please don't. Please don't. Oh No. You have behaved well Wendy so you can put this on. I'll take to to wash you daily. Don't make a mess in here, do you understand? I will bring you some knickers later. Because you are so obviously menstruating. Fuck you. Tattooing, it's a marriage between art and hygiene. If I want you to get more you will get more my dear. Well Henry, we're going to make Andrew pay for getting rid of Sarah aren't we? Somebody at the door, come on. Oh morning officer, you are right on time come on in. Thank you for seeing me at such short notice madam. I do appreciate it. Well I thought it was best that you came to the house. It's such a sensitive matter. I hope you understand. Shall In take a seat? Yeah go on straight into the sitting room. I told you only visit when I tell you. But I'm your brother NIgel and I love you and I'm worried about you. Please? Five minutes. You don't need to be concerned. If I need something from you I'll tell you. It's just that you have been quiet for weeks. And the last time that happened. I told you you don't mention that. It never happened. What happened to the girl you were seeing then, the way you were treating her? She wanted it. That's how they are they need control. I'm so worried for you it is not normal. Promise no harm came to her. Harm! Harm like you think I did to you as we grew up you mean. You are so cruel you are the only brother I've got and the only family I've got. You're pathetic. You always have been. You say you are my brother? How can that be possible? There there little brother. I love you too. Don't cross me though. There's no Mummy and Daddy to protect you now. Promise you are not going to hurt anybody again. Hurt? Hurt and love are the same. You say you love me? Then stay. And I'll show you what love is. Ian, your five minutes are up. So anyway, his floozy, she's always over there. You would think she was the poor kids' mother. Did Mrs Jefferson confide in you about her intentions prior to her disappearance madam? Only a short note saying what a cheating scumbag he was. But I knew that already. When did you last hear from her? A couple of days ago. Just a short text saying that she was really happy. If I could see the text? And take a written statement from you? Yes that is no problem. I will go and get them. I've booked you on leave and I've put Jonathan in charge of the office for the week. So I will be round to help you and the kids. Wow Jenny. That's great. I don't know what I would do without you. I'm sorry. I'm grateful really. I didn't mean that. I haven't got any close family. So, is it just Sarah's family then? Yeah, pretty much. Her brother rang today. Said she had texted round the family. What? Look you have to face reality babe and move on. Reality? He said we were living separate lives. That's what the text said. She was seeing someone else. And so was I. What! Someone else? I can't believe it. She couldn't have been seeing anyone. Could she? Surely? Well if you had of been it would of been with me. God knows I've tried long enough. Look, I guess you know her but ask yourself, why would she be doing all this? I don't know. I can't understand it. Look maybe you two are too close to understand it. I mean, it seems pretty clear to me. Meaning? Look face it babe. She's dumped you in the cruelest way she could. Look I'm going to clean this place up it's starting to look like a pig sty. Jenny. Yeah? I got a text the day she left. From her? From Sarah? Yeah. It said goodbye, and it said to move on. It said she couldn't keep up an act anymore. Oh! Oh I'm sorry. Face reality Andrew. It my hurt now but it's less than carrying on this denial. I don't know what to do. You know I've loved you for ages don't you Andrew? And I promise I would never hurt you the way she has. And make sure you wash thoroughly. And by thoroughly I mean everywhere. All those little nooks and crannies. Seven minutes. Times up. Stand up! Come to me. Lift your arms up I'm going to dry you. Oh why will no one believe me. Look Sarah had no reason to run off. Something's happened! Why should something of happened to her sir? Find her please! Oh we will find her. And when we do let's hope nothing has happened to her. Then that's you off the hook. What does that mean? Look sir, between me and you I don't suspect foul play. All the evidence points to her simply having left you. No don't do that! You know you are not allowed to do that. Please! Ah no! Ah no! Remember Wendy you're responsible for what happens. You control your own fate. (Scream). Look sir, I'm not unsympathetic this is what women do. The kids drive them mad the good life beckons. I was not having an affair! That stupid cow in the shop in the shop was well she's . . . She's got it all wrong. ink people aren't talking about what you are up to and it is all they are doing. Me and Jenny are just friends. She was there when I needed her. That's it. One door closes and another opens. It's best just to get things out in the open. Do you think I really care what people say? All I care about is getting Sarah back safely. We do take all these disappearances seriously Sir. We will find Sarah and we will find what has happened to her. In the meantime take my advice. You are giving me advice? Really? And what advice would that be? Get some anger counselling and put your demons to rest. Then you'll feel better. Oh just fuck off, go on! We will go now. I hope for your sake that we find her soon. Just go now. Please. Just leave me alone. Please, why are you doing this? Now that is such a silly question. You're an intelligent girl, I've just explained. You mean I've done this to myself? That I'm to blame? Exactly! Just keep to the rules my love. Just how much tattooing can your body take in one day? Roger! What do you want? Well I don't care. That's your problem now. I told you, you were in charge of the office this week. Deal with it. Don't bother me with trivia. Okay? I can't stand seeing you so low. I can't seeing you so upset. You need me? No jenny I'm not ready. You need to move on babe. I'm here to help you. Oh, for fuck's sake! What do you expect? Just fuck me and it will clear your head. Enough talking. You're there for ever. I love you Wendy. You're mine forever. You can't go anywhere. There's no need to even try. I'm always watching you. I see you still have plenty of energy left. It's nearly time for me to go and get the kids. Why don't you get up and have a bath? Actually you can hoover the stairs while you're there. I'll go for the kids. No you won't. I will. They need their routine. Things have changed now anyway. You're mine. Now isn't that better? A nice bath. A chinese takeaway. And now a video at the start of a romantic night. See how happy they all are? That means nothing you bastard. He just knows her. No shouting I don't tolerate noise. Too fucking bad. Now hold still, or this could be dangerous. (Stifled cries). That's better. That's enough tv for now. Night night. God bless. (Sobbing). Why are you with her? Ow! Now you must let me look after you. The last thing you want is an infection. Come through here. Sorry to bother you sir. We've come to advise you on how we are proceeding with your complaint. Okay. We have decided to keep the case open for the time being. What? And what does that mean exactly? The evidence supports the case for your wife having left you sir. So why keep the case open? We need a statement from Mrs Jefferson in order to close the case madam. Look all me and Andrew want is closure! It seems she wanted to avoid ssues that caused her to leave. She will probably be with somebody else by now. What about her family? It seems she is in hiding right now. Look madam it's obvious what's going on here and it's not something the police can help with. Look, I just need to know that Sarah's safe. Well she has taken her bank cards sir. When she uses them we will find her. Then you can all play happy families with Mr Jefferson Miss. Right, thank you very much. I appreciate this I will see you out. Well done. More tokens for you. And as a special treat an outing. (Stifled voice). Anything you want. Now that's what I like to hear. Pop these clothes on. And the radio mike. Where are you taking me? To the bank. You're going to make a counter withdrawal. You want to draw some money out? You have to show how okay you really are Wendy. You're stopping people from moving on. Rule number one. Don't fuck this up or they will pay. Bang! No more house with ex-husband and ex-brats. Now wouldn't that be a relief for all of us? Don't forget to take your tablets 'cause the doctor said they would take two weeks to start working and make you feel better. Okay? - It's just so hard. - I know, I know. (Phone ring). Hello? Hello officer. Yes it's me. Really? So what's going to happen? I will tell him. Yes I will. Come on what? Sarah's been in the bank. And they said that apart from a touch of laryngitis she seems fine. I'm sorry dear. And are they sure it was definitely her? Yes, they've seen it on the CCTV. It's definitely her? Yes. Well did they say anything else? I don't know. hey are making further enquires. Well? And that's it! Yeah. (Phone bleep). Your mother wants a divorce. But don't worry, Daddy and I will be here to look after you. Daddy and I will be here for you. You're very brave to want all that tattooing in all one go. Now this is your programme. Getting a star depends on keeping to the ground-rules. A star! You get fed today. Haven't you done well that is fantastic. Well done! I like you Wendy. So please don't get yourself all fucked up. Not any more than you already are. Now you must stay in this room. You were brilliant today. And as a special reward you get more than a token. You are going to be my wife. I will be arranging the marriage at the local registry office. Do you like that? It's just for you. And now I have another engagement present for you. Please God bring mummy home. Mummy. That's perfect. What are you going to do with me? Please don't hurt anyone. Then obey the rules my slut. I'm trying to. Then you will screw me and no condoms. We shall have a family with two kids. so you can forget your ex-brats. No I'm married to Andrew. You're divorcing him you stupid bitch! I have already informed him from by text your phone. No, no, no, no. Yes you fucking are! You see the fucking solicitor tomorrow. We are fucking engaged. Fuck me about and I'll kill them. Perhaps you would like me to cut something off one of them as a little tease? No I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it! That's better. You're only helping them anyway. Your only future is with me. Tic tac toe hit me high hit me low. Hit me three in a row. Hit me three in a row. Granny got caught by a UFO. Katrina! MIchael! Tic tac toe hit me high it me low hit me three in a row. Sit down there. I want you nearer the table. Come on. Come on shuffle, shuffle! I've got your passport here. Your marriage licence. They are all prepared for tomorrow. Now I shall prepare you. Now we are going to play some role play. Now this cup is Nigel sitting there. Now look at Nigel in a loving way. You have been screwing behind your husband's back for months. Now look at Nigel. Look at Nigel! Now say I love you Nigel. Say I love you Nigel! I love you. Yes that's right I'll be acting as guardian now. How is Mr Jefferson? Well It's been a really hard time for him and the children. Well he will need to confirm the arrangements. Em yes I've got a letter here doing just that. Okay that's great, lovely. Okay. I do appreciate your discretion on this. Of course. My name is Jenny Edwards. My mobile number is in there. It's probably best to call me in the first instance. You've done very well. Five more tokens. Now you can have breakfast and a wash. You must wear this. Now cut the sleeves and the bottom half off. This is my best top. Why? I can't . . . Because I want the fucking solicitor to see how much you love me! After all you allowed me to brand you. Bastard. Andrew, the baby's kicking! So there are two main issues. You want to change your name by deed poll and petition for divorce? Mr Patterson was speaking to you my darling. Yeah. It's a little complicated. May I suggest you just use your second name of Wendy and revert to your maiden name? Complicated, why complicated? Well the name change will have to be imposed on all the legal documents first that would be costly and unnecessary. What ever is expedient. As long as Mr Jefferson gets the message that only I own her, both body and mind. I take it the grounds are that the relationship is irretrievably broken down? any concept of relationship that he festers is purely delusional. Will you sign this statement to confirm your adultery Wendy? Tell Mr Patterson how you have been screwing behind the pig's back for the last couple of years my love. We've prepared these typed affidavits. They're explicit. I think attention to detail is important. Well succinct and to the point. You sign, I'll witness. Right, I'll write to your husband to request a divorce. Things will be much easier if he doesn't contest it. He tried setting the police on her just for bravely getting away. Wendy you do realise that I will have to disclose details of your adultery to Mr Jefferson? Yes just do it. Right I'll get my secretary Debbie to drop the letter off on the way home. She goes that way. And people say solicitors are slow. I'll keep you informed of the progress. Thank you. Come on kids. They were straight out today. What's that? Hey give that back it's special. Are you kidding me? So you are using me to do all your housework and be your dogsbody. It's not like that Jenny you know that. I actually don't believe this. Jenny we're grateful really! Daddy I miss Mummy. I miss her too darling. That feels better doesn't it? There. You know why we are doing this don't you? Make Andrew very jealous. I'm rather good at this aren't I? He likes your hair like this doesn't he? Right. Get naked. I'll fuck you now and he gets the tape tomorrow. No fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Yes, yes. It's a toy. It's a fucking toy! Where's Mummy? She's somewhere warm and cozy. That's where you should be right now. So come on off to bed. Off to bed. Come on. Goodnight then. Come on. Don't' go all soft on me. Anyway it's time for your therapy. Bastard! When are we having another baby? Another baby? Phew, I don't know. - Well it has to be a boy. - Oh does it now? No it doesn't it has to be a girl. It has to be a boy. I love you two so much. I'll have a word with your Dad tonight shall I? I'll always be there for you two you know that don't you? Mammy, Mammy! Please come home. Mammy! Where's she gone? Your name's Sarah isn't it? What's that with the Wendy on your arm? - Is your girlfriend? - No. Okay, listen it's fine, okay it's fine. You don't have to explain no one will judge you. Look at me. I get enough of that anyway myself. I have to talk. I have to tell someone. Hiya babe. Are you alright? No not really. Take a look at that. It's off Sarah's brief. She wants a divorce. She's in a relationship with someone else. Well believe it's reality. You are with me now so fuck her. Yeah but I still love her. What! What do you think that does to me! I don't care what it does to you. This you, me, us. It's all too fast. I need to speak to Sarah. I need to hear it from her. Simple as that. Well it sounds to me as if you already have. You know what? If you carry on like this you'll be a single parent family. Do you get it? You poor little cow. Really. You've been through hell. I can't believe what's happened to me I really can't. All your bruises. And you look wrecked. All your tattoos are recent. I believe you. I think, would the police? What? I have to tell them. Look at yourself? Do you think they will believe you? Why wouldn't they? You have! Sarah, jail is hell. I've done time there. Women go crazy. No one will be bothered about you. It's man's world. They will wonder why you went along with it. And even you got a meeting with a sodding solicitor for God's sake! He threatened my children! He's a monster. Forty-eight hours and the tracker battery dies. South-south-west. Range five kilometers. So you never got further than the nearest town. I've no home. Andrew's got another woman. That's a man's thing okay? You will get over it. And all you know about your family is what that psycho told you. In that case really you don't have to do anything at all. How? The police are involved. They will have found the body by now. No no. You're a survivor. You've been through a lot. Could you make living like me? No. I mean, it's not for me. Sarah girls don't do what I'm doing just because they are too spoilt for the choice. Yeah, DI Lambert? Yeah It's Andrew. Jefferson. Yeah well you wanted to hear from me if I heard anything from Sarah? I just had a letter off her solicitor. Oh my God Sarah! We should get rid of this bag. It could link us to him! Oh my God! You're right. We need to get rid of it. I'm not supposed to do this. You know that? I do appreciate it Mr Patterson. It is in her best interests. I did think they were a bit of a strange couple. But you get all sorts. Anyway here's the address. Thank you very much. Good luck. - Goodbye. - Goodbye now. Maria, Maria! Maria I've overslept I'm sorry. Maria, Maria I've slept in I'm sorry. Maria? Maria? Lives in the middle guv. It's called rural living constable Smart. God knows, it must be good to get away from people. How do you think we should approach this? Well he is a bit of a loaner. That does concern me. I want to have a good look around there. There's someone at the door. One noise from you and you'll pay the price. Do you hear me? One noise from you and you'll pay the price. Mr Nigel Simmonds? My name is DCI Lambert and this is Constable Smart. Do you mind if we come in? No. We're looking for Sarah Jefferson Sir. Is she in? No she's is out at the moment. We need her to help close an investigation. Could I ask you when she will back? I've no idea. This is the last address she was at isn't it? Yes. But she's not here now. These marital situations guv. I would rather stick to one night stands myself. Yes you would be surprised at how many relationships end up in murder sir. It's quite a big place you've got here isn't it really? How do you afford this farm and all these buildings here sir? My brother and I inherited them. And where's your brother now? He lives in the town. He doesn't like living here but he still owns half. But we have an agreement. Quite the persuader aren't you? What do you mean by that? ll you persuaded Sarah Jefferson to leave her family didn't you? It was love a first sight. Affairs of the heart. There's rarely any logic involved. Yes I must agree with you there sir. That's quite a nasty wound judging by the dressing on your face sir. Can I ask you what happened? I live on a farm. I had a small accident. And has anybody had a look at that for you? No I dealt with it myself. And how did you do that? I stitched it. So you are here entirely by yourself? Yes. It's quite a dangerous place to have accidents when you're alone sir. I like the isolation. Do you mind if I use your bathroom before we leave? Is it through here sir? Please leave things alone. I will just show him where the bathroom is. Oh my God! What are you doing! Bitch! Good news or bad news? Fuck you! Good news is one of you can stay. Bad news is one of you has to go. You decide. What are you taking about? What do you mean by go? That's for you to work out, decide quickly. Just leave us alone! Do your pathetic mind games and leave us alone! Yes is is a fucking game and I make the rules. So who's going to die? Leave us alone! Leave us alone! Please no! Shut up! Just for God's sake shut up! Shut up, Shut up! Shut up. he fuck are we going to get out? -Shut up or he is going to kill us! (Screaming). One. One. One. Oh my God! Keep down he's enjoying it! I don't want to die either. Oh please God no! Two! Two! Two! - No please God no! - Shut up Sarah, shut up! Three! Three! Three! No not the kids! Not my kids! Please not my kids! They're children! Four. Four. Four! No please don't do anything to Andrew. I could give you another injection into your larynx to shut you up. Please not the children! Please for God's sake! Shut up! I could give you another injection into your larynx to shut you up! No! Jesus Christ. Like the silence of the lambs taken to the slaughter. But no madam scream! Scream it invigorates me. - Five. Five. Five. -Touch my fucking family and I will kill you! I'll fucking kill you! Quiet down. Quiet down for God's sake he will kill us! Quiet down. He will kill us! Oh God! God! No! No! - Oh I nearly forgot. - No. No. No! No! No! No! No! I love the sudden orgasmic silence that greets the moment of death. Jesus Christ! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria I'm sorry. Maria hold on! You can be free now my angel. And as you decompose all the festering diseases you will of caught will be purged. And has my insemination made you pregnant yet? Are you growing my life inside of you? Please, please don't ignore me my love. I find that so hurtful. Why I'm not ignoring you. I'll tell you what. Let's have a nice cup of tea. I'll just pop out and put the kettle on. Maria? Maria? Please. Please can you hear me Maria? Maria? Can you hear me? And let me know when your slut friend is dead. Then there'll just be the two of us. t's when the fun really starts. - Maria! Maria! Please can you hear me? - Please please no! No please. - That's six, six, six. Listen Jenny we need to sort this out. Things are moving too quickly. I don't feel that I have got any control over anything. I'm sorry. n't want you to feel pressured. Honestly it's not what I intended. It's just that I've loved you ever since I met you you know? We've known each other for years. I know but I didn't have the confidence to tell you then when you were with Sarah. Then we got jobs at the same place. It's been hard. - Fate eh? - Yeah. Look, what do you want to do? You're bound to be upset after getting that letter. I just don't believe it. We were so close. We had known each other for so long. I just know there's something wrong. One and two and three they died today in a killing spree. Four and five and six they come next on my killing list. Could she really of been with someone else, I mean you spent so much time with her? I believe it don't think she could do it. Look I think you need space. But I'll be here for you. And I'll wait for you. If that is what you want. I do need space but I need to talk to her. I need to find out what is going on. I can't move on until we do that. To be young again eh? Why do things have to get complicated? They sure do when you get older anyway. No answer. No four, five or six. We will wait and anticipate. Now where do you think they could have gone? Do you want to think about getting back? Well I'll think about it but can't we stay a little longer? Yeah I suppose the kids won't mind. Bless them. do them good to get out of the house as well you know. Too many memories. Me head's just so messed up. Life goes on you know Andrew. We have all been through hell. You've got to make the most of your life. You could be dead tomorrow. Life can change on a sixpence. Well I suppose seeing you put it like that. Stay maybe a little bit longer. That's better! Yeah well maybe but I Still don't know what tomorrow is going to bring. It is so important that you can take in the sounds and the smell. The thought of your lovely children and Andrew lying cold on the slab. Now doesn't that make you just a little moist? My darling Wendy. Nothing about you eludes me. I understand your feelings, because I can smell your orifices. The flowers were a necessary perversity to get near you. It's the smell of death, that's life's true wonder. Oh to see the beauty in your eyes as I reunite you with your loved ones during their final moments. Our mutual orgasm as I inseminate you as the aroma of death surrounds. The intensity. The ecstasy. It's nature's gift. Nothing is more sensual than the power to procreate life. And the ability to destroy it. No, I understand they must die slowly enough to be aware that their hold on life is over. And then we may self-actualise for just a few moments longer to savour our omnipotence over them. They've arrived. Wendy they're here. You horrible little bastard! You horrible little bastard! Andrew! Die you fucking bitch! You okay darling? Yes. You know it's weird. It's like it never happened. Like it was almost a bad dream. - I know. But it is like Jenny said. Life can turn on a sixpence. And she was right. Andrew. I just hope you know I would never ever leave you. I love you and the kids so much. You know that don't you? Yeah of course. I knew deep down you wouldn't of done anything like that. But I feel guilty now that I thought that in the first place and I want to make up for it. I love you you know. You better have. After all that therapy. Yeah well it was good though. It helped us understand everything. No more nightmares. No more flashbacks. Just us. Okay? I love you. I love you too. Oh my dears but you've seen nothing yet! People say life goes round in circles. For me it has. My story may not of have ended there. But the part of me I lost did. I wish you a happy and peaceful life. Like the one I once had.
