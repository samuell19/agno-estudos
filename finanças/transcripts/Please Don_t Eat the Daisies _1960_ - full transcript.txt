Oh! Attaboy, Adam. Bull's-eye. I got enough for a couple more. Hurry up. We got a good crowd. [Noise] It's awful quiet out there. What's going on? Oh, what are you doing with it this time? Empty that thing and please put it--Adam? Adam. Give it to mommy, sweetheart. That's a no-no. Adam, don't drop it, sweetheart. Give it to mommy. Give it to mommy, it's a no-no. Give it to mommy, Adam. Don't drop it. That does it. George, Gabriel, no television for you two tonight. What did we do? You never said anything about paper bags out the window. You just said cherry pits and marbles. Anyway, we didn't drop 'em. It was Adam. I suppose it was Adam's idea, huh? Yes, I know, sweetheart. It wasn't your fault. [Baby cries] Well, gee, if they murdered somebody, it would be the guy that shot the gun to go to jail, not the one that got the idea. So Adam's the one that shouldn't get to watch television. I mean, if you want to be fair. Well, I don't want to be fair. Now, what do you think about that? So nobody gets to watch television, including the attorney for the defense! Oh, just once in my life, I'd like to get dressed without an audience. Boy, if we made a mess like this in our room, she'd sure carry on. Listen, when I make a mess, I clean it up. When you make a mess, I clean it up, too. Good-bye, gentlemen. What do you do that for? To make my eyelashes longer. What do you want them to look longer for? Everybody wants-- oh, fellas, now you know I have to meet-- David, put that down. I'm very late. Will you please have a heart? Look whose better instincts I'm appealing to. Mrs. Mackay. Yes? Maybe I ought to feed the kids before I go, seeing it's a new babysitter. Let her have the pleasure. You'd better go, Maggie. It's after 6:00. After 6:00! Oh! See you in the morning. George, this is my last warning. You eat tomatoes in bed once more and you scrape the seeds off the sheets. Oh, Maggie, you always say that. I know. [Telephone rings] [Everyone] I'll get it! I said I'll get it. Hello. Oh, hi, mother. I can't talk. I'm dressing to meet Larry. What? Mother. Mother, why did you promise? You know Larry only gets two tickets for openings. Mother, critics-- critics don't ask producers for favors. What if producers ask for favors back? Well, mother, I'm sorry, you'll have to be mad. Ow! For heaven's sake, I'm sorry. [Telephone rings] [Everyone] I'll get it! Hello. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Ok. It's for you. Who is it? How should I know? Hello. Oh, Alfred North, boy producer. It's your godfather, dopey. How are you, godfather? Full of opening night jitters? Not a jitter to my name. Just had our final run-through. I've never been this happy and relaxed about a show. It's Larry I'm worried about. Kate, his first signed review as a major critic's awfully important. Everyone will be looking for it. Don't make him nervous about it. Just let him come to the theater, enjoy himself, and write what he feels. Tell him for me I'm feeling pretty sentimental about my opening night being his opening night, too. He made a fine, slobbery speech on the very same theme this morning. Stop it! Not you, Alfred. George. What? Not you. Alfred. Kate, dear, this is a very old vaudeville bit. What's the matter with you? I have four kids, and they're all in this room! That's what's the matter with me! Out! Darling, I've got to go. Of course we'll be at the party. I've lost 5 pounds and bought a new dress for it. I'll be praying when the curtain rises. Bye. Stop it! I mean it now. Go on in there and play go play with hobo. He's asleep. That's all he does is eat and sleep. He's a dog. What do you want from him, blank verse? What about Adam? Go talk to Adam for a change. What about, cokee-cola? Maybe you should have lost 10 pounds. Help me, huh? Help me, David. Zip it up now. Aahh! Oh! Sorry. You just took a pound of dear old mother. Keep going, no matter how much I holler. All right. Up? Yeah. Ok. Thank you. There. How do I look, fellas? Like you're going to bust. Flatterer. [Doorbell rings] Get it for me, will you? It's the new babysitter. And be nice. Don't scare her. Hi. Does Lawrence Mackay live here? Yeah. But he's not in. Want to talk to my mother? That's his wife. Yeah, if she isn't busy. She's not busy. Just getting dressed, that's all. Come on in. Cooooo-kee! Cooooo-la! What's the matter with him? Nothing. What's he all locked in for? So he won't get out. They keep you all in cages when you were little? No, just him. Mrs. Greenfield? Oh, you're not Mrs. Greenfield. Uh--um... I'm Joe Positano. You're Mrs. Mackay? There's a little old lady runs a pet shop off east 62nd street. She's your mother. Yes, I know. She says I should see your husband. You see, I only drive a hack to make-- Mr. Positano, why does my mother want you to see my husband? I wrote this play! Wait till I tell you the idea. It'll knock you right on your backside. Would you excuse me? I'm in an awful hurry. It's a musical. It's based on the first two books of the old testament. You know, the Bible. How's that for universal appeal? Staggering. Ain't it? All right, so now I got it, I want an opinion. A little advice, maybe, how to improve it. Mr. Mackay is not a playwright. Who needs a playwright? I'm a playwright. All I need's a fella who's going to tell me what's wrong, if anything--a critic. My husband is a very new critic. He was a professor of drama at Columbia, wasn't he? Ok. Who knows more than a professor? Besides, I read a lot of his articles and reviews of those off-Broadway plays he wrote. Pips, all of them. And on top of that, the man's a square. When he reviews a play, he just doesn't make a bunch of wisecracks like the rest of those bums. He takes it serious. That's true, isn't it? What do you say? Do I get to see him? Why don't you drop by Sunday morning? You got yourself a deal! So long, fellas. Bye. Bye. Don't tell him the idea of it, huh? Let it come as a surprise. Lady, you scared the... Daylights out of me. Oh, come in. It is Mrs. Greenfield, isn't it? Oh, yes, indeedy. I got my cab if you're going anyplace but Brooklyn. How about eighth street? My husband's lecturing at the new drama workshop. I won't even start my meter till you get down. That's the kind of sport I am. Deal. Mrs. Greenfield, you may think I'm a beast, but I really have to go right now. You think you can manage? Why certainly, dear. I can tell just by looking at your boys they'll be perfect gentlemen. Into the bedroom, perfect gentlemen. I want a few words with you. This one's all right. Just keep an eye on him when you let him out. Coooo-kee. Co-whooooooo-la! I beg your pardon? I saw the way you looked at her, so don't try to kid me. Listen, fellas, be my good and true friends. Don't make a fuss about supper, or your baths, or going to bed, ok? Ok. Ok. And please, don't throw anything out of the windows or down the John. What if I feel spit-uppy? What, are you expecting to? No, but if I do, I'm not supposed to throw anything down... Oh, come on! David, listen to me. Before you do anything, think about what I would say, ok? Gee, ma, you act as if we were monsters or something. Well, you are. You're just lucky that I happen to be peculiar and love monsters. Now give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. I'm just a kissless mother, that's all I am. Mrs. Greenfield, the numbers where I can be reached are on the desk. The boys' supper is in the refrigerator. I think that's everything. Mrs. Mackay, do you mind my asking? What's the problem with the little boy? Adam? When I saw the barred windows and the locked pen, my heart bled for you. Is he backward? Backward? Mrs. Greenfield, when you were 18 months old, could you pick a lock, any lock? Certainly not. Well, Adam can. Good night. There are many theories about the drama-- that it should educate people or inspire them, that it should reflect life or change it. I believe it can do any of these, provided it also entertains. Because to my mind, the basic function of all theater, from Greek drama to the circus, is to entertain. Bravo. I'm sure we're all very grateful to professor Mackay-- or shall I say, ex-professor Mackay? Since, as of today, he begins a new career as one of the seven major drama critics of the New York press. Question, question, Mr. Mackay. The major drama critics have a great influence on our theater and great power. You, yourself, as a part-time reviewer have been a constructive and fair man. Do you think you can stay fair now that you're one of the holy seven? [Laughter] Well, to me, my job merely means that I should be able to spend much more time doing the one thing in the world I love most, which is going to the theater. But you won't be just any loving theatergoer. You'll be one of the seven men who can close any show in this town, and I can guarantee you that as soon-- just a minute. You guys go to a play hoping it's lousy. It isn't what happens on stage that matters, it's how clever you can be about trying to destroy it! Well, I assure you that every opening night, when the curtain goes up, I shall hope to see something great. But I shall be paid by my newspaper to give my opinion. So what else can I do except give it honestly? That's what you say now! Why should your opinion mean more than anybody else's? Who are you to judge? Please, please. Of all the nasty little... Oh, they're young. And it's difficult for them getting started off in the theater. Still, they do seem to have a certain hostility to critics. I noticed. Happy about tonight? All lit up inside, you know? There's something about getting to the top of your field, even if it's only the bottom of the top. And the fact that I'm starting with Alfred's show, very, very gratifying. You're pretty gratifying in that get-up. Think so? Very handsome. Very distinguished. Thank you. I may be starting a new legend tonight. Mr. Mackay never seen at an opening night without two suits of clothes. I'll drop the stuff off at your apartment. Oh, Joe, you're an angel. Darling, this is Joe Positano. He's a friend of mine. Hi, mister-- [loud honking] Watch out! Oh, dear. Oh, boy. Sure got off to a flying start with him. I have a feeling there's something about you two that I should know. Well, actually, Joe's a friend of mother's. Mm-hmm. No, that's not the point. Um, well... He's written a play, and he wants you to read it. There, now you know. Look how he looks-- wounded, like a salmon caught on a hook. What are you getting yourself in an uproar for? Look, there'll come a night when you can't sleep. You'll look around for something to read, so instead of the Saturday review, you read my play. What's so terrible? Ok, Joe, you got a deal. To the theater. Right! What made me think Alfred could do a musical? What made Alfred think he could do a musical? He knows nothing about music. His analyst said it would bring gaiety into his life. His analyst ought to see an analyst. Honey, Alfred didn't make the show terrible on purpose. It seems that way when you look at it. [Telephone rings] Yes. All right, I won't be long. That's the composing room. They're waiting. Honey, look, Alfred is our best friend. Maybe I should just hold onto that and give the show a rave. No, I can't do that. I can't start off as the drama critic of this newspaper by writing a dishonest review. Alfred wouldn't want that. Would he? The first day I got the job, he said, "Larry, all I'll ever ask of you is the truth." Remember? He said it just as he finished his fourth Martini. I'm being ridiculous because Alfred's a real pro. He'll take this in his stride. Oh, darling, of course he will. Besides, you didn't say a mean word about anybody. It's the kindest way anyone ever didn't like a show. Come on... Let's drink our wine and forget it, huh? What do you want? Just a hand. Oh. Pete? Yes, Mr. Mackay? Oh, finished already? Keep the wine coming. We've had a darling day. That's too bad. Excuse me. Honey, look. Aren't they cute? Mmm. How much there is to say in the beginning, huh? Not the first couple of times I took you out. Yes, Mr. Mackay. No, Mr. Mackay. Well, I couldn't get over your being a professor, dear. Remember how shocked I was the first time you made a pass at me? Of course, secretly, I was dying for you to make it. But even so, it just didn't seem dignified... For a professor. At least it started you talking. Oh, that was big talk. Life, death... Who had the happiest childhood. Who had the unhappiest... For or against modern art, psychoanalysis, large families. Against. Ha ha! By the way, how are the kids? Impossible. That's good. [Que sera sera playing] [Humming same tune] Kate. Yes, darling. There's one more thing I want to tell you about Alfred. Oh, you are such a mood killer. ♪ Que sera sera ♪ ♪ Whatever will be, will be ♪ ♪ The future's not ours to see ♪ ♪ Que sera sera ♪ ♪ What will be, will be ♪ Let's go home. [Kate humming que sera sera] Oh, hi. I'm not complaining. I just wish you'd fall asleep in my bed sometime. I'm sorry, darling. They wake each other up. That's the trouble. Once the boys have their own rooms, things are going to be so-- oh, Larry, today's the day! What day? The real estate lady's coming by to pick us up. Now, don't forget, we're looking at houses. That's great. In the country, did you tell her? Not the chic country, the plain country, huh? Told her everything. That the boys' rooms have to be in another county, there has to be a little terrace so that we can have breakfast alone. Hey, there's a fair chance that we can do that right now. Just the two of us? I can't remember what it's like. [Dog moans] Don't you suppose you could wait just once? You think it's a chance worth taking? I'll get dressed. Maybe the boys will sleep awhile longer. Who knows? Who knows? I know. Come on, put the dish down. Morning, dad. Morning, dad. Morning, gentlemen. Where's the paper? There on the table. It's oatmeal again, dad. Can't you talk to her about it? You know what the moron said to his wife? We'll discuss oatmeal at a later date. And certainly I know what the moron said to his wife. He said, "let's have breakfast alone." That's just a silly whim. What would we talk about? Give me the cream. Please. All right. Hey. We can talk about hobo. If he doesn't find some way of walking in and out of elevators on his own four feet, he'll have to go on a diet. Kate, speaking of diets-- could we please have some real bread just once instead of this no-calorie... Darling, the stores are open to one and all. If you want it, go out and buy it. Ooh. I'm sorry. [Doorbell rings] David, see who it is, dear. [Tapping noise] George, stop kicking the table with your foot. I'm not kicking, I'm tapping. Well, then stop tapping the table with your foot. It isn't his foot, it's a fork! Just one of the kitchen forks, not a good one. Will you stop doing anything? You want us to stop eating? Oh, for heaven's sake, now pick up-- look who's here! Come sit near me! Hi, uncle Alfred! Hi, uncle Alfred! Want some oatmeal? It's good for you. Morning, George, Gabriel, Adam. Kate. Morning, friend. You're just in time for a cup of coffee. I'm glad you--uh, came over, Alfred. Now, that's a funny line. I was going to call you up, only I wanted to make sure you were up. Do you imagine I slept after this, this--betrayal? Would you please have a cup of coffee? Kate, if there's some coffee that must be drunk, for heaven's sake, drink it! I would have given my soul to have liked your play. I had to be honest, didn't I? In print, no! Not if 20 years' friendship meant anything to you. I'll be glad to discuss it with you after you calm down. All right. That seems fair. [Alfred] cokee-cola? Am I calm enough now? Alfred, before we say anything else, I swear to you, I sweated blood over that review, and your friendship means a great deal to me. Kid, if this was written by a friend, I don't need any enemies. "Whatever the theatrical season brings, "this offering must be considered its greatest disappointment." That's friendly? Oh, read the rest of it. "Because it comes from Alfred North, whose magnificent record includes..." And then I go on to list your past glories. By way of showing how low I've fallen. Well, or course you're going to misinterpret every word I wrote. You mean, there's more than one way to interpret this? "Miss Deborah Vaughn, "the star of this piece, is no actress. "It seems unnecessarily cruel to say anything more." Charming. If she'd been charming, I'd have said so! Mom, what are they so mad about? They're not mad, dear. They're having a difference of opinion. That's right, David. One of us thinks the other of us is a louse. Alfred, I think you better go. I'll go when I'm good and ready. I've every right to be here. I'm the godfather of these kiddies, their guardian if anything happens to their dear old dad. And that's not so farfetched, dear old dad. You're living pretty dangerously these days. I don't have to sit here and listen to this! Kate, listen to me objectively. You want me to take the kids to the park? Look, Kate, I am not being unreasonable. I hate Larry! Salad without dressing, rye toast without butter, and black coffee. It's crazy, isn't it, when you consider what a nice shape Mrs. Mackay got? Hey, let's double-cross her. Give her eggs Benedict, hash brown potatoes, and, um, cheesecake. She'll kill you. Not till after she's eaten. You're, um, Lawrence Mackay? Yes. I'm Deborah Vaughn. Yes, I know. Oh, good. In that case, I'm sure you'll understand. Get it? Could I have one more just to be safe? You bet your sweet life. Larry, sit down. We are not going to run and hide. Will you stop looking so guilty? I feel guilty. Oh, that poor girl. She never would have done that if she hadn't been terribly upset by my review. Oh, now, wait a minute. One slap, all right, she's upset. But two slaps? That photographer she brought didn't get the first one. Well, how do you like that? I don't. Next question. Still burning? I find I don't like having my face slapped. I don't think I'm going to like seeing pictures of it spread all over the newspapers. Honey, us broads own the world. You can't hit back at her without being a cad. I'm worse than that already. I'm a first-string critic, a sitting duck, the man you love to hate. If it's love you're looking for, I think you're in the wrong racket. I'll settle for honest hate if that's what the job brings, but a slap in the face for publicity is not honest hate. That's something you do to some poor schnook who won't hit back. I might as well serve notice right at the start. Hit me at your own risk. If they're going to treat me like Jack the ripper, I'm not going to respond like John the gent. May I? Miss Vaughn may have the last slap, but I'm going to have the last laugh. Eggs Benedict? Good morning, Alice. Are you decent? Come on in. Congratulations. Yesterday was a slack day. Nobody started a war or assassinated anybody. There was nothing to put on the front page. Nothing but you. Well, sing hallelujah like the song says. Ooh, read me the words, Alfred. With expression, please. Well, there's a description of the battle itself, biographies of the two contenders. Yours mentioning that you're 29. I have been. Then there's a column headed "he who got slapped," signed Lawrence Mackay. An apology? "I am a mild man. "I have been known to step aside "to give a caterpillar right of way. "I abhor physical violence, "especially when it is directed at me. "So, when miss Deborah Vaughn "slapped my face at Sardi's yesterday, "I abhorred it plenty. "What unmentionable thing had I done to merit such treatment?" Oh. "Well, in a recent review I said, "that miss Vaughn is no actress. That is a fact and not debatable." This next is in capital letters. Go ahead. "She cannot act. "Neither can she dance, sing, nor move scenery, "all legitimate reasons for being on a stage. "What she does do is wiggle her Fanny. Now that is also..." "This, too, justifies being on the stage. "It depends, to be blunt, on the Fanny. "When it is miss Vaughn's Fanny, "she still has no reason for being on the stage." Why, the lying slob! I'll match my Fanny against any Fanny in America! I want you to, and I'm not alone in that. We've had a busy box office since that came out. Well, well, and well! Exactly. I was going to close the show on Saturday, but I can't now. Not as long as the public insists upon making up its own mind about your Fanny. Here you are again, third week running. This time they call you ex-gentle, ex-genial, ex-professor Lawrence Mackay. They cut down trees for paper to print that? [Telephone rings] The desk of Lawrence Mackay. Who's calling, please? Mr. Perkins. Your publisher? Tell him I'll call him tomorrow. Mr. Mackay will call you tomorrow. He's busy editing a poison-pen column. Are you writing a book on all this jazz? No, I'm writing a book called presentations of dramatic art. Until all this jazz, nobody seemed to care. Darling? How is the most ravishing woman on 62nd street? Angel! It's my son-in-law, Lawrence Mackay, the critic, the one who got slapped. No, dear, she isn't here yet. All right, sweetie, I'll tell her. An absolute darling and brilliant. Mrs. Robinson, Jeremy seems depressed. Jeremy resented being bathed, and he's looking for sympathy. Oh. Just ignore it. Oh, thank you. Grandma! Hi, grandma! We've got a deal for you! We'll explain it. Say you'll say yes! Quiet, everybody, give grandma a chance. Kate, when I want quiet, I'll ask for it. Now, what is the deal? George and I need a new turtle. On account of ours got swept in the vacuum, and Gabe needs a new angelfish. On account of my own got et. But on the allowance we get, we can't save enough money, so we thought maybe you'd let us pay for it by working. Fair enough. Here, first you can feed the fish. Now divide that up. Come on, Sonny boy, come on. Oh-oh! Ah! Did you see Hector? There's your friend, sweetheart. Hector, say hello to Adam. [Bird talks] [Adam] no-no? Oh, he's learned a new word! Making a grand total of two! Mmm, my big boy. Gabriel, don't get too close to that monkey. He squirts. When you were his age, all you could say was daddy. Shh, keep it quiet, will you? Speaking of daddy... Oh, Larry called. He'll meet you at the party. Who's giving this one? Mona James. The actress? Mm-hmm. It's only our fourth this week. I'm rapidly turning into a big, fat, soggy hors d'oeuvre. Hey, what's with this mutt anyway? I had to park a block away. You think he'd walk? Not on your life. He's very badly trained, Joe. Now don't look at me. He's Larry's dog. Well, he's with you more. Oh, I can't win. Listen, mother. Joe will take me to the party and come back and drive you and the boys to the apartment, ok? All right. Have a nice time. Boys, come into my office. Front and center. Listen, grandma's doing me a big favor by taking care of you, so-- aw, she likes it. Never mind, "she likes it." Just don't make it a night to remember. Ok. Ok. Don't forget to have the doorman take hobo out. Where's hobo? Hobo! Hobo. Hobo. Adam! Hobo, where are you? Daddy? Of course, there are interesting failures, there are prestige failures, and there are financial failures, but this is the sort of failure that gives failures a bad name. Ha ha ha ha! Oh, Mona. Oh, Kate! Kate, darling. I want you to meet Jane march. How do you do? Mr. Mackay, I've been longing to meet you. She writes plays. Kate, sometimes I loathe the theater. The lying, the buttering. If I had a simple life like yours, Kate, with those wonderful kids. How many are there by now, darling? I lose track, you're at it so often. Just four. The girls are twins, aren't they? The girls? Yes, Lana and... George, darling! You need a drink! Oh, angel, I must go and host. George, I'm so glad to see you. [Playing piano] Hello there. Hello. I've been watching you, hoping you'd come over. You have? Mm-hmm. You don't belong in this room full of spooks. Shh. You're young, alive, beautiful. Oh, come on. What are you, uh, doing later? Thanks anyway, Sonny. No dice? Not a one. In that case, would you mind moving and giving somebody else a chance? It's a pleasure. Good luck. Thanks. I bet you thought I'd forgotten you. Darling, it isn't gin I need. It's a nice thick, juicy steak with French fried potatoes. You do have a show to cover, you know? There you are, you darling man. I was terrified you'd gone without telling me what to do with my third act. Have you met my wife? How do you do? You will let me have him for a moment, won't you, dear? He's going to tell me what to do with my third act. Go ahead, honey. Tell her what to do with her third act. Now then, darling, I have a problem. Excuse me. Oh! Hello. Would you please get up off of me? For heaven's sake. Mona? Will you put this out for me, darling. Mona? Mona? Yes, dear. I think your dog ate one of my earrings. Oh, it's so small. I don't think it will do her any harm. Be my guest, chum. Larry, darling, someone here to see you. [Music stops] Dear Mr. Mackay, don't be frightened. I have come not to slap, but to forgive. [Crowd reacts] I insist on turning the other cheek. All right. [Crowd laughs and applauds] Now that the smoke of battle has cleared, may I ask a question? Are you flexible enough to reconsider a perhaps hastily formed opinion? I think so. I hope so. Good. I was wrong. Thank you. Alfred. What are you doing in here? Reading about the mad Mackays in the columns. Cocktail parties left and right, among those seen at El Morocco. A far cry from the simple souls I once knew. I'll bet Larry's loving this whole megillah. Now, why shouldn't he love it? You know how shy and unpushy he's always been. Why shouldn't he enjoy a little flurry? Little flurry? Listen, Kate, your own true love has set his foot on the first step of the downalator. The what? Opposite number of the escalator, the downalator. The one that leads to the place where all bad critics go. For a critic, that first step is his first printed joke. People laugh. A whole new world opens up. He makes another joke, and another. Then one day, along comes a joke that shouldn't be made because the show he's reviewing is a good show, but the joke happens to be a good joke.
