Move! Move! It's a murder, sir. Yes, sir. No idea. Okay, sir. He is Simhadri Naidu. There is a monster in every era. He's the demon Bakasur for Kurnool. He makes Kurnool quake in fear with just a look. He tortures people with the support of politicians. That's how he turned into a financial power. Simhadri Naidu's goal is to loot billions of rupees.. ..and become an invincible political power. Anybody that stands against him tastes death. Good morning, sir. There was a murder at Kondareddy Fort. Yes, sir. File a case that Varalaxmi committed the murder. But she didn't commit that murder. She has a good name with people. We need solid evidence to file a case against her. Then create solid evidence. Got it, sir. Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! She is Varalaxmi Devi. A successful industrialist in Kurnool district. Varalaxmi knows no failures in business, only successes. Every time people are faced with a problem.. ..they look to Varalaxmi for a solution. Everyone receives help from her in one way or the other. Everyone joins their hands in respect before her. Simhadri Naidu is afraid that Varalaxmi's.. ..growing popularity will be a political obstacle for him. That's why he framed her in this murder case. Varalaxmi! I did nothing wrong. Justice is on my side. No harm will come to me as long as I have your support. Let the police do their duty. - This is unfair, dear. - I'll be fine, Mom. Police! Down, down! Police! Down, down! Move! Give way! This is injustice! Move! I'll do that right away. - Bhavani! - Yes, ma'am. Arrange for me to meet the lawyer right now. Okay, ma'am. Hello, madam! Hello! Don't worry. I heard what happened. Every person in this district, including me.. ..knows how good Varalaxmi madam is. It is my responsibility to prove her innocence. The man who died, Bhupal.. ..joined as my daughter's PA three months ago. Someone murdered him last night. I'm sure someone is trying to falsely frame my daughter. Please save her. Don't worry. There is no other lawyer in Kurnool.. ..that can get Varalaxmi out of this mess. Tenali Ramakrishna. BA. BL. Upto 50% off on every case. 100% cash-back if the case is lost. Please give me cases. Give me one case, I will fight the second one for free. - Tenali! - Yes? Even South India Shopping Mall doesn't have.. ..so many offers. I know you are smarter than me. Even I get a few cases, why don't you get any? Our innocent public doesn't know the.. ..difference between valuable and worthless things. So, it will take some time for them to understand it. My time will come. Why are you so confident? Did you get a case? - Yeah. - Which one? The case of water pots. You are talking as if it's the case of buried treasures. A mighty mango tree grows from a humble mango seed. But some seeds remain seeds forever. I have a strong feeling that you are going to get hurt. Be careful. Okay. Here comes my client. Oh no! Why did he stop there? Oh no, he saw me. He's leaving. Sir! Sir! Sir! Why are you running away.. ..like Vijay Mallya runs from bank authorities? We should file the case today. I hired another lawyer. Why did you do that? I changed my decision while taking bath this morning. It's not underwear to change every time you take bath. And you don't look like a man who wears underwear. Who is this man? He looks blacker than the black coat. - Is he a peon here? - How dare you! Calm down. Let me handle it. Sir, don't underestimate me because I'm young. Nobody can beat me in an argument. When I talk about law points.. ..the opponent will pee in his pants. Once I step inside the court hall, the judge.. ..has no option but to give the verdict in my favor. I don't want you. Don't worry about the fee. My friend has many offers. If you give him one case.. ..he'll fight the second case free of charge. If you use Paytm to pay him.. ..I have 50% cash-back offer. And if he loses the case.. ..I've 100% cash-back offer. Maybe that's why you don't have any cases. - You'll definitely win. - Thank you. Since you refused to give this case to Tenali Ramakrishna.. ..you'll definitely win. You should never give a car to someone who can't drive.. ..and a case to someone who can't prove a point. Meet this lawyer. He is Gutti Gurunadham. - Hello. - Hello. He's the perfect lawyer for your case. I trust you, so I'll entrust my case to him.. ..instead of giving it to Tenali. You'll have to pay 4,000 as a fee to fight your case. Of course. Please come to my office in the evening. Okay. See you later. - Raju! - Yes? Don't tell anyone that I made you take your case back from Tenali. Why will I tell anyone? Good. My commission is 2,000 rupees. He paid me 4,000 and you want 2,000 as commission? Yes. I think brokers are earning more than lawyers. Don't call me a broker. It sounds cheap. Just call me bro. Whatever. Here, take 500 rupees. Just 500? Even beggars will not accept it. It's more than you deserve. What a useless life! I've a bad headache. Order a cup of strong tea. Okay? When will I get cases? When will I win them? When will I be a successful lawyer? "A delicate flower petal has slit my throat" "A sweet drop of milk has drowned me" "This euphoric feeling is new to me" "This magic is strange to me" Hello! Excuse me! Wow! "A delicate flower petal has slit my throat" "A sweet drop of milk has drowned me" Just a few seconds. I'll see you and go away. What? I'm sure God added some medicine to your face. When I look at you my whole body de-stresses.. ..as if all the pending cases in the court were given verdicts. Hello, mister! What do you think of us? She looks like a juicy hybrid tomato. What about me? You look like a gluttonous customer.. ..waiting to receive a food parcel from Zomato. Hello! You know nothing about me. I've a goal, a life ambition. I want to win one case after another, one after another.. ..and become a Lady Ram Jethmalani. - Right? - Right. You too. Stop flirting with girls and try to be a good lawyer. Okay? Bye, mister! Don't call me mister. I'm Tenali Ramakrishna. BA. BL. I don't flirt with all girls. Just you. Savitri! I heard that your son doesn't have a single case. Why are you always talking bad about my brother? I just asked because that's what everyone is saying. Does your son really need a lawyer's job? What do you mean by that? We know how hard my father worked to make him a lawyer. You'll see. My brother will be very successful very soon. Mom, wait. You don't have to carry it. Come on. What about your scooter? Who will take it? I'll be right back. Love you. Did you get any case? No, Mom. I suspect that some idiot is conspiring against me. Every case I find just slips through my fingers. Coming, going. Coming, going. The idiot who's conspiring against you.. ..should fall into a manhole while walking on the road. - That's my curse. He should die. - Don't worry, Mom. A man is going to give me a case tomorrow. Nobody else knows about it. Let me see which idiot takes it away from me. I'm hungry. Let's go home. It's a waste of time to give your case to him. Giving your case to Tenali.. ..is like losing a match even before you toss the coin. Now tell me. Will you give your case.. ..to Tenali Ramakrishna or Piduguralla Subbarao? After you've advised me like Lord Krishna.. ..why will I give my case to Tenali? - I'll give it to Piduguralla sir. - I'm leaving. Sir! Sir! You'll definitely win the case. When did he come here? Did he hear me? - He's back. - So what? Dad! Dad! He can hear you. Go on. I've heard about people who ruin.. ..friendships and marriages. But I've never heard about a father.. ..who conspires against his son to take away his cases. Are you my real father? So, he's the one who's been chasing people away? Yes. So, the one who I cursed the other day.. Your husband, Your Honor. Oh my God! Please cancel the request. Don't act as if you have the best of cases. Someone lost the bell on his bicycle. Someone lost the fuel in his scooter. A hero's fans tore the posters of another hero. What kind of cases are they? Why do they need lawyers? - How should a lawyer be? - He should be like a lawyer. Shut your mouth. He should be a powerful person. When Tenali Ramakrishna takes up a case.. ..the opposite person should accept his defeat. That's how a lawyer should be. Right. How should a father be? He should leave his son lots of wealth. What did you give me? This black coat.. ..and that rickety scooter. What? I'm a rickety scooter? Sorry, darling. It was a slip of the tongue. Don't be upset. Yes. Since I named you Tenali Ramakrishna.. ..at least try to become a good lawyer. Is that so? I can be a lawyer with lots of cases and lots of money too. Tell him that. He's always just talking about earning respect. And tell him to cut down on his alcohol. He'll fall sick. We are done. Will you have a peg? No! I'm not a rebellious son who drinks before his father. I'll drink in my room. Give it to me. So the villain in your story is your own father? Yes. He says that the cases we get are petty cases. He wants me to take up big cases and become famous. Whenever I think about my father.. ..my blood pressure raises, raises, raises.. Down, down, down. There's some magic in that girl. Whenever I see her, I calm down instantly. Let's go. Hi! What? Are you stressed out again? Yes. If you give me a smile, I'll see it and go away. No need of that. Press this, your stress will be gone. No way. This ball treatment won't work on him. Look, Mr. Lawyer! I told you my goal, my life ambition. I want to win one case after another, one after another.. But what if you don't get a chance to win a case? Shut up. Let her talk. Continue. I have deep knowledge about all the sections. Very good. Very good. Seenu, you've many doubts about sections, right? Ask madam about them. Okay. Please tell me about Section 302. That's an important section. Tell me about Section 506. That's another section. Section 5.. Why? This is an easy one. Tell him about Section 420. That's another section. She's very dense. Just like the government gives.. ..free houses to poor ones.. ..someone gave her a free lawyer's certificate. It's okay. I'll adjust. Any objection? Objection overruled. I don't have any objection. With your intelligence, you can easily become a judge. A judge? You've lost your judgment. Get lost. Ignore him. Move! You will win one case after another, one after another.. ..and become a successful lawyer. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Wow! Please do something about Janakiram's case.. Hello, sir. Giri! How are you doing? What is the status of our case? Our case? It's still in court. Even if the sun turns into the moon, or the moon turns into the sun, that Sampangi Seenu shouldn't win. I don't care how much money it costs me, I've to win it. Keep up regular payments for every hearing.. ..I'll make sure that he bites the dust. Mr. Seenu, once a man hires a lawyer.. ..he has to sell all his property. He has to sell it too. - Don't worry. - See you later. - Sir! - We'll win! What's up, Ashok? What did your client say? My client repeats the same thing that your client says. The lawyer is continuously asking for his fee. I better pay him. It is about my honor, after all. This case started when K.C.R demanded for Telangana. He became our CM twice till now.. ..but we are still managing to keep that case in court. - I wonder where he is. - Let's keep it going the same way. I bought a site in Amaravati with the fee he pays me. There's another one as well, we both can share it. "Betrayal.." - Generally.. - "Deception.." Giri! I as discussing our case. - Did you bring my fee? - I did. Where is it? Blood. I broke your head, of course you'll bleed. Did you expect Rakul Preet Singh instead? Stop! I'll break your skull! Stop! Wait. Tenali! Why did you come to court with tomato sauce on your head? - Tomato sauce? - Yes. Don't be so cruel. This is my blood. Stop him. Stop him. Or, he'll kill me. He'll kill me. - I'll break his skull. - Stop, please. - The vultures should feed on his brain. - Stop him. Did he hit you? Stop it! Stop him. Friend, tell me what your problem is. Sir, he is Sampangi Seenu. He said he knows Boyapati Seenu and.. ..took 20 million from me for his dates. Boyapati Seenu? Start camera. That's him, right? Action! What happened next? Forget Boyapati Seenu, he doesn't even know Chitra Seenu. When I asked him for money, he gave me a cheque. Do you know whose sign was on it? Nara Lokesh's sign. I hired this lawyer to deal with this case. This lawyer and that lawyer joined hands.. ..and have been looting me for the past five years. That's why I broke his head. Sampangi Seenu. Yes. Hold this. - Are you ready? - Yes, I'm ready. Let's go. - Sampangi. - Yes, sir? - What did you do with his money? - I bought two acres of land. Wow! You are an intelligent boy. What's the value of that land now? 40 million. Then do one thing. Give him one acre land. I'll ask him to withdraw the case. You'll have 20 million profit without spending a paisa. I won't give him a single rupee. Listen! My client is very frustrated right now. What if he kills you? Do you think he'll do that? Maybe I'll advise him to kill you and defend his case. That way I'll have a case on my hands. Really? Yes. Good boy. Come with me. I'll skin him alive. Hold this. - Are you ready? - Yes, I'm ready. - Let's talk. - Okay. Listen, I had a talk with him. He's ready to give you your 20 million back. Withdraw the case. No way! I will make him pay interest.. ..simple interest, compound interest for my 20 million. - What if he files an IP? - What will I do? You'll be left with nothing. I've a brilliant idea to avoid all these problems. What's that? Compromise. Make a deal with him. A man who compromises is greater than a king. So I'm a king? You are greater than a king. - Wow. - Come on. - This sounds good. - Now you hold this. Are you ready? Action! - Okay, I'll let it go. - That's it. If you fight in the court, only one of you will win. But if you compromise, you both will win. I realize that now. My family and I will be grateful to you. Whenever you need my help, I'll be here for you. Thank you. Me too. I'll be ready to serve you. Thank you. You can go now. Can you get me the dates of hero Vinayak? Seenu, I realized something great today. What's that? Let's take over all the pending cases in the court. Let's help everyone to come to a compromise. Compromise. This is Tenali's style. "Ramakrishna Tenali.." "Just do as I say" "Then your life will be a cozy vacation in Kulu Manali" "You can take a step up when you have to" "You should take a step down when you need to" "Try compromise and your life will be a celebration" "You'll be a king, brother" "Ramakrishna Tenali.." "Just do as I say" "Then your life will be a cozy vacation in Kulu Manali" (Shlokas) (Shlokas) (Shlokas) (Shlokas) "Wars compromise, scuffles compromise" "Love failures compromise, 370 compromise" "Compromise, compromise.. Just compromise" "If they had given away five villages.." "..there wouldn't have been Kurukshetra war in history" "If Ravan had compromised.." "..Lanka would've been saved and continued to exist" "Even in the biggest fights of friendship.." "..property disputes between siblings.." "..compromise is the kingly route to take" "Do it right and your life will be bright" "Ramakrishna Tenali.." "Just do as I say" "Then your life will be a cozy vacation in Kulu Manali" "Ramakrishna" "Ramakrishna" "Ramakrishna Tenali" "Compromise, compromise, come to a compromise" Look! Money is growing on trees in our garden! What? Did I throw money on the trees when I'm drunk? Wait, I'll shake them. Gather all the money. Excuse me! The trees didn't grow that money.. ..your son earned it. I told you that my darling son will earn millions one day. I would've been happy if he earned some respect too. What do you mean? You can earn only money by making compromises. But if you fight a good case, you'll earn respect too. What does he want? You mean respect is greater than money? Yes. It is greater than money. Since I'm a broker, everyone calls your mother a broker's wife. Everyone in this colony views my kids as a broker's children. I thought you'll earn respect by becoming a good lawyer.. ..and that will help our whole family to be respected. That's why I want my son to be a successful lawyer. What's wrong in that? Tell me. (Prayer Song) - Dear! - Hmm? What did you ask God? I demanded him to make me a famous judge. You shouldn't demand God, you should request him. Remember that when you pray next time. Why don't you hire her as your assistant lawyer? As soon as she wins a case with her own capability.. ..I'll give my practice to her. Okay. Wait here, I'll bring the car. Why is the break not working? Move! Move out of the way! The break is not working! Move! Move out of the way! Madam, please move! Sir! Sir, move! Stop the scooter! - I can't even if I want to. - Why? The break failed! Why is your father leaving on a scooter without us? He's not leaving on a scooter. He's hit by a scooter. Oh no! Looks like he's been hit at the wrong place! Why are you talking so much to the neighbor? My sari! Leave it! My wife! My wife! - Somebody save me! - Save my wife! - I'll help you! - I'll help her! My sari! Oh God! My sari! - Don't worry, I'm here for you. - Thank you. Stop the scooter. - Don't worry, I'll help you. - Help me! Help me! - My sari! - Help! Help! Stop him! Stop him! Stop! - Thank you. Thank you very much. - My wife! Get your hands off my wife! Let her go! Excuse me! Sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry, sister. I used your sari because of unavoidable circumstances. I'm just like your brother. A brother buys saris for his sister. He doesn't pull the one she's wearing. You are not a brother. I don't agree. Shut up! If he's not a brother, is he a lover? Let's go home. I'll spare you because of your age. Mind it. How dare you talk to me like that? Are you okay? You got hit in the center. Is it safe? Shut up! Don't announce it to the whole world.. ..that I got hit in the center. Dad! Are you okay? Hi! Stupid fellow. - Let's go home, Dad. - Careful. Rukmini! I'm very sorry. If you want, I'll write.. ..the word sorry ten million times for hurting your father. You don't have to write sorry ten million times. You'll hit someone else with a scooter with failed breaks. - Rukmini! - What? I, Tenali Ramakrishna BA BL take an oath on.. ..Bhagavad Gita that I won't hit your father.. ..or anybody's father with my scooter with failed breaks. Please. Whatever. I don't believe you. Rukmini! Hey! If I cross your path, you will be at risk. If you cross my path, you will be at risk. I'll crush you. Hello, madam! You said the court hearing is tomorrow. Will my daughter get a bail? My word is like a Supreme Court verdict. Varalaxmi will definitely get a bail tomorrow. Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Seenu, why is the court so chaotic today? It is Varalaxmi madam's first hearing today. That's why there are so many people here. Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Long live Varalaxmi! Proceed. Yes, Your Honor. She's not just a respectable woman. She's a very influential and dangerous woman too. She's a murderess, Your Honor. I object, Your Honor. I'd request my friend here to kindly withdraw.. ..the term murderess. And Your Honor, my client is a respectable and responsible citizen. Lots of families depend on her. Whenever the court needs, I'll make sure she'll be here. So, I once again request, Your Honor.. ..to kindly grant her bail, that's all. Varalaxmi has been granted bail with.. ..200,000 rupees as security. If we can manage to get one case like this.. You'll definitely lose. They say a black cat crossing your path is a bad omen. I don't know why I keep you around me. Wait and see. I will get a case that will turn my life around. People like us send servants to buy vegetables. They don't come to the market as if it's a picnic spot. Why did the break fail again? What's the price of this musk melon? Sir, move out of the way! Madam! Madam! Oh no! Please move! He's racing towards us like a bull! Move, please! If he hits me, my 'lungi' will come off! The break failed! Move, sir! Move! Move! Oh no! Mom! - Mom! - Did she die? - Dad! - Oh, we should save her. Help! Help! Stop the cart! Please help me! I'm coming. Help! Hurry up! Stop it. Oh God! Your weight added to the weight of the fruits. - I almost died. - What's the price of this musk melon? How do I look? Like a fruit seller. Stupid. Shut up. I'm a criminal lawyer. Go away. You look like a crazy man. Mom! Mom! Leave that basket. - Are you okay? - I'm sorry. I didn't know that the brake failed again. I didn't do it on purpose. Tenali! You hit my Dad and Mom with your scooter. I'm the only one in my family that's left. Ram into me! Come on! Do it if you are a real man! - No, please. - Come on! Do it! Ram into me! - Oh God! - I'm sorry. Don't you have any sense? Will you ram into a girl if she asks you to do it? Sir, I thought she'll be upset if I don't do it.. ..after she asked me so many times. - You! - Dad, leave him to me. I'll deal with you. I'll make you pay for this. Under sections 702, 506 and 103, I'll file.. ..one case after another, one case after another.. ..and put you behind bars. That's Rukmini for you. Let's go, Dad. Let's go, dear. Come on. Sir, she quoted all wrong sections. Teach her. Get lost! We know all the correct sections! Hey! "Her soft eyes are pricking my heart like thorns" "She's a soft beauty with a fiery temper" (Shlokas) (Shlokas) "Are you a sharp sickle or a hot chili?" "Are you a sharp sickle or a hot chili?" "Have mercy on me" "Are you a formidable fort or a delicious sweet?" "Will you keep tempting me?" "You look inviting like a juicy tomato" "But you explode like a bomb when I touch you" "My heart is threatening me.." "..that it will stop beating if I don't love you" "Are you the prettiest girl in this district?" "Will you make me chase you?" "Are you very stingy? Won't you give me a small kiss?" "You follow us in the name of love" "You torture us when we say no" "When we give in and fall in love, you freak out" "After that you slowly slide away" "You disturb all night in my dreams" "But you ignore me in the morning" "There are diamonds hidden in this land" "You are my diamond, let me find you" "You are like golden wheat ready for harvest" "Let me harvest you with my sharp eyes" "I'll marry you, become my wife" "I want only you, or I'll die" "I want only you, or I'll die" "Sharp sickle.. Sharp sickle.." (Shlokas) (Shlokas) Here, drink it while it's hot. What's this? I asked for coffee. Why can't you drink tea? Okay, I'll drink it. If I ask for biscuits, you might give me dog food. Sure. I'll give you whatever you want. Tomorrow I'll go out and buy some dog food. Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! - Hi, dear. - Hi, dear. Hi, darling. God added some magic in your face. Whenever I see you, all my anger and frustration is gone. I'm sure God added some medicine to your face. When I look at you my whole body de-stresses. Even the headache caused by my wife. You mean I'm a headache? Not just headache, neck pain, chest pain, leg pain.. ..joint pains, all the pains are caused by a wife. Did I leave anything out? I wish you experienced birth pains too. Then you would've understood a wife's agony. I can win an argument in the court.. ..but can't argue with a wife. Even if lose my senses and argue, I know I won't win it. Relax, Mom! Relax, Dad! I'll go for a jog. - Okay, carry on. - Bye. Bye. Swetha! Tenali is right. My eyes have magical powers. Right. How can you believe that stupid man's words? No. My Dad said the same thing. Oh God! Why did she call now? - Listen.. - What is it? You've to come home and cook food tonight. You watch TV all day, go for kitty parties and shopping. Did you ever make a cup of tea for me? Did you give me a massage after a tiring day? On our wedding day, when I touched your feet.. ..you said that I sprained your ankle. Whenever I touch anything, you say I sprained it. Don't provoke me. If you don't cook tonight.. ..I won't let you come into the bedroom. If I want, I can sleep in three different bedrooms in a day. If you talk like that I'll go to my mother's house. Are you threatening me? Go ahead. Go. I'm waiting. Uncle! What? What do you want? Are you under stress? No. I'm in a city bus. Come, let's go together. Don't be upset. I'll help you to forget your stress. How? Just look into my eyes for a few seconds. Your stress will disappear. How do you feel now after looking into my eyes? I feel like pulling your eyes out. We men experience stress because of women. If you stay here any longer.. ..you'll be subjected to my anger caused by my wife. Go away. I'll do Venky Aasan. Tenali! There's a simple civil case. I'm sure you can bring about a compromise.. ..because the crucial point in this case is.. Rukmini! Do you want coffee or tea? How do you know that I'm here? If you gamble, you'll lose money. If you drink alcohol, you'll lose your kidneys. When you are around me, I lose all my stress. You are an idiot! You are.. No abuses. You told me your stress goes away when you look into my eyes. One uncle was in stress and I showed him. What did you show him? I showed him my eyes. My eyes. I see. But he said he'll pull out my eyes. You can't relieve everyone from stress. When I look at you, all my stress goes away. Who knows? Maybe after a few days.. ..your stress will disappear when you look at me. That would be amazing. Will you try it? Please. Just once. Let's go. Tell me. What's the problem? She became the second wife of my husband. He said he's unmarried and dated me. But, the dating resulted in voting. That's not voting, it's cross-voting. Let me talk. Mr. Prasad, what do you want to do? I'm okay with both of them. Is it? We are talking about wives, not children. The court won't agree to it. Then how do we solve this problem? Spend three days with her and three days with her. What about Sunday? Spend it with us. Be in peace. I won't let her live in peace. I don't care if my life is ruined, I won't let him be with her. I don't care if my life is ruined, I won't let you be happy. - I won't agree to it. - I will never agree. Calm down! - Ramakoti! - Yes, sir? What's happening there? He is Tenali Ramakrishna. He helps the pending cases come to a compromise. His father Durga Rao gives false witness in cases. A man who can't win learns to live with compromises. Waste fellow. Worst fellow. Let's not go that way. Come on. Look, Mr. Prasad. You can't live with another woman after you get married. They will put you behind bars. I thought it will be fun to have two wives. I never thought that all the fun will be sucked out of my life. Do one thing. Promise that you'll give 10 million rupees.. ..to the one that withdraws the case. What? Is there a settlement for living in as well? Living in and settlements are in fashion nowadays. Living in and settlement. Living in and settlement. It's an ugly, dirty, consecutive process. Right. Okay, then. Let's go. Listen, whoever agrees for a compromise.. ..will get 10 million rupees. Okay, I'm willing to do it for 10 million rupees. Even I'm willing to do it for 10 million rupees. Wow! You are willing to leave your husband for 10 million. Anyone of you has children? I have a daughter. Whether you like it or not, your daughter needs a father. So, you should be with your husband. Since you've faced injustice, take the 10 million rupees.. ..and withdraw the case. If possible, don't get into any live-in relationships.. ..and live peacefully. Let's go. Okay. Why did you bring me here? I'm going to bring about a compromise in a case.. ..like Tenali Ramakrishna. Really? Are you as clever as Tenali? If you think Tenali is clever.. ..what should I call the brilliant brains that I have? Wait here, I'll be right back. Wait, I'll come with you. No need. I already called him, he asked me to come alone. Yes, you are right. Hi! Wow, sir! You are drinking during the day. Anything special? Your coming here is special. So, what's the matter? You married a woman to be your second wife and then abandoned her. She filed a case against you. It is wrong to deceive a girl. So I came here to suggest a compromise. And what do you suggest? You have 20 acres of land at Kurnool's outskirts. Give that to her. Give her 50 million for her expenses. I'll make sure that she agrees to this compromise. - Guys! - Yes, boss? - Leave us alone for some time. - Okay, boss. Let them be here. I don't mind. I don't want to rape you in front of everyone. Sir! There will be a big issue if you harm me in any way. But you'll help us to reach a compromise. Come on! Oh God! Why is the liquor so strong? You'll damage your kidneys if you drink this. Go add some water to it. Do you know how long I've been searching for you? Anyway, give me a smile, all my stress will disappear. It's alright, give me a smile. Give me a smile. Why isn't she smiling? Give me a smile. Sorry, man. My stress increases when she doesn't smile. Give me one smile. Please, just one smile. A small one. Oh no, I think I hit you too hard. Okay, don't smile for me. At least smile for them. Sister, I beg of you. Please, I beg of you. He is killing us. Please give him a smile. Madam, please smile. Or, he will kill all of us. Do you want me to smile? My wife fell in love with me because of my smile. Madam smiled. She smiled. Thanks, madam. We are leaving. She smiled. Bye, sir. Bye. I should hit you. Have you lost your mind? Why told you to come here? You are not clever, you are good, that's it. What will I do if something happens to you? What will my parents do? You can try to bring about a compromise in civil cases.. ..not in criminal cases. He's not just someone who married a second time. He's accused of murder and rape too. What compromise can you.. Criminals must be punished. Got it? Come on. Let's go. Tenali! Hi! Usually whenever I see you, all my stress disappears. But for some strange reason, my stress is increasing now. Why? I don't know. Can I tell you something? Sure. I love you. Sir, did you see this video? A girl kissed her lover in front of her father. Take a look. See the way she kissed him. See it. It's a nice video. Why are you hitting me? Give me 5,000 rupees. I'm in need of money. What? I gave you 2,000 rupees just a few days ago. Bring me some cases, then I'll pay you. Sir! Chakravarthi sir is calling me. - Okay, go on. - I'm coming. Hello, sir! Your name.. I'm Durga Rao. My son's name is Tenali Ramakrishna. He's a lawyer in this court. I wish he becomes a great lawyer like you. A sparrow and an eagle fly in the sky.. ..but they can never be the same. Just because your son is a lawyer.. ..he's not equal to me. No. You used to come in as a false witness, right? Yes, sir. Now you help small lawyers to get small cases.. ..and take commission from them. That means you still work as a broker, right? Wait, I've another doubt. Is it just you in the family.. ..or do your wife and children work as brokers too? Hey! Did my words anger you? What is my fault? Why did you hit me? How angry should I be when your son.. ..is trying to trap my daughter, you bloody.. Your whole family sleeps in one room under one fan.. ..to save on electricity bill by not using two fans. My family installs AC even in the dog's room. A broker's son will become a broker. That's why he's continuing your broker legacy.. ..by helping people to come to a compromise. Tell your son to stay away from my daughter. That way he'll live longer. I don't want to kill your son. But if he wants to die, I don't mind doing it. Dad! Dad! You are always talking about respect, right? I brought you well respected alcohol. To my Dad, with love. What? Are you worried that it's too expensive? All the rich people drink it. Tell him. Why does everyone look so disturbed? I thought you'll help me gain respect. But I've lost it. How angry should I be, you bloody.. Your whole family sleeps in one room under one fan.. Tenali, wait. A broker's son will become a broker. It's a beautiful orchard. Someone gifted it to my Dad. Oh, wow. Hi, Tenali. Rukmini! Where is your father? He's in a mango orchard near Bangalore Highway. I'm coming there right now. Tenali is coming. You can go home. There's nobody else here. Take care. I don't want anyone else to be here. Just go. Okay, okay. Tenali! Where's your father? He's not here. Then why did you call me here? To show you this orchard. Who wants to see this stupid orchard? Where is your father? Dad! The whole world sees me as Varalaxmi's lawyer. But only this mango orchard knows that I'm your lawyer. As soon as you got to know that a journalist is murdered.. ..you came up with a brilliant plan. Frame Varalaxmi in the murder case. I will be her lawyer and make sure that she gets locked up. You made me file a case and gave me your lawyer. Then you created two false witnesses to say.. ..that Varalaxmi committed the murder. Poor Varalaxmi. She thinks she's going to win.. ..when she has defeat right beside her. You are right. Our criminal lawyer won't let her win. I'll make sure that Varalaxmi gets locked up. The whole of Kurnool will be under your control. That's why I gifted you this 70 acre orchard. If we want to win this case.. ..you and your wife are crucial as the eye witnesses. The judge should believe your lies. That's very important. Ashok Kumar will present a strong case.. ..to make sure that Varalaxmi gets a prison sentence. Though I know everything I'll act innocent and.. ..stand there shell-shocked. Before Varalaxmi realizes what's happening in court.. ..she'll be given a sentence. Case over. File close. Why are all the criminals of Kurnool gathered here? Rukmini! Come here. I've lost respect for you, Dad. You framed an innocent lady for a mango orchard? And you think you can talk about my family? Yes, my Dad is a broker, but he's not corrupt like you. Yes, our whole family sleeps under one fan.. ..but we can't do despicable deeds to buy ACs like you. We won't be able to sleep in peace. You said something else too. Yes. A broker's son will become a broker. That's why your son is living by creating compromises. Sir! I don't want your pathetic capability. Tenali! You have to hear it. Hear it. It's okay if criminals like you are free to roam outside. But a good-hearted woman like Varalaxmi Devi.. ..shouldn't be locked up, Tenali won't let that happen. His maturity levels are very low. Sir, I think you'll have another murder case on hands. Whose murder? Maybe Naidu sir will kill Tenali Ramakrishna BA BL. Go kill him. Why are you going alone as if walking into an interview? All of you, go! Hit him! Surround him and hit him. You eat lots of 'Biryani' every day.. ..and drink a full bottle every night. Go kill him. Oh God! Rukmini, come on! Rukmini, I'll break your legs if you go with him. Mr. Lawyer! Your daughter is mine and your case is mine. You've only seen me trying to make compromises till now.. ..but there won't be any compromise with this case. Rukku.. ..hop on. Good morning, ma'am! Please come. Have a seat. Thank you. Ma'am, just before I start, I've a small doubt. Did a lawyer named Tenali Ramakrishna meet you? No. Who is he? Just like a tissue paper. Not important. So, coming to your case, ma'am.. We are going to win, right? No, we are going to lose. What? We'll lose on purpose. Why should we lose? You can use this case to your advantage. How? I'll lose the case in the court, the police will arrest you. You'll tell the media that they framed you in a false case.. ..because you are a threat to their political ambitions.. ..and that they are jealous of your increasing popularity. We'll get some channels and newspapers on our side.. ..and spread this news. People's sympathy for you will increase like the prices of gold. I'll get a bail for you in six months. As soon as you come out of prison.. ..you'll contest for MP's post. You'll win with majority. You think I'll have a political career after going to prison? If you go to jail, your political career will be strong.. ..like a wall built with Nagarjuna Cement. Trust me. Okay. I trust you. Tell me. Varalaxmi will confess in the court that.. ..she murdered that man and will go to prison. Tenali shouldn't come to the court at any cost. Be careful. He won't come. I won't let him come. Wait a minute. Allow us to cross the road. Seenu, where is Tenali? He said he'll be here by 9 o' clock. Once the cross-examination is done.. ..they'll arrest Varalaxmi. Time is up. Why hasn't the judge come yet? He goes to the temple every day before coming to court. What's the matter? Why do you look worried? Nothing, ma'am. I just want the cross-examination to be over. Actually, he's never late. Why today.. Bring the car. I'm getting late for court. Okay, sir. Call him. Come on, hurry up. I'm not able to reach him. What do we do now? Naidu sir! The judge's car is here. We'll win the case and Varalaxmi will go to prison. Be happy. Don't worry. Hey, Ayomayam! What are you muttering? Where is the judge? Judge sir never saw me like a driver. - He treated me like his cousin. - Where is he? Somebody kidnapped him. He was so good to me. I'm not able to reach him. What do we do now? Tenali already told me what we should do.. ..if he doesn't come to the court. If I don't reach the court by 9 am tomorrow.. If you don't? Kidnap the judge. - Kidnap? - Quiet. Sorry. Kidnap? Kidnap. Who will kidnap the judge? Bring the car. I'm getting late for court. Okay, sir. Who are you guys? - Who are you? - Fans! Why are you attacking me if you are my fans? Diehard fans. Only Prabhas has diehard fans. You have them too. - I have them too? - Come on, get in. Get in. Come on, get in. Why did you kidnap me? To see happiness in my brother in law's eyes. If you want to see happiness in your brother in law's eyes.. ..you should take good care of his sister. Why did you kidnap me? Who is your brother in law? What? You don't know who my brother in law is? Is your brother in law famous like Allu Aravind? Why should I know him, you idiot? Silent! Wait, I have to take this call. Giri, what happened? Successfully kidnapped him. He is a judge. Be respectful to him. Nobody can beat me in being respectful. Leave it to me. Okay. Tenali! Noise pollution. You have to listen to me. No other option. Who is he? Madam, I'm Tenali Ramakrishna, BA BL. He must've asked you if I came to meet you. Did a lawyer named Tenali Ramakrishna meet you? Tissue paper.. Huh? Hmm. Yes, ma'am. I'm that tissue paper. You don't know me.. ..but I know a lot about you. I don't have any personal grudge with him. I've a problem with the fact that they are trapping you. How are they trapping me? Didn't you tell her? - Tenali! - Wait! Tell me. You are superb. That man who's anxiously waiting to see who will win.. ..one million in the show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? That man who looks ready to beat up his wife.. ..because she didn't give him snacks with his liquor. And this man who looks like an innocent boy in white clothes. These three men are trying to frame you in a murder case. They bribed him with 70 acre mango orchard for it. Here is the proof for it. Ma'am, he's lying. Everything he said is a lie. If I'm right, he must've asked you to lose this case. He must've told you that he'll get you a bail in six months. They are framing you in this case so that.. ..Simhadri Naidu won't have any competition in Kurnool. She feeds so many people with her hands. It's okay if we don't join our hands before her.. ..but we shouldn't put hand-cuffs on her hands. It's okay if we don't help her as lawyers.. ..but we shouldn't put her in jail. I told you what I had to. Now it's up to you. Mr. Chakravarthi! Send me an NOC that you are leaving this case. Ma'am, this fellow is.. I'll see how you will win this case with Tenali's help. Really? How did he escape from that container? It seems he hid his phone in his shoe. He placed an order for 20 'Biryanis' on Swiggy. Swiggy delivery boys came and stopped our container.. ..and saved Tenali. What do we do now? Order Mutton 'Biryani' from Swiggy and stuff yourselves. Get lost! You idiot! Every kidnapper has some demands. Tell me what your demand is. My brother in law will decide that. Who is your brother in law? Your brother in law.. Okay, you can do that. I'll tell you. Yes, tell me. They gave a new date for the hearing. Leave the judge. You found the tailor? Then who did I kidnap? Okay, bye. What's wrong? I'll explain. Sir, are you not a tailor? I'm not a tailor. I'm a judge who gives verdicts. Sorry, sir. We kidnapped a judge instead of a tailor. A tailor took 700,000 rupees from us to stitch clothes.. ..for my niece's wedding and then deceived us. We kidnapped you thinking that you are him. Shoot! Our kidnapping has gone to waste. I wouldn't have been upset if you had kidnapped me.. ..thinking that I was a judge. But you guys kidnapped me thinking that I'm a tailor. That is more hurtful. We are releasing you. You may go. - Umbrella please. - Here you go. Sir! Judge, I'm sorry! Listen! Do me a favor. What's that? Don't tell anyone that you kidnapped me. I'll try. I'll manage the situation at the court. Let's go. "You sleep in my heart, my darling" "You lure me in my dreams" "You are an enchantress who is acting innocent" Tell me. Varalaxmi Devi's case has a new hearing, right? Yes. So you'll be fighting her case, right? Yes. So there are no obstacles for our wedding, right? Yes. After our wedding, I'll have all the power over you. I'm the queen. What about me? A slave. "Music" "She's like candy floss.. She's as innocent as a dove" "She created havoc in my life and made me fall in love" "You are a bandit.. Your heart is mine" "You have no other option but to give it to me" "I swear on your dazzling beauty" "I'll slave for you all my life" "Your willingness only adds fuel to my fire" "I'll use violence to make you fall in love with me" "Okay, my queen! I'll guard your beauty.." "..so that nobody steals it" "Okay.. That's why I fell for you" "Okay.. You're a lucky fellow" "Coffee from Starbucks, lunch from Subway" "And I'll bring 'Biryani' from Taj for dinner" "A kiss instead of coffee, a hug instead of lunch" "I don't want dinner if I have romance" "My queen's word is my rule" "I don't have the courage to cross her line" "My beauty is my treasure" "Plunder me and make me yours" "Okay, my queen, I'll do as you say" "Let me rule the kingdom of love" "Okay.. I'll give it to you" "Okay.. I'll make you the king" We thought you'll stand with Varalaxmi and put her in jail.. ..like Kattappa betrayed and killed Bahubali. But that Tenali came at the last minute.. ..and ruined our plan as easily as bursting a bubble. Right. You are like the mighty sea and he's like a little stream. But we shouldn't underestimate that Tenali. We should make sure our false witnesses are strong. Sure, sir. I'll bring them to your home tomorrow. Good evening, sir. Good evening. Good evening. She's my wife. - Is she the lady witness? - Yes, sir. Have a seat. Your witness at the court should be strong. You shouldn't get confused no matter how much.. ..the opposing lawyer tries to confuse you. Confidently give the same answer. Only then Varalaxmi will get punished and.. ..we all can easily get out of this mess. You know what you should say in the court, right? My husband and I will come to the court tomorrow. We'll say everything as you said. Why is she singing? She likes to talk as if she's singing. Really? The song is a problem, but the testimony is solid. Huh. The judge will believe what we say. Then he'll punish her according to the constitution. Yes. According to the law, not according to the constitution. Oh okay. Kiran! I've heard many husky voices. But I've never heard such a risky voice. Sir.. What is your name? My father and mother named me Kamala Paul. My husband lovingly calls me Bujji Paul. We use Vijaya Milk to make coffee at home. - Kiran! - Sir! - Take care. - Yes, sir. There should be no mistakes in the court tomorrow. - Yes, sir. - The judge shouldn't get confused. - Okay, sir. - Okay, sir. See you later, sir. - Bye, sir. - Kiran! Let's go. - Don't worry, sir. I'll handle it. - Okay. Let's go. Tenali! God's twists are so funny. Chakravarthi made me cry in this very court. He's not an ordinary lawyer. He's very clever. Only when we fight with a lion we come to know.. ..whether we are a lion or a lamb. I want to see my son win. Mr. Chakravarthi! Proceed. Thank you, Your Honor. Ms. Varalaxmi! Where were you on August 8th.. ..on the day of the murder? In my home. What were you doing? I was sleeping. Do you have any evidence to prove that.. ..you were sleeping in your own home that day? Objection, Your Honor. Tenali, the judge is sitting that side. Turn towards him. Sorry, Your Honor. Objection. What's your objection? Asking a woman where she slept on a particular night.. ..is like insulting her, Your Honor. Since this is a murder case.. ..men and women will be treated alike. Objection overruled. Thank you, Your Honor. So coming back to you, is there any evidence.. ..to prove that you were sleeping in your own home? There is no evidence. Point to be noted, Your Honor. Okay, Ms. Varalaxmi. People like you generally have.. ..security cameras installed in your homes. Can you present some camera footage to the court.. ..to prove that you were at home that day? Our CCTV cameras stopped working a couple of days ago. So I couldn't get any footage. Really? Point to be noted again, Your Honor. Objection again, Your Honor. What's your objection? Just because the CCTV cameras at her home.. ..are not working, it doesn't mean she killed someone. - Mr. Chakravarthi! - Your Honor. Is there an eye witness to testify that.. ..Varalaxmi committed the murder? Yes, Your Honor. Can I request Two Town CI Kiran to please come.. ..to the witness box? Okay, proceed. So, CI Kiran, what happened on the night of the murder? There was a murder. Is that a punch dialogue? No, seriously. There was a murder. Shut up and tell what really happened. I mean, please tell us what happened after that. There was a murder at 4:20 am at Kondareddy Fort. I reached the crime scene at 5:30 am. There were no eye witnesses because it happened.. ..so early in the morning. At 7:00 am, a couple called me and said they saw it. Based on the complaint they filed, I went and.. ..arrested Ms. Varalaxmi at 8:00 am. Thank you. - Sir. - That's all, Your Honor. Your Honor, I want to question the Two Town CI. Go ahead. Thank you, Your Honor. - Inspector! - Yes, sir. What happened on the night of the murder? There was a murder, sir. Okay. What happened after the murder? The constable called me and I went there. Did you go to the station or the crime scene? The crime scene. - What time did you go there? - At 7:00 am. Did the witnesses come to the station or call you? No, they called me. The murder happened at 4:20 am. Why did they call you at 7:00 am? Maybe the witnesses were scared, sir. So they weren't scared after two and a half hours? Maybe they thought about it. Okay. The witnesses called you. But how did they get your number? I.. Actually.. Please note this point, Your Honor. You can leave, sir. You can leave. Your Honor, please allow me to cross-examine.. ..the witnesses presented by the public prosecutor. Okay, proceed. Hello, sir. Hello. Mr. Ananth! Did you see Ms. Varalaxmi commit the murder? We saw it with our four eyes at 4:20 in the morning. What were you doing there at that hour? That day we were travelling to Vijayawada.. ..from Kurnool via Srisailam Ghat Road. You are here to testify, why are you singing songs? My wife says everything in the form of a song, sir. Okay, carry on. We stayed in Swarna Palace Hotel in Vijayawada. We visited Goddess Kanaka Durga Temple in the morning. Good. The priest there rotated the holy fire before us. After that we both ate God's offerings. We did circumambulations in the temple. Darn! Because of you I lost interest in giving a verdict. It would've been bearable if you had a good voice. It sounds like someone put stones in a can and is shaking it. Just ignore his words, dear. Go ahead. That's how we visited the temple. We booked return tickets to Kurnool. We reached Kurnool through Guntur, via Srisailam. Yes, you came and you saw. I'm a short tempered man. Don't test my patience. I'll tell you. Please don't get angry. Calm down and listen to me. Very good. Sing. And when we started walking towards Kondareddy Fort.. ..it started raining heavily with lightning and thunder. Then Varalaxmi came there. She slit a man's throat right in front of our eyes. That poor man died on the spot. We were quivering in fear when we saw it. Stop it. You are destroying people's lives. One of our lawyers puked his guts out and.. ..passed motion at the same time. Take him to the hospital. I'm letting this slide because according to.. ..Indian Constitution, we all have freedom of speech. Otherwise I would've filed a case against you. Go ahead. You stop talking. You are an eye witness too, right? You are her husband, right? You were there at the crime scene, right? You tell me. After that we left from there, went home, took bath.. ..and had breakfast. Then we felt sad that.. ..the man who was murdered was a reporter. So, we called the CI. Okay, everything is alright. But how did you know that he was a reporter? We guessed it, sir. Please note this point, Your Honor. They guessed it. Sorry, sir. I just said it in my anxiety. We didn't know that he was a reporter. Please note this point as well, Your Honor. He said it because of anxiety. - I mean.. - Forget that. What time did you reach Kurnool? We reached at 4:00 am. What time did you see the murder? We both saw it at 4:20 am with our eyes. You saw it at 4:20, right? Sir, they are lying. You didn't witness any murder. The bus from Vijayawada to Kurnool AP20 5362.. ..reached Kurnool at 4:45 am. If you travelled in a bus that reached Kurnool at 4:45 am.. ..how did you see a murder that happened at 4:20 am? Kurnool RTC Bus Depot reports, Your Honor. I object, Your Honor. He is misleading my witnesses.. ..to help Varalaxmi get away with the murder. If you give me 1,000 rupees.. ..I can create a 100 bills and reports like this one. You can create them, sir. But you can't create CCTV camera footage.. ..recorded at the RTC Bus Depot. Darn! The evidence, Your Honor. They didn't go to Vijayawada that day. The proof is their apartment's CCTV camera footage. According to Section 192, it is a crime to create false proofs. I request you to strictly punish the CI who created.. ..these false evidences. My client Ms. Varalaxmi is a person filled with humanity. I request you to pronounce her innocent and release her. After hearing both sides, the court orders an investigation.. ..on CI Kiran Kumar who has created false evidences.. ..and the couple who came in as false witnesses. The court suspends criminal lawyer Chakravarthi from.. ..bar counsel for misleading the court with false evidence.. ..and annuls all the cases on Ms. Varalaxmi.. ..who helps everyone in the community. The court pronounces her innocent and releases her. Darn! Finally your son defeated Chakravarthi. Right. Don't underestimate Durga Rao's son. A broker's son will become a broker. Yes! - Thanks, Tenali. - Thank you, madam. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Thank you. - Congrats. - Well done. Tenali! Congratulations! Hey! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Oh my God! Put pressure on it. Bhavani! Madam! Yes, madam! Are you okay? I'm okay. Who is he? Find out if I've harmed him in anyway knowingly or unknowingly. Tenali went after him. He won't let him get away. Hey! Do you want to die? Stupid people. I'm a young guy and even I'm panting for breath. Do you need murder attempts and chases at this age? It is a crime to kill a person. It is a great sin to kill a good person. Who said she's a good lady? Who said that? Everyone thinks she's a fish in the water. But actually she's a crocodile disguised as a fish. That's why she killed my son. Varalaxmi madam didn't kill journalist Bhupal. I just proved it in the court and won the case. If you don't believe me, at least believe the court. You want me to believe the court? The evidence that the court needs are not facts. There is a fact that you and they don't know. She's the murderess. She's the murderess. Very bad. You tricked me. Don't you have any humanity in you? You joined as my employee, ate my food, drank my water.. ..and gathered proofs about my third party properties.. ..black money, illegal businesses and hidden gold.. ..to pass it to the media and upload it on social media. - Bhupal! - Yes, madam? Give me your phone. - Bhupal! - Oh God! He's getting away! Rascal! Do you think I'm yesteryear actress Savitri to shoot a film about me? You are like a pest that ruins the crop. You are deceiving poor ones in the name of helping them. You promised to build houses for the poor people.. ..took millions of rupees from the banks as loans and.. ..kept that money for yourself. You destroyed many villages in the name of a solar plant. You stole billions and billions of government money.. ..in the name of contracts. Mines, sand, real estate, you ate up everything except air. And you did all this with fake owned businesses. The innocent public doesn't know all this. They put you on a pedestal and worship you. It's useless to read Gita to a person who's in coma. I should've known that it is useless to talk to you. It is a big mistake to kill me. Your political career will end today. She killed him. Nobody will understand the pain of losing my young son in death. You won't get it. Nobody will. Nobody will. Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! Let him go! Madam! Madam! Please let him go! Please let him go! Madam! Please madam! No, madam! Please madam! The Sumati Satakam says that a mighty serpent.. ..dies at the hands of tiny ants. But I'm not a serpent to die in the hands of ants like you. I'm a lioness. You and your son are like a strand of hair. And you tried to kill me with a tiny knife? You think only you have tiny knives? I don't have them? No! No! Hey! Quiet! I'm not good, Mr. Lawyer. I'm very bad. Hey! I love money and power, Mr. Lawyer. And if anybody stands in my way... I kill them. I'll spare your life hoping that you won't stand in my way. Got it? - Listen! - Yes? It is raining. Make some chili fritters for me. Okay. It will be awesome to enjoy a drink with the chili fritters. Nothing doing. Tenali is back. Why did you sit there? What happened to him? Tenali, what's wrong? What happened? - Tenali. - Son! - Why are you sitting here? - Tell us. Why are you sitting in the rain? Let's go inside. Let's go, son. What's the matter? She killed him, Mom. She killed him before my eyes. Who are you talking about? Varalaxmi Devi is not a good woman. I defended a murderer who should be in prison. I didn't know that she is the murderer. She killed a man cruelly in front of my eyes. If I hadn't taken up her case, that man would've been alive. You brought her out thinking that she's a good woman. That's not your fault. You believed a lie and helped Varalaxmi to win. It won't be difficult for you to prove the truth. She's not invincible. I'm sure she made a mistake while committing murders. If you can find it, you can put her behind the barts. If you can find one evidence.. ..you can reopen the case in High Court. Give me a cup of tea. Thanks. What's your name, kid? Ramu. - Do you come here every day? - Yes. What time? I come here at 4:00 every morning. Ramu, someone was killed her on August 8th. Were you here that day as well? It was raining that day. So I didn't come. But even if there is rain or hailstorm.. ..even if the Kurnool town is flooded.. ..there's a family that walks around the fort.. ..at 4:00 every morning. Do you know their names? His name is Kovelakuntla Kishore. - Excuse me. - Yes? Do you know where Kovelakuntla Kishore lives? Kovelakuntla Kishore? That's the house. Why are you pacing like that? I'm scared, Grandma. Every time I open my eyes or close my eyes.. ..I remember Varalaxmi Devi killing that man. Why did you give birth to this idiot? If anybody sees us, they will think we killed that man. Idiot! - You know him. - Here, eat this carrot. Will this reduce my anxiety? No, it won't. Hello, Grandma! I think he's Varalaxmi's man. Shut up! Are you a Gram Volunteer? Did you bring all the goods? No, I'm not a Gram Volunteer. Are you a papery boy? Grandma! I'm Tenali Ramakrishna, BA BL. I'm a lawyer. I told you. Lawyer means police. Police means lawyer. Shut up. - What do we have to do with lawyers? - What do we have to do with them? - We don't have any cases on us. - We don't. Oh no, there is no case on you. But you are in a case. - Case? - Case? What is he saying? Why will we be in a case? Mind your tongue. Sir, please hear me out. Does your whole family go for a walk.. ..at 4:00 am every morning at Kondareddy Fort? Yes, we go as a family. For brisk walking. Did you go for walking on 8th August.. ..even though it was raining heavily? Yes, we did. So what? Did you witness a murder there? Why would we witness a murder? You witnessed it. Did you see us seeing it? - No. - So we didn't see it. You are telling a lie with so much courage. Why are you afraid to tell the truth? No way. We are not afraid of anything. I think you came to the wrong address. I came to the right address. You know that too. Grandma, the man who died is your grandson's age. Would you do the same thing if this happened to your grandson? That young man died for a truth. If you can come and testify in the court.. ..at least his death will have a meaning. Our lives are more important than lies and truths, son. You are right. Why should we bother about law and justice? Our lives are important to us. There are human beings in this house, but no humanity. Wait a minute. We'll testify. Wait, Grandma. We've no idea about humans or humanity. But I feel there's sincerity in your fight. We are ready to support you. We'll testify. Thank you, brother. Thank you. Tenali Ramakrishna has reopened the case in High Court. You are the only one who can stop her. I can stop Polavaram Project but not her. Ma'am, please calm down. Do you think what I did is wrong? Is it wrong? It's not wrong. It's better to sit here quietly. You think it is right to murder someone? Is it right? It's wrong. Correct. Murdering someone is wrong. But is it wrong for me to do it? Mom! How much wealth do we have? Around 50 billion, baby. I own 50 billion, is it wrong for me to kill one person? It's not as simple as painting with colors, madam. You killed a man and painted with his blood. Sorry, madam. One murder. Only one murder. So many people died in the tsunami. Hundreds of people died in the Titli storm. Did they file a case on them? This crazy lady doesn't know the difference between.. ..natural disasters and people committing murders. Why do you worry so much? Just kill that Tenali too. He's not sleeping so that you can kill him easily. He's alert. Kill him it seems.. Either Tenali should be afraid of us or those witnesses.. ..only then we can win. Get it done. Leave that to us, ma'am. We will find a way to scare them. Come here. Is there nobody at home? They vacated the house, sir. - Don't you know where they went? - No, sir. They were here a few days ago. I think he has moved the witnesses to a safer place. - You think so? - Yes. Okay, let's go. Run! Faster! Oh God! Stop! I said stop! As if we'll stop. How dare you file a case on our madam? Run! - Run! Hurry up! - Dad, come here. - Come here. - What took you so long? What's in the bag? Did you bring bombs? No bombs. Then? - Burqas. - Burqas? - Okay, everyone put them on. - Give me one. This is a brilliant idea. Hurry up! Madam! Madam! Five people came running this way. Did you see them? Our five people and your five people are different. (Hindu Devotional Song) Madam! Just a minute. (Hindu Devotional Song) We six Muslim woman are walking on the road. I'll talk to you later. - Are you a Muslim? - Yeah. Why do you have a Lord Venkatesha's song as your phone ringtone? - She will explain. - What kind of question is that? Our Bibi Nancharamma got married to.. ..your Lord Venkatesha. So we all are united. That's right. We are getting late to go to the mosque. Let's go. Okay, go. Hey, wait a minute. Ladies don't go to the mosque. If we can't go to the mosque, we'll go to the temple. Why do you think so much, cute boy? Let's go. Allah will grant your wishes. Okay, please go. What happened? Did you catch them? No, they got away. What do we do now? I've another plan. I'm already frustrated that I have no cases on hand. Don't disturb me. Listen to me. I've no cases on hand. So, don't irritate me. (Old Movie Song) (Old Movie Song) (Old Movie Song) (Old Movie Song) Hey.. I'm sorry. I bumped into you on purpose. Did I cause you any pain? It's a bit painful, but it's a sweet pain. Oh. So, why did you bump into me? When I'm sad, I bump into a man's body.. ..then my whole body relaxes. Very nice habit. What's your name? Chammak Chandrika. - Nice name. - Thank you. A woman like you should be in a temple, not at the court. Since I'm spending my time at the temple.. ..my husband is spending his time with the neighbor. That's why I had to come to the court. So, you are married? A betel leaf has to turn into a 'Paan' at some point.. ..and a girl has to get married one day. - Lust. - What? I mean yes. I want to hug you and cry. May I? This is the court. But you need comfort, right? Come here. I'm sorry. I know why your husband is going after other woman. My husband and I are living together.. ..but we are not happy in our marriage. Why? Please come to my house and change my husband. Please save my marriage. Let's go to your house. Please come. This is my home. Call your husband. Hubby! - Hello! - Hello! Hello.. Who are these guys? That one is my first husband and this one is my last. What about the guys in the middle? All these are.. I feel shy to say it. Shut up! Don't kill me with your coyness. Who are all the guys in the middle? - They all.. In between.. In between.. - Shut up! They all are my in between husbands. So many? I have a big.. - What? - Heart. That's why I gave my heart to all of them. Your heart is not a bank loan to give it to everyone. Did you see how many are there? They can make an IPL m. They just need a coach. Why can't you be the coach? Shut up! It's not wrong for you to live with so many men.. ..but your husband can't be with another woman? And you want me to defend your case? I won't. You rascal! Rascal? How dare you! Have you gone mad because of so many husbands? Why did you hit me? Why did you hit me? Where did you hide the witnesses? In my shoes. Is that a joke? Oh no...! Oh God! Oh no! Tell me! Where did you hide the witnesses? I don't know what you are talking about. Let me go! Where are the witnesses? Tell me or you'll die! I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I've a friend named Giri. I sent them to his house. Who are you? Why are you so ugly? My name is Chammak Chandrika. Chammak? Chandrika. I see. - I freshly moved into the next house. - Freshly? Can I come into your house? Put your left leg first and step inside. Tell me, Chammak. What can I do for you? Why is she crying? I want marriage. - Marriage? - I want marriage. Usually people ask the neighbors for milk or yogurt. What do you mean you want marriage? - I want marriage. - Marriage? I want someone to put off the fire in me. Put off the fire? Do you want me to do that? You can't put off the fire in me. You want all the Avengers to come and help you out? No need. I just want Kishore who is hiding in your house. Kishore? Kishore? Yes, he fell in love with me. He said he'll marry me. Then he deceived me. I deceived her? Did he make you pregnant? I can't become pregnant. Why not? Oh that, okay. Bro, your friend is here. Who are you? Kishore! - Kishore! - What a loving couple! I'm okay.. You are uglier than the ugly faces that.. ..Google shows up when you type ugly face. Who are you? Wait a minute. Turn that side. Turn this side. Should I turn back as well? - No, I'm already feeling giddy. - Oh no! Don't touch me. You don't have any beauty. You don't even look like a woman. How can I deceive you? Your whole family deceived me. Your mother, your father, your grandmother.. ..promised me that they will get me married to you.. ..but they deceived me. - Come on, let's go down. - Wait there. Come here. Did you promise her that.. ..you'll get me married to her? You didn't find anyone else? When did we say we'll get you married to him? You don't know me. Don't mess with me. Show me your face. Turn around. I had the same reaction. Wretched woman! When did I promise you that.. ..I'll get you married to my grandson? He's a good boy. Do you have any other family members? Shut up! This is our family. A small family is a happy family. What a stupid family! How did you change your voice? Oh God! The bad guys! Don't worry, I have a plan. Complan? No, Boost. We'll use it there. Let's go. I thought we were running away. Why did you bring us all to Varalaxmi's house? This is your lawyer Tenali Ramakrishna's style. We shouldn't run away, we'll come to a compromise. Maybe Tenali forgot about it. I'll go and convince Varalaxmi for a compromise. Wait here. "A beautiful white sari" "Your hair adorned with jasmines" Hi, auntie! I came here to make a deal with you, auntie. Should I explain it, auntie? Why are you looking at me like that, auntie? Why are they hitting me while I'm talking to you, auntie? Why are these crazy guys hitting me, auntie? Stop it! Stop it! Ask them to stop, auntie. Did I say something wrong, auntie? Compromise is taking too much time, Dad. Too much time. At least you stop them, big auntie. How dare you call me big auntie? Stop it. Do you think my head is a coconut? What if it breaks? You look like a street vendor that sells sweets. How dare you call my daughter auntie? Oh. Are you hitting me for calling her auntie? Should I call her big sister? Should I call her baby? What should I call her then? Madam, please say something. That's right. Call her madam. Auntie! Oh God! Not again! What's the matter? Okay, I'll tell you. Did you kill Bhupal.. ..the journalist who works for the magazine The Truth? Is it true or not? I killed him. So what? Since you killed him, confess it in the court tomorrow. You'll be punished for it and.. ..Mr. Raghuram's soul will rest in peace. If you come to a compromise, the case will be closed. No, you will be closed. Journalist Bhupal created a report about.. ..my fake owned businesses and my criminal records. That's why I killed him. I killed his father too. I'll crush everyone that comes in the way of my political career. Okay. I'll tell you who should come to a compromise. Send those witnesses to me. Yes, I'm fine. Hey.. What happened, bro? Nothing. We've reached a compromise. All okay. Superb, bro. So, she agreed to go to prison? Yes. But she wants to talk to you before she goes to jail. - Go upstairs. - Okay, makes sense. Come. Wait, bro. She likes being called auntie. She loves it. - Yes. - That info is enough for me. I'll call her auntie so many times that she'll be floored. Yes, go ahead. Call her auntie. Say hello to big auntie too. Thank you. - Come on. - Here we are. The house is very cool like cooling glasses. How many people did you kill to build such a big house? She means that you must've worked so hard to build it. - Hello, auntie. - Hello, auntie. Stop it! We've already come to a compromise. Silly men. So, I heard you confessed about.. ..killing the journalist Bhupal, auntie. We are very happy, auntie. Hey, stop it! Stop it! Ask them to stop it, auntie! Have you both gone blind? He's my father. Don't hit him like that. Stop them, auntie! You look like the overseer of Uncle's Association. How dare you call our ma'am auntie? Oh, I got it. Sorry, madam. A stupid man gave me wrong information. I shouldn't call you auntie. I know that now. I should call you madam. Is that right, madam? Sorry, madam. Did you see my daughter murdering that man? Yes, we did. Don't hit us. Will you testify in the court? Yes, we will. We'll say whatever you want us to say. Now you are on the right track. Very good. What is so amusing in this situation? I thought they won't hit ladies. But your mother is getting hit too. Your mother got hit too. Shut up. The circumstances are not favorable to us. What should we do when the circumstances are not favorable? We shouldn't go to catch fish in the sea. Why did I give birth to such a stupid man? How dare you slap your own father? You'll die if they beat you up. I understood everything. You didn't murder anyone. Tenali Ramakrishna beat us up and.. ..forced us to testify against you. If you say that, you'll live. If you say the truth, you'll die. Okay. Be ready to come to the court tomorrow morning. Okay. Rukmini, shall we have breakfast? Rukmini! You've been avoiding me for a month now. This is unacceptable. It's not fair at all. I'm really surprised that you are talking about being fair. Shut up, Rukmini, will you? Are you so blinded by that Tenali's charm that.. ..you are insulting the father who taught you to speak? Within a few days, mark my words.. ..Tenali will sell his black coat and open a roadside tea stall. Then you'll realize my value. Value is not about money or mango orchards, Dad. Value is about honesty and goodness. Rukmini, your father may be a bad man for outsiders.. ..but he's been a good father to you. How can we send you as a daughter in law.. ..into a family that gives false testimonies in the court? How can we get you married to that incapable lawyer? Who is an incapable lawyer? Tenali is smarter than Dad. I know how intelligent he is. There are no eye witnesses to Varalaxmi's crime. Kishore was Bhupal's best friend. So, when Tenali found out about it, he met Kishore. He asked his help to make Varalaxmi pay for her crime. He tricked Varalaxmi's men into believing that.. ..there are eye witnesses to her crime. He made her find them and take them home. And they went there with spy cameras. Did you kill him or not? Is it true or not? This house is very cool. They recorded Varalaxmi's confession. I killed him. So what? Now that video footage.. ..will be presented as evidence in the High Court. When an intelligent man goes rogue, he becomes like Dad. But when a good man puts his intelligence to good use.. ..he becomes like Tenali. Hello! Ma'am, I'm Chakravarthi here. What is it? I did a mistake. I'm sorry for that. I'll tell you a secret. You'll be in trouble if you don't believe it. The people with you are not eye witnesses. If the judge sees the footage that they have.. ..you might be arrested in the court itself. Those people shouldn't reach the court at any cost. Okay. Why did you stop here, madam? - Let's have some tea. - Okay. - I want green tea. - I'll have lemon tea. I want black tea. They don't have so many varieties here. They have normal tea. Go and sit down. Then why did we stop here? This whole place should be in our control for two hours. Send everybody away. Hey, get up! Come on, go out! What's wrong, dear? Why do you look so worried? They are not eye witnesses. They recorded everything we said with secret cameras. She made everyone leave just because she wanted to have tea? Money can buy you anything you want. That's right. What do we do now? It's not wrong to take the donkey's help in our time of need. Who is that donkey? Tell me, Varalaxmi. Two cats were fighting for one piece of break. But a monkey came in and ate the whole piece. Similarly, you and I are busy fighting.. ..and Tenali is using it to his advantage. What do we do now? Let's kill everyone. They are working so hard, what are they doing? They are making electricity. That's not a dish that you can make in your kitchen. Did you ever get an electric shock? I get a shock when I pay the bill every time. Oh God, it's a painful feeling, madam. Now you can taste it. It's very tasty. What is this? Why are you tying us up? We won't run away. We are on your side. Switch it on. What is this? Free electricity. Farmers need free electricity, not us, you stupid man. Do we look like farmers to you, you idiot? How dare you abuse me? Stop it, madam. Please stop it. They all have hair. Smoke is coming out of my head. Please stop it. We are on your side. Why are you torturing us? Bravo! Brilliant actors! You didn't see me killing the man but you said you saw it. You came to my house and made me confess.. ..to the murder and recorded it with secret cameras. Don't underestimate us. We have Tenali's backing. Yeah. He's on the way. Get him! "Ramakrishna Tenali.." "Just do as I say" "Ramakrishna Tenali.." "Just do as I say" "Ramakrishna Tenali.." - What's that? - Petrol. For what? I think to burn us. - Don't give them any ideas. - What is this? Even God of Death doesn't torture people so much in hell. There's a limit. I'm not as good as God of Death. Will you respectfully give me the cameras or die? We'll give you respect if you want, but not the cameras. I know you've no hair, don't you have brains too? How dare you hit your father a second time? She's going to kill us. Which one is better? This is better. Then it's better to give her the cameras. - Take it. - Put it in this. Take this bag as well. Put it inside. You too. Yes. If you let us go, we'll book an Ola Cab to go home. Who is letting you go? Tenali Ramakrishna! Where are you? Oh no! He took the evidence bag! The evidence is gone! "Ramakrishna Tenali" Ram into him, madam! Hit him! Do it! "Just do as I say" Ram into him! Come on! "Ramakrishna Tenali" "Just do as I say" Madam! Stop! Stop! Stop! Just do as I say" Why are they dressed as Bahubali's soldiers.. ..in similar helmets, clothes and on similar scooters? (Shlokas) (Shlokas) This rascal is trying to trick us. No matter how many tricks he plays.. ..finally he has to come to the court. I'll finish him there. Madam, did we come to the High Court or to the Ayyappa Hill? Everyone is in black gowns and black helmets. I think this is Tenali's plan. Tenali Ramakrishna! Remove your helmet! I'm not Ramakrishna. I'm Balakrishna. Balakrishna? Okay, go. - Ramakrishna! - Mohankrishna! Harikrishna. Jaikrishna. My name is Saikrishna. All Krishnas are here except for Superstar Krishna. Tenali Ramakrishna! Where are you? "Ramakrishna Tenali.." "Just do as I say" "Ramakrishna Tenali.." Thank you, boss. Tenali, you rascal! Where is our evidence bag? Oh no! I thought I'll lose it if I have it with me.. ..so I gave it to the judge, auntie. I killed him. So what? I killed his father too. After examining the evidence that was submitted.. ..Varalaxmi is considered a criminal by the court. The court orders the ED to seize her fake owned.. ..properties and investigate her assets. The court orders the police department to take.. ..Varalaxmi into custody right away. You! You killed a man before my eyes. No! How did you think that I'll let you get away with it? - Madam, take her away. - Come on! Varalaxmi, Ashtalaxmi, Dhanalaxmi, Dhanyalaxmi.. ..Santanalaxmi and even Bhagyalaxmi.. If you are good to people, they will worship you. But if you do scams, conspiracies and murders.. ..they will pull you down and put you behind bars. You managed to hoard 50 billion rupees. How did you forget this tiny logic? Madam, what is this? Don't think this is over. I'll kill you even if I'm in prison. Wow. All the best. Yes! "Ramakrishna Tenali.." "Just do as I say" "Then your life will be a cozy vacation in Kulu Manali" How dare you! - Rascal? How dare you! - I got it. How.. We are Rajyalaxmi's men. I'm Nageshwar Rao's man. We booked return tickets for Kurnool. You are killing us with your songs. - One more. I have one last line. - Another line? I'm so sorry. If I start arguing.. My argument.. She's criminal lawyer.. One more. I thought so. Got it. Okay. I'll kill you. (Shlokas) Sir, she's laughing. (Shlokas) (Shlokas)
