[instrumental music] [instrumental music] RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM [music continues] [giggling] Look at this. Look at this. Hi. I thought this might get your attention. [chuckles] Sorry about the staring. I think she's a little star struck. We saw you at the Christmas show last year. - You sang O Holy Night. - Oh. - And it's her favorite. - Oh, it's my favorite, too. - This is Hannah. - Hi, Hannah. I'm Clio. - Yes. - Can I give her a hug? Oh, she was wondering if she can give you a hug. Of course. Aw... So what are you gonna be singing this year? Oh, I'm not... uh, sure yet. Well, whatever it is, you have a fan for life. Oh, thank you. Can you say thank you to Ms. Clio for the candy cane? - Thank you, Ms. Clio. - You're welcome. Thanks, Clio. Appreciate it. All right, let's go. - Bye, guys. - Oh. [instrumental music] [birds chirping] [instrumental music] What the... My locket. It's gone. It's gotta be around here somewhere. We'll find it. [scoffs] Jack! Get up! I need to check your side. What time is it? It's time to get your butt out the bed. Whoa. I don't think we have enough pillows. [scoffs] I could do without the sarcasm. - I thought you were looking. - I am looking. - What's this here? - You found it? Ah, I thought the washing machine ate it. You know how much that locket means to me. Come on, Clio, I was just kidding. You know I get punchy when I'm tired. I'm sorry! [instrumental music] - [sighs] - Coffee? Yes, please. [coffee sloshing] [sighs] Sorry for waking you up so early. Well, you're my favorite alarm clock. My dad gave me that locket. I know, babe. I'm sorry. Maybe it's at the shop. No, I swear I had it on before bed last night. [timer beeping] Maybe it's a sign that it's time to finally start talking about it. Mm? Clio, it's been almost a year since he passed. You haven't said a word about it. Do you know that I had to lie to an adorable little girl last night just so I didn't have to explain why I'm not doing the show? So? You haven't been yourself lately, Clio. That's okay. It's your first Christmas without your dad. I'm worried about you. I think it would help you to be around people who love you, Clio. So dropping out of the Christmas show just doesn't seem like a good idea. [exhales] My dad and I have done that show every Christmas Eve for 20 years. I can't do it without him. I get it. I'm sorry. I don't wanna push you. I know you get enough of that from your mom. Oh, now you wanna talk about my mom? [sighs] Your mom wants to make us dinner tonight, so I might have invited her over. Ah... You might have, Jack? I'm not ready to face her. I agree she could have handled things better. You know, maybe she didn't tell you about your dad's cancer because... it's what he wanted. Clio, your mom lost him, too. And it's the holidays. Right. And there you are. - [cell phone chimes] - Merry Christmas. I'm serious. Gayle is totally cyber stalking our Insta page. [sighs] She likes every single thing I post, she even commented on my bagel this morning. You posted your bagel on our Instagram page? I don't think it's used for that. Gayle liked it. Hash-tag delish. Hash-tag wish I had a bagel right about now. Direct quote. - [chuckles] Now I'm hungry. - Right? She probably just wants to butter me up because she knows I'm the only one who can make you do the Christmas show. What is it with everyone and this Christmas show today? We will break you. - [sighs] - Oh. We have to post that. [camera clicking] [instrumental music] Oh, looks like someone could use a hot cup of coffee. [door unlocks] [bells jingling] Ooh. Hey there. Any interest in a pick-me-up? Oh. Thank you. I appreciate it. [sighs] It's freezing out here. Ooh. Sorry it's not a bagel or something. Are you kiddin' me, you think I'd choose a bagel over a freshly-baked cookie? My thoughts exactly. I'm Clio. Kind Clio. Fred Myers, ma'am. Fred, you must be freezing out here. Well, this warm coffee will heat me right up, ma'am. Hit the spot. So, um, the thing is, Fred, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but... Oh, I get it. You don't want some tired old man standing out in front of your store messin' up your business. Oh, I wasn't gonna say tired. Yeah, but you was gonna say old, huh? No, I swear, I wasn't gonna say that. Well, you don't need to say it. These grays speak for theyselves, don't they? Well, I'm sure you earned each and every one of 'em. Yeah, indeed I did. Well, do you need a place to stay, Mr. Myers? Because there's a shelter over on Fig, and they serve a hot breakfast every morning. Oh, Lord. I believe I made the world's worst first impression. I'm in need of no accommodations and nor any food. I put up some lights on some shops over on Bridge Street, and I noticed that you didn't have any up yet. Oh, my gosh, I'm so embarrassed. I really didn't mean anything by it. No apologies necessary, Clio. I'm a stranger in town. Sometimes that need questions. I would've done the same thing. That's very nice of you to say, but I just feel so bad. I'm really sorry. Not another word, kind Clio. You go on about your day without another worry. I'mma be on my way. Thank you. Wait, do you have a business card or somethin' so I can get in contact with you about the lights? I'll be around. [instrumental music] Are you sure we can't help you with anything, Eileen? No, no, no. You sit and relax. [timer beeps] [oven door opens] Lasagna, mom? I thought you weren't eating dairy. It's vegan. Sounds great. I've been trying to learn more vegan recipes. [Eileen] It's been really good to have something to focus on instead of just missing Robert. Cooking's been good. Well, I can't wait to try it. [Eileen] Oh, shoot! What happened? I forgot the nutritional yeast. Now, that's what makes the dish. [sighs] It tastes exactly like Parmesan cheese. Um, sure. - I can run to the store. - Would you? It doesn't taste the same without it. - Uh-uh. You stay. I'll go. - Clee... I got a few things to get anyway. ♪ Fall ♪ ♪ On your kne-e-es ♪ ♪ Oh he-e-ear ♪ ♪ The angel's voices ♪ ♪ Oh night ♪ ♪ Divi-i-ine ♪ ♪ Oh night ♪ ♪ When Christ was born ♪ ♪ Oh night ♪ ♪ Oh holy ni-i-ight ♪ ♪ Oh ni-i-ight ♪ ♪ Divine ♪ [applauding] Thank you. Kind Clio! How lucky am I to see you twice in one day? My dad and I used to sing that song together every Christmas. It was our favorite song. Well, is my favorite song. Well, that gives us something in common, doesn't it? I knew I liked you. See you around, Mr. Myers. Wait, how would you like to work in my store with me? You could sing for the customers while they shop and put us all in a Christmas spirit. I-I don't know about that. Well, it beats singing out here in the cold for tips. Or hanging lights, for that matter. I can't argue with that. Meet me tomorrow at 9:00? Okay. Do you have a Santa Claus suit? Do I look like I have a Santa suit to you? Well, I don't wanna assume because that didn't work out well for me earlier. Don't worry about it, I'll figure it out. Promise me you'll show up? I promise. Okay. [door opens] Oh, good! You brought it! Please tell me I'm not gonna be wearing that thing. Only on Fridays. Well, I guess it'll be an excuse to eat more Christmas cookies. It's not for you. It's for Mr. Myers. Wait, what am I missing? Who's that? He's a singer. He's gonna sing for the customers. This is going to be perfect! Wow. Is that a smile I see? Just a little one. Do tell what brings this on. - Good morning. - Mr. Myers! By someone, you meant the man you thought was homeless from yesterday? Come on in. Would you like some coffee? Oh. No, thank you. I just came from an early job. I haven't even had a chance to freshen up. Mr. Myers, Candice. Candice, Mr. Myers. [clears throat] Just call me Fred. How do you do? Much better now that I know you're the one wearing the Santa suit. - You found one. - Yeah. I hope it's okay. I mean, I hope you don't mind wearing it. Sweetheart, this is my only option. So let's go with the suit. - You have a rest room I can use? - Yes. Right over this way. - Thank you. Excuse me. - Here. Right here. - Huh? - Mm-hmm. - What's his angle? - What do you mean? Well, he's a musician, right? And he just swoops into town and lands on the doorstep of the one person who just lost her musician father? Seems like a pretty big coincidence. Think about it. There are a lot of conmen out there. Did you even check his references? You watch way too much Dateline.

You were in your element. - Thanks to you. - Hey, you know what? Can you guys both keep a look out for my gold heart locket? - Oh, no. You lost your locket? - [scoffs] I've looked everywhere. I'll keep my eyes open for it. [cell phone ringing] Oh, shoot. It's Gayle. Well, hurry up before it goes to voice mail. That's the point. Hello? Clio's phone. Oh, hi. I wasn't expecting anybody to pick up. This wouldn't be Clio, would it? Hm? Hello? Hello? Hello. Hi, Gayle. Oh. I was starting to get worried about you. What can I do for you, Gayle? Well, you haven't been picking up your phone 'cause you know exactly why I'm calling. Am I right or am I right? I'm right. Well, we had our first rehearsal tonight and everybody misses you. Uh, the show won't be the same without you. I'm sorry, Gayle, but I have a lot going on right now. Oh, sweetheart, I know it's been a tough year. We all miss your dad, too. Thank you, so you understand that I can't do the show without him. But don't you think he'd want you to do it, Clio? I mean, he's the one who started the children's charity. Look, we depend on ticket sales to keep this thing going. And you sell the most tickets because, well, people just can't wait to see you perform. You don't wanna disappoint the children, do you? I can't this year. I'm sorry, Gayle. So you do want to disappoint the children. Goodbye, Gayle. Now, look, practically, the whole town is in the show. I don't want you to have a bad case of the FOMO. It's still a no. Goodbye. Wait. But, wait a minute! Oh. Why do I try so hard? I'm such a good person. Um, I don't know what that phone call was about, but don't let it get to you. Every year she sings at the Christmas show. But she's been down since her dad died. So she's been putting off everything important in her life to avoid having any feelings about it. You know I'm right. I didn't know you were a singer. You should hear her. Fred, you should do the show. Well, I don't think it's for me. But thank you. And I wanna thank you for today. You've taken an old man out of his rut. Oh, wait. Your pay. No, no. No, no, no, no. - That's too much. - Whoa. I should've taken singing lessons. No, you've earned it. [sighs] Thank you. [bells jingling] [Dr. Brown] How are you feeling today, Fred? Well, I've been able to sit up. Keep food down. Have you been getting any sleep at all? I know that the shelter can be a little noisy. Oh, uh, I'm not at the shelter anymore. - Got a little crowded. - [Dr. Brown] Mm. So, um, I moved out, but I got a place. Did you move in with your daughter? I'm close by. I get to see my granddaughters every day. They're getting big. Growing like weeds. And my daughter Mia? You should see how she is with them. She's like a, a super mom. And she's smart. Oh, she's so smart. She's a lawyer, you know? I ever tell you that? Yeah, I think you mentioned it. So it looks like you're out of your pain meds. Yeah, well, I hate those things. But I did have them all. A couple of tough nights. Hm. I really wish you'd change your mind about the surgery. [sighs] I'm tired, doc. Well, you're gonna be a lot more tired from this point on. Why wouldn't you wanna try something that could help? I've done everything I was supposed to do. Taken chemo, done the radiation. Every time I do those things, it makes me sick as a dog. And it keeps coming back. So what's the use? I know you're worried about your voice, but this will just give you more time. Yeah. Time. I've been around the sun more times than I can count. I've done my time. I just want peace. All right, well, these pain meds will at least help give you some of that comfort, okay? But if you ever change your mind about the surgery, I want you to know that you'll always have a spot here. Okay? VA patients get first priority. I think you should save that first priority to somebody who is... [sighs] more deserving. I can't think of anyone more deserving than you, Fred. Here you go. Thank you. I'll see you soon. [door opens] [door shuts] [sighs] With veggies. [indistinct chatter] Uh... [instrumental music] [groans] [exhales] Okay, so this one was made in 1892. - And it still has all its... - Clio! ...pieces. And it's kinda cool. - It has a nice little fancy... - [Candice] Clio! Um, if you'd like to look around, we have more of a selection that way. Thanks. What's wrong? I was running a little late, so I decided to take a shortcut through the alley behind Murphy's. - Clio, Fred was there. - Okay, is he on his way? No. He was sleeping there in his truck. He told me he had a place to stay. Yeah, that place is his truck. Ah... You said behind Murphy's, right? Can you help her with the music boxes? I'll be right back. Hi. Can I help you?

Uh, I just put those there. I appreciate it, but we need to take these to the floor. But we can barely move around on there as it is. It'll be cozy. I'm so glad you decided not to hire that adorable, muscular stock boy. I obviously didn't need him. Look at you go. [giggles] ♪♪ I don't understand. [chuckles] Am I missing something? Remember the first time we met you told me you had a place to stay? Yeah. You didn't tell me that place was your truck. Oh, well, I didn't think it would matter to you. It matters very much to me. It's too cold out there, Fred. There's no reason for you to freeze while we have plenty of space. We do? You can't even walk through the store right now. I agree with Candice. You need the space for your storage. And I don't wanna inconvenience anybody. Fred, you would be doing me a favor staying here. We could use someone watching the store. It'd be nice. [keys jingling] You're gonna need this. He gets his own key? It's been a very long time since I've had one of those. Are you sure? [Clio] We could use the help. Right, Candice? If it's really what you want, Clio... Then, yes, we would love to have your help, Fred, as long as you know how to make a good pot of coffee. As long as it's instant. - [Clio chuckles] - I'll keep making the coffee. Enjoy your very own space. I know I'm not the best dresser, but is it that bad? I'm giving some of your old stuff to Fred. But before you say anything, I promise I'm not giving away anything that you've worn over the past few years, or anything... Clio, it's okay, you've asked me to clean out my closet a million times. Guess it's a good thing I didn't. Hey there. Hold on now. Well, what? - [chuckles] - Gotcha. Hey, I don't know when I got this, but this is perfect for Fred. That's not yours, and I'm not giving it away. Where'd it come from? [sighs] It's my dad's. He left it the last time I saw him. I mean, I know it's just a sweater, but since I can't find the locket... Clee, I get it. I'm just glad you're starting to talk about him a little bit more. [exhales] But our elf is at home. [Mia] Okay, girls. [Olivia] I wonder what he does when we're gone. [coughs] [Simone] Can he see us in the car? Mommy, do you think Santa could see us right now? [Olivia] You're just worried because you took one of my jelly beans. [Simone] Did not. [Olivia] Did so. It doesn't matter who can see you. You always need to respect each other. Thank you. [instrumental "12 Days Of Christmas"] [Clio] Good morning! No, no, no. Keep going. You're the boss.

You all right? Yes. Mia... love of my life. My only child. Why did she run away? She didn't know I was in town. I was waiting for the perfect moment. But that moment never came. Does she know that you're sick? I found it under your truck on the ground and I meant to give it to you yesterday. But with all the excitement with you moving into the store, I-I kinda... It's okay, I understand. Have you ever thought about being a detective? [coughs] I do like donuts. Throat cancer. Oh. I'm so sorry, Fred. It's ironic, isn't it? Well, let's get you off of this freezing bench before we both have no feeling in our back sides. [coughs] Come on. [groans] [footsteps approaching] - [Fred] Hey. - Hi! - How are you? - I'm okay. I think you don't need to waste your time worrying about me. You've got a shop to run. Ah, Candice can handle it. I want to hear about Mia. How long has it been since you guys have seen each other? Thirty years. I got back from the war in '75. Couldn't even find a job. The only thing I was good at was singing. So I, I joined a jazz group. It was so good that we actually toured the country. But that meant I wasn't here. That didn't sit too well with the missus. When the group ended, so did my marriage. Divorcing your wife does not mean divorcing your child. I didn't want her to see what I'd become. I found odd jobs here and there, but I didn't even make enough money to pay rent because I had all my pension sent to Mia's mother. That left me out on the street. When my dad died... I didn't even know he was sick. He didn't tell me. Oh. That was probably the hardest thing he'd ever had to do, keeping it from you. I didn't even have time to get used to the idea of him not being around. And then all of a sudden he was gone. I promise you, if anything like that happens to you before Mia knows, she's gonna feel the same way. [exhales] We're quite a pair, the two of us. Just a couple of stubborn fools. [both laughing] - Who are you calling a fool? - You. Because you won't sing at the show. There is nothing more healing than music. You can sing joy to the world. I'm not feeling so joyful lately. Today was the first time in a year that I physically could get a sound out without sobbing. Hm. I have a long ways to go. Yeah. I haven't been on a stage in years. Well, what if I went with you to rehearsals, so that way you know you wouldn't have to be alone? [laughs] More truth be told, my soul could really use some healing right about now. [Eileen] It really was a great recipe. I guess I'm better at growing food than cooking it. I'm fine with take-out. So I saw you moved some stuff around in the shop. It looks lovely. Yeah. Thanks. Mom, can you tell me something? I'll do my best. Was it your idea or dad's to keep his cancer from me? - I better let you two talk. - No, you can stay. No, no, no, really, this is between you two. I'll be in my office. I tried to give you your space, honey, but I'm glad you want to talk about it. Mom, I need to know. When your dad got sick, at first he was sure he was gonna beat it. So was I. We didn't tell you because we didn't wanna worry you. Shop was picking up and you just got married to Jack and you were planning on starting a family. But when you realized he wasn't getting any better, why didn't you tell me then? He couldn't bear to see you upset over him. I begged him to tell you, Clio. But he was set on keeping everything normal for you. - It's what he wanted. - But that's not what I wanted. [sobs] I could've helped him! Helped you, mom! I would've done and said so much more had I known. I was robbed of dad! Don't you think I wanted to tell you? But I had to keep my word to your father. I just, I don't understand. Why did he want to shut me out? It wasn't about shutting you out. It was about him going out on his own terms. He had no control over what was happening to him, but he could control how you remember him. He didn't want you to see him suffer. He wanted it to keep that all to himself. But now I'm suffering! I know, and I am so sorry. I wish I could take your pain away. You know when they say... that you can't tell a person how to grieve, everyone grieves their own way? I couldn't tell your father how to die. I can't do this. I gotta go. No, d-don't leave like this, please. I'll be okay. I love you, mom. I gotta meet Fred. [Gayle] Quiet, people! Okay, simmer. Simmer. We have a lot of work to do. We are nowhere near our goal for the children's charity. And last night's rehearsal was not good enough for the Grinch. It was only the second rehearsal. Well, excuses don't sell tickets, do they? [gasps] Oh, that was good. Oh, that needs a shirt. Okay, quiet! Listen. We really have to step it up if we wa... Well, who do we have here? Oh! Please tell us you're here to save us, Clio! If there's anyone that can save the show, it's my friend, Fred. He's gonna be singing in my spot this year. How do you do? Show us what you've got, Fred. W-w-what, now? Well, song's not gonna sing itself, is it? [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] Right here. As we say in the business, break a leg. I have to use the restroom.

Just like their mama. Don't do that. Why do you suddenly care? You never did before. I know it's my actions that gave you those assumptions. But I care. People who care don't vanish into thin air. When I had you, I, uh, I couldn't give you what you needed... or what you deserved. I didn't wanna see that look of disappointment in your face. That wasn't disappointment. That was heartbreak. I was never disappointed in you. You would march back into town after a gig and I was so proud that you are my pop. I was eight. I didn't even know what disappointment was. This is the look of disappointment. Mia, that's why I came back, to say I'm sorry. Baby, I'm so sorry.

Mommy, look what daddy got me. [Eileen on TV] It's beautiful. [Robert on TV] Let me help you put it on. [instrumental music] [Young Clio] I'll never take it off. [Eileen] Hold right there. [mellow music] [music continues] [music continues] Clee, it's time for bed. Can't. Couch wants me to stay. You're gonna regret it tomorrow when your back is killing you. You smell like Jack. I am Jack. I love Jack. I love us. Me, too. We should have a little Jack. I would love a little Clio or a little Jack. [instrumental music] [Clio] Hi, mom. It really does look magical in here. So Christmas-y. Thank you. Fred, this is Clio's mom, Eileen. - Ma'am. - So formal. Please, call me Eileen. I'm a hugger. I hope that's okay. Yeah, works for me. I didn't know Clio hired someone new. Clio didn't tell you about Fred. Uh, Clio doesn't tell me much these days. They like to talk about me like I'm not here. Yeah. Happens to me all the time. [coughing] - [Clio] Hey. - Is he okay? Uh, Fred's not well. You have to take it easy. Hm. [Fred clears throat] How can I help, sweetheart? I've got lozenges. It's organic. I think he needs more than a cough drop, mom. Why, what's the matter? Tongue out, please. Fred, I own a health store. I'll pick out some things for you to help with your symptoms, and I'll drop them off tomorrow. How does she know what's wrong with me? Well, she took care of my dad and I didn't even know he was sick. He barely had symptoms until the very end. I'd listen to her. [Fred sighs] I've got your hot chocolate. With extra marshmallows, just like you like it. [chuckles] How do you remember that after all these years? A man never forgets the details of the best times in his life. [sighs] They look like you. Especially Olivia. She looks exactly like you looked in your fourth-grade Christmas pageant. How could you know that? You were a Christmas fairy with gold shimmering wings and a wreath on your head like a crown. You were there? I was always there. Except, the crown was a little too big. And it kept sliding down over your eyes. And you'd run around, but you couldn't see a lick. I said to myself, "Yeah, that's my daughter." Not being able to see is not gonna stop her. You just kept plowing right on through. Until I hit a tree and the entire set fell down like dominoes. I wasn't gonna mention that part. [both laughing] That's the best part of the story. Yeah, it was. Long time ago. Yeah. [clears throat] Well, um... I'm gonna head over to the diner. You're welcome to stop by if you feel compelled to do so. If not... I'll understand. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] I didn't think you were gonna come. Neither did I. Um, I took the liberty. I ordered your favorite. Thank you. And look, we're in the exact same spot where you lost your first tooth. You remember? I think it fell into my apple pie. Yeah. Well, you always did have a sweet tooth. I think you made the exact same joke when it happened. Well, at least I'm consistent. So, uh, you and your husband come here? I, I haven't seen him around. What's his name? James. He's stationed in Afghanistan. - Is he a Marine? - Yes. How about that? And you're a lawyer. Are we really gonna do this? Try to cram 30 years of my life into one meeting over a pie? I'd like it to be more than one meeting. You know, I remember the exact day you left. We were supposed to go to the lake. I was so excited because it was the first time I packed my own picnic basket. I made peanut-butter banana sandwiches and Arnold Palmers. Your favorites. And, of course, two apples because... - Gotta have your fruit. - Gotta have your fruit. That picnic basket sat by the door for a whole month. Fruit flies and all. Because I thought that if I put it away, it meant... you were never coming back. I tried to do right by you. I didn't have much. I tried to provide. But that's not what it was about for me. I was a kid. I just wanted to go to the lake and eat peanut-butter banana sandwiches with my dad. I wanna thank you for being candid with me. It's much more than I expected. It's much more than I deserve. From now on, I just wanna keep it real with each other. From now on? You make it sound like we've got a future. Isn't that why you came here? Yes. If I decide to tell the girls about you... I just need to know that you're gonna stick around this time. [sobbing] I'm... I'm not going anywhere. - Right. - I'll be here. [bells jingling] I come in peace and healing. Hi, mom. [chuckles] Hi, Eileen. You're looking a little better today, Fred. I feel a little better. Mm-hmm. These supplements will help with your symptoms, but they're no replacement for a doctor's recommendation. I'm already seeing doctors, Eileen, and I am through with it. All they wanna do is cut out part of my throat. Oh, no. They can't do that. You'll lose your voice for good. What does Mia say? [sighs] I haven't told her yet. Oh... But, Fred, you gotta tell her. I know. I just need more time. What if Mia wants me to have this operation? I've already lost everything. I cannot lose my voice. She has a right to know that you may not... And I appreciate your concern. I just need to do this on my own term. - But... - Please don't push, Clio. I know you of all people know what it's like to do something in your own time. Eileen, you've done a great service today. Don't even think about it. I always pay my debt. Fred, you don't have to d... Ladies, if you will excuse me, I have a date with my grandbabies. Fred, I'm sorry. Girls, do you remember Mr. Fred from your Christmas show? He's my daddy. That means he's our grandpa? No, Grandpa Joe is our grandpa. And Granddad Ben, from daddy. Fred was my daddy when I was your age, Olivia. And after that Grandpa Joe was my daddy. So you have two daddies and we have three grandpas? How lucky is that? Would you like to meet him? Now, I know it's a lot to take in. So if you're not ready, we can save it for another time. Why won't we wanna meet our grandpop? Grandpop. I like the sound of that. Okay, let's just get out the car. Come on, kids, let's go. Let's get out of the car. Mommy, can I have another? I think you've hit your cocoa quota for the night. - More like a year. - Whatever. That's my kind of girl. Hey, I bet you like extra marshmallows. How'd you know? Let's just call it a hunch. How come we never met you before? Well, it seems like I got myself a bit lost... for a long, long time before I found my way back. Mommy always gets lost. She asks this lady on the phone to tell her where to turn. Don't you have that? No, sweetheart, I-I don't have that lady. But I guess she would've been a great help, though. This one looks just like the one in that store on Bridge Street. What do you mean, No Place Like Home? That's where I work. Hey, I can get you a couple of ornaments if you like, uh, that sort of thing. Mommy, can grandpa borrow your phone so that lady could give him directions? I don't want him to get lost again.

Why are you here so late? Did you forget something? Yes. My manners. I shouldn't have butt into your personal life. You meant well. And I know that. Can I be honest with you? I think we've already established that. I would give anything to be in Mia's shoes. She gets her father back. And I guess that's why I'm pushing you so hard to tell her. [Clio sighs] You know, we've become so close in such a short period of time. I guess I just got a little too comfortable. Out of all the people I know, you have been more kind to me than anyone. You have earned the right to be as comfortable as you want to ask me anything you want. I just ain't gotta listen to it, though. [laughing] I'm up for a good challenge. Yeah, don't I know that? Okay, so tomorrow night my mom is gonna pick you up for the concert. So you don't have to go alone. I have to go early so I can set up. A little improvement from the Santa suit. I'd say. Well, you need something to wear tomorrow night. - Right? - Yeah. And that is somethin', all right. But you know what? It's been over 30 years since I've worn a suit. Well, my gift to you. Merry Christmas. Yeah, and that's another thing. That just reminds me that I'm way behind on my Christmas shopping. Oh, no. Fred, please. I wasn't doing this expecting anything. I want you to feel special tomorrow night. You deserve it. Why are you so good to me? Because you're the first person to help me forget about my broken heart. I didn't do that. That's the music. It does that. You know what? I think I'm ready. I think I'm ready to do the show. I knew you were gonna do the show. You didn't know I was gonna do the show. You do always get your way, don't you? I have my moments. But we're not gonna do Joy To The World. Oh, baby, we don't have to sing that. We can do a whole lot better. [piano music] [birds chirping] [instrumental music] [music continues] Uh, yeah... Well, I'll be... [comedian] My kid doesn't believe in Santa. He's a rebel without a Claus. [audience laughing] [cell phone ringing] [Eileen on phone] Hi. Clio? Mom, where are you guys? The roads are in bad shape, honey. I'm going as fast as I can. That's why I asked you to leave early. Well, I thought my dress was clean, and then it turns out I was wrong... Uh, mom, that doesn't matter. The concert is about to start. Please, hurry. I'll get him there, sweetheart. I promise. [sighs] [comedian] I just move in from the North Pole. And, boy, are my arms tired. Thank you very much. Merry Christmas, everybody. Fred, I'm here! Hey, Fred, I'm so sorry I was late. Fred? Hey. Fred, we really do have to get a move on. [intense music] Oh, my gosh. Fred! Why do you work so hard to make me look dumb? [ventriloquist doll] You think this is hard work? [audience laughing] You see why I needed you? This does not sell tickets. Oh, I'm so glad you changed your mind. He's not so bad. My cat's funnier than this guy. Maybe you should've had him perform. I asked. It was a no-go. Where's Fred? I'd like to know the same thing. - Ooh. - Ah. So much for his promises to always be available from now on. Listen, he's on his way. I just spoke to my mom... He's got you fooled, too. [sighs] Mia, he's gonna be here. Don't you get it? This is what he does. - [sighs] It's not like that. - You barely even know him. I know him well enough to know that he loves you and he loves those little girls. It's bad enough he broke my heart. I will never forgive him for breaking theirs. Mia, the girls are ready to go on. Okay. [instrumental music] [applauding, cheering] Cute! [cell phone ringing] Mom, what's going on? Sweetheart... Fred's not coming. When I went to pick him up, he was unconscious. What happened? Oh, my gosh. Is he okay? Yeah, he's awake now. But the paramedics came and rushed him to the hospital. But he told me to tell you to go on without him. Not gonna happen. [Clio on phone] Thanks, mom. [music continues] Jack! Come here. [mellow music] - Hi. - Hi. - Let me take this. - Thank you. Hey. [gasps] Hey! Um. Ahem. I'm sorry about the concert. I'm not. I'd rather be here with you. How are my girls? Did they light up the stage? They stole the show. [Clio chuckles] Oh... [sighs] W-what about Mia? Was she mad when I didn't show up? [knocking on door] The nurses are bringing you some dinner. Ah. I'm not hungry. Fred, you've got to eat. My body's been fightin' a war a long time and it's managed to survive without the aid of hospital food. Fred, is this gonna be our second fight? Because if it is, I will fight you. No, baby. I'm done fighting. I'm tired of messin' up everything good in my life. I thought if I made amends with Mia, I could sing on stage for one last time and go in peace. What if there was another way? What do you mean? [instrumental music] [laughing] [cell phone buzzing] - Hello? - Candice, we need your help. I got it. We can do that. [applauding] Could everyone please take your seats? I said sit! Well, we had an act scheduled earlier today and they... Something came up and they couldn't do it. But we are nothing, if not, flexible. I think what you're about to see will more than make up for that. - Candice? - Oh, I got this. [Gayle] For the final song of the night, ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Clio and Fred.

Oh, my gosh! [cheering, applauding] - [crackling] - [groaning] I'm ready to join the Fred Fan Club. Well, it's about time. Go get your things from back stage. Hurry. I'd say that was a success. Yeah, it's probably due to my glamorous appearance. [laughs] - Grandpa! - Hey! Hello, babies! Hey, baby, baby! Come here, you little nugget. Come on, girls, let's give them a few minutes, okay? [both sobbing] Why didn't you tell me? Because I didn't want... to ask you to forgive me by dangling my cancer over your head. I just wanted to be fair. What did I tell you at the diner? That how you feel wasn't up to me. I didn't forget. I didn't want your worrying... to be the reason you accepting me back. Daddy... I've been worried about you since I was eight years old. I wish I could go back and start all over again. We've lost so much time. The time that's gone by doesn't matter anymore, okay? You're here right now. And I will take any moment I can have with you. Worry and all. I love you. I love you, too. What cards do you have? I'm not telling you what cards I've got. - That's cheating. - Oh. Looks like she forgives him. Being in the hospital has its perks. Well, technically, since we're in the hospital, too, will you forgive me? Oh, honey! I've been awful. You've been mourning. We both have. I'm just glad to have you back. Being sad is so lonely. Tell me about it. Maybe we can start cooking together. As long as we can use real cheese. - You got it. - That's good. Because I'm hoping to be cooking for one more. [laughs] What? - [squeaks] - Whoa! I take it you told her? - Yeah. - [laughs] [indistinct chatter] Can we come in now? You guys are taking forever. - [laughs] - Come on in. I've got a surprise for you over in that corner. Ooh! Ms. Eileen was nice enough to make sure they made it here. - Thank you, grandpop. - You're welcome. Since daddy's not home, will you put these on our tree for us, right at the very top? What do you say, pop? You ready to come home? Yeah. [knocking on door] Come in. Hey. How are you feeling, Fred? Well, a lot better now that the whole gang's here. I'm so bummed I didn't get a chance to see you in your tux. He looked very handsome. I don't know how you could tell that. When you found me, I was sprawled out under the piano. And I'm sorry. That reminds me. Clio, look in that pocket. [instrumental music] [gasps] You said you lost a locket. Oh, my gosh! I found it under the piano just before I passed out. [gasps] Thank you! This is all I wanted for Christmas. Thank you so much! We looked everywhere. How did we miss it? I don't know! Sometimes we find things when we need them the most. [sighs] - [knocking on door] - Hey, doc. Oh, well, you look like you're feeling better. You gave us quite a scare. Yeah, you're not gonna get rid of me just yet. Why did he collapse, doctor? Well, maybe it'd be better if we spoke in private? Uh, no, no. This is my family. Whatever you have to say to me, you can say it in front of them. Okay. Well, sometimes pain medication can cause a rapid drop in blood pressure which, in turn, will induce fainting. See? I told you it's not serious. Well, your condition is very serious, Fred, which is why I came here to talk to you about a treatment that I found. No. Look, I'm not doin' surgery. I already told you that. That's not happenin'. It's a new trial that I think you'll be a perfect candidate for. It's showing significant improvement in tumor shrinkage. Basically, no side effect at all. That sounds too good to be true. Dad, listen to her, please. It specifically targets your type of cancer. But I do need to tell you that this is not considered a cure. Okay, at this point our focus is just to give you some more time. I just got you back. I can't lose you all over again so soon. For the first time in a long time, doc, I-I got hope. I'm in. I got a lot more to live for now. Merry Christmas, Fred. Merry Christmas, doc. Enjoy your time with your family. Merry Christmas, everyone. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. So... what song will we be singing next year?
