We can never know what really happened in the past, but there are people all over America and probably the world who dress up on the weekends in the clothes of a favourite period to try and re-create the lives of men and women from a distant time. Yeah, we're getting one more rehearsal for framing here. Yeah, is the camera ready? History has an imperfect memory. It may be hard to believe, but a Frenchman, an aristocrat named Lafayette, was one of America's first and most popular heroes. Without him, this country might not have won its war of independence. Millions of people stood waiting on roadsides and cheered Lafayette like a rock star when he travelled through America 50 years after the revolution he helped win. How did we forget one of our founding fathers? If you even recognise the name Lafayette, it's probably a vague memory from a storybook or maybe you've walked down a street with that name or driven through a town named Lafayette, Fayetteville, or something like that. There are more than 50 of them around the country. Did you ever wonder why? France and America have always had a strange love/hate relationship. [Dialogue dubbed in French] Neither side likes to admit it, but each defines itself, at least partly, by the other. Americans say the French are snobs, but admire their sense of style. The French think Americans are violent and uncivilised, but love to imitate them. It's really common values that have always bound us together. And made us allies when it really mattered. Action. Maybe the Marquis de Lafayette is this figure from the distant past. A foreigner, a Frenchman, can tell us something important about ourselves and help us remember a time when America became the symbol of freedom in the world. Following his trail into the past, we might even understand more about where we're headed now. Cut. Lafayette left us part of the story in his memoirs and letters. I was born in the small village of Chavaniac just before the death of my father. In the seven years war with England. So many Lafayettes have died fighting for France. That I was baptised was the protection of every saint who might guard me in battle. Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert Du Motier... Most historians agree about the basic facts in Lafayette's life. The differences are mainly about which incidents they choose to emphasise or ignore. His father was killed in the battle of Minden when he was two years old, and his mother sort of retreated to Paris and very rarely came home to Auvergne. He is a natural boy. He was educated in the countryside. He lived with the peasants. It was a lonely childhood, and Lafayette fancied himself, even at that young age, as the gallant knight out against all bad things the could happen to people. He kept that image of himself throughout his life. At 8 years of age, my heart beat when I heard of a wild beast terrorising our neighbourhood. The hope of meeting it was the object of all my walks in the woods. Lafayette may be forgotten other places, but you can still find traces of him in the French province of the Auvergne. They hold a festival in his memory every summer. It celebrates 18th-century village life and commemorates the birth of their Marquis... But they don't tell you much about his life after he left the countryside. When I was 11, my mother sent for me to come and live with her in Paris. Young Lafayette is in for a surprise; his mother lives at the Palais Du Luxembourg, one of the grandest homes in Paris. Shortly thereafter, his mother died, and Lafayette became a very wealthy orphan. At the age of 14, Gilbert is already a wealthy and eligible bachelor. He's introduced to the charming Adrienne de Noailles, from the most well-connected family in France. It was towards the close of 1773 that monsieur de Lafayette would meet us sometimes, either at home or out walking in the park. She was fascinated by this man. It's very interesting to see how she became the important person of his life. Sabine Renault-Sabloniere is a great-great-great- great-great-granddaughter. Of Lafayette and Adrienne. She's writing a book about them and the story of their unlikely partnership in two revolutions. [Sabloniere speaking French] "Our family's elegant townhouse, the hotel de Noailles, has gardens looking out on the Seine." [Sabloniere speaking French] I was only 12 years old when my father proposed monsieur de Lafayette to my dear mother as a match for me or one of my sisters. Gilbert was already in possession of a large fortune, one of the largest in France, which my mother looked upon as a dangerous gift. But from the first moment of their acquaintance, she saw in him the qualities which others had yet to discover. I was 14 when we married; He was 16. A great chance in his life is this wife, his woman... Adrienne de Noailles. It was an arranged marriage who become a beautiful love story. Married into this illustrious family, Lafayette was taken to the balls of Marie Antoinette. My wife's family wish to obtain a place for me at their side, but it was impossible for me to bend to the guises of the court or to the chance of a supper with the queen. I have still less to say relating to my so-called entrance into the world or the brief moment of favour I enjoyed. On one occasion, the shy Lafayette is singled out to dance with the young queen. At some point, the story goes, Marie Antoinette stops the dance and laughs at him, as the whole court joins in. Lafayette's friends never let him forget it. At a masked ball, Lafayette lets his disguise slip on purpose, just as he's passing the Comte de Provence, the future King Louis XVIII, and the very man his family wants to use to launch Gilbert's career at court. The Comte de Provence was bragging about his wonderful memory. And Lafayette said to him, "you know, "memory is a fool's substitute for wit." One didn't say things like this to a prince of the blood. Lafayette knew exactly what he was doing. He cut himself off from life at court. Teenage defiance became a form of revolution. Lafayette's family went back 7 centuries as a military family, the noblesse d'epee... "The nobility of the sword." Lafayette was raised on stories of his family's glory at war, and he needed to find his own way to that glory. [Sabloniere speaking French] "August 8, 1775. "My darling, there is word that the Duke of Gloucester, "the brother of England's King George, may dine with us tonight. "It could prove lively as, apparently, "he takes the side of the American insurgents just to irk his brother." The Duke of Gloucester was a radical rake who was very much for the American revolutionaries, and he described the ideals for which the American revolutionaries were fighting: Human rights, liberty, equality, democracy. Lafayette never forgot that dinner. He described it as a turning point in his life. From the moment I heard the name "America," I loved it. I burned with a desire to spill my blood for her. Lafayette was caught up in the enlightenment principles expressed in the declaration of independence, a text that Lafayette was very familiar with. Late in 1776, Benjamin Franklin arrives in Paris as an envoy, to help win France's support for the American cause. So does another American, on a secret mission. The United States congress sent a recruiter to Paris. His name was Silas Deane. Lafayette was looking for a future, and Silas Deane agreed to send Lafayette to the continental army with the commission of a Major General. At the time of the beginning of the American revolution, he understood that there was a political opportunity. He wasn't able to have glory in France, but it was possible to have glory in America. Lafayette bought a ship, outfitted it with cannon, named it "la Victoire." The family was very embarrassed by what Lafayette wanted to do. His father-in-law was close to the court and close to the King, and when the King learnt that Lafayette was going to leave France to go to the states, he tried to prevent him. He was a knight-errant on his white horse, and he wasn't going to be deterred by the King or anybody else. [Sabloniere speaking French] In April, Gilbert carried out the scheme he had been forming for 6 months past of going to serve the cause of independence in America. I still loved him tenderly. It was a very long and arduous voyage. It was 6 weeks. Ocean crossings were horrible in those days. Lafayette appears to have been seasick most of that time. He was a terrible sailor. They were in very heavy seas, and he didn't begin his first letter to his wife until he was about halfway there. In his letter to Adrienne, he said, "I don't understand people who like the sea. It's so sad and I am ill." "The sea, the sea, always the sea, every day alike. It's so lonely here." He's talking to his wife as if she should feel some pity for him, having left her without a word when she was pregnant with their child. But, after a fortnight, he was not so ill, and he learnt English because he's very clever. Most of the French officers didn't do the same. He learnt English. He learnt English because, he explains, that you have to understand the people of liberty. "My dear Adrienne, "I go to defend liberty as a friend. "The happiness of America is intimately tied "to the happiness of all mankind. "One day she will become the safe haven "of tolerance, equality, and peaceful liberty." He was a visionary when he said to Adrienne... When he said such things as America was born for glory and prosperity, it's really incredible because how could he think of that 230 years ago? When Lafayette's ship arrived off the coast of South Carolina, they couldn't get into the port of Charleston because it was being heavily patrolled by the British. So they sailed north to look for a safe harbour to get into. They land at a plantation near Charleston and soon start off on the 700-mile journey to Pennsylvania. Lafayette and his men travel for more than a month by carriage, on horseback, and finally on foot. It's not until July 27, 1777 that Lafayette and the 6 other exhausted French soldiers arrive in the capital city of Philadelphia. He finds out where the continental congress is meeting, walks up, and knocks on the door of independence hall. They were met by the head of the secret committee for foreign soldiers, and he just told them to go away and he turned his back on them and walked back inside. So many French officers had presented themselves to the continental army for commissions that the congress was really sick of them, and so Lafayette and his fellow officers, having braved the Atlantic and an incredible march from Charleston to Philadelphia, were treated like the worst kind of adventurers. I entreated his deputy, a Mr Lovell, to return to congress with the message, "after the sacrifices I have made, "I have the right to be accepted as a volunteer and serve at my own expense." A delegation came to him the next day and said, "we're very sorry that we treated you as we did." By then, they had gotten a letter of recommendation from Benjamin Franklin saying, "he will help our cause no end, so please treat him well." In fact, he said, "please... Don't get him killed, but let him learn his glory on some important occasion." Men like Washington, like Franklin, could immediately realise that this was a person who could speak at the highest levels of the French government, who'd become an advocate for us. We've come to see General Washington. After his noble manoeuvres at Panton and Princeton, General Washington came to Philadelphia, and I beheld for the first time this great man. Present arms. It had been a very bad day for Washington. He had been told that 18,000 British regulars were on their way to invade Philadelphia. So to meet yet another French officer, this one now a Major General who was 19 years old, was the perfect end to a perfectly bad day. You are Lafayette? I am, sir. Lafayette, of course, was thrilled. Attention. Maybe it starts out as a polite gesture to the rich kid with connections, but Lafayette's modesty makes a good first impression. Washington gives the teenager. A chance to prove himself when the continental army marches out to stop the 8,000 British and Hessian soldiers at Brandywine Creek. The first column appeared just up the stream from us. General Charles Cornwallis and his men advanced across the plain and opened a brisk fire of muskets and artillery. I was granted permission to ride out and support General Sullivan on our right. I arrived to find the enemy had crossed the ford. Our cause scarcely had time to form itself on the line. Get back there now. Stand your ground. We don't want this... Get back in line, damn you. Lafayette hadn't noticed that he was wounded until blood started gushing from his boot. He had it attended to on the battlefield and continued to fight, and helped manage a very, very chaotic retreat while he was wounded. The battle is lost, allowing the British to take Philadelphia, but Lafayette is carried from the field at Brandywine a hero. Cut. Cut. The way you did it before. Huh? The handsome young General captures the public's imagination. His fame spreads through the country and back across the Atlantic. [Sabloniere speaking French] "September 12, 1777. "Dear Adrienne, "I will begin by telling you I am in good health "because I have to wind up by informing you that yesterday "I was honoured by my lords, the "English, with a musket ball in my leg. "But, my dear heart, it is a mere trifle. "Neither bone nor nerve were touched; I came off lightly." When news from my husband arrived, it gave me enormous comfort, at first. Gilbert wrote to me about his wound at the battle of Brandywine. I need not tell you my feelings on receiving that news. At least my mother was able to keep me from hearing the report of his death, which was spread about at that time by the English. "November 27, 1777. "Paris is ringing with reports of the first battle "in which Gilbert has brought glory to the name of France. "My husband's fame is spreading through the country." The very people who had most blamed his rash adventure now applaud him. Valley Forge is what most people think of when it comes to soldiers suffering during America's war of independence. It's mythologised in movies going all the way back to D.W. Griffith, the King of epic silent films. The real winter was probably more horrible than we can even imagine. Lafayette makes a point of living there with his men and gives a vivid account in his memoirs. The army settled into its melancholy winter quarters. The unfortunate soldiers were in want of everything. They had no coats or shoes. Their feet and legs froze till they became black, and it was often necessary to amputate them. The army remained for days without provisions, and many deserted to the countryside. The American public was not supporting the continental army any more. The congress and the states were not well supporting the continental army. They were expecting them basically to just hang on, just to survive, to keep the continental army together. Until the British lost their will to stay. And Washington, while his men were freezing, was told to come to the defence of Philadelphia, and he had to tell the congress, "it would be nice if we had clothes or food. It would be nice if our men weren't dying of exposure and eating their shoes." Washington is coming under attack in congress. A cabal seeks to replace him as commander-in-chief. Lafayette, tempted with offers from Washington's enemies, remains steadfast and comes to Washington's defence. "Dear General Washington, "I don't need telling you how I am sorry "to be the one to bring it to your attention. "There are open dissensions in congress, "parties who hate each other as much as the enemy. "My dear Marquis," "what you have just conveyed to me is fresh proof of your friendship. "It's well known I have not sought for this place. "If I am displeasing to the nation, I will retire, "but until then, I will oppose these intrigues." "General, I see plainly that America "could be betrayed by her own sons. "These are jealous men, perhaps secret friends to the British; "stupid men who, without knowing a single word about war, undertake to judge you." Washington's opponents in congress were trying to remove him from command. "My dearest friend, I have no doubt of your loyalty." Some of this group invited Lafayette to join them in a toast, and while they all had their glasses raised, Lafayette added, "and to his excellency, General Washington." Lafayette's support in that very difficult time helped to seal their relationship. Washington learnt at Valley Forge that Lafayette could be trusted. Astonishingly, the unemotional George Washington, who keeps everyone at arm's length, expresses a fondness for Lafayette. Washington has no son, and the young Frenchman no father. Lafayette now becomes a part of Washington's inner circle, what he calls his family. A great friendship develops between these men. They discuss the principles of the American revolution. By this time, the growing fame of a Frenchman in the American ranks and close to Washington has become an embarrassment to the British. They'd love to capture and humiliate Lafayette. Now they see their chance. In the late spring of 1778, Lafayette is given a command befitting a real General: To lead a scouting expedition of 2,000 men near the British stronghold in Philadelphia. These English Generals, Howe and Clinton, felt so certain of my capture that they sent out invitations to a fete in Philadelphia at which, they said, "Lafayette will be present." "Sir, your detachment is a very valuable one. "Any accident would be a severe blow to this army. "You will therefore use every "possible precaution for its security "and to guard against a surprise. A stationary post is inadvisable." Still an impetuous teenager at heart, Lafayette ignores his commander's advice not to stay in one place too long. He soon has reason to regret his decision. Sir. We camped on the 18th of May at Barren Hill, on a good elevation with a small road down to the river in the rear. March. On the morning of the 20th, I was informed that the red dragoons were approaching. I first heard that I was surrounded in the presence of my troops. Several officers whom I had dispatched as scouts declared we were cut off from the road, and they had been unable to find an escape route. I attacked from among the trees and behind stone walls. Fire. I proceeded onto the small path down to the river road. The time the enemy wasted in reconnoitring... looking for an ambush... I used to evade the trap. Lafayette, still only 20 years old, had proved himself as an American soldier who thinks on his feet. But Washington was convinced his protege would be more useful to him as a lobbyist to the court of Versailles. Lafayette is seen as a key to the French treasury and French supply, the things that the American army needs so badly. And he's sent to open the doors that would give us the financial support, the weaponry, the troops, and the navy that we didn't have, because, remember, given his birth, his connections, he walks right into court and can speak to the people at the highest levels. By the time Lafayette returns, there was already a treaty of alliance between America and France. The French realised that these Americans might have a chance of winning. That said, the extent of their support was not yet clear. Lafayette basically camped on the doorstep of Versailles to make sure that America got as much aid as possible. I have often said to myself that to clothe the army of the United States, I would willingly have unfurnished the palace of Versailles. Gilbert. At first, the King orders him under house arrest... A slap on the wrist for going to America without permission... Then, Lafayette is welcomed at court. Adrienne is often left waiting as he gets swept up in the festive balls and other diversions. She knew that men who were at court were out of the house and that they had mistresses. Her sister tells her that there are some rumours saying that many women are interested in him and that... he doesn't refuse. So little by little, she will accept, you know, this kind of life. Amidst the tumultuous scenes that now occupied me, I do not forget our revolution, whose ultimate success still appears as uncertain as ever. With the King's promises of 10,000 French troops and a fleet from the west indies, Lafayette sails back to America. But there's no guarantee that the reinforcements will arrive. I am welcomed in Boston with a salute of guns, with the ringing of the church bells, with a band marching ahead, and with cheering from the assembled multitude. I await the arrival of the French troops, who, as it turns out, will be commanded not by me, but by the Count de Rochambeau. Lafayette dreams of leading the charge that will drive the British from New York City, but Washington has a different mission in mind for the Marquis. Lafayette is sent south with the Virginia militia to fight his old enemy, the English General Lord Charles Cornwallis. This was not only Washington's home state, it was the home of Mount Vernon. Members of Virginia society begged him to send someone senior to Lafayette, and Washington wrote them back that they were really underestimating the General that he'd sent to their rescue. "Richmond, Virginia, "May 6, 1781. "Dear General Washington, "was I to actually fight a battle I will be cut to pieces, "the militia dispersed, and the arms lost? "Was I to decline fighting, Virginia "would think herself given up. "I am, therefore, determined to skirmish, "but not to engage too far. I am not strong enough even to get beaten." Lafayette, he fight not in the French way, not in the English way, not in the Prussian way. He fight like the Indian: You attack and you return. When he has to fight, again, Cornwallis says, "I will take the boy," and in effect takes the boy. In June, Washington sends reinforcements. Lafayette sets off after Cornwallis with 5,000 men across Virginia to Yorktown on Chesapeake Bay. Lafayette thought it would be very important to get accurate information about what was happening within Cornwallis' compound. Lafayette sent a number of spies, one of which was a slave named James Armistead. Armistead, James Armistead... An African-American slave... Is one of the first known American secret agents. James infiltrates the British camp, he feeds Cornwallis false information, and tells Lafayette what the British General is planning. Cornwallis was an extremely competent officer, and yet, he was ultimately outmanoeuvred by this young French General. Washington learns Lafayette has Cornwallis pinned down on the Virginia coast and races south, but he fears the promised French fleet will arrive too late to prevent the English from escaping by sea. On August 14th, 25 French warships are sighted at the mouth of the Chesapeake River. Thanks in part to Lafayette's diplomacy, Comte de Grasse, the Admiral of the French fleet, arrives in time to attack the English flotilla that has come to rescue Cornwallis. Admiral de Grasse chased the British fleet off and back to New York. Then Cornwallis had no avenue of retreat from Yorktown. Before Washington can reach Virginia, Admiral de Grasse wants the Marquis to lead an attack right away and finish off Cornwallis. Many more of Lafayette's men would have died had they undertaken the siege when de Grasse insisted that they do so. Lafayette had grown up in a very meaningful way in the course of this revolutionary war. When he came to America, he was full of vinegar and out for glory. He really wanted to become famous, but he had become so attached to his troops and so attached to the American cause that he insisted that they wait until Washington and Rochambeau arrived with the troops from the north. Lafayette is given a place of glory after all... Commanding the American forces closest to the enemy's outer defences. They bravely charge, the French way, without any bullets in their guns, taking the fort at Yorktown with fixed bayonets. As the British surrender, marching between the lines of French and American soldiers, I see they make a clear point of looking only at the French. Standing with my American soldiers, of course, I order the drum major to play "Yankee doodle." The English all turn their heads and surrender their weapons to this American tune. When the war is over, Lafayette returns to the Virginia capital and wins an appeal for the emancipation of his former spy, James Armistead. To honour the General, James takes "Lafayette" as his new last name. Gilbert arrived unexpectedly in Paris on the 21st of January, 1782. Everyone who was there still remembers the enthusiasm at the time of his triumphant return. He is a sort of pop star of history. The women want to kiss his boots when he is on his white horse. There was no TV in that time, so just imaging, just coming back from the United States, he was recognised on the street in Paris. Lafayette is greeted as the hero of two worlds by a crowd that has gathered in the street outside his home. [Sabloniere speaking French] I found myself drawn to him with a new intensity, just from the joy of having him back again after so many adventures and so much glory. The feelings were so overpowering that for several months, I felt ready to faint every time he left the room. I gave a speech at which a French woman stood up and said, "wasn't Lafayette just a lucky idiot?" There's a school of thought in France that Lafayette just fell into wonderful positions, it was just a lucky life. But the fact is that Lafayette was a very serious man. When he came back after Yorktown to France, he tried to solidify the American victory and the French victory in the American cause. Lafayette is impatient to see France transformed by the democratic ideas he has embraced. But first, he writes to Washington, passionately urging his mentor and dearest friend to perfect the American experiment in democracy by removing the taint of slavery. Lafayette is a man of the freedom, and he has written many letters to Washington to ask Washington to stop slavery in United States. "My dear General, "permit me to propose a plan which might be greatly beneficial "to the black part of mankind. "Let us unite in purchasing a small estate "where we may try the experiment to free the negroes." And Washington says, "who will work if we have not slaves?" In the cause of my black brethren, I most decidedly side against the white part of mankind. Whatever be the complexion of the enslaved, it does not alter the complexion of the crime which the enslaver commits, a crime much blacker than any African face. Lafayette, with Adrienne, asks the French ministry to free the French slaves of Guiana. And they learn to the slave to become free servant and not slaves. We purchased a plantation, la Belle Gabrielle, to give an example of gradual emancipation. Every just and liberal idea my husband had found a place in my heart, too. When he struggled against slavery, she herself managed that property, la Belle Gabrielle. Adrienne shared all his struggles. He couldn't do anything without asking her to help him. Lafayette relentlessly pursued his commitment to freedom, but his heroic efforts to bring democracy to France were to unleash forces beyond his control. This statue of Lafayette, a gift from American schoolchildren, once stood in the very centre of Paris, a site visited every year by millions of people. In the 1980s, the statue was moved to this out-of-the-way spot. Lafayette's uncertain place in French history can be traced to his role in the French revolution. He helps to get it started just a few years after he returns from America. Lafayette want to take this model of success to import it in France because he wanted to be the French Washington. "My dear General Washington, "our revolution is getting on as well as it can, "with a nation that has swallowed up liberty all at once and is still liable to mistake licentiousness for freedom." In 1789, Lafayette's friend Thomas Jefferson, the American ambassador, helps him draft the declaration of the rights of man... What may be Lafayette's greatest contribution to the cause of democracy, a vision of human rights as the core value of a society. But within a few days of its release, the people of Paris, inflamed by more radical voices, storm the Bastille prison... A symbol of the King's tyranny... And parade through the streets with heads impaled on their spears. Lafayette takes charge of a national guard responsible for restoring order. And finds himself in an untenable position. Lafayette was really caught in the middle of the French revolution. He's sort of a tragic figure in that way. He was caught between the monarchists on the right and the populists on the left. His efforts to bring the two sides together. Are played out in 3 memorable days. A huge crowd of women marches to Versailles and threatens the queen, dramatically exposing Lafayette's precarious position as both a champion of freedom and a figure of authority. [Sabloniere speaking French] Lafayette's dramatic gesture achieves a momentary truce. On the first anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, a quarter of a million people rally around Lafayette and his plan for a constitution to give them liberty and a King to protect order. They celebrate on a field where the Eiffel Tower stands today. It's a moment absolutely magic, the reconciliation of all the French. This great fete de la federation, a celebration, and all the French coming from everywhere are in a great happiness. And you have the King with a constitution; well, you have, of course, Lafayette, who is the hero of this great success. He had, really, a very charismatic personality, and that's why, at the beginning of the French revolution, he had so much influence. But Lafayette, in his thirst for glory, has put himself so much in front of everything and hasn't been... Clever enough to manage the revolution to go in a certain way. A year later, Lafayette is overwhelmed by the violent forces of revolution he's been trying to keep in check. Radical factions incite an angry mob to riot in the same field where they had cheered Lafayette. Someone fires a gun at him. They miss, but his troops open fire on the crowd. There's still a dispute over who gave the order. He couldn't hold the ends together. Because France had so much more to revolt against than the Americans did. The revolution spins out of control. Thousands of people have already escaped to nearby countries. In the next year and a half, nearly 3,000 more... Including Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette... Will die on the guillotine. Lafayette, now viewed as a traitor by both sides, tries to escape, hoping to reach America. But he's taken prisoner by the Austrians, whose Emperor... Francis II, brother of Marie Antoinette... despises Lafayette for inspiring a democratic wave that's sweeping over Europe. Lafayette ends up in a series of prisons, moving further east in Europe until he finally ends up in Olmutz, in what today we would call the Czech Republic. Adrienne, like most aristocrats, awaits her own inevitable arrest. She assumes she will follow her mother and sister to the guillotine. George Washington, now President of the United States, tries in vain to help her. She is imprisoned for 3 long years. Adrienne is finally released as the terror ends. As soon as she's free, she begs the Emperor of Austria to let her join Lafayette in prison, and Adrienne took with her. Their two daughters. They enable me to live again, but they are paying the price, especially my dear, dear Adrienne. I have always respected her intelligence and her courage, but here, I have time to appreciate the strength of her character. The cell is poisoning Adrienne, making her sicker every day, but she never falters. I like these words of madame de Stael to Adrienne. "Madame... The constant support of Washington and the Americans finally brought about our release. When he was in prison, then in exile, it is Adrienne who became a real political woman, went to see Napoleon to negotiate for Lafayette to be allowed to go back to France. But her illness only left them a few more years. They spent these last years together at la grange, one of her family's estates, just outside Paris. Lafayette wrote to a close friend, describing Adrienne's last words. Gilbert, there was a time after you first came back from America and I felt so attracted to you. How lucky that passion should have been my duty. Will you give me your blessing? You're not a Christian. You're Fayettist. Me, too. I am all yours. When Lafayette died about 30 years later, he was wearing a portrait of Adrienne in a locket around his neck. But Lafayette did live to see how democracy had been brought to life in the United States. On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the revolution, President James Monroe invited General Lafayette to return to America... A unifying hero who everybody in America can thank for their country's independence. Sometimes I do these collections of essays... Sarah Vowell, the American author, like Lafayette's descendant, Sabine Renault-sabloniere, has fallen in love with the story of this man who devoted his life to the fight for democracy. We're here in New York harbour, and on August 16, 1824, this elderly French gentleman I think you've heard of arrived in the harbour here, and 80,000 people are here to welcome him. And the population of New York city at the time was 120,000 so that's two-thirds of the population of New York is here. - Two-third of the population? - Yeah. It's incredible. You know, when the Beatles came in 1964, and there was all the hoopla? Like, compared to Lafayette, you know, the Beatles thing is just, like, a couple of girls picking up 4 guys from the airport. It's hard to overstate how beloved this man was, and this marks the beginning of this 13-month victory lap around America, where he goes to all of the then-24 states. Lafayette's return is a moment when the country can re-focus on what brought it together in the first place. The congress has this banquet for Lafayette, and he says, "someday America will save the world." And I think, while he's there and says these things, he makes everyone around him want to live up to it. Lafayette uses the tour to ask Americans if their country is living up to its promise. He returns to his beloved Virginia, where one of the biggest crowds in the tour gathers for a rally at the state capital. Lafayette suddenly stops the parade and steps out of his carriage as he recognises a face in the crowd. It's his former spy... James Armistead Lafayette, now a free man. In tears, the two embrace while the whole city of slaveholders looks on. Just before he sails, Lafayette visits the tomb of George Washington at mount Vernon. With his son, George Washington Lafayette, by his side, the old man kneels to scoop something up before they depart. When he came back from Virginia, he took with him some earth, and he wanted to be buried in this earth. So he does lie next to Adrienne in American soil.
