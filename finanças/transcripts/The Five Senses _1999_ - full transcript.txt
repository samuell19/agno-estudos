SHE WAS WITH THAT GIRL, YOUR MASSAGE LADY'S KID. Rachel? I RAN INTO THEM ON THE ELEVATOR, then I watched them go into the park together. I NEVER LIKED THAT GIRL. Who's to say she didn't just throw the kid in a hole? THAT'S A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY. SHE'S EVIL. She's a 16-year-old girl. WELL, IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG. MAYBE THEY'LL FIND HER. NO. THEY WON'T FIND HER. I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT ME HERE, BUT, UH... I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. I WANT TO HELP YOU. YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP ME. YOU WANT ME TO FORGIVE YOU. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHOSE FAULT IT IS. I DON'T BLAME YOU. AFTER YOU LEFT... I PRAYED. I HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN A REALLY LONG TIME. I MEAN, I'M NOT SOMEBODY... BUT WHEN I DID... I KNEW IT.

She was found this afternoon on a search through the construction site across the road from where she disappeared.

( thunder rolling ) ( laughing ) ( couple talking on TV ) ( man talking ) Newscaster: ...reported to be fine despite her ordeal and is now resting at home.
