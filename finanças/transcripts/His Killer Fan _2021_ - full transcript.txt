Hey. It's time to wake up. There you are. Baby, I need you to listen to me. Just tell me you love me, and then we get out of here and everything will be perfect. I don't love you. You're crazy. Don't say that. You don't mean that. Only for you, only for you I wrote that song for you. I've lived my whole life for you, and now you just wanna throw me away? I'm sorry, Josh. I guess we're breaking up. ♪ I lived ♪ ♪ for someone like you ♪ ♪ to come and take out the blue ♪ ♪ all I know is ♪ ♪ I need something new ♪ ♪ My lonely heart needs you ♪ -It's okay, mom. -♪ filling the hole ♪ Cheers, Dr. Dawson. I just can't believe he's gone. Your dad was the best, Kaylee. I can't imagine how your mom must feel. If I couldn't be with the love of my life, I just wouldn't want to live anymore. Hey, did you like my song? The one that I sang earlier? Yeah, it was pretty. He would have loved it. Do you think that I sang it okay? What? I mean, I felt good about it, but I just couldn't really get a read on the audience. Uh... Yeah. I don't know, Ari. I mean, I'm sure you were great. I've been a little distracted. I'm sorry. Of course. It's just that I'm practicing for this competition on wxpm, where I get a chance to sing that song live on stage with Josh Halliday. Josh who? Josh Halliday. Only the greatest musician of all time, and the most important man in my life. Oh. Right. Well, I guess I haven't heard of him. That's because you have been living under a med school rock. His music's just helped me through some really rough times. I just thought maybe it could help you too. I'm sorry. I... I don't know what I'd do without you. Mom? Mom? What are you doing? Hey honey. I was hoping to surprise you. Yeah, well I’m surprised all right. I'm just glad your dad isn't here to see this mess. I am proud of you for trying, and I know he would be too. So, take out? Yeah, I'm on it. Should I be concerned? Foanio's mentioned you've ordered from them about 50 times this past month. Hey, don't judge. I'm just a loyal customer. And lucky for them, I have subpar cooking skills. Well, first thing tomorrow, I am going to the grocery store. Is there something special you want for dinner this week? Don't you have to head back for classes on Monday? Uh... I've decided to take the semester off. I'm worried about you. This big house, alone. Honey. You know, I love having you here. And I love this big house. Sweetie, if this is about what happened with your dad... Mom, stop. It's not that. I just need a minute to catch my breath. So how'd she take the news? Okay, I guess. Well, drink up, k. Yeah, I think I'm too tired for wine, Ari. You have to. We're celebrating. Hmm? Celebrating what? That your best friend is going to be performing live, in front of a concert audience tomorrow night. What? The Josh Halliday thing? You won? Mm-hmm. Ari, that's amazing. I am so proud of you. It gets better. The winner also gets two front row tickets and backstage passes to meet Josh Halliday. K, you have to come. Oof. I want to, Ari. It's just, I mean, I just got back. I feel like I should be spending time with my mom. K, you have to come. You're my bestie. I need you. Please. Okay. That should loosen you up. Thank you. Oh my god! What? What is it? Oh. I know, right. Josh hasn't been single in like a year. Not since the sky's the limit tour. You get alerts for this kind of stuff? Yeah. I know everything there is to know about my man. Somebody pinch me. I was kidding. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. Ariana Kent, I won the contest. Thank you. Door's open, come on. After you, superstar. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Josh Halliday. Thank you. Let's get straight to it. We have a very special quest tonight. As you all know, -we had a contest on the wxpm- -hey, remember, no matter what happens, you are talented, you're beautiful. And no matter what, you'll always be my best friend. But tonight, we have a very, very special guest. The second I heard her sing, I knew that she was the one to help me with his next song. Please welcome to the stage, Ariana Kent. Come on up. Go, Ari!

Give it up one more time for Ariana Kent! Are you ready for the next song? This isn't a very good angle. I wish you could have gotten higher. I'm sorry. Next time I'll try to remember to wear platforms. Thanks. You might want to slow down. Okay mom. Hey, I'm Josh. Right. I'm... With me, she was just leaving. Thanks so much for letting me drag you all the way out here. I know how much you hate this kind of music. It means a lot to me that you could stick it out long enough to hear me sing. Ariana you were on fire tonight. And the fans loved you. And I know you don't like the music, but, was it still fun to see your friend sing? I didn't say that. I am... Poor Kaylee he understands. Kaylee, huh? Mm-hm. Are you sure you have to leave, cause... I love your music, and how you write all of your own songs. I write my own songs too. There's actually the song that I've been working on, and I'm playing it tomorrow night for my fans. And I would love to get your opinion on the lyrics. It's all about loneliness, and how you just love someone so much that you would do anything for them. Yeah. I definitely understand those feelings of loneliness. Kaylee has never been lonely. She's been with lots of guys. The funny thing is they just never seem to stick. Well, let me guess, terrible taste in music. No, maybe. Okay. I don't know, I just didn't really have much time to focus on relationships lately. My schoolwork's been all-consuming. School work for...? I'm in med school. Or I was. I'm on a break now. My family they've just been going through this. Her dad died. I'm sorry to hear that. I don't feel so good. Okay. I should get her home. She's got a big week. Another big performance this week. What time are you singing tomorrow night, and where? The brew house, downtown. Nine o'clock. Okay. Are you going to be there? I wouldn't miss it. I'm recording at a studio near there. So, I'll try and swing by. This is the best night of my life. Josh! Okay, let's go. Can I get a picture? Here you go. Thank you. He said he would be here. He did, but he's also very busy. Yeah. I'm sure that he just got held up. Alright, we're set here. Showtime. Ohhhhh! Hey guys. Thanks for coming out tonight. I'm Ariana Kent. Oh, wow. I'm guessing that you saw the video I posted singing on stage with Josh Halliday.

I looked everywhere for her. She's not even answering her phone. So, you said you guys have been friends for a long time? Yeah, since we were kids, I'm an only child. So, we're basically sisters. In second grade, there was this bully who made my life hell. What did he do? He steal your lunch money or something? He was a she, and she hated me. Hmm. I don't know why. It was probably because Patrick Powell had a crush on me, but Ariana was the only one who stood up for me. She locked the girl in a closet, and she gave the boy a black eye. What did Patrick do? He got caught in a crossfire. Poor kid. Ariana is the only one who just always had my back. Good friend, huh? The best. And she knows everything about you. But I wanna know more about you, Kaylee Dawson. What is your story? You just a overachieving med school dropout. Ouch! I don't know. I guess I'm just a little lost right now. I wanted to be a doctor like my dad. Can I ask what happened? Heart attack. He was 57. There I was, third year medical school, and I couldn't save him. And I felt helpless. It just happened so fast. I froze. I just don't think people should trust me with their lives. I trust you. I trust you with my whole heart. Oh yeah? Yeah. Now the question is, would you trust me to drop you home? Yeah. Good. Next question. Can I see you tomorrow? I don't know. I'm worried about Ariana. I think she's upset. She hasn't been replying to any of my texts. Okay. Well, why don't we all do something together? Something low key. Really? Yeah, why not? Ok. Speak of the devil. I think you just saved the day. Yes. Let's get out of here. Exit through the kitchen. Okay, rock star. What was that? Morning, mom. Morning, sweetie. -Can you take a picture of me? -Mmhmm. Ari wants to see what I'm wearing. We're going out today with Josh Halliday, that musician she's crazy about, and she's freaking out. Cute. Oh my god. No, no, no way. No way what? I hung out with Josh for like two seconds after Ari's show, and I'm already on the Internet. Hmm? Ooh. He's really cute. Mom! I'm sorry. You're right. I hate that those photographers think that they can do that. No, it's not that it's just, Ari really likes him. And Ari's a bit possessive. Come on. What? God forbid you ever like the same guy as Ari. Remember Brett Jeffrey's, high school, how she tried to break you guys up? We were teenagers. She just didn't want a guy to come between us. We're best friends. One of her only friends actually. Ever wonder why that is? Turn that crap off! Come on, mom. Give her a break. Her dad chose to leave. He was married to Linda, can you blame him? Shit. I'm just saying be careful, Kaylee. And if you happen to like this guy, Then maybe she doesn't even have to know. Hey! Wow, uh, you...You cut your hair. You ready? Yeah. Morning, ladies. Nice car. Wow. You two are really best friends, huh? Let me go grab my purse. Okay. Well I'm ready. Hi, Ariana. Ready? Oh...Boy. ♪ yeah ♪ Alright bro. I think we got it. You can step out. Great. Thank you. That sounded great. One more time. That sounded great. Uh, I don't know. You might wanna do it one more time, I think I heard a pop in the mic. Jerry, what do you think? No, bro. We're good. You can step out. Okay. Ariana, did you want to come in, and give it a whirl? -Seriously? -Yeah. Check. Check, one, two, one, two, three. Uh.

That was amazing. Ari, your lyrics. I had no idea you were feeling so lonely. I'm not. Singers are just like storytellers, K. I just write whatever will make the biggest impact. Oh. Well it worked. What about Josh? Did he hear? 'Cause I know you both didn't hear it last night at the bar, when you were both talking through it. Sorry, he got a call, and he had to step out. Ari's everything okay? What do you mean? Why wouldn't it be? I don't know, it's... No way. What, what is it? Madison bloom has a new song out. Oh yeah that song was, uh, leaked. She's in another room right now putting the final touches on the album as we speak. Like, now? As in right this second? Mmhm, as we speak. Oh my god. The song is called "you can have him." This better not be about... Oh goodie. It's my song. This is so not okay. Hey, calm down, Ariana. It's fine. Honestly, Madison and I are just friends. We have the same publicist, and he likes to pit us against each other in the press and sell more records, that's it. But, it's just an act. None of it's real. Actually, she's just down the hall. Do you guys wanna meet her? Sure. I'll get her. Don't give me that look. Please play nice. Anyway, it's like what you said earlier, Ari. Singers are just storytellers. No, some people need to learn when to shut their mouths. Madison, these are my new friends I was telling you about. Ariana Kent and Kaylee Dawson. Oh great. It's really nice meeting you both. You too. Yeah, we're big fans. Really? Oh Ariana, Josh tells me you're an incredible talent. When can we start talking about your album release? So, like you guys were never together? None of that's real? Um... I mean, not technically. Our friendship is real. All the songs I make are real. It's just not necessarily all about Josh here. In reality, this guy makes it into very little of my work. No offense, Josh. Yeah, none taken, maddie. I'm just glad to know that that line, what was it? He ghosted me like Casper, Wasn't actually about me. Yeah. Well, it was really nice meeting you two ladies. I gotta get back to work, so I'll see you next time. -Okay? -Thank you. All right, no problem. Oh, look guys, I hate to be the buzzkill here, but I should get home. I'm worried about my mom. I texted her and I haven't heard back. Her mom's in a wheelchair. Yeah, yeah, of course. I mean, let's get going. This is me. - Right here? - Mmhmm. Hey, thanks for a great day. Yeah, of course. Hey, I was thinking now that your fans has seen us together on stage, maybe I could be your opener. You know, when you go back on tour. Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's not actually my decision to make. Right! But you could put in a good word for me at least. Right? I gotta go, Ar. I'm sorry. Okay. Bye. Say hi to Tina for me. Okay. Oh, thank god, it's my mom. She's fine. Good. And does that still mean you have to go home? Well, I told her I’d be home for dinner, but I've got a little time. What do you want to do? -This is beautiful. -Yeah. I've been coming here since I was a kid. What's this? It's a skipping stone. Watch. First, kiss it for good luck. Then, Toss it and count. One, two, three, four. However many times it skips that's how many wishes you get to make. Your turn. You only got one. It's all I need. I had a great day. Me too. What's this? I've seen a lot of strange things in women's handbags, but a stethoscope? I grabbed the wrong bag this morning. I use this one for classes. Can I have a turn? Yeah, sure. What do you hear? Your song. What? It's got the perfect rhythm. ♪ I see the sound of the song ♪ ♪ when she looks at me ♪ ♪ she's got the perfect heart ♪ ♪ that's my Kaylee. ♪ What's wrong? Oh no, I would be a terrible doctor. No, I love the song. I really love the song, it's just... My dad, he used to call me "my Kaylee." I really wish he could meet you. Well, maybe I could meet your mom sometime soon? Yeah, okay. Thank you. Goodnight. Goodnight. Refill? I'm good. You're writing a new song? Can I see? It's just ideas, it's not finished. Well, thanks for coming over. I just wanted to talk to you about something. I already know. I can't believe this, they're... They're making it look like... You're stealing my one true love. Of course I know that you would never do that. I'm kidding. You should see your face. Okay, good. I was so nervous to talk to you about this, but I was hoping you'd understand. You know, I'd never do anything to hurt you, Ariana. It just...Happened. Listen, I would have jumped at the opportunity to spend more time with Josh too. My house just happened to be along the way, so, I got dropped off first. It wasn't quite like that. Did you guys talk about me? Did you say good things? Kaylee! Mom! What is it? There was no address. Someone must have just put it on the porch. Oh, what the hell? What? "Stay away from him or you'll end up at the bottom of that lake." Who would do this? Could be a crazy fan. I mean, just read the comment section, they hate you. But they don't even know me. How'd they know where I live? Didn't you just get here, Ariana? Surprising you didn't see anyone. You know what this reminds me of? What? Madison bloom. She's nuts, and I swear she has a song about one of her exes where she talks about a bloody fish head. Come on, Ari. You heard what Josh said. Their relationship was never even real, they're friends, and Madison couldn't have been sweeter to us. Exactly. All an act, I bet. Oh. I got to go. I'm on at brew house in a half hour. Oh, that's right. Kaylee tells me they're finally letting you play at that bar where you work. Something like that. Bye. Call the cops. -Really? -Yeah. Isn't that overreacting? No. Doesn't this sort of thing happen to famous people all the time? Dead fish heads on your doorstep? Mh-mm. I don't know why Ariana thought maybe the fish was from Madison. You think that was from Madison? Mm-mm. I don't know. It's just Ariana said... Why? Why? Because of that stupid song that she wrote? Why are you getting so worked up about this? Because someone is threatening someone that I care about. Easy. Let me see. It's not broken. You've got a nice bedside manner, doc. So, you care about me, huh? Yeah. Yeah, I do. ♪ Sometimes best friends betray you, it's sad ♪ ♪ let's all agree, they're just better off dead ♪ Thank you. Here's a new one from Madison bloom.

No. Go home. Take care of that family of yours. Yeah, if I rush now, I'll be able to catch my daughter before she falls asleep. Right. All right. Well, I'll see you. All right. Kiss that little nugget for me, okay? Will do. Alright. Hey Jerry, it's Ariana. Josh's Ariana. Oh, yeah. Hey. He told me to meet him here, we're writing a new song together. Okay. Can you do me a favor and just lock up after I leave? I'm in a rush. Yeah, sure. Of course. All right, cool. Thank you. Thanks. Um... Can I help you? Hey Madison. It's uh... It's Ariana. We met the other day, with Josh? What's this one called? "Kaylee's a goddess." Sorry about all this. Sorry you're scared. It's not your fault. And I guess I should get used to it, if I'm the girlfriend of a rock star. What? It's just... Labels... ...are tricky for me. I mean the press would have a field day, and you saw what happened with Madison. Hey. Didn't you say that I can meet your mom? You wanna meet my mom? Yeah. But you don't want me to call you my boyfriend? I like you. I really like you. And I'd really like meeting your mom. Just say yes. -Okay. -Okay. Are you hungry? Yeah. Yeah, I'm hungry. That was beautiful. Thank you. And this is delicious. Thank you. It really is. I know I promised I would introduce you to my mom, but I have no idea who this person is. It's really nice to hear you playing again mom. I've missed playing the piano. And I didn't want to say anything until I was ready, but I've been taking cooking classes two days a week. What? -That's where you've been? -Mmhmm. And I think this is pretty good. - Mom! - It's great. After the accident, Kaylee's dad did all the cooking for us. He was so good at it, I actually really loved it. And it gave me time to learn the piano, which was therapeutic. Dad was so protective of mom, especially after the accident. I think he was afraid I was going to hurt myself in the kitchen. So, what happened? If you don't mind me asking? I wish I could remember the details. Gary and the girls were playing upstairs, I was at the top of the stairs with a phone, and the next thing I knew, I woke up in the hospital unable to move my legs. She fell down the stairs. They think she had a seizure and blacked out. And it's the only time it ever happened. But now I take epilepsy meds. I'm sorry to hear that. Ari found her.

Listen Ariana, I think we need to discuss some of these things you wrote in your journal. Come on here. I should not have come here. Are you kidding me? Relax. It's okay. It's gonna be fun. You're beautiful. Hey, what's up? One sec. Kaylee? -Kaylee! -What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Oh, it's so nice to see you. It's good to see you too.

We should get to the carpet. Yeah. Let's catch up sometime. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Ariana, I'm very concerned about you. You should be concerned about you. It's so easy for anyone to get a gun these days. Just relax. Drink up. You know I can't drink with my medication. Guess it's time to get nuts, Tina. Thank you. Drink, drink, drink, drink. That's a girl. So, since you were rude enough to read my journals without asking, what did you think of my writing? Did you like my songs? I didn't love the part that said, "I hate you Kaylee." Her relationship with Josh has nothing to do with you. It has everything to do with me. We belong together. Leave my daughter alone. I thought you were her friend. Your issues are not her's. You don't get it, do you? God! You never have. You probably just gonna tell Kaylee I'm bad. Just like you were gonna tell my mom. What are you talking about? ♪ I hope everything reminds you of me ♪ ♪ my broken heart strings ♪ You look like a superstar. Almost. But if I really wanna go punk... I'm gonna need one of these. Where did you get those? I stole them from my mom. -Want one? -No way. My mom would kill me. Come on, just try it. Dirty clothes? What's going on? What is this? Do you have one? Do you have one? No Mrs. Dawson. Ariana, you should go home. Please no, Mrs. Dawson. Please can I stay? My mom's not home. Fine. But I'm gonna make sure she knows about this. Kaylee, we're gonna talk about this later. All I wanted was to belong somewhere, have a family that loved me. But you just didn't want me to have that, did you? Was it really that bad? All I'm saying is maybe we can just talk about this in the morning? No, she's bad news. After tonight that's it. I'm letting Linda know her daughter can't come here anymore. Come on, Tina, she's just a kid. She's got it rough, her mother doesn't pay attention to her. Her dad's gone. Come on. Have a heart. She's like a daughter to us. Kaylee is our daughter, Gary. Kaylee. I've always known something was off about that night. I used to have dreams about it. Marinaro's pizza, may I get your name please? Hi, it's Tina Dawson. Okay, hold just a moment. Oh, my god! You pushed me. You pushed me! You were gonna shoot me! Hold on this for me, will you? What are you doing, Ariana? Oh, well I'm gonna use you to bring Josh to me. Stop. Ariana. No Ariana. No. Ariana. Noooo! Please stop. No! Time for an encore. No! Kaylee, right here. -Oh, thank you. -I'll take your jacket. Josh! Kaylee! Josh! Kaylee! Over here! How do they know my name? They know your name before you do. Excuse me. Ariana? There's been an accident. It's your mom. Where are you? At some record release thing with Josh. What happened? I can't believe you went there without me. Ariana, you said there was an accident? You don't even care that you're there, do you? Ariana please, I'm freaking out. Hey. Your mom fell again. I found her in the basement. She's at Taylor hospital. Are you okay? What's happened? What's going on? My mom. I have to go, she fell or something. Okay. I'll get the car. Come on. What happened? Mom, I'm here. I don't know, I went by to get my music journal, and when I hit the doors open, I heard a scream and I ran in to find her, and she's at the bottom of the stairs and there's blood everywhere. It looked like she'd been drinking. What? Alcohol inhibits her medication. She was covered in red wine, there were broken bottles laying next to her. No Ari, this doesn't make sense. She wouldn't do that, that's not like her. I should've been there. I shouldn't have left her. I thought she was fine. You saw her, she was laughing. Yeah. What did the doctors say? Did they clear her c spine? Did she sustain any fractures? Any internal bleeding? Ari! Look all I know is they said it doesn't look good. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, K. Maybe you should just talk to the doctor on your own. I don't... She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be okay. I'll go get someone. Uh, Josh. Josh, I'll be waiting in the lobby. Okay. How can this be happening? At least she's breathing on her own. She's stable, that's a good sign. I'm so sorry Kay. What can I do for you? Just wanna be alone with my mom right now. Okay? Okay. I'll...be in the waiting room. No. It's fine. Just go home. I just need some time. Mom. I'm so sorry. I should have been with you. Please don't leave me. Josh! Yeah? Hey, do you think that you could give me a ride? A ride? Yeah, I rode in the ambulance with Mrs. D, I need to get home. Yeah. Yeah, okay. So, how was the party tonight? Barely made it past the front door. You look great by the way. So, you just... Found Tina on the floor? Yeah. I got there just in time. Seems like you're always getting there just in time. I know. It's like I'm Tina's guardian angel or something. Maybe it's time for Kay and Tina get a house without stairs. Mom. Oh thank god, mom. Mom, I'm here. Ari. No, mom it's me Kaylee. Ari, she...She pushed me. No. She tried to kill me. No, mom she found you. She saved your life again. Kaylee, she...She's dangerous. She was... She wants to hurt you. Mom, I'm gonna go get the doctor. Okay? -No. -I'll be right back. No, Kaylee! Kaylee. Kaylee. Kaylee, wait. I think it's really great what you're doing for Kaylee, by the way. Spending time with her to cheer up from her dad and all. But like, I also want you to be careful. Kaylee always thought it'd be kinda cool to date a celebrity. I always thought it was gross. But you know Kaylee always gets what she wants. I just want you to be careful. Come on. It is not the first time she's used her Doe eyes and heart lake to snag someone cute, or rich, or whatever. She took you to heart lake, right? Yeah. See that's her pattern. It's how she gets her claws in people. I shouldn't have told you. I'm sorry. I mean you would've found out eventually. I just feel like I'm shaken up after today and everything that's happened. I just don't wanna see anyone else get hurt. This is your house. Look, I know how much it hurts to be let down by someone that you love. I'm so sorry. I'm here if you need to talk to someone. Listen Ariana, I really appreciate your help with Kaylee's mom, but I need you to get out of my car. Why do you care so much about Kaylee? 'Cause I love her. Hey. Kaylee, Madison is dead. What? Yeah, she, uh...She overdosed. Found pills everywhere and a suicide note. Just doesn't sound like her. Oh my god. Josh, I'm so sorry. The police are here, they're questioning everyone. Won't let me leave, I'm freaking out. I'm sorry, I just wanted to hear your voice. No, I'm glad you called, I'll come over. No, I'll come to you as soon as I can, okay? Okay. Meet me at my house. Okay. Do you have any idea why Madison would do this? No, but the note was... Directed at me and you. It's already been leaked to the press. It says, "dear Josh," "I don't know why you're with that loser, Kaylee." But I don't know what to do. If I can't be with the love of my life, then I don't want to live anymore. What do I have to do to make you love me? And I am so dumb. Write it! So dumb... For writing that horrible song. I don't deserve you. And now I have to die. No. Write it. Hello? Anybody here? Didn't you just get here, Ariana. Surprising you didn't see anyone. She pushed me. She tried to kill me. If I couldn't be with the love of my life... I don't wanna live anymore. You gonna tell on me? Ariana. What are you doing here? Why do you have a knife? I trusted you like a sister. I couldn't trust Tina, but you were supposed to have my back. I still do, Ari. Just listen. You are still like a sister to me. And you are like a liar to me. You saw us together, on stage. He said I was the one. That's called fate, Kaylee. And I can't let you get in the way of that. You are just always in the way of that. Please just calm down, Ariana. You pushed me out of the way, so that you could slither in there, and make him pay attention to you. What a disappointment you've turned out to be. It's a good thing you're gonna die today too. Please Ari, don't. Don't worry. I'm gonna comfort Josh. Oh, poor little Kaylee. You don't deserve him.
