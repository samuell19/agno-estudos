♪♪♪♪♪ Okay... good. [chuckles] Come on, over here. Yeah, good boy. That's a good boy. I'm gonna have to let you go here. I gotta go inside, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am. Okay. Come here, buddy. Come here, buddy. That's it. Okay, here we go. And... up you go. Up, up, up. Good boy. There you go. I'm gonna miss you. Want some? Gonna miss you, buddy. [Zoey] Oh! -[Zoey] Man... -Hold on one second. -[under breath] Colin Richmond. -Ma'am? You okay? Oh. Hi! [Colin] Can I help you anything? Those darn curbs, hey? Um, yeah. Uh, here you go. -Thank you. [laughs] -You're welcome. -You got that? -Alright. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. You sure you're okay? Oh, yeah. Okay, make sure you don't forget his treat at 11. Okay, I'll call you soon. [Rick] Zoey, you ready? Yes, ready as I'll ever be. Okay, great. BBQ Bill's CEO Colin Richmond should be here momentarily. You met him before? I have seen him around the building and this morning it was so embarras- That's okay. Anyway, I insisted that he be here personally. Now, you should know this about him -- Colin is not a big fan of meetings. He'd rather be out with his dog. So make it short, sweet, seal the deal. Got it. [Colin] Good morning, everyone. [Rick] Morning, Colin! Please, have a coffee. Now, to kick off today's sauce strategy meeting our Ingredient Analyst Zoey McBride will be presenting first. Great to meet you. Again. Please! Have a scone. Oh. Mm. So this is smell that's been enticing me all the way from the elevator. Tastes incredible. It's lemon essence and lavender. I see. Nice combo. Yeah, Zoey's bit of a weekend chef. She always surprises us on Mondays. Now, let's see what customer feedback she has to report. Please, everyone sit down. [Zoey] All right... Welcome, everyone. The brief was a brand new sauce for BBQ Bill's. Something with universal appeal and a fresh twist. Our customer focus groups consistently tell us that a healthy and tasty menu is their top priority. Consumer feedback is showing that we are falling short on these objectives with a sauce that's high in sugar and low on natural flavors. I've analyzed every BBQ Bill's sauce ingredient and I have a lot of suggestions. And not just about the sauce. For starters, I'd take some of the unhealthy sandwich add-ons -- blue cheese, bacon... and replace them with healthy alternatives. Avocado, tasty salsas and... I have a brand new sauce suggestion that will be revolutionary for BBQ Bill's. If you'll follow me down to the test kitchens, I have a surprise for everyone. Samples of a healthy new sauce and grilled Mediterranean-style chicken sandwiches with hummus. I'm sorry. Could you just hold on one second, please? Rick, I thought this meeting was about customer feedback and planning. I thought we had our next menu and sauces all planned out. I don't think we can introduce anything new in the next three weeks. [Zoey] I think it's doable. I can definitely have the sauce available within that window and I've scoped out distribution. A co-op with local organic farms, fresh ingredients, and on-time delivery to all of your 850 stores. Okay, that is impressive, actually, but in order to make our quarterly projections, we need everything wrapped by week 49 which in restaurant speak is yesterday. Your company can be a force for change. You can be the first fast food chain to lead the category with healthy offerings. Mr. Richmond, this is a big opportunity here. Look, you've certainly done your homework, but I'm not about to change my entire product line. Look, I'm late for another meeting. Rick, we're going to talk about this later, okay? [sucks teeth] [Rick] Hold up a minute, Colin. I just got apologize for what happened in there. We will have a new plan and a new sauce, pronto. Okay, Rick, but this is your last chance. Rick, we really got a knock out of the park. Not just to satisfy our customers but our shareholders. Let's try something fun and fresh like Hawaiian. Pineapple teriyaki. We'll have it for you in a week. Two, tops. Okay, but no last-minute changes, all right? -You got it. -Okay. -Our word is as good as gold! -[Colin] All right, pal. Rick, I'm sorry. Unbelievable. I give you the agenda. I told you not to be creative but you were creative. And now my neck is on the line. You know my strength is recipes. I took a chance. He didn't even taste my healthy samples. You have no business presenting anything without my blessing. So you are out. I'm letting you go. For doing more work than you ask for? You can't fire me for that. Are you really that stubborn? You're fired. You know what? You're right. I don't belong here. I'm not like you. [exhales sharply] I put a lot of effort into this presentation. Can you believe Rick fired me? I was furious. And as soon as I walked out, I remembered my credit card bills and my rent. What am I going to do? Maybe this is a sign it's time to do something different. I mean, your true calling has always been the actual cooking not the science and research. Cooking is only a weekend hobby. I'm not that good. Not that good? Excuse me. Your food is amazing. [Shay] Seriously, your tri tip barbecue is the bomb. Actually, is there any left over in your fridge? I could come by. Oh, my gosh. What? What is going on? [Colin] Enrique! Our CEO? The reason Rick fired me? He's here. Where's here? The food truck line near the office. The guy could not care less about my presentation. Even more proof he's a bad person. He just cut the line. Ew! Ignore him. Why do you even care? Is he cute or something? No. Well, he's kind of cute, I guess. Well, you know what I always say: Rise above it. Know your worth. Thanks. I'll try. Zoey, right? Yes. Wow, imagine meeting twice in the same day. Yeah. Imagine. Actually, three times if you can count the... incident this morning. Oh, thank you for reminding me. Hey, have you tried these fish tacos ? So delicately seasoned, fresh. The sauce is to die for. Can't quite pinpoint the spices, though. Now you care about the sauce and the flavor. You know, you were a lot friendlier when I saw you earlier. When you order from Enrique, make sure to ask for the blackened halibut. He makes special off-menu for locals only. No, thank you. But I might warn Enrique there's a shark lurking about for his halibut recipe. You might want to water that little guy. Looks a little sad. You don't have to be so stubborn, you know? You could apologize. Ask for your job back. No way. My grandpa says never look back. And you said it yourself. It is time for something different. Mmm. I've loved your grandpa's barbecue sauce since high school, but the way that you make it's even better. I make it healthier. And don't tell Grandpa but I skipped the pork lard. And I've added a secret ingredient. You would never guess. Why? If you tell me you'll have to kill me? Something like that. [exhales strongly] Ooh! Hey, how about we watch an episode of American Food Truck Competition. It's your favorite. Oh, I love that show. [TV Host] Which of our local viewers will be voted Channel 5's favorite amateur food truck? The winner will take home a brand new food truck and $100,000 to start their new business. You could run a food truck with these sandwiches and make some serious bank. -Yeah, right. -Zoey, I'm serious. People would line up for this. To enter you need a team of two participants and a food truck. We'll see you there. Seriously. Zoey, do it. What have you got to lose? Where the heck would I get a food truck? I am sure I know someone who has a food truck. Well, the prize money would pay for a lot of bills. Would you enter it with me? You know, I'd love to but I'm just so busy with work right now. But how about I design a logo for you? Well, that would be great. But I do need a partner. Well, it's your grandpa's recipe. He's retired. Plenty of time on his hands. I have been telling him he needs a hobby. There you go. Okay. Well, I'll ask Grandpa tomorrow. But how am I gonna pay for a rental truck? Zoey, don't give up before you start. Okay, there's always a way. In fact, before change your mind. I'm going to help you with the application process. You know, I can see you behind there, huh? Why don't you come and talk to me? Grandpa. What are you doing? My neighbor Claudette's making noise about stealing my quince fruit, and I need to make jam. She says any fruit with the branches on her side belong to her. Yeah, poppycock, I say. She might be right, actually, but either way it's dangerous for you to be up there. Come on. [scoffs] Yeah, take her side, why don't you? -[knock at window] -[Grandpa] Ohh! She's been a thorn in my side for years. You could get to know her better. She might not be so bad. Or she could be worse. Well, she is your neighbor. So you might try to get along. Hm. She is kind of cute when she's angry. You know what they say? Catch more flies with honey. -Or jam. -Exactly. What do you got to lose? So what brings you here? Well, Grandpa, I've got a crazy little idea I want to run past you. Well, that doesn't bode well. You remember the time you convinced me to build that treehouse in the backyard for you? What was so crazy about that? Well, besides that it took me months, you know, you worked me day and night. -[laughs] -I'm a cook not a carpenter. Well, what can I say? I was a very driven five-year-old but no. So, you know how I am kind of unemployed? Kinda? Okay, definitely unemployed. I've been thinking that I want my next project to be something that I'm really passionate about. Okay. And I was wondering... Would you be willing to enter a cooking contest with me? We could win $100,000 and a food truck. Hmm. I mean, you know, it's not such a crazy idea. You're an amazing cook but, uh.. Me? I'm happily retired. Come on, Grandpa. We would make a great team. You were the line cook at the harbor clubhouse for 40 years. You know a lot about good food and I could really use your knowledge. You know, it's been a long time. Things have changed. You watch a lot of game shows, right? Yeah. Why watch one when you could be on one? Hundred thousand, huh? So you'll do it with me? -All right. -All right! All right. You're lucky, you caught me in a good mood today. Well, that is good because Shay already entered us. Hah! So what's our first step? Well, I found a place to rent a food truck and I've already got a spot leased and a temporary permit. So we can start practicing this week. Good. What's our specialty? -Grandpa's BBQ barbecue. -[laughs] A healthy version. Oh, no, why do that? You'll ruin it. I won't ruin it. Our motto is going to be great food with a healthy twist. And I will make sure it tastes great. And there's an added secret ingredient you're sure to love. Yeah? What's the secret ingredient? Here's a hint: How many jars of quince jam can you make us a.s.a.p.? Oh... Grandpa's BBQ, here we come. ♪♪♪♪♪ [knock at door] [chuckles] Where'd you find this truck again? Oh, Shay knew someone who knew someone -who gave me a good deal. -Uh huh. The truck's name is Livia apparently. Well, Livia's sounding a little rough right now. But I'm sure she'll warm up. Well, she might not be as fancy as other trucks, but she does have some charm. No question. Speaking of charm. Oh! A leprechaun! Just what we need. It's a sign. Are you saying we need luck, Grandpa? Everyone needs a little luck now and then. Well, that's easy for you to say because you have always been lucky. Eh! I like to think I earned my luck through hard work. But... I still believe in the fact that when the stars align they give you what you need, who you need, when you need it. And in our case with four wheels and a refrigeration unit. [laughs] Yes, indeed. ♪♪♪♪♪ There you go, guys. Thank you so much. Have a good one. -[Grandpa] Enjoy! -[Zoey] Bye-bye! Nice. So, customer, how you doing, sir? -[customer] Good. Yourself? -Good. Hi, how can I help you? Can I get your lunch special, your signature sandwich? Sure. -How are you today? -I can't complain. Good. You're gonna love this. -[Zoey] Here you go. -This is special. -Thank you. -[Zoey] Enjoy. Zo, we might have a problem here. [Zoey] Oh, boy. Zo, you got another customer. Oh! It's not a customer. It's you again. Uh, nice to see you, too. Zoey, isn't it? The one and only. Would you like to order something? I'd love to try your signature sandwich. Okay. Great. You moonlighting on me with an outside gig? This is my only gig. My pitch to you got me fired from my job at BBQ Bill's. Seems like you weren't a fan of my healthy food and sauce idea. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Anything I can do to help? Thanks, but no thanks. I think you've probably done enough. And, you know, I get it. It's about the business, not the food for you. I'll survive. My grandpa says everything happens for a reason. So here I am. Okay. -[grinding sound] -Come on. That didn't sound so good, huh? No, it's not. Man, oh, man, oh, man. Come on. -There you go. -[Colin] Thank you. -[Zoey] Enjoy. -I will. There are benches over there for eating. Ah. Got it. Guess I should get back to running my unhealthy barbecue empire. -Probably. -[Colin] Probably, yeah, okay. [chuckles] Wow. What's in the sauce? I'm afraid I do not share my secrets. Oh, come on. It's really good. Uh uh. Nada? Okay. HI, is everything okay? Dang! This is good. You really got something here. Thanks. It's my grandpa's recipe. But improved, fresh and healthy with a secret ingredient. Well, with sauce this good you should have way more customers. We're not really advertising. I've entered a food truck contest and we're just practicing here for a week until we find out if we got accepted. -Favorite Amateur Food Truck? -Yeah. I entered it, too, with my sister. I'm just down here helping her out doing some research on the food truck business. -In between acting gigs. -Uh huh. I'm Jesse, by the way. -Hi, I'm Zoey. -Morgan. Hi. Well, I should get going. Um, hope to see you guys in the contest. -Yeah, me too. -Take care. We're gonna win anyway. -[laughs] Good luck! -We'll see about that! Bye! That's cool. Competition. ♪♪♪♪♪ Oh, is that for me? Okay, you can just set it here. Thank you. Hm. Thank you. I didn't order anything. I don't know what that is. Thanks. ♪♪♪♪♪ [whirring sound] Hey, hey! Uh huh! [Colin] Sounds pretty good. Ah! It certainly does, thanks to you. Appreciate it. You know, honestly Livia's vintage kitchen tools work just fine, but Grandpa's happy. So, thank you. You get a lunch break anytime soon? We could try out the chicken tikka truck over there. I mean, come on. I think I owe you a lunch. -I'm busy. -No, you're not. I have food prep for tomorrow. -Really? -Mm hm. It's okay. I'll take a rain check. See ya. You'd rather chop onions than hang out with that handsome hunk, who, by the way, got us a very beautiful food processor. Grandpa, he might get your heart with a chopper or a blender, but I am not that easy. Who you callin' easy? You know, he really is quite charming. You got no reason not to take a chance. He's not my type. In fact, I'm pretty sure we're polar opposites. He got me fired because he wasn't interested in promoting healthy family food. I'm positive he has no real love for cooking. Since when is that a crime? It's just not the way that I look at food. Don't get me wrong. I think food should be exciting and creative and innovative. But people are eating BBQ Bill's every day. And that's just not healthy. Well, you certainly have a passion for it. And if there's anybody that's going to change the food industry one sandwich at a time? That would be you. Thanks, Grandpa. You always have been my biggest fan. Are you sure you getting fired was his fault? Really, Grandpa? Keep an open heart, an open mind. Maybe. [Zoey] Think you're gonna be able to get that fixed, Grandpa? [Grandpa] Yes, I do. Hey! -[Zoey] Hey! -[Grandpa] Hey, hello! Zo! How did it go, first day? It actually went great. We sold out. A lot of hungry people out there. Went so good that we wore out the food processor. Well, at least it broke doing what it loved. -But this nice, young gentleman- -[Zoey] Not a nice gentleman. The CEO who helped get me fired. This nice, young gentleman gave us a new one as a gift. -Wow. -Uh huh. Yeah. ♪♪♪♪♪ Bradley! Talk to me. Where are you at with the Hawaiian sauce? Sir, we're a small team. Bradley. We are under tremendous pressure here. We do whatever it takes. I need to come up with a sauce that is better than anything. Colin has ever tasted. And that's where you come in. Yes, sir. Whatever you say. I'm just trying to find inspiration. Bradley. Inspiration is all around you if you just look hard enough. Okay. Okay. You need to get this sauce or we are both fired. -Simple equation. Got it? -Got it. Well, get to it. We're done here. So, I stalked Colin Richmond online. Oh? Did you know he's Top 100 eligible bachelor list? Shay, you know, those lists don't mean anything. But these specials look good. Oh, way to change the subject. What are we thinking? You know what? I think he's amazing. Shay? Oh. Sorry, you were...? Can I refill your drinks, ladies? Wait, I recognize you. The food trucks? Yeah, it's Zoey. Jesse, right? Yeah. That's right. Shay.

Just holler if you need anything. Thanks, Jesse. Can I holler now? He's very cute. You can say that again. [chuckles] Okay, Grandpa. Let's just pop these things in Livia and we will be on our way.

So come on up, grab your apron. Take a moment to shout out your team slogan. [applause] Welcome to Channel 5's Favorite Amateur Food Truck Competition. I'm your host Maxine D'Alessandro. Congratulations, teams. You are the five teams that have been selected to compete on our show. First up, we have Eva's Original. We put the "oh" in original! Next we have Born to Eat. If you're born to eat, we'll be on your street! Next up, we have Grandpa's BBQ Sandwiches. We're saucy and bossy in the kitchen! Followed by Biker Bacon Love. We're bacon you crazy! -Aggressive. All right. -I like that. And last but certainly not least, we have FeasTO Dumplings. You really want something? Come see my dumpling! [competitors] Aw! [laughs] Thank you, everyone. Now who's ready to meet our celebrity judges? [cheering] Our first judge is Melissa Raven. She is an award-winning Top Chef owner of Willoughby's French Restaurant, a fine-dining favorite among Chicago foodies. And hailing all the way from New York City, we have D'Angelo Johnson, the feared-and-revered food critic from New York Fresh Magazine with his famous column "Dishin' with D'Angelo". [applause] Our third and final judge is Colin Richmond, the entrepreneur and head of BBQ Bill's, a two hundred million dollar national fast food chain. Welcome. [applause] Now each team is going to get a few minutes with the judges. They're going to interview you, get some background information, find out what really makes you tick. Pick one representative. Come on up and meet our judges. Hi. How are you? Colin's a judge. That's good, right? We'll see. Remember what I told you about keeping yourself open? -[Maxine] Okay, next group's up -[Colin] Good luck, alright? See ya. That's kinda neat, huh? You? Yeah, the one and only. Well, we only have three minutes and I've got a lot of questions. Okay. Well, I'm ready when you are, Colin. Alright. What's your favorite restaurant? Well, if we're talking about casual dining, I think I'd go for the Pizza Pan downtown. Their olive oil-brushed cauliflower, it is to die for. But if we're talking about fine dining I'd go for the aged, grass-fed steaks at Sammy's on the North Side. Ooh, or maybe the scallops at The Catch. Yeah. I don't know. It's a tough love. Those are all really good choices. I really do love the cedar plank salmon at The Catch. Hm. Good choice, yeah. You like dogs? Uh... hot dogs? No, real dogs. Yes. Great. How's that relevant? [Maxine] Okay, next group's up. ♪♪♪♪♪ [Zoey] I don't know. He's probably gonna eliminate us on the first round. [Grandpa] Be way too tough on them. -Hello. -[Grandpa] Oh, hello there! Hey, you left this on your chair there. So I thought I'd... Why didn't you tell me you were a judge? You never told me you entered the competition. But it makes sense now, I guess. The food truck business and the catchy rental truck-- -Hey, don't insult Livia. -Livia? Oh, the truck? Yeah. Livia is my truck. Now if you'll excuse me, you already ruined my chances at BBQ Bill's. I'm not going to let you ruin my chances in this contest, too. Wait a second, Zoey. I'm not trying to ruin this for you, okay? You have a real shot at winning this. Your barbecue sauce is unique. Yeah. That's exactly my point. First, you got me fired, then you started asking questions about my sauce. How am I supposed to trust you to judge on my food fairly? -Look, it's not like that. -Oh, yeah, just about the business. Right, Colin? And you know what? I saw you cut the line at Enrique's taco truck-- Look, it's not just about the judging. All the points are tallied up at the end. You should read the rules. Wait a second. I didn't cut in line. I always call ahead for my taco order. I've known Enrique for years. It's not what it looked like. Hm. Well, okay, then. In that case, thanks for the vote of confidence. It's one at least. I got to get back to work. That went well. ♪♪♪♪♪ Are you ready, teams? [cheering, applause] Good, because it is time to start our game. So, for Challenge #1, we are asking you to make and sell a unique dessert with a savory twist. You have to use at least one of your signature savory truck ingredients in a dessert item. The team with the highest sales total after three hours is the winner. Now your customers are going to be our studio employees on their break, but beware -- they have a big sweet tooth and they're pretty picky. [competitors chuckle] Now, this round has a bonus Judges' Pick. And this is for the best tasting item. The winner of this challenge gets immunity to the next one regardless of sales. [cheering, applause] Okay, at the sound of the buzzer, run to your trucks and get cookin'. Okay, okay. [buzzer] -[competitors cheering] -Show us what you got! No, no, that's so overdone. -What else you got? -Aunt May's Potato Chip Pie! Okay, I can't deny that's unique but it's not exactly healthy. Well, what dessert is? Let me do a few substitutions, make it healthier. Fine. As long as I don't taste the healthy, all right? Okay, I promise. Oh, and we'll add some whipped cream and some chocolate drizzles, huh? Non-fat yogurt topping. -Non-fat yogurt? -Yes, Grandpa! -You want to win this competition? -Get to work! [knock at door] Excuse me, sir. May I come in? Make it quick. I'm very busy. Okay. Yeah, so my roommate, his girlfriend broke up with him and he was like really sad. She's so mean. He didn't eat anything for weeks and I had no clue what to do. Then two days ago, it was like a miracle. He's okay again. Oh, good. I really hope this story is going somewhere. Yeah, but so the thing with that is that he swears it was the barbecue sauce. He got some sandwiches from this truck called Grandpa's BBQ. It's new in town. And, yeah, so... So? So... my roommate swears that this barbecue sauce cured his broken heart. I tried some of the leftovers and you know what? Even two days old, amazing! It was the best barbecue sauce I've ever tasted. Imagine what it's like when it's fresh. Okay, so we ditch the Hawaiian sauce. We reintroduce a new and improved classic barbecue sauce. Okay, go get me some. I want to taste it for inspiration. Well, there is a glitch in that plan. We can't. The truck's in the Channel 5 Amateur Food Truck Competition. And so, they're not selling anything publicly for the next two weeks. But I have an idea. [sighs] Oh, hi! How about some delicious pie? Actually, I'm more interested in your sandwiches. Do you guys have any of those for sale? Oh, not today. It's just the dessert challenge. But this is a pretty good and help your take on an old favorite. Oh! Can I get some barbecue sauce on it? Uh, no. On the side? Uh, no again. Come on. Can I just have a taste of barbecue sauce? You look really familiar. Do I know you? Yes. Yeah. I'm on the crew. You sure? I'm trying to place where I've seen you before. Look, how about I just get a little bit of barbecue sauce and I'll leave you guys alone. Wait. I know where I've seen you before. You're Bradley from the test kitchens a BBQ Bill's. Who was that? That was the guy from my old job, Bradley. He just dropped the pie and ran when I recognized him. Interesting. Why would he do that? I don't know. He asked me for a taste of my sauce. Even though I told him we were only serving pie. -Strange. -Very. Hm. Hey, you guys, what's the issue? Failed generator. And without power to the electric griddle we've only made enough bacon for five bacon-wrapped ice cream cones. I'm sorry to hear that. [sighs] Yeah. Um... maybe chop the bacon really small to make bacon sprinkles? Do an ice cream topping with black pepper and caramel. The enzymes in the pepper will bring out the top note in the caramel. Trust me. Just try it. [taps generator] That's dead. Bacon, black pepper and caramel, you said, huh? Uh huh. You're the best. -Good luck, guys. -[Biker] Thanks. Come on. We're almost out of time. Wow! Where'd they get this truck? I heard it almost exploded when they drove in. [chuckles] Let's hold higher hopes for their food. Uh huh. Time's up. So... I heard you made a pie of some sort. Yes. Aunt May's Potato Chip Pie. With chocolate drizzles and healthy yogurt topping. -Different. -Yeah. [Melissa] Let's have a taste. [exhales] Come on, Aunt May. Let's see what they think of my healthy twist on your potato chip pie. Mm. Well, I think it's delicious. -Thank you. -[Grandpa] Thanks. Thank you. Oh... No, don't say... Come on. [Maxine] All right, gather 'round, everybody. We are ready to announce the results from Challenge #1. [applause] Biker Bacon Love, your team had the lowest sales for the day due to some technical difficulties. However, you won immunity hands down from the judges for your best tasting dessert. No way! Your caramel pepper bacon ice cream topping was a total hit so you guys are still in. Congratulations! [applause] [laughs] Now the team with the highest sales for the day by far was FeasTO dumplings. [screams] We won! Your apple and sharp cheddar dumpslings were impeccable. Thank you so much. You've won this challenge. See? I told you it would work, mom. So now. The rest of the teams, you're struggling. The team that had the lowest sales for the day and will be going home is... Eve's Originals. [Maxine] Your dessert just wasn't a hit with the customers. I'm so sorry, but you ladies will be trucking on home. Thank you so much for participating. Let's give them a round of applause. Bye! Take care! Okay, remaining teams. Tomorrow is Challenge #2. We are going to be switching up your ingredients with another truck's fridge. You're going to use those ingredients to make two lunch items for our studio employees. So go home, rest up, and we'll see you back here in the morning. -[Zoey] Okay. Thanks, Maxine. -[applause] Hey, How are you, man? Hey. Yeah, you, too. [Colin] Hey. Good to see you, man.

Oh, yeah, guilty. Non-stop, actually. But you can't really compare his wet nose and his lovable eyes to just a bunch of nuts and bolts. Hey, watch out. Livia's got feelings, too. I'm serious. She seems to have a personality somehow. I'm honestly starting to love this old gal. Did you really like my Aunt May's Potato Chip Pie? Uh, yeah. That sounds more like a 'no' to me. You know, what I was about to say... It was kind of vintage. You know? Like, hipstery cool. Uh huh. [laughs] Now... is there really an Aunt May? Oh, yes, my grandpa's sister. She was a force to be reckoned with. Fiercer than spit and vinegar, but all camouflaged under a perfect Southern Charm. Well, that's where you get it from. Thanks a lot. The charm part. -[Zoey] Okay. -[Colin] [chuckles] Your ride's here. Yeah, um... Well, how about you? Do you want a lift home? Thanks. I'm okay. My grandpa's coming back to pick me up. Okay. Well... -See you around? -See you around. Okay. [sighs] ♪♪♪♪♪ All right. Let's see here. Okay. Grandpa, time's a-wastin'. Challenge has started and the lunch rush will be on us before we know it. I'm sorry, Zo. I'm just trying to... text here. Who is it, Claudette? Okay. You know, she needs my help. I'm just, you know, I'm being sneighborly. That's all. Okay, sure. But for the moment, let's get back to these ingredients because I have a couple of ideas. -Okay, I'm all ears. -Orange remoulade? Yeah, why not? And maybe... Vegetable Medley? I like it. -Okay, great. -Simple. You start chopping. ♪♪♪♪♪ That's our special today. Enjoy. I can't believe you pulled this off. I know, it actually looks appetizing. [Grandpa] And you thought Aunt May's pie was weird, huh? Let's hope you're right. Here she comes. -Hey, Grandpa's BBQ team. -Hey! Just checking in, letting you know that you have 30 minutes left to sell. And one of our judges is on their way right now for a tasting. Good luck! -Okay! -Thanks! Well, hi there, Grandpa's BBQ. So tell me about what you've made for the fridge swap challenge. Well, our special today is low-fat seasoned chicken with an orange-infused remoulade. Mm. Looks tasty. Certainly is. And let me guess -- enhanced by your famous barbecue sauce. Uh huh. you know, I've been making the same sauce for 30 years now. Zoey's changed it and it's better. [Colin] Mm! You know, we should be serving this at BBQ Bill's. Can you tell me what Zoey changed exactly? Okay, Grandpa, let's clean up. Boss has spoken. Okay. Best of luck, guys. What? [Grandpa grunts lightly] Okay, everything's clean inside and shipshape. -Thanks. -Great job on the challenge today. So I told Claudette that I'd get the cat to the vet. Oh! Claudette, huh? -Okay. All right. -Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh, stop tinkering with Livia, all right? I checked the fluids. Everything's good. We got a mechanic coming in tomorrow. Take it easy. You did great today. Okay, Grandpa, I will. Now you go have some fun. -How do I look? -You look good. -Yeah? -I think she's gonna like it. Okay, alright. -Bye, Grandpa. -Ciao. ♪♪♪♪♪ [clears throat] Need some help? No. Maybe. Do you know anything about engines? She's running hot. A little. I can take a look. Okay. Okay, let's see here. What do you think? Can you fix her? Well, you have some loose electrical wires. And, well, a rusted-out oil pan. This thing's a bit of a mess. She's not a thing. She's Livia and when you're done insulting her do you think you can fix her? I can probably do a short-term fix to get you into the competition. Yeah. -Use some of your tools? -Sure. All right, wrench, please. -Uh huh, wrench. -Thank you. Ah, pliers. Pliers. Okay. -Scalpel. -[laughs] Pressure is down, patient is critical. I'm goin' in. Livia, I'm here for you. Oh, ma'am. She might not make it. Who's the next of kin? That would be me. I'm the only one who loves her. There. Well, I think she's as good as new. Or good as old in Livia's case. Well, I'm really glad she's fixed. I love this ol' girl. Let's see how I did. Go start her up, huh? Why don't we? Okay. All right. Let's see if she works. [Zoey] Okay. [engine starts up] -[Colin] Hey! -Hey! She works. Okay, good. Oh! -Oh! Oh! -[Zoey] Oh, sorry! I got it. I got it. [Zoey] Oh, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Okay. Your girl Livia hates me. No. She doesn't, she just... she needed a little time to warm up. Are you hungry? I got lots of leftovers. That sounds great. What's on the menu? Well, let's take a look and find out. [sighs] [Zoey] Let's see. Okay, so we can have the leftover chicken from The Challenge with my barbecue sauce, which I know you've loved. And I can make us mini sliders and a salad. Sound good? Sounds great. Okay, good, because I am starving. Me too. Alright... All right. Okay, Mr. CEO. Do you still remember how to chop veggies? Wait, you think I lost my touch? Well, I don't know. We'll find out. [chuckles] Yes, we will. Okay. All right. See what we have here. Okay. [chopping] Not bad. I like watching you cook. You get in the zone like me. Don't seem so surprised. I'm not, it's just... You know, I did kind of assume you were the sort of guy who just sticks it in the microwave. [laughs] Okay, I do love to cook but I have to admit I kind of haven't done a lot lately. Well, maybe this contest can reinvigorate your passion. If Grandpa can get back into cooking, then anybody can. [Colin] Hm. So, how are things at BBQ Bill's? Yeah, you know the business is full speed ahead and... Nah, it just seems a little tougher than usual, to be honest. This contest is a nice break. So you traded the chaos of being a corporate exec for the chaos of watching Grandpa and me wrestle with potato chips and put out fires. Exactly. Very therapeutic. You know, I felt the same way at BBQ Bill's. I felt like my head was stuck in spreadsheets and stats and I never had time to do the things I loved. Hm. You seem pretty happy right now. Yeah, I am. -[phone chimes] -[Colin] Sorry. Hey, could I have a little taste of the sauce? Sure. All right. Okay, seriously, what do you put in this? Grandpa said you changed his recipe. What's the secret? You know, I have not shared my secret with anyone. In fact, I even told my best friend Shay I'd have to kill her if I did. -Oh -Yeah. Well, it's really sweet, fruity. I mean it, Colin. Stop guessing. Wait a second. Is it citrus? -No. -No, wait. Gotta be mango. Give me that spoon if you want to live. [Zoey] [chuckles] [phone chimes] Food's almost ready. You know what? This meal deserves something fancier. Why don't we take Livia for a test run? You know, and we can take her wherever and voilà, we got dinner. All right. And I can show you Tucker's favorite park. Okay, but is that even allowed? I mean, fraternizing with a judge. Isn't that against the rules? I'm okay with it if you are. [laughs] Okay. I guess I'm okay with it, too. Okay. And who's Tucker? Tucker is... my best friend. Oh. The furry kind. He is... -...an Australian. -[Zoey] Oh! Look at him! -[Colin] Five years old. -Oh, my goodness. Well, okay. It's a plan. We will dine al fresco, a gourmet leftover picnic. Perfect! [Zoey] Wow, the Andover. That is Elise Monroe. She is famous. And you know her. She's got three Michelin stars. That's right. That's right. She does. You'd really appreciate her style of presentation. -She trained in Barcelona. -Really? Yeah. I am inspired. What if I added a sea urchin foam to my sandwiches? [both laugh] Nah. I'm actually surprised that you understand Molecular Gastronomy. Of course. I mean, I do own a chain of restaurants. You consider yourself a restaurant owner? I think of your business more like running a factory. "Hey, Joe. Why don't we drop ship another batch of emulsifiers and a yellow number 5 on the unsuspecting customers?" I'm sorry. I meant... I don't know what I meant. We are a big business. No, I get it. But BBQ Bill's was a family restaurant to begin with. I worked in restaurants since I was 15 years old. Hmm. I'm proud to have expanded my dad's empire but... the industry's not like it used to be. We went public then, boom, the brand exploded overnight. -Here we are. -Hmm. Well, you've achieved a lot. And your family must be very proud. Yeah. Can I ask you a question though? Why won't you consider a healthier menu? You have such loyal customers. They would definitely keep coming back, you know? Yeah, I guess. I just never thought how we could deliver the same distinct flavors. You've seen us do it with our sauce that you like so much. And it tastes great, doesn't it? And it is 50% healthier than normal barbecue sauce. Wow. Really, that much? Yeah, when I was your ingredient analyst I did the calculations myself. Don't you think it's worth leading the way on this? Make a mark? Make a difference? Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's been in the back of my mind. But yeah, I don't know how avocados and hummus and all that kind of stuff would appeal to BBQ Bill's clientele. I think it can. And, besides, you can do it gradually. People won't even notice. And if they do they will enjoy eating the food they love and knowing they're a part of a healthier lifestyle. You got a pretty good point there. Food for thought. [both laugh] I'm sorry, by the way, I kind of assumed you were this business school brat with no restaurant experience and that really wasn't fair. Clearly, you've worked very hard. Thanks. It's just I'm not having as much fun as I used to, you know? So many balls in the air and fires to fight. But I do have a good team. It was even better with you around. Oh. [chuckles] [phone chimes] [Colin] Sorry. So, you and Rick Ferretti are still working on that revolutionary new sauce? Yeah. Yeah, he's coming up with a whole new sauce for us. Oh. You know how chipotle and sriracha are so over? Hm. Well, don't forget your old pal chimichurri. [chuckles] Yeah. [yawns] I'm tired. Yeah? We need to rest up for the next challenge. -[Colin] This is beautiful, though. -Yeah, it was nice. -[Colin] Gotta come back here. -[Zoey] [chuckles] [Colin] Well, back to see Livia. [Zoey] I can't believe I'm eating again. Colin and I literally cleaned out the refrigerator. Well, you know what this means, don't you? No. Well, you must really like him if you're comfortable enough to pig out with him. I think it means the opposite. We're just friends. We did have fun. He's not so bad, I guess, as a friend. When he was technically my boss, he didn't even seem to notice me. Until that pitch. He appreciates good food at least. Yeah, Colin surprised me. He cares a lot more than I thought. I think he just got caught up in the world of big fast food. He... he really does seem to appreciate my healthy cooking. But he has been asking me a lot of questions about my ingredients. Do you think that's weird? No, he's in the same business as you so he's probably just curious. Yeah, it's been weighing on my mind. I know they need a new revolutionary flavor. What if he is judging this competition so he can scoop out new ideas? Look, don't worry about it and don't jump to conclusions. I know. And if you are that concerned then just don't talk about your recipes in front of him. Talk about other things. Get to know him. [laughs] Okay. Well, there's no harm in that, right? Can't hurt. -You want another scoop? -Uh huh. ♪♪♪♪♪ I've just been so impressed with all of you. -Hi, guys. Good morning. -[Maxine] Good morning. -Good morning, Jesse. -Zoey, how are you? -Good. How are you doing? -Good. ♪♪♪♪♪ -Hi, Grandpa. -Hello, Zo. -How are you? -I'm good. How are you? I'm good. It's a beautiful morning today. It certainly is. All right. Another day, another challenge. Yeah, gonna be a great day. ♪♪♪♪♪ Okay. Here we go. [cheering, applause] Are you ready for Challenge #3? [competitors] Yeah! But first the results from our last challenge. Sadly, one of you will be trucking on home. Born to Eat, your team had the lowest sales total. Thank you so much for participating. And you're going to receive some fabulous kitchen supplies and gift cards from BBQ Bill's courtesy of our judge Colin Richmond. -[Grandpa] Beautiful. -[Zoey] Okay! -Good luck, guys. -[Grandpa] Thank you. We'll see you again. Take care. And now for the winner of our fridge swap challenge. With the highest sales tickets by a long stretch. Goes to... -Grandpa's BBQ. -Yes! [laughs] Okay, Grandpa. Baby, we did it. Amazing, amazing job. Now for the remaining teams the contest is about to get a lot harder. For Challenge #3 it is bang for your buck. At the sound of the buzzer you'll run to your trucks and make a lunch item using only the ingredients on your truck. That means no running to the store for food or supplies. The winner of this is the team who can sell the most items to our crew for a dollar. [buzzer] [Grandpa humming] Why so glum? I just can't believe this is the challenge. It's going to be impossible. What did you tell me before? Huh? We're not quitters. Come on. But we have nothing to use. Poppycock. There's a ton of things we can make. What? What? There's only half a head of lettuce in here. Somebody stole our food. Grandpa, nobody stole our food. Colin and I ate it all. What? All of it? We got really hungry last night after we fixed Livia. Grandpa. No, we are just friends. Yeah, I bet you are. Okay. We got to get creative here. All right. We got frozen chicken in the freezer. We ones we need buns, buns. Okay, we don't got any buns. You got any ideas? Asian chicken lettuce wraps? I think customers might buy those. Why not? Buck a piece. Well, thank you for not eating the chicken. Hey, guys? Time out. Something urgent's come up. We need all of the teams to report to the production stages right now. That does not sound good. No, it certainly doesn't. -What this is all about? -Yeah. -You okay, Grandpa? -Yeah. -All right. Hi, teams. Thank you for meeting us here on such short notice. There's been a little glitch. We receive some unfortunate information about competitor misconduct. The FeasTO Dumpling team has been disqualified. So we're giving Grandpa's BBQ and Biker Bacon Love a free pass to the next round. That was close. I did not know how we were gonna get through that challenge. McBride's luck. We're all gonna meet back here in the morning for the next challenge. In the meantime, just take the rest of the day, relax and restock. -Okay. -[Maxine] Thank you so much. Well, I'm going to take myself to the farmers market and get us restocked for tomorrow. You want me to go with you? I'll help you. No, I want you to go home get some rest and we'll come back tomorrow better and stronger. Okay. Well, at least let me help you clean up, okay? [Zoey] I really like the look of these. Are these fresh? Okay, I'll leave those then for next week. Thank you so much. -Hello. -Hello. [laughs] That smells good, doesn't it? Sorry, Tucker's usually a little better mannered than that. Well, he's just trying to be helpful, aren't you, boy? Okay, that looks a little heavy. Let me grab it from you. -Trade? - Sure. There you go. Have a little walk with me here, bud. Why do we keep running into each other? This is my favorite spot. But what's your excuse? We're just taking a little stress break. And I like this area, too. My dad opened up our first BBQ Bill's near here back in 1962. Really? Where exactly? Between Larkfield and Chelford. That's right by my place. But there are no restaurants there. Isn't that a dog shelter? That's right. When BBQ Bill's outgrew its location I decided to convert it into a non- profit Animal Rescue Foundation and found this guy there. Changed my life. That's nice. Sometimes when he's a good boy, I get a little doggie ice cream. Something tells me he's a good boy a lot. Well, you know, you shouldn't eat alone and who can say no to ice cream, right? Wouldn't be polite. True. -Hi. -Hello. Let's see. Ooh! They have my favorite. [both together] Orange cream. [both laugh] I'll get one too, please. Thank you. Doggy ice cream cone. I have to say, I've never seen this before. He's really waiting for it. That's it. Right, buddy? Here it is. That's pretty cute. Thank you. That looks really nice. Looks very nice. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. You're welcome. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Come on. Let's go. -You already have yours, bud. You are different than I thought. Yeah, I get that a lot. I was never really cut out to be businessman. I was happy to take over my dad's dream but... BBQ Bill's got too big too fast. My team hounds me saying I'm just a foodie in wolf's clothing. I try to talk the talk, but it's not really me. No, you walk the walk. I see that now. Well, this is my street. It was really nice bumping into you. Yeah, you too. Maybe someday after the competition's over I can cook for you. Tucker would really enjoy that. Right, bud? I'll see you later. See you. What do you think, buddy? She's gonna turn around. [whispers] Come on. Turn around. ♪♪♪♪♪ Guess what? She turned around. [laughs] ♪♪♪♪♪ Okay. Grandpa. I wonder what Challenge #4 is going to be all about. Who knows? We're up to it. I hope so. -Hi, guys. -Hi. Good luck to you too. Congrats, guys. You've made it to the final challenge. Next up we have... the social butterfly challenge. Your job is to get as many customers as possible to come to this studio lot to sample your signature dish. Use social media, text, call, whatever you can to get those hungry customers here. The total votes from the public are going to count in addition to the judges final tasting and verdict. You have one day to prepare, shop and cook and then just do your thing. Grandpa's BBQ, Biker Bacon Love, let's have some fun. Okay. -Good luck, everybody. -Okay. -Okay-- -Just give me a sec. I'll be right back. Maxine. Maxine, I just wanted to know if there's... Oh, hey, Grandpa. You get lost out there? You know, I think I re-aggravated my hip trying to hang Claudette's bird feeder in her garden. Oh, really? Claudette, huh? [both giggle] Look... What I wanted to say was that I'm just, you know-- What are you trying to say, Grandpa? I'm just not comfortable with this, you know, social media stuff. I just, you know... Okay. I was thinking maybe I'd, you know, beg off this round. But I'm not going to leave you high and dry. Jesse? Hi! Okay. Do we need to talk to the judges? I mean, is this even allowed? All taken care of. Okay. Well, thanks, Jesse. I really appreciate it. I can't wait to work with you. It's gonna be fun. Welcome to the Grandpa's BBQ team. You want to strategize later this afternoon? [Zoey] Sure. Yeah. [Zoey] I'll meet you at Harry's? [Jesse] My favorite place. [Zoey] All right, Jesse, cool. I'll see you then. -See you then. -[Zoey] Thanks, Jesse. All right. Okay, Grandpa. -You sure? -Yeah, it'll be great. Alright, Grandpa, well, before you bow out, help me with these buns. I'm on actor's budget. Knock yourself out, buddy. [both chuckle] So you and Zoey seem to be pretty excited to be paired together. You know each other from before? Is that against the rules or something? You're not going to disqualify, are you? I mean, yeah, we met before briefly. Like on a date or...? No, no. No. -Oh, you thought-- -You two got pretty good chemistry. No. Well, yeah, but it's not like that. Can you keep a secret? Yeah, of course. I like her friend, Shay. Oh, you like Shay. Yeah. Okay. Hey, can you keep a secret, about Zoey? Yeah. Hey, guys. What's with the weird faces? You two aren't bad-mouthing my truck Livia, are you? No, no, of course not. Okay. [both laugh] [indistinct chatter] Oh, man, I'm so nervous. Are you sure it's a good idea for me to third-wheel your meeting? You are not third-wheeling it. We need your graphic design skills for this challenge. And besides, you have been asking me about Jesse non-stop and I think he's into you too. So what better way to find out? Here he comes, now get it together. And look how happy he is to see you. I told you! -Hey, Zoey. -Hi! Hey, I remember you. You do, really? Of course. Shay, right? Right. So Jesse, what's the plan? Well, I was thinking if we combine your insanely tasty barbecue sauce and my social media accounts we can have this wrapped up in no time. Check it out. Oh, wow, 4,500 followers. Nice job, Mr. Influencer. [chuckles] Foodies and actors. There's thousands of them in the city. How do we tap into them? Well, I'm good with social media. I'll create posts and set up auto responders for sharing. Zoey, you did not tell me you were bringing an IT expert to this meeting. Shall we get started? Sure, yeah. I'll text you my account info. Actually, what's your number? You know, I've got recipes to write. Why don't I let my tech team solve the hard stuff? All right. Check you two later. -Alright. See you. -Bye. So. That's me. Okay, so we should set up a Grandpa's BBQ profile for the competition on all your accounts. Okay. Let's send a "follow us on social, like us" request to all of your followers and maybe like a call to action. I could create a discount coupon for anyone that comes to vote for us. I love it. What do you think of this? Vote... hashtag VoteGrandpa, hashtag BestBarbecue or hashtag GrandpaSaysVoteForMe. All of them. How many have you done so far? Uh... Give it here. Give it here. [knock at door] There you are. You haven't been returning my call. Where's the love? Well, I've been busy at the food truck competition. It's been a lot of work. Yeah, you look tense man. Hey, relax, can I get your cappuccino? No, I'm fine, thanks. So, how's the Hawaiian sauce coming along? We agreed it'd be ready by now, right? Yeah. That's why I was calling you. The sauce is great. You're going to love it. Great. Can I have a taste? There's just one ingredient we need to finalize. Come on, Rick. It's a simple question. Is it ready or not? You're not going to believe how good this sauce is. It's going to be a gold mine for us. Look, Rick. You said it was going to be ready by now. I put my trust in you. Okay, you got 48 hours to get the final sample ready. You got it, done. No worries. You sure you don't want that cappuccino? Another time, Rick. -Donut? -[Colin] No. [Bradley] Bradley speaking. Colin is really laying on the pressure. You need to get that sauce now. [Bradley] Yes, sir. Whatever you- Mm. Check this out. I created an emoji of Grandpa and I set it to some simple animation. [Jesse] [laughs] Genius. We can totally plaster all the accounts with this gif. I think it's called a jiff. Oh, man. Gotta get to acting class. Can we wrap this up later? Yeah. Sure. Would your boyfriend mind if I called or texted you later? Oh, no. No, he's cool. He won't mind. I'm just kidding. There's, there's no boyfriend. Awesome. I guess I'll talk to you later. Sure. Break a leg? [chuckles] Thanks. Come on over, today only! We got a specialty barbecue sandwich and truffle sweet potato fries and a drink! After you love it, go on a Nosch network and vote for Grandpa's BBQ sandwich! Come on over today only! We got a specialty barbecue sandwich with sweet potato fries and a drink! Yes, and don't forget to share with your friends. Tag Grandpa's BBQ! Hi! [Jesse] Come on over! A specialty barbecue sandwich with sweet potato fries and a drink! I know you're gonna love it! [Zoey] Oh, boy. That was really a day. -Yeah, it was. -[Zoey] We did good. Oh even better. We got 100 new followers. Oh my goodness. Hmm. -[paper rustling] -[Zoey] You outdid yourserlf. Hey, wait a sec. What's that noise? Hey! Get out of there! -[gasps] -[glass shatters] -Did you see that? -Yeah. That guy's been around my truck before asking questions about my sauce. He's from my old company. I feel like there's definitely something going on. You think so? What if my old boss sent him? I mean, I knew there were rumors but I didn't think Colin would really let him get away with stealing people's recipes. I don't know. Colin seems way above that kind of stuff. It's just probably a simple misunderstanding. You're probably right. [Zoey exhales sharply] Either way, I got your back. Thanks. [laughs] [D'Angelo] Mm. Not bad. Oh, that's all right. Mm. Spicy. Zo... I've had a blast but I think I'm heading back into retirement with my teas and my game shows. Jesse, how would you feel about sous-chefing on a more permanent basis if we win? We do work well together and it would be a crazy adventure. You'd have to be cool with me going off for auditions. Okay by me. Fine with me too. Well, if we win then let's give it a go. Okay. That sounds good. Let's do it. Grandpa's BBQ. [laughs] [Maxine] Welcome to the finale, everyone. Teams, you have been cooking all day. And right now our judges are enjoying one last taste test before voting. Do they love it? Do they hate it? We'll be tallying the results from all of the challenges because today is the final judges vote. Judges, how are you feeling right now? Zoey and Grandpa's barbecue sauce is my favorite. I mean, I wish I could have a double serving. It just pairs so perfectly with the meat. Yeah, agreed. My barbecue sauces have won a ton of awards. I shouldn't admit this but Zoey's is better. -[chuckles] -Oh, I think so too. Maybe you should ask her for the ingredients, Colin. Yeah, I'd love to be able to make it myself. Well, don't forget about Biker Bacon Love. Their wrapped pork. They haven't made it easy on us. They have not. This is true. Done. Okay, the final vote is in, folks. Who will be the winner of their very own dream truck? The winner of Channel 5's Favorite Amateur Food Truck... with a point difference of only one point -- 897 to 898. Come on, come on. The winner is... ♪♪♪♪♪ Biker Bacon Love! -[Bikers] Ohh! -[Grandpa] Oh, man... [laughing] Yeah, baby! -[applause] -[Maxine] Stu and Bob, you are the recipients of a fully -equipped, brand new food truck and $100,000. -Oh, man! -Yeah! Zoey and Grandpa Morgan, as runners-up you will receive a one-year fully paid lease to an identical food truck. Congratulations to both teams. What a contest this was! Come on and get your check, guys. Yes. Yes, great. [Zoey sighs] You okay with this? Yeah, it was such a close race and I'm happy for the bikers and we got a beautiful truck for the year. So I'm really excited to see what the future brings next. Me too. Ah, you're special, kiddo. Thanks, Grandpa. [Maxine] And from Channel 5's Favorite Amateur Food Truck I wish you all a good night and good eating. -[applause] -[Zoey] Okay, well, there you have it. [Grandpa] Congrats, guys. -[Zoey humming] Hey! -Hey! So you're alive then! Crickets. For three days. So business must be good. And your new truck looks awesome. Well, she does have a lot of bells and whistles, but I have to say I miss Livia's no-nonsense appeal. Oh, she was charming in her own way. Speaking of whistles. [whistles] As requested, some extra onions and tomatoes from the farmers market. [Zoey] Thank you. I'll get inside and get to work. What? Jesse called Colin for backup but I might have to hire someone full time if these crowds keep up. You should have seen us at lunch yesterday. I'm sorry. I'm distracted by Mr. Hotshot Executive helping you cook. He's not just poaching recipes here, right? I don't think so. Like you said that was just me jumping to conclusions. I trust him. And he really wanted to get back into his love of cooking. So what better way to do it than this? My, my, how things have come along. Food's all prepped and ready to go. -I'm off to my audition. -Okay. Thanks for being so cool with this, Zoey. Yeah, you go. Colin and I will be fine. And good luck. Thanks. No distractions, Shay. I need him back in one piece. Aw, your partner's tough. Let's get out of here before she changes her mind. -Good luck. -Thank you. [sighs] -[Zoey] Wow. -[Colin] This is really fun. [Zoey] Just look at that knife technique! You know, I've had more fun today than I've had in years. Reminds me of the, the old days. The first BBQ Bill's with my college roommate Dimitri. Forgot how good it feels to work under pressure and make hungry people happy, you know? Yeah. I really enjoyed working with you too. And you are definitely a natural. - You know what, if Jesse makes it big as an actor... -Uh huh? We could be amazing partners. And juggle all of that with being CEO of one of the biggest companies in the city? Something tells me you are not quite ready for that. We can make something work. It is a nice idea. But you already have your business and I'm just getting started, so. I know. But I could help you. Think about it. Okay, Meanwhile, hungry customers don't wait for us to daydream. -So let's get back to work. -Yes. Yes, ma'am. All right, you know I'll call the office and let him know I'll be out for the afternoon. Sure. All right, where's my phone? Oh. What is it? What's wrong? You know what? I think I can finish up on my own. Looks like you need to get back to Rick. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have looked but I guess you need to report back on whatever you found out about my sauce today. Oh, no. No, this is about our new Hawaiian sauce. Hawaiian. -Yeah. -Be honest with me. Have your people been spying on me? What? No, of course not. What--? Zoey, that goes against everything I'm about. Are you sure you weren't just pretending to love my sauce to get the details? You've been asking me a lot of questions. Not at all. Zoey, I... I like spending time with you. You've helped me bring back this spark and energy in my life that I've been missing for so long. It's nothing to do with your sauce. I wanna believe you. But I know what I saw. I caught Bradley going through my trash and Bradley works for Rick and Rick works for you. I have always thought there was something shady about him. And now I know for sure. Look, I promise. I know nothing about that. That's not how we work. This is a family business based on integrity and honesty. Hm. With someone like Rick working for you. I'm sorry, but I find that hard to believe. Aren't you supposed to know what he's up to? Zoey, you have to believe me. I'm not sure what the truth is. You should go. Zoey come on. Okay. All right. ♪♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪♪ Zoey, what is going on? Shay, I don't know what to do. I feel like I got it all wrong. You know, Rick must have been asking about something else and I just assumed it was my ingredients. And then I saw the billboard. Aloha BBQ Bill's Hawaiian. Yeah, but you weren't wrong about Rick. You knew that he couldn't be trusted. Yeah, I know but I don't care about Rick anymore. It is Colin that I feel bad about. I was so upset. I accused him of lying and I asked him to leave. And now everything is a mess. And I even lost the lucky leprechaun. I thought I left it in Livia and then I called the rental place and they couldn't find it either. Well, call Colin and tell him that you were wrong. I don't know, it feels like too little too late. Don't be so stubborn. I can't call Colin. What would I say? Zoey, guess who just got us a catering job? Great. What's wrong? Something about the new truck just doesn't feel right. I wish I could get Livia back. Look, do this catering gig tomorrow, meet up with us after you drop the food off and we'll cheer you up. [Shay] We'll cheer you up. ♪♪♪♪♪ [Zoey] Are you sure this is the right place? I feel like it looks kind of familiar. Well, this looks nice. Thank you. I'll leave you two to talk. Jesse told me this was a catering job. I'm sorry. I tricked you. I thought maybe you wouldn't come otherwise. Colin, I really-- Zoey, I just have a few things I want to say first. You were right. Rick was trying to get your sauce ingredients to replicate it. And I honestly had no idea. I know Rick is a little rough around the edge, but I didn't think stealing was his style. I honestly thought we were making Hawaiian sauce. And this whole experience, it's... it's made me realize this business is not for me. So I decided to step down as CEO at the end of month. But you love BBQ Bill's. I did. But meeting you made me realize I'm not being true to myself. And I'm so sorry for what Rick did to you. I apologize. And I let him go. Wow. -You fired Rick. -Uh huh. How did that go? Um... not so great. Not surprisingly, but... it was the right thing to do. And more importantly my last act as a CEO was to sign off on a healthier menu. Inspired by pretty much everything you recommended in your pitch. I think that's amazing. You're going to change this city. Zoey, will you... please forgive me? Of course, I forgive you. And there are a few things. I'd like to say too. I'm sorry that I doubted you. I told you that I trusted you, but I didn't. Not really. The competition was a fresh start for me when I lost my job and I jumped to conclusions about you stealing my sauce because I was afraid that I would lose everything all over again. I'm sorry. You put the fun back in everything for me. Like when we were in the truck, just making some food together, it was just... I felt so alive. It's great to have you by my side. We make great partners. And I was thinking we could... bring someone else back in the fold, hm? [laughs] Livia? -Oh! -She's all yours. Thank you. Wow. Thanks. Zoey, will you be my partner? Forever? Yes, forever. ♪♪♪♪♪ [Zoey sighs] -Good. -[both laugh] Well? Shall we? Yeah. Let's go see if she starts up. [Colin] What do you think? Looks pretty great, doesn't she? ♪♪♪♪♪ -[Colin] After you. -[Zoey] Why, thank you. ♪♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪♪
