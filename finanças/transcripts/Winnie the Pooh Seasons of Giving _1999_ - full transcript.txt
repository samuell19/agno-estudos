And the seasons gently turn like pages in a book. A time of giving shared with good friends and a silly old bear named Winnie the Pooh. Every season brings a reason to be happy Every season brings a reason to be glad When the sun is shining up above you And honey bees are in the hive What a happy reason to be glad that you're alive So every season brings a reason to be giving Giving thanks for the good things that appear When you hear that birds are singing Be it winter, fall or spring What a beautiful gift the seasons bring Gangway! I'm gonna bust every ski-jumping record there is! I'm gonna ski where no tigger has skied before. But, Tigger. How can you ski... when there's no snow? No snow? Why, of course there's... No snow? What gives here? We ought to be swimming and smothering in it. Why, today's the first day of winter. Isn't it? I don't know. My watch stopped. There. As clean as a whistle. Hey, bunny boy! Anybody home? What are you doing? We're trying to find out when winter is, long ears. And you're the only one with the calendar, Rabbit. Why... Yes. So I am. Well, let's see. As of first thing this morning, today is Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day? It's Groundhog Day! What's Groundhog Day? Everybody knows that, buddy bear. It's... Well, it's the day a groundhog comes out of his hole. Precisely. And if he sees his shadow, that means there will be six more weeks of winter. But if he doesn't, spring starts tomorrow. Exactly. Spring? What happened to winter? It's gone. Over. We missed it. Christmas too? According to the calendar, Christmas too. But the only way to be completely sure winter is over is to find the groundhog and check with him. Groundhog? Who are you calling a groundhog? I'm a gopher, not a groundhog. What are you trying to do? Insult my ancestors? Now where would we find a groundhog to see if spring's here? Oh, dear. As a very small, timid animal, I have enough trouble being a piglet. Perhaps someone else...? Nonsense. You're a perfect... ...groundhog. Do you see your shadow? Please see your shadow. I want to go skiing. Actually, I don't see a thing. No shadow? Winter's over! It's gone! - Hooray! - You're a hero for telling us spring is here. Hooray for Piglet! Come on, everyone. We have to get ready for spring. There's a lot to do. Like what? A great many things, such as airing out our houses. And spring cleaning. And most important of all, my garden. The secret to great gardening is knowing when to plant. And, thanks to you, I know that when is now. All my friends are certainly very happy with me. And I suppose they should be. After all, I did tell them winter was over. Unusual weather we're having this spring. Oh, bother. Spring? Groundhog? That piglet! You said you didn't see your shadow. You told us winter was over. Oh, dear. I did, didn't I? We prepared for spring. There should be fields full of flowers. Not six feet of snow. We're ruined. And it's all your fault. I'm sorry you have to be out in weather like this. Gesundheit. What's this? Calendar pages? Why, it's... It's only November. It's nowhere near Groundhog Day. Piglet wasrt quite as wrong as I'd thought. Oh, my. I'd better apologise to him. I've gone to find a real groundhog who can tell me when spring really is. He must be kidding. P.S. I'm not kidding. Groundhog? Calling all groundhogs. I don't remember saying that. Perhaps they just can't hear me under all the snow. Oh, dear... I think the groundhogs must have flown south for the winter. Perhaps I should try to find one later, like sometime next spring. Where could he be? There you are. You shouldn't have come out here all alone. Oh, no! You're frozen solid. I have to get you home. Quickly. He's so cold, he can't even speak. Here's some hot chocolate. He's sweating up a storm. He's... sweating away to nothing. He's melting. Get a bucket. We have to save him. You're stepping in Piglet! Poor Piglet! He's gonna faint. - How do you feel? - Well, I feel very badly for saying it was spring in the middle of winter. What? That? Don't worry about that. It was all my fault. But I was the groundhog. But my calendar... Snow, spring, winter... The pages. I never should have asked you to be a groundhog in the first place. Do you understand? - I think. - Can you ever forgive me? Of course. Did you hear that? Piglet forgives me! You're unmelted! You're all right. Yes. Thank you. Oh, no. If that's Piglet, then who is this? It kind of resembles Eeyore around the eyes. No, it's just a pile of snow. I see. Excuse me, Rabbit, but there is something I've been wondering. If it isn't spring, winter or Groundhog Day, what day is today? It's November 13th. November 13th? Do you realise what this means? Why, it's almost Thanksgiving! I'd better start making some hot chocolatey icey cream! Autumn's gentle breeze grew stronger, and a feeling of anticipation hung in the air of good things to eat, and sharing a season of thanks for all that's held dear. It's the first day of autumn! Every season brings a reason To be cheerful Every season brings a reason You should smile When the leaves start falling all around you There's the scent of autumn in the air Oh, what a happy reason To be grateful that you're there So every season there's a reason To be giving Giving thanks for the good things That we share Now it's fun to get together In the breezy autumn weather It's a wonderful gift Beyond compare Christopher Robin? Do you know which day it is? - Which? - Only my most favourite day of all. Thanksgiving Day. Is it? And what are you thankful for? Why, nothing short of everything. But most of all, I'm thankful for the company of friends, such as yourself. Which reminds me. I must remind the others. And you will be joining us for Thanksgiving dinner, won't you? I shouldn't miss it for anything. Then I really must be going as there is very much to do and very little time for doing it. Silly old bear. Hooray, hooray today is the day To give thanks for giving and give thanks away We'll gather together And share all our treats I'm sure there'll be plenty of honey to eat Hooray, hooray Today is the day To give thanks for giving and give thanks away Thanks to trees Thanks to bees Whoops, I almost forgot Thanks for the honey in my honey pot Hooray, hooray Today is the day To give thanks for giving and give thanks away Thanks for the night and thanks for this day And thanks for the honey that's coming my way Thanks for Thanksgiving It's Thanksgiving Day And so, at last, the grand day began beginning. And from all through the forest they came. One by one, all coming together, each bringing something special of his own. Acorns. A rather small plate, I'm afraid, from a rather small animal. Got the lemonade. 52.6 gallons. I work in volume. That's my secret. Fresh biscuits from a recipe passed down by my great uncle Torbitt, dashing good cook, who once made a three-minute egg in a mere 45 seconds. Thistles. Enough for everybody. Course, nobody will like 'em but me. Thanks for giving! The hot chocolatey ice cream is here! Now everything is as it should be. Or would be. We're only lacking... Just a moment. Honey, acorns, ice cream? My, my. No, this isn't right at all. This is not what Thanksgiving's about. It's not? But, Rabbit, I thought... I know, and that's why you have no business thinking. But now I'm here to do it for you. What's wrong with honey and acorns and ice cream? Why, nothing short of everything. You see, Thanksgiving is about tradition and custom. Habit and routine, defined and refined over many long years. It's about grand dinners with turkey and cranberry dressing. The once-a-year plates and pumpkin pie. Why, without these things, Thanksgiving Day is nothing, no more than a chilly Thursday. Sounds like you might be on to something there. He is? - Is he? - Even if he isn't, he is. If you hadrt have told us, we never would have known. - How can we ever thank you? - You can't. But don't worry. It just happens I've jotted some quick thoughts on this very matter. If you'd care to see. Well, if you insist. Rabbit's Helpful Guide to Celebration Organisation. Part 1 - Duties and Responsibilities. Tigger and Eeyore, you will gather cranberries for the sauce. Say no more, long ears. We'll get a whole bushel of berries or my name's not Tigger! You provide a pumpkin pie dessert. Yes, siree. I'll get right on it. I like to start work early. Keeps productivity up and your overhead down... You'll see the dinnerware is polished. I'll see to the decorations. And as for you two... To you falls the most vital duty of all. The thing everyone so looks forward to seeing on the table. - Honey? - Turkey. Excuse me, but did you say turk... Turkey. Well, yes. Of course. A turkey! What's a turkey? This is a turkey! The absolute, 100%, single-most critically crucial... crucially critical, immensely important part of the whole entire holiday! Oh, yes. That sort of turkey. Yes. Here. You'll need this. Aren't you ready? Yes, I'm not. And so Pooh and Piglet began their search. And they searched and they searched. From the top of page 23 all the way to the middle of page 47. Do you think turkeys are among the fiercest creatures? Some are. The fiercest ones tend to be rather much so, while the ones which aren't are far less. Where do you suppose we'll find them? I think they might be any number of places. They often lurk about in bushes such as these. They do? But it's the ones in trees you really have to be careful of. Oh, dear! They say the swimming ones are by far the most dangerous. Oh, dear! A turkey will be lurking in the trees, ready to attack us with a jump. With bony arms and legs and teeth and knees. Enormous eyes and one big hump. Oh, dear. I think that turkey might be dangerous. Oh, we don't even know if he has got one. But he'll still be very awfully strange to us. We'll never know until we've caught one. So clean, it squeaks. It reminds me of the time Aunt Ophelia joined the Royal Opera. Buy in bulk. That's my motto. The poor dear, alas, quite laid an egg. And her debut proved a swansong. There's gotta be some efficient way to process these pumpkins. While the critics dismissed her performance as a bomb, Ophelia herself had a blast. - Blast! Very good! - By diggity! That's it! I'll blast! So clean, one could very nearly eat off it. Another half of jalapeno, and a tad more turmeric. Yes, siree. That's what I like. A dessert with attitude. A magnificent bone china, left to me by my great grandfather. Once I crank her up to 2,000 centigrade, this baby'll be done in no time. I have had a thought, or so I think. And what I have thought is this. If we cannot find a turkey, perhaps the turkey shall have to find us. That is precisely what I'm afraid of. What I mean to say is that one cannot trap a turkey without first having a trap. And so, as Pooh and Piglet set about solving their problem, a few pages over, Tigger and Eeyore were having troubles of their own. Berries, berries and more... These berries aren't fresh enough for us. They're blueish. Could be cos they're blueberries. Come on, donkey boy. Only the best berries is good enough for us. Berrily, we roll along Please don't pick the cherries Sing a berry pickin song Love them pretty berries Leave them berries where they are Those'll never do Tiggers love them red by far those are much too blue We won't let 'em get away we'll track 'em in the woods March 'em home, whaddya say? Berries is better than good Berrily we roll along Please don't pick the cherries Sing the berry-pickin song Love them cranny-berries How will we know we've built a proper turkey trap? I rather doubt we will until we've trapped a proper turkey. - Pooh Bear? - Yes, Piglet? How shall we get out? Bother... We're gonna make old long ears proud. Just wait till he feasts his eyes on this feast. We're gonna make this the best Thanksgiving ever. The rip-roaringest, shindiginest celebration of them all. Hip-hip-hooray... Look at the time. We've gotta get going or Thanksgiving's gonna be gone. Last one there's a rotten elk! And now, Piglet, we need only find bait for baiting the trap. Would you know what turkeys like? I'm not certain. Perhaps they're fond of honey. What else do you think they like? Wait till bunny boy sees all the... berries? We was robbed! What are we gonna do? Everyone's counting on us to get the berries. Without 'em, Thanksgiving's just like any other old day. - What are we gonna do? - Guess we start starting over. What incredible luck. Somebody's dropped a whole trail of berries. Come on, donkey boy. What was that? That was my stomach. It must be near time for dinner. Yes, I've gone a bit rumbly in the tumbly. Was that your stomach? I don't think so. Oh, yes! An amazing accomplishment. Absolutely astonishing. Altogether astounding, if I do say so myself. This will surely be the happiest of Thanksgivings. Only five minutes till noon. What has become of them? Coming through. Make room. Watch your backs. I say, might someone lend a hand here? You've done it. Now we can have a proper Thanksgiving. My, it is a big turkey, isn't it? And rather loud. And somewhat fierce. Still, I suppose we should open it. Go ahead. No can do. Not in my job specification. You do it. Perhaps we should wait for Tigger and Eeyore to arrive. It's only polite, you know. It really would not be Thanksgiving without them. - Oh, my. The pie! - I say! My word! Spectacular! Every last little thing. Gone. Wrecked. Ruined. Our Thanksgiving is no more. - But... - See for yourself. There is nothing to be thanful for. It's gonna be a Thank-less-giving. - But we still have... - No. We do not. Better luck next year. Some Thanksgiving. Reminds me pretty much of any day. Oh, dear. I'm afraid this really has become no more than a chilly Thursday. Happy Thanksgiving... Being all alone and lonesome is not something that tiggers like best. After all I did for them, working a holiday. I should have charged them time-and-a-half overtime. More tea, Owl? Yes. Thank you. Don't mind if I do. It's a rather sad thing, indeed. But this day has become quite like any other. I suppose this is all the thanksgiving I shall have. If only I might share what little I do have. I suppose I could. Couldrt I? Although I'm only a bear of very little brain, I can think of no reason not. Hello! What are you talking about? It's Thanksgiving. But the decorations, the food... - The party. - It's all right here, long ears. Everything except you. Who made that thistle soup? I shall try the honey. I should like to propose this Thanksgiving celebration be held in honour of our good friend Rabbit for the planning and hard work he put into it. - Hear, hear! - Three cheers for bunny boy! Hip-hip-hooray! What a splendid evening. What a lovely feast There's food enough to calm the most ferocious of beasts I wonder why we worried And scurried all around Looking for the very thing that we've already found Friends, near and far away Sharing all today Gathering to say we're thankful Friends, friends in every way Make each and every day Our Thanksgiving Day There's so much more than more here It's altogether true And being all together is the best thing to do Friends, near and far away Sharing all today Gathering to say we're thankful Friends, friends in every way Make each and every day our Thanksgiving Day Make each and every day Our Thanksgiving Day It was a most thankful day for Winnie the Pooh and friends. For of all the things they had or ever might, the grandest one of all was the gift of friendship. Every season brings a reason To be joyful Every season brings a sun your eye can see When the winter wind begins a-blowing You'll soon be playing in the snow And it won't be long till Christmas Comes to set your heart aglow So every season brings a reason To be giving Giving thanks for the seasons of good cheer But most of all, we're grateful For the loved ones we hold dear Every glorious season of the year Every glorious season Of the year This is the tastiest Christmas ever. But I think perhaps you should have made more popcorn. - Oh, dear. - Now just hold still. - I've almost got it. - Couldrt move if I wanted to. Not that I mind, really. Just thought I'd mention it. But what if Santa gets stuck in the chimney, Mama? I'm sure he knows all about chimneys, dear. What if he doesn't like the cookies I left for him? He's going to love your cookies. But what if Santa... Special delivery for a Mr Rabbit. Hold on a second. It was in here somewhere. Hey, I thought I remembered it. Here it is. It's from a Miss Kay, Cat... Cassie? Let me see that. Oh, my goodness gracious. It's from Cassie. - Who's Cassie? - Who is Cassie? She's only the smartest, sweetest, most wonderful little bird in the whole wide world. Rabbit once rescued her. Really? How did you rescue her? Well... It was a very windy day and the snow was blowing so hard you could barely see the ground... Scarf? Check... - Ear muffs? - Checkerooni. Hot water bottle? - The hot water bottle. - I believe it's in Rabbit's house. Do I have to do everything myself? There's a life that needs to be saved. There, there. Rabbit will take care of you. Help! Did you say something? Oh, dear! No! Poor little bird. I gotta get a ladder! Forgive me. I gotta go! Help! Nice catch, bunny boy. What do you know - out of gas. Are you all right, Rabbit? No, and I don't plan on being all right for a very long time to come. Cassie all right. You saved her. Why, you're a hero. Look at my house. - It's a mess. - Cassie's sorry. There, there. It's not your fault. Then I don't know whose fault it is. Well, now that we've got you, what are we supposed to do with you? Why, Piglet and Tigger and I shall take care of her. You? You can't even take care of a carrot. I'll take care of her myself. You don't believe I can do it all alone? Well, I don't need anyone. There's probably no one in 100 Acre Wood who knows more about baby birds than me. Why, she's going to be no trouble at all. I up so high. No trouble at all. Rock-a-bye and keep still You're driving me crazy There. I'm glad one of us is enjoying this. Daddy's sad? Daddy? No, I'm Rabbit. Back, you monster! Good morning, Rabbit. I see you're having breahfast. May we join you? Join me? I don't care what happens to her. I have a carrot patch to plant. There, there. Quiet down. Well, what are you looking at? Havert you ever seen a baby cry? Here, just give her a bath. That'll keep her and you out of trouble. Why is Rabbit always so grumpy around Cassie? Well, perhaps he's just not as fond of her as we are. Could you possibly find me a small bird-sized towel? Oh, bother. Here's the towel. Perfect. Why, I'll plant my carrots so early this year they'll be ripe by spring time. What's that? See me? Oh, my. She'll float away! She'll never come down! I got you! Did you see me? Now promise me you won't go so high ever again. It's not safe. But I like it. But I like you and I don't want anything to happen to you. I promise. Am I doing this right? Not bad, but you have to choke up on your grip. And what is this? Well, it's mine. What? When you taught me how to plant carrots, that was my very first one. I was going to save it special. For you. Well, you should have told me. Look. I stubbed my toe. I'm sorry. That's all right. Now why don't you just run along and... Hiya, bunny boy. Just dropped by to see if the kiddo can come and play. Please? No, she can't. I was just teaching her something useful. How to weed carrots. Is he lucky? Weeding carrots is what tiggers do best. Stop! What's the matter? Am I making you look bad in front of the kid? You're pulling out my carrots! So these are carrots? What do you know? What do you say? Does Uncle Tigger know how to bounce or what? I bet you're the best bouncer in the whole world. That was nothing. Now I'm going to clear that tree. It's almost like we were flying. And now that one. Actually, I'll embarrass the tree if I jump it all at once, so I'll take it in three bounces. That was fun. There. That wasrt so bad. Help! I can't... I can't move. I'm slipping. Help me. Hold on! I'll save you! What to do? Swing your tail and toss Cassie up to me. One for the money, two for the show. Three to get out of here and here you go. Hold on tight. And I'll pull you up. I've got to get her back. Wait a minute, bunny boy. She's gone. Why, a vertical half-gainer. How unusual. You know, I recall I had an uncle Horatio who used to dive in just that manner. Excuse me, Mr Owl. Yes, now, where was I? Oh, right. Uncle Horatio. I never even told her I loved her. And then after Horatio took third place at Rome, he went off to Acapulco, or was it Topeka? Never mind. Did you see us? We were flying. You're all right. More than all right. She was absolutely made for flying. And Owl's gonna teach me. It shall be my pleasure, my dear. A little practice, and you'll be able to fly south for the winter. Fly south? Never. You keep your big feathers out of this. If she were meant to fly south, she'd have wings. So there. But Rabbit... I do have wings. Flying will lead to no good. Remember the promise you made me about not going too high? Well, yes, but... Good. Then no more talk about flying. We're going to have lots more fun than flying. And the little princess bird was thrown into a deep dungeon, with only her faithful friend Rabbit to protect her. But then, when things looked blackest, and... Please don't tell Rabbit I'm learning to fly. It'd make him so sad. It looks to me as if you're learning to fall. I'm not very good. Oh, no. Very good... for going down. What you need is a way for going up. Now, as soon as you're up, raise the landing gear. Your legs. Like this? Yes. Now, are you ready for take-off? No, she's not. Because she's not flying. Hello, Rabbit. Don't hello me. You're deliberately teaching her to fly and against my wishes. But you only said for Owl not to teach her how to... When I say owls, I mean bears too. And you. How could you? You promised. But, Rabbit, I just have to fly. It means everything to me. Does it mean more than I do? Hey, bunny boy. Why don't you give the kid a chance? You stay out of this, and just let go of that. - But... - Right now. Why didn't I stay in my garden with my nice, safe carrots? Have I hit yet? No, Rabbit. Cassie saved you. But how? I flew! You what? Aren't you proud of me? Now I can fly south. That's right! You soloed! Oh, boy. There's nothing holding you down now. Don't you think I know? Could you read me one last bedtime story? You mean, before you leave? No, I didn't mean that. I meant... You don't need me to read you a bedtime story. You don't need me for anything. And then when you feel the drag ratio overcome your lateral velocity, "voila!" Flight! Get ready for take-off before you're snowed in for the whole winter. But where's Rabbit? I can't leave without saying goodbye to him. I'm sure he was just busy with his garden. His garden. Where is it? It seems the time is right and the time is now. And I'd just like to say... Hey, Casserino? Before you go, how about a little S-O-T-T? Smooch on the Tigger. That's what tiggers love best. There it is. For me? Be careful. You know, that's a very strong wind. I know Rabbit's real busy, but could you remember to tell him I'll never forget him? I'll remember to... to tell... What was it? Now, my dear, it's time to soar. Wait for me. I'm coming, Cassie. Do give my regards to everyone down south. Wait! Don't go! I changed my mind. You can fly. Just don't go away. Did you think I would leave without saying goodbye to you? I hope spring decides to come early this year. I can't wait to see Cassie again. It's the most peculiar thing. For the longest time, I thought Rabbit didn't like her. You know, sometimes people care too much. I think it's called love. Do you think we should tell Rabbit? Don't worry. I believe he already knows. And that was the last time I saw her. Nicest story I ever heard. You said it, buddy boy. Oh, my goodness. Look at the time. We have to finish the tree. Come on, everybody. Now, be careful. Don't break anything. Oh, dear. It's so short. Next year, we should try to make it a little longer. Do you like to eat acorns? No, I'm not too fond of acorns. Good. Then next year, we shall string acorns. Higher! You got it, buddy boy. Can you see it, Mama? Mine's the highest one. It certainly is, dear. - Why, it's a lovely tree. - A fine specimen indeed. Now that is what I call a splendiferous tree! There. That should do it. Oh, dear. Oh, no. Mercy me, what have I done? What exactly have you done, Rabbit? I've forgotten the most important thing. Don't you see? The star. Why, every Christmas tree needs a star on top. I was just so busy I forgot all about it and now Christmas just won't be right. It doesn't matter. It's a beautiful tree. We'll have a fine Christmas. I've got an empty honey pot at home that would make a fine top for any tree. Thank you, but it just wouldn't be the same. Look, Mama. A falling star. Hurry, everyone. Make a wish. I think that falling star is falling this way. Goodness gracious. Why, that's no falling star. That's... Merry Christmas. I'd say Rabbit's wish came true. Merry Christmas, everyone. And so, another Christmas came and went in the 100 Acre Wood. It had been a joyous season of giving for all our friends, but especially for a little bear named Winnie the Pooh.
