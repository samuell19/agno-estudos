I had lunch with Chen Yin Shing this afternoon. I've got reliable news that. They're going to buy United Corporation next week. So its time to buy some of its shares. It's good this...let's buy some at its low price. James. what a chance! Are you alright? Even money can't excite you! We're investigating into Lee You're the inspector of COB I know. but I've only treated it as my part-time job. My main job is any profit-making speculations Provided its legal. No one is as professional as you. Our investigation is unofficial We may not be rewarded Even if we help our senior to beat the tiger. But if we tail, we'd be responsible So, I've to think for myself. But how can we let Lee cheat all the money from HK people? Do you know that in the business world. Many have secret undertaking with the high rank officers. They are all thieves. It's reality. So your main job is a thief. And part time job is a cop, isn't it? I know my position is very embarrassing. I always have to adjust myself! May I be excused? Where are you going? Washroom. Hey, James! You hit me, you hit me! I'll leave! I'll open a property investment company next month. My large! is the properties of USA and Canada. Wong's company can't reach the places beyond HK. Why don't you come and help me? Thank you, Mr. Lee.

Stealing money after stealing heart! Don't pull off a stunt! Tell frankly. This is an eavesdropper. We're investigating Lee. John knew that you'd an appointment with Lee, so... He put it in your hand bag. It's so exciting! Maybe. let me help you to investigate! I suspect that there is something wrong with my boss! Stay away from this! It's dangerous! Has your boss ever taken your advantage? Why don't you resign? He is like a wolf indeed! He's got drunken only. He must be... I don't want you to be harassed sorry Let's get married. Would you marry me? The night scenery here is really fascinating! Sorry, I was greedy. I will give you back 20 million! Mr. Lee will give you what he promised. Even when you're dead. Don't kill me!

We can charge Lee now. Well done, James. Thank you sir! But we've to proceed as quickly as we can. I don'! want to be stopped by my heads. May be your girlfriend Suki can help to get some information about Mr. Wong. Objection sir. This morning, Suki has promised John to help over the phone. Sir, I disagree to your plan. I'm not so close with her. So whatever you done at her house last night? Next lime. do remember to throw away the bug first! Is it clear. James? Yes sir! What a superman he was! Last night he courted her... Really? Are you bluffing? What's wrong? You bastard! What's the matter? Release me! Are you crazy? What're you doing? James. slop it! It's private between Suki and me If Suki gets any harm, I won't let you go. Are you sure that she is innocent? How much do you know about her? You trust her so much! Is it your 1st time to fall in love? Yes, I do! James, its my idea to ask for her help. John is right. You're Suki's boyfriend. But you are also a COB Inspector. Chan was struck dead by a car last night. And his office was on fire this morning. They've begun to destroy evidence. We've to take action ahead of Lee James. you two go and arrest William Wong at once. I'd like to ï¬‚ee with you anyway. You know I love you. What's the relationship between you and Lee? Why are you so scared of him? I can tell you want to follow him. What are you talking about? Don't forget. without me. you could never be what you are! No, I fight it be my own self. And I've earned much for the company these years. What's the matter? Mr. Wong. a few cops want to see you. Wait for me! US $10 million! You're suspected to have committed commercial crimes. Let's go inside! Let's go. What are you doing? Release! Sorry...We're cops, just a routine check Hands off me. Take away all the documents. Who are you? I'm his staff. Please go outside. Do you have a warrant? Don't search my documents. or I'll sue you... Mr. Wong is taken away by cops, hold it... Miss Cheung, he calls for Mr. Wong. I told him that Mr. Wong has been taken by the cops. Then he wants to talk to you. Hello... Suki, Lee's speaking. Your boss is arrested. So I guess you'd find a new job now. Did the police take any documents with them? I don't know what documents you're talking about. Did they or didn't they? I don't know. Call the ambulance! How is James? Hasn't my senior Alex told you? No! He left in a great hurry. He just said that something happens to James. How is he? He's a hero. He shot the killer. Because the killer murdered Wong. The Situation thus becomes complicated. So we've called our senior to handle it. What? Shit! The price slides so much? Is it because Cheng has leaked out deceptive information to buy stock? You check it for me. U.C. has been suspected to make forged ledgers. Is it truth? You work in COB Even you don't know. How can I know? Hello...slides so much? Make the balance... It costs a million? I won't quit... I will lose millions... Wait and see... Make up the balance for me! John, Wong extorts Lee for 10 million US dollars. Oh, the things in this box are so valuable. Stephen, you take Suki home first. I'll ask James to take your place soon. Remember, take good care of her. OK, we go first. OK. Sir Dewey, thank you very much. It's really a great relief! Keep in touch! Bye-bye! Investigate me? Many people will be in trouble! Boss. I received a fax. I'm blackmailed for US $10 million and should pay within 2 hours. They've really got the document! No other choice then.

Wail for me, I'll be right there. Yes sir! I am worry about you. I'm fine. Are you scared? I'm scared when I know Wong is dead. We've never dreamt that Lee is so cruel. I've heard that John lost a lot in his stocks. He got the tips from Lee. So he invested all his money. Lee always earns money on risky business I think John must go bankrupt this time. Sir... I won't bother you anymore. go on chatting. I'll leave now. see you. Help...Help... Help! Help! Leave me alone. James, Help me! James! Save me. Help! Hands off me! You really like to scream?

Sorry. we've made a mistake. Don't hurt the lady! James! I won't hurt her but I'll hurt you! Still tailing? inform the boss right away. So disgusting! Disturbing us. Oh no! Mr. Lee, please don't. OK!

Officer Chan, I'm Lee Siu Pong. Yes, Thank you! Don't worry. I'll do it nice and tidy. Roy, bring all the documents back to me. After washing your face, you look beautiful Is what happened tonight exciting? I'll forget anything happened tonight. Another smart-person in HK. Liar! I've got to punish you. Have you checked clearly? Yes. This is questionable. Why didn't Stephen show up? I've paged him, but he hasn't returned call yet. There is something wrong with these accounts. Stop! Collect all the documents for me. Don't leave a single piece of paper. Yes! Let me swim across Chang Jiang at sixty. Like our Chairman Mao. I'll advise you not to swim. I don't want to take care of you if you catch a cold. Haven't you told me that you are a great doctor? You said that you can save a person from death. Certainly. If I've got the license. All the doctors in HK have to close down their clinics. Exaggeration. â€œThe East is red, the sun is rising..." What's it? While Head, help! Is he OK? Slowly! Lay him down slowly He has been deeply burnt. It's hard to save his life He can't be saved if he's sent to Q.E. Hospital You are a poor doctor, you know? He has to lead a bitter life. Even if he's saved by you. By the way. Do you think he comes from mainland? Suki... What did he say? Suki. Definitely his lover! Hopeless! Just like your wife. what a pity! No more nonsense! Call Little Q Ask him to smuggle the medicines for me. Hurry up! OK! I'll go! Don't get mad! Sure, Sir Dewey, thank you very much. Bye! Billy had checked that all the documents are here! I've just talked with Superintendent Chan and Sir Dewey that the case has been covered up. No one would look into it again. Those two cops must have extorted me. We'd better keep silent first. Should we do something to that woman...? She enjoyed making love with me last night. Fantastic! I think she wishes to a here to me. So I've to make use of her to earn big money for me. You haven't passed away Willing to wake up at last? I've waited for you for a whole week. I'm Chan Tak Shum. I'm in Charge of this case. You're accused of abusing power and unauthorized arrest. What has caused the death of 3 colleagues. Has my senior Alex told? Alex has told me that he didn't know you extort Mr. Lee. With the forged documents Besides. your investment consultant is wailing for you outside. He'd like you to settle the 4 million debt with you. I'm sure you can settle it. Guy, you know what you've done. We don't want to stir up the case. That's why you're just dismissed. You're lucky. Don't be big mouth when you are out! OK, that's it. Bye. Bye... Do you think he is crazy? Just imagine you are the one who's burnt like him. I'm afraid the house will be pulled down if you let him stay. Damn. He's been here for six months. Don't you think he is a detective of COB? He can't cheat me! I'm so smart! So why doesn't he report to the police? He doesn't want people to see his face. It's not wise to hide away! Anyway, you don't have to feel abased. You cannot hide away for the rest of you life. It's still your real face. It's better than those who always wear a mask. And try hard to climb up the social ladder. Hey, where are you going? Come back ID please. What a ugly creature! Guess how did he get hurt? I think he's been burnt. I don't think so. I think he's been beaten by his wife. No. I think he was injured by hot soup. Is that so? Are you alright? You almost get me into trouble. Are you OK? I'm OK. Come on... Hello, Mr. Lee Hello, Mr. Ho Congratulations. Thanks for your coming. You're welcome. Mrs. Ho. Congratulations. Let us drink! OK. They're all over there! Hey, Mr. Ho has home. How are you, Mr. Ho? How are you What a nice party! Hello, Sir Powell, thanks for your coming. Mr. Lee, congratulations... Thanks! The Commissioner of Finance is coming. Mr. Lee. its your honor to have the Commissioner to come. It's not my honor. Actually, I've express my gratitude to my assistant Suki Cheung In future, this company will be managed by her. And we still need your assistance. You're welcome! Thank you! Congratulations. Thanks! Suki nice to meet you! Congratulations. Thank. Excuse me. Thank. Welcome. Congratulations for your new venture. Mr. Lee! Thanks. Congratulations. Just a tiny business. You wouldn't care to do business with me. There will be a chance. Let's go inside and talk. What's the matter? What's wrong with them? They've quarreled. Over the buying of Hang Fung Corp, last time. Oh. its serious. I understand now. Noble Liu, what do you think about the plan that we've discussed last lime? You've got so many plans. Ours has to be postponed. It's not a problem! Is she your assistant Suki? Yes! She's green. She'll help me to manage this company. She's a smart girl! She's not only smart. My staff told me that she's also got very good judgment and foresight. She'll be the super star in this field. It's just because she's young. It's more energetic to be young. Why are you so scared? What have you done? Why did you hide in my car? What do you want? GM Cheung, I can't get in touch with you. Even though I went to your office. But you can't hide away from him. That's the things James left over. It's understandable that you cry for him. You couldn't reach your present position if you hadn't betrayed him. Not only have you betrayed him. You've also tricked us. You are silly enough to believe in the tips. You lost money just because of your greed. Then you make use of Mr. Wong's documents to extort Lee. Yes, I was greedy. But you should know why. No one knows better than you. Don't play tricks any more! Who plays tricks? I like to trick you! Trick you whenever I can. Actually. we've discussed about this plan several times. But although he's very interested in it. He postpones signing the contract again and again. It seems that he's suspicious of something. he know's that there's something wrong with your holding companies? I'm worrying about that. But I think he doesn't know the real truth. If he had known it. He definitely would have taken my piece of land. Maybe we'd better give up this risky project. Give up? But don't you know that if we succeed. We'll make a good fortune. Everything is risky in this world. And I have found a middle man this time. Me? I'm your staff. will he trust me? If you become his woman. You can be the middle man. Nonsense! Lead a good life or a bad one. It's up to you. Welcome, thanks for your coming... Sir, Noble Liu and our boss haven't come yet... Pay attention! What a dull job it is! Tonight very lively! Yes! Noble Liu, you look so good! So are you! This way. Please come in. Thank you! How are you, Sir Liu? I'm fine. Thanks! Make yourself at home. The Party is good! Thank you! Excuse me. Actually, I know your plan very well. What's it? Lee wants to trap me with a pretty woman. I won't be trapped. But, I love the pretty woman still. Especially those smart and pretty ones. If you pretend to be trapped. I can guarantee. within a week. You can earn at least 50 billion. You are really smart girl. Tell me step by step. What do you think? I'm getting more and more interested. How can you think of such a good idea! If you come to help me after this. I'll guarantee you $10 million annual salary. Any other request? Sure. more requirement. more'd be paid. James! Chase him, hurry up! Chase him! Stop! Stop! What's happened? I'm not sure. Why don't you chase after them? It's more important to guard here. Get out! Get in, hurry up. James. sorry! You bastard! Put all the blame on me. I wouldn't admit it. And you defamed me. How can you say that you've never asked us to follow Lee? If you hadn't extorted Lee. The case would not have come out like this. I've never extorted him. If I had 10 million, I didn't have to sell my house and my car and owe other big debts. In fact, I'm suspecting of you and Suki. How can you suspect of Suki. If you hadn't got her involved. She wouldn't become the puppet of Lee. She's the puppet? I think we were her puppet. She trapped us into the game. And with Lee's support. She gets rich and powerful in the business world. She's got everything, we are the losers. You shouldn't condemn her! Are you really so foolish. man! You are burnt like this... and she would pretend not knowing you! You shut up! You always live in dreams. I won't be as foolish as you. I'll surely unveil Suki's misdeeds. Calm down! Leave her alone! John, don't be silly! You can't afford it. Don't worry, you'll definitely get your pension. Tiger hero! While Head... Hold it! Start the boat! Hurry up! James...James... James! I'm not James You are! You're James! You're James. No. I'm not James. You are! I'm not! You are! You are James! James! I'm happy to see you again. No matter how you look. I wouldn't mind. We would surely defeat Lee one day. Then I would find the best doctor to reconstruct your face. So as to restore your look. While head, if you hear me. Pray that I take revenge for you! Mr. Lee Are you scared of me? You've forgotten something! Take it back. Noble Liu called me this morning consented to our proposal So quick? You see I've never made a wrong judgment. You always get a clue. I think, it might not because of me. Mightn't it because he knows your real intention? It's impossible! Unless... The Commissioner of Finance joins hands with him. But they aren't of the same type. And you've such a good relationship with the Commissioner. So I believe its alright so far. If I get into trouble. you can't be exempted. We're in the same boat. Even the pistol that killed the cop. There's you fingerprint on it. Isn't it? In the last few nights. I didn't sleep well. I feel very anxious! I'm not used to be without you. So I want to find someone to replace you. For this. Maybe you can help. Mr. Lee gives you this $200,000 cheque. People say that every successful man. Should get a supportive woman behind. But I'd rather say that. A successful woman has to have her own men to support her. Keep this to you. I've never said this to anybody. I'll keep it in my mind. You can go now. OK I go first. It has been a long time for I've waited for a woman for so long. It's worthwhile this time. Its still to be seen They're my assistants. I think all of you have known this lady Miss Cheung. An important figure in Lee's group. Are you still afraid of me? Aren't you? Are you satisfied with the way of we share the pie? Sure! If not with the assistance of you Commissioner of Finance. How can we ever succeed? So, its fair to devide it by three. OK, I'd like to have the contract signed tomorrow afternoon. So soon! Would Lee suspect it? I think he can't wail to go bankrupt. Cheers. That woman. I think we can't trust her. She always stops us from taking revenge. A wicked woman is more dangerous than a wicked man. You'd better watch out! Hello, Suki. Oh, its her! I know! Sure she is telling us to be patient! I can't stand it no more. We'll take action tonight. So soon? I'm not well prepared! Why doesn't she inform us earlier? What's the matter? It's so late! Come out! He's still pretending! Keep me waiting for over an hour. That dumb-bell! Yes. Everything is going smoothly I'll go to the solicitor's office tomorrow morning. To check the details. So we can sign the contract in afternoon. I totally agree. It's real good news. So I come to inform you. You're getting smarter. If there is nothing else, go home first. I won't disturb you! I'll leave. It seems that someone was following me when I came. Let me drive you home. OK! Bye. Bye. The road is blocked. Go to take a look. I've got it. See you, James. What? Have you done something bad again? Why are you scared? It's you again! How can you get in? I... After today, James will be totally used by you. Poor boy. Wouldn't you sell him to the circus as the elephant man. Get lost! Or I'll call the police! If you pretend to cooperate with Lee. I guarantee that you cant at least earn 50 billion within a week. What do you think? You can call the police to arrest me now. This time. I won't let you lake the risk alone. I'll also pour in 10 million US dollars in this taking-over. Come on. call the police. I think Lee would be very interested in this tape. But will he tell suspicious? I think he can't wail to go bankrupt. Suki, what a nasty thing you are! You're so bold! So bold as to betray the most curing wolf. Don't you understand this is reality. Either you or me be out willed. It depends on who is smarter So when I ask you to investigate Wong. You use our fax machine to extort Lee for 10 million. Then you made me become the scapegoat. You're too confident of yourself. You're foolish enough to take Lee's lips and lost everything. So every body thinks that you extort Lee. You're just too stupid. Yes, I'm stupid. But I've learnt to be smart. This time I won't let you go. I give you 10 million for your tape. Such a bad deal, forget the 10 million. Even one billion. even you. all belongs to me. Actually. we're of same type. We are a pair. John, John... You silly thing, mind you! He wants to rape me! John...John! I don't want to see him. please take him away. Go away! Get out! Hurry up! Gel out! Right now! Mr. Lee. Noble Liu, you may sign the contract now. To our cooperation. Mr. Lee. Cheers. Thank you! Boss. someone sent it to you. You betray me Billy, take the contract back. Take it easy! Billy, tell the others to fetch the damned woman. Yes! What's happened? It's not your business. Miss Cheung, you can give it to me. I've got something to do now. see you some lime. Noble... What about me? You go to the other side. Was it you who sent the tape to Lee for John? Don't you know that it'll spoil my plan? It's me who sent the tape. Why didn't you stop him? I just want to take revenge for you. I'll take revenge on my own. I don't want you to commit crime again. What have I done? In this world. whoever gets the money power also gets the rules. You're still so stupid. That's who John called you silly thing. Can't you see what you look now. He's the most stupid guy I've ever seen. He knows everything but pretends not knowing. He saw you pushing John from upstairs. But covers the truth for you! In order to save you. he got himself burnt like this. Don't quarrel any more. I don't care how I look. Let's go. Don't move! What do you want? I want you dead! I together with Noble Liu and the Commissioner. Cheat you? Am I right? Yes...! You're correct. but you lied. I will punish you! You want to go ashore? I'd like you to jump down! Jump down! Jump! Oh no! Jump! Don't Suki! Ju...ump Jump down Don't Suki! Jump! Jump down Jump! Suki I've lost everything, Suki! Jump! Jump down James! James. are you alright? Are you OK? I'd like to know if you were... Yes. Really? I loved you, and I still do! I know I was wrong. Please give me a chance! Don't die! Don't Die! Please don't leave me alone! James...James! Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
