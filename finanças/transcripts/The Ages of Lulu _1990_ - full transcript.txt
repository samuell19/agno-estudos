THE AGES OF LULU Get up, Lulu. C'mon, get up. I'm off. Pablo's home with my brother. He won't even look at you. That's all right. He will. I can't go, Pablo. My neck really hurts. What will I do with two chicks? Take one to your Mom's workshop. I was lucky enough to see Pablo fairly often. He was my brother's best friend. You got an extra ticket for the concert? I'd love to go. Shall I take her? Lulu? If she wants to... Go ahead. I'll go change. - There's no need. You look fine. Wait. I'll do myself up... for the concert. Maite! - Pablo! Maite and Almudena. We had a date with them. I felt jealous. I clung to him as hard as I could. This was my chance. What will you have? - A gin & tonic. My, my! A gin & tonic and a plain gin, dry. Can I eat something? - Of course. Some strawberry cake. Have you got any? - Yes. I like your blouse. - Do you? Leave that button open. Young ladies don't wolf their food down. I'm hungry. - Or speak while eating. I don't like well mannered young ladies. May I have another? Me too. - You've had enough. Why? - Because I say so. You're taking me home? Do you want me to? I've always had great faith in you. I can't do anything. Don't worry... you'll learn. Come here. Not that. Anything, anytime, but that. I understand. We're leaving? What else? Lulu... What is it? Don't cry. I'm sorry. Really. Want to go home? No, please. Not home. - Where, then? I don't know. My mother's workshop. Marcelo and I come here occasionally. What dreadful shoes! Take them off. Take off your panties. Why? - Because I say so. Why did you button up your blouse? Open it. Take off your panties. Come here. Who taught you that? - What? To lift your skirt to sit on a guy's knees. I don't know. Come here. Ever jerk off? Come on, Lulu. You can't fool me. You must never lie to me. Once, with a flute. With a flute? Tell me about it. Now, listen. Want me to take you home or what? What did you stick in, the mouthpiece? The mouthpiece. Did you like it? Yeah, I did. But Amelia caught me doing it. And then, she told Marcelo. So, Marcelo knew about it. Now, missy... don't cry. It's not bad. Everybody does it, women just don't tell. I'll be right back. Pablo... It's just that... I've never been to bed with anyone. We're not going to bed. There's no need. Yes, but... I'm a virgin. Really? Here... Slide towards the edge. What are you doing? - None of your business. What do you mean? Hush or I'll take you home. Alright. Tell me all about the flute. Whose idea was it? What about Amelia? I heard about it in school. Then, I was home alone... but it started raining. She came back... saw me... started screaming and ran away. And then... What's that? A razor blade. What for? To make you even prettier. Don't... Lulu... you must relax. You must play according to the rules. I'm not playing! Sure you are... you just don't know it. You're almost perfect. Let me finish... and you will be perfect. What did Marcelo say? He laughed... and laughed. He laughed... and told me not to worry... not to worry because... he could shut Amelia up whenever he wanted to... that it was normal... that everyone did it. Did he touch you? He's never touched you? Of course not! Well, you're very close. Okay... All finished. You look lovely. It wasn't that bad, was it? Now, missy, do you feel better? Are you going to behave? Will you do as I say? Come... Come on. Are you mad at me? It won't be in a bed but we'll do it. Sit down. Lie down. Does it hurt? Do you like it? Do you? Yeah, I do... But I like it better if you're on top. Want to try? Here... Don't let it slip out. Move. Like that? - Faster. Move faster. Slow down. Imagine you're doing a figure eight. - A figure eight? A figure eight. That's right... That's good. You what? You're out of your mind! How did you do it? First, I got on top, and then he... - I don't mean that. Are you on the pill? I hadn't thought about it. Did he wear a rubber? I didn't check. Don't you care? I mean, really, you got no sense. Didn't Marcelo tell you Pablo's going to the States? Lulu! What is it, darling? - Let me be! Lulu, darling let me in. Lulu, please, open the door! Why? Why? I won't forget two things about tonight. One, the armchair where you shaved me. Know what else? The way this couch creaked. A letter from Pablo. Look, he sent a picture. He looks so American... Lulu, promise you'll always remember two things. One, that sex and love are two different things. Good. What happened tonight was love. I don't understand. - It's okay, just promise. I promise. Pablo is coming back tomorrow. Can you imagine? He may have forgotten you. - I hope not. Will you do me a favor? Of course. Will you help me shave? Shave what? My cunt. You're crazy. I'm not crazy. Today, we have here with us some very famous specialists. On my right, Pierre Guillot, from Dijon University. Next to him, Pepe Cepeda, my assistant. And, finally, on my left, Prof. Pablo Martinez... just back from the University of Philadelphia. Lulu... I'm so glad you came. How are you? - Happy. Why? - Because. My mother closed her shop, I'm making do here. I brought you something. - You did? I wanted to see you... You brought me something? - Sure. What? An American flute. What's an American flute? - You'll see. I couldn't resist... I thought I'd never give it to you. Gift-wrapped! By me. I'm glad you thought about me. All this time, I never forgave myself... - What for? Not having touched myself that night. - Don't be silly! You wanted me to. Shall I try it? I want to do what you like best. It's weird... It's got nothing to do with a man. It's... It's cold. It isn't warm... And I must move it myself... No changes in rhythm. No... jamming on the brakes. No revving up the engine. And I like breaking the speed limit. Did you do it a lot all these years? I always thought of you. Once... I dreamt... you were my father. We lived together. We were very happy. I believe you. I'd like to have a daughter like you. You were a bad daddy... Perverted... Incestuous... I believe that too. Look... It's for you. You're wonderful. Take it out. You did it on your own? - For you. Come here. What are you doing? - Can't you see? Come here. Don't move. - Be careful... You're hurting me. - Relax. There... I love you. I love you. Lulu... will you marry me? I'm getting married... I'm getting married... Married! The bride's something else, isn't she? - You bet. It's the only reason they married. Grandma, why is Auntie wearing a nightgown? It's a dress, love... not a nightgown. You chose the best sister ever. Congratulations. Can you imagine? They served frozen food! Yes, how common. Why couldn't you have a normal wedding party? This is more fun, Mom. Hurray for the newlyweds! - Hurray! A kiss! Let them kiss! There's no need to carry me! I'm dizzy... What are you doing? - It's a surprise. What is it? You're crazy! When did you get it? - This morning. You're mad... We'll lock ourselves up, screw all the time and never go out. You're mad! About you. I couldn't believe it. Living on my own... Pablo and I making love until we were exhausted. This was the best time of my life. Thanks. Antonio, a coffee, please. You like them? I like looking at them. We'll go watch them tonight. Hunting transvestites was one of my favorite games. It fascinated me. I knew it was unfair, unkind even. Wouldn't you love to suck me dry, faggot? I couldn't help it. - And ring my chimes? You're off your rocker. - Fuck off, fairy! Look, that one, over there. And that's how... we met Ely a wonderful transvestite. Hi there, love. Want a jump in the hay? Step on it! You love this kind of thing! Besides, when you want something... - That's right. Shit! I did have some problems at home... But Pablo never complained. This looks delicious! It reminds me of a girl I once knew... Let me be. Everything went wrong today. Take it easy. Dress up and we'll go catch transvestites. Get closer... Bastard! What's going on? What the fuck...? Don't you touch my man, do you hear? - Lay off, bitch! You shithead! Go to hell! - Cunt! Kill the bitch! I'm sorry... it's our fault. Cool it. You bet it is! Who the hell do you think you are? Hang on to her, she's got a temper. My name's Ely, with a "y". Pablo. She's Lulu. - Lulu! That's cute! Want to come and have a bite? To eat? I may sound Andalusian, but I ain't. I'm from Medellin, a small town. You know, the cradle of conquerors... I'm worried about having hit you. No, don't worry. - I won't. Whatcha looking at? Wanna see? Look! They look good. - Natural. Totally natural. They're pretty. If you want to... just for once... some free champagne in bed for nothing. I wouldn't mind. Drink up. - We can do it in the car. Not very romantic but I'm used to it. Stop! - Not here. Stop, goddamn it! Happy? Where is she going? What's up? She wants to see your prick. May I? Go ahead. Lulu's too much... Let me see... Let me feel your tits... Jesus, she gets turned on! Feel! Come on, I know a place! A little champagne will help us get along. For Lulu. Here, love. - Thanks. For you, darling. Goodness! It brings good luck. Luck! My, he's well hung! Come here, love, have some honey. Honey... That's it, eat it. Gracious me! It's still growing! I'll show you mine. Like her? I like you. I'm dry. Pablo... Look at my lips... C'mon, Lulu... leave something for me. Look at me, Pablo. Darling... I'm yours... All yours... I'm yours. Take me. I'm yours. Don't be greedy. Leave something for me. Let's see... It's incredible! Take me, darling. Take me... Take me... Take me... Me... Hey! What about me? Want me to do something? Touch yourself. I'll tear your panties. What is it? I'm all upset... I'm so silly, I get sad. I'm sorry. Forgive us. Ely! Don't worry... it's alright. Ely... whatever you want whenever you say. Lulu! How are you? You look great! You're looking good too. - Thank you. I love your blouse. Do you? - Really. I got it in a neat shop near here. Want to have a look? You'll go crazy. Will Pablo like it? - He'll love it. Don't get your hopes up with men. The older they get, the younger they like them. Believe me. Just because it happened to her... Pablo, you've forgotten your watch! Like it? It's baby-like... Where did you get it? - I can't tell. I must get to work. Good bye. Bye! I'm staying. You're leaving. Go away, they're waiting for you at University. Go away. You must go. They're waiting... - I don't want to. What do you mean? - I'm staying here forever. Duty calls upon you. I'm staying. You can't... What will people say? - Yes, you're right. I have to go? Don't you like it? I want more. Let's do it the way you like it. Know what I like best? To have you come inside me. I'd like to have a daughter just like you. Ines arrived. She was wonderful. I loved watching her. She looked like me. Pablo always said... he wanted a daughter like me... and he got his way. At first, she cried a lot. When she did, only I could quiet her. Those were peaceful, happy years. Ely often came to see us. She loved playing with Ines. I often wondered... if that was the way to bring up a child. Everything was fine. But it went all wrong. Chelo threw a party. She invited my brother. He was doing fine... making money... Here's the one who wanted to meet you. Lulu, Jose Antonio. We've been friends since college. She's my best friend. Jesus! Your wife certainly looks good. If she weren't my sister... Yeah... You should try and find a Lulu... - Balls! How about that cutie? She's been eyeing us. Some more champagne? - Alright. What a child! Listen, Cristina what if a few of us go to Marcelo's place? What a place! Are you an art collector? - No, I'm an investor. Here. I won't ever drink again in my whole life. I don't wanna play... You sure you won't back out? Not if you're here. You're wonderful. I'll gag you. Where are you? Here. It's weird. Strange. Weren't we all gonna play? - Forget it. What then? Should we go see? They'll call us. Come on... I feel dizzy. I'm sorry. I mean it. It's all my fault. Marcelo's my best friend. I had been thinking about it for years. I had no idea you'd take it so badly. I'm sorry. That's not it. It's just the last straw. I feel insecure. Insecure? How? Because I'm not the same for you anymore. I don't want to be a child. Don't you see? If I had said no, you'd have gone to bed with Cristina. Does it matter? - A lot. Do you want to wreck it all? - Listen, I'm leaving. Why can't you understand? I'm only sure about... not wanting to be a child any more. Got everything? The computer too? Yes, it's mine. I had never planned on committing incest. I liked the idea of him keeping my blouse. I didn't know if I was leaving forever. Actually, I didn't even know why I was leaving. It was all so hard... finding an apartment... looking after Ines... taking her to Pablo and having to see him... I didn't think I could bear it all. I felt powerless and alone... so alone. I couldn't look for another Pablo, it was absurd. Sex became my safety valve. One evening, I saw different... kind of porno film. Seeing two men making love turned me on so much. I decided to go for it. A Scotch, please. Well? Like them? Why? What's strange about that? Men like dykes and no one thinks it's weird. Why shouldn't I like gays? You mean you'd like to go to bed with them... and watch them do it? Sure... I wouldn't mind. Want me to talk to them? - Would you? You're not scared, are you? What do you want us to do? I don't know. - You don't... Listen, I can do anything with him I feel like. Like him? Touch him... Touch him. Touch him. Like him? Touch him. Touch him. Well? Aren't you going to undress? Look... See? That's a chick. She ain't bad looking. Like her? Want him to eat your cunt? Eat it. Eat it. Eat it. It's all yours. You're gonna screw her, like it or not. C'mon, come here. Sit down. Ever screwed a girl? It's high time you tried it. It's very easy, I'll help you. Please, no... - Kneel down. Don't make me do it. - Kneel, I said. Put it on. Very good. All you gotta do... is stick it inside... she's waiting. I'll help you. You may even like it. C'mon, raise your ass. Don't be selfish, kid... she wants some too. No, don't! Relax. I'll do it. Help me... Help me... I can't. Help me! Like it? She's come already. C'mon, again. C'mon, Pablito,... make her come again. Come on. Come on... I'm right here with you. C'mon... That's it, there you go. Bang her real good. Give it to her. Count it. Okay? I'm going to shower. You know the way out. I liked seeing two men doing it. Men like seeing women screwing. Women don't turn me on. I had felt strangely happy. I felt lost... I didn't know what to do. Just calling them up excited me. It's about the ad... Then, going to an hotel and watching them... while I touched myself. I got whatever I wanted. I couldn't stop. It was my escape. Some people eat when they get nervous. At least, sex doesn't make you fat. I liked jerking off while I watched them. Call if you feel like it. - If I feel like it? If I can. What do you mean? I can't spend that much every day. If you like kinky sex and can't afford it, speak to Remy. He's always at "Boy's". Who's Remy? - He'll solve your problem. Is Remy in? I'll check. Remy, someone to see you. Okay. Go ahead. Who are you? - Lulu. Are you Remy? - Yeah. Sit down. I was told you'd help me. I help a lot of people. Come closer, baby. You need dough? Not exactly. Let me see you. Stand back a little. Take off your jacket. You must do something. Lulu's into some weird trip. What's new? Yeah, but it's serious this time. She's taken up with a guy... Remy. He's got a gay bar and uses it as a cover. He's a real bastard. A pimp and he's done time. He's into S&M with out-of-town freaks. And I mean real freaks. Have you told her about the guy? She won't listen to me. Or to me. She won't even speak to me. She's crazy about you. Find out more. Can you? Hi, how is it going? Badly. I want something special. I brought this guy with me. I've got to impress him. Anyone in mind? I think so. There's this pretty weird chick. I think she could turn out real good. Lulu? This is Remy. How are you? I have something you might be interested in. Everything under control? A Bourbon. You're really going to enjoy this. Who are you? Remy sent me. Come in! Who is she? Come here. What's your name? - Lulu. I know her. We know each other, don't we? Where's the client? - What client? You're new here, right? Like it? I'm scared. I've never been here before. I know, don't worry. We'll have a good time. What's that? Come on. What's up? Where are we going? - Next door to see the client. Drink up. I'm not drinking and I'm going nowhere. You'll go where I goddamn tell you. Relax... Relax. How is it going, witch? Feel up to it? Tighten it. Don't scream. Like it? It's all for you. Let's have some music. You're gonna like this. Wait and see, you'll beg me for more. I'm gonna fuck you good! What is it? Why did you call me? Lulu's next door. She's in trouble. I'll fuck you! Slowly... You're gonna like it... Sure you are... I'll stick it right inside. Inside! Get going. - I'm scared, Jimmy, I really am. Quit fucking around! Think about the dough. If I'm not back in 10 minutes, call the cops. I'm going with you. - You're not, dammit! What are you doing here? Lay off, there isn't anyone here. This is my house and I ain't letting you in. Fine. Just tell my friend to come out here. Come back! Get out of my house! - Let go of me or I'll kill you! Turn it off! Turn the music off! What the fuck's going on? - Go and see. What the fuck...? Fucking fairy! - Let go! Come on, faggot! I'll kill you! Another drink. You're going to kill him! Stop it! Stop it! Have you lost your mind? You're gonna kill him! You're killing him! Police! Come on! Against the wall! Let go! - Cool it, bastard! You can't go in. Stand back. I love you. - Stand back. Help me... Help me! I love you. I've always been happy... Pablo, I need you. I need you. Help me!
