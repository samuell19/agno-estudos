IF PARIS WERE TOLD TO US!... "I do not believe that it is permitted in history to speak of the living. The image of public men is usually seen in a false light during their lives". Now everyone thinks Paris began like this: an island in the shape of a boat, found in the middle of a large river we would later call the Seine. The squares were deserted, but not hostile. In sum, it held promise. We presume that one day, a man came, he sat and started to fish. In this case, he is there still. This was 2000 years before the birth of Christ. We suppose that next, savages discovered that island and settled there. Were they Iberians, or Ligures? Opinions are divided still. Bless you. - Thank you. Theirs was only a short-lived stay.. A few centuries later, after innumerable invasions, coming from all quarters, starting to argue ... this corner blessed by God, that we will call Paris, was first called Lutetia. At first, there were the Gauls, led by Vercingétorix. Then there were the Romans, led by Julius Caesar. Soon, there were the Huns, with Attila, terrible ravagers come from Asia. Then came the Francs, with their favourite weapon, which they called the francisc. [N.B. A type of spear] It was a double-edged weapon. Some time later, a young girl was born.. in Nanterre, around 423, it is supposed she died in 514. This miracle, means without doubt... "without doubt" signifies that the thing is doubtful, in front of everyone's eyes saving Paris, from the invasion of the Huns, with an eloquent gesture, she stopped the exodus of the Parisians. According to legend, we might even add that, subsequently, she was not stranger to the conversion of Clovis. This is good, it's even very good. But after a while, it gets boring. We learn history this way. That must annoy you, I can see it just by reading these 3 pages. There are these the precautions taken by this teacher of history, this graduate enemy of graduates. All his phrases start with "we suppose", "we claim", "..we believe"... It is difficult to be interested.. in events about which the narrator himself is not certain. It is exactly because we love Paris, that we say: "Ah, if Paris could speak to us... with more freedom!" By someone who would abandon, if necessary, that implacable chronology, enemy of all meanderings! When a little fantasy would not be to your displeasure. - AH, NO! Tell us your ideal of Paris. You do me a great honour, but you've caught me unawares. And it's exactly that, which gives me the audacity to do it. Ah! - Yes. And it will be Paris, the Paris of yesterday, but looked at with the eyes of today. And told from memory. Ah! But my memory is unpredictable. She has her preferences and flights of fancy. ALL THE BETTER! - Then, let's begin. We start our recitation at the time where, without ceasing to be a market town, Paris became.. a focal point. - 1000AD? Around then. What was Paris, in the year 1240? Notre-Dame. And 700 years later, today? It's always.. ..Notre-Dame. Around which everything else circles. All the roads of France leave from in front of Notre-Dame. Ground zero. - Yes. And everything ends there. The point of departure can be a point of reassembly. And even, an ending point. Well then, gentlemen, let's think of our town, honour the memory of those who built her, loved her, then who embellished her to make this modern marvel. Rend unto Caesar... That which is Caesar's. By establishing his headquarters on the left bank of the Seine, Caesar founded the Latin Quarter. We owe to him this Latin language that has engendered our own. We also owe him this sense of grandeur, this sense of beauty that he brought from Greece.. and this predilection for military parades. So, allow us to consider the Battle of Bouvines.. ..the date the day when Philippe Auguste returned triumphantly to Paris. And that was only the beginning. 1515, victor at Marignan, François 1st rolled into Paris, bathed in glory and a smile on his lips. 1675, having conquered Alsace, Turenne returned to Paris, acclaimed by France. Victor at Friedland, the Emperor made a triumphal return to Paris. And then, at last, it was the day of the victory parade. Were you there? - Yes. Of all that I've seen, it's the only thing that's more beautiful than a work of art. But in all its long history, our dear Paris.. has not only seen parades by French soldiers. We have been subject to occupations when we have not prevailed. This one, for example, lasted 100 years. I tell you they'll go. Go? Who? - The invaders. I'm certain of it! - I've been hearing that for the last 50 years. I expect I'll be hearing it for the next 50 years! Butter, eggs, cheese? Yes, but at what price? - Ah, lady! A man who plays the black market is running a big risk, so... I can make some false papers for you. My friends! A terrible thing! One of us French is engaged with an English. Yes, there is one who fraternises with the invaders! Don't panic. I know the name of this fiance. It is the son of the king, the dauphin, fiancé to Margaret of Scotland, the daughter of Jacques 1st. - Ah, that's different! Oh, pardon. It's nothing. I know them by heart. Prince, to the women of Paris speak well of the prize. When we die by the Italians, there is not a good boy in Paris. And it's signed? François Villon. Ah, them! We shouldn't complain too much, it could be much worse. And it was soon much worse. You will never.. ..oblige Paris.. ..to bow.. ..before the fripperies.. ..of foreigners. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. - Why? Ah, if you'll allow... Well, yes! Then, it's a dream! This takes us back to 1430, when everyone thought: "..we need, to drive them out, an ardent young man.. "..and brave." However, it was an ardent and brave young girl, ..who delivered us. Long live Joan! When we are rid of them... Listen to me, you who pass by. When we are rid of them, move quickly with greatest urgency. The most urgent, is to think.. ..of the people, the poor people, who have lost their lodgings. We must build beautiful palaces, for the kings of France, ..more just, apparently. It must be. And I shall bow down to them. But now, it is.. to house those without lodgings, with greatest urgency. You hear me, kings of France? So, 22nd April 1370, ..Hugues Aubriot, Provost of Merchants, laid the first stone of a fortress, that would become the Bastille. They said.. it would defend Paris against any invasion, but the enemy armies did not take the routes.. that they had been assigned. Therefore, after construction, that fortress became a prison. The first governor, Mr. de La Personne, was welcomed.. by Mr. Aubriot, who showed him his work, praising him for his virtues. All this is magnificent, Mr. Provost. I give you my most sincere compliments. Governor, I am infinitely delighted. I would like to see a cell. Open the most beautiful. No. 5. Enter. Ah, yes, yes! It appears to me that this one brings together all the qualities: Health, aeration, thickness of the walls, ..solidity, the bars passed every test. And I would even say, comfort. Then, Mr. de la Personne, a little sheepishly, gave to his interlocutor a sealed letter.. ..which he had just received. It was an order to incarcerate.. ..Hugues Aubriot, on suspicion of heresy.. ..and sentenced to prison. - Oh! And I am the most sorry. - No. The second. If I'd foreseen something like this, I would have made the bars less solid. For 12 years, without resting, I've made myself hoarse pleading for the poor folks, with the large families and no lodgings. And I bet myself that in the end, I would be successful.. Well, gents, I have been successful.. and just won my bet. We should not be discouraged. It is not in vain.. ..that in Paris, we make ourselves hoarse. They now have enough lodgings. They have built the Bastille. Then there took place an event with unexpected consequences. Charles VII, who had abandoned Joan ofArc to her tragic destiny, had, morally, very little credit. His throne seemed to him in an unstable equilibrium, and knowing his unpopularity, he was sinking into a miasma of remorse. But an ideal reached him, who came from Touraine. Who was that person? It was Agnès Sorel, the "Dame de Beaute". Yes, of Beauté-sur-Marne. She came from there, to speak a couple of words to him, but, in particuliar... Sire... Sire, you can not escape that you are setting a bad example. A good example would have been better, but nobody's asking the impossible. Become a model of dissipation, of immodesty and perversity, if needs be. Loved or not, kings serve as an example. She is lovely. Get drunk tonight, all your subjects, tomorrow, will be blotto. But that's a pernicious example. I propose to you one which could immediately be beneficial. For Your Majesty, and even more for the Parisians. Paris is like a little province. Be careful. And here's my plan. Fall in love. Crazily in love, ..sensual, immoral. And so that no-one can be ignorant, openly, give me rights. Give me a castle, jewels and rents. All Parisians will be overcome by your example. In love with love, they will become prodigies.. and finally free of all hypocrisy. What is your name, please, madame. Agnès Sorel. Agnès... ? Sorel. Sorel? And we are in... ? 1432. What does the date matter, when the prize is so pretty. Your advice is certainly unusual, but I see certain advantages. So, this advice, he followed. So much so that his subjects followed his example. And in many a house, lived enchanting girls, who gave killer looks at astonished passers-by. But alas, they went so far it was soon judged necessary to put an end to their scandalous behavior that others had so appreciated. Remembering an ordinance dating from the late King Louis IX, and following it to the letter, all these girls were conducted and maintained in some houses requisitioned for this purpose. The shutters were closed and these reputedly closed houses were opened to all comers A new industry was born. And what of Charles VII.. and his beautiful lover? - He was dying of exhaustion, ..6 years later. Two great doctors, a famous surgeon, an apothicary and an astrologer.. ..forgot their Latin. - Althaea officinalis. That is "marsh mallow". Humulus lupulus. That is "hops". Agropyron repens. That is "couch grass". Sinapsis nigra. That is "mustard". And lastly.. ..Taraxacum dens leonis. That is "dandelion". And as a result, he will be saved. Two years later, he was dead. He was wept over, sadly, by all those around him, except by one, who had his own reasons to be more than satisfied. It was his son. He wished the death of his father, because he had in him the makings of a great king, adored France, because he was Louis XI. Oh, Comynes, my friend! My dear friend, good evening. How I am glad to see you, my sweet faithful friend. You bring me some good news? I bring better than good news. And the object over there, has every appearance of something that will please you. Because I am going to place before Your Majesty's eyes the first example of a book. The first that has been printed in France. Oh, yes... It's very attractive. It's very moving! Tell me, are these on sale? Yes, Sire. - Anyone can buy them? Anyone who is a subject of Your Majesty. Magnificent, certainly, but also serious! Think about it, anyone can buy them. It's frightening. How much does this book sell for? They are asking 2 écus. - It's not expensive. Of all the things Louis XI will be able to do for his country, nothing will be more remembered, Sire, for a long time, ..I can see nothing that will be more important.. than to have introduced printing in France. Because the printers, were fetched from Strasbourg by Your Majesty. Don't talk so much about how I'll be remembered, I'm starting to regret it. Two écus, my friend, think about it. It's nothing. As long as they only print chronicles, poems... but we will have to keep these people under surveillance.. Think of the evil they could do. You told them to renounce the idea of ever publishing the Bible.. in French? - They know. On this point, We are quite inflexible. The king does not want it printed? Ah no! - Even in Latin, the king will not allow it. - I don't understand why. Haven't you read it? - The Bible! Well, thank you. Let printing start tomorrow, when it's on sale, this book, in 40 years, you'll see what it is to say to the French: "Here are two religions, choose." The people are so wicked and so stupid that when I gave them the mail by horse, I thought they would use it constructively. Well? - It's sad. It's insane. Why? I have to open the letters that they send, I read them and think I'm going to blow my top. From Arras to Perpignan, fom Langres to La Rochelle, they spread nothing but bad news. To resume with Champagne and Brie, I have to stop that traitor La Ballue. In their letters, they all speak of La Ballue, of his tortures, of his pains. while of the 8 provinces I've added to the country, there's not a single word. I am hated... bent over, pitiful and thin, ... I am at fault. It shouldn't be that a king is ugly. But Sire... - But yes. Very much so. Also, I'm not going to allow anyone to make my portrait. But let's have no more of these worries. Continue our work, despite the hatred, and return to Plessis. Her Majesty the Queen. - But she's coming. Sire.. in the new appartments that you have refurbished at Plessis-lez-Tours, will I at last have the joy to occupy the same room as Your Majesty? Alas, madame, no. Because you are a foreigner. This precaution, I had already taken in my first marriage, with the daughter of the king of Scotland, which was good when Scotland was, in my eyes, the counter-poison to England. It would not be appropriate that the king of France, in his sleep, might utter some indiscreet words that might harm the interests of his kingdom. Is my personal army down there? Yes, Sire. Are they all well-armed with weapons in their hands? Yes, Sire. - Well, have them come in. Paris, I greet you. I greet you all. Because I want that Paris should be you too. I love my soldiers, I have affection for my workmen, but you, my artisans, I give you my honour. To be an artisan is to be your own boss. On the condition that he is the best worker. Be French, of course, but perhaps even more, be Parisians. Because it is a privilege. Carpenters from Cahors or from Pont-à-Mousson, you came to Paris to become cabinet-makers. You who make cotillons, put Paris in crinolines. Ironmongers of La Roche-sur-Yon, become artists in iron and move here. Jewellers of Nevers or of Clermont-Ferrand, come to Paris, to become goldsmiths. Goldsmiths, couturiers, antique dealers, you will find what you need from this singular king, who values artisan so highly, so that Paris becomes the capital of the world Another very great king would complete his work subsequently. Superb! Delightful, delicate. Marvelous! The movement of the arms, the expression of the eyes, all these things we can divine. And that embroidery, adorable! Divine. Ah, Venice, Florence and Rome that I adore, you send us splendours. I'm still waiting for two large Botticellis, of Padua and from St-Jean of Gianatto. You will soon know why these marvels are so beloved. We should know: they please us. No. Because they escape you. You need them, darling princesses. When I speak to you, I speak to Paris. Paris, full of virtue, lacking in qualitites, have you the grace and the lightness? I am not certain. Take this glass... because I attach to this glass great importance. So, take this glass and build around it a wonderful palace, which is in harmony with its colour and shape. And you will see before long that the Gothic has had its day. No, don't touch that one. It's for me to open. I'm going to take and introduce to you the most beautiful portraits.. that exist on this earth. Take this down. The nail is fixed? It is, Sire. - Thank you. Come. Everyone come, ladies. Prepare yourelves to discover the most wonderful of smiles. I paid 12,000 livres to its author. Few women have cost as much as she. She is called Mona Lisa. But we will call her, please, La Joconde. A queen of France, at least four times a year, must, if not enjoy herself, at least pretend. And without going as far as asking you to laugh, model yourself, a little, on that divine smile. My darling sister, you say, please, we should double the the pension of Rabelais. Tell them, it's good. but most of all she must learn, learn from you, how we are a queen. From now on, La Joconde is in the Louvre. We forbid that she leaves. Post guards, so that all the doors are watched. My lady, as for you, make me a curtsey. And come make love with the King of France. He asked formally because he did not want her to leave. However she was to leave four centuries later. A fool took her one day, and he carried her off. We are closing! [repeated] We are closing! Good God! What is it? They've stolen La Joconde! The following day, there was a general panic. For several days, the newspapers talked of nothing else. But, 12 months later, she was rediscovered and resumed her place. An extraordinary phenomenon had occurred in her absence. She had more visitors than she had had in 400 years of effective presence. It was above all the nail that interested them. Say, Gustave? Come and see. You know that Catherine de Médici had 3 children, 3 sons? - Yes. François II, Charles IX.. ..and Henri III. - And you never told me! The occasion never presented itself. Over the 9 years that we've been married?! That's you to a tee! How secretive you are! But... - We are closing! The gentleman just told you. - We are closing. Sire, I have bad news, alas, to give you. This why I wanted us reunited, all five of us. You, me and our five sons. Sire, the Protestants are organising. There's no doubt about it. And there is urgent action to be taken. You are listening to what I said? I hear you well enough. Because, Sire, in this regard, there is one of your subjects.. that alarms me greatly. And it is Henri de Guise. On that day, and for the next 20 years, until 1588, I haven't heard much else than Henri de Guise. Imagine, Navarre, what my eyes saw. Nothing but an early, sudden death. Or assassins. My revered father, the late king Henri II, died accidentally. From a lance in the eye carried by Mr. de Montgomery. My brother, François II, died at 16 years old. Suddenly. After having reigned only a few weeks, I was 12 years old, when I saw slaughtered, under my eyes, François de Lorraine, First Duke de Guise. Some time after that, I saw Mr. de Montesquiou.. deliver, alas, a mortal blow to the Prince de Condé. 23rd August 1572, it was the assassination of Coligny, by 20 armed men with the Duke de Guise at their head. And I witnessed it without any desire to have done so. And the next day, 24th August, that was Saint Bartholomew. Sire, what was it, this Saint Bartholomew? I didn't see it. But I heard. In my room, where I had taken refuge. And I cannot block my ears without hearing it again. He had assisted it perfectly. But he preferred not to recount it. God preserve France from another religious war. There is nothing more horrible. And Paris did not deserve to see such a massacre. The Duke of Guise will have his soul damned by that slaughter, which caused the death of 6,000 Frenchmen. I held a grudge against him. And some time later, I had him assassinated by the lords, and when I saw him dead, Henri de Guise seemed smaller than he had when he had lived. Sire, a monk would like to present a petition to Your Majesty. I will receive him. When I remember all those assassinations, the crimes, the murders, how could I not ask myself: "And now, whose turn is it?" Will it be you, Navarre? Will it be you? Ah! It will be me, gentlemen. Get out of here! Oh, the evil monk. He's killed me. The late king was assassinated by a monk. Our king should not forget. It should not be that Henri IV dies the same way as Henri III. Look, I was sure that he was here. Speak to him. - If I dare. Sire, we were looking for you. I was waiting for you. I always expect you to give 3 or 4 pieces of advice and 5 or 6 reproaches. - Sire, the news of Paris is very bad. If you procrastinate any more, the Crown will escape you and your soldiers abandon you. There are only 2 ways to fully possess your kingdom: raise battle, or convert. Between these solutions, will you make your choice? I don't believe so. - What are you doing at Saint-Denis? I'm looking at Paris that does not want to give up. You look at it tenderly. - Always when I'm in love. In love, so far, the king has been happier. I have not so much loved as whored. Sire, at the break of day the battle commences, so that tomorrow all doors be open to you. It is the solution that pleases me more. But alas, firing on Paris, is not something I have the courage for. Then you must convert. I will convert when Paris gives up. Our last hope. I received your letter only this morning. And you've come. Thank you. Are you alone? - No, these two accompanied me. What the woman wants... we will see. - In your hands, you have.. his Crown. - And yours. Perhaps. - What are you saying? How scared he is! Leave us alone. Right away. Ah, my lover! Yes, sir, your love, who has come to surprise you, for she's here to speak to you. - She has the loveliest eyes. Listen to me. If you've been sent to me by the bishops, to talk about conversion, or by my officers to talk me into taking up arms, you are going to infuriate me. I'm not here to talk about combat nor conversion. Everyone must meddle in that which concerns them. I'm going to talk about you and me. I cannot imagine a more charming subject. Speak of you, especially. You speak of me, it's you you're talking about. I was 2 months short 17 years old, when you met me. To have me all yours, yours alone, you made me marry a husband of your choice. Oh, the most perfect there is. The ideal husband for a lover. Distinguished, witty, modest and compliant, and to even more tranquillise your jealousy you chose someone completely impotent. I thank you. So here we are, all three of us very happy, him, you and me. You say you love me and I believe you. I, by jove, I adore you and I am faithful to you. If Your Majesty can say as much... Oh... - Good, I am faithful to you. And my husband is lacking nothing, except the main thing. That night, I slept badly, and I thought of a thousand things. What would happen to me if in two months, if in six months, I told you "I am pregnant"? Eh, I suppose... - Before answering, think of my husband. The poor fellow well knows. - Yes, he knows. Me, I know it, you know it. But everyone else knows nothing. It's not a thing to shout from the roofs. And my parents and many people would assume the child is his. Which, assuredly, would make me die of vexation. Let my love calm you down. If that happiness follows, should God will it, I will quickly marry you. And if you give me a son, in turn the king will divorce and marry you so that you may become queen. What name would you give our son? I would choose the city having the most beautiful name in the kingdom, and the name I would give him would be the Duke of Vendôme. I would divorce, you would divorce, then you would marry me. But I would like to know how you will do this. Because to divorce, many people won't be pleased, I think it will be necessary to have the co-operation of the Church. There must make peace with them. You think so? - I think so. I don't think so. You and me, we can wait, assuredly. Yes, but it isn't just us two. The third, will he have so much patience? "Third"? If we are to believe the symptoms and if the doctors have a little knowledge. Because the king, his mistress and the Duke of Vendôme, that makes three. - What are you saying? I think so. Pregnant? I swear to you! Pregnant! My love, I feel reborn. My most ardent desire and my dearest wish. Look me in the eyes and tell me this is true. I swear, looking in the eyes of Your Majesty, that it is the wonderful truth. - I adore you and am happy. I forgot! My God, pardon. The Archbishop of Bourges and the Bishop of Évreux are below. They had begged me to warn you, and I forgot. - The Archbishop of Bourges? And the Bishop of Évreux. - Don't make them wait. So, I can? And now to make this somersault! Any regrets? - No, my dear, I regret nothing. Haven't I promised? We don't regret keeping our promise. - And Paris well deserves a Mass. It's lovely. - What? What you just said. - Ah yes? Yes. - Well, I'll say that it was you who said it. And when, at last, Paris opened its doors to the king, with a speed we've never seen before, and will, no doubt, never see again: the enemy garrison greeted the King of France by doffing their hats. And what is your name? Armand du Plessis, Duke of Richelieu. What bishoprics are currently vacant? That of Luçon, Sire. You are Bishop of Luçon. Gentlemen, I have just spoken with a man, one of the most intelligent that I've ever seen. Come! - Sire, here's your double. Sire. I am at your disposal. You have all my costumes.. in double? - Sire, it will be so. Even my favourites with their tears? These are the ones Your Majesty wears most often. I want you to pass for me again this morning. All Paris knows that you are going at 10am to Mr. de Sully. If the gentleman replaces you, you could choose another path, and maybe also avoid a misfortune. Sire, in the last five years, fourteen plots have been attempted against Your Majesty. Come. I don't want to decide at the last second. Abbot, abbot! Oh, the beautiful child! The dauphin. - Ah! Henri V or Louis XIII? You have to think of everything and never forget, there is no bad accident that we cannot profit from. Sweet almonds! Make way for the king! Make way for the king! LONG LIVE THE KING! Ah! My son! My love! My Firmin. Now that he's dead, this nightmare is over. Come quickly so I can shave you. Sire, you were nine when I first had the happiness and the honour to see you for the first time. At this very place. It was the fatal day when your illustrous father was assassinated, in Rue de la Ferronnerie. Since then, I flatter myself to have served, at every moment, the interests of the kingdom and of Your Majesty. He could flatter himself! For, it was the reign of King Louis XIII, Richelieu governed France, and by the grace of God, moreover. Politically, I consider Richelieu the greatest that France has known. And intellectually, who? - Voltaire. Having learnt that these four writers, mediocre as they are, Gombaud, Serizy, Malleville and Bois-Robert, plotted against me, I subsequently had an idea. Rather than disperse them, I propose that these gentlemen constitute a real body, which should meet regularly, and openly. Understand that my proposition could be quickly enacted, that after an order, their acceptance could be with us today. He had just founded the Académie Française. And I desire that there be forty of them. Because I do not think a secret can be kept by forty people. Some time later, the cardinal had the audacity to reconcile, against their will, Louis XIII and Anne of Austria, had retired to the Abbey of Val-de-Grâce, telling the king that his subjects were saddened, to lose the hope of a prodigy ardently desired. The cardinal introduced to the king and the queen the papal nuncio, Mr Mazarini, so chosing a skillful successor. The queen approved the choice. So much so that a year later, Anne of Austria bore into the world a lovely child, who the slanderers declared, had the eyes of Mazarin. Since the death of Richelieu, Mazarin had taken over the reigns of government. The Church continued to rule. Cardinal? I must take you back to a most serious event, which occurred sometime - The villainous cardinal! Wicked cardinal! The child was king Louis XIV. I'm listening to you. The event happened in Parliament, the councillors were discussing in moderate terms the opportunity for taxes proposed by Your Eminence, one councillor, Mr. Broussel, cried suddenly: "Enough taxes!" And I think that this angry cry will have unfortunate consequences. Go find him for me! That he surrenders to my call this very day! Long live councillor Pierre Broussel! Long live councillor Pierre Broussel! Councillor Broussel, in the name of all Parisians, we thank you! Your exclamation in Parliament, "Enough taxes!", has spread across all Paris! We are touched that a man your age and immensely rich had the generosity to take in his hands the interests of unhappy Parisians overwhelmed, strangled by taxes! Long live councillor Broussel! It went well? It was not possible to get near him. In the streets, the over-excited people are carrying Mr. Broussel in triumph. Down with the accursed cardinal! - DOWN WITH TAXES, DOWN WITH TAXES! He'll never have our hides, and let him try to serve notice himself! DOWN WITH THE ACCURSED CARDINAL! - Never again, no more... FOR THE CARDINAL OF TAXES! DOWN WITH THE ACCURSED CARDINAL, PIG'S HEAD THAT HE HAS! DOWN WITH TAXES! Down with the accursed cardinal! He'll never have our hides! Have him locked in the Bastille... that councillor Broussel. Her Majesty the queen! What's happened? It should not be that he who I love be alarmed. Order from the cardinal, councillor Broussel, will you follow us? Ah! It's inconceivable, it's simple-minded. It's badly maladroit. As are, moreover, these taxes, which overwhelm us and sadden us. If tomorrow the government demands we declare our revenue, what will follow? We will be forced to falsify our accounts. And it will turn us all into liars. Did I say, liars... Thieves! This is what will sadden us. For honest people like the Parisians, it's saddening to become a thief! Is it, that these people who govern us don't know what is Paris? You must not laugh with Paris. She's an angry person. And when she shrugs her shoulders, the cobblestones of Paris rise up by themselves. So, take your precautions, when Parisians take to the streets. Ah, they've gone... It's nothing, I say it all the same. How? After 6 months, he is still in the Bastille? Yes, Signora. I believe that in your interest, cardinal... Your Majesty should not commit the recklessness of asking me to set free councillor Broussel. The idea sounds... soothing. Setting him free will start well, but it will end in flames. The important thing is not that he leaves the Bastille. My... An idea strikes me, that could reconcile everything. Come in. Councillor Broussel... I was waiting for you, gentlemen. This way, the cardinal is going to break my neck. There's no question of that, councillor. His Eminence, the cardinal of Mazarin, is animated by the desire to repair the injustice or the error committed in your regard, you are named governor of the Bastille. Governor of the Bastille? - I have to conduct you to your apartment with all the respect that is your due. But... Ah, really... Governor. - Governor. What... I don't understand... Gentlemen. Why? And the predecessor, what's become of him? He is there, in 12. - Incarcerated, already? Of course. A prison that is not dishonoured is necessary, in Paris. Very well. Very good, very good. And this door, governor, opens on to your private apartment. Perfect. Ah, please... do not inform my wife of this change of régime. She may wish to rejoin me. Cardinal, all is in order. A thousand thanks. Councillor Broussel has left his cell, but, he will not leave any time soon the Bastille. A man, an evening, alone in the night, was climbing the peristyle of the Académie. And thinking that nobody was looking, he went to the door. And there, perhaps he asked himself how he was going to open it. But, a carriage passed which stopped. Sir, madame de Sévigné would have a couple of words with you. She invited Molière to sit with her. When the carriage went away into the night, we hear Mme de Sévigné say to Molière: "..But Molière, your place is not there. "Don't you know that you are immortal?" 18 September 1698, on that day, returning to the Bastille, to be incarcerated, a singular individual, whose name nobody knew. He wore a black velvet mask. And so that adventure would be even more mysterious, we call him from now on, "the man in the iron mask". 19 November 1703, the man in the iron mask had taken his last breathe. And the mystery that surrounds him exists still. Well, we are at the Bastille, let's stay there. OH! - Let us here. Pierre Broussel being dead, Mr. Jourdan succeeded him. Sent to the Bastille for a pamphlet, of which I was not an author. Aren't you surprised? - Nothing surprises me anymore. I am asked to show you every respect. It is perfectly open to you to bring things in from the outside everything that you need. And your lackey can stay. I think so. - Thank you, Jasmin. Write Date and place of birth? Born and died in Paris. - Why dead? I have the intention to die here. - I don't have to record intentions. So, born in Paris, 20 February 1694. Your name, first name and surname? - Arouet, François-Marie. By the way, can I be registered under a false name? Out of respect for my poor father. I agree. What do you take for a pseudonym? Voltaire. This is the name of a small estate owned by my mother. I wish to be called Voltaire. The name Arouet could acquire a bad notoriety, because of this adventure. From this day, I will become unknown, under the name of Voltaire. So it is. Note this and show M. de Voltaire... -"De" Voltaire? Yes, indeed, while we are here. To cell number 20. The best? It belonged to the man in the iron mask. I don't want another. It is the best of the best that cell, for the anonymous. It's 10pm! Parisians, sleep in peace! Ladies? Is there not a home for foundling children? It's us who look after them, sir. A beautiful little one like that! You aren't ashamed to be separated? I am not the father! - What do you know? This child found on the steps of Saint-Jean-le-Rond was named Jean Le Rond, but he changed his name later, and he became D'Alembert. The encyclopedia was born. Mr. de Voltaire, I have the joy to impart on you a magnanimous gesture of the king. You are free. I've learnt it just now. Well, I'm not the man to question the will of the king. His Majesty desires to know whether the régime of your detention.. was to your satisfaction. They could not have done more. But I like the fact that the king no longer had me as a lodger. The king, that day, gave up the ghost. - The king is dead. Are you interested? - No. Good. Margot, the king has just died! Thus, he died at Versailles. - You can imagine. It is not a good thing for Paris. It is a considerable loss. Louis XIV? Ah, that! They will know right away. You've been fishing here a long time? Centuries! He's buried in Versailles? - No. In Saint-Denis. With his ancestors. But we do not say which day, nor what time. No. Don't look at me. The great grand-father of my grand-father was found here. Now, with the contempt for their morals, usages and customs, I kept his old costume and its gray green felt, with his little quill, ripped, he claimed, from the rump of a woodpecker. In our family, we discover it. We found the father of the son. In our family, we speak in verse, since 1436. Always speaking in such a way. If one of us was not found, he would become a troubadour. On the corner of a street in Paris, they need them, a troubadour. Because they sing, the troubadours, they sing of wine and love. And when they sing, they smile. It should not be in Paris that we could find a day free of songs. Because it would give the impression.. Because it would give the impression.. that we want to deprive the dessert. That's why it's needed, it's needed, a troubadour. A troubadour at the corner of a street, of a street in Paris. Everyone is coming, everyone is going. Everyone moves away. Everything starts. And the greatest of kings himself, in the end, dies. The best memories, in the long run, fades. The songs, alone, remain. Believe me. It's over, now. What's over? The kings. They're finished. Why do you say that? Because when you see the greatest king in the world hides thus, clandestinely, to avoid popular acclaim, it's all going very badly. We're afraid of Paris. And when Paris brings fear, everything is to be feared. - This monk spoke the truth, and the revolution began at first, by a series of small revolutions. It was the end of "spaniel ear" wigs. The fashion, suddenly, was for powdered wigs. Hello, illustrious Léonard. It's adorable. Who had this idea? Mme de Pompadour. - Why? She had two white hairs, despite her young age. This was the opening of the literary salons, which were going to play such a great rôle. Madame, what impression is made on women by the most intelligent of Paris? - Ask Mme d'Epinay. It was her who asked me to speak to you! Mr. Diderot asks if Mme Geoffrin wants to receive him. I cannot leave him at the door. Diderot, I greet you I prostrate myself at your feet. Mr. de Montesquieu, I am your servant. Do you know what happened at Versailles? At king Louis XV? No. Call yourself an idiot or a madman... It's different! Come on. ... came yesterday to Versailles, carrying a letter, alerting Mme de Pompadour that she was about to receive a box which would place her in danger if she opened it. How interesting! - Now, the box arrived, with an address in the same writing of a letter received an hour earlier! The plot became flagrant, the criminal was arrested, and, I think, sent to the Bastille. You're hurting me. Stop! You are Jean Danry? No, to tell the truth, it's Henri Masers. And in the future, it will be Jean Danry de Masers de Latude. You know why you're here? - I have a vague idea. You tried to kill Mme de Pompadour. You made a small box with a lid that would detonate 4 small bottles. You recovered powdered sugar! - It was vitriol. So little! This criminal act has led you to the Bastille. And for how long? The lettre de cachet does not stipulate it. Ah! You are not going to keep me for a year, huh? He was there for 35 years. Mr. D'Alembert asks if Mme d'Epinay.. will receive him. - Gladly. It's enchanting to greet you. I'm pleased to announce that Latude has escaped. Already? Is this good news? For him, certainly. Mr's Rousseau and de Montesquieu. A few hours later, Latude was recaptured and returned to the Bastille. - You escaped us, so you will now have a companion in jail. I'm not going to be alone anymore? - No, Mr. Latude. Oh! And who is this companion? - One named Antoine Allègre. I don't know of him. - An upper-class man, a scientist and, moreover, a unique type. If he becomes too fantastic, or is harbouring some dark project, you will let me know. - What? That I... ? I could lessen the rigours of your detention. Ah! - Enter, please. Here's your cellmate. Antoine Allègre, boardinghouse master. Jean Danry de Masers de Latude, army surgeon, heroic in the taking of Bergen-op-Zoom. Good, well, we'll leave you. - Yes. I know why you are incarcerated. I know what I am. For plotting against the Pompadour. No? - Yes, like you. And for having the imprudence to offer, in writing, 100 000 écus to her valet, to poison her. It's really funny! This helps us understand! To listen to us better, they've brought us together. For me to betray you. - Or that I sell you out. It's us who understand badly! - Because, together we shall have but one idea. - Their false companionship! In as little time as possible. Ah... If we had a rope ladder! Or more simply the keys to the prison! They opted quickly for a rope ladder. Ah, yes! Yes, but then, in another sense. And two years later, the famous ladder was already well-advanced. And six years later, it was usable. Well, this will work. This will work. Thunder of Brest! I hope this time he will not let himself be recaught. Alas! It's not good, what you've done there. Eh! - You have betrayed the trust in you, when we could have softened the rigours of your detention, which each of your escape attempts increases in duration! Well, inevitably! - But, I beg you to believe that now, all precautions are taken. And any attempt to escape would be doomed to a certain failure. Good! How is it that in our literary salons we talk about the escapes of the unfortunate Latude? Because he personifies the people, that was simmering, already. - Already? The French, until now, had never truly had political opinions. - Political opinions? You are a royalist, aren't you? Of course. But that is not an opinion. It can become so! - I don't understand very well. Messers of Rivarol, D'Alembert.. ..et Chamfort. - We need to talk. How do you feel? - Oh, happily alone! And frankly disgusted by human injustice. Have you given up on escaping? - Oh yes. And besides, it is no longer my age. Go, I'll accompany you. Mr. de Martel is close to death, have you seen the chaplain? I've been looking for you. Mr. de Martel is close to death, have you seen the chaplain? No? I think I saw him in the courtyard. - Who? The chaplain. What are you doing? - I'm running after the chaplain. Mr. de Martel is close to death. Open, quickly! I'll be right back! He shouldn't have said that, because 36 hours later, he was incarcerated again. I told you I would be back. If I found myself at the birth of Voltaire, there's that soon 80 years, I would have said: "My little child, the date of your birth "will be considered, later, "one of the most important of our history." "What was born, this morning, it wasn't only you, "it was the sprit of Paris. "Rivarol, Chamfort, Talleyrand and all the rest, "will follow you, and the kid who walks by whistling, "hands in the pockets, he is your heir." Because, let us give lie to the proverb, Paris is the only city in the world where the siprit runs through the streets. And I'm not far from believing that one could recount the history of France citing only witticisms. If I was 10 years younger, I would. By the way, how old are you, Fontenay? I am 102 years old, madame. Oh... The Good Lord has forgotten you? Shush... 102 years old! And during this long time, you have never wanted to marry? Yes. Sometimes. In the morning! I have always made a prayer, which goes thus: Lord, make my enemies most ridiculous! And God has always heard me. You will have your wits until until your last minute! All are as they were, madame. I would stop dying if a witticism occurred to me. But your phrase is most interesting. Because in short, you've just informed me that I am in my last minute. Oh! Mr. de Voltaire was then 80 years old. It's no longer worth it! It's no longer worth it? - No, you are free. Oh! And there I was just trying to get myself a nice file! Would you give it from me to the cardinal of Rohan, if he is still one of us. -Jean Danry Masers de Latude, on the order signed by Mr. de Breteuil, after 35 years of captivity and 3 escapes, you are restored to liberty. So, you are happy? Oh, well, eh... Yes, but liberty, it is something we take. If you give it, we feel like we're being kicked out. Don't be unjust, Latude. 35 years of captivity! Yes, it's true. And in each of my escapes, you proved how attached to me you are! Would it be indiscreet to ask you what you're carrying? Well, it's... my rope ladder. It's a pretty hue, but I don't like the design. Is it from Rose Bertin? - No, my own country. That shows. - Rose Bertin, you said? Yes, she's taste personified. I might even say she's the personification of Paris. Baron de Grimm. - Madame, great news! Latude is free after 35 years of incarceration. No? - Pardon. Do you know what he took? - The keys? Almost. His rope ladder! - Why's that? He thinks that it characterises the Bastille, she has become, thanks to him, the symbol of arbitrariness. He thinks big! He sees his ladder ending up in a museum! Well, there, he exaggates! Well no, he doesn't exaggerate. Follow the guide! And here is one of the most curious pieces of the Museum Carnavalet. No, madame, it is not here that you'll find it. And here is this most curious piece, the famous ladder of Latude. No, sir, it's not here. It's in the Museum Cluny. It was with this that Latude attempted... No, madame, the chastity belt is not here! She is in Museum Cluny! What, "oh"?! Do you think only of that? And every day, it's the same! This chastity belt that Latude made... How's that, "that Latude made"? They bother me with their chastity belt! No, come quickly. Look. Voltaire's armchair! It's from the depths of this chair that he said so many things! Well, I've had enough of my armchair! Huh? And I'm going to lie down. Lie down? - Yes! But why do you want to lie down? It is much better to die in bed. Die? - Don't answer him. There is no more civilisation than going back to the forests to walk on all fours. I don't want to see it. And now, my agony starts. Fetching. As successful as possible. This dress is for the queen? - No, for Mme de Lamballe. You created it for her? - There's a good way of putting it. One doesn't create a dress, one imagines it, one shapes it, one corrects it and one tries to make a success. Would you make me one like it? Oh no, madame! We never make the same dress twice. On the same model? On the same model? Why not 4 or 5 or 6 or 7? Do you see, at the Court or in a salon, several ladies in the same dress? There would be deaths. A dress must be unique. You are a Parisienne, ..Mme Rose Bertin? - I hope so. However, you must know... Ah, if I was born in Paris? No, in Saint-Claude. I answered Parisienne, because for me, to be Parisian, it is to be reborn in Paris. Being from Paris is not inevitably being born there. But that much is clear. Many foreigners are Parisians and Parisians a little province. On that subject, an old Parisian encountered in the mountains or in the sea, an adorable girl, with whom he was completely in love, totally blindly, who he brought back. A month later, he sent her back where he found her. She was pretty!- - What happened? He wanted to show her Paris, it was Paris that showed him up. I made her five lovely dresses which did not do well on the right bank, nor the left bank, nor on her! She did not go with Paris ! Here. "Death of Voltaire". "Voltaire before dying". "How Voltaire died". "Life and Death of Voltaire". Any joke needs to be short. I agree. But seriousness too, should be kept short. To separate... After such a long time! I die.. ..loving God.. ..and hating.. ..hypocrisy. The penultimate window on the right, it was that room. That marble plaque tells you. And that night, 500 people silently waited for his death to cry "Long live Voltaire!" No, nobody, gentlemen. - Albert! Yes, I'm coming. -Now, Voltaire being dead, the fear was not hostile voices from the crowd, but that they would get carried away, because the archbishopric refused to accept the remains of the great man. And those around him had an idea that was incredible, unheard of, macabre, diabolical. They dressed his corpse, then sat it in his chair, they put rouge on his cheeks and his wig on his head. Give me his wig. And a carriage stopped there, at the corner of Rue de Beaune. And as if he was dead tired, and not dead, two servants went down with him, like a poor puppet, all disarticulated. They put him in this carriage which took him 20 leagues from Paris, to a little parish where the priest agreed to put in the ground the icy body of the philosopher. In 1791, the body of Voltaire was finally exhumed, and carried to Church Sainte-Geneviève. It being tricky to put Voltaire in a church, Sainte-Geneviève was given the name Panthéon. The same year, the corpse of Mirabeau was also placed there, because it would honour his memory. Two years later, his secret correspondance was discovered, and he was removed from the Panthéon, the same day that Marat enterred because it would also honour his memory. They crossed on the stairs. After Thermidor, the remains of Rousseau enterred the Panthéon, when they were bringing out the remains of Marat. But don't be too quick. What are you reading? - Voltaire. Who are you looking for? -Rousseau. You like that? "That will be fine, "..the aristocrats in the lamp-post." - "That will be fine." That will be fine. - You'd like it to music? AH, THAT WILL BE FINE, THE ARISTOCRATS TO THE LAMP-POST. That's fine too. Thereafter, events moved quickly. Citizens, these are serious times! I must consider every meeting civic! One of us most commit himself, get up on the table and harangue the people. - Do it. Your name? Camille Desmoulins. - This citizen would talk to you. Citizens, there is not a moment to loose. I arrived at Versailles, Mr. Necker had been sacked! This is the tocsin for a St-Barthélomew of patriots! It's the little cannon that announces noon. Tonight, all the Swiss and German bataillons will leave the Champ-de-Mars to massacre us. There's only one way left to us: take up arms and put on the cockade so we can recognise each other! What colour? - Choose! I propose green, colour of hope! Latude, who was there by chance, suddenly stood up and began to yell To the Bastille! Did he want to return? We'll never know. But all the others went there. You hear? YES, WE HEAR. But such a massive event could not proceed so quickly! Oh, my friend! For me, that started the day of the première of Tartuffe! I claim it is the fault of Voltaire! And still more of Rousseau! - IF WE ARE ALL ON THE GROUND, IT'S THE FAULT OF VOLTAIRE, WALLOWING IN THE GUTTER, IT'S THE FAULT OF ROUSSEAU! Accuse rather Mr. de Montesquieu and his "Persian Letters"! Accuse instead lettres de cachet! Accuse Diderot, D'Alembert! - And above all Mr. de Beaumarchais! He mocked the nobility and has built opposite the Bastille, to see who was enterring to be incarcerated! No, gentlemen, it was to see them leave. And I'm going! How many are there in the Bastille? - Incarcerated? 300, 400... It's a shame. Nobody. Nobody. Here's one. Come. What have you done to be here? I killed a woman and two children. You arrived in time, sir. Look at that. Yes, yes, I see. It appears that they have liberated all these prisoners. Yes. All, indeed. I arrived at that moment and there were only seven. Here they are. Acclaimed heroes of the day. There were only seven? - Yes, seven. This is a most curious thing and the most edifying. Four forgers, an ignoble assassin, the Count of Solages, who deserved to die, and two madmen. - If that's not unhappy! Yes, very unhappy. But it should not have incarcerated Voltaire, nor your servant, or at least your master. Wanting to know who expanded the revolution, it's a most useless enterprise. This popular effervescence, which went too far, Voltaire is no more guilty than we are responsible. This revolution is a fact. We all can do is observe it. And she has engendered us. - Sir is good enough to explain. I'll always think that you are Figaro! All the lowly people have gone out of their taverns and their slums. They were not going to return any time soon to their dens. Tell the king that we are here by the will of the people, and we are not leaving but by the force of bayonets. The king and queen have fled Versailles! Run away? Gone away? Was he carrying the country in the soles of his shoes? We caught up with them at Varennes, they were led to the Temple. AH, THAT WILL BE FINE... They weep? Not at all. They are odd, all the same. Audacity! Always audacity! And again audacity! What?! You want audacity?! DEATH! DEATH! People of France, I am innocent of the crimes of which I am accused! I forgive the authors of my death! And I ask that my blood does not stain the land of France! DEATH! DEATH! Sons of saint Louis, ascend to heaven. Have her enter. He said: "have her enter", she enterred profoundly. Oh, wretch! Here she is, here she is! And then began this abominable tragedy in three acts. Death, to the Austrian! - Silence. Widow Capet, answer me. What is your name? Marie-Antoinette de Lorraine of Austria. Your profession? Widow of the king of France. You are accused of having taught Louis Capet this art of dissimulation with which he has deceived the good people of France, with a villainy and extreme perfidy. It's neither my husband nor I who have deceived the people. You had but one goal: to re-ascend to the throne, by walking over the bodies of patriots. - Why "re-ascend to the throne", when that was exactly where we were. Do you believe kings necessary for the happiness of the people? An individual cannot decide something like that. Silence! Do you not want to reunite Lorraine with Austria? Never. But you bear the name. One must bear the name of one's country. I was wife of a king of France, I am mother of the dauphin, I am French. I will never see my country again. I cannot be happy nor unhappy except in France. I was happy when you loved me. Silence! He would have well liked to break that silence that surrounded her. Finally, the last accusation, more serious than the others. Perverse and familiar with every sort of crime, you are accused of having led Louis-Charles Capet, your son, into indecencies, the idea and name of which alone bring shudders of horror. We are finished with the tigress of Austria. Let her be put to death and in 83 pieces: one per department. The accused did not reply to the question of Hermann in regard to her son. I did not answer, because nature refuses to answer such an accusation made to a mother. I appeal to all who are found here. Silence! They will surely take her away. Return the accused. HEY, STAND! STAND! STAND! STAND! When will people tire of my fatigue and my suffering? The jury having delivered its verdict of 'guilty' on all counts, I demand the death penalty against Marie-Antoinette, widow of Louis Capet. She will be beheaded. Do you have anything to say or request? The meeting is adjourned. Well, you see, when they guillotined the king, even innocent, I accept it well enough, but her, even guilty, it is unacceptable. Do you remember that in 1430, everyone said: "What we need, "is an ardent and brave young man." Yes. And it was Joan of Arc who arrived. Exactly. And today, we say: "we need an ardent and brave young girl." Look! And Bonaparte has come. The habit was established, and every month, every 6 months, the flags streamed from the windows. But time has passed, and 20 years later, the Emperor is in Paris, loved by his people. And His bourgeois Majesty, Louis-Philippe, asked if he had been right to bring back the ashes of the great man. He loved to wander, alone, in the streets of the capital. He thought it would make him popular. Serious error. The people of Paris prefer that their kings retain their prestige. And the dear man, in this way, prepared the revolution of '48. Will you, Mr. Béranger? - With pleasure, madame. We shall speak of his glory, under the thatch for a long time. The humble roof, in 50 years, wouldn't know another story. There came the villagers, to say to the old woman: tell us of old times, mother, shorten our vigil. Well, they say, that he harmed us, the people still revere him, yes, revere him. Tell us about him, grand-mother. 1848 after 1830. The same pavingstones become barricades. And this is how it has manifested itself in these centuries, popular discontent. Periodically, Paris has offered up a sad spectacle of fratricidal struggles, with all that they bring of heroism, horrors and errors. The literary salons? They are a beautiful thing of long ago, long gone. All we have now are dining rooms. Do you have any money? - Where can we meet the men of letters? - At café Procope! Like in the 18th century. The customers, alone, have changed. Come in. Give me the floor! I take it. We arrive in time. Flaubert is talking. First, it should not be allowed that the critics should be able to sit in a reserved place, as a matter of course, for these men of letters. - Mr. Flaubert! I am not addressing myself to you, Mr. Aubineau. I am a critic, and I take it for myself. You will never forgive me for saying of "Madame Bovary".. that "art ceases at the moment that it is invaded by the ordinary". I have a lot of support, for my thesis, that there's never been a good critic! That it achieves nothing, that it just angers the auteurs and stupifies the public. We criticise when we cannot make art. Like we act like an informer, when we cannot be a soldier! - HE SPEAKS VERY WELL! DRINK TO HIS HEALTH! Well, I, Edouard Scherer, critic by profession, I consider that I have the right to proclaim where and when I like that Baudelaire delights in nauseating images, doesn't know grammar, is not a writer, not an artist, not a poet! Oh, pardon me. It doesn't matter. I know them by heart. Here are fruits, flowers, leaves and branches. And then here is my heart that beats only for you. Do not tear with your two white hands. And that in your eyes so pure, the humble present is sweet. And who signed it? Paul Verlaine. The François Villon of our epoch. But excuse me, do not compare us. Villon is the only poet who is a genius without having read Villon. What merit he has! Triple coincidence: it is a hundred years today that those charming verses of Verlaine were made, hundred years that Gérard de Nerval was hung by a streetlight that was in the exact place where we find the blowhole of the théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, and a hundred years ago was born Caroline Delanoy, celebrated coquette.. from the end of the Second Empire. Yes, a hundred candles to blow. This is how she will go out, recounting what she saw. - It's here! Quick, quick! - As quick as that? Hundred years! There's not a second to lose. And a hundred! Come in. Come in, my children. I enjoy seeing you. And watching you... Oh, how young you are! You allow, madame? - Yes, yes. One more! Thank you, madame. If you allow us to... ! Are you hard of hearing? - No, madame. Neither am I. - Sorry! We came to yours because we are visiting Paris. And between the arenas of Lutetia and the Gallo-roman ruins, you came to see me. NO, MADAME. - You are right. It's fun to see in a second the entire century. And in such a beautiful house. Add "historic". - Historic. You are... - Journalist. Well, then, careful. I like particularly the reception. This one. It was the salon of Mme d'Epinay. On her death, in 1783, it was brought by Brillat-Savarin. The famous gastronome. - He was sick? No, gastronome, that's not to say... Let us pass. Brillat-Savarin, who from this salon made a dining room. On his death, Ms Duchesnoy, of the Comédie Française, bought the house. This place was a reception room, she made it into a bedroom. Keep it short. - Right, our century starts In 1855! Imagine then what my eyes saw. What I heard. And how many lips have been placed on my hands. My children, I of whom you talk, I saw Victor Hugo, Queen Victoria. I knew Meyerbeer. In 1865, I played at the Tuileries with the Imperial Prince. Ah, you can't imagine what it was, a party at the Tuileries, then. France is more beautiful than in the past. We hav powerful allies. - No war on the horizon. The Orléans and the Bourbons all blurred. Our campaign in Mexican forgotten. - We work. We're having fun. - We're getting rich. We dance. - Madame. Before the end of the month, for five days, or more, you will have in Paris three important visitors. His Majesty the king of Prussia, General Moltke et Mr. Bismarck. My God, what happiness! - It will calm the minds. What a great diplomatic success! - How important it is! Guillaume and Bismarck are in Paris! It is priceless. It's peace for 30 years! It's wonderful. - I'll dance, this evening. The emperor! Two different sentiments divide our soul, when we bow before you. The affectionate respect that we owe you, and the fear of tripping over our crinoline. I have come to talk to you about a petition that, if Your Majesty allows, I will deliver to the emperor after having written it in verse. Yes, madame, in verse and against the crinoline. We cannot tolerate anymore this chicken cage, which makes the crowd laugh and makes us ridiculous. We are looked at, we start shaking. In apartments, it's even more terrible. It restrict us everywhere when we try to move. I just had, at this moment, the experience at my expense. It is equally impossible to dance any other dance than the lancers Quadrille. The waltz is forbidden. And it is a loss. If the cavalier grabs you closely, the crinoline rides up and reveals your calves. And Mme d'Essling will tell you it's ugly. As for sitting down, it would expose us to too many perils. We overturn a chair, we knock over a table. What makes it disturbing, appalling, is it's like the frog in the fable, it does not stop swelling every year. If you cannot limit its growth, one day, like the Nadar balloon, we'll see a moving spectacle, the prettiest women in France will disappear in a gust of wind. Have a little patience. In France, nothing lasts for very long. Let's talk about music, countess. - Ah! There, music, careful. Because, madame, we have two species henceforth The first, without pretention, who pleases and entertains, who we applaud and easily ask back. The one who's playing at the moment. And the other who displeases, shocks you, annoys you and on this matter gets on the nerves, so that you cannot sleep at night. In other words, Mr. Wagner. You were at the opera tonight? - Not for any rewards. Oh, madame! "Tannhauser"! The scandal of "Tannhauser". While we were whistling the tunes, the public was booing incessantly and throwing missiles, princess Metternich, simple detail, broke her fan, dealing with this species of whistling idiots! Well, there's nothing like it, yesterday at the Variétés, at the repeat of "La Grande Duchesse". A mad, phenomenal success and deserved, by the music and the play. From one end to the other, she laughed. As for the Schneider, madame, she sang, which is no small thing, because she had never sung before. In her great performance, tell her we have noticed, she has been imitated. - Me? Imitated? Humming the tune. - I would like to, but... If the text comes back to me, the music escapes me a little in this waltz that they play. No. They're finishing. And his tune is what we're starting. Hum it. If it is an order. It is one. I lack his talent, madame. And his health. She moves forward, begins to sing... 6 months later, it was war. The German Army camped on the Champs-Elysées. While Paris suffered, the whole world was sick in the head. And it was Mr.Thiers who governed France. Gentlemen, our country has just crossed the most unhappy period, the most tragic in its history. First, there was a war. Then there was the Commune. More horrific perhaps than the war. Having caused the dethronement of the emperor Napoleon III and his dynasty, I had to conclude the peace. The National Assembly, by declaring that which I had deserved from my country, gave me the greatest recompense. To pay the indemnity of 5 million, imposed by Germany, I had to make a new loan. Now, gentlemen, I have the joy to announce that in 6 hours, the loan has been covered 13 times! The total subscriptions raised reaches 42 billion. And the liberation of territory moved forward 2 years. As of today, the republic is proclaimed. And governments that followed at a vertiginous rate. We have counted 103. For the III Republic. - They did not stay long. Nevertheless, they did everything, already in that epoch! Ah, that one! He was not content to construct the Arc of Triumph and 63 fountains in Paris. He did better by creating the Légion of Honour. Ah, that little red ribbon! With each new ministery, I sell it by the metre, it's that easy. Calm down, gentlemen. There will be some for everyone. And thereafter, we have seen that the idea, in principle, was not so bad. Tell me, what do you think of the new government? Well, composed in this way, he is assured of a majority. President of the Council and his ministers. General Boulanger, was he someone? No, he failed to become someone. There was only one refrain. Me, I can only admire our brave General Boulanger. Lively and content, we were triumphant, going to Longchamp, hearts at ease. Without hesitation, because we went to fête, see and cheer the French Army! A carriage trotted along, yellow with a white horse. It's delicious! It went very well with the metro style. It's lovely, this style? - Delightful. It was awful! - Modern. Louis XVI would have liked a modern Petit Trianon? It was good, the Belle Époque, then? The Belle Époque.. They infuriate us with that! The Belle Époque, my child, this will always be when we were 20 years old! And when was that for you? When I was 20 years old... we did not realise what we were without. I know Paris without electricity, without cinema, nor even the telephone! And without a single automobile! First, I saw her. I even rose up within her. But the day before the day I saw her, imagine that in the Alley of Acacias, in the bois de Boulogne, there were carriages, landaus, tilburys, victorias... And in these victorias, landaus, carriages, there were nothing but pretty women! And it was a sight to see. Émilienne d'Alençon was making a beautiful smile at Liane de Pougy. Prince Trubetskoy greeted the Marquis de Beauvoir. Cléo de Mérode was pretending not to see Baronness d'Ange. Sem was drawing, Forain was making words. And the prettiest, the youngest of us, laughed out loud, because Henry Bernstein and Baron de Vere they fought a duel over her. You can laugh at our hats and our turns of phrase, but they suited us very well! I agree, that on your motorcycles, it must seem very old-fashioned. But how would you look in the carriage of Marquise de Morny? And don't mock the men's moustaches. It was with them your grand-fathers courted your grand-mothers. It was Zola who saved him, because he was guilty, it is a fact! - That was never proved! It was because he was Jewish that he was put in prison and he was imprisoned! - Withdraw it, and you'll get my fist in your mouth! Hey, over there! There are ways of conducting yourself! Gentlemen, the Dreyfus Affair starts again more beautifully! We do not yet know the truth. We all know he was innocent. I'm free to doubt it. And it lasted 12 years. One year more than the than the reign of Napoléon. It's appalling. - Yes. But there is not another city in the world where they would fight like this, for the victory of truth. In short, these two women, they were what we call coquettes. - Or courtesans. Or hétaïres. Their sort has disappeared. Why? - Wives are cheaper! Paris, at that epoch, was the city where was made the best love and cuisine! If I told you that in 1885, I saw, Considerable advantage to be able to say: "I've seen it"! And you, what did you see with with your eyes, of 20 years? Well, do you remember a tavern, where they made the black market, in 1387, under the English occupation? Of course! - Well, you know... We know. - You know that in 1663, one morning, early... - Well, tell us! What are you doing here? - I'm drawing, madame. You're drawing? - Yes. I'm making a portrait of your tavern. I was here very early, so as not to put off your potential customers. Say, that's not bad at all, what you've done there. What's your name? - Jacques Callot, madame. Jacques Callot? - Yes. You can see that we can be unknown and at the same time have talent! The admirable drawing of Callot, we have to see him again. 200 years later, it served as a model. Ah, my friend, nothing more. A silence of death. I dare not look. It's too strong! Yes? Our demon is as gentle as an apostle. When we are struck on one nostril, we offer the other. We can talk about his nose, now. Eh! Lise! You'll see. Oh, oh! It's surprising. What a smell! What sir must have sniffed it? What does it feel like here? Wallflower! That evening, 28 December 1897, we are attending the first performance of "Cyrano de Bergerac". A blessed time for the theatre. 14 March 1900, Sarah Bernhardt created "L'Aiglon" and proclaimed that the belief of kissing France on the mouth when we are loved by Paris. A month later: the première of "Louise". Paris is celebrating. Paris... At the Comédie Française for 3 centuries, Mascarille claimed... - Outside Paris, there is no salvation for honest people. At the Odéon, we heard... - We only live in Paris and we vegetate elsewhere! - From then, Paris became the anvil of reknown. Who hasn't sung, danced spoken in Paris, hasn't sung talked nor danced. There, we lived 20 radiant years. The Entente Cordiale and the Franco-Russian Alliance brought to France a great appeasement. The universal exposition of 1900 seemed to be the consequence. France seemed to be the whole world: you look at me when I'm happy. O noble citizens, charming citizens! O noble citizens, charming citizens! Approach, please. And come to admire the most surprising phenomenon we have discovered on earth. No, don't look at the gap in the curtains. This is not where he is. You turn your back on him. It doesn't matter which one of you. And I prove it, because it was by chance that my index finger found him. Me? - Yes, you, sir. You, yes. I've appointed you. Come, sir, come. You must resign yourself, come, let them look at you. Climb slowly. Be careful, take care. Take the trouble. Remove your hat. Put it aside. Here is the amazing phenomenon, unheard of, of whom I spoke to you! Average forehead. Average nose. Job... - Bof... Average. Average mouth. Not satisfied, by the way. And then, he smiled. Therefore, this phenomenon, it's the average Frenchman, when he is from Paris! He thinks himself very clever, but when you know how to, we can prescibe everything for him, we can defend everything for him. Stuff him, like a turkey, providing he reads it in the newspapers. Ah, the newspapers, gentlemen, he believes them tenaciously! He's a man who wants to believe every leaflet. To whom they say: "Stuff that in your head!", ..and let it sink in! He's not stupid. He is respectful of institutions. He even believes in honours, in decorations. He is in truth candid and subaltern. He believes that governments govern, that ministers administer, and that presidents preside. But what makes him truly phenomenal, this phenomenon, is that in spite of his faults, he will always get away with it, thanks to the acute sense he has, that he inherited from Molière, thanks to that taste for grandness, which comes from a prestigious, sublime past. Thanks to that sense of the ridiculous, that is the legacy of Voltaire, and I've known you for such a long time! Huh? -600 years, my friend! 600 years that I have been singing and that I've wandered through the streets of Paris. Lady, the great-great-great grand-father of my grand-father has been found. - OH! In our family, we are found, we are found from father to son. In our family, we've spoken in verse, since 1436. The time of Chez Maxim's and of Mayol. It is also the time of another Maillol. It is the time of the Moulin Rouge, don't forget! Do you really remember? They were enraged! And Pasteur discovered a serum that cured rabies. Let us not forget. I admit that for some people, Paris is a dozen nightclubs with a negro orchestra and epileptic, but all the same, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cézanne, Rodin, Rodin, Rodin, are also Paris! Just like Fantin-Latour. Or like Juillard. And in the same way that the quays of the Seine, or the Hôtel of Cluny. And we had our preferences, then. And if we didn't like the dance of the inverted, we were going to applaud the admirable Bruant of Montmartre. The poster is by Lautrec. Daddy was a rabbit, who was called J.-B. Chopin, and had his domicile at Belleville. In the evening, with his family, he was swanning, singing, from the heights of Courtille in Ménilmontant. IN MENILMONTANT. He drank so little one evening, that he was found in the gutter, he was buried tranquilly, in Belleville. They put him in the clay soil, for an exorbitant price, at the top of Père-Lachaise, ..in Ménilmontant. - IN MENILMONTANT. You have sent me two floozies to make sure I'll be a cuckold! Since it's me who is the natural procurer of my little sister, who is the friend of little Cécile, in Belleville, who is pimped by her big brother, who is called Eloi Constant, who never knew his father, in Ménilmontant. - IN MENILMONTANT. My sister is with Eloi, whose sister is with me. The evening, on the boulevard, I offer her, in Belleville. That way, I don't do too bad. My brother-in-law gains so much, because he offers my sister Thérèse, in Ménilmontant. IN MENILMONTANT! But since we are in Montmartre, let's stay there. And let's see Place du Tertre, a small village square, that couldn't be anywhere but Montmartre, which itself couldn't be anywhere other in Paris. I will say even that they are necessary. At dawn, a painter is there, working, a poet who dreams, two beings who adore themselves. Some hours later, the square is full. The curious, Parisians, foreigners, they come from all over. And despite the noise of motors, the conversations.. and the noise of laughter, we still notice the two who adore each other, a working painter, and him there, it's Utrillo, the painter of Paris. A poet who dreams, and it's Paul Fort. While Utrillo, alone in the world, isolated in the noise, makes a new masterpiece, without doubt he makes his final masterpiece, the prince of poets, like Villon and Verlaine, rereads the verses that he has written and that immortalise him. If all the girls in the world would give their hand, across the sea, they could circle the world. If all the guys in the world would become sailors, they would make, with their boats, a pretty bridge over the water. So, we could make a circle around the world, if all the people in the world would lend their hand. And when evening descends, we still discovers a painter who works, a poet who dreams, two beings who adore each other. Let's follow them, those two. Where are they going? They are going to view Paris. They will stay there for hours if necessary. To see how night descends on a great city. Well, to celebrate it, this evening, let's illuminate it. Let's illuminate the Emperor. Let's illuminate Joan of Arc. Let's illuminate the singular man. Let's illuminate a great man. You, Panthéon, be as luminous as Voltaire. Illuminate for music and for dance. Illuminate for Molière. And so that the good God preserves her for ever.
