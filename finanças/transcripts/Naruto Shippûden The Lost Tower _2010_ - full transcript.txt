Hell yeah! (螺旋丸) Rasengan Spiraling Sphere It's important to keep your guard up. When fighting a Puppet user, don't get fooled by the main body. You need to look for the chakra strings. Why didn't you use the chakra blade, Naruto? If you let your chakra flow into the blade, and sever the chakra strings, it'll render the main body immobile. We told you that, didn't we? I know that already... But anyway, where did that Puppet Master, Mukade, disappear to? What's this hole? Mukade's aim is to get the Ryuumyaku from the ruins of Rouran. Ryuumyaku? It's a source of massive chakra flowing underground. Basically, it's like an infinite amount of chakra sleeping underneath. Yamato, take the team of Naruto, Sakura, and Sai and head towards the ruins of Rouran, in the desert of the Hidden Village of the Wind. For the treaty between us and the Sand Village, capture the rogue ninja, Mukade. Is that it? Mukade's aim is the dormant Ryuumyaku hidden within Rouran. The Ryuumyaku is an incredible source of energy, so the Fourth Hokage sealed it with his jutsu. Your job is to renew that seal! That's the Fourth Hokage's sealing jutsu. Who's there? Looks like you guys were a bit too late. I'll absorb the power of the Ryuumyaku into my Puppet Master Jutsu. I shall be able to rule not only the five nations but also the world! That's impossible. You don't know how to undo the Fourth Hokage's seal. I know that already. What are you trying to do? I'll just absorb the seal itself! On, Mayuragiranti, Sowaka... Damn it! Oh no! Stop! (木遁・大樹林の術) Mokuton: Daijurin no Jutsu Wood Release: Great Forest Technique Captain Yamato! Naruto! The light rising above the tower Thoughts boil and run high. Dragon path to be protected Pierce with a shining blade. Look to the sky. Sand, wind may rage proud, blossoming... ...bright sun dance in flowers and never will it die. The light flowing in spirals... Hey... Where is this place? Ah! Wait! What was that? Wait... What the... This place is... Awesome! Way tall! What are t-they? (影分身の—) Kage Bunshin no Ju— Shadow Clone Tech— They're puppets! Damn Mukade! Where are you?! Damn it, what's going on? What?! How many of them are there? Damn it! They're persistent! Naruto, why did you not use the chakra blade? Right! The chakra blade! Damn it. I can't take them on even with a chakra blade if they keep coming like this! Not again... (部分倍化の術) Bubun Baika no Jutsu Partial Expansion Jutsu! (秘術・蟲玉) Nipon: Mushidama Secret Technique: Beetle Sphere What's with those puppets? They seem to have been supercharged by the Ryuumyaku. So who are you? You are... ...a Leaf ninja, right? We're also Leaf ninja. You need to get that treated quick. He's really something.... to have survived my Puppet Ninja Force. This should help. Hey, who are you guys anyway? We can't answer that question. What?! Then, where is this place? This is Rouran. Huh?! That's impossible! We have no time to go into the details. Could you stay away from this city while we continue our mission? We could possibly tell you something after the mission is completed. Look! Turn left at that corner and you can leave through that door. Huh? It's a promise, okay? Hey... What's going on? Even if he says that... Right! Where is everybody? Ouch... But this is amazing. Is this really Rouran? Rouran was surrounded by desert. At that point, I... Right, I have to find the others. Huh? Queen! Queen! Queen! Queen? Mother... The light rising above the tower... proud, blossoming, bright sun... dance with flowers and never die. Sara... Someday you will have to sing this song... ...for the sake of the people's happiness and peace. Yes. Come. Sing with me. Yes, Mother. The light flowing in spirals To the garden where the dragon's claw ends... Sara-sama, what are you doing? The people are waiting to sing their praises of you. Please show your smile to the people who are here to praise you and your mother for building this beautiful city of Rouran. You have to lead the people in place of your mother. Okay, Anrokuzan. Queen! Queen Sara! She's the Queen?! Queen Sara! She might know something! Phew... You're safe now. Ahhh! Let go of me! You insolent boy! What the hell was that for?! I saved you, you know! Huh? I have to thank you first. Thank you. What's with this girl? What a ruffian! Are you the Queen? I am the Queen of Rouran, Sara. Rouran? Ah, my name is Uzumaki Naruto! A ninja of the Leaf Village. So this place is also called Rouran? The Rouran I was at just now was a run down rui— What nonsense are you talking about? Rouran is more precious than my life that I inherited from my mother. I really have no idea of what's going on here. Speaking of which, how'd you fall from that tower? It felt like someone pushed me from behind. Huh? Is someone trying to kill you? That can't be! There is no one trying to kill me! You saw it too, right? The people who came were welcoming me so passionately! But you were pushed from behind, right? That's... probably just me being mistaken! Huh?! You didn't keep your promise. I don't have a choice! She fell off the tower right in front of me! Wait a minute! Who are you people? Don't tell me you guys are after her life, too? Don't be mistaken. We're supposed to protect the Queen. Puppets attacking out of no where... ...and the ruins of Rouran becoming a great city like this. I totally don't get what the hell is going on. If you guys know something, please tell me! Ramen at half price on opening day today? It just opened today. The ramen is very good! Oh man! Yo! Jiraya-sensei! Hey! Hey! Look... ...and be amazed! What do you think? The secret technique that you spent three years completing! I've already mastered it! Amazing, right?! That's amazing! As expected, Jiraya-sensei! You said it! Well, I'll be on my way then. Huh? Oh? I want to eat ramen now! Teuchi-san's noodles of sweat! Soul Soup! Let me savour it with all my heart! The Will of Fire transmits the special flavour well... Oh man! How easy it is for you guys to be impressed just by ramen! What?! Hatake Kakashi! You're lining up too, aren't yo— Minato-sensei! You're lining up too, aren't yo— Minato-sensei! A mission? Yeah. Get everyone together. Hey, what about Tuechi-san's ramen! Well, I am not as free as you lot. What a jerk! No doubt. The mission briefing is as mentioned. Namikaze Minato, Akimichi Choza, and Aburame Shibi... ...head for Rouran right away. I understand. Third Hokage. I want to add Hatake Kakashi to this mission... You have a plan in mind? Yes. He is young, but a very talented ninja. Okay then. That's Rouran. Minato-sensei, what should I do? I have a task for you. You will do it, right? Yes! I will do my best! No choice then. I didn't want to talk, but I shall explain it as well as I can. We are here on a top secret mission from the Hidden Leaf. Time traveler... ...this is indeed not the Rouran that you know. If I am right, you must be from the future. The future? The future?! Yes. I kept you in the dark mainly not to interfere with flow of time. It'd change drastically if people from the future get involved in this era. This is most likely twenty years before your time. There was a ninja who came from the future six years ago. He came suddenly like you. His name is Mukade. Huh?! The guy we were after is called Mukade too! Ahhhh! Now I really don't get what the hell is going on! Could you tell me what happened to you? We might be able to help. We chased Mukade to the Ryuumyaku. When we got there, he absorbed the seal. And then... So you and Mukade came from the future using space-time ninjutsu. I'm not sure, but does this mean that I can't go back? Since Mukade absorbed the seal into him, you should defeat him. Then, time should return to normal and you should be able to return to the future. Really?! In any case, if Mukade is not defeated as soon as possible, history will change further. I remember! I thought I saw your face somewhere... His face is the same as the Fourth Hokage carved in stone! That must be a joke. Our Hokage is still the 3rd one. But this boy is from the future, right? Let's stop talking about the future. History will change further with us knowing needless things. Huh?! The power of the Ryuumyaku sleeps beneath Rouran... ...so Mukade must be using it to develop his puppets. I'll absorb the power of the Ryuumyaku into my Puppet Master Jutsu. I shall be able to rule not only the five nations but also the world! Speaking of that, Mukade did say something lik— Silence! Enough lies from all of you! It wasn't a ninja called Mukada whom appeared in this city six years ago, but a great man named Anrokuzan. Anrokuzan is now working as a minister for the good of this city, in the spirit of my mother. I can't imagine a peace loving man like him developing weapons. Your majesty, I'm afraid you're being deceived by that man. I don't beleive you! All of you are more suspicious than he is! Hey, where are you going? I'll go and ask him myself! Someone is after your life, right? It might be A-Ankoro... Mukade's doing, you know! Let's split up. You protect her majesty. I can protect Sara, but I also have to capture Mukade. It's because we let him escape that things are in a mess now. It's best that I look for him since I know this place well. Furthermore, I can't add you to my team in the middle of the mission. You should understand that being a Leaf ninja, right? It is important to protect Sara's life, too. Argh, I get it already! I can't leave Sara alone either. Huh? Take this. Huh?! I think I've seen this before. This is my specially made kunai. I'll be able to get to you no matter where you are with this. The seal on this kunai... Which means he's really... Hey, dude... Hurry and go! We don't have a minute to lose! I get it already. I am counting on you to protect Sara. Naruto and that ninja don't know anything about Anrokuzan. How dare they say such things about him! Where'd she go?! I shall prove Anrokuzan's innocence! These people... So there really is someone after my life. Are you the real Sara-sama? I am Queen Sara! If you want my life, try taking it without sneaking around! Return it to us. Huh? "Return it"? If not, we don't know what we will do! Return it! Return it! All of us are serious! Sara! Get away from Sara! Help! Spare my life! Huh?! What? You guys are all... I am Sara. I am one of the bad guys! I'm sorry. My name is Masakoto. We have a favor to ask of Sara-sama. What is this about? What do you want me to return to you? It's beautiful. Huh?! The parade seen from here is much more beautiful. Oh man... This parade was started by Anrokuzan. It was to cheer me and the people up from my mother's sudden death. That's strange. What's strange? Everyone makes fun of Sara-sama, calling you a puppet princess. Puppet princess... Stupid! Shut your mouth! Sorry! I am sorry, your majesty. But there is some truth in what Sara said. Everyone had their family taken away one morning, being told it was Sara-sama's command. Really? That's a lie! I never gave such a command! It's true! My father and big brother were taken away. There are rumors that there are weapons being made in this country for war. So everyone is here to beg Sara-sama directly. It's the same as the masked guy said. That's a lie! Then why do so many of the people welcome me so passionately? There is no one happy. What are you saying? There are so many people enjoying themselves! Look, it's a puppet... They're all... ...puppets! Sara! Look closely, alright? Chakra strings are coming out from that pipe. The power of the Ryuumyaku feeding the city is flowing in that pipe. That pipe is feeding Chakra to the puppets. What's... ...that? Mukade wants to make you a puppet, too! No! That's a lie! Anrokuzan would never do that! Hey, Sara! Where are you going! Wait! Sara! Where did she go? Dragon path to be protected... That's the song you sang when we first met. It's a song that my mother always sang. It's Anrokuzan who persuaded my mother to use the power of the Ryuumyaku for the sake of the people. With my mothers control of the power of the Ryuumyaku and Anrokuzan's technology, Rouran grew into a city with thousand towers in no time. But Mother died in the middle of fulfilling her wish. Anrokuzan was the only one with me by my side when she died. There was no one else. I have no parents either. But I have a master called Ero-sennin. Though he's dead now. But I learned many important things from him. My ninja way together with my strong will is... ...also inherited from my master. You got something important from your mother, too, right? Yes. Then think about what your mother valued. You should then know what to do now. Do what you have to! And don't bend over, no-matter what! I must first find out the truth about this city. The Queens have... ...the ability to sense the flow of the Ryuumyaku. If I can confirm where the Ryuumyaku of that pipe is connected to, then... Alright! This exhaust pipe is the relay point transmitting the Ryumraku flow. If we find your family, we'll definitely rescue them. So, please wait here with your friends. Really? I swear on my honor as Queen! Let's go back. It's a promise, okay? Leave it to us! Let's go. All right. This is... Puppet soldiers! I can't believe it! Anrokuzan kidnapped the citizens to create these soldiers. What should we do? We need to stop this immediately. Take me there. Hurry, please. The Ryuumyaku can be stopped from there. Alright, hold on tight! Please stand back. This is an order from the Queen, stop and control the flow of the Ryuumyaku. Kyuu Kyuu Noritsuyo This should do it. I've completely stopped the flow of the Ryuumyaku directed to the factory. Great. Come on, let's get out of here. What are you doing there, my Queen? Anrokuzan! Huh?! He's Anrokuzan?! I have stopped the flow of the Ryuumyaku! I will not allow you to use this power for war! I command you as the Queen... ...stop the production of the puppet weapons and release the people on forced labor right this instant! Oh, so you found out. Which means, I can't let you live then. A puppet will be enough to replace you, since the puppet army is already finished. I no longer need you to control the Ryuumyaku. Sara. Take everyone and run! Huh?! I'll capture him! Go, quick! Okay. Are you really Mukade? You grew into quite a pig! You, Leaf ninja, told the Queen some useless information. It's been six years since we last met, eh? For me it was just like yesterday! I don't care if you grew fat. but if you are Mukade, then I will not spare you! Mukade, you say? I had forgotten that roughneck's name. I am the minister of Rouran, Lord Anrokuzan! What "Lord"?! I told you I've finished the puppet army. I'll open up a path! Run as fast as you can! Okay. (影分身の術) Kage Bunshin no Jutsu Shadow Clone Technique Now! Run! All right! What's this about? Naruto... You can't get out. You can't use or feel your strength, I assume? That's because that puppet is draining your chakra. Stop it, Anrokuzan! I give you my eternal thanks, Sara-sama. You've helped to fulfill my great ambition... ...in place of your dead mother. But you are of no use to me now. Die like your mother. You... killed... my mother?! You finally figured it out. Your mother was a cunning Queen. She saw through me and refused to assist me. You are a great puppet. Just like one of mine. But, it's time to replace you with a real puppet. Mukade! Your enemy is me! Sara, hang in there! You are... You are not a puppet! What is this tremendous amount of chakra?! This is no time to be crying! Do what... ...you have to! I'll beat him up for you! What can you do now? You can do nothing! You fool! I am invincible. Look, this is my ultimate body! What is that thing? Die here with Sara! It's useless to run! Damn it! Are you all right? What? You did well. Explode! Protect the Queen now! Sara, go quick! Take everyone to the surface! Right. (影分身の術) Kage Bunshin no Jutsu Shadow Clone Technique Let's go! Alright! Sara, you are not getting away! Rasengan! Everyone! Let's run! It's dangerous in here! Come, remove your chains quickly. Please follow me. Your families are waiting for you on the surface. Come, this way. You can still move? Don't let your guard down. We still don't know the limits of his power. Do you think you can beat me like this. I told you I am invincible. Despicable! Multiple Shadow Clone Technique (多重影分身の術) Taji Kage Bunshin no Jutsu Choza! Leave it to me! Partial Multi-Size Technique (部分倍化の術) Bubun Baika no Jutsu You bastard! Shibi! (秘術・蟲玉) Nipon: Mushidama Secret technique: Beetle Sphere! What?! Did we get him? Still? Allow me to show you the ultimate power of the puppet weapon. A new body for me! What? Father! Nii-chan! Honey! Sara. Oh. Thank you! Sara-sama, you kept your promise! Everyone! Move away from here quick! It's dangerous! Okay! Bastard! I will never let go! Naruto! Sara, we will take care of things here, so take everyone and run! But... You have to protect everyone! You are the Queen! I understand. That's right... Everyone, follow me. Where are we going? Let's go to the central tower. Huh? Why? Father, Nii-chan... ...let's go. Please! Trust me! Everyone, let's trust the Queen! All right. Come, this way! Your opponent is me! Don't interfere, Leaf brat! Why is Mukade so hung up on going after Sara? There must be a special reason for that. Naruto, protect Sara-sama for a while more! Huh? We have something we need to do! Leave it to me! Counting on you. You bet! Why am I obeying him without hesitation, I wonder? Well, never mind. Once we get here, the towers become walls of defense so that monster will not be able to come near. No, it can't be. Sara! Sara! Everyone, stay back! Sara-sama! I can't move. Run. Sara! You are a useless and stupid puppet princess. Your role here is finished. Die quietly. Naruto. You are not a puppet princess. Do what you have to! Damn it! Naruto... What I have to do... Mother... Dragon path to be protected. Pierce with the shining blade. Look to the sky. The light flowing in spirals. To the garden where the dragon's claw ends. Shadows of the olden days. Sorry for being so late. No problem! Naruto! I can stop the source of the Ryuumyaku and protect the people! I see. That's why Anrokuzan was after your life. Anrozukan can't withstand the power of the Ryuumyaku at the garden where you and I first met, so he could not go there! Right there! Sara! Right! Everyone, there is a safe place near the Ryuumyaku. Let's all go there! There, that monster should not be able to reach us! Come, let's go! Ah! Come on everyone, let's go! Right, let's go! Right! Let's go! Follow Queen Sara! Together with Queen Sara! Sara! I cannot let you live. Go, Sara! Don't give up! Yes! Everyone hurry! You are not gett— Wait! You are not gett— Wait! This is our job. Huh? You protect Sara. We can gain more time by splitting up. What are you guys saying? They're right. He's a tough one. It's better we draw multiple lines of defense. But... Please hurry, everyone! Get to the underground here! Trust us. Go! Come, let's go. I got it. Counting on you. Sara! I will not let you get to the Ryuumyaku! Say that... ...after you beat us! What? The ground's... Ninja Art: Insect Illusion Technique (にんぽもしど もしの じゅつ) Ninpo: Moshido mo Shino Jutsu Freak. This is the end for you! My insects will suck your chakra dry! The rest is up to you, Choza! Leave it to me! Alright! His Chakra is increasing?! Chakra that even my insects can't suck dry? This amount of Chakra is nothing! Either way he's just a puppet, so there must be a limit to the amount of chakra he can store. No, his Chakra is unlimited. Looks that the tower is transmitting plasma chakra to him... Spinning Puppet Attack! I knew it... What's up? He's absorbed the power of the Ryuumyaku. If we don't seal the power of the Ryuumyaku, his chakra will continue to increase. What the hell?! Even so, he must have a weakness. What the...? Anrokuzan! Sara! Get everyone to safety, quick! Understood. Come, everyone. I can't let you pass! Rasengan! I shall hold here! You go protect Sara! But... We can't fight him head on. I have a way to know his weakness! So just go! I got it. (手裏剣影分身の術) Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique So that's his weakness! What? He's regenerating too fast! The garden is beyond these stairs! The power of the Ryuumyaku cannot reach there! He's coming! Hurry, Sara! Right! No way! What's wrong? The mechanism in the door must'ce been damaged when the tower collapsed. Huh?! The door's damaged? What will happen to us? Is there nowhere else we can run? Go!! (影分身の術) Kage Bunshin no Jutsu Shadow Clone Technique Honey! Are you all right? Take this! Bastard! Once more! Naruto! (影分身の術) Kage Bunshin no Jutsu Shadow Clone Technique Please! Open! Open! Please... Everyone! Let's help! Everyone... Come on, everyone! Put your strength into it! Alright! We're saved! Come, everyone, let's go inside! Let's hurry! Come, everyone, let's go inside! Yay! Come, everyone, let's go inside! Yay! Sara-sama! Sara-sama? I still have something I have to do. Naruto! Damn it! Everyone has evacuated to the garden! Great. I found you, Sara! Anrokuzan's power is infinite until we stop the source of the Ryuumyaku. I will stop it! Ya. I'm counting on you. I know. I will stop him here! (多重影分身の術) Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu Multiple Shadow Clone Technique Hang in there! You impudent little brat! It's not over yet! (龍脈 りゅうか の) Ryuumyaku Ryuuka no Ryuumyaku Dragon Fire! What a huge amount of chakra... But... I can't let him get past here! Stop the source of the Ryuumyaku! There is only one way then! Yeah! Alright! It's all yours! Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken (風遁・螺旋手裏剣) Fuuton: Rasen Shuriken Eat this! What? Naruto! What's the matter, Leaf brat! Damn it. I don't have enough chakra... Is that all you have? Die! Are you all right? I will open up his weakness! Then you hit him with your Rasengan! It's no use. I can't bring up my chakra anymore... I will lend you mine. That's impossible! Rasengan is a technique that the 4th Hokage completed. Only Ero-sennin and I can use it... Then, I can do it too. Come put out your right hand! Alright. So you still have chakra left. Rasengan?! What the hell is going on? Similar types of chakra resonates when they are close. When these two Chakra combine, then the strongest Rasengan can be formed! What is this? This is the legendary Super Rasengan! What is that jutsu? I shall kill you before I kill Sara! Let me show you my strongest skill! Ryuumyaku! Super Dragon Fire Jutsu! (手裏剣影分身の術) Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique Accelerated Regeneration Jutsu... Naruto! His weak point is there! Damn it! Sara! The rest is up to you! Ok! Leave it to me! Oh no you don't! Super Rasengan! Take this! What?! The Five Shinobi Countries... History should have been mine!! I can't die like this! You all are going to... Die together with me and the Ryuumyaku... This is bad. The Ryuumyaku's going to erupt... Sara! Run! Don't let go... Watch out! Wood Release! Captain Yamato! Everyone! I made it... The Flying Thunder God Kunai I gave you! Let's seal the Ryuumyaku completely! Here... Seal! What? When Anrokuzan died, the seal returned, so time is returning to normal again. It's time for you guys to go back to your time. Kakashi, seems you have done you mission well. Kakashi Sensei?! I saved this Konoha person too! He was lazing around in front of the gates of Rouran... Ouch! Why did you hit me? Well, I was always bullied by you, you see. There you go. It's an honour to meet you. Huh?! Captain Yamato this dude is... Sorry, but it's time to say farewell. No, it's already time to part? Ah, yeah. Sara, you did what you had to, right? You are already a great Queen! You will be fine even without us around. Yes, I will never forget you, Naruto. It is better to lose this memory in order not to change history. Let's wipe out our memories, okay? Wait a minute! Before that, you said that we would have a talk, right? Yeah. But not now. I am sure I will meet you once again. No way! You said you had something to say to me! If you don't tell me now, you wouldn't have a second chance! One day. I think you would surely know. Metsu! Dude! You can't possibly be my... If I have a son, I will wish that... ...he would be brought up as a ninja like you. Naruto! Rouran might dissapear as you said. But I have the people of Rouran with me! I will do what I have to for the people! It's what you taught me, Naruto! Yeah! If you have the guts, you will surely be able to do it! Naruto! Naruto! You alright, Naruto?! Captain Yamato! What is going on? I can't remember anything. Ah... I wonder what happened? Mukade is still missing, huh? What's up Sakura-chan, getting up all of a sudden! Huh?! I passed by and felt the disturbance in the Ryuumyaku, so I came to take a look... Disturbance? My mother was a Quen who used to rule this land of Rouran. So if I use this, I would be able to feel... ...the pulse of the Ryuumyaku slightly. What the?! That's a Konoha chakra blade. It's my mother's treasure. She said it was handed to her by a hero in a dream. Your mother huh? Yes. The city of Rouran vanished in the war. But the people survived because of my mother. I will inherit my mother's will and continue to live with the people. Sorry for disturbing you. No problem... Well then... What is it, I wonder? I seem to have met her before... What are you spacing out for? You perv! Ouch! No, it's not that! You must have dreamt a perverted dream while you were passed out. I didn't have any dream like that! It was more like a sweeter dream than that. Ah, so it was a perverted dream after all then! Hey, believe me, it was a sweet dream! You're too good to be true! It's the truth Sakura-chan!
