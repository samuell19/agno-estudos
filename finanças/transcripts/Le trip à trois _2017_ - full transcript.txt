THE THREESOME Yeah! Go! Dammit! One, two, three... Lily! Come here! What did I tell you? No, don't come yet! Ow! Mom! I'm sorry, Lily, but there's a knot. You know you'll get it. If anyone deserves a promotion, it's you. Go brush your teeth, sweetie. I've had it with this mess! Darius! Good morning! Ma'am! What are you working on today? - The tile. It won't be easy. - Yeah, you'll have to bend down. You'll get a sore back. I'll go slow. I promise. It's too risky. The barrel prices will kill Alberta and put pressure on tax-shelter securities. I'll call you back. - Hi, Estelle! - Michel! - How are you? - Good. You? Good. Listen, you're doing a great job. You know our clients' finances better than they do. You're a sharp analyst. You have what it takes. Thank you! I've been working so hard to-- That's why I want you to work for Corine Boulay. Corine? You'll be on our top team. Corine is the best. Charlyne! Charlyne! - Business. - Oh my God! But that's not a promotion. I never said "promotion." I said "a new challenge." I have the experience. I make good recommendations. You do! But with Corine, you'll learn to build confidence. You know what I mean? CORINE BOULAY A FLAIR FOR BUSINESS Estelle! We're going to be working together! It's gonna be so... Yeah, Charlyne. It's gonna be so... Esther! - Estelle. - Estelle. Happy? Oh yeah. Super happy. I hope that's not true. Aim higher. You could be a partner like me. - How old are you? - 34. I'm 33. But don't feel bad. These are power poses. They project power. Work on that. No, at home. The secret is to listen to that little voice in your head. Not the big one bossing you around. The little one that knows what to do. The little voice. Not the big voice. - We're going to be the A-team. - I always aim for perfection. You think I'm perfect? The less you worry about perfection, the more authentic you become. And that right there, that's the stuff. Listen to that voice. - How's it going? - Good. You eating at the canteen? I brought a lunch, but that's OK. - What time should I come tonight? - 5:00. Don't be late. Again? I'm sorry. OK. Thanks. Hang up. This is ridiculous! You have to do something. - Absolutely! Come on. - I didn't do anything. - What happened? - It wasn't my fault! I've had it! This is the last time I come get you. You don't solve your problems with violence. I didn't start it, he did! I swear! So? You still shouldn't have done it. You're gonna get hurt! Aunt Marie-Jo said not to let people walk all over me. What? Lily, don't listen to Aunt Marie-Jo. She's a mess. She has no job, no boyfriend, no kids. - She goes from guy to guy. - Like a prostitute? Surprise! Jesus! - Happy birthday, sis! - Thanks. That was nice, what you said about me. I'm sorry. You didn't have to do all this. - It wasn't my idea. - I didn't think so. - Happy birthday, Estelle! - Thanks! - I'm sorry about the mess. - Don't worry about it. My birthday's not for a month. You're so organized, I have to be early to surprise you. If you want to surprise us, why not pay back the money we lent you? Let's not talk money today. Yeah, it hasn't even been five years yet! Happy birthday! It's gonna be a good year, I can feel it. And you smell good. I'm all hot and sweaty. You always smell good. Happy birthday! - Mathieu! - Yes? She just took a dump. - Have you settled on a name? - We're working on it. Ã‰milie, you shouldn't drink if you're breastfeeding. I have to or else she won't sleep. - Estelle? - Yes? Where are your mom's big serving platters? - They're downstairs. I'll get them. - Thanks. - There's no meat? - No, there's no meat. OK. Do you need help? - Is this a group gift? - It's a vagina. It's not her vagina. It's Simon's vagina. Yeah, I thought we said no presents. A DVD! Asian Pussies. I didn't see that one coming. He's cocky! That's not the word I was going to use. I can't believe he puts it in this! You're lucky that's all it is. It's not like he's taking it to dinner. Yeah, but still! Don't freak out! All guys have a porn stash. Mathieu has one. I gave it to him, but still. - You girls OK? Need any help? - We're good! Fucking pervert! Why didn't he tell me? Relax! You don't talk about this stuff. It's like his secret garden. It's normal to have a secret garden. Everyone has a secret garden. I have a secret garden, and it's beautiful. - I don't have a secret garden. - Maybe you should. Am I boring? Am I boring? Oh my God, I'm boring! Of course you're not boring! - Yes, she is. - No, she's not! She's boring! You always have been. You've never taken a single risk. That's because I'm responsible, not boring. "Honey, come to the bedroom! I made you a spreadsheet." Boring. It's pretty practical. Happy birthday! Make a wish. Want me to help clean up? - No, that's OK. - I don't have any plans tonight. Myriam, the taxi's here. Bye! I love you! Thanks. Bye! Thanks! - You sure? - Yes, Myriam. Go! What was that? - We should play poker soon. - Yeah. Let's set it up. Alex said she wants to play too. We could make it strip poker! Very funny! Get out! What do you mean, "she"? Let's go. They're tired. Take this. I'm driving. Bye! Well, that was fun, huh? Yeah. You didn't mention Alex was a girl. It never came up. The Alex you've been giving rides to and playing badminton with? Guy, girl... What's the difference? Do you think I'm boring? What? Where's this coming from? I don't know. I spent the night worried about the mess. And Marie-Pierre... - Not again! Are you serious? - No. I don't know. That was three years ago. It was just a dumb office party thing. And nothing happened! If I was your type, it wouldn't have happened. Stop it. We talked about it. We went to counselling. It was good for you. I mean, it was good for us. You know you're my type, with your itty-bitty titties! They're not that small. One more than the other, I'd say. Wait. So, you're satisfied? I satisfy all your needs? Yes. Why are you asking me this? You don't have a single need I haven't met? Stop. You're perfect. So, everything's perfect? You're funny. I'm going to the basement. I'm so glad you're here. It'll reduce stress if we're two. I'm not great at reducing stress. We're so lucky! Corine is something else. Yeah, we're lucky. It's your job to know! If it's in the paper, then it's too late! What's your source, Reader's Digest? Pack up your stuff and go back to selling printers at Best Buy. Got it? What are you still doing here? Get out! How's it going? My top three would be Charlyne, Caro and Corine, obviously. For me, it would be Maude and the two Sophies, anytime. Corine, Laurence and Catherine. Really, Catherine? She does seem like she'd be kinky. Guys, meeting! - How are you, Estelle? - Fine. Thanks, Catherine. It's coming along! I have my technique. What is it, erosion? - Where's Mom? - She went out with her friends. What are you making for dinner? If you think I don't know how to make Singapore noodle soup with chicken, then you don't know me at all. I'll have the same with two spring rolls. - Anything else with that? - No, that's good. That's good? - I'm invisible. - Come on! You're gorgeous! It's just that you hide it. And your hair... - You've got shy pheromones. - What? You're hot, but you don't have that sex smell. I don't want a sex smell! You just haven't tapped into your fantasies. - I don't think I have fantasies. - What? - You just don't know what they are. - Come on! What do you think about when you're having sex? - The kitchen cabinets, right? - No! The way we express our sexuality says a lot about us. - What do you know about it? - I'm a therapist. Part time. You didn't even finish your night classes. Look who's talking. Estelle, you have to think of your pleasure as a conquest. Your Kilimanjaro is sexual. - My Kilimanjaro is sexual? - Yes. It's true. You have to own your pussy. My boyfriend has no trouble owning his dick. Stop. Guys would jerk off all day if they could. Thanks, Ã‰milie. That helps a lot. Mathieu once rubbed one out between metro stations. So, what do I do? Get yourself a lover. You'll learn something. No. I'm not like you, Marie-Jo. There's a reason you're single. Just go to the Dominican and bang a cabana boy. What would be your biggest challenge? What do you mean? What would it take to loosen you up and allow you to find your place in the universe? Maybe I should have a threesome. I'm officially drunk. I'm talking nonsense. It's never nonsense. - I'm hungry. Let's get poutine. - Yeah! You know what? I'm gonna do it. - Estelle, I love you, but-- - No, Marie-Jo. No. I'm turning 35 and I feel so stuck. I'm sick of it. My job, the kitchen... My daughter keeps getting in fights. I can't sleep. Don't touch me. My boyfriend jerks off, like I don't exist. When does he even have time to do that? If I don't do something, I'm gonna explode. I'm gonna have a goddamn threesome! Got it? Well, Simon will be happy. Not a word to Simon. Ã‰milie, don't tell Mathieu either. - Of course not. - I'm not following. If Simon finds out, he'll think I'm a... You know? I'll do it on my own to loosen up, which will help the two of us. You're gonna have a threesome without your boyfriend for your boyfriend. Exactly. Your logic is crap, but it makes sense. I'll need you guys. I'll be there for you. It won't be easy at first. Like anal. Have you ever tried it? Yes and no. Mom? Mom, I don't want to be late! You can do it. This is exciting! What? Life! Life is beautiful? What'd you do yesterday? - I had a drink wi-- - Not interested. Steel is down 2.6%. Get me the FTSE 100 and the STOXX index. Come on, Esther! That bitch! You're giving yourself a month? If I want to get laid, I can find a guy on Tinder in 15 seconds. You might not want to sleep with those guys, though. Exactly. You're beautiful. You won't have a problem finding people. So, should we place an ad? Yeah! What did you have in mind? She doesn't know. You and two guys? A guy and a girl? Two girls? Three women? Does that count? No. Imagine getting pounded by two big studs. No, I don't see you with two guys. Too much hair. Your baby's crying. You should do something. I don't even notice it anymore. The hardest thing is going to be finding the woman, so... "Woman seeking woman to take lead in an erotic three-way adventure." - That's good! - I know. Picture. - Should I take off my blazer? - No, you're perfect. Three, two... - It's good! - What? Look! That slightly scared look will attract lots of people. - Really? Are you sure? - You look beautiful. - Yeah? - We're keeping it. I don't know why, but I can't stop thinking about sex. I walk by people, and I'm like... That's normal. You turned your libido back on. Use it! Use it? Use it with Simon. Try some new things. Yeah, take it slow. Buy some handcuffs, a whip... I think I'd like handcuffs. Being tied up means agreeing to give the other person control. That's your problem. It's a bit hardcore, huh? I've been peed on before. Fuck! - She's been peed on? - Yeah. - You knew? - Yeah. - When? - At Woodstock en Beauce. - Where's that? - In Beauce. I could live down here, man! I'll rent you my couch. I can't sleep at home. It's hell! I'm always alone with the baby. Ã‰milie's always out. She's never home. Really? Sometimes... I'm scared of her. Buy yourself a gun. - You think? - No! I'm messing with you! I woke up at one point last night, and she was sitting straight up in bed. She was staring into space and saying: "I'm gonna do it. I'm really gonna do it." This morning, she didn't remember it. Don't worry. She probably has the same disease as my contractor. Oh yeah? He says he's gonna do it, but he never does. I'm being serious! Mathieu! I'd go home if I were you! Ã‰milie's really pissed off. She's going to kill me. See you soon! - In heaven! - You're not funny! What's the occasion? Well, our love will soon turn 10. Get undressed. I'll take care of you. Let yourself go. Relax! - Mom? - Just ignore her! Mom? Don't move. In my dream, you had to find me a new school, but no school wanted to take me. That wouldn't happen. Sometimes our minds like to scare us, you know? Did something happen at school? I got into another fight. Lily, did you get violent? What did you do? I just said what I thought, and it turned into a fight. That's no reason to be violent. You can't always say what you think. You'll lose friends. Ow! Shit! Fuck! - Is it red? - I'm sorry! - Is it red? - A little. It's hot! Christ! What's going on, Mom? LoÃ¯c, get in there. Not too badly burned, sweetie? Some people pay for that. It's all right. I'm not perfect either. Do I ever do anything you don't like? No, it's all good. Well, I don't like it when you put your tongue in my ear. You've never complained. No, but I've never liked it. Ever. Alex, get out there! Go get 'em! They're playing rough today. So, is there anything else? Sometimes, I'd like it if you washed it before we... And we always do the same things in the same order. My mind wanders sometimes. But otherwise, it's good. It's amazing! That's great! Lily, go! Number 59 just gave me the finger. - He did? - He has a problem with women. Lily, don't provoke him. You run and try to catch the ball. That's it. What's wrong? - What's up? - Mom doesn't want me to play. - What? - I don't want you to get hurt. - You have to know your limits. - Relax, Mom. It's a game! That's right! Let him have it! Go! You should take your Ritalin, fat-ass! Perfect! That was perfect! Penalty. Offside, Vikings, 59, five yards. THREE BY 3 LOG IN PRINTER: MODEL 4450D (OFFICE) Fuck! - What's up? - I have to go to the office. It's Sunday. You're always working! At least you won't have to have sex with me. I'm sorry about what I said at football. It came out wrong. Corine is stressing me out. Did you print this? Yeah, it's for a friend who doesn't have a colour printer. It's 175 pages. You work on Sunday nights? It's Monday morning in Tokyo. The market opened 20 minutes ago. I like working at night. It's quiet. Your boyfriend doesn't mind? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. There's a reason I've gotten this far at my age. I've earned it. I'm worth over a million and I have no debt. If you want to reach my level, you'll have to put in the hours. Are you strong enough for that? Yes, absolutely. Get out! Ready? 173 replies! JOHANNE 26% POPULARITY - She's your first choice? - She lives in Sainte-Julienne. - Where's that? - I don't know. "I can't go out because of my edema. Passion is my middle name." Pass! Capricorns are good people. There are good people in the burn unit too. I don't want to be the ugly one! It's not about being pretty. It's about being kinky. That's right. I'm not sure I'd actually be able to touch another girl down there. You've never touched a pussy? Other than my own? No. - Does your pussy bother you? - No. Yours is different? You think it's better? A lot of women are ashamed of their vaginas. I haven't trimmed since I gave birth. I literally have an afro. I'm not at my best. I did mine American style. What is that? I don't know anything! What are you doing? Honestly, Marie-Jo! Come on! You need to learn some things. I'm taking you out tonight. - Can I come? - Sure! You need to buy a new dress. Why? Because you can't buy self-confidence. This feels like a costume. - It's hot! - I feel vulnerable. Vulnerability isn't a weakness. It's a strength. - What are you talking about? - Caterpillars become butterflies. A baby giraffe is both fragile and magnificent. Girls, I feel like making out with someone! - With a girl? - Anyone but my boyfriend. - But you love him? - Like crazy! - Just not tonight. - Gotcha! - This place is cool! - It's a hot new club! How do you know about it? Let's just say tonight won't cost much. Estelle, you have to see women as potential partners, as friends. - Get to know them. - That's not it at all! You have to gauge women based on their sexual potential. You're into stats. Should be easy for you. - Watch my bag! - Watch my coat! - And my drink. - Yes. - Seriously! - Yes. This is my song! - Where's my drink? - Over there. Did you know that one of the most common fantasies among women is making love to another woman? Did you know that talking is a common way to avoid doing? I like to be informed. I'm an analyst. Oh yeah? Analyze this! Come on! I'm sorry, she... I have a boyfriend. - So? - I mean, I'm not a lesbian. - Me neither. - Really? These are my friends. They're cool. Hello! I'm Estelle. What's your name? THE CONVENT OF SIN My little sister broke the ice! Sis! I'm just gonna... What? Estelle! GOAL: HAVE A THREESOME 1. FIND A WOMAN 2. FIND A MAN 3. FIND A PLACE 4. HAVE A THREESOME YOUNG WOMAN SEEKING MALE PARTNER FOR A THREESOME MESSAGE SENT HEY, GORGEOUS! I'M UP FOR IT. DO YOU HAVE BIG TITS? SEND ME A PHOTO. What's the matter? I placed an ad online for a threesome. Stop kidding around! Yeah, I'm a real joker! I'm going away this weekend. - A romantic getaway? - No, I'm going with Ã‰milie. You guys are due for a sexy weekend. It'll be good for you. We're not there yet. When she gave birth, she said we wouldn't have sex for 18 months. 18 months? Why not just wait until your daughter starts college? You don't understand. It's postpartum. Runs in the family. After her sister had twins... they had her committed. She just kept on screaming. So, you're lucky, then. You got the normal one. - Did you go out last night? - Yeah. I kissed a girl. - Oh yeah? How was it? - She was so freaking uptight! You know, cute but doesn't own it. A mom trying to find herself. She must be married to some moron. There's no shortage of idiots. No! Your girlfriend's not like that, though. She swings that way, let me tell you. Yeah, we swing that way. Right! If you were hard up, would you sleep with me? No. - I was just joking! - Sure. This came for you. - Is it from a secret admirer? - I doubt it. What is it? Business cards. That's no fun. Yes, officer. I've been very bad. Yes. Suck you off? Yes, I really-- Estelle? What are you doing? Nothing! Hurry up. I've been waiting for 10 minutes. I'm coming. Come on! We're gonna be late. Shit! - I'm sorry! - You're such an idiot. - I've never been so humiliated. - I'm sorry. You'll have to climb smaller hills before you get to Kilimanjaro. Knock it off with that. So? Anyone good reply to your ad? They all look like killers! - So? - Well... What about one of the guys at work? No, not someone I have to see every day. Didn't your osteopath just get separated? Thomas is cute. Yeah! How do I ask him? First, you call him and make an appointment. "How would you like to put that cock in my mouth?" Maybe you're not the right people to ask. By the way, when you look at a man, your eyes have to say: "I'm willing to go far. Really far." Don't make those sad puppy-dog eyes. Watch this. Him. You see that? He looked at my mouth. He wants to sleep with me. - Only because he doesn't know you. - Oh, he's gonna get to know me. Stay on top of your billable hours. Don't wait for the end of the month. It needs to be done daily. Some people here are really diligent about it, like Estelle. Estelle? I'm talking about you. You're a model of efficiency. Thank you. Project 3? What's that? It's a project to improve performance, in threes. Three-person working groups where the third person can settle debates and increase the chances of making informed decisions. I like it! That shows there's no room for improvisation here. In closing, I spoke to Dumais Ventures. They agreed to a trial on the Asian market. If we hit our targets, we get the whole portfolio. So, good luck, Corine Boulay. Have a great day, everyone! Excuse me. What is this? Pull up Dumais' financial profile. The last 10 years. Analyze their diversification and risk management. Unless you have more important things to do. No, not at all. - Estelle? - Yes? You seem a little... What? There's something different about you. She's definitely not helping me shine. - She's tough on me, no? - No. That's just her tone. She's a woman who knows what she wants. And I don't? Project 3... brilliant. I'd like to talk more about it. Really? Sure. - I have to go see someone. - Go on. I'll cover for you. I'd like you to research Kongtech. Be discreet. She just left. She had a doctor's appointment. - Again? - Yeah. So, we're going to work on... Where does it hurt? L1, L2. That's it. Let's take a look. Have a seat. So... - You OK? - Yes. Oh yeah. You're very tense. Lie down on your side, facing me. Stretch out your lower leg. Give me your arm. OK, give me your arm. - You all right? - Yeah. OK, here we go. - On three. - Speaking of three... Do you... Never mind. One, two, three. - OK? - Yes. - Better? - Yes. - That's strange, though. - What? Your sacrum is out of place. I'll have to readjust it. - How do you do that? - From the inside. The inside of what? The inside. The natural passageway. You're going to put your... in my... Yes, but it's a common practice. Nothing to worry about. Hey, Mathieu! What did you mean about Estelle and me? - You know. Don't rub it in. - Stop. You don't know Estelle. You wouldn't guess she was so into sex. We all have a kinky side, Mat. Still, a threesome isn't nothing. - You're playing it pretty cool! - How do you know about it? She says that if she can do this, she can do anything. - She's going to crash and burn! - For sure! Don't tell anyone, OK? If you tell, I'll kill you in your sleep. No, I won't tell. I swear. - You didn't know? - I did! Seriously, don't tell her I told you. I'm just surprised she mentioned it. I told her to be discreet. I have to go. Why didn't you tell me? You didn't want to do it with me? Of course I did! It was a surprise. It was gonna be your present. My birthday's passed. You got me a BBQ kit. No, I mean our tenth anniversary. - Wouldn't you like that? - That's not the issue. It's not us. - Not us, how? - It's not us to do kinky stuff. - Jesus! Who are you? - Really? You're judging me? It's better to jack off into a silicone vagina, right? Or watch this? You like Asian girls? It's not what you think. I found it. I mean, it was a contest. I mean, a gift. It's complicated. Sure! You're no better than I am. I should've told you, but I was afraid you'd judge me. Are you serious? You really want to do this? Yes. It's not that crazy. I'm not asking you to rob a bank. We need to spice things up. But this is big. Doesn't it scare you? Yes. I'm scared you'll fall in love with someone else. I'm scared you'll fall in love too. Wait, are you a lesbian and I just don't know it? If you tell me you're a lesbian... I'm gonna get turned on. - I don't think so. - What do you mean? "I don't think so" isn't super convincing. Well, I don't think so! If we do this, there's gonna be a before and an after. At least we'll have an after. Think about it. You're up? So, I've been thinking about your thing, your project. - Did you sleep? - Not much. If you think it'd be good for us, I'm willing to try it. - Are you sure? - Yes. If it's important to you, it's important to me. I'm prepared to sleep with you and another girl, for you. - Just for me? - Yes. And since I was awake, I thought I'd help out by putting together a list of girls. - Women? - Women, girls... Bianca, 24 years old. These are pictures of girls, women, I found online, whose physical appearance could guide us in our search. That's so nice! All blondes, huh? With big breasts. I hadn't noticed. Is that what you fantasize about when you're with me? - Because I'm the opposite. - Stop! - You're the one who wanted this. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - I'm a bit uncomfortable, I guess. - Me too. Maybe we should take it step by step. BONDAGE KNOT #3 "THE SUBMISSIVE PRINCESS" - Looks about right. - Yeah? I've never been that good at knots. - Is it too tight? - No, it's fine. I wouldn't want you to get gangrene. What do we do now? Now, I want you to pretend to be a German officer, trying to get me to talk. Do I have to be German? I do a better Scottish accent. A sadistic Scottish officer? No. Watch yourself, lassie! I'll smack your wee behind! That doesn't do it at all. Aye, I can be dangerous, bonnie! - OK, untie me. We're done. - No. - Untie me! - I'll untie you when I want! - I'm freaking out. This isn't fun! - Yes, it is! We can't do a twosome, let alone a threesome! What's a threesome? It's a piece of furniture from IKEA. And it's very difficult to put together. - It's adult furniture. - Yeah. Go get ready for football, and I'll make you a nice breakfast. - Dad, why is Mom tied up? - What? Simon? Simon? - Do you have any experience? - A bit. I can show you everything: deep throat, choking, snowballing, spit roasting, face sitting, golden showers, rimming, bukkake, fist fucking... But I won't do anything with animals. It's disrespectful. - No animals? - Right. This isn't gonna work. - Sorry, I really had to go! - Sure! - That's not a problem for you? - No. You're really my type. But I'm four centimetres dilated, so we'd have to do it now. I'm really in the mood. - You're Tatiana? - Yes. You have experience? $500 cash, US. She says you're very pretty and that she won't tell anyone. But how would we... Would you be there when... Yes, I go everywhere with her. But I'll just watch, right? So? Nothing. I tried, but did you see the candidates? Big surprise! You're bailing, the one time you were doing something for you! Sorry I'm not a narcissist like you. I put others before myself. Yeah, and then you never get to yourself at all. - 1-0, Marie-Jo. - You're just like Mom. Go back to the '50s and bake a pie for your man. Where do you get off saying that? I'm always digging you out of some hole. I'd rather have holes than emptiness. - 2-0. - You're heartless. How often did you visit Mom in the hospital? Never. I was there. I always did your homework, your chores. I had no life! - And you still don't! - 3-0. - That's your fault! - 3-1. For once, you were doing something fun and unpredictable! But no, it's too tough! Wake up! Stop scrubbing your counters. Do your clit instead! It'll loosen you up. - 4-1. - Enough. And what has that philosophy gotten you? Nothing! You're 36. You have no job, no boyfriend and no future. You don't have a future either! You work 60-hour weeks at a shit job to pay your shit mortgage, while your husband, Mr. Potato Head, jacks off into a fake vagina! Well, you're... Mrs. Slut! I have a family. You have nothing! Your Kilimanjaro is to become an adult and stop pissing off your sister! Feels good, right? You never would have spoken to me that way 10 days ago. - Thank you, Dr. Slut. - You're welcome. I wish I had a sister to insult. If only she hadn't died... I'm joking! Is this good? No, you lose again! You're really unlucky! What are you doing? Aunt Marie-Jo is teaching me poker. She's really good. - Is that your money? - Yeah. I'll give it back to her! - We're gonna go. - Yes. - Bye, sweetie! - Bye! - Have a good night! - Thanks! - Should we keep playing? - I'm out of money. This bar is the spot to find girls who are willing. Are you serious? I haven't smoked up since college. It's really mild. - You're sure it'll be OK? - Yeah. It's called Tibetan Nightmare. Jesus! - Have you been here before? - Once with Mathieu. Ma'am. Simon! Follow me. - He's got a good memory! - I know! It's your Asian friend! She must be doing this to pay for grad school. The Chinese are good at math. I'll bet she's awesome. We should try to find someone. What about her? RoboCop? I'm down. - I'm kind of nervous! - That's OK. Hi! - Hi! I'm Estelle! - I'm $40. Here. - What's her problem? - Nothing. She's just nervous. We have a question for you. What? Have you ever had a threesome with regular people? Who do you think I am? I have a family. So do I. We have a 9-year-old girl. Really? My son's turning 6. - Do you have a picture? - Of course! - That must have hurt! - Yeah, I tore this much. No, I meant the tattoo. He's handsome. He looks smart. Check it out. When I squeeze my ass, it looks like he's laughing. - It's true! - He's giggling. He's a sweetheart. He never says a word. He's so cute. You should see his little feet! He could stand up at six months. Six months! He's a champ. He's so strong! Well, we're not here to talk about your son. What's his problem? Can't I talk about my son sometimes? - Come on! - Relax, baldy! Don't talk to him that way. I'll talk to him how I want. Can't I get some respect at work? You ever heard of integrity? How about respect? Respect, really? In five minutes, you'll be waving your pussy around. Hey! Don't talk about my cooch that way! I do CrossFit, I drink kombucha and I've won waxing competitions, so don't lecture me! You don't deserve to see my beautiful bongos. Out of my way! ...for all the children who go hungry. Thank you, Cassidy. That's a nice gesture. Any other family projects? Lily? Hi! My name is Lily. At my house, my parents are putting together a threesome. - A what? - A threesome. It's for adults. You must know it. Threesomes are complicated. I think they come from Sweden. - Adults get together to- - OK. Have a seat, Lily. - But I'm not finished. - That's enough. I have a drawing that shows everything. I didn't do anything. Benjamin? Your daughter tried to show the class how to put together a threesome. The things they see online, huh? This isn't the place for that kind of thing. A threesome. Can you imagine? Our daughter is very avant-garde! I don't judge people for their habits. Quite the opposite. My approach to human relationships is based on respect. Respect for everyone's boundaries. I like that approach. We also value openness and respect, like you said. What? Seriously? Do you ever engage in... extracurricular activities? - It's been known to happen. - She's Lily's teacher! - So? - Yeah. So? No. We're going. We'll tell Lily to cool it. Thanks for everything. Keep up the good work! Let's go. Apparently, we're leaving. - What's your problem? - What? We're switching schools. I think she's quite competent. - You think she's pretty? - I didn't notice. - That's a lot of money. - Yep! It's almost even. - You think so? - Yeah. - What's this? - It's a pool for your threesome. I bet $25 that you won't do it. - So everyone here knows? - Yeah! Forget it. I'm not doing it. SIMON'S THREESOME POOL - What? - It's my business! No, you're doing it. Not for you. For me. For everyone here. Look, a threesome is more complicated than it sounds. It's hard to find a girl who's willing. What? It's harder to find a girl who hasn't done one. Oh yeah? You want to do it? No. I bet $25 that you wouldn't. I know who can help you. Bruno, Simon. Hi! The $20. This is so stupid! What I'm about to tell you is a secret. There's a place that not many people know about. It's like a little castle hidden in a bungalow. It doesn't look like much, to avoid unwanted attention. But as soon as you walk in, as soon as you open that door, you enter another world. On your left, there's a white grand piano. And on that piano, Garou, the singer, is just kicking back. What? Garou, man! - Yeah. He's always there! - Really? He needs to move those fingers. I've never seen such sensual women. Marshmallow breasts... velvet ass cheeks... You're in for a beautiful night. - And Garou is always there. - Maybe that's why his throat hurts! Everybody wears masks so it's totally anonymous. So it might not be Garou, but whatever! It's in a basement in Montreal North. I hear it's very tasteful. "Basement in Montreal North" and "tasteful" don't belong in the same sentence. It's OK. I trust you. Recalculating route. Turn right in 10 metres. Turn right. Recalculating route. - How are you feeling? - A little nervous! Continue for one kilometre. What will you think of me after? That you're kinky, but with good values. Turn left in 10 metres. - Turn left. - You sure you can handle two women? - Turn left... - Shut up! Not you, her. Yeah, I think I can handle two women. You have arrived. Your destination is on the right. Quite the castle, huh? We go in, we find a woman, we get her phone number and... ...we get the hell out. 15 minutes max. We're crazy, aren't we? - I have to pee! - OK, let's go. Nice place! - You must be Estelle and Simon. - Hello! Hello! Sophie, Garou. It's GrÃ©goire, but everyone says I look like Garou. See you downstairs? Here you go! Sorry, it's the only one left. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Shoes. We try to keep it clean. With all the people coming and going, it's not easy. I put it on? Watch your head! - Nice! - It really is! - Can I get you a drink? - No, we're not thirsty. It'll help you relax. We're gonna have fun tonight! Two glasses, Sylvain. - Here. - Thank you. That won't work! - It's got a kick! - Yeah, a little. For this to work, you have to mingle. Sorry, this was a bad idea. Let's go. No. We said 15 minutes. - You sure? - Yes. Sorry, Monique. Not tonight. Poor-man's Garou is coming over. I feel like dancing. - You're so tense! - Not really. - You must have nice little tits. - No. I want you to kiss my husband! I can't wait to blow your boyfriend! - Come on, touch me! - No! - Let's go! - Come on! Jesus! It's like a '70s porno down there. It's a prefab nightmare. Jesus Christ! - What are you doing? - I really had to go. I feel like throwing up. What are we doing in a basement in Montreal North? Could we sink any lower? We were fine before! Don't you think our life is boring? Or that I'm boring? I like that you're boring! What does that mean? We've been so busy, ever since Lily was born. We never have time for us. - I don't know. I'm tired. - You're not tired. You're fed up. Fed up with the routine: lunches, garbage, recycling... They don't even take cardboard boxes if they're not in the bin anymore! They're just regular people who are brave enough to shake things up. What the... - Suck him off! - Those fuck-ups! - Oh yeah! - Fucking sickos! Come on! - Are they following us? - I don't know. Run! Don't go. Be cool! We were just getting warmed up. - No! - We're good! - You forgot your shoes! - That's OK! - OK, Lily. We're here! - Bye, Mom! Hey, canteen! Bruno, I'm talking to you! Garou will be there, my ass! Did Garou fall down on his face? Did he get run over by a bulldozer? I looked like a fucking idiot! Dumb-ass! Estelle, buy $25 million worth of class A shares in Kongtech. $25 million? Isn't that a lot? I mean, Kongtech is speculative. Change it, then. Now it's a strong buy. Based on what? My little voice. Go on! I'm not sure-- What? You can't write $25 million? 2-5... Estelle? Do you think she has insider information? I don't know, but it doesn't make sense. - You know she hears a little voice? - Yeah. - She has a big and little voice. - I know. She might be schizophrenic. What are you doing? Are you nuts? Now's not the time. Estelle, I'm at work, and I've found the woman of your dreams! I'm not sure I can do it now. Sex isn't something you do. It's a journey. It's a destination. What are you talking about? She's from London. She's just passing through, and she's into it! Really into it! TRANSACTION COMPLETED Hi, Estelle! Hi! Scarlett and I met at a conference. She studies sexual dysfunction, specializing in the clitoris. - That's narrow! - Depends on the woman. Scarlett doesn't speak much French and doesn't understand it, either. Are you comfortable with that? Do you do this often? I don't mean that it's your job, that you're a prostitute- I'm like a scared little puppy! - So we have to do this now! - Exactly. Come on! - That's my girlfriend. - Really? - What's she doing here? - Beats me! - What are you doing here? - I have to talk to you. Alex, Estelle. Hi! - What's up? - Well... I'll go. This is it. You're still on this? I thought we were done with it. Why? I never said that. I found a woman who's willing. She's perfect. She's waiting. - Tonight's the night! Let's go! - No. - No, what? - Not tonight. - It's now or never. - I don't think so. You don't want to anymore? To be honest, I was sure you'd bail. I was into it at first, but not now. It can't be good for us. You're my husband. You're supposed to support my projects. Redoing the kitchen is a project. This is just messed up. Look, I've always sacrificed myself for others. I'm finally doing something for me. This is my challenge. Your challenge? I thought it was for our 10th anniversary. Well, I'm doing it for me, and for us. The thought of us and another woman doesn't even turn me on! Even in my dreams, it goes badly and I get mad! If you don't do it, I'll do it with another man. Go ahead. I had my screw-up, you have yours. We'll be even. - No, this isn't about revenge. - Stop. Do it. Seriously. But I never want to hear about it again, OK? Never. I hope that after it's done... you'll be happy, with me. Do you have an answer? The interest expenses... - Mom? - Yes? - Are you and Dad getting separated? - No. Of course not! - Darius, are you married? - Yes, for 42 years. - Where's your wife? - In Bucharest. That must help avoid fights. - You think? - Yes. Let's go. COME TO THE OFFICE. NOW! Car! If you wanted to ruin Dumais Ventures, then well done. Let's not jump to conclusions. The market will evolve and it will allow us to... Oh yeah? The company is under trusteeship and the funds are already blocked. I lost $10 million in one day. Tell me how, exactly, this is all going to fix itself! Is that your eighth sense? - You think this is funny? - No. Are you working on something else? Project 3, maybe? Why don't you tell them about it? Project 3 is a pilot project that uses three-person groups to make important decisions. It didn't stop you from ruining us! What do you think of Project 3? You heard me. What do you think? - Is that your style? - No. Because I can get you out of this. I'm asking you a favour. You understand? Go on. I'm in. Charlyne, stay with us. Right there is perfect. Yes. Mr. Dumais, Project 3 worked perfectly. As you know, Corine wanted to invest $25 million in Kongtech. But her Project 3 committee, made up of Charlyne and myself, reversed that decision. We invested $1. To cover your losses. I don't know. I'd rather keep our relationship professional. Thomas, the day you put your finger in my ass to adjust my sacrum, I think we crossed that line. If you swear there's no spark between you and me, I'll back off. - But you have to swear it. - I swear. Liar. God... I don't know what you're imagining, but I'm not up to this. - You'll be fine. - No, I won't be fine. Just breathe. That's the thing. I feel like I can't breathe. - I'm going home. - No, please stay. I think I'm ready. Thank you for agreeing to take part in this. It will surely be an important event in my life. I haven't had sex in two years! Go ahead! I'll jump in. Three, two, one... My turn! - Esther? - Estelle. I know. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. You shut your mouth! THREE BY 3 SIGN UP NOW Stop arguing with me. There are four! You're right! Mom! - Hi, sweetie! How's it going? - I love you! Can we talk? What are we doing up here? - You don't remember? - Remember what? Babe! - Your parents' roof? - Yes. The only place we could be alone. - Our first time. - Yeah. Listen... I know I didn't pay enough attention to you. I let myself go. But I'm gonna get back into shape. It's not that! You're handsome. I don't want you to change. We're good together. I wanted to prove something to myself. You're beautiful. I miss you. I miss the two of us. I miss the three of us. I even miss Darius sometimes! I love you so much. You know it's been 10 years today? You're right! - I want you. - Oh yeah? Lie down. - Are you nuts? - No! You want to do it here? - You're crazy! - I am not! That's good! Don't come yet!
