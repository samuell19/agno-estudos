Written & directed by JARMO LAMPELA Ippe. I'm taking Sami home. -What? I'm taking Sami home. I'm taking Sami home. You deal with Kalle. FREAKIN' BEAUTIFUL WORLD Ippe! Kalle's looking for you. -Kalle. Fuck. Rave on Friday at the factory. Fuckin' kid. Never come here alone. -Stop that. Papu'll beat the shit out of you. -I'm with him. The fuck you are. Go home. Papu brought mother home in a taxi last night. Hey, Sami. It's gonna be OK. Where's Papu? - I don't know. The old place. Didn't want to meet some guy called Kalle. -Shit. Go home now. We'll be there soon. |I don't want to go alone. -What? You won't be staying here! Go to my place. -I'll either stay here or come with you. Sami. Come here. Wait here a sec. Hi, Mia. Good to see you. -Hi. When did you come? -I've been here for some time. From Copenhagen? Forget it. Could you do me a favour? -OK. Fuck. My nail's broken. Remember Papu's kid brother? I want you to take him home. Hey, that guy Kalle - wanted to see you, or Chip and Dale he said. He told me to tell you if I saw you. Mia'll take you home. -1 can't let her in. Papu's told me not to. -Told you not to? Can you hear me? Will you help? -Sure. What do you want? Take Sami to my place. Here's the keys. What? -Remember me? Give me a hand, Sami. If I help you now you can do me a favour later. OK. What do you want? -I'll tell you later. Will you be long? I can't hold out too long. Don't think so. You borrowed my Game Boy. Why didn't you return it? I guess I forgot. What's eating you? Never make me wait for you. That's fucking with me. In a really heavy way if you fail to show up. Especially when your debts are due. Didn't you get your money? -What do you think? I want my investments to bring me more than just headaches. You'll get it. - I hope so. My place, nine o'clock tonight. And if I don't see you... Remember. Check out what I bought. High tech, we go digital. 28 x zoom, no vibration. -Kalle says hi. Get me some band-aid. -Shit. What does he think he is, a surgeon? Are you out of your mind? -What did I do? You bought the camcorder. The money was for Kalle. We need proper tools. We'll give him the old one, a ThinkPad and two mobile phones. If that won't make him happy he's a nutcase. And who blew this job? You were too fucked up to talk. Your honey's back from Copenhagen. My what? -Mia. Since when did that cleptomaniac become my honey? I asked her to take Sami to my place. -Why? You'd fucking leave him anywhere. He's got to learn to take care of himself. I can't change his nappies every time our mum forgets. Mother was in a bad shape. She went to wash the rugs and had a couple of beers. Now she'll be drinking for a week again. I've got to put a notice on the salon door: Go and get your fucking hair done somewhere else, you cows! What a fucking great colour! Wish it was always like this. Would be a freakin' beautiful world. I must go to the country to see dad. -Where's that? In Lempaala. Where the hell's that? Right after Valkeakoski and before Tampere. Should've known. How about that jerk? -That one? He's the size of a planet. -A sweet old lady then for you. Shout a bit louder, can't you? When are you off to the backwoods? -This weekend. Dad's got a gig here. He'll give me a lift. I promised to paint the band's bus. You coming? -We'll see. Cash card. -No Visa? What? -Well, that's all we have. I'm terribly sorry, it was my fault. Those things are dangerous. -Well, we were lucky. I might have got hurt. Where are my sneakers? -Where did you leave them? Where did you leave them? -They were right under your nose. Well I couldn't take them. Go and get them. Back off and let me work. And I will get your stinking sneakers for you. -That's right. Nine nine eight two. Five grand. Fucking Carl Lewis, come back! What took you so long? - I got your fucking sneakers. What do you say? -You were fucking lucky. What's the matter? You think the cops are coming to check if the shoes fit you? Too many Cinderellas. -Why run then? Jerk! I thought the shop detectives were chasing you. I wanted to check out the pulse meter. 126. Now you can give it to Kalle. He's always drooling after those. I fucking bought this, he won't get it. I'm so out of shape I'll start training again. Cool. -Fucking fakes. Everything OK? -Mia's asleep. Hallo! Wake up! Not good, not good at all. What did she take? -The bottle's under her coat. Mother's sleeping pills. How many did she take? -Two or three. Ought we to pump her stomach? Mother always takes two pills when she gets a day off. Then she sleeps for 16 hours. -Your mum's in a heavier league. She won't wake up until the day after tomorrow. What're you doing? -What do you think? Taking her clothes off and tucking her in. Take her blouse off. You pervert! Getting a hard-on? The shirt's all she's got. -You're a weird one. Tits won't bite you. You've seen tits before. Not this close, in fact. Ismo. You have no need for your low self-esteem. Few young people of your age have had sexual experiences. Look at that! A tattoo! Look at those. Love from Copenhagen. You know - it'd be wise to stick to grass. I've got it under control. |I don't need to shoot up. Can't even afford it. -No more sweet old ladies. We've got the money Kalle wants. We won't give him cash. -Give him your ass if you want. I want the account settled. And I want to see the end of him. OK. But don't come crying when he tries to cheat us. I'll bring your stuff if mother's not at home. Camilla wants you to call her first. -You know what? She just learned to like surprises. We'll just take care of one thing first. - I don't want to be here alone. You don't have to. Ippe will baby-sit you. Thank you for what we are about to receive amen. No one here. -Not my fucking fault. I'll come with you. -You do what I say. Tell people you're in training for the fucking Helsinki Cup. Where are you going? -None of your business. We can't leave him here. It's nearly 9 o'clock. Go to the kiosk if you get bored. Aunty Ippe gave you pocket- money. What do you say? Thanks. Any games in there? Gabo. Gabo. Don't give him any. -Won't your asshole master let you eat chocolate? It's bad for his kidneys. Fucking comedy show. Look at that. OK by me. Nothing bugs me more than business by barter. How much cash you want? -Let's see now. A grand for the camcorder. Two for the laptop, one for the phones. That's four. The camcorder's worth more than ten! I paid four for it this morning. You can keep it. You keep all this stuff and sell it. Maybe you get more than four, maybe not. That's your problem. Give me 20 grand and we're even. Or I'll take 40 next week. Twenty grand? -That's my investment in you. As we're terminating our business relationship, I want my money. You've taken stuff since March, always a grand's worth of samples. No one said we'd have to pay for it ourselves. You were supposed to use it to get yourself customers. How many do you have? Thirty? Forty? Somehow I get the feeling you've used all of it yourselves. You've fucking used it yourselves. What is it you don't understand? Three. Two. When do you want the rest? -Did I hear right? Chip and Dale want part payment. How about renegotiating your loan? - I think that's the best solution. You want to eat your teeth? What can you do for me? I'm not wasting any more of my time on you clowns. We could take a shipment in for you. -What shipment? You two couldn't handle it, you're too fucked up. We'll go to Stockholm for you. Ippe's mother works on the ferry. -What's she got to do with this? She gets him free tickets. They've never checked him. Dare to try it? Gabo, place. How about it? -I'll get the tickets. Great to be that fucking jerk's slave. -One job. We'll do it. Big deal. Big deal your ass. Of course we do it, we fucking have to do it. Relax. -You want this? I can't take it, I'm your bodyguard. Where the fuck is he? -Was he supposed to sit there? Here's your money. -Keep it. Sorry we're late. Are you cold or something? -No. Look what I did. This spade's a dinosaur and this is a flying lizard. The lizard lands to feed and the dino tries to grab it. When he's right close the lizard takes off. He's a mean flyer. Get your backpack and we'll go. -Now the lizard... I'll come with you. What the fuck for? What will you be when you grow up? What do you mean? -Just a thought. Haven't bothered to think. Something, I guess. No, I know. Nothing. -Right. That's what you are already. Sami. Take these. In case things start to bug you or something. Call me, I'll leave the machine on. You haven't seen dad for a long time. -Some other time. I'lll make sure you get in. I'll let you know when mother's OK. Papu? -Yes? I'll miss you. -Me too. Take care. Pauli? Come here and talk for a moment. -Go and talk for a moment. Shut the fuck up. Pauli. I want to talk to you for a moment. Move over. -Pauli. Why didn't you go? -Cut it. Pauli. When did you last see your father? Call me Pauli one fucking more time and you'll get hurt. You'll lose all contact with your family soon. Didn't you understand? -You should open up, Pauli. There's fucking contact for you. I told you to stop. Get up, people are coming. Don't play games with me. Ippe. Say something. What's the matter? -Are you OK? How come we're here? The first aid clinic's open. Relax. -0K. It was my fault, I started it. I think I'll keep a low profile for a couple of days. Stay home and watch the TV. Not a bad idea. I'll see to the rugs - and see if mother comes home. I'll come and see you're alive. And make sure you kick that speed whore out. -Right. Ippe? You awake? -Yes. I'm going back to the ferry. Who's she, by the way? -Mia. This is not a hotel, remember? -She missed her last bus. What's this? -This? A Freetime. A bleeper. If someone calls me - it shows me the number or the message, or both. Where did you get this? They are expensive. And why? It's not mine. Do I have to explain? -Yes. The sooner I get rid of it the better. My dealer gave it to me so he can reach me anytime. Finally. I was afraid you were getting sick. I'll leave you some money, go and pay the bills. A modem would save us the trip to the bank. I believe the bill's been paid when I see the receipt. Can you get me a cabin for Sunday? Papu wants to go shopping. Aren't you going to Lempaala? -Something came up, dad said. Ippe. Do I have a fucking label saying shake before using on me? Stop that and let me sleep. I've got a blazing headache. Are you going? -No, I just woke up. You were fucking lucky. -What do you mean? To wake up at all. - I knew I would. I know the dosages better than the doctors do. We came to get my things. -Why are you down here then? Dad wanted to go up alone. -of course. He said you can come with us if you want. Don't you know how to use a phone? You've got no fucking business here. Where is your mother? I guess she's at work at this hour. -Didn't seem to be. Then she's somewhere. What if we hadn't been at home yesterday? -So fucking what? Everything'd be just like before. Leave Sami here if you're busy. Sami moves in with us. For good. -What the fuck do you mean? You can decide whether you stay or come. I'm filing for the custodianship over both of you. You're not doing that to mother. -1 already called my lawyer. I won't be staying with you. -I can't force you to. But think sensibly now. This can't go on. I know exactly what's fucking best for me! If you fucker think I'm going to tell mother for you you're mistaken! The keys. -We'll still need these. Tell your mother to call me. Your souvenirs from Copenhagen scared the hell out of me. On your arm. |I don't shoot up any more. Last night was the first lapse. That's why I wanted the deal. Now's your turn to help. OK, ask me anything. But nothing to do with stuff. You sure? Anything else? -Just fucking anything. At least I'll try. I've been staying at my brother's. But it doesn't work out. Their kid's too restless, I can't get any sleep. You tried to see your folks? I was supposed to see mother at work yesterday - but I chickened out. I thought I'd try again today. This is you know who's you know what. When you hear you know what leave me a you know what - or you'll later know you know what. Pick up the phone! Try to wake up! This is you know who. This's the first time someone introduces me to her mother. I don't think your mother will want to see me. All she wants to see is the silverware I lost. Papu - Salon - 627627 Mia, your mother-daughter relationship is not very trusting. We must ask your mother a question of conscience. Does she really set material values above working human relationships? Minister Haavisto is at a Cabinet meeting. What do these guys do here? -What? Besides fax papers to each other. -You can ask my mother that. If we see her this century. We were supposed to meet yesterday. I spent the night at Ippe"s place. Nothing happened. -No? Kari was out all night looking for you, checking hospitals - showing your photo at the station, trying to find you - before you do something stupid. Is that nothing? Yeah but still nothing happened. -of course not. I can see that. Really mother, nothing awful has happened. I've got something to tell you. Let's go out for a coffee. I can't, and I don't want. I'm too busy now. There's a kiosk outside. It won't take long. -I said no. And no use asking for money, I won't give you any. I don't have any to give. I don't want your money, I just want to talk... I must read a committee report on environmental household waste. I might even learn something. Besides how to have locks changed. I just want to come back home. -Mia darling. Your were so sure you would like living at Kari's place. And now you don't. We don't want to start the same circus again. Believe me, nothing happened. -You look awful. Sit down there and wait. I called Kari, he'll pick you up. What the fuck? Tell me what's so special there? |I don't know. I don't want to spend another day at my brother's place. Where you going? -No idea. Any suggestions? Want to go and see the Wasa? -What's that? An old ship, a museum. In Stockholm. Want to come along? -When will you go? Sunday, I guess. -That's a long time ahead. You can stay at my place. -It's not a hotel. How's things? -Fine as can be. Want anything? My treat. -1 already ordered. Can I tell you something, as a friend? You look tired, try to cheer up. Need any money? There's a job for you if you like a couple of days' sailing. Think about it. Full board, and the boat's no dinghy either. And some sweet men for company. -Three neat businessmen. Four thousand, you'll get half of it now. -Not for four. One will cry and say he's got a daughter of my age. Another tries to poke his dick into any hole he can find - the third one can't get a hard-on but likes to slap your ass. No fucking thanks, not for forty thousand. Think about your future. If you're really, really lucky - you'll get a job selling burgers somewhere. I'll give you two months' earnings for two days. Put your dog on the job. You save the money - and the potbellies will get some variety. Gabo's a he. -Put a dress on him. The drunk assholes won't know if they fucked a dead pigeon. What's wrong with her? -Nothing. I see. For God's sake. I'm so happy you've found each other. Only in life. Here's one hundred marks. Open a home savings account. You're seeing things. Up yours with your account. That's more like it. Where's Chip? I thought I was supposed to take care of this? -Well have you? Sunday ferry, back on Tuesday morning. All right? -0K. You can still say no. I can't help you if anything happens. I'll be studying marine biology with you two as my assistants. Leave the bleeper and take the magazine. Cut that out. -Why did you lie to me? What do you mean? -What do you mean? 'Want to go and see the Wasa?' Fuck you. -That's what I'm doing. You just said you'll be bringing Kalle a sample load of LSD. I'm sorry. I've got no choice. It's got nothing to do with you. It's OK if you don't want to come. That's your headache. Answer it! Ippe's and his mum's place, I'm Mia. I'm his friend. No, just a friend. Who are you? It's your dad. -Tell him to call back later. Ippe's in the toilet. When and where? -Lintsi, at six. It's Papu. How's your head? -It's OK. What you been up to? -Nothing special. Moved into the salon. I'll take some nozzles. I talked to Kalle. Two days and then we go. On the Sunday ferry. Check this out. Let's spend it all. Kalle deserves a fucking lesson. His fucking prices are pre-EU. Just joking. I'll be painting the Meritulli car park. I could do with some help. -We're going to meet dad. Really? Say hi to him for me. Want to go to the rave? -I'll work on my headache. Right. Couldn't get her out or didn't you want to? I promised to help her stay straight. She only sleeps there. A fruit leading a whore. Remember to check her pockets. Surprise, surprise: knives, forks, the VCR, a bleeding bookshelf. Or valuable pages from the papers. -Right. Up yours, too. I'm feeling fucking lousy. No roller-coaster rides for me. A hangover? -No, concussion. Really? What happened? Fell over with the skates, banged my head. But take Mia along. You're not scared of that. It's not about being scared, it's the direction of the motion. And who was number two at bungee-jumping after Papu? I'm off speed events. -Right, I forgot. Speed events. I don't go for bungee jumping any more, it's too weird. You fall from high and get down before you notice. And you can't get back on your feet without help. And the bass drum. Will this take long? -Not long now. You've been saying that for an hour now. You want a hit? Close the fucking door then. You and Ippe got the same hobby. -What's that? Go and have a sniff. Let's go. I want to listen. - I don't, not to anything any more. Your dad's gonna buy us dinner. -I'm not hungry any more. Sorry, but I am. Eating at that speed you won't taste anything. Food is fuel. A hot dinner must be eaten hot. I won't roll a potato around, admiring how well-cooked it is. I can't get no satisfaction chewing on a carrot forever. I'm a fuck in fast food eater. Very fucking fast. Do you go bungee jumping? -What? Do you use it a lot? -Food, you mean? All I eat, of course. Grass or whatever you call it. -Come on. I tried it once. Empty your pockets on the table. -The fuck I will. Who the fuck do you think you are? -Where do you get the money? Go join the Police Academy. -Are you dealing or stealing? You eaten? Let's go. Too much shit at this table. You're in trouble but you tell me how deep. You're coming with me. Let's see what we can do. You know what? You're late. Stop playing dad, it's not you. Try to get a move on. - I don't want to wander around. Or are we going somewhere? - I told you: the factory. Papu must be there. Let's see if it's any fun. I won't walk another metre. Gonna stay there? -Yes. What's so special about this place? I'll give you the keys, go and watch the washing machine. I'll come when I come. Did the rave tire the little baby out? Can I ask you one thing? You want to smoke some? I don't care. That's the last thing. -What then? I don't want to hurt you. Did you have to turn tricks to get money? You got a cig? You can have the whole carton. Mother's treat. One's enough. I'll smoke it and go. Please don't. There's no hurry. Good. And another thing. You can touch. Is it Sunday already? -Friday. I mean yesterday. So today's Saturday. I think. Why? No, it's fucking Sunday. I need an alarm clock. |I don't feel like fucking smiling. What's the time? Two minutes later than just now. -What was it then? A minute later than before. Use your own watch. I'll ruin that fucker's face. Pull your clothes on. I'm whacked. -What day is it? When you party for 30 hours - you feel like you haven't slept for a week. My heart's pounding away like mad. Do you clown know that our ship's just about gone? Why can't you tell me? -Sunday. And it's five p.m. I must go to the kiosk. I'm an hour late already. See you. I'll come by and rob you some day. Coming or not? You do it with Mia, I'm no good as a bodyguard. Just make sure you keep the money, don't trust that cleptomaniac. Who the fuck else can I trust? See you. OK. I'll come. But I need a shower first. Can't fucking see Mia. Tell me it's these shades. Fucking jerk. Why didn't you give the money to the Salvation Army? Maybe she's inside. -Right, and aunty's got balls. I've sometimes thought I'll never see thirty. But I never thought I'd only see half of it. Keep moving, stay awake. We won't get him aboard. -Sure we will. Stay sharp. I'm tired, get it? I'm going. Get him aboard. You're tired now but it'll pass. -Shut the fuck up, you whore. Try to get a move on. -Shut up, speed whore. We've got lots of time. Take off your clothes, you can go to sleep. All I do is change clothes. -Want me to help you? You're fucking mad. -Keep your hands off me! Relax, man. -What the fuck are you trying to do? Touch me one more time and I'll kick your nose in. Relax now. -Mia, stop it. I won't touch you again. Fucking relax now! - I am relaxed! OK. You know that hurts. You want me to stop? -Yeah, and right now. I know when I'm not wanted. See you fucking later. Are you 0K? What about you? Fucking nutcase. You know what? Dad's got a lawyer trying to get me and Sami away from mother. Can we meet somewhere? I'm just going to take a shower. Come to the mess. Dad said hi. I took him to Lintsi when they had a gig in the town. Anything else happened? -Nothing special. Nothing that'd interest you. -Come on, tell me. I'm always interested in your affairs. Well, I don't know. It's a long story. Nothing bugs me more than a guy who says he'll tell me a story. 'No, I won't. Or I'll tell you later.' If it's a long story, make it short. -0K. Short. My dealer Kalle knifed me. Papu and me rolled a sweet old lady. Papu's mum started to drink and we took Sami to his dad. Mia is an ex-junkie, she's also in on this. Dad caught me smoking grass - and Papu got burned out from too much speed. He knocked me out one night and I got concussed. Now we're bringing back drugs from Stockholm - So We can pay our debts to our dealer. Ippe'd make a wonderful writer, wouldn't he? Did I understand correctly: Mia's your girl? Can the mother meet the potential daughter-in-law? 132. -Fuck, no! 132. Tell him to switch to a lighter sport. |I got to meet mother again. Want to come? It's the first time someone wants to introduce me to his mother. She may not want to meet me. -She does. And she knows all about you. I told her you're an ex-junkie and all that. Mother, Mia. Mia, mother. The name's Tarja. I'll tell you one thing straight away. I'm not suggesting anything but if you do something nice - together besides seeing the Wasa, remember contraception. He's a Swede. He doesn't understand anything. That concludes mother-in-law's sermon. What will it be? Should I have warned you? -You like your mum? What kind of a question is that? I fucking love my mum. I like her. She'll never change any of your locks. Were we supposed to go somewhere? What's the time? -Quarter to twelve. Quarter to which time? The minutes are the same in Naples and Nepal. Is it 12 o'clock Swedish time? Quarter to. But we could be in Oslo for all I know. Get your ass up, Mia. -Which one's which? I've forgotten. What do you mean? -Which one's long and which one's short? I'm fucking sorry, guys. It's only nine. Fucking funny. - I think so too. Fucking hilarious. - I think so too. It's great we agree on something. I've got to get some money. -Get some for me, too. Would be cool to be in some fucking metropolis. Was Copenhagen 0K? Just say yes or no. Depends on what you do there. For me, it was a nightmare. Sweetie, just wait till you lie in bed with no junk, no nothing - wishing you could die. -You make me cry. Darling, you're sailing too fast. Weld the bow gates shut. You just worry about your own bow gates. Down the street, the café, on the third street on the left. Let's go to Copenhagen, the whole gang. Right, Papu? What gang? Who'd take you along? We don't need a guide dog. -The fuck you're saying? Low blood sugar? We got exactly one option. Ismo. Give me some money. I've got to buy Sami something. I don't have much myself, Pauli. - I don't have any. What? You had many grand. Nothing to laugh about. Everything costs nowadays. Thanks. We should do something about our finances. Pay a visit some night to that accounting agency we got cased out. Marco. Hi. You'll find the interesting article on the middle pages. If I remember right. -0K, thanks. I hope the trip back home goes well. -Thanks, so do I. Good luck. -Bye. Fucking Marco. So fucking simple it's beautiful. You think we should check the articles in this one? If I take a dive I don't need no weights around my ankles. How about forgetting the ship? You've seen it a thousand times. It's that building there. See? Only 500 metres. And I promise it's an experience. The whole thing's so fucking sick. Think about it: people stood about here watching. 'Hey, the fucking ship's sinking.' -Let's go somewhere else. You mean to see if Silvia and Charles are home? -or Greta. Greta who? -Margarethe, Queen of Denmark. Copenhagen's just as good an option for me as a backwoods burger stand. OK. Put some fucking flowers on my grave. You'd never let me get far. This Admiral Fleming made thirty men - run across the deck. And the ship almost capsized. But no one had the nerve to tell the king - to try to draw something else than ships. You know, if you ever want a job you could be a guide here. That's all I'm good for? -No, really. You'd be a good guide. I couldn't explain things to idiots. -You do that all the time. Hi there. New shades again. Let me try them. Hallo! Someone turn the lights back on! But outside, they work. Go and check the truth, Ruth. Freakin' beautiful. -Let me try them. How much do you want for these? I should've brought everyone a pair. I love that city. I got this Game Boy - for a carry-out price. You're sick. You're totally sick. I'm afraid to let you out of the cabin. What would you've got with those coupons of yours? Muffins? Let's go on the deck. -OK. Coming? I'll stay here and play this. Thanks for the shades. -It's nothing. Friends deserve something more than just a pat on the head. I used your coupons for the only greens you both like. Come and look at the moon tonight. -Fuck you. Who's gonna be the mule? - I can be. We can draw lots. -I can be. I haven't done anything yet. Heads, I'll do it, tails, you. I'll do it. -Show me. At least I tried. Need a light? That's for both of us. You could've told me. Go and sleep. I'll come when I come. The limit's 80/110. Anything over that and it beeps. I'm not wearing this. -Won't do you no harm. At least you can see if you can keep cool. You two go first. Mia, I'll give you the keys. Go straight to my place. If I don't come wash the dishes, hoover the place and get the hell out. Mother comes the day after tomorrow. It's nice if the place is clean. If I really don't come clean out the stash. And you Chip break the sad news to Kalle. I could go now. Or is there anything else? -What's the hurry? Wait for the crowd to go. -I like crowds. What's the matter? -Nothing. Why? Why so tense? -What do you mean? Stop that! You're like Sakke before a gig. The Customs makes me nervous. They may find my load of drugs. Not funny. There's nothing in there. Well then I can look. What's this? -A joke. Dad asked me to bring him something and I thought - perhaps he'd like to brush up his English. Since when is he interested in diving? -Since yesterday. I could take him one of your Absolute. -Give him this first. Cheers! Your squeeze has gone. -This's a good gadget. You stayed cool. -I'm here, aren't I? It showed a hundred the whole time. You're a fucking hour late. Five more minutes and we'd've been gone. -Really? For that Chip'll buy us breakfast. What do you want? I've eaten two already. Let's settle this so we can go. I'll have a café au lait, and two croissants. How about getting down to business? -All right. I don't believe a bill's been paid until I see the receipt. When could you do another job? You'll net ten thousand for it. Piss in your fucking pants, man. -Fucking faggot. We'll do nothing for you. -Who asked you anything? Remember this? Feel free to shop me anytime. -Really? 1 could give a copy to your mum. -OK. Want the address? Ducksburg phone book, C. Chip Chipmunk. -Dale. Dale Chipmunk. 5, Nut Lane. -Your mother's name is Tarja. 3 B 11 Admiral Street. Telephone 6362185. Or I could send a copy of the cassette to her aboard the ship. I'll be in touch. Come to the salon. -What for? I got something you may find interesting. What do you think? How much will Kalle pay for this? I thought I'd cover our backs. Fucking idiot. I won't be the one explaining this to Kalle. He'll be a quiet boy soon. -We weren't doing it for him. We don't have to fear him. -See this? It's nothing compared to what's coming. Fuck. Kalle's portable. It's for you. Relax. I'll handle this. -And I'm getting out of town. Open up. What took you so long? I hoovered your grass. I was sure you got caught. Worse. -What? Better that you know nothing. Fill this up with clean clothes. And fast. You go to see your mother. So this is goodbye. -This is goodbye. If she makes you go on your knees, you go. Or crawl, you crawl. If she wants you to wear a dress and learn to curtsy, you do it. Or go to your brother's place, but you must go right now. I guess we won't be seeing each other for a long time. -If ever. You going somewhere? Place! You gave me an empty magazine. - I don't have them. Where are they? - It was empty when I got it. What did you say about the magazine? -Papu's got it. Let me call him, he's got your bleeper. Why didn't you go? -Something came up. Chip. You want to say goodbye to Dale - before he bleeds dry? If Dale bleeds dry you know who'll be the next? -You will. And Gabo'll get to play with you first. I'm sorry but my diary's full. How about next week? I guess you won't get bored, many guys want to play with you. You there? -I'll fucking kill you both. Let's make a deal. A swap. OK. Leave Gabo in Ippe's yard. Give the phone to Ippe. The Skatta football field, half an hour. If the dog's not in your yard I won't show up. Whistle if he calls anyone. What the fuck is he up to? Fucking midget. You're dead meat if he tries anything funny. Relax. He'll be here. -1 fucking hope so. Ippe, you can go now. He's got my keys. -Give him the keys. When I get the magazine. Put that toy down, you might hurt yourself. Listen midget, this thing's got no batteries. Come and see. We're going to lisalmi and Kajaani day after tomorrow - back on Sunday. If I do it today it'll have time to dry. Want to come along as a roadie? -Don't know. We'll see. You can stay here for another week. If your nerves hold up. -Sure they do, I live here. Your nerves've been holding up surprisingly long. A moped! Come! Caught any fish? I'm blending in with the natives. Two milks, rye bread, margarine, cheese, mince. Spaghetti, tomato sauce, onions. -Bloody hell. What about some beers? We could take a sauna. The dead man had drug connections Hallo! Did you hear me? -I'm underage. You have to get them yourself. -Put a kid on the job. Is it finished? -Fuck, you scared me. Not bad. And now of course they'll change the band's name. I think I'll go home. -Shall I take you to the bus now? No, day after tomorrow. I'm in no hurry. Mother'll be home by then. I was afraid you can't go back. -Home? Why not? Just a thought. You haven't liked it here any more than before. Mia and I broke up. That's how serious it is. Mojo said we had a common hobby. -We did. But I've changed it. Good. To what? Meditation. Greetings from the country. -Hi. Did it work? What? -The magazine joke. No. Not the way I planned it. - It happens. What's new? This. It's awful. It's not you at all. Why did you do something like that? I don't always understand the things that go on in your head. You could sometimes stop and think before doing things. I'm trying. I thought I'd have to drag the harbour to find you. That wall needs a big one. This's a fucking bad place to do it. - I know. I had to take off almost before I'd begun. -What've you been doing? Staying at home with mother. She's cleaned up her act - but Sami will stay with dad for the time being. You heard anything? -He calls me every day. I didn't mean Sami. -No? Who the fuck then? Who the fuck do you think? -Don't you read the papers? Sure I read the papers, or I'd still be out there. But they didn't say if anyone's been asking for Chip'n'Dale. 1 dunno, don't think so. But I heard they offed Kalle right away, and the dog, too. But it's OK for us? I can go out if I'm bored out of my mind at home? I guess so. And we got a fortune. But as things stand we can't put the stamps on the market. Did you hide them? -I've got a stash in the salon. That wall needs a big one. -Yeah, we've talked about it. I thought so, too. Your old one's still unfinished. The fuck you're doing? You been taking that shit? Fucking moron. Fucking Ippe. You know penguins can't fly. They dive. Fucking zombie. Do you know anything about what's going on? I do. But I think I'm going home. I must take this Game Boy to Sami. -But not today. You go home now, take a shower and try and get some sleep. Hallo. We must get off. Papu. Ippe. Saint Ippe. Your wings make a loud buzz. Stop that clowning. Papu? What fucking state did they say he's in? I don't remember. But there's no one at home. I can't watch him. I'll wait outside. Papu. Remember to give this to Sami. Like to go out somewhere? Tonight? Mother's taking me to see some fucking opera. How about tomorrow? -I'm baby-sitting for my brother. Want to come and listen to the kid bawl? Perhaps. I'll call you. -OK. Subtitles: Mikko Lyytikainen / MOVISION
