BACK IN THE FIRST TIMES, IN THE TIME OF THE RED LIGHT, THE DESERT WIND-- SOO-OOP-WA-- WAS A MAN LIKE US, UNTIL BY MISCHANCE HE GREW WINGS... AND FLEW... LIKE A BIRD. HE BECAME A HUNTER, AND LIKE A HAWK, HE FLEW TO SEEK HIS PREY, TAKING REFUGE IN THOSE FAR CORNERS OF THE WORLD WHERE MAGIC STILL LINGERS IN THE EARTH. BUT HAVING ONCE BEEN A MAN, SO DOES HE STILL SUFFER THE PASSIONS OF A MAN. THE PEOPLE OF THE GREAT NAMIB-- ME AND MY ANCESTORS BEFORE ME-- WE HAVE ANOTHER NAME FOR THOSE VIOLENT WINDS THAT BLOW FROM NOWHERE. WE CALL THEM "DUST DEVILS." [FLOCK OF BIRDS FLIES] LIKE MOTHS INTO THE FLAME, THE DUST DEVIL DRAWS THEM INTO HIS FATAL AURA. HYPNOTIZED BY HIS RAZOR GLARE, THEY COME-- THE FAITHLESS, THE GRIEVING, THE LOST. SAARTJIE. YOU'RE ALMOST THERE. [WOMAN BREATHING HEAVILY] [NECK SNAPS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] [RING] [RING] HELLO? HELLO? ROBINSON HOUSE. HELLO? WHO IS THIS? [FAINT GASP] [HANGS UP PHONE] WHO WAS THAT? NO ONE. JUST A CROSSED LINE. GO BACK TO SLEEP. WHAT TIME DID YOU GET IN? THEIR DEATH... IS GIFT TO THEM. THEIR BLOOD... THE TRIBUTE HE TAKES TO PAINT HIS WAY OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF INCARNATION. LORD, WE PRAY FOR RELEASE FROM THIS DROUGHT. SEND US THE SOFT RAINS OF YOUR MERCY! THE EARTH CRIES OUT TO YOU! THE CATTLE DIE IN THE FIELDS! THE CROPS WITHER IN THE SPRINGTIME! FORGIVE US, LORD, AND SEND US THE POWER TO FORGIVE. SEND US PEACE FROM THESE TROUBLED TIMES. SEND US THE PEACE OF YOUR RAIN AGAINST OUR BROWS. WATCH FOR THE EVIL AND DRIVE IT FROM OUR HEARTS AND FROM OUR LANDS. LOOK TO THE WEST INTO THE WASTELAND, FOR FROM THENCE COMETH THE EVIL. HIS SHADOW FOLLOWS ACROSS THE WAYS OF THE RIGHTEOUS AND MAKETH THEM AS COLD DUST. EVEN THE INNOCENT AND THE BABE AT ARMS-- THE SUN HAS GONE OUT FROM THEIR PASTURES AND A SHADOW HAS BLIGHTED THEIR BEING-- THE SHADOW OF THAT OLD SERPENT WHO DECEIVETH THE WORLD AND LEAD IT INTO DAMNATION AND NOW CONTROLS EVERLASTING FIRE! YOU'RE LYING TO ME, WENDY! WHERE WERE YOU? GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! OUT! YOUR HOUSE? YOUR HOUSE, YOU BASTARD! I'M NOT CHANGING MY MIND, NOT THIS TIME. NO! WAIT! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? MARK, I'M LEAVING YOU! RUNNING TO HIM WILL FIX THINGS? TALK TO ME! JUST LET ME GO. NO. WAIT! WENDY, PLEASE. I'M SORRY. WENDY, DON'T DO THIS! YOU KNOW YOU'LL BE BACK! AW, SHIT! [POLICE RADIO] TAKE CASTS OF THE FOOTPRINTS. SEAL OFF OUTGOING ROADS. ANY INDICATION THAT IT'S POLITICALLY MOTIVATED? IT'S FAR TOO EARLY TO EVEN CONSIDER IT. WE SHOULD PROCEED WITH THE INVESTIGATION AS A LOCAL INCIDENT UNTIL WE SEE WHAT EVIDENCE ARISES. I'VE PUT MY BEST MAN ON THIS. AS LONG AS IT'S NOT YOU. YES, SIR. I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. HELL OF A WAY TO START THE DAY, HUH? FUCKING NIGHTMARE. WHOLE PLACE HAS BEEN GUTTED. HOUSE IS FULL OF BODY PARTS. LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN HIT BY A COMMANDO UNIT. I THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH TERRORISTS. THERE ARE NO TERRORISTS THESE DAYS--CEASE FIRE. IT'S A FREE COUNTRY. ACH! ACH, MAN! THE VICTIM WAS WHITE? PROBABLY--HARD TO TELL FROM WHAT'S LEFT. THE HOUSE WAS OWNED BY THE HAARHOFF FAMILY. THE KIDS ARE GROWN UP AND GONE AWAY. MR. HAARHOFF WORKS AS A SITE FOREMAN FOR A COPPER MINE ACROSS THE BORDER IN SOUTH AFRICA. WE'RE TRYING TO CONTACT HIM. MRS. HAARHOFF? MY BET IS THAT'S HER IN THE HOUSE. SIR! AT EASE. THESE LOST ISRAELIS LYING IN THE SAND DYING WHEN JUST ACROSS THE DESERT, COMES THIS P.L.O. GUY TO SHOOT THEM. HE CRIES OUT, "WHAT WAS THAT, A VACANCY?" "NO," SAYS THE P.L.O. GUY, "IT WAS AN AMBUSH." [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] THE THINGS I'VE SEEN-- THE THINGS I'VE SEEN, YOU WON'T BELIEVE. YOU BEEN IN A WAR? HOW FAR IS THIS TRAIN GOING? IT GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE SEA. WHAT'S THE NEXT STOP? BETHANY-- SOME SHITHOLE LIKE THAT. ANYBODY EVER GET OFF THERE? NAH. TRAIN TANKS UP WITH WATER. PEOPLE GET ON AT BETHANY. NOBODY GETS OFF. [RADIO] THE LITTLE TOWN OF BETHANY, JUST INSIDE NAMIBIA'S SOUTHERN BORDER, IS DOOMED. THE RECORD SEVEN-YEAR DROUGHT HAS ALREADY DEVASTATED CATTLE HERDS, AND WITH THE CLOSURE OF THE LOCAL URANIUM MINE BROUGHT ON BY THE WITHDRAWAL OF SOUTH AFRICAN INVESTMENT, BETHANY'S LAST SOURCE OF REVENUE AND FRESH WATER WILL FINALLY DRY UP. [CROSSING BELL RINGS] [CROSSING BELL RINGS] HE HAS BEEN HERE SINCE THE FIRST TIMES, PASSING FROM ONE HUMAN HOST TO ANOTHER. SEARCHING OUT THE DAMNED, HE WALKS THIS WORLD DRAWN TO HIS PREY AS THEY ARE DRAWN TO HIM. HE SMELLS BETHANY DYING, AND NOW HE'S COME FOR THE SOULS HE NEEDS, SOULS TO EMPOWER HIS RETURN TO THE REALM OF THE SPIRIT. [GUNSHOTS] HE HAS KIN... THOUGH HIS PEOPLE ARE FEW. FIRE! [GUNSHOTS] THEY SEE EACH OTHER, BEHIND THEIR MASKS OF FLESH. BUT LIKE THE HAWK, THEY HUNT ALONE. LOAD. EYES FRONT. FIRE! [GUNSHOT] HELLO, OPERATOR. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COLLECT CALL. YES. PRETORIA 885-82. [OPERATOR] PLEASE HOLD THE LINE. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [BEEP] [WENDY] WENDY AND MARK ARE OUT. TO LEAVE A MESSAGE, SPEAK AFTER THE TONE. [BEEP] THIS IS THE BETHANY OPERATOR CALLING SOUTH AFRICA FROM NAMIBIA. WILL YOU ACCEPT THE CHARGES? HELLO? BETHANY OPERATOR. HELLO? I'M SORRY. THERE'S NO ONE ANSWERING. THANK YOU. IT'S ALL RIGHT. [MEOW] * KILLERS AND SWINDLERS AND THIEVES * * IT'S HARDER TO GROW ROSES * * THAN ROCKS AND TUMBLEWEEDS * * WHEN HE WALKED IN THE BARROOM * * EERIE SILENCE FELL * THE SIGHT OF THE BLOOD-RED COLORS * * OF THE ROSE IN HIS LAPEL * * A PURE, ENCHANTING PERFUME * * OF THE ROSE IN HIS LAPEL * DEAR MARK, I'M GOING ON A LONG HOLIDAY AND DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN UNTIL I GET MY HEAD STRAIGHT. I KNOW I STILL NEED YOU, BUT I CAN NEVER BE THE WIFE YOU WANT. GO ON, GIVE ME... [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] [BEEP] THIS IS THE BETHANY OPERATOR CALLING SOUTH AFRICA FROM NAMIBIA. WILL YOU ACCEPT THE CHARGES? [MUSIC AND PINBALL MACHINE NOISE] HELLO? BETHANY OPERATOR. HELLO? I'M SORRY. THERE'S NO ONE ANSWERING. [WENDY] THANK YOU. IT'S ALL RIGHT. [DIAL TONE] [BEEP] UHH... HE HEARS THE SILENT CALL OF THE DAMNED, THE FAITHLESS, AND NEVER FAILS TO ANSWER. BUT ONLY WHEN THEY ARE TRULY READY WILL HE DRAW THEM INTO HIS DARK EMBRACE. WHO'S THERE? [BIRD CHIRPS] [AWWK] OHH... [CAR WON'T START] UGH! WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT YOUR WOMAN APART FROM HER BEING WHITE? SHE DIED NEAR BETHANY, DOCTOR. HE DIDN'T DO HER ANY FAVORS. WE'VE JUST GOT ABOUT EVERYTHING HERE-- EVISCERATION, PARTIAL CREMATION, SEXUAL MUTILATION, AND POSSIBLY EVEN CANNIBALISM. WE FOUND THE... REMAINS OF A CLOCK WEDGED INSIDE HER, FOR GOD'S SAKE. WHAT'S YOUR THEORY ON ACTUAL CAUSE-- I MEAN, JUST OFF THE RECORD? SHE WASN'T TIED DOWN. I'D SAY SHE MAY HAVE BEEN STRANGLED FIRST. HER NECK'S DISLOCATED, AND... THE SPINAL CORD'S SEVERED BETWEEN THE ATLAS AND AXIAL VERTEBRAE. WE KNOW THAT MUCH. GOD KNOWS... MAYBE SHE LET HIM DO IT TO HER. THE ONLY REALLY INTERESTING STUFF WE'VE GOT SO FAR IS IN THE SCRAPINGS FROM THE MURAL. BUT WE'LL NEED SPECIALIST HELP IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANY FURTHER WITH IT. GO AHEAD. WHAT AM I MEANT TO BE LOOKING AT? HE HAD TO MIX OTHER MATERIALS WITH HER BLOOD TO BRING OUT THOSE COLORS. WE FOUND TRACES OF IRON OXIDE AND HEMATITE. THE WHITES AND LIGHTER SHADES WERE ACHIEVED BY MIXING THE VICTIM'S FAT WITH KAOLIN AND... SEA GULL GUANO. THE MAN'S AN ARTIST. HE LEFT NO PRINTS. THIS STUFF'S CLOSELY RELATED TO WITCHCRAFT. ARE YOU SERIOUS? PERFECTLY. HUMAN BODY PARTS ALL HAVE THEIR USES IN RITUAL MAGIC. A WITCH OR SANGOMA COULD TELL FROM THE MISSING PIECES WHAT OUR MAN WAS AFTER. YOU MUST HAVE A LOCAL SANGOMA. WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM ABOUT IT? HI. JOE? I'VE BEEN TALKING TO HIM, BEN. HE SAID... HE'S GOING TO END THE WORLD REAL QUICK NOW. THE EARTH'S GOING TO DRY UP... CRACK. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT, JOE. I WANT TO KNOW... WHO DID THIS? SHEESH! I SEE YOUR PROBLEM. ONE LAST NIGHT. YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT? THIS... I WOULD SAY THIS... IS A CLUE... FOR OFFICER MUKUROB. IT'S A SHAME THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THIS BULLSHIT, HUH? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER I BELIEVE IN IT. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. MY FRIEND, THIS STUFF-- TO KNOW IT, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IT. IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR A MAN IN YOUR POSITION WHO'S TAKEN THE CHOICES YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS MAGIC. HE TOOK HER FINGERS. WHY DID HE DO THAT? THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF POWER... IN FINGERS-- KNOTS AND KNUCKLES AND SUCH. IF YOU WANT TO WIN A WAR, YOU NEED A WHOLE FISTFUL OF KNUCKLES. YOU, UH... YOU SMOKE TOO MUCH. MAYBE YOU SHOULD HELP ME LAY SOME ROCKS. IT MIGHT BE EASIER FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND. YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN WHEN YOU DEAL WITH MAGIC. YEAH, JOE. THERE'S, UH... MAGIC ALL AROUND US. YEAH, YOU BET. ALL AROUND YOU, FRIEND. HELLO? HELLO? IS ANYONE THERE? HELLO? ANYONE AWAKE? HELLO? ARE YOU THE DRIVER? ARE YOU THE DRIVER? DO YOU DRIVE? NO. NO, I DON'T DRIVE. UH, NOT THIS. MY CAR IS OVER THERE. I THINK I'M STUCK IN THE SAND. COULD YOU HELP? WHERE YOU HEADING FOR? NOWHERE. I JUST CAME FROM THERE. ANYPLACE ELSE I'M GOOD FOR. CLIMB ABOARD. I SAW YOU AT THE ROADHOUSE YESTERDAY. FIGURED WE WERE ON THE SAME ROAD. I COULD SEE YOU NEEDED A RIDE. THE NAME'S WENDY. PLEASED TO MEET YOU. ARE YOU A SERVICEMAN? I'M A TOURIST. ARE YOU FROM THE STATES? TEXAS, MAYBE? I TRAVEL A LOT. GREW UP ON THE ROAD. IT'S THE ONLY PLACE I FEEL AT HOME. WHERE WAS IT YOU WERE HEADING TO? WHY? HOW FAR ARE YOU GOING? STRAIGHT THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE SEA. YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FROM SOMETHING, ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DON'T KNOW. YOU JUST LOOK LIKE YOU MIGHT BE RUNNING FROM SOMETHING. THAT'S ALL. LIKE MAYBE YOU COMMITTED A MURDER, AND THE POLICE WERE AFTER YOU. NO. I WISH! YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT? NO. THAT'S O.K. WE'VE GOT NOTHING BUT TIME. HEY, JOHANN... GO CALL BEN ON THE RADIO. TELL HIM WE FOUND SOMETHING HERE, MAN. [VOMITING] YOU MUST BELIEVE IN SOMETHING. GOD? THE DEVIL? THE SOUL, AT LEAST. DON'T BE SILLY. I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT ANY MORE THAN I BELIEVE IN MAGIC OR PETER PAN. SURELY YOU'D HAVE TO ADMIT SOME SUPERIOR FORCE GUIDES YOUR HAND. FUCK SUPERIOR FORCES. WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, YOU'RE DEAD. THAT'S IT. KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE ROAD. YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL ASLEEP. HEY, THAT LOOKS-- DON'T STOP. DRIVE ON. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? OH, GOD. JESUS CHRIST. HEY, TEXAS! TEXAS! OOH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? STOP IT, MAN! WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR? FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? NOTHING WORSE THAN WHAT THE BOYS DID TO SAARTJIE, OR WHAT HE WOULD DO TO US GIVEN THE CHANCE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN US? I'M NOT ONE OF YOU. HE WOULD'VE TALKED TO ME. SO WE GOT HEAVY WITH HIM. SO WHAT? AT LEAST WE'VE GOT SOMETHING TO GO ON NOW. SHE'S A WHITE GIRL... IN HER LATE 20s OR EARLY 30s. SHE WAS RIGHT THERE AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. HE SAYS HE HELPED HER PUSH-START HER CAR. A RED VOLKSY WITH CITY PLATES. SHOULD BE PISS-EASY TO PULL IN, MAN. IT'S A BREAK, MAN. THE FIRST REAL BREAK WE'VE HAD. RELEASE THIS MAN. HE'S A MATERIAL WITNESS. I DON'T CARE! RELEASE HIM! KATIE. KATIE. THE HAARHOFF WOMAN IS HERE, SIR. SHE'S IN HERE, SIR. SHE'S BEEN WAITING FOR YOU, SIR. I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO HER. SAARTJIE... I'M SORRY. I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN. I... I WAS DREAMING. THAT WAS NO DREAM. AAH! YOU IN A LOT OF TROUBLE, PAL. AM I...AWAKE? NO, MY FRIEND. NOW YOU DREAMING. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO FRIGHTEN YOU. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? HOW DID YOU GET INTO MY CAR? HOW DID YOU GET OUT OF IT LAST NIGHT? YOU FELL ASLEEP. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING CRAZY. WE SHOULD BE GOING. YOU'RE STILL GOING TO THE SEA, AREN'T YOU? WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE I STILL WANT TO GIVE YOU A RIDE? * TRAVEL ALONE * ON THE JERICHO ROAD * TRAVEL ALONE * ON THE JERICHO ROAD * TRAVEL ALONE * ON THE JERICHO ROAD * I'M GONNA TRAVEL WITH MY JESUS * * OH, YES, I'M GONNA * TRAVEL ALONE * ON THE JERICHO ROAD * OH, YES, I'M GONNA * TRAVEL ALONE * ON THE JERICHO ROAD * OH, YES, I'M GONNA * TRAVEL ALONE * ON THE JERICHO ROAD * YES, I'M GONNA * I'M GOIN' TO TRAVEL WITH MY JESUS... * PUT THE TOP ON. GIVE IT A TWIST. KORNELIUS, YOUR MAN IS HERE. AH. BEN. AT LAST. GLAD YOU MADE IT. I'D ALMOST GIVEN UP ON YOU. I WAS AT A FUNERAL. COME ON. WE'D BETTER GO IN THE HOUSE. KORNELIUS, YOU SAID YOU WERE READY. WAIT IN THE CAR. I'LL JUST BE A MOMENT. I BROUGHT EVERYTHING I COULD FIND. I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS MANY. HERE, BEN. LOOK AT THE DATE. CHRIST, THIS IS FROM 1952. THEY GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE WAR. I EVEN FOUND ONE FROM 1908. SOME HOOKER GOT HERSELF STABBED IN KLEIN KARIB STATION. THEY FOUND A POCKET WATCH UP HER PUSS. THAT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIM. THAT WAS BEFORE HE WAS BORN. DO YOU EVER ASK YOURSELF HOW MANY MURDERERS ARE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING EVERY YEAR... DIE IN CAR ACCIDENTS OR OTHER ACTS OF GOD? A GREAT MANY, PROBABLY. IT WOULD MAKE AN INTERESTING STATISTIC. KORNELIUS! [HONKS HORN] [SHOUTING] HURRY UP! I'D BETTER NOT KEEP HER WAITING. NO, I SUPPOSE NOT. THIS IS ALL I CAN DO. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AFTER YOURSELF NOW, BEN. I SAW MR. HAARHOFF'S EYES AT THE FUNERAL. HE DIDN'T LOVE HER. NOBODY LOVED HER. NOBODY CARED ABOUT HER. YEAH, BEN. REMEMBER TO LOCK UP. YOU'VE DONE IT. MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE EDGE OF THE WORLD. OH, MY GOD! THIS IS AMAZING. THIS IS THE HOME OF THE GREAT SNAKE FATHER KOUTEIGN KOUROO. IN THE DAWN OF THINGS, HE MADE THIS PLACE FROM THE LASHING OF HIS COILS. DON'T...DON'T SPOIL IT. BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. Shh. [PLAYING MUSIC] AH! AH! WHAT'S THAT? PROBABLY JUST SOME BORED SOLDIER MESSING AROUND. * I CAN SETTLE DOWN * AND BE DOING JUST FINE * * TILL I HEAR THOSE TRAINS * * ROLLING DOWN THE LINE * THEN I HEAR HIS BRAKES * * ON THE TRACK * AND IF I DID... CARE TO DANCE? * I'D LEAVE, I'D BLOW MY STACK * * I LOVE YOU, BABY * BUT YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND * * WHEN THE LORD MADE ME * HE MADE A RAMBLING MAN * * SOME FOLKS MIGHT SAY * THAT I'M NO GOOD * THAT I WOULDN'T SETTLE * * DOWN IF I COULD * BUT WHEN THAT OPEN ROAD * * STARTS TO CALLIN' ME * THERE'S SOMETHIN' O'ER THE HILL * * THAT I GOTTA SEE... [REGGAE MUSIC PLAYS] EXCUSE ME. I WONDER IF YOU CAN HELP ME. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE. SORRY? A WHITE LADY. HER NAME'S WENDY. WENDY ROBINSON. I'VE GOT A PHOTOGRAPH. SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW HER. SHE CAME IN HERE TWO DAYS AGO AND USED THE TELEPHONE. JUST PASS IT AROUND. YOU MUST HAVE COME THROUGH THE WRONG DOOR. I BEG YOUR PARDON? YOU MUST GO TO THE OTHER SIDE. THE WHITE BAR. JUST BECAUSE SHE'S WHITE DOESN'T MEAN YOU COULDN'T SEE HER. NO ONE HERE HAS SEEN SUCH A PERSON. PLEASE, MAN. I'M LOOKING FOR MY WIFE. HEY, YOU. HEY, YOU RECOGNIZE HER, DON'T YOU? NO ONE HAS SEEN ANYTHING HERE. THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU HERE. STOP PLAYING BLOODY GAMES WITH ME, O.K.? THAT'S THE PINBALL MACHINE I HEARD WHEN SHE CALLED ME! WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME IS MARK ROBINSON. I'M HER HUSBAND. WE'RE MARRIED! YOU'RE A POLICEMAN, I THINK. WHAT? LOOK, MAN, I RUN A SPORTS SHOP, O.K.? WHAT FOR YOU WEARING A UNIFORM? I WAS IN THE ARMY! COMPULSORY MILITARY TRAINING! SOUTH AFRICA! GIVE ME BACK MY PASSPORT. DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD, SOUTH AFRICA? OF COURSE I DO! THEN I HOPE GOD CAN HELP YOU. AAH! FUCK! GET THE FUCK-- YOU'RE NO ONE'S HUSBAND NOW, SOUTH AFRICA. I WANT MY WIFE BACK. AHH. OHH... AHH. OHH! THIS IS THE WORK OF A DUST DEVIL. BLACK MAGICIAN. A SHAPE SHIFTER. HE GAINS POWER IN THIS WORLD THROUGH THE RITUAL ECSTASY OF MURDER. HE'S AS TRAPPED AS HIS VICTIMS. THE KILLINGS ARE A MEANS TO AN END, AND THAT END IS HIS TRANSFORMATION, HIS TRANSCENDENCE... HIS ESCAPE. UHH! CUFF HIM, BOTES. CUFF HIM! ONE WRONG MOVE AND I'LL SKIN YOUR FAT, WHITE NECK. NO! YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING TOO MANY DRIVE-IN MOVIES. MY FRIEND, YOU... YOU GOT TO STOP THINKING LIKE A WHITE MAN... AND START THINKING LIKE A MAN INSTEAD. OTHERWISE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN BIG TROUBLE WITH THIS. HE'S FLESH AND BLOOD LIKE US. HE MUST BE. YOU CAN'T HUNT A DUST DEVIL LIKE A ORDINARY CRIMINAL. HE'S OF THE SPIRIT. WE'RE NOTHING TO HIM. WE ARE HERE JUST TO USE AND DISCARD. HIS WORLD IS OLDER THAN OURS. HE HAS BEEN HERE SINCE THE FIRST TIMES, HE AND HIS KIN, WALKING IN OUR SHADOWS, THEIR HEARTS AS DRY AS THE DESERT SANDS. LEECHES...GROWING FAT ON THE WORLD'S PAIN. Fill the bowl. [VOICES WHISPER] UNTIL THIS RITUAL IS COMPLETED, HE IS TRAPPED... LIKE US IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, BOUND BY THE FLESH. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO RUB OUT A DUST DEVIL. HE MUST WORK THROUGH HUMAN FORM WHILE HE'S IN THIS WORLD... SO HE'S VULNERABLE TO HUMAN FAILINGS. ONLY THROUGH RITUAL... THROUGH GAINING POWER OVER THE FLESH... CAN SPIRIT AWAKE TO FULLER CONSCIOUSNESS. TO WORK THE RITUAL, HE MUST KEEP MOVING. MOVING. BUT IF HE CAN BE TRICKED... TO STEP ACROSS THIS KIERIE... HE CAN BE ROOTED TO THE SPOT AND STRIPPED OF HIS POWER. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS, JOE. YOU... YOU MUST BIND HIM WITH A STICK. STRIKE A BLOW. IT'S THE ONLY WAY. BIND HIM WITH THE STICK... AND BURN THE ROOT. DRIVE AWAY HIS SHADOW. FAIL IN THIS, AND HE WILL TAKE YOU, HIS MURDERER, TO BE HIS NEW HOST. TAKE THE STICK. YOU MUST COMPLETE THE RITUAL. BURN THE ROOT. YOU MUST GO NOW, BEN MUKUROB, BUT GO CAREFUL. DEATH HUNTS YOU JUST AS YOU HUNT... THE DUST DEVIL. [WATER RUNS] DON'T TOUCH THAT! WHY? WHY, FOR GOD'S SAKE? I SWEAR TO GOD, WENDY, I NEVER HAD ANY CHOICE. THEY WANTED TO DIE. I JUST PUT THEM OUT OF THEIR MISERY. YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND. DON'T YOU SEE THAT? NO. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. IT WAS THEIR CHOICE. THEY CAME TO ME. I CAN TELL WHEN SOMEONE'S TIME IS UP. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? YOU KNOW WHO I AM. GOD, YOU'RE NOT FROM TEXAS. I'M FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR. I COME FROM YOU. WHY--WHY-- BECAUSE YOU NEED HELP. ANYBODY CAN SEE THAT. YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE EDGE... LIKE THE DESERT SKY... AT NIGHT... JUST AFTER SUNSET... OR MAYBE JUST BEFORE THE DAWN. YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE. DAY OR NIGHT? AAH! YOU HAVE A SPARK OF LIGHT INSIDE OF YOU. I'M JUST A MIDWIFE. ALL I HAVE TO DO... IS MAKE A SMALL INCISION AND LET IT OUT... RELAX. IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW. EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT. I'M RIGHT HERE. I SHOULD'VE DONE THIS DAYS AGO, BUT I GET LONELY SOMETIMES. FORGIVE ME. I WON'T KEEP YOU WAITING ANY LONGER. THERE'S NO GOOD OR EVIL... ONLY SPIRIT AND MATTER. ONLY MOVEMENT TOWARD THE LIGHT... AND AWAY FROM IT. IT'S ALL ALIKE. ALL OF IT. AAH! OH, PLEASE. YOU PICKED THE WRONG GIRL, YOU SON OF A BITCH! GRR! [AIR HORN SOUNDS] [ARGUING] [EERIE SCREAMING] [WOMAN] OH, MY GOD. I'M DYING, YOU BLOODY FOOL! [SCREAMING IN AFRIKAANS] CALM DOWN, ANDRE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? [SWEARING IN AFRIKAANS] [SWEARING IN AFRIKAANS] ANDRE, QUICK, COME AWAY. RUN, CHILDREN! RUN! RUN! AAH! YA-HOO! [CELL DOOR SLAMS] IS THIS YOUR WIFE? IT'S FOR YOU. YOU ARE A GOOD MAN, AND I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU, NOR DO I WANT TO SEE YOU HURT YOURSELF, BUT I MUST LEAVE YOU AND SOUTH AFRICA FOR GOOD. DON'T BLAME YOURSELF, AND DON'T LOOK FOR ME OR TRY TO FOLLOW ME. YOU MUST BE STRONG NOW AND TRY TO BE KIND TO YOURSELF. LOVE, WENDY. HER TRACKS LED STRAIGHT ON TO OPEN DESERT. VULTURE CITY. I WOULDN'T RATE ANYONE'S CHANCES IN IT ON FOOT. CAN'T YOU CALL IN AIR SUPPORT OR SOMETHING? GET A COUPLE OF HELICOPTERS TO COMB THE AREA. NO CHOPPERS. NOT HERE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIND HER LIKE THIS. AT LEAST CALL SOME EXTRA COPS TO HELP US. WHAT KIND OF FUCKED-UP THIRD WORLD COUNTRY IS THIS? THERE ARE NO MORE POLICE, JUST YOU AND ME... NO COUNTRIES, JUST THIS... JUST THE HUNTING GROUND. DO YOU THINK I FUCKING CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU AND YOUR WIFE? THAT'S FUCKING OPEN DESERT OUT THERE! LISTEN, RAMBO, IF IT WAS YOUR WIFE, YOU'D FEEL THE SAME. MY WIFE LEFT ME 15 YEARS AGO WHEN OUR SON GOT KILLED ON THE BORDER, SO DON'T TELL ME THIS SHIT! WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GRIEF? AT LEAST I STILL STAND A CHANCE WITH MINE. LET'S GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE! [COUGHING] KEEP THE WINDOWS CLOSED! I CAN'T BLOODY WELL BREATHE IN HERE, MAN! WHAT ARE YOU BURNING THIS THING FOR? TO KEEP IT OUT. NO! AAH! [GUNSHOTS] [GUN COCKS] [GUNSHOT] WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? GET OUT OF THE WAY! GOD! STOP SHOOTING! THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE! LISTEN! PUT DOWN YOUR GUN, OR I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL BLOW YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF! I MEAN IT! I TOOK OUT THE BULLETS. AFTER 15 YEARS, DO YOU THINK I'D LET SOMEONE LIKE YOU FUCK IT UP FOR ME? PUT THEM ON! ONE ON THE WRIST AND ONE ON THE BUMPER. DON'T LEAVE ME LIKE THIS! YEAH, THERE YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE. HE ONLY TAKES THOSE WHO'VE GOT NOTHING. COME BACK HERE! PLEASE, MAN! SHE HAS STEPPED THROUGH THE MIRROR NOW, AND SHE AND HE ARE ONE-- PARTNERS IN A DANCE OF DEATH FROM WHICH NEITHER CAN WITHDRAW UNTIL THE CIRCLE IS COMPLETED. WENDY. YOU'RE ALMOST THERE. YOU'RE ALMOST THERE. [GASPS] WENDY. WENDY. OH...OH, GOD! NO! NO, PLEASE, NO. THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY HERE! [CROW CAWS] [FLIES AWAY] [BEN] MRS. ROBINSON? MRS. ROBINSON? WHO ARE YOU? [HINGE CREAKS] DO YOU HEAR IT? TAKE THIS. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. STAY HERE UNTIL I CALL YOU. [LAUGHTER] [RAGTIME PIANO MUSIC PLAYS] [LAUGHTER] JOE? WHO'S THERE? WHO'S THAT? KATIE. YOU'RE ALMOST THERE. ALMOST THERE. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] [COUGHING] [HINGE CREAKS] [GASPS] CAN'T FIX THIS. IT'S ON SAFETY. IT'S THE LITTLE LEVER NEXT TO THE BREECH. BACK OFF! HANDS IN THE AIR! I MEAN IT! WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, SHOOT ME? FUCK YES! THERE'S A STORM COMING. I THINK IT'S GOING TO RAIN. [THUNDER] LOOK AT MY HAND. ALL FIVE BEAMS WILL STAY WITH YOU. YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME, WENDY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SHOOT ME. [DEEP, SLOW VOICE] I LOVE YOU, WENDY. [VOICES ON POLICE RADIO] WENDY? WENDY! I--I'VE COME TO TAKE YOU HOME. WAIT FOR ME! WENDY! AGGH! [VOICES ON POLICE RADIO] THE DESERT KNOWS HER NAME NOW. THE DEVIL HAS TAKEN HER HAND. HE HAS STOLEN BOTH HER EYES. WHEN SHE LOOKS INTO A MIRROR, SHE WILL SEE HIS SHADOW. THE DUST DEVIL MUST KEEP MOVING TO SURVIVE, BLOWN BY THE DESERT WIND, ON AND ON THROUGHOUT ETERNITY, WITHOUT REST OR PITY.
