Minh! Stop! Stop! Minh! This old kook… Time for your medication. Give it to me! I have to call my daughter. Go! You're so stubborn. Take your medicine! Or else I'll call Director Chau! I'm going to tell Loan! - Aren't you afraid of Dr. Chau? - No! You're trying to kill me! Loan! The number you have dialed is unavailable. Please leave a message after the beep. Understood. But… where is Loan? Hey! Hey! Stop! Get back here! Stop! BUI VIEN STREET HUU PHUC TRAVEL That's it. I'm done. The other place pays me double. Plus, the cops have been sniffing around. If you don't pony up, I'm out. Flower shop? I'd like a large funeral arrangement delivered to 38A Bui Vien, District 1. The message? "Rest in peace, my dear friend…" "Phuc." You sound like a gang boss. What else would I sound like? In an hour, you'll be dead. Binh, please! Pretend I never said anything. - Put it on my tab! - Whatever you say, hot shot! Just take the whole cart! Miss, you can't sell here. Come with us. Oh God. DUC CHAU ASYLUM Hey, shipper! Right on time. I'm not just a shipper. Phuc was thinking of quitting, but I kept him in line. Dung, let me join the gang. Kill Phuc. - What? - Kill Phuc. Take over his company. Then you can join. See? You're not ready. Wait here, shipper. One day, you'll all work for me. Don't worry, captain. They're with us. New hires. All superheroes. A seven-foot observation tower, gathering all kinds of intel. There, an expert German negotiator. He's telling the snails not to rush through life. And there, the sniper. He aims well. But rarely hits. They're the Vietnamese Avengers. And I am Bo… James Bo. I noticed you talking to the suspect. Do you have any more intel, captain? Vice-captain, we need to gather evidence. Monitor the suspect's movement. Copy that. - Why is your salute so weird? - I cannot salute properly here. Take that to the pawn shop in District 5. I'll transfer your fee. As for joining the gang, I'll talk to the boss. Okay. CP.EXPRESS NEWSROOM Where have you been? What happened to your arm? My front-page article. I got caught. Had to run. Last time you chased down a story, I had to take you to the hospital. Haven't you learned anything? You promised me. I've got pictures and recordings. Just need you to sign off. Loan, stop being so reckless. You're just like I was. DUC CHAU ASYLUM What's so important about the front page? Hello? What did he do this time? MISSED CALLS DUC CHAU ASYLUM Miss Loan? I'm sorry for your loss. What happened to my father? Your father passed away during surgery this morning. I never authorized any surgery. We tried to call you, many times. But no one answered. We had to act. His blood pressure spiked and he suffered a heart attack. Director Chau, my father had health problems, but not high blood pressure. - I don't need to justify myself to you... - Director Chau… After discovering his elevated blood pressure, we did more tests. An angiogram revealed a blocked artery, so we performed emergency surgery. But unfortunately, there were complications. The last time I saw my dad, he was completely fine. And when was that? We'll transfer him to a funeral home. They'll handle the cremation. You know, he missed you. He was always trying to call you, hoping you'd come visit. My father and I didn't have the best relationship. Fathers and daughters… It's always complicated, isn't it? Actually, my father died a few years ago. He's the reason I became a surgeon. From one daughter to another, I know how you feel. Watch out! Agent Bo, where are you headed? I'm on a secret mission. On such a noisy bike? So they notice the balloons, not me. I have to go. We love our patients here. Bo is a famous novelist, you know. I'm sorry I was rude earlier. It's alright. Here. It's best to hold the service right away. Did your father have other family? I'M TELLING LOAN! YOU'RE DEAD! Who's messing around? Tell me! If they don't stop, they're dead! DIRECTOR'S OFFICE You're lying about my father! If I catch you snooping around again, you'll regret it. Just you wait. I'll find out the truth! Be my guest! Cuong said you two are best friends and roommates. Must be fun. How's work? Quite busy. I oversee a massive operation. And we're expanding. Setting up an office in Oxford, England. And Manchester in the US. You deliver stuff. That's right. Transportation! You know, Ngoc. I run a nationwide transportation system. The biggest in Southeast Asia. I already told Ngoc you're a shipper. That's all. - Why can't you just be honest? - I am being honest! I don't know why I bother. I try to set you up with a nice girl. But you always do this! - Who asked you... - You need a girl who's not too tall. Or too smart. A five or six. Well, Ngoc is totally average. Just look at her. A four, tops. I should go. Wait, hold on. You need someone who's not too hot or rich. Well, Ngoc's broke and still on the shelf... You two have fun dreaming about eights and nines! Miss Four is leaving. Ngoc, I didn't mean it like that! I don't understand at all, Bob. Let me speak Vietnamese then. Your computer got bitten by a virus. You need to be more careful. Do you mean "infected" by a virus? Correct! Now Bob will bite the virus back. I'll fix this for you. But stay off those adult sites. Thank you. Hey, Uyen! What is Bob doing? No one can understand him, so he gestures. He's inviting us to eat grapefruit. And steamed buns. Then to sing karaoke. Sing? I still have work to do. DUC CHAU ASYLUM… Something's going on there. Could be worth the front page. DOCTOR CHAU HAS DONATED MORE THAN ONE BILLION DONG CHARITABLE TRUST? I don't get it. Why do you keep messing around? "Hey girl, I'm a low-level goon. Let's get boba?" - Think she'd go for it? - Come work at my uncle's garage. Then you can tell Ngoc you sell motorbikes. And if she goes for it, then what? Here we go again. You're afraid she'll find out you're an orphan. You're a grown man. Take some responsibility. You're not a bad guy. Back in high school, those kids would've killed me without you. My uncle likes you. Go over there tomorrow. You're into bikes, right? I've got other plans. I'm gonna be a gang boss someday. No one will look down on me then. Don't you get it? You're a goon. That's what you should be embarrassed and ashamed of. DUNG And clean up after yourself! - I'm listening. - I've got a job for you. Intimidation. - How serious? - Scare her straight. Prove yourself. Pull this off and you can join the gang. POLICE STATION POLICE REPORT DEATH CERTIFICATE HUU PHAN DUC CHAU ASYLUM HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE HUU PHAN - DUC CHAU ASYLUM SURGEON DIES AT ASYLUM WHERE HE WORKED HIS DAUGHTER VAN CONTINUES HIS WORK My father and I had our issues. But it was only after he died that I realized how precious he was. VAN'S FATHER… Good night. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE Loan? The IT team asked Bob to go karaoke. Does Loan want to come with Bob? No, thanks. I just picked up the scent on something. Bob wants to help Loan. Bob wants to service Loan. That's okay… Other than doing IT, Bob also knows how to hack. You'd be surprised at what Bob's fingers can do. They can slip inside any off-limits place. Bob. The correct way to say it is, "I can infiltrate any security system." Okay. Bye. Welcome to GS25. DONE YET? I NEED MORE TIME. YOU WANT TO JOIN THE GANG OR NOT? Your total is 115,000 VND. - Do you take IOUs? - No. Right. Of course not. Can I return it? You already drank… I've got him. - How much? - 115,000 VND. No need. I work next door. Pay me back next time. Miss, your change. He can keep it. - I'm here. - Hello? - How is she? - Pretty cute. What? - I mean, I'm working on it. - Don't go easy on her. I'm working out my approach. I don't want to traumatize her. It's intimidation, not charity. You want to join the gang or not? Shit! Hey! Watch out! Thank you, sir. No problem. You're a good man. She was so beautiful you forgot your helmet? I forgot everything! She said, "You're a good man." You're never this happy when I say that! You're not pretty. And you lack certain… charms. I've never seen someone so sad and beautiful. How can I intimidate her? That's right. You shouldn't. The way she looked at me makes me… want to be a better person. Great! You two can go to Africa and help starving children. Listen. You should ask her out. Forget intimidation. If I quit, I'll never be a gang boss. You need to know what's most important. Take me. What's most important to me? My hand. As a guitarist, my hand is everything. It's the same with you two. You won't have a shot if you threaten her. - I don't have a shot anyway. - But there's a chance. Are you insane? She's a journalist for CP Express! I swear! All you need to remember is that you like her. You want to ask her out. Forget about being a goon. Forget all of it! Otherwise, stop dreaming about being a good guy. Goddamnit! I'm warning you. Drop the investigation! What investigation? - You know… - No, I don't. - Yes you do. - No. That thing you're investigating! Duc Chau Asylum? Stop baiting me. I'm not an idiot! Just stop doing that thing you're doing! Miss! - I'll break his arm! - It's already broken… Who hired you? - Don't say anything… - I don't know anything! Lies! - Please, let him go… - Who sent you?! Run! Run! I'll handle it! Stop! The blow to his head has induced a severe case of retrograde amnesia. So he doesn't remember anything? He'll get his memory back eventually. Maybe after a few weeks. It depends on his response to treatment. Sometimes the patient recovers without any treatment at all. And what treatments are those? Prompting memories through objects, sounds, smells… What happened to me? You were in an accident. They brought you here. So, who are you? Do you know me? I'm a psychologist. The hospital asked me to help you get your memory back. Let's get you out of here. I prefer to treat patients in their own homes. It's better that way. The hospital said you don't have any ID. No phone either. So, what now? Help me close the gate. First rule. Don't touch anything without my permission. I can't stand the noise. It's distracting. It's your home, not office. You don't like it, get treated somewhere else. Use this for now. Let's begin. Let's see if you remember anything. What was your job? Doctor? Teacher? Or… gangster? I'm not sure… But gangster… No way. Then try to picture a place you've been to. School. Bookstore. Bank. Hospital. None of the above. Maybe not a hospital, but some place with patients? Do you know something I don't, doctor? I'm just trying to spark your memory. Maybe music will help. Wait! This smell reminds me of a place… Remember anything? Stop, this is it! I've got a call. You go in first. You got a girlfriend now? What a shame! You owe me for eight boxes! Oh God, not again! Captain, you've finally returned. I've been going crazy waiting for you. Things are on a knife's edge. You know who I am? - What's wrong with you? - I have amnesia. - Here's the paperwork for your car. - Thank you. Some people from the trust would like to speak with you. They seem upset. So, I'm your captain? And we're investigating this place? Exactly. And I am Bo… James Bo. And you're a top special agent. Codenamed Hero Without a Gun at Gmail Dot Durian Rice. Report! Lately, there have been more suspicious deaths. Most recently, Minh. Who's Minh? Our comrade. Also known as Hero with Two Swords at Gmail Dot Rice with... God, his codename is too hard. Right… Minh. Wait. All official documents must have my fingerprint. No blood? Nothing? Let me. It hurts! Forget it. Everyone who died took this. Maybe the director changed their medicine. People think I'm crazy. But that's my cover. I must act crazy. And not just normal crazy. The craziest of all. Don't worry. Hey, shipper! Captain, be careful of him. Remember, this is classified. Absolutely confidential. Everyone, tell me honestly. Who's the craziest one in here? James Bo! Thank you. But we all need to work at becoming… Even crazier. Crazier! Where have you been? I've been calling. Sorry. I… lost my phone. Is it done? Is what done? Oh, yes. It's done. I did it, so by definition it's done. - Drop by the pawn shop this weekend. - Where? You hit your head? A Chay in District 5. Okay. Got it. What else? Someone said several patients died. Their medication was switched. They mentioned the director. Doc, I've been wondering… Why would a special agent be delivering packages? Maybe you were delivering something else. To a pawn shop? Something feels off. Shouldn't I be reporting to my handler? Maybe the pawn shop is your meetup. Someone there could be your partner. Or you're working undercover as a shipper to investigate the place. That makes sense. On a late autumn day While on a mission I met a doctor… Agent, you did great today. You'll have your memory back in no time. DIRECTOR CHAU? WHY? THE AMNESIA GOON, WHO'S HE WORKING FOR? A SURGEON DIED AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WORKED DISTRICT 5 PAWN SHOP? - What now, doc? - Go see if anyone recognizes you. Okay, I've got an idea. A CHAY PAWN SHOP - There's no appointment today. - Hero Without a Gun at Gmail Dot Durian. Hey! - Where are you going? - Can I use the bathroom? She's my girlfriend. - In the back. - Thank you. Be quick! Rolex! I want cash for it. This isn't a Rolex, it's a "Rolek." It's just a misspelling. The Swiss don't misspell. But it can still tell time perfectly. Not anymore. The hands just fell off. Take it back! Run! What? Go! Go! Come on, let's go! What was that bitch doing?! Hello? The girl with the glasses? The asylum is clearly laundering money. But who's behind it? I probably know, but I can't remember. I'm still sick. The asylum's received so many donations, but it looks run-down. Yet Chau drives a fancy new car. So you think he's embezzling donation money? And he killed whoever found out by changing their medication. But why kill crazy people? Crazy people can't lie. Imagine if someone called a relative and told them everything. Chau would be screwed. I say we tail him. See where he leads us. Are you a cop? You seem more like one than me. Eat up. Can't believe I got sucker punched. Some agent I am… Maybe you can't fight because you're not a field agent. If someone grabs your collar, grab their hand and twist. Then hit them in the face. Assume stance number four, and flip! Try it. Grab me. Twist their hand. Hit their face. I think poking them would be more effective. Then, stance four. If they're short, how can they grab my collar? Stand up. Grab me. Do you treat all your patients this well, doc? If they need it. - And they all crash here? - Only if they deserve it. Like a special agent. - Why did you do that? - I thought you'd duck. Whoa. This looks expensive. I bet it cost a fortune. Is it your boyfriend's? Some kind soul gave it to me to hold my father's ashes after his urn broke. What? You keep his ashes in this? This one broke. Then buy a new one. There's something I need to do first. Well, keeping him like this is wrong. - Just drop it. - You can't put him in this candy jar. What do you know about it? I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Go to sleep. We have to tail Chau tomorrow. You freaks. I work here! You told us to come quick. I got a job for you. Breaking bones? Slitting throats? No. There's a journalist. I want you to threaten her. That's no fun. You'll have to pay extra. Fine, I'll talk to the boss. I'm on my way, baby. What? Don't worry. I'm feeling it tonight! A new place this time? It's beautiful! - What do you think? - It's splendid. Welcome. Reservation for Chau. Just a moment. She's definitely working. I'd say she costs around $1,200. How would you know? - I read the news. - They have that in the news? Here's your key, sir. - Later, honey. - Your room key, sir. Room 508. This way, please. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. You hear that? 508. Okay, but now what? Why are we following him? He's got a key. What are you doing? How did you…? I'm a special agent. I can do anything. Let me go. Chau might be dangerous. Find out what's in Chau's suitcase. Slow down! Let me take my clothes off. No. I'll rip them off later! VIRILITY SUPPLEMENT He's so weak… Where are you taking me? On the couch, like Westerners. We're just warming up. Pace yourself, honey. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Let's get on the bed. - Where were we? - Just warming up. Let me catch my breath. Stay still, I'll get on top. Hold on! Can you get my pills? More? Which pill? Just get one of each. Or let's try standing. All the blood went to my head. Hold me so I don't fall. Is the blood going down? Yeah, but it's all in my feet now. Here, let me try something… What's wrong? I feel dizzy. I need a bath to regain my energy. Sorry… wrong room. This is my room! Then I must be wrong. Chau's definitely embezzling donation money to pay for his mistresses. Do you really think I'm a special agent? I think you're the key to this case. If I'm investigating the asylum, why don't I remember anything? You don't even remember your name. I guess it'll come back soon. That's right. Where are you going? I've got more work. Come on, sit down. Let's eat together. You know, maybe happiness is as simple as sharing a meal with someone. Did I say something? No. You're right. I'm just not that hungry. Can you sit somewhere else? That was my father's chair. JOURNALISM DEGREE Doctor? I have something important to ask. What is it? Are you okay? I'm sorry for upsetting you. It's fine. Get some sleep. Wait. What did you want to ask? I forgot. Good night. I'm checking on my dad's medical records. Alright. Get them to me as soon as you can. Thank you. MEDICAL RECORDS WHO PRESCRIBED NX? PAGING DR. LOAN. DINNER TONIGHT? NO. GOT WORK. PLEASE? Hey! I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING IMPORTANT. WE HAVE TO GO TO THIS PLACE. SEE YOU GUYS TONIGHT 8 P.M. DON'T FORGET TO BRING YOUR FRIENDS! CHILL WITH CHILLIES Amnesia! You had a memory here? Yes. A big, super important one. Let's go in. Thank you. Don't answer that. What if it's urgent? What are you doing? - Drink up. - I have to work later. We are working. Drink with me. Maybe I'll remember more. Good evening, we are Chillies! This first song is, "With You, Life is Beautiful." You knew Chillies would be here? Nope. So? Remember anything? Remember anything yet? I remember dancing with a girl. Must have been your girlfriend. If I knew, I wouldn't have amnesia. Help me remember, doctor. There was never a memory here, was there? - I'm not into that stuff. - I thought you got locked up. When did you get out? And you're with that girl! I don't understand. Quit playing dumb. Unzip this for me. Get off! Not again… What's wrong with you?! I have these vague memories. Like, I think my dad left when I was little. Things just got worse after that. But this is my chance to become the person I want to be. Maybe this condition is a blessing in disguise. Without it… we wouldn't have tonight. I think about my father too, when I'm not working. I've never seen you not work. Exactly. My father wanted me to be a homemaker. To have a husband and kids. But my dream was to have a career. I didn't want to depend on anyone else. My dad was bipolar, so I often avoided him. If only I had spent more time with him… Taken better care of him… Then I think, maybe… he would still be here. What's past is past. I got a second chance. Maybe you will too. It's the whole block. Anytime you don't feel like working, and want to hang out… Just give me a call. Thank you. I had a great time. It's late. We should get to bed. You can open the windows if you need some air. - I went over your draft. It looks good. - Okay. - "Okay"? I thought you'd be thrilled. - I am. If you can prove Chau's embezzling money, you'll definitely get the front page. - Either way, be careful. - I will. Chau's bank can't trace this back to us, right? Don't worry. I always scrub everything clean when I go in the backdoor. A CHAY PAWN SHOP 8 BILLION VND PHUC TRAVEL AGENCY 3 BILLION VND WHO IS NGUYEN VAN BINH? AGENT AMNESIA, YOU MIGHT NEED THIS Who are you people? I don't have much money. There are deliveries to be made. Boss needs you back at work. What are you saying? Enough with the charade. Get to Phuc's travel agency. He's waiting for you. Don't make us come back here. Phuc travel agency… Stop! Go back. - How much? - 578,000 VND. - That much? - We've been driving around for hours! Here. No delivery? What? I'm supposed to deliver this to HQ, right? Hurry up. - Are you my partner? - I'm in a rush. Then tell me who I am. You sunglasses thief! You really wanna know? You're a conman! A good-for-nothing goon! A rotten, pathetic gangster! Go back and tell Dung that I quit! KHANH HOI BRIDGE Oh, shipper! Don't let anyone stop you. AGENT AMNESIA, WHAT'S UP? YOU DIDN'T TEXT THIS MORNING. VAN'S FATHER ALSO A VICTIM? My father and I had our issues. But it was only after he died that I realized how precious he was. It's me. - What are you doing here? - Please, I need your help. - Van! - Yes! Yes? Well, Bo's condition keeps getting worse. Tell the nurses to set him straight. If he keeps raising hell, he'll ruin everything. Okay, I'll handle it. You always put me at ease. - Van… - Yes? When I look at you, I just want to… have a daughter like you. You're like family to me. But right now, the patients need you. I'll come by your office later. DOCTOR PHAN NGOC VAN I have proof that Chau killed my father. - That's impossible. - Don't believe me? Here. Chau's financial records. He's been embezzling the asylum's donation money. How did you get these? He killed whoever found out by changing their medication. Including your father. Don't you love him? Get out, or I'll call the police! From one daughter to another, I hope that you'll help me. Please eat, sir. It's my first time cooking. Try the spinach. I hope it's not too salty. If you don't mind my saying, sir, your daughter is an amazing woman. She's the kindest person I've ever met, and a caring doctor to boot. And yet that wasn't enough for you… I forbid you. A woman should put family above career! - But it's my choice! - You dare talk back to me? If mom were alive, she'd support me. I will never accept this! Dad… I once felt so safe by your side. But after Mom died… everything changed. That night I found you on the street… I was so scared. I thought I couldn't take it anymore. I wish I had treated you better. Taken better care of you. I should have answered your calls. I'm so sorry, Dad. What if I'm not a good person? And I don't deserve you? Could you accept me? AGENT AMNESIA, THERE'S DURIAN IN THE FRIDGE What happened to you, Binh? My name is Binh? Everything you need to know is at my place. Oh God… Don't tell me this guy's my boyfriend! So that's how it is. I'm not a special agent… Just a criminal. More like a low-level goon. But also my best friend. You know how I lost my memory? - Well... - I must've done something bad, right? But I'm different now. I'm a new man. Right! But let me finish... Finish what? If I tell her the truth, I'll lose her. She just needs a good man. I'll become one for her! Stay out of it. Don't ruin my chances with the doctor, okay?! Doctor? She's a journalist! Binh! Binh! I'M SORRY I LIED TO YOU. I'M NOT ACTUALLY A PSYCHOLOGIST. You okay? Yeah… I'm just lost. At first, I thought I knew how this case would end. But now… It's not so simple. I'm here if you need me. Loan. It's done. - Here's who you're looking for. - Thank you. NGUYEN VAN BINH Loan, I got this for your dad. Doctor Loan? DOCTOR CHAU - DISTRICT 5 PAWN SHOP MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS WHO ARE HIS ACCOMPLICES? THE AMNESIA GOON, WHO'S HE WORKING FOR? HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE PUBLISH ARTICLES ON THESE PAGES GET NEWS FOR THESE PAGES So it was all a lie. You want to know the truth? My father was murdered. Binh… You were involved in his death. You got it wrong. I was just a shipper. Don't use me anymore. Loan loves you. I'm sure of it. - She loves the Binh who had amnesia. - That's still you. Can I become that person again? If you want to. Shit, they're gonna kill Loan! Where are you going? Hey! Quit imagining things. In reality, it'd be like this… Hey! See? Let me handle it. I'll hold them off. You wake up the neighborhood. Dogs will bark. Cats will meow. Mice will squeak. And if not… then it's our funeral. Miss! There's a huge fight going on! Miss. Miss. Some people are fighting! They're fighting and killing each other! Morning exercise? It's too dark out. No. Wake your family up. Got it? Okay, go ahead. The bathroom's that way. You slut! I caught you red-handed! You ditched me to hook up with this tramp?! You're into bald chicks, aren't you? Who's this bitch? Don't tell me you're cheating again. Babe, calm down… Please, I'm begging you. Bark loudly! Woof! Come on. Don't just pant. Help me out. Bark! Babe, I don't know who this bitch is. I swear there's no one else. Who are you? I've never seen you before. You asshole!

I only bang you! Wait up! Baby! How did you do that? Luckily for me, they have a beautiful love. Let's go home. Loan isn't done with them yet. Give me a few days, boss. I'll reunite her with her father. MEDICAL RECORD NX, TWICE A DAY MINH PRESCRIPTION RECORD PHAN BANG AGENT AMNESIA Thanks for helping me recover my memory. Other than cash, I also delivered something in very cold boxes. Be careful. Before I reveal the truth, get far away from here. I don't want you to be caught up in this. I've booked you a plane ticket. Crazier! Crazier! Crazier! - The final chapter will reveal the truth! - What? In the end, I will prevail because I'm Bo… James Bo! Don't worry, your husband will be fine. Okay. Van. Look. Currently, 22 patients are taking NX. Any one of them could be next. Please take me to the morgue to examine the bodies. My God! I just saw Chau drag Bo down to surgery. It's just like you said. We have to call the cops! There's no time. Come on! Hello, captain! Keep him still. Quit squirming! Stop! Release James Bo! An impeccable twist at the darkest hour! It's over. Security! Find a place to lock him up. - Who are you? - He's my captain. So many patients have died from this. But today… you will pay! - This is poison, isn't it? - It's muscle relaxant, you fools! - What? - Look. Get it now? Liar! What about the hotels and prostitutes? Who are you calling a prostitute? Look closely. She's my wife! The meds are kicking in. - Where's Bo? - They're probably in the back. Be careful. - So you didn't change the medication? - I just sign the papers. Someone else handles the medicine. Leave him to me. Go catch his accomplices, captain. PHUC TRAVEL AGENCY Van! Say hi to Daddy! Daddy, you're about to have a new friend! She's a detective. You killed my father. You killed them all. Took their organs. Even your own father… Why? Because I'm daddy's perfect little girl, just like he wanted. An excellent surgeon… just like he wanted. But I never got to do what I wanted! Only in death could he see what a perfect surgeon I'd become! You dare mess with the boss? Let her go! Pick on someone your own size! - Stop, or I'll shoot! - Without a gun? You're crazy. A paperclip? I was scared for a minute. Listen to me. You're not James Bo. Drop it. You're bleeding. Loan, careful! Loan! I thought you wanted to join the gang. I'm on her side now! Number four! Stance four! Here goes nothing! Hello? Police? I'm at Duc Chau Asylum. Chau's trafficking organs. He's trying to kill me. Please come quick! Help me! Is anyone there? Help me! Is anyone there? Help me! - Van! What's going on? - Save me! Save me! It's Chau… Van! I loved you like my own daughter! He wants me! He forced me to do it! Now that he's caught, he wants to kill me! Save me! You have no proof. Everything's under Chau's name. You've got nothing on me. Bitch! He… He raped me. Why did you…? Lock that witch up! Why isn't anyone doing anything?! Come on, everyone! Crazier! Crazier! Crazier! Crazier! They can't stop you… but I can. I'll tell the police everything. Are you insane, shipper? If you confess, you'll be locked up too. So be it. Let's see you talk now! Captain! We won! Sorry, we cannot salute properly here. Binh! Let's go. ORGAN TRAFFICKING RING SHUT DOWN Binh… I don't know how to put into words all the things I feel inside. You appeared in my life so suddenly, and left just as swiftly. But since we parted, there hasn't been a single day that I haven't thought of you. I know that night when you came to my room you were just trying to make sure I was okay. And I will never forget that evening, when you helped me erase all the pain from my father that I held deep inside. All those awards that once seemed so important, are now meaningless compared to that night we spent by the fountain. Even though you could have left, you came back and sacrificed yourself to help me find the truth. I'm so sorry for using you. I hope you can forgive me for all my mistakes. I don't know how many times I've imagined a different future. But no one can know what lies ahead. Perhaps we'll never meet again. And the years will wipe away all these feelings. But this I know for sure… You'll always be the one I won't forget to remember. Loan. PRISON It's been two years. You can't expect her to wait. There's plenty of fish in the sea. A handsome guy like you with a decent job, girls will be lining up. My uncle's still hiring. He's still selling motorbikes? No. After coronavirus, he switched to face masks. The office has a lot of single ladies. Are they cute? Cute, huh? Oh, did I hurt you? It's been so long. Are you mad? Not at all. I just thought you forgot about me. Do you know how hard it was for me to set this up? You're in love. Stop being so shy! Are you done? You should at least be holding hands... Huh? You're kissing?! Hey! Only kissing, okay? I'm selling this car! No hanky-panky. Okay fine, go nuts. 20 YEARS LATER… I'm so relieved! I've finally cured you. Brought you back to your original self. The novelist Phan Bang. You're the best psychiatrist I've ever known. - You're too kind. - It's true! I was in deep cover as a mental patient, yet you saw right through me. What? When the need arises, I will become a novelist, a doctor, an architect, a baby, a woman, an actor, or a teacher. But the truth is, I am Special Agent Bo… James Bo! So that's how it is… Hold on. - Why don't we go back inside? - What's wrong? A patient has just been sexually harassed. - He bought it. - I must act crazy again! What are you doing? Not just insane like before, but a pervert too! Oh no… Should I take off my underwear?
