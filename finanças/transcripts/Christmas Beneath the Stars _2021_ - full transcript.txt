Come on, let's go inside. We'll get the rest of your gear later. Okay. I missed you! Oh, I missed you too. Wow, there are some winning photos in here. Too bad. Wait, too bad? What do you mean, too bad? Too bad because I'm skipping the competition this year. What? Why? Because I am going to Alaska with you. Really? Oh, Aunt Lucy, I would love that. But are you sure? I'm sure. I enjoy decorating, but spending time with you is half the fun. I feel the same way. Besides, you didn't think I would let you celebrate the holidays all by yourself? Even if you are the Christmas Guru. Not for a minute. Is this where we're going? Yes, it is. Okay. Nestled in the heart of the Alaskan wilderness, Christmas World is a true fairy tale if there ever was one. Let's read some reviews. No, I never read reviews, not before I write one. I don't want it to influence me. You're good. Okay, escape to a magical land where Santa comes every year, and a helpful elf is around every corner.

Why? Just wondering. Wondering? Wondering about looking past the sad stuff to the potential. You remember what my house used to look like before we started on our decorating ideas. I know, but it wasn't this... Well, it wasn't this. It was pretty bad that first year. And yet we made it work. In fact, we won. We won because of creatively framed photography. ♪♪♪ Here?

And then he let go of staff to cut costs, turned off the electricity early to reduce expenses. And he raised rent on some of the retail spaces, but folks just moved out. What was he thinking? He was just trying to make it profitable again. Again? It's been a while. Wish you'd told me. Maybe I could have come back in earlier. That's exactly why I didn't tell you. You have your own life.

Hmm, it's been so good having you home, Ben. Feels good to be home. So do you think your makeover plan is going to work? Yeah, I do think so. I think we just need a strong marketing push, you know? Don't you? There are some things that you don't know, Ben. What do you mean? If you're going to be upset with someone, you should be mad at me. You, but...? I'm the one that gave the agreement to Ben. I thought we should take it. But that was before. I assure you, Ben has no intention of selling this place. In fact, he begged me for the chance to save it. He did? Yeah, he did. After seeing how you and Lucy, and everyone else is so invested in the village's success, I don't want to sell it now either. I think I just forgot how special this place is. I'm sorry. I guess I should probably go talk to Ben. Yeah. Thank you. You know, ever since we were kids, we always said we were going to run this place together. Yeah, yeah, I know we did say that, didn't we? We could finally make that dream happen now. And I could help you. Gretta. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Gretta. I'm sorry, we talked about this years ago when I left. I know, but I think that now... No, I don't feel the same way about you. I thought I made that clear. Uh... So, so you're choosing her over me? I'm sorry. You know, you're... You're a fool, Ben. Why don't you just do us all a favor and sell out to Ashtor, okay? Gretta, no! Hey! Gretta! Morning, sunshine. How did it go? What did Ben say? You know, I didn't get a chance to talk to him. He was busy. Busy? Too busy to talk to you? Yeah. Listen, Lucy, I don't think I can stay. You're leaving? Now? Yeah, now, I think. What about your review? You know, I already started it, I think I'm just going to finish the rest on the plane. We still have lots to do, and I promised Warren that we would... I know. You know what, you should stay? Yeah, you should stay, and... I mean, we have the room until New Years, right? It's already paid for. You should stay and decorate the town if that's what you want to do. But I, I just think... I just think... ♪♪♪ I don't know what I was thinking.

Oh, that girl's never gotten over you. What if Hannah saw? She saw more than that. She saw the Ashtor agreement in your bag last night. That explains it! Oh Ben, I've made so many mistakes.

I'm sure she'd be very impressed with you. Abner! Pardon me a moment. The restrooms in the station are bigger than your place in Manhattan, am I right? Abner! Oh! This is the first laugh I've had in months, I think. Then I'm glad you're here. Me too! Best bagels in New York. You remembered. Oh, I've missed you. Same here. But I can't believe you got me to do this crazy trek again. You know it makes me sad every time I visit, seeing the town decline. I think you'll be very surprised this year. Well, I hope so, old friend. Now, let me introduce you to the very impressive young woman responsible for the transformation with her aunt. She's unfortunately leaving us too soon. Hi, I'm Hannah Reed. Very nice to meet you, Hannah. I'm Catherine. Wait, Catherine Moore? Yes, last I checked. As in the Catherine Moore of Discovery Wild? Yes. You're right, Abner, she is impressive. Is that Nikon? Are you a photographer? Ben said you were an avid photographer. Yeah, I am a photographer. You know, I actually just captured a series of the Auroras here. I really think you'd love them. You're right, I would. I have a passion for those beauties. Unfortunately, Hannah has a flight to catch. Oh, that's too bad. I love getting to know new photographers' work. If you stay a bit longer, maybe we could all grab lunch. What do you say, Hannah? ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ What else have you been shooting while you've been here? Well, I just downloaded this card.

Gretta, why did you say it's too late? What's the matter, Warren? You've both been fooled this entire time. Aren't you going to say anything, Mr. Locke? ♪♪♪ I didn't know how to tell him, or how to tell you. Tell us what? He took out a loan and used Christmas World as collateral just to stay afloat. It's time to pay up, and if he doesn't, Ashtor's going to purchase it from the bank for pennies on the dollar. ♪♪♪ When were you going to tell me, Dad? ♪♪♪ How much? ♪♪♪ How much, Dad? He owes $100,000, paid in full by Saturday. ♪♪♪ All the land beneath Christmas World is mine. Well, belongs to Ashtor, but he's my cousin, so... That's why you were sabotaging our plans. Sabotaging? I found proof in my pictures. He's in the background messing with the electrical, with the fixture that fell. Why, Mark? Money, custody battle. Look, I set up a nice deal with Ashtor so your dad wouldn't lose everything. Everything was going according to plan until you. You just had to do your job, and write one bad review. I thought once I showed you the place, it'd be an easy sell. What are you talking about? It was you, the anonymous client. You were writing a review? I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you, but I have to stay anonymous to get an unbiased review. It's not just any review, Ben, no. No, she is the Christmas Guru, the make or break of holiday places. I only found out because Oscar accidentally left her name on an email he forwarded me, telling me the review was ready. Stupid agents. I didn't even have to read the piece. The title said it all, "The Magic of Christmas World 2.0." It was for you, the best kind of marketing. That review was supposed to be the final nail in the coffin for Christmas World. No, every year I just keep thinking this place is going to die, and every year it just keeps on eking by because certain folks can't seem to let it go. Stupid saps. You sign the paperwork? ♪♪♪ What paperwork? ♪♪♪ Ashtor's going to buy the restaurant. But doesn't Warren own all the land here? Not this parcel, it's been in her family for generations. Gretta, don't do this. If Christmas World goes down, the café can't survive. Mark made me an honest offer, and with that money I can start over somewhere else comfortably. This place is your family's legacy. Your cooking is the heart of Christmas World. You can't leave. Ben, what part of "you lost' don't you understand?" Your dad has to come up with $100,000 by tomorrow to save this place. Come on. ♪♪♪ Well, I have some money saved up that I could invest. It's not a ton, Warren, but it's yours. Oh Lucy, are you sure you want to get into business with a fool like me? You must know by now how much I love Christmas, Warren. And I could not live with myself if I let your Christmas World go and there was something I could do to help. I have some saved up too. ♪♪♪ So do I, Dad. ♪♪♪ Count me in.
