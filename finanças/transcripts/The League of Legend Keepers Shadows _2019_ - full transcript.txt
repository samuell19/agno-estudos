(liquid pouring) (clink) (suspenseful music) - Maps. They're magical things. They can lead you to places you've never been but they can also show you new ways of getting to places you think you know. My name is Sophie Carson. My family's been to so many places on the map that you'd think we wouldn't need one by now. Edward Carson, archeologist, leader of our tribe. Hunter and gatherer. Katie Carson, queen of the Carson clan and world class map reader. Aramus, Armenia, the Baba Temple in Bahrain and Xinjiang, China, all places we've followed Dad looking for the Holy Grail. I'm not joking. My father's life work has been to find five pendants. When worn around the neck, they bring great power and wealth. But like all magic, that comes with a price. A life's work for Dad and Mom and me and oh yes. Emma, mini me. Not. How can your own sister have an American accent when we're all English? I'll tell you how. A life lived traveling, that's how. Anyway, we've trekked, wandered, strayed off the goat trail as they say Zalabiye, Syria. Why don't I tell you about the legend that my family has been chasing? The one that has led us back to Emma's birthplace? Sunny California. (dramatic music) Before books, before Scriptures, there were legends, whispered stories of pendants. Rare jewels from the five walked upon lands that gave the owner the power of darkness and immortality. In ancient times the holder was a queen. Queen Lily Bethany of the West, mother of all sand tribes. But one winter her only son became ill, very ill. A breath away from death, his mother had no choice. She turned to the dark shadow from the south. Ohanzee. Ohanzee promised Queen Lily Bethany that he would save her first born. He would free her son from the shadows of death in exchange for the pendants. Queen Lily Bethany hesitantly accepted his deal, allowing Ohanzee the power of her son's soul. Ohanzee tore the shadow of death from the boy and took the pendants. However, there were only four, not the five needed to grant him the powers of the Holy Grail. He grew angry and cursed his shadows and fire upon the sand tribes. Burning their villages and cursing them to eternal darkness. Finally, unleashing his new power, he killed the boy and his mother with the very shadows he'd promised to remove. It is said that this was the very beginnings between light and darkness. And he had skulls all over his body. - Ow. - Sophie. - How's she ever going to learn the good stuff? Are we there yet? - Are we there yet? - We've been driving for hours. - We've been driving for hours. - Stop it. - Stop it. - You're always copying me. - You're always copying me. - Girls, stop it. - Yay, starting a new school in the middle of the year. I liked India. - I didn't. - You'll be fine, Sophie, besides. What could possibly go wrong in this place? - [Katie] Look girls, palm trees. Oh, it's just like Cairo. - [Edward] Yes, with slightly better toilets. Okay. - See kids? It's really nice. - [Edward] Come on now, out you get. (high whine) - [Eddie] Mom, I'm gonna be a scientist just like you. - Eddie? If you don't get to school on time, bud, no science camp. I mean it, huh? - [Eddie] Oh (coughs) so stinky. (somber music) (explosion bangs) (high whine) Oh, not again! - [Katie] This is where they're putting us up. - Whoa. - No it's good, hey. - Yeah. - Let's go put our stuff in our rooms. - I hope there are no evil spirits here, Emma. (somber music) (car horns beep) - Buddy. I'm not gonna ask again. - I'm almost finished. There's never enough time. Okay. Let's do this. - See, it's not so bad here? Good neighborhood. - Okay. - Great view. (laughs) (high whine) (explosion rumbles) (groans) - Flaming balls of smoke. (smoke detector bleeps) Smoke! Smoke, um. That's the smoke detector going off, I can't even, oh. Ah. - [Katie] Sophie, Sophie, hurry up, darling, you'll be later for your new school! - [Sophie] (spits) Coming. - [Edward] Sophie, I have to be at the dig by nine so you'll have to walk to school today. - [Sophie] Oh, my book. - I'm gonna be late darling. Okay, okay, sorry about that. Darling, the toilet isn't working. - Edward. - Well it wasn't me. - I wish I could get her to move like that. And I guess you broke another toilet again. - Well, I can neither confirm nor deny that. - See you later. - Bye honey. - Bye darling. - Have a great first day. She's growing up so fast. - So fast. - She never tells me bye. - Bye Emma, get a room. - Maybe she's got an idea. - You're gonna be late, it's your first day. - No you're right, I've gotta go. - Go (laughs). - I love you. - Love you too. - Bye. - Bye. - Good luck. - Give me that. - Two explosions in less than 24 hours, that's gotta be a record of some sort. - On the bright side, I haven't blown up the house. Yet (laughs). - Are you an inventor? - I try to be. Although, some of the experiments are better than others. - I'm Sophie. - I'm Edison. - Nice to meet you Edison. - [Edison] Nice to meet you too. - So what were the explosions you were doing? (phone rings) - You've reached Travis Jackson at Digs Are Us, please leave your name and message after the tone. - Oh hi, Travis, this is Doctor Carson. I'm running a bit behind this morning and could be there shortly. I could use some coffee. Looking forward to meeting you, old chap. Good morning, old chap, how's it going? - Old chap. - Never mind that, I'm sure it's great. All good in the hood as they say. Tell me, where's the coffee? - Yes, good morning, sir. By the way everything is as you requested. It's such an honor to be working with you. Such an honor. I just can't believe it's in our home town here, it's cool, in fact. - Yes, yes, quite incredible. You know what else is incredible? Coffee. Strong, black coffee. Would you be a good lad and maybe go get me some? - Good lad, sure, I'd love to. - Thank you. - BRB. - BRB. - Be right back. Here you are, sir. - Okay, right so, continue digging here. - Yeah, but, Sir. - No, no, no, it's here. - It's a hundred yards away, it can't be. Can't be here. - Did you perhaps grab some creamer? - What's that? - Creamer. - Creamer? - Creamer? - Creamer. - Creamer. - I thought you said you liked your coffee strong and black. - No no, I do, I do, but. I also like creamer. Thank you. - Sure. - [Edward] Thank you. - You've got to be kidding me. (groans) - Doctor Carson? It is a pleasure. - Please, call me Edward. - Of course. I am Zilbid. - Ah, he that is strong. - I am impressed. - Yes, well, I know a few languages - I as well. I work for the museum's cultural expert. I'm here to assist with the dig. We are all very excited to be a part of this project. - Thank you, Zilbid. How long have you been with the museum? - It feels like a lifetime. It appears you are close to finding the last pendant. - Yes well, if all goes well, that's the plan. - I'm at your service, Edward. - Okay. - Old chap? - Ah, thank you. No, no, no, needs sugar. Thank you. - Sugar. It does need sugar. - [Edward] Yes, okay. (children scream) (bell rings) - [Eddie] So you just moved in last night, right? - Yeah, what were you doing in your garage? - Oh, I was just working on something. My dad has me do all my experiments out of the house, just for safety. - Hey, have you finished my homework yet? - No, I have a couple more questions to do. - Wrong answer. Have you finished my homework yet. - It's algebra, it's the, you have all the equations and the data problems. My brain's gonna blow up. - Your future depends on you getting my work done. - Okay, okay, third period. - Nice bow tie. Who do you think you are, Benjamin Franklin? (laughs) - Nice face, not. - Oh, we got a live one here. - Do not make eye contact. Don't. - You're a jerk and you two are idiots. - What are you doing? - Are you new? - Uh, you all need to apologize. - I do? - Yes, you do. - Johnny don't apologize. - Neither does Stuart. - Danni don't apologize either. - I hope you're not doing their English homework too. - You need to learn your role at my school. - Our school. - Or else you'll be doing my homework. - And mine. - Hey kids, what's shaking? - Why, you look different this year, Mr. Swaski. - Yeah, I lost a few pounds. I'm looking lean and mean now, huh? You know what's not shaking, me. You guys are gonna be behaving yourselves this week, right? Is everybody gonna go to the Halloween party. - I don't know, maybe. - Maybe? What's your name. - Sophie Carson. - You must be new here, Sophie, welcome to our little town. It's the best party around (high ting). - It is, isn't it Edison? (laughs) - Look at him. - That's a story for another time. (high ting) - You still teach here? - Substitute. You're the lunch man. - Who's ever heard of a lunch man? - Yeah, well, I can still send you to the principal's office. You settle down and get back to work. - Oh, um, so, I'm sorry, we're sorry and I just wanted to give this to you. There, see? Hey. I'm really sorry. (bell rings) (door clangs) - Good morning, Class 5C. Please take a seat, or not, if you wanna learn that way. I'm going to be grading you as a group today so Ellen, you may begin. - Nobody knew how the curse started or how to stop it until a shaman came into their village. - He was an evil, evil man and he cursed the first born of the original owner of the pendants and with her blood and his scepter, he could summon his first love through the shadows but in the chaos, he lost the pendants. - The legend says the pendants when all together possess extreme power. It's the only way he can ever find his true love again. - It's just a stupid legend. - That remains to be seen, Johnny. So does anyone know how the shaman can find his love again? - The peak of the super moon lunar eclipse. - A blood moon. - Correct. Sophie, why don't you come on up, tell us why you're here, we're so glad to have you. Come on. Don't be shy, come on now. - Hi, I just came from India where my parents were on a dig and they were looking for a scepter which once belonged to an evil medicine man and they found the scepter. - Huh, I always wondered if witch doctors were real. - I can answer that, Miss Turner. They are real. - Nerd. (everyone laughs) - Quiet class, this is your one and only warning, Johnny. - Yeah, for like the fifth time. - Hey. (crowd groans) You can have a seat, thank you so much. So, a super lunar eclipse is a very rare event. Does anyone know how many times a century this happens? - It happens four times a century. - Great, and what makes this so special? - The moon appears much larger than normal. - You're right as well. Does anyone else now why? - It's at the perigee. - Sophie, you keep amazing me. You girls may have a seat, thank you. The moon is at its closest point to the Earth and this is called a super moon. This is the eclipse when the moon, the Earth and the sun are all aligned. The Earth's shadow falls on the moon which causes the sun to glow bright red. There will be a test on this, Johnny. Can we please have our next group, I'm so excited to hear. Thank you. Good job, Sophie. (high whine) (low rumble) (pen scribbles) (squeals) - Hello, Miss Turner. - My god. - I need your assistance, Miss Turner. - How'd you get in here? - There is nothing to be afraid of. Not yet. - Who are you? - (speaks foreign language) Do as I command and you will remain human. - What? (somber music) - [Edward] There's my baby. - I'll be damned. (eerie music) - We need to secure the site. - Yes sir. (slow music) (door clicks) - Are you still staring at those creepy things? - This is my life's work. - [Katie] I know, I think it's cute. - You think these things are creepy? - (laughs) I'm about to take it off. (cars rumble) (dramatic music) (Emma hums) (Emma hums) - You go here and I go there. (high scream) (dramatic music) - Hey, I wanted to tell you. I wanted to tell you, are you okay? - I think I saw a ghost. - Do you need a Scooby snack? - I'm serious. - Those cartoons are way too scary for you. I wanted to tell you that we have guests over tomorrow night so I need you to be on your best behavior, okay? Who am I kidding, you're six. Do you want me to leave the light on? - I don't know, will you stay with me? - Ah, you're so sweet. Of course I won't, goodnight. (low growl) (gasps) (bell rings) - Wait, if you sit with me, you'll be a social outcast forever. - Seems like I already am. So what are you up to? - Oh its just a prototype, nothing special. - I love Miss Turner, she's my new favorite teacher. That lesson was amazing. - Yeah, Miss Turner's really obsessed with that story. - It's actually really interesting. - Oh, yeah, really like it. - Really? - Yeah, absolutely. - Nerd alert. - Someone thought it'd be a funny idea to stink bomb me. - And what does that have to do with us? - Your loser boyfriend. - He's not my boyfriend. - Oh, too fast to respond there. - Well, he put one in my shirt. You little runt, you're dead. - Dead. You hear? - Oh, hey, what is that I hear? It sounded like a little echo. - I know, I heard that too, like that buzzing noise. - Oh yeah, what was that? - Don't you have something stupid to say. - (scoffs) No. - You better watch it. Revenge his sweet, you little witch. (group laughs) - Miss Turner, thank you for suggesting this, that we all get together, it was great idea. I think it's a wonderful way to meet Sophie's history teacher and our neighbor, so I hope you don't mind we invited young Thomas to join us. - Uh, I don't mind, and you made my favorite. - Oh. (can sprays) - Emma. Where are your manners? - In my pocket. - That's quite all right Emma. I can take some if you don't mind, thank you. - Well, I have to tell you, a home cooked meal. - Oh. - Unbelievable. - Lovely stuff. - The pie wasn't really mine but it's not bad. - You know I love this stuff, don't you? - Don't do it. - Do what? - Edward, manners. - I'm not doing anything. (can squishes) - You're. (people chatter) - Family tradition, I'm afraid. - Thank you, family tradition - Uh, oh, family tradition. Come on, remember. - Hit me. (laughs) - Oh uh, well, I guess when in Rome, huh? (can squishes) (laughs) - That was a lot, Dad! - It's gonna go everywhere. - Go on Miss Turner. (group yells) - Go on, Miss Turner. - Come on! (laughs) - I was not expecting that. - I was not. - [Sophie] I didn't think she was actually gonna do it. - She went for it. - That is commitment, commitment. That is commitment and a half. - Whipped cream, I'm all for that. - That is amazing. - Everywhere. All in your hair. - Young lady, I think it's time we got you to bed. Do you want to play with your shadow puppets for a few minutes? - Nope. - Goodnight Emma. - Oh, it's so good. - [Thomas] Look at you, you just went for it. - So where's your mom? Sorry, bad question? - [Miss Turner] And yes, I'll be at the Halloween party. - My mom disappeared when I was four. She was the best inventor. She invented all kinds of things. - It should be fun. Have you given any thought to your costume yet? - I've given more thought to my costume than my speech. - Do you want your dad to remarry or meet someone else? - Let me guess, archeologist. - Bond, James Bond. - Oh. - I guess it would be okay. - (laughs) I like it, I get to be a Bond girl. - OH, I like that. - I want him to be happy and if someone makes him happy then I guess that's okay. - What's your costume, Miss Turner? - I don't know really, I haven't thought about it. - Well I've got some ideas, if you're interested. - Yes, I'm up for ideas, I have to use the bathroom, do you? - Oh yeah, use the one in our bedroom, this one isn't working. - Thanks, excuse me. - [Katie] Someone's got a crush. - It's time for a crush, right? - Yeah. - Everyone was doing it, right? (liquid squishes) - Besides, I'm not the only one around here with a crush. (dramatic music) - As you were. (laughs) (high whine) (deep bang) - Everything come out okay? - What? - Sorry, sorry. - Fine, just fine, I'm not really feeling too good, I'm gonna have to call it a night but thank you so much, everything was amazing. - Sorry that you're leaving so soon. I hope everything's okay. - Thanks for coming. - It will be. - Really grateful for your interest in the pendants, it really means a lot to me, well us. - Thank you, see you soon. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Oh, bye. - She likes you. (laughs) (car door bangs) (pendants rattle) (high screech) (dramatic rumble) (screams) (car beeps) - You were just gonna leave? - Yes, I have to go, I don't feel well. - Look, let's go to that Halloween party together, huh? It'll be fun and god knows you need a date god knows I need one too. - That would be great, look, I don't wanna give you the wrong impression, I like you, I really do, I just got some weird stuff going on right now. - Oh, well look, if you ever wanna talk about it, my door's always. - Tomorrow, I'll call you I can't right now, thank you. - Okay. (car screeches) Okay, I just, guess call me, right? - That was a fun night. Honey. - Mmm? - Do you know where my picture is? - I don't know. - Oh. (bell rings) (gum chews) - So I guess we'll see you guys at he party, huh, nerds? - Considering my dad's the guest of honor, I would think so. - Oh, you're some big shot, aren't ya? - Big shot. - Big shot. - Why do you even hang out with him anyway? - Hey, you know, you better shut up or I'm gonna make you pay. - Make me pay, for your zit cream? You don't scare anyone except your reflection in the mirror, what you are is mean and bitter. - Hey. That's enough. You three, Principal's office, now. Now. - You better watch it. - Watch it. - Watch it. - Oh my gosh, Sophie, he is going to kill you. - Bring it on. - [Reporter] And tonight on Channel Nine News, we have a special event in downtown Hermosa where Professor Edward Carson is unveiling the two and a half thousand year old amulets which were discovered recently at the school grounds at Hermosa High. - Miss Mayor can I get a moment I just have a few questions. - Well of course you can, darling, I always have time to speak to the media. - Awesome well, this event is just amazing once again. The atmosphere is just electric. I mean look at all these people all in costumes. - Quick, we don't wanna get noticed. - Guys, if Mr. Swaski sees us, we're gonna be in real big trouble. - Oh, he's just gonna send us to the principal's office and we won't actually go (laughs). - So what can you tell us about the announcement? I mean there's a lot of speculation over this archeological dig, so what can you tell us? - Well, there will be a very big announcement tonight but also people will be able to get a chance to experience a spectacular lunar eclipse I mean a super blood moon. - Hey, relax. Let's have fun, huh? - You'll just have to stick around and see, handsome. - Sounds good. - Well, they're having fun. Come on. - Did you see what Sophie was wearing? - Yeah, who was she supposed to be? - Her dad. (laughs) Okay guys, now come on, quick, now we need to get to phase two of Halloween Hell. - Really? Is that the best you could come up with? It's shadow shape shifting time. - Still a terrible name. (laughs) - You want that. Thank you. - God, I'm glad I'm here. I'm glad I'm here for you tonight. - Are you? - Yes, I know. - Are you ready for this? - I'm ready for this I am, how do I look? - Handsome as always. - I think you're more nervous than I am. - I'm just worried about Emma. New town, new babysitter and don't you think there's something not quite right about that guy or am I going mad? - No, no, no, she'll be fine, I promise. Okay? - Okay. - My notes, I need my notes for the. - Hey, you got this. (crowd applauds) - What a great party. How's everyone feeling, a good night so far? - Yeah. - Yeah! - It's a great party, but, don't forget keep your eye on the sky. ¶ Used to be together ¶ (soft piano music) - Wow, I had no idea. - Me neither. - Uh. Are you okay, it's just, you've been acting kinda strange all night. - I'm just not feeling myself tonight. - Oh, ah. Do you wanna go or? - No, not at all, I'm sorry, please just excuse me for a minute. - Okay well, I'll. Be right here. (soft piano music) (door bangs) (dramatic music) - Where did she go? - I don't know. - Danni? - Danni? - Danni, where are you? (deep rumble) (speaks foreign language) (gasps) (screams) - What are you doing here? - I saw something, I don't know what it was, but I saw something. - That was you playing the piano. - No, yes, but I saw a shadow moving. I swear, I did. (gasps) - What did I do, what did I do, what did I do, what did I do, this can't be happening, this can't be happening. - What's she talking about? - Leave me alone! - We've got to help her. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Leave me alone, I did what you asked, leave me alone, you said I would be okay you gave me your word. - We gotta get out of here. (gasps) (deep laugh) (screams) - Blood moon. (speaks foreign language) - Miss Turner, what are you doing with that guy? He's 12 feet tall. - Run, run, run! - Dude, your costume's completely rad. - You have to run. - No thanks. (screams) - Go. - Freshmen. (electric sparks) - Oh, hey, uh, where have you been, we've all been a little worried. - Number three. (laughs) (low whine) (screams) (laughs) - I didn't mean run and leave me. - Sorry. (laughs) - Well, well, look who it is. - Come on, we need to go now - Are you with them now, Danni? - Yes, and we've gotta go, these shadows. - Oh shadows, you mean like these shadows. - Ugh. (laughs) - They're, they're. - Oh, scared of your own shadow? - No, I'm scared of his. - This doesn't scare me. - I'm really disappointed in you, Danni. What are you even running from, it's an illusion. - Yes, I mean no, we've gotta go. These shadows. - I'd like to introduce, Mr. Edward Carson. (crowd applauds) (crowd cheers) - Thank you, thank you. Well, first and foremost, I would like to thank my wife. She's my crown jewel, I mean how did a guy like me end up with her? (door bangs) (screams) (deep rumble) - It's an illusion (laughs) - This doesn't scare me. - Oh, so scary, looks so real. - Yeah, how did you do that? - She's supported me, well us, while we spanned the globe in search of these magnificent ancient treasures. (deep rumble) - Yeah, right. (laughs) He's not that scary. - And tonight, to have all the pendants together for the first time in over 2500 years is quite simply amazing. And all within view of this absolutely incredible spectacle, a total lunar eclipse, accompanied by a super blood moon, how about that ladies and gentlemen? (crowd applauds) How about that? (deep rumble) (laughs) (crowd screams) - These wonderful people, fulfilling a lifelong dream of mine, one my family followed me on. (growls) (screams) (gasps) - Their power, according to legend has the power to swallow worlds, forever trapped. (high scream) (gasps) (chokes) (high whine) - Unbelievable. - Where's Sophie? = She's with Edison. (high whine) (high scratch) (screams) - Sophie! - We have to go now, the shadows, they're here! (crowd screams) (crowd yells) - Dad! - Dad, dad, the shadows, they're coming! - We've got an evacuation here. (deep rumble) - Everyone needs to leave. Now. (high scratch) - How did he get my scepter? - It's not yours, it's his. (chokes) (deep rumble) - I'm no longer interested. - Go, now, everybody, go, go, go! (crowd screams) (deep rumble) - Come on! (screams) (chokes) - Run! - Go, go, go, go! (doors bang) - [Thomas] Go go go, come on, go, come on! Get out, get out. - We've got an evacuation here we got a situation! (lightning crackles) Go go, go. (deep rumble) - [Thomas] Come on, Eddie. You got it. (deep growl) - What is this place? - Good evening. (gasps) - Who are you, you scared us to death. - No time for questions, I'll explain as we get further through the tunnel, let's go, come on, follow me. - Where are your parents? - We don't have parents, we live in the foster home. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - Stuart lived there with us. I can't believe he's gone now. You guys are lucky to have parents. - You are indeed. Hear me now, I need Sophie, I need Edison, Thomas, Edward and Katie to come with me. Johnny, you and Danni go that way. It goes to outside. - It goes to the outside. We've got to get Emma. - Emma's safe, she's at our base. - Base? What the hell is going on here? We need to get Emma. And what do you mean she's okay? - Your babysitter, he's one of us. Johnny, Danni, good luck. This is the end of the road for you, it's nothing personal. - Nothing personal? You're sending us down into a black tunnel of death. - No, not going down there. - Me neither. - [Sophie] If they go, we all go, and I mean all of us. - She said all of us. - We're a team. - [Edison] A team. - A team. - A team. - A team. All right then, team, let's do this. (high whine) - Quickly, move! (dramatic music) (low growl) (high crackle) (engine rumbles) (electricity crackles) - All right, let's settle down, everyone got a place to sit? - Where are we? - This is our command center. - Nope, this is a van. - (laughs) Actually, this is our TTF67, it's one of many vehicles we have situated around the world, to be as inconspicuous as possible so that we can move when we need to move. Ohanzee now has the six pendants and his scepter, so he now has power to control the shadows and he has been watching you, Edward, and following you for the past decade. He has been searching for these pendants for 2500 years and you managed to find all of them in 10. Legend has it that he will come after your first born. - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, we're gonna fix this. He's not gonna hurt you, okay? - That thing's the devil. - He's worse than the devil. Listen to me, Edward, Katie. He will come after Sophie, but after that, he will come for Emma. - No. - What? - What? - He won't quit, Edward. - Me. It's okay. (door bangs) - Emma! - Emma! - How are you here? - Team, this is Officer Jason Loveless. - The babysitter. Thank you so much for taking care of her. - I prefer Officer Loveless. It's my pleasure. We track all potential legends. - So the Loch Ness Monster and the Yeti? They're all real? - Did you not see what we all just saw? - [Jason] Yeah, they're real all right. - As real as Ohanzee. - Indeed, they are all as real as Ohanzee. - Travis is our scientist, resident inventor and generic problem solver. - (laughs) I do a bit of everything around here. We've been watching Ohanzee, studying his shadows, devising a way to capture him. All is not so good in the hood, as some people say. - What about Miss Turner? - His power must have grown over time. Ohanzee is more dangerous now than ever. - And how do we stop him? - Travis. - Well, we're dealing with a new form of fusion energy. Basically, we have a fusion generator that drives a motor, a teeny tiny little motor. That motor uses kinetic energy of radioactive decay particles to produce thrust in a single space no bigger than the size of a dime, that's what give it it's power. You see, for every proton/boron pair that reacts to the laser, at least three alpha particles are created, each one of those alpha particles have a tremendous amount of kinetic energy contained in them. - Like an atom smasher. - Yes, yes (laughs) very similar but not. Now these electromagnetic forces pushes alpha particles and they are directed to a power source and in such a small and dense space it creates a virtual. - A black hole. - A black hole. (laughs) In theory, yes. - You haven't tested it? - Um. (dramatic music) - That's going to save us? - All you have to do is push this button to get Ohanzee into the fusion beam. The beam will then collapse the light on itself hopefully taking him with it. - We've been preparing for this confrontation as long as you've been searching for the pendants. Ohanzee's a formidable foe. He's very powerful and he's using their power for evil. It will take you and your family, Edward. Starting with Sophie. Look here, the shadows. - They're not shadows at all. - They're not. - They're black holes. Well how do we stop it? - I don't like this. - Are we safe here? - I invented the BBFG for this very purpose. - Boron-based fusion. - Fusion generator. You seem to be pretty well educated on this matter. - I was taught a few things about fusion. - Hm, maybe we can even save the world. - Let me get this straight. You guys protect the world from all this evil. - The universe, actually. - And who ae you? Part of the government? - We're a quasi-government group. We went rogue to preserve the vision of our original members. We mustn't waste anymore time, Ohanzee is on his way. - How do you know that? - Because we're inviting him. - When the moon is completely engulfed in the Earth's shadow, you will have to get close enough to him so the BBFG can capture him. - According to the history books I've read, Ohanzee's been roaming the universe looking for the pendant that Dad found and in order for him to use the pendants power he has to hurl the first born of the finder of the pendant into the shadow world. Ohanzee will come for me. I'm the bait, our only weapon. Ohanzee needs light to create shadow warriors. If I can draw him away from all light sources I can beat him back into the darkness. I need to get him to come here, the tunnels. If I can find him and make him follow me back into the tunnels, we have a chance with the BBFG. - Whoa. - That thing will spaghettify her. No way, no way, I will do it. - Dad! - No, I will do it. - Dad, I have to do this. - Sophie. - What we're asking Sophie to do is dangerous. Ohanzee will send his shadows to you. We need you to get close so we can trap them. - Not happening. - No. - Sophie, get over here. - Our hope. - Your hope. Dear god, we don't even know who you people are. Quasi-government rejects, rogue squad. Are you kidding me? And that thing, that, that generator, is there a plan B? - Look, we know it's hard to imagine. Each legend is different and Ohanzee is the worst we've had to deal with this century. But this is real, Sophie could die. She's our only hope. Tomorrow by this time, maybe even the Earth could cease to exist. If this does not work, we're doomed. - She's right, it's real, I have to try. I'm your girl. (thunder cracks) (thunder rumbles) - All right. An ear piece to stay in contact. The button, capture Ohanzee. And the famous torch gun. Good luck. You can do it. Our girl. (rain patters) (car rumbles) (high scream) (low rumble) - I'm sorry for you know, school stuff. - Apology accepted. - I'm sorry, I feel bad. You actually taught me a few things (laughs) - You guys taught me a few things, too. - Good luck. - Good luck. - Come back safe. - I will. - Here. I don't wanna die without ever having a girlfriend. - I don't have a pen. - Oh, uh. - Wait till I get back. - Okay. I believe in you. - I love you, little sis. - I love you too, big sis. - Wait, I'm going too! - Edison, Edison, no you're not. - Dad, I have to, I have to go help. - Let's get this little one to the bunker, where it's gonna be safer and calmer. We have people to look after her, she'll be safe, I promise. - Edison, I don't think it's a very good idea. Listen to your father. - No, no, no, I can do it, I can help. I wanna do something. (laughs) Please. - You heard him, this young man wants to help. He wants to help, he wants to do something. - You'll need an ear piece, stay in contact with us. - I'll see you soon, Dad. - You promise? - I'm so sorry, you shouldn't have to do this. - But I do. - Sophie, we love you. - I love you too. - Go be a hero. - Okay. (sobs) - Take my hat. - I'm coming with you, I'm gonna help. - What? - Me too. - Me too. - [Edward] You need this. (thunder cracks) (screaming) (dramatic rumble) (dramatic music) (high beeping) (thunder crackles) (screen crackles) - Totality lasts. - 14 minutes. - Okay. - They'll have 14 minutes. (dramatic music) - I don't see anything. (screen crackles) - Look. (speaks foreign language) - Mesopotamian. - Sumerian. A 10,000 year old language. - What did he say? - What did he say? - I don't think you wanna know. (high whine) - Sophie, Sophie, we've lost sight of Ohanzee, just stay put. - I'm not going anywhere. (thunder crackles) - I'm sorry, we can't do this. Danni, are you with me? - Yeah! - Johnny, Danni, no! - Oh god, oh god. - What are they doing? For god's sakes. (high whine) (thunder rumbles) (crackle) - The lights! - What's happening, Travis? - It's okay, we planned for this. - Try and help me open it. - It won't work, the door won't open. Run! (high whine) Come on, come on. - They're dead. - But we're not. - We lost em. - We gotta get em into that tunnel. - It's our only hope. - Sophie, Sophie, if you can hear me get back in the tunnel, get back in the tunnel. - He is one creepy looking guy. - We really need to find them. - I think they need to find us. - Johnny, Danni! Where are you? - Guys! - Please don't do this. - We're totally trapped. - We're gonna die, we're gonna die. - Ssh, ssh, shh. - Why, why? - Shut up, ssh, listen. - (laughs) Oh god, what is it? - Don't move. - Why, what is it? - False alarm. (loud thump) (screams) - Open the door, open the door. (screams) - We can't leave them. - Do you really think they'd help us? Really? - They would, they did. For Stuart. - For Stuart. - Open the doors. - I got it. (doors clack) - Guys, we got a big problem. - They have to get in the tunnel. - You're right, there's an override panel in the tunnel. - Maybe we can bypass it. - Yeah. - I'm going. - Edward. - No listen, this is all my fault. My daughter's about to die out there. I'm going. - Yep, I'm going too. - No, Thomas. - We don't have time to chat about this, let's go. - The bypass wires are red and white. Just connect them, it should work. Hopefully. - Yes, go, go! - [Edison] What we do, what we do, what do we do? I don't now what to use. I don't. (screams) Oh, oh (laughs). - Oh, that sound. - They're coming for me. - Have to find something, I mean. - What do you have? (speaks in foreign language) And we thought it was safer with the lights on. (metal rattles) - And we didn't bring a flashlight. (speaks in foreign language) (high whine) - Three, two, one. Come on, work. - I knew I shouldn't put my life in your guys' hands. Why did I do this? - Why, I don't know why. - Oh no. (all scream) Please, come on. - You've gotta be kidding me. - Just, just pick something. - Okay, okay. Let's see. (high scream) - Come on, come on, please. I'll be good, I promise. - Is it working? - Why don't you go and have a look? (high scrape) (high whine) (speaks in foreign language) - Come on, please. - It's not working. - Okay wait. - I'll get straight As, I'll study every day, just please. (speaks in foreign language) (thunder cracks) - No! - Try another! - How about now? (doors clang) - Nothing! (metal clicks) (screams) - Oh god. (doors clack) (kids scream) - Come here, buddy. - Get inside. - [Thomas] Come here, come here buddy. (doors clang) - Well that's a bonus. (high whine) - [Thomas] Come on, buddy. - Edward! (light flashes) (laughs) - Edward, Edward! - Dad! Dad, no! (screams) - Do what you have to do, Sophie, I love you! - Dad it's me he wants. - Go, Sophie, please! - Your life for his. (laughs) (high whine) (screams) (high crackle) - This is our only chance. - Let's go. - No, no, no, son, stay. She can do this. - Dad, she needs my help. I can do this. I love you, Dad. (high whine) (screams) (thunder crackles) - It's me you want. - You don't have to do this alone. - Hurry, you must have something. - [Edison] I don't know, I don't know. - [Sophie] You must have something. - I don't know. - What can we use? (thunder crackles) (lightning crackles) (lightning sparks) (laughs) (screams) Come on. - I don't know, I mean there's a strobe light. - He's too far away, we'll never reach him with that. - Okay, wait. - What? - It's Halloween! - This needs to be the best idea you've ever had. I have to do this. - Do it. - Here. - Okay. - Go back to where you came from. (rumbles) (laughs) (screams) (lightning crackles) (shouts) (high whine) (groans) (groans) (explosion rumbles) (metal clacks) - [Thomas] Edison! - Sophie? - Edward, oh my god, Edward, where are you, where's Sophie? (dramatic thump) - Hey, what the heck? Hey, wake up. - Edison! - Wait. - Edison. - Oh thank god. - Dad? - Come here. - It worked?

We have someone who wants to say something to you. (boots crunch) - Lucy? - Dad, what is it? - Lucy? - Mom, mom! Mom, oh! - Oh, I missed you both so much. (sobs) I love you both so much. So much, I'll never leave you again. - We thought that you were dead. What's going on? - Mom, you're staying right. - Edison, I'm not going anywhere. (sobs) Wait, wait, I have something to say, hold on. All of you are very brave. Very selfless to sacrifice your wellbeing for the benefit of mankind. Edison, your mind is your best asset and your imagination is gonna take you places only you can imagine. - Thanks, Mom. And this is my girlfriend, Sophie. - Sophie. A girlfriend, huh? You are a bright ray of light in the darkness. Built to lead and discover new things. You both have a destiny. Danni, Johnny, your bravery set you apart and we would be honored if you would join us. - For dinner? I'm starving. - If you would join our mission. Our mission to keep the universe safe from evil. To protect those who cannot protect themselves and to sacrifice it all for the greater good. - Lucy? Who are we exactly? - Kids, welcome to The League of Legend Keepers. (dramatic music)
