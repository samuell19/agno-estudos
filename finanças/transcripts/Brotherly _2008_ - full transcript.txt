[ ANSWERING MACHINE ] Hello Gerald, this is Paul calling... just returning your call about the interview... yeah I think I'm ready to talk about it... so I... uhh... I can meet you at the center after work if that is good, OK, thanks, bye. May I smoke? [ RECORDER STARTS ] I was 10 years old. [ TV: ] This concludes our television activities for another day, we invite you to join us again tomorrow. My parents were alcoholics, had been all trough my childhood, sometimes functional... other times... [ Paul: CRYING ] [ BAD DREAM ] ''You are not my son You... you are going straight to hell, you are sick.'' Paul, Paul, Paulie Paulie? Wake up open your eyes. When Michael woke me up, I was relieved, and I just immediately stopped crying, because... it was Michael. All right take off those wet clothes, OK? Underwear too dummy. Did you drink a Coke before bed again? It just happened. I wet the bed... yes, 10 years old and I wet the bed. Arms up. Well... all better? What? Can I just stay with you tonight? I distinctive remember, the anger of my father, [ BANG ] but the thing about alcoholics is if... you never know if what they are doing or saying is authentic, my mom said she loved me but there was never any proof of it, my brother... he was real. Mike? Miky? Yeah. You awake? Yeah. Can I ask you something? What is it? You promise you never... ever to leave me? Shut up. Promise? I promise, and go to sleep, I have a game tomorrow. Miky? What is it? [ SIGH ] It was the first time, that I remembered being that close to another man, male... whatever, that... way. Michael's arms were strong and warm, it was like... I began to understand what it felt like to be safe for the first time in my life, it's my best memory, and uhh... that's... when we started to... mess around... you know... have sex. [ Paul: CRYING ] And this went on for two years, till Michael went off to college, in my head, I thought we were married, like mom and dad, and that he was going take me with him to college to be his... I don't know... wife? but that didn't happen, well I thought... how could you leave me like this? with them... who is going take care of me? [ VAN DRIVES AWAY ] [ SIGH ] He is married now, no we don't talk about it, Jane doesn't even know about it, you are the first person I have told.
