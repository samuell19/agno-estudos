Hide well. Your hair might show. Hide well. Your hair might show. Give your full attention. Otherwise, the ghost might get into your bodies. It needs a body to live in. Here we go. What happened? The ghost is here. Really? Can we see it'? Not everyone can. Even if you do, you probably can't tell. But we can ask. Ask what? Ask what will be on the finals. How will the ghost know that? Because it's the ghost! You're unbelievable! - It hurts! - Where did you come from'? Why didn't you go to the other world? Revenge? Where are you now'? You're such a joke! I was so scared. We should've studied instead. That's right! What are you doing so late? It's my sister Eun-seo. - What's wrong with you? - I can't believe you. Shut up! Eun-Jung, you want to be a witch? You should be studying for the SAT. You call yourself a college student when you got in illegally. Ouch! Go to bed! - You too! - Okay. I'm telling mom when she gets home! - She's so bitchy. - No wonder she has no man. Tell me about it. She has trouble sleeping lately. I wish the ghost took her away. Want to try it again? If we don't send it back... It will eat you alive! Come here! I am the virgin ghost! THE GHOST Don't remember. Take it to your grave. Hey! You had your fun, didn't you? You looked so funny, struggling for life. Knock it off, will you? I can't believe you can't swim. Didn't the army teach you? For 2 years in the army, I did nothing but cook. There's no comparison. You swim more than study. You like water that much'? Anxiety of the present time that dominates our society... stems from the identity crisis that we all suffer. We live in the world that changes so fast... that We fear a great deal for the unpredictable future... which leads us to feel the loss of our existence. It's also related to value issues. We are no longer sure what values count. In other words, we have lost ability to tell which values are... What? What must be valued more than others... such convictions are now very vague. EMPLOYMENT OF GRADUATES Getting a job is a war. It's pretty bad. Look at me when I talk to you. You still have two years left. Why are you so worried'? That's pathetic. The good times are over. I need more than a degree to get a decent job. That's because we have four seasons. We have to change clothes every season. Fed up with four seasons? Is that why you're leaving? Not really. It's the spirit of challenge. For a better life! See you. Where are you going'? To find my umbrella! Does swimming help? Yes, it's so soothing. Like my mother's arms. Is she still the same'? I'm sorry this is the last time I eat cookies with you. Not relieved? I know I stained your career. It breaks my heart to hear that. Your brain waves are normal, but the heart could relapse. Don't forget to take your medicine. Don't be too harsh on yourself. As time goes by, your memory might come back. It's okay. I'll consider it as an umbrella I forgot on the bus. Leave it open... for your late father. You have no idea unless I tell you, don't you? I'm sorry, Mom. You even consider me as your mother? In this big house, I'm always alone... waiting for you all day long. And you're leaving me'? What for'? What do you find lacking that you want to study abroad? I can't believe this. I trusted your father and eked out a living with him. We become well off and then your dad goes away. I've been depending on you but you would careless. Yeah...it's my fault. It's all my fault. Please understand me. The decision didn't come easy. Then why are you leaving? Everything is unfamiliar here. I thought I might as well start all over somewhere else. What about me'? You don't care about me'? ls that it? - Mom. Don't call me mom! When were you like my daughter! I'm begging you not to leave and you don't even care. I can't believe you're my daughter! I got accepted. I've spent so much time trying to find my memory. I just don't want to waste any more time. That is all. I hope you can start living your life, too. Hide well. Your hair might show. Hide well. Your hair might show. Hide well. Your hair might show. What are you doing in there? We're playing hide and seek. Close the door! Okay. I have to change for school. Come on out, will you? I'm telling you. She was in the locker! What? She was a ghost? Come on, there are no ghosts. If not, what was she'? Your health must've declined. Eat this and get well. I'm serious! I know you like fooling me, but you're taking it too far. You know her? You lived in a perfect world. One that your father created. He passed away and you needed someone to take his place. Someone you could hate. So you were there when the accident happened? That's not important. Eun-seo said she had seen something odd. Now she's dead. What? What about you? Seen anything bizarre? I don't know. If not, fine. Why didn't you find me sooner? We go to the same school. I saw you in my dream. You're not wearing makeup. You wouldn't leave the house without it. You're going to get drunk. You think I am'? Not yet. Strange, isn't it'? I don't get along with anybody at school. But you're different. As if I'd known you for a long time. You sure you didn't know me'? I came back to school this year. Remember? Yeah, that's right. Which is better? Living like now... or knowing the past... What do you think is better? - Later. - Bye. Can you help me with the project? It's due tomorrow and you haven't finished it'? No, please help me. But I have a date. - You do'? - Sorry. May be next time. Having mixed feelings about leaving? With a lot of thoughts, too, right'? You've become sensitive. Try not to think about it. What is that? A present. I thought it was cute. It looks good on you. Why are you so nice to me'? You're the only person I can count on. I just want us to remain as good friends like now. Am I proposing here'? I bought it because it was cute. I was going to ask you to treat me to a movie for it. I guess it's off. Okay, let's go tomorrow. How about the first show? We get discounts. Tomorrow it is! Good night. You shouldn't stay out too late. It can be dangerous. Did you drink? I did. Did you eat beforehand? Yes. Don't drink on an empty stomach. What is this'? A friend gave it to me. You must be tired. Go to bed. When did you cook all these? They say you lose sleep with age, and I must be that way. I cooked them for you. Help yourself. Fish soup... It's because you aren't used to it. Fish is good for you. Let's eat. Gosh, I forgot! I tried it on because it was so pretty. It's okay. You can have it. Can I'? Yes. Worried about me, aren't you? I thought it over, and I think I was wrong. I will change now. I mean it. Stop worrying about me and you just take care of your health, okay? Here. That's a bad habit and you aren't even a kid. You didn't like the necklace? Sorry. Sorry. What's wrong'? Are you okay? - I really saw her! - Saw what? The girl by the exit! She sat in front of us. She was dripping water. Didn't you see her eyes? She glared at me. Didn't you see her? - If you did, you did. - I saw her! She reached out to grab me. - You hit me on the shoulder-- - Ji-won! Cut it out, okay? It's hard for me as it is now. So please! We're looking for MIN Ji-won. We're late for class. Are you MIN Ji-won? You know OH Yu-Jung, don't you? What's going on'? Just asking a few questions. Did she tell you she felt her life threatened? Anything like that? What is this? Tell her what it's about first! She was found drowned. KIM Eun-seo died with her lungs filled with water, too They were your friends from SangRim High School, right? Don't remember. Don't remember. Ji-won! Are you all right? It happened in the darkroom last night. No injuries to her body, but she looked as if she was drowned. It was a natural death so don't be too concerned. Although I can't remember they were still my friends. I can't just ignore it. - I can't believe she's here. - Tell me about it. You got some nerve! It's your fault! They died because of you! - Eun-Jung, stop it. - You're to blame! Let go] gun-Jung! Get out of here! YEARBOOK: SANGRIM GIRLS' HIGH SHIN Mi-kyung KIM Eun-seo OI-l Yu-Jung MIN Ji-won KIM Eun-seo Jongno, Pyungchang 252-56 What are you doing here'? Stop pretending that you don't remember! You think you'll be better off abroad? Let's see if that's the case. Wait! What did I do? Please tell me about my past. You stayed out of touch after that trip. And weird things started happening recently. What happened there? You were the leader. You'd always pulled off things. Eun-Jung, right'? Eun-Jung, I really don't remember anything. I really don't. Sorry about yesterday. Mi-kyung is at the hospital. So I thought it was you. Mi-kyung's at the hospital? Everybody seemed crazy. As if they were being chased... So I thought you were the reason. It's not me. I really don't know. Maybe it's my fault. In fact, I hated my sister. I even called out a ghost to trick her. Since then she couldn't sleep at night and she had a hard time. But I didn't care. That night my friends and I were just having fun. There are no ghosts. She died of a natural cause. It's not your fault. - What's the matter? - Never mind. How could I not care'? ls it your friends? I thought you were leaving so you could forget. Do yourself a favor and forget about it. "Forget about it"? What's that supposed to mean? You're hiding something, aren't you? No, I am just saying-- Forget it! You wouldn't believe me anyway. Who could live without water'? But she neither drinks nor touches it. She's so afraid of a water demon. You know she's asthmatic, don't you? It's me, Ji-won. Recognize me'? We're friends from high school. So were Yu-Jung and Eun-seo. Can you recognize me'? You turn me off. You think we liked you? We took advantage of you because you were rich. She comes to me too. Yu-Jung and Eun-seo saw her. Who is it that you see in your dreams? Somethings happening. You know what it is, don't you? Tell me, Mi-kyung. Who do you see at night? Su-in. Su-in? Su-in. Su-in? Who's that? It wasn't me. I didn't do it. You didn't do what? Who's Su-in? Su-in... She's going to kill us. I didn't do it. It was you. You did it! Who's next? Come on, stop it. Why not'? It's fun. Who? Su-in! Are you sure'? Wow, it's going to be fun. Ji-won? DISSOCIATIVE AMNESIA Develop a separate identity, forget real identity... experience severe internal conflicts and see everything as unfamiliar. MIN Ji-won I'm sorry about earlier. I was just worried about you. Tell me. Who are you? What do you mean? I don't know. I don't know who I am. It's like playing hide and seek. But I don't know who "it" is. When I wanted to remember, nothing happened. Now...I'm so scared. Knowing my past... It scares me. It reminds me of old days. You wanted this doll so badly. Then again, we couldn't even afford this. What's wrong'? What happened? Gosh, you're sweating. Are you sick? You don't look good. You don't sleep well, do you? It's not good for you. Don't be sick. If you're sick, I'm sick too. HAN Su-in Hide well. Your hair might show. Hide well. Your hair might show. Take the SAT for Eun-seo. And I'll be your friend. You're not good enough to be my friend. If you show up again, I will kill you! Got it? No way. It's not true. It can't be. How you would relate to such things in the society... that is going to be the topic of our lecture today. Look, Su-in. You gotta do this for me. NO? No? So hard! You're such an artist. But you're smart enough to go to any college. What do you want to study? Sociology. Sociology? My dad would say no if he were alive. It doesn't really interest me. Then why? I can't tell you. What do you want to be later? I...I want to be you. Without you, I could never... When we were little... we didn't have any friends because we were too poor. Now you're rich and have many friends. Like you, I wish I could-- I didn't have friends? I'm not like you. Listen carefully. We're different. I'm not who I was. Don't even go there. Understood? There isn't much to offer you. Since you're Su-in's friend can I talk to you freely? - I will. - Good. Here. You look better in person. As pretty as Su-in said. She bragged about you a lot. You were her only friend. She even liked you more than me. She wouldn't invite you over... because she was ashamed how poor we were. I couldn't blame her. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner. Don't be silly. I thank you for being my girl's friend. She's so bad. Where's she now'? I only wish to know. The phone is switched off... - We need to talk. - Let go. - It won't take long. - I have nothing to say. I know it's hard, but this isn't like you. What's like me'? How much do you think you know about me'? MIN Ji-won, sophomore sociology major... That's what I was told of my identity when I woke up. So I decided to live as her because I wanted to be happy. But... I'm so lost now. You said you didn't know. So, why is this with you? How could you? Why are you doing this to me'? What did I do wrong'? Why won't anybody tell me'? Tell me. Tell me now! It's a good luck charm you gave me when I enlisted. You said you'd be in college by the time I got discharged... studying sociology like me. But you didn't recognize me when I came back. I was relieved, though. Because I never thought of you as more than a friend. You lost your memory, but you looked brighter than ever. I even thought it was a blessing in disguise. I can't pretend anymore. You told me about your friends, but I never met them. Don't take it too seriously. Must be a sheer coincidence. No. Two of them are dead. And Mi-kyung is at the hospital. Somethings happening to me too. I might end up... Was it four of you? Who took pictures then? Calm down and listen to me. This doesn't help. I have to meet Mi-kyung and ask her. It's too late. Ask her tomorrow. No, I have to see her now. She's the only one who knows the truth. Let me out! Let me out of here! Let me out! Let go! Let go! Let go of me! No! Let me go! No, don't leave me alone. She's here to kill me. Let me go. Please! It wasn't me. It was Eun-seo. She told us to keep it a secret. It was Eun-seo! SHIN Mi-kyung, room 404. I need to see her. What's it about? I have to ask her, let me see her! So you really see the ghost? Is it here now'? Crimes break out every 17 seconds. Be grateful to be alive by the end of the day. She was in a nut house for God's sake. The case has been closed. Let it go, okay? I don't expect you to believe. But I don't care. It's my own business. What should we do'? We should find her. Su-in... I'm sure she's there...waiting for me. How did we meet? When you were a junior in high school... You were crying in the rain because your father had died. I couldn't just walk by so I bought you some warm soup. Since then, you waited for me every night in the alley. Somehow you got my number and kept calling. I did? You asked me to buy you a necklace once you got into college. So that necklace...'? Yeah, that's right. Is that why you didn't tell me'? Because it's not a good memory for you. - Come on. - Okay. No way we're taking her. How did she find out? She threatened to rat on me if we don't take her. It would be so awkward. Let's take her. We can use her to carry bags and take pictures. Don't tell your mom, okay? Come on! Yahoo! Yahoo! One, two, three! Hey! - Do it again. - The angle isn't right. You can swim, can't you? Happy Birthday! Eun-seo, help me! Ji-won! It was my fault. Because of me... I'm sorry, Su-in. I'm so sorry. We need you to tell us what you said before. It's been almost a year. Why didn't the body decay'? It's the arsenic in the water. It prevents decay. And fish can't live in it. Detective. Ji-won will be okay, right'? Eun-seo didn't want it known how she got into college. And Ji-won is amnesic. A further investigation is needed, but she should be okay. Now you can leave without the burden. You want me to? No. But that's what you want. Take care. Ji-won. Where did you go'? I've been waiting for you. I'm sorry. You're so concerned about me and I've been too selfish. I'm not leaving. I won't. I'll stay with you and make up for what I put you through. It's all over now. We will live happily. What do you mean it's over'? It's only the beginning. Mom... "Mom"? You... You still think you're me'? You realize who I am'? Then you must know who you are. The fishy smell from you, it's so disgusting! I became your friend out of pity and you had to play ME! You like living as me'? You think I'd let you live happy? No. No... I tormented you every night... so I could get my body back. I know who I am. I'm MIN Ji-won. No, you are not ME! You're HAN Su-in! No! I'm not Su-in. I am... What do you want to be later? I want to be you. You should kick that habit. Not wearing makeup? - Who do you see in your dreams? - I saw you in my dream. Don't remember. Take it to your grave. - What's this? - A friend gave it to me. You asked me to buy you a necklace once you got into college. Can I have it? Stop worrying about me and take care of yourself. Don't be sick. If you're sick, I'm sick too. You've never lived upon your will. You think you could me in my body? You're so pathetic. And I had to suffer for you! All the pain I've felt... You should feel it too. Now...I want my body back. You're right. I've never lived upon my will. Even me being you... Not anymore. You... You were my only friend. I'm sorry, Ji-won. Hey there. Thank God I came back. Mom? After your father died, she drank constantly... You two didn't quite get along. But who could imagine... I'll change now. From now on, I'll never leave you alone.
