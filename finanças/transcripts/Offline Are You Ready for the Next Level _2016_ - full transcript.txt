Can you feel the wind rising from the north, the shadows deepening, and the spirits of the fallen, calling to you? The sun will set three more times before Ragnarök dawns, the greatest online tournament of all time. So, sharpen your swords, and prepare for... the challenge of your life. Sorry, Fenris, I was out of range. You better get your shit together by Ragnarök. Sure... I won't be taking a dump during the tournament, either. What? No bathroom for anybody for the next three days. Oh, that's gonna suck, dude. But if it's gonna score the trophy... But if you go deep into the cave... ...and touch the rock, there will be no limit to what you can achieve. -Tristan says... -Get out of here with your Tristan. He hasn't been online forever. But is there another gamer who won Ragnarök three times in a row? Tristan Shmistan. He's right, as usual. Look, the Cave of Destiny. CAVE OF DESTINY Upgrade's gonna-- This area is neutral. Loki? What's he doing here? -Mom, fuck. -Fenris, you can't just-- Are you sleeping Are you sleeping Brother Jan, brother Jan? Morning bells are ringing Early birds are singing Oh, Mom. Rise and shine, sleepy head. It's quarter to already. Mom. There's nothing here I haven't seen before, right? Snuggle attack. Oh, Jan, dear. We're proud of how you've handled the last few weeks. You know I don't want to have to send you to St. Anna's. But you've been sticking to our deal. And you strike me as more sensible, and mature, which makes me very happy. Bran? No, thanks. But you're right, graduating is the most important thing right now. But, Mom... Yes, my dear? Jan... he is... He really is a swell big brother. That's right. And isn't it nice we have so much time for each other as a family now? Banzai calling for Fenris. Banzai. Banzai. I was dreaming of you, bro. How romantic. No, not like that, man. You wanna know what I was dreaming? I dreamed Fenris chopped the whole arena into tiny bits of rubble, and chopped those bits into even tinier bits. And you know what he did then? He took those tiny bits, and chopped them into micro pieces, dude. I told you you're good enough to go pro. You keep up that way, and we'll be raking in the dough soon. Speaking of which, when do we sign up for the tournament, anyway? Hey, Jan. Hi. Hey, you wanna come over to my place later? You know all about computers, right? SURE THING, HONEY. NEVER, YOU WITCH. GOT SOMETHING BETTER TO DO. BEHIND YOU, A THREE-HEADED MONKEY. Yeah, sorry... but I'm really busy... with practice. You know? Told you there's no point asking nerd boy. It was worth a shot, Honey Bunny. Good work, bro. Chicks gotta wait till the triumphant victor returns from battle. -What's that? -It's a pee bag, man. So we don't have to go to the bathroom at Ragnarök. Hey, that's great. Thanks for your support. We're the ultimate team. Nobody stands a chance against me and Gotrax. Gotrax? Yeah, who are you signing up with, anyway? I'm still keeping... my options open. That's great. Hey, I gotta run. Thanks, huh? See you. Yo, Fenris, where have you been? Sorry, real-life stuff. Status? Loki and Tin Can are still standing guard. They're ganking every noob who even comes close to the Rune Stone. What? We need that upgrade to stand a chance in the tournament. Together we'll destroy them. FROST AMULET I tank and you deal damage. Three... two... one... Ragnarök. Awesome level design. It's an honor to share this moment with you. That's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Now no one can-- Gotrax? LOGIN FAILED Please, say, "Smithy" if you have a technical problem. Smithy. -Smithy. -Welcome to the Smithy, adventurer. -Have you tried restarting your computer? -What? Of course I rebooted. Hello? You're out, Fenris. YOU'RE OUT, FENRIS! Oh, fuck. Okay, people, this is the real deal. The boss is right ahead of us. Everyone follow my orders now. No grandstanding, and most of all, no sudden movements by the eggs, or else the pixels will blow up around our ears. Deniz. I don't know what to do. I'm right in the middle of a dungeon run. I can't get back in. Internet, smartphone... it's all down. I've been hacked. That sucks, but I'm afraid I can't help. FROST AMULET Not like I'm a Game Master or anything. Iced tea? Where... Where'd you get the Frost Amulet from? You must've got it from me. Did you send me that fucked-up text? -Hey. Tell me what it is. -Hey, Jan. Let go. We're toast. Oh, man, Jan. We're toast. Retreat! What is it, man? Jan, stop. Come on, spit it out. He wrote me a chat message. We just wrote briefly, I swear. And? He wished me luck. And he wanted to know... if you had a pet. Who? Who wanted to know about Frodo? Loki. You told Loki the answer to my default security question? I'm sorry, bro. You're sorry? Oh, man, how can anyone be so stupid?! You know what, man? I'm not sorry, and now piss off. You're scoring high on the aggro. His name's Loki, L-O-K-I. Yeah, he's pretty tall, and wears a black robe with arcane symbols. His special abilities are fire spells and necromancy. He's the God of the Underworld. Can you handle this? Some kind of problem with... -a computer game. -Not a problem, a crime. Have you tried restarting your computer? Is there an expert for cybercrime or something? I am the expert on cybercrime. And you're welcome to bring your computer in, but it better not contain any illegal downloads. Programs, games, music. Horror films... pornos. MISSION FREE FENRIS! DON'T WORRY. MEETING STUDY GROUP. JAN MUNICH Hello. I'm... I'm here because... have a huge problem. I lost everything. I even know who it was. Another player. Fill out the form. We'll look into it in the next two weeks. But it took me years to get where I am. And Ragnarök is in 63 hours. Then you'll have to fill it out quickly. ATTACK!!! HAVE MERCY, PLEASE! TAKE MY GOLD! BEHIND YOU, A THREE-HEADED MONKEY! Anything else? Oh, man. Goddamn paper-pushing bullshit. Fenris. Where? I'm Karo. Yeah? And? Gotrax. You're Gotrax? The invincible, all-destroying, bloodthirsty Gotrax, The Butcher of Grimsberg, is a... girl? That's right, the one and only Gotrax... who kept Loki from eating you for breakfast today. Without me... -Did it happen to you, too? -Like a digital nuclear bomb. And Mr. Mikado won't tell me who did it. It was Loki. -You sure? -Yeah. I found out he got my password from Luna... I mean, Deniz. If we find out his real name we'll know where he lives. I know where Deniz lives. Not Deniz, Loki. We just have to get at his computer. I'll tank, and you deal damage. -We? -Sure, we're a team, aren't we? Yeah... in the game. Victim. What? BOMB!! I'm Fenris, I'm a Level 69 Warrior. Careful with the backpack! Hey, Karo. Excuse me. Hey, what's wrong with you? You didn't wanna join me. You still didn't have to make me a terrorist. Hey, where are you going, anyway? I didn't find out his real name, but his IP is somewhere in Alp Valley. In Alp Valley? What do you care, anyway? I... I thought I may tag long... after all. -We're a team, aren't we? -Yeah... in the game. If I can get Fenris back... and we win Ragnarök, I'll let you have all the gold. For real? Swear it. Okay... I swear. No, for real. I... That is you, Fenris from the Far North, swear to bravely defy all danger, and if we win... to leave all the gold to me, Gotrax, that is! What kind of oath is that? Say it. -I, Fenris-- -Louder. From the Far North, swear to bravely defy all danger, and if we win, leave all the gold to Gotrax. Welcome to the team. Isn't that our train? Yes. Dear Premium Customer, I'm afraid I have to inform you there has been unauthorized access to your customer data. There were two players here who-- That's right... Fenris and Anthrax-- Gotrax. Should we have Technical Support check it out--? No? Hey, you, don't get caught without a ticket. So? It's not like everyone has to know. I ride without a ticket. Sometimes I don't wash my hands after taking a piss, and when I was 11, I had the runs for a month. You're crazy, you know that? No big deal. Went right away with the right salve. Hey. "Tristan's Ragnarök Hat Trick." "Twenty Gaming Tips by Tristan." -Here, leave it. -You really got nothing to snack on? No. Why don't you have anything? It would've got really ugly if they found out. If my parents find out, they'll send me to boarding school. Boarding school? Where do you think I'm coming from? I've run away like a million times. You sound like a felon. Well, year before last, I borrowed my supervisor's car. Your supervisor let you drive... his car? Anyway, now I need money to pay for the store window. What? How was I supposed to know Shostakovitz burned so well? That's why you're so into winning the prize? Yes. But you know selling virtual gold is illegal, right? You have serious anger issues. Tickets, please. Going to the city? Damn. She's seen us. Let's get out of here. Hey, man. Shut up, you idiot. -Come on. -Too late, now be quiet. Okay, now take your paws off each other, and then I'd like to see your tickets, please. -Run! -Now what? Stop. No one gets away from our train. CARD Could you look the other way? You can pull the emergency brake in case of danger. We were in danger. -The conductor would've called the cops-- -Damn. Like I say. DEBIT CARD DENIED Loki. It's not so hard to have them blocked. Date of birth, card number, and owner. Speaking of anger issues... It's all a huge disaster. You're a disaster. Then we'll hitchhike. Can you trace an IP address? Since I turned 11. Mistywood. Do you think they've noticed we're gone? Hey, wait a second, Heisenberg. We need a plan. A plan? Three persons in Quest Area. Two NPCs. An enemy with limited range. I'll go in first. Hello, I need to go... online. Use the IP to find the right map to lead us to Loki. Team attack. -Now it's your turn. -Hi there. Ask about vegan products on supply. Where would I find vegan products on supply? That noob will be totally confused. Just look at it. It lists all the contents. Distraction. Examine products critically. Drop it all in the perfectly placed backpack. Retreat. While you distract the owner... What's the big idea? I'll finish up at the computer and disappear with the loot. WANTED! 10,000 GOLD REWARD Do you have any idea how much gets stolen here every year? Lots of customers? Oh, yes? You just watch out, little Missy. Dad? Dad, they robbed us. The hunt is on. The perfect combo. Sausage cookies. Try one. What do we do when we find Loki? We'll figure something out... somehow. If I buy 100 healing potions in Utgard, I can heal myself a hundred times. And here, I can't even open a can. Hey, what are you gonna do if you don't get Fenris back? Kill yourself? It all went so fast, you could hardly react. What's the world coming to? They were hardly more than kids, officer. The boy... was kind of tall, a bit of a wallflower. The girl had blue hair. That's what I said, blue hair. What's that supposed to mean? Never heard of it. I'm gonna close up shop if things go on like this. No one's ever gonna stop? What's that? Anne gave this to me before she took off. -Anne? -My mom. I find it soothing somehow. Really? And this one helps making wishes. Wishes? Yeah, if you send out a truly pure thought, you get what you want. From whom? The universe. Well, what did you wish for? Why not wish for a million Euros, pay off your debts and get your life back? You only get stuff you really need. Life isn't a bonus level, but it doesn't let you down, either. Pure coincidence. That's what you think. -Nice of you to give us a ride. -Yeah. So, where to? MISSION: ESCAPE AMBUSH! Use Smartphone... ...with bearded coachman. BEARDED COACHMAN Combine cord... CORD ...with car window. WINDOW Use coke bottle... COKE BOTTLE ...with mint candies, Karo. MINT CANDIES Spit them in here. Let's get out of here! He isn't answering on his phone... or replying to texts. His sister tried to get ahold of him, too. She always gets ahold of him. He's probably just at a friend's house. Or a girlfriend's. Not my Jan. Besides, we called everyone. Isn't this that kid whose computer game was stolen? Raclette. Rumpelstiltskin. It's called Ragnarök. The tournament is called Ragnarök. The game is called Utgard. And something's wrong with it. You have no idea where we are. Yeah. Distances looks shorter on the map somehow. What? I said-- Oh, shit. Is the mighty warrior pooping out already? Mommy... Pee-pee... Cold. The warrior is just warming up... lame troll girl. But I do twice the damage. But my sword is twice as fast. -You gotta duck Loki's fireballs. -Duck. This is neutral Quest Area. Whoever's across last is goblin slime. Karo. Fenris is still looking for me. I already helped you. -What am I supposed to do? -Think of something. Threaten his family, burn his house down, do something. Just make him go home. Are you serious? Everything I gave you, I can take away with a single click. He's still my friend. As you wish. -You okay? -Yeah-- Look, we'll make until there, okay? Come on. The Cave of Destiny is kind of picturesque. Saved from your munchies. Got a can opener, by any chance? Still edible. Then I'll have to scare up some real food. And what's the... goofy teddy bear who forgot his can opener gonna hunt? My favorite prey are defenseless wood witches. Get that thing away from me. Come on. Come here. What's a one-legged girl gonna--? What? Okay, let's call it a tie. Can't we...? Karo? I'm loud and difficult. No one can stand me. What a mess. Yeah. What a mess. You're only here with me because you have to be. But I... I promised we'd do it together. And Fenris from the Far North keeps his word. Check it out. It all looks totally 3-D. Where'd you learn that? Survival blog. Well? Thou art a master craftsman... Fenris from the Far North. I can walk again. I can walk again. I'll give Fenris back to you... I'LL GIVE FENRIS BACK TO YOU... ...if you join my team and drop the girl. ...IF YOU JOIN MY TEAM AND DROP THE GIRL!! Karo. Karo. I have to tell you something. -What? -It turned itself off all by itself-- -Look. -What? It's just a big animal. -It's just a big animal. -Yup. Come on. Don't come too close. We're dangerous. No, we're not. We're not? What are you doing here? We're being followed. By whom? For Yggdrasil! Time out. That's a real ax. That's not allowed. Isn't this the real-life quest? -What? -The hunt for Fenris and Gotrax? Loki offered a reward of 10,000 gold pieces. Virtual gold, of course, not real. -But the quest is real, of course. -And not virtual. Whatever you say. But those two, I think don't want to play with you. War council. I think Loki fooled us. Not now. WHO IS LOKI? I said, not now. So, you're Luna? What's going on? Deniz, this may be a little much for you right now, but it's very important you tell us the truth right now. If you know anything about where Jan is-- I want a lawyer. Lawyer shmawyer. You tell us everything you know right now. Tamame? Anastikme? What does this place look like anyway? Cops in the house, a total mess here, that pizza. Don't worry, we won't tell Loki anything. -Kick the wimp's ass. -Fingers crossed. -For Yggdrasil! -For Yggdrasil! Hey, thanks. That was way cool of you. -Don't worry. -Oh, we could've-- There's food in there. And a shower. It's like a fairy tale. More like the Middle Ages. You have Internet? Sure, I have Internet. I have electricity and running water, too. Here. Help yourselves. And you live here by yourself? Yeah. I was just sick of consumer society. Cool. Consumer society. I wanted to be my own boss. Independent. Do whatever I want, whenever, with whomever I want. Yeah. So do I. Bacon? And you made everything here yourself? Well, not everything. That's impossible. But I made this here. This table, which I'm touching in such a sexy fashion. I wanna be touched in a sexy fashion, too. Me, too. I made something myself once, too. -What? -What? Hey, thanks. But listen. I think me and my girlfriend have to go now. We have to be in Tannenfels tomorrow morning. Right, honey? It's not so far to Tannenfels. If you want, you can crash here, and then I'll drive you over tomorrow. -No way. -Way cool, thanks. It'll be worth your while. I wanted to inaugurate my pool tonight. What's your problem? This is a total random encounter, just like in any role-playing game. A distraction from our real quest, a complete waste of time. I'm not walking another step tonight. Hey, Ragnarök is in... 12 and a half hours. We're having a pool party -with a forest gnome? -You could be a little grateful to Ben. Do you even still want Gotrax back? -What kind of stupid question is that? -Tristan says-- Is that all you can think about? Don't you have enough of your own crap to analyze? I don't jump in the lap of-- Fuck. Apple juice? Equipped with the skills... NEW THE LUMBERJACK ...stone six-pack... EXTRA MUSCLE ...deadly ax blow... ...and double potency. The new superclass lumberjack will strike terror... WOMEN WILL LOVE HIM ...in the hearts of all other classes. Where are your towels? Under the guitar. You've got a great girl. It'll all work out. I've been there. She's not really my girlfriend. Yeah. But you like her, don't you? -Man, I see how you look at her. -Is it any of your business? POLICE MANHUNT This is your last chance. THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE What are you looking at? Not another step. Come. Come. Cowpat party with Thorsten and Macy. Cowpat party and the village gets crazy. That's right. Look them right in the eyes or else. Wanna dip? Come on in. The water's great. Come on. I'm a whale. -In your face. In your face. -No, not in my face. Karo? What? Just relax now, okay? Come on. Come on in. You're wet already. I'm in. I'M IN! Then come here. Alone. THEN COME HERE... ALONE!!! Hi. Loki? -Jan. -Jan? Jan? Jan? Jan? Jan? Every workstation has 16 core processors, or 32, thanks to Hyper-Threading. And the CPU bases have Xeon Processors. Tristan? -You are... -Loki. And it's an honor to finally meet you in person. The warrior behind the warrior, so to speak. This is Quang, one of the top Taiwanese players. I think he's from Korea. Who would've played with me, but now you're here. So? How do you like your new kingdom? Truly amazing what they'll do for a few euros. You should consider getting your own Chinese farmer. Stop. This is getting way too weird. Yes, I know. I sure gave it my best shot, huh? Who could appreciate it more than you? We're so alike, Fenris. And we will write... Ragnarök history together... side by side today. But you don't have a lot of time to get used to your new equipment now. Partner. Well, hell. You cowardly, egocentric shit. I thought we were a team. Your knight in shining armor took off without you? I thought we were a team. Neat, huh? Tristan put all his dough into this. All of it. But why? He's already the best, a legend. That's history. Proud elves are out. Tristan needs a comeback, a new image. Everything's about the clicks today. You got clicks, you got cash. No clicks, you go downhill fast. And we foiled his plan. Yeah, you and Gotrax as a team would've squashed him. That would've been the end of it for him, the knockout. So, he had to do something. Ultimately, no one remembers the losers. Karoline Adamek, right. But I sent you the coordinates a long time ago. Hurry up, please, okay? I don't know how long she'll be there. I´m going to look for him. Come on, Karo. Man... you're not serious, are you? You're not going after that little nutcase because of... some silly game tournament? It's not even real, man. This here is all real, you know. I'm real. And this would... be real, too. -Real enough? -Yeah. I felt that for real. Hey. Karo. Hey, hey. You won't get far like that. You said yourself it's not far. Yeah, but you won't even get not far that way I have to find Jan. And I don't care... whether that's real or unreal to you. Hail ye, brave warriors. Let it be Ragnarök. The rules are simple: Assemble in pairs, if you dare, if you are brave enough. But be warned: You lose everything to whoever vanquishes you, and you're dead and gone for good if you die in this ruthless tournament. Hello, dear friends, welcome to the greatest online tournament ever. RAGNAROK THE ONLINE TOURNAMENT DANIELE RIZZO SARAZAR Let it be Ragnarök. And the prize is the biggest in the gaming world: a big pile of cash. A million pieces of gold. -That's a pretty penny. -Right, but if you die here today, your avatar will be deleted, and you have to start all over as a level-one character. I'm really excited to find out which teams assembled this year. What? Okay, that's a surprise. Fenris is competing with Loki? CALLING FENRIS Idiot. Ready for digital immortality? Of course, sure thing. -Ten. -Here we go. Nine. Eight. Seven. Good luck, master. -Six. -You, too. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Fight. Oh, dude. Heavy blow from left. -Nineteen-point-four seconds. -Yeah. What? That's a new record. Perfect. 19.6 SECONDS NEW SPEED RECORD Whew, the first round is over, separating the wheat from the chaff. Let's see how it goes on. All the low-level characters are down, and now the chips are down, too. A left-right combination, and then a strike. Brilliant. What a finisher. Thirty kills. Loki and Fenris are unstoppable. What's going on with Fenris? -Disconnected? -No idea. I thought we were a team. Why isn't he reacting? Oh, God, the troll. Trolls. Too slow. And they never learn, but they burn swell. Master, there's a five-minute timeout. Then the finals start. Make sure all your cool-downs are ready. If you send out a truly pure thought, you get what you want... from the universe. This is the MSI-GD65 gaming motherboard. So, for our first step, let's install the CPU. Jan, are you crazy? Have you gone completely nuts? Shit, Deniz. What? I'm really up shit creek What's wrong? You have to take part in Ragnarök. What? You have to take part in Ragnarök right now. Are you crazy? And why are we talking so quietly? Please, Deniz, no questions now. I just need your help. Got it, bro. I'm down with that. Are you focused? Sure. Come on, let's show them who's boss. And win the finals. Final open round. Next up is the legendary final open round, my friends. Open to individual players, too. Three. Two. One. Deniz? Wow, Low-Level Luna drew the wild card. LUNDA 99% What the hell? What are you doing here? Are you some kind of megalomaniac? You're only level 22, and you're alone. I'm not scared of you. Come here if you dare. I can take on four of you with one arm tied behind my back. Okay, fine. And the battle is on. Luna's got a big mouth, in any case. Let me handle it. I've got a score to settle with him. Amazing. Fenris is going to handle it. Deniz, now. No, no, no. If this is what you want, then... confirm with K. -It can't be. -Why is he hanging around on the ground? Are you serious? You really want to give up all of this? Jan... it's about the girl, isn't it? Forget the girl. I already called the cops. They're probably picking her up right now. I'm sorry. Listen, man, Battle for Utgard is not real. I know that as well as anyone. But everything we're doing here is real. Think about it. It's all intertwined: the stock market, the economy, politics, the media, your supermarket. Here, my fridge. Everything that happens: the whole world consists of data, numbers, information. There will never be a world without Internet again, so, a golden era's dawning for people like us. Your... virtual identity... will become more important than anything else. That is the point. Just think what we can create together. It's absolute power. What the hell, dude? -You don't understand a thing. -Fenris' property goes to Luna. Deniz, you have to stop him, until Gotrax gets here. And call Yggdrasil's Guardians. You're my last hope, champ. I won't let you down. We're not so similar after all. I'm the best. I'm a killing machine. Fuck. I'm... I'm fucked. You can't stop the cops from catching her. And her troll is no use behind bars. Your sacrifice is too late. You can't save her. What are you even doing? Loading quad riding skills. Systems online. You insect. Come on. Impressive. Hi. It has to be here somewhere. Look out, there's someone lying there. My God. Is she hurt? For Yggdrasil. For Yggdrasil. And for Jan. Mighty spell of terrible confusion. Karo, I really screwed up. I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? Everything. We don't have any more time. Right. The tournament is on. Deniz needs your help now. Luna can't stand up to Loki for long. Who knows how long Yggdrasil's Guardians can help us? Have you gone totally crazy now? You can get Gotrax back. Karo... I just felt really miserable next to him. I just wanted to go back to where... Where I am somebody. Scram. Before we arrest all of you for obstructing an officer. Yes, yes, yes. -You got that? -What? -Sure, why? -I have to go. -Now? -Yeah. Don't worry, you can do it. I don't want to have died in vain, after all. What? And one more thing. You're a real disaster. But the best disaster that ever happened to me. Go on. Go ahead. Come on, you can do it. We can do it! Sorry for leaving you like that, but I need to use your laptop right away. Thanks. Gamers. Guys, Luna is gonna bite the dust in a matter of seconds. You can really feel sorry for her. Are you on the ground? Are you crying? Got you. This isn't a battle, it's an execution. Oh, my God. It's getting serious. Gotrax. Yeah. Finally. Goddamn it. Who would've thought Gotrax would show up at the last second and help Luna? Rats. No. Amazing, but Loki is channeling a giant megaspell. He's desperately gathering all the energy he still has. And still, Gotrax and Luna manage to escape at the last moment! Loki is totally confused. That's a mighty hit from Luna. You shouldn't have messed with a team... single player. For Yggdrasil! And for Karo! And for Ben! And for Jan! I'm not sure if I understood this, but you claim to be Karoline Adamek. Virtually? That's right. I hacked her system and stole her identity. So, you really committed all the crimes she's accused of? Yeah. And I have no idea where this Karo person is. Pretty wild. What you can do technically nowadays. Lechner, hello? Yes? You found him? And he's okay? You got Jan back. That was it, all right. Ragnarök is over. Incredible. Oh, my God. Gotrax and Luna, the Wild Card kids, popped up and turned it around. That was it from Ragnarök for this year. See you again next year. Tristan... you'll always be the greatest to me. For Yggdrasil! For Yggdrasil! THREE MONTHS LATER Got you, Mr. Lechner. Detention. -You should see your face, teacher's pet. -What are you doing here? I heard you're in urgent need of a LAN party... for two. What do you look like? So, did you pay Shostakovitz? Selling virtual gold is illegal. Right. So, I bought an armored flying lizard instead. You're a total disaster. Just for that, I can do quadruple damage. Quintuple damage! SNUGGLE ATTACK
