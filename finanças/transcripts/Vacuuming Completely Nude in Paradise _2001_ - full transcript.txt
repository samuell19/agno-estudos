(CROWD CHEERING) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) It's Throat's last day. -Retiring? -Dying. He's only got two weeks to live. Can't sell any more. Voice gone. Upset because he wanted to die on the knocker. There goes a salesman! -Are you a manager, then? -I do the music. -She's me girlfriend. -Don't you mind? I want her to stop, but I can't find work. -What do you do? -Mix music. Lot of call for that kind of work, then? No, it's an interest. (EXCLAIMING) You'll have to support her, son. What about selling? Look at me. I made it and I've got a glass eye. Come on. Show it to me! (CROWD JEERING) All right. All right. Bloody hell! I'll take me bra off. (CHEERING AND WHISTLING) Fuck off with that! Get off me! Don't touch me. Let go of me hair, you bastards! MAN: Thank you! Quiet, please! Thank you, my dear. And thank you to the generous soul who booked this striptease telegram for Throat. (CHEERING) We will all miss you, sir. -Well, now... -Get any coin we're owed and get out of here. I'm black and bloody blue from these bastards! MR RON: Needs have been shared. The week is nearly through. All that's left now is for me to say a few words. (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) You have a floodlight inside. It is as big as your body. And when you think you're through, and you've done enough, there is the trigger to turn it on. And bam! Take them by surprise, dazzle their eyes, they will stand in your beam and they will buy. (CROWD EXCLAIMING) You have a purpose. You have a mission. Your next sale is lying there behind every "no, thank you" you receive. Like a diamond, it is there, waiting, glinting. See it! Reach for it! Have it! Go for it! You can do it! You can do it because you are salesmen! (CHEERING) As you know, the companies have thrust us up to our elbows in a treasure chest, an outstanding product, unrivalled commission packages and now... And now they are pouring prizes upon our heads. I'm talking top salesman, the two-week booty in Benidorm. (CHEERING) The Golden... The Golden Vac! Speed on, come through, roll out those vacs. -What are we in? -ALL: The greatest game on earth! You got it! You got it! High-five me! (ALL CHEERING) We are in! We are in! We are in! We are in! (CHEERING SUBSIDES) He's dead. (HONKING CONTINUOUSLY) I'm sick of this job. Sick of it! Well, you don't have to do it no more. What are you gobbing on about now? -You don't have to do this kind of work no more. -Oh, no. No, no, no, not this again. You're off in your own little world, aren't you? Hi-fi head. Where's the coin coming from, eh? -I said I'd stop when you got a job. -I got one. Oh, I don't mean mixing cassettes for the teenagers down the lane. It's not, no. I've got meself a job. (MUSIC PLAYING) See what it can do. We're hardly attached. It's got a mind of its own, this little rascal. Watch it go, light. Light... Light as a long balloon. -PETE: He can't hold it, Tommy. -What! -He can't. It's his hand, it's withered. -No, but she can, can't she? Go on. Sit down. Sit down. Go on. Go on. You've worked hard. You deserve it. Sit down. Have a bit of cake, finish your tea. There now. Easy. But light, hmm? Light, you'll agree? And yet, it's got a power of a suck on it, too! Turn it up full, you'll have Australian shoes in your living room before you know where you are! Not only that, it'll do your furniture, your curtains, your ceilings, your corners, under the cooker, over the door. Crevices cringe and cry when they see this coming. I couldn't say that again. Wouldn't try, not with my teeth. (CHUCKLING) No, it'll do you the absolute lot, this. Mr and Mrs Tucker. If I may, Lorna and Edward... If I may, Lo and Ted. Have it. Possess it. Go on. You know you want it. -We likes it. -We can't afford it. Can't afford it? Can't afford it? Don't give me that! You can if I lob 100 off. No, no, no, no, no! Don't agree yet. Do not agree yet. Because I really, really want you to have this machine, I'm gonna swallow, I'm gonna lose. I'm gonna take it and gonna lobe another 50 off, so you can get out and get yourselves a slap-up meal on me. -Ta. -Sign here. I'm not going till you do. There! 'Tis yours. Beauty, isn't it? Huh? Leave it there in the middle of the room. Look at it awhile before you use it. Ta-ra. I must dash. -Ta-ra. -Ta-ra. (DOOR SHUTS) Listen, you, never, never interfere when I'm selling, right? -He couldn't hold it. -He had another hand, didn't he? -No. -Well, he can shove it up his fucking arse! I don't care. We're moving vacs here, pal. -Not doing physiotherapy on him, okay? -Okay. "He can't hold it!", told me. When I'm on me first round, if I'd come in with piss like that, the old salesman I was with would have choked me outside and kicked me hard in the face and he'd be bang on right for doing it and all. Lesson number one, laddie boy. If they waver, see to the dithering bastards don't give 'em no quarter. Here, let's have something for the road, in there. -Do you live in here? -Usually, yeah. Here, pass me that there. Oh, right. -Got to, if you wanna be number one. -You sleep in here all time? No. Sometimes a motel or Ruby's. -Who's Ruby? -You are new, aren't you? Ruby, the showroom slag. Here, pass me that Puffa Puffa Rice. Quickly! Rule number two. Always start the day... (MUNCHING) With a good breakfast. (ENGINE REVVING) (TYRES SCREECHING) -(SPITS) -No, thanks. -What, you don't like one of a morning? -I don't smoke. -What are you, a fucking health freak, or what? -No. -What, you don't smoke? -No. You'll have to give that up. (HORN BLARING) (CHUCKLING) What's your favourite football team? Who's your favourite Page 3? What do you like, then? Dance music. I don't play, I just like... Like mixing a bit. -Tell me something, er... What's your name? -Pete. Pete. Tell me something, Pete, how'd you come for this job, you? I was at your office meeting with me girlfriend. Weren't you there? Tommy don't go to them, too busy selling to listen to losers get pissed and talk about selling. -Anyway, they all fucking hate me, there. -I met Sidney there... -Oh, say no more. Press-gang Sid. -It was the night Throat died. -Throat died? I didn't know. Did he leave any leads? -I... Oh, too late. Those jackals will be going through his stuff, even as we speak. He was almost gone when they took him on, desperate bastard, no other company would've touched him in that state. He was selling by mime in the fucking end! Listen, er... Pete, I don't want to disillusion you, mate, -they'll take on any twat and I mean any twat. -Oh. Train 'em for two days, if they don't perform, twat 'em off by Twatday. Oh, not me. I'm gonna make a real go at this. -Oh, aye. -It's the greatest game going. -(EXCLAIMING) -(BLOWING HORN REPEATEDLY) Fucking hell! (TYRES SCREECHING) -You stinking piece of tiny stinking... -Fucking asshole! Yeah, and the same to you, you fucking bum bandit! There's nothing like a bit of road rage to get you going of a morn. (COUGHING) Better than caffeine! -So you've got a bride, then? -Eh? -Girlfriend you said. -Oh, yeah, Sheila. -What does she do, then? -Eh? -The bride! -Nothing. -Nowt? -Yeah. -Oh, sponger. -No, no. She was the one who was working. -What did she do? -Stripogram. -Eh? -Stripogram. Thought that's what you said. Fuck me! A stripper! -Stripogram. -Got a picture? -No. -Stripper, eh? French maid? Traffic warden? St Trinian's? Fucking nice! -Quick pit stop. -Eh? -Me flat. -Your... I thought you... I don't fucking sleep there. It stinks. Come in. Make yourself at home. Here, have a toss. (MOBILE RINGS) Oh, who the fuck is that? Hello! Oh, you owe me money! It was my lead, you prick. I fucking found it for you, know it was. Don't fucking argue back. Yeah, I'm up for salesman of the year. Yeah, yeah. Friday night. Golden Vac. They've saddled me with this twat of a trainee. Yeah, holding me back a bit. No, he's not listening? Are you? Are you listening? Oh, too busy looking at my knob, I think. Come on! Bring a vac or two. Rule number three. Wherever you be, always have a vac or two ready and cocked in case of a quick sale. -Can I put the radio on? -No! I'll put this tape on that I mixed. No. You can have a motivation tape on, though. One I made. Got woofers on this car, you know. * Sell! Sell! Fucking sell! Sell! Sell! * Sell! Sell! Sell! Fucking sell! Sell! Sell! * Sell! Sell! Sell! Fucking sell! * Fucking sell! Sell! Fucking sell! (HORN BLARING) Watch out! Argh! Get out of my way, you two-bob fuckers! We've got vacs to shift! Come on! -(SCREECHING) -Two fucking miles an hour! Get out the way! We've got things to do! * Fucking sell! Sell! Sell! * -So, uh, d'you feel you'll get it, then? -Eh? The uh, Top Salesman of the Year. Two weeks in Benidorm. I'll kill meself if I don't. People say, "What commission you want?" I say, "I don't know, I don't care. "I'm on kamikaze commission." Ours is to sell or die! No one will do what I would do for a sale. No one. No one shifts what I shift... Except that Rottweiler in Blackpool. What's he called? Pockmark. Ah, he does some. You should see him, he looks like Jack Palance, but with skin of the alligator, skin of the alligator. He's done some. Otherwise they've no chance. They're all behind me. They're so little in the distance, they make me sick. Anyway, if they come too close to me, I'll bite them. Ahhh! (LAUGHING) -PETE: I gotta wee! I gotta wee! -Oh, for fuck's sake! (BRAKES SCREECHING) TOMMY: Oh, it will do your absolute lot. This is an amazing machine. Look at it. It'll go right round your seals, round your wheels. It'll do your carpets. This will get off every bit of grime. Any bit of grime, it will just suck it up. Look at it. Look. It lifts the felt, it lifts the nap. Lifts the nap... Get hold of it. You there. Now hold that. Look at the strength of that. It's amazing. It's not heavy at all. Look at my finger, look at that. Look. Listen to the strength of those wheels. You can even do your lawn with this. Look how light it is. Look at that. It rolls in like that, like a balloon. Look. (TYRES SCREECHING) -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Bye, Tommy! (TYRES SCREECHING) Quick detour to base. Do you know what it's like to work in a place where everybody hates you? -No. -Invigorating. Come on! Blue! -Pink. Wrong. -Nearly. -Nowhere near! -Who cares? I get a look. Cock-a-doodle-doo! -What's his problem? -I don't know. Where's the chicken house gone? I'm not sure. Nobody tells me anything. Only last week this was the chicken house. Three old broilers on telephones, smoking like chimneys, taking calls for leads between coughing fits. I'd put me head in the door like a rooster. They'd all squawk and squeal and call for the manager. It was only last fucking week! They've knocked it all into one. Look at it. It's socket city. (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS) What was that? (MUSIC STOPS) Bloody hellfire. Who's this? What was that? Hmm? Stonecheeks? And why do I feel like twenty pairs of frozen high heels have just walked across me grave? (SHUDDERING) It's Uki. She's here to set up website and Internet for us. Oh, I know. Fishnet Internet stockings at cyberknickers for I lap-top forward-slash- you lap-bottom dot co dot UK- org-orgy Benny Hill dot tits dot dot dot com. Great! Now then, what's the latest? How am I doing? -All right. -Anything else? Tommy, not harassing my staff again, are you? Not at all, Mr Ron. Just discussing with Miss Stonecheeks here, the latest progress and gen on the Golden Vac. Just thinking about what to move on my mantelpiece, what suntan oil to buy. The arrogance! It's not over yet, Rag. You all see the latest pile the Bond girl took through there? Doesn't mean you're a salesman. -Sales make a salesman. -I think there's a bit more to it than that. -Than what? -Than a spieler who operates without any ethics, -whatsoever, doing anything for a sale. -(LAUGHS) At least I'm honest. About what I do and how I do it. Not like the rest of you hypocrites. Walking into this place these days, you've got to watch out you don't skid on the smarm! (IN HUSKY VOICE) 'Tis yours. 'Tis yours. 'Tis you... (CLEARS THROAT) -Hello. -Eh? Pete. Remember? The other night? You gave me Throat's place. Oh, yeah, yeah. How are you doing? Keep it up, eh? (CHUCKLES) Nice to see you. Oh, yeah! (LAUGHING) TOMMY: And what's the idea of putting me with that lame health freak? -What do you mean? -In the last day's run-up to the competition, holding me back. He's returned. Not suitable material. Oh, you're returning him, are you? Oh, well, if you can't cope, I can always send him off with Randolph. Oh, no, no, no, no! Send some more if you want, do what you want. Cellotape a piece of dog crap to me cheek, I'll still sell more than all of you! Chain a cannon ball to me leg, I'll still win. And have the chain, the ball and the fucking cannon sold into the bargain! You think you've got all the answers with your big mouth and your outdated bloody, bloody blunderbuss tactics! -Now, now. -You will see. No, I won't. You don't like me, but you like my results. You'd sack me if you could, but you can't. So do one, Ron Ron, do one, Ron. (COMPUTER BEEPING) Bugger me. You live here? Where? I don't see habitation, unless you're Top Cat. -PETE: Here! This one here. -Where, where's an house? Next to the boarded up one. Here. (TYRES SCREECHING) Well, I thought mine was bad. You are poor. See you... Workhouse! (TYRES SCREECHING) -You all right? -Yeah, just Clayface was there again. -She's always there. -She's always staring. She's mad. I tell her to fuck off and go be Claywoman in an American comic book. Anyway, how'd it go? -(MUSIC PLAYING) -Good. -Good. -Good. Good? Is that it? (MUSIC PLAYING) Come on. I wanna know how you got on. You're back early. Oh, no! You've not been sacked, have you? Because I'm warning you, if you did... -No, no, I got dropped off. -By the bloke you're with? -Yeah. -What's he called? Uh... Tommy, Tommy Rag. -Is he all right? -He's great, yeah, nice bloke. Well, he'll be the first salesman that is. You'll need more gumption than this, Pete. I've got an idea to give it to you. Come here. Something to motivate you to the top like a rocket. Remember pussy cat? (PURRING) Not till you've made your first sale! No. Till you've made your first sale. (PURRING) (MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES) (TYRES SCREECH) (HORN BLARING CONTINUOUSLY) Come on, Workhouse! -What's rule number four? -I don't know. -Now, what's rule number four? -I don't know. Rule number fucking four, pal, is don't piss around keeping me waiting! Seconds lead to sales. Pockmark will have had his Puffa Puffa and be off the blocks by now. If you're not there next time, I'll fuck off and leave you, all right? (TYRES SCREECHING) Here, get that suit on, if you want to be with me. Go on! It's old one, but it's a favourite, so don't shit in it, right? (HORN BLARING) Shit! Shit! Fucking shit! Out with the rags! -You won't be needing those again! -PETE: Me coat! So, Tommy... -Yeah? -Can I sell today? -What? -On me own. -Go on. -You want to make as many sales as possible toward Benidorm. You can have mine, just let me make 'em. Um, you give me commission, or share, even share the commission. Go on, then. Sell in there. One thing, poor areas like this, get out when you're done. A clean cut. Rule fucking whatever. Take no sob stories, no hesitation. As quick as you can, withdraw, get out like a spent knob. Boot! (TYRES SCREECHING) 20 weeks. £2.12. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Yes? -I'm here to, uh, make life easier. -Oh? -I've something I'd like to talk to you about. -Come in. Fearful cold, isn't it? I've not turned the fire up too high. I owe all over. Sorry it's such a mess. It's hard when you're on your own and four children. PETE: It's a vacuum, see? -Uh... Can I plug it in? -If you like. There's a whatsit somewhere. The other one broke. Someone took it to fix but he never brought it back. -It does everything. -That's nice. This place could do with a good going over and right through. It's a mess. It's fearful hard to keep the house going. I've fearful little coming in. Me grandma, she's offered to take photos of me to send off to one of them filthy magazines. You get paid. There was a woman three streets away was one of them "reader's wives". People still ask for her autograph. Who ought to look at me in my fearful condition? Granny says there's a magazine called Bony Bints or something that might. I don't know. She's looking into it for me. She knows from her boyfriend. They call him Barbecue Herod. Do you know him? No. His fingers is like burnt sausages. Been in too many pies. I don't know how she lets him near her, I don't, really. Then where would we take 'em? Every room in this house is like this. Humble and shit. -Who'd want to look at a nude in such conditions? -This will help you clear up. Me grandma did it in the '50s. I've a photo of her somewhere. She's sitting astride a rolled-up carpet in a kitchen. Place is not bad, but you can just see the back end of a bicycle wheel, and there's washing up in the sink. -Where is it? -It's all right. About the cleaner... Okay. -Eh? -I'll take it. It's very nice, and from what you said, it should do the trick. I bought some books before off a man off the door. There they are over there. Kings And Queens Of England. I've never looked at them. I don't read well. But you know, a bargain's a bargain and, as I say, it's nice to know they're there. Then there's me tick, me telly and the Sky. You find that when your benefit comes in, all your debts go at it, like piglets at hogs. But you carry on. But I'm fearful honest about me debts. Don't worry, whatever it takes, I never miss. We've been on gravy and bread and I've never missed me catalogue. -(DOOR KNOCKING) -TOMMY: Only me! -Is that your boss? -Yeah. Let him in. TOMMY: Hello! Are you signing, then? -It'll help me clear up. -Just sign. He'll fill in the rest. I want it clean for me pictures. -Hmm? Pictures? -PETE: She's posing nude. To send off. I know about that. I've got a camera, if you want me to do it. Camera in the car. What, uh... What poses were you considering? No, it's okay. Me grandma's got one of those you don't need to send off to the developers. Fair enough. Enjoy your vac. There it stands. 'Tis yours. Look at it awhile before you use it. It's a beauty, isn't it? 'Tis yours. Goodbye. (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) You did it! You did it! Well done! -How does it feel? -Great. I feel great. I've done it. Oh, me pen. (WOMAN SOBBING) What are you looking for? -I wanted to see your camera. -Camera! I ain't got one. -You told her... -I'd have made one out of that Puffa Puffa Rice box just to get a free look. She won't know the difference. Anyway... (COUGHS) I'd have probably used me digital. Sad cow. Right, onwards! You're on your way, Workhouse! Hey, come back here! Okay, now you're no longer the virgin, now you've done your first sale, it's your exams. -Go through the rules! -(STUTTERING) Rule one, give no quarter. Rule two, good breakfast. Three, keep vaccocked. -Four, seconds lead to sales. Five, out like a spent knob. -What's rule number six? -I don't know. What? -Rule number six... There are no rules! You passed. See you, P-Pete! -(LAUGHING) -(TYRES SCREECHING) I've sold! I've sold, do you hear? I've sold! Did you sell? Yeah. The music. That's right. Come through. Hurry, hurry. The cat... (PURRING) Wants her milky cream. I can't. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Have I done summit? -No, can I come in? You can't afford it. I've come to take it back. Here you are. It's me last, but you have it... Not the kids. You. All right? Here you are, mate. You haven't got the time, have you? (GROANING) Fucking... Argh! -(BOYS LAUGHING) -Fuck off outta here! Fucking brilliant. Come on, lads. Fucking mad, fucking mad! Ah! (UNZIPPING) Sorry. Loser. PETE: Sheila? She's gone. Sheila! No! Sheila! Sheila! (SCREAMING) Clayface, where is she? Fucking hell. (WHISPERING) 1950. What? 1926. 1945. Oh, fucking hell! Stop! Fucking! (SCREAMING) Stop! (HORN BLARING) (SCREAMING) Help! (BANGING ON DOOR) Fucking hell! The lady downstairs has collapsed in there! She's in there all... Collapsed! And then there was fire! I put it out! I kicked her door! Oh, God, I didn't know! She's still lying there! She's in there! Dead! Dead, I tell you. Sheila's gone. (EXHALES) My Sheila left me. (CHUCKLES) I was in the street. I went in there. You came. I don't know what's happening. Say something. Superkalifragilistic- expeallydosious. Say it. Go on, say it! Dosiousexpeally- fragilistickalisuper. You're late! And you've got a partial picture of the 1966 England World Cup squad on your forehead. Uh, the late Bobby Moore and a quarter of Martin Peters, if I'm not mistaken. And on your chest, the Apollo 11 mission, and in your navel, can't quite make it out. It could be half of Diana Dors, could be the Millennium Dome. Then on each thigh, a singed suffragette, and three prime ministers and a Zeppelin on the shin. You're a veritable, tabby-eared and scorched scrapbook of the 20th century. I don't want to know why. I don't want to know how I've entered into Monty Python's missing sketch. I would just like to remind you that today is the day of the night the competition winner is announced. And as a consequence, all hands must be on deck, all stops must be pulled. -So get your fluttering arse in gear! -How? (GASPING) How can you talk like that when she's gone? Gone! She's left me and... Oh, God, oh, God! I know she'll never come back, and she is lying there! Christ! Clearly no sale in here. Another Stonecheeks bites the dust. Well, at least she's dead. Could be worse. Ill people make me sick. We'll have to phone an ambulance. -Bit late for that. -Police. Ugh! Can't we just leave her? No! All right, all right! (SIGHS) But we're wasting valuable time here. Pockmark would leave her for the rats and mice. (GROANS) I hate these fucking things! Electrified Mars Bars. I short them on a daily basis, you know. They won't work for me. I've got too much electricity in me brains. Come on! (SIGHS) A life... Like that. All gone. What's it all about? AUTOMATED VOICE: We are urgently trying to answer your call... I had a dream last night, Workhouse. I had a dream. Hmm. Came over the hill, and black and white people were having it off. No? (LAUGHING) Can't we cover her up, huh? Oh, come on! I did have a dream. I saw that Oriental bint from the office. She was, like... Walking on air. She was pushing a vac and that was, like, on air. And as she walked, like magic in her trail, she left smart young girls behind her, talking into mics at their mouths, like Madonna. And all faces aglow in front of the computer screens. I couldn't get it. It was seductive, you know, as if something was being gathered, like, softly guided in. Not like my selling, not like the selling we know and hate. And at the last computer screen, she stepped in... And I went in after. It was a tropical beach, blue sky, sea, but it... It was more than that. It was all alive... Like heaven. Somehow I felt like all me work was done, you know, there were no more vacuums left for me to sell. And when I looked, she'd gone. The vac was all alone on the beach. Gold it was, glittering in the sand, and I was going up and down the beach with it. I think it was plugged into the sun or something. I felt odd at first, but no fever. The fever was gone. And then I got used to meself. I all opened up inside, like a flower. It was so beautiful. I started crying. There was tears everywhere. I was completely nude. I was vacuuming completely nude in paradise. AUTOMATED VOICE: We are urgently trying to answer your call... Now, Workhouse. Get upstairs, get the 20th century off you and get dressed now! -OPERATOR: Which service do you require? -Emergency. -OPERATOR: Which service do you require? -Emergency! OPERATOR: Which service do you require? Please, which service do you require? Hello? Emergency. OPERATOR: Hello? (TRAIN TOOTS) This day is going nowhere! (SIGHS) Come on! I'm losing ground. I feel like me heels is in a pillow. I know! (TYRES SCREECHING) PETE: Where are we going? -(HORN BLARING) -To a sale that's nearly made. I'm a feeling a stroke away and I'm having it today! We're going to see the Spaniard. Adios, Tommy. HOT POT: Why do you do this? We're not Spanish. We are somewhere. -We've got tango blood and jet black hair. -Your hair's grey. You've only been like this since that salesman came round, told you you had a Spanish look. He only said that to sell you a vacuum cleaner. -You're just jealous. -It's all to get a sale. (SCOFFS) El rubbisho! -Buy one then. -I shall when I am ready. And I know what you did upstairs. He was just giving me a demonstration, that is all. -It's all to sell. -Oh, shut up! At least he comes. Nobody comes for you, do they? You fatty virgin! (DOORBELL CHIMES) -Thomas! -Spaniard! Here it is, the little white bull. Um, can we just try it upstairs on the carpet again, -you know, before I make my final decision? -If we must. If we must. SPANIARD: Have you warned him she's slow? TOMMY: He's not so quick himself! (LAUGHING) * Sister, sister * Are you that salesman's friend? Do you like my legs? They feel heavy. -Do you know a chocolate rep called Terence? -No. He was her friend before. Her Milk Tray man. -(CHUCKLES) -Oh. I'm touched. Oh? Do you want a drink? Coffee. Pour us two glasses of that Shangri-La. (TOMMY GRUNTING) Oh, no, I forgot the Sangria. Never mind it. I trust you're signing today. Oh, let us leave it till later. I want amour, Tommy. Mucho, mucho amour! Amour! Oh, Tommy, more! Amour! Oh, Tommy! (BURPS) (BED SQUEAKING) You're sad, aren't you? I am, yes. -I can tell moods. -(LAUGHING IN DISTANCE) -SPANIARD: Oh, Tommy! Tommy! -(TOMMY MOANING) If I show you my bra, will it cheer you up? I always wear a sexy one. It's big, though. (CLATTERING RHYTHMICALLY) (YELLING) (PANTING) (MOANING) (GRUNTING AND HUFFING) Look! -(GROANING) -(LAUGHING AND JEERING) TOMMY: Don't mind us. Get back on! (BOTH LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) -(DOOR SHUTS) -Oh. TOMMY: Jezebel! (LAUGHING) -Oh! -Ah! Darling! Oh! -Oh, adios! -Adios! Adios, Tommy! Conquistador, or what? Anything, anything, anything, anything for a sale! (LAUGHING) Oh! What's happening to me? What's happening to me? Shut up or I'll fucking hit you! Go on, then, kill me. I want to. What have I done? -Go in the dash. There'll be something in there. -I don't want anything! I don't want a fucking thing out of the dash! I fucking hate you! -(TYRES SCREECHING) -Listen, you! I'm gonna give you one chance to pull yourself together. If you don't fucking take it, I'm fucking off and leaving you, right! I shagged the slow girl! So what? Tonight's my night. The Vac of Gold! I know I'm taking it, but I wanna take it in style, with a handful of sales still in me hand. -What was that? -A hitchhiker. No, it's not, you blockhead. It's an opportunity! Never miss an opportunity! I've sold to hitchhikers before now, left them two junctions later, clutching their vac of their very own, not knowing what the fucking dandoozle's gone on. Hello, young man, your lift is here. Come in. -What's your name? -De Kid. -Oh, hello! I'm De Tommy Rag. -You're a salesman. -How did you guess? -No one else is so loud in the mornings. -(LAUGHING) What do you do? -Guess. No, no, I'll give you a clue. No one sits when I'm in a room. -Are you a royal? -Close. -I'm a DJ. -Oh, aye! He likes that. Don't you? -Where are you going? -Blackpool. Me going there tonight. Big prizes. What are you doing there? A gig. There you are. He's doing a jig like what you like. His bird's dumped him. She were a stripper, you know. Look, before you get settled in, how do you go about cleaning your carpet at home? -(SCOFFS) I ain't got no home. -Where do you sleep? Hotels, motels, car seats, back streets, teepees, warehouses, shithouses, or I stay up all night. -Where are you from? -I don't know. Bloody hell, I've picked up Oliver Twist. All I know is I'm northern, I have no carpet and I have no mat. Our vacuums do other things, you know. Why? Maybe I could sample them. Set them off in Ibiza. (BEATBOXING) Big fish, little fish, cardboard box. BOTH: Big fish, little fish, cardboard box! Night of 100 vacs! Vacuuming completely nude in paradise. Oh, well I haven't got time for this. Thank you, very much here, right now. Sling your hook, pal. Take no offence. I won't sell you out. Fuck off! Pit stop. You coming? -See you, J Edgar. -Eh? Hoover. Did he mean it? I mixed a bit. You know, I was learning meself, like bedroom DJ. -Who taught you? -The crowd. Right. Oh, yeah, right. How did you start? There was an old DJ down the road from me selling a big, clunking 1970s disco twin deck for 50 quid. I sold my bike for 60, bought it and with the tenner, I got three records. They're all I had for ages. I wore 'em thin. I took the pads off my fingers with practise. Look. Smooth as marbles. Police can't arrest me now, unidentifiable. Except, by me music. Then I did a gig. One gig went to another gig to another gig to gig to gig. I'll do whatever comes. Basements, clubs, warehouses, bar mitzvahs! -(LAUGHS) -It doesn't matter what I had to start with. I can get from Amazing Grace to Abba to ambient to hard house before they know what's happened. I mix up a potion. I make 'em feel better. I guarantee to get the most miserable twat out there or your money back. -Do you make a living? -I only want the money so I can open my own club. -Your own club? -Yeah. -What's it gonna be called? -The Ark. Everybody's welcome. It will never close. You can stay in there until you feel it's safe to come out again. Top! Can I ask you something, De Kid? Can I... -Will you listen to my mix? -No. I can't hear a thing without the people. Tell you what, though... I'll play it for you tonight. Least you know it's being danced to. (WHISPERING) I'll give you a secret. Silence is loud. (DOOR FLINGS OPEN) Boot! (BOOT POPS OPEN) Let me hit Stonecheeks with these before the witching hour. And then I insist you accompany me to Blackpool and the great give-away show. * Now I've been happy lately * Thinking about the good things to come * And I believe it could be * Something good has begun * I've been smiling lately * Dreaming about the world as one * And I believe it could be Someday it's going to come * Out on the edge of darkness * TOMMY: Workhouse, me old lub! (CHUCKLING) We're riding to Blackpool! To Mecca! Metropole Hotel on the front. I swung by to pick the girls up. In the sad end... (LAUGHS) I've no one else to bring! Hot Pot came too, see? She's not been out for years. She come for I told her you were coming. Anyway, I'm the goddamn winner and I want some champagne. Get out the dash there. Come on! Oh, there is none. -Is there not? -No. -Is there, is there some hotel miniatures? -There are. Near enough. Come on. Smack 'em open. Let's celebrate. -(LAUGHING) -What will you do if you lose? I will win! -Spaniard, do you want to hear my speech? -Si, si, si. Mr Ron and all the rest of you scum, I would like very much, very much like to thank you. For without your rejection and wish for me to topple, I would not have made it to the sun lounger in the sun I will soon be occupying, or to this exalted height I now hold as best fucking salesman in the universe ever! Bravo! You thought I did it alone. I did not. You don't know how much you helped me climb that ladder. Your hatred was the rungs. Each stab in the back made Tommy scurry up all the higher, each time Stonecheeks did not bung me a lead, I took off and scavenged, robbed, dug up ten of me own. So, ta. A mighty ta to all you rats and mice at the good old office. Thanks must also go to Little Al's dad. Little Al's dad down the street when I was a nipper. Al's da, the salesman. He sold flying saucers. That soft, perfect, almost paper, sweet, you know, that exploded in your mouth. Oh, when it hits the back of your throat! He'd give 'em out to us, tossed 'em, tossed 'em, we caught 'em. Pale pink and green and yellow, flying through the sky. And thanks must go to my dad, who showed me the mug's way, so early, so clearly, coming home in filth, having worked all the hours God could spare, for tuppence ha'penny. Beat. Bad-tempered. Broken. And thanks to him also for making me hate to hesitate. Little me, upstairs in bed... (THUDS) -While he hit Mum downstairs. -(MAN SCREAMING) "One more time," I'd say. "One more scream and I'll get the poker." But I didn't. I've never hesitated since. I've never crushed up regret since. I should have broken his dirty, oil-stained fingers off in the door. And I thank him for his face... (CHUCKLES) When I'd come home after a few hours spieling. "The whole set, darling. No, I don't want your £10, nor your five. "Put your notes away. I don't know what's come over me. "Eight and six, the lot. Hurry before they carry me off to the loony bin." (LAUGHING) And I'd throw a wad, ten of his wage packets, thick, on the kitchen table for me Mum. He couldn't look at us! He couldn't finish his food because I'd beaten him with success and so I go on beating them, for I do not lose. And finally, thanks must go most of all to all the suckers I've mugged through the years, who I've left dizzy and light of pocket, holding something they never needed or wanted, with a "'Tis yours!" "'Tis yours!" "'Tis yours!" Oh, I am so proud! MR RON ON SPEAKER: Your growth and the company's growth, fuelled by honesty... Honesty! (APPLAUDING AND CHEERING) We have had... We have had a stupendous year so far. We are riding high as one of the top regions in the country. (CROWD CHEERING) Fucking hurry up. I want to get abroad. And so, without further ado, let's find out the winner. I'm going to ask one of our brightest female members of staff to be so kind and do us the honours and read them out. Please welcome Uki, the head of our new Information Technology department. (WHISTLING AND APPLAUDING) The final nominees for the Golden Vac awards are... -Tommy Rag. -(SCATTERED APPLAUSE) MAN 1: Good lad, Tommy! MAN 2: Nice one, son! Throat. (CROWD ROARING) And Randolph Doleen. Pockmark. (CROWD ROARING) Pockmark! And the winner is... The winner is... Rand... Sorry, Pockmark. (ALL CHEERING) And in second place, it's a tie with Throat and Tommy Rag. (INDISTINCT) Winner! Yes, yes, yes! (9 TO 5 PLAYING) * I wake up every morning I stumble out of bed * Stretching and a-yawning Another day ahead * It seems to last forever And time will slowly ride * Till babe and me's together Then it starts to fly * 'Cause the moment that he's with me Time can take a flight * The moment that he's with me Everything's all right * Night-time is the right time We make love * Then it's his and my time We take up! * My baby takes the morning train * He works from nine... * Stop, cheats! -(WOMEN SHRIEK) -What are you doing? Pervert! Where's Ron Ron? Where is he? -I'm not telling you. -You'd fucking better! Why? What will you do? Boot you in the vagina! Oh, what the hell, I owe him nothing. He's took Susie Wong for a walk down the prom to talk about the future. Big changes. This is gonna be the last competition, but no one knows it. You know, he reckons with her help they can clear twice as much on the cyber highway as you lot can on the tarmac one. -It's death of the salesman. -Never mind all that shite. What happened? What fucking happened? -Your sales were one short. -Never! Yeah. One of the sales was nulled and the vacuum went missing. No. -Workhouse! -(SLAMS DOOR) What about Throat, how could I have tied with a dead man who couldn't talk? Why not tell you? What do I care, now he's got his geisha? (SCOFFS) As you got closer and closer to winning, he got more desperate. He started to scheme to get the others to donate sales to the Throat Memorial. Not strictly allowed, but he's the boss. Honesty, eh? Honesty. You... (MUSIC PLAYING) Big fish, little fish, cardboard box! Big fish, little fish, cardboard box! Come on! Yes! Listen. Watch. Watch your music weave and work and weave. Behold. Me music! (MUSIC STOPS) Come on! One time only! I can sell you this. I can sell vacuums to vacuum salesmen. This time, it's the one-off forever bargain. All appliances thrown in. My soul's included. My life's work. The bag is full of Australian shoes lodged in my flesh and blood! (GRUNTING) (WHIP CRACKING) (SCREAMING) -Steward! -(GRUNTING) -Get him out. -And Tommy, you're sacked. Get him out. CROWD: (CHANTING) Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) -No one was listening at the beginning. -I know. -Now everyone's listening. -I know. See, see? I knew you was the one to watch. Whoo! (COUGHING) (LAUGHING) Sea! Do you want a vac? Hoover your bottom, take up all the jewels and wrecks and rotting sailor boys! I'll do you a massive deal, sea. I'll knock off twice as much for you, sea! May I call you Briney? May I? Come on! Come on! You want one. You know you want it. Come on! You must... You must have one! Come on! Take it. (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) Argh! Hey! Hey! You don't have to vac me heart up! (GASPS) I... I can taste blood... Tommy! And flying saucers. Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy...
