Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the day we’ve all been waiting for. It’s time for the final night of the championship! Introducing, of our first contenders from the night from United States of America James Howards. And now His opponent from India The slumdog of the streets of Mumbai, the chaiwala Liger! To make a man’s life hell, God lovingly made these dolls called women. And this here is one such doll. I hate her. But I still keep running after her. I need to tell you all what really happened. But I don’t know how to narrate a story. Even then, I’ll try to narrate it. Move it! What is this? It’s a tea stall. -Did you get the permission This area is mine. So, pay me a weekly rent. Weekly rent. I won’t say it. -What did you say? You are going to feel bad about it. Tell me! Hey! Why are you creating a ruckus out here? You think this place belongs to your father? Did your mother bequeath it to you or did your grandfather pass it down? What do you think of us?! We are straight from the heart of Karimnagar. We’ll put chilli powder in your eyes and electrocute your bottom. Oh God! Stop sharpening it. Do you know who I am? My name is Mallesh. I don’t think he is someone who will listen. Take out the weapons! Brother! Brother! Look, brother! Please save me, brother. Please, -Are you crazy? These are daddy’s men. They will kill you. I don’t know him. Do you want to beat him? Beat him Dear! Catch him. Brother! Brother! Brother! Wait. Come on, just wait up. Ever since I was little, I always prayed to God. I know how God looks like. But, today, I can see the presence of God in you. You are my God. What’s your name, brother? Why are you smiling at me instead of telling me your name? Brother, you saved my life. I am not going to move from here without finding out your name. What is your name, brother? Li, Li, Li.. Li.. What? -You stutter? How is it that you look so good but sound so horrible?! Were you stuttering since your childhood or is it a recent development? Brother, if I told people that I was saved by someone who stutters this badly, they are going to laugh at me. Instead of dragging it along Why don’t you just say your name out all at once? Brother is going to tell us his name. Go on and applaud him. K,K, I will kill you, jerk! Don’t ,don’t, ,show yourself to me ever! [Stutter] Don’t you get what he’s trying to say? He’s telling you to get,.get!get out of here! -Brother!brother! Don’t show yourself to him. Don’t disturb him. I am from Karimnagar as well. My parents and in-laws are from Karimnagar. Don’t you know how dangerous we are? Get out of here. Brother, I am from Karimnagar as well. We are all the same. We should get along well with each other. Don’t you think so? Why did you come from Karimnagar to Mumbai? Who are you looking for? Ma,ma, (Stutter) I want to meet the master. Wh,wh,why? What did you say? What the hell did you say? Tell me, what did you say? You said something. Ch,Ch, I need to meet Christopher Master. No, you changed it. I don’t believe you. Say it out loud. -Ganpath. Master. I will deal with you later. Sir, my name is Balamani. We came from Karimnagar. This is my son. I want to see him as an MMA National Champion. I’ve heard people say that you are the appropriate person to teach him. That is why we left everything behind and came here. Do you know what MMA means? Yes, Mixed Martial Arts. What is your name? Li,Li, Li,Liger. Tiger? No, it’s not Tiger. It’s Liger. He was born to a Lion and a Tigress. That is why we named him Liger. My son is a cross-breed, sir. Do you know Martial arts? A lit, A lit, A little. What did you learn? Je,Je,Je, Jeet Kune Do The same style as yours. Alright, there are brochures outside. There are details regarding the fees in them. Pay the fees and I’ll begin teaching him. We don’t have any money, sir. You need to teach him for free. Teach him for free? Listen, madam. I am not doing an act of social service. Absolutely no chance of teaching him for free. I am sorry. Please try your luck elsewhere. Do you remember the 2004 National MMA championship, sir? That was the first match you had ever lost in your life. Balram defeated you in the semi finals and went on to the finals. But he died in a knock out. That Lion Balram, was my husband. Before he went to the finals, he told me something. And now, my son says the same thing. I couldn’t see my husband as a champion. At the least, I should see my son as a champion. I am saying this once again, sir. We don’t have money to pay you. He will stay right here. He’ll do anything and everything that you ask him to. You are our sole hope. Liger. How do you see yourself? Wh, what? When you look at yourself in the mirror, who do you see? Fighter. That is the only thing that I can say without stammering. I, was born to a fighter. and I grew up with another fighter. I am going to leave this world as a fighter. Because I, I’m a fighter. My, my, My name is Liger. I like your confidence. But there is an arrogance that lies underneath that confidence. Tame it. Remember one thing. Mother and Father can only name you. But it’s up to the son to live up to his name. From tomorrow onwards, learn the work around here. I will think on it and decide on when to start your training. One more thing, I have a rule. Focus. Focus on Martial Arts. Stay away from girls. I don’t know any girls. I, I don’t want a girl. I’ve become the girl who stole your heart. I can bring the chills with just a little smile. I am a little bit of good and a little bit of crazy. Won’t the tiger be seduced by my looks? I am the girl who stole your heart. I am the one. I shaped myself according to your tastes. I like myself as me. The one who tries to mess with me is going to be killed. I am not some ordinary girl that you can mess with. The world is going to know all about it very soon. Write it down and keep a picture of me with you. My name is going to ring in every street. I’ve become the girl who stole your heart. I can bring the chills with just a little smile. I am a little bit of good and a little bit of crazy. Won’t the tiger be seduced by my looks? Circumstances are not the same for anyone One day is yours; the next day is mine, God knows who is going to hunt and who going to die. Li,Li,Liger. Who is that on your T-shirt? Ma, Ma, Ma, Mark Anderson. Mark Anderson? Legend. Why do you bother with those legends? Why? You are merely an office body. Nothing but trash. You want to learn martial arts? First, learn how to clean properly. You didn’t wipe here. Right here. Wipe it. Not with that. Take that T-shirt off and wipe it. Didn’t you understand? This one,this one here, Mark. What did you say? What did you say? We got what he said. In fact, we understood it quite well. You understood? There he goes again, cussing us out. You are merely an office boy. How dare you cuss us out? Are you getting angry because I called you a stutterer? Someone who stutters is called a stutterer. Someone who cannot see is called a blind. But those who provoke people that’s wrong, brother. We will go on provoking. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? If you gift me something, I will gift you something in return as well. If you ki, If you give me a kiss, I will smooch you. Get up. What are you going to give me? What are you going to? What’s happening here? He is using profanities against us, sir. Did you cuss him? What did you say? I, I used his mother, sister and wife to cuss him. Did you see what he did right in front of your eyes, sir? Out! Let’s deal with it later. Let’s go. I know why you cussed them. They insulted you. There is nothing great about reacting to them by cussing them out. What’s great is controlling your anger. Wh,what can I do if they provoke me?! Keep your control. The entire world is the same. At first, they will ignore you. After that, they will insult you. Next, they will fight with you. And then you win. If you can’t take this, go back to Karimnagar. Now clean the f*** floor! Let’s get this over with. Brother. Scoundrel! He is giving us the finger. Who? Who the hell is doing that? There he is. That one there. -What? Go and beat them all up. No! Step aside. Move, No, stop! Back! Master, were you scared? I don’t know why but when I see you, I feel like beating you up. You are training in Dojo Run. Is this what you teach your students? Yes, this is exactly what I teach my students. What are you going to do? There are certain ethics in Martial arts. And you possess none of them. You are stain on the honour of martial arts. What the hell are you saying, old man?! My Master. D,Don’t touch. How dare you grab my collar? Do you know who I am? Sanju,My name is Sanju. Let go! We won’t let you off so easily. I am going to kill all of you. Hey, Master. Come! Tube lights! Try and think of ways to increase the follows on social media. Even if I post a stupid video, there must be a million likes. A million? Listen, you know, I need a solid fan base. Just talk to all the influencers. Come up with an idea. Some hashtags, captions or bio. All the young boys must go crazy about me. Listen. If you post some steamy content, the boys will surely go crazy. Won’t my face be the crowd puller? Boys check out women from the bottom up. Face isn’t the first thing that attracts them. If you post the correct video, Exactly! What do you want? An,.espresso. Single shot or a double. Do,Do,Do, Alright, alright. I got it. Bro, two double. What else? I saw him somewhere. Who? That one there. We don’t know who he is. No, no. I saw him somewhere. -No. Hold my latte. Hello? Excuse me? Hello? Mr? Aren’t you the one who always comments negatively to everything I post? Don’t lie. I saw your DP. Hold on. The very same beard and hair. I know everything. I, I, -Don’t say a word! What was it that you said? What was it? You said that I was out of shape. What’s happening? -And I don’t look good at all. Do I look like a buffalo to you?! Do you know this? Every inch of my body is in a perfect ratio. Get a tape and measure it. Look. Why is she doing like this? Hey, what are you looking at? Hey! Don’t say anything. I will pluck your eyes out. Tanya, he’s saying that you are mistaken. Tanya, let him go. -Let’s go. J K D. Didn’t I tell you? He is my enemy. He purposefully comments negatively on all my posts. Idiot! JKD? Sanju. Sanju is my brother. If I tell him about you, he is turn you into pulp. Sanju. My name is Sanju. Where is he? That’s the guy. -Look there. That’s him. Come here. Come. I’ll kill you if you don’t come. Come. Liger. Liger? -What does that mean? Who will hit him? Why would so many of you want to go at once? He is a guy with mental issues! Look. He’s someone who picks a fight with everyone. Exactly! -Beat that guy up! Sir, just one chance. Sir, give me a chance. Shankar. -Yes, master. Hit him. Liger, block him and push back. But don’t hit him. Start. Hey, let’s go and take a look. -Let’s go. Let’s go. This looks like a Kung Fu movie. Is he Chinese? Master, give me one chance. One chance. Just one chance. What’s happening here? No matter how many poses you make, you will be beaten to pulp. Ganpath. Master. Me? Go! Wait. Liger. Now you can hit back. Fight. How dare you hit me? If you don’t hit him, our reputation will be in tatters. I beg you, just beat him up. Beat him up. Now, he’s really going to be beaten up. Wow! OMG How awesome! -He is doing a fabulous job. He is a hero. Such a solid man! Come on, break his arms and legs! He is really a good return on investment. What an amazing performance. He is a hit. A super hit! Sir, tell me. -I saw your son fight. He has a lot of potential. He is strong. And he is a brave young man. Watching him fight, I am reminded of his father Balram. Anyway, from tomorrow onwards, I am going to start his MMA training. I will forever be grateful to you, sir. Tell him to focus. Okay! Yes, Master. -For sure. Son,son, Master just called me. He told me that, from tomorrow onwards, he’s going to teach you MMA. What did you do? Why is he singing such high praises of you? I,I, -You must have done something noteworthy. But son, from tomorrow onwards, your life is going to be changed. Just focus well. I am focusing, aren’t I? -Yes, yes. Keep at it. But make sure no devil gets close to you. What,what do you mean? -Wait, I’ll tell you. Son, the devils look like Well, they don’t look like devils. They look like angels that have come down from heaven, just for you. As soon as you look at her you might feel that she is the younger sister of the dancing angels in heaven. Watching their acting skills, you would want to present them with an Oscar and will your properties away to them. Can I come? Please? They wear such short clothes, wear lipstick, leave their hair loose and walk about seductively. Those are the ‘devils’. In my youth, ‘devils’ were really much better. The ‘devils’ of today come straight into your house. Once they get inside the house, the house is going to be ruined. They put on innocent faces, Look all wide-eyed and in awe, and trap you smoothly. Come. They are very dangerous. You must be very careful with them. Son, if you are not on guard, they will wink at you and lead you into alleys. They can burn down a house without fire. They look deep into your eyes. And deliberately tremble their lips. That ends up seducing people. Son, you must not be seduced. So sorry. Really, sorry. Look deep in my eyes. You forgave me, didn’t you? Please say yes. Please. If you are seduced, you are as good as dead. I’ve insulted you. I am an idiot. Please take my number. Give me your mobile. Oh goodness! What drama queens! They make all sorts of calculations in their favour. When they decide that you are the perfect scape goat then they give you their number. They start chatting on WhatsApp. They never let you sleep. They never let you get any work done. If you don’t Like their Facebook page, they make a scene. If you don’t see their Instagram pictures, they make a scene. It’s as good as giving them control over your entire life. Son -Mo-mother. Do you know how it feels when you are intoxicated by them? Your brain wouldn’t work. You can’t study, You will have no appetite. And you forget about home. If parents counsel you for your benefit, it doesn’t get through. It doesn’t matter if there are or aren’t people supporting you. You would feel that all you need is her. It’s as good as your ruin. That will be the end of it all. I know it’s too soon. But I have a suspicion that I am in love with you. Is it true? If she has a better match, she will say that her parents aren’t supportive of the relationship, and make you lose your dignity. And head off to greener pastures. This is how they are. WhatsApp me. I need to tame this Liger. This young man looks at me with those hungry eyes. He caught me. He cast a spell on me and set me on fire. He got the flag of love and planted it in the heart He made her way into me and changed me. Why am I being blamed? My lovely lollipop, This youth of yours. This youth of yours. This youth of yours. This youth of yours. I want to be entwined with you. I want to kiss you. And you have no right to stop me. I'll surrender myself to you. I want to conquer you. With you beside me, I'll be at ease always. If you ask, will I say no? You are my heart beat. This youth of yours. This youth of yours. This youth of yours.

Bruce Lee was a philosopher. He studied philosophy in San Francisco. He is the founder of Jeet Kun Do and MMA , Mixed Martial Arts. The biggest and most popular sport in the world. Boxing, Karate, Jujutsu, Muay Thai all these are part of MMA. It’s a bloody deadly contact sport. Are you ready? -Yes, sir. (Stutter) Yes, sir. It doesn’t matter if you are slow of speech. Your punches should never be late. What did you understand? (Stutter) Get in the ri-ring and break them. (chants) How lovely you look. What’s your name, dear? Tanya. I wonder if youngsters like you do exist in the world of today. Hearing you sing is making me feel like I’m enjoying the cool air from the Air Conditioner on a summer day. You sang just like M.S. Subba Lakshmi. M.S. Subba Lakshmi sang this song. I was lip syncing to it. Lip? What does that mean? This is a special video created for Diwali on social media. Social media? -Yes. My ID is Tanya_thestar. If you go to Instagram, you can check out my videos, like them and even follow me. If you want a selfie, I will give it to you right now. That’s cause, later on, I will not be available. You! Don’t let me catch you. When I heard the song earlier, I wanted you to come into my house as my daughter-in-law. You look like goddess Lakshmi. But your deeds are horrible. Aunty, what are you saying? What else can I say? You come into the temple, take off your clothes and make videos for social media. Don’t you have any shame? As a punishment for you up raising you this way, your parents’ bones need to be broken. No matter how I am, how does it matter to you? Don’t provoke me! You didn’t see another side of me. I did. I saw all your angles. No matter what poses you give, no man is going to fall for you. Why wouldn’t it happen? I already have a boyfriend. You do? Really? He is going to get married to me. If he marries you, he is as good as dead. Looking at you, I feel that it applies to you as well. Your husband must already be dead! How dare you? You tramp! Come! -Aunty! Come! Mother Leave me. What happened? Mother,mother, Shut up! I am sorry, aunty. -Let go of me. Promise me. Promise me. Get yourself anyone else. But never get this tramp into our house. I am going to kill her right now. I’ll kill you. Okay.. okay Brother, you’ve shocked us. She’s never fallen for anyone in the entire city. How did you get her to fall in love with you? What did you do? -I didn’t do anything. She-she just fell for me. Such a success makes us want to celebrate today. That jerk Sanju treated us like bugs. The other day just because one of our boys spoke to his sister, Sanju broke his leg. Master doesn’t allow us to retaliate either. The time has come for us to ride a bicycle on top of his Benz car. Brother, go ahead and enjoy yourself. Have as much fun as you can. That’s wrong. That girl is really,. That girl is really goo-goo-goo, Just a minute!just a minute. Let’s be a little blunt. How did you make that girl fall in love with you despite stammering? I don’t know. Did you guys ever talk or are you just communicating with each other through text messages? Does that girl know you stammer? I d-d-don’t know. If that’s the case, don’t tell her. Just go on and have as much fun with her as possible. You’re getting a call!a call! I will put it on speaker Hi, Liger. The entire day today was a disturbing. Iam so sorry. Let’s go to the pub in the evening? Let’s party super hard. Ye-ye- Yes, we are coming. Let’s party hard. She said let’s party hard. Let’s go. Buddy, let’s party hard. I’ll be back after using the washroom. Excuse me, where is the washroom? Who are you going to complain to now? How dare you piss me off? Excuse me? Excuse me? Sanju and his gang are in there. They are horribly bullying someone in there. I am quite scared. I don’t understand what’s happening. Let’s get out of here. Let’s go. No, buddy,Don’t. Let’s just go. I’ll pee outside. Buddy, please listen to me. How dare you mess with Sanju? With Sanju? Where are you going? -No one in this city dares cross me! Go and complain to whoever you want to. Get up! Speak now. Please. -Hit the, Hey, Bloody cheap fellows. What the hell are you doing here? We, we, we were invited. Who could have invited you? Si-Si- Our friend Chaitanya called us over to attend his birthday party. Let’s go. Why would you just blurt out that it’s his sister who invited us? There are just the two of us. There are ten of them there. They will beat us up. They are very dangerous. Forget about the party. Let’s go. Liger? Where are you going? Liger. Baby. Hi. Sorry, baby. I didn’t know that she’s your mother. If I knew she’s your mother, I would have kissed her. Sorry, that was an unnecessary fight. See, I am sad. That is why I am drinking. Where’s my drink? I need to sp-speak to you. What happened? Come. Si-sit down. (stutter) I sta-stammer. Did you know that? Oh God! That is what I like about you. Re-really? Yo-you like me? I googled it.

Last night, there were two people who came from JKD. They were Liger and Ganpath. Who amongst the both of them is it? Ganpath. Really? -Really. I swear. Ganpath? -Yes. I am unable to keep explaining it to you. These days, its very easy to beat up anyone. When that person keeps talking on the phone and walking alone at night, that is when you cover their head in a sack and beat him up. It’s quite simple. Who? Who are all you people? Where are you taking me? Tell me. Careful, young man. Sit down. What happened, young man? Who beat you up? How would I know who they are when they put a sack on my face and beat me up? Why did they hit you? I don’t know, sir. I suspect that they beat you up on purpose. Looking at them, I suspect it’s them. They must have beat you up. Hey, I'm hurting Hi, baby.

If you are brave enough, tell her that you love her without stammering, right in front of everyone here. That is when I will give my sister to you. Liger, tell me. I, Liger! Say that you love her. Say that you love her. Why are you showing them your anger? Tell her that you love her. Will you tell her or not? If that’s the case, tell her. I, I lo, lo, Lov, lov, love, Bro, We are just wasting our time with this stammering buffoon! Let’s thrash him. I- love Lo,love you. I.. love.. you. Damn! You’ve ruined your reputation over that girl. What did she do for you? Did she stand up for you or speak for you? Don’t you understand? She left you because you stammer. Let her go! Good riddance! What does she know of your value? If she really has courage, tell her to give birth to a brave man like you. It would take a few lifetimes. May she be dead! What a horrible girl! Son, everyone has flaws. If you win, no one will notice your flaws. If successful, a short person will seem tall and a dark-skinned person would look fair skinned too. Everyone keeps pointing fingers at you that you are a stammerer. Tomorrow, your words will sound like a song. You must make sure that they feel like your words are song. Did I chase after you? Who was the one who chased? Was it me or was it you? Hey stop! Why.. Why did you Why-Why did you betray me? Did I betray you? You were the one who betrayed me. Why didn’t you tell me that you stammer? I didn’t tell you? -No, you didn’t. That day, I told you in the pu-pu-pub, didn’t I? Which day? What did I say? You.! Stop! You stammering * Hold on. -Move! Step aside. You told me you liked my stammering in the pub You told me that I was cu-cute. I was drunk! I don’t remember a thing. Anyways, this conversation is pointless. I would never get married to someone like me. Why? What if I get married to you tomorrow and I give birth to someone like you? I can’t deal with this shit! I am on a totally different level in the social scale than you are. I am a bloody star! I am going to Hollywood to pursue my career in acting. Stay away from my life! Come on, Sanju. Leave him. Go and make tea. Bloody loser. What if I get married to you tomorrow and I give birth to someone like you? Did you see that? The stick broke into two. Not just your body, your heart needs to become stronger as well. There are many things that will happen to us in life. To withstand all that, your heart needs to turn into a stone. We never cry for the ones who love us. We cry for those that do not love us. Men keep complaining that “that girl didn’t love me”, “this girl didn’t love me”, etc. Is that really love? Think about it, Liger. Come out. The championship is ready and waiting. Everyone is eager to prove themselves in the ring. Lion Balram and Balamani’s son. Liger. Get up, you fool! Get up! Come on, If you want to survive, you must win. Get up. Come on, get up. If you want to fly, you must burn with passion. Get up, come on. Get up! Buddy, you were born to win. Make the world pay you your dues. If you remember that, don’t distract yourself with anything else. There will be no one left to oppose you. Let’s go, Liger. I am the best Don't mess with me Let my brother come he will pulp you up If the sweat doesn’t drop, what’s the point? If the blood doesn’t boil, what’s the point of having blood? If your life doesn’t make you move, what’s the point of being alive? What’s the point of being courageous if you don’t show it? If your heart doesn’t burn, what’s the point of having it? What’s the point of having a flag if you don’t plant it? If your opponent is one step ahead and you are trailing behind, Make a ruckus, throw them down and beat them up. Buddy, you were born to win. Make the world pay you your dues. If you remember that, don’t distract yourself with anything else. There will be no one left to oppose you. Control yourself Control yourself Liger (Commentary) This is going to be his last day. Watch how I’m going to beat him up. This is your last day. Sanju is my brother. You are going to lose. (Commentary) Come on, Liger. Come on, man! (Commentary) This has been an even match so far between both the fighters. Both the fighters are in search of that one mistake from their opponent on which they can capitalize. Sanju, hit him. -Sanju, hit him. Deal with him! You can’t do anything to my brother. My brother is a winning horse. My brother, the winner. Don't leave him. Hit him! Hit, Watch. Liger! What did we just witness? Sanju still went ahead with the attack. And again, the teams have to intervene to get these two separate from each other. Tea seller, go and get back to making tea. You are a loser. A loser. Let me go. Unbelievable, David! Unbelievable! Oh! Both were given a final warning by the referee with a yellow card (Commentary) And we are ready to go again! Amazing visuals! Both the fighters have started in an attacking mode. David, none of them wants to get into a defensive mode. What an amazing move from Liger that was! Liger is now fired up. Watch that! But Liger seems to have an advantageous position here. And there you go, a blow with the elbow. Oh no! (Commentary) And a flying punch! Sanju has no answers to Liger's punches. Liger knocks Sanju down with his hard kick Oh my God! Oh my God! It is highly unlikely that Sanju would get up from the floor. Liger is fully pumped! Shit! And this shows how important this match is for him. Superbly fought, Liger the Tiger. The referee presented the National champion trophy to Liger. (Commentary) You really made me proud, my son. You fulfilled your father’s dream. My son is the national champion. What else do I need? Mother. Don’t cry. I must share this news with your father. Where would he be? Would he be there? Balram! Your son became a champion. Our son. Are you listening? It’s our son. Balamani. I, I love you. Do you want betel nut leaf wrap? Yes. I’ll get it. Bro, tw-tw-two Banaras betel nut leaf wraps. Which type do you want? Brother, you are Liger, aren’t you? Champion. Somu? Ramu? Come here. The champion is here. The champion. Brother, I saw your fight. What a fight, brother! No, brother. He just kept hitting hard. Exactly! I was saying the exact same thing. Step aside! Selfie please. Take it. Take a selfie. Brother, what a great job you did! One selfie, please. Sir, please. Hey buddy, congratulations on your success. Thank you. -What’s your next plan? International ch-championship. What? What are you saying? I want to fight in the International ch-ch-championship. Wow! Until now, no one has ever participated from India. Do you think it’s possible? You being an In-Indian, how can you ask another In-Indian if it’s possible? We are Indians. We-we are inferior to none! My-my sister Come with me. Let’s go-go and fi-fight. We, we, We have fire inside us. (Stutter) We are going to set the world on fire. we are going to de-defeat everyone! Inspiring statement by national Liger. His lines have motivated in youth. We are Indians We are no less than anyone! My sister, come with me. Let's go, and fight! we are going to de-defeat everyone! we are going to defeat everyone! We have fire in us Sir, my boy. Top class fighter. I want to send him to International MMA championship. We need your support. Look, it’s highly impossible We can't support him because MMA is not a popular sport in India. Well, if you support it, it will become popular. Only when the government encourages the people will take it seriously. There are no financial returns in MMA. Returns? Sir, what returns should one expect from someone who takes our flag and plants it on the Mt. Everest? Sir, not everything should be measured in terms of finances, sir. Some things must be done to make the country proud. On an international platform, individuals don’t fight. One country fights against another. India beats Pakistan. And my boy here I want him to represent our country. It’s India inside the ring that’s throwing the punches. His punches are going to be for India. Please, try to understand. Please, support me. The Sports Authority of the country denied extending its support to Liger. UFC registrations are going to begin in another two days. I need to enroll him into it urgently. Even if we keep costs to the minimum, it’s going to cost us twenty lakhs. Let’s try in the social media, master. We don’t have that kind of time on us. God has gotten him this far. Why would he let go of my son’s hand in the middle of it? He will do something for sure. Liger. My lovely Liger. A piece of my heart. Do you know where I’ve searched for you? I finally found you after watching you on the television. What? The board rejected you? And you haven’t got any sponsors? I am still alive. Crow. Crow!Crow. If you sent me a message, I would have come to you. Crores and crores I will bring you crores of rupees. Tell me, who amongst you want to go to the US first? I will make you fly first class! first class. You can go and wish Biden and visit statue of liberty We are all in depression here. Just leave. Just because you have a lot of muscle, you think you can just run your mouth? Who I am? Do you know? I am talking nonsense. One second. My brother. Do you want me to dial the number? He is in the US. Does he run a food stall there? He does a lot of business there a lot of business. One second, brother. I am dialing him in. Hi, Stella. I am Ali bhai from Mumbai. Hey, handsome. Howdy? I am good. Where is my brother? Sir is in the conference. Ask him to call back. My brother called me. Hi, brother. How are you? Ali, what’s up? Brother, I told you about a guy who saved my life, didn’t I? He is right here. Here, I’ll show him to you. Look at him. This is the one. Hello, Liger. It’s Pandey here. Congratulations on winning the national championship. Th-th-thank you. -I’ll tell him. He is thanking you. Brother, our boy here must win the international cup. Please book first class tickets for all these people here. First class? Are you insulting me? I will send you my private jet. Instead of telling me this, tell it to these people here. Tell them. Liger, we have a inside man in the embassy. He will grant you visa in a day. After you get your visa, the flight is going to be ready in an hour. Get in. Wheels up and we’ll see you in Las Vegas Las Vegas king. My-my mother. Lady, please don’t worry. I will take care of everything. Sir, thank you very much. You helped my boy at the right time. We are all!we are all very grateful to you, sir. Thank you, sir. -Thank you. Oh, come on. It’s nothing. Just come straight to Las Vegas. Welcome to Las Vegas, Liger. Namaste, sir. -How was the journey? No, no. I am very proud of you. For the first time, a young Indian man got qualified to participate in the MMA. Proud of you. All your support, brother. Thank you. -Don’t mention it, brother Ali. From today onwards, my company is going to sponsor Liger in the tournament. But I need a favor from you. Tell me, sir. Our Indian flag should fly here. Do you have that guts in you? If you have it in you, show the world what India means. What a moment it is in the history of MMA as 26 year old Darren Bill comes to the center stage with the crowd right behind him. And his opponent for tonight is a boy from the streets of India who stands 6ft tall, Liger. The Indian monster Liger. The crowd is going berserk seeing him. This is fantastic. The response is amazing. He has wrapped the Indian flag around himself. Liger. Darren Bill is already waiting for him as Liger gets ready to enter the ring. You can feel the excitement in the building. Liger is looking hungry for the win as he responds to the fans. Liger finally enters the ring and points towards heaven. Liger! Liger! Liger! Darren is already pumped up and is ready to give a good fight. Round one begins and the fight is underway with these two great fighters facing off against each other. And Liger goes down. Buddy gets up. Come on. Hit him just like that. Oh, that's gonna hurt. Liger counters with a kick of his own but Darren grabs his ankle. And here comes the Liger king. Hit him! Come on, block him. He's punching left and right because tries to motivate Ligers Come on. Darren is completely on top of him. Darren pulls him into a rear naked joke. It looks like this could be end -Come on, defend. And the bell rings at the end of round one. Saved by the bell. What a great fight on this first round. A brilliant fight by these two fighters He trying to divert you, Keep your calm and keep moving Do you understand? No, get down. And we're ready for round two. Here we go folks. Oh! Well done! Oh, and Liger control and throws Darren to the floor. Liger jumps on top of him and starts raining punches down. Liger s just taunting this guy and Darren is really pissed. And he gives him a kick. Liger is defending from the ground. Amazing! And Liger grabs his leg and takes him down. He gets him in the leg lock. What a fantastic mood that was. And the crowd is sitting in stunned silence 2nd round comes to an end I'll kill you. Liger! Stop! He is trying to provoke you. He is provoking you. And round 3 began Liger starts on a positive note. Hey! You, -What's going on here? And he falls on the ground Liger! Get up, jerk! But wait, Garry Here's a twist as Liger is slowly getting up to his feet. Darren has his fists raised in victory but Liger is up on his feet and ready to fight again. Yes, Liger. Hit him, Liger! -Hit him! Liger starts attacking with full energy. Hit him! Yes, hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Yes, hit him! Punch after punch and a big kick. And Darren falls to the ground Hit him! Hit him! The match is over Liger! Liger! Liger! Why did you have to work so hard to hit that fellow? Liger! Son, if you face someone who is stronger than you, just remember this one thing. Just imagine that the one in front of you is the person who killed your father! You must get yourself worked up. Your blood should boil with anger. You must strike him down! Yes! Yes! Liger! I like the id-idea. I will follow it. Just stop it, man. -No, Liger. And the fall from Russia looks to take on the pride of Indian Liger in today's MMA match. Ever since I was in my shorts, I was a very good fighter. I am always a topper at breaking bones I don’t care who you are. That is why everyone calls me Liger. All the nerves in my body have turned into steel pins. My eyes blaze with the embers of a roaring fire. My blood keeps boiling like tar. Can you find someone like me ever? Liger! Attack! To Liger all of his opponents are the same, and he's simply beating them all to the ground. I am a total cross breed; my punches are all at high-speed. No one can cross me. I will search for them, find them and subdue them. If you want to stay on this earth, don’t cross me. If you hurt my heart, I will thrash you, thrash you. I am a total cross breed; my punches are all at high-speed. No one can cross me. I will search for them, find them and subdue them. If you want to stay on this earth, don’t cross me. If you hurt my heart, I will thrash you!thrash you. If you threaten me or manipulate me, you will be in danger. If I step into the ring, I am going to break everything. I will lift it up and show you my middle finger. I have courage and I am brave. I am Liger. I will hit you like a bull dozer and you will end up in a garage like a useless car. You will be damaged like a road-roller rolled up on you. I don’t know how my punches feel. The one who is on the receiving end will tell you if they are alive. Liger! Attack! As he takes a walk of fame holding his national flag. Balamani,I-I love you. Liger? Do you want to say anything? Please say it. We are Indians. We will rule the world. Hi everyone. We need to celebrate this day. Until now, we have had doctors, lawyers, engineers, professors, teachers and scientists coming from India. But today, for the first time, a Man is here. And our nation is proud of him. Because he has entered the finals of International MMA. So, cheers! -Cheers! And here we go. Oh, come on. We are celebrating your success here. Let’s have a sip. Liger, you know Sanju, right? You defeated him in the nationals. He is my son. I thought he would win the championship and come here. But you are here. It’s okay. Now I want to introduce my daughter. Tanya. She is into modelling. She wants to become a star like you. Why don’t you give her a few tips? Any tips? Can I ask you a question? What’s the secret of your success? ‘A-A devil.’ Why is that so? What did she do? She ju-jumped over the wall and came to me. Despite my mother being around, she held my hand and pulled me towards her. L-L- This is a joke, brother. She said that she loves me,me. I believe it. I lo-loved her back. And that’s it, she ruined it for me. She let me drown and walked away. She ruined me. She is a very big drama queen, sir. We turn into fools and trust them. They just stab our back and walk away. She set me on fire. But that fire really helped me, sir. No matter who I fought, I pictured her in front and hit hard. That is my secret! Super! Super! Have it. Have it. I will have my time to shine. You thought I was some useless jerk? You thought I will end up alone all my life worshipping you? Sir, we need women like that in our lives. We should get disturbed by them. That is when we would drive ourselves to achieve something with our lives. Hats off to all-all- ‘the devils’ in the world. Cheers! -Cheers! Father asked me to drop you. Shut up and sit. This is my car. The place you stay at, that is mine as well You flew and came here on a plane, right? That is mine as well. So, stop overdoing it. You guys. When in love, you call us angels. When its break up, we are the devils. All over India, you end up ruining my name. Why do you guys turn yourself into Arjun Reddys? Yeah, you guys can’t take a no from a girl. You just live in your male ego. More ego, more beard. More of the beard and you end up drinking a lot as well. You guys just don’t have the guts to move on. When we move on, you’ll be like, “Bro, how did the ‘devil’ move on?” And you end up looking like some lovelorn alcoholic man. Just for sympathy. For sympathy. It’s because if you find yourself another, you can get her shoulder to cry on. How silly. And you call us drama queens. We are not drama queens. You guys are the kings of tragedy. And you know what? The fact is, Girls are made in heaven. And you guys cannot live without girls. Tomorrow, you have a match with an opponent from the USA. If you keep drinking like this, you will lose the match. Actually want to see your defeat I have a charm. I’ll bewitch you. It’s a dough doll in your image. If I light this up here, you will burn yourself in the ring. If I twist your hand here, your actual hand is going to be broken as well. I am your ‘devil’. I am the ‘devil’ in Las Vegas. Liger. Liger. Let's move, Shut your mouth! Thus some people kidnapped ‘the devil’. You know the rest of the story after that happened. Until we got a call, we did not know who those kidnappers were. Liger please help me We want the money right now We don't give you much time If anything goes wrong you will never see Tanya again To night, De La Putas, 4th Avenue. De La Putas, 4th Avenue. Why are you tensed, brother? Is he demanding a ransom? I took a loan from them to buy a 5-star hotel. Everything went topsy-turvy because of the pandemic. They are pressuring me to pay them off urgently. That’s why they kidnapped Tanya. Why don’t you lodge a complaint with the police? I took a loan out from those affiliated with the mafia. Big mistake. If anything goes wrong, he will kill her. Do you have the money or not? I do. My company is a private limited company. I took the loan out in a check. But they are asking all the money in cash. Where would I get it from? I understood his helpless situation. I knew that the situation was dire. So, I took a fake suitcase and went to that address. Let's see what happens Where is the money? Tanya where? Let me check the money. Fi-first, I see Tanya. After money. Hey! What? I am a fighter. You bloody It's empty. Do you think you can cheat us? I, I tried. So-So-So Girls! Kiss - okay. good. Fight no good. Did you get the money? No. Hey, you You should be like a girl. If you behave this way, you will never get married. Idiotic girl! Did I have my way with you, get you pregnant and abandoned you? Why are you to-to-torturing I never thought that I would just end up silenced and hanging there. She came to see me in the finals. But she couldn’t take it when she saw me at the hospital. Sir, please give me some time to arrange the money. Please, leave my daughter. Sir, send her home. Sir, I beg you. I beg you. Please, listen to me. You went and made the situation worse by picking a fight with them. Why? He cannot just let a girl be in a situation like that, sir. He tried something, sir. What if they harm my daughter? I shouldn’t have gotten Tanya to the US. You are responsible for this entire mess. Me? I know everything. I knew that you were in love with each other and broke up. She likes you a lot. Before she told you about her feelings for you, she told me first. You thought she abandoned you? She deliberately distanced herself from you. For you. And for your mother. We left everything behind and came to this place to see him as a champion. We are living to fulfil that dream. Are you going to ruin his life with your idiotic brain? She understood how inconvenienced your mother was because of her. She found that you were distracted because of her. And that is the reason why she deliberately broke up with you. She insulted you, provoked you and left you. Why do you think that is? It’s to make sure that you stick the correct path for you. Instead of her brother, she wished for your success. She prayed for your win in every match. What else can I tell you about her? Father, do whatever is necessary to bring Liger to the international ring. I want to see him win. Please, father. Where are you going? To meet Tanya. I told you not to go. We will be dragged into a another mess. He won’t listen. -The finals are going to be held this evening. He won’t listen to you. You’ve worked really hard and come this far. If he comes, he will come with your daughter. Please, try to come by this evening. If he can make it, he will. If not, that’s the end of it. Where is Ta-Tanya? Sandy Valley Ranch I went to Sandy Valley Ranch to search Tanya I thought I'll thrash that villain the moment he comes across me. But as soon as I saw that Underworld Don, I was astounded Liger! Liger? Stop! I’m a-a fighter! Hey! If you’re a fighter? What am I? Ma, Ma, Mark Anderson. Boss. Yes, I am the boss. Sir,sir,. it’s you? I feel like I am meeting God. I gr-grew up watching you. There is a bi-big photo of you in our house. When I get up in the morning, I pay respects to your photo. I don’t understand even a single word in your language. But, I watch all your interviews. I know all about where you were born and raised and all your antics. You drink bou-bourbon whisky, don’t you? You smoke cu-cuban cigar. You relish ice cream like a little ki-kid, don’t you? I never thought I would ever meet you in my life. What a shock this is for me. What the hell is he saying? He is saying that he is your biggest fan. And that you are like his God. He really loves you, sir. You love me, man? You cry for me? Man. Whatcha want? Anything? I want my girl. Who? Her? Okay. Pay the debt and take her. He is saying that you can take me after you pay them. This entire mess is because we don’t have the money. Boss. No money. No money, no honey. You gotta get out of here man. Come on. What do you think this is? How can I leave without taking the girl? I came here to take her. I will leave only with her. I don’t think it’s going to work here. Why are you talking like a villain, brother? I like that girl. What is he saying? He says that I am his soulmate. And I am his angel. And that he will do anything for me. He’ll die for me. Brother, if you say no, I will even fight you to take her with me. He says if you don’t agree, he is going to fight with you, right here, right now. He is going to screw you. He’s going to punch you. He is going to bash you up. And, he’s going to knock you right here, right now. Hey, I didn’t say all that. Shut up. I already told him. How does it matter? Show the finger. Show the finger.
