Chemical bath I presume? Right. Sorry. That smell. Is that the chemicals? -Perhaps. -You don't know? -This line of work has its consequences. Losing one's sense of smell is one of them. -Magical. The science of photography and the study of spirit are two sides of a coin. Don't you think? They both look beyond the surface to reveal the truth unseen. -Truth? I hate to inform you, dear Doctor. Truth and photography have a tenuous relationship at best. -Is revealing truth not the goal of every photographer? Here. For example... A lovely young woman in a pretty hat.
