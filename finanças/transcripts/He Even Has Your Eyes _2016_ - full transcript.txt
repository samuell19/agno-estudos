These people have been waiting for four years... They're ready now. A couple is a couple. Let's not differentiate them. Sorry I'm late. Can I speak? I'm just giving you my opinion. It's going to bring attention to us. Let me remind you that our administration's first mission is to protect... The child's interests. Exactly! Not to experiment with things. Experiment with what? We know our mission. Can you explain what "experiment" means to you? It means it's the first time we try something. It's an English word. -Claire is right. -Thank you, Caro. Thank you. -Quiet! -I'm sorry. Quiet! What's all this racket? It's them... -Are you done, Claire? -Yes. Good. We are all aware here that we're working for the children's well-being. I will present the Alloca case to the next family council. Thanks, everyone. We should have started there. Thank you, Charles. The family council will decide. Yes, I know. If they agree, I'm asking you to make your visits quietly. Like for any family. Of course, who do you take me for? I'm sure everything will go well. Just married! How are you? Hi! Congratulations! A little bit. Here. Hop, hop, hop! It's enough. -You okay? -It's just for a toast. We need to respect the local customs. I would prefer celebrating the birth of a grand-son, rather than a shop. Mom! -You like it? -Great. I haven't forgiven you yet. There we go again... It's been six months that I've had to have lunch alone. Find a lawyer, that will keep you busy. I thought flowers would make you nicer. -I'm nice. -How are you? Put everything there. One, two, three! One, two, three! HE EVEN HAS YOUR EYES Don't fall back asleep. Come on! I don't understand, I just drank... -three glasses. -Three? Maybe five. I can't remember. You're getting old, you can't take it anymore. Whatever! Leave that, you're late, I'll take care of it. I'll finish cleaning. Will you meet me? Don't forget that guy's coming for the lock. I can do it. It's gonna cost a lot. In two years? Yeah. Okay. Okay? -I love you. -I love you too, boo. Stop it! Don't call me "boo." See you later! Hello? Yes. Hello. Oh! You scared me, boo. Are you okay? What's wrong? I got a call. It was them. "Them," who? Them. It was them? You're perfect. Mr. and Mrs. Alloca. Mr. Vidal will see you. This way, please. Well... Everything will be fine. The family council has offered to entrust you with a little boy. So that you can adopt him. Born four months ago of unidentified parents. He had an hepatitis at birth. Don't worry, today, he's perfectly healthy. His name is Benjamin. Benjamin. Sorry I'm late. Claire. -Sir. -This is Claire Mallet who's in charge of Benjamin's case. Right. Until the final adoption ruling is pronounced. Did I miss anything? No. I was presenting Benjamin. Please, go on. Well... It is time to tell you we're facing a quite particular case. It's the first time it's happened. You remember... on the agreement forms you expressed a few wishes. About the child's origin, the gender... Et cetera, et cetera. You were quite open. -Yes. -Yes. We took this into account. Did you change your mind? You could. You have the right to. If you had any hesitation, you should say so. We can love all the children in the world but not be anyone's parents. Yes, we would let you know. Good. Very well. In this case... Let me introduce you to Benjamin. Please take your time to think it over. -But... -But? It's a boy? Yes, Benjamin. Yes. Benjamin, it's a boy's name. He's so handsome! Thank you so much. It's crazy, right? Are you sure you're okay with it? What does the baby need? A daddy and a mommy. Yes, but... In this case... Here, look... He even has your eyes. No? Benjamin Alloca. He could be a conductor. That's for old people. -Football player's good. -Not a football player. They always get injured. I would get worried. Of course not. -He could be a journalist. -A journalist? Yes. They can change the world. We can change the world. The first Benetton family. That's us. We're the "I have a dream." After the renovation work, we'll have a party. -It's not a given. -Surgeon. Surgeon's great. Dr. Benjamin Alloca to the operating room. Dr. Alloca! He'll save lives. He'll travel, he'll have seminars about love. -He'll cite us as his models. -You could start by finishing his room. Yeah, you're right. We can't have a future professor here. Hop! Come on, let's work! I'll make a palace for that boy. -Really? -Yeah, a palace. Sali, you don't want to help me? I love you! Benjamin... Welcome. Hello, you. Hello... Benjamin... Oh, yes... It's time to hold him in your arms. Right, Benjamin? Yes, you feel like it. You see? All right. Come here. Hello... Come on. Benjamin is healthy. It's just difficult to bottle-feed him. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to let us know. We're here for that. Kids are cruel at school. Imagine, the little white guy says, "My parents are here." Everyone looks, it's a couple of Blackies. Of black people. Same thing. Then why are you saying it? You say "white people," not "whities." Stop, you're getting on my nerves. You used to say "Blacks" before. Never. Or maybe in a certain context. -You're not being honest. -No, I'm not like that. It gets on my nerves. You're the one who... It's you, Claire. You know it. What? White people adopt black children. There's no problem. Oh, Baptiste! But people are used to it. Precisely! It's time mentalities changed. You know what I work on at the ASE? We find appropriate foster families for children. We don't change mentalities. What is this? Others do it for you. Otherwise I'd have a servant. You wouldn't have the right to vote. You couldn't sign checks. -You're going to make a list? -If you want. Why am I speaking with you? Because I'm white. -Oh... Stop it. -I'm white. There's six months left before the adoption. Believe me, this case... I'll follow it very closely. Well, good night. -Claire? -Yes? I was reading. Open-plan kitchen. This is not a bearing wall. What do I do? A huge hole! And we put-- -But, boo... -It's perfect, don't change anything! Atata! Benjamin! Thank you, madam. My parents? I didn't tell them yet. We'll see him every day. It's the period of adaptation. Come on, let's go. And a little bib. Yeah, I'm the daddy. It's nice. Good bye, singers! Good bye! Bye! -There it is. -Yeah... It's a souvenir of the first few weeks he spent with us. All right It's important he keeps memories of the time he spent here. -For when you're older. -Yes. Yeah. You'll finish all your bottles at home. Right? -Will you come to see us? -We promise. We promise. -Shall we go? -Yes. Go. Let me give you a kiss. Say, "Bye." He smiled a little bit. Yes. It's the big day? Yes. That's it. Benjamin. That's nice. -Yes. -That's nice... As we told you before, I'll come visit you at home to see if everything is going well. Would next week be okay? Tuesday is good for me. -Is it good? -Yes, very good. Then, it's good. Good bye, Benjamin. See you on Tuesday. Say good bye. He's a bit tired. Okay. Good bye, Mrs... Alloca. Good bye. Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh! It's... nice. -Thank you. -All right. -What did I do wrong? -Nothing. Slowly... How are you, my son? He seems to like his new home. It's nice. He hasn't seen the renovation. -I can tell you... -Don't play smart. We need to pick up the pace. We can't have the social worker in here. -Don't worry. -That would look bad. You didn't think she was weird? No, why? No, that's nothing. I spoke to my mom on the phone. I told her we would come on Saturday. Great. But did you tell them? Not yet. I'd rather tell them face to face. Yes, you're right. Face to face is better. Should I have said it on the phone? I don't know. You think it would have been better? I don't know, I'm asking you. I don't know. What are they doing? She said at 12, it's 12:10. Ousmane, is it enough food? We always think we make enough. I should have made some maf√©. My grandson! Hi, Mom. Hi. We were getting worried. -Where is my grandson? -With the car. Paul is parking the car. -Is Dad here? -Why didn't you take him with you? Hi, Dad. Why didn't you take him with you? -Hello. -Where is he, Sali? They're coming. They're downstairs. They're coming up So... Well. I need to tell you something. It's about the... The baby. They gave you a sick one? -No. -See, I was right. No, the baby's fine. Then what? Is he Congolese? -No. -I said no Congolese. There's always a problem with them. -He's not Congolese. -Honey, tell me Lamine is not Congolese. Lamine? That's his name. -His name is Benjamin! -No. You're going to change that. He can't be called Benjamin. -I'm not changing... -It's Lamine. Like Ousmane's father, Ousmane's grand-father, and Ousmane's great-grand-father. It's the tradition. The tradition. Then how come Dad's name is not Lamine? They made a mistake. The immigration services, on the passport. You're bothering me. Tradition is tradition. That's it. You're going to call him Lamine. -Or Ousmane. -At least, not Benyamin. Benjamin, not Benyamin. Benjamin. Benjamin. Isn't that Jewish? Dad, Mom, listen to me. Well. Benjam-- My grandson. That's him. My grandson. Mom. Mom! Hello. What is that? I think we came a little too early. It's Benjamin, Mom. He's my... -Yes. -He's my... Ousmane! Ousmane! -Mom! -Ousmane! Here we go. Are you sure they didn't make a mistake? Yes, we're sure. It's possible they made a mistake with the baby, with all these computers... It's an adoption, Mom. They offered, we agreed. Because you did agree? Well, yes. Yes... In this case, we can't call him Lamine. -Or Ousmane. -No, no. -You want to hold him? -What? In your arms? I'll see if they need me in the kitchen. Well, if I need me... I should have made some white meat! Here. Come here, baby. Sali. It went fine, huh? They need time. Frankly, it could have been worse. You'll see, soon they'll beg us to take him to see his cousins. In Senegal. Benyamin! Benyamin, where does that come from, Ousmane? How could she do this? I would have preferred a Congolese! What are we going to do, Ousmane? It's a mess! Hello! Did you know? -You saw the baby. -Why didn't you say anything? I don't see the problem. -You don't see a problem? -No. Ousmane! She doesn't see a problem. Anyway, this child will never be my grandson. Fran√ßois Hollande. What did he say? Because of a strike, we're unable to broadcast the usual programs. We are sorry for this inconvenience. Come on. You're not hungry anymore? Good, you ate well this morning. Very, very well. I'm proud of you, my love. You will do a nice burp for your mommy. Oh, that was a nice one. Yes! What else? Yes, hello? Hello, this is Mrs. Mallet, from the ASE. Yes, hello. Is Benjamin all right? Yes, he's doing great. Good. I wanted to tell you I have a conflict for tomorrow evening. Is it okay if I come tonight instead? 6:30, is it okay with you? Yes, all right. All right. Good. Thank you. Sorry about that. See you tonight. See you tonight. -Don't let me down. -Don't worry, I'll keep them for you. You have time, Valentine's Day is in two months. -Can I come and get them the day before? -Whenever you want. Well, you look exhausted for a guy who just opened. -No, it's because... -What? -I'm a dad. -You don't say? Congratulations, buddy! -Welcome to the club. -Thanks. Hey, did you watch it? -Well, no. -You did well. When you see that thing open, with the slimy-- After that, zero libido! Put it on the side. You'll use it later. I have two teenagers, so... -Here. A gift for the first one. -That's nice. I won't sell them. Hey! Give a kiss to your blue-eyed boy. -What? -Give a kiss to your blue-eyed boy. Yeah. You got it? Yeah. But you know, it's exactly that. -Really? -Yeah. -Bye! -What? I sure will. What a jerk... He made me believe... A gift? -A surprise! -Oh! -I love it! -I'm happy. It's a fair trade and hypoallergenic product. See, he's wearing it! You're so handsome. Here, girls. Some macaroons. It's on me. He's so cute! What's his name? -Benjamin. -Benjamin. Oh, well. He looks just like you. Thanks. He's cute, right? Yes. You're always in demand. By the way, I didn't tell you I spoke to them. -To whom? -My friends who adopted an Ethiopian. -Yes. -You need to meet them. I swear. I don't like that... Adopters Anonymous, sharing our experiences. They'll give you some advice. I don't feel like it, Prune. Oh! I need to change him. -I'm going. -Can I? Please. So you can rest. Trust me! I need to practice. Next time, maybe it will be me. We never know. I'm happy! Come here, baby... Be careful. Come with Auntie Prune. Aren't you forgetting the diaper? Oh, yes... There. It will be fine, baby. -Where is the bathroom? -Over there. What about the parents? They're doing fine. I bet they're still talking about Benjamin. A little bit. You know Mom. It's the commedia dell'arte. But it was the same for Paul. And it got better. What about Dad? Dad... "You see, when we arrived in France, it was to work. Not to adopt little white boys. What is this?" Auntie Prune, she's going to change you somewhere. A changing table, see? We should remove this first. Otherwise, we can't put on the diaper. Oh, it stinks! What did they feed you? How do you remove this nasty thing? Shit, it's nasty! There... A diaper... You see, it's nice! We did it. It's nice. He's peeing on me! Damn it! Don't do this again! All right! Don't you have any kids? It's crazy. Really, people-- They don't know what it's like! Really, I tell you... No, let me go. I can't deal with this. Damn, I can't deal with this. Look how she dressed him! -Are you serious? -It's a job. I'm not ready for that. -This should go underneath. -It looks nice. Is everything ready? Perfect. Yes. Paul. About my parents, let's tell them it's okay. -The ASE says sometimes... -Please. Okay, all right. Sali. Relax. It's not an exam. Come on, come on! Come on buddy, it will be fine. Yes, madam! I'm here! -Hello. -Good evening. Please, come in. This way. Be careful. It's upstairs. -Be careful. -It's a nice mess. I got delayed. I can see that. Hello, Mrs. Mallet. Hello... Your shoes. Any progress with the feeding? Yes, really, he eats well. What about the daycare? I called, we should have a spot in September. Good. And in the meantime? I'll keep him with me. All right. It's not a problem with the store? No. When I have a busy day, I call someone. And with the family, we always have a solution. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried, M. Alloca. -What about the five months visit? -It's like a car, really. Paul. I don't understand. You have to do a smog check at a certain point, 5 months, 6 months... It was a joke. No, the pediatrician's visit? We have an appointment early next week. Good. -What about the relatives? The family? -Great. Really? Obviously, they were a bit surprised at the beginning. No wonder. Who wouldn't be? According to our studies, for mixed adoptions, there can be acceptance issues coming from the families. But for you... No. Well, no. No. Well, that's good. You're an exception, then. You have understanding parents, Mrs. Alloca. They're very understanding. What about you, Paul? I saw you had lost your parents. The question doesn't apply there. No. It doesn't apply. Well, thank you. Good bye, Benjamin. Say good bye. Let's meet next week. Comparing Benjamin to a car... Her questions sounded like a mechanical check. I don't trust her anyway. This attitude she has. I don't like it at all. What is this doing in the kitchen? It shouldn't be here. I called Manu. -We'll work faster together. -Manu? He's staying at his mother's. I told him about Benjamin, he went crazy. Well, it's Manu. Don't blame me for not working fast enough. Okay. But you handle it. Yes. -Come on, baby. -I didn't feed him today. Okay. Mom! My girl. Here, it's a blessing you're here. I would never have made it without you. Here. -Where are you going? -To the mosque. You're going to the mosque now? I saw Dr. Kimba. He said to bring white food so the baby can find his family. What kind of bullshit is this? Bullshit? You're talking to me? You think if you put all this food in front of the mosque, those who abandoned the child will wake up and come and get him? -Might as well pray for him to be black. -Do not disrespect me. I'm trying to do something for my grandson. -Is he your grandson or not? -Enough! You know what I mean. I'm trying to solve this issue. What are you doing? You think this situation is normal? It's bullshit. My Manu's here! -Dad! -Yeah! I'm a dad! Look at me. Are you okay? -Yes. -Come on in. Where's the mother? She's here. With the baby. She's putting on the coating. You're beautiful. You're beautiful! You're more beautiful as a mother. She's always been the most beautiful. Yeah. Let me introduce you to the cutest one, Benjamin. This is... You did great. -We did what we could. -No, wait! You did amazing! I'm Uncle Manu! I brought you something from Bamako. Easy. Oh, you smell good! It's fine. Let's do the plane! Don't worry. Uncle Manu is the pilot! Oh! You've got Sophie the giraffe! You're so lucky! You're gonna have fun with Sophie. I would have loved to have her too. Don't you worry about anything. We're all adopted. Anyway. All right, Manu! Manu, weren't you supposed to help Paul? I'm sorry, but... We have to go. Come here, baby. There. His giraffe. Your Sophie. Coffee, Manu? Yeah, I'd like a beer. Have a good day, work well. Yeah, bye. Have a good day. Thank you. Good bye. Good bye. -So... Benjamin. -Yes, that's us. -Hello. He's the little new one! -Yes. -He's cute. -Yes. The mother couldn't make it? It's an adoption. Yes, but the mother? I'm the mother. Right! Okay. Actually, I thought that you... All right. Okay, it's clear now. You are the mother. Right. Yes, it's clear now. I don't know what's wrong, I'm sorry. Because he's very cute. And you too. Shall we? Right. Please. At the end of the corridor, on your right. Who's next? Us. Great. Great. You never thought about having kids, a family? You are my family. No, your own kids. Yes, of course. When I'm older. But you need to explain something to me. What did they smoke at Social Services? Very funny. It's not Social Services. It's the ASE. The tradition is to give a black baby to white people. It's nice, it's like Christmas for the baby. I'm just wondering how we got to that point. -What? -I have a simple theory. It's called evolution. -Evolution? -Evolution, buddy. Before, it was daddy, mummy. Today, daddy, daddy. Mummy, mummy. Well, yes. -What are you saying? -Take a blended family. The kids go to dad's, to mom's... You're looking for your bedroom. Think about the kids with their tablets. The Internet is fast. Super fast. That's why we end up giving white babies to black people. Because of the tablets? No, it's evolution! Damn! You're not listening to me. No, I'm not listening anymore. You should listen to me, otherwise... You're not going to understand anything! Hello, sister. How are you? -Hello. -The sun feels really nice. This one is so cute! Hello, you! You only have one? -Well, yes. -I can find you 2 or 3 more. But don't forget my commission. Oh, you're a newbie! I'll give you my card. Call me whenever you want. You and me, we can do business together! Oh... He's handsome. What's his name? Benjamin. And I'm not his nanny. I'm not a nanny either. I'm a "nursery assistant." Well, I'm his mother. His mother! That's a good one. Really, his mother! Did she think I was the police? Girls, you know what she told me? Boo... He's starting to like his bedroom. Good news for us! Today someone thought I was his nanny. -What? -Twice. They thought I was his nanny. Well... What did you think? That they would take you for Snow White? Of course they think you're the nanny. And I'm the security guard at the store. Your father is a janitor, your mother is a housemaid. And your sister, you know what? She sells crack in front of her high school. -Yeah, sista! -You're stupid. Can I go back? Thanks, boo. Don't call me boo! Stop it! -I scared you. -A little bit. That wasn't my intention. No, I was daydreaming. When I'm closing up, I... Don't we have an appointment tomorrow? Yes, but... I have a conflict. Didn't you get my message? Well, no. Oh, boy. If it's a problem... No, it's okay... Okay. There. Well, it's that way. Good. Flowers are nice. Shit, what a pain... She gives me shitty cases, I can't take it. This company is a mess. What about you? Tell me about your life as a mom. It's fine. You sound sad. I hope it's not the baby blues. No, it's for mothers who actually gave birth. So what? If you want to have the baby blues... What would be nice, would be a weekend in Normandy. The baby would see the sea. It's complicated, right now. It's complicated when you say it's complicated. Prune, I'm telling you it's complicated. Is that complicated? I need to go. I'll call you back. She's getting on my nerves! Boo? We have a guest. It's me! Good evening. Good evening. There you go. -He's cute. -Yes, it's... He's an angel. Great. What about your parents? Great. Still great. I can't wait to meet them. It would be complicated to meet them, actually... Really? Why? They're in Senegal. That's right? Yes. The funeral, yes... It's a big, big funeral. Yes, over there, the conditions are tough. Not easy, over there. The diseases, the heat... It's tough. It's a tough country. In one family, you could have a disaster. When it's not war. Yes, a lot of wars. The tribes... And genital mutilation. Right. Genital mutilation. Are they okay? Yes, yes. Great. They won't stay long. Perfect, I'll see them when they're back. Is that... What is it? A worker I hired for the renovation. -Yes. It's-- -He's going to break the house. And wake up the baby. I'm going. Excuse me, Mrs. Mallet. Go. Right. Watch out! Using the hammer. The woman from Social Services is here! Manu, it's not the right time. My life is on the line. It's the ASE, that's all. So sorry. I'm sorry! Not too much noise, upstairs? Baby, quiet? Don't worry about it. I was telling... -Zlatan. -Zlatan. That he could go home. -Right, Zlatan? -Thanks, boss. Right, mul»õumesc, you'll see... Zlatan. You need to go, now. Boss not happy. Upset. Does he get upset often? Nice boss. Okay. Woman boss, very nice. Yes, of course. He's right to ask. You should declare him even without papers. But... We'll be done next week. I can't wait to meet your parents. Of course, as soon as they're back... I promise. I'll walk you back, Mrs. Mallet. Right, walk her back. -Yes. Please declare him. It's the law. -Yes! I'll take care of it. Are you dumb or what? -It's only apple sauce! -What are you talking about? What did you tell Mrs. Mallet? Nothing special, she's nice. She's got a great accent. A little literal. You speak Romanian? -A little bit. -Eat your apple sauce. You messed up, Manu. I swear you messed up. These visits are important. I did it to help you guys. What if she says you work illicitly? We lose everything. The shop, the kid, everything. It's important that you declare me. I can't take it anymore. Why are you getting upset? You have the kid. That's it. It's a transition! They check us for six months. -I didn't know. -You piss me off! I'm sorry... I couldn't know they did temporary contracts with kids. Giving is giving, right? And don't smoke in the house! Can't smoke, can't drink. Go take a shower for once. I guess I'll take a shower. I'm sure they're not telling me everything. You know adopters always hide things for fear of being misjudged. Sometimes they overact. You need to make them comfortable. Are you trying to teach me my job? -Not at all. -They're comfortable with me, but I don't trust them. I need to change my method. Claire, I know you care about this case, but you need to keep the necessary objectivity. I keep it, I keep it. -Come on, let's go back! -Yep. The weather is great. You know how warm it is? Forty-five degrees. You want me to read your horoscope? You're a Gemini, right? Love: you could experience an exquisitely naughty affair. They're so good. -Already at work, Manu? -Yeah. -Did you sleep well? -Yeah, great. You didn't bring the baby down? He's sleeping. -No more coffee. -Then make some! Shit! Wait. Here... We could do something here. What? Did he cry last night? He woke up at 3, 5 and 7 am. Sorry, I didn't hear anything. I noticed that. Sali, I'm exhausted. The shop, the renovation... Right, it's never your fault! Tell him to stop! All right, have a good day. I'll have coffee at the shop. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm tired. It's okay. I need us to be close again. It would be nice to leave for the weekend Yeah. We really need a break. Have a good day too. Sali, you're not kidding, your friend is really single? I'm not a one-night-stand guy. I'm not some weirdo from the Internet. I want a real relationship. Sali! -That's Prune? -Yeah, that's her. Come on, guys! She's excited as a prune. -Hey! -Hey! -How are you? -Great! It's really nice here. Hello. Hi, Prune. -Manu. -Manu, Prune. Prune, Manu. -Here! This is for you. -Thanks! Can you bring me a diaper? Coming! Let's have a bath! No, the pool's not heated. Warrior, baby. No. I can't believe it. Is he going to do it? That's Manu, he's capable of anything. He really did it! Honey, I'd cut everything, A stylish mini-skirt. Is she serious? You don't know the American style? You don't know Beyonc√©, Nicki Minaj, Rihanna? They look like that. Yes! Look. Quit that, with your old village cloth. What's that? By the way, you still have problems with your daughter? Tell me about it. Even with Dr. Kimba, it's not working. Forget about Kimba. I have connections in the village. My sister just gave birth to her seventh baby. She's got money problems, but I can give you the baby. That would help. No, my daughter, I don't think she'll agree with that. Even I... Mamita, I'm your friend, I'm here for you. Someone's home. It depends. What is it for? -Hello, first of all. -Hello. Let me introduce myself, I'm Mrs. Mallet. I work for the ASE, the child welfare service. I'm in charge of Benjamin's case. -Mamita! -Mrs. Ciss√©. How are you? Great, and you? So, what? So, could I speak to you for five minutes? Yes... You're the mother of Salimata Alloca? Absolutely, come in. Thanks. First, let me give you my condolences for the tragedy. -What? -Yes, I know. Your daughter told me about the funeral in Africa... The pain, I know about it. Be strong. There are no words. Be strong. It's nice, here. I love it, man. It's a first? -Yep. -Right, daddy? Look at him. What can you do? -You look at him, you melt. -You're okay, Manu? Come on, doggy! Come on! Give him to me. Go and see your buddy. I'm coming! We'll play with the kite. -What are you doing? -Coming, yeah! You're almost... No, stop! I slept so well, it's been so long! You needed it. -What's on the menu, tonight? -You're already hungry? Yes. Do you need help? Yes? Go ahead. Great! Once, in Chile, I made empanadas for 200 people at a funeral. What? It's so good! Have fun. There's sea bass in the fridge. Sea bass, it's the king of fish. He cooks super well, Manu. What kind of spices do you have? Many spices. He cut the fish's head! -They're coming! -Who is it? You'll see. You'll see! Hello! -What? -Why didn't you tell me? What a jerk! If I had told you, you wouldn't have come. Hello! Hello, my Prune! Give me your bags. Where did you put the pajamas? Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Well, hello. If no one makes a joke, there's a problem. Right. So the Social Services really smoke! This is Paul. And Benjamin. And... what do you think? -About what? -About adoption. I think it's great. What I mean is... If you had to have children, would you prefer to have them naturally? What are you talking about? What? The biological clock. Tick-tock, you know. What's that, tick-tock? Well... If you need me, I'm here. If you just want to fuck me, no need to talk about kids. Wait... I know that! I just think it's classier. Good night, my love. Good night. What language is this? Norwegian. My mom is Norwegian. Right. And where are you from? Cr√©teil. Parisian suburbs. You and me, we know the truth. You've been saying shit for 20 minutes. Why? You're saying we have to have children. He didn't say that! The couple at the supermarket, with the stroller... He didn't say that! We don't have to... It's a Judeo-Christian view. -No need to... -He's not making any sense. Not always. Sometimes. We don't know. What about you? Well, we're fine. It's just my parents. -Two months I haven't heard from them. -Who wants a kid? Nice. Some single people adopt kids. It's not conservative or Judeo-Christian... Manu! You're so loud. -Kids can sleep through the noise! -You're ready to have kids. Did he make dessert? Don't you smell the chocolate? Ready in two minutes! Shit! How did it go with the ASE? Okay. I'm not saying we were not nervous about the meetings. -I was a wreck! -Exactly. Of course. You feel like you have to pass an exam. Yes. Except that your kid is at stake. It's not that bad. It's rare when they withdraw a kid. Our social worker makes me uncomfortable. It's always a challenge. Once a week. -Once a week? -Yes! Was it like that for us? Never. It was 2 or 3 times, over 6 months. You see, Paul! There's an issue. You shouldn't let them do that. -There's no reason... -Here's the dessert. Handmade. Homemade. Beautiful. Yes. Actually... -You want some? -No. -Yes! -Why? Oh... -Prune, Prune! -I'm not hungry. -Come on! -No, I'm not hungry. Why not? -I did it for you. -Smell it! You're playing with the food, that sucks! That really sucks! -Manu! -I'll go and smoke a joint! Manu, Manu! Manu, Manu! Come on! Come on, let's go! Paul! You need to give the child back! I tried to call you all weekend. The administration lady came. It's a disaster! What lady? The lady with a funny name. Mallette! Mallet? Yes. You lied to her. We never went to Senegal. And what about the genital mutilation story? -Ousmane is beside himself. -What did you say exactly? I don't want you to go to jail. Or my daughter! I understand you want a child. It makes sense. I have a solution. She'll tell you. His name is Bissam, he's 4 months old. He's really strong. He's a king. He doesn't even cry or poop. Her sister, his mother, is ready to do the kafala. -The what? -Kafala. You're right, these West Indies people are clueless. It's like an adoption, but not really. There's been one in the family. There won't be any more issue. This makes no sense. No sense? Paul, please. My daughter can't go to jail. No one's going to jail. Come with me. Someone doesn't want to see me there. What do I do with the baby? He's on the plane. Nothing. Watch the shop! Sali doesn't want to see me. She doesn't want to see her mother. Mrs. Diakit√© Fashion. She doesn't want to see me. Yes, she does. Come on! I'm not going in. -If she doesn't want to see... -Sali. -We have an issue. -What? -Mallet went to see your mother. -You lied. All right, Mamita. We'll call the ASE. We won't let this go. What happened? You should have listened. You're so stubborn. Do the kafala. Enough with your kafala. Hello? Yes, hi. I'd like to speak to Mr. Vidal. Tell him it's urgent. He needs to call Mr. Alloca. Thanks. He will, right? Thank you. What are we going to do? I don't know. It's not right to lie to the government. You will end up in jail. Period. And you, with us. You're also responsible. -Me? -Yes! And please, this is ridiculous. Are you coming in or not? No one invited me in. Really? You're coming in, you're going to hold your grandson and make peace. Come on. Mamita. Forget it, Paul. No, no, that's enough. That's her grandson. -What are you doing? -Trust me. Come here. Let's see granny. Your little granny. Look at her. Your beloved granny. Take your grandson. He's not my grandson. Mamita, whether you want it or not, he's part of the family. Come on. There. You're with your granny. -I don't feel anything. -Really? I'm telling you. Wait. No, that's enough. Give him to me. Come to mommy. Are you happy now? It's okay, baby. -Here, eat. -It's okay. Why is he not eating? Did you take his temperature? Maybe his teeth? He has a poop in his diaper. -What? -Smell. He has a poop. I don't smell anything. Yes, it smells like poop. I'd like to see you eating while sitting on a poop. -Wait. Where are the diapers? -In the bag. Where is it? -I don't know. -Where do you change him? In the room upstairs. Come here, baby. I'll take care of your white butt. With them, you won't make it. I don't know what to do with Mrs. Mallet. Salimata, a diaper! There we go. Have you lost your mind? You see them every week? You saw their grandparents? I told you to keep your distance. They lied about the grandparents' reaction. That doesn't explain your methods! Then what? Ask the neighbors? Have the police interrogate them? Anyway, it's my fault. I should have known you'd get carried away. You were against it. -I didn't get carried away. -What do you call it? Charles, they lied, you hear me? You're going to hear me! Why are we doing this? Did you forget? It's about love, about humanity. So that a family can be created. I warned you, but it wasn't enough. I'm withdrawing you from the Alloca case. Honey, will you lay the table, please? -Where were you? -Grocery shopping. Don't lie to me. I heard you had something to do. And I'm hungry. Don't play the African. Not with me. Careful, Mamita! Respect! You want respect? If you continue like this, I'll play the modern housewife. -What? -I'll file for divorce. Divorce? -Are you sure she won't come anymore? -Sure. I liked Mrs. Mallet. You want her number? Hello? Yes, boo. Wasn't your mother supposed to come? Yes, but something came up. Anyway, I'll pick him up at 5 pm. With your father, will it be okay? He won't be there all day. Don't worry. I'll handle it! Okay, sending you a kiss. I love you. Bye. Was it Sali? Don't smoke here. Yes, it was Sali. Who would I say "I love you" to? I don't know your whole life. West Indian people... Yes. Some days, I'd like to be a Caribbean guy. In the family, it's not possible. Stop laughing. I'm telling you he's white. White. White? Wala√Ø, brother. Not an albino? Thankfully not. This would bring bad luck. He's blond. Blond like Claude Fran√ßois? Yeah. My friend, your girl and her West Indian have lost it! -I don't know what to do. -We'll help you. Dear friends, listen to me. I've just learned something very serious. Ousmane has told me... that his Salimata and her West Indian just had a white baby! He ate well. Of course, he ate well. What kind of weird baby eats when you sing a song? We'll make a singer out of him. No, singers have issues. It depends. Here, kiss your beloved granny. Cute baby. -He really looks like my family. -He's your son. He's your exact copy. -Your copy! -Your copy! Selfie! Selfie! A picture! Come here. With the cute baby. Put your head inside. Move. -There you go. -Tickle, tickle. Cheese! Look at him! Ousmane! You have to go! Put him on your back. I'm not responsible for the baby. -He's gonna kill me. -You need to hide his head. Go grab the coat, honey. Honey, you're here. Oh, Ousmane! The man's here. Mamita! -Please. -Mamita! Take him to your place a little bit. -I can't. I have my business to do. -Then drop him at Mrs. Ciss√©'s. I'll come when the bananas are down. -What? -When the bananas are down. It's a code. She knows what it means. This little girl's mom, she wanted to install cameras. I said no. What is this? Reality TV? A√Øcha! A√Øcha! Here comes the star. Take him. -You need to watch him for an hour. -I have enough. -It's for Mamita. The bananas are down. -Say what? -The bananas are down. -Okay, then. Come help me, what are you doing? Well, just... You, what's up? Mrs. Intellectual, she's reading. Come here, baby! Watch your phone, she'll call you. -All right. -And you, we can't see you. Make up, perfume, jewels. Don't forget the creams! Today, you're elegance itself. -Elegance? -Yes. Is that elegance? -She's beautiful. -That's nice. How long have we known each other? It's been... thirty-five years. In 8th grade, right? No! In 5th grade. I was 9. You remember so many things! Say captain, say what You say what! You remember? Say captain, say what Say captain, say what Say captain, say what Say captain, say what Do you want to be Benjamin's godfather? Is that a joke? Not a good one. No, it's not a joke. Shit... You can't say it like that! Well, yeah! -My mom's gonna be so happy. -Well, yeah! Godfather! Damn! -Shit, fuck! -Manu! Careful! I don't know. Look, zucchini. -Watch the babies. -I will. Oh, what is it? Your nose is running? Ladies, hello. Hello. -Hello. -Are all these babies yours? Of course. I worked hard, right? Especially for the red-haired one. Look at him! We came across a funny one! -You think it's funny? -No. My colleague doesn't think it's funny. Me neither. You have your papers? Excuse me? You have your papers, please? Why would I show them to you? -Please, show us your papers. -You really think it's the right time? Madam, please. Please. I won't repeat myself. Show us your papers. You too, madam. -But wait. -You have your papers? -Why...? -Do you speak French? -Show us your ID, please. -Why are you asking her? Sorry, madam, I'm closing... Paul! I tried to call you so many times! The police called. -Benjamin is at the police station. -What? -Already? -At the police station? Why weren't you picking up? I'll come. No, park the car! And unload it! -The police station? -They asked us to come. I'm the godfather. What is this about? His nanny was arrested for not showing her papers. She made a scene and didn't even know his name. When was that? An hour ago. Charles. He's not 1 yet, and already at the police station. I can't believe it. Maybe Claire was right after all. Send her back to her country? You think she came here to have fun? She'll end up in a detention camp! That's it! You're giving me a headache! Take her down. Don't you touch me! Don't you touch me! Let's start over. This child individual is your grandson, yes or no? He's my grandson, sir. Why did you say the opposite? I said my daughter was adopting him. Are you pretending you don't understand? Who's the lady who watches the children? No one, that's her daughter. The guy is clueless, or what? My colleague asked me to take your deposition for undeclared child care by an illegal alien. Illegal alien? -No. -Undeclared? Just because we're black. It's always the same. Berthier. The parents. Salimata! We'll talk about this later. We're the adoptive parents of Benjamin Alloca. Where is he? A social worker came to pick him up. She's with the ASE. With the ASE? Excuse me, Berthier. Are we talking about the same baby? The one we saw was quite Caucasian. Coca-what? Listen, it's really unfortunate, but we have decided that Benjamin should remain in the nursery. Until a new family council decides on his fate. You can ask for the right to visit him. I'm sorry. I won't move. Sali, please, Sali... I won't move. I won't move. I waited for this child for so many years. Shaking at each call. Waiting for the mail and you want to take him away? Are you kidding? Do you know what waiting means? Waiting in the dark, without knowing. I sucked it up, I remained quiet. And you want to take him away? Are you kidding? You gave him to me! You gave him to me! Mrs. Mallet! Mrs. Mallet! You can't do this! Please calm down. Don't touch me! Don't touch her! The case is not closed yet. You have no right. He's my son. But he's my son. Stop it. Don't think that I'm happy I was right. I don't think anything. I was just wondering how we got to this point. Your mother's not here? No, she's at Sali's. Again? They took her son away, Dad. It wasn't her son. Dad. Sorry, but what did you think when you came to France? Excuse me? When you came here... and had us, Sali and me, you thought we would be locked in? What are you talking about? I wanted the best for you. Exactly. What are you afraid of? Why does it matter that your daughter adopts a white child? It's not how things work. And leaving your country is? Coming here when you didn't know anyone? Without money or papers? Working every day on the construction sites... so we could go to college. Well, this is not how things work usually. But you can be proud of it. Now, if the world changes... you are also responsible for that too. We all need to get used to it. Now, it's irreversible. Benjamin, let's go. You didn't eat anything. She can't do this. She just can't do this. What do we do? You can't continue like this. Force yourself. You can't die. How long will you punish yourself? God bless you. I don't know, maybe they were right. -What? -Maybe I went too far. I don't know. I like that. I'm so sad. It's not getting better. Were there any problems at the Alloca's? I don't think so. You need to call them. He's having a breakdown. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't. We need to wait for the council. This baby is in danger. He refuses to eat. Claire! We need to find loving families for these children. And we got lucky. They found each other. So, you do something. Anna, I can't, I don't have the right. You really suck. I'm done. I'm leaving. Come on! Drink. Keep your spirits up. All right. Paul, don't worry, he'll call back. Manu, you want a drink? Yes, I don't mind. It's my first farewell party. -People usually like when I leave. -Here, your farewell drink. Come on. Is Sali okay? Yes. She needs to rest. -Did the lawyer call? -No. Did you pay him? If you paid him, you're screwed. You know how they are. They take the money, they leave and you don't see them again. He's a friend of mine. He's the best. You never know. Here, drink. Drink! -Come on. -No. Come on. You should not lose hope. Yeah. The renovation is over. So, to Manu! To Manu for the end of the renovation. To Manu. Well... Thanks. Yes, I... I'm glad I worked well. Yes, that's nice. It's weird. Not so long ago, we opened the shop. We had the house. Benjamin. And now... I thought we would make it. I don't like to see you like this. Paul. Listen... You stayed with my daughter many years when you wanted children but she couldn't have any. Yes. I never told you but you are a good man. She's lucky to have a man who loves her. Yep. And... about the kid. He was lucky to have you both as parents. He was super lucky. Yes, super lucky! But now... My God, what did I do? It's my fault if he doesn't have a family. No, Mamita. -My little Lamine. -No. Lamine, yes. No, no. No. No, no, Mamita. It's not your fault. Of course not. -It is. It's because of her. -No. You see, Manu says it. No... Manu! It's a little bit her fault! Oh, my grandson! You need to drink. -Hey! -No. Paul! Benjamin is not well. He's not eating. They're sending him to the hospital. We have to go. I won't let my godson starve! I'm the godfather! Let's move it! No, the lawyer said to wait, so we wait. The lawyer? Screw him! -Yes! -Screw him! The baby has to eat! Let's go, Paulo! -We're going! -Let's go! -Come on! -You're right, let's go. -I need to do something. -Come on! Hurry, let's go. Come on, Manu! Wait for me! Come on! Manu! -The car keys! -The keys! Let's hurry up! You got the key? Yes, I have it. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Manu! -Wait. Do you have your license? -Well, yes, I think so. No, not "I think so." You have it or not? I didn't want to drive! I took the last spot. Enough talking, let's go! Go! Go! Go! Go! -Careful, speed camera! -Where? I'm here, grandson. This way! -You sure? -No, it's that way! It's that way! Benjamin! I'm coming to see Benjamin Alloca. Like allowance, and "ca". -Which Benjamin? -Benjamin? Benjamin, my baby! -He's over there! -Where? Benjamin! Hello, baby! Hello, my baby. What are you doing here? We came to see Benjamin. But who are you? His family! Well, then... The parents, come. Thank you. No, I said the parents. I'm going to feed my son. -Wait. -We are his parents. We just came to feed him. He needs to eat. Mamita, you see? He's moving, he's not dead. He's alive. Are you a doctor? -Leave that child alone. -We don't have time. They called security! They're kidnapping a child! -Should we run? -Let's run! Run away, I'll cover you. What's going on? Quick, quick! You, there! Sir. Manu! -Take the bed. -I'll hold the door. Get out of there. Hurry up! We're not Superman. -Hold the door. -We're feeding him. Go fuck yourselves! Go fuck yourselves! Prune, there's a child here. You have a great energy. It's ready, baby. Here you go. Come and eat. -Are you sure it's not too hot? -It's barely warm. No! Mom, it's okay! There's a bad energy now. Baby, make an effort. He doesn't want to eat. -Hurry up! -Yes, but... He doesn't want to eat. We should sing him a song. Eat. Come, Manu. Please! They're coming. My supervisors are coming. Why do I have a whole family barricading itself in my hospital? Dear colleague. I'm not your colleague. You have 5 minutes. Otherwise, I'll call the police. -Did you tell the Allocas? -Yes. Are you crazy? What were you thinking? For Benjamin. I know what to do. If they think they'll keep the child... They just came to feed their child. No, they're sequestering him. In my hospital. We have a hostage situation. I'm calling the police. No, don't call! I'll take care of it. Claire! Okay, go and see what's going on. I'm not a locksmith, I'm the maintenance guy. -Let's break it. -No. We wait. -We break it. -No! We wait for the director. Madam! Paul, Sali! Open the door, it's Mrs. Mallet. It's Claire Mallet! I saw you, Zlatan. I saw you! -Fuck, she recognized me. -Paul, Sali! Come out with Benjamin. They sent a negotiator. We'll won't come out until my godson burps. These are our conditions. We're gonna need pacifiers and diapers. Shut your mouth. We want pizzas, too. Fifteen minutes. Who wants to share a four-cheese? All I did was for Benjamin. Not against you. We just want to feed him. They called the police! Please come out before it's too late! Otherwise, we can't help you. The windows! There must be snipers. Granny's here, baby. What do we do? I can't hold them for too long. They're gonna kill us all. I beg you. Come on, baby, it's okay. It's okay. We're sorry, we didn't want to cause any trouble. Promise me... to find him a nice family. You are his family. I'm sorry, I... I was completely wrong. It had never happened before, so... You are the first ones. You are a beautiful family. I don't understand. That's what we'll tell the council. He burped. -Yes! -Yes! Come here, Mrs. Mallet! Sir, what do we do? Nothing. Mamita! We made it! So we're not breaking anything? You see, Benjamin, we are a family. Mamita! -Benjamin, you're the best! -Yeah, buddy! My little Lamine! He's cute! You grow so fast. Say hi to grandpa. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Benjamin Happy birthday to you On the count of three! One, two, three! You didn't blow it, they cheated! They blew out your candle. He wants to sleep. Now that all is well that ends well, we should talk about his circumcision. Paul!
