Line. She thinks she's fooling us with those sad, little eyes, but she's just like the others. Fear and pity. She'll betray us in the end. "Her hair is not even really blonde." ...since the time of our earliest ancestors, an innate and essentially human impulse. This very quality is what separates man from beast. It is a manifestation of our inherent desire "for order, for symmetry, for beauty." That's it, that's it. Oh, gentle. - Doctor. - Shh. Freida! Are you injured? I'll get Brutto. No, no, you can go. I'll see it to it myself. Let me speak with Freida alone. - But the patient... - Never mind that. - But, doctor... - Thank you, Olga. Yes, doctor, I'll be waiting. Freida, my dear. I warned you to stay in your quarters. The patients have very serious diseases. They are highly contagious. If anything ever were to happen to you... That sounded like a real gun. Is everyone okay? - What happened? - Cut! Cut! I think there are hunters out there. If anything ever were to happen to you, I'd never forgive myself. My hero, Max. Yeah, well. Excuse me, who's in charge here? - Not me. - Who is? Try Tetrallini. No, this one is imperfect. Yes, we will use this one. - Excuse me. - No, out. - Ma'am? - Yes, this one is perfect. No, take this one away. Ma'am, you need to move your trucks. They're blocking our driveway. Who can I speak to about that? Who's in charge here? - Coming through! - Excuse me, who should I speak to about moving the trucks. You need to talk to Tetrallini about that. It's got an all-child cast. Thought it was all dwarves. All children are dwarves, Aristotle said that. Excuse me! Your trucks are blocking our driveway. They need to move right now. Excuse me, can you help me with this? Just ask who you wanna ask, but just make sure... Do you know if the extras have any dietary restrictions? - I was told iceberg lettuce... - Tetrallini! Oh, excuse me. Sorry, is this the camera you're shooting with? - Yeah, crazy, right? - That's tiny. Yeah, they just keep getting smaller and smaller these days. It's really all about the lens, though. I could talk to you about that if you want. - I'm sure I can... - Sarah Wagner. - Yeah. - I'm Joan Beckett. - Hi. - I'm here to interview Mabel. Oh great to meet you. - Oh yeah. - Are you Tetrallini? - We just talked about that. - Have you seen... have you seen Mabel? - No, you could talk to Molly. - Tetrallini! Thank you. I'm a huge fan. - Oh, thank you. - Tetrallini! "We wait in long line for loaf of bread." I always wanted one, but it's such a serious commitment. Marked for life. How do you think of a symbol that's completely unique to you and perfectly expresses your individuality, like a barcode or something? My father says tattoos are an insult to God. Now how would the tattooed lady feel about that? Is there gonna be a tattooed lady? We'll find out tomorrow. Tomorrow. I wonder if there'll be a bearded lady. If not, I could play the part. Oh God, me too. You, I don't see anything suspicious. Look, look. No, that's like wispy silk down. I'm an ape woman. You obviously know. I've plucked much worse. Who? Code of silence. I guess that's good. I can trust you. Mabel, I wanted to introduce you to Ms. Bechdel. - Beckett, Joan Beckett. - Mabel. - Nice to meet you. - Ms. Beckett, I'm sorry. She's writing the article. I'll talk to you at the hotel. I don't want to bother you now. That's all right. We're just comparing facial hair. I have you all beat. I don't know. You have stiff competition. Molly, how's your beard? Oh, electrolysis. Best 1100 bucks I ever spent. Really, 1100? They do that here, I think, in the other wing. Female facial hair is making a comeback. I doubt that. - Do you regret it now, Molly? - No. It's true, armpit hair, short hair, Afros, eyeglasses, these things go in phases. - Scars are kind of a thing now. - Joaquin Phoenix. Even small breasts had a brief moment in history. I must've missed that one. What about you, Michelle? You need any work done? No, she's perfect. - Cut. - Cut! Try it again but, uh, moving away from the girl. It'd be more effective as she becomes dwarfed by these lonely sh... - Cut. - Cut! I guess so. Although, I don't make those distinctions. Well, there's always some distinction, in the working conditions, for instance. Okay, yeah, well, on a film like this, you kind of slum it. But I think that's part of the appeal. Like, the beauty is that it's more challenging, physically, mentally, and, um, also I'm just a huge fan of the director. It's his first American film. Yeah, but it still retains a kind of European sensibility, which is one thing I love. And I don't get cast in the mega-movie things anyway, so, I'm not the type. You're being modest. You're very beautiful. Thank you, but... Since we're on the topic, there are some bold casting choices in this film. I guess. Do you have any reservations about it? Reservations, like how? Um, I don't know. Do you feel, for example, this film might be considered exploitative? You know, I think that's up to the director. It's in the script. Have you read it? No. I think this is something he relates to. He had very serious asthma, or something like that, as a child. And so I think it's a very personal, like, sad tale. And he said he grew up in the circus, but I think he exaggerates. Playing a blind woman must be challenging. Mm, but that's the job, right? Acting is acting. Like, um, Orson Welles, who's white, can play Othello, who's black, obviously, but then he can also turn around and be the other... - Iago. - Iago, right, if he wanted. Daniel Day-Lewis, such a gifted actor, he can play... he played a hopeless cripple, and then he turned around and played a great American president. So that's a challenge. But blindness, it's also not a totally foreign concept, because, you know, blindness is an illness, but it's also a metaphor, right. We're all blind in certain ways. We're, like, blind to our own best interests or blind to the suffering of others. And I think that blind people, they feel shut... they feel excluded from, yeah, and I certainly relate to that. I'm sure you do too. Sure. "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow." Well, that's from that, uh, it's from a musical, right? It's the little rich orphan kid. What? No. "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps "in this petty pace from day to day." Doesn't ring a bell, man. Everybody knows this. You sure it's not about a rich orphan? Well, kind of. It's got an all-black cast. - American film? - Are you fucking kidding me? - Yeah. - First, the tattoos, then the mask is three weeks late... I have a concern. - Maybe I'm just not getting it. - One moment, Mabel. Um, I was just thinking about the beauty of eyes or the measure of their beauty and it's not their shape. And can you tell by touching them? What are you talking about? When she feels his face? Who does, whose face? Freida touches Rosenthal's face. And? Well, can she tell by touching his face that he has beautiful eyes? Why are you bringing this to me now? Well, I was just thinking about it, and it doesn't make sense. Sure it does. But eyes are like moist, and I don't think he wants her poking... She's not meant to be sticking her fingers into his eye socket. Yeah, I know, I know. But aren't eyes, like, all the same shape? I don't know that that's true. I don't see how you can just make a statement like that. Can you touch a person's eyes and tell me if they're beautiful or... Monstrous? Me, maybe no, but I'm not a blind. I don't read Braille. I don't have superhuman musical abilities. But Freida... Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Disagree. Even if it is... It isn't. But eyes are, like, considered beautiful, 'cause of their color, or maybe it's their placement, but it's not the way they physically feel. You're saying that as someone who has sight, as a seeing woman. You're not thinking like Freida. Vanessa, the script! At this ungodly hour. Sorry. Here. Read it. I have: "Rosenthal:" Page? 118. So it's "Rosenthal: "'Please, no, don't.' "Freida:" "There's nothing to be afraid of." "She places her hands on his face, "feeling the contours of his exaggerated features "but does so with a kind of tenderness. "Rosenthal seems frightened "but also, in a sense, grateful. "Freida: 'I think you're beautiful.' "Rosenthal: 'Me, beautiful?' "Freida: 'Especially your eyes, "'you have such beautiful eyes.' "Rosenthal: 'Why are you so kind to me?'" I don't know, it doesn't... It's not altogether logical, but it has a kind of poetic truth, a rhapsodic truth. No, stop, don't smile. - I never do. - It's true. That's the best way to prevent wrinkles. I was joking. I smile. - Eh, Eh. - Don't! Stop it! - You're gonna ruin it. - God, when does it stop hurting. Oh, stop complaining. This isn't even available to the public yet. You have to know somebody. Who do you know? Dr. Lichter. He lives in my mom's building. It's the same guy who did Max's hair. Max's hair isn't real? I mean, it's real. It's stem cells or something. I don't know, possibly his own. What an amazing time to be alive. Look, you're on TV. Jesus, everywhere I look, there I am. Got to get used to being seen sometime. I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian. Truly, the more to blame he. We were Christians enough before. Even as many as could well live one by another. This making Christians will raise the price of hogs. Ugh, Shakespeare's the worst. That's the classiest thing I've ever done. - Until now. - We'll see. All right, I got to wash this off. No, it's working. - It's burning. - Burning is good. - Give it time. - How much time? Weeks, years, decades. I thought time was the enemy. Befriend the enemy. How long have you been using it? - Two days. - Oh, your commitment is truly astonishing. You laugh now but we'll see who's laughing in 30 years. I never laugh, remember? I didn't say that. I said you never smile. We have an update on a string of murders that has the whole community living in fear. Now, police are seeking a man for questioning. He's described as having a mark on his face. He has these marks or scars kind of burned on his face. They were on, like, the left side. - Thank you. - Well, no, actually, they were all over his face. But there was just something really off about him. - I think he likes you. - We'll no doubt be hearing more about this as the case develops. In the meantime, please, keep your eyes open and remain alert. I can't believe it. You're on television. I was hoping nobody would notice. It's my early work. Nonsense. Of course, if you were gonna do it faithfully, as Shakespeare would've wanted it performed, it'd be an all-male cast. A modern interpretation. Which I support. Did you know our director grew up in the circus? I heard. When I was a boy, that was my dream. That's a strange dream, I'd say. An experience like that can really warp a man's mind. Maybe that's why he's a genius. What was your childhood dream? Uh, it was to be a waitress. Easily realized. Yeah, pretty sure that warped my mind. But I would still prefer it to joining the circus. Oh no. Never happened for me, though. Poor Max. What will you dream about tonight? My dreams are lame. It'll probably just be about going to work. I'll be in it then. I never remember my dreams. Shame. I never forget mine. Get good sleep. Tomorrow, all your dreams may come true. - Did you know Orson Welles... - You know, sideshows have been around in one form or another for hundreds of years. - And people criticize them. - What's that Welles' movie - with the white Mexican? - 'Cause people criticize the unknown, that's a human impulse... Touch of Evil, Charlton Heston. Isn't there a different one with a woman, - a white Mexican woman? - But in reality, sideshows benefited people with disabilities who had no other means of supporting themselves. Who's gonna employ them in like the 1930s, the president? - I'm gonna... - Nicole Kidman as an American. Is that a drone? I think it's a drone. It is so good to meet... It is really nice to meet you. What are you doing? - I just have to wash my hands. - Me too. But I didn't say anything. - Oh! - Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. No, I didn't, um... No, I didn't know anyone was in here. - I'm sorry. - My fault. No, no, no, no, no. No, it's not your fault. - It's not your fault at all. - Do you need help? No, it's just my medication. - It's my bad, sorry. - No, no. Crafty's down there. Holding is down there. Restrooms are upstairs. Elevators are broken. This is Michelle, our fabulous makeup girl, be nice to her. - We doing makeup with them? - I don't know. Mabel, where have you been hiding? You've got to meet Rosenthal. Hi, honor, pleasure. - Hi, yeah, nice to... - Mabel, wardrobe meeting. We got a movie on our hands. Right this way, guys, your rooms are at the end of the hall. Don't tell me, don't tell me, Phrosa, Clementine, Nora, the Mozes twins, Eve and Miriam, that's an easy one. Okay, everyone, you can grab a bed and get a toothbrush and a washcloth. Okay, who's been in a film before... I'm sorry, a movie? - Who's been in a movie before? - Oh, I have. You have, what have you been in? It was called Triumph of the Ill. Triumph of the Ill, that's a great title. - Yeah, it's good. - I don't think it ever came out. Well, it happens. You, Aristotle, have you been in a film before? One was called Life Unworthy of Life, and the other, I think it was called Enemy of the Gods. - Uh, Gods' Mistakes. - Yes, Gods' Mistakes. Enemy of the Gods was the German title. - Feind der Goötter. - I think I saw that, actually. How was it? Powerful. If it's the one I'm thinking of. Max, you bring the doctors out here, one doctor, out. Yes, come forward, and you see it, up! You, up, up! Do the walk, do the walk. Now you see him, but you do not observe him. You're still moving, still moving. - "They turn away in horror." - Little lower! - "They taunt me." - Lower, higher. - "And beg me to show my face." - Up, up! "Only so that when I do, "they can turn away in horror." "They taunt me and beg me to show my face. "Only so that that when I do, "they can turn away in horror." "They taunt me..." Hey, you're all alone over here. All this dialogue, it just goes on and on. I can't remember it. Oh, everyone's nervous on their first day of a shoot. I don't want to mess this up. Our director is intimidating. You know, he's not really. It's his accent. It makes him sound like a villain. How am I possibly supposed to remember all these lines? Lines are the easy part. You've done this before, yeah? If a school play counts, then sure. Yeah, this is gonna be a piece of cake then. Do you have representation? Representation? - Yeah. - No, not that I know of. Okay, so the first trick to learning your lines is to stop worrying. I'm on this medication. It affects my memory or something. Well, we'll rehearse together if you like. Yeah, thank you. That's very kind of you. I could pay you for lessons. No, I'd be a hopeless teacher. I'm terrible with kids. Yeah, kids hate me, too. That's ridiculous. No, they're genuinely terrified of me. I think you're paranoid, because children are like mindless drones. It's probably that you're afraid of them. Oh, I'm absolutely afraid of them. So you're not, you're not a father then? No. Like, do you have a dog or a cat? Oh no, they hate me too. Dogs bark at me and cats tend to hiss at me. All right, now I know you're kidding. No, anything below cat or dog: Snail, cockroach, plankton, they're mildly indifferent to me. You're hilarious. All right, I'm on to you. I think you're trying to lower my expectations so that you can run away with the movie and put me to shame. I'd need to know my lines before I could do that. You wouldn't be the first actor that didn't know their lines. But I'll help you if you need it, which you don't. You don't seem convinced. What do you want to know? How to act. That's all? Just start from the beginning. Hmm, name an emotion. An emotion? Yeah, just name one, like any emotion. I can't think of one. You can't think of an emotion? Is that the medication, too? Yeah, maybe. Like, sadness. Okay, sadness. See? Acting. Okay. All right, I've got one. Great. Happiness. Hmm, opposite of sadness. That's what I hear. I have to remember. Um... Oh yeah. You're ecstatic. So you think. Okay, okay, let's try fear. Yeah, I recognize that reaction. Okay, how about empathy? Empathy? That's... that one's very advanced. Um, a minute ago, you couldn't name any emotion. Yeah, but they're all coming back to me now. So empathy, in three, two, one, action. Ah, it looks a lot like pity. But all the same, I'm touched. You're really very talented, I must say. Tell my father that. And did you like how I shouted action? So good, but that one's not your job. Ah, I thought I'd be bold. Oh wait, you didn't say cut. So the scene's still going on? Oh yeah, it's your turn. - No, no, no. - No, happiness. That's actually unfair, because I'm already really happy anyway. Look, check it, see how happy I am? See how actually for real happy I am. Clearly. Uh, hair and makeup's ready for you. Keep the shadow out of the frame. Take it out of the frame. Maybe we want it in the frame. Is that good? Highlights the artificiality. And his reaction was, I see this as being very damaging to capitalism. If only. Aren't his movies on there? Yeah, all 11, including the shorts. He said, I don't make movies to make money, I want people to see them! - Hey! - Yes, officer. Anybody you notice with identifying markings or characteristics, scars, amputations... - Uh, let me... - Tattoos. Let me get you Tetrallini... If you just stay right there, I'll just be right back, okay? Stay right there. Come forward, forward. Come right there, there, stop. Up! Stop! Rosenthal, just stand in the shadows, and when I say action, you stand there for a few seconds. Mabel will speak her line. - Then walk out into the light. - Walk out? Step out of the shadows and into the light. - Got it. - Let us now try it. This is just a rehearsal. Action! Who's there? Don't be frightened. No, but you need to say it exactly as you're emerging from the shadows into the light. Who's there? - Don't be frightened. - Cut, no, no. First, wait five seconds. - Okay, sorry. - And just step, do not just walk out. - Don't? - Step out. So one step? A solitary step out of the shadows and into the light. - Okay. - Can we try it? Who's there? Don't be frightened. That was better, much better, but you still, you must step, make your reach longer. The shadow is still, we shall conquer this problem. Maybe we can move the light back. The light is beautiful, if he would just do as I asked and lengthen his step. Mark it, put a mark down. Rosenthal, step to the tape, but do not look at the tape. You must understand. Who's there? Don't be frightened. Progress. Am I standing too long in the shadows? No, in fact, is it long enough? How does it appear, Frank? Where's Frank? Why am I standing in the shadows? Because this is your entrance. From where? For the entire film; this is your introduction as a character, to the audience, to the paying public. So far, you have been seen only in shadows. But your face, your identity, is a mystery. And what exactly am I doing? - Just standing there. - Standing there? It feels unnatural, because it is stylized, maximum effectiveness. I'm just asking to get a feel for the whole thing. - So, like, what is... - You are hiding in the shadows, because you are afraid, because you are in an unfamiliar place, and you sense something is not right here. So you are hiding, because you smell fear. And then I just walk out? You do not walk out. You step out into the light. It is an introduction. It is an amazing moment because the audience has not seen you yet. You have been withheld just like Orson Welles in The Muppet Movie. You've seen this movie, no? - No. - You know, these Muppets, you would like them. They are not fully beasts and not fully human. They are half-breeds, like the great god, Anubis. Yeah, I know who the Muppets are. These half-men, these Muppets, have spent the whole motion picture sojourning westward across the entire United States of America to go to Hollywood, to see this big studio man. When they finally reach the motion picture studio, after a grueling journey, they connive their way past the no-trespassing signs, past the uniformed officers. They walk into this big studio man's office. And the big studio man is there. This essential man upon whom everything depends. But we do not see him just yet, for he has his back turned to the Muppets and to us. And we think it will just be some regular man. But then he turns in his chair, and we delight in the discovery that it is Orson Welles. It is a fabulous surprise for the audience, for the paying public, a kind of, how would you say, a reward, a shock. Their money's worth. We do not know who stands here in these shadows. It could be Orson Welles. It could be anybody. But it is you, in this case, and it will create a very nice moment. - Okay. - Is that clear? - Sure. - Is it clear? I think so. Let us do it this time with Freida's line first, and let us really shoot it because this is digital. We can just shoot everything. We should've been shooting all of this. Hey, hey, great stuff, man. You got a gift. - Come see the baby. - What baby? For the baby scene. It's a tiny, little actor. We should... oh, babies hate you. - Yeah. - Children and dogs hate him. - Oh, that simply isn't true. - And cats. Everything but single-celled organisms. - That's not exactly what I said. - Dogs love everybody. Not me, they smell fear. Why are you so hard on yourself? - No, don't cry. - No, no, dogs are innocent. - Look, see how good? - Nein! The suffering must be real. This is just Frank. Imagine if we get Mel Gibson... - No! - Or Kevin Spacey. - No! - This is just a mock-up. It is essential that his maladies be real. That is the code that I have sworn to honor. Besides it would be too expensive to get a real actor. Then we must do so much hours of makeup and prosthetics every day. Well, actually, with the insurance and liabilities, I don't want you to have to worry about any of that, though. Or we do it digitally. I mean, digital effects are the plastic surgery of the moving image. I mean, a little touch-up here and there, like nothing too noticeable. I don't know. It's just an amazing time to be alive. She thinks she's fooling us with those sad, little eyes, but she's just like the others. - Fear and pity. - She'll betray us in the end. Her hair's not even really blonde. Mabel. Mabel, new pages for you. - Thank you. - Yup. What kind of camera? - Oh, this is... - Oh I knew it! A celluloid man. Yeah, just don't open the... Some people say there's no difference. Not me, I'm like you. Don't have your eye, but... you talk to Matt, set photographer? I've seen him around, but I don't think I've spoken to him. I'll introduce you. He's competent. Shoots digital, like everybody these days. Makes sense in his line of work. But he's not doing what you're doing. You got a natural talent, acting, photography. Things just come easy to you. Thanks, if you say so. I do say so. I admire your gift, even if it is God-given, so to speak. Yeah, everything has been really interesting so far. I'd love to get a photo. Sure, that'd be great. Hey, you, come take our picture. Come. I'd rather you took it, but it's impossible. Ah, we could take a selfie. Selfies. Ready? Three, two, one. Wait, wait, one more. Okay, ready? You want one? Uh, sure, if that's cool. All right, three, two, one, smile! Back to work. That was great. I want a copy of this. You probably develop it yourself. No, I don't really like to mess with the chemicals. And I'm on this medication that... Do you not like me for some reason? I don't know you. I am who I am. I can't change, so... I like you, yeah. Happy to hear it. I like you, too. I respect you. You'd make a great Richard the Third. Olivier undermined the whole part, because he was too vain to be defective. Not me, I'd slather my whole face with latex. It would suit me. I hate to be looked at. I was an Arab woman in my former life. I really believe that. That's why I'm ashamed to show my face. I'm insanely shy. Yeah, I'm kind of shy, too. Oh, you're not shy. You're contemplative, circumspect. Guarded? - Who do you think you are? - Sorry. This is not a playground. Your people are running around, over by our side, right near our patients and families. They're scaring the children. I don't think they should be left on their own. I warned Goodrich that this would happen, but no one listens to me. This place is so big. We're the oldest and largest hospital in the state. It was funded by Carnegie. We were forced to close in the 1950s, but in 2001, Dr. Goodrich reopened it. Look. It was an all-female cast. Oh yeah, I did see that one. Have you talked to Rosenthal? He's amazing. Mabel seems to like him. I need to talk to somebody. Who am I gonna talk to? Phrosa and Aristotle, let's talk to them. Oh damn it. Stella, I like her. Fascinating. I love the struggle. Who's that girl Rosenthal's talking to? "Heard melodies are sweet, "but those unheard are sweeter. "Therefore, ye soft pipes, play on." There's a bearded lady after all. Guess I didn't get the part. It's not too late. The movie's not over. Who is that dancing with Rosenthal? I think she's his wife. I didn't know he was married. What do you think about the Siamese twins? Eva and Miriam? Very pretty. Yeah, but I don't think they're real. What do you mean? I mean, I think that Siamese twins have been phased out, you know, like, at least in the First World. Well, maybe those two couldn't be separated for some reason. If they were attached at the skull maybe, but at the hip like that, that's, like, a simple procedure. They could do that in the Carnegie wing. Maybe. Well, they're twins, anyway. Sure, sure. And that one, the half-man, half-woman. Jack-Jacqueline. She doesn't talk much. Or is it a he? I mean, it has to be one or the other. All right, that's not a real thing. A hermaphrodite? Sure. Yeah, but, like, split down the middle like that, she's a fraud. I think it's a he. He's a fraud. Well, Rosenthal's definitely real and Brutto, the little person. It's a pretty impressive lineup. How do you know she's his wife? I don't know. I just kind of assumed. Who is that? That's you, after you get burned. I thought that it was just gonna be one quick shot. Real suffering. "We must honor this code." And I also don't think that the director's actually German. They say he grew up in the circus. I view it as a form of cinematic hygiene. We tell ourselves stories in order to live. That's great. Who said that? Did you make that up? Be careful of that fucking pig. I'm not an animal. We're the oldest and largest hospital in the state. It was funded by Carnegie. - She's beautiful. - Who? The, um, Japanese girl you were dancing with. Oh yeah, her. She's your wife? Yeah. Uh, how, how did you meet? I've never seen her before in my life. You're not married. No, not me. I'll be a bachelor 'til I die. Why do you say that? I mean, there's someone for everyone. Ah, maybe I'm just a bit too picky. What about you? Are you married? So we're both picky. Eh, I blame my father. No one was ever good enough for me, or maybe I wasn't good enough for anyone. Anyway, um, you, you saw the new pages? Oh, my God, yeah. - I'm, I'm so sorry. - Why are you sorry? Well, 'cause I assume you didn't sign up to do that thing with me. And if you don't want to do that, I can totally back you up. Is it a problem for you? No, no, I'll do what I'm told and whatever the scene calls for. It's a visual medium, right? It might be really effective. You sound like Max. We could demand stunt doubles. I don't know if lovemaking counts as a stunt. Anyway, it won't be so bad, will it? Smile! Don't look too happy. His wife will be jealous. She's not his wife. That's my camera. Hey, what happened to the others? Where's Rosenthal? Oh, he's not coming. They're staying here. - What? - The hotel's too small and it's not handicapped-accessible. There are plenty of beds at the hospital. Plus, they're guarding the camera equipment, too, so... Yeah, but if the hotel is built for the hospital, why wouldn't it be handicapped-accessible? Built in less enlightened times, I guess. Hey, are they alone in there? I'd give a million dollars to know what goes on in there. Are you going back out tonight? That's kind of a personal question. We're locking the doors early. A body was found just up the road. Dead? The killer. We might have walked right by him. They spotted a man in the woods. He's real kind of messed up looking: Scars or something. Well, don't look at me. I don't have any scars, clean. I don't have any distinguishing features, not even a, what do you call it, a mole. That is your distinguishing feature, total blandness. - Herr Director? - Yeah, yeah. Which do you prefer for the portrait Rosenthal paints of Freida? Well, well, ideally, I'd like to use this abstract one. It is almost as if she is becoming one of them. Yeah, but can you tell it's her? Hmm, unfortunately, it is not so obvious. Uh, where is everybody? Camera's busted. We can't shoot. Everybody's in the auditorium. They're gonna screen dailies. Oh. - I love him. - I love him. Sounds convincing, action. I love him. What a horrible thought. A beast. Surely you know I could never allow it. Max, put your hand... Turn your head slightly for me. Yes, yes, that's perfect. When I paint, I can remake the world as I wish it to be. Brother says he's getting close. I do not want to get my hopes up, but to think that then I'll see all the colors. Then I can see you. Drop the paintbrush. I'm... I'm happy, if you could see, you, so young, so beautiful. You could own the world. Sorry? Say, "You could own the world." You could own the world. Your voice, there is something you want to tell me. I have a strong intuition about people. Let us not have secrets between us. May, I want to tell you. And yet, I've been so afraid. Come out and say it. It's my face. What about your face? If, or when, you see my face, you'll turn away in horror. Turn away, in horror, from you? What do you look like? I have this disease that makes my face look mutilated. Mutated. I have this disease that makes my face look mutated. No, I do not believe it. It's the truth. I'm an outcast. It's just, you're the first person that didn't scream. Perhaps my brother can fix your face. There's no hope. It really does not matter to me what you look like or if you have some terrible disease, not now, not when I see. Who you are inside, that's what I see. Your heart is gentle and kind, and therefore, you are beautiful. If others cannot see that, it is they who are blind. Action. You're not doing your dance. They're really just children, such innocent creatures. Now show the dance. - Faster. - Come, yes. - With the flute. - Do not make eye contact. Then, she like doesn't have the chops to pull it off. Quiet on set! My initial optimism was premature. The organs failed 12 hours after transplantation. I've failed again. I'm at 33? I think you're at 30. Tell me when I'm at 33. Keep doing it, right there. Okay, action! All right, I'll yell action, and then after that I'll just cue Brutto. - Uh, in a little bit? - Yeah. Right there. All right, action! Brutto. All right, back to one. Camera, set. Brutto! Leering, yes. Back to one. I like this composition, yeah. The soul has too many windows. - Set. - Brutto! Back to one. All right, Sarah, turn a beat earlier, half a beat earlier. Okay. Turn your head slightly to the right. Turn slightly to the right. Perfect. Oh, no, slightly left, yes. A little more left. Yes. Brutto. Brutto! Back to one. We now have the power to bend nature to our will. Do we not have a responsibility, a sacred duty, to eliminate disorder, to end aberrations? Sorry, I messed up the word, start again. Since you're starting over, just take a step to your left. Yeah. A centimeter. To end, to eliminate disorder, to... Eradicate! Eradicate aberrations. Slumping his head. We now have the power to bend nature to our wills. Do we not have a responsibility, a sacred duty, to eliminate disorder, to eradicate aberrations, to put an end to needless suffering? We now have the power to bend nature to our wills. Do we not have a responsibility, a sacred duty, to eliminate disorder, to eradicate aberrations, to end needless suffering, to take arms... I do not know whether he is a genius or a madman. Show them. You can do it. He's not an imbecile. Show them what you showed me. Don't be afraid. "Heard melodies are sweet, "but those unheard are sweeter. "Therefore, ye soft pipes, play on." You practiced with him! He's just repeating by rote. He doesn't understand the meaning of what he's saying. No! You said you'd help me, doctor. In time. I have done much for you, things that have made me ashamed. But I acted in desperation, 'cause you promised me a new face, a new life! Though I'm starting to suspect you might not be as sincere about holding up your end of the bargain. I've done it, my dear, just as I promised. The operation was a complete success. Is it really true? A medical breakthrough. Shh, sleep some more. You need rest. When you wake up, a new life will begin. No one must ever know that you are my... One more time. I almost said "son." No one must ever know that you are my brother. Who's there? Come closer. Let me see. We begin by registering all people... ...be it physical, ethnic... Get them away from me. Freida, why aren't you in... How did you... All of you, leave, at once! Rosenthal. I knew I could never... You said you'd help me, Dr. Otternschlag. Stop him. He's against all of you. We're all the same here, doctor. Freida, I thought you were one of us. Please, spare me. I can fix all of you. You can lead normal lives. I can set you free. All my knowledge, the success I've had with Freida, let me do the same with you. I'm your only hope. Nice try, doctor. Oh God! Freida. Brother! No, stay away from me! Stay away! You're a monster. Look, Freida, behind you! My face. My face. I wouldn't want to sleep there. I'd give a million dollars to know what goes on in there. It's a visual medium, so it serves as a kind of shorthand. A defect of the body is kind of ocular metaphor for defect of the soul. Look, Quasimodo, Achilles, Richard III, Bloster, Goliath, Tom Thumb, Captain Hook, Caliban, Krueger, Frankenstein, all bitter defectives. It's such a gamble when you get a face. Who said that? And the chariot is the vehicle that drives all of that. The empress and the emperor are overseeing this. Man, how do you do that? It's not him. - It's the cards. - Wow. How prophetic. - Nina! - Nora. Nora, you have to have Aristotle do your reading. I don't believe in that stuff, no offense. Oh, I don't usually, but wow. Maybe she doesn't want to know. What time is it? Some godforsaken hour. Oh, fuck. I got to go learn my goddamned lines. But trust me, this guy, got a gift. Hey, Brutto. What are you doing with that? What does it look like I'm doing? That's not our camera. They want us guarding the equipment. That is implicit permission to use it. Yeah. Let's make a movie. I have to memorize my lines. I'm not gonna be blamed if you break that. Anybody can use this. It's digital. I encourage this behavior. Does she agree? No, actually, I don't. So you're the evil one. I think that makes me the evil one. You're on the right. Left is the sinister one. Don't you know that? It's been years since somebody told me that. You girls ever acted before? Oh my God, do you guys never sleep? I'd stop messing around with that camera if I were you. I think we're being watched. Why are you so paranoid? We heard they were filming a movie in here. Yeah, we're just getting started. You want to be in a movie? It doesn't look like a movie. - Let me tell you a story. - No. Just listen. In the days of the Black Death... I don't care. I need to go. How many men have you made love to? Nobody, you know that. How could I know that? I mean, I can only hope. So you've never had a boyfriend? - No. - I'm gonna be the first. No, you won't. I know that. How could I not know that? But let me tell you something. When you do finally make love to a man, no matter who it is, if it isn't me, I don't know what I'll do. You won't do anything. I'll kill myself. A Family in Need is on. I have to go. A what is on? Oh God, you're so out of touch. Oh come on! Don't think I don't get it. There's some actor on a show, right, some hot actor. I mean, I just don't understand you sometimes. I thought you were the literary type. Turns out, you're just a child of television. No wonder you can't communicate properly with people. I think you need to grow up! No, I don't need to take this from you. You have no idea how to interact with people. All you do is yell and act bitter because you're deformed. - Oh, so you admit it now! - No, I didn't say that. You were the one that said you were deformed. Oh bullshit! Why can't we just do something fun? - This is fun. - This is not fun. Well, if you just relax! You may like it's a massive burden spending time with me. I mean, what the fuck else do you have to do, apart from go home and watch television? Smile, be happy, here, now. I am fantastic company! I am happy, okay, see? I like you fine. I'm just not attracted to you. I'm sorry. All you do is talk about us and ask me why our relationship is this way and why it can't be that way, and it makes me uncomfortable. People don't talk this way to each other. People certainly don't threaten suicide in the middle of a conversation. You don't talk this way to other people. You don't talk this way to Louis. I don't know how to react to you, other than to fall in love with you. But I can't. I won't. I wouldn't want to. I just think you need to lower your standards. Well, whatever happens, happens. Maybe I'll end up falling in love with you. Let's go see a movie. A Family in Need is on, and it's a really important episode. I can't miss it. I told you that already. Okay, we'll go. We'll watch it. Well, I'm watching it with my sister. You know, last night, I had the most unsettling nightmare. - Tell me. - I was in this hospital. And then we cut directly into the dream, right there. Who wrote this? - Brutto did. - Man. - You don't like it? - I like it. Doorways, I have to duck. Ceiling fans, chairs, transportation, like, you know, cars, airplanes, you? Countertops... How much do you think this hospital costs? How would I know? Nurse, how much does the hospital cost? An arm and a leg. I wonder if they take insurance. Brutto, you've had surgery, right? Yeah, of course. Like a lot of surgery? Yeah, I mean, yeah, so? Okay, do you not want to talk about it? I'll talk about it, but why are you asking? I mean, I mean, I'll tell you about my surgery. Nina, you've had surgery, right? My name's Nora. Nora, I apologize. But how much surgery have you had? It depends. - On what? - On what you call surgery. Well, I don't mean getting a tattoo. Let's put it that way. A lot then. Who do you think has had more, you or Brutto? I had some. Ah, and did your insurance cover it? - Some of it. - I don't have insurance. Are you serious? I can't afford it, so what? I tore a ligament in my knee, and I had to wear a cast for a year. - Interesting. - Is that not legitimate? Oh no, I'm not saying that it's not legitimate. I'm just commiserating with you. Okay then. Gee, now I feel left out. - Be glad about that. - Definitely. You don't need to feel left out. You've witnessed surgery. Yeah, like it's the same thing? Oh no, no, I know it's not the same, but yes, I've seen a lot, and it's affected me. And you're helping people, which is great. I get emotionally attached. To the breast implant patients? People die here. Of malpractice, maybe. That's one reason. I was joking. Not malpractice but all medical procedures carry risks, so percentage-wise, some people do die. It's not necessarily a result of malpractice. Some people don't tolerate anesthesia, for instance. But they need those breasts. They're willing to die for those breasts. You guys make it sound so trivial, but if a woman needs bigger breasts to feel confident and we live in a society that favors larger-chested women, how can you fault them for that? Look at your face. You weren't born like that. You had corrective surgery that wasn't medically necessary. I was an infant at the time. I didn't consent to any reconstructive surgery. Yeah, but your parents, or whoever, they took a risk, so you could fit better into society. What do you know about how I fit into society? I'm on your side. I'm just defending breast implants and saying that some people think it's necessary, and the risk is worth the reward. Yeah, but you act like everybody that goes in there, dies. That's absolutely not what I'm implying. We literally have the best doctors in the world. Dr. Godwin, right? Goodrich, Dr. Goodrich is the best. For what he does, he's the best. People come from literally all over the world to see him. - What's so great about him? - He's really good. He's pioneered all sorts of procedures. Look him up online. Maybe I should go see him. Oh, he's booked years in advance. - Years? - Mm-hmm. Rosenthal? - What is happening? - Rosenthal? Nurse, both of you, come on, do something. - I, I don't know. - I don't know what to do. Has this happened before? Someone call a doctor! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Okay, cut. That was fun. Okay, guys, please don't make me do that again. I'm sorry, everybody. I think we should try it one more time. What was wrong with it? It didn't feel real. Brutto, you were too aggressive. That's the way it was written. Well, let's just try to soften it a bit. Okay, coughing for real now. I'm not doing it again. You sound just like your character. Rosenthal, you write one. - Nah, I'm good. - Why not? It can be anything, something that you could never be in the real life. Well, I've always wanted to be a waiter. - To play one? - No, to actually be one. That's never gonna happen. Oh I know, but it would be great. Tell us about it, Rosenthal. So there I am, the hustle and bustle of the restaurant, waiter's uniform. I go up to a group of customers. They're in a booth in the corner. And I say to them, "Good evening, how are you?" And they reply, "Fine, thank you. "How are you?" "Well, it's a bit busy. "But I can't complain. "We have some specials on the menu tonight. "Would you like to see them?" They reply, "Yes, we would." The exchange continues as you think it would, till finally we get to the point where I say, "Are we ready to order?" One of the girls pipes up and says, "I'll have the tuna melt and a Diet Coke." You're working at a diner? Okay, one of the girls pipes up and says, "I'll have the Dover sole, please." Dover sole and a Diet Coke? One of the girls pipes up and says, "I'll have the Dover sole and a glass of red wine, please." Fish and red wine? Why is everyone looking at me? I don't even like movies. Someone else write one. I've got to learn my goddamned lines and take my goddamned medication. I'm done with this. I have a movie. I'm gonna go to bed. I've got to learn my goddamned lines. Oh great, now a woman wants to make a movie, and nobody wants to help. Hey, I made one. I'll help you. Maybe it's too ambitious for tonight anyways. No, tell us about it. Okay, well... My face. Real acid. Who did this? Hi, Mabel. It's great to see you again. Comfy? All right, turn to me. Okay. This is Lisa. She's a medical student. I hope you don't mind if she observes our exam, today. That's fine. So, Lisa, this is a very interesting case. Why don't you present her to me? Um, this is Mabel Fairchild. She's a 30-year-old, white female who originally presented to Trinity Hospital in 2017 with third-degree chemical burns resulting from an accident on a movie set. They affected 20% of her body, including her head, oral mucosa, neck, and left-upper extremity. In the ED, she was found to be hypotensive, was fluid resuscitated and then admitted to the ICU and was ultimately transferred to Mount Sinai, where there's a burn unit. Good, continue. - She also... - You're doing great. She also had a bout of acute renal failure, presumably due to ATN from her hypotensive episode, but that is now resolved. Surgery plastics and ophthalmology were all following. She had a flap procedure to reconstruct part of her nose and left buckle area, which she seems to have tolerated pretty well. Overall, she spent a month in the hospital and now presents for routine follow-up. The only thing of note is that she appears to have started smoking again, up to 1/2 pack a day, and her alcohol intake is up to five or more glasses of wine a week, which makes me a little concerned about whether there's a substance-related issue going on. Hmm. Can you actually make that two, on me? You're not drinking alone, are you? Here you go. Keep it. Has anyone ever done anything nice for you before? What do you want? I just want to buy a girl a drink. You just say thank you. Man, you try and do something nice for someone. Cheer up. Come meet my friends. - Just say it. - Say what? Say what you want to say! What do I want to say? Jesus, you're paranoid. Ice fucking cold. If you don't want to deal with people, maybe you shouldn't fucking go out in public. Keep the drink. You look like you need it. Hi, how are you? Fine. Are you ready to order? Yeah, tuna melt and a Diet Coke, please. Don't be frightened. Sorry, do I know you? You don't recognize me? Rosenthal! No, it can't be. What, what happened? Hard to believe, isn't it? It's impossible. How? Goodrich, you remember, the doctor from the hospital where we shot The Undesirables or Marked for Life, as it was called then. Goodrich fixed all of us, Phrosa, the twins, Aristotle. He saved us. I could never imagine. People get used to anything. But after a while, it just felt normal. But now that I'm free, I have my dream job. And I can't wait for you to meet Lily. Your wife? My dog. Dog's love me now, and I love dogs. You need to have the procedure. Feel my skin. It's real flesh, made from stem cells or something. He knows what happened to you, and he wants to help. Oh, I've seen so many doctors. But he's not a doctor. He's a miracle worker. I'm living proof. Do it, while you're still young. It's too late for me. Five years is nothing. You could even have your career back. - I'm too old. - Or who knows? There's loads of good roles in television, I hear. Anyway, it's never too late to be happy. You'd be crazy to refuse. Why suffer, for what? For nothing. Go to him. We can be together, Mabel. I'm so happy, I can't tell you. Rosenthal. It's you. I don't want to disturb you. No, don't go, though. Stay with me. No, please, don't. Why? You don't have to be afraid. I think you're beautiful. Me, beautiful? Especially your eyes. You have such beautiful eyes. Why are you so kind to me? Cut. She didn't do the German accent. What more can I do? Another take. No, I've done everything. Now I must wash my hands of this. We tell ourselves stories in order so that we might live. Man has been telling himself stories since the time of his earliest ancestors. It's an innate, human impulse, you know, the longing for, for order, for symmetry, for, you know, for beauty. Right, right. So a good story satisfies that longing, like a three-act structure. That's like an attractive woman or, God, you know, ideal, but an attainable one. Yeah, but if everything were ideal, then nothing would be ideal. That's why I like you, bright boy. The car's here whenever you're ready. Hey. Hi, before you go, I wanted to give you this from my secret stash. What is it? Dr. Lichter's Magic Cream. Ah, the anti-laughing cream. - Mm-hmm. - I'll try not to smile. I believe in you. You know Dr. Lichter? Oh yeah, he lives in my mom's building. You know him, too? Yeah, he's, um, a friend of my agent. What is this stuff? Oh, it's nothing. It's... - For girls. - It's for girls. - Well, then. - Yeah. Dr. Lichter is really a genius. - Mad genius. - Uh-huh. God, I feel left out not knowing this guy. We'll hook you up, one of us. Right, one of us. - Sarah. - Mm-hmm. If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to Mabel alone. Oh, I, uh, um, sure. What's this about anti-laughing cream? Uh, it's just a joke. "Laughter is never very far from derision." Who said that? I have no idea. Well, it's impressive... Latin. Dead language. You're keeping it alive. One day, it'll be gone. Well, not you, you're immortalized on celluloid. Another dead language. You wanted to talk about something. Yes, well, no, I just, well, Mabel, I wanted to say... ...it's been a pleasure working with you. Hello, madam. Hi. Are we having a good day? Pretty good. How's your day? Very good. Thank you for asking. We are going to the airport, yes? Yeah. You are an actress? I am. You are very beautiful. Thank you. Uh, shouldn't we have turned left? Ah, yes, madam, but the road is closed that way. They found a dead man. There's no way through. Police close it. The killer. I love movies. I see every movie ever made. - You know Indiana Jones? - Yeah. That is the best movie ever made. You and me are the same. We are both artists. You're an artist? Yes, madam, I am many, many things. Here, this is my book. Um... You wrote this? Yes, madam. What is it? I can't read the language. It is a story of how I escaped my country. What's your country? I am from Nigeria. You know Nigeria? Africa. Africa, that is right. My wife and children are there still. God, I'm sorry. But God has a plan. Yeah, he does. This is a book I write about my experience. I would next like to make a movie of it. It'll make a very, very good movie, because there's a lot of action. Who would you have play you? I will play myself. But if Hollywood wants to make this movie then, maybe we get Denzel Washington or Daniel Day-Lewis, oh, phenomenal actor. Well, you should have someone translate your book, so I can read it. I translated it. I'll download it when I get home. What is the title? Title is hard to translate. It means like, My Sad Tale, but I call it My Struggle, because this sound more commercial. If you like it, please give five-star review. And when I make this movie, you can be in the movie, too! Yeah. God, wow, that's incredible that you escaped, and you're a limo driver and a published author. Yes. I know nine languages. Wow. I am also a math wizard. Math? Yes. Let me demonstrate. Ask me to multiply something. Uh, uh... Give me two numbers, and I'll multiply them. I don't know. I can't think of any. You cannot think of two numbers? Six and 20? No, madam, that is too easy. Much harder, give me much harder. 642 times 9,060. 642 times 9,060 is, uh, 5,816,520. Wow. Look it up on your mobile phone. Oh, uh, say that again. 5,816,520. That's insane. How did... how did you do that? I am a math wizard. No, that's impossible. God, what else are you freakishly good at? I make a TV show. See this here? Is that a camera? Yes, I film my passengers. Are you filming now? Oh no, no, no. I always ask for permission before I film. I am very smart, and I do not want to get sued. So I always ask for verbal consent without fail. Will you consent? What is it for? I film my passengers answering math problems, and I want to make a TV show to help children learn math. Oh. But I'm terrible at math. I mean, I... I'd seem like an idiot. I know a special way to teach math. Look, right now, this is only a dream. But I will edit the show, put it on YouTube, and then it will get very popular. And then I get famous enough to ask President Trump to bring my family from Nigeria. And he will do as I ask. You're an extraordinary man. Will you consent to film? I leave it in your hands, but I will be very grateful if you would allow it.
