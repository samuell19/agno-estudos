I'm Kim Philby, Major. That is, Colonel Philby, KGB, retired. You'll find I have an appointment with General Govorshin, the Chairman of the KGB. General Govorshin left three hours ago. That's impossible. I was summoned for an important conference with him. I regret the Comrade General charged me to make an alternative arrangement. And what, pray, might that be? Major Valeri Alexeyevich Petrofsky. At ease. You are a fortunate man, Major Petrofsky. You have been chosen for a mission of the utmost importance. If you are successful, you will return to honours and promotions beyond your dreams. As Chairman of the KGB, I am giving you a direct order. You will accept my authority and my authority alone. You will consult neither your camp commandant nor the head of the Illegals Directorate. Nor will you reveal details of this mission to anyone. Major Pavlov here will be in charge of your briefing. If you have any questions, you will direct them to him. They tell me you are the star of the Illegals Directorate. You need to be. 'In London it's 16 minutes to midnight and here in Trafaigar Square, 'huge crowds are already gathering to welcome in the New Year. 'Everyone's in good spirits. 'The crowd is cheerful but orderly and the police have had an easy time. 'St John's Ambulance have had only a few people fainting. 'Up in the studio in Glasgow our Hogmanay party is in full swing, 'so let's go north of the border to join in the fun...' 'Nigel? I've got the reinforcements.' Drunken sod. It's Jeremy! Tell Nigel to open the fucking door. James. Happy New Year. - What flat, sir? - I've got the reinforcements for Nigel. Yes, but what flat number, sir? Don't worry. I'll follow the noise. 43, 42, 41... 40... 39... 38... 37... 36... Happy New Year. Bingo. Ah, Preston. Come and sit down. I've told the committee I did not authorise your action last night. I've also told them that you needlessly alerted Berenson by blowing up his safe. Presumably you have some explanation for this, Preston? We've got Berenson but we need the name of his controller. If Berenson believes it was a burglary, he won't be afraid to contact him. But why didn't you ask for my authorisation? You wouldn't have given it. - That'll be all, Preston. - Berenson's away, I take it? He's at a house party in Yorkshire with his wife. Yes, but tomorrow is Saturday, Sir Anthony. We don't expect him back until Monday. We'll pick him up then. Do you go along with that, Preston? - He has a girlfriend. - I'm sorry, what's that got to do with it? Quite. I wouldn't be surprised if he found a way to leave the wife in Yorkshire, come back early and start the New Year with a bang. I see. What do you want, Preston? Round-the-clock surveillance, three teams, phone tap, mail intercept. 24 men around the clock for an indefinite period? That would wreck three of our current operations. I'm sure you'll agree this Berenson is of overriding importance. Yes, of course, Sir Anthony. All right, Preston, you've got it. I suggest we reconvene after lunch. Preston? Got a moment? Close the door. Just what the hell do you think you're playing at? First you have the unmitigated gall to proceed without my permission, then you try to embarrass the service in front of that shit lrvine. I'm aware you consider yourself outside the normal chain of command but let me remind you that this is not a free-for-all and when you've finished showing off, you work for me. I, as director-general of the security service... Acting director-general. Bernard Hemmings isn't dead yet. Look, Preston, let's get this straight. If, or rather when, I am confirmed as head of this department, you are just going to disappear without trace. I will bear that in mind. Meantime, I want another report, complete in every detail, on my desk before you go home. Would that include this meeting, sir? Do it! Yes, sir. General Govorshin asked me to give you this. Your final instructions. OK. Could you put these in the car for me? Thank you. Nigel. Bernard. How are you? Terrible. But I'd rather you didn't mention it to Harcourt-Smith. Or has that little shit already got me dead and buried? Not quite, but he's confident he'll be your successor. Has he got rid of all my people? No. There are still a few flies in his ointment. John Preston in particular. Good man, John. What's he been up to? That's why I wanted to talk to you. 'Preston's caught that prick Berenson leaking NATO papers 'and I'd appreciate a little chat about what we might do with him.' - 'Hello?' - Julia? - 'George.' - How was your New Year? - 'How was yours?' - So-so. - How about tonight? - 'Yes, lovely.' - Seven? - 'OK.' - Fine. See you then. - 'Bye.' Bye. Oh, my God! - 'Hello?' - 'Julia? 'Sorry, darling. Something's come up. I'll have to skip tonight.' - 'Why? Is it Angela?' - No, it's the bloody office. - 'Oh, George. I'm sorry.' - So am I. I'll call you tomorrow. - Bye. - 'Bye.' "I like drinking at home..." "Uh-huh..." Chummy has gone to ground. Pizzeria on Phillimore Walk. 'Long way to go for a pizza. I think we'll join him.' Do you think Jimmy's overdoing it? Gloria don't seem to be objecting. - Well done, Charlie. - Hold on, here we go. Don't you like your pizza, Mr Berenson? No... we don't go. It's a drop. - What do we do about Berenson? - Better give him the first team. - Oh, shit! - What? Takeaway pizzas in boxes. William. The girl with the pizzas. Manager again. Who gets special service? He does. We'll take this one. Hello, Angela. Nigel lrvine. I'm sorry. Of course. How silly of me. Were we expecting you? Not exactly. Do you mind if we come in? No. Please do. - Is George in? - Yes, of course. Darling! - Hello, George. - Nigel. - How nice. - Might we have a quiet word? Yes, of course. Do sit down. Quiet New Year's holiday? Not missing something, are you? What do you want, Nigel? I thought you might be missing something. Like this. These are yours, I believe. But these, beyond a doubt... never were. There's not much I can say, is there? I don't know. Try me. All right. Well, for years now I've taken the attitude that there was only one struggle on this planet worth a damn. The fight against world Communism. It has long seemed to me ridiculous that the most committed anti-Communists, the South Africans. Should be excluded from NATO planning because of some unfashionable domestic attitudes. So was this your idea or did someone approach you? I met someone at a party. Or did he meet you? Jan Marais. Seems our secret service is up to scratch. Just what exactly have you been passing him? It would be awfully helpful to know. I gave him any relevant documents to NATO that crossed my desk. NATO? Mm-hm. I hope they didn't pay you in cash. The rand's taken a dive lately. I didn't do it for money. I did it because it was right. A man of principle to the last. You can bloody sneer but perhaps I'm more of a patriot than you. You may be interested in this. It's an extract from the debriefing of a recent Soviet defector which pinpoints a Soviet agent in the South African foreign service. And this is a summation of the South African internal investigation, which identifies the man as one Jan Marais. Oh, my God! - What have I done? - You've betrayed your country. You've passed untold numbers of secrets to Moscow and endangered the lives of British men and women. And, I'd say, you've weakened NATO. Perhaps irretrievably. Oh, my God! Just you and your schoolboy politics and your idiotically conceited faith in your own importance. Now... some of our more muscular colleagues favour taking you to a cell and going to work on you with a carving knife and a pair of pliers. The rest would like to feed you to the newspapers and throw what's left into prison for 20 years. It's a tricky choice, isn't it? However, this is what you will do. You will resume your special relationship with Moscow, only this time I shall be supplying the papers. Understand? Then later, when we've finished... we can decide what to do with you. I'm very grateful, Nigel. - Good operation. Damn good. - The turning of Berenson? No. The false flag recruitment. The way he was won. Very clever. I've been thinking - it reminds me of someone. Who? General Yevgeny Sergeyevich Karpov. Deputy Head, KGB. - Sort of your opposite number, then? - You could say that, yes. I shall enjoy feeding him a few wrong turns for a change. '..From the ruling Politburo. 'Geoffrey Stern, a well-known Kremlin watcher. 'We also have with us Colonel K, 'who quit Moscow to come to the West last year. 'Colonel, who's now the leader of the hardline group in the Politburo?' 'Certainly it will be the KGB chief, Govorshin.' 'How secure would you say he is? 'General Govorshin is in delicate situation. 'Unless comes some change in world power balance - 'to justify his hardline policies.' - 'You talk about a hard line...' '..KGB chief, Govorshin.' 'How secure would you say he is?' 'General Govorshin is in delicate situation. 'Unless comes some change in world power balance...' General Karpov, General Borisov on line one. - General Borisov. - 'General Karpov.' - Petrovic, how are you? - 'Fine. I need to talk to you.' - Yes? - 'It's serious. Can we meet today?' - Where are you? - 'I'm not in town. I'm fishing.' - I'll drive out this afternoon. - 'Good. Good.' - Natasha, I won't be back after lunch. - 'I'll call your driver.' No. I'll drive myself. Karpov, my friend! That was quick. - How are you? - I'm good. Nostrovya. Yevgeny Sergeyevich. How long have we known each other? Get to the point, Pavel Petrovic. Why are you stripping my department? - Why am I what? - Stripping me clean. Every day something new is taken from me. First, the best agent we have specialising in Britain. Major Valeri Petrofsky. Then a forged life story meticulously maintained over the years. A legend that fits Valeri Petrofsky like a glove... Where do you want me to start? Couriers, the documentations, radio men and the coding crystals for a sleeper transmitter you yourself planted when you were head of the KGB in London. What the hell are you mounting over there? Whose authority has been on all these transfers? Govorshin? But Comrade General Govorshin knows nothing of Western Europe. That's why I was sure that you knew of this. Pavel Petrovic, old friend, I give you my word... I'm not the one who's wrecking your department. Then what the hell is going on? - Yevgeny Sergeyevich, I'm sorry, I... - No. No. In your position, I would have thought the same. So who is advising Govorshin on England, apart from ourselves? You think he's trying to embarrass you? Maybe remove you? Not as far as I know. Though he and I have not had any, eh... fireside chats lately. Something's wrong here, Yevgeny. Take care. I'll look into it. Stay well, old friend. And stay silent. By the way, what's the name? - What's the name of the legend? - Ross. James Edward Ross. - Mr Ross? - Yes? I'm so sorry I'm late. I'm Jill Dunkley. - How do you do? - Absolute bloody mayhem up there. - I'm sorry? - The traffic. Quite frightful. I got stuck behind some motorised carrot pulper or something. I gather you're looking for a three-month let? Yes, that kind of thing. Are you a single man, Mr Ross? My wife will join me as soon as we sell our house. That's nice. This is the attic upstairs. I see. Thank you. Then there's the bathroom. And this is the second bedroom. There's the occasional sound from the American airbase, but I hope it doesn't bother you. No. It doesn't bother me at all. - Yes? - General. - Tell the first courier to proceed. - Yes, sir. 'Will passengers arriving on Swissair flight 307 'please collect their luggage from roundel two.' Hey! You must be our new neighbour. I suppose I must be. Jim Ross. Tom McWhirter. Anytime you feel like, drop around, huh? I'll do that. Thank you. 'You're a problem, Preston.' While you've been away, Mathers has been heading up your section and he's done an excellent job. So it would be unfair to push him back to his second slot. But as luck would have it, a vacancy has suddenly appeared. In C-5. C-5? That's airports and ports, isn't it? Do you know, I do believe it is. But you could look on it as a real career move. Well, you can't keep a good man down, can you, Mr Smith? I expect your talents will be equally appreciated in airports and ports. John, this telex just came in for you. Give it to Mathers. I don't work here any more. - Where are you working, then? - Airports and bloody ports! Hey! Where's your pass? Are you deaf or something? I want to see your pass. - Gold fillings. - Lily-white hands. Soft palms. So what we've got is a deck hand from a Russian trawler, who looks like he's never handled anything harder than soap, coming out of Glasgow docks at two in the morning. - No forged papers? - Nothing unusual at all. Let's have another look at these effects. - It's polonium. - What's polonium? Combined with lithium, the two form an initiator. - That's a detonator for a bomb. - A bomb? An atomic bomb. - Pull over, Gregoriev, will you? - Yes, sir. I understand you've been driving Comrade Colonel Philby lately. Yes, Comrade General. Up to Christmas. Where have you been driving him? Gregoriev, do you know who I am? So tell me. Where did you drive him? General, I've been forbidden to... Gregoriev, you have a wife and two children. You think they will like you driving an open Jeep in Afghanistan? So... where did you drive Colonel Philby? - Comrade Professor Krilov? - Yes. My name is General Karpov. May I have a word? Come in. Professor Krilov, in the interests of the state... I want you to tell me the plan that you and Philby have discussed with Govorshin. What authority do you have? My authority is my rank and my service. If you have nothing signed from the Comrade General Chairman, you have no authority at all. I might draw his attention to your line of questioning. That might not be a very good idea. Did you know that Philby has already gone missing? - What do you mean, gone missing? - Disappeared. The rumour is that he is dead. Shot on Govorshin's orders. That is not my concern. The man is reckless and weak. No doubt he has overstepped the mark. That mark is easily overstepped. You have a son, for instance. But... This can't be. You know we do not tolerate these "golden boys". Five years in a labour camp. Not everyone survives that. The dirt, the beatings... sodomy. The report is alarmist, irresponsible and backed by insufficient evidence. Evidence?! Can't you read? That disc can only be used as part of a trigger for an atom bomb! That remains to be seen. Don't think I don't know what's going on. You're trying to get back into favour by dreaming up some drama, of which you are the hero. And you're kicking out anybody who doesn't kiss your arse. But if you were to look at this thing straight, you'd see that something is going on. It is my prerogative, as head of the UK's security service... Acting head, sunshine! And you're acting like a complete arsehole! "No... further... action." And you are suspended for insubordination. Indefinitely. Fucking hell, Bazza, look what got 'ere. Will it bite me if I feed it? What you stinking out this carriage for, you bloody wog? Fuck off back to the jungle. Look at me when I'm talking, bitch! Just go away and die somewhere! Why don't all you black bastards just fuck off back to the jungle? And take your commie fucking bastard mates with you. What's your problem, toerag? You two related, eh? - Hello, Joan. - Hello. I'm staying in tonight. You can take the evening off. Thanks, Mr Preston. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Tiger. - Who's winning? - I am. 'Reports indicated that rioting continued in the black townships 'outside Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town.' Come on, Tiger. Bed. 'Scuffles broke out today 'as a further squadron of American F-111 bombers 'arrived at the US Air Force base at Baywaters. 'The F-111 s, the backbone of the American nuclear capability here, 'had flown nonstop from Texas, refuelling in mid-Atlantic.' if you could pass me that, sir. Hey. - You looking for someone? - No, not really. You got a room here? No, but I've got my car. Let's go, then. What do you want to do? 'And very soon, I would say.' 'They don't like this one bit, as you can see. 'But Daddy's in now, whether he likes it or not 'and I don't think any referee could stop him. 'Technically, his real name is Akiro. Getting the worst of it at the moment. 'He's taking it all out on him. 'There's the splash. There's the full splash. 'He'll never get up from that.' 'Not with that weight on him. In just eight minutes 49 'of this 20-minute tag contest 'has Daddy the winner, three falls to one...' Hey, Jim. Me and Eileen been figuring you could use a little entertainment. I'm rather busy at the moment. Hell, you ain't too busy to be watching TV. Come out to the base for a few beers. Thank you. That would be lovely. Just give me a couple of minutes, OK? "Anytime they tear down your symbols." "And they're burning you in effigy." "Yet the time that they're living, you know it's paid for themselves." "And of another eternity..." You ever done any bowling, Jimmy? "Oh, America, baby..." Goddamn! - You're pretty good, Jimmy. - Too damn good. I'll have to find something I can beat you at. "What are we gonna tell our friends when they say ooh-la-la..." Bartender! Now, don't tell me you've reached your limit, Jimmy boy? I usually try and stop after a gallon or so. No shit. You need vodka. Marty, come here. Give us two large Moscow Mules, pronto. Maybe that'll kick a hole in that famous British reserve. Nostrovya. That's Ruskie for "up yours". Nostrovya. "Wake up little Susie Wake up little Susie." "Well, what are we gonna tell your mama." "What are we gonna tell your pop." "Sometimes it's hard to be a woman." "Giving all your love..." Cool. You British are real cool. Most of these boys are just all hat and no cattle. Sounds painful. But I ought to be getting back, Eileen. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. - " But if you love him..." - OK. "You'll forgive him..." Yeah, you get real bored around here. These people treat us like such dopes. To tell the truth, I sometimes wonder what we're doing here at all. Yes. I can understand that. Do you get bored too, Jimmy? Bored stiff? I ought to be getting back. Come to fly a kite, sir? - Now I'll land it. - Very good. Go and get it. It's an interesting report, John. You're pretty sure about this? That there's a Soviet agent assembling an atomic bomb? Yes. I don't suppose you heard. A sleeper transmitter has just gone active in East Anglia. Sent two messages. The first two weeks ago but the second soon after your Glasgow incident. So he's asked for a replacement disc? And if you were still on the case, how would you track him down? We know he's at least one component short. I'd start with the recent immigration records of all Soviet bloc citizens and try to pick out the courier. All right. I'll have those records brought round to your flat. OK. Just keep Harcourt-Smith off my back. Oh, he's much too busy working on his knighthood. Timmy! First, there'll be a core of uranium - round and about five inches in diameter. There'll be a two-inch diameter hole right through the centre. Over here, we have a two-inch diameter rod, also uranium-235. When the rod is rammed into the heart of the fissionable core, the mass of the two together rises beyond the critical threshold and that's when things get exciting. The fissionable core will explode only if at criticality it's bombarded by a blizzard of neutrons, and the blizzard is created by the initiator - lithium and the polonium. What is it that sends the plug down the tube into the mass? Any old plastic explosive. You know about that. So what we're looking for is some plastic explosive, detonator, two small discs, a tube, a round metal case and a rod of uranium. 'And the uranium ball. Uranium is twice as heavy as lead.' That ball would take a strong man to lift two-handed. But in size it's about as big as a small football? 'Yeah. A child's football.' if an atomic bomb explodes on an American base, they'll be blamed for a nuclear accident and the British will kick them out. That will destroy NATO. But if Petrofsky is caught with those components, Russia will be blamed for breaking the Fourth Protocol. Govorshin would have forced us back into the Cold War. - Denounce him to the President. - On what evidence? What about this professor, eh... Kirov? - Krilov? - Krilov. Krilov would change his story in five minutes - if he lived that long. - Then Govorshin would destroy me. - He'd destroy us all. Govorshin need not last forever. I want to die in my bed. No. I can't. So... what will you do? Watch. Wait. - Hi. - Good evening. Next, please. May I have a look at your ticket, please? Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - Danke. Hi, Tiger. - Haven't you finished playing yet? - Not yet. - Can I have a go? - Mm-hm. Press one of those there. Charne is from East Germany. - Dussiaux. Where's he from? - Yugoslavia. Duskie... pfft... wicz is from? Czechoslovakia. And Dutz... ch... zzch is from? - Poland. - Poland. And they all came into Heathrow in February and March and nobody could pronounce their names. Mrs Vadna? How was your journey from Finland? Very comfortable, thank you. Mr Ross. Let me take your bags. Irina Vassilievna, Soviet Army Artillery, Research Directorate. Specialising in the design and construction of atomic shells. - Valeri Petrofsky. - How do you do? We have a problem, though. We're still missing one component. We got your message. - Yeah? - 'John, we've got a break.' - Barry. What is it? - 'The lead we needed.' - Yeah? - 'I'm on my way.' I'll be ready. This way. Here we are. And where are you sleeping? We're husband and wife, remember? I think not, Comrade Major. - So what have we got? - Austrian, name of Winkler. He had a duff visa, so immigration checked the passport. It's forged. Winkler was the name of a spy the FBI busted three years ago in California. We ran it through the computer, found out his real name was Ivan Timoshenko - a KGB agent specialising in radio equipment. - The transmitter in East Anglia. - Yes. He's booked on the 6:30 to Colchester tonight. We've got 15 minutes. We'd better get a move on. I'm doing my best, John. 'Platform six for the 18:30 to Clacton. 'Calling at Shenfield, Chelmsford, Witham and Colchester.' - Where will I be working? - Upstairs, in the attic. So... how about a drink? Slow down! Oi! 'Here is an announcement. 'The 18:35 from Norwich will now arrive at platform three. 'At platform three.' Don't! Keep that away from the ball. - How big is this bomb going to be? - One and a half kilotons. It should devastate two square miles. That's a lot of damage. I imagine it'll kill somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 people. Look who's here. All right, Tom? Hand me that battery. Tighten those struts, will you? There we are. Armed and primed. Now... you'll have two hours. To detonate, turn the key 90 degrees clockwise, press the button, then the timer's running. Is that clear? OK, let's move this. - Good. - When do I get the go signal? Radio Moscow English newscast's at nine. When you hear "Colonel Gaddafi" in the third item. - Colonel Gaddafi. OK. - Wait. Now I have to give you this. - Is everything all right? - Yes. Just confirming your instructions. I turn the key clockwise, press the button, then I have two hours before detonation. Yes. Two hours. I suppose I ought to tell Moscow we're ready. But before I go... I thought you'd get to that. Press down. That's it, now press down. Don't. The key... Your friend's arrived, Mr Hardcastle. Oh, thanks. Thank you. Hi, Barry. What did you find out? The place is owned by two Greek Cypriots. Entered the country in '76 and been in deep cover ever since. The KGB is really pulling out the family silver. Irvine thinks the transmitter's here? - Yeah. How about Winkler? - He's still in there. - Who'd you bring with you? - George. He's in a company Transit. You boys have everything covered, so I'll go and get some sleep. - John. - What? - Winkler's leaving. - Let him go. But he could be out of the country soon. So he'll tell Moscow that the Maldon transmitter is secure. Winkler's only small fry. I think the jackpot's in that café. And I feel lucky. 'Anti-nuclear protesters are streaming into Suffolk 'for tomorrow's demonstration at Baywaters, the American airbase.' 'The organisers claim that attendance would top 50,000 'in protest at the tactical nuclear weapons based there. 'The demonstration will be peaceful...' 'John. There's a man standing at the end of the road.' What does he look like? 'Tall, well-built, wearing a raincoat. 'He looks as though he's carrying something. 'He's moving towards the café.' - Got him. - Let me see. - What's he carrying? - I don't know. It's a motorcycle helmet. - Get over to the chalet, George. - Right. - 'John?' - Yeah. 'I've found the motorbike. Engine's still hot.' Fix a bleeper and come back here. Yes? From the transmitter in Britain, General Govorshin. Everything in place, awaiting signal. - Very well. - Sir. - George? - 'Yes, John.' Tell Irvine to hit the Greeks now. You guide them in. You want to take the next left. And then right. This guy's really moving. Where are we now? Into Suffolk, heading towards Ipswich. He's stopped. In the town. And then right again at the next one. He's still there. That's over four minutes. This must be it. What's happening? There's been a big accident. The main road's blocked. ...stopping their work. Get back, everybody. There could be danger. Hang on, Barry. All right, keep moving. Keep moving. Barry! Pull out! Pull out, quickly! You maniac! Come on! It's him. Blue XR3. Stop! Stop! Ahh! You're mad! - Who signed for this van? - You did. Ban the bomb! RAF Baywaters. - The American nuclear base. - He's going there. He's turned off to the right. Looks like a dead end. Keep going for about half a mile. I'll be in touch. 'Two people believed responsible for the attack 'were later shot dead by soldiers. We'll have our next news at 11 .' "All over the country..." "Always here with you." "Radio 2." Good morning. I've come to read the meter. - Now? - My identification. Jim Ross. That's right. How long has he lived here? - Two months. - Does he live alone? No, a woman arrived day before yesterday. I think it's his wife. So what's all this about? - I want to borrow this house for a while. - What? That's not his wife over there. He murdered his wife. - And three children. With a shotgun. - Oh, my God! 'This is the North American service of Radio Moscow.' 'l'm Nikolai Kornikov. 'With me in the studio are two Soviet jazz critics, 'Alexey Batashev and Dmitri Ukhov. 'And we are going to listen to some in-depth jazz, 'coming to you on your North American service of Radio Moscow.' Our friend is in Cherry Haze Close, northwest of the airbase. I'm in number 14, opposite. It's the solar house at the end of the row. Come in over the waste ground at the rear, the back door is open. Out. Sir Nigel lrvine, please. '- And with that we end... - ..From Radio Moscow.' 'Today we'll announce the results of our Russian language contest...' I'm in here, Barry. Upstairs. Front bedroom. Number 12. I think there's someone in the attic as well. Hello, Chief. He's in the house next to the American airbase at Baywaters. Yeah, I think we should. John, Bill, let's go! Captain Lyndhurst, assault team commander. Preston? Through there. - I'm Julian Lyndhurst. - John Preston. - What have they told you? - Just that he's a terrorist. He's more than just a terrorist. He is a top Soviet agent. Pro. - Is he alone? - Maybe there's a woman in there. He's armed with a bomb. How big a bomb? An atomic bomb. "Deep in my heart." "I do believe." "That we shall overcome some day" 'The time is nine o'clock. 'You are listening to the English language service of Radio Moscow. 'Here is the news. Your reader - Paul Koslow.' 'In Afghanistan, government forces assisted by their Soviet comrades 'continued their sweep against fascist CIA-backed rebels...' 'Entering Cherry Haze, 15 seconds.' Go ahead. 'The arrival of Soviet forces has been greeted with jubilation...' Ginger! - Hold position. There's a civilian. - Ginger! Ginger. Come on. Ginger, come down from there. We're bloody exposed out here. - '..While trying to join the rebels...' - Here, Ginger. Ginger, easy now. Ginger. '..Predicted further record grain harvests this year for Soviet agriculture. 'To a cheering crowd of farmers...' Easy. Easy. Oh, for Christ's sake. Ginger! '..And corn, thus setting an example to the whole nation. 'In Libya today, progressive Arab leaders 'invited by the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, 'met to discuss further measures 'in the struggle against American and Zionist imperialism in the Middle East. Let me go! Shut up. Don't shoot. It's me! We needed to talk to him! Sorry, boss. Orders. - I'll be a couple of minutes. - OK, Dad. We are gathered here today to give thanks for the life of Sir Bernard Hemmings. We are grateful for the privilege of having known him. For all of us, I believe, have had our lives enriched and enhanced by the example he has set us. Sir Bernard conducted himself throughout his career with unfailing cheerfulness, with generosity of spirit and with charity. - It's not too much to say... - Excuse me. Thank you. ...that his passing marks the end of an era. It is our fervent desire that he may gain here peace... Preston. What do you want? I've been trying to speak to you for two weeks. I want to know why the Russian was killed. He was crawling towards an atomic bomb. No, he wasn't. He was executed on your orders. Or was it on yours, General? Why did you send Winkler with the obviously forged passport to lead us to Petrofsky? You deliberately wasted the whole operation. Why did you do that, General? You and Irvine set it up, didn't you? You gave us Petrofsky in return for the evidence that you will use to destroy Govorshin. You could well become the next Chairman of the KGB. Preston, you're out of your depth. It's all a game to you, isn't it? You don't give a shit about anything except your lousy careers, neither of you. It's about time they put you in a fucking museum. Do you think he'll talk? Dad! - Where are we going? - Home.
