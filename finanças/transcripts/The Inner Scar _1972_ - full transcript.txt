Do you know what that means? That means that you won't even... have a chance... going to hell! I don't understand. I don't understand what difference it makes. Do you have anything to say? Stay away from me! Stay away! Stay away! No... No! No! Oh God! Oh God! It's not right! No! It's not true! Do you hear? I am afraid of time It seems to me like a pan without a handle A sign without light Disappearing, looking at my back that bends and breaks When the clouds at daybreak whirl through my breathless senses. The inner scar You don't frighten me. My only child be not so blind See what you hold There are no words no ears no eyes To show them what you know Their hands are old Their faces cold Their bodies close to freezing Their feelings fine The morning small Too small to fill their ways with breathing The evening tall My only child remember well The words that you are told For some of them it is only Easy to survive Their hands are old Their faces cold Their bodies close to freezing Their feelings fine The morning small The evening tall Your winding winds stood so All that is my own Where land and water meet Where on my soul I sit upon my bed Your ways have led me to bleed Every child will be able to weep Every wise man spoke of him Every keeper will be sleeper And a guide to ways unsure Your winding winds did sow All that is my own Where land and water meet Where on my soul I sit upon my bed Your ways have led me to bleed He who knows may pass on The word unknown And meet me on the desertshore Meet me on the desertshore Your winding winds did sow All that is my own Where land and water meet Where on my soul I sit upon my bed Your ways have led me to bleed Nonsense on my right! Mercy on my left! There is no mercy! There is no justice! The sea shall rise... Over your head and drown you all! All of you! To his spirit I confess A longing consumes his beautiful face It wearies, shaded from goodness being almighty His body lies still Dreaming, he finally forgets his compulsion I don't recognize the scream of jubilation That destroys the holy peace for me His silent mouth, his sleeping chest Awaiting delicately for sweet desire His body lies still Dreaming, he finally forgets his compulsion Oh King, let me be your guide On this wide beach Let me accompany you Take my hand I wish to give you everything That you hold dear Your glance falls into my tent Shena! Shena! Shena! We can never be here. We can never be here until we're gone. We can never be here. Not until we're gone. You know that. You know that. We can never be here. Not until we're gone. Not until we're gone. Little father of the people! I salute you. I come from a distant planet called Earth. I'm offering you this humble present... so that peace and love can be fulfilled. Newly bathed, drowned in blood. I salute you, child of nature. And I leave at your feet... this celestial body of eternity. He gave me my senses. He gave me my pride. But my eye must betray what it sees through the light. I beg you to stay. I will give you a name. A name you can remember me by. Should your crown drop into my lap I should want to rise And float to other shores Where our paths shall cross again And none shall ask me what the answer can be I could tell you But the secret fears me By this enchantment power is gained power to lose oneself And let yourself be guided To the way out. O King, may you lead Let me accompany you O King, may you lead Let me accompany you On this wide beach Take my hand I wish to give you everything That you hold dear A hope and a desire Your glance falls into my tent O King, may you lead Let me accompany you O King, may you lead Let me accompany you On this wide beach Take my hand I wish to give you everything That you hold dear A hope and a desire Your glance falls into my tent Subtitles: tadanobu@KG With the help of stefflbw and adimond
