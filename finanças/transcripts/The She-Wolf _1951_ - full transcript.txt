I don't want any papers, i was just wondering if you are willing to sell the land beyond the windmill? That is not mine, you can ask Mr. Damiris if he wants to sell it to you His father was stingy but a strong man It is a pity That is how it is. . . . sometimes from wolf comes sheep as offspring Why don't you say ferret? Sheep is not suitable for him What about the fact that he takes his students with him to the fields To his fields so . . . . so he gets free labour He says he wants to teach them new methods in agriculture Cheap trick for free labour It is better that they learn more about farming and less math, the teacher is right! You didn't learned neither in your life I have real workers in my fields and i pay them! Hi mr. teacher how are the workers doing? Not workers, Students! Students study grammar mr. teacher This is useful to! You are the teacher, you know, bye now! Bye bye My son doesn't need this Mine is going to be a farmer so it is good for him Come and rest in my shade Did you play today? Yes i did You should know that my father will kill you How do you know that? Aunt Louka told us Yes! Water the flowers, you will need them for your son's grave I will have him killed Maria You always go and sit there sister This is where my little girl used to sit She loved this shadow If you say anything i will talk to Artemi I will die! If i die you will take care of Alex Don't say these things She says she is in a hurry to get married What are you looking at . . .. like an idiot? Are you the groom, you little worm? You heard wrong, i am NOT! Ohh, then i am so sorry, i lost my temper That is more like it Louka, wait, don't go, Louka Go to your mother pathetic coward so the cat ate the blackbird? Yes And did you get sad? Yes very much! Helen come here at once! If you are brave you won't go to her I am not coming Tell her that we are not afraid of her We are not afraid of you! Go now before she decides to slap you. I think i will go to the cafeteria You should have seen your daughter holding the hand with the son of the our father's murder He is her teacher for god's sake Her teacher and best friend ..... ohhhh our father will rise from the grave to seek revenge Ok then, i will do it! So you will be happy for once in your life! Mr. teacher . . . Helen what is wrong? My aunt said that my father will kill you again! It is just talk calm down No, it is happening go inside your house You go first to your home, hurry up! AAAAAAA!!!!!!! The kid fell and hit her leg You can't leave empty handed mr. teacher, here we offer something to visitors You have changed a lot Louka! You think so ? I mean that you don't look like the little girl i knew So you remember? I thought you haven't noticed Cheers I remember this room Then you also remember the faces This one there is our mother And here is our father Do you remember him? Yes. . . . . yes Our houses were used to fighting each other but my old man had a soft spot for you, how can you forget that? He was the one to teach you how to use a gun It is still loaded! He did it himself! What is wrong mr. teacher? You didn't like to play with guns back then But you did! Now you prefer house chores The murderer dared to go inside their home He is not! His father was! It is the same thing! Disgraceful thing! Nothing good comes from fighting? All houses should be allies with eachother She pretended to be angry with him . . . Probably because the teacher is good looking! Is it true that the Damiris family chickened out? People saw the teacher entering their home! And did he walk out alive? I heard it was about the kid He found the opportunity that he was probably looking for a long time Come give it to me aunt Louka don't torture me, my leg hurts help me now with my handkerchief This way your teacher will like you more He is in love with you! What? How do you know that? He is always asking when will you get married Wellcome aunt Taso "Happy" to be here! How come you are here? I hear disgraceful things and you pretend like nothing happened The world knows he was in here! The can call it forgiveness! That is even worse than him dancing on your father's grave! My father had a son with honor, talk to him Shame on you old woman to add fuel to the fire And you should know that Artemis is not going to become a killer, he has a child that needs him If you want revenge get it yourself I might do that! Why didn't you shoot him when you had the gun in your hands? We don't kill inside our home Why don't you confess that you like him? Shut up Bitch Oh lord help us avoid the disaster! Let it rain it is good for the fields I will attend the livestock Please stay my son Don't go! My boy! Where are you my boy? Mother mary help us! Master your mother needs help! You need to leave! No mother i won't leave again, this is my home There is nothing for you here, i fear for you, find life elsewhere, they are wolves I am not a sheep either! *incomprehensible speech* Mother . . . mother . . ♪My sun beautiful and tall.
