- There we go. Get GTE call waiting. Your phone won't be busy and you'll never miss an important call again. Just call 1-800-782-5183. - Very good, very good. - Am I supposed to clean up all this by myself? I thought you guys were gonna help me. - Come on, Sarah, it's the kid's birthday. Let him have a little fun. - You're right, it's his birthday. If you like living in my house, Peter, I expect some help. - You know, one day you're gonna appreciate all the photos I take. - You know, you have an answer for everything. I've gotta go meet my publisher. Don't you have some pictures for me? - You're gonna go see him now? - I'm already late. - 101's Michael Moore starts the runners with the spirit of America 5K-- - So the novel's ready? - Yes. Now I have to see what they have to say. - Well, you shouldn't worry about it. He bought the first one, and this one couldn't be any worse, could it? - Four pack of tickets starting... - And what about your excellent shots? - Well, they're far from excellent, but they're good enough for the back cover. - I mean, the photo's are lousy, but you look like a goddess. - Peter, I... Peter. - Look at that. Your son's a little sneak, that's what he is. - What do you think? Well, hopefully my publisher will like 'em better. - He will. It's just your son who needs a good talking to. - Are you ever gonna grow up? Dennis needs a father, not a brother. - Well, I could be both, you know? - Okay, fine. Just don't tear down the house while I'm gone? - And, and please try to get those sold. I really need to get something sold right now. - Right. - Hey, Dennis. You didn't finish your cake. Come on, I got a special way to eat it. - I suppose you are Peter Mitchell. - Yeah. That's right. - I'm Larry Houghton. I'm an attorney from Century City. I have some very important information for you. Really? Um. Would you like some cake? I inherited what? I know. This is a practical joke. Sarah put you up to it. Yes? You're joking, right? - At $250 an hour, not even the Pope jokes around, young man. - I knew I had relatives in Sweden, but I didn't know this Annie, Annie-- - Holst. Annie Holst. Spinster. Recently deceased. - I've never even heard of a relative with that name. But the house is all mine, kit and caboodle? - And don't get your hopes up too high. It's pretty old and run down and there's not much money. - But it's all mine. - Unless you'd like me to arrange for a sale. - Well, maybe. But I'd like to see it first. My girl needs a vacation. Yeah. That's the ticket. Sweden. - Mr. Mitchell? - Yeah. - My name is Thomas Hansen. The corresponding lawyer for Miss Annie Holst. - Good to meet you. This is Sarah Richards. - Hi. - Hello. I'm sorry, I can't accompany you. I'm afraid that you and my little village will have to make without me for a few days. I've, legal business in Stockholm. But don't worry, I've arranged everything. Here's your key to the rental car. And here's to your place. There. - Mr. Hansen, we've discussed the possibility of selling. - You think we can get a few thousand? - In kroners to dollars? The check, please. - I'll bet it's not the Taj Mahal. - No, you shouldn't have any problems finding the village. I've traced it to your route on the map down there. Any other questions? - Um. No. My navigator will get us there. - Okay, see you. - Thank you, Thomas. Well, do you buy this joint? Well, the hell with that. You can't understand what these Swedes are talkin' about, anyway. - Peter, we should turn right here. - There? No, no, no, we are farther up the road here. - Dennis, what do you think? Left or straight? Left. - Excuse me. I'm looking for a house that belonged to Annie Holst. Are you familiar with her? Annie Holst? Wait. - Maybe they didn't understand you. - Well, they obviously knew her. Jesus. - Here, shut off the car. - All right. Hello. Hi. Yeah. Hi. My name is Peter Mitchell, and, I've got a problem. You see, we're lost and we're trying to find our way. No, um, no. Look, Annie Holst. Are you familiar with that name? - Sir, maybe I could help you. - This map is even lousier than Thomas's. - Well, be glad I was able to find someone who's willing to help us. People here treat us like we got the flu. - How far have we come from the crossroads? - Um. We've come about two kilometers since we made the turn. There should be a building up here on the left. - Yeah, if this is the right road. - Yeah. What the hell is this? - Didn't you fill her up? - Of course I did. Yeah. - Don't worry, Dennis. We're almost there. Maybe it's the starter. Oil compression? - Please! - Okay, I'm just trying to help. - Trust me, I got it under control. Weird psycho car. Did you touch something? - That can't be it. Maybe we should turn around? - No, I think we better go check it out. This is it. Jesus, Sarah. Could you imagine what it's like inside? Come on, say something. It's a castle. It is the Taj Mahal. Bless you, Annie Holst. - It is gorgeous. What do you think, Dennis? - You see, Sarah, he's amazed. - He is not. - Yeah, he is. Hey, Sarah, this could be your work room. If you don't like it, we got 40 more to see. Come on, Dennis, let's go check it out. This place is incredible! Sarah! Sarah, you wouldn't believe this upstairs! It's, it's, it's immense! My God! My God, look at this room! Sarah, you gotta come up and see this. Sarah? This room is mine? I own this place? This incredible mansion? I mean, just a gift from this woman I've never even met before? I own this huge, gigantic house that's just, I'm lord of all I survey! Sarah? Sarah? - I am sorry I scared you. I didn't hear you come in. Besides, in this country we knock before entering a house. - Well, not if you own it. Who are you? - Peter, this is Margareth Johnson. She, she was Annie's housekeeper. - Nice to meet you. I'm Peter Mitchell. - I know who you are, sir. I have tea prepared. - Looks like Dennis has made a friend. - That was Annie's son. Her only child. Dear old Annie. - What was she like? - A dear soul. Giving and loving. Who through her whole life carried a great grief. - Why, what happened? - She loved a man and they had a son out of wedlock. She was left alone to raise her son and times were hard. Then wonderful business opportunities came up, so she had to leave this village for the city and couldn't take her boy with her. So she placed him in a home for children without parents, in an orphanage. Yes. And before she could send for him, he died. Her son and all the other children died from a disease of some kind. To of the end she believed she could actually see him, but she wasn't in complete control of her mind. I'm sorry. Is there anything else? Will you be needing my services any longer? - Of course, Margareth. - Mrs. Johnson, you may come and go as you please. - Thank you. Now, you ought to have some place. Tomorrow I give you the grand tour of the house. Goodnight. And then welcome. - Dennis? Dennis? What's the matter? Come on. Come here. Now don't worry. It was only a dream. Yes, it was. Okay? Hey. - Up here there's really not much to see. Just things that we stuffed away. If all these things could talk I'm sure they could tell some interesting tales. Come here. Look there. That belonged to her son. Nobody has touched it in almost 50 years, I think. She couldn't give it away and she got depressed if she saw it, so it ended up standing here among all these other things. - That's a shame. It's such a gorgeous antique. I could restore it. And you do as you like, ma'am. But I wouldn't touch it. There is too much heart connected with it. And Annie, God rest her, wouldn't want you to. I'm sorry. - Peter, it's okay. I changed my mind. - Whatever you say, dear. - Can't you see him? - No. He went down the road, I think. I'll go get him. - Please find him. Dinner's gonna be ready soon. And Peter? We need to call a plumber. This sink is driving me crazy. Thank you, Mrs. Johnson. I'll finish up. - Yes. - We'll see you after supper. - Yes, ma'am. - Hello? Is anybody here? Dennis? Dennis? Is that you? Boy, he's deaf. God damn it, Dennis. Are you crazy? Your mother would kill you if she knew you were here. Come on. Come on. What? Come on. No more games, Dennis. Let's go. - Have you called someone to fix that? - No, not yet. - You think you can do it? - Me? No way, I'm photographer, not a plumber. Don't worry, I'll get someone to fix it. Are you working tomorrow? - All day, I have rewrites. - Well, that's too bad. I was thinking of taking you and Dennis fishing. - That's sweet. I'll ask him. - Good. I'll call the plumber. - Dennis. Would you like to go fishing tomorrow? - Play with Bill? - Who's Bill? - No, no, it's just an ordinary stopped up sink. No. No, the water won't drain out of the sink. Yeah, exactly. Then you'll be here tomorrow? Yeah, okay. Thank you. Bye. Geez. There'll be a guy named Frank here tomorrow after lunch. - You didn't tell me about Bill. - Bill? Who's Bill? - Dennis says you took him away from Bill when they were playing, and he doesn't want to go fishing tomorrow. He'd rather play with Bill. You didn't tell me he was running around that old house, either. - He's a teenager, Sarah. A Boy Scout. He's curious, adventurous. Don't you remember when you were a boy, Sarah? - Very funny. Dennis, didn't Peter meet Bill? - Well? - Sarah. All right, enough. It's obvious he's created himself a fantasy buddy. - Well, shit, I don't know. He says his friend's name is Bill, fine. But I didn't meet him. - Peter, is Dennis awake yet? - Yeah, he's awake. - Chapter 14. It was one of those days when all she wanted was to be alone. Her husband was in New York and it felt great to have some peace and quiet. She sat there daydreaming and then she looked out the window. She could hear the sound of the branches beating against the window, but she didn't notice the dark shadow that turned up behind her. Aw, yuck. Let's see. Gotta start again. She could hear the branches beating against the window. She had a strange feeling that someone was going to turn up today. Could it be that old high school boyfriend that she knew? - I tried knocking, but nobody heard me. I'm Frank. What's the problem? - Yo, Bill! Come out! Wherever you are. It's your friend Dennis and his friend Peter. Hello? Is anybody-- - Hello, Peter. - Thomas! - Dennis. - Good to see you again. - Still planning to sell the old house? - Old, my ass. That was some heavy duty surprise shit. I still can't believe it. I'd like to find Annie Holst and bless her wherever she is. - She's certainly not in the graveyard. - Graveyard? Where? - Well, it's not really a graveyard, but that's where the kids who had died in the orphanage are buried. - Orphanage? - Yeah. You're standing right in front of it. It was more than 50 years ago. Some stories say the children in their madness threw themselves from up there down here. I don't know. I'm only a country lawyer. But if you're really interested, you should talk to old Charles. He was the administrator of the place back then. Come on, I'll show you the graveyard I told you about. You're gonna find some very fascinating photos to take there. - Come on, let's go. - What's wrong? - All right, you can stay here, but-- - They buried the children here. In fact, Annie Holst's son is here somewhere. - Well, where is he buried? Didn't they mark his grave? - No, they didn't mark any of them. So, they didn't know where to find Bill. - What did you say his name was? - Bill. Annie's boy. He too died over there. - Wait a minute. Annie's son's name is Bill? - Did you say 350? - Um, I'm sorry, I didn't think it would cost so much. I have 250 I can pay you now and the rest later when Peter gets back. Look, Peter's gonna be back here any second. We can go outside. - What's wrong? - This may sound crazy, but Dennis's friend, his name is Bill. I don't know, maybe I'm, I don't know what I'm talking about here. God damn it, Dennis. I told you not to go inside. Now I don't mind you exploring, but if anything happens to you. Go. - You don't have to pay with money. - What exactly do you mean by that? - Don't you dare. - Hey, Peter. What the hell is Frank doing here? - Well, we had a problem with the plumbing in the kitchen. Sarah, put down the gun. - Don't do anything stupid, Peter. Unfortunately, the police can't be here for a few hours. - Why the hell not? There is a lunatic running around out here! - Easy, Peter. Come on, this isn't the Hollywood precinct. We're in the country. Thomas, there must be something we can do. The guy is probably halfway to Stockholm by now. - Well, he usually works for old Charles. Maybe he knows something. - Dennis! - Sarah! - Don't worry. I'll deal with him. - I've met him before. - What? - At the bar in the village. He showed us the rest of the way to the estate, but he sure as hell didn't meet Dennis. I can't understand why Dennis... - I didn't you realize you and Peter had met. - Well, that was just for a few minutes. Did my map help you, Peter? - Yes, it did, but unfortunately I'm not here to talk about maps. We're looking for Frank. - No. What did he do now? - Well, I believe it's a matter for the police. Have you seen him? - Not since yesterday. If he did a bad thing, you must forgive him. He's still a child. - A child? Well, that's one way to put it. - Dennis, I am trying to understand. You don't make any sense. Charles. That man back there. Killed the children? God, what is happening to you? - Yes, Peter, I'm sorry to hear about all this, but um, I personally talk to him. And the police, of course. So we'll get this thing taken care of. - Yeah, well you better, 'cause if I find the son of a bitch-- - I don't know what I'll do. - Don't worry, young man. - I'm sure you noticed Dennis's reaction outside. You haven't met him by any chance, have you? - I'm afraid not. Where shall I have met him, do you mean? - How about your old orphanage? He's been very interested in playing around there. He seems to have made a friend with a kid named Bill. - Orphanage? I'm afraid I don't know anything about the orphanage. - I don't understand. You were the county administrator. You must know something. - Listen, young man. I'm old. I don't remember much from those days. And I think you should keep your boy out of there. It's not a good place for children playing. Not anymore. - I just realized we couldn't get any further with that old man. - Yeah, another charming sleazebag. What's going on, Thomas? - It seems probable that there's still some kind of records about the orphanage. I could make some inquiries if you're interested. - Please. - Frank? Frank! - I'm sorry to trouble you at home, but this is important. - Isn't Thomas Hansen taking care of things for you, Peter? - No, no, he's been fine. He's been very helpful, as a matter of fact. - Then what are you calling me for? - Well, aside from Thomas and Margareth, it seems that, well, everyone in the village thinks we're crazy for living here. - Peter, that makes sense, since you're related to Annie Holst. Thomas told me that she thought her dead son was alive in that old orphanage, right? - Which brings me to my second point. It seems that Dennis has met Bill, also. And he apparently is obsessed with the orphanage and whatever is in there. - Dennis has been listening to Thomas's stories. He's fantasizing. - For god's sakes, Dennis is deaf. - Listen, if this is all so important to you, why don't you just sell the place? You wouldn't object to making a lot of money, now would you? - I've had it, Peter. Let's go home. - Yeah, you're right. Maybe it is time. But there's something-- - But what? I was almost raped! My son has horrible nightmares. He has some fantasy friend named Bill. Who the hell's Bill? Dennis. Who's Bill? Great. Now he's a photograph. - I'm sorry, Dennis. But it's tough to believe in something you just can't see. Jesus Christ. Sarah? Sarah, come here! - What is it? - I think you'll want to see this. Dennis was alone when I shot this. - Cute. Real cute photographer's trick. - I didn't touch the negatives, Sarah. - You expect me to believe that? - For god's sake, Sarah, I checked the negative. He only showed up when I developed the print. - Is this your friend Bill? That's it, we're leaving. - Wait a minute. Dennis has got a problem here. We can't just leave. - Wanna bet? Come on. What do you mean no? I'm your mother! - What did he say? - He has to help his friend Bill and the children. - Hello, Peter. Thomas here. Yeah, I've got something of interest. Seems old Charles was skimming public money and then for the orphanage children. Yeah. No, just wait there. I'll be right over. Of course, bye-bye. - I knew Thomas would get something. - Thomas called. Sarah, he says he has some very interesting information about Charles and the orphanage. - Well, he can stick it. - Sarah, he's on his way here. - Goodnight, Dennis. - Come on, let's get a drink. - Okay. - It's been over two hours. He should be here by now. - I'm gonna go to bed. - Hey, he's here. - Mr. Mitchell. I had to come to see you. I must tell you that-- - Come in, Margareth. - I, I never, never heard about something like this. - Thomas is dead? - God, what happened? - They think Frank did it. - Where are you going? - To check on Dennis. Peter! Where could he be? - Now look, look, I didn't tell you this, but one morning I woke up and he was wiping mud off the floor, and I'm sure that he was walking through the swamp-- - What does that have to do with it? - Because between the orphanage and the cemetery there is a swamp and I'm sure he was in there. Maybe he's in the graveyard. - Where are you? Where are you? - There's a swamp between the, between the orphanage and the cemetery. - I can't take this anymore! - Well, just shut up! - I'm going crazy! Just find him! - I'm going as fast as I can. - Just listen to me. Maybe I should drive. I've been putting up with you for two weeks. I've had it with you. Peter, I'm just scared, okay? - So am I. We'll find him. Come on, trust me. We'll find him. - Dennis! Dennis! Here. Thank God. Peter. I want to go home. - Whatever you say, dear.
