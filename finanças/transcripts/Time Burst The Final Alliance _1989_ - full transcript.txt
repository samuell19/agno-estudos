You're crazy! Tell me where the Master is. Fly the plane! Fly the goddamn plane! Tell me. Tell you what? Who are you? Very funny, Urbane. Urbane-- that's what the guy in the diner called me. Whew. License plate checked out. It's definitely Jane English. I think Urbane's trying to double-cross us, Chief. Christ. She's never going to give up, is she? All right, put somebody on both their apartments. I want Urbane back. So, Urbane not only didn't acknowledge you, he pulled a gun? - Yes. No. No. Yes. Yes. Yes.

No, you're wrong. He's a professional. [music playing] What happened with Rush? What's the gun for? Emergencies. What's your name? Where are you taking me? Shut up, Urbane.

The pigeons have returned to the coop. Over. AGENT (ON RADIO): Stay put. We'll be right over. [sighing] [mystical music playing] [fire crackling] Why did that samurai try to kill me? We're in the lawless times of [inaudible],, warrior monks. [inaudible] rose and fought the shogun. The symbol was the same as pendant you wear. They killed Many took much land. In the end, they were destroyed. I am the last one. The samurai fear that I might yet raise an army from the dead. What do you know about immortality? There are many things I could teach you if you are strong enough and not afraid. But certain things cannot be rushed. You can trust me. No man can be trusted, else he's not a man. You have given me no reason to stay here and be insulted by you. [inaudible] You may not be trustworthy, but at least you will see. To start, you will address me as your master, sensei. Do you understand? Yes, sensei. Close your eyes. Being a samurai is choosing that with the pursuit of that, you will be one with the Bushido. Being one with the Bushido, you will be able to perform to the best of your ability-- separated and above the world of daily life. [water running] Can I help you? Thought you might need this. What'd you wash your dog with it? Look, I'm going to take a walk. I need to think. Sure you're not going flying again? Just some fresh air. [music playing] I gotta get some rest. Yeah, good idea. Bye. Hey! [gunfire] What the hell are you doing? I;m not going to let you kill me. You're the one with the gun. What the hell are you doing sneaking around? What are you doing sneaking up on me? [sighing] You want to tell me what is going on here? Nice sword. Drop it. Drop the gun. [tires squealing] Come on. You just wanted to blow my brains out. Look, either they shoot you or I do. Which do you prefer? I don't know. How's your aim? Pigeons have flown the coop. I thought you were watching the place. They must be hiding inside. Wait here. The rest of you come with me. URBANE: Very nice. JANE ENGLISH: Thank you. This car doesn't work. You We try the key first? - Oh, shit. - What? I can't drive. (INCREDULOUSLY) What? I forgot how. - Get out of the seat! - No. (ANGRILY) Move! Show me how. (ANGRILY) Move over! No. (SHOUTING) Put the key in and turn it! Urbane! [gunfire] [tires squealing] Get 'em! URBANE: Stop the car. (URGENTLY) Stop the car! What now? Check that out. (SARCASTICALLY) My god, it's a library. Then I remember that building. Let's go inside. What are we doing here? Why don't you trust me? Why should You've been playing games with me. No, I'm telling you, I don't remember anything. Only the plane crash. Then you really don't remember who I am? I'm not sure. It comes back in pieces. You probably bumped your head in the crash. You must have amnesia. It's strange. I remember this old Japanese man and being attacked by a samurai. Does that make any sense to you? Not really. Where do you fit into all this? I work with you. Well actually, I work for the Agency. Or, used to. Uh-huh. Tell me more. You were contracted by the Agency. You were supposed to get some information from that passenger on that plane. This man on the plane, who is he? Morgan Rush. Ah, he's a world known antiquities dealer. We've arranged for you to replace Rush's regular pilot. Just get him to give you what we need. What exactly do you need? Rush has acquired some ancient Japanese tablets of great value to a certain interested party. He gave them to a man, code name The Master. The Master? Uh-huh. Uh Rush should be able to tell you where The Master's hiding. Who's the interested party? Oh, I'm sure you'll meet him. I hate it when you're vague. Usually means I;ll be up to my neck in shit. [chuckling] That's why you love me. Oh, you remember Jane English, don't you? Yeah, your assistant. Yes. She stole a copy of your file. I think she's trying to stick it to us. So she knows as much as we do? Uh-huh. We'll need to get rid of her. OK. OK, I'll arrange for a meeting out at the airfield tonight, then I'll eliminate her. Urbane? Urbane? [rapid footsteps] Jesus Christ, you scared me! I'm sorry. What's wrong? Urbane! URBANE: Shh, shh. JANE ENGLISH: [gasping] I'm not going to kill you. Oh, I remember now that I'm supposed to, I'm not a killer. But you've got to promise to trust me, all right? All right? OK. I know you betrayed the Agency. What are you trying to get out of this? The tablets Mueller's after are worth a lot of money. So you wanted it for yourself? Yeah, why should that reptile keep everything for himself? Aren't you guys supposed to people working for the government? We work for the highest bidder. [sighing] Well, now this whole mission has gone berserk and they want to kill us both. We have to find The Master. He's our only way out. What leads have we got? Freddie Delago. He's in on this. He'd know where The Master is. Shall we? (SCOFFING) I'm in your hands. Well, I'm the only one you got. Come on, let's make a phone call. [telephone dialing] [telephone ringing] FREDDIE DELAGO (ON TELEPHONE): Hello? JANE ENGLISH (ON TELEPHONE): Freddie, this is Jane English. Be there on time, Freddie. (VIA LISTENING DEVICE) He said he'll meet us tomorrow. URBANE (VIA LISTENING DEVICE): Where? JANE ENGLISH (VIA LISTENING DEVICE): McGill's Road, 11 AM. URBANE (VIA LISTENING DEVICE): Good. You hungry? They're meeting with Delago in the morning. You capture and eliminate Delago, huh? That will be no problem. But you still haven't told me what's so important about these tablets. They contain certain information that's crucial to our future. And in The Master's hands, they pose a great threat to us. Oh. So who is this Master? A long-time enemy. Just find him. That's what you're getting paid for-- not to ask questions. [telephone ringing] [crowd noise] [non-english speech] [inaudible]? No, thanks. Have you had many relationships? What, with women? You obviously have wonderful relationship with yourself. I don't remember any. You asked me out once. No way. What do you mean? How can I be with a woman who's trying to kill me? Could turn into an exciting evening. Was it? We didn't go. I said no. Why? You were so close with Mueller, I thought you were a jerk like him. Well, now that you know what a wonderful guy I am, how about giving me a second chance? I'll think about it. Right now, we have a date with Delago. He's not here. No. We'll wait. So, am I different now? I it was I a bad person? I've known worse. What if I-- what if I don't get all the old me back? You're much better now, anyway. Really, what if I develop into this wonderful, compassionate person, then find out I have to break people's necks for a living. You do. I think you're overreacting. Everyone's afraid of the unknown. Yeah, yeah, but who wants to be afraid of themselves? It's him. Hold on, you can't go out there alone. The deal was, I talk to him. No, you can't do this. We're partners. Then trust me. Who's your friend? My chauffeur. Hey, you said alone. I meant you. Hey, still don't trust me? No. Don't forget, can always get Mueller to finish you off. Yeah? You're still a scary old broad. Shut Freddie. [engine noise] You owe me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't remind me. OK, so what do you want? Where can I find the guy code named The Master? (SCOFFING) You don't want to fuck with the Japanese. So you know who he is? Yeah. The guy you want just happens to be in town right now. But I figured you knew that. Must have slept through it. Stop stalling. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so come on. Just want to make sure you're not wired eh? You're paranoid. Hey, it's what's kept me alive. [gunfire] Oh! [gunfire] Who is he? (WEAKLY)The Master. Come on. What are you going to do with that thing, deflect Would you leave him? He's dead. Day [gunfire] Somebody told them we'd be here. You stay here. [gunfire] Drop the gun. Drop the gun. - [panting] - Oh, Urbane. Don't make me do it. [gunfire] Urbane! Well, get his body on the van. [mystical music playing] [grunting] [shouting] Where is The Master? Gone. Where? Away. Get him! [grunting] [shouting] [clanking] [shouting] [grunting] [clanking] [grunting] Give it up. [inaudible] [inaudible]! Where is the old man? May he rot in hell. [grunting] [shouting] Kill him! He--he's not human. He bleeds like any man. [grunting] Iko! God, it works. I cannot die. So, you have discovered my secret? Or should I say, stole? The knowledge contained in these tablets was not for you or any other mortal man. It was to die with me. You know that. You are no longer a student of mine. I leave you nothing but your guilt. Your soul is weak. Time will never heal you have done. I hope you can survive eternity with it. Sensei, wait. Sensei, wait! I cannot die. You hungry? What do you want from me? I'll do anything you want if you let me go. Well, we'll have to see about that, huh? Tell me what Urbane told you. What exactly do you want to know? Tell me what Rush told Urbane before the crash. Didn't tell him anything. Don't lie to me. Urbane had a special talent for, uh, extracting information from people. Ha. Probably his charming nature. Yeah. So what did he tell you? Think I'll have that sandwich now. Urbane threatened to kill me. I didn't help him. He had no intentions of turning Rush's information over to you. I think he was going to sell them. Not a bad huh? That explains Urbane's behavior in the diner. But unfortunately, the only person who can verify your story was Urbane. Then I guess you're going to have to trust me. You help me, I'll help you. I need more. After all, what's to keep you from killing me after I tell you? Nothing. I know where The Master is. You're going to need me to get to him. I want you to take me to your boss. I'm taking you to the tsunami right now. Is he the interested party? Yes. [grunt] Well, get her! Why do you insist on playing these stupid little games, Jane? Huh? Have you forgotten how nasty I can get? I'd have to see why [inaudible] like Urbane. You still hold the ace, Mueller. Well, let's see how well you play. Get his body to the morgue, and then get back here. AGENT: Where should we leave them? MAN: Oh, anywhere. Got an ID for them? AGENT: Only for this one. MAN: OK, John Doe 21 for the other. [gasping] Hi. [weeping] Shit. [weeping] [grunting] Of course, we'll need you to verify his identity. [panting] Merely as a preliminary detail. We have 20 bodies here now. [weeping] Let's see, what was the name again? Delago, Frederick. [weeping] I'm not sure what bag Mr. Delago is in. I'm sorry. Seems my assistant has disappeared. He probably went out for a bite. [weeping] To eat. Oh, there, there now, Mrs. Delago. Why don't we just take a peek and see if we can't find huh? [weeping] [humming] Ah, here he is, they brought him in this morning. [weeping] That's strange. [humming] Uh, that's not him. Just as I was saying, they brought him in this morning with Mr. Delago. Ha, here he is, John Doe 21. [weeping] Freddie, Freddie, oh, Freddie, why? Why? Why, Freddie? Give them some time alone, hm? [weeping] [screaming] What happened? Visiting hours are now over, Mrs. Delago. If you'll just sign this verification we'll go look for your friend, hm? MRS. DELAGO: [whimpering] Wanna play? [grunt] Gentlemen. Leave me. Is there something you want to tell me? Jane English, meet Takeda Sanarma, owner of Sanarma Enterprise. I will make this Miss English. I understand you have something we need. I'd prefer not to have to force you into volunteering that information, but your cooperation is necessary one way or another. One million dollars cash. [chuckling] [chuckling] [grunting] The information in exchange for your life. Surely that is worth more than the money to you. And what's to keep you from killing me afterwards? You have my word. My honor. My trust in that you'll remain silent. I have no reason to kill you. There are far more important things at stake here. I'll think about it. [whispering] You have one hour. [door closing] Whoa. [grunting] [beeping] [whirring] All right, come out of there. Come out or I'll shoot. ROBOT TOY: Hello, space commander. Take me to your leader. You? At your service. But-- [grunting] [grunting] [groaning] I had a dream, Urbane. Urbane? Urbane, you're alive! Urbane? Ow! What was that for? Don't be so impulsive. You seemed to like it. I did. That's the problem. Come on, let's get out of here. But the bullets, the blood? I'll explain later. You were wearing a bulletproof weren't you? No, he was a bad shot. Look, I don't want to get into it right now. I want to know. I saw the blood. He hit you. No, it was a scratch. Urbane, your rib cage was hanging out. Tough genes, I guess. How do you expect me to trust you if you won't even tell me the truth? Oh, god, trust? I was in the van. I heard you suck up to Mueller. Me? You were dead. What was I supposed to do? He was ready to kill me. Yeah, and what were you going to do when it came time to confess? I would have told him to kiss my ass. He probably would have. I'd have thought of something. Are you going to tell me why you're still alive? Yeah. I'm immortal. Very funny. You expect me to believe that? How else do you explain my being here? Look, see? Look. I never jumped out of Rush's plane, either. We crashed. He died, I didn't. I can't. I was born 350 years ago in Portsmouth, England. I worked on a Spanish trader ship. We were in Japan, I learned the secret of immortality from an old warrior priest, The Master. That secret is on the tablets that everyone's after. [door opening] You expect anybody to believe that? You're coming with me. [gunfire] Go ahead and shoot me. Shoot me! I already did. [grunting] Oh, god. Don't die. [sobbing] Love you. Really? I wish you would make up your mind. I don't understand. In time, you will. Took me a long time to accept it also. Just one thing-- will you always be jumping in front of guns? I will try to avoid it. What now? Well, we still have to find The Master. He's our only way to resolve this mess. What did Delago tell you? He knew that The Master was in He didn't know where he though. Rush was the only one who knew. If only I could remember. You have to. Concentrate. Look into my eyes, remember the night you were on the plane. You were with Rush. You were flying. I-I can't. You'd better. Otherwise-- We're fucked. Fly the plane. Fly the fucking plane! I know you gave the tablets to The Master. Tell me where he is. Release me first. We're going down about a hundred feet per second. I don't have time to unstrap you. 100, 200, 300. I'll get you for this. He's at a house. 349 Alameda Street. Thank you. Did the Sanarma put you up to this? Oh, shit. [explosion] I remember. He's in a house-- 349 Alameda Street. Let's get out of here. [door closing] [sirens] [sighing] You're not really planning on paying her to talk, are you? That will not be necessary. She will talk. And then we will eliminate her. Yeah? And then what? And then we kill The Master. They've escaped. What do you they? [bang] They. There they are. Urbane, you son of a bitch! Well, after 'em! That's our car. That's OK, chief, I know where they're going. Well, good. Good. Call in the troops. We're going hunting. Come on. I don't understand it. I saw Urbane die. We've known for a long time that a white man stole the Sohi secret of immortality. Must be him. Sohi? Who are they? Warrior monks. The Master was their leader. Was? Yes, 300 years ago. Then how will we be able to kill him now? I'd like to talk to you about that scene at the office. We don't have time to talk. Just keep walking. You didn't want to stop. If I hadn't stopped we'd still be groping at each other. I didn't stop? You didn't. If we had gone through with it-- sex, that is-- are you well, normal? Why? I mean, you don't have any strange body parts, do you? Want to check for yourself? No. Have you had many women? None. None of any great importance. Do you have any children? I don't know. Never tried. Maybe I was just lucky. Odds must have been pretty great for you not to have. Look, I've never shared my life with anyone before. You're sure you're built like a human? Yeah, I have two eyes, two hands, two balls if that's what you're talking about. I am a normal man with a gift. It took me about a hundred years to stop being paranoid about who I am. Physically I'm 28 years old, but I have been around for 350 years and I'm still all alone. Think that's fun? That's it. You going in? Yes. You wait here. I'll bring him out. If anyone comes, you lay low. [scream] [grunting] Where's The Master? Where is he? [shouting] Come on. [grunting] Sensei? Michael Urbane. I am Takeda Sanarma. Where's The Master? I was hoping you could tell me. Leave it. We have Miss English. That's impossible. I left her by-- By the ridge. I know. I've got her. And now I've got you. What do you want? A test. Raise his shirt. The wound is gone. Hold out his arm. This weapon was was designed by our space program. It contains a radioactive alloy that can destroy anything-- including an immortal. [grunting] Stop! If you value the girl's life, you will cooperate. [buzzing] [whimpering] [panting] Stand him up. Enough of these games. It's time to play for real. Sanarma will have their revenge. [shouting] [gunfire] [sighing] Ho, ho-- [shout] [groaning] [panting] Catch him! [wind chimes] (BREATHILY) Where am I? You're safe. Lie still. They told me they had you prisoner. [mystical music playing] Sensei. You are no student of mine. I betrayed you once. I have come to repay that debt. Repay me by bringing these men here? No, by helping you out of here. The Sanarma have a weapon-- a weapon that will kill even you and me. Somebody lost this war 300 years ago, why fight it again? We have the tablets. Call the authorities. We can leave. There's no reason to die. We fight for honor. As long as the Sanarma live, the battle goes on. There is only one winner. Sensei. [inaudible]. I have 12 men left. The Sanarma have us surrounded. We will fight to the death, but I'm afraid I can offer you no avenue of escape. Hold them off as long as possible. There is something I have to do. I will join you shortly. [speaking japanese] He will be fighting with us. Wait here. No. I will come with you. We'll come with you. Life used to be simpler. [gunfire] [grunt] What? Come on. Whoa. [inaudible] [gunfire] [grunt] [gunfire] You OK? [gunfire] [grunt] [shouting] OX (ON RADIO): This is Ox. The north room is all clear. This place is a fucking maze. I got two on the run. There's a hallway leading north. Should I proceed? Over. Proceed with caution, Ox. We've lost too many men already. OX (ON RADIO): Roger. Over and out. Have all outposts on the perimeter reported yet? Yes, sir. Urbane, let's just get the hell out of here. I won't leave him. Forget The Master. I'm more worried about us. Look, if you're afraid, leave. I've got a debt to repay. In case you haven't I'm not immortal like everyone else around here. Yeah, well they have a weapon that'll kill even me. Look, for the first time, my life's at stake, too. Let's finish this together. OK. [gunfire] [grunting] Give it up. All the Master's men are dead. You can't stop a Sanarma. I would rather die on my feet. [gunfire] Jane! [explosion] Jane? Jane? Urbane, this way. These steps will take you two levels down. That is where The Master is. Do you understand? Yes. And you? I'll hold them off as long as I can. Tell Sensei it has been an honor to serve him. [inaudible] May our paths cross again. [gunfire] [grunting] All agents report. AGENT (ON RADIO): One and two reporting. Freeze! Drop the sword. I said drop it. He's not listening, Leo. Snuff him. Forget it pal. Nobody's that fast. [grunting] [grunting] We lost agents one and two. You stay here. This way. One and two, do you copy? These tablets will not fall into the Sanarmas' hands. [inaudible] dead. So they're mortals. I have lost again. We can still escape. I owe you that. You will die today, my friend. We can try fight our way out. Do you think after 300 years, that Sanarma will give up if we escape? I am tired of running. If they haven't given up, why should we? Our time has run out. We have used the gift, now it is time to give it back. Think of all the things you have seen and done. No one can take that away from you. The past is all anyone ever has. All the else is transitory. A final lesson. I wish I could share my past with you. I was going to tell Jane, but-- She meant something to huh? I would gladly have become mortal to spend the rest of my life with her. Love is rash. Damn this waiting. I say we face them on our feet. Not only love rash. So are you. Patience is a virtue I can live without. There is a passage out of this room. Well, let's go, then. I have no wish to go. Well, if you stay, they're going to kill you. I will not let them. I want to die on my own, with your help. You're crazy. Is it? You yourself said you wanted to be mortal, meaning you wish to die. I would like that now. But there's no blade that can kill us. Not a blade-- a soul-- an immortal soul. You remember the samurai, Akira? Uh-huh. I faced his father in single combat during the final battle. We were both in possession of the secret. We were invincible. We fought long and hard. Finally, he charge, but I was quicker. I cut off his head and he die. You want me to chop your head off? - A simple thrust will do. - I will not. Help me and you can escape. Stay and you die. Then I will die. Kill me also. JANE ENGLISH: Urbane? Jane! Thank God I found hat Thank God you're still alive. That explosion knocked me out. I've been running his place This place is crawling with men. I thought you'd gone. [clearing throat] Ah. We were just discussing that. Would you please pat the statue of Buddha three times on the head? [mystical music playing] [creaking] Way out? - You wait in the tunnel. - Why? Just do it. You have everything you need. I can't love a woman and watch her get old while I stay forever young. What was done can be undone. The tablets told you how. You probably did not read that far in your haste. Kill me and the secret immortality shall be yours. All right. There is one thing you should know. Once you have become mortal again, there is no going back. One life is all a man needs. [speaking japanese] May our paths cross again. Call me brother. Until then, brother. I am ready. [grunting] [shouting] [groaning] [speaking japanese] Bring the body. We'll burn it outside. Is it scary being mortal? I never really thought about it before I met you. Everybody dies, Urbane. Well, I guess if we're careful, we should have about 40 or 50 years left together. Is that a proposal? [music playing] [chuckling] [music playing] [music playing]
