And there were many men who went to Canada because they believed that it was immoral. I think that I like those men who went to Vietnam 'cause they believed, and those men who went to Canada because they believed. (speaking French) (man speaks French) I knew I was, I was right in what I was doing. I think all the deserters did. That might not have been in the forefront of our mind, exactly what it was-- principles like Nuremberg. But after hearing about the war or, in my case, after seeing it, I knew what I was doing was correct. Most of these things are not done by monsters. They're done by very ordinary people, people very much like you and me. These things are results of pressures and circumstances to which human frailty succumbs, and a large part of it isn't really due to any intrinsic sadism or desire to inflict pain. It's... It's the degeneration of standards under pressures-- boredom, fear, other influences of this kind. Well, I guess that I did think before that, uh, that Americans in their history had been somewhat more immune to these pressures and that the historical record was a better one and the moral standards we tried to attain in peace and war were higher. I guess I still think we try to attain the higher values. But, uh, yes-- Ophuls: And succeeded sometimes. And succeed sometimes. Succeed less often, I guess, than I thought before. I didn't want to see the museum at Dachau. Ophuls: Why not? I had, uh... I guess some of it's from my father.

Gilbert (clears throat): Of course, as you know, the Germans are very rank-conscious. Ophuls: Yes. And, uh, that, as a matter of fact, proved handy because I was able to administer IQ tests simply by telling them, "I have orders. You will now take an IQ test," and they sat down very meekly and took IQ tests. If I simply said that, "I'm a psychologist, and I'd like to know how intelligent you war criminals are," I obviously wouldn't have gotten anywhere. When the trial started, if you recall the grim picture of the Nazi war criminals in the prisoners' dock, and they were leaning into each other and and mumbling something. What they were talking about was, "What did you get on that professor's IQ test?" Uh, "How many digits did you remember?" "I got eight forward and six backwards." And this is what they were arguing about at the beginning of the war crimes trial. (Kempner speaking German) (Ophuls speaks German) Marshal: Attention! The Tribunal will now enter.

Sidney Alderman: Hermann Wilhelm Goering, Rudolf Hess... Goering, who as you might expect, was quite cynical about it, wrote... (speaking German) Uh, Rudolf Hess, as you recall, had this problem of amnesia. And all he wrote was, "I can't remember." He wrote that in English. Alderman: Joachim von Ribbentrop... Gilbert: Ribbentrop wrote that, "The indictment is directed against the wrong people." And what he meant by that was that Hitler should have been indicted, but he didn't dare put that down in writing, because heaven knows where Hitler was, and he was still afraid of him. You had Doenitz, who was, uh, Hitler's final successor as fuhrer for the last few days of the Nazi Reich, uh, wrote... (Gilbert reading out loud German) "Typical American humor. Karl Doenitz."

The women are able to smile for the first time in years. Ophuls: Dr. Gilbert, after the showing of the concentration camp film in the Tribunal, you went to their cells the same evening. Yes. It was surprising in that the reactions went from one end of the spectrum, from apparent indifference, to the most violent kind of, uh, guilt-laden self-recrimination. Doenitz was extremely indignant. He, he thought it was a crime to expose him to witnessing the film, even, because he as a naval officer had nothing to do with atrocities.

Uh, but no, this, uh, this is really, uh, utter rubbish. Frank Wallis: The Nazi conspirators adopted and publicized a program of ruthless persecution of Jews. We have no accurate estimate of how many persons died in these concentration camps, and perhaps none can ever be made. The Nazi conspirators were generally meticulous record keepers, but the records which they kept about concentration camps appear to have been quite incomplete. Perhaps the character of the records resulted from the indifference, uh, which the Nazis felt for the lives of their victims. But occasionally, we find a death book or a set of index cards. For the most part, the victims faded into an unrecorded death. Ophuls: Regine, have the children seen the film? How old do you have to be to see the film, the concentration camp? Forty-five.

(Ophuls speaks German) (continues in German) (speaking French) (speaking German) (Ophuls speaking) (speaking French) So, my initial connection with Nuremberg really began because I was ordered to become part of the prosecution team. I was in the Army. I was given orders to report to it. And my initial connection with it was not really governed by any principled approach to this at all. Far wider are the duties which we must fulfill here. These larger obligations run to the peoples and races on whom the scourge of these crimes was laid. For them, it is far more important that these incredible events be established by clear and public proof, so that no one can ever doubt that they were fact and not fable. After all, I was not in a high position at that time. The ones who were responsible for thinking it out and... uh, providing the motivation for Nuremberg, yes, I think they were governed by this desire to, to articulate these principles, to put them into application, and to do it on a basis that they would be willing to see applied to ourselves as well. Although my initial connection with Nuremberg was, uh, was as I say... a matter of response to orders, I then did become interested in it. I invested nearly four years, uh, of my life after the war... in continuing to conduct the trials and was responsible for the trials that came after the first one. I had signed indictments against individuals accusing them of, uh, crimes under the laws of war. Uh, men had been hanged and imprisoned as a result of charges that I had brought. (speaking German) (Ophuls speaking German) (speaking German) (speaking German) (speaking German) Beals: Karl Brandt, Military Tribunal One has found and adjudged you guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity as charged under the indictment heretofore filed against you. Military Tribunal One sentences you, Karl Brandt, to death by hanging. And may God have mercy upon your soul. The officer of the guard will remove the defendant Brandt. Ophuls: How do you feel about capital punishment? Taylor: If you're asking about capital punishment in the United States, I'm among its opponents, because it has come to be applied in a... in a irrational way. I don't believe that I am completely opposed to capital punishment, however, if one assumes that it is in a measured and rational application. (trapdoor clatters) How could I be? Uh, if I had been opposed to capital punishment, I, uh, I would not have, uh, been involved with Nuremberg. Ophuls: Well, you could've changed. I mean, you could've been in favor then and... "I could have changed." ...in opposition now. I don't believe so. I don't think I've changed in that respect. (Rose speaking German) (speaking German) Ja. The ability to, to live with quite contradictory notions in one's mind, such as that we are working to preserve democracy and freedom, uh, with our ally in, uh, South Vietnam, knowing quite consciously, on the other hand, that we have a corrupt dictator, that we have installed, and who is imprisoning and torturing thousands of people. The ability to hold those two thoughts in your mind, uh, not to question either of them, not to confront them and not to draw any logical implications, especially from the latter, the facts of what we're actually doing, uh, that's an ability which is essential in an official. And we all had it. I had it. My bosses had it. Rose (speaking English): Nixon and the American people have made enormous sacrifices for the interests of their allies. And I am conscious of the fact that the existence of my state Germany, and myself and my family, depends on the United States, which maintains peace and order among minor nations who are guilty of misdemeanor. Ophuls: Isn't it a little paradoxical that you should take that stand? Because, after all, you were prosecuted by this American power. Well, uh, that only could prove that, uh, I am a man who is not, uh, determined by prejudices. Beals: Military Tribunal One sentences you, Gerhard Rose, to imprisonment for the full term and period of your natural life, to be served at such prison or prisons or other appropriate place of confinement as shall be determined by competent authorities.

And therefore, the whole idea of... of imposing a guilt feeling on this is very repugnant to them. I think one of the reasons why the Anne Frank movie was so popular was because you never see any Germans in it. You hear them come up the stairs, you never see anybody. And so the German people could get a feeling of, "Ah, yes, it was all terrible," but nothing is ever brought home to them, as an individual about it. Oh.

Um, just before the show was put on television, the producer and the director were asked to eliminate all reference to gas. Well, they refused, quite rightly, but when the show was put on television, the control, uh, switch was pulled every time gas was mentioned, so the word "gas" is never heard. Ophuls: Blipped out. Uh, blipped out, yes. The reason was that, uh, one of the sponsors of the show was Pacific Gas and Electric, uh, which didn't like the idea of having gas mentioned in this unfriendly way.

"Nearly all had blood running over their shoulders from their heads. "Some of the people shot were still moving. Some were lifting their arms and turning their heads to show that they were still alive." Women and children have died thus, murdered in cold blood! It's understandable, I suppose, that, um, some Germans should resent the Nuremberg process, and understandable, also, that the British and the Allied powers should, um, defend it. What is that old maxim? "My country, right or wrong, but still my country." Now, I'm not trying to justify that ethically, but it is a fact of life that people tend to think in that way. I don't think that the Germans, um, ever realized or... or considered whether these things were moral or not. Ophuls: Yes, but not only were these acts not discouraged under the previous system, they were openly encouraged. I mean, there was a whole ideology that, um, that made what was considered by others immoral into patriotic acts. It's awfully difficult to think that those who took part, for instance, in the, uh, in the establishment and conduct of the concentration camps, and the annihilation of the Jews can ever really have thought, if they thought about it at all, that it was a, a good and a patriotic thing to do.

And then ask themselves, "Are these principles right or wrong?" And if they're right, it doesn't matter a curse who laid them down. (speaking German) (Ophuls speaking German) (speaking German) The murderers are the vanquished. The law makes murder a crime. Society makes it a crime. Ophuls: Of course, a Marxist would also add that the laws on property are the laws of those in power against those who are out of power, who may be the majority, but that's-- Well, I'm not a Marxist, I'm afraid. (Ophuls laughs) You won't induce me to enter into an argument about Marxism. Shawcross: There was quite a big school of thought in Britain, and, um, even more so in the Soviet Union, when they came into the war, in favor of what was called "executive action." Which was that these men should be, um, caught, there should be a very short drumhead court-martial, and they would be executed, um, out of hand in the morning. The Americans were very much opposed to this. Americans, in those days, at any rate, um, had a great belief in the rule of law and injustice. That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury, stay the hand of vengeance, and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason. I think the British, in the earlier days, felt that the thing would not have the appearance of justice, that it might be said that this was a tribunal composed of the victors, that the defendants would not be given a proper opportunity of, um, defending themselves, and that the trial would look rather a bogus affair. I think it was at the, um, Yalta Conference, Stalin said that the proper course would be to arrest 50,000 members of the German general staff, and execute them out of hand. Uh, Roosevelt thought this was a joke, and he said, "Well, perhaps 49,000." But, uh, Winston Churchill took it very seriously, indeed, and he said that he would sooner be taken out into the garden and shot at once, himself, than be a party to such an act of barbarity. May it please the Tribunal. On an occasion to which, um, reference has and will be made, Hitler, the leader of the Nazi conspirators, who are now on trial before you, is reported as having said, "In starting and making a war, not the right is what matters, but victory." Hitherto... everybody had been inclined to feel that if the thing was done in the name of the state, then they who represented the state or who settled the policy would be able to remain in a position of, um, anonymity and escape any individual retribution. These crimes with which we deal are unprecedented, first because of the shocking number of victims. They are even more shocking and unprecedented because of the large number of people who united their efforts to perpetrate them. A thousand little fuhrers dictated. A thousand imitation Goerings strutted. A thousand Streichers stirred up hate. A thousand Kaltenbrunners tortured and killed. A thousand Speers administered.

Uh, I suppose that, having wondered, I didn't pursue the question further. There's no way I could answer it. I mean, I wasn't tested in that way and I don't know. Uh, and, of course, if everybody gave up the attempt to impose principles on conduct because they themselves might yield under pressure, uh, that would not be a very sensible solution to the situation, practically.

Well, you don't do that by cross-examining, um, a hostile witness, and the result was that the cross-examination, um, became extremely ineffective and woolly. (speaks French) Jackson: The difficulty is that the Tribunal loses control of these proceedings if the defendant, in a case of this kind, where we all know, uh, propaganda is one of the purposes of the defendants, is permitted to put his propaganda in, and then we have to meet it afterwards. Lawrence: Surely-- Surely, it's making too much of a, a sentence, which the witness has said, about whether the United States makes its, uh, mobilization orders public or not. Surely, that's not a matter of any very great importance. The defendant ought not to have, uh, referred to the United States, but it is a, a matter which I think you might well ignore.

Colonel Sears stands by as the Nazis are informed that they must see all the horrors at the camp. Ophuls: What was the rationale behind that? Ferencz: Well, it was really so horrible, uh, that it was a form of punishment to even be an observer of it, and, uh... since many of the Germans professed, you know, ignorance of what had happened, this was a means of showing them what had happened, uh, so they would see it, and perhaps be shocked by it. But was this a method of punishment as an act of vengeance or was it more rational? Uh, you know, uh, there wasn't very much reason, uh, in those days. When you come into a camp, uh, you don't react very rationally. You can rationalize it later. Narrator: The day before these Nazis visited the camp, the Burgermeister of Ohrdruf was forced to view the horrors. He and his wife were later found dead in their home, apparently suicides.

So at that stage, one, one had to start thinking about it, if you hadn't already. What is to be said, even against the World War II, and was said by Jews like Milton Mayer, who were, who were, uh, anti-war at that time, was, "This war, whatever can be said for it, will cause us to become monstrous like the monster we are fighting."

Prob-- There are several reasons, but I think the most overwhelming and the central reason is the classical question of the survivor. "Why did I live, while he, she, or they died?" And in Hiroshima, that was a staggering kind of question. They also had a sense of shame, because if you had been a victim of the A-bomb, you had, a lot of times, diseases that were very mysterious, and that, therefore, you wanted to keep it a secret that you had been a victim.

I think I can imagine circumstances in which even I, at these advanced years, would, would, would, would come out again. Uh, it seems to me that, uh, we haven't accomplished anything by that war to end all wars. And even though, at the time of being involved in it, there wasn't any question of believing that we had no alternative... uh, now, I have very serious questions as to what all that loss of life, and all that destruction really accomplished in the world. Ophuls: What was the alternative, Mrs. Ransom? Well, I don't know. Having Hitler take over? No, no. We were unquestioning, and, uh, the, the people that did question were few and far between. By the time that the atom bomb came into play, I was sitting in northern Assam, up above Burma, waiting again to jump into North China, and, uh, I saw a telegram on the bulletin board, and, uh, it reported that the United States had dropped, uh, an atom bomb on Hiroshima, and who knew what that was. Nobody had any concept that this was a war-ender. And if it was a good, big bomb, bully, we were all for it, because we probably then wouldn't have to jump into the north of China. From the day that we got back and started to think about it, I think everybody's had second thoughts, but at the moment, I can't pretend to be in that prestigious group who, who saw immediately, well, what the dire consequences were of the start of the nuclear age. Taylor: I knew a great deal more about Dresden at the time it happened than about Nagasaki and Hiroshima, uh, because, uh, this was thought about and talked about in Air Force circles in advance of the doing, of course. And, uh, I was closely acquainted with a number of British officers who thought that there was no reason for the bombing of Dresden, and advised strongly against it. We had a direct line to all commanders in the field, and, uh, I rang up the American commanding general, General Spaatz, and I said, "I hear you are going to bomb Dresden. Why?" And he said, "Because these panzer divisions are going through Dresden." And I said, "Well, our source shows quite differently. They're going down west of Prague." And he said, "Well, I accept that. If you can show me that they are going nowhere near Dresden, I will not bomb Dresden if the British agree not to bomb Dresden." Then I rang up, tried to speak to Air Marshal Harris, and got his number two, Air Marshal Saundby. I spoke to him and said, uh, "There's nothing there in Dresden to bomb." And he said, "Well, um, that does not make any difference. We are going to bomb Dresden." They had no accommodations for burial, and we would stack these people like cord wood, cover them with lime, and then German squads would come around and burn them, and then, uh, they would say, "Do you see what you've done, uh, to this beautiful city?" Dresden was one of the most beautiful cities I ever saw in my life. Really beautiful. When we were captured, myself and Vonnegut, we were very happy to have been sent to Dresden, because we were told by everyone, including the English, who were at the Stalag Four-B at the time, that it was, uh, an unwritten rule that, uh, Paris wouldn't be touched and neither would Dresden. Ophuls: That's right. That's right. Because they were monuments of civilization. That's correct. And what a monument of civilization it became. Ophuls: But what about Dresden? I don't think it's ever been a maxim of, um, law in any civilized society, that you mustn't punish A, because B has also committed crimes, and you can't get at B. Ophuls: What about when B is, uh, is sitting in judgment? Well, that is, perhaps, unfortunate, but B's crimes were not then an issue. No, as a matter of fact, I'm, in a way, rather in favor of civilians being involved in war. I think the more you involve civilians in war, the less likely you are to have wars. Dresden, Hamburg... these were no doubt, um, terrible incidents, but they were the inevitable consequence of, um, Rotterdam, and London, and Coventry, and Birmingham, and Liverpool, and... In this part of the world, where I lived at that time, not a day passed without, um, German aircraft flying over here, and in this very garden, um, one of our barns, and a large area with farm buildings, was completely destroyed. (playful chatter, laughing, screaming) (carnival music playing) O'Hare: Before the bombing had taken place, I worked in a maltzfabrik, and they made an extract which supposedly was full of vitamins or something for sick people and pregnant women. There was a woman that worked in this maltzfabrik by the name of Mertz, Frau Mertz. She used to slip me a sandwich, not a very good sandwich, but a sandwich, nonetheless, and it was very good. It tasted good to me, uh, about every other day, and she was always " sags nichts ," you know, when they-- when she would slip it to me. Ophuls: What would she say? "Sags nichts." Ah! Yeah, "Don't say anything," you know, and it was very secretive, the way she would slip this, and I'm sure it was at great expense to herself because, as I say, they didn't have much food, either. After the bombing of Dresden, I saw her about three weeks afterwards. Uh, she called me schwein. I said to her, "How are you, Frau Mertz?" She said, " Schwein ," and just walked away. And by the way, her mother was killed in this raid. Uh, she didn't know-- She wasn't in London when it was being bombed. Shawcross: Those who wage aggressive war must contemplate the possibility that they may be beaten, and that they will be beaten by the very methods that they have chosen to use themselves. Ophuls: When you're using "they" and "those..." I am addressing a former prosecutor of Nuremberg... Shawcross: For Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Ophuls: And didn't Nuremberg proceed on the assumption of individual rather than collective responsibility? Shawcross: The individuals who are the leaders of the state have a personal and individual responsibility. The great mass of the citizens must, I'm afraid, accept a collective responsibility for that which governments do in the name of the state to which they belong. ♪ ♪ Narrator: RAF heavy bombers assist Marshal Konev's drive into the Reich. The target is Dresden. It was being used to pump German troops into counterattacks against the Russian army, not many miles to the east. This strike put a stop to that. Static electrical discharge caused by intense cold mars these magnificent bombing shots. (explosions) Narrator: The day after the RAF strike at Dresden, B-17 bombers of the Eighth United States Air Force gave the city a repeat performance. ♪ ♪ Narrator: After these attacks, the German Overseas News agency said, "This city, hitherto almost untouched, is a heap of ruins. It has been smashed to atoms." Ophuls: Suppose the London Charter had not specifically excluded Allied war crimes from the deliberations in Nuremberg, and suppose that, as a consequence of this, Air Marshal Harris had been in the defendant's dock. Would you have accepted to come to Nuremberg and testify about what you knew? Oh, yes, certainly. But I must qualify this. I would have gone to Nuremberg, and I would have had to listen to what the defense said, because there might have been reasons of a military nature about which I knew nothing. But, as far as I knew, it was a crime. Ophuls: And you have no-- And you haven't found anything since, in the 28 years since, which have made you revise that assessment? No. It would have seemed very cynical to punish the Germans for bombing Rotterdam and Belgrade when we were all walking around loose, having bombed Hiroshima and Dresden. Jackson: Even the most warlike of peoples have recognized, in the name of humanity, some limitations on the savagery of warfare. Ophuls: That not even at the time, the restrictions of the London Charter contradict this high idealism that Jackson expressed. I mean, the fact that Allied war crimes were specifically excluded, could not be referred to by defense counsel. Mm-hmm. Sure, (clears throat) these were, uh-- These were very, uh, uh, unfortunate, uh, lapses in the Charter. Ophuls: What about sharing the prosecution with the people, as history seems to have established, who were responsible for the Katyn massacre? It would have seemed to me self-righteous to, uh, refuse to participate in the prosecution with the Russians simply because I knew or suspected or thought that other Russians might, at other times, have been involved in the Katyn massacre. This would not have seemed to me to make sense. With the knowledge we have, um, there's very little doubt that these murders were in fact committed by the Russians. (clears throat) Uh, Justice Jackson strongly urged the Russians to leave it out of the in-- leave the Katyn accusation out of the indictment, because he well knew that this was, uh, a, a very dubious matter. Jackson: ...you bring the subject matter up at that point, Taylor: The Russians insisted on keeping it in. (indistinct chatter) Taylor: The Russians then did introduce evidence to establish that the Germans did it. The German defense counsel introduced evidence, and were allowed to introduce evidence to show that the Russians did it. If that was the true view, the Russians ought to have been in the dock as well as the Germans. (Vaillant-Couturier speaking French) There, um, is no doubt now that they were guilty of these crimes. Ophuls: Of course, there's no doubt now that they were guilty of a great many other crimes at that time, too. No, you see, at that time, I don't think we appreciated, um, sufficiently that that was the case. (speaking German) (Alexander speaks German) (speaking German) (Ophuls speaks German) (speaking in German) Ophuls: And has your discovery about the country you love changed you as an individual? It certainly has helped to do that. And since I read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, I guess it was borne in upon me that these things had happened before. The feeling that I'd had for a long time, that, uh, these things didn't go on in the American armed forces, uh... Alas, it isn't so. They sometimes do. (speaking German) (speaking German) (speaking German) Ophuls: Ja. (Ophuls speaks German) (Speer speaks German) Ophuls: Ah, ja. (Ophuls speaks German) (Speer speaks German) (Ophuls speaks German) (Speer speaks German) (Speer speaks German) (speaking German) (Ophuls speaks German) (Ophuls speaks German) (Ophuls speaks German) Ja. (Ophuls speaks German) Ja, mm-hmm. (speaking French) (speaking German) (Speer speaks German) Ophuls: Ah, ja?

(Speer speaks German) Ophuls: Ja, ja. (Ophuls speaks German) (speaking German) (Ophuls speaks German) (Speer speaks German) Ophuls: Ja. (Ophuls speaking in German) (Speer speaks German) Ophuls: Ja. Ophuls: Ja. (speaking German) (speaking German) (Ophuls speaks German) Taylor: The evidence will show that the defendants knew well the manner in which this labor was being recruited. For these defendants were eager, aggressive, and successful in their efforts to obtain workers from all sources involved in this criminal program. (speaking French) (speaking German) (Kranzbuehler speaking in German) (Serge speaking in French) (speaking German) Taylor: You've mentioned that Dr.Kranzbuehler was doing pretty well out of all this. Oh, well, I can't say that it gives me great pleasure to learn that, uh, that someone who's, uh, uh, been involved, like Flick or someone like that, is, uh, still, uh, very wealthy and living in great luxury, but, uh, I don't think that means that the lesson is totally lost. I agree it does dull the edges a good deal. (speaking German) (Ophuls speaks German) (Ophuls speaks) (Kehrl speaks) (Ophuls speaks) (Kempner speaking German) (Ophuls speaks) Ja. Ja.

(Ophuls speaks) (Speer speaks) Ophuls: Ja. (Ophuls speaks) (chuckling) (Speer speaking German) (Ophuls speaks) Lawrence: Defendant Friedrich Flick... Ferencz: Mr. Flick had been one of the largest contributors to the personal fund of Heinrich Himmler. Himmler had escorted Flick through the concentration camps. Flick had seen the conditions under which the inmates were required to slave in various Flick factories. Those who were the slave laborers, the concentration camp inmates who worked for Flick, uh, most of them are very poor people today, and he who played a leading part in, uh, responsibility for their misery, uh, died, not only the richest man, but completely unrepentant. Lawrence: Defendant Friedrich Flick. How do you plead to this indictment? Guilty or not guilty? (speaking German) Uh, he didn't get a very severe sentence. He got a five-year sentence, and I can't remember exactly how much of it he had served when Mr. McCloy let him out. As is often the case, uh, those who persecute others consider themselves the victim, and he considered himself a victim. (Kehrl speaking in German) Ophuls: Um... (Ophuls speaks German) Perhaps, perhaps he knew more than he has yet told us. He said, "I could have known." Ophuls: Yes. And he is uncompromising in saying that that creates as much responsibility Ophuls: "I should have known." as if I had known. Now, that is a, a thought that can only be frightening to a McNamara. Uh, to, uh, to anyone who continues to excuse himself on the basis of what he did not, in fact, know, because, really, not to know some of these things required a good deal of effort. It required turning aside questions. Uh, it required, um, what Orwell describes very, very analytically in 1984. Uh, "doublethink," he calls it. The ability to stop short of a logical inference from premises that you do hold. The ability not to see the logical, uh, implications of something. To be-- to be stupid. Controlled stupidity. Uh, something that is trained into us, I-- As in Orwell's 1984, but we-- we didn't wait that long for it. Holly Near: ♪ No more genocide ♪ ♪ No, no, no, no ♪ ♪ Now, that's just a lie ♪ ♪ It's one of the many, and we've had plenty ♪ ♪ I don't want more ♪ ♪ Understand ♪ ♪ No more genocide in our name ♪ It is so discrediting to an American audience to raise the possibility that American behavior in the world can be like that of Nazi Germany. That to say it is practically to show that you are a fanatic, extremist, radical anti-American... uh, someone who hates America, and is not to be listened to or learned from. Ellsberg: First things first, there's a lost child here. Uh, Roberta... Reiling? Rebecca Reiling. I was up till three o'clock last night here, reading a bestseller that I got hold of in Washington. Instant history. (crowd applauds) If you look at the taped conversations of the president relating to Watergate, on every other page, we find individuals quite consciously evading knowledge. Guilty knowledge. This is, in fact, of course, political pornography. It is the pornography of power. The fantasy life of men who are stoned out of their minds on secrets and power, outlaw power. One of my points in bringing out the Pentagon Papers, one of my desires, was that, at last, the evidence would be available to give life to the concept of high-level, official crimes of planning aggressive war, war in violation of international agreements or against commitments, and, uh, to reopen the issue. Now, not of the Calley-type crime, the crimes of sergeants and lieutenants, but the crimes of generals and presidents. The crimes of-- against the peace. Assuming that it is so, that this was the reason he decided to publish them, uh, that makes sense to me. That makes sense to me. I don't know Taylor at all well. He is a general and sees himself as such, apparently. I don't think that, uh, his defense here is, is really based on anything decided at Nuremberg. It's based on a feeling that Nuremberg has, uh, has, uh, portrayed to everyone the importance of, of, of following one's conscience to the best of one's ability and standing up against repressive measures. I'm sure that he sees himself as an American having gone, uh, beyond certain earlier barriers and being willing to imagine that American soldiers, like a Calley, might be like German soldiers and subject to the same kinds of laws, and perhaps that even, and this is very far, that a German-- that an American general like Westmoreland could be held accountable, like a Jodl or someone else. He has not gotten to the point where an American civilian official or president-- that he is willing, I'm sure, in his own mind, to imagine could be guilty in the same way that German officials were guilty. There were individuals in high places in the government who saw this as an opportunity for a military conquest, and who were aware of the treaty problems and, nonetheless, went ahead. Uh, but, uh, if you are asking me to say that "X" or "Y" or a "Smith" or a "Jones" is a war criminal-- Ophuls: Or Westmoreland or McNamara. Or anybody you should name. I won't do it. Uh, you can do it, but you wouldn't get an answer. Right. That's what trials are for. That's what trials are for. It's to examine evidence and weigh it. Shawcross: Telford Taylor... Uh, I don't agree with the views that I've heard expressed by him, and I don't think, myself, that there is any parallel between the American intervention in Vietnam, um, at the request of the then government, whatever one may think about the system of democracy that operated then, and German aggression against the rest of Europe. Ophuls: How about the methods of waging war? Oh, the methods of waging war? Well, the methods, of course, were much the same. Ophuls: Napalm... It's absolute nonsense to suppose that one can conduct a major war with, um, rules that you might enforce in a game of football. Wars are fought to be won. One criticism I might make of the Americans in Vietnam is that they never fought that war to win it. They didn't really go all out, and use the whole of the weapons at their disposal. Ophuls: You mean, like, for instance, the atomic bomb? They could have used the atomic bomb, they didn't do that, but I don't think that we can contemplate another war on a world scale in which the atomic bomb is not used. But it would certainly be ironic if an American official goes to jail for illegal entry into a doctor's office and is beyond accountability and punishment for illegal entry into three nations, and illegal entry into this air space of those three nations by B-52's dropping four and a half million tons of bombs. (whistles, cheers) You can raise the moral issues, provided they're abstract. The problem with the war crimes issue is that it relates abstract assertions to concrete individuals, and you can't avoid the inference that if you are saying war crimes have been committed and individuals who act on behalf of the government should be held accountable-- Ophuls: Then who the hell committed them? Right. In Vietnam, my, my, my reactions to going in there were overwhelmingly practical, rather than moral, I'm afraid. Ophuls: Why do you say "I'm afraid"? Well, I suppose that I would have a certain enlarged sense of righteousness if I could say that I had a great moral position against, uh, becoming involved, and ever-involved in war, ever-involved in shooting, ever-involved in killing, and if I'd made the argument in those terms-- I must say, if one made those arg-- the argument in those terms, one would have gotten nowhere, because that would have indicated that you were not in tune with the times. In the Pentagon Papers, you will never find anyone saying, "This is immoral." Or even, "This is illegal." You were only listened to, to the extent that you could develop a valid argument on grounds of national interest or even on military grounds. In weighing pros and cons, to eliminate such considerations, uh, uh, may mean that a, that a totally criminal and immoral consideration, uh, gets very far in the planning process, precisely because, there are no sufficiently practical objections to be made against it. Ophuls: Uh-huh. It's merely murderous. I remember wondering, "Should I resign? Uh, or "Should I stay?" The oldest question. Uh, I didn't resign then. Uh, I was very glad I didn't. I didn't want to have to resign. So, I don't want to-- (sighs) You know, I do-- I, I don't want to, uh, take any credit for myself and blame the others. I am uneasy about, uh, uh, passing judgment on people with whom I was associated, in your phrase, "in the same power structure." Ophuls: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I think you understand why. Uh, the fact is, of course, that no one higher than a lieutenant was tried even for My Lai, and of course, uh, My Lai was comparable to any field-level incident in World War II. Uh, they were not able even to get company commanders and, uh, battalion commanders. Ophuls: Over My Lai, General Koster, Colonel Henderson. They were flying over-- They were all up-- they were all up there, in helicopters, at various levels. Right. But all in radio communication. Every family over there, just about, in those fields, lost a brother, a son, a sister, some way-- to Americans, in some brutal way, and I can understand what I would have become if some army came in here and did this to my family. I, too, would have become a VC. So we created the VC. My, uh, father was a coal miner, and he had a third-grade education, but a very intelligent man, he wa-- you know, he was very swift. We-- There wasn't, uh, the money to buy things, but I think the people who have money to buy things today miss many of the very finest things we had. The radio together, the, uh, walking together, the hills together, uh, being a family. It was a very close family. I had my first, uh, shotgun when I was six. I was good, but I wasn't the best around. I have never seen my father miss with a shot in his life. Ophuls: I see. We took people from the city. Uh-huh. We, we used to guide people. and the rule was that, uh, we never fired until they had fired. If they had missed, then I could shoot... (gunshot) and kill the rabbit, and they got it. We gave it to them, the game. I come from a town of immigrants, really. These people were, were, were very fond of this country, and to prove that they were Americans, the ultimate stamp of approval was you were in the military, you were wearing the uniform of the United States. I don't ever remember a, a word-- an adverse word ever spoken about the military in my hometown, ever. When I had started out with what was wrong in the army, it was at the very lowest levels, and I really could not bring myself to believe that the generals were complicit in it or that corrupt. I felt that it was being done at the colonel level, and at one general, and when the higher-ups knew, that they would correct this, and it may be naive, but this is what happened. When I get to Saigon, I find out now General Abrams is in on it. General Bowers and many other generals, and then I became-- It came to me, "This is only in Vietnam. When I get back to the United States, they will correct this." Then when I get back to the United States, I find out it goes up to Westmoreland, the corruptness. Because, I mean, I-- Ophuls: You mean the cover-up. The knowledge of what had been going on? And the threats, too, you know, the, the actual threats to me, "Shut up or else..." Ophuls: The very specific area of your controversy with the army concerns, uh, Mm-hmm. what has become known as the Valentine's Day Massacre. Okay, uh, on February the 14th, I got a call on the radio from Colonel Franklin, the Brigade Deputy Commander, and he told me that there was a Vietnamese National Police unit coming in, and I would turn prisoners over. They had an American officer with them, a lieutenant. Then the helicopters started landing, and their shooting started, and as I came south into a clearing-- Let's say I come in at, at, at six o'clock. At seven o'clock is standing the lieutenant. They've got these people lined up, and there are four dead laying there bleeding, and they're already dead. They've got the other people lined up right there, except that up at one o'clock, right across, across the circle from me, is a Vietnamese, and he's got this woman-- This is-- It's hard to say the way it is, because he had her pulling her hair back with his left hand, and he had the right hand with the knife all the way around, but not, not across her throat, but all the way around and dug in over here on her neck, and there was one child that was holding onto her clothing, and then they had a second child, was-- Behind him, there was another Vietnamese, had this child's face buried in the sand, and was tramping on the back of his head with his foot. and the guy who had the knife looked me right in the eye and cut her throat, and let her sink to the sand. She just sinks-- She just dropped, you know. I went back and I reported to Franklin. There was an American officer in charge, and I wanted something done about it. Franklin then told me, "Okay," that he would take care of it, but he didn't want me talking about it because-- Well, I-I can't remember the exact words, but what it was is that he didn't want me to interfere with the investigation, that he would handle it. Which, which he never did. Until the day, I-- Very few days before I was out, now, I had to sit in the office of the Under Secretary of the Army, Kenneth BeLieu, who I had known for 20 years, and have him tell me, "Yes, it's a cover-up, "but it's for the good of the country, "and don't give ammunition to the peaceniks. "Forget about what happened in Vietnam. Go on with your own career." And everything else. I still couldn't believe it. Ev-even when-- Even when it was occurring. I went in, and I had to resign from the Army, and, uh, as, as things never seem to go right in the Army anymore, a fellow handed me this pen, and when I went to write, the pen broke. I arrived at the decision that I was not going back to Vietnam. I would, uh, I would not go, and the only recourse for me at that point was desertion. I deserted, uh, I spent a very brief time in Canada, crossed the border, uh, at Detroit with the help of my family, and, uh, went underground here in the United States. My father was a disabled World War II veteran. He was, uh, unemployed mostly, due to the fact that, uh, of his disability. He just couldn't get a job and would end up working mostly menial jobs. I always, uh, liked the neighborhood that I grew up in. It was mostly people like ourselves, working poor, and unemployed poor people. So our school was fully integrated, uh, we had... Ophuls: By force of circumstance. Right, by force of, uh, economics. f all the thousands who, who left the United States, um, probably only a certain percentage will attempt to come back, and I think they should know that punishment awaits them. Um, I would be very much opposed to a general amnesty. I'm opposed as, as one who has lost her husband there. I think I can speak for those who still have someone missing. Naturally, they feel they've given something and, uh, they're certainly not going to feel any too pleasant towards someone who ran out on his duty, so to speak. Here, I'd, I'd gone their route. It was evident. I, I, I did believe in that war. I did have medals. I was a model soldier for four and a half years. The criminals in the Nuremberg situation were saying, uh, "We were only following orders in what we did." And they were tried and convicted, and now these men are saying, "We refuse to carry out those orders." And they're being tried and convicted. This whole argument that Nuremberg made it a war crime to join in, in the army in Vietnam is, uh, is based on nothing. There's nothing about Nuremberg that says that. My court-martial was, I think, the first law case where Nuremberg was invoked, but the peculiar thing about it was that the defense didn't invoke it. Uh, the military invoked it. Uh, the military essentially said, "Look, we don't care whether what Dr. Levy did was medically ethical. "and we don't care whether he had, uh, freedom of speech. "The only defense that we will accept is, in fact, "if you can show that the order to train Special Forces men, "uh, was countermanded by considerations of Nuremberg." We brought three witnesses, um, who, between them, had had experience in over half of the Special Forces camps, uh, in Vietnam and just unequivocally, I think, showed that Nuremberg was, in f-- the code of Nuremberg was, in fact, being violated with great consistency by the Special Forces. Uh, there was no way that we could win with that panel of career Army officers, and, sure enough, we lost. Uh, we lost on every count, and, uh, was ultimately sentenced to, uh, three years, supposedly, at hard labor and a, uh, the equivalent of a dishonorable discharge. Ophuls: Did you serve them? Yeah, I served them. There is evidence in that case that he was being called upon to give, uh, to give instruction in the use of medicine for political and military purposes, which, uh, is quite contrary to the laws of war, and that if that were established, that would be a violation of the laws of war and he would be justified in refusing. I can, uh, certainly well envision fighting in some wars. Uh, I just simply could not envision fighting in this war. We were one of about two dozen, uh, major hospitals in Vietnam. One time a, a VC was brought in. He'd lost a great deal of blood. So we had blood expanders going in him, uh, plasma, and a medic, this is a medic that did that, came by and shut the valve off and, uh-- Which would have assured, assured the man's death. I turned it back on, told him to leave the, leave the thing alone. He shut it off again, and I turned it back on, and then he just reached for it, and I hit him, and ended up beating the shit out of him. As, uh, I saw more and more similar instances I, uh, I had to stop and think, you know? I mean, "What is this? "What, what is making, uh, guys that I knew on the block, "uh, just average guys, mistreat the Vietnamese so badly? Hate them s-- with so much passion?" As a judge, I would be more lenient on someone who was repentant. Someone, um, who thought over the lives that were possibly lost in his place. Now, those who, uh, say they have no sympathy for my boy or sympathy for my wife, I respect their feeling. Look, every man is entitled to his own feeling. I can't force 'em. Right now, Louis, uh, Louis Simon is in a stockade at Fort Dix. The military-- He did the very same thing that I did. He publicly surrendered to the military. Came all the way back from Sweden to do so. When he deserted, I had no idea at all. He did it on his own. Possibly, he felt there would be great opposition on my part. Therefore, I had no opportunity to argue with him at all. Ophuls: Uh, thinking back on it, would there have been great opposition on your part, do you think? In 1968? Mm. There would have been quite a bit of it. Yes. My feelings, uh, they waiver. They're ambivalent. It's like loving and hating somebody. I was proud of him being in the army. Uh, I had been in the Second World War. I thought it was the proper thing to do at that time, but the point is, uh, should one do what your country asks you to do, whether it's right or l-- wrong? Shouldn't one stop for a moment and analyze? "What am I doing? What has happened?" I would far more respect my son if he-- I would feel I've raised him right if, if he would go when his country needs him to go, uh, without question. His wife is a Swedish citizen. She's pregnant now. She had to return, 'cause she was with us for a while, but she had to go back to Stockholm to finish her course. She's graduating this June, and she is worried. She calls constantly, and we're waiting. Ophuls: How about your wife? Simon: She's quite affected by it. This is our first boy, and, uh, she was quite devoted with him, to him. She was left with him alone when I went overseas. He was born, uh, while I was away, and I didn't see him until I came back two years later. Robert Ransom: Louise was about six months pregnant when I went to Europe. Uh, you left in August, and, uh, Mike was born in October. October. Louise: I had this terrible feeling, and I couldn't reach Bob to tell him that he had a son, and we really treasure the fact that he finally got a cable, signed by Eisenhower, announcing that Robert Crawford Ransom, Junior, had been born and all was well. Simon: This boy was born while I was away, and here we may have the same thing, that his child may be born without him being present. Quite ironic. Ophuls: For opposite reasons. Isn't it something? Ophuls: But you did see your son. I did see my son. They became very well-acquainted. I might say that our second son was born nine months later. Robert: That was a very happy month. Ophuls: Very happy month. I remember somebody saying to us, "Well, you can feel so comforted because he died for his country." And we realized... that his death had done his country no good, and, uh, we realized... it was a s-- It was a developing process, but I think that we realized that his country had wasted him. Uh, I guess I had been an influence on him that he ought to, if he was going to serve, to serve in the highest capacity available to him, where he could do the most good. So the draft board held off long enough for him to enlist, so that he could go to OCS. Louise: Officer Candidate School. And then, of course, when he knew that he had his orders to Vietnam, we had a lot of discussion, and, uh, of course, at that point, not to go would have meant a six-year jail sentence for him. You know, he really liked people, and he cared about them and, um, I think he had to wrestle a whole lot with himself. Plus, he was on-- you know, 22 years old, and he didn't want to go to jail for six years. So-- Robert: But when he left the house, after his terminal leave, to take his plane to Vietnam, he told us very frankly that he couldn't tell us at that point whether he was gonna get on that plane or not, and I, I, I've always kicked myself ever since for the fact that I didn't lean on him harder then to live up to his conscience, which I could read, uh, and not get aboard. All I did was tell him that we'd understood and supported him completely if he didn't wish to, and that we'd get him the best trial lawyer in the United States and fight it as hard as we could, and, uh, yeah, in that frame of reference, he left, and uh-- But I-- Bob has always blamed himself for not saying more, and I think that he's wrong to do that, because Mike was his own man, you know. He, he could make up his own mind, and it was his decision to go. He was only there two months and, uh, but he did write a lot, and he said everybody in the countryside hated him. Robert: He was assigned to the Eleventh Light Infantry Brigade and, and the Eleventh was the one that committed the My Lai massacre, and... Louise: He wrote clearly, "I just don't understand. This smiling farmer by day is my enemy at night." From the day he got that assignment to the day he died, um, the platoon, so far as we know, and from what he told us, never fired a shot in anger, uh, and they just kept being twiddled away by, by mines. He said, "I'd machine-gun every man, woman and child in that village," for having laughed at them after he'd lost a man. And the thing that-- as, again, we understand much more, in this My Lai episode, which we didn't understand when we first read his letters, was that he was experiencing the outright naked hatred of the people that he thought he was fighting for. You know, he-- And, of course, the United States government didn't bother to tell Mike didn't bother to tell Mike that My Lai had occurred the week before and that-- If they had, he might have expected a little resentment on their part. Uh, well, we got a telegram that he had been very seriously wounded, and, uh, so we instantly, uh, got on the phone. Bob wanted to follow up on the report, and, uh, he did, uh, hit a mine and, uh, he died, uh, eight days later. Robert: And they said, well, "Somebody's on the way to see you, Mr. Ransom." And we knew perfectly well what that meant, and then we went through that gruesome situation, where they have a couple of officers come and call on you, and they have a little book that says what to do when a soldier dies, and they-- I won't, uh, go through all those horrible details. Keating: Purple Heart. The National Defense Medal. Medals that he received from the Vietnamese government. The children are too small to recall their father, and I wanted them especially to be proud that he served his country. Especially in a war when it would have been easy to do otherwise. Every s-- American soldier who was killed in Vietnam was posthumously awarded with two Vietnamese medals that are just revolting, and the-- You get a little message from the president, too, about cooperating with the, with his forces in stopping the "Red Menace." Uh, that wasn't what the war was all about, as far as, as I'm concerned. Nobody can charge Lyndon Johnson with anything anymore. Uh, Robert McNamara, George Bundy, the best and the brightest, are certainly not going to be paying any penalties. It's in the light of that, that the cause of amnesty becomes even more important. We must let those people come back to America. This is their country. Who knows which of those men in Canada has the key to the preservation of the ecology? Who knows which man has the key to peace? How many men who really love this country more than men who went and fought are among them? So they all come home. Those men who, who want revenge, forgive them, and they, in turn, must forgive Nixon, Westmoreland, Calley, and we must all sit down and say to ourselves, not, "I was right and you were wrong," but, "What went wrong?" There were many, uh, drafted young men who lost their lives because someone ran away, and I, I just don't think you can let them off scot-free. Herbert: Revenge takes more from the man who gets it than the man that it is gotten from. Both people lose something in the exchange. I think we should let them come home. Yeah. Yeah. Ophuls: There is a book, uh, that you may have read, called, uh, Military Justice Is to Justice as Military Music Is to Music. Right. Uh, have you read the book? Do you agree with it? I looked through a good deal of it. Yes, uh, well-- The title seems very amusing. The title is amusing, and I'm afraid it, uh, pinked me in a tender spot, because, uh, one of, of my hobbies is, is, doing a little composing, and most of it has come out as military music, as a matter of fact. Yeah, I do have, uh, have one here, if you would like to hear a bit of it. Ophuls: Yes. (marching band music plays) Taylor: Those marches are being played by a band in Central Park that I was conducting. ♪ ♪ Ophuls: Your book, Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy, has a-- what is it called in English? A dedi, dedicace? Taylor: Dedication? Ophuls: Dedication, yes. What is the dedication? To the flag. To the flag and the liberty and justice for which it stands. Ophuls: On that trip to Hanoi, you went with people who don't, perhaps, share these opinions about the American flag. Taylor: One of them was an outright pacifist. One of them was much more left than I am. We saw things quite differently, and on coming out, we didn't wish to give an impression of disunity, and, uh, there was a press conference in Hong Kong where the media had asked about the bombing of the Bach Mai Hospital. We had all four seen the hospital a few hours after the bombing. We all four knew that it'd been bombed. There was no question about that. The Pentagon building had denied that the hospital had been hit, or said it was only very slightly hit. We all four knew perfectly well it had been totally destroyed. So we said that. Reporter 1: Can you clarify that, sir? If the particular hospital is the Bach Mai Hospital, it's blown to smithereens. Completely destroyed. But the next question was, uh, did, did we think it was done on purpose? Reporter #2: Do you think that this is intentional bombing of civilian areas? That's a matter that we can't go into now. Not me, anyhow. To that question, we would have given different answers, and so I did not answer that question until two days later. I wouldn't know. I just saw what I saw, and that's it. Reporter 1: I'm sorry, uh, Mr. Taylor-- I'd like to say, uh, I just don't think there's any such thing as an accidental bombing. I think we're all full of a great many impressions that we have not had time to digest fully and, and put in place, and, uh, a lot of these questions, uh, require more considered answers after we've had time to reflect. Reporter 2: Is this a Hitler, Hitler-like crime, as the North Vietnamese have been describing? That's another question of the same kind, I'm afraid. No, I wouldn't want to answer that now. My answer, two days later, uh, was that I did not think that it had been done on purpose. Uh, later on, uh, I obtained what seemed to me perfectly good substantiation of this. The hospital, which I did not know at the time, was only about a quarter of a mile from a military airport. So, it seemed highly probable, if not certain, that the bombing of the hospital was the result of a miss on the airfield. This did not mean that the episode, uh, uh, seemed to me, because unintentional, to be an admirable one. To bomb that close to Hanoi, and in the vicinity of a hospital, which they knew they were there-- was there, was altogether too likely to result in hitting the hospital, which it did. I think I've answered enough questions for this interview. I'm not gonna speak anymore. I have too. Herbert: It was in Madrid. I had a few days off at Christmas, so I bought, uh, five Joan Baez records and I took a room at the, uh, officers' BOQ, and I was playing them in the BOQ, and a fellow knocked on the door in civilian clothes and he asked me, "Aren't those Joan Baez records?" (singing "Parachutiste" in French) (crowd applauds) And I said, "Yeah." He said, "Are you a fan?" I said, "I don't know. How many records do you have to have to be a fan?" He said, "Three." I said, "I'm a fan. You know, I have five. I mean, I meet the requirements." And he said, "Well, we don't, uh, we don't permit those records to be played in here." And I said, "That's ridiculous. I mean, you now, why not?" And he said, "She's a communist, you know." I said, "No, I didn't know, you know?" "But she's a good singer, and I've already paid for the records. "I mean, I'm gonna play them." And he said, "Well, if you play those records, you're gonna have to leave here." (Joan Baez continues singing in French) ♪ ♪ Herbert: They were very willing to give me a slip. "Non-availability. We don't have a room for this guy." So I went down to live at the Madrid Hilton.

Actually, the evidence of connection with serious war crimes on a large scale was far stronger against Speer than against Streicher. Speer was an attractive man.

(speaking German) It was easier for me than for other Jews. My family had not suffered as others had. If my wife or my children had been-- had been destroyed, I probably couldn't have done it. Those who came to my concerts, came as people in need. There may well have been a few Nazis among them, too, but judgment is a retroactive affair, and very important it is, too. Menuhin: I think that so long as people are guilty of crimes and perpetrating them, judgment is essential. Today, torture has become as international as anything else. I mean, the means, the know-how, is supplied by the United States and Russia, and is practiced in Brazil and in Chile, and, and we must combat universal evil, which is no longer confined to borders or to systems. When I speak with the Germans, I feel that my role is, is not to judge. I feel there must be judges. There must be law. Law must be enforced, and law should be universal, but I am not the judge. I think it's always embarrassing if the judge is someone who himself doesn't suffer from the action or is someone who has just won the battle. I think judgment should ideally come from within the person who has committed the crime. (soft violin music) ♪ ♪ (violin continues) (music ends)
