DON'T HANG UP. JUST LISTEN. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDAISY, ARE YOU \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSTILL THERE? YES, I'M STILL HERE. WHAT IS IT YOU WANT NOW? \h\h\h\hI WANT TO TELL YOU-- I DON'T KNOW HOW ALL THAT HAPPENED, BUT IT WASN'T YOU, AND IT WASN'T ME. DAISY, DARLING, DON'T LET IT END LIKE THIS. [ Daisy ] IT DIDN'T END TONIGHT. IT ENDED A LONG TIME AGO. YOU MAKE ME SO ASHAMED OF BOTH OF US. \h\h\h\h[ Dan ] I KNOW. DAISY, LOOK. I HAD TO CALL YOU. THIS IS THE WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. I HAD TO TELL YOU... \hI LOVE YOU. AND I LIKE YOU, \hAND I ALWAYS WILL. YOU'RE THE ONLY THING IN MY LIFE THAT MATTERS. [ Daisy ] SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT? SHALL I SAY TO PETER, "DAN O'MARA'S STILL \hMY BEST FRIEND, "EVEN THOUGH HE BETRAYED \hEVERYTHING I THOUGHT \hABOUT HIM? WE MUSTN'T HOLD THAT AGAINST HIM." SHALL I SIT DOWN AND WRITE THAT TO PETER? OH, NO. OH, NO, MRS. LAPHAM, OR SHOULD I SAY DAISY? DON'T YOU BOTHER TO WRITE YOUR HUSBAND. IT'S NONE OF HIS BUSINESS, IS IT? WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON, MR. LAPHAM AND I. LUCILLE! [ Phone Jingles ] HE OUGHT TO KNOW THIS THING'S GOING TO GO ON FOREVER. HE OUGHT TO KNOW YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON THAT MATTERS TO DAN! \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h[ Slams ] [ Sighs ] YOU'RE STANDING THERE, THINKING I'LL CALM DOWN. IF YOU GET ME STARTED TALKING, I'LL CALM DOWN. [ Gasps ] \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWELL, YOU'RE WRONG. FOR A LONG TIME, I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE WORTH KILLING, BUT YOU ARE. DADDY. IT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS JUST TALK. YOU BETTER GO TO BED, DEAR. TAKE SOMETHING TO HELP YOU SLEEP. I'M GOING TO DIVORCE HIM. I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY LONGER. I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE WHAT A BITTER THING DIVORCE IS. YOU'LL ONLY BE TORTURING THE CHILDREN AND YOURSELF. GO TO BED, DEAR. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT IT MORE CALMLY IN THE MORNING. AFTER ALL, YOU DON'T BREAK UP A MARRIAGE JUST ON THE EVIDENCE OF A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION. HE SAYS I TREAT THE CHILDREN AS IF THEY WERE BABIES. ALL RIGHT, I WON'T ANYMORE. THEY'RE GROWN-UP ENOUGH TO LEARN WHAT KIND OF A FATHER THEY'VE GOT. [ Footsteps Approaching ] YOU COULDN'T SLEEP EITHER? I DON'T SEE HOW I MISSED YOU. \hI COVERED BOTH WATERFRONTS. DON'T GO IN YET. YOUR FRIEND MARY'S SEEN ENOUGH OF ME FOR ONE NIGHT. DAISY, I THINK I'M HUMBLE NOW. I WASN'T BEFORE, BUT I AM NOW. I HAVEN'T STARTED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE MESS AT HOME YET. I HAD TO HAVE A LOOK AT YOU FIRST. DAN, DON'T-- \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hJUST A LOOK. I COULDN'T GO ON THINKING OF YOU WITH THAT EXPRESSION IN YOUR EYES. OH. I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE COMING BACK. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO STAY. LUCILLE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I DID THE TALKING FOR HER. AS WHAT? HER FATHER OR HER LAWYER? A LITTLE OF BOTH. SHE WANTS A DIVORCE, AND I CAN'T TALK HER OUT OF IT. THE ONLY QUESTION IS, WHAT KIND? THE BEST THAT MONEY CAN BUY, I GUESS. LUCILLE'S QUITE BITTER AT THE MOMENT. PERHAPS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. SHE WANTS TO DIVORCE YOU IN NEW YORK AND NAME MRS. LAPHAM. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAND WHAT DO YOU THINK? I MIGHT BE ABLE TO PERSUADE HER TO DO IT THE EASIER WAY, IF YOU'D COOPERATE ABOUT THE CHILDREN. AND WHAT IS HER IDEA OF COOPERATION ABOUT THE CHILDREN? SOLE AND ABSOLUTE CUSTODY. OF COURSE, EVENTUALLY, YOU'D BE ABLE TO SEE THEM WHEN THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE GROWN-UP. BUT LUCILLE THINKS THERE SHOULD BE A CLEAN BREAK NOW TILL THEY'RE ADJUSTED TO IT. PERHAPS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. TILL SHE'S SOLD THEM ON THE IDEA THAT I'VE RUN OUT ON THEM. [ Chuckles ] WELL, COME NOW, PAPA. LET'S TALK SENSE. LUCILLE KNOWS I'D NEVER GO FOR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THEN WE FILE THE SUIT. THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE, DAN. YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND LET ME KNOW. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWELL, THANKS. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI'LL PHONE YOU. OH, I'LL BE IN THE OFFICE. BUT I WON'T. I'M PULLING OUT OF THE FIRM, SUGARPLUM. PERHAPS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT, DAN, THERE'S NO REASON WHY A PURELY PERSONAL CONFLICT-- SURE, THERE IS-- YOUR SENSITIVE NATURE. YOU'D WEAR A SMILE, I KNOW, BUT DEEP DOWN, YOU'D BE WINCING EVERY TIME WE MET. YOUR HUMOR'S IN RATHER BAD TASTE. BESIDES, IT WOULD GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO OCCUPY YOUR TIME. WITHOUT ME AROUND, YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK FOR YOUR INCOME. THIS MR. O'MARA'S OFFICE? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYES. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU'RE MR. LAPHAM? YES. HE'S EXPECTING YOU. GO RIGHT IN, PLEASE. HELLO. WELCOME TO CHAOS, MR. LAPHAM. THROW ME MY HAT, SWEETHEART. MERVYN, YOU UNDERSTAND ALL THIS IS TO GO TO THE NEW OFFICE. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYES, MR. O'MARA. GOOD-BYE, DARLINGS. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. \h\h\h\hGOOD-BYE, MR. O'MARA. MR. LAPHAM, YOU'LL THINK IT'S STRANGE. I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF ASKING YOU TO COME HERE. HELLO, HONEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? C-CAN I SEE YOU IN YOUR OFFICE, DADDY? A NEW CLIENT ALREADY. O'MARA RETAINED BY O'MARA. PLEASE, DAN. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A SECOND, MR. LAPHAM. NOW, WHAT IS IT, SWEETHEART? ROSAMUND WAS COMING, TOO, TO TALK TO YOU. SHE SAID HERSELF IT WAS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT. AND THEN MILLICENT HARRISON ASKED HER TO GO TO A MOVIE. BUT, ANYWAYS, IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. WHAT IS THIS THAT'S SO IMPORTANT, HONEY? I'M GONNA LIVE WITH YOU. I DON'T CARE WHAT ROSAMUND DOES, BUT I'M GONNA LIVE WITH YOU. AT THE CLUB, BABY? LADIES AREN'T ALLOWED THERE. ALL RIGHT, I'LL MOVE FROM THE CLUB, JUST AS SOON AS I CAN. THEN YOU AND ROS CAN COME AND LIVE WITH ME. WHENEVER IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOUR MOMMY, THAT IS. IT WON'T BE ALL RIGHT WITH HER. DAN, IT'S AWFUL THERE WITHOUT YOU. WHY IS IT SO AWFUL, HONEY? I WAS ALWAYS AWAY A LOT. YOU'LL SEE ME JUST AS MUCH, MAYBE EVEN MORE. WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE, SHE HATES ME. OH, NO. YOU'RE WRONG. SHE'D NEVER HATE YOU. YOU MUSTN'T THINK BECAUSE ANYBODY'S UNHAPPY, THEY HATE YOU. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN, SWEETHEART. YOU'RE ALL WRONG ABOUT YOUR MOTHER. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSUPPOSE I PICK YOU UP \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hFROM SCHOOL TOMORROW? I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT TODAY. NO, TOMORROW. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO. WE'LL GO SOMEPLACE AND HAVE TEA-- A REGULAR, GROWN-UP DATE, JUST THE TWO OF US, HMM? OH, MERVYN? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYES, SIR? WOULD YOU TAKE MARIE AND SHOW HER THE NEW OFFICE? THEN SEE THAT SHE GETS HOME OKAY. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYES, SIR. SO LONG, HONEYBUNCH. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. I'M NOT GONNA LIVE WITH HER. I WON'T. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT TOMORROW, BABY. I'M SORRY I KEPT YOU WAITING, MR. LAPHAM. WHY DID YOU WIRE ME, MR. O'MARA? HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED? NO, I WIRED YOU BECAUSE I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT NOTHING'S HAPPENED. WELL, THAT'S CLEAR NOW. WE'RE MEETING DAISY. I DIDN'T TELL HER YOU WERE COMING DOWN. [ Chattering ] WELL, THERE SHE IS ALREADY. HELLO, HONEYBUNCH. \h\h\h\hHELLO, MR. O'MARA. HELLO, DAISY. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHELLO, DARLING. HELLO. WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK? BOURBON AND WATER, PLEASE. ONE BOURBON AND WATER AND TWO MARTINIS. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYES, SIR. DO YOU TWO GET TOGETHER OFTEN? NOT AS OFTEN AS WE SHOULD. WEREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE TRIAL RUN ON DINO'S BOAT TODAY? THEY'RE WAITING FOR ME TO FLY BACK TONIGHT. WHY'D YOU COME DOWN? I WIRED HIM. I HAVE THINGS TO SAY TO BOTH OF YOU, AND THERE'S NO POINT IN SAYING THEM TWICE. I WIRED YOU, MR. LAPHAM, BECAUSE I THINK MISUNDERSTANDINGS ARE CHILDISH. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWE'RE GROWN-UP PEOPLE. I BELIEVE WE ARE. DON'T YOU KNOW IT? I HAVE A HUNCH THAT WHEN PEOPLE KEEP ON TALKING ABOUT HOW GROWN-UP THEY ARE, IT ONLY MEANS THEY'RE NOT VERY SURE OF IT, MR. O'MARA. WELL, IF YOU'LL LET ME TALK, MAYBE YOU WON'T WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT THAT. LET'S SIMPLIFY ONE THING AT LEAST. HE'S CALLED PETER, AND YOU'RE DAN. IT ALL STARTED ON WEDNESDAY. I'D HAD A BAD DAY. I LOST A CASE THAT-- WELL, THERE'S NO POINT IN GOING INTO THAT. BUT I WENT OVER TO 12th STREET, AND I BEHAVED LIKE A HEEL. YOUR WIFE RESISTED. I'LL BE FRANK TO SAY IF SHE HADN'T RESISTED, WE WOULDN'T ALL BE SITTING HERE NOW. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hANY QUESTIONS \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hABOUT THAT? NO, NOTHING IMPORTANT. WHY ISN'T IT IMPORTANT? BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENED. YOU'RE NOT GETTING HOSTILE, ARE YOU? THAT WASN'T ON THE AGENDA. HONEYBUNCH, I'M NOT HOSTILE. HONEST. GO ON. I WANT ANOTHER MARTINI. YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED THE FIRST ONE YET. WELL, THAT'S THAT. IF IT WERE SOMETHING THAT ONLY CONCERNED THE THREE OF US, WE WOULDN'T NEED TO SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT. BUT I'M ASKING YOUR PERMISSION TO LET ME TURN OUR PRIVATE AFFAIRS INTO NEWSPAPER COPY. LUCILLE IS SUING ME FOR DIVORCE. SHE WANTS TO DO IT IN NEW YORK, NAMING DAISY AS CORESPONDENT. THEY FIGURE, IN ORDER TO KEEP DAISY'S NAME OUT OF THE NEWSPAPER, I'LL SIGN AWAY THE RIGHT TO SEE MY CHILDREN. OH, NO, DAN. YOU MUSTN'T. IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE FOR THEM-- MARIE, ESPECIALLY. I'M PUTTING IT UP TO YOU. IT'S NOT A THING TO BE DECIDED WITHOUT REALIZING WHAT IT INVOLVES. THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF COPY SUNDAY SUPPLEMENT EDITORS ARE LOOKING FOR. WELL, IF THEY WANT A FIGHT, WE'LL GIVE IT TO THEM. WE HAVE MARY AS A WITNESS. I'M SURE WE CAN LICK IT. I'LL CLEAR YOU, BABY. MAY I SPEAK NOW, MR. CHAIRMAN? I SUPPOSE SO. I SAID IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME, UH, WHAT'S HAPPENED RECENTLY BETWEEN YOU AND DAISY, AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU CLEAR DAISY OR DON'T CLEAR HER. THAT NICE POINT WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE SO MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THE READING PUBLIC... WON'T MEAN A THING TO ME. I'M NOT BEING HOSTILE. YOU SEE, I WALKED INTO THIS MARRIAGE WITH MY EYES OPEN. I KNEW WHAT I WAS UP AGAINST. IT WAS A LONG SHOT, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH THE CHANCE. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWELL, WASN'T IT? I CAN'T COMPLAIN. I PUSHED MY WAY INTO YOUR LIFE, DAISY, BECAUSE I NEEDED YOU. WELL, I'M FINE NOW. BETTER THAN EITHER OF YOU. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT ISN'T \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hALL THERE IS TO IT. THE ONLY REASON I WAS ABLE TO BREAK IN WAS THAT HE DIDN'T LOVE YOU ENOUGH THEN. IF I HAD MET YOU NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME, WOULD I BE ABLE TO BREAK IN? I'LL DO MY OWN THINKING, THANK YOU, AND MY OWN EXISTING. I'M ALL FOR THAT. THAT'S WHY I'M LEAVING IT UP TO YOU. SO THAT YOU CAN WORK THIS THING OUT FOR YOURSELF... WITHOUT BEING BOTHERED BY THE TECHNICAL DRAWBACK OF A HUSBAND. THAT'S A FORMALITY WE CAN DISPOSE OF ANY TIME YOU GIVE THE SIGNAL. I DON'T WANT A WIFE ON FORMALITIES. \h\h\h\hPETER, HOW CAN YOU \h\h\h\hSAY A THING-- [ Kisses ] I DIDN'T PLAN THIS, BABY. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT. I'M ALMOST GLAD IT HAPPENED. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A CRISIS TO SHOW WHAT'S REALLY INSIDE PEOPLE. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU DON'T MEAN THAT. DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT I MEAN! LET'S GO. I DON'T LIKE IT HERE. IT WAS CLOSE TO 8:00, WASN'T IT? WHEN YOU RETURNED TO THE APARTMENT... AND DISCOVERED MR. O'MARA THERE? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYES. AND YOU HAD BEEN GONE SINCE A LITTLE AFTER 4:00? YES, BUT IT'S HARDLY IMPORTANT, SINCE HIS PLANE DIDN'T GET IN TILL 5:30. [ Man ] YOU TESTIFIED ON DIRECT EXAMINATION... THAT YOU WERE SURPRISED TO SEE MR. O'MARA, DID YOU NOT? YOU HEARD ME. [ Murmuring ] SO I DID. BUT I FOUND YOUR SURPRISE, SHALL I SAY, SURPRISING. YOU WERE CERTAINLY AWARE THAT THE TIES BETWEEN MRS. LAPHAM AND MR. O'MARA... WERE MORE THAN THOSE OF A CASUAL ACQUAINTANCESHIP. OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. QUESTION IS AMBIGUOUS... AND CALLS FOR A CONCLUSION ON THE PART OF THE WITNESS. OBJECTION SUSTAINED. LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. YOU HAD SEEN MR. O'MARA IN MRS. LAPHAM'S APARTMENT... ON SEVERAL PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, HAD YOU NOT? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBEFORE SHE WAS MARRIED. OH, YES, THAT WAS BEFORE SHE WAS MARRIED. THEN YOUR SURPRISE CAME FROM YOUR ASSUMPTION... THAT HER MARRIAGE HAD ENDED THEIR PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI KNEW IT HAD! \h\h\h[ Chuckling ] [ Man ] I STAND CORRECTED. BUT SINCE WE MUST DEAL HERE WITH EVIDENCE, RATHER THAN OPINIONS, COULD YOU TELL EXACTLY WHAT CONCRETE FACTS MADE YOU SO POSITIVE OF THE CHANGE? WELL, I-- I JUST KNEW IT. THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU, MISS ANGELUS. YOU ARE A DEVOTED FRIEND. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hARE YOU THROUGH \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWITH THE WITNESS? YES, YOUR HONOR. UH, NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR. [ Judge ] THEN WE'LL RECESS TILL 1:00. [ Chattering ] HOLD IT, PLEASE, MISS KENYON. ROSAMUND! \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDON'T BLAME ME, DAN. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIT'S MARIE. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR EAR? HONEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR EAR? IT'S THE COLD. THE MINUTE WE WALKED OUT OF THE HOUSE, IT STARTED BLEEDING. IF YOU'RE NOT HOME IN HALF AN HOUR, THERE'LL BE NO FUR JACKET FOR CHRISTMAS. AND HAVE DR. RIEMER LOOK AT THAT EAR. [ Lucille ] I HAD HIM LOOK AT IT THIS MORNING. HE SAYS IT'S NOTHING. DID SHE HAVE A BLOW OF SOME KIND? NO. IT'S PURELY A NERVOUS THING. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. ALL RIGHT, LUCILLE. \h\h\h\hTHANKS! WILL YOU SEE THAT THEY GET HOME, OR SHALL I? I THINK THAT'S UP TO ME, DON'T YOU? COME ON, GIRLS. THE LUNCHROOM IS A FLIGHT DOWN. SHALL WE WALK? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT LAWYER'S BUILDING A CASE FOR THE PAPERS AND NOTHING ELSE. [ Sighs ] WHY, DAN O'MARA. I'M SORRY. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI KNOW. YOU LIKE TO BUILD, NOT DESTROY THINGS. I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING ABOUT THAT EAR. WHEN LUCILLE FIRST HEARD ABOUT YOU, SHE TOOK IT OUT ON THE CHILD. SHE ALWAYS HAS EVER SINCE. I SUPPOSE SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO HIT HER SO HARD. OH, DAISY, FORGIVE ME FOR THIS. SURE, BABY, I FORGIVE YOU. YOU KNOW, IT'S A COMMON PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON IN ALL THE NORTHERN COUNTRIES... THAT THE FIRST SNOW OF THE YEAR CAUSES ACUTE DEPRESSIONS. THAT MUST BE IT. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYES, \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT MUST BE IT. DO YOU DENY THAT BEFORE YOUR MARRIAGE TO MR. LAPHAM... YOU WERE IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH MR. O'MARA? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNO. AND THE TESTIMONY OF THE REAL ESTATE BROKER-- THAT MR. O'MARA RENTED AN APARTMENT IN THE EAST 60s. IF HE DID, I NEVER LIVED IN IT. THE PLACE I LIVED IN WAS MY OWN. I HAD A GOOD JOB. I STILL HAVE IT. DO YOU WANT ME TO PROVE THAT TOO? THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. BUT TELL ME THIS, MRS. LAPHAM. IN THE PERIOD OF YOUR, UH, CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH MR. O'MARA, YOU CAN TELL THE COURT HOW OFTEN YOU HAD ENGAGEMENTS WITH OTHER MEN. YOUR HONOR, I MUST POINT OUT AGAIN THAT MY DIRECT EXAMINATION OF MRS. LAPHAM... WAS CONCERNED SOLELY WITH THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING OF LAST SEPTEMBER 12. IT IS MY PURPOSE TO PROVE THAT THE EVENTS OF THE PAST... FORM A VERY SUBSTANTIAL BACKGROUND FOR WHAT HAPPENED THAT EVENING. BE THAT AS IT MAY, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ESTABLISH IT IN THIS CROSS-EXAMINATION. YOU TESTIFIED EARLIER THAT YOUR MARRIAGE WAS A HAPPY ONE. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWAS THAT TRUE \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hON SEPTEMBER 12? YES. AND ON SEPTEMBER 13? I DID NOT SEE MY HUSBAND ON SEPTEMBER 13. ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND HAVE NOT LIVED TOGETHER... SINCE THE NIGHT OF MR. O'MARA'S RETURN FROM CALIFORNIA? OBJECTION! I SUBMIT THIS WHOLE LINE OF QUESTIONING IS IRRELEVANT. MAY I ADD SOMETHING TO THAT, YOUR HONOR? I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO ASK SUCH QUESTIONS. BUT WHETHER YOU HAVE OR NOT, I PROTEST THEM. I PROTEST YOU AS A HUMAN BEING. THAT WILL DO, MRS. LAPHAM. THE OBJECTION IS OVERRULED. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE WITNESS TO TELL US, IN HER OWN WORDS, JUST WHAT IS THE PRESENT STATUS OF HER MARRIAGE, AND WHAT BROUGHT IT ABOUT. WELL, IT-IT IS TRUE THAT MY HUSBAND AND I ARE NOT LIVING TOGETHER AT THE PRESENT TIME. BUT IT WASN'T CAUSED BY WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. AT LEAST, HE SAID IT WASN'T. PETER DID-- MY HUSBAND-- HE SAID IT WASN'T IMPORTANT. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOUR HONOR, \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMAY I SAY A WORD? [ Murmuring ] IF IT IS AGREEABLE WITH PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL. THIS IS HIS CROSS-EXAMINATION. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hCERTAINLY, YOUR HONOR. I REQUEST A RECESS IN THIS TRIAL... FOR THE PURPOSE OF A PRIVATE CONFERENCE WITH THE PLAINTIFF. [ Murmuring ] [ Gavel Raps ] THE STATE IS ALWAYS WILLING TO GRANT SUCH A REQUEST IN A DIVORCE CASE. MY CHAMBERS ARE AT YOUR DISPOSAL. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. WHY DID YOU DO THAT? I COULD'VE GONE ON. MAYBE YOU COULD, BUT I COULDN'T. THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO WAIT AROUND HERE. GO HOME. I'LL COME BY LATER. BUT WHY DID YOU THROW IN THE SPONGE? I LEARNED WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO ME WHILE YOU WERE UP THERE. WHAT REALLY MATTERS? I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT. IT HAS TO DO WITH HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU. JACK, HAVE MARSHA FIND PETER LAPHAM, WHEREVER HE IS. TRACE HIM DOWN FROM THE CAPE, BUT FIND HIM. I TRUST WE ALL REALIZE THERE'S NO SENSE IN CARRYING ON WITH THAT SIDESHOW OUT THERE. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDAN, I-- PLEASE, LUCILLE. \h\h\h\hBEFORE THERE'S ANY TALK OF \h\h\h\hA RECONCILIATION, I'D LIKE-- SKIP IT, PAPA. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY RECONCILIATION. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHEN WE'LL PROCEED. FOR WHAT? YOU HAVEN'T GOT A PRAYER ON THAT KIND OF EVIDENCE. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI THINK-- LET'S NOT WASTE TIME WITH WHAT YOU THINK. ASK SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS A LITTLE LAW. YOU CAN GO ON RAISING THE ROOF, I'LL ADMIT THAT. BUT WHAT'S THE POINT? I'LL AGREE TO YOUR ORIGINAL TERMS IN EXCHANGE FOR A QUIET DIVORCE IN NEVADA. YOU'LL HAVE THE GIRLS ALL TO YOURSELF, LUCY. GIVE 'EM A BREAK. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHEY DON'T WANT ME. THEY WILL, IF YOU WORK AT IT. I'LL BE READY TO TAKE 'EM IF THE JOB GETS TOO MUCH FOR YOU. OH, DAN, IT'S NO GOOD. IT'S NO GOOD WITHOUT THE TWO OF US. NEITHER OF US ALONE IS ENOUGH FOR THEM. OH, DAN, I'VE HURT YOU. I'VE HURT THE GIRLS, AND DAISY, BUT-- BUT NOBODY AS MUCH AS MYSELF. I'M SORRY, HONEY. THIS DIDN'T START OUT AS MY IDEA. YOU CARRY ON WITH THE DETAILS, WILL YOU, QUINN? [ Lucille Sobbing ] HELLO, MR. LAPHAM. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMR. LAPHAM. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIS THE BOSS BACK \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hFROM COURT YET? YES, HE GOT BACK HALF HOUR AGO. I'M SO GLAD WE FOUND YOU SO QUICKLY. HE'S WAITING FOR YOU. [ Intercom Buzzes ] \h\h\h\hYES? MR. LAPHAM IS HERE. SHOW HIM IN. WELL, HELLO, PETER. I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU IN TOWN. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE? SOME TIME. I'M WORKING ON PLANS FOR A DIESEL FISHING FLEET. I CALLED YOU TO SEE IF YOU STILL MEANT SOMETHING YOU SAID AT OUR LAST MEETING. OH, SIT DOWN, WON'T YOU? HAVE A CIGAR OR ANYTHING? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNO, THANKS. NO CIGAR. \hNO ANYTHING. WHAT DID I SAY? THAT YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO BOW OUT OF YOUR MARRIAGE ANYTIME DAISY GAVE THE SIGNAL. YES, I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY ACCURATE QUOTE. AM I BEING SIGNALED? I WANT TO MARRY HER. I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF DRAWING UP THE NECESSARY PAPERS. NATURALLY, DAISY DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING FROM YOU, AND I ASSUME YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING FROM HER. WHERE DO I SIGN? YOU KNOW, I'M COMPLETELY BAFFLED BY YOU. WELL, I DON'T PRETEND TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF IN DETAIL, BUT WHAT IS IT THAT BOTHERS YOU? I WAS PRETTY SURE AT ONE TIME THAT YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH DAISY. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWHO SAID I WASN'T? WELL, HERE YOU ARE GIVING HER UP WITHOUT A MURMUR. THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS PUNCH ME IN THE NOSE. I'D BE HAPPY TO, IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING. SUPPOSE YOU GIVE ME ALL THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF IT, THEN-- FORGET IT. I MIGHT BE TOO CONVINCING. RIGHT HERE. THREE COPIES. DID SHE PREFER THAT I SIGN FIRST? WHO? DAISY? WELL, NO. NOT EXACTLY. I'M AFRAID I DIDN'T MAKE MYSELF QUITE CLEAR. THE FACT IS, I HAVEN'T ASKED HER YET. OH. WELL, DON'T YOU THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO... GO THROUGH ALL THE FORMALITIES IN THEIR PROPER ORDER? SURE, IF YOU THINK SO. WHY DON'T WE CALL DAISY AND GO SEE HER? FINE. WHY DON'T WE? [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Stops ] TRYING TO SNEAK OUT BEFORE I PAY THE RENT? I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. THAT PHONE'S BEEN RINGING EVER SINCE I CAME IN. I'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS NOW. I CAN'T FIGURE YOU. YOU'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH DAN FOR SO LONG, AND NOW THAT HE'S STOPPED THE TRIAL TO SAVE-- \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI CAN'T FIGURE MYSELF. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING AWAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT. IT'S ABOUT TIME I FOUND OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL. [ Phone Ringing ] YES? YES, DAN? PETER'S WITH YOU? OH, NO. NO, I'M NOT UP TO THAT KIND OF CIVILIZED NONSENSE. PLEASE, DAN, DON'T BRING HIM HERE, AND DON'T COME YOURSELF. I'VE JUST GOT TO BE ALONE FOR A FEW DAYS. MY WORK'S PILED UP ON. [ Daisy Sniffling ] WANT TO TELL ME WHERE YOU'RE GOING, SO I'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO LIE ABOUT? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTO THE CAPE. [ Ringing ] HELLO. OH. I'LL SEE IF SHE'S HERE. IT'S LUCILLE O'MARA, SOUNDING 10 TIMES WORSE THAN YOU. HANG UP ON HER, OR SHE'LL BE CALLING YOU ALL NIGHT. SURE, BABY. I'LL HELP YOU WITH THAT. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHANK YOU. THANK YOU. CAN I HELP YOU WITH THE BAGS, MA'AM? NO, THANK YOU. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNOTHING ELSE \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI CAN DO? NO. \hNO, THANK YOU. [ Ringing ] - HELLO? - BABY, WE'RE HERE \h\hAT MILLS LANDING. WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO FACE THIS THING OUT. IT'S NO USE RUNNING AWAY. DON'T YOU EVER BELIEVE WHAT I SAY? I'VE GOT TO BE ALONE.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? IT'S NOT VERY SMART DRIVING AROUND THESE ROADS ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS. I'M NOT VERY SMART. CALL IT OFF? BETTER, THOUGH I WOULD HAVE BLITZED YOU. I DIDN'T HEAR THE CAR COME IN. I HAD KIND OF A CRACK-UP. WHAT HAPPENED, BABY? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU HURT? NO, I'M ALL RIGHT. CAR'LL HAVE TO BE TOWED IN THOUGH. IT'S ABOUT TWO MILES DOWN THE ROAD. WE CAN WORRY ABOUT THAT LATER. IS THERE A DOCTOR ANYWHERE NEAR? PLEASE BELIEVE ME. I'M ALL RIGHT. MATTER OF FACT, I FEEL A LOT BETTER THAN I HAVE IN WEEKS. MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET CLEAR ON THINGS. SHOCK TREATMENT. WELL, IF YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, LET'S ELECT A CHAIRMAN AND GET ON WITH THE MEETING. THE CAB IS DUE ANY MINUTE TO TAKE ONE OF US BACK TO THE STATION. SEEMS TO ME YOU'VE MADE A LOT OF PLANS ALL ON YOUR OWN, YOU TWO. WELL, THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY MEETING. I KNOW WHAT I WANT. YOU'RE BOTH GOING BACK TO NEW YORK. AND LEAVE YOU HERE ALONE WITH NOTHING SETTLED? BABY, YOU'VE GOT TO STOP RUNNING AWAY. I HAVE STOPPED RUNNING AWAY. WELL, WHO HAS THE FLOOR? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWHO DO YOU THINK? NOT NECESSARILY, HONEYBUNCH. IN FACT, I YIELD. WELL, IT DOESN'T MAKE VERY MUCH DIFFERENCE WHO SAYS IT. DAN'S ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU A DIVORCE. I DIDN'T TELL HIM TO DO THAT. NO, IT'S HIS OWN IDEA. BUT HE APPARENTLY HAD REASON TO BELIEVE YOU'D GO FOR IT. THEN WHY DID YOU COME HERE, PETER? TO HAVE YOU ASK ME FOR IT YOURSELF. I SEE. \h[ Horn Honks ] THAT'S OUR CAB. I'LL BE OUTSIDE. [ Door Opens, Closes ] DAISY, WE NEED A FRESH START. LET'S GO TO NASSAU. LET'S GO SOMEPLACE WHERE WE CAN RELAX. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, BABY, BUT WE'VE NEVER GIVEN OURSELVES A FAIR CHANCE. IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO REALIZE IT, BUT I KNOW NOW WHAT I WANT. I'D GIVE UP EVERYTHING FOR YOU, BABY. [ Scoffs ] AS A MATTER OF FACT, I PRACTICALLY HAVE. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHE GIRLS? IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO END THE THING. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE. I COULD HAVE GONE ON. I TOLD YOU. YES, BUT I COULDN'T STAND WATCHING WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO YOU. NOTHING WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT I COULD LET THEM TEAR YOU TO PIECES LIKE THAT. AND IN THE END, IT WAS WORTH IT TO FIND OUT WHAT I REALLY WANTED. LUCILLE WOULD HAVE CALLED OFF THE WHOLE BUSINESS... \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAND GONE BACK \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTO WHERE YOU WERE. BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. CAN IT EVER BE TOO LATE FOR ROSAMUND AND MARIE? DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? IT'S ALL OVER, THAT MARRIAGE. IT CAN'T BE OVER AS LONG AS THE CHILDREN ARE A PART OF IT. MARRIAGE DOESN'T BREAK UP THAT EASILY. IT'S TOO LATE. IT'S EVEN LATER FOR US, DAN. YOU SAID IT TOOK YOU A LONG TIME TO REALIZE WHERE YOU STOOD. ME TOO. BUT OUT THERE JUST NOW, WHEN THE CAR WENT OFF THE ROAD, THINGS SOMEHOW GOT MUCH CLEARER. IT'S A FUNNY THING ABOUT BEING IN LOVE. SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER TO TELL WHEN YOU ARE THAN WHEN YOU AREN'T. I STOPPED BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU A LONG TIME AGO, DAN, BUT THE-- WELL, THE MEMORY KIND OF LINGERED ON AND KEPT ME MIXED UP. WELL, WHATEVER YOU CALL IT, LOVE OR ANYTHING ELSE, IT WON'T BE OVER TILL WE'RE DEAD. WE'VE GOT TO KILL IT, FOR GOOD. I'M SORRY IF I LET THE MEMORY MIX ME UP. IT MIXED ME UP TOO, I GUESS. I WAS PRETTY SURE-- THE THINGS YOU PUT UP WITH FOR MY SAKE. IT NEVER WOULD HAVE WORKED. REALLY, DARLING. BECAUSE WHAT YOU CALLED WANTING ME WASN'T ANYTHING MORE THAN... WANTING TO RUN AWAY FROM RESPONSIBILITY, THE WAY YOU'RE DOING NOW. GOOD-BYE, DAN. GOOD-BYE, DAISY. GO AHEAD. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SAME AS YOU, HONEYBUNCH. GOING HOME. THAT IS MY HOUSE IN THERE, YOU KNOW. AND MY WIFE. [ Vehicle Departs ] PETER? YEAH, THAT O'MARA PUT UP A GREAT FIGHT. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT FIGHTING? WHEN IT COMES TO MODERN COMBAT TACTICS, YOU'RE BOTH BABIES COMPARED TO ME.
