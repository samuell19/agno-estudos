Is that Mr. Ares speaking? - Who is this? - Good day, sir. My name is Jeff and I'm calling from Atlantic Trust. I wanted to get the chance to make you the financial offer of a lifetime. How did you get this number? - I'm sorry? - This number is not for you. I just wanted to offer you this unique opportunity. What did you say your name was? Jeff, sir. Do you think it makes you unique to have your own name? Um, I'm not sure I understand the question. You're not unique, Jeff. There are nearly seven billion exactly like you. You're part of an overpopulated plague. Jeff, I want you to take into serious consideration - of killing yourself. - Why? Maybe you have someone close to you, but in the grand scheme of things, nobody would miss you if you were gone. Don't call this number again. It's not meant for you. I hate guys who look like that. It's so superficial. You don't need to worry about that, though. You look like a man in good shape. Don't call me that. Never mind. You're all right, man? Ares. -You all right? -What do you want? What do you mean, what do I want? I just bailed you out of jail again. So? Do you expect a thank you or something? That might be nice for once. Say what you want to say so I can get out of here. Fine. Look. This is the third time now. You made it really difficult for me to do anything for you. That said, we can't allow you any more financial aid unless you fulfill some requests. What request exactly? To start off, I need to put you on the support groups. All of you. You will be given counseling for an hour twice a week with one of the therapists. -You can't be serious. -You brought this on yourself. I can't help you unless you take part in the outreach program. Well, it's better than not getting money, isn't it? Probably not. Obviously, I can't force you. Those of you who come will continue receiving welfare. -So, that's how it is? -Yes. That's how it is. ♪ Every morning when I wake up ♪ ♪ I have this feeling inside ♪ ♪ Every day when I go walking ♪ ♪ It feels like something has dried ♪ Hey. Did you put that bet for me? What bet? On the guy. The swimmer. You never told me to place any bets. Are you doing okay, Uncle? Getting old. You'll know when it happens to you. I'm over 3200 years old, you know. You're just a child. -Where are you going? -Fish food. I got you some two days ago. More.

There's a bad brace in the bed, I think. Oh, I didn't know. But I think I can get a hold of a thicker mattress -by the end of next week. -Oh, that's fine. I don't think I'll be around by then. Where are you going? Well, I just figure I'll get my own place as soon as possible. I told you, you don't need to rush. It's nice having you around again. Don't you think so? No, that's fine. I understand. Okay. Bye. - Hey. - Hi. So, how's the job hunting going? Still working on it. You know, we collaborate with the outreach programs on Wednesdays. Actually, just after you left this morning, I heard that they're starting new groups. Maybe there's some counseling work there. No, I don't think that's for me. Since last year, I switched to strictly freelancing as an in-house performance coach. What does that mean? That means they can't afford me. Hermes. Got a minute? I'd like a word. -I-- -Don't worry, it's good news. You've been here quite some time now. And you've proved yourself to be a very diligent worker. You have a perfect delivery percentage, and the amount of overtime you do is impressive, even though no one asks you to. So, anyway, none of this has gone unnoticed. Thank you. The point of the matter is that, as you know, Vivica is leaving in a couple of weeks and I'd like to offer you her position. It's a promotion. Can I still deliver the mail? No, this is a supervising job. You get your own office with a desk. And a chair. No, but thank you. Very well. That'll be all then. Well, um, actually, I wanted to mention something. Yes? I think that the organization of letters has been too sloppy of recent. I mean, I just found a letter going out to box 15282 instead of 15283. And a similar thing happened, like, two weeks ago. - Hermes. - Yeah? No one asked you to double check the sorting, okay? And two misdelivered letters in two weeks is no big deal. It's lucky I double check. It is. I mean, there's too much unprofessionalism around here. I mean, the mail is vital. It just can't-- it can't be ignored in this manner. Hermes... I think you and I need to have a little chat. - Who is it? - Aphrodite. Fuck. You were in jail yesterday? I got this from Dennis. What the fuck are you doing? You're fucking with our income. You don't always have to be the loudest about everything. This affects you the least. You can always make back the difference. Raise your prices or give your customers access to that third hole of yours. Hey. Athena. Support group? -They're cutting our welfare? -Unless we attend. Oh, okay. Uh. -Does it apply to all of us? -Didn't you get the same letter? Uh... - Seriously? - Yeah. Uh, I must have put it somewhere. Um, somewhere. Why do you keep all of this shit? You don't need any of it. We must support the mail service, all right? Here. I found it. Look, we have to talk to Dennis. This is ridiculous. Maybe we should just give them a swift kick in the teeth instead to send a message about messing with our lives. Anyway, I'm not going. I'm not sure how much of a choice you have. Still have my integrity. Actually, I-- I was wondering maybe you could just lend me some money, just for this rough period. Uh, I just got fired. -Fired? How? -Yeah. -Uh, politics. -People. Look, Ares. I know it's beneath us, but... I can't see how we-- I just can't afford to lose more money. Kara Miller. Kara with K. Okay. It's always interesting that companies who claim to have nothing to do with each other always seem to have time to gossip about employees. Nothing. Never mind. Thank you for your time. Eloise! Kara? Did you say something? What was the name of those outreach programs you mentioned? So. I'm not going. It's not that I want to. Anyone of us who has a drop of self-respect left would tell them to shove this letter in deep places. Hermes seemed like he's going. You spoke to Hermes before me? Well, like I said, those of us with self-respect. Oh, you are so damn worried about everything. That's easy to say, but look where we are. I know you don't worry. You didn't worry when. You were busy partying during the Battle of Thermopylae. Look at how you're living. Maybe it's time to worry a little bit. Think about it like this. If something similar happened back then, what would you do? That doesn't even make sense. Obviously, I'd do whatever I want. And now you don't because of the consequences, right? So, why don't you outsource the problem? Outsource, to contract out jobs, services, et cetera. Get someone else to do the dirty work. I'm going to take a nap. Maybe the great Hermes can help you. What can I say? This is the most impressive CV that's arrived on this desk. I hope you understand that we have a very pressed salary budget. Honestly, I'd be surprised if you could earn a tenth of what you've been declaring the last year. That's fine. Giving psyche evaluations to executives can be more boring than it sounds. So is that the only reason why you're sitting here? Honestly, I made a bad decision. I trusted a colleague with an under-the-table investment and I ended up losing a lot of money for myself as well as embarrassing the company quite a bit. Did you ever make bad decisions with your patients? No, definitely not. I was often referred to as the best motivated they met. Look, you are clearly highly qualified, but there's more to this job than that. Such as being open minded. Kara, do you believe in the occult? The supernatural, the unknown? I'm not sure, uh. The spirit world to some extent. Why? Kara, I'm looking for therapists for a very special support group. - A project near my heart. - Okay. You see, the members of this group all know each other. They suffer from anger outbursts, alcoholism, poor self-esteem, among other things. Diverse group. Yes, but there's another catch. They're all fallen Greek gods. What do you mean they're gods? I didn't say that. I said they're fallen gods. There's a vast difference. That sounds odd. It is odd, I know. But the important thing for me is to find a therapist that can let go of the odd nature of the situation and solemnly focus on the work at hand. Because despite a lot of early efforts and all their time around other people, they still desperately need help adjusting to society. Kara, do you understand the situation? I think so. The jobs yours if you want it. Okay. Thank you. I want you to understand that they don't have any personal wish being here. I've starved their welfare situation. And if they want to continue to see money, they have to come to meetings. They don't see themselves as us. We're the enemy. - Who is it? - Ares. I come in peace. I just want to talk. -Are you armed? -No. It's about something that concerns both of us. It's open. Sit. You wanna do the support groups. Yes. I've been summoned, but you and me are not going to be in the same group. That's what I mean. You've been summoned by people. Doesn't that bother you? You know they're gonna try to take your globe away from you. Try to heal you. Say you don't need it anymore. No, they can't take my globe. I need it. It's the only comfortable position after holding up the heavens for all those centuries. Also, this is a reminder. I didn't come here to fight. I'm not angry anymore. I was looking for Zeus for a long time. To get my revenge. But, I didn't find him. I've come to realize that being forced to hold up the heavens, that was just my task. No matter if the Titans had won the Great War or not, it was always my task. This globe is a reminder of my importance and my power. And no man will take it from me. You and me, we've always been treated like the ignorant ones of our kind. Ares, the god who can only use force and no smarts. And Atlas, who got fooled into slavery once again. By Heracles after being freed. Well, today... you and me, we're going to show that we are capable of great things. We're going to make them regret that they ever angered us. -Come. -Yeah. No. No? I've been speaking to my fellow gods and since we did what we did to you in the past and the fact that we need you now. We want to give you the honor of doing it yourself. Huh? Hm? It should be no problem for you. And it will be remembered that on the day the humans tried to rise more powerful than Titans and gods, only the Titan Atlas could stop them. Huh? Yes. Atlas did it. Yes, yes. Yes. It's 200 more than last time. I told you that on the phone. What more do I get for that? This isn't a buy one, get one free deal. It's a bit much. It's as much as Angelica takes. Angelica? Yeah. She's nice. She's younger. I like you, you know that. It's just 200 more is too much. Look.

Kind of like going from having your own six room apartment to sleeping on your sister's foldout bed. You've been doing your homework. How's it going? Well, I've been reading up on some of the things you suggested. And how does it feel? Well, it's a strange situation. Usually is. I've been trying to find out what links them in common. Apart from the obvious. Anyway, I think most of the personal addictions are related to them not being able to move on in their lives. So this is how you want to approach this? Maybe. I don't know. I haven't met with them yet. - Well, it could work. - Dennis! Atlas. What on earth are you doing? Kara, meet Atlas, former Titan. Hello. Why did you attack us? I must stop your people's control over us. For the sake of both Titans and gods. I don't think our British friend here is a collaborator in this. Who asked you to do this? Never mind. I don't need to hear from you. I want you to go home and think about what you've done. Look at me. We're going to talk about this later on. Understand? Sorry for the interruption. That was quite an interruption. I feel like dealing with this right away. Could we talk about this later on? Absolutely. Athena, you're supposed to be the smart one around here. You will have to start to understand that this was best for you. I won't fight about it. I'm only going to make things more difficult. You can let the others know that the sessions have been expanded to two hour periods. I'm pretty sure you can thank Ares for that. You know, you're a fucking idiot. Listen, we can't bend to their will. -We need to set an example. -Where's Dionysus? Look, they can treat us however they want. Ari, where's Dionysus? He's not here, don't fucking know where he is, okay? Listen, we need to stand united on this. Look at us. We used to be the ultimate creators at one time. Now, they've forgotten what we've done. We shouldn't. This is beneath us. Ari, I agree with you. Okay? But we still need money. We've handled falling out of divinity. We can handle a small financial crisis. Hey. I got you some food. How are you? Tired. I didn't get you the brands you wanted. We-- We need to cut back a bit more now. Do you need help with anything? I don't know. The fish needs to be fed. And you? I could use something to eat. How about you feed the fish and I'll feed you. Hey, Uncle. Uncle. Hey. Get up. Hey. Relax. Relax. Okay? Someone will be here soon, right? Like I told him, as soon as they can. Thank you, ma'am. Come on. Come on. Ma'am? It's ma'am now, is it? -What? -What the fuck happened to you? Wha-- why? Because I believe in treating them with a little respect? It comes back around, you know. It's actually quite fascinating how you could have been around for so long, but not learned the absolute most obvious thing about them. They have no morals. They're never grateful of anything. Yeah. Look at them. Shouldn't be all that surprise though. You didn't have to deal with them the way we did. Flying around from God to God. Not the same job as having to interact with people. Oh, right. So you interacted a lot with them, did you? -Yeah. -You know, leading them into battle against each other, sometimes joining in. And cutting off their head for good sport. Nevertheless, interacting with them. Right. Yeah. Okay. I'm sure that you're an expert in-- in, what, human psychology? Okay. By the way, if you were, you will know the classic term that you catch more flies with honey than fire. What? Look, if you just could be a bit more respectful to that nurse, there's more chance she'll go an extra mile to help Poseidon if necessary. Okay? It's all about attitude. I just told you, they're never grateful, so why bother? And you don't catch flies with fire, you idiot. It's vinegar. -Whatever. It used to be fire. -How can it be fire? How the fuck do you get flies with fire? Well, first, you light a fire, right? They fly into it and they burn. - That doesn't make any sense. - Yes, it does. Fire works. Well, not as good as honey though, because honey, it's more of a stick-- -sticky thing. -They're not-- they're not even comparable. Honey and fire. What if you, you know, make one of those big forest fires? Don't you think that kills hell of a lot of flies? Yeah, but only because of its size, but if you spread honey across the whole of the Earth, that would catch even more. -Catch. Okay. -Spread honey across the field. Yeah. Are you the family members of a Mr. Poseidon? -Yes, that's us. -What's the problem with him? I'm sorry, I'm not a doctor. We do, however, have a problem. It seems that your uncle is uninsured. Yeah, but, do you have some sort of payment plan or we can make ourselves responsible for any costs? We can arrange something. Though, without any form of insurance, this can get quite expensive quite quickly. Okay. Do you have some idea of how much it will cost? There's a per day price for the room, as well as costs for different tests and procedures, but it's still too early to say exactly. You can come by the reception before you leave and we set something up. Where's the doctor? Someone will be with you as soon as they can. Someone has to say it. - Those bills. - We'll handle them. Come on. We all know what we need to do. Hi. Hi, everyone. Uh, please have a seat. So, um... my name is Kara Miller. I'm going to be your counselor. I thought that we'd start with introductions and then I'm going to tell you a little bit about what we're going to be doing here. Okay. So... Aphrodite. Okay. I assume you're here for the sake of the money. I'm going to have to mark the ones of you that are present. So, if you could please say, "Here," when I address your name so I can make sure you get the credit. I'm Aphrodite. I see. Thank you. Athena. - Hermes. - Here. So, you must be Dionysus. I'm sorry, did I say something to offend you? You as a person offend me. I didn't mean to say anything. 67 battles won. Over 1400 slain. Conqueror of giants and creator of thieves. Here I sit. And you don't know my name. Ares. I know you don't want to be here. Any of you. But I want you to know that I am here to help you. What makes you possibly think that you could help us with anything? Have you ever seen this world from the outside? You say big things, but... your frame of reference is so far off from us that you couldn't even begin to understand us. Not during your lifetime, at least. Tell me, have you ever accomplished anything of significance? I can't say that I have. She can ask anything she wants. She won't get anything of value. It sounds simple and stupid to me. You know, one of you will fall soon. And you know who. Hermes. -You know why? -Come on. He has become habituated to our situation. Habituated, become accustomed to. Maybe sometimes I-- I also get the feeling of that. He doesn't really understand things the way you and I do. But he's still there when you need him. He doesn't understand. I don't mean he's all bad, but he will definitely be the first one to accept this. It's his weakness. Too focused on being like people. I can see through him. Checkmate. How does she look, this therapist? -Like a person. -Like a person of lust? Look. I need-- We need you to contribute to Uncle's medical bills. I'll give you some money. -How? -I've still got a couple of wine bottles. Turn of the century stuff that I can offload for a decent amount. I would like each of you to explain to me the importance of what your divine tasks were. Do you want to add to that, Ares? Do you really think you can outsmart us with earthly games? You don't care at all of what or who we were. Ares. You're right. In truth, your past doesn't interest me much. I'm interested in your future. I still think that you can live a better life than you are doing right now. And I think that you can still accomplish things. Perhaps other things than in the past, but still important. And I believe that you will feel the better for it. Your past is however, clearly important to each of you. So try to make me understand it. Aphrodite. Almost everyone on Earth finds love an important attribute to life. Why is that? Because it's personal. It's the emotion that connects your consciousness to your soul. Love is the only thing that can make the world survive. Very good. Anyone else? Athena thinks. Athena knows. The more important than any emotion is knowledge. Wisdom. The ability to learn is the ability to harness any emotion into an action. Without it, there is no progress. Emotions felt or ideas thought are worthless. All right. Now, we're talking. Hermes, did you want to add to that? Yeah. Gift of messages. Communication. It's the most important thing people have ever received. Without it, what's the point of wisdom? Communication is the physical action of sharing anything. Whether it is knowledge, hate... love. They are useless without communication. Thank you. Thank you all. That was very interesting to hear. What about me? I'm sorry, I was under the impression you were not interested. Well, I fear that yet another person might fall into the ignorance of believing what these have said is true. - And it isn't? - No. War. That's the most important gift humans have ever received. Okay. Please enlighten me. Love. Communication. Wisdom. They're all instincts that are shared with the animals. Not war. Their will and ability to divide up and wipe each other out in huge numbers over politics, religion, greed. It's what differs you from the animals. It's what truly makes you human. Okay. Thank you, Ares. Next time, I would like you to bring an item here. What kind of an item? Something that's important to you. The one thing that you would grab from your apartment if it were burning down. Are we five year olds now? You want to conduct show and tell? I'm trying to get to know you, Ares. I want to understand your values. Show me what's important to you. Please. - You still haven't found them. - Not the red ones? No. Can I borrow a pair from you? You have a pair of black ones for work. I haven't had a date in 11 months. Thank you. I really appreciate it. That's fine. Is that for work? No, I'm looking for flats. I see. Any good ones? Guess that depends on one's definition of good. So, Athena, why a stick? A branch. Sorry, a branch. It's not just any branch. It's from the olive tree I placed in Athens. The gift of the olive was the reason they named that great city after me. Wow. Thank you for bringing it. So, we have this. We have Aphrodite's collection of wedding invitations. Hermes has some letters that mean a lot to him. I guess there's only one item left. Ares, what's in the box? This... is my trusty avenger. Is that dried blood on it? Not just any blood. This is the blood of Halirrhothius. Divine blood. All it took was one swift stab right here. Do you consider yourself victorious? Look around this room. We suffered a heavy defeat. But we're not done for. Not yet. This war isn't over. Ares, why do you hate us so? Your kind stopped believing in us. A god can't be a god without belief. You robbed us of our purpose. So if people took your divinity by losing faith in you, then their faith must have given it to you in the first place. Isn't it only fair? Fair? Kara, the word you're looking for is betrayal. What you experienced happened a long time ago. People change. People do change. But not for the better. Look at what you've done to this place. You're too much for one god to handle. This was honorable. A way of settling who deserved to live. Now, your so called warriors sit in a box and press a button and watch their enemies burn. They're so comfortable with it that one day they'll press all the buttons and the entire world would burn. You're nothing more than savages. And you desperately need to be governed. So you think you'll be divine again? I figure that's the reason we're still around. Is that how you all feel? Kara? -Yeah? -Times up. Yes, it is. You recognize him? Uh, I think I saw him yesterday, here. He lives in Atlas' building. -Well, there we go. -That's not what I mean. It feels like we know him. -I've never met him. -You sure? I'm sure. Hey. This thing looks different every time I see it. Sometimes I remember things differently, so I see them that way. You think this line is correct? I think they might have been standing differently. You remember it that well, do you? Well, we were on different sides then. And our memories are not the same. I remember the blood. Me too. I'm only focusing on the first day. It's easier that way. So, when is it done? Don't know. I might make another one. Maybe Marathon. Do you remember that one? - I remember the blood. - Me too. Keeps reminding me. If they only knew how dispensable they all are. I'm going out with one. You're going out with what? I'm meeting one for dinner. It's like a date. With a person. I want something more, Ari. Hi. May I come in? I don't usually make house visits to my patients, but... I don't usually get a written cry for help either. How did you know it was me? Matter of deduction. There aren't that many of you. No, there aren't. So, Athena, what's on your mind? We need help. Yeah, I know that part. Why? I've been trying to keep together all the information, but it's a lot. A lot happens in a few thousand years. Everything we've done, everything we've seen. Don't you think it's important? What happened to us after we fell from divinity? What happened? We kept falling. I seldom at the sun in. What? I guess it reminds me of Apollo. Ares was there. When he did it. He tried grabbing him, but wasn't strong enough to hold on. There are a lot of suicides on here. It's difficult for most of us. Kara, you must understand. We were gods. And like I said... we need help. Here you go. -You're welcome. -Thank you. So do you guys want anything to drink to start out with? Uh, yeah, just, uh, lemon water. -Lemon water, thank you. -Mm-hmm. -Um, I would like, um, iced tea. -Iced tea. -With, uh, peach. -Peach? -Mm-hmm. -Perfect. -I know what I'm having. -Yeah? Um... -What? -Uh, souvlaki Looks good to me. I'll have that too. I-- I don't eat Greek food so often, so I'll trust you. Oh, really? Well, you'll-- you'll develop an appetite for it then. Yeah. Sounds like you're a fan. Uh, well, generally I'm a fan of Greek culture. Oh, why is that? I-- I think they've had good ideas, you know? -Yeah? -H-- have you been there? Oh, yeah. Mainly when I was younger. And since then, I lived in a lot of different places and um... it's-- it's been a bit complicated. There... are a lot of complicated things about you, aren't there? Um, like what? Like how you don't have an email address, although you're on an online dating service. Um, yeah, right. I-- I try to avoid email services. Why-- why is that? Well, I think it's killing the traditional mailing system. Is that important to you? Yeah, very. Yeah, uh... All right, so one iced tea for the lady. Thanks. -Here you go. -Thank you. So, you guys ready to order? Yeah, uh, two souvlakis. -Two souvlakis. -Please. Thank you. Perfect. -Thank you. -Thanks. . Oh. By the way. That's... an interesting trick. Yeah, I thought of it since you mentioned on your profile that you were looking for, you know, more magic in your life and that was sort of magic. Yeah. I'm a little bit different. That's okay. You know, I like it when-- I like the honesty of people showing who they really are from the beginning. Uh, well... there's more about me than what I've said. I'm Hermes. I know. No. Hermes, the Greek messenger God. I was divine. I could even fly. Though I should admit that my wing boots and hat probably helped. And those were some great boots. A-- anyway, um... I-- I didn't only deliver messages, but also human souls down to Hades. That's the truth about me. That's-- that's who I am. How about you? So, you think you're a god. From Greek mythology? Uh, yeah. Yeah, well-- well, a fallen god. -Yeah. -Yeah, look, I know I am. Besides, mythology is only a religion that's on a bit of ice at the moment. ♪ Some folks think you're happy ♪ ♪ When you wear your smile ♪ ♪ What about your tribulations ♪ ♪ And all, all of your trials ♪ ♪ Smiles ♪ ♪ Smiles hide a lots a things ♪ -Hey, Kara. -Hi. So, Ares. How's your week been? Okay. Athena, did anything unique happen to you this week? No, nothing at all. Hermes, anything happen this week? Well, actually, um... I was on a date. With a woman. Really? That's great. How did it go? Well, not so well, actually, um. Are you fucking kidding me? First you embarrass yourself by trying to date one of them, then you explain your failure in it to another one. Have some fucking self-respect. Shut up, Ares. If he's trying to find love, just let him. This isn't about you and your matchmaking ideology. This is about respect for us and our kind. What do you know about my ideologies? Aph, don't make this about us. What happened? I was married. Against my will, to Hephaestus. My affair with Ares was just an act of rebellion. My husband found out. So once when me and Ares were getting it on, he... trapped us and showed us off to the rest of the gods. Naked. Embarrassed. Ares basically got known as the stud that banged the prom queen. I was known as... There's more than one downside to mortality. You know, this is all right. Ares. Fuck all of you. I told you. That's okay. You made a mistake. But now you know. As you may recall, there was a reason we needed to go. There still is. I'm really sorry I'm late. Um, Kara. Though we could appreciate the effort, this isn't the most factual book. Well, let's discuss it. Uh, in general, how... do you feel that your personal history has been recorded? Do you mean authentically or promotionally? Which do you prefer? Look, those books aren't exactly well written biographies of us. They're more comparable to tabloids. She's right. People are very lazy when it comes to fact. They rather make a piece of art because they find it more fun. Exactly. And also you can't trust all of those portraits and statues either. I mean, they don't have correct proportions. They don't. Why are these dates here then? That states how long a period the bill covers. And that fee? That looks like a late penalty fee. -It's 7%. -Well, I'm sorry, sir. I can't help you with this. You'll have to speak with reception in the morning. I have to continue my rounds now. Sorry. What you doing? Not much difference? Hey. -Listen, Ari. I just wanna-- -Look, look. Just here to collect the money for the medical bills. Got it? Yeah. - So? - Hm? The hospital bills. I need a few more days to get you my share. Things are a little tight right now. Di, I haven't seen anything from you. What about these wine bottles you were speaking of? Di. You know, it was a long time ago and I might have drank one or two. It's your move. Look at me. I saw him. They got tubes going into his arms and all sorts of things. -Di, we need money. -So what? You're asking me to go to the meetings? Look, I'm not saying you should take in anything she says. We just need to swallow some of your pride like I already have for our fellow god. He would do more than so for you. So, how're they doing? I don't want to say too much, but I think they're warming up a bit. That's good. Good to hear. Dennis, what's up? Kara, we're having a few setbacks with the financing. Keeping certain groups up and running. My group? I don't understand. We just started this. Trust me, I know. But there's a certain budget in the outreach program that has to be met, and we've got to spend it responsibly. Look, there's a lot of people out there that need help and that won't help. Does this mean you're cutting their welfare as well? No. They won't be touched. I'll make sure they're covered. As I was. Then, it's me. Kara, it's hard... motivating spending money on group sessions for ancient gods who don't want anything to do with us. Especially someone who just walked out the front door. What? There's more to this group than just Ares, you know? Did you know that Dionysus is coming in today? That's very impressive. It is. You seem to doing a great job. You are. And I'll be more than happy to accept your job application for some other group in the nearby future. -Hopefully by next year. -I'll do it for free. I'll do it for free. They're accepting my help, and I want to give it to them. Just provide us with a room, okay? Deal? Hi. Hi. I'm Kara. I'm glad you came. Unfortunately, we don't allow alcohol in this room. In the building, actually. It's nothing to worry about. It goes where I go. But I guess I could leave. My sense tells me I should make an exception this time. Kara, I've been thinking. This room could use some warmth. It's so bland. It doesn't represent us. Actually, not to jump the gun, that's exactly what I want to speak about today. You want to talk about decoration choices? I want to talk about renewal. Evolution. She's a Darwinist. You've been taking advice from a Darwinist. I'm talking about the future. Your future. And I don't want to talk about becoming what you once were. I'm speaking of the state you're in now. What do you want out of your life? We all know what Hermes wants, don't we? And that's exactly what I'm talking about. Pursuing a relationship is an amazing achievement. It's-- it's not that simple. Being who I am. I just can't find someone on the same page as me. Well, it's never simple. I'm talking about your choice. Whether you see it now or not, it is progress. And Hermes, trust me. If there's anything I can do to help, you just let me know. Is there anything you have thought about doing? No matter how small. A project? A job? Anything? The most important question you can ask yourself is, "What do I want?" Athena, what do you want for yourself? Kara, it's not that simple. We were gods. We need to make sure our legacy is protected before anything else. Come on. You're a thinker. I know you've thought about this. All that knowledge. What do you want to do with it? Maybe one day, I could think of passing it on. Teaching it? Perhaps. Kara. You have to understand something. When we fell, we really fell. You know, it's a scary thing knowing how fast one can fall. But it's not as near as terrifying as not knowing how to get back up. Because when you've been down long enough, things around you start to change. And you start to change. Life has a funny way of engulfing ideology. I would like to not get paid for sex. But sometimes my need for desire takes me to bad places. Damn, you got some issues. Dionysus, I want you here, but if you're going to make a mockery out of this, you can leave. Relax, young lady. I respect my fellow gods. In fact, I'm hit by inspiration. I, too, have a dream. Is that so? It's been far too long since I practiced my histrionics. Hm. Histrionics. Dramatization, performance. I would like to set up a play. Are you being serious? As serious as when I gave Midas his choice of power. All right. Well, you're in luck. My sister works at a local theater that has a previous relationship with this institute. See? Belonging to this group has some advantages, doesn't it? I've been avoiding coming here, Kara. But now that I have, I'm thinking that Midas, , still have a trick or two up their sleeves. We were meant to meet, Miss Miller. That was quick. I managed to get a little bit of it up front. I see. - What's going on. - With what? What are you doing? Preparing. Prepare, assemble, make ready. I know what the fuck preparing means, Di. What are you preparing? A little project of mine. Kara's helping me. You're messing with me, right? I think you missed some of the potential of your group meetings. But it's not too late for you. I'll show you. It's a play. My play. And it's going to be epic. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, Ares. What? So, this is what you meant when you kept telling me to trust my instincts and to do what I've always done? Because this seems very different. Ari. Have faith. -He hates me, doesn't he? -Yeah, probably so. But don't take it personally. He's Ares. Hate is in his nature. Come in. Have a seat. Is it really that simple? Well, you're the therapist. You tell me. No, thank you. I'll just keep it here in case you change your mind. I don't know, this group, it's... interesting, but it's difficult. Interesting, but difficult. And what about you? Are you interesting? I guess that depends on one's definition of interesting. She's interesting. I don't think you'd find me interesting. Hm. Too bad. Let's get back on track, hm. Well, I've started brushing up something from myself. I've spoken to the theater. They're on board. Excellent. Now, it's the people we need. That's what really matters. The audience. The theater actually offers free shows some days. Usually, some people come in during those nights. Perfect. So, when do you want to start? As soon as possible. Don't you need time to practice? Kara. Therapist. Former god of wine and... theater. Right. My apologies. Okay. Showtime, as they say. Sure you're not coming? I would have really like to, but, um... I made other plans. Okay. Break a leg. I know you always do. What is that? I never say thank you to you. I don't know why. Uh, maybe it's 'cause you're my baby sister and yet, you're the one always looking out for me and everyone else and... Honestly, I'm a little ashamed of that. Uh, that's no excuse. You do so much for me, and yet I never say it. Um, I'm sorry. That's okay. I know you mean it. Something's come up financially. I thought I'd wait a little with the apartment. And I was hoping I could hang out here for a little bit longer. Of course. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey. Feeling ready? Since all eternity. A few people started to drop in. I can tell. I can smell them. Look, do you need a hand with anything? I mean, if you want, I can pull up the curtains for you. There's an automatic timer for that. Oh, technology sure moved fast this last century. I gotta say. -Hermes? -Yeah. What do you want? Look, I know we had our differences, okay? But, I just want to say that I'm proud of you, doing this. And I'm glad that you found some peace with our situation. Peace? Yeah, acceptance, or whatever you want to call it. That's the difference between you and me. You've grown weak and tired, and you've forgotten your roots. I will never accept the situation. Ever. Once I am divine again, I will show people how their meaningless lives are meant to be lived. What are you talking about? What about renewal? - Evolution? - Evolution? Yeah. I'm a god. I've always done what I'm meant to do. Nature has accepted it as its natural course. Those creatures out there failed us. They were weak of heart, and they stopped believing in us. Dionysus... it's in the past. - Okay? - Look out there. I have a crowd now, listeners, here for me and my wards. I created theater. Once they see the creation god performing his creation, oh, they will believe. And that's how it starts. I will rise again. I can feel it already. So, what is all this, huh? What? A charade? Means to an end. Something you, never understood. I fear it is too late for you to understand. But I will. I just have to show him the way first. He will adhere. Adhere, to join, unite, remain devoted. Many thought... that mighty Dionysus was only the patron guard of wine. This evening, you will see, he was much, much more, including the creator of theatre. Oh, I feel I will not endure. The agony is too prodigious. My demise is upon me. Dionysus, I shall eternally commemorate thy, my closest acquaintance. Master. I have brought you the rudimentary prescription. This is horrible. It's just awful. What's that? Shut the fuck up out there. Hey, you suck, man. Fuck you. You lizard bitch. Oh, my God. You psycho. You will watch me in silence and all. -Take that. -Fuck you. Get off! Fuck. Like, I'm ashamed. Yeah, I don't care, let's go. Though I am not one of you, I feel your pain. I feel the pain of another once divine being lost. So few we become. On behalf of the Titans, we extend our greatest sympathies to you and your kind for your loss of Dionysus, patron of wine. What makes you think you're welcomed here? He came to your session. -He took your advice. -Ares. - Now, we buried-- - Ares, that's enough! You should leave. Both of you. Please, get out of here. Ares, Ares, calm down! Calm down, okay? It's not your fault. Listen, Dionysus was the same, okay? He was obsessed with being divine again. That's all they cared about. Fuck her. Fuck you, man. You and your attitude, you're weak fuck. You rather defend a person than a fellow god you know for thousands of years, huh? Fucking traitors, all of you. Do you really think people can understand how suffering? They caused it! They caused it! Or did you already forget, huh? Dionysus was right. You've all gotten weak. Weak. You. Where's your fucking globe, moron? The one you needed so much. Yes. The funeral was a mess. Ares was right though, we have become weak. I don't think our family can survive Dionysus' death. It's going to tear apart what's left of us. Please, Uncle. How do I keep us together? All I can say is that we must use the time we have. Nothing lasts forever.

Former Greek god of war. I know who you are. Do you know me? Not 'til a second ago. And it seems obvious now. I'm not going to have any trouble with you, am I? Come in. That's a nice one. Thank you. Original. Circa 1910. A gift to the great god, Odin, I presume. I've been given a few myself. No, nothing so spectacular, unfortunately. In fact, I bought that one only a few weeks ago off a collector. Must be nice to be able to afford nice things. Well, Ares, I work for a living. -Counselling? -Right. I talk to refugees and war vets. People who have seen blood in their days. We're gods of war. What have they possibly seen in comparison? We've been through some things, you and I, haven't we? We have. Which is why we have the power to help them. So, since you have an income, why stay in this shitty neighborhood? I like the company around here. You better give me some good work. Kick his ass. Nah, you know, losing my shirt over here. Watch you head,. So... - We've dealt a new hand. - Yeah. Like I trust you, fox. No way. All right. Ares. This is Shango, former god of thunder and lightning to the Yoruba people, among others. Atlas usually joins us. This is Amaterasu. Japanese goddess of the sun. And this is Quetzalcoatl. Who? Quetzalcoatl. Uh, creation god to the Aztecs. And? And, uh, god of the sky, the water, the wind, rulership, merchants, priests. Uh, anything else? We heard about Dionysus. From all of us, our deepest sympathy. Thank you. So... you all play cards together? We do more than that, Ares. We support each other. It's rare to have others around you that know you and understand you so well. We are lucky. Odin. I remember a time when we moved mountains, made the rain fall and the sun shine. Created legends. Then, almost overnight, it feels... we went ahead and changed an entire belief system with no regard to us. Now, I eat broth with rye bread three times a week. I don't know about you, but I don't feel so lucky. Don't you think all of us have been through the same shit? Feels like the only thing that has changed is my abilities. I'm still on a battlefield every day. And I'm alone. Surrounded by enemies everywhere. And right now, I don't know how much longer I have the energy to stand and fight. Don't go down the road, Ares. It doesn't lead anywhere good. And if Dionysus was here, he would tell you himself. Listen to him. Ares, you're in need of freeing your mind. It's out of your hands. We've had our chance. Yes, we were once blessed with divinity, but now, you've been given a much more precious gift. You've been given life. So, that is it. Ares... You are right, you know. Life is a battle. The struggle to achieve our goals before our time has come. To find our place in this world. And as in any battle, there are crushing defeats along the way. It isn't filled with quick fixes and fairytale endings. And it isn't a fight against some physical enemy. You can slay anyone to become victorious. But the only way to lose it... is through surrender. And as for allies go... they're all around us. If one chooses to accept. I didn't expect them to show up. I just wanted to be here. Just in case, you know. I know. I want you to understand that I don't blame you for what happened. What are you going to be using this room for? A Tourette Syndrome group. As I mentioned before, I do think you have done a tremendous job here. I wouldn't mind having you on staff full time. But I do however think that you should definitely take some time to collect yourself. Are you joining us? Uh, no. I was just leaving. Have a good session, all of you. Thanks. - How are you? - Sorry. God. Welcome. We didn't drink. He didn't drink. But, um, then he introduced-- introduced-- Wine? So, where did he find it? He made it. Yes, I-- I expect you to mark me present. Of course. So... I was just looking at this building. I do that sometimes, I-- I watch them. This is a good one. Well structured. And... I think to myself that I could... probably design something like this. Help bring it to life. I think I would like to study architecture.
