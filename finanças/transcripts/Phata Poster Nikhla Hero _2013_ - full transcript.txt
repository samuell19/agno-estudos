There's bad news. Napoleon's coming to Mumbai. Interpol's sent us some photographs of Napoleon. Take a close look at these photos ..and recognise him well. Did yöu get a good look? Good! Smuggling. Drugs. Terrorism. Napoleon takes contracts for all these. According to the information received from RAW.. ..He's coming to Mumbai soon. To execute a dangerous mission. And his mission's called 'Mission White Elephant'. We've to thwart 'Mission White Elephant' at any cost. And we've to catch Napoleon alive.. ..And make Mumbai police proud. And.. Let's catch him first. Guru. How did yöu like mom's cooking? - Fantastic. I say let's get some for dinner as well. Hot vegetables. I'm eating yöur cooked food after so long. Feels so nice. But, mom. It would've been so much better ..if yöu could stay for few more days. Why did yöu come for just three days? Yes, son. I was thinking the same thing. Water. But, mom. How can yöu stay back here? yöu've things to do back in the village. - Yes. No, son. When yöu're insisting then I'll stay a few months with yöu. Yes, yes. Of course. But.. - Mind yöur duty, sir. How can yöu stay back? Three days later yöu've to leave with the CM for three months. For security reasons. - Yes. No. I'll refuse the CM. I'll tell him, "My mom's arrived from the village, so I'm slaying with her". Right, mom. - Duty comes first, mother later. Don't worry about me. I'll come visit yöu again. She's saying she'll come visit yöu again. Good morning, sir.. Evening? Afternoon, sir. - yöu called? yöu sent that inspector again, Ghorpade.. ..To beat-up my men. Sir, I've told yöu before. He's not one of us.. - Lying again. Why don't yöu just say how much money do yöu want? I don't want money, sir? - So? Do yöu want property this time? No, sir. I mean...l don't know who the inspector is. Sir, that inspector thrashed us really bad. He jumped kicked us. He made us run for our lives, sir. Look. He thrashed them so badly. He beat Madan black and blue. - Sir, I'm Mohan. He's beat them up so badly. yöu can't make out who's Madan, who's Mohan. We're going back to our village, sir. See, Ghorpade. Half of them are heading back to their village.. ..And the other half are in the hospital. Mission White Elephant is in its final stages. Sir.. - Either yöu drag him here by his foot or his hair.. ..But bring him to me, or else I'll skin yöu alive. What? Director Anees Bazmi's given an appointment? Yes, Anees Bazmi. - Great, Guru. I'll be right there. Just don't let Anees leave. - Who is Anees? Anees is a very big movie - Movie? Don. He's a don. Just like there are dangerous villains in films.. ..Similarly, they are real life dons. We finally managed to get a grip on them. I mean, find them. So...I'll go make a plan to catch him. Give me yöur blessings. No need to worry. I've found out everything. Joint commissioner Khare's home is undergoing repairs. So he's rented the ground floor of yöur home for a month. That's it. Guru. If that joint commissioner sees me in uniform.. ..He'll throw me in jail. That won't happen. Just do as yöu were doing until now. Acting Silence. Hello, sir. - Hello. My son's a police inspector too. We live on the upper floor. - I see. Yes. He just joined the police force. He's closed down many bars and gambling dens. - I see. And he beat up some criminals so badly.. ..That the other goons fled the city hearing their screams. What's his name? Vishwas Rao. He's after some Don.. Yes. He's planning to apprehend some don called Anees. Anees? Anees Ismail? That dangerous don. He's planning to catch him. Then I would like to meet him right now. What? - Yes. yöu're laughing. The commissioner's waiting for yöu downstairs Mom, yöu got fooled too. yöu're so innocent. He's no police commissioner. He's not the commissioner. He's an actor. - Actor? He used to work as a commissioner in TV serials. One day he suddenly stopped getting work.. ..And lost his mind. Then? - He went mad. He dons the police uniform and sets out on the road. He goes and sits in any police station that he sees. Oh Lord! - Lord, have mercy on him And he's been kept here for treatment. - I see. And those people around him, in uniform, are crazy. - What? I mean they're actors. They're acting so that he feels he's the commissioner. But why? - Because the doctor's said.. ..This is the only way to treat him. And the doctor's also said keep his illusion intact. - Why? Because if his illusion shatters, then he can lose his life. Heart-fail. Son.. Son, we won't shatter his illusion either. yöu've got to act in front of him as well. Mom. yöu know I can't act. Try. - Okay, mom. I will. Only for yöu. My mom's.. What? That's why I.. Look, first speak then cry. Or first cry then speak. Don't speak and cry together, Inspector. I am not an inspector. - What? And this uniform? - It's rented. I've worn it to keep my mother alive. What's this story? - It's a sad story. My mother loved watching films. One day she went to watch a film. The story of an honest officer and his mother. Suddenly, the fan above fell on my mother's head. Oh, my God! Then what? The fan stopped, but my mother lost her mind. Oh no. - Oh yes. Since then she thinks I'm a police officer. And I wear this uniform in front of her. But what do the doctors say? They say this is the only way to treat her. Keep her illusion intact. - Why? Because if I take off my uniform.. ..Then my mother will lose her life No, no. Keep this uniform on. We'll keep yöur mother's illusion intact, Vishwas. Inspector Vishwas. Mr. Commissioner, she's my mother. Yes, we've met before. Mom, he's the Commissioner. My son really praises yöu. He says yöu're a big television - Mom.. Television? I mean, there's no other police officer like yöu in this city. Yes. And I say, yöur son acts so well.. Sir.. Act? - I meant active. He's the most active inspector in our entire department. Right, Vishwas? Inspector Vishwas. Mr. Commissioner, do look after yöurself. yöu shouldn't go out on the streets wearing this uniform.. - Mom. Alone on the streets? I mean, yöu should keep yöur constables with yöu. - Yes. And yöu should watch fewer films. - Sir. I don't watch films. I do. I watch lots of films. Just a minute, madam. Just come with me. - Yes. Vishwas, what is she saying? Television serial? Don't roam the streets? I'm confused. There's no confusion. It's simple. Really? - yöu're not the joint commissioner. What? - For my mother. But yöu are, for me. - Thank God. I'm a police inspector. - But yöu said yöu're not. For my mom, sir. But I'm not, for yöu. And.. - I get it. I understand. I'm the joint commissioner, but I am not. In yöur mom's view. And yöu're not a police inspector, but yöu are one. In yöur mom's view. And mother's a mother after all. But she isn't, in whose view? A mother's always a mother, in everyone's view. Sir, yöu're so.. - Yes. A mother's always a mother. There are bigger malls in Mumbai. Hello, sir. I was looking for yöu. Sir. Hello. Who is she? She's my mother. - What? Sorry. Are yöu my mother? Vishwas. She's my mother. - Aunt. Bless yöu, dear. Who is she? - She's a girl. I know that, but who is she? She's a girl, and.. - Kajal. She's Kajal, mom. Whenever anything bad occurs in the city.. ..yöu will find her there. What? - Aunt, let me tell yöu. I'm a social worker. Whenever I see anything wrong happening in the city.. ..I'll inform the police. - Great. yöu do the right thing. And I'm here with a complaint right now, aunt. For him. Sir, Paradise club at Gol Chowki.. ..Deal in every kind of illegal drugs and business. I just found out that ..some juvenile girls are being held captive there. Oh God! - Yes. Let's go Let's go lodge a complaint with the police. - What? I'm the police. I'm the police. But that isn't my area, Kajal. So, go lodge a complaint with the area's inspector. Go fast. I did go there. - yöu did. But inspector Ghorpade isn't ready to listen. He isn't? - No. - Forget the area. Go, go with her. And free those girls. Go. I can't go, mom. I.. - Hold this. Dear, which way? - Aunt. At Gol Chowki, there's a.. - Quiet. Hold this, mom. Let's go, mom. Come, Kajal. - Come. 100 million in cash. Anything special? - It's very special. All this money is for 'Mission White Elephant'. Remember. Gundappa sir has said, "Be careful". Don't worry. This is one of Gundappa sir's safest places. No one can come here. - Good. Let us go! What a club! Till now I only saw them in films. It's the Abode of Gods! Rambha. Menka. Urvashi. They're all here. They are not girls, they're vanilla ice-cream. Sir. What are yöu staring at? I wasn't staring. I was thinking, girls like yöu shouldn't go to a.. ..Club like this to see such cheap dance. We should leave right now. Sir, we're not hereto see the dance. We're hereto free the girls. Inspector! - Don't yöu know that.. The police are not allowed in this club? So what are yöu doing here? Just taking a stroll around. Just like that. It's nice. - No, it's not. We're hereto conduct a raid. I'm a reporter. And I've information that ..yöu've held some girls captive here. Bring them out. - Hey, girl. What nonsense. Calm down, Kajal. Calm down. Sir. Are yöu scared of fighting? No, I'm not scared. I enjoy fighting. yöu see, Kajal. If they injure my face my career will be over forever. What? Let me talk to them. - yöu will talk to us? yöu will talk to us? Bachchan Singh! Muktar. Balbeer. Baktawar. Kallan. Why call so many people to talk? This is how we talk here. Just mind yöur own business get something to eat and get lost. We're hereto teach yöu a lesson. This inspector is a bulldozer without brakes. Once he starts he doesn't stop. I see. - Move aside. Shoot him! "yöu don't know.' "yöu don't know who I am." "yöu don't know.' "yöu don't know who I am." "Naughly eyes-" "Silky arms." "Sexy body." "yöu...yöu...yöu...yöu..." "yöu don't know.'

Police conduct a raid at Gundappa Das' Paradise club. On the orders of Gol Chowki police station's.. Senior inspector Ghorpade.. ..One of his yöung officers, didn't just thrash the goons.. ..But also rescued some juvenile girls And confiscated millions of rupees. Ghorpade sir, what would yöu like to say? Me? I am sorry, sir. What do I say? I don't know who did it. I just arrived recently. How much is this? Who told yöu? Kajal, what are yöu doing? What if it starts raining? The doctor's asked yöu to keep the wound dry. It feels nice. Of course, all the girls were rescued. Except for one. - What? No, they all ran away. I saw it myself. Why are yöu laughing? - Just like that. Only crazy people laugh without a reason. I can't see a rickshaw around either. If it starts raining, we'll be in trouble. That'll be even better. I don't know, but everything seems nice. I'm injured, but even that feels nice. Madam. Did yöu hit yöur head? Have yöu lost yöur mind? I grew up alone. I was very yöung, when my parents And, I never ..had a kin. Today, for the first time It felt like...I've a kin. "yöu're the dream." "I'm the slumber." "Together we make up the night." - I am always with yöu. "Every day I pray...that our wishes are fulfilled." "Our wishes are fulfilled." "I'm the colour of syrups." "And yöu're the sweet of river." "I'm the colour of syrups." "And yöu're the sweet of river." "Together...we can make up our story." "I'm the colour of syrups." "And yöu're the sweet of river." "I'm the colour of syrups." "And yöu're the sweet of river." "Slowly, calmly, I've woven yöur dreams together." "..with my slumber." "I don't want the earth, or the heaven." "All I want is yöu in my life." "yöu're the saga of love." "And I'm naively." "Together...we can make up our story." "I'm the colour of syrups." "And yöu're the sweet of river." "I'm the colour of syrups." "And yöu're the sweet of river." "yöur thoughts are the only place I want to be." "yöu mean everything to me, always did."

"And yöu're the sweet of river." "I'm the colour of syrups." "And yöu're the sweet of river." "Together...we can make up our story." "I'm the colour of syrups." "And yöu're the sweet of river." The cash that I sent for 'Mission White Elephant'.. Was confiscated. Why? - Yes, sir. There's a police inspector ..who, for no reason...always.. Sir, I've seen that inspector. And...soon I'll find him. Finish him. And be careful. RAW and Interpol are keeping an eye on our movements. Look. We won't discuss this any further. I'm sending yöu the entire information of this mission.. Through an agent, on a CD. And make no mistakes. I'm arriving next week. Okay? I have left for the station. What's this crowd for? - Don't know, madam. I will miss my train. Hire another rickshaw. - Okay. What is my mistake... let me go. Let me go. Don't beat me. Someone help me. - yöu lodge complaint. Come with me. - Leave me. Let me go. What is my mistake... don't beat me. Leave me Someone help me. - yöu lodge complaints. Come to the police station. Someone help me. - Leave her. Mom.. - Don't call me mom. Don't call me mom. yöu've humiliated yöur mother, not just this uniform. Why didn't yöu just die. Why didn't yöu die? What's going on? Get her out! Get her out! She's my mom. There is shooting going on here. There is shooting going on here. Listen to me, mom. Drive away this madwoman from here. Move from here. Don't touch my mother. Don't touch my mother. Listen to me, mom. Mom.. Mom.. Mom! Someone get me a rickshaw. Someone get me a taxi. Someone get me a rickshaw. How's mom? Don't know. I'm not a police inspector, Kajal. I was only lying. I lied to mom as well. That's why she Mom will be fine, Vishwa.. "I know...I'm lonely." "How can I live...if yöu leave me?" "Don't stay silent, say something." "yöu can scold me if yöu like." "yöu can scold me if yöu like." Will yöu do as I say, son? Of course, mom. I will. Will yöu deceive me again? No, mom. Never again. Forgive me. What do yöu want? Get me...some poison. I don't want to live. Don't say that. Don't say that, mom. I'll never do anything wrong again. Never again. yöu acted so well. Even...yöur mother couldn't recognise yöu. yöu'll be a good actor. No, mom. I don't want to be an actor. I want to be a police officer. An honest police officer. I don't want to be an actor. What are yöu doing inside? Please go out, it's not allowed. Look, her condition's critical. She needs complete rest. Doctor, will my mother be okay? - We can't say right now. Please leave. yöur mother will be fine, Vishwas. She's just shocked. Because her dreams were shattered. When yöu were one year old.. yöur father was a cruel officer. He would take money from the rich.. ..And do their dirty jobs for them. 'Savitri. Don't interfere.' 'She's a decent girl, let her..' 'I want to teach a lesson to this decent girl's father.' 'That girl's father, Shashtri owned a factory..' '..which was the only means of earning for the villagers.' 'The rich men wanted that land.' No, inspector. Don't do that. I will sign. 'Helpless Shashtri signed on the papers.' 'The same night both father and daughter committed suicide.' 'People were furious, they set out to kill yöur father.' 'I've told yöu before, slop these illegal deeds.' 'The curse of these poor people..' "..will never lel us live happily.' 'If anything happens to yöu..' 'The same old thing. The same old lecture.' 'I made a big mistake marrying yöu.' 'I admit yöur father was an honest policeman.' 'But how did he die? A pauper.' 'I don't want to die like that, Savitri.' 'Everyone has to die one day.' 'Everyone does.' 'But the question is how does one live.' 'If yöu want to live then come with me.' 'They can..' Listen. There are his wife and kid Finish them! Stop! No one will lay a finger on them. I will break yöur heads. yöu will save them! Our curse will finish Yashwanl Rao's family. We won't spare them either. We left the village. - Both mother and son will suffer. And yöur mother swore.. That she will repent for yöur father's crimes. By making yöu an honest police officer. And people will sing praises of yöur honesty. It will restore people's trust on policemen. That's why I named yöu Vishwas (Trust). Mr. Vishwas. Dr. Vinod Khanna's calling yöu. Vinod Khanna's turned a doctor? What? But he's always been a doctor. Come. - I see. So, he was acting in films just like that. Stop thinking about films, Vishwas. Vinod Khanna can be someone else's name too. Come on. yöur mother's in a bad condition. We'll have to perform surgery. It'll cost around one million. One million? Deposit the money soon. We don't have much time. Start preparing for the surgery, Doctor. I'll get the money. Somehow. yöu are under arrest. For posing as a cop. My mother's very ill. I've to arrange for one million for her surgery. I am sorry! Come with us. Come. Tell me, sir. Where are yöu taking me to? To us. Who said that? I...am Gundappa Das. But why bring me here? yöu need rupees one million. We'll help yöu. Why? Why will yöu give me the money? Because yöu will do a job for us. Look. I won't do anything wrong. No one pays one million for doing anything good, son. Hello. - Dr. Khanna, here. yöur mother's condition is getting critical. And yöu haven't paid the money yet. No, sir. I'm trying, sir. Please understand and do something fast. I'm trying. I want rupees one million. Tell me the job. A cultural dance troupe ..has arrived in Mumbai from Hong Kong. Our agent has sent a CD through them. They're performing a show today. yöu'll go up on the stage during the show.. Collect the CD and bring it here. But any of yöur henchmen can do this job. The security there is tight. And it's impossible for any stranger to get in. Then how will I get in? The chief security officer for the show is Bhimsingh Thappa. And we had kidnapped his girl.. ..And yöu rescued her on Link Road. 'I am Suman Thappa..' '..chief security officer Bhimsingh Thappa's daughter.' Both, father and daughter think ..yöu're an honest police officer. So with their help, yöu can easily get on stage. "I'm the bird that soars in the skies." "Beloved...yöu are the fruit that dangles on earth." "I'm the bird that soars in the skies." "Beloved...yöu are the fruit that dangles on earth." But.. "The heart's...definitely crazy." "It jumps up and down." "But it's always in the best mood." "One, two, three, four, five.." "Do the crazy dance." "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." "yöu've an iron body." "yöu've an iron body." "My heart's like magnet." "My heart's like magnet." "My heart.." "My heart's like the magnet." "I've cancelled all others." "yöu're my true lover." "yöu're my true lover." "My lover. " "yöu're my true lover." "Pleased in a moment, shuts up in the next." "My heart's technicolor." "Changes in a moment." "But it's always in the best mood." "It always counts one, two, three, four, five.." "Do the crazy dance." "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." "Crazy, crazy...crazy, crazy dance." "Always talks lovey-dovey." "Every time my sweetheart shakes her waist." "Drums play." "I'll pick every lock." "Because yöu're my key." "Everyone's here to see this charade." "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." "Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance." - Stop. Vishwas. Catch him, Ghorpade. Vishwas! Vishwasl What have yöu done? yöu killed two policemen. Give me the gun. yöu were supposed to keep the police engrossed. How did they come here? I don't know. Come to yöur senses, Vishwas. The car's here. Run. Run! Vishwas killed two policemen, sir. What? That's good, Ghorpade. Now Vishwas has no other option ..and we've a new lifetime gang-member. Yes.. Kajal. Yes, Kajal. How's mom? Mom's not in the hospital, Vishwas. She's not in the hospital? We looked everywhere, but can't find her. Very good. Very good. Boys... - Where's my mom? Mom! She's right here. And she's perfectly alright. Don't worry. She's absolutely fine. She didn't need any surgery. She only had blood pressure ..and we controlled it with medication. So, why did yöu lie to me? I told him to. Because I wanted yöu to do this job. This is our gang-doctor. Just like a family doctor is called family doctor ..similarly, I am his gang's doctor. What's this nonsense? yöur lie ruined my entire life. I killed two policemen today, and yöu.. Calm down, sonny. Calm down. yöu asked me for a million rupees for surgery ..which I am giving yöu. To heck with yöur money. Where's my mom? She's in that room. She's angry with yöu. yöu killed two policemen. I had to tell her. yöu? Get out of here. Go away. I don't want to see yöur face. Listen to me, mom.. - I don't want to hear anything. I don't want to hear anything. Just go away. Just go away. yöur mother's dead. yöur mother's dead. Just go away. Go away or I'll kill myself right now. - No, mom. Just go away. Just go away. - I'm going. Go away. - I'm leaving. Just go away. yöur decision isn't right. Once yöu join the gang, yöu won't have a way out. Let's go and tell the police - No, Kajal. Mom's in their captivity. yöu won't tell the police anything, Kajal. For my sake. But, Vishwas, how is this - Just forget me, Kajal. yöur world's full of bright life, hopes. My world's filled with darkness and nothing else. We cannot be together, Kajal. And.. And? And what? Say it. We won't meet again. I'm sorry. "Without me.." "Without me.." "Without me.." "Without me.." "Without me yöu'll be happier." "Don't let my thought ever cross yöur mind." "Without me.." "Without me.." "Without me.." "Without me.." "I wonder where yöu're headed.." "..leaving me at two ways." "yöu gave me happiness.." "But yöu snatched it from me." "What did yöu get.." "What did yöu get.." "What did yöu get by making me cry?" "Don't let my thought ever cross yöur mind." "Without me.." "Without me.." "Without me.." 1000 kilos of cocaine, will be delivered tomorrow afternoon ..to the special chamber of the Versova warehouse. The computerized lock will open.. ..Only through the CD that I sent yöu. Collect the consignment and keep it in yöur warehouse. I'm arriving day-after-tomorrow. Same place, same time, where I always land. Good bye. That's Napoleon sir's mission. White elephant! 1000 kilos of cocaine! Hands up. No one moves. Load it. Load it. Load the goods. Get down. Get down. Jesse. Lock everybody up. Lock everyone up. Lock. Lock them. Lock. Jesse. Call the area in-charge and call them here. I'm taking the truck to the police warehouse. Vishwas, yöu? Vishwas. Sir.. How did Khare get there? They're policemen; they're bound to get there. But why did Vishwas go there? Didn't yöu tell him not to? He's a novice. The commissioner must have arrested him.. ..And he must have blurted everything. And the police must be on their way here. We're dead. - Saved. Here's yöur enemy, Joint Commissioner Khare. And I've delivered yöur truck loaded with goods to yöur warehouse. Ghorpade. - Yes, sir. yöu here? - I work second shift here, sir. Aren't yöu ashamed? - I am, sir. Well done, Vishwas. Well done. Napoleon sir will be very pleased with yöu. To heck with yöur Napoleon. I'm doing this for my mom. My mom's suffering here. I want to take her back to our village. How can yöu go? The entire Mumbai police will come here.. ..Looking for Khare sir. They won't. - Why? Because he'll inform his department.. That he's going out of the city for a few days.. ..And they shouldn't look for him. - No, I won't. What? yöu will. yöu will say it and also help us. Will yöu say it or not? Speak. - Yes, I will. I will. Good boy. Tie him up. Take some lessons from him, Ghorpade. Take some lessons from him. Why are yöu tying up this poor man? Tightly Look, he's no police officer. He just likes to roam around in uniform. He's a television actor. I know, I know. There's no television in yöur room. That's why we brought this actor here. Now watch him perform. Listen Madam. I am actually the joint commissioner of police. Let it be. Get yöurself treated by a good doctor. No, try to understand. Madam. These gang members ..were forcing Vishwas to do a wrong deed ..by making the excuse of yöur illness. That's when he came to me. I won't do anything wrong again, sir. I've a suggestion, Vishwas. - Yes, sir. Just like Gundappa said, collect the CD.. ..And deliver it to him. Do they pay yöu too? - Oh shut up! I want yöu to join Gundappa's gang. That means they definitely do. Hey, sit down! I've a plan. This way we can eradicate Gundappa and his gang. And that's why.. ..I want yöu to execute this job and enter his gang. I want yöu to join their gang and extract information.. I got it, sir. Just like Amitabh Bachchan did in 'Don'. Right, sir? Yes. And if yöu do that, they will pay for yöur mother's surgery. She will receive treatment. And yöu will join their gang and work as a police informer. I will work for the police? My mother will be really happy. Sister, for yöur happiness ..Vishwas agreed to do policeman's job. While doing this job, yöu will kill two policemen. What are yöu saying, sir? Not really. Fake bullets. Fake deaths. This way Gundappa will start trusting yöu. And he won't kill yöu, instead he'll let yöu join his gang. What an idea, sir. No one can imagine that yöu can think so well. Thank yöu. What did yöu say? - See yöu, sir. Stop. - What now? Vishwas, keep this watch. Whenever yöu press this button ..a light will blink on the other watch. After that, regardless of where we are.. ..We can talk to each other, through this watch-phone. Now watch. I'll talk and yöu listen. - Sir. Hello, Vishwas. I've entrusted yöu with the job.. ..Of a secret agent for the Mumbai Police. yöu'll have to do this job with great responsibility. Are yöu listening? Of course, sir. I'm with yöu, sir. yöu had to stand there and listen over the watch-phone, idiot! Where are yöu going? To stand there and listen, sir. Vishwas. Sir.. Will yöu be able to do this job? Of course, sir. I'll do it really well. Okay. Then keep this phone. - Thank yöu, sir. But I have a phone. This isn't for making calls, Vishwas. When yöu press this button twice ..it will give out a blinding flash.. ..And severe everyone's vision for a while. This will help yöu when yöu're in trouble. Wonderful, sir. yöu just turned me into James Bond, sir. Why did yöu press the button now? I was testing it, sir. yöu could've told me so. I would've closed my eyes.

This mission can't be completed without this bag. Find that traitor. Otherwise, I will kill all of yöu. Sir. I doubt someone. yöu doubt me? Me? I could've been arrested as well. I could've died in the police firing as well. How could yöu forget Gundappa sir.. ..Who risked his life to bring yöu that CD? Me. I had to kill two policemen and I didn't hesitate.. ..Just for yöur CD, Gundappa sir But yöu still doubt me. Me! Hello, aunt. yöu here? These goons abducted yöu too. They can't abduct me.

He took the mother along. Sir, he's written something here. So read it. "The food here is really pathetic." "Please change the cook, Joint Commissioner Khare." Fool. - No, sir. He's absolutely right. I've complained about this too. The food's really pathetic - Shut up! Sir. Inspector Jesse reporting, sir. What's the news? Gundappa's den is empty, sir. What? They've fled. - Keep informing. Yes, sir. This isn't cocaine, sir. - What? It's powder. Are yöu sure? - 100% sure, sir. Yes, Vishwas. Where are yöu? Sir, we've escaped from Gundappa's den. - Very good. We've escaped too. And mom? - She's fine. And Kajal? I sent Kajal to meet up with yöu. Yes, she's here too. She's with yöur mother. Both are under police protection. Listen to me. Napoleon's tricked us. That truck wasn't filled with cocaine. It was some bogus powder. That means 'Mission White Elephant' is something else. Sir, whatever it is, it's in a black bag. And that black bag's with me. - Very good. Get that bag to Crime Branch Special Unit Zone 8! That's where I am. - Yes, sir. I am not a policeman, but Napoleon's man. Hello. - We've abducted yöur mother. Get that black bag back to Vasai Fort in one hour. Once yöu're there, I'll give yöu further directions. yöu've only 60 minutes. If yöu try to act smart, yöu will never find yöur mother again. Seal the entire city. Set up check-posts. - May I come in, sir? Come, Vishwas. Vishwas, there's bad news for yöu. I know, sir. Napoleon has kidnapped my mother. How did yöu know? He just called, sir. He said, "if I don't return him this bag in an hour.." "..he will kill my mother". Here, sir. Yet yöu brought this bag here. Mom always said, "Duty comes first, relations later". So, I've done my duty.. ..Now I'm going to save my mother. Wait, Vishwas. Go give them this bag. Sir? - I know we lagged in protecting yöur mother. But now Mumbai Police will do its best in saving her. Go. - But, sir, this bag.. Trust me, we will handle everything. Now go fast. I kept the police engrossed with cocaine. And diverted their complete attention on yöu, Gundappa. And quietly, cleverly fixed bio-chemical weapons.. ..At four important places in the city. That's my real mission. Mission White Elephant. Bio-chemical blast! An RDX blast kills only those that are in proximity. But a bio-chemical blast will also kill those who are safe in their homes. Because bio-chemical is a liquid. It will turn into gas right after the blast. And spread a dangerous, incurable disease through air. In the entire city. yöur son, my enemy's here. Savitri? yöu...are still alive. That means... Vishwas.. I... I looked everywhere for yöu, Savitri. yöu're dead for us. - No. No. Don't say that, Savitri. Look, once again we're yöu, me and our son.. - Mine. Vishwas is my son. Only mine. yöu've no relation with me. I do, Savitri. We share blood ties. And even yöu can't change that. yöu've the bag, Gundappa sir. yöu can punish me in any way yöu want. But let my mother go. First let us complete our mission. Mission White Elephant. This bag contains a computerized detonator. Once it's connected with our computer ..it will trigger numerous blasts in the city. And people will rot to death. Rot to death! Yes. Take a left after one kilometre. Take a right after three kilometres. Sir. I've set the timer for the bio-chemical weapon. I've the set the timer to 20 minutes. All the bombs will explode in 20 minutes. What happened to the tracker? Just a minute, stop! yöu informed the police. Now yöu and yöur mother will have to die, Vishwas! No one moves. Or I will shoot. Shoot me. Don't move. I said... I will shoot. Shoot me. That's the punishment for a sinner like me.. That I die.. ...By the hands of my son. What is this nonsense? Fate ..has played a joke on me, son. I.. Savitri.. - Don't utter my mom's name. My father died when I was a kid. - That was a charade. I can't believe my eyes either. After all these years.. Ghorpade. - Sir. Switch on the monitor. "yöu're still alive " "That means... ...Vishwas.." "I searched... everywhere for yöu, Savitri." Give me a hug, son. I've yearned so long for this. I don't want anything else. Just stop the police. I will go with yöu and surrender myself. So that yöu become famous. My son becomes famous. That's my request. That's all. I want additional forces. Send the backup immediately. Vishwas. Yes, Vishwas. Sir, Napoleon's ready to surrender. - What? Stay there. I'm bringing him to yöu. OK. Thank yöu, son. I...missed yöu a lot, father. Why did yöu leave me? I am sorry, son. I am sorry, I made a big mistake. I made a big mistake. Sir, yöu're a fantastic actor. Even I was deceived for a moment. Just imagine, sir. Even me. Hello, Captain. Keep the chopper ready. I'm arriving in an hour. - OK. Right now. Get ready to leave. - Yes, sir. Gundappa. - I am coming. I... What's wrong with him? Sir, there's another one there. Sir, there another one. Hey girl. What are yöu doing? Nothing much. I just deactivated all the bombs.. That Gundappa sir had activated. That's it. - How did she come out? I brought her out, papa. For helping me. But.. Vishwas? yöu might be my father ..but I'm a better actor than yöu. yöu put up a charade.. ..So that yöu can cause blasts in the city and flee. And I put up a charade, so that ..l can stop the blasts and apprehend everyone. So, Napoleon. How was it? Cool! yöu won't survive either, son. Hands up! Don't move Throw down yöur weapons. We already did, sir. - What? yöu already did? - I made them do it, sir. Very good, Vishwas. Very, very good. Very, very bad. Because I still have my weapon. Come on, Commissioner. Throw down yöur weapon. Throw it. And, Vishwas. Throw down yöur gun too. Very good, Gundappa. Very good. - yöu see, sir. This commissioner's always out to get me. Hang on. - What happened? Take this. Take this. Save me! Save me! Save me! Save me! Ghorpadel - Yes, sir. What sir? yöu dare hit a policeman. What are yöu doing, idiot? Are yöu crazy? What are yöu doing? Oh my! Do yöu want to kill me? Ghorpade. Kill him. - OK, sir. Ghorpade. - Yes, sir. He's a policeman. Kill him. - Yes, sir. Ghorpade. - Yes, sir. He's one of us, kill him. - Yes, sir. Ghorpade. - Yes, sir.
