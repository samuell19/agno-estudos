Look Bequer, I bought this hat in Paris. It's been many years. It's a very elegant design. Don't you like it? You don't understand a thing about fashion, Bequer. What a pity, Bequer... There's no way to stop this plague. Look at my flowers... Remind me to spray them tomorrow. Come and drink your milk. Bequer, where have you been all day long? If you don't come when I call you, there'll not be a meal for you. Do you understand? Bequer, don't be such a naughty cat. Behave yourself. - When did you arrive? - Just now. Who's that in my bedroom? - What? - Oh, forget it. You lazy girl, get up. It's pretty late. - What a surprise! - No. You gave me a surprise. Can you tell me who's sleeping in my bed? She's a cousin of mine, poor girl, she didn't have a place to stay. I don't know what's happening. She's going to stay? If you don't have a problem with it... - Where is she going to sleep? - Any place, on the sofa or here with me. Besides, she can help us with the bills. She's a model. That argument convinces me. Come on, get dressed, let's go. Everything was alright with Octavio until I opened the door yesterday and saw... - A woman! - Two! His wife and daughter. - He must've been surprised. - He was just dressed in his underwear. What happened then? - I don't know. I just grabbed my things, acted innocent and left-. Did they give you a reference? No, not a single one. And I didn't do so badly. Well, just forget it. What's important is you already have a place to sleep. Ofelia agrees. I don't know how to thank you... Don't worry, we'll charge you for all future expenses. The rules of the house are: The first one going to work uses the bathroom first. I'm late. By the way, Ofelia. You didn't tell us anything about your trip-. The bad news is that it's over now and I have no prospects. - Ofelia, you're an actress? - I suppose you can say that... - What do you do? - I work as divorc√©e. As a vampire, she lives from the money she stole from her ex-husband. Here, I'm the one in charge of the administration of the house. In that case, bring me another cup of coffee and put it on my tab. Hi. What are you doing here? I need to talk to you, come with me. - Is something wrong? - I'm not sure yet. Look what they sent me. It's a solicitor's letter. You have to hear the Will. I want you come with me, these things alarm me. I'm afraid too. The house and all properties therein, will be placed under the care of my niece Miss Ofelia Escudero after my passing. - An inheritance? - A considerably amount of money. It's an old house but it has a lot of land and many valuable objects. But... I can't understand why aunt Susana chose me. I understand that you were the only family she had. So, it was by default. Oh, it doesn't matter! What's important is you inherited, like in a soap opera. One moment. These things always get odd with strange terms and conditions. Like marrying someone you don't know or adopting a child. Well, that's half true. See? I told you...- It's not as serious as you think. It's not as much a condition as a request. As an exchange for this legacy, l am calling on my niece's compassion... by accepting custody of the living being I loved the most in my life... and who kept me faithful company for many years, my unforgettable cat Bequer. A cat? As an exchange for a house, it's not too much too ask. - Who's this aunt Susana? - She was my mother's cousin. I barely remember her. I was afraid of her, she always scolded to me. Then, there was a family fight and I never saw her again. You don't remember anything about the house? Yes. There was a big chandelier in the lounge. And long stairways. I slid down the handrail when I was a child. There was a big clock somewhere. I loved hearing the striking clock. The entire house had a strange and damp smell of lavender. And it was always quiet. What impressed me the most was aunt Susana's portrait in the Lounge. - Not very modern, is it? - No, but it must have many bedrooms. That means servants, doesn't it? Why not? With the money we saved, we can afford them. I'm Ofelia Escudero. - I'm not sure if you know that... - I know. These are my friends, they'll live with me. As you wish. - We'd like to see the entire house. - My pleasure. This is the main lounge. That's the reception room. Is this the famous picture? What an impressive aunt! She was a very distinguished lady, if that's what you mean. - So many strange things! - Did you see this eyesore? That eyesore was a present from the Persian ambassador to Madam Susana. I was just saying it's odd-. Don't worry Miss. I understand your point of view. Modernism, has distorted people's tastes. - Do you want to see the living room? - Why don't we find out what's in the bedrooms? Yes, much better. Do you want to know when I'll go the Persia? Never. This is your aunt's bedroom, where she died. The notary told me she died of a heart attack while knitting in the lounge. That's true, but she was still alive when we brought her up here. Everything is exactly as it was before she died. What's in the box? Your aunt's ring, the one she always wore. Put it on. We should keep this room locked out of consideration for your aunt. I think that's a good idea. What? And waste this bed? She died here. - Then, she died very comfortable. - Why don't you keep this bedroom? I'd love that but Ofelia is her niece and she should stay in here. No, it's yours, if you really like it. If you want to, you can check the other bedrooms. Did you see this? A collection of rubbish. Watch out, it could be from the Turkish ambassador. - She got under your skin? - That old bat... Girls, I found an incredible treasure up there. The bathrooms are full of white clothes and towels. We've inherited a lot of things. I want to know if we're going to keep that horrible servant. Be careful, girl, the mummy can hear you. Did you see the kitchen? What a fancy oven. I'm going, that's my speciality. Wait, something important is missing. - Where's Bequer? - Of course, the cat. I have no idea where it can be. Since your aunt's death, it's been acting very strangely and is usually hiding somewhere. Well, I don't care. I hate cats in general. Tell me something, Sofia... ls it pretty? Your aunt said there wasn't anything prettier in the world. What colour is it? Black. Blacker than the night. Corny old woman. All this fuss over a flee-bitten cat. Don't complain. You got this house thanks to it. Oh! Listen to the prince consort. You're just defending that cat to please Ofelia. And I like it a lot. The problem is you suffer from Ailurophobia. What? Ailurophobia. Ailuro is cat, phobia is fear. Fear of cats. If that's the case, we're two. I hate cats. Except for the husband, there isn't any more ungrateful animal. - What are you doing? - Saving me the stairs. Martha is downstairs waiting... What happened? I get tired of waiting. She's odd! Everything is in the car now. Even a needle won't fit. - I'll have to do another trip. - Take this, there's room in the seat. Don't touch it! How dare you put your hands on my canary? - Oh come on, it won't die. - Yes, it can. Look, now it's trembling. Did the witch frighten you? Come to mother. This is cornier than Christmas with the family. Isn't he lovely? Yes, I hope Bequer get both of you married. You may not believe it but Bequer's absence has me worried. I hope it gets lost permanently. Don't say that, they'll take away our inheritance. The Will didn't say that. But I feel morally responsible. Ofelia... what if instead of living in this museum, you sell it. - You could buy a flat. - And lose this? Never. In the future, when there's more money I could sell and buy something more modern. I'll leave you with your projects, and go to sleep. Me too. I carried boxes like a longshoreman. Sessions over. Does the Will force you to keep the mummy? No, but what can I do? Embalm her. - Curtains will look nice up there. - Still awake, Sofia? I have the habit of turning off the lights and winding up the clocks every night. You'll tell me if you want me to keep doing it. No, no... It's alright. - Sofia, did Bequer show up'? - Don't worry Miss. The cat will come back. I think moving here, will complicate things for you. Because of Roberto? I'll phone his office tomorrow to tell him where I'm living. For a divorced couple, you've got quite a good relationship. Not at all, my dear. I'm interested in him sending my money. Admit it, you still want him. Yes, at the bottom of the sea with a stone around his neck. If I were you, I'd patch things up. You're complicating life too much. What's wrong? I don't know, something strange in the air. - Don't you notice? - It smells of lavender. It wasn't so intense in the morning. Don't start with your imagination or you won't be able to sleep. Can you turn off the lights? - Did you hear that? - Who screamed? it's Bequer. That's why you screamed? It scared the hell out of me. Damn cat. Be careful, it can scratch you. - It's afraid. - And with a good reason, he found Pilar in the dark. Very amusing. - Did something happen? - Yes, this rude cat entered the room. It still believes this is her master's bedroom. It has always slept in that rocking chair. - How did it come in? - Through the window. It's open. Madam Susana ordered to take off the grills so Bequer can wander around freely. I'll fix that tomorrow. I'm not going to sleep every night with a cat! Not every night but tonight you don't have choice. We'll see... Get out of here! Get out! I don't recommend you do that. It'd spend all night meowing at the door. She's right. Forget about the cat, lie down and get to sleep. - It won't be easy but... anyhow. - Let us go to sleep - Please. Enjoying yourselves? You slept like a log and I didn't want to wake you. With last night's little party I could hardly sleep. Think what you want but I'm happy we found Bequer. I don't think it's funny. Me, for instance, I won't sleep in that bedroom anymore. Fine, I'll take it. We'll change places later. Now I want company to go through the cellars. Cellars? - Huge and apparently full of old rubbish. - I love seeing pieces of junk. - Where's the way in? - There's a door at the back of the house. Sofia gave me the keys. Did you see this? I can't understand how they could dress like this in the street. I can't understand how they could cover their bodies so much. Being virtuous was meaningless. What's the point in it? Just imagine undressing. - This fashion suits you very well, Pilar. - I suppose it's habit. These dresses are just like the ones my husband bought me. Hey, your aunt really knew about business. Look at this! That's why your aunt didn't get married? She didn't want to. She had a romance waiting for her first boyfriend. She has never worn that coat? What a waste. Would you dare going out dressed like that? Yes, some Tuesday's carnival. Why not? That'd be great. We can have a masquerade. Pilar and Sofia should go without mask. Shut up. Those are malicious words. That'd be for the front page or just for the cancan? - I think this is Lucia's Sunday dress. - No, hers are more cheerful-. You look like my grandmother with that hat. Yes but the way she's now in the grave. Girls, look what I found. - I'm sure something special is in there. - Let's find out. Damn cat! It frightens me. Bequer, get out of here. Don't be a nuisance. - Be careful, it's furious. - As if it owns that box. It'll pay for this. - Please don't hit it. - Oh yes I will - It's leaving now. Nice cat? Did it hurt you? No, it just took it to heart. - Let's see what's in that box, alright? - Fine-. - What a gorgeous dress. - It must be my aunt's wedding dress. - Didn't you tell us she wasn't married? - Yes but it seems she had it prepared. Maybe you can fix it and wear it on your wedding. That's true. It'll cost me a lot to buy a dress like this. They say wearing something old is good luck. That'd be done if you show up as the Maid of Honour. - I'll go to my room and try it on. - Come on. Bequer, what are you doing here? Come here, my dear. Stop playing games. Come here. Can we listen to something more soothing? No, that's why I brought my records. Would you prefer some of the aunt's? - Did she have some? - Of course she did. Bach, Chopin, Beethoven, Wagner's opera, Vivaldi. She adored them. I'm thinking on keeping the dress the way it is now. ls it alright? I think it's great. Do you like the idea of her wearing that dress? Of course. Of course, it saves him from buying a new one. Did he see you with your dress on'? That's bad luck. It also means being one step ahead of the wedding. We don't like that, little boy. These two mothers-in-law are watching you. Come here, Bequer. Someone's in the garden. - What are you talking about? - Someone's calling Bequer from the garden. - Did you see something? - Yes, looked like the shadow of a woman. Watch out, people. Aurora loves making jokes. No! I swear it's not a joke, I heard a voice in the garden. - I want to be sure about this. - I'll go with you. You'd better not be joking about this. No, I swear I'm not. There's nobody here. - Like I expected. - Let's go back, it's very cold. This is the first time they leave us alone. I'm not going to waste this opportunity. Did you hear that? Yes and very close. Wait here. Don't go. It's Sofia. I don't know why I didn't think of that before. Thank goodness... I was getting a chill down my spine. No, no Miss. It wasn't me. - I've been in the kitchen all night. - But we heard you, Sofia. I assure you. You're wrong. Besides, I have no reason to call Bequer. He always stays in the garden during the night. Unless we'd called him earlier because the clouds looked threatening. Rain? In this season? I'm just giving a report of this house's custom. Alright, you can go now. With your permission. I'm sure it was her. - Mad old woman, I can't stand her. - The good part is we're in good company. She's right about one thing: There's a lot of noise in this house. Oh, but you heard nothing yet. Let's dance, Pedro. I don't understand why she said she wasn't in the garden. You know...? I'm not so sure if it was her voice. - Whose then? - I don't know. I'm not superstitious but... it frightened me when I heard that voice. Can you believe this? It's raining. Who's there? Of course it was her. Neither of us could do it. I can't believe it. How dare this woman enter in my bedroom? Believe it. These old servants feel they've the right to do it. In fact they probably see us as intruders... - Did you want to see me, Miss? - Yes, Sofia. Tell me... What did you burn there, last night? Me? Look Sofia, I want you to tell me the truth. Yesterday, I found a wedding dress in the cellar. Someone took it away from my room and threw it in the fire. - Your aunt's wedding dress? - Yes, that one. I burned it myself. That's inexcusable. How dare you. Your aunt adored that dress. It was something very beautiful for her. I don't think you ever had such love for an object to the extent of treating it as something untouchable... and sacred. - That didn't give you the right...! - Of course not, Miss. I beg you to forgive me. - If you want I can leave... - That's not the point, Sofia. We'll talk later. With your permission. Why didn't you fire her? I'm not sure. Poor woman, she really loved my aunt. She's a hypocrite! Did you see her innocent face when you asked her? She almost convinced me. - But who else could it be? - Of course. But... How did she know the dress was in my bedroom? He looked so handsome. That damn cat did it... Bye darling, thanks for everything. Can we have lunch tomorrow? I don't think so. I'll call you at the office. Let me close it for you. Bequer, where are you? Who's there? It's me, Miss. I'm looking for Bequer. I didn't see him all day long. He didn't eat and that worries me. - Don't worry, he'll come back. - No. he won't if I don't call him. - He's frightened. - Why? Bequer knows when he behaved badly. Today, he did something terrible. He killed Miss Aurora's canary. Poor little darling... Marta. Wake up. What's going on? Listen... I don't hear anything. It already stopped. - What's wrong, Aurora? You're trembling. - Marta, the sobbing was horrible. - Come on, woman, you just had a nightmare. I heard it, I was awake. Then... I went to the corridor and... Someone was crying in the front room. - We can go see if you want to. No matter what, I won't go downstairs. I'm afraid. Did you hear something strange last night? - Weird? Like what? - Like crying. No. I didn't hear a thing. I'm sure it was the sound of the wind, Aurora. No, not at all. What I heard was crying. But Pilar and Ofelia didn't hear anything. Yes, that's very strange. Why only me? You better give up, I'm on fire tonight. Alright, I give up. - You're not happy. What's wrong? - You'll make fun of me if I tell you. He didn't come back, not even to eat. It's been four days now. I think we definitively lost him. Don't worry. He must be out there living a passionate romance. How wonderful animals are... He had a feeling he'd be scolded after killing the canary. Would It do you any good if I got a new cat for you'? I've become very fond of him. He was very pretty. And blacker than the night. - Don't make fun of him. - No, I'm truly sorry. - Do you want to come in? - Do you want me to? I'm coming in. Sofia's bedroom is at the back of the garden but I... What's happening? - We must tell you something. - You're not going to like it. What? - We found Bequer. - I was worried. Where is he? In the cellar... Dead. How could this happen? We didn't notice and we left it locked. It couldn't get out because of the barred windows. It starved to death. Poor thing... Don't get upset about it. I know it's sad but it's nobody's fault. We should get rid of it as fast as possible. Get rid of him? Certainly not! We'll bury him in the garden. Ofelia, that's nonsense. I don't care! I'd feel very bad if I didn't do it. We never treated him with respect. Fine. If that calms you down, we'll bury him tomorrow. I feel so guilty. - He must've suffered a lot. - Don't think about that- Let's go-. Alright. Fortunately, the Bequer problem is finished. Damn cat! Not even dead I'll forgive it for my canary. Let's go, Marta. What are you doing? Nothing. I'm thinking what aunt Susana would do if she knew. Who is it? Who's there? What can I do for you, Miss? - How dare you bring this here? - Bring what? This. Don't try to deny it. It seems cruel to leave him in the cellar, this was Bequer's favourite spot. You must be mad. It's just for tonight. Take out this rubbish right now. Do you understand? Done. Anything else? I hope you're not expecting we put up a tombstone? Don't make fun of me. I couldn't just throw him in a rubbish bin. Alright, we did it. Now, please forget about Bequer. I'm very sorry, Sofia. I didn't take proper care of Bequer. The house will be very different now. Personally, I won't notice the difference. I assure you Miss, you'll notice. Why did you apologise to her? She loved Bequer. I don't want her to hold a grudge against us. Hold a grudge? She hates us. The way she looks at us. Is that utter nonsense over with? Let me tell you, my dear, you don't have any feelings. You're a bunch of hypocrites. You're as happy as I am that the cat's dead. You're just making a good impression on Ofelia-. I can't understand why no one heard him meowing? Yes, it's weird that a cat starves to death so quietly. Enough. I'm fed up with the cat. You're going to drive me mad. - There's no other subject to talk about? - What's the problem, Aurora? I can't stand this. For a week it's been all you talk about. Where's Bequer? What happened to Bequer? This is too much. What's wrong with her? Who is it? - It's me, Miss. - Come in. What's that? - As you didn't eat this afternoon... - Thank you. Leave it there. Do you feel sick? Yes, I'm a little bit nervous. Did you hear those voices again? You must think I'm mad. Why? Because I'm a modern woman free of all this nonsense... and suddenly I'm hearing voices at midnight... but I heard them, Sofia. They were terrifying and blood-curdling. Horrible. If only you had heard them. I did. Sofia, help me please. Help me. You've lived in this house for so long, you know all the noises... there has to be an explanation. There is one. Do you believe in the afterlife? No. Of course not. Then you wouldn't understand me. If you hear them again... stay in your room. Are you going to stay much longer, Miss Aurora? No, Jos√©. I'm finishing. You didn't read any book, did you? - Why do you care? You never read them. - At my age? When would I finish them? It's not about reading all of them but the important ones. Reading all of them would be even worse, just imagine that. - I'm in the office if you need me. Drink it, Aurora. You'll feel better. I saw her. It wasn't my imagination. Believe me. You just said the caretaker looked in the library and didn't find anyone. But she was there. And then I saw the walking stick. I can still see it in my mind. I didn't know about the stick. Of course you did, you see it every day in that picture over there. No, I saw it. It wasn't the same. It was very clear. It's silver hilt shined. That stick never was in the library, I'm going to show you right now. - It's in the house? - Naturally. - It'd make you feel better if you saw it? - I don't know. Perhaps. It's all a product of your obsession. Ever since that night when you heard the voices, you can't stop thinking about it. Sofia, can you please bring us my aunt's walking stick? Don't look at us that way. We want the one she used. Not the one in her portrait. But... that's not possible. - She took it with her. - She took it? How? The day we buried her, I put that stick in her coffin. - What should I put in first? - The sauce first, then the almonds. Who taught you this dish? My grandmother. It was Madam Susana's favourite dish. You really loved her, right? She was a wonderful woman. Every person who knew her, became very fond of her. However, she never managed to get along with Ofelia. She was very strict, Miss. If someone crossed her, she never forgot. She didn't know how to forgive. You rest, Sofia. I go. - You? - Can I come in? Yes, of course. What message did you give the caretaker? He didn't explain it very well. One of you've inherited a house or something... Ofelia. This is her house. You're planning to stay here with your friends? I don't have to tell you about my plans. Damn! Don't be so aggressive. I'm just worried you live here, as if you didn't have a home. But it's the truth. You have ours, don't you? You never show up there. Well... that was before. I promise that if you come back with me, everything will be different. Look... I've thought a lot about us. You were right. - Keep your hands off! - I made many mistakes. I admit I left you alone because of my friends. But that's over now. Also, I admit I spent money when you needed clothes and other things but... Roberto, they can see you... Listen... we're not going to let anyone interfere with our lives. You know? I'm still in love with you. Roberto, they'll see us... I can't live without you. I need you. I promise we're going to be very happy. - And we're going to have a child. - But not here. - Look... It's Ofelia. - Yes, it's me. How strange, isn't it? Ofelia, what a surprise. - What a miracle... - How are you? He came to talk to me. - Then, I won't interrupt. - No! He was leaving. But you didn't answer yet. - I need some time to think about it. - Fine, as you wish. See you, Ofelia. And congratulations, very nice house. Ofelia, let me explain to you... It's not necessary, my mother did it many years ago. Don't think that I was... Pilar, it's your life and you can do whatever you want with it. We're going to miss you a lot. I've not decided yet. I don't know what to do. To start by buttoning up. Jos√©, is that you? Answer me. What are you doing, Jos√©? Turn on the lights, please. Is that you, Jos√©? - It's closed. - She works very late. Good night, I came to see Aurora. ls she still here? I think she's gone, there's nobody inside. That's not possible. We just talked on the phone and she said she'd wait for me. Alright, you can come in if you wish. See'? She isn't here. It's been quite sometime since I turned off the lights. Look! That's her purse. She's still here. She must be in some of the out-houses. I'm going to check. What a place. Where are the lights? What are you doing here? Nothing. Why don't you come with us? I don't want you to be alone. I can't stop thinking about Aurora. What could've happened? What they said: Her heart. but do you know what makes one's heart stop? Fear. What are you talking about? Fear of what? She had that fear for a long time, since that night when she heard those voices. And then the woman she saw at the library. That was pure imagination. You saw Aurora's face after her death. Those fixed eyes, wide open, full of fear... I've spent many hours here, where I keep asking myself... what could've been the last thing she saw? Sofia, Pilar said you wanted to talk to me. Don't you think it's a bit much to put flowers on a cat's grave? Why? That's what they do with all graves. - People's graves - It's the same. They are lovely beings that we've lost. Your aunt thought the same way. Alright. What did you want to talk to me about? This will be my last week at your service, Miss. Why Sofia? - Perhaps you won't understand my reasons. - Tell me, I've got a right to know. I knew Bequer's death would bring bad luck. And you already saw what happened to Miss Aurora. What does that have to do with the cat's death? Not with the cat. - I meant, with your aunt... - My aunt is dead. - Your aunt is here. - Please, Sofia. I don't know how you didn't realise this earlier. Your aunt's presence is in every corner of this house... I've heard her crying through the nights for Bequer's death... I've seen her wandering in the corridors, looking through the windows. You must be out of your mind. I knew you wouldn't understand me. But after I leave, you'll continue finding flowers on Bequer's tomb. Why does she wants to leave? She gave me some silly reasons. I believe she thinks we don't like her. I knew this would happen. I asked her to stay until we find a new maid. I don't want to burden Pilar too much. By the way, why did you take me out when Roberto arrived? They need to talk alone. Do you think he'll convince her'? I don't know but I assure you, he's trying. This isn't right... - I can do it right if you let me. - Don't make fun of it. You know what I'm talking about. What's wrong with that? You're my wife, aren't you? - Ex wife. - Nonsense. What's more, you agreed to come back to the house today. No, don't rush me. I only promised to think about it. But I haven't decided anything yet. You can't do this to me. I had everything arranged, I even put flowers in all the house. The boys are arranging a party tomorrow at Daniel's place. I'm really sorry, Roberto. But... I want to be sure. Alright, as you wish. At least you can come with me to the party. They'll be pleased to see you. - Well... maybe if you promise to behave yourself. Of course. - We'll remember our old times. - Certainly not. I said behave yourself. Do you remember? You were a pain. But you loved me. And you still do. Would you like something, Miss? Nothing, Sofia. Thanks, you can go. Wouldn't you prefer I wait for Miss Ofelia? Maybe she would like dinner when she returns. No, she went to the theatre with Marta. I'm sure they'll have dinner some place else. Would you like me to keep you company? - Can I ask why? - It's very late, you're alone... and you could be afraid. No, Sofia. I don't believe in ghosts, if that's what you mean. Excuse me, people are usually fearful of these old houses. Who is it? Who's there? Sofia, is that you? Miss, what are you doing here? No, I didn't see anything but... It was her. I'm sure. - That's not possible, Pilar. Did you see anything Sofia? No, Miss. But I didn't enter in the cellar. Why don't you want to admit strange things are happening in this house? Of course I admit that, but please be reasonable. It was her. - Right, Sofia? You know it was her! - It's not me who you need to convince. Why don't you listen to me and go to sleep? You really need it. - Go with her, Sofia. Do you know what her problem is? - Aurora's death made her very nervous. - Yes, perhaps. The good thing is Roberto will come tomorrow. He'll take her out on a date and everything will be forgotten. What's wrong? Nothing. Why? Do you realise I'm here with you? I'm sorry. I was distracted. Thinking about your ghost? - If you're going to make fun of me... It's just... you haven't thought about anything else all night long. Damn! I never thought I'll be jealous of a ghost. You take things lightly because you don't have to return to the house. What a boring couple! Why don't you dance? Shall we? - No, Roberto. I'm not in the mood. - Come on, don't be like that. Just like old times, come on... Follow her, you idiot. What happened? You're the same as always. You don't care about my problems. There isn't any problem. If you don't want to go back to that house, don't do it. Come with me and that's the end of the story. I don't know... Listen... I know I made mistakes. But, what do you prefer? Spend the night with a ghost or with me? You fool... Let's see Ofelia's face when I tell her. Better... you better see it tomorrow with more light. - I must let her know so she doesn't worry- - You should've telephoned her. What? - I won't be long... - Alright... Bring all your clothes. What happened? - I don't know... - Let's carry her upstairs. Don't get close. She's dead. Did you want something, Sofia? I just wanted to see this bedroom one last time. It's alright. Believe me. It's not easy. This is the house I've lived in for many years. It's full of memories... It's a part of myself. You don't have to leave. Nobody is forcing you. You already know my reasons. You're really convinced that Marta and I, are in danger? Yes. That's what I think. Do you think it's appropriate to leave us at this moment? Miss Ofelia, I'm the first to regret what will happen here. But neither I nor anybody else can help it. Yes, Pedro. It's me. What happened? I see... So? Alright... No, no... Why I would be angry? He won't come? He doesn't even know when. He's in a business meeting. Well... It's not such terrible news, is it? I had impression he'd take us out to dinner. I know what we'll do. We'll arrange a party for the both of us! - Are you mad? - No at all. We have alcohol, some sandwiches, some music, let's show the men they're not indispensable. Sofia is a woman with strong ideas. She took her things and left. Yes, she said goodbye to me. She seemed alarmed. I don't regret it. She was influencing us with her strange ideas. Now the house is very lonely. That's why I wanted you to come with Pedro and me. That's silly. You can't keep me company every night. Well, at least until... I'm not sure... - A change, some days pass... or... - Or aunt Susana kill one of us. - Marta! - Why don't you admit it, Ofelia? It wasn't a heart attack or a fall that killed Aurora and Pilar... It was fear. Fear of what? A ghost? - Both of them saw her. - That's what they believed. They saw her because she's here among us. This house is full of her perfume and her laments... You sound like Sofia. Because, like her, I feel the presence of this woman. I feel her in the dark threatening us... Watching us with her cold eyes... Stop the nonsense, Marta. Aunt Susana is dead, no one ever comes back from there. What happened? Just the lights. Nothing to worry about. I'm going to light some candles. I don't like it this way. Let's light the fire. We're going to have a beautiful fire. - What if there's not enough wood? - The lights will return soon. Of course! I should have thought about that. I'm going to check the fuses. You'll get soaking wet. I won't take long. The rain almost stopped. - What's wrong? - It's her. It's her! - Who? - The old woman is there. How did this get here? It wasn't here before. - Do you believe me now? - Did you see her? I saw her hand, she had her ring on. Can you see how you're imagining things? The ring is in my bedroom, inside the box. Are you sure? No! Don't go in that room, She's in there... We'll see about that. There's no one here. And, of course, the ring is... not here. - Do you believe me now? But... I can't understand. She's taking revenge for Bequer's death. That's the most unfair thing I've ever heard. Bequer's death was an accident, a mistake. Nobody wanted to hurt him. And now she wants to claim the lives of four women. Now I know what aunt Susana was... an old, twisted and cruel woman. Ofelia, listen to me. Tomorrow, I'll throw that portrait in the fire! I don't want to see it ever again. Ofelia, there's something you need to know... Bequer's death was our own fault. I know that! But you didn't know the cat was locked in. That's what we told you so you wouldn't get mad at us. It was a lie. What are you saying? The day Aurora found her canary dead, she had a fit of rage. We couldn't stop her. She took a poker and searched the entire house for Bequer. Finally, she found him in aunt Susana's bedroom. She attacked and beat him many times. Bequer meowed in a horrible way. Suddenly, he jumped at her. Aurora screamed, terrified. Pilar and I tried to help her. Fear seized us. I took the poker from the floor. Pilar took the candelabra... Bequer didn't starve to death. We beat him to death. How could you do this? I've regretted it a hundred times. I swear. Everything happened so fast. - No! That was a crime! - I know. You have nothing to do with it. She's taking revenge on the rest of us. I'm the only one left. You're in danger... We must leave this place. What for? There's nothing we can do now. I'm marked. Maybe if we get out of this house! Aurora died in the library. Far from this house. Pedro's here. Let's go, Marta. It's all useless, useless... I'll go get Pedro. He'll protect us. Pedro, I can't open. - What's wrong? - I can't explain now. Climb the fence. - But, what's going on? - Marta is in danger! Climb over. Marta, where are you? Take me out of here, Pedro.
