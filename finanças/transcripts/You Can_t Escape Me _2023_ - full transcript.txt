How long you been doing it? - Oh, high school. - Wow. But if you count painting food on the walls, then been a lot longer. - Hmm. - Those two are acrylic. - Size? - 20x24. - You got talent. Ms. Carver. - Oh, Erin, please. Wait, you think so? I mean... Thank you. You're very welcome. You've got a great eye. I'd like to see these two. Yes, absolutely. I will bring them on in. We're having a show of emerging local artists, and I think they'd be perfect. Thank you, thank you. Thank you so much. - No, thank you. - Thank you again. - Take care. - Again, you too, bye. Jared! Darling. - They love my painting. - Oh, wow, congratulations. The gallery owner says I have talent. Well, she's got a brilliant eye. And they said that they're gonna put them in a show. A show. And if they excel, then they're gonna display even more. This can totally change my life. Oh, well, you two look like you're having a good day. Polly, I just found out that a gallery wants to display my painting. Oh, that's wonderful. So cool. Oh, you must be very proud, Jared. Beyond words, yes. Oh, well, I didn't mean to interrupt your day. I just wanted to come over and see if Erin wanted to stop by for some tea sometime. Oh, yes, absolutely. I would love that. Well, great, anytime. Congratulations, Erin. - Thank you. - Bye, Polly. Bye. - A show? - Yes. Wow, in a gallery. So how many paintings is he planning to put up? Two for now, but he says if they sell, he'll be asking for more. That's amazing. And he has an eye for talent. It's just... It feels so surreal. I can't believe it's actually happening. Well, you worked really hard, and your parents would be really proud of you. I wish they could be here to see the show. They'll still be with you, Erin. So what does Jared think about all this? Oh, he was shocked, yeah. Kept asking me how many people would actually be at the show. I don't think he really believed me at first. Why wouldn't he believe you? Well, he just sees my paintings kind of more as a hobby than an actual serious job. I don't think he was expecting something like this. - Huh. - What? Nothing. Okay, just say it, Suzanne. Nothing about your painting seems like a hobby. He should see how hard you work. He does, but he's a lawyer. Art just doesn't really seem like a serious career path. Erin, I'm a lawyer, and I don't see your art as a hobby. Okay, but his parents are just super old-fashioned. That's all. He wasn't raised the same way that we were. Okay. You don't have to like him. I don't not like him. I just want him to be supportive of you. He is. He's super encouraging. Good, because he is married to the best painter in the whole world, and he needs to get used to people gushing all over you. - Uh-huh. - I'm serious. Okay, whatever you say. Aww, Katie's texting me. Tell her to get her butt back here. I mean, we agreed to her moving away, but under the conditions that she'd visit more often. And she's not upholding her end of the bargain. Okay, well, she's busy. She was just here two months ago. Okay, well, tell her I wanna see her more often. I mean, we have visitation rights, you know? Visitation? You text her that. Okay, I will. No, on your own phone. She's gonna think it's me. Psh. So how was your day with Suzanne? Oh, it was great. Yeah, we went to the park. We went to a boutique. I got a new dress for your firm's party. I didn't know you were still coming to that. Of course I am. I just wasn't sure if you'd have time now with this big art gallery show. I have plenty of time. Hey, how about I get that? - You don't have to do that. - Oh, I don't know. I mean, I think you had a long day. You're a business woman now. - Oh, I am. - You deserve to go and relax. Okay. I'm gonna take a shower. All right. I'll be up in a minute. Oh, thanks. I didn't realize I left it downstairs. Yeah, just had a talk with Angel. Oh, what's wrong? Did he cancel the show? No, no, he's fine. He just wanted to check positioning. He wants you to call him back. Oh, thank God. You answered my phone? So this is what you've been hiding from me, huh? I wasn't hiding anything from you. You've been calling him the gallery owner, being careful not to use pronouns. What are you talking about? Erin, you made me think Angel was a woman. - No, I didn't. - You didn't correct me. I've been sitting here thinking all these private meetings that you had with the gallery owner was a woman. Business meetings at the gallery. Why does it matter if it's a man or a woman? Because it does, Erin. Is this how you got into the gallery, by just flirting? I get in because they liked my paintings. I can't believe that you would accuse me of something like this. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure it was all professional. I just... look, next time, why don't you just be up front about it? And I'll go down there with you. But... You never know who anybody's gonna be. He might seem like a nice guy, but you don't know what his intentions are. You work with women. Do you need me to go down and make sure that everything's okay? Okay, we both know that's not the same thing. Come here. The call's forgiven, all right? I love you. I love you too. Jared? Yeah? Have you seen my phone? Check the side table. Oh, my God. What are you wearing? Oh, this is the dress I bought. Do you like it? Sweetheart, you can't wear that. What do you mean? - That's way too low-cut. - Oh, oh. You could wear that on a date with me, Erin, but in a room full of my coworkers, that's not gonna fly. I'm sorry. I didn't realize. I'll go change. Yeah, okay. Hurry up. We're gonna be late. - Don't worry, you look great. - Great. And I wouldn't care at all. And nowadays, this kid walks into my office, so I said, "Son, to need an estate lawyer, first you need to have an estate." And he walked right outta my office. Oh, Dale, you always know how to put 'em in their place. It's one of my many, many talents. Isn't that right, honey? Yes, dear. Oh, should we welcome the assemblymen? Yes, I think we should. Will you watch my wife for just a sec? - My pleasure. - Be right back, sweetie. Sure. You don't have to pretend to be interested, darling. The boys are just boring us with their shop talk. - Oh, no, it's okay. - No. One more minute of lawyer talk, and I definitely would've needed another drink. - Are they always like this? - The parties? Sadly, yes. It's just an excuse for them to show off their wives and girlfriends. The boys are like peacocks with cell phones. Well, I guess that's something for me to look forward to. Well, actually, I'd say it is. I mean, for someone like Jared, you really hit the jackpot. - He's pretty amazing. - Mm. Well, Dale and I were thrilled when he told us he had found you. I mean, we've seen how quickly he gets bored with women he dates. But with you, he was telling us one day about this beautiful woman he met, and then the next day, we get to save the date. Yeah, I guess we're head over heels. Yeah, I bet you were. What was it, six months after you met, there was a wedding? Something like that. Yeah, I think it's wonderful. A little impulsivity never hurt anyone. Right, I mean, I think young people today, they're just too worried about planning everything, don't you think? I guess so. Besides, you'll get to know each other, and I'm sure you're learning more about him every day. - I am. - That's wonderful. I think the first year of marriage should be all about surprises, don't you? Mm. - Hey great party, Cynthia. - Oh, thank you. I'd say it turned out all right. Have you met Jared's wife? - I don't think so. - This is Erin. Erin, this is Carter. Hi, it's nice to meet you. Carter is the newest member of the firm. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go over here for a second. Sure. Well, Jared's a lucky man. - Oh, thank you. - So what do you do? I am actually a painter. - What? - Mm-hmm.. That's amazing. You do it professionally? That's the goal. I actually have a gallery show coming up. Yeah, just stop. - I'm sorry, where? - Oh, downtown. - Downtown. - Yes. - Okay. - Yes. Will you excuse me for just a sec? Excuse me, guys. Darling, you got away from me. - Hi. - Hey, Carter. It's so great to see you outside of the cubicle. What are you two talking about? Oh, we were just getting acquainted. Erin was just telling us about the art show. You never mentioned what a talented wife you have. Yeah, isn't she? Sweetie, will you come with me for just a sec? - Oh, yeah, sure. - Yeah, come on. Great seeing you both, guys. What were you doing in there? What do you mean? I was just chatting with people. - You embarrassed me, Erin. - How did I embarrass you? Come on. Carter. You were practically throwing yourself at him. No, I wasn't. Honey, he just joined in our conversation. Look, I know what I saw. All right, you were standing like this close to him. It's loud in there. He probably was just having a hard time hearing. Sure, sure. What's your angle telling everybody about this art show anyway? You know that they're gonna think that I can't provide for you, right? I'm trying to make a good impression. Do you think I want to be schmoozing these stuck-up lawyers? All right, fair enough. Yeah, you got that right. - I'm sorry, okay? - No, no. Let's just go back in, okay? No, I'm sorry. I will stay by you the whole time. Right. It's just not what I'm used to. I don't really know how to act. I feel like everyone's just staring at me. They're not, and I should have taken that into account. Come on, let's go in. You've got a councilman to woo. Right. Ah, well, I think that went pretty well overall, don't you? Yeah, once... you know, once you calmed down. Once I calmed down? Look, I can't deal with you getting jealous every time you see me interacting with another guy. - Oh, so you think I'm jealous? - Yes. Like with that Carter guy and with Angel before. It's like, half of this population is male. I can't guarantee I'm never gonna speak to another... Damn it, Erin, you know what? That's not what was going on, okay? Whoa, whoa. I am just trying to have an adult conversation with you, and you are already getting worked up. Okay, how about this? How about you get to throw yourself at any guy you want, and I just won't get upset about it. Does that sound fair to you? Okay, but I'm not throwing myself at these guys. Erin, yes you are. I know what I saw. - You're seeing wrong. - Okay, you know what? This was supposed to be about me. Not you, me. God, you can't stand for one thing... That's not about you. Great, now everybody knows we're fighting. Is this what you wanted, huh? Does this this make you happy? - No. - Huh, is this what you want? - No. - No? You know, you're so desperate for attention that you don't even care how you get it. You're never gonna embarrass me like that again. You understand? Okay, yes. Let's go home, darling. That sounds miserable. I'm so sorry he acted like that. I don't get it. It's just not him. I mean, isn't it? Ever since you met, it's always been about him having things his way, keeping you where he wants you. A little bit, but he's never done it in a mean way before. That's because you never stood up to him. I'm sorry, but it's true. Now you're getting all this attention and this recognition, and he can't stand it. I don't know. Isn't it first year adjustments? Erin, he was screaming at you in your car and hitting the steering wheel. Is that what you want in your marriage? I shouldn't have said anything. How long are you gonna let it go then? Until he puts a hole in the wall, until he hits you? - He's not gonna hit me. - You don't know that. You talk about what kind of person he is and what he's capable of. You can't know those things. You've only been married six months. I still feel like we know each other well enough. Look, I know that we didn't date very long, but I feel like I still know what kind of person he is. I know you do. But if he's showing you his true colors now, then you have to come to terms with that. I mean, all this stuff, this yelling, the jealousy, these things don't get better. They get worse. I know. I just don't wanna assume anything. Okay, you know I'll always be here for you, right? I know. This is quite the event. - I'm nervous. - Nervous? There's nothing to be nervous about here. Just stick by me. I'll look out for you. They look really nice. - Really? - Yeah. Not as nice as you though. Aww. This is it. It's finally happening. Oh, my gosh, I know. I can't believe it. I did a sweep of this place, and your paintings were the best ones hands down. - Do you seriously think so? - Oh, absolutely. Suzanne, it's so great of you to come to the show tonight. Well, you'd know I'd do anything for Erin. Yeah, I guess we have that in common. I bet you anything someone's gonna snatch these up. - I'm gonna get us some drinks. - Okay. Do you really think somebody's gonna buy these? Without a doubt. Can you imagine? Here's the woman of the hour. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, how are you? - This is Suzanne. - Angel, nice to meet you. So what do you think? It's perfect. I mean, everything about it. Just between you and me, I think we might have a buyer or two interested. Shut up. I swear, but it's not a done deal. That's amazing. Hi, I'm gonna borrow my wife. Don't mind, do you? Of course. Come on, sweetie. Lemme talk to you. I'll be back. Stop it. What are you doing? What am I doing? What are you doing, Erin? I'm trying to enjoy my gallery opening. Looked to me like you were enjoying a little bit more than that. I'm just talking to people. Just talking to people. That's all you're ever doing. I turn my back for two minutes, and you're with him. Him. You mean Angel? Yeah, I mean Angel. You know what, Jared, you're being paranoid. Nothing was happening, so I'm going back inside, okay? - No, we're going home. - Let me go. I can't go home. This is my gallery opening. So this is what you want, huh? A bunch of people fawning over you? Am I not enough for you, Erin? Jared, you are acting crazy, okay? Crazy. You wanna see crazy? Now listen to me. I'm your husband, and I am telling you right now that we are getting in that car, and we're going home. You understand? Yeah? Good. Come on, sweetie. People are gonna wonder where I went. Good, let 'em. - I didn't do anything wrong. - Really? Angel was just congratulating me. - Yeah, by kissing you. - It was not a kiss. This was my really big night. People were just excited. So that's it, huh? You just get to go be this brilliant artist, and I can just stand next to you and be your little husband, huh? You knew I was a painter when you married me. This was always the plan. This was not my plan. All right, you agreed to love and support me. I'm your husband, not Angel. Me. Okay, you know what? You are just so jealous, you can't even see straight. Oh, so this is my fault, huh? I forced him to come kiss you right in front of everybody? Okay, Jared, just please calm down. No, no, no. Answer my question. I mean, I put a gun to your head, right? And I forced you to kiss him in front of everybody. Right, Erin? Jared, Jared! Okay, okay, I'm sorry. You're right, okay? Okay, I will never, ever speak to Angel ever again, okay? You better not. Now, if I ever see you with that guy again, I don't know what I'll do. Never again, I promise. Good. You're done painting too. You coming? I'm gonna go take a shower. Wash the day off me. Keys, keys, keys, keys, keys, keys, keys, keys, keys, keys. Come on, where are you? Looking for these? Oh, you have them. Going somewhere, Erin? No, I thought that I left the keys downstairs and... Didn't we already have a conversation about you lying to me? - I'm not lying. - You're not lying. You must think I'm stupid. Jared, I don't think that you're stupid. I just think... I told you what lying does to me, Erin! Jared, please calm down. You're trying to leave me for Angel, aren't you? No, I would never do that to you! You told me you loved me. I'm not gonna let you do this to me. Ah! No! Oh, you made me do that. You made me do that, Erin. You made me do that. Are you home? It's me, Erin! Polly, please. Can I come in? - Erin? - Hi, can I come in? Of course, of course. What happened to you? Do I need to call the police? No, no. Can I just stay while I make a phone call? Yeah, you need to call Jared? No, no. I don't need to call Jared. That is the last thing I need to do. Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. It's fine. Actually, no, no, it is not. It is not fine. It's not. Come here. Here, come with me. Is this the first time something like this has happened? I never thought that it would get this far. It's upsetting, isn't it? You wonder what you did wrong and how you can be better next time. Well, yeah, I guess I've thought that, but... Honey, I've been through it all. I'm sorry. Yeah, we were just like you two. But the most important thing to remember is that he wouldn't get this angry if he didn't really love you. You know? What was it? What was what? What'd you do to get him so angry? I talked to somebody, and he got jealous. Yeah. Well, that'll do it, right? My husband, Arthur, he had a temper. If I so much as looked at another man, he'd just go off. They are emotional creatures, men. They try to pretend they aren't, but something makes 'em angry, and they just can't help it. We're the tough ones, right? Right. Could I use your restroom? Yeah, sure. It's down the hall. Thank you. Erin. Suzanne, I need help. Are you sure there isn't anything else I can offer you? No, my friend will be here soon. Well, I'm glad to know that you knew you could come here. I am always happy to give you all the advice I can. You know, I would be so upset when Arthur and I would get in one of our arguments. But the best thing to do is just forgive and forget. Yeah, I will. Thank you. Oh, I know, right? Right now, it feels like you're just never gonna get over it. But hey, tomorrow is a new day. Thank you again. Okay, now, don't get angry. - What? - This is for your own good. What did you do? I know you're upset, but you're never gonna solve anything by running away from your problems, okay? Is that Jared? Did you call Jared? He was just as upset as you were, and he feels horrible for what he did, okay? I promise you, they really don't mean it. No, Polly, Polly, no. Sweetheart. Oh, I was worried. I don't wanna talk to you right now. I was so scared that something happened to you. Something did happen to me. I know, and I'm sorry. I swear I will never hurt you again. See, honey, he knows what he did was wrong. I do, I do. Please just come home. Just give me another chance, and I swear I will make this up to you. I can be a better man, please. Come on, sweetheart. It'll be okay. Let's go home. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Thought you could run from me, huh? Jared. Tell the neighborhood all our secrets. Oh, oh, Jared, Jared. Please, I'm sorry. - Yeah, you're gonna be sorry. - Oh, Jared, just let me go. You're not going anywhere, all right? Let her go. This is a family matter. Let her go, unless you want the cops to get a nice little video of you holding her against her will. You don't want to do that. That is where you are so wrong. Get in the car. So you'll take the bed, and I'll take the couch. Oh, no, I'm not gonna do that, gee, Suzanne. It's no problem. I love sleeping on the couch. - You always stunk at lying. - I guess that's a good thing. You know, I really wish you'd let me take you to the hospital. No, no, really, it's fine. It's just sore. Or at least to the police, file a report. Jared's a lawyer. He knows all the cops. He's an estate lawyer. He can't know that many cops. His dad's a prosecutor. His uncle's a judge. Nobody's gonna listen to me the second I say I wanna file a complaint against a Carver. What about getting your stuff back? I don't know, Suzanne. I'm just really tired. Sorry, I just... I really want him to pay for what he did to you. You're a good friend. Come on, got some stuff for us to do tonight. Just a couple more pictures. We need these. Hello, my name is Erin Carver. I'm looking to freeze my credit. Can you help me with that? Do you have any bank accounts that aren't under his name? No, he said I wouldn't need one. That's okay. I'll lend you some money until you get back on your feet. No. Oh, you don't have to do that. Yes, I do. No, seriously, Suzanne, I can't accept that from you. It's what families do, and I'm your family. We're gonna get through this, okay? Just gotta take one step at a time. Suzanne, is that you? Suzanne? Hello, darling. How'd you get in here? Hey, what happened? - I thought he was here. - It's okay. It was just a dream. Remember when we were roommates, you, me, Katie, whenever we couldn't sleep? - Cookies. - Midnight cookies. Nothing bad could happen to us if we had our cookies. - I miss those days. - I miss those cookies. - What did I do to get here? - It is not your fault. No, I rushed into it. I married him. I think I just really wanted to have a family again. It's still not your fault. No one can blame you for wanting a family. What am I gonna do? We're gonna figure something out. Now I'm gonna go make some cookies. Suzanne. Suzanne, he's here. He's actually here. - What? - He's outside in his car. I just saw him. I can't stay here. Now we just need to figure out how to get you out of here without him following you. There you are. Suzanne. Sorry, I would invite you in, but I have this strict policy against scumbags on my property. And before you get any bright ideas, I've got this nifty security camera and some nosy neighbors who also hate scumbags. It takes a village, Jared. - I made it. - How long until you leave? A few hours. It's three different buses, but I'll be harder to track this way. Katie knows where to meet me. Be careful. Get a pay-as-you-go phone and turn this one off. And I think you should go by a different name while you're out there. I will. I'm gonna miss you. Not as much as I'll miss you. And be safe, Erin. Hey, Suzanne? Thank you so much for everything. Erin. Was your trip okay? Yeah, yeah, it was fine. - Where's your bag? - This is all I have. Erin, I'm so sorry. Thank you so much for getting me. I know... Of course, always. You know that. Come on. Let's get you back to my place. I've got plenty of space, so stay as long as you need. You can stay in my room. I can sleep in my office. Katie, I'm not gonna sleep in your room. Suzanne let you sleep in hers. I'm gonna let you sleep in mine. That's what best friends do. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You hungry? I'm fine. I'm just really exhausted. You wanna talk about it? It sounds like a lot of drama went down. Maybe later. I kind of just want to relax. I'm sorry. Breakups are the worst. You have no idea. But hey, at least we get to spend more time together. And you'll love Portland. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure I will. It's gonna be okay, Erin. All right? There he is. - Hi, Mom. - Jared. - Happy birthday, Dad. - Oh, thank you. Where's Erin? Ah, she wasn't feeling well, so she decided to stay home, but she sends her best. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope everything's all right. Yeah, just a cold. What? Well, it's none of our business of course, but we heard you two were having problems. Where'd you hear that? Well, Anthony Lister said he saw you two arguing outside the office party. I should have known. Nobody can keep their mouth shut at that office. The first year of marriage can be difficult. Has she been unhappy? It was an argument. We're fine. Well, I'm happy to talk to her for you. Her mother passed on. She needs someone to guide her to help her understand what marriage really means. - I'll keep that in mind, Mom. - Good. I'm happy to help any way I can. Now, if you just excuse me for a moment. You know, the Carver family has a reputation in this town. Yeah. And you're responsible for holding up that reputation. I know. So do you mind telling me why a buddy of mine on the police force called and said that your wife is trying to file a restraining order against you? Look, Dad... You are her husband, are you not? Yeah. And you're gonna let her behave like that? No. What about this? - That's cute. - See? Brand-new wardrobe, fresh new start. You need to get control of her. I will. See your mom and I? See how happy we are? Now, we wouldn't have that unless we knew who was in charge. So who's gonna be in charge, Jared? I am. I'm in charge, Dad. Great perspective, Lindsay. Uh-huh, yeah. See the shading right over here? If you bring it out even more, it's really gonna pop. Thanks. Well that's an interesting take on a still life. Yeah, I'm not much of an artist. Hey, at least you're trying. It is very original. Yeah, that's what I was going for, original. Yeah, it's great. Keep up the good work then. Oh, wow. Have a good one. See you next week. Have a good weekend, Miles. Thanks, Lauren. It's really coming together by the end. I appreciate that. You know, art isn't really my thing, but my buddy bought this class to take with his girlfriend, and they broke up. Yeah, I didn't want him coming alone. - Oh, well that's really sweet. - Anyway, I'm having fun. It's a nice break from work. - What do you do? - I'm a lawyer. I need to finish packing up. Sorry. I'll let you go. Lauren. Oh. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. No, it's okay. I'm just easily startled. I know. I've watched you in class. I know what it's like, always on high alert, never able to really relax. Okay. It doesn't have to be that way. What do you mean? Look, I don't mean to impose, but I own a gym in town. We specialize in teaching self-defense classes to women. Oh, self-defense. I have one class in particular that's for victims of domestic abuse. I thought I would invite you to come if that's something you might be interested in. - How did you know? - I just know. I've worked with a lot of women over the years. I kind of have a sense for these things. I'm not sure if... You don't have to decide right now. You're always welcome, even if you wanna just come and watch and scope it out. - Yeah, I'll think about it. - Please do. Jared, I told you she's not here. Again, I don't know where she is. Okay, have you checked in with Suzanne? Yeah, I'll call everyone I know. Just let me know if you hear anything. Bye. Jared called you? - Again. - Again? I'm sorry. I didn't want you to freak out. Okay, well, I mean, if he's calling you, he probably doesn't think I'm here, right? He would've just showed up. - Yeah, yeah, I think so. - Do you think he believed you? I don't know. Okay. Erin, Erin... That's great, Emma. Love that follow through. Try a cross at the end. Yes. Lauren. - Hi. - Hi. I thought about what you said. I think I'd feel better if I could defend myself. I'm glad you came. Come on in. Would that actually work? Practicing punches like if you are actually attacked? It can. The element of surprise, doing lasting damage, so your attacker won't be able to come after you once you do get away. Yeah, I wanna learn that. In a life-or-death situation, you don't have time to think, just to act. You have to practice into that muscle memory. I don't actually think that it'll be like life or death. Well, no one ever thinks it'll be life or death until it happens. Right. I never thought I'd get here. My husband, I think he might know where I am. How do you know that? Because he reached out to my friend that I'm staying with, looking for me. Okay. She said that she hadn't seen me, but I don't know if he believed her. That must be really scary. So that is why I am here. Well, we can help you get some of that power back. That's why we exist. I can't believe I let this happen. Hey, listen. You didn't let anything happen. Intimate partner violence is way more common than anyone wants to admit, and we don't do enough to combat it. Women and men suffer every day all over the world. Now, we focus on women because they're more likely to end up dead at the hands of a partner. - Thank you for helping me. - That's what we do. So you ready to get started? - I guess. - Then let's do it. All right, here we go. All right. Now, the first thing you need to learn is your stance, yeah? All right. So you want your legs wide. Think like you're on a railroad track, yeah? You want your knees to be bent, up on the balls of your feet, so you can move. Your hands are up to protect your face. Now, this looks nonthreatening, but it really readies you to strike when you need to, okay? So I want you to give me a jab with your left hand and across your body with your right. Jab with your left hand and across your body with your right. Now this is how you protect yourself, okay? This is how you stay ready, okay? Let's go to the mitts. And across your body with your right hand. There you go. Jab with your left hand here. Cross with your right. One more. Jab with your left hand. Cross with your right. All right, now let's move. Jab, cross, come on. Jab, cross, one more. Jab, cross, keep going. You're not gonna make this easy on him, okay? He's not getting away with anything without a fight, all right? Jab, cross. All right, move with me. Jab, cross. Take your hips with me. There you go. Take your hips with you. One more. Jab, cross, give me some power. Jab, cross. You're strong, jab. Yes, I feel it, one more. Okay, one, two. One, two. One, two, one, two. One, two, one two. - Hey, girl. - Hi. How was your day? It was pretty good. I tried out that gym. Oh, yeah? Did you like it? - Yeah. - Good. You seem chipper. Oh, it's nothing. And what is nothing's name? Harvey. It's really, seriously not a big deal. I met him at lunch. He got my turkey and brie. I bought his pastrami and rye. Oh, sounds like a rom-com worthy setup. Yeah, we'll see. Anyway, I'm glad you had a good time at the gym. I'll be in the kitchen if you need me. Lauren, may I? Sure. Listen, I wanted to apologize for the other day. - What for? - I don't know exactly. But it kind of seemed like I freaked you out. Oh, no, it's just... you said you were a lawyer. Oh, I see. So maybe Shakespeare was right when he said, kill all lawyers. No, no, no, it's just, my ex... My hopefully soon-to-be ex-husband, he's a lawyer. And I'm going through stuff with him right now, so... Stuff? Sorry, that's way too personal. No, it's okay. So what kind of lawyer is he? An estate lawyer. Oh, I would've broken up with him too. What kind of lawyer are you? Environmental. Oh, so you got a law degree to protect the earth. - That's right. - That's pretty cool. Yeah, they're making a superhero movie about me. Pretty cool. - Oh, are they? - Mm-hmm. But like super low budget 'cause environmental lawyers make no money. Oh, so you're officially nothing like my ex. Hypothetically, if I came here for a cup of coffee before class next week, is there any chance I'd see you again? I would say that the odds are pretty good, hypothetically. Okay. Yes, that's good. All right, I wanna see your escape technique. AJ. Let's go. Okay, yep. Come on. Focus Yes, good. All right, that was a hard one. - Yeah, let's go again. - It's okay to take a break. - I don't need a break. - Hold on. We should chat for a minute. It's been a while since we checked in. Have you heard from Jared? Actually, no. Not since he called Katie. I think he's staying away for now. Good, have you looked into getting a restraining order? I have. I was trying with a friend, but my ex has so many connections back home, and I'm scared if I try again that he'll find me so. Maybe. But you can't hide forever. It might be worth it to talk to a lawyer around here to at least figure out what your options are. - Yeah, I'll think about that. - All right. Let's get back to work. I got it this time. Okay. Hey! Right here. Let's go. Fancy meeting you here. Miles. Double-tall latte. It's a really good guess. My superpower's perception. - You didn't have to do this. - It's my pleasure. So how was your week? I need a lawyer. I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to come out like that. Are you in trouble? Oh, no, not legal trouble. It's the situation with my husband. And I know that you're an environmental lawyer, so you probably can't help, but I was hoping maybe you know somebody that you trust. - Of course. - Really? Yeah, I know all kinds of lawyers. I just... I don't have a lot of money. I have a buddy from college who does divorce cases. He's a really good guy, and he'd be happy to talk to you and do it as a favor. - Thank you. - Happy to help. All right, everybody. That is time for today, but great job as always. And I'll see you all again next week. Oh, and feel free to work on that shading technique over the weekend too. Hi, can I help you? Sorry to bother you. Do you have any spare drop cloths here? Do you work at the community center? Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm Diane Miller. My husband is Leo, who runs the place. Oh, yes, yes. Leo's wife, of course. Yes, yes. Yeah, we have some drop cloths on that back table over there. Thanks, and you? Oh, Lauren, I teach painting. Lauren, is this one of yours? Oh, yeah, this is nothing though. It's just a demonstration for the students. Oh, wow, well, you have an excellent sense of texture. I'd love to see what you're doing when you're really trying. Oh, thank you. Listen, I have a small gallery in the arts district. If you would like, come by and show me your work. Really? No promises, but we love showcasing local talent. - Okay, I will, yes. - Okay, stop by anytime. Okay. It was nice to meet you. You too. Katie. Are we still on for lunch tomorrow? Okay. Yeah, I'll see you then, bye. Was that the mysterious Harvey? Yes. I think he really likes me. Yeah, I'm sure he does, but don't worry. I won't tell him anything about you. Thank you. Are we repainting? Oh, I got an offer to show some of my stuff to a gallery owner out here. - Erin, that's amazing. - Thank you. Yeah, except for all of my work is back in LA, so I need to create some new stuff, and I am now just realizing that asking you to let me paint here while you're already letting me live here is probably asking you too much. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no. Are you kidding? I think it's a great idea. But you're so busy. How are you gonna make that work? Oh, I'll find some time. I just... I finally feel like I'm starting to get my life started back up again, you know? I'm really happy for you. Lauren, this is Al. Thank you so much for meeting with me. My pleasure. What can I do for you, Lauren? Actually, my name isn't Lauren. It's Erin, Erin Carver. I changed my name so that my husband wouldn't find me. That's understandable. Why don't you start from the beginning? I'm really sorry about what happened to you. Thank you. I feel a lot better with Al helping me, so thank you again for setting that up. Yeah. And sorry for fibbing about my name. No, no worries. Whatever I can do to help you, I will do it. I appreciate that. Do you wanna grab some lunch? I have somewhere that I have to be, but I'll see you in class. Yeah, yeah. Okay. - Okay. - Okay, see you soon. Bye. Come on, yes. Gimme that power, yes. Five, four, three, two, one. Focus, focus. Come on, give me some power. Come on, come on, come on, come on. All right, all right, listen. Your technique is good. I need to feel your fire, okay? Let's go. Come on, come on. What are you gonna do? Come on, come on. He's coming after you. What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? Come on. That's what I'm talking about. Let's go again. You looking for these? You wanna see crazy? Hey. Hi, late workout? Oh, yeah, I couldn't sleep. - Uh, this is Harvey. - Lauren, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Lauren's my roommate. Oh, I didn't know you had a roommate. It's a pleasure to meet you, Lauren. You too. Have a good night. I'll see you inside. Thanks for bringing this by. Yeah, yeah, of course. I'll see you tomorrow for lunch? - I wouldn't miss it. - Bye. Bye. It's beautiful. Your emotional execution is exquisite. I just love your work and I know that all our patrons are gonna love it as well. - Do you really think so? - Oh, yes. Would you be willing to display some of these? We have our little hidden gem show coming up in a week, and I can make space for you. - Next week? - Mm-hmm. If we could get these on the walls right away, if you could get me some originals, that would be great. Yes, yeah, I could do that. And once these are up, the whole city's gonna be talking about Lauren Farmer Harvey, hi. What's going on? You sounded pretty freaked out in your phone call. I need to talk about your roommate. Lauren? What about her? Her name isn't really Lauren, is it? Okay, I don't know what you're talking about. Jared's worried about her, Katie. He just wants to talk. Will you talk to her? That's it. Just talk to her. Honestly, I can't even believe it. When I left LA, I didn't think I'd get another shot at a gallery show. I believe it. You're crazy talented. Thank you Ugh, I've just been working so long at this, it barely feels real. What is it? The show's gonna be under the name Lauren Farmer. It's gotta be tough. I just hate how he controls me, you know? My first show, he completely took away from me, and now this one's not even under my real name. There are gonna be more, so many more. When this is all over, the only thing people are gonna remember is your art, not whose name it's under. I guess. Honestly, I'm kind of bummed this is the last week of class. Yeah, it kind of flew by, didn't it? Mm-hmm. I thought about signing up again, but then I thought maybe there was another way for me to see you without embarrassing myself every single week. I like you. Yeah, but I have so much going on right now. I don't wanna drag you into my... I don't care. I wanna help you. You deserve people who care about you. It looks like, with all the evidence that you managed to compile now with that recent restraining order, you have enough evidence to press charges if that's what you wanna do. - Really? - Yeah. But it's totally up to you. I mean, putting something like this on your ex's record can help make sure he doesn't victimize any more women. - So he'll go to jail. - Probably not. You know, in these cases, usually the best you can hope for is probation, and that's if you win, which is certainly not a guarantee. But hey, it's gonna go into his public record that he is an abuser, and that's something, especially for a lawyer. Okay. Hey, I just have to warn you that any trial can be emotionally difficult. They will do everything they can to make you look bad. Can I have time to think about it? Of course, please. I don't normally do pro bono work, but Mr. Hastings, he made an impassioned plea for you. Well, you must have seen how persuasive he could be in law school. Oh, no, we didn't attend law school together. No, I just met him a few weeks ago when he told me about your case. Oh, um... I must have misunderstood. Hey, you take care of yourself, okay? And I'm gonna be in touch with you soon. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Miles lied to me. He must have been working with Jared this entire time, sending him updates. He knows where I live, Cassie. I think I need to leave town. Are you sure? I don't really think I have another choice. Yes, you do. If you start running now, you're never gonna be able to stop. And if I stay, he's definitely gonna find me. And then what'll happen? He'll drag me back to LA, kill me. Unless you fight back. - I am not ready for that. - Yes, you are. Erin, you've been training hard. You're smarter than him, and you will have him on your home turf. Come on, Erin. You can do this. I don't know. Let's get back to work. You cannot lose focus, not even for a minute. Your attacker is bigger than you, stronger than you, but you can still win. What do you do if you get hit? - Keep going. - That's right, always. No matter what, never, ever give up. There is no playing fair when it comes to fighting for your life. There are no rules. You do whatever you have to do to survive. You got this. - Sorry. - I'm okay. Erin, please, call me back, okay? I can explain. - Hi. - Hi, you're back. Yeah, just for a few minutes though. I have to run to the gallery to meet up with Diane. Oh, okay. You've been out a lot. Yeah, I'm spending extra time at the gym. Okay, why? I think that Jared might know where I am, and I think that Miles might be working with him. - Wait, what? - Yeah, he lied to me. So I definitely think he's hiding something. Miles working with Jared. I don't know, Erin. You know how careful I have to be. What if the thing has just gotten way too big? What do you mean? I mean, I know Jared has made mistakes, but do you think he's really that type of psycho? Okay. Where is this coming from? Nowhere. I just... have you really fully talked to him about it? I mean, maybe you've built him up in your head to be this sort of villain, and that's all you can see. I didn't build him up in my head. Okay. I'm just trying to help you. Hey. - Hi. - Your paintings look amazing. Thank you. I'm sorry for what I said earlier. It's fine. I just want you to be happy. You know that, right? I know You want me to tell him to go away? No, I'll go talk to him. I am so sorry for not being, like, 100% honest with you. - Are you working with Jared? - No, absolutely not. Then why did you lie to me? Because I didn't think you'd accept my help. I didn't know any divorce lawyers, and I just... I wanted to take care of you. Well, I can take care of myself. I know you can, but you shouldn't have to. Are you sure that's all it was? Yes, I really care. Are you enjoying your big day? Yes, it's amazing. Because it's about to get a lot better. Are you ready for this? - For what? - All your paintings sold. Wh... Which ones? All of them. All of them, oh, my God. That's incredible. The minute they went online, they were sold, gone. They all sold to the same collector, didn't they? Yes, he was quite taken with all of them. - What's his name? - Let me check. Someone by the name of Jared Carver. Jared Carver bought all my paintings. Do you know him? - How did he know? - I swear it wasn't me, okay? If you do not want to sell the paintings to him, we can work something out. - I have to go. - Let me come with you. No. Erin, you don't have to freak out. He found me. I don't know if it was Diane or Miles. It's okay. Jared just bought your paintings. He wanted to do something nice. Something nice. I've been doing everything I can to get away from him. He's been really working on himself. He's been in therapy, anger management classes. He wants to get back together with you. How do you know that? He's just really worried about you. He wanted to make sure you were okay. You're still talking to him? Why are you still talking to him, Katie? I'm not, but he sent someone to find you. Someone? Someone who? - Harvey. - Oh, good, your boyfriend. No, he's not my boyfriend. It turns out that he's actually a PI. He wanted to see if you were staying with me. He convinced me to talk to Jared, and he explained everything. He was just worried about you. Please don't be mad at me. I cannot be around you right now. It's okay. I told him that you weren't ready to see him. Erin, he bought your paintings because he thought it was a good first gesture. I don't know what you don't understand. He's going to kill me. He's not gonna kill you. He's sorry. You should have heard him crying on the phone. - Don't answer it. - Erin. - Hello, sweetheart. - Get out. Just hear him out. Thought you could run from me, huh? - I'm calling the police. - No, you're not. You're coming home with me. This little game is over. Wait, Jared, no, that's not what we talked about. You can leave now. No, you said you were gonna apologize. Leave now. Leave her alone. Katie... oh, my God, Katie! Katie, please, please. Hey, come on. Wake up, wake up. I'm warning you. Just walk out that door and leave. You're warning me? Whoo, that's funny, Erin. I don't think you're in a position to make demands right now though. Look, this is gonna go one of two ways. Either you apologize to me, beg for my forgiveness for embarrassing me in front of my friends and family, and then we go home, and you spend the rest of your little life making this stunt up to me, or you're gonna be very, very sorry. What was that, Erin? You wanna fight me, huh? I'm bigger than you. I'm stronger than you. And I will always, always... Be in control of you. Look at you. You look pathetic. What in the hell, Erin? Whoo! You're not calling anyone. You made me do this. You really want to fight me, huh? You think you can beat me? You don't control me anymore. Not in control, huh? Sure about that, Erin? Yes. I'm gonna to kill you. You got lucky. Usually, when we get these calls, things go the other way. Yeah. You can come by the station tomorrow and answer a few more questions. - Okay. - You try to get some rest. You did an impressive thing today, you know? Erin, I'm so sorry. I know. I was just trying to help. He was so... He could be really convincing. I can't believe I trusted him. Hey, no. I'm just really glad that you're gonna be okay. - You okay? - I will be. I'm so sorry that I suspected you. I would've suspected me too. I'm just sorry I wasn't here to help you. It wasn't your fault. I know. Well, then what is it? I just can't believe he's gone. - You ready? - Yes. It's gonna be great. Your own show. Good luck. Not that you need it. Let's do this. Hi. Hi, how are you? Good. I think you're gonna love the layout that we came up with. - It's amazing. - Right? Still can't believe you went and moved on me. - Sorry. - Don't worry. We'll still display your work, as long as you'll let us have it. I will keep painting for you as long as you'll have me. I heard about what happened. I just wanna say how sorry I am. I wish I would've known. That way, I could have done something to help. Oh, it's okay. Turns out, I could help myself. There's someone I'd like you to meet. Yes. Ladies.
