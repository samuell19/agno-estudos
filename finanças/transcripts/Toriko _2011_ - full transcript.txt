I don't know... Risa-san... Please, ask me anything. What's your feeling... regarding your brother's contract marriage for the purpose of getting a donor? Wasn't it with somebody named Risa-san? It wasn't a contract marriage. My brother just tricked Risa-san. Wasn't what your brother did... something horrible? Yes, it was. How can you be so proud? Because my brother... did it for my sake. You're close, aren't you? Yes. Do you have siblings? I do. A younger sister. Oh~h... When she was little she was a crybaby. She couldn't do anything unless I was there for her... You find it amusing? No... I was just thinking that my brother must've felt the same way. Being an older brother must be difficult.. Yes, it is. That's why... this time in my brother's difficult moment, I will help him. What's the matter? Oh, nothing... I was just recalling that my younger sister said the same thing. Sounds nice. Well... Is that all?? Come back anytime. I won't come again. You!!

I really am! then what's this? The Gemini Meteoric Swarm. I didn't get to see it last year. I made a date with Mizuki to go see it tomorrow. Really?

Please take care. Yes. Thank you very much. Do you think it's snowing already... in Hokkaido? Huh? My worthless brother has disappeared. He even took all my savings. Shall I go to Hokkaido, huh? There are times... when I think everything was a dream. Dream? That I met that guy, and stayed in that home, too Even having the surgery... the whole thing. It wasn't a dream. Huh... Don't you understand? That it wasn't a dream. That home and that guy, too. I'm home. Welcome back. Kengo... this was in the mailbox. Huh? Huh? account book Makihara Risa I guess Risa probably wanted to pay us back. She deposited a little almost every day. Hello? I'm fine. It's been a while Yeah. I've been abroad for a while. I've been longing to hear your voice. Really. Can we meet now? Oh! I just said you already resigned. Huh? A guy came asking for you. Is it ok to not go after him? Probably just my foolish brother. I see. Have you found a new job? I'm sorry. I had wanted to keep at this shop forever, too. What is it? Did you come to watch the fish? Watching them has a calming effect, right? Honestly, jellyfish are better. Siblings are alike...you both like jellyfish, huh? Your brother was the same. He asked why we didn't put in some jellyfish. Excuse me... Did that guy have shaggy hair? No, not at all. Was he tall and hopelessly good looking? Yes, I know what you mean, he certainly was hopelessly good looking. Makihara Risa no group assigned Excuse me. Tonight until early tomorrow morning you can see the most falling stars this year, since it's the peak of the Gemini Meteoric Swarm. What are good observation spots? If you don't have expert knowledge and tools, you can observe it if you go to a public park in your neighborhood, spread a sheet and lie down on the lawn in a high place. When choosing a place, the horizon should be close... Why did you come? Huh? To the shop. You came, didn't you? Oh, yeah... I thought... that I would return this to you. What? You left it in the mailbow, didn't you? My worthless brother.. doing uncalled for things. is that right. I don't want it. (you have it) No... I said it's okay. No, its ok. I said it's OK!! No..... It's okay! Because it's alright. Which way? What? The shooting stars. Oh... Perhaps from that way... There's so much out there you can't see it. Maybe so... Are the jellyfish at your house all healthy? Oh... There's none left. What? I moved them all to the aquarium. So that's what happened. Bet they're crying with loneliness.. Jellyfish doesn't have a brain, so it doesn't know what sadness or loneliness is. I heard that before... Wonder if you can see it from outside? Risa. Yeah? Let's go home together. I heard that before, too. Let's go home... Let's go home. Yes. Viki Subs By The Shooting Star Team
