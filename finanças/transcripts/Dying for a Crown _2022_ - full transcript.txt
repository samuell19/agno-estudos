A few more miles to go. Everything's gonna be totally different this time. Just you and me. Against the world. You know I'd do anything for you, right? Okay, you don't have to get all cringe on me. It's not how it looked online. Well, with a fresh coat of paint and some landscaping, it should be better. It's the only one in our price range. It's not a big deal, Mom. It's a lot bigger than our other house. And maybe the inside is better. I bet we could fix it up and make it look nice. Sorry the electricity hasn't been turned on yet. I'll have it all figured out by tomorrow. Don't worry. It's fine, Mom. No, it's not fine. You have a big day ahead of you. We both do. You deserve a good meal and a good night's sleep, and this is just screwing it all up. It's not screwing it up. It's actually kind of fun. Yeah, sort of like camping. Yeah, except without all the dirt and mosquitoes and creepy men. What did I tell you about watching too many horror movies? I haven't been, I've been reading the news or my Twitter TL. But still. You shouldn't worry about all that stuff. You're young. You should enjoy life while you still can. Mom, you're not that old. Well, you know what I mean. Oh. Guess this place is haunted too. Great! Ugh. You know, we wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for your no-good father. Mom, it's okay. But why am I surprised? He couldn't keep a job for God's sake. - Mom, stop. - He never protected us. And now we're here, and... And it's all gonna work out. Everything is gonna be fine. I don't want things to be hard for you. You deserve a wonderful life, and I have big plans to make that happen, starting tomorrow. You look beautiful. Did a great job with your makeup. I used that tutorial you sent me. Listen, this is your chance for a fresh start, a new chapter, a new beginning. - Mom. - Eh! No one knows you here. You can be anybody you want to be. You can leave the past behind and start over. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. So go make an amazing first impression. And worst case... Hey, look at me. What do I always say? And worst case... Fake it till you make it. Yes! That's exactly how some of the most successful people got their start, by doing just that. If you believe it, you can achieve it. Hey, sweetie, you're gonna do great. Have a great day. You too. Troy High School has a rich tradition and commitment to excellence. Our curriculum offers an abundance of advanced placement courses. - Hi, Mrs. Evans! - Hi, Scarlett! Each year, our ACT and EOC scores remain competitive leading the district and exceeding state averages. Yes, our extracurricular programs offer the same dedication and commitment. From our state champion mock trial team, five-time baseball state champions, football state champions, to our nationally recognized show choir of the south, our school really offers something for everyone. Office. This is you! Any questions so far? Well, if you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. You know where to find me. Everything's been set up for you, your log-in, your e-mail. Our tech guys can show you how it all works. Oh, that won't be necessary. I'm fairly savvy with these things. Well, I shouldn't be surprised. Your résumé is quite impressive. We're in really good hands with you as our second in command. I'm so happy to be here. Ooh, um, one more thing. We're missing your letter of recommendation. Really? I could've sworn I included it. I couldn't find it in your file. Well, I'm sure it's there. It could be that we misplaced it. Even so, we're going to need another copy. That shouldn't be too much trouble, right? Of course. No problem at all. I'll get one to you ASAP. Wonderful. Have a great first day. I will! All right, guys, settle down. Settle down, please. Okay, so we have joining us our latest transfer student, Elle Campbell. Guys, put those phones up. Oh, sorry, Mr. Lee. It was a historical meme. Had to do with today's lesson, I swear. Yeah. So, Elle just moved here and will be completing her senior year with us. I expect for you all to give her a warm Troy welcome, and if she has any questions, just help her out, okay? Elle, there's a seat right next to Ben with your name on it. Why don't you take that seat? All right, guys, take your homework out. We're gonna go and add some notes to it from last week, Wednesday, okay? Ben Greene. You can call me Benji. Ellie Campbell. You can call me Elle or Ellie, whatever you want. Well, how about Campbell? Sure. No way. No. Excuse me. Young man. Detention. - What? - Tomorrow morning. Talking on the phone in the hallway during first period? That's automatic detention. - My mom's in the... - Go to your class. Now! And I'll take that. You can pick it up at the end of the day. Cool. Campbell! Hey! Come sit with us. Thanks. This is Stephanie, Baker, Dean. Everyone, this is Campbell. Yeah, it's Ellie, but Campbell is fine too. I transferred here sophomore year, and these guys were there for me since Day One. It'll be so nice to have a girl in the group for once. I love these dorks, but I can only handle so much. Come on, Steph, we're awesome. It can be hard coming to a new school this late in the game, but we got you. So, what brings you to Pensacola? Mr. Lee said you were from out of state. Well, my dad... My dad's a pretty successful businessman. I honestly don't even know what he does, but he's always jet-setting around the world, leading conferences, writing books. So it's just me and my mom most of the time. He's still a really great dad, but... my mom and I decided that we wanted to be near the ocean for my senior year. We should do a girls beach day. - Yeah. - Why Pensacola? I mean, there are probably plenty of better beaches, right? Well, my mom doesn't need to work, but she got a job here as vice principal, and we heard Troy has a really good tennis team, - which is kind of my thing. - You play tennis? Yeah, Steph is the number one player on the team. She's been MVP since she transferred. We'll get to play together. We're gonna have so much fun. I should get going. But you just got here. It was nice meeting all of you. Hey, follow me on VSCO. ECampbell4. See you around, okay? Totally, sounds good. - That was weird. - You're weird. She's cool. Come on, Benji, admit it. She's new, cut her some slack. I'm just glad I'll finally have a female friend for once. Try not to scare her off. So, what brings you to this part of town? You know, my daughter and I just wanted a fresh start, just bright, sunny skies and ocean breeze. Was your last principal that bad? No, my husband passed away unexpectedly. Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. It's all right. It'll be good for us to be somewhere new. Mm. Ellie was such a popular girl at her last school, so it's gonna take some getting used to. Yeah, of course, that's understandable. I mean, I'm sure she'll find people here at Troy. So, Steve, what got you into teaching? Well, I fell in love with teaching history because, um, I believe it helps us to learn from our mistakes, you know? I thought history was always repeating itself. Guess we don't learn too well. I see you're making yourself right at home here, Lydia. Oh, yes, everyone's been lovely. Good. Can I speak to you for a moment? Sure, what's up? Well, I was going to talk to you in private, but we're a family here, so I suppose it doesn't matter. You gave Miles detention. - Yes. - Hm. Well, our policy is to talk to the students first. Miles was on the phone with his mom. It was a medical emergency. He was laughing really loudly. It disturbed me. It could've disturbed the other students. And he wasn't in class. Isn't that against the rules? It is, but here at Troy, we prefer to have a conversation with our students first, you know? Show compassion, see what's going on with them, and provide support. I understand, but students need a firm hand, otherwise they'll take advantage. Look, I know you're new, and maybe things were different where you were before at your previous school, but we pride ourselves in doing things a little differently here. I'm sure you'll figure it out. Of course. It won't happen again. Good. We're really excited to have you. Enjoy your lunch. Yes! All right! That's game! Go get some water. She's good. Nice swing. Hey, Ellie, wait up! Nice work. You gave our MVP a run for her money. You'll be our number two. Number two? Yeah. Great job, you should be proud. Hi, sweetie. How was the bus? It was fine. So, I'm practically dying to know. How was your first day? Okay, I guess. Okay, you guess? No, no, no, no, no. You have to tell me everything. Did you make a good first impression like we talked about? I tried, but the only person who paid any attention to me was this guy, Ben. He's nice, but he's not cool. Oh, well, just have to get in with the popular group, maybe get to know Kate Wheeler. I get the sense she's the queen bee. Yeah, she is. But I don't know how. You're beautiful, and funny, and fun, and smart, and outgoing, and athletic. Need I go on? You should have no problem getting in with the cool kids. How do you think I became Homecoming Queen? You weren't new your senior year. So it'll take a little more work, but once you find common ground, it'll easen. Mom, are you okay? Yeah. Yes, um... I mean, I... I... I didn't have the best day today. What happened? Let's just say I understand what you're going through. I don't want to bore you with all the details. Let's just say I have to become popular, too. And, um, just like there are cliques with the students, yeah, it's the same with the faculty. Anyway... Let's strategize about you. That's what's most important. I don't know, Mom. Maybe we should just drop it. Absolutely not. We do not get defeated. I was homecoming queen, and instead of marrying my high school sweetheart, I married your fast-talking, full-of-promises father and lived a life of struggle. Not this again. Ellie, listen. This is the life I could've had. My high school sweetheart is one of the top real estate moguls in the country. He travels to exotic places with his gorgeous wife. She just sips cocktails and gets plastic surgery all day. It's magical. Just look at them, they look so happy, so in love. You have to learn from my mistakes and accept that high school is where it all starts. Okay. What do I need to do? Well, let's start with that Ben person. What's his full name? Ben Greene. Why? Benjamin Greene. Mom, what are you doing? Okay, here he is. Just using my perks of being VP. You can do that? Oh, yeah. I mean, technically, I probably shouldn't have the system on my personal computer, but it's harmless. I'm just looking at my daughter's new friends. I guess. It says here he's got straight As, he's on track to apply early decision to all Ivies. - Not bad. - You can see all that? Oh, yeah, and so much more. Becoming popular doesn't happen overnight. It takes time. Use Ben's crush to your advantage. How do you know he has a crush on me? Have you seen your beautiful face and that smile? You could absolutely be the next Troy High Homecoming Queen. I have to work at warp speed. There's, like, 500 kids in my grade. It would be a miracle of epic proportions. Don't talk like that. If you believe it, you can achieve it, right? I can believe it all I want, but shouldn't I try to actually do something about it? Secure the number one spot on the tennis team and work your magic with the popular kids. Find common ground. You've got this, sweetie. Now, eat up, you need your fuel. Okay. So we have the CIA not talking to the president and a president not really knowing what the CIA is doing. So, we actually had American troops disguised in Cuban planes flying over Cuba. Okay, who else wants to go? Kate, how about you start us off? Sure. So, essentially, the Bay of Pigs invasion was a failed operation on the coast of Cuba. It was carried out and conducted by the Cuban exiles but secretly financed and directed by the U.S. government. The invasion failed, however, solidifying Castro as a national hero and widened the divide between the two previously allied countries. Very nicely said. Get some. Of course, history teaches us all a lesson, right? So, what can we say the lesson is that we learned from this today? I think we can learn that people who feel isolated and alone, or people who feel angry, like the Cuban exiles, might be more easily swayed by an authority figure, you know, someone in power, like the U.S., and they might be more inclined to do something bad, like the invasion, but that'll never work because the people that they're angry at are only gonna gain more power that way. Nicely done. Let's open it up for questions and debate. Are you saying that people should never fight for what they believe in? People should just be okay with the status quo? No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that people shouldn't have to be sneaky to get what they want. What if being sneaky is the only way to get something done? Then I'd say not to do it. Some of the world's most influential people had to do some bad things to get what they want. Yeah, well, I'd say it's better to be a good and honest person than to get ahead. That sounds fair. - Call it? - Yeah. Ben, worthy adversary. Everybody give Kate a round of applause. Thank you. Woo! Elle, would you like to go next? Elle, you want to be next? I didn't know that, um... You did do the assignment, right? I, um... Elle, we talked about the homework at the end of last class. I guess I forgot. Okay. See me after class. Ben, you want to take this one? Yeah. Once again, good job, Kate. All right, guys, keep in mind that there may or may not be a pop quiz coming up, so study your notes, all right? Hey. Hey, uh, Elle, can I talk to you for a moment? I really have to go. I have tennis practice, and Coach Cody hates it when we're late. Well, I think that she'll understand when it comes to schoolwork. She won't. At Troy, academics is priority. And if you perform poorly in class, you can find yourself kicked off the tennis team. I just forgot the assignment, Mr. Lee. I'm still getting used to things around here. Promise I'll turn it in tomorrow, okay? Oh! Steve, it's you. Come in. I'm just finishing up some work. Are you sure? I mean, 'cause I can come back if... No, no, no, it's just some light paperwork. Nothing more important than the faculty. What can I do for you? You have my full attention. Um, may I? By all means. Yeah, um... I'm coming to you as a parent, not as a vice principal. Okay. Yeah, it's about Elle. It doesn't seem that she's paying attention in class. Um... Today, she didn't turn in another assignment. She said she forgot. Well, she's new. Yeah, but this is the third assignment that she didn't turn in. I tried to talk to her after class. You out of all people know that the first semester as a senior is the most important semester. Of course. I'll talk to her about it. No biggie. Anything else? Well, I was wondering if, um, you know, if I could offer to help, maybe stay after school? Oh, no, that won't be necessary. Thank you so much for the offer, though. Are you sure? I understand. I'll take care of it. Ellie's got her head screwed on straight. She's got her priorities in line. She'll be just fine. Okay, um... That's it. Great! Thanks for stopping by. Come on, ladies, let's go! Pick it up! Speed, speed! Come on, pick it up! You're dragging. Move, move! Let's go! There you go. That's it. All right! Campbell! Pay attention! Got it, got it. You want to be number one, right? Sorry. All right, everybody, just bring it in. Just bring it in, let's get some water. Let's get ready to play. You want the top spot? Yes, Coach. Dang. Good job. Hustle. Where are you going? Uh, I got to fill up. Tell Coach not to wait for me. Coach, she is getting water. Jesus. You want to do another one? Hey, I'll see you later. - All right, thanks. - Bye. I think maybe the yellow. Cool posters. Thanks, I think we went a little heavy on the glitter. I said, "You got to sparkle if you want to be Homecoming Queen." I'm Ellie. I don't think we've officially met. Oh, yeah, you're in our U.S. history class. I'm Kate. Becca. So how are you liking Troy so far? It's cool, but I have sort of a weird question to ask. I love weird questions. What's up? Do you guys know where I could buy some weed? - You smoke? - Mm-hm, yeah. I've been trying to get Becca to quit. I think it's kind of lame, but that's just me. Oh, yeah, me too. What? I mean, um, I've been trying to quit. I'm just having a party, so I wanted to get some, you know, for other people. Isn't your mom, like, the new vice principal? Yeah, but she's really cool. She lets me do whatever I want. You guys should come over. I don't know. I wouldn't want your mom to see us like that. It just seems weird. No offense. Besides, Parker throws parties all the time 'cause his parents are out of town, so it's easier that way. Oh, it looks like you've got to get back to tennis. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we've got to run too, we have cheer, but it was really nice to officially meet you. You too. I'll catch up with you. - So, what do you like? - Hm? What kind of bud do you like? You still wanna buy some, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. Whatever you have. Indica, sativa... Yeah. Which one? The first one. Well, you're in luck 'cause I actually have kind of a hybrid. I don't usually sell, but I have some extra, so here. It's on the house, don't worry about it. Bye! Does she seem a little odd to you? What do you mean? After that first day, she only eats by herself. And this morning, I walked by her office for a chat and she hid a bunch of papers like she was doing something wrong. I'm just a little concerned. I've had several transfer students and they're all super eager, well, once we started, but, it's just like they want to prove that they're good students, you know? Maybe she's just a quiet girl. Yeah, but even introverts turn in their assignments. But that's not even the strangest part. What was? Lydia's response. It's like she wasn't even bothered, not even in the slightest. Look, whenever a student turns in an assignment late, their grade drops an entire point. And if Elle's grade continues to decline, she could find herself kicked off the tennis team. Lydia has to know that. She's read our school manual that was part of the onboarding process. Look, I'm not trying to sound any alarm bells, just that something seems a bit... Yeah. Let's give her and her daughter a chance. All right? Okay. Just thought I'd let you know. That's what I'm here for. Right. Good talk. Good to see you. Is this seat taken? All yours. She's a strong player. She's perfect. I heard that her grades might be slipping a bit. Is she having some trouble adjusting? Does she look like she's having any trouble? Well, some students... I appreciate your concern, Alice, but let's keep our relationship professional. I don't need any help raising my daughter. I'm sorry. I don't want us to get off on the wrong foot. We're a family here and we take care of one another. Everything's fine. We're good. I have to get back to the game. Ellie will be disappointed if I missed any of her good plays. Of course. Ohh, a letter from your last school just came. - Mm. - Principal had the nicest things to say about you. I'm glad we have you on our team. Yeah! Woo! What was that? I had it! Relax, we just won the game. We're on the same team. Promise it won't happen again. Have you voted for homecoming yet? It's easy, you can do it on like any time. I voted for myself. I mean, why not? Kate's gonna win anyway. She's a shoo-in. Hey. Great game tonight! You want something to eat? No. What's wrong? Stephanie's still number one. Not for long! You really showed your skills on the court. But she's naturally better. Nothing comes naturally. Everything requires work. Maybe you just need to practice more. I can't. I have to study. If I don't get my grades up, I could be dropped from the team. I don't want you to worry about your grades right now. Ugh! It's too much pressure. Just focus on tennis, your friends, and homecoming. That's what matters. I'll worry about the rest. Even if I practice harder, I don't have a shot at beating Stephanie. You'll think of something. Mom, stop! Stop saying everything's going to work out. Maybe it won't. What are you talking about? If you believe it... I don't even have a shot at winning homecoming queen. I barely know anyone, I barely have any friends. Don't talk like that. Mom, I'm serious. Give me one legitimate thing standing in your way. Kate. I don't have a shot against her. Everyone loves her. Well, I think you better figure it out. Hi, sweetie, what are you still doing up? Beauty sleep is very important. I forgot my history book in my locker. I told you not to worry about schoolwork. Leave it to me. But I have an assignment due tomorrow. I'll take care of it. No, Mom, you're not getting it. What am I not getting, sweetie? I also forgot my locker combination. Ellie. But you have the master key to all of the lockers, right? Yeah. I mean, it's not a problem, but why didn't... Well... we better go. You have an assignment to do. Kate Wheeler. I received an anonymous tip that you have contraband on campus. What? I have to do a random drug search of your locker. But I... There must be some mistake. Kate doesn't do stuff like that. Yeah. You want me to search your locker too? Then stay out of it. Kate, you can either open your locker for me or I can use this key to open it. I mean, okay, but you're not gonna find anything, Mrs. Campbell. What's going on? Your mom's searching Kate's locker for drugs. Really? Why? She said she got an anonymous tip or something. Take all the items out one by one. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Do it, Kate, you have nothing to hide. Okay. Kate. What is that? I don't know. I mean, that's... That's not mine. Pick it up, give it to me. We need to have a talk in my office. Show's over! Come on, let's go. That's so not like Kate. She wouldn't have weed in her locker. How do you know? She doesn't do drugs. She wouldn't mess up her future like that. You never really know who someone is behind closed doors. That's so true. Maybe it was Becca's. They're best friends and she smokes a lot. That makes a lot of sense. Back at my old school, I used to always share lockers with my friends. Or maybe she's jealous of Kate and put it there on purpose. Dean, that is not what friends do. Come on, guys, let's go to class. I'll see y'all. See ya. And unfortunately, I'm gonna have to suspend you for three weeks. Those are the rules for keeping drugs on campus. But somebody put that there, okay? It's not mine! Why would someone do that? I don't know! Obviously whoever did doesn't like me. But everyone likes you, hm? Well, then it must be some kind of mistake. I'm sorry. It's school policy. But I just... Contraband was in your locker. But I have no idea how it got there, okay? You have to believe me. Ask Principal Evans, she knows me, knows I wouldn't do this! I'm in charge, not her. Collect your items, I'm gonna call your parents to come pick you up. Wait. How did you know it was in my locker? I mean, you said you got an anonymous tip. Whoever told you... must have planted it on me, right? I'm sorry, Kate, I can't tell you my sources. I know you're disappointed to miss homecoming. That's just the way it is. Homecoming? I'm not concerned about the stupid dance. Okay? I'm trying to get into a good college and this is gonna look horrible on my record and my grades are gonna start slipping because I'm gonna be missing classes. Well, you shoulda thought of that before bringing drugs to school. Why don't you take this for the road? Hey, Becca, do you mind if I sit there? I don't like being near the front. Sure, sit wherever you want. Thanks. The view is better back here. Good day to you all, beautiful people. So for today's lesson, let's partner up. Partner? Uh, yeah. Sure. Lydia? Lydia! Oh, sorry, Alice, I didn't hear you. What's up? You suspended Kate Wheeler? Well, I should have expelled her but three weeks seemed suitable punishment. What happened? You know, I make it a habit of talking to as many students as possible and one student had reason to believe that Kate was hiding something in her locker. So I checked it out and my source was right. Don't worry, I did everything by the book. I got Kate's permission, I didn't touch anything myself, et cetera, et cetera. You've done this before? Of course. I'd conduct random contraband searches at my former school periodically. It helped keep the students in line. It just doesn't sound like Kate. Yeah, you just never know with teenagers. We're gonna have to open an investigation to figure out what happened. Thanks, Lydia. Everything okay, Mom? Of course, why? Oh, what? That? Yeah, it looked really heated. Don't look so worried, sweetie. Everything's totally fine. How was your day? It was actually great. Oh, I'm so happy to hear that. Okay, tell me, I want to know everything. Well, I sat next to Parker in U.S. History. He's really popular and really cute. Oh yeah? Parker, he's a basketball player, right? That's him. And we're partners on a project so we're gonna have to get together after school to work on it. That's so exciting. We can look him up on Focus and get more information on him. Yeah. That'll be great. Okay! Oh, shoot, you know what? I forgot, I have to go back in, there's something I have to finish by tomorrow. Um, can you get a ride home with Parker or on the bus? Yeah, that's totally fine. - Yeah? Okay. - I'll text him right now. Bye. I understand, Mrs. Wheeler. Kate is beside herself. She doesn't smoke pot. Some of her friends do, but she doesn't. She never has. You know her, Alice. She's a good kid, an exemplary student. Why would she have some in her locker anyway? I mean, it doesn't make sense. I know teenagers lie, but come on. Not Kate. I assure you, we're going to take this very seriously. Understand Kate needs to be suspended until we figure it out but we'll conduct a thorough investigation of the incident. Okay. Thank you, Alice. Kate is convinced that someone is trying to sabotage her. It's just awful. We'll get to the bottom of it. Goodnight. Hello? Is someone there? Hello? Is someone there? Hello? Hello? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. It's just you. Yup, it's just me. I'm cleaning the floor, so watch your step. Yeah, I will. I didn't realize the time. It's getting late, I've gotta get home. Okay, have a good night. Yeah, you too. No, no, if I was an invader, I would have been a lot more careful. These guys were amateurs. Oh yeah? Well, what would you have done? I would have ran towards the planes with my arms up, screaming, "Hey! Wait, please!" Yeah, that would have totally worked. Hey, I think it would stun 'em enough to get ahead. They'd be like, "What is this dude doing?" Very strategic. How 'bout you? I would have staged my own invasion one day later. They wouldn't have known what was coming. Wow. Okay, that's actually smart. Dang. Um, like what you did with the place. Oh, our actual house is being built from the ground up so this is just a rental. Oh. Wait, where's your mom? Still working, I guess. Yeah, my parents are never home. I hear you throw a lot of parties. Ha, yeah, the one perk of having parents that travel for work all the time. My dad travels for work too. Yeah. Yeah, it's cool and all but it would be nice if they were around sometimes. I mean, they don't even come to my games. That sucks. Yeah, at least you have your mom. Sometimes I think she might be a little too involved but... I trust her. I love this song. ♪ It's time to let go ♪ ♪ Give up control ♪ Oh, it's cute! Mind if I post? Uh... I guess not. ♪ And you're fine ♪ Uh, we should probably get back to our project though. Yeah. ♪ These roles we're playing ♪ I really like talking to you. Yeah. I can't. I'm sorry, I think you're great but I've been hanging out with Kate and I don't want to be a bad guy. Are you guys hooking up? No, but... Then it doesn't matter. I don't want to hurt her feelings. I think you should forget about Kate. Hi, sweetie. - You must be Parker. - Hi, Mrs. Campbell. Oh, in my house you can call me Lydia. Cool. You guys good? Can I get you anything? Nope. We're good. Thanks, Mom. Well, if you need anything, I'll be in my room. Oh, and Parker, if you guys need to study late, you can sleep over. I wouldn't want you driving in the middle of the night. The roads are really slick out there. Someone could get hurt. All right, thanks. So... Parker. Mom, I don't kiss and tell. I thought we didn't keep secrets. Fine. Fine. It was great. I really like him. Ohh! Look at you, paving your way. Ohh, with a hot new popular boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. Geez, Mom. You know what I mean. Now focus on your other friendships, becoming number one in tennis, and you are on your way to becoming homecoming queen. I know. Stephanie's going down. That's what I like to hear. You go on ahead, I'm just gonna fix my makeup. Okay. Hey, Mom? Yeah, sweetie? Thanks. Of course. What happened? What? The front's all dented. Oh, that. It was nothing. I just... I hit a curb the other day. I don't know. Have fun with Parker. See ya later. It's crazy. Hmm. Hey, Steve. Morning cup of joe? What? No. Haven't you heard? Heard what? Alice was in a horrible accident last night. She's in the hospital. Is she gonna be okay? Well, she's in critical condition but the doctors are expecting for her to make a full recovery. Well, that's good at least. Some maniac hit her with their car. She's pretty shaken up. A drunk driver? No. Alice thinks that it was intentional. Calculated. That sounds a bit farfetched. Why would anyone do that? Yeah, well, I believe Alice. Well, maybe once she feels better, she'll realize that's a little paranoid. Well... the detectives... Detectives? Yes. Two detectives were assigned to the hit and run to see what happened. I'm sure they'll find something. Let's hope. Yeah. None of this is making any sense. Yeah, man, the last couple weeks have been crazy. There's no way Kate had weed. Are you guys still talking about that? It's just weird. And now Principal Evans is in the hospital. - What? - Someone hit her with their car last night. She's in critical condition. Do they know who did it? Not yet. Listen, some of us were gonna write a card for her, drop it off at the hospital, if you wanna come. Look, Ben, you're a great guy but Parker and I are hooking up. Oh. I was just... I'm not trying to be mean, I just thought you should know. Thanks for showing me around, but I found my group now. Yeah. Anytime. Damn, that's cold. Did she really just do that? Sorry, man, that's rough. Take one and pass them down. As most of you know, Alice is in the hospital. I've been told she's on the mend but until then, I've been nominated as acting principal in her stead. In this packet, you'll find a revised school budget and updated procedures for the teachers, students, staff, and visitors. This is disrespectful. Alice has been in the hospital a day. What was that, Paula? Uh... nothing. Sorry. Oh, you know what? That reminds me. From here on out, there will be no tuna fish sandwiches in the faculty lounge. It stinks up the whole place. I'm sure you'll be able to find something else to munch on, right? It's... just hold on. Don't you think this is a bit premature? I mean, Alice can be back in a couple of weeks. Yeah, well, the school board made it clear that until Alice is back, I'm the principal and things will be done my way. Hello? It's the hospital. Ah. Okay, that sounds great. I'll be right there. Alice is accepting visitors now. I'll go with you. The doctor said I'll recover. But that I'm lucky to be alive. It's just horrible, Alice. Look, if there's anything you want us to do, please let us know. Yeah, and don't worry about Troy, I've got everything covered. Thanks, Lydia. You just take as long as you need to recover. You don't have to stress. I'm gonna go grab some coffee. Can I get you guys anything? I'm good. Okay. I'm so sorry this happened to you. Being in a terrible accident like... This wasn't an accident. I told you, I was targeted. I just don't understand. Why would anybody do something like this to you of all people? Someone who wants what I have. You don't think she's capable... Steve... we've been colleagues and friends for a long time. Promise me you'll look into it. I will need proof. But I'll get it. Another thing. Kate Wheeler's mother called. She was really upset. I hadn't had time to finish the investigation. I'm on it. Figured I'd get you one just in case you changed your mind. Careful, it's hot. I sincerely hope they find whoever did this to you. - Mom? - What is it, sweetie? Did you hurt Principal Evans? What are you talking about? Everyone was staring at me in the halls after class. Did you ever stop to think that maybe it's because you're with Parker now? You posted a photo. You know gossip like that travels fast. It's a good thing! They're just jealous! Was it you? Really? I'm gonna need you to calm down. You always say we don't keep secrets. What did you do? Oh, she'll be fine. It's just some minor injuries. It's nothing permanent. Besides, you should be thanking me. I did it for you. No, you did it for yourself. The principal controls the school. Alice has access to all the systems! This way, I can ensure that you become homecoming queen. You'll be set for life! Mom, you sound crazy. Ellie-Belly, getting Kate suspended, that was your idea, remember? I know, but I... But what? It was your master plan! Alice was onto us. I didn't have a choice! I didn't think anyone was gonna get hurt. Well, maybe you aren't thinking big picture. You want a good life? Yes, but not... If you're having second thoughts, I can turn myself in, but you'll get in trouble too, and then all of our hard work will be for nothing. Just when things were going so well with you and Parker. Life isn't fair. Things aren't just given to us. We have to take to get what we want, and we can't let anything get in the way of that, right? Isn't that what we've learned? - I guess. - You guess? No, you're right. So what do you wanna do? I want to win homecoming queen by any means necessary. That's my girl. Elle? - Elle? - Yeah? I was just rallying everyone to come watch you play. Oh, that'll be awesome. Are you okay? I left my chem book in class. I should grab it before the match. - Oh my God. - Are you okay? What's going on? What's going on? Oh my God, how did this happen? I don't know. She's great. Let's go, Elle! You played really well! Nice. Thanks, guys, for coming. It really means a lot. It's what friends are for. Besides, I was really dreading studying for Mr. Lee's test, so, procrastination is the name of the game. You know, my mom can help with that. What do you mean? Like with your grades. I really don't want another tutor. She can literally change your grades. What? - Yeah. - How? She just logs into the computer and she changes them. She would do that? Yeah, she's totally chill. Parker knows. Hmm. And... consider it done. Wait, you texted her just now? Yeah. Isn't that illegal or something? It's not hurting anyone. Well, do you think she could help Kate? Why would she do that? Because there was obviously some kind of mistake. And you said she's cool, right? Yeah, but Kate was suspended for three weeks. That's like a vacation. Not for Kate, she loves school. She could've been expelled. Yeah, well, your mom should at least let her go to homecoming; it's gonna be a little weird when she wins and she's not there. - What? - Yeah. People are still voting for Kate to be queen. They feel bad for her that she got suspended, so they're voting "in absentia" or whatever. She has an even better chance of winning now. Oh, I didn't... I didn't know you could win in absentia. Um... do you guys wanna get some dinner or something? Uh, actually, uh, we have plans... Plans with Kate. Oh. Well, have fun. Thanks. Bye. You've barely touched your pizza. I know, I haven't been able to eat. I'm really worried, guys. Hey, it'll work out. They'll find out who did this to you, I'm sure of it. Oh, I know who did it. I'm worried what they'll do next. - Who? - Elle, and her mom. Hey, I don't think Elle would do that. Why not? I mean, she's practically taken my place, I mean, hanging out with you guys, running for homecoming queen. Do you have any proof? No, but... she bought weed from you, and then, suddenly, weed turns up in my locker? Well, there's no way to prove that was from me, right? That could've been from anywhere. I know, I just... have a really bad feeling about it all. Sweetheart, sorry to interrupt. This is for you. - Who is it? - Mr. Lee. Why is he calling? He's conducting the investigation while Mrs. Evans is in the hospital, and he has some questions for you. May I help you? Um... no. Well, then, what are you doing in my office? It's not your office. This is Alice's office. Not anymore. Uh, I was just gathering some things to bring to her at the hospital. Hmm. We both know she should be resting and getting better, not worried about work. You're right. Sorry. And hey, Steve, feel free to ask me next time. I'm here to help. All right. See ya around. Lydia? What are you doing here? I just had a couple things I wanted to run by you. Well, you could've called. It's after visiting hours. I know, but it's sort of urgent. What is it? I found Steve snooping around in my office, and now the school credit card has gone missing. Now, I think it's been stolen. You're not implicating Steve, are you? I can't be too sure, so I had no choice but to file a report. Yeah. Steve wouldn't do that. It must have been misplaced. Okay, well, I just wanted to let you know. And one more thing: If you have questions about me, ask. Don't have Steve do your bidding. We're both grown women. We should be able to discuss these things without getting a teacher involved. Oh, these darn pillows. Gosh, if you don't come in with a sore neck, you sure leave with one. I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm afraid it's after visiting hours. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Okay, no need, um, I'll see you later. You can come back tomorrow. Oh, hi, sweetie. I didn't think you'd be home. Figured you'd be with Parker or your new friend. Nope, they went to go visit Kate. I wasn't invited. Why not? Her mom is letting her have a couple people over for dinner. Well, Mrs. Wheeler sounds like a bad mom. If you were suspended, I'd keep your butt in your room. I wouldn't be inviting people over for dinner. Everyone feels bad for her. Kate is going to win homecoming queen. I did everything you said. I'm number one on the tennis team, I'm dating the coolest guy in school, and I'm in the popular group, and I'm still not going to win. Stop worrying, sweetie. Are you even listening? I was able to change your grades, wasn't I? I'm the principal now. I can do whatever I want! Get up, we're going shopping. What, right now? Yeah, department stores are open for a couple more hours, and someone needs a new homecoming dress for her big night. Can we afford it? Since when do you turn down a shopping spree?

Yeah, go on. Get your beauty sleep. - Thanks, Mom. - Mm-hmm. Thank you! Hey, um, you wanted to see me? Oh, yes. Please sit down. I'm good. I'd rather stand. Plus I have a class to teach in a minute. Well, about that. Been doing some shopping lately? Excuse me? I just got off the phone with the bank, um... School credit card has gone missing. Some fraudulent charges came through last night, the same night you were rummaging around in here. So, do you see the bind this puts me in? No, I don't. And I wasn't in here snoopin'. I was getting some things for Alice. Don't play dumb with me, Steve. We both know what you were doing. And with this credit card on my hands, I mean, I have to suspend you. You... you can't do that. Actually, I can. I briefed the subs on what you've been teaching. Fine, do whatever you want. Suspend me. I didn't know I needed your permission for that, but thank you, I intend to. Look, you're not gonna stop me. I know you had something to do with Alice's accident. I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna take you down. Have a nice day. You're looking a whole lot better. Thanks. I'm on the mend. That's good. That's good. What is it? I've been wanting to talk to you about something, but I didn't want to bring it up if you're... if it was too much for you. I feel fine. I've been doing some digging. I wanted to talk to the principal that wrote the recommendation letter for Lydia. And? The receptionist told me that he died ten years ago. He hasn't even worked at the school in over two decades. That can't be. He wasn't even the principal when Lydia was working there. In fact, I had trouble finding anyone who even knew who Lydia was. Well, if he didn't write the letter, who did? You okay, sweetie? What? Yeah, yeah. I'm... I just... I don't know. You can tell me. Uh, it's Kate. She's sad to miss her senior homecoming, and she wants to be with us, and we've been friends since middle school. Well, I don't know what she's saying now, but she told me that homecoming was just a stupid dance. So I'm sure she'll be fine. I don't know what to do, I feel like I should... I feel like I should be with Kate. She's all alone. Don't you dare leave my daughter, you punk. What? You have the best girl in the school. Ellie is so much better than Kate, and more than that, you committed to being her date. So you are going to follow through with that commitment, and you are going to enjoy it. Do you understand me? - Yeah. - Good. Coming! Oh, let me get my phone ready! Okay, it's recording! Wow, you look... gorgeous. Absolutely perfect! Mom, don't cry! I can't help it. The day is finally here. Look at you two. Such a beautiful couple. Oh! Oh, that must be your friends. Hey, party people! The limo's right here. Hey, Becca! Cute dress. It's fun. I love yours, so sweet! Oh, thanks, it was my mom's. Oh, I love that. Okay. You guys look beautiful! Say, "Cheese!" All right, a crazy one. Check this out, yeah. I love this dress. Over here! One, two, three! Beautiful! - You ready? - Yeah, yeah. I couldn't have done this without you. I love you so much. Of course, sweetie. I love you too. Just you and me. Against the world. This is the best day of my life. And it's about to get even better. Have fun. ♪ I'm a star in ascension ♪ ♪ Give me your attention ♪ ♪ Wannabes, frenemies... ♪♪ Everybody havin' a good time tonight? I said are we havin' a good time tonight? And now, Senior Class President Benjamin Greene will present the winner of homecoming queen. Woo, go Ben G.! This is it. Slick! Slick! Thank you, Dean. And now, the moment you've all been waiting for. Our homecoming queen this year is... Ellie Campbell! I told you! - Congratulations. - Thanks. Let's go, come on. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Lydia Campbell? Yes? You're under arrest for embezzlement, fraud, planting evidence, and attempted murder. What?! There's... there's gotta be a mistake. Is this a joke? Turn around and put your hands behind your back. This is a misunderstanding, I'm the principal. Turn around or you will be charged with obstruction of the law. Mom? It's gonna be okay, Ellie. There's obviously been a mistake. We'll straighten this all out at the station. Enjoy your big night, okay, sweetie? Promise me. And you're Ellie Campbell? Yes? You could enjoy your night in jail; you're under arrest too. What? No! No, that's my daughter. No, get off of me! That's my baby!
