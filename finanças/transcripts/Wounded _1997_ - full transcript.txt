- Nice shot. - Big target. I thought you almost lost her. Three. Two. One. - Locked. - Locked. Don... Don! I got a signal. It's not our fault, you know. I bet you 20 bucks... ...that headquarters doesn't do a damn thing about it. You're on. - That's a sucker bet. - Yeah, I know. We'll head back down to the river tomorrow. See if we can find any trace of the guys that did this. - Hey, Don! - Hey! - Julie! - Hi. This is David Boyd, my Field Operations Commander. And Special Agent Ashton with the FBI. - What's going on? - We need you guys... ...to direct us out to the kill site! We'll need your tracking receiver! Bring your overnight gear! We're leaving in five minutes! That looks like about $50'000 worth of product here stateside. You know, the more we crack down on these sons of bitches... ...the more money they make. Illegal animal trade raked in about $2 billion last year. Commander Boyd's absolutely right. We got poachers out here operating with choppers... ...night vision equipment. They've got all the latest high tech tools. Which brings us to you guys. That's how they're tracking your bears... ...through your radio collars. What have you got up here? - Maybe... - 100, 150 collared bears up here. Two hundred and three. At this rate, they could clean you out in a few months. Commander Boyd will be in charge of the ground operation... ...while Agent Ashton and I head back to the base... ...and keep tabs on incoming information. We'll patrol during the day. Cold camp at night. I got a line on him. He appears to be alone. Forty five yards from me, seventy five from you. Can you ID him? Not positively. He's got a bear in his sights. He's going in for the kill. - Come on, let's go. - Hey. It's two years max now. He'll do ten if we let him have one. There's got to be another way. Just sit down and shut up. Right now, he's just another guy walking in the woods. He's in possession of illegal animal parts... - That's enough. - On my signal. Shit, he may have noticed me. Lay down your weapon! Federal Agents, you're under arrest! Stay down! I think we got him. Move in. - Which way would he head? - To the river. It's the quickest way out. Two teams. You take the lady and head up over the ridge. You come with me and Powell. And if I get my way, you won't have a job when you get back. Eagan. Sitrep. Eagan. Waring, state your position. Waring, do you copy? This is Boyd. I need backup here. Copy. ETA 20 minutes. Freeze! I'll gut him. Right to the bone. You ease off the hammer. Throw it right here at my feet. Don't do it, Jules. Do it, Jules. You can live, and he can live. I promise. Good girl. Well, at least you know she loved you, Game Warden. No! Go on. Go. We've got to take a shift to the right! She's got a tension pneumothorax! Shit, we've got v-fib. Defibbing, 200 joules. Stand clear! - Shit. - It's okay. We got sinus tachy! Alert the trauma team! We've got incoming wounded! Multiple gunshot wounds to the chest! She's bad, Jack. Gunshot wound to the left apex... ...and then penetrating into the right thigh. She has a hemopneumothorax... - Hey, Don! - Hey! Julie. This is David Boyd. And Special Agent Ashton of the FBI. What's this all about? We need you guys to direct us out to the kill site. Bring your overnight gear! We leave in five minutes! We'll see if we can find any trace of the guys... ...that did this. Right now, he's just another guy walking in the woods. Can you ID him? I'll gut him, right to the bone. You won't have a job when you get back. Hi. I'm Dr.Voight. Okay if I call you Julie? Don? You were the only survivor, Julie. And assuming no complications... ...you've come through our body shop better than I thought. How long have I been out? They brought you in three days ago. Look. There are a lot of serious people... ...who want to talk to you. No chance until I say so. And I won't say so until you say so. I should be dead. Actually, you would be. The position of your heart is what saved you. "Situs inversus totalis" You were born with all your organs on the opposite side. Now, the first bullet tore up your thigh. But there was no damage. The second bullet passed right through. Punctured a lung. And broke a rib on its way out. You were very lucky. I'll be back when you're rested. He wanted... He wanted to be cremated. Of course. I don't have time for this. And I've got a woman hanging by a thread in there. You're going to have to wait for your description. So, what's your perspective, Doctor? Well, the exit wound is granulating really well. We should have some healthy scar tissue... ...in the next couple of weeks. Diseases? No, your wound edges tear really well approximate. That's just... Oh, I didn't mean to wake you. Eric Ashton, FBI. We met on the chopper. You let us go up there not knowing what to expect. No one knew what to expect, Miss Clayton. That's why we need your help. We want to get the men who did this. Man. Just one man. We'd like you to describe him for us. I don't remember what he looks like. Look. We've waited more than a week to talk to you. - Now, we all share your pain. - You know nothing about my pain. It's Don's life insurance policy. You're the sole beneficiary. Maybe I was misinformed. But I was under the impression that you and... Well, I thought you'd want to do it. For him. I said I can't remember. Let's cut the crap, huh? We all want the same thing here. And it's really got squat to do with justice. Now, you seem to be the only person... ...who can tell us what this guy looks like. I get an artist in here in 30... It's our man, all right. Up in those mountains without a hard location... ...gentlemen, we're screwed. He's got over 50'000 acres of wilderness to hide in. It's not going to be easy, no matter where he is. No clues, no prints, and a uncooperative witness. If it's who we think it is... ...and he knows this girl is alive, he just may come to us. Room 204. The lock's broke. You got an ice machine? Second floor. - Mr.Lee. How are you? - Good. Heard you took a bullet this time. Yeah. Nothing serious. Listen, uh, the death of those two officers... ...that's bad news. It's a couple of game wardens, Lee. Nothing to get worked up about. The people who use this product do so for medicinal purposes. - I know that. - Knowing that human lives... ...were taken to acquire them defeats the purpose. So, you don't tell them. What's your point? All right. We've got a bigger problem. The woman. She's alive. And that, my friend, makes you something... ...of an endangered species yourself. There's no way she's alive, Lee. And if she is, I can fix that. - I'm sure you can. - Uh-huh. Unfortunately, this whole business, well... Our relationship has to come to an end. Whoa. Hold on a second, partner. We had a deal, Lee. Hey, come on. Look, I'll see what I can do. I'll discuss it with my colleagues... ...and I'll get back to you. You see? That's not that hard. I knew I could count on you. Looking forward to hearing from you, Lee. Hi, there. Here we go, special delivery. I brought you a change if you feel so inclined. Although, I'll be the first to admit... ...the New York fashion department we are not. I'll be back to check on you a little later. You feeling any better? Not much for conversation these days, are you? If it helps, you look great. Here we go. Here, I'll take that. If you need anything else, just buzz. Nurse. What do you live for? What you're doing is really dangerous, you know. It's been seven weeks now, Julie. Half of all healing comes from within. You can withdraw so far inside yourself... ...there is no coming out. Now, you have to work with us... ...you are not responsible. You're helping them. That's normal. Most people would. I should have died with him. Sorry to disturb you, Doctor. There's a telephone call for her. It's at one of the patients' phones. Julie, why don't you take that call... ...and I'll see you again tomorrow. Hello? Did you get my card? You know, there are either too many coincidences... ...in this world, or... ...you are just one lucky game warden. How are you feeling? Heh. You must have one hell of a high tolerance for pain. Me? No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Thanks for asking though. - My shoulder is still a little... - I hope it fucking kills you. Now, Julie, let's play nice, huh? I understand how you feel... ...all cooped up in there... ...like a bird in a cage. That cop always outside your door. - Where are you? - I'm close. Very close. Someplace neither of us belong though. I bet you miss it, just like I do. The thin air. Bambi and all her friends. Where the wild things are. I want you to stay focused, Game Warden. 'Cause that's the only way you're ever going to find me. Isn't that what you want? That is what Julie wants, isn't it? Or Julie would have given... ...the FBI a terrific likeness of her old friend. That is, if you can remember what I look like. But you know, Julie, I'm afraid I can't take that chance. A good hunter never leaves his prey wounded. It's inhumane. So, why don't you come and get me? I tried, Julie. I tried. I'd really like to end your pain for you. But the place is just crawling with your FBI vermin. Tell me something, Julie. What part about Don do you miss the most? Call security. Security. Who's in there? Detective Rollins, Police Department. Okay. Sorry, sir. We've got a patient gone AWOL. There's no smoking in here, sir. Goddamn wise guy rent-a-cop. Take it easy. I'm a cop. Let me go! Let me go! I'm a cop. Take it easy. Calm down. Just calm down. No. All right. Just calm down. Please don't. Please. - Stop. - Take it easy. No. Don't. Stop. All right. Give it up. There. Hey, back off! It's all right. Just having a little talk here. She's ready to go back to her room now. Aren't you? Huh? She's ready to go back to her room now. Hm? Okay. Good girl. Don't say anything you might want to write... ...in your diary someday. Why didn't you tell them? You mean about, uh... Some things... Some things are personal. Who are you? My name's Rollins. I'm a cop. A cop with an empty gun? That's the deal if I want my pension. You're in treatment. I had that same gun to my head too. Only then it was loaded. Just when I thought there were no answers, no way out... ...I found out I wasn't alone. That's why I'm here. So, why are you telling me? 'Cause I believe... I believe what you give out is what you get back. You take care of yourself. Guy's name is Rollins. He's a local cop. - Keep tabs on him. - Mm-hm. Hey. Nice tax bracket. - Hey, don't do that. - Aw, fucking take a break. Hey, come on. Look. Stop it. Hey, didn't I see you in an episode of Hee Haw? Take off, you freak. You miss me? I haven't heard from you. We need to talk about our arrangement, Mr.Lee. I can't do that. That's a big word, for a little guy. What is this, Corinthian leather? - I'd hate to mess it up. - All right. - A couple days. - 24 hours. Okay? Good. That's a nice suit. Interesting. Down with the old, up with the new. Yeah, I got ears. I ain't deaf. Rollins. Yeah? Who? My name's Julie. When you wanted to die, why didn't you do it? I know what happened. I read the report. But why don't you tell me what really happened? It was a chance to get some poachers. And everyone died quickly. But Don... Someone special? He killed him after he said he wouldn't. Yeah, I used to be scared too. But I turned it into anger. I took the hits, I survived. But I kept the anger. How long ago? I don't know. I don't remember. Probably when I was still in uniform. The other day with your gun, I wasn't afraid. It's scary not to be afraid. I was wounded four times. And I killed five people, all in the line of duty. And I watched a lot of good people I know die. It used to all matter, but I couldn't handle it. So, I started hitting the bottle. - They think I'm crazy. - Aren't we all? But let me tell you something. Remember when I told you I didn't want to kill myself? Now, I'm going to tell you why I wanted to. Basically... I'm screwed up because I... I got to really like shooting people. They were all bad guys. But it's a thin line, isn't it? I don't have any magic answers for you, but I do know one thing. You have to save your own life. And if you're gonna pursue this thing... ...sooner or later you're gonna lose. I'm ready to leave. You look really good, Julie. - Thanks. I'm feeling good. - That's great. ...have both okay-ed your release from the hospital. Field status? Well, they were thinking in more... ...of an administrative position. That is, unless you can pass the physical. I probably need a little more time for that. So, can I help you get the poacher? Uh, the FBI is taking care of that. All they wanted from you was a description... ...in the first place. But that's out of our hands. Well, that's behind us now. The department's really... Well, I'm really looking forward to having you back. Thanks. Rollins, it's Julie. I guess you're on your way. So, I'll see you in the front. He's on his way. I'm gonna get my stuff. Information. Yes. Uh, can you hang on a second, please? Excuse me. Excuse me. - Are you Julie Clayton? - Yeah. I have a telephone call for you. Just one moment, please. I'll transfer you. You can take it right over here. Hey, where are you? You're not much for small talk, are you, Julie? If I told you where I was, would you come for me? Try me. You look angry, Julie. Where are you? No. Not that way. There you go. That's more like it. Hi, I'm here to pick up Julie Clayton. - Julie Clayton? - Yeah. Uh, I think she just left. Didn't you just call her? No. - Don't move. - Whoa, he's got a gun. - Oh, God. - Local cop. Sorry about that. Is this standard procedure for local police? Maybe if your department would start telling me... ...what's going on, we could catch this guy. Can I go now? What the hell do you think you're doing? Just getting some fresh air. Well, welcome to paradise. Come on in. Boy, don't move. Be quiet. Sit. She's a cop. This is a cop. How you doing, big guy, hm? How are you? Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. His name is Brutus. I suggest you get acquainted with him. - You want a drink or something? - Something. You get used to it. You had him long? Yeah, for quite a while. He was with the K-9 unit. His handler was a... ...was a real good friend of mine. Then one day Lori never came home from work... ...'cause some asshole had a bad day and wanted to kill a cop. I'm sorry. Well, at least he's come to terms with it. That's what he wants you to think. Oh, that's just some research and reports... ...into the illegal animal parts trade. I put the word out to a couple of buddies of mine... ...and they're keeping their eyes open for me. Fascinating stuff, isn't it? I'm... I'm sorry. Got any loaded guns around? - Forget it. - I don't like being bait. All right, let's just cut the crap. You're pissed off, and you want a shot at this guy. But the FBI are watching you until they get a shot at him. So, why don't you just give them the information they want... ...and get on with your life, huh? - No. - Why? Because I don't think you're in the right frame of mind, okay? You think I might do something to myself? Oh, geez. Rollins, I trust you. I need you to trust me. I should at least be able to protect myself. See anything you like? Oh, yeah, that one makes a real mess. Is it like the one you carried? Cleaner. "Detective Rollins receives commendation" - Good morning. - Yeah. What's left of it? - You sleep okay? - I don't know how you do it. Like I said, you get used to it. I threw out your foods of the world mold collection. You better not touch my TV dinners. Sorry. Freezer burn. You expecting company? It makes me feel better. I read about you last night. Yeah, well, don't believe everything you read. What the hell is that? Jesus... Yeah, Rollins. Oh, yeah. Hi. Oh, yeah? Thanks for calling me in on this one, Bill. Hey, no problem. My appreciation, man. So, you know, one of our guys, a dog handler... ...was, uh, taking his dog to sniff out... ...this new incoming shipment. So, he comes to this export warehouse... ...and the dog starts going ape shit. He lets the dog do his thing, and check this out. - It's chocolate. - It's not chocolate. You called me all the way down here for chocolate? It's a new trick they've developed... ...to hide the scent from the dogs. Look. Rollins, I didn't call the cops on this one. You owe me a beer. Look. Nobody's accusing anyone of anything here. My client knows nothing about any shipment... ...of illegal animal parts. You either release him immediately, or charge him. Well, the Bureau was hoping your client would cooperate... ...so it wouldn't come to that. We want to locate the whereabouts... ...of a particular supplier. My client has nothing to do with criminal activity. Save the bullshit for court, Counselor. I'm after a murderer of federal employees. The rule book doesn't mean shit to me. I want this guy. How does your client explain the animal parts we found? Mr.Lee runs a large company with many employees. It's impossible to know how any alleged items... ...appeared in any such crate. You call this alleged? But he doesn't have to respond to that... ...or any other questions... ...until he's been officially charged. So, unless you're prepared to charge my client... ...we'll be on our way. Ugh. They're all the same. Lawyers. It's true. Well, welcome to the justice system. Tell me about it. - Hey, Rollins? - Yeah. - I'm gonna use the washroom. - All right. - Thanks. - All right. I'll see you then. Don't worry about anything. She is something else. Ah, just forget it, Stu. You couldn't get lucky in a women's prison... ...with a fist full of pardons. - Oh, I don't mean for me. - I'm just... - All right, all right, seriously. I really want to thank you for letting us sit in there. Oh, no big deal. Eric the asshole almost had a hemorrhage, but he'll live. Yeah, well... Who is this guy, anyway? Oh, he's some fly-in from the home office. You know the type. Bound for glory. Yeah, well, if he's here... ...just how hot is this guy you're looking for? Put it this way. If he comes into town... ...looking for your friend, we'll be ready. How the hell did you hook her anyway? I'm didn't hook her. It's a long story. Yeah, it always is. Yeah? What did you mean by that? Just that you're always looking for causes. - Watch your back. - Yeah, yeah. I mean it, Nick. Hey, take it easy. What the hell were you saying about trust? How did you find me? You're not the only one who saw the matchbook. What do you think I am? Put that damn thing away, and let's get out of here. Hey, come back here. I'm talking to you. Don't you ever try to pull a stunt like this again. - You hear me? - Ah, here we go again. Glad they didn't find out about that piece you're carrying. My ass would really be in a sling. - Oh, Rollins. - I'm putting my pension... ...on the line for you. I don't believe what goes on inside that peabrain of yours. Rollins, you said to turn it into anger. Never mind what I said. You can't ago around banging your head on everything. Well, I'm sorry. I did what I had to do. - If you don't understand... - Ah, boo-hoo. Don't give me that I'm sorry you don't understand crap. - You don't understand, Rollins. - Look. You're with me, and what you do affects me. Well, I certainly don't want to affect you. So why don't you go back to an easy end to your short time... ...and I'll be out of your hair. - Fine. Fine! What are you looking at? You traitor. - Record it? - Yeah. Remember, Julie... You mess with me, and I'll mess with you. I think we got him on the phone. This is my living, Julie. Where do you get off... ...thinking you can steal a man's livelihood? That's not a livelihood. You think what you do is any better, huh? Tell me something, Julie. Have you ever culled a herd of elk? You ever participated in a controlled kill... ...or whatever you bureaucrats call your little exercises... ...in resource management? Because it's all right when you've got a badge. - Is that it? - Someone has to be in control. Hey, you're preaching to the converted here, Julie. I'll tell you something, Julie, I believe in the individual. And in his God-given right to control his own life. Killing unprotected animals. That takes courage. More than some guy who buys a bear tag. But that's all right in your book, isn't it? Well, if I had it my way... "If I had it my way, if I had it my way." This whole control issue... ...Julie, it's got me a little worried. I think you're happy just to sit there... ...and bitch about not having any control. And me, I take control, Julie. They got a pinpoint, downtown. Yates and Borden. We got a lock! Julie... I guess you know your station got closed, huh? Right now, nobody's up there guarding your precious animals. That's how little control you have. I'm a hunter, Julie. I take what I want. I travel light. I live simple. It's in my blood. And my people have been in those mountains longer... ...than you bureaucrats have existed. We didn't eat by a mandated season, Julie. We ate because we were hungry. Gall bladders? Your family had a strange appetite. No, sweetheart. We ate the meat. Now they can't pay enough... ...for the parts we used to throw away. To them it's medicine. Who the fuck are you to tell them any different? It is my fucking living, Julie. Has my own government helped me? No. They sent undercover agents in to come and hunt me. And you kill them and anyone who gets in your way. Did you ever read the Bible, Julie? Eye for an eye. Sounds reasonable. It is. So, you, uh, coming after me, sweetie? You know, I'd like that. Just you and me. How about it? You come for me. Oh, I will. Don't you worry. - Hey, Nick. - Thanks for coming over, Stu. - What the hell is going on? - We got nothing from the hotel. No fingerprints, no ID. Nothing traceable. This guy's a ghost. He's got the same M.O. ... ...as whoever shot that ranger up in Washington... ...a couple years back. Apparently, they were hot on his trail about a year ago. They sent a team out to track him down. Not one of them came out alive. Yeah, yeah, I read all of that in the report. Look, Nick. There's something you should know. The leader of that team was Ashton's best buddy. College friend. He's had a hard on for this guy ever since. How'd you track him here? - Excuse me? - How'd you know he was here? They put a tap on your phone. - You guys tapped my line? - Oh, no, no, no. Not me. They did. You don't know this? So then, she talked to him? You don't know about this. Hey. You know, I've been straight with you right down the line. But you lied to me right from the beginning. What are you talking about? It's all on tape, Julie. Everything. At least you could have been straight with yourself. But, oh, no, not you. Not Julie Clayton. All you want is blood. Whatever it takes. Just as long as you get to drop the hammer first, right? And then what? - I'll let you know. - Well, thank you very much. And while you're at it, why don't you put... ...a little thought into what's gonna happen after? Are you gonna help me, or what? Oh yeah, I'm going to help you. What's that? It's a bus ticket. I talked to your boss. They want you to report back to work. And I want my gun back. What do you think he'll do? I don't know. Head for the hills, if he's smart. I guess there's not much else he can do. No, I guess not. You know, a guy like that disappears into the hills... ...a couple of years go by, and it's like nothing ever happened. Yeah. Might be a good thing. Here's to whatever it is. Friends are rare. How about to, uh, fellow travelers? Okay. And please, do yourself a favor. Just forget about this guy. Let it go. Or you'll end up like me. We have a problem, Game Warden. Just you and me, Julie! And the burnout. Wish I could stick around forever. I got bears to harvest. Not as much fun as harvesting game wardens, I promise. We have to get out. Uh-uh. That's what he wants. I love room-to-room. Rollins. Rollins... He's gone out back. Get Brutus. Rollins? Just remember what I told you. Just let it go. No! He's DOA. Internal bleeding. Wiped the place clean. No prints. Lost his trail a couple of blocks away. In and out like a ghost. Julie, are you out there? I know you're listening. I know you can hear me, sweetie. You see, Jules, you and me, we're not that different, are we? Welcome to my world. It's peaceful, isn't it? You know, Julie, everybody else has let this thing go... ...the Feds, Fish and Wildlife. Everybody has moved on. Why can't you? They'll come after you. No, they won't, Julie. Number one fact, nobody gives a shit about poachers. They'll all be hiding in their cities, in their offices. I'm just too dangerous, Jules. It all comes down to the way you want it to be. I have no choice. Julie... It's not that easy to kill someone. Not for people like you, anyway. Death. Death is your enemy. Death is my friend. Close your eyes, Julie. See my face. See your finger on the trigger. What do you do? You choke. You had your chance, Julie. And you couldn't do it. Not even to save Don's life. Well, well, well, my little game warden. You're to be commended once again, Julie. Right on my tail. Right on time. I see you found my stash. Isn't this fun? Julie... ...I have a proposition for you. What do you say we call it a truce? Hm? We move on. There's honor in that, Game Warden. Look at me. I got a new buyer... ...and a whole new set of faces. And let's face it, you don't have the balls. Because that's what it comes down to, Julie. That's the final act. Can you pull the trigger? Could you slide that knife in me? So tell me... ...how does it feel to be the hunted? Julie. Julie. You suck.
