I thought no one lived on this island. Oh, that's only the automatic lighthouse. We can see it from the farm. Grandpa says there's no one here but the birds and some wild ponies. Come on. Let's go. Where you going? To explore. Now let's go. We ought to wait on the beach like grandpa told us. We got plenty of time before he comes back. What is it, an old Indian bow? Bet you I know. Bet it's the rib bone from the hull of a ship that's been wrecked and buried here. I'll bet you this is a regular graveyard for... It's just an old piece of wood. Gee, you were the one so anxious to come here. Now you don't want to even explore assateague. Well, I'm going to. I'm going to look for some wild ponies. Paul, look! Get down so they won't see us. Look at that one ahead of the others. Could she be the phantom? The one daddy told us about? And this must be the pied Piper's mare. She's just like he described her. Shh. Don't scare them away. They're going away. They must have known we were here. You think it was her? You think it really was? I know it was her. She's just like daddy told us. Remember what he said about her? She's the only pony he saw on assateague that he really wanted. Do you suppose he knows we just saw the phantom? Maybe sometimes, when they feel like it, they could even come down and ride on the phantom. They could, you know, if they wanted to. Mother...she didn't care for riding much. She liked it all right, but... It wasn't very important to her. Not like it was to dad. Oh, Paul, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could... I mean... The phantom, if we could... Grandpa said I could ride on pony-penning day with him this summer. Fire department wouldn't take less than $100 for her. But if we could earn enough money... hello! It'd be almost like... Hello! Hi. Hi, gramps. When I delivered the game warden to count the birds, guess what. What? What? He gave me this cigar. Well, how do you like the island? Well, we saw some wild ponies and the phantom, too. We're sure it was her, grandpa. Well, it could be. Pied Piper grazes his mares on this side of the island. Hey, where'd you hear about the phantom? Well, dad talked about her. He told us all about her. How about that now? Bob only... Your daddy only saw her once when she was a yearling. She was the first wild pony he really set his mind to have. Hasn't anybody ever caught the phantom on pony-penning day? Nope. She always outrun us, you know? There's one pony has her heart set on staying free. Grandpa... Is it true about the Spanish galleon and the wild ponies, or is it just a legend, like some people say? 'Course it's true. Every one of these ponies in these herds are direct descendants of those Spanish horses. Happened right out there on that reef way back in the early 1600s. You see, the Spaniards had to have horses to tote the gold out of the mines in Peru. The only way they could get the critters was to bring them across the ocean in ships. One of those Spanish galleons got herself caught in a howling northeaster. The wild sea just slapped that galleon silly and finally flung her onto the reef there to turn her into kindling wood. The only thing we know for sure was that when her ribs stove in and the whole ship opened up like a stepped-on strawberry box, her cargo of horses was finally free of the hold and found themselves swimming for their lives. So they came ashore on assateague, and the sweetness of the rain-washed air made them forget the unhappy days they spent penned up. Instead of musty hay, they had the salty taste of marsh grass... strange to them, but wonderful. Best of all, nobody lived here to hinder them none. Nobody at all. White men finally came to live on chincoteague, but they left assateague with the ponies all alone. Did the white men ever try to tame the ponies? Oh, the pioneers on chincoteague... They were too busy to fool around with the wild, thrashing horses. Besides that, the wild ones... They ain't even worth the gentling. Only the youngsters. They're the only ones worthwhile bothering with as far as the gentling goes. Remember that. Hmm? Tide's ebbing. Best we be making home. Grandpa, can I drive the boat? You can take turns. Grandpa? Yeah? How'd pony-penning day start? Oh, long before my time. It's one of the oldest round-ups in America. When did they start swimming the ponies across the channel? That come quite a bit later. Kind of added fun to the whole outing. Grandpa, do they only sell the foals? Only the foals, and some of the yearlings. It's like I said... Only the youngsters are worthwhile bothering about as far as the gentling goes. They sell the foals and yearlings? Yep. How old's the phantom? Oh, I would say, uh... She's about 3 years old now. Well, supposing somebody had the money... shh! Why'd you shush your sister? Well, i...i did it because... Well, she was going to... We kind of planned on... shh! You kind of planned on what? Oh, you! Well, it's a surprise. Yeah. For grandma. Oh, for grandma. Well... Don't they ever let girls ride in the round-up? You'll have plenty to do, helping prepare the food. But I can ride as good as Paul. Don't you think I can, grandpa? Well, that has nothing to do with it. Womenfolk ain't allowed to ride on the round-up. But... I don't want to hear any more about it. Go to bed, dear. Good night, grandma. Night, grandpa. Good night, sleep tight, and don't let the... anything bite. Some nights it's just awful being a girl. Grandpa says I can't ride with you on pony-penning day because womenfolk aren't allowed. I'll bet the phantom wouldn't shy away from another girl. Maybe, because she's a 3-year-old, the fire department won't even sell her. Not even to us? I don't know. You hear what grandpa said? There weren't many that could be gentled after living wild so long. I'll bet we can do it. Paul, I know we can. We're going to have her, Maureen. How will we get the money? I don't know yet, but we're going to own the phantom, and that's a promise. I finished helping grandma with dinner. Are these assateague colts? Yep... Except they were all foaled right here on the farm. Mr. Beebe, how come those wild horses you get in assateague are so small? Never seen one over 13 hands. How much is a hand again? Four inches. Shh. They're small for a couple of reasons... generations of inbreeding, and their diet isn't what you call first class. How much for that one, Mr. Beebe? The small one. $125. I like that Colt best of all. You like them all best of all. Besides, it's grandpa's business selling ponies, and he can't keep them forever. Open the gate, Paul. Might as well gone to assateague and captured one. Wouldn't have been any Wilder, saved myself some money. To begin with, those ponies belong to our fire department. Nobody's allowed to just go over and help himself to a horse. Anyway, it would take more than just one man to pick a foal from a wild herd. The boss stallion would kick you to death. I'll have to spend another 20 just to get somebody to take the fight out of him. You know somebody who can break him real quick? If I did, I wouldn't even speak to him. A good trainer won't break a foal. He'll gentle him. Breaking him's the quick way, but gentle him, that's the sure way. How long will that take? Depends upon you and your children. Just keep talking to him. Horses learn to like the sound of human voices. After a while, they learn to trust you. Now...he's scared. He'll be scared when you get him home. He ain't never rode in a thing like that before. Be kind, be patient with him. After a while, he'll be following you around like a happy hound dog. Tell you something. If you're not happy with this pony in, say, about a month, just haul him back here, and I return your money. I couldn't ask for a better deal. Thanks a lot, Mr. Beebe. Thank you. Bye, now. Mainlanders. Just 'cause a horse is a dumb animal is no reason for its owners to be. Will he bring him back, grandpa, do you think? I don't know. I don't know, Paul. Break him. What are you doing? Think that man will bring him back? Maureen... I been thinking, and if we're going to buy the phantom by pony-penning day, we're going to have to set a course and hold to it. Pony-penning day is only in four months, you know. We can get odd jobs after school, then when school's out for the summer, we can really work. Did you hear what that man said? He'd have to pay 20 extra dollars for the gentling of that Colt. All right, now look. Six of the mares have a Colt apiece. The black has a yearling, and the Chestnut, a suckling. How many do you think grandpa will sell by next July? All but the suckling. That's what I figure. Now, if we could teach them some good manners, maybe halter-break them, bet you people would pay more money for them. Wouldn't they? Maybe they would. Sure, they would. Maybe grandpa would pay us the difference. But don't tell him why we want the money. Sure smells good, ida. Don't you like it? Yes, grandma, it's fine. Then don't let it grow on your plate. Aren't you hungry, dear? Yes, grandma. I mean, yes, I am. Grandma... Do you like mannerly colts? Yes, I do, but I like mannerly grandchildren who eat their supper more. What he means, grandma, if you came to a pony farm to buy a foal, would you choose a gentled one or a wild one? I can just see your grandma crow-hopping along on a wild pony. Not likely to ever see that. 'Course, I'd take the mannerly Colt. Would you pay more money for it? Well, it depends how much more. Well, if it was nice and mannerly, would you pay as much as $10 more? Mm-hmm, think I would. There, you see, grandpa? See what? If Maureen and I halter-break and gentle your colts, could you pay us the $10 extra you'd get for selling them? What for? Must be a secret, Clarence. Tell you something. I never pried a secret out of nobody in my whole life. I'm not going to start poking and prying now. It's a deal. Don't tell me what the money's for until you're ready to spend it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm real glad for what you did, Clarence. Letting them earn some money by gentling the colts may help them get over the loss of Bob and Mary. My land! They got that Colt gentled down already! Gentled nothing. I bet you I know why he's eating out of their hands. Look, grandpa. Look how he eats out of my hand. Give me the sugar. Both of you. Don't feed the foal sugar. But he loves it, grandpa. 'Course he does, but let me tell you something, and don't you forget it. A foal that develops a sweet tooth will turn into a nipper. Sooner or later, he'll bite the hand that sugared him. I didn't know that. Well, you know it now. No sugar, understand? Yes, grandpa. All right, now. Take him inside with his mama. Ok. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. My filly's already a lady. I told you. It takes a girl to teach a girl. Paul... Stop fooling around with those foals and get ready for school. Yes, grandma. Yes, grandma. Did you make your bed? No. Gee, neither did I. Clarence, I've never seen two youngsters go so crazy about horses. What did you expect? They're beebes. It's in their blood. They're learning fast, I got to say. I know, but there are other things just as important to learn. More important. They're going to learn them, too. Ida, give them some time. They've been only here for a few short months. Living with us is different for them. Don't interfere with my trying to teach them their duties. We're not going to spoil them like some grandparents do. Yes, mother. Paul, Maureen. Yes, grandma? Your school clothes. Your nice school clothes. Just look what you've done to them. You think I'd let you wear dirty clothes like that? I just got them a little dusty, grandma. Go upstairs and change. I won't have anybody in this town thinking we don't care how you look. But first, sit down. Both of you. You're not on vacation like the other times when you came visiting. You live here now. It's different than what you were used to in Philadelphia. You got to learn that on a place like this each of us has to do his and her share. You think your grandpa and I have given you too many chores? No, grandma. No, grandma. Each have your own room, which you're supposed to keep tidy. I'll make my bed right away, grandma. I will, too,grandma. Keep those halters in the tack room, not in your bedrooms. I'm not through. Maureen, you forgot to gather the eggs last night. I had to do it after you went to bed. Grandma, I'll clean the henhouse out when I get home after school. You can play with the foals all you like, but not until after your chores. Is that clear? Now go clean up for school. See? He's as gentle as a kitten. My boy will be real happy with him. It's worth the extra money to get a gentle one, Mr. Beebe. I reckon it is. Good luck with the pony. Thank you. Well, I don't think I have two 5s. Is a 10-spot ok? Yes, fine. Yeah, fine. You really earned it. I didn't expect to get $100 for that pony. The man gave me $125 without batting an eye. Hey. Gee, isn't it pretty? I'll say. Where are we going to keep it? I found this in the barn. It's an old tobacco pouch of grandpa's. He doesn't need it anymore. It'll hold a lot. Where will we keep that? Well... It belongs to both of us. It's to buy the phantom with, and she'll belong to us. That's right. So... I was going to keep it in my bureau, but if you want to keep it in your room, it's all right with me. You keep it in here. Which one shall we gentle next? Oh, I guess the brown and white foal. Ok. We can get a lot done tomorrow. It's Saturday. I'll be glad when school's out. It just interferes with everything. You children get to bed! Yes, grandma! Yes, grandma! Gee, just think. Only $90 left to get. Good night, Paul. Good night. Sleep well, phantom. All the horses are there, so he's not out riding. Maureen, what did you plan to do today? Nothing but what I told you. We were going to start breaking the brown and white filly after finishing our chores. Clarence, I'm getting worried. Oh, ida, there's nothing to worry about. Paul! Hey, Mr. Beebe! Mr. Beebe, brought your boat back. Aw, don't be afraid, girl. I won't hurt you. Hey, are you Paul Beebe? Yes, sir. You all right? Yes, sir. Well, you sure scared the pants off your folks. Assateague coast guard, this is assateague coast guard 1. The Beebe boy is ok. Pick us up. Out. Got your grandma so sick with worry, she almost had to take to her bed. I'm so upset all I thinking of is whaling the tar out of you. How do you think we felt seeing our boat towed back? I'm sorry, grandpa. I didn't mean to lose the boat. We were scared you were drowned. Why did you do it, Paul? Answer your grandma. Why did you go off to assateague alone? I don't know. I knew it was wrong,but... I'll promise you something. You ever do a trick like that again, you'll eat off the mantle for a week. Go change your clothes and meet me in the barn. We'll hay the horses. We're all late with our chores today, thanks to you. I'm sorry, grandpa. I'm real sorry, grandma. Some is, some ain't... Akin with the wild things. Used to be myself. I used to hear the call of assateague... When I was a young one. Now I don't hear it. I don't see the beauty no more. Now when I go over there, all I do is cuss the flies and mosquitoes. You sure gave everybody a scare. Did you see the phantom again? Did you get close to her? She's so different from all the other horses. It's like she knows she's something special or something. What do you mean? Well, she's part of the herd, and she belongs to the pied Piper, but yet she doesn't. We just got to have her, Maureen. You've sure got a nerve. Why didn't you take me with you? Well... I'm sorry. Come on, girl. See her, Mike? See her? You be a good girl at your new home. You won't have any trouble with her, sir. She's real gentle. Let's go, dear. Thanks a lot, Mr. Beebe. Well, that's the last of the foals. Thanks, grandpa. You earned it. What if he says we can't have the phantom? What? Well, she's a 3-year-old. Grandpa said only the young ones could be tamed. She can be tamed. Paul, what if he says no? She can be tamed. We won't ever sell her. Not for anything. But before we can buy her, we got to earn another $40. We will. I know we will. Old Mr. Platt will pay us a good price for these. I can't stand them. Eew! Don't, Paul! Ow! There must be another way to earn the money we need. Mr. Burton? Need any extra helpers here? We need the work, Mr. Burton. What's the matter? Did grandpa Beebe fire you off the farm? No, sir. We have to earn some money. We sure do need it. We'll do anything. I can't give you any work counting clams, but I'll buy all you can dig. Thanks, Mr. Burton. Thanks for me, too. Gee, thanks, Mr. Burton. We really appreciate it. How is your grandfolks? Fine, thank you. Selling many ponies these days? Well, no, sir. Last Colt was sold quite a while ago. Nothing since then. Would you buy more clams from us if we catch them? Yup, yup. I will. Bye, Mr. Burton. Bye. We're still $6.00 short. It's only a week until pony-penning day. I noticed weeds in Mrs. Chester's garden. Maybe she'll hire me to hoe them. After our chores tomorrow, I'll go into town. Somebody must need something done. Morning, Mr. Hancock. How are you today, Paul? Fine, thank you, sir. Need any help around here, Mr. Hancock? Know how to carve a decoy? No, sir, but I can help hammer some lobster traps together. Don't need any. Got more than I can sell now. How about me sweeping up the place? I'll do a good job. Make everything real neat and clean for only $1.00. 50 cents? A quarter? I just got to earn the money, Mr. Hancock. We need it real bad. Is things that tough, huh? Yes, sir. All right. 50 cents. $102. And 40 cents. We made it. When can we bring her home? The roundup's on Wednesday, and the sales's on Thursday, so Thursday, I guess. Paul, won't it be wonderful? We'll own the phantom. When grandpa gets home from town, we'll talk about renting an empty stall. Phantom has got to have a real nice stall to live in. How much is the rent? I don't know. I can do extra work for grandpa to pay for it. Phantom's worth it. Well, I guess that's about it, Charlie. Corn, oats. How much do I owe you? Why don't I figure it out later? You can pay when you come in for feed. Figure it out now, and I'll pay you now. There's no hurry about it, Clarence. I trust you. I never gave you any reason not to. Come on. How much do I owe you? Clarence, we've been friends for a long time. You don't have to beat around the bush with me. I'm willing to give you credit. I don't remember asking for it. What bush are you beating around? What's the matter? I'm doing you a favor, and you're losing your temper. I'm not losing my temper! I'm just trying to figure out what's going on. Jenkins at the harness shop gave me the runaround. What's happening? Doesn't anyone do cash business anymore? We heard you were in a little trouble. We were only trying to help. Trouble? Trouble? What kind of trouble? Shucks, Clarence. Any man can run short from time to time. Ain't nothing to be ashamed about. Now, who told you that? Oh, quite a few folks. You mean everything's all right with you? It was until I heard this. Who's spreading this kind of talk about me? Why, the way your grandchildren been pestering everybody for jobs, saying how bad they needed money, well, we got the idea that you folks was hard up. How much do I owe you? $18 even. Hard up. That Minnie Gellison? Yeah. She insisted I take these things for Maureen. Said her daughter had outgrown them. What else did she say? She didn't come right out with it, but she thinks we can't afford to buy clothes for Maureen and Paul. Clarence... You keeping something from me? Are we in any kind of trouble? Them two young'uns are. What did they do? That's what I aim to find out. Maureen! Paul! We'll ask grandpa about renting the stall for phantom now. Sit down. Now, what exactly have you two been up to? Cleaning out the small corral. I don't mean that. Since school's been out, what have you been doing in town? We've been working when our chores are done. We've done all sorts of work. What did you tell the folks that you pestered for these jobs? We didn't pester anybody. What did you tell them? We only told them we wanted work. 'Cause we had to earn some money. You said you had to earn some money? We told everybody we needed it real bad. Oh. And did you tell them you needed it real bad because I was broke? No, grandpa. You got everybody thinking I can't even pay my bills. You got them thinking I can't even put clothes on your back. Why did you do it? Well, we needed the money. For what? Are you trying to be the richest kids in Virginia? You got $60 from me for gentling the foals. But, grandpa, that wasn't enough. Enough for what? Enough to buy the phantom with. The phantom? You said the fire department charges $100.00 for a pony, so we just had to earn the rest. We earned $102.40. You don't need to buy any pony. The corral is full of them. Go out and ride anytime you want. But we want to own one, grandpa. We want one that doesn't have to be sold. Well, then pick one out, and you can have it for keeps. It's the phantom we want, grandpa. We wanted her the first time we saw her. Wanting her and getting her is two different things. She's given the horse laugh to the best roundup men for two years. What makes you think she can be caught? I'll be riding with you this time, grandpa. Paul, listen to me. The phantom's not a horse. The phantom's a piece of wind and sky. That's why we call her the phantom. Grandpa, that's why we want her so much... because she's different. If you'll rent us one of your empty stalls, I'll do extra work to pay for it. Knowing what you want and going after it is a virtue. They have more than their share. I'll tell you something. If the phantom's caught the day after tomorrow, you can buy her, and I'll give you a stall and feed and everything for nothing. They think I'm poor. I'm the richest man on this whole island. That's the black comet. Sure is frisky, isn't he? He's owned by his rider. Young Albert Lee brings him down every year to get a feel for the track before the race. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! He's fast, really fast. Sure is. He's won the pony-penning day race for the last two years in a row. We never seem to give him competition in chincoteague. Hi, Tom. Hi, Paul. Have a good time at the roundup. Yes, sir. I've gathered corn, carrots, rutabagas, and a jar of molasses to whet her appetite when she gets here. Be sure and lay a clean bed of straw for the phantom. I will, before grandma and I go to town. You ride watcheye. Can he outrun the phantom? Not likely, but you keep your mind on the roundup. Follow the orders of the roundup man. All right. Let's go. Morning, Wylie. Morning, boys. Let's go aboard. All right. Come on, Paul. Cast off, boys. We're ready to cast off. Go ahead, Paul. All right. Let's go. Get going. All right. Let's go, boys. Come on, Paul. Come on. Bring them up here. Bring them up. Line up here, Paul. Line right up here at the side. All right, now pay attention to Mr. Mattox. Miles, you and Jeff ride south. Lloyd, you and ward ride north. Clarence and the grandson go east. The rest of us go towards the woods. Bring all ponies to the old pen. What time is low water? About 10:00. Get them to the old pen about 9:30. We'll rest them before swimming them across the channel. Let's go. All right, Paul. Look. Pied Piper's bunch. Hey! Hey! Straggler run that way. Get him! Gee, I didn't know you had a baby. Think he's lost? I don't rightly know. Hey, look! Phantom. Boy, that's something to be proud of... bringing in the phantom. I don't know. I think she sort of brought me in. The pied Piper's bugle can be heard a long way. She wants to be with him especially now that she has a foal. Tide's out. The current's slack. Time to swim them across the channel. Let's get them started. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Grandpa, she's drowning. He's in the water. Come on, Paul. Come on. Come on, Paul. Come on. I swum the whole way with you, son. You're the most wonderful and craziest young'un in the whole world. Can I get through? Excuse me. Paul, are you all right? Paul, you were wonderful. Is that phantom's Colt? It sure is. That's misty. How come she has a name already? Well, I just called her that on account of that's what she looked like when I first saw her. All misty. Could have talked it over with me before you named her. It is sort of a nice name though. Misty. I like it. Don't be dropping none of those popped corns. Hey, let's go see misty again. Don't be gone long. The race will be starting soon. You want a hot dog? Yeah. All right. Hi, young'un. Hi, Mr. Apscott. How about buying the last two chances on a sorrel pony? No, thanks. Only $1.00. How about $100 pony for $1.00? Isn't she beautiful? How are we going to get the phantom and misty for $102.40? Well, how can we buy both of them tomorrow? Well, I've been thinking about it, and we'll have to be here at sunup to catch the fire chief early. Then I'll say to him, "Mr. Jones, sir, we want to buy the phantom and her filly misty." But we've only got $102.40. "We've earned $102 in less than 4 months, and we..." don't forget the 40 cents. "We can earn another $100 in 4 more months, "so the fire department will get all their money for misty." That's what I'll say to him. Maybe I'll say it to him today... If I see him. Well, can you think of anything better? She sure picked an awful time to have misty. Let's go find Mr. Jones now. Think Lucy Lee's got a chance? How about peaches? Can she beat black comet? Well, they'll make a race of it. I'll be seeing you. Hello, Paul. Maureen. Hello, Mr. Jones. You having a good time? We know the pony sale isn't until tomorrow. I got to get over there. I'll see you later. Mr. Jones, Paul and I want to buy the phantom! Let's go see the race. The race is 1/2 mile. Riding black comet is his owner, 12-year-old Allen Lee. Riding patches is 11-year-old Denny Colton. Upon Lucy Lee is 12-year-old Benson Hamlin. And they're off! Come on, Denny! Go! Go! Come on, Denny! Come on! Come on, patches! Next year the phantom's going to be in this race. Next year she's going to win. You'll see. Come on. Let's go find Mr. Jones. Paul, look. Well, we'll just have to get here early in the morning and talk to Mr. Jones then. Gee, I can hardly wait. First we'll have to find Mr. Jones and settle it with him. Grandpa said he'd be around the Colt pen. There he is. Come on. Misty's wearing a sold tag. Does that mean the phantom's been sold, too? Misty's wearing a sold rope. Who? Misty's phantom's Colt, sir. We've been saving to buy the phantom. We want both of them. We earned $102.40 in 4 months. We could earn $100 more if you'd trust us. We'll hunt clams and crabs if you'll let us. I know we can earn the money. We didn't know the phantom would have a foal. Why didn't you tell me? We tried to yesterday. Sorry, I didn't know you wanted them. Come on over here and sit down. Last night, this man by the name of Mr. Foster looked me up. He's got business and couldn't be here for the sale. He and his boy took a fancy to that foal. He bought misty last night? Well, he put $50 down. I told him the foal was too young to be separated from his mother. He's taking the phantom, too? Picking them both up when he drives back through here on Saturday. If you'd only told me before. It wouldn't be right if I went back on that deal I made with Mr. Foster. I'm sorry, Paul. Maureen. Real sorry. Gramps! What's the matter with you two? They...they sold the phantom and misty last night. That old man's going to take them away Saturday. Want to see something? How do you like that for a horse family? They're the best yearlings of the whole lot, and the prettiest, too, if you ask me. A long time ago, when I was about your age, I had my heart set on a spaniel pup. Before I’d saved the money to get him, the man sold him to somebody else. I felt so bad, I thought I'd never get over it, but you know something? My daddy bought me another dog, and before I knowed it, I couldn't remember what that spaniel looked like. You want to stay and watch them drive the ponies back through town for their swim back to assateague? It's the same as before, isn't it? Yep, but they go in the other direction. We got chores to do at home, grandpa. Ladies and gentlemen, all the foals and yearlings have been sold. We are now ready to swim the mares and stallions back to assateague. Hyah! Hyah! Tomorrow's Saturday. I don't need you to remind me. If only I hadn't gone on that darn roundup. I should have gone right up to Mr. Jones, race or no race. We both should have. We should have told him then. What'll we do with the money? Maybe we can buy an electric toaster for grandma and grandpa and save the rest to go to college on the mainland when we get older. All right. Shall we do it tomorrow? Might as well. Paul? Maureen, I don't want to talk any more about it. Paul! Maureen! Will y'all come here a minute? Come over here a minute. Mr. Foster has a problem here, and I thought you might be able to help him out. The other day, Mr. Foster and his son bought them a mare and a foal. A mare and a foal? On the way out, they took a chance on that sorrel pony in the raffle. They won the raffle, and now Tommy says he likes the sorrel pony better than he does the foal. Better than misty? Yep. Now, this presents a real problem to Mr. Foster. He don't want to go back on his word, 'cause he already put up the money, and we were wondering if you knew someone who could take them off his hands for, uh, maybe $100? For both? Yep. I'll take $100 for the lot. Mr. Foster, you got yourself a deal. It makes me sad, the way she keeps looking off at assateague. She's just not used to civilization yet. Will she ever be? Of course. She just needs time, that's all. You like? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. She's learning. Mm-hmm. Easy now, girl. We'll be finished soon. Just keep going. She even lets me brush her now. Oh, any critter would learn to like that. You got her, but you ain't gentled her yet, not by a long shot. That settles it. I'm getting a bronc buster to break that phantom. No, grandpa. I told you in the beginning only yearlings like misty are worth fooling with. But she didn't hurt me, grandpa. I just fell down, honest. She'll get used to a lead rope. I'm willing to pay for the bronc buster. But you said it was wrong to break a pony. Yeah, you said breaking a pony was the fast way and gentling was the sure way. We want to gentle her, not break her. Ohh! Stop pestering me. I'll keep the phantom busy with an apple while you place this girth around her. Grandpa says she won't mind it after she gets used to it. You can't come this time, misty. You can't come. Stay there, misty. Why are you so surprised at his gentling the phantom? You're the one who said it. Said what? That he was kin with the wild things. Grandpa? Huh? We just can't get the phantom to take a bit in her mouth. Well, uh... Ain't she traveling right? Yeah, we lean the way we want her to go and lay the rope against her neck. Well, what more do you want? It's ok? Of course. The phantom will probably be happier never knowing a metal bit. Why ask a question like that? Well... We were worried that you'd be ashamed of us if we didn't do the right job on our own pony. Ashamed? Why, I'm so proud, I'm almost busting. Name me two other kids that ever gentled a 3-year-old wild pony? Misty sure is happy here. Yeah, but I wonder if the phantom is happy, too. Did you see her when I rode down to the point today? Her hoofs were hardly touching the ground. I know she's happy when she runs, but... then we'll have to run her all the time. She's not very happy here. It's cold out there. Grandpa, there's an old kerosene heater in the barn. May we have it to put in the phantom's stall? What for? To keep her and misty warm. They must be freezing out there. Compared to the winters she's spent on assateague without so much as a roof over her head, this is a regular vacation. Yeah, but what about misty? This is her first winter. Her ma will take care of her. She won't suffer none. They're all right, don't worry. But you're going to catch your death if you keep walking around in bare feet. Up with you. Merry Christmas. And a happy new year. They just love popcorn. Me, too. A sure sign of spring. Mm-hmm. Friendly or not friendly, I will not have you in my kitchen. You get out of here and stay out. Will one of you please teach this pesky creature she's a filly and not a human? Honestly! Hi, Paul. Hi, Denny. How's patches? Fine. How's the phantom? Fine. I heard she runs pretty good. Are you going to enter her in the race next pony-penning day? We haven't been invited to yet, but I'm hoping to be. Patches nearly beat the black comet last year. Race you to those clump of trees. Ok, then. Let's go. All right. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Boy, I'll say she can ride! She might even be able to beat the black comet. I think she can. Just because the phantom beat patches in the Meadow don't mean anything. It means she's faster than the pony that come closest to beating the black comet last year. Can't you hold still? The boy said the phantom didn't just beat patches, she beat the britches off him. I wouldn't bet on her. Who's asking you to? However fast her speed, the black comet's got the experience. Since when don't it matter how much speed a pony's got in a race? Jeb, I think you nicked me. The way you're jerking, you're lucky I didn't cut you to the bone. You entered the phantom in the race this year, Clarence? It's not for me to say. That pony belongs to my grandchildren. All right, Jeb. Get on with it. Oh, watch how he's plum tuckered out. I think he's mad about the phantom beating him so many times. Bet I could beat patches even worse than you did. What makes you think that? Because I weigh less and the phantom runs even faster with me riding her. Paul! Maureen! Come here. You have a visitor. Hello, Paul. Maureen. Mr. Jones. Hello, Mr. Jones. I hear you own a pony that might bring the racing championship back to chincoteague. The volunteer fire department would be honored if you'd enter the phantom next pony-penning day. Will you do it? We... yes, sir... we were hoping you'd ask. It's settled. It'll be the phantom against the black comet. It hasn't been decided yet about the other chincoteague pony. It might be patches or Wyle Mattox' firefly. Are there any rules about who can ride? Only that an owner or owner's child must ride. We don't allow professional jockeys. Nobody over 16 years old. Are girls allowed? We never had a girl rider before, but there's no rule against it. You eat every bite of that now. I want you in good condition for the race. After school, I'll take you running on the beach. I'll ride her after school today. It's my turn. It's not just riding her. You got to put her in special condition. I know as much about it as you. 3 miles. Start at a slow jog, trot her, then ask for a burst of speed. And slow jog her all the way home. Grandpa told me about it, too. It's the pied Piper again. I'd know his call anywhere. Clarence? Huh? What's wrong between Paul and Maureen? I know something's going on. He comes in, she goes out. She goes in, he comes out. They just rode off together on the phantom and still acted like they were on separate ponies. We got to settle it sometime, so let's settle it now. It's settled to me. Girls just don't ride in races! Chief Jones says there's no rule against it. I don't care! It's not right! It's not fitting! I ride as good as you. That doesn't matter. Phantom's as much mine as yours. All right then, we'll flip for it. Two out of three times. I don't care if it's five out of five. Listen here, Paul Beebe, you rode in the roundup 'cause girls aren't allowed, so I get to ride in the race. It's only fair. I guess that's right. Ok. You really mean it? You really and truly mean I can? If you want it that way. Don't worry. The phantom and I will win. I know. I promise. Don't do that. Hey, isn't that the black comet? Hi. Hello. That's the black comet, isn't it? Fast as a comet, too. We saw her win the race last year. She sure is fast. My name's Paul Beebe. This is my sister Maureen. This is the phantom and misty, her Colt. That's the phantom? Yeah, and she's faster than your old horse. Yeah? Yeah. How'd you like to prove it? Just wait till the race. You'll find out. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll race you right now. Go ahead and get on. You do it. You call it. If you think your nag can last that long, we'll race to that sand dune and back to here. You can even let your sister say go. On your Mark... Get set... Go! Come on, Paul! Come on, Paul! You beat him! You beat the black comet! Come on. Let's get home and tell grandpa. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. Which one of you think the black comet is going to win the next race? You're wasting your time. Everybody's betting on the phantom now. Only money on the comet is over on the mainland. Come on, Clarence. I got to get some bets down. I know. We have to get started if you're going to drive all the way to the mainland. Yes, sir, ladies and gentlemen, step up and see the little mare who's going to bring the championship back to chincoteague. Hard to believe, isn't it? Hard to believe? They're beebes, aren't they? Stop it! Stop it! Oh, hold on there, Maureen. Can't you see what she's doing? She's kicking her. She's kicking her foal. I know it looks like that mare's kicking her baby away, like she doesn't love her anymore. It's not like that at all. She's proving her love, showing it the hardest way you can, by letting go. Sure, she'd like to have her foal depend on her always, but she knows that that time is over, that the time for letting go has come. Come on. Let's go in. Come on. Grandpa says there's never been so much betting as there is this year. The race isn't for two months yet. This will be the first time in three years since chincoteague ever had a winning pony. How much does a winner get? Hmm? How much does a winner get? $12, I guess. Gee... I wish I could make the phantom feel happier. She was happy when she beat the black comet. Yeah, but she can't race all the time. She didn't finish all her oats last night. It's the pied Piper. We got to let her go back, Maureen. Let her go back to assateague where she belongs. All right. Go. Go on back! Go on! Go home! You hear me? Go back where you belong! Yes, it's him. The pied Piper's waiting for you! Now go on! You, too, misty. Go on back with her. You belong there... Both of you. I'm sorry about all the people who made bets on her. They won't lose anything. We had to do it, Maureen. I couldn't stand seeing the phantom so unhappy. Grandpa will understand. Guess she was just a phantom after all. Never stopped belonging to assateague and the pied Piper.
