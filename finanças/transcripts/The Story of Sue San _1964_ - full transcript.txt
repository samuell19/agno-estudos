I spent 9 years in a brothel I have been tortured in order to keep my chastity. We hardly know each other I'm afraid our marriage doesn't hold. You're worried about this? Don't cry and don't be sad. We'll reaffirm our marriage vows. We bow to Heaven as our witness. We bow to Earth as our proof. We bow to our ancestors to affirm our status. You're my wife. We'll grow old together. We'll grow old together. Go away! Everything is here, master! Please check the accounts! This is for... Shop owner, take over for me! Yes! Anything else, sir? Nothing! Then I'm leaving! You have money? Yes! Master Wang, please go upstairs for dim sum! Very well... You may go! Yes! Young Master! Take care of yourself! I will. Eat something before you leave! What are you looking at? Move! Go. What are you doing? You gave me a scare! Wining and dining day and night. Without a care in the world. Giving out embroidered fabric pearls and jade. Spending like there's no tomorrow.

Did someone bully you? What's the matter? I can't stay here anymore! Let's move! She's right! You're the son of a former minister. You can't stay here forever I'll have the shop owner help you find another place. Master Liu. We have an empty lot in the back. Build a mansion there we can look out for each other. You can live there and enjoy your privacy. Very well! Don't! That's too extravagant! It's alright... I'll have to trouble you on this matter. Of course... Look at this, Master! We'll build 2 wings. Flowers grown along the pavilion. Footpath laden with cobblestones. Bamboo along the lotus pond. Picturesque scenery. The dissolute gentleman has no worries. The couple is happy as can be. We'll drink to the spring flowers in bloom. We'll listen to music in the summer wind. We'll enjoy the autumn moon. We'll chat around the fire in winter. We'll travel around and enjoy the landscape. We'll be true to each other forever. We'll live happily ever after. We'll live happily ever after. Live happily ever after. Check! What a move! Sir! Miss! Have a seat! Yes! About the cost for the mansion and miscellaneous expenses. Later... We have to pay these right away! Deduct it from my account! Yes, but... There's no more money in your account! All 30,000 taels are gone? Yes, we have already advanced 1,000 taels! Please take a look! What's this coffin for? You're forgetful, sir! You promised to buy that for her mother! What about the nunnery? That's your donation. We'll do this later! Yes! Miss Su, you must tell him some of these must be settled soon plus the money we have advanced. Alright... If we go on like this. Let alone 30,000 taels. Even 300,000 taels is not enough! If you don't mind me... Don't say things like that... Listen, if you don't mind me. You should buy me off from my mother I can go anywhere with you once I'm free. This place is a black hole I'll speak to her. I already told you. This is no way to spend your money. I have an idea. If you want to buy her freedom it'll only cost you 3,000 taels! Fine! Please send this letter home for me. Once I get the money, I'll pay you! But that won't help your situation now. We have advanced money to you you must do something. Alright! We're very tight we cannot live like we used to. We must use sparingly! Dinner is ready! Let's eat! Yes! What is this? Mother said things are tight we must cut down on expenses! This is ridiculous! Don't argue with her! This is insulting! I must speak with her! Alright... Buy some stewed meat and wine I'll pay you later. Don't get upset over this. She knows nothing but money. Once we get the money we'll leave here at once! From here to my hometown it'll take at least 2 months! How can we stand this? I'll think of a way. Don't worry! Time goes fast! What should we do? Think for us. Where do you think our money come from? From the customers! You have customers waiting yet you choose this poor fellow for how long? I'm married to him. How can I entertain customers? Don't mention his name! He's taken you and eating off of us! Be fair. He has spent a lot of money here! How can you say that about him? That's not true! He spent his money willingly. No one took advantage of him! Go tell him he must pay to live here! We're running a business, not a charity. Don't go too far! Master Wang has already sent for money. Once he gets it, he'll pay you! Miss. That was over a month ago! How much longer must we wait? Shen Yan Lin is coming tomorrow. You better go entertain him I won't do it! Don't be unreasonable. It's useless talking to you! You bitch! I'll show you! Fine! Show me! That's enough! What? What's going on? What's wrong with her? Nothing! They had an argument! About what? Don't play dumb! You have no worry. You have a place to sleep and a wife. Fine... What about us? What do you mean? Like what I said. We're running a business here. Alright! I'll pay you... How? Fine! Later! You must think of a way. Brothels don't take credit! This is ridiculous! No use talking to him. Don't get all riled up. You're here! How are you? Fine... is the young master home? Inside... Yes! Your sister gave specific instructions you must go home at once. Where's the money? She gave me 50 taels of silver for your traveling expenses. That's not enough! I need money to buy Su San's freedom. You better go home with him I'll wait for you. No way! She's right! Shut up! Don't worry! I won't leave until I set you free! Master... Go back, I know what I'm doing. It's actually a small sum but your father has written me. He specifically told me not to lend you money I think you better go home. But I made a promise! I must pay her ransom. You have fun at a brothel but you shouldn't take it too seriously. Uncle I'm sorry I can't help you! What's going on? What are you doing? Don't you recognize me? I'm Master Wang. We have instructions not to let you in. Go away! Playing rough? Get lost! Customer! Master Shen is here! You haven't been here for a while! I've been away! I heard Wang is gone. Yes! How is Su San? Still a bit upset! Master Shen! How are you? Fine, thank you. Su San is sick, go look in on her! Yes! This way! Please! This way. Did Wang build this garden? Yes! He's a fool to squander his money like this! You're eating the rice he cooked. But he had the first bite! This way... Not bad! Please have a seat I'll go fetch her. Sit. Su San. You have a visitor. Who is it? Go see for yourself! Is it Master Wang? Take a look. How are you? Sorry, Master Shen! I cannot entertain you! What's with you? Master Shen came to visit you how can you say this? I told you I'm not entertaining anymore. You're rebellious I'll show you who's in charge! I know I've known that since I was 8. You bitch! She's upset, I'll come again. Master Shen, please forgive her! Don't worry! I'll fix this right away or else I'll go out of business! What's with you? What's your hurry? What are you doing here? I'm delivering melon seeds. Don't rile her up, she's already upset! My apologies, Master Shen! Miss Su! Leave me alone! It's me! Who is it? Jin. They're forcing you to entertain? I saw Master Wang. He's still here? Yes! It's so worrisome! Where is he? "Kwun's Temple." Over there! Hurry! I'll stand guard outside! Sir... Sir I've been wronged. Relaying the story in front of Guan Wang. Since I met Master Wang. We've been in love. He's broke and roams the streets I can barely sleep and eat I feel like I've been stabbed in the heart. Please have mercy. Let me see him again I'll even die... Master Wang! Su San. You have suffered. Don't... Look at me! Who do you take me for? What's with you? It's dawn already! Miss Su. Miss Su. It's dawn already! You must go! I must go now! Su San... Hurry! Buy some clothes with this and go home! I can't take your money I'm yours, let alone my money! You must hurry back! Our business is not that good. It's the end of the year, we have no customers! What's with you? Shen Yan Lin was here today. He's still after Su San. We'll make her entertain him while she's still worth something. Alright! Let's do it! We'll ask Shen Yan Lin to wait. She'll never agree. We'll use force! I don't think so. She's our cash-cow. We'll have to milk her. Go home if you're not feeling well. Take Zhang's carriage. Be careful! Yes! Stop... Stop... Stop... Sit down! Sit down! Where are we? This won't do... Master Shen... Where are we going? I'm taking you home I've already redeemed you. Redeemed? How come I don't know of it? I paid 1,000 taels for you I'm taking you home to Shanxi with me! Master Shen, you know I'm married to Wang Jin Long. He's been gone for 6 months without a word! He has forgotten about you! He wouldn't! Please take me back! I just got you out of a living hell I can't send you back! Besides, I paid 1,000 taels for you! Get in! Get in! Come on! I'll go back if you won't take me! Let go! Look at you! Come on, get up! Master Shen I belong to Master Wang I won't go with you. Don't be silly! Wang Jin Long doesn't want you! If he wants me, I'll go with him. If not, I'll go back to Fu Chun Yuan. Even if you go back there they won't take you in. Let's go! Let go of me! How dare you resist? Don't push me! I'll kill myself! Don't be silly! Wake up! Su San! Su San... wake up! Wake up! "Model of Morale." What's the matter? I thought I saw the young master. Where? Over there! You're seeing things because you miss him! No! Stop this nonsense! Let's go in! Young Master! You're back! Wang Ding! Brother... Sisters... Let's go inside! Yes! Where have you been? Why didn't you write us? You may go! Let's go see father! He can't go in yet! The old master said... He has disowned you. He'll beat you! How about this... wait in your room first. Master, the young mistresses are here! Father! Sit down! How are you? Getting weaker I think it won't be long now. Don't say these things! It's not a taboo I'm indifferent to death. Father... I summon you here to tell you I've split my fortune in half. Here's the account. You need not fight over it when I'm gone. Everything is listed here. There's no rush for this. Besides, you should split it 3 ways. Yes, what about Jin Long? Who? Our brother Jin Long. Yes, what about him... I've already disowned him. I have no heir! Even though he has been so senseless. He'll regret if eventually. He'll come home sooner or later. If he sets foot in this house I'll banish him just the same. Nothing is better than a prodigal son who returns. He'll learn from his mistakes. If he comes back he'll turn over a new leaf. He won't come back! Father! I'm back! Jin Long... You fool! Father! Father... I'm sorry, father! Banish this fool! Please calm down! Please sit! Father! Wang Ding, fetch me the stick. Yes, sir! Why are you still standing there? Yes, but... The young master is weak... Nonsense! Father, please calm down! Father! Don't defend him I must teach him a lesson today! Father! Father... Take care of yourself, father! Anger is most harmful! He is indeed unworthy; But considering the fact that... mother was sick before he was born and died in childbirth. On her death bed she pitied him. If you beat him mother will be displeased. Father! For mother's sake beat us instead. Such retribution! "Hong Dong County." Sir. Take the luggage inside. Yes... You're back, Sir! She's not feeling well, help her inside! Madam... Wake up, Master Zhao! I'm telling you... What is it? Stop fooling around! The old master is back! What? The old fool is here! Where? Outside! Master. Where is Madam? In her room. Move those cases here! I'm back! Coming! Take things as they come. Compared to Fu Chun Yuan this is at least a change of pace! Take a rest! I'm telling you if you touch me again I'll kill myself! Don't lose your temper! You'll meet Madam Pi soon you'll have to... What? Say hello to her! Go on! Say hello! Were you sleeping? What is this? Su San is my concubine. Say hello to madam. Go on! I've been with you all my life have I done you wrong? No! What is this then? She's here to serve you! I don't have such luck! Don't be like this! I'll make her move if you wish. That's too easy for you! You think, without me you can do as you please out there? Listen... Come out! He brought someone home? What do you have in mind? I'll put her in the storeroom for now I'm heartbroken. The night is cold and long. The night is over but not my sorrow. The oil is gone but not my tears. I grin and bear all sufferings. Brace myself for the torture. Don't know when it will end. Worried about never seeing him again. Your ginseng tea, Master! Bring it to the young master! Yes! Ginseng tea, sir! Congratulations! Your son Wang Jin Long came in first in the imperial examination. He's personally named by the Emperor! Congratulations! Good... Who is it? Chun Jin, it's me! You gave me a scare! Who was it? Su San. She scared me to death lurking around! Su San. Open up! I must speak with you! Wait till tomorrow! Su San. I know you don't want to stay here I'll take you away tomorrow. Give me some rat poison! Yes! Bring this to her! I'm scared, madam! Go on! Madam... Go! I'm telling you. We're in this together. You won't get away! She saw us the other night. If she tells the old fool... think about his. We'll be in trouble if word gets out! If she eats this... that's even bigger trouble! Just go, you little bitch! Listen, if we don't kill her we can't rest. Besides, when the old fool dies we'll split his fortune. With her around, there'll be trouble. But... Just go! Madam... Go! Coming! What is it? Fix me something, I'm hungry! Alright! You're not feeling well. Madam sends you some noodles! Thank you, but I have no appetite! You must eat if you're ill! Eat it while it's hot! Master! Is she ill? Are you alright? I'll send for a doctor. No! That's not necessary! Why aren't you eating? No appetite! Don't let it get cold! Leave it if you can't eat! I'll eat it! What's the matter? Help! What is it? It's Master Shen... Your heartless bitch! You murdered him! No, I didn't... You won't get away! Fetch the magistrate! "Justice." Madam Pi, how dare you! You sent the poisoned noodles and you accused Su San! Tell me the truth! Magistrate. Don't listen to Su San. She hates my husband so she commits this heinous crime! Please redress the injustice! I've been wrongly accused! Take them in custody. We'll investigate! Court is adjourned! Sir, I've been wronged! Please listen... I'm the plaintiff. I have a wonderful book. Please pass it on to the Magistrate. Indeed, this is wonderful. Rewards make me uneasy. What can I do for you? Madam Pi is innocent in the Shen murder. Please do your best to help the Magistrate come to a verdict! Please... Will you confess, Su San? I have nothing to confess. Torture her! She passed out! Wake her up! Yes! Confess, Su San! Let me speak! Go ahead! A few nights ago I saw Madam Pi and Chun Jin conspiring with scholar Zhao! You should confess to murdering Shen Yan Lin not accusing others! Guards! Yes! Pinching torture! Yes! Let me speak! Will you confess! I've been framed! Torture her! Yes! I'll confess, sir! Let her go! Make her sign! Yes! Sign! It's her! Shameless! Silence... Greetings, Magistrate!

Adjourned! By virtue of the Emperor's edict. Wang Jin Long is on an imperial inspection. He'll be awarded the Imperial Sword. That'll be all! Long live His Majesty! It's late, you should get some rest! "Death by dismemberment." Young master... Inspector... Magistrates from the Civil Services are here. Send them in! Yes! This way! Greetings, Inspector! Greetings! Please sit down! I've just arrived I need your advice. Don't mention it! If you need anything I'll be happy to oblige! How's the local condition? People are simple and honest, they live in peace! The administration needs improvement. Any reforms rely heavily on you, sir! You flatter me! I've been presented with these cases have you read them? Roughly... Yes! This murder case in Hong Dong county is there an inside story? It's concluded! There's a petition from the accused have you read it? It's a matter of formality! In that case I'd like to re-open the case to gain experience. Please sit in on this with me. Call the court to order tomorrow! This is a minor case we can do this later! We should always start from something small. Indeed, you are most wise! "Inspection Ministry." "Justice." Bring in the accused! Silence! Su San is here! Remove the shackle! Greetings! Lift your head! San... Su San, regarding the case what do you have to say for yourself? I have a petition I've seen it. Let me speak! Go ahead! I was orphaned and sold to a brothel at 7 I've suffered. Met a patron named Wang. He was... Go on! His father was a former Civil Office Minister. Before me and the Imperial Inspector you're free to speak. Don't hesitate! I... Nothing! Go on! He paid 3,000 taels for my first night. We were sent into the room I truly loved Master Wang and was sad inside the wedding chamber. Buying my first night is not a proper marriage. A fling will not last long. Master Wang read my mind. We bowed to Heaven and Earth again and renewed our vows. We were like real husband and wife. This guy is a romantic. Senseless fool! I was referring to Master Wang. He lived at the brothel for 3 years built a mansion and bought all sorts of gifts. Wining and dinning day and night. He would not listen to me. He squandered 36,000 taels. The bawd turned hostile and he finally knew about snobbery. He put aside his pride and tried to borrow money his fair weather friends turned a deaf ear.
