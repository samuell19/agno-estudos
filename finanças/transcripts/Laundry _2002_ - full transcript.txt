My name is Teru It's actually Teruo, but everyone calls me Teru I work at a coin laundry I make sure no one steals any laundry Grandma owns the place But recently she's been worrying... about bad people stealing women's underwear So she gave me this job I have a scar on my head When I was a kid, I fell in a manhole People say I have a scar on my brain, too I'm opening shop again today It's my first task everyday I always forget where I put my keys Grandma says I should hang it on a string from my neck But I won't do it Only kids hang keys from their necks " Coin Laundry " Good My eyes are always peeled I'm a patrol officer protecting the city Big gas tanks... I get a bit scared seeing gas tanks They get bigger little by little, everyday They'll swell up like big balloons, and explode one day Everyone will be blown to bits and die Hello God, my chest hurts Must've been last night's dinner... This old man comes everyday He comes to wash just one tank top and a pair of underwear He lives with his son and daughter-in-law but she won't wash them for him because they're filthy People like that... deserve to get sucked up by a vacuum cleaner Thing about tulips is... the petals start to sag like this during the day... This lady loves photography Every time she comes, she brings photos she took recently She took those, too I said nice things about them, and she brought them back framed So I stopped saying nice things about them Can't have her putting up any more pictures And I feel like an insect looking at so many flowers This guy's a boxer. He has a match today Hello Hey man! Keepin' a close watch? Yeah Check it out! He's stealing something Just kidding, man Scared me I did everything I could... I can win this time I'm feeling so good, I'm surprising myself, even All right I think he'll win, too I mean, he's already lost 18 times And this lady... I've never seen before You forgot this Oh... Say... Wanna come in for tea? What do you do there? At the coin laundry? Right I make sure no one steals any laundry Lots of underwear thieves around I see Stealing is a bad thing You're right How old are you? Don't look it Figured you were younger I'm 20 Cute hat Grandma made it I'd get spasms if I went outside without a hat Are you sick? Not sick Just a scar on my head from falling in a manhole You fell in a manhole? Grandma said so. I don't really remember it I see... So you live with your grandma Just me and grandma Alone? Me? Yup, always alone. It's a relief ... most of the time Sorry, this is all I have Here I need to go. I have work What's the hurry? I'll pour some more tea But I have work I'm going now Please Just stay 5 minutes? OK Thanks For 5 minutes, she didn't say a word My heart was beating a bit faster It was my first time touching a woman's hand... other than grandma's That night, I casually told grandma about what happened Very casually Grandma called her a minx I'm a loser! I'm a goddamn loser! What on earth are you doing? Come out man, c'mon What's his problem? Open up, man What the...? Hey, open up, come out...! Sorry, excuse me, do you mind getting out of the way for a sec? Hey, let's go already C'mon Fine, fine Hey Was that an ambulance? Wonder if someone got sick? Or maybe a suicide? I rode one yesterday Really? Pathetic, huh? Knocked out in 2 rounds... But you know, I was so close In the first half, I was the aggressor Couldn't believe how many punches I landed I just kept backing him into the corner He was totally on the defensive Must've landed at least 15 in a row 15, for sure That wasn't my best shot, though It's the left uppercut, man I nail the body, then the guard comes down So from this angle here, about 45 degrees, from the hip here, I go straight for his chin... See? His guard comes down, so I go from the hip here and extend straight at his chin So I popped him right on the chin! His knee started buckling, and I just went off on him! 1, 2, dodge, and a hook... Say, are ambulances fast? Mind if I stay a bit longer? Go ahead Sorry, man I thought about what grandma used to say Things work out for some people and they don't for others And then I remembered the minx She looked so sad then The minx is here Say... Will you come with me when I'm done with this load? Where? Walk me to the bus station No? OK Actually, I'm going back to my hometown How come? Mind if we take a detour? OK You don't say much, do you? I don't? But I know, people who don't say much are actually saying lots inside To tell the truth, I'm not much of a talker myself But I don't think it's a good thing All it does is distance people Right Know what I mean? Kind of I'm going to change Watch out for the puddle Say... Do you think I can jump over this puddle? No way Just imagine it It's a deep gorge If I fall, I won't come back I'd die Imagine it? No Please If I make it over this gorge, I get to be in a whole other world Imagine it? Yup Great I'm gonna make it Ready... Go! I did it! I did it! I made it! I made it! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! What'd you do? It's nothing Just a scratch OK, I can go home alone now Good-bye A long time ago, I used to think the gas tanks were always getting bigger Thanks No one came, man The minx forgot something again That's why I opposed it from the start Paint her nails, dye her hair, Like you can just dye anything... My eyes are peeled again today I'm a patrol officer, protecting the world from bad people. Pretty, huh? The pansies came out so nice But my eyes start hurting if I keep them peeled too long They get tired. So I closed my eyes like this sometimes I feel better with my eyes closed since I don't have to see anything I'll go do some grocery shopping first Dirty everything, leave things scattered all over the place... You expect people to live in that? " Property for sale " People like that... deserve to get sucked up by a vacuum cleaner My name is Mizue... a name I'm not too fond of I'm home Good to see you, tired? No, not really You'll have to share the room with your sister for now Sorry about that No problem Mizue, you're not hungry yet, right? I'll cook tonight But you must be tired I'm fine, really I used to have a dream Hello Hello One day, I'd leave this town and work at a flower shop in Tokyo That's it, that's all I wanted When I turned 24, I finally started living by myself in Tokyo Mizue Yes? I'm going to the bank Thank you And I fell in love He came to the shop just as we were closing, and asked to have flowers delivered that day He kept begging me, saying it was for a woman he loved I gave in to his eagerness and reluctantly accepted He wrote the woman's name on a paper and handed it to me The name he wrote was Yamada Mizue... me He loved to flatter me, and said I looked like Audrey Hepburn I didn't know who Audrey Hepburn was, so I rented a video with her in it It was called "Always" She was a very elegant... old lady We were so happy together Always meeting at the same place, chatting about silly things And time just seemed to fly On my birthday I waited for him at the usual place Starting in the afternoon, I waited for 8 hours, alone Hello? I can't go How come? You see, a baby... Sorry, one more time... A baby was born Wow, whose? I have a wife Hello? Hello... For some reasons, I found myself standing alone in a jewelry store Mmm, it's good Is it? Never seen anyone put broccoli in curry Really? A lot of people do it Maybe in Tokyo Nothing to do with Tokyo! C'mon, it's pretty good, huh? Nothing special From that moment, I started stealing like I was possessed And then I would toss them in the mail box Sorry for taking the bed I really don't mind sleeping on the floor... Say, are you into any boys? No I see Good night How long is sis staying here? For a long time I'm embarrassed. Everyone asks about her Don't say that Think about me, too. You'll have to be a bit more tolerant Why should I have to tolerate? It's sis's fault We can't help it. She's not normal No need to be uptight. We're all practically friends here I'm looking forward to it Honestly, we won't be able to pay much but I think you'll get a certain joy from working here Yes They'll be glad to have you Why don't you start tomorrow afternoon?

Sorry So funny! A camel...! I'll be going Have a good day. Thank you So what do you do? I made sure no one stole clothes at the coin laundry I mean your job It is my job That's not a job It is You're lying I'm not lying. Grandma owned the place Sound like a hell of a boring job It's not there anymore, though Grandma says she was tricked She looked real sad The entire place was taken away, huh? Everything? But there was one thing left behind Something a customer forgot It's not ours Well, sure So that's what I'm going to go deliver That thing left behind? The sea? It's the sea, so what? Can I open the window? So who's this chick? Her name's Mizue No, I mean, what's she to you? A customer? But she isn't just another customer, right? I'm asking if you like this woman Don't understand? Think about it. Who the hell would hitchhike... Just to deliver a dress someone forgot? All this way Is that normal? Is it? No, right? Of course it isn't Right? Yeah It's love That's what we call love I don't know about Mars, but on Earth at least, we call it love, remember that What're you writing? So I won't forget Well, it's nothing to write about... Don't let me stop you, though Wanna see? I'll let you see it A while back, I used to be a salaryman Can you believe it? Nope, not at all And that's when she came along At first, she wasn't anything Just another colleague Then one day, we decided to have a welcome party for her... in a tiny bar At first, everyone's just drinking and chatting But then this drunk guy got up... and told her to give them a talent show 'Course, she resisted. Said she was embarrassed I mean, what the hell is a 35 year-old lady supposed to do... in front of a bunch of guys, anyway? But everyone's cheering and goading her on, so she reluctantly gets up What do you think she did? She started cawing like a crow Crow? Yeah, and she didn't just open her mouth and go "caw" She did this weird thing with her mouth, and... ... she went over and over... ... Iike that A week later, she was gone Never found out what happened Probably had to deal with some crap Then this guy in the office tears up her resume and tosses it, saying he doesn't need it anymore, it's full of lies anyway... So I kinda finished it out, peeled this off and took it home I figure, even if the resume's a lie, the picture's gotta be real Beer My beer isn't here That was a long time ago Here you go You asshole! Sorry, didn't mean to get you involved Almost there You can walk from here Thanks Hey Take this Don't need it Take it for the thought Hey You ever need help, see me Hey!

I'm looking for someone named Mizue My sister isn't here But... Who're you? Who? What's she to you? What's she...? What're you here for? She left it there, so I'm delivering... What're you saying? I need to give her something, so... So you're looking for her? Right Where'd she go? She left again But I know where she is Really? I can tell you, but... you have to tell her something for me You walk fast There's a bus stop straight up this path Take that bus and it won't be long Don't get off in the middle Take it to the last stop, and ask for her when you get off OK Weird hat Grandma made it.

What're you doing out here? Asked someone at the apartment 'cause I'm delivering something, and... Delivering what? Your dress. You forgot it in the dryer But I have to apologize I washed it everyday after that Now it's all tattered Sorry So funny... Smells like detergent Thanks Can't see anything, right? There's nothing around here You're so strange. Coming all the way out here... But I'm happy Don't think I've ever been happier It's hard to put into words, but... It's love. On Earth, we call this love. I don't know about Mars, though Say... What? Can I turn the TV on? Sure So weird Sorry, did I wake you up? Sick? No, just can't get to sleep Hey, tell me a story What kind? Anything, like about yourself, or maybe a fairy tale... You're like a kid C'mon How about a story grandma told me a while back? Sure Heard it so often, I memorized it Yeah? What's it about? About a young man who's good at whistling Let's see... Once upon a time, somewhere, there was a poor young man He was a very good whistler Anytime he was happy about something, he'd whistle One day, he went to the sea There, he saw a ship in the distance and thought how wonderful it would be... if he could travel the world in it Happy with the thought, he gave a good whistle Right then, a sailor walked by, so the young man asked him, "Will you please put me on that ship? " The sailor told him, "Sure, if you hand over that thing you got there" The young man had a silver cup in his hand He was torn It was an important keepsake from his mother, you see But he finally gave the silver cup to the sailor He wanted to be on the ship more than anything And he was able to get on that ship But all of a sudden strong winds blew, and it became a terrible storm The ship was tossed, and it finally sank And? What happened then? I can't remember... What, is that supposed to be a sad story? A happy story? I'm not sure... Can you sleep now? Now with this on my mind I'll ask grandma tomorrow I got you! The camel Your sister told the camel Said you'd understand Oh! That's the message Almost forgot! You there? What's the matter? I'll never find out the ending I don't understand About what? They said grandma's dead What does that mean? Your shoelaces are untied I'm not much good at this What do you usually do? Grandma did it every morning You think I've changed? I said I'd change that day... Now that I'm back home, you think I've changed? A little bit How? Your hair's longer? I'll be going now Hey... Can I go with you? Why? I haven't heard the ending yet... The story about the good whistler I guess she's down there But she's not really there Because she's dead She's there, but she isn't Weird Can I ask you something? What? What about your parents? Don't know You don't know? Don't remember Grandma said... my memories are frozen in a big block of ice, and no one can get them out What should we do? What's that? Someone who drove me Said I should come if I need help I'm here Hello Hello You really come You see them flying at weddings and sports events, right?

My name is Teru It's actually Teruo, but everyone calls me Teru I work at a coin laundry I make sure no one steals any laundry I have a scar on my head When I was a kid, I feel in a manhole People say I have a scar on my brain, too My eyes are always peeled I'm a patrol officer protecting the city My name is... Teru... I fell in a manhole... I have a scar... On my brain, too... I have a scar... I keep watch... So no one steals... I watch... So no one steals any laundry... So no one steals... That's my... My... I saw a dream It was the ending to the story I told Mizue once, about the young man who was a good whistler After he fell off the ship during the storm, he was washed ashore That's when a beautiful girl walked by She noticed the young man, and tried to call for help, but no one was around But then she noticed the silver cup that washed up together She took the cup and went to fill it with water, and got him to drink from the cup Over and over, she made him drink When the young man was conscious again, he quietly stood up There was no one around Not the beautiful girl, not the precious silver cup So was it a sad story after all? Or a happy one? I really don't know The one thing I do know... is that the young man was glad to be alive Because after he got up, he faced the sea and gave a good whistle A year later I was thinking The whole time... In the end did I change at all? I'm getting off Please, let me off! Stop! Welcome home Figured you'd find me if I did this I got really good at this So let's have a wedding Let's do it here right now Imagine it We're in a church The bells are ringing, the priest is here, and everyone's smiling Imagine it?
