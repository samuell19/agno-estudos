- Get a move on, will ya? - I'm comin'. Bitch. Sean, get it in here and steer. - I'm steerin'. - What the? Jack, come on, we've got to go. - Oh, Christ, my head. - Now, come on. Now, I know this got a mention yesterday, but there's no harm in saying it again, a young man, Frank Gavin, went missing after last year's concert. You may have heard an interview Gary Jakes did with his sister Sandra yesterday. He's 23, five feet 10, with blonde hair. On TV and in the papers. If you were at last year's gig and you remember seeing anything suspicious, then make a phone call. I know his family would appreciate it. Next up, the first of our triple play from Blue Ghost, It's the Tremolo. - Chrissake, Jack, why do you do it? - I think it's what they call an involuntary reaction. - Come on, you know what I mean. - I feel a lecture coming on. - No lecture, Jack. It's your life. I just think it's a bloody waste of time, that's all. - What gives you the right to judge me? You go off and you get yourself married and all of a sudden you're mister responsibility, qualified to tell the world and his dog how to live their lives. We used to do this kind of thing together, Ben, and bloody often. - Five years ago. - What? - Five years ago, Jack. That's the last time you and I went on a bender together. And yeah, I'm married now. I've got two kids, Jack. I've got a business to run and they all depend on me. So yeah, I am mister fuckin' responsibility. And I'll tell you somethin' else, Jack, I wouldn't trade it for all the tea in China. - I know what your problem is, you're just jealous. - Jealous? Of what, for chrissake? - My freedom. Maria, the kids, the business, they're all fine, Ben, they just came too early for you. And maybe you look at me and the freedom I enjoy and maybe yeah, maybe jealous is the wrong word. Envious, I think you're envious. - I don't believe you. So what would you've had me done when I met Maria and fell in love with her? Tell her to go away and come back in five years? 'Cause I want to have a party with my good mate, Jack? Jesus, gimme a break, will ya? - I have nothing against marriage, Ben, I really don't. Just not in the next 10 years. It's like the saint said, "Oh lord, make me good but not yet." Look, Jack, I'm going to have to run, do you think you'll be able to find it? - Yeah, you go on, I'll be fine. - Jack, are you sure? - Yeah, get outta here. Morning, I parked a car here yesterday, a '98 silver Rover, and I can't seem to find it anywhere. - Well, the same thing happened last year. - How do you mean? - People parked here for the concert, left their cars overnight, came back the following day to find them stolen. - Stolen? Ah, fuck. - Well, you've no claim on me, now. You parked here at your own risk. - Ah, shit, fuck, fuck, fuck. - You know, if you need to use a phone... - No, listen, that's fine, I've got a mobile. Ah shit, they got my mobile as well. How far is your house? - Not far. - Hi. - Phone is there. - Thanks. Play. - Hello? - Oh god, no. - Leave him be. Are you deaf as well as stupid? I said leave him be! Sean, come on. No one's gonna harm you, there's no need to be afraid. Do what you're told and you walk outta here with a few bob in your pocket. Sean here will undo your gag so you can have a bite to eat. Now, you may ask no questions. Everything will become clear in time. Go on. - Who are you? What am I doing here? Let me out of these chains! Let me out of these chains, you shush-loving baggy bastard! Let me outta here, help! Help! - You know how far we're from the road here. I mean, there's not a chance anyone would hear anything. And we don't get any visitors. - Will you be quiet if I take the tape off your mouth? Hold still. - What's your name? - Amy, what's yours? - Jack. What does your father want with me, Amy? - He's not my father, he's my half-brother Henry. - And the other guy, the retard? - He's my brother Sean. Don't call him that. Shh! - What is it? Amy, you have to help me get out of here. - I can't. - Amy, please, you have to help me. The guy's crazy, he's gonna kill me. - He's not going to kill ya. I have to put the tape back on your mouth. If he knows I've been in here... - Will you have to take the blanket back? - No, he won't remember if he gave it to you or not. Set it down. Not there, you stupid woman, how's he gonna reach the damn thing there? Eat. Well, eat. - People are going to realize I'm missing. My friend dropped me at your very gate. Don't you think the police are gonna put it together? - No, I don't. - Why? - 'Cause I don't think they're smart enough. - No, I mean why am I here? - Jack Davis, age 25, - apartment 2 - B, Willow Court, Ranelagh, Dublin. Video club membership card. Gold Visa card. Member of the Professional Photographers Association of Ireland. Is that what you do, Jack? Photography? - Yeah. - I'd say you have a pretty good life, Jack. Got your own boss, your own apartment, good social life, plenty of cash, nice girls, and a nice car to pull them with, huh? - I'm not complaining. - I wish I had a good life, Jack. It's not as good as yours, never was. Let's just say in the game of life, I got dealt a pair of deuces. Now I reckon it's time to do a little bit of cheating, stack the odds in my own favor. - What are you talking about? - Do you know how long this place has been in my family's name? Go on, guess. - I have no idea. 152 years. Six generations of Roses. This place has been fought for, died for, killed for, been back-breakingly worked for. Those outhouses out there, they were built by my great-grandfather. There was no power tools then. It was hammers, saws, chisels, and a lot of sweat. That house across the yard? I was born there, so was Amy, so was Sean, and the five generations before us. - Look, whatever your problems are, I'm not any part of them. - No, but you are a part of the solution. - I don't get it, Henry, what am I doing here? Ransom money, is that it? Look, I've got no family. No, please. - Let's do this the easy way. - Look, you said it yourself, we're a long way from anybody hearing me. I suffer from bad sinus, Henry, if my nose plugged up I could suffocate, I can't be any use to you dead. - One word outta you... - One other thing. - What? - I can't sleep with my hands tied behind my back. - Right. - That's strange, I don't seem to be gettin' Jack anywhere. - Jack? What do you mean? - Well he's not at his apartment and he's not as his studio, his mobile phone is either switched off or dead. - Jack is probably away on a shoot somewhere, sun beatin' down and surrounded by babes. - I don't think so, he wouldn't have missed his chance to rub my nose in that. - I wouldn't worry. Just give it a few days, then try him again. - Help me get out of here, Amy. - I can't. Only Henry has the keys and I don't know where he keeps them. - Then call the guards. Why do you stay here, Amy? - Where would I go? - Anywhere out of here. Look, I see the way he treats you, like dirt. - Supposing I leave here, what then? I can't leave without Sean. He wouldn't come anyway. - So leave Sean here. - He'll be put into the institution. - Who told you that? - Henry. - Amy, we don't have places called institutions anymore. We haven't done for at least 30 years, don't you watch TV? No TV? Newspapers, right? You read newspapers? - Henry says they're full of lies. - Amy, you can't allow yourself to be trapped here for the rest of your life. - No way out, not without Sean. - Then leave Sean here. Look, if you can't save both of you, then save yourself. - Sean is my flesh and blood, my little brother. He hero worships Henry, he knows no better, he hasn't the sense. - The sense to see that Henry is using him to keep you here. Look, Amy, I'm afraid he's taken me for ransom and I've got no money and he's gonna kill me. - He hasn't, he, he won't hurt you. - Amy, do you know why I'm here? - No, I don't, but I know he'll let you go. - Amy, he can't let me go. If I go to the guards, he'll go to jail and he can't take that risk. Fuck, fuck! Come on. Damn. - Where'd you get those? - Henry bought these for me. - I've been thinkin', Sean, would you like to live in a town? - What do you mean? - Well, I've been thinkin' we could get a house or a flat in a town. You could make lots of new friends. You could go to the cinema and play football and do lots of things you can't do here. - Yeah, Amy, or, Henry won't like that, Amy. - I was thinkin' just you and me could live in a town. Like you said, I don't think Henry would like it. - I'm not goin' anywhere without Henry, Amy, Jesus. Henry's my best, he's my best friend. - Sean, sometimes people can appear to be something they're not to get something they want. Not everything Henry does is good or right, Sean. Do you think it's right that we take someone like Jack and keep him tied up? Do you not think he's got friends and family that miss him? - Yeah, but Amy, Henry said that sometimes you have to do things that are bad for the greater good. Yeah. - What is that greater good, Sean? Sean, answer me. Sean, answer me. Sean, go up to bed. - Amy, I'm reading my comic. - Read it in bed, now go. - You stupid bitch. You hear me, ya stupid bitch? What do you think you're doin', leavin' stuff lyin' around the place? You have my family. I'll kill you first, you and all your damn family. And that traitorous bitch you're married to. - Go to sleep, Sean. - What was the commotion about? Henry's drunk, but it's okay, he's asleep now. Thanks. - Where do you live? - Dublin. - What's it like, Dublin? - Fast, shitty, and expensive. But a lot more than that. It's got pubs and restaurants and cafes and little parks tucked away here and there. There's loads of shops and cinemas and theaters, whatever you fancy. It's home. Haven't you ever been? - Well, twice, when I was a child. That was to go to the hospital. What do girls my age do? Well they do lots of things, they meet up with their other friends and mostly on the weekends and, I don't know, enjoy themselves. They meet at up at each others' houses and they have a drink or two while they get ready to go out. Then they go out together and have a few more drinks and have a laugh and then they go dancing. Haven't you got any friends, Amy? - No. - Henry? What do you enjoy doing? - I like to read a lot. I listen to music sometimes. And I like drawing, too. - You must draw me a picture sometime. Here, you're freezing, get under here. Go on. It gets so cold in this place sometimes I wish it would burn down. That's the second time I've seen you smile tonight. I guess you don't get much reason to smile. Henry. - What? - It's 10 o'clock, we'll be late for mass. - We'll get to the next one. - But you don't like getting that one. Why not? One mass is as good as another. - Yes, but... - But I'd run into them, is that it? Well, I'm sick and tired of dancing around people. One mass for the sinners at the parish, another one for their gentry, and one in-between just to keep 'em separated, well fuck 'em! Now get out. Go on, get out! Where are you going? - Change my clothes. - You'll change nothing. You stay in those clothes today. You too, Sean. Sean, go find somethin' to do. Go on! What time are you? - What? - You know what I mean. How long since? Answer me, how long since? - About three weeks. Go on, get the breakfast on. - Take care. Who's that? - That was Dave Castles. - Who's Dave Castles? - He's a guy that works with Jack. Jack was supposed to turn up for a job this morning, he never did. I'm gettin' worried, Marie. I've never known Jack to do somethin' like this. Look, I'm gonna go to his apartment. - But that's 30 miles away. - Yeah, I know, but suppose he's up there unconscious or something. I'm gonna have to check it out. - We really should've gone to the guards about this, now I can't be openin' up apartments without people's permission. - Look, I'm really concerned about this, Jack is a very good friend of mine, okay? And how are he gonna be able to give his permission if he's inside unconscious or somethin'? Will you please open the door? - Hello? Hello? Hello? - Oh shit. Go on, get out. Well, Jack, today's your lucky day. Don't you want to know why? - I'm sure you're gonna tell me. - Today, Jack, you're gonna get married. That's right, Jack, you're gonna get married. - To? - To Amy, who else? - You're a crazy fuck. What are you gonna do for a priest, kidnap him too? There's no call for a priest. If a ship's captain can marry a couple, then by god a landowner can too. - Okay, Henry, what's this about? What's your plan, huh? - Well the plan is, Jack, that you marry Amy and give her a son. Now when you've that done, you'll be given 10,000 and sent on your way. The boy will stay here, be given the name Rose, and carry on the family farm. - You're an insane bastard. And if I don't give Amy a son? - Well, assuming that you've put a bit of effort into it, you'll be given 5,000 and sent on your way. - Supposing I do give Amy a son, and you do give me 10,000, what if I go to the police? Tell them what's been happening here? Forget to mention the 10,000, make a claim on the boy, and give him my name, Davis, what then, Henry? You haven't even tried to make it believable. No, I'll tell you the plan. I go through this charade you've concocted, I give Amy a son, or a daughter, or maybe nothing at all, and then you kill me. 'Cause there's just no other way, is there, Henry? You're a crazy fuck, do you hear me? You're a crazy fuck! How did it go? - Well, Jack hasn't been back to his apartment since he left to come here last weekend. - How do you know? - I searched through the whole place, the clothes he wore here last weekend are not there. - Well maybe he washed them and he's wearing them now again or something. - No, Maria, I know Jack is not exactly tidy, but it's a complete mess. There's mold growin' on leftovers up there. - What are you gonna do? - I'll go talk to the guards. - Hold that. Get up. - I've heard of shotgun weddings, Henry, but this is ridiculous. Into your left. On your knees. Hands above your head. - Henry, he's lookin' at me. - Just keep the gun on him, Sean. Now you can have a bath and a shave. - Any chance of a little privacy? - Don't take your eyes off him, Sean. Get. - This is crazy, Henry. - What? - Can't you see? This is wrong. - And you think this is wrong? - If we're going to lose the farm, what difference is it going to make... - We're not going to lose the farm. Why the hell do you think I'd bother to hunt you where that there would some debate over? No, the only reason that you and Sean have a roof over your head, food in your bellies, and beds to come into is my generosity, now don't fuckin' wear it out. You know where Sean will go. They're dark and dorky places, Amy. They don't have bedrooms, they have cells. And they're abused and beaten by the minders in every way you can imagine. The only good thing is that they don't tend to live that long. 20, 25 years, maybe. Now you remember that. Oh, thanks. Here's that. Now, let's see if I got this straight, Mr. Lambert. This friend of yours, this Jack Daley. - Davis, his name is Jack Davis. - All right. So he lives in Dublin, but he came down to stay with you the night because you're both going to this concert the next day. So, how come you brought the two cars in? - Well I had a few things to do out there, so I told Jack to go ahead and I'd meet him up there. - So Jack drove in on his own? And left his car where? - In a field somewhere along the Ballymun Road. - After the concert, what then? - Let's keep this brief and to the point. Stand up, both of you. - Don't worry, Amy, something tells me we'd have ground for annulment. Amy, do you take this man to be your husband? - I do. Jack, do you take this woman to be your wife? - I do. - Right, you're now man and wife. - Now why couldn't you just go home and leave him there? - Well, because he was drunk. Because he hadn't a clue where he was. And he would never would've found his way back to my place on his own. - So you drove him home? And what time was that? It was about 2:30, three o'clock. - And the next morning, then, you drove him back in to pick up his car. Where did you drop him off? - About half a mile from the concert site. - And he couldn't remember where he'd left his car the night before? - No, he couldn't. I was in a hurry that day, so I had to leave him. - And you haven't seen him since? - No, I haven't. - I see. Mr. Lambert, do you have any idea of the number of people that are reported missing every year in this country? - No, I don't. - Quite a few, quite a few. But the good news is that 99% of them turn up safe and sound. You see, there's nothing unusual in a young man just getting into his car and driving off into the sunset. - I don't believe that's what's happened. - We'll see, we'll see. - Amy, go on up to bed. - I'll just clear up a few things. - Go on up now. I keep these for celebrations and special occasions. - And which is this? - It's a bit of both. - So putting your sister through a sham of a marriage and forcing her to sleep with a stranger, that's a special occasion in your book, is it, Henry? - She's my half-sister. - Ah, give me a break. And what about your half-brother? Does Sean know that if Amy went away, you'd throw him into an institution? Would that be a special occasion and time to break out the cigars again, Henry? - How's he mean, Henry? - Don't mind him, Sean. He's done on legacies. - You're a cold and vicious man, Henry Rose. You bring unhappiness into every life you touch. The world needs you like it needs cholera. - Open his ankle chains. Open it. Now, let's see what else you can do besides talk. - Amy, you're gonna have to help me get outta here. You can use a phone, can't you? Call the police. Amy, what are you afraid of? None of that is true, what Henry told you about Sean going to an institution. You'd both be looked after, I promise you, I'll make certain of it. Amy, if you don't help me get out of here, he's gonna kill me. - Henry is many things. He can be mean and cruel, but he is not a killer. - Oh, Amy, wake up, will you? He doesn't have a choice. If he's willing to go to these lengths to ensure an heir to his damn farm, do you really think he's gonna take the risk of letting me go? - He will let you go, I know he will. - If he kills me, if he kills me, and they find out you could've stopped it but didn't, you could go to prison too. Oh, Amy. There's something I can't figure out. If he's so hell-bent on having an heir to the farm, why doesn't he get married himself? - He already did once, about 10 years ago. To a local girl, Cathy Evans. Henry was different then. What happened? She found out that Henry would never be able to father any children. A bad accident when he was a child. So she left him. And within a year, she married Dan Callaghan. That's who she locked up. She just couldn't face the prospects of having no children. That's when Henry began to change. Jack, Jack, I think he's coming. Jack. - Get dressed. Shh. Sean, get on his back. Hold on to his neck chain. - Mornin', Henry. - Sergeant. - Not a bad bit of weather we're havin'. - What can I do for ya? Apparently some young lad went missin', at the concert last week. Hasn't been seen since. - Is that right? We're callin' in to all the houses in the area, see if anyone might've seen or heard anything. - I dunno anything about any young lad. - You used your field to help for parkin' that day, didn't you? - That's right, so did a few other farmers around the place. It's not a crime, is it? No. He was drivin' a silver Rover, '98 reg. Ring any bells with you? - No, I really couldn't tell you what was parked out there. - It's strange, though. - What? - Exactly a year ago another fella went missin'. Same location, too. What's this his name was? Frankie Gavin, wasn't it? - I really couldn't remember. Well, if you think of anything, give us a call. I hope you don't make a habit of leavin' these things lyin' around. - I was just about to go shoot some rabbits. - You have a number of these yokes, haven't you? - They're an interest of mine. Make sure you keep 'em locked up and safe. How are ya, Amy? You okay? - She's run out, her tablets. I must go into town now and get some. Her nerves, you know. - You take care of yourself, Amy. Henry. - Your luck is running out, pal. Sean, chain him up. Aye. And get a gag on him. I deflocked him. And you ever try anything like that again and I swear to god I'll kill ya. It happened before, last year. - I know this guy. What does this mean? Are you telling me this is what happened to this guy? I'm telling you so that you'll know, he will let you go. He let him go. - Amy, he's still missing. - No he's not. - Ah, shit! - And you are going to learn to do what you're told. I'd save the man. - Hi, Mr. Rose, Sean. - Hello, Sally. - Put your tongue back in your gob, will ya? Well? For chrissake, Amy, what did he say? Are ya or aren't ya? - Pull into Dotty's, I need to get a few things. - What for? We need nothin'. - I need to get women's things. - Hello, Amy. How are you keepin', love? - Fine, Dotty. - What'll I get ya, love? - Brown soda please, Dotty. Dotty, why do you still have that poster up? I don't think he's been missin' now for a while. - Indeed he has, love. Poor lad, whatever happened to him. That'll be good for. - That'd be good too? But you only said that about dead people. - Hate to say it, Amy, but looks like the poor lad is dead. I know, it's scary, isn't it? Thing could happen around here. Will I put you down on the slate, love? Poor child. - Come on, will ya? Amy. Now you did understand what I said to you? Look, you've nothing to worry about. This is gonna make such a difference. To have a young lad on the farm. I'll have something to work for, we all will. Someone to carry on the place when we're gone. It's all any man wants. - What'll people say? - They won't say anything, they'll still have me to deal with. - Maybe not to our faces, but behind our backs they will. - Look, in the eyes of god, you're a married woman. Now that's all you need to remember. - Are you going to let Jack go? - Sure. - When? - Today, tomorrow, I dunno, soon. - I'm bringing him over some sandwiches. - Well go on, then. - What do you want me to do? - You're willing to help me? - Yes. - Phone the police, that's all you have to do. - Well, I was beginning to think you didn't have it in ya, city boy. - What are you talking about? Didn't Amy tell you? You're going to be a daddy. - Amy, is it true? - Yeah. - Well, guess I'll be having one or two more of your cigars, huh, Henry? 'Cause it's to be a special occasion in your book, huh? - You bet. - Well why stop at cigars? Why don't we all do something special tonight? A nice dinner, maybe. - Henry, if we have dinner, can I get some bread and butter puddin'? - Why sure you can. How about some ice cream with hot melted chocolate poured over? - And lemonade? - And lemonade. And for me, Amy, you can dig out the biggest T-bone you have in the freezer. And with lots of mushrooms and onions and gravy. Whatever you want yourself. Now, come on, kids, outta here. We got lots of things to do before dinner. - Aren't you forgetting something? - What's that? - Seems you have nothing to celebrate if it weren't for me. - I'm sure we can dig out another steak for ya. But I don't want steak. Everybody else is getting what they want, why can't I? - Well now, you're catching me in a good mood here. What is it ya want? - Sicilian-style aubergines with a side dish of mushrooms. Sauteed with olive oil, brown sugar, and crushed garlic. Yeah, and a bottle of Chianti, at least four years old. Okay, you can forget about the Chianti. - You trying to make fun of Amy? - No. - She's no fancy cook-like. But she can fry you up a steak with the best of 'em. - I think I saw an Italian restaurant in town. I'm worth a takeaway, surely. - I know where it is. I could go in and get what he wants there. - No. He eats what we eat or he doesn't eat at all. - Henry, can I speak to you a minute? Let's call a spade a spade. We both know what this means for me. You're not gonna deny a condemned man his last meal, are you? - I'll write it out for you. Sean can run in and get it. Now come on, you two, there's work to be done. - One thing I was wondering about. - What was that? - Why me? - Well, you may not remember it, it was me takin' the money at the gate that mornin'. I was lookin' for a young man, fit and healthy and on his own. - There must've been more than one guy on his own. There were five that fitted the bill. You were the only one that didn't look like a fuckin' weirdo. Now, what was that fried muck you wanted, again? - This is for takeaway? - Yeah, I'm takin' it away. - Right, okay. All right, that'll take a couple of moments. Sorry, excuse me. Hello, can I help you? Just one moment, please, thank you. Order in, chef, it's a takeaway, a Sicilian-style aubergine with a side order of mushroom sauteed in olive oil, brown sugar, and garlic. - Let me see that. Lorraine, who gave you this? - The weirdo at the counter. - Excuse me. - Yeah, okay. I'm not picky. - Right, just give him his order. - Okay, right. - Take his money, okay? Mario, you're in charge now, I've got to go out. No problem. - What kind of muck is that? I never knew a man who preferred pig food to a good steak, huh? - Shit! Fucking believe it. Fuck! - Where are you going? - I'm just going to give the cat some milk. - You stupid bitch. Give me the key. Give me the fuckin' key! He's headin' for the river. Sean! Sean! - No! No! - Come on. - I'm going. - You go that way, Sean. I'll meet ya at the shed. - What exactly is it you expect me to do? Some fella comes into your restaurant and orders fancy mushrooms, and you want me to call out the light brigade? - They're not fancy mushrooms, they're disgustin', actually. But Jack likes 'em, that's the point. They're not on our menu, they're Jack's own concoction. In five years, I've never known anyone to order mushrooms like that, and he always orders 'em with the same main course, Sicilian-style aubergines. - Look, Mr. Lambert, I've had a long day and the last thing I need right now is a cookery lesson. Where did you say this farm was, anyway? - Ashbrook. - Ashbrook, that's six or seven miles out the Ballymun Road. I'll tell ya what I'll do, first thing in the mornin', although there's probably a perfectly simple explanation, I'll send a man out there to have a look around. How does that sound? - That sounds like you're not doin' your job, detective. - Oh, my leg in. - Come on. Come on. Come on. - Where'd you get this? - Henry, I only got it 'cause you wouldn't get me one. - You don't have anyone to ring, you fool. Is this Jack's? Is it Jack's? - Yeah. - You bloody fool. I'm sorry. Come on. - Amy! Amy! - What the fuck? - Get him up. - Jack. How could you guys do this? - It's the child that matters now, not him! - Don't, please, I'm begging you, don't do this, please. Damn it! - Are we not gonna put him inside? - What kind of damn fool are you, huh? Do you wanna go in prison? Do you want Sean to go to prison? - No. - Am I the only one thinking clearly around here, hm? Stay in there. - Oh, no, oh! - Get him up! Just lock him up, Henry. - Come on, Sean. - We could just lock him up. Hey, lock him up. - Right, gimme that. Keep an eye on him. I'm not a totally unreligious man, Jack. If you have any words to say to your maker, you better make it now. - My only prayer is that Amy and my child get outta here and that you rot in hell. Gimme the gun. Give me the gun. No! - Shoot! - What? - Who the fuck is that? Who is he? Some friend of yours, Jack? Don't worry, the hole is big enough for the two of you. - Don't you get it, Henry? If he put things together, so can other people. - You've just spoken your last words. - Sean. Sean. - Amy. - Sean. Sean. Sean. - Amy. Do you think you'll want to come back? - I don't know. - Why don't we try this, we won't make an appointment for you today, but if you ever want to come back, you only need to lift the phone. - Thanks. - Sean, how's he doing? Oh, he's in great form. He really likes Claremont. And he's spending Christmas with us this year. - Oh, that's good. - Well, I suppose I should be off. Thanks for everything, Linda. - You can always send me a Christmas card and send me some photos of Christine. - I will. Okay. Thanks again. - Okay. - Amy.
