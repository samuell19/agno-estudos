- I'm sorry about the love thing. And the sex thing. It's just... I guess I didn't know what I was saying... until I said it. Except... I said it. - So you're saying you don't love me? - I'm not saying I... don't love you. Or that I might not love you. One of these days. I just didn't mean it when I said it. I used to think that we had an unlimited amount of opportunity to reinvent and define ourselves with the arrival of every new sunrise. Now I'm not so sure. Anyway. Thank you for not coming inside of me. I really appreciate it. I wasn't in my right mind last night. - You're tuned to Catonsville Public Radio on this fine Tuesday morning. Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations as performed by the Davis Senior High School Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Angelo Moreno brings another hour of light classical favorites to a close. Two minutes shy of the top of the hour, so that means it's time for us to check in with our very own Ralph Kirk for an update on your morning commute. How's it looking out there, Ralph? Ralph? - Shelby! Thank you. This traffic report is brought to you by Cosima at Mill Number One. You're looking at a free and easy ride on the topside of the beltway in a fairly incident-free stretch from Perring Parkway all the way to the 795 split. Southbound Harbor Tunnel, this is a mess. You are jammed with both lanes closed due to an overturned tractor trailer. Fire and police are on the scene and you've got rubbernecking every which way. I'm Ralph Kirk for Catonsville Public Radio. - Thanks, Ralph. Support for this morning's selection of classical music favorites is brought to you by Lily Schlump with Yerman and Conklin Realty. Don't trust the purchase of your new home or the sale of your existing one to just anybody. "Think Schlump," Lily Schlump, Yerman and Conklin Realty. So many more classical music favorites coming up at the top of the hour, so keep your dial tuned to Catonsville Public Radio. - Looks like you still have a soft spot for the novelty of yesteryear. - Thank you for taking time out of your presumably very busy day to share a moment with us. - The pleasure is all mine. I couldn't be happier to have this dialogue with the good folks over at Baltimore Commerce Journal. - Very good. Now, Mr. Prattleton-- - Please, call me Joel. - You're something of a rising star here at Rosen, Prattleton, Nagel & Suffield. In just a few short years, you've graduated from business school and established yourself as this firm's preeminent brand marketing manager. How did you pull off such a lofty feat? - Well, Ashley, with modesty and in all candor, I like to think of myself as something of a modern day Horatio Alger success story. The embodiment and personification of capitalist opportunity for all, a triumph of American exceptionalism. - On the subject of opportunity, as Tyler Prattleton's only scion and the only heir to his enormous publishing empire, some might posit that you're being groomed as his eventual successor. - Right now, the primary focus in my life is devoting my abilities to our valued clients here at Rosen, Prattleton, Nagel & Suffield. - Would you deny that you're in line to succeed your father at the reins of Prattleton Publishing? - I would argue that my available energies are more wisely utilized by listening to the needs of our current clients and serving them as capably as I possibly can. - I would counter that you're merely biding your time with a honey of a deal that landed you a vanity partnership at the very firm that manages your father's brand. - That would seem to be a misguided and ill-advised use of my intellect and personal skill set. - In short, where would you find yourself if it weren't for the good graces of your family's storied lineage? - If not for the love and support of our parents, where would any of us find ourselves? It just doesn't seem to be an issue that is particularly exclusive to me or my family. - Very few people in the Baltimore business community cast a shadow as outsized as your father's. - I certainly can't deny that. But no one can say that they have the luxury of choosing the sort of life that we're born into. - Is there any room in the already crowded personal narrative of Joel Prattleton to consider the crushing socioeconomic and racial divide that is cannibalizing our city from the inside out? - Well, sure. It's something that we think about and reflect upon all of the time. - Who's we? - You know. The proverbial "we." - Our collective lack of moral conscience? - I just think that sometimes we all find ourselves lost in the weeds of the theoretical and everybody deserves the occasional reprieve from wearing the weight of the world upon one's shoulders. - What a luxury of incalculable worth. - We have an appointment. - Aneta? - Kostadinova. - And Natalya-- - Aleksandrova. - Since you're both new patients, I'm just need to collect some more information from you. So fill this out if you would. - Blogodaria. - Is all of this really necessary? - I'm sorry? - The unrelenting cacophony of traditional seasonal favorites? - Be sure to stick with us after the top of the hour and join me on a seafaring search for reclusive Eastern Shore culinary wizard Roy Gussy and his much-sought-after recipe for crab and shrimp au gratin. Doesn't that sound delicious, folks? If you're only just now joining us here on Charm TV, our guest is Priscilla Hollingsworth. She's here to talk about her new book, "I Thought I Had Cancer, But I Didn't." A memoir, if you will, chronicling her whirlwind experience coming perilously close to death, except she didn't, everything's okay, and she's here to talk with us on the program today. Please join me in welcoming Miss Hollingsworth. - Thanks. Thanks for having me. - So you thought you had cancer. - Yep. - But you didn't. - I know, right? - Maybe delve into the swirling mix of emotions I'm sure you must have experienced during this whole excruciating affair. Take us inside the "story behind the story." - Right, yeah. Well, um. I thought I had cancer. - Right. - But I didn't. - Perhaps with the broadest strokes of an orator's brush, paint a picture of your mind set at the time. Outline some of the very trying challenges I'm sure you had to face. - Then you wouldn't have a reason to buy the book, now would you? Wait, which camera am I looking at here? This one? Purchase my book at all your fine local booksellers everywhere. You won't regret it. Well, I mean if a young person had cancer, that'd be really scary. So... it's almost like a horror genre. Except that it's real and it really happened. - I know! To me! I didn't say that it went well. On the plus side, I do think that you can really see my passion to sell the book shining through. - Miss Hollingsworth, part of your responsibility as a member of the Prattleton Publishing family is to make a healthy effort to promote your title and thus your brand as an emerging author. And you are not holding up your end of the bargain. - I don't know what you expect me to... I don't know, what? - Feign an interest in being engaged. Very simple. - I really feel like the work should just speak for itself. It has become a farcical spectacle for me to keep hashing this out over and over again when the whole point of this exercise was for me to sit down and come up with the most concise and effective way of communicating an idea in the most enjoyable way possible. - I see. - So I did that. So why now must I be obligated to go out there and jibber-jabber through the whole whoever-what on a daily basis with a bunch of Nancy Nobodies and Jerry Come Latelies? - You will do it because the terms of your advance oblige you to make a reasonable effort to promote your title and your brand as an author. - Let me see what I can do. It's been a tough year for ideas. - I would actually argue that it's been a banner year for ideas. But, unfortunately, in terms of their execution and to the question of how much energy and how many resources have been allocated in pursuit of those ideas, it's been a much more lackluster stretch. - Joel? Is that you? - Sure, why not? - Thought so. - Guilty as charged. - You guys here to see Alan? - No, I'm just... just here for my morning coffee. - Morning buzz with a half-shot of raspberry? - You know me so well. - Care to introduce me to your friend? - I'm Jonathan. - Jonathan, nice to meet you. Joel never was one for introductions. - Nice to meet you too... - Shawnee. - Shawnee. - How'd you find yourself keeping such exquisite company, Jonathan? - I am the senior in-house brand marketing consultant at Rosen, Prattleton, Nagel & Suffield. So, of course, we all know Joel here. - Of course. - I guess I should be leaving you two to your devices. Coffee's on me. Just consider it complements of the house. Excuse me. - Shawnee? I just wanted to thank you for the complimentary coffee. It was a truly unnecessary gesture, which is why I suppose I appreciated it all that much more. - Yeah, no worries. Make it a great day. - So, what was that all about? - I'm sorry. Is the music too soft? - Uh uh. - I just love the holidays. - So what's going on in the world? - Izvinyavai? - I said, "what's going on in the world?" How long is it going to be before I see Doctor Grappa? - Ma'am. I can assure you that once Doctor Grappa has attended to his previously scheduled appointments, we'll be able to fit you right in. - But this is a dental emergency. - Ma'am. Doctor Grappa will address your dental emergency in due course. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding. - What a load of malarkey. - You know, I am just not feeling it today. - Hmm. - Do you think there are people out there who do what we do and take genuine pleasure in what they do? - Are you saying that you're lacking in job satisfaction? - That's not exactly it. But then, I rarely wear a smile on my face when I walk into work everyday. - Everybody takes joy in different things in their own unique way. - I wonder if I am surreptitiously sabotaging my best efforts because of an underlying dislike of myself and an ingrained distrust of an established process. - I think that you're once again over-analyzing and intellectualizing something that is supposed to be a fun, effortless and sometimes even enjoyable experience. - Well? What's the alternative? - It could start with something as simple as how you greet the day. It's about interrupting repetitive and detrimental thoughts and seeing what impact that has on your everyday behavior. - That sounds like an awfully lofty feat. - Why isn't today the day that you sever your addiction to all of the compulsive habits that contribute to your inability to follow through on achieving established goals? - Maybe I just don't want to. I like the way that I live. I have very loosely defined medium term goals that rarely consume a burdensome amount of my time and energy. It's a comfortable place for me to be and I happen to think that's all perfectly peachy, for now. - Maybe that's because you haven't fully realized the negative repercussions of your actions and decisions. You're frittering away your most precious resource and undervalued asset: your vital years, rich with promise and good health. - Then I guess them's the breaks. - I guess so. - Thanks for joining us. I'm Petunia Floringbrickle. Sickness. Health. Despair. Solace. Uncertainty. Revelation. This is the story of our guest, author Priscilla Hollingsworth. Her debut memoir, "Evocation of a Lost American - One Woman's Journey," was the recipient of an honorable mention at the 2012 Mid-Atlantic Regional Book Festival. Now, she finds herself here in our studio to discuss her latest book, the unambiguously titled, "I Thought I Had Cancer, But I Didn't." Ms. Hollingsworth, thank you for taking the time to share with us today. - Thank you for... Yep. - Do you believe the memoir as a narrative tradition is in crisis? - I think that it is wonderful that so many people are sharing their personal experiences and perspectives with the world. - Can you point to a recent memoir that you've personally enjoyed? - Well, I've been busy writing my own, so... come on, who's got time for that? - Let's talk about the title of your new book. - Oh yes, let's do. - Was there ever a moment in which you considered another title to be more appropriate? - I don't see what you mean. - Well, in your title you boldly propose your central conflict. You thought you had cancer. - Oh yeah, I sure did. - And yet, in the same breath, you reveal the resolution of that conflict. You didn't. - Yeah. My publisher wasn't crazy about the original title, I can tell you that much. - Which was? - I'm sorry? - What was the original title of your book? I don't have to say, do I? The original title of the book was what? - "Terminally Ill For Awhile." - "Terminally Ill" ... - "For Awhile." Because my thinking was, aren't we all terminally ill for awhile? Although, sometimes it's just a little while. - Your critics say that this book trivializes the very real heartbreak and tragedy that someone unfortunate enough to be in the throes of an incurable illness would feel. - Well, I say that's just a big of bunch of hooey. - Really? - Yes! Because that's not what this book is about. Them or my critics. This book is about me! That's what it's about. - The memoir in crisis, this hour of the Petunia Floringbrickle Show. If you're just now tuning in, our guest is esteemed author Priscilla Hollingsworth, who will be with us for ... the remainder of the hour. So please, dear listeners, don't touch that dial. - So how are you liking it here in the States? - I love America. I love the 21st century. - Aw, that's swell. - I like American movies very much. - Really? - Yes! Matt Damon. I like Matt Damon very much. - So what's your favorite movie? - I think "Spaceballs." - Really? - Yes, "Spaceballs" is really the best. - That's a good one. I like movies. You know, with a couple of laughs. The lighter stuff. - Mhm. - So? - Did you see the news? - Yeah. - I probably should have called you before word started getting around. - That guy. - His family is understandably devastated. - It certainly doesn't look good. - I didn't say that it looked good. - I didn't say that you did. - He swore up and down it was that Jerry guy who set him up. It's just sad that his family probably won't ever know what really happened. - Except what was he doing with Jerry in the first place? Why else were they both there at the house if they weren't... - You know none of that proves anything anyway. - It just doesn't add up. And it doesn't look good. - Well. That's life in the big city, huh, kid? - This is maybe the worst book tour event I've ever seen. - I know. It's so sad and pathetic that I actually feel morally guilty about goofing on it. - What are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? I'm autographing my book so that you'll have signed copies in stock. - You know that once you sign copies of those books we can't return them to the publisher and get our money back. - You know what? It's not my fault that you didn't make any effort to promote my in-store appearance! - We did everything we could to promote your appearance! It's not our fault no one cares about your pointless book. - Burn... - In publishing news this week, local author Priscilla Hollingsworth sets a new sales record. Although you'd have to wonder if it's the sort of record that her publisher would be proud to tout. Ms. Hollingsworth's new memoir, "I Thought I Had Cancer, But I Didn't," debuted to the worst opening week of sales of any book release in recent history. Selling a mere seven copies nationwide. Anyway, we tracked down one of the few people who actually purchased this beleaguered tome. I think we have him on the phone with us right now. Hello there. Hello? Okay, well let's get right to it. How was it? Oh, it was horrible! - Buck up, squirt. There's always a light at the end of the tunnel. - I know what everyone must be saying about me behind my back. That I'm a laughing stock! I'm a farce. A pitiful rube. - I personally think that your whole assessment of the situation more accurately reflects your narcissistic preoccupation with yourself. But who am I kidding? - I don't understand. - The entire supposition of your argument is that everyone is so absorbed in your perceived cult of personality that they're constantly speculating on your failures and shortcomings as a human being. - They're not? - Nevermind. Forget I said anything. Can I buy you a drink? - It's utterly useless! I accept defeat. - Priscilla. We're all frauds and we're all failures. It's really okay. You just have to have a sort of light-hearted spirit about the whole thing. Otherwise, you will make yourself mental. - I never should have written that book. What was I thinking? - It's important to confront your failures. If you can look at it with a detached eye, maybe you can detach yourself from some of the disappointment you're feeling. - I yearn to conjure the wild imagination of my inner soul. - Maybe you should try your hand at poetry. - Is this your idea at a solution? - You seem to have a knack for it. You should take it as a compliment. Beaudelaire was a real rascal. - People spend so much of their lives judging other people. And yes, I think that to some extent we all make choices in our lives. But, in a lot of ways, we have no choice to be anyone other than who we are. We are who we are, and we can work to improve certain aspects of our chosen behavior, but it's really difficult to be anyone other than who we are. Ugh. It's an endless cycle of loathing. We wish that other people would change for us, we get upset at them for being so inflexible, they get upset at us for being disappointed, we get upset at ourselves for being so controlling, and so it goes. - That's an awfully dire leap from the uplifting pleasantries I was attempting to muster. - I guess that's because there's bluster and then there's honesty. - I must bid you adieu. There is a taxi stand two blocks up. You play it safe out there. I have something to get off my chest. - I'm listening. - There are a lot of reasons not to be happy in this world. To wake up everyday and look out on a gray and overcast sky and just dread the thought of hobnobbing with your contemporaries and acquaintances. But locking me away in a room with just my own thoughts and a pen and notebook paper. I'm just saying that's not such a great idea. Sometimes it brings out the worst in me. When I start writing, I get into a mood. But then... I've been in that mood for as long as I can remember. - I think you should have another drink. - You know what? You should buy a plane. - Hey. Aren't you Tyler's boy? - Miss Hollingsworth, in the flesh. - Prattleton Junior, in all of your repugnant glory. - I see that your new book had an exciting launch last week. - It's been a barrel of laughs. - Well, hey, that's life in the big city, huh, kid? - You know, Goldie Hawn's daughter? - No, I'm sorry. It just doesn't ring a bell. - Seriously? How do you not know who Kate Hudson is? People tell me I look like her all the time. Seriously? - So what do you do for a living? - I imagine you've heard me on the radio. 104 The Jammer? Baltimore's Best Rock Radio? Crazy Sammy and the Morning Drive-Time Crack-Up Crew? Anyway, I do a lot of voiceover work for FM radio commercials. - Oh, that sounds intriguing. Anything I might recognize? - "If you haven't been to visit Ikaros "at our new location in Greektown, "it's like you've never been at all. "Enjoy the dishes you love "in an intimate new locale, "served with a fresh new spirit "Come back and see us. "Your table is waiting." - No, I'm sorry. - I can't believe you don't know who Kate Hudson is. - Good morning and welcome to another lovely day here in Maryland. And it couldn't be a more perfect day to kick off our spring fund-raising campaign. I'm sure that, right now, you're idling in weekday morning traffic with road rage and tempers flaring at every turn. Isn't it refreshing to know that you can find solace in our curated selection of light classical music favorites? But have you ever wondered how do we do it? Day after day, week after week, month after month. How is it that we're able to continue to offer our listeners such wonderful music and thoughtful programming? Well, the answer is you. That's right, none of this would be possible without the support of dedicated listeners like you, who can be relied upon to pledge their support time and time again for the content and programming that they enjoy on Catonsville Public Radio. If you haven't already, won't you take a moment to join our family of listener members? Volunteers are standing by to take your call. Days like this are a bit of a tease. An open-ended invitation to put pen to paper and delight in one's imagination. But there is always an unease, a modicum of tension. What, pray tell, will be the next shoe to drop? - Hello? - Ms. Hollingsworth. - Mr. Prattleton. - I regret to inform you that our publishing concern has decided to sever its professional relationship with you. - I understand. - We will be honoring the terms of our original agreement and won't be requesting a return on your initial advance, as we've come to the conclusion that you have indeed made a good faith effort, however hapless, to promote your brand in the public realm. - I thought I was in the business of selling books. - And you were a colossal failure at that as well. I must now bid you a fond farewell, as we are anxiously awaiting the return of all unsold copies of your memoir so that we may promptly haul them to the landfill. Good day. - Well then. - You know, lately I've been thinking a lot about visiting Ikaros at their new location in Greektown. I hear that they're serving up the dishes we love in an inviting new locale with a fresh new spirit. - That campaign really seems to have fulfilled its purpose. - What do you mean? - The management at Ikaros has been saturating the local radio market with that new spot. - Huh. I must have missed it. I just feel like it's time to come back and see them. Like my table is waiting. That's all. It was six years ago. I remember feeling so full of youthful enthusiasm and headstrong optimism, so disciplined and committed to the enterprise, but I feel like I don't know that person anymore. I wouldn't be able to pick her out of a lineup. Sometimes I wonder if it's all in vain and it's all for naught. What is happiness? What's the point? - All day long with these nincompoops. Where's Jonathan? - He took a half day. - A half day? - Yeah. - Does anyone around here ever pause to consider my professional needs? - He left a half hour ago. - Do I have any meeting scheduled for this afternoon? - None that I know of. It's such a wonderful time to be alive. Such a fantastic moment to feel unburdened by anything and everything that holds us back. Perhaps I've simply been confusing nervous excitement with fear all along. They both have a familiar flavor, a similar burn in the pit of my stomach. How long have I subjugated myself to the inane tasks and duties that comprise every day of my life? - Wait a minute. Who are you? - Allow me to introduce myself. Shelby Breadwine, Catonsville Public Radio. - How'd you get in here? - Mr. Prattleton, Joel, if I may. We are in the full thrust of our spring fund-raising drive and I would love to talk to you about all the ways you might be able to support the local public radio that you and I both love and cherish so much. - I could do without those Saturday game shows. - You must be confusing us with another radio outfit. - You know, that one fellow who's always cracking jokes. You know the one. - Mr. Prattleton, as an independent local media concern, we rely upon the kind patronage of such pillars of the community as yourself. Think of all the potential media outreach opportunities for Rosen, Prattleton, Nagel & Suffield. - Well, you certainly do an excellent job of restating the obvious with a maximum of unnecessary hyperbole. What would you suggest? - You could perhaps underwrite our morning drive-time block of light classical music favorites. Or perhaps the second hour of The Petunia Floringbrickle Show. - That second hour of book tour interviews is always a snooze. - Right. - It's coming to me. "When your choice "of brand marketing manager matters the most, "place your trust "in Rosen, Prattleton, "Nagel & Suffield." - It has quite the ring to it. Every human being on this planet sees themselves as the centerpiece of their own heroic struggle, except our combined want exceeds our natural resources and our popular culture. We crave what we can't have and the people who have it don't appreciate their own good fortune. We should all be more thankful for simple everyday victories like sunshine, company and togetherness and that we're not being eaten alive by a hungry grizzly bear. - Hello. Operator? Yes, I'd like the number for a Miss Hollingsworth in Baltimore, Maryland. First name of Priscilla. Edgevale Road. Of course I'll hold. I guess this is it. You guess this is what? - Our last fresh start. - Oh that. It's as if you expect me to be grateful which just leaves me feel all the more dubious about your intentions. - I'll have you know, I'm my own man and I'd like for you and anyone within earshot to truly understand that. - Which is why you dragged me out here on this perfectly lovely weekday morning. - My father is my father but his business is his business. - Which is all fine and dandy, but don't delude yourself for a second into thinking that you are where you are based solely on your own merits and available opportunities. - You hate me for it. - No, I hate you for a variety of otherwise completely valid reasons which I would be happy to discuss with you at a later date and time. But, for now, let's try to focus on the handful of things that distinguish you as the truly special person you really are. - Doing the right thing means making apologies. It's all about mending fences and listening to new ideas. - I always believed that doing the wrong thing was infinitely more interesting and unpredictable. Yet unpredictable endings rarely dovetail with desired outcomes. - Bad choices, wrong turns, boastful and arrogant pride, now that's the stuff of great drama. - The weekend is upon us, ladies! So you know what that means. It's time to come on down to Federal Hill and rock your socks off at The Groove Lounge! And gentlemen, VIP bottle service is back with $250 bottles of Knockov vodka. Think you'll find a cheaper bottle on a Friday night? You won't! So come on down to The Groove Lounge and join all your pals from Baltimore's Best Rock Radio for Ice Cream Social Night! Free mudslide shots for the ladies while supplies last! Valid only one per customer, unwind responsibly. Good? Are you working on a new book? - Good. - It is an expression of a certain "je ne sais quoi," a confrontation of all of the dark places inside of us. Our most indelicate obsessions, things that we hide even from our closest friends and reminisce upon only in the accommodating purr of solitude. - What are you trying to convey to your readers? - Be good. Be kind. Stay weird. Spread love. Because the world is full of people who will want to drag you down, down in the dumps, down where they are. And you've gotta be strong and you need to be bold and you ought to be better than all of it. If your heart's gonna remain on the right path. - Do you think your heart is on the right path? - No one has a perfect heart. And yes, I've lost some of the joyous enthusiasm in the face of blunders and betrayals and missteps. But you have to trudge forward and sally forth. - That's all well and good. And I recognize the potential here. But... it leaves me feeling unsure as to exactly how it's all going to pan out in the end. It sounds highly execution dependent. - Everything in life is execution dependent. And this is no exception! Our inability to express our tangled emotions that lurk inside of us and our flailing attempts to communicate that to our friends and acquaintances, that is the great tragedy of the human experience. - You can color me intrigued. In the meantime, I would like to offer you something of a radical proposal. - Ladies, you took the time to swing into spring fashion, but did you forget to swing into Edgevale Bank to speak to one of our financial advisers about opening a new high-yield money market account? Well, you better get that skinny latte to go and drop into one of our numerous locations right here in Baltimore City! Don't worry, you'll still have plenty of time to go shoe shopping because there just aren't enough hours in the day, am I right, ladies? We've got neighborhood branches in Rosebank, Evergreen, Better Waverly, Pigtown, Beverly Hills and Oakenshawe. See you there. Good? Are we good over here? - See? You're crying right now. What if we were with my family? Or at an important work party? And you're crying right now without any of that pressure. - Well I'm sorry. I'm sorry you can't come to terms with the fact that I am human and I have feelings and it is a component of humanity's goodness that we feel compassion and empathy! - You and your feelings. - Is this right? I'm not sure this is right. - Doesn't feel right. - Perhaps. But who ever said there wasn't such a thing as a free meal in this town? Because, you know? I'm so glad we're here. It's been too long. - You certainly seem quite fired up about it. - I have a lot of fond memories of coming here for Sunday brunch with Aunt Sandy. Those were the days. All the baby octopus you can eat. Isn't that every young man's dream? - Mhmm. - The last memory I can still cling to. - We're constantly creating new memories. Everything we do every day instantly becomes a permanent fixture of the past. - Except I feel like I can't let go of those moments. It's like I can't bear to see them relegated to the ephemera of yesteryear. - History is only an intellectual concept. What matters most is how we live on the memory of others. How we're received. Did we give of ourselves as generously as we could have? Did we allow ourselves to love? Did we pervert selfless love with our own lustful and selfish peculiarities? - The moussaka is to die for if you're are at all on the fence about the souvlaki. - Ladies and gentlemen! Bienvenue, bon appetit, etcetera. It's my pleasure to introduce these two talented artists who will be performing and presumably delighting you here this evening. Won't you please join me in welcoming Lauren Aycock Anderson and Rachel Anne Warren? The little things Discoveries Uncovering insides of things The tracing and tracking The packing and unpacking The waiting and move The little things you do But tell me Are you A good man But tell me Are you A good man He's the angle And you're the worm He got inside and you're lost for words The shoe didn't fit And what of the stick Well, I think that I got the short end of it There are nice people, to name a few, but there's nothing lasting Or lacking of you I am a loner, and I am alone I have a heart that's only halfway grown But tell me Are you A good man But tell me Are you A good man I am the Mississippi And you're running through it I'm a reoccurring dream But you never knew it I'm a decent human being But what do you care I'm a moment in time But you weren't there So, tell me, Are you A good man Tell me Are you A good man So tell me Are you A good man But tell me Are you A good man - Mrs. Woodbourne? - You must be Shelby Breadwine from Catonsville Public Radio. - I most certainly am. - We would recognize that voice just about anywhere. Where are my manors? Please, won't you come in? - You're too generous. - It's nothing in the least. - So then, why don't we start by talking about what Catonsville Public Radio means to you? - I suppose that I like it just fine. - Do you think that you could ever live without your favorite programs on Catonsville Public Radio? Or our exquisitely curated selection of light classical music favorites? - You know what people say. Life goes on in spite of such things. - But Mrs. Woodbourne-- - Oh, Esther. Please call me Esther. - Are you saying that life would march merrily along without your local public radio on your broadcast dial? - Well, Braden would be sorely disappointed. I can be sure of that. - Braden? Who's Braden? - Oh, Braden. My darling son. He couldn't live without Catonsville Public Radio. Truth be told, you're his favorite. He's listening in the living room right now. Why don't you go and introduce yourself to him? - Braden? Braden? Would you like to share a moment and talk about what local public radio means to you? Sacre bleu. God dammit. So, what have we learned here? - I would argue that the lesson is that no good deed goes unpunished. - I know that caution and reflection are not the principal attributes most likely to come to mind when reflecting upon your life and your accomplishments. But it stands to reason these two traits might serve to inform and guide you in the future as you seek to chart a professional path for yourself. - I do feel somewhat more heartened about the viability of the process. But I also certainly feel like my mastery of that process is a whole lot more tenuous than I previously imagined. - I'm Shelby Breadwine and you're tuned to Catonsville Public Radio. Thanks to thoughtful listener members like you, our latest fundraising campaign is coming to a successful finish. If you have yet to make a pledge yourself, there's still plenty of time for you to decide what level of support is right for you. Five dollars a day? 25 dollars a month? Well, at either of those membership levels, you can look forward to a snazzy Catonsville Public Radio luggage tag in your mailbox. So please don't hesitate to call now and pledge your support for the local public radio that you love. Looks like it's time for your final traffic report this morning. Ralph, are you there? Can you hear me? - Shelby! I read you loud and clear. This morning's traffic report is brought to you by B, A Bolton Hill Bistro. Outer Loop, you're gonna be coasting from Hammonds Ferry Road on up to the Key Bridge with nary a delay in sight. So it's lots of good news for all of you motorists out there braving the Beltway this morning. I'm Ralph Kirk for Catonsville Public Radio. - I've been thinking. - Do tell. - We didn't do it right. - Oh, woe is you. - I just sort of made the blind assumption that everything would end up working itself out as long as I had a capable team in place. - Well, who's crying now? - I think I'm being held to unrealistic standards for achievement. - I think you're being too hard on yourself. - We just didn't know any better. - I think you did the best that you could have possibly done under most if not all circumstances. So there. - Sorry I'm late. Northbound traffic on Charles Street was backed up all the way to Fayette Street. - Take a seat, Ralph. - This is fancy. What's the occasion? - Ralph, you've been a valuable part of the Catonsville Public Radio family for so long and we are all so grateful for your many years of service to the operation. But it is my sad duty to inform you we've fallen short on our spring fundraising campaign goals. As a result, everyone at the station is now forced to reconsider how we can best allocate our available resources. - What are you getting at? - Ralph, I mean, let's face it, most of the time you aren't even looking at a live traffic report or even reading updates or bulletins from state or local agencies! - It's the same goddamned traffic every goddamned morning. - And don't insult my intelligence by pretending that I haven't caught the smell of rotgut on your breath leaving the station on more than a handful of occasions. - Who the hell cares? - I don't know what to tell you. If you can't control the message, you can't control anything. That's exactly it. I can't help you control the message if you can't tell me what the message is in the first place. And this is valuable time that we're idly wasting. Their subjective judgment is not a proxy for your reality. You want Better Homes and Gardens? I'll get you Better Homes and Gardens! But if you can't learn how to control the message then you're never going to learn how to crush the deal. This is getting us nowhere, Lily. Give my secretary a ring and we'll find a way to hash all of this out. Kisses. - Whoa! Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me?! Do you know what this is? Do you care what this is? This is a share row. As in, share the fucking road! Three feet! You blind-ass motherfucker! - These cyclists are such a pain in the ass. Who's going to come along and give us motorists a fair shake? - Hey Kelly. - Hey. - I'm just wondering. Is the internet acting funny around here? - Seems to be working fine for me. - It won't let me check into my flight to Denver tomorrow for whatever reason. - Aw. - It's the damnedest thing. - I know. - Well, I'll be sure to keep you posted on that. - Sounds like a plan to me! - All right. - Dad. - I appreciate you finding the time to come and visit in person despite your myriad daily personal and professional obligations. - You know that I always cherish the time we're afforded together. - Son, it's all over. The dream has dimmed and the sun has set on our carefree world of luxury. - What are you talking about? - That awful woman and her horrible book have destroyed my beloved publishing company. Although you seem to be taking great joy in her flimsy company as of late. - I don't understand exactly what it is that you're alluding to. - I plan to resign as chairman effective immediately as we file for bankruptcy and move forward with auctioning off our catalog and liquidating our assets. That is what I am alluding to. - But if you're resigning as chairman and the-- - Allow me to dispel your romantic ideal of the way things ought to be. You've disappointed all of us with your obstinate laissez-faire refusal to mature and make the most of yourself. You've had plenty of opportunities to remedy this disappointment and so far your only response has been to thumb your nose at all of us in contemptuous ambivalence. Put simply, you didn't do it right. I'm sorry that I had to be the one to break the news to you. - I suppose it softens the sting a little bit. - You received some supportive comments. Some constructive criticism along the way. - I tried my best. - Except you failed to devote your utmost energy and enthusiasm to the enterprise - I possess the conviction and the will to succeed. - Without personal sacrifice and the commitment of all of your available resources to the endeavor, that simply registers as vain posturing on your behalf. You have elevated yourself to an enviable position of autonomy and authority at Rosen, Prattleton, Nagel & Suffield. Those are hardly the trappings of tragedy. - I detest my job! And I despise everyone who works there. And I refuse to accept that I must be forced to toil with such rabble on account of your obtuse philosophical musings! I deserve nothing less than the reins of our family dynasty! - You have proven yourself incapable of realizing any of your languid goals or shepherding anything to a successfully implemented conclusion, therefore, you deserve nothing. On the brighter side of things, I would imagine that you'll be all the more prepared for next time. - Next time? There's a next time? - There will always be a next time. Did you honestly expect me to leave you forever in the lurch? You're far too fragile of a flower for me to leave untended in this unforgiving world. So, as I said, I'm sure you'll do better next time and perhaps next time you'll do it right. - Natalya! Natalya. Do you remember when I told you that there was bluster and then there was honesty? Vaguely. - I'm thinking we're all capable of bluster when it comes to pursuing a goal or advocating a position. That necessarily make us terrible people or inherently dishonest, but it stands to reason that bluster might not be such a terrible thing after all. In fact, bluster might be part and parcel of ambition, initiative and success. - Sure, why not? - I'm saying this because I'm thinking that this is the end. That this is it, right here. - The end of what? - Of everything. - Oh. Right. - How do you think it comes to pass? - I'm sorry? - The end? Do you think it's just a quick flick of a switch and then we're gone, or is it some kind of gradual deflation of ourselves into an unknown emptiness? - It would be presumptuous of me to even suggest that any one scenario is more plausible than an infinite amount of competing alternatives. - I only wish that I'd learn to accept the fact that I'm not going to be around once I'm gone. Just when I was in the grip of a newfound togetherness! - So I guess I did it again. No surprises there. I would appear to be incapable of learning from past mistakes because I have a habit of repeating them over and over, again and again. - I happen to think we had a lot of fun together last night. I happen to enjoy your company and I look forward to the time that we spend together. - All male sexuality is violence. I truly wish I was one of those people who is tolerant and reasonable and accept things even if they weren't the way they're supposed to be, but I'm not. I deserve better and I refuse to compromise my standards. - Every relationship we have in life requires some degree of compromise. - What do you want from me? - Well, maybe you should just be left to your own miserable lot in life. - Wouldn't that be a delight.
