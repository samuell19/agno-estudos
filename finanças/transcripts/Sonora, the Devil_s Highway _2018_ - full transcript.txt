NETFLIX PRESENTS The USA is gripped by a crisis caused by the Great Depression in 1929. The US government orders mass deportations of Mexicans and closes the border. Nationalism spreads to Mexico, and in Sonora, it leads to the expulsion of the Chinese who had arrived during the Porfiriato. SONORA-ARIZONA BORDER No Mexican cars or Mexican citizens are allowed through. This is crazy. We've never seen anything like this. - Aarón, good afternoon. - What's going on, Paco? President Hoover has closed the border. He's prohibited all foreign vehicles from using US roads. May I take your documents? I have to register your vehicle. - Thank you. - This can't be happening. That's the best route to make money. What are we going to do? The next installment's due in a week. To hell with the gringos. We'll drive people across the desert. Aarón, there are no roads on this side. So, we can charge even more. It's the law of supply and demand. Are you insane? I've done that trip twice in Rivera's Ford. There was less pressure when you only rented the car. If you rent, you're an employee, but if you're the owner, you're a businessman. No cars or Mexican citizens... There you are. Welcome to Mexico. Go ahead. You can't come through. What we're doing is for the well-being of our families. Think about the future of our children and our grandchildren. Those Green Guards are awful. When can we live in peace? They can go back to their country. Mexico for Mexicans. As I said, a lot of people will want to flee from Sonora. And most of them will be Chinese. Hello, Daddy. Anita, I think your mom needs help. Mommy, can I help? Yes, my love. Go gather those plates for me. Go ahead. Due to health violations, this restaurant is closed. - Everyone out! Come on! - Daddy, they're here! - Drop the weapon. - It's not a weapon. - Tie them up! - No, she's my daughter! A flagrant violation of Law 31. Bring her out, along with this yellow nobody. You have no right! The president, Governor Calles, and the true Mexican people have given us this mission. It's the law. - Let's go! - Mommy! Let go of my daughter! - Where are you taking my husband? - Come see. I have to go, Father. But how will you get there, Rosario? Arizona is closed. I heard there are cars that drive people across the desert. It's too dangerous. That's the old missionary route. There's a reason they call it the Devil's Highway. I have no choice, Father. I can't leave those children on their own. Be careful, Rosario. Throw the Chinese out! These yellow dogs have been declared a threat to public health. Ninety-five percent of them are carriers of syphilis... Disgusting Chinese! ...tuberculosis, beriberi, leprosy. It's a national necessity. The duty of any Mexican who yearns for the greatness of their race and country. Daddy! Hunger and shamelessness have driven our women into the arms of Chinese men. How are you, Marquitos? Good afternoon, Sheriff. Gentlemen. Have they closed the mines in Arizona too? No, but they're throwing out all the Mexicans. Damn it. Sheriff, do you know if my uncle still lives around here? Emeterio? He's probably not even aware of it, but he is still here. And still drunk. Okay. Well, instead of giving him a drink, why don't you help him? Only the Papago spirits themselves can help him now, Marquitos. Hello? Sheriff? Sheriff? - What about Serafina? - I have her here. Hermosillo. Leaving in 20 minutes. - Leaving in 15 minutes for Cananea. - Hermosillo. - Cananea. - Guaymas, this afternoon. - To Hermosillo. - Cananea. LUXURY TRIPS MEXICALI I hope the birds don't shit on it. - You love that car too much. - Ah, but it's only a Chrysler. You, my love, are a Cadillac. Poets compare their women to flowers. Because they can't afford cars. This is disgusting. A businessman who thinks he'll get rich in the desert. I don't know why you want to go to Mexicali. Everybody's going to Cananea or Guaymas. We'll get passengers, Alma. Just wait. - Is this going to Mexicali? - That's what it says there. - Good morning. - Good morning. There's nobody here. To Mexicali? Look. I think we have some customers. See? What did I tell you? Those must be some desperate people. Good morning. - Mexicali? - Yes. - Yes. - Me, too. Let's go. MY STRUGGLE ADOLF HITLER The road ends in Sonoyta. We'll stop there for gas and water. No more than 20 minutes. There are bathrooms there as well. Then we continue to Mexicali for another 200 kilometers. Which route? I can read the desert like a book. I've crossed it many times. - What's the matter? - My stomach. - Are you alright? - What happened? It's because we ate in that terrible restaurant. How was I supposed to know the Chinese place had been shut down? They poisoned him? - They poisoned him. - Sir, please. I know what the Chinese are like. Somebody help us, please. We need a doctor. Help! We need a doctor! - What's the matter, ma'am? - We need a doctor. My husband is sick. - Calm down. - We need a doctor! - What's wrong? - It feels like knives in my gut. - We need to take him to Lao Chan. - Is he Chinese? Yes, sir, but he's our only doctor. I'm here. - Stay calm. - What is it? It's your appendix. It needs to be removed immediately. - Now? - I can do it. He'll have to stay here for a week to recover. - Fuck. - You're going to be all right. Chew on this. But don't swallow it. I bet that's opium. I hope so. There's nothing better for pain. They even brought their drugs here. One day they'll ruin the entire continent. When are we leaving? Your driver needs surgery, and it'll take a week for him to recover. We paid a lot of money to get to Mexicali today. I'm sorry, but you will have to wait. I'll give you your money back. - And leave us here? - No, we had an agreement. We paid money, didn't we? I have to get to my grandchildren. They're all alone. My brother's waiting for me. I have official business in Baja California. - I need to leave right now. - All right then, can you drive? No, a Norteño is a horseman. Those machines-- - You, can you drive? - Only gringos and the rich have cars. - Then you'll have to wait. - She can drive. No. I have to stay with my husband. Are you a doctor? What can you do for him? Besides, you'll need money to pay the Chinese guy, who's bound to charge like a Jew. If you get us there when you promised, this is yours. Alma! - I don't know the way. - Alma, come here! Not even with a map. I know someone who knows the way. But it'll cost you. And who is this master of the desert, Marquitos? Relax, uncle. It's me. Marcos? Some people need guiding across the desert. It's too dangerous. This is the hottest time of the year. That's why they're paying so much. Listen to me. I can't do it. I'm no good for that anymore. No one remembers a time when you were any good, uncle. Go ahead, get drunk. Give up on everything and everyone. We need the money. You have to take them. No. My duty is to be with you. Your duty is to take my place. I'll be fine. - Yes. - I'll be fine. See that red mountain? Yes. Head straight towards it and then to its left, please. Yes. You have a beautiful voice. It's my husband's favorite song. When we're driving for hours, I sing to him. He says when he's with me, he doesn't need a radio. Did you know those mountains are in the United States? I've spent lots of time there. What's it like? The work is hard, but they pay much better. It's very modern. They just built the tallest building in the world. The Empire State. And there's a lot of music. Have you ever heard jazz? I don't think so. It seems you have a problem with the Chinese. Not at all, but they should go back to their country. Not only are they lazy and filthy, but they've taken all our jobs. If they're lazy, why would they want our jobs? Are you sure we'll be all right in Mexicali? Yes. Baja is at peace. There has to be another way to get there. Only by air. I'm hot. So are we, precious one, but we have to put up with it. We'll be there soon, and you'll see your cousins. - It would be better to travel at night. - If we had headlights. Do you regret marrying me? Never. We are all children of God. - Are you a Cristera? - I'm a good Catholic. What? Do you have problems with Catholics, too? Religion will have its place, although reduced, in this new Mexico. But the yellow invasion, that could mean the end of our civilization. Many of them have been citizens since the time of Don Porfirio. That asshole. All he cared about was drinking French wine and making his friends richer. If he had stayed in power, we would be driving to Mexicali on a road. Yes, paved with the bones of the men who built it. Did you fight in the revolution? I was a cavalry officer in Pancho Villa's army. What's going on? We can't make it up the hill. You'll have to get out and push. On the count of three, everyone push, and Miss Alma will hit the gas. I'm not pushing. I already paid extra for those two. So the working class can push. I've paid to travel. You should be ashamed. Come on, Doña Rosario. Let me help you. Doña Rosario, Miss. Walk to one side. The car might kick up some rocks. Her name is Pilar, uncle. Okay, Miss Alma. Harder, uncle. Uncle! Are you alright? What's the matter? I need a drink. No, you don't. You'd pass out. Come on, let's go. Slow down! What happened to them? - Help! Please! - Over here! Please! Thank god you found us. We've been here for hours. - Where are you going? - To Mexicali. It won't start in this heat. It's a miracle you made it this far. The engine is broken, the battery is dead, and the oil pump is leaking. What would an Indian know about cars? My uncle was a mechanic in the mines of Arizona. He can fix anything. Enough chatter. We have to keep going. We can't go back. You should have thought of that before you married this. We can't leave them in the desert. There's plenty of room. I'll ride on the running board with my uncle and the gentleman, and the lady and the girl can squeeze inside. - These people didn't pay. - We have money. - What's your name? - Lee Wong. Wong. All those in favor of the Wong family riding with us, raise their hand. Just keep them away from me. Let's go. Thank you. It's okay. We'll be alright. I wet myself when I saw that man. Don't worry. I'll protect you and Mommy. He's the man that hit you and threw water at you. He's just an angry man, who's more scared than us. Do you understand? Yes. They take away your home just like that? It all started during the revolution. That was the will of the Mexican people, as is this crusade. It has nothing to do with my will nor the will of most people. During the revolution, ma'am. Did you fight in the revolution? Well, not in the sense of bearing arms or in the trenches. There are other ways to serve. Ways to serve yourself. A revolution is much more than a battlefield. Yes, a lot of people believe that bullshit, and when the smoke clears, the real heroes suddenly appear, sitting behind their huge desks without a scratch on them. There's something up ahead. Now what? It's a massacre. Someone was in too much of a hurry. The police must have caught up with them. I found some survivors. Two people climbed up there. And two others came down from over there. This is worth a fortune. We can make some space for these, right? - Eme. - What? I need you to be alert. This man. What are you doing with that? - Taking them with us. - There's no space. If the Chinese can fit, so can the liquor. How are we going to fit in here now? I just wanted to smell it to know what kind of bootleggers we're dealing with. Let's move, goddamn it! Let's go! It's alright. Five fingers. One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine, ten. She only has eight fingers. How did you end up marrying Mr. Wong? Well... My father was killed in the revolution and we were left with nothing. Lee's family lived nearby. They had a butcher shop and always gave us whatever they had left. That's how I met him. He's a very good man. Spreading diseases. Chinese diseases that this country didn't have before. - Don't cry. - A yellow plague. Hug Serafina. How long until we get there? Slow down. What is he doing? Uncle. Those are the same tracks we saw by the truck. They've been walking in circles. Hey! Get back here! This one is a gringo. The bootleggers. We should leave them here. Is there a town near here? No. Just desert. What are you doing here? We're guiding some travelers. You have a car? If you can stand up, we have water. Who the hell are these two? They were nearly dead. So let them die. Are we picking up every piece of garbage we find on the way? That's not very friendly, brother. Make no mistake, you're not my brother. Yuma Joe, at your service. - He's Tony. - If you don't pay, you don't ride with us. - We have money, my friend. - I'm not your friend. Fucking Pocho. It'll be dark soon. - We have to get going. - No. We'll camp here for the night. Does the car not have headlights? I can't see very well at night. Fucking hell. The ladies can sleep in the car. Chinese on the run, lost gringos, blind Indians. What a nightmare. The Chinese eat cats and dogs. We had to leave our cat at home. Maybe your father ate it. The man is just joking, sweetheart. I'm telling the truth. He isn't, is he, Daddy? He's lying. Are you calling me a liar? You don't know anything about the Chinese. That's why you're afraid of us. Stay out of it. Who's afraid of who, animal? Can't you act like a civilized adult? You forget you don't have your gang with you. These people don't know how to fight. Only how to stab you in the back. But they don't know how to fight. - Fight! - Lee! Daddy! Stop it, gentlemen! Stop it! Stay still, fucking Chinese! I'll break your neck, fucking Chinese! Sit up. I'll try to get them out. Stop whimpering. Put the fire out when they're all done eating. I need some space. This is the last picture they sent me. They must be four and six. Little angels. Aarón and I have tried everything, but we haven't been blessed with children. You're very fortunate. No, I'm too old to take care of two little children. I'm sure you'll be a wonderful mother. I was a disastrous mother to Yasmine. She ran away with a nobody. Even darker-skinned than our guide. She was only 15. I told her to leave. I kicked her out and never saw her again. I only knew about her life from letters. And the father? He left her. She got meningitis. Now I'll never see her again. Why do you want to go to the United States? I'm alone. My parents died. My brother is all I have. You'll like it there. There aren't as many rules to follow. There's more freedom. You must have a woman there. I have nothing. I'm alone, too. I'd better go to the car. We belong here. We are the Desert People. This is I'itoi, the Man in the Maze. We exist to sing and to dance. Why do we do these things, Emeterio? We sing and dance the way I'itoi taught us in order to bring the rains and preserve the land. I'itoi. Give me strength. We're not going to Arizona, we're going to Mexicali. - You can cross there. - Then what did I pay you for? The border is that way. If you want to take your chances, I'll gladly give you your money back. These fucking gringos will only slow us down. Let's go! Stop. Stop. Now what? This is an old pass. We need to move these rocks. What? I'm injured. You saw me. All I saw was you getting what you deserved. How far to the border? Maybe two days. If the car doesn't break down. What? Do you want a drink, my friend? It's yours, after all. Well, your mom liked it. - Eme. - No. - I need a drink. - No, you don't. Look at me. Look at this. Give it to me. Calm down. So, Don Emeterio is your uncle? - My mother was O'odham. - Papagos. Or as the Apaches would say, beaner Indians. Tohono O'odham. Desert People. All this land was ours long before the gringos and the Mexicans divided it up. Then we already have something in common. My family is from Yuma, Arizona. They were among the first there, centuries ago. So you were born in the United States. When I was born Arizona was still a territory. Eme worked in the mines in Bisbee. You never went with him? Me? No. I think we Mexicans should stay in Mexico. He's been dead a couple of days. He came from over there. There might be someone else left. Surely they'd be dead by now, uncle. What if they're not? What if his family is in a car that broke down? Only if they're protected from the sun and have water. I'll go see. You're not going anywhere. I paid for a ride to Mexicali, not to be stopping and picking up every idiot who got lost in the desert. You, come with me. Come with me! If you think I'm going to let you-- At least leave us some water. Let's go. Let's go! They took Serafina! We'll get her back. What do we do now? With only one man to push the car, they won't get past the dunes. I'm scared of getting lost without Emeterio. That drunken Indian is full of shit. Just keep heading west. I think we're going east. It's hard to tell when the sun is so high. You don't have a compass? Mommy, listen to the noise these rocks make. They're singing pebbles. The new Serafina is almost ready. I want to put her hair on. Go on then. Come on, look. I'll see what's going on over there. I'm burning up. The wound is already infected. What do we do, uncle? We have to cut out the bullet. - Don't move. - Have you done it before? Not for a long time. Make him drink this. How much did you drink? It steadies my hand. And clouds your mind, uncle. Here, drink it down. Hold him down, so he doesn't move. I'll do it. No. May I have your hairpin, please? Don't let him touch me. He's going to kill me! I've spent my whole life cutting up cows, sheep and pigs. A Norteño can't be much more complicated. No. Stay still. Here it is. Ma'am, wet those herbs and crush them. Press them onto the wound. Press down hard. Harder. Push down. Push down. That will draw out the infection. Don't brake. Why are you stopping? That hill. Go on, fast! Faster. We can make it if we go faster. - If you say so. - Come on. Come on. Faster! - Come on! - I can't go any faster! Faster. Come on. What happened? It overheated. What do we do? How do we fix it? Wait for it to cool down and then put more water in. How long will it take? Until the water stops boiling. Damn it. Are we stopping? No. Let's go as far as we can. Without a car, we're going to die out here. How did I end up here? I don't know how I ended up here. You hear that? No. What? Stay in the car. And stay quiet. Fucking Indian piece of shit. No! Get off him. Leave him alone. Did he hurt you, ma'am? No, I'm fine, but the car won't start. The water hose is broken. Fucking gringo piece of shit. You understand? You were supposed to wait for us. How is everyone? We're not well. Okay, Miss Alma, try it now. Thank you, Emeterio. Good luck to you! - No! - Let's go! No! - Step on it! - No! - No. - Are you all right? Are we going to follow them? No. We're going to rest further ahead. These people need to rest. What should we do with him? Wait for him to fall asleep and crush his skull with a rock. Or if we're lucky, he'll walk off on his own. He'll get lost. He's been lost for a long time. He says you have the most beautiful ass he's ever seen. He wants to marry you and build you a palace. I hope you both die. Dig that up. When I was a kid, we'd wait for the cactus fruits to ripen and then the women would harvest them with long poles, and we'd put them in baskets so they would ferment and become wine. Then we sang and danced, and that made it rain in the desert. Once a year. The men and women would lie in the sand and fall asleep. The young would come together and make love. That's where I met my wife-who-is-gone. The years I was with her, my heart was light. I felt like it might float up out of my chest. Then the Mexicans came and we started working for them. We started to dress like them and learn their ways. And they taught us to drink. We could drink whenever we wanted to. If they chew this, it will help. I never met her. My wife-who-is-gone died of cholera, while I was working in Arizona. Alma... You have to help me. I'm Pilar. You saw my grandchildren. In the photo, yes. This is Juan Ignacio, and his little sister is María del Carmen. You and your husband... - You have a business. - I'm Pilar. You have a good marriage. Maybe this is God's plan. We're going to live... in a place where the people... are not angry or sick. Anita! Anita! Hello. Wait here. The dead man we found. He must have come in a car. That's true. You're right. It's too far, uncle. We have no choice. We'll never make it on foot. We're going to look for help. - I'm coming with you. - No, we won't be long. Please. I'll go with him. - Daddy! - Anita, come here. Daddy's going to get help. Come here. Stop accelerating. Stop accelerating. You'll have to push. Fine, but you'll do what I tell you. Emeterio, not so fast! Eme! "The result of the mixing of races always degrades the superior race. It is a physical and intellectual degeneration that moves slowly until it becomes a progressive disease. The great cultures of the past perished because the original race they descended from died out from contaminated blood." That's enough! Stop! Look at me. Look me in the eyes. Look at me. All this is your fault. You and your stupid ideas. Your idiotic racism. Mommy. My husband... is a much better Mexican than you. That man is full of poison. Accelerate! What is it? Can I have some water? But drink it slowly. I can wait, Anita. Doña Rosario. Hey! Not so fast! Stop accelerating! Stop! Just my fucking luck to be stuck with this idiot. An idiot who thinks he's the boss, but he's just a dickhead with a gun. Go ahead. Fucking imbecile. Back to the dead. Go! Smugglers. They think gasoline is all they need to get across the desert. Do you think you can move the body? She thinks I'm Alma. She wants me to adopt her grandchildren. She can tell that you have a good heart. They killed us. Like rats in a trap. They had got there first. They got to Celaya first. They cornered us with barbed wire fences. And we went straight into their trap. It was a killing machine, and they were killing us. And General Villa said, "Attack!" We were whipping our horses until they bled, and they were killing us. They killed our comrades and made us bury them. And now they say... that we're bandits. We're just bandits. Bandits! I'm a cavalry officer. Stupid fucking gringos. Stupid fucking gringos. The black wind. Just what I need. Lord, if you could hold off just a while, I'd be very grateful. Get in. How long will it last? Depends how angry he is. Who? I'itoi. He watches us, and every now and then, he can't hold in his anger. Aarón. My love. You commit... one foolish act in life... and must live... with the consequences. May God forgive... all our hatred. Yasmine. María! Daddy, Doña Rosario died. How are you, uncle? We have to go. There's not much gasoline left. And Alma? The car? Let's go. The gringos are dead. And Miss Alma left with the car. Start! Start. We're out of gas. Start! Don't leave us stranded! Lee. My darling girl, come here. That's the car. It's her. Help your girlfriend. Let's go. Quickly! I'm here. Over here! I'm here. Over here! I'm here. - Are you alone? - No. The others are behind me. There's no gasoline left. Pilar. I was so worried about you. And Doña Rosario? She's dead. She told me to give you... this. What else did she say? The address is written on the back. Serafina. That's right. Drink it all. I should have left you in Sonoyta to drink yourself to death, uncle. Bring the other bottles. - Good afternoon. - Hello. I have some friends. - The desert has been very hard on them. - Alright. How far is it to San Luis Rio Colorado? Go see for yourself. Behind the hills. The girl. The girl first, please. Thank you. Pilar. Pilar, water. The anti-Chinese campaigns were banned in 1934 by President Lázaro Cárdenas. In 1958 the Mexicali-Sonoyta road was opened, crossing the Gran Desierto de Altar and El Pinacate.
