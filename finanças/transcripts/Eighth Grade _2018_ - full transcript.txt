Subtitles by explosiveskull Edited, ReSynced, Colored by Klaff2004 [BEEPING] Hey, guys! Uh, it's Kayla. Back with another video. Okay, um, so first thing's first is, um... I haven't been getting, like, a lot of views or whatever on my videos, so if you guys could share, like with your friends and stuff, I would really, really appreciate it. Uh, okay, so the topic of today's video is "being yourself," and it's like, you know, well, aren't I always being myself? And like, yeah. For sure. Um, but, uh... Sorry, I... sorry, I'm... I'm reading these off paper. Um, okay... But it's like, being yourself is, like, not changing yourself to impress someone else... You know, because, like, um, like, uh, you could be the most popular kid at school or, like, you know, like, um, have, like, the hottest boyfriend or whatever, um, but, like, what's the point if you're not being yourself? And it's like being yourself can be hard. And, like, the hard part about being yourself is that it's not always easy because, you know, like, people can, like, um, like, make fun of you, or something dumb. Because, like, people suck and evil people exist. Um, but you just got to ignore them and, like, not care what they're saying. Um... And... Like, for instance, like... You know, a lot of people, like, call me quiet or shy or whatever, um, but I'm not quiet, like, I... you know, I don't talk a lot at school, but, um, I just... it's not like I'm scared to not talk, I just don't want to. But if, like, people actually, you know, like, be my friend, like, you know, talk to me and stuff, they'd find out that I'm, like, really funny and cool and talkative. And, yeah, I'm just... I'm not, like, quiet. I just choose not to talk a lot at school, like other people, you know? Um... [CLICKS TONGUE] Okay, so, yeah, uh... I hope that... basically, you know, like, be yourself and don't care about, like, whatever... What other people think about you. And just, like, you know, ignore them if they're being mean to you about it. And everything will work out if you're just being yourself. Uh, okay. uh... thank you, guys, for watching this video. I hope some of you guys found it helpful. Um, and make sure to subscribe to my channel. Bleh. Um, and, yeah. Thank you for watching. Gucci.

I can't believe you're gonna be in high school. - Mmm-hmm. - How did that happen? I don't know. You excited? Yes. [IMITATES KAYLA] Yes. Yes, I'm very excited. I'm so excited. [CHUCKLES] - Hey, I got an... email from Mrs. Graves. - Huh? [SCOFFS] I got an email from Mrs. Graves that said you're going to go to Kennedy's birthday thing tomorrow? No. - Really? - Yeah, no. - It sounded kinda fun. - Kennedy doesn't like me. - That can't be true. - Cool. Sometimes kids act like they don't like you, but it's really just 'cause they got their own stuff going on, and they don't... Kayla. Kayla... - Are you kidding me right now? - [LAUGHS] - I'm just being funny. - Dad, no! It's not funny! You're the only one that thinks it's funny! [CRYING] You don't think I'm funny? - Dad! - [SNIFFLES] Dad, it's a Friday. You said I could do whatever I want on Fridays. - And right now... - Okay, you're right. Okay, I did. All right. Can I say one thing, though? Then you can go back to your phone, I'll leave you alone. - I just want to say one thing. - Fine! Okay, but you have to let me finish saying it. - Yeah, I will. I'm not even... - You can't get angry before I finish saying it, otherwise you won't listen. - Fine. Just say it. - All right. All right. Okay. Okay. - Are you gonna say it? - I'm thinking. [MARK SCOFFS] I think you're so cool. I think you're so... - I'm gonna stop eating with you if you... - Hey, I said... you said I could say one thing. - Can I say one thing, please? - [SIGHS] - Fine. - Thank you. Look, when I as your age, I was not cool like you. You have all these interests and... and your videos and, just, how you... express yourself in them, it's so... it's just so cool. It's so great, - and I just... I just think... - [SIGHS] Maybe you just need - to put yourself out there a little bit more. - Please stop. - I know the kids at school are not great. - Dad, that's... I'm not saying you have to be best friends with Kennedy Graves. And I know this is gonna sound lame, but I just think you're a really special person. - Dad... - And I know it's like, you know, all dads think that, I... But even if I wasn't your dad, I would still think that. - I would. I'm sorry. - Dad! - I'm sorry. I would. - Dad! Dad! This is more than one thing. - It's... it's a chunk of things... - [GROANS] ...and I know it's like, "Dad, shut up. Duh, shut up". I get it. Please, I get it. But I'm actually not saying this to make you feel bad. - I'm saying it to make you feel better. - You know what'd make me feel better? - What? - Is if you'd let me go on my phone. - Okay, fine. Go ahead. Do your thing. - Thanks. [SIGHS] [POP MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES] [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] Uh... I'm just going to bed. Okay. MARK: Okay. - Good night. - Good night. Are you... - Are you mad at me? - No, I just... - Next time, can you please knock? - Yeah, sure. Sorry. I did... KAYLA: Well, uh... Do it louder or something. I don't know. For sure. Yeah. Got it. Sorry. Good night. Good night. [DOOR CLOSES] [KAYLA SIGHS] Please... Shit. Shit! [BEEPING] Hey, guys. Kayla back here with another video. Uh, okay, so the topic of today's video is "Putting Yourself Out There." Um, okay. So, like, what does that mean? Where is "there"? Well, "there" can be anywhere that you wouldn't usually go. You know, maybe because it's, like, weird or scary or, um, something like that. Um, okay, and now you're probably thinking, like, you know, well, "Why would I want to go somewhere like that?" And, uh... there's actually lots of reasons. Uh, one reason is that... people might not know, like, the real you. Like, if you only ever see, you know, some people at school or something, then those people are only going to know the school you. But if you put yourself out there and you go to places you wouldn't usually go, people can know the movie you or the pool you or the party you or the weekend you. All the yous that make up the real you. Like, for example, this one time I was having a bunch of friends over, and my dad made me invite this uh... one weird girl, or whatever, and, you know, I didn't really want to invite her because, um... at school she was just always weird, so I didn't like her. But my dad made me invite her, so then she came over, and I got to know the real her. And she actually was really cool and funny. - [GASPS] Kayla! - And, like, just awesome. And all my friends were just, like, "Who is she?" And everyone was just, like, talking about her the whole time. [INAUDIBLE] So, yeah. And... Yeah, I guess that's basically what I was trying to say, like, you know, you just need to put yourself out there and, like, face your fears and, you know, let people know the real you. And, like, it doesn't matter if you're scared because everyone's gonna be scared. Uh... okay, uh, hope... bleh.

Gather round, over there by the diving board. She said all the girls over there. - Oh, yeah. Right. - Yeah. No boys allowed. DIANNE: All right. Yes, okay. Let's all get in together. Great. Okay. Uh... wait. Kayla, I can't see you, sweetie. Come up front. There you go. - Okay. And cheese! - ALL: Cheese!

STEPH: It'll look so good on you. KENNEDY: I know. I love it. [GIRLS LAUGH] DIANNE: And this one's from Kayla. She's right over there. [CAMERA CLICKS] What is it? Uh, it's a card game. Um... It's actually really fun. Like, everyone gets ten cards and you take turns, like... - Uh, it's like Go Fish, except a lot more fun. - Okay. This one's from Julia. - MIKE: Happy birthday to you. - DIANNE: No, Mike! - KENNEDY: Oh, my God. No, no! - DIANNE: Mike! Come on, Mike... - MIKE: Happy... what? What? - KENNEDY: It's not time yet. No! MIKE: It's time. I brought it down from the kitchen. I got it all over my shirt. - It's time to eat! What? - DIANNE: Mike. - KENNEDY: Oh, my God! - MIKE: I picked this thing up at 8:00 in the goddamn morning! Eat it! KENNEDY: Oh, my God. - [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] - KAYLA: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Dad, can you please just come get me? No, the party's... party's over. I don't know how it ended, Dad, okay? It's just kind of, like, over. And a lot... My God. Dad, I'm the last one here, okay? Can you please just come get me? - MARK: Are you whispering? - No, I'm not whispering. It's just really bad reception here. Okay, listen, I can get there... Just come get me, please. - All right. In an hour. - Can you please come quicker? I'll try... Fine. Whatever. Fine. Just text me when you're here and don't come inside. Okay. Are you okay? Is everything all right? All right. Yeah. - You sure? - Thanks. - What? - Thanks, I said. - Okay, I love you. - All right. Bye. - Love you too. - Kayla, is everything... [SIGHS] [CHATTERING CONTINUES] Ow. AIDEN: Oh, sorry. No. I just gotta... What? Was just grabbing my phone. Had to charge it. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Sometimes I charge it, too. My phone. I... Yeah, sometimes my phone runs out of batteries, too. - You know, everyone's in there. - Oh, that's where everyone is. Okay. Uh... I'll go out there in a second. Okay. [BEEPING] Hey, guys. It's Kayla, back here with another video. Okay, so the topic of today's video, which is super cool, is, "How To Be Confident." - [KIDS LAUGHING] - GIRL: Ow. KAYLA: [ON VIDEO] So, um... I think one thing a lot of people think about confidence is that, like, you know, you're born with it. You either are confident or you're not. You know, just like how some people are tall. You're either tall or short, but... ...it's not like that, actually. Confidence is a choice. [ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] Like, the really awesome thing about confidence is that you can just start acting like it, even if you feel like you don't have any. For example, I used to, like, not be confident at all. But then one day, I'm like, "Hmm, I want to be confident". So, then I just kind of started acting like it, and then it made me feel good, and then I actually started being confident, like, without trying. And, like, a big part of being confident is being brave, and you can't be brave unless you're scared. So, for those of you who are feeling scared about being confident, that's actually a big part of confidence, to be scared. - That's normal. - [SINGING INAUDIBLY] Because you can't be brave without being scared. So, go out there and just be, like, confident. And if you don't feel confident, just do it anyways. Make yourself confident. Uh, okay, so as always, uh... please, uh... share and subscribe to my channel if you guys liked the video, and thanks for watching. Gucci. KAYLA: Oh, hey. Oh, hey. What's your name again? Oh, yeah. Oh, hey, totally. Yeah. Yeah, I'd be totally up for that. Yeah, that would... that would be, like, great. Yeah. So, um... yeah. KAYLA: Someone said that? That's so dumb. So, like, dumb. I just... [SCOFFS] Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'd be totally up for that. That'd be so fun. Yeah, oh... Yeah, it was... it was great. Yeah, it was so fun. [CHUCKLES] Oh... oh, so that happened. Okay. So that's why you couldn't make it. No, I mean, that's fine. Yeah, of course. I'd love to come. Yeah, it'd be great if we could just, like, do that on, like, Wednesday or something. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] - STEPH: Really? - KENNEDY: Yes. KAYLA: Uh, Kennedy. Hey. Um... so, thanks for inviting me to your party. Uh, no problem. By the way, I like your shirt a lot. It's so cool. I have a shirt, too... [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Mmm-hmm. Also, you know, I, like, um... I wrote this, like, letter for you and whatever, uh, so if you want to have it, it's, like, a thank you. Oh, hey, Steph. What? Hey. Hi... Hey, well, thanks for talking to me, you guys, um... Catch you later. [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] KENNEDY: Cool. - GIRL: Oh, my God! - Bang! Dead! - Bang! Dead! - [GUN CLICKING] Bang! Dead! [BOY IMITATING GUNFIRE] Okay... Hey, how about let's give it up for the volunteers from the drama club. What do you say? Okay, kids, we've gone over what you should do if you hear gunshots in the distance. And what are we supposed to do in that situation? ALL: Run in the opposite direction. OFFICER TODD: You sure about that? - Hello? - ALL: Yes. We positive! OFFICER TODD: O... okay. And... but now we're gonna talk about what you should do when the gunshots are close. - Listen up, mister. Um... - [BOY CHATTERS INDISTINCTLY] Um... you know, when the shooter's down the hallway or right outside the classroom. What you just saw was an example of what not to do. Okay? If the gunshots are loud and close, and you're in a classroom or a bathroom, uh, you should do the following... Stay put, turn off the lights... DYLAN: Are you staring at Aiden? Huh? I said, are you staring at Aiden? - [SCOFFS] No. - He's a dick. He dumped Chelsea because she wouldn't send him naked pictures. Oh. That's weird. OFFICER TODD: ...with the dead or wounded. WOMAN: [ON PA] Coach Red to the main office. - Coach Red to the main office, please. - MR. DANKERT: Okay, everyone. That's the signal. Please be respectful of the drill and stay quiet. Should only be a few minutes. - Hey. - Hey. Uh, whatcha doing? Playing a game. Cool. Cool. Um... Uh, are you excited for high school? - Yeah. Should be cool. - Yeah. You ever think there'd be a real shooting here? - I wish. - [CHUCKLES] Same. Um... like... - Why do you wish there was one? - 'Cause I'd fuck him up. Take his gun and elbow him right in the jaw, lay him out. I wouldn't be a pussy and sit under my desk. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, you would fuck him up. He'd be, like, totally screwed. - Yeah. - [CHUCKLES] Oh, my God, that was so embarrassing. Like, it's super funny. You won't, like... It was so funny, Aiden, I just... Like, yeah, it was really funny what just happened. What? [STAMMERS] It's kind of just too embarrassing for me to even, like, talk about. - I mean... - Okay. I mean, I just... I was trying to open up Instagram, and then I ended up pulling up my dirty photos folder, - and it was just... - Really? - Yeah. - What was it of? Just... just, you know, like... - Me. - Doing what? I don't know. Just, you know, like, hanging out. - Can I see it? - No, no. - It's only for my boyfriend to see. - Who's your boyfriend? Uh, he's... uh... you know, like, right now he's off... Well, I mean, I don't really have one right now, but, you know, like, I'm saving some dirty photos to, like, send him when I do have one. [SNIFFS] - Really? - Yeah. You give blowjobs? Uh... MR. DANKERT: Kayla. To answer your question, I do, and I'm, like, really good at them. [BLOWS RASPBERRY] [ANIMALS CHITTERING] Hi, I'm Dr. Kat, and I'm here to give you some tips for performing oral sex on him. First off, you... [INAUDIBLE] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. You didn't. Whatcha up to? Nothing. Cool. School was good? Yeah. Good. Hey, you know who I ran into today? Do you remember that guy who... - Is that a banana? - What? What? You're having a banana? Oh, this, I was just grabbing a banana. I thought you hated bananas. No. I swear, like, a month ago I asked you if you wanted a banana, and you got all angry at me, and you said you hate bananas, and I always forget that you hate bananas. I actually think I wrote a note down about it on my app thing, so I wouldn't - forget... - Uh... I... I don't hate them anymore. Hmm. That's great. Yeah. I'll just eat it right now. Who cares? [SIGHS] Are you sure you like them? Mmm-hmm. - Honey, you don't... you don't look... - [SPITS] Fine! I don't like bananas. Okay? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Yeah? Hey. Hi. How ya doin'? - Good. - Good.

Just so you know, you don't need to, like, worry about me anymore because I'm actually doing really great right now, and my life is really amazing. Cool. - That's awesome. - Yeah. - Okay. Uh... good night. - Okay. Good night. - I love you. - Love you too. [SIGHS] Dear God, tomorrow is... [CLEARS THROAT] Tomorrow is a really, really important day for me, and I really need it... I really need you to make it a good day. I mean... I understand that every day can't be, like, a great day, um... But I really need tomorrow to be a good one. I mean, even if you give me a ton of, like, really bad days in the future or something, um, just as long as tomorrow can be a really good day. All right, uh... that's all. Thank you. Love, Kayla. MR. MCDANIEL: Okay. Settle down! Settle down! You are here for the High School Shadow Program. We're gonna walk in there as a group, and you're gonna be individually paired with a high school student. Now, you are to stay with that student for the entire school day. You are not, repeat, not to leave their side. So please be respectful and take it all in. This is your chance to get a glimpse of what life will be like for you next year. So, pay attention... and have fun. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] Kayla? - Hi! - Hey, hey.

Don't be sorry. I'm... I'm nervous. Like, I want you to have fun. Um, yeah. Okay, cool. This is gonna be great. High school is boring and, like, horrible, but, like, also amazing. - And it's gonna be great. - Okay. People are awesome. You're gonna be... okay, this is gonna be so fun. Okay. You're so cute. Okay, let's go, let's do this, okay? - Um... - BOY: Yo, Liv. Martin got it. - [CHUCKLES] Shut up. - I'm serious. - Oh, my God. Um... - What was that? That's just a stupid inside joke. Um... Babs. Babs, uh, did you... did you do that thing for Kiley's class? - BABS: Fuck no. - Thank God. - Um... - [CHUCKLES] Um, anyway... - Yeah. So do you have any questions for me? - No. No, I mean... - Well, does... - You don't have - to have a question. - Okay. [CHUCKLES] Oh, my God, you're so cute. I feel like we're best friends. Is it weird if we're already best friends? - No. No. Yeah... yeah. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] [VIDEO CAMERA BEEPING] [INAUDIBLE] [ON VIDEO] Hey, guys. It's Kayla, back with another video. So today, I want to talk to you guys about growing up. Okay, so growing up can be a little bit scary and weird, but it's also a really good thing because you get to change things that you might not like about yourself, and that's good because change is a good thing. Okay, so I'm an eighth-grader, which means next year I will be in high school. Now, high school is a lot different than middle school because middle school is like, really, uh... well... High... middle school is, like, in the middle. And in middle school, everyone is a lot younger than high schoolers and, when you're young, you haven't changed as much as when you're older. So, yeah, high schoolers have changed more than middle schoolers, and since change is a good thing, that means that high schoolers are really good. Uh... Okay, uh, next thing about growing up... Yeah, okay. Uh... so the thing about growing up is that it's going to happen, so don't fight it. Some parts of growing up will be really hard and not good, but... I promise that growing up will eventually get really good. I mean, I used to be afraid of growing up, and then I realized it's going to make everything better, and now I can't wait to grow up. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Uh, yeah. Cool. Uh, okay. Uh... Thank you, guys, for watching this video, and make sure to share and subscribe to my channel. Uh, yeah. Thank you, guys, for watching. Gucci. [SIGHS] Hey, Olivia... Hey, Olivia. Uh... Thanks for today. Hey. Uh... [EXHALES] Yeah, I mean totally. OLIVIA: No, I mean, like, honestly, like... Screw those girls, they're just, like, trying so hard to be cool. Pretty much. [CHUCKLES] No. I mean it, Kayla. Don't stress about that stuff. - Okay. I'll... I'll try not to. - No. Eighth grade is the worst. I was, like, a complete mess when I was your age. - Really? - Yes. Oh, my God, yes. Wow, I mean... Wow, um... Oh, also, thanks for letting me, like, call you and stuff because I wasn't sure if I, you know, like, should or if that would be, like, you know, weird or not. Oh, my God, no, no, no, no. Not weird at all. I gave you my number, Kayla. This is... this is what it's for. Thanks. I mean, it's just really nice and kind of, like, just awesome to be able... To be able to, like, you know, talk to someone who's just so, like, cool and they're, like, older and stuff. [CHUCKLES] Oh, my God, well, you know, I don't know how cool I am. [CHUCKLES] Uh, I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool. I mean... I... I... I don't really have, like, a lot of friends at school or whatever because, like, people are, like, stupid like you said. Um... but, I don't know, you've just been so nice to me and you're just... I think... I think that makes you pretty cool. I mean, I made all my close friends in high school. All that's stuff is gonna happen for you. Don't even worry about it. Thanks. [CHUCKLES] You know, hey, um... I don't know if you're around or allowed or whatever, but me and some friends are heading to the mall to just, like, hang if you feel like you wanna come. - Kayla? - [PHONE CLATTERS] Oh, my God. [LAUGHING] Oh, my God. Okay... [BREATHING HEAVILY] Oh, crap. Uh, hey, sorry about that. Uh, I have, like, really, really bad reception at my house. Um... - But if it's still cool if I hang out? - Oh, my gosh, yes. Please come. Oh, okay. Okay, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Awesome. Great. Okay. Uh, yeah, uh, just, okay. - Text me later. - Yeah! Okay, see ya! - Okay. See you. Bye. - Okay, bye. Cool. Yeah. [SIGHS] Oh, fuck. [SIGHS] [WATER RUNNING] - KAYLA: Dad? - Yeah? What's up? [WATER STOPS] Is something wrong? Can I go out with friends tonight? [CELL PHONE VIBRATES] Can you not look like that, please? MARK: What? [SCOFFS] Like what? - Just, like, the way you're looking. - Looking at the road? You can look at the road, Dad. I obviously didn't mean that. Just, like, don't be weird and quiet while you do it. - Sorry. - [SIGHS] [MARK SNIFFS] - Hey, how was the shadow thing... - No, you were being quiet, which is fine. Just, like, don't be weird and quiet because, like, I look over at you, and I think you're about to drive us into a tree or something, and then I get really freaked out, and then I can't text my friends. So just, like, be quiet and drive. And don't look weird and sad. Please. Okay. [KAYLA SIGHS] That's worse. - TREVOR: ...that was two years ago. - OLIVIA: He's still dead. - Think of it. - That's... I'm acknowledging that. I'm just saying, what, we have a triathlon for a kid that died two years ago? - Okay... - TREVOR: No one was running for him then. - He was fat then. - BOTH: Oh, my God... TREVOR: I don't get why, like, everyone has to act like they're his best friend. - OLIVIA: No, it's like... - ANIYAH: Oh, my God... OLIVIA: He died. His whole future was stripped from him. ANIYAH: Did you just put a candle down... TREVOR: That doesn't mean he was a special person, know. - OLIVIA: Oh, my God, you are the most... - You are such an insensitive asshole. ANIYAH: He's dead! - TREVOR: You guys are just following... - We're following... we're following? [OVERLAPPING ARGUMENT] - Hey. - Oh, my God, Kayla! Wait, hi. Guys, guys, guys... okay, so this is Kayla. Sorry. [LAUGHS] She's, like, super chill and amazing and also she's my shadow. And, um, yeah, this is Aniyah, and you guys met today. Riley and Trevor. - Trevor. - The whole... the whole gang. - Are you hungry? - Uh, I'm fine. Okay, well, we're gonna... We're gonna eat, I think. Oh, well, I'll grab food, then. Okay. Okay, cool. Cool. [SNAPS FINGERS] Yay. - My phone... - [BOTH CHUCKLE] All that he did was he put his arm on your shoulder. That's perv... are you defending this perv? Why are you defending him? TREVOR: Why would he... why would he wanna look at... - Why would... - ANIYAH: Why wouldn't he? [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] ANIYAH: Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait... did I tell you guys? - What? - Do you know Brian? - Yeah, of course. - Your friend, Brian. Right. TREVOR: We all know Brian. So, he DM'ed me the other day, right? So, I thought it was a regular DM until I opened it. It's literally just a picture, a cropped picture that I posted the other day, - of just my feet. - Of your feet? - His feet? - ANIYAH: No. My feet. He sent - me a picture of my feet. - That is so weird. Right? Isn't that so creepy? TREVOR: No, he was... he was just trying to flirt with you. - He was being nice. - That's not being nice. That's being pervy. - What you... - He's a perv. - You know what a perv is. [RILEY LAUGHING] What's funny about that, Riley? - I don't know. Just the way he said it was... - How did he say it? [CHUCKLES] What? Why am I being yelled at? This is yelling to you? No, this is an adult tone. This is the volume that adults use. Not that quiet, little mouse shit that you do. I don't understand why you can't just speak up for yourself. - TREVOR: Riley's a thinker. - ANIYAH: Oh, he's a thinker? - That's what it is? - [SCOFFS] - Why's looking speaking... - You know, I used to be, like, really quiet too. - [WHISPERS] No, I'm not quiet. - [CHUCKLES] No. You're quiet. - [KAYLA MOUTHING] - [OTHERS CHATTERING] ANIYAH: Let him talk for himself. - I'm not screaming at anybody! - Oh, that's not screaming, what? [LAUGHS] - I was... - I will record you and, like... - play it back. - Show you that you're yelling. - Are you bored, Kayla? - Huh? - TREVOR: You look bored. - [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] - I'm not bored. - Trev. Stop. - TREVOR: What? No. - You don't have... - to answer. - I'm not judging her. It's fine. We're boring her. - She's a different generation than us. - She's not a different generation. - Yes, she is. - She's four years younger than us, I mean. Okay, but people who were, like, four years older than us felt, like, fucking 50 years old. - That's, like, blatantly not true. - TREVOR: Your sister. - My sister just sucks. - Okay, but, like, on top of that, she didn't have Twitter in middle school, and we did. That made us different. Kayla, you're not different than us. Yeah... when did you get Snapchat? What grade? - Fifth grade. - Fifth grade? What? No, see! ANIYAH: Wait, so were kids, like, sending each other, like, nudes in, like, fifth grade? - No, okay, that is a weird question. No, no... - No, I just say... - What? I'm just asking a question. - TREVOR: No, that is what Snapchat is for! She's seeing dicks in fifth grade, she's, like, wired differently. She's not wired different. I'm not saying it's, like, a bad thing. - I'm just making... - Dude, stop. Stop. Let's stop this. - Let's stop this, now. - Jesus Christ. Fine! - We're moving on. - I'm just making a fun point. - Okay, fun point made. Let's go. Okay. - Dude, don't bring me into this shit. I actually like the filters on Snapchat and stuff. - Those are cool. - OLIVIA: Yeah. Me too. Okay, guys, don't all look at the same time, but some creepy ass dude has been staring at us for so long... - Oh? - ANIYAH: Don't. Don't... I see him, in the... - Oh... I left something in a store. I'll be back. - OLIVIA: Do you want me to... - Really nice. - What? - I didn't do anything. - Okay. Stop. - MARK: Hey, honey. - Get away from me! [SIGHS] MARK: I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to spy on you. [CHUCKLES] I just suck, I... I'm just... You see, sometimes, dads are just really weird and, uh, I'm just being weird. Uh, all right. I'm... you know, I'm just gonna... You know, I'm just gonna get out of here. I'm just gonna go, and you just have fun with your friends and just text me when you want me to pick you up. Okay, I'll get a ride home. Okay. Yeah. All right, so, yeah. Just have fun, and, um... Here, why don't you, um, take this and get yourself, like, a... A pretzel or something. [CLEARS THROAT] Okay. I'm just going to leave it here. And, uh, yeah. Just have fun, and... [CLEARS THROAT] All right. I'm sorry. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] OLIVIA: Aniyah and Trev need to chill. RILEY: I know. It's like I can't say anything around them. They can just be a lot sometimes. - You have fun tonight, Kayla? - Yeah. Totally. Good. She's just, like, so fun and easy to be around, isn't she? RILEY: Totally. You know, I was... I was just, like, sitting there or whatever, like, watching you guys eat, and all I was thinking was, like, - you guys are just so cool. - I think you're cool! [CHUCKLES] OLIVIA: You wanna drop her off first? I mean, you're right here. - Yeah, but it's late. We should get her home. - No, it's fine. - Yeah? You sure? - KAYLA: Yeah. All good. [CHUCKLES] Okay, cool. This was the best. Let's do it again soon. Um... You're awesome. You rule. You're great. Bye. Uh, good night. - Good night, Riley. - RILEY: Bye. [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] RILEY: Yeah, Olivia's cool, yeah? Yeah, totally. She's, like, the best. Yeah, we're, like, best friends. - [CHUCKLES] Really? - Yeah. That's awesome. [CHUCKLES] Kind of awkward talking when you're in the back seat. Yeah... [CHUCKLES] Here, uh, hold on. - Uh... should I get in the front? - No. No, no, no, it's all good. [TAPPING CAR HOOD] [GRUNTS] [RILEY EXHALES] - So... you excited about next year? - Yeah, totally. Yeah. Totally. I mean, you should be. You're like the coolest freshman I've ever met, and you're not even a freshman yet. [KAYLA CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] - Thanks. - It's crazy. Yeah. I mean, you should watch out for guys, definitely. Like... They're gonna try to pick you up, you know? - Yeah. - [CHUCKLES] Really? Yeah. I mean, definitely. - Yeah, right. - No. I'm serious. [CHUCKLES] RILEY: Hmm. Truth or Dare? Uh... what? Oh, Truth or Dare? - You ever play Truth or Dare? - Oh. - Yeah. Sorry. - Yeah? Yeah? - Uh... - Truth or Dare? Uh... Truth. Okay, uh... [CHUCKLES] How far have you gone? - How far have I gone? - Yeah. Yeah, like, uh... - First base, or... - Oh, okay, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh... [EXHALES] I don't know. Do you mean, like, you know, all time or, uh, like, more recent, or... Let's go all time. Well, okay then... [CHUCKLES] Uh... I don't know. I'd say, like... You know, third base. - Whoa! - Yeah. Sorry, just kidding. I meant second, you know. I get second and third, like, mixed up a lot, you know. - You're funny. - [CHUCKLES] I mean, it's okay if you haven't done anything. Yeah. You wanna ask me? Uh... okay. Yeah. - Uh... how far have you... - Oh, no. No. Truth or Dare. - [CHUCKLES] Right. - It starts there, and then... - Duh. - Yeah. Uh... okay, well, uh... Truth or Dare. I'll take Dare. - Okay... - Yeah. Uh... Uh... put this quarter in your mouth. - Ew! - [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Sorry, that was gross. Uh... no, it's... Okay, well, like, you know... uh... What do you... what do you want to do? You know. You... you can pick. [RILEY CHUCKLES] I don't know. Shit, um... So much. [RILEY CLICKING TONGUE] [CHUCKLES] I could take my shirt off? I mean, that's stupid though. Is that stupid? - Uh... no. - No? - That... that's fine. - Fuck. I feel like a fucking idiot. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Is it fine if I take my shirt off? Yeah? Okay. I don't know. All right. Gonna do it. [GRUNTS] [RILEY CHUCKLES] Truth or Dare? Uh... Uh... uh... Truth. You're no fun. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Uh... sorry. Uh, okay, well... Dare. Take your shirt off. - Uh, I'm not, like, super comfortable with that. - Well, do you think I'm comfortable right now? - [CHUCKLE] - [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] - I don't know... - Calm down, relax. Take a deep breath. Come on. - Take your shirt off. - No! Sorry. I... - I'm really sorry. - RILEY: It's fine. - I'm sorry. - Stop saying you're sorry. I said it was fine, dude. Okay? So, stop saying that, okay? You know, and now you're gonna have your first hookup with some asshole at a party, and you're not gonna be good at it, and he's gonna tell all his friends about it, and you're gonna get made fun of and feel like shit. - Do you want that? - No. This was about you. Okay? I'm... I'm trying... I was trying to help you, okay? I know. I really appreciate it. I just... [STAMMERING] I'm sorry. I mean... it was just... It was a lot at once, you know. I... I don't know, I just... I... I didn't want to do that right now. Please don't tell Olivia about this. Night. [SNIFFLES] MARK: Hey. How'd it... Honey? Kayla? [BEEPING] [ON VIDEO] Hey, guys. It's Kayla, back with another video. Um... So... I'm making this video to just kind of say that I'm not gonna be making videos anymore. Or, you know, I'm taking a break or something. Um... And I don't... I don't know if anyone is, like, really watching or cares, um... But if you are, sorry if this is, like, a bummer to you. Um... but... It's the right thing to do, um... I started making videos, you know, to, like, give tips and stuff. And, you know, help you guys out, but... I don't know. If I'm being really honest, I'm probably not, like, the best person to give advice because I like, you know, I like giving advice and, like, and talking about doing stuff, but I can't really actually do that stuff. Um... And... yeah. [SIGHS] And... I don't know. It's just, like... Um... I'm really, like, nervous all the time, and... I... Like, I could be doing nothing, and I'm just nervous. It's like, um... It's like I could... [STAMMERS] I'm waiting in line for, like, a roller coaster, and that stupid, like, butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling you get, like... I get that all the time, and then I never get the feeling of after you ride the roller coaster, and I... I try really hard not to feel that way, um... But... I don't know. I just can't... um... [SIGHS] So, I think if you guys are going through, like, tough times and stuff, um, you deserve someone who can go through tough times and make themselves feel better with their advice, and actually do the stuff they talk about. You know, just... If they can make themselves feel better, then maybe they can help you feel better. Um... So, yeah, I think those are the reasons why I'm gonna stop making videos, um... And, yeah. [SIGHS] I hope you guys all have, like, you know, good lives, and maybe I'll see you guys around. Bye. Gucci. [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] YOUNG KAYLA: [ON VIDEO] Hey, Kayla! It's you. Kayla. I'm just making this video to congratulate you on finishing eighth grade. Whoo-hoo! I am so, so, so, so proud of you! Okay, so I'm making this video on a Friday. Um, and, yeah, Fridays are really fun. And I'm about to have my first middle school weekend. Um... and I bet it's not really exciting to you, or whatever, because you've already had a bunch of middle school weekends, but it's really exciting to me. Yeah, I have, like, so many questions for you also. Like, do you have a boyfriend? And is he nice? Uh, what's the coolest thing you've done, or the second coolest thing you've done? Uh, yeah, so you don't have to answer because I can't hear you anyways. But, yeah, thanks for listening. Bye. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Can you help me burn something in the backyard? Yes. You sure you want to do this? Yeah. I'm not exactly sure what "this" is... Or means... I just hope that whatever we're doing here is a positive thing? Yeah. All right then. What was in there? Nothing, really. Um... Just sort of my hopes and dreams. Right. And you're burning them? Yeah. - Do I make you sad? - What? No. No, not at all. Not at all. Why? Do I seem sad? No. What... why would you think you make me sad? [SIGHS] I... I don't know, it's just... just... Sometimes, you know, I think that when I'm older, you know, maybe I'll have a daughter of my own or something, and... [SIGHS] I feel like, you know, if she was like me... Um... Then being her mom would make me sad all the time. I... Because, like, you know, I'd love her because she's my daughter, you know, but... I don't know, I just think if she turned out like me that being her mom would make me really sad. You're wrong. Kayla... Kayla, hey, look at me. Look at me. You're wrong. If... if you grow up to have a daughter like you, she will make you so, so happy, I... Being your dad makes me so happy, Kayla. You don't know. You don't know how... how happy you make me. It's beyond... it's... [STAMMERS] I... I can't describe it. It's, um... It's so easy to love you. It's so easy to... to be proud of you. I'm not just saying this. Hey, I swear to God, I'm not just saying this. I mean, sure, sometimes, if I see you're upset or having a... A rough day, then I feel sad. But... That kind of being sad, that sort of day-to-day sad, or worrying that I do, that's not... Kayla, always, beneath all that, I am always just so unbelievably happy that I get to be your dad. When Mom left, I was really scared. I was really, really scared. I... I was scared you weren't gonna be okay. [SIGHS] And then you started to get older. And you got... I don't know. You took your first steps, and you said your firsts words, and you made your first friend. All the things I thought I was going to have to teach you. How to be nice, how to share, how to care about other people's feelings. You just started doing that on your own. You know, your teachers would always say to me, "You've got such a lovely daughter. You... you've done such a great job with her." But I didn't do anything. I really didn't. I really didn't. I just watched you. And the more I watched you, the... the less scared I got. Does that make sense? I stopped being scared about whether you were going to be okay a long time ago. [SIGHS] Do you know why? Because of you. You make me brave. And if you could just see yourself how I see you, which is how you are... [CHUCKLES] How you really are, how you always have been, I swear to God, you wouldn't be scared either. [SIGHS] MR. MCDANIEL: Friends, family, and loved ones. Today is a celebration. A chance for us to applaud the achievements of these amazing kids, Miles Grove Middle School's Class of 2017. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] Soon, these kids will embark on the next chapter of their lives. - [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] - Everybody, please... [SHUSHES] [STUDENTS CHATTERING] Guys, guys, guys, come on, please. Just... [SHUSHES] Just a few minutes. Okay, please. [SHUSHES] Please, thank you. Hey. I... I... I wrote you that letter thanking you for inviting me to your birthday party, and you didn't write back or anything! I didn't even get a DM on, like, Instagram or whatever. And you know what? You're... you're always mean to me, and I'm always nice to you, and being mean isn't nice. And when somebody does something nice to you, you're supposed to be nice back, and you're always mean to me, and I know... I'm a good person because I'm always nice to you, and you're just... And, also, that card game I got you is, like, a really fun version of Go Fish or whatever, and you'd actually know if you played it instead of trying to be cool all the time. [STAMMERS] It's, like, dumb, or whatever, but you know... It's dumb in a way that's fun to play when it's raining outside, and you'd know that if you stopped trying to be cool all the time! And... [BREATHING HEAVILY] GABE: Welcome. Wow. Thank you. - Would you like to, uh, take a seat? - Oh. Uh, sure. GABE: Cool. You, uh, you like chicken nuggets, right? - Yeah. - Okay. Cool. I got a 20-piece, and I also got two of every kind of sauce. But, you know, if you have a favorite sauce, and you want more than one packet of it, you can have mine. I like all the sauces equally. - Thanks. - Yeah. Oh, and the nuggets have been sitting out for a little bit because, you know, I didn't know when you'd be here, so just, uh, tell me if they're too cold, and I can heat them up in the microwave, okay? - Okay. - Yeah. Oh. Whoops. Sorry, must have left this out by accident. Sorry. I'm so stupid. Uh, no problem. You want to see it? No, wait. No, it's stupid. Sure. Okay. Yeah. Cool. What is it? Oh, well, I go to archery camp every summer. And last summer, I got five bull's-eyes in a day so you know, they gave me the Sharpshooter of the Week Award. - That's actually really cool. - Yeah, not really. It's... it's stupid. Um... I think it's really cool, but... - Yeah. - Well, I think it's stupid. - [CHUCKLES] - Yeah. Okay. Yeah. To our, uh, first friend hangout, I guess. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. Oops. Do you believe in God? Um... Yes. Okay. Cool. [CLEARS THROAT] Um... you like the silverware? - Yeah. It's really cool. - Yeah. It's, uh, a lightsaber. Check it out. [IMITATES LIGHTSABER WHOOSHING] [IMITATES LIGHTSABER WHOOSHING] [CHUCKLES] I've, uh... I've seen some of your videos. - Oh, those are really dumb. - No, no, no, no, no. They're actually really cool. - I... I love those videos. Um... - [CHUCKLES] You're really... you're really smart about stuff. Like, you know a lot of things. Thanks. I was thinking you should, maybe you can... Maybe have, like, your own talk show or something. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Am I being weird at all to you? - Like, uh... - No, no, no. - Okay. Good. I'm nervous... I'm just nervous. - You're fine. No, no, no. It's fine. Um... - I am, too. Yeah. - Yeah. Um... Am I being, like, quiet? - Or too, like... - No way. Okay, am I, like, talking enough? You've been pretty talkative, but not in an annoying way. - Just, uh... just responding to me, you know. - Thanks. Yeah. This is a... this is a good conversation, don't you think? - Yeah. We're doing some good talking. - Yeah. It's a nice chat. Yep. [CHUCKLES] You know what would go great with this? - KAYLA: Hmm? - Some Szechuan sauce! - You like Rick and Morty, too? - Yes. Yes. Yes. - Nice. - [IMITATES RICK] Yes! Yes, Morty. The Szechuan sauce! We gotta... we gotta get it, Morty. - Come on, Morty, come on! - [IMITATES MORTY] Oh, jeez, - Rick. - Shut up. Morty. - Yes! - Rick, I don't know! - That's so cool. - Yes... yes Morty. Keep... keep doing the voice, Morty. Yes, of course. [BOTH LAUGH] - That show's amazing. - Yeah. Hmm. You are awesome. [CHUCKLES] Thanks. No problem. - MARK: Hey. - Hey. You have fun? Yeah. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Good. [BEEPING] KAYLA: Hey, Kayla. Um... it's you, from eighth grade. Congrats on finishing high school. I'm so proud of you. And it's crazy to think that, like, you're almost 18. Um... and I bet you probably look a lot different than me, which is cool. Or, if you don't, and you look, you know, mostly the same, that's cool too. How did you do on the SATs? I mean, hopefully good. But if not, you know, school sucks. Especially math. Um... Uh, what else? Um, do you have a boyfriend? It's cool if you don't, but if you do, he should be treating you well because you deserve it. Is Dad still a dork? Because, if he's not, he's probably just someone pretending to be Dad. [SNIFFS] - Smell it. Smell it. - Dad, stop. Dad... Dad... And I really hope that you're not too sad about, like, leaving all your friends for college, but you can still stay in contact with them. And if you don't, that's fine. Because you'll make new friends at college anyway, so it's, like, whatever. And I know, like, you probably don't want any advice from some dumb eighth-grader or whatever, but if high school sucked for you, I'm really sorry about that. And that, you know, that sucks. But I mean, it's whatever. Middle school wasn't so great for me, but I'm past it now. And I'm moving forward, and you can do that too with high school if it didn't go great. Just because things are happening to you right now doesn't mean that they're always gonna happen to you. And things will change. And... You know, you never know what's gonna, like, happen next, and that's what makes things exciting and scary. And fun. Yeah, okay. So, stay cool, and I can't wait to be you. Love, Kayla. Gucci!
