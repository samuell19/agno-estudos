Allow us to introduce ourselves. -I'm KASHIYUKA. -I'm a-chan. I'm NOCCHi and together we are… Perfume! Thank you for watching. -Moving on… -Okay. We wanted… -We wanted to do this show… -Yes. We're all sweaty and out of breath. Sorry. Thank you all so much for watching Imaginary Museum "Time Warp" today. Thank you. For our anniversary… despite the circumstances, there were many who wanted to celebrate. It made me so happy to hear people say that. We've received your warm thoughts, and so we put together this event today. This has all been thanks to you. Thank you so much. This time… with Imaginary Museum, we took our conceptualized view of the world up until now, and created this museum made up of different rooms. -Right. -I hope everyone enjoyed it. How did you like it? How was it? Oh yes, I see. Good. How was it, NOCCHi? Oh, me? Thank you all so much for watching. Imaginary Museum, marks 20 years since we became a group and 15 since our major debut. I am so incredibly happy that we were able to have such a fantastic event in celebration of this special day. We've all created the history that has led Perfume to this point. And today… Um… I was able to think back on all of it while we were performing, and it couldn't have made me happier. Thank you so much to everyone who helped us and to those who supported us by watching today. Thank you! How about you, Yuka? Thank you all so much for watching. For this performance, we really wanted to challenge ourselves to deliver a new kind of show. We still have a lot of potential, and if we do a little digging, we can find lots of ways to connect with our audience. That's what this performance made me realize. The final result was this video that encompasses all your thoughts, and with its Time Warp theme, it faces us towards what's coming next. I hope that we can all keep heading towards a bright future. I know that we will all meet again, so please wait a little longer. Thank you very much. -So nice. -Go ahead, a-chan. Okay, well… During this time, we've been able to do a lot of thinking about our feelings… our regrets… About things we're passionate to try, and creating something people would see and think, "Now that's cool." This has been a miraculous time where we really came together as a team to create that kind of performance. We realized that we had been taking these things for granted, but change is inevitable, and it's a challenge that we can rise to. Believing that, we made this video. So many people have helped in putting together each and every shot and so many other things. Today, we're here with our usual concert staff. They're always supporting us from the bottom of their hearts, and it's because of them that we were able to do this. We're so sad that we can't see you all right now, but we won't give in to that feeling. We will continue to strive to be who we are and do what we can. Thank you all so much for today. -So then… -Yes. Shall we go to the next room? Yes, let's go! Yes, let's! Now, I wonder what this next room could be… This is going to make me cry. Wow, what a great room! Okay. I'm sure at this time, we're all leading very different lives, and experiencing different emotions, but I hope that we can all spend our time enjoyably. And now Perfume's new song, "Time Warp." Thank you very much. And with that… Subtitle translation by Nicole Wilkinson
