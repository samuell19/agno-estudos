Brussels… Good things happen here. Bad things, too. Like in all big cities. This is a shopping street. All the shops are here. Over there's the clubhouse. They put on that play I was talking about. Eva. Your name is Eva, right? Over there, do you see it? The best bar in Brussels. Most people hang around Midi station. But this is the place to be. You hear that? Brussels' anthem. We're used to it. I can't sleep if I don't hear sirens. How was it? Did you get some good images? There's nothing interesting to see here. Let's go someplace else. -Take it easy, we're going. -Stop the camera. -Easy, we're going. -What are you filming? Put the camera away. Put it away. Stop filming. Turn it off. -Calm down. -It's switched off. It's switched off. Stay in the car. I'll talk to them. Fuck. Look at their faces. It's like Jurassic Park. If they get in, we'll have a problem. -Just stay calm, we'll be fine. -Stay calm? For all we know, this is a set-up. -Right, Joerie? -Are the doors locked, Eva? -Who is that? -Are the doors locked? They're all locked. -Eva, just… start the car and drive. -Come on, do it. -Get out of here. -Don't be scared. It's cool. -Whatever, dude. -Don't let him in. Eva, I'm not kidding, just put your foot down and go. He's trying to get in. Hey. Goddamnit. You're lucky I'm here. Eva, what are you doing? Ah, a Flemish guy. Goeiedag. Alles goed? Godverdomme. -You speak Dutch? -What? -Dutch? -Are you crazy? What's the point of that? -What are you doing here? -We're filming a news report. Hold on, hold on. You want to show the neighborhoods as they really are? Yes. With Jean-Rachid as your guide? Yes, last time-- He only appears when there's a camera around. -Could you do any better? -What? Why don't you show us around the neighborhoods? Okay. Deal. That will be 100 euros. -What? -What? Do you do it for free? Is it just a hobby? So where are we going? Riots in Molenbeek, Anderlecht, Sint-Gillis. Brussels' hotspots. Teenage immigrants arrested for theft. Most criminals are from poor neighborhoods mostly inhabited by immigrants. -Moroccan youths. -The suspect is of Moroccan extraction. …carried out the stabbing. A group of Moroccan youths attacked a police car. The perpetrator is thought to be a member of a North African gang. Teenage immigrants arrested for theft. Witnesses report seeing a man of foreign extraction. Robberies. Carjackings. …of North African extraction. The murder suspect probably has North African roots. Ten Muslim teenagers were arrested for public violence this morning. North African criminals smuggled drugs via Belgium. The drug dealers are of foreign extraction. -Most prisoners are immigrants. -…higher number of foreigners in prison. The man who carried out the stabbing had light brown skin and ran off… -…youths of Moroccan extraction. -There were immigrant youths present. Witnesses report seeing a man of foreign extraction. …several Moroccan youths threw stones at police. It is not clear what led to this. This morning, ten Muslim teenagers were arrested for public violence. The greatest threat to our safety is the increasing number of Muslim youths. Water cannons were used to disperse the violent crowd. Ten Muslim youths were arrested for robbery. Schools and social workers have no influence on the youths. A number of teenage immigrants threw Molotov cocktails. -Cars were set on fire. -More and more immigrant youths… Immigrant youths take to the street to express their anger. -Hello, ladies. How was it? -A jungle, man. -Really? -It was okay. Okay? It got pretty tricky out there. Our wannabe war reporter. In a war you know the enemy. This is infiltrating behind enemy lines. Here or there, what's the difference? It's different for you. They never attack sound guys. You'd be surprised just how many people think this is a camera. Next time we'll get you a helmet and a bulletproof vest. And put tape round it and write "TV" on it. Eva? Herman is waiting for you in his office. I know that. Come on, Peter, you can't be serious. We've hardly any budget as it is. Yeah, that's what I told you. I told you that. How was it? Good? Then we can air it later. No, Peter, that budget was fixed. Yes. -Why? -Hold on a sec. You've had a lot of time already. -I'm trying to make it good. -Yes, but you should be wrapping it up. -Says who? -We do, the channel. I thought you were the channel? Don't complain, okay? Peter… What are you talking about? Of course. The media game won't change. Where did you get that idea? I've just found an insider from the area who wants to show us around. You've got one week. No, a budget is a budget. Okay? My viewers demand quality and quality costs money. Hi, Eva. What's it like being in those neighborhoods? A lot of sexism? No, I'm not working on a story about this news team. Can it go on air later? -I've got another week. -What? How did you pull that off? I know these kids, they come here every day. One day they buy from my shop, the next day they smash the place up. Move the car, immediately. Hurry up or we'll have it towed away. That's it, move along. We haven't got all day. -Hi guys, how are you doing? -Alright. -Everything okay? -Yeah. Good, you're all looking healthy. You should all be in school. -It's a holiday. -A holiday? Which holiday? Carnival, Easter, Valentine's Day? -So arrest us. -I'll call you mother, Hamid. Jilali, I'll have coffee with your sister later. Okay? -Wait, wait. -I don't want you playing truant again. -Miss, you're awesome. -Yes… Why did you take part in the protest? No one fucks with us. Those Flemish… -Not the police, not the skinheads. -Those racists. Those bastards. Maybe it's because of you. Maybe it's because of you. The media. You're the ones screwing us over. When do we make it onto the screen? When riots occur, robberies… No wonder we have a terrible image. The situation is getting out of hand. Maybe we should get rid of your boss. And have one of us take his place. That would change the situation, and the way you see us. -Did you get some good shots? -Yes, absolutely. -Can we be the first to see them? -Sure, I'll give you a DVD. Take some background shots and be sure to record some sound. Okay. -Can I have a cigarette? -It's my last one. We can share it if you like. -Here you are. -Thanks. You're welcome. See this neighborhood? Do you know what it was like 20 years ago? -No. -Exactly the same. It was crap yesterday and it is crap today. And it will still be crap in 20 years' time. -Is there no one who can change it? -You know… there are people who could. -Who? -We ourselves could. Once we stop messing up, we'll get down to it. I'm going to tell you the story Of a kid called Momo At 12 he gets up early, bravo Grown-ups surely respect him Like him, though There aren't many, you know He starts rapping And gradually slapping What does he do with his life? What's it like? That is it, Momo is 18 He's not called "Momo" But "delinquent," and "mean" It's a shame that he Who was such a sweet lad Over time has become so bad Sir, that's my seat. Sir. That's my seat. -Hey, sir. -There are other seats. That is my fucking seat. -What's up with this guy? -I don't know. -Want me to get my gun out? -Relax, what are you doing? -There are cameras there. -To hell with the cameras. Sir, it's just a joke. We're not stereotypes. Wow, Lahbib… Check out that blonde. Wow, what a chick. I'm going to get her number. -You, with that hair? -Johnny Depp, brother. Bonjour. Can I ask you a question? Russia? Kalashnikov, Molotov cocktail, Chernobyl… Right? One more stop and it would've been in the bag. -Hi. Have you been here long? - Yes, I've already ordered an aperitif. Did you do something to your hair? -I like it. It's nice. -I went to the hairdresser for you. Hamid, give me your best haircut. You don't think I'm going to cut your hair like Johnny Depp's? Lahbib, you will still look like a retard. Look at that ugly face in the mirror. That's you, my friend. Don't listen to them. They are just jealous. Samir, calm down. It is not going to hurt. Come on. -Where are you from? -Iraq. -What's his name? -Samir. Samir, look at me. Are you afraid it will hurt? Give me the trimmer. You're right, that hurts. Give me yours, Hamid. Wow, that's cool. It even tickles. You want to switch? You take the nice one, I'll take the naughty one. -I've had a great evening. -Yeah. Thanks for giving me a lift home. I hear you've spent a week on a story about Schaarbeek. And Molenbeek. A week for a short report seems a bit long, right Herman? I'm sure she'll deliver. The problem is that revenue is down this year. We have to be selective about what we spend our money on. A piece that digs deep is perfect, right? Those riots were ages ago. The viewers will have lost interest. We need scoops. I've just gained the trust of an insider from the area. Not some social worker. It'll be a story like you've never seen before. It's a unique chance to go into depth, present a different image of them. They've had enough negative coverage. Can't you show what you've got? You have enough. You may have more time but you don't have to use it all. Aren't you the boss? Management can't interfere with content. Finish it as soon as possible and get it broadcast. Joeri and Geert have been put on another job. You will be too. I'm making the best thing people have ever seen. What you have made should have been aired ages ago. I told you she wasn't ready. My brother. -I'll pay later. -You should pay now. Oh… What's your problem, my friend? -We've known each other for ages. -Yes. I always pay you, damn it. -Chill, cousin. -Chill cousin… I thought Pakis played cricket? -Want one? -Stop. -They're good. -Stop this. Pay this now. -Damn. -Calm down. What? Let's go. You can keep your fucking crisps. Let's go. Fuck off. Faster next time. I almost killed him with his own bat. -We didn't know what you were going to do. -It happened spontaneously. -Hello? -Lahbib? -Who's this? -Eva. Hi, Eva. How are things? -Good, and with you? -I'm fine. -Can we meet tomorrow? -If you want. Where are you shooting? -I'll be alone. -All alone? Without your pals? -Yes, with a small camera. Okay, I don't care. It's the same price. I thought the 100 euros covered everything? We'll see tomorrow. -Two o'clock, Etangs Noirs metro? -Perfect. -See you tomorrow. -Right, see you tomorrow. Wait, wait. -Thank you. -You alright? Yes. -Who are you here for? -Willem De Raedt. -You're the new intern? -Yes, I am. Don't stress too much. It's not a jungle here or anything. My hair probably looks awful. No, no, it's… fine. -I'm Sara. -Eva. Follow me. If a factory like that shut down here we'd have done tons of items on it. But it's like you say, it's not happening here. -Anything else? -Dairy farmers are protesting against-- You're late. You'd better have some good ideas. Is she one of them? -Willem, this is your new intern, Sara. -Oh yes, hello. How do you do? This is where all the bright minds gather to make Herman shine. I'm curious to see what you'll bring me this week. Because according to the last quarter's ratings, I didn't shine enough. We've got the European farmers, the Twitter murder… -Who's that? -The new intern. -Nice to meet you. -What do you think of our show? -It's fantastic. -No, honestly. -I mean it. -Really? -Yes. -There you have it, friends. Herman Verbeeck doesn't just appeal to older audiences. Twitter. You're joking. No one's interested in that. It started as an argument between 15-year-old kids on Twitter and got totally out of hand. They hired a young guy to kill the girl. That'd make a great episode for a detective series. There's the rumors about sexual harassment at the Department of Defence. Rumors are useless. -We've got some statements. -Yes, but is it true? -No, no. Is it interesting? Next topic. -Belgium's Salafi population is growing. Aha. That's what keeps my viewers up at night. -You can bet on it. -It's a difficult group to infiltrate. Very difficult. -We've tried before but had no luck. -In Brussels? -Brussels and Antwerp. -It can't be that hard to find someone. No, long beard, djellaba and short pants. -Why don't you take it? -No, thanks. Our star reporter prefers the dairy farmers. We tried to interview an imam from a Brussels mosque once, but… He'd been imported from Saudi Arabia. -He just gave a rehearsed speech. -We got nothing useful. He stayed within his comfort zone. If you want to access that world, you have to establish trust, a relationship. Like you in those neighborhoods? Those guys will never talk to a white person, let alone a woman. -Karim, what do you think? -It won't be any easier for me. -They'll just see me as a reporter. -Just try, alright? Okay. -Right, who's doing the farmers? -I'll do it. This is where we all pretend to be working very hard. -That's Karim. -We've already met. -Eva. -Yes. This is Joeri. Yep, she's on her way to the top. A promising career. -He refused two battles, Rohff is-- -But what does Booba have to do with rap? No, stop talking to me. -You just have to… He can't sing. -Who can't sing? Hey, watch out, Officer Mina may come past. Alright, thanks, Lahbib. Booba is the best. -Who's playing? -Barcelona versus Real Madrid. -Which team are they cheering for? -This is a Barcelona bar. Who do Moroccans generally support? Barcelona or Real Madrid? Fifty-fifty. Choice of team has divided families. -Everybody has a favorite team. -But they're Spanish teams. What's the connection with Morocco? I never said it was logical. It's just the way it is. Who are you going to interview next? -You. -Me? What's in it for me? Nothing. -Forget it then. -Don't you dare? Are you scared? Go on, say something. What do you want me to say? You want a guide, no problem. -On the left is-- -Just act natural. -Lahbib. My friend. -Hi, what's going on, nigga? -Don't call me nigga, you faggot. -Let's say hello. -How are you? -Fine. You? -Such is life. -Everything's good. -Hello. -Hello. -It's been a long time. -I've been good. And you? Eva is a documentary maker. Can she shoot some footage here? If she doesn't disturb the clients, it's fine by me. -Alright. Thanks. -Handsome. Do you see, Eva? If you want to be respected, only one thing matters: the haircut. So we come here every two to three weeks. Moroccans are the best hairdressers ever. Our specialty is the layered look. -Stop it. Do you want my spot? -No, thanks. Do people ask for haircuts from the magazines? These magazines here are for people while they wait. They can look and dream. Straight, blonde hair. Blue eyes, pockets full of money. After a while… boom. You wake up. Curly hair. Only a trimmer can help. -Do white people come here too? -Not very often. -Do you know how to cut this? -I can cut any style in the world. You should have black people in your magazines. We all are the same after all… "Africans." -So, did you get some good footage? -Yes. Are you hungry? -Enjoy your food. -You too. If we don't want to be a hairdresser or a criminal… we can work at a snackbar. -You didn't want to do either? -Not really. You mean young Moroccans can only choose between two jobs? No. You can clean Brussels' streets. Or become a tram or bus driver. -Do you like it? -Very much. Three Michelin stars. So Eva, since I'm the star of your story, do you want to see where I live? -Yes, I'd love to. -Cool. Here we are. This is my territory. I cleaned up especially for you. Sit down, relax. Welcome. -You play the guitar? -A little. No, please don't film me. Why not? It's really good. No, it's personal. It's this neighborhood. -It doesn't fit your image? -No, exactly. Not at all. So you never play music with your friends? I do, gangsta rap. But Arabic lyric poetry is for a musht. A musht? It's difficult to explain if you're not from BX. A musht is like a moron. -So you are a musht? -Are you crazy? I'll take you to a hip hop party, and you'll see. I thought you'd have a cooler hobby. Like shooting or something. I have a lot of hobbies. I'm the coolest guy around, baby. I can get you a gun, right now. Whatever you want. Nine mm, Tek 9… Uzi. Even a fucking bazooka, if you want. Okay. Give me the camera. -Come on, give it to me. -No. Give it to me. You've filmed me all day. But I'm not allowed to film, is that it? How does this crap work? There. There we go. That's it. Do something. Come on, do something. -Shit. -What? You want some shit? No, I have to go. -Are you in a hurry? -Yes. You saw the ratings too, we dropped even further last week. -It's just temporary. -But Herman is passé. Really. It's old school. You should come and work for us. Your news team is too small. Yes, but it's on small channels that people like you can grow. We don't have some old fossil stuck in his job. Herman Verbeeck is a strong brand. He's like an airplane crashing in slow motion. That's what Herman Verbeeck is. I know he's your mentor, but… It's thanks to people like you that he retains his position. -Don't let that bastard intimidate you. -Thanks for the advice. But I'm afraid lots of viewers still like the old fossil. Come on, let's go say hello. Are you still working on this? The week's over. Is it any good? It'll allow you to shine. Funny, I almost gave the story to someone else. -Why? Wasn't I good enough? -No, no. Quite the opposite. Everyone here was convinced you'd be eaten alive out there. Because you look like a little angel. But I knew better. You don't let go. You're like a pitbull with a bone. We don't need to win awards with it. -It's just TV, right? -Yes, it is. Here. An invitation to a party. I intended to give it to Mitch, but if you want… Some important people will be there. It could be interesting. Go home. Lahbib. How are you? Long time no see. Are you doing well? -How did you get out? -Oh… A procedural error, as they say. Those idiots had to release me. It's a crap system. That's all behind me now. But tell me about you. How have you been? What have you done since prison? -How's your business? Still trafficking? -Fuck off. What? Don't talk to me like that. Don't you remember who took care of you when you were out of your depth? -You owe me respect. -Don't. Get out of my neighborhood. Your neighborhood? It's mine too. Not for long. What do you mean? Are you threatening me? -After all I did for you-- -Everyone knows. They don't. It's just rumors. Someone says something, someone else repeats it. It's just air, it's crap. That's all. I don't care. If I see you around here again, you'll regret it. Don't listen to what people say. Lahbib. We're friends, right? You're dressed elegantly. I see you have good political connections. It's always pleasant to have a drink with friends. And they come in handy, that's true. What's the point of a reception like this, except to get drunk on champagne? It's called networking. Showing your face, making connections. Meeting important people. Everything to help further your career. So good work is less important than good connections? No, they are equally important. If you want to make it to the top. Why did you give me the invitation? Why do you always ask such stupid questions? Because I believe in you, Eva. But apparently I was wrong. So now I have to go and socialize with your rich pals? Eva, your mom and dad belong to Ghent's high society. Don't pretend. This is your world. What's the intern doing here? Apparently, she does understand how it works. Networking, sweetie. Networking. It'll be the third time that I cover for you this month. -I wouldn't ask if it wasn't necessary. -Yes, alright. I'll interview those retarded soccer fans. -Thanks, you're a sweetheart. -Yeah. But it's the last time. Viewers think the show is old-fashioned. So you are losing young audiences. The central message should be: We don't cover hot news, we are hot news. Here you can see the new studio. There will be big screens everywhere. And we expect everyone to contribute. Find strong imagery, for all coverage. -More sensation? -We have to stay in the game. If something explodes on Twitter just before we go on air we should have an item about it. Exactly. And everything should feel more dynamic. We're considering a presenting duo. We're already looking for a co-anchor. Right, Herman? -You said in a few years. -Yes, but the ratings are a problem. -It's now or never, Herman. -Have you got a new Verbeeck on hand? -Where is he, this new Herman Verbeeck? -It doesn't have to be a Herman Verbeeck. If I don't present it, the ratings will drop. We've talked about this, Herman. -The ratings have been dropping for years. -We're still number one. You'll still be the lead anchor. You'll get all the important topics. It will still be the Herman Verbeeck show. It's just getting a fresh coat of paint. -How's it going, man? -Lahbib. -Everything's fine. -Long time, no see. Come in, come in. Who's that? That's Eva, she's making a documentary about BX. Pleased to meet you. I'm the star. Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp. -There's freestyle later on. -I don't know, man. Come on. -No, sorry. -See you. Neurotic worker, come close Look at the rich guy dying of an overdose It's time to stop being pushed around Stir your conscience The world's in meltdown You want to be here Come on, go, go. Give it gas, give it gas. No one? Hi everyone, how's it going? It's been a while, but we're still here Let them talk You and I know We move forward, in small steps What have we got? Our childhood dreams I've cried, prayed on my knees Handcuffed to the pillar The street is no movie And I did not want this role Between the deal, or death and prison I took care of my own You think it's easy at 16? To be your own parent? I had a lot to handle I wound up in a bad business To each his own method of healing Weed saved me My eyes can testify When my smile breaks We light up a fresh joint Tonight we party Pick up your joint, brother Tonight we party Pick up your joint, brother Tonight we party The police. The police can go to hell. -Thanks for a great evening. -No worries. We could have an afterparty at my place. No. That wouldn't be very professional of me. I'm just kidding. Right… I'm off. Have a good night. Take it or leave it, Herman. We'll see about that. -The whole board is behind the plan. -Peter, you're lying. We're making a loss. The big advertisers don't want to be near your show. Either the ratings start going up, or it's over for you. How long since your last real scoop? How long since you were enough to make people turn on their TV… and you were in all the papers the next day? I think a co-anchor is an elegant way to bow out. Stay on for one more season. And then we'll make a program by, with, and about Herman Verbeeck. Over my dead body. You owe me, remember? You're an angel. When my documentary is finished, I'll give you a credit. A credit? I was thinking maybe a dinner. It was worth a try. Too much partying with the fans? That was a bad report. You don't just let a bunch of drunks shoot their mouths off. -Sorry. -I don't want to hear it, Eva. Your last few stories have been sloppy. This is not a regional channel. -And I have to present that crap. -You looked like you were smelling crap. -Shut up, Mitch. -Sorry. Either you do your job, or you're fired. That goes for everybody. Do your job, or you're fired. So… What have we got so far? Oh, man. I'm so glad to be going home. Yeah. A retirement home doesn't exactly lift your spirits. -I think Eva is hot. -Definitely. Absolutely. -I wouldn't mind giving her one. -You'd give anything one. -I'd record the sound. -I'll film it. I still need to shoot some stuff in those neighborhoods. Now. -Now? -I thought the subject was done with? I've arranged to meet that police woman. We'll get to ride in police cars. Hurray. -Herman gave us the okay. -Great. -And Peter? -Come on, guys. It'll be interesting. Eva, it's fine by me. I just don't want any problems afterwards. -Please? -Aren't you a bit obsessed? Can I have a light? -Alright, I can't say no to those eyes. -You're so easy, man. Me too? Okay. Cut it out, man. Get back. Let me in. Slut. No, I'm coming in. Ma'am, please be quiet. We are on standby for the raid. Police. Don't move. -Okay, goodbye. -Goodbye. -Sure you won't join us? -No, thanks. Eva lives on love. Oh… Lahbibi. Come on. Did you film some good stuff? -Yes, it was very interesting. -I'm on a 30-minute break. Coffee? -Okay. -Come on, I know a place. -How come Lahbib has such a reputation? -He's a legend to a lot of kids. -What did he do? -He broke into a police station. The one at Vilvoorde. Lahbib knew there was a safe with confiscated items. Dirty money, drugs, guns. One night, he went there with three friends. There weren't many officers there that night. Not enough for four armed men. Lahbib and his friends quickly overpowered the officers. When they found the safe, they needed a code. None of the officers knew it. They tried to break open the safe. It didn't work. They then fetched an electric saw. The officers were threatened the entire time. They managed to open the safe with the saw. Total loot? Almost nothing. They took what they could and ran off. Kids worship a guy brave enough to attack a police station. The police were furious. Catching them became personal. Rolling a joint is like making love to a woman. You treat it like a delicacy with limited pleasure. Slowly, you mix it all together. You lick and roll tightly. And after that, the flame will take you to paradise. How long did he go to prison for? He was sentenced to five years, and did three and a half. He seems so nice. I can't believe he was like that. He has a good hart. He wouldn't hurt a child, or a woman. But back then he was one of the most dangerous guys in Brussels. -Do you think he's changed? Or can't he? -It's hard to tell. I believe he's good at heart. So yes, but… You can never know for sure. -Eva speaking. -It's me. Come back to the car. They've smashed our window. -I'm calling in a theft. -Goddammit, I don't believe it. What the hell are they going to do with a fucking boom? -I'm off, my colleagues will take over. -Thank you. I told you to keep an eye on your stuff. In this neighborhood, with those guys… -How do you know it was them? -Who else would do this, Eva? Those two Danish guys over there? We were asking for it here. I thought you had permission to film here? Or did you pay 100 euros for nothing? Drive round with cops, and that's what you get. Maybe this was your loverboy's work? -Damn it. -The insurance will cover it. It happened while we were on the job. Right? Eva. -Can't we keep this to ourselves? -What? You're kidding. What will I use to record sound tomorrow? My dick? You'll have to come clean. What the hell were you doing in Brussels? You waste my resources use my employees, and what for? I told you I wasn't done yet. You don't get to decide when it's done. You have to do as you're told. But you gave me the job. The job was to spend a week getting some imagery for a short segment. You've now spent more than a month on some stupid documentary. Sorry if my determination is a problem. If everyone were like me you wouldn't have to worry about your ratings. Being motivated and being obsessed aren't the same. Or did your parents spoil you so much that you think you can do what you like? -What do you know? -I can see right through you. You'll use anyone to get what you want. Only one person matters to you, and that's Eva Hendrickx. You let nothing stand in your way. Did Peter put you up to this? Because he doesn't have the balls? I'm at the top of the mountain. I can help you climb it, or push you off. Don't forget that. -Are you ready? -Yes. -Hey. -What? Can you start it and then leave the room? It's personal. Lahbib, don't let me put you off. Just do your thing. Come on, do me this favor, please. Okay, I'll push the button and then I'll go to my office. Thank you. -At the station itself? -The police officer was checking IDs. -When did it happen? Come with us. -Ten minutes ago. -Is he still alive? -Barely. I want all available info on the shooting. What happened before it, any passengers, witnesses. Everything. Listen up. We're going live in 5 minutes. What have we got? Some commuters saw the shooter. They say he was Moroccan. -Official statement? -North African guy. -Commuters know what Moroccans look like? -It's unlikely it was Cubans, Karim. Do all witnesses say the same? No. A cab driver says he was Eastern European, Bulgarian. -The cab driver's nationality? -Belgian. -Abel Kaber. -Of course. They cover for each other. What is the cop's prognosis? He's critical. Doctors aren't sure he'll make it. This is just in. It's still to be confirmed but in 30 minutes every news team will have this. If I show you this, what do you think? The first image that comes to mind following a crime. -That's a Moroccan, right Karim? -Why am I suddenly the expert? Can you tell the difference between a German and a Swiss guy? -I'm a fucking Tunisian, okay? -North African. -It's okay to say that, right? -Does it matter? It's just more oil on the fire. -How many commuters saw it happen? -Eight. Karim, I'm not saying he's Moroccan. But eight eyewitnesses say he looked like one. -The official statement confirms it. -Based on what the commuters said. -Not necessarily a reliable source. -It's worthless. The justice department is more trustworthy than some cab driver. Someone else will run with the news, and say the shooter was North African. We can't hold back information because we're cowards. But it's much worse if it turns out the information is wrong. -Are you sure about it? -100%. We'll forget about the cab driver. Let's say the justice department is looking for a man of North African extraction. -But that we're waiting for confirmation. -Okay. Come on, let's get to work. Silence. Five seconds. Good evening. Tensions are rising following the murder of a police officer. Shots were fired at a policeman. -Violence against cops increases. -Police officers being attacked. Aggression towards police. … aggravated assault and battery… Violence against police officers has increased in recent years. Zero tolerance has been introduced. Youths of Moroccan extraction are regularly stopped and arrested. The police are extra vigilant. Distrust is on the increase. Clashes between the police and teenage immigrants. The situation in Brussels' neigborhoods is explosive. The future of these neighborhoods is worrying. There is a grim atmosphere on the streets of Brussels. They are overdoing it. It's several times a day. It really pisses me off. Shall we go see what's happening? So… Who stole the handbag? If no one talks I'm arresting you all. Was it your friend who did it? -Was it your buddy? -We're innocent. Yes, yes, it's always the same thing. You've never done anything. Do your parents know where you are? I asked you a question. -Do your parents-- -It's easy with 13- or 14-year-old kids. Stop filming. I don't think I asked for your help, sir. You're just a wimp who's acting the big man. Shut up or I'll arrest you too. How? You can barely handle those kids. What's the matter? Am I getting on your nerves? I can see I am. You don't have the guts. -Step back, please. -For you? Let go. Eva. Are you okay? Eva. You're bleeding. -Hi. -Hi. That looks rough. Where did you shoot it? Somewhere in Molenbeek. That's from today. We have footage of that? I have footage of it for my documentary. Look at that guy. You can see right away that he's a thug. You need to know the context. I'll leave you to it. Yesterday, Molenbeek looked like a battlefield again. A short but violent clash took place between police and local youths. We were right in the middle of the action. Take a look. New disturbances in Molenbeek. What should have been a routine check turned into… You went behind my back and stole my footage. Was that your footage? It was shot in Molenbeek, I sent you to the coast. -You can't do that. -I can do what I want. You shot that footage behind our backs on company time. I can do what I want with it. Be glad you're not fired. -Do you know what that footage cost me? -Yes. It's written all over your face. -Who stole that footage? -It doesn't matter. I bet it was that slut of an intern. I bet you'll hire her now. Eva, everything is chill. And you're being difficult. -Why don't you fire me then? -You've got 48 hours. Two days. Not a minute or second longer. To finish your documentary and show it to me. If you don't, not only will I fire you but I will personally ensure that every news team every production company, and every channel will know your name. You can have all the talent in the world but for the next ten years you'll just be putting your stuff on YouTube. Old bastards can be pitbulls too. You better pray I never make it. Because if I do, I'll make sure you don't. Damn, it's my jacket. Hold this for a second. Give me that. Is this some kind of joke? Well done. Fucking hell. Lahbib, look at that ass, brother. I swear on my mother's head, I'm going to marry that girl. Lahbib, she's over there, look. She looked at me, I'm in love. I'm in love, damn it. Lahbib. Look at her. I'll seduce her, brother. Lahbib. Did you have a hand in the assault on Patrick? He's in hospital and has lost a testicle. Are there any witnesses? Nobody, right? Listen to me, you bastard. I believed in you because I thought you could change. Not one cop has forgotten what you did. But I knew you weren't an idiot. I thought you would walk the line. The hard part is staying on the line, sticking with it. Who do you think you are? Do you think we respect you because you grew up here? No one trusts you. Do you know why? Because you are a cop. That's why no one talks to you. If you think we respect you, you're naive. As for that paedophile who lost a nut… No one cares. What do you know about him? Got any proof? Something real? You have nothing. You just have rumors. So maybe you just maimed someone for no reason. Can I continue eating, please? We'll meet again. As you wish. Here. -What is it? -It's something I recorded. -Is this our last interview? -Yes. Eva, you film me. I'm from this neighborhood. But at the end of the day you return to your nice home in Ghent. When your documentary is finished, you'll never come back. But that's no big deal. Okay. I only have one question. What's your strongest childhood memory? I never chose this life. But I had my little brothers. But no one else. No family, no parents. How were we going to survive? So we worked for a bigger guy. You do what he tells you. You're not scared of the cops. You're scared of the bigger guys. I sold shit, drugs, even guns. It's easy. You get a package, an address. You deliver the package. You get the money. Quickly and efficiently, like DHL. One day, everything went to shit. I had to get a delivery from a guy, but he had disappeared. My boss thought he was my pal. But I didn't know the guy. They beat me to find out where he was. One day they found him. They held him up in front of me, his face beaten to a pulp. They gave me a gun. I took aim. I closed my eyes. And bang. But I'm sure I didn't kill him. He was still screaming when he was dragged into the other room. But then… The noise stopped. But they were clever. They had my prints on the gun. So I couldn't go to the cops. I can't use this, Lahbib. If I do, you'll get into trouble. Lahbib Farraji, a typical bad boy from Molenbeek. A hardened man who is both feared and respected. An anti-hero who lives according to his own values… and doesn't hesitate to enforce them. In this world there is only one question. If you do the wrong thing for the right reason, is that a good deed? -Hello? -I watched your documentary. -Oh? -Eva, it's… explosive. Congratulations. I mean it. -Thank you. -Sorry for waking you up. -I just wanted to tell you. -That's alright. This is a game changer. Has anyone else seen it yet? -No. -Keep it that way. We're going all out with this story. Everyone has to see it. Is the rest of your footage on the server? -Yes. -Great. -So tell me, this young guy… -Lahbib? What a great character. Amazing. -What's the suit for? -For the premiere on Saturday. -Oh, right… I don't think I'm coming. -You have to come. Eva, that's your world. Not mine. All the more reason. -I don't have a coat for a suit. -It's okay, your normal jacket is perfect. Stop bullshitting me. I can't wear that jacket. No, really, it's excellent. Perfect. Okay, where is it? Can you open the door? I'll miss my train. This is not a stop. It's a red light. -Come on. -No. Go to hell. Superlatives are not out of place tonight. The following documentary shows that we set the benchmark for investigative journalism. No one goes to the lengths we do. Afterwards there will be time for questions, and a surprise. Enjoy it. Lahbib Farraji had a reputation for being one of Brussels' most hardened criminals. He was arrested multiple times for dealing drugs. Eva, you're late. But it's good that you're here. We'll have to be quiet, it has started. Come on. -What happened? What did you do? -I'll explain upstairs. Come on. Come on. What was that about? Eva… Please don't make a scene. What did you do to my documentary? I just improved your documentary a bit. I put the Herman Verbeeck stamp on it. That's all. You're stealing my work. Stealing your work? You work for me. Your scoops are my scoops. Do you know how much effort I put into it? That's not the point. -Yes, it is. -No. You had lost your objectivity. You couldn't step back from your subject. The image you created of that guy… It was just… You left out a lot of good footage. His confession, for instance. That he shot a guy. -You can't not use that. -I promised I wouldn't. Well, I did use it. It's in there now. I took aim. I closed my eyes. And bang. Eva… Come on, you've still got your whole career ahead of you. In the end… …you're just like me. Hello, Eva? I'm here, where are you? Hello, Eva. Are you okay? Eva? Hello? Eva? What's the matter? Calm down, please. Lahbib? -Lahbib, you… -Calm down, tell me what's the matter. -Eva? -You have to help me.
