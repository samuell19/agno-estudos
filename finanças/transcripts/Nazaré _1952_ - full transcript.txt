NAZARE A film by Chico! Chico! We dedicate this film to the humble people of Nazaré, to the mothers who weep their dead sons, to the brides who suffer. To the hardy fishermen who try to earn a living. Nothing you will see is unreal or purely invented, we sought no spectacular effects, fantastic storms or chilling shipwrecks. We look at simple people, see fishermen at their work and the treacherous sea of Nazaré, whose apparent mildness hides the icy claws of death. Cur story could start from many points, but it starts thus... Chico! Our Chico was a great skipper. Even the sea seemed to fear him... But in the end it killed him That's our fate. We never turn our backs on the sea. The sea is death It's also our life, Tonio! - You're not going out to sea, Manata? - Do I have a boat? Wha... what? what about the rest? That boat isn't being used. Talk with Mar Ruim! Do you... do you... knnn... know. I... knn... know! Hey, man, stop jabbering next to me... Who's screeching? We'll do it like this, Manel! Take my boat, but you'll be the only skipper. And if I get a buyer for her, you return her at once. And work hard, hey! Go and God bless you! Go call my brother and get me four other men. Hey Tonto, Manata! We're sailing! Tonto! Tonto! He's just finishing a model boat... Come quickly, man! - Did you find a boat? - Mar Ruim lent his. Today, at the Fish Auction, everybody was talking about it... Zabel, Agua Mansa's woman, she saw Zé on the embankment yesterday. Which Zé? Who do you think? Her son, who went under with the "Redinha". She saw a shadowy figure and asked him what time it was. And he answered, with his eyes fixed on the stars: "It's 3a.m." - And it was. - What did he do then? He crossed the sand and walked into the sea. If only I could see my Chico, tool Go away! Go away! Never come back again, Joao! Grandpa would die of shame. Great crew you got me yes indeed: Sol-a-Barca.. Baila-Sapatos... Ti Tocha Yes, but I'm still able. I don't fear to stand next to any man. Besides, I need it, Manel! We all need it, Ti Tocha The problem with you is that you don't obey orders. If only you'd take Joao You heard me, go get me a grown-up man! He's got his papers already. He turned 15 on the feast of Our Lady of Nazaré. I won't have his likes by my side. He doesn't have to get a full share! Please, for your children's sake... All right! But if he fails me once Joao! Fine sea we have today A real ladies' delight! I haven't seen Maria da Nazaré today. Sometimes I've no idea where I am, let alone my sister. She's waiting for you outside Why don't you ask about me? I can see you. And I'll say you're a fine sight! Row, my lads make us proud the boat sails on easy on the bow... Here, take your share of money for the catch. You know already why I didn't show up yesterday. You're the skipper of a different crew. I guess the sea will be emptied of fish.. It'll be a tragedy on the beachfront This time, you'll be buying your Winter coat. If you can still fit in another man... I'd like to buy me a Winter coat too. Everybody's talking about it on the beachfront. And they'd make such a lovely couple! Good evening, lad. He's looking handsome, he is! But let's get back to our children, Ti Manel. They're a pair of China dolls. She is a real flower... As for him, there's few about to match him. A hard worker, he is... And such blessed hands! This gift is food for my eyes You can almost smell the sea breeze Their love would be the envy of all Nazaré. Girls swarm around my Tonto like shoals of fish, but Maria is the only sunshine in his eyes. It's none of your business You cannot command the heart God forbid! May Cur Lord of the Afflicted keep me from such things. I never said a word to him, not the tiniest hint. Hope you get better, Ti Manel Bye Joaninho! Don't say a word to Maria! You keep quiet, child; she might turn around. Good night. Estrela - Don't say a word to Maria... - Rest assured! The minute I came in, Ti Manel Peixe-Mau started at once, "Oh Isaura, we ought to see to the wedding of our children. "They're a pair to make the whole beachfront green with envy..." "She's a proper flower Oh Mum, I am tired "Your Tonio ought to be skipper of a trawler, "or even captain of the harbour!” Did he say that? May I be blind if he didn't! Se I said to him "Ti Manel, don't meddle in such things!" "You cannot commend.." No, how did I say it? It was something like Well, you get the gist, Tonto! Don't sleep on the job, or some other man will step in and catch her first. I hadn't noticed you! Do you know what everybody's saying about us? No. That we often talk So, we're not dumb, are we? That's not it, Maria! They say we are dating... Let them talk! I couldn't care less Maria! Did you hear me? I heard you, but I've gone deaf! Try to do better, Manata! Didn't you store water in your warehouse? This was the best fortnight in four months, yet you fished less than the other crews. We need new nets, Ti Augusto So he blames it on the nets. Your crew is like an old age home. Did he scold you? Do you still want to start building a home for us? Come Summer, we can rent it out to tourists... It would be a help, Manel! Hey, everyone! The skipper is coming to settle our wages. Mar Ruim is not happy - Shall we wait for them by the river? - Estrela won't even look at me.. Well, women are like fish. You must go after them! You can't catch fish without a net, Tonio! Take a look at my face! It was carved with an axe! - Don't look, Estrela. - It's two of them. Two? One is Tonto the wimp. The other Torcido... Oh girl! I really drew a bad card! I don't want him carrying my laundry! Estrela! Come on, child Why aren't you dancing? Have some fun... Come here, Estrela Quickly! Say it from there, Grandpa Why are you crying, Estrela? Maria da Nazaré... She will come and stay with us. And he'll come too, Grandfather! Don't you want me to help, Estrela? Have I offended you in any way? I don't like it when you ogle me that way. It's like you want to eat me... There are no other eyes here... You don't say Lying there on my bed, I feel like I'm not of this world... I can't even hear the sea. Do you like the sea, Grandpa? I wish I could tell you I like it and I don't! But we have no choice Hunger drives us that way, and the sea gives us all we have Ti Tocha says the sea is fiercer nowadays. So it seems In my time, fish were raised during the day to die at night. The sea was a garden of fish. Tell us again how the gallion was wrecked... You know the story better than | You've heard it so many times! But I like the way you tell it, Grandpa. The sea was flat when the gallion of Zé Louro Velho set out to fish... Estrela! - Did you say something to Torcido? - What if I did? I think you ought to treat him better He's a fine fisherman. So what? He'd be a fine husband for you. Listen Tonto! Mind your own business. The day my eyes draw me to someone, I know well what I must do. Antonio didn't mean to offend you! Yes, yes, Grandpa As you keep saying, we cannot command the heart. Do you intend to stay a spinster? It wouldn't be the first time it happens on the beachfront. There's more women than men! She doesn't know what she's saying But I know what I must do... and I know what pleases me. Just because I'm small Come on, Grandfather, tell us the story! Not now! It's almost noon, and you'd better go down to the seaside. Estrela, listen to me! I know now that you regret being small. Do you remember your grandmother? She was a small woman, too, yet she filled the house Don't worry! What really counts is having a big heart. And if you don't like the boy, you're right to put him off! This miserable catch is all you managed? The fish are running scarce in our waters, Ti Augusto. The drag nets are taking all of it. Why don't you fire your crew? Get other men! You have only one or two worth their salt; the rest are scum! I said so the other day, and you know I stick to my word! I'm not keen on damaging nets and boat in lousy fishing trips like this. The fish shun the net, Ti Augusto What's that got to do with me? I don't need this... But we depend on it Am I the fishermen's daddy? Your brother is useless... the others are sickly. Ti Tocha can barely row anymore Don't waste my time. We must work harder Mar Ruim is right in a way Other crews catch more fish, so, If the fish is there for the others, then there's no shortage if we set out to get it. Not everybody has the same luck, Manel! Luck is for whoever works for it And we'll find ours yet... We have enough stone for one wall already. What wall? For our home, Manel! What we need Is a boat. And fish A home! She can't think of anything else! Once a beach girl gets an idea in her head, we've had it. Don't be so, Manel! Are you saying I'm wrong? I say fishermen should not have a wife. Then you wouldn't be in this world. Don't talk nonsense! Tomorrow, we'll throw all the stone into the sea. May I, Ti Augusto? Any news? We'd like a word with you If you've come about the boat, I'd rather leave it dry on the beach. There have been a few nice catches But have you found a new crew yet? Ti Augusto, you know the problem is not the crew... You're blaming the boat or the nets? The sea rules, uncle Augusto When it won't give I'll never skip a boat again! I'll be a man no more If we don't catch more fish today than any other crew! All right, take it! But don't get over your heads! You guys are all or nothing Either you loaf on the beach watching the sea, or you want to fish it dry. What's on your mind, Manel? I want to show them that our crew is the best of them all. Head for land, Manel! You've killed us all, Manel! No one stops rowing! It's life or death now! Rescue boat! This is the weather report. Weather expected at the coast until tomorrow afternoon... Overcast sky, scattered heavy clouds, westerly wind with occasional gales. Showers and possible storms. State of the sea: heavy waves from west and northwest. Fishermen must not go out to sea I repeat. they must not go out to sea 600,000 in these lottery tickets. The draw is tomorrow! "Pawn Shop" 500,000 in these lottery tickets You could go down to the beach. I don't feel like it You could fetch Maria. She would love that. But I don't want to. Why aren't you making model boats? I'm sick and tired of boats I've gone off such things Have you had your massage yet? Forget it Wait till you guys go out to sea again. We have time. No money to be made now! Have you been to sea? No, it's rough! Not even with a tow net? "Pawn Shop" Do not go out to sea. Tonto - What is it, Estrela? - Nothing, Grandad. Who's there? It's Antonio. And Maria da Nazaré? She hasn't arrived yet. Is he in a bad state again? Beware of men when they're not going out to sea, my child! He is Maria's man! Yes, but you fancied him once Why aren't you showing up at the beach? I've been sick Sick, you? You spend every day at the tavern! None of your business! I'm a married man; I don't need your advice. I'd say otherwise. You're wasting your life! Show up at the pier tomorrow. We must be ready to put out at the first sign of fair weather. Some crews have been out already They fished little, but you can never give up. See you, then? I'm not coming! I'll never go to sea again! Tomorrow ['ll announce it on the street, for everyone to hear. You're not well, son No, I'm not. Haven't you got it yet? But don't tell anyone, Tonio! Don't. It only makes it worse. I want you to be always by my side Nearly all men in our family died at sea. Your Grandfather. Your father... And our Chico Do you remember Chico? Where is Tonto? He is sick! That's precisely why I want to talk with you guys. Let's see if Mar Ruim will lend us the boat. Since Antonio cannot come, the crew can be smaller. I'll take only six men, so I can offer two more shares for the boat and the nets. That way, perhaps he'll lend them to us. We can draw to see who's out. This is not a game I'll stay out, Manel... Don't be silly! I've already applied to join a codfish ship. They will call me soon. How do we stand, then? We'll go as a six-man crew. My brother is sick. All right, you deserve it Go with God. Maria da Nazaré, isn't your man going out to sea? He is sick And he's looking for a cure in pubs. Great treatment... I asked him to stay back So, you put down the rules. Nice. And who pays the bills? You, of course. Why don't you admit what everybody knows, that he knew fear that day, and he is not a fisherman anymore. You think I don't know them? Well, Ti Augusto never went to sea... What do you mean? I mean that you never went to seal I've already eaten, at the pub. Are you coming home late? I don't know, Tonto! You could come along with me No! Ge alone I'm not good company today! - See you later! - Bye! If you're talking about me, you could at least say it out loud... Listen, Tonto! You're wrong about me. I was never afraid to speak. Why don't you finish, Ti Manel? Speak your mind, come on. I know men well I know that within each one, there's all kinds of things. All kinds! We'll have fish tonight If only you wanted it... All I want is that you let me do my job. Just stop it! - Why won't you hear what I say? - My job is not to hear you. Then you might let me kiss you, and you could have anything you wanted. I'd have no shame... And that's worth more than anything else! Do you owe respect to a man who will not work? As much as your wife.. since you do nothing, either. Maria da Nazaré is coming with me Ti Augusto, I know you won't deny the boat to Manel because of this... It would be bad for everybody! Th... that's what you call talking! I was the first, Jaquim! You, Manata? Never! You're a crazy woman! I shan't be long, Grandpa! If you need anything, call Antonio. Don't you like him? I don't like to see him close to you Anyone who heard you, might think... Yes, yes... I was a young man once... Do you get me, now? And you remember what you did in your bad old days... You're a naughty man! Antonio! Antonio! How did you fall, Grandfather? I've no idea. I think the bed turned over... - That can't be. - I don't know how it happened. Do you think I'd throw myself on the ground? I'm not mad! What are you laughing at? I want a boy If it's not a boy, you'll have to keep making them until there's one. I 'want a great-grandson at my side I must stop this idleness. There's a vacancy for ground crew in Peixe-Aranha's trawler. It's not the same as being a fisherman... But it's work, Tonio! You're right! What matters is starting again. Ground crew is for the old and sick, but it's better than vagrancy! And someday, I'll be myself again! - I've always known it. Anyone who sees him on land would bet high on him... It's a shame he does not go out to sea. - What does Tonto say? - Not a word... - He's been all burnt inside... - But he's better now. These past few months, since I broke the news to him, I saw a change in him We can help him in many ways My man never mentions our home. He knows we can't have one. I know it, too. But if we at least talk about things, we feel closer to them. And someday... someday, we might get a little money to start something; after that, it's easy! Who taught you? Them... You should be in bed already! I feel well. I give the orders here You don't take off your hat to such a pittance! It's hardly worth raising your hand for it. Hey guys, come here! We have one more man in the crew. Oh Tonio! Give us a hug There's big news in the crew: Gagau can speak properly now. Well, he can't talk, but he sings it Be... be... before I... We go... go... got it, man! I went out already, skipper! Big deal, me tool! I won't grow taller... I can't have a license... Today Is the happiest day of my life Even happier than my wedding day Go. Manel doesn't like to wait I want a boy, ok? A boy who'll go to sea. Go with God, Tonto! The sea is flat, but there's plenty of fish about! I wonder if the boy is born yet Hey Manata! Let's make land. We have plenty of time Tonto is back for sure. There's many boats still out! These women scream for nothing! What are you doing, Maria? Damn my old legs! Help us, Virgin of Nazaré!
