Yeah, let's get her. - Come on, let's go! Come on, it's Ace over there! No! Come on! Come on, Terry! Come on. No! - Come on! Let's get him! - Yeah, come on! I can't do it! Terry? Hello, Thelma. Oh my god! They let you out! Gonna let me in? Well, why didn't you let me know? I would have picked you up. I wanted to surprise you. Surprise me? Yes. Yes. I just got up. Well, let me look at you. Oh, I can't believe you're home. I sure did miss you, Terry. I missed you too, Thelma. You're thin. You're awful thin. Are you hungry? I had something earlier. Oh, yes. Yes, well, I guess you're tired, hm? Well, come on. Come on, you come on upstairs and rest, and I'll make us something scrumptious for lunch. All right. Terry? You want some chocolate milk? You know, Terry, if I were you, I wouldn't tell anybody where you've been. I won't. Oh. Of course, I suppose a lot of people suspect. But I told everybody I know you've been away in the peace corps. Don't you, don't you think that's best? Hmm, fine. Honey, don't eat so fast. 1 can't help it, it's so good. Oh. Two whole years. You were only 19. There's been a lot of changes. Mm, that lousy lawyer. Changes all over the place. I told you to stay away from her. For instance, uh, the telephone booths. But you wouldn't listen to me. They, uh, they all look like, um, hair dryers now. What? Nothing. Oh, so much time lost. You could have made something with yourself, you know. With your songs. Maybe I'll write one about that shitty lawyer. I know you didn't touch that Tina. The other boys you were with, yes, but not you. You didn't touch her, did you? I told you before she lied. Tina. I hate that name. I wish she was dead. Now I wonder who that can be. Yes? - Hi, remember me? Lori Davis? I looked at the room yesterday. Oh, yes, I remember. Well, I'll take it. - I don't know, we... Oh, I hope you haven't rented it. It's $15 a week, $58.50 by the month, in advance. I'll pay by the week. Come on, penny, move your bod. Would you mind if I looked at it once more? Well, it's yours now, honey. Oh, excuse me. Go put your clothes on. Hm! Where you from? Tucson. - Oh, Arizona, huh? Mhm. What'd you come here for? I have this friend who's a photographer, and he has this great connection with a modeling agency here in town. A modeling agency? Mhm. You mean, you wanna be a model? Mhm. You realize the competition you got? Oh, yes. But people tell me I have a very interesting face. Interesting, huh? Yeah, well, that's what they say when they don't say pretty. Now I usually only rent to elderly ladies, mhm. And no noise, hm? And no ball, um, entertaining after 10:00. Right, thank you. Don't you want your keys? Oh, yes. Thank you. And remember, you can't use the pool after nine o'clock. All right. - No. And no pets are allowed. I'm the only one allowed here to have pets. Uh-huh. Thank you, bye bye. - Okay. People tell me I have an interesting face. Oh. Give her one week. She'll end up with some phony dude by then. Want some bacon and eggs? Yeah, and some, uh... Chocolate milk, I know. Here you are, baby girl. I gotta get me a better guitar. Keep away from her, Terry. Who, Thelma? I saw the way you looked at her. And I wish you'd call me mom. I was just looking. - Mhm? Well, that's what you did the last time. And you spent two years in a cell for it. No, they're no good these days. Just tacky whores, sleeping around with everybody. You're much too good for 'em. Hey. Have I ever steered you wrong? No. We're just the two musketeers, aren't we? Yeah, the two musketeers. Gimme a kiss. Well, that wasn't much of a kiss. That's better. Hey, is Mrs. orland still renting? Oh, yes, she's still in room five. We're all filled up now, except for room one. Room one, isn't that Mrs. Reeves' room? What happened to good old Mrs. Reeves? Didn't I write you? No. You didn't tell me a thing about Mrs. Reeves. Oh. Well, Mrs. Reeves died of a coronary. No. Hm, so help me. She was at this market, see. Yeah? She was buying some frozen fish. You know how she was crazy about any kind of fish. Well, she was in this market and she had this attack, and she fell! She fell into the deep freeze, right onto the frozen fish! No! A frozen stiff! Yeah! They're at it again. They're having fun. It's unnatural, mother and son behaving like that. It's also irritating. Poor woman's been alone so long. Oh, that's no excuse. She's just glad to have him back. Cackling laughter at all hours of the night? Don't you hear it from your room? It doesn't bother me, father. It bothers me. Where are my glasses? You're wearing them. Oh, heh. Idiots, that's what they are. Stupid idiots. Just low-class idiots. Don't upset yourself, father. Well, you remember what he did, don't you? Now you're going to tell me all over again how he... Set the house on fire? Well, he did. The boy's a psychopath. That's just your opinion. Don't you contradict me. They should have kept him in prison. That's where he belongs. I don't feel safe with that boy around. And don't you ever go near him, do you hear me? I'm not afraid of him. Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Oh, that's wonderful. Alms? Alms for the poor? All right, prize fighter now. Come on, do. Put 'em up. Put 'em up, come on, come on. Come on. Good, good. Toro. Yah! Okay. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Watch! All right, Charlie. Do it. Oh, shit! Oh, Terry. You wanna see something terrific? Pretty good. What do you mean, pretty good? It's damn good. I didn't spend two years taking pictures of drugs in that tacky nightclub for nothing. You think you got enough of me now? Never enough, baby. Never enough. Damn good. Hello? Tina? Yeah? You still as pretty? Who is this? You still do it under the pier? Hm? Is this Barry? No. - Donald? Yeah, Donald. No, you're wrong again. I know. Bob. You know what I would like to do to you? Would you like me to tell you, Tina? Talk is cheap. Well, you just take care of that gorgeous body of yours, okay? Hey, come on, who is this? You just take care of yourself. I wouldn't wanna see anything happen to you. Like what? Just take care of yourself, okay? Who was that, baby? Don't know. Here, baby. Come on. Here we go, sweetheart. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Here we go. That's a baby. Penny? Kitty-cat? Penny? Where is she? Penny? Din-din! Kitty, kitty! Kitty? Haven't seen her all day. Well... Bon appetit! Oh! My god! Penny? Oh! Oh! Hi! My name's Lori Davis. And your name is? My name is Terry. Sun's great, isn't it? Hello, Terry. Hello, Mrs. orland. Say, what else do you do besides clean pools? Nothing. Oh, come on, you must do something. I write songs. Oh, really? How long have you been doing that? About seven years. My, my, bet you must be tired. Hey! Loosen up! Listen! You stay away from him, do you hear? Look at you, showing everything you got. He did this! It's your fault! I saw you leading him on like a cheap whore. Now you stay away from him, do you hear me? You're tacky! Plain old tacky! Tacky! Hello, Terry. Hello, Mrs. orland. Oh, Terry, I think there's a mouse in my room. [, I hear odd noises all the time, and I, I don't... Well, I'll take care of it for you, Mrs. orland. You're such a good boy. Real good. I wish all the boys were like you. He's dead. How? I don't know yet. Laura, check all passengers. She if she's alive. Could he have had a heart attack? He seemed perfectly well last night. Can I have the car tonight, Thelma? Keys are there. That's a groovy way to start your diet. Tomorrow. Bring back some more popcorn, will you, when you come home? J last defense is jump on the pony j jump on the pony and ride j ride, and ride J back in the saddle, and the rising sun J it won't be long till you'll be there j she will hear him say, hey hey j last j jump on the pony and ride j if it stares you down and it scares you j and ride J and it won't be long j till you'll be there, she won't hear him say j hey hey j last defense is jump on the pony j jump on the pony and ride (car engine revving Son of a bitch! A talking bird? Well, I'll be a son of a bitch. What is it? Amyna. A what? Amyna. Well, there's nothing minor about her. It's not a her, it's a him. Its name is blackie. Blackie. Just a little present for you, Thelma. A present? Think of the cats. Blackie's for din-din. I got him for you because you lost penny. Oh. That's sweet, honey. Down and take your bath, come on. Bath? Oh, somebody. Okay, I'll be back. Oh, Terry, come in! Mrs. orland? I thought I'd, uh... Uh... Try and catch that mouse. Oh, yes, yes, I, I just heard it a few minutes ago. Who is this? Me, when I was a young girl. There he is! Did you see it? - Yeah, I saw it. Oh, there it is! Get it! That's not a mouse, it's a rat, Mrs. orland. He's a big fella. Oh, it's so ugly. - Nah, he's cute. Now, you ever seen one of these traps work, Mrs. orland? Mm-mm. You see that piece of cheese there? That draws them. They can't resist it. It's like, uh, kids with ice cream. See the way his nose is working like that? He can almost taste that cheese, Mrs. orland. Think we should let him have it? Uh-huh. Sorry about that, Mrs. orland. We repatriated within three days. On the local scene, tragedy struck last night in Malibu canyon when 19-year-old Tina Moore lost control of her car and careened off a cliff. Death was apparently instantaneous as the car burst into flame upon impact. The red-haired miss Moore, a resident of the beach area... Looks like you got your wish, Thelma. Louise? Louise! What are you doing? Reading? You left me all by myself to watch TV. It was a rerun. I'd already seen it. What? I'd already seen it. I'm tired, Louise. I'm going to bed. You read too much. It's bad for your eyes. Good night. You looking for somebody? 1, no. I was restless. Though I'd take a walk. Or a swim? Oops. Huh? Mm? Oh, I had one or two. It's freezing. How can you go swimming on a night like this? I like it. There's nobody else around. What's the matter? Matter? Oh, was I staring? Hm. Sorry. So you like to be alone? I'd rather be with somebody I didn't like than to be alone. Have you ever been so bored that it actually made you sick? I mean, sick. I am surrounded by boredom. I work in a library, and I hate it. I have these hallucinations. They're so real! About burning all the books! And sometimes I have this terrific urge to put ground glass in my father's food. No, really. I can almost hear his false teeth grinding on the glass. It must feel wonderful. What? Being raped. I wouldn't have told on you. How old do you think I am? I don't know. Go ahead. Tell me. 357? Right on the nose. Too old? Oh! Look who's up. I couldn't sleep. Well, you won't look good with circles under your eyes. Good enough to go to a movie tonight, huh? Want to? - Yeah. Double horror flick. Mother was a werewolf and Dracula sucks again. Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, honey, come on, I'll get a hickey! Jeez, you could use a shower. I stink, huh? Yeah, you stink. Okay. Put 'em up. What? Put 'em up. Let's go. Come on. Can't fight anyway, you're too wobbly. Oh, what do you mean, too wobbly? Yeah, come on! Come on, come on, come on! Put your Dukes up! Boom, boom, boom! See? Oh, oh, oh, no, no. No. No. Stop it, darling, stop it. I have work to do. Boom, boom! Mrs. Thelma Lee lambert! Hey, where'd you get the missus from, huh? No, come on. Come on, I really want to know. Now, now, now, now. Here, come on. Come on, honey, let me up. You just tacked it on, huh? Now how many times have I told you? Your father died before you were born. You told me that a hundred times. Mhm. I wonder why I keep forgetting it. Now if you want me to go to the movies, I will have to finish. I sure had a lot of uncles when I was a kid. Yes, uncles. There was uncle Joe, and uncle Harry, and uncle Theodore. Uncle Theodore. He left us this great big white elephant of a house, didn't he? Yes, he did. Yeah. It's funny, all those uncles, and I don't have them anymore. Where'd they go, huh? You ask too many questions. Come on, baby. To which I get too few answers. You were some good-looking chick when you were younger. Well, I managed to turn a few heads. 30 years ago? 30 years? What are you talking about? Listen, I have work to do. Go ahead and work! Hey, you know what you're like? You're like this big, heavy pillow over my face, and you're suffocating me. Thelma and her, her bastard son! You fat whore! You're nothing but a fat whore. Just a fat whore. Thelma? Thelma? You still want to go to the movies tonight? What are you doing in here? Hi, are you still afraid of me? I asked you what you're doing in here. My mother said that your shower wasn't working. Yes, but that was three days ago. Well, there's a part I have to pick up at the hardware store. What's that supposed to mean? That it'll be fixed in a couple of days. Hello. Um, about last night? I'm afraid I was slightly inebriated. I said a lot of things that I shouldn't have. It's really not like me to act so childish. I didn't mean those things that I said about my father. Like I said, I, I was drunk. L, hope you don't think I was actually intending to s-s-seduce you. Actually, I, I wasn't... Next time you're stoned, lady, and you don't actually know what you're doing, and you don't actually know that you're horny, and you aren't actually yourself, why don't you just hop into a goddamn cold shower? I hear you strumming that guitar all the time. All the time. But I've never actually heard you play an entire song on it. You say you write songs? Why don't you play me one? Because you can't. And that thing that you hold so close to you, like a woman, you can't even play it. Hello? Hello? Hey, where you going? Going to confession. Oh. Well, be sure to tell the priest you're sorry for not taking me to the movies. We'll be fine tomorrow night. Terry? Yeah, it's me. Well, when did you get out? Uh, Friday a week ago. Two weeks. I don't know. I know it was Friday, though. Well, great. Look, Terry, I was going to call it a night. I tell you what, why don't you come to the office tomorrow and we'll talk? Hey, this is nice. What is it? Really, Terry, I have a very busy day tomorrow, and I... Isn't it funny, miss Benson, how some fag decorator can make it look like you got class? What do you want, Terry? Nothing. Just want to pay my respects to my lawyer. This is for you. I thought you'd want to celebrate my release. Oh. What, you think I, uh? See, there's nothing in it. Oh. Don't spill it. It's expensive. Terry, I know how you must feel. Hey, how do I feel? Well, a little bitter? Yeah. Bitter? Confused? Confused? I certainly understand how you feel. Hey, how come you keep saying that? Because everything was stacked against you. I tried, Terry. I really tried. But the judge was tough. How can a lady judge be tough? I mean, women are supposed to be soft and cuddly, and they smell so sweet and pretty, don't they? She was really sweet, that one. I mean, the way she banged her gavel and the nice way she said she was putting me away for two years. Look, Terry, if it's money you need, why, I can help you out. Why don't you just, um, finish your drink? Well, Terry, it's, it's getting so late. Pick it up. You're too smart to use that, Terry. Pick it up! Come on, pick it up! Drink. I said, drink it! Drink it. Oh! Oh, please. Cheers. Here we are, baby. Come, come. Yes, her didn't feel good today, did her? No. You're gonna get special din-din, yes. There we go. I didn't hear him come in. Well, well, the alley cat returns. What? When'd you sneak in? Just a few minutes ago. Want some chocolate milk? - No, thanks. Where did you go? - All over. There was a good movie on television tonight. Too bad I didn't see most of it. Oh, how come you missed it? Oh, some bum stole poor Mrs. Orland's pension check. Grabbed it right out of her hand at the market. What a lousy thing to do. I can see you! What the hell are you doing? Yes I can! - Get out of here! Come on! Oh, Veronica, you should've seen the look on his face. Hi, baby girl. It was funny. Hello, sweetheart. Honey? Come on in and rub my neck, will you? I have a terrible headache. There's a good girl. Do it. Oh, that's good, baby. I'll never forget the first time you did this. Your little hands were so small I could hardly get them around my neck. Mmm, that's so good. Yes. Mhm. Not so hard, dear. Not, Terry? Terry? It's, it's a little too hard, Terry. Terry. Not so tight! Terry, not so tight! Terry, you're hurting me! Mrs. lambert? Now I really must insist that somebody fix my shower. Tomorrow. That's what you told me last time. Tomorrow. Oh, goo, goo, goo, goo. Isn't he a darling? Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Now what the hell did you do that for? Go away. I paid 10 bucks for this clock. What'd you set the goddamn alarm for, huh? To wake you up, that's why. You said you had to buy some gadget for Lori Davis's shower. You know I hate alarms. Why can't you wake me up nice? You know, tiptoe into the room and say, Terry. Oh, Terry, honey, it's time to get up. Oh, yeah. Terry, honey, Terry, it's time to get your ass out of that bed. Hi, Thelma. Hi, baby, hi. Hey, you mad at me? Huh? Thelma mad? Well, you broke my nice clock. Oh, I'll get you a new one. Oh, sure, with my money. Hey, there's something on your neck over here. What? Oh. You're too much. You're just too much. Too much, huh? Yes, you are, too much. Oh, honey, oh! Come on, now, stop it. Stop it. Go one and get that thingamajig and fix the shower, like you promised. Hey, can you still dance? Well, you've seen the trophies I've won. Remember when you used to teach me? I sure do. Gene Kelly! Ha hal Rita Hayworth! Here we go! Come on, baby. Yeah, baby! Oh! This shirt has had it. What? Nothing. Are you a good boy? Cool it, blackie. You didn't do it, did you? I didn't do what? You know what I'm talking about. Rhea Benson. So that's why you've been so quiet all day. She died in a fire, didn't she? When you left the house that night, you took a bottle of liquor with you. Yeah, well, I was going to meet some of my old friends, and we, we were gonna get drunk together. Hey, you don't think I'd do something like that, do you? What about Tina Moore? Oh, wow. You think I pushed her over a cliff, huh? You answer my questions with questions! You think I'm crazy, don't you? There you go again, another question. Answer me! No, I did not. No, you did not. I believe you. Hey. Do you remember when we used to take the car and go down to the beach? And I'd pack a beautiful lunch. Chicken, chicken, always chicken. That's what you liked, your favorite, chicken. And you remember how you talked me into going on that roller coaster? Oh my god, that roller coaster. I was so scared. I was so scared stiff I almost bit my tongue off. You bought me a Dr. pepper to rinse my mouth out with, you remember? I'll never forget it. You said, here, Thelma, drink this. Don't worry, your tongue will grow back. Are you a good boy? You were 11 years old then. And so sweet. Do you remember when I took you to see that movie, gone with the wind? Oh, and Clark gable. And you begged to see it over and over again, I don't know how many, how many times I took you. You always did like the movies. You get that from me. You get a lot of things from me. And I saw every little league game. And I was the proudest mother on the block, the proudest one. Yep. I always knew you'd amount to something. You're still young, you know. You got plenty of time. Jesus Christ! Hi, fellas. Hi, Thelma. Hi, flo. You still on your diet? I went off mine. Can't help it. I love my own cooking. Say, I hear Terry got out. Bet he looks good, huh? This friend of mine, her son did time in chino, came home fat as a pig. They feed them pretty good there, you know. Seems everybody spends time behind bars these days. Getting to be sort of a status symbol. My son got busted receiving stolen goods. How the hell did he know the stereo was hot? Oh, the money I spent on lawyers. Well, you should know about lawyers. Thelma? Thelma? She forgot her clothes. Never did like this game. I'm tired. I'll go to bed. And tell me about your family and your daughters. I have four sons. - You have four sons? Oh dear! - Good evening, Lori. Good evening, Mrs. orland, Mrs. Rogers. My dear, did you hear what happened to me the other day? Yes, Mrs. orland, you told me. I did? Uh, did you hear what happened to me? No, I didn't. Oh, well... I don't believe it. You're finally fixing my shower. Yeah. She's a bitch, too. Well, I hope it works when you're through. Say, while you're at it, do you think you could take a look at this toilet? What's the matter with the toilet? It flushes by itself. Flushes by itself, huh? Uh-huh. Oh, you wouldn't think that was so funny at four o'clock in the morning. Do you lift weights? No. You think I should? Oh, I don't think so. Not unless you want to look like Mr. America or something. Right. See, you hear it? Didn't believe me, did ya? You know, when I lived in Tucson with my aunt, we had this bathroom, and it was right next to my bedroom. And in the bathroom there was this toilet, and all night long it would drip, drip, drip. So you know what I did? I got myself a radio and I kept it on this all-night music station, where they play music all night long, and I listened to music all night long. Because I couldn't stand that constant drip, drip, drip. Boy, that's enough to drive somebody crazy, don't you think? Look at you, you're all sweaty. Hey, how about a kiss? I neverdiditin a bathtub before. Gimme a kiss. Are you shy? That's sweet. What's the matter, don't I turn you on? You're crazy! No! Somebody help me! No, no! No... Hi, baby. Terry? Blackie. Are you a good boy? Lori? Lori? Lori? Terry. Have you been here all night? Terry, what's wrong? Oh! Oh my Jesus! Oh! Oh! Oh! She told me her parents were dead. No one came here, just that one girlfriend. That girlfriend, she could come back. Mrs. lambert? Hello there. Hello, darling. Speak to me. Where's Thelma? Where's Thelma? Lori? It's me, Mrs. orland. Are you there, dear? A girl like that, all alone in the big city, could easily disappear. There's no reason to connect us with it. We've got to get her outta here. Terry, we've got to get her outta here. Terry? Did you hear me? We gotta get her outta here. Tonight. Tonight, when it's dark. When it's dark. Terry? Now you know what to get. Small u-haul. Yes, and make sure it fastens onto the car properly. We don't want any accidents. And speak to no one, hear? Terry? Oh my god, come right back, okay? I will, Thelma. Terry? I was worried sick. What took you so long? Kinda late for you folks to be hauling trash tonight, ain't it? Um, well, we work days. Okay. That'll be $2. Oh, god! Oh! Operator, may I help you? Operator, get me the police, please. Terry. Terry? I'll get you some chocolate milk. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Terry? Everything's going to be all right. All right? He's got about as much chance as a hobo in hell. Terry. Give me a kiss. Ah. Hey mom? You called me mom. What do you know? Can we go to the beach tomorrow? If it's not raining. I like the rain. It shuts everything out. You always said that, ever since you were a little boy. It was raining when you were born. 4:45 A.M. A son. A son, I had a son. That meant strength and protection, something I'd always needed. You had your first haircut when you were two. Long blond, blond curls. I cried when they cut them. And I cried when you wore your first long pants. And I cried when you went off to summer camp. And then when they took you to the hospital with pneumonia, I cried. But when they took you off to jail... That was the saddest moment of my life. All alone, two whole years. I missed you so much! You sleep, baby. You sleep. Sleep. Nothing's going to hurt you now. Just sleep. Baby. Baby.
