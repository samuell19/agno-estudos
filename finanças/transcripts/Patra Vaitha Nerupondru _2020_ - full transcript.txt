'No birds or animals were harmed during the making of this film' 'All incidents and characters in this film are fictitious, bear no resemblance' Meghna Sundarajan... Greetings, professor Hope you are doing fine Huh, I'm sure you're doing good After all you've been pimping out college girls to those in power and in politics My guy is waiting outside your home... with audio recordings of your calls with your students I don't need your money I want the list of all those to whom you pimped out your students Go get that parcel and check it out Madam! Hello, madam! Bro, the parcel hasn't been delivered yet The delivery guy is disconnecting my calls Seemed like he has something else in his mind I think he is up to something Now, what should I do? Dude, check who is it Who is it? It's Maari Hello A small work. Would you like to take it up? I'm sleeping, chief Get this done and you'll get double pay than usual What does he want? He says he'll double up the pay Fine, tell him we'll do it Okay, chief. Send me the location I'll Whatsapp it to you He said he'll pay up Rs. 20,000! Usually he'll make us toil hard for a mere Rs. 5,000 Must be some rich house Whatever. We'll just do the job and flick some costly items for ourselves Well, as good it may sound, the petty thefts never bothered us much Well, now that we've decided to go for it, let make the best out it. Come on Hey! Careful Siddhu! Hello, sir...

I just heard the news Chief, this looks quite serious Our job there was a different agenda but something else happened What's our fault in this? Just forget it What if only we both get caught? Hear me out carefully I think you're doubting me Turn yourselves in if you guys want I don't have any problem if you rat me out I'll be out within 10 days You both are student. So, think about it Fine, we'll discuss that later. Did you finish the job? Chief, well... You didn't even finish the job? What the heck were you doing? Shouldn't have given you that job! Now, hang up! What do we do now? - Why is he weeping? - It was his friend - Got him in your list? - Already inquired him, sir He owns a construction company it seems Guys who broke in were petty thieves They were trying to steal gadgets like mobile, computer But chickened out and left them The tea shop guy claims that he saw 2 guys Hold on. Wait. The officer will come and update Sir, any information regarding the murder? Sir, day by day such murders are on the increase Sir, just a minute. Please answer me What is the motto behind this murder, sir? Sir, over here. Just a minute Two guys broke in thinking the house was empty The guy tried to stop them and they murdered him We have got proofs and one round of investigation is already over We'll nab the murderers soon Sir, again the usual "Update in 48 hrs" statement? You'll anyway make this murder the headlines And if we crack the case, you'll just print in some corner of the newspaper The murderers will be soon behind the bars - Sir! Sir! Just one more question - We are done here. Leave! It is assumed that 2 murderers reached the crime spot at early morning... and during the tussle that broke out, the thieves murdered the person staying at home As per the police statement The tea shop employee who lived nearby said he witnessed them escaping "I will nab those 2 culprits and make them answer to law" A statement from Thiruvanmiyur police officer, Chezian What? We did it? What's going on? We are trapped and in a soup now! Petty thefts were just fine but you wanted make it big! Now look! Look what Maari pushed us into You! Say something! No Adhi... Something's wrong. Someone else is playing the game Remember the victim's friend? Why would he finish him off, that too over there? First, we must find out at what time he was murdered The police knows only the time of our escape and not the time we broke in We got only one way out of this mess Before police nabs us we must find the real murderer That's again unnecessary! Let's just take some off time and abscond! Stop talking like you're crazy! Do you thing they'll not find us if we abscond? The guy who passed by in bicycle saw us And the inspector claims he has proofs against us A small doubt and you know how the police treats. We went there to steal! On top of all, from the police till media, everyone are smart and aware If, by chance, we get caught... neither can we prove ourselves not guilty nor can we escape In any case the cops will nab us I don't have a good feeling about this. Hereafter, you obey my words! Got it? Let's stay quiet for few days Let's follow that victim's friend If we sense that police are nearing us then we'll rat out Maari Okay, right When he called me... I must have attended his call If I was home... then I should be the one... dead! They could have robbed everything and anything from here... ...but they must not have murdered him None will be spared Doesn't matter who is it, none will be spared Dinesh...what's wrong? Why are you upset? Don't keep thinking about it. Just leave it No, Raadhi! If I was the one dead, do you think my parents would've been quiet? If he had someone, they'd have got him justice at least I am the only one who was there for him His absence makes me realize it, Raadhi Tell me - Dinesh, right? - Yes Didn't you say that only the victim, Sampath and you stayed here? Well sir, he'd be very upset if he's alone. Hence... Oh, I see. And you are? A family friend. We're planning to get married - Where are you from? - Thanjavur, sir Parents have settled in US Since, when are you here It's been 4 years since I bought this house Parents stay here whenever they visit Yearly once What do you do? Buddha construction belongs to my dad We are taking care of it How long since you know the victim, Sampath? We studied together since childhood His parents were farmers They committed suicide When I found that out, I took him in ever since that He completed engineering but somehow he wasn't interested in working in that field He reads a lot and has written a few books too He wanted to become a successful writer Recently he took up a part time job Part time job? Where? I don't know, sir He'd set out saying it is some delivery business Since I didn't like him taking up that job... I didn't inquire much about it Fine, where were you last night? There was a small office party last night I had been to it Do you doubt anyone? I don't have any doubts, sir... I'm sure it was those thieves Okay, Dinesh... Coperate with us. Please come if you summon you Sure, sir Hey! Isn't this Sampath's phone? Hello No, thanks Customer care As of today it's 4 days since Sampath is no more Not even a single call from the office where we worked as delivery boy Thought I'll check his call logs and report But all the calls were web calls Told you no to ponder over it and move on. Forget it! Sir... I did a thorough check. He was at that party the whole night They claim he stepped out for 10 minutes Turns out he was on a video call with is parents, who live abroad Details are here in this pen drive. Apart from these, he's always been in office Sure, sir. - Okay, Saba - Okay, sir - Let's go - Okay, sir - Any update on the autopsy report? - I hear it's ready, sir All the evidences point towards us yet they are following him So, like us, even the police doubts him He has done something. For sure! Sir! The autopsy report says the murderers have executed the perfect crime Doesn't look like newbies - Bharani - Sir Hello There's one delivery to be done. Interested? - No thanks, chief - What happened? We have stopped it I'll ensure that you guys won't face any issue Let me call you back, chief What is it? It was Maari What else would he call us for? Dinesh! What are you up to? Raadhi... someone else came here before the thieves broke in How do you say? As per the autopsy, Sampath died at 11:20 I was with him on that until 9:30 We had been to dinner, as usual That's when he received a call from the company where he works part time Tell me, sir Can I finish my dinner and start in 5 minutes? Okay, sir Dude, an urgent delivery. He's waiting nearby our home Please drop me at home Told you that job sucks and you want me to drop you? - Told you to join my office! - Let me try on my own first If I don't get anything, I shall join Shall we go now? I really don't like you doing this, I'm telling you I was getting late for office party, so I left to pick you up When we were at the party, Sampath had called me at 11 I couldn't attend and then later I returned his call around 11:30 He didn't pick the call and by then he was dead. That's what the autopsy report says too The thieves jumped out of the house at 3:30 The house was in a mess Blood stains on the stairs. They got scared on seeing the corpse and ran away 11:20 to 3:30 Almost 4 hours the broke in to steal but left without anything. So, why'd they come here? If they were not here for money or jewels then what could it be? Sampath used to get regular calls from that delivery company The company must have contacted him in either case, if he's dead or alive I checked his phone logs and all the company calls were web calls Raadhi... definitely someone else came in before the thieves Are web calls traceable? Constable, looks like the inspector is upset He wants us to close the file but not so easy to find the criminals! - After all it's our job - Drats - Sir - Yes? I was travelling in his rickshaw, a bike guy snatched away my mobile Why were so careless? Go file the complaint with the writer Please sit Where are you coming from? Where did the incident happen? How many were there? 1 or 2? Did you notice them? Did you see their bike number? Write down each and every detail What's the case? I was travelling in his rickshaw, a bike guy snatched away my mobile Locality? Thiruvanmiyur Okay, sit - Where in Thiruvanmiyur? - Rajagopalan street Guys who broke in were petty thieves They were trying to steal gadgets like mobile, computer... - Bharani - Sir? Coming, sir - We got the robbery case list, right? - Yes, sir - Get me that - Okay, sir Any update on the autopsy report I asked for? Around what time? Confirm? Well, the victim was my friend. Hence... Okay J-6 station receiving, sir Sir... Professor committed suicide - Reason? - Don't know yet, sir The calls she had with her girl students were tapped and since it leaked... Some files have been burnt down The TV has been running "What you have to do is....like they expect something..." "so to meet those need and get it done successfully...college girls...." "they expect something from college girls like you" "I am doing my.... Like I have never stooped to this level ever" "I can only tell you this much... Like few things..." "and I believe that you too will understand it" "So, they expect something from you" Dinesh, check out this news The PPT professor committed suicide She lives in our locality Back to back deaths under mysterious condition. Are they murder or suicide? Who leaked the professor's call recordings? Who gave the police the rights to expose the details of the girl who spoke to her? Does the situation demand a CBI investigation? Who all will be exposed? Like "murder for political benefit", is "murder for power" starting to rise in Tami Nadu? Today's show of "Let's talk politics" continues with many such questions Answer me this. Why do you keep dragging CBI in to every silly thing? The suicide was due to depression and her ethics failing in her profession The investigation is going smooth Then why drag the CBI? Why are you talking like crazy? Does the opponent party have nothing better to do? Truth must be exposed so it can be either CBI investigation or police investigation I hold the government responsible for the murders No way! There are some high profile people involved as per the audio leaked - Every murder has some high profile links - Don't you add irrelevant names We don't look at every such incident as mere murders It's all trash talk! We look upon it as the murder of democracy All names mentioned in those burnt files at the house... ...of professor who committed suicide... The complete truth must be out! Dude... I doubt Maari He sent us to that house on that day We found a dead guy He came with a new delivery address yesterday And today a professor is dead in that address If we had taken up that job the other day... ...we'd be buried six feet under by now! Adhi... I somehow feel we must take police's help No Raadhi The had executed it so perfect We can't crack it, no matter how much we try My friend, Vishnu, is an ethical hacker How about we get his help? All I hear is murder and suicide. What's going on? - What progress have you made? - Sir, investigation is on We'll nab the culprits soon Yeah, the same old answer! Too much pressure from the top management Our locality has been the hot topic for past 2 months On top of that, don't get me started on media Fine, what's your progress? Doesn't look like the usual gangsters. Looks like some new, inexperienced guys They murdered him, chickened out and left the loot there itself We only found petty electronic items in their bags they left there I've almost zeroed in on them. We'll nab them I'm just waiting for a small loop hole Whatever it is, speed up. I have a meeting today evening Sure, sir Let's go. Drive Sir, our locality robbery case file that you asked for Sir, most of the accused in this file are caught There are few cased that are yet to be solved Few involve students, hence the case has not been registered and left pending Fine, get me those unsolved case files Sir, no stolen goods are flowing in the market like before No idea where the stolen good are now sold off The market is not the same like before, Bharani Digital India. There are websites online to sell stolen goods There are apps competing to sell such goods - You may leave - Okay, sir Raadhi, see here. There is a way We have an option to poke back the web callers If we call back the web number from which we received a call, they'll get a notification They can call us when they notice it - Call that number now - Dinesh, do it Yes! The notification is sent So, if he calls back Sampath after he notices this notification then its normal Your theories could be wrong But if he keeps quiet even after seeing this notification... then something is fishy They we got ourselves a big problem Sir.... Sir, a report of phones sold from our locality, in ALX online The contact numbers of many phones we doubt match the ones in these There are the contacts of buyer and seller in it The contact of a person name 'Siddarth' is frequent I have marked those, sir Okay, sir Hello J-6 inspector, Chezian here I need the complete details of a contact number Tell me, sir "9840508677" I'll collect the details and email it to you, sir Okay, I shall wait Was it him you saw? Sir! That's him! Why is Nisha calling? Hello Adhi, cops just came and left the college in search of you guys Okay The cops are looking for us What? Raadhi! Come here! See, he has received our poke messages He is reading it He has read it for sure It true that we broke into that house But, we didn't murder him How is it that you broke in exactly to the house where murder took place? We did petty thefts for our survival Gadgets like laptops and cell phones of our college students Whatever we loot like that, we sell them in ALX or directly in the market That's where we befriended Maari He started giving us small delivery jobs We did that as a part time job Since he knew us well... On the 23rd, he asked us to steal a blue cover parcel from that house But when we jumped into that house that day... the rear door of that house was open As soon as we broke in... we first stole all that was essential for us Then moved to the next room in search of that parcel But, we saw a corpse there We were shocked and escaped at once And that's when that tea shop guy noticed us We called up Maari to explain what had happened He further scared us Turn yourselves in if you guys want I don't have any problem if you rat me out You both are student. So, think about it When he said that... we were scared to approach the police We saw the headlines next morning and were shocked! What else have you done? Since that incident we stopped everything We tried to find the murderer But we couldn't We didn't have a proper plan So we thought of escaping from here That's when... you caught us Please, our life will be ruined, sir Please, sir Even last week... we were offered Rs. 10,000 to steal a pen drive from the same locality We refused Pen drive? Which locality? Thiruvanmiyur, sir Date? Sir, March 23rd That's when our exams got over Are you sure about the date? Confirm, sir - The pen drive that we got from professor's house - Yes, sir - Bring that - Okay, sir Call him again Again! Again! He received this poke too. He has noticed it Call him again He noticed this one too He is definitely noticing it all but there is no response Then according to you he's definitely got something to do with Sampath's murder - Right time to inform the police - Yeah. Okay Sir, it's me, Dinesh Can we speak. It's important Dinesh, I'm busy with an important work. Come to the station Okay, sir - Do you know Maari's house? - Yes, sir Do you think police would take all these seriously? I don't care. I am not resting until I crack this, Raadhi Raadhi! He gave the parcel to Sampath on that day Follow him! Which one? That rooftop This is Maari's house. He must be on his way from the market Go fast! Go! Go! Dinesh, stop! Wait! Wait! Raadhi, you go to the station. I'll come Fine, do keep me posted Maari! Dude, get him! Arun... Maari is done and dusted Problem's no more Okay Sir... In the middle of the road? Se we have few doubts regarding the accused in Sampath's murder case Moreover, doesn't look like those thieves murdered him Someone else is involved - What do you mean? - Yes, sir Let it remain confidential. Go down and handle things. I'll follow Okay, sir Dinesh! - Saba... - Sir? I had asked for the CCTV footage from the deceased professor's house On process, sir - Get me that immediately - Okay, sir Sir... - Selvam... - Sir? Need the complete call history of this number Okay, sir Sir, mostly web calls and there are also normal numbers Get the id proofs of those numbers Sir, normal numbers are quite easily traceable but... web calls....we can try IP address? We can nab the culprit with IP address but... if he's using it then definitely he'd have used Poptax, Global phone, CG phone Sure he'd have installed IP hacker It's not like before. There are many apps to make fake calls So, it'd be quite tough, sir Sir... We can find the receiver's location Superb Selvam! Can you get a list of all the web calls made in the city? That'd be tough, sir because every telemarketing call is made using web calls - Can it be filtered? - I can try, sir Usual no one attends the spam calls If attended, still the calls won't last for long Do one thing. Any web calls above 5 minutes... - Filter those alone - Yes, sir Sir... the CCTV footage from professor's house is here Sir, the CCTV footage are available on till March 22nd All footage from 23rd is missing. It's completely missing To be exact, sine a week before she committed suicide March 22... Sir... can we locate Sampath's final location before he came home the day he was murdered? Sir, except from Meghna's locality, everyone else are caught Everyone has Maari's name on their lip Sir, they belong to Maari's group The are faking it saying they are delivery boys and just went to deliver Sir, we don't belong to Maari's group. We went to him after seeing an part time job poster He'll give us the package and pay us for delivering. That's it Sir, we delivered all that on Maari's orders Why are you all quiet? Speak up! Sir, I'm a photographer Sir, we both are engineering students Sir, we had to pay our fees hence the part time job I am Maari's neighbour. I work in a fast food outlet He asks me to deliver packages and then pays up. That's all Sir, I'm looking for a job Sir, I'm a cab driver I drive a share auto rickshaw At Avadi You? Sir, I am a mechanic - Remember the addresses you delivered in? - Yes, sir If you just sing the same old "We just know Maari and nothing else", no one is leaving here You better speak up if there is anything else Sir, I was asked to visit the police station for some inquiry There was heavy traffic. Also, I live at Neelangarai You too belonged to Maari's group? - Professor lived at Neelangarai, right? - That bald fellow? - Come here - Sir... Do you know college professor, Meghna's house? No, sir. I don't know whose address it is Usually I'm asked to deliver the parcel or some days to collect I was paid well. That's all, sir I befriended Maari at that auto rickshaw stand over there Sir I delivered in Palavakkam, Kottivakkam, Neelangarai, Kovalam, Thiruvanmiyur etc. Remember all those addresses? I do, sir - Sivaraman - Sir... Tail all the houses they have delivered in - I need all their updates within an hour - Okay, sir Saba... - College all the CCTV footage of those houses and hand it to Selvam - Okay, sir Do you know him? Tell me, Sivaraman Sir, all those addresses point from minister's farm house to Police IG's house Sir, all the address are of powerful people Most of them are politicians Rest of them are government officers Since all of these people are very powerful... CCTV are available Out of all the houses delivered, the least ranked is an assistant of executive magistrate We inquired him but he didn't have any answers I shall bring him sir Okay. Bring him. I'll take care of it Sir... just a moment Sir, this was Sampath's location, an hour before he died Based on that location, he was at the professor's house to deliver something But we don't have the CCTV footage from that day to find out what happened Sir, look... someone has been following all those delivery boys He finds out if the package was delivered successfully and is updating someone I somehow feel that even Maari wasn't aware that this guy was following them Selvam, check if you find a clear image of this guy Forward his photo to all the local stations We must nab him by tonight I'll take care if any problem arises Tell me, Aarmugam. Where was the package from? How much did you pay? 2 months ago. One fine evening around 5... I received a package The package contained... I had once made a deal and got a bribe of 0.5 millions The package had a pen drive containing audio and video of the deal I had made Right away I received a call from an unknown number When I attended it, I understood it was them, who sent me the package I told them I'd give them all of the 0.5 million bribe I received But they refused money Instead they wanted a list of my higher officials who earned more bribe After that I monitored and gave them the list Fine, you may leave Sir, it was a video of my boyfriend and I I don't know how they got their hands on it They started blackmailing me with that video I broke up with my boyfriend but even after that... they blackmailed me and made me attended many parties With some guys in party...I was forced to... Most of them were sons of big shots Few of them were the sons of some ministers They let go of me but now they are torturing those guys who spent time with me They call me every now and then I had did it only once with my boyfriend... but these guys made me... We split the moment I got that package It's been long since I got a call from them My life just got back on track and is going smooth Please, it won't be good if I get involved in a case now I paid them the ransom they demanded Please let me go Minister sent me. It was his son Please don't drag him into this case now when the MP elections are around Minister trying to win a seat for his son in election. He'll be a central minister soon That group was troubling him and we have settled them Tell us what we can do for you and I'll ensure it's done Tell me, Chezian Do you see any loop hole in their statement? It could be one mysterious guy or two or could be a gang Every low ranked to senior most government employees, business tycoons, VIPs, politicians... all their illegal transactions, bribes they collect and their affairs... They collect all these details, place cameras in their bedrooms and record them Then they blackmail them for ransom They are executing a crime in a perfect way When businessmen meet at big hotels to make big deals... using latest technology, for example in boltnuts, bottles or sunglasses... small cameras are installed and videos are recorded Tried to check if these culprits can be caught in CCTV but they hack it and destroy it The details up to the last PA of a minister, his multiple phone numbers, his call logs... They got every single details One of their such victim was the college professor Meghna Sundarajan They blackmailed here with the audio of her calls with her students and demanded ransom She committed suicide realizing it would be shameful if it leaks Moreover, it wasn't those thieves who committed that murder in Thiruvanmiyur These guys did it Sampath, who got murdered, was one among these delivery boys These delivery boys blindly deliver the package without knowing any of it's details They take the money and deliver the package to the mentioned address Knowing the risk if these details leak, they murdered Sampath just like they murdered Maari So, what do you suggest we do now? We are not sure how many lives are lost because of these guys So the only option is to nab them, get their statement and finish them off in an Encounter Then we will do it We'll proceed, sir Hello... - Raadhi... - What happened? The CCTV footage at professor's house is missing from since Sampath went their to deliver Neither that professor nor Sampath are alive now Now, I doubt if it was really Sampath's employer who killed him Let's do it the same way Police targeted the thieves, we found these frauds Now, the police is targetting these frauds I'm sure there is someone else above them! In order to find Sampath's murderer ...
