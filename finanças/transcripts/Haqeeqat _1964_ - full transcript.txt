Are you going to Srinagar? - No, to Ladakh. For the first time? - Yes. How is the place? l don't like it. Are you too going to Ladakh? - Yes. But first l'll go to Srinagar. Will you stay there? - No. As soon as l reach Srinagar, l'll take the air force plane for Ladakh. Why are you so sad, Ramsingh? l took leave to marry. Are you sad due to the wedding, or on being seperated from your wife? l did not get married. Did you fight with the girl's father? No. l had a fight with the girl. lt is an ill-omen to meet the girl before marriage. Why did you come? - l couldn't resist. So impatient? We have all the time after marriage. l have to leave for duty immediately after marriage. But, we will be together. - The wife is not allowed. How long will you be away? - A year and a half. What? You could've extended your leave. - l did. But due to the priest's delay, it got wasted. Then, we could've married only after 1 1/2 years. What? - None of our parents... were keen on this marriage. Now, after convincing them... you are leaving me at their mercy. l don't want to marry now. This marriage will happen now! Or not at all! Fine. Think it over. - l have. Then l'll leave; never to return. - All right. Did you call me? - No. Write to her and she will calm down. Take it easy. This is Ladakh. - Yes, sir. l know you are fond of running, but the oxygen level here is low. One feels breathless, so take care. You've come from Srinagar... and l am going to Srinagar. You came by plane and l'm going by my jeep. Are you going, Sir? - My leave has commenced. l was waiting to introduce to you my CEO before leaving for Srinagar. l am expected there. My heart wants to sing... and abandon these treasures of the heart My heart wants to sing... to shed the treasure of the heart One can not mollify love One can not mollify love And l feel bereft The flame is missing the moth The tears will stop at the mere sight One lover will meet another... to unload the treasure of love My heart wants to sing to abandon the treasures of love On first sight, she will feel shy She will come forward, but will hesitate lnspite of the closeness she will be embarrassed And then will come nearer This is not a game Today someone will abandon the treasure of love My heart wants to spring forth... to unload the treasury of love l will remove strands of hair falling on her face My desire will be ablaze The freedom will torture me Where will l find such peace again? My heart has no other place to go Today, someone will shed the treasure of the heart The heart wants to sing,... to unload the treasure of the heart lf you repeat your mistakes you will be punished. Left, right... About turn! Run! Walk fast. Chest forward, hands at the side. About turn. - l'm tired. And you want to become a soldier! Pick up the rifle! March! Hold the rifle upright. ... about turn! l wonder how long he'll take. - Halt! About turn! Attention! l didn't ask you to relax! Keep the rifle... and walk fast. Halt. Very good! Are you tired? - You nearly killed me. Sorry, sir. l'll give you a reward for it. This is a medal which is awarded to brave people. Am l brave? too? - Yes. And if after wearing this... you do an act of cowardice, l'll take it away. l'll never behave cowardly. - Bravo! But, will l become an officer? - Yes, even better than me. Halt! About turn! The Brigadier has sent for you. Daddy! When did you come? - Get in. My son! Sir, the Brigadier is on his way. - Where is he? With the D.C.P. - All right. l like this Sonamar camp. l decided to meet Bahadur before proceeding to Ladakh. Good. Even we got a chance to meet you. Bahadur, if the Major grants you permission,... do come to Srinagar on Saturday. We'll dine together. l'll go to Ladakh on Sunday and you can return here. Please write to your mother she gets worried. l'll just come, father. - Don't forget to come on Saturday. Let Bahadur undergo hardships. And don't favour him because he is the Brigadier's son. Don't worry. Bahadur is one of our better officers. We have high expectations from him. Why were you standing so long? - Why not? Am l a coward? Forgive me, you're a better officer than me. Okay, you're forgiven. You promised to come to my house. - We'll go tomorrow. Promise? - Sure. Sonu! That's my sister. Help! Come quickly, Sonu! Help! Hurry up! What happened? A lamb? lt's going to die! C'mon... You take too long. A penny for your thoughts! Won't you tell me? Okay... l'll tell you what l've been thinking about. l was thinking that this valley of Sonawar is so beautiful. And all its beauty is captured in your eyes. After you leave, this valley too will seem lovely. Because it's beauty will follow you. And then my eyes will look for you in these mountains. Now, tell me about your thoughts. Nothing. Come on. Mother has sent for you. Sir, l had mentioned to you that a small boy... wants to accompany you to Lamayu. - Oh yes, where is he? There he is. - Over there? Ask him to hurry up. - How'll he go with out his mother? And she is very old. - There is the mother too? Actually the boy's sister is sick, and both were going on horse back. l said you're a kind man; you would drop them. l'm driving a jeep and you want me to take everyone along? l'm sorry for making a commitment without your permission, sir. She's terribly ill, sir. - Okay. lll, eh? What happened? l'll undergo even this for you, Bahadur. Hurry up! Are you going to Srinagar today? - Yes, Sir. Give my regards to the Brigadier. - Yes, Sir. What is your name? - Sonu. ls she your sister? - Yes. What is your name? - Anmo. Nice name! Are you Ladakhis? - Yes, but my mother is a Kashmiri. True, and their father is a Ladakhi. So you are going to Ladakh? - Our first halt is at Namalulu. Our relatives reside there. Then, we'll go to Leh. We own a house there. Then, we'll proceed further to Kohran. Shashur is 200 km from Leh and Kohran is 50 kms from there. Don't you know? His paternal grandpa has a house there. l thought maternal grand father. - That is in Sonamvar. You like Leh or Kohran? - Leh. l'm asking her. - She likes both the places. No? She doesn't like Leh. Not even Kohran. She likes Sonamvar now. Earlier it was not so. But now she likes it. Wow! Their father also always halted here. Where is he? - ln Leh. What's up? You seem pretty cheerful after praying at the temple. lt is God's grace! - l see. Don't you ever talk? - Only when she fights with me. Thanks a lot, sir! lnstead, l'm thankful to you for showing me such a beautiful place. Wasn't a bad journey, l hope? - No. Very well. C'mon, Anmo! Hurry up! Hurry up, l say! When did you arrive, friend? - l've been transferred here. Let's begin our parade. - We'll do it tomorrow. l am so happy to meet you all again. And you? - Me too. How about her? No. She isn't happy. She is! ...Doubly! l couldn't buy anything. - Worry not, l'll buy you everything. First put water in the jeep. - Does your jeep run on water? Okay, here l go. Sit down. You came to Ladakh and my destiny brought me to Ladakh, too. Do you know the reason? Neither do l. Perhaps we are destined to be together. Maybe l'm in the army only so l can be close to you. Maybe we were born to continue our relationship from our previous birth. Now my heart longs to be close to you. l may go someplace far away from here,... and destiny will again draw you to me. And then you will always be with me. l don't know where you come from or where you will go. l don't even know if l should trust you or not. But, l don't want anything other than being close to you. l prayed to meet you again. And God answered my prayers. l'll go again and pray never to be separated from you in life. And if l die, it should be before we part. l'll take you to Delhi. ls it very far? - Yes. ls it a very big city? - Yes. ls it heavily populated? - Yes. Do lights twinkle there? - Yes. Will you take me? - Yes. l'll buy you a lot of clothes and jewellery. Will you wear them? - Yes. l'll take you to meet my mother. She is very nice. Will you meet her? - Yes. l've already filled water twice in the jeep. Anything else? ln fact, we've been waiting for you! Sonam, come tomorrow near that brick shack for the parade. See you tomorrow. - Juley. Juley? What does that mean? When we greet someone or part we say 'Juley'. Well, juley then. The place you have to go in 300 kms from here. lt will take you 3 days by jeep and a day's walk. lt is a difficult journey and you can start tomorrow. There are Chinese posts near our own... on our land. Talks are on between Delhi and Beijing to remove them. We only have to protect our posts. Sir, the boy l trained in Sonamvar,... l spoke of him earlier. - Oh yes! He's coming here tomorrow and he's fond of parade. l'll explain everything to him. - Thank you! You will leave tomorrow morning to command Post No 3. l'll follow you and be at a distance of 5 miles at Post No 1. Did you write to mother? - Yes, l'll mail the letter today. What is it? - Wait, l am coming. l'm leaving! That place isn't for girls. Wait for me, l too am coming! - Hurry up then! Go on, but don't say l'm here. Has that boy come? Sir's calling you. Bahadur's gone very far, they say. He'll surely return... but no one knows when. Attention! About turn! Relax. When did you come to Leh? - A couple of days ago. Where are you going, Major? - l'm going very far. And my friend, Bahadur? - He's with me, too. When will he come? - l don't know. But l'll ask him to meet you when he returns. Give him my love. Everything is all right, Sir. - Okay, you may go. Dear son, may God bless you l guessed from your letter that Ladakh is a ruined paradise,... which a beautiful Ladakhi girl has brought to life lf my son is so fond of her, l am ready to accept her... as my daughter-in-law. All l want is to see you happy Didn't l say that my mother is very nice? She has accepted you as her daughter-in-law. l have to hear foot-steps,... and my heart wonders... if it's him l wonder if it could be him Hidden in the depths of my heart,... From the depths of my heart, as if someone were calling out... and lights the cockles of my heart This is his style l wonder if it is him l see his handsome face everywhere Every fibre of my being is tuned... to his touch which is like a whisper l wonder if it is him l have to hear footsteps and l wonder... l wonder if it is him Chinese and lndians are brothers! Go away from our land. Chinese and lndians are brothers! We don't want to fight with you. But if you don't go away... we'll slaughter you. Chinese and lndians are brothers. Leave our land and go away. We don't want to fight you. But if you don't go away... you'll be slaughtered like lambs! Chinese and lndians are brothers. They are forcing a bond on us. - Very emphatically too! They think the conqueror Chengiz Khan... has left the entire land for them in his wake. l'm fed up with their slogans of brotherhood. l wonder where the government has placed me! You are a new recruit. Who enrolled you in the army? l own acres of land. My elder brothers are in the army. And l tilled the land. One evening when l returned home... Sister-in-law, today your son too has tilled the land. Both my sisters-in-law are very nice. l always wondered at the difference between you. And realised it today. The elder one is sweet and the younger one is impish. Will you ever tease me? - Never! She's bitter! Enough! She's a sweet-meat! Hit him for teasing you. Go on... Before your father died, he wanted you to join the army at the age of 18. Now that you are 18, you must go. The army? He too? lsn't it enough that two of your sons are already there? This poor child has not seen his father since two years. And she's seen her husband only twice since marriage. And when he marries, like us,... his wife too will anxiously wait to see her husband. And you haven't seen your sons since 2 years. Don't send him away. The family will be lonely. He's still a kid. - l'm no kid! l will go! He will go. Take the 5 'O clock train tomorrow. Give this to my husband. And this to him. - Sweetmeats? Good-bye, mom. - Bless you. Here is the sweetmeat and here's that photograph. Today, l am sending both of it to them. My elder brothers are 50 kms away from here. l wrote many letters but received no replies. Everyone here is ridiculing me. Atleast write once. l hope l receive your letter when the mail arrives next. Hurry up and come! Well? Have you received your letter? Well? - Don't pester him! Water. You'll get your letter tomorrow. Watch out. - Sure. The mail has arrived! See how he's running! l wonder if he'll receive his letter. He hasn't received one in 6 weeks, but today he will. l don't think so. - He will. Let's wager for Rs. 5 - Okay. l'm going to recover 5 bucks from you today. So let's go. l left her doorstep thinking,... she would breakdown and pacify me The breeze gently blew her veil l thought she will hold my hand and cajole me Her feet moved so slowly.... as though she would call me back But neither did she stop me nor did she pacify me Nor did she hold my hand, nor did she cajole me She did not call out to me... nor did she call me back l slowly moved ahead and finally got separated from her l finally got separated from her l got separated from her lt's really sad that no one writes to him. He is waiting only for one letter but in vain. Anyway, l won my bet. Aren't you ashamed to gamble on his condition? On the first of every month he wagers bets and wins. And then lends that money to us on interest. He's really ruined me. He must receive his letter. l'm very lucky to have received my son's photograph today. He is so very cute. - He must be grown up now. My younger brother too has joined the army. Two of you in the army? - The third one too. He is posted in Ladakh. 80 miles frome here. The mail is here.. Hurry up! l miss you a lot l've told my wife not to write romantic stuff on a postcard. The postman must be reading all this. l'm knitting a sweater for you To, Cook Chaturam... lt must he from my wife. My dearest Chaturam You are embarrassing me, Parvati. Why did you become a cook? l am sending you a recipe for tandoori chicken. Well done, my wife! l've got the recipe for tandoori chicken. Today, l'll feed you Tandoori chicken! Rubbish! Where'll you get a tandoor from? l've received sweets. - Sweets! Sweets! Hang on guys... relax. - First the sweets. Wars are very unpredictable. Come on, let's eat it. Vir Singh! lnstead of sweets you've received soil. l'll use it to wash the vessels! What is this, feller? Come, l'll read out a part of the letter. l've heard there is no greenery there l'm sending the soil of the plant you so lovingly grew And also the seeds of the flowers you like When the flowers grow, do remember me Well said. You have written that you always remember me as a bride When you return, l'll deck up as a bride But don't repeat what you did 3 days after our marriage What if l leave tomorrow? Not now ... no! ls everything okay? - Yes, Sir. l received a letter from mother. She's great! First she enrolled me in the military... and now wants me to take leave to come home... to get engaged. Everyone's leave is cancelled. Chinese and lndians are brothers! Not again! All day, all night! lt's become difficult to stay here. - What is all this? We are at loggerheads with each other. We both are fighting for ownership of the land. lf the land is really ours, why are they claiming ownership? And that too for a barren land. So what? But the country is ours! - So where is our border then? lt means we are trespassing. - They are here, we too are here. Tell me, whom does it belong to? Can l ask you a question? Have you ever heard of Hindustan attacking another nation? No, sir. Was there a tyrant ever born in our country? Has our country ever tried to conquer another nation? Then, will we break our age old tradition,... to seize someone's barren land,... when we don't even have our army and congas. Our leaders have always advocated peace, and to protect the nation. But what do their leaders advocate, who are endorsing brotherhood? This is a book written by their leader. And it says that those who don't conform to us are not our friends And those who are not our friends are our enemies And their forces will rest only after killing their enemies We don't consider anyone our foe, they don't consider anyone their friend. We were recommending them to the world. While they were quietly building army posts on our land. The Chinese army wants to gain control over Asia. And wants to ruin the world's peace. They are pawns who are moving ahead. They move forth with precision; to check-mate us. And it is our duty to foil their motives. We have orders not to open fire. And we will not. But we must never forget... that these Chinese don't have honourable intentions. And they are standing on our land. And are asking us to leave! Beware soldiers! Answer my signals. Send a message not to open fire till they start firing. We have orders that we must not fire till the Chinese don't. There is nothing to fear, brave soldiers. Don't fire till you receive orders. Understand? We're just 25 of us... and they aren't less than 300. Ask them to get 300 more. Their intentions don't look good. - Nor their luck. We won't begin firing and give them a chance to launch an attack. No firing! Each of us has to kill atleast 20 of them, sardar. Just twenty? Wait for it to begin, buddy! They are at a distance of 50 yards from us. No firing. No firing! This one l'm gonna get! - Whom? That bloody lizard! - They all look the same. What the hell is going on? Neither are they fighting nor, are they letting us fight. l could blow them up! - Don't you dare! We won't start the firing. Get it? 25 yards! - No firing. No firing! Chinese and lndians are brothers! Chinese and lndians are brothers! l never knew that! This is our land! Go away! Your men mustn't step here... we're brothers, after all. Well said! Chinese and lndians are brothers! We will not leave the post. We are there to protect our borders. We don't want a fight but we will not vacate the booth. Do what you deem fit. Send a message to the Head Quarters. Go ahead and write. The Chinese commander has told our commander... that our soldiers can come out of the post, but can't retract. But we are not vacating the booth. All food items will be sent by helicopter. Arrangements are made to give Ladhaki civilians rifle training. Aim... fire! What's up, Ram Swaroop? - l want to present this to you, sir. The first flower. lt's beautiful. Though it has not blossomed fully, it is a flower nonetheless. Your wife so lovingly sent the seeds to you. You must keep the first flower. lsn't it? Sir... - Thanks a lot anyway. Our government is holding talks with the Chinese government. They may move away in a few days. But we have to be cautious. So, most of you will accompany me to Post No 2. There we will be given more soldiers. So that if the Chinese act smart, we can help this post. ln my absence, you will be the commander of this post. lf there is any problem, handle it carefully. Rest assured, sir. Each of our soldier is equal to 20 of them. l know that. l may return in a few days. Then we'll celebrate Diwali together. - Yes, Sir. We're here, right now. And we've come from here. This is the Chinese post where they are holed up. Captain Bahadur Singh is here right now. You have to go and inform him... to come in from behind the Chinese and to set up his position. So that our men who are surrounded can get some relief. You must be there and at the first given opportunity... we'll send more soldiers. - Yes, Sir. Any more questions? - No, Sir. Go on. Good luck. The place from where we heard those brotherly slogans... are now shelling us, sir! l can't see the enemy! Nain Singh, l regret for not being with you. l consider myself unfortunate! - Don't worry, Sir. Every soldier is fighting fit. Bravo, Nain Singh! Keep it up! l'll talk to you later. Get me head quarters immediately. The enemy is bombing many posts simultaneously. lt is impossible to rush help from one post to another. Resist the enemy as far as possible. And if you have to leave your booth, move back and set up another post. What's the position now? Smoke and dust has impaired visibility, sir. Hold on, sir... l can see something! The Chinese troops are approaching! This is an attack, sir! They're approaching us from this side, too. They are approaching us from all sides. They are more than a thousand! - A thousand? Nain Singh! Quit that post immediately. lmpossible, sir! We had promised you,... that our each of our soldiers will kill atleast 20. l assure you, every soldier will fulfill his promise. Nain Singh, you will leave that post. Sir, we may not meet for Diwali. Wish everyone a happy Diwali on our behalf. Take this to Captain Bahadur Singh immediately. Hurry up! There, they are coming over the mountains. Each one has to kill atleast 20. - You bet! There's a message for you. - What's wrong with you? l was attacked on the way. - What? The attack has commenced. We are immediately summoned at the post. Hurry up! They are too many. - They are coming to you for a shave. Let them come, l won't spare them! More are coming to die. Leave the post. They are coming from all sides. Leave the booth. There is one remaining. - Forget it. Come! Didn't l tell you that we will kill your people at random? lt's you who've been killed indiscrimately. The entire battle field is strewn with dead bodies of your soldiers. Sonam, wait here for me. This is the only way and time to escape. And you follow me one after the other. Carefully! The enemies modus operandi is to first do extensive bombing. Then it surrounds the posts and then attacks. They have started here too. lt's the turn of Post No. 3 now. We won't fight here. We will surrender this position. We will meet them here ... and then we'll see. Hasn't Bahadur come? - No, Sir. Bahadur hasn't come yet? - No, Sir. l am worried about him. You had your fill, now let me. Chinese and lndians are brothers! Congratulations on your victory! But l won't permit you to stay there. But Sir, each of our solders equals 20 of them. And we've proved it. lf we are allowed to counter attack, l'm sure we can retrieve post no 1. But l've information that the enemy is surrounding you from all sides. Sir, l am waiting for captain Bahadur singh. l had sent him a message to meet me here. Bahadur hasn't come yet? Hasn't he sent a message too? There is some information. l've received news that the enemy is closing in on you. They are around 2000 in number. Leave that place at the earliest. Sir, Bahadur has only a handful of soldiers. How can l leave him? We can not risk so many lives for one man. Tiger, you will leave immediately or you will be ruined. There is only one escape route now,... from behind the mountains. Hurry up. That is an order. There is a canal behind the mountains. What shall l do? How can l leave Bahadur Singh behind? l can take on the enemy. Why l am l being asked to leave this place? ls everything all right? - l'm fine, but not he. Today l'll give you a chance to win the bet. Tell me if the bullet hit me or no not? You will lose. - Then you win. Okay, you aren't hurt. So, give me Rs.20. How long will you walk? We are walking like dead bodies. We have lost our way. No one's talking! No one is answering anything; answer me! There is a death like stillness... with only a few comrades. - You need rest, Vir Singh. All of us have been starving for the last 3 days, and are tired. You are not the only one. Did l feed you all so that you get fed up within 2 days? l am not complaining about starving. l want to know why are we retreating like cowards? Why can't we die on the battlefield? ls this death better or that one? No one has any answers. Calm down, Vir Singh. You are an lndian soldier. l am a lndian soldier and a Rajput too. My father too was in the military. How will l face him when l return? What will l tell him when he asks me,... why did l return alive from the war? And what will Hukum Singh answer his brave father? Will he say that he's a coward?! - l don't want to hear that word! Who says you are a coward? Before asking me, ask yourself. lf you don't want to look within, l'll do it for you. Did you fight like a coward? - No. Didn't every of our soldier kill 50 of the enemy before he succumbed? lsn't it true that our hands were numb with firing... yet we didn't stop, but the bullets were over? That the enemy soldiers were multiplying in number? Yes. The enemy used 300-500 troops to kill 30 of our men. lt means the enemy's strong point was its strength. So, shouldn't we try to weaken this strength? Yes. So, our duty lies in our every soldier killing 20 of them,... and also in protecting his own life, so that we can kill more of them. So, it was not done to die at the hands of the enemy... due to lack of the bullets. You are experieced soldiers, well versed with the enemy's tactics. The nation needs you. lt is not cowardice to protect oneself whilst killing the enemy. None of you have run away from the battle. The war has not ended. ln fact, it has just begun. We have to increase our strength. And throw out the enemy from our land! We are here! Here! They neither see nor hear us. ls the wireless fixed yet? No. Their voice reaches us but our voice is not reaching them. May be there are looking out for us. Sir, there is some sound. There is no news from Major Ranjit Singh. Their wireless too is off. They were given orders to leave their booth. But, apparently they have not obeyed the command. The enemy had surrounded them completely. lt is not possible for any of our soldiers to have escaped alive. Looks like they've been killed. - What nonsense? Repair it and tell them we have obeyed the orders! Tell him that we could have vanquished the enemy. We are still fit and our soldiers are ready to fight unto death. They think we're dead! No one will even try to find us. News will be sent to their houses that... No! Only out of helplessness... must she have forgotten me Only due to helplessness, must she have forgotten me She must have swallowed the bitter pill painfully Only out of helplessness must she have forgotten me Her heart must have reminded her of past incidents Her heart must have relived better incidents And she must have wept unshed tears She must have burnt my letter behind closed doors Her heart must have been shattered and lay there on the floor Only out of helplessness, must she have forgotten me She must have tried to steer clear out of fear... She must have tried to stir out of fear... and seen her world crumble around her And when she must've moved my photograph from the table... When she must've removed my photograph from the table... she must've imagined me writhing in pain Out of sheer helplessness, must she have forgotten me Her desires must have been unfulfilled... And she must've smiled through her tears At the mention of my name she must've shed tears... At the mention of my name, she must've shed tears... and wept unconsolably on her friend's shoulders Out of sheer helplessness, must she have forgotten me When someone must've compelled to brush her hair,... her face must have mirrored her anguish She must be tortured by pain The colour must have drained out of her face Only out of helplessness must she have forgotten me And must've quietly swallowed the bitter pill Only out of helplessness,... Go away... Go on! - No. Go away, l say! Neither did she stop me nor mollify me Neither did she hold me nor cajole me Neither did she call out to me nor call me back l moved ahead slowly So much so that l got separated from her And finally got separated from her Sir, we're tired; we can't move any further. l know; let's rest for a while. This road will surely lead to a hamlet. This is the last journey. - The soldiers have lost heart. How is that possible? - They won't go any further. How long can we go on like this? Let's not talk now. Listen... this is the last lap. l hope it's not the end. There is a last segment everyday. lt is better to kill one self. Are you soldiers or corpses? lt would've been better had we been corpses. True. Atleast l wouldn't have to hear this answer. l am ashamed for being your officer. What will you do if the enemy challenges you? Will you accord him a welcome? Won't you fight him? - We will fight. Yes, we will fight. - Till our last breath. You are ready to fight the enemy,... but you don't want to live... for your family, friends and the regiment. For them we are already dead. Diwali is round the corner. We've lost track of dates, but it must be around. Just think, when they will know that you are alive... they will be elated and will give you a joyous welcome. l am elder to all of you. And now, l am like an elder brother to you, not your officer. Like yours, my feet too are sore. But l will walk ahead. And l will say,... that will-power is what keeps us moving. Shame on you, guys! Let's go. What is it? - Some injured soldiers have arrived! We must arrange help for them. - Hurry up! l am going to find out. Perhaps Captain Bahadur Singh is one of them. Don't get up. What are you doing here? - We have a house here. Don't you remember? l mentioned it. But what are you doing here? We heard some soldiers have returned from the battle, and... So we thought maybe our Captain Bahadur Singh too is there. He was with you? What is the matter? Please tell me. This man is coming from there. Tell her. There were only 5 men with the Captain. The enemy had surrounded them and seized their position. There was no possibility of their escape. Bahadur is dead! Bahadur is invincible. He is lying! Don't ever say that. The Major too is lying. Why did he speak all this? That Major is lying. - Address him respectfully. Major sahib is lying! Bahadur will be all right. - Yes, he will be all right. Go on home. That Major is lying. l will take you to my city. l'll buy you jewellery and clothes. Will you wear it? - Yes. And l'll take you to my mother. She's very nice. Would you like to meet her? - Yes. His handsome face haunts me lt sets off a passion in my heart What feeling is this that touches my being...? Could it be him...? l hear footsteps and l wonder... if it could be him How shall l break this news to the Brigadier? Post No. 3 at Kopran is vacant. Go and occupy it. l'll send more troops as soon as possible. There is no wireless there, so be careful. There is news, sir. - What is it? About Captain Bahadur Singh. Speak up. - He died in the war. l heard it. Today is Diwali? - Yes, Sir. Great gift! Sir, you wanted to address the soldiers on Diwali day. Shall l send the message? - l will surely address them. You may go. The Festival of Lights is here again... smeared in blood Our world is plunged in darkness; how can we light lamps? The Festival of Lights is here again... Children yearn for sparklers... and the walls for lamps When a mother is bereft of her sons,... how will she decorate her house? Let the light seek those paths... where lies happiness He was the one who lit up my nights He was the one who could lighten my heart All he has left behind is dark nights He has taken away the light with him The Festival of Lights is here again How many tears will we shed? How long will we shed tears? Tears teach me many a lesson There is mourning everywhere The Festival of Lights is here again lt comes smeared with blood Our world is plunged in darkness... how can we light lamps? The Festival of Lights is here again Happy Diwali to you soldiers, who fought valiantly. May you have the strength to bear your sorrows, perils and bruises! People in your country have sympathies for you... and have not lit lamps to celebrate the festival. This is an unprecedented Diwali. This is a black Diwali. And commands not to pray the Goddess of prosperity... but the Goddess of Valour. Once again Diwali will come and lamps will be lit. But only on the condition, that you sacrifice your blood. The blood of martyrs always brings results. A friend has stabbed us in the back. When he visited our country as a guest,... we gave him a warm welcome. And accorded him respect in every meeting. Every leader and artiste celebrated his visit. We were happy to see him pay homage to the angel of peace. We even asked him to award prizes to our soldiers. But today he sends his forces to shed the blood of those very soldiers. A friend did this! And for a moment we were devastated. But now we are once again in control. lf this friend has challenged us like a foe.... then we accept his challenge. Now we will never let our enemy rest in peace. This is our country! The country of Buddha, Ashoka, Gandhi and Nehru. We patronise peace, but not cowardice. And if in the name of friendship, the enemy stabs us in the back... we will gave him the treatment he deserves. Bahadur is so lucky to die a martyr. And had he survived, he would have had a nice girl like you. You must be missing your wife? - No. Why? - Because l never married. Or is it that you never wanted to marry? lt could not happen. - Reason? We are meeting after long. - You too didn't remember me. Last week, l had visited your house but you had gone out. l spoke to your mother. - Mother is very fond of you. And you? - You've never asked this before. lt did cross my mind but couldn't speak up. l've brought something for you. - What is it? Tell me. - First shut your eyes. Show me your hand. Not this, the other one. You are wearing a beautiful ring. Who gave it to you? Major Pratap Singh. - Congratulations and all the best! When did you meet Pratap? - A month ago. What did you want to give me? - Nothing! Forget it. l never realised you love me so much. This is life! l've brought something else also for you. lt is so beautiful! Shall l wear them? When are you meeting Pratap? - He's expected here today. l'll just come. They look good on you. Where did you get such beautiful earrings from? Tell me or l'll die of jealousy. - Then get jealous! l wonder why l've still retained this ring. lt is the symbol of my misfortune. - Show me. Keep it. - What will l do with it? And what will l do with it? - lt is very beautiful. Keep it. Please accept it. You have gone through a heart break, l too am unhappy. l think by being together we can lessen our grief. Major, l can't hurt you, so l don't want to refuse you. But l request you not to compel me to accept this ring. l can't forget him. This is a very inauspicious ring which has been rejected twice. He is our own soldier. - And as fatigued. What is your name? - Sir, you?! l am talking about Captain Bahadur Singh. He is alive! Sir, we've received the message that Captain Bahadur Singh is alive. l am Tiger speaking. Heartiest congratulations! - Thank you! l'm sorry to give you the bad news earlier. Bahadur has safely reached Kopran booth no 3. ls he injured? - No, but he needs rest. We have received the news just now. Didn't l say Bahadur is invincible? Let him rest there. Sir, there is news. You can go. Didn't l tell you the Major was lying? l've received news that your position is at a risk. ln a few hours, 200 enemy soldiers will attack you. And your soldiers are all injured. So, it is necessary to stall the enemy till the morning. So that you and your soldiers can be flown by a helicopter. Because the enemy is approaching from the route where your post lies. So, the soldiers on that booth must stall the enemy. Sir, only Captain Bahadur singh is there with one more soldier. lnform Bahadur. - Sir, how can 2 men hold 200 ? lf they don't go, you and your injured soldiers will perish. The enemy can be stopped at the mountain opposite to your booth. Sir, Bahadur has just escaped the clutches of death. l know. - And you are again sending him here? You are right. - Sir, Bahadur is my friend... and your son. We are ready to fight unto death. Permit me to call him here. We'll combat the enemy here. Who are you? - Captain Bahadur Singh's friends. Do me a favour. Take this letter to Bahadur singh. Where? - Behind that mountain. Okay. - lmmediately! You take the letter. - Do l have to go alone? Now you can prove you are brave. And you? - l'll wait, to distract the enemy. Crawl and go. Aren't you ashamed to fire at a woman? You are a Ladakhi and we are Chinese. Chinese and lndians are brothers. You work and go to your village and praise us. We will reward you. And you must spy for us. And we will reward you another 500 Rupees. Will you do it? Won't you speak? You won't? You won't, eh? Sonam, why have you come here? Today we've received that order which is every soldier's dream. We have to leave on a mission. So, you won't speak? Sonam, now you go home. - l won't go. Why? - You must obey your elders. l won't go. - You will too! No! - You won't go? No! While giving me this medal, you had said, that you'll take it away... if l act cowardly. And now you are asking me to behave like a coward. l too know to use a rifle. You are brave, not a coward. But you have to take care of your sister. She is the one who sent me here. She's no coward either. She was coming with me but we were intercepted by the Chinese. Why did you leave her alone? - What else could l do? Where is she? - Behind the mountains. Why did you leave her alone? Go and fetch some more bullets. What happened? - Nothing. l'm okay. Carry on. There are no bullets here. What shall l do now? Did he send me here on a pretext? We have laid down our lives, friends... We now entrust the nation to you We have sacrificed our lives, friends We now entrust the nation to you Our bodies were numbed... yet we did not falter We did feel sorrow to behead ourselves.... yet we did not let down our nation We fulfilled our mission Now, we entrust the nation to you There are enough reasons to live, ... but one doesn't always get a chance to lay down his life To dishonour love and beauty... the youth that lies in a pool of blood Today my nation is bedecked like a bride Now, we entrust the nation to you May the path of sacrifice never be barren' You must always follow that path The occasion of victory is enthralling Life is embracing death Be ready to lay your lives Now we entrust the nation to you Fight valiantly for your nation Let no demon rule our land Break the hands that are raised on you Let them not bring us dishonour You are the heroes We now entrust the nation to you We have sacrificed our lives, friends We now entrust the nation to you
