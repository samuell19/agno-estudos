Dust welcomes you to a special viewing experience. We thank you for joining us to explore the depths of the unknown in a dark, isolated, and quiet place... the ocean. It goes largely unexplored, and yet holds so much. A different life exists beneath its undulating surface. You may have sensed its edges, ventured only to a shallow depth, but science is our most curious passenger, and it seeks more. This is "Sea Fever." Oh, thank you! Aw, nice to meet you! Good to see you. Did you get some cake? Not joining in? I don't do joining in. Look, this parasite isn't hadal. It's in totally the wrong place. No, you are in totally the wrong place! What time are you supposed to be on board? 3:00? But this is important, Professor. And your doctorate isn't? You wouldn't fail me for not going? I would have no choice. Off you go. But I-I know my strengths, I'm a good observer, I'm good at seeing patterns. You are an excellent scientist. That's not in question. I need my own space, I can't do other people. This environment is much more in the form of... Siobhan! There's some birthday cake over here. Do you have any friends in this department? - But I... - Get going! Get your hands dirty, make a few friends. As I was starting to think you weren't coming! Sorry. Skipper would have my guts for garters. That's a horrible thought! There she is! Niamh Cinn-Oir! She's here! .Okay... Trick is, don't think, just jump. Go on, give her a hand. Siobhan, this is my auntie Ciara. You're the scientist, I hear. She's a charmer! Have I ever let you down? Apart from the times I let you down, I mean. We'll need a miracle. Want to meet our student? Ah, here she is at last. I am Gerard the skipper, this is Freya, the real boss. She's a Viking. Keeps us all afloat. Siobhan, is it? Gerard? Don't forget to talk to Omid. Johnny. You're getting worried about this. It's our water, it's important. So when's the heir to the throne arriving? - Three weeks. - Oh, yeah? Then I'm definitely gonna start looking for something else. So your job is up for grabs, huh? Take it easy now, I said I'm gonna start looking. Yeah, you're always saying that. Alright, lads? - Good to go? - Yeah. Just, uh, checked over his work, made some corrections. Now listen, - we owe you money. - Aw, great. You'll get your last share on top of this share. - What? - Soon as we get back, you have my word. Sound okay? Eh... Skip, you know, I have the baby coming. I know, I know. You'll get your shares. Are we good to go? - Yeah. - Alright! I'll make it up to ya! We need a big fucking haul this time. So, what's your work? Well, um... I identify and extrapolate patterns from variations in deep sea faunal behavior. Then I generate algorithms and computer simulations to predict ecological outcomes. I meant what is your work while you're on board? I need to photograph your catch, look for anomalies. Won't be hard. We get all sorts. And, um, I need to do a short dive. Like under water? Do you dive? - Fishermen don't swim. - Why not? 'Cause it's better to go fast. Nobody wants to drown slow. Uh. Sudi! You haven't met Siobhan. Fucking hell, man! Well she's pleased to meet you too, mate. Does the skipper know about this? He does now! - A redhead. - We've already spent her fee. I know, but we can't afford any bad luck. So you think the color of my hair is bad luck? Oh, well there's two schools of thought on that. I can't change what I am. I know, I know, but um... Maybe just...? Not such a bad idea. Anchors away. Alright then. Pick a bunk! - Why only four bunks? - Oh, shift work. Three people sleep and three people work. - How long's a shift? - You get about 2 hours sleep. What? Sleep loss effects cognition. - Oh, talk to me! - You get emotional outbursts. I barely know who I am by the end. Even psychosis? Sea fever. Happens. Eejit, come on. You're not on shift. Protect us, oh, Lord, from all the perils of the deep. My Christ who filled the nets of his disciples deliver us safely back to harbor. Amen. Make your last calls, we'll be out of coverage in a few minutes. Fisheries are in. Look at that. Yes. Yes. Yes! Our water filtration system. You spend years at sea and always have fresh water. - It's magic. - Magic? - Where'd you go to school? - Same place as she did! Our doctoral student, Siobhan. How many filters? z Eh, three. Ascending gauges. - Ionizer? - There. - You designed this? - Yes. - Yeah, I did. - It's brilliant. Why don't you have a better job? Don't be fooled by her winning personality, - she can be quite blunt. - No, I... I just mean for such a talented engineer, it's a low status job. Yeah, well you know, I... I have been waiting for the right opportunity I guess. Hey, don't touch that! - Ooh! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Yeah, sure? - She needs a place to work. - Not in here, I'm sorry. - Too dangerous. - I'm not hurt. I'm afraid I might be. I don't mind you working there. It's not always quiet, but... Oh, it's great, thank you. Are you cold? Mother of Jesus, a redhead. Take that thing off ya. You're here now, we better get used to ya. Niamh Cinn-Oir to Coast Guard. Over. Freya, did you pick up my e-mail? Coordinates are for the exclusion zone. Over. Fuck! Bang on top of our fish! Okay. We'll steam through the exclusion zone. Over. No, not allowed. Whales and calves in the area. Over. Roger that. Over and out. Good luck out there. Coast Guard out. There goes our catch. We'll get the hassars. Oh, you don't want it? Okay. Um... Are ya hungry? No! No, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'll just, um... I'll, uh... Turn it off! You out here every night? Oh, come look, come! It's a bioluminescent phytoplankton. It's one of the stories of Niamh Cinn-Oir. She was so sad about losing her lover Oisin, she gave herself to the sea. Drowned herself? No. No. She is immortal. That's her hair, lights up the sea. Thanks. Wow! Out here? Whales on starboard, lads. What? What? - Oh, yeah, look! - Yeah, I can see! There's two of them. - Can you see it? - Yeah, yeah, I see it! And I think there's a calf. Look there's another one, just behind. Can you not see them? No, I can, it's, um... It's just that whales aren't usually around fishing lanes. They don't like the noise. Something's wrong. Don't start that. Whales are a good omen. Whales are a very good omen. Another shoal dead ahead, less than a mile. It's a big one. Freya? What? That shoal's moving pretty fast. - You alright? - Oh, Jesus Christ! Jesus, what did we hit?! Omid, what's the damage down there? Omid? Omid? Yeah, uh, can you send down the student? Siobhan? Hey, something's changing the texture of the wood. We letting in? No, no, we're okay. Go get the small gauge timber plugs. Now. Come on, fast, now! Tell me you know what that is? It's like we're caught on something! Niamh Cinn-Oir to Coast Guard, come in. Niamh Cinn-Oir to Coast Guard, come in? You took us into the exclusion zone. What is that? Chemical spill, maybe? - What's happening? - I don't know! - Are we sinking? - I don't know! - What? - Siobhan, Jesus Christ! - Are we sinking? - We are not sinking. You're a fucking eejit, do you know that? Christ knows what we're tangled up in. It could be anything! Good Jesus... Is this what's stopping us moving? Yeah, something's getting through the hole. Christ! What is that? Could be a species of barnacle. Do you have your scuba gear on board? I do. And you have to do a dive anyway. - Yes. - So you could do your dive and take off the barnacles for us. But that could be anything! It's what you're here for, anomalies, no? Here, listen. I've got you, yeah? It's a gutting knife. Just do your best. I'm never going back down there again! - What? - What happened? Describe what they looked like. - What? - It's... It's... It's one animal. It's one huge animal. Wait, what, as well as the barnacles? No, i-i-it's not barnacles, it's, um... It's connective tissue. - Connected to what? - Like tendrils, like, like a lot of tendrils. Water's cloudy, she doesn't know what she saw. Freya... A squid! Bet you it's some kind of squid. It's more like some kind of cnidarian, but, um... It could be a squid. But if it's a squid, it's bigger, it's bigger than anything on record... - It's... It's huge! - Giant squid! - You want the winch? - Oh, yeah! - All hands on deck, come on! - No...! Please! - We need to call for help. - We'll be fine. Squid can't hold their own bodyweight in shallow water. We lift it even a bit, it'll have to loosen its grip on the boat. That's how we get free. Johnny, winch her up. Keep it going. Gerard. Let go of the winch. Oh, fuck... Oh, fuck! Right, someone hit the brake! - Get the fucking brake! - Ow! Fuck! Ow! Sorry, sorry... Sorry. Take it easy. Easy, easy now! - There's another boat! - What? That way! Bastards. You're unbelievable. We'd have to split the profits. They might have a better winch. And a radio. Gerard can't row over there on his own. I'm not getting in beside that thing. No way. It's a bad idea. Let's just wait for the Coast Guard. Come on! Big commercial boat over there, they'll be able to help us. I'll go. - I'll go as well. - No. Ger... Three of us. Hello? Anyone aboard? Fine mesh trawling. Desperation makes you do things. Hello? Hello? They smashed the radio. Why would they do that? I don't understand. Shh, listen. I can't hear anything. That's what I mean. We should just go. Hello? Johnny, go on. Come on, Siobhan. Hello? Hello? Jesus Christ...! Fucking hell. Must have gone mad. Oh my God...! Oh...! Fuck... - Sea fever. - What? No sleep. One fella loses it. Spreads like wildfire. That might explain the suicide, but the eyes? Might've been the birds. Listen, say nothing about this. - Nothing at all? - Nothing at all! How will we get home now? Omid? Hey, how'd it go? They have a winch? Ah, they've their own problems. No help at all. We wanna show you guys something. That thing let us go, we're free! Didn't I tell you we'd be fine? Ha! Animals don't trap something and just let it go. Maybe it got injured when we tried winching it up? Could have secreted something defensive, I suppose. - Sounds plausible. - Or venom. And we're immune. Or a digestive substance. And the boat's inedible. Large mass heading this way, lads. Or it's coming back for us. Freya, we've no catch. And if that thing grabs onto us? We'll net it before it gets near us. We know now. God, it's a risk. Have I ever let you down? Huh? Listen, if you want, we can... we can steam home right now. But if we do that, we'll lose the boat. We'll lose the boat. - Shoot the net. - Yeah! Yes! We're on a roll! Woo! So, what'll you do with your shares? - Parts for the new bike. - Ah, Omid's old rust bucket? Hey, come on, it's a good bike. Hey! It's not a bike. It's a love machine. What's her name? Alice...? - Alison O'Reilly. - O'Reilly! Alison O'Reilly. We're hitting the highway. Just need a new sump. Sump. Every girl's dream. Oh God... Fuck. You okay? No, actually, I'm bloody knackered. Is it always like this? No. Sometimes it's scary. Things happen at sea. Yeah, but things like that other boat? Coast Guard'll deal with it. And listen, I've seen worse. You've seen worse?! Look. Can I give you some advice? Listen, we're here. We're safe so just... Let it go. For a minute. Rest. What would I do instead? Are you making a pass at me? No. 'Cause I've had people make passes at me before! - Yeah, I'm sure you have... - No, I mean... What I mean is... It would be okay if you were. Best catch we've had in months. Bad luck's streak's finally over. Yeah, it was about fuckin' time! - Hey, hey, guys. - Oh, bollocks! - Watch your head, man! - Hey, is there no free towel? You already took a shower. Look at you, man! Slime on me, that shit is everywhere. Johnny, your auntie said you're on kitchen duty tonight. Yep. Sounds about right. Hey, you guys okay? Hey, come on, sit down. - Omid. - Yeah? Are you ready for the responsibilities of fatherhood? You look hot. Thank you. I was going to say the same about you but you got there first, so. I mean you might have a fever. Nah, I just had a shower. Yeah, for fucking half an hour! You smell that guys? You smell something? Oh, it's the shit from... Excuse me, excuse me! Have you looked in the mirror lately? There's this black thing on your face! Everyone, everyone. Redhead or not, best student we've ever had, - am I right? - Hear hear! - Nerves of steel! - Yeah, she is. Yeah, as long as she's not trying to find the winch brake! Sure, you were worse. We had to teach you how to eat spaghetti. No, spaghetti is stupid and you know it, okay? You know...! Hey, who was it that nearly - destroyed the engine, huh? - No, I'm going...! Let his rope fall around the propeller. Rope around the prop. It was bad. - It jammed. Killed the engine. - Hey, at least I make a good ship's engineer one day, right? Anyway, here's to the best student we've ever had. Cheers to that. You okay? Come on, let's go for a swim. Wait, what did he say? He said he wants to go for a swim. - Well fucking stop him! - Jesus Christ. Where's he going? - Johnny, stop. - I'm fine! I'm fine! Leave me alone. I'm fine. We're going in, we're going... We're going for a dip. Look, 30 seconds, it's just a dip basically isn't it? - Don't! - Come on. - We're going swimming. - You're not going in. - No, no, no! - You're not going in. I'm grand! Take it easy now, come on. Lunatic. There's a motherfucking monster out there! What kind of eejit goes diving off a trawler to impress a girl? - What the fuck, Johnny? - What are you on? Nothing. If you brought drugs onto this boat...! I didn't and I wouldn't. - Did you give him something? - No, he's hot. I think his hand might be infected. - Let me see your hand. - I'm fine. I'm fine. I need to sleep is all. Johnny, would you like me to look at your eye? What? - I think I saw something. - Let me see. Come here now. Can't see anything. Bloody hell, you nearly had me going there. Jumping at shadows. Relax the head. You...! Get some sleep. Right, well, I'm just gonna... over here... Fuck! Jesus, Johnny! Take it easy! - Let me see, let me see! - What is it? You're okay, take it easy! I-I... I can't... I can't see. Johnny! No! Noooo! Oh, God! - Shhh! - Help! Let me up, please. What is it? Johnny, Johnny, shh! You're okay. Oh, my God! Oh, Johnny! Oh, Jesus! Move back. Don't touch anything! Move back! Move back! Come with me, right now. Come with me. I love you. Listen, um, they were parasites in his eyes. - What? How? - They went into the water. I'll go turn it off. Where's Sudi? Sudi! Turn off the shower! - Fuck off! - We're not fucking joking! Turn off the shower now! Sudi! Sudi?! Sudi, please! Listen to me! Open up the door! Oi! Bastards! Now Sudi! Turn off the shower! Turn off the water! Hey, listen to me. Open the door. Open the door right now! Sudi! Sudi, please, listen to me! Alright. You're alright. You're alright. It's okay. Come here. Okay... Shhh... Johnny... I have ya. You're okay. You're okay. Straight through the steel. Jesus Christ! Oh! Agh! Fuck! It's okay, it's the filter. Where does this flow to? Nothing can get in or out now. Except through the lid. We need to open it. Are you crazy? If I can identify them it'll be helpful. Put these on. Hey, please, careful. What are they? I don't know. But I think... Maybe they're larvae. We need to get those things out of the tank. So empty it! What are you waiting for? Fuck's sake! - How? We've no pump. - Exactly. - And we need fresh water. - We'll boil it. And what do we do for drinking water? Fish them out of the tank! They bit through the steel water filters. They'll probably be dead in the next few hours. Alright, alright. We're all grieving. What did you say? If I'm right... they're saltwater larvae in fresh water. They'll be dead in the next few hours. Right. She's... She's right. Did Johnny get bitten like this? No! No, he didn't. Let's just focus, huh? What did they say, on the other trawler, huh? Nothing. They're all dead. It was sea fever. They took their own lives. Alright? Now... We need to keep our heads clear, yeah? Omid, get Sudi to bed. And um... You and Siobhan will check the water - in two hours time. - Okay, good. We'll say a prayer for Johnny at dawn. Let's all get some rest now. You take first watch. - What? - She's fine, Ciara. Okay? Yeah? There you go. She doesn't even know my name, man. Alison O'Reilly. I haven't even spoken to her. What are you talking about? I was just waiting for the right time. The right time? And then you... You're alright. I just can't believe... It's time. - Are they dead? - I think we're good. Yeah? Not long til they eat through the tank. They're weaker. I think there's fewer of them. We'll just have to wait. He who puts himself in my hands, though he were dead, yet shall he live, and whosoever trusts in me, shall never die. Se do bheatha, a Mhuire, ata lan de ghrasta, Ta an Tiarna leat. Is beannaithe thu idir mna, Agus is beannaithe toradh do bhroinne; Iosa. Have you something to help you sleep? Listen, burn the engine if you have to. Just get us home fast. What are you doing? You're still bleeding. Everything is fuzzy. Is this what happened to Johnny? No, he had a fever. You've just lost a lot of blood, so it's affecting your eyes. You mean I'm going blind? - Yes, might be temporary. - Might be?! Listen, I'm sorry, I can't help you right now. I need to focus. Fucking redhead. None of this would have happened without you! You're confusing coincidence and cause. My hair and this happening is coincidence, but... It was the slime! The thing that attached itself to the boat. It mistook our boat for an animal. Probably a whale. And when it latched onto us, i-it produced a progenerative substance. And Johnny had an open wound. So, uh, the slime got into Johnny's blood and there were eggs in the slime? Not were... are. They're still alive. Sudi's got open wounds, we've all got cuts. We're all vulnerable to get infected just like Johnny. If we're not already. Any good news? We need to kill those eggs right now. - Fucking how?! - I don't know! I study behavior patterns in a lab. You kill things. Give it here. Here. This won't work. So what do we do? Can you make a UV light? Why? Other hadopelagic species, their spawn, you can kill it with intense UV light. You have a smart phone? I learnt this in a bar at Tishreen University. Where's that? Syria. You met your wife there? - How'd you guess? - I don't guess. I study behavior patterns. You were touching your wedding ring. - It's tiny. - Just do the test. We can figure out how to make it bigger later. It's too tiny anyway. How long til we're home? I'd say about 30 hours. We'll all be infected by then. Omid. I have another stupid idea. Are you mad? Disinfectant doesn't kill the eggs, UV light doesn't either. So you want to electrocute the Niamh? Yes. We use the ARC welder. Sea water as a conductor and run a current around the boat. Come on, as long as we're all wearing rubber boots there's no risk to us. And you'll take responsibility? Hold on! What about the motors? The engine? I'll try and insulate them. Oh, you'll try! And what about the risk of fire? Are you insane? No! Fucking no! You can't risk my boat! It's a risk either way. You risk the boat or you risk our bodies. Fuck's sake! This is insane! Pretty sure Omid'll sort it out. Okay. Do it. Omid? Are we on fire? No, it's just... just surface electrics. Did it work? - I think so. - Thank you. We can go ashore once we know we're clear. We are clear. It took Johnny at most 36 hours from exposure. So obviously we have to wait 36 hours - from when we destroyed the eggs. - We're making port tonight. Freya, if any of us is infected, then... Then we'll be better off in hospital. Freya, wait! You know Christmas Island? - What? - It has the world's biggest population of red crabs, it used to. - So? - So, a few yellow ants arrived and they blinded the red crabs. Just a few ants. Now there aren't anymore red crabs. Do you see what I mean? Yeah. The crabs should have gone to hospital. This is what I do. - Faunal behavior in spe... - Yes, in a lab. But this is the real world, with real people! And in the real world, if we go ashore and one of us is a carrier, then those things will spread, really fast. Sudi is my responsibility. And he's bleeding to death in there. We can't just think about Sudi. I am not losing one more crew member. Omid, I need your help. Yeah, what? When we get to port, help me keep everyone on the boat. That'll never happen. First sniff of land, we'll all be off and gone. Just until we know we're not infected! Have you seen Sudi? Have you seen him? He needs help now. Where do you live? Galway. 200,000 people in Galway, right? - Yeah, it's about that. - Yeah. We can't say we're so important that it's worth risking the lives of 200,000 people. Yeah, maybe. But who are you to say that this poor kid has to die so someone else can avoid the risk? Are my eyes open or closed? Open. Shh, you'll be alright. Shhhh. You'll be alright. Sudi? God is our hope and strength. God is our hope. We will not fear, though we be in the midst of the sea, God is with us, and we will not be removed. Amen. We need to quarantine ourselves now. Maybe you've no life, but we have responsibilities. Listen. Omid's wife is pregnant. We need to get them home. If they want, they can get themselves to hospital. - Now seriously, fuck off! - But you don't understand! Did you not hear me?! Huh?! You okay? How's Ger? Not infected if that's what you mean. Aw, no. Oh, no, no, no! Fucking... Fuck... Come here. Why has the engine stopped? Tell them. I disabled the boat. What? I disabled the boat. - Agh! - Hey! Hey, hey, hey! What the fuck's your problem?! - We've all got cuts. - But we killed the eggs! We could have got infected before that! - So we get help! - There is no help! So... You want us to sit out here and die? I want us to stay on the boat until we're sure that none of us is infected. - Your bloody 36 hours. - It's not mine. It's your family's. It's your husband's, it's your baby's. Blame me if you want. We have to take action. We have to take responsibility. Listen, I know I caused this. Don't. I let you do it. We could have gone back home when that thing let us go, but I kept us here. It's not all on you. God knows who's next. You saw something in Johnny's eye before he died, didn't you? Yes. I want you to test all of us. I don't see anything. - Want me to do you? - Mm-hmm. - I don't see anything. - Look again. It's really faint. No, I don't see anything. Do me. Not you. Omid. Come on. Just let her do it. I think you're fine. Okay. My turn. I don't see anything. - Okay. - She scuppered us for nothing. You haven't done me. I don't need to do you. What? Give me that thing. Fuck! - Oh, God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - It's alright, it's okay. It's okay, it's alright. - It's alright. - No. No. Listen. - That place. - Gerard, no. We weren't meant to be there. - What? - What do you mean? I changed course and I didn't tell anyone. I took us into an exclusion zone. That's why we saw the whales. Come on. - You changed course? - I changed course. So do the Coast Guards know where we are? Did you know about this? Hmm? - Ger, come on. - Ciara... - I think you should go. - Come on. - You fucking bastard! - Stop it! - Johnny's dead! - We're family! Oh, yeah? I had my own family. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Little blondie head on her. Little Niamh. I thought nothing this bad could ever happen to us again. I don't mind going. 'Cause I'll see her again. Wait! Wait! Wait! O, a chuisle... Freya. Freya! Are you taking a rowboat? Double your chances of being found. Just stop, please! Listen! You're three fucking days from shore in that thing! - Call it quarantine. - Come on, Freya, please? There's white spirit and stuff in the forepeak. Make a flare. There's also the inflatable boat. Hey, please. What about the Niamh Cinn-Oir, huh? Do what you want with it. It's just a boat. That's inside the boat. Freshwater? They're alive in freshwater! - That sounded like one animal. - Yeah. So they ate each other like tadpoles. One animal wins. How... How do we get the one animal out? We stun it. We run electricity through the tank. No, that doesn't... Only works in salt water. Okay. Okay, okay. It's a parasitic life cycle. It's hadopelagic. But pressure is not a problem. Yeah? It's um... It's hadopelagic. Yeah, you said that. So it likes the deep cold. We heat the tank. - What, will that kill it? - No. - But it will slow it down. - Enough for us to kill it? Enough for us to safely return it to the wild. Oh, wait, what like, are you insane? - It's a rare animal. - Yeah, so are we. - We're intelligent. - T-That's debatable. This is our duty! It's in the wrong place. It only wants to survive. Just like us. So you risk dying to protect something that wants to kill you? How do we heat the tank? Let's find out. Now? Omid! Agh! Right through the hull. Get the food. - We're sinking? - We're sinking. White spirit. - We can make a beacon. - With what? Okay, you ready? No. Let's go. Omid! Hurry! I-I can't swim! Omid! Grab my hand! Grab my hand! Pull! No! No! Oh! Omid! Oh, carry on...! Thank you! Thank you... Siobhan. Siobhan. Look! Look! I'm infected. No. Let me see. Okay. We'll just... Okay, we'll, listen... We'll just... We'll just tourniquet this area, okay? Stop the poison from spreading. Okay. Yeah? Hey. You might be immune. Okay? We're going home. - Okay. - Omid... Omid...
