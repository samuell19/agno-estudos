Now, have you got everything, Aya? I think so, Mommy. Where do we go? Hello, are you looking for someone? Where's the fourth grade house? You walk straight down there, take the first to the left. -Thank you. -Welcome. It's best you take a shower before we make a start. I had a shower this morning. We always shower before tea. That's the daily routine here. For example, this is no good. Well, come along, come along. I don't want to, Mommy. You had better understand that won't do. It's a bad beginning. Come on. I need a towel, matron. Didn't you bring one along? No towels were mentioned on the list. INA: Then I'll see to it that you get a new list. The girls and boys shower together here. You've no need to be shy. You try and get accustomed to it now. [CHUCKLES] -[CHILDREN LAUGHING] -[GASPS] She's scared out of her wits. Look, I'm sure she's gonna cry. See how she's clinging to her mother, huh? ZEELA: I guess her father's promising to send her a present. HANA: Yeah. ZEELA: She's never gonna let them go! HANA: Wonder where her parents are going. ZEELA: I don't know. HANA: Do you think that she's nice? She's pretty small. [DOG BARKING] ZEELA: You take her to meet the other kids, Hana. I've gotta muck out the stables. HANA: Okay. Hi, there. I'll show you around. Come on. Well, come on. No need to be shy. This is Uri, our prized loafer. This is Tami, our big cry baby. Meet Shlomi. He's got the biggest dick in our class. And here's Hava. She's our little teacher's pet. It's better than being a liar like someone I'd mention. Shut up! Just you shut up because you found someone to show off to. HAVA: You're a bore. Get out of our room! Don't try telling me what to do. This is our room. Make yourself scarce. No, I won't. I can come in here when I like. HAVA: That's what you think! HANA: Let go of my hair! [GRUNTS] Let go of my hair! HAVA: Then got out of here! Will you two stop and let me read in peace? Hey, that's my book! No, it's not! I got it from the library today! I was reading it first! Don't you take it again! [SOBBING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] BOY: Hey, Roni! Get out of the way! RONI: Those two are in the sixth grade. The one in the white shirt is called Giora. He's Hana's boyfriend. Really? Yes. And the other one is Dodo. Your parents live far from here? Their place is down here. SHMIL: Ooh! How many slices did you bring today? -RONI: Same as usual. -But today, we've got an extra mouth. AYA: I don't eat bread. What do you mean? Bread is good for you. -Hello, Aya. -AYA: Ah. Do you remember me? I met you at your home, in Tel Aviv. -Oh, yes. -GILA: Hello, Aya. I'm Gila. Mother to Shlomi Roni and Rudi and now I'll be your mother while you're here, okay? How long are you gonna keep him up there? Only 10 minutes to go. Is it necessary? He must learn as a child not to be afraid. Builds character. Aya, meet our young speaker. Another adopted child. Go on, tell her what kind of parents we are. They're wonderful. A man who risks his own son's life in order to teach him a lesson. Hello. Sit down, Aya, sit down. Roni, don't touch that cake. Take your hands off. Your mother didn't stay up all night baking it just for you to come along and guzzle it all in one bite. Now, then. Here's a slice. Shmil, cut him a bigger slice. That wouldn't feed a mouse. Now, you stay out of this. Let me run things the way I think best. I know what a little pig he is. GILA: You're cutting it so thin, you've got nothing but crumbs there. Well, what's wrong with a few crumbs? -Here, have some crumbs here. -I don't want any, I'm not hungry. Well, of course you do. It is delicious! It'll make you grow big. Oh! [CHUCKLES] Where are my crumbs today? -Didn't I give you any? -No, but I'd prefer to cut my own, thanks. SHMIL: Go ahead. A little bit. A little bit. [CHUCKLES] Shmil, have you forgotten Shlomi? One minute yet. [CHILD CHEERING] GIRL: Hey! Give me that, that's mine! Don't run away with it! Oh, God, that's not fair! Give it back! It's not yours. They say you've come from Tel Aviv. I'm a stranger here too. Are your parents divorced as well? AYA: No, they've gone to Thailand to look after sick children. Where do you live in Tel Aviv? 3 Bnei Ephraim street. Come on, Aya. It's time to go to bed. Zvika, lift me up. Why? Doesn't Neni do it well enough? Just look at the queue! Okay, just once. [HAVA GIGGLING] Off with you. Roni? Roni, to your bed! Isn't it scary? -What? -What you did to Hava. Come on then try. Roni! Roni, I said to bed. Get to bed! URI: When you join the army, what're you gonna do? I'd like to be a cook. No, you're kidding. I'm telling you the truth, I want to be a cook. You don't call being a cook a real soldier. ZVIKA: Who said I have to be a real soldier? But don't you want to? I don't like killing, so... If you don't want to kill, you'll be killed by them. Maybe that isn't true. If I don't kill them, could be they wouldn't want to kill me. Aren't you undressing? Don't you think that is a possibility? -Well? -I'll get undressed later. You don't want me to help you fold your clothes? So, I'll say good night. Well, good night, Roni. RONI: Good night, Zvika. URI: Good night. Shouldn't you be undressing? Hello. I'm fine, how're you? Have you heard the news? I'm in love! TEACHER: Pay attention to your elocution. Oh, no, that's a secret. Okay. When we talk on the phone, there are two people talking. If I say to you, "Hello", what do you say to me? ALL: Hello. ALL: How are you? I'm fine, thank you. How are you? ALL: I'm fine, thank you. Then I say to you, "Have you heard the news?" And you say to me... [MOUTHING] ALL: No. What? Tell me. I'm in love! -[GIGGLING] -TEACHER: And of course you want to know "Oh, what's his..." ALL: Oh, what's his name? Oh, no. That's a secret. Okay, who wants to try it with me? Roni. Let's try. Ready? Hello. Hello, how are you? I'm fine, thank you. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. Have you heard the news? No. [MOUTHING] What? Tell me. I'm in love. -Oh. -Oh. [MOUTHING] What, what's his name? Oh, no, that's a secret. Good. Very good, Roni. Very good. Well, you know, when two people are in love, it very often leads to marriage. These two people were in love. And they got married. This is the picture of a marriage. We're going to learn a song about two people who are in love and want to get married. I'll sing first, okay? ♪ Daisy, Daisy ♪ Give me your answer do. ♪ I'm half crazy ♪ All for the love of you Shouldn't I wear my dress? I just wear what I want. Well, I am. Sure, you're just trying to impress Giora. What dances do you know? AYA: A few. What do you dance here? Oh, there's many different ones but the best one is called Boy Takes Girl. -How do you do it? -We start by making a circle. The boy in the middle has to dance. [SINGING IN HEBREW] [MUSIC STOPS] [ALL GROAN] MAN: Enough for today. That's it. [CHILDREN PLEADING] MAN: One last dance. That's it, okay? -BOY: Yay! -Form yourselves in pairs. -Will you dance with me? -Mmm-mmm. You don't want to dance with me ever. I don't like to dance. That's all. Oh, but you think it's fun with Giora. -So. -Well, then. Does anyone want to dance? Uh-huh. BOY: I want to dance with you. Come on. [CHILDREN SINGING IN HEBREW] HAVA: [EXCLAIMS] He tripped me! He tripped me! [CRYING] GIRL: Are you all right? Who tripped you off? [CHUCKLES] Excuse me. WOMAN: Hello. I'm working here today because Zvika's not well. You're the new girl here. What're you called? -Aya. -Aya. You know where the laundry is? Go over there. Giora from the sixth grade is there now. I think you know him. He's taking down the washing and you can help. Who is she anyway? The daughter of two doctors from Tel Aviv. They've both gone to Thailand to work with the refugees. [MACHINE HISSING] [MACHINE HISSING] [MACHINE HISSING] [MACHINE ENGINE HUMMING LOUDLY] -I've been sent to help you. -What? I've got to help you with the wash. Oh. [MACHINE THUDDING] Take the washing at the other end. Put it in the trolley. What? There! Unpeg the wash and put it in the trolley. [MACHINE HISSING] Giora! Giora! Here. I can't reach, it's so high. [BOTH CHUCKLING] -Hi, there! -Hi. Danny and Amalya are going steady. Why don't we have a race? GIORA: Right, we'll see who's first. [BOTH GIGGLING] AYA: Oh, no! GIORA: Never mind, it's nothing. We'll soon pick them up. But what will I say? Don't worry, I'll say it was my trolley. BOY 1: Hey, hey, hey. Hey, bud, pass the ball. Hey, pass the ball. It's mine! BOY 2: Give us the old one-two. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] GIRL: Hava. You seem pleased today, huh? I really think it's certain. GIRL 1: What is? GIRL 2: Go on, tell us what happened now. Come on, it's not fair. Is it necessary to be so secretive? Well, it was yesterday evening after tea. I was sitting there wondering if he really loved me and Danny was all I could think about. Then suddenly, I got a real shock. I heard a noise, I look around. He was standing there grinning! [BOTH CHUCKLE] Well, he said, "What are you doing here on your own?" And I answered, "It's not against the rules." And leaning against the rails, he said to me, "I suppose there's no rule against asking." And he stood, looking at me for ages till some children came along. So, he knelt down and pretended to fasten his sandal. -Well, what do you think? -He must love you, Amalya. Why should that be love? Well, first of all I... I think the reason he talked to her was because he loves her. Secondly, he stood and stared at her. Thirdly, why did he stay, pretending to fasten his sandal? Just what I was thinking. You're talking nonsense, both of you. Because you're in love with him. ADA: But I think he loves Hava too. How could he love her as well? Oh, because of different things. He's in love with Amalya. Might be in love with the two of them then. -SHEELA: Impossible, no. -She said he might. He's obviously in love with Amalya. Has anything happened to you, Aya? Oh, yes. If only I was sure it meant anything. Tell us then. I was going to lunch yesterday and I met the boys of the upper grade on their way from the gymnasium. As I was passing, Abe whispered to Giora, "That's your sweetheart there." And Giora replied, "Why then, are you jealous?" That shows plenty. I don't think that it does. ADA: And why not? Because if he really meant it, he wouldn't have said it. Yes, that's what I thought as well, that's why I said I wasn't sure. Well, I think it means a lot myself. [BELL RINGING] DRIVER: Okay, jump off. [TURKEYS GOBBLING] AYA: See ya! HANA: See you! [TURKEYS GOBBLING] HANA: Are you scared of turkeys? AYA: No. Why did your parents go away to Thailand? They went to take care of refugee children. And why didn't they take you with them? 'Cause I couldn't go to school there. Don't you miss seeing them? -No. -I don't believe that. I can't even stand mine going away on a vacation without feeling terribly lonely. It won't be long if I just keep thinking of something else. While I'm getting the grain, you could be filling the water troughs, okay? Hana! Hana! Hana, open the gate! Hana! Hana, you've locked the gate. [TURKEYS GOBBLING] Mommy. Hana! Hana! Hana, you've locked the gate! Who shut you in there? -[MEEKLY] Hana. -That's bad. I guess she didn't know I was still in there. Hmm. That snobby Hava doesn't have to show off. Yeah. She really thinks Danny's in love with her. -Maybe he is, who can tell? -That's crap. You never know. Why should he be in love with her? Why did you lock me in? I didn't. Why would I lock you in? Tell me who did it then. How would I know that? Besides, you said you weren't scared of turkeys. And they still don't scare me. It's you who scares me more. -Me? -You heard. -Are you scared of me then? -No. [AYA GIGGLING] AYA: Zvika, let's play planes. ZVIKA: Okay. ZVIKA: Will you write to me when I'm in the army? AYA: Yes, but I don't know the address. ZVIKA: I'll send it to you as soon as I know myself. [BOTH LAUGHING] AYA: Is it true what you said that time or was it a joke? ZVIKA: What? AYA: That you were going to be a cook. -No, it wasn't a joke. -They'll all laugh at you. I'd rather they laugh at me alive than laugh at me dead. But if you die, they won't laugh at you. Only because they'll be ashamed to. SCHMIL: Hey! Stop filling her head with nonsense. ZVIKA: It's not nonsense, it makes sense. GILA: Aya, there's a letter for you. -It's from your parents. -AYA: Oh! Give it to me. Go on. [ZVIKA TAUNTING] Sorry, I was only teasing. -Give me the stamp. -I promised it to Ada. If you give it to me, I promise to tell you something. -What is it? -Don't tell them. -Go on, tell us. -No, I can't. Why don't you stop doing what Yazi tells you to do always? I don't always do what Yazi tells me. Okay, I'll do it but only on one condition. -No. -You don't know what. I can guess that you want to play doctors with us. But who wants to play doctors with you anyway? -Then what? -I'll tell only if Zeela will let me show on her what I saw. Nothing doing. Come on, please do it otherwise he won't tell us. ZEELA: I don't want to. I'll let you show it on me. No, on Zeela. HANA: Come on, Zeela, won't you do what we ask just this once? -All right, if you let me finish this page first. -[SIGHS] You've got to promise there's no kissing. Ah, rats, then what's the use? -Then no. -You win. There's no kissing. You swear it? -RONI: Yes, I swear it. -On what? On the new baby that mommy's expecting. Ha, you don't even want him to be born though. RONI: Oh, yes I do. Since when? Well, when mommy promised me when he grows up he'll have the chore of polishing boots. Okay, I'll do it. Come stand over here. Yazi, you'll be the tree. There. You're here. How can I see what's going on? But I've already told you the story. Well, hurry up. It's getting late. RONI: Right. It was yesterday evening on the way down to my parents' place. I was coming over the lawn, near the pine grove. All of a sudden, I heard a girl giggling. As I crept a little closer, I could hear the sounds of a man's voice as well. I was peeping through the buses when the girl said, "Someone's coming!" The man whispered, "There's no one there. "It's only a rat or a squirrel, dear." And so I got closer. To my total surprise, there was Ina and Shimon. Which Shimon? Shimon, the father of Dina in the fifth grade. Ina was standing against the tree and Shimon was standing close to her. His hand caressed her cheek and looped down her neck. Then, he started unbuttoning her blouse. Very slowly, like this. Ina said, "Shimon, what are you doing?" Shimon went, "Shh!" And then when her blouse was open, he put both of his hands on her breasts and began kneading them. Just like my mother kneads the dough for breakfast. Not so hard, you're hurting me! Then he brought his head closer to hers like this and started to... Stop it! Enough! [BOTH GRUNTING] ZEELA: Let go of my hair. Stop this brawling, do you hear me? Roni, you should be ashamed. She started it! You're a dirty liar. That's enough, I will not allow such bad behavior. It's of no interest to me who started it. Now get into bed, all of you. [SNICKERING] Ada, when are you going to sleep? Very soon. Well, good night. [WHISPERS] Come on, tell us the rest! I'm not telling, unless I can show it on Zeela. Don't you come near or I'll scream out once again you monster, you're a liar! ZEELA: You donkey-head! [CHILDREN CLAMORING] TEACHER: All right, let's start. Quiet, please. Get into your places and we'll start rehearsal. Come along, you know where you stand. Now, everyone, listen to this note. [TEACHER PLAYS PIANO] Zeela, you're always late. [TEACHER HUMMING TUNE] [CHILDREN HUMMING TUNE] [SINGING HEBREW SONG] [CLAPS] We can't have all these late comers. [WHISPERING] Ask Ada where Giora is. [WHISPERING] Will you ask Ada where Giora is? [WHISPERING] Where is Giora? -Who's asking? -I'll tell you about it later. -Well, tell me. -[ANNOYED] Later! TEACHER: Stop all that whispering, quiet! I've lost the note again. [PLAYS PIANO] [TEACHER HUMMING] [CHILDREN HUMMING] [WHISPERING] He's sick. [WHISPERING] He's sick. [SINGING IN HEBREW] -Aya, aren't you in the choir? -Yes. Well, what's wrong? Nothing, I'm just late, that's all. Well, get a move on. What are you doing here, Aya? I'm working here today. Ada wanted me to stand in for her. But how come? She told me she was very happy working here. Why should she want to change? She didn't say, she asked me to substitute for her today and I said that I would. I won't put up with it. Now tell her we'll manage by ourselves. I want no more changes here. Then should I go? HANA: That's not fair, why should I have to clean the house by myself? Well, all right, you can stay for today, but just this one time. You can get a start cleaning the rooms. I'll clean the showers out. Giora's room doesn't need doing, I cleaned it myself this morning. [DOOR OPENS] Ah. Are you sick? -But didn't you know? -How would I know that? Didn't you see I wasn't around? What's wrong with you? I felt a bit sick, I got a temperature. Let me see. ADA: Aya, come to the stables. [HORSE NEIGHING] Do you love Giora? Why? Do you love Giora or not? Leave me alone. [HORSE NEIGHING] Tell the truth, do you love Giora? I'm not telling you, it's nothing to do with you. Tell the truth or I'm gonna kill you. Do you love Giora or not? -No. -You better not lie to me. Confess, do you or not? I'm telling the truth, so let go of me. I'm warning you, It better be the truth. Or else, next time I'll kill you. Promise you. [HORSE NEIGHING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] HANA: Aya, Aya, come here a minute. AYA: I'll stay out this time. GIRL: Okay. See, Giora did this crossword for me. I'm going to send it off today. That's nice. He's promised to do it every week for me. You could find one of the boys from the sixth grade to do it for you as well. I don't want to enter this term. If I wanted, I could always ask Giora. I don't suppose he'd do it for you. Why wouldn't he? Oh, a remark that he made. What remark? Nothing much. -What remark? -Something. Say it. Why must you always think everybody has to love you best of all, huh? AYA: Psst. [WHISPERS] Giora. [GRUNTS] Your hand's made of dough. Your hand's made of iron. [DOOR OPENS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] BOY: Shh! Some of the lights are on! GIRL: There are some kids who never think of turning the lights off. BOY: They forget, so what? GIRL: They shouldn't forget, it's not right. They just don't care what happens to kibbutz's money. Come on, leave it alone. Shake them hard, good, stretch your hands up, stretch each finger. Your thumbs stretch, good. -Who has the longest fingers? -[EVERYONE GASPING] Now, turn to face each other. GIRL: Neni! It's Zvika and Neni! [ALL CLAMORING] GIRL: They're leaving today, hurry up! Quick! Now, you be good. GIRL: Neni, what will you do in the army? -Take it easy, you guys. -I'll know when I get there. -Just see that you look after your kibbutz. -Okay. So long. -NENI: See you. -See you soon. Now, you kids be good. See you study well. AYA: Yes, I will. RONI: Send us lots of postcards. You promise? ZVIKA: Yes, I'll write to you and you write to me. Uri, wanna swap this stamp here? What for? -For the sports stamp, one of your triangles there. -Yes, okay. Not bad. From Poland, huh? Yes, it's from my aunt. My triangles! Someone's stolen my triangles! -Where were they? -Right there. I'll kill the thief when I find him! Could you have put them somewhere else? No, they were there! Uri! Uri! Where are you going? -I want my stamps back! I want my stamps back! -Back to your room! -They're mine! I'll catch the thief! -What is it? -Now, that's enough, I say. -BOY: What's happened? Someone's stolen my most valuable stamps! Whoever took them will pay with their blood! -Come to your room. -Thieves! Lousy, rotten thieves. Enough, calm down! I told you, you should've kept your stamps at our place, not here. They didn't need to steal them, they're mine, they're thieves. -Come to bed! -I want my stamps back from the thieves! -What's wrong with him? -[URI SHOUTING] Somebody stole his stamps. -Which ones? -His triangles. Those are really valuable. -BOY: Yeah. -Hana, bed time. Poor little Uri, someone's stolen his most precious tamps. Probably he forgot where he put them. No, no, they're stolen, that's for sure. There isn't anyone here who steals stamps like that. Well, someone has, they've done it. Hana, where are you going? HANA: Just a minute. -[SHMIL GRUNTING] -[AYA SQUEALING] There you are! Time for bed! -[PLAYFUL GROWLING] -[AYA SQUEALING] -Daddy, me as well, I wanna wrestle. -Oh, you as well, good. Who do you think took the stamps? RONI: Wasn't anyone from our class. I think I have an idea who did it. SHMIL: Well, it can wait till morning. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] URI: One, two three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! Tag! I think I know who it was who stole your stamps. Then tell me, who? I can't tell you who it is, but why don't you take a look in the drawers when no one's around. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, I'm coming! [CHILDREN SQUEALING] INA: You want sugar? Not today, huh? Ready for more? -You thief, you! -Uri, don't do that! She stole my stamps! I found my stamps in her drawer! -Aya, did you take his stamps? -No. But of course you did, I found them hidden in your drawer. RONI: I don't believe Aya took your stamps. Neither do I. It's impossible to say how come they're in her drawer. I don't know, that's very odd, but I'm quite sure Aya didn't do it. I didn't touch them, I don't collect stamps, why accuse me? Aya, come with me. I just can't believe she stole your stamps from you. -Neither can I. -HANA: But it's a fact! Why should she? She doesn't even collect stamps. Now, tell me exactly what happened. I didn't take any of his stamps. Did he annoy you? If he did, I wouldn't take his stamps. -Well, maybe he made you mad. -No. Then why did you take his stamps from him? I told you, I didn't touch his stamps. Listen now, Aya. It will be better if you told me. Uri will understand and we'll forget everything, okay? BOY: Hit it real hard! -Go on. -CHILDREN: [SHOUTING] Run! BOY: Come on! Come on, ready? Yeah. -GIRL: Yazi, catch it! -BOY: Yazi, catch it! GIRL: Come on, Yazi, catch it! Come on, Yazi, come on. Come on, come on. Yeah, come on, hit it! [ALL SHOUTING] GIRL: Yeah, come on! Come on! GIORA: Aya, come on, cheer up, it's better you say you're sorry. But it wasn't me. It's not so terrible. It could happen to anyone, I understand. BOY: [SHOUTING] Giora, run for it, run! Run, Giora, run! But it wasn't me who took them. CHILDREN: [SHOUTING] Come on! Faster! ALL: [CHEERING] Yay! Just you keep outta here, you thieving rat. GIRL: I guess it's true what they say about you. -What're you doing? -Nothing. -You can come to have supper with my parents. -No. There's no need to pay any attention to them. -Come on, Aya. -I know it was you who hid the stamps in my drawer. Bad luck. I'm gonna tell everyone it's you. And who's gonna believe that? It's quite obvious now who stole the chocolates that belonged to Ayna. I don't wanna stay here anymore. Where will you go? I've an Aunt in Tel Aviv, I can go and stay with her. What about school? Don't much care. Would you like a chocolate? Don't want to stay here anymore. She doesn't like chocolates. That's all she's getting. You know the candy won't help to solve the kid's problem. I think they should've taken her with 'em. -Where to? -Tell Aviv. [CHUCKLES] This isn't enough. Fare's more than this to Tel Aviv. I'm sorry, kid. How much is she short? Maybe, I can help. No, no. Where are your parents, from the kibbutz? [DOOR SLIDES OPEN] There now, that should be all right now. Now off to bed, and sleep well. What's this? What's this? -But who did this to you? -I don't know. Poor thing. It's Aya! I know it was you, you little bitch! What is it, Hana? I'll kill you for this, you bitch, you! ZEELA: Let her go, Hana! I'll kill her! [GRUNTING] You think you're clever, you stupid cow! Let her go, Hana! HANA: No, I won't! You little rotten rat, I'll kill you! [GRUNTING] ZEELA: Stop it! Stop! Get out of here! [SIGHS] [SNIFFLING] ZEELA: "Then I arrived at the carpenter shop in Jerusalem "and they made me into a large cross "and then one day I was carried up a hill and stuck into the ground. "They took nails and nailed a man onto me. "I don't really know anymore, 'cause I fainted." Good work, Zeela. What gave you the idea? When, I was on holiday in Jerusalem, my father told me the story, of how they crucified Jesus. You wanted the story of the transformation of a tree. I thought of the tree the cross was made of. Excellent composition. Let's hear from someone else now. Right, Yazi, let's see how your tree was transformed. "Once I was a tree, I'm a table now "and everyone eats off me." [CLASS GIGGLES] ESTER: All ready? We're gonna walk to the ponds. [CHILDREN CHEERING] BOY 1: It's great fun down at the ponds. BOY 2: Yeah, I hope they give us fishing rods. BOY 1: Yeah, last time we were there, they let us fish. [CHILDREN TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Ester? ESTER: Yes? Can I come to the ponds as well? Today? No. If you like, I'll stay with you. No. [MEN CLAMORING] -INA: You want cucumber? -BOY: I'd like a tomato. There. -GIRL 1: Cucumber for me! -Just a minute, one at a time. GIRL 2: I want a tomato, please. I haven't gotten to you yet. For you. I thought you'd sleep in today. When did you get to bed last night? We went to a party. I know about that, I'm interested in what happened after. ADA: Well, almost nothing. And almost nothing is what interests me most of all. Ada, what happened afterwards? I don't know what happened after party. We all went home to bed almost as soon as the party was over. INA: Is that so? Next time you steal walnuts just make sure that you hide the shells. I want to know whose garden was raided. Don't call on me to help you out. [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Show it. -I don't have it. -Where is it then? Come with me and I'll show you. [BARKING] [RONI PANTING] [PANTING] There it is. AYA: "Hello, Giora, "It's not worth your loving Aya. "Don't you see that she's a thief? "She's not nice at all. "You'll be much better off loving me. "Yours, with love, Hana." Take this and read it. GIRL: What is it? What's wrong, you gone crazy? But can't you read what it says? -What is it? What is it? -Let me see. What is it, Aya? Hana wrote a love letter to Giora. [CHAIR SCRAPING] And now she's frightened to face it. YAZI: Hey, why are you running away? Can you be sure she wrote it though? But it's easy to see she did. It's signed here, as well as that it's her hand writing. What's going on in here? Hana wrote a love letter to Giora. What love letter? Now go on, finish your breakfast. It's not at all nice what you're doing. Hana insisted it was Aya who wrote it. Why should Aya write a note like that? And the stamps, remember? We haven't forgotten them. Stamps, meaning what? But it was obviously her, she hid them in the drawer to get revenge on Aya, to get her own back. Why should she want revenge? Come on, you know nothing. Over Giora, of course. It isn't Aya's writing, we know it's Hana's. How can you be sure of that? -Perhaps, you're wrong. -We know we're not wrong. Hana, come on. Such a dirty liar! Until you admit that you wrote the letter, we won't let you go. [CHILDREN SCREAMING] [ALL LAUGHING] Stop that! If you don't confess, you'll stay there till morning. That doesn't frighten me in the least. That's enough, let her go. No, no! Don't let her go! Let her go, you guys are mean. -It's nasty. -BOY: No, no, no! [CHILDREN CLAMORING] No! All right, I admit, I'm broken. And I confess I wrote it, and I'm pleased I did it. For you're just a rotten outside kid and I hope they throw you out soon, and I hope you die. I only hope I'll never see you again. [INA VOCALIZING] Good. Bend the knees slowly. And now, one more time. [INA VOCALIZING] Good. You're all doing very well and now... Hands up, who wants to dance a solo? Three hands I see. Who'll drop out? I will, Ina. INA: Neither of you will drop out? So, turn around and we'll draw a lots. Now, that's it. Now... You can turn around. Your solo this time. Okay, let's start from the beginning. [ORIENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] You danced beautifully. [CHUCKLES] Thanks. [SOBBING] COACH: Get ready. All set. [BLOWS WHISTLE] [CHILDREN CHEERING] -[APPLAUSE] -[CHEERING] COACH: That's good. Hava, eight-nine. Mira nine-one. Hava is the winner. COACH: Get ready! All set. [BLOWS WHISTLE] [ALL CHEERING] Amalya, seven-one. Michelle, seven-four. Terrific. Terrific. Terrific, Amalya. [CHILDREN CLAMORING] Terrific, Amalya. BOY: Yeah right, she was so good. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] COACH: Where's Aya? Aya, to the starting line. Come on, hurry, Aya! GIRL: Hana's gonna win! Aya, you ready? All this working, don't take it so seriously, it isn't the Olympics. You ready? All set. -[CHILDREN CHEERING] -GIRL: Hana! Come on, Hana! -GIRL: Aya! -[COACH BLOWS WHISTLE] [ALL CHEERING] Aya, eight-seven. Hana, eight-nine. COACH: Are you all ready? All set. [BLOWS WHISTLE] [ALL CHEERING] Roni! -[ALL CHEERING] -COACH: Roni, eight-three. Yazi, eight-five. GILA: Aya. What's wrong, don't you feel well? I've got a bit of a stomach ache. -Did you tell Ina? -Yes. Whose are those clothes you're carrying? -Zvika arrives tomorrow. -Honest? Would you like to clean his room tomorrow? -Oh, yes! -Good. [CHUCKLES] -Go and have a little rest. -Okay. Bye. Is Zvika coming today? AYA: Yes. NENI: Aya? AYA: Hi, there, Neni. Hello, Aya, how are you? Okay. Who you waiting for, Zvika? Yes, do you know what time he'll be coming? I don't know, we're in different camps. -You're hanging on? -Yes. See you. You've not eaten a bite. I don't feel hungry. Aya, the doctor says there's nothing wrong. Tummy ache is no reason to stay in bed. [INA SIGHS] INA: Hello, Zvika, good to see you. ZVIKA: Hello, Ina. Hi there, Aya. -What's wrong, are you sick? -Uh-uh. -Missing you parents? -Uh-uh. A little from time to time. -Anything else? -Uh-uh. I'm glad you've come, I've missed you an awful lot. I thought you were coming yesterday. [SIGHS] [SOBBING] ZVIKA: Why are you crying? [SOBBING] Why are you crying? [SOBBING] Where's the jar for the butterflies? In the bag. How about leaving them in peace today? No, there's a special one I wanna catch. Okay. Take it. Why not put your head here? ZVIKA: Won't you tell me why you're sad? When I'm a little bigger, I'll tell you why. Tell me, Zvika. Can you feel sad over something for always and always? ZVIKA: I don't know. They say time heals everything. But I'm not so sure that that is true. [CHILDREN SHOUTING] Children, sit down, we're about to start now. [CHILDREN CHEERING] -BOY 1: Shh. -BOY 2: Sit down. [MUSIC ON TV] [LAUGHTER ON TV] [ALL LAUGHING] -Can I sit here? -Yeah. BOY: There they are! GIRL: Yes, I see them. They've managed to find us. GIRL: They always follow us wherever we go. -BOY: Hey, come on. -[LAUGHING] [ALL LAUGHING] BOY: Hey, how about a jumping competition? GIRL: Yay, all right! [CHILD WHOOPING] BOY: I can't do that. [INDISTINCT TALKING] RONI: Argh! My hand! BOY: What happened? -It's my hand! -GIRL: Are you okay? -GIRL: What's the matter? -[MOANS IN PAIN] He's hurt bad, I think. BOY: Let's take him to the clinic. GIRL: Yes. Yes, quick! Let's pick him up. -Take it easy. -Careful. -Careful. -[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] -[GROANS] You're hurting me. -You're hurting him! Watch out. Watch out. Here he is. BOY 1: Will he be okay? BOY 2: Is he gonna be okay? Aya, move away. Move away. He'll be okay with us. [CAR REVVING] GIRL: I wanna go. BOY: Feel so sorry for him. -Come on, let's move it, huh? -ALL: Come on, let's move it. COACH: Stay on your marks. Catch it! Move it, come on! [ALL CLAMORING] COACH: That's it, okay. Now, pass it on. That's the way. Come on, that's it. Now, pass it back. Aya, back to your place. Come on. All right, that's it. BOY: Hey, Nicki, come with me a moment. GIRL: Come on, throw it. GIRL 1: Giora. GIRL 2: Come on, you can do it! [CHILDREN CLAMORING] [GROANS] You crazy? Don't play so rough. Who says I'm playing rough? Okay, be more careful, it's only a game. Oh, yeah, sure. Now, lay off. Don't try telling me to lay off, or I'll lay you out, but quick. Let's see you try. -Yeah, I'll take you on one hand. -Hey, what's up with you guys? -That's quite enough now. -Come on then. -You cripple! -I said that's enough! Yeah? Now, you will all go back to your classes, every one of you, you hear? ALL: Oh, no! [GROANING] -Quiet now. Quiet now. -BOY: That's not fair. If I stop the game, you can be sure there's a reason. [SOBBING] GIRL: I just can't believe I'll never see him again. BOY: Nor me, either. GIRL: Why did it have to be Neni? ADA: You mean if it was someone else, it won't be so bad? No, but... When Neni was here on Sabbath, he was saying to us he'd asked for a few weeks leave, so that he could come to the summer camp with us. Maybe they made a mistake. I just don't believe that it's true. You can be sure they check out thoroughly before telling us. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Are you all right? See ya. Did he tell you how it happened? I didn't ask him. He didn't say. -Okay, yeah, come on. -[CHILDREN CHATTERING] [GRUNTING] GIRL: Here, over here. Over here. Over here. SHEELA: It isn't right that you are playing. BOY: Tell us why not. You shouldn't be playing games when we are sad and mourning the dead. Mourning won't help bring him back to life, will it? No, but we should have respect for him. What good will our respect do for him now? Tell me that. [SOBBING] Girls never understand, it's impossible to explain to them. So it's up to you whether you decide to play with us or not. Come on, let's get on with the game. -GIRL: Yeah, pass the ball. -BOY: Yeah, come on. [BIRDS CHIRPING] AYA: Dear Zvika, each Friday we wait for you. And when you don't come, we're very sad. School is almost over and we're busy rehearsing for the annual play. I hope you'll be able to come to see it. I have a leading role. It's two weeks on Wednesday. See you. Aya. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] GIRL: Help me carry this. BOY: Oh, this is hard work. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] -[YELPS] -[GIGGLES] [CHUCKLING] Got you! Hana, you go and do some sawing and I'll take your place. I don't see why I should go. Don't try arguing with me. You know quite well Giora doesn't want to go with you. What's the problem? Both of you can help. There's no problem. HANA: It's about time you realize that you can't have everything you want. BOY: John. John, you just stepped on it. GIRL: Well, what about this color? -GIRL 1: Yeah, I like white. -[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] HANA: I just can't understand why everyone tries to get rid of me. Can't anyone I like love me for a change? [CHILDREN LAUGHING] -Hey, pass me the soap! -RONI: Aya! Aya! What is it? -Hurry up, it's your parents. -Oh, dear. -GIRL: Ooh, it's Roni. -[GIGGLING] GIRL 1: Hi, Roni. AYA: Daddy! -Oh! -Aya! Aya, my little one. -Oh, I've missed you so much. -Mommy. Oh, mommy. How well you look. -Sweetheart! -Honey! Oh, Mommy! Oh, Aya! [SIGHING] This, too. This is Aya's? You bought it with her last year. [BOTH CHUCKLING] And this as well. Must we really leave today? Yes. -That all? -Mmm-hmm. -Hey, Aya, Zvika's here. -Really? -I has just seen him. -That's great! Wait a sec, Aya. I've got to hurry or else I'm gonna be late. BOY: Come sit down, every mother's son and rehearse your part. Pyramus, you begin. GIRL: What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here so near the cradle of the fairy queen? What, a play toward? I'll be an auditor. An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause. BOY: Speak, Pyramus. Thisbe, stand forth. GIORA: Thisbe, the flowers of odious savors sweet... -[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] -GIRL: Odors! Odors! GIORA: Odors savors sweet. So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear. But hark, a voice! Stay but here a while. And by and by, I will to thee, appear. Is it true you love Dodo? She loves him, I know that. A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here. Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue, of colors like the red rose on triumphant brier. Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew, As true as truest horse that yet would never tire, -I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb. -[CROWD GIGGLING] If I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine. Oh, monstrous! Oh, strange! We are haunted! Pray, masters. Fly, masters. Help! Because I don't love Amalya anymore. I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round. Through bog, through bush, though brake, through brier. Sometimes a horse I'll be, sometime a hound, a hog, a headless bear, sometimes a fire, and neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar and burn, like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn. So if you still love me... O Bottom, thou art changed! What do I see on thee? What do you see? You see an ass head of your own, do you? So, if you still love me... Bless thee, Bottom. Bless thee. Thou art translated. I see their knavery. This is to make an ass of me, to frighten me, if they could. But I will not stir from this place, do what they can. I will walk up and down here and I will sing that they shall hear, I'm not afraid. The ouzel cock, so black of hue. With orange-tawny bill, The throstle with his note so true, the wren with little quill. What angel wakes me from my flowery bed? The finch, the sparrow, and the lark, The plainsong cuckoo gray, Whose note full many a man doth mark. And dares not answer "Nay." I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again. Mine ear is much enamored of thy note. So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape. And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me. On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee. Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays. Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful. Not so, neither. But if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn. Out of this wood do not desire to go. Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no. [AUDIENCE CHUCKLES] Tie up my love's tongue and bring him to my bower silently. GIORA: Hey, wait, Aya. I've got to go now, Giora. Aya. I'm leaving today. Oh, you're leaving, but why? Aya! Hello, Aya. It really was great. Aya, this is Abigail. Hello, Aya. Zvika's always talking of you. Aren't you glad your parents are back? Yes. So why the sad face? I must leave tonight. Will you come to visit us? Mmm-hmm. Will you come soon? Yes. You sure? Yes, my Abigail lives in Tel Aviv. When I go to visit her, I'll see you too. -Where is Aya? -Well, where is she, Roni? Don't know. -Ada, where is Aya? -ADA: Don't know. -There you are! -There she is! We were beginning to think you didn't want to come home. -[CHUCKLING] -INA: Aya! -Aya! -It's Ina! You pay us a visit soon. I'm coming back to the kibbutz again next year. Next year you're gonna be home with us. No, I'm coming back to the kibbutz. -We'll talk about that later. -Hear that, Gila? -[BOTH CHUCKLING] -Thanks, my friend. -Come and see you soon. -That's for sure. Bye, Gila. SHMIL: Now, off you go. -Goodbye. -Thanks again. Good journey. -Be good. -Bye-bye. [ENGINE STARTS] -Bye-bye. -Goodbye. -GIRL Bye. Bye. -BOY: Bye. See you. [ALL BIDDING FAREWELL] RONI: I'll miss you.
