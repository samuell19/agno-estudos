-Gedeone! -What? I'm cold. Come on, keep going! It'll warm you up. I'm a bit hungry, too. Think of tomorrow. There’s always a crowd in Caltabellotta. We’ll eat like kings. -And you better know your lines! -I know them. Ladies and gentlemen, today in your town, the great Gedeone, king of Sicilian strolling entertainers, prince of Comedia Del Arte, marvelous storyteller and dream merchant… "" Look. At least we'll be warm. What if it's a bear's cave? Stop going on about bears. There haven't been any in Sicily in ages! Look how beautiful it is. It looks like a cathedral. Almerina! Almerina! Gedeone! Gedeone! Go on, eat! What about you? Eat, I said. I'm saving myself for tomorrow. Caltabellotta is the international ravioli capital. They make it every possible way: with chestnuts, wild boar, ricotta, anchovies, hedgehogs… And earthworms? Divine! And sheep's eyes? Yes. They make ravioli with anything. They're incredible. But the best ones are made with tired kids' boogers. Come on, let's go to bed. What? I think there's someone… The famous ghosts of Demon Rock! Look. Madre mia! We woke you up. Forgive us! We're only passing through. If you like, we can very well… -But you see, it's cold outside. -Yes. Sorry. I didn't introduce myself: Gedeone, Cantastorie. The young lady and I travel the land, bringing a little joy, warmth and entertainment to those who hunger for it. Wait! -Almerina… -OK. We happen to have a fabulous story that seems to have been made just for you! That's right. An extraordinary story! Have a seat. It's not very comfortable, but have a seat. As you wish. Almerina… For you who love laughter, tears, legends, adventure, emotion… here is… The Bears' Famous Invasion of Sicily! THE BEARS' FAMOUS INVASION OF SICILY This happened a long while ago when beasts were good, men vile. Sicily was very different then. Majestic mountains which have since disappeared stood tall. But first, the hero of our epic. Almerina, if you please… Léonce, King of the Bears. Tall, strong, courageous and even rather smart. The son and grandson of kings, his son Tonio would… Yes, yes, we'll get to that, but hush! The story shall begin. Please, listen carefully. Here they come… Come on, jump in! Come on, catch me! -I'm going to win! -Wait for me, Dad! A fish! A fish? That's not how to catch a fish. Watch me. Follow the salmon. Very concentrated. Never take your eyes off it, and hup! Now, catch, Tonio! A bear never lets go of his fish. Go on! Never take your eyes off it… Never take your eyes off it. Never take your eyes off it… Never take your eyes off it… Dad… Dad! Tonio? Tonio… Tonio… Tonio… Tonio… Tonio… Tonio… Tonio… His Tonio had disappeared. But who had taken him? He looked everywhere, overturned every stone, traveled to each valley, and explored clearings, calling his name. With only his own echoes in reply, from the bottom of the gullies. What a misfortune for a father to lose his son. He sat and refused to move. Speechless, his heart broken, he gazed down over the valley. While behind him, his clan grew desperate. For a kingless tribe is like a fatherless child. Winter stretched its icy fingers over the mountain, Léonce remained seated on his hard, rocky throne, under the eyes of his despondent, starving clan… Talk to him. He'll listen to you. Tell him we're hungry, that we can't take any more. Meet Théophile. He is old, but wise. And King Léonce listens to him. Léonce… your bears are hungry. We can't hibernate on an empty stomach. You must do something. Look at the swirls of smoke. There's food in the valley among the men. You know, Léonce, when I was a young bear, long before you were born, I met a group of our kinfolk who'd lived in the valley. They said that not all men are our enemies. Some hunt us, yes. But others like to watch us dance. They even say men love us so much, they give cubs to their little ones to help them fall asleep. And who says Tonio isn't living amongst them? What? Tonio is surely down there. Tonio? What are we waiting for? Get up! Come on! Follow me, clan! We're off to the valley! Forward march! Imagine, Your Eminence, not one fine bear like you, but a thousand, ten thousand splendid creatures! A majestic winding fur snake. And in the lead, a bucked-up Léonce, filled once more with hope! Everyone was happy! The bears would eat, and Léonce would find his son again. Shrewd observation, young lady! But don't interrupt the storyteller. Where was I? Alas and alack, the bears knew nothing of the world they were heading towards: neither men nor their customs nor the sumptuous Palace. Nor the sumptuous Palace! -The Palace! -Yes, yes, sorry! Thank you! Nor the sumptuous Palace where the Grand Duke lived. This arrogant, cruel and very ugly tyrant who was obsessed with his clothes, gold, and wigs ruled over Sicily with an iron hand. No, no, no! Too dressy! What are you thinking, stupid donkeys? Now that's perfect. Grand Duke! Your Highness! Majesty! De Ambrosiis! How dare you interrupt my fittings? The stars, Your Excellency. The stars announce a catastrophe. Wild beasts will come down from the mountains to invade Sicily! We must act at once. Like the hail of toads you promise me every autumn on St. Zita's day. Sire, the stars are categorical. Powerful bears, far stronger than your army… Stinking beasts stronger than my soldiers? -You insult me, beanpole! -No, no… You bore me! Deal with it yourself. That's what I pay you for, magician. Use your magic wand. Ｎo way. Not my wand! I've exhausted it in your service. It only has 2 spells I'm saving for my old age. You contest my orders? Sire, the situation is grave! My hat! What have you done, you vile twig? Die! Vanish from my sight before I lose my temper! Enough! You forget to whom you are talking! A two-bit magician with a two-spell wand? Moron! Out of my sight! Don't say I didn't warn you! Don't say I didn't. A bear invasion! Well, now… You! My hunting hat! Thus, they set out, the Grand Duke and his troops, armed for combat, resolved to cause carnage, ready to kill without mercy any wildlife in sight… Halt! The beanpole was right! Théophile, you who know men, how does one address them? Hello." You must always say "hello". Then what? "Hello, there are 10,000 of us, we're hungry. Do you have something to nibble on?" Combat formation! I believe that men are like bears. There are good ones and bad ones. You mean some smell good and others smell bad? No, Babbon… What I mean, is that they are like us, only… Only not as hairy… Take aim! There they are! Look at those colors, those flags, those hats! Wow! They put on their finest apparel to greet us. Hello! No, Saltpetre, wait… Fire! Théophile! Break up! Run for cover in the trees! Run! Show no mercy! Slaughter them! Oh, slaughter them! So, did all the poor bears die? Some of them did, but these noble creatures were brave and strong! Caught off guard by the Grand Duke's treachery, they soon rediscovered their warrior instincts. Positions! Come on, Babbon! Show them what we can do! Yes, sir! Babbon was dauntless, loyal and ready to do anything to serve his king! The food was no cause to celebrate. But on the field deserted by the Grand Duke's army, the bears discovered many things in awe. How generous these men are! Look, they left us so many things. Saltpetre, an elegant and ambitious bear, was fascinated by men. Perhaps a little too much… Your victory is a great one, King Léonce. But it's not victory I'm looking for. It's my son. Good evening, heroic bear! Who are you? Professor De Ambrosiis, astrologer, prophet, magician… and friend of bears. Magician? What's that… a magician? What's that, a magician! Magic! The art of miracles! A gift in my family for 100 generations. You must have heard of my grandmother Saint Zara who saved Sicily from the Great Sea-Serpent? Oh yes, the Great Sea-Serpent. Of course. Exactly! You have before you the greatest magus who commands spirits, tides, stars and winds. My name is Léonce. King Léonce. King Léonce? A great king needs a great magician. My powers are at your service. With your magic, could you find someone who has disappeared? Yes, but it's below my level of genius. Your magic will help me find Tonio! -To-to-to… Who is Tonio? -My son Tonio whom the river took from me. My instinct tells me he's still alive. I'm not sure I'm the man for the job, Sire. I won't waste a spell to find a bear cub. Yes, you will. No, I won't. Yes, you will. -Oh, no. -Oh, yes. -No. -Yes. -I said no. -I said yes. -No. -Yes. Saint Zulma! What is that? What's going on? Alert! Alert! We're under attack! Babbon, Saltpetre, to your stations! Let me through! They were the Count de Molfette's terrible wild boars. Run! Bears don't run from wild boars. They're just hairy pigs! We'll all die! If we must die, let us die as bears! But I'm not a bear! Move aside, you bunch of oafs! Sporco porco sportico… Long live the Professor! Long live the bears' friend! Long live the Professor! Long live the bears' friend! My precious spell… My very own spell! Well, well, my dear flying beanpole, you turn my cousin Sire de Molfette's army into hot-air balloons? But, Sire! It was either that or die… Don't tempt me, magician! Give me one good reason not to cut this rope and watch you smash to the ground like an overripe zucchini! Wait… Give me a minute, I'll come up with something. Yes, yes… I know! We'll get rid of them! I'll make them die of fright! Fright… Yes, why not fright? I love… fear! Fear… Some mothers don't like people telling their children ghost stories. It depends on the ghosts. That's what I always say. But those at Demon Castle were particularly terrifying. Even skeletons' teeth shook when they saw them! So, this is what a human's lair is like? It's big! And the ceilings are so high! Get up. Get up. Come on, wake up! De Ambrosiis! De Ambrosiis! Hey Hey It echoes like at home. Stop! Where is the magician? Where's the feast he promised us? Is anyone here? -What's this? -Clouds? Shadows? Léonce! Oh, it's Théophile! No. What are you talking about? Yes! It's Théophile! And all our other friends! Old Théophile! So, you're not dead? I am, Léonce. I've gone over to the other side. It's simply that at Demon Rock, the two worlds can meet! Then come into my arms! No way! I don't believe it! It's not working, it's not working! Indeed! It's not working very well. You're losing your touch, Magician! You're here, Your Highness? You were to make them die of fear. Look, they're dancing! They fear nothing, Your Majesty! Neither ghosts nor the Devil! The Devil! Good idea! You know where you must bring them! Oh, no, Sire! Oh, yes! The Three Peaks! Oh, not the Three Peaks! Yes! And it's your last chance before the gallows! Tell me, old Théophile… What's it like being dead? Curious… but not unpleasant. You're nowhere and… everywhere at once. Everywhere? Then you know where Tonio is? Rest assured, Léonce, your son is not among us. That means he's still alive. Help me find him, please. My King, the deceased don't meddle in the affairs of the living. It's up to you, and you alone, to find Tonio. But Théophile, he's my son! My only son! Listen… you're a good king, Léonce, and a valiant bear. So I will tell you… Your son Tonio is at the T-T-T… At the Tribunal? Tyrol? The tailor's? Tibet? Trampoline? Telephone? Togo? Tennis? Toilet? Three Peak Castle Inn! What's this now? The Three Peak Castle Inn? The region's most renowned inn. Your Tonio is surely there. The innkeeper loves little bears! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! Right now! Get up, bears! Wake up! C'mon, wake up! Don't you find this magician odd? Well, he saved us from the wild boars and brought Théophile back to us. Look, Babbon, have some faith in men. OK, but counting on someone that skinny to find us grub… All you ever think about is food! I'm not deaf! You walking corpse, what misfortune brings you? Greetings, Master Troll. Delighted to see you looking so well! I asked you what you want. I hear that my son Tonio is here. Who's this, then? A friend of mine and his clan. I've brought them for lunch. Tell them to sit down. We'll take care of them. Like I've got nothing better to do! They come at all hours of the day. People think they can do whatever they like! Why didn't he answer me about Tonio? He hates being disturbed while he's cooking. Leave it to me. We'll talk to him later. Tell your bears to have a seat. Yes, but… Charming, that innkeeper, don't you think? Tonio? Tonio? What do you want me to do with it? Bear meat is tough. But they're real mountain bears, raised on berries and honey. We'd have to boil them for hours before they're edible. You who love to eat! Bear-o-buco is a real treat! Onion, garlic, white wine, a pound of butter, lemon zests… Listen, skeleton, since there are so many of them, it's simple: -it's a dish for the cat. -What? The cat? Yes, the cat! Marmoset the Cat! He'll love it! Troll, the innkeeper, was not only the most loathsome ogre in all of Sicily, but he also had the power of transformation. Marmoset! Be careful! So long, bears! It's a massacre. I know what I must do. No, I'll take care of the kitty. Babbon! Babbon! Present arms! Sire! Wait, wait! -Your Majesty! -Well? Mission accomplished, Your Highness, Marmoset devoured the bears. Another victory won thanks to my military genius! I invite you to the theater in my box. That's too great an honor! When you can make someone happy… Do you like the circus, my dear beanpole? circus? Because I'm wild about it! Stop! Well, soldier, still nothing? Nothing, sir! That's something in itself! Precisely, sir! Better nothing than something. It's true, there's something reassuring about nothing. Now that is really something! Stay here. I will go talk to them. Something odd has broken away, sir. Listen to me! I am looking for my son… -Is he saying something? -I can't hear a thing. Fire at will! They're crazy! They fired before I finished. We even got rid of the monster for them! And once again, they block our way! If it's war they want… Tragedy! Comedy! There, the bears prepare for battle while here, artists bring the house down. How I'd love to be this ballerina! Nothing could be simpler! Let's say she's you and we give her your name. -Almerina! -Thank you! My pleasure. Who's the cub? Beat the drum, you'll find out! Charge! Everyone, with me! What a sight! Are you having fun? I love the circus. Our turn next. Ready? Sure, Almerina. Don't worry. And whatever you do, never look down. Hey, I'm no scaredy-cat! Sire! The bears have taken the citadel! They're entering the town! I thought they were all dead! Brothers, human brothers, have no fear. We come with peaceful intentions. We never wanted war. -I only come searching for my… -Dad! -Tonio? -Dad! Tonio! My son! Tonio! My son! Now… go search for your son in hell! Tonio! De Ambrosiis! You, the magician… You make ghosts dance and wild boars fly… Save my son, save my child, save Tonio. Save Tonio! Save Tonio, Professor! Save Tonio, Professor! Save Tonio! Please, Professor, listen to your heart. My last spell! Farété… finkété… gamorré… abilé… fabilé… dominé! Dad…? Tonio? My Tonio, you're alive! Look, he's alive! Tonio’s alive. Thus, our tale ends when men and bears at last unite. De Ambrosiis lost his spell. But Léonce found his son at last. The liberated population explodes with joy. And choose Léonce as their new ruler. Long live the king! Long live the king… Our friends have won. The tyrant is punished. And remember… Théophile was telling the truth: Tonio was at the T-T… Theater! The riddle is solved, thanks, kid! He who did not enjoy the tale of the bears, may he raise his hand and ask for repair! What's he doing? He's laughing. So that's how men tell the story? Do bears talk? Because for us bears, the story doesn't end there. There is a sequel. We would be honored to hear it, Your Eminence. I'd be happy to tell you, but I'm hungry. Would you have a little something to eat? This is all we have left. Take it, we gladly give it to you. Everything you said is true. Léonce became King of Sicily. And his son, Prince Tonio, the ""miracle cub"" as he was called, grew into a fine young bear. Fikété, fakété… Fikété, fakété… This wand! I'll never succeed! Don't say that, Godfather. You're a magical genius. Bah! A magician without a wand! He who looks for his donkey is often on it. "" ""He who looks for his donkey is often on it."" You taught me: we often look for things under our noses! Under our noses? Under our noses… Under our noses! Oh no, I'm late! Ciao, Godfather! -Morning madame. -Mister. Hello! My pastries are hot out of the oven! Thanks! It was what we called the Age of Honey. Men and bears got along so well, Sicily was prosperous, and peace seemed as if it would reign forever. Hello! Attention! At ease! Tonio! Young Prince! You're late again! Very fine hat, Saltpetre! Is it Christmas already? One doesn't keep the King waiting. Is that Almerina? Yes, she was beautiful, Almerina… Tonio? Tonio? No, I'm the royal pizza delivery boy! That's lucky, I'm very hungry. I'll eat you up! -You’ll have to catch me. -I will! Well, come on then, Almerina! Follow my voice. -Wait. -Warmer! Am I? Over here. I know you're there, naughty little bear! Thought you could escape? A kiss, good-for-nothing! I'm terribly sorry, Your Majesty. Don't worry. But you're right, Tonio is a good-for-nothing. He's impossible! Always late! Surprise! So, you mix me up with my father? I'm not that fat! I've waited hours! -One doesn't keep… -…the King waiting, I know. Come on. Positions! One doesn't keep the King waiting! Look and learn. The bear is an animal of nature. We mustn't lose certain instincts. The water is a bit cold though. Look. Supple paws… Snout forward… -I'm an animal! -That's it! Pull! Strike with your paw! But it's moving. You never let go of the fish! Try again. Look. See, it's easy. And it's delicious. Dad, salmon is better smoked. You spend too much time with men. Start again. One, two… It's working again! My magic wand! I'm a magician once more! Fikété, fakété, wakété The return of the magic wand! What a good idea! With your permission, we'll add it to our show. Everyone’s happy: bears, men, magician! -Their happiness didn't last long. -No? No. Once the wand had been repaired, it disappeared at once. Disappeared? How? It was stolen. A new mystery, how exciting. That's the art of storytelling, Your Lordship. That day, Léonce summoned his people to the great royal square. And that's when he made his first mistake. My dear humans, this is a grave moment! Have I not brought you peace? Yes. Have I not taught you the bears' greatest quality: -honesty? -Yes. Now, for the first time since the start of my reign, a foul act has been committed. Someone has stolen Professor De Ambrosiis's magic wand! Yes. So could the thief raise his hand? Fine. I give the thief three days to come forward. Otherwise, everyone shall be punished. -Justice! -Why? Very well, four days! But if the thief has not come forward by then, I will consider you all responsible. Each and every one of you shall pay one gold ducat to the magician! See that, son? That's how a king addresses his people. Half his people, you mean. Not many bears. It's not fair. Not fair? Me?! What do you know about it? Go back to your games! -But, Dad… -Go play! De Ambrosiis, my friend, hear that? I said what had to be said. If I may, Sire, Tonio's right. Your speech was only to men. Why not to bears? Because bears don't steal. Do you really think bears are above suspicion? Well, what bear would steal a magic wand? You don't know your people. Sir! Is that any way to speak to the King? You overstep… Yes, I overstep! -You overstep? -Yes, I overstep! I know things about bears that'd make you shudder! I'd rather say nothing. Please! We're listening. I have too much respect for you. Coward! Won't even dare to state his opinions! I'm a coward? A slanderous coward! Your insinuations… Am I the one who stole my own wand? Say it, you social-climbing bear! -Charlatan! -Stinking beast! -Has-been! -Filthy, muddy bear! Clown! Enough! Beanpole! For the first time, King Léonce, faced with all these problems, thought that life was simpler in the mountains. Léonce… why did you abandon us? Where are you going, Léonce? Come back. Come back, Léonce. Your Majesty. Your Majesty… Your Majesty? Your Majesty? Sire, wake up! Is it Tonio? No, Your Majesty. It's the bank! The Grand Universal Bank's been robbed. What is going on, Saltpetre? It's called a break-in, Majesty. No, no, what is going on in our kingdom? Who could be evil enough to steal public property? Wait! I think our fine sleuths have found something. -What is that? -A collar stud. But not just any collar stud! -It's De Ambrosiis's coat of arms? -I fear so. Why should a magician who can have anything he wants rob a bank? Your Majesty, you don't know men's thirst for wealth! So, do what you must, Saltpetre. By royal decree, you are under arrest. Saltpetre? I want to talk to Léonce. He's the one who ordered your arrest. It's not possible! It's a terrible mistake! Let go of me! So, the King puts the magician in prison? That's the way Léonce was. His duty came before friendship. But he believed Saltpetre? That's not fair! Oh, no, it's not fair! That's a bit much. Oh, it wasn't for want of trying to make him understand. Dad! What have you done? My duty as King. By throwing my savior in jail? The law is the same for all. His crime is unforgivable! Why would he rob the bank? It's absurd! You think you know men because you dress like them and grew up among them. They kidnapped you to make you dance in a circus! Because my father wasn't capable of protecting me! I conquered Sicily to find you. And look at you! You'd rather be a man. You're not even a bear! Incapable of catching salmon! Go! Get out of my office! I have work to do. Well, what did he say? Nothing. -Nothing? -He doesn't understand. Stubborn as an old mountain bear! I think he hates men. -No… -He doesn't listen to anyone. Feeling sorry for yourself won't help the Magician. You bears give up easily! Do you have an idea? Professor… Children! I'm the victim of an appalling conspiracy! You must believe me! Godfather, we do. That's why we're here. To help you. They locked me up to silence me! After my wand was stolen, I decided to investigate. My investigation led me to Artichoke Park. And suddenly, I discovered a mysterious palace, all lit up, that I'd never seen before. I'm sure they saw me. And that's why I'm locked in here. But we're free! We'll investigate. Yes, we'll get you out of here. Be careful. At night, it is a very strange place… It's amazing. Look. Do you think this is it? The world is full of mysteries. The things we think we see aren't always what they seem. That's the lesson Tonio learned that night. And he paid quite dearly for it. Over there! No, it's not a big palace! It's the professor's telescope! The palace! We must tell your dad right away. Look out. Give me your pot, Albertine Give me your honey Ah, beauty. Let's take a look. Miss, sir, welcome. Please wait here. I'll be right back. What is this place? -Had you already heard of it? -No, never. But I don't like it here. Fikété! Fakété! Gomoré! With a bit more training, I will be able to master the occult powers! Yes! What is it? The young prince is at the door with the little dancer. The young prince? Stop them. Don't let them go away! My little valets! Deliver this letter to the Palace for the King, in person! It's dubious here. Let's… Miss, sir, the welcome drink… A club tradition. The Modern Bear's drink! Don't drink that. It's strong! But it's good. Isn't it? Honey liqueur, sir… -Not finishing yours? -No… -We must get out of here! -Wait… The modern bear's thirsty! Of course, sir. These glasses are tiny. We'll fix that. Follow me. What're you doing? Well, do what you want. I'm leaving. You annoy me! Almerina, where are you going? It is strange here. Oh, you haven't seen anything yet, sir. 'Evening, miss! Crossing Artichoke Park all alone at this time of night… That's very inadvisable! Don't you start, too! Come inside. We'll call you a cab. Yeah, right… She's getting away! Out of my way, you! Where is she? Your Majesty! Majesty! Wait! Majesty! Wait, it's Tonio… Majesty! Majesty… Getting me out of bed is becoming a habit, Saltpetre! Always for the same reason, Sire. The unremitting fight against crime knows no rest! Do come in, Your Majesty. Albertine What is this? It's the King. Now everything on red. I've decided to put it all on red. C'mon, go on! Everything on 7. Roll it. Roll it… Roll it for me. Make Tonio's day! Hey, go on, champion! Who's the champion? Honey liqueur! Thanks! Dad?! You see, you're a modern bear, too! It's the first time I've come here. Ah, Uncle De Ambrosiis's hot tips! The magician brought you here? No, no, you've got it all wrong. He was right, because your bears… your plantigrades… are degraded! They may have been hungry, but now they're thirsty! Look at you… Look at this place! It spells the end for bears. What a spectacle! You, the Prince! You should set an example! And so should I! But, Dad… You leave me no choice. Guards! Throw my son in prison! Tonio… It was a very difficult decision to make, Your Highness. But so very courageous of you. My own son… That Almerina is a disastrous influence on Tonio. I never want to hear of her again. Your story's horrible. Didn't King Léonce love his son? Maybe he loved him too much, who can say? Tonio and De Ambrosiis rotted in jail, and poor Almerina was refused entry to the palace. Saltpetre now had a free hand. A dark shadow stretched over the kingdom. Oh my god. A statue of Saltpetre? -It makes no sense. -On the contrary! The statue explains everything! If the statue is of Saltpetre and not of Léonce, it means Saltpetre plans on taking Léonce’s place. -We must act! -Save the throne! Save the King! Save Dad! Oh, yes, but how? Children, there is a solution. But I'm warning you, it is terrible. The price to pay is astronomical. Will you do anything to save the kingdom? Yes! In that case, I need a young girl with plenty of pluck and a good memory. This gold key belonged to my grandmother, Saint Zara, a mystic magician from the olden days. Run to the chapel that bears her name! Above the altar, in the tabernacle which you'll open with this key, you'll find… one of the Great Serpent's baby teeth! You must remember the words I say very precisely… Great Serpent of the deep Whom Saint Zara sent to the next world Great Serpent of the deep Whom Saint Zara sent to the next world Echo of deep mysteries Come for your tooth From the black abyss Come deliver our sons Bring flowers, tears Destruction and resurrection! Great Serpent of the deep Whom Saint Zara sent to the next world Echo of deep mysteries Come for your tooth Great Serpent of the deep Whom Saint Zara sent to the next world Echo of deep mysteries Come for your tooth From the black abyss Come deliver our sons Bring flowers, tears Destruction and resurrection! She did it! What have you done? Don't worry! Keep your head down! Here we'll have the delegation of grape-pickers from Catania. Here, the choirs of girls from San Lorenzo. On the inauguration day… Léonce! The Sea-Serpent is attacking! The Sea-Serpent? At long last, a task for a bear! Come on! Come on, climb up, Tonio! -Almerina. -Tonio. Let's get my wand. It alone can save us! Where is it? I have an idea. Cast off! Saltpetre, what are you doing? On board! No, Sire, my place is here. Think of the continuity of state. Should any misfortune occur… Well, stay where you are, Saltpetre. Unfurl the sails! Let us through! Where's Saltpetre? Up there! Look! Capulé! Kapélé! Toukouré! Kétaré… Give me my wand back! Oh, no! No! Give it back to me, it's mine. I'll rid us of this monster and I shall become King! You think you can master magic? It takes more than a wand to do that. It takes a real magician! I'll make you Chamberlain. We'll rule together. You, me, us. You won't regret it. Fakété, fikété… Ooh! Jump, Professor! OK, hold tight! On my command… Fire! Don't let it get away! Where is it? Shoot! Aim for the heart, it's the only way to kill it! Tonio! Dad… Dad! -Tonio. -Tonio. Oh, no. Dad! Tonio… No! The heart, Tonio! Hit the heart! Hit the heart! Tonio… Dad, no! No! Tonio. That evening, the town's bells tolled. Is Léonce going to die? He called for his son and all his old companions. Don't die, Your Majesty. I depart content, child. My son is a bear. De Ambrosiis, I ask for your forgiveness. I misjudged you. Let me try to… Keep your spells for men and let me leave as a bear. Brothers, step forward and listen. Leave this town. Throw away the gold, the guns, the finery… Return to our mountains. Tonio… Dad? You are their leader now. The bravest of bears. Lead our people. Bring them home, where rivers flow, and life is simple… Only Saltpetre who adopted all their vices shall stay among men. We… have no more to do here. Well, Léonce, my friend, come on, let's go.
