(film reel rattling) (cheese splattering) (lively music) - Since my appointment as minister of economics, the situation has improved to a considerable extent. These figures are naturally merely indicative. Never the less, we may safely envisage a definite reduction in our expenses, and particularly- - Good, good, prepare a report for our next meeting. - Very well. - And about your department Rombard, what's the situation? - Well, I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear, very quiet. Very quiet indeed, Mr. President. Ever since the last executions in public, there has been no serious opposition at all. The number of arrests has decreased considerably. Only 87 for this month, as opposed to 150 last month, which I think is a record indeed. - And what about Vogel? - I don't understand why you attach so much importance to him. He's only a small-time, two-bit lawyer anyway. He only joined the opposition to get himself talked about. - Mr. President, if you don't mind. - But of course my dear Helga. We know how well and efficiently you organized the propaganda meetings. And how you eradicated the followers of that Vogel. - It's precisely that which worries me. General Gomez's enthusiasm is completely unwarranted. Our enemies are going over to Vogel! - A handful of agitators, taken in by a myth. Anyway, Vogel has skipped. - That's not so! He held a political rally the day before yesterday, just 30 kilometers away. And after that, dozens of young people joined up with his party. - Yes, of course. The trouble is that your phantom lawyer was reported at the same time in three or four different places. All of them imaginary. (Helga sighing) - There's an officer here who has seen him, Captain Hugo Lombardi. Do you want to hear his report? He has a lot of important information. - Utterly useless. I wouldn't know what to do with information from an unreliable source. Why didn't he arrest him? - [Helga] Mr. President! - I know Captain Lombardi. He's an excellent officer. General Gomez will talk to him later on, thank you, Helga. Now for our next item. Wait a minute! You're an excellent auxiliary, Helga. But like all women, you know nothing of politics. Sit down! - I thought that you were more energetic, Steiner! We must break up this revolt before it starts. (Gomez whispering) - All right my dear Helga. We'll give you the means to fight against those rebels as you wish. There is a fortress at Stilberg where we imprison our political prisoners. You can go there and take command of it. And now Gomez, let me have the rest of your report, if you please. (footsteps tapping) - Wait for me. (footsteps tapping) Didn't things go as planned with you? - No, Gomez wants to get rid of me. They've given me a miserable assignment but I'll fix him! - You want me to take care of Gomez? - Yes, but after my own fashion. Prepare a report on him. - Sure. - Steiner is a puritan. - I know that. - If Gomez were to be involved in a sex scandal, Steiner would fire him. You take care of that. Then, I'll have you appointed to Stilberg. That's a promise. (footsteps tapping) - Sir. - I think you acted very wisely in sending away that Helga. Her ambitions know no limits. Now my information is- - I too have my sources of information. I'm very careful, down there she'll have a lot of things to do rather than treason against me. As for you now- - Now listen, I wish to be of service. - I'm sure of that. I think perhaps the best thing for you would be another assignment. The embassy in Paris, why not? - I shall try to prove worthy of Your Excellency's, trust. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (soft music) (water splashing) (birds chirping) - [Soldier] Come on, get a move on! (water splashing) (birds chirping) - Those rebellious bitches! It'll do them good to do a little bit of hard labor. - Some of the girls have never been active politically. - But their relations and friends have, and that's enough. The president is quite right. Anyone who does not support the government, is an enemy! - You know, Helga, people are saying that soon the country will be one big work camp. That way there'll be no problem of unemployment in the future. - I want you to come with me. And I'd advise you to watch that tongue of yours. It's people like you who interfere with what we're doing. (engines rumbling) They all hate me but at least they obey. You hate me also, don't deny it. Get out! (Helga sighing) (gentle music) (Helga breathing heavily) (engines rumbling) (tires squealing) (upbeat music) - I must go now. I must join the convoy before dawn breaks. (engines rumbling) (tires squealing) (rooster crowing) - [Soldier] Come on, get going there, come on! Step lively, you're not here for fun and games you know. Get on. - [Sergeant] Come on. Get moving. Form a line. A line I said! (birds chirping) (chickens clucking) (cow lowing) (Doc laughing) - Sergeant. - [Sergeant] Hi there, Doc. - [Doc] Nice bunch. (men laughing) - [Sergeant] Take her along. - [Prisoner] No, no, I don't want to, leave me alone! - Is that in order? You're behaving like a swine, leave her alone! - So, the little lady doesn't like it, hey? You're the sensitive type. Hold it! All right, she doesn't have to go. But you'll go in her place, go on! (soldier chuckling) (Sophie whimpering) (birds chirping) No, let me, Doc. (men chuckling) (Sergeant whistling) - There, you'll see, vintage stuff. But I wonder what your commander would say if she heard about this? She doesn't look easygoing, that Helga. But don't worry, Sergeant, Doc knows how to keep quiet. - It's in your interest, Doc, if I don't talk about this deal. - Me, I'd never tell tales. I'm as silent as a grave. Go. (Doc chuckling) (rooster crowing) (birds chirping) (Doc chuckling) (cow lowing) (Doc chuckling) - No. (Sophie whimpering) (Sophie screaming) No! Leave me alone! (Sophie screaming) No! (lively music) No! No! No, no! No! No! (Sophie whimpering) (hooves clattering) (cow lowing) (Sophie whimpering) No! (Sophie whimpering) No. No, no! (Sophie whimpering) No! (Sophie shrieking) (Sophie whimpering) (lively music) (engines rumbling) (rooster crowing) (engines rumbling) (birds chirping) (engines rumbling) - [Soldier] Get on out of that truck! Come on, make it snappy! Come on! Hurry up, come on you sluts, get on with it! Come on, move faster! Come on, get on with it. (cutlery clinking) - It's all your fault, Sophie. You shouldn't have interfered. - Haven't you had enough? We are like slaves, and we have to let that stinking swine make love to us. That's no life. - Pipe down you girls, or else. - Oh, shut up Sophie, you'll get us into worse trouble. - Anyway, if we have to do it with Doc or the others, it's the same thing. It's less tiring than forced labor. - We're not talking about you. Since you've become Helga's chick, you don't work anymore. - Shut your trap, instead of being jealous, you'd better not talk. - You shut your mouth. You've found the easy way out like Franca. - Me, the easy way? Take that, you slut! (women screaming loudly) - No, no, no, come along, leave 'em alone. Let's let the girls have a work out. (Hugo chuckling) (women screaming loudly) (Hugo chuckling) - Quiet! Stop it! Stop it right now! - [Jennie] Let go, you bitches, God damn. - I want order here! (Helga breathing heavily) What's got into you? You probably don't get enough exercise. That's it, double work detail for everyone! Understand? Those three there, they need calming down. To the showers! - [Hugo] Come on, move, you two. - No, no! - Come on. - [Jennie] Leave me alone. - Come on, let's go, I said let's go, hey! - [Prisoner] Get your hands off me! - You too, move, when I say move, you move! Move it! - Leave me alone! - [Prisoner] Oh, stop it. - Seeing as you're unable to behave yourselves properly from now on, there will be no talking at meal times. And the first one to disobey, will get eight days solitary. (prisoners shrieking) (water splashing) - [Jennie] Leave me alone, you animal! Stop it! Stop it! (prisoners shrieking) (water splashing) - Come on. - No, stop it, you animal, stop it! (water splashing) (prisoner gasping) - Undo your dresses. Come on, hurry up! - Useless, I'll never take part in your loathsome games. You disgust me. - You'll change your mind soon enough! Take them to the cells! Are you cold, or are you frightened? - Cold, I'm frozen. - Perfect, we'll warm you up. Guard! Take her to the cells. (prisoners shrieking loudly) - [Prisoner] Let me go! I'm not gonna go anywhere! (prisoners shrieking loudly) - [Soldier] Come on, I'm gonna teach you to be a good girl. Come on. (prisoners shrieking loudly) Get in there! (prisoners shrieking loudly) Get in. (somber music) (Helga sobbing) (footsteps tapping) (gate rattling) - That one. - [Prisoner] No, let go of me. No, I don't want to! I'll do it myself. - Go on! Quickly. (prisoner shrieking loudly) (whip cracking) (Helga laughing) (footsteps tapping) (Helga sighing) (engines rumbling) (birds chirping) - General condition good? - Normally developed for her age, nothing to report. - Strong enough to work? - Yes, get dressed. - Kitchen detail. - Kitchen details, go on, hurry up, go on. - Yes. - Who's next? - Alicia Klein. - [Doctor] Which one is it? - That one. - So, you don't know your own name? Come along. Take off your dress. Quick, hurry up. Take off that dress, what are you waiting for? Her name is Alicia did you say? - [Hugo] Yes. - All right, Alicia. Breathe deep. Breathe out. All right. Yeah. (Elisabeth whimpering) - [Elisabeth] No. No. (Elisabeth gasping) - She's all right, go. - Anything special? - Perfectly sound. You can assign her to any work detail where she's needed. - Tree felling job. - That's enough, go. Who made that noise just now? All right, come here, we'll take care of you right away. - Come on, get up, move it! Get over here and get undressed. Be quick. Hey. - Come on, I'm waiting. (footsteps tapping) - Elisabeth Vogel. Well, well Elisabeth Vogel. The daughter of our unconquerable enemy. I suppose he's still in hiding. - That's enough! I realize I'm a prisoner, but that's no reason to treat me just like an animal. Are you satisfied with your medical check? If you've looked at me long enough, I'd like to be able to get dressed. - As intractable as your father, hey? I'd advise you to follow regulations. We don't have any regard for the daughter of a rebel here. The next one! (soft music) - That evening was so wonderful, my last time with Jonathan. We were going to get married. Then they arrested him. - It's not as bad as I feared. They give you good wine, music and flowers. I'm surprised. - That's what you think, right? You know what today is? It's the anniversary of the inauguration of the president. We've been ordered to celebrate. But the rest of the time it's pure hell. (women chattering softly) - What do you mean by hell? I've only just arrived. - 10 hours of exhausting work. The toughest details. The slightest complaint they throw you into the cells. Not to mention Doc, the farmer. An old debaucher who bribes the guards to let him make love to us whenever he wants to. - And the girls let him, without protesting? - It's better than being flogged by Helga. Stilberg lives up to its reputation. - [Guard] Parties over, get into bed. Lights out in five minutes. (women chattering softly) - You see? They're subdued. You'll be like them. - And you? - Me? No. I've one idea in my head, to escape. (footsteps tapping) - Well, Jennie, one might think that you're in no hurry to go to bed. Come with me. Two of my officers are waiting. They want to finish the anniversary party in pleasant company. (birds chirping) (engines rumbling) - [Soldier] Waiting for a personal invitation? (engines rumbling) (phone ringing) - What is it? I told them not to disturb me. - [Guard] Excuse me madam, I want to report that your horse is saddled. - Will you take him out for a gallop? I'm not going out today. (birds chirping) (engines rumbling) (cow lowing) (rooster crowing) - Come on, move on. Get in line. Come on. (birds chirping) (Doc chuckling) (Doc laughing) - Greetings, how are things, Sergeant? - All right. (rooster crowing) - That's a nice piece. New girl? - Yeah. You, off to the stable. - What do I have to do there? Milk the cows? I don't know how to. - Don't worry, you've got all that it takes for the job. Now get on! I said get on! Get in there, get in there! You'll see, they're gonna teach you to obey orders here. You understand? - Come. Well then, is it the vintage stuff? - Yes. Doc, when will you get it into your head that you need a new lock? - [Doc] Never. - [Sergeant] One of these days it won't work anymore. - [Doc] Oh, yes it will. - [Sergeant] It's an antique. - [Doc] Well, there's only one key. - Only one key? No, I get it, it's so no one but you can get in. (men chuckling) Hey, that'll be three for the new girl. - You're kidding? - That makes it another bottle. - Thanks. - That's very expensive. - I hope she's worth all that. - Don't worry. Come on. (Doc chuckling) (birds chirping) - [Elisabeth] What do you want? What do you want from me? - [Doc] Yes, yes. - What is it? - Come on. Don't get mad! (Elisabeth shrieking) I won't do you any harm, my pretty one. Yes, my lovely pretty one. (Elisabeth shrieking loudly) (hands slapping) Slut! Now you'll pay for that. - [Elisabeth] Swine! - Hey, guards, come here! Come on, give me a hand, she's a real tigress. - [Guard] What seems to be the trouble? - She deserves a good hiding for insubordination. - [Guard] That's all? Take hold of her. (Elisabeth shrieking) (guards chuckling) - Bastard! (Elisabeth moaning) (footsteps tapping) (phone ringing) - Yes, what is it? - [Guard] Your orders have been carried out. Elisabeth Vogel is locked up in cell number three. - Thanks. (soft music) (Helga moaning) (footsteps tapping) (gate creaking) Well, you see what happens for being so obstinate? You haven't been here 24 hours and already you're in the dungeon. - I suppose you think that I was going to let them rape me! - You were surely exaggerating. I've never had any complaint about the doctor's behavior in all of the time I've been here. - Whether you believe it or not, I'm telling the truth. - You're charming, you know? Quite delightful. It would really be a shame to turn you over to that lout. Just this once, I'll overlook your behavior. But I hope you won't be ungrateful. You'll come along with me to my bedroom. - No, what do you take me for? Do you think I'm one of those girls who goes to bed with everyone? - How dare you refuse. You'll see who's master here soon enough! (whip cracking) (footsteps tapping) (footsteps tapping) (Elisabeth whimpering) Go on. (Elisabeth shrieking) - No! Leave me alone! (Elisabeth screaming) Oh, no! (birds chirping) (footsteps tapping) (Elisabeth sobbing) No, leave me alone! I beg you, I beg you, don't touch me! - Shh. (Elisabeth sobbing) No, no, don't be afraid, don't cry. You mustn't be afraid of me. (Elisabeth whimpering) (Elisabeth shrieking) I'm awfully sorry. I know it hurts but I must clean up your wounds. Did they flog you? They're sadistic brutes. (Elisabeth moaning) - But who are you? You seem to be different from the others. Why are you with them? - I'm a friend of your fathers. Unfortunately, I can't do very much for you. Only give you some advice. - Advice you say? - Yes. You won't be able to stand much more of their treatment. And there's worse. For your own benefit, I think that... That you'd do better not to turn down Helga. (soft music) (engines rumbling) (footsteps tapping) (birds chirping) - Thank you. - I must leave now. I'll come back here this evening. Think it over. Helga is the queen bee here. - Thank you, John. But I really don't know where I am. I feel as if I'm living in a dream. I hate hypocrisy, but what can I do? - Be brave. (footsteps tapping) (birds chirping) - You? Did you ask to see me? - Yes. - Come closer. - I want to apologize for yesterday. I'm so sorry to have behaved so stupidly towards you. - It's I who is sorry. I only wanted to teach you a lesson. All men are swine. (soft music) - What's the matter? - Shh! - [Jennie] Were you with the other detail today? - Yes, is that all you want to know? Let me sleep, I'm worn out. - [Jennie] Was Elisabeth there too? - Elisabeth, no, is that all you wanted to know? - [Jennie] Yes. - Go to bed. (gentle music) - It was wonderful. You'll see, Elisabeth darling, you won't be unhappy here at Stilberg. - I'm sure I won't, but I'll always be a prisoner here, won't I? - Yes, mine, but I won't be a chain only a necklace. (birds chirping) - Hello, John. - [John] Hello. - What's the matter? - [John] You and that Helga. You and she are together all the time now. - But I don't understand. It was you who advised me to be docile and submissive. Don't you remember? - Yes, but there are limits. I must talk to you Elisabeth. Come to the stables tonight at nine o'clock sharp. - Elisabeth. Coming? - Sure. (birds chirping) (logs clanking) - I hope you aren't still worrying about your protege. - Fat dirty slut. - You shut up. You're just jealous because she's taken your place in Helga's bed. - Anyway, she avoids all the hard labor. - I'm sure she's some idea in her head. Ludwig Vogel's daughter wouldn't behave like that without reason, it's not possible. - How bold. She's only got one idea in that little head of hers. And that's to keep her body safe in the arms, in the arms of Helga. - [Sophie] Between her sheets you mean? - Come in. What do you want, I'm very busy. Leave me alone, I've far too much work to catch up with. - You've changed, Helga. You're not the same anymore. - No, Hugo, it's the situation that has changed. I must alter all my plans. - [Hugo] Plans regarding Elisabeth Vogel, am I right? - You mind your own business if you please. Elisabeth Vogel could be very useful to us. If Vogel found out that she's in our hands He'd try to liberate her. Then all we'd have to do is capture him. (Hugo chuckling) - You've always got an answer for everything. All right. What about tonight? - No, I've got a mission for you. - [Hugo] A mission? - You must organize a patrol right away. And then take it to an objective that I'll give you. (hay crunching) (Elisabeth gasping) - Don't worry, Elisabeth, no one is watching you. You're Helga's favorite so then. - John, one would think that you have some personal involvement. - Yes, I have. - Now don't tell me that a member of the party, a puritan, can be involved with a rebel. (gentle music) (hay crunching) - You're nothing but a dirty bitch, just like the rest of them. All right, I know what I'm going to do with you. It's eight hours of hard labor! Go to your dormitory! (hay crunching) As for you, John, do I have to repeat the regulations? There will be no fraternization with the prisoners! - Except where it concerns you, dear Helga. - One more word out of you, and I'll bust you too! Get out! (hay crunching) - There, in with you. (Elisabeth gasping) Get to bed. - So, sweetie pie's in the doghouse. (Elisabeth sighing) - I'm glad you're back. It wasn't too unpleasant. I need your help, Elisabeth. - Oh, no, I've thrown away all of my chances. I counted on using Helga. Now I'm back on the work gang. - That's just it, I have an escape plan. Listen. (Jennie whispering) - Take her to bed with you, Jennie! You can cuddle that dirty slut all you want. She still stinks of Helga! - Shut up! Do you want to get us all into trouble, you idiot? Cunt. Now, this is my idea, this is what I think we... (birds chirping) (engines rumbling) - Hi there, Doc. - Hi. - Oh, well. - Just a minute. And the bottles? - That's the one I've already picked. And I've already paid for her. - My boys aren't gonna like that. - Well, the cellar door's open. Just go down and help yourselves. - Come on boys. (Doc chuckling) (jazz music) (Doc chuckling) - Two for one, that's better than one alone. (women giggling) (Doc chuckling) - [Elisabeth] Oh, you sexy guy. (Doc chuckling) (Elisabeth breathing heavily) (eerie music) (chair thudding) - [Soldier] Sit down, Sarge. (sergeant sighing) (soldiers chuckling) - We must move quickly. Do you think we killed him? What do you think? - We're not gonna worry about him. There they are, here are the keys. Good, come on. - Okay. - All right. - [Elisabeth] Hurry! (rooster crowing) (birds chirping) (Doc grumbling) (rooster crowing) - Sergeant! Help me! They've escaped! (Doc grumbling) - [Sergeant] What happened, who escaped? - Did she bite you this time, doctor? - What? No, no, there was another with her, they knocked me out and scrammed. They went that way, through the door I think. - Oh, shit! - You two, come with me. Come on. Quickly! (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - I can't go on, you go ahead. Get out of here, go on ahead, go on! - [Soldier] There! There's one of them! Now, you, now tell me, where is your friend? - There, there! - Where did she go? - [Soldier] You two continue, I'll take her back. Come on you little bitch. Get moving, get moving, I said! Come on! (Jennie shrieking loudly) Get going, come on! (Jennie shrieking loudly) (footsteps tapping) - So it's you, hey? You bitch! On your feet! Now where is she? Which way did she go? Did you decide to leave all of a sudden? (hand slapping) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (helicopter whirring) - [Guard] The patrol has returned, they found nothing. She must have found a hiding place. - Send out more patrols at once. I want her brought back, dead or alive! (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (Elisabeth gasping) (Jennie shrieking loudly) (whip cracking) Now, are you going to talk? - No! (Jennie shrieking loudly) (whip cracking) (footsteps tapping) (water splashing) (John grumbling) (whip cracking) (John groaning) (Hugo sighing) - [Hugo] Now it's my turn. (whip cracking) (John groaning) (Elisabeth gasping) (birds chirping) - Who are you and how did you manage to get here? - I escaped. I beg you, please take me with you. The mercenaries are at my heels. - Escaped, hey? And just by chance you found your way to our outpost. And escaped from where, may I ask? - I was imprisoned in a fortress at Stilberg. There are still many other prisoners there. A lot of women. - Henry, you come from around these parts. Have you heard at all of a fortress in this area? She's probably a spy. But shooting a pretty girl in cold blood, that I could never do. Here, put this hood on her. Come on, anyway, very soon perhaps in a few hours it won't matter anymore. Well, I'll have defeated Steiner, or be dead in a good cause. Come on fellas, let's get going. - A fine kettle of fish. Your hostage has got away. She's made fools of all of us. - It was you who was on duty. If she got away, it's your fault. - I warned you, but you wouldn't listen. All that business of Doc and the girls is going to cost us plenty. - Doc's a chatterbox but we'll shut his mouth. If you know what I mean. Take my horse, Hugo. I have a feeling that Doc's going to have an accident A fatal one. (birds chirping) (gentle music) - What's this masquerade? Do you really think that this is the right time for this sort of thing? - We found her asleep a couple of miles away from here. She claims to be on our side, but I'll say she's a spy. - All right, we'll see about that later. I've got other things to think about now. Is everything ready? - Yes chief, everybody is in position for tomorrow. First we've got a group of shock troops already in the arsenal. Then there's a second group, which will deal exclusively with the transmitter. With a good relay, you'll be able to issue a proclamation on the air as soon as we are sure that Steiner is dead. Once their president is gone the regime will collapse totally. - Now, let's have a look at your spy. - Okay. (Vogel gasping) (Elisabeth chuckling) - Papa! (Elisabeth laughing) - Well done my boy, taking my daughter for a spy. That's really something. (Elisabeth laughing) (footsteps tapping) - The two who escaped are from this dormitory. And I regard all of you as being responsible for this act. You are all confined to quarters, until I make up my mind as to the punishment you deserve. Until then, you'll get nothing to eat. - Oh, no! - Oh, no! - Silence! There's still plenty of room in the cells. (birds chirping) - It's right here. - Stilberg, no it can't can't be. There's only a castle there, unless they've changed the name. If it's the same one I know, it's in the forest. A very sinister place, build by Pierre, a French 19th century architect. - There's not a minute to lose, Peter. Get your men together, and make for that castle. We must prevent that Helga from murdering the prisoners held there. She's sure to do that as soon as she hears about the death of Steiner. - I'll go with you, I know the layout of the place. And what's more, I have a debt to pay. - No, no, no, it's too risky. That castle's going to be well defended and there are too few of us and they'll defend it like tigers. - But I want to! - Bluff your way in. Arrest everyone as if you had an army behind you. That ought to do the trick. - Hello! I've been waiting three-quarters of an hour for my call. What's going on? - [Woman] I don't know. I can't get through to the capital, all the lines are dead. There must be a breakdown somewhere. - If the president's palace doesn't answer, get me Leon Cerne. - [Woman] Leon Cerne, where? - Yes, at security. It's very important! (explosions booming) - [Man] The Liberation Force has gained control of the capital. All the key posts are in our hands. The liberation army controls all the national radio stations. (explosion booming) (flames roaring) (gunshots blasting) (people screaming) (explosions booming) (Steiner chuckling) - Oh, you've got me quite tipsy, my dear! (Steiner laughing) What is it? What do you want, tell me? Hey, tell me, this is not a regular model. - Maybe not, but it fires, read that! - What is it? What's this nonsense? - Your death mark, issued by the new republic. (gunshot blasting) (woman gasping) - [Man] And beware, the Steiner troops are surrendering by the thousands. (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music) (explosion booming) Our troops are fighting splendidly. All resistance is completely useless. - You heard, all resistance is useless. - [Man] Steiner is dead, long live the revolution! Long live Vogel, liberty forever! - We must hurry, Peter, let's go. (gunshots blasting) - Hello? Hello! Hello! (gunshots blasting) (footsteps tapping) - Jennie! Jennie! - Oh! - Oh, my God. (Elisabeth sobbing) - Oh, no. (Elisabeth sobbing) Jennie. - [Peter] Come along now, come along, there's nothing more we can do for her now, you know. - [Elisabeth] Jennie! - [Peter] Come along, Elisabeth. (somber music) (gunshots blasting) - [Helga] What do you want? You must be mad! - You bitch! You're going to die! - [Prisoner] Yes! (Helga shrieking) (dramatic music) (Helga groaning) (Helga shrieking) - [Elisabeth] John! - [Peter] Release him. (Elisabeth chuckling) Come on, let's get going. (footsteps tapping) (lively music)
