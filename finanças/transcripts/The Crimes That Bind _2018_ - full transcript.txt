Give me a break. It was the winter of 1983 when Tajima Yuriko reached Sendai, Japan. How did you intend to live after having divorced your husband? I could only think about leaving home. And did you came here? I've been here once before. I thought that it was a beautiful town. But you don't have any relatives here, right? No. I wanted to go to the town where nobody knew about me. But... I have experience of working in a bar. Please let me work here. Look at me. Yes. I hired her as an apprentice. I wanted to see how she did and decide if I'd hire her. Yasuyo, I'm telling you that she is a lucky find. She is sexually attractive and seems to have her own reasons. But she seemed to shut her mind. Whenever I asked about her family casually, Year 1985 Hey, why did you divorce your husband? Did he cheat on you? It wasn't his fault. Then, why? I failed as both a wife and a mother. Do you have a kid? How old? A boy? A girl? I have a boy. He was 10 years old when I left home. 10 years old? He must have been cute. Hey, do you have his pictures? No. Come on, you should have at least one picture of him. I said no! I don't have such a thing. But thanked her who shut her mind, I had a booming business. Year 1997 And the years went by. She never had problems with customers. Except with Watabe... Year 2001 She has an ex-husband and a son. But she hadn't got in touch with them for a long time. Miyamoto, according to the postmortem report of Tajima Yuriko, there was no cause of suspect foul play for her death. She died of heart failure. So, I tried to call Watabe immediately. Ah, are you Watabe? It's Miyamoto from Bar Seven. Please don't be panic. Yuriko died. Watabe had his reason not to be able to come to her funeral. But he contacted me a few days later. What? Her son? Does he live in Tokyo? OK. Hold on. Yes. Tokyo, Suginami-ku... Watabe told me your address since I was in trouble with finding her family. And I wrote a letter to you. I see. Yuri must be happy to see you again. That brown apartment over there, She lived there. She seemed to want to live beside a sea. She'd lived in such a tiny place frugally for 18 years. Yuri died alone on this mattress. I wish Watabe were with her at that time. Do you know Watabe's contact information? Unfortunately, he's already canceled his cell phone contract. So, I don't know where he is now. He told me that he worked at an electric power company and traveled through cities. So, whenever he came to Sendai, they spent time together. Sorry, I talked too much. Don't worry. I'm happy to hear that my mother had a company. I want to find him somehow and ask about a mother. Don't you remember anything about Watabe? Where he is from or his favorite place to go... Favorite place... Ah, Nihonbashi! Nihonbashi? Yes, Nihonbashi in Tokyo. 16 years passed without being able to get the news of her boyfriend, Watabe Shunichi Present Katsushika-ku, Tokyo Thank you for your hard work. A resident reported to the police that the liquid emitting nasty smell dripped from the upper floor. The police found a decomposed body that has been dead for 20 days. Since a body was badly damaged, the police couldn't identify its face and age. There were no belongings other than clothes. May I see? The police only could prove that it was a female and the cause of death was strangulation. Yanagi Bridge? Tokiwa Bridge... By DNA testing with a family of a victim who filed a missing person's report, A victim is identified as Oshitani Michiko, 40 years old. She lived in Hikone- city, Shiga. She worked at the cleaning company, Melody-Air located Biwa lakeside. According to her family, Oshitani Michiko went to work as usual on May 12th, Friday. Kosuga Police Station And she was absent from work without any notice since May 15th, Monday. She booked a hotel in Kaeba-cho, Tokyo on May 13th and really stayed there. In other words, she was more likely to be murdered on May 14th, Sunday. The place where Oshitani's body was found is owned by Koshikawa Mutsuo who has been living there for 9 years. But, according to the neighbors, Koshikawa has been missing since May 15th. Come in! Excuse me. It's done. Please. Thank you. This is Koshikawa Mutsuo according to his neighbors. He is more likely a suspect. The relationship between Oshitani and Koshikawa... According to her relatives. Oshitani Michiko hadn't left the area of Lake Biwa for 2 years. Then, why did she come all the way to Tokyo from Lake Biwa this time? We'll find this mystery. Then, we should be able to locate Koshikawa eventually. It's been 20 days since this incident occurred. Roll up your sleeves! Yes! What's up, Matsumiya? I think that this incident may be related to the homeless murder incident that occurred in Shinkoiwa river bed on April 16th. Ah, that incident... Why do you think so? That homeless was burned to death. But he was actually dead by strangling according to the autopsy. Both incident have the same method of murdering. It's a bit of stretch to relate these incidents only with the method of murdering. But the dates of occurrence are very close, May 14th and 16th. And both incidents occurred beside Ara River. These murder scenes are only 5 km away. The distance is the judgment based on a personal impression rather than an external fact. You're right, but... Anything else? All right, let's do the initial investigation... Matsumiya, tell us everything. As you're aware, we couldn't collect anything indicating Koshikawa's personal information from his room where was a murder scene. But I understood well one thing. What's that? He lived hand to mouth. He doesn't store any food or general merchandises. He even doesn't have a fridge. You know, he's been living there for 9 years! And I don't feel his dreams or a vision for the future either. As if he was ready to die any time. This is a residence, but not a residence. It looked like a temporary house for the homeless. Got it. We'll conduct a DNA test for that burnt body immediately. Thank you. Biwa Lake, Shiga Hikone station Why did Oshitani Michiko go to Tokyo? Did Oshitani form a friendship with Koshikawa Mutsuo? We visited Hikone where Oshitani lived to do a thorough interview with her friend, co-workers, and relatives. Melody-Air where Oshitani Michiko worked She said that she'd treat herself. Treat herself? Yes. Then, did Oshitani go to Tokyo on May 13th and 14th to treat herself? That's right. How did she treat herself? I don't know the details. She said that she'd go to Tokyo from the next day, and come back on Sunday night. So, she should have bothered us. She seemed to be happy. Right? She seemed to be happy... Did she seem to plan that trip for a long time? No. She seemed to plan that trip suddenly. Which means, she may have met somebody she knew... Or somebody contacted her. I checked her call histories, letters and e-mail. But there was no hint for her sudden trip to Tokyo. So, did she see somebody by accident and decide to go to Tokyo? Anyway, we have to check her client list one by one. It'll be hard work. We may have to split up into two groups. What are you looking at? Do you think that we can solve this incident? What? When I see this huge Biwa Lake, I'm anxious that it's like picking up one pebble from the bottom of the huge lake to solve this incident. That's how I feel. His anxiety became a reality 3 days passed, and they didn't get any valuable information from Oshitani's clients Matsumiya speaking. It's about a DNA test of that burned body. Yes. We matched DNA from that burned body to the one from Koshikawaâ€™s room. It didn't match up. I see. I thought that it was a good reasoning. The reason why Oshitani went to Tokyo should have clues to clear up this incident. Please keep investigating. Yes. Oshitani came here on Friday, May 12, Friday didn't she? Senior residence Yurakuen Yes. Was there something unusual about her? No. She was as usual. Didn't she mention you that she'd go to Tokyo? Tokyo? Sorry, please come this way. Tokyo...Tokyo... Did you remember something? Just maybe 201... 201? Yes. Ms.201. She is Jane Doe. She caused trouble with the police and broke bones. She was coy about the name and the address. The police didn't know what to do. We decided to take care of her until she recovered from an injury. She stays in Room 201. That's why we call her Ms.201. She should have recovered from ages ago. But she stays on here. So, how does Ms.201 relate to Oshitani? On that day, when Oshitani and I were walking and chatting, Ms.201 happened to pass by us. Then, Oshitani told me that Ms.201 may have been a mother of her classmate from a junior high school. I caught at the chance. I asked Oshitani to talk to Ms.201. If Ms.201 were identified, we could ask her relatives to take her home. So, when Ms.201 was having lunch here, Oshitani said... Are you Asai? You're Asai Hiromi's mother, aren't you? Ms.201 gave Oshitani a horrified look. She shouted at Oshitani. "I'm not Asai! You get the wrong person!" She threw her lunch to her. My clothes also got filthy and... Well, how does that incident relate to Oshitani going to Tokyo? Mr.201's daughter, Asai Hiromi seems to be a famous stage director. Since Oshitani is a theatergoer, she can proud to be a friend of Asai Hiromi. And she's been thinking of going to see Asai Hiromi one day. But she'd been patient since she thought that if Asai didn't remember her, she'd trouble her. She got an excellent excuse to visit Asai Hiromi. Ms.201? Are you there? What do you want?! A detective from Tokyo wants to talk to you. What? Excuse me. Don't come in! Are you Asai? No! I said NO so many times! Did you say No to this person? I can't remember. Oshitani was strangled to death the other day. So what? She was more likely to go to Tokyo to find something out about you. Your daughter lives in Tokyo, right? I don't know! Don't you know? You don't deny that you have a daughter... In other words, you accept that you have a daughter, right? Shut up! I don't know anything! Get lost! Get lost! Moron! Get lost! Asai Atsuko, 65. She is in a senior residence, Yurakuen in Hikone city. Her only daughter, Asai Hiromi, 40. She is from Hikone city, a stage director, and a former actor. She is producing theatrical plays at Meijiza right now. Why do you call me so much? I'm sorry. But detectives ask to meet you. Detectives? They say that they go there to meet you if you're too busy. Please tell them that I'll be there. Got it. Sorry to get straight to the point, but do you know this lady? She is Oshitani Michiko who is my classmate from junior high school. How come you recognize her so immediately? Because I saw her recently. When did you see her? It was on the evening of May 13th. You can answer without hesitating, can't you? Usually... I expected you to ask me that. I heard that Oshitani died. Did you know that? Yes, I saw that news in the paper. I couldn't believe that. Could you tell us more details? It was a day before the first day of the play. She visited me when I was keeping running around. May 13th A day before the first day of the play You look great! It's been 26 years since we saw each other, right? You look very young. You too, Micchan. What's the matter? As a matter of fact, your mother may be in a senior residence in Shiga. I'm sure that she is your mother. Can you go and take her with you? People in senior residence are having a difficult time. I'm sorry but I must decline your request. Why did you say that? I don't have a mother. That woman abandoned my father and me. Hey, Asai! 26 years ago Can you come outside and explain to us what's going on? If you don't pay back the debt, you're no better than a thief! Say something! That woman took all the money and gave her boyfriend financial aid. And once all money was gone, she borrowed a large amount of money under father's name. Asai Hiromi, 14 That woman messed up the life of my father and me. My father worried about that debt and committed suicide. Thank you very much. Did Oshitani tell you something about her schedule in Tokyo? She said that she'd go back to Hikone on the same day. But when she was leaving... Hiromi, do you still have a ticket for tomorrow? Sorry, it's sold out since tomorrow is the first day of the play. Yes, of course. I'm going back then. Take care. I see. Then, this is the last question. Does this man look familiar to you? I see. Thank you for your cooperation. You're welcome. People lie. To protect themselves, or to protect somebody... The lie is a shadow of the truth. Everybody lives with carrying an emotional scar. To protect that scar, people put a lid on their mind. The Crime That Bind Anyway, Kyo, you've been working at Nihonbashi Police Station for a long time. Aren't you getting tired? Who the hell do you think you are? I'm very busy right now. I hope we can get seats. What? "Sunaba" noodle restaurant? Why not? Itâ€™s very expensive... Welcome! Hello. misaki, I go for 3 layers with a lot of wasabi. OK. By the way, it's your treat. What? How many layers? I go for a single layer. A single. Certainly. So, what do you want to ask me? About that! That play? I hear that that has a good reputation. I didn't know that you're interested in the play. What? Original piece, Chikamatsu Monzaemon Director, Asai Hiromi Did you find the name of an acquaintance? Director is Asai Hiromi. Do you know her? When I went to interview her, I saw your picture in her office. You were in the training hall with her and a bunch of kids. There was a Kendo class hold by Nihonbashi Police Station. I taught Kendo to aspiring actors whom she took to. I haven't seen her in years. What do you think about her? She was beautiful. That's not what I mean. Do you think that she possibly drifts into crime? What? Is she suspected? Well, she was suspected... By the state of the corpse, the day of the crime is most likely from the afternoon of 14th to the morning of 15th. And we took evidence from people involved in the play. Asai Hiromi didn't go out of Meijiza from May 13th to 15th since having stayed and worked. It's impossible for her to murder her. I see. But I'm still curious about Asai Hiromi and her mother. They seem to be hurt mentally... She said for no particular reason once before... I had an abortion once. I don't have motherhood. I think that the motherhood is inherited from a mother to a child. But I didn't have that opportunity. I'm a murderer. People usually try to hide their emotional scar. But she told me whom she met only a few times that. Everybody has an emotional scar. That's why people aren't obvious at first glance. I see. Koshikawa and a burned body of a homeless... Why did you think that that burned body was Koshikawa? By my intuition. Both crime scenes are very close, and both were strangled to death. Koshikawa's room looked like a temporary house for the homeless. But their DNA didn't match up. I was embarrassed. I shouldn't have relied on my intuition. Why not? The detective always relies on the intuition. What did you use for a DNA test? Well... Toothbrush, razor or used towel? Wow, bingo! Haven't you thought the possibility that a suspect replaced those typical materials that the police usually use for a DNA test? Just to tell you, I'd think that. Bingo! So... We were completely taken for a sucker! DNA on the sheet is matched up with DNA of a burned body. Now, These two incidents are connected! Good job, Matsumiya! Tell all detectives to come back. We'll have a meeting in an hour! Yes! Hurry up! Time waits for no one! Matsu, what's wrong? Call other detectives! Time is money, Tokiwa Bridge, isn't it? Game of rhyming, "TOKI WA kanenari" and "TOKIWA Bridge" What? Just laugh. What the hell is that? He got that joke from memos on that calendar. Ah, those memos... What are these bridge names for? These are bridges around Nihonbashi. This month... Tokiwa Bridge for June... One ticket per person for today's ticket. Tickets are old out for today One ticket per person for today's ticket. I'm sorry. Tickets are sold out for today. I'm sorry. Kaga! Ah, nice to see you again! I made my debut as an actress in here, Meijiza. It's my holy sanctuary. And you make your debut as a director in here today. You're amazing. Thank you. Kaga, do you still work at Nihonbashi Police Station? Yes, I'm unsuccessful at my age. I always goof around this neighborhood. I see. Is something wrong? Nothing. Please enjoy the play. Ah, thank you for a ticket. You're welcome. She is very beautiful after all. Tokiwa Bridge Ikkoku Bridge for April, Yanagi Bridge for May, Tokiwa Bridge for June. No way... Kyo! Hey! What are you doing here? I'm working! Kyo, you too? My purpose is that. You mean that boat? I can do anything I want on my day off, right? That being said... Do you want some? Ah, Ningyo-yaki from Shigemori? Ningyo-yaki=small cake baked in small an iron mold and is filled with sweet bean paste Thank you. Hey, Kyo! Are you investigating that incident? Yes. Ah, that DNA, it was just as you thought. I knew it! It's the intuition of an experienced detective. Thanks to your intuition, our investigation moved forward. Thank you. The opinion of a detective of the jurisdiction is sometimes useful, right? I feel like to steal the credit from you. I don't feel good. Forget about that. You're an adult. I have to go. Hey, are you leaving now? Time is money, Tokiwa Bridge, isn't it? Wow, you sound like an old man! Wait! I didn't make this joke. Head Obayashi said so. Did he? The names of various bridges were written in the calendar of Koshikawa's thing left behind, something like Tokiwa Bridge, Nihon Bridge, Asakusa Bridge and Saemon Bridge. What's wrong? Ouch! What's wrong? Give me more details. What? About that calendar! Calm down. Hurry up! Calm down. I can't see my memo. What's wrong with you? Hurry up! So, Asakusa Bridge for January, Saemon Bridge for February, For March... Nishikashi Bridge, right? Ikkoku Bridge for April, Yanagi Bridge for May, Tokiwa Bridge for June, Nihon Bridge for July, Edo Bridge, Yoroi Bridge, Kayaba Bridge and Minato Bridge... And Toyomi Bridge? How did you know that? So, are you going to take all of them with you? Yes. Since these are mementos of my mother and Watabe. Sendai, 16 years ago Thank you. If Watabe contacts you, please tell him that I keep his belongings carefully. And, I'll tell him that you want to know how your mother lived, right? Please. What? She wrote down something. These are bridges around Nihonbashi area. She told me that she used those spot for a rendezvous point. So, the calendar of Aunt Yuriko's memento is... same as Koshikawa's?! Kyo! Do me a favor? A favor of my lifetime. Can you conduct a handwriting analysis of those 2 calendars? As you can see, the names of bridges written in these calendars are matched up perfectly. 16 years ago Memento of Tajima Yuriko Inspector Kaga's birth mother Present Memento of Koshikawa the owner of the unit where Oshitani Michiko was killed And both handwriting is matched up too according to Crime Lab. Kaga, can you explain this to us? Yes. This calendar was left in the room of my mother who died 16 years ago. But its handwriting didn't match up with my mother. It was most likely written by Watabe Shunichi who lived with my mother at that time. Miyamoto who took care of my mother told me so. In other words, that Watabe Shunichi is likely to be Koshikawa Mutsuo. Right? Yes. The calendar that was found 16 years ago appeared again many years later... We asked the cooperation with Nihonbashi police station for investigating this incident. Inspector Kaga joins us from today. As of now, that Miyamoto knows about Watabe most. Does she still alive? Yes. She is cheerful every day in Sendai. Miyamoto! Ah, Kaga! Nice to see you. I see. You're Kaga's cousin. Then, you know Yuri too. No. She's already left home when I was born. I see. Miyamoto, the reason why we're here is... If I remember the face of Watabe, right? I think I can remember. I wish I had his picture. He didn't like to take his picture. So, we brought composite sketches. There're 5 sketches. Can you tell me if you think that it's Watabe? Well... Ah, this is Watabe. Not only the characteristics of him, but also its appearance. When he gets older, he'll be like this man. This is Watabe. Watabe changed the name from Watabe Shunichi to Koshikawa Mutsuo. And he was strangled to death and was discovered in a burned body. Watabe Shunichi Koshikawa Mutsuo Lovers I wonder if uncle Takamasa knows that Aunt Yuriko had a lover in Sendai after having left home. Inspector Kaga's birth mother Tajima Yuriko Inspector Kaga's birth father Kaga Takamasa Former couple I don't know. This is it. I see. She lived in such a town. My mother seemed to want to live beside a sea. Her apartment was around that new bridge. Apartment... But this area suffered great damage from the Great East Japan Earthquake... Yes. It swallowed everything. Why did Aunt Yuriko leave you? Both uncle and you didn't tell me anything. I want to know that too. All I can remember is that a mother suddenly disappeared in the summer day. When I came back from Kendo training, there was a memo on the table. Please don't search for me. I'm sorry, Kyo. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! At that time, I held a grudge against a father. I did from the depth of my heart. I blame nobody but my father who didn't think about family. It's been 18 years since then. My mother died quietly in this town. Mother married a loser like you. But you didn't make her happy! Why don't you excuse yourself to her at least? It's I that am to blame. My father told me about a mother for the first time then. My mother didn't get on well with relatives on the father's side. She got a rough deal from them since she used to work at a nightclub. My father was very busy and out most of the time. Raising of a kid and bullied by relatives... She took it all on herself. She couldn't stand any more mentally. When I was an elementary school kid, I'm sorry. What's wrong with me... That's... Did she have depression? Do you hold a grudge against a mother? Or do you sympathize with her? I couldn't care less such a thing! She died alone. Nobody was by her bedside. She should have wanted to see you. How do you know that?! I know. Don't be by my bedside when I'm going to die. I'm going to die alone. That was why you didn't come to the hospital when uncle died. I wasn't aware of that fact. But if this incident is solved, we may be able to know something about your mother. That's what I think. Aunt's lover, Watabe's body was found though he was dead. Yes. By any chance, you transferred from Crime Square 1 to Nihonbashi police station to look for Watabe? Have you been looking for that man to ask about a mother? Is that why you've been staying at Nihonbashi police station? I'm a super mommy's boy at my age The estimated age is 70 years old. There's no picture of him even though he lived 70 years. Is such a thing possible? He used 2 different names too. I think that he used more names. Watabe was escaping from something. I totally believe so. Watabe Shunichi Koshikawa Mutsuo Until finding out his true ID, we can't solve this incident. The only clue at the moment is... bridge names on the calendar. Yes. I've been investigating this for 16 years. But I got no clue. Have you been to all bridges? Tokiwa Bridge is the only one that I visited consciously. I've had a chance to just pass the rest. Shall we go? It'll be fun to look up from the bottom. Wow! Toyomi Bridge for December. Wow, it's amazing! I've never been under the bridge. But what kind of relation does a month have to bridges? Is it the construction month? I've already checked that. But it didn't match at all. I see. So, that is Minato Bridge for November. OK. From here, a boat goes under the Metropolitan Expressway. That's Kayaba Bridge for October. I always pass here. It's Yoroi Bridge for September. I see. This is Edo Bridge for August. OK. And that's Nihon Bridge for July. Do you pop into your head? Well, talking about July, do they have the Star Festival? No. But there's 'Hashi Arai". Hashi Arai=a lot of volunteers wash Nihon Bridge annually Hashi Arai? A lot of people wash Nihon Bridge in July every year. It's a historical event that has been for 47 years. You know very well. I've been here for 16 years. Osamu, please stop a boat. OK. I see. They wash this bridge. About 2,000 people gather here. 2,000 people?! Yes. Do 2,000 people wash that bridge? Yes. Look! This is a picture from last year. I see. You and a man beside you... A lot of people are talking on a cell phone. When we want to meet somebody on the bridge, since there were more than 2,000 people, I don't know where he is. I was to meet my wife on the bridge on this day. But I had no idea where she was. Watabe was escaping from something. She told me that she used those spot for a rendezvous point. What are these boxes? These are pictures of Hashi Arai. I called photographers to collect as many as pictures of Hashi Arai. Don't tell me you're going to examine these pictures one by one! You don't even know his face, do you? Start with looking for a man similar to this sketch. When we pick up a few men, we show those pictures to people who know Watabe. We're not sure if Watabe went to see Hashi Arai. It was advantageous for people who want to meet somebody secretly since it was so crowded. Watabe met somebody annually in July in Hashi Arai. We found an interesting fact from a memento of Kaga's mother. What about it? Many fingerprints were left on the specific page of the timetable. Senseki Line and Ishinomaki Line... There are so many fingerprints on this page. Especially, this Onagawa Station, Onagawa? According to Inspector Kaga, Miyamoto in Sendai told Kaga that Watabe worked at an electric power company. From Sendai to Onagawa, it took an hour and a half to make a round trip at that time. Watabe worked at Onagawa nuclear plant, and go to Sendai to spend time with Kaga's mother on his day off. Both Watabe and Koshikawa were not on the list of the radiation workers. He probably used the different name there. Special Investigation Unit, getting info from former employees. There should be people who know him. Yes! Checked Onagawa Nuclear Plant Have you seen this man? About 16 years ago, around here... Have you seen this man? You should have worked with him at Onagawa Nuclear Plant 16 years ago. Nozawa Sadakichi, 71. He is an old identity among survivors. He knew a lot of people. We should be able to get info about Watabe from him. Excuse me. Yes. We're from MPD. May I see Nozawa Sadakichi? Nozawa? Does he remain unconscious? Yes, unfortunately... He is in critical condition of heart failure. Please have some. Thank you. May I? Yummy. About Asai Hiromi of junior high school time, How was your impression of her? She was hard to talk. Only Micchan was friendly to her. Micchan? Oshitani. She was bullied for some time. Oh please! You lead the way in bullying her! You were jealous of her since she was very cute. Was I? Yes. What was a trigger for the bullying? Well, her mother left home, and Yakuza started hanging out at her father's shop. And we were...Right? I see. By the way, do you know a man in his 40s who is a mutual acquaintance of Asai and Oshitani at that time? The 40s? How about teacher Naemura? Ah, he was in his 40s at that time. Partly, because of the bullying, teacher Naemura cared about Asai. He let us write a message to her when she changed schools. That's right. Can you contact that teacher Naemura? I want to talk to him. Well... He disappeared without a trace. Disappeared? Nobody knows where he went. Do you have a picture of him? How about a yearbook? Yes, I have. Wait a minute. Thank you. Do you remember anything when Asai Hiromi changed schools? Well...Anything? I don't remember much. She disappeared without our noticing. Didn't we ask teacher Naemura what happened to her? She disappeared without your noticing... Yes. When I think back, she must have had a hard time since her father died at that time. Right, he killed himself by jumping off a tower building. Yes. I felt bad when I heard that from teacher Naemura. This is a yearbook. He is teacher Naemura. And this picture is us 6 years later. Is this teacher Naemura? Yes. He looks like a different man, doesn't he? Can you check this? OK. Does this man seem familiar to you? Well... By any chance, is he teacher Naemura? Really? I don't think so. The feature may change in 25 years. This sketch somehow looks similar to teacher Naemura like this groomy face. Asai's father jumped from this building. He must have got deeper and deeper into debt. There were no tall buildings around here at that time. All he could do was to jump from this building. What happened to Asai Hiromi here? What happened to her? How was that? Did you tell her what our business was? I see. Tell her that I'll be there in 10 minutes. Did he disappear without a trace? Yes. Naemura's ex-wife Imai Kayoko He had an affair with a woman and left home. An affair? Who was a woman? No matter how many times I asked, all he said was "I'm sorry, but please divorce me". Such a thing lasted a year. When I was about ready to give up... What happened? I saw a ruby pendant of 500,000 yen on the account statement. When I called the store to confirm his purchase, it was a cross pendant that I liked. I totally thought that it was a gift for me since I'm a Christian. But when I questioned him relentlessly... I'm sorry. I have trouble contacting her. She is probably in her private room upstairs. Please wait a few moments. No problem. Take time. I want a picture of that pendant that she wore at that time. I can't remember that. Make a good excuse to take a picture of that. Kyo, do you believe that the truth becomes clear depending on that picture? I do. What are you doing? Don't scare me! Aren't you in your private room? I was in a back room. So, what are you doing? I can barely see Kyo, Kaga smiling like this. So, I want to take a picture. Do you know about Kaga? I mean that we have an inseparable relationship. He is in Shiga right now. He is investigating about Oshitani incident. I came here to ask you a few things about Oshitani. Picture sent I'm sorry but it requires haste. Ah, it's ruby! It's my birthstone. Asai Hiromi, 20 I'm happy. Thank you! Well, I'm thinking about quitting work. Why? If I come to Tokyo, we can live together. How about your wife? I'm going to ask her to divorce me. I can no longer continue a married life with her. Hiromi, did you have an abortion? Why did you do such a thing without asking me?! I finally got cast. Thereâ€™s no time to raise a child! I showed Naemuraâ€™s picture to a staff at Blue Star Jewelry, she said that this pendant was certainly a product of their shop. This man is a lover of Asai Hiromi, Naemura Seizo. Koshikawa Mutsuo Watabe Shunichi Naemura Seizo Asai probably got blackmailed from Oshitani about her affair. Asai asked Naemura's advice, and had Naemura kill Oshitani. Even though Asai Hiromi had an alibi, if we think so, it accounts for it. But they fought among themselves after that. Asai strangled him to death and burned his body to destroy evidence. I see. Matsumiya, go to Sendai and get enough evidence! Yes. Have you seen this man? No... Please look carefully. Miyamoto, if you met him, it'd be 5 to 6 years later of this picture. I don't know him... Well, Isn't this man Watabe Shunichi? What? No. It's completely different. He is a completely different person. A different person? I see. Thank you. Is something wrong? Ah, itâ€™s about an incident... Ah, yes, thank you for this. What? It's pictures of Hashi Arai that I borrowed from you. Ah, you're welcome. Was this useful? Yes, it was very useful. But how did you know that my brother is a photographer? Since I'm a detective, I can check almost anything. What? You didn't check my personal things, did you? Did you?! Of course not. I don't mind, anyway. What kind of incident? What? Kaga, you're somehow different than usual. You're tack sharp. When I investigate this incident, my heart is confused, since my mother is involved in this incident. Your mother? My father probably would tell me not to mix up personal matters and official ones. Anyway, it doesn't matter since he isn't interested in me at all. Do you still think of him like that? My father whom you know is a good one just before he died. A father whom I know is a totally different person. Good night. We're back where we started. I thought that it wasn't bad at all. It can't be helped. The investigation is a series of waiting in vain. But... It doesn't smell right that Asai Hiromi strangled Naemura to death and burned his body... This incident is difficult for a woman. But if Asai put him to sleep by drugs, it's possible. But she bothered to burn his body after that. She didn't have to strangle him to death. She could put him to sleep and burned his body. You're right. And, I felt like that Naemura wasn't Watabe from the beginning. What? Or more like it's my wish. I didn't want my mother to fall in love with a man who had an affair with his student and gave up everything to disappear. I'm a super mommy's boy after all. You haven't understood your father's true feelings yet. You're an idiot son! What? Even though having known that he was going to die soon, he didn't get upset. He seemed to rather look forward to that time. I have to say goodbye to you soon. Don't say that. Aren't you afraid? You mean to go to the heaven? No. I can't wait. I can look at him as much as I want from the heaven. My body nothing but interferes with me. Don't tell him, OK? Yes. Good night. I didn't know that he said such a thing. What's up with this incident?! This incident reminds me, my mother and father. Why did I look for Watabe in this town for 16 years? Yes, because I wanted to know desperately if my mother's life was happy after she left home. I wanted to know if my mother wanted to see me in her last moment. That's all I wanted to know. But Watabe who knew all was burned to death. Who is this dead man of a sketch? Who killed him? Asai Hiromi? Yes. She is definitely involved in this incident. It's the intuition of a detective. But what's her motivation? I seem to see clues, but I don't. I should overlook something important. Did I interview people involved in this incident thoroughly? Did I investigate enough around Oshitani Michiko? Relatives, friends, and co-workers... Yes, I did whatever I could thoroughly. How about Asai Hiromi? Her father jumped to death. Her mother is in a senior residence. Her parties concerned had alibis. How about Naemura's ex-wife? She has a motive but had an alibi. How about Watabe Shunichi? Watabe's lover who is my mother has already died. And my father who may have held a grudge against them has already died too. Who else? Whom haven't I interviewed? Myself? This incident has too much relation to my past. Fate? No, rather it's an incident involved in my life. By any chance, is a key to solving this incident me? Assuming so, let's reason. Asai Hiromi Oshitani Michiko Watabe Shunichi These 3 people are connected. Oshitani Michiko who was Asai Hiromi's classmate was killed in the room of Watabe who was my mother's lover. Yuriko who was Watabe's lover had a son who is I. And these 2 people are connected too. Asai Hiromi whom I met by accident at Kendo class is connected with Watabe through Oshitani. Is it purely a coincidence? Wait. Did Asai really want me who was a former All-Japan Kendo champion to teach amateur kids Kendo? There must have been a lot of teachers elsewhere. If so... Wait a second... Did she come to see me? Why did she want to see me? Why did she confess such a thing to me, a stranger? I'm a murderer. Why...Why did she come to see me? If the shoe were on the other foot... If I go to see Asai Hiromi purposely... What's the reason? Asai Tadao Jumped to death Died in 1991 It's my holy sanctuary. I can look at him as much as I want from the heaven. My body nothing but interferes with me. If such a thing existed, would you like to see that? Yes, I definitely would go to see that. Shiga Police Headquarters Noto, Ishikawa I'm sorry to visit you without an appointment. I don't have much time, so please keep it short. Yes. It'll take 10 minutes. Wow. It's amazing. I don't like a white wall. That remains me an orphanage that I was put into. Kanamori? Yes. Are you also a detective? She works in a different department. A man shouldn't visit the lady's house alone. I see. So? This is a picture of Hashi Arai 8 years ago. Do you go there every year? No. Did you go with somebody at this time? I was alone. I happened to be passing by there. You seem to talk to this person with a cell phone. This is a magazine that I was interviewed. Does this look familiar to you? Yes. I received word of my mother's death by letter 16 years ago. The address was the apartment where I lived alone at that time. I wondered how a sender knew that address that even my mother shouldn't have known. I asked that to a sender. She said that she was told by a man named Watabe. I asked the publishing company of this magazine. And they said that somebody asked my address 16 years ago. But it wasn't Watabe. She was a beautiful lady and I was proud of meeting her since I like to see plays. So, I remember her very well. She was Director Asai Hiromi. She said that she would want to interview the top Kendo player since her next play was about a sword fight. You visited me with child actors 5 years ago. You'd already checked my address 11 years before to let Watabe know that. Am I wrong? You're wrong. I don't know Watabe. My purpose was to interview you. Interview me? I wasn't interviewed by you. That's right. As I recall, a subject of the play changed and the interview was canceled 16 years ago. Then, why me? Because... I saw this magazine in a bookstore accidentally. This magazine was published 3 years before you asked my address. Ah, excuse me. May I use a washroom? Please. Thank you. Sorry. I met your classmate the other day in Shiga. I wondered when I talked to them. They didn't remember much about when you changed schools. I bet. I moved to an orphanage soon after my father died without saying goodbye to friends. But they remembered that your father jumped to death very well. He even took me to that building. But that was just a rumor. There's no record that somebody ever jumped off that building. And yet everybody believes that. I don't know. But it's a fact that my father jumped to death. Where? To be honest, I don't remember. I was terribly upset at that time. And I was taken to an orphanage before anyone knew what was happening. I ask you frankly. Your father died differently and in another place, didn't he? Your classmates didn't notice you change schools until their teacher told them. Because you didn't usually go to school. You did a flit. Teacher Naemura kept silence even though he knew that you did a flit. He probably tried not to give you a bad impression of a flit. That was why Naemura lied to them that your father jumped to death from that building, even though he knew where and how your father really died. He did that for you. Knowing you, I'm sure that you've already known where my father committed suicide, right? But if your reasoning is right, am I accused of a crime? Fraud in an application for employment? You won't be accused of a crime at all in this case. If so, what's the matter? In his last moment, he said, "I can't wait to look at my kid from the heaven. I don't mind to lose my body for that" Parents may be able to become non-existent for their kid. Don't you think so? I must ask you to leave now. Take it. Sorry to ask you a strange thing. That's fine. I can see the real facts of this incident by your words. Thank you. Ah, I didn't do anything. You should thank your father. He probably is watching you. What's up? Nozawa made a recovery. Really? So, did you show him a sketch? Well, he said that that man wasn't either Watabe or Koshikawa. That man is Yokoyama Kazutoshi. Yokoyama Kazutoshi? Kazutoshi... That name must be on the list of the radiation workers. Get his domicile by birth and his picture immediately! But... Write down Yokoyama Kazutoshi and Watabe Shunichi and compare them. When writing Yokoyama Kazutoshi and Watabe Shunichi using Chinese characters... Yokoyama made a fake name, Watabe Shunichi by reversing characters of a first-name. And about Watabe, there was a plumbing company, Watabe Plumbing in Onagawa town before the earthquake. Yokoyama used to work there. Watabe Shunichi comes from that... According to the list of the radiation workers, Yokoyama's address at that time was Atsuta-ku, Nagoya. He married twice and divorced twice. I asked Aichi Prefectural Police to send his picture to us. I'll get it soon. OK. Staying on her tail. What? OK. I'll instruct later. It's from the search group. Asai Hiromi seemed to take the Tokaido bullet train from Tokyo station. The Tokaido bullet train?! Yes. And one more thing. Kaga visited Asai Hiromi this morning. Kaga took a lady with him. Kaga? Matsu, did he tell you something? No. Call him now! Kaga! I'll explain everything. But before that, I have a proposition. I want to do a DNA test of parent-child relation. What do you mean? Asai Hiromi came to see me 5 years ago. That was no coincidence. I searched the man of that sketch, Watabe for 16 years. Because I wanted to have a glimpse of my mother's boyfriend. But that Watabe had already died. If I knew that Watabe had a child, I'd definitely go to see her. Asai Hiromi thought the same thing. You mean... Is Watabe a father of Asai Hiromi, Asai Tadao? Yes. Then, everything makes sense. Hey! Don't be stupid! A father of Asai Hiromi jumped to death 26 years ago! From a building in Shiga! Are you sure? Shiga Police Headquarters Yes, there's no record that Asai Tadao jumped to death from Nagahama Tower Building. But at the same time, Asai jumped to death at Noto, Ishikawa. There's a postmortem certificate of Asai Tadao in Noto Police Station. Of course, I have a copy of that. Please wait. I'll bring that to you. See? Even though at the different place, Asai Tadao died 26 years ago! It's a fake story that Asai Hiromi made. Including Watabe and Oshitani's murder incidents, the secret of this incident dates back to 26 years ago. Can you explain that in a way that we'll understand? What happened 26 years ago? I try to guess as much as I can. But it's only Asai Hiromi who knows the truth of her father and herself. Hey you! Don't open the door without asking me! Hey, say something! Don't enter without my permission! You seem to remember the face of a child whom you abandoned. I forgive anybody but you! I'll hold a grudge against you until I die. It was better if you only left us. But you fell deeper into debt for your useless boyfriend by using father's registered seal. Since you're a nymphomaniac, a father was... Go to hell! Go to hell that is further severe than a father experienced. Pay your debts now! Pay us what you owe! Do you understand? Say something! Pay your debts now! You, scum! No! Don't touch me! Leave me alone! I found his daughter. It can't be helped. If you don't have money, she can help you, right? Dad! Take her! Dad! Hiromi! No! Come! Please don't! My daughter has nothing to do with debts! The family should help each other, right? Stop it! Here! Hurry up! Policemen, come here! I'll pay debts tomorrow by all means. Please leave now. Letâ€™s go. Enryaku Temple Hieizan Welcome. Thank you. I'm fine. Go ahead. Dad. What? What do we do from now on? A long time ago, the Buddhist priests of Enryaku Temple set fire to the main hall to commit suicide, to counter the influence of Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshinori. How can they do such a thing? If I had to die, I'd choose other methods. I shudder just thinking about being burned to death. Hiromi. I'll protect you at any cost. So, don't be frightened. Dad, it's dangerous. Let's go! Dad? Hey, Dad! Hiromi, aren't you hungry? Let's treat ourselves tonight. Let's go! Family trip? Something like that. I envy you. Sure, there's no fun to come in such a place alone. Are you alone? Yes. I swung by here on the way to the next task. Have some. I'm fine. Come on! Hey. Cheers. What do you do? I'm a glow boy. A glow boy? I work at the nuclear plant. I was in Wakasa doing a regular check at Mihama Nuclear Plant. And I am on the way to Fukushima. I'm a migrant worker who works in nuclear plants across Japan. I see. When are you going back home? I have neither a family nor a home. I'm not sure what happened to my residence certificate in Nagoya. Can you get a job even though you don't have a proper residence certificate? Yes. If you have this. Certified Radiation Safety Manager Yokoyama Kazutoshi Yokoyama Kazutoshi. Yes. Can anybody get this? If you have a residence certificate. Can you hook me up with that job? I'm looking for a job. Please! No way. If I take you with me, I may be fired, right? It's 1,410 yen. How old are you? I'm 14. Really? You're grown-up for your age. Do you want extra money? There's a blue van in the parking. Please come to see me later. I'll give me money. This hotel looks very expensive. I don't mind to stay at the station or a park. Don't worry about money. It's OK now. How come? You don't have to know that. OK, let's have a bath in a long time! Hiromi, take time and enjoy it. Wait! Are you really going to take a bath? Of course, I am. Hey. I knew that you came to see me. You ran away to escape debt collectors, didn't you? People who have issues have a specific aura. How much do you give me? A lot! Come here. Hey, come here. Hey! Come here. Come here. Hey! Come inside. Come here. Hiromi! Dad! Hiromi, where have you been? Dad! I...Chopsticks... What? Chopsticks... Chopsticks? Hiromi, what happened? Hiromi! Dad. Dad. Sorry for having kept you waiting. How was he? Listen. Listen to me carefully. Take this bag and go back to the hotel now. And take off this handkerchief. Yokoyama's fingerprints are on this handkerchief. And tell a hotel employee tomorrow morning, "My father is missing" What do you do? I'm going to take his van and go to Fukushima. Fukushima? The most important thing is... I put my clothes on him and pushed him off a cliff. When his body is found, it creates a huge fuss. Hiromi, you'll be asked to go to the police station to identify a dead body. You should say this. "Yes. This is my father" You mean... I'll pretend that I committed suicide. To be honest, I intended to jump to death from that cliff tonight. But, Hiromi, you have saved my life. You're going to an orphanage. But it's much better than running away, right? Dad, how about you? Are you going to live as another person? That's right. I'm Yokoyama Kazutoshi from now on. Can't we meet anymore? No! Hiromi. Your happiness is my only wish. I don't care about other things. If you can live under the roof, go to school, find something you like and find your calling... Try to live your life with dreams! You're in love with someone one day and have a happy life. I promise that I'll write a letter to you. I Can't use my name. So, I use the name, Kondo Kyoko. Hiromi, you're a big fan of Kondo Masahiko and Koizumi Kyoko, right? Kondo Masahiko and Koizumi Kyoko=Both were popstars at that time So, I use Kondo Kyoko. Dad, sorry. It's my entire fault. Please promise me to have a happy life. Go! You'd better hurry up. Goodbye, Hiromi. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Her mother went insane. She is slobbering and talking to herself. But there's no sign that Asai Hiromi caused her harm. She must have been told extraordinary things by Asai Hiromi. But I don't' understand. Why did Asai Hiromi choose to be famous? Should she live quietly? Whether she likes it or not, she became the focus of attention, right? She may have wanted to live a different life at least in the play. Congratulations, Hiromi. You're amazing. Your debut is Meijiza of such a big theater. I'm proud of you as a friend. Hiromi, you can be a wonderful actress! So, way to go! I want to go to watch your act at Meijiza one day. By the way, I'm going to Tokyo soon. Please let me know when you get offs. I'd love to see you if you can. Kondo Kyoko. To, Asai Hiromi From, Kondo Kyoko I'm stunned. You're beautiful. Dad? Please don't cry. So, are you going to retire from the acting and focus on directing? Yes. I came to think that I wanted to produce the work that impresses the audience. I see. I see. It's wonderful. But I'm not sure whether I have talent. Try it. You can do it. Don't worry. I'm looking forward to watching your play at Meijiza one day. Now, I have one more fun thing to look forward to. When I die, I want to haunt Meijiza. Then, I can watch your play as much as I want. It's a bad joke. Asai Tadao must have had mixed feelings. If his existence became known to the public, his daughter would be ruined. He was Pandora's Box so to speak. Tajima Yuriko. She looks like a nice lady. Aren't you going to marry her? I don't want to make a big scene. How about you, Hiromi? Do you have a boyfriend? No. Really? You'll be all right. You'll have a happy life. Are you a father of Asai Hiromi? Can you explain what is going on? Teacher Naemura? Hiromi. Dad? Can you rent a car? I have to carry bulky luggage now. I can, but... And we shouldn't meet at a hotel anymore. We have to think of alternative ways. And they came up the way of meeting on these 12 bridges. Especially, Nihon Bridge in July, That Hashi Arai was an excellent time to meet since there were so many people there. Even other months, if they talk on the cell phone over the river, they didn't seem like talking to each other from the outside. I see. But why did they choose around Nihon Bridge? There's Meijiza of their holy sanctuary in that area. Asai Hiromi dreamed of coming back to Meijiza as a director. May 14, the first day of the play And her dream finally came true. Asai Tadao who refrained from going to watch her play showed up at Meijiza that time. But there was one more special person at Meijiza on that day. It was Oshitani Michiko. Day tickets were offered shortly before the play on that day. Asai Tadao may have been the reason why Oshitani Michiko decided to stay overnight in Tokyo. Because a dead man was in front of her. She tried to talk to him in order to find the truth after the play was over. This is a video of the security camera at Meijiza. We can see Asai Tadao who turned in surprise when Oshitani tried to talk to him. There was no way he could send her off since she knew that he was still alive. Tadao invited Oshitani to his apartment and killed her. All right. As soon as we get the result of DNA test, we'll ask Asai Hiromi to come voluntarily to a police station for questioning. Wait a second. Kyo, I understood how Oshitani Michiko was murdered. But how about Asai Tadao? Who strangled him to death before having burned him? It was Asai Hiromi. I can't think about anything other than that. But if your reasoning is right... Since having had a very severe experience together, they must have had a strong bond. That was exactly why. The last day of the play This is the room that only directors can enter. Wow, I'm honored. Please. Did you get the result of a DNA test? Yes. 99.9%, that burned body and you are a father and a daughter. How did you figure that out? If you didn't come to see me 5 years ago, I wouldn't figure that out. It was very likely that this incident remained unsolved. But I don't regret it. When having met you for the first time, I strangely became convinced that, a lady whom my father fell in love was a wonderful lady. I was relieved. I thought that my father's life wasn't a tragedy. Why did I kill my father? That's what you want to know, right? Yes. I'm going on the road. May 16 The third day of the play I won't be able to see you for a while. I see. Can you pick up a paperback that I'm going to leave behind a pillar? OK. I'll leave money here. Don't worry. I don't need money today. Hiromi, can I come closer to you? No problem. Congratulations, Hiromi. Your play at Meijiza was excellent. Thank you. Keep going, Hiromi. Please exert yourself to the utmost so that you will have no regrets. And be happy. Thank you. At that time... Dad! I had a bad feeling since I saw father's expression that I only saw once in my life again. To, Hiromi To, Kaga Kyoichiro So, I followed him. Hiromi. What the hell are you doing? Why did you follow me? If somebody sees you... Please explain what's going on. My father told me everything. He killed Oshitani in his apartment. And he killed teacher Naemura 19 years ago. No way... Sorry. He was your boyfriend, wasn't he? But if he told somebody that Asai Tadao was still alive, we'd be done. Your future is my treasure. That was the last thing I want to lose. If I die here, I won't bother anybody. Don't worry. I burn to death so that the police can't collate my fingerprints or face. Stop saying a bad joke. Oshitani's body will be found soon. The police look for a man named Koshikawa Mutsuo. I'm too old to manage to elude capture. I'll let you get away. I'll find the place where nobody can find you! It's impossible. It's possible! I'm tired. I'm very tired. I've spent my life hiding for 26 years. I'm tired of escaping and hiding. I want to be free. Please let me be free. Please. Dad. I have a lot of happy memories too. Thank you, Hiromi Be happy, all right? How can they do such a thing? If I had to die, I'd choose other methods. I shudder just thinking about being burned to death. Dad. Get lost! Even though you're there, I set fire to me. Get lost! Don't come! Don't come! Don't come! I'm sorry. You got sadness in your heart to protect me. But don't worry. I'll protect you this time. Hiromi. You told me that you shuddered just thinking about being burned to death, right? Yes, I did. Dad. Thank you for everything. Thank you, Hiromi. The curtain falls soon. Yes. I'm finally able to lower the curtain. It was a long tragedy. This is a letter that my father wrote before he died to you. To me? Yes. He asked me to send this to you secretly. To, Kaga Kyoichiro Dear Sir, I'm Watabe Shunichi whom your mother had taken very good care of me. Since I became decrepit and going to die soon, I want you to know what your mother thought when she lived by sending you a letter. Yuriko most likely suffered from depression. She thought about committing suicide and hung in there when she saw her son's cute sleeping face. But a terrible thing happened one day. When her husband was away from home for many days, Mom? "What was I going to do with a knife?" "If I were going to commit suicide, it would be fine" "But if I intended to force my son to die with me..." Ever since having thought so, she hadn't been able to sleep well for a long time. Then, she decided to leave home. Kaga When I came to Tokyo, I visited your place. I knew that both you and your father were in good condition, and you won the Kendo tournaments recently. So, he is still playing Kendo... This is for you. I don't have the right to keep this magazine. But... I gave up the joy to watch him grow and the happiness to dream of the future together. And yet, I always have a dream that he sleeps right next to me. I feel like that he throws his arms around me and says, "Good morning". Even though he is already a grown man. I was a weak mother. But Kyoichiro is different. He is going to be more respectable more than his father and I imagine. I take the liberty of enclosing this magazine with the letter. I wish you all the best. Sincerely, Watabe Shunichi. To, Kaga Kyoichiro. Thank you. How much? Don't worry. Please take this. Don't worry. Sold out I've heard that you were going back to Crime Square 1. Yes. From when? From the 1st of next month. Do you miss Nihonbashi? Of course, I do. I'll miss tasty food too. And it's the town that I've chased a phantom of my mother for a long time. Wow, youâ€™re a super mommy's boy. Hey! See you next month. See you. The lie is a shadow of the truth. What do I see in that shadow? It's surely not only tragedy since the lie shows human mind.
