- Here. Let me help you. - I got it, Tina. All right, just bring-- Can you bring the-- the bag in? I'll see you in there. You can have up to five people in your room. If you want to have any more than that, you'll go into the common area of the lobby. We'll give you a menu card each day for you to decide what you would like to eat the following day. The following day? That's correct. Continental breakfast set up in the dining room every morning. Your lunch and dinner can be delivered to your room if you request. But otherwise, all meals are served in the dining room. Do you want to take a second and just deal with him? Don't let Carl fool you, he will be just fine. He thinks everyone is his son, Tony. He's always moaning about something. It sounds like he's in pain. We will get to him. His next pain treatment isn't until 9:00 a.m. and it's only 8:37 right now. Your TV channels are on the table there, and I'm going to need you to decide soon what you might want to have to eat for tomorrow. I'll leave you to it. 20 more minutes. Okay, Carl? Okay. This room is even nicer than the one we looked at before. Yeah, it's as good a place to die as anywhere else, I guess. Probably not a whole lot of repeat guests, though. I feel like I'm abandoning you. Appreciate the strings that you pulled to get me in here. I don't want you at the hospital every day. Just to come home, just pull me up off the floor. We both agreed to this. It's pain management. I still hate the thought of leaving you here. Oh, I got Nurse Cutting. -She-- she seems nice. -Oh. Yeah, she's a real ray of sunshine. There's Carl. My new bestie. This was my idea, babe. I just want to make it to Christmas. Everyday after that's going to be a bonus. I love you. I love you. Tony, it's me. You have my son. Morning, Carl. Where do you think you are going? - On a walk. - A walk? Not today, sir. How are we feeling now? Breakfast? I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry. My head hurts. Okay, I'll be getting your medication at 8:30. It's 8:17. Can I just get it now? My head is killing me. I'll be back at 8:30 with your meds. I suggest you eat something. Well, that Nurse Cutting really runs a tight ship, huh? Oh, yeah. I think she's sweet on you, though. You okay for now? Maybe-- Maybe some toast. You got it. Toast and morphine coming up. Breakfast of champions. There you go, bro. See you in a bit. One mild, one spicy. What? Oh, you're just beautiful. -That's all. -Oh, you're so sweet. No, I'm just... You're gorgeous. I bet you everybody at the hospital has their eyes on you. Oh, come on! Seriously, like you're even more beautiful today than on our wedding day. You're like this stunning woman. Thanks, babe. Now, I'm high as fuck right now but... But you're beautiful. I wish we had met, like, in high school or something. You know, we would just have a lot more time together. No, we met exactly when we should have. I want you to be happy with somebody when I'm gone. Dan, I don't want to have this conversation right now. You're not even 40, okay? You could still have kids. We haven't even thought that far. Listen, I'm just saying. There's still time for you. You could be happy with somebody. You could be happy with someone who deserves and appreciates you. Somebody who has a much smaller penis than I do. I knew there was a catch. Tony, it's me. I knew that was you. Come in, come in. Hey, how are you doing? - Can't complain. - Oh, that's good. So? You know, I always liked that picture. Oh, your mum was such a beautiful bride. The Hague, Holland. November the 30th, 1945. Hey, you remember the date. Of course, I remember the date. You know, we were quite popular with the Dutch when we liberated them from the Nazis. Yeah. Yeah, I remember you telling me those stories. God, I had never seen so many beautiful women. The Germans were trying to keep her little town Amersfoort. Yeah, we chased them out quickly and then moved on to Amsterdam. And I saw her standing by the side of the road with her little brother, your uncle Perry, waving as we marched by. And she smiled at me and blew me a kiss. I knew from that moment that I had to get back and find her. And you went back? I was like a salmon swimming upstream, but I ran and walked about 30 miles to Amersfoort, to find her. My Yana. That's a long way. When you want something bad enough, you can always keep going. The heart wants what it wants, Tony. All right, I'm tired. Do you mind if I lie down? No. I have to go take my meds anyway so you rest up and we'll talk to you in a bit. Son? Yeah. Thank you. I think he had a small box of things down in storage. Get the rest of his things from storage and load them up. Hey. Was that Carl? Yeah. ...for one time a week, get six years-- We walk out of that building house-- ...any more the-- ...need a dog which is the reason why she doesn't-- ...to just use your credit card. You want me to leave the door open? Yeah, leave it open for now. Okay, I'll be back tomorrow. - I love you. - I love you too, baby. ...have a faulty item that you get or there's some other problem with the item that you purchased. Well, you know, there may be a lot of items that you see on social media or you may get an email... - Morning. - Morning. Don't forget to eat a little something with your pills. There's more food in the dining room if you want. Excuse me, can you help me figure out what's wrong with my TV? Can't right now. It's breakfast time. ...verify that website and look for an S. What I mean by that, when you see HTTP... Can I get an extra remote? ...you do not want to put any card information, any-- make any purchases. Hey, hi. Hi, you have to choose the input that you want. -Pardon me. -Do you want me to just come in? - I can show you. - Sure. Sure. Yes. I think this has same problem. I think that the default is actually connected to the-- This is a little complicated but once you get that there, it should be good to go. Look at that. - Thank you so much. - All set. Thank you so much. I'm Robyn, by the way. Oh, Dan. - Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. What happened to your hand? Oh, I fell. Well, that happens sometimes. Sorry about the music earlier. Well, that's okay. Mornings are just a little bit hard for me. It's stage four. Stage four. Enjoy your stay. Thank you. Hey. Dan, I was wondering if you could go for a walk with me outside. -Oh, I don't know. -Please. You're the only person here who's not 100 years old. I fall down a lot. And if I fell down outside... I'll carry you back myself. They say I need to stay active. We don't have to go far. Please. My wife's going to be here for lunch in like 37 minutes. -So... -Plenty of time. I'll get my coat. So what's with the lake this morning? Well, the theory is if you subject yourself to extremes like the cold, your body will respond by using its natural dormant toughness to fight off sickness and disease. So we all have this toughness inside of us? That's the theory. You're stronger than you think. I just want to make it to Christmas. It's my goal anyway. It's a good goal. How about you? Oh, well, my birthday is February 2nd, so it would be nice to make it there. It's Groundhog Day. Yes. Maybe I'll see my shadow and get six more weeks of life. Come in. It's open. Jesus Christ. Jesus! Trick or treat. You're giving me treats? Okay, reversed trick or treat. -You want to come? -Where? I'm giving out candy to people. I don't have a costume. I got this. Look at you two! Happy Halloween, Flo. Would you like some candy? Really? -Take as much as you want. -Thank you. Is that all you want? -Take some more. -Am I allowed to take more? Yes, sweetie, take some more. I love chocolate. -Thank you so, so much. -You're so welcome. Happy Halloween. Hello. Happy Halloween, Dolores. -Take some candy. -Oh! You have black liquorice! Oh, take as much as you want. Thank you. You've made my day. Oh, you're so welcome, love. - Enjoy, okay? - Thank you. All right, next one's mine. Come in. -Happy Halloween, Eddie. -What the fuck? Fuck off. No, it's Halloween. Like, you trick or treat, see? I'm not giving you shit. Get the fuck out of my room. Now we're here to give you candy. -Like if you want it. -I don't want nothing. -Sorry, Edward. -Oh! We were just giving out some candy. -We'll leave you alone. -What have we here? I didn't know it was the both of you. Come in and let me get a good look at you. Not you, shithead. Just this pretty witch. What do you got for me, sweetie? -Some candy. -This is very kind of you. -What's your name? -I'm Robyn. When did you start working here, Robyn? I haven't seen you before. I'm a resident here, Edward, just like you are. No shit. Is the rest of you green too, or just your face? Wouldn't you like to know? God damn right I would. Would you like to see a little chocolate? Oh, yes, please. You are trouble. Here's a little chocolate to tide you over. Thank you, beautiful. Happy Halloween, Eddie. Go fuck yourself. Bye, Edward. Bye, sweetie. What are you two doing? Reverse trick or treating. Residents here can't eat whatever they want, whenever they want. We need to keep their routine structured. It's just a little candy. And what if they were diabetics or allergic to peanuts? They would've told us, I guess. Let us handle feeding those in our care. Thank you. What a buzz-kill! Thanks though. This was fun. Simple pleasures. Happy Halloween. Happy Halloween. Oh Jesus, Cheryl! The kids thought it would be fun to give candy to the geezers. Oh, come on, Cheryl. Let them have some fun. It's probably their last Halloween. We don't make the rules, okay? It's our job to enforce them. Reversed trick or treat! Almost gave Edward a heart attack. Morning. Morning. Oh, and no lake this morning? No, I'm feeling a little tired. -What happened to your eye? -I fell. It looks a lot worse than it is though. But I get this off today, finally. Hi, I'm Tina. Oh, I'm sorry. Robyn, this is-- This is my wife, Tina. - Nice to meet you. - I love your accent. -Thank you. -Do you want to join us? No. I think I'm going to eat in my room today. But I should be up for a walk later Dan, you free? Yeah, sure. I should be back after lunch. -Cool. Nice meeting you. -And you too. She seems nice. Yeah, she's All right. So, is there anything else you want to do today when we're out? -Happy now? -Mm-hmm. And this feels okay? Yeah, it feels good. Hey, thanks for doing this today. -I know you're busy. -No. Just some paperwork and then I'll be back at 6:30, okay? Okay. See you later. Hey, Robyn? Whoa, Dan, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got you, bro. You good? I'm okay. Can you stand all the way up? I'm okay. Let me take you back to your room? No. I'm going to go eat in the dining room. You sure? I can get it for you. I'm okay. I got it. Okay, cool. It's all you, Dan. Hey, look at that. No brace? Oh, yeah, it's good as new. Huh. Dan, this is my husband, Jeff. -Hey, Jeff. -Hey, nice to meet you. And thank you for taking Robyn on the walks. Appreciate it. Oh, no worries. I actually look forward to doing those now. Oh, you're so sweet. Jeff's boss changed his plan so he doesn't have to fly today. -Are you a pilot? -Yeah, just one client. So I'm always on call. Oh, who's your client? He's not allowed to say it. Anyway, we'll let you enjoy your lunch. Nice to meet you, Dan. You sure, you are okay? Yeah, I'm actually really good now. Okay. Enjoy the burger. Simple pleasures. So you think Eddie left me anything in the will? Huh! Edward! May he rest in peace. Oh, I don't know. Seemed to like you a lot. You know, I bet he was thinking about you when he was jerking the gherkin. Gave him a heart attack in the end. You are a terrible person! So what did you do before you got to this place? I was in charge of the regional office of the Jamaican Tourism Board. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. How about you? Accountant. -Oh! -Yeah, I know, nothing exciting but I just like to have everything in order, you know? All the numbers in place. -I liked it. -Yeah. Was there anything you wanted to do before you got sick? Oh, before I started falling down all the time, I signed up for my first marathon. That would have been quite an accomplishment. Yeah, I guess. What about you? I was slowly getting Jeff to come around to the idea of moving to Jamaica for at least half the year. You miss it, eh? Well, you always miss home. Family, the food, the culture. -Ting. -What's ting? It's the most delicious soda you'll ever have. It's made with real grapefruit and a dash of glorious Jamaican sunshine. Oh, you should do marketing for them. So Jeff seems great. Hmm. He's amazing. He really surprised me when he turned out to be such a great caregiver. I think he thought he failed me when the cancer came back. Tina couldn't blame me or the cancer so she blamed herself when the cancer became inoperable. She's also a nurse so that made things even more hard. We're pretty lucky to have them. Yeah. Maybe we should just get them together when we... pass. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I know what you're trying to say. Let's head back, okay? Shit! The what? The Death Doula. She's coming tomorrow. She's supposed to help us ease into our transition. Maybe you could invite Tina. It sounds kind of morbid. Come on. I think she could really help us. Okay, sure. We'll be there. Look, I really wanted to apologize for earlier because-- I want to try. Try what? Getting Jeff and Tina together. Let's do it. Hey, woah, woah, woah, so-- I admit, I was mad earlier when you suggested it. It made me feel like I had nothing to look forward to. I have nothing to hope for. Now I do. Okay, Robyn, that was just a passing thought. All right? Don't listen to me. I have brain cancer. I'm literally losing my mind. They could be a good match. She's smart and sexy and seems very nice. Jeff, oh, he's well-educated, kind, healthy, handsome. Plus, he's always wanted to have children. Okay, this is crazy. I'm sorry, I got mad at you for suggesting this. I was-- I wasn't suggesting anything. We're going to make it until Christmas, right? Yeah. Yeah, of course we are. So let's focus on trying to make them happy when we're gone. It can be our final gift to them. -I just don't think I could-- -Just think about it. They don't have to be together forever. Could just be nice for them to have someone else going through the same thing as they are. Someone to talk to. Someone to be with. Okay. I'll think about it. You're such a good man. Okay. Preparing for your death isn't just about signing over the house, making sure your daughter gets the good china or that your son gets the vintage Mustang in the garage. That's the easy part. What's difficult is ending your story without a heart full of regrets. Let's try a little exercise and share some energy. Everyone, close your eyes, please. We are going to visit your deathbed. Where are you? What do you hear? What are the smells? How does the fabric feel on your skin? Are you surrounded by your loved ones? Is there any unfinished business between you and them? Anything you've left unsaid? Oh, God. No more bucket list now. You won't be going to Machu Picchu or surfing the Great Barrier Reef in this lifetime, but you can ask yourself this one last question. What must I do to exist as boldly and honestly as I can so that I may live in the present and die with dignity? Now is the time for you to bridge the gap between who you are right now, today, and the person or the version of yourself that you meet on your deathbed. So be bold and be brave today, because none of us knows how many tomorrows we might have left. - Hey. - Hey. How's your morning? Stressful. This was hard. -Really? -Yeah. I got 11 things, though. I should be good. You could only think of 11 things your wife enjoys? Yeah, how many did you get? 119 as of now. 119. Wow, I suck. I got meatballs for Robyn. Thanks, honey. I got honey garlic chicken wings for Dan. -Hey, Ronny. -Hey. I got you. -Thank you. -And Dan, you don't suck. Oh, thanks, Ronny. Okay, listen. It's quality, not quantity, right? Let's hear them. Okay, Thai food. Loves Thai food. Likes Seinfeld, Jon Bon Jovi, but not his music. Gardening, loves to garden. Foot massages, grocery shopping, driving fast, basketball, crocheting, crocheting. Stephen King, loves Stephen King. And of course, Jeopardy. Big Jeopardy fan. -Okay. Oh, it's not bad. -Yeah. I'm getting a good picture of her. -Give me yours. Give me yours. -Hmm. Well, so, Jeff, he loves skipping rocks on any body of water that he passes. He loves dogs. Any dog that comes up to him, he'll just pet the dog. He's a big cereal buff. When he's browsing through the cereal aisles, he always ends up choosing the same things. He loves the band Queen. Flying, despite it being his job. Horror movies, video games, black jelly beans. Adam Sandler, Sudoku, ping pong, blackjack. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Dave Chappelle. -Oh, and spicy guacamole. -Oh. Hmm. Is that it? For now. I mean, I just thought of the guacamole. Awesome. Eat your lunch. -Oh, let's go look. -What? It doesn't look safe. I don't think we should go in. Come on, scaredy cat. Robyn! I have a surprise for you. For me? Well... -For both of us. -You're bad. Hey, it's legal now. Jeff's client sent it for me. It's a special high grain mix. You should feel privileged to partake. I'm honoured. It still feels... Well, I don't know, have you tried this treatment? I've tried everything. How about you? I haven't smoked a joint since high school. Well, here you go. All right, but... This stuff never really did much for me. Horseshit. -Come on. -Stop! No, I can't. No, like-- Like, okay. Okay. Is this person on TV? I can't say, I don't know what you want. Don't be a dickhead. Don't be a dickhead, okay? -Is this person a musician? -Stop! Okay, fine. Yes, he is a musician. Don't say a thing. It's a he. It's a he. It's a he. Don't you have somebody to do this for you? Only I do my laundry right. How are you feeling? I feel good. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. -You want to dance? -Oh, no, no, that's-- That's not my jam, as the kids say. Come on, Dan. -I can't. -Come on. I'm horrible. Just move like this, Okay? See? Okay, now I want you to move your hips like this. - Yeah, right. - Try. Uh-huh. Come on. Come on. Here, follow me. Right here. Okay, Dan. See? You have some moves. As a courtesy to our other residents, please don't play the music so loudly with the door open. -Sorry, I was just-- -It was my fault. That was my fault because I left-- -I left the door open. -Here are your meds. So much of that coming from that left wing-back position. I think I'm going to go, babe. Early day tomorrow. Peter's in. Do you have to go? Tina hates tinsel. I don't hate it. I just think it makes the tree look a little, I don't know, junkie. Tina, you have to add Tinsel. It gives the tree a shimmer, right? Shimmer? What's shimmer? A shimmer? Oh, yes, a shimmer. Okay. Yeah. Well, see, I could take tinsel and just throw a tree, let it cascade down. Look at that. Looks good. - You see what I mean, Robyn? - Dan. You have to place them individually like this. Make it look even. Well, that's great, if you want it to take forever. Oh, you have some place to be? Funny. Funny. Okay. Let's see, All right, well, yeah. A shimmer. Shimmer. I like Dan's technique better. Looks a lot more fun. - Baby! - Surprise! I thought you were flying out tonight. I am on my way to airport now. I just wanted to say bye. - Oh, you're so sweet. - Hey, Tina. -How's it going? -Hi. So, Dan, I heard you and Robyn have been naughty. What do you mean? Oh, I thought you'd like what my boss sent over. Oh, really? Cheech and Chong? Yeah, I mean, we tried it a little bit. I think it's helping. Well, I'm glad. You want to dance with me, baby? Sure. I'm not feeling very good, I'm going to-- I'm just going to sit down. Tina, could you come and cut in? Oh, no, I'm okay. Come on, girl. You've had just as much wine as I have. Jeff, dance with Tina. Sure, if it's okay with Dan. Yeah, sure. Yeah. I mean, if you want to dance. Hey, Merry Christmas. Thanks. I mean, you did it. You made it to Christmas. Yeah. That's right. Congratulations. I'm so happy for you. Thanks. Here. Next milestone is February 2nd, right? If I'm alive, I'll be here. Really? If I'm lying, I'm dying. I heard the TV. Two more minutes? Come, sit. Come, sit. Where's Tina? -Oh, hospital. Night shift. -Mm-hmm. She did leave some of this, though. -You want some? -Yes, please. Sorry, no champagne for us tonight. -That's okay. -Here you go. What? Where's Jeff? Vegas, last minute. His boss is ringing in the new year. He'll be back tomorrow. Well, cheers. Cheers. -Happy New Year. -Happy New Year. Mm, we made it. Hmm. We both did. Yeah. Let's do one more. To... the diehards. The diehards. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Oh, sorry. Did I hurt you? I'm not going to break. It's so nice to feel sexy again. Smoke show. You should have seen me when I was younger. Miss Jamaica Runner Up, 2003. I love your skin. Am I the first black women you've ever been with? You might be the first brunette I've ever been with. Okay, so how was it? It was all right. -Yeah, that's true. -But you were there. What are you up to? What do you mean? You didn't need your medication this morning? Oh, yeah, thank you. We said 8:30 every morning, correct? Yeah. Happy New Year. Jesus, never lights up. You feeling good this morning? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you didn't have to take your medication. Oh. I don't know, I just feel very... floaty. -Floaty? -Yeah. I like that. What are your plans today? Um... Uh, Jeff is coming for dinner. He's flying back from Vegas right now. Hmm. Maybe the four of us could get together for a New Year's dinner? You are determined to play Cupid on this one. Well, like I said, it gives us something to feel useful. Purpose. I can pick us all up whatever we want. Are we good? Yeah, we're good. Should we tell them? Well, I mean, if we were going to tell them, it would just be to relieve our own guilt, right? Well, I try to do the right thing one way or another. Well, what if I said I didn't feel that guilty about it? Then I would say that you're not alone in that feeling. I-- What if everything happens for a reason? Maybe fate or serendipity, destiny brought us together at the end of our lives. Like a gift or something. You know, that's the way I see it. That's Flo's son. She loved her chocolate. Well, she made it to the new year. Life is short, yeah. Too short. -Oops, sorry. -Jeez! -Watch it. -Cheryl, I, um-- I forgot my phone in the other room. So what's that then? Oh, yeah, sorry about that. Excuse me, please. Absolutely. She can't say anything, right? Like it's against the, you know, that oath. The-- The-- -The Hippocratic oath? -Yes. -She's not a doctor. -You're right. We should definitely be looking for a place to bury her. Right now. Anywhere here. Anywhere here. Ah, you know, maybe this is a sign. We should stop doing what we're doing. We're supposed to be dead, Robyn. There's no time for regrets. Besides, I'm not going to feel bad for acting on my feelings. Strong words, Dan. I feel strongly about you. Feel like a teenager, you know, unhealthy teenager. You're a crazy man. Love this woman! Jeff, I have to say, I'm impressed. You really hooked us up here. You're giving me too much credit, big guy. This is a one stop shop in a mega store. What a time we live in. Here, let me try. I did a little shopping too. Hey! -Let me try. -Ooh, nice. I also have apple cider in case anyone is on medication. Oh, not me. I'm med-free tonight. I haven't taken a pill since this morning, I've been looking forward to this all day. -Let's drink. -Are you in pain? Not for long. Red, please. I'm sorry, they're plastic. Oh, no. No worries. -Thank you. -That was good, babe. I have to make a toast. To your friendships, to the surprises that still await us in life. To getting through another year. Happy New Year. -Happy New Year. -Happy New Year. So you really haven't had any meds all day today? -No, why? -You look good. - You look healthy. - Yeah? Mm-hmm. That must be the candle light. Or the walks you're taking. Robyn, you look so beautiful. Oh, now I know it must be the candle light. Well, whatever it is you guys are doing, keep it up. Mmm, so... I was flying to Kabul yesterday with my boss, right? Now this boss, what's his name again? -I can't tell you. -One of these days. -No. -One of these days. I'm shutting it down, he's going to slip. I know you, you have some wine in you. Why don't we talk about the chickens that we found? You got to hear this. The chickens? It was last Wednesday when we were taking the walk. It had to be Tuesday because it was right after meatloaf night and Wednesday's spaghetti night. Yeah, yeah, okay. You're right about meatloaf. You're right. You're right. Anyway, we found these chickens, and I was so amazed. I didn't know had wild chickens here. We have them in Jamaica. You saw that one and you ended up naming him. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had-- -Right? See I had named him after my grandfather. So we named him Peter. There's no such thing as a chicken who looks like a person. This one did. I wanted to take them back but you wouldn't let me because you thought we'd be caught. But I'm telling you, we could have got away with it. We could've kept it in your room. We could've kept it in your room. It's big enough. Anyway, maybe we'll see them again, I'm not sure, but, yeah. This is really nice. I'm really glad we're doing this. Thank you. You sure had a good appetite tonight. Yeah, I guess I was actually hungry. What's wrong? Nothing. You sure? You do look good tonight, Dan. Tonight, I saw the man who wasn't sick. The man I fell in love with. That's a good thing, right? It should be. You're in love with Robyn. - What are you talking about? - Don't. Just don't. There is no one who knows you like I do. There is no one who has been through more with every version of you than I have. Yeah, I guess, I am. It's not like we even-- Do you know that during your last round of treatment, my sister told me that Jerry was having an affair? She wanted to leave him. It was all I could do, not to tell her how childish she was being. An affair! Who fucking cares? I would have given anything for my biggest concern about you to have been an affair instead of inoperable brain cancer. But now I have both. So there's that. Do you feel better? Yeah. I haven't had any kind of pain or seizures in the last few weeks. Yeah, I do. Okay. Let's see how you feel over the next couple of days. Maybe we can go get another scan and hope for the best. Let's count today as a win, All right? You've made it through Christmas to the new year. We should be grateful. I'm sorry. I'll get over it. But not today. Dan, fuck you. Good morning. The pills on the table. Make sure you take them with food. Morning. Oh, hey. Morning. No reggae music this morning? No. She's still sleeping. Oh, thanks for last night. It was a lot of fun. Please, it's the least I can do. You've helped out Robyn a lot, you know? With your friendship and the walks. I mean, she's still with us, right? Yeah, she's helped me a lot too. You look great, Dan. It looks like you could walk out of here any day now. Yeah, wouldn't that be something? Tina knows. You told her. I didn't have too. Women just know these things, dude. Even if they don't know that they know, they know. How did she take it? Well, she's pretty happy about me being okay but the rest of the stuff, well, we'll see how it goes. I do have to say, Dan, you've been looking pretty good. How's your vision been? No blurriness, no puking. I'm feeling great. That's awesome. Tina says that if I keep feeling better, we can book another a scan. Easy there. Hey. Just give me a few seconds. Dan? Dan, if you fall... They'll fire me. We're gonna have to kick you out of this place. Has anybody actually left the hospice? Sure. Sometimes they go right to the hospital for more treatment or sometimes they leave just because they're feeling better. Getting their meds on time or socializing with people. How long does that last? Usually not very long. But they do leave with more dignity. Their lives end on their own terms. So when are you getting your results back? I mean, technician sends the scans the doctors, so I don't know, maybe tomorrow. Hmm. Going to pray for good news. Will you just stay with me tonight? Hmm. I'm not going anywhere. Hello? Dan, this is Dr. Shaler. How are you doing? You tell me. How am I doing? Well, I have heard about these things, but I've never actually seen it, Dan. Never seen what? You're in remission. The tumours are shrinking. A few of them have almost disappeared. I still need you to come in for some blood reports and we want to run a few more tests. But it looks really good, Dan. Dan? Are you there? Hello? Hello? Hello? Dan? Oh, he... What does he think he's doing? -Oh, he's in. He's in the water. -Blankets, quick. -Oh, okay. Yeah. -I gonna fucking live. I'm gonna live. Oh, fuck this is cold. Holy fuck, this is cold. I don't think cold plunge is going to be my thing any more. You didn't. I did. You got good news. I'm in remission. I couldn't have done this without you. Oh, nonsense, crazy man. I told you, you are stronger than you think. Oh God, you made me stronger. You need to leave now. Are you going-- I mean, do you want to eat lunch? I mean, I can go and I can get you something, bring it back. I mean, you need to leave Serenity. This place isn't for you any more. Besides, someone would be needing your bed. What's the rush? That means I can't see you any more. I don't want to see you any more, Dan. I wish you well. Don't come back. Can I at least come visit. I want to see you. If you love me the way I think you do, you will check out today and never come back. I do love you. I love you. Go tell Tina the good news. Hey. Hey, Tina. Yeah? I'm going to need a ride home. Really? Yeah, the doctor says I'm in remission. Okay. I'm on my way. Dan. Dan. -Yeah. -You All right? Yeah. Well, it's great to have you back, man. Thank you. You sure you're okay? Actually, I'm going to get some air. All right. I'm sorry. What? A marathon. Tomorrow. I'm out of the whole thing at work, I'm good to go. I mean, Dan, I know that you're feeling pretty high on life right now, and I think that's wonderful, but don't you think you should train before you run that far? I got it all figured out. I'm gonna pack up some food. There's no certain time I want to finish. -I just want to finish. -It's February. It's freezing outside. That just means I'm not going to need as much water. What? Why tomorrow? Why not wait a few weeks for spring? Because spring's too late. It needs to be tomorrow. I thought she didn't want to see you. There's something I want to bring her for her birthday. -What are you bringing her? -A ting. What's a Ting? It's just this kind of pop that she likes. So you want to put yourself through all of that after recovering from brain cancer to bring her a pop? Well, when you put it that way, it sounds pretty silly. Dan, I'm serious. I just got you back. Don't put yourself in more danger. I made her a promise. -I owe her, Tina. -You owe me! Look, I know that you think that she was some kind of angel who was sent to cure you. And I can't hate her. Because at the end of it, you're here. But that doesn't mean that it's easy for me to watch you go run to her. And what if you start running and you don't want to come back? Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I owe you. I owe you for being my nurse, after coming home every day from being a nurse. You were putting your life completely on hold for me, help me find a battle I was never supposed to win. I owe you my life. I have to do this. I have to do this run. But I need you to know that you are my finish line. Oh, Dan. Wow. You look so good. Oh, Dan. Dan! Hey, Dan. Dan, if you've come to visit, you have to go back and sign in, and I'll let you know-- Why don't you sit your ass down, Cheryl? Dan. Yo Dan. She's not doing so well. Just be prepared for that, okay? I thought I banned you from coming back here. Well, I must be still having brain issues because I don't remember that. Mm-hmm. You naughty boy. Happy birthday. You made it. -Yeah? -Mm-hmm. I guess, I did. Where's Jeff? He's getting me a birthday lunch. Curry chicken? Mm-hmm. I don't have much of an appetite but I'll try. You feeling okay? Why are you sweating? I ran all the way here. Yeah, I ran and I walked. Crazy man! There's something I had to give you for your birthday. Hmm? It might be a little bit frozen though. Can't believe you remembered. The simple pleasures. Simple pleasures. I'll have it with my birthday lunch. I have something for you as well. Yeah? It's... It's in the night-stand. It has Kate's name on it but it's for you. I wanted to give it to you after. No, put it in your pocket, don't read it now. I'll be too embarrassed. Okay. How are you feeling? Not too good, I'm afraid. Any pain? Constant. How about meds? Hmm. You know Nurse Cutting. Stronger doses but only at the prescribed times. I think I'm all out after tomorrow's. Do you still have, you know, just in case? Crush it up if you want it. I've been closer a few times but I wanted to make it to today. It gave me something. A purpose. You got it. I don't think I could do it anyway. What about Jeff? You think he would? Help? I couldn't ask him to do that. He wouldn't be able to live with himself. How's Tina doing? She's pretty pissed right now. Because of the run thing but I think we're going to be okay. You have a good wife, Dan. Hold on to her. Yeah, she's great. How far are you running today? Well... Crap. I am on a marathon here. Only half a way. You crazy man. I know you can do it. I wish I was this confident. Can't stop now. You have to keep going. Are you sure? You're stronger than you think. Wait. I want a sip first. You okay? You okay? It's worth it. One more. Delicious. I'll have the rest with my lunch. Thank you. - I love you. - Hmm. I love you. Enjoy the rest of your journey. "My dearest Dan. Well, if you are reading this, that means you outlasted me. As unhappy as I am to be dying, the thought of you living brings me great joy. What has happened is a miracle. And I don't just mean how you went into remission. I mean how we were able to connect. Maybe we both felt lost and alone and we clung to each other the way we wanted to cling to life. But I think our souls have known each other for thousands of years, and every now and then they meet up. I know it sounds silly, but I want to believe there is more waiting for me on the other side. And I hope that you or some form of you will be on the other side someday and we will see each other again. Meanwhile, you can't waste this second chance that you've been given. Now is the time to do all the things you've always wanted do. Believe me, I am not regretting any chances I've taken in my life right now. Just the things that I didn't do. You are a kind, sexy, funny, caring, and a surprisingly passionate lover. You deserve every bit of happiness that will come your way for many, many years. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that you are wonderful and that you are loved. Robyn."
