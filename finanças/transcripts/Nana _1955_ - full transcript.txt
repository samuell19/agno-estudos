A TECHNICOLOR MOTION PICTURE BY CHRISTIAN JAQUE. BASED ON THE NOVEL BY EMILE ZOLA -Count? -Do you have an appointment? -I have a letter of introduction. -That was a mistake. Tell his Majesty Count Muffat is in his office. Oh! It's the emperor. Allow me to hand my prerogative to the empress. My pleasure. So, Muffat, is this serious? Are you still resigning? I'm preparing to leave as we speak, Sir. With no regrets? In infinite sorrow. What if I ordered you to stay? I would obey my conscience. And fail your duty? I have to disassociate myself from your successive abdications, Sir. Well now. It was a foolish abdication of power to allow such liberty to a press that has shown itself unworthy, as it was to abandon your powers to a parliament in which men from the old parties work towards what they barbarously call "the decomposition of the capital authority" and to allow salons of opposition where members of your own family conspire against you. I had hoped to be the Loyola of the empire. But how can I be heard in a country that allows science to undermine God? The men of December 2 no longer have a role to play. I've lost the will to continue amid this moral anarchy and while Your Majesty sees no wrong, I see no point in making plans in a burning house. But the house that you are fleeing also belongs to the crown prince. The basis of my devotion is religious, not dynastic, Sir. Why do you judge so harshly? Sir, why do you not judge more harshly the spectacle offered to you by your court? Disorder and corruption have assailed the Tuileries. In the empress's entourage, ambassadors' wives act like harlots. I like you too much to lose my temper, my dear Muffat. Your weakness is my greatest concern, Sir. Yes, indeed. I have a great weakness for your personality. You've spared me nothing. Service is my only watchword. Then serve me. We need strong characters, Muffat. I'm asking you to stay. We've been through difficult times and shared in our hopes. We almost died together and triumphed together. We must continue together. Come on, Muffat. Muffat. So be it. Now, let us talk seriously. The Duc du Bassano has been called to his wife's bedside. He was supposed to accompany our guest, the prince of Sardinia. Oblige me by taking his place. The prince of Sardinia is a charming man. You are to dine with him and take him to the theater. I know such entertainment appeals little to you, but you'll be free before midnight, I give you my word. You know what we expect from the prince's visit. That is reason enough for me to accept the mission, Sir. Tell Gaston to prepare my clothes. I won't be dining here tonight. Is my wife here? Yes, with Mr. Fauchery, who just arrived. -Hello, Fauchery. -Hello, Daddy. How can you allow Estelle to wear such a neckline? Oblige me and change. -But, Daddy... -Do as I say. Have a seat, Fauchery. I brought the proofs for my article. Why are you crying? Oh, Mr. VÃ©not, my father thinks my neckline looks indecent. But really... He's quite right. This is very good, but the title is useless now. I withdrew my resignation. -I am delighted to hear it. -Did you tell the emperor? Rest assured, I spoke my mind. The Countess spoke of your daughter's engagement to Lieutenant Philippe Hugon. May I congratulate you? That would be somewhat premature. Excuse me, I'm due with the prince of Sardinia. I must dress. I haven't thanked you for the lilies. Who told you they're my favorites? I just had to think of you to guess what you like. You thought of me? I won't allow it. That may not be possible, I don't allow it myself, but my love is stronger than my will. Be silent, Sir. I am an honest woman. No one has ever dared to talk to me in this manner. No one? Virtue must have made your friends blind, senseless, deaf and dumb and foolish. God did not make me virtuous. He wanted me happy. Obey His will, since you keep his company. Is that all? Yes, I've said everything. I love you and desire you. I'll go, having made a good impression. Get your newspaper here! Newspapers! Get your newspaper! Get your newspaper here! Newspapers! Newspapers! What on earth is this prince doing? I dressed for him. I prepared for him and he hasn't even come. Who does he think I am? Where was he raised? The king of Greece was on time. So were Alexander and Vladimir. And they came from Russia. The evening isn't over yet. It's not over. The third act has just begun. And it's short. -I mean, really! -It doesn't matter. You don't care about respect. You patrons don't care, so long as you make a profit. My profits wouldn't pay for a packet of cigarettes. What are you talking about? You only smoke cigars. And on that subject, are you getting rid of Rose Mignon? Your information is good. Her husband is accommodating. -You'll never find better. -No. -But then there's the woman. -And she's trouble. Yes. Tell me, what do you think of Nana? -Nana? -Yes. In bed, she's first class. Extraordinary. Ten times better than on the stage. She's great. And I'm not easily impressed. -Better than Rose? -Better than them all. I don't know where she gets it, but she never lets up. And she's so sweet and good natured. She just doesn't care! She's perfect. Steiner, if you leave Rose, Mignon will be unconsolable. He already knows my successor. A very good man. -Mr. Bordenave. -What? Steiner, you have some influence on her. -Rose won't go on stage. -What? She says she won't go on without the prince of Sardinia here. I never heard anything like it! The prince of Sardinia! Where is that bitch? And you're telling me that, as her husband? Husbands are all the same. What's the matter? Won't you go on stage? I'm not going to open up for Nana. If you don't go on, you're fired. I'll kick you out! You'll fire me? It's Steiner's money. Yes, but I'm the boss. Get on. They're playing. -Did you see that tart? -Yes, I did. -Oh, I am sorry. -Don't mention it. Women! I only respect my mother and that's only because of who she is. -My wife's good, isn't she? -Yes, I know. Steiner, think about this, before you do anything. In all of our interests. She likes us, you know. Anyway, there's nothing stopping you from spending some time with Nana. On the contrary! Only the top hats are clapping. That's not fair. -Nana. -Good evening. Is the prince here yet? I'm afraid he's not coming. He might have said! Foreigners think they can do as they please. -Did you think it over? -Think it over? Ah, yes, I thought it over. Fontan, of course. Will you stop pinching my ass? I'm sentimental by nature. It reminds me of the good old days. I keep coming back. You fool. After the show, there'll be champagne in my room. What? Are you crazy? -It's my birthday. -You can be generous once a year. Once every ten years. I'm turning 30. Already? What are you giving me for my 30th birthday? So, regrets. No, hope. I like you, you know. Of course you do. Oh! Stop doing that! Stop pinching my ass. I can hardly speak! You can do what you like in life, so long as you have a home base. I've got one. My bank. Well, Steiner? Are we still dining together tonight? Naturally. I reserved a private room. You don't like to be disturbed at times like that. I've never heard anything like it! They're all on their feet. That's not for you. It's the prince of Sardinia. I thought as much. That's too bad. You're off, he's arrived and it's my turn. Or your robe's turn. We all have our talents, don't we? Flaunt your robe's train. That's your soliloquy. I don't need a robe for success. That's what they applaud. Oh, do they really? Do they applaud my robe? Then I'll go on without it! Nana! What? If I haven't got enough on, then cover me in applause! Thank you for your acclamation. Music, maestro! -What a great idea that was. -Extraordinary. You'd never have thought of that. What a cheek! What pleasure overwhelms me? What happiness fills me, Troubles and bewilders me, So violently? Why do I suddenly feel so happy And ready to indulge In a thousand extravagances? A thousand extravagances. It's because I was just informed That Orestes, my lover, murdered my husband, As he had promised me. I was just informed That Orestes, my lover, murdered my husband, As he promised. Orestes, there you are. What a beautiful murder. Stay here. I am your reward. Now, come on. Let's have some fun and make gentle love. It's time for our happiness to begin. Our happiness is beginning. I was just informed that Orestes, my lover, murdered my husband, as he promised. I was told this instant that my lover murdered my husband, as he promised me. We would very much like to pay our respects to Nana. Nothing would be easier to arrange, Your Highness. Please, Your Highness, follow me. This way. Yes. Everybody to my dressing room, for champagne. My treat. What? Is the world coming to an end? Did you hear? The drinks are on Fontan! Except for understudies and small parts, of course. Everyone is invited, except everyone. I'm absolutely famished! So, the prince came, after all. Yes, he's so handsome. One of those Sardinian types. Is that the right word? They're not sardines! France, French. Sardinia, Sardinian, -Germany... -Germanian? I didn't think of that. Will Your Highness come in? No, I'm not dressed! All the more reason! These gentleman know what a pretty lady looks like. They saw you on stage, right? Of course. Come on, Nana, we won't eat you. I can't promise that. The young lady whetted our appetites. Would you like breast or thigh? Hurry up, Nana. We're waiting for you. Let me take off my bracelet. She's just taking off her bracelet. Is this your first visit to our theater, Count Muffat? I came a long time ago. They were performing Musset's L'habit vert. That wasn't under my management. In those days people came for the plays, not for the pretty girls. -So, Nana. -I'm coming, I'm coming. Your Highness must forgive this disorderly reception. I couldn't resist the desire to compliment you. Do you know Count Muffat? I haven't had the pleasure. Count. Let's not stand. Please, sit down. Yes, sit down, sit down. Don't you think it's a bit hot? How can you live in such a temperature? I'm going to slip into something more comfortable. -Did your Highness enjoy our play? -Very much, thanks to you. Yes, I know what I'm talking about. Your Highness must be used to it. We're not as spoiled in Sardinia as you are in Paris. But Sardinian artists... Hey, sweetie pie! Sorry, you've got company. Come in. Don't be afraid. Fontan, who plays Prince Pilade. His Highness, the prince. -Your Highness. -Same to you. -The Marquis de Muffat. -Count Muffat. Oh, marquis, count - it's all the same. Please excuse me, but it's my birthday today and... He's buying us all champagne. Come on. Hortense, get the things from my room. How old are you? My Highness is 30, Your Highness. To be 30, in Paris, at the VariÃ©tÃ©s, in Nana's dressing room is a prince's dream. Isn't that right? I'm at the VariÃ©tÃ©s in Nana's room every day, and my dream is... I don't know. I always dream we've lost 1,000 francs. What a nightmare! I dreamed you overpaid me by 1,000 francs. That's where it went! Here are the glasses and the champagne. Thank you. Give the lady a glass. -Hortense doesn't like champagne. -What? Of course I like champagne. So, she likes it. Come in, come in. Let me introduce the prince of Sardinia. Your Highness. And Count Muffat I'll host. That's an unusual part for you. -May I? -Yes. Your Highness. Poured by Cloris's charming hand. Your Highness, my charms are at your feet. She is marvelous. She can switch registers so easily. I'll speak to the comte and pour him a drink. Half a glass. Come on... Oh! I'm sorry. No harm done. Quick, a handkerchief. I'm sorry. It'll bring you luck. Now, let's toast! To Your Highness! -To the army! -To Venus! No, no, no. To Fontan. -To Fontan. -To me. Don't stand there all alone. -Well, Madame... -Please, call me Nana. To love, Count. Not to yours. One bottle wouldn't be enough. Let's toast selfishly. To both of us. -To your success, Madame. -Nana. Nana. Am I intruding? Here's Fauchery! Perfect timing. A glass for Fauchery. Have you met? I had the honor, at the Tuileries. -Oh, yes. -And Count Muffat. We met earlier this evening. What now? Good health, Highness! Lend me 10 louis. I forgot... -What for? -For the champagne. The champagne you're buying? You'll never change! I'm not 30 everyday. I don't have 10 louis everyday. Here, you're lucky to have me. -Nana. -Oh, Mr. Steiner. I can't come tonight. But you promised. The prince is here. Well, I don't want to cause a diplomatic incident. But, still... -Are you in Paris for long? -Alas, I'm leaving tomorrow. -Already! -Tomorrow afternoon. I see. Will you have dinner with me? It'd be a charming memory to take home with me. Your Highness, how could I say no to Sardinia? Hortense, my dress! -More champagne? -No, thank you. -It's the good stuff. -I'll have some. Count? -No, thank you. -Too bad. Will your Highness excuse me? Please do. I've already taken too much of your time. Since you're leaving us, may I ask you to dismiss the two security guards? -Certainly. -Thank you, Muffat. And thank you for the best evening that I've ever spent in Paris. Your Highness is too kind. Sir, Madame. Are you leaving already? All good things must come to an end, Madame. Please, Nana, not Madame. You must come back, now you know the way. Goodbye, Count, see you soon. Good night. He said he'd shower me with gold. I said no. Promises, promises... Do you still see Gustave? He's so jealous. I told him to go. Edmond's nice. I wouldn't cheat on him. Or... Sorry. Or I'd have to... -Did ThÃ©rÃ¨se tell you that? -No, it was Robert. Thank you, Sir. Take this to the Tuileries, to the empress, with this card. Thank you, Sir. Ah, Count Muffat. We really can't manage without each other. -Did you get home safely last night? -Yes, I did. You made quite an impression on Nana, you know. She doesn't seem very impressionable. She spoke very fondly of you. More than fondly, even. Really? I did not say anything to inspire such affection. Her unfamiliarity with indifference will have made yours seem all the more seductive. She's a very attractive lady. A body without a soul. Maybe she's looking for one. She is very amusing. Yes, really. She certainly finds you very attractive. Will you be at the opening this afternoon? Definitely not. I have to be there. Work comes first. -Goodbye, my dear fellow. -Goodbye. Young lady, please have this basket sent to the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des VariÃ©tÃ©s. To Miss Nana. -Do you know her address? -Yes, 57 Rue des Martyrs, Sir. Then have it sent to her home. -For Miss Nana. -That's here. Thank you. Flowers! Your mistress won't be paying me with flowers. I told you, you'll get paid. But when? Winter's over. She doesn't need coal. If you can't afford steak, then you should eat dry bread. I don't give away free bread. I can't afford to feed whores. Have you finished. My lady needs money too, if only to pay you and she doesn't scream like that. Do you want money? -Yes. -That's all we're asking. -Then you'll get paid. -Miracles happen! On one condition. You give me 25%, plus my usual 10%, of course. You must be joking. You can always increase the bill. I'm an honest man. Make an effort, please. Or you can wait till Wednesday. The Wednesday in a week of Thursdays. -Good morning, Mrs. Tricon. -Good morning, Mrs. ZoÃ©. -Is your mistress in? -For you, always. I need to see her, right away. Here's your commission. Thank you. Don't forget, you owe me 3 louis from last time. That's right. Accounts should be kept. I hate debts. Excuse me. Just a moment. You needn't stay. You won't be paid before Wednesday. All right. But if on Wednesday... I can only give you my mistress's word. Off you go, in your best interests. Be reasonable. -Can I count on you? -You'll be paid on Wednesday. -Wednesday morning. -Wednesday morning. -Early? -Early. I've done everything I can. Come, Mrs. Tricon. -Aren't you going to leave? -Not without my money. As you wish. Mrs. Tricon, could you open the door? I'll announce you. Mrs. Tricon is here. Tell her to come back. I want to sleep some more. Sleep! What do you want to sleep for? How are you going to pay for the coal, carriage and laundry? They made quite a scene. And the butcher still won't go. Didn't you tell them I have no money? -Yes. -So? What else do they want? That won't do for them. Creditors are extraordinary. When you want to pay they say: "No, no, I can wait." But when you're broke, they want it, right now. That's how it is. At last! The prince of Sardinia. It was just delivered. Not even a trinket! Count Muffat. Muffat, Muffat. Oh, yes, Muffat. What a gentleman! I spill champagne on him and he apologizes with flowers. -Let Mrs. Tricon in. -All right. Come in, Mrs. Tricon. She's through there. Hello, Nana. Are you ready? I just got up. She came home at 9 a.m. A lot of good it did me! That wop! Please, he's the prince of Sardinia. I don't care. I brought you something that will help you out. I've got someone for you. He's waiting, at home. -Someone good? -25 louis. Who? A man of the world. The Duc de Vandeuvres. ChÃ¢teaux, racing stables, sailing boats, ancestors. He's very nice. A little fanciful, with childish whims. He wants to be introduced to a country widow of good breeding. -Inconsolable. -Right, after the night that I had. ZoÃ©, get out my black dress. -You've been charming. -I've tried to forget my grief. I hear you're leaving tonight. Yes, with my mother. We're going back to our little manor. In the neighborhood of ChÃ¢teauroux. To live there or elsewhere. Maybe you'll remarry one day. Never! I want to stay faithful to my husband's memory. -But still... -No, it's different with you. And I was still thinking of him. With no shame. I know he understands and forgives me. He was so intelligent. Thank you for the delicacy and tact that you've shown. Farewell, Sir. Forget about me. See you soon, Nana. That's right. I applauded you at the theater. I found you adorable. Not as adorable as you were here, but adorable. Couldn't you have said? -What must you think of me? -That you're a good actress. Though your presence here surprises me. Do you need money? I don't, but my creditors do. You're the Duc de Vandeuvres, aren't you? -Nobility never lies. -That makes me feel better. I like to know who I'm dealing with. -For your creditors. -Thank you. And allow me to add this, for you. She thanks you. Do you intend to stay here till Christmas? I'm in no hurry. I'm going to take a nap. Wake me when the money's here. You're lucky my mistress owes you money. Miss Nana. -Whom shall I announce? -Count Muffat. Oh, Count, please come in. Come in, Count. The lady will return soon. Then I'd rather come back. No, please, the lady would be sorry to miss you. I didn't announce my visit. I don't want to impose. What an idea. You're not imposing. On the contrary. You sent her such beautiful flowers. Yes, maybe she'll assume I came expecting thanks. She must be used to flowers of greater beauty. Yours were all the more appreciated as they were unexpected. Please, have a seat. Will you excuse me, Sir? Ah, hello. Your stairs are steep. It's a bit much, for 33 francs and 20 centimes. I hope your mistress is here. I've called six times. She's never home. You said I'd be paid today. My mistress is out. She won't be back before midnight. Count Muffat! Count Muffat! What a nice surprise! Please come up, come up. Are you leaving? I bet you were told I wasn't here. I almost missed you. I'd have been inconsolable. I intended to come back. It was so nice of you to send me those flowers! It was nothing. They were a pleasure to wake up to. I thought you'd be in. I went to bed early, after leaving the prince. Why did you leave so hastily last night? You were missed. Especially by me. Please, come in. You met my mistress. I told you she was on her way. -Did Mr. Maillochon bring his bill? -Yes. Perfect. Give him this. Tell him not to wait so long next time. This way, please. My drawing room is a mess. It's not finished yet. And the bed hasn't been made. I have to watch everything. -Are you in mourning? -Yes, my cousin. She was 25. Her chest. The funeral was today. I was her only relative. Hence my sadness last night. I wasn't myself. I hope you don't mind if I take this off. Please, sit down. I'm sorry to intrude on your sorrow. Not at all. On the contrary. I wasn't looking forward to being alone. Ah, I mustn't forget the purpose of my visit. Oh, thank you. This is too much. What is it? -Your handkerchief. -My handkerchief? Yes, you lent it to me. You should've kept it, to remember me. That would be compromising. -Why? Are you married? -With a grown-up daughter. Already. You look younger. But you're still nice. I can't imagine I have much to offer to a woman such as you. Why not? On the contrary. What do you think of me? What a question. Tell me. Don't you like me? Would I have come? Does that mean you like me? I am very happy to have met you. So am I. I feel safe with you. I wouldn't have received you in my bedroom otherwise. I trust you. I feel that if something were to happen between us, I could count on your discretion and respect, couldn't I? -Of course. -So, we're friends. -I'd like that. -Then let's kiss. -What is it now? -Oh, I'm so sorry. I always arrive at the right time. Do you know Count Muffat? Marguerite Bellanger. -The emperor's chamberlain. -I know. You were meant to meet. You must have heard of Marguerite. She's the emperor's mistress. You have the same boss. That's true. He calls me Margot. And I call him Napo. Miss Nana, it was a pleasure to spend this time with you. -Already? -I must go. Duty calls. Just ignore it. Give Napo a hug from me. That's a charming task, but wholly inappropriate to my relations with the emperor. It's such a shame she's here. Come to see me at the VariÃ©tÃ©s. -Do you promise? -I promise. See you soon. Come in. -Has Miss Nana left already? -Yes, about 10 minutes ago, Sir. -Do you know where she went? -She didn't say. Excuse me. Leave her a note. Her underwear is nice. And you don't know where she went? -I don't remember. -Really? I think she must be dining at La Maison DorÃ©e. -Are you sure? -Yes, she had yet to dine. -Was she alone? -She was when she left. Thank you. Thanks for exercising your memory. That's my job, Sir. PRIVATE ROOMS My dear lady, as a businessman, I ask you to consider love as a product, subject to supply and demand. And I'm going to make you a business proposition. You're a businessman and I like money. That works. Since we agree on that, can we negotiate? I broke with Rose Mignon. -Not because of me. -No, because of her. Good. She was a bore. I spoke with her husband. Here's the receipt. -To settle all outstanding accounts. -Perfect. A question... Bordenave and you? Just once, after we signed the contract. And a Sunday, after the matinee. It was raining. And what about Fauchery? Yes or no? He owes me an article. And Fontan? Is this an audit? I like things to be clear. Fontan? Nothing but friends for the last three months. -Gramont-Caderousse? -Gone. Don't be upset. I need to know the conditions, to adopt an appropriate position. Personally, I'm not demanding. I'll be your lover, if we can reach an agreement. But promise never to be jealous and to trust me whatever happens. And I'll be under no obligations. I'll always tell the truth, but I won't be seen with you. You only want to involve me in a part of your life. One, ten or twenty parts. Whatever you like. Except one. That's a deal. You won't regret it. Are you really as rich as they say? The Comptoir Imperial de Credit has never been so rich. I have more clients than you ever will. So, what's your answer? Yes. Let's not be so formal. So, that's a deal then. Come in. Now, let's talk love. -The bill. -It's being prepared, Sir. Bring it quickly. The bill for number 7! Excuse me, is Miss Nana here? I couldn't tell you. I haven't seen her. Excuse me, have you seen Miss Nana? No, sir, she didn't come. Thank you. Where shall we go? The Chateau des Fleurs? Valentino's? Mabille's? The Comptoir Imperial de Credit. The Comptoir Imperial de Credit. Have you lost your mind? You're not going to refuse my first wish. Banks aren't much fun. A bank is a dream setting for lovers like us. Where's the vault? Don't be in such a hurry. Let me turn on the light. So this is where you make people's money. Yes, it is. My board of directors. That's Vandeuvres on your left! What's he doing there? He lends me his name. Is he that rich? He can afford another six years, in grand style. Races, gambling, parties and other flights of fancy. -What about women? -Women? No. Gambling would be more likely to ruin him. It'd be more satisfying to be ruined in bed, don't you think? Especially when bed is a vicious circle. Come on. Look at this. Look. Oh my goodness. Where did you get all that money? I didn't get it. It was brought to me. One, two, three. Not so fast. Be beautiful, first. Be beautiful. Come on, Nana. Be beautiful. -Come on, Nana! -Give it to me. Be beautiful. Steiner! That's enough playing, Steiner. I'll help myself. I won't ask you to be beautiful. Oh, Nana. I don't mind being pretty now. Since we're here, let's take the opportunity. All right, at that price. Let's shut up shop and make love. No, not that one. Take that up to my bedroom. Yes, Madame. -This one too? -Yes, that one too. All right. Be careful, it's fragile. -Good morning, ZoÃ©. -Good morning, Fauchery. Mr. Steiner does things properly. Yes, he's very nice and very generous. That's his age. -Is your mistress here? -Yes, Sir, in her room. -Busy? -Not right now. May I come in? -Hello, Nana. -Hello. Congratulations. One could live here. Yes. -May we take... -Yes, take it. I've been so bored in that bed. -So, what brings you here? -Patience. I'll tell you, but let me explore the place first. -It's better than before, isn't it? -No comparison. -Is Muffat sending you flowers now? -Why not? -Did you see each other again? -Naturally. -Often? -Several times. -Where? -In my dressing room at the theater. He was just visiting. Nothing more. I think he loves me. That's completely absurd! You've become very uncouth! Why shouldn't he love me? He's never been in love with anyone. All the more reason. So, do you know him well? I pride myself in saying so, but who knows? -Does he have great wealth? -Yes, vast. Oh, I'm glad to hear that. I'm happy for him. I'm seeing him tonight and... And? Go on. No, I'll tell you how things went tomorrow. Nothing will happen. VÃ©not will intervene in time. -VÃ©not? Who's VÃ©not? -His spiritual director. He has a spiritual director? Yes, a former lawyer, who specialized in religious trials. Half Tartuffe, half priest. -And does Muffat obey him? -Unquestioningly. I don't care. I like Muffat the way he is. -Have you been touched by grace? -You fool! -And what's his wife like? -Not bad. -Are you courting her? -Yes. -Are you in love? -No, I just desire her. -Why? -Because she looks like a saint. And if I ever get what I want, the ring that you liked, which we saw at Laumonier's... With the diamond and rubies? Yes. If I get what I want, that ring is yours, I swear. Oh, thank you. Let's talk seriously. Did you see today's SiÃ¨cle? Why? Well you should. I devoted two columns to you. No! How can I thank you? As agreed. Nothing could be simpler. -Wait, I need to know how much I owe. -I'll return the change. "Nana". That's a good start. Is something wrong? "A poem with silk and feathers." -Isn't that pretty? -It's all right. "And her wicked charm." Wicked. What about my mind? You don't mention it. I'm interested in your body. What do I need with your mind? My own is enough. -What about my talent? -Your talent? You're about to show me that. You rogue. What prostitutes you are, you journalists. OK. But I'm only doing this to be nice to you. And because I'm paying my debts today. -Hey, Nana! -What? Thanks for Steiner. You took him off my hands. Bordenave? Do what you have to do, but I don't want Steiner in my dressing room tonight. -It depends who the beneficiary is. -Muffat. That's serious. You can count on me. Thank you, Bordenave. Ah, are you here already? -Hello. -Hello. How nice to see you again. -Did you think about me? -I haven't stopped. -But despite that... -Yes? No day has seemed longer. Maybe the thought of me made you sad. Hortense, help me get dressed. So, have you organized things? Your wife? My wife is in Montmorency for a week. You manage well for a chamberlain. Diplomacy is one of my attributes. You don't regret coming here? Why do you ask that? No remorse? What does that mean? Your conscience isn't bothering you? If I came to see you, in spite of my conscience, it means that my feelings overpowered it. Good. Make the most of it. Hortense, you can go. We won't need you. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, Sir. -Goodbye, Madame. Where shall we sup? The CafÃ© Anglais, the Valderre, the Maison Doree? I've chosen a nice place where we'll have some privacy. -Will you let me take you there? -Lead on. Will you pass my coat, please? Where are we going? My house isn't set up yet, but it'll be like home. I'm ready. Shall we go? Yes. Is it far? No, it's a stone's throw. Have a seat. Come in. Good evening. Where should we put the table? -Just by the gentleman. -Very good. I ordered supper at Marguery's. I organized everything. I'm also something of a chamberlain. Since we've arrived, help me take off my coat. So, what do you think of my restaurant? It's charming. I won't share its address with any of my friends. Just a moment. May I? It's a selection of fruits, Mr. Fontan. I can see. -Grapes. -Grapes. -Figs. -Yes. Pears. -Of you go. -Very good, Sir. Fontan, are you coming to supper, at the CafÃ© Riche? No, I don't think so. -You can join us later. -Of course. Hey, Rose! I'm coming to supper with you. -It's your treat, isn't it? -Obviously. Gentlemen. You're the nicest girl in the world. In the world? Let's say on Boulevard Montmartre. I had hoped this night would never end. And it's day already. We can stay in bed during the day. Paris looks so fine, for an old city. Yes, not like Rose Mignon. Look, goats! You know what would be nice? You're not tired and nor am I. Take me for a glass of milk at the Bois de Boulogne dairy. -As you like. -Let's take a cab. Coachman! To the Bois de Boulogne dairy. -Will you take me anywhere? -Anywhere. -Still no regrets? -Why do you ask? If you can't answer, kiss me. Even after staying up all night, milk makes me feel so pure. How do you feel? Don't laugh at what I am going to say, Nana, but I didn't exist until I met you. A chamberlain takes up a lot of space. Yes, a lot of space, in a large void. You stopped me from wasting the rest of my life. You did. I wasn't really living, Nana. I was just acting, strutting my vanity on a stage. I sacrificed everything to my title and to honors, which only matter if you believe in them. This morning, I'm not so sure that I do. Your mouth, your laugh, your skin, your hair in my hand... That's the truth, Nana. The rest... For a man that can't talk to women! Am I boring you? I know I am. Not at all, my dear Muffat. On the contrary. So many people court you and compliment you. Of course, but you know how that is. Most men only think about one thing. They want to know the price. They only think about themselves. They're selfish. You seem to think about me and your feelings seem true. That means something. I beg you, Nana, never mention other men again. Would you like that? Then there are no others. They're over. Really? Is it just the two of us? You are so young for your age. Yes, I'd like that. All I want is to love you. Be careful, Nana. All I want is to believe you. I love you, Nana. I feel so good near you. What's stopping you from staying? -My dear Nana. -Oh, Vandeuvres! How nice to see you again. It's been so long. The Duc de Vandeuvres. Count Muffat. How is your charming friend, whose house I met you in? -I rarely see her. -I thought you were close. -She is such a charming woman! -Charming, yes. -And so understanding. -Who is this? The Marquise de Triconie. You must know her. I haven't had the pleasure. How strange. She's so well connected. Let me introduce Tourangelles. He beat Vermouth last Sunday at an epic race, attended by the King of Prussia. I'm sure you'll be at the Tuileries, for the reception in his honor. Certainly not, Sir. My feelings toward the empire forbid me to honor the son of Madame Hortense and Citizen Louis Bonaparte. I'm sorry for them, Sir. Then I'm sure they'll be glad not to have invited you. See you soon, my most beautiful lady. I hope you'll visit my stables. I'd love to. -He's so entertaining, isn't he? -A stable hand. -Sir? -Ah, VÃ©not. I waited for you all night. I kept hoping that you wouldn't go there. But you succumbed. Yes, that's right. What I don't know, God helps me to guess. What do you want? I want to save those at risk, as you are, Count. That evil woman will be your downfall. She'll ruin you within three months, unless you resist her. -Think of your salvation. -You're a poor prophet, VÃ©not. Look at me. You see before you a happy man, with no regrets. Oh, Lord, take pity on him. I am the queen of the city. Every night, we have lots of fun. Among all the dancers on stage, I choose a new lover. Take the fools' money. Make them jump! Make them jump! The Hidalgos and fat cats. Make them jump! Fireworks! Diamonds, hearts and louis. Make them jump! Make them jump! And when we get to bed... Make them jump! Make them jump! And when we get to bed... Make them jump! Make them jump! People watch me through their glasses, when I kick up my feet. All those mills and money that gayly ground down my virtue. Take the fools' money. Make them jump! Make them jump! Hidalgos and fat cats. Make them jump! Fireworks! Diamonds, hearts and louis. Make them jump! Make them jump! And when we get to bed... Make them jump! Make them jump! And when we get to bed... Make them jump! Make them jump! Are you leaving already, Madame? The show's not over. I know. I've seen what I wanted to see. Hello, Mr. Broux. It's 10:30. Hello, Count. -Hello, Mr. Muffat -Hello, my dear. Paulette! Did you see a doctor? Yes, I'm going to have a little girl. What if your little girl is a boy? -Hello, Mr. Muffat. -Hello, my dear. Do you know who the father is? No, but once he's born, I'll see who he looks like. And you'll say: "I've seen that face somewhere before." Hidalgos and fat cats. Make them jump! Fireworks! Diamonds, hearts and louis. Make them jump! Make them jump! And when we get to bed... Make them jump! Make them jump! And when we get to bed... Make them jump! Make them jump! -How are you tonight? -Very well, thank you. Your cigars are amazing. Where do you get them? At the store. A bought cigar is never as good as a cigars given as a gift. -How would you know? -Fontan, you're on. See you later. Quick, quick. Hello Muffat. Did you hear? The news is that Steiner is in trouble. They say he lost his money in the crash. He'll bounce back. Trouble for him means trouble for me and I'm not the only one. -Did you invest with him? -No, but he invested with me. Some business in phosphate has brought him down. One should always treat patrons with caution. Hello. The audience is good tonight. -Come and help me change. -Of course. -If you hear anything... -I'll let you know. -What does he want to know about? -Nothing important. Steiner is bankrupt. -What's that about Steiner? -He's bankrupt. -Are you sure? -What do you care? What do I care? I thought he was smarter, that's all. He played and he lost. And he deserved it. This isn't a joke! What if Bordenave has to close down? Hey, Nana! Bordenave says Steiner's gone bankrupt. Is that true? Why are you asking me? Because I put all my money in phosphate. On his advice! Don't you know anything about it? What do you expect me to know? All my savings! Ten years of success! -Haven't you heard anything? -I said no, dammit! Why is he asking me? You're so tense. I'm thinking about all the people that'll be ruined, like Fontan. What's this about a crash? It's nothing out of the ordinary. Algerian phosphates have crashed. That's awful. The word "crash" was created for us to labor under a necessity, like governments, holy wars and cholera. -A crash. -Yes. If I've got this right, you're running away. No, I am taking the train to a foreign capital. But I won't just let you go. Do you plan to pay for my upkeep? I don't have any money. What did you do with yours? Where did your millions go? From my hands to yours. You're a money pit, Nana. A money pit? Who do you think I am? Don't make a scene over ruining me. How did I do that? You changed your furnishings four times. Can new furniture cause phosphate to crash? And upholstery and paintings are expensive. Dresses from Wort's are expensive. Shoes from Esterne are expensive. And jewelry from Laumonier is very expensive. So is gambling. A lot of gambling takes place in your house, Nana. And a lot of people come to you for money. Your generosity weighed heavily on my wallet. But my wealth and that of others not being enough, you cheated on me for a week with a rich Brazilian, long enough to bleed him dry and to send him home under ambassadorial escort. But I'm not bitter. Here. This should tide you over. Ah, you're the best! You will come back, won't you? -I give you my word. -That means you won't. My personal word of honor. Ah! There you are! Hello, Madame. Is this why I lent you my name, a name untarnished for a centuries? That's fine - I'm giving it back. It's all yours. -In what condition? -It's been perfectly preserved. -It hasn't been compromised. -It has, in my own eyes. I don't want my picture hanging there. In this abattoir. Help him out of his frame, Nana. Yes. Hold the chair, please. Bankrupt! Where did all this money go? Into what pit? It's unimaginable. Where did he go? Where did he go? He had to catch a train. Good riddance. Now he's gone, we can cover up the scandal. He was dealing with the Tuileries scoundrels. -Hoodlums. -I couldn't speak badly of him. Is that to light the fire or for wrapping? -Are these worthless? -Come on, Nana! I should have known! Come on. No, not that way. Let's go through here. I'm happy that this bankruptcy reunited us. -Are you still seeing that dour fool? -I like Count Muffat. Then I withdraw the word "dour." And Steiner's departure won't leave you short? It will. I have nothing but debts. Muffat's wealth should take care of them. I've never asked him for anything. -Is that a joke? -No, he's so innocent. He never thought to give money. -What does he think you live on? -My art. -You mean your acting? -Yes, that's right. -And did he tolerate Steiner? -No, he knew nothing about him. He'd never have accepted it. -Is he jealous? -Like a tiger. He must be tamed and caged. Nana, he should prove his love, with his fortune. He's unaware of the conventions. I'm his first mistress. Then take advantage of it. Teach him how to live. And as you like him, don't treat him as a beggar by giving yourself freely. I told you, my mistress slept here. No, no, no, ZoÃ©. Where did she spend the night? I want the truth, do you hear? The truth. The truth? So be it. She came home, exhausted, from looking for Steiner. As soon as she got up, she ran to Steiner's bank. Did she deposit there? No. But she often withdrew there. Yes, Sir. The couch that you were sitting on was paid for by Steiner. The carpet that you're standing on was paid for by Steiner. The bed that you sleep in was paid for by Steiner. Your morning coffee was paid for by Steiner, as were the cups you drink from and the lady with whom you drink it. Steiner paid for everything here, except you. There. Are you happy now? Get out. Get out, now. It would've been someone else, if not Steiner. Hello, ZoÃ©. I told him all about Steiner. You would have found out one day. So... You have nothing to fear now. He's gone. But he has left a vacuum. I really have no luck. No luck? That's a good one! What about me? What do I say? No luck! Is that your defense? I loved you truly for months, while you were putting on an act. I took care of you. What delicacy! Men are such brutes. Do you expect me to console you now that swindler is gone? Should I beg forgiveness that you were his mistress? Whether he stays or goes, what's the difference? You cheated on me with Steiner. Steiner! Don't you cheat on your wife? I cheated on him with you, not the reverse. I knew him before I met you! I need to change. I can't argue with this on my head. Come on. Mr. Steiner used to live here. I suppose he has a successor. No, the place is all yours. How could you take money from that contemptible man? Don't you keep your wife? That's not the same thing. A husband is bound to keep his wife. The Countess Muffat had her own wealth and she's faithful. Give me wealth and provide for me and I'll be faithful too! How dare you ask me to account for myself! Did you ever ask how I support myself? You're looking at it, from my head to my toes. You've certainly benefited. If you'd really loved me... If I had loved you? If I didn't still love you, I wouldn't be here. All I reproach you for is your lack of trust. Am I not your friend? Why didn't you tell me that you needed money? You're intimidating. And I'm nice. From now on, your money troubles are over. There'll be no more Steiners in your life. Promise? That depends on you. You see? There was no need to fight, when we love each other as we do. OK, I forgive you. Give me a kiss. Ah, you forgive me, after what you've done? You really don't bear grudges. Your Majesty, let me introduce my daughter, Estelle. How charming. We'll be pleased to see her at the Tuileries. What more fitting company for the CompiÃ¨gnes festivities? Excellent idea. What does her fiancÃ© say? The future husband's pride could only be flattered, Sir. That's a fine answer. I hope you make your wife very happy, Philippe. Your father-in-law will teach you how. Would you both open the ball for us? Let us admire the brilliant couple you make. What's the matter, Muffat? You no longer attend the empress's Tuesdays. Have you found less official attractions elsewhere? Maturity has to pass. Your wife is waiting. Dance with her a little. It will be an opportunity to be close to you for a while. -Our daughter is almost married. -As befits her age. Soon it will be just the two of us again, as it was when I was 18. We haven't aged. Never have 18 years seemed such a short time. If you think that sincerely, then thank you. Isn't this waltz going to your head? I'll go anywhere. You can plan our honeymoon. Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Norway. I don't need a change of scenery to be happy with you. Why don't we go on a second honeymoon? Let's go away, to the countryside. We'd have a chance to take stock and reconnect. We'd come back rejuvenated. I'll go wherever you like, Sabine. Would you spend a whole season, alone with me? A whole season? Sabine, I married you for life. Indulge me tonight. I've organized supper for us, at home. Let's go home early. I am sorry, but that won't be possible tonight. -Do you have an appointment? -Yes, an important appointment. -If you had told me earlier... -No, it would have been too late. Why? Pick another evening. No, no, I apologize. Let's not discuss it again, ever. Hello, Fauchery. Curtain. -Hello. -Hello. -Ah, Fauchery! -Hello, Nana. Come here. What do you want? -Give me your hand, Nana. -My hand? Give me your hand. -No! -Yes. -When did it happen? -This afternoon. -Do I keep my word? -It took three months. That only adds to my victory. -What do you say? -I dislike cuckolds. That word is enough. Say no more. Goodbye, Nana. You're a sweetheart. Fauchery, thanks for the ring. I gave her the same. Vandeuvres, what a nice surprise! Were you watching? In the third row. -I'm going to Scotland on Thursday. -You must tell me all about it. I have all night. Nana's in company. So, you are going to Scotland. What for? To visit stud farms, buy horses and pick the Grand Prix winner. So I hope. -Will you be away long? -Who knows? It was nice to say goodbye. It was nice of you to agree to sup with me. Ah, did I agree to have supper with you? Would you deny me that final pleasure? Indeed, I would not. And how is Muffat? Did you follow my advice? He accepted my conditions. I feel much freer with things as they are now. Ah, there you are! You've already met. I won't introduce you. There's no need. My meeting with the emperor has been postponed. My evening is yours. I'm so sorry, I'm to sup with Vandeuvres. And I can't possibly ask you to join us. I told you I might be free tonight. Yes, but Mr. Vandeuvres is leaving for Scotland. A charming country, but I fail to see the relevance. Please, Nana, get dressed. This is indecent. I have nothing to hide. I go on stage like this. Haven't you seen me naked? You are difficult. Beauty is never indecent. No, but it may become so by the gaze that it attracts. -Close your eyes. -I'm not talking about me. Then you mean me. Nana's beauty belongs to everyone, like the sun. -Don't leave us in the dark. -He's right. You dim my light. Is it my fault that I'm attractive? That's why you're here. It's true. I'm not a nun, after all. -Five minutes! -Yes, the interval's over. -Shall I wait here? -No, Nana will sup with me. One would have to be very hungry. Mr. Vandeuvres, withdraw that remark at once! If the Jockey Club accepted counts dating back to Waterloo, you'd know I never withdraw a stake. I see you're at home in the stables. Oh, boys, calm down. You'll end up falling out, at this rate. Nana, I never quarrel with lackeys. But I do. You could have warned me! -I'll expect your seconds. -You'll see them in the morning. We'll meet before I leave. Name the time. I'll be there to wish you "bon voyage." See you later, Nana. Oh! You're going to fight for me. Be careful not to kill him, darling. I don't want him on my conscience. Don't worry, I just want to break him of the habit of getting in my way. -And we'll still be together? -Of course, life goes on. Are you ready? Fight, gentlemen. In the name of the emperor, stop! The emperor? Show me the order that he signed. Here is a letter, from His Majesty. We're merely here to enforce his orders. Gentlemen, my train leaves in an hour. On guard, Sir! Count, be reasonable. Let's not cause a scandal. We'll meet again, Sir. -Nana, Nana. -Yes? It's you. Already? Come and give me a kiss. I was so worried. So, tell me what happened. Poor Vandeuvres. But he was asking for it. Go ahead. I'm listening. What's wrong? You look so pale. Did you kill him? What else could you do? No, the duel didn't take place. I was kept from fighting. By whom? The emperor. The police intervened. -And you obeyed? -I tried to refuse, but in vain. They didn't want you to fight for me. That's why. Your excuse for an emperor sees me as no more than a harlot. What's going on in Marguerite's bed? A coup d'Ã©tat? What a world you live in! Calm down. You're talking nonsense. You're behaving like some sort of upstart. You storm my room, you insult a real duke, who descends from the Crusades, and then you wake me up to tell me that a tiny little sword scared you into calling the police! What an empire this is! How could you suggest that I fled a duel that I called myself? It's absurd. What will I look like tonight? Did I ask you to fight a duel? Coward! Chicken! A girl of your standing may not question my honor. Your honor! What honor? That's a fine type of honor! -You're a second-ranker. -Nana! Why not beat me, while you're at it? Vandeuvres is right. You despise me. -What's wrong with you? -Apologize. You're hurting me! Apologize, right now. I'm sorry. Goodbye, Nana. Goodbye, Nana? Good ahead! Insult me! You snake! You dirty snake! What a thing to do to me, in my home, at 8 a.m. Madame, what's going on? Count Muffat didn't look happy. Were you acting foolishly? On the contrary. I kicked him out. I'm fed up of being treated like a whore. If you start getting sensitive... He can't even control his own wife. Those high-minded people are good! When you give them what they want, they take advantage of you. The upholsterer is here, with his bill. Money, always money! I don't have any. They'll have to manage. I'll prove that I can have a lover without being paid. I'm sentimental too, for God's sake! I need air, freedom. I'm going to take advantage of the theater's closure. Madame, you're making me feel bad. You were doing so well. Close up the shop. I'm off. Where will you go? Where? Anywhere. I used to live with Fontan. I'll go back to live with him. You can't be serious. He's a selfish miser. Yes, he's a miser. He loves me for me, not for his money. So, did you get what you were looking for? -Whiting. -Whiting? That's luxury fish. Here's the newspaper. Remember my shirt button. I'll do it after I've cooked lunch. They're talking about you. "Lost item: "A work of art called Nana, "noted at the theater, for her pleasing physiognomy "and her shrill voice. "The return of this item will be rewarded by Count Muffat." They can mind their own business. They don't know what really happened. I'm so glad I walked away. Bordenave helped me a lot when he closed that place. He needs to start rehearsing a new play though. So long as there's a part for you. Authors aren't so crazy. Do you love me? Yes, I love you like a chamberlain. I was only made for love. -Don't you have any regrets? -Yes - lost time. And your carriage, your house and your servants? My only luxury is love. So, you're happy. Yes, very happy. What about you? Are you happy? Yes, I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. By the way, how much was the whiting? I don't know. Hang on... Six francs, in total. Six francs? Six francs for one dinner! You can get so moody. Six francs for a dinner like that? Who do you think l am? I'm not a chamberlain! You really don't know where she is? If only I did. With relative maybe, in the countryside. -Doesn't she write? -Never. Come come, ZoÃ©. -Don't you believe me? -No, ZoÃ©. You're wrong. This proves it. Every day, Vandeuvres sends flowers, from Scotland. I resell them to a different florist. That's my daily bread. You have to find her. She has to come back. For her creditors to prey on her. You don't know her. As honest as she is! Her debts will be paid. I'll take care of everything. Why did she run away? Why? The grief from having left you after that misunderstanding. She's too proud to try to get you back. If I hear from her... You never know. Contact me, immediately. Here. That'll cover the costs. Oh, Count. Find her and I'll reward you handsomely. I'll start the hunt today. You're both so nice to me. COUNT, AS YOU ASKED, I IMMEDIATELY STARTED LOOKING FOR NANA. I may have a lead, but I need 1,000 francs to start investigating. Hello, Sabine. A letter was delivered for you. Thank you. Is it important? No, a minor request for help. Why are you lying? This ZoÃ©, who wants 1,000 francs to conduct an investigation is of the utmost importance. Do you read my letters now? I have good reason to be suspicious. But this discussion is pointless. I'm leaving you. Sabine, you don't know what you're saying. Look, I'm perfectly calm. I hold nothing against you. I'm leaving, that's all. I'll leave you to your pleasures. You'll be happier without me. Sabine, listen. I beg you, listen. What's the use? You have to admit, I've been quite patient. But patience is not resignation. I bear you no grudge. I'm making way for you. It would be best if you agreed to a separation of our assets. That way, I can protect my fortune and you'll be free to waste yours. I understand your contempt, Sabine. I judge myself harshly, believe me. But I beg you to reflect, before taking such a serious decision. I was devoted to you for 20 years. I am told that I am still pretty. Why would I sacrifice what's left of my youth to a love that's gone? But I still love you, Sabine. I still love you. You'd better send that woman the 1,000 francs she is asking for. It's impossible. You can't be saying this. Sabine, look at me! Look at me. I will never see this girl again. Never, do you hear? Never. I swear on my life, I'll never see her again. I am happy that you read that letter. I am delivered now. If I had been able to talk to you, everything could have worked out. If you knew. If you only knew. Now it's over. You must help me. You will help, won't you? Speak, Sabine. How I pity you. Stay. Stay. Don't go. Don't abandon me. You have no right to leave. We're not alone in this, Sabine. Very well. I'll stay. We'll see what your word is worth. I don't want any dead weight! Get to it! Get that cleared up! Fast! What did I do? You're annoying me, you're irritating me, you're bothering me! Out! No, I won't go. I won't go. Ah, you won't go. We'll see about that. Let go of me! You're hurting me! Let go! There we go! Good night! Sleep wherever you like! Those are my pants! Fontan! Go to hell! Police! Don't stay here! -Bunch of whores! -We'll get you! Arrest them all! What are you doing there? You're coming with us! Let's go! You shut your mouth! Don't you know who l am? No, we don't, you slut. I'm Count Muffat's mistress. You're making a big mistake! I said shut up! -I'm telling you, I am... -That's enough! Come on! POLICE STATION Let's get these whores over to St. Lazare prison. The redhead too? No, next time. I need to check her references. That's everyone. Let's go! Let's go! Believe me, Count Muffat, no one regrets this as much as I do myself. We didn't know who she was. Never hit any woman. I'm surprised at your conception of your own work. Your officers have behaved illegally and you will be held responsible. I regret the misunderstanding, please believe me. I regret it too, Commissioner, on your behalf. Let's go. I told you so. To the Grand Hotel. You're nice. No, I simply put my powers in the service of my weakness. You are nice. I always knew. You know, when you're unhappy. You think of those you love. You were so happy for four months that you forgot me. I didn't dare to write to you. If only you knew. -Imagine... -Don't say a word. I don't want to know. You may feel the need to lie. I don't have the heart to lie. My dear Muffat. SALE OF PRIVATE MANSION A gentleman is awaiting you, Madame. What are you doing here? Polite people say "hello." What a welcome! Hello. -Were you waiting long? -Four months. I decided to make the first step. This is nice. You denied yourself nothing. -Muffat's quite a man! -Isn't it nice? -It must have cost a fortune! -A few million. And there's more. Come on. It seems I bring my staff luck! Your women are lucky when they leave you. Where did you meet Muffat, you goose? That's true. You honeymooned at my place. I even gave you a fine. Let's not get nostalgic. What are you up to? We never see you. -Muffat prefers me to stay away. -Did he introduce his friends? Were you received as the empress's honorary cousin? You're upsetting me. Why bury yourself away so young? What will you do when you're dead? This is like the Arabian Nights. Muffat paid up front, without counting the cost. Of course... when you see this... What? In Paris, they're saying that you made such a dent in Muffat's fortune that he had to sell his land and he's about to mortgage his house. You know what people say. My mansion and jewelry are paid for, as is my coachman. Then everything's fine and dandy. Let's talk about why I'm here. I have a stunning play, with a great part for Nana. Impossible. Muffat won't have me in the theater. What are you doing here? The theater for me now... You ingrate. You owe the theater everything. On the subject, someone wants to see you. He's there every night. -Who? -Vandeuvres. Oh, him. Since he came back, we've turned him away four times. He writes to me every day. I don't even open his letters now. You should. If you accept to do this play, we could come to some of deal. How do you mean? Muffat could back the play and I'd become Paris's most prestigious director. I'd cover you with gold, with his backing. What backing? If I ruined him, how can he give you money? Just ask him. You'll know where you stand. That's a good idea. I'll do it. There's a man here for Mr. Bordenave. I know him. Let him in. -Oh, no. -Yes. It's someone with a bright future and an important message for you. You'll thank me. -Here he is! -You've got a lot of nerve! I hope you'll still read my script. A great part, music by Offenbach, words by Megatier, directed by Bordenave! Paris will be ours! I remember you. You're too kind, thank you. My trip went very well. My, you're pretty. Scotland is beautiful. There's the famous fog. Very pretty. Local thriftiness, great whisky. I really like you. I brought back a beautiful filly that's a little like you. She's impetuous, frisky, and impulsive. I named her Nana. She'll be racing the Grand Prix. -Finally, a smile. -Hello, Vandeuvres. Hello, Nana. -So is this where you live? -Yes. Congratulations. I didn't know you were so brave. -Why, do you find it ugly? -Hideous. This aggressive display of wealth. This ostentatious luxury. How vulgar! And that bed. How horrible. You don't belong here, Nana. This belongs to Muffat. An upstart, who wanted to mark his property, and who measures greatness by its dimensions. My poor Nana, you'll age fast and die slowly, of boredom. You'll get a nice funeral. You've become so mean. Scotland didn't agree with you, did it? Yes, it transformed me. I love you, Nana. Let's move on. Muffat reigns. I'll await his abdication. Well, that's nice. So, you love me now. It's been months. Oh, yes. You became very important to me, while I was away. My dear obsession. Let's not discuss it. It's a matter for me. Because this mansion really is the most ridiculous of its kind. I don't want to see you here. I want to see you elsewhere. In a setting worthy of you. Here, the most that I can do is to kiss your neck. Oh, Vandeuvres. Yes, I could ruin myself for you too, but tastefully. In another style. What we just did was foolish. It was nothing to do with me. But I don't regret it too much. Mr. Vandeuvres, you are in my house. Please leave. I told you, it's his house. Are you feeling braver today? Leave, at once. Do you hear me? Get out! Have you gone mad? He's a salon duelist. Hurry up, sir. Leave. Thank you for this charming welcome. I beg you Vandeuvres. Madame. You can be proud of yourself. That was clever. Are you unaware, cynical or just stupid? What harm were we doing? He just stopped by, just by chance. He stopped by, by chance at your house. -You're a poor liar. -I'd say if I was. I've done nothing wrong. -I could easily cheat on you. -I don't advise you to try! Things are going to change. Yes, they are! I'm fed up of this opulence. I'm sick of this luxury. I want my freedom. Bordenave offered me a part and I'm going to take it. If you don't like it, go back to your wife. Here, you can take Vandeuvres' letters. I didn't read them! I don't care about Vandeuvres! Are those letters even open? Calm down, Nana. I wouldn't scold you unless I loved you. Why didn't you say you were unhappy? This is your home, not mine. I should live at Nana's, just like Nana. Agreed. You'll live like Nana, seeing as you are Nana. -Can I play in the theater? -Of course you can. Acting is what Nana is about. And can I see my old friends? If they amuse you. I'm too good. You'd better make the most of it. Still, you love me in such a strange way. You're right, Nana. I loved you badly and not for who you truly are. You are Nana. Will you go to see Bordenave? -What for? -To negotiate. About what? He wants you to back his show. It'll all be above board. Always money. No, I'm sorry, that's impossible. I've just paid off 500,000 francs. What do I care, if you owed it? I owed it! But who spent it? You! Why make such a fuss over a small bill? Why make a fuss? I do not have the means to deal with Bordenave. Is that clear? My wealth is not infinite. I don't have others people's money, like Steiner. Unfortunately. What does that mean? Do you miss Steiner? Do you miss that crook? What is it? What do you want? Mr. VÃ©not wants to talk to you. -VÃ©not? Here? -Your conscience. Just on time. Just a moment. What's going on? I have bad news, Count. Countess Muffat has left. -What? -For good. I'm not a moralist, You know I hold you in high esteem. I can only repeat what you said a year ago here. Your weakness is my main concern. This girl is leading you to ruin. How can a man of your status not see that certain company is degrading? Sir, that person hosts Paris. But not vice versa. Muffat, your arguments are childish and unworthy of you. Let's take stock of this fine love affair. Your wife has left. Your wealth is gone. Your daughter is no longer engaged. The breaking of that engagement will spare my daughter much disappointment. That cad loved her dowry more than her. I hear that she's planning to enter a convent. Is that the future you dreamed of? No, Muffat. No, no. Your behavior is inexcusable You know, the opposition newspapers are having a field day with your scandalous affair. Don't force me to ask for your resignation. Think, Muffat. Remember the man you used to be. You may miss that man, Sir, but I do not. And I assure you that I have no illusions. My mansion is pretty, but I'd rather have a place like this. I'd gladly gift it to you, but this room here is the only room that I own. Everything else is mortgaged. And if you stayed here, you'd end up that way too. No! How did this happen? We are living in a fairy-tale chateau, Nana. The main gate has become that beautiful ring you're wearing. The woods where my ancestors hunted under the reign of Henri III have become a diamond necklace for Nana. The two towers and their golden spires have become bracelets for Nana. As for the rest, be patient. You all say the same thing. Wait. Always wait. Until the Grand Prix. I've put everything on Nana. If Nana wins, my wealth will be restored. And if Nana loses? Then I'll be done for, broke, cleaned out and ruined. You like to gamble. Listen to this. Go ahead. If I win, I'll take you away from Muffat. I'll take you to Venice. We'll let the empire crumble in shame, slip into the mud and sink in the mire. What if you lose? You'll never hear of me again. I'll die elegantly. And you will long remember the only gentleman that you've ever known. -Nana, Nana! -Hello. -Hello, Nana! -What a nice day! Fougerolle, my agent. Pleased to meet you. Come on, I brought champagne. -Let the party begin! -Let's have some champagne! -Hello. -Hello, Nana. -Hello, Rose. -How are you? There's the emperor. Long live the emperor! And the empress! Where's Muffat? There he is. Where's Vandeuvres? I can't see Vandeuvres. He must be in the paddock, with his trainer. He never leaves Nana. The real Nana. Just a moment. So? She's on top form. I'll lose my name if she doesn't win. OK, just be careful. Put my money on Nana at the last moment. Tell everyone that I'm betting on Huisignant. There are the odds. What about Nana? No, she never won a race in England. She's a snail, not a horse. Look at the odds. 55 to 1. I'm not worth much today. -Who's riding me? -Preeze, an Englishman. I like Englishmen! Are you betting on Nana? Are you crazy? That old mule! I bet you're happy to say that. Here's to you. -Calling a horse Nana... -It's unbelievable. At least they didn't call it Chamberlain. Excuse me, Sir. I beg your pardon, Sir. I misjudged you. I was foolish. Whatever happens, we'll never see each other again. Whatever happens? What do you mean? -How much did you put on Nana? -I never gamble. Wrong. You're betting Nana on Nana. One has to be fair to oneself. Nana and I have made a bet of sorts. A rather shabby bet. If Nana wins, I'll regain my fortune and I'll take Nana tonight. If not, I'll be gone for good. You'll stay together, with your love. Until another Vandeuvres... I thank you for your honesty, Sir. I don't deserve any recognition. I feel sorry for you. Tonight, the loser will be no luckier than the winner. We love, Sir. That is our downfall, our disgrace and our punishment. It's actually rather comical. Why Nana, when so many other girls are just as charming, just as stupid, just as desirable and probably less dangerous? We're desperate cases, Sir. Well, one good turn deserves another. If Nana leaves me to be with you, what will happen? Maybe I'll kill you. I apologize. Apologies accepted. We'll leave for Venice. -The race is starting! -Come on. May I? Yes, get in. There she is! There! I can see her. The red one. How beautiful! I'm quite frisky, don't you think? My jockey's not bad either. What a nice filly I am. You're a nice filly, but I'm not crazy. -I bet on Huisignant. -You were wrong. I'll need to watch now. Go Nana! Go! Go! -Long live Nana! -I lost my money. If you had bet on me... Long live Nana! Everybody bet on Huisignant! Listen to those fools! The more they lose, the louder they shout! Long live Nana! Nana! Nana, Nana! Dear Vandeuvres! What a feeling! I had a knot here. I almost fainted. -I tell you, if I had lost... -Don't even say that! -Are still leaving? -Yes. My suitcases are packed. -Where are you going? -To formalize things. We'll meet at 10 p.m. at the station. How much did you win? I'll tell you tonight. See you later. -Do you have a minute? -What is it? The police commissioner. It's as I thought. This horse was drugged. Mr. Vandeuvres, the vet's findings appear to be conclusive. While we wait for the investigation to conclude, we'll have to disqualify your horse. Your honor, Sir, seems quite compromised. The commission will rule on you. There's no need. I'll decide my own fate. My dear Muffat, I'm leaving you. I hesitated at length before making this decision. -The suitcases are in the carriage. -Very good. I just need to say goodbye now. But, ZoÃ©, I never intended to let you go. I'm entrusting you with the house. Sorry, but that's impossible. I bought Mrs. Tricon's business. With what money? With my savings. I hope Madame will come to visit. If I can be of service to you... I always appreciated your qualities. -I wish you good luck, ZoÃ©. -Thank you, Madame. -Goodbye, Madame. -Goodbye, ZoÃ©. Best wishes to Mr. Vandeuvres. -Is your mistress here? -Yes, in her room. -Where are you going? -To run an errand. I'll be back. Well, Nana. Ah, I was writing to you. What a strange idea. You should get ready for dinner. I made reservations at Marguery's. Hurry up. I can't have dinner. Really? Didn't you see my carriage? Didn't you notice the cases? I'm going on a trip. No, we're having dinner tonight. That's my decision. Why don't you read my letter? It just needs a signature. We'll read it together. -I'm telling you... -Don't insist. It's ridiculous. If you will force me to hurt you, so be it. I'm leaving you, Muffat. There, I've said it. I'm not leaving without regret. I really wasn't sure. I did a lot of thinking. But it'd reflect badly on me to stay. My reputation is bad enough. They say I broke your marriage, that I spent your fortune that I cheated on you and Lord knows what else. I've had enough of it. I don't want to cause problems with your wife. I wish you'd go back to her and be happy with her. You deserve it. Are you making fun of me? Look at me. I have nothing left. No wife, no daughter, no fortune. I sacrificed everything for you. You're all I have. I don't want to be yours. Thank you, but I won't let you go to Vandeuvres. You knew? Why didn't you say so? I wanted to spare you. Yes, I love Vandeuvres. Is that my fault? You should understand. I loved you when we met. Be reasonable. Let's not be angry. Let's stay friends. No, I'm going to keep you. Why are you all always trying to hang on to me? I shouldn't have to pay for your foolishness! You love me! So what? You're not the only one. If love bought my attachment, I'd never get out of bed! You're staying here with me. Let me past! Let me past! Nana! I don't love you anymore I don't love you anymore. I know you don't love me. You never loved me. You don't love anyone, Nana. Nobody. You're only going with Vandeuvres because of his win. Since you know I don't love you, let me go. It's not that easy. Unfortunately, I can't live without you. That's the way it is. I need to see you, to touch you. I'm obsessed. I can see that I'm sinking. It's horrific. I'm a witness to the costly spectacle of my own downfall. I want you to be here, Nana, when I collapse into oblivion. I want you to see me croak. I want you to stay to the end. -My darling piece of trash. -Piece of trash! What about your wife! She's no better than I am! THE END Subtitling: Hiventy
