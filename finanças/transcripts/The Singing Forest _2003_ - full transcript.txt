(lighthearted music) (puking) - Are you okay? Here. (coughing) (lighthearted music) Let me get some water for you. - Thank you. - Here, this will make you feel better. - [Woman] Christopher is a man who's aware of his surroundings. - Thank you. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - [Woman] Fate tore them apart. Destiny brought them together. (lighthearted music) - No! (dramatic music) (knocking) - Christopher? Do you ever answer your phone? - I don't want to talk to him. - You look like hell. Why aren't you ready? - I'm not going into work today, I'm not feeling well. - Yeah, this is probably why you're not feeling well, you drink too much. - Look, I only had a couple, all right? - We missed you last night. - Sorry. - You've been late with your columns. If you don't watch it, you're gonna get fired. I mean, I understand that, you know, Savannah died six months- - Will you shut up, please? Just... Just... - Sorry. - Is six months enough for you? I spent 22 years with her, 22! I miss her. I loved her so much. - I didn't mean... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make matters worse. Listen, but I was reading your last article, "The Singing Forest". Very interesting. About how searching for your soul and... Do you really think people can connect with their past lives? - Yeah, some people can. The psychic I interviewed for this column last month told me things not even Savannah knew. And she donates her time to the police to help solve crimes. She helped me. She took me back, to a Nazi concentration camp in the middle of the forest. It's funny, because as she was talking, I can see everything she was talking about, it was so clear. But who's to know what's real. (dramatic music) - What were you doing in the camp? - It's a little confusing, but, she said I was helping to hide and feed the Jews who were being persecuted by the Nazis. I was part of a Jewish underground resistance group, the Chug Chaluzi. And we hid and fed Jews in the churches to keep them from being sent to concentration camps. She kept referring to me as "Jo". - As in Joe and John? - No, as in J-O, Jo. Anyway, after I became the head of the resistance I was captured when another group was betrayed shortly before the Russians liberated Berlin. I was tortured and hung. - She told you this? - Yeah. - And you believed her? - After telling me things only I know, you're damn right I believe her. Listen, tell the boss I'll be going out of town for a while. - Where out of town? - Just out, to see my daughter, Destiny. - I never knew you had a daughter, and I've known you for many years. - I'm a private person, you know that. She's getting married next week. - You never told me anything about a daughter. - Nevermind that! Look, she turns 22 next week, and she's getting married on her birthday. - Look, Chris, I'm very happy for you, I mean... And you should be happy for her, that's why you need to sober up, you need to clean yourself up. I mean... I gotta go. I've gotta turn in some artwork to a client. - Okay, I'll call you later. - Keep your chin up. - Yeah, thanks. (thunder rumbles) - Hi, honey, we're home! - Hey. You finally made it. Come on in, I got stuff on the stove. - God, he looks so familiar. - Let me help you with that. - I know we usually eat out, but this is a special occasion, right? - Yeah. - [Ben] Excuse me, sir, can you hand me that plate? - Please, call me Christopher. - Christopher. You okay? - Yeah. I'm just glad Destiny's done so well for herself. - [Destiny] Thanks, Dad. - Make yourself comfortable. Dinner's almost ready. - Yeah, sure. - Oh, come with me. It is time for the tour guide. - How about a little champagne to celebrate your arrival? - [Christopher] Thank you. - Oh, I forgot the salt. - Oh, don't worry. I'll get it. - So, mister... Christopher. How was your trip? - Pleasant, thank you. So, how long have you known my Destiny? - Um, seems like we've known each other all our lives. We've been together about three years now. - Destiny tells me you're a model. - As in a citizen? I don't think so. I'm a good example not to follow. - You're perfect, sweetie. Everything looks so wonderful. - Thank you. - You're a good cook. - Thanks. - So, honey, how was your photo shoot? - I've been meaning to talk to you about that. It was good, and some of the guys want to take me out tomorrow night. - Mm. I forgot, the bachelor party. - [Ben] But if you want, we can hang out tomorrow. - Yeah, sure, I like that idea. - Hm, how about a toast? To family. - What no one shall separate. - [Christopher] Cheers. - Cheers. (dramatic piano music) Good show, don't you think? - Interesting. - She always does this, I've seen this film already. But don't worry, I won't ruin the ending for you, it's best if you figure it out for yourself. - She's always slept like this in my lap, ever since she was a little baby. - I'm glad you're here. - I'm happy to be here. - See you tomorrow, bright and early. - Bright and early it is. - Dad? - Hm? - I've gotta go to work now. Okay, there's coffee on the stove, and bagels and fruit in the fridge, so you help yourself to anything you want, okay? - [Christopher] Thanks, sweetheart. - I'm so happy you're here. Okay, I left my work number on the fridge, so you call me if you need anything, okay? - I'm sure I'll be fine. - Okay. I'm gonna be home late from work again tonight. Ben's getting ready to take you around, though. You guys have fun, okay? - Yeah, we will. - Okay. Bye. (waves crashing) (lighthearted music) - I love coming here. It's very relaxing. And every time I feel down, or I just want to clear my mind, I come here. - I know how you feel. Nature has a way of putting us here and sometimes forgetting about us. Ben... Do you believe in reincarnation? (waves crashing) - You mean like dying and coming back? - Yeah, something like that. - I don't know, I never really thought about it. Why? - 'Cause you remind me of someone that... - That what? - Nevermind. - No, what? - No, it would sound nutty, it's- - No, go ahead, tell me. I'm all ears. - Okay. Have you ever had an experience where you feel like you've met someone at another time or another place, and then all of a sudden you see that same person in a different place? - No. (laughs) Hey, that's kinda weird. - I told you it would sound nutty. (waves crashing) - Yeah, you know, I think there's that TV show, "Sights". Yeah, they had this one story about a ghost who took possession of one of the family members who lived in this house. I mean, in no time at all, an uncle, or I think it was a cousin, he was running around acting like a ghost. I mean, they have pictures of it and everything, it was freaky. Christopher. Hello? (claps) Christopher? - Yeah. - Are you all right? You kinda spaced out for a minute there. - Yeah, I was thinking. - Oh, great. - I was thinking of how miraculous life is. You know, it's the little things that make me stop and wonder about our existence. You know, like, even though science is improved now, you have to stop and wonder how every object like an airplane can fly through thin air, or an ocean liner can float on something as light as water. Isn't that incredible how nature prepares us to deal with our own... It's like our souls are driving vehicles of flesh and blood. You know, we cut ourselves, we bleed, and our bodies would heal the wound or the sickness, or sometimes they... (drowned out speaking) - I try not to think too much about that stuff. All right? Life is too short as it is, I don't think we have enough days on the planet to even begin to figure all that out. - There's got to be a higher power at work. When my wife died, I didn't want to live. I felt empty. There was a time I allowed myself to waste away. I just sat in my house and did nothing until one morning I woke up and felt like I needed to continue living, not for my sake, but for those who care about me, those who need me. - Look, I don't like to say I understand, 'cause I really don't. Okay, I can't imagine the pain and suffering that comes with losing someone so close. Someone you spent most of your whole life with. - Sometimes I open my eyes, I'm in a different time, a different place, floating through, just waiting for the next time I open my eyes. (waves crashing) - Yeah. It's getting dark, we should go. (dramatic music) (catchy music) - I'm just trying to make sense as to why you feel the need to- - Watch out, watch out! Why don't you watch where you're going? - Look, it wasn't meant to be. - Look, would you stop it with that? Christ, I've heard enough, okay? I'm not some crazy ghost from the spirit world. I'm from Des Moines. - I'm sorry if I... I'm sorry. - Look, let's just keep it here, on Earth. Okay? - Listen, I didn't mean to piss you off. - I know, I know, you're just making conversation. I mean... We all have habits, all right? That we either need to control or quit altogether. - What does that mean? - Look, I'm... I mean, what is it with you and this, you know? I mean, God! - What? We need to go, you're gonna be late for your night out with your friends. (dramatic music) - I'm going to get ready. (dramatic music) ♪ You have time to live ♪ ♪ Let us all forgive ♪ ♪ Running man will give you ♪ ♪ Crazy people, crazy world ♪ ♪ Crazy people, crazy world ♪ ♪ Crazy people, crazy world ♪ ♪ Crazy people, crazy world ♪ - Aw, shit. ♪ Crazy people, crazy world ♪ ♪ Crazy people, crazy world ♪ (toy box music) (sobbing) (Christopher muttering) (dramatic music) (catchy electronic music) - Oh, come on, of course you can! Now it's your turn. - We're playing spin the bottle without a bottle. - Now, snort up! - Happy trails! You feelin' it? - By the way, where are all the strippers? Aw, you guys have a perfect replacement for the strippers. - I do. We sure do. (catchy electronic music) - Here's to the groom to be! Just relax, buddy. Look ahead. The strippers are dancing! - Guys, I don't feel so well, and I'm pretty sure Steve's just on the bench. (laughing) (wondrous music) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - It's okay. I'm here now. Hold me. - From the first time I saw you, I knew it was you. Good morning, I made you coffee. - Hm. What happened? - I don't know, you tell me. - Mm. I don't know. I just remember being at Bill's, and then I blacked out. Why am I naked? We didn't, um... I mean... Nothing happened, right? Mm! - Shit, I'm sorry. Let me put some cream in it. Oh, shit! - Where did you learn to make such great coffee? - I just added a few of your mother's secret ingredients to her recipe. - Oh. Mm, I am so sorry. It was crazy at the office. Two coworkers called in sick, leaving me with this pile of work, all of it due this morning. I tried to call late last night, but I guess you guys were sleeping. - Yeah, I went to bed early. - I'm so tired. All I want to do is curl up on this couch and go to bed. But I took the rest of the day off so that I could be with you. - You didn't have to do that, I know how important your job is to you. - Oh, nonsense! I still have so much stuff to do for the wedding. I still have to get a wedding dress. I was kinda hoping maybe you'd help me with that. - Sure. - And maybe while we're there we can just pick out your tux. - Sounds like a plan. Alexander, is that you? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. - Who's Alexander? What time is it? - It's almost 1 o'clock. Destiny's asleep on the couch. - Look, I wanted to apologize, for yesterday. - No, no, nonsense. You certainly did nothing wrong, it was me who was out of line, so. - I feel like shit. - (laughs) You're not alone. (chuckling) What's so funny? - Me. Waking up in your bed. I was fucked up. - Don't worry about it. If it'll make you feel any better, it'll be our little secret. - Why do I feel like I've known you for quite a while? - Maybe you have. So, what are the plans for today, hm? - I don't know. Is there something you'd like to do? - Not really. Do you want me to make you something to eat? - Yeah. How about some bagels with strawberries and cream cheese? - Great. Anything else? - No. But I'll take a shower. And some coffee? - Sure, coming up. (phone ringing) Hello? Uh, he's in the shower, who's calling? Yeah, hold on. (shower running) Ben? - Can I get out? - Yeah, it's Bill. - Okay. Tell him I'll call him back. - Uh, yeah, Ben can't talk right now, he said he'll call you back. Yeah. - Can I get a little privacy, please? - Yeah, sure. I'll... Sorry, I'll just be making your bagels. - Okay. You know I'm getting married. - Yeah, I know. - Who's Alexander? - Why do you want to know? (chuckling) - Because you've been calling me Alexander, and I want to know why. - You wouldn't understand. - Try me. - He was someone I knew some time ago. - Do I look like him? - We were very close. - How close? - Very. - How long ago? - From my past life. - Jesus Christ! - Look, would you believe it if I told you he was in my dreams even before Destiny was born? I saw him over, and over, and over. I just didn't know what the connection was. - You gotta give this up, this is messing with your head. - It's true! I met with a psychic for my last column and she confirmed everything. - This is ridiculous! - And she even told me I'll find him again, and she told me we were related. - Did she tell you how crazy this sounds? I mean, Christ, Christopher! Listen to yourself. Okay, let me see if I got this straight. You're telling me that I'm some kind of born again soul- - Why is this so hard for you to imagine, huh? Didn't you say you also saw some things you couldn't understand? If everything is so okay with you, then why are you trying to hard to escape from reality? - No one's trying to escape from anything. - Then why the drug habit? Huh, why? Why the drug habits? Tell me, talk to me, damn it! - I don't want to get into this again, okay? Listen to me. We're about to be related. And I want to have a good relationship with you. But I'm not some old ghost from your past who's back to haunt you, nor am I some former lover of yours. Okay? You need to put things into perspective. You need to differentiate between fantasy and reality. - Yeah, I do have things in perspective. All I know is I'm not the one trying to force myself into a fantasy world. A very dangerous one, I might add. - Look, why don't we just forget this, all right? - I didn't bring it up, you did. - Well, just leave it alone. - Ben, why are you so afraid of? What? - I'm afraid to see you screw up my life. - Ben, I'm not here to mess with your head. - It seems like it. - I've gotta go get ready, I'm going out with Destiny soon. - Christopher? - Yeah? - I'm not Alexander. - Yeah. - Dad, please pass the carrots? - Sure. (dog barking) - So, honey, how was your day? - It was good, it was good. (dog barking) - "So, Destiny, how was your day?" Oh, my day? Honey, great, thanks for asking. Let's see, what did I do today... I got a wedding dress, and I got my dad fitted for a tux. Oh, yes, I went to your secret hideaway place on the beach. (dog barking) Okay, what is going on here? Why is this awkward? Who wants to go first? (dog barking) - There's nothing going on here, right? - Right. - Okay, fine. Since there's nothing going on here... How 'bout dessert? Does anyone want dessert? We're having shit pie. - I'll have some dessert. - Me too. - Do you want me to help you? - [Destiny] No, why don't you stay and get reacquainted? - Did you call Bill? - Um, yeah. He just wanted to make sure I made it home okay. - I see. - So, we have a lot of RSVPs for the wedding, I think we're gonna have a full church. - Will any of your family members be attending? - Excuse me. - Both his parents died in a car accident. - I didn't know that. - It's okay. I don't think he's gotten over it. Don't worry about it, Dad. - Yeah. - Don't worry, give him some time, he'll come around. - Um, has he... What about the rest of his family? - As far I know, he's an only child. I know he had a really rough childhood though. His parents adopted him when he was 5. - Has he ever tried to find out who his real parents are? - I don't know. - Well, have you encouraged him to- - I try to stay out of it. - That must be hard on him. - I'm sure it is. - Can you imagine not knowing where you come from or who you really are? (phone ringing) - Hello? Hey, Jennifer, how you doin'? Uh huh, she does? That's great, that is great. Okay, when? Does it have to be tonight? Okay, okay. All right, make it an hour. That was my office. They need me to come in, it was a client, it was a proposal that we submitted this morning and... I gotta go. I hate to leave you and Ben. - Don't worry about it, we'll be all right. - It's just that... With this wedding and the client and everything, I feel like I'm not spending enough time with Ben. - Don't worry. I'll find something for us to do until you get home. It's okay. - Thanks, Dad. (lighthearted piano music) I miss mom. I wish she were here. - Yeah, I miss her too. - What do you think she'd be doing if she was here right now? (chuckling) - Well, I know she'd be very excited about your wedding. She'd be here helping you pick out wedding invitations, helping you shop for your dress, throwing you a big bridal shower. But watching you turn into a grown up woman, mostly, she'd be very proud. Very proud, as I am, to be here with you. - Dad... I've never told anyone this, but sometimes I can feel her presence. Sometimes I can smell the perfume she used to wear. That rose, do you remember that? I remember everything about her. Her hair, her skin, the way it felt. Her blue eyes, her smile. (dog barking) She always thought I could have the world if I wanted it. I owe you both for everything that I am. - This is not the time to get emotional. You've got to go to work, and I've... I've gotta go apologize to a certain special person in our lives. - You're right. Oh, god, look at the time, I have to go. - Go, go, it's okay. Savannah, are you here? Are you listening to your daughter? (melancholic piano music) - Um... I've been acting like an asshole lately, and I want to apologize. - No, I apologize asking about your parents. I wasn't aware that... - Don't worry about it. - Water under the bridge? - Cheers. - Cheers. You've gotta give Destiny a hand, she's quite a worker. I don't know how she does it. She's planning the wedding, juggling a high pressure job, she's amazing. - What's amazing? - You are amazing. - No, I'm not. I'm just some regular guy. - No, you're not just a regular guy, you're my family. - Cheers to that. - Cheers. - Question. - Yup? - What was he like? - Who? - Alexander. (chuckling) - Well, now that's a loaded question. - It was just a question, you don't have to answer if you don't want to. - No, no, it's not a problem. My recollection of us meeting is at a bar. I remember the Nazis keeping this bar "The Owl" open, to corral some of the Jews. If they presumed you were Jewish, they took you to these barracks marked with pink triangles. To many, they applied the Paragraph 175 law. - What's Paragraph 175? - It was a law in Germany at the time that prohibited people from engaging in homosexual acts. If you were presumed to be gay you were imprisoned, or used as a guinea pig in government experiments. You know, back then Germany considered women as reproductive vessels to fill the country with more citizens, thereby making it a stronger nation. - Sounds like a nightmare. Sounds like my childhood. - Tell me about it. - My childhood? - Yeah. - Hopping around from home to home. Shipped around, just... I don't know, place to place. But eventually a place with a family, and they treat you nice, send you to school, teach you the importance of doing what you believe in. I always wanted to be a performer, so, I'm in this showcase and this guy approaches me, offers me a job in New York. And the rest is history. - Cheers to that. - And you? What was your childhood like? - I had a very abusive father. He always beat my mother and blamed her for my mistakes. - How so? - My father thought that I wasn't good enough to face the world. That basically I was worthless. Nothing I ever did was good enough for him. So, then I met Savannah. We both ran away from home, we eloped. - And what was she like? - She was beautiful. Inside and out. She was a very generous, very giving woman. She always believed in people. She believed in me, for one. - What do you mean? - We didn't meet under the best of circumstances. I was angry at my father for beating my mother and kicking me out of the house. Nothing I ever did for him was good enough. Anyway, I was drunk and looking to show him that I could control someone, that I could be a man. That I could be just like him. - What happened? - Savannah was coming from the library when I saw her. She was so beautiful. I followed her and... (ominous music) I don't want to talk about this anymore. - That's okay. Tonight's our night to celebrate. - Celebrate what? - Surviving. - [Christopher] We're already drunk as it is. - Well, now it's time to get really wasted. - [Christopher] I don't think I can drink anymore without getting sick. - Come on, one more, for me. - No, I can't, it's- - Come on! - Ah, okay. - Do the countdown. Three, two, one... See? Not so bad. - Whoa, I don't like to mix alcohol. - Let's do another one. - Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick. (puking) - Are you okay? Let me get you some aspirin. (heavy breathing) Here. Here. You okay? - Yeah, yeah. Where do we go from here? - I don't know. - I'm in bed with my future... Are you okay with this? - Are you? (dramatic classical music) - Dad? Ben? - [Ben] What, what? - [Christopher] Destiny! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (waves crashing) (lighthearted music) - I love coming here. It's very relaxing. Every time I feel down or I just want to clear my mind, I come here. - I know what you mean. Nature has a way of putting us here and sometimes forgetting about us. Ben, do you believe in reincarnation? Do you believe in reincarnation? Do you believe in reincarnation? (dramatic classical music) (heavy breathing) No! (heavy breathing) (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) - What, what? - Destiny! - Let's go for a drive. (dramatic string music) Can I speak to Charlie Osborne please? Hi, Charlie. My name is Ben Ross, I'm a friend of Christopher Hayes. Yeah. And I got your number from the magazine here, X4. I was wondering if you could put me in contact with an Elvia Flores. He interviewed, yes, yes, for "The Singing Forest". Yes. Thank you. (dramatic music) (knocking) Hello? Hi, are you Elvia Flores? - That's my name. - Do you have a minute? - I'm sorry, I'm with someone right now. - It's really important. Do you remember a man by the name of Christopher Hayes? - His name sounds familiar. - He interviewed you regarding an article he wrote, "The Singing Forest". - Yes, I remember. I don't know how long I'm gonna be with my guest, this could take a while. - I can wait. I don't mind, really. - Okay, come on in. As soon as I'm finished, I'll talk to you. (dramatic music) Keep the faith. Please, have a seat. - Thank you. - What is so urgent you need to talk to me about? - Christopher Hayes spoke to you some time ago of a certain recollection of memories he's having? - I remember. Christopher is a man who is aware of his surroundings when most are asleep. He's developed a sensibility to connect with his past life, therefore avoiding the pitfalls most of us fall into. - I need to know if I'm the one he keeps seeing. - I can't tell you that. - Why? - I never talk to others about anyone else but themselves. I do it out of respect and courtesy. - Please? I need your help. - I could read you. - Okay. - Do you believe in fate? - Yes. - You're about to get married. - Yes. Yes, I am. - You have found your soulmate. - I have. - You two love each other very much. Fate has town you apart. However, you must unite with destiny, that is your fate. - Thank you. - Be in tune with your spirit and you will see how everything works out for you and yours. In two stories, there are usually three realities. Yours, theirs, and what really happens. But who's to say what's happening from what's not? We might not be able to control circumstance, but we can control our actions and act on our feelings. You're hurting inside, but don't let destiny pass you by. I think you'll be able to figure the rest out. You've been here before. Go and have a happy life with your loved ones. - Thank you. (toy box music) - I'm sorry. I tried calling her job, she hasn't been there since that night. - What did you say? - She took a leave of absence. - What are you doing? Are you leaving? - It was wrong of me to come here in the first place. Scary is I haven't seen my daughter since she left for college, and this is what I do to her? I just hope that she can forgive me some day. - I don't think you're resolving anything by leaving. - My father was right. I'm not good enough. - What do you mean? Do you know how many people's lives you touch with your writing? Like mine. - You read my article? - Yes. I had to see for myself what you were talking about, so I went to see her. - [Christopher] What happened? - We spoke, and I think you're right about this lady, there's something very real about her, and I believe her. - Well, I'm not so sure about any of this. (dramatic music) The cab should be here any minute. - I hate to see you go, I feel like this is all my fault. - We can't keep blaming ourselves, what happened is done. - I'm glad to see that you... You know, we were drunk and- - It's pretty clear what I saw. - I believe you. - No, I don't want you or Ben to leave. I thought about this. - And what? What do you want me to do? I'll do whatever you want. - You're the only man I have ever loved in my entire life. I just want you to love me. - I love you. - But how can I compete with your desires? - I love you, I- - What about my father? - You're a part of me, and I'm a part of you. I would never do anything to hurt you, never. It's all my fault. I think I've caused enough trouble around here. - No, wait. I've thought about this. You came here to walk me down the aisle to the only man I have ever loved in my entire life. And that's what I want you to do. Okay? - We can't pretend this didn't happen. - It happened. I don't have anyone left. You both are my family. And I'm not about to give up on you, either one of you. (dramatic music) (sobbing) - Are you ready? - Whenever you are. - So, tell me about the people you've helped. - I never talk to others about anyone else but themselves. I do it out of perspective courtesy. - Sounds like you have many great stories to tell. - Actually, I do have a story to tell. Now, I'm not going to name any names of the living involved in this tragic love story, so, feel free to write it. It's about an unborn spirit called Destiny. - [Charlie] What do you mean an unborn spirit, was she aborted? - No. She a product of rape, a miscarriage. Destiny united two old souls from their past life. Fate tore them apart. Destiny brought them together. (dramatic music) (somber music)
