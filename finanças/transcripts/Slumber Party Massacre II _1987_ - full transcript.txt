Everybody's got one. No, that's not it. I've been having really horrible nightmares about that stuff that happened at Trish Craven's when I was 12. I thought you were over that. Yeah, me, too, but I keep dreamin' about this-- this really weird guy. And last night, he was in bed with me. I think you should have some juice, have some toast, and you'll feel a lot better after you eat something. Last night, in my dream, he killed Valerie. I mean, it was real. I could feel him. I could feel him breathe on me. You know, I read a doctor's report once about something called subconscious projection. He kissed me and it was real. Courtney, it's the kind of dream you have when you drink too much. [ Happy chatter] [Laughs] Oh, my God. [ Laughs] Cannon ball! Whoa! JEFF: Hey! You rogue monster. Chill out, man. T.J., man! Shit.

Is this the offending bird? [Laughs] Courtney, honey, you probably just opened the door too fast, and it fell out. Oh, I can do it. Hey. Are you sure you're feeling okay? COURTNEY: Not really. I've been feeling really nervous and... weird. I can't get that dream out of my mind. You think maybe you hit your head when you fell in the pool? - Uh-uh, I don't think so. - You know what it was? It was all that booze we had last night. I've been feeling kinda edgy myself today. You know, you should try to relax. Take a hot bath. Yeah. I guess I've never had a hangover like this before.

I think your sweetheart's been takin' too many diet pills. Hey, she's ruining my weekend. Hey, shut up, man. This whole thing is Sheila's fault. I mean, she's the one that opened the champagne and who knows what else. See, you're just getting uptight again. You're uptight. Smoke your head. Courtney should go see a shrink if she can't loosen up. Would you guys chill out? Please? T.J.: God. [Sighs] I'm not crazy. I'm not. I saw it. And I heard him laughing. He's in this house somewhere. Courtney, it's okay. I believe you saw something. Have any of you heard anything or seen anybody else strange around here? No. Only Courtney. Very funny. Now, where is Sally? I've looked all over for her and I don't know where she is. Great, man. Oh, fuck you. [Scoffs ] She probably just went to the store. All the cars are still here, T.J. This is getting too stupid. For once in your life, T.J., won't you just shut up? God. I mean, maybe, just maybe... there is a psycho running around here. [Chuckles] Courtney, why don't you go lie down? Okay? I'm gonna go call the cops. Oh, God. Anybody got any tranqs? [Grinding noise] Who turned on the trash compactor? Well, I don't know. It was-- It was on when we came in here. [Crunching noise] Probably just some old bones. [Crunching noise] MAN: Now, let me get this straight. You saw Sally's face explode in the bathroom, but you haven't seen her since, dead or alive. And you think that she's in the trash compactor, but you're afraid to look, right? Yes. When did this happen? Uh, about three hours ago. Did you see her? Was her face intact? Well, the last time I saw her was about two o'clock, but she was okay then. No! Go away, you're supposed to be dead. [Laughs] Is this Sally Burns? [T.J. chuckling] Yes. Christ, where have you been? Uh, I just went to the store to get some more Oxy 10 and, well, I-- I met this outrageous guy. He was such a babe and, um, I-- Did I do something wrong? You freaked out your little friends here. And you wasted about 200 dollars of the taxpayers' money, but you didn't do anything wrong. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what kind of drugs this one is on and I don't care, because I don't wanna have to deal with her mother and father and the fancy lawyers. But I'll tell you brats somethin': If you jerk my chain in my town I'll rip your lungs out. Come on, Krueger. Denny's is holding our booth. I'm on my way. Y'all have a nice day. - What is the matter with--? - I don't know. Courtney just-- Courtney needs some time alone. I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm sorry. I must be just goin' crazy. Do you wanna go home? No, right now I just-- I'm so tired I just don't wanna do anything. Okay? Matt, we're gonna go get something to eat. Okay? Yeah, we're starved too, huh? All right. I think we need to stay here. - Let's go. - Come on. [Sobbing] H' Ready for a surprise dessert? COURTNEY: Dessert? Happy Birthday, Courtney. COURTNEY: Wow! I'd sing Happy Birthday to you but my singing would gross you out. It's beautiful. Thank you. Gotta take a big breath. No, I'm just gonna look at it for a while. It's too pretty. Aren't you gonna make a wish? I've already got my wish. Hey. Hey, this is supposed to cheer you up. Matt, I don't know if I'm going crazy or what. You must think I am the weirdest person in the whole world. No. No, I think you're a very sensitive person, but something bad happened to you when you were little and all the excitement from your crazy friends brought it back a little while today. You know what happened at the Cravens'? Yeah. The Cravens are really good friends with my parents. And I know you and your sister helped kill the murderer and that's a really heavy trip. Yeah, and he's dead. Isn't he? Yeah, they're dead. [Overlapping chatter] I know, I know. Hey, I have musical ability. T.J., show them-- [Overlapping chatter] T.J.! Yeah! -[ Banging on drums] - Whoo!
