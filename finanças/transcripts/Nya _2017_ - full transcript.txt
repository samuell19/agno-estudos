Hello. Are you there yet, daddy? How’s mum? Don’t worry about the house. I will take good care of it. Come on, daddy. Don’t worry about me, too. Yes, Dad. Yes, Dad. Bye. Hello! I’m already here, dude. I’m just supposed to get the key, right? Are you sure that somebody’s up there? Okay, then. What? I’ve just come to get a key. Ma’am. Have my friend told you about that? Yes… Yes.. He did. Come with me. Yeah. He told me about the key. But I forget where I kept it. I think I saw it here before. It’s alright if you can’t find it. I’m looking for it now! What are you doing? Nothing. Ummmm… I want to go to toilet. Come along with me. Ma’am… I heard something from the room. No, I don’t hear anything. And I live here alone. Ma’am… I’m leaving. You can’t leave. I will get the key. It’s okay. I will just leave. You can’t… you can’t leave! You can’t go anywhere. You can’t leave! You can’t go anywhere. Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? What shall we do about them? We will talk about it later. It’s weird. I feel terrified and guilty. How will May Sue Maung feel about it? What shall we do then? I dare not tell my parents. We did foolishly. I wish I were dead. Don’t be like that! All of us will be in trouble. We will think it calmly. How can it be? It’s about somebody’s death. And he is my boyfriend. Had we known, we wouldn’t have done like that. He is our close friend. Yes. We are really desperate. It is only 2 days now but we can’t hide it for long. This concerns with everyone, not only me. Cham Min, it is your plan. Hey, nothing to do with me. Why are you blaming me? We all did together. - I refused at first. - But you accepted it. That’s enough. It’s not the time to argue. Let it be, May Sue Maung. You know him. I am sorry. Don’t blame each other. It really happened. Hey, I am not trying to excuse myself. But she is the only one who knows what actually happened on that night. I did what we all had planned. Don’t put a blame on me. No, I am not. If you have clear conscience, it is okay. Cham Min, you are going too far. Cham Min, you remember it, right? Do it exactly. But you can’t make any mistakes in the room. No, I don’t want to do that. Don’t tease my boyfriend. We fool around on every April Fool’s days. Come on. Only you can do it. Go ahead. Are you sure that he will come only to that room? Sure! He will be in that room because we will lock other rooms. Then, alright. Hey, there he comes! - Have you guys been here for long? - Not so long. - What’s so funny? - Nothing. By the way, when will you study abroad? The school will begin next month. I will leave as soon as I get the Visa. Wish you all the best and success in America! CHEERS! Who is it? Who is it? SURPRISE! Oh, you are kidding me. Come on, get up. Enough. Stop kidding me. Babe? Babe? Hey, open the door. You are taking so long… what are you doing? Yeah. And look at him. All sprawled on the floor. What are you doing? And what’s up with him? Dude, get up. It’s not bedtime yet. Nyein Thaw… Get up. What’s wrong with him? He… He’s not breathing. Jeez… you’re kidding. Yeah. Don’t joke around. Let’s go. Aren’t we eating out after this? Let’s go! Cham Min… Have a look. Aung Ye Htike. Are you also getting in on this joke? No… I really mean it. He really isn’t breathing. Nyein Thaw. Nyein Thaw. Nyein Thaw. Come on. Stop kidding. What’s wrong? May Sue Maung, what did you do? I just scared him like we all planned… When the light came on, he fell down. - Why’d he fall down? - How would I know? Dose he have heart disease? He doesn’t. He’s never told us. Cham Min… What do we do? Wait… I’m thinking. I think he’s dead. No way. He can’t possibly be dead. Hospital… Take him to a hospital? - Yeah… I’ll call an ambulance. - Wait. What if they ask why? How would you answer? That he just collapsed by himself. Kids… Can I leave now? I’ll pay her and let her leave. I’ll come, too. I’m scared. Fix your expression. How was it? I did just like you asked me to. It was great. Here you are. Thanks. Thank you. Call me if you need me again. I’ll be leaving then. Bye. Khay Mo… What are we going to do? - Has the woman left? - Yeah He’s no longer alive. Really? Babe. Are you guys sure? We are so screwed. What are we going to do? What will we tell his family? His parents are out of town, right? I heard they’re in Singapore. They are. But we can’t hide this for long. What do we do? I didn’t do this. I didn’t kill him. Stop being so loud. If everyone finds out… it’ll be a problem. I didn’t kill him. Let’s do this… May Sue Maung. You should just leave. The way you are now, people will find out. Can she go home by herself? I’ll help her get a taxi. May Sue Maung, come with me. And wipe your tears. - What will you do with him? - We’ll figure it out. Just go. I can stay with you guys. Just leave… You won’t be able to help anyway. May Sue Maung, Come on! What did you guys do? Where did you leave Nyein Thaw? I’m asking you. Cham Min… Just tell her. We… buried him in the woods. You… What were you all thinking? We didn’t know what to do and we were scared. Khay Mo, you all are joking, right? You didn’t actually do that. We… We really buried him. You’ve all gone crazy. Are you even thinking like humans? Is it this easily settled? It’s not like we wanted to resort to that. He’s right. We didn’t know what to do on that day. Look, we’re sorry for that. But now we need to think how to deal with this when people find out. You should have thought that from the start. you? You’re so inconsiderate, leaving my boyfriend just like that. How could.. May Sue Maung… Nyein Thaw’s also our best friend. We didn’t just carelessly leave him. But we… we are scared of getting arrested. We know… that we’re wrong. But you’re the main reason Nyein Thaw died. No… No. Khay Mo… We were all just pulling a prank on him Aung Ye Htike, I even said I didn’t want to do it. We only helped you clean up this mess. We’re also scared of being involved. Where did you bury him? I’m asking you. We were in a rush that day so we don’t remember where. Nyein Thaw… hasn’t died, right? Would we joke at a time like this? Please tell me. Don’t you feel sorry for me? Where did you bury him? We… really don’t remember. - All of you are lying to me, aren’t you? - Don’t be like this to your own friend. Do you guys even consider me a friend? Calm down, May Sue Maung. If you are gonna be like that, we won’t be able to talk. We’re leaving. Guys, let’s go. What do we do now? We’ll stick to the original plan. There’s no need to change it. Where are you guys headed to? Want a ride? It’s alright. We’ll hang out at a café. Nyein Thaw Just show this and explain it to her. I’ll make sure it goes exactly as planned. Ohh how about the old lady? We’ve contacted her. How about the place? Did you take care of it? Yeah. It was so embarrassing to ask Tracy though. You should go in. My girlfriend might notice. SURPRISE! He’s not breathing. He’s no longer alive. You leave now. - Are they gone? - Yes. Oh God. All this just to pull a prank. May’s going to be mad at me. You are the one who wanted to make a surprise event and wow her on her birthday. We’re just helping you out. I know. Guys! Yay! We did it! Don’t show up for the next 5 days. That’s easy. Guys, let’s go. God, I’m exhausted. Took some time to comfort her before she finally left. Where’s Nyein Thaw? Tracy. Tracy, thank you for letting us use this place. You’re welcome. Everything okay? Yes. Mm. Then, go and return this key for me. You said you would, right? Oh. Of course. Thanks for lending us this place. What’s your uncle’s address? It’s a bit far, in the outskirts of the city. Then, we’ll return the key tomorrow morning. No. You promised. Of course… We will go now. Is this the right place? There’s nothing or no one in sight. Just where does her uncle live? I don’t know either. She said he has a temporary home. Did we get the place wrong? I took the correct road. We also saw the sign. Tracy’s phone is off. I think that bitch tricked us. Wow. April Fool. We’ve been so caught up in her joke. Ah. Didn’t we play a prank on her last year? But I don’t think she’s that kind of person. Oh… right. She’s crushing on you so she wouldn’t trick you, right? Is it them? Who else could it be at a place like this? Must be them. Babe. What have you done so far? I’m coming back soon with my parents. I’m done with the hotel reservation. You and Moe Yathaw are taking care of the dress, right? Mm. I gave the job to Moe. I should buy gifts for that woman. She’s been helping out a lot. Yeah. I would’ve been really lost on my own. Ahh… I forgot. Babe. Please… do me a favour. What is it, baby? You know our photo and the teddy bear I gave you? Can you send those to Moe’s home? Tonight? Okay. I’ll do that tomorrow morning. No. It has to be tonight. I already told Moe. I forgot about it. Why doe it have to be now? Umm… I asked Moe to consult a fortune teller. She said we need to do this for our wedding to go smoothly. Myat Noe. You’re still into those things? Babe… You don’t even want to do this? I had to arrange this all the way from here for the sake of our future, and you don’t even do this much. I didn’t say I won’t. I said I’ll do it in the morning. Moe has to do the ritual tomorrow at 6 A.M. 6 A.M? Fine. Fine. I am going now. That’s why I love you. Get going then. Bye. Leaving now. Love you. Bye, Love you too. Moe Yathaw! Moe Yathaw! Can’t you call me ahead? Now I have to rush out. You two still believe in fortune telling? Hey. I’m doing what your Myat Noe asked me to. Alright. What is it that you have to do? Why should I tell you? My friend probably doesn’t trust you. We’re getting flowers tomorrow, right? You’re coming? Yeah, I will. Miss Myat Noe has given me the order. We owe you a lot. We’ll set a blind-date for you after we get married. You can’t say no. - Just leave already. - I’ll call you. NAT SHINE KO. NAT SHINE KO. Did you move this? I moved it for a while. You don’t need to touch my mom’s picture. Know your place. You son of a mistress. Don’t touch. My mom’s picture. I was going to put it back. That’s your punishment. Remember this. Moe, that’s enough. Come on. Let’s go back outside. You want to go home? Wanna come to my house? Where should I send you? Hi, babe. Look! Do I look pretty? Can’t you say it out loud? You look pretty. Babe. What’s wrong? Nothing. Not feeling too well. Baby, I’m coming back soon so get everything ready. I want to get married right away once I’m back. I know. I’ll get everything ready. Hmph. You’re not doing this alone. My bestie Moe Yathaw is helping out a lot, you know. Moe Yathaw: Come to my home now! Oh… Myat Noe. I need to go pick up something from Moe. Really? Okay then. I’ll call your Viber later. Moe, why did you call me over? What’s wrong? Don’t act like nothing happened. Is it about the other day? We both agreed to forget about it. That’s impossible now. Why? I’m asking you. - It’s you, right? - What? - You secretly took a video, right? - Are you crazy? Why would I do that? Besides, we didn’t mean for that to happen. What… What’s wrong? What video are you talking about? I’m asking you. Tell me! They send me a text message. They said they’ll spread this sextape. Who did this? How did they secretly film this? - How would I know? - Do they want money? I don’t know. They only sent me this text. I don’t know what to do so I called you. No… This is bad. If Myat Noe finds out, we’re both done for. I called them but the phone was turned off. Myat Noe’s calling. H-Hello? Myat Noe. I’m heading to Moe’s home. I need to get something. I’m not there yet. I’ll call you back when I get there. I know. I’ll tell her. Love you. OK. Bye. Russell. What are we gonna do? Try calling them again. Maybe their phone is on now. The subscriber you are calling is power off! What do they want? Hey, it’s Myat Noe, right? Answer it! No, I’m scared. Pull yourself together or she will notice. I just want to die now. We have to take care of this before Myat Noe’s back. Where’s your brother? Don’t know. Probably in his room. Don’t ask me about him. I’m in a bad mood. I am afraid he will hear us. He isn’t here. It’s fine. Don’t worry about him. I’m leaving. I shouldn’t stay too long. Russell, you should do something. I can’t do anything unless they call us. And watch your step. There’s someone watching us now. Where have you been? Meet us in lane (3) in the woods out of the town! Tomorrow at 9pm. To exchange the video file. Could it be them? Who else could it be at a place like this? Must be them. No matter what, we have to get the video back. What is it? Did you send us the message? What message? Don’t play dumb with me. What do you guys want? Look… Is this a joke? Be a man. Why won’t you admit it after what you’ve done? Hey. What are you talking about? We have no idea. We were wondering what kind of people could be this cruel. Do you have nothing to do? Are you that fucking free? Look. Let me say this. We are all about the same age. Please try putting yourself in our shoes. We know nothing about what you’re saying. Guys. May be Tracy sent them? Did Tracy send you? Who’s Tracy? Then you’ve got the wrong people. We were tole to come to a place like this at this hour. And now we meet. There’s no way this is a mistake. Sis, let’s talk between us girls. Explain your situation so we can understand. Don’t call me sis. Okay. What the hell do you want then? That’s our line. Why did you ask us to meet you? Wait. This is a misunderstanding. I think Tracy is playing a joke on us. I said that’s not possible. Then, let’s just leave. We can return the key later. Cham Min, let’s go. Didn’t you do this? What… Isn’t this over yet? Leave us alone. Yeah, aren’t you done yet? If this is a joke, just stop it. Nutcases. Hey. We’re speaking nicely. Don’t be rude. Don’t touch her. Dude. Aren’t you ashamed? No need to get physical with a woman. Your bitch started it. Enough. Aung Ye Htike, we’re leaving. This has nothing to do with us. You’ve got the wrong people. Let's go. Don’t come any closer. I won’t do anything to her. Just give us the video file. I will let her go. Let me go. I don’t know. Give our video first! What video? If something happens to my girlfriend, you’re a dead meal. I am telling you to let her go. Stay still. What video? Tell us first. You guys made it. Don’t play dumb. Let me go! We won’t give if you are not telling. You have to tell us first. The video you secretly took of us. This really is a mix-up. We don’t know anything. We came here because our friend asked us to. Meeting at a place like this? There’s no way this is a mix-up. Do you want money? I can give you. You’ve really got the wrong people. Let’s do this. You let go of her first. Then we’ll give you the video file. Let her go! - Nyein Thaw! - Nyein Thaw! Cham Min, go get the car. GO GET THE CAR! Nyein Thaw! Stay with us. Guys. The car won’t start. What? What do we do? All of this is your fault. I’ve got nothing to do with this. You hit your own friend. It was an accident. This isn’t my fault. He isn’t responding. Nyein Thaw! Because of you two… I’ll spread your sextape. - Please don’t. - I beg you. Our lives will be over. Please don’t. We didn’t mean for this to happen. Then, you guys take him. Cham Min, what are you saying? You guys take him and bury him. Cham Min, what are you thinking? He is already dead. Will you bury him? Aung Ye Htike, will you do that? Are we going to jail? I don’t want to be arrested. Hey, if you take him and bury him, I promise I won’t spread your video. We’ll be arrested. How could we do that? I’m not asking you to go to the police. Just bury him somewhere and act like you know nothing. We’ll be in trouble. Fine. Then your video file will get out. Please don’t. We’ll take him. Where? It’s not like we have any choice. Cham Min, please don’t! Bring the body to his car. Please don’t. Hey, come and help us. Moe Yathaw, open the door. Mother. It’s been one year and a month now. Are you doing well? I’m doing fine here. I try to get along with Step-sister, too. I’m going out today. I’m gonna take some videos on the streets. Don’t you think it’s time to awake? Mom. I am going now. You’re really getting on my nerves. Put away that stupid camera. Behave yourself. Don’t forget that you can live comfortably because of my dad. And stop your stupid acts. I can break your camera anytime. - My mom bought this for me. - So what? What are you doing on the train track? You’d be under the train now if not for me. Hey, you should thank me I saw the train get closer so I ran quickly and pulled you away. It’s none of your business. Otherwise, you would’ve died. I want to die. Now you’ve ruined my plans. Why do you want to die? I’m asking you. What if your parents find out about this? There’s no way they’ll find out. Have they passed away? My mom’s still alive. She’s happy with her new husband and kids She won’t even know if I’m dead or alive. Is that why you want to die? Don’t you have things you want to do? I have a lot. I don’t want to die before I get to do these things. Actually, I do. Will you help me? Come with me. I am Nat Shine Ko. I am Tracy. Do I wait here? It’s okay. Come with me. - Do you live here alone? - Yes. Your mom lets you live alone? She sent a maid to accompany me. But she doesn’t know I sent her back. Anyway, you said you’ll help me, right? Tell me why you wanted to kill yourself back there. You don’t seem that miserable to me. I just lost my mind. Because I hate people. Some people. I’ve been wanting to talk about these things with someone. I had no one to talk to. Did you wait long? You must be excited? Nyein Thaw has something to tell you. He asked Tracy to come and he’s taking so long. There he is. Dude, you are the one who asked Tracy to come. Sorry. Got stuck in traffic. Sorry, Tracy, I’m a bit late. Have you bought the tickets? Yes. You have something to say, right? Oh. Give us some space. Nope. Say it now. Tracy. I… umm… Tracy, I love you. Tracy, are you mad? Then say something. Come on, Tracy. Tracy, do you love me? Say it. I love you. April Fool! You lose your bet, Cham Min No, No… Sorry, Tracy. Today is April Fool’s so we’re joking. It’s just an April Fool’s joke. Don’t be mad. What’s happening? Nothing. - Your boy… - Dude. She’s mad. Go comfort her. - Babe… What’d you do again? - Nothing. You guys are really… Nyein Thaw, too. It’s only been 3 days since we started dating. He’s still so goofy. It’s just an April Fool’s joke. And Tracy’s crazy for Nyein Thaw. It’s so obvious. I had to try so hard not to laugh She said she loves him. So cheap. He won’t like someone like her. She aims pretty high. She can’t compare to me. Cham Min dared Nyein Thaw and said he’ll buy him anything if he does this. Oh. Then, I should get half of that bet. Did you see her face when you told her? Mom. I’ve framed your picture. I just tried hanging it in the living room. You look so pretty, Mom. Oh, I’m pretty close to Tracy now. I feel sorry for her, Mom. She’s very lonely. I’ve been using this camera to shoot videos. I’ve shot quite a lot now. Nat Shine Ko! Did you move this? That’s the punishment, Remember it! Calm down. I went to your house but didn’t see you. I won’t try to kill myself again. Don’t worry. No. I have something to show you. Who are they? My sister. Now I have something to use against them. I’ve even threatened them. But they don’t know it’s me. Nyein Thaw came to my home the other day. You have an old apartment in downtown, right? You’ve mentioned it before. What do you want? Ah… Sorry. I spoke too hastily. I’m sorry about what happened back them. No problem… It’s almost been a year. Are you still mad? No. Just tell me what you’re here for. We want to play a prank between our friends. So… your apartment… I just got an idea. I’ll let them borrow my uncle’s apartment. I don’t get it. You have your sister’s sex tape, right? I’ll let them use my uncle’s apartment… and make them do something. Just do what I tell you. We’ll set the two groups against each other. Wow… How did I come up with this idea? Oh… it’s my uncle’s apartment. You have to return the key once you’re done. Is that okay? Or I’ll return it today. We’ll be done once the joke’s over. We can do it. Thank you, Tracy. Good luck! How are you feeling right now? I am happy. They’ll suffer like I did. What if they find out about us? I don’t care. Just make sure your peeps come to the right place. They wouldn’t dare not come. Big sister. If you don’t come tomorrow, the video of you fooling around goes online. I’m going home. Thank you. As long as they get into trouble, I’m satisfied. Don’t let anything go wrong. You have to follow them outside the city. Give me your number. We can’t do like this. Hey. Come and help me. Hey, you drive. You said you couldn’t start the car. I couldn’t before. It works only now. How rare of you stop by. What’s the matter? I have something to do. Oh, don’t be alarmed. We just joked around. How about you get some tea nearby? We need to talk. Ok. You can leave the key. - Then I'm leaving. - Alright. What is this place? My father’s old garage. It’s been unused for ages. I have to talk to you in private. What are we gonna do about it? What? Why’d you make that mess? Cham Min… You’ve done it all wrong. So we won’t get into trouble. Dude, don’t say “we”. We’ve got nothing to do with this. It’s you who hit Nyein Thaw. But not on purpose. It was an accident. This mess can only get bigger. You have to clean it up yourself. Yeah. Don’t drag us in. But we already made those two take care of him. Are you out of your mind? You can’t solve it that way. You just made things worse. Then why didn’t you stop me? Why did you keep your mouth shut? I really can’t get arrested. I have to do something. Babe… let’s go. - I haven’t finished. - Go away. Anybody outside? Please help us. Stop it! What do you want from us? Please leave us alone. Don’t do this to your own friends. Open the door. I’m the one in the bad spot. Please calm down I need to talk to you guys. Come with me, please. I want to make a deal with you two. I don’t have bad intentions. You know I’m studying abroad soon. I can’t ruin my dream for anything. Just how selfish are you? Our close friend died. What will we tell his family? And his girlfriend May Sue Maung? Also, who are those people we met back in the woods? I don’t know anymore. Please listen to me for a minute. Pretend that didn’t happen. Nyein Thaw died because of his girlfriend May Sue Maung. We’ll tell everyone it was because of a prank. That’s absurd. What if they ask the body? We buried him in the woods. We don’t remember where. Just tell that to May Sue Maung. We’ll tell the others that Nyein Thaw is missing. You’re so cruel. I can’t do that. Mister… Mister… I beg you. Don’t scream. Aung Ye Htike. You don’t need to pay me back the 20 million. Babe… I had to borrow money from him when I need I’ll definitely pay you back. Don’t pressure me. Do you need more money? How much more should I give you? I know you need money for your wedding. I can also help you with your debt. Khay Mo, your family doesn’t approve of Aung Ye Htike, right? I’ll help you guys have a grand wedding. I don’t want to go to jail. I don't. When did you borrow that much money? I was in debt for gambling. Let’s accept it. Don’t we also need money? We’ll pretend nothing happened. Please, babe. - No… I can’t. - Please, babe. We accept your offer. It’s not like we backed off because of money. But please keep your promise as compensation. If something happens, you have to take care of it yourself. I agree. Thank you so much guys. Tracy…? Tracy…? Come inside. What’s wrong with you? What’s going on? What is it? We can’t help the situation now. We have to go on with our plan. Are you crazy? A person died because of us. It's nothing to do with us. You said you want to make your sister suffer. She bullied you a lot, right? Now is your turn. Think about your mom. How small she must have felt with them. Are you turning them in? I want them to feel miserable for a long long time. Don’t be weak. I’m going home. Anybody there? Please untie me. Who’s there? You! You’re the one we met outside the city. Yes. Stay calm. Your head is injured. I didn’t do it. One of your friends did. I don’t remember anything. How did I get here? Where are my friends? Your friends left you with me. I don’t understand them at all. You guys have our video, don’t you? We don’t. Really. Believe me. You probably don’t know. Your friends already admitted it. They have it. We will let you go when the time comes. Your friends carelessly left you, thinking you’re dead. Even if you return… it won’t be good for you. Then things will get more complicated. It’ll be better for me to go back and clear it back. No way. If you do that, we’ll have to take actions. I promise. I’ll let you go as soon as I get the video. You should think about how they actually treat you. Untie me, please. I’ll get you something to eat. Don’t move too much for now. You hurt your head. Nyein Thaw! Hello? Hello? It’s me, Russell. Yes. I’ve taken care of your friend. I will make sure nobody knows. His phone is in my hand. Oh. Okay. That’s all, right? Not so fast. Give us our video file. Or you’ll be in trouble. When will you release me? This is a crime. As soon as your friends give us what we want, we’ll let you go. I’ll say this for you. The people who easily left you thinking you’re dead… will you forgive them easily? Not your business. Look… I’m asking you to put up with this for a while. We don’t do anything to you or torture you. We’ll set you free when it’s time. My family will be worried. My girlfriend must be clueless. They’ve probably arranged something. Your death hasn’t shown up in the newspaper. Then don’t tie me up. I don’t trust anyone. You could run away. It’s Myat Noe. I’ll take the call outside. Will they really bring the video? They said they will. We’re waiting. We haven’t heard from them yet. Something’s wrong. Moe Ya Thaw Myat Noe is coming back. This Sunday. Do we still need to wait for those guys? There’s not much time left. If they won’t give us… May Sue Maung What are you doing? Oh. Tracy, where have you been? Just somewhere nearby. Oh. Tracy, I have something to ask you. Yes My friends borrowed your apartment the other day? That’s right. Come on in. Sit, May Sue Maung. Yeah, they said it’s for a prank? Yeah. About that. I left first that day. Do you know when they left the place? I don’t remember. I did see you leaving with a taxi. They left soon after that. I even told them to return the key to my uncle. Three of them? Not sure. I handed the key to Nyein Thaw. What’s wrong with you? I’m leaving. What happened? Surprised that I said Nyein Thaw? Have a seat. They pulled a prank on you. No way. How do you know? They borrowed my place. Of course I’d know. They said Nyein Thaw really died. I don’t know. This has nothing to do with me. But I feel bad for you. There’s a lot that I know. You’re definitely being used. You’re gonna be in trouble. I don’t understand. Please explain this to me. Hello? Come to my house right now. Bring the video file. I called over someone. Everything will be clear when he’s here. What should I do? Do you trust me? Just do what I say. Act like you’re clueless. Someone dropped by a CD for you, sir. Leave it on the bed. Hello! Have you watched it? Who is this? You’ll see. In one hour, come to the Ferris wheel at Mya Kyun Thar. I don’t think I need to tell you why. Wait. Who are you? Hello? Hello? Hello! Aung Ye Htike. Why would we? How did this video show up? We don’t want to involved in this mess. Khay Mo is really scared, too. Nice to meet you. Sorry I’m late. Who are you? Let’s just talk about what matters. I want to make a deal with you. It’s not hard. Bring this video to its owner. The couple you ran into the other day. This is their sex tape. You have to bring this to them. Why are you doing this? What do you have against us? Nothing. It has nothing to do with you. But if you don’t do what I say… Alright. I’ll do it. So make sure the video of us doesn’t get out. Go give it yourself. Why drag us in? So that they won’t know I took that video. Say that you took it. Then everything will be fine. Their contact info… It’s fine. We have it. Then, I am going now. Don’t open the file, Bros. Anyone else home? They all went on a trip. I told them I didn’t wat to go and stayed. Tomorrow is your birthday, right? Yeah. But I don’t wat to do anything. You have to. Hold your birthday party. And invite them. No way. I don’t want to see their faces. You can’t be like that. You have to corner them here and ask them. Or it’ll be a problem for you. I don’t know it anymore. You have the proof. You have to make them admit to their actions. Then call the police. They killed your boyfriend. They put the blame on you. You have to get even. Hello. Mm. Of course. We’ll come. May Sue Maung… Take care. Bye! May Sue Maung invited us to her birthday party tomorrow. She’s having a birthday party? Yeah. We should go. Or she might get suspicious. This is it? Do you have other copies? We deleted everything. I came in person in case you doubt us. Nothing would have happened if you just give this to us the other day. Whatever. Keep your promise. Make sure no one knows about the body. If you guys do things right, things will get fun for you. What? Wait and see. Alright, you can go. I’ll check this file, if it isn’t the right one… Can I leave now? I’m sorry I had to do this. Did you get your video back? Don’t you worry. You’re still bitter at them, right? I just want them to admit it. A dead person can’t come back to life anyway. You’re wrong. They have to suffer for what they’ve done. Just keep that in mind. Hi! Unfaithful bastard. Myat Noe, What happened? Don’t touch me. Let me explain. - What do you want to explain? - Let me explain, babe. Please calm down. Let me talk. Don’t! Don’t touch me. - You guys are so unfaithful. - What? Please listen to me. I can explain, babe. Go away! DON’T TOUCH ME! Stay away from me! Happy Birthday, May Sue Maung. Happy Birthday, May Sue Maung. Happy Birthday, May Sue Maung. Tracy is also here. May Sue Maung invited me. I thought you’re not having this party anymore. I just… felt like it. We’re sorry it happened so close to your birthday. Let it be. We have to pay for what we did. What do you guys think we should do now? May Sue Maung! She’s here. It’s fine. She knows everything. Know what? Look… I’ll step out. What are you saying in front of an outsider? Yeah. We should be the only ones in this. She knows everything. I do, too. You guys are so brilliant. And so evil. How could you do that? What are you talking about? We didn’t do anything. Enough. We’re leaving. Let’s go. Dose leaving solve everything? Where did you get that? You said it’s me. That I’m the culprit. Cham Min Ye Htut. You’re so fucking rotten. And you two. Why aren’t you saying anything? Huh? Am I not your friend, too? I’m sorry. We didn’t want to do it. We have our own problems, that’s why. We don’t mean you any harm. Shut up. Cham Min Ye Htut Admit it if you did it. Why blame it on me? I’m so sorry. I… I’m scared of being arrested. And I have to study abroad. Your plan for studying abroad is that important? So my life doesn’t matter? - You all are so cruel. - It's not like that. We buried him in a safe place. No one will find out. We’ll just declare him missing. Fat chance. I’ll send all three of you to jail. Please don’t. May Sue Maung. I beg you. I don’t want to be arrested. Aung Ye Htike and I have nothing to do with this. It’s only because he’s paying us. You want money that much? Where’s your humanity? We just really need it. You also know about our situation. I… I… I’m pregnant. Khay Mo. You are… You… Still, how can you do this to me? You know my family disapproves of us. We need the money for the baby. So we had to resort to this. My friend! We won’t take that money anymore. Cham Min, take care of this by yourself. I’ll pay you back. Please don’t do anything to us. I don’t trust you one bit. May Sue Maung, I apologize. I was really wrong. I am selfish. I only cared about myself. I’m really scared of getting arrested. There must be other ways for us to solve this. May Sue Maung, here. Come on, you guys. Let’s talk this out. Don’t mind me. I’m aware of everything. May Sue Maung, you should calm down. You all are wrong. This incident is a result of your reckless behaviour. None of your business. You want to go to jail? We’re really sorry. I know that’s not enough. Cham Min and I are mostly blame for this. Khay Mo isn’t involved. I can’t think straight. I’ll think about what to do with you. First, tell me where you buried Nyein Thaw. And who are the people you gave his body to? We’ll tell you. My chest really burns. Yeah, mine too. I feel dizzy. May Sue Maung. You… Did you put in something? I didn’t do anything. Did you put anything in this? I can’t let anything happen to me… My baby… Khay Mo… Khay Mo… What did you do to us? What did you do? What did you do to us? I didn’t. Tracy… What happened? You… You are so evil. May! May! What’s wrong? Wake up, May! Wake up, May! Dude… What’s wrong with you guys? Tracy. What are you doing here? What’s wrong with them? Tracy. What have you done? I’m asking you. What have you done? What have you done? Mental Health Hospital Tracy. Is everything fine? Is there anything you want to tell me?
