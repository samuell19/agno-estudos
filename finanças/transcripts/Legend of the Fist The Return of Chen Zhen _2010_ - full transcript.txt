In 1914, World War I raged across Europe. British and French forces suffered heavy losses under the fierce German attack. In 1917, the Chinese government dispatched 150,000 workers, most without military training, to the front lines in Europe to fight alongside and assist the Allied Army. Each worker was given a copper wristband for identification. The scars left by these wristbands became a symbol of survival after the war. Sent into the field with little or no equipment, the Chinese workers not only had to survive on the battlefield, but also had to perform manual labor on the front lines. FRANCE, 1917 We need more men outside! We're out of ammo! Hurry! Move it! Tianyuan, don't be afraid. Stay cool. We will make it back to China. We won't die here. Don't be scared. We'll all run together. Don't look back...just keep moving! This is my amulet. It will protect you. Come on brothers, let's run for it. Charge! Charge! Hurry! The ammo is here, sir! Why are the French retreating? Chen Zhen! He") me! Chen Zhen! The Germans are coming! Watch out! Is everybody all right? Anyone hurt? Thank God for you, Chen Zhen. I'm fine, thanks to your amulet. God help us... I want to go home! Tianyuan. I want to go home. I'll kill you all. I want to go home. Take cover. We can't die here! At the end of World War I despite China's important role in the victory, she was ignored by the Allies. Japan occupied Qingdao in the Shangdong province. In 1925, Shanghai was divided into settlements. Under the facade of maintaining peace and order, Japan was increasing its influence, in preparation for an invasion of China. SHANGHAI, 1925 Master Liu. Liu Yutian: Shanghai tycoon Thank you. - Master Liu. - Have a good time. Boss, business is really booming here. You'd never know there was a war going on. It's total chaos outside. Where else can they go? My brother heard cannon fire in Shenyang. He says General Zhuo would defeat General Zeng. Rumor has it Zeng's forces are already fleeing. If Zhuo wins, perhaps China will be united. Not necessarily. Zeng is backed by the Japs. And the Brits certainly don't want to see a united China either. You're kidding. Have you been to Taiwan? The Japanese rule is so organized there. If you start trouble, they'll kill everyone, and then you won't be able to write your own history. Sooner or later, Taiwan will officially become part of Japan. China isn't ruled by the Chinese anyway. The winner will be either Japan or Britain. Just don't forget, the more trouble there is, the more money we'll make. Tell her to sing this song. Come on, let's go. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Who are you? What's your problem? Please calm down, officers. Tonight's on the house. Don't be upset... Please sit down. - Wen... - Yes, sir. I'm sorry, please sit down, Pardon me, Master Liu. You came from France? Correct. Let me buy you a drink. Thank you, Master Liu. Which is higher, two pairs or three of a kind? What do you have? Three of a kind. Then my two pairs beat you. Come on. Let's go on. Straight. I win. I win. Again. You're betting with your life? Can I do that? How much is your life worth? It can't be worth less than yours. What did you say? Is your life worth this much? Then I'm handing my life over to you. We'll see... Three of a kind. You're out of luck. I have two pairs. How can that beat three of a kind? Didn't someone just say two pairs beats three of a kind? You... - Right? - Sit down... OK. You set the rules, now live with them. OK. My friend, will you pay me back with your money or your life? I'd prefer money, if you don't mind. That's good, then. Let's drink. Come on, let's drink up. I've drank too much. I can't take anymore. Time to head back to the hotel. Forget the hotel. Move in here. It's rather simple, if you don't mind. Don't object or I'll be insulted. All right, thank you, Master Liu. You're here? Didn't you promise to save me this room so that I could watch the sunrise? It's three in the morning. You're here to watch the sunrise? Meet my brother, Qi Tianyuan. This is Kiki. You have more brothers than wives. What about me? Marry me, and you can do anything you want. And what about your other wives? They're passing clouds. You're here to stay. Then let's wait until they pass then. - Let's have a drink. - Next time. I've already had too much, but thanks. He drank too much. Let me... Well, I won't intrude any longer. I should go. Wen is downstairs. He'll drive you. Thank you. Your girlfriend is beautiful. Interested? Help yourself, but... she can be a handful. A handful for you perhaps, Master Liu? Right? Goodnight. Thank you, Master Liu. You're welcome. Why did you become Liu Yutian's new club manager? You'll be a celebrity overnight. It's too dangerous, too high profile. It's only a means to an end. No, getting Liu Yutian on our side is good. It's not easy to win his trust so quickly. Make good use of it. You really think Liu is up to any good? This tycoon has clout with the Triads. Besides, he's Chinese. We don't have enough resources. If we're going to fight against the Japanese, we need to motivate every Chinese we can. The more clout Liu has, the better for us. Infiltrating the Triads and the Municipal Police is essential to our movement. We've contacted the Chinese living in France. Don't forget about students like us. Every true Chinese person is ready to fight. It's a pity-- our country can't be united. Someday it will, I'm sure of it. Master, why did you set up the Jing Wu Athletic Association? To protect our home and country, Chen Zhen. "Jing Wu Athletic Association" FRANCE, 1917 Tianyuan, we're going home. Rest in peace. Tianyuan is coming back to China with us. Chen Zhen can't go home. But Qi Tianyuan can. China will be our war zone. HONGKOU DOJO Colonel Takeshi Chikaraishi: Japanese Army I've gotten word from the Casablanca Club that the Brits have gotten a hold of our dispatch schedule. Except for myself, only the three of you have seen it. Who did it? I don't know about them but I never left HQ. All Japanese soldiers... must be ready to die. Yes! Sisters, here comes the Boss. Cheers. Whose birthday is it? Doesn't matter, as long as you're buying. Very well. Drink up. Chris. The Boss is quite a popular guy. He's well connected in Shanghai. The one in white is Vivian. Come here. I have to step out right away. She's General Zeng's girl... keep an eye on her. He has arrived. Isn't he at war? He's here. He's at YQ Mansion. He just sent for me. Shall I get you a car? No, thanks. His chauffeur is picking me up. So haPPY- Have a drink before you go. Pour her a drink. Hey, Huang Ian. You have Red Haskels? Sorry, Kiki, I just sold out. Shall I go and get you some? Sure. Goodbye, Mr. Qi. Miss, the General is waiting upstairs. OK... Colonel, both General Zhuo and General Zeng are there. My men are in place, waiting for your order. - How are you, General Zhuo? - How are you? Long time no see. Please sit down. It's too cold. I'm treating us to a hotpot, so the two of us can have a good chat. General Zeng: Northeast Troops General Zhuo: Northeast National Army General if our armies go to war, which side do you think will win? Yours. If the Japs decide to support your dad, it could go either way. It'll be up to fate. My father is only exploiting the Japs. He's doing it at the sacrifice of principle! The Japs won't wait much longer. They're getting ready. You know they have mentioned a Manchu State. To be honest, I don't want to hurt the Northeast Troops, but I won't let them interfere with the unification of China. I'll be frank with you. If your father backs off and puts you in charge, I'll personally guarantee a ceasefire. What do you say? You're asking me to betray my father. Tell that to our fellow countrymen! General Zhuo, General Zeng tells me all the time that he trusts and respects you. Can't you trust him also? Tell your father that to avoid being the Japs' lapdog, he has only one option... peace talks. The Republic has come a long way. Her future depends on you and your father. I need time to convince him. Give me seven days. Very well. Seven days it is. If your old man won't listen, the next time we meet will be on the battlefield. We'll always be brothers. Drink up. Have a heart, sir. Stay back. Colonel. Please, sir! Protect the General! I think a superhero just blew our operation. Go away. What the hell? Who crashes into a police car? I'll be damned... Go take a look. Who? Me? Who else? I asked you to go. Me? Come here. Move away. Look at you! Seal off the area... check for survivors. - Look over there. - All right. Damn it! Who are you? The Masked Warrior. Why did you save my life? I didn't mean to, you little warlord. Tell that warlord father of yours to stop colluding with the Japs. A people's enemy will die a dire death. Did General Zhuo send them? No, this is beneath him. But who else knows you're here? Colonel, we support Commander Zeng. Why did we try to kill his son? I'm not helping Zeng get rid of Zhuo. But Tokyo ordered... It doesn't matter what Tokyo ordered. It matters what Tokyo needs. Internal strife among the Chinese people is good for us. If General Zeng is killed, his father will go to war with Zhuo. It was my mistake. I didn't expect a superhero to show up. Assassinations involve risks of failure. The key is to find out who this man is. Get on with it. The Masked Warrior is an icon of Japanese resistance. Don't let him bow out so soon. An extra identity is good for you. We'll run a report on him accordingly. Extra! Extra! Masked Warrior beats up Jap Assassins! Huachao, don't wear black all the time. People will think you're the Masked Warrior. Look who's talking! Who could be the Masked Warrior? I know who the Masked Warrior is. He's so fierce. Could it be you, Master Liu? He's either an escapee from a mental hospital, or someone from this club. Are you so sure? Everyone knows this place is the largest mental hospital in Shanghai. You better watch out. Don't get involved. Hey, the head of a mental hospital can't be afraid of mental patients. That's true. What have you done? Collecting dead bodies? You shouldn't trust the paper. It's not true! You know who was there? General Zeng. In fact, we got wind yesterday, there would be trouble at YQ Mansion. We went there to check it out. The place was crawling with people, 70 or 80 of them There were only ten. Fine, there were only ten. But someone started to shoot and I grabbed someone... You grabbed me. We took cover behind the car and returned fire. Then we split up. I took the left side, you the right. Bang...l took out three of them but then ran out of ammo. What could I do? I was out of ammo, too. I jumped from the car... and started to punch... You think I'm dumb as a pig? How do you explain the Masked Warrior? Listen to me. I began to fight. I didn't want to show off. I pulled down my hat, so nobody could see my face. They must have mistaken me for the Masked Warrior. You're the Masked Warrior? Look at yourself. You look more like the Masked Pig. No, not Chink...Chinese. This month's payment. Good. This will help me explain thins to the brass. Good. As long as we're here, you'll have cash to hand over every month. What are you looking at? Shall I buy you one? Lucky this wasn't on display last night, or you would be the Kinky Warrior. Stop messing around. I have a gun. A gun? Why didn't you come sooner last night? I was waiting for the right moment. I found what you asked me to. Those dead Japs had no identities. Who's behind this? How am I supposed to tell from... the dead bodies? General Zeng has left for the Northeast. What about that Vivian? That General is a true romantic. He put her up in the Glen Hotel. Where's the cash? Stay out of trouble and don't get me involved. Anyone suspicious at the Casablanca Club? There's a new partner. He looks suspicious. Go on. His name is Qi Tianyuan. He just returned from France. He was a laborer in the war in Europe. He hit it off with Master Liu right away and was made manager of the nightclub. What about you? My mission is to get close to Henry the Brit. There are so many people at Casablanca. I didn't notice him. I'll keep an eye on Qi Tianyuan. I'm sorry. Next time you make a report. Wait for your turn to speak. I'm sorry, Colonel. Vivian!! We're over here! I thought I'd never see you again. Vivian, we brought you these. Cosmetics and perfume... from Shanghai. - And this. - And this. Thank you. Thank you all. There you go. You asked me to bring these. These bracelets... One for me, one for you. They are from your mother. You're my best friend All right. Time to go. Get me a pack of Red Haskels. Yes, Kiki. Mister Qi. - Enjoy yourself. - Certainly. How dare you cheat in here! Kiki, your Red Haskels. Excuse Me. Cheers. Who's that foreigner with glasses? That's Henry. He's a British trader. He has clout at the American and British embassies. He's very well connected. Better than you? Yes, but only with the Brits. Here I come. Give me a hug... Don't drink so much. You scared everyone off. I want a half-day off. To do what? To go outwith him. You don't mind, do you? Not at all. Let's go. Kiki, you may not like where I'm going. You're afraid to bring me along? That's the general. They are fighting. Come on! Drink up! - Can I have a seat? - Who is it...? For you? Of course. Look who's here. Hey Chief! Come! Hurry up! This is Miss Kiki. Everyone, introduce yourselves. I'm Dagang- FuhaL Zhiyan. - Dabao. - Xiang. I'm Zhi. I'm Laixi. Hello. Chief, is this pretty lady your wife? Girlfriend. Miss Kiki, do you like Chinese white wine? You bet. Excellent. What do you do? How did you snatch him? I'm a hostess at Casablanca. A trendy girl. That's the most fashionable occupation in Shanghai. Brilliant. Cut it out. Let's drink up. Chief, I want to say something. I'm a little overwhelmed by your visit. I suggest we make a toast to our brothers who died in Europe. Let's toast to our dear brother and comrade... Chen Zhen. Enough with the past. Let's drink up. Zhishan. - Let me... - Thanks. - Kiki. - Hello. - My sister. - Your sister? You look nothing alike. Of course not. I'm better looking. Is the Chen Zhen you mentioned the one who barged into Hongkou Dojo and took out all the Japanese there? Yes. Wasn't he shot dead by the Japanese then? He wasn't dead. There were many rumors, but the Japs definitely did not kill him. He fought with us for 3 years in Europe. Chen Zhen was my brother. He's our brother, wasn't he? Yes. That's true. I have small eyes, but I can see very well. He was invincible on the battlefield! Really? He could run faster than a bullet. Drink up! Cheers. Cheers! Miss Kiki. This is for you. Thank you. I'll leave you alone. Does it look like me? Everyone here is so nice, and real. They don't have to grovel or pretend to be happy. I Wish I could live like this, too. True. Let me... - Baton, tiger, chicken. - Baton, tiger, chicken. Tiger. You lost. I let her win. Here we are. Thank you. Who are you? I'll shoot on three. One... Two... Three! You drank too much. I should go. Do you always carry a gun? Shanghai is a mess. Master Liu gave it to me for protection. So handsome. Can I have your autograph? Forget the autograph. Keep it. This will be my war trophy. Thank you. Who are you? Your real name. Fang Qing- Miss Fang Qing. The Northeast strategy must be completed soon. Tokyo wants it in 2 days. What about the Chinese relics? This map shows the distribution of relics in the Northeast. The Shang Dynasty oracle bones are valuable. Let's take as much as we can, destroy the rest. The land here is rich in resources. It's wasted on the Chinese. We should be running this country. Colonel, a classified document from Tokyo. DEATH LIST That's a lot of people to kill. To kill that many in a month is tough, even if the army moves in to help. They must die to make way for the dream of our Imperial Japanese Empire. Now, all we need is a leak. CLASSIFIED The people on this list... are all openly against the Japs. We can't publish this. It will only help the Japs create a panic in Shanghai. The Brits and the Yanks won't do anything to stop this? Did they interfere when the Japs occupied Shanghai? No. They watched from the sidelines hoping to get something out of it. Don't forget, our side won the war in Europe but the Allies still gave Qingdao to the Japs. They don't care about justice, they only care about what they can gain from it. Extra! "Japanese Death List intercepted!" This is a special report from Radio Shanghai. A Japanese Death List has been exposed. Hundreds of patriots are being targeted for assassination. Jack Taylor, John Haneke, Robert Wenders. Du Wenqiu, He Chang, Hu Zhiyong. Now that this death list has come out, what precautions are the police taking to keep these people safe? Sit down. I had a discussion with my boss this morning. We will closely monitor the situation as it develops. We will stay on top of it. It's not a problem at all. Don't give me that crap. I held your job once. A discussion with you boss... A discussion with your boss means shit! I run a nightclub now, and a lot of my customers are on this list. Do you know what that means for my business? Everyone is scared. If all my customers run off, what will I do? I need to know what the police are going to do about this. Will you protect the people on the list? Or are just trying to catch whoever circulated it? You are police officers. You should be maintaining order. Don't count on the Masked Warrior to do your job for you. That's all I have to say. Anyway, this is my partner, Qi Tianyuan. Qi, this is Inspector Huang. My pleasure, Inspector. I'm Qi Tianyuan. Huang Haolong. Boss, the Japs are here. We have a situation. Wait, come back, ladies. Sit over here. Here comes trouble. Colonel. Yamazaki-san, how are you? Long time no see. Have a smoke. I need women. Where are the women? I'm sorry. Hurry UP- Let me check it out. What are you going to do? Tell them to get lost. Where are the women? Right away. I'm sorry. - Where are the women? - What is it? See, the prettiest girl is here. You're a life-saver. Come. Pretty girl, come here. Come. Tell them this. No problem. Anything. None of the girls from Casablanca will sit at their table today. You'll get me killed, Miss Kiki. Tell him. Tell him. She said no girls will sit at our table. - What? - No... Please wait. - I'm so sorry. - Hold on. - What's going on? - Let's me She's gone. Sorry, I'm Qi Tianyuan. Nice to meet you. You're Master Liu's new partner, Qi Tianyuan? You're well informed. I'll sit with you. I'm more than well informed. I like to look things up. The man in this picture is also Qi Tianyuan. I've been looking for that. Thanks so much. No need to thank me. It's not hard to find this photograph. The hard part is deciding who the imposter is. Mr. Qi, do you know who the Masked Warrior is? I heard... it's a very nice film. It's been doing well at the box office. It's excellent. Have you seen it? Now that our death list has come out, do you think the Masked Warrior will interfere? Oh, you mean that Masked Warrior? Hmmm. Let me think about that. He Will. How about a wager? Let's bet whether more people on the list will be killed, or if more will be saved by the Masked Warrior. Shall we? What's the bet? One silver dollar. How nice of you to drop by, Colonel Chikaraishi. What are you playing? Flip the silver dollar? Have you met my new partner? A very interesting man. Why did you let him become a partner, This business is too small for the Japanese. On the contrary. Then open your own, get yourself a bigger place. You're not afraid we'll become enemies? If you manage to open yours, I'll close mine. On the Death List obtained from the Japanese, why are there names of foreigners... in addition to Chinese names? The list was a fake. Reports have the Japanese army making movements in Northeast China. Are you planning to invade China? Is Japan planning to start a second World War? The fact that I'm here is proof enough that the Japanese and Chinese are good friends. See, Master Liu and I are best of friends. We could never be enemies. I have to go. I'll be back when I have more time. Please don't come back, even if you have time. Mr. Chikaraishi, wait... You dropped something. That's mine, thank you. Feel free to drop by Hongkou Dojo. I will make sure to do that someday. Boss, everything is okay now. Okay? Now everyone thinks I'm a traitor. Is that okay? Cigarettes. "DEATH LIST PROVES REAL - LEADS TO MULTIPLE SHOOTINGS" Mr. Lam, you need to lay low in Hong Kong. Sure. Thank you, Masked Warrior. Fang Qing, I'll take you home. Why? You offended the Japs, remember? Many in Shanghai have offended the Japs. Can you protect them all? I'll try my best. Watch out. "KILLED" "SCHOOL PRINCIPAL KILLED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENT." Extra... "ASSASSINATIONS ADDING UP. IS THE MASKED WARRIOR BEATEN?" Dagang, tell the Chinese laborers to be ready to back up the student movement. Down with Japan. Save China! China is my home. Why should I run? Precisely because China is going to need you. For now, you should hide out for a while. We'll come for you when it's safe. Damn! You can't mug me! I have a gun somewhere! What's wrong with you? You have to start protecting these people! These intellectuals are defenseless! I went through the names on the list. They've mostly refused to leave. What else can I do? Scare them away! You're good at scaring people with your gun, right? Just shut up and leave like you were told. - What? - Just go. You have no right to do this. - Don't push. - I won't push. Go on. You people are ridiculous. Things can get more ridiculous. Want to see? Get into the car. Go. "FLED" Colonel. Since you leaked the death list, many on it have fled. Then half of our problem is solved. Move it... there's nothing to see. Freeze. 3 4 5 "DOWN WITH JAPAN" What are you doing? "KILLED" "PATRIOTS KILLED AND HUNG IN PUBLIC" "BRITISH BUSINESSMAN MURDERED" Have you considered leaving Shanghai? I've been away before. This time is different. I mean with me. Where to? Anywhere. When everything dies down. I'll take you away. Right now, I have things to sort out. There are so many problems in the world. How can you solve them all? If everyone chooses to flee, this country is finished. And without this country, we have no home. You're not afraid to die? Everyone dies. It's a matter of dying for something worthy. You agree? We must carefully manage the way the fleet enters the harbor. There needs to be a safe distance between the warships. It's time we showed our strength. Against the Chinese army, numbers are not the issue. We're much stronger than the Chinese dogs. Yes! How about a wager? You like to write? Go ahead. Write! See if you can write anymore. Chen Zhen, don't give up. Chen Qiang of the Shanghai Times is dead. There's more up there. Nobody's alive. Search more carefully. Your kid brother is dead. The man who taught me this song died in Europe fighting for his country. Even today, our people are still dying. Long live. "The Japanese army attacks in the Northeast!" "General Zhuo has been cornered!" Our reinforcement troops have been cut off, and Zhou's troops are out of ammunition. We must unite. Down with the Japanese. Down with the Japanese! Save China! That's a lousy idea. What you said is useless. Where can we get that many guns? Don't be reckless. We're going to need a lot of ammo. It will need to be a quick victory. It simply doesn't work. We must go in for the kill. Kiki, your Red Haskels. Thank you. Do you have something to tell me? One lump, two lumps. No cream, right? What do you really do at Casablanca? I'm a hostess. Are you looking down on me now? Why did you ask me when you know the answer? You don't smoke. Why did you always ask Huang Ian for cigarettes? I don't know what you're saying. I wish you weren't working for the Japanese. Don't ever come back, or I'll have to kill you. Let me go. Don't hurt Kiki. I'm the General's girlfriend. He'll do anything you ask of him. Leave Kiki out of this. Do you understand? Don't be scared, Kiki. They only want to get to the General. You think you know her? You don't. Her name is not Kiki. Her name is Yumi Yamaguchi. She's Japanese. What are you doing? Doihara has Kumoko, who you know as Huang Ian. I have her. They are all excellent spies. Don't harm her. She's with the General. She'll be useful as a hostage. Using a woman for blackmail... is beneath me. We will use her to create a conflict. Since Zhuo opposes Commander Zeng's cooperation with us, he has Zeng's son's woman assassinated. Yumi Yamaguchi, this is your new mission. Congrats, Captain Yamaguchi! Well done. I'll report the good news to headquarters. Excuse me. I'm Huang Haolong of the Municipal Police. What do you want? I'm here to see the Colonel. Woman. So many? Chen Zhen sent me here, but he looks like a no-show. There are 3 points to our plan. The first point is time. We absolutely must come back here at the exact same moment. The second point is still time. The danger multiplies every second we're in there. The third point is still time! Hold this. Hurry up. What's the matter? Follow us right away. I'm the inspector. I stand watch. You're garbage. Catch it. Go. What is he doing here? He's an enemy of our Army. All Chinese are enemies of our Army. How many do you plan to snatch? Did you find out anything? No. Chen Zhen, you're too careless. You once killed a Tsuyoshi Chikaraishi at the Hongkou Dojo. This man was my father! "SICK MEN OF EAST ASIA" Chinese are not sick men of East Asia. Chinese are not sick men of East Asia. Colonel, there's trouble at headquarters! Let him go. I'll take him on at the dojo. I shall avenge my father's death. Hurry. The Japs are here. Let's go! Hurry, hurry! Hurry up, hurry! Let's gm! That way. Quickly! Over here. Get in the car! Hurry. Stop! Stop! Where's the bomb I gave you, asshole? Game over, Chen Zhen. Mr. Qi! Give me a hand. Kill them all. You're Chen Zhen's sister. You, I won't kill. Come on! Inside! Step aside. Step aside. You stay here. You come with me. Back off. There's nothing to see. Wake up, comrades. Fight the Japanese. Remember our national humiliation. Boycott Japanese goods. Wake up, comrades. Fight the Japanese. Remember our national humiliation. "This is a special report from Radio Shanghai." "General Zhuo was ambushed by the Japanese and has been defeated." "30,000 troops were wounded or killed." "The Northeast National Army is retreating." You've been sleeping like a log. That's brilliant. How can you sleep at a time like this? I thought I was an irresponsible asshole. But you beat me. You've been sleeping. What time is it? It's a mess out there. Wake up. Don't count on me. I can't do this. Aren't you Chen Zhen? Wake up! Fight the Japanese. Remember our national humiliation. Boycott Japanese goods. Wake up, comrades. Remember our national humiliation. Boycott Japanese goods. Stop shouting. What's the point of these slogans? Go home. Go home. That's Japanese turf over there, I can't help you once you cross. Who needs you? We don't need help from a cop. You work for the foreigners. You don't represent the Chinese people. Besides taking bribes, what else do you know? Watch your mouth. Stay where you are. Don't shoot! Who opened fire? Stop it! Don't Shoot! Stop. You did nothing to stop their armed insurrection. Now you expect me to let them go? Think! Where do a bunch of students get guns? Someone else must have started the trouble. The students must be convicted. Otherwise, what will I tell the Japanese? Why do you need to tell the Japanese anything? We're in the British settlement. You're useless. You want to quit? This is China. It's you guys who should fuck off. I hate you white-skinned pigs shoving your fingers in my face every day. If I tell the brass how much you're taking from me each month we'll see who has to fuck off. You're nothing but a dog. Without us, can you be so comfortable? Without us, can you wear a new suit every day? Can you stay in this job for so long? Tell the Japanese? You tell them shit. What? Cat got your tongue? You don't understand? Then I'll say it in English. You're absolutely useless. I'll tell you...China has been around for thousands of years. Foreigners are always coming in and trying to bully us. But in the end, they're only able to do one thing: fuck off. Bravo! Release the students. He's waking up. He's really waking up. Zhen. He's waking up. Doctor. Come. Laixi, Fuhai, Changman and Dabao... They hanged them one by one before our eyes. That's what the Japs want. That's what they want us Chinese to see. What now? When I got there, Qi Zhishan was already... Don't worry. I'm fine. I really am fine. Extra! General Zhuo defeated! Japs and Zeng defeated General Zhuo! He and his wife are dead. And the Death List... Those on the list are either dead or gone. We have lost. Let it go. The two of us can't save the world. Brother. Is this Kiki? I must be mistaken. You haven't been to work. I've been worried. You look nice in this uniform. I'm Captain Yamaguchi of the Japanese Army. Miss Captain. Merry Christmas. I'm here on behalf of the Japanese Army. I hope you can help us find someone. One of mine? We don't know. His name is Chen Zhen. Isn't Chen Zhen dead? We arrested his accomplice Dagang. What if I can't deliver him? To protect our subjects, we have already expanded the area of our settlement. We are ready to bring in the troops. In other words, if I can't deliver him, you'll find an excuse to attack, right? Can you shoulder this responsibility? You're out of bargaining chips. You. And you. What's going on? Sit. Now I have my bargaining chips. Master, why did you set up the Jing Wu Athletic Association? To protect our home and country, Chen Zhen. Chen Zhen will prevail. Long live Jing Wu. Chen Zhen will prevail. Long live Jing Wu. I've been waiting for you. Nothing has changed in 10 years. There's no need to change. We Japanese are born strong. Then the outcome will be the same, you will lose. Did the electric shocks make you crazy? You promised to spare him. Captain Yamaguchi, you know I never spare those who oppose the Army, including him... and you. If you prefer Fang Qing over Yumi Yamaguchi, go ahead and be Fang Qing. Chen Zhen. Women are only sex toys for men. Just like Fang Qing and Qi Zhishan. Listen, you people! Chinese are not sick men of East Asia. Stop. Stand down, everyone. Leave him to me. Sentimentality is only for the weak. Chen Zhen. I overestimated you. Come on. You piece of crap. What now? Come on. We will go back to China. Run for it! Run! Our war zone will be in China. If we unite, no country... and no one can bully us. I asked you to protect those people. We've lost. Let it go. Protect our country. Aren't you Chen Zhen? Wake up! Open your eyes. Welcome, Captain Kawashima. Salute. "The Chinese resistance movement persisted as the Japanese invasion continued."
