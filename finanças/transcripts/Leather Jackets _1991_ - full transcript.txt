[Claudi] It's hard to think that something as simple and easy to say as, "I love you" can be such a problem. You have to be careful who you fall in love with. The three of us have always known each other and maybe... Well, maybe we should have stayed just friends. For them friendship is everything. [man] Thanks a lot. Oh! Good morning, Mom. [speaking foreign language] [indistinct chatter] [both laugh] [grunting] Where's the fucking money? Where's the fucking money? Give us the fucking money! Look at him, man! Give us the fucking money? Come on, asshole. Give us the fucking money. Give us the fucking money! Motherfucker, I'll fucking blow your fucking head off! Get the fucking money, man! What do you think I'm some fucking idiot? Give us the fucking money! Hey! [screams] [people gasping] [both exclaiming] Fucking great! Get outta here! Look at all of this! What is this? Fucking lunch? [Anthony] Move! Move! [Sammy] Shoot! Shoot the fucker! Shoot! [Sammy laughing] [indistinct shouting] [groans] Get off of me! Get in the car! Anthony's been shot. Get in! Get in! Come on, hommie, get in! Did you get it? Fucking eh! [alarm hooting] Ha! [man] Good luck in LA, man. Take care of yourself. So long, suckers! [waiter] No, no. No more drinks. You're outta here. We'll have a New Year's drink, okay? We could be in LA by tonight. LA? Yeah, sure, why not? I'll tell you why not, you idiot. Because if the cops see that we're not around, we might as well tell them we did it now. That's why not. What about the money? What about the money? Let's just leave here and split it up now and get the shit over with. Because this shit isn't over yet. Why'd you bring this shit for brains anyway? What happened to Mickey? Mickey's retired. Look, why don't you just give me my end of the cut and I can go home? Who the fuck put you in charge, huh? Huh? Hey, assholes. Aren't you a little old to be juvenile delinquents? Hey, pups! What's your pleasure? And where the fuck are you going? I'm gonna go take a shit! Maybe this one I'd like to wipe my ass while I do it. [laughing] Hey. [waiter] What can I get you? Let me make you up something special, something like, with a cherry in it. -Hey, how you doing? -Good. My name is Sammy, Sammy Sperm, and this is my good friend Dobbs. You wanna see what I can do? Watch this. Wanna see? [moaning] [girl scoffs] Can you do that? He can do that, too, I bet. Give it a try. -For the girls. -No, no, I'll let you do it. [laughing] [knock on door] [Mickey] Hi, Mrs. Little. Mickey! What beautiful flowers. What are you doing here? I'm here to see Claudi. -I'll get her for you. -Okay. Hello, stranger. [Mickey] Hello, you. What are you doing here? Admiring the view. Are you angry with me? I'm never angry with you. What about this morning? What about this morning? You didn't even say, "Hi." You were very busy with the guy in the nice car. Were you jealous? I wanted to kill him. He was just giving me a ride home. How do you like the flowers? They're from you? They're beautiful. What's going on, Mickey? Do you want a date or something? I want you to marry me, Claudi. [whispering] What? I want you to marry me. I'll marry you, Mickey. I've waited for the longest time for you to ask me. Nobody else could take me, honey. I wouldn't want to go with anybody else. I'll go anywhere with you, Mickey. Great. -When do you wanna do it? -Soon. [both chuckle] Let's... Let's do it now. Let's drive down to Las Vegas. Let's just do it. Yeah, I got a job in LA. We'll leave tonight. It was always you. [Claudi laughs] [Claudi moaning] Hello again, Mrs. Little. It's okay, Mom. We're getting married. [Dobbs] Hold on a second. All right, where is he? -The motherfucker split! -What! He's a gutless fuck. -He's got no balls. -Fuck! He's probably copping a plea right now. No, no, no. Let's face it. Come on. We gotta go. No. Carl's too scared to do anything like that. He slam dunks us down the toilet, he hits the shit hardest. Just relax. Talk to the girls. Hey, how you doing? Listen, I've been dying to ask you one question, okay? These, these beautiful round breasts, are they real? [girl] Oh, God! I have a question for your friend. What do you with this? Oh, you'll find out. -[chuckling] -Will I? Yes, you will. [man 1] What have we got here? [man 2] One of Dobbs' boys. Looks like the fish liked this guy. Okay, tag him and take him back to the morgue. This Dobbs seems to be losing his friends. Tron, my man. Smoke? Nice shoes. Hold on. All right, Carl Richards, 1412 Ocean Boulevard, apartment seven, wife and daughter. Sam Wilder, 27 Philard Avenue, parents. Daniel Dobbs, whereabouts unknown. Punish him good. Anthony Bennet, dead. Easy. That's good. Thank you for shopping at Ralphs. [door creaks] [billiard balls clacking] Hey, we're closed. The door was wide open. Come back tomorrow, huh? Maybe I ain't thirsty tomorrow. Hey, get outta here, will you? There's other bars down the street. Well, from the outside this place looked kind of quaint to me. Go ahead, give him a drink. Don't touch none of the food. Thanks for the warning. "Bon voyage, Mickey." Where's he going? Away. What for? He got a job. What do you want? Well, I'll have a straight Scotch. You and your buddy have whatever you want. This guy wants to buy you a beer, you want it? As long as he don't expect me to suck his dick. You ain't worth a whole beer, son. How about I reach across this bar and break your fucking jaw, asshole? Steve! Steve, he's a cop. Well, here I thought I had you fooled there for a while. Not even that long. What are you doing here? I'm looking for Daniel Dobbs. I heard he operates out of this barn. The only thing he operates is a jukebox. Come on, this is like his second home. He been hanging around the house lately, Mom? He was in around noon. [man] Is that right? Tell Dobbs I was here. What do you want him for? A certain Vietnamese social club is looking for him and his buddies. Vietnamese, huh? Ain't we had a war with the Vietnamese? That's right, genius. For these guys it ain't over yet. It's just over here. [indistinct chatter] [in Vietnamese] [in English] So, what brings you out tonight? What's the celebration? Oh, this? This is what you'd call a war party. Better send the boys home before you start one. A man under my protection was killed by four Americans. Let the police deal with them. Hey, fuck the cops! Most of the cops were soldiers in our country. Do you think they'd give a shit about a gook killer? Be reasonable. Are you willing to risk more lives to kill these men? I've a list of the police suspects. You're gonna use that to hack up the Americans? It's my party. [Carl] Would you fucking look at me when I talk to you? If the cops come around and they ask about where I was or anything, you just tell them I was here with Tammy, you and Tammy the whole day. You got that? You understand that? [woman] Can you please help me out here? Can you please help me out here? Now, you do what I tell you! You understand? You tell them that! You hear me? What do you want me to tell everyone? They don't even come here anymore. They don't give a shit. They know that I fucking lie all the time. So you better find yourself a new alibi, because I'm finished with you. [Carl] Did you get the fucking money? Where is it? [woman] I don't have any money. Bullshit! I don't have any money! You fucking lie to me and I'll tear your fucking head off! Jesus Christ! I don't have any fucking place to go! [Carl shouting] [Carl shouting] Oh, fuck! Come on, man, I've got a kid. [Mickey whistling] Where are you going? We're going to a party. I thought we were going to LA. We'll just pop in and say goodbye to the guys, okay? Sure. [laughing] Hey, Ginger, what's your friend's name? It's Julie. Julie. Julie. Right, Julie. Hey, Julie, you wanna to go out? No, no, no, no, no! -Hey, they're our dates. -No. No. We ought to take them out. They've been with us all day. So, where do you wanna go? God damn it, no. It's stag night, honey. [chuckles] You don't wanna go there. [Julie] It's not like watching pigs in their own shit? That's right. [Ginger] Someone should see that. Hey, see? Do these girls look like they're easily offended? They're students, for Christ's sakes! Hey, Julie, give me some of those pills. You'll have fun. You'll like it. [Julie chuckles] [Ginger] So, where you taking us? To Fat Jack's. [Julie] Mmm. To a gathering of the clan. You are invited. [soft music playing] I just can't believe this is happening. It's like a dream or something. I feel like you should pinch me and wake me up. Well, I don't wanna do that. It's gonna be really scary. You don't have to be scared if you're with me. Big guy. The song's over. You want some champagne? Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey! -Hey, Steve. -Hi, Steve. Say goodbye to Mickey. -Bye, Mickey. -Bye. [giggling] Bye. Hey, if you ever get tired of this guy, why don't you, uh, get hold of my number? Is she does get inclined, his number's right on the toilet wall. [chuckles] See you later. Bye. Thanks, Steve. See you. [Steve] Baby, you'll get that boy killed. Okay... What's the matter with you? We just got engaged two hours ago and you're already making passes at other people's bimbos. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let's... Let's go home. Well, no, I can't just leave the guys. Why not? Well, it's... [chuckles] I mean, don't you want to announce the engagement? Well, not here, really. Not now, anyway. Oh. Let's just... Let's just go, be alone. Take me home. Anything you say. Come on. Hey, Mickey, where the fuck were you today? Working. Where were you? -Same old shit. -Go get a life. Hey, where the fuck are you going? Taking Claudi home. Oh, you think you're lucky? We got engaged tonight. Check it out. Big deal. Come on, let's get out of here. Hey, you don't wanna go, do you? What is this? A fucking toll? Look, I was just waiting for an excuse to leave anyway and you just breezed in. [both chuckle] I want to congratulate you on your impending nuptials, but knowing you, you got them out of the way already. What the fuck is this? [softly] Come on, Mickey, just take me home. Yvette, give me a beer. Make that two. Uh... Give me a scratch. [groans] Can you believe that asshole? Getting engaged? I think it's very romantic, they make a nice couple. Yeah, like dumb and ugly. Oh, that reminds me. You and me, we're gonna have a little talk. No, later, man. No, not later, man. Let's do it now. Otherwise I might have to smack you around in front of your little friends. Man, if you were 20 years younger I might let you take a crack. If I was 20 years younger, I would be pimping your ass for a buck a pop, and we wouldn't be having this conversation. Now, let's move. All right, all right, man. Anything to make you happy. I love you, you know that. All right, what's the fucking deal? Fucking hell! What's your fucking problem, man! You nearly killed me! I'll do better next time. Have a seat. Make yourself comfortable. I mean, what's the fucking deal? Huh? You're starting to annoy me. Well, excuse me. Hey, shit for brains. I know what came down. I had cops crawling over me all day. Oh, yeah? Well, what'd you tell them? I covered. I said you was here. Uh-huh! That's mighty wise of you, Jack. [chuckles] I take it that there's a price on this little act of friendship. I figured that all the money that you got from the slant would alleviate my embarrassment. That's quite a lot for a little, a little lie. Don't you think? Consider it the cost of living. [chuckles, coughs] What is this? This? This is nothing. This... This is advice. I want all the money. Okay, okay, you're right. You're right. You gave me an alibi, you deserve a cut. The only cut I think you should be thinking about is fillet of Dobbs served in all the finest trash cans around the city. You think I'd be stupid enough to carry it around on me? Well, you better tell me where it is... Or I'm gonna blow your kneecaps out the other side of your legs. I gave it to Carl. You wouldn't trust Carl to take a piss if you sewed his fingers to his dick. I ain't got it. [chuckles] You know... Lying is gonna get you into a lot of trouble. You're gonna lose all your friends. [grunts] [sighs] [groaning] [Fat Jack coughing] All right, everybody, listen up! Dancers are here! [people cheering] [upbeat music playing] Look who's here, man! Hey, how you doing? What's your name? -Bree. -Bree. And you must be... -Connie. -Connie. How you doing? Well, can we help you with something? I don't think so. Not unless you got our money. Money? You didn't get paid already? Well, I don't know. I don't think... Do you have any money on you, Steve? -That's all you got? -I'm outta here! Wait! Wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We've got some money. -I don't know, let me look. -How much do you need? You owe us 200 bucks. Two hundred. Here it is. Hey, where'd you get that, man? I inherited it, all right? -We gotta change. -Shit! Well, don't you do that on stage? We have to get into our costumes first. Can we use the apartment? What time are we leaving? Midnight. So that doesn't leave you much time for your party. Oh, you're trying to get rid of me now? No. No, I'm not. [sighs] It's just that you wanna go and... Go! Be a kid one last time, you know. Just, do me a favor. What's that? -Don't get pregnant. -[snickers] Go. Go. Have fun. [upbeat music playing] Hey, Mickey, how you doing? Hey, girls, this is the guest of honor. Not only is he leaving tonight, but he also got engaged. [Both] Congratulations. Hey, hey, Steve, take care of the girls, huh? -[Steve] Yeah, yeah. Okay. -I'll be back later. What kind of shit was that over there? What shit? I don't like you talking to Claudi that way. Hey, come on. Relax. Come on. I've had a hard day. Come on, sit down. Have a drink. What do you want? What do you want? Bourbon. Double bourbon, Yvette. Go ahead give him one. [Yvette] Here you go. Here's to you, pal. May your bed be blessed with clean sheets and dirty women. [man] Yeah, watch your shoes, Tommy. [Tommy] $250 shoes. It's nice work. She's sweet, sexy and dead. Let's see what else we got. So my bilirubins are okay, my triglycerides are okay. Blood pressure's a little high. -The alcohol. -One forty over 90. Shit! Make that three body bags. Where in the hell is the head? It'll turn up, Tommy. It'll turn up. [Dobbs] Ah, you play pool like you fuck. You never learn. Say your prayers, wabbit. -Shit! -Ha! [blows raspberry] -Say good night, Gracie. -[Mickey] I can't beat you. Here's to the last 20 years. Twenty years! Has it been that long? -I believe it has. -Fuck. Now you're just going to retire from life. It's a god job, pal. -Building walls, right. -Hey, Mickey. Hey! Beats stealing bikes and chasing cheerleaders. Oh, man, you think there's some kind of virtue working for a living? You wouldn't last five minutes. [exhales] Get real, man. There's sharks and vultures out there. What the sharks don't eat, the vultures get. You think they're gonna leave you any scraps? You're prey, asshole. You're not even entertainment. You should've stayed a thief. I was never a thief, Danny, I was just dumb. If you told me about something we could steal, I'd do it. If I felt like it. But I never did anything to make you happy. I did it because it was fun and because you are my friend. But it's hard being your friend, Danny. You make life difficult. -[scoffs] Oh, really? -Yeah. -Let me ask you something. -Shoot. Did you ask Claudi to marry you just so you could fuck her? You don't get it. You don't get it. She makes me happy. Happy? Happy. But, she scares me. She... I'm scared somebody's gonna take her from me and then I won't be happy anymore. That's cute. But you know what other guys are gonna think? I don't care what other guys think. They're gonna look you right in the eye and they're gonna say, "I fucked your wife, asshole." And they won't even have to move their lips. You know what I think? I think she's like me. I think she took what she could get. How about all she could get? Look at you. You're the cheapest whore I've ever seen. Oh, come on, we're guys. Chicks can't be like us. Sure they'd like to be. I mean who ever said they could fuck around? Not their moms that's for sure. Dogs and whores invented that. And Claudi... Claudi took to it like a fly to shit. Knock it off now, all right? You just don't get it, do you? Dobbs, I wanted you to be my best man. Oh, you don't want that. You know why? I fucked the bride this morning. -Hold still. -Grab him. What did you say? I fucked her in her own bed this morning. [muffled screaming] Easy, easy. It's your party. You can cry if you want to. [laughs] [blues music playing] [crowd cheering] [crowd chanting] Go! Go! Go! [indistinct chatter] Dobbs. Take it off. [yelling] Shit! This is a fucking waste of time. They're not gonna be here. They're not that fucking stupid. Don't be so sure. Come on, we're on overtime, it's a private party. Let's just crash it. Hey, Mickey, what the fuck! [grunts] You're not even worth it. Can't you take a fucking joke? Oh, Mickey! You're no fun, you know that? You're no fun! Shut up! Shut the fuck up! [music stops] Daniel Dobbs? That's my name. You're in deep shit, Son. Me? We just fished Anthony Bennet out of the drink. [people screaming] [man] He's on the stage! Go! Jesus! [screams] [piano plays] [Mickey] Dobbs, over here! [grunting] [gunshots] [tires screeching] [brakes squeal] You having fun yet, Mickey? -Shut the fuck up. -[gun cocks] [sirens wailing] [inaudible] [distant gunshots] Who the fuck were those guys? Tongs? What, Triads? What am I here? An authority on slopes? The cops said they're Vietnamese. What'd you do to piss them off, Dobbs? Carl capped a slant at work today. Are you fucking kidding me? You know what you're dealing with here? These guys got a weird honor code and shit. They don't just fucking kill you, they kill everybody you've ever fucking met! -Hey, you pissed up the wrong leg this time, Dobbs! -Hey, hey, hey! Why don't you come up with something positive for once? Hey, wait a minute! Are we friends what? Come on, man, we gotta stick together, we gotta find a way out of this. -Come on. -I don't fucking believe this! I say we go to L.A. Let's go to fucking Disneyland. What, are you smoking crack? Or are you a fucking moron all the time? Hey... Come on. Come on. What're you gonna do, leave me here? Go ahead. Fuck! Fucking Dobbs. -He's shot, man. -I know. I'll take you to L.A., okay? I'll take you. But when we get there, I want you to do something for me. What? I don't ever want to see you again. Yeah, sure. Fine. [Steve] I tell you, it's a damn good thing them Vietnamese can't see out of them beady eyes of theirs. [Mickey] Come on, let's go. [Steve] I got around the freeway the other day, one of them Vietnamese was stopped dead in the fast lane, put his blinker on trying to get into the right hand lane. -Come on! -[Dobbs] No, shit! -[Steve] Now, that's a Vietnamese for you. -[Dobbs] Yeah. I don't want Claudi involved in this, so just be fucking quiet, all right? We get in the car and we go. I'd like a beer. -Don't slam the door. -It's a good idea. Hey, hey, don't go over there. Hey! [doorbell buzzing] That's enough! She's cool. Hey, Claudi! Oh, hey, how you doing? -Boy, we sorry. -What is he doing here? We got a problem. -What's going on? -Where's your mother? She's upstairs. Dobbs is in trouble. I gotta take him to L.A. What about us? I'll send for you later. Jesus, Mickey. So, are you coming, too? I ain't got nothing here. What about your family? What about them? What am I gonna do? Carry them my whole life? You can tell her. We're going to Disneyland, right? Right? Yeah. It's not all right. She's not going. [Dobbs] Why don't you let her decide? Why don't you shut up now? Hey, honey, you got any tequila in the house? Can't you control your friend. I'd have to shoot him. [Claudi] Jesus, Dobbs, you're bleeding! No shit! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Shit! Look at that man! Wasted! Shut up, you're lucky to be alive! We gotta get you to a hospital. That's the first place they'll look. It's better to be busted than to bleed to death! That's easy for you to say. Steve, check it out, man. You can see it. [chuckling] [coughing] Ow! Never touch me again. I was only trying to say thank you. Don't you just love her when she's mad? Hey, Steve. Got a light? [coughs] You asshole! [grunting] Oh, God! Go to a hospital! [groans] Don't you want to take care of me? I'll look after you. And who'll look after you? [chuckling] Let's go. Come on, let's go, come on. [chattering] -You know... -[laughing] I'd shoot you in the head. Right between the eyes. -Get in there, you bastard. Get in there. -Isle seat! Oh, man, you don't know how to throw a party. All right, you better not lose that key, huh? [grunting] Okay, easy, easy, easy! [Steve] Isle seat! Son of a gun. Son of a gun. [Dobbs] Okay, don't wake me up. Why don't you keep quiet back there? We ought to get going. [Steve] Ay, caramba! [Steve and Dobbs laugh] Shut up! What's wrong? Why aren't you talking to me? Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What? The gun! Put it down. I can stick it in my bag. Just be still. What's going on, Officer? May I see your drivers license, registration, and proof of insurance, please? -It's in the thing, yeah. -Glove box? Get out of the car. The keys to the automobile. Hand it to me. Step back. [officer] Where are you kids going? Vegas. We're gonna get married. I don't have the key to the trunk. I lost it. A couple of lovebirds. He give you a ring yet? Yeah. Diamonds. Congratulations. Thank you. You have a safe trip. [coughing] Jesus Christ! [Steve] Oh, man! Did you fucking get scared back there or did something crawl up your ass and die, man? Hey, where the fuck are you going? Hey! Hey, asshole, I'm talking to you. Fuck you and your dumb car. Fuck you, too! What a dick. [coughs] Which way? Where the fuck are we anyway? This way or that way? Oh, that's good. Can you tell me about this morning? What about this morning? You lied to me, you whore. I didn't lie to you. Fucking Dobbs! Why? What makes him so special? Dobbs? Honey, I look at Dobbs and I think of a lower form of life. Is that why you fucked him? Don't you lie to me! How are any of those guys good for you? What do you need? How can any of that add up to a good time? It doesn't. Bullshit! And all the time you were entertaining these guys, I'm waiting! I'm waiting! You live half a block away from me and you never bothered to notice that I'm in love with you! What, it's me? Well, what about you? Where were you? Why didn't you say anything? I was nervous! About what? About me? I don't understand! You don't fucking get it! I was in love with you! I was in love with you, and I was embarrassed! But now, I can't be with you! Why not? Because you're all used up. Everyone has to have an agent in Hollywood. Even stuntmen? [snickers] Are you kidding? How do you think we're gonna get an agent? Trust me. [exhales] Where are you taking me? Where you belong. Hey! -Hey! -[Mickey] Hey! [car passes by] Mickey! Cheer up, sport. You're gonna like Disneyland. We didn't expect you back so soon. [door shuts] We made a deal. You wanna drive? [grunts] He's bringing us closer together. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Ain't that sweet. [engine revs] [mints clattering] So I take it, the engagement's off. What? No big day? Huh? Why did you tell Mickey you fucked me this morning? I was doing him a favor. By lying? It was just a little lie. You asshole. I mean, when was the last time we fucked, honey? You remember? I don't remember. What're you looking at me like that for, you ungrateful bastard? You obviously couldn't dump her on your own. I never needed your help. Oh, who are you kidding? I made you.22 You're just my shadow. You're nothing but a grunt. You ain't never gonna be me. Thank you, God. Blessings in disguise. Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Who the fuck asked you? Come on, let's face it, Dobbs. Between erections, you're just killing time with the rest of us. -DOBBS: Is that right? -Yeah, that's right. You don't have any friends. All you have is an audience. The only thing you ever shared with anybody else is your dick. If not the dick itself, stories about the dick. And the stories are getting boring. Oh, now that you've opened your fat mouth, why don't you entertain us? You wouldn't be interested. Oh, I don't know. Why don't you tell us about the pump brothers? You'll love this one, Mickey. All those balls you stuck up your ass? What were they called? Moo cow? Ben Ho? Ben Wa. Ben Wa, that's it. Yeah, Ben Wa. You remember it better than I do. That's enough. Oh, come on. Come on, Claudi. Don't be... don't be shy. You can tell it a lot better than me. You remember all those little... slimy details? What's your problem, Dobbs? I mean, what bothers you? Is it that I fuck guys? Is it that I suck cock? I mean, are you jealous? What is it? You wish, honey. Hey, Steve, you awake back there. [grunts] You don't want to hear this. Why not? See? Now we're all interested. Even Mickey. All right, so where do you want me to start? Ben Wa. -[chuckles] Wait. -That's enough! -That's enough! -You should've spoken up when you had the opportunity there. -I'm speaking up now! -Well, it's too late now. Maybe you need to hear it. Okay, so, let's start with Big Steve here. He's a sitting duck. Just leave me the fuck out of this. Oh, yeah, all right, well, did he tell you about our night passion? When I got drunk and he fucked me in my sleep. Boy, I bet that made a great story when he told it. You weren't drunk, baby. [both laughing] Right, well, a friend of mine was there and she just happened to notice I was unconscious and that it took you a full 30 seconds. Hey, you were cum drunk. [both laughing] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We got all that bullshit. Tell about the pump brothers. That's the one. Well... I couldn't decide which one I liked better, so I had them both. We were in their parent's room, and there was this string of pearls, and Will asked me if I knew who Ben Wa was and I said I didn't, so he introduced me. And... And it was fun, and I liked it. And I liked them. You know, if I liked a guy I was proud of it, you know, I was proud of myself. Didn't mind showing him off. I didn't mind. I was loyal to him for as long as he was loyal to me. And I never stood for cheats and liars. Not even you. I never lied to you, honey. You made me think you cared. That was your idea. Shall I... Shall I tell the boys about us? Sure, why not? Why not. Into each life, a little Dobbs must fall. When I first met Dobbs, he was wearing exactly the same thing, except for the blood. And... He was a snake. But he was a cute snake. And he asked me out on a date, so I let him take me out. He took me to Fat Jack's. It was the first time I'd ever been to Fat Jack's. And we had fun and we wound up in the men's room. [chuckles] And I told him to fuck me right there and he said, "No." He said... He said I was special. He wanted it to be different. So, he borrowed some money and he took me to a hotel in Frisco with brass beds and soft sheets and the place smelled like jasmine... And... He undressed me. And I've never been that naked before. [scoffs] Nobody'd ever really made love to me before. [chuckles] I remember... I remember how safe I felt. I felt really safe, you know. All your heat, you just kept lavishing it on me. You just kept pouring it all over me and I got... I got really scared, you know. And you said, "Shh, it's okay. Don't worry, I'll take care of you. "I'll take care of you, everything's gonna be okay." And you just kissing me and kissing me all over till I couldn't fight you anymore and you were the softest, gentlest man I've ever met. And you had the softest, gentlest hands that had ever touched me. Do you remember that, Dobbs? You were adorable. You were in love with me. That was before I got to know you. You know, you really could have been something, Dobbs. You really could have. I mean, I don't understand how you turned into such a small piece of shit. Hey! [screaming] [tires screech] [all yelling] [tires squeal] [engine shuts off] Shit, let's get him outta here! -[Mickey] Get his legs. -Look what you've done to yourself, man. Just lay him on the trunk. [Dobbs moaning] [Steve] I'll check the engine. I'm not gonna die, am I? No, you're gonna be all right. I can tell. We're friends, right? Shut up. It's broke. Shit. We gotta get him to a hospital. [knocking] Hello? Open up please! [sighs] There's nobody here. Shit! -[Steve] Open the door! -We've got to go to a hospital, Dobbs. This is real. This is serious. [softly] No, no, it's cool. I've got some friends in LA. They're gonna fix me up. Dobbs, you might not last that long. How long do you think I'll last in jail? [Dobbs groans] [Dobbs coughing] Man, you look like shit. Hey, Steve. What? Do me a favor. What? Put on the TV. [sighs] Hey, it's Curly. [Claudi] Okay. It stopped bleeding. But if it opens up again, you're gonna die. Thanks, doc. [people laughing on TV] [man on TV] Will you gentlemen please try to be a little more quiet... I'm gonna go check on that car. Give me your hand. [on TV] Will you please step forward? Oh, no, no. Prepare yourself for the witness box. Take off your hat. Now raise your right hand. Now place your left hand here. Let go of your hat. Raise your right hand. Now put your left hand here. Come over here. What do you want? To talk to you. What is it? I want to tell you I'm sorry. Mickey... What? I just want to be alone with you. So now we're alone. What do you want? Do you want to hurt me some more? I don't wanna hurt you. I love you, Claudi. [snickers] You were in a big hurry to hate me. I got distracted. I've always been in love with you, Claudi. I can't just stop. Why should I believe you? You have to believe me. I never stopped loving you. I just forgot who I was in love with. What do you know about me, Mickey? You have dirty eyes. Thanks. You have the dirtiest eyes I've ever seen. Like flawed diamonds. Whoever invented mischief gave you those eyes. Your lips... You have the mouth of an angel. Kissing you is like taking a bite out of a cloud. Your face... I can kiss your face until it disappeared. No! You don't want to apologize, you want just get me naked. I like you naked. I've waited seven years to see you naked. I love you, Claudi. I adore you. Forgive me. Marry me. You already asked me. I didn't do it right. Marry me. Need some help with that? Oh, I don't think you can handle it. This here is an American car, boy. [grunting] Hey, come on, we ain't got all night! [groans] [groaning] [muffled yelling] I'll be back in a little while. I love you, Mickey. [gun cocks] [breathing heavily, groans] Dobbs? Dobbs? [breathing heavily] Steve? Steve? Dobbs, what's wrong? Steve? What? It's nothing. So why don't you go back and rest a little bit? Mickey'll be back in a while. It's okay. We've got to leave. We're fine! [grunts] All right, come on now, motherfucker, huh? You wanna see paradise, huh? Huh? [gun clicks] That's funny. [groaning] [Tron] No! Tie him up. [gasps] [Dobbs moans] Drop the gun. You're gonna get fucked... [grunting] Play with knives, huh? [grunts] [gasping] Relax. [grunts] Look at me when I'm talking to you, Mr. Dobbs. [both grunting] I'm gonna cut your balls off and make you eat them. [yells] [yells] [gasps] [gunshots] [groans] -[gunshots] -[grunting] [gasps] [groans] Mickey. Mickey? [sobbing] Mickey?
