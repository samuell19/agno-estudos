Where am I? Hey, hey. Whoa! Hey, stop! Stop right there! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop. What the hell's going on out here? Tex. Tex! I'm just eating some canned chili, Sarge. You want some? Get your ass out here and tell me what this woman's saying. Hey, woman, what you saying? She ain't saying shit, Sarge. Ask her who she is, and what's with that stiff in that cart? Copy that. Okay. Huh? What'd she say? Um, I don't really know, Sarge. I... I think she said... I think she said, um, they fixed him, or something like neutered him, or something. She stitched him up. You're crap for an interpreter. Sarge, this woman has very poor communication skills. Figure it out. Sarge, he's not dead. What? What's she saying? I think she said he got hit by a comet. Jesus, Tex. What? She said he has a hole in his temple. A hole in his temple? Yup, I'm right about that. I know that part. No. Ah! No. It's a Buddhist temple. It has a hole in it. And then some dead guy comes through it. Yeah. Thought you knew the goddamn language. Man, I thought I did too, man. That Burmese for Dummies is just not working out. Just one of their myths? You're making me look real bad now. You the plutonium mule? Where am I? We talking nuclear facility? What? You'll tell us. What's your name? You have a name? Well... while you're working on it, I'm working on it too. I'm with Army Intelligence. And I'm good. How did you wind up with that injury? Hmm? Where did you get the stitch job? Good talk. Well, in the meantime, I'm running you through facial recognition. It's an international database. Your fingerprints... we've got those, too. So we'll find out. Or you can just tell me. I can't remember. Hmm. What are you doing in Burma? Burma? I thought it was Myanmar. Very funny. If what you're doing here has anything to do with what I'm doing here... I've got a problem with that. Are you a ronin? Merc for hire? Did you sneak in the yellow cake, or are you in it deeper? Cake? Hmm. We found this in your outfit. That yours? Yeah. Thanks. Hmm. You're welcome. Where's the other stuff? What stuff? I'm not sure. What do you use this for? Uh, I don't know. Locate radiation. This is doable. I just... I need more time. What about that tattoo he's got? You ask him about that? Not yet. I'm still trying to get him to talk. Well, let's get on it, then. It's too soon. He's got a massive head trauma. Look, we can cry about it later. Can we do this now? Come on. It's a truth serum. Who are you working for? They call it the Valley of the Temples, right? You know what I don't understand? How the hell are you still alive? We already know that there are excessive levels of plutonium there. We know this. We don't think the Burmese know about it. And the Chinese, they'd be too smart to try to sneak this by, so they don't know. But you know. Who are you working for? Who are you working for? Why are you here? I'm here to do a job. Good. Bingo. The fisherman's wife brought me here. She thought you'd help me. With what? All right, everybody out. I can take it from here. You heard me. Everybody out. Move. Move! All right, let's cut the crap, because I already know your deal. Just... they move so fast. They move so fast. You don't even stand a chance. You don't stand a chance against what? What was that about? I think he's telling the truth. He really lost his memory. Or he's just one hell of an operative. Or we try a softer approach. I'll take him out for some air. Huh. Anything coming back to you? Just a headache. I was hoping, with some walking around, visual stimuli... Look, we are classified, and we needed to know if you're on our side. Against who? Hmm. Come on! Come on! Go! We got to go. - Let's go! - We need backup! Hey. Hey Where are we going? Ow! Come. Jake! Don't move, Jake. Don't even think about moving without all of us. Jake, look at me. Tell me you understand. You know you're risking everybody's life by being here, right? You're supposed to be dead. We got a plan. We don't stick to it, everything goes to shit. What happened to you? Jake... Who are you? Who are we? What are you doing? - Who wants to know? - I do. And who are you? Are you really asking me who I am? Yeah. Really? You don't know them? Son of a bitch. What happened to you? Hey. Hey, Jake. Where'd you go? Do not move. Charlie 2-0, this is Charlie 2-1. Is anyone there? Who the hell were those Jedi Knights that just took out my entire unit? I don't know. But they knew me. Called me Jake. Huh. Well, there's some progress. Who are they? Why are they here? I'm pretty sure I belong with them. What did they want? It's not important. You have to leave the area. You're asking all the wrong questions. He said his name is Jake. He's still foggy from the shock, but he did say that we have to leave the area. We? What do you mean, us? He's just saying we abort the whole mission? He's insistent. What are you not telling me? Let's just say it's not just about plutonium levels anymore. This is just a cover story? The story is, you follow my orders. What about Jake? He's coming with us. What, in that mental state? I'm not leaving him here. Geiger counter's going crazy. It's not that kind of radiation. Well, what kind of radiation is it? You owe me. Try to make a move, I shoot you. Is that clear? There's something in there. They don't know what they're facing. Shut up. They'll get themselves killed. - Move. - Two down. We need backup. Come on, hurry! We're three down! That's four down! Chuck, get me out of here! Aah! No! No! What the hell is this? We call in an air strike and tell them we're being attacked by some dudes from outer space. You want a Section 8? Yes! Yes! If that means staying alive. - No. - Then call me crazy. Call it in! He's after me. Oh, well, then, everybody say bye to Jake. Bye, Jake! Let's go, come on! Oh! - Shit. - We have to get out of here. You think? Hmm. Oh, my God. Hey. We have to go back for Captain Sand. There's no time. Hmm. Did you hear that? Whoo. Wow! Man, you did it! Whoo, you did it, man. Come on. Come on, give me some! Man, you know how famous you're gonna be, dawg? You're gonna be so famous right now. You know how big this is? This is bigger than Bigfoot. Move! Whoa! Jake! Who are you? You don't know? No. Forgot a few things, huh? I'm you in a few years if you don't get your shit together. You know me? I am you. I don't get it. No one ever gets what I mean. Now, someone in your situation only has two choices. Be like me, or a warrior. That's my favorite chair. I knew you'd find it comfortable. Ho-ho-ho. Get off my piano. But it's a pretty good life. I mean, I've got my hobbies. I make hats out of newspapers. Look at this. You see the attention to detail? It's an art. It's a craft. But it takes time, and I got plenty of time. And if I get a little hungry, they usually throw me some food down at the Valley. The Valley? The Valley of the Temples. You don't even remember that? Yeah. That's where it all goes down. You know, I'm going to have to figure out a way to smarten you up. Must have been a pretty bad fall. He wanted you here. Who? The Poet Warrior in the sci-fi sense. The Space Man. He's the one that gave us Jiu Jitsu. Jiu Jitsu? You are, right this minute, exactly where he wants you to be, and it is over. Ball in mitt. Game, match, set. Checkmate. Whoo! See, I can fly too. Now you're going to face Brax off right this time. Brax? He respects that. He plays fair. But if you put some bullshit soldiers on the field with him again, he'll kill you in the worst way. Nice. Jake? We're talking. Can't you see we're talking? You're gonna want to come with us, Jake. No. His mind's all messed up. He's crazy, like me. We don't have a lot of time, Jake. You know what this is, right? You know us. I don't think he does. Jake, you come with us. Come with us. Come on. Come on, you can trust me. Come on. Let them know we found him. Rendezvous at the temple. Hey, maybe I could get something to eat. Like a noodle or a pickle. Somebody give Wylie some food. Jake... he comes from there. It's the comet you see in the sky right now. It passes over the earth every six years, and causes a portal right here. But when it's open, we get a visitor from a distant galaxy. I mean, he actually comes here from a place millions of light years away looking for a fight with you, the chosen Jiu Jitsu. And if he doesn't get it, he stays and he kills everything. He taught our ancestors how to fight him. Then you took an oath... and that's how he did it. That's how he gave you Jiu Jitsu. Yeah, I could eat. Jake... Hey. Pay attention. Keep your head on straight. I said, suit him up. Hmm. If you cover yourself completely with this, Brax can't see you. Look at me. Look at me. I don't know how much you forgot, but it better not be this. Look up. You see it? Twelve o'clock. By the time it gets to those trees, it'll be dark. Fighting Brax in the dark is not what we want. We want to bring the fight to him before then. Thanks to you, we got to climb up this hill with the Geiger counters. We got to find him, we got to lure him out, get the edge. What happens after dark? If Brax doesn't square off and kill us by then, the hole doesn't close and he stays. Everyone dies. Everyone. You used to say the fight was worth dying for, Jake. All the time. I believed you. Try to keep up. A lot of us thought it would be you who has the chance to take Brax out. You look puzzled. Are you puzzled? I mean, I get it. I'm puzzled. I'm real puzzled. There's a comet, there's a portal, there's Brax. Why don't I remember any of this? Don't worry so much about what you don't remember. Which is pretty much everything. The main thing is to focus. - You remember how to do that? - Maybe. Maybe? You've been preparing for this fight your entire life. That makes sense. Fighting that son of a bitch makes all the sense in the world. Yeah, you got to fight him. Even if it kills you, you got to fight him. You get your honor back. Now, Brax fights nine fighters. Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, and then he goes home. But if any of the fighters refuse to fight him, he devours. He devours anything that walks, flies, crawls. I mean, he destroys entire towns and villages. Now, you... you, you, you, you, you. You maybe might actually have to die. But as long as you die bravely, no one else will have to. Not for another six years. That is alien politics five through fifteen. You said he fights nine. Why is there only eight of us? Like I said, don't worry so much about what you don't remember. - I want to know. - Keep moving. - We lost a guy. - What happened? Brax happened. Brax. Brax. You know who that is, right? Breathe. You got this. You got this. What are you doing? Hey. I said, stay together. Don't lag behind. You want to keep up with this crowd, you don't slack. You don't think we should go look for him? This was your plan, Jake. Your plan. I had a plan? Don't tell me. You forgot the plan? It was your plan, Jake. He'll get it. Are you trying to confuse him? Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Remember what I said. You're the rabbit. You just follow me, okay? Keep moving. Don't get distracted. This is all just noise. Just rise above it. Come on. Split up here. Victor, Franz, Forbes, Jake, you take that road. We'll meet you up on the hill. Wylie, it's time for you to fall back. You see Brax, you send up a flare. He'll be after Jake, you put him on point. We'll meet you up there. We good? - Hmm. - Hmm. Let's go. Was that necessary? You know it was. Jake, I'm sorry, man. It's not your fault. Don't worry about it. Keep moving. What are you talking about? Just keep moving. No. No, we're not leaving you. Jake, you're the rabbit. I got this. Go. It's my time. Hey. Wake up. I got a license to kill you. No expiration date. So you're gonna tell me everything you know. And I'll tell you everything I know. Okay. Nobody knows the mission but me. I've been clocking that thing for 24 years for Army Intelligence. What's your procedure? Your crew goes in one by one? That's pretty much how it is, yeah. That's not good enough. I lost too many good men... and women... following orders. You can do it different. He can heal from almost anything. But it takes him about five or six seconds before he's whole again. That's your window. That's enough time for you. Get to it, soldier. Do you ever ask yourself the question, "Why am I still alive?" So you think this is funny? He's playing with his food, don't you think? He's like a killer whale in the frozen waters of the Arctic with a seal. He fools with its head and then he kills it. It's horrible. Pull up a chair. Okay. You know something? I know something you don't know. I know that the Space Man actually likes you. He likes you because he's paying you a very high honor. And I hate to think that's undeserved. A high honor? Oh, yeah. He's saving the best for last out of respect for your skills. It's an enormous honor. And he bestows it upon you in spite of what you did. What did I do? I was there. I saw it firsthand. What you're saying is that I'm a coward. Everyone's saying it. Just not to my face. The story will be told for generations. Just like with me, six years ago. I flinched when I faced him, just like you. Yeah, I begged for my life, but he thinks I'm crazy. There's no honor in killing crazy. You actually ran. And by running, you allowed him to come here and kill the innocent. That's on you. But this time, we have a plan. We? So you're one of us? So tell me this, old man. Will I end up like you? No, you won't live long enough. You won't make it through the day. Hmm. Or he won't. That's more like it. That's the spirit. Brax has no use for a coward. He likes brave fighters. Once he has you pegged as a coward, you become like a sporting hunt to him. He's like Manolete, the clownish bullfighter, and you're the bull. He'll want to make an example out of you, prove a point, mess with your head first, and then he'll kill you. See? It's already started. He's trying to vex you. He can stop trying. You okay? You know, there is one other way I failed to mention. Be a way for you to make up for everything that went before. You could kill the son of a bitch. You're alive. Son of a bitch. I'm okay. You're not okay. We should get him under the brush. He may still think he's dead. What about you? Where'd you come from? He put me here. Forbes? Dead. Shit. Comet's moving. We got to get this done now. We move. Whatever happens... You got something to say? ...just remember the one thing you always have with Jiu Jitsu... Leverage. Move. Aah! Aah! Aah! He saved our lives. I always knew he was faking like he was crazy, so he could help you. What are you talking about? You really don't know? He was your father. He didn't want me to know. Hey, you're hurt. Can you breathe? Almost. Let's go. No, no, no, slow down. Slow down, you have a big wound. Come here. Oh, come on. Don't tell me you two are about to get on in this tight-ass temple, that's real unholy. Not to mention we got a goddamn Martian on the loose. She's hurt. Oh, she's hurt. My guys are all dead. I've been driving around trying to get a head count, I got nada. I figured these two might be of some use. Not to mention these bad boys right here. She going to need a good stitch job, or what? Yeah, let's get her to a safe place. There's no safe place around here. Hey, so you guys are like some ninja alien killers, huh? Jiu Jitsu. Ah, that's why you wear those funky-ass outfits. Well, come on, tell me. You guys are part of some, like, secret agency government probe, right? To take down Martians and shit? I've been reading about that stuff, man. Ever since I started translating in the Army, man, I'm finding all kind of crazy stuff. What is it? He said something about it kills the pain. I don't need it. What? This has been very traumatic for me, okay? I still have nightmares from when I try to milk our pet bull. You think I won't need therapy from this shit? How do you blow such big holes in him with those arrows? Blasting caps on the tips. Here's a thought. Get me wrapped. What'd she say? She says she's ready to go. What? I think she said she needs to stretch, run and exercise. Yup. What? Go. Aah! He was your father. Come on. But it takes him about five or six seconds before he's whole again. That's your window. Jake! Jake! Mm. Are we good? Everything cool? It's not another one, is it? You got to be safe about these things. You never know. It'll be like Goldilocks and the three aliens out here, you know what I mean? Mama alien, baby alien. Whoo! Who wants a drink? Ooh! Coming right up. See you in six years.
