That woman is wild tonight. Wild! - You don't need to help - I might as well. If I'm here Nothing? He's her father. He should be here. He should have been here hours ago It's not his fault At least for the toast. Then he could have left. She wouldn't have minded Can't she have more fun without her father being here? - She certainly seems to be - I don't think that's true She was dancing with that bartender again Dragging him around the room as he was trying to leave. It's embarrassing - Have you paid him? - Yes Then she danced like a... I've never seen anything like it - How many people are left? - Ten. Maybe fifteen She's always been... Technicolour... But... But? I think the breakup's hit her harder then she lets on - She doesn't exactly seem heartbroken - She's ashamed - I don't believe that - You wouldn't - What do you mean? - You know exactly what I mean - No I don't - You're a man You're saying women feel more shame then men? That's a bold statement - Yes - Why The world has been built that way I saw what happened. When they broke up Fine. If you don't want to know Tell me He broke it off. Not nicely. Then she begged him to take her bad! Really? Poor girl - Where were they? - The garden And you don't think she's ashamed? If she were ashamed she wouldn't have begged Shame stops you doing things like that. That's the point of it It's a bk uneven. I'll sort it out later - Is that so? - That is so So... What did you save for me? Thank you It's cold You're getting comfortable, aren't you? - I didn't mean it like that - I was joking I love you... amorzinho No, no, no! - He won't notice - He will notice Even if he does. He'll think it was one of them. He won't. ok? I'm driving. I can only have one drink And if I can only have one drink I want it to be a good one Do you know how much that costs? He will notice It's beautiful. Wrong temperature though You're crazy What's that? - Want some? - What is it? - She's trying to give Diana an abortion - With that? It's some homeopathic... I don't know. It's expensive, though. For coloured water Those people are taking her for a ride. I wonder how much they sell it for Would you buy this from me? Even if I looked very very serious? I'll buy air from you Poor dog. She can't just take it to the vet? Not if Western medicine is the root of all evil. And if it's too evil for Julie it's too evil for Diana She loves her animals like babies. That insane bird She doesn't take any medicine at all? Even if she's sick? No, not anymore Although she takes a Xanax or two. I've seen them hidden in that makeup bag She thinks she's being discreet. But she forgets - What? - I clean up after her. I know everything - Everything? - Everything Do you have to do that right now? Yes, yes. She wants it done now Should I check? - That sounded like furniture - So? The way she was dancing I wouldn't be surprised if something got... - What? - Broken - I like to dance. Dance with me - I know. I remember - When I'm finished - I'd love to I'm coming back. Stay there - Have you done it? How is she? - Not yet - Has she done what? - Stop it No peeping. Go away Are you afraid I'll learn your magic spells? What are you trying to conjure? Another lover Actually, can you give it to her in the morning? - Sure - Thank you thank you thank you I can't bear to see it... you know, happen. I don't think. Sorry I'd be lost without you. Do you know that? So lost You are a star - Isn't she a star, Jean? - She is Let me guess. Couriered from the office - When? - About an hour ago So delicious Smells like... Daddy's guilt - Tell you what, you have them - No They'll look so nice in your room - Jean, can you come and dance - I think I should stay down here Lend me him, won't you darling? It's like the wild west up there It's not up to me - Come on then - I don't think I should Why? If I'm going bad! In I want you to come with me Perhaps that's vanity. In fact I'm sure it is. I want to look... - I need to look... - What? Wanted Don't look so serious. You believed me. You know, I was just teasing Come on. Come and dance It's my birthday, it's the solstice. Let's get pagan Don't worry. I won't steal him She's out of control She's fine. Its just late - People are laughing at her - Laughing? They're not her friends, you know. Those people that are still up there are not her friends What would you know? I see people coming and going, I have a rough idea Are you angry with me? What a manning man you are, abandoning your partner like that This is my partner Why are you still wearing your suit! You look like you're going to court - Take that jacket off at least - Why? It's my birthday. There's a theme. That suit is spoiling the salubrious atmosphere I said take it off - Where's he going? - To hang Mn the car - How are you? - I'm fine - Are you really? - Yes Good. Good. You seem it. You seem so well - Are you having fun? - God, it's hell No, Kristina, don't, honestly, please. I'll do it before bed - You look happy - Do I? There's a sort of low level eye twinkle. You're shinier somehow So's he. I think he was miserable before he met you, you know At least now he smiles. Once or twice a month Brilliant! You're actually doing it I'm so proud of you Looks hard. All that maths - Is it hard? - For now it's ok - Do you like the teacher person? - He's nice. I think - Is he hot? - No. Old - Old can be hot. Old can be golden - Not this guy. I don't think - Have you got a picture? - That would be weird Not these days. Everyone has a picture of everyone Just type in a name and you can get a picture. Let's look him up No! You're an animal Fine. Spoilsport - I admire you, you know - Me? Why? You just get on with things. You're good at it - I quit - You said that last time - This time I really have - Well done See? You're so good - Have you set a date? - No. Not yet You should use our country place. There's a chapel there I could help you arrange it all. I would love that So would Papa In fact, he'd love it so much he might even turn up I think we want something small I'm sorry I was so rude to Jean just then I don't know what's wrong with me at the moment it's as though when my mouth opens someone else has the keys to what I'm saying Like I'm a sort of puppet of the worst version of myself. Does that make sense? - It's as though my mouth opens and I... - It's ok Do you even like me? - Très gentil, monsieur Jean. Très gentil - Vous voulez plaisanter, madame Et vous voulez parler français. Where did you learn that? My mother's from Côte d'Ivoire. Where did you? She sounds excited - Her son started school today - That's wonderful. In Salvador? - Such a beautiful place. Have you been? - No. Not yet You look better without that jacket - You flatter me - Flatter you? You ether exaggerate or you have an agenda. Ether way, it's flattery You can be so formal It's all those long drives with Daddy droning on in the bad! Seal I bet you pick up a phrase or two in your line of work. A phrase or three How long have you been working here now? - You know how long I've been working here - Do I? - Yes - Not exactly - You'd just left university - Which one? - Five years ago - You're right. It was that long - We've known each other a long time - In a way What do you mean 'in a way? In that we don't really know each other at all Although I do remember you then. I have a particular memory Of what? - Of what? - I'll tell you another time There might not be another time She is so good Is she? Good? - Why don't you sh down - Am I allowed to? Don't be ridiculous Wait. Get me something else to drink first - What do you want? - Whatever's left Aren't you having one? Jean, I don't want to drink on my own - I'm driving - It's one drink Go on. She won't mind Let's toast - To what? - To me Do you think that's narcissistic? It is my birthday after all. The day of my birth Someone should toast me And given the circumstances. It might as well be me Don't make me beg - To Julie - Thank you - They're not your friends. You know - What do you mean? You didn't notice how some of them were looking at you? What they were saying? What were they saying? - Tell me - I don't want to hurt you If you didn't want to hurt me then why bring it up? I said tell me - You need to be more aware. When you're in a room - What do you mean? - You don't want people taking advantage - What if I don't care if people... take advantage - This doesn't look good - What doesn't? - Us. Here drinking alone together - Don't be so Victorian. Relax. It's fine Jean, you look worried Are you worried? Your face... Are you waking to be summoned? My god, you are aren't you? Jesus. Can't he just get a taxi for once? Everything gets so boring, this whole bed! And call thing - This looks... - What? What does it look like? Inappropriate Why'? Have you made yourself believe something? - It's not that simple for me - What do you mean? Yes. Or perhaps I think more highly of people than you do - I imagine you do - I said perhaps - Why are you smiling? - Do you really want to know why? - I asked, didn't I? - Because you're naive I know. Do you think I don't know that? But that's actually not the right word. For what I really am What is? Strange I feel strange - You're strange then - So are you So is everything, I mean What is this, what's going on? It's so strange, all of it - The more you think about it, the stranger it gets - What? - Everything - What do you mean? I keep having this recurring dream That I'm inside something. Something warm and dark. And I can't really move But that's alright because it feels... good. In this warm dark There's something freeing in it The let go I can't even tell where I end or begin because whatever is pressing against me also is me It's like I'm everything and nothing Atomised. This warm dark And then I hear this sound. It starts off quietly. It's like a little scratching But then it gets louder and louder And it's like metal on china. Like forks on plates Like hundreds of people's cutlery scraping and banging on empty plates And then this light comes Whatever was keeping me still isn't there anymore My arms flail, slick with something. Except they're not arms, they're wings And every time I try to scream I all I can hear is this rasping screech thing And just once, when I woke from this dream there was a feather in my mouth It must have been from my pillow Have you ever dreamt anything like that? - No. I dream that I'm still moving - What do you mean? - That I'm going from one place to another - I know what moving means - What was the dream about? - I'm trying to explain Sorry, go on I dream that I'm constantly moving. That I'm trying to get my grip, trying to grab And every time I do, there's nothing. I can feel it, I can smell it, but I can't hold on to it, - Grab what? Hold what? - I don't know Why are we talking about dreams? We're awake, let's be awake Let's go up on the roof and watch the sun come up What are you doing? - I don't know what you mean - Don't play the child at thirty-two I'm thirty actually Fine. Thirty-three Like Jesus - Stop. I mean it - I'm almost afraid - Hey, how is he? - Ok, I think None of his friends are in his class But he'll gel used to it, make new ones. Anyway, let me... - No, I've goth - Sure? I've trained him well Well, is there anything else? - Sure? - No, thank you. You've been brilliant - I'm sorry it's gone on so late - As long as you've had fun Well, Where's nothing else I'm going to bed Don't stay up too late - Let me know when everyone's gone - Sure - She's right. It's late - Or early - Late - Technically. It's early - I should eject the final guests - Why would you do that? Because I don't want to leave you with those people still here - My 'fiends' - Go to bed - You're not my nanny - Then don't act like you need one Do you want your father to see you like this when he gets back? Who's to say he's coming back at all? He was meant to be here hours ago Who's to say his merger hasn't turned into a little celebration in his pied-à-terre behind the office? You think I don't know about that place? My point is, who's to say we haven't actually got all the time in the world? See? You can't use that excuse. Not yet. Anyway - He's not a bad man - Excuse me? - I said he's not a bad man - That depends doesn't it? On your definition of bad I'm starting to suspect that yours is a little... loose Sorry. I'm showing off now aren't I? I'm being garrulous - He's working. He works hard - I sort of prefer the alternative. To be honest At least then he's having some fun If he's not going to show up... ...he might as well be tearing some girl apart on those Egyptian cotton sheets I saw the receipt. They're four hundred count People are leaving now, anyway. There's another party - Now? - East. Well, the dregs of one Sea? - I should make sure the house is secure - That the house is secure? - The house is fine - It's my job to make sure the house is secure Your job is to drive my father. Why are you here tonight anyway? Oh that's right, I forgot. You're stinking the maid Joking. I was joking She's not technically the maid I'm here because your father told me to make sure this didn't get out of control - I'm here because I'm working - You could have waled in the car - You're right. I should have done - Jean, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that Have you never felt like this? - Like what? - This - What? - Alone - I don't understand - No, I didn't think so - Why are you asking me that? - Because you seem happy - Do I? - Sort of What's that got to do with anything? Tell me that I'll feel better - Tell me that I'll feel better - You'll feel better You don't know that, though. No one can actually know that I've fell lonely from it before - What? - People. Love - You? - Why are you so surprised? You don't exactly seem like someone who gives much away - Because you don't know me - I said 'seem' Who was it? Who was she? - Fine - You When? When did you feel like that? I'd been driving your father for a few months Then for the first time he invited me into the house He'd never done that before. Normally I'd just wait outside This time he took me into the drawing room From the window I could see your garden. It seemed to stretch forever, your land I thought how could someone have so much land in a city. How is that even possible The garden joins the Heath. It doesn't all belong to us. That would be ridiculous The sunlight was so bright that day. The colours. The garden. It looked like Eden Your father could see me staring. He told me I could take a look around the garden I thought he was going to come with me but the phone rang so he waved me away I walked out of these garden doors and down the stone steps I walked down this path and I saw the summer house I didn't even know what it was for. I had never seen such a beautiful building A building just for pleasure And the door was open, so I sneaked in and the walls were covered with photographs I felt strange being in there alone. As if I was hiding As if the people in the photographs were watching - Maybe you were - What? Hiding I stepped outside again I thought I'd come to the end of the garden. I was going to turn back to the house Then I saw some more steps, almost hidden I walked down them to see a whole second tier of garden more wildly planted than the first And in the middle of this... secret garden. I saw you The sunlight cut across your face. You were... - What? - You were half smiling I had never seen someone look so right - When was that? - I told you. When I first started I wonder what I was doing there - There were pieces of paper haloing your head - I was still writing You should have said hello. Introduced yourself - No. I didn't want to spoil it - Spoil it? That's a strange way to put it It must have been so hard for you, coming over here so young Courage is the first of human qualifies because it's the quality that guarantees the others - Is that Plato? - Aristotle - Oh, you're well read too - Is that a surprise? - No - It is, isn't it? - Yes it is - No it isn't - I listen too. I learn a lot from listening Do you sit there in the car listening to what we say? Wouldn't you? Once I heard you and your friend... - Oh no! Whatn did you hear? - That would be telling - My God! - It wasn't that bad - Good - Although it was a little loose - it made me think - What? Perhaps there's not such a big difference between people as one may think It's all a construct Let's go up onto the roof and watch the sun come up - No - Why? Why? - You should go to bed - Is that an order, sir? - Go to bed - Are you ordering me? Go - Hide - I'll get rid of them - No. I don't want anyone to know I'm still here - Why? - Because then they'll want to stay - I'll tell them to leave No. They'll leave if they can't find me. Just hide What are we going to do? Maybe we should run away. If this was some story we'd run away - Where? - Far - Cape Verde. Have you been there? - No - Is it beautiful? - Very. Oranges on the trees - Eden? - Close enough And what will we do there? Buy some land. Build something. A restaurant maybe - A restaurant? - Why not? New faces all the time, never a minute looking for something to do. It would never be boring There's always something to do when you run a restaurant - Do you say that from experience? - I've worked in a lot of places - What would I do? At this restaurant? - You'd be the face of the place You'd lure people in with your beauty You'd suggest the drinks and choose the music. You'd never get a single song wrong You'd be the heart, the soul of the place And every morning we'd walk straight from the kitchen and down onto the beach... ...and onto the boats. And we'll choose fresh fish. The most beautiful The biggest. The heaviest. Pearly scaled, dripping in my arms Flashes of sun. Sand. You. Barefoot. Mine You've thought about that, haven't you? We could get a plane in a few hours. We could be there by tonight Do you love me? I want to What does that mean? I thought you were sick from the heartbreak of not having me What does that mean, 'you want to'? - I can't love you in this house - Why? Explain - Your father - What about him? - It wouldn't work - What do think he is? Some sort of... - What? - Tory? - Socially he's liberal - it just wouldn't work Why? We could all pretend it would work. But it wouldn't. Not really Then I do have a better opinion of people than you do Are you surprised? Today I'm this. But by next year we could run a successful restaurant Then in ten years time we could live off my investments My god, you're serious Do you think I'm happy just to settle for this? This job is only a step I'm saving money to buy land. Once I buy land I'm going to build Once I've built I'll employ people. Once I employ people... - You'll be like me - I'll never be like you - Why not? - Because I would have earned it myself if that wasn't so utterly true I'd be offended What did you think I'm saving up money for? Honestly. I hadn't given it much thought. I was too busy gagging on my silver spoon - Tell me what you thought - I don't know I thought maybe you were sending money home to your family or something What? Flies on the face. Dust. Is that what you imagine? That is not what I said Stop looking at me like that - Like what? - Like that We could do something real together, you know. Build something. Make something - Could you love me? - Yes - So what do you think? - Of what? - Of my suggestion? Of leaving tonight - It was my suggestion actually - Tell me - I like it. I like it very much We could go before he gets back. Before she wakes up How much money do we need to start this place? Not that much. Compared to here. It's cheap there - Have you got any? - Land? - Money - I have other capital - What exactly? - My skills, my experience You can't buy a plane ticket with experience Which is why I seek a partner who can advance the funds Where will you find one at such short notice? - You must have... - What? Have what? Ready cash? Connections? Why do you think I've moved bad! Home? Do you think I'm back sleeping in my childhood bedroom because I'm such a success? Do you think this is a choice? Do you think if I had any money of my own I'd still be here? You can't have nothing at all - Everything I've inherited from her is in a trust - Everything? I can't be busted with money, don't you get it? - Well then... - Well then what? Well then, things stay as they are But we can't. This can't continue. If we stay here 'wouldn't be... - What? - Realistic Because...? Because you have a girlfriend. Sorry, a fiancée - That's not what you meant - Yes it is - You meant something else - No I didn't - You did. What did you really want to say? - Nothing - That's not true - it fucking is - Be quiet - Are you scared we'll wake her? Calm down. We need to be practical. Rational. Make a plan Rational? You want a rational experience do you? Nothing about any of this is rational. You're through the looking glass now, and so am I - SR down - Don't talk to me like that Here, have a drink Where did you get that wine from? Is that my father's Château Latour? Even I don't even touch that Which proves you have no taste - You thief - If I'm a thief so are you - Excuse me? - What we did to her is theft Do you think I don't know that? She's my friend - She's not your friend - Well no one is my friend according to you I don't think you know how to read people very well Or maybe it's that you moose not to. I can't work it out - People are people - And staff are staff This is not my fault - Did you move those? - Move what? - Those glasses, did you move them? - I don't know. Maybe I moved some things around. I was looking for cigarettes No. I'm sure it was me. I'm always forgetting where I put things - I do it all the time - Please. Stop talking - Are you sure it was you? - Yes You know I wouldn't take something someone had only a little of. I wouldn't... - You don't have to excuse it - Why? - Because I get it - No you don't Yes I do. I get doing something you shouldn't just to feel a little better, a little more yourself Why are you so unhappy? Goodness! Could that sentence drip with more contempt? You didn't even try and hide it - I'm curious - No you're not You're just looking for more reasons to find me pathetic and ridiculous And therefore absolve of yourself of any responsibility - Responsibility for what? - Of fucking me for my money Shake me and I rattle. Is that what you think? Go on. Try. Shake me - Stop - Shake me - Acting like that - Like what? Like there's something wrong with you If there's something wrong with you it gives your selfish actions some sort of meaning And there's nothing worse than no meaning is there? And that's when the real fear starts. Because you're pointless, aren't you Sort of shapeless And it's terrifying - Is that your opinion? - Yes - Is that your armchair analysis? - Yes Did it ever occur to you that maybe I slept with you... ...because I wanted to? I think you're afraid of me. You're afraid of this You're afraid and it's so pathetic. That's why you've got to find it so safe I feel sorry for you. I actually do - And I felt sorry for you then too - When? Lying in the bottom of the garden You thought you were in some sort of painting, didn't you? One of those oils in your father's study. Pre-Raphaelite? When actually you looked like any other lazy overgrown woman child Asleep with her mouth open and a cigarette burning. Asleep on a Monday afternoon You're lying Stand up when I speak to you Get up - Get up - Lower your voice - I am your employer. Stand up when I speak to you - Your father's my employer actually - Either way. I could report you - For what? With a name like yours, that can make the papers See. We can both pull rank, darling - You wouldn't dare - Wouldn't I? I've seen the way you've looked at me over the years You look at me like I'm simple. Like I'm an animal. Like you know what I want. So you play with it But it's never occurred to you. Has it. That I can play with you too? You act like I'm the crude one I've never met anyone act the way you did tonight. I've seen animals with more dignity Go on. Finish I said go on I think you're proud of what just happened. You wanted 'Moo Although the conquest was a little too easy to give me genuine pleasure You just can't see beyond this idea of conquest can you? You only see it, or me, as something to have You had me. That's what you think isn't it? Which is ironic Because if anyone conquered anyone, if anyone had anyone, I had you - What are we going to do? - We're going to leave - To talk like this to each other forever? - No. To enjoy ourselves As long as we can. And then die Die? No. Let's just build our restaurant - In Cape Verde. Oranges on the trees - We could be there so soon We could wake up there in one of those beds with the netting around it Ocean breeze No things. No things around us No stuff. No things. Just us. Just our bodies Clean sheets. Warm skin Do we have enough for the flight? Just for the flight? - We could work it out somehow... - Money money money Why is it so dirty to you? Money? You can do something with what you have. Can't you see that? Stop being ashamed and own it. Own this Use what you have to make something, build something. Be strong - Money money money, then we die - I don't want to die - Really? - It scares me I think it's a bk like before being born A sort of wonderful... nothing I think it could be worse Hell? Oh my god, you believe in God You do don't you? Wow! Why' are you laughing? No, I'm sorry, it's a bk like believing in Santa really, it's sweet What would your God think of tonight? Would he be milled? I'm tired of this. I'm going to the car - You're tired now are you? You're done? - This is stupid. We're being stupid You think I can be brushed off like that? You owe me more than that Do you want to know why your father really stayed away? It's because he hates seeing you like this Out of control. Slurring. Popping pills It reminds him of her. Before she did it And it's painful. And you know that. Deep down you know that - You're right. It doesn't look good - What do you mean? People might not believe it was my choice - You shouldn't get high - Why? - It makes you say things you don't mean - So? - It makes you talk too much - I shouldn't talk? Is that what you'd like? You'd like me nice and mute? Is that how you'd like me? Quiet? You actually would. Wouldn't you? I didn't say anything. Repeat what you said to me Fine. I regret it. I regret the insinuation I'm completely desperate. Don't you see? What do you want from me? What do you want me to do? What? I don't understand. I don't understand Do you want me to take you away? And then kiss you and then my? And then what? This is getting too painful I can see that you're miserable. I can see that somehow you've always been miserable But I don't understand you I don't have the luxury to be sad like you do Love to me is a game that I can play when I have a few hours off I don't have all day and night like you do It's not a blood sport. That's a luxury To torment yourself like this is a luxury, to have the fucking time Why are you looking at me like that? Because I want to do this I really want to be with you. So can we just go - I'm here - Are you? - I'm here. Lets go - Let's do it I just need to tell you something first Do you really want to go now? Then let's go - Kristina will be up any minute - Just listen She was a complicated woman, my mother You know that... I was the one to find her? Money isn't everything And love is a joke But you got engaged Exactly. Ha ha So what happened? I just got bored of him That's not what happened is it? Why, what do you mean? What did he say? I broke it off. Has he said it was him? The liar I saw you tell him that you were too tired. That you wanted to rest - God. You're cruel - That's what I saw - I hate you - Do you? I think I'd like to kill you. Like an animal - I'm sorry - No, you're not You wanted me to be ashamed of loving I will never be ashamed of loving. Of wanting. Of needing. So fuck you - Where's her coat? - Whose coat? Kristina's. She hung it up before she went upstairs - Did she? - Yes - Are you sure? - Yes, she did - She's gone - What do you mean gone? - She's not in her room and her coat is gone - Maybe she took the dog out again - They're clean - So? Did you wash them up? - You don't know that she saw - Why else would she leave? - You don't know for sure - I do - How? - Because she's not fucking stupid If we're leaving, then why do you care if she knows? Jean, what are we going to do? - You could leave first - Me? Just go. Travel. Go anywhere. Give us a while, enough time... For what? You to patch things up with your fiancée? - Enough time for me to follow you - No. I'm not going to go alone. I won't do that She could tell him. She could be so angry, she could tell him - I'll go if you come with me - I will follow you. I promise - Really? - Really I'm so tired. I'm so so tired. I can't think anymore. Just tell me what to do Go upstairs. Get dressed. Grab what you need for the journey then come back down - Can you come with me upstairs? - No, I've got to clean up down here Please go. Go quickly I can't leave him behind We can't take that - Jean. He won't look after him - That's insane. Put it down - It's the only thing... - Put it down I'd rather kill him. I'd rather kill him than leave him Go on. Fucking do it Do you think I'm afraid? Do you think I'm afraid of that? Afraid of doing that? The thing is... When you've seen the worst thing... When you've had the worst thing happen... Nothing really frightens you again. Because what is really frightening is already inside you It is you It's so light Jean, can you come with me? I can't be on my own today A crammed plane. People staring at me. The queues. The headache. Children screaming I can't. I can't I can't stop remembering today I can't stop remembering being a mild I keep having these flashes of summer. Of afternoons in the garden Making strange things with sticks. Talking to animals Bruises. The good kind of bruises. Not the... Finding chocolate in my pocket melted in the wrapper... ...so I could push them into new shapes and give them to her What's happened to me since then? What's happened to me? So much has happened but also nothing at all Even if I run these memories come, and with them the guilt The guilt and what I've become You're not pretending? No, let's do it, let's go. Let's go, let's do it Let's go before she comes bad! You've made a mess, haven't you? Kristina, listen to me - Listen to me and I'll tell you everything - I don't want you to tell me everything I can't stay here and Jean can't stay, so we have to go - I see - But I have an idea - And what's that? - Why don't the three of us go together?

She's a nice girl It could be the other way round. She treats me well. She treats me like a person She didn't write history. She's just snared in the story like me Sometimes she even makes it possible for us both to pretend that we're not hostage to our situation Sometimes when we're talking in the kitchen we can both pretend that it's all pretend And that makes the job sort of bearable, that we both have moments of pretending... ...that it all isn't so fucked. That it all isn't so fucking unfair Look at me! All I had here was a tiny bit of dignity And even that you've snatched, and 'wasn't even precious to you I don't think you even knew I had it. That I need it I don't think you know what it's like to need something Just what it's like to want. And want. And want What you've done. What you've just done.
