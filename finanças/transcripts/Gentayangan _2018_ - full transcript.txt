I'm in the dark. But I'm not afraid. Be gone, occupants of the dark! This is not your place. Ki, what's wrong? Why does your sister-in-law keep calling? She knows that we just got engaged. So why does she keep interfering in our relationship? She still sees me as a child, Niko. So when we get married next year... ...you won't be surprised anymore. Wait. Hello? Hello, Sheila? Has your brother called you? Not yet. Isn't Abi attending a hearing? Yes, but the trial is in the afternoon. I haven't been able to reach him all day. Sheila... ...I have a bad feeling. Can you come home? When your brother is upset... ...he usually only listens to you. I'm not home right now. I'm with Niko. I'll be there soon. Okay, thank you. Wait, Sheila, why do you have to go? Niko, I forgot that my brother attended a hearing today. He was threatened with bankruptcy because he got scammed by his clients. I want to make sure that he's okay. Let's go home. Where have you been? Why didn't you take my calls? - Are the children asleep? - Yeah How did the trial go? I don't want to talk about it. We lost. All of our clients are leaving. We lost everything, so I don't know where we're going to live now. Honey. Sorry, I can't talk in front of the children. We have to find a way out of this. The only way is the Skyline Hotel. We have no choice! At least we can stay there for a while as a temporary home. As long as we stay there... ... you can try to sell the hotel. Hello? Yes, Arman. Father died. He had a heart attack. Where? When did it happen? Where else if not at the Skyline Hotel. The Skyline Hotel? I don't know exactly what happened. But when I come home after a weekend in Yogya... ...he was lying on the floor. My condolences. I don't know what to say. Abi, the ownership of the Skyline Hotel is now in our hands. You know what condition that hotel is in. Let's just sell the hotel and split the profit. I want to start a new life abroad. Honestly, now that he's dead I have no reason to stay in this hotel. I understand. So you want me to come stay at the hotel, right? Okay. I'll bring my family and we'll be there in two days. Arman. How are you holding up? I'm okay. Welcome to the Skyline Hotel. Arman. Please accept my condolences. Yes. - Come in. - Come here. Do you live alone, Arman? Shouldn't Nani take care of this hotel? I don't know where he is. He was here a couple of days ago. But he disappeared a day before dad died. Disappeared? Yes, dear. It's hard to get a signal in this area. But it's harder to wait for your call. Where have you been? You haven't called in a long time. Sorry. There was a meeting with an important client. Surely your client is a woman. Right? Because long distance relationship means that you can flirt with other women. What if that's the case? You are an engineer but are lying. It's boring here. Alright, darling... ...you can take a walk, jog or something like that tomorrow morning. Maybe there is a mall or... Is there someone else in your room? There's no one there. You're so annoying! Okay, we'll continue tomorrow. Gosh. Luckily only a bad dream. Who's there? Help! Ny. Sofia, help! - Did you hear someone screaming? - It sounded like Zaenab. Help! Zaenab. What are you doing in the basement? Sir, madam, there is a woman here. She was a ghost. I saw her. Woman? There's no one here. I thought it was a dream too. But I really saw that woman. This place is haunted. Haunted. Abi! Abi! Sheila. What's wrong? - What is it? - I'm so scared. Alright, calm down. Sheila, what's wrong? You look panicked. Niko, this hotel is haunted. Get me out of here. Take me to Jakarta. Sheila. Sorry, Nik, you've come at a bad time. She just had a nightmare. Nightmare? Did you just say this was a nightmare? The first day when Zaenab was haunted you said she was delirious, dreaming. Now that it's happened to me, you still think it's a dream? If this were to happen to you or your children, would you still claim it was a dream? Honey, what's wrong? Calm down. I will bring Sheila inside. Come on. Wait. It's like a scratch wound. That means Sheila's telling... Is she and Zaenab telling the truth? Nobody is lying. They're right. They are both right. I... I've seen it with my own eyes. Until now I couldn't... describe what I saw. Zaenab said it wasn't adults who strangled her. I've seen everything. I've also seen the children. Then the woman that Sheila saw... The woman who approached Sheila, and this! This wound! This is the scratching of the woman! Honey! Let's go home, we'll find somewhere else to stay. - Let's leave this place. - Where are we going to go? We have nothing. We can ask for help! The important thing is we leave here! We have nothing! We have nothing! The land is vast. The building is also special. I like the feeling of this hotel. Mr. Roni. Abi. This is Mr. Roni Kusuma. Mr. Roni, this is Abimanyu, a colleague I've mentioned several times. - Abi. - Right, sir. Yes. Right. This hotel is good. Please come in, sir. - OK. - Come with me, please. I like what I'm seeing. I never hesitate to get what I like. I will buy this hotel. Honey? What are you doing up at this hour? Gosh! Who slapped me? Stop fooling around. What is this? Abi! Arman! Abi! Where are you guys? Help! Help! Help! Help! Who are you? Who are you? Abi? Abi? Don't! Don't! Help! Help! Help! Good morning. I made coffee for you. What happened to you? Why is your shirt covered in blood? It's not my blood. Whose blood is it then? Whose blood is this? Mrs. Sofia! Meet Zaenab first. I'll change clothes. Don't let her know. What is it, Zaenab? What is it? Mr. Arman and his notary arrived at the hotel. They want to meet with Mr. Abimanyu. Ask Sheila and Niko to accompany them first. - OK. - Thank you, Zaenab. I don't understand. Why did Mr. Roni disappear? He asked me to bring this document. What is this? Mr. Roni... We don't know where he went. We've tried to reach him. His phone and his things are still in his room... ...but he's not there. Maybe he went for a walk. No, I've been up since 5 am... ...but he was gone when I delivered breakfast. Maybe he changed his mind and just left. But all the items and bags are still in the room. So where is he then? If he changed his mind, why didn't he tell us? Instead of disappearing like this. I don't think he disappeared. He was kidnapped. What do you mean, Sheila? Isn't it obvious? Mr. Roni was kidnapped by an evil spirit. Miss Sheila is right. Surely Mr. Roni was kidnapped by an evil spirit who terrorized us. The ghost of this hotel. We'll never be able to get out of this place. We'll never be able to get out of this place. Any news from Mr. Roni? He didn't pick up the phone at all. There is an old man peeking into the hotel. - What man? - I don't know. Sir! Wait a minute! Sorry. Who are you? Why are you here and peeking into the hotel? My name is Yaser. I want all of you to be safe. What do you mean? Do you feel that something's wrong in that hotel? Who are you? If you know anything about this hotel that I should know, tell me. The hotel is full of secrets. Day and night... ...fear comes out of the walls inside the hotel. What do you mean? The hotel is not a place for the living. It's the home of an evil spirit. You better leave before there are more victims. Bondi. Wake up, Bondi. I'm scared. Bondi! Amira! Amira? Amira, what's wrong? What happened to you? Amira, what's wrong? Amira, calm down. Don't cry. Miss Sheila? Miss, what happened? She came back. The ghost came back. She's terrible. What do you believe happened here? Aren't you the police? Thank you for reminding me, Mr. Abimanyu. Excuse me, Sir. We are all worried and concerned about the loss of Mr. Romi Kusuma. Worried and concerned? Let's put it like this... You are not to leave the Skyline Hotel while the investigation is ongoing. Understand? Ma'am, when do they come home? Stop playing and finish your food. I'm sure they will be home soon. What's that sound? Amira's afraid. Come on. - Bondi, Amira, get inside! - Come on, get in Amira! Wait here, I'll get help. - Ma'am Zaenab! - Lock the door from inside! Help! Help! Help! - Where is Zaenab? - Amira? - Amira? - Bondi! Find the kids! Look for Zaenab! - Bondi! - Amira! Amira! - Bondi! - Bondi! Amira! - Open the door, Amira! - Amira, it's mom! Mom! Mom, it's Bondi! - Mom! - Bondi, Amira, open the door! Bondi! - Mom! - Amira! Let's go. Come on, let's get out of here. - Help! - Bondi! - Help! - Bondi! Help! - Bondi! - Daddy! Bondi! You are all cowards! Attack me if you dare! Show yourselves! Mom! Get out! Get in the car! Start the car, quickly! Start the car! It won't start. Come on, they're coming! I'm trying. It won't start, Bondi. It won't start! Amira. Stop! Where's Amira? Amira is still in the hotel. Amira! Hey, Sofia! Sofia! Sofia! This is all your fault. Sofia... If you didn't force us to come here, Amira would still be with us. This is all your fault! Sofia! Sofia, listen to me. I promise you, Sofia, we'll find Amira. We'll find Amira. I will find her. We'll get Amira back. Amira! Amira! Amira! Amira, where are you? Don't be scared. Amira! Amira's gone. I've looked everywhere. She's gone. She's left us. Mom. Mom. Amira? Amira? Amira? Amira? Amira, come here, honey! Amira, where have you been? Are you okay? Amira! What's wrong, ma'am? What happened to you? I dreamed of Amira. I dreamed she was here. But it wasn't her. Her face was a skull. It was just a nightmare. Amira is okay. Amira! Abi. Look at this. It looks like someone's had a ritual here. Look. ABDUL BANDAWASA You are from the Skyline Hotel. What I felt that night was very difficult to describe. Leave that place and never come back. But, my child... ...is still in the hotel. And I'm not leaving until I find my daughter. I beg you to help find my child. Niko! Niko! What is it, honey? Look. That's the person that Abi chased. It seems like he knows a lot about this. Let's follow him. So this hotel is said to be haunted? Yes. People say that there is a ghost. Even the residents said so. But, I never saw it. It's all bullshit. - Come on, let's go. - Come on. I'm not scared. Abimanyu! - Hello, it's Abhimanyu! - Don't shout. Everyone's still sleeping. What's up? I'm exhausted trying to look for someone who wants to buy this hotel. Finally, I found a buyer. - If that's true, that's great. - Of course. But don't scare them away, okay? I really intend to sell it. What do you mean scare them away? You know what I mean. You know better. Yesterday this property didn't sell. You are not interested. You remember Roni Kusuma, right? What are you talking about, Arman? Their family is having a lot of problems. They still haven't found Amira. You talk too much. Let's go. Sister. Where are you? I miss you. - Bondi... - Amira? - Amira? - Help me. - Where are you, Amira? - I'm here. Amira? Bondi... Amira? Amira, it's Bondi. Where are you, Amira? I'm here, Bondi. I want to get down. Bondi, help me. Amira? - Please release me. - Amira! - Amira! - I'm scared. Get Mom and Dad. I'm scared. Alright, don't go anywhere. Wait there. Come on, Daddy! Amira! Mom, Amira was right here. She was in a spider web. She was here, Mom. She was here, please believe me. She was just here. - How is Amira doing? - Amira is scared. She cried. What did she say? She wanted me to help her. She asked for help. What did she say, honey? Amira says she's scared. She's looking for Mom and Dad. Abi. You promised. You promised! You promised to find Amira! Where is she? - Sofia... - Where? Abi... Sofia... Find her, Abi. Find her. I don't care how. I beg you, Abi! Arman. Honey. Get in. The water is hot, just like me. Come on! Why do you want me to go in the pool? Let's go inside. - Arman. - It's cold. There are other ways to get warm. Come on. Who's there? What's wrong? Let's go inside. Right now. - What is it, honey? - Someone's here. There's someone else here, but I don't know who. Let's get inside. Honey, there's no one here, and no one there. I can't see anyone. Maybe it's a ghost. Honey, let's go in now. Right now. I don't want to. Fine, stay here if you want. - Your choice. - Seriously? Really? Seriously? Let go! Please! Arman! Arman! Did you see Kania? She was swimming. But I left and haven't seen her since. Arman. Yes, auntie? Let me know if you hear from Kania. Thank you. Mr. Roni? Mr. Roni! Mr. Roni. Mr. Roni! Mr. Roni Kusuma? Mr. Roni? Mr. Roni? KILL THEM ALL. Abi, help! Arman? Arman? - Abi? - You hear that voice... Abi, help! - Arman? - It's coming from over there. - Arman? - Arman? There are three bodies, Commander. Two men and one woman. Commander, this is the proof. This is the second victim's murder weapon, Roni. It can be seen from the wound on his forehead. This woman has been dead a long time. At least for a week. And the third victim? The skull is crushed from both sides, by a heavy object of some kind. It seems like there is a serial killer at this hotel. Not a serial killer, sir. A ghost. Father smiled like that. You didn't see it with your own eyes. I did. I saw everything. I'm the lucky one... ...I didn't get killed by the ghost. I smile because I don't believe in the occult. - Anggota? - Yes Sir? Gather all the victims in the autopsy room. Yes, sir. Amira! Come back. Come back! Amira! Amira, come back! Come back! Hold on! Mom, get me out of here! - Mom! - Amira! - Mom! - Amira! - Mom! - Amira, honey. Mom's here. - Mom! - Amira, honey! Mom! Help me! Brother, please! - Mom's here. - Mom! Mom, help! She's in another dimension. We have to wait until the portal between the dimensions is weak. Before we get her out. - Mom! - Amira, honey! - Mom! - Amira! Please help her! She's being pulled deeper into the other dimension. Mom! Amira! Restless souls. Return the child. Return the child... ...or I will hurt you! Amira, come out! So you're telling me that... ...your child is trapped inside the mirror. Is that right? - My child is in the mirror, sir. - Okay. The mirror broke and Ki Abdul fainted, right? So how come the mirror is intact now? Are you saying that I'm lying? That we are all lying? We are all making this up? It's clear Ki Abdul died in front of us. I'll explain it again. I work based on facts. Until this murder investigation is closed, you are not to leave this place. Understood? HOW TO GET RID OF SPIRIT 3 WAYS TO DRIVE A GHOST FROM YOUR HOUSE HOW TO CONJURE SATAN Land purchase agreement? The Skyline Hotel. "Notosomad's journal." Mr. Yaser, I want to talk to you. - Sorry, I don't have time. - Mr. Yaser. My name is Abimanyu Karindra. My dad Irwandi Karindra, is the owner of the Skyline Hotel. I found this deed... ...along with Mr. Yaser's signature as a witness. Mr. Yaser. I know who you are. Now tell me... Tell me about the hotel and its secrets or whatever it is you said. I want to know everything, right now. The hotel was built in the 80's. By Mr. Bakti. He then invited Mr. Irwandi to join. I worked as chairman of security. The hotel was very successful. It was crawling with visitors. People were lining up to stay there. We were rich in a second. But not long after, Mr. Bakti had a stroke. So he couldn't take care of the hotel for a long time. Bakti, you made the hotel into a big success. But you haven't contributed lately because you've been sick. - I didn't ask to get sick. - We are best friends. Would you consider retiring... ...and give your shares to me? I either misread this, or you're crazy, Wan. Why would I sell at this low price? - Don't you need money? - We all know it. This hotel is successful because of my husband. He designed it, bought the land and built it. You just joined in the middle of the road. You also know, Wan. This hotel is part of me. And you ask me to give you this at such a low price? No, Wan, you'll get this hotel over my dead body. I suspected you would say that. Do you want to be part of this hotel? Fine. I'll bury you in it. So that you and your family can die peacefully. - What is this? - Dad! - Dad! - Irwan! Don't do this, Wan! Mr. Irwan's offer is so cruel... ...not worth the time and energy of Mr. Bakti... ...to design and build the hotel. Irwan! Let go of my wife and children! Let go! Irwan! I told you... ...if you sign the contract... ...then your family would be spared. You're shortsighted, Irwan. Go to hell! He built a tumb for them to be buried alive in. Without air and light. Irwan! Let go of my children and wife, Irwan! They are left in the dark. And left to die slowly. A few years after that incident... ...bad things started to happen to me. My wife died for no apparent reason. My son was in an accident. I kept having nightmares... ...that Mr. Bakti's family came after me. Every day I begged the hotel for forgiveness. But the spirits there are still vengeful. Their bodies are gone. But their souls remain... ...and you can hear them every night. They don't want anyone to stay at the hotel. They will be angry... ...at anyone who tries to sell the hotel. They mysteriously die. Dad! Abi! - Dad. - Bondi, what is it? Sheila, what is it? Sofia went down to the warehouse with an axe. She was smashing the walls like she was possessed. Sofia! Sofia, it's me. Abimanyu! See what your family is doing. Your father killed my whole family! That's my family! Not Sofia's family. Kill me. Kill me! Dad. Bondi, get away! Niko, get away! Get away. Get out! Get out of my wife's body! Get out! Dad. Dad. Amira. Do you remember Amira? The first time we came here, we were with Amira. Now Amira is gone. You remember? Remember Amira. We have to find Amira. Remember. For Amira's sake. For Amira's sake. Sofia? Come on, let's get out of here. Now! Come on! Go. Come on, it's not safe here. Come on! We must leave now! Come on! Everyone get out! Get out of here now, everyone! Get out. Where's Amira? - Amira? - We have to get out of here. We have to find Amira! If we stay here, we'll all die. - We need to go now. - Amira! I don't want to go! If we don't go now, we will die. Get out! Bondi! Why are we outside? Amira is still in there. Come here, Bondi. - Dad! Mom! - We're coming. - No! - Stop it. Come here. - Amira! - Sofia, shut up! Listen! What do you want? - Niko! - Remember, Amira is inside. Niko, step aside! Abi, don't! Abi wants to burn the hotel. Abi. Don't, Amira is still inside. Don't! This is the only way, Sofia. Step aside! - Stop! - Don't, Dad. - Amira's still in there, Dad! - Don't! - Don't! - Abi, remember Amira! Don't! No! Don't! Dad. Dad. Mom! Dad! Mom! Mom. Dad! Mom! Mom! Dad! Yaser's recording of everything is there. Everything looks superstitious. But sometimes the facts cannot be seen with the eyes. Especially when it comes to revenge. Like you said, yourself. His name is also human. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes. Bondi. Come on. - Where's the ball? - It's in the car. Here.
