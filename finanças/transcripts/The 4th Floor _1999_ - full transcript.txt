For the most accurate weather, he is the man who has brought the events as they are happening... before they happen. In fact it's almost natural how accurate this man has been about weather. It has made us wonder. Starting this winter he'll be giving his heart and soul... to do it for the rest of us all over the country. This man is your new "Hello USA" weatherman. This man is Greg Harrison and he's willing to do whatever it takes. Let's cut it, I got a sense you didn't like the commercial. What makes you say that? Because you haven't said a word about it which is not like you. - Well... - Come on, I can take it... I'm gonna make you a little evil. The message is that I'm ruthless... that I'm willing to take whatever it takes to bring the people the weather. They like that. But you're not ruthless, Greg. Jane, you've got to be pretty ruthless to get to be the national weatherman. - Have you smelled this? - No. See how ruthless I am? My parents' Brownstone is just like this one. Rope Street was just around the corner. I used to walk home from school down the street all the time. Hello? Not very friendly. It's nice, isn't it? Yeah, it's alright. Sorry, it's not exactly my style. Not as if you had a style, Greg. That's why I hook up with you, dear. So your aunt fell down all those stairs? It's a lot of stairs for an old lady. Hell of a lot of stairs for anybody. Somebody should have told her to move somewhere else. She wouldn't listen. My aunt depended on no one. I would come here to visit her when I was little. I remember I used to lie awake at night... fantasizing about having my own apartment. Just like this one. - And now it's mine. - Yours? She put my name on the list, so I pay what she paid, $400 a month. $400? The Landlord can't be too happy about that. A lot of people would love to get this place for 3 or $4000. I'm not going to sublet it, Greg. I'm keeping it. Keeping it? I don't understand. We just got a place together. I just want a little space. Is that a crime? My office is so small and Cheryl shares that with me. I just... and this place is so cheap. I knew this is your graceful way of telling me... I was... I was waiting. That's why... Hey, you're Greg Harrison "rise and Shine, New York", right? Let me shake your hand. You're great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate that, really. - See ya. - Thanks, have a good night. That's why you kept pushing back the moving date? If this is your graceful way out of it, I'll live in the Westchester house myself. I'm in the middle of the most important career move of my life. I need you now. - Why couldn't you tell me sooner? - I didn't know sooner Jane, you think you can throw people's life into turmoil and it doesn't matter? It does! It has serious repercussions. - Can we talk about this? - If you'd calm down, Greg. What about dinner? You'll have to forgive me. I'm not in the mood for that anymore. I'm gonna go open up. Oh, you've got keys. How did you get the keys? I'm moving into the apartment on the 5th floor. - My name is Jane Emelin. - I've seen you here before, haven't I? Probably, I used to visit my aunt Cecile. - You know Cecile? - Well, of course I did. Hello Jane, my name is Martha Stewart. Not the famous one, though. You know, I'm the one who found her. It was just awful. Her head smashed potato. Poor dear. Do you need any help carrying your things in? No, I'm fine, I had movers coming. I have a lot of stuff. Oh, good, good. That's what this building has. Can't be bought, can't be sold. - Have you met anyone else yet? - In the building? No, not yet. Oh, we're all a very friendly group here. Mr. Colins lives on the 3rd floor. He's a dashing man. You should leave him alone though. He likes his privacy. What about the person who's right beneath me with all the trash bags? - The 4th floor? - Yeah. Oh, dear Alice. Poor thing. She was hit really hard by your aunt's death. It was just about more than she can stomach. You won't be seeing much of her. She's a hermit. - An eccentric widow. - Yeah? - Oh, what's this? - So you like older man, do you? No, not necessarily. He looks a lot like that weatherman the "Rise and Shine" guy. - Yeah, that's him. - Where did you meet him? - I helped him with his office. - Secretary? Not quite, I helped him with acquisitions. I'm an interior designer. Yes? What's going on here? You just come here and no one says anything to me? - I'm sorry. - You are sorry? You will be, you just can't move in without talking to me. - Give me your keys. - No Jerry, calm down, calm down. - You know you're not allowed the keys. - It's alright, it's alright. - What was that about? - He's the super. He probably thought he'll be moving into the apartment. He has to live in the basement with all the storage, you see. He's got a disability. Shit. Hello? Who is it? - Hello? - Delivery for Jane Emelin. What? He said it has to be set up in your bedroom... And we have to program it for you. He said you wouldn't know how to. Yeah, I don't know how because I hate television. I'm sorry madam, I'm just trying to do my job. Ok, I have to get ready. We'll just set this up then we'll be on our way. "In consideration of others you must be quiet" "respect this, so that altercation can be avoided." Altercation? Jerry... Did you write something? I know you meant it as a nice gesture, Greg... But the thing takes up half my bedroom. I don't know, get somebody to come to get rid of it. Yeah? What surprise? - Cheryl, you want to bring those in? - OK. I gotta go. I will talk to you later. - Everything OK with you? - Yeah, everything's fine. Why? I don't know, you seem a little tense. That's because the lady downstairs left me this crappy note... And I want to move my furniture around before it gets too late. Jeez. I've got to bring in those tear sheets tomorrow. I know, I know. You know, if I can have a good idea what you're going for... I can start it for you and then you can unpack. Yeah, that will be great. Will you do that for me? So call me at home if you have any questions. I've got it all under control. I'm just trying to figure it out what I could have done differently. It's not about you. It's about me. It's about this place. When you asked me to move in with you... I really wanted it to be right. I really did. And I'm trying to convince myself. Look Greg, I haven't even lived on my own yet. I hate to have us moved all the way out there... And find out that we didn't really know what we're getting ourselves into. I just know that this isn't going to turn out the way you want. Can't we just keep it the way it is for now? Then we'll see. Well, I don't see that I have much choice. Hey! Hey, wait! - I thought you were Mrs. Stewart. - Mrs. Stewart? Yes, thank God. That woman pursues me everytime I walk into this place. It's getting me in shape. I'll tell you that. How do you do? I'm Mr. Colins. You must be Miss Emelin. None of us knew that Mrs. Lewis had anyone. It's such a tragedy, anyway. I'm sorry I haven't come up and introduced myself. - It's bad form. - No, not at all. I should have introduced myself. Actually I'm kind of off to a rocky start... with half the building already. I've always been amazed at your profession. To go into other people's houses and decide how they should live. It's true, but I find that people don't know what they really want... And most of the time I have a better idea than they do. The job is to get inside their heads and try to figure it out. Sometimes that's tough. Oh, the million dollar question. What goes on inside others' heads. We only know what they show us true. - Quite a collection you have here. - Oh thank you, Mr. Colin. It's kind of all over the place right now. That carving, is that South American? Actually that's a Cambodian protective spirit... You hang it above the doorway and it protects you. I haven't figured out just how to hang it yet. I'm a collector myself, you know. Middle East mostly. I'm terrible, I keep on getting more and more things. And I don't have the space for it. Well, I could probably chat all night but you've got some work ahead of you. It's good to get a better sense of human. Hi, I'm not sure if this is an emergency or not, but... - Name and address. - Jane Emelin, 146,11th Street. I just saw something in the window right across away from mine... I'm not sure, but I sense there's something not right... Can you hold on for 1 second, please? Sorry to bother you so late. Hope you still don't have company. - On the phone with your boy friend? - No. Just wondering if I can borrow a little sugar, dear. - Sure. - Thank you. Good morning, rise and shine and get out of bed, New York city. Wipe that sleep out of your eyes. Come on everybody don't be a plain Jane. Ted was asking how to become a weatherman. Well Ted, there's a lot you can do... Oh, gross. Oh boy. You've been warned. Take it seriously. "Sorry about the noise... Jane Emelin (Cecile's niece)." Need any help back there young lady? Oh no, I'm just looking for the right size nails. Let me in, come on. For the last time I'm telling you. Open up, come on. They are both deaf. Blind as bats too. And don't touch her. They scare very easily. So I gather you met Mr. Colins last night? - Yeah, he's very nice. - Well, I'm glad you've met. But it's best not to bother him again. - Why do you think I was bothering him? - I understand, dear. But it's really best if you leave him alone. OK. Open the door! Open this door! Damn it! Hello? Apartment 5? You just moved in, Jane? I saw your note on the door downstairs. Oh yeah, I haven't met her yet. You stick something here when you try to open the door? No Well, something's jamming this up. You're gonna need a new lock. Ok, I think this should cover it. We saw each other last night didn't we? I'm sorry? Right over there, across the way. - You were looking in my apartment. - No, I wasn't. Don't you know about people and their privacy? Just kidding, don't worry about it. Hope you didn't call the cops on me or anything. No... no, of course not. I just happened to notice you and your wife. She's not my wife. She's just helping me with something. - Here's your new set. - Thank you very much. - It's a great apartment. - One of my favourite building. It's impossible to get into this building. - Is that key to my place also? - Yeah. I keep the master on every lock that I worked on in this building. The super isn't allowed to keep keys here. He's a little strained. You know, you have a really interesting face. Come on, this is absurd. I've got to move in, granny. Unbelievable... unbelievable. Oh man. OK, listen to this, you must lay large area of rug buffers down... to reduce everday disturbances. You're forbidden to wear shoes after dark... You may keep them outside your door as is customary in Japan. And there's more. After 10 pm, no guests are allowed. Any romantic liaisons may be carried out... with common regard for oral disturbance. She keep saying that. Oral disturbance? If objects are to be moved around, you may do so between 1 and 1:15... And this includes provisions. I mean, is she fucking kidding me? How many? Pages, pages upon pages... And then the last sentence says... You have been warned, so there'll be no forgiveness. You know, you should ask around about this lady. She sounds a little cuckoo. Yeah, she does, doesn't she? I mean, do you think a little old woman could have written that? You've got to close your window or something... You've got a fly problem here. Oh, I don't know. I'm probably overreacting but... But it just seems so vicious and weird. Like I have to walk on egg shell in my own apartment I understand. - You're loving this, aren't you? - Don't say I didn't warn you. These people are very unpredictable. You had this romantic idea of a friend... Are we a little nervous? Hi, I saw this at the auction today... I thought you'd like to consider it as a house warming gift. Wow, that's very nice, thank you. - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that... - No, it's OK. That's Greg Harrison, the weatherman. You know, I watch you every morning when you're on. That's very kind, thank you. We actually went to the same high school... My name is Albert Collins? You used to live down this area, didn't you? - Do we know each other? - No, no, you wouldn't have known me. But I thought that since you're such a famous alumni... I had to mention it. - Anyway, I didn't mean to intrude. - Not at all, not at all. Hello? - Excuse me, I have to take this. - Yeah. - Have a seat. - Thank you. - So you decided to stay down here? - Oh yes. - Excuse me. - Don't worry about it. So they still talk about me at Peers 4? - Yes I understand. - Of course it's very hard. I'm on your side though, Mrs. Adamson I know, I know, I'll speak to you first thing in the morning, OK? Alright, Ok, bye-bye. Sorry about that, she keeps threatening to get another... Hello? Hello? Greg? Jane. You scared me. Are you sure this alone space is good for your health? Where did you go? I was in the hallway saying goodbye to Collins. He's a nice guy. Let's eat. I'm famished. What? You have to wipe this completely otherwise they spot. No, look, this one is starting to streak already. Well, this is the way I wipe plates. What's with you all of a sudden? Don't get offended because I want my plates wiped a certain way. Your plates? You've got everything your certain way. - What is that supposed to mean? - Forget it. No, what does that mean? Please, I'm trying to concentrate. Stop it! You know, nothing is compromise with you. It's either your way or bust. You're really going to throw a fit because of the way I want my plates? Come on Jane, you're smarter than that. This isn't about your goddamned dishes. What's the difference? What's the difference if I move out there with you... Or I just stay out there with you? Come on Greg, I thought we had a great night together. We ate together, washed dishes together... But it's your place. It's not our place. You know what's your problem, Greg? You're so hung up on terms. I really don't think it'd make a tiny bit of difference. I really don't. I love you, I love spending time with you. But Jane, what do you think we are doing here? - We're playing house. - I'm tired of playing. I'm not taking shit from you tonight. I was just standing right there and then suddenly... The tiles just started exploding. I mean. Look at my floor. - Any answer? - No. That's because she supposedly never answers the door. The lady on 1st floor said a nerdy lady lives downstairs. Yeah, that's her, that's Alice. - Well, they blew up in a line. - I'd say it's your heating pipes. It happens in these old buildings. It's explosive, it's violent. It's not heating pipes. Excuse me. - Jane Emelin? - Yeah? You called a few nights ago to report on something else... About this neighbour? No, that was another person across the building next to mine. Alright, now listen... you can fill out a report if you want to. But if you ask me, you should call your landlord and check your pipes. My pipes? Yeah, OK. Thank you I thought it might be you. What's all that hubbub earlier with the police? Don't worry about it, Martha. I'm taking care of the problem. We don't like the police coming here. You mess with me, I mess with you. Do you hear that? Do you hear that? I overslept, the power somehow just went off in my apartment I'm leaving right now. "The warnings are over." Is there anything we can do legally? Anything at all? I'm just trying to think impartially here. I don't think anyone's going to believe an old lady... is capable of doing all this. Has anyone else complained? No, but I don't think it's a coincidence... It's been happening since I moved in. Everything you have is circumstantial. Listen Jane, I'll do everything you want me to... But between you and me if you're having so many problems... Maybe it'd be easier if you just move out. Moving out is not an option for me, Ashley. This apartment's just a fluke. You and Greg're going to move in together. Are you on Greg's payroll? Jane, did you bring in the mock-ups for the Bering meeting today? No, I forgot about that. I think one of the movers moved them to the basement... I'll look for them. - We need them. - Yeah, I know I'll get them to you, it'll be just a bit later. You know Jane, you're a little spun out these days. Maybe you should just let me go to the meeting. Just until you calm down and settle this stuff at home. Cheryl, I appreciate if you keep the personal shit to yourself... and just focus on the office right now. - I'll be fine. - OK. Jesus! What are you doing down here without the lights? Mr. Colins, the light switch didn't work. I just came down here to get something from the boxes. You scared me to death. You know, I almost knocked on your door earlier. Are you alright? I heard the police were here last night. What on earth warrant you to call the police? Well, I called them because I had to. I was attacked by the woman living downstairs. I'm afraid Alice didn't like your aunt Cecile too much. She must be taking it out on you. Martha told me they were friends. Friends? Not ever. No, the truth is Alice doesn't get along with anyone really. I'm sorry this has been so difficult for you, but... You know, sometimes it takes time to find your goof. Of course, sometimes people just never do find it. Like oil and water. Buildings like this are just about compromise. So maybe this is a sign for you to move to Westchester after all. Westchester? You mean Greg's house? It sounds like a lovely home and he's such a nice man. Yes, he is. No, I'm not moving there. I'll fit in just fine here. Thank you very much. I didn't mean to insult you. I'm just trying to look after you. No, I appreciate your concern Mr. Colins, but... I'll be fine, not to worry, OK? Let me in, Betty, please... Good evening. Very well, thank you. Just trying to find the goof here. Betty, come on. Betty, let me in, please. Betty! You just moved in, Jane? Oh my god. Wow, you've got an army in there! - How long has this been going on? - Just this morning. I mean, don't you think that's a little strange? You clean up after yourself and everything? Yes. It'll be a while. So what do you think? I come back later this evening? Yeah, I need reinforcement Fine, do whatever you have to do. Get out of here. I'm coming over Mrs. Adamson, and then we'll work it out I'm just having some problems at home lately... Can you deliver this to my place at around 5? - What's your address? - 146,11th Street, apartment 5. Of course, you'll be comfortable with everything. Ok, I'll see you soon. Say hello to Miss Cooper for me Miss Cooper? You know her? She's been buying groceries here for 15 years... Then 2 months ago there was a note saying she doesn't want deliveries anymore. - Tell her I'm asking about her. - Yeah, OK, I'll tell her. Come back soon. We know your address. I want to talk to you about Alice, Martha. Alice? I was down at the Korean grocery and he told me that... She all of a sudden just stopped ordering groceries from him. Wait a minute... why are you asking the Korean about Alice? I didn't ask him. He just told me that. What is it with you? First the police, then the Koreans... Don't you have any respect for people's privacy? - Are you a spy? - No, I'm not a spy. And what about what I told you about Mr. Colins? I asked you to leave the poor man alone. He told me you've been knocking at his door... Asking this and that this and that. There are rules here... But you just have to have it your way, don't you? You're just like your aunt! Why are you attacking me all of a sudden, Martha? I'm not attacking you. I'm warning you. You're walking on very thin ice down here. You're putting the thermometer on the radiator. Some of us are trying to live here. We've got to talk. Have you noticed a lot more flies in your apartment these days? Yeah, a few, now that you mention it. They've been coming up through the drain in your tub. The white things in your tub are maggots. Someting must have died in those pipes. - They like to nest in soft tissue. - Something died? Don't worry, I sprayed pretty good but I'd keep a plug for a few days. OK. Now about the mice... I was cleaning up when I found this. Now take a close look. You see the white mouse? That's an albino mouse. That ain't natural. That's a laboratory mouse. People use it to feed their pet snakes. - I don't understand. - At first I didn't either. Come here. I cover this up for you. That's the mouse hole there? Take a look at that hole. That ain't no mouse hole. Somebody drilled that. You don't have a mouse problem, lady, you've got a neighbour problem Greg, are you there? Will you pick up please? Ok, there are some very bad things happening now. I think something really strange is going on. The neighbour down below me. I really need you to call back, OK? Please! Can you hear me? Are you there? Oh my god. Oh my gosh. Portcullis. Hello? I have deliveries for upstairs. Can I leave it with you? Yeah, I'll be right down. "Truce accepted" I'm trying to tell you that somebody hit me! Look at my forehead! You passed out, Jane. You hit your head on the floor. You're my lawyer, OK? Now I'm telling you somebody hit me. - Did you see him? - I don't remember. They said her memory is going to be a little shaky. I remember everything! I remember everything that happened to me. I remember he sent me a picture of Aunt Cecile's dead body, Greg... Like he was behind it. And I was taking these pictures. I was going to show you. I had all the proof. He stole everything that I had. What pictures? This fucking maniac, he diagrammed my apartment on his ceiling. I saw it. He knew exactly where everything was... And he had everything all mapped out. I saw it. Who is he? There is no old woman downstairs. An old woman couldn't have done what I saw. He did something to her! Did any of the neighbours say anything? They don't think anything is going on. Well, we have to go to the police. Can we show the police anything? My floor, he drilled a hole on my floor. - Only there's no hole. - What? - Are you sure it was here? - Yes, I'm positive it was here. I don't understand. - Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. We have a recurring 1019 with Jane Emelin... It just doesn't make any sense. You called a few times before. Haven't you, Miss Emelin? A few times? Yes, I tried to get help. Copy that. Alright, I'll go down and check the hall downstairs... and see if I can see anything. I don't understand. So how come you didn't tell me about calling the police? They keep a list. You know, they'll think we are both crazy. I saw the plans in the 4th floor apartment. Whoever this guy is, he wants to take the building back. How about all other people on the other three floors? Why hasn't anything happened to them? Nobody knows what you're talking about, Jane. We can go back there tomorrow when I'm feeling a bit better... Then I'll show you exactly what I'm talking about. - I could find the exterminator. - No. This has got to stop. Nobody believes you, Jane I'd say you don't even have to go back to that building. The phone gets turned off tonight... I'll get the movers to pack it up tomorrow. You're safe, we've got a great house up in the country. Things got out of hand and... it happened badly... But ...it's a good thing... that we're moving in together. And I will give you what you need. I promise. Knock knock knock! You think you can get away with me? Come on, you son of a bitch! Face me now! Come on out and face me you motherficker! I'm not afraid of you. Come out, you fucking coward! You'd better come downstairs. He wants to take my place that fucking coward I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not, I'm not crazy. No, not at all. Coz I know what I know. I know he did something to that woman. And I know he did something to my aunt. I know it now. I believe you. - You do? - Yeah. There is something really evil going on. - Evil? You think so? - I saw it... I saw it upstairs. It's not something that I'm just going to walk away from. I'm trying to own what's mine and I have rights. And I won't let somebody to just take that from me. I understand. I have a right to be here just like anybody else! And he wants to take that away from me, my rights! - You were saying? - Portcullis. I tried to look after you to give you the clues. To make you see that this is not where you belong. Unlike the others, I gave you the chance to leave. But you want to know the answer to the million dollar question. Do you know it now? You're here. Welcome to my design. Welcome to the inside of my mind. Ever been caught in a portcullis before? A chamber to insulate the pharaohs in their tombs. This is my version. Help! Help! Silence is the most beautiful noise in the world. You don't understand that! Building... is an organic creature. As an organism of this building what I need is not a lot to ask for. But you have kept your rules and Cecile didn't understand. Alice didn't understand! You all have your infections. And infections have to be cleared and cut out! It's very sad, Miss Emelin. We see the world in much the same way. Territory is very important to us. Unfortunately your territory infringes on mine. I think this is the only way out. What are you doing? Colins! Gregory. Give it. Rise and shine, New York city... Even though we had a feisty fall... We got unfortunately an even more active winter on the way. This is also unfortunately my last show as your local forecaster. No no no, I'll be with you still on every morning on "Hello, USA". First let me give you the one last look of the weather in your area. Did you get everything we wanted today? Yeah, the Adamsons are back on track. I gave them some suggestions. I think you'll approve. Well, I'm sure I would. I have total faith in you, Cheryl. Hey, I'm just trying to do my job. Yeah, that locksmith guy called. Left his address, said he needs to see you. Had something to show you. Oh good, I never got a chance to thank him. For the past 10 years New Yorkers have known who to turn to... for the most accurate weather. He's the man who has brought the events as they are happening... even before they happen. In fact, it's almost unnatural how accurate this man has been about weather. It has made us wonder. Starting this winter he'll be giving his heart and soul... to do it for the rest of us all across the country. This man is your new "Hello USA" weatherman. This man is Greg Harrison. He's willing to do whatever it takes. THE END Corrected by jcdr
