Wolf dashes away again. Who will win? Is it Wolf or Alexander People along the waterfront can't wait to find out who'll win. A left, Alexander uses a two punch combination. Wolf keeps his guard up. Wolf, what are you doing? Come on! Wolf, what are you looking for? Wolf, whar are you doing? Wolf is just lowering his arms. Come on, do something! A left, Wolf dashes away. He barely got away there. Wolf is not engaging. He turns away again. Uhh...that was close! Come on guys, do something! They are still loitering. When will this match end? Wolf doesn't seem up to it. [Horn ending the match] Your eyes reflect in the surrounding green... where darling buds gently blossom on delicate branches. You stand tall and your eyes tell me: [Knocking at the door] "Come here and let me hold you" - Wolf - Occupied I said "It's occupied". [Occupied] - Wolf Wolf Why didn't you fight? Hey Wolf, why didn't you fight? - If you smile at the moon three times, it'll smile back - Wolf Guess it's not doing it today. Do you believe in miracles? - No What do you mean by miracle? Something supernatural that is caused by inexplicable forces. - I believe in timing and precision. Cut it out - Mr. Realist If you don't believe in miracles, you're not a realist. I vanished into thin air. - So, I see Come on, sit down. - Look, a coin. It's a wishing well. Make a wish - How could this have happened? - He just had a bad day. - It's a disgrace. - It wasn't his fault. - And Wolf? - He has to start working. - Take it easy. - Now what? - A rematch - We will have a winner. - Keep them on their toes, and above all, keep them apart. - Punch Punch Punch!!! This Sunday there will be a rematch between Wolf and Alexander. Rules are rules. There will be a winner. - Though angry eyes gaze down on me... a drop of light shines over wintery faces. Though beauty slowly seems to fade... in you I see a fire that blinds the brightest of lights.
