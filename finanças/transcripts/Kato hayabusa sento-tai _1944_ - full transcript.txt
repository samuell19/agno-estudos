LET US WORK TOGETHER WITHOUT STOPPING Toho Production COLONEL KATO'S FALCON SQUADRON A national movie under the aegis of the Ministry of Information With the assistance of the Department of the Army Produced by the Toho Group CANTON, CHINA APRIL 1941 He was expected to arrive at 17:00pm. It will be difficult in this weather. He may have turned around. Perhaps. Exactly 17:00 pm. Attention! It's been a long time, Amba. Indeed. You came directly from Taiwan? We thought you might not make it. The clouds were very low. I just had to fly above the waves. You must be very tired. Do you want to go to your quarters? No, first I have to make my report to the Brigadier General. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Tateo Kato. I am delighted to return to the crack 64th fighter group as your new commander. FIGHTER GROUP HEADQUARTERS To your health! Nothing is more important! Who used to live in this house? A general in the Chinese air force. They even have a piano. Commander, the men have written a song that they'd like to sing for you. With pleasure. Kunimi? Would you like to play the piano? Everyone else will sing. I don't know how. Don't be shy. Go ahead. - Go on. Play for us. - Why don't you want to play? Everyone... let's sing. With the loud sound of the engine, The Falcons go To the ends of the clouds The rising sun shining on our wings And the Red Eagles drawn on our chests Are the symbols of our fighters Cold, wind, and intense heat is nothing to us We can bear with trials and tribulations Expert aircraftmen maintain the airplanes And they pray their airplanes do well With parental feelings for their lovely airplanes Having had many air battles The roaring sounds of bullets, With faith in our ultimate victory And cooperative spirit to die together if we die We grab our sticks with our hearts After years of fighting We received seven testimonials But there were tears in the shadows of our feats, Ah, the samurais are gone, With the spirit to die with a smile We are proud of our tough eagles throughout the world Our wings go through thousands of miles Observing shining traditions, We will create a new Great Asia We are the fighter wing of the Imperial Army A FEW MONTHS LATER THE 64th FIGHTER GROUP RECEIVES NEW FALCON FIGHTER I was wondering who flew this morning, just before dawn. Looking out the window to the right, I saw our commander. Such courage! Our commander has already mastered the Falcon. He's both hard working and a natural pilot. You both seem to admire it as if it's a new toy, while our commander creates new tactics based on it's strengths. I respect him a lot for that. Taking off from our base at Canton, I flew over the island of Hainan and then to French Indochina but all of the airfields in this area were flooded. So I decided to fly to a place called Phu Quoc. You made it all the way to Phu Quoc? I found a place that we can use as our new airfield. It does require some work though. It just has a few cows but generally it's good. You really went a long way. Yeah, but I'm stiff all over. Getting too old for this. Impressive... flying solo to Phu Quoc. He is a very good navigator. Unlike you! Before my return, I got a pass to Saigon where I bought this. What is it? What?! You really don't know? It's a coffee grinder. Oh, right. You prepare coffee with it. It's much better prepared this way. I'll make coffee for every one of you. It's very difficult to make coffee properly. I need to teach her. Come here. You... go boil up some water. Understand? IN EARLY DECEMBER, THE 64th FIGHTER GROUP RELOCATED TO THE ISLAND OF PHU QUOC IN SOUTHERN FRENCH INDOCHINA MEANWHILE... Our convoy containing General Yamashita's division is currently in the Gulf of Thailand... heading toward the landings in Malaysia. The convoy will enter enemy airspace on the 7th of December. The Sugai air division must protect this convoy against the enemy's air attack. Finally, the Aoto squadron must provide air cover for the convoy during the day on the 7th of December. I think it's impossible to fly at night on these instruments in this bad weather. I've never been in a situation like this before. We could lose everything. Everything depends on Yamashita's successful landing. This campaign can influence the outcome of this war. I request that I be in charge of tonight's mission. I understand why you want to replace me but you're my senior pilot ... ... so you must remain here tonight. If something happens to you at the beginning of the war, the men's morale will be destroyed. You don't trust me?! I'll come back no matter what! I would like to come with you. But you just got here. That doesn't matter. If I stay behind, I won't be able to do my duty. This war will be a long one. For now, rest. I'm very rested. Please. No need to hurry. As you order, I will remain here. But can you at least take Takada with you? Please. Okay, I'll take him. Thank you very much. Thank you. The weather is getting worse and worse. We must be careful. 17:30 TAKE OFF THE CONVOY 19:10 ON PATROL ABOVE CONVOY ESCORT FOR ONE HOUR AS NIGHT FALLS, RETURN TO BASE They should have been back by now. "We climb, we will pass over the clouds. "We climb, we will pass over the clouds. "We climb, we will pass over the clouds." They must have encountered some sort of trouble. FATIGUE DISORIENTATION SLEEPINESS Nakamitsu! LT. TSUKUJI'S PLANE 6,000 METERS ALTITUDE LACK OF OXYGEN Are the signal lights working? Yes, sir! Turn on the searchlights. Turn on the searchlights! THE AIRCRAFT SHOULD BE FLYING OVER THE LAND ABOUT NOW BUT THICK LAYERS OF CLOUDS PREVENTS THE SEARCHLIGHTS FROM BEING SEEN LT. TAKADA'S PLANE IS THAT A SEARCHLIGHT? KATO DESCENDS 1,200 FEET LT. ODA FOLLOWS HIM Do you think that could be the commander? Lt.s Nakamitsu and Tsukiji are dead. And the commander? I lost sight of him. Takada? I don't know. Takada! Takada! Kato is here! They'll be out of gas soon. 23:00 PM Commander, the pilots who've returned should get some rest now. Yes... Returned! Lt. Takada He insisted on going with us. I was too sentimental and now I almost feel... ...guilty. I can't do this. THE 8TH OF DECEMBER ATTACKING THE ENEMY BASE TO PROTECT THE YAMASHITA DIVISION PENANG THREE ENEMY AIRCRAFT SET ON FIRE AND THREE DESTROYED ALOR SETAR THREE AIRCRAFT SET ON FIRE AND THREE DESTROYED This morning the Yamashita division managed to land on Kota Bahru, Singora and Patani. That's great! Excellent! According to the radio, the Imperial Navy has attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Hawaii. They did? Unbelievable! TWO DAYS LATER, ON THE 12TH OF DECEMBER, THE 64TH FIGHTER GROUP MOVED TO KOTA BAHRU The Yamashita division is trying to occupy the bridge before the enemy can. Our timetable for capturing Singapore depends on the capture of this bridge. Our bombers will attack the enemy to prevent them from destroying the bridge. Enemy fighters will surely attempt to intercept our bombers therefore we've been ordered to escort them. But before that, I've decided that we destroy the enemy's base completely. We will now destroy all enemy aircraft in Kuala Lumpur. ENEMY AIRCRAFT! THE SECOND SQUADRON ACTS AS BAIT THE ENEMY CAUGHT IN THE TRAP ARE SENT TO THEIR GRAVES... ...BECAUSE THE AMBA SQUADRON PROVIDES HIGH COVERAGE THIS WAS THE FIRST AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT, IN WHICH KATO'S GROUP TOOK PART IN THE GREATER EAST ASIA WAR ON THE 24TH OF DECEMBER, THE GROUP RETURNED TO THAILAND Is she Japanese? Yoshi? Can you bring our refreshments outside? Wow! How is it that you know her name? Don't get all excited. She just works here. Oh, okay. What a shame. It is said that the air force life in Burma is very hospitable. Unfortunately for you, our job tomorrow won't involve fighting but instead escorting bombers. Don't forget that. Oddly enough, it's as if we're expected to repel at long range rather than crushing them one by one. Like this. THE 25TH OF DECEMBER - THE ATTACK ON RANGOON HEADQUARTERS OF KITAMURA'S GROUP Whatever happens, have at least one element above your formation. I'm counting on you. Any problems? Sir, your machine guns aren't working. That doesn't matter. What will you do without them? If I don't go, who will command my squadron? I'm going. THE KITAMURA AND OYAMA GROUPS ARE BOMBING TODAY KITAMURA'S GROUP OYAMA'S GROUP RANGOON ENEMY FIGHTER JET'S BEGAN ATTACKING KITAMURA'S GROUP FROM ALL SIDES AS SOON AS THE BOMBING RUN FINISHED THE ENEMY IS SO AGGRESSIVE THAT EVERY JET ESCORTING KITAMURA'S GROUP RUNS INTO A FIGHT COMMANDER KATO HE TURNS AROUND TO SUPPORT THE OYAMA'S GROUP, WHICH IS FAR BEHIND HIM OYAMA'S GROUP COMMANDER KATO PROTECTS THE OYAMA'S GROUP, WHICH RETURNS WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS AS FOR KITAMURA'S GROUP, WHICH RETURNED EARLIER... I'm sorry. We were not well prepared and therefore failed to protect you. My apologies. Apology quite unnecessary. Our losses were low because of you. You've done your duty well. Thank you and thank your men. No, this wasn't good at all. Assemble! All present! Loosen your helmets! The bombers your were escorting suffered major losses! How many times have I told you to stay with your charge?! Lack of training is no excuse. This is unacceptable! One of you even broke off to pursue the enemy and left everyone else behind. For an escort mission to succeed, we don't need you to shoot down the enemy's aircraft. In this escort mission, it's unfortunate that we've got ten victories. We should be celebrating our victories but let's do it some other day. The commander is in a really bad mood. Plus we lost Lt.s Okuda and Wakamatsu. I brought you some fruit. Come get some. Let's have some now. Kunimi, Enoki... come over here. Shindo and Nili, you too. What are you doing, Enoki? Come on over. This is the same kind we had in China. They must be better in Taiwan. Enoki, I told you to come here! Dig in, Enoki. What now? I'm getting my chopsticks. Wait, I'll get you some. Sit down. Use this. Thanks, but I have my chopsticks. This is much better. If you insist. So, is it good? Lt. Okuda. I was told that he had problems with his guns before he took off. Even though he was a new addition to the squadron, he still thought of his duty... taking off with no weapons. He was a courageous man. What a pity. THE FIGHTER GROUP RETURNS TO KOTA BAHRU IN MALAYSIA IN THE BEGINNING OF 1942 Take over for me. What are you doing, sir? IN JANUARY, AIR OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA RESUMED THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ENEMY'S AIR FORCE IN SINGAPORE BEGAN IN THE NEXT TEN DAYS, SIXTY MISSION WERE FLOWN FORTY ENEMY AIRCRAFT WERE SHOT DOWN AND TEN DESTROYED ON THE GROUND BUT WE SUFFERED LOSSES TOO K.I.A. OF THE 64TH FIGHTER GROUP I have been mistaken... I had thought the commander was uncaring when it came to the loss of pilots... ...thinking that he thought of death as inevitable for a fighter pilot. But that's not true at all. I could tell that from the commander's prayer just now. It couldn't have come from someone who doesn't have feelings... ...or ability to distinguish between life and death or anything else. I finally understand the greatness of our commander. I heard he changed as a consequence of his experiences in China. Yes, it changed him. It...perfected him. In China, he could show his sadness when he lost one of his own. For example, when he lost Kawahara in 1937, he shaved off his moustache as a sign of mourning. He has changed a lot but to get to this point he had to overcome and endure many things. We have a long way ahead of us to get to where he is. ON THE 6TH OF FEBRUARY, THEY ARE SENT TO KAHAN Enoki! Yoshida! My respects to the commander. It's been a long time... You've become a paratrooper. Why didn't you tell us you were a paratrooper? We went to school together! Exactly why I wanted to come see you tonight. You didn't bring anything? Not even a bottle of whiskey? Sorry. The food isn't so good here but there is a variety to choose from. Very unfortunate indeed. Don't worry, we can stuff ourselves once we take Palembang. Leave some food for us, we'll join you there as soon as possible. How's it going over at Palembang? A lot of anti-aircraft fire. Enough to walk on. We must be careful. Don't worry. We're prepared. It's not so bad once we're on the ground... ...but we're vulnerable in the air. Count on us! We can also rely on our commander to watch over us. Perfect. Until tomorrow then. Is that why you've come? You're scared about what might happen tomorrow? Nonsense! I have to go and have a few drinks with my men now. Good luck! I'm counting on you. He seems to be more nervous than usual. Perhaps because he doesn't have wings like ours. We pray our parachutes open correctly GOOD LUCK, PARATROOPERS! ENEMY AIRCRAFT! Follow me! The signal man has landed. Group 1, rally in the designated area. Gun ready! Attack! Advance! Gunners, keep up your fire! Everyone, advance on the enemy position! I'm delighted that the paratroopers have landed unharmed but now we have to escort a convoy up the Musi river. Coordination between the convoy and the paratroopers is the key to our success. As soon as all aircraft are refuelled, we'll take off immediately. ON THE 15TH OF FEBRUARY, THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER WAS RAISED OVER SINGAPORE ON THE 17TH OF FEBRUARY, KATO'S FIGHTER GROUP MOVED TO PALEMBANG ON THE 9TH OF MARCH, DUTCH FORCES IN INDONESIA SURRENDERED UNCONDITIONALLY THAT SAME DAY, KATO WAS PROMOTED TO COLONEL What is it that you're carrying? Lobsters, sir. They're really big. Wait, I want to take some pictures. Enoki. How do you take such beautiful photos with just a basic camera? It must be your personal technique. Just the camera. Nothing else to it. A good samurai knows how to choose his sword. You know Shindo, it's best not to offer advice about something you haven't mastered. I used to always keep my camera near me when I was traveling on the train. Once, when the train lurched, I dropped it and then yelled "Dammit"! Then I realized it was my own stupid fault and was ashamed of my own clumsiness. No, no Enoki! Not now. Show me some respect. I have avenged myself from that time you photographed me with that rooster. Get back here, Enoki. What a rascal... AFTER THE END OF THE JAVA OPERATION, THEY PARTICIPATED IN THE BURMA CAMPAIGN STATIONED IN THAILAND THEY ATTACKED THE ENEMY AIR FORCES IN BURMA... ...DESTROYING THEM IN A FEW DAYS BUT THE ENEMY GROUND FORCES REGROUPS NEAR THE CHINESE BORDER THE AMERICANS, THE BRITISH, AND THE BURMESE PREPARED TO COUNTERATTACK THE 8TH OF APRIL SOME OF KATO'S GROUPS ATTACK FIRST We have a very serious situation. What happened? Okubara, Kuroi, and Oda were all killed! Our commander? I don't know. We got separated. We had just observed two enemy aircraft. We were then jumped by twenty more! A few more stragglers returning. Wait, it's the commander! Is our commander injured? Good. Oda caught fire and crashed straight into a hanger. A magnificent sacrifice. Hey, Enoki, Captain Amba is... What? To this hard day... What do you say to attacking them tomorrow at dawn? If we attack at sunrise, we'll get our revenge. Loiwing is just within the range of our fighters. Most of our flights are also over the enemy's territory. If we fly during daylight, the enemy will see us. So we must fly at night. We get there at sunrise, destroy them, and return immidiately. What do you think, Shindo? It's a good idea. But how do we fly over the mountains in the area at night? Furthermore, the enemy base is small and located in between the mountains. I was surprised today how small it was. So at night... If our navigation is good, we'll get there. Don't you think so, Maru? Yes, absolutely! Trust me on the navigation. There will be moon all night. That will allow us to see the Mekong and Salween rivers. That's the way we'll do it. We will avenge Amba and all the others! All pilots, assemble! At ease. Here are your orders. First - the main enemy force was spotted near Loiwing this morning Second - our fighters must destroy these enemies on the ground. After we landed, Kato told me to only count two-thirds of the claims we normally would. As soon as we return from the mission, we take off again and get into a dogfight. We didn't get surprised like this before. We were shooting them down, left and right. I was hit in three places. Three times? I'm much better now. Hey, Enoki. So, it's you. You're still alive! Don't talk nonsense. I'm not like you, half-way through after-life. What are you talking about? Tell me about the others first. Not so bad. The commander is sick and here at the hospital. Really? He seems so strong. He's exhausted. He's been flying a lot lately. No matter what, he can't force himself to keep doing this... He should be taking it easy in the hospital for a while. Yes, but given his character... even in bed, he cares about his fighter group. He always say that he's going to the doctor but then demands to leave so he can return to his unit. It's troubling. No, I'm not staying. Why not? We've found a place where you can relax. It's nice and quiet here. You should at least stay two weeks. Thank you for your concern. But I feel rested already. Don't push so hard. I feel relaxed when I'm flying. I'm leaving tomorrow. THE VERY SAME DAY, ON THE 17TH OF MAY, THE UNIT MOVED TO AKYAB THE COMMANDER JOINED THEM THE FOLLOWING DAY What time will the commander arrive? Sometime around noon I think. Should be any moment then. That must be him. No, it doesn't sound right. Enemy aircraft. Altitude 1,500 feet. Air-raid! Air-raid! Bastard! Thank you, commander! This is embarrassing. Let's take care of the plane. You're too nice to me! THE NEXT DAY, ON THE 19TH OF MAY Commander? Ah, it's you Enoki. We've been waiting for you to get back. Things should start getting better now. I shall now give you my report: Lt. Kohei Enoki - Army Air Force, released from hospital on the 15th of May reporting for duty, sir. You needed have rushed back. You could have stayed a little longer. Yes, but I heard you were short of pilots. Some pilots have returned to Japan, others are sick. In short, we've been weak for the last six months. I brought a pack of cigarettes. Would you like one? I'm not sure I can accept such an expensive gift. Thank you. You don't smoke, do you? No. I see... Thank you. I have another gift for you. Good God, no! Give me the negative. I'll pay anything. No, no. I need it as a souvenir. No you don't. Give it to me now. Please, no. You are a rascal. THE AKYAB BASE IS TOO CLOSE TO THE FRONT LINE AS THE CONSEQUENCE, THE GROUP HAS TO MOVE TO TONGU I'm leaving you tomorrow at noon. Notify headquarters. Yes, sir. I'll inform headquarters that you'll be arriving tomorrow afternoon. Excellent. What is that? Start the engines. Chance! Chance! ON THAT DAY, IMIZU'S PLANE WAS HIT AND CRASHED IN THE JUNGLE Lt. Imizu Remember that you have to take off quickly when there is an alert. Why did you say that? Why did you say "chance" in English? I said that? And you clearly repeated it twice. Maybe you should be fined for using the enemy's language? I did? Damn! A fine, a fine! Liars! I never said that! You did! It was exactly like that. I have contacted Ohba's group. What about Imizu? We must now ask the volunteer army to continue to search. Volunteer army? Yes, sir. We don't know if it's in the enemy territory or not. "Volunteer Army" is what headquarters advised us to call the Burmese. You know how to contact them? Yes, sir. One of our officers is in their rank. See to it at once! Kuroya, wait a minute. Does anyone of you have a picture of Imizu? You can take it with you? It's amazing that I have a tent after all the enemy attacks. They drop bombs on it every time. Last time... ...they demolished it just after I had landed. If I had been in it, I would be crossing the river San-zu this very moment. I've been very lucky. I have returned, sir. Let's slip into my office for a moment. Any news? Our officer was in fact not present. I returned here after I had waited for him for an hour. I understand. That's annoying! No idea where he might be? No, sir. I'm sorry but you'll have to go back again. Do you think you can bring him here? Yes, I will return with him. When I was in Germany, they showed me Hitler's new airplane. I got to fly it after some brief instruction. They were surprised how quickly I mastered it. "This crazy Japanese pilot." I don't like macaroni. I'll rather have my spaghetti without any holes. Anyway, that's Italian cuisine for you... I was told that the best way to eat it is to wrap it around your fork. In my part of the country, there are some small birds called "Cherry"... ...that were nesting on my my roof. I always watched the nests when I was little. I'd take the babies in my hands. They were very soft and warm. Still they do not come. It's 1:00 am. I have returned, sir. They ask that you wait until tomorrow. Night complicates the search. They cannot give you anything more until tomorrow afternoon. Very well. Sorry to put you out. No trouble at all, sir. Let's get some sleep. I've kept you all up too long. Still no news from the volunteer army. It's not a good sign, sir. Discouraging. Shouldn't you be leaving now? I'll wait a little while longer. Shindo, what's the matter? I caught a cold this morning. You're ill? Yes, a little. You have dengue fever. You need to go back to Tongu. Aren't you about to leave yourself? I could go with you. Not just yet. I'm waiting for word on Imizu. You need to look after yourself. I know what dengue fever is like. That's an order! Go take care of yourself. Lt. Shindo returning to the base at Tengu. Take care. AN HOUR LATER... You're leaving soon? In a little bit. TWO HOURS You're sure that Imizu landed in the jungle? And not in enemy territory? I'm sure it was in the jungle but from what I could tell... ...he must have been seriously injured. I'm certain that he must be dead by now. Okay. Either way, the volunteer army doesn't have any further news. I'll be back soon... Start the engines! THAT DAY, ON THE 22ND OF MAY, 1942... ...THE WAR GOD DID NOT RETURN ACCORDING TO THE RECORDS, KATO ATTACKED THE ENEMY OVER THE SEA... ...50 MILES NORTHWEST OF AKYAB BUT HIS OWN PLANE WAS HIT AND CAUGHT FIRE THE COMMANDER, PROBABLY INJURED, LOOPED HIS PLANE UP... ...BEFORE DIVING STRAIGHT INTO THE SEA Our wings go through thousands of miles Observing shining traditions, We will create a new Great Asia We are the fighter wing of the Imperial Army THE FRONT REQUIRE AIRCRAFT AND TANKS. SEND THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
