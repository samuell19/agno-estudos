It has been seven days since my last confession. - Go on, my son. - Father, I've been having these thoughts. - What kind of thoughts? - Immortal thoughts. Indecent. - What kind of indecent thoughts? - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. - About boys. - Boys? - I dream that I'm with a boy, a man, and I see him maybe in the locker room, or on the beach, or in the shower. Or maybe it's just my friend in my room and we... I see him, he sees me, and we connect, you know? We just connect. We know what this is about. We know what... What this is. - Get to it. - He looks at me, I look at him, he just nods and I just nod. We know. You know? We connect. We move close. Real close, like I can feel his breath on me close. We just have this deep stare. So deep. I grab him, he grabs me, and we just embrace. It's not about lust or even about being horny or whatever, it's just that feeling, that deep... That deep feeling. - And then what? - His lips are touching mine. I'm kissing this man in my room. He's kissing me. A kiss, a deep kiss. So deep. I'm getting this deep feeling inside me. That I wanna do things with this man, and I want this man to do things to me. Sexual things. Indecent things. - Like what? Get to it. - I want to do things with his body. With our mouths. I wanna kiss his body. I want his breath on my body. I wanna kiss his body, make love to his body. Worship his body. - You wanna be his bitch. - What? - You wanna be his bitch. - No, Father. - You want him to use you. - No, Father. - Then what do you want? - I want him... I want him to do things to my body. I want him to love my body because he wants to. He doesn't wanna use me, Father. He wants to love me, he wants to kiss me, he wants to love my body, worship my body. Touch my body. I want his breath on my body. Just our breaths and our bodies. I wanna feel and kiss and breathe and feel and kiss and breathe and feel and feel and kiss and kiss, feel and kiss and kiss and feel and kiss and... Then the ultimate deep, Father. Heaven. We reach Heaven. We have felt, we have known, we have loved. So deep, Father. So deep. We know. - You've been a bad boy, indecent thoughts. - Yes, Father. - You must do penance for your sins. - I know. - Well... Get to it. (slow, rhythmic drumming) - [Lee] The one thing I love, more than anything in the world, is a big, black dick. (dramatic synthpop music) The taste, the smell, the feel of it chaffing my lips. The heat of it as it slaps against my face, its warmth, the look of it, the color, the brown or sometimes purplish tip. The chocolate shaft, a vein to lick. There's nothing I love more than a big, black... Dick. There's nothing I want more, I need more, than the touch, than the hand of a big black man. His flesh against mine, the color, the contrast, the curse of Ham, the salvation of Zion. Those beautiful lips that give me a hardon. Brown eyes, brown skin, black hair. No light. Gets me feeling myself in the middle of the night. White smile, black face. You bust, then you stand. There's nothing I need more than the touch of a big black man. (dramatic acoustic guitar music) - Okay, so I'm at work, and then the news breaks and INews just goes nuts, I mean goes nuts, and we're in the middle of C-Block, okay, and then my cunt ass EP just telephones down, telephones down, and mind you we're about to go live. She telephones down. Just the way she said it was... "Oh, um, the police just gunned down "another black kid in Harlem, protest in "the streets, just go ahead and break it." - What's wrong with that? - "Just go ahead and break it." No real emotion, no real empathy. Mind you, I'm the only nigger on set, fuck, in the control room. - Of course. - So of course they don't get it, but then again I have to think do I look bias by pushing this forward-- - Amadi, nobody's thinking that. - You don't know that, okay? - Look, they're not. - Look at this. - No more work. - Thank you. - Eww, gross!

(heart beating) - [Officer] You two were arguing. - [Amadi] I mean yeah, but it was nothing. - What were you arguing about? - Work, finances, couples stuff. - Because he's an artist and you pay all the bills. - No, because we're a couple and couples argue. - But after most couples argue one of them doesn't usually disappear. And their other doesn't usually wait almost a week to report it. - That's only because I knew it wouldn't be taken it seriously had I filed it less than a week. - Do you mind continuing this down at the precinct? - Man, fuck you and the precinct! - There's no need for aggression there, buddy. - Both of you need to get the fuck out of my house! - [Officer] We're trying to help you, sir. - Trying to help me? If you were trying to help me you'd be... (hyperventilating) - Hey, get your hand out of your pocket now! - I need my inhaler. - What? - I'm asthmatic and I need my inhaler. - Right there? I'll get it for you. All right. - Now both of you can get the fuck out of my house. - [Officer] We'll notify you if anything comes up. (laughs) - [Rachel] What, no, stop laughing, it's not funny. It's not, you see, this is the problem. This is why your son thinks it's okay to punch his teacher in the balls. You need to get upset and get mad and grrr! - Grrr! - [Rachel] Yes, yes, you make him think it's okay with your laughing and your high fives and your stuff, he gets all that from you. - Okay, you know, that teacher was a dick right? Everybody knew he was a dick and he got what he deserved, period. - [Rachel] Whatever. - And truth be told, if he's going around punching guys in the balls he got that from you, not me. - Oh really? - [Lee] Yeah, really. - Shut up. (chuckles) I was just trying to... - I messed up. - No shit. - No, I messed up. - Lee. Lee, what's wrong? If you tell me I... Lee. Lee come on, what's wrong, what's... (ominous ambiance) What? It's okay. (ambiance intensifies) Have you heard from Thomas? - No I haven't. - Fuck. This opening might just be you then, you know. - Everything will be just fine. - Don't get smart. - Rachel. - This is the tale of Enik and Alex. Alex was a slaver who was much loved by his darkies, and he loved them back so, but none did he love more than his Enik. Enik and Alex had basically grown up together. Alex's father had purchased Enik's family when he was about 12. And immediately Enik and Alex had a connection. And like all boys, they experimented sexually. So much so over the years that Alex's father insisted that Alex take a wife upon his 16th birthday. With a heavy heart, Alex did. But that did not stop his visits to Enik's slave quarters. On one such night, Alex's wife, clueless to the whole situation, followed Alex down to the cabins. And when she opened the door, what did she see? Alex balls deep into Enik's chocolate hole. Well she screamed and ran for the authorities. Knowing that their fate was grim, Enik and Alex took off running. They had only each other. Like a man and his dog, a quintessential binding. With the authorities closing in fast, Alex and Enik made the hasty decision to cross the frozen Hudson. They made it out about 40 feet before the ice gave way. And they vanished, never to be seen or heard from again. All I can think of is that they were together. Side by side. Maybe holding hands. Staring deeply into each other's eyes as they drowned. Froze to death. Just staring. And knowing that no matter what, the master and his boy, their bond, their fate, was forever together. (heart beating) Who am I? I said who am I? Am I the master? Huh? Am I the master? (screaming) (zapping) Am I the master? Am! (screaming) (zapping) I! The! Master! (sobbing) And who are you? Who are you to me? Who are you? Come on. Who are you? Who are you?

(laughter) No, but really, just wanted to document my desires and I guess what I found out is that it's a mix between my fantasies and my hopes and some of my nightmares and everything that's ugly and beautiful in-between. - So Thomas, what inspired you? - Sometimes... Sometimes I don't work. I have a lot of time. I have this terrifying thought that no matter how hard I try to fight it or think otherwise, no matter how hard, how foreign it is for me to believe, I've come to realize that at my base, and at my core, I'm just an animal catering to my most primitive needs. To eat, drink, to fuck, to laugh, to love. I'm just a domesticated animal and a product of my parents, and my circumstances, and where I grew up, and where I live, and my society, and my education, and my just everything I can't control. Just parts of me I can't control. I'm just a product and an animal. (rhythmic drumming)
