Man needs to love the world some more. Because the earth, the wind, you know, the water, it's all gonna fade away. It's coming, man. I mean, your average Joe on the street now he doesn't care about the environment, okay, or pollution. I mean, your politicians, they're printing. George, you know, on the dollar bill. Man, they've got the pyramid, man, you know? - You know, the eye. - Yeah, the eye. The eye of Horus, man. The all-seeing thing, you know, it's on the bill. You know? And this is like they're saying, this is new God, worship this, man, yeah. Worship the money, you know. You know? But it doesn't exist. It doesn't exist, you know? The world, she's gonna die. Do we exist? We are beyond existence. I stand amid the roar of a surf-tormented shore and I hold within my hand grains of the golden sand. How few, yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep while I weep. While I weep. Oh God, can I not grasp them with a tighter clasp? Oh God, can I not save one from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream? Jay! - Please, please! - Don't move. Please, please! I have no mercy for you, bitch! Please! You can stop. You already killed me. Who the fuck do you think you are? I am the devil. And I'm here to do the devil's business. Fuck, fuck! Fucker! You're a fucker! Motherfucker! Persons, including actress, Sharon Tate, were found dead at the home of Miss Tate and her husband, screen director, Roman Polanski.

I, uh, couldn't deal with the world I was presented. Or, to be more specific, I couldn't deal with how I felt about the world I was presented. I think when we come into the world we're told this is how it works and this is what you do. And, uh... I guess I couldn't make sense of that. I just felt different than everyone else, more sensitive. Um... So, I did whatever I could to suppress my emotions. My drug of choice was heroin. Now that I'm clean and sober I'm learning to touch my emotions in a healthy way. So yeah, if I keep doing this, then I'll be okay. And, if not, then I'll just be clinging to that roller coaster, hoping I don't fly off the handle. But yeah, six months today, so... thanks. - Good job. - Thanks. So, you all moved in up on Cielo Drive? Yeah. Freaked out yet? Not yet. Do you think it's such a good idea to live in a place with such dark history? I'm working the steps. I'm in a good place. Yeah, but the first year of recovery is a particularly fragile time. If you put yourself in a position where you're surrounded with a lot of dark energy, you could get affected by it. Come on, Ann, that's not the big book talking. Okay, I admit, I have a passing interest in the supernatural. But it doesn't bother you? Living in a place where so many people died? We live in a country that's built on the deaths of countless Native Americans. You could throw a stone and land on an ancient Indian burial ground. You know, I've seen it all moving around, man. God does not exist! I'm the devil! But I'm no one. I'm the universe, man. I'm in my mind. The mind is everything, man. It moves and it flows. It flows like water. It was the whole world. It was moving and converging to one point of time. It was an altar, that's what it was, man. Shit! It was an altar. The world was changing and moving. So, what's the main inspiration behind the new album then, eh? Oh, hold on. Hello? Is that Charlie Manson? Yes, yes, it is, she's here. Yes, she's very interested and she wants to know all about the apocalyptic messages in your songs so she can write her next album. You know, if you read a book once in a while you would know that quite a number of people dispute the Helter Skelter motive. Oh, I'm very well-read, I'll have you know. Yeah, nudie mags and cereal boxes don't count, really. Some of my best songs were written and inspired by nudie mags and cereal packets. Well, I am shocked. But I'm with you, I'm with you. Are we going for it? Well, the whole "rich people must die because the lyrics warned of a race war" thing doesn't really fly with me, so I'm gonna do some research. Hold on. I've gotta have a wizz, alright? I should be back in two shakes of my snake. Hopefully. I sense a great sadness in you. Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. My name's Annabelle. I sense you have questions. Are you psychic or something? You could say I see beyond the physical realm. Um, look, my friend's gonna be back in a minute, so... I'm sorry, I understand if you'd prefer to be left alone. Thank you. Can I just leave you with one thing? What? It wasn't a dream. And a large force of more than 8,000 men today tightened its hold on the Bataan Peninsula on South Vietnam's central coast, trapping an undetermined number of... Crowe, man, what is happening? Take a seat. Hey, Rosina, get these guys a drink will ya? Sure. So, you got some business you wanna throw my way? I got a guy who wants to shift 10 keys. What's this cat's name? Come on, man, I can't tell you that. He's a friend of mine who just got into this shit. He ain't no dealer. He's all panicked, wants to move the stuff quick. How did he just get into this shit? Look, he's a friend of mine from Texas. He hooked up with this whore who scammed her pimp back home. She stole the 10 keys. He rang me up all panicked so I told him to come to L.A. and I'll take it off his hands. Where is he now? I set him up in a place on Coconut Grove. He don't wanna know anything about who's buying it. He just wants me to give him the money so he can get the fuck outta Dodge. Okay, so why you telling us this? 'Cause I ain't got the money. Wait, so you want me to put up my money so you can go buy 10 keys off of your friend? About right. You don't want a piece of the action of this? Look, man, I'm just the middle man. You give me the money, I go pay this guy and I give you the 10 keys. I just wanna help the guy out. Well, aren't you the good fucking Samaritan? Thanks, baby. Well, if it's as easy as you say it is, I'm interested. But let me fly straight with you. I don't trust you honkies. Especially not some honky motherfuckers be out here in the desert ripping off cars. I smell a rat. You smell a rat? A big old white rat. Well, look, if you got the money, we can go over there right now, get it done. It'll take five minutes. I'm offering you the most easy deal you've ever done, man. Okay, honky, I'll play ball. But if something don't sit right with me when we get there, I walk. My man right here, he'll make sure that you never do again. Can you dig it? Yeah, I dig it. Okay, okay, hang on, hang on. What? I told you, this guy don't wanna know anything about who's buying this shit. Are you fucking kidding me? Look, this guy ain't from our world, man. The less he knows about you, the better. It's a wise move not to show him your face. You want us to wait out here while you go inside there with my money? I'll be back in five minutes. If I ain't, knock the door, huh? - I got a better idea. - Yeah? Your girl here's gonna stay with us 'til you get back. You don't come back, or something don't sit right, this pretty little thing, she ain't gonna be so pretty no more. No, Tex, don't leave me here! It's fine, baby. Crowe, man, that's no problem. I'll be five minutes, baby. There's nothing to worry about here. Well, for her sake... there better not be, white boy. It's fine, baby. I'll be back in five minutes. Yeah? That Charles? This is Charles. That dope-dealing motherfucker from Texas? No, man, this is the other Charlie. Where's Tex at? I ain't seen him. Okay, well, his problem becomes your problem. Listen to this. Man, that girl don't sound like she's having a good time. Oh, she is having far from a good time. And it ain't gonna get any better, you hippie piece of shit. What you want me to do about it? Listen, I want my fucking money! Alright? Or I'm gonna come up to that ranch and kill you and every other hippie jive talkin' motherfucker. You understand me? I don't know nothin' about this, okay? But here's what we're gonna do. You and I, we'll resolve this thing. That's wonderful. 6933 Franklin Avenue, you've got an hour. Motherfucker! Oh yeah, he got the girl over here. That's cool. Hey, man, you know, yeah. That's a real nice shirt. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You are welcome! Hi, honey. I'm here, I'm here. I'm here, look at me. Look at me, just look at me. I'm here, okay? Okay, I'm here and I love you. I'm just gonna untie this girl here... What the fuck you doin'? I'm here to have a meeting, you know. Get out of my way. So, what I want you to do. Just take that, take it, okay. What I want you to do now is I want you to get that cute little ass of yours, okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, okay? Run along to the kitchen and just make us some coffee. Just get out of here, okay? Okay, yeah, well, wow, look at that. Wow, what a view you've got. You're the man, the guy I was talking to on the phone? Nice gentleman. No, he'll be right in. Oh, yeah, you gotta wait for him, huh? I bet he's always making you do that small shit. Oh yeah, I kind of thought you were the boss. That's what I naturally assumed, you know? - I mean, look at the... - Hey, man! What the fuck is she doing up and walking around, nigger? I told you to keep that bitch tied! Sit on down. Oh, you. Yeah. You fucking wise-ass motherfucker! You got my money? Whoo-wee-wee-wee! Wee-wee-wee, five grand, motherfucker! That's a lot of beans, motherfucker! I want my fucking money today! Uh-huh. Or I'm gonna ice this little bitch of yours. You dig? Um, yeah, yeah. Hey, no problem, yeah. Sorry about that. - Fuck! - Oh, I don't think so, you. Get the fuck away from me, go on, fuck off! Sit down! - Man, take the gun. - Don't move. Okay, take the gun. Okay, now, here's what I want you to do, okay? Look at me, man. I'm really sorry that I offended you. So, what I want you to do, I want you... Hey, hey, man. - Kill me, come on. - Hey, hey. Oh no, you wanna do it here. Is that where you wanna do it? Yeah, right in there, you know. You fucking idiot! - You little fuck! - Sit down! I'm down, I'm sitting down. You fuckers are all the same, you know! Oh, you see me coming in you think I'm some kind of dope smoking hippie! I ain't no fucking hippie, man! That's not my trip! You know who I am, huh? You know who I am? Do you know who I am? Fuck what you're gonna do! I'll tell you what I'm gonna do! Before I leave you will be dead and I'm gonna take the fucking girl! You're fucking mine man, huh, huh? Okay, white boy. You might get away today, but someday, me and my boy we're comin' up to that ranch and we're gonna kill you and every other hippie motherfucker that we see up in that bitch! You dig? I told you, I ain't no fucking hippie, motherfucker! Motherfucker! Look what you made me do, motherfucker! Alright? That's the way, Charlie. You know why I came here? That's a nice shirt there, man. Fuck this! I'm the guy who owns your life. Death don't mean shit. Take it off. The shirt? You want the shirt? Shirt's coming off, man. You can have the shirt. I don't give a fuck about the shirt. Alright? Just take the shirt. Here, I don't need it. I don't need it. It's yours, man, take the shirt. Take the shirt and go. Mmm, you smell good. Just like a guy I knew when I was 17. Pleasure doing business with you. Let's go. I'll tell you what, it's like a morgue in here, man. I mean, I know you're off it. I know that and I'm glad for you. But I'm not. - Go on and play me something. - Yeah, you're not, I know. - Play me something. - What are you on right now? - Deep and interesting. - Something deep and interesting. Fuck, I don't. - Expensive. - Okay, seriously, seriously. I've been working on something. Ah, alright. But I need you to play for me so just, I don't know I've got a couple chords... But I can't play the fucking REM shit. It's about as deep as Danzig. - T.J.? - Yeah? - No, I'm listening. - No, I know, but I've known you for a long time and you just... Oh, God! That's yesterday's tea, - you don't wanna drink that. - No, I don't. Look, I haven't been sleeping very well. - Can you just... - Oh, no! You've got this fucking, like, Manson shit going on in your head all the time! Manson shit? - No. - Yeah! No, I'm just... So what you waiting for? I'm just trying to go a different direction and I need your support, like actual, real support. Can you just come down to earth for a second, please? - Dark. - Dark. Okay, you want something dark? Let's do something different, give us a new thing. Okay, I'm digging. I'm kind of still drunk. Okay, you and the booze, man. It's fine, cool, just, there's coffee, you can sober up after.

Yeah. Is there anything else I should know? Like what? Like have you ever had any reports of ghostly sightings or anything like that? Have you seen something? Yeah. Well, uh, I guess you know what happened in '69? Yeah, that's not what I've seen. Did anything else ever happen in the house before or after '69? Actually, there was something. What happened? One of the first couples to occupy the house back in the '50s, they were newlyweds. The bride found out that the groom had cheated on her. So the story goes after the marriage was consummated and he fell asleep, she stabbed him in bed with a knife from the kitchen. The whole story was hushed up and never talked about. Would have sent the real estate value plummeting. Some of my girlfriends who occupied the house over the years have said they saw a woman. A woman dressed in a black wedding dress. "The bride in black" they called her. But I gotta tell you, Margot, as a friend, I wouldn't go too far down that rabbit hole. Some crazy shit goes on up in these hills. Why do you think they call it Hollyweird? Some people think it's best to let sleeping dogs lie. So what can I do for you, Miss Lavigne? Right, so I'm actually, this might seem strange. Uh, I'm here about a famous case from 1969. Yeah, it's a little bit before my time. I figured. It's the Tate murders at Cielo Drive. You're familiar? You'd have to have lived under a rock for years not to be. What about it? The case files, the public case files, say the LAPD took rolls of film from the attic at the house. Okay. I'm living at that house now and I, uh, I guess I have a personal interest. So I was just wondering whether they're still in evidence or, if not, if anyone knew what was on the rolls of film. I've never heard of that before. I'll tell you what, if you leave me your number, I can check up on it for you and maybe give you a call in the morning and let you know what I find. That'd be great. - Can I use your pen? - Yeah, of course. Thanks. This is my number at the house. Right, so, I can expect your call? I'll give you a call. ♪ Hearts in the night ♪ ♪ Fear by her side ♪ ♪ Every girl must hide ♪ ♪ From the bride in black ♪ Hello? Margot Lavigne? Yeah. It's Detective David O'Halloran. Oh, hi. Listen, so I checked up on those rolls of film you asked about and they're no longer here at the station, but apparently they were booked into evidence at one point. I don't know what happened to them, perhaps they were returned to the house or the former owners. No, they're not at the house. Does it say who logged them in and out of evidence? Sure, same guy did both, actually. His name's Randone, Ted Randone. Thank you, that is great. I really appreciate that. Hey, I know this is kind of forward, but, uh, would you like to go for a drink with me sometime? I, uh, I don't drink. You drink coffee? Sure. Wanna grab a coffee with me? Yeah, okay. You find dating difficult? Usually as soon as I tell someone I don't drink or do drugs they just tune out. Really? Yeah. Most people are, for the social life, they don't really... It makes them uncomfortable when you're not into that. You know, um, I once dated an addict. Oh. Well, I'd ask you how that went, but seeing as you're here I'm guessing not so well. Well, I met her at the tail end of her addiction. So I kind of helped her get into recovery. Well, I mean, she did it, of course, but I'd like to think I helped a little bit. I'm sure you did. Then when she got clean we kind of grew apart. It got a little scary at times, but, you know, I gotta give her a break on that. I know recovery is like learning to live all over again. She seemed to be quite a resentful person, though. I think she really struggled with that. Well, in recovery they say that resentment is a number one offender. People can be sober for years, but if they harbor resentments, one day the house of cards comes tumbling down. So, it is a tough thing to go through. Well, you certainly don't make it any easier on yourself. What do you mean? Living in the Manson murder house? I mean, come on. It's a creative thing. I don't know, the music I'm writing, the themes I'm circling, it just... feels right. There's something there. I don't know what it is, but I can sense it. Yeah. Well, it takes a lot of bravery to do that. Hello? This Margot? It is, yeah. You left a message with my wife. Name's Randone. Oh, thank you for calling me back. Yeah, right, listen, let's get something straight from the off, so no one wastes anyone's time. Okay. I'll talk to anyone, but I don't talk for free. You want information you better be prepared to pay for it. How much? Five grand. That's pretty steep. Risk versus reward. Time may have passed, but the shit I could tell you about those tapes might still get me clipped. Can you meet tomorrow morning? Yeah, Franklin Park, tennis court, 7 a.m. I'll be the guy in the red button-up. Oh, and I don't take checks. Margot? Randone. You got the money? You're that singer. Pay me five grand and I'll answer your questions. Alright. You wanna know what was on those rolls of film we seized from Cielo Drive? Yeah. Sex stuff, mostly. Between who? Mostly it's a bunch of celebrities, orgies, whatnot. You still own the rolls of film? No, a couple of those actors who were in that film bought 'em from me for a hell of a lot more than five grand, I can tell you. A couple of those guys had reps for being tough leading men. They weren't so tough or leading, in those films, if you get what I mean. So it was just sex stuff, mostly? No, not quite. There's, uh, there's one film that's real fucking strange. How so? It's a ritual, like a black mass kind of thing. I have no idea who the people are in it. They're all wearing dark robes with hoods. You can't see their faces, but basically, they're doing some kind of satanic service or some shit, right there in the house. Do you think it was shot at the same time as the sex stuff? Sit down, for fuck's sake. Was it filmed the same time as the sex party? I don't know. The house looks different. The film stock is a lot older. It could have been filmed years before the Manson family went up there. A lot of people have lived there over the years. Do you think that the Manson family was into that cult shit? I know the District Attorney liked to peddle all that cult crap, but I gotta tell you, anyone who was around in '69 knew what really went down. Yeah, there was a hell of a lot of innocents caught in the crossfire, but the main players in that whole circle, well, let's put it this way: you live freaky, you die freaky. Nice doing business with you. I'm organizing this huge party and I'm after some LSD. How much? A thousand tabs. Shit, that's a lot, man. More than we got here. You know anyone else who sells in bulk? Yeah, a guy I know called Hinman. He helps us out from time to time. He's got his own lab. Can turn shit around pretty quick. What kind of price we talking? A thousand bucks. If the turnaround is gonna be quick, I'm happy with that. I'll give him a call. You can move somewhere but there ain't nowhere you can go. The universe, man, is just spinning around and... Your buddy sold me shit! What the fuck are you talking about? It was fucking shit! A couple of my guys keeled over on that fucking stuff! Why the fuck you comin' to me? The guy's usually okay! You think I'm a fucking idiot, huh? Uh, man... Back off, pal! Man, man, look, look, okay, okay, alright? You're being really negative, man. Alright, don't be negative, okay? It's a beautiful day. There's a load of beautiful girls around here. We got some wine and stuff, you know. I'm not in the mood for socializing, pal. Right. - Okay. - Back the fuck off. Alright, okay, okay. If this guy, you know, he agrees with you. If he agrees with you and he says that it's really bad shit, it's a bad trip, whatever, okay? Mm-hmm. He, him, will make it up to you. - Yeah? - I'll give you one week. One week. To get me the good shit I paid for or my money back. You got that? Right, two days. I got it. Come on, you, my soul. One week, motherfucker, - one fucking week! - Come on! - Fucking crazy motherfucker. - Come on! Yeah, huh? Bobby. Guess I better go see Hinman, huh? Look Gary, you sold me bunk! And now I gotta get the money back. There's no two ways about it. It's a really bad scene. Look Bobby, I can appreciate you're in a right tight spot, dude. But, I never had complaints about my shit before. And plus, those guys didn't give me any of the tabs back to check out. So, why? It looks like they're trying to fucking rip me off. I ain't giving them shit. And anyway, I spent all the money, Bobby. I got, like, $20 dollars to my name, man. So you're just gonna let them fucking kill me? 'Cause that's what they're gonna do, Gary! What can I say, Bobby? It's a real fucking tough business out there, pal! Fuck! Bobby, Bobby! Fuck! Sadie, hold the gun on this motherfucker! Don't do it, Bobby! I'm gonna tear this house apart and get that fucking money! What the fuck you doing? You crazy fuck! What the fuck you doing to my head, man? - Fuck, Sadie! - Bobby, Bobby! Bobby, he's got the gun! Goddamn it, Gary! Be cool, man! Just be quiet, you stop it! Be cool, man! Get the fuck up right now, Gary! Get up! Come on, come on. Come on, Gary. Bruce, it's Sadie. We need your help over at Hinman's. Things are getting out of hand. Come on, come on. Goddamn it, Gary, you gotta have something here worth some fucking money! What are you doing? Where the fuck you going? What are you doing? Whoa, whoa, whoa! I got a car out front, man. It's easily worth a thousand bucks. You fucking take that car and you fucking fly, dude! Just fuck off, man! Look, man... Get your fucking hands off me, man. I'm sorry I had to be this way. Those guys are gonna fucking kill me. Are you expecting someone? No, man. Look, Gary, we're gonna be leaving soon. So just make your excuses and get rid of whoever it is, okay? What the fuck you doing, Bobby? I swear, I'm gonna be out of your hair. You're never gonna have to see me again, okay? Oh, shit! Motherfucker! - Huh, huh? - What the fuck, man? I got something for you! What the fuck is that, man? - Huh, huh? - No, no, no! He's just given us a car to pay the money back! Shut the fuck up! I should kill you right now, motherfucker, and show you that death, it ain't no thing, man! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's nothing, you know? Death is just, you walk into another bridge. You're going to another dimension. You're just lying there like a scared motherfucker full of fear! You don't need to be frightened of death. Living, that's what you wanna be frightened of. You wanna be frightened of living. Beautiful thing, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing. Have a nice day. Shit! Fuck, Bobby. I need a fucking ambulance, man. Get some towels! I need a fucking ambulance, man! What's it look like, man? - How bad is it, man? - It's fine. Come on, put some pressure on this, okay? Put some pressure on it. Bobby, I need an ambulance, man. I can't do that, Gary. The cops are gonna come and we're all gonna get busted. Fuck, fuck, Bobby! I swear I won't say anything, man. I'll just say I was in a bar fight. - I'm sorry, Gary. - Bobby, please. I'm really sorry, Gary. I didn't want it to be this way. Fuck, what, Bobby, Bobby! You fuck... I gave them something that they didn't have. These are all rejects of your society, man. You wanna throw 'em away, all over the place. I just picked them up. I gave them freedom, you know? Freedom, that's what I am, that's what I represent. So, you wanna ask me? You know nothing. But in here, man, in here. Put me in a darkened room. To you it's the end. To me it's just the beginning, man. I'm swirling around the midsts of time and I am in my mind! And I'm free. I won't die, I'm immortal. Jesus! Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? We met at the cafe. Right, yeah. Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. I just felt like there's something you should know. Do you wanna come in? Maybe we could go elsewhere. Perhaps the cafe? Sure, yeah, let me grab my keys. I've been thinking a lot about what you said, that it wasn't a dream. What did you mean by that? The Big Bang did not happen once but many, many times. It was an event of such extraordinary magnitude that it caused echoes of itself to occur on slightly different planes of existence. Each universe is created slightly differently. So, when they grew and evolved, they would gradually grow apart. Sometimes in subtle ways and sometimes in drastic ways. We all have our own personal timeline. But when we make a decision we create a parallel timeline. So you could choose to turn right but then you make a decision later on which takes you to the left. Do you follow? What does this have to do with what's happening in the house? Ghosts aren't the spirit of dead people. They are inter-dimensional projections of people who are very much alive in another timeline. You see, time is not linear, even though we pretend it is. Time does not, in fact, exist. You see, these timelines and visions that we see are other timelines moving into our present timeline. We are catching a glimpse of the other side. I've never experienced these things before, so... Why are they happening now on Cielo Drive, why? Have you heard of ley lines? No. You see, there are energy ley lines and true ley lines. Energy ley lines are fractures in the Earth's crust. But true ley lines, they are straight trader's tracks. You see, there are five pre-aligned, pre-Reformation sacred sites on them. One of these lines runs below that house on Cielo Drive. When two ley lines cross, or intersect, a vortex of negative energy is created. Energy's entities can feed off this lower vibrational spirit and begin to manifest. 10050 Cielo Drive is a place where two such ley lines cross, an intersect, a vortex of negative energy. They can also affect people. So why me? Am I attracting this? The lore of attraction states that we are attracting what we are sending out. So, positive energies attract positive and negative energies attract negative. Am I attracting these entities? Fate and destiny are palpable elements in the universe. Our timelines are predetermined. You need to look at yourself and consider whether staying in that house is a good idea. There are always signs given to us about our fate. The key is to see those signs. Hello? Hey, how's it going? Earlier, I saw you. You were on the driveway, you were crying. I came out to see you, you took off. I didn't come to your place earlier. Quit pulling my chain, I saw you.

I don't want to go through this again. I've made my choice and I'm sticking with it. You told me he lies! And you pretend to believe him. It isn't always easy. But I don't regret it because he's given me this baby. Some things are just fated. Oh, friends from Chatsworth. Come in, come in. Jay's in the living room. Good evening, all. How are we? I'll be in my room if you need me. Okay. I thought you said she was gonna be in Europe? Her husband is. But don't worry, she's cool. We've got an understanding. Uh-huh. Anyone in the guest house? Some kid's been hanging out with Bill. Why, you wanna party? Not tonight, man. We gotta get back. So, how much do you want? All of it. Tex, what the fuck, man? Just bag it all up and shut the fuck up. Katie, come on, there's no need for this! Shut up and do what he says! You guys are in real trouble here. You know who we are connected to? Shut up, you Polack piece of shit! What's going on? Tex! I'll go after her, you watch these three. Please. Please help us. Inside. Now! Move! Move! Sit down! Were those gunshots? Shut up! Alright. We're gonna take a trip to that place you got up on Easton Drive. Just take me, you don't need her! Don't dictate to me, you fucking maggot! I'm the one who's holding all the cards here. Who the fuck do you think you are? I am the devil. And I'm here to do the devil's business. Watch her and the Polack. These two are coming on a little ride. Move! Move! What was that? I'll go find out. Watch him. Don't move! Please, please. I have no mercy for you, bitch. Look, why don't we take it easy... Hey, sit the fuck down! Sit down, sit the, fuck! Please, please. Please. Please, please. - Shh, shh. - No! You can stop. You've already killed me. Fuck you! Go find the Polack. Fuck. You gonna die. You're gonna fucking die, motherfucker. You fucker! You fuck! You're a fucker! What happened after you left? So, we, uh, we showered off using the neighbor's hose pipes and changed clothes. Neighbors see you? Uh-huh, but it was fine, man. We got out of there quick and he had no idea where we'd been, man. And then we dropped the clothes and the bloody weapons down that sheer drop at Benedict Canyon. Fuck, man! What the fuck? Motherfucker, you trying to stick me the fuck back inside? I don't wanna go in the joint anymore, man! You know what I did to get out here? Everything we've done to crawl up from the shit? Motherfucker! I'm sorry, man, look. I know I fucked up. Soon as I get on the crank shit just escalate's you know? I'm sorry, man, come on. I love you, man. I love you too, man. I do. I'm sorry, man, I am. I'm real sorry. This is what we're gonna do. What, man? Old Charlie, he's gonna rise up and clean your shit. We're gonna go back there. Yeah, okay. - Clean everything up. - Uh-huh. Oh, shit. You motherfucker. This is fucked up is what it is, man. No man, this is the end. Mankind, he's gonna kill himself. Hey, I got you some coffee. Thanks. Are you hungry? Not really. I know, but will you try eating for me? Yeah. Thank you. I'll head to the grocery store and I'll pick up a few things and I'll come back and I'll make us something. Okay? Annie, what... There are always signs given to us about our fate. The key is to see those signs. I once dated an addict. It got a little scary at times. She seemed to be quite a resentful person, though. It wasn't a dream. The thing about freedom is, real freedom, it's something they wanna take away from you. Now, the way they take that away from you, okay, is by creating fear. - Oh. - Yeah. The confusion... and the chaos and your fractured realities and your subdivisions, you know, all that. Yeah. It's more than they can handle. You can take a pile of rocks and you can choose to build a house. Or you can take that same pile of rocks and you can choose to make a war. Alright? And the government, they're telling the kids, don't throw any rocks, and they're making all these rules and these regulations. But what they're doing, they're driving the people crazy. For all of us, the conventional world hasn't worked. Death is the biggest trip of all, right, Charlie? There is no death. Death is just an extension, you know? You're just going to another place. Your eyes are an ocean. And your soul... is my universe. This is a song about something that I'm not even thinking about.
