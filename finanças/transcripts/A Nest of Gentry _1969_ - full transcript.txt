Your name is Anton, isn't it? So you're still alive. As you see, my dear sir, Fyodor lvanovich, l'm still alive. Have been waiting for you for 1 5 years now. Eleven. I got ill last winter, but I said to myself, you can't yet die. I had served your father. And your grandfather, faithfully and truly. So I must wait for Fyodor lvanovich. - where's my mother's portrait? - Your mother's? Grishka! Give me the ring. I can't. A souvenir from Paris. - Grishka! - Oui, Monsieur! Oui, Monsieur. There was no portrait of your mother. what do you mean, there was no portrait? I remember it. No, Fyodor lvanovich. The portraits were painted only on your father's side, the gentry's side. And your mother, excuse me, was a house serf before her marriage. Akulina, go! - And you go too! - Oui, Monsieur. There was a portrait. You forgot it. There was a small picture in the bedroom. - In the bedroom? - Your mother's bedroom. Do you remember this one too? How can I not remember your great- grandfather Andrei Afanasyevich? He was a real master. He knew no superiors. He'd left so much wealth after him. The theatre, it was he who built it. Sure enough, a real grandee, the head of the Lavretskys House. As for your grandfather, they lived not so well. He'd spent all the money, not leaving a single silver spoon. Though he was very daring and cruel at heart. He almost killed your father when he decided to get married. Your father had the folly to say: ''l'm marrying Malania, the maid.'' I was serving at that dinner, and almost dropped a tray. Your grandfather rolled his eyes and began to tug on the tablecloth with all the dishes. we thought he had a stroke. But instead he shouted: ''l'll curse you! I'll disinherit you! Malania is to be flogged! And sent to a distant village!'' That very night your father kidnapped Malania, galloped off with her to town and married her there. The next day he sent your grandfather a letter which your grandfather didn't even read. He was so upset that he took to bed. The whole province was buzzing with the news of a nobleman marrying a house maid. But your mother, though common, was an intelligent woman. She learned how to read. we called her Malania Sergeyevna. She pined for your father very much when he went abroad. She lived upstairs, in the attic. That was where she died. why is this nailed up? Have it opened. And where does your wife choose to live now, sir? I am separated from my wife. Please don't ask me about her. You can go now. Fyodor lvanovich, your wife has conquered the entire Paris. Not many Russians could achieve this. I was brought to Paris from voronezh. can you imagine what an uncouth log I was. what it takes other people years to do, your wife has assimilated instantly. She has that artistic sense which we Russians usually lack. It's so admirable! You're a lucky husband. Fyodor, let me introduce to you Monsieur Jules, a man of letters who wrote about my musical soirees. The whole Paris is talking about your salon. I can't believe that you managed to lure in the great maestro. I'm sure he's in love with your wife, just as we all are. By her mentality, Madame is a French woman. Is it true that l'm back? Is it true that l'm home at last? As happiness is impossible without love, so can be neither peace nor freedom without your native land. Man is much more like a plant than he thinks. A plant and its roots can't live being torn from its native soil. And if it's so, not all has been lost yet. Oh God, how many times I thought l'd already comprehended it all. One really has to get his head smashed against the wall. My family life has failed, l'll never be able to build myself a nest. The most important thing is not to be torn from your native land. Not soil, but precisely land. There is the Kalitins' house. I wonder how they will receive me. christofor Teodorovich! Do you remember your most untalented pupil? would you like to go again to my... Lavriki? To Lavriki? with pleasure, Fyodor lvanovich. And this must be the youngest one, Lenochka? Yes. Remember how you asked me to name the melody and I couldn't? Yes. You don't recognize me? But I remembered you. I am Lavretsky. - lsn't your name Elisaveta? - Yes. I remember you perfectly, although it's 1 1 years since I saw you last. You were a child then. Is your mother at home? Mother heard about your arrival. She's in the garden, with Sergey Petrovich. what a strong wind. Here comes Maman. How are you, my dear cousin? I don't believe my eyes. verenitsyna told me you were back in Russia, but I didn't believe her. You know that verenitsyna... How are you, my good cousin? verenitsyna, our neighbor. You were in town paying visits. Shame on you for being in town and not visiting us. How glad I am to see you! Let me introduce you to my daughter Lisa. I have already introduced myself to Elisaveta Mikhailovna. And this is Sergey Petrovich Gedeonovsky, a colleague of my late husband, our old friend, a very nice man, a State councilor. Mamma, mamma! vladimir Nikolayevich is riding! what a lovely horse he has! Oh, vladimir Nikolayevich! He always invents something new. You know, dear cousin, this year we have so many guests from the capital. Sergey Petrovich, come here! Good afternoon, Maria Dmitrievna! How do you like my new purchase? Good afternoon, vladimir Nikolayevich! what a beautiful horse! Don't you think vladimir Nikolayevich is a very agreeable young man? He looks like a Frenchman. He has a teasing streak. Between ourselves, he's madly in love with my Lisa. - A brilliant officer. - Retired. And he isn't a bit arrogant. He's well regarded in the highest circles. He's on business here. From the Ministry of the lnterior. I'm sure, if he wanted, he could in time become a Minister. Yes. And what do you think of my Lisa? Elisaveta Mikhailovna is a beautiful girl. For pity's sake! It's just incredible! The factory-owner Sitnikov asked two thousand for the horse, the scoundrel! And such a stupid name - Pegasus. Dear cousin, please meet vladimir Nikolayevich Panshin. And this is Monsieur Fyodor lvanovich Lavretsky. where are you going, christofor Teodorovich? My head aches. Do stay, we will have a talk about Shakespeare. My head aches. why are you laughing at the old man? The samovar is ready! Anfisa, serve us tea. Gentlemen, dear cousin, come to the table, please. Only to think how long it is since we last met... where have you come from now? where have you left... that is, I meant to say... You wanted to ask where I have left my wife? I've left my wife in Paris. I have just come from ltaly. I mean, right now from Lavriki. I returned from Rome five days ago. I say, ladies and gentlemen, Paris is indeed a corrupted city. A real Babylon. I'll never forget my youthful days. And what about Marfa Timofeyevna? Is she alive? Auntie is upstairs, having her tea. why are you pouring such a strong tea for me? why, there's Fedya! It's really Fedya! Let me have a look at you. Ah, you look splendid. You've grown older, but you've not changed for the worse. But why do you kiss my hand? Kiss me properly, if my wrinkled cheeks aren't disagreeable to you. Nastasya Karpovna, tell them to pick up fresh strawberries. Shurochka will help you. why did you put the music on? Naughty child! - will you stay with us for long? - For good. For good. I'll live at Lavriki. Of course, one feels dislocated when living abroad. - And why do you look so gloomy? - l'm ashamed. Ashamed of what? You're not one to blame. A husband is always to blame if his wife behaves badly. I always said that there's no good in those marriages of yours for love. I loved her so much, auntie! I would have forgotten everything, I would've even forgiven her if she... why haven't you brought varvara here then? It's too late. It's been four years already since we parted. I've come back to my country. I want to recover from all that glitter and thunder. You're so unlucky, Fedya. Just as your mother was unlucky in love. She was an angel, though she was a common woman. I remember how your father brought her to us late at night. He brought her, and he said: ''My father has cursed me because I married a house maid.'' And I saw her standing in the porch, so frightened. He said: ''will you take us in... '' ''come here,'' he said to her, ''hastily ennobled lady.'' - Do you remember your mother? - Yes, I do. All right, enough of that. She was pure gold, your mother. So quiet and timid. She expired in a few days. Expired like some tender shrub torn from its native soil, with its roots upturned to the sun. Pardon. varyusha, don't be angry. I understand that you love society and its glitter. But why invite that journalist, Monsieur Jules? I want to go to Rome. That Monsieur Jules... That insolent and cringing man, like most duelists and flogged men are. He has a scandalous reputation. And I like society scandals. Be careful, or you'll tear it. what's the matter with you? what's the matter? Tell me, what's the matter? Let's go home, to Lavriki. we'll take walks in the woods. we'll cook jam. No. - well, l'd better go. - wait a bit more... - what shall I wait for? - I picked some flowers for you. Field ashberry... It's good for the calves. And this is... mint... It helps from scrofula... And these are forget-me-nots... Life is passing. I miss Paris so much. Oh, the German! In this unhurried life, one begins to think differently. And - strange to say - all bad melts away in your heart... Like snow in spring. can you see vladimir Nikolayevich? why didn't you invite me to play. You? Do you remember what's written in the Scriptures? If a man lives many years, Iet him rejoice in them all. Though it's also said in the Scriptures that he should remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. And what is this? Yesterday you played something l'm not familiar with. was it yours? Ah, that's nothing. what about writing an opera? You'll write the music, and I a libretto. An opera? No, that is beyond me. Already my strength has gone. The only thing I should content myself with is a romance. But I should like good words. Something of this kind. O stars, pure stars! O stars, pure stars! You look down alike on the righteous and on... However, l'm no poet. I'm sorry l'm not a poet either. well, it's time for dinner. - From Paris. - Roquefort! Maestro, I think you will soon have to compose a festive cantata. On what occasion? On that of Monsieur Panshin's marriage to Elisaveta Mikhailovna. - That will not be! - why not? Because it is impossible. Elisaveta Mikhailovna is a serious girl, but he is a man of no principle. with no ideals. Though everything is possible in Russia. why shouldn't I invite Elisaveta Mikhailovna to come here for the day with her mother and sister? Invite her. - But we needn't ask Panshin? - No, we needn't. Grishka! Anton! Grishka! Anton! where are you all? Anton, send a man to the Kalitins with my letter. You haven't knocked it off yet. I told you to long ago. - Yes, sir. I'll call Mikhey now. - You're all hopeless! My parents had paid little attention to me. I was brought up by my nurse. She was an amazing creature! If anyone spoke rudely to her, she only bowed her head and gave thanks for the lesson. It was she who taught me to pray. She took me to the early service in secret. I remember it was still dark when l, half-asleep, was dressed and taken to church. The snow was blue, my cheek still crumpled from a pillow. The cold is crawling up my sleeves, and I see the church before me. And the golden light comes from the church, it's warm inside. why did you stop talking? You must forgive me. I have no right to speak to you of this, but you're so good. why did you separate from your wife? I know, she's guilty before you, but you should forgive her. Forgive her? You don't even know... I would've forgiven her if she herself had admitted she was unfaithful. And what makes you think that she wants to return to me? But what is the good of talking about her? You should forgive. You should. Because without forgiveness your soul will remain without God. where's Madame? I've just seen such a beautiful butterfly... Give me the plaid. It was all green, with little red spots. This is the person I love more than anyone else in the world. Did you hear that angel say that she loves old Lemm most of all? And you complain that you're unlucky. - Did you hear it? - Let's go, or you'll catch a cold. To hear such words from that heavenly creature... - what happened? - My wife has died. ''The delightful, enchanting Moscow lady, the queen of Paris salons, Madame de Lavretsky, has died quite suddenly.'' You know I never liked your wife. But how awful it is to die far from your home. Oh God, why should I stay in your Russia? For 40 years I continued to seek my fortune here, and became a beggar. I no longer hope for anything. You know, l'm afraid of dying here, never seeing my Germany again. Let's go away from here. Just the two of us. Tomorrow. No, right away. Grishka! Let's go to Switzerland. Anton! No, better to ltaly. No, to Germany! Do you remember what you taught me? That's all fantasies, my young friend. You won't go anywhere. You don't have to go anywhere. - why not? - You're a free man now. But what am I to do with my freedom? I know everything. Only two weeks ago you didn't need your freedom, but now you need it very much. Oh, for God's sake, don't say that. It's too late for me. It's never late to hope for happiness. Good evening, my dear friends. I'm so glad to see you. Just look at this charming creature. Princess Maria Nikolayevna Gagarin. Good evening. - You don't speak Russian? - Precisely! She was born and brought up here. A native of Penza, she doesn't speak a word of Russian. It's outrageous! It's my honor to introduce to you Monsieur Ernest de Bouvoir who hasn't yet mustered the courage to invite a lady for a waltz, without being introduced to her and her husband. My wife has died. It makes me so frightened. You must have realized only now how much you loved her. Your face... Iooks so strange. At least I am now a free man. what use is your freedom to you? You should think now of forgiveness. Oh, Elisaveta Mikhailovna, believe me... I have been punished enough already. For four years now my life have been poisoned. I'm a man... who has lived his life. You must not think so. It's a sin. You're still alive, and she's no more. I'm unable to hide anything from you. And I hope you will repay me with an equal confidence. Do you think so? In that case I should feel obliged to ask for your advice. But no. Speak, speak. - Lisa, look at that whistle! - There's a lot of raspberries there! Speak up. I received a letter this morning. - From Panshin? - How did you know? - He asks you to be his wife? - Yes. well... You're undertaking such a terrible responsibility to the man whom you do not love and to whom you are ready to belong. And you, Fyodor lvanovich... You married for love, and were you happy? I was happy. It seems to me that love will never bring me happiness. I implore you, don't marry without love! No, love will never being me happiness. The guardian angel sent to us down from heaven. Rejoice at the Birthgiver of God, O Thou who alone loveth mankind. - who ordered the special service? - Marfa Timofeyevna. Not at all, it was Elisaveta Mikhailovna who ordered it. O Lord! Forgive me, O Lord! Forgive me for not having come to you for such a long time. I beg You to save my soul and deliver it of all malice and anger. Send onto me, O Lord, the grace of humility. And I also pray for the repose of my late wife. O Lord, do you hear me? I thank Thee for my recovered hope, for my beloved Russia. O christ, our only true God by the pure prayers of Your mother... It is so long since we have been alone together. - You seem to be frightened of me. - Yes. - Please tell me why? - Don't ask me about anything. I... know nothing. I don't even know myself. - How are you, Marfa Timofeyevna? - Ah, it's you, Fedya! - what's the matter with you? - Please, don't even ask. what happened? That Petersburg shuffler came for a final answer. The two of them will do the poor girl in. Her mother seems to be dying to move to Petersburg. So they're sitting there, waiting for her to give her immediate consent. Nastasya Karpovna! Nastasya Karpovna! I can't bear it. I just can't. And you serve French wine for dinner. why? I don't reject everything. I love Paris, and I believe that Russia must catch up to France, but... what is good for France, is no good for Russia. Russia is in slumber. we have only become half-Europeans. Do you suggest to make Russians wholly European? Yes. I met such Russian Europeans in Paris. A young girl, Princess Gagarin, doesn't know a word of Russian. Everything Russian is alien to her. what a monstrous contradiction between blood and breed, and the language and thoughts. with time that contradiction will be leveled out. It's too boring to argue on that subject. Thank God that the people don't listen to those arguments. well, I can understand that such a long absence could have made you nostalgic for Russian kvass. But only the most reactionary conservative can explain our seclusion, our insusceptibility to western influences by the mystery of a Slavic soul. For God's sake, there's no mystery. It's just the lack of civilization. And it has been understood. If Khomyakov himself admits it... Oh God, we're so fond of mysteries and signs. Give us a little time and your white- headed... That is all very fine. It's fine that you returned from France with such a strong conviction. But what do you intend to do? To plough the land. And to try to plough it as well as possible. And you think you're capable to do it? Dear Mistress Maria Dmitrievna. Elisaveta Mikhailovna asks you to come to her. Excuse me, gentlemen. The circumstances demand that I leave you. come on, Rex. Let's not disturb the gentlemen. voldemar. Lisa doesn't feel well. She asks you to excuse her. - She will give her answer tomorrow. - well... If I may, l'll come again tomorrow. why, dear cousin? why? why is she doing that? why does she want to kill me? why should she think it over and wait? what better man could she want? Did Elisaveta Mikhailovna refuse Panshin? No, of course not. But her indecisiveness is unbearable. She will drive me mad. In Petersburg he could marry any maid of honor he wanted. He has a house on Fontanka. Doesn't she want to go to Petersburg? There's some anxiety in her every movement, even in her laughter. And just look at me! Languishing away like a boy. No, I want to see her. we must talk. All the rest is rubbish. when on a spring day you, my angel so obedient, Approach me, after coming from a walk, And stretch to me your hand, your smile simple and radiant, with flowers of my choice you stocked, I'm looking at your face with so new a sense of satisfaction, I can't enjoy enough that God- inspired view... And in my hardened soul, love and affection Are being sacredly preserved only for you. Good night, Auntie. It's dawn already. I can't pretend any longer not to have noticed anything. what's the matter, Auntie? what's the matter? Shurochka told me everything. She saw you kissing with that old sinner, with that so-called humble man. And don't try to deny it. I don't deny it. - Perhaps you love him. Do you? - I love him. Lisa, he's a middle-aged man, he's a widower. well, I don't deny that he's a good man, he doesn't bite. But we're all good people. There will always be plenty of good people in the world. I'll love him forever. - But it's nothing. - Nothing? why, just look at yourself, Lisa. what has happened to your face? where have your eyes gone? - lt's such a misfortune. - No, Auntie. Love is happiness, too. A great happiness. But that happiness is not for me. Something calls me... away... what? what calls you away? Speak up, answer me! Sins. My sins... and those of other people... I don't know. I must redeem all that, must pray away. what is it all about, my dear? Answer me! Speak! Nothing. what's on your mind, my child? Tell me. Tell me please, don't frighten me. Don't look at me like that, child. Don't. Or I shall shriek, l'll burst into tears. It's raining. Everything will be all right, Auntie. Lisa! Lisa! I love you! I'm ready to give my whole life for you. what is it? Lisa! Lisa! can it be that you love me? we shall be happy! Don't drive me away, Fyodor! Fyodor lvanovich, please hear me out. I am guilty before you. I've... made up my mind to break every link with the past. I... I was so ill. I took advantage of the report about my alleged death. I left everything. Believe me, I could have plucked up enough courage to take my life. But the thought of you... You are going away? what do you want from me? Tell me what I should do and where I should live. Madam, there's no reason why we should be hypocritical to each other. Get out! I don't believe in your repentance. But even if it were genuine it is impossible for me to rejoin you and live with you again. And now more than ever. Have mercy on me... what's the matter with you? Justine! Grishka! I'm here, sir. where's the mistress? She ordered a carriage in the morning. - where to? - She said, to the Kalitins. - what?! - To the Kalitins. Lisa! - wait. - Please, don't. All is over. Yes. Over before it could begin. we must do our duty, Fyodor lvanovich. You should try to make peace with your wife. Lisa! For God's sake! You're asking the impossible. I agree to anything. I have forgotten the past. But I can't do such violence to my heart... Don't live with her if you don't wish to, but be reconciled with her. Do this for my sake. very well. Suppose I do this. And fulfil my duty. But what do you think your duty is? I know it well. Are you going to marry Panshin? I'll go into a convent. Lisa... come to your senses. what on earth are you thinking of? I prayed, I sought advice from God. I have made up my mind. You're ill, you're raving. You're ill. Happiness wouldn't go to me, even when... when I had hopes... I'll steal you, l'll take you abroad. No, Fyodor lvanovich, you won't do that. Perhaps, that's exactly why I love you. Go into the drawing-room. I'll come there shortly. I implore you, don't go there. She shouldn't have come here. Go. I didn't expect, dear cousin, that you have such a charming wife. I hope you won't get angry. I thought it my duty to pay my respects to this house. I have no intention of depriving you of the freedom to see your friends. On the contrary, l... as you please. No, I can't do it today. - No, I can't. - come on, it was so charming. - wasn't it, dear cousin? - Yes, charming. Go on. I heard, varvara Pavlovna, that you're a wonderful performer. Fyodor lvanovich, do you want me to play? Of course. If you feel like it... Allow me to introduce myself. Your maman was so kind to me. I hope you, too, will be my friend. So do l. - How is your health? - very well, thank you. we have just been enjoying a little music, waiting for you. - You're such a bear, Fedya. - why? Don't worry, l'll have you reconciled with your sweet wife. Not today, of course. come sit by me. Tiki-tiki-tiki, my sweetie. Just look at them. I hope today, God willing, they will have everything solved. She has tortured him enough. Maria Dmitrievna, are you going to the fair tomorrow? A fair? Fie! There're only drunken merchants there. No, you're wrong. A grand ball at the House of Nobility. - And a big buffet! - A buffet. A fair! How delightful! Marvelous! - Do you want to go to the ball, Lisa? - I don't know, Mother. Let's go there together. Maria Dmitrievna? vladimir Nikolayevich? Sergey Pavlovich? The theatre, horse rides. Are there going to be Gypsies? Don't you know? A new chorus... At vassily's. And all kinds of... - what's the matter? - Nothing. Steshka will again sing that romance about a willow tree. Elisaveta Mikhailovna sings that romance much better. which romance? That old romance? Yes, that old romance. will you sing for us, Elisaveta Mikhailovna? Yes, I will. I'll help you. willows by the road, willow trees are growing. Now they braid their tresses, Now they get them unwoven. To the wind they bow Their vines, o so thin... - More tea? - No, thank you. Serve a drink of water To a wayward pilgrim... - How is he, Your Excellency? - His front legs are too weak. come on, Petya, try him. At a gallop, at a gallop! what do you think? Don't let him trot! what a beast! He's just moving earth under him, Your Excellency. A real beast! And his croup is hot as a stove. You could sleep on it. And he is not winded! As for stumbling, there's no question of it. Fire! He is pure fire, Your Excellency. And staid like a Boyar. A horse with an ambition, God save him with a whip. No dog will ever dare bite him. Pure fire. Take him for 5 thousand. I'll give him to you for 4 and a half. A learned bird. Khlopakov! Khlopakov! - l'm here, Your Excellency. - what do you think? well, he's a real monster, Your Excellency. vladimir Nikolayevich! Fyodor lvanovich! So you're here too! - I am glad to see you. - So do l.... very glad. Elisaveta Mikhailovna has not yet accepted my proposal. I believe... I think she is doing it on the spur of the moment. Maria Dmitrievna thinks so, too. I have no intention of retreating. I believe, Fyodor lvanovich, I am sure that I won't find in either capital such a highly moral and intelligent, such a pure girl as Elisaveta Mikhailovna. And what do you actually want from me? I? I'm seeking from you, as an experienced man... the approval of my actions. Elisaveta Mikhailovna... She is certainly an extraordinary girl in every respect. She can make happy... any man. Really? Thank you. That's exactly what I expected of you. But not every man... can make happy Elisaveta Mikhailovna. Do you mean to say that I am unworthy of Elisaveta Mikhailovna? Precisely. Unworthy. You've got a French face. Mr. Kazarnovsky, come here. Yes, Your Excellency. And how much is this one? Only for Your Excellency, five thousand. - Three. - I can't, Your Excellency. He said three. I'll give you five thousand. Fyodor lvanovich, why are you here? You planned to go home yesterday. I'm giving five thousand. Then l'm giving six. Seven thousand. Seven and a half. Ten. Bring me some vodka. I understand you, Fyodor lvanovich. Your wife needs a carriage with horses no worse than in Paris. It's not nice, count. I remember you as a boy. I used to bring candies to you. And you ate them. Play! And I don't understand Fyodor lvanovich. Fyodor lvanovich, for how long do you think you can continue to shock society with impunity? Do you wish to challenge me to a duel? Nothing will come of it. Those duels... I don't recognize them. I am a half-mouzhik. My mother was a house serf. So I prefer to use a shaft. Send the horse to Lavriki. He's not even worth three thousand, sir. Of course, he isn't. Dear sir, Fyodor lvanovich, I can't sleep, thinking all the time where you could have been a whole week. - what time is it? - Almost seven. Shall I make your bed? - Bring me some soup. - Yes, sir. Thank you, Anton. You can go. I've been waiting for you in order to thank you. I know I don't deserve your forgiveness. I forgave you long ago. I think that you rejoiced when you heard the news of my death, but... Admit it that your life with me was very comfortable. That I always respected your independence. Your peace. That you were even happy. Now I am repulsive to you. But to stay here and become a provincial society lioness - this is beyond me. You know, I feel like a guest here. I'm going back to Paris. we have become strangers. And for parting I want to tell you, Fedya, that since youth you've been living in a world you yourself invented. All your life you have taken me for another woman, the product of your fantasy. You're even fantasizing your Russia. It is not like that at all. You will not be happy in Russia. what could I say to her? How could I object? It didn't matter to me whether I had invented my Russia or it was really like that. That's how I saw it, felt it, and loved it. I was convinced that so far... Only eternity related to it. could I relate to it? At that time I still didn't know that. The End
