All right, I'm throwing you in. No, you're not. Let me go see if they're ready to eat. My God, this looks amazing. Yeah? Good. It's almost ready. Burgers are the best. Everything all right? - Yeah, yeah. - Just coming down with something. You've been working too hard. You should go to bed early tonight. No argument here. Your children are standing right here. And I'm starving. Good, good, because we got hamburgers. And for the little lady, portobellos. Thanks, Dad. - You all right, Dad? - Yeah, yeah. I'm probably just tired. Something that I... I don't know. - Well, go sit down. - I can handle this. No, I got it. I got it, honey. Go sit. All right. Can you grab the platter? You... you too tired for a little catch, Dad? Maybe after dinner, buddy. All right. We don't have to. I know you're not as young and spry as you used to be. - Give me the ball. - Just give me that ball. Guys, it's time to eat. That's all right, hold on. Let me just teach this kid some manners. I'm sorry, was that it? All right, okay, good throw. You got that from your old man, you know. We'll see what you got, old man. Better go deep. Dad? Kyle! Kyle. We're right here. You're okay. - Dad, what's wrong? - Go get my phone. - Call 911. - What's happening? I don't know. Hurry up! Look who's finally awake. We're almost there. This is so cute, Mom. Glad you like it. It's beautiful, Mom. - You did good. - Thanks, honey. Wait till you see inside. Hey, hey, this is going to be good for us. A fresh start. We'll make new memories here. I like the old memories. What are you doing with that? - What do you mean? - It's Dad's rifle. Grandpa gave it to him, and now it's mine. I don't care. It's dangerous. You shouldn't have brought it, and I don't want it in the house. Fine. Jay. I know this hasn't been easy on him. Yeah, well, it hasn't been easy for me either, Mom. I know. Maybe this was a mistake. No. I'm sorry. Let's get these bags inside so we can make room for the moving van. Hey. Rough day? Sorry. Sorry, man, I didn't see you. - That's all right. - No harm done. You play? No. Not since... Well, not since my old school. Cool. So you just moved in. Yeah. Yeah, we just got here. - Chad. - Jason. Nice to meet you. You going to Purity Falls High? Yeah. That I am. Not exactly by choice. I'm sorry. Purity Falls isn't so bad. I'm definitely looking forward to getting out of here and moving to college next week. - You're lucky. - I'm a senior, so... Okay. I'm just hoping I can last the year, and then I'm out of here too. Chad, can you come inside and help me with something? Duty calls. See you around, Jason. - Yeah, I'm sure you will. - I mean, we're neighbors. No, I don't live here. Okay, great. Last three boxes. Thank you so much. Hey, Mom, can we order a pizza or something? Yeah. That sounds like a great idea. You're ordering pizza? Yeah. Go tell Justine what kind you want. Get me one with pineapple. Ew. Jay, you didn't talk to me the entire drive here. I know you're still disappointed that you can't graduate with Shane and Zack this year. It's not about graduating. I mean, that was our home. I mean... we'd been there since Justine was born. And you made us leave. You know I had to go back to work. We're burning through savings, and this is a good place for our family. I already hate it here. I'm 18. Like, I should have just stayed with Zack and his family. And I could have finished school and gone off to college. Jason. Hi, there. I'm Courtney McQueen. I'm your neighbor. I just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood. Hi. I'm Nicole Johnson. It's lovely to meet you, Nicole. Well, these are for you. Just something I whipped up. I know how exhausting moving can be, and the last thing you want to do is cook dinner, right? - Thank you. - That is so sweet of you. Let me take those. Come on in. - Thank you. - Kitchen's right over there. Please excuse the mess. Not to worry. Everything looks good to me. This is my daughter, Justine. - Hi, Justine. - It's lovely to meet you. Aren't you just the prettiest thing. Thank you. Look, now we don't have to order pizza. Cool. I'll grab us some plates. Courtney, this smells delicious. We love Italian food. Thank you. You know what? I should have brought you guys some wine too. Now you're talking my mom's language. Justine! Sounds like a party. Courtney, this is my son, Jason. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Jason. Do you have any kids? No. My late husband and I, we tried, but it just didn't happen. I'm so sorry. We... we moved here for my new job. Mom's going to be the new guidance counselor at Purity Falls High. Hey, congratulations. I know that they were looking a long time for the right person. Do you work for the school? No, I... I do try and stay involved in the community, though. I actually run a few home-based businesses. I sell a line of organic cosmetics to all the ladies in the cul-de-sac, so you guys will have to come to my next Green Lady party. And I also have a landscaping business. Well, if you're hiring, Jason used to mow the lawn at our old house. I don't need help finding a job, Mom. No, but that's terrific. I'm always looking for boys with experience. I... I don't know. Sure. Maybe. I think it's a great idea, honey. And you can finally start saving up for that car. A car. Well, listen, no pressure. I mean, the pay's not bad and the job has its perks. Well, listen, I'll let you guys get back to your unpacking. Don't wash the trays. I'll come and get them another time. Let me show you out. She seems nice. Nicole, you're going to love Purity Falls. It's very family friendly. And I know everyone. I'll introduce you. Honey, what's wrong? I didn't... I didn't want to upset the kids, but... I lost my husband last year. Poor thing. I'm so sorry. Is it just the three of you then? Yes. When you mentioned your husband, I just... I thought you should know. It tears you up, doesn't it? You must be so overwhelmed. You know what you need? You need a good friend. That's me. That's me. Yeah. Yeah, I got enough for the deposit. Well, it's enough for that apartment that you like. I know. Yeah, we're going to be so close to campus we can walk. Hey, Amber, hey, what did I tell you, all right? Don't worry, I'm taking care of us. I just want you to be happy. I got to go. Love you. Mom? Dad? What the hell? Hey. Who's out here? - Guys, hurry up. - We need to leave soon. We join Gary Bowers with the details. A Purity Falls High graduate has died in what appears to be an accidental drowning. The body of 18-year-old Chad Griffith was found in his backyard pool this morning. Purity Falls police are withholding further comment until an autopsy has been performed. His poor family must be devastated. We'll need to set up grief counseling at school this week. Where did I leave my bag? I think it's upstairs, Mom. What's wrong? I just talked to that guy yesterday. Are you serious? Yeah, he was working in the neighbor's backyard. Well, what did you talk about? Nothing. School. Creepy. Feeling anxious? - A little. - Don't be. You're going to make new friends in no time. Yeah, because everybody wants to be friends with the guidance counselor's kids. My God, I didn't even think of that. - Just relax. - You're going to do fine. Okay. See you later. I meant to tell you that football tryouts are this Wednesday. I don't think I'm going to try out. I'm just not really interested. Maybe try out for something else, then. The school has a lot of sports. There's soccer, lacrosse. Mom, don't worry about it. Have a great day, honey. Thinking about trying out? No. Not really. Yeah, our football team sucks. Our wrestling team is top in the state, though, so... - Yeah. - Yeah. I used to wrestle a bit in my old school. - Really? - Yeah. I'm Daniel. - Jason. - Nice to meet you, man. That is Clara. And she's been to every match. So how about it? We start practice this afternoon. I'll introduce you to the coach. Definitely... definitely look like you're built for it, man. Sure, yeah, why not? What can I say, man? The Purity Falls ladies are in love with us. You guys. - All right, let's go, Daniel. - Wrestle off. King, you keep time. Ready? Hey, what happened, man? I thought you were the best in the state. I said our team was the best in the state. Right. Let's see what you got. Caleb's a monster, though. No one can beat him. I'll tell you, after watching you, I'm suddenly feeling a lot more confident. Good, because I know someone who will be disappointed if you lose. Who? You want to get pizza and wings this weekend? Yeah, sure. I'll need a ride, though. Man, you need to get a car. Yeah, I need to get money first. Do you... do you know Courtney McQueen? My neighbor? Yeah, I met her last night. She offered me a job. - You should take it. - I worked for her. It was great. Mowing lots and stuff? She'll take care of you, man. Trust me. Jason, Caleb, you're up. Ready? Dude, you just pinned Caleb Miller! Are you kidding me? All right, that's it for today, hit the showers. It's nice to finally watch someone that knows how to wrestle. Why you got to be put me down in front of my new friend here? Hey. I'm Clara. Jason. Sorry, I'm sweaty. Speaking of which, we got to hit the showers. Yeah, I'll be there in a second. So a few of us... were thinking about getting pizza and wings this weekend. Would you want to join us? I was going to hang out at Abby's house. - Bring her. - Yeah, it's my treat. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. We'll meet you guys there. Okay. Cool. Okay. I know what you've been doing. - Take it easy. - Stay away from her. Don't even think about coming back. Because I'll kill you. What are you looking at? You okay? Yeah. Who was that guy? I don't know. Probably just some crazy old drunk. You don't know him? Never seen him before in my life. Well, hello there. It's Jason, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. What can I do for you, Jason? I remember you saying that you had a landscaping service, and that you might be interested in hiring me to work for you. My friend Daniel says that he works for you. Yes, Daniel's one of my best employees. Come on in. Do you mind taking off your sandals? - Sure. - Thanks. So can I get you something to drink? No. I'm fine. Please sit. So, do you have any landscaping experience? Well... I helped my dad take care of our lawn. I mean, I know what needs to be done. I bet you do. Are you sure that I can't get you some wine? I won't tell your mom. Sure. Why not? So... so... so Jack's turning the tiller the wrong way around. And the instructor yells out, "Hey, you might want to watch out for that buoy." You know, and as soon as he says that, bam. He just runs right into it. And you know that those things are made out of metal, right? Yeah. Did it mess up the boat? Yes. Completely. I mean, there was a whole scratch straight down the middle of it. So the instructor then says, "I think we'll just pretend that's the way we found it." And Jack, I mean, he just never lived that down. That sounds so fun. I mean, I would love to learn how to sail. Yeah, you need a lot of upper body strength for it. But I could tell that you'd be really good at it. Thanks. Do you want some more wine? Yeah, sure. That's going to stain. I am so sorry. Well, can you help... help me...? Yeah. Thanks. You're my hero. No problem. Do you know that ever since I saw you, I couldn't take my eyes off you? Really? I... I felt the same way. You're beautiful. So, you like older women, then? I... I wasn't expecting that. Yeah. I believe in... taking advantage of an opportunity when it arises. So, how are you liking it here at Purity Falls? Well... I'm certainly liking it a lot better now. Yeah? You didn't like it before? It's all right, I guess. It still feels kind of weird not having my dad around. You really miss him, don't you? You still got your mom. Your sister. Yeah. I guess. Your first client. You still want the job, right? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah, because she's expecting you on Saturday. What's this? It's an advance. I can't... I can't take this. - Of course you can. - I know where you live. Hey, you mind if I take a quick shower before I get out of here? If you give me a kiss first. There's some fresh towels on the shelf as soon as you walk in. Do you want to join me? I'd love to. "Use the accompanying diagram to solve exercises 5 and 6." "So given J equals K, P.J. equals P.K." This is not the geometry that I remember. This is impossible. We'll get it. I think I just need a little break. It's due tomorrow. Guys, I remember how to do this. Really? Yeah. It's not that surprising. I mean, I only did it a couple of years ago. I got to get dinner started. Hey, Mom, why don't we order in tonight? It's on me. Can we order Chinese? Sure. Go grab a menu. Someone's feeling a little generous. I decided to go see Courtney about getting a job. Really? Yeah, so going to be doing some landscaping work around town, and Courtney gave me an advance. Well, that was nice of her. I heard she's very successful. You could learn a lot from her. Yeah. And, you know, I want to start helping out around here a little bit more. I am, after all, the man of the house. Yes, I guess you are now. Well, just don't grow up on me too fast. I'm still your mother, and I'm here for you when you need me. I know. Thank you. Hello there. Hi. Sorry, I... I didn't mean to disturb you. Don't be silly. Just enjoying the view. You're new, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah, I just started working for Courtney yesterday. Well, she sure knows how to pick them. Can I get you a drink? Beer? Wine? Cocktail? No. I haven't even started yet. I'm fine. Okay, we can have a drink after. There's no rush. My husband's out of town, as usual. Okay. It's awfully hot out here. Why don't we go inside? Did I scare you? Is this your first time doing this? Doing what? Don't worry. I'll take care of you. Sorry... I... I need to leave. I understand, Karen. It won't happen again. Courtney! Can I call you back, Karen? Thank you so much. I'm in here! Something really weird happened. I just spoke to Karen, who said that you ran out without finishing the job. Yeah. I mean, she... she came on to me. Like, she... she tried to have sex with me. I thought that Daniel explained to you what the job was all about. What? Did you really think that I was sending you to trim hedges? My clients aren't looking for "yard work." Their husbands can help them with that. They're looking for something that the husbands can't give them, - like what you gave to me. - Are you kidding me? Look in that drawer and get the binder. Have a look through it. The women who come to me aren't looking to buy cosmetics out of a catalogue. They're looking to buy fantasies. That's what I give them. And I would think that that would be something that would interest you more than mowing lawns. No. No way. I'm out. - Are you sure? - Yeah, absolutely. That's... that's not for me. I'm sorry. Okay. Fair enough. But if you'll excuse me, I do need to find somebody else for Karen. I like to keep my clients happy. No hard feelings then? Of course not, sweetie. Goodbye, Jason. Goodbye. Yo, hold up. - Hey. - Hey, man. Dude, what happened? Nothing. That guy come back? - No, just forget about it. - I got to get to class. Why didn't you tell me about Courtney? Tell you what? You know. You went to see her. Yeah, and she sent me to some woman's house. - What happened? - Nothing happened. She tried to come on to me and I bolted. You... dude, you shouldn't have done that. I'm pretty sure having sex for money is illegal. What was I supposed to do? What, you actually enjoy doing it? Sometimes. I mean, yeah. It's great if you don't overthink it. I get to hook up with beautiful women and make some money. I mean, how many guys in here would kill to trade places with me? You just... you just got to be careful. But if it's not for you, man, it's not for you. It's better to figure that out now. Later. Yes? Hi, I'm Amber Weston. You wanted to see me. Hi, Amber. I'm Nicole Johnson. Nice to meet you. Please, come in and have a seat. I've been talking to sdents this week that were friends with Chad Griffith. He was your boyfriend, wasn't he? Yes, he was. I'm so sorry, sweetie. Chad's parents won't tell me anything. What do you mean? About what the police were saying. If there are any suspects or anything. Suspects? I thought he slipped and hit his head. Well, that's what people are saying, but... the police asked me if I knew anyone that... that wanted to hurt Chad. Hurt Chad? I knew something was going to happen. What do you mean? It doesn't matter now. Was he doing something illegal? You can tell me. He told me he was going to stop once he made enough money. He said he was going to stop. Amber, you need to tell me what Chad was doing. He was... He was sleeping with older women... for money. Have you talked to the police about this? Yeah, but... I don't want to get any of his friends in trouble. Other boys were doing this too? We were going to go get out of town. Start over somewhere new. I was... I got to get back to class now, so... Amber. I'll talk to the police and see what I can find out. Thank you. Hey, Mom? Hello, Jason. Courtney. What are you doing here? Hey. Courtney invited me over for drinks tonight. Justine is spending the night at Heather's. So if you want to order a pizza or something, go ahead. Actually, I was thinking about going to Daniel's. Can I borrow the car? Sure, honey. You know, my husband's old car is still in the garage. I thought I'd keep it just in case I needed a spare one day, but why don't I give it to Jason. Really? Courtney, that's too much. Well, look, it's no big deal, really. It's just taking up space. I mean, you'd be doing me a favor. It does need a tune-up, though, and the tires need to be changed soon. Well, now that Jason has his new job, he can take care of all those grown-up problems. Jay, what do you think? Sure. That's great. Thank you, Miss McQueen. Don't mention it. You can pick up the keys tomorrow. - Good night. - You too. Are you expecting something in return? No strings attached. I needed this so much. I hear you. How's the new job going? I'm relieved to say that I'm loving it. Well, that's great, right? You didn't think you would? I haven't worked full-time since Jason was born. After we lost Kyle, things got tight. I had some insurance money in savings, but that's for the kids' college. I was really worried about going back to work. But now, I feel more confident in having a career again. That's because you're a survivor. Like me. And I think that deserves a toast. To sisters, doing it for themselves. Cheers. Speaking of, I hear you're getting an award. That's nothing. The Entrepreneurial Spirit Award? Sounds like something to me. Well, Mayor Wiley is presenting the award to me this weekend, and I'm having a party here. You have to promise that you're going to come. I wouldn't miss it. You're a real community role model. - Stop. - No, really. You're a successful businesswoman giving back to the community. And you have amazing taste in jewelry. Well, one has to have their priorities. Cheers to that. - Hi. - Hi. Come on in. I've got the car keys in the kitchen. Look, Courtney, I really appreciate this, but you know I can't afford it right now. Well, I'm sure your mom can help out with the insurance and the repairs. Look, don't tell her I said anything, but we've... we've really had to watch our spending lately. Well, that's not my business. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have suggested it. Just, things have... things have been tough since Dad died, and Mom's doing her best, but she's... I mean, she's not you. Jason, I owe you an apology. I should have told you more about this job. You were not prepared, and that was really unfair of me. You know, I used to be like your mom. What my mistake was is that I relied on my husband for everything. It couldn't have been easy when he passed away. It's been a struggle. I mean, I loved Jack to bits, but he was a dreamer and, you know, he had grand ideas, but they weren't necessarily that practical. Before he died, he ran up a lot of debt that I didn't know about, and so by the time we paid for his funeral, there was no more money left in our savings. And the bank were ready to take away our house. That's... I'm sorry, that's terrible. I'm not proud of it. If I didn't have this extra income, I'd probably be out in the street. Well, look, seeing as I have a car to take care of now... maybe you and I can help each other. Not if you're not comfortable. I don't want my boys doing anything they feel bad about. But Daniel says he really likes it, and... Daniel's very popular with my clients. I just... I know the money would take some stress off Mom, and I... I want to help support my family. Are you sure? Yeah. Yes. I'm sure. Jason, thank you so much. That means so much to me. I'm very discreet, and so are my clients. Good, because I don't want Mom or Justine knowing about this. About what? You're just doing a landscaping job. When you're ready, she's looking for somebody special, and I think that you're exactly what she needs. All right. Thank you, Courtney. Don't forget your new used car. Jason. You should be really proud of what you're doing for your family. Hello? Miss Harris? Hello, Jason. The door was open. Stop right there. I want to get a look at you. Take off your shoes. Now your shirt. Excellent. Take off your pants. Sit down. Now it's your turn. At do you mean? Courtney was right You are adorable. Tell me what to do. T-Take off your shirt. Now take your pants. Now... tell me what you like. What turns you on? I don't know. You don't have to be afraid of pleasure, Jason. Miss Harris. Your share. Thank you. You should buy your mom something nice with that, like a... necklace or something. Your next client. Great. Honey. You didn't have to do this. Happy birthday, Mom. You deserve it. It's from the both of us. Thank you. I love you both. - All right, get that ankle. - Get that ankle. Time. Jason, you and Billy rotate them in. Okay, let's go, 20 seconds to get an ankle, then we switch it up. Ready? Time. Switch. Courtney been riding you too hard? Yeah, something like that. I've had a client every night this week. I'm definitely going to need a break soon. - Don't count on it. - You're fresh meat. At least the money's not bad, right? Yeah. I mean, you can't complain about that. I can finally afford to ask Clara out. Pizza boy? Some of the women, they... they like role playing. I was a pool boy last week. You seem distracted, man. What's wrong? I failed my biology test. I didn't have any time to study this weekend. My mom is going to kill me. I can help you study. Yeah? You good at biology? Yeah. I got lots of practice. I'll catch you later, all right? Hey, Clara. I was thinking that maybe you and me could go see a movie this weekend or something. I'm not going with you. Wait, why? I know what you and Daniel are doing. You're disgusting, Jason. Just stay away from me. Clara, wait. You ran away the other day. Kind of hurt my feelings. I am so sorry about that. I promise I am all yours now. Well, isn't that lovely. Yes. What's that? I didn't hear anything. Karen! My God! God, that's my husband. He's home early. What should I do? - Get in the closet. - Karen, where are you? Get in the closet. Why didn't you answer me? Well, I didn't hear you. So, whose car is that parked out in the street? Well, I have no idea. Karen... what do you do while I'm out of town? - What? - Never mind. I don't want to argue with you anymore. I cook, I clean, pick up your dry cleaning. And I think about you. I miss you. You know I love you. Where have you been? I was out with Daniel. - Do you know what time it is? - Yeah. Sorry. If you're going to be out this late, I'd appreciate a phone call. All right. I saw Mrs. O'Neill at school today. She told me you failed your test on Friday. Yeah. It's not a big deal. I can bring it up. This isn't like you. - I'm sorry, okay? - It was a hard exam. What do you want me to do? I've been your mother for 18 years, and I know when you're hiding something from me. Okay. What are you talking about? I thought things were getting better. I can only help if you tell me what's going on. Mom... everything's fine. Okay, I'm... I'm sorry about the exam. I'm sorry for... being out late. I'm sorry for not calling. - Honey... - I'm sorry for everything. I didn't get paid for last night. - I just spoke to Karen. - She told me what happened. Are you okay? Yeah, her husband is crazy. I saw a gun in his dresser drawer. How long has she been doing this? Karen is a very lucrative client, okay? That marriage has been over for years. Her husband's leaving on Tuesday. She wants you to come back then. Just get the money up front this time. No. Thank you. - Excuse me? - I said no. Look, I'm taking a break. I don't need this kind of stress in my life right now. Jason, we have an arrangement. No, we don't have an arrangement. I said I would help you out, and I have been. - But I'm taking a step back. - I don't think you realize how good you've got it with me. Most people would be taking advantage of you. Feels like right now the only person trying to take advantage of me is you. I can't believe you just said that. - Look, I'm sorry... - Take your next client, and we can forget about this conversation. That is all you care about, is your clients. - I'm done. - Jason! Jason! Hey. You okay? You should have warned me about Karen's husband. Yeah. That guy's a jerk. Yeah, a jerk with a gun. I'm through, man. I told Courtney that I'm done. How'd she take that? That's not my problem. Look, maybe a short break is okay. You can't let this take up your whole life. I mean, just recharge your batteries. Get back into it when you're ready. No, man. I'm... I'm done for good. Just... just be careful, all right, man? All right. Hello? Daniel? Hey, man, you shut the lights off? Old wires. This part of the building's old. The power used to go out all the time when I went here. Who are you? I'm Benjamin. A friend of Courtney's. I don't know any Courtney. Yeah, I'm sure some people go for the dumb, pretty boy routine, but I don't. Your next client, she wants you to go tonight. I told her that I'm out. Yeah. The thing is... that's not really up to you. I bet the ladies just love you. Bet you bring in all kinds of cash. Maybe you're tired of giving it all to Courtney. Maybe you want to keep more for yourself, is that it? - No. - Maybe I don't believe you. Fine. I'll do it. What will you do? I'll keep working for Courtney. Maybe you're smarter than you look. Don't think about backing out again. I'd hate to have to pay your little sister a visit. Nicole, thanks for coming. Of course. I wouldn't miss it. Come on in. This is for you. Congratulations. You didn't have to get me anything. I wanted to. You deserve it. - Stop. - I mean, really, how many women have won that award? Well, not enough as far as I'm concerned. Nicole, have you met Mayor Wiley? I haven't. - Pleasure, Nicole. - Please call me Sam. We are all so very proud of Courtney, and what she's accomplished here in Purity Falls. You're going to make me blush. I told you you were thriving. Refill, anyone? Yes, thank you, young man. I believe I will have another. Sure thing. - Well, hi, Daniel. - Hi, Miss Johnson. Thank you. You must have every boy in the neighborhood working for you. It was a pleasure meeting you. Can I let you in on a little secret? Sure. Well... landscaping isn't the only service that the boys provide. Yeah. Well, they bring me a lot of happiness too. So I like to think of them as my own children, since I can't have any of my own. - Courtney, congratulations. - Tiffany! I'm so glad you could come. Nicole, this is Judge Harris. Please, it's just Tiffany here. It's nice to meet you. I think my son Jason works for you. - He does? - Yes, he does. He's your landscaper. And you're so busy that you probably never get a chance to see him. That's right. I'm very satisfied with his work. That doesn't sound very good. Excuse me, ladies. I'm sorry. I'll fix it. That's all right, sweetheart. No harm done. Why don't we go outside. I want to have a little chat with you for a minute. Okay. Okay I'm... I'm... I'm fine, I'm fine. What are we doing out here? I thought... I thought you could use some fresh air. No, I hate fresh air. Let's go back in. I need another drink. No, you've had enough to drink, Karen. Am I embarrassing you? Am I ruining your little party? Good. You deserve it after what you did to me. And what have I done to you? Your boy, Jason, was in such a hurry the other night that he forgot his belt. Bill found it the next morning. I tried to convince him that I bought it for him as a present, but he... he got very angry. So now he wants a divorce. Well, maybe you should give him one. Really? I signed a prenup. Then I'll be left with nothing. He's away again on one of his "business trips." Said he expects me to be out of the house before he gets back. So, what are you going to do? Well, I don't know. It's all his. The accounts, the house. It's all in his name. I'm going to need money. I need money. Well, I can lend you a bit of money, Karen, but I'm sure that you have other friends that have money too. No. You're going to do more than "loan me a little money." You're going to give me money. After all, this is all your fault. It's my fault, is it? Yes. Putting ideas in my head, sending your boys over to tantalize me, to prey on me. Karen, you're drunk, sweetheart. I think you should go home, lie down for a little bit and sober up so that you don't say something you might regret. Well, I might be drunk, but you're loaded, Courtney. I want $100,000. Are you out of your mind? I want $100,000, or I will tell everybody about your little business, Miss Entrepreneur. I know you think you run the town. You've got your thumb on the pulse. Just wait till they hear this little story. I've got a title for it. "Cul-de-Sac Madame." So you're willing to ruin yourself as well, are you? I'm already ruined. I've got nothing to lose. Karen, I want you to leave. Now. Okay. I'll leave. I want $100,000, and I expect that cash tonight, or I'm calling... Watch your step, Karen. Watch your back. Everything okay? Yeah. Karen and her husband are getting divorced. That's too bad. Yeah, she seems really stressed. Speaking of which, are you okay? Yeah, it's just... Jason's been acting strange lately. And this investigation at school... What investigation? Do you remember that boy who drowned a while back? Yes. I-I think I remember something about that. I spoke with his girlfriend, and she told me that he was involved in illegal activities. Really? And the police don't think his drowning was an accident. What? They think he may have been murdered. Isn't that awful? You just never know what's going on in people's lives. They can seem perfectly normal on the outside. But underneath... Excuse me. Can I steal Courtney away for a second? I just want to grab some pictures for the paper. - Of course. - Please excuse me, Nicole. Do you know where the restroom is? Thank you. I'm sorry, I was looking for the restroom. It's right down there. Thank you. Sorry, I got out as soon as I could. - No worries. - So, what's up? Did your mom say something? No, Mom's still over at the party. So, what's... what's the big emergency? Do you know a guy named Benjamin? Yeah. Yeah, I know Benjamin. Did he come by? Did he say something to you? Well, yeah, he... He was in the locker room last night after you left. He gave me my next client, and then he freaked out on me. Dude. That kid is a psychopath. You need to stay away from him. I think even Courtney is scared of him. Why does she keep him around? He kind of got her started. He needed her contacts, and I guess she saw an opportunity. But he sort of stepped out on his own now. Try to get me to work for him instead. Is that who hit you the other day? I told him to go to hell. I'm not working for a lunatic like that. Dude, we need to go to the police then. How do you think they've got away with it all these years? I mean, Courtney's probably paying them off. - Is that your next client? - Yeah. Yeah, I should probably go. All right, well, I'll head back to the party, all right? All right. Meet me back here? Yeah. Hello. Wasn't expecting you. Hello, Karen. It's been a while. Yes, it has. Courtney asked me to give this to you. Didn't realize you still worked for her. Yeah, from time to time. I hear you're all alone tonight. Guess so. Would you like some company? Why not? You were always my favorite. It's been a while. What's this? Benjamin. Benjamin? What happened? She shot me. Karen shot me. Well, we got to call you an ambulance. No! Gunshot wounds get reported to the police. When they find Karen's body, they'll figure out what happened. - You're right. - So call your friends. You must have a client who's a doctor. Are you sure that Karen's dead? Of course I'm sure. I don't like mistakes. I don't make mistakes. - You sure about that? - What's that supposed to mean? When you went to see Jason at school, did you hurt him? What? No. No? I scared him a little bit, but I didn't hurt him. I just wanted you to talk to him. You wanted him back in line. I got him back in line. You punched Daniel after I sent you to go and talk to him. I'm not saying I'm not going to do it. I'm just saying... He was being difficult, and now he's not. Why are you bringing this up right now? - Please call someone. - I didn't want him hurt. I didn't want any of my boys hurt. Sometimes things get out of line. Accidents happen. Will you please call someone? Is that what happened with Chad? Was that an accident? What are you talking about? Did you kill him? You did kill him. What does it matter? He wasn't going to work for you anymore. You're out of control. And you're too soft. That's why you pay me. I clean up after your messes. I didn't want you to kill him! God, please... Can you please call someone? I can't believe this is happening. I should never have gotten involved with you. We watch out for each other. Courtney, please, who else can you trust? So you're not working on the side recruiting my boys? Stealing from me? Courtney, please. Please. Just help me, please. You're right, Benjamin. I have gotten soft. Please, Courtney. There we go. Where have you been? I just... I had something to do. What exactly do you do that takes you out of this house every night? Stuff. I don't know. I... I do stuff. I have a life. - Stop lying to me. - I'm not lying to you. - I answered your damn question. - Get back here. I have a big test tomorrow. Daniel's coming over to help me study. I don't want you to see him anymore. Why? He's a bad influence. No, he isn't. That doesn't even make any sense. I saw him do something inappropriate. Okay. What does that mean? It means you're not to hang around him. You can't tell me who I can and can't hang out with. I can as long as you live in this house. Well, then I won't live in this house. I never wanted to live in this house in the first place. I didn't want to come here. You know why we had to do that. Yeah, I know the real reason is because you couldn't stand being there anymore without Dad. This is our home now! This will never be our home without Dad! I could really use your help here, Dad. Chad. Hey, where were you last night? I stayed at the cabin. Have you seen Daniel? I thought Mom said he was a bad influence. Justine. I don't know. I think I saw him by his locker earlier. Hey. Does this have something to do with Courtney McQueen? It's a small town, Jason. People talk. Look, I... I got in over my head. But everything's going to be fine. You need to tell Mom. I can't. Well, I love you. Listen... promise me that you'll be careful, okay? Around school. Around town. And lock the doors when you're home. Why? Just promise me. Okay. Okay. I got to go. I love you too. - Hey. - Hey. You look rough. Was Chad working for Courtney? Yeah, for a while. But I heard Amber made him quit. Was there a chance that he was, you know, working on his own? Or for Benjamin? - No, way. - Dude, that's too dangerous. Dangerous enough to... get him killed? Yeah. Dude, I saw Chad's picture in Courtney's binder. Okay, we need to get that binder to the police. Dude, I told you, man, they won't listen. Yeah, but there's a big difference between prostitution and murder. Mom said that they've been asking questions about Chad. You don't think that's enough evidence to get Courtney arrested? Yeah. Maybe. I know she keeps a binder in her nightstand. I just need to figure out how to get it. Maybe... maybe I can get it. How? I'm going over there tonight to entertain a special client. Dude, that's perfect. Do you think you can pull it off? Yeah. Of course. Are you sure? It's pretty dangerous, man, if you get caught. No, it's... It's fine. I'll do it. - What? No, no, no. - Dude, I can do it. - It's okay, all right? - It's my plan. Make up an excuse for why you can't make it tonight. Tell her that I'm coming over instead. Tell her... tell her I want to make things up to her. Okay. I'll call her. Be careful, man. Jason, it's good to see you again. Hey, Courtney. I'm sorry about getting upset. No worries. I'm just... I'm glad I could help you out tonight. You're my adorable hero. Come on in. This is for the mayor. It's show time. - Evening. - Hello, Sam. Come on in. Hello, Thank you. Beautiful. Denise will be joining us a little later. She's having one of her charity dinners tonight - at the house. - Yes, of course. I don't believe we've met. This is Jason. He'll be your server this evening. It's very nice to meet you, sir. Well, you too, Jason. My wife will love you. Here's your drink, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. What time is Denise coming this evening? I'm not sure. But I see no reason to wait for her. - Whoops. - I'm so sorry. - It's quite all right. - Jason, you a little nervous? He's new. Excuse me. I do like new. You should get more new people. New constituents. Why don't I fix you a drink? You find Jason, and you two can get acquainted. I like that. I got tired of waiting. What are you doing with that? - Give me that. - Give it back. No! No! Hold it right there. Justine, I'm going over there. Mom, look. Police have reported two deaths in the town of Purity Falls. The bodies of 59-year-old Karen Reed and 21-year-old Benjamin Carr were discovered earlier today - by Reed's husband. - My God. Did you know her, Mom? She was at Courtney's party. They were arguing. This is outrageous! You need to calm down. He broke my damn nose! I can't be involved with this. Where the hell are you going? This is your mess, Courtney. You need to clean this up. Go to the garage. Now! Look. What are you going to do with me? Just shut up. Shut up. I need to think. None of this was supposed to happen. I didn't want anybody to get hurt. Yeah, then why all the threats? That was Benjamin, all right? He was out of hand. I've taken care of him. - What'd you do? - Don't ask questions that you're scared of hearing the answers to. Come on, honey. What's that? - Does she know you're here? - No. No, of course not. Please don't hurt her. Please. She doesn't know anything about this. Please! Please, she doesn't know anything about any of this! Shut up, all right? Please don't. Please... Shut up. Please. Please! Please! I never should have trusted you, Jason. - Jason is in danger. I know it. - Wait, Mom, I'll go with you. No, you stay here and lock the door. 911, what's your emergency? Hello? Mom! Mom. Courtney's got the key in her pocket. - Mom, she's got a gun. - It's okay. It's going to be okay. She's coming. She's coming. Well, let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. - Let's go. - Come on. I'm so sorry. I will always be your mother, and I will always love you, no matter what. Justine. Come here. I thought you said you weren't going to cry. I'm not. This was a great idea. I know. Should we join the party? Let's do it. Thank you guys for this. You taught me something. Really? What? I shouldn't be afraid of our old memories. I'm really excited to make new ones. Your dad would be so proud of you. Dad would be proud of all of us. I love you guys. Okay, enough mushy stuff. Let's have some cake.
