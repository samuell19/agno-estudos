Yes, tell me. - Don't leave the house. Why? Your stay in Kolkata... is probably over. Severe unrest all over Kolkata. Chaos in Moulali, Mallikbazar, Ripon Street, Beniapukur! Police forced to use tear gas, bullets as angry mobs set fire to the city. Fundamentalists fuel the rampage. Section 144 implemented. Enemy of religion! Leave Kolkata! Enemy of religion! Leave Kolkata! You don't want writers to think... or write... or live. Hasn't religion spoken of tolerance? This is no revolution! This is nonsense! This is mindless nonsense. I have nothing else to say about today’s incident. These are the words of fanatics. Political action, political reaction and political rhetoric... affect the psyche of the common man... BOU (wife) The common man does not have the political awareness to deal with it. The situation went out of control. Such news is flashed all over by the media and... This is very shameful for our city... and for us, Bengalis. Who are you to say whose visa should be cancelled?! India is home to Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Sikhs... India is not a religious state. So we should have been more careful. What we need to do now is to keep calm... Just one more question, Vikram! Can she really be forced to leave the city? I have no such information. Kolkata... the city of Literature and Art. Such an incident, here, involving a writer! Mob fury. And her reaction? In my opinion, she should not be disturbed now. And... excuse me! And I hope our media sympathizes with her situation. Definitely. Is your connection with her professional or personal? She's a friend. Excuse me. It is evident Ambarish, no one is divulging details. But still, friends like the esteemed entrepreneur, Vikram Ehsaas... bureaucrats have been visiting her all day. With Shyamal De on the camera, this is Ritwik, TV Kolkata. If an individual or a community disapproves of any written material, there may be protests. Isn't Baaghini a wild cat? Feeding on raw fish! Our democracy recognizes Freedom of Speech. You must understand what's going on! Just switch on the TV. Burning vehicles on the road isn't the right way. Come along. Come, eat. There you go. Good girl. My Baaghini knows clever tricks! Your water. I'm sorry. You'll have to come with us. Now. The car's ready. Cover her head.- - Okay sir. Cover her head. Be careful.- - Please cooperate. Back door.- - Please! Please cooperate. Don't worry, we've arranged for everything. Where am I going?- - Please calm down. Where the hell am I going?- - Come with us! Kindly, Madam, please!- - This is not done! Open that door!- - There's a spiral staircase! Careful.- - Please don't struggle. It's all so sudden... Let's go.- - You'll hurt yourself! It's dark. Just be careful. Vikram, come with me. Yes. Tell me.- - Do you have her passport? Flown to Rajasthan overnight. Immediately shifted to Delhi under tight security. Delhi wasn't safe either. Sources say she's been sent out of the country. To an unknown destination. My baby remains with you. Raw fish and full-cream milk. Just a few more days... I'll return. I surely will. Gustav is expecting me. All well? The area is secure. Theo... we are needed over here. Lucas Johansson, President of the Swedish Pen Club. Welcome to Sweden Ma'am. So... This is where you'll be staying for the time being. This cottage belongs to Mr. Jan Henrik, presently out of the city. We have arranged for 24x7 security here. So, please make yourself comfortable until Jan gets back. If you need anything... anything at all... just... give me a call at this number. All international calls have been barred. Please have a seat. So... this is your permit in Stockholm. We need you to sign at the last page, please. Sorry Madam, but... We do find it most unfortunate that your country disowns you. And that even India has sent you away so unceremoniously. See, I'm an author myself and I know how that would...- -I deserve it. Deserve it? It's the pen and the sword. The sword always wins. Newspaper Headlines: BANISHED IN EXCHANGE OF MINORITY VOTES RETURN TO INDIA UNCERTAIN What's up? Shayonti... What's wrong? Get that thing out of here! It was sitting on my chest! And keep this thing tied at night. Tied?- - Yes. You didn't ask for my consent. Now, deal with it. Or get a nanny for it. Disgusting! A nanny? My phone... Come with me. And listen, make sure she doesn't pee on my school books! Pritam here. Hello. Yes, hello... This is Amal Majumder, the photographer. We'd like to do a photoshoot. With me?- - No. The cat. At what time today would she be free? After twelve? Lucas...? Yes... Lucas... Coat. Thank you. Excuse me. Can you help me? I'm very hungry. Food... I need food. English no no- Swedish or Finnish. I'm hungry. I need to eat. Here? She's gone underneath again. Baaghini... She's very fidgety!- - Come out, honey.- Yes...- - Baaghini, come out. Sir, please request her... if she could kindly come and sit on the sofa. Face the camera.- - Uncle wants to take a snap, come out. Behave yourself. - Always in profile! Sir, do you have a chocolate that she might like? Me??- - You surely have milk to lure a cat with? Yes of course! Baaghini! Come, I'll give you some milk. Please get it. She'll come out as soon as you go. Very disobedient.- - Let's see if milk works. Always wriggling! Tough one, this! Here you go... Come out you &%$^%$! Mother! Mother! I am very scared! I am scared, Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Madam... Madam! I am sorry to wake you but- - It's okay. You are a superstar in Sweden! A letter from the Prime Minister. May I? Yes. Okay. Here it is. Madam, Welcome to Sweden. The Swedish people have always honoured the humanist in you. We assure you the maximum security in our country... and hope to offer you the peace needed for uninterrupted work. It would be my pleasure to meet you in person. My Personal Secretary will be in touch with you. May this Land of the Midnight Sun become your home. A real honour. A real honour, Madam. What more could one ask for? Food. Food? Anything that I can eat. So, Pritam... Your name's in the newspapers. You're getting calls from journalists... You're a celebrity, buddy! Oh please! She's your friend! And you never told us! Hey Pritam... where is she now? No idea. She didn't even call. What chaos!- - It's expected! You'll keep writing against my religion... Am I to sit on an easy chair sucking my thumb? Moti, don't get me talking! That's sheer fanaticism. Debu, there are fanatics in every religion. Let go! I agree! That's the root of all problems! Let's have some tea. If this was about Ram or Ramkrishna... they'd shove it up your- True.- - Operation Rescue. I've seen enough! Maqbool Fida Husain painted a nude of Goddess Saraswati. Could he come back to the country in his lifetime? Madam... Why did she leave the cat with you, of all people? We're acquainted. Did you speak to her after she was banished? We've never spoken. We hear that there are many men in her life... Do you support this as a woman? Sorry, I have a class. Mrs. Mukherjee... I didn't mean to offend. Please be patient. Just a few more questions. I won't comment on anyone's personal life. Fine, I won't insist. For the rating box in our daily... Her work... Her sex appeal... Her beauty, personality... How much would you rate her on ten? I respect her as a writer. So this means... When you get a copy of her new book... Who pounces on it? You or your husband? He reads the manuscript before it goes to the press. For ages now... it is men who have raped women. Don't you think... that the woman is raping men through her writing? You haven't read all her writings, I presume. If she were a man, would she have been in this plight? Come. What makes you smile?- - Nothing. Have your tea.- - Thanks. I agree with Moti. If you criticized my religion, I wouldn't accept it either. Then go on a rampage! Kill! Set fire to the entire nation in the name of religion! That'll be the end of all civilization! Debu... calm down and think. Its not just religion. Her autobiography? Have you read it? Shameless! Is this any way to emancipate women? Who wants to know about your private affairs? Why, you?!- - Me?? Which is why you read them. And retained only the 'private affairs'. Nonsense!- - Sad! Enough! Five books are banned. The writer is banished. What else could one want? Courage! To express an opinion and to accept it, with courage. Come on. Now come on, you must eat. Come. Here. I had to leave her behind, Mr. Johansson. The city refuses to have me. The country refused to grant me citizenship. Accepted. But I hope they are not unkind to my little baby. I am all she has. I'm her world. Start writing again, Madam. Publishers from this part of the world are eager to publish your books. And our Pen Club is receiving letters daily. Send the publishers to me.- - I've short-listed a few. And in my judgement the best choice would be William Nygaard from Norway. From Norway... You mean the man who published... Satanic Verses? Yes. And got shot by extremists. They killed the Japanese publisher. But William Nygaard, he survived. I'd like to meet him please.- - Hello! Wilma, my wife. Some things I think you need. How wonderful to meet you! I'm so glad! And you're wearing the jumper! Is it keeping you warm? Yes.- - Good, I got some more jumpers. I didn't need so many.- - And here, I got a brown one. Brown one's nice.- - So now you really should be warm. Thank you. So, its bought in a charity shop, which I thought you would like. And of course I have some... I really hope they fit you. We don't want you to freeze your feet. I don't know if you need them. Some underwear? Maybe not the right size?- - No, I think they should be fine. You can try them. Thought you might need some.- - Yes! Yes! And some knickers as well. Everything under control, Gustav? Yes! All good. Do we need anything else? English lessons for me and Theo. We'll see what we can do about that! The reporters are chasing me to school now! "Why did she keep the cat at your house?" "When a new book comes... who pounces on it? You or your husband?" Please listen... I had no answers, Pupu.- - Sorry. I feel so humiliated! Sorry!- - Do you have an answer? Told you, I'm sorry! Sorry! Please don't go, I love you! Please don't go my love! I need rest, Pupu. I'm going to my mother's. I've arranged for a maid! Why go to your mother's? You didn't engage a maid when I conceived! Now there's a governess for the girlfriend's cat!! But... You yourself asked me get a nanny! Oh right! You always do everything I say! See... You asked me not to bring her home, so I didn't. This is just her cat! This is not 'just her cat', Pritam!! It's that woman! She's all over this house! I don't want to have anything to do with her!! Please calm down. I don't want her name to be uttered ever again! You get it!!!- - Okay. You'll hurt yourself! I shouldn't have had this baby! So this one is for pizza?- - Yes, this is for pizza. Can I use this on... normal bread?- - You can use it on whatever you want. Bread or different... White pepper.- - And this one? I'll make some more coffee. We're sorry Madam but... The owner of this cottage is coming back... today... so... We have to vacate. Now. But... Wilma and I would love to have you stay with us. Absolutely! That would be wonderful! Please! It is not my daughter's fault. After all, she is four months pregnant. And... cats aren't good for pregnant women. Get rid of the cat atleast for this reason! One last word of advice. Prioritize. See... who's important - the cat... or your wife. And child! If you can't remove the cat... my daughter stays with me. Simple. Mary Anne Weaver?- - Yes. We'll bring her home if you insist, but... We could invite her to your Press Conference. Press Conference? Yes... From the Ministry of Culture. Press Conference Do's and Don'ts. It's to be held at Rusbud, the Government Annexe. 500 reporters from all over the world. A small gathering in a small space. Just for your security. I cannot lie, Lucas. The whole literary world knows that... my country wants my head. That I've been sent away from India. Why must I lie? If you ever wish to go back to Bangladesh or to India, then... I have nothing against Bangladesh or India. It's the extremists I'm against. Extremists the world over. Extremism is taking lives all over the world... And I have very rigid opinions on that. It's a bitter practicality that we plead you to accept for now. Then it's pointless having a Press Conference. Cancel it. We can’t keep the press away forever. But it's so unlike me, Lucas! Even my parents... have been forced to pretend that I don't exist... simply because I’ve always stood my ground. In order to speak... write what you feel, you need a home... you need a country where you can stay! Is this a threat? Don't get me wrong. Sweden indeed is your country. And you are a citizen here. But... You need to live! Even Galileo... had to lie to the Church. Just to save his discourse. You have a visitor, Madam. Mary Anne Weaver! Finally! I had almost given up hope. I travelled to Dhaka to meet- - I know! I know, you... You met my people. You... met my mother, my father! I know. I know! Please... Come! When I asked them where I could find you, they couldn't say. Your father... he... grabbed my hands... and cried. Your mother... she just had this blank stare. I felt so helpless! They're so very proud of you. They won't be. Not anymore. Because I must lie now. I must say that the Sun goes round our Earth... that the Moon has her own light, that the... harmony of the stars of the universe... the galaxies just don't exist! Just to be free! To live and tell my story. Please. I'm ready for your interview. I already have all your answers. Madam has locked the cat in the bathroom. Madam?- - Yes. What! Tea?- - No. Hey... I'll keep this, you carry on. Go! Are these your starters? Or have you got the cat hooked onto alchohol? No... - - I came for the medical file. I have a check up tomorrow. Shayonti... Please stay. Shall I make tea? The electricity bill is due for tomorrow. Thank you very much, Wilma! Now I can start writing again. Lucas told me you prefer typing. Yes. Thank you, both of you. Dhonyobaad. What was that? Dhonyobaad... It means, 'thank you'. Dhonyobaad...- -Yes. And to your new life in Sweden! They say cats have many lives. So do you! Let's sit. My Baaghini will be very... very cold this winter. My Baaghini. Wild cat! Someday... Someday, Wilma... I'll return. I'll return. And I'll take you with me. Yes! I'll play Bengali songs for you. And we'll sing together. And we'll...- - And we'll dance! Hey! I can't dance!- - Yes, you can! Really, no, I can't!- - Come here! Dance with me!- - I can't! Yes!- - I can't dance! I can't! Please. No! Dance with me!- - I can't! Be with me! Yes, you can dance with me! Come on! Okay I'll try! We'll dance and I'll step on your toes! And we'll... laugh like crazy! And we'll cry! And we'll talk and talk and talk! We'll scream until they hear! And we'll love the whole world! And we'll teach men... how to love! And how to live! And... How... not to have... sex! What 'not to have sex'! I want to have sex! Lots of sex! But... not with... Most of our women... have never ever experienced an orgasm! Can you believe what failures these men are? Never had an orgasm? Even you? I've had my share of good sex... with men I chose to accept. But... I am one of those species who can come out and say that. Most women can't. Sex is taboo. Women mustn't want pleasure. I'm shocked!- - They must only serve. Gratify male libido! Only serve. Not ask. But... that's so... that's so terrible! It is! From where I come Wilma... Women are not even allowed to think differently. We are all expected to grow... within a very rigid, very... orthodox... mould. And if we dare question it, question the system or... any system... this is what happens. Look at me! I'm nowhere. Extremists force your own people, your family, your friends to disown you. I've lost my citizenship. My people don't know where I am. Call them! Talk to them! I'm not allowed, Wilma. Nobody must know where I am. I... I only wish I could reach out to them just once. At least my parents. To let them know I'm still living... I'm... alive! Suppose... I did work out a way... Would you be careful? Nobody must find out. Sometimes there are extremist decisions even within a family. Which is why your wife has left for her father's. Now your situation is like that of the Government's. Either get rid of Baaghini... or lose your wife's support. I have a feeling Baaghini has not been cared for at all. Only bad news in my inbox. Anyway... I'm sending you my friend's office address. Arrange to send Baaghini over. At least I'll have someone to speak to in Bengali. Do not mention my name in the address. I'm mailing you an authorization letter. Where's the address?- - Right there. Oh right!- - What are you looking at? Oh. What do I do? Keep shut, he's coming. What else, send her. Send who? - Moti... - Can't you see I'm busy? Send who?- - Err... Baa... Baa...?- - Send Shayonti to Buddy's in-laws'! But Shayonti is already...- - Pregnant! She needs rest. So... Right! Yes, tell me. What are you saying?- - What else! Send it! To Sweden?? Operation Courier Service. Courier a cat?! Do not ring, O midnight phone. Here’s your pillow Your blanket wrap A pill for deep slumber Sleep the night away. The city now is only dead wood The sky too has turned off the stars to sleep. When you ring, chunks of ice run down my spine, stupefying me. Like the frail leaves in the Norwesters I shiver all over And the locust attacks my golden yield. I remain alone and forgotten In this distant land of snow. I hear that Father’s heart is failing him His eyes are weakened too. And friends making quick escapes To a shelter yet unknown. Do not ring, O midnight phone. No one lies awake for you at this hour Even the drunks of the night have gone to sleep. Please sleep the night away. Sweden. 18 kilograms. 32000. 18 kilograms! How come? But we carry her very easily. It includes the wooden box and the packaging. Exactly! And this 32000 includes courier charges... doctor's fees... medicines... Doctor? Umm... So the doctor will accompany her to Sweden? It's an 8 to 10 hour journey... If there's wailing and screaming all the way... The doctor's?- - Come on! Didn't I tell you she'll need sedation? Exactly.- - Give the letter. Her mother's authorization letter. It's HER cat?!- - Yes. Why?- - Sir... It's impossible to send the cat without a Police NOC. Why?- - Why the police? She's a VVIP cat. Just an NOC from the Police HQ! That's it! Crazy! I’m looking for a home in this city A room where I can sleep at night A home… where I can shed my clothes for a shower Sing to my heart’s content Or sip my self-brewed cup of tea And write beautiful poetry. I have no home of my own. Dagens Nyheter's Guest House... will be more secure. More private. You can write there. I write better among people. How far is Gouripur from Kolkata? How far is Shambhuganj Bridge from Sealdah Station? How far is Radhapukur? And the naked afternoons drooping over horizons of kaash? The Bhatiyali melodies that flow down the heart of the Brahmaputra? How far are they? Gouripur had homes Courtyards, fields for shepherds Stone-terraced river banks, sky-canopied bazaars And it had... Gouri. Is she there now? She and her rag dolls? Does she play now as she did, hopscotch, dust upto her knees? Sixteen men? With peas and turnips Does she still cook on her heart-warmed fire? Somebody said the other day that Gouri is gone Picked up by one or many, the moment she stepped out of her nest Stripped off saree, thrown into the canal at Baashkhali. Found with a hungry bite on her cheek. If Gouri is indeed gone If Gouri is gone indeed If sails are indeed windless To which unknown land would I swim, pushing against the tide... Flowing on and on... For my love? No brandy on duty. It’s going to be a long winter. Coffee? Make it double. Strong. It's so cold you can almost smell it. Yes... like Christmas. And you can smell the snow. Yes... I get it. She's unhappy. She's had no dinner. She'll survive. After all she's a doctor. Why do they want her head? She looks quite normal... ordinary. But she’s not ‘woman-woman’... doesn't dress up. She looks sort of angry. I feel sad for her. Why did you stop the song? Gustav is in the shower. Coffee, Madam? Are you crazy? The Commissioner of Police must issue an NOC for a cat? But if I have to send the cat to Sweden... It's your cat, send it to the moon if you like! Why involve the police here?- - Since she's a VIC, an NOC - VIC?- - Why? Very Important Cat! Here. I see. How are you related to her?- - She is staying in my house now. In your house?? In this city?! Right now she's outside, in her basket, with Jayanta. In a basket?- - Yes. I'm not talking about the cat. How are you related to the lady? A friend. Look, before I issue the NOC, I need to speak to the CM. You know how sensitive this issue is. Come back next week.- - Let's go. Oh no! Did you have to pee in the Police HQ? Baaghini is just like her mother. There's no stopping her. There were mild protests in the city after you left. Now there’s a stony silence. You are in cold storage now. Even a celebrity is forgotten within a few days of death. (LETTERS OF THE BENGALI ALPHABET) Not only am I ordinary... but I'm also alive. Only, I’ve nearly stopped writing. I seem to be forgetting my language. Once Baaghini comes, I'll get some practice. I'll return. And I'll write once more. For you Madam! Had called to ask you how you were. You didn’t answer. I'm fine. Good. You take care. Forgive me if you can. It's probably her birthday today. Have you wished her? I did. Just before I sent you my message. Thanks for being honest. My inbox is overflowing with birthday emails for you... from bureaucrats, journalists, publishers. But I have a special birthday surprise for you. Yes. Here we go! Let me read this. Dear Madam... We are honoured to present to you... this year’s Kurt Tucholsky Award... for your invaluable contribution to literature. An award worth 150,000 Swedish Crowns! Celebrations are not for me. I chose this life of loneliness. I can't complain. I took the other road, the road less travelled by. And that's what made all the difference. Robert Frost. Yes.- - Very inspiring. And Virginia Woolf! She's been a great inspiration. Yes. And Simone de Beauvoir. Yes she will live! Yes she will live! Yes she will live a hundred years!- Let the music play! Happy Birthday my dear! This is the best surprise today! Have some cake.- - I'd love to have some cake! Come. Lucas got this green... cake for me here. Princess Torte!! I love it! And champagne!- - Yes, champagne. Dhonyobaad.- - Yes. 'Thank you'. Oh my darling! I told Lucas not to tell you I was coming. Where's the music? Let's dance! You know I can't dance.- - Of course you can! This room is fantastic! Oh, I can play the piano for you! Well, I don't know what to play! This is a song all Swedes know. It's not a home, Wilma. My home, my love, how are you? Do you feel lonely? So do I. I'm as lonely. I walk about in empty rooms Can you see me in the dark? Can you hear me move? It's me, my soul, that moves about In empty rooms, leaving behind drops of tears. The plants in the verandah need water, but no one's there Can't they survive on tears? I hold a river in my eyes Tell me if you want a sea, I'll pour it to you My home, You must live. Are you merely my home? You are my lost homeland You are my mother-tongue My home... live, my love And keep me alive! They never stop to think before they write! And then it becomes our responsibility! She writes a book and releases it! That's it! Now deal with it! It's a VIC... so the courier service is insisting on an NOC! They've turned the cat into a tigress! So have we! Umm... We've been talking about this cat all day long! That's right! Do you know how many meetings I've had to cancel for the day? 'A hanky today, a cat tomorrow!' He's quoting Sukumar Ray...- - Shut up! I can't take this anymore! Don't I have any other work? If they want to send it, let them! Sir, I think we must have a word with those who are against her. I mean... we need a religious NOC. Right! Manibul, - - Sir! Take charge. Don't delay. After all, this is a religious matter. A cat's religion, this is my department, Sir. Department of Fisheries! My life of banishment led me to introspect. That's when I started telling the story of this girl. A meek, shy girl... Who grew up amidst rigorous family discipline and exploitation. A girl, whose dreams and hopes were trashed away everyday. I told the story of that ordinary girl. The girl who was wounded again and again. She lived alone, fought alone. She became her own shelter. Her environment, surroundings have helped her evolve. They've made her what she is. That's my story. Have I committed a crime? Is it a crime to write an autobiography? It's a relief that they have no objection! Should I issue the NOC, Sir?- - Yes, go ahead. One minute! There's still one major problem, Sir. What?- - What now? What is it now? What? What if you issue an NOC... and then the cat... STOP MEWING AND SPEAK ALOUD!! Say, you issue the NOC... and the cat... escapes in transit! ? ?? ??!! Or say it dies.- - Oh God! The entire blame will come tumbling down on us! They'll project it as an assassination or a religious murder! And blame on the police means blame on you! No! You represent the government! No way! No NOC! If the government is blamed then... Enough!! There starts another discussion! Sorry, Sir. Chanchal! The bottomline is, I will NOT issue the NOC! Sir, what if we... have a word with the embassy? Why the embassy?- - Embassy!! Good riddance! Send the cat through the Swedish Embassy! The CM is sending his man to Delhi. To recommend Baaghini at the embassy. Since I am her local guardian, I have to go as well. But yes... they're taking good care of her, you know. The Department of Fisheries sends fresh fish for Baaghini daily. Pabda! Parshey! Amazing taste! Why are you laughing? It's a fact! Come on, eat your fill, baby. Isn't my Baaghini a wild cat? Oh baby! Look at you! Wild cat! Let me clean your eyes! Good girl! Always the best! Sleep sweetheart. Sleep in peace. Sleep in peace, my baby... So once again you're cut off from the rest of the world. Lucas is very upset with me. I have... would you please check my mails for me? Send me print-outs of mails from Pritam Mukherjee. I'll just write that down for you. Pritam Mukherjee, through... Theo. Theo?- - Yes, when he goes to you for provisions. This is his e-mail ID. He's the one... who's going to send... Baaghini over to your office address. You really should have been more careful. I'm sorry! I'll do my best. The Chief Minister's recommendation looks good. We shall extend all possible cooperation. So, where is she?- - Sweden. The cat.- - The cat's in Kolkata. Name?- - Mr. Pritam Mukhopadhyay. The cat, Mr... Mulka-dha-padhay... the name of the cat! Oh... Baaghini! Yes.- - Bug-in... A cat named after a bug?- - No, actually not a 'bug', Sir. It's 'Baagh'. You see, in Bengali, 'Baagh' means tiger. So... 'Baaghini' is female for tiger. Tigress! You see, umm... 'Baagh-Baaghini', tiger-tigress... lion-lioness... Deer... err... dearest... and then... Yes, of course. How very amazing. That would be all. Our Honorary Consul in Kolkata will be dealing with you... directly. Thank you. Let's go... What is it, Manibul? But... what would be our next step, Sir? When are you going back to Kolkata? This evening itself, Sir. Otherwise Baaghini has to sleep with my maid. There he goes!- - But the maid leaves exactly at 9. She's very punctual. So... I have to go... and... to sleep with Baaghini. Of course, I understand. In that case you can start working on ...Buggini's passport. And the first step would be to get a... passport-sized photograph taken. Face straight. Eyes in the camera. Ears showing clearly. 4 copies. Come on, turn your head.- - Not your head Sir, the cat's. There she goes!- - Look how she's wriggling! Keep quiet! Look at the camera! Move your hand!- - It's covering her ears! How am I supposed to control her ears now! Oh God! Will you remove your hands? Gone! Look how she's biting! Be careful!- - Ouch! Look at the lens!- - Now I'll scold you! We also need photographs for her visa! On a white background!- - Is there a white loin-cloth at home? What is the real colour of the cat? Pure white? Off-white or pink? Completely pure white. 'Completely pure white'.- - We can tweak it in Photoshop. But a cat won't pose. You can't train cats. Sir! Madam's passport! The passport! Let's see! The passport is ready! Here... over here...- - Hold this. And here... the candidate has to sign here. Signature? Now you need a signature?- - But she's a cat. How on earth will a cat sign?- - Can everyone sign in our country? A thumb impression will do. A thumb-print?- - It's simple. Paw-prints! Here... here... I have marked all the forms. The candidate... will have to give her paw prints here. More?! On all these forms?- - It's a rule, Sir! What's wrong, Sir? Why don't you finish your sherbet? Don't be so nervous! Here, have some snacks. Every candidate has special requirements. Thank you.- - Mention not. Okay. Mr. Goenka... We'll take your leave. My pleasure, Mr. Gupta! Thank you, Sir.- - All the best! See you, sir.- - See you. Sir, I'll go see them off.- - Okay. Jayanta...- - Just a minute... excuse me! What's wrong?- Must've gone back for his sherbet. Which paw do we use for the thumb-print? The hind ones are her legs... And the forelegs, her arms! - Simple! Have a nice day! I'm weary Take care My beloved country May no one ever... be compelled to leave her motherland. You'd like cigarettes? You? When my Baaghini comes here... I'll marry her to you, Gustav. Always at your service, Madam. What do you think, Theo? I'll marry him to my Baaghini. Smile, Madam. Be happy. Why are you blushing? Baaghini will like you. Theo will be your Best Man. Won't you, Theo? I'm buying provisions. Do you need anything? Does everyone have a stamp-pad? Easy!- - Put her on the chair. Don't pull her legs!- - If she bites, you'll need injections! Is the first-aid box ready?- - Tickle her a little! Hey! Catch her! Here's your ball, honey!- - Did you give her this smiley ball? Please cooperate! She's run away again!- - Get hold of her! This compounder's a sissy!- - What did I do? My sweet little pie!- - Cooperate with the police! And she's gone again!- - Get hold of her, somebody! She'll drive us mad today! She's gone to the living room. Over there! Yes! Over there!- - No, I'll go first! Wait! She's gone behind the almirah.- - Oh no! Please cooperate! Come out! Lure her with this ball! She's run away!- - I'll see the end of this! Here you are, darling!! Baaghini sweatheart! Hey compounder, get hold of her!- - There she goes! Without sleeping pills... this is impossible. I'm sorry for the rush. I'll... explain everything later. This is Liliana, Pen Club member. We met at the... Press Conference. Where do I go?- Liliana's summer house. In... Ljusterö.- - Yes. It's an island. Island! On the Baltic. It's yet another banishment. Gustav? Theo? Gustav... Gustav will... be with you. Where are you lost? No mails... Are you upset? Or are you ill? We're going berserk trying to get Baaghini to cooperate. It's so evident that she's your daughter! Anyway... Jayanta is trying to sedate Baaghini now. Come on, get me the ball! And Baaghini... is running around with the new ball that Shayonti gave her... Come on honey! Don't be naughty now! Sweet kitty! Here I come! A small little paw-print from you! And Baaghini... is running around with a new ball. I wonder how he'll get her to sign! Just a few more days... and you can speak Bengali with Baaghini again. You'll write again. And return. I'm not very easy with cats, Sir. It's just that this verification is mandatory for the passport... Though, the passport is done. A mere formality now. Just one look at the candidate. From a distance. That's it! Excuse me... She doesn't bite, does she? She was sleeping. Made us run all night with stamp-pads... Amazing!! The cat and the tiger belong to...- - The same family. Family...- - Sir... the tiger's not matching at all! How come? She's plain in the photos but here she has blue spots...... That's the ink from the stamp pad. Imagine that today is the day after Holi (festival of colours). So the candidate has weird colours on her... No Sir!! Give her a shampoo... and bring her to the police station! Right to Equality! Right to Freedom of Religion! Right to Education! Right to Freedom!- - Who's going to write on the board? Ma'am!- - Yes, Rohan! Write this down boys.- - Give me a pen. Bring your own pen next time. Phone! Sorry... I think I forgot to put it on silent. Sorry boys, it must be an emergency. Hello!- - I'm in class! Any problem? Make it fast! Oh! Just one thing! Emergency! - - Emergency?! Emergency!- - What! Can you fix an appointment for Baaghini at your salon, please? She just collapsed during her shampoo! Come on! Move it! Hey move! Take left!- - Mind the door! I'll get the admission done. Start oxygen. What's her BP? The Commissioner is here. What happened?- - I took her to the salon, so... Salon?!- - Yes. Yes...- - The patient is stable, as of now. She'll improve once the she's out of stress. She'll be fine. Don't worry. Thank you. What a relief! Just a minute, doctor. She's supposed to leave for Europe tomorrow. Can she? Yes?- - No, not in the next few months. Sorry.- - What! Okay? Sir, what do we do now? See, now it's the responsiblity of the embassy. How is she? Still the same. Have you had anything to eat? I can't take this anymore Shayonti! Should I come? No. Let me be. NOTICE: 'Don't abandon cats in winter'. See the shadow, see them Movitz, my friend Escape into a darkness that never ends All the gold and the purple from the shovel Watch them turn into filthy clothes and gravel Waves Charon from the other side of the swirling river Waving three times and then the undertaker himself... Never again will you taste a grape So, Movitz, dear friend, help me... Cumber the tombstone over our sister Waves Charon from the other side of the turbulent river Hello Doctor!

Sir Lucas Johansson... Wilma! Madam!! Hello! And good morning to you! Hello! France has granted you honorary citizenship of Paris. You see, they all love you. How long do I live here? Till I die? Or... will I have to be imprisoned in Paris now? Or in Germany? I shall fight to death my right to go home! If I am a criminal... why don't they take me to court? Try me? Why imprison me here in this island? I can't live here! I can't... write, I can't talk! Only... These security men, guns, boots, bayonets! And I am a poet! My darling... Listen... The embassy... from India... sent you an e-mail. Your cat is in their care. She's been to hospital. So she can't be sent to you. I'm sorry. We have a surprise for you! Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?- - A real beauty! Hello kitty! I helped... deliver... a baby after a long time. Last night. And after a long long time... I... saw a mother... and... her daughter together. See, Baaghini is my daughter, I need to be with her! She knows my language... she's my... connection with home. Return her home. Let's not put this baby through the same hell... of... separation. Return her home to her mum. To mother. That's where she belongs. It's her birthright. Wait for me O Madhupur Netrokona The crossroads at Joydebpur, wait for me I shall be back. Back in the crowd, amidst the chaos In drought and flood. Wait for me O huts, courtyards, lemon boughs and football fields I shall be back. To sing in the full moon, to swing... To throw a fishing line into the pond in the heart of the bamboo grove. Wait for me, Afzal Hossein, Khairunnesa And you, Idul Aara I shall be back. To love, laugh, weave dreams on those strings of life Wait, O Motijhil, Shantinagar, the Book Fair in February I shall be back. A cloud flies from the West to the East I shall give her my teardrops So she may rain on tin roofs of homes, on the banks of the oval pond… Birds fly from West to East in Winter-time A feather each will they shed On leafy ponds On the Shitalakkha waters On the waters of Bengal’s Bay. Listen, O Brahmaputra! I shall be back! Listen, O Sal forests of Bihar! Mahasthangar, the mountains of Sitakund! I shall be back! If not in human form...
