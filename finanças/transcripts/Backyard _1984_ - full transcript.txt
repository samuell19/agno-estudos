Before this film begins I have to tell a story about my father and me. When I was 18 I left my home in North Carolina to go to college in New England and ended up living in Boston. Ever since then, my father, who was born and raised in the South, and I have disagreed about nearly everything. When I graduated from college, my father, who's a doctor and conservative republican, asked me what I planned to do with my life. I told him I was interested in film making but there was also several alternatives, such as working with Black Voter Registration in the South or getting involved in the Peace Movement, or possibly entering a Theravada Buddhist monastery. My father had thought this over for a moment and said, "Son, I think your concept of career planning "leaves something to be desired," "but I've decided not to worry about you anymore." "I've resigned myself to your fate." I didn't exactly know how to respond to this but finally I said, well, dad, I guess I have no choice but the accept your resignation. Here I am, playing the piano, in the house where I grew up in North Carolina. I guess about the only thing my father and I did agree upon was my decision not to try to make a living from my musical abilities. Anyway, I eventually got a job at a television station in Boston. I managed to save enough money to buy some film stock, and borrowed a camera, and returned home to make a film about the South, which for me meant making a film about my family. 150 over 70. My father is a surgeon. Scalpel. Both my father and grandfather chose to go into medicine, but I decided at a fairly early age not to become a doctor. In the past I've felt queasy when I've seen my father scalpel cut through warm, living flesh, but I discovered that as long as I was filming my father operating, this problem disappeared completely. Unfortunately I had other problems. It seemed that all too often when I tried to film my father, my camera malfunctioned. Since moving away I felt I had become a kind of stranger to my own family. My brother had even taken to calling me the Yankee. My mother died the year before I moved to Boston. My father has since remarried, and his new wife, Anne, suggested various activities for me to film around the house, such as the following ritual, which occurs every Christmas. ♪ Sleep in Heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Sleep in Heavenly peace ♪ Masses, y'all are mighty good to call, and to sing for us, we thank you. Thank you, Merry Christmas. I hope y'all have a real wonderful day. Congratulations, Jeannie and Mike. We thank you. Then you can meet with, Susie will see you next time, this is Peter Market saying, so long, we're breaking up, bye-bye! Nice colored copy they were. He had a carcinoma in his stomach, 10, 15, 10 years ago I guess. For some reason my father's wearing a yarmulke. Despite the fact that he's a staunch Presbyterian. Yeah, all right here he is, Tommy. Yeah. Telephone. Go around the index finger and around the thumb, around the index finger, around the thumb. I'm looping it, whoops. This one. My brother Tommy was about to begin medical school which pleased my father a great deal. Now you have to play it down that way. Down, up, down, up. They always like that, Milton? They always like that? Are these dogs always like this? Yeah, when they get close, just bark then. Sometimes we need to hall down the neighbors, looks like they'd get used to me sometimes. Galvin Stafford and his wife, Lucile have worked for my family for many years, and I was in part raised by Lucile and by other black women. As I grew up in the South I never questioned the fact that black men were taking care of the yard while their wives were taking care of me. Lucile, did you want to sit here? No, it's fine, I got to stay and watch the pot. Okay. Would you want some soup? No, thank you, not right now. Is he telling you, Lucy? Right now, DLT please. We're taking him out to dinner. Yes. I see you're tearing the tree house down. My tree house? Yeah, you'll live with that. Yeah, it's been there for too long, about time for it to come down. You never used Wister, did you? Did you ever spend a night out there? Oh sure, I spent the night out there a few times. Yeah, like in wind or snow. Kind of nice when the wind was blowing back and forth. I bet it is over there, in fact. I'll get out tonight, night time, bye-bye. Lucile was given the last of the clothing that had belonged to my mother. I had many contradictory feelings about being home again and I felt very awkward about filming members of my family. My grandmother tried to help me out by offering to sing some old songs for the camera and I was especially struck by the lyrics to one of her songs. ♪ Lime trees are blooming in the corner by the gaze ♪ ♪ Mammy and her little cabin door ♪ ♪ Curly headed pink nanny ♪ ♪ Coming home from school ♪ ♪ Just crying 'cause it's little heart and soul ♪ ♪ All the children round about have skin so light and fair ♪ ♪ And all of them with him were leather play ♪ ♪ But mammy in her lap takes this dusky little chap ♪ ♪ And she grooms in her own kind word ♪ ♪ Now honey, don't you mind what them white childs do ♪ ♪ And honey, don't you cry so hard ♪ ♪ Go out and play as much as you please ♪ ♪ But stay in your own backyard ♪ Crops? No, thank you. That counter, Lucile, you like that? It don't bother me. That just ain't starting. Holy Lord God almighty, what power and what greatness is in our midst right now, this is it. Yay! Yay! That should do it. Get rid of the ball, get out of those field chairs, leave those crutches, everybody get up and when you can see you can walk, come on over here, come on over here, one's getting up off the stretcher there, there, come on, come on, here they come, that man's leaving his crutch behind, come on, come on, get up and come on, this is the power of God, get up and walk, get up and walk, there comes grandmother walking, oh glory be to God. Come on, come on, come on, this is the greatness, come on people, this is the greatness of God, come on. This is the ante, hallelujah, give God a big hand. Okay, so I'm trying to figure out a month. I say 125 a month, spending money. Which is... $150 a month for food. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. What else? That's it. 275 a month. So I think you mail this out to me and then I'll write them the checks. Isabelle. Yeah? Good morning. How are you doing? Oh I'm doing well, I guess. Sounds like you didn't, kind of hurting there. I was hurting pretty bad when I have to get up to walk. Do you take some pain medicine? Do you ask for a pain pill? Well, once or twice I have and they gave it to me. Okay, you stay as comfortable as you can now, use the medicine, that's what it's for. All right, I will. Okay, we'll have you out of here soon. If we can get you to move on something, out comes that tube, okay? You understand? No, I don't know what you mean. As soon as you pass gas from the rectum, or start moving your bowels, then we can get the tube out, but it's not safe to take it out until that happens. I see. Else you might get all distended. I can't do anything, I mean. Yeah, yes you can. I can? Yeah. These are hot things. We're ahead of time with these over here. Well, I'm thinking to put on my hat and hood. I ain't getting my care. Else there's a lot to do. Clyde Kathy is a beekeeper who relies on visions from God to help him locate his swarms of bees. Now, don't you worry about, nothing will happen, as long as I got bees, you got bees. That's right. And I'm gonna keep them as long as I live. Lord let me. Clyde also works for my family. I got to get my gloves. I dreamt about bees two weeks every night, it's crazy, before I've come in contact with the bees and I didn't know the meanings of that, and I would tell my wife I dreamt about bees and she'd say that was a sign of a funeral, but to lord, I had prayed to the lord to give me a harvest and I dreamt about bees and I had found four swarms just where I dreamt and I seed four swarms and I went down there and got four swarms of bees and that's the last of that. One morning I encountered a neighbor who was on a mysterious mission. What time did they try to strike last time? It must've been around, probably yesterday it was probably around 11 o'clock, 11:15 something like that. They tried to get in the first floor or the second floor? Well if you look through here you can see where they get on the porch, and they apparently tried to get up, full up on that gutter and stay away. Even the Towns' across the street, did you hear about that, they caught a couple of teenage kids from Iris Park, they caught them. Nancy had come home from shopping and her back door was open, and she's just stepped in the house to hear somebody upstairs so she ran out and jumped in her car and saw a policeman driving down the street and ran after him and got him and they came running back and caught them. They'd already taken down radios and TV sets and lined them up in the kitchen ready to take them out and put them in the van. The alarm went off over the weekend at the Pro Shop at the Club. I just thought if that was related to this or not, I don't know. It would be exciting if they came right now while film is going. You have to able to identify all those flies. Just 300 more. Nothing on here that faintly resembles a bug. How much? You have seen, yeah, okay. Ledlum is about pass, he's had nausea and vomiting, I've put him in observation tonight, but he may have to come into hospital tomorrow. But since Helen Macker's authority bypass is asked, then we'd get him to take care of it. I encounter further technical difficulties. Okay Joe, take care. We'll be glad those big eyes are gone. My stepmother and I walked to a wedding at the Country Club, the bride, whose name is Kitty grew up in the house next door and my family had always hoped that I would settle down to marry someone like Kitty, but now in her case at least, it's too late. Clyde Kathy, the beekeeper also works for the family of the bride. I thought I'd come around and see you. Clyde, thank you. Take care of yourself, okay? No photo click, Ross? Such a sweetheart. Don't let Clyde cry, he'll make me cry. Bye, daddy. Safe cruise. Bye, love you all! Bye-bye! Blow, blow for them! The father of the bride graciously offers me a ride home. Ross, you want to go home? No, sir, I'll just go back with you. Okay, you live in my house? Right next door. Oh you live in my back yard, that's what I tell your daddy. Whose car is that? Mine. Is it Clyde's or his? I don't know. Who's that coming out? I don't know. Who's that? I don't know who it is. We're celebrating. What? A wedding. I decided to go back to the country club to take a second look around. Where's the flag? It's on the planet here, they probably already taken it down. They took the flag down, I'm late. Well, that's life. He's rolling that thing on us. He's rolling that on us. Yup, that's what I'm doing. He ain't gonna use all of it, don't worry about it. You spying all about the dirt around here? He just simply refused to eat and the doctor said that he was just malnutritioned, saying he was lower than anybody he ever saw to be walking around with malnutrition. I'm really sorry to hear about that. So he went on all day Saturday, and they gave him glucose and all day Sunday, they thought he was getting better and all of a sudden, Sunday afternoon he just had a slight heart attack. But he came out of that on Monday, and they put him back in his room, they took him out of the hot unit and put him back in the room, and then Tuesday morning at about 8 o'clock in the morning they had to do a Tracheal on him, you know that's, put that hole in there, and put the tube in him and for days he couldn't talk. I went with Lucile and Owen to visit Lucile's brother in the hospital. Something you want for yourself? Medal, shoes, you want some metal shoes on here? Nothing. That's not it. He does need something. You look good. What time is it? We got to leave him by three. You take it easy, and don't forget to pray. Okay, bye. It's the day before my brother leaves for medical school and my family's planned various activities in his honor. Well, I do think it's important how you're spending's your brother's expensive film on... Leaving town, on his way out! Tell him to at least stop for a quick beer with a dame. One, two, three, four. My brother and I spend the last day together. Not much more to be said, not to me. It's up to me now. I've much pressure on me, it's about half of shvarna. I'll hate to come back here if I screw up. Cast that new thing and go out with. All right, let's get this good photo, I got to get going, I don't want to stick around here any longer. Sick of it all. Three years ago my mother underwent surgery for cancer, she was then allowed to return home and she seemed to be doing fairly well, but one night she collapsed in the hallway. My father found her first and gave her artificial respiration and called for me between breaths, I called an ambulance and then ran back to the hallway to see if there was any way I could help my father. The ambulance arrived in the matter of minutes but my mother had died as my father and I held her. I have never been able to talk about that night with my father and I still didn't understand exactly why my mother had died so suddenly. Somehow I thought it would be easier to talk about it with my brother who I assumed knew more about it than I did because of his pre-medical training. Do you have any particular desire to work with cancer patients more than anybody else? Not really. You know, what about your mother's death, how do you deal with? Sometimes I think about that, but... Did you know how sick she was the entire time? Like right up until her death? I really don't even know how she died. I know about exact cause of her death, I mean you die of cancer, but I don't know if she had a pulmonary infarct or heart attack or what, I really do want to know what she died of though. I've just never found the right time to ask dad. One day I'll find out I guess. Well, I told him we'd loot the gains. Yeah, you sure did. I don't like camping out. You know I told you I lost both ones. If you lose two, that ain't bad, I say I lost both. That was hurting you pretty bad when that happened. I know it, I can't go out of here, I lost. Can them home, it's at home now. Now you see, that's why I keep a jar hanging around, they go down in there and they can't get out. You sure did. You killed them, didn't you? They go down in there and see if they go down in there, you understand and they think they can get out of here and they don't know how to come back out of the bottle. And if you're gonna let them eat honey out of the jar, you turn it like this. And they can go in and go out. They'll come in and go out. Thank you very much. Bye, bye. My father and I are getting along pretty well these days and I get back down to visit him whenever I can. He continues his medical practice and I continue to make films. My brother is now a surgeon and Lucile continues to keep the house in order while Nelvin keeps moving the lawn and basically things go along smoothly, pretty much the way they always have.
