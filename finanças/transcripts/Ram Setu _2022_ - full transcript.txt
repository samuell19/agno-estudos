Turn the cannon towards the statue. Done, sir. 3... 2... 1... Fire! Six years ago in Bamyan, Afhanistan Taliban committed a major crime against humanity. The massive Lord Buddha statues were bombed and blown to pieces destroying an integral part of our cultural inheritance. Under the supervision of UNESCO, an international team of archaeologists will arrive and restore what's left of the heritage structure. They will excavate the scattered remnants of the idols to build the Lord Buddha statue once again. On this mission we have archaeologists from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Japan and India. [Speaking in foreign language] Welcome to Bamyan. I don't see our Indian guest Mr. Aryan... don't tell me you abandoned him at the LOC, Mr. Bilawal? Would I dare to? Your guest is sitting beside the pilot, inside the cockpit. As usual India wants to be in 'control' of everything! Mister... I wasn't controlling him, I was trying to convince him. Our pilot was scared to fly here. He said, Bamyan is dangerous territory and it's not safe to fly down in a helicopter as the Taliban could bomb it. We couldn't possibly have driven down, so I held his hands and gave a long, emotional speech... to inspire him. Did your speech work its magic? No. The 100 dollars I gave him after the speech, worked its magic! I'm adding that to my Expense account. Sure. But your pilot wasn't wrong. The Americans too are scared of patrolling this area. We aren't here to patrol the area, we're here to restore the lost inheritance of Afghanistan. We have to overcome our fears... am I right, Bilawal? Absolutely, Mister-know-it-all. After Lord Buddha, you're the second person who has attained enlightenment. Go on, make fun of me. Let's go. The ear of the statue has been found. Here it is! It must've gotten buried here when the statue was bombed. Wonderful! Bilawal... What is it? There's a metallic object under this... There's something here. Did you just find a landmine? You know what, we should hand over this trench to the army. Let them pull off this stunt. Why do you Pakistanis call the army for every little thing? They won't be able to handle this. They'll destroy this site! We'll have to do it ourselves... carefully. Pull it out. Pull it out. Tamiko. Tamiko... come down. We've found something! Come. Brahmi script. This is an ancient Indian script. You might just have found the treasure looted by Mohammad Ghori. No... this dates back to an earlier period. Dahir Sen was the last Hindu king of Sindh, in the 7th century. These coins are from his time. People from Raja Dahir's kingdom might have travelled here. This area was a part of the Silk Route. Taliban are here! [Speaking in foreign language] [Speaking in foreign language] The Taliban are here... run! Taliban are here! Run! Let's go, Mr. Aryan... the Taliban are here. We'll collect the coins later, let's leave right now. These are not mere coins, Bilawal. Dahir Sen was the king of your Sindh too! This is a priceless legacy belonging to your country. His will get me killed in the name of the country! Hurry up! Let's go. Tamiko, sit in the car. Let's go. Fast! It's dangerous to stay here. Where can we go? Let's take refuge in Buddha. What do you mean? Come on, let's go. Hurry up! Reclining Buddha! Let's take refuge in Buddha. Thanks to Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha's bravery these priceless antiques could be saved from the Taliban. King Dahir's coins are an invaluable part of Pakistan's legacy. On behalf of the Pakistani government, I thank Dr. Aryan... As we fell into the ravine, we discovered a statue of Lord Buddha ...the reclining Buddha. Again, it is because of Dr. Aryan's courage that we made this new discovery. Wasn't only me... both of us were there. Not just for Pakistan and Afghanistan, Dr. Aryan has worked very hard to restore South Asian heritage. Therefore, we will give half the treasure to India. Thank you so much. Mr. Habibullah... King Dahir was a Hindu ruler... while Afghanistan and Pakistan are Islamic states. In that case, you should handover the entire treasure to India. Don't you agree? Don't you like peace among neighbouring countries? Mister... these coins are a part of our common inheritance. They can't be divided according to religion. Religion divides... while culture unites. Tell me, Dr. Kulshreshtha... Don't you believe in religion? In God? I don't believe in religion, God or any theory that can't be proven. I'm a man of facts. History. Archaeology. I believe only in things that can be proven, okay. Thank you. Good morning. Why did you have to make a speech on religion? Read what's written in the newspapers instead of your success story. Forget the newspaper, take a look at this paper. Your husband has been promoted by the ASI. That's wonderful. Congratulations, my Lord. You're calling your atheist husband a Lord, professor. People might get offended. Is Kabir still sleeping? Kabir? I'm here, Dad. You're on the sofa! Which comic book are you reading, son? Baby Ganesha. -Kabir-- -Nice! Go get ready for school. Why the sudden change in expression? That's not just a comic book, that's you trying to get Kabir to believe in God! I know you very well. Should I make him an atheist like you instead? Read the praises being heaped on you... they're slandering you. -And you want-- -Okay... let's not fight. It's my first day in office as Joint-Director General. Be nice to me. -Bye. -Bye. Don't demolish Ram Setu! As you can see, a large number of people have gathered here today, to oppose the Sethusamudram Project. According to the project, the Indian government and some private organizations will demolish Ram Setu to construct a shipping canal in its place to provide a shorter shipping route for trading. According to the people, Ram Setu was constructed by Lord Ram and is part of our cultural legacy... it should therefore not be destroyed. Don't demolish, don't demolish. Don't demolish Ram Setu! Don't demolish, don't demolish. Don't demolish Ram Setu! Don't demolish, don't demolish. Don't demolish Ram bridge! Don't demolish, don't demolish. Don't demolish Ram Setu! We immediately need to file a reply in the honorable Supreme Court. We? Mr Indrakant, the government will file the reply. We are simply giving you an update. Sathe, I invested in this project because you and your cabinet had given me assurance... now you're giving me an 'update'?! Sir... it is just a small headache. Someone has filed a public interest litigation in Court saying- The Sethusamudram Project will offend the religious sentiment of the people. We will challenge this. This country has deep faith in Shree Ram. How will you challenge this sentiment? I have a plan... Sir, I'll need some time to study the Ram Setu. I'll have to go on an expedition-- We don't have time for that, Aryan. All the government needs is an affidavit stating that Ram Setu wasn't built by Shree Ram, that it's a natural construction. Guess what, you've been highly recommended to make this report. Thank you very much, sir, but I need to research-- Go ahead. You've written a thesis on marine archaeology after all! Do you believe in God? No, sir. -Exactly. -But-- That's the reason you're the perfect guy to do this report. You're not religiously inclined, therefore you'll be able to see the truth. See... Ram Setu-- Is created by the process of sedimentation. I know, sir, but to prove it-- Prove it? You don't have to prove anything... you simply need to state it. The ASI is an authority on this matter. What we say is considered a fact. You can't go to Afghanistan for a month anyway... I mean, they're securing the site. Might as well serve your country in the meanwhile. Congratulations, young man... Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha, Joint Director. Professor! Professor... Where are you? Please give me a cup of tea, professor... Tea? You shouldn't even be given food today! What kind of report is this? Do you want our family to be thrown out of the country? Why are you reading my report? It was in the printer, that's why I read it. Aryan, how can you say that Shree Ram has no connection to the Ram Setu? I am only saying that Ram Setu is not a man-made structure. That's it! No, what you're doing is what happened in Ayodhya... How are Ram Setu and Ayodhya related, Gayatri? Both are connected to belief, Dr. Aryan. Just like Ayodhya connects the country to the birthplace of Shree Ram, Ram Setu is the bridge that connects their beliefs to the principles of Shree Ram. This is a baseless argument, professor. Ayodhya was a matter of land dispute. No! It was a matter of faith. Just like Ram Setu. Some people in Ayodhya made the mistake of asking for Shree Ram's birth certificate... remember what happened? But I'm not asking for Shree Ram's birth certificate! You're not asking for one... in fact, you're giving a certificate stating he didn't exist! Which is even more dangerous. Oh, come on. Aryan... your report questions the existence of Shree Ram in history... Don't do this. Please. Listen to me for once. I am simply doing my job, Gayatri. I'm not here to question Shree Ram's history. Ram Setu is part of Shree Ram's history. You've called 'Valmiki Ramayan' an epic, in your report. But for the people, it is part of history and Ram Setu is a part of that history. 'Valmiki Ramayan' is merely a piece of literature... Do you have any other proof? Isn't literature proof enough? The Mughals believed in the 'Ramayan' and considered Shree Ram a part of Indian history. Humayun's wife commissioned paintings of the 'Ramayan'... Akbar had got the 'Ramayan' translated to Persian... in fact, coins had also been issued... Siyaram coins! Please don't teach me my job, Gayatri. That's what I'm saying, Dr. Aryan- this is not your job! Your job is digging up graves... not to question the belief of the people. When will you understand this? In the Supreme court, the government submitted Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha's report on Sethusamudram today. The report states, Ram Setu wasn't built by any person or Lord Ram... Rather it is a result of natural phenomenon. This report also states that the 'Ramayan' is an imaginary epic. Belief cannot replace science therefore, this epic cannot be considered history. My Lord, the petitioner believes that around seven thousand years ago, Shree Ram, the king of Ayodhya, had built the Ram Setu. My question is, in which engineering college all this is taught? There is no proof that Shree Ram or Ram Setu actually existed in history. My Lord, denying the existence of Shree Ram is like denying the existence of the Indian civilization. This is an attack on the very foundation of India. As you can see, the argument on Ram Setu is not just limited to the Supreme Court... it has reached the common man as well. Our government is in a hurry to demolish the bridge, they're not willing to study it properly. I go fishing near Ram Setu. We worship this Setu that was built by Lord Ram. The Court asked the government to introspect and reconsider the contents of this affidavit which could be detrimental to the cultural harmony of the nation. First it was Ayodhya, now it is Ram Setu. Some anti-Hindus want to toy with our history, beliefs and traditions. If they come to demolish it, we will stand in front of it and protect it! The Court directs the government to provide scientific evidence to substantiate their claim that Ram Setu is a natural formation and not a man-made structure. The Indian government is answerable for this. Someone will have to pay the price for this. Sir, I made the report after showing it to the legal team. Why didn't you send it to the ministry first for approval, before sending it to the lawyers? Aryan, I only asked you to state that Ram Setu is a natural formation. But you have raised questions on the historical significance of the 'Ramayan'. Why did you have to call the 'Ramayan' an epic? All hell has broken loose now. Sir, I was simply arguing that every incident mentioned in the 'Ramayan' can't be believed to have actually taken place. I was going for the jugular. Now they are going for the jugular. Aryan, why don't you understand... you know it, I know it... in this country, people believe that literature is also a part of historical records. Okay! I will not be the scapegoat... you have to lie low for some time. Are you suspending me? Thank your stars it's only a suspension and not a departmental enquiry. Do you know, the government had to withdraw the affidavit... apologize to the people... Do you know how embarrassing it is? I'm getting late, Aryan. Hurry up and give Kabir's lunchbox, please. Okay... The toast is ready, I'm making the omelet... You eat the omelet, I'm getting late for my lecture. Sorry. Don't be. Toast is fine. I'm not talking about the toast. I'm apologizing because I didn't pay heed to what you said. Don't think about it too much. Now stay away from this controversy. Okay? Okay. -And rest properly today. -Okay. Listen, the maid won't come for work today... you'll manage, right? And what about my rest? You can rest after you finish all the work! Bye. Kabir! Let's go... Because of the Sethusamudram controversy, the government has suspended Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha... a senior ASI officer. His views on the 'Ramayan', in the government report is the reason behind this decision. His report has angered the nation... Yes, sir? What are you doing, Aryan? I'm cleaning the house, sir. What can I do for you, sir? I'm feeling really bad for you. The government has over-reacted... You know how politics is. Hard decisions need to be made under pressure from the public. But mind you, your work has not gone unnoticed. Some bigwigs are very happy with your report. And who are these bigwigs, sir? Come and meet me at Le Regency at 12. I want you to meet someone. Come with me, Aryan. Let's go. He's waiting for you. In fact, he had just called... Twice. Sir, isn't Pushpak Shipping a private company? They're very close to the government. They're pretty much the government themselves. I met Mr. Indrakant through the minister. Big man... very big man. Are you getting late for something, Aryan? Sorry, sir... I will go home and cook. Hello. Sir, Aryan. I have heard a lot about you. Being an archaeologist, you must be fond of old things. This is a model of my new ship. I would proudly say, this is the best ship on water! But there is a small issue. It is a fuel-guzzler! I had thought the shipping route would get shorter because of the Sethusamudram Project. It'll reduce the travelling time by 36 hours and distance by 400 nautical miles. It would save time and fuel... and the country would profit from this. I don't know why these people are against progress. Influencing mob shouting slogans! Sir, this is why our country is lagging behind. They've embroiled Ram Setu in a religious controversy, hampering progress. I've read your report, Aryan. It was an honest and true report. I want you to write another report on this... more detailed, well-researched with scientific evidence. So that we can submit in Supreme Court. But my report will have no value, sir. I have been suspended by the ASI. ASI! It can suspend an archaeologist but not the truth. Well said, sir. Well said! I will help you... for an archaeological expedition to Ram Setu. Do your research and collect evidence... and scientifically prove that Ram Setu is not a man-made structure. Sir will provide you with facilities that the ASI cannot. I have deep-sea access. The government will help us... this is the time to go for the truth! Your offer is great, sir. But the people of this country don't want to hear the truth, they only want to hear what they think is the truth. I don't want to be a part of this controversy. I just want to stay away from all this. You had questioned the sanctity of the 'Ramayan' in your report. Your very name is a controversy now. You may stay away from it but the controversy will not stay away from you. Sleep over it. "We Shall Overcome, we shall overcome." "We shall overcome someday." "Oh, deep in my heart." "I do believe." "We shall overcome someday." Well done! Well done, kids. In this year's Annual Day, we will have an inter-school fancy-dress competition. Kabir, you should dress up as Ravana (villain in the 'Ramayan'). Why Ravana? Because your dad doesn't believe in Shree Ram... maybe you belong to Ravana's family! -Thank you. -Thank you, sir. Give it. Quick! What are you doing? Who are you? Hello... Yes, this is Kabir's father. What!? It was shocking, the way Kabir beat up this little boy. Where did he learn this violent behavior? I don't know, ma'am... Ours is a peace-loving family. But it's not right to call someone Ravana either. I'm sure you understand. It's verbal bullying. My Chintu is not a bully. Kids playfully tease each other... that doesn't mean your son has the right to beat him up. What Kabir did was in the heat of the moment, otherwise we are from a cultured family. Cultured family my foot! Anyone who doesn't believe in Shree Ram deserves to be insulted! Don't get personal. Don't get personal now! Wasn't beating up my son, a personal matter? Does that mean you'll swear at us? -You think you'll get away with this? -How dare you! -Ma'am... -Cool down! -Do you know what-- -Cool down, I said! Mr. Kulshreshtha, consider this a last warning. This school will not tolerate any kind of violence. Do you understand? You may go now. Dad got scolded because of me. It's okay. You reacted because you were angry. But next time no fighting, Kabir. He insulted us. Why does everyone hate Dad? Cultured family, my foot! Anyone who doesn't believe in Shree Ram deserves to be insulted! Your very name is a controversy now. You may stay away from it but the controversy will not stay away from you. Thank you. Is Kabir asleep? Yes. He felt terrible about the Principal scolding you because of him. That's okay. But what he was told... that is more worrying. I have to clear my name, Gayatri. Are you thinking of going back to that mess? No. I am talking about how I can get out of the mess. That man didn't just insult me today... he judged my family as well. And for what? Just because I was suspended for... blasphemy, that's all? I'm a scientist, I will protect my family -with hard evidence, with truth-- -Enough of this, Aryan... -with facts and-- -What are you even saying, Aryan? What you're planning to do will put the family into danger. What do you want... people to throw stones at our house? For them to make our lives miserable? Gayatri, I'd told you this is a scientific expedition which will bring out the truth. The truth will shake the foundation of an age-old belief. Indrakant is a nice man. He is sending me fully equipped to Ram Setu. And I would request you please don't stress me out. Fine. Thank you. I too will go 'fully equipped' to my parents' house in Varanasi. Go ahead and complete your agenda for the government. Gayatri... Be assured that whatever you asked for has been provided on the ship and much more... Best of luck! Thank you very much. -Dr. Aryan? -Yes. Approaching Ram Setu. Please wear your seatbelt. In this area, the weather is very unpredictable. -Hi. -Hi, I'm Bali. Project manager. -Pleasure meeting you. -Likewise. Come. Come. Mr. Indrakant was hell-bent... no matter what, every facility should be provided here. I'll introduce you to everyone... we have experts from all over the world here. Ladies and gentleman, I present to you Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha. Hi. Dr. Chandra, specializes in under-water research. Dr. Gabrielle, geologist from Brazil... world's leading expert in carbon-dating using the AMS technique. No way, I can't believe that this ship has a dedicated AMS machine for carbon-dating. Well, we spared no expense. For this mission we have all the state-of-the-art technologies. Professor Andrew, head of Remote Sensing. He will help you capture sonar images of the Ram Setu. Udyan and his team... they are our scuba divers. Hi. Dr. Sandra Rebello, environmental scientist from Goa. Along with religious fanatics, some environmentalists are also against this project. Mr. Indrakant is covering all the bases. Okay. Dr. Sandra Rebello will prove that the Sethusamudram Project will not harm nature. Right? Right. That's really impressive. Nice meeting all of you. But, Mr. Bali... I'd requested for another member for the team. I know. I was keeping it for the last. Udyan... Meet Makar... your exosuit. Your personal submarine... That you can wear and remain under the deep sea for hours. This has inbuilt oxygen and air pressure maintenance. There is no danger of decompression sickness. You'll be flying underwater, just like Ironman. Let's go for a dip tomorrow morning. As you wish. But I have one request... we are very close to Sri Lankan waters a civil war is going on between the government and rebels. Conduct your research in the Indian territory. Please. Sure. We have taken sonar pictures of the Ram Setu ...to create this 3-D image which has never been done before. As you can see, the bridge which is submerged under the sea is a 35km long stretch, connecting Pamban Island of Tamil Nadu to Mannar Island of Sri Lanka. At some points it reaches 3.5km in width and up to 10m in depth. Thank you, professor. Dr. Chandra, what's your opinion on why the Ram Setu is submerged under the sea. Well, because of global warming, the sea level rises a little every year. Right now, Ram Setu is about 6-feet under sea level. That means, this structure is thousands of years old. But we can determine its actual age after testing samples of the bridge. 'Dating the Era of Lord Ram' by Pushkar Bhatnagar... this book, on the basis of archeo-astronomy, gives us the exact dates of the incidents of the 'Ramayan'. Sage Valmiki has described star and planetary positions in various places, in the 'Ramayan'. These positions don't get repeated for thousands of years. Pushkar Bhatnagar studied these very planetary positions to deduce when Shree Ram was born... which is roughly seven thousand years ago. To be precise, Shree Ram was born on 10th January, 5114 BC... We have to prove, Ram Setu is more than seven thousand years old ...it predates Lord Ram. Exactly! Now let's find some evidence. Sigma to Base. It's a GO for descent. Copy that. All set? Yeah. Aryan, you must retrace your steps on your way back else your cable might get entangled. Copy that. Approaching Ram Setu. Oh my God! Guys, can you see this? It looks like an engineering marvel. I'm climbing down into the base of the structure. Okay, Aryan, turn right. Yeah, right there! I need samples of these corals to test for transplantation possibilities. Copy that. Aryan, Gabrielle has finished carbon dating the sediment samples that you brought. We have found some fossils in the samples, which are about 18 thousand years old. 18 thousand years! This means, Ram Setu is much older than seven thousand years. The bridge is older than Shree Ram. This is a good piece of evidence but it's not enough to substantiate our claim. We need more proof. We need to find out the age of the stones that form the main structure of Ram Setu. We have already studied the sediment... why do we need to find these stones? They're of the same age, aren't they? Not necessarily. This sediment is like cement plastered on a wall. We will have to study the bricks as well. The bricks of the Ram Setu are... floating rocks. The floating rocks. In order to reach those rocks, we will have to break the structure. Which is... impossible. According to this sonar image, here... near the Gulf of Mannar, the upper portion of the Ram Setu looks weak. There might be loose rocks in this area. That is a possibility. Aryan, this area is very close to the Lankan waters ...our boundary. Bali, I'll be careful. I promise. Alpha to Base. Divers are saying, the rocks are not coming out of Ram Setu. I repeat. The rocks are not coming out. Don't go there, Aryan. Those are Lankan waters. Remain in our zone. I spot a floating rock, Bali. One rock is all I need. It won't take more than a few minutes. Aryan, do as you're told. Aryan, follow the rules! Aryan, do you copy? Aryan! No... No! No... He ejected from the exosuit. Where the hell is Aryan? Where has he disappeared, goddammit! Is that him? Where? There! How is he walking in middle of the sea? He is walking on Ram Setu. The water there is less than six-inches deep. Could be a pumice stone. I don't think so. Pumice stone is made of lava and there has been no volcanic activity in this area in thousands of years. This is something else. I had told you not to enter Lankan waters. According to the 'Ramayan', Ram Setu was made with such floating rocks. In order to disprove this theory, it's vital to study these rocks. Gabrielle, let's study the rock in the lab. Chandra was right. This is not a pumice stone. Then what is it? Not something I've seen before. Aryan... the coral samples we've got have evidence of loose marine sand at the base. This is not possible. It seems, these corals have been planted here. What do you mean they are planted? Are you saying they have been brought from somewhere else? Yeah. Is it possible that they floated here because of the tide? No, there is no chance of that. They have been deposited in a linear manner... smaller corals on larger corals. There's a really, really clear pattern here. I'm sure someone has brought them here deliberately. To put it better, these corals have been planted in a straight line to build Ram Setu. They seem to be part of the bridge's structure. Holy shitz! This is not possible. What happened? The organic remains in this rock are roughly seven thousand years old... much younger than any fossils found in the marine sediment. That proves... If the organic remains found in this rock are seven thousand years old, this rock was brought here around that time. And, Sandra... your research shows, the corals were brought here from somewhere else. Then...? Then... This could mean that the Ram Setu structure is actually seven thousand years old ...and man-made! Seven thousand years would mean... Period of Shree Ram! So now you want to prove that Ram Setu was indeed built by Shree Ram! My job is to unveil history. Do you understand what 'history' means? 'It thus happened!' The truth will come to light. Good evening, team. I received your message, Aryan. So do you think this is a man-made structure? Well, sir this is what the evidence proves... Sandra and Gabrielle also agree with me. What do you think, Dr. Chandra? Well... I still believe Ram Setu is a natural structure. Okay. Aryan, continue your research with Sandra and Gabrielle. Dr. Chandra, continue working on your theory. Thank you, sir. No... I must thank you, Aryan. Your impartiality is commendable. I suggest, to dispel all doubt break a section of the structure of Ram Setu and collect rock samples. This rock was found floating nearby. We need clinching proof. I agree, sir but breaking a part of the Ram Setu might invite controversy. Not in Sri Lanka. You can do whatever you want with the portion of the bridge that is situated in Sri Lanka. I'll speak to the Lankan government and make arrangements. But you'll have to do this work at night so that not too many people find out. I suggest, you do it tonight. Sir, there's a civil war going on there. Relax, Bali. I know what I'm doing. Give Aryan full assistance. Right, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Bali, there's a storm warning at 2100 IST. Have you made the required adjustments in the submarine? I've conducted the safety checks as per your brief. Good. Aryan, you'll enter Lankan waters in 15 minutes. Remember to go as deep as possible. Copy that. Sandra, I don't trust him. Yeah, he doesn't seem very happy with the development. That's why I kept the floating rock in my bag. What?! What are you two whispering? Gabrielle is carrying the floating rock in her bag! What?! Descending 50-feet. 100-feet. 150-feet. 200-feet. Descending 300-feet. We've entered Sri Lankan waters. This is it. This is the Gulf of Mannar. We should drill into this portion. What's happening? It's a storm. But why is the engine overheating? I've lost control over the submarine. Submarine has completely shut down. Oxygen levels? Depleting fast... Good. Soon they won't be able to breathe. Didn't they know about this storm? This was such a bad plan! Actually it is a bloody good plan! They've sent us to die on this mission. What about the emergency blow? Even if they bring the submarine to the surface, it'll be impossible for them to swim in this storm. Bali... The floating rock is missing! What do you mean it's missing? I think Gabrielle took it with her. The engine has shut. The oxygen level is low. There's a storm in the sea and we have no life jackets. Oh my God! Gabrielle... take shallow breaths. We need to conserve oxygen. When I said I don't trust Bali, I didn't mean this! This is a planned murder. We have to reach the surface. I'm applying the emergency blow now. It's the only thing that'll work without the engine. I'd suggest, brace yourself. Okay. Brace yourself. Give me your hand, Gabrielle! Come on. There's a storm up there. Hold on to it tightly. Where is she? Where is she? Gabrielle... -Gabrielle... -Are you okay? I can't swim. Gabrielle, hold the floating rock. Hold the floating rock. Hold it properly. Don't leave it. Aryan! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Hand... Hold my hand! Oh my god. Thank god! Aryan, careful! Welcome to Sri Lanka. Myself Anjaneya Pushpakumaran. You can call me AP. Let's go! You can't study the Ram Setu like this. AP will help you. AP knows Ram Setu like the back of his hand. How? I used to be a tourist guide. After civil war broke out, I earn a living by fishing. Please... tell us what you know. Okay. Ram Setu used to be a proper bridge... there was an earthquake 700 years ago and the bridge broke. Do you have any evidence? You want evidence? In the 'Mahabharata', Ghatotkach crossed this bridge to meet his Lankan family. 1000 years ago, the Persian writer Alberuni wrote about this bridge in his book 'Kitab ul Hind'. I'm talking about scientific records. You want scientific records? Yes. According to 'Ramayan' the bridge dimention ratio is 100:10. Ram Setu is 35km long and 3.5km wide... what is the ratio? Same. 100:10 Scientific record! I know... but this isn't enough to prove it. AP can take you to the middle of Ram Setu and get you a rock. A floating rock, 5-times the size of this one! Still find it funny? Be nice... AP has access. Go there in the morning and take as many rocks as you wish. -Really? -Yeah. Mr. AP, why do you want to help us? What will you gain out of this? Good question. I'm a guide... your journey is my gain. All that I do to help you, I'll write in this diary. You can settle the account after the journey ends. Okay. How much are you charging us for saving our lives? That is complimentary. AP got clients because he saved you. Aryan, why do you want to go back to Ram Setu? Those people want us dead. We already have one rock. It's enough as evidence. Let's just fly back to Delhi. We can't go back after coming this far. I want to study the core of Ram Setu. I'd say... let's just give it one more day. Okay? Thank you. They were able to get out of this but they wouldn't have survived last night's storm. Can't take a chance. They have a sample of the rock. There are many small islands here... we must take a look. -Come on, let's go. -Yes, sir. The Sri Lankan navy might be present near the Ram Setu. Is it safe to go to the Sri Lankan coast now? We don't have our passports. I'm more worried about dying. You don't need a passport for that! -AP... -Yes? Did you get this scar during the civil war? No, this is AP's childhood memory. When I was a child, I wanted to fly like a bird. One day, I stretched out my hands and jumped out of the window. But no flying... crash landing! Seven stitches. -AP... -Yes? Turn the boat around. Bali! Turn the boat around! -But why? -Oh my God! Make a U-turn, AP. Why a U-turn? -Come on. -This is my area... I'll negotiate... Hold this. Take the boat over there. AP... Hello... These are my tourists. Don't come here. Go! U-turn! U-turn! Faster! Faster! Aryan, please. Faster! Faster... Faster! AP call friends. Go to island fast. Okay. Faster. Faster, please... Come on, everybody. Let's go! Come on, Gabrielle Aryan, wait. Run fast. Come on, everybody. Come on. Both of you go to the helicopter. I'll get her. -Okay. Come on. -Gabrielle... Madam, get up. Bag! I'll get it. Don't worry. Go... Wait! Run! Take it lower, take it lower! Come faster. Come faster. Run fast. Jump. Come on. Move! -Gabrielle! -Come on. -Run! -Come on. Come on, Gabrielle. Fast. Come on, Gabrielle. Get in. Where's AP? Hold my hand! Hold my hand! Hold my hand! -AP. -Move! Come on. Jump. AP. Are these your friends? They are rebels fighting against the government. Throttle up! Faster, throttle up! Where's the rock? Let's save our lives first. Throttle up, throttle up! Tell him to fly towards Ram Setu. Towards Ram Setu. Are you mad? Forget the rock now! I want to go back! Nobody will trust us if we don't have the evidence. I don't care. I'm out of this! No! Why do you want to go back to Ram Setu? We already have one rock. It's enough as evidence. Let's just fly back to Delhi. The three of them were just spotted in Jaffna. I've alerted the local authorities. You have to tighten the noose and finish them! But I want the rock before that. But, sir, it's very difficult to get to that side. None of the flights are landing in Jaffna. Come on... Your flight will land in Jaffna but give me some time to pull a few strings. In the meantime, ask Dr.Chandra to complete his final report. So that we can submit in the Supreme Court. Immediately! Copy that. I'll just come. What do you want? Do you have a sat phone? -Will try. -Can you arrange? Mr. Aryan... don't feel sad. AP has arranged a satellite phone for you. Speak to your family. Privacy? Okay... Sethusamudram Project has a glimmer of hope. According to the new report submitted by the government in the Supreme Court... Ram Setu was built much earlier than the period of Ramayan. Please sir tell us... It is a big day today... Being a responsible government, we formed a team of scientists from all over the world. They studied the fossils that were found in Ram Setu and found out that the bridge which is a natural formation, is about 18 thousand years old. This proves that Shree Ram did not build this bridge. After the submission of this report, Court has given the opposition three days to file their reply. If they are unable to file a suitable reply, a part of Ram Setu's structure will be demolished. -Gunnu! -Yes? Come here, quick. Pushpak Shipping Company has... Be right there. What happened? Namaste, Mr. Chaddha. Namaste, Gayatri. There's a phone call for you. -At your house? -Yes. Gayatri... Aryan? Why are you calling me here? Your phone might be tapped. Forget that. I'm sorry. You've completed the mission, isn't it? You must be happy. What do you mean completed the mission'? It was being shown on TV... The government has submitted a scientific report in Court... stating that the Ram Setu is eighteen thousand years old... demolition of Ram Setu starts in three days. I'm sure you must've made this report. No! Not at all! Indrakant has used Chandra's report. He tried to silence us as well but we managed to escape. What-- Tried to silence you? Escaped? Tell me everything that happened. Aryan, where are you? Somewhere in Sri Lanka. What are you doing in Sri Lanka? It's a long story, I'll tell you later. Weren't you supposed to be at Ram Setu? Yes I was... but now Indrakant wants me dead. What?! That's why it's difficult for me to go there. I've even lost the rock from Ram Setu. I will have to search for another rock... Because that rock is the only evidence to prove that Ram Setu was man-made. What are you even saying, Aryan? You cannot risk your life for another rock! Leave everything and come home right now. Enough of your obsession with Ram Setu! But, Gayatri it's not just about Ram Setu. If I find any solid evidence about Shree Ram, I'll be able to prove that 'Ramayan' is not just an epic but our history as well. What evidence are you talking about? We are one of the oldest civilizations in the world. It's impossible to find archeological evidence. This is a lost cause. Just come back, please. What's that noise? Hello? Hello... Aryan? Hello, Aryan... Hello, can you hear me? Aryan, are you okay? Hello... Hello... Hold on, professor. A large part of Ramayan took place in Lanka... Yes, but you'll only find evidence of Ravana there... -not Shree Ram. -Exactly. If I can prove that Ravana existed... it will automatically prove the existence of Shree Ram! Not much research has been done on the Ramayan, in Sri Lanka. I'm sure there are high chances of finding evidence here. Makes sense. But Jaffna is in middle of a civil war. Please be careful. I'm worried about you. Don't worry... your Lord Hanuman will protect me. I'm sorry again. Take care. Sandra, if we find the archaeological remains of Ravana's Lanka here... no one will be able to question Ramayan and Ram Setu. Where do we start? Will the government of Sri Lanka support us? Why not? AP has friends. Do you have friends in both camps? In the civil war... they're all our people. That's why AP is a friend to all. You're also my friends... and AP is ready to help. But you need to pay me a little extra for this. Of course. Tell me... if we're looking for Ravana's Lanka in present day Sri Lanka, where can we find clues? I've heard, Jaffna Public Library has maps and drawings made on palm leaves ...documentation of thousands of years of history. You'll surely find clues about Ravana in them. You would know something... Give me some idea please. Feeling jealous? No way! He's not even my type. And this library is also not my type. Forget about thousand-year old manuscripts, these books aren't even 50-years old! What's wrong? Thank you. Bye. Let's go! We have to leave immediately. Forget the book. Why forgetting? The palm leaf book has been found. Which section? It's not in this library. I'll tell you about it outside. The library was set on fire in the 1981 riots. Many of the historical documents were burnt but an old librarian managed to save some manuscripts. He will meet us now and show us the book. Why didn't he return those documents to the library? There's a civil war going on! That book is priceless, it can't be risked again. I see. Did that girl tell you all this? Yes, turns out she's from my village. Very nice lady. Where will we find the librarian? -Both of you are on the 'wanted' list... -Yes. we'll have to meet him in secret. I'll set up the meeting. Both of you go to the hotel... keep this phone with you and wait for my message. What happened? There There There... Look there Look there! Let's go. This side. Move. Let's go. Fast! Hey! Grab him! Fast. -Why you running like this?! -Sorry... Go... Who's that?! Come on. Aryan! Oh no! Hold my hand. What would we do? No! Come, let's go. Fast. Jump. -No Need. -What? [Speaking in tamil] Move. [Railway announcement] Attention please. Train will be leaving shortly. Please mind the closing door. They are escaping... [JAFFNA FORT 7 P.M.] This man is no ordinary librarian. Seven generations of his family have been protecting this secret manuscript. He likes your cause ...this is why he's showing this book to you. This manuscript is at least 400-years old. But he said these records are thousands of years old. The records are thousands of years old but the manuscript needs to be changed every 400-500 years. See this... these are palm leaves. They have to be changed because they get decayed. Found anything? There's a design of a secret tunnel... probably made by Mayasur. Who's Mayasur? Mayasur was Ravana's father-in-law who had built Lanka. I think he was the one who built this maze of tunnels. They've drawn the secret tunnel which is spread across hundreds of kilometers. Show me... This is Wariyapola... This is Ashok Vatika... Ravana's palace. Ravana's palace! Ravana's palace? Golden Lanka! Golden Lanka was built in a triangular shape. Triangular shapes were used extensively in ancient civilizations. From Egyptian pyramids to Greek architecture... and our own temples. It's everywhere. Okay. But how will we reach this tunnel? Ashok Vatika is the closest among these... we can enter the secret tunnel from there. Please consider the travel expenditure separately. Can I? Photo? Thank you. Nuwara Eliya... a tea plantation from the British era ...colonial feel, plus religiously very important. Locals say, Ravana had kept mother Sita here ...Ashok Vatika that's mentioned in the 'Ramayan' ...also has Seetha Amman temple. Very very famous tourist spot. If Ravana's tunnel was indeed situated here, everyone would've known about it because it's a tourist spot. No point in going there. They might demolish Ram Setu in a couple of days. We need to find the secret tunnel soon. Doesn't the map have any clues about where the tunnel opens? Looks like the face of an animal or a demon. Show me! This reminds me of Mutalai. Mutalai? A relative of yours? Very funny... Mutalai means 'crocodile'. Crocodile. Oh yes. This looks like a crocodile. AP, are there crocodiles in this area? Sri Lanka has a plenty of them but not sure about this area. Is there any lake or river in this area? There is a waterfall... Ravana Ella. According to folklore, Ravana used to sit there and play veena. Let's go there then. This tunnel is definitely near a water body. Sure. We'll rent a car from the station. Sleep... Sir, that librarian sent those three to meet this old man. They were looking for this map. Ask him where are they first headed to? Hey! Where didt hey go first?! Ashok Vatika. Nuwara Eliya. They've left a few hours ago. Once Aryan enters the tunnel, it'll be difficult to find him. Ask Silva to take out the bird. Let's search the region of Ashok Vatika. -Copy. -Leave book! Move! How much farther will you make us walk? You'd said you'd rent a car from the station. If you change plans last minute, how will we get a car? We have to take lift now. -Stop. -Stop. Stop. [Speaking in tamil] [Speaking in tamil] [Speaking in tamil] [Speaking in tamil] [Speaking in tamil] [Speaking in tamil] He's coming. What did he say? They're returning from a wedding. The groom wants you to sing a song. I can't. I don't know how to sing. You're an Indian, aren't you? Yes. Sing a Bollywood song. My wife wants... Any song will do. What do you mean? I'm an archeologist, not an 'Indian Idol' contestant. Why don't you sing. I can't sing. You sing? I know only Tamil songs. He wants to hear a Bollywood song they might throw us out of the bus your wish. Come on. I can't sing, no way... Try. Try. Sing the song or we throw you out! Try! "It's time for celebration" "For the wedding party" "The groom and bride are right here" "And they are holding hands" "A 'filmy' song is playing" "And I'm making up the lyrics" "Mr. Groom, why don't you tell me" "Who I should get to the dance floor" "I'm celebrating the wedding of someone unknown" "But I'll make sure everyone has fun" "Welcome, welcome" "What a fun! What a fun!" "Welcome, welcome" "What a fun! What a fun!" "Welcome, welcome" "What a fun! What a fun!" "Welcome, welcome" "What a fun! What a fun!" "Romance is but a gamble" "And love is a game" "In which we think of only one person day and night" "Bring out the gifts" "And enjoy yourselves" "As you play the lovers' game" "I know for sure" "Whether it's Delhi or down South" "Everyone gets drunk at weddings" "If it's true love" "And you're sure about your feelings" "That, my friends, is priceless" "It's a beautiful day" "With dreams abounding" "The henna on the bride's hands" "Bear witness to their love" "Color yourself with the color of love" "Enjoy and live the life that you wish to" "Welcome, welcome" "What a fun! What a fun!" "Welcome, welcome" "What a fun! What a fun!" "Welcome, welcome" "What a fun! What a fun!" "Welcome, welcome" "What a fun! What a fun!" There! See that... something is moving in the water. That's a dwarf crocodile. It could be a cave crocodile... small crocodiles like these, that live in caves, are also found in Africa. -AP... -Yes? -Can you follow that crocodile please? -Sure. The lake ends here. What do we do now? Where did the small crocodile we were chasing go? The crocodile led us here. Is the tunnel inside this rock? There is no opening... How could this be a tunnel? This crocodile chase was a stupid idea. Maybe we should've gone to Ashok Vatika. I think we're at the correct location. Guys, come here. AP, come here. See the reflection of this rock on the water. Rock? Crocodile! Crocodile on the map is an inverted image of this rock. Right! The tunnel could be under water... Let's go. Where? Under water? This lake is very dangerous. AP won't go into 'crocodile water'. -Come on, AP... -It's a small crocodile. No, sir. Come on, AP... You're not coming? No, sir. -Sure? -Sure. Fine. Forget about your fees. Let's go... How can I forget about it? I've kept an account of everything. AP is coming... -Double charge for this! -AP! Aryan. Aryan... Aryan! What the hell! Aryan! Stop shouting. Oh my God... We are inside the rock now... This is the tunnel. Come on. Let's move. Thank god these bags are waterproof. What are you doing, AP? There could be wild animals inside... I'm making a torch. Sir, I've reached Ashok Vatika. They haven't come here. A man matching Aryan's description was spotted near the waterfall, a few hours ago. No trace of them after that. I think they've found the tunnel. The court's deadline will soon end. We have to remain careful till... the start of bridge's demolition. Do you have a map of the tunnel? Yes, sir. Reach the spot where the tunnel opens. And wait for that bloody rat to come out of the hole! Sir, there are a dozen places the tunnel opens at... I think Aryan will emerge from either of these two places... Sri Pada, on Adam's Peak mountain or... Wariyapola, also known as Ravana's airport. No... we cannot second-guess this. We have to get an expert to study this map... someone who thinks like Aryan. Okay, sir. I know just the person. -Aryan! -Po! What "Po"? What "Po"? Bloody bats! Okay sir? Which way now? Take a look at the map and tell me. This intersection isn't there in the map. What?! One, two, three... What are you doing? Hello... what are you doing? One should count when confused. We should go in the direction the count ends. Any problem? Go ahead. I forgot because of you... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.. Nine,... ten! Aryan... Give me the torch. What happened, Aryan? Aryan? Hela script! What is Hela? Aryan, what is Hela? Ancient script of Lanka... thousands of years old. Some of its symbols have been deciphered. AP... AP... Come here. What happened? All okay? Look... What's written here? Ravalu... could mean 'Ravana'... Helatuva... island of Hela people... The middle word looks like 'radhaya' ...could mean 'Ravana, the King of island'. Why are these inscriptions written on the ceiling? These might be secret directions to the tunnel. Why is the Hela script written in a particular direction? I think let's follow the script. Come on, let's go. Let's go. I told you... AP is always right. Nine, ten, it stopped at this tunnel. Didn't I tell you? Yes, you did tell us. Come on. The final hearing on the Sethusamudram case will take place in Supreme Court tomorrow. The government has asked for Court's permission to demolish Ram Setu. As per the government, all departments working on this project are ready and waiting. As this news broke, Pushpak Shipping Corporation shares saw a rise. I would like to remind you, after the final hearing tomorrow afternoon... Supreme Court might give permission for Ram Setu to be demolished. This is incredible. If I had time, I would've decoded all these inscriptions now. We'll now be able to prove that this tunnel is man-made... built during Ravana's era. We might even come across Ravana's Lanka... -Hey... -Yes? Look in front. Ravana's palace! Same to same triangle! Golden Lanka! According to the map, there should be three pathways but there are only two. The right one leads to Wariyapola and the left one to Sri Pada. One minute... Oh no, the third pathway that leads to Ravana's Lanka is behind this wall. Looks like someone has blocked it with this rock. AP... Yes? We'll have to break this rock... Seems like all the walking has turned your brain into mush. We have only two options... left or right. AP feels we should go left. Sri Pada religiously very important. Let's go to Wariyapola. If it's known as Ravana's airport... there might be archaeological remains over there. Wariyapola is a tourist spot... We'll only find Japanese and Chinese tourists there, no archaeology. Let's go to Sri Pada... I promise we'll find Ravana there... Shree Ram too. People say Sri Pada fulfills all prayers. You should go there and offer your prayers. No, we don't have time to offer prayers. We need hard evidence. Let's go to Wariyapola. Thank you. Sri Pada is also known as Trikut mountain in Lanka. Trikut mountain? Golden Lanka was visible from Trikut mountain... If Sri Pada is the Trikut mountain mentioned in 'Ramayan', we might find evidence of Golden Lanka near it. I think what he's saying is right. Let's go... Come on. Well done! Madam... Sri Pada, also known as Trikuta. What... are you tired? Ravana's Lanka was marked with a triangle on the map. The triangular shadow of that mountain we see... might be that very triangle. Does that mean Ravana's Lanka was situated there? Eureka! AP was right... Sri Pada answers all prayers. AP, if we find Ravana's Lanka... this would be the fastest archaeological expedition, thanks to you. We'll surely find it. AP is the best guide. Oh my god... Sandra! Sandra! This is selaginella bryopteris. These plants are found only in northern India, not Sri Lanka. This is believed to be what was called 'Sanjeevani Booti' in the 'Ramayan'. No way. Right... this is the first time AP saw this plant in Lanka. I'm sure this is 'Sanjeevani'. If this is 'Sanjeevani'... we're standing in Ravana's Lanka right now. Gayatri? Hello, folks. Long time! I have to say, Aryan... along with being a good professor of History, your wife knows you very well. I didn't want to help them... but I got scared. Sorry. The description of Ravana's Lanka in the manuscript matches that in 'Valmiki Ramayan'. It is proof that Ravana existed... it's a very big literary evidence. When he showed it to me, I knew you would reach here. And you told him where to find us? Yes. Sorry. Sorry but this evidence is with me now and you'll also return that floating rock to me. We don't have the floating rock. Don't play games! There's a civil war going on here... you might disappear without a trace! We're not playing games. We left the rock there when we were escaping from that place. Gabrielle lost the rock. That's why we've come to Sri Lanka, in search of evidence. Isn't it? Last chance. Where is the rock? Oh my god. Don't shoot. -Listen to me... -Move! AP! AP... Are you okay? No! Stop! Stop firing in the chopper. Force the pilot to land. Okay. Land the chopper. Land the chopper right now! Land the chopper right now! Give me that... Gayatri, gun! Gayatri, gun! No... Just stop... We're going down! Caution terrain! We're going to crashland. -Give me that. -Stop! Caution terrain! Caution terrain! Caution terrain! Sit over there. Are you okay? Stop crying now. AP died protecting me. I tried to save him... all I could save was his bag. Why was his bag so heavy? Aryan... Where are you going? Don't go there, Aryan! Floating rock. Help... Aryan, come out right now! Aryan! Come fast. -Aryan! -Run! Aryan, come on. Run. -Aryan, come on. -Run! Aryan! -Aryan! -Aryan, come on. Get out of there. Are you okay? Open the bag. You okay? The rock! Why didn't he tell us? I don't know. If we present this rock and the manuscript to the world... we might be able to prove that Shree Ram existed and that the story of Ram Setu is true. Wait... He took a sample of the Sanjeevani also. We have enough evidence now. But we don't have much time... the final hearing takes place this afternoon. How do we get out here? I can help. I can help. My Lord, Ram Setu Protection Committee has not been able to submit any hard evidence to prove that Ram Setu is a man-made structure built by Shree Ram. I would request the Court to reject this case immediately and not stop the demolition of Ram Setu. That's all, My Lord. Mr. Jagannathan, do you have any evidence? My Lord, I want some more time... My Lord... I have many evidences. Who are you, mister? Aryan, My Lord. Mr. Aryan, I'm sure you're aware that you can be punished for disturbing the court's proceedings. I do. You should have brought your lawyer along. If you don't have a lawyer, the court would have provided you with one. I only want to tell you that I'm an archaeologist who understands the language of rocks, bricks and lost civilizations. My method and language may be different from that of law but My Lord, I believe that the truth... in any language, any form... will still be the truth. He's the same archaeologist who had submitted a report on behalf of the government. Mr. Aryan, the Court permits you to speak. But after hearing what you have to say, if we deem fit, you can be punished for wasting the Court's time. Okay. My Lord, I am an archaeologist who believes in evidence. Till a week ago, I too didn't believe Ram Setu is a man-made structure. But I am forced to change my opinion today. Carbon dating shows that the fossils found on this rock are about seven thousand years old. That means, Ram Setu is seven thousand years old. According to Pushkar Bhatnagar, seven thousand years means... Period of Shree Ram. These corals... have been brought from somewhere else and planted around Ram Setu. They are not native to this site. The question is, who were these people who placed these corals and rocks? Under whose direction? The answer is Shree Ram. My Lord, Pushkar Bhatnagar's evidence cannot be taken as final evidence. If you insist, even if I do agree with Shree Ram's date of birth... how does it prove that the person who built Ram Setu was indeed Shree Ram? I want to ask the government who did the great poets, right from the ancient poet Valmiki to the great poet Tulsidas say the Ram Setu was built by? Ram. Shree Ram! Right from Valmiki... generations of Indian mothers and grandmothers have taught their children that Ram Setu was built by Shree Ram. One understands why Shree Ram is an integral part of India... but why do Nepal, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam hold Shree Ram in such high veneration in their cultural consciousness? Why is 'Ramayan' mentioned in Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism? Why is Shree Ram mentioned numerous times in the 'Guru Granth Sahib'? Why? My Lord, just because a good story has been repeated often does not mean it is true! Over centuries, these stories have travelled with traders and travellers in various countries. What's new about it? I would like to ask the learned ASG madam, all the places described in 'Valmiki Ramayan'... haven't they all been found to exist in India and Sri Lanka? Aren't there 500 such places in India and 50 such places in Sri Lanka? My Lord, no archaeological evidence of Shree Ram and his story has been found in any of these places. In a world where dozens of civilisations have come and gone, where entire countries have disappeared from the map, where some cultures have completely vanished in a matter of few decades, how do you expect one to find archeological evidence of a 7000 year old history? Madam... is a difficult and challenging task. But my Lord, during my exploration in Jaffna, I found a manuscript with the map of Ravana's secret tunnel that was built by Mayasur. My friends and I found the tunnel with the help of the map. My Lord, the map on this manuscript is seven thousand years old and so is the tunnel. The inscriptions found in the tunnel are in the ancient Sri Lankan script of Hela. My Lord, in my opinion, this is the Trikut mountain that is described in 'Ramayan' ...known as Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka. Around this mountain, we found a plant called... Selaginella Bryopteris. This is the closest candidate to what was described as Sanjeevani Booti in 'Ramayan'. Lord Hanuman had taken this plant there from India. It is not native to Sri Lanka. Question is, why is this plant found only around Trikut mountain? My Lord, there is Lanka mentioned in 'Ramayan', Ravana existed in Lanka... why can't we believe Shree Ram existed in Ayodhya? My Lord, what we call Ram Setu is called Adam's Bridge by followers of Christianity and Islam. They believe Adam had crossed this bridge to come to India from Sri Lanka. Tell me, which story will you believe in? My Lord, if Indian Christians and Muslims believe this is Adam's Bridge... is it not an additional reason to save the bridge? But they don't oppose the demolition of this bridge, Your Honor. Will madam ASG tell us who named this bridge Adam's Bridge, and when? No, I am not sure. Let me tell you. My Lord, 220 years ago, in 1788... based on the findings of Australian botanical explorer Joseph Park, the first Surveyor of East India Company, General James Rennel made a map... known as the Map of Hindustan or Map of the Mughal Empire. This map is kept in Thanjavur's Saraswati Mahal Library... The bridge that connects India and Sri Lanka is called Ram Setu in this map. James Rennel changed the name of the bridge from Ram Setu to Adam's Bridge, in the 1804 version of the map. Ram Setu suddenly became Adam's Bridge. This was a ploy by the British to make Indian history Eurocentric. This was a conspiracy to erase Shree Ram's history. The argument on Ram Setu has reached an interesting point in Court. Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha has provided all evidence related to Ram Setu and silenced everyone. My Lord, the government is working on this project keeping all environmental concerns in mind. A very small portion of Ram Setu will be demolished. As far as religious sentiments are concerned... are we not compromising with progress of the nation by considering religious sentiments before every big decission. The Hindu community of our country calls the soil Mother Earth... considers Cow as their mother... Even river Ganges is worshipped as mother. Worships trees, stones and mountains. Tomorrow if a group opposes the construction of a dam on river Ganges saying, we worship the river or opposes an electric pole on a mountain because the mountain is the abode of their Gods... Don't cut down trees as our Gods live on them... Will science and progress ever manage to find a foothold in our country? That's all, My Lord. Mr. Aryan... My Lord, in order to save the symbol of India's defeat, the Qutub Minar, the route of Delhi's metro rail was changed... Because, though a symbol of defeat, it is our historical monument... our heritage. The best example of human craftsmanship... called 'the symbol of love', the unique Taj Mahal... in order to save its beauty from getting ruined, Taj Corridor was stopped. So that the white marble of the Taj Mahal does not get discolored, factories in its vicinity were shut down. My Lord, Taj Mahal is known as the symbol of love across the world, it is our responsibility to try our best to save it from getting ruined. But why is our government so eager to demolish the symbol of the oldest love story... Ram Setu... the symbol of a woman's honor! My Lord, I want to ask you... why were the Lord Buddha statues of Bamyan in Afghanistan bombed? Were the Taliban looking for the stones that the statues were made of... to decorate their homes with? The fact is, the Taliban had a problem with Lord Buddha. As long as the statues were standing there, they couldn't deny the connection between Lord Buddha and Afghanistan... My Lord, why had the world raised their voice against the Taliban at that time? Because Lord Buddha now belonged not just to India, but also to the world. Similarly, demolishing Ram Setu is an attempt to wipe out the memories of Shree Ram. As long as Ram Setu exists, it will show the world... whenever a woman is kidnapped... whenever she is tortured... Shree Ram will emerge to cross the seas with his army of followers and vanquish Ravana! There are thousands of temples dedicated to Shree Ram all over the world But there is only one bridge... Ram Setu! Only people who think like the Taliban would think of demolishing this bridge! My Lord, no archaeologist or scientist will oppose the Sethusamudram Project. All we need to do is find an alternative route. If progress comes at the cost of destroying our culture... it should not be supported by any government or society. This is my prayer... my request to you. That's all, My Lord. This Court will give its verdict shortly. No matter what the Court decides, you're the best lawyer Shree Ram could have. You did very well. All that is fine, professor but if we lose this case today AP and Gabrielle's sacrifice will go in vain. Who was this AP? I don't know... he said he was a guide. I have no idea where he came from. What I don't understand is... despite having the rock with him, why did he take us to Lanka? I wonder why he lied to us. Had he given the rock to you... would you have so easily found all these evidences related to Ramayan? Everything happens for a reason, Aryan. Check his bag, you might find some information on him. Coconut oil. Pen. Yes! Red notebook. He would note down all our travel expenses in this notebook. This might contain some information about his family. I want to send them what we owe him. Aryan! They're about to give the verdict. Come on. Let's go. After hearing both sides, Court has a few questions. Ram Setu or Adam's Bridge that is thousands of years old... is it not a part of Indian and human history and heritage? If it is, who is responsible for saving it? Shree Ram was not just a man, he is part of Indian culture. What kind of a narrative is this in which the government is asking for proof that Ram Setu was built by Shree Ram? Millions of people who believe in Shree Ram are being asked to testify and provide evidence... The Court wants to ask the government... does it have proof that Ram Setu was not built Shree Ram? That Shree Ram is an imaginary figure, the onus of proving it does not lie on people who believe in Shree Ram but on those who don't! Therefore, the Court has decided, until the government provides scientific evidence of Shree Ram not existing in history, they do not have the right to demolish Ram Setu. Jai Shree Ram! Jai Shree Ram! Jai Shree Ram! Jai Shree Ram! Professor, can I get a cup of tea? Of course. Lord Indra looked at the naughty boy and said, 'O son of Anjani, you will be known as Hanuman today onwards'. This is how he got his name Hanuman. Myself Anjaneya Pushpakumaran. You can call me AP. [Hanuman Chalisa] You won't be able to study Ram Setu like this. AP will help you. AP knows Ram Setu like the back of his hand. I'm a guide... your journey is my gain. All I do to help you, I'll write in this diary. [Jai Shree Ram] When I was a child I wanted to fly like a bird. One day, I stretched out my hands and jumped out of the window. I'm sure this is Sanjeevani... Sri Pada is also known as Trikut mountain. You will find Ravana there, as well as Shree Ram. But who was this AP?
