This is the boardwalk of our town. And what you're seeing is the last occasion of the season: the election of Miss Mermaid 1953. Not a bad crowd, is it? Visitors, tourists, and even a movie actress from Rome who's here as pan' of the jury. Everybody's here. And, of course, we're here too: the guys... This is Alberto. This is Leopoldo, the intellectual. And here's Moraldo, the youngest of the bunch. Look at that lightning. It's beautiful. The tenor singing here is Riccardo. As every year, this is pretty much his night. And this is Fausto, our leader and spiritual guide. Do you believe me now? You must think I'm stupid. Give me my shoe. I will, but give me a kiss. - Let go. - Give me a kiss. I said let go. - Stop making a scene! - Let me go, you jerk! The nerve! Listen, you dummy, you promised me... - Promised you what? - That before you left... You poor little thing. People promise a lot of things. - Think what you promised Sandra. - Sandra? Nobody's even heard of her. You don't say! "Nobody's even heard of her." With four out of five votes, the title of Miss Mermaid 1953 goes to Miss Sandra Rubini. My little girl! Just think, you didn't even want to enter. How about that? Your little sister. Go ahead, my dear, go. Miss Mermaid 1953! She's really excited. Attention, ladies and gentlemen. The honors will be done by film star Lilia Landi, here from Rome to present the sash for Miss Mermaid 1953 to our very own local beauty. Looks like the party's over. Say a few words into the mic for your admirers. -I... - Wonderful! She said "I"! Can you bring my cloak? Get a load of that lightning! - I didn't want to compete... - It's just a passing shower. Please remain seated. The party will go on, just a shower. The check, Mr. Alberto. - What check? Everyone's taking off. - At least pay your share. - Introduce me to Lilia Landi. - Not now! There she is. Please. - Thank you, miss. - Certainly. Miss Landi, allow me to introduce of our most esteemed citizens. - Playwright Leopoldo Vannucci. Delighted. An honor to meet you, miss. I've followed your career closely. He's even written a play called Sex. He's also our resident poet. It's beautiful outside, like the end of the world. Congratulations, Sandra, Mrs. Rubini. Now you'll be in the movies. I want you to meet my little girl. My God! Moraldo! - What's wrong, Mama? - Come here! Your sister's sick! Excuse me, please. Get a doctor, quickly! Mama, calm down. It's nothing. - Is there a doctor around? - Yeah. Mancinelli! Here I am. What's happened? Step aside! Let me through! Doctor, my little girl... Here I am. What's happened? Step back! I told you, step back! It's nothing! She just needs some air. - Look at poor Sandra! - It's nothing, Mama. Calm down. - Fausto! Leopoldo, call Fausto! - Fausto! Come here! - Calm down, Mama. It's nothing. - Nothing? Look at her! Pardon me. - Let me through. I'm her friend. - Please, miss. - Leopoldo, what happened? - Sandra fainted, she's ill. Is she better? - Mama. - Darling! What's wrong? I want to die! What are you saying, my pretty little darling? How could you say such a thing when you've just become Miss Mermaid? Don't say that, even as a joke! Doctor, what's wrong with her? Answer me. All right, everyone out! Please. Please. Oh, it's you. Back already? That's why it's raining. What are you up to? Papa, I got to leave now, on business. Remember how I told you someone from Milan had offered me a job? Well, I've thought about it, and I'm going to take it. At this hour? What have you done now? Nothing. I'm taking a job. Aren't you satisfied? What sort of job? They set up a firm. They are very respectable people. By the way, can you lend me 5,000 lire for the train? I'll pay you back when I get there. What have you done now, you scoundrel? What have you done? Nothing. I just got a job. Don't you believe me? I'm catching the 1:00 train. Fausto! You stay here, I'll go see. Good evening, Mr. Francesco. How are you? Evening. Hi, Moraldo. Come in. Come on in. Sit down. Excuse us, Papa. Okay? Some downpour, isn't it? Summer's over, too bad. Wanna smoke? Here. - It's your last one. - Never mind. I don't want it. This will last at least three days. Quite a problem, isn't it? - So you're leaving? - Yeah, I'm heading out. - Will you be gone long? - I don't know... depends. - And Sandra? - She's Miss Mermaid now. She must be happy. Sandra's expecting. Yeah, I know. That's why I'm heading out. Try to understand, Moraldo. I'd like to do right, but how can I? I'm unemployed, like you. I'm broke. That's why I'm going to Milan. I wanna try to start a career. Just till I'm on my feet and I'll come right back. Don't you believe me? I didn't say a word. Look, we understand each other. I really love Sandra. I'll swear by whatever you want, by my own mother. I really love her. It was fate. Be honest. In my shoes, wouldn't you first try to start a career? - I don't know. - You just don't understand. Moraldo, why don't you come with me? We'll go together. What are you gonna do here in winter? - What are you talking about? - If not Milan, we'll go somewhere else. We've always wanted to leave. - Right now? - This is our big chance, I swear! And Sandra will be thrilled, you'll see. Let's go and talk outside. And don't make any noise. Come on. - But Fausto... - Let's go. Turn off the light. Papa! Excuse me, Moraldo. Can I have that 5,000 lire? Why do you want 5,000 lire? - What for, to run off? - No,Papa. You get in trouble and you run. I'll wring your neck. - Papa, please... - Shut up! Come here! What are you gonna do, Papa? I swear I'll - Out of my way! You coward! I swear on the tomb of your poor mother that your rotten escapades are over! That girl's father is an honorable man. Worked all his life, like me, idiot that I am, to support his family honestly. I'll get you into the church if I have to drag you there myself. You're a disgrace! What's going on, Papa? Nothing. Go back to bed. You will marry her. I'll see to it that you do. Hey, Fausto. You fools can laugh all you want, but my father's crying in there. In the end, they got married. It was a lovely wedding, even if a bit hastily arranged. Riccardo sang Schubert's Ave Mafia and brought us all to tears. And the parish priest, who'd known us since childhood, gave a very moving speech. My dear bride and groom, you cannot imagine the joy with which I joined you today in holy matrimony. You, dear Fausto, and you, dear Sandra. See? Quick and painless. Good for you. Soon it'll be your turn too. See, Papa? I'm a married man now. My little girl. Hold it. Stand together for a photo. Alberto, you're standing in front of the bride. Smile. Don't quarrel! Please! Be careful crossing the streets in Rome! Oh, miss. What are you crying for? It's missus now, not miss. - It was nice, wasn't it, Mr. Rubini? - It certainly was. - Riccardo. - I'm coming. - Where to now? - Let's go to Marina. - Congratulations! - Thank you and farewell. Well, Mr. Francesco, I guess this is good-bye. Thanks for everything, Mr. Rubini. You'll see that Fausto's not really a bad kid deep down. I know. This must be your little girl. Your youngest? Yes, she's an angel. It goes without saying that Fausto will live at our home until he can provide for himself and his wife, understood? Good day. Why does she treat him like that? Take us home. Can we buy you a drink, Mr. Francesco? No, thank you, Riccardo. I'm going home. Very well. Good day. - Nine and two makes 11. -11 to 20. You think you won? Leopoldo, write it for me, please. Two points. - Leopoldo, why the long face? - I'm a bit sad. What's the big deal? Just 'cause those two left... - I wonder if they're in Rome yet. - You idealize Rome too much! You got to know your way around Rome to have any real fun. If he'd gone with me, it'd be a different story. A couple of phone calls and we could've had quite a time. And what about Sandra? I meant if he were single. If I were to go on a honeymoon, I'd go to Africa, like Hemingway. Free, in the wild, in a Jeep. Sounds fabulous. Africa would be a real escape. - I'd go there with Esther Williams. - What about Franca Marzi? - Franca Marzi, Ginger Rogers. - Obviously. No! Remember the surveyor's girlfriend? The one who burned her shoulder. - The Ciuffini girl. - Yeah. Africa with her! I'd prefer India. Antonio. Come here. Come on, I called you. You're always in the way. What do you want? You can talk all you like, but he's in Rome and we're stuck in this dirty little town. They make a nice couple, though. They go well together. Nice couple? She's a pretty girl, but not Fausto, with that face! He's tall and well built. - And he has a decent voice. - A voice? So what if he does? We all have voices. Didn't you have any inkling about Fausto and your sister? Let's face it, Fausto didn't treat her right. - He's a scoundrel. - I wouldn't go that far. Fausto isn't a scoundrel. He's a passionate creature - Got a light? Driven by animal instincts. What are you talking about? You think you're writing a play? Fausto's a beast. It's as if one of you had a go at my sister. I'd have a go at her any day! - Pass. - Pass it to me! Give the ball to Nordahl! Alberto, leave her alone. Bastards, it's past your bedtime! In tavern number 20 Who knocks at the doors of these convents? What else is there for us to do? Another day has come to an end. Nothing left but to go home, just as on every night. Alberto lives with his mother and sister, and he knows that Mother won't go to bed until he gets in. Alberta's home. Riccardo, just as on every other night, notices he's gaining weight. Wandering in at this hour! Good night, Papa. Good night, Mama. And Leopoldo, after eating the meal his aunts have left him in his room, prepares to work on his new play. He puts on his favorite record, Vola nella notte, and sits at his table. Removing the cap of his pen, he draws a triangle... and watches his characters parade across the ceiling. Caterina. She's the maid of the renters next door. Hi, Caterina. How's it going? Not so good in this cold. How are you doing? - Okay. I'm working. - Really? What a lovely moon! - As lovely as you. - Liar! Why do you always play that song? It inspires me. And along the deserted streets, just as on every other night, only Moraldo continues strolling. What if I left too? Where are you going this late? It's 3:00 a.m. Aren't you gonna sleep? Sleep? I just got up. I always get up at 3:00 every morning. - Why? - To go to work. - Work? - At the station. Sit down a minute. What do you do? What kind of work? I just told you: I work. - Is this a railroad cap? - Yeah. Tell me, are you happy? It's okay. - Want a smoke? - Sure. I had one here... - Sorry, I'm out. - Never mind. I got to go. Listen... - How's the helmet? - Okay, it fits fine. - Yeah? And will it fly? - Sooner than my enemies would like. So it does fly! Invite me, I wouldn't want to miss seeing you crash! Olga. Olga, could you come out here for a moment? Do me a favor. I'll pay you back Sunday. I'm closing a deal. Lend me 1,000 lire. - So you'll pay me back? - Yeah. You worked all night? He should give you a raise for working like that. It's not right! I'll have a word with him! - I only have 500. - Yes! Thanks, Olga. See you. Good day, gentleman. Massimo and Leopoldo are off to the horse races in Bologna. - How come? - I got an inside tip. Let's place a bet. A thousand would cover it. I've got 300 - how about you? Now the beach is deserted, even on Sundays. But we '0' go there anyway and stare out to sea. If a guy offered you 10,000 lire, would you jump in? I would. - Let's go. - Where? Let's go and watch Giudizio fish. Come on, Riccardo. You know who Leopoldo looks like? The priest! Yes! You're right! Please don't tell Mama you saw me. You said it was over with him. Listen. Let me go! Come on, guys. We shouldn't be staring. So are we gonna go watch Giudizio fish or not? Come on. Hi, Alberto. - Look“. - We keep bumping into each other. I don't want my friends making fun of me on your account. Your friends mocking other people? That's rich. Yeah, and you need to break it off with that crook! What do you expect from him? Nothing. - I don't expect anything. - He's got a wife! - Stop yelling! Mama's sleeping. - He's got a wife! He's married! I know, but they're separated. So what? Is he gonna marry you? - Is he gonna marry you? - Mind your own business, Alberto! I've always taken care of myself. I know what to do. Think you can do as you please because you work? No, you can't! You're my sister! Get your hands off me! If you make Mama cry... Get outta here, Alberto! If you make Mama cry, I'll... Then, one fine day, when we'd almost forgotten about him... Hey, guys! It's Massimo. - Guys! Fausto's back in town. - He's really back? - Yeah, and he's got a mustache! - Where is he? There he is! - Hey, boys! - Fausto, how's it going? - How are you? - Just great, thanks. Hi, Alberto! We've been looking for you for an hour. I've got something amazing to show you. Come over here, guys. - What's that? - It's a phonograph. - We saw Wanda Osiris. - She was wonderful. Sure, it was a nice show, but let's not go overboard. She came down this long staircase... Quiet, quiet. Just listen to this mambo. The best part was that there was a guy dancing like this. - So what? That's not difficult! - So why don't you try it? - Nice, isn't it? - Are you happy? Yes, very happy- Things would've gone on as usual if Fausto's father-in-law hadn't come up with a crazy idea. - Praise our Lord Jesus Christ. - Forever and ever. My good friend, you get younger by the day. How are you? Are you doing well? This must be your son-in-law. Pleased to meet you. Congratulations! Slightly belated, but still sincere! You're a lucky man, you know? That's right. Very lucky. - What's your name? - Fausto Moretti. My dear Fausto, let me be absolutely candid. As you can see, this is my full establishment. - Somewhat small, perhaps... - You call this small? Built through hard work. Frankly, what I really would have needed is a stock boy or a handyman. Someone who can clean up, unload deliveries, open and close the store and climb up the shelves. But all in all, I'd prefer to take you on instead. - Thank the gentleman, Fausto. - Thank you. Don't mention it. In times like these, I'm happy to help a young man who's starting out in life. - Feel right at home. When can you start? - Right now! - Now? - Sure, you can start learning the ropes. Giulia, this is Sandra's husband. From today, he'll be working with us. - It's a pleasure. The truck is here. - I'll be right there. - Shouldn't he buy one of these? - A work coat? For today, I can lend him my spare one. It's right over here. - Best to wear one, or you'll get dirty. - Here we are. Wait, Giulia, please. Try it on. Mama'll make one just for you. Let's have a look at you. Something wrong? It's just been cleaned. Button up and tie the belt. Button up. - Looks like it was tailor-made for him. - Yes. Very nice. Now, young man, you start work. There are crates to unload in the courtyard. Get them unloaded and ask my wife for the shipping log. And keep an eye on the men or they'll break everything. It's fragile stuff. Get going. - There he is. - What's he doing? Isn't he beautiful! - Come on, leave him alone. - Let go. He'll lose his job. How are you? Welcome back. - You look great. - What a pretty hat. - When did you get back? - Yesterday morning. - How does it feel to be called Mrs.? - Where's Fausto? - He's got a job. - He's working? Yes, I'm on my way to pick him up. You're wise to keep an eye on him. Why? Fausto's a good boy. He's just a little fickle. Do you like your new place? We're staying with Mama for now. Of course, you had so little time. Everything was so rushed. You're hardly showing at all. It's still a long way off, isn't it? - Sorry, I've got to run. Bye. - Bye,dean Let's get together, and bring Fausto too. - I came to pick you up. - Terrific! Just a second. Watch this. - How's that? - Bravo! Fausto, what are you doing? Have you gone crazy? We're in public! So? We're married. Do you know what I did today? I sold a statue this tall. - Really? - Yes. Well done! You know what we're gonna do now? We'll go the movies, just you and me. - Great! - Do we have enough money to get in? Yes, I've got it right here. That's my baby. Look, there's a couple of seats over there. Pardon me. Come here. - Do you like it here? - Yes. Can you see? - What a nice refrigerator. - Soon we'll get one too. How adorable. Looking for your cigarettes? Thanks. I've got matches. Know what? Papa really likes you. This morning Mama called me, "Sandra, come here." I went and she then told me Papa is planning an addition to the house. - We must pretend we don't know about it. - Got it. A light, please. Thanks. My pleasure. - That way we can all live together. - What? That way we can all live together. Sure. - Don't believe him, my dear. - You mean I should trust you? I knew he found me irritating. - Terrific, aren't they? - Yeah, really good. Excuse me for a minute. I'll be right back. Hold my seat. - Aren't you feeling well? - No, I'm fine. I'll be right back. Ma'am. Pardon me. Good evening, ma'am. - When can I see you again? - What do you want? - Your phone number. - My number? Get lost. Wait, don't shut the door. I must talk to you. Pardon me a moment. - Are you out of your mind? - I recognize you. Last summer you wore a white bathing suit. Remember, on the boardwalk? So what? I recognize you too. You were in the movie theater with a young lady just now. Not me! When can I see you again? Get out of here. Make no mistakes, I'm a married woman. My maid is upstairs. Give me a date. Tomorrow night? No. Never. - Day after tomorrow? - No. - Then when? - Whenever we meet again. Let's leave it to fate. Good-bye. - No, wait. Don't go yet. - Go away. I have something important to tell you. Come back. Listen. - I've got to speak with you. - Go away! - Sandra, are you still here? - Where were you? I'd forgotten that I'd promised to see a guy off at the train station. Am I late? ls the movie over? Too bad. - How'd it end? Did she die? - No, she didn't. - So what happened? - They got married. What a great actress. Remember that movie we saw in Rome? What was it called? Sandra, are you crying? Yes, you are. What's wrong? I'm scared. Scared? Of what? I don't know. I'm just scared, Fausto. I'm sorry. Don't cry, Sandrina. Don't worry. I'm being silly. I just feel very sad. Sandra, there's no reason. Why? I love you very much. Let me hold your little hand. I feel better now, darling. You know I can't stand to see you cry. I won't cry. As long as you're near me, I won't be afraid. I'll always be near you. - Take me home, Fausto. - Yes, let's go back to our home. In the months that followed, the most important events were that Riccardo, following Fausto, grew a mustache and Alberto grew sideburns. Fausto, on the other hand, had shaved off his mustache. Occasionally his father and sister would pass by the shop to see him at work. Just as on every other night, Leopoldo worked as well. For his part, he grew a goatee. It scares me! I thought you'd like it. And at last, the eagerly awaited carnival season. It'll be a good carnival this year. People seem anxious to celebrate. - Add a beauty spot on the other side. - Nah, one's enough. - Is my dress ready? - Yes. Now leave me alone or your mother will kill me. I still have to do the sheets. - I need bigger breasts. - I padded it in front. Look what he's done to himself, such a good-looking boy. - So, you fancy Alberto, do you? - Don't be so rude. She didn't put in padding. - Alberto, she's in love with you. - Yeah, even Mama's noticed. - Is she really loaded? - Why, do you want to marry her? Elvira, my hat. I don't have your hat. So who's got it? Hold this. Mama. You're still here? I'm ready to go now. I'm not going. Then let me have your hat. Come on. You know I don't wear hats. What am I gonna do? It's like you're doing it on purpose. When you wanna have a good time, no one helps. Look in the trunk. You'll find something, but don't make a mess. What's up? Why's she crying? - Mama, what's wrong? - Nothing. Just a slight headache. It won't end well between you and me. Alberto, come and look. This chest is full of stuff. Just don't make a mess. Your mother will have a fit. Riccardo, I think I've learned the steps. Look at this. Who's the bearded guy? That's my poor old man. Leopoldo, look at these pictures. Here's the hat. - See? I found it. - They're hilarious. - Who is that? - I don't have a clue. What a kook! Look at me. Dreaming of you Look at Alberto! - Shall we dance? - Yes, dear. - Mama, we're going to dance. - Don't overdo it. Ever been up to the rafters in this theater? No, and I have no desire to. Leopoldo, wait for me! We both had the same idea, we're Chinese. Hove you so much. And I love you too. - Why are you squeezing me? - That's the Chinese way. - I'm going to get a drink. - The bar's that way. I was just thinking. One day you'll come to this very theater to see one of my plays. I like variety shows. - What'll you have to drink? - An orangeade. - Antonio, an orangeade. - An orangeade, right away! Ever been up to the rafters in this theater? - Recognize me? - Of course I do! - Here alone? - No, with some girlfriends. Your costume is cute. - Excuse me. - Of course. I made a last-minute decision to come. We'll have a dance later. - Sure. - Yes, you'll see. Gisella, wait! Who's that? A great writer. He's my neighbor, you know. Whiskey, darling? Whiskey? I want a sandwich. A large one. Antonio, a sandwich. Here you are, ma'am. Freshly made. -İsn't this fun? A glass of milk. - Right away, sir. This isn't the time to eat a ham sandwich! - But it's good. - You're always eating. - I'm hungry. - It doesn't look good! Pardon me. What a nice nose! - May I dance with my sister? - Go right ahead. Lose the sandwich! Come on. I'm going to show her the rafters. I'm starving. - Cognac, Giulia? - No. I'm feeling dizzy already. Good evening. Good evening. - Having fun? - Lots. Aren't you? Yeah. Listen, they're playing the Sioux Mambo. - Yes, it's a beautiful song. - May I? - Actually, I'm not alone. - Giulia! Excuse me. - Giulia, listen. - Good evening, sir. Why don't we go to the other buffet? It's packed over here! Excuse me. Two orangeades, Antonio. What's that tormented face about? - Did you see Michele's wife? - No, who? My boss's wife. She's really classy. Just my type, you know? Put it on my tab. I don't think you've got this dance right. I'm a real master at this, right? - What are you staring at? - Nothing. - Where are you taking me? - Come on. - Look, it's breathtaking. - It makes me dizzy. - Then don't look down. - Now what? Nothing. Tomorrow I'll take you for a drive. - I'm not going. - Of course you are. One more kiss on that lovely neck. - Please. - You're so annoying. Stop, stop now. Get out of here with that damn trumpet! Come with me, you thick-head. Anita, come on. Let's go to mass. Why won't you believe me? Alberto, what's wrong? Feeling sick? I'm okay. - Come on, I'll take you home. - I'm okay. - Get out of here. - Moraldo. - Get out of here. - I'll take you home. Go to Peking, why don't you. - Moraldo, leave him alone. - I can't. He's a friend of mine. Let me go. - Come on, let's go home. - Let me go. I'm okay. - Hey, let's go swimming. - Yeah, but home first. - Okay, home first. - And then we go swimming. - Then we go swimming. - We'll all go together. - Who the hell are you? - Moraldo. - Who? - Moraldo. No, you're nobody. You're all nobodies. All of you. What do you think you're doing? - Nothing, nothing. - Let me go. You make me puke. But, Alberto, if I let you go... - Let me go. I wanna go by myself. - Alberto, you'll get hurt. I want to go alone. I'll be okay. You're nobody. - Alberto, look out, you'll fall. - You make me puke. - Moraldo, please, let's go. - I can't just leave him. - May I come along now? - Yeah, sure. Come on, come on. - What do you want with me? - Nothing. Just keep walking. Moraldo, know what? - We got to get married. - Yes. We got to get married. Did you see Fausto? Nice and calm. He's settled down. He's happy. He has a house. We just got to... - Hey, Alberto! - Who's that? You got to get married, Riccardo. - You just got to. - Okay, bye. See, I told him too. You know what we'll do instead? We'll leave. We'll go to Brazil. Can you imagine that? We'll take her along, too. - Yeah, right. - Brazil. By steamboat. - I'm not gonna fall over. - But first we go home. - We're off to Brazil. - You gonna leave me here? I can't just leave him. You come too. Alberto, you're home. Do you want me to take you in? I don't wanna go home. What's there for me? I've been waiting for you. I wanted to say good-bye. I'm leaving, Alberto. Forgive me. I just couldn't take it here anymore. Take care of Mama. I'll always think of you. Good-bye. Bye, Alberto. Try to be sensible, Alberto. Olga, where are you going? Where's she going? Mama, what's going on? You can see. She's gone. I never would have expected this from my own daughter! After all that I've sacrificed. Don't cry, Mama. Don't. I'll stay. I'll always be here. But she'll come home, you'll see. And if she doesn't, better yet! What does she think, that we really needed her four pennies? Good riddance! I'll get a job. - Really, Alberto? You will? - Of course. Have you found something? - Have you found something? - No. END OF PART ONE PART TWO - Good morning. - See what that lady wants. - What lady? - That lady over there. Hello. May I help you? I'd like two candles, the kind I bought last year. I wasn't here last year. She wants the same candles she bought last year. So get them for her. They're in the stockroom. - Sir. - Excuse me. Did you enjoy yourself last night? Try to get here earlier. It's 11:00. We open at 9:00. My friend's sister ran away. Someone runs away every night. You always have an excuse. - And I have a toothache. - Get to work. Giulia, go and see what he's done in there. Pardon me. But just look at this craftsmanship. - What happened? - They fell. Please, I'll take care of it. I'm sorry. - What was that for? - Just paying you back. Carnival is over, I believe. Mrs. Giulia, you should always wear what you did last night. Hand me the receipts in that drawer. - Which drawer? - That drawer under the counter. - The receipts you requested. - Thank you. What are you doing? I got no sleep last night. I waltzed with you in my dreams, all night long. - Put away these books, please. - Give me a hand. Never mind. I'll do it myself. How passionate! Only last night did I realize you're a real woman. You must be drunk! Yes, drunk with you, your flesh, your scent. Stop acting foolish! Why? You'd have me believe you don't like it? I don't. Take that. Please keep quiet about this. It's sunny, but quite chilly. Hello. Could I take a look at some angel ornaments? - Good night, sir. I'll go out this way. - Wait a minute. Why not come up and have a drink with us? Today's our anniversary. Fifteen years. Congratulations, but I wouldn't want to intrude. On the contrary. We'd love it. If I'd known, I would've brought flowers or something. Nonsense. We live upstairs. It's very convenient. - After you. - Thank you, you're very kind. Follow me. Make yourself at home. Come right in. Giulia, please bring some vermouth. - Giulia, the vermouth. - Yes, Michele. Have a seat. - It's lovely. - You like it? - Really lovely. - Modest, but I like it. I'm about to set up my place too, you know? - Is that so? - Is that boat a real antique vessel? Yes. Here's the vermouth. Thank you. Evening, ma'am. Congratulations. I hear it's your - Thank you. I've got to finish. Go ahead, dear. Go ahead. My wife's a good woman, no? Yes, very good, and... And what? A good woman. Ah, yes. We're not so young, but we still get along well. Since we have few friends, we spend most evenings at home, right here in this room. - Sometimes we play cards. - That's enough. Thanks. You'll probably find that amusing. It may seem odd that we play cards, but we do. Sometimes I read while my wife knits. But we're not bored, and do you know why? Because we really love each other. - But you wouldn't understand. - Of course I understand. No, you don't. - But I really do. - No, you don't. I really Pity YOU- And I pity your poor wife even more. - What do you mean? - What do I mean? Here you go. Here's your monthly salary. Make up an excuse for your family. Say you didn't like it. Too much work. Tell them whatever you want. You're good at coming up with excuses. But why are you firing me? To teach you how to live. I welcomed you like a brother and you acted like a scoundrel! Now get out of here as I really feel like punching you. I never would have expected this from you. No, leave her out of this. Giulia, Fausto's going. He won't be working for us any longer. He just quit. - So I shouldn't come in tomorrow? - No. Good evening. I was only kidding around, ma'am. I lost my job... because of that silly woman, my boss's wife. Who's that? She'd fallen in love with me, but out of respect for Michele, I turned her down. She's an old lady. How could I fall for her? So she turned her husband against me. And today he made up an excuse to fire me. - What excuse? - Huh? - He just can't do that. It's way too easy. - He can and did. Can you believe that he said, "Use any excuse you like for your family." Now it's up to me to make up an excuse. That's absurd. You shouldn't have left. And no severance at all, nothing? He should have given you notice - a month at least. No, no notice. A month at least. He can't just cheat you out of 30,000 lire. One can't just do that today. You work. You've got a job. Isn't the water delicious? Not drinking? Aren't you thirsty? Moraldo, can you keep a secret? I don't know. Why? My boss should've given me notice, right? So I'm gonna get what's mine, and we'll split it. I don't understand. - Would you climb up onto a roof with me? - What roof? You'll see. - I'm not sure. What are we gonna do? - You scared? - No. - Then let's go. Let's go. - Quiet. - No, out of the way. - Where are we? - Quiet. Stop talking. This is the courtyard. Be careful with the matches. There's lots of hay in here. - Where are you? - Over here. Come here. What are you doing? - Beautiful, isn't it? - What is it? An angel. Now we've got to get it out. You know how much it's worth? At least 40,000 lire. I saw the bill. It's an antique. You intend to steal it? - Let's get out of here, Fausto! - It's not theft. When they unloaded it, it was left here and nobody noticed for two months. And you said I should've been given notice. - I wasn't, so we'll take this instead. - But this is theft. Listen, Moraldo, I have a family now. I need this money. I've got a lot of things to take care of. If you're scared, I'll go it alone. At least give me some light here. Look how beautiful it is. Beautiful. - Tell him to be quiet. - Giudizio, cut it out! Good morning, Sister. ls the Mother Superior in? Why? I'd like to discuss some business I think she'd find in her interest. What is it? Mother Superior's in the chapel now. Fausto, let's go. No, Moraldo, show her. Look at this beauty. Show her. An angel, solid wood. It was in our house, but we're forced to sell. So we thought the Ursuline Convent could have it for a reasonable price. Just look at that expression. Beautiful angel, beautiful angel! Don't be afraid. He's a simpleton, but harmless. We already have enough angels. Sorry. Sister, listen. A brother, way up! What do you want? How are you today? Would you like a cigarette? Wait a moment. Here, catch. Terrific. It's lovely here. This is the life. - What's your name? - Father Felice. - Is the Father Superior in? - No. - So who's in charge in his absence? - I am. Wonderful. We have a real bargain for you. A magnificent statue. Colorful, perfect for the altar. - Is that it? - Yes. Show it to him. Beautiful angel, beautiful angel! Isn't it beautiful? Look how expressive. Where did you get it? It's from our house, but we've got no place for it. We thought it would look better in your cloister. We have no need for it here. They were unable to sell the statue that day. So that evening, Fausto and Moraldo entrusted it to Giudizio with a thousand instructions. Here's Papa. Good evening, Papa. Moraldo, come here. Don't make me come after you! - Papa, what did I do? - You really have to ask? Hoodlum! Cheat! Wait till I get hold of you! I haven't done anything. What's the matter? What's the poor boy done? Poor boy! He's a monster! We're all disgraced! Thieves! Get out! Both of you! - What did they do? - They stole a statue! - That's not true, Papa. - Of course it is! Shut up! He stole it together with this fine specimen here. I had to beg the police not to arrest you in my home. Yes, the police, in my own home! And this pig tried to force himself on the wife of my dearest friend. What a disgrace! They told you a pack of lies! I'm shocked you believed them! - Very shocked! - And you dare to raise your voice? Yes, I do! You treat me like a five-year old! I'm 30! Keep your crummy food! You'll never see me again! Never! It wasn't his fault. Giulia tried to seduce him, then lied to her husband. Sandra, are you listening to me? - Really? - Yes, it was her. Because Fausto never encouraged her. Because Fausto wouldn't even look at her. And then they wouldn't pay him. So we took the statue. - So he really didn't encourage her? - I swear. Now stop crying- - Where is he now? - Out in the garden. I'm waiting for Moraldo before leaving. Tell Papa he'll never see me again. I don't want to be a burden. What are you saying? Moraldo told me everything. What do you mean? Don't worry, I'll tell Papa... that that woman flirted with you. - Let's forget about it. - No, they have to know the truth. Here, your cutlet. You haven't eaten a thing. Damn it! Why did you take the statue? Did you need money? You should have told me, Fausto. Why didn't you? There should be no secrets between us. We have to cling to each other. All we have is each other. Mama is very kind... but she treats me like a baby. And Papa is always so busy. He doesn't even know me. You're all I have, Fausto. If you leave too... Sandflna. Don't cry. - Do you still love me, Fausto? - Yes. - Do you love our baby? - My Sandrina, our baby. So will you stay with me? Yes. Then come on home. Let's go talk to Papa. Come. So Fausto was forgiven and started leisurely looking for another job. They didn't pay him much attention at home once the baby was born. A Q0rgeous baby! He looked just like Mama, Papa, the aunts, the grandparents and even Moraldo. He looks like my math teacher. He's so ugly! Sandra was happy. And one day, almost secretly, she took the baby to meet her father-in-law. - The coffee is almost ready. - Good girl. Moraldino, why are you so fat? Yesterday he said "blue." I wonder what he meant. Has Fausto found a job? I guess so. He should start in a matter of days. Excuse me, Papa. I'll see about the coffee. - No, I'll go. - Please, let me go. Sandra, can I hold him? Be careful with him, Mirella. Don't drop him. Come on, Moraldino, give your auntie a kiss. Come, give him to Grandpa. No, Papa, you don't know how to hold him. That's no way to hold a baby. I don't know that one. - Is that the farthest? - Yes, it's called Sirius. - Are there people living there? - I don't think so. - Would you live there? - Yes. - I don't believe you. - Sure I would. - Will you walk with me? - Sure. The evenings were getting warmer. Spring was in the air. And now, a man whose heart is as great as his name. That's him. He's brilliant. Listen. Mr. Sergio Na tali. That's him. You'll see. I shall recite Reminiscence of Youth. - Is that Natali? - Yes. He's uglier than sin. Grandpa, when is Papa coming home? Little one, your papa has already returned. He's here, lost in the crowd. He's watching you, smiling at you. He just brushed by you. And you, little one, didn't feel a thing. Why not, Grandpa? Because you're innocent. Your papa left in the spring, just like your grandpa. As a lieutenant, amid flowers, songs and a flag. Leopoldo has long awaited this evening. The great actor has read his play and will see him in his dressing room after the performance. His big moment has arrived. Even we grasped the importance of this meeting, and we were as excited as Leopoldo. Ah, I see you've brought company. Please, come in. Please, come in. - Bring some chairs. - That's all right, sir. We'll stand. Forgive the candle. In these second-rate provincial theaters, they always steal the light bulbs. - Of course, sir. It's nothing. - May I offer you a cigarette? They're domestic, you know. American cigarettes are very bad for you. - Sir, I'm a great admirer. - I saw you in "I due Foscari". Yes, well, the best parts were left on the cutting room floor. Please, have a seat while I finish removing my makeup. Sir, I've admired you for years. I saw you for the first time in Bologna, in 1943. It was an unforgettable evening. You revealed Ibsen to me. Ibsen. Those were the days. Feels like yesterday. Being principal actor is hard work, my friend. And you're seeing me during a break, a vacation, I'd like to call it. - It's temporary, of course. - Fausto, look who's here. Let me tell you, I have great ideas for next season. I want to put together an amazing cast. A cast that will make history. I might be able to get Ferrati, and perhaps even Gassman. Did you hear that? He's gonna get Ferrati and Gassman. I want young playwrights, both for the grants and for the challenge. By the way, I read your piece. Skimmed it, really. You understand, I'm always so busy. The theater is a tyrant. But you've got it. You really liked it? You've got it here... and here. Sir. "I'm a product of my time. I am, alas, powerless. Do you understand, Frida, the writhing agony of my soul?" Frida laughs. "I understand, Roberto, that you are consumed by pride..." - Salt. -"...by your being." Roberto laughs. "What more damage can pride do to a soul already ruined? Blind man! Only fear could save you." Blind man! Only fear could save you. Brilliant! But that was Frida's line. She goes on. "In the silence of your desert, don't you hear a voice calling you?" Robert, ironic: "Your voice, Frida?" "No... the voice of God." So ends Act ll. Beautiful. Don't you think it's good? - I like it. - May I start Act Ill? - Go on. - Act III, Scene I. - The door! - I'll close it. - Waiter, what have you got? - Anything you want. - Is the food good here, sir? - May I continue? Delicious, thank you. - Of course, read on. - Act Ill, Scene i. The scene is the same. Miss, do you want to choose from the menu? What's the omelet Romagnola? The one with all that grease? - Moraldo. - No, it's béchamel. All right, I'll have that. Ask Mr. Natali to introduce us. Why not? - And after beans, please bring me... - Frida's opposing thoughts will be represented by two figures clad in white. Special effects with black lights will give the scene a nightmarish quality. The wind from time to time will carry in the cry of the gulls. As if shaken by a sudden shiver, Frida turns. She looks tired, aged. She approaches Luca. "There will be no moon tonight." I like you, baby. And if you're not drinking with me, damn you to hell! - Can you do Gary Cooper? - Alberto, do the saw. I do a good saw. But you've got to close your eyes. Be quiet and listen! My turn to do an impression. - My grandmother. - Granny, I'll never leave you. Can't you do impressions? Why are you so serious? I like this dark-haired boy. He's got class. That's true. "No, not even crime horrifies me now. Yet I can remember..." Hey, there's a radio here. I'm gonna turn it on. That's a naughty thing to say. Leopoldo, where are you going? I'll tell you later. I feel poetically inspired. An idea worthy of a genius! An ocean breeze, a night wind. - Sir, my friends... - Your friends have disappointed me. He who cares not for art cares not for life. - Is the beach that way? - Yes, sir. Excellent! Let's use first names - we're both artists, after all! Your Frida is wonderful. She's marvelous. What a well-sculpted character. Perfect for Ferrati! Excellent! I'll write to her tonight. And she will accept for sure. If Act IV is anything like the first two you read me, I can tell you we have a guaranteed success on our hands. - What's your name? - Poldo, sir. Leopoldo, in two months you must come with me to Milan. - Really, sir? Are you serious? - Call me Sergio. - Sir, are you serious? - Come, let's read Act IV. Sir, you have no idea what this means to me. I was ready to give up on all my childhood dreams and hopes. - Is the beach this way? - This way, sir. Sergio, I can hardly express... This town is blind to art. It's so hard, being perpetually misunderstood. My friends don't even understand me. They only care about material things. They live their sordid lives, thinking of women and money. I feel so alone. And the winter is awful. It's endless in this town. I'm so full of sadness and anguish. At midnight the town goes dark. How can an artist feed his demons? How can he live in this silence? The years go by, then one morning you wake up. Just yesterday you were a boy, and now you're no longer young. My hat! But that's all over now. In two months I'll go to Milan, Genoa, anywhere. I knew I shouldn't give up. I knew I'd find my way, that one day you'd come along. Where are you? The wind has died down. Is that the pier? Come and read me Act IV. Sir - Sergio, where are you going? We'll find a spot down there. But it's dark down there. Come. Come. You aren't afraid of me, are you? Poldo, where are you going? I was joking. What did you think I meant? Come back here, Poldo! Bye. Bye,baby. Don't catch cold. I'll come to the station in the morning to see you off. What are you doing here? - I was waiting for you. - Good for you. Thanks. I think it's better if we go home together. Of course. Man, what a woman! You know what she told me? If I could sing, she'd cast me. Honest. She was going to take me on tour. That wouldn't be a bad life, you know? You travel, you're free, you have fun, no worries. Always surrounded by women. Oh, how good it used to be What about you? What about me? Nothing. Why not? She really wasn't bad-looking. What's wrong with you? Nothing. I was just thinking. About what? Sandra. What's she got to do with this? You gonna preach to me now? Is that why you waited for me? Answer me. Good night. You've still got lipstick on your face. Other side. Sandra, aren't you asleep yet? - Look at that little face. - Don't touch him! Why not? - Are you crying? - Go away. - What did I do? - Go away. Sandflna. - Don't touch me. - You'll wake the baby. Tell me what I did, at least. That morning, Sandra left the house at dawn without a word to anyone, and at noon she still hadn't come back. Here comes Riccardo with Papa's car. Hi, Riccardo. Hi, Alberto. Get in, Fausto. Hi, Fausto. Moraldo went to see Miss Rossi, Sandra's old teacher. - She might have gone to see her. - That's right, Fausto. I think she might be there. Let's go to the school and then to her nanny's. How far to the nanny's? What about the gas? What happened? Did you have a fight? - Well? - She hasn't seen her. Get in. Let's go to the nanny's. You go ahead. I'll look for her on my own. - What's happened to her? - Nothing, miss. Forget about him. Let's go. Leopoldo, how about before we leave town we grab a bite to eat? We could grab a bite to eat before we leave town. Shut up! I think we'll find her at the nanny's. I'm sure of it. She went to show her the baby. You'll see. That's what I think. She went to show her the baby. Did you have anything to eat before you left the house? - Nothing at all? - I'm not hungry. - A sandwich, maybe... - I'm not hungry! - Where are we supposed to turn? - Let's get out. - Let's ask for directions. - Ask who? There's nobody here. - There's a house down there. - There's no one there. This is a wasteland. Fausto, where are you going? - Watch Leopoldo. - Go ahead, do it. - Hey, you could have hit me. - Don't look at me. It was him. Quiet. Did you hear the pipit? - What? - The pipit. That's no pipit. That's a robin. That's no robin. Robins sound like this... How do robins sound? Robins sound like this... But Sandra wasn't at the nanny's either. Fausto was getting scared. - What happened? - Riccardo. - We have to go back right away. - The car won't start. We'll have to take the carburetor apart. - May I borrow that bicycle? - Of course, dear boy. It belongs to Cesare, but he won't need it today. Be careful. Something to eat? An omelet with bacon, maybe. - Wait. Where are you going? - Get out of my way. Listen, Fausto. Sandra is at home. I'm sure of it. I'll bet you anything that she's at home. Cut it out. Out of my way. Now you feel guilty? It took you long enough. Out of my way, idiot! Worry about that sister of yours who never came back! Dirty rotten coward! Lecher! - You mentioned an omelet? - Yes. - With bacon. Albertone. - Leave me alone. - With bacon. - With bacon? -İsn't anybody home? - They're at the police station. They're looking for her at the beach. At the beach? Why would they do that? I don't know. What should I do? Should I start making lunch? It's you. See? We meet again. It's fate. What's the matter? Why haven't you shaved? Where are you going in such a hurry? The movies? I'm going home. Would you be a gentleman and carry this for me? I'm sorry. Forgive me. I really can't. Is she back? If she doesn't come back, I'll kill myself! You'll never kill yourself. You're a coward. Moraldo, listen. Mr. Michele. What's the matter? Sandrina has disappeared. Hey, workers. Stupid workers! - What's up with this car? - Hey, why are you stopping? - Get out. Open the hood. - What do you want me to do? Let me out. - Look at him. He's asleep. - Hurry up. They're coming. Oh, boy! Hey, we were only joking! What's going on? - Try that again, if you dare! - What did I do? I was asleep. - I'm a socialist. - Socialist? You're not even a man! - Are you looking for Sandra? - Yes. She's been here with us all day. Hold it right there. Sandra, take the baby in the other room. - Papa, it's all right. - Please, go in the other room. Go ahead. - You too, Mirella. - Please, Papa, let me stay. Go ahead, be good. What a day, Papa. Papa, what are you doing? - You hear that? - No, I can't hear a thing. He's beating him! Let me go in there! They're just arguing. A little loudly, but they're men. He's hurting him. Please, Papa! Leave them alone. They're just playing. No,Papa,no! Let me go in there. Can't you hear them yelling? - Don't worry, it's nothing. - Mirellina, he'll kill him. - So you're trying to kill me? - That's enough, Papa! - He's beating him to a pulp. - I don't think he's hurting him. On the contrary... You poor little thing. Please hold the baby. I have to go in there. Papa,enough! Hold him. Allow me to shake your hand. Michele Cam's the name. It's an honor. You really gave me a scare. - Did he hurt you, darling? - No. How are you? Good night, Papa. You scared me so, Sandra. Never do that again, you hear? And if you make me mad again, I'll beat you like your father. But even harder. I'll beat you senseless. That's how I like you! Let me hold the baby. - Don't let him catch cold. - Look, Mirellina is at the window. Bye, Mirella. Fausto and Sandra's story ends here for now. As for Leopoldo, Alberto, Riccardo and the rest of us, you can imagine what happened. We all talked about leaving, but only one of us, one morning, without saying a word to anyone, actually left. - Are you leaving? - Guido. - Yes, I'm leaving. - Where are you going? I don't know. I'm leaving. All aboard. All clear. - Why are you leaving then? - I don't know. I have to go away. I'm leaving. Didn't you like it here? Good-bye, Moraldo. Good-bye, Guido. THE END
