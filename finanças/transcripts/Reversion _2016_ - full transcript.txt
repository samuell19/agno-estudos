So relax, alright and let's just let this thing play itself out. George Barker, Steve, Maggie, Cathy McAdams Four other names, four other names. Stop the car! Open the door! Open it! Drive. Drive! I'm going. It's not for you. No, wait! Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds, George Barker, Steve, Maggie, and Cathy McAdams... This is bullshit, man. Shh! You hear that? No, I don't hear that. What are you talking about? Shh! The Manhunt for the man who assassinated the President continues. Police departments from 3 states, along with the Secret Service, the FBI, and the NSA are working together to bring the man who murdered America's President to justice. The city is on lockdown: All bus and train stations have doubled their security. Road blocks have been setup across all bridges and tunnels. All outgoing flights have been terminated. I'm standing by with David Corinth, head of the Secret Service. Mr. Corinth, the country is looking for answers. Could you tell us, how one man could infiltrate the White House, take out all its security and the Secret Service, then murder our Commander and Chief? Well, the man must've been highly trained. He was a Marine, 8 years, highly decorated, for multiple acts of bravery. But we believe he might have received additional training, maybe in the Middle East. Our investigation is still ongoing but it seems like he was working alone. But right now that's just speculation. One thing we do know is that he is a highly trained assassin. We've identified the suspect as Luke King, a former Marine from the special forces division. King was honorably discharged over 6 months ago. If you see Luke King do not approach him, contact the authorities. This suspect is considered armed and extremely dangerous. I don't know man, that looks a lot like you. Somebody set me up. I'm gonna find out who. So the press got it wrong? No the press is telling it wrong. The person who killed the President that looks like me, but that's not me. You got a twin brother you don't know about? No. Okay, then who the hell else could it be? A Clone. What? That's a clone. That's a clone. Clone. You might want to think up a better storyline than that for your defense. It's original. I'll give you that. But it's a little too over the top for the jury. You serious? There are things going on in this world that you wouldn't possibly believe, or understand. And I believe private corporations are more than capable to make a clone of a person. I don't know man. I think you're reaching. All those tests. The pills. What were they doing? Hey, you are gonna get that kid killed and for no reason. If you let him go now, I'll keep him out of it. Who is this? Tell the kid to pull the car over. Now. You the one who tried to kill me? You're making this way more difficult than it has to be. Why are you chasing me? You run, I chase you. It's what I do. Run as long as you want, there's no where you can go to get away from me. What the hell do you want from me? End your communications on the grid. And give us your source. You think I'm stupid? That's the only thing keeping me alive. I know everything. I've got enough evidence to bury you, the men you work for, and your whole freaking organization. You don't know anything. You're just a rabid dog that needs to be put down. If anything happens to me, the public learns everything the next day. You may think you're in control, but you're not. It's time to end this game. That's funny, I just get in the game and now you want to end it. Let's not. Let's keep going and see where things end. Aye, it's me. Listen, I know you're seeing a lot of crazy stuff about me on the news. Don't believe it, alright. We need to meet. Alone. Remember the place that I went whenever my Mom kicked me out because I got suspended from school? Meet me there, ASAP. Give me your phone. What? What the fuck man! Shut up! In this exclusive world news report you will see how one of today's top mathematician... Hey, man. Hey, could we loosen the cuffs a bit? Hey. Hey, man! My wrists are killing me. Can you loosen the cuffs, please? Please, my wrists are killing me. Can you loosen the cuffs, man? Hey man, come on. Loosen the cuffs please, come on. Thank you. Oh that's better. God. Come here. What? Yeah. Are you? Are you serious? That's the best its gonna get. Are you serious? What the hell man? How is this better? At least tell me what we're waiting for? A friend. I need someone I know, to know that I'm not a killer. When you talk to your friend, you gonna stick with this clone story? It's not a story, alright? I, I try to focus to try to remember. But I can't. Maybe you should get back on your medication. It's like, they grab a hold of your mind. And they rip it out of you. Then they put something else back in. But you don't know what it is. But it's there. It's in there. Do you hear voices? No. It's not like that. It's like a... It's like a... It's like a black hole and it's deep. You can't see it. But you know it's in there. Maybe it will be easier if you can accept your reality. No, never. This isn't my reality. Reality is what you make it. Just be quiet. Cheers. I don't know what to think, man. And that's why I brought everybody over here so we can kinda talk about it. Yo. Whatsupp brothers. Good to see you, man. What's happening? We all know why we're here, hoo? Hoo! And we believe what they say on television? Smith had some sort of psychotic break then went on a rampage and killed 10 people at a farmer's market. Na, man. I ain't buying that. Na, that's bullshit. Ever since we got back, everyone has been falling apart. You officers think about those doctors? Naa. Doctors? You aren't calling that. They're more like scientists. Those clips... that they showed us. Those questions. Yeah, I think they used us as guinea pigs. No. No, wait, wait! We're speaking to Marine Sergeant William Copeland, who was station with Luke King in Afghanistan. "You were is Squad Leader weren't you?" "Yeah, sir. He was a good soldier. He saved my life. And I wasn't the only one. I'd kept in contact with some of the guys when we got back state side.. And they told me he was having problems adjusting. I don't know man... I wish I would've reached out to him more. You know what I mean?" "Do you believe he killed the President?" "King can get pretty angry sometimes. I mean, he was disappointed with the government to say the least. He didn't feel like they were being transparent or honest enough, you know? He really thought, they were poisoning him. Stopped eating meat. Stopped eating fish. He wouldn't eat anything that was processed. But then he stopped watching TV and, and... started not wanting to listen to the radio. He thought that they were in his head in some kind of way. He wanted to get them out of his thoughts. And stop them from controlling his thoughts, I don't know. He would get depressed about it. Sometimes, the guys said that he would sit in his room for days at a time just let the candles burn. I don't know. He was crazy sometimes, I can't lie. But could he have killed the President? Luke? Luke was a good man. He was my friend. A brave soldier. And if he put his mind to it, he could do anything. And if he thought like he had a good reason for doing it? He could do it in his sub-conscious, no question. So yes, I think he did it. I think he did kill the President." He has family in Virginia? He hasn't spoken to them since he was discharged from the military. His parents are both retired. His father, a former bus driver, his mother, a high school teacher. He was a troubled child and spent his teen years in and out of juvenile detention center. Until he joined the marines at age 20 to avoid jail time. He was a model soldier during his tour with the marines. But Doctors say after he was discharged and returned home, he began to show signs of PTSD, and had bouts of anger and paranoia. Doctors had prescribed medication, but he might not be taking it. If he's not, he could become extremely violent and hostile. If you see Luke King, don't approach him, stay away and alert the authorities. Is all that stuff true? Most of it. Must suck having your whole life on display to the whole world like that. Doesn't matter if everyone thinks you're dead anyway? You could just disappear, and start over. Because I want to be me that's why. They took everything from me. I can't even go back to see my family or my friends. I might as well be dead. Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds, George Barker, Steve, Maggie, and Cathy McAdams, four other names. The other day in the car. Did you have proof that it wasn't you? That you can bring them all down. What's the proof? That's not even important right now. What's important right now What's important right now is that we play this thing on and that means we wait. But you could use that information to clear your name. Why are you just waiting here? Why don't you be proactive? Once it's in the public, you'll be safe. What's the proof? What do you have on them? Kid for your own good. It's best if you don't know right now. Ya'll remember Ghazni? Ghanzi? Sending us out on recon without proper equipment and then we get hit by a dirty bomb. That's bullshit. Dumars died a slow death on that one. How many of you are still taking that medication every morning? Isn't it to useful for those chemical attacks? That's what they say. What if it's not? Sometimes I have been having these dreams. Argh, man. It's like we're killin' people. We all do that. I know, but it wasn't in the East. It was here. What? Here. Out in West. I know. Hey, who say the game last night? Get up. Shit's getting old man. You hear me, this shit's getting old. Get up. A Missing Persons Alert has been issued for Jerry Wilson, a 24 year old college student from the LA area. He drives a white Forrester and was last seen downtown, where traffic cameras spotted him on the corner of 9th and Broadway. His parents are offering a $50,000 reward for anyone able to supply information that leads to his discovery. If you have any information about Jerry Wilson or his whereabouts call the number listed on the screen. Did you see that? You see, They're looking for me. I'd be very worried if I were you. What? Why? They put you on the TV. This is a Nation wide broadcast announcing a search for you. Yeah, that's great. They never mentioned me. What do you think is gonna happen to you when the guys that are looking for me find you? Then let me go and get back on your meds. Or get back on your meds and let me go. You still don't get it do you? These people were able to make a clone of me, some super clone and then kill the President with it. You don't think they're above manipulating the media to help them find us and then kill us. Open your eyes kid, even if I let you go, you'll end up dead. Just... Just sit tight. Hello. You are a dead man. Mr. Garnerson you have to understand You are a dead man. Mr. Gandersund. You talked, didn't you? I did not talk sir. I did not talk. I'm still enrolled in the program. Tell me the truth soldier. On my word sir, on my word. I'm still the prof... Hello. Baby, listen. You gotta get the kids. Take them to mom's. Why what's the matter? They know? how? I don't know, I don't know. They just know, they know. Take the kids, I'll meet you when I can. Oh my God. Oh my God. Hello? No, no. Please, please, no, no, no! After months of speculation Archdiocese of Philadelphia and its 16 member blue ribbon committee has called for the closing of 10 Catholic schools, including Roman high school. The closings are the result of falling enrollments and the opening of many charter schools in the area. In politics today, the race for the GOP... What the hell took you so long? I was being followed and I lost it. What's going on, huh? Everything's upside down, alright. I'm still trying to put things together. You need to talk to your boy. He's got issues. Who's this? The guy who wants to go home. I needed a ride, alright? He was at the right place, right time. Wrong place, wrong time. I just want to get the hell out of here. Tell your friend to let me go. Are you serious? You got a hostage? I didn't plan for it like that, it just turned out that way. What the hell is going on, Luke? Is it true, did you kill him? No, I didn't kill him. Have I killed people, Yes, but I didn't do this, all right, you got to believe me, man. Put that away. And if you're a surfer, you'll like this story, big waves expected to pound the Southern California coastline in San Diego today and tomorrow. Waves could be breaking more than 10 feet... Can you turn this down? That is just adding to your stress. This is KNX Newsradio. Luke, I believe you bro. I do. Wait, wait, wait. You believe him? I believe whatever you you think you're thinking is real. What if it's not? Have you been taking the pills? What if I told you there were cops outside? Are you serious? No. But what if I was? Would you give up? Nope. Too many people have died for this. Their families need to know the truth. What truth? That their family members weren't killed by accident. They were killed on purpose by the US government to allow the enemy to move forward with the biggest conspiracy in US history. I'm not the one to kill the President. Who is this enemy you keep talking about? Shhhh! Did you hear that? Hear what? You should get out of here, the cops... Part of this is my fault, I should've spotted the signs and known something was wrong. I was on my way to see Freddie, okay? We've been putting things together. The Doctor, the tests, all those pills and injections. They were experimenting on us. I was on my way to Washington, the bus stopped at a Rest Area. I had an episode in the restroom. I lost time. After it was over, the bus was gone. So I went off the grid. Three days later I learn about the assassination. I watched them tell the world that it was me. But its a damn lie. I have no doubts that you believe this. But you have to see things from my point of view, what are the facts? You're the one running. You're the one everybody's looking for. If you're not the one who killed the President then who did? It was a clone! They made a clone of me! Why won't you believe me? You know what? Regardless of what you think, I think the doctors took samples of our DNA and they're making clones with them. Cause that ain't me. You know how this makes you look right? Don't... don't say it. Don't say that word. Once you say that word I know you're lost. You'll dismiss everything that I have to say. I need you to open your mind man and accept the possibility that something like this could actually happen. Alright. You think these private companies are satisfied just cloning mice? You think they're satisfied with just cloning mice and sheep? Using animals to grow simple body parts? You think they would just stop there, right? No. They're goal is to create the whole human person. Create a man that's programmed like a computer. A man easy to control. One with no moral code or humanity. A man that would follow orders without question. You need to calm down man. You're working yourself up too much. And it doesn't take much to clone you. All they need is a swab of your DNA. They can get it from anywhere. They can get it from your toothbrush, your hairbrush. A simple visit to the doctor and they'd have everything they need to make a replica of you. One that wouldn't fight, one that wouldn't argue, one that wouldn't disagree one that would do what they wanted him to do whenever they wanted him to do. No questions asked and no remorse. Investigators have wrapped up their primary investigation of the fiery bus crash that happened on I-5 a few days ago. Tow trucks are on the scene and we're told they'll begin pulling apart this wreckage, looking for any evidence that would explain to them why, according to their reports, the bus careened off an embankment, smashed into a group of trees and burst into flames. We now know, 10 people died in that crash, including the bus driver and two children. The names of those who perished in the crash are: Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds, George Barker, Steve, Maggie, and Cathy McAdams, Tony Montero, Becky Larson, Kevin Chan, and Jose Guzman. Those are the names. Those are the names you keep repeating. Who are those people? These were the people on the bus. The bus that I took to Washington. The one that stopped at the rest area, the one that I missed. These are people killed to cover up this conspiracy. I am not gonna let them go down quietly. C'mon man. That's a coincidence. There's to be an explanation for all of this. Enough. You don't believe me, that's fine. But no more talking. In other news, a new Ebola vaccine was created and is ready for mass production. KNX newstime 11:15. He's not telling you everything. What do you mean? He says he has proof. Some information that can prove he's innocent. Luke, what proof? You don't have anything, do you? Luke, if you have some kind of proof to clear your name, I suggest you use it. And use it now. Ignorance keeps you safe. And it's best if you don't know. I thought we had some kind of trust between us. We do. But they're killing everyone connected to this! Which is why I wanna get the hell outta here. Just let the man go Luke. You have nothing to gain by keeping him here. Nobody going nowhere until I say so. So I'm a hostage now? You can call it what you want. Just get comfortable, cause no body's going nowhere until I get some answers. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. The manhunt for the man suspected of assassinating the President, has come to a violent ending. Earlier today, anonymous tips led police to this location, an abandoned building in the Skid Row area, where Luke King was hiding from authorities. Multiple Enforcement Agencies converged on the building, he was found on the third floor. There was a brief gun battle and Luke King was shot and killed. Compared to what happened a few days ago at the White House, he was taken relatively easy. The police only shot 3 times and Luke King was hit 3 times. "I, for one, am glad its over." Police are removing the body from the building at the moment. It's been a difficult few days for America and now we can all grieve, knowing that Luke King, the man who assassinated our President, our Commander and Chief has been brought to Justice. The First Lady will be addressing the nation this evening at 8:00 PM. I can't believe it, you're right. I'm sorry I doubted you. It's over. I'll never have a normal life now. What are you talking about? If you really have proof, once you show them your proof, no one's gonna believe that. Are you kidding me? People believe everything they see on TV! I believe you Luke. I think you're innocent. But what you're doing man, evading authorities, armed carjacking, kidnapping. Man, you're making it all worse. Believe me when I tell you bro, I got your back. I'm here help you. This is just a case of mistaken identity. We can clear this all up. Have I ever let you down? Just give me the gun. Let's end this. Yo, what the fuck are you doing? What's up with the gun? What the fuck? Oh shit. Oh shit. You see it? You see it right? I see it! Get that thing away from me! Put down the gun Luke. You killed my friend. I'm your friend. I could be. Things could be just like they were, just come outside, with me. Today is a sad day in our News Station. Today we mourn the death of a colleague, one of our fellow reporters. Investigative Reporter Rebecca March was found murdered in her home last night. Shot to death by an unknown assailant. Neighbors heard loud noises around 2:00PM that afternoon. Witnesses saw a man walking from the scene. There are conflicting accounts of his description. Police are asking for help in solving this murder. During her last broadcast, she announced that she was set to launch a new investigation, something, she said, that would "shake the foundation of the US government. She claimed to have a confidential informant, someone with unique knowledge about the assassination. And she would be putting together a new segment that will expose corruption in the highest offices of our government. "Could this somehow be connected to the Luke King investigation?" Authorities will have a lot of questions to answer as they probe into what happened to Rebecca March. We'll have more updates as they come in. Rebecca March, our colleague, our friend, will be missed. Back to you Jim." Did you know her? We were supposed to meet in a park. After I realized I was wanted. I contacted her, told her who I was. She wanted to meet face to face. But she never made the meet, and I picked up a tail I've been trying to shake ever since. I got her killed. Wait. Wait. I've got to get samples. The research has to continue. Get it from the corpse. Wait, wait! Let me go in there and talk to him at least before you level the place. He's got important data, I need it. And I need the specimens to be alive. Hey Doc, how long have I been doing this? I keep telling you guys that when they start to notice our presence its time to put them down. But you don't listen to me. And I'm the one who gets stuck cleaning it up. And I'm tired of it. They go down. Look, you're the Handler, I'm the Doctor. Now you let me go in there do my job first, then you can do whatever the hell you wanted to. I don't care. Knock yourself out. Go. Luke King. Luke King. Who's out there? Come out Mr. King. It's time we have a talk. I... I... I'm a doctor Mr. King. I'd like to come inside please. Hell no. You have questions Mr. King. About your tour in the Middle East, the headaches, the black outs, your other half. Please, Mr. King open the door all things will become clear. Come in. Shut the door. Open your coat. What about my uh, my subject? It worked, I was right. The muscle mass, the strength. What about your speed and agility? You haven't been taking your medication. Of course not, why would you be taking your medicine now? Have you been experiencing headaches? Blackouts? The blackouts- The blackouts- It's completely defective, it's worthless. Please, I know its difficult to understand, but please, you've got to trust me. Take this. Why so you can kill me with it? No, no, no, no! I'm not your enemy Mr. King, I'm not your enemy. But believe me when I tell you, we don't have much time. What the hell is this? It's tetracycline. It's to help you, it's for your mind. I'm not taking anymore of your drugs doc, this whole experiment is over. It activates more receptors in your brain so you can get past the programming. What programming? The programming-The headaches. The headaches the blackouts, that's the mental block that they put in. Its to stunt you, to control you, to stop your potential. That's what they're doing. You've got to get past the veil so you can see through it, so you can get through the other side. So you can be who you really are. Please Mr. King. You've got to open your mind. You've got to see the system that creates the system. Do you understand me? Once you do that... Once you do that, you'll see everything, you'll understand all of it. That was just a clone. You're the original. That's why they want to kill you, that's why they want you dead. Why are you helping me? It started out, the science. They gave me the opportunity to do something I'd never done before, that nobody had every done before. That was what was so incredible about it. None of it had ever been done. But then, they took it over and they, they-All they wanted were perfect obedient soldiers. That's all they wanted to create. Those tests, what did they do to me? You were our very first subject, you were the toughest subject we ever had. You were very resistant to all of the mind control. But eventually they found a way and they broke through. And then they, they-replaced your memories that you wouldn't know about our experiments. You set? Set to go. Target the boy? Take the shot. Take the shot. Take the shot. Now. No. Why did they do this to me? The didn't do it just to you. They did it to your whole team. You were the first group of soldiers ever created. Who were designed specifically to infiltrate and to become a part of a society or community and then wait to be activated, by them. For whatever means necessary. Then why clone me? Because you broke from the program Mr. King. You broke with the program. You didn't obey orders. You see, when they tell you to fire, you do it or they replace you. And Angel, why clone Angel? My employers are uh, they're paranoid Mr. King. And they have a real, need for secrecy. They wanted to know who it was that you talked to about them, if you talked to anyone about them. So they decided to clone your friend. They figured that would make you talk but it didn't. You didn't talk. And, believe me, they're going to turn to more aggressive methods. Why did they kill the president? Look I uh. I've said too much, okay? Look just... just, take the injection Mr. King please. What did they gain by it? Control? Control over what? Over who? I've said too much already Mr. King please just take the injection. Who's behind all of this? Holy fucking shit man. Holy shit man what was that. Cut me loose, cut me loose. I don't want to be apart of this cut me loose. Hell no get me out I don't wanna die like this. Shh. C'mon out Luke, it's time to end this. The doctor was the diplomatic approach, the passive way. Our attempt, to use a scalpel to fix the situation. Now we do things my way. Now you got 60 seconds to get your ass out here, drop the gun, tell us what you know, and die. Or, I call in a drone attack and incinerate this whole house, and go after everyone you ever cared about. Your choice. Hey. Wait. I believe you. I can help you. C'mon, let me help you. Times up King. You the one that took the shot at me in the park? If it was me you'd be dead. My guy missed. You ran. But I told you, there's nowhere you can run from me. But I'm not running now am I? What do you want? I wanna know where we stand. Did you tell anybody about us? What about my employers, are they secure? All you had to do was go down with the bus. Why do you want me dead? Everyone of you say that. Who the hell are you? I saw you talking to the doc. You think you know, but you don't know what the hell is going on. Been skipping your meds right? Starting to get headaches. Starting to see visions of yourself doing chores. Starting to put it all together. Do you wanna know why I know exactly what you're feeling? Because I've seen it a dozen times, and I'm getting sick and tired of it. It's a dance I've been doing way too long. The doctor told me the truth. And what truth is that? He told me about the others. I will stop you. No more clones of me, or my team to do your dirty work. Did the doc tell you that you were the original? You killed the president. Please Mr. King take the injection. The original Luke King, is dead. Please, it's the help... Take the injection! Enough! That's bull shit I'm the original. Nah, no you're not. You're the clone my man. You may say it, but that don't make it true. I'm you're Handler Mr. King. I'm the one who activates you. I'm the one who calls you. I'm the one who gives you a trigger word and watches you kill. I'm your puppet master. Wanna guess who you are? You're the one making me kill people aren't you. Of course I am. That's what you were made for. That's your designation. Sleeper soldier number 5. Its a damn shame about that reporter. But I put that on you. You should've never contacted her. If you would have just kept your damn mouth shut. You'd still be living your blissfully pathetic life. And still be our clone. And the people on the bus? What about them? They died for no reason. Again, you're fault. Those people should've died with you, that was their purpose. You pull the trigger when I tell you to pull the trigger. You don't get to walk away from this. One word from me, and you'll take that gun out, and blow your fucking brains out. From here on out, I make my own choices. Rosebud. Damn. He broke the cage. No. I can't be. Monroe? You're looking at the next generation super soldier. Stronger. Faster. No weakness and no mercy. I don't have to turn him on. He stays on. I can't hurt him. I can't do it. I won't. If only he could see what I see. But he doesn't know what I know. They're still controlling him. I don't wanna hurt you brother. But he's still asleep. You can't break the programming for him. He has to do it himself. Looks like you forgot your training. Finish him. Now. Let's go! What the hell is going on with you? Let's go. Finish him! Forgive me brother. May you awaken in the next life. C'mon. Luke. Luke let's go. Luke. Luke c'mon! Stay put. But I can help you. You already did now stay put. Go around back. Looks like you do remember your training. So you got him? I got him. What kind of dirt did you have on 'em? Nothing. I was bluffing until the doc spilled the beans. Now, I got everything I need. Hand it over. Give me the tape. Shi... target's on the move. Stop the car! Let him in. Open the door. Drive! Stay with him. And get him to talk. We'll follow. It's funny. Every agent in the country looking for you, the most dangerous man on the most wanted list. And I'm the one to bring you in. Problem for you is, they don't want you brought in alive. I woke up to a war, A war I didn't even know existed. Its not a physical war. Its a war of the mind, a war of the spirit. Who's behind this? Everything they ever told me is a lie. What are they trying to keep me from? I don't know. But I can't be the only one. There has to be others out there. I'll find them. From this moment on every breath that I take is for the mission, the mission for the truth. This is the beginning. Subtitles by explosiveskull
