- Come on, daddy! - I want to come with you! Come on, go on your own! - Well. - Yeah! What a pity! It would be a nice ship and we could work. Do you have a cigarette? - Did you find anything? - What could I find? Boarding shifts are very slow. Maybe it will be my turn in 12 or 13 years. Meanwhile, those are working a lot. Nowadays, children are a great concern. Hey, you! Tokyo, Manila, Madagascar! Look, if I get up, I'll tan you. They are devils. Your home must be like a shipping agency. They were born on memorable journeys. Every time I left, I conceived one, and once back, I named them by the ports where I had been. When will you get married? - Me? - Yes. Never. Life is hard. You're alone. That's lucky. Listen... I was here with an idea... Do you see that ship? Hey, knurled, American, the real ones. These are fake, and they're not American as it says. These are national. And so? You win and not me. - Me? - Of course! These are original, national, guaranteed, here. But... - Pietro, let's go! - Here I am! Lucky to have found the national ones. That one puts sawdust, instead. That's crazy! Rio! Your father and the commander are waiting for us. - There are great things in the air! - Really? Let's go. - Let's go to the commander. - Are there good hopes? Yes. We will make a cooperative, we will have to work hard to get the ship up and everyone will work. There will be sacrifices, too. As for the money, it takes a lot and we don't have any. We must hear from the government, that will almost certainly help us. Then we must not neglect safer and more ready aid. I thought... - ...of Matteo La spin a. - La spin a? He is an owner who can do a lot for us, if he wants. I think we would better kill him! - You're right dad. - He made his money by sinking his boats, pocketing the insurance. That's a dangerous man. That's a man who minds his business. Listen, I know what Matteo La spin a is like, but the other owners have all their capital committed, while La spin a doesn't know how to invest it. Excuse me. We get the ship up, we put it afloat and who enjoys it, La spin a? No. You got it all wrong. When the ship is recovered and put online, it will have cost millions, but will be ours too, - we will have our carats. - What are these? The carats of the ship are 24, 12 for La spin a who gave the money, the others divided among all the crew. What else? And if we are good, we can redeem Laspina's ones. - We have a deal? - Yes, okay. Well. Today I'm going to talk to La spin a. I was interested in you, even when you were a prisoner in Africa -and I can say I know all your story. - Thank you. Here I am, how are you? I need to talk to you about something important. - Oh, yes. - Very important. So, Diana leave us alone. Please take a seat. Here are my friends, they have already eaten. Well, let's hear. It's that carcass in the middle of the port, the Santa Maria. - Of course, it's mine. - Yours? I asked for it. I want to re-float it. And if the Ministry authorizes me to recover... Besides, I have enough money. That's it. - Tell me what you wanted to do? - Not me, us. - You? Who? - A cooperative, all sailors. - Sailors? - We need work. Yes, the foolish ideas that go around nowadays. No, don't even think about it and above all, do not interfere in my business, otherwise we end badly. So I'm leaving, I came here to negotiate a deal with a gentleman, but my sailors were right, you are a special gentleman. Poor little ones, you are still hungry. You say an unserviceable ship, you say a carcass, that no longer floats, you say. Well, you say you want to float it and come to me so that my shipping company advances you the money needed to start the work, provided that the government grant it to you. But the government... Antonietta, give me some white wine. - White. - What was I saying? Did you eat? Didn't you?? We have already sent the cooperative's application to Rome. The application is okay, but the answer? Here is the point, the answer. If the government says yes, I will need to hear the opinion of my partners. I don't want to give you illusions, what I can promise you is I will speak to my associates. Where can I call you for the answer? At the port café. All right. So I will call on Thursday evening at 11. Fried! Thank you, Mr. Molisani, and let's hope for the best. Fried! So we play in Heaven. And so you pay here on earth. Nothing? - Did he say 10:307? - No, 11. Hello, who is speaking? Pardon? Professor Petrosi? You got the wrong number. Damn the professors, too. Five, four, one. Hello? It's you, Marinella? Yes, it's me, Teresina. How did it go, today? Don't talk about Giorgio, I can't stand him, he's so obnoxious and vulgar. Forget him, take my advice. There are dozens of guys like him. Do you know I was with Giulia, today? We reconciled. Yes. A letter for the captain. She wanted to pay for me, and so I ate a lot. Yes, a lot. Poor Giulia, she was so upset that I almost regret it. SINCERELY, MY BEST WISHES FOR YOUR INITIATIVE! ...the pink dress. She's not worth dressing better, she's so fat. How can you be elegant with a hippo figure like that? Do you think so? She talked about his successes for an hour, as if I could believe her. That's enough! For God! Go away! Sorry, I'll call you later. What a fury, I just said a few words. What vulgar men! Two words? Hello? Commander Cioli? One moment. Commander Cioli, the telephone. - The telephone. - The telephone! - What manners! - Shut up. Hello? Commander Molisani. All right. We'll come right away. The ship for which the recovery was planned is a real disaster. It has two leaks and the machines are very damaged, the holds, I have the report here, are almost unrecognizable. My dear ones, realize that with the best will in the world... With the best will in the world, this enterprise can only be regarded with terror. My associates were actually stunned by your idea, an undoubtedly daring, noble idea, but too full of unknowns. Full of unknowns and dangers. Put yourself in our shoes. This is to tell you that this is an impossible problem. Impossible at first sight, but we have solved it. And do you know how? By accepting your proposal. Holy shit! Why didn't you tell us before? - Thank you, Mr. Molisani! - Hurray! Long live Molisani. Hello? Commander Molisani, yes, it's me. We have started the recovery work. Everything is going well. Thanks, Molisani. No, not yet. The divers are working hard, but something came up. Hey, you two! Next time I catch you playing, you'll see. Hey, always good! Good boy! Here's your men's pay. - Paolo? - Here you are. - What a pittance! - Pietro. Money's too tight. When we are done, things will change. - We will be all millionaires. - Let's hope! In a few years, the ship will be ours. Let's consider three full-load trips a year... Molisani, we did well! Yes! We finally did it! - Good morning. - Good morning. - What an ugly ship. - It's ugly, but it's good. - Sorry, it's your creature. - Mine? It belongs to everyone. - Best wishes to the whole cooperative. - Thank you. And enjoy your work. Hey, did you hear her? She called you "cooperative". Take this. Do you have a navigation book? Are you on a job seeker's list? Excuse me! Are you the captain? One moment! One at a time! You first. Memories. - Women like you a lot. - I don't know. So they say. - Have you ever fallen in love? - Never! I know women, my dear, and will never marry. I am not crazy. Beautiful! - But I have to leave. - I'm saying you can't, if papers are not in order. One at a time. - I'm The Golden Butterfly. - Congratulations. - Do you know me? - No. If only you knew how distracted I am. My crew was waiting for me in Genoa, but I thought I had to embark in Naples. I'm here, they're in Genoa. Funny. I can't leave them alone in Buenos Aires, they would starve. - Documents. - Dory Jane is always in order. Antonietta Capuzzeti. Big family, on stage I had to change name. - Wait a moment. - Okay, trés bien. Tell me, miss. I have a sick brother in Buenos Aires, I am alone in the world. I have to join my brother, who is very sick. I have no documents, but... I'm sorry, but I just can't, you heard what I said. Please, mister captain, just think I'm alone. - I don't have anyone. - Yes, but... Haven't you heard? We can't board you, we have responsibilities. Go to the police station. - Pietro! - I've been there, they told me to come back in a month, but I can't wait. I don't know what to do. Go to the office and give her a cabin. - Pietro, a luxury one. - Yes, ma'am. - Veranda, two bathrooms, screening room? - Yes. We worked to get the ship afloat and we succeeded, now we have to work to send it around the world. Thank you all. And we must remember who helped us, without selfishness and stinginess. - Long live Molisani! - Hurray. And we also thank Mr. La spin a, leaving with us with his daughter and who helped us with the first load to and from Buenos Aires. - Long live La spin a! - Hurray! - Here's to them and to us. - Long live the commander! ITALIAN MERCHANT SHIP "SANTA MARIA" JOURNAL 15 AUGUST GUARD FROM 10 PM TO 1 AM GOOD SEA REGULAR NAVIGATION - Check all the lifeboats. - Okay, commander! - Good morning, is there a lot to do? - Yes. How charming, the infinite sea... It's a thrill. Hey, boy. Good sea, right? Yes, an oil. - Will it be like this tomorrow? - God will send me a telegram. So let's wait. What is this chant? Very good. - You have a beautiful voice, you know? - Yes. It could be a great performance. - Where, in the penal colony? - Silly boy, at the variety. Shall we try a duet together? Yes, a duet. - How do you feel? - Good, but listen here. - How it gallops. - I feel like at my first date with Teresa. Is your wife happy? She used to cry because I didn't sail, now she cries because I go far. You never know what women want. I was waiting for you. I told you I can only come late. If the captain knows it, at the first port he will disembark you and punish me. You have water, well, then I'm leaving. - See you tomorrow. - Thank you. Is there no way to play some poker? The crew is not allowed to play with passengers. I did it right under his nose! - And you... - Come here. - You screwed me, huh? -But I... Who knows! Here on board, is there really no chance to spend the evening, a game for little money? Under the bunks, you will find a player ready. Oh, thank goodness, little money, just for fun. - Well, what happened? - I have a headache. - You played, cheated and were punished. - But this isn't over! And my dear, what need is there to do these bad things, when it's so easy in your position to make some money? - Money? - Yes. How? You are not meant to be on the same ship all your life, serving the same commander. - Yeah, what would you do? - Me? If I were you, I would soon sell my share in this business of the cooperative, I could put at least 200,000 lire in my pocket. 200,000 lire? Yes, it is simple. Now I'll explain how you can do it. - Commander. - Good morning. You ran away last night. That's not nice. A captain always woos passengers. Maybe, but in the morning I look in the mirror. - Don't you have a love in your life? - Yes, this ship. Okay, I understand, but I meant a woman, the joy of a woman. Commander, here's your coffee. Bring me another one. - All right. - What kindness! Dear Diana, stop joking. Let's try to remain good friends. - Well, have you thought about it? - Yes, but... Here's a man who, in front of 200 bucks, says: "Yes, but..." Can you see? He can't even find the words. I swear I don't know how to count it. Yet, you might have it too. - Pardon? - Yes. Here, commander. Why do you look at this young lady so badly? He dislikes me. - But no. What do you say, miss? - Here. Just what we need! Giovanni is a sailor, not a canary. Excuse me. - Bravo! - Go! Miss, please don't teach Giovanni how to sing. - He's talented. - My sailors have other things to do. - But art comes out anyway. - Once again, stop it. What a brutal man. - What did you do to that eye? - Me? A political discussion, I am attached to my ideas. - And who wanted to take it off? - Well, Paolo. Tell me, Paolo, what does this political discussion mean? Political discussion, with whom? - Don't be dumb, why did you punch Pietro? - Me? Where are you going? Come here. Don't you have a part in this? I'm sorry, but some jokes... Stay still, let him speak. - I can't stand the rip-offs. - Damn! PUNISHMENTS: 3 DAYS You too, my son, among the punished sailors. Great! Gambling addiction again, huh? He'll pay for this, I'm not staying here. - And I will also get a good deal. - What deal? I'll take some money and then away, free citizen. 16 AUGUST GUARD FROM 7 PM TO 24 PM SECOND DAY OF PUNISHMENTS REGULAR NAVIGATION I did the math, after this first trip, each of us will collect three times the money under normal conditions. - Three times only? - Did you expect to buy a villa? Not a villa, but since I am co-owner of a ship, I thought to put half of my children in a boarding school. Well, co-owner yes, but we are many. But I thought better. Isn't working in freedom enough for you? Go. One day you'll understand. Help! Open up! A stowaway on board! - Leave me!! - Let's get her to the commander. Leave me! Don't hurt me! Man overboard! Stop! Full reverse! Help! Help! Help! Thank you. - What happened? - A stowaway overboard. I was just wondering why there weren't stowaways on board. - How exciting! - Please, take care of this wretch. - This girl is hungry. - How do you know? I know it, on stage you learn many things. Come on, go get some milk, some cookies. Come on, poor thing, it will be better. I'll know who did it. - Who could? - Who? She couldn't embark and hide alone for such a long time. Someone helped her and brought her food. - Who? I just can't figure out. - Who? Wait. I will find him for you. - What's that stuff? - She's hungry. Hungry, huh? I understand why she's hungry, go. Not only you play here, which is prohibited, but you also allow yourself to smuggle passengers on board. Jesus, this is new to me! How much did you get from her? - How much? - Only 10,000 lire, I swear. The money will be withheld from your pay. It means I'll make it back in some other way. - And let's hope it's an honest way. - Fuck... Is it better now? We must talk, leave me alone with her. I've seen you before. - In Naples. - You wanted to ship. The sick brother, all lies! Then you left with Pietro. - Then you made the contract. - No! How much did Pietro take to embark you? Pietro? Nothing. Lies! I gave him 10,000 lire, but I swear he didn't ask me for anything. He took pity on me. And you? Help me, don't make me disembark. My brother is waiting for me, he is so sick. Don't let me disembark. I can't do otherwise miss, believe me. You can't go against the laws. Calm down, now rest. THE FOLLOWING SAILORS HAVE ALREADY GIVEN ME THEIR SHARE OF THE SHIP Who's there? Come in. Is that you? It seems to me that our commander has been very, very worried lately about the clandestine passenger. My dear Diana, this is a losing battle for you. We'll see. 17 AUGUST GUARD FROM 7.30 TO 10.30 GOOD SEA REGULAR NAVIGATION WE ARE GETTING CLOSER TO THE EQUATOR THIS EVENING CROSSING THE EQUATOR GREAT SHOW WITH DORY JANE, JEAN PREMIER I don't like this Jean Premier, wasn't Giovanni Proietti right? You don't understand anything. It's like "Chevalier", more international. It will be your battle name, fool. In Buenos Aires, I will make you a contract, you have a beautiful voice and I like you. Commander the equator is approaching, big party, huh? Listen, try to distract that girl a little bit, then, if you have a dress to get for her... - Okay, I'll do it. - Thank you. What are you doing? Go away. It will be a fun party and you have to come. Have you read the manifesto? You have to come. You are very kind, but I... You will dance, and you will sing too. It will be a beautiful party, I have a very elegant, special dress for you. It is not a difficulty for me, I have 207 clothes, 200 in Rome and 7 here. Come on, dear, come with me. Here, I can lend you this dress. Oh, no. This is a memory of when I used to sing for Prince Mohamed... The East. Oh, yes. I can give this to you, do you like it? No, I'm not giving it to you, I'm in love with it. How distracted I am, this is a model from Paris. Look. Look what a splendour. This dress would suit you very well, do you want it? Well no, this is for me. Excuse me, don't you have any dress? Very well! The Duchess Tchaikovsky wore a dress like this, but it doesn't matter. - Don't you dance? - No, thanks. So let's go for a walk, shall we go? Of course, I want all your carats, otherwise, how could I have the majority? You collect the adhesions and when you bring them to me, I will pay you. - You have to be careful with Gaspare. - He's tough. I got it. - Nice boy your son, too bad... - What? That he serves the captain coffee instead of being, I don't know, someone. He says it too, he wants to go to the nautical institute. Machinist officer? Very good. - But without money... - The money is always there. - Who was I? Nothing more than you. - Yes. But see if, for example, you expect luck from this ship, it will take time, if everything goes well. Instead, you take what you can, right away. Better an egg today than a chicken tomorrow, believe me. Do not leave me With my heart in pain anymore Because if I miss you, I can lose myself Tell me, my passion, where your love is Tell me if your heart is in tears Just like mine When love goes the other way It will never find again this happiness It will never find my life again... - A little more serene? - Yes. A very nice song, right? The lyrics are beautiful: "Don't leave me anymore, I love you." END OF THE FIRST HALF SECOND HALF GASPARE HAS GIVEN HIS CARATS TO ME. We'll celebrate in Buenos Aires. Is this the first time an Italian ship arrives there? It's the first time a ship managed by sailors arrives in Buenos Aires. Newspapers will talk about it. When will you understand what we've done? - What? No, I didn't mean anything. We have done this because we are not made to live like friars in a convent. Everyone has his own projects, for example Rio wants to go to the nautical institute. Everyone does his business, guys, and you have to think and provide too. As for me, I already have the money in my pocket. Mr. La spin a pays immediately. Are you sure I can work at the variety? - I want to stay in Argentina. - You have to buy some things. Shirts, shoes, clothes, a tailcoat. You will be charming. Au revoir, chérie. "Au revoir chérie..."” Go to hell! How don't you find a moment for me? - Diana, you... - Listen to me, could this be the last time we talk, you're being mean with me. Maybe you forgot the departure... My feelings for you are always the same, your life is so different from mine, that I would become a poor wretch. I promised you my friendship, we can be good friends. - All right. - Excuse me. I'm sure when I get back, my wife will tell: "We will have another child". Dear Stefano, it's always the same for me, I go to the sea, away from my wife, and I celebrate my departure with enthusiasm, because I am always in love with my wife. - What'll you call? - Buenos Aires. What if they are twins? If they are twins, the gentler Buenos and the more mischievous Aires. I heard you want to be a singer, bravo! If you need money, we can arrange. I could buy your share. Listen, Gaspare, what did you tell your wife, your girlfriend at the time, when you decided to marry her? A few words, I took her to church, the priest made us kneel for an hour, then he blessed us. "Oremus", "Amen" and we were husband and wife. We were happy. It was the right marriage because Teresa is a simple woman. A simple woman, that's right. What would you say if your commander also got married? You would do well, at your age. - Good morning. - Good morning. - It's hot, isn't it? - Yes. - Would you like a cigarette? - I don't smoke. I don't smoke either, for the voice. Yesterday I listened to you. You have a beautiful voice. Thank you. Go and replace Pietro, it's time. - Good morning. - Good morning. - It's hot, isn't it? - Yes. - Cigarette? - I never smoke. I smoke a lot, bad habit. Listen Alda, these days I've been thinking... Tomorrow we will arrive. I will try to fix your situation. - The Italian Consul is my friend, you... - Thank you. How naive. If I was in his shoes... - Who's there? - May I enter? - Come in. - Good morning, miss. Good morning. - Does that work? - Yes, thanks. I will stay in Argentina too, right in Buenos Aires. Really? - We can meet, then. - Of course. One day I will be very rich and I will think about fixing my life. Goodbye, miss. - Come in. - Good morning, miss. I decided to take you to your brother, okay? Are you happy? You are so good to me. It's hot, isn't it? - Tell me, does the fan work? - Yes. - Well. Good morning. - Good morning. I haven't seen my brother in six years and his last letter is two months ago. Where are we? It's a complete chaos here. Excuse me, Calle de Canovas? - Italian? - Yes. - How are you? I am Italian, too. - Well. But where is Calle de Canovas? I'm from Genoa, do you know any Parodi in Genoa? Many, but I want to know where... - Calle de Canovas? Right away. - Yes. One moment, I'll ask. - Are you Italian? I'm from Naples. - Here is all of Italy. - Where is Calle de Canovas? - Here you go straight, there is a good restaurant, with macaroni, Neapolitan pizza... I'm not hungry, I just want to... Okay, then go right and take a small street to the left, there is Calle.. de Lopas. - I don't understand. - It's so clear. I'll take you. So? Here it is. Now excuse me, but I have to finish a beard that has probably grown again. Best wishes and good luck. Greet Italy so much. A nice kiss to Italy, goodbye. Wait a minute, my brother may have moved. OK, I'll wait. - Are you Italian? - Sicilian. This is nonsense. Dory Jane? Who is she? I heard Gigli singing, brilliant. It's Ruggeri. And the grammar? Once he said: "To be or not to be", everyone was crying. And where is this our... He's dead. He's been dead for a month. Come on. Alda, calm down. I'll do everything possible to compensate for the loss of your brother. Let's go back to the ship, what do you want to do here? Once in Italy we can... You will be able to start your life again. You're so young. Come on. Wait and pay attention to the bags. Michelito! Dory! Finally, my love, after ten years! Years go by so fast! Star of my heart, you are always very beautiful, charming, divine. My darling, you look so good. Beautiful girl! - Is this La Carmencita Theater? - Theater... - Who's Michelito? - He's the boss. What do you want? I sing. Tell me, will I be able to earn a lot, here? Dear Jean, take our bags to the dressing room. Are you crazy? - Oh, hey, sir! - What a knight! Scoundrel! I was born to suffer, I had created that thing from nothing. Have they made up their minds at the company? They weren't that happy, but finally here is your contract. You understand, the sum is a bit high. Why insure myself for a small amount? - That's my business. - Yes, sure! - Would you sign here? - Yes. That's it, and then have a good trip, Mr. La spin a. - Thanks, my friend, and good luck. - Same to you. Gaspare, to complete the safety device for the flammable cargo, power must be off, except at the time of inspection. Okay, I'll go now. Before making up my mind, I did some math. It takes two years to earn the same sum. - Now, you can to the Nautical Institute. - Yes. Madagascar and Manila can go to boarding school. But what worries me is Stefano. You understand that I have sold my share... - But everyone did it. - Everyone? So, I have to tell Stefano everything, immediately! - Are you happy? - Look. - What is that? - All these people gave me their share, so the ship is about to become mine and it's cheap. - Is all this legal? - If it isn't, it will be. - And Stefano? - I think he will be a little surprised, but business is business. Good deal, really good deal! In a few years we would have been the masters. I wanted to work with my sailors, a real collaboration, and you ruined everything! But I didn't know that everyone... I'll go to La spin a and tell... What do you want to tell him? You signed up, that's enough. Let me go, I can't see anymore! Holy shit! I came too. Yes, for my share, to leave it, as my sailors did. We worked together to refloat this ship, we sailed it, we were the masters of it, together. It's right that together we sell it to Mr. La spin a, with the difference that they sold their share, believing they were doing who knows what deal, while I give it to you to be able to tell to your face that you are an exploiter, a thief, and to take this opportunity to break your nose! One of the most filthy carrion that has dirtied the world! Commander, are you injured? It's nothing. Lock him in the cabin, under surveillance. Give us that document back. - Take the money. - Are you crazy? - You signed and law... - Papers out! - Come on, let's go! - Crook! And so we cancel led the deal, please forgive us. Yes, La spin a had cheated us! Damn the money! What a beautiful hogwash! - Forgive us, on behalf of everyone. - All right. Well, now go, guys. He is so good. Stay still, I don't want this to end badly. Don't worry, I'll fix these things. - A shot of a revolver and... - Then the war. Funny! Come in. We are about to dock in Cagliari, and you have to disembark. I had meant to do it. You'd better not tell anything - about what happened here. - All right. I will not speak. Whatever may happen later, I will not. Come in. - Ready? - There is time, right? Not that much. I'll come right away, wait for me. Thanks, that's fine. Come in. Good morning, - I'm sorry for what happened. - He just sneaked me. In three days, I will forget it. I wish you would forgive me. You didn't do anything wrong. Goodbye. Goodbye. You are already here. Let's go. To the central hotel. Hell, where did I put it? Have you seen the policy? Damn, where... May it be this one? 200,000? Such a strong insurance? - Mind your business. Let's go eat. - I'm not hungry! What's wrong? Been taken by some melancholy? I'm simply not hungry! Don't regret not being on that carcass anymore, you will agree. - What do you mean? - I'm just saying. I frankly wasn't happy with that flammable load. It's a moment. What are you talking about? I'm making a very sensible speech. Sometimes you leave, but don't arrive. What does it mean? You've done something, I'll be back aboard. Go ahead, you will not arrive on time. You will not arrive on time, now. Take me offshore, I have to reach the Santa Maria! Santa Maria! Santa Maria! The lady wants to get on board! Santa Maria! The lady wants to get on board! - What happens? - I need the commander! - He's sick. - It's urgent! Here we go. - What's up? - Miss Diana is back on board, she has something important to say. - So, let her in. - Well. Don't go away, you better be here. You never know with this family. What's happened? I'm sure my father prepared something against you, before leaving this ship. - What could he have done? - I think the ship is in danger. Gaspare, do an efficient inspection, right now. Thanks for the warning, Diana. Listen, find me immediately any means that can reach the ship Santa Maria. But Mr. La spin a, at this time of night, it is absolutely not possible. Every moment is precious and we have to search. No matter how much we've searched, we could blow up at any moment. No time to waste, go! - What can I do? - You can help others. Pietro, Paolo? Go on deck and search in every corner. La spin a is capable of anything. You too, on the deck! You at the machines or in the cabins, wake up! Search carefully! - I found nothing. - Search again. Go to the hold, Rio, - move the crates, take a good look. - Okay, dad. - I found nothing. - Search again. - Nothing! - Search! - The hold is okay. - Go again! Search in hold number two, I'll go to the commander. - Urgent, send now. - All right. TELEGRAM TO BE SENT FORM, VERY URGENT DO NOT LIGHT UP THE HOLD Light up the hold. We got stuck! Come on! Giovanni! Fire Extinguishers! Isolate the hold, quick! Quick you, come here! Come on! - At the pumps, quick! - Immediately! - What happened? - The hold is isolated, go to the cabin. Come on, miss, I'm here. - Isn't there any news for me, yet? - No, sir. No? The Italian merchant ship Santa Maria which left our port this morning suffered a serious fire, but thanks to the crew, the ship is safe. Three victims: Mario Bianchi, Rio Marani, Diana La spin a. Paris, latest sports news. The great car race that aroused so much interest for the participation of great guests, ended with the victory... Santa Maria. Diana. Santa Maria. Diana. Santa Maria. This is a sad ceremony. We say goodbye to our dear companions, who sacrificed their lives for the salvation of the ship.
