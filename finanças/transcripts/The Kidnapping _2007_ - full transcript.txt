[ Car door closes ] [ Car alarm chirps ] [ Television turns on ] [ Man speaking indistinctly on television ] [ Clang ] Did you get it? What -- wait -- i-i, uh -- all I want to know is whether you got it or not. Look, I can't get into a safety deposit box just like that. Ugh! You're gonna get into the safety deposit box and you're gonna get us what's in there. I can't because it's virtually impossible without a client's authorization. Why don't you just help us? How 'bout you reconsider? Help me. Baxter. My heart. Hey, hey. Call somebody. What's the hell's wrong with you? [ Choking ] [ Rings ] Hey, it's me. The guy died on us before I had a chance to convince him. He cannot get into the safety deposit box if he is dead. Look, he was never gonna help us anyway. We had no leverage. [ Beeps ] Good luck out there. Thanks. Thank you. Okay, you ready for your history quiz? Did Columbus discover America? Ahh, smart. Joke of the day? Hit me. Knock, knock. Who's there? Dwayne. Dwayne, who? "Dwayne" the bathtub! I'm "dwowning"! Ah, very good. You're the best. Yeah, you're okay, too. Thank you. Okay, listen. Lucy's gonna pick you up after school and stay with you until Karen gets there. Now, you know where Lucy's number is on the fridge. Of course. So you and Karen -- you call her if you need anything, okay? You're coming home before you leave, right? Absolutely. Love you. Love you, too. Have a good day, honey. Good morning. Good morning. Hey, guys. Schultz: It's just so tragic about Baxter. He just died too young. You know, he worked here for 16 years. I guess it just goes to show you -- you can never take anything for granted. Yeah, he really pushed himself these last few months, trying to get the new system up and running. Well, anyway, I want to thank you for stepping in on such short notice. I'm happy to do it, sir. You know we're depending on you, Rachel. All right, now the next step, for which tomorrow's meeting is so important. Our stockholders need to know that our security is beyond reproach. If national accepts the results of the work that you and Baxter did here, I don't need to tell you it's gonna mean a big gold star on our report card. Well, you know, Mr. Schultz, Baxter and I share the same philosophy -- solid defense and backup systems. Excellent. Hey. Hi, Rachel. Uh-oh. We have a winner. Don't you have anything better to do than spy on me, frank? If you want the truth, no. It's annoying. Okay, we're in banking, so let's add it up. You're going to the meeting instead of Baxter. You've been working hand-in-hand with him on the new security system, and Baxter's job is open because he ate nothing but chicken-fried steak with a chocolate-cake chaser his entire life. You're talking about a friend of mine who just died. Come on. You know you're getting it, Ms. Vice president. Don't you have some work to do, frank? [ Sighs ] Hi. Hey, mom. Hey, rach. Thanks for picking her up, Lucy. Don't need to say that. You still leaving tonight? Mm-hmm. 'Fraid so. But you've been working late every night this week. I know, honey. This weekend... Is just with you and me, no work, okay? Karen's staying with you, right? Yeah. She here yet? No. [ Doorbell rings ] There she is. Hi! Sorry I'm late. No problem. Come on in. Okay, well, I'm off to the blogosphere. Okay. Have a good trip. Thanks. I'll let you know how it goes. And you guys call if you need anything. Thank you. Well, Hannah, I got the whole plan. We're gonna go to a movie after school and then dinner at a very cool place. We're gonna have an amazing time. We better, or your rep is toast. Come on. You want to help me pack? Okay. Cool. Let's be honest. Any security can be breached, but we start with a state-of-the-art defense followed by multiple lines of encryption, and with national utilizing our new system, there will be no other banking operation that offers their clients more protection for their accounts than we do. Someone may be able to breach one wall, but the chances of them being able to breach the backup to the backup to the backup are miniscule. [ Cellphone ringing ] Rachel McKenzie. Well, I already heard. It went brilliantly. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Yeah, I think they appreciate the work we've been doing at the branch. Yeah. Great job. Thanks. So, I hope you have a relaxing weekend planned. Well, this is the first time that I've been away from my daughter overnight, so we're planning on spending it together, just the two of us. Oh, good. When you return, you'll have something to celebrate because you are officially being made vice president next week. Congratulations. Oh, my god! Thank you, Mr. Schultz! Thank you! No, no, no. You don't thank me. You thank yourself for doing such great work. You have a terrific flight, Rachel. Thanks. [ Giggles softly ] [ Telephone ringing ] Hi, this is Rachel. We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave a message. Hi. It's me. Pick up. Hannah, are you there? Karen? Hello, hello? Where are you guys? Thank you. Please, hurry. Ma'am? It's okay, thank you! Your change! Shoot. Rachel: "We have your daughter. "We don't want to hurt her. "Do not contact the police... "Or she will be killed. "Follow these instructions. Get out of the way! "If you ever want to see her alive again, "drive to the boardwalk. "At exactly 5:00, "one of the pay phones will ring. "Be there to answer it... "Or your daughter will be killed. "This is not a joke. "It is not a prank. This is real." [ Ringing ] Don't answer that! Don't answer that phone! Hello? You were one ring away from losing your daughter. I'm sorry. Are you? Is this situation not serious to you? [ Crying ] Yes, it's serious. Please...don't hurt her. Please don't hurt her. That's up to you. Just tell me what you want. I want you to get into safety deposit box number 14533. What? I'll repeat it. At your bank, get into safety deposit box number 14533. You have until the close of business tomorrow. I need to talk to Hannah. Listen! Underneath the pay phone, there's a cell. It can't be traced. We will contact you. [ Dial tone ] Well, well, well. How you doing, stranger? How you doing? What, you been on some top-secret stakeout lately? Oh, I wish. Then I would be sitting, not on my feet all day. How about you? Anything special? Ye-- no. I'm the king of b&e -- seems like all I get. Look, I got to run. Don't be a stranger. I'll see you around. Hey, you know what? What? We should grab cardoza and get some lunch one day. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Old cardoza. Okay. That'll be great. That'll be nice. Later. [ Tires screech ] Hannah? Hannah? Hannah? Karen? Hannah? Karen? Guys? Guys? First unheard message. Hannah: Hi, mommy. The movie was funny. Now, I think we're going for food. Don't worry. I'll make Karen eat healthy. Can't wait to see you. Love you. Bye. [ Doorbell rings ] Mr. Cardoza? [ Barking ] Mr. Cardoza, are you home? Hello? Hello? [ Knocks on door ] Hello? Oh, god. [ Coughs ] Hello? Mr. Cardoza? Is anybody here? Hello? Mr. Cardoza? Mr. Cardoza? Hello? Mr. Cardoza? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh. [ Gagging ] [ Coughing ] [ Groans ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ Gasping ] [ Barking ] What is it boy? What the-- Tiger! Don't go in there! Tiger! Hey, come back here! Is anybody here? Tiger? Tiger? Is anybody here? Hello? Hello? Tiger? Tiger? Tiger? Tiger? [ Dog barks ] Tiger? Where'd you go? [ Tape ripping ] Tiger, you upstairs? [ Barking ] Tiger? Hey, anybody up here? I'm looking for my dog. Tiger? Tiger? Oh, tiger... [ Gasps ] [ Barks ] [ Barking ] Tiger! Tiger! Come back! Tiger! [ Screams ] Tiger, get down! Bad dog! [ Breathing heavily ] Good morning. Hey, guys. [ Telephone ringing ] Hello? Hey. Hey, rach. Hey, how'd the big presentation go? Sweetie, what's the matter? I didn't want to wake you, but, uh -- are you kidding? I haven't slept in 10 years. Can you come over? Yeah, sure, of course. [ Crying ] Something's happened to Hannah. Oh, my god. I'm on my way. It's working. We're gonna be okay. All right? All right. Oh! Okay. We're getting out of here, all right? Everything's gonna be fine, Hannah. Okay? You all right? Yeah. Don't be scared. I'm gonna go check. They're fine. What's that mean? It means leave them alone. Be careful. I'm gonna check. All right, sweetheart. Come here. Okay. You're gonna be fine, all right? Turn around. Hang on, hang on. [ Crash ] Karen, come on. [ Gasps ] Oh, god! No! No! Go, Hannah! Run! [ Screams ] No, let go of her! No! Don't you hurt her! Please stop! Hannah, run! Run! No! No, please! Please, don't touch me! No! Step down. Step down. Your babysitter made a stupid mistake. If you want to see your mother again, don't you make one. Now, you'll be all right if you cooperate. Do you know what that means? It means do what you say. That's right. You are a very smart girl. Where is she? You better remember what's going on here. She just tried to escape. What was I supposed to do? Let her think she could just walk out of here? Is that what you wanted? How did this whole thing spin out of control? It was your idea. That's how. That... was not my idea. Lucy: So this money was taped underneath the drawer? Rachel: He was hiding it. From the same people who want to get into his safety deposit box? Why underneath the drawer? Maybe he was playing a game of hide and seek with the people who want it. There's these terrible crimes being committed, and the cops don't do anything. Hannah's got to be so scared. What am I gonna do if they hurt her? You just have to do what they say. But I don't have the security card to get into cardoza's safety deposit box. There has to be a way you can do it. Baxter set up the security system so that it can't be done. I know. Come on, you can break the code! You came up with half the system. Maybe if I had days... not hours. Rachel... you have to do it -- for Hannah. He's been dead around two weeks, I'd guess. I'll give you a definitive later today. Too bad. He was a good cop. I knew him when I was first coming in. Sad secret is it's not that unusual for a guy like that to off himself. Newly retired, leaves the job, doesn't know what to do with himself. That's a lesson for you. Get yourself a hobby. Have a life after. [ Cellphone rings ] Hello? I hope you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. I am. Good. Because there's not all that much time left. I want to talk to Hannah. She's fine. I want to talk to her. When we get what we want. I'm gonna find a way to get you what you want, but I want you to know something. If you've done anything to her, if you've touched one hair on her head, I will find you when this is over, you hear me? Anywhere in the world, I will find you! Then get us what we want, then everything will be fine. It's breakfast. Mom says I'm not supposed to eat stuff like this. I don't want it. You eat it, or I'm gonna feed it to you. Man: And if you want to waste more of my time, you know where to find me. I didn't write this. [ Telephone ringing ] Schultz: Rachel? Yes? Come to my office, please. [ Clears throat ] Yes, sir. Right away. When did she die? During the night, I guess. What's the difference? You like having another dead body on your hands? I like not having to worry about another witness. If you were smart, you'd feel the same way. Smart? You smart enough to help me dig? 'Cause whether you like it or not, you and I are in the same hole. Dig. I can take care of that for ya. Just let me see your payment slip. They can't do it. They need it. [ Knock on door ] Here she is. Oh, hi. Come on in. Uh, Rachel, we have a little bit of a situation here. This is assistant district attorney cowen and detective miles. How do you do? These gentlemen need our help. We'd like to search one of your safety deposit boxes. Well, as I'm sure Mr. Schultz has already informed you, bay cities mutual abides by the strictest of privacy policies. I can't allow you to access a client's property without their express verbal consent. How about written approval from a superior court judge? I understand your discretion, but we have a warrant. And we have the customer's access card. Well, that changes things, of course. Just give me the number of the box that you're looking for. That's just the problem. We don't know the number or who it belongs to, but we assume you have ways of tracking ownership. Well, of course. We have a series of redundant security measures. All that we really need for this is a card reader. Rachel, can you handle it for these gentlemen? I have a card reader at my desk, Mr. Schultz. It'll just take me... I just need a few minutes to access the information. We'd appreciate it, miss McKenzie. Excuse me. I'll be right back. What does that mean? I don't understand. [ Keyboard clacking ] [ Clears throat ] [ Telephone rings ] [ Keypad beeping ] [ Lock clicks ] Anything else I can do for you? Hi. How are you? I found it. It belongs to a Raymond cardoza, box 14533. The last time he accessed it was 15 days ago. Raymond cardoza. That's weird. We were in his house this morning. Yeah, that's right. He's been dead at least two weeks, according to the coroner. He must have sent this to me right before he died. Is that significant? Well, to be honest with you, Raymond cardoza was a police officer. There's been an investigation about some dirty cops in the department. Who they are and how they do what they do has been a focus of mine for years. We'd like to get it opened. You can handle that, right, Rachel? I certainly can, sir. Right this way. Um, excuse me. I'm sorry that took so long, sir. Before, when you called, my user I.D. Had locked up when I was testing the security system, so I had to use frank's computer, and he was in the middle of a sensitive document, so it just took a moment for me to access his card reader. Well, that explains the alert. Of course. Okay. Right this way. Thank you. You have to wonder what makes a person kill himself. Who said that he killed himself? No one. I just assumed. Are you saying he was killed? No one said anything about a suicide or a murder. Well, someone sends something to the d.A.'S office that's important, and then he's found dead -- you have to assume you knew he was in danger or that he was gonna kill himself. No? You could have a future in law enforcement. You have to wonder who would kill a police officer in his own home. Maybe another bad cop. Shall we go to a private room? I've always been curious -- if a person had some information regarding a crime, should they go to the police or the d.A.'S office? The police. They would be first. But if the police are dirty, like you say, how could he trust them? Anyone could come to me if he had information about a case. Or he could go to a good cop, like most of them are -- like miles, here. Is there some information you have that is pertinent to what is in this box? I have no idea what's in there. I'll be recording our findings. I need an officer of the bank to witness. That'll be you. Ms. Rachel McKenzie -- witness. The box is empty. Nothing in it at all. Jenny, please take this to the vault for me. Miss McKenzie, as is customary at a time like this, we bestow upon you our cards in the hope that you may magically stumble upon some helpful information. Please, call us if you hear or think of anything, even if it seems insignificant. Of course. We've already taken up enough of your time. All right, then. Good day. You're frank Gordon, right? Yeah. Thank you for letting miss McKenzie use your computer. It really helped us out. Um, sorry? I said thank you for letting miss McKenzie use your computer to access the safety deposit box records. I appreciate it. [ Snorts ] What are you kidding? There's no way I'd let her touch my computer. [ Lock rattles ] You all right? I want to go home. You will. Where's Karen? Don't worry about her. Don't! You're going to get hurt if you try that! I want my mom! Why don't you do yourself and your mom a favor? Just be patient. Your mother doesn't want anything to happen to you, and if she does her job right, you'll be out of here soon. Why would cardoza send me a key to a box with nothing in it? Everybody knows him as the department prankster. I don't know. The bank officer -- she's hiding something. I don't know what. I don't know if it has to do with cardoza's box. I just know it's something. It's possible she got in the box first before we got here and took out whatever was there. Maybe this woman's involved in what's going on. Whatever these cops are doing, there's money involved. Maybe she's helping them launder it. You want me to look around? Yes, and I don't care if she knows about it. She's the kind that might spook. [ Sighs ] Whatever's on this memory card came from cardoza. Where are they? [ Knock on door ] That's your cut. You're short. [ Gasps ] Just...executed them. Hey, insurance pays a target for the car being stolen. We get to sell the car parts back east. Everybody's happy. Dude, we should've gone into business. I did. Hey, we're moving into a whole new area. Big bucks now. Man: Like what? You know anyone good in evidence? Yeah, if the price is right? Money's not a problem. What we need are clean goods. Yeah, I think I know the right guy. He knows the right guy. You know the right guy? That assistant d.A. Was right. Cardoza was involved with dirty cops. He was a surveillance expert. He made these videos to expose them. And to confess his own guilt. Maybe that's who has Hannah and Karen. This evidence could put them away forever. Cardoza had an attack of morality when he found out he was dying. Yeah, somehow they found out about the safety deposit box. Cardoza was already dead. They're the ones who searched his house. And found out he did his banking at bay cities. Yup. And when Baxter died, I inherited them along with this job. They took Hannah and Karen to force me to get this for them. What are you gonna do? What am I gonna do? I'm gonna get this to them. And then I'm gonna get Hannah back...And Karen... And try to forget this whole thing ever happened. I've been thinking about something, but it's not right to ask you to help. Ask me. I'm thinking about a plan. A backup for when they call me to meet them. Are you kidding? I'll do whatever you want. Brought you lunch. I told you, my mom doesn't let me eat that stuff. You know, I'm getting sick of listening to your spoiled mouth. Your mother should've taught you some manners. Now, you eat it and shut up. I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! That was stupid, little girl. Really stupid. Not good. Glen: Hey, partner, get in here! What? I spoke to my guy in the d.A.'S office. Yeah? Cardoza sent cowen the card key. They got into the box. It's over, man. Relax. It was empty. They found nothing. Nothing? What? What is that, a joke? Maybe cardoza didn't have anything on us after all. No, we know he did. The worm called us before he died. It's a game. All the medication, maybe his brain was playing tricks on him. The guy knows he's gonna die. He gets religion. Wants to meet his maker on the right foot. There's two possibilities. The d.A. Found something, but they're keeping it secret under lock and key, or Rachel did what we told her to do. She got to the box first, and whatever's in it, she has, which is why cowen found nothing. Look, the bank's closed. Her time's up. Oh, god! Why the hell don't they call? Maybe they're figuring out the perfect place to meet. They don't even know I have it yet. [ Cellphone rings ] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Hello? You got something? Yeah. Can I talk to Hannah now, please? Did you get it from the box? Yeah, I said I got it. Where do I take it? Just tell me how to get it to you. I want to see my mother! I hear Hannah. Please, I need to talk to her. Put her on the phone now! In exactly 45 minutes, you get into your car, and you go to a1 hardware on 7th and elm. Do you know where that is? I'll find it. I need to know that she's all right. Go into the store, browse the light bulbs, you come alone. You make sure no one is following you if you want to see your daughter in one piece again. Someone will meet you. How will I know you? We'll know you. [ Whimpers ] Smells like a trap. If the d.A.'S office is involved, why would they say the box is empty? How would I know? Maybe they got to her. Let her carry the ball. It's not their style. All right, what do you want to do? Hey. You guys still working on that cardoza case? Yeah. Why? 'Cause we got a call of a suspicious vehicle parked in front of his house the other night. Call from who? Mrs. Fenster. Who's Mrs. Fenster? Serial paranoid, calls in at least once a week worried about a car parked on her street. And, being the good public servants we are, we track down each one. But I thought since cardoza's place was across from her, it might be worth looking into. Good. Thanks. Sure. Rachel McKenzie. She was there, at cardoza's. She is involved. [ Telephone rings ] Assistant district attorney cowen's office. This is detective miles. Is cowen there? One moment. It's a detective miles. I'll take it. Hey. Is that right? Yeah, right away. Good work. Less than an hour. Okay. Write this up. We need a fast search warrant. Can you read it? "Rachel McKenzie -- 6226 Crescent." Uh, y-yeah. Right. Step on it. We might've caught a break. Who's on call? It's judge canter, isn't it? Yes. [ Cellphone rings ] Yep. They made the girl. You sure? Cowen just asked me to submit a warrant request for her residence. Yes, I'm sure. How long can you drag this out? I can't. He put a rush on it. They want the warrant signed and sealed within the hour. [ Cellphone beeps ] You sure you want to do this? I'm gonna slap you if you ask me that again. Okay. Remember to wait three minutes. [ Tires screech ] [ Gasps ] Drive and don't slow down. I've got a gun pointed at the back of your seat. If you don't do exactly as I tell you, I'll blow you through the windshield. I'll do whatever you say. Where's Hannah and Karen? Shut up. Keep going straight here. Okay. Who's that following us? What? Nobody. Who'd you tell? Nobody, I swear. I didn't tell anyone! That car was in front of your house. She's just my friend. She just stopped by. I didn't tell her anything. If you're playing a game with me... I'm not, I swear! I'm not! ...i swear to you, it'll cost your daughter her life. Did you say anything to her? No, I didn't say anything. Because she'll die if you did. I didn't! You're lying. No, I'm not! I'm not lying! Turn here. What? Left, take a left. You had a little plan, did you? Have someone follow us? I don't know what you're talking about. Save it. I know you're lying. Make a u-turn. Take out your cellphone and call her. When I tell you to do something, do it! [ Cellphone rings ] Lucy. Rachel? Now you tell her not to follow us unless she wants to be responsible for both your and your daughter's death. And if she says anything to anybody, we'll call it in. Lucy, don't do anything or he'll kill us! Lucy, just go home and don't say anything to anyone. Please. That's enough. Let's go. [ Siren wails ] Parker, round back. Yes, sir. [ Doorbell ringing ] Come on. Rachel McKenzie?! Miss McKenzie, we have a search warrant that allows us to examine the premises. Anything? No, sir. All right. Let's break it in. Mark it -- 4:15. All right, look around -- anything related to law enforcement, anything related to ray cardoza, anything that looks suspicious. Take it. Get out. Where are we? Where are we? I told you to shut up. Is this where Hannah is? Are Hannah and Karen here? Walk. Keep walking. Steps. Step, step. Step up. Again, step up. Get in, sit down. Detective, here you go. Thanks. So what do we got? We found about 15 grand in hundreds lying on the table. 15 grand? It's a payoff. I knew she was involved somehow. Maybe. I'm not sure. Where is she? Don't know. Maybe she's on the run, got scared when we came to the bank. No. The money's here. Clothes, suitcases -- everything but them. I don't know what's going on, but it looks like they expect to be back. Tried her cell? 10 times -- no answer, just her message. [ Sighs ] [ Telephone rings ] Hello? Is this Lucy? Who is this? Detective miles, police department. Yes, this is Lucy Madrid. You haven't found her, have you? I mean, um... She isn't dead, is she? Who? Rachel McKenzie? Yes, yes. Isn't that why you're calling? Did they hurt her? Did they hurt Hannah? No, we haven't found her yet. I saw them. I saw pictures of them. I know she copied them on her computer. Miss Madrid, we're gonna need you to come down to the Fowler police station. We need your help. Okay, I'll do whatever you need. Anything come up on the computer yet? No. When we're done, have one of our guys bring it back to my office. Someone on the detail should be able to crack it, see what's on it. [ Sighs ] All right. What? I don't know. I've seen a lot of perps. This woman, Rachel, doesn't make sense -- wrong type. I mean, you take the money-- if I went according to type, a lot of bad guys would be walking the street instead of being put away. It's just an instinct. If she's involved, it's not as a perp. Maybe, but we're close to something with her. All right, leave somebody here in case she comes home and we find out she's been out to a movie and ice cream with her daughter and likes to leave a lot of money where people can admire it. I've been a prosecutor nine years. I'll tell you one thing -- everybody's guilty of something. What you found in the box? Yeah. It's a memory stick. Where is it? It's in my purse. It's in my wallet in my purse -- inside, in a little pocket. It's right there, behind her picture. That stinking worm. Is that it? Yeah. Did you see what's on it? No. What's on it? I don't know. Photographs? I don't know! She's lying. No, I'm not. No. Why do I care what's on that? I just wanted to get it like you told me to and get my daughter back, that's all. You weren't curious? No. All I care about is getting my daughter back. Can't you understand that? I'm telling you, she's lying. She had someone follow us. No, I didn't know that she was gonna follow. I didn't know. She's just a friend of mine. She doesn't know anything. She didn't see anything. You have masks on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Please, just give me my daughter back! Where did you get these? They came to the bank -- cowen and miles. They had cardoza's key to the safety deposit box. So you let them see the box? They had the key. I had no choice. But I got to it first. I did. They never saw the memory stick, I swear to you! They didn't. When I took them to the box, it was empty. What about the security cameras? There are no security cameras in the viewing rooms. It's a privacy measure. And you found this underneath the safety deposit box? Yeah. I almost didn't find it myself. And you didn't tell them? No. Nothing. They don't know anything about this. Please let me see Hannah. Please. Don't tell me you believe that. She wouldn't tell anyone. Is she that stupid? Please? Can I have my daughter now, please? Stop your crying. Hannah? Mom? Hannah! Mom! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah, it's mommy. I'm here. Mom. Hannah? Hannah, mommy's here, honey. Mommy's right here. Mommy! [ Sobbing ] I didn't eat what they wanted me to, mommy. I knew you wouldn't want me to. That's good, honey. That's my good girl. Oh. Did they hurt you? No. [ Sniffles ] Where's Karen? Karen had an accident. They hurt her, mommy. Okay, Hannah. We're just gonna have to find Karen later, then. We can go now, right? You're gonna let us leave. You don't know us. This never happened. If we hear -- and we would -- that somebody said anything to anyone, we will find you. We just want to go home. You're kidding, right? I'll take them to a safe drop-off. You hear that, Hannah? We're going home. There's just one problem. The kid -- she saw my face. She pulled off the mask... ...and saw me. [ Sighs ] How could you let this happen? W-w-wait. You didn't really see him, though, right, Hannah? I didn't mean to pull it off. I made a copy! What? I looked at what was on that memory stick. It is videos. Cardoza took them, and I saw them. I saw all of you and what you've done, and I made a copy on my computer. That was not very smart. I backed it up. It's gonna be in the bank system Monday morning, and only I have the password to stop it. Well, I think I know a way to make you give us that password. You touch her, I swear to you, you will never get that password. You hear me? Because then I won't care! I think she's bluffing. I saw you with guns in your hands and men down on the floor. I saw you kill people. I saw you with all that money. I saw you -- both of you. And cardoza confessed because he knew he was gonna die. Doesn't mean she made a backup. She'd say anything right now. Believe me, I'm telling you the truth. But I will delete it if you just let us go. We just want things to go back to normal. That's all. You're cops. I saw that on the video. You're cops. You're supposed to protect people. Isn't that what you sworn to do? To help? Please...just let us go. Mommy, I want to go home. It's okay, honey. We're gonna be okay. Okay. What's there to talk about? We get rid of them, go to her house, destroy the computer -- we're in the clear. You were followed, right? What are we supposed to do about her? We don't even know who she is. This whole thing -- it all started as a way to make a little extra income, a hobby that makes money. Now it's an excuse for homicide. Anybody I took care of, I had to -- to protect us. That's just it. We shouldn't be protecting ourselves. We should be protecting people like the mother and the kid. Well, I'm not gonna let them bring me down. We were good cops. Remember how we started out? That was a long time ago. I know. What ever happened to those guys? One of them got buried when they suspended me for trying to do my job. [ Cellphone rings ] Hello? They brought Rachel McKenzie's computer in here. Wha-- how did that happen? I don't know. A detective named miles called, and then this shows up. Get rid of it. What are you talking about? I'm talking $10,000. You're talking about $20,000. Fine, $20,000. Just do it! Yes, sir. We're in the clear. Logan's gonna destroy Rachel's computer. Whoever followed you can't I.D. You. Those two -- they just want life to return to how it was two days ago. We're all right. I'm gonna go catch my shift. Don't want to do anything to raise suspicion. You really believe that? We're gonna be okay? [ Chuckles ] Come on. Don't do anything stupid. Like what? We may need them for any number of reasons -- not the least of which might be as a plea bargain. They'll be of no use to us if they're dead. You know what the bad guys say -- the best witness is a dead one. We're not the bad guys. I'll be waiting right here with my hands in my pockets. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Shh. Here, take this. [ Wood clatters ] Shh. Go get something we can use. Okay, good. Come on. Okay, get all this stuff. Go. Where have you been? Uh, s-sorry. I must have got some bad clams for lunch. Did a uniform bring an evidence laptop here? Uh, i-i-i don't know. Where is it now? Okay, I-I will find it. Get me that uniform! Damn crooks around here! Damn! Anyone? No. [ Sighs ] What about this group? [ Sighs ] Um, see that guy over by the counter with the gray suit? Yeah. He's one of them. You're sure? That's him. [ Sighs ] Thank you. Hey, Glen. You got a second? Hey. Sure. Anything I can help you with? Yeah, I hope, I hope. Let's go talk where we can get some privacy. Can it wait? I got a b&e I got to chase. Actually, no. It's kind of important. It's about cardoza and Rachel McKenzie. Oh. Old cardoza, huh? That sounds, um, interesting. Maybe later. Stop him! Stop him! Hold it right there! I got to read you your rights, Glen. Sorry, man. Yeah, I know. It's the job. Where's the mother and the kid? Come on, now. Do the right thing for yourself. Someone's watching them. Who? Cash. Where? Come on, you know how dangerous he can be. Route 32. 12-mile marker. Old house -- south side of the street. Take him. You, you -- you two, come with me! Okay, got it! Run, let's go! Hurry! Go! Car keys, we need the car keys! Mom! Oh, good. Okay. Let's go, come on! Run! Come on. Run, honey, run! Let's go! Get in, get in! Mom, come on! Ugh. Hannah! Get out! Run, Hannah! Run, Hannah! Just run! Leave my mommy alone! I'll shoot! You know how to use that, sweetheart? But I do. What do you think you're gonna do? I'll kill you... If you come any closer. Oh, yeah? We're leaving here now. No, I can't let that happen. We're gonna get in this Van, and we're gonna drive away! Well, first, you've got the safety on. If I did, you wouldn't be moving so slow. You up for this? I don't think so. Come on. Get in the car. In the car. [ Siren wailing ] Give me the gun. It's all over now, Rachel. Hannah. Mom. Is she all right? Honey? I'm all right. Okay. I just want to go home. It's where we're going, honey. We're going home. Okay. Hello, Rachel. Something I can help you with, gentlemen? We need to check your e-mails, frank. Why? I only have business communications on this computer. You -- you know that. [ Gunshots ] What? How did that get on there? I... That's it. Finally, what I've been looking for. I'm so, so sorry, Maggie. She's a beautiful girl. She was a wonderful person. I'll never forget her. Oh, sweetie. Now, I have some fruit. Want some of these? Oh, cool. And some sandwiches. Are you just gonna eat pretzels? I don't know. Here are a couple plates. Mom makes the best. You're on a pretzel diet. [ Giggles ] Miles: Hello, hello. Oh, hey! Hey.
