IS LUCYNA A GIRL? Directed by Juliusz Gardan Engineer or not? My, my... you're so much in love with that engineer of yours. They're here! Engineer arrived! Bravo! Mesdames et Messieurs... Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, no more student jokes! In front of you stands graduated engineer Lucyna Bortnowska. Silence! Tomorrow I'm leaving Paris. I'm returning to Poland. So, let me serve you a champagne for goodbye. Gaudeamus igitur Juvenes dum sumus Gaudeamus igitur Juvenes dum sumus - Miss engineer... - Excuse me, I was first. Blondes don't have the right to speak. Don't argue. You can both talk. Miss engineer... "I'm asking for your hand!" One too fat, the other too thin. And I don't intend to marry. I want to work like my father. You know, my father once was an ordinary locksmith, and today... he is a big industrialist! Louis Wesse, Motor Company Detroit, USA. We accept the project for improved valves. We handed 20 000 dollars to Westminster Bank in Paris. Halo, Polish Ram Building Works, yes, prezident Bortnowski speaking. - Lunch is ready? - Yes, Mr. Prezident. But Ms. Countess ordered to serve it when she tells it. Hm... Yes... - And where's my sister? - Ms. Countess is in her apartment. Baptysta, what is for lunch today? Haricots verts sauce mousseline, Bouchées à la reine, Brochettes à La Rochefoucauld Côtes d'agneau sauce soubise, Poularde St-Michel, Compote de prunelles au Marasquin, Fromage divers, Moka, Liqueur. For the ear a lot, for the stomach - not! Baptysta, give me the magnifier, I can't hit it with my fork. I haven't eaten such delicious food for a long time. Maybe you have but it's hard to recall such trifles. Well said, trifles. Not quantity, but quality is important. Why's this pancake so weak? That's not pancake Mr. Prezident, it's a telegram. "I'm coming tomorrow. Lucynka" Beloved Lucynka... Tomorrow? Mon dieu! Why is she informing us in the last moment? Let me see! Of course. No time of arrival, nor which train she took. And nothing is ready for her arrival. When will I prepare her room? I've had it enough. He has a free time, he'll gladly help. I'd be delighted. You see? He'll even be delighted. In that case, I'll vanish. I have an important conference in the city. Goodbye. Of course, he doesn't care about anything and I have to do it all by myself. Restaurant Pork chop is fine Mr. Prezident? And cabbage? Mhmmm... Fine. Yes, yes, yes... Tomorrow we'll prepare a special dish. Roasted tongues! Finger lickin' good! Good. I love tongues so much. It's her! Imagine that, she didn't come by this train as well. - It's dreadful, this waiting. - Maybe she'll come tomorrow. - Maybe this is her. - Maybe! Ah, it's nanny. - How are you, Malgosia? - I'm very happy Mr. Prezident. Malgorzata, no one was asking you... Old fool... Ahem, hm... What's this? What do you want, mister? Lucynka! Daddy! Aunt! Ah, nanny! The whole family together! You've grown so much. I wouldn't recognize you... - I'm finally with you. - Lucynka.... ...but, how do you look like that? I was little late and I drove with an open top. You came by car all alone? But of course! By car, from Paris, all by herself... But aunty, I'm a grown up woman, and in addition, an engineer. An engineer, a girl from a good home and in such clothing! All that has to change now. I'll take care of you. Lucynka, Lucynka... Don't cross your legs. Sorry but I have to go to the cabinet, I have some more work to do. Excuse me. And he's already gone. It's always like that. Yes, yes I know. I have to be around, accept guests, and marry a prince or a millionaire. And tomorrow the golden youth is coming for a dinner party... - Where are you going? - To talk with father. But why? About what? - Daddy, I want to talk with you. - Please, be my guest. - Okay? - Yes, please. What's that? A sausage! Sssh, aunt will hear you. Nice, I'm hungry too, you know. See kid, I manage as I can. - Aunt Renata will starve us to death. - Yes. - But we will not surrender. - You think so? We won't. Come, I'll show you my arsenal. - Say what? - Extraordinary! Good day to you. Amadeus Maria, I was thinking of you a minute ago. At last, for once, because until now... Oh, you ungrateful... I wanted you to meet my niece. Nothing urgent. I beg your pardon, maybe next time. I mean... Today... I took all my courage, and after all these years I yearn to decisively speak with you. Countess... You know I can't stand favoritism. And your only daughter, do you love her? But this is a nephew of my beloved nanny. Okay, okay. What can he do, that protege of yours? - He finished higher technical school. - What's his name? Kwiatkowski... Julian. Here. Let him report to director Braun with this. Please come in. To whom? Director Braun. Director Braun is busy. What is it about? I came for a job. A job? This is not an employment office. - But I... - What "you"? There is no exception. But still... Please go and do not disturb me while I'm working. But I have to talk with director Braun. Director Braun does not have to. - And besides... - What besides? - You use a lousy powder. Your face will peel off like a snake skin. How rude! How dare you to talk like that, mister.... Mister... Kwiatkowski at your service. Julian Kwiatkowski. - Insolently rude... - And stubborn. I won't go. So please sit there by the wall and you can wait 'till the judgement day. Miss Dotunia... - Can you rewrite this letter for me? - Soon. Well, it doesn't have to be right away, my angel. If my princess doesn't want to do it now... And you? What do you want? Prezident Bortnowski sent me. I have his recommendation letter. Prezident sent you.... - What do you need, sir? - I need to see Mr. Zarnowski. You're in the right place. Khm, khm... Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, Mister! Who the hell is singing sharply like that? - Are you engineer Zarnowski? - Yes. - Nice to meet you. - Hey, hey, hey... What kind of stupid joke is this? - What do you want? - I want to introduce myself. - My name is Julian Kwiatkowski. - Zarnowski. What else? But speak quickly because I don't have time. Me neither. Here you are. I made myself a job... So, you came for practice? Under my tutelage? - Do I look like a teacher? - More like a chimney man. Thanks for a compliment. - What can you do? - Almost nothing. That's enough for a start. Did you study? 20 years in a school of life. - And besides that? - University of technology. - What do I have to do? - For now, don't be a wretch. - And later? - Spit and then catch. And lunch break? You can observe even during the break but you won't understand a lot. But maybe... - What are you working on? - An invention. What kind? A machine for throwing out the uninvited guests through the window. - Dammit. - What's going on? Why do you care? It doesn't start. How can it start when the splitter is on the frame, not on the distributor. Really. I'm such a fool. - You know, mister... - Kwiatkowski Yes, Kwiatkowski - You're not as stupid as you look like. - Thank you for the compliment. Oh yes. Great. Perfectly. You see, I made here a new oil pump. But it doesn't work, and I can't find what's the problem. Kwiatkowski, take the apron and let's go to work. Okay? - Okay. - Then quick. - Okay. We're finishing, Kwiatkowski. - Okay. You're all covered in resin. You are looking dirty yourself too. What are you combining? Wash yourself. Take off your clothes. Are you ashamed? There are no women here. How can I know that? Maybe there are? You can make the whole factory laugh by how this guy washes himself. That's how a cat washes itself. I'll do it proper at my place. Oh, at home? So, mummy will wash up her little son? You're a capable guy but delicate as a girl. Leave me be. I can be elegant and have a lots of women too. But I won't. I like to be on good terms with you, boss. This is very kind from you, assistant. Halo, Tunia? Yes, I've finished. I too am free. Thank you for thinking about me. But dear, I can't now, on the phone. Besides I'm not alone. Okay, see you soon, in front of the entrance. But don't grumble because I'll be angry with you. Bye. - Miss, at last! - How are you nanny, how are you? Oh Miss, I was so much worried about you. My gosh... Whole day among the people walking dressed as a man. - If only the Director knew... - But you won't tell him. I would rather cut my tongue. But it doesn't fit for a girl to parade in men's clothes. But all the female film stars wear trousers in the west. But they're artists. And girl from a decent home... But it's only for a few days, Nanny. Not only that I stood up on my own feet in dad's factory but I've met a guy, Nanny. - A fine one. - A guy? I'll tell you later. Now I have to go because we have guests at home. You're charming. One would spend the whole life with you. Miss Lucynka is lucky with the guys. Where has the director disappeared? My brother had to leave us. He has an important meeting again. Miss Lucyna. You're charming. One would spend the whole life with you. Is this a proposal? Excuse me, Countess. Is Lucyna talking with count Rwensky? No. It's prince Sagayo. - You'd spent your life with me? - Yes. - But I advise you to think about it. - But why? But please, keep this a secret. Finally, you found some time for us too. Lucynka, my child, why are you having such a tragic face? - Can I say a farewell to you? - So early? Unfortunately, I have urgent things to do. I'm sorry. My respects. - Can I say a farewell to you? - Before the dinner? I'm really desperate. - My respects. - Good night. - Farewell, Countes. - You too? - Unfortunately, we have to go. - My respects. I don't get it. Everyone left. What happened? I don't understand. As if everyone arranged to go. - What's with her? - I told everyone that... - What? - That father went bankrupt. Give me the cloth. Wrench. Not this, that one. Why are you staring like that? - Because I'm thinking. - About her? No, about him. About him? About the tailor who's doing me a suit for Sunday. - And today's already Saturday. - As usual before Sunday. Nice joke. Today I'm finishing earlier and going for a drink. - Alone? - No, with someone. I have a date with someone. With whom? Curiosity is a step before the marriage. And you cannot be there because you're already in a marriage. You're reminding me of that all the time. Well, well. Don't get angry, don't get sulky. Therefore I'm free in the evening so we can go for a dance. Okay? With the greatest pleasure. I'm waiting for your call at 8 o'clock. Bye. Bye. - Mister Stefan. - Miss Tunia. Let me introduce you. Mister Julian Kwiatkowski, my new colleague. We know each other already. Yes. You came with the letter of recommendation from the director himself. I was in a bad mood then but you made a good impression then. I felt that. Stefan, shall we take mister Kwiatkowski with us? Well... I don't know if he has the time and will. - Of course. I do. - Yes? But it will take a couple of hours. No problem. Yes. But they will worry about you at your home. Probably not. I'll change my clothes in a second. I'll be ready in one hour. And mister Kwiatkowski will wait with you. Okay? So goodbye. Okay then. Let's go to my place. So, this is my place. Make yourself at home. I'm going to change clothes and take something to eat. Okay, no problem. I'll wait. How do you like my apartment? It's nice, sure. Ah, yes. I see you liked Miss Tunia. And you? I think so... Love? So-so. But, is this so-so in general or rather that marital so-so? O, marital, marital. Who knows if ever will be such a woman that will make me so so-so that I would marry her. Probably... If I find such a woman that I will fall in love with her Okay, okay I'll be forever faithful to her I won't make her sad nor cry Oh yes, oh yes I'll be faithful to her like a dog I'll hold her in my hands I'll leave everything for her I'll do everything for her But all this if I find such a woman that I will fall in love with her Okay, okay She'll be like in heaven. Tragedy, tragedy... - But Kwiatkowski, how do you hit? - Yes? - Not like that. Be careful... - Yes? Carefully! Like this. But it's not a big deal. It's just for training. But I say that you'd like to box a little. Would you like to spar with me? Yeah, I could. I'll give you one hand. Okay. Be careful. Because I hit hard. Yeah, hard. Hard, yeah. Leave me, goddamit. It hurts! You are a strange fellow. It's Tunia. Let's go! Sorry for waiting, Tunia. No, Kwiatkowski. Yours is the seat. Just quick. - One more. - No, two. Three! Oh, this one's great! He's good, isn't he? Great! Enough of this. Let's go swimming. Okay. Here we can take off our clothes. Tunia, you go there. We'll stay here. Do you swim good? As a fish! Then we'll do 100 meters. Great! Although, in fact... What, are you afraid? - No, but... - But what? I don't have a swimming suit. Oh, rubbish. We can swim naked there. Tunia will swim here. We'll go there. There's no one there. But my doctor said I shouldn't. Lungs probably. Yeah, lungs. Who would have think of. Such a healthy skin color and has a problem with chest. Chest exactly. Unfortunately. Sit then by the water and count clouds. And we'll go swimming. Go, I'll be there. The water is warm. Tunia, I give up. Let's swim there, c'mon. Tunia! Give me the coat. And where did he go? He swam away. Don't be afraid. What goes around, comes around. Dry my back, please. Not that rough, you need to be delicate with women. - You're obviously inexperienced. - Obviously. Thank you. Please, sit down here. Closer. Don't be afraid. My God, you're really shy. - And where's Stefan? - He excels at long distances. And he likes it, wet. - Very enjoyable sport. - And flirting isn't a sport for you? I don't know- And if you don't see Stefan it means he isn't there. If you ask me, you're the most suitable replacement. - Don't exaggerate. - What a marvelous lips you have. - Hey Miss, you know... - I know, I know, you're a naughty boy. Please, please, give me a kiss. - Oh, Stefan. - Isn't coming back. But he actually is. I see you were longing for him to come. I washed myself for all time. - C'mon Mr. Kwiatkowski. - Where? Into the bush. Why? Because Tunia won't change clothes in front of you. To tell the truth, you're a total nerd, but still a male. C'mon, c'mon. Kwiatkowski... Yes. What's up? Come here. I want to tell you something. I'm listening. Come here. I have a secret request for you, and I can't yell. Here I am. What is it about? You are a man and you will understand. On our way to the city you try to disappear somehow, okay? I have to stay with Tunia alone, get it? To a smart head you don't repeat twice. What are you doing? We had to spend evening together. We had to but I forgot that I have a manicure and a bath in the schedule. Then cancel it. Not possible, my podiatrist would get mad. You're lying, shamelessly lying, I see it in your eyes. You arrogant... Come on, Kwiatkowski. I'll drop you off. I'll tell you. All women are worthless. Oh, holy truth. Shall we drink some vodka? Vodka? Ah this Kiepura, marvelous, marvelous singer he is. Halo? Yes... Lucynka? Is this you? How? You're not at home? No, aunty. I'm not at home for sure. I'm at the party that is held by some other family. What's with you? I'm pretty hi,... but becoming quite sick. Lucyna! What's happening with her? Lucyna! - Halo! Halo! - Halo? Who's speaking? I don't understand. "Dancing Eldorado" here. What? Eldorado? She's in Eldorado. Baron, what's Eldorado? - A night club. - A night club?! Lucynka in a night club. - Baptysta! - I'm here. - Where's Mr. Prezident? - He hasn't come yet. But of course! When you need him, he's not there. What are you staring at? Go away! I will have to go there to get her. Baron, you have to go with me to that Eldorado. I would like to watch a bull fight, but I have to go home, to my aunt. She won't run away. Unless it's some very young aunty. Why? She's old. All the more you don't have to go. Besides Kwiatkowski, you have to be careful with women. All women are worthless. All? All. Tunia also. She has to be the number... - Which? - How could I know? You know, this Tunia or tuna... No. Too nigh. How too? You too? Me too? But no, sir. - Me do, sir. - But what do you do? - I'm telling you. - Wait a second. We can't agree because you speak too much. - Ok. - Let's drink Bruderschaft. It's not tasty but I'll survive. Let's do it. Mmmmm. - Okay. - And now... - I'm Stefan. - I'm Luc... What? Lucifer came up with my name. I'm Julek. According to tradition, now we'll cross snouts. Wait, wait... What's with these women's moves? - Like a man! - Like a man. Listen Julek. You kiss like a girl. Or maybe you are a girl. I don't what are you talking about but it's not correct. All righty. What's that? I don't use that. Do you want to dance? Why are you behaving like that? How? I'm sorry, sir. Oh, nothing.... - Let's drink. - But we already did. Let's kiss then. Julek are you crazy? Let's drink, okay. What's he doing? Nothing. He went crazy. They're after me. Where should I hide? In the toilet. - Who's that? - Oh, I'm sorry. Aw, it's awfully hot. Baron, Lucyna's not here. Maybe there's other room as well. Go and check it. I'll do it. - A table for two? - No thanks. And where's that puppy, Kwiatkowski? You're right. Kwiatkowski, come! Kwiatkowski! Hey, mister... Maybe that was a Prague ratter? Kwiatkowski! - Cheers! - Cheers! Dear sir, what are you doing? Okay. Do not sit down. - Whoa! - Baron! Whoa! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! You're dishonouring me! I didn't pay for a ride. I don't know how to thank you. It'll be enough if I may kiss this beautiful hand. I'm happy because you made me happy. Yes? Here is my saviour. Zarnowski. - de Witz. - Aha. Have you seen Lucyna? Unfortunately I haven't. You have a meeting with someone? She's probably at home already. Let's go then. No, no. I can't let you go. We will never be young again like tonight. Oh, there. A free table. Madame, please. Sir. Excuse me. Such a nice boy. Countess... I haven't lived like this in a long time. Where's my coat? It's lost somewhere. - Baron... - I'll find it right away. C'mon then, right now. - Give me my hat please. - Wow, what a coincidence. Good evening Mr. Julek. Good evening. You know each other already. This is Kwiatkowski. This is general director's protege. You just came, right? No, I'm leaving. Stay with us a bit. We're taking you with us. True, Mr. Director? Let me drink in the name of the prettiest madam in our circle. I almost believe you. Believe, it doesn't hurt. - Found. - Thanks God. Sit down Mr. Nerdy. - My name is de Wit. - Ok, we're quit. How? C'mon, why are you hiding? Mr. Director, a table? - Do you have a reservation? - No. - Perfect, we have something, here. - Oh, how funny you look. Here, be our guest. Menu? I would prefer if you looked at me. Put this off. So, you're interested in all of the women. All of them. But in some of them especially. But you know me so little. Countess, you already drank too much. Please don't bother me. You're... I know, old geezer. Old geezer is ready to rock today. Miss Tunia, I'm sick of these jokes. If you don't dismiss this toyboy right away, I'll leave you immediately. Have a pleasant leave. Director went away. Are we good without him? We... we, Mr. Prezident. Please, come to Eldorado right away. This is awful. Miss Renata. She's alive. She's alive. She's not in the form anymore. Are you always so silent? No, only at night. What beautiful roses. Let me please... Bouquet. Excuse me. I see you are about to sit, baron. I have a little surprise for you. They're so good to me! One brings flowers, the other one surprises. Stefan! What a surprise. I've searched for you in all the cafes. I had a bad conscience. Good to know because it's cute. And I have doubted in you. You don't trust this. You don't trust me after all these proofs of love? Tunia, I'm sorry. Jealousy, it's jealousy. But Stef, you know I only love you. - And besides you... - And besides you no one! And you have flowers too. Give me a kiss. And where is my admirer? He left and won't come back. I have to search for him. What's that? You? You gave my flowers to some bimbo! Oh, I'm sorry. She's not a bimbo. This is... This is... What is this? This is my fiancee. What? It's like that unfortunately. I didn't mean to say unfortunately. We'll have a wedding soon. Evil. You wouldn't believe how happy I am. I didn't know we'll get married. - Who? - We. We? That's rubbish. I had to say it to get rid of this crazy grandma. - Oh, it's like that? - Yes. I'm sick of it. First went away. Second went away. And the third is empty. - C'mon. Let's go. - In a moment, just a second. Miss Renata! Go away Kwiatkovski. Go away with this clothes. Go away with this trousers. I'm a woman and I'll get him, even if he has a heart of ice. Who the hell that might be? One can't have peace even on Sunday. Who's there? Excuse me, is Julek Kwiatkovski here? - No, who's asking? - His sister. Sister? Wait a minute. Wait, I'm coming. - Are you engineer Zarnowski? - Yes. - I wanted to know... - Please come in. Thank you very much. - So, you are... - Julek's sister, yes. He never told me he had one. - You're probably twins. - You're right. We look alike. Well yes. But not to mention such a sister. - Such? - Such a mesmerizing! - Please, have a seat. - Thank you. - I could also have a seat. - Of course, please. - You're so much alike. - But we have different characters. - Oh, but Julek is such a golden child. - And I'm exact opposite. I don't believe you. You're even more gracious. Strange, but I feel like we already know each other and as if I was already mesmerized by you for some time. Mister engineer, I didn't come here for compliments. But for what then? Oh, I'm sorry. A sudden blackout. - I came because of Julek. - God bless him. Julek disappeared yesterday, like a stone in a water. Water? Did he drown? What are you talking about? - A boy disappeared. - We have to call the police. - I'll call them. - Wait. We have to exam the facts first. Well, I know for a fact that you have beautiful eyes. Mister engineer, please be serious. - Where could he be? - He got drunk and didn't come home. You got him drunk. Me? I don't put vodka even in my mouth. And how do you know that then? I've heard him arranging a meeting with a colleague. This colleague has to be a real smartass. Some dark type fellow. A bad influencer. Is it possible to spend a whole night around bars, drinking? - Yes, yes... Indeed. - A drinker. Alcoholic. You're such a static man, Julek's boss. And you let that happen. Me? I did not! B-b-b-b... But that toddler... What's with you? - You're ill probably. - No, nothing like that. - You're shaking. - Me? Here, here's tablets for headache. It was temporary. Now I feel totally healthy. I'm happy and satisfied. - Because Julek is gone? - No, because I find you. I feel as if I'm in love. - With your fiancee? - My fi...? - But who told you? - You did. Did I? When? - Maybe I've misheard it. - But of course. Do you like this person? I used to like her... Before. But now... And now... Are you against marriage? There are lots of good women, and lots of bad. It's hard to find the right one. The perfect one. You search for her and find her one day. She's good, pretty and has a good heart. And then you adore her. If I find such a woman that I will fall in love with her - Okay, okay. - Then what? I'll be forever faithful to her. I won't make her sad nor cry - For sure? - Oh yes. Oh yes. I'll be faithful to her like a dog I'll hold her in my hands I'll leave everything for her That's too much. I will steal sun's shine for her, Of course, if I find such a woman, whom I will love Okay, okay, it will be like in heaven for her. Miss Lucyna! - Miss Lucyna. - Mister Waron, have a seat. - I wanted to talk to you. - I'm listening. I would gladly listen to the end the song that you're whistling. I'm listening. Miss Lucyna... Miss Lucyna. Love... ...can takeover any man's heart. O yes... - Without announcement. - O yes. - It's hard to defend from it. - O yes. Because of that. I have a great honour to propose your hand. You? Yes, me. What do you say? She's whistling. That's a good sign. What are you daydreaming about, baron? About her. And I daydream about him. About me? No, no about you, baron... About marvelous boy I met at the dance. Such a beautiful boy. Good day to you. Oh, hello. Finally the lost one has been found. I should pinch your ears actually. But when I see you my heart goes soft. You're so similar to that amazing sister of yours. Why didn't you tell me you have such a treasure at home? Treasure? Really? A girl like any else. Mesmerizing. Boring to death. All day yesterday I hear: Mister Stefan, Mister Stefan... Really? She was talking about me? She was, she was. But I also told her what a mess you are. You're such a swine. My dear, my sister is not some Tunia that you can play on with fake engagement. And then leave because other things appeared. - But Julek, listen, I... - Listen and remember, my sister is not average, she is a fair and honourable person. Considering your sister I have completely honest intentions. Let them be the most honest, I will not allow it that some bachelors come to me here. But I tell you nanny, there's nothing wrong with it. Careful with a man, my child, you never know what's he like. What is he like? Great, kind, cute. Oh, look. I almost forget to put off my bracelet. And you said you have honest intentions. That's only he wouldn't guess who I was. Listen nanny, you're my aunt and I'm the woman from the magazine and your niece. We have to be informal. I get it, I'm not stupid. You're my aunt and we have to call each other with Miss and Madame. - Oh god, it's opposite. - Of course, I mixed it up. So, I am your niece. Nanny, it's best for you to shut up. Am I only here in the mood for comedy? - Listen Nanny, put down the bandanna. - Okay. - And the apron too. - Okay. Now you are like a lady. Aunt, please have a seat. God! It's him. One thing. At 7 I have a meeting with father, so if Stefan stays longer come and say I have to go to my workplace. - Okay. - Remember it. Good day, mister. Thank you so much. Please, come in. Mister engineer Zarnowski, Julek's colleague, this is our aunt. - Of course. - I'm glad to meet you. - I'm aunt. - How are you? - Have a seat. - Thank you, where's Julek? He had to go, but he apologizes for his absence. - I'm sure he'll be back soon. - And maybe not. Aunt, what's with coffee? It's cooking. Mister Dzinski... - I'll be back in a minute. - Good. Alone at last. Mister engineer, what kind of behaviour is this? - Human, completely normal. - Aunt! You see Miss, that was inhuman. Here you are. This coffee is pure gold. - For a good health. - Thank you very much. - Don't thank me. - Aunt, I will pour it myself. And you could put the flowers in the vase. Ah, yes. - Your aunt is a marvellous person. - Isn't she? The whole atmosphere here, I feel as I were in my own home. Miss Lucyna... it's true, we met only recently and maybe... you'll think I'm crazy if I say it directly... - If I say that... - What, mister Stefan? That I love you and I want to marry you. Sit down. - You're crazy. - Maybe I am but I'm in love. - It's the same thing. - Lucyna... - Please, sit calm. - Lucyna... - Aunt! - Okay, okay, okay. - Before I answer yes or no... - Just say yes, yes! Wait, wait. What do you know about me? I have to warn you that I'm very poor and hard-working girl. That's not important. I love you, I love you! I have to think about it. I'll tell you tomorrow. Only tomorrow? Yes. At the same time. - Will you come? - No. I will run, jump, fly. Lucyna, it's 7 o'clock. Time to go to work. Work? Yeah, I have to work in the evenings too. We have a deadline. We sew a wedding dress for the director. I'm so sorry for you. To suffer for some rich idiot. What to do? You have to go or I'll be late because of you. Okay. I'm leaving. - But before... - Before will be later, no! - Aunt! Aunt! - Lucyna! Aunt, Stefan wanted to say goodbye to you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye Miss Lucyna. - What happened here? - I think he didn't like the coffee. What is this important thing you have to say to me. - I don't know where to start. - Then don't but go right to the core. Okay. There is some engineer Zarnowski at your factory. Yes. - He's very nice and capable fellow. - Really? You like him? I see you like him. Yes. Very much. You see, I now... I can see you are in a doubt as well. Tell me everything, from the beginning. Shame Stefan, she made a fool out of you. And she looked like an ideal girl. Nice, likeable, pretty but impolite. Now she must be laughing out of you. Ha ha ha. And what do you think? - About what? - Are you laughing as well? You're pretending. You're very angry. Yes. I'm very angry. Dear God! I'm so happy. I can't be late, it's already 5:00 PM. Today he will know who I am. - Finally, I won't have to act anymore. - And you still acted. Poor and modest girl, who has gems, and whose evening activities are meeting old and wealthy men. Old and wealthy... Don't worry. Accidents happen. Maybe he'll come again. Doviđenja, dadiljo. It seems to me... ...that he gave up. - Hello. - Hello. Stop whistling. It breaks my nerves. What a pleasant guy. They had right when they warned my sister about you. First you seduced her then you run away. I don't want to hear about your sister. But why? It's not important. - Say it straight. - Not worthy. - Tell me now. - What do you want to know? - Yes? - I'll tell you! So, your sister is a poor hard-working girl, right? So where does she get diamond rings? Where does she have bracelets from? Because she's messing around with older men. Here. What a little brat. Wait, wait. God, what's that important? - Where's Miss Lucyna? - She's not here. Where is she? Where could she be? Of course, at prezident Bartknowski! What? Is she already going there publicly? - Publicly or not, she's really there. - There then I'll catch her! If it was the devil himself, not just boss, I would show them. 5,6,7, dark-haired. He's near. 8, 9, a boy. That's him. Ace of hearts, his heart. 10 of clubs, he thinks of me. I knew it. Ace, 9, 7 of spade. He'll come today, today. - He's here! - Please... You came at last. Can I speak to Miss Kwiatkowski? You mixed up surnames. My name is... Yeah, but I would like to talk with Miss... I am not a Miss anymore unfortunately, but... - you didn't think of me? - Not at all. - And where's Prezident? - In his cabinet. But I think that before... Sooner or later, it's all the same. I have to talk to him. Do you get it? I have to, I have to tell him. God, he really is in a hurry. Poor fellow, he went crazy from love for me. Hurry, hurry... My hawk, I'll wait for you downstairs. I told you everything, give me advice then. What should I do? Tell me, what should I do? Mister Stefan? Yes, it's me. I see I have interrupted a blessed idyll! Ha! I don't have any illusions anymore. You know each other for a long time. Yes we do. And you love this Mr. Prezident. More than my life. And you? You love Mr. Lucyna, don't you? - I adore. - You adore? Then marry her! Are you crazy? - I have to marry her? - Yes. I had good intentions towards her. - And you, I can see... - Please, young man, think for a moment. Don't interrupt me. You think I would work in your factory and not tell what do I think of you? You are... I don't care about your factory. But good sir, that is my daughter. Daughter? And Miss Kwiatkowska and Julek Kwiatkowski at the same time! Why are you so nervous, Amadeus Maria? Because Miss Lucyna talks to Mr. Prezident about our marriage. Oh no. Someone else is now talking to Prezident. And is proposing my hand. Mister Prezident, do you agree on marriage of your daughter? Yes. Do you agree that this charming fellow becomes part of our family? - Yes. - Thank you God! You made a fool out of me. Goodbye. - Mister Stefan? - Yes? - I want to say something to you. - Okay but quick. But you said If you find such a woman that you will fall in love with her Okay, okay. You'll be forever faithful to her You won't make her sad nor cry Oh yes, oh yes I'll be faithful to her like a dog I'll hold her in my hands I'll leave everything for her I will steal sun's shine for her, Of course, if I find such a woman, whom I will love, it will be like in heaven.
