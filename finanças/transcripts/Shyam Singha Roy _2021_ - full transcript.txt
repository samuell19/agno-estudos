This film is dedicated to you. While death awaits to engulf us, the rays of moonlight that touched you questioned me, "Where is the sun?" I told them that you reside in the memory of this ever-flowing river. SHYAM SINGHA ROY -Bro? -Bro, the cafe owner is pestering me to wrap up the shoot. Please talk to him. I can't take this torture anymore. Don't worry. He just likes to bluster. Just chill. I'll take care of it. -How many girls are coming today? -There are five girls here today. Okay. Get everything ready. I'll be right there. AAKALI RAJYAM IRUVAR -Good morning. -Morning, bro. -Everyone is here? All set? -Yes, we are ready. -Do they have the script? -Yes. -Have you explained the scene? -Yes, I've explained. Everyone had coffee as well. Thank you for reminding. Get me some black coffee. What are you looking at? Go and get me some coffee. -Get into position. -Yeah, bro. Hey, what the hell are you doing here? Don't you have any work to do? I've been promised a role in the film. Oh, is it? So that's why you have groomed yourself like a hero? You fool! They will put you far away in the background somewhere. You'll regret if you take a filmmaker's words for granted. Go and get some black coffee. Leave this here. If you take two months to complete the auditions for a short film, how long would you take to complete a feature film? Whatever we do, it must be perfect. -You're right. -Pan it to the right. This is not perfection. This is called obsession. By the time you become a director, you'll surely make me close down my cafe. Then, I'll have to open a small tea shop near a film studio. -That is your plan, right? -Bro. More than a 100 people have come to your cafe for auditions. We are promoting your brand for free. What is the name of my cafe? Coffin! Coffin? What the heck? It's Coffee Inn! -Coffee. Inn. -Okay. -Coffin is a box for burying a corpse. -Okay. -Okay. Ready. Ask them to come. -Yes, bro. Hello. -Did you read the script? -Yes. -Any doubts? -No. Ready. Start camera. Rolling, bro. Action! I am a woman. A lady with progressive views in this developing country. A person draped in a saree of revolution to drive away the darkness of fear. The dialogue is correct. Now, will you please act it out? I did act it out. It's very bland. There's no feeling in it. Don't mug up the dialogues. Keep them in your subconscious mind. Action! I am a woman. A lady with progressive views in this developing country. A beautiful person draped in a saree of revolution to drive away the darkness of fear. Have you worked as a news anchor? Yes. How do you know? We have seen you on TV. I am a beautiful girl. A girl from a developing country... That is not the dialogue! Read it once again, and deliver it correctly. Okay? Actually, I have worked in many short films. Also, I was a TikTok star prior to its ban. I have never auditioned before. I can directly come to the shoot. Is this necessary? You are more focused on your make-up than your performance. You may leave now. I am a woman. A lady with progressive views in this developing country. A beautiful person draped in a saree of revolution to drive away the darkness of fear. Good. I like it. Give me some time. My team will contact you soon. Hey, that girl is good. Why don't you cast her? She is good, but she isn't the perfect fit for the character. -She is too cliche. -This is too much. She's fair-skinned and tall. Her dialogue delivery is good. What else do you want? To become an actor or actress, it's not necessary that one must be fair or tall. Then? Body movements. Fine speech. Purity. Fine expression. What do you mean by expression? Body language. Yeah, yesterday's party was crazy, but I left early. Oh yeah! You know what happened? Yesterday, when we were going back home... That's the body language. Hey. So, exactly after she said that, we laughed about it. Yeah. Good body movements. The music was great, right? No, no. She is a drama queen. Yeah. Later, she started crying in the cab. You should have seen the face of the cab driver. Oh, my God! He was literally pleading with her. He was so frightened. Fine speech. -Hey, bro! -Hey! -Sorry, ma'am. -Please be careful. -Relax. Chill. -Sorry, ma'am. Don't panic. Here you go. -Okay? -Sorry, ma'am. That's okay. Purity. Oh! Okay. I got to go. I'll catch up with you guys later. -Okay, bye. -Bye. She's my female lead. Excuse me. Hi! Can I have a word with you? I'm Vasu, a film director. -Director? -Yeah. What movies have you directed? Tell her. Upcoming director. I'm directing a short film now. If it's successful, I'll be offered a movie. Okay. Nice, I guess. Good luck. I think it will be great if you could act in my film. Oh! Thanks. But me? Acting in a film? No way. I'm not interested. Sorry. You'll become interested once you start working. I've been holding the auditions for two months. You are exactly as I imagined that character. No... You don't understand. I'm not at all interested, so let's leave it here. Okay? I need to go. Bye. She is not interested. -Talk to her. -Hello! It's really hard to find a Telugu-speaking heroine. Please accept the role. You can get free coffee here. This is my cafe. Bro, relax. First of all, I don't like movies. I don't even watch them. Exactly. My heroine is also not interested in movies. Her physical appearance is similar to yours. Big eyes, arrogant attitude, and average looks. What the hell! -I mean... -I'm not interested, and I'm not doing it. -Say something, man. -That's it! Listen... Come on, man! I need to take care of my cafe. Then I'll continue the auditions at your place. Let's go and persuade her. Hey, what the hell! What do you think of yourselves? Don't you get it? You followed me to my house. Are you crazy? This is too much, man. How dare you? Hey... Relax. This is not right. I understand. We've come here because we're serious about casting you. We are working hard. Please don't refuse. What is this ruckus? Who are they? Dad, they have followed me all the way from a cafe. He is trying to persuade me despite my rejection. I'll call the she-team. Hey... You look like a decent guy. What do you do? Film director. Film director? What movies have you made? It's okay. Upcoming director. Oh! But I don't want to marry my daughter off to a movie man. Sorry, you can find someone else. I know, people don't even want to rent out their houses to movie people. -Your daughter... -Name is Keerti. I'm asking Keerti to act in my short film. Short film? Will you release it on YouTube? -I just want to show it to a producer... -It'll be on YouTube. -Your daughter can be part of it. -Is it? What other films has he made? -To file a harassment complaint... -What the hell. Ms. Keerti, listen to me. Your dad has approved. Now you must agree to it. Why should I? This is my last option. I don't have any other choice. If you don't agree, I'll tell your dad that you smoke. What the hell? My dad won't believe you. Are you for real? Please, Keerti. I'll delete it. Please understand my desperation. I'm really sorry for troubling you. This is really important for me. This short film is very crucial to my career. And I can't afford to hire professional actors. Films have been my passion since childhood. My budget is low. I've resigned my software job as well. Please understand. But I don't know how to act. Acting is nothing but reacting. Your reactions are naturally good. You are a natural star. It's just a short film, dear. Everyone is making them these days. Our neighbor uploads all her recipes on YouTube. I secretly follow her channel. Is he stalking that lady? I get to see you on screen when you're away. Please accept. Okay, I'll do it. But I'll leave Hyderabad in two weeks. -I'm going to Mumbai for higher studies. -All the best. She is pursuing her master's in psychology. Is that why she behaves like a psycho? So I can give you only two weeks. I've even booked my flight tickets. Two weeks is more than enough. And one more thing. If anything troubles me during the shoot, -I'll immediately opt out of it. -No... Don't worry. We'll take great care of you. You'll not be troubled in the slightest. And... What about that photo? Deleted. Deleted. I'll pick you up at 6 am. What photo is that? Photo... Selfie! Uncle, let's take a selfie. Please. Hello. Good morning, Heroine. Are you ready? I'm waiting at your gate. What? -Good morning. -Good morning. Oh, my God! Do you have a make-up artist? Where is the make-up artist? What make-up artist? That guy... Oh! He died of CoVID 19. Please do your own make-up. Make-up is set. The story is... She loves to paint from childhood. Canvas is her world. But her painting lacks soul. She searches for a color in every emotion. All of a sudden, she finds a blank paper one day. On the screen A picture moves Begins a story A star has descended from the sky Walking on the earth This take is okay. An angry young damsel Portrays a myriad of characters The sight of which mesmerizes you And everything goes up in smoke in a flash Isn't it enchanting? It's beyond what the human eye can capture See the world through this lens It'll show everything with greater clarity Its light reveals what's concealed in the shadows Although the work proves difficult, Strangely, one would begin to love it Continue... Okay. Nice. You are doing great. Shall we go for the next scene? Change your costume. Ready. Hey, where shall I change my dress? Well, you can use my car. I'll cover the car with a black cloth. What the hell? I don't even use the fitting rooms at a clothes store. And you are asking me to change my dress on a highway? Impossible! Keerti, films have been my passion since childhood. My budget is low. I've even resigned my job. Please understand. What are you looking at? Bro, it's about to rain. Good. We can use the rain effect for free. It costs a lot to artificially create one. Will the actress agree to it? Okay. Rolling! Action! Oh, shit. Keerti... Keep walking... Be in the mood! Slowly look at the sky and cry your heart out. More. More. Cut! Nice. One more! The house looks great. -Keep it in top angle. A nice shot. -Okay. Tell them to turn those lights off. It's the police. Are you shooting a film? Do you have a permit? -It's just a short film, sir. -It doesn't matter. We have received a complaint from the MP. What's his problem with us? He saw a drone flying around his house. Come to the station. You can take us, but leave the girl alone. Oh! She is with you! I thought she was related to the MP. -Bhadram. -Sir. -Get her into the car. -Okay, sir. And then what? Don't take my cap. Sorry, sir. I'll make sure this never happens again. Keerti! Keerti... Why should I put up with a crazy movie guy? I am a graduate in psychology. Why should I get myself detained at police stations because of you? -Just go to hell. -Okay. Okay. I've skipped this month's rent to pay for the shoot. I don't have enough budget to hire a new actress. It will stall the shooting of my film. So be it! So be it. It's all right. Films have been my passion since childhood. My budget is low. I've resigned my job as well. -Please, understand. This short film-- -I understand. Your career requires me to suffer. Stop your theatrics. I'll do it. Thank you, Keerti! Thank you, uncle. Thank god she's agreed to work with me again. Thank you. Come, let's go. Such an idiot. A dream never dies Yet turning it into a reality is no small matter Face the hardships Take your time But never give up Your dream will surely be realized one day There are only two colors Sunlight converts them into seven Paint your dream colorfully Let it reach the silver screen The destination may be far away But I'm going to reach it anyway See the world through this lens It'll show everything with greater clarity Its light reveals what's concealed in the shadows Although the work proves difficult, Strangely, one would begin to love it -Tomorrow is the last day of the shoot. -Yeah, bye. Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Hi, ma'am. -Hello, ma'am. We've been waiting to take a selfie with you. Why? Aren't you the heroine of this film? Yes, I am. Keshav, go back two steps. -Don't be shy. Come closer. -All right. Hey, stop it! -Bro... -One second. Wait for two counts, then immediately take camera favor. What are you doing? Don't you have manners? -Do you think I'm-- -Do you want us to buy a ticket for this? Bro. How dare you touch me? Hold this. Come, let's take a selfie. No... Vasu... Vasu! What's happening? Who are these guys? -Sachin, what happened here? -Bro... You ear is bleeding. Are you okay? Hey, what's wrong? The tripod! It cost us Rs. 15,000. How did it break? You acted like a hero and broke it. First, let's get out of here. VARNAM -Congrats, Vasu. -Sir. Well done! Nice! You dealt with the subject maturely. Thank you, sir. -We shall work together. -Yes, sir. Get him to sign the agreement and pay him an advance. Meet me when you have the bound script ready. I'll get it done within a month. -Good luck. -Thank you, sir. -Sir. -Vasu, I'll leave for the US tomorrow. When will I get the script? I may not come back for two months. It's almost done, sir. I'll give it to you tomorrow morning. Come to my office at 10 am. I'm catching the afternoon flight. Okay, sir. TALK TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE Amazing. It's a great script, Vasu. The climax is just mind-blowing. I can put money on this. Thank you, sir. You are a very good writer. You can start the project now. I'll assign you a team. Thank you, sir. Here you go. Let's wait a little longer. Wait for what? It'll lose the chillness. I'm waiting for Keerti. You carry on. Hi, Keerti. Wow! So excited to meet her? You... Hi, Keerti. Are you pulling my leg again? -Hi. -Hi. Nice view. What is in that bag? Did you bring some snacks? A small gift for you. For me? It's not really necessary. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm really happy for you. It's very nice. Your device is connected. Vasu, mention a special thanks to me in the credits of your feature film. I'll be your lucky charm. Not just my name, but also add my photo. Photo is added if the person is dead. Shall I do it? No need. You guys are unbelievable. I despised you guys in the beginning, but now I'll miss you all. Please be in touch. You will leave for Mumbai. This guy will ignore us once he starts working on his new film. I'll be all alone, selling coffee. Stop your theatrics. He will surely forget me. Do you think I'll forget you? Impossible. In that case, wear the shirt that I've just gifted you when you succeed as a director. Then I will believe that you still remember me. Done. Okay. I'll leave. Hey, kid. Come, let's go. -Bye. -See you. Bye. Nice. How long will you stay here? I'll leave in another five minutes. Cool. Keerti, tell your friends to keep visiting my cafe. -I'll give them a ten percent discount. -Okay. -See you. -Don't roam around, go home. To your home! Okay. It's about to rain. Get inside. So? When will we meet again? I don't know. Sorry. I didn't get you a gift. Bye. Rosie. What the fuck! -What happened? -Who is Rosie? I thought you were a gentleman. Such a pervert! Keerti, what's wrong? How can you think about another girl when you are sharing a bed with me? You should be ashamed! This is the psychology of men. You can never truly love one girl. You men are dogs. Keerti... I'm really sorry. Rosie? I don't know any Rosie. It's just a slip of the tongue. Just shut up and get lost. It was stupid of me to fall in love with you. This is so embarrassing. I never want to see your face again. Rosie? Who is Rosie? I don't know. Tell me the truth. It's the truth. I've never heard that name... -Rosie. -I've never heard it before. -Then why did you say call her Rosie? -I don't know. You must have picked that name from some shitty Hollywood film. And you called her by that name. She won't take it easy. Shit! What do I do now? After years of struggle, you've got an opportunity to make a feature film. Concentrate on that. Finish the script and start the work. You can meet plenty of women in your life. Rolling! Action! Silence! UNIKI Are you nervous? That's a small word to describe my feelings now. I don't even know how to describe it. It's a ten-year dream, and one whole year of hard work. Bro, the show has just ended. Bro, how do you like the movie? It's great. I loved it. A blockbuster! The movie is a hit! Congratulations, dude! Congratulations. Bro, he is the director of this film. You are the director of the film! The movie is amazing. A blockbuster. The climax was mind-blowing! Bro, can I take a selfie with you? Please, let me take a selfie. Okay, keep moving. Slowly. Please keep moving. Why are you crying like a baby? Your film is a hit. Vasu, I just got a call from Mumbai. Producer Vishal Chaturvedi has seen our movie. He wants to remake it in Hindi. Wow! And they want you to direct the Hindi version as well. -Are you serious? A Bollywood film? -Bro, this is crazy! You are one lucky guy. You will be reaching greater heights. Let's celebrate. Open the bottle! MUMBAI MUMBAI KOLKATA Welcome to all of you. Well, I'm super excited and happy to introduce a south Indian sensation, Mr. Vasudev, to the Hindi cinema. I must say that his last film was a super-duper blockbuster hit. Uniki. UNIKI Well, we are about to make it now in Hindi. Background? He has no godfather in the industry. He is a nobody. I've got some more great news to share with all of you. We're gonna be making two more very high budget films with him. Mr. Vasudev? We have an arrest warrant against you. You have to come with us. Arrest warrant? What? Come on. Let's go. Well, this is a shocking news for us. Our company doesn't entertain this kind of stuff. I'm calling this announcement off. In the old days, our directors gave their blood and sweat to earn success. He has tarnished our reputation in Mumbai. What's his name? -Vasu. -Yes, that's him. After I saw the film, it hit me that I've read this story somewhere. HE COPIED FROM BENGALI, AND NOT KOREAN OR HOLLYWOOD! What do you say about Vasu's arrest? I'm not responsible for a director's plagiarism. I can't keep track of all the stories. It is his fault. Our agreement with Vasu clearly states that he's responsible for all the legal actions. The brain can generate four kinds of waves. Delta, theta, alpha, and beta. And each of these states... Yes, Dad. Keerti, do you remember that short-film director? He has been arrested. Did you see the news? -You mean Vasu? -Yes, it's Vasu. Why? He was arrested on charges of copyright infringement. I'm sending you the news link. Okay. I'll call you back. DIRECTOR VASU ARRESTED DURING PRESS MEET Bro, please tell me if you know any good lawyers. It's about the director who got arrested. Yes, he is my friend. No, he is a good guy. He is framed by someone. Okay. Please let me know if you find any good lawyers. Okay. Bye. She is Padmavati, my cousin. Oh. Nobody in my family likes her. We always fought each other. Then why did you bring me to her? She was a gold-medalist in college. -Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. I need help with the drunk driving charges against me. The breath analyzer showed 300 points. Who drinks that much? Even if the judge lets you go, I won't. Hi, Paddu. How are you? I'm a bit irritated. How are your parents? I don't know. I haven't met them in a long time. I have been meaning to meet you for a long time. But I couldn't. I know that none of my relatives want to meet me unless they need some legal help. What can I do for you? As I told you, it's about my friend, Vasu, the film director. Oh! Yes. I saw it on the news. He was arrested during a press meet. He is your friend! So sad. Yes, ma'am. You must help him out. What do you do? I own a cafe. Do you provide a free service to all your customers or do you charge them? We charge them. I understand. Of course. Tell me how much you charge. I will pay you. I will. But first, I need to meet the accused. He is in the police station. Let's go, please. You are right. You shouldn't meet her often. Hi, Vasu. I am Padmavati, your lawyer. What's happening? Why did they arrest me? India's largest publication house, SR Publishers, has lodged a case of copyright infringement against you. They have alleged that your scripts and the story of your film have been plagiarized from their Telugu and Bengali books. What? Nonsense. I've studied your case. I'll come to the point. If you plead guilty to your crime without wasting the court's time, your punishment could be reduced. Since this is not a grave crime like murder or rape, you can get away with a mere six-month sentence or with just a fine, if you are lucky. I should plead guilty? Who told you that I'm guilty? I'm not apologizing to anyone. I did not plagiarize from any book. I wrote those stories. Two years ago, I registered them with the Telugu Writers Association. I have proof. These books were published 50 years ago. Your stories match theirs exactly. You didn't even have the sense to change the names of the characters while copying from them. They are exactly the same. Even a kid can tell that you have copied from this book. Look, I'd lose my cool if you keep saying that I copied someone's work. I've never read these books. And I don't know Bengali either. One should never lie to a doctor or lawyer. I'm here to help you. Are you my lawyer or the opponent's? Why are you forcing me to plead guilty? I didn't plagiarize. Why don't you get it? Hey! Keep your voice down. It's not about me. We have to prove to the court that you didn't plagiarize. As a lawyer, it's your responsibility to prove it. There's nothing to prove. The evidence is against you. Quit if you can't do it. I'll get another lawyer. Okay. Good luck. Okay. Fuck off! What the... I can't deal with him. Hire another lawyer. -He's too adamant. -What happened? It's a simple open and shut case. I can't help him if he doesn't cooperate. He's really important to me. Please don't give up on him. Really? What is he to you? Your boyfriend? It's a long story. Okay. None of my business. Well, I can get a bail order for him. But I can't take up this case. His opponent's lawyer is Mr. Krishnamurthy. To go up against him is nothing less than hitting a dead wall. Impossible. You know, I have his photo in my office. Why? He is my inspiration. I aspire to become a lawyer like him. If you want to become as great as him, you have to beat a lawyer of his stature. Now you have that opportunity. Please think about it. "Copyright case OS no. 234 of 2021," "complainant SR Publishers accused on Vasudev Ghanta." Yes, proceed. Your Honor, my client, SR Publishers, is a leading publishing house in the country. They have contributed a lot to the growth of literature in our country, Your Honor. Now, coming to the point, the issue here is, this man here, named Vasudev plagiarized from Astitva, which is my client's intellectual property and a best-selling novel. The accused converted it into a script, and made a movie out of it. That is not all, Your Honor. He has plagiarized two more books, converted them into scripts, and sold them to a Bollywood production house. Mr. Vasudev did that. These stories were authored by a legendary Bengali-Telugu writer, who shook the entire nation and the government alike with his writings in the 1970s. His name is Shyam Singha Roy. I'm submitting to the court the copies of the original novel and the plagiarized script by Mr. Vasudev. Please. WHERE THERE IS DHARMA, THERE WILL BE VICTORY UNIKI ASTITVA Your Honor, it's a color-able imitation of the original with the sole purpose of deriving profits. It's a direct infringement of three novels which are copyright properties of my client, SR Publishers. So now, on behalf of my client, under section 63 of the copyright act 1957, I hereby demand that Mr. Vasu be sentenced to five years of imprisonment and a penalty of Rs. 10 crores be levied upon him. Also, a 50 percent share in the revenue generated by the plagiarized film should be granted to my client. That'll be all for now, Your Honor. Thank you so much. Defense. You may put forward your case. -Plead guilty. -Impossible. Your Honor, this is a false accusation. My client doesn't accept this accusation. We plead not guilty. My client is innocent until proven guilty. The court has verified the copies of both the works. 98 percent of the content is exactly the same. How could he have written it without plagiarizing? I don't believe it's a coincidence. The prima facie evidence is sufficient for the court to believe that he's guilty. Then how do you defend and prove your innocence? I don't know why both the works are the same. But I can tell you this, I didn't copy my stories from any book. My stories are my creation. You can conduct a lie detection test if you want. What? This is not a movie. Lie detection tests are not approved just like that. -What do you... -Your Honor... Let's do that. It will save everyone's time. Let's go ahead with the lie detection test. Defense? That is the request from the defense, sir. Okay. According to the section 45, selection of evidence, the court authorizes the forensic department to conduct a lie detection test on Mr. Vasudev. The forensic department has concluded that Mr. Vasudev is not lying. Your Honor, the lie detection test can only be considered as corroborative evidence but not as complete evidence. I'm sure the defense is well aware about this. It is not impossible to cheat the lie detection test. The accused is yet to prove himself innocent. Until then, the charges against Mr. Vasudev will remain valid. That's all, Your Honor. Your Honor, we need more time to prove my client's innocence. To look deep into the issue and gather more evidence. I also request for an unconditional bail for my client. Your Honor, I object to the unconditional bail. Overruled. The court grants unconditional bail to Mr. Vasudev and also grants a period of three days to the defense to submit further evidence. Until then, the court is adjourned. I believe that he has plagiarized. Nowadays, young filmmakers are increasingly plagiarizing other works and calling that as inspiration. Such people must not be granted bail. How are you? I'm fine. This shirt looks good on you. I got arrested after wearing it. But... Thank you. I am the one who got you bail. You should be thanking me. First, you need to trust me. Then, I'll thank you. How can I trust you? Your work exactly matches the content of those books. I don't get it either. How can they be so similar? Give me those books. Shyam Singha Roy. I think the 'SR' in SR Publishers stands for Singha Roy. I have studied this family. Shyam's mother was a Telugu, and father a Bengali. Theirs was a love marriage. They settled in West Bengal. Shyam had three siblings and he was the youngest. He was born in a village called Kalikapur in the Kharagpur district of West Bengal. He became a famous writer and a renowned social activist in Kolkata. Post the year 1977, there is no information available on his whereabouts. If he is assumed dead, no one knows where his grave is. In 1985, his three brothers met with a tragic car accident. The children of those dead brothers are currently running the company. They filed the case against you. There are no photos of Shyam except for the paintings in these books. Since his mother was a Telugu, Shyam was well-versed in Telugu as well. He wrote books in Telugu too. TRAITOR NAXALBARI TO MY BELOVED GOPAL Keri, a 10-year-old girl, was donated by her father to a temple. "Her father donated her" "to a temple." Vasu. Your ear is bleeding again. Why is he bleeding? Sometimes he gets zoned out. And he forgets his surroundings. Whenever that happens, he bleeds from his ear. How many times has it happened before? Many times. It happened on the day when we fought. Once while writing this script. While shooting the short film. And a few more times. We even consulted a doctor. He did some tests and said that it was the result of stress. He was working on his first film. He never slept properly the whole time. Strange. Yes, ma'am. I really think something is wrong with him. What do you think? A human mind is as mysterious as the whole universe. Nobody knows the infinite secrets that are hidden within. Human consciousness is an ocean full of secrets. How do you propose we unearth the secrets of Vasu's mind? We can try clinical hypnosis on him. Hypnosis? Yeah. With hypnotherapy, there is a chance to know what happens inside Vasu's brain during those blackouts. Okay, ma'am. One final request. This is a sensitive case. So I urge you to deal with this matter personally. Sure. Our print sales are declined by 23... Excuse us. He is out on bail. Also, he passed the lie detection test. Uncle! Is it Shyam's story? Yes, Uncle. Sit. Hi, Vasu. From our conversation, I have noted down the dates when you experienced those blackouts. Vasu, I'm going to start the procedure now. Just relax. Take a deep breath in. Inhale and exhale all your worries out. Follow my voice and look at the monitor. This book is your life. Do you know today's date? August 17th. Do you remember the day when you were arrested? Last Thursday. When was your film released? July 7th. Vasu. Vasu. Let's go a little back. Do you remember the date when you finished your script? October 19th. Vasu, what happened on that day? I had to submit my script the next day. However hard I tried, I wasn't able to write the climax. I felt a severe headache. I felt dizzy. My whole body felt very heavy. And? Come on, Vasu. Try harder. Try to remember. What happened after that? What did you do? Try hard, Vasu. You can do it. Rosie. Rosie? Who is Rosie? How is she related to you? My wife. Vasu? She's my wife. Did Rosie give you these Bengali books? These books were not published then. ASTITVA - NAXALBARI What do you mean? What year are we talking about? 1969. What is your name? Shyam Singha Roy. 1969, KALIKAPUR, WEST BENGAL, MONTH OF ASHWAYUJA, RIVER GANGES Please give me some water. Sister, give me some water. Please give me some water. What's the matter? Why don't you go and fetch yourself some water instead of asking everyone? We aren't supposed to touch the well, sir. Did the well forbid you? You can either wait for the rains, or you can pluck up some courage. Hey, Shyam! He is a pariah. He cannot touch the water from the well. -What does that mean? -He is beneath us. The water comes from the ground which is beneath our feet. He is low caste. Shouldn't he get thirsty then? Water is not owned by any particular caste. He was born and raised in this village. He belongs to this very land. The same land grows the food which your children eat. He is an untouchable. Then why are you walking on the land that he walks on? Why are you breathing the same air that he breathes? Stop breathing! Land, air, and water are life-preserving resources. They don't abide by the evil caste system. You can't impose caste hierarchy anymore. This isn't the age of Rigveda. We now live in independent India. An Ambedkar has arrived here! You can write these ideas in your books. Maybe we read them sometime. If you dare touch the water, we will burn down your hut, and then, we'll skin you alive. Sir, we don't want water. We will go away. We will go away. Now, this well is untouchable as well. This belongs to him. Those who are thirsty can still draw water from here. Those who want to abide by caste can die of thirst. Before you go near his hut, do keep in mind that I know where your house is. Beware! Very good. Well done, comrade. Friend, come and join us. One bullet can kill only one person. Whereas one written word can mobilize millions of people. "The sky is covered with clouds and the sun has gone down." "Kuku went to fetch water from the Padma Dighi sector." It's Padma riverbank. Padma... Riverbank. Your father taught me this song when I was your age. I'd sit on his lap and learn. Now it's my responsibility to pass it on to you guys. What have you done this time, Shyam? Your brother is very angry with you. What did I do? Have I done something? Dadabhai is coming back from Kharagpur. Be careful with him. No matter what he says to you, don't talk back to him. Have some of this sacred food. Do not fight during the festivities. What's the matter? Is it about today's incident? Or yesterday's incident? Or about the one from the day before? Sit here. Do you realize what you are doing? You bring dishonor to our family. You threw a Dalit into the well. Are you out of your mind? They will banish us from this village. Don't worry about that, brother. I'll leave this place. This is a place where some humans are treated as filth by fellow humans. I can't stay here. Go away. Join those low-caste people and dream of bringing a revolution. I've heard that you're mixing with those armed revolutionaries. If I wanted to join them, I could find my way to their base in the forest. My principles are different. Your principles and books are good for nothing. Selfishness is the hallmark of human life. I agree. Selfishness is a great virtue. You care for your family. That's selfishness. I care about the world around me. That's my selfishness. Shyam? Don't be upset that he hit you. He's our elder brother. I am not upset with our brother. I am upset about the society. It's not just one village, this problem plagues the whole country. Only literature can bring about a change in society. Shyam. I have to go. And I must write. Have you packed already? Don't tell anyone. I bought the ticket for the Howrah Express three days ago. Festivities are going on. Can't you wait until it is over? The festival will come again next year. Lost time will never come back. Anyway, I'm an atheist. I'll leave at midnight when everyone is asleep. Please ask sister-in-law to pack me some rasgullas. Shyam. Quit smoking. It's empty now. I've quit it. Be careful. Write us a letter as soon as you reach. Hey! Do you know where the boatman is? It's the first day of Navaratri festivities. He must be in the temple along with the others. The protector of life The ruler of the universe Goddess Sridevi seated on a lotus Shower us with your compassion With magical steps The soul dances to the tunes In sync with the multitude of names Pour your blessings over me My thoughts Should forever pay tributes to you The anguish within me Needs to be soothed with your gentle affection I placed you in the temple of my body My life is dedicated to your service I saw you in every sacrifice and every suffering I've chanted only your name all my life With magical steps The soul dances to the tunes In sync with the multitude of names Pour your blessings over me I seek your refuge, O Goddess of art The ruler of the world Aren't you the protector Of those who are vulnerable? Please respond to my prayers Bro, are you looking for me? It's getting late. Let's go. Girls, move quickly. There is a crowd behind us. Move quickly. You danced very well. -Move... -Please bless my child. Move it. Girls, don't be late. Come on. Bro, let's go. Why are they taking them inside? They are devadasis who migrated from Bangladesh. The wives of the deity. No man is supposed to lay his eyes on them. They are held captive in there. They come to the temple to dance, and then again go back. They offer many services inside. They entertain and satisfy the deity with their dance and whatnot. Hey, wait! Look, girls. All of you get up. Stand in a line. Mahant is here. That girl. Look here. Get her ready soon. If it's delayed, I will see to your end. Faster. Move. There are people following us. Come on, move fast. What happened? Move your feet. Quickly. What are you looking at? Girls, get in quickly. You dance beautifully. I need to talk to you. Will you come out with me? What's your name? Hey, Maitreyi! Come, move it. Come on, make it fast. What are you looking at? Maitreyi. Come. What's the matter? Why aren't you asleep yet? What are you thinking? Shashi, do you know what happened out there? A guy asked me to go out with him. Go out? I mean, to go outside the temple. -Are you serious? -Hush! Yes. Are you going? Going where? You know we can't do that. How dare he ask me to go out with him! He must have considered us normal humans. Had I been in your place, I would've gone away with him right then. Of course, you would. If someone listens to our conversation, we will be punished and locked up. Go to sleep. Anyway, how can we go out with a stranger? Higher! Higher! Didn't you leave for Kolkata to write your books? What's the hurry? Let the nine-day festivities get over. Since when did you turn into a theist? It's not theism. It's love. THIRD NIGHT Thus Binodini, a devadasi, spent her entire life in the temple and attained the path to heaven. Didn't Binodini ever step out of the temple threshold? No. Why? It is our culture, a devadasi, wife of a deity, is not supposed to leave the shelter of God. Isn't this whole world a shelter of God? So, what's wrong if they come out? Poor Binodini! She could never experience the beauty of this world, which your God created. Instead of living a 100 years as a slave, living one day as a free human being is more meaningful. Everyone, come and take the sacred food. Come to the south entrance at 10 pm. I'll be waiting for you. I thought you must have left. I knew you would come. I don't want to go out. I came here to see if you were really waiting here. Okay. Come. Maitreyi! That's the name the temple gave you. What's the name your parents gave you? I'll have to ask them if I ever meet them. How do you know Telugu? The teachers from Andhra taught me Kuchipudi dance and Telugu. I learned Tamil along with Bharatanatyam. I learned Malayalam along with Mohiniyattam. Also, I know Odiya, Assamese, and Sanskrit too. Do you know how to row a boat? No. I'll teach you. Hold this. There are two ways to do any activity in this world. One, with fear. And the other... With love. Just like the way you dance. What do you do? I'm a writer. I write. What do you write? The things I need to tell this world. How will you tell this world about me? Milky cheeks... The skin that radiates a golden glow... The eyes that resemble a child in fear... Flowy hair... The figure, that of a finely chiseled sculpture... Dances like a peacock... A maiden who never tasted the love of her parents... Living in companionship with a rock... Though the body has been violated in the name of God, yet the heart is filled with holiness. It's almost dawn. I have to go. Please take me back. Time just flies by while talking with you. By the way, what's your name? Shyam. Shyam Singha Roy. FOURTH NIGHT Two star-crossed lovers Brought together by this resplendent moonlight Despite a great distance between us We meet on this riverbank Opening the curtains of midnight While this river was deep asleep You emerged like a dream That I never saw before The glimmer in her eyes, The shimmer on her cheeks The jingle in her ankle bells A dream never seen before Mesmerized by the beauty of this love This autumn night has become envious of us The purest form of art in her glittering eyes Casts a spell Her beauty is unrivaled Nothing can ever surpass it Perhaps she is the image of all this is beautiful in this creation As beautiful as the place where the sky meets the earth FIFTH NIGHT He is Manoj Singha Roy, my third elder brother. My eldest brother is like a father figure, whereas he is like a mother to me. This is my friend. Hello. Who are you related to? She is related to God. SIXTH NIGHT She is... Ripping away the screen, I'm looking at the beaming beauty Breaking away all boundaries Darkness meets light The starry night looks at her in amazement The jubilation of my soul knows no bounds The inception of this story was predestined on the eve of Navaratri The silence turns Into affectionate memories Turn into delightful poetry And shows glimpse of all the stories Yet to be written The glimmer in her eyes, The shimmer on her cheeks The jingle of her ankle bells A dream never seen before Mesmerized by the beauty of this love This autumn night has become envious of us The purest form of art In her glittering eyes Casts a spell Her beauty is unrivaled Nothing can ever surpass it Perhaps she is the image of all that is beautiful in this creation Shyam... You're like a rose that spreads beauty and bliss while surrounded by thorns. Today onwards your name is... Rosie! As beautiful as the place where the sky meets the earth Rosie! The glimmer in her eyes, The shimmer on her cheeks The jingle of her ankle bells A dream never seen before NINTH NIGHT Come away with me, Rosie. I come out with you every day. Not like this. Get out of this captivity and come into my life. Come to Kolkata with me. We shall get married and start a new life together. Shyam, don't forget that I am a devadasi. A woman is a slave to none. And the one who desires enslavement can never be God. This is human slavery under the guise of God. Forget it. Tell me, are you happy? Do you want to live like a slave? There are no other festivities in my life except these nine nights. Nobody wishes to lead such a life. We live it out thinking this is what destiny has in store for us. Nothing is superior to one's self-respect. There is nothing wrong in standing up for what is right. Only cowards talk about destiny. Why do you undermine your own value? Ridiculous! How can I say what my worth is? My life was bartered for a sack of rice, that is my worth. A sculpture in that temple is worthier than me. Your worth cannot be determined by any one, no matter who they are. It is what you believe, the belief that you have in yourself. Can I survive in the outside world? Will this society accept me if I leave the temple? Tell me. Have you heard about MS Subbalakshmi? She was a devadasi too. But today she is a Padma Bhushan awardee. Balasaraswathi, the greatest Bharatanatyam dancer in India belongs to a devadasi family. You have mastered the art of classical dance. I am with you, and always will be. You can have a life that you desire. You need not fear anyone. Tomorrow is Vijayadashami. I'll be waiting for you. Across this river, there is a world awaiting our arrival. VIJAYADASHAMI Careful, hold this. Over here. Oh, God. You are so badly injured. I'm so sorry for this. Here... Careful. What happened? What happened? Be careful. Girls, where are you? Come fast. Mahant is here. Come, stand in line. Come fast. That girl. Let go of me. I won't come. Leave me, I won't come. I won't go. I don't want to go. It's a full moon night. We won't come. We are wives of God. It means, we are like goddesses. We are not sculptures that anyone can lay hands on. We are human beings. Nobody owns us. Not even the God. How dare you speak against me! You are not a slave of God, but you're a slave of mine. Mahant's word is always final. Go from that side. Go from that side. Hey! Move fast. Who the hell are you? How dare you! Catch him. Don't let him get away. Every woman is as sacred as a temple sanctum. What should be done to the wild dog that contaminates a temple sanctum? A woman is not a slave to anyone. Not even to God. Beware! Get down. Come on, get down. DAINIK BANGLA ROYAL PRESS PROP. SAYAN SARKAR Yes? I need some work. I can give you a job without pay. But I will take care of food and accommodation. In that case, we are two people. Oh. Grandpa asked me to give this to you. They'll be here in an hour. I don't know how to cook. Can I have one more rasgulla? -Do you want to learn to dance? -Yes. You can never bear a child. I'm very sorry. Why do you need kids? Am I not enough? Type this and compose the rest of the text. I'll check it. Sir. I have written an article on the topic that you've been working on. Would you like to see it once? Show me. What nonsense have you written? You can't just write whatever comes to your mind. Print this one. You are a great writer. And I take full responsibility of printing your first book. Thank you. He is the personification of literature That which is born out of the paper To annihilate the injustice in this world The pen which has The sharpness of a sword He is Shyam Singha Roy He is a raging tempest His struggle is a retaliation against injustice ASTITVA Nothing can suppress his intelligence ASTITVA Hey, congratulations! The book became a huge success. His writing creates quite a stir He strives to seek the truth He fights for the welfare of people We're arresting you for writing against the government. Red salute to the revolutionaries! Every printed page carries his struggle forward Start printing. He wages a war of words with the cruelest of rulers Shyam Singha Roy He is a raging tempest Shyam Singha Roy To annihilate the injustice in this world Shyam Singha Roy Nothing can suppress his intelligence Shyam Singha Roy He is a raging tempest Royalty checks. Let's buy a piece of land and build our own house. What's the matter, Rosie? I was lucky to find you and I escaped from their captivity. If there were 25 devadasis in just one temple, in temples across the nation, just imagine how many devadasis must be living under subjugation. But society doesn't have any regard for them. Who will liberate them from their struggles? Who is responsible for their children's future? If the pen becomes a weapon, and if the ink says revolution When the hyenas attack, the society wins again Beware! They're always trying to put you down The name has lion in it, There is no way Shyam can lose The ones who want to snatch your food, they get scared TRAITOR He bleeds blue, His slogans raise processions His burning questions are loosening The lock on temple doors When Shyam walks on the road, He teaches how to cross all boundaries No one is a prisoner anymore, It's a checkmate of the queens In a community where a woman sells her flesh to feed herself, all men from that community are impotent. Women are not a commodity! He is a symbol of revolt Who care if you're good or bad Who knows no difference between races Absolute freedom is your dream None of your detractors or rivals can harm you No matter where a woman lives, She continues to face subjugation A woman is regarded as Goddess Kali, But they are shackled by patriarchy She owes her freedom to you Shyam Singha Roy He is a raging tempest Shyam Singha Roy His struggle is a retaliation against injustice Shyam Singha Roy Nothing can suppress his intelligence Shyam Singha Roy He is a raging tempest ASTITVA TO DOWN WITH SHYAM SINGHA ROY Shyam Singha Roy I AM A FAN OF YOUR IDEAS He is a force to be reckoned with Shyam Singha Roy Singha Roy... Many more are coming. We can't accommodate them all here. I'm planning to provide housing and jobs to those who can work, and a pension for those who can't work. Even the government will help me in this. I have no worries in my mind. It is as clear as this moonless sky. Is this what we call happiness? Shyam, you know what? It is said that a devadasi who dies on a new moon day will be unified with God. Whenever death comes knocking at my door-- I want to die on a new moon day like this, lying on your lap, staring at you in my last moments with a smile on my lips. That's my final wish. Our elder brother is unwell. He wants to see you. Will you come home once? I'm scared of that village. After all that has happened there, I don't feel good about you going back to that village. Don't go, Shyam. I lost my parents in my childhood. My brother has been a father figure to me since then. I have to go, Rosie. Fear shouldn't constrain my love for my family. Take care. Even if it takes a while... I promise, I'll be back. I read your books without the knowledge of our brothers. I've collected all your books. I'm your biggest fan. What are you writing? Is it a new story? A short story. I've just got the idea. Read it and tell me your opinion. Sister-in-law, Shyam is here! Everybody come here. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm good. Have some food. Serve him food. Hurry up. Go and get some coconuts from the market. I'll get some rasgullas as well, okay? Take care of him. Why is the house so silent? Where are the kids? They are in Kharagpur, pursuing their studies there. How are you, Sister-in-law? What happened? Are you all right? Nothing like that. Have your food, Shyam. Sit. You may go inside. How is your health, Brother? Fine. Everybody is talking about you. I read about you in the newspapers as well. You have become a great person. I haven't read any of your books. I don't like your thoughts anyway. But you have done well in your life, that's good enough for me. We can't do away with blood relationships. I can't keep you away. I've arranged a match for you, from our caste. Meet her once, and then get married. You can continue your social service from here. I'm already married, Brother. If this is what you wanted to discuss, then I'm done with it. We will never accept that prostitute as a daughter-in-law in this house. She's my wife. Rosie Singha Roy. If you speak ill of her once again, I'd make you pay for it. Beware! You revolted against our traditions and left this village. And because you belong to this family and we are your siblings, the people here are treating us like untouchables. Only your death can guarantee a good future for our children. We can regain our honor in this village by putting you to death. Shyam! Shyam! Shyam! What did you do to him? Shyam! I promised her that I would come back. Oh, God! Shyam! Shyam! I have made a mistake, Shyam! Shyam! I need to go to Kolkata. Who are you? What do you want? The press owner, Sayan Sarkar. He is my grandfather. Sarada? A dance teacher named Rosie used to live here. Rosie? Our Rosie? Nobody came looking for Rosie in all these years. Are you a relative of hers? I'm a very close relative of hers. There was nobody to look after the trust. Hence it was shut down. Many of them were left in a helpless situation. Some of them chose to switch back to their previous livelihood, for the sake of their children. A few families have managed to survive in Sonagachi. I was very small then. I don't clearly remember, but a few days after her husband Shyam's disappearance, Rosie too left this place, and went away searching for Shyam. After that, Emergency was declared in the nation. Vasu, we need to be in the court tomorrow. Your Honor... I'm really sorry, Your Honor. But in my career of close to about 35 years, I've never seen something as preposterous or as absurd as this. Rebirth! Finding no other way to disprove their crime, they are presenting such a third-rate concept in court. The accused is a filmmaker, Your Honor. He shot a video and he is playing that as evidence. Your Honor, this isn't the 16th century. We are in the 21st century. If we accept such videos as evidence, tomorrow someone else, claiming to be the reincarnation of Dhirubhai Ambani, might lay claim to the ownership of Reliance Industries. But just to humbly remind the honorable court, Your Honor, hypnotherapy is not medically approved in India. -Isn't it so, professor? -Yes, but-- That's it. So, Your Honor, I will conclude with two things. Hypnosis results cannot be considered as evidence in any case. And, the idea of reincarnation is a superstition. There is no scientific proof for that. That'll be all, Your Honor. With that, I rest my case. Thank you. You may leave now, ma'am. Mr. Krishnamurthy... What is that on your forehead? That's a religious mark. So? As you are a devotee of Lord Vishnu, I don't need to remind you this. When people demanded to build a temple in Ayodhya for Lord Rama, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the Supreme Court of India permitted them to do so, but never asked for scientific proof for Lord Rama's existence, nor did it dismiss it as superstition. In 1939, a girl named Shanti Devi claimed to be the reincarnation of Lugdibai. It created a sensation across the country. A 15 member committee was set up, to find the truth behind the matter by the greatest lawyer this nation has ever produced, Mahatma Gandhi. He didn't dismiss it as a superstition. In fact, according to the commission's findings, Shanti Devi was indeed a reincarnation of Lugdibai. I'm submitting the photographs and documents related to that case. There was no scientific proof in that case either. Similarly, my client is a reincarnation of Shyam Singha Roy. And he rewrote his own stories. There is no copyright violation in this case, Your Honor. Facts can be proved, but this is truth. It doesn't have any proof. The final judgment is adjourned for tomorrow. The verdict regarding the sensational case of Shyam Singha Roy's reincarnation is due today. After hearing the arguments from both sides, due to the lack of logical and scientific evidence regarding this case... Sorry, sir. A small request. -Who is he? -He is requesting to meet you. Let him in. Considering a personal request from someone related to this case, I hereby allow a witness to appear in the court before the verdict is delivered. Uncle? It's Manoj Roy! S-Shyam. Shyam. Mr. Manoj Singha Roy, please tell the court what you want to say about this case. Vasudev is Shyam Singha Roy. I believe that my brother, Shyam, has been reincarnated as Vasu. I firmly believe it. He is Shyam Singha Roy. What are you saying, Uncle? Silence in the court, please! Please! Thank you. Pardon me, Your Honor. Mr. Roy... You are claiming that your brother, Shyam, who died 45 years ago, has been reincarnated as Vasudev. You are 85 years old. It's your belief. Fine! But why should I, and the honorable judge, this court, and the public believe you? Can you give me one good reason why? Do you have any evidence to prove that Vasu did not plagiarize Shyam Singha Roy's stories? Do you have any substantial proof of Shyam Singha Roy's reincarnation? I'm asking you, Mr. Roy. Please tell me. The court wants to know. Yes, I have. I have proof. A secret which I was likely to take to my grave, the venomous side of the Singha Roy family, has been revealed by someone in the court. I was shell-shocked by that. Anyone can plagiarize from the published books. But there's a short story that has never been published. And no one knows about its existence, except for me. It's a short story that Shyam Singha Roy personally handed over to me. How could Mr. Vasudev make it as a short film? Who gave that story to him? A small story. The story is... She has been passionate about painting since her childhood. This is the only copy of that story, written by Shyam himself. VARNAM The same story was made as a short film by Vasudev. How is that possible? As the Chairman of SR Publishers, I withdraw this case. Because he is not just the owner of these three stories. He's the owner of the whole company. Since the petitioners have withdrawn the case, the case is closed. I didn't lose, but you have won. Good job. I'll see you in court again. All the best. Mannu. Please forgive me, Shyam. I was responsible for your death. I didn't know that our brothers would do that to you. You were very stubborn. That's why you are born again. Your stories found their way back to you. Your stories saved you. This company, all the assets... It all belongs to you. Take it. What should I do with them? I promised Rosie that I would spend a lifetime with her. But I left her midway. Rosie must have waited for me until her last breath. I don't know why I was reborn. Rosie... Rosie is alive. She is waiting for you. You mean, Rosie... Is very much alive. I hid her in my uncle's village. I asked her to live with us after our brothers passed away. But she refused. SHYAMA DANCE SCHOOL She is strong-willed. That's why you have been born again. I guess, I'm still alive only to pass on this news to you. I want to die on a new moon day like this, lying on your lap, staring at you in my last moments with a smile on my lips. That's my final wish. Come away with me, Rosie.
