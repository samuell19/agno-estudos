Buon compleanno, Nonna Campisi. Grazie, everyone. This... This is so nice. Antonio, the pasta was perfetto. Just like my Marco used to make. He taught you well. - Bravo! - I am so glad you like it, Signora. It means the world to me. And look at this cake. Magnifico! Make a wish. Ah! Did it work? You've always been young at heart, Nonna. I tried. Well, happy birthday, Nonna. Enjoy your cake. Buon compleanno, Nonna. I made you some giandiotto chocolates with fresh hazelnuts from my family's orchard. Grazie, Ginny. Your friend is always so thoughtful. I don't know what I would do without her. And I don't know what I would do without you, Nonna. Marco was so happy when you decided to follow him from Italy to open Cibo. And I am so grateful that you stayed, even after he passed away. Well, you are my family. I am not going anywhere. Your pastry chef really outdid herself on this one. Actually... Christina called in sick today, so I made the cake myself. Seriously? It's so good! I had no idea you could bake like this. Remember, I told you I used to bake all the time with my mom back in Connecticut. I really loved it. Why don't you do it more? I don't know, I don't really have the time. Managing the restaurant, Sofia, life... Richard! You made it. We saved you some cake. Ah. Thank you. Happy birthday, Signora Campisi. Grazie. Can we talk privately? Of course. I'll be right back. Thank you. Doh je. Doh je. Doh je. Okay. Doh je. I can never thank you enough, Ben. You brought us back from the brink. Just doing my job. Okay. Hey, Jared. We're all set here. So I heard. Great job, as always. So, now you want to take a little time, see Hong Kong before you leave? Didn't come to Hong Kong for a vacation, Jared. Came to turn around a restaurant. I did that. Everyone needs a break at some point, Ben. Where to next? I just got a call from Richard Maitlin. He's majority owner of Il Cibo è Vita on Bainbridge Island, near Seattle. They opened up the place about ten years ago after discovering this incredible chef from Italy, and instant smash. Two Michelin stars within the first year, six-week wait for a table. Doesn't sound like they need my help. Well, that was before Chef Campisi passed away. It's been about th ree years now, and they're struggling. Yeah. That's a tough one to come back from. He's hired us to see if we can still salvage what they have before he has to sell. I'll see what I can do. I assume everybody involved is on board with the process? Of course. Great. Hang on. Hang on. So we're gonna let this person who we've never met, who never met Marco, just swoop in here, and turn everything upside-down? No, he's gonna turn things around. This guy has got a 100% track record. He's the best in the business. You should be excited. Well, if by "excited" you mean "sense of impending doom," you bet. I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but I don't have a choice. Cibo has to start turning a profit again, or I'm gonna have to sell my shares. It's a business decision. This is not just a business. It's a family. And it's a family you helped create when you brought Marco here all those years ago. I know. Watching the restaurant take off, seeing you two fall in love, have Sofia... I'm so proud I even had a little to do with that. And you know I've done everything I can to keep these doors open. I know. I do know that. And I appreciate it. But I'm a real-estate investor, Elizabeth. I never planned on owning a restaurant, but I took a chance because... I knew Marco was special. He was. And everything he created is still here. What if this person wants to come in here and take all of that away? He's not the enemy, Elizabeth. He's coming to help. What's that? Peach and almond crostata. That's a solid "yum." When are you gonna make it? One day, I will find the time. The good news is, I made sure we had plenty of time to go to the Artisan Festival today. I thought we could get there early and do a little shopping, then go visit Ginny at her booth. What's wrong? Don't you want to go? It's not that I don't want to go, it's just Anna texted me to see if I wanted to hang out with her and Mia there, and then go to Anna's house after. Oh. Are you mad? No, I am not mad. Of course, you should go with your friends. The festival goes for two weeks, so we can go another time. Thanks, Mom. Sure. I am so sorry, sir, but your room won't be ready for another hour. Oh. That's okay. While you're waiting, might I suggest walking over to the Artisan Festival? It's a wonderful event and today's the first day. Okay. Yeah. I'll check it out. Why not? Thanks. - Good morning. - Good morning. I just wanted to see how it was going so far. Great. Everyone really seems to like the new fudge. Where's Sof? She's off with her friends. Didn't want to come with me. Oh... Don't worry. She'll magically reappear once she gets hungry. I know it's hard, El, but she's getting more independent... It's a good thing, means she's growing up. Tch. You are a good friend. - Hi there. - Hi. Would you like to try a sample? This is our new hazelnut fudge. Every ingredient comes right from the island. This is literally the best chocolate in the entire country. Okay. Ginny's family's been making this since the 1920s. - Mm-hmm. - Wow. Hundred-year-old chocolate? Looks great. It's a life-altering experience. Okay, might be overselling it a little bit now. You are being kind of pushy. I'm just trying to help. No, no. It worked. Just fair warning, I'm not a "hazelnut" guy. Until now. - Can I get a bag? - Yes. - How much do I owe you? - Ten. Did I tell you, or did I tell you? You told me. I hope you're paying your friend a commission. Of course. Mm. Winner. You grow up here? Ginny did. Actually, we met as freshmen at UConn. Loudest roommate ever. Well, I had to be loud to drown out your ukulele. No, you didn't. Oh, it's okay. No shame. No shame here. I, too, also went through an ironic-ukulele phase. How many songs you learn? Uh, one. "What a Wonderful World." How did you know that? It's the only song I learned. Hey, Ginny. Hi! Wow. This is a friendly place, huh? Yeah, that was one of the first things I noticed when I came here to visit Ginny on a road trip 13 years ago. It's a really special place. Pretty much as soon as I got here, I knew this is where I belonged. The free chocolate doesn't hurt, though, right? Well, obviously. Here you go. Thank you. Oh, keep that. Oh, thanks. Just try not to eat all that in one sitting. Oh, I absolutely will. Oh. Ginny? I gotta go. I got a meeting. I got a meeting, too, actually. It was a pleasure meeting you. Yeah, you too. Thank you for the chocolate. Of course. - You guys take care. - Bye. Okay. Wish me luck. I have to go meet with this restaurant consultant that Richard recommended. You can't leave yet. We haven't even talked about ukulele guy. There's nothing to talk about. I was trying to help my best friend make a sale. If we have to close Cibo, will you hire me? Yes. But I know I'm not gonna have to. Good luck. Hey. Me again. You look lost. Yeah. Yeah, I got a special talent for starting out in the wrong direction using this walking app. Well, I can probably help you. Where are you going? Uh, Il Cibo è Vita. You know it? Of... course I do. Everyone does. I mean, it's probably the best Italian restaurant in the Pacific Northwest. I mean, maybe even the entire country. Okay. Well... I was told it used to be. Straight down that way, turn left, two doors down on the right. Can I help you? You're Elizabeth Campisi. I am. And Marco Campisi was my husband. I'm so sorry for your loss. There's nothing harder. Thank you. And I want to apologize if I was harsh back there. I didn't mean to imply that Cibo was not good. Well, you didn't imply it. You flat-out said it. To be fair, you could've told me who you were. I guess I wanted to see what I was up against and now I know. Ms. Campisi? I'm here to help. Believe it or not, I'm on your side. Together, you and I can help Cibo find its way again. By changing everything about it that made it great? By identifying the things that might be holding you back. And what if, when you're done, there's nothing left? I promised Marco that I would keep his vision alive, and keep our Cibo family together. Everyone here is counting on me. Look, I've been doing this a very long time. Believe me when I say that I understand that the restaurant is not just brick and mortar, it's your heart and your soul. Yes. And so is everyone inside it. I won't forget that. Okay. So, do I just tell my staff you're in charge now, or what? No, no. You just keep doing what you normally do. I'll be observing the front and the back of the house until I get an understanding of what I'm dealing with here. What you're "dealing with" is the vision of Marco Campisi, the greatest chef to ever come out of Northern Italy. Ben, this is, uh, Chef Antonio. He came here to Bainbridge with Marco all those years ago, as his protege. It's a pleasure to meet you, Antonio. I've heard wonderful things about you from Richard. I gotta say, I admire your willingness to stay faithful to Marco's original recipes... It's a stand-up thing to do. Everything I am, I owe to that man. It's the least I can do. Well, I am very excited to try everything for myself. What do you say we start with three of Cibo's best-selling dishes? - Yeah? - Right now? Right now. No time like the present. I'm not sure we'll have time before the dinner rush. I wouldn't call it a "rush." Carla. You know, I think we can make that work... - Good. - If we start right away. Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Ben Elliott, and my job is simply to help restaurants reach their full potential. Now, without sounding too proud, I have had some success all over the world, and there's no reason why we can't do the same thing here, with a beautiful place like Cibo. Is he waiting for us to cheer or something? I can hear you. Uh... I think he might actually be here to help, so, let's give him a chance, okay, guys? Thank you. Antonio, you want to get us going? Okay, everyone, we'll start with the antipasti... Go prepare the bruschetta. I'll get started on the carne cruda. I want everyone else either on prep or out of the way. Adesso! Let's go! Thanks, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you. Coagulated before you put it in the pasta, okay? Most of our guests begin with the antipasti board... Bruschetta, carne cruda, piave cheese. Here is a butternut squash risotto... All of the squash is sourced locally here on the island. Next up, we have a customer favorite... Fresh lobster ravioli with crabmeat cream sauce. Finally, Marco's signature dish... This is tagliolini with a sun-dried tomato pesto. It's an homage to his roots in Northwest Italy. Mm. Hmm. It's incredible, isn't it? Yeah, it's delicious. Absolutely. The tomatoes are flown in, direct from Piemonte. Italy? That seems incredibly expensive for something you can source locally, no? Well, the thing is, this dish, including these particular tomatoes, this is what made Marco famous. So we can't change it. Promise me you won't ask me to change it. Well, I can't make any promises, but I'll do my best to make it work. The other thing here is I see that the tomatoes are being used on... five other dishes that aren't selling nearly as well. The best thing we can do here is to simplify this entire menu. Or maybe we can just get rid of the whole thing and serve spaghetti with sauce from a can? That would save lots of money. We will take a look at our sun-dried tomato expenditures. Thank you. Is this the way the tables have always been arranged? Yes. Huh. What are you writing? It's just shorthand, so I remember my thoughts. So you're having thoughts that you aren't sharing with me? Because I would like to hear them... if we're "in this together." We are. We are. I've just found it best not to hit my clients with all the ideas at once. Tends to make 'em feel overwhelmed. I've already been overwhelmed for the last three years. Elizabeth, can you and I go talk somewhere alone? - That's a good idea. - Okay. This way. Oh, Nonna. This is Ben Elliott. He's the restaurant consultant that I was telling you about. This is Marco's mother, Signora Campisi. It's an honor to meet you. I'm so sorry for the loss of your son. Not as sorry as you will be if you try to change the tagliolini recipe. You heard us talking about that? Sì. I won't change it. You have my word. Grazie. Well, enjoy your dinner, Nonna. So I thought you said you couldn't make promises. I know. But that was kind of scary. Can we just start over? Please. Let's go for a walk. So, how did you end up doing this for a living? Uh, in college, I worked at a restaurant that was struggling to keep its doors open. I came up with a few good ideas. They listened, it worked. The success got a lot of attention, and I guess I found my calling. Did you ever want to open a restaurant of your own? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Almost did. Yeah, San Diego. Didn't work out. Listen, um, as far as Cibo's concerned, we're just gonna concentrate on the things that, uh, that made it special, you know? You're speaking in the past-tense again. It is special. Yeah, listen. You're absolutely right. Okay? We just need to get people to find a reason to come back, see it for themselves. Well, then let's get started. Good. Come on. Your turn. No. Come on. No. You can't wish away the bad things that happen in life. Doesn't stop some people from trying. There's a lot of hope in these coins. Doesn't hurt to put it out in the universe. There. Did it. - You happy? - Yes. So happy. Unless you wished for me to get sucked into a black hole or something awful like that. You know what, I thought about it. But then how would I explain that to the authorities? Yeah, how would you? Nah. I just wished for everything to be okay. Well, there. Now your wish got some backup. Thank you. Just here to help. What's the matter? Nothing. Sweetheart. I can tell there's something's wrong. Come here. Come talk to me. It's just... I found out that Anna and Mia didn't really want to invite me to the festival. Anna's mom made her because she still feels sorry for me. For us. Oh... Sof. And the worst part is, I don't even know if I want to be friends with them anymore. What? Why not? We sit together at lunch, and she and Mia don't even look up from their phones. And the dumbest part is, they're texting each other. I just wish everything was the way it used to be. Mm. I know. I wish that, too. But things don't always go the way we planned. I think you and I know that better than anyone, don't we? I bet there are a lot of girls at your school who would love to get to know you better. Yeah, until I tell them about Dad, and they give me the "sad" look. Then we are just gonna have to show them we are doing fine. Okay? We should also consider starting an aperitivo hour with wine pairings. But I thought you wanted to streamline the menu. Yes, to make room for new specials that are easy to promote. And before you go blind trying to read what I wrote, what I wrote was, "open-concept kitchen... " question mark. Open-concept kitchen? - That's right. - Marco used to say open kitchens make him feel like an exhibit at the zoo... Like a monkey with knives and a white hat. Okay. Well, look. I've had the pleasure of watching you cook, Antonio... And you've got a rhythm and a flow. It's like watching a conductor with a symphony. Why not let people be a part of something beautiful like that? It's just not what Marco wanted. Excuse me, I need to get more olive oil. Hey, what do you mean? Where's the rest of it? Well, I was supposed to get it yesterday, but after making the menu samples for Ben, I didn't get the chance. Who's your supplier? Signore Petrunti. He's not an official supplier, per se... He's a friend of Nonna Campisi's from the old country and his olive oil is the best of the best. - I'll run out. - Actually, no. It's almost your break. Um, we'll just go. Are you sure? You know what you have to do? I know. I'll be fine. Come on. So... what exactly do you have to do to get this special olive oil? Well, Signore Petrunti has his own unique way of doing business. It's a very delicate negotiation. - Okay. - Just come with me. - You got to do something. - Signore. Elizabeth! How are you? Ah, fine, fine. Where's Antonio? He's at the restaurant. I'll be handling the order today. Who's this guy? I'm Ben. How're you doing? Nice to meet you. He's just observing. You know how this works, huh? The lower your score, the more you pay. - Capisce? - Of course. Bene. Scopa! Is she winning? Yes. Scopa! Scopa! I'm just getting lucky. Mm. Here's your price. No. That was the price last time, and I know Antonio didn't win as many rounds as me. You're good at this, huh? Go get her a case of olive oil. Elizabeth, it's a pleasure doing business with you. We'll see you next month. Is this gonna be enough? - Grazie. - Can we have the rest delivered? Of course. - Grazie. - G razie. - Ciao. - Ciao. Okay. That was a little bit impressive. Scopa's not that hard to learn. Not the game! - The way you charmed those guys. - Charmed them? And stood your ground with Signore Petrunti, and worked him over for... For his olive oil. Can you do the same thing with tomatoes, though? See? That's your trouble, Ben. You still think this is about overhead and profits. Unfortunately, when it's all said and done, it is. The question is, is how do we get to where we need to be? Well, whatever we do, it can't come at the expense of what made Cibo great. It's the relationships. Everything we do comes from the heart, and I don't want to lose that. Otherwise, what are we even doing here? Aside from basking in the glory of your sweet, sweet victories? You know what I mean. I do. All right. These bad boys are nice and safe. Thank you. Do you want me to drop you off at home? Or your place, wherever you're staying? Yeah, the Bainbridge Pines Inn. If you don't mind. I just realized, I don't even know where home is for you. I don't have one of those, I don't think. I do have an apartment in New York, where I leave all my stuff when I'm gone. Does that count? Don't you ever want to settle down somewhere? I came close once. When I was engaged. Didn't work out. Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, it's fine. It's okay. It's in the past. Don't you get tired, moving from place to place? No, no. I love what I do. There are few things better in this world than seeing your client realize that everything's gonna be okay. Or maybe your job is just an elaborate ruse to get free food all over the world. Uh-oh. She's on to me. Sofia, you're gonna be late for school! I don't feel good. I don't think I should go to school today. Oh, no. Do you have a cough? A sore throat? Let me see if you have a fever. It's just a stomach ache. I just don't want to go, okay? Oh. Sofia, did something happen at school with Anna and Mia? No. I totally avoided them. I think maybe something happened. Lunch was hard. Mm, yeah. I bet it was. Who did you end up sitting with? I went to the art room and painted. Sweetheart, I'm sure there was someone you know that you could have had lunch with. But what if nobody wants me to sit with them? Okay. I know this is scary, but, sometimes, if we want things to change, we have to be the one to make the first step. Good morning. Good morning! I'm at the restaurant. It's locked. Well, that's because we're closed on Mondays. Remember? We give the staff a day off, because they all work weekends. Well, that's very kind of you to be giving up 15% of your potential profit. This is the way we've always done it. It's part of why the staff is so loyal. We're like a family. In fact, a lot of them come to my house for Monday Dinner. Everyone is invited, and you can... uh... you can come, if you want. No, no, no. I wouldn't want to impose. I was just throwing it out there. Then again, it might not be a bad idea to get to know the staff a little bit better. Never know where a good idea might come from. So... it's like a business dinner. Yeah. Exactly. Great. What can I bring? Pants with a forgiving waistband. Hi, Ginny. Elizabeth! What brings you in? So I was going through my drawers, and I found this old recipe of Nonna's, for Torta alla Monferrina. Ooh. Apples, pumpkin, figs, brandy... chocolate. And chocolate is the one thing I don't have. Do you happen to know where I could find some? I think I have you covered. Look at you... Baking twice in one week. When was the last time you did that? I can't even remember. It had to be before Marco and I opened Cibo. It's good to see you finally finding the time to do something you love again. That's just it... I don't have the time. I just forgot to assign someone to bring dessert tonight, and I already happened to have most of the ingredients. Except I was thinking about adding just a hint of espresso... - Mm! - Just to give it my own twist. And I'm gonna make sure that Ben knows that I used local figs, because I want him to see how much we value farm-to-table. That's why you suddenly found the time to bake a special dessert. You invited Ben tonight! Yes. In a professional capacity. You know, no one would judge you if you started dating again. We all want you to be happy. I will be happy once I know that Cibo is okay. That's not what I'm talking about, and you know it. Well, that doesn't mean that I want to talk about it. Marco's legacy is all that matters. That's not the only thing that matters. It's your life, too, and you're allowed to live it. I am. No. You're living Marco's life. Well, it was our life. But what do you want? You know what I want? I want to have one day where I am not worried about the future or thinking about the past. That's what I want. Hard to do when you're still wearing your wedding ring. Can we go back to just talking about chocolate? Sure. Take whatever you need from the stock in back. Thanks. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? I was just getting, uh, some wine. That's a great choice. We actually have that on our wine list. Did you have to beat the owner at Scrabble to get a case? I think it was Parcheesi. Ahh! All right, I better get back to work. I can't have my client thinking that I'm gallivanting around town. I feel like you don't do much gallivanting in general. Everyone deserves time for themselves. Is that what you're doing? Me? No, no. I'm just picking up supplies for tonight. I don't really make time for time. Well, it sounds like we should both attempt to go a minute without work. Right now? Phones away. Okay. Go. What do you think about live music at the restaurant? See? I knew you couldn't do it. I know, I've got a problem. Come on. What do you think? [ukulele playing[ ♪ Red roses, too ♪ ♪ And I see them... ♪ Did you set that up? No. No. ♪ And I think to myself ♪ ♪ What a wonderful world ♪ Uh, I've got to get everything ready for tonight. I should go. Yeah, I should do some work before dinner. - Okay, I'll see you later. - Bye. Hi. Wow. Hi. You found it. Yeah, got rid of the app. Followed my nose. Come in. Yeah. Sure. Thank you for this. It's a potluck, so everyone brought something. Oh, good, thanks for telling me. I appreciate that. Ben's here. - Ciao! - Hi, Ben. - Ciao! - Buona sera, Ben. Grazie. I appreciate you guys letting me join you. It's very kind. I'm surprised anybody's happy to see me. That's nice. It's Monday dinner. We leave the outside world at the door. Ah. Sofia? This is Mr. Elliott. He is a restaurant consultant. Hi. For Cibo? Why? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I'm just here to help out a little bit. It's nice to meet you, Sofia. What's this? Oh, I'm just doodling. Doodling? No, no, no. This is not a doodle. This is, uh... this is beautiful. Yeah, she's a really good artist. Sofia, can I ask you a question? Would you be comfortable if your mother used this in one of her menus? That's a great idea. I'm disappointed I didn't think of it myself. Antonio! What are you making tonight? Ravioli al baccalà con crema di bufala, cipolla rossa e pomodorino candito. It's a, uh... cod ravioli with buffalo cream, red onion, and candied cherry tomato. It's a... piattino. A small plate. Here. Try it. - Oh, you want me to try it? - Sì. Cheers. Mm! This is stunning. Why have I never seen this on a Cibo menu? Oh, it's not. It's, uh, just my twist on a recipe I learned growing up. Yeah, this is very good. Uh, my concierge at the hotel mentioned something about a chef's competition at the Artisan Festival? What of it? Well, I hope you're entering. I don't think that's a good idea. Antonio. We should at least consider adding this to one of the specials. Refreshing the menu's one of the most important things we can do here. Here. Ben. You stir. - Stir? - Sì. Sure. Thank you. Tch-tch-tch-tch. Let me show you something. Okay. Sure. You should do... like this. Yeah? You want me to lift it up like that? Sì. Okay. I got that. I can do that. No problem. Just do that. - Bring it up like this, right? - Mm. She's messing with me? Okay. Good. Appreciate that. It's okay. You want me to stir this or not? - No. - No? No, I know what you're doing. Careful, those are very long pieces. Oh... ha, ha. What am I missing here? Nothing. Nothing. Elizabeth here committed one of the biggest sins in Italian cooking. Is that right? What'd you do? - I did not. - Did you use sauce from a jar? Worse! What could be worse than that? Nonna, come on. Do we have to talk about this? It was ten years ago. Oh, I think this is the perfect time to talk about this. What do you guys think? - Uh, yes. - Mm-hmm. I do! She's in. Here we go! Okay. Fine. So... it was Nonna's first time visiting and I wanted to impress her... Oh, you impressed her, all right. I could help in the kitchen... So when it came time to put the spaghetti into the pot, Elizabeth took the pasta... She held it over the pot... And before any of us could stop her... I... broke the spaghetti in two. Mom! Oh, no! Even Sofia knows you don't do that. Sofia's half-Italian. Oh, the cracking sound... It was terrible. I almost fainted. I'll bet you did. Well, needless to say, I learned my lesson. Now... I cut my spaghetti with scissors. Okay, okay. Here. Have a little more No, no, no. Grazie, grazie. Yeah, yeah, you like the potatoes. This is where I draw the line. There's no more room in there. The secret is to say you're full one helping before you actually are. Mm-hmm. I wish I'd known that an hour ago. I'm... I'm gonna start getting everything ready for dessert. Okay. It's okay to start, Ben. - Mangia. - N onna. Finally. All right. Mm. - Nonna? - Mm-hmm? This might be one of the best desserts I've had. Now I know where your son gets it. I did not bake this. You? Mm-mm. No... You've been holding out on me. You bake? I used to, when I was little. I'll try it. Now it's just sort of a hobby that I never seem to find time to do. Elizabeth! Ooh! Whose recipe is this? You know, actually, it's a twist on your recipe, Nonna. I hope you don't mind, I changed it up just a little bit. Of course, I don't mind. Sometimes... change makes the things better. You made it your own. Ben fatto! Excuse me? Ben... "ben fatto," it means "well done." Ahh. Well, in that case... Ben is a fatso. Come here. No, I can't. I can't have any more. You guys are gonna have to roll me out of here. However, I am very glad that you made time to bake this today. We all are. Yeah. Not a bad way to spend a Monday night. No, it's not. I can't remember the last time I felt this way. About a meal, I meant. I can't even describe it. We call it, La gioia della tavola. "The joys of the table." That's lovely. That's lovely. You guys have a wonderful family. I hope you know that. I didn't have a big family growing up. Did not realize what I was missing until I came here. That means so much. Thank you. Well... that was, without a doubt, the best business dinner I've ever had. I almost forgot that's what it was. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for tonight. - Uh, goodnight. - See you tomorrow. Okay. Oh, Richard. Hi. I'm so sorry. I thought our status meeting was this afternoon. I needed to see you sooner. Things have changed. Well, they're about to... Isn't that the whole point of all this? Actually... the other restaurant group moved up the deadline on their offer. They need an answer in three weeks. Three weeks? That's not enough time to turn Cibo around. Even if we followed all of Ben's suggestions, that's not enough time. I know. Which is why I'm going to take their offer while it's still on the table. I have no choice. I'm sorry. You can't do this to us. After everything we've been through? I mean, what am I... What am I gonna tell everyone? What am I gonna I tell Sofia? You're taking away the only thing we have left of Marco. Believe me... I have no choice here. Times are tough for everyone. How much are they offering? 250,000. Well, I don't want to sell. I will take out a loan and buy out your share. If you could do that, nothing would make me happier. But... it's not realistic. Why not? I've been in business a long time and no bank is going to lend money to a business that's already on the brink. I truly wish things were different. It has been a tough year... and I really have no choice, Elizabeth. I understand. I'm so sorry. Thank you. So make sure you get room 206 room service... Continental breakfast. Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Elliott. Good morning, Charlotte. Early start today? Yeah, I thought I'd walk around town before I head into Cibo. Huh. The island's really growing on you, eh? Yeah, I suppose it is. Have a good day, okay? Don't work too hard! Thank you. Hey, Jared. What's up? Elizabeth? Oh. Hi. I heard about the offer getting moved up, that Richard's taking it. Yeah. So I guess that means you're out of a job. I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about you. I'll be fine. I just need $125,000 in the next three weeks. You speak to the bank? Apparently, it will take some kind of miracle for them to loan me that type of money. No, no, no. They just need a compelling reason. We can still give them that. "We"? Aren't you moving on? Never left a job until it was done. We're not done yet. I can't pay you the type of money that Richard did. It's on the house. Do you do this for all your clients? Uh... .,..you're the first. Good morning. Oh! You're here early. I, uh, picked up some fresh salmon from a friend of mine this morning and thought I'd play around with some recipes. Well, if it's anything like you made the other night, I would be honored to be your test subject. What do we got? We have, uh, pan-roasted salmon puttanesca... Hmm. Pan-roasted salmon with herb gnocchetti in an olive vinaigrette... Okay. And salmon alla stimpirata. Hmm. Antonio, I've had some of the finest cuisine in the world. These three rank right up there. Thank you. So we'll put them on the menu. No. Antonio, you're killing me here. Look, I understand why Elizabeth is reluctant to make changes to what Cibo did in the past, but you seem just as reluctant, my friend. Why is that? Don't you want to make a name for yourself? Don't you want more? What I have here is already more than I could have ever dreamed of. Okay. Back in Italy, I was always getting myself into trouble. I knew cooking was my way out, but... I made some mistakes. I lost the money for tuition at culinary school. When Marco found this out, he paid my way. When he asked me if I'd come to the U.S. to open Cibo, it was the easiest decision I ever made. Everything I have is all because Marco Campisi believed in me. My way of thanking him is to keep his legacy alive. I understand. But isn't your talent... part of that legacy, too? This is my decision, Ben. This is how I've chosen to honor him. You can't honor him from a closed kitchen, Antonio. Listen to me. You are the key to everything here. Your food is how we bring Cibo back. Thank you for saying that, Ben, but I don't think Mrs. Campisi would ever be okay with changing the menu. I would never ask her to. It's her link to Marco, just like it is for me. Okay. Well, let me talk to her. What if she says no? Don't worry about that. You... just be ready. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay, pal. All right. Progress! You couldn't have just said, "Ben?" Guy asked for a name for the cup. "Cuppy." I think I would've gone with "Steve". Nah. Cuppy's cuter. So, I'm guessing you didn't want to meet today just to talk about paper products, did you? No. There's something else. Of course, there is. What is that? What's wrong? Did something happen? It's just, no, I'm... I'm just starting to see the writing on the wall, and it's a sign, and it says, "for lease". Not if I can help it. I talked to my friend, Gail. She's the loan officer at the bank, and Richard was right. They are not going to lend us a dime unless we have the same type of buzz we did before. Ah. Let's be honest, Ben. It's impossible to get that kind of buzz in three months, let alone three weeks. Not impossible. Hard, but not impossible. Look, Elizabeth, you have everything that you need to get back on top, right in front of you. You got the best chef on the island, maybe even the entire region, in your kitchen, and all you have to do is give him the freedom to show everybody else what we already know. And what we know is that he's a culinary genius. Mm-hmm, well, he learned from the best... and, honestly? He might be even better. But I asked him, two years ago, if he wanted to put his dishes on the menu, he said no... He wouldn't even discuss it. I think, if you asked him again, you might get a different answer. But first, you need to give him your blessing. He needs to know that you are okay making this change. Everyone keeps telling me to move on, let go, change. It's not that easy. It's not like I can just flip a switch. I know. Believe me, I know. Buon pomeriggio, Nonna. Mm. Mwah. Tch. Eh? I thought the double-cheek-kiss thing was reserved just for family. Campisi rule... You have a family dinner with us, you are family, so. Ah, ecco. It's done. - Grazie, Nonna. - We'd love to join you. We have to talk to Antonio, so we'll see you in a bit. She doesn't know what's going on with the business, - does she? - I'll have to tell her soon. She's not gonna like it when she finds out Antonio's making his own recipes, though. Antonio is going to be making his own recipes? Nonna... let me explain. No need to explain. I always hoped you would give Antonio a chance. I thought you would be upset. I'm just surprised it took that long. Marco never would have wanted his protege, his protetto, to be making the same recipes for his whole career. He would've wanted him to leave the nest and fly. Why didn't you say something sooner? I mind my own business. Pretty good for a mother-in-law, no? I don't know what I'd do without you. Mm! Okay. Let's go tell Antonio it's a "yes," shall we? Yes! Thank you, Nonna. No. I made a promise to Marco to keep things as they were. So did I, Antonio, but I think we were wrong. I don't think this is what Marco would have wanted in the long run. I can't just forget about him, Elizabeth. I create a new menu, there's nothing left. The menu's gonna have a "Campisi Classic" section... All of Marco's best dishes, just as they were. The rest is up to you. This is how we honor the past and embrace the future. Mrs. Campisi... if you and Nonna don't want me to do this, I won't. Nonna and I both think that you deserve the chance to shine. I know that's what Marco would've wanted and I'm just sorry that it took me so long to realize it. I've got this guy to thank for that. Just doing my job. Thank you. Both of you. Of course. The only trouble is we have just three weeks to get the word out, and it would usually take months to generate the type of buzz that we need. Not if this man enters the Battle of Bainbridge. The team from Coastside in San Francisco, they've won seven years in a row, and they just received their third Michelin star! I don't think I'm ready. I know you're ready. And so am I. It's time we turned the corner. Okay. Thank you. I just heard about the festival! Congratulations, Antonio. - Grazie. - I'm so happy for you. Thank you. This smells amazing. What is it? And can I have it all and not share it with anyone? It's a seared scallops with corn pudding and wild truffles, over a roasted chicken broth. Please, enjoy. Mm. Antonio, this is incredible. I've never tasted scallops like this before. This is definitely the recipe you should use in the competition. Oh, I can't make this for the competition. Why not? I'm out of the truffles. Let's go buy some more. On me. I appreciate that, but there is nowhere to buy them. These truffles are only harvested on this island, and once they're gone, they're gone. Unless we want to go hunt for any stragglers ourselves. Talking about a truffle hunt? I thought this only happened in Italy. Uh, actually, the latitude of Washington State is the same as the best truffle-growing regions in Italy. And probably a tenth of the price. What? It's a win-win. - You're hopeless. - I know. What do you want? So... let's go find some. Ben, why don't you join me? Absolutely. Elizabeth? Oh. Uh... Ginny, do you want to join us? I have to get back to the store. Okay. Then it's just us three. Great. So, now you know what to look for, let's hope we have some luck, huh? Okay, you two try this section over there... Okay. And I'll look up here. Andiamo. - Good luck. - You too. All right, let's see what we can do here. Hey, look, I want to say thank you. Why? For what? For being so open to all these changes. The hardest part of my job is getting someone to be open to change so that they can help themselves, that and knowing when to push, and not to push too far. You've been really courageous and I want to thank you for that. Well, I don't know. I wasn't really open to any changes at first. Yeah, you were guarded. Understandable, given everything that you've been through. Not everybody's as strong as you are. I didn't really have a choice. I had a lot of people counting on me, and... then I realized I could count on you. Yeah. Absolutely. Whoo-hoo! Ben! Elizabeth! Come. I found them. Should we go? Sure. We're coming! Sofia! This is beautiful. Wow! I wonder if my dad would've liked it. I'm sure your dad would've loved it. From what I'm told, your dad was a true artist, and so are you. You're keeping his legacy alive. You should be very proud. There's one more box in the back. Yeah, okay. Keep going. Antonio! Hey. I am so glad you're finally entering the competition. What took you so long? Uh, I just wanted to make sure that I was ready. That we all were. Mm! Well, I'm sure people will be very excited to see what you can do. I know Cibo needs a comeback. I truly hope this is the start of something big. Thank you. So do we. Oh, and what will you be offering for the dessert portion? We haven't decided yet. Okay, yeah, well, let us know as soon as you can. Absolutely. Yeah. Thank you. Is Christina gonna make her zuccotto cake? No, she just texted me. She's already baking something for Joli Plat. Can she do that? Yes, we're not her only clients. I am surprised you guys never had an in-house pastry chef. Well, we talked about bringing someone in, but then Marco passed, and we were just trying to stay afloat. Can you think of anyone else in Seattle who might be able to do it? Why are the two of you looking at me like that? Because you should be the person to make this dessert. Me? - Yeah. - Those two cakes you made were better than anything Christina ever did. They're so good, Mom! And professional quality. No. I'm not a professional pastry chef. That's okay. No, the future of our restaurant cannot hinge on something I do as a hobby! Isn't that how Marco got started cooking? For his friends, in his free time, just for fun? You can do that, too. No. Elizabeth... can I talk to you for a sec? - Sure. Yeah. - Okay. Come on. What if... this is actually what you're meant to do? It's so clear to me that everything's been leading to this. You can do this. Come on. It's gonna be fine. Sofia, what are you still doing up? It's so late. I was working on the menu board for tomorrow. Aw. That is beautiful. He's changing a lot at Cibo, isn't he? Well, I think in a good way, but yes. Does that make you upset? Because you know that none of this means that we're forgetting about your dad, right? I'm not upset, Mom. I'm happy. And Dad would've loved how happy this makes you. Well, you know what really makes me happy is seeing what an amazing person you are turning out to be. And your dad would be so proud of you. Now go to bed! Glad to see you coming into your own, Tony. Well, someone has to beat you one of these days. So, what are you making? Grilled Bay Shrimp with some Cajun-glazed jam... Are you sure about this? Positive. Hey. Deep breath. You got everything you need. Okay? Well, folks, it is going to be hard to top yesterday's four entries, but... these four teams are going to try! You have two hours to complete your entrees and desserts, and present it to our judges. And please join me in welcoming this year's very special guest judge, Carmen Costa! Thank you! Thank you! Okay, I'm way more nervous now. I'm not. Okay, maybe a little. Thank you for making the dessert, Elizabeth. It really means a lot to me. I'm honored. Let's go win this thing. For Marco. And for ourselves. All right, it's time! Let's begin! Uh, problem! What's wrong? The burner's not working. What? What's going on? - The burner's not working! - Okay, okay. All right. Well, can we... can we fix it? These things are kind of finicky. - You gotta take 'em all apart. - Well, we don't have time! I still need to finish the sauce. Yeah, I know. Hang tight. Stay here. Here, let me look at it. Hi, Chef. My name is Ben. Okay! Grab the sauce. Let's go over. - Switch places? - Yeah. Go ahead. It's all yours. I can't thank you enough. - Yeah. - Thank you so much. We're already done and your friend explained what's at stake... We're happy to help. Thank you. Thank you. Okay... Okay. Almost there. Good luck. - Okay, I'm gonna go finish. - Sure. Ready? Andiamo. This looks wonderful. - Grazie. - Thank you. This looks amazing. Did you try... Would you like to try Chef Antonio's Seared Scallops... Here you are, sir. - Thank you. - Enjoy. Who's that? My friend from school. We've been working on a graphic novel during lunch. I'm gonna bring her a piece of your torta. Be right back. Sure! Oh... all this time, I thought she was just hiding from her problems in the art room. Turns out she was just finding where she really belongs. Yeah, I think that's going around. Cheers. Enjoy, my friend. This has been the most competitive year we have seen in a long time, but we can only crown one winning restaurant's culinary team. For the eighth year in a row, the grand prize goes to Chef Hill and Pastry Chef Levitz, from Coastside San Francisco. It's my fault. I'm so sorry. - It wasn't good enough. - No. No. Antonio, your dish was perfection. It's just my dessert, it wasn't up to par. Oh, yours was great. We did the best we could. Your dish was extraordinary, Chef. Grazie. Coming from you, that's a huge compliment. And I loved your dessert. Thank you. Personally, I thought you should've won. You had my vote. I can't wait to try the rest of your menu. I'll be sure to come in soon. Thank you. Well, the only problem is, there probably won't be a restaurant for her to come to. Oh... We didn't win. The bank has nothing to go on. I'm sorry. It's over. I'm so sorry, guys. I... I can't even believe it. I was sure you would win. We were really hoping that we would. Are you seeing this? Look at this! Oh. "Il Cibo..." best food in Washington." Hmm! It gets better. Look at the hashtags. "Il Cibo è Vita is back!" I don't understand How is this possible? We lost. Maybe Carmen posted something? I don't know, if she did, I can't find it. There's too much going on here. Look. This is all from regular people trying your food. Mamma mia! It's better than winning. This is exactly what we needed. This is, uh, word of mouth. At the speed of light! - That's right. - Guys, we're almost full for tomorrow night! Brava! How is that possible? Okay, look, we need to squeeze in as many people as we can. Also, let's get a multi-course tasting menu for the whole weekend. - Okay. Let's get started. - Let's do it. Good! And you... will be making the desserts. Desserts. Plural? Mm-hmm. You have so many recipes, Mom! You can do it! - I can... - Yes. But I think I'm gonna need a little help. I don't know. This might do it. I don't think you need me anymore. But that doesn't mean I don't still want you there. These are little... I was going to say I'm down to do strawberries. High five. Do this one with the powdered sugar. How are things? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Those look great. Beautiful, Nonna. My goodness, my goodness. - Very complementary. - Thank you. That's a pasta plate. Are you enjoying the food, everyone? Great. Eh, look who it is! The food is good? That's great. So happy to hear it. Enjoy. Antonio, everyone loves your food. I'm so happy for you. When the dessert course is served, they'll go crazy for that, too. Thank you. I think Marco would have loved the new layout. - You think? - Mm-hmm. I just feel like they're part of a big family. I just want everybody to feel what I did at Monday Dinner. And what did you feel? Like I was home. Who's that? That's Gail, from the bank. Really? I didn't know that she was gonna be here tonight. This is a very good thing. This is exactly what she needs to see. Here, look, why don't you go talk to Gail? I'm gonna get some more wine. - Okay. - Okay. And I called and called and called until I finally got through to make a reservation. I'm so glad you did! Everything so far is amazing. And I love that there's still a spot on the menu for Marco's classics... It's just perfect. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. So... what do you think? Do you think we have a chance at getting that loan? I think you can be cautiously optimistic. Whoa. You have no idea how happy that makes me. Cautiously! Cautiously happy. Good. There is one possible bump the bank might have. Sure, yeah. What's that? We understand you used a professional consultant to spearhead this turnaround. Ben Elliott. Yes. Since Richard is also not in the picture, you'll need to reassure the bank that, going forward, you'll be able to maintain all this on your own. Ben inspired so many wonderful changes around here, and I will be forever grateful for that. He pushed me to my limit, in the best way possible, but... his job is done. I have it from here. We've just been through so much upheaval in the last few years, and it's time for some stability, and I'm ready. Music to a banker's ears. Give me a call on Monday. I'm sure we can work something out. That sounds wonderful. Can I get you more wine? - Yes. - Okay. Be right back. Oh. Where are you going? Greece, actually. I'm on the red-eye out of Seattle. Oh. You have to go tonight? I do, Signora. I've done everything I can here. The restaurant's in great hands. You guys have a lot to celebrate. And we want you to stay and celebrate, too. Don't you and Elizabeth have more to talk about? I think it's time for me to go. Hey... we are family, remember? Of course. It's truly been my honor, Signora. Ciao. Nonna. Have you seen Ben? He had to go. Go where? To run an errand? Catch a plane. He left? Without saying goodbye? I just don't understand this. I thought you and Ben... I thought so, too, but we never really talked about it. Guess he didn't feel the same way. Of course, he did! There was something special happening between you two. We all saw it. Well, he left, Ginny. That tells me everything I need to know. The desserts look beautiful, Elizabeth. - Thank you. - I am so proud of you. Oh, mia cara. I don't think Ben wanted to go. Well... Wait. When we... When we were looking for truffles, he told me that he always does what he thinks is the right thing for someone, even if they don't understand it at the time. Do you think that could that be it? There's only one way to find out. I have to go find him. Sì. Go. We got this. Thank you. Thank you. Mrs. Campisi. Congrats on the battle. Everyone on social's still talking about you. You know, I can't even get a reservation. Thank you. Yeah. We're still catching up. Um... just out of curiosity... Would you have any idea if Ben Elliott has checked out yet? You know I can't share that kind of information. It's a privacy thing. Right. No. Of course not. Uh... oh, wow. Look at that. There was just a cancellation for tomorrow night. Of course, if a guest were to check out this late, they'd probably already be on the ferry back to the Mainland. Okay. Thank you, Charlotte.

Ben, I was talking about the business. No, I know that. I know that. But, um... I understand what you're going through, more than you realize. Well, then help me understand. Uh... I told you I was engaged, right? I don't think I mentioned that she died. Oh... Ben. That's okay. It was a long time ago. But I've been thinking and, uh... I think I realized that, when I started this job, I got a lot of joy... from helping people get their lives back, but I think that's maybe because, um, I couldn't have mine. Then I met you. I saw you go through the same thing. You stayed. You stuck around, you stuck to it. You fought for your future. You helped me realize, in order to move forward... I had to release some of my past.
