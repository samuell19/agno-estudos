The legend tells that in the middle of the fifteenth century the cruelest of dragons darkened the skies of southern England and caused terror to reign there His name was Yuto This lasted until a brave knight named Arthur Miller killed Yuto, the last dragon of his kind finally bringing peace to the country But even death couldn't restrain the power of this beast With the help of an evil wizard his ghost returned to our world Go in search descendants of your killer said the wizard to the ghost of the dragon Capture their life force in this diamond A boy and a girl less than 50 years apart Repeat this cycle for five centuries and your own life force will be restored Thus, for 500 years Yuto did just that He terrorized the descendants of Arthur Miller to become a dragon again of flesh and bones Sorry, Yuto, but it all ends here I'm afraid it's you that end here I won't let you get trapped other souls What ? Nope ! I don't know how you escaped but you'll go back to the trunk Poor fool there is no hope without the dagger of light The what? Yes The only thing that can destroy the diamond and release the life force I shouldn't have said that Where is she ? hidden away where only a member of your family could find her I shouldn't have told you that either No matter ! You can't escape anymore of this trunk You will forever be bound in the realm between the worlds In the realm of shadow, of fear Let your spirit be captive of the mirrors! I'm sorry, Abigail GHOST THE GHOST WITH MIRRORS Winston Miller the owner and last heir still alive from Echoville Manor has just died Mr. Miller had been accused in 1970 of of William's disappearance, his grand-nephew in strange circumstances, to date not yet elucidated William was only 7 years old when he was seen for the last time by a butler Despite extensive and careful research His body has never been found If he claimed to be abroad at the time of the facts, Mr. Miller has all the same been charged with homicide Here at Messina Falls, the oldest still remember this event happened in their small town But for most residents, this is a long forgotten episode Winston Miller would have no known living relatives so the mansion will go to local banks if no one shows up It was Samantha Randall, for TV 3 To you the studios Is that all that's left of the store? Yes Too bad we have to close it Your mom would never let that happen Here Thanks EVICTION NOTICE And the electricity is off Good.. then you will have to eat all that ice before it melts OK ? It's a good plan Let's go It's time to sell these very first editions No You don't have to do this Why collect them, if they useless when needed? I would feel..

Dear Abigail we regret to inform you than your great-uncle, Winston Miller is dead I didn't know mom had a great-uncle After much research it turned out that you are her last surviving relative As is you are to this day the only heiress of the manor of Echoville at Messina Falls who belongs to your family since 1685 In this photo, it says 1975 A manor ? Goalkeeper Juan Sanchez will give you the keys in the next few days It's just signed.. E.M.? It's true ? I mean..

There is not a moment to lose I looked what I found on the mansion Not much A few blogs that say it's haunted Dad, please You don't believe all this nonsense? Of course not So much the better So.. I have thought carefully about the different options that are available to us OK So, either we settle directly at Ecoland Echoville Echoville And we make it our home Obviously we might feel a little lonely in the middle of all these empty rooms Maybe we could rent some We could Or.. I could do a recording studio and invite artists from all over the world coming to record their albums and we could feed and house them And when I should go back to school at the end of summer? Or we could do not rejoice too quickly OK, either option B: we put it up for sale We could surely make enough money to repay the bank vultures and we would have enough to start a new life You haven't decided to sell, have you? No, it's that.. I wish mom was here She is still with us Sure, you don't want to come? Yes, I'm going for a walk OK. Don't get lost Come back here! It will turn to the next!

Nothing It's my game There was a jump scare Less noise or I confiscate it to you OK You have to keep your calm Are you going to hurt me? Nope I just want to talk to you You have to help me Who are you ? It does not matter Call me Ghoster for now Why are you there ? I jumped in the mirror of your bike in Echoville This mansion is truly haunted Hold on So, it's haunted here too, now? Oh no ! Dad is going to kill me He just redid the kitchen This house is not haunted At least, I don't think so Listen, it is really very important You must not let the Oren sell the Echoville manor Why ? I've been trapped there for 50 years Since the ghost of a dragon named Yuto imprisoned me as I tried to destroy a diamond he had hidden He bound me to kingdoms between your world and mine imprisoning me in mirrors with a spell that can't be broken than with the dagger of light Can you repeat ? I got tricked Yeah By an evil spirit Understood When I tried to steal her diamond which is in Big Ben I have to defeat him And find the dagger of light.. Understood ...to free myself from mirrors I follow you And thus, to be able to destroy his diamond OK Something else ? It's for a show hidden camera, right? OK, Aaron! You can show yourself You got me good How do they do that? Is it a projection or what? This is not a joke So you are really real I assure you yes But how can I help? I need you to talk to Elizabeth Every time she sees me, she starts screaming It's really very annoying OK, but why do you have to talk to him? Well, I'll explain to you Hello, Mr Oren Elizabeth is there? Lizzy? Mateo is there She is in the kitchen Hi What's new ? Do you know the Día de los Muertos? The day of the Dead Yes a little bit Why ? It is believed that death is only part of life's journey and that it does not put an end to life, but that it creates a new life That's a nice take on things Yes, we dance and feast It brings us closer of the world of the dead Exact So when it happens strange things actually, they're not that weird Weird, how are you there? No, well, I'm weird, but for a very good reason I hope What I'm trying to say is.. Spit it out, will you? It had gone better when we rehearsed it last night, Mateo This is... ? You.. Elizabeth Here is.. Ghosting Sorry to scare you every time I wanted to introduce myself Well, now that it's settled, let's talk about serious things I need your help Keep calm there This is.. rather creepy Alright, everything in its time You cannot sell the mansion Why ? Say it slowly We have to wait for the next full moon so that the door to the other world in the basement appears And then ? You have to win extremely dangerous challenges and retrieve Yuto's Dagger of Light This is the only time to get there Good news: the next full moon is in three weeks A Friday the 13th It's scary I guess that's a bad omen So.. what is dagger light, and what is a Yuto? You forget the trials extremely dangerous Of course not It's the dagger of light And Yuto is a ghost dragon For centuries in order to reincarnate he steals the souls of the children of my family and locks them in his diamond Who is in the steeple of Big Ben, in London I know Big Ben is in London But it's not in the real London, but in an array of it The catch.. We don't know where he is Yes, it was hanging in the house but after the time i walked in to try to destroy the diamond someone picked it up Listen I don't have time for.. all that I have much to do to help my father renovate the mansion so i wish you good luck with all that You're welcome, I can't do it without you Looks like we're staying between men, Ghoster Do not take it badly but we will need of all possible gray matter to win the competitions extremely dangerous We have already talked about it It's true She is the brain and me, the muscles Exactly Fortunately, Yuto told me where the dagger of light was He told you how to defeat him? He doesn't seem to be a very intelligent ghost dragon You might change your mind after seeing the first proof Yes, chances are that we get crushed I'm not going to be able to crush this It's funny, but I'm not convinced You're welcome It's not just for me This is for all the lost souls trapped in Yuto's diamond It's my whole family I do not know I don't want to disappoint my father One minute You have three and a half weeks to sell the mansion, right? So we have time to help Ghoster and renovate the mansion Let's admit and that's just a guess.. But let's admit.. that I help you you will have to work hard to help us fix this place That works Perfect Where do we start? Good job There are only 27 pieces left to make Yes, Anita Yes it's good Bring him in and offer him a drink OK Mr Lee Sit down Thanks Time is running out, I will be brief I represent a large client We are urgently looking to acquire land in Messina Falls Our reasons are completely confidential but I assure you urgency is paramount I'll put you in touch with a salesperson We're interested in to a particular property The manor of Echoville From what I heard, are you about to buy it? We are only in the formalities It takes time I'm sure we can.. Speed ​​things up We hope to start work in two weeks Have a good day So.. if i sum up the story Yuto, a ghost dragon locked your life force in a diamond which is hidden in a painting in London but you don't know where is this table No, but even if I knew i need the dagger of light to break the diamond I learned it the hard way when i escaped and that Yuto surprised me in the painting He shut me up in mirrors If you're recluse in the mirrors of Echoville how could you go to Mateo? If one mirror passes in front of another, I can jump in So you can jump in that mirror? Yes Who is this ? My mother She is very beautiful She died a long time ago I am sorry Are there others like you? Are you talking about ghosts? Some but we are not all connected I am not able to locate it, if that's what you're asking How did you land here? Well, I was little I was 7 years old, I think I don't remember very well my parents are dead and I was sent to live here I was terrified So I was hiding almost every day One day I hid in the cellar and I never came back What happened ? It's a bit blurry I got hit by something Like a fly in a spider's web You didn't have any family? I had a very young sister She was barely six months old But she died, too It's so sad Sorry It's like that Thank you, Elizabeth So the cellar what's in it? The owl painting It's like the London painting with a difference You need a key to enter Here it is I do not understand anything Where should the key go? It's only at full moon the door appears If we have the key we can enter the table And the challenges are there What do you know about these events? That I can't win them alone It will be a team effort and to tell the truth, a matter of luck There are puzzles and traps where, let's say, you risk.. What ? End up like me OK You just need to know how to win them I would like to know more but the information between these four walls are limited I've gone through all the books here I know where to look Come on, come on! We're going to the city The wifi is terrible here Wi-Fi? I think you forgot a place Not you, anyway You are covered in dust I believe this chimney is filled with soot since the dawn of time It's a shame to sell this mansion I would like to do otherwise because this place is brimming with history When I was a child, it was my favorite painting When you were a kid? I thought this mansion was abandoned for 50 years? I'm going to take the air in town We need white paint And.. something to sand Count on me And ice cream If I understand, everyone has a device in their pocket who literally has the answer to all questions that we can ask ourselves since the beginning of mankind and almost everyone uses it to look at pictures of cats? Not to all questions I can't find anything on Yuto at all We have to keep looking Hi Sit down, Lizzie Due to your inability submit supporting documents within the time allowed all your belongings including the mansion, will be entered within seven days They do not have the right He gave you his word Alas, these vultures can do whatever they want They don't care of the plebs in our genus Something has to be done There is nothing to do It must ! Dad, you don't understand This seizure must be prevented Especially here, now We have to fight during the.. ... next eleven days Eleven days? And then what? Then what happens? The door to defeat Yuto will open Who said that ? Father ? Father ? Father ! What ? Do you remember saying don't believe in ghosts? Nice to meet you, Mr. Oren Father ! well it could have been worse So that's why that we need more time Once it's all done then you can leave them take the mansion You know it's.. pretty crazy But your mother would never have accepted to give up without a fight So, are you in? I am on it One, two, three, all together! Yeah Alright, now what? I have exactly what it takes At University I was the king of Halloween It takes a bit of technique Need help ? We do research Owl Why ? For the Terror Squadron The Terror Squad? What's this ? The bank did not keep their promise and will seize Echoville before we sell Oh no When do they come? Probably tomorrow So, before Friday the 13th That's it Well, do Terror Squad Recruiting? Want to join us? It's out of the question to stay idly by and let them kick you out before selling Welcome to the new member of the terror squad Connie Now you have to meet Ghosting Hello How are you ? Hello Good morning ! We are sent by the bank to enter the property Mr Oren! Come on, come on Mr Oren There is someone ? Mr Oren! It is high time to leave We can do it gently or use force You have to look at yourself in all the mirrors? I want to suck your blood Let me guess You have been frightened by ghosts You are the tenth team who comes back saying that this mansion is haunted But I know that is wrong Approach They want to play smart I will have to go back there Mr Alessi, what can we do for you? What happens to my men who leave here terrified? I do not know They arrive here quietly, but they all run away They all go back to the offices saying that this mansion is haunted Haunted? Echoville? I think they are laughing at you You are welcome, come in and see for yourself It is what I am going to do Do you want us to show you around? No it's not necessary Treat yourself We'll see if it's really haunted Haunted, my.. Anything This mansion is not haunted I told you Prepare your things and be ready to leave tomorrow No more excuses, no more shenanigans Alessi, I'm listening My client starts getting impatient, Mr. Alessi Why don't you still acquired the mansion? Small details, Mr. Lee But it will be in my possession tomorrow at this time You have received a large sum to make things go well we execute when things go wrong And I thank you Give me 24 hours and you and the Golden Dragon Corporation, can start the demolition Golden Dragon? Yuto! What did you say ? I said nothing If, just now, you said Yuto Yuto? I don't see what you're talking about, my poor friend but you have 24 hours and not a second longer! Otherwise, we will have to to recover our generous gratuity with interest The friends ! It's Yoto That's why the bank throws you out So he can destroy the mansion and trap me there forever How do you know that ? He said the name of the company who wants to buy it: Golden Dragon Corporation Dragon! Yuto is a ghost dragon Alright daddy you might be wondering why a ghost speaks to us So don't be afraid, but.. Me ? To fear ? Ghoster and I know each other well You know each other ? Sure I helped him escape at the last full moon but we didn't get far We failed on the first test We didn't tell you because we thought you'd freak out Why this ? Ghoster is one of the last living owners of Echoville Really ? Yes, it belonged to my great-uncle, but they put him in jail because they believed that he had hurt me But it wasn't him, it was Yuto And ever since, I've been trapped here Hold on if your great-uncle is also my mother's great-uncle it makes you.. my uncle ? But they told me my sister was dead with my parents And to Abigail, she was told that it had been sent with her great-grandmother to protect her So I have a family I imagine that when.. Or if you beat the.. What's his name ? Yuto So If you beat him this manor will be yours, as a living heir How's that living heir? I am dead Well, if you release your life force, you could live again Or not I may have said too much I do not think so that it works like that Once the vital forces are released, me and my deceased family will be reunited in the spirit world But if this mansion was mine I promise my family would always be welcome to Echoville Really ? All these years, I thought I was alone in the world but now I have found my family I never want to lose you again I insist that you stay Whether I'm dead or alive It's really very generous Thanks, Ghoster But in fact what is your real first name? William Nice to meet you, William EXCEPTIONAL PROPERTIES So Father Eh ? Yes It's Friday the 13th and we only have one chance to get there Are you ready ? We are ready as ever You, Juan and me, we should stay here to keep the house and prevent those of the bank from approaching Yes OK Let's get Ghoster They'll be fine The long-awaited moment has arrived You have to focus on the goal It's gonna be scary but that shouldn't stop us We must defeat Yuto at all costs tonight You can do it, William You can Ready ? Ready Good then.. what are we doing, Ghoster? full moon light should flood the board Look, it's happening We don't make paintings like that anymore Elizabeth insert the key Let's go Here it is This is the door of the first test Let's go What is this owl? I wonder if the statues have something to do with it The letters on the shields must be part of the solution This one has a K What ? K! This one has an A! This one has an E! And there, a B! Wait, Mateo Did I say something wrong? I think we have to form a word Yes Yes It's a messy word We have the letters: B, K E and A I found: bake We can try B, A, K, E! It was not this One minute Look ! The owl statue Notice what he's missing? The beak, of course Beck, in English It would be better or we will end in shish kebab But of course, kebab! K, A.. It's bad Yeah Too many A's B, E, A, K! well it was easy Kebab? Serious ? What should be done, in your opinion? Looks like these levers control the mirrors We'll see that Be careful Its good I understood The mirrors should reflect light into the room And what are we aiming for? I would say that's it Yes The owl has been useful to us before, why not now ? Good.. What are we waiting for ? Thanks There must be a clue on the order of the levers There, there is something The numbers one, two and six It's no use to us I found something else Looks like numbers too Roman numerals I understood One works A Of them Six I thought you understood I do not know ! It's one, two, six! We got screwed Don't give up, we can do it It's easy for you to say You can fly And then you're already dead It wasn't nice at all Mom, then I need you A What are you doing ? Of them Do you want to kill us? You trust me ? Together Four ! How are you.. When I saw my reflection, I understood The reflection of six is ​​four You are a genius I never would have found Glad you trusted me? It was not this I said to myself that if I should die, I wanted to hold your hand If you're scared and you want hold my hand, ask I am not afraid It wasn't me who was screaming just now Let the party begin ! Let's go ! Here you are I finally found you Connie? You have to go back to help your father quickly What's going on ? The bank sent twelve men He needs help You will finish later I.. It is not so simple It's urgent Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent me Let's go How did you come here? The door was still open, okay? Come, there is not a moment to lose Did you pass all the tests? Not really Let's say Ghoster isn't the only one to travel through mirrors Look, it's Yuto! We've gone too far for you to stop us now The dagger of light You think that with your little dagger do you have the power to attack me? Ijo Ingara Rozora! Nope ! What's going on ? Elizabeth Help me You thought that I was going to leave you win my trials and overcome me? Where did my father go? He's busy with I don't know what But that's the least of your worries What did you do to her? He is simply restrained He is.. I said he was detained What did you do to Ghoster? I put a spell on him His life force leaves him At midnight it won't be nothing What do we do now ? At three, you go left, and I go to the right Alright, but at three, or after three? I count to three and here we go I hear you, you know? Three ! Mateo! I've been dreaming of this moment for 50 years Finally, the line is complete You see I thought that with the souls of your mother and your uncle I had finally found what I needed to complete the transformation But when their cursed uncle sent your mother away I had to exercise restraint and wait for the next full moon as well as your arrival What ? I needed a female member of your family Who do you think sent the inheritance letter? Now that you're here my young heiress as I had planned my rebirth is assured It's not for today, Yuto What is that ? Nope ! No, it can't end like this! Nope ! Take the safe, Elizabeth So Where is Yoto? Sit on it It's up my alley I am so proud of you You were incredibly brave, during all this time Mom I'm still so scared for Ghoster i can save it but i have to say goodbye to you before doing so Impossible to come back afterwards No, I don't want to lose you again I can give it life that he should have had I love you mom Honey, I love you very much I will always be with you Still Good.. what if we go back now? Abigail It's really you ? Promise me to watch over her I will do it I promise There's no time to lose I have to go I've been waiting for this moment for 50 years Hello friends Abigail What are you doing ? One minute Is it.. What's going on ? Midnight two It should already be there Look William Welcome to the world of the living I'm so glad You all Get out, out! Mr Alessi i am the owner and the rightful heir to the manor You entered without permission, so, I invite you to leave You ? It's cute but you're just a kid This property is in the bank now The time to claim it is over I think that should more than cover James's debts, with interest So let's consider that this case is closed We're leaving Now that these inconveniences are settled I think we need to very quickly organize a party She is always there I say I just realized you've never danced before I think so that you are absolutely right Would you do me the honor?
