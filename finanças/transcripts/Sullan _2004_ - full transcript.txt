'MOURYA, NOBODY CAN DEFEAT HIM' I need you to sign here. Keep this inside. Sir.. - Hey! - Please, don't hit me! Did you think we wouldn't find you if you run away? I'll cut you to pieces. I'll repay it, sir.. - Hey! Repay.. - I'll return your money. - Did you think you could get away? We know what would make you return the money. Get in! - Sir.. Is it what you want? I found a groom for my daughter. I don't have enough money. Even a basic wedding and feast is costing me Rs. 50,000. I don't have any other option but to borrow money on interest. You are borrowing money as you are in need. If you don't repay it you won't be able to tolerate their torture. I'll repay it, sir. - You think that's easy. They are not as soft as you think. They are demons. Put your thumb print here. I have never seen anyone repaying the entire amount and walking away with the document. Sir, my husband ran left us alone, you know that too. So, I must take care of her future. I can't bear it if she follows her dad's footsteps. My daughter must live happily. Naidu, do you know her? Yes. - Yes.. - Oh! Hey, give me that money. Quick! Here, take this. One, two, three, four, five, six.. - Hey! What are you counting for? - ...ten, eleven. It is Rs. 12,500. You can take it. Sir, I asked for Rs. 25,000. This is a lot less than that. Hey, give me that money. Give it back now! Oh.. - Hey, how much do you need? - You may give as you wish. Sir, please forgive me. My daughter's wedding depends on this money. I made a mistake. You may charge any interest that you like. Give me the money, sir.. - Hey! Sir! - I heard everything.. I am here. Don't worry. - Look at what he is doing. You want money for your daughter's wedding? Hey! Order a gold nuptial chain and send it to her. Did you understand? Don't be scared. As long as I am here, I'll help you. Don't worry. Bye.. Just pay the interest on time. I will see you, sir. 'What a heartless man!' 'You are throwing gold as a bait to loot her.' Hey! What is this? What is this? - I'll repay you as soon as I can. This month was difficult. Else I would have paid. I'm working. Please leave me, sir. You're working? You think we're scared of the police? I am going to strangle you. Sir! Oh, no! Mr. Soori is coming. Please ask him not to come. I'll find a way to repay you. Sir, please tell him. I'll repay it once I get my salary. Sir.. The garbage is spilling on the road. I'll repay it, sir. - Where is the money.. I'll repay it, sir.. You expect me to spare you because you're a policeman? Sir, I'll find a way to pay you. - When will you do it? Soori, is there any problem? - Greetings, sir. It's nothing.. You carry on.. I'll see you later. - Let's go! Hey, what did I say when I gave you the money? Didn't I tell you to pay the interests on time? What an atrocity! They are thrashing a traffic constable in front of a minister. We are low-grade workers, they won't hesitate to kill us. Make sure you secure the thrash properly, it might fall on them. Oh, God! Sulla.. - Sulla.. Hey, you can't run away! This is a competition. You can't quit in the middle of it, wait until it's over. Don't make me do it, he looks furious. He already told you that for ten hits, he will hit you just once. Face it and leave if you can. - Look, he might bash me up. Hey! You can't say that now. You should've thought about it before accepting the challenge. Did he restrict or resist when you were hitting him? Did he have preferences as to what he wanted to fall into? He kept his mouth shut and took all your beating. Now it's his turn. You must do the same. Hey, come on! "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." One. Two. Three. Four, five. Six, seven. Eight. Head is the strongest among all the parts of the body. Why would I hit elsewhere? Be it anybody, one punch is enough to make them dizzy. Now I am marking my spot. Oh, God! Did Sulla hit you? - Yes. He would have told you, isn't it? Once he hits, all the craziness shoots up right into your head and makes you feel like you are dying. And then? - Nothing much I will massage the damaged area with steamed oil and give you relief. He might look thin but his punches are.. Here, swallow this and apply this over your forehead. He seems to have taken up bashing people as a job. Where is he now? "A rooster is known for its fight." "A lion is known for its ferociousness." "Sulla is known for his punches. Come on, whistle along!" "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "A rooster is known for its fight." "A lion is known for its ferociousness." "Sulla is known for his punches. Come on, whistle along!" "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Don't drive faster on bad roads." "Don't underestimate the banana peel and step on it." "Don't." "Don't." "Don't underestimate my power." "Don't boast about yourself. - Don't." "Don't." "A small matchstick has the power to burn a whole hut." "A small matchstick has the power to burn a whole hut." "I can give you fun like the giant wheel." "I'll surround you like the divine discus of Lord Vishnu." "Sulla is known for his punches. Come on, whistle along!" "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "You will have no peace of mind if you are wealthy." "Though I'm poor, I'm happy." "Don't see the garbage outside in the society." "Look into the clean hearts of the humans." "It feels like heaven if we have people who love us." "It feels like heaven if we have people who love us." "If I bash you, you will get a sprain." "I am the only one who can cure it." "Sulla is known for his punches. Come on, whistle along!" "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "A rooster is known for its fight." "A lion is known for its ferociousness." "Sulla is known for his punches. Come on, whistle along!" "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." "Hey, Sulla! Come on." Hey, you combed you hair all this while. Why did you mess it up? That is a style! Do you think you are very handsome? - Hey, don't say that. If the neighbouring girl hears this, she will tease me. Hey, Sulla. - You! - Have breakfast and go. Hello. What is for breakfast? Here, have this. Can't you prepare an omelette with this? Of course, I can! As if your dad is earning a lot. Why is this stinking? Did you mix poison in my food because you can't tolerate me? I have been wishing for it, but I doubt your mom would do that. There's nothing wrong in it. I can dump your body in my lorry and burn you with all the trash. Here he comes, now I know where the stink is coming from. I should be blaming you. Pamper him, give him food and he is never going to fend for himself. Where is he? Hey, you look so skinny. How dare you threaten people! You take ten hits and hit them back once, isn't it? I'll beat you with slippers till it breaks. - I'll buy you a new one. Hey, someday you are going to end up in a huge mess. Do you think I am some weakling? I'm fast and smart. - Hey, shut your mouth! Oh, God! What kind of a family is this! Ask her how to eat with my mouth shut. Hey, how are even able to eat? - Oh, God! Please let me eat peacefully. Look at the way he is sitting, like one of those beggars. Get up! He is not going to pay heed to my words. What are you looking at? This is such a good omen! Lakshmi.. Come in, why are you still standing there? She is shy. - Come in. I managed to find a groom for her, here is the invitation. Stay blessed, dear. Sundari, you have dressed up well. Is there something special again? - Get out, you idiot! - Oh, my! You have a lovely son! Sir, don't get angry. They are friends, so, he teases her. I wanted to take a picture of her before she leaves for her in-law's. Sundari, you mom sacrificed a lot to bring you up. You mean everything to her. I know the hardships that parents go through to get their daughter married. Dad, I'm leaving. Ma'am, good morning. - Good morning. Kalpana.. Give me Rs. 50. Why? - For your marriage. Don't ask such questions. Actor Rajinikanth's film has released. Please.. I have money left only for the bus pass. I can steal it from dad and give you tomorrow. Thanks to my sister who gave me Rs. 50! "Oh, my God! I have seen the girl." "Looking fine and fit. Let me praise the God." - What is it? "Now let me follow you wherever you go." "Want to look at that damn with so love!" "Now let me get the things all right. Girl!" "Your body is so light and tight." "Got to move it.." "I just want to do it.." - What, mister? Oh! I'm sorry. "Oh, beauty! Your gait is mesmerising!" "Why is this.." Hey, look. An angel is standing at the bus stop. The bus stop itself is starting to look good. Why are you all looking at me? What's your intention? What will you do? Oh, God! Are you all going to rag me? Though we see many girls, it is good to see such a traditional one. It is beautiful to see you walking in this attire. The rose in your hair reminds me of actress Sridevi in the film 'Premabhishekam'. Wow! Do you all like my dress and this rose? My dad bought these. Your dad has a good choice. It is very nice. Thank you very much. Don't look at me like that. I feel very shy. Oh, God! Her sweet words are killing me. Can you please hold this? - Why? Please hold this. Aren't you able to leave this dress and go? - No. Do you really like it that much? - Yes. Let me come through. Rita, can't you give me a seat in your quota? Hello, forget about it for now. Dance like actor Rajinikanth. Here? - Yes. - Yes. Hey, Buddy! - Yes! - Come on. Go on.. "Oh, the beauty from Gajuwaka! We are the bangle sellers." - Yes! "Give me your hand, I will help you with the bangles." "We are the bangle sellers from Gajuwaka.." "Give me your hands.." Oh, God! Buddy, listen to me. Don't trouble her. She created a typhoon in the middle of the road. You can't resist it. It is better if you move from there. - Conductor! Tell him that these seats are for the ladies. Stupid! - He would have heard that. I need not tell it again. Ticket.. Look at him. He looks like one of those good for nothing guys. Buddy, please get up. Get out of there. What are you looking at? 'Senior citizen and handicapped.' - What are you looking at? Hey, mister! These seats are reserved for the ladies. Get up! - "Though everything" "goes upside-down.." 'He doesn't pay heed at all.' "We will never give up." "We will never give up.." - Hello! Oh! Were you talking to me? Sorry.. I thought you were talking to someone else. Is she the one you were talking about? You didn't tell me. Sorry. - When the girls are standing how can you sit in those seats? - Oh, no! You need not be angry about this. You want to sit, right? Yes. - One minute. Murali, please take it. She is not able to stand any longer. Oh, my.. - "Punjabi!" Oh, no! Sorry, sir. I didn't know. That's okay. - Please sit down. - No, you sit down. That's okay, just two more stops before I get off. You may sit down. - Is that so? Okay. "Punjabi!" Oh! He is very smart! Excuse me. If you don't mind, can I sit here? Of course, you may. I'll make space for you. Thank you. - Wow! - He is very lucky! Oh, God! Oh! I'm sorry.. - No, it's okay.. You can sit comfortably. Wow! He is really lucky. Ouch! Be careful.. Okay? - Thank you. He is doing great! I did not do it on purpose. I'm a handicapped so, I thought I can put my hand.. Sorry, it was by mistake. Oh, okay. He is smart, Buddy! We have arrived. You get down first. Wait.. Move aside and give him way. You may come. Hello! Are you surprised that a handicapped did this stunt? You acted smart by creating a scene on the road. I showed you that I'm smarter than you. You look sizzling hot! You idiot! Change the dialogues. This is all old fashioned. Move on. Nowadays, there is no respect for college students. Why is that? - Look, here comes a lean boy. These people are a disgrace to our name. Crap! Hey! Come here. Did you call me? Yes, come here. Oh! What is your name? - Sulla. - What? You wanted to rag me, didn't you? Is this enough? May I go? Who is he? - What's this? Junior ragged the senior when it should be the other way around. Ask him to come here. - Hey! - Yes, sir? Come here! - Of course, I will come. What are you looking at? - Oh, shouldn't I be looking? Here, hold this. Hey, what is he doing? - Hey.. Why are you doing this? Get up and come here.. Enough of swimming. Get up. That person hit me on my head. You might ask me to do this. So.. What's next? Should I run around the college while imitating a train? Watch this. He is over-doing this. - I will teach him a lesson. Hey, run! Hey! Does it look funny? Did you think I will trip and fall? You can only aim at my leg, but I can chop your head off. Don't enrage me. If you do, you will be dead! Hey! Mister. Who are you and where are you going? Greetings, sir. I work in the corporation as.. Are you the commissioner? No, I'm Mani, the driver of the garbage truck. My son is studying here. I am here to meet him. What? Is your son studying here? Should I believe this? Hey, that's enough. Now get out., It's true that my son studies here. Hey, I told you. If that's true, meet him after the college. Go away. - Hey! Shouldn't poor children study in the college? You are just a peon. Don't pretend like you are an officer. You may go, sir. He is a bumbling idiot. Why should we get into these elections? You may ask someone else to participate. Though I refused, they are forcing me to take part. Tell them that it's impossible. Sir, are you searching for the office room? No, my son studies here. But I don't know where he is. So, I'm searching for him. - What is he studying? I don't know. He asked me money for higher studies and I gave. That is all I know. But I don't know what he is studying. He might be studying something really important. What is your son's name? - It's Subramani. student named Subramani.. - No.. It's Sulla.. All his friends call him that. Oh! You are Sulla's father. Please wait here. I'll call him. No.. Please don't. If he finds out that I am here he will not be happy. Just show me where he is. I'll see him from a distance. That's the one. The third room in the front. Sir, did you see him? - Thank you very much. My son is studying. My family will prosper. I'll see you. - Okay. Mister! - Yes? - What is my son studying? My son is studying this. It might be a great line of education. Lakshmi, now I am confident that he would do a better job than me. Attention please!

Hey, first sign these documents. If not, I'll thrash you to your death. Sign it! Come on! Sign it, you idiot! Auction is over! Anarchy.. Our country is filled with anarchy! It has been 50 years since we got our independence. But we don't have the freedom to question others. Those days, we were under the rule of the British. Now we are under the rule of our own people. That's the only difference. Starting the time that the parliament was formed till the auction held yesterday there is corruption, violence and anarchy involved. Isn't there anyone who can question them? Isn't there anyone to stop this injustice? We must stop these illegal activities! We must.. Superb! You did great! Continue.. No one responded to words. The trend has changed, they need the action. Yes! Why are you so enraged? Do you think you can talk anything that comes into your mind? What did you say? 'This must stop.' 'We must stop these illegal activities.' Yes, we must stop these. Wait right there, I'm coming. Hey, get away from here! You are right. We must stop whatever we feel is not right. Hey! He is shouting since morning. Did anyone support him? Everybody is minding their own business. Okay, let's forget them. You and I can sort this out. I'll ask you something. Answer me. You were talking on this mic. Hello, mic testing.. One, two, three.. Hello.. The bass is good! Tell me, on which side to you is this mic? Tell me! - It is on my right. I'll say, it's on my left. Whose answer is right? It's on left for you and on the right for me. What is right for me is wrong to you. What should I do about that? Tell me, what can I do? If a mic can cause such a clash there would be many more problems in the corporation. So, we must stop just like you said. But sometimes we must.. - No. - ...kill people like you. 'Gathering of the Revolutionary Youngsters Association of India' Excuse me? What's the time? It's 9:30. Is it a.m. or p.m.? Idiot! She clearly told me to come at 9:30 p.m. Why are you confusing her? Dear, am I right? Hey! Call an auto rickshaw for us. Find out how much she charges and get her into an auto rickshaw. If not an auto rickshaw, call a taxi, I'm a busy man. Sir, give me one cigarette. This clock is giving me a lot of trouble. Why all this delay? She is waiting, isn't she? What time is it? - Time.. Crap! "Darling.." - It's not working. It's troubling me just like my dad. Sorry, sir. It's not working. - "The secret of her beauty.." I'll bring her. - Okay. - You make all the arrangements. Okay. - What's the time, sir? It is the same time as yesterday. Go.. Go away.. He is a small boy who is scared of us. He shouldn't mess with us. Dear, look here. Tell me how this song is. "Which place are you from? Oh, beauty.." "Which place.." - There he comes again! Greetings, sir. - Greetings.. That's my friend's bike. I didn't want to damage it. - Yes.. So, I just parked it aside and came. When I asked you the time you said it is same as yesterday. But you didn't mention the time. It's a very bad time. - Yes. If I ask you, he is answering and if I ask him, you are answering. Oh, wow! You are playing around. You said it is a bad time but you forgot to mention who it is bad for. I think your time is bad. Not mine, I think it's time to teach you a lesson. Oh, my God! Excuse me, what's the time now? Today is 2nd of February 2006. To be more clear, 15th day of the month of 'Pushya' in the year of 'Parthiva'. I don't know the auspicious time. But I think I started in an inauspicious time. There are no inauspicious moments for today. Everything is going to be all right if we stay in our limits. Now the exact time is 11:20 a.m. Seconds, one, two, three.. - Hey! I forgot. So, forgive me. I might die if you hit me again. She is under the hot sun. Take her away from here. - Hey! You told the exact time. If you had told me this half an hour ago we would have gone our separate ways. Yes. - Why did you mess it up? What am I supposed to do? That's my fate. What is it? - Actually, I'm scared. Can you please drop me near my hostel? Hey, what do you mean? What are you underestimating? Me or my ability? What is the point in fighting all of them when you are still scared? Wait here till your bus arrives and board it to go to your hostel. I am going. Hey! Why are you speeding? You might die! You would die if my vehicle runs over you. Go! No matter how fast I ride, I can control it. Anyway, I'm sorry. Oh, my God! - Quiet! If you try to shout, I will bite your lips. Can you please move a bit? No, I can't. Come with me. - Where? They are here again. Come and fight them. How can you ask me to fight them now? You are in love with me, right? - No, I'm not. Then why did leave me there? - So what? If you didn't have feelings for me you should've let me sit on your motorbike. So, you are in love with me. Not at all, now get off. - Don't lie to me. Don't you like me? Swear to me. - I swear that I don't like you. Don't you like me.. - I don't like you.. Hey, what happened? - Why did you shout? Have you gone mad? Idiot! He is owlishly staring at us. Get him an amulet from the mosque. Yes, I have gone mad. "Turn the computer on." "Four, three, two, one." "I want to rock you so tight. It's going to be a longer night." "You are going to think it so hard." "These beats are going to hit you tight." "Hey, beautiful! Come, let's rock it down." "Hey, handsome! Are you here to kiss me?" "Rain rain, don't go away." "I'm shaking it down with my girl today." "Rain rain, don't go away." "I'm breaking it down with my boy today." "Hey, beautiful! Come, let's rock it down." "Hey, handsome! Are you here to kiss me?" "Rain rain, don't go away." "I'm shaking it down with my girl today." "One, two, three, four! Four, three, two one!" "Feelings grow in my heart when you kiss me." "If you come to me, I will trip out of happiness." "I will drink your beauty." "Let me hold you tight and kiss you." "Don't show off and try to intimidate me." "I will not do it. Face me if you can." "Rain rain, don't go away." "I'm shaking it down with my girl today." "Rain rain, don't go away." "I'm breaking it down with my boy today." "Hey, beautiful! Come, let's rock it down." "Hey, handsome! Are you here to kiss me?" "All the people in the world" "now you are watching, hearing, feeling, grooving." "It's the 'Bhangra', hip-hop remix."

"I'm breaking it down with my boy today." Kavya. Don't get me wrong. Actually I have been wanting to tell you something. I have tried to express it in this letter. I mean, I have written it. If you can read it once.. I'll kill you, idiot! Sulla. What? - What.. How dare you write a letter to her! No.. - There are many girls here. Why didn't you give it to them? - Please, leave me.. I will kill you. Hey, why were you smiling when he was giving it to you? I'll thrash you. Give that here. 'Dear, Kavya. I wanted to write a love letter to you' 'but it won't be as poetic as you.' 'You are not just Kavya. You are the resemblance to love.' Wow! Superb! I'm unable to write anything like this. 'The sky turns into an umbrella if it rains in my dreams.' 'When it really rains, the umbrella turns out to be the sky.' 'You are my dream and you are my love.' Idiot! Sure.. Do you think she will fall for such poetry? Do you think she will accept you for just this letter? Did I ever betray you? I'm struggling to write such a letter to her. You look fair and handsome. Shouldn't a dusky people fall in love? Do me a favour I will tell you how much I love her and how important she is to me. Write it in a paper and give it to me. I will give it to her. If she rejects me.. Will you reject me? If she rejects me, I will give your letter to her. Hey.. Please. I couldn't write a letter like this. That's why I just scribbled in this entire book. Sorry.. I apologise for hitting you. There is nothing wrong in writing a letter to her. It's definitely not wrong. I love her. I couldn't sleep last night. You know she keeps disturbing me. Sorry.. Do you like me? Did you fall in love with me? - Yes. Do you want to live your life with me? Tell me, do you want to live your life with me? - Yes. Since when have you been having these feelings? Since last night. - But I started feeling this way from the moment I saw you. Do you think I'll fall for someone who is fair and handsome? You said you cannot write a letter. Those scribbling speak a lot about your feelings. You..! Buddy, did Kavya respond when you proposed to her? That's none of your business. Hey, Nayar! Welcome, sir.. - Hold on to it, I'll come back. Hey, get me two glasses of water. - Okay. Would you like some tea? Just get me some water. People usually mix liquor with water. But I mix water with liquor. That is my style. Buddy, let's go from here. - Why? Look over there. I don't think it's the right time. He might mess with me and I would end up in a fight again and my dad will beat me up. Let's go. Nayar, give me two cups.. I will go to some other shop. Sir, this is my business time. There are chairs inside. Can you please go inside and drink? Why shouldn't I drink here? It's just one peg. Hey, why the hell did you touch me? No, I'm just trying to go out. - So what? Am I not standing here? Come here. I'm getting late for collage. Let me go. What will you do there? - Let me go, sir. Stretch your hand. - Sir, please.. - Put your hand out! Sir, please don't do it. I have to go. Where do you want to go? Sir, take it off. - Hey, that's okay. Take it off! - There is some change in your tone. What is it? Take it off. - Oh, look! He is angry. - Take it off! What if I don't? - Hey! You, scoundrel! Hey! Stop it! I will kill you! - Hey.. Calm down! I was minding my own business. Idiot! I will slay you alive. Hey, calm down. - I didn't do anything. - Okay.. Let it be. - Hey, how dare you.. - I said stop it. I'm sparing you just because of him! If not.. People should be terrified to even talk to my goons. Hey, are you trying to flirt with him? He won't fall for anyone. Right! Is he your master? - Hey, what are you saying? There is only one sun, one moon and only one Rajini. As if! Why do you always wear a sari? Why don't you dress up in a modern dress? Forget that. Your friends are here for you. Oh, my God! Hey, come here. - What? - I said, come here. What? Do you consider yourself a hero? Why are you showing off? Let me go. What did you do in Nayar's shop yesterday? - I just drank some tea. Don't be arrogant! - Who told you? Why do you care if someone drinks? Look, you are skinny. Someday, someone will break your bones. Ask who got knocked out yesterday. I know you knocked him down. But do you know what happened to Nayar? They sent him to Kerala. Why do you always make a mess of your life? Sneha, ask him to keep quiet. What's wrong? - First, answer me. - I have been asking you but you never answer. - They have nothing better to do. Never will he have more than this in his pocket. I don't know when is he going to be responsible. Hey, we are late to the movie. Come on! - Wait, I'm coming. Hey! Hey! - Greetings, sir. Why do you want to be run over by my car? Sorry, sir. You please go. Go.. - You may go. - He always cuts into my way. Go. Take it and move. Why did you catch a running bus? - To meet you. Who is going to buy the ticket if you keep staring at her? Take it. Get down. - Why? - I don't have change. Get down. You will have it in your bag. Give that. Hey, what am I supposed to do if I give you all the change? First, give it to me. Take care of them later. - Hey, get down. I feel that today is your unlucky day. God! He is irritating me. Driver, go to the police station. - Let him go. Is there any strict officer there? What did you just say? - Hello. Get me a ticket to the campus. - But you already have it. That's none of your business. Give me the ticket and ask him to start the bus. - This happens every day. Why did you buy it for me? We shouldn't spare them. It was just going to be inconvenient for everyone here. So, forget it. - God! Why are you so peace loving? Ma'am, at least you be brave. Hey, will you come? - Yes! - Shut up! I asked if you would walk me to my hostel. Why? Don't you have money to buy a ticket? No. - I can buy a ticket. Otherwise, we can go without buying one. I mean, I want to speak to you while walking. Come on! Do you watch award winning movies all the time? - Why? Because only they show lovers walking without speaking to each other. That's why. Hey, say something. Hold this. Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen and activists. Vote for our party and make it win! You asked me to speak. This is how we speak. I asked you to speak only to me, not to the entire world. Hey, catch me if you can.. - Stop there. You cannot catch me.. - I caught you. The hostel life makes me miss home. My mom who always scolds me. My dad who is an easy going man. My brothers who love me. My sisters-in-law who always smile and their cute kids. Our home is always filled with their smiles. When I left home to join this college I used to feel really lonely. But I saw that affection in someone here. Who is that? - That's you. Come closer. You shouldn't get drenched in the rain. Come closer.. 'Come, let's get drenched. - I won't.' 'Why? Don't you like it?' 'We might get cold if we get drenched.' 'How boring! I want you to come here.' 'Hey, go. She is calling you.' 'If you don't, I will leave. - I won't come. Go away!' 'I will seriously walk away from here. - Go!' I feel great when I'm getting drenched with you. "You are the poet and I'm the poetry." "But the fact is really unknown." "I could feel, hear your feelings and your poetry in my dreams." "You are the poet and I'm the poetry." "But the fact is really unknown." "I could feel, hear your feelings and your poetry in my dreams." "My heart literally demands you." "My heart is asking me to marry you." "You are the poet and I'm the poetry." "But the fact is really unknown." "I could feel, hear your feelings and your poetry in my dreams." "Rise from the darkness to enjoy the light." "Reach me with happiness." "Always protect me from the wicked eyes." "Show me the light that can guide me to you." "Your smile drizzles on me like the shower of gentle rain." "When I take in your breath, my heart rejoices." "I could feel, hear your feelings and your poetry in my dreams." "The whole world should dance gaily when you look at them." "I can get all the men fall for me with just a touch." "You are so naughty. You can teach people to be like you." "In that case, I will gift my naughtiness as a dowry to you." "These moments of our love will stay eternal." "This love has agreed to get us closer." "You are the poetry and I'm the poet." "But the fact is really unknown." "I could feel, hear your feelings and your poetry in my dreams." "My heart literally demands you." "My heart is asking me to marry you." Idiot! Damn it! I'm late. The bus didn't arrive yet. Hey, the bus has arrived. Sir, could you move a little? Sir, make some way. Take this. Take this ticket. Give me the money. Do not stand there. Come inside. Come on in.. Sorry. - These guys started it again. Go. Get inside. Damn it! - Can you please get me two tickets for Rs. 4? Damn it! I think these guys don't have anything better to do. What are you staring at? Don't stand there. Get inside.. Dear, come and stand here. They come here only to misbehave. Damn it! Sir, can you please move a bit? - Why? - Please, move a little. Come here. Come and face me. Turn around! This is what you've been struggling for, right? I have been noticing you. You always want to stand close to me. You are doing a good job. - Do you want to marry me? Let's get down at the next stop. Will you marry me at the temple? Tell me. Speak out! I swear, I'm not joking. Seriously, will you? When you could like a girl like me I don't want a handsome guy. I can settle with you. I don't expect anything else. I just need food thrice a day and two saris per year. That's it. Will you marry me? I don't even have to tell my parents. I will come with you right now. Do you have the courage to marry me? - No.. I.. You can't, right.. You just want to have fun with me, right? Then why do you misbehave? We cannot afford to buy our own vehicle just because you do this to us. We are forced to travel by the bus. Because we really can't afford it. We just want to support our parents financially. That's why we work. - Poor girl. Look at this. Our dreams and our hopes are worn out just like this bus pass. Please don't trouble us anymore. You should have thrashed him with the slippers. They will not change even if you do that. Parvathi, why are you running? - They are here! - Who? Those men who had lent me money. I couldn't pay this month's interest. I'm really scared. They will use abusive words. I have led a respectful life, I can't go through this. Don't worry. - What's are you scared now? Shut up! She is scared. Give that to me. What is scaring you? Drink water, I will talk to them. - Go.. You can only abuse me you would know better once you talk to them. Don't be so loud. Wait! Where are you going? - I don't have to tell you. Why are you being so rude? I just asked you a question. Hey, just go. - You are here for Parvathi, right? She will pay the interest soon. You can leave now. Really? And then? - She lost her husband. She is helpless.. So what? Do you think I'm here to sleep with her? Move. - Please wait! I said, move! - Listen to me. I said, move! - Hey, wait! - Hey! How dare you dictate me! Hey! Hey! Hey! Who did you think you manhandled? I will kill you! What are you staring at? I will slash you. Didn't she ask you to leave? - Hey! What's your problem? I will destroy you. Hey, how dare you hold my collar! Today, I am tearing this shirt. Tomorrow, I'll rip you apart. I'll not spare you today.. - Don't hit me, Dad.. Why do you get angry? Why is that? Oh, no! Don't hit him. - Actually, I must hit you. Mother and son went around preaching to those people. Do you know who he faced today? - I don't care. He hit my mother. - Don't utter a word. Dad, leave him.. I'll break your hands. - What's all this? For what mistake are you hitting him? If you feel so bad when I hit him, what would happen if they kill him? Yes, that's what I am scared of. He is my only son. I thought he would study well and prosper but he is fighting against all the rowdies. Why did I nurture you both by struggling so much? Sulla, is it to see you die at a young age? Look at him.. He is standing like an idol. Can't he say something? Can't you apologise and promise not to do it again? When I haven't done any mistake, why should I apologise? Don't argue with me.. - Dad, leave him.. Hey, get in! I told you to get inside. It's all my fate! I don't know what bad deeds I did. He is turning into a rowdy. Your support will spoil him. One day, you'll see me dead. Then you will be orphaned. - So be it. Hey.. I am cringing with shame.. He is such a little boy. How dare he mess with me! How dare he mess with me! Hey, he held my shirt. I'll go to his house right now and break his hands and legs. Hey, start the car! - Soori, listen to me. Where are you going? You must not deal with him for your dignity. You might disgrace yourself. Don't! - Sir, calm down. I'll take care of this. I'll chop him into pieces and feed him to the birds. It's a simple matter. You need not worry. Hey, let's go! 'How dare he mess with me!' Hey! Hey! - Hey! Stop! - Hey! - Stop! - Hey.. - Stop.. Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Hey! - Hey! Hey! - Hey! Hey.. - Hey.. - Hey.. - Hey.. Hey, who are you? Subramani. - I don't care. Why are you sitting here? I am playing hide and seek. - What? With whom? - With them. All the Sumos are coming.. Park them in a circle.. Hello, who are you, sir? You are giving me respect after looking at them. Wait and watch the fight. Do you know that if I hit them in my area, Mani will hit me? Who is Mani? - My father. He will bash me up. Sir! Hey! You do fear us. Should we spare you if you run? I ran and came here, but it was not to hide. I brought you here to break your bones. Can you break my bones? You better get into the car. If not.. - Hey! Are you mocking me? - Catch him. - Oh! Catch me if you can. Hey, I may look like a little boy. If you touch me, you will be left broken. What did you say? I didn't say anything. Watch me now. Hey, we asked you to stop the vehicle. Who is Sulla? Can't you all hear me? Who is Sulla? Hey, are you Sulla? Get down. Hey, I told you to get down. What are you looking at? The whole department is afraid of me. Get down. Get down and come here. - Where? To the police station? - Why? We got a complaint that you raped a girl. Me? Who is that girl? - Get down, ma'am. He is the one. - You heard it, now get down. Hey, move aside. Wait, buddy. - Wait. What is it? - Sir, I'm not able to sleep eat or study because of him. I'm not able to do anything. Did you hear that? Now get into the jeep. Did you stop our bus for this silly thing? If she is mad, take her to the hospital. Why are asking me to come? - You can ask them if I am lying. Oh! That's the matter. - Yes, he is the one.. Sir, he looks innocent, but he is very dangerous. Hey, I think this isn't a good time for you. Hey, how dare you threaten them! Get into the jeep. How dare you touch me! - Ouch! Oh, God! Ma'am, why didn't you tell me that he hits the police as well? I was about to act in actor Chiranjeevi's film. You got me here and he hit me.. - Are you are a duplicate police? You are dead. Hey, stop there. - Save me.. I was hurt enough with just one blow. - Idiot, stop there. I cannot take another blow! - I'll kill you. Hey, stop there. - I'm begging you, leave me. Hey! - Hey! This is why I like you. Subramani, your anger is what I like the most in you. "Oh, my love!" "You are like the freshly fallen snow with a lovely heart." "Oh, Sulla!" "You are my moon, sun and rainbow." "I was happy with my newly found strength" "but your love made me a mad person." "When my lips can feel yours.." "Your image gets etched on my heart." "Oh, my love!" "You are like the freshly fallen snow with a lovely heart." "Oh, Sulla!" "You are my moon, sun and rainbow." "At 12. - You know what friendship is." "At 16. - You know what love is." "This beauty nourished!" "The beauty of.. - First light." "The friendship.. - That makes us happy." "It's the age of grace!" "When I decide to win you" "my age should be of help." "In every moment of yours" "I shall infuse my love." "Accept my love towards you like a honey bee." "Oh, my love!" "You are like the freshly fallen snow with a lovely heart." "You waist.. - Is very beautiful." "Like a book.. - Completely." "It explains about love." "If that cloud.. - Becomes an umbrella." "The rain.. - From it.." "...invited me to play in it." "The words in which I expressed my love, filled a book." "I dedicate it to you, my love." "The closeness of us made me glad" "and it makes me tremble in happiness." "Your desires reached me as the blush on your cheeks." "Oh, my love!" "You are like the freshly fallen snow with a lovely heart." "Oh, Sulla!" "You are my moon, sun and rainbow." Is this Kalpana's house? Who are you? What do you want? Is no one else at home? - Why? Can't you talk to me? Who is Kalpana here? Are you a friend of my sister? - Hey. He is here. Who are you? - My name is Satyanarayana Murthy. She's my wife. - Greetings. He's my son Satya. - Greetings. - Greetings. She is my daughter. We are here to ask your daughter's hand in marriage for our son. Shall we discuss this inside? - Come in. You came here unexpectedly. Take your seat. Sit down. - I'll be back. - Okay, sir. Is this a love affair? - Hey! Tell me if there is something like that, dear. That's fine. - Dad, there is nothing like that. I don't even know that person. First, go and find out their details. Why are you asking me without knowing who they are? That's not it, dear. - What do you mean? Go and ask who they are. It's nothing, sir. The thing is.. Sir, do not take this the wrong way. I'll come to the point. I work at government press. I earn Rs. 4,500 a month. I like your daughter a lot. But she doesn't know who I am. One day, she made a person who's misbehaving in a bus realise his mistake instead of humiliating him. I liked that quality in her a lot. I wanted a mature girl like her as my wife. That's why, I convinced my parents and brought them to talk to you. Move in! Do you have a bike? Bike? - Don't you have a bike? Great match! - He's a little apathetic. I'm very glad after hearing your opinion about my daughter. Dad, come here for a moment. She's calling me. I'll be back. What is it, dear? You heard him, right? What should I say? - What now? Should I go with them? What are you saying, dear? Stop it, Mom. - That's not it, dear. How can you accept immediately when someone comes with a proposal? Why are you talking like that, dear? Dad, will you send them away or shall I do it? Do not take this the wrong way. I'll inform you once we discuss about this match more in detail. It's not right on my part to barge into your house like this. Please, forgive us. Bye. Bye, sir. - Come on, Mom. - Good. It's very peaceful here, right? No matter how many times I see it it feels new every time. This limitless sea amazing air stirring sea waves and the noise of these waves. They are all saying something, right? Look over there. Those rays of sun at a distance we can see. They are very beautiful. At the point where the sky and sea meet there will be another small world. In that world we both.. Hey! - Oh, no! Oh, no! Let me go. Did you go crazy on your way here? Hey, your name is Kavya, right? Your dad deserves the blame for naming you that. You are torturing me in the name of poems and songs. If you keep talking about sun rays, sea waves and worlds you'll end up in an asylum. You are thinking too much about unnecessary stuff. But I'm 100 percent indigenous and the hero of Andhra Pradesh. What is it? Don't you like them? No.. It's not because I don't like them. I don't understand such things. All I know is sports, quarrels and fights. That's all. Even now, I'll beat anyone if you want me to. Will you beat anyone? - Yes. Try hitting me. Hey! Sorry.. I-I slapped you by mistake. I'm always like this. I do anything if someone I like asks me to. I'm sorry. Sir? - Yes, tell me. I am here to meet Mr. Satya, he works in the printing section. Just a moment.. Sir, there's a lady here to meet Mr. Satya. 'Restricted Area' Hello? Do you want some tea? You drink tea, right? - Yes. Come on. Vijay! - Sir? - Give me two cups of tea. - Okay. You can wait there, I'll come. Mr. Satya, I need to talk to you. I know. I don't think you came all this way to play hide and seek. Drink your tea. Look, I like you a lot. Oh, no! I acted aloof thinking you are here to apologise. Forgive me. - But I cannot marry you right now. Do you watch a lot of television series? Because you talk like one of those actors. It's not that. I'm being serious. Why are you serious? You can say that with a smiling face. Because if you tell me that you'll not come into my life with a smile it wouldn't be so painful as I will remember your smile. A girl can be happy only if she gets a good husband like you. But my family's happiness is more important to me than that. It's my father's hard work that brings food to the table and a little bit of my effort. My father struggled a lot to raise me and my brother. But my brother has remained to be useless. The hopes of our family are pinned on him. But I don't believe in him. He really is a great guy. But education didn't interest him. Our father will retire in a year. If he spends all his saving on my wedding and I leave them and come with you carelessly my family will not survive let alone have good life. I cannot do this. I can't leave them like that and come with you. If I leave them on their own I'll be the most selfish woman in this world. Do not look at me like that, Mr. Satya. I don't want to be happy alone. Because my father didn't raise me that way. P-Please forgive me. At first, I just thought you are a good person but I now I know that you are a great person. Bye. Hello, one moment! What if your brother changes and takes up the responsibility of your family? I'll see you then. What is this? You left this place saying you would destroy him, right? But you came back running for your lives. What is it, pal? When you went to destroy him, did he beat the crap out of you? N-No, boss. What do you mean, you idiots! I can see it. You all came back like losers. Damn! That's not it, boss. Though he looks like a kid he beat up each one of us. - Hey! Who are you talking to? If I snap a finger, even the sun will rise in the west. That kid is nothing. Hey, start the vehicles. Sir, give three cups of tea. Subramani.. - Are these buns fresh? Hey, Sulla. Come here. - Are you calling me? - Yes. I thought it was someone else. Why are you ignoring me? Do you like me? - Why? It's nothing. Only my dad calls me Subramani. You are the second person to call me by that name. That's why. - I don't know why you don't have a brother like me and I don't have a brother like you. That's why. Fine, let it go. Hey, ma'am. Are you having fun with him? - No, I'll go to some other shop. Yes, right.. Everyone in our college knows about you. Hey, stop it. Wow, you are blushing! Take good care of him, ma'am. If you let him go, you'll regret it. Accept him. Hey.. Throw it. - Hey, come on. Hey, pass it.. - Come.. Hey, this way.. - Hey, cover him. Hey, pass it. - Hey, Raju, come on. - Give it to me. Throw it here. - Pass it. - Fast.. Hey! - Hey! Hey, where is Sulla.. Tell me! Hey, where is he? I don't know, sir. - Why don't you speak up? Will you tell me or not? - He didn't show up yet, sir. Where is Sulla? - Sit down. Wait! They are here to start a commotion. I'll take care of them. Hey, listen to me. - Look, you don't know about them. I'll take care of them. Listen to me. Do not let him out until they leave the college premises. Let me go. Go. Go! Move! Hey, where is he? Where is Sulla? - I don't know, sir.. Tell me. - I don't know, sir. - Sir, we don't know. Doesn't anybody know? Tell me. Hey, where is he? - Sir? - Where is he? I don't know, sir. - Where is he? Hey! - Hey! Leave the college immediately. - Hey, where is Sulla? Listen to me, you don't know about Sulla. Hey. - Hey! - Hey! Get out! - Hey. - Hey. Get out.. - Don't.. Get out of here. - Don't.. Do not interfere! - Leave! Hey.. Hey, get lost. Don't do this. Listen to me. - Get the hell out of here. Do not interfere. - Hey, go! Listen to me.. You saw that, right? No matter who it is, if you interfere this will be the result. Listen to me. Tell him this is what's going to happen to him very soon. Hey, come on. Let me go.. - Listen to us. Don't go. Hey, no one should move an inch from here. Soori must come here and I should kill him. We should be here until then. Right here! We must stay here.. Hey, what is this? Why are you creating a ruckus with a dead body on the road? Who are you? - Hey! - Hey! Dead body? Is he a dead body to you? Don't interfere! Go! Listen to me. Go! Go! No one will go back alive if he tries to interfere. Tell that scoundrel Soori, to come here. He must come here. We need to personally sort our issues. Go! Get lost! Come on, get going. Soori! Hey! Who.. Me? Should I go and bow down to him? I will.. Don't do this. Try to understand why I am telling you this. Hey, the whole city listens to me. Should I listen to you now? Do not talk without understanding me. Hey, I locked up many men by myself. Are you going to lock me up now? Look, you should come and leave as if that's your job. I'm not an idiot to do everything you ask me to. Who the hell is he? He doesn't even have the muscle to lift a rock why should I go there when such guy asks me to? Hey! Why are you being adamant when I'm requesting? You are being impossible because I took money for personal expenses from you. Do as I say. You do not know about police mentality. He's creating problems in Gajuwaka as we speak. He is standing in the middle of the road with the dead body. We have to lose our jobs if people like you start killing people and refuse to cooperate with us. The traffic is jammed in the whole city. If I do not take you down there not just the minister, even God cannot save you after that. Yes.. Let's see what's going to happen. Hey, what the hell can you do? What can you do? Thousands of students will come and tear you apart. I'm telling this for your own good. Just come there and stay in the jail for a month. I'll arrange all the facilities for you there. I'll help you get released after that. Come on. Hey! - Come.. Come on.. - Soori, do not get mad. Come on.. I'm here. - Soori, stop. - Come on. - Hey, stop him. Hey.. - Hey! Hey.. Hey! Is Soori a great man? I'm going to butcher you, I don't care who you are. It's me, Sulla. Hey! - Hey.. Hey, mister. Any criminal who's arrested by the police will be taken to the jail. But since this is a problem with the students we brought him here. We've arrested him like you wanted, right? Now, leave this place. That's good for you and everyone. Come on. Listen to me. Come on. Come on. Sit inside. Sir, where will you go at this time? Somewhere far away, dear. We have struggled all these days to raise this guy. Now we are leaving our house to save him. Can't be helped. We have to bear it no matter how far or tiresome it is. Give that box. Dad.. - That's enough. Do not say a word. You stood on the road for someone's death. If something were to happen to you I cannot do the same for you. That's not it, Dad. Bharat was.. I had many hopes on you. That's the mistake I made. A very big mistake. I thought you would help this family once you graduate. But you are guarding a dead body. They'll destroy our family if we stay here anymore. Hey, Sulla. It's fine if you are not helpful to this family. We just want you to be alive. Come with us. Get in the lorry. Listen to me. Listen to me. Get in the lorry. Fast! Hey! "That's it, my boy!" "You are the best." "He's dancing and it is awesome." "Hey, look at the beautiful girl coming" "with her grace and charm to teach you a lesson." "Look at her big eyes shooting bows of love!" "Look at her big eyes shooting bows of love!" "That's how I am, you naughty boy. I am in the prime of my life." "That's how I am, you naughty boy. I am in the prime of my life." "My tenacity brought fourth my strength and allure." "This desire of mine is very dangerous." "This desire of mine is very dangerous." "I go crazy the more I think of you." "I go crazy the more I think of you." "I go crazy the more I think of you." "Learn to play with flowers and swings." "Do not hesitate to waste time as I'm ready for anything." "Shall I teach you how to play?" "Shall I make the arrangements for you to play?" "Shall I kiss you on your cheek?" "Shall I offer myself to you?" "Hey, come to me, my love! The amazing girl I love." "If you do not do it, I shall do it for you." "Look at her big eyes shoot bows of love!" "Look at her big eyes shoot bows of love!" "That's how I am, you naughty boy. I am in the prime of my life." "My tenacity brought fourth my strength and allure." "This desire of mine is very dangerous." "This desire of mine is very dangerous." "I cooked a meal for you that will make you happy." "I brought you something that will make you happy." "Hey, my love. Eat up quick." "I cannot be happy unless you are satisfied." "You are like a beautifully sculpted statue." "You are the one who grants my wishes." "Hey, get lost, you idiot." "You wouldn't listen to your well-wishers." "My beautiful lady, I'm blown away by your beauty." "This desire of mine is very dangerous." "This desire of mine is very dangerous." "That's it, my boy!" "You are the best." "He's dancing and it is awesome." "Hey, look at the beautiful girl coming." "With her grace and charm to teach you a lesson." "This desire of mine is very dangerous." "Look at her big eyes shooting bows of love!" Hey, didn't you open this book at least once? Excuse me. Why did you come here? The milkmaid told me that you moved from that house. So, to see.. Do you like him? Yes. Our family is an insignificant one. It's very hard to include one more person in it. If you care about his well-being please forget about him. It's good for him and for you too. You are educated. I hope you will understand me. Sister. Take this, Sister. I lied to you for this, Sister. Believe me. I'll study, Sister. I'll protect this family from now on, Sister. Please believe me, Sister. Hey, it's time for you to start your work. 'Smoking and alcohol consumption is injurious to health.' Where is Sulla? Do you think we can't find out if you move to another place? Where is Sulla? Where is that idiot! - What the hell did you say? Hey! Don't you know? - I know. Then tell me. - I won't. Hey, tell me. - I won't. Won't you? - Sulla! Dad. Dad. Where are you, Dad? I'll study, Dad. I won't fight with anyone, Dad. I'll listen to you, Dad. Dad, where are you? Dad! Get lost.. There is no one to stop you now. For us, he worked in this garbage and died here. Get lost! Look Here! Mom too will not live long because of this pain. Why would I be alive after that? You can perform all our last rites at once. Get lost. Go! "I became angry." "I became the bad guy." "I made the heaven my weapon." "I'm here to tear this earth apart." "Time will become my wrath and destroy you." "The evil will no more prosper and push people into despair." "This last ride of my father ruled capital punishment." "I took the responsibility to destroy evil this moment." "The anger which will burn the evil came out of me as tears." "The weight of my heart is drowning me in hatred." "As you infuse the strength in you" "as you destroy the evil" "as you filter this earth again and again" "justice is be once again resurrected." "With the power of all the Gods under the cosmos" "I'll destroy the evil in its very roots." Hey! Pay for that. Hey, what's with that look? 'BAR' - Hey, get lost. Hey! - Come on. Hey, come on. What is this? Hey, let me go. - Take him away.. - I'll kill you all. Hey, let me go. Hey, let me go. Hey, Sulla.. Go in. Do you think you are a rowdy.. What is your name? - Sulla. Sulla! Stupid! Go there. Go and sit there. Sit down. Sit down. Bring me the ledger. How long is his remand? - 15 days sir. What's with that look? Hey, what is your name? I am asking you. - Sulla. How old are you? - 18. What is your father's name? Mani. - Take him to his cell. Hey, keep walking. Go on. Hey, what are you looking at? Go in. Hey, get in. Soori, Sulla is in this jail. He came in today, right? I'll kill him in two days. I'll kill him here. Rajesh? - Present, sir. Ratagoppi? - Present, sir. Saravanam? - Present, sir. Rangasammy? - Present, sir. Murugaru? - Present, sir. Blade baskar? - Present, sir. Agurugoppi? - Present, sir. Ramasammy? - Present, sir. Kittu? - Present, sir. Babu? - Present, sir. Munuswamy? - Present, sir. Kali? - Present, sir. Manaian? - Present, sir. Amir? - Present, sir. Raja? - Present, sir. Ravi? - Present, sir. Kittu? - Present, sir. Babu? - Present, sir. Shyam? - Present, sir. Yelumalay? - Present, sir. Kumar? - Present, sir. Somu? - Present, sir. Soori? - Present, sir. - Hey! Idiot! Catch them. Others come to the prison after they commit a crime. But I came here only to kill you. I'll kill you no matter how many police try to get in my way. Yes, as if that's going to happen. I'll break all your bones and bury you in this jail. Or else, I'll stop considering myself a man. Hey, stop this fight. Do it right now. Why did you come, Sister? Didn't you go to work? Why are you all looking at me like that? Yes.. This court looks daunting. Red coloured building and lawyers in black coats. Everyone seems to be moody, Sister. There is an old man sitting inside like our principal in college. He's a very good person. Everyone but him is speaking, Sister. They are not letting him speak. Sister, did I kill someone? I didn't do it. But everyone says I did, Sister. I don't know anything. Sister, shouldn't I perform dad's final rites? Why did he light father's pyre? I was angry and so I hit him and he died. What can I do about that? These people will let me go and I'll come back home. But dad won't come back, right? That's why.. I beat him.. and de died. What can I do about that? Hey, if he comes at you with a knife will you be scared? - Why would I be scared? I'm not afraid. - That's right! Why would you be afraid? Our whole family is brave. Even the God we worship carries a weapon. That's what influenced you. Why does God Shiva carry a trident God Vishnu bear a discus and Lord Human carry a mace? They are to punish anyone who commits a crime. Hey, if it's a murder when Lord Narasimha killed Hiranyakashapa then what you did now is also a murder. Hey, if it's a murder when Lord Krishna killed Narakasura then what you did now is also a murder. Hey, if it's a murder when Lord Rama killed Ravana then what you did now is also a murder. Sir, is he a murderer? They eradicated the evil. Same way, what you did is also eradication of evil. I appreciate you. Mom, come on. He'll come back. You'll be back soon. "It's not a great thing to die for good." "There is nothing wrong in killing to punish the evil."
