THE GREAT BAZAAR Fritters at 500 and 1000. Come on and buy fritters Girl, come and buy some fritters. Come and get them. Our friendly local cop wants fritters too. Great stuff, don't you think? My mother made them. At five hundred and a thousand for fritters. Don't take this one. Take that one there. There are sweeter ones. Which one do you want? So go. Five hundred and a thousand, fritters. They aren't like madam Abuba's fritters, no! Hello, Paito - Hello, Aunt Cecilia. Mom, I've sold everything! The flour ran out. You have to go buy flour to make fritters. Next. - Three kilos of flour. The flour has run out. Come back an hour from now. But the flour has just arrived! Mark your place in the queue. No! I only sell in my smoke shop. Make a queue at the smoke shop. The "When We Have Some" Smoke Shop Give me some cigarettes. I'd like a pack. Cigarettes. Cigarettes and a light to light them. Do you want me to light it? Cigarettes with alight... Wait! Wait! Who stole my smokes? You stole my cigarettes. Paito. Are you taking the train? Where are you going? Tickets. I'll throw you off the train. They were two thieves, One short one with a big head and a bandanna, and a tall one with scars on his face. Are you unloading drinks? - It's for the wedding of the boss daughter. I'd like to buy just one bottle. - No! There's none for sale. Go and buy somewhere else. I only want one beer. - We have none. Isn't this here a bar? I can't go home. They stole the flour money from me, I have to go to the market to work and get some money, to be able to return home. So I can't go back. I'm selling an umbrella with very few holes in it. A pot lid without the pot. A pressure cooker without a lid. An umbrella with very few holes. What is it Paito? The ninjas! - Where are they? There they are. Shove off or I'll hit you. This shoe is 35. Cheap. And its friend? - Its friend... This one here! You can try them on. They aren't the same. One shoe has to be different from the other. Look here. No way I'll get another like this. If you buy shoes that are the same, when one gets worn out you're not going to get another one the same. This way it's easy, you can go and buy another different one and put it on. This one goes well. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Are you following me? I'm just walking. The market doesn't belong to you. You're trying to provoke me. I learned to take good photos in Germany. You're pretty. "Hole in the Fingernail" Photo Studio Hold that pose! Keep smiling. That's it. Here we go. Take my photo. - Do you have money to pay? You almost made me fall with my sack! Leave it be I'll deal with him. He got what was coming to him. That's enough. You hit me! I didn't hit you Xano, I just pretended to. You're an ingrate. An ingrate? With the blows that you landed! Paito. - Yes Auntie? It's almost time. We'll miss the train. We'll be right back. Are you hungry? Let's eat. We won't let a child go hungry. Is the food good? It's very good. This pair works! It goes together well! Are you like Xano who doesn't have a house? Who said I don't have a house? You did. I have a house, but I don't like to go there. My aunts beat me. When a boyfriend shows up, they beat me till I leave. I don't like living with them, I prefer to live here. I'm only here because I got robbed. If it weren't for the flour money, I could return home. My home is right here. I lost the house I had because of the war. I came here fleeing from the war and my first business was to sell my shoes. I didn't have anyone here. I already had a house. I already had a wife and kids as well. But when the war came, it took away everything. While I was cutting firewood in the bush, to make charcoal, my life went up in smoke too. When I came back I didn't find... a single duck or hen, nor my wife, nor my two children, the little ones. I was left with nothing. All I had left was this axe. Here I carved two hearts. My wife's name, Maria, and the names of my children. No defecating or urinating on this wall Grandma, do you want me to bring you some bottle tops to sell? Yes please. Where are you going, running like that? Thief! - Me, a thief?! Show us the basket. So I'm a thief? With an empty basket! How was the wedding? - The wedding?! Were you invited? No. I'm just asking. - What for? Just to know. Why? - Because I want to ask for a small favour. What do you want? - Those bottle tops over there. You can come and take them. Xano, I've arranged some business. I've got a bit of bread. This market is for poor people. You won't get anywhere here. It will take a long time to get your money. I know the city well. Let's go down to the centre of town. Auntie. Can I help you with your load? - No, thanks. Uncle, can I help you carry that? Auntie, some help to carry that? - It's not necessary. Do you want some help to carry that? "No, thank you." Auntie, can I carry that? - Yes, you can. This one isn't from here. What?! I'm not from here?! - Give me the basket. Dad, some help to carry that? Money? Where were you all this time? You only come here to ask for money, to both er us? I'm only asking for one hair's worth! Do you think that earning money is easy? Where were you? You wander around unwashed in the markets and now you come to bring us shame? I'm going to give you a hiding. Just look at our nephew. Completely filthy, dirty! He's come to bring shame on us. Xano, so you came to visit, you bandit? We ought to get this kid arrested. Don't show up here any more. We're going to get you arrested. Auntie, let me help you carry your bag. - OK. How much do the carrots cost? - Twenty-five. Let's see over there. The carrots, how much do they cost here? Thirty a kilo. Let's see here. How mu ch do your carrots cost please? - Thirty. OK. - Auntie. Not these ones. Those over there are nicer. Do you think? Let's go. How much does the garlic cost? - Eighty a kilo. It sure is expensive! I'm going to buy it. Hi, unc. How's it going? What's this? Uncle, I need a bit of money. - No nephew of mine is a street hustler. Uncle, just a few pennies. Let me see if I have some. You can have this one. - This one too. Goon, goon. I don't know this guy. I must have seen him once or twice, whatever... Garlic?! - Yes. Take two. Two?! How much do the candies cost? - How much do you have? Fifteen. I don't want to see you here any more. Did you hear me? Get out of my sight. Two ice creams. This ice cream is good, isn't it? I bought it with my money. Your money doesn't interest me. What I want is to buy flour and go home. You just talk about flour and going back home. I live on the street, I don't go to school, but I can buy ice cream. Today, there in the central market, they were going to give me a thrashing. You they beat, but not me - I'll let them have it. You're lying. You'll see. Take it. I want a candy. How mum is it? One thousand each. Give me the money. It's expensive! - It isn't, buy it. The money? Give me the money. Are you running away?! My money! Come back! Get out of here! Beat it! Hold on just a second. - Why? You're going around dirty! Where do you come from? Who let you enter the school? Get out of here! Give me back my garlic. You'll see... You're pretty! "Sehr schoen" Very pretty! "Wunderbar!" Great. How were things in Germany, when you lived there? In Germany, The children don't go around alone on the street after 5 pm. They may ride the trains only if they're accompanied by an adult. I had a German colleague, who always used to ask me: How do you eat pineapple there in Africa? He always had cuts on his mouth because he used to eat pineapple with the peel. And I made him see: No, in Africa we don't eat it like that. Let go of me! Money! We don't have any. As of today, you have to start bringing me money. I don't want trouble here in the market. Did you hear me? - I don't have any money. I don't work. The kid has had his punishment. Get out of there, boy. That spot belongs to someone. Why? Because it belongs to someone. - I'll leave when they get here. Nothing doing, leave right now. Don't put your basket there. It's occupied. Leave! There's someone there. There's no place for you there! You're spoiling my things. I want to put my things there. - Someone's coming to sell there. You're throwing me out. - Leave I'm leaving. Hi, Paito. - How's it going, Kadape? Five hundred each. Take one. What would Mom like? - I'd like some garlic. Garlic? - Yes! Today's the day, Kadape! Money! Yesterday you shared my supper. What do you want? - Garlic. What does Grandma want? - A clove of garlic. Today's the day, Kadape! Today you'll pay for my tea. Do you want a candy? - No. Garlic? - Yes. Do you want a shoe? You can try on this one here. Since you're young, when you grow up you'll end up all right. Xano, there's some here. Let's go in. How much does the oil cost? How's it going, Xano? Where are you coming back from? I'd gone home... I've brought a shitload of money. Take it. For you to buy flour. - Where did you get it? I got it at my aunt's place. Who gave it to you? - I got it, that's all. I don't want money that's been stolen. - I didn't steal it. I just took it. How did you do that? You don't know how to take something? You took it? You stole it! Why do you refuse my money? It was stolen. Which is to say that you're not my friend? - I am your friend. But I don't want stolen money. So our friendship has come to an end. It can come to an end. We're finished. Give me the money! - Why? Give it to me and shut up. Give it to me. The money! Starting today you must give me money. What's going on? I'm going to kick the shit out of you! Give the kid's money back. You always go around taking money from the kids. Why? You watch your step! If the police don't deal with you, we will. Where's the dwarf? What's this? I warned you to not get involved! What's going on? - We're forcing open this door. Come out, our German friend. What you mean, Nein, nein?! What's going on? Nothing. We're your friends. This here is Kadape. Fingernail, come out. Boss, the kid's here. You're the friend of the one who refused to give me money. You'll have to be punished. Throw him in here! Come on. Put the guy! Put him! You poured dirty water on my produce! - Dirty water?! Don't touch me. Do you want to fight? I'm going to show you the way it is. I can't go home without my fingernail. My German friend, if I let my fingernail grow, can I also be a photographer? You bastard! Give me my money! - Stop. The thugs took my money off me and it's your fault. I want my money. First, you refused my money. Next, they beat me up. Third, they took my money. So why do you want to go home? Stay here and live in the market. It's good. The gang can have a good life here. I have a plan. You have to help me. If you're my friend, let's go together. I'm asking you please. It's a really cool plan. I'm asking you please. Everything's got soaked! Our clothes! Xano! It's all ruined! Now it's not fit to sell. Our business is down the tubes! Paito, I've got a cool idea. Around twelve-thirty, my aunt leaves the beauty parlour. We can go there and take all the money. They go for lunch. It's a good time. It should work. I don't know how it happened. I always slept with it beside me, in my grasp. When I woke up today, I no longer had it. It's very weird. Very. Maybe even witchcraft. What are you talking about? I don't know what I'm going to do with my life. What's going on, uncle? My axe disappeared. I slept with it, I had it in my hands. When I woke up it had disappeared. It was all that I had left in my life. I have my suspicions about those guys who grabbed our money. It can only be them, if we find them, we'll find the axe. It's very funny. We steal things, and now we're chasing after the thieves. Isn't it odd? Look, a ninja! Get down. He's stealing. Thief! He's stealing! Thief! Give me back my axe. Someone get a tire! Let him be. He's just a kid. Take it easy. I caught the other one. Let him be. Xano, I had an idea. Let's us two open a business. We'll be partners. An honest business! Not go around thieving any more. What do you say, Xano? What's the business? - A good business. This one! The nail polish has arrived. We're going to paint fingernails in the beauty parlour. Queen of the Market Beauty Parlour, we paint toenails and fingernails. We paint fingernails and toenails. Near Kadape's stall.
