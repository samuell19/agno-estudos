Go! BY FORCE for my people... Holy shit! It had to happen some day. I'll be back. Did you see the van? 80 bullets in it, I counted. They used heavy weapons. This time, the bastards took a guy down. - Thanks, we'll expect your report. - Yeah. - What do you want? - I got it all on my cell phone. 5 million pixels. Fucking ace! I get it. Show us some, so we see what it's worth. Who d'you think I am, Santa Claus? You wanna see the film, flash me some cash. 10 grand! I remove my SIM card, the film's yours to use as you please. Your film will never work. It's not worth 10 grand. How about this then? You two go fuck yourselves, and I call VSD or Paris Match! OK? - What the fuck's going on? - Shit, Douchebag Damico. Who's she? - Captain Damico, how are you? - Don't worry about my health. Got something to sell? Nothing. A blurry shot of a car speeding away. Bullshit! I filmed the whole thing. - 5 million pixels, it rocks. - OK, follow me. - Let's take a look. - Dream on, lady. OK, you win. 5 grand, how about it? - How about this? - What the fuck did I do? You got the stuff, I got the cuffs. Shut the fuck up! Get in! - Go on, get in. - Take him away! - Asshole! - Keep still, fuckhead! You won't be so cocky when you find out who I am! Maybe, but right now we hold the cards. Take him away! - What about the other one? - He'll soon tell us who he is. Eat shit and die, motherfucker! Fuck this. Look, the papers say 800 000. Not far off, huh? How the hell do those schmucks get their info so fast? Who knows? Yeah? Yeah. - The Serbs have crossed both borders. - Good. If we get caught, the guard's on them. OK, guys? - Yeah, but a guard down and... - He shouldn't have been there! 150 grand each. Not our best haul. - He's never happy. - I won't get far with this! It's enough to tide you over. Quit whining, we'll do better next time. Let's head out. I fancy a blowjob. I fancy a nice steak. Don't worry Farid, my treat. Quit treating me like a deadbeat! Hey Milo! Whaddya say? - Ciao, Milo! - Kid! What was Fabrice doing there? He'd just bought this armored truck company and he decided to do the rounds with the guards. To think I advised him to go. I'll never forgive myself. Don't blame yourself. We feel for you, Jacques. Thanks, Philippe. Madame Prosecutor, I've asked you here to bring you in on this case right from the word go. No one kills a son of the Republic and goes unpunished. I understand, Minister. Mrs. Canetti, you will head this investigation. Make it a priority. It must be settled as fast as possible. We want these killers behind bars, for life. Madame Prosecutor, you have carte blanche. Very well. I'm sorry Captain, I must send your son to a Youth Detention Centre. In Savigny. - For 6 months. - Your Honor, this is a minor offence. Isn't this a bit harsh? Blah blah blah. Don't I get a say in this? No. Yes? Sorry, I was on duty. Did I miss anything? It's over. You missed the boat, as usual. - The statement, Your Honor? - Goodbye, Your Honor. With the clerk, as usual. - What the hell were you thinking? - Jesus, chill out. Your Mickey Mouse teachers won't scare me or break my spirit! Who do you think you are, little punk? A big shot? Your spirit? You're just a little small-time crook, a dopehead. Pleased with yourself? You see, every guy I put away for 20 years started out like this. Do you understand what's flipping me out, Cyril? Get in. You're not even good at it! You get busted every time. Not by you. Fat chance of that, you're never around. They're called the All Blacks because they dress in black. But we got lucky this time. As usual, they deactivated the surveillance cameras. But this video confirms what witnesses have said about their prior attacks. Do you think it could help identify them? Yes. Well... no. I beg your pardon? It merely confirms what we already know, namely who they really are. But it can never be used as conclusive evidence. Explain. Very well. We've known who they are and been after them for a long time. Allow me to introduce them. Youngest of the gang: Farid Boujimah. He went straight from petty theft to armored vans after months, maybe years, learning how to blast armor-plated steel in junkyards. He's the one we can't pin down. The guy who entered the van with Boujimah: Antoine Giudicelli, Corsican. Owner of a sporting goods shop in Marseilles, President of the Propriano Soccer Club. The really smart one, in criminal terms. No convictions, two dismissals, one acquittal. Also owner of a posh hotel in Nivernais. - And last but not least... - Last? - I thought there were five. - Yes... But we think the other two are foreign thugs used on a one-off basis, probably Eastern European, hired by the guy we think is the boss. The guy who machine-gunned the truck's windshield? Right. The most dangerous one. Jimi Weiss, a gypsy settled in Montreuil, married, two kids. Manager of a bar games company, but actually he controls 100 slot machines in the suburbs. Several convictions, one for 15 years, for armed robbery. If you know who they are, why aren't they in prison? Ironclad alibis. Inconclusive surveillance. An army of lawyers. They disappear until ten days before their next job. Then they surface again. Never a clue, no prints, no DNA... They've not put a foot wrong. Until the death of a Minister's son. But that's all in the past. We have carte blanche. Carte blanche? That's not a new element, Prosecutor. You're right. But this... most definitely is. Library, Dorkel! Manu, my man! What's with you? Look what you gave me, boy! There's more words than pictures. Look at this crap! What's to enjoy? - I thought you might like sci-fi. - Sigh-what? Science fiction, you chicken thief! Give it to me. - What do you want? - Intellectual shit, brother. Blek the Rock, Zembla, Akim. Yeah, Akim, he's like Tarzan's brother. I'll see what I can do, hedgehog face. There's a pro for you! If you can find stashes of gold coins, you can find me Akim. Right, bad boy? Jesus! The shit you have to do to get parole. If you get parole, I'll eat a rat. Well ready your belly, pal. What's that accent? Eastern European. Why? Leave your cart there, Makarov, you've got a visitor. What are you doing here? I heard you're now head honcho of the crime squad. Well done. And that you screwed up that paintings case. Same as ever. Still on the defensive and still as cocky. Sit down. Go on, Manu, please. You have no shame coming to see me here, 7 years later. Don't worry, I'm not here to thank you for my promotion. Well... your prison record is squeaky clean. It's nice to see. Preparing a new career? Who knows? You didn't come to reminisce. No, I have something better for you. I came to offer you... Stop. The last time you entered my life I got 15 years. So if you don't mind... I want you to work for us. Guess you didn't read my file, Super Cop. I never associated with pigs. I know, Makarov. Your prison report says you've decided to go straight for your daughter's sake. What do they call it here? "Baby parole"? Do you really think you'll get out early with your record? This is a unique offer, a new start with a clean slate. Just by doing us a little favor. I know what sort of favor you mean. I don't do that shit. Help us wrap up this case and you go free. No strings attached. You can start over with Hanh and your daughter. We'll give you a new identity, a spotless record, a clean past. Thanks for coming by, Clara, it's been fun. Not many laughs in here. A new identity? My name is Makarov. It's had a good rep in gangland for generations. I didn't even change it when Dad was guillotined. My family doesn't cut deals with cops, and I'm a man of tradition. I'll wait for my parole patiently, like a man. Good luck. Better get to a hairdresser's, your roots are showing. Otherwise, you look almost fuckable. Back to square one. So much for carte blanche. Back to old-style police work. Instead of spinning your wheels on the stolen paintings case and irritating the Foreign Ministry, start doing as you're told when you're told to do it, if you please. I heard about your son. Maybe something can be arranged? Can't we eat in peace? My friends... This is to our success. To my generous brothers. Milo, I love you. I love you, too. To all here, and our Corsican friends who sang so well. Long live free Corsica. I'll crack the champagne. He's nuts! Find the sweet spot... Come on, come on... This is unbelievable! I've had enough. Just wait and see. Cheers. Excuse me... Excuse me! What's wrong, sir? This is intolerable! Tell those people to stop smoking and calm down. Drop it, Albert. We'd like to finish eating in peace. - Come. - Don't be familiar! We're all family here. Meet my partner, explain what's wrong. - Don't go, look at their faces! - I'll just have a word. Good evening, sir. What's wrong? We'd like to eat in peace, and we can't breathe with all the smoke. Really? I'm also not sure the sight of a semi-automatic pistol is reassuring for your customers. They don't look too scared to me. I'm here on vacation with my wife, but I could go to the local police station and tell them about your dangerous sense of fun. A high caliber weapon in full view! And breaching the smoking ban in public spaces. Look, you cocksucker! When you see the cops, ask if they got their champagne. "Public spaces"? This is my place, my friends. Get the fuck out! You don't scare me, sir! You should leave now. Are you deaf? The meal's on me. Take your wife and beat it! - I don't want to owe you anything! - Really? Albert? Are you alright, darling? I'm fine. I humiliated you in front of your wife. If you're a man, if you've got any balls, take your revenge. Pardon me? We're going home. I've had enough. - Let's go. - Shut up! 'Toine, fancy sticking it to the old bag? Makarov. First name? Oliveira Don Assemento di Manuel. What a name! Give me that. Hi, honey. How are you? I spoke to your lawyer. You could get a leave by the end of the month. - We can all celebrate at home. - Yeah, right! I don't hold out much hope. Quit looking on the dark side. I'm sure you'll get your leave. Your Master's Degree, your studies, reorganizing the library, your good behavior... it proves you want to make it, right? Yeah. Go on, Charlotte, show Daddy his present. Thank you, sweetheart. It's so pretty. What's this? A drawing. You blind? Don't get worked up, you know it's not allowed. Gonna make a stink over a kid's drawing? OK. I'll give it back later. You're not going to your cell. They're taking you out. Out where? To court, not Club Med. You're new here, aren't you? Come in! Good afternoon, gentlemen. Uncuff him. Don't bother. This won't take long. I'm in a terrible mood. Your name has come up in connection with an attempted escape. It seems you gave an inmate a complete map of the prison. You've seen too many movies. Have you got a name? A deposition? You know how these things work. The informant wishes to remain anonymous. Does your file mention that I'm waiting for parole, and prison leave? No? Your informer is full of shit. You've got a name, give it to my lawyer. So you can have him killed? So I can sue him for slander. Enough of this crap. Take me back to the joint. Get out! Get out, motherfucker! Lie down! Get out! - What the fuck? - Get out or I'll waste you! Take it easy. What's going on? You got the wrong guy! No, Manu, we didn't. You again? Have all you cops gone insane? Take me back! Sure. But after that escape, with an officer down, you're looking at 20 years, no parole. Is your aim in life to fuck me over? Not done enough? - I'll never work for you! - We'll see about that. Dickhead! Shit! It's OK, now your escape looks even more credible. Bitch! I swear on my daughter that I'll take you out. Him, you, and all your fucking families! No, you won't. Don't tell me you're not happy to be out! See? She's apologizing. Don't whine, you're free. Show some gratitude. Shit, it hurts. I'm bleeding bad. Take me to a hospital. Stop blubbering. It's a flesh wound. Besides, you look like you heal fast. My lawyers will hear about this. Bitch! Manners, Manu. Let go of me, cocksucker! I'll call you soon. Less than a million euros... It's embarrassing! I hope so, because with my share... I won't be living like a king. - What does he do, eat it? - What? He's right. What do you do with your money? Poker, roulette? Or the races at Vincennes? Right! Do I look like a guy who gets jacked out of his money? - My money's making babies back home. - Now we know. You'll know what time it is! It's 11:02. Guys... Why don't we chill for a while? We're all loaded. I agree. I don't! Kid! He looks tired. Go fuck! Go on, get out! Come on. She wants a word. Your hideout is the maid's room on the 6th floor. No elevator. There's money. Get fixed up. - We'll be in touch. - Go on. Here, for the cuffs. It'll be fun, like a brain teaser. Move it! Loser. You moron! - You could have hit an artery! - Don't worry. Makarov's tough. I bet it's not his first. You're lucky. Change the seat. Change the seat? How am I gonna do that? Work it out, Serge! Fucker... There... I feel so good here! How about I go see the ear? Manuel Makarov, a key figure in the Paris crime world, escaped this afternoon during a police transfer. An officer was seriously injured. Makarov was in jail seven years for armed robbery... Dad's on TV! OK, the coast is clear. Wait, the wall's too high. I'm wiped! You've nearly made it. Come on. You're crazy. Look how high it is! Don't be a pussy. Jump or I'm gone. Jeez, you're a pain! Hey, take it easy! Shut the fuck up! I'd like to see you try! Just like Tarzan! Thanks, Dimit, I'll never forget this. It was hell in there. Like the army. Rollcall, make the fucking bed, no dope, nothing! Always being ordered around. Don't sweat it, dude. Now you're out we can do business our way. I know a coke wholesaler, he'll get us all we want. We are gonna hit the big time! You look pretty good for a guy who took a bullet. You take drama classes? Cram it. I fucked up my elbow 'cos of you. - It was just a nudge. - Right... I don't believe it! Where do they go? They meet up with a pal or their gang. I don't know his friends. Always the same old story. We don't know much. Yes? An old man lives opposite the wall where we found the rope. He's insomniac, spends his life at the window. He saw a big black Jeep with a young Black guy who helped the escape. Hanh? I can't talk long. Don't speak, just listen and answer yes or no. Remember where I fell out of a tree, goofing around? Be there in an hour. If you think you're being followed... don't go, OK? Yes. See you soon. Why hide that she came to see you? You might have asked me to accept. Take me for an idiot? OK, enough. I didn't want to worry you. I thought it would just go away. Let's not fight. What will you do now? I'll try to ditch the cops' hideout. To buy some time, think things through. Get me the rest of the money I've got stashed. What money? What d'you mean? There should be about 90 000 left. There's no money in the safe, Manu. I haven't worked in 2 years. I was fired. What? What the fuck? Shit, we've got company! What are they doing here? Fuck it! They must have a wire on the family. They followed the wife. If they pick him up, we're dead! - Do you read me? - Yeah. - See those cars at 2 o'clock? - Yeah. That's another squad. They'll snatch Makarov from under us. Let's have some fun. - Looks like crime squad. - Bingo! You're a long way from home. Bravo, you just lost us a big fish. You were on him too? None of your business. We don't report to you. - In our district you do. - Yeah? Just ask our chief for a report. She'll tell you, nice and polite, how to go fuck yourselves! Sorry for fucking up the biggest catch of your career. Who do they think they are? Friends, goodnight! A Cherokee Jeep, 2001, black. Belongs to a young Black man. I gave you his mugshots. - Jacky, you're the best. Go. - Yeah. - Hello. - Hi. - I'm here for Greg. - He's expecting you. Thanks. If I do a video for the new album, she'll look good. Good job, Greg. I'm really pleased. Paulo, give it a try, take your time. I have to show this man some wood. I know it's risky to come here... What's done is done. Are you crazy? You were about to get parole. The cops in the crime squad busted me out. By force! Insane. Remember Damico? It was her again. Stop! I don't want to hear it. The less I know... I'll get in touch with a guy I know downtown. He'll get you some papers that pass muster. Here, I kept this for you just in case. I don't need it anymore. It was just sentimental. 15 grand. It's your share of some jewelry I sold. It'll tide you over. I guess you'll be getting busy. Thanks, Greg. Take care of yourself. I'll keep an eye on the family. You replaced one jail with another. My cell was cleaner than this. How's the wound? You struggle like mad to break out of your box. It's almost touching. Hanh... Your former partner, Greg Leduc... They now count as guilty of harboring a criminal. I know you can give us the slip, but it wouldn't be smart, or kind. If you do, I'll put them all in jail. - You really are scum. - No. Just a cop, who sometimes does stuff she doesn't want to do. Like what, for example? All this. But you do it. I have no choice. You neither, I guess. You must have done some lousy things in your time. How many did you whack when you were top dog? Rivals, informers, greedy partners... One, two, three, more? So shove your sermons! Why pick on me? The prison's crawling with suckers to do your dirty work. I wanted out of all that. I whacked a few guys, and I'm not proud of it. But now I see my future in my kid's eyes. Then you come and bust my balls with your lousy deal. What do you want? You'll soon find out. Right now, I have other things to do. What are you up to? - Beat it! - Shit! You found me fast. I'm a cop, Cyril. Yeah, I know that. But who are you right now? My mother or the cop? If it's the cop, you came at the right moment. I have a big packet of coke on me. I plan to get rich fast. So, what now? Gonna cuff me or shoot my ass? Stop it, you're no lowlife punk! I'm just your mother. I'm afraid. Afraid for you! Let go, goddammit! - How did you get this? - Don't worry, it's legit. How much is there? Think I'm an idiot? You talk about becoming a snitch, then a fake escape, now money to hide? Take your money! I've had it. With the money, the cops, the waiting, the fear. Bitch! It's the second time she's led us to him. Happy in your cozy house? It was bought with stolen money! Back to that again? It'll be empty by tonight. You'll never see me or Charlotte again. She deserves better. Go see your whore of a cop! Let go or I'll scream. Trust me, Hanh. One last time. No, it's over. I'm done with gangsters. I've had enough. Let go of me! Hanh! Wait! OK, I'll explain. I'm listening. A resale value of between 3 and 5 million euros. - Minus my share. - Share? Come with me. - The standard commission is 10%. - I know. But this is completely anonymous. Deals like this are rare. What is it? Uncut diamonds going to Antwerp, they're not listed yet. - Who put you onto this? - That's my problem. - The less you know... - Don't pull that shit with me. I'm not one of your kike thieves. I like to know what I'm getting into. The days of illiterate Gypsies who say "Amen" to everything are over. - So start talking! - OK, take it easy. My brother works in the business. The jewelers get together to cut their gems in Antwerp. It's cheaper, group rate. - When? - October 22nd. A private jet, leaving Bourget at 8:30 a.m. See? You can be a sweetheart when you try. Now scram. We'll hug when we do the split. Wait, there's a train. - Coach here. - Jonah Lomu! I'm in it too. Something's come up, and it's shiny as hell. Come to Paris. Usual meeting place. Sounds good. - Bye, now. - Ciao, man. I've lost my kid, my wife. Now you're gonna replace her. My roots? What roots? Bastard! What about my informant contract? The cop who took a bullet during your escape is in a wheelchair. Yeah? Already you were in deep shit... You shot him. Doesn't matter. You're the one who'll pay. Let me have my say. You're trapped. What is it with you? Do you dream about me at night? We want the All Blacks and your pal Jimi Weiss. The All Blacks? My "pal"? He's just someone I met inside. A pal you led a prison mutiny with in '95. That creates a bond, I imagine... And you want his head on a platter? You don't have a choice. Neither do I. Those guys are real killers. Maniacs. Do you realize that? Now we're all in the same shit. I'll give you the details later. Right now, I need a personal favor. So, I turn tricks for you now? What favor? Don't get all worked up about this. It was just to calm things down, stop you from doing anything rash. You fuck better than before. Really needed it, huh? The number you have dialed is no longer available. Lie down, you son of a bitch! Get in the car. Quick! Drive! Sit down there. No messing around. I'll be back. What now? I dunno. Spell it out for him. Isn't that your job? He won't listen to me. A sensitive kid like him, if he gets locked up, he'll come out even worse. With a big-time cop for a mother, they'll destroy him. You know what I mean. - What about his father? - Forget him. Give him a scare. Maybe it'll bring him to his senses. Who the fuck are you? What d'you want? I'll ask the questions. What d'you think? You're gonna be a billionaire? A kingpin? Everyone's gonna kiss your hand? Listen. At best you get 10 years, 20 if your luck is crap. If you don't get put down like a dog. Or you end up in a hole like this. Pretty lame, huh? Jeez... I don't get it. Why am I here? What about me? Lecturing a 16 year old punk with fucked up dreams. OK, I'll lay off your turf. Turf? What fucking turf, dipshit? And your parents? Ever think about them? My mother's a cop, and my old man's a soldier. They don't give a shit! What the hell do you know? You're full of crap. Consider yourself lucky. To thank me for not shooting you, give me your supplier's address. You can go once we settle this with him. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Go on, tell me. - It's nothing. It's my wife. Since she got Internet, she's gone wacko. Internet? She found out that Gypsies come from Punjab, so she's learning Punjabi. She put incense everywhere, stupid statues, opium den rugs... She answers me in Punjabi, so I can learn the language of my ancestors. Punjabi with a Montreuil accent. I'm in hell! And? Now she wants to go on a pilgrimage to Chandigarh, the land of our ancestors. I don't give a flying fuck about India or elephant taxis! So? So it's war, 'cos I don't wanna go. She's thrown me out. I crash in my old man's trailer down the yard. Even so, she sends the kid with tandoori chicken every day! I'm losing it. But she's right, you do look kinda Hindu. - He's got a point. - Yeah? Look at you, you're so tanned you look like the head on your flag. Right, what's this job? A plane loaded with uncut diamonds. We walk away with... But Jimi, a plane, diamonds? You're insane. I prefer cash. Let's do a loot limo, as usual. Yeah, planes are complicated. My granny prefers cash too, but for a million or two each, why be picky? And a guy we can't trust... Don't worry about him. Let's go, I've got a hot date. With patchouli perfume? What's he doing with my card? Making a double? Sit down, you! 'Toine! Here they come. Shit, look! I don't believe it. Look at the Corsican's shirt. Know what that is? An All Blacks shirt from their 1926 European tour. 30 matches, 30 wins. They were called "The Invincibles". Are they taunting us? Who knows? How long will it take them to lose their tails? If they're in Paris, it'll go down soon. That's for sure. Can we trust your man Makarov? You don't think he'll fuck us over? Do the job then split? Cut the bullshit. - Brought your chick, have you? - Chick? Listen, dickhead. Sell any more dope to this little shit... Who are you? Doesn't matter. Do as I say, you'll never see me again. What if I want to run things my way? Lousy little snitch! We stopped the bleeding in his lungs, but your son is still in a coma. Will he pull through? He's in critical condition. It's too early to say. - Can I sit with him? - No, he's in a sterile room. There's no point staying here, either. Go home. I'll keep you posted, I promise. Goodbye. What have I done? What the hell have I done? OK, I'll see what I can do. Thanks, Milo. You can't stay here. Johnny! - Drive him to Paris. - Sure. Makarov, visitor! - Everything OK? - So-so. That Gypsy is the fastest guitarist in the world. Are you sure? Forget it. Guess you don't know shit about music. OK, they've made contact. I can't believe it was so easy. Nothing stops these guys hooking up. OK, cut him loose. We don't want to be spotted now. They'll vanish soon, anyway. I gave Makarov one of our phones. Things are gonna heat up. Keep me posted. I'm going back to the hospital. OK. Hang in there. I read about you in the paper. Who sprung you? Some Romanians I met inside. They vanished after the breakout. Way to go. I work with Eastern guys too. They're tough. Why did you go to my brother to get in touch? - Guess. - You're broke? Flat broke! I can't trust anyone else for a job before I head out. - Where to? - Depends how much I get. India, maybe. What is it with India? No sign of improvement. We've done a scan. Strangely, it wasn't the bullet that did the most damage but the fall. His head must have slammed the ground, knocking him out. He has a serious brain lesion. That's what caused the coma. Can we have some time with him? Sure. I haven't told you everything. Come on. You can stay here for now. They won't come looking for you. If the cops come sniffing, they'll spot them a mile off. - I don't know what to say, Jimi. - Then don't. We led a revolution together. Remember being on the roof dodging teargas grenades? That revolution didn't turn out so well. You can't win every time. Go inside. Look, I'm onto something big, but I gotta clear it with my partners. You know how it goes in a team. You can't do as you please. - An armored van? - No. Much more complicated. I gotta go. OK, thanks. Why bring in a guy we don't know? On the run, with cops on his ass. If we need manpower, we hire some Slavs, like usual. That's just it, the guy's on the run. He's in shit. In Corsica, we don't walk away from a guy in the shit. Think you're still in the old country? Manu Makarov isn't some punk. He's the real deal. Anyway, we need another man. I knew Manu inside, he's a good guy. Ten years back, he was top dog. And now? After 7 years in lock-up, think he's still sharp? Sure he is. Besides, he's hungry for it. OK, I say he's in. Enough talking! Me too. Don't sulk, little brother. What're we gonna do? What does he always say? - We'll be sitting pretty. - We'd fucking better! Right. I have some good and some very good news. What do you want first? You're in. A plane, on the runway in Bourget. Uncut diamonds. The very good news: resale value of 5 million. 5 million, minimum. But please, forget India. If we ever hook up again I'd prefer some other spot. Long story. Here. From now on, we only talk on this. Here's the SIM card. This... is where we meet up after we lose our tails. I'm not gonna teach you how it's done. Just do it right. Take one of the bikes outside. Be there, tomorrow night. What do I mean, Jimi? Got curry in your ears? Manu, Farid. I don't know about you guys, but it was tough this time. I had every cop in Paris on my ass! And? I lost the motherfuckers. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. Where do we start? Fender tag? Fender tag! - I think I'll take it. - OK. - That'll be 156 euros. - No problem. - Get out. - What did he say? - Am I talking Chinese? Beat it! - OK. The camera's not hooked up. It's for the insurance. I wouldn't sell much if it was. What do you need? Four combat uniforms. Black. Reinforced silk. I just got some in. It's going down at Bourget. A plane with diamonds. Good job. Got the flight number? Want the pilot's birthday, too? Your son any better? Not really. I'll call you back. - Sparkling water, please. - Yes, sir. We'll get the gear from storage. OK. I've got the phones. I gotta take a leak. Let's go. - Your drink? - I'm not thirsty. Where does this go? In your ass, Farid. This is what we use to break into the cockpit. We're not breaking into anything. The job is off, your friend is a fucking rat! What are you doing, Farid? Manu Makarov, a snitch! What have you been smoking? When I got to the bar he was on the phone. When he saw me he looked spooked. - He hung up fast. - So what? Then he went to the bathroom and I hit redial on his phone. Guess who answered. Who, goddammit? The Paris fucking police station. In person! From the start you didn't want him. What's this shit about the police? This is serious, man. Yeah, it's serious. This came from the same police station. From a friend of Greg Leduc, my old partner. I called to fix a meet. He's making me a passport so I can leave the country. See? Nothing to get all fired up about. Idiot! What the fuck? - What's going on? - Here, Inspector Farid. - Call me a snitch, motherfucker? - Manu! What's wrong with him? Fuck! - Farid! - He's dead. He's out cold! The hospital will patch him up. Patch him up? We can't go to Emergency with a corpse in a stolen car! You're nuts! We're in shit. Farid, wake up! Shit! There. Manu, it was an accident. I didn't want this, Jimi. You couldn't let him call you a rat. - What do we do? - If he's dead, he's dead. Antoine, wait... Are we sure about this? Jimi! You're cracking up! I listened for his heart. He's dead! - His face is white. He's dead! - Get a grip! Manu, light up his face. Va in pace. How are we gonna blow the door of the plane now? We're in deep shit. I used explosives in the Legion. Want me to try? Manu, that was decades ago! This burns me up! I felt so sure about this score. Move it! If we get picked up now, we get life. How did you get in? You're not the Queen of England. Guess what? I smoked Boujimah. - What? - He worked out that I called you. Things got out of hand. You came to tell me it's over? I nearly got put down, and all you care about is the job? That's not what I meant. What do we do now? For me, I mean. You'd better honor the contract. However it turns out, I did my job. Now you do yours. Not asking after Cyril? What are you talking about? I don't give a shit about your son, or you, or your ass, or your life. You came for me. Make this right and we're done. How do I know this isn't your doing? What d'you want to hear? That I plugged your son? Go fuck yourself! Know what? You're a real prick. Yeah, right. Keep your word and sort this out. You know where to find me. Here, I solved your problem. This is the emergency key to open the plane door. Kindly ask our mercenary not to shoot the rest of the team. Not yet, anyway. How is your son? Nothing new. He may stay in a coma. I'm truly sorry. If you play with fire, people get burned. Excuse me? Hold on... You were leaning on Makarov, your son escapes from juvie, his pal is assaulted in the street. Next, a dealer he worked with gets killed. Soon after, a man brings your kid with a gunshot wound to the Emergency. As Chief Prosecutor for the city of Paris, I could request a full investigation. Let's just say this is your business, however disturbing. And I have other fish to fry. I bet you do. You don't like me. It's mutual, I think. I joined the police out of conviction. I came up through the ranks. Your father got you here, since he didn't have a son. Think being out on the streets gives you the right to judge me? I believe in the justice system of my country. You call this justice? My faith is fading fast, thanks to you. Do you know the risks Makarov is taking? Risking the life of a repeat offender to wipe out these shameless killers is a good deal. Yeah. To please the authorities, a minister or two. You'll get a promotion? You'll see, the fun's over now. If you come out on the streets. Excuse me, I have to talk to my son. Where do I say I found this? On the flea market? You'll think of something. You're good at sweet-talking your partners. These guys won't end up making guitars. The guards are leaving. Door's closed. Signal when the propellers start, and again when it starts to roll. OK. Flight 8013, you're set for runway 22. They're in place. I'll block them from behind. What the hell's going on? Abort the takeoff! A hold-up? What is this crap? We just heard. Stop pestering me with questions. The police will intervene. I have employees in the hangars! Shut up and let me do my job. Flight 8013, move even an ear and we send a rocket. You read me? Loud and clear. We won't move. Our objective is the Kangoo! OK, we'll block it. Who's he shooting at? It's Canetti. She's gunning for Makarov! Drive! It's Makarov, nobody shoot! What the fuck's he doing? Police! Nobody move! Now we do this my way. I have a hostage. Cover me! Come on, nice and easy. Shit. Hands on your heads! I said hands on your heads! - I thought you wimped out. - Are you nuts? Unmask, Weiss. - We're all here for you. - Yeah? Tough shit. Damico. Mention our deal and you're dead. Don't worry. Shithead! I fucking knew it! Don't drop off. SWAT will be here soon. Someone ratted us out. I bet it was the trader! It doesn't matter. Give me the radio. Hands on your heads! Don't you speak French? Heads down! This is Makarov. - Can you hear me? - How do I answer? Use this. This is Prosecutor Canetti. Go ahead, Makarov. Canetti... We'll leave in two stages. First a guy will come out and leave in the Hummer. I'll stay with Captain Damico. Anyone tries to stop the Hummer, I shoot her in the throat. OK, stay calm. We'll do as you say. I'm in the control tower, I lead this operation. I'll come down to give orders. OK, Makarov? Don't play for time, cunt! They're coming out now! This is Canetti. Let the Hummer through, we'll get it later. - Come with me. - I'm staying. I'll cover you. We'll take her with us! I'm staying. Take the briefcase and go. I don't get it. What the fuck's going on? I'm a dickhead, Jimi. Just grab the briefcase and go. Or I'll have to put a slug in you. Please, Jimi. You're in luck this time, but we'll meet again. I hope so, Weiss. Shit, Antoine! I'll get that cunt, I swear! Bastards! See you around! Grenade! Fuck! Help! Help me! Back up! No fucking way! Think you can get me? I'm Jimi Weiss! Welcome to the party, guys! Serve Minot, Crime Squad. A hostage was taken after the failed hold-up of a plane heading to Antwerp. One attacker was killed. Another has fled, and the last man is still on the plane. Sources say the hostage taker is Manuel Makarov, who made the front page recently after he escaped from police custody. No blinding grenades. If Makarov shoots too soon, it'll be bad. A bullet in a wing full of fuel. Exactly. It's Makarov's wife. She saw it on TV and called us. Best she speaks to the boss. Yes? Prosecutor Canetti. - That's my friend on the plane. - So it would seem. - And? - And, er... We can't negotiate, miss. - Wait! - Goodbye. Well? What did she want? Nothing. Nothing that can help us, anyway. I'll go check the security perimeter. Do you intend to stay here long? No. What are you going to do? Get us out of this fucking tin, safe and sound. Cocky bastard. Get us out... Don't move, you! Sit down! I'll shove you right in the shit. Life will be nice and calm soon. No bad guys or career plans to chase. Lots of time to take care of your son. All will become clear. - Hello? - Makarov... What are your demands? You've brought things to a standstill. I want a billion euros and a flying saucer. Only joking. It's to relax my hostage, she needs it. - Right, I'll only say it once. - I'm listening. I want a team of journalists. I have a great story to tell. Of course. Journalists? You want an editor too? I imagined you more diplomatic. Do it or I top her and blow the plane. Get it, cunt? Watch it. I speak for the Interior and Justice Ministers. I don't give a flying fuck. If I don't see a camera soon, this thing blows. OK? Here's what I'm gonna do. I'll cut the radio, call me when you've decided. Makarov? Makarov! Good news... Unhoped-for, even. Why? - Who are you, anyway? - Dr. Meyer, SWAT negotiator. Yes? Damico's son just died. The hospital couldn't reach her, obviously. So they called the father. He's on his way. I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen to reason. Shit! That's all we need. Is that all you've got to say? You cold-hearted bitch. Makarov wants journalists? We'll send him some, larger than life. At best we could take him down, at worst the guys can scope out the situation inside. Sounds good. You! Are you a journalist? - What are your demands? - What demands? Get out. Get the hell out! Shut the door. You! Stay there. Put down the camera and strip. - Madame, gentlemen... - Minister. What's the situation? Not good. Makarov's no fool. Yes, but they got one of their men on the plane. I want to see Prosecutor Canetti! Calm down, Colonel. Canetti's busy right now. Is that so? Intercept Colonel Damico! He's in uniform. He's heading for the East gate. Stop him, he's armed! - Is that on? - Yes. Right... My name is Manuel Makarov, I'm a repeat offender. I got 15 years for armed robbery. I'll be brief. I was in my cell, minding my own business, waiting for parole so I could live a normal life with my wife and daughter. Then they decide to spring me. By force. High-ranking fuckers in some ministry, to make me an informer, a snitch. The only reason I'm here is because of the French police and justice system. Is this true, Captain Damico? It is. You can cut. Get out. What about them? They get out after me. Where's Canetti? I want to speak to the Prosecutor. He's the Captain's husband. He thinks Makarov killed his son. Really? This is the pilot. It's over, we're coming out. - I don't believe it. - We'll be right there. Come on, Clara. - You OK? - Don't worry about me. Bring me Colonel Damico. Get out of the car, please. This way. Come in, Colonel. Please take a seat. Can I get you anything? A glass of water? I also lost a son because of these bastards. Leave me alone. Very well. As you wish. It's over. Cyril's dead. No! Let's go, Michel. My name is Manuel Makarov, I'm a repeat offender. I got 15 years for armed robbery. I'll be brief. I was in my cell, minding my business, waiting for parole so I could live a normal life with my wife and daughter. Then they decide to spring me. By force. High-ranking fuckers in some ministry, to make me an informer, a snitch. The only reason I'm here is because of the French police and justice system. Is this true, Captain Damico? It is. You can cut. Where's that from? The pilot's mic. Makarov wanted the interview recorded near the cockpit. Now I know why. Get me a copy of that recording, immediately.
