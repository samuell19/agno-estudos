The swamps of Southern Arkansas. Stretching out for miles and miles, the beginning of a new day. Been repeating itself for centuries upon centuries, some of these bottom lands. Some of these great Cyprus have stood here before the Vikings sailed the seas in their long ships. Towering above this back watered country watching and listening to a multitude of light, old and new. It is here that rivers are born and creeks and slews branch off and cross this vast wilderness. Leaving dense thickets and big timbers that rise up out of this murky, soggy earth. Beaver, mink, birds, raccoons, snakes and alligators are but a few of the creatures that make up the swamp's ledger. Sometimes it's eerie and sometimes pristine. First to 10 (Mumbles) 40 with less than six minutes left, Bill, I'd say Arkansas is at the end of the chase. Ah, yeah, hello, I mean Dr. Lockhart's Office. Out of the south and about 15 miles per hour. Yep, yes, Sir. He's at the game, Sir. Get him, Sir, he's at the stadium with 75,000 insane hog callers. Yes, Sir, all right, right away, Sir. (Mumbling) Go, go, go! (Mumbling) Yes, Sir. Listen, we appreciate you calling us. We should be in Texarkana before dark, yes. Okay, thank you very much, good bye. All right, we got everything, we got the Jeep, camper, got the computer, mic sensors. Everything but the mic sensors. Okay, where's your friend Leslie? She should be here any time. Tim, go ahead and get the mic sensors, put them in. They should be ready then. All right, take a look at this. Hey, girl, how are you? Hi! There you are. Yeah. Anybody tell you where we're going? Yep, Texarkana. They tell you we're gonna be in the woods most of the time? Well she said we're going down looking for some kind of wild man, why? You just don't look like you're dressed for the occasion. Well I brought my jeans and shorts. I certainly hope so. Load up and let's go. All right. Come on. My name is Brian C. Lockhart. My friends call me Doc. I'm a professor of anthropology at the University of Arkansas, located deep in the Ozark Mountains. With me, one of my freshman students, Tim Thorn, Miss. Landwalker, all I know about her is she's a good friend of Tanya Yazzie, one of my prized students. After my call from the Miller County Sheriff's Department, we were soon leaving the rolling hills of Northern Arkansas behind and headed for the swamps in Delta Country around Texarkana, Arkansas. Texarkana, laying on the southwest corner of the state, borders Texas and is but a few short bows from the Louisiana State Line. Our objective, investigate the latest report about the legendary Boggy Creek Creatures attack on a sheriff's deputy. ♪ But darling ♪ ♪ I'll be here ♪ Can I help y'all? Good evening. Good evening. Do you have any ammunition? Yes, Sir. I need a box of 30-30 shells. Regular or hollow point? Doesn't matter. ♪ Is it wrong ♪ Y'all goin' campin'? I guess you could say that. We're looking for the Boggy Creek Creature. There ain't no such thing, you know. I guess that's why we're here, we're gonna try to determine if there is one or not. You can take my word for it, there ain't no monsters around here. I believe that's about all we need. Hey, boy, what do you think you're gon' find that marsh? Gonna find him in the swamp if it exists. Bet he don't. He's been seen over 100 times since the early '50s. Seen by who, drunks or city folks like you all wantin' your names in the newspaper? What do I owe you? Well that'll be $16.69 please. Thank you. You're welcome. You know, something, Will, we ought to go down there to that swamp tonight with a monkey suit and these here folks would stay tomorrow night in a motel in the city. You know something? I believe there's a creature here. And being a city fella, like I am, I'm scared to death of it. That's why I got a 30-30 rifle in the back of that Jeep and I bought this box of shells. In fact, I'm so afraid of it, I just might shoot a monkey that jumped out on me. Good day, Sir. That's W.L. Slogan's farm that we studied about right there. You think he'll let us go look in the barn? Yeah, let's go look in it. 'Sides, we might find something. Run up to the farmhouse to see if they'll let us go down to the barn and look around, okay? I bet she didn't want us around here. Okay, hey, y'all, come on! Come on. Thank you very much. Atwoods, late in the afternoon, Slogan came into that field there driving his cows. He had to have put 'em in that stall right there. But it was in this barn where he saw the creature. Let's look in here a minute. You know, they said Slogan was in his late 60s. I think it was in about '63 or '64. It was '64. That's correct, it was in the fall of the year. In fact, it was probably about this time of day, late afternoon. Coming from that field, all those cows over here in the stall. Come on, go. Get in there. That's about all anybody knows about the incident. In fact. Slogan wouldn't tell anybody about it for years. He was afraid people would laugh at him. Doc, do you think it's true? Yeah, I think he saw what he said he did. Because Slogan had hunted and fished these bottomed lands all his life. He wasn't afraid of anything and he certainly wanted no publicity. It was only after his brother said that he saw it in the woods back in there. Slogan told him the incident here in the barn. He probably did that to give some validity to what his brother's story was. What are you guys afraid of? Think he might still be in here? It's only been 20 years. Doesn't mean he couldn't come back. Yeah, hell, this might be his hang out. Well I'll tell you one thing, the morning that Slogan came in this barn, he was probably standing just about where Tim's standing right now, right there. Damn if I wanna stand where he stood. I think I wanna go back to the Jeep. You ain't waitin' on me. Tim, hand me that map out of there. Let me check somethin' here. Let's see. That sign back there said Sulpfur River. Are we there yet? We're close, isn't it? Got about a mile or so more. Good, I can finally change these clothes. There we go. Y'all wait in the Jeep. Hey Doc, what is it? Looks like a dead deer. Let's go look at it. No way, I'm not gonna go down there and look at a dead deer. Looks like a car or truck hit it not long ago either. What happened to its head? I don't know. What happened to the car or truck is the question. I don't believe any car or truck hit this deer. Why do you say that? Something's hittin' on its rind hind quarter. Doesn't matter, let's get it out of the road before somebody else runs over it and has a wreck. I still don't believe any car or truck hit this deer. Well, doesn't matter, it's probably a bobcat, raccoon or somethin', who knows? Might be it belongs to the creature. We're close to the swamp. We're gonna make camp right here, right here. That's pretty good, Tim. In fact, I'd say that that's pretty close to what it actually looked like. Let me see. You've got to be kidding. Nope, fits all the descriptions. You mean to tell me that we're camped down here in the swamp where that thing might be living? Well I think it's sexy. Well I think we're all crazy if we don't go to town and get a motel room. I wouldn't worry a lot about it, I don't think he's been seen in a few days anyway. It doesn't mean anything either. You think he just dropped dead? No, but if the facts are right in that computer, I'll tell you this, we could come across him or see him at any time. What do you mean by that? Meaning that every year since 1956, when these river bottoms and these swamps are flooded with water, brings him out. In fact, he's never been seen in a drought year. You mean the hot water drives him out of the swamp, right? Exactly. Brings him out and search for food. In fact, we already had a lot of rain this year, believe me. After breakfast, we hit the back country roads. I knew there were a lot of old, abandoned homesteads around and I figured we'd spend our first morning just getting acquainted with the area. Hey Doc, can we get out and look around? Yeah, why not, I don't think anybody lives here. This is an eerie lookin' old place. Looks like our old college room. Mad dog, mad dog! Get in the house, get in the house! Mad dog! Get over here, hold this door. Oh my god, what have we gotten ourselves into? Quiet! Tim, do you see him? No. All right, check those other rooms. Be quiet, stay there. Tim? Look out those windows. Where are you going, don't leave me, we gotta hold the door. Quiet! See anything, Tim? Get back! My god, what's going on? What's going on, Doc? Quiet! Did you hit him, Doc? I don't think so, he moved on me. Watch that window! I was too close. He almost got into this damn house. Jesus Christ. Just hold the door. See him? (Mumbles) Where, where? He was right here at the door! He almost came in on us. Quiet, quiet, he's in this house. He's under here. Doc, I don't think I hear him anymore. Quiet, quiet. God! Tim, there's a hole in the floor! Look in that closet over there, hurry! See if you can find something to put over this hole. Stay, stay. No, stay. Doc, are you okay? I'm okay. Jesus. Is he dead? He's dying if he's not dead. Get in the Jeep. Let's get out of here. Jesus Christ. I don't believe this. I think that gun's a little bit too loud. Tim, give me some shells. This is crazy. Well, Mr. Professor, what exciting things do you have planned for us tomorrow? Yeah, I think that mad dog was a little bit too much for all of us. You let me tell you somethin' right now. I don't think I promised any of us a picnic when we come off on this trip, did I? True enough, that confrontation with the mad dog was a close call for all of us. But in order to find out more about the reported sightings, I knew we had to get out into the field and investigate the area. We had to drive those back country roads and talk to people. Most of the sightings have occurred at early dusk or late evening. Leading me to believe that this creature must be nocturnal. Also there have been those who have claimed to seen more than one of them and they say they admit a foul odor. Roaming about in the night in search of food, always hiding from man, like the Sasquatch or the Big Foot, along with the Yeti of Tibet, all of these man-like creatures are known to be very shy. Making them elusive and hard to find. Day time glimpses are very rare. Although they appear to be docile and never intentionally harmed anyone, there is one incident that's always intrigued me. It was sometime in the fall, a few years back. An elderly gentleman by the name of Otis Tucker was on his way home from grocery shopping in Texarkana when he had a blow out on a lonely stretch of road that runs parallel to the swamp. Oh good Lord, have mercy. Hello? Anybody there? Anybody there? Otis Tucker never regained consciousness. He stayed in the hospital for over two years. Therefore he was never able to tell anybody what happened. Tell her about the billfold. What about it? Well when they found Mr. Tucker that night, his billfold was still in his pocket and he still had $80 in it. Ruling out any chance of robbery. Whatever it was, it pushed the pickup right off the jack and down into the ditch. Gees. That's true, there was not one dent anywhere on that truck which means no other car could've come along and side swiped it. And they said that man didn't have an enemy in the world. That's also true. Whatever attacked him was parable. It drug him down that ditch for over 50 yards. They found one mark on him. Big, soft bruise up here on his fore head. Anyway, I tell you what, it's getting late. I wanna run a test on that computer. I wanna set out those sensors 'cause I wanna be sure that I can set it this home base and watch this entire area. Tim, why don't you get the sensors out? I'll get the computer going and you guys get the walkie-talkies and let's set it up and run a test, okay? The circles, what do they represent? Well, see this first line that's 200 meters, then we come into 75, 50 and of course this square here, that represents the home base. We should be able to sit right here and monitor this whole area. Hm, so you mean if anything approaches the camp, we should be able to see it. Depends how sensitive we set these sensitizers. For instance, there are two ways we can do it. We can set this up for weight or we can set it up for height. Let's run this first test on weight. For instance, Tanya's about 110 pounds, so I'm gonna enter that in now. Okay, Tim, I'd say is about 130. That's in. Now there's one other thing I gotta do. We need to set this at anything over 100 pounds to set it off, so 100 pounds because like snakes or small animals, raccoons or something, we don't want to set it off. This raise them on the radio and run our test. All right, Tanya, do you read? Yeah, I read, it's just me and a whole bunch of blood thirsty mosquitoes. Tim, do you read? Loud and clear. Hey, Doc, how long do you want me to wait out here? I'm gettin' hungry. That boy's always hungry. Okay, gang, we're all set up here. I'll tell you what I want you guys to do now. I want you to start back to the base and I want you to come directly at me and try to come in a straight line, okay? Got ya. Look here, okay, there's Tim, see? Okay, see this dot, that's Tanya, she just broke the first 200 meters right there. Okay, baby is working like a charm. The marvels of modern science. Brian, what's that? I don't know, something broke the southwest corner of the perimeter there. It's moving toward Tanya. Don't panic now, hold this a minute. Could be a deer, could be a car or anything. Let me put some weight in to see what it says. I'll go to 250. Southwest corner. It's over there (Mumbles). I'll go to 400 pounds. We got a problem, give me that mic. Tanya, I don't want to alarm anybody but there's something just broke the southwest corner of the perimeter, do you hear or see anything? Doc, I don't see a thing. It's moved more than 50 yards in the last few seconds. Something's out there and it's heading toward Tanya. Tell 'em to come in, Brian. You guys, I want you to come back to the base and I want you to come back quickly. Tim, come on, move it, get in here now. Come on, Tanya, move. I want you to stay on this mic and watch that screen. Here, take this. I'm going out there, there is something wrong. Run, girl, run! Keep me posted. Come on, come on, come here before it's dark. Is it him? I don't know, keep going, get to camp. Doc? Yeah, come on, I read you. It's close to you. My left or right? Hold. Where are you at? I smell ya! You better say somethin'! Oh god, thank god you're all right. What's going on? You all right? I'm okay. Bri, it's gone. It was there and it just disappeared. It's fast, I've never seen anything that fast in my life. Where's Tim? I don't know. Oh, no. Let me check this. My god, he's not there. Wait a minute. He is not there. Boo. Boy, you shared the shit out of us. Oh, no. I thought you'd be in between it. Wake up. Hey, we got a visitor. We got a visitor, come on. Look at this. He just passed the 200 meter perimeter right there. I can't take anymore of this. Oh, well, just listen, just watch him one minute. Doc, are you sure it's him? Positive, I just put in 350 pounds, then I went to 400 and it was exactly where I thought he'd be. 10 between. Doc, let's get out of here. Wait just a minute, we're gonna watch him. He's still away yet, look. He stopped. Here he goes. He's moving north, (Mumbles). Look at him! He's circling this camp. I don't believe it. He's watching us. He's turning back, he's come across at 50 now. Doc, he's headed for the camp. Hold it! Shut up, hold it! We lost power, be quiet, I gotta hear. Don't panic, nobody panic. I gotta be able to hear it. Now it's important, get that candle over here. Get us some light in here. Tim. Did you put gas in the generator? Cut it out, we gotta be quiet, I gotta hear. Everything depends on that, give me that gun, quick. Give me the gun, take this light. All right. Give me the dart. Oh my god, Brian, not that. Listen, it may be the only chance we have. If it's him, I'm gonna try to stop him right now. Okay, now listen, it's important, do not panic because we may not ever get this chance again. Now you gotta be quiet. So I can hear. Listen, Tim, where's the gas? It's just outside. All right, you get the gas can, you guys stay right here and be quiet, let's go, move. Y'all be careful. Let's go. All right, hold it. Let me see that light. Quiet in there. Move to the end, wait a minute, hold it right there. Quiet! Where's the gas can? It's under there. All right, get it, come on. Hurry! Crank it. Move it. Talk to me. No! What kept attracting him to come back around our camp puzzled me. The dart gun was a mistake. He simply reached and pulled it out. Everyone was so shook up after last night including myself, I decided to tell them one more story that was a little bit on the lighter side. The story I heard goes something like this. Oscar Colputter was his name. Just what are you lookin' for? I'm lookin' for the Sears Roebuck catalog. Well I guess you're gonna mess up the whole house for it? I will if I have to, I'd rather do that than mess up my pants. Well we certainly don't want that. The catalog's on the back porch. Damn cows, you can't even take a crap in peace. Myrtle, is that you? Tryin' to take a crap. Myrtle help! God, hold on, Oscar! Myrtle, help! My god, hold on, Oscar, I'm comin'! What the hell was that after you, Oscar? Damn if I know, Myrtle, I thought it was you. It was the wildest thing I've ever seen. Well you gonna get that stuff off of you? Yeah, hand me that catalog in there, let me clean myself up. Gonna take more than a catalog, Oscar. If ya ask me, it's gonna take the water hose. (Mutters) So much mess, so much, golly! How much truth there is to this story, I couldn't say. I can tell you for sure that Oscar Colputter is a retired attorney from Texarkana and is known from time to time to have had a drinking problem. Anyway, back to the more serious side. I reached Deputy Williams by phone and arranged a meeting at the local coffee shop. I decided I would not tell him or anyone, at this point, about seeing the creature myself last night and I advised Tim and the girls to do the same. I wanted to hear from Williams and his version of what he said it looked like without my input. Okay, y'all don't forget anything now. Morning. Good morning, Sir. You must be Deputy Williams. You Dr. Lockhart? I am. Let's get some coffee. All right. We've been studying incidents about what people say happened to them around here for years. Well mine's pretty simple, I don't have any answers and I doubt if anybody else does. Talked to the sheriff before I left Fayetteville and he told me a little bit about what happened to you but I'd like to get some more details if I could. That'd be fine, that'd be fine. Would there be anything else, Sir? I think that's all. Thank you. Well that day, I've been fishin' down on Sulpfur River, it was late in the afternoon, it wasn't dark and I went to the shed. Did you catch any fish? Few. Take 'em down to the shed and clean 'em, I don't want them smelly things up here. No one believes me. My wife doesn't even think I've seen such a thing. That thing was huge. His eyes glarin' out under that hairy forehead. He had a pointed skull. You ever think it meant you any harm? Nope, I think he just smelled dead fish and just came up to investigate. Sounds like that little one was hard to get off your back though. He was strong as hell. I didn't think I was ever gonna get loose. I had to go into town and get my back sewed up. Took nine stitches. Well, Skid, I don't mean to be laughin' but how you doin' now? Well the stitches come out tomorrow. By the way, have you talked to Old Man Crenshaw? Don't believe I've ever heard of him. He's an old man, I'll bet he's lived on the bottoms all his life. He could be able to tell you somethin'. Do you think he's ever seen it? He was goin' on there every month callin' in the department. Complainin' and when he'd come into town for supplies, he was always talkin' about the creature hanging around his cabin. I'll definitely have to find him. Is there anything else that you can think of, maybe some details you might've forgot. No. I will say, Old Man Crenshaw always said one thing about the creature. What's that? He was an incredible runner and an unbelievable swimmer. All right, you guys, it's ready, come and get it. What are we having? Bologna sandwiches and pork and beans. Great, one of my favorites. Well it's not one of mine. Tanya, do you have my blush? Blush? No, I don't have your blush. Guys, I don't want to be down here anyway, let's go into town and get a motel. Are we goin' in the swamp with you guys? Not today. You're gonna leave us a rifle, aren't you? The rifle, you wouldn't know what to do with it if I did. Wanna bet? Tim and I began searching behind the camp, hoping we might find hair or even a small blood sample from where the creature had torn off through the woods. Can you drive the Jeep? Sure, why? This is crazy. What do you mean by that? We're fools, we're just sitting here. Who says that thing only comes out at night? It could be watching us right now. These folds are fixin' me right. Trooper Williams left out one important fact. He said nothing about the foul odor the creature emits which was still very much present many hours after Tim and I were in the forest. I knew we should've stayed at the camp. Well I don't believe we came this way. I don't remember these mud holes. We had to have, we went through several mud holes. But not these, they're too deep. Do you know how to put that thing into four wheel drive? Hell no, I don't, I've never been in one of these things until I came up on this stupid trip! Then you just better hold on. You've done it now. Me, it was your idea to go riding around in the first place. Put the damn thing in four wheel drive and let's get out of here. I don't know how to put the damn thing in four wheel drive. Maybe there's a manual in here that will tell us how to do it. It's gonna take us more than four wheels to get us out of this hole, like about eight. Quit jokin', we gotta figure this thing out. It's getting late. I'm not jokin', the mud's almost up to our doors. Look, here it is, this is all we have to do. There, that should be in four wheel drive. Crank it up and let's get out of here, okay? It's no use, we're gonna have to walk out of here. My god, don't even suggest such a thing. It'll be dark soon. I'm open for your suggestions. Well blow the horn. Blow the horn? What good is that gonna do? Well Tim and Brian are down here somewhere. Maybe they'll hear it. Tim and Brian have probably been back at the camp for hours, resting, eating, dry, comfortable. Don't tell me that stuff. Trade places with me, I wanna try. No way, you're just gonna make it worse. But we're lost, remember. I'm not gonna go start walking up in these woods looking for a camp that we have no idea where it is. Might get a little cold before the night's over. We do have a heater in this thing, don't we? Yep, I believe we do. How much gas we got? Over half a tank. Good. Today's Tuesday, they should find us before the weekend and we run out of gas. You got me into this mess, I wanna get out and I wanna go home. All's we gotta do now is find the tombstone that marks the spot where you buried us. It's almost 8 o'clock. We're gonna have to go find 'em. How, it's 15 miles out of this bottom. And remember, they have our only transportation. Where the hell could they be? Leslie probably talked Tanya into goin' into town. Probably lookin' for somethin' besides bologna to eat. What was that? What was what? That sound we just heard. Sounded like a wolf. A wolf? You mean there's wolves in these woods too? Also snakes, bobcats, alligators. That's enough, don't tell me anymore. There's a winch on the front. What's that? Something to get you unstuck with. Well why in the hell didn't you mention that before now? You didn't ask, besides, I don't know how to use it. That's stupid, we have a manual right here. Hand me the flashlight. Okay it says you keep the motor running, you pull, keep the vehicle in neutral, you pull out on the cable until. Here it is, right here. See, there's a cable right there, you just pull out on that. I figured I'd be doing all the work. Look woman, if you wanna get out of here, you'd better get down here and help me! Well I do wanna get out of here. Okay. My god, Leslie, there he is! Doc, what time is it now? Almost 11. Feel something's bad wrong. Yeah, so do I. I'll tell you what let's do, I don't think we can wait any longer. Take the rifle and we're goin' in the swamp. Is he back? No, but the girls are. Are you sure? Now you see how slow that's moving? That's them all right, get over there. Just get on the bed. We're gonna play this out. It's them all right. Just relax now, let's just watch this a second. Come in, ladies. You wanna tell me about it? I'm gonna let her. Well? We stuck the Jeep. That figures. That ain't all. Did you wreck it? No, we saw it. You saw what? I knew they wouldn't believe us. Damn it, Doc, we saw it. You and Tim saw it, we believed you, why can't you believe us? Tanya, did you see it? Yeah. It wasn't that I didn't believe them, I guess I just wanted to get back at them a little bit for what they had put Tim and I through for the last six hours. This was a day I knew we had to travel the river to Crenshaw's. I went over my notes, then put down all the new information that I had. One thing that I didn't quite understand though was Trooper Williams' last statement to me when we were at the coffee shop. Crenshaw had told him the creature was an incredible runner and an unbelievable swimmer. Anyway we got ourselves together, loaded up and headed for the Sulpfur River. Jaws! God. Tommy, get out of here! ♪ Send me roses ♪ ♪ Give me candy ♪ ♪ Tell me all those things, I love you ♪ Howdy. Howdy. You goin' huntin' or fishin'? Well, we headin' down river. Well how you travelin', you wadin' or ridin'? Well hope to be ridin', do you rent any boats? I got one, I'll rent you $5 an hour and I've got a larger boat that I'll rent you for $25 a day, everything furnished. We'll take the one for all day. Good, I'll get you one. You all go right down there and wait, and we'll bring it around. ♪ But that's okay ♪ ♪ We'll be another ♪ ♪ That it's the same old ♪ How far is it down to Crenshaw? Well according to Deputy Williams, it's about two miles down river. Dang it, we should've brought our swimsuits so we could stay for awhile. Instead of going off on this stupid safari. I hear the boat comin', let's go. You wouldn't know a fellow by the name of Crenshaw, would you? Everybody up and down this river knows Crenshaw. How far down river is it to his place? Oh, by crow flight or by boat. By boat. Well I'd say about three miles. First cabin on the right. Thank you very much, just load up. These river bottoms are truly a sight to behold. As we traveled the river that day, it made me feel good. Here, the air is clean, reminding me that much of this country is still and should remain unspoiled. With all the wildlife, moving water and vegetation, I was beginning to understand how easy it is for this creature to survive and hide from men. I'm convinced now that he is more man like than animal. Every reported sighting he's always been seen in an upright position on his back two legs. Bears, gorillas, orangutans and such other animals can walk about on two legs but under stress or strain will go down on all fours to run. Crenshaw's. Anybody home? Knock on the door, Tim, let's see if anybody answers. I don't think anybody's home. I don't like this at all. That could be a mad goat. Hey. What are y'all doin' here? You lookin' for somethin' to steal? Nope, not exactly, saw your place in the river. Thought we'd stop for a minute. Well, boy, if I everybody stopped here and saw my place on the river, all I'd be doin' is entertainin'. Run into Trooper Williams in town the other day and he suggested we stop down and see ya. Trooper Williams, how is he doin'? He's doin' fine. Doc, I think we better head back home. Come on down here, son, sit down, my bark's a whole lot worse than my bite, why don't y'all have a seat. How you young ladies? My name is Brian Lockhart, Dr. Lockhart. How you doin', cousin. Fine, this is Tanya, Leslie and Tim. Hi girls. You want some, gal? Give me some. That a girl. You married, Ma'am? That sure is a man's kind of woman. Ah, Mr. Crenshaw? Been livin' down here long? I sure have. I be at my truck back over in '46 and I ain't been no way in here 'cept the river since than. We're from the university and we're studying man. Well, boy, if you come down here and study me, you'd better be prepared to stay for awhile. No, Sir, but I would like to ask you some questions, if I could? Uh-huh. You ain't with the revenue boys, are you, son? 'Cause if you are, I'll throw down on you before nine guards couldn't go to Menna. Nope, like I said, we're from the university. Studying the Boggy Creek Creature. The Boggy Creek Creature, huh? Well I've known that all my life. He grab back over in them woods. You ever seen him? Yeah, I've seen him all the time. He's yellin' and ballin' and carryin' on. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious, they woke me up around here one mornin', bangin' and beatin' on the tub. The man can't get a bit of sleep around here for. What'd the little one look like? Well, cousin, the little one looks just like the biggin'. Yeah, I guess. Here girl, you want some of this? What's the matter, girl, you sick? I am. That's there a man's kind of woman. I'm gonna go check on Tanya. Looks like there's a storm comin' up. And a bad one too. I think we better head back down river. Tim, you wanna get the girls? It'll be dark here in a little bit. Boy, you don't wanna get on that river with a storm comin' up like this. That water draws lightning. Well I got to go tend to my fires. Are you okay? I think so. Wait, wait. I'll tell you one thing. This old man is up to something. Whatever it is, I've got a feelin' we're gonna find out somethin' we've been lookin' for and studyin' about for a long time. Those brush palettes around there. Got a lot of ash under 'em. He been burnin' that brush for days. I'm gonna go around there and I'm gonna approach the old man and try to find out what's going on. I want you guys to get on the porch and wait for me, okay? Let's go. Clearin' land? Nope. You get a storm in these trees? Nope. None of my business, is it? Nope. You can wait in the house with the girls if you want to. Doc, come here. What's he doin'? What'd you find out? Nothing yet. Except he's up to no good. So we're gonna have to spend the night here? Way the storm is and this gettin' worse, we'll be here for the night. Doc, here he comes. Okay, get over here, sit down, quick, come on. Y'all be quiet, okay. You say you're a doctor, boy? That's right. Then you must be pretty good at patchin' up folks that's all busted. Not that kind of doctor, who's hurt? I thought all of you doctors was good at doctorin' old sick folks. Let me tell you somethin', cousin. Me and you have got to have a talk. And all nice and private. I think we're overdue. You come on with me. Now cousin, I'm gonna cut you in on somethin' that's gonna get us rich. Now you got the book learnin' and the doctor power and you know how to handle this situation. I'm worried about this. Doc knows what he's doin'. What do you think they're doing in there? Now I'm gonna let you get rich with me, boy. Go ahead, I'm listening. I know how to catch that creature out there in the woods. Y'all trap it? Sort of. You come on back here, let me show you somethin'. Go ahead. Come on over here, boy. Hunk on down, I wanna show you somethin'. My god, man. How long have you had this? I caught him a few days ago with my trap. What do you think about him? I think you're crazy, that's what I think. This thing is almost dead. It's weak. That's what I got you here for, boy. I want you to patch him up. Let me tell you somethin', old man. That's why that thing's been going crazy lately. Jumpin' on people, been around our camp, followed the girls. He's after this little one. That's why you're building these fires around this camp, isn't it, 'cause it's afraid of the fire. Is it? You finally smartened up, cousin. You figured it out. We gotta get this to a doctor. Doc, what is it? Lord have mercy, I gotta get to my fires. Doc, what happened in there? I saw it. Saw what? I saw the little creature. No, no! Wait a minute. Quiet! I don't wanna see it. All right. You stay here, Leslie. Watch that old man out of here. You guys come with me. He ain't gonna make it if we don't get him to a doctor. Storm or no storm, we have to get him out of here. Doc! I heard the creature! I heard the creature. Quiet, quiet. Did you hear anything? Yeah, I heard him. Now just wait a minute, he's on the porch, be quiet. Stay in there, stay in the house. Hold it, man! Rain marked the fire, it's coming in here on us. Put the shells back in your pocket! You better let me kill him now. You're not gonna fire that gun, man. I mean it, hold it! Don't cost me this time, old man. Get in that house! Right. Get in there! Tim, Tanya, check those (Mumbles). Here, man, give me the gun. You don't know what you're doing, boy. Don't let me tell you again, old man, give me the gun! Now let's sit down in that chair and get real comfortable, okay? Stay right there, old man. Tim, hold this gun. Take this. You know how to use it. You stay here, old man. Watch him close. Come on, boy, give me that gun. Don't be as stupid as that doctor. No way. Hold it. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Not anymore. I know you don't understand but I'm gonna give you what you came for. Easy now. Give me that gun, boy. No, no! Get away from me, girl. Get away. Hold on! Well give me them shells, boy. Well boy. You right about one thing. How's that? That thing ought to be left alone. To remain free and live in the wild. Crenshaw was not telling me anything new. For the last few days, I knew this was the way it had to be. Looks like I'm gonna fall into the same category as other people have done in this area for years and years. I just felt for some special reason what I saw and what I now know I wanted to keep to myself, it wasn't really a matter of whether anyone would believe me or not. I guess you could say it was a matter of keeping him a mystery, 'cause this is where he belongs. It's like the old gentleman in the store said to me, "Boy, there ain't no monsters around here." And you know something, they were right. He's a part of nature living in harmony in one of America's last great wildernesses. That's why this legend will continue. For I feel God intended it that way.
