Not too much water It's a pity you didn't warn Janet She could have told me that cat was black and I'd have swallowed any explanation about a missing tail Look You've got to try and understand what it's like for me My world has changed it's black it's a world voices and smells I don't want to be made a fool of,Chris I didn't mean to do that I need your eyes You see what frightens me is there's no longer any difference between true and false Almost I thought that cat was Sally it was Sally if I can't be sure of you it's the end of everything You've got to promise never to lie to me again Even to please me I promise Here we are,the roses let me see if I can remember Red ones in the middle white at the end Red ones on the archway Now which shall I have?

Mrs Hammond mentioned it this morning Car's hardly been running But it cant have been - as much as that -But it was Never had a bill as big as that when I could see what was going on Are you calling me a thief Mr Hammond? Nobody is calling you anything yet ,Clem Just think you ought to watch your step Now look Mr Hammond I'm not a complete fool We both know what would happen to me if I got into trouble with the police again I'm warning you that's all I may be blind but I still want to know everything that's going on around here Maybe there others you should warn first That's enough in future I want to know everything that's done to the car and the plane,understand? -I'll see that you know,Sir -Right Richard darling it's Max -Max? -Yes He must have shortened his engagements at the club Or they cut it sort more likely Well,you don't look -very pleased to see me -Of course I am Just surprised that's all Well I thought by now you'd both be bored to death of the simple life -So here I am -Broken and unemployed I expect?

What fun See Max to his room,darling I'll ask Janet to set another place for dinner David Thank you Are we afford(?) to doing some painting while I arrived here,Christiane? Still life David Or from the figure? Thank you Janet I wonder if she's as good in the pantry as she is in the kitchen Can't you ever think of anything but sex? Can you? You'd better keep away from Janet,Max Are you afraid she might not fall for my fatal charm? I don't want to lose a good maid just to satisfy your vanity Besides Clem has already got his eye on her Clem? Now there would be an interesting item Jilted chauffeur assaults maid jaded lover David,I thought you came down here to discuss some business with Richard I did but we can leave it till the morning Oh no now would be fine -I got all the papers next door -Good Feels like we're in for a storm I'm sweating like a pig Nonsense there's no warmer than usual Got my briefcase over here First of all I've got the orders for the new equipment for your to sign Here they are Have you got a pen? I've got my own pen In sign here Strange What darling? I could have swear I smelled -Where do I sign? -Here The agents say they were quite pleased with the slogan I suggested for Apollo "Invite the sun into your home" What's the matter with it? Max is right,dull as ditch water Perhaps Max can suggest something better He's always full of ideas What about "there shall be no other lights before me" There was darkness on the face of the deep and Hammond said "let there be light" and there was light and Hammond saw the light and it was good That's enough Max Actually I'm all for you in this fight,Richard I'd like nothing better than to see you kick hell out of your competitors Is there anything I can do to help ? Well if we ever need a pianist at the works I've no doubt Richard we'll get in touch with you I don't know I could always knock you out a good TV commercial How about this Max,I think you might leave so they can get that business settled Well if you must get rid of me I think I'll run down to the village and see what's happening I already know what's happening here -Good night all -Good night max A bit tight every night running after every little tramp he meets is he never going grow up? Why shouldn't he enjoy himself while he got the chance He won't have the chance much longer if it goes on the way he is You know what the doctor said about his heart The way you talk you think we all have one foot in the grave What if you don't follow the doctors order No,Christiane bad for Richard he's tired Wide awake actually we have not done the brass touch yet All right I'll leave you to it -Good night darling -Good night-Don't stay up too late -I won't -Good night,David Good night Let's go outside David -It'll be cooler -All right Never known it so warm down here All right now then I want a full weekly report on Apollo all details you understand Difficult I hardly expected you would let me get on with her by myself Let's not go on about that again not tonight please The smell again wish I could place it Yeah I can place that all right Why do you have to suck those revolting things? Look here Richard I'm not a child I'm not your employee I'm your partner All right all right let's get on with it what else you've got to tell me I want to ask you for the last time And it is the last time I promise you to give up the Apollo You're really frightened aren't you David ? Very well I'll make you a promise I'll give you full responsibility for all decisions at the factory from now on in everything Except the Apollo Damn it there's lots of things you can do better than me Routine or established things Thank you There's a letter here and I haven't told you about More threats? Just listen to it will you and then make up your mind Pines, it's pine trees That's what I can smell, pine trees,I'm certain of it Can't you smell them David? I'm not sure You must be able to smell them too -It's hardly important -Well of course it is You know as well as I do there aren't any pine trees around here not for miles Well then I can't be pines can it? Must be just something else for the similar smell Now you mention it I believe I can smell something Don't try and humor me,David I'm mistaken that's all there is to it What did Dr Palmer say to you that day in the office? You were supposed to watch me for signs of insanity? It was a purely personal matter I told you that I didn't believe did I? Look are you ready to listen to this letter Take your idiotic letters to the lawyer What the devil you think we pay him for anyway Tell him to threaten back And for my decision I've made it can't you get it in your thick skull? I've made up my mind I know what I'm doing Very well Good Night You can tell Dr Palmer for me he's a bloody fool There is nothing that matter with me Who's there? Just going to bed,Mr Hammond,Good night,Sir Clem has he been told to watch me too Perhaps the doctors were right Maybe my mind has been affected How else could I have smelled so distinctively something that wasn't there My throat's parched Our peaches should be out Tree just here near the bottom of the steps It can't have vanished I planted it there myself With my hands can they be mistaken too? It was there I know it Oh God,don't let me go mad Please don't let me go mad Good morning Mr. Hammond Well have you come to join me? I've already eaten Don't talk to me about food it's black coffee for me this morning I think they must mix the local brew with strontium-90 You don't look too good yourself I didn't sleep too well What is it? Max Max,do you think my brain could have been damaged by the explosion? Nonsense Richard If there was anything wrong with me mentally if I was slowly going out of my mind I'd want you to tell me when and it'd be terrible not knowing You'll be well soon get back to the factory Your employees are probably dreading it already It's not as easy as I thought it would be -Tell me -All sorts of things Strange things my memory senses hearing smelling even touching things that are wrong that can't be wrong Next last night I went out to the garden -Oh God -What is it?What's wrong?Max Nothing,it's nothing I'm all right -I'll go and call the others -No,no,no it's gone now Too many late nights I suppose What were you going to tell me Richard? Well forget about it, it's you I'm worried about You need a specialist I'll get Christiane to call Dr Palmer Not for me thank you very much I wouldn't let Palmer What's wrong with Palmer don't you trust him? Well yes of course Well you know how I feel about doctors Any doctor They're ready to leave, David, Richard is coming with us -Fine -This whether I find it suffocating A drive will do you good -That's excellent,David -What is? Another painting of the house,darling It's very good Most unusual I haven't finished it yet I've had trouble with these shadows here You underestimate your talents,David The peach tree looks very real anyhow Peach tree? Yes,the tree you planted don't you remember? Yes,there are three peaches on it just right for eating I should say Purple peaches how original Richard has always been fond of peaches Richard -Are you all right? -I've got a headache I don't think I'll come after all But we don't have to go,darling You go without me I'll be all right -Are you sure? -Yes Richard would you like me to stay with you Damn it all I want to be alone What the hell do I have to do to make you understand All right Damn -Who's that? -Me I didn't hear the car come back -Where are the others? -I didn't go Not my idea of a wild outing You mean they sent you back to watch me? As a matter of fact I still don't feel too well Doesn't usually stop you from going out Actually I wanted to talk to you alone about -Money I suppose -No Go ahead and help yourself the checkbooks in the desk OK -How much do you want -100 quid will see me through Another of your so-called actress friends no doubts No debutante this time She wears blue jeans and works in a coffee bar I'm heading up in the world It's a pity you can't act your age Instead of treating every girl you meet as a challenge Will you sign the check or do we start with a lecture? Hey take it go ahead and kill yourself It's my life I'm getting rid of -Your are on my money -That's right You make it I spend it The division of labor in the Hammond family -It's not funny Max -No it's not funny But it's the way you've always wanted it isn't it? You've never taken me seriously Not for a moment When I tried to join the company you laughed in my face What you in the business you've never done an honest day's work in your life Well have you ? No maybe I haven't Maybe I've been too busy living Living for both of us While you've given yourself body and soul to the factory You mean you've been behaving like an irresponsible adolescent You call that a living And you've done your best to keep me that way No one has enjoyed hearing about it more than you I thought being blind might change you make you a human being Make you realize things that you didn't before things that really matter but you let the world make a fool of you You make a fool of me too I Maybe I'm not so blind or so foolish How much did you write on that check,Max? Was it one hundred or two or five just how much can you make a blind man pay No Richard there are times when I hate your guts -What's the matter with Max darling, -Anything wrong,Richard? Just Max wanting money again He told me he hated me What about you David And how you feel too? And don't be afraid to tell me David Max wasn't I can't hurt you you know I'm blind Richard How about your Christiane? What does it feel like to be chained to a blind man for the rest of your life? Would be better if the explosion killed me wouldn't it ? -Wouldn't it? -Stop it Richard Going to my room Christiane? Max? Who's there? Who is it? What do you want? I know you're there Are you after money? But for God's sake say something Hey puss Come on Come on puss I won't hurt you You know what they say,don't you? Only cats and blind men can see in the dark Max? Max are you there? -Oh Mr. Hammond you're up early,Sir -Clem,have you seen my brother? Yes,Sir, I think he went out,Sir Well, his bed hasn't not been slept in.Where did he go? I don't know,Sir Come in Good morning,darling, I'm at the dressing table Christiane I'm,I'm sorry about yesterday You know I didn't mean what I said don't you? I understand Just that sometimes I feel so frustrated helpless and the row I've been having with Max Where is he Chris? I must talk to him -Max? -Yes He didn't sleep in his room last night Has he got some girl down in the village? -Well? -Max is gone -Gone? Where? -Back to town Probably because of what I said to him, I don't believe it Richard You'll have to know sooner or later But please keep calm There was an incident last night Clem found Max with Janet Max and that girl? You're not really surprised are you? You know what Max is like I thought there was going to be a fight Clem wanted to call you down But I wouldn't hear of it I had quite a job to persuade him not to give notice My brother dismissed so my chauffeur can remain Max knew he was in the wrong He couldn't face seeing you so he took his things and left He must be brought back at once -It's no use Richard -David can fetch him back But darl.. David I'm in here just finishing my breakfast I want to get back to town as soon as possible Christiane has just been telling me about Max Oh I want him brought back here -Is that wise? -My own brother I wasn't even informed or consulted One way or another we thought it better you shouldn't know -You thought it better -Yes I did You can get in touch with him as soon as you get to town and ask him to come back here I have a great many things to do,Richard -You'll do as you're told -I'm not a messenger boy Very well Perhaps as a friend You'll be kind enough to ask Max to come back here Please David Since it means so much to you I'll do what I can I'll wire you when I contact him Thank you Not at all I'd better go and pack Christiane? No it's Janet,Sir -Mrs Hammond back from the village yet ? -No,Sir not yet What bell is that? Bell Sir? You can hear them it can't you? Sounds like a church bell listen No I can't hear anything,Sir Excuse me there's a telegram just come for you Read it -Now I said read it -It's from Mr. Merton,Sir Well Contacted Max What a time took him three days to do it Anything more Promise visit you next week will be, will be with you soon Regards David What's the matter Janet?

I think he's still downstairs Madam Good -You can leave now Janet Yes,Madam What Max Oh Richard I just seen a telegram from David isn't it good news I'm surprised David wasted the money sending it But but you told him to I've asked you before not to lie to me What do you mean? Max is dead Isn't he? Yes,how did you know? I found your hat felt the veil You forgot about the bells I heard it Funeral bell We meant to tell you later but I was afraid the shock might be too much for you You see How well I'm taking it no hysteria No breakdown Now tell me how did he die? Tell me There was a quarrel in the kitchen just as I told you In the middle of it Max went into a fit of coughing Far worse than anything we known before David went down to the village to get the doctor He came as fast as he could but it was too late There was nothing we could do Why wasn't I told? Please forgive us Richard we did what we thought was best If Dr Palmer had been here I'm sure he would have agreed You even send someone up to my room to make sure that I didn't get out -Yes Clem -I didn't imagine it Weren't people surprised I didn't attend the funeral? They understood Things we could have done Things we should have done I spoke to him about Palmer Doctors he said -Oh,why didn't I insist -Richard No one knew how ill he really was If it hadn't happened it would have come the next month or the month after darling There's no one now but you Clem Sir I'm going for a drive Is Mrs.Hammond coming to,Sir?

But it's my name on the cross What does it feel like to be a widow a rich widow All those papers I signed all those checks Everything made out to you isn't it?

It shouldn't be too difficult now There'll be no questions no one to know But what are you waiting for why don't kill me You fool I'll tell you why we did it To save you're living out the rest of your life in a mental home It's not true I don't believe it Dr Palmer should have told you what he told me then you'd believe me They wanted to put you away They said you might become dangerous but I wouldn't let them I love you far too much to let you spend the rest of your life in one of those places Max knew what I was doing and he agreed with me I want to take care of you myself Nobody can be feared that's what I want For your sake Of course we had to take the business over but that would have come to me anyhow as soon as You were incapable In the meantime I must have money to look after you to keep you what needed Oh if you only knew what agonies I've been through I don't think I could have gone on much longer keeping it from you Everything was so clear a minute ago Nothing matters anymore All I ask is that you trust me If only I could Tell me you too Darling Tell me that you trust me I trust you Richard Dinner's ready darling I've got a surprise for you David's here He just arrived will you come down right away? Coming They must kill me now because I know If they let me escape I could tell someone about the grave How will it come Sudden blow from behind knife Something more subtle poison Poison I found a new burgundy at Fotherskill the other day I brought some for you to try I think you'll find it's got a flavor on its own Taste it Richard I've lost my taste for wine Strange thing but color makes all the difference to taste When you can't see a thing I'll serve the hors d'ouevre What's the matter where's Janet? I gave her the night off She's gone to the cinema with Clem I think Clem too? Really darling I think we can do without them for one night Yes of course You know this is really delicious,Richard You don't know what you are missing I'll give you some mayonnaise I made it exactly the way you like it There's plenty of mustard -David -Not for me thank you -What's the matter? -Matter? Why aren't you eating? I intend to I just don't like mayonnaise that's all I think there's too much mustard even for me I have mine without mayonnaise,thank you I'm sorry darling I get you another plate -I'll get it -But Richard Don't fuss ,Christiane, I like doing things myself Anything that matters Richard? We were getting quite worried about you Thought I heard someone outside You're imagining things old man Of course I am Dr Palmer told you to expect that didn't he? One of the symptoms of my illness No need to get excited,Richard Doctors aren't infallible they may have made a mistake Perhaps they're not the only ones,David What do you mean by that? David,David you must listen to reason -Richard,David -Coming All right,Richard,we mustn't keep Christiane waiting Richard You forgot that plate I'm worried about you Richard You haven't eaten a thing Just like a woman Why did you eat too little why did you eat too much I wish I had someone to worry about me Here's your coffee -Christiane -Anything that matters? Just thinking that a man in my position Blind I'm sorry what did you say? Like ??? Christiane I'm glad I've been thinking it all over and it's a relief to me you and David feel the great weights been lifted off my back Yes I'll do it Both so,so capable Just learning to appreciate how I should be grateful to be alive the explosion could easily have killed me and what what does money matter to me As long as I'm taken care of Christiane,it hasn't been easy for you I don't think that I don't know Or appreciate You need a rest I was thinking perhaps you'd leave me with a nurse for a while to get away and see your family perhaps Do you good What do you say? I wouldn't dream of leaving you Of course she wouldn't Richard Tell me,David You're gonna settle with the group I take it you will The end of Apollo Last ambition Better drink the coffee Richard,before it gets too cold Coffee?
