Subtitles by Nostromo Betty Good Afternoon,George Hello,Blair,had a look at that property for me yet? -No,I do something about it tomorrow -Good -Oh,Mr Blair -Good Afternoon Miss Spence How very fortunate running into you like this I wonder if it would be too much to ask if you could come out to the Noude one day this week. My sister wants to change her will again So soon?Well,I'm going out to Craiglands on Friday,I could call in on the way back Good,we'll give you tea,Amy does so enjoy going over her will Yes,so I gather Oh,and do remember us to your dear aunt Lin,won't you? -Yes,of course -See you Friday then -Good Bye -Good Bye Miss Spence -Are my papers(?) ready Miss Tuff -Yes,Mr Blair,they are on your desk Good,I'm going off early I want to get up to the golf club Very good,Mr Blair What's this? Who is Miss Sharpe? One of those two women from London who came to live at the Franchise She telephoned three times What's it about,do you know? She wouldn't say,she said she wanted to speak to you personally Over to your Aunt telephoned to remind you to collect the fish for dinner on your way home You are slipping,Miss Tuff It should be biscuits today, surely,it's Wednesday -Cake tomorrow -We fell out of biscuits,Mr Blair And so is the shop Yes There is a Miss Sharpe on the line for you,Mr Blair Well,put her through,will you? Is that Mr Blair? Yes,speaking You don't know me,Mr Blair My name is Sharp,Marion Sharpe I live at the Franchise the house on the Laubury Road Yes,I know Mr Blair,I need a lawyer urgently How?What's the trouble? -Scotland Yard -Scotland Yard? Yes,I haven't murdered anyone if it's that what you are thinking but it is something quite serious I can't explain over the phone I see Well,I'm afraid I know very little about criminal law,Miss Sharpe my firm is not really equipped to deal with cases of that sort I don't want a criminal lawyer I've seen you in Melford and I like you to advise me But you would be much better off with a solicitor who is used to police cases,you know Someone Mr Blair There are people from Scotland Yard here in this house and I don't know what to do If it is something you feel you don't want to mixed up in you can always pass it on to someone else afterwards Couldn't you possibly come? Please I'll be with you in about 20 minutes I saw you coming I didn't want you to ring My mother lies down in the afternoon and I'm hoping we can get this business over before she wakes up I'm most grateful for you for coming The Law is in here -You know Inspector Hallam,of course -Yes I think so And this is Inspector Grant from London I'm glad you come I couldn't very well proceed unless Miss Sharpe had some legal support I see And what are you charging her with? We are not charging her with anything,yet I'm supposed to have kidnapped and beaten up a girl Perhaps I'd better explain explain Yes do,after all it is your story Some weeks ago a girl called Betty Kane went to spend her holiday with an aunt in a little place called Stone Hill between here and Larborough I know Stone Hill When the time came for the girl to go back to school she hadn't returned home So her guardian,a Mrs Wynn, wrote to the aunt to send her back The aunt immediately wired to say that Betty had left for home a fortnight previously The police took all the usual measures but before they could really get going the girl turned up she suddenly appeared at her home in Aylesbury late one night wearing only a dress and shoes in a state of collapse She's been badly knocked about She said that while she was waiting at the bus stop for a coach to take her home from her aunts A car pulled up with two women in it The younger one told her that she has missed the coach And asked if they could give her a lift They were going nearly into Melford where she could catch a different coach to Aylesbury By then it was beginning to rain and growing dark So the girl got in beside the old woman at the back of the car The old woman? A thin old lady like a witch with white hair and no hat Dressed in black Ha,three strange men May I present them,mother This is Mr Blair of Blair & Sons the firm who had that lovely old house by the Wool Market Need re tidying And this is Inspector Hallam of our local police You shouldn't had sat in that chair,you are far too heavy for it And this is Inspector Grant from Scotland Yard Mrs Sharpe I'll tell her Mother,the Inspector wants us to see a young girl who's waiting in a car outside She was missing from home for two weeks or more And when she turned up again she said she'd be detained by people who wanted to make a servant of her And when she refused, they locked her up and beat her And starved her How very enterprising of them It's not a joke,mother The suggestion is that she was kept a prisoner in our attic And what did we beat her with? I wouldn't know The point is the Inspector wants us to meet this girl So that she can say we are the people or not Have you any objections,Mrs Sharpe? On the contrary,Inspector,I look forward to the meeting with impatience It's not every afternoon that I lie down to rest a dull old woman and rise up a potential monster Then if you excuse me,I go and get the girl Just a moment Might I know your reason for bringing in the girl to this house? Certainly First is the reference to Melford and secondly I read you the extract from her statement From the attic I could see a high stone wall with a big iron gate in the middle of it There was a road on the other side of the wall I couldn't see the traffic because the wall was too high And I couldn't see through the gates because they had shield surveyor on the inside Inside the gate the drive went straight for the little(?) and then went round in a funny little circle to the front door The whole story is absolutely fantastic no one could hope to get a servant by kidnapping her? No normal person of course But believe me I'd come across dozen things more incredible There's no end to the extravagance of human conduct I agree but the extravagance is just as likely be in the girl's conduct After all she's the one who has been missing Also these ladies may be able to provide a perfectly good alibi for the day in question I'm afraid not,Mr Blair Our days here vary so little I've no idea what I was doing on that day and I don't suppose my mother has either Complaining about the weather most likely Is there no one else who might remember? No one We live alone We never been able to keep a maid The Franchise is so lonely -This girl,Betty, -Kane Betty Kane May we know some more about her? Why guardian and not parent for instance? She is an orphan She was evacuated as a small child and billeted on this Mrs Wynn who has a boy of her own two or three years older What happened to the girl's parents? They were both killed in the bombing Mrs Wynn are grown very fond of the child and was glad to keep her She looks on Mrs Wynn as her mother I see, what about the girl's character? A very quiet girl by all accounts she has never been in any kind of trouble either in school or out Mrs Wynn her guardian? A very sensible woman all together she's behaved admirably In all that remains is for us to take with the same admirable detachment Miss Sharpe,the girl not only describes your house she has described you and your mother accurately You must see my position Yes, I suppose I must Then if you are ready and Mr Blair has no further questions No,not at the moment Then I bring her in Do you wonder that I wanted help in a hurry,Mr Blair? No,I don't It was good that Mr Blair to come at such a short notice and so quickly Wasn't it mother? You have licence(?) well Mr Blair Why Mrs Sharpe? I imaging that defending criminal lunatics is a little out of your line I find it extremely stimulating Yes I expected that the (?)in Melford are somewhat scarce most are addicted to golf as you have gathered we had more interest in vices Yes,these are the women It's a very grave accusation,you know -You've no doubt about it? -No A remarkable liar Might I ask Miss Kane a question? Yes,she doesn't need to answer if she doesn't want to -Miss Kane? -Yes How did these ladies come to bring you into this house? While we were in the car they said I had time to come in to have a cup of something hot with them That I only had to wait in the rain if I got to Melford too soon What happened then? They brought me and gave me some coffee As soon as I drank it I began to feel very sleepy And what did we do? That when you asked me if I'd like to stay and work for you And what did you say? I said no of course And then you said I could at least come upstairs and see what a nice bedroom I'd had if I stayed I don't remember much more until I woke up,up there Now the girl has identified us what do you propose to do? Arrest us? I want to take a look upstairs So Miss Kane's description of the attic can be verified If it is I report on the case to my superior and he decides what further steps to take An admirable precaution,Inspector Now,if you excuse me, I shall go back to my interrupted rest But don't you want to be present when we verify Miss Kane's statement? Oh dear no I've not the faintest doubt Miss Kane will identify the attic Indeed I should be surprised beyond belief if she failed to do so For two people who have been in such close contact we're distressingly unacquainted I hope to know you much better before this affair is finished,Miss Kane Good Bye,Mr Blair I hope you continue to find it stimulating And now Miss Sharpe if you don't mind perhaps we could take a look at the attic Certainly The statement goes on "when I woke up it was daylight The light was coming in through a round window up near the roof I found most of my clothes had been taken so I couldn't run away They left me only a slip The younger woman came in and try to persuade me to give the maid's job a trial I asked her to give me back my clothes and let me go But she wouldn't The bed was in that corner There are castor marks there There was a bed there,we got rid of it a few days ago Why was that? We didn't need it What else was in the room,Miss Kane? You speak of a chair, a table and a wash stand It wasn't a real table,it was a sort of old fashioned trunk I used to have my supper on it That's the wash stand Can you describe the trunk? It was dark brown with a flat top,it was quite big It had like ribs round it Have you a box room,Miss Sharpe? Inspector,I'm not going to disturb my mother again this afternoon I must admit there is just such a trunk her room It is brown it has a wooden bands around it It's quite an ordinary trunk And the chair? I'm afraid I can't help you about that What kind of chair was it Miss Kane? I don't remember She took it away after I tried to break the window You can see where I hit it That was the first time she went for me How did you get away from here eventually? The old woman brought me some porridge one night and as she went out I noticed the key made a funny clicking noise in the lock I tried to worm it open I waited for a few minutes cause I thought it was another trap And then? I crept down to the landing I could hear them talking in the kitchen,so I went out the front way In your statement you said you were only wearing a slip didn't you arrive home in a dress? I forgot to say that her slip had been changed for her dress there is no heating in here in nothing but a slip she'd probably had died If she was ever here If,as you say,she was ever here And now the garage if you please One of the wheels was being lighter than the others and it didn't look as if it belonged The different wheel was in front and on my side I noticed it when they first stopped to pick me up Well,Miss Sharpe I think that's what about all for the moment Before you go,Inspector, I should like make my position absolutely clear I think I owe that to Mr Blair And I am glad that this girl is presently here what I have to say I've never to my knowledge seen her before I did not give her lift anywhere on any occasion She was not brought into the house either by me nor by my mother Nor was she kept here Is that clear? Very In other words,Inspector my clients asked you for this as a complete denial of the girl's story Quite I shall be able to get you,I suppose, should I want to talk to you further Oh,yes,Inspector,we have no intention of going anywhere You're awfully late,Robert Yes,dear Did you bring the fish? No,dear I'm sorry,Aunt Lin,I forgot But I am glad we didn't wait for it Christine is in a huff as it is, she wants to go a meeting I offered to cook the dinner myself but of course she wouldn't hear of it Can't think why,you cook just as well as she does Oh no,she doesn't,does anyone thinks that your aunt makes better than me,Mr Robert? Hot cross buns but only once a year No one makes butter tarts like you,Christine What kept you so late,dear? I rang up the golf club I had to go out to the Franchise Those people?I didn't know you knew them I didn't,they wanted some legal advice Well,I hope you get paid,dear, they haven't any money,you know So I gathered The father drank himself to death and left them without a penny Old Mrs Sharpe kept a boardinghouse in London and her daughter was made a war worker Yes,yes and they were just being turned out into the street when the old man at the Franchise died so providential He was some sort of friend of the mothers Aunt Lin,where do you get all these stories? But it's true,dear,perfectly true It's gossip I never pass on gossip,Robert,you know that Speak no evil,see no evil,there are no evil,please hurry up,Mr Roberts I'm sorry,Christine,I started later You'd be late for the last judgement,then where will you be Where indeed What's the Franchise like,dear? I always wondered what was behind those iron gates Rather gloomy they got some nice pieces of furniture then Not so well kept as ours I'll be bound Have they got a maid now? Hm,no Well I'm not surprised,they starved the last one,you know Aunt Lin But I assure you For breakfast she had the crust soft for toast and then they had a milk pudding Auntie,you really must go on repeating such things That bit about the maid is particular dangerous for them just now Why? They may have to answer a charge of kidnapping one There,what did I tell you? Oh,Robert I suppose you know what you are doing But it does seem very odd that you should be mixed up with people like that I'm not mixed up with them,I'm acting for them But Robert,this is quite out of your line The firm hasn't handled a criminal case sine your dear grandfather's time When the old squire got drunk and carried off young Polly Gratten And that was a most unpleasant business It was indeed He wasn't looking for a servant -Good Morning,Mr Blair -Good morning,Bill Good Morning,Mr Blair Your car won't be ready for another 10 minutes I'll drive it down to the office for you if you like All right,thanks Stan Do you know anything for today? Not a thing,I hadn't had a bet for weeks Ah I'm 2 £ down on a cow called BuyPromise Let me know when you do have some,won't you? Sure Nice little number that, reminds me of a Brit I knew in Egypt same kind of eyes looked as if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth -Can I borrow this? -Sure I'm finished with it -Good Morning -I say I hear your car was outside the Franchise yesterday -Yes -A police car too,I'm told Was it? -You acting for these women? -Yes Being quite a smart aren't they? This is the blessing of our legal system, Carley is people are presumed innocent until they are proved guilty But this is enough to stir up public opinion against them till they won't dare to show their faces You know there is a strong belief around here that they are witches,don't you? Just as well as witch hunting is no longer popular then,isn't it? Don't you believe it give half these people a chance and they'll witch hunt for the best Really Then I'll be seeing you Says she was kidnapped two Melford women questioned I suppose we should consider ourselves lucky as they didn't publish our photographs or at least our names Shouldn't congratulate yourselves about that too much From what I hear people have already put two and two together And now they are saying the police is failing to their duty and not arresting us of course If the girl was never here How could she have known about this house? She did know quite a bit I just can't explain it Even the gates are never left open And certainly couldn't see over the wall The whole thing is extraordinary I think all our effort have to be devoted proving not that the girl wasn't here at the Franchise during those weeks but she was somewhere else What can we do in way of private investigation I expect you realize we've very little money To begin with I'm going myself to see the various people involved To find out,if possible,on what lines any inquiry should be based Extraordinary kind Mr Blair I hope you won't regret it You've been here about a couple of years,haven't you? Yes,I am afraid we are still looked upon us as foreigners in Melford I suppose we've kept ourselves to ourselves a little too much But we've enjoyed the privacy of this house It's so wonderful having a home of our own Mother and I have always lived in boardinghouses My father was one of those optimist who was always going to do(?) it tomorrow He died without a penny What did you do? I wasn't trained for a profession so my life has been spent in odd jobs You know,helping those gentile businesses,tea shops,flowers bric-a-brac,lampshades Old Mr Crowe who left us this house was my father's cousin I remember the old chap well It's good of you to show confidence in us,Mr Blair when are you then start your investigations? Today I begin with this Mrs Wynn,the girl's guardian Excuse me Hello Is this the Franchise? Yes You and your old mother better clear out quick,if you don't we'll... What's the matter? Some woman,she sounded crazy something about whips,she'd say they'd whip us out of town and all this caused by a slip of a girl Where was she during those weeks? I'm glad someone took it over I hope I meet them someday I'd like to shake them by the hand Mr Blair,if they did take this to court and did get a verdict,what would that mean for us? I'm not sure whether it would be 2 years imprisonment or 7 there I told you I was a broken reed where criminal procedures was concerned I'll have to look it up Yes,do there's quite a difference You are under no obligation to talk to me,Mrs Wynn but I very much hope that you won't refuse I won't keep you a moment We have nothing to hide Is Betty in? No,she's gone to the pictures with Leslis,my son I was rather surprised that newspaper getting hold of this story I should have thought you'd been very much against that kind of publicity I am,I was very annoyed about it I'm afraid it was Leslis's doing he was so furious of the police not making an arrest That was foolish thing for him to have done,of course but the trouble is he's always been so devoted to Betty Is this Leslis with her here? Yes One time they were quite inseparable Aren't they now then? Well,Leslis did get rather interested in the girl down the road for a while ago You know what boys of 19 are How did Betty liked that? Well I expect she missed not coming first in for a time She wasn't jealous? I don't think so She's a nice girl,Mr Blair So I understand I've always wanted a daughter and Betty filled that gap She was terribly knocked about you know Did she have anything in her pockets when she came home,Mrs Wynn? She only had one pocket,one in her dress Was there anything in it? Just a lipstick A lipstick? She's a bit young for that,isn't she? My dearest,Mr Blair they start experimenting with lipsticks now at the age of 10 As a wet days amusement it's taken the place of dressing up in mother's things Very probably When she first told you her story, did she tell it in all in one piece? Oh,no it was spread over a day or two The outline first And then filling in the details as she remembered them Things like the window in the attic being round Should have thought her days of coma would blur her memory Not with Betty,she's got a remarkable memory Even as a child she could look at the picture in a book just one instant and then tell you everything there was in it What you might call a photographic memory Yes I suppose you would call it that Well,thank you,Mrs Wynn,I am very grateful to you for seeing me Mummy,Leslis been... Good Afternoon Good Afternoon This is Leslis Your mother and I was just been saying what a pity it was that you gave that story to the newspaper Nobody is going to ill treat Betty and get away with it Mrs Wynn if it ever should occur to you that something in Betty's story doesn't quite ring true I hope you won't decide to let sleeping dogs lie Don't pin your faith on that,Mr Blair You mean you would? No No I mean the hope of my doubting Betty's story If I believed her in the beginning I'm not likely to change my mind One never knows I suppose they still will have to have a lawyer as anyone else But hardly expect me to have any sympathy for them -After all I am Betty's aunt,Mr Blain -The name is Blair,Mrs Jarrett Oh,yes of course How did Betty pass her time when she was staying with you,Mrs Jarrett? Oh,she went to Larborough most days Alone? Oh,she was on here on holiday,wasn't she? Poor thing after all that school work What good all that book learning does for a young girl like that I really don't know Mrs Hallop's daughter she could hardly write her name and she married a man.. How did she spend her time in Larborough Betty I mean At the pictures mostly You can do that from morning till night in Larborough if you are given that way And that was Betty did? Well,only the mornings I think She's sensible Betty is It's simpler(?)if you ban before 12 you know So she didn't come back here to lunch? No,she had a coffee lunch somewhere in Larborough we have our main meal at night,you know It's always been my priority to have a good nourishing 6 o'clock meal What was she doing in the afternoons? Bus driving mostly Would you care for one of those biscuits, Mr Blain,they are fresh from the tin? No thank you Bus driving,where? Oh anyway the fancy took her Did she go to Melford on the bus,do you know Mrs Jarrett? They asked me that,of course, but I couldn't say yes or no -They? -The police Oh,yes of course Well,I mustn't waste your time any longer You are not the police,I think you said No,of course you are a lawyer,you told me I do hope I told you all the things you wanted to know,Mr Blain You've been very helpful,Mrs Parrett -Rob my dear fellow -Kenneth How are you? Sorry to keep you waiting The case took longer than I expected but as you see I dashed straight over from courts I thought you dressed up like that to impress me Did you? That's look good I think I have a scent(?) Ah,how are you,Kevin,Mrs Chattle told me you were busy Oh,up to my eyes in it I'm dining out tonight and catching a late train got a case of (?) tomorrow I didn't ask you rob all business I never see you otherwise Kevin,I want some friendly advice What's the trouble? Scotland Yard Good heavens you must be slipping what Scotland Yard got to do with Blair & Sons They are on the doorstep and I don't know how to deal with them Come and tell you about all that by that(?) The Yard I take it trying to find corroborative evidence to back up Betty Kane's story Got it If I were them I'd risk an arrest They got a good enough case Do you mean you believe her story? I never believe anyone's story What's you want to know do I find the girl's story believable Of course I do But Kevin if you met these two women you'll say it was absurd Not at all,women who live lonely lives sometimes do extraordinary things Only the other day an elderly woman who was found to kept her sister chained to a bed in a room no bigger than a cupboard for three years Feed her on potato peelings and scrapped it ,didn't want it herself What on earth for? Said her money was going away too fast and that was her way of making ends meet She had quite a good bank balance actually Now there is much more absurd and unbelievable stories I'm glad you are not representing Betty Kane my clients would be behind bars already Mind you I could just as well to present the case from the opposite angle Kevin,you are infuriating,you just said that you find the girl's story believable So I do I could also find it believable if it is a tissue of lies I could make a case for either side On the whole though I should prefer to be Counsel for Betty Kane It must be a tissue of lies I'm quite sure that neither of these two women could possibly do such a thing What does she look like? -Who? -Betty Kane Now you caught,the one you're interested in,this Marion Sharpe Kevin McDermott? Yes,he's an old friend of mine I just wanted to get an unbiased opinion on the situation And was he helpful?? Not really Have you heard anything further from Grant? No we hadn't heard from the police We had some more unpleasant telephone calls We stopped answering -That newspaper -Yes A titbit like this apparently must be a gift to them It will slack off it's just a tide Meanwhile We have to deal with what's left on the beach A particularly horrid beach Anonymous letters? Yes,I must say they show a very vivid imagination And when they arrive at out of words ,they draw.. Listen Hallam, you must give them some sort of protection,you know I might send them men out a couple of times a day,to show the uniform so to speak That'll be something Well,all right -I'll do that -Thank you Hallam I think you'd better come and padlock the gate,Miss Sharpe I can't imagine what it would be like without you to help us Good Afternoon could I speak to someone who would know about the Larborough to Melford bus service? Timetable on the wall outside But I don't want about times I want to know if you ever run a double decker bus on that route No Never? Look I am a solicitor There are no double decker buses on the Melford run What do you want? Could I have those spares for Norton (See you out on your way) I couldn't contradict him straight out, not in the mode he is in now but he's wrong about them double decker buses,you know? Once or twice this year we had to use them when one of the single decker broke down Would it be possible to find out exactly when the double decker was used on that route? Sure,in this firm it is recorded every time you spit Come on I look it up The double decker bus passed the Franchise on two occasions during the time that Betty Kane was staying with her aunt with her aunt And from the top of the bus she could have seen over the wall She could have seen the round attic window,the circular drive and the two women probably getting into this car with the odd wheel You're taking rather lot for granted,aren't you? Even if she was on one of these buses and saw such a picture as you suggest She could never taken it in all in the time Ah,she's got a photographic memory I learnt that from her guardian This is all pure supposition,Blair Still doesn't explain how the girl was able to describe the inside of the house,the attic I realize that but surely this is a supposition you people should look into We are not interested in suppositions when we got facts to go on You believe her story,don't you Hallam? Yes She is a genuine and nice kid I should say,might have been one of my own We checked her story and it checks And one single piece of evidence to back it up,we shall make an arrest Evening,Mr Blair -What is it whitewash? -No,Sir Good quality paint takes some going off Inspector send me out to have a look round and there it was Some people never go out of it Out of what? Writing things on walls Does the Sharpes know about this? I told them and I went in to phone the Srgt Are you going to hang on here? Srgt said to stay until dark There really should be someone here all night you know We haven't a man for spare for that,Sir What do you think of our wall decoration? It has to go to someone to clean it out I've tried,I've been on the phone for at least half an hour Every one say they are busy all of a sudden Who have you tried? I've tried them all,no one can do anything tonight And tomorrow morning it seems all their men going out early on important jobs -It's like that,is it? -Yes And I'll see what I can do I find out something interesting in Larborough today At least I think its interesting I know now how the girl could have seen quite a lot Everything in fact except the inside of the attic -How? -Over the wall Double decker buses run past here recently on two occasions I'm glad about this Glad because,quite apart from everything else It'll help to remove any doubt That might just Muddled my crystal mind? Yes My mind is quite clear Thank you You know,Bill,when the army gave me that free toy,Billy I got a phobia I took a great dislike to slogans on walls That's funny,so did I Not bad Not bad at all considering I told you not to worry,Mr Blair,Inspector I thought Mr Blair ought to know about it Of course I got a wallop with a bottle Well,Mr Blair,are you still find it stimulating? You plan to stay on here,Mrs Sharpe? Certainly You mustn't do that I'll find you a quiet hotel in Larborough I've never heard of anything so absurd, of course we're going to stay What will a few broken windows matter? It may not stop at broken windows No And you are a great responsibility to us as long as you are here A responsibility we really haven't got the force to deal with I'm sorry to for your nuisance,you Inspector but this is our home and here we are going to stay Quite apart from the questions of ethics how much of our home will there be to come back to if we left it empty? I take it that if you are too short of men to guard human beings you certainly haven't got enough men to guard empty property Well,there is that Miss Sharpe And that I think poses a question our leaving the Franchise -Sugar -Yes,please,Madam -Mrs Sharpe -Now look What you want is a lodger What do you say if I move in and sleep here starting tonight No meals,just a sleeping night watchman,they all sleep anyway -Haven't you got a wife? -No,I'm married to a dog thus so far What about your landlady? Oughtn't we to let her know? I can slip a note under the door She won't be worried about him anyway,he's been out nights before And Delivering cars to customers You can do it half a time at midnight Well,if you are going to be our guest I'll go and get your room ready I suspect your head feels like a very painful turnips Can I give you a hand? Yes as a matter of fact you can I shall never forget what you two have done for us When I think of tonight, it won't be those louts I remember But you two What about your business Mr... -Peters -No sugar,thanks My business? Well,I meant if your customers find you become a night watchman at the Franchise they take their custom elsewhere Well,there's nowhere else to take it? Lynch is drunk five nights of seven and old Biggins couldn't put a chain on a bicycle I wonder You wonder what? Suppose you went around to Scotland Yard and told them what you found out about the buses It doesn't prove anything Hallam was very clear on that point Yes,but surely they should investigate it? After all the police are supposed to be department of justice Department of law,justice begins in court You had a bad day here,haven't you? Yes Even worse than the wall and the anonymous letters came We decided in future to burn everything before we open it It's the best thing to do It was nice of you to get Stan and Bill to clean the wall for us I do thank you for that Yes,they are good chaps I'll see what I can do about the windows in the morning I'm afraid this horrible affair is taken up a great deal of your time It's become a personal matter with me Personal? The one ambition of my life is to discredit Miss Betty Kane Oh,I see A number of people gathered last night outside a house in the Melford district Two men working on the premises came to blows with the demonstrators and in a serious scuffle windows were broken it is understood that the occupants of the house remained discreetly out of sight until the last of the demonstrators had dispersed Marion Get the car out Charlie,when old Beyer comes in ask him to come over to my office,will you, I want him to do a job for me put some windows in Right,Mr Blair I'll tell him What about the row at the Franchise last night I see I told you these people would make it hot for them If I were you I'd advise them to go away from here sell the house and settle down somewhere else They would never do it and I never advised them to You can't go through life with a tin can tied to the tail and pretending it is not there Matter of principles You can pay a too high price for your principles Good Morning Miss Truelove I'm afraid all the tables are reserved Indeed,very well,then we'll wait The tables are booked all morning We will wait Good Morning Mr Blair We just flew in on our broomsticks for a cup of hot blood May I have a table for three,please,Miss Truelove I'm sorry Mr Blair all the tables are booked I'm sure you'll understand I must study the feelings of my customers Fiddle-dee-doo,we intend to have a cup of coffee Don't look so worried it's only a gesture You are merely providing these people with a free spectacle They must get used to it If they see a giraffe once a year it remains a spectacle If they see it every day it becomes part of the scenery Well, we propose to become part of the Melford scenery All right become part of the scenery but come out of this place now and have your coffee with me at the Rose and Crown Mr Blair,that would be delightful but it wouldn't relieve my spiritual indigestion As a personal obligation to me as your lawyer That is blackmail It's an answer anyhow Seems we are going to have coffee at the Rose and Crown Good Oh,Mr Blair this must be dreadful for you Do you think you(?) I couldn't care less Let's make something stronger than coffee Yes Inspector Hallam is on line for you Mr Blair Put him through,will you? -Is that you Blair? -Yes,speaking I feel I have got bad news for you Grant's here,he came to apply for a warrant to arrest the Sharpes That's not possible You'd better come over and have a word with him Right This news is a great shock tor me,Inspector I expect it is,Mr Blair We found some new evidence What we think is conclusive evidence -Might I know what it is? -Certainly A girl has come forward prepared to swear she heard scream coming from Franchise attic During the time Betty came and claimed to be detained there -Who is this girl? -Her name is Rose Glynn She works at the farm near the Franchise And apparently used to go there, now and again,to clean the place But why a warrant to arrest, my clients aren't going to run away The girl was missing for over 2 weeks She was very badly knocked about Deliberately It's not a case to betaking lightly When do you want them to appear in court? On Monday Then I suggest you serve then a summons to appear on Monday My superiors have suggested an arrest Your superiors have no knowledge of local conditions If the Franchise is left without occupants it will be a wreck in no time There's a lot in what Mr Blair says The feeling here is very strong against these two women Very well,then We'll make it a summons I'll get that signed If we avoid a remand on Monday,Mr Blair The case can go straight to be decided Can you be ready with your defence by Monday,you think? With all the defence my clients have we could be ready by tea time You know,I think your clients are luckier than they deserve in their solicitor I can only hope they are less luckier in our counsel Otherwise I may find myself being talked into voting them in testimony(?) Robert -Good Evening,Inspector -Good Evening,Miss Sharpe I'd like to speak to you and your mother for a moment I'm afraid my mother is resting Well,perhaps you'd ask her to come down It's important I don't believe it You mean you are charging us for this thing You mean we have to appear in public court to be accused of a thing like this I'm afraid there's no alternative But I think I ought to tell you in case he doesn't, but from Mr Blair here, you'll both be sleeping tonight in a cell Don't bother Miss Sharpe, I'll let myself out Is that true? Yes And what is this evidence? You used to have a girl who came in occasionally to help you clean the house,didn't you? Yes,Rose Glynn,we had to get rid of her Get rid of her? Why? Stealing,she stole a watch of Marion's We'd overlook taken an odd shilling or two from a purse, we needed to help but when it came to the watch that was too much We asked her about it,of course she hadn't seen it so we told her we wouldn't be needing her anymore I see,and how did she take that She went very pink She went red as a beetroot and bridled like a perky dog Why do you ask? Because she would say on oath that she heard screams coming from your attic Will she indeed? That was known as a bit of a face up Yes,definitely A face up of you too Your faced with the possibility that we've been lying Really,Marion If I'm faced with anything it is the choice with your words and Rose Glynn's I wish,oh,how I wish that we had one small,just one small piece of evidence on our side She gets away with everything that Kane girl,everything We keep on saying it isn't true but we have no way showing it isn't true It's all inconclusive Or negative or feeble denial Things can bind back her lies but nothing happen to help prove that we're telling the truth Nothing Sit down,Marianne, a tantrum won't improve the situation I could kill that girl,I could kill her When I think what she has done to us We'll get everything straightened out eventually How? I don't know how but we will Is that natural optimism, Mr Blair or belief in the triumph for good? Or what? I think truth has its own validity (?) didn't find it very valid nor ask us later They did it in the end Frankly I don't look forward appear in prison waiting for truth to demonstrate its validity So you see,Kevin,something must be done quickly,we are in a frightful jam That's schoolboy's description but extremely accurate Kevin,couldn't you come for the weekend and let me talk to you about it? Aunt Lin was saying yesterday it was six years since you spend a night with us so you're overdue anyhow Well,look would Christine lead with some butter tart? Yes,I guarantee it It's a deal.I say Rob Have you considered the possibility that the police have the right of it? You mean the girl's story may be true? Are you keeping that in mind? As a possibility I mean No I am not -All right Good Bye -Good Bye Hello,dear,look what I managed to get for you today,Dollymore What on earth did I ever need stomach powder? Well,you never know,dear,you might, you haven't been looking at all well lately And Mr Dollymore said Robert,you put the fish down on the table and it's so (?)into mahogany And Christine will be waiting for me Which are you charging me with? The mahogany or keeping Christine waiting? What I don't know what's come over you lately I'm sorry,Auntie,I am a bit on edge these days It's not very pleasant for anyone in the town to see the notoriety that's overtaking it It's always have been such a quiet thing and fine little place I don't like Melford as much as I did so I save my tears It's all very difficult for me For you? Yes,now that you are representing these people I can't talk about it to anyone It's quite maddening,dear Like wanting to be sick and having to postpone it Only this morning at the Anne Boleyn Miss Truelove was condoling with me and now being mixed up in it What she did? Well I condole with Miss Truelove's sister Condole with her? Of what? For having a sister like Miss Truelove So you're best, given the police court tomorrow and then get it assigned to Larborough Just what do you mean by given the police court? Well,you've got no evidence on your side there will be a fight of it So let them parade their evidence and as you are there the defence supply for bail It should be a very formal affair, so I am assured of When are the assizes? On the 14th Sure the Handicap day Are you interested in racing? I am Who do you think is going to win Handicap? Favorite? Not on your life None of them (?) are any good when it comes struggle they just turn it up Well,what shall I bet then? Nothing My brother Charles always used to say when he was at Leithways Horse-sense is the instinct that keep horses from betting on men Leithways? You are not Charles sister(?)are you? I am Did you know Charles? The penny I ever had on my own was bet by Charles(?) What's Charles doing now? Didn't he go to Canada or somewhere? Yes,Montreal He wrote to us some time back asking us to go and keep house for him But at that time we had inherited this place So we said we wouldn't I'm beginning to wish now we had -Good Morning Mr Blair -Good Morning Stan -Want your car? -Yes, I'm going into Larborough -Good Morning,Bill -How are things,Mr Blair? Fierce My Missus went to the police court Said she wouldn't believe that Betty Kane even if she told her there were 12 p in a shilling No matter what that Rose Lynn might say Why not? Much too good to be true she said she was Oh no she was never came in here I should have remembered her if she had Fancy treating a poor thing like that How do you know they did? Oh it says so in the paper The paper only reports what the girl said But they wouldn't put a thing like that in the paper if it wasn't true Beside what the other girl said You're a detective? Part time How much do you get an hour? Not really enough Haven't got a union I suppose Poor,luv,what an experience for her -Such a nice face too -Poor luv Those (?) has to be picked up that's all she get,(??)we say Thank you BTW have you ever seen her? Light ale -How do you do,Sir? -Hello,Albert Strange case that so reading about that girl Yes,suppose you've never seen her in here Not that I remember She looks a bit young for this place,Sir Half a bitter Half a bitter You know when I come to think of it,I'm not so sure She wouldn't look so young with a hat on,would she? No,that's true Yes,of course That's the girl in the green hat You mean she did come in here for coffee? No for tea For tea? Yes,of course that's the girl Fancy me not recognizing her Albert Are you absolutely sure of this? Yes I remember I noticed her she always came in alone First I thought she was waiting for relations That's the sort of girl she looked Nice and neat clothes and no airs You could have knocked me down with a feather when she picked up that man You mean the man picked her up surely? Don't you believe it,he hadn't even thought of it when he sat down She didn't look that sort You'd have thought that butter wouldn't melt in her mouth Goodness And to think I never recognized without the hat What was the man like,did you know him? He was not one of my regulars Young,darkish with a moustache Commercial type I would say Did she ever come back? I don't remember seeing either of them again,Sir Would you the know the man if you saw him? Not to swear to it,Sir We get a good many of that sort in here You planning any swearing to,Sir? We'll talk about that,Albert, when we found him So to start with,Mr Ramsden,I want you to try and find this man she picked up He might be able to give me just the information I need Albert,the lounge waiter, knows what he looks like I think I get over in Larborough now Oh,I have a better photograph of the girl tomorrow but perhaps you could lend me your newspaper the one for today Certainly How are you going to get another photograph of her? Oh,ways -Good day,Mr Blair -Good day And now,Mr Ramsden,what luck? I've got to tell you Mr Blair you're throwing good money away, it isn't a business proposition for you Is it as hopeless as that? We can never hope to trace the man except through the girl and we'll never find about the girl because their photograph is quite useless How do you mean? I mean when she left her aunts when she disappeared She must have ordered her appearance so that she couldn't be recognized For instance with her hair swept up and some make up and possibly a hat she'd look quite different That's why I don't want waste any more of your money,Mr Blair That means we are sunk I'm sorry,Marion It certainly wasn't worth you making another appearance in Melford just to hear this It isn't your fault, I was determined to come -I'll drive you back -Thank you It's infuriating to think that girl getting away with it At least you got something to shake confidence in her This business picking up a man in Larborough I can't prove it Marion even if I could it doesn't touch her story about you having kidnapped her That's what we got to disprove There is still time About all there is time for, I'm afraid,is a miracle You are just tired,Robert It's become a personal matter,Marion I remember you said that once before I know But this time I mean it rather differently I mean I want you to marry me,Marion Do you,Robert? You will,won't you? No,I won't Why not? Well,because just because as children say Because of what? For one thing,there's my mother and another Yes,you're so spoiled by your aunt Oh yes you are You'll miss all this preacher comforts and pampering that I wouldn't know how to give you And wouldn't give you,if I knew how Marion,that's one reason that I want you marry me The fact is that you've got your head outlined and wouldn't pamper me Head out,mind you see,a nice (?) to dinner with once a week It's those sort of substitute for good pastry and an uncritical atmosphere I'm a very bad cook Really,if you haven't got any better reason than that There is another thing,Robert I don't think I would be much an asset to Blair & Sons I'm not asking you to marry,Blair & Sons If we are ever cleared of this charge against us It wouldn't free me for being the woman in the Franchise Affair An unfortunate sort of wife for a country solicitor It wouldn't do you any good,Robert,believe me I'm not taking that answer as final you know You evidently don't realize what misstep you got that You don't really mean that you are going to lose the case,do you? -I most certainly do -Robert It's customary to have a case put to the jury We have no case But you have Kevin I know we have Kevin and things even if we have At least you make a fight of it But even he should have some evidence on his side And here's none,no prospect of any Why do you kept all this to yourself,dear Was it because you thought I shouldn't understand or agree or something I was rather under impression that you believed Betty Kane's story Oh,no not after the police court The court? But you weren't there No,but Colonel Whittaker was He didn't like that Betty Kane at all Didn't he? No,he says he once had what are you to call it,Lance Corporal in his regiment who was exactly like her He ended up in the green house,Colonel Whittaker said The glass house Of course,dear,if I known that you were doubtful about the case I should have said prayers about it ages ago I was going to the Gleason's garden party tomorrow afternoon I shall go to St Michaels instead and spend a quiet hour there The wireless said it would probably rain anyway Thank you,darling I don't deny that we need your prayers But I'm afraid in this case I haven't very much hope Ah,that's rather just it,Robert, you haven't enough faith It distinctly says that faith will move mountains Of course it requires a tremendous amount of faith And that's why mountains are very rarely moved I don't believe that an angel is going to appear with an account what Betty Kane did during those weeks,if it's that what you mean No,the trouble about you,Robert dear you think of an angel as a creature with wings well it's probably it's a scruffy little man in a bowler hat If you told me that yesterday I might have believed you How do you want this wreck About an hour A year wouldn't do I'll do what I can in an hour Stan,Stan leave it will you,drive me in your van to Melford,I must see Mr Blair Sure Hey,what's that,I have seen anyone look like that since my sister Bula married a GI Come on There's a lady waiting to see you,Mr Blair What does she want? She didn't say,she just said she wanted to see you -Well,you'd better send her in -Yes,Mr Blair Mr Blair will see you now Thank you This way,please Miss Tuff,get Mr McDermott on the phone immediately,it's important Yes,Sir And when you done that ring up my Aunt Lin tell her she was wrong about her angel he's not a scruffy little man in a bowler hat,he is a woman Yes,Mr Blair Quiet Call Betty Kane Betty Kane Betty Kane Hold the Testament in the right hand and read this from the card I swear by All Mighty God that the evidence I give should be the truth,the whole truth and nothing but the truth So you are saying,you were locked in that attic without food for days on end? Yes And can you identify the two women who kept you prisoner and ill treated you? Yes Those two The accused? Yes Now Miss Kane You just told the court that it was dark when you arrived at the Franchise Was it really so dark? Yes,quite dark Too dark to see the outside of the house? Yes,much too dark I see Then In the night you escaped,perhaps that was not quite so dark? Yes,it was even darker So you never saw the front of the house by daylight? No,never Never,well that's definitely enough Let's see what you say in your statement to the police You said The drive run straight for the little and then went round in a funny little circle to the front door How did you know it like that? I could see it From where? From the window in the attic But from the window in the attic it's possible to see only the straight part of the drive The edge of the roof cuts off the rift(?) How did you know about the funny little circle I saw it,I saw it from the window Really So what you want us to understand is that you see on a different principle from ordinary human beings on the principle of the Irishman's gun that shoots round corners Or is it all done by mirrors It's the way I described Certainly it's the way you described but what you described is the view of some one looking over the wall say from the top of a double-decker bus not by someone looking at it from the window in the attic Are you proposing to call a witness as for the view of this window? Two,My Lord One with normal vision should be sufficient Thank you Miss Kane Miss Kane,you arrived at the Franchise by car Yes Now,if it was dark,as you say may we take there were lights on the car illuminating the drive? Yes,headlights And could you see the carriageway and courtyard? Yes,of course I must have seen the circle then I knew I'd seen it,I knew it Thank you,Miss Kane Call,Rose Glynn Rose Glynn Rose Glynn Hold the Testament in the right hand and read this from the card So you were just getting ready to leave when you heard screams coming from upstairs That's right And what did you do? I run to the foot of the stairs but just as I was going up Mrs Sharpe came out of the drawing room and stopped me Was the screaming still going on No,it had stopped by then I see And then what happened? Well,just then Miss Sharpe came down the stairs and went into the drawing room And the old lady followed her Then I heard the old lady say something about "ought to be more careful" What did you do then? I run home I was frightened Did you go back to the Franchise again? Oh no I wouldn't have gone back anyway but they came to the farm next day with my money said they wouldn't be needing me any more Thank you,Miss Kane Mr McDermott,do you wish to cross examine this witness? Yes,My Lord Now Rose I am going to suggest to you that you did not want to come here today and give evidence against these two people No,I didn't But you came Yes Why? Was it because someone forced you to come? Someone who held something over your head? Someone who said you say what I tell you to say or I tell about you You don't answer,well I'm going suggest you what really happened And you tell me whether I'm right Someone stole something from the Franchise Shall we say a watch And later sold it to another girl a girl she got to know here in Larborough at a cinema or café or some such place Now I suggest that soon afterwards The girl who bought the watch Found out that it had been stolen And threatened to tell the police unless the stealer of the watch promised to back up an untrue story that it was to be told in court I suggest that because of these threats the stealer of the watch did actually come into court and did in fact back up her friend's untrue story I suggest you Rose that it was really happened No,I never had that watch Would I be wrong in suggesting that you are a friend of Betty Kane? No,I don't know her So she couldn't have learned about the inside of the Franchise? What the attic was like?What was in it for instance? From you No,I don't know her Very well,Rose,thank you My learned friend has suggested that pressure was brought on you to come here Is there any truth in that suggestion? No What you said in the witness box at the police court and what you have said today is the truth? Yes Thank you Miss Glynn That's all That is the case for prosecution,My Lord My first witness,My Lord and the members of the jury,is Mr Bernard Chadwick Call Bernard Chadwick Bernard Chadwick Bernard Chadwick Mr Chadwick You are I believe,a traveller for the firm of Bren Haberden Company of London? Yes And you live with your wife in Ealing? That's right Did you in March of this year come to Larborough on business? Yes And while you were here Did you meet a girl? Yes What was her name? Betty Kane Do you see her in court? Yes,over there And how did you come to meet her? She picked me up Will you please confine yourself to standard English in your replies Mr Chadwick? Surely,My Lord And how did this acquaintance between you and Betty Kane develop? After that she used to come out with me on my business trips -Alone? -Yes She did have a girlfriend she used to go to the cinema with but she always got rid of her before she met me Did Betty Kane ever mentioned to you the name of this girlfriend? Yes,some kid called Rose something or other Did these meetings between you and Betty Kane continued the whole time when you were in Larborough? Yes And what happened when the time came for you to leave? I was prepared to pack it up but she wasn't She said she wasn't expected home and else for some time but she could easily tell her aunt that's where she was going And what was your reply? I wasn't too keen on the idea I knew she was 19 but She told you she was 19? She had her 19th Birthday in Larborough Cost me a lipstick So? After a lot of rag showing Of what? A lot of discussion,My Lord Go on but do confine yourself to English standard or basic After a lot of talk I decided it was no particular harm in her staying at my bungalow on the river near Borne End It was only used occasionally at week ends Where you there with her? I was away on business most of the time And then? I had a bit of a shock After she'd been there some days she told me she actually been due back home for her aunt several weeks previously Did she said why she misled you? Yes,so it would be impossible for her to go back She had no compunction about the suffering she would cause people who were devoted to her No,she didn't seem to have much time for her home Have you any idea why she was unhappy at home? From what she said and other things she was upset over some boyfriend who'd found himself another girl And that didn't suit Betty Kane? No You'd say she was the type who just had to be the centre of attraction? Yes Where you worried about her? Not particularly by that time I'd learned she was very well able to take car of herself And what exactly do you mean by that? I mean whoever was going to suffer it wouldn't be Betty Kane And how did the situation at Borne End disintegrate? I went down one night and found she'd gone Thank you Mr Chadwick Mr Chadwick, this is a very belated story isn't it? This case has been a matter of press reports and public comment for weeks why didn't you go to the police and tell them your story? Because I've been abroad for my firm I knew nothing about the case until a few days ago I see You heard something of the state in which this girl arrived home where you responsible for that? No Thank you Mr Chadwick Call Mary Francis Chadwick Mary Francis Chadwick Mary Francis Chadwick When did you first suspect that your husband had developed an interest elsewhere? A girl friend of mine told me he had a guest at our bungalow on the river And what did you do? I went down there Would you please tell the jury,in your own words,exactly what happened? Well,door was unlocked so I walked straight into the hall A woman's voice from the sitting room called out "Is that you Bernard?" So I went in and found her as large as life on the sofa in a kind of negligée you used to see in the films about 10 years ago she looked like nothing,I know Please confine yourself to essentials,Mrs Chadwick I'm sorry,My Lord I pulled her off the sofa and gave her a smack in the face From then on it was just a fight Then who got the better of the exchange? I did I was in a flaming temper I told that silly... And anyway you got the better of her? Yes She tripped over one of her shoes and went falling I waited for her to get up but she didn't I thought she'd passed out so I went into the bathroom and washed my face tidied my hair and did me up a bit Leaving the girl unconscious on the floor? So I thought but when I came back I found the faint had been an act,the little girl had gone And what did you do? I slung all her things into the cabin and cleared off A couple of days later,the day before my husband went abroad,I told him what I done And what was his reaction? He said it was a pity her mother hadn't done the same thing years ago Tell me,Mrs Chadwick,why did you take so long to come forward with this story? Because when my husband went abroad I went with him I thought it advisable Quite Mrs Chadwick Do you recognize anyone in that photograph? It's a photograph taken by a street photographer in Bourne End,My Lord I shall call him,if necessary Yes,it is my husband and the girl I found in our bungalow,Betty Kane My Lord The jury wish me to say something Yes,what is it? The jury wish me to say that we already have enough evidence on which to arrive at a verdict Looks as though our two young perjurers are foiled,a very pleasing thought Now,Marion,perhaps Robert Look at that poor Yes,it was quite an adventure at my age Does Robert know that you are going away? No,I haven't had a chance to tell him yet Come on let's celebrate the victory Going away? Yes,we are going to Canada to join my uncle Mother feels now she'd like to go I see "My very dear Robert This is the hasty farewell note just to let you know that we are both thinking of you We leave on a morning plane to Montreal the day after tomorrow Now that the moment is almost here we've discovered that what we both remember are the good and lovely things and the rest fade to comparative insignificance This maybe only knocked out you in advance I don't know I only know that that we always be happiness to remember you And Stanley and Bill Our united love to you And our gratitude Marion Excuse me,Sir Miss Spence called while you were out Her sister wants to change her will again She She said could they expect you about teatime tomorrow? No alteration(?),thank you You need a good holiday,Mr Blair? I could easily look after things here for a couple of months,you know Thank you Anthony I'm sure you could -Yes -Robert Yes Aunt Lin About the fish,dear,I forgot to tell you Try and get plaice will you that turbot you got last time was a little poor bite Right,plaice not turbot That is unless you can get sole of course Unless I can get sole,of course I see,bye,bye then I wonder what Robert is doing now He is not at the fishmongers Oh,Robert you don't know how revolting you look when you are smug That's a turn out from the books Subtitles by Nostromo
