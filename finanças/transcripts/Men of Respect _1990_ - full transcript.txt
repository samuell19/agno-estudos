Unusual weather patterns continue to plague the metropolitan area. Heavy rain and near-freezing temperatures have resulted in treacherous travel conditions on local roads and highways. ...heroin reaching the United States in an unusually pure and smokable form has reached epidemic proportions. Local police forces are helpless... A K.G.B. defector surfaced after 10 years in the C.I.A., stating, "No secret lasts forever." Among his shocking revelations was that the K.G.B. may have plotted to kill the pope. The I.R.S. today unfolded a comprehensive plan to bring... ...targets have been reached. ...and senior citizens who seemed helpless... ...members of society... ...north side riots last month. Police officials expressed belief and faith in the justice system. They condemned the media for its... ...resulting in the death of a security officer and seriously injuring several employees. Further down the grand concourse, the offices of the truckers benevolent association were destroyed by a fire of suspicious origin. Fire officials say arson will not be ruled out. A likely target for today's bloodletting, say federal officials, is Charles "the Little Padrino" D'Amico. Key members or captains of that prime family were found murdered gangland style signaling a struggle for power in the criminal underworld. Do you want me to go in with you? Just cover me from the window. I'll get closer to him if I'm alone. We got his brother-in-law. Fuck you. And a year later, they think he's fucking disabled. Out of the ballpark. Right out of the ballpark. How about his brother? Battaglia. Watch the front! Keep an eye on it. Come on. Move it. Move it. One of you get the driveway. Nobody gets in here. Nobody. What's going on? Who died? If I knew what's going on, I'd tell you what's going on. Is this going to go on all night? Just take the kid and go upstairs, would you? Mal's fine, come on. Just come inside. Go upstairs, will you? Shh. Oh, Jesus. And who else did you talk to? Yeah, but you tried, right? Yeah. Well, they know just when to take a powder. And how many went down by you? And the rest? In the hospital? You better do this, you get some people over there. They might try to hit you again when you think it's past and over. And what about Cordaro's people over by Belmont? Huh? Will you get us word on that? Jesus Christ! They just pulled Louie Fence out of Bronx River. There goes our muscle on Westchester... Oh, shut the fuck up! What else? They hit all the after-hours joints, from Vegas Parlor to Whitestone Billiards. Major damage. The policy people up on Fordham took a hit and we haven't heard the end of that yet. Everybody's running scared. There's not going to be so much as a diner, dry cleaner, nothing open on the North End tomorrow. What about Vinnie Cordaro? If Vinnie Cordaro turns on you, you lose all your strength from Riverdale down to the West Side. You know, Duffy, if you think somebody sold us out here I want to know why nobody's been hit in Kingsbridge. That's your territory, ain't it? That's because, Tony, my boy, I'm a mean fucking Irishman who doesn't encourage shit from nobody. What are we going to do, Pop? You'll make the peace, Charlie. Take the family to Florida. Enjoy your years in the sun. With all respects, Padrino mio. Don't look at me like that now. Show respect. It's you I'm looking out for. Cordaro's got us by the balls here. And he's got the Greek's muscle. The Greek is dead. What are you talking about? What happened? It was Battaglia. Mike Battaglia? What a piece of work this guy is. Go easy. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. All right, get him a drink or something. Don't just stand there. All right, take it easy, Sal. Easy does it. Now, just talk to me. Battaglia got wind of Cordaro's scheme. But instead of laying low, washing his hands of it, he hooks up with me and Bankie Como. A loan shark from Fremont, Charlie. He's a standup guy, Charlie. We tracked the Greek down to this fish place on City Island. The Poseidon Adventure or some shit. The Greek's buttons are all over the place. They're doing calamari and clams. Having a real time of it. Real pleased with themselves. Assholes. Battaglia heads right in the front and goes straight for the Greek, grabs him by the throat, spits in his face, cursing him for the two-face that he is. Snake in the grass. Yeah, all hell breaks loose. I mean, we covered him from the window and he's shooting up the place. I mean, leads flying around there like confetti and he doesn't take a scratch. The Greek's buttons are running for the door. And Bankie's guys cut them down in the street. I mean, blood's running like Hershey's over there. Oh, Christ, I can't do it justice. You had to be there. The guy's got luck. Wait a minute. What about the Greek? Is the Greek done? Oh, he's dead. He's finished. Him and half his crew. Battaglia and the shylock took off on foot and I swung by here. All right. Come on, let's get this guy to a doctor. Come on, get him out of here. Take him to the Indian doctor on Barnes Street. He'll keep his mouth shut. Now, listen up. This is the first order of business. I want Cordaro. I want Cordaro off by sundown. Is that understood? And I want to hear about it on the 6:00 news. And Mike Battaglia, Lou, you find Mike Battaglia before they lay a hit on him and when you find him, you treat him as a man of respect. Is that clear? It's done. All right. Cordaro's loss, that's Battaglia's gain. Do you know these guys? Yeah, but I don't trust them. Hey, Battaglia. Como, hey, wait up. We want to talk to you! Have you come for your fortune? My wife Lucia will read for you. She has the gift. Second sight. You've come to question her, yes? Yeah, we'd like to see her. Straighten up. They're customers. What will they think? Sit. She'll be right with you. What now? You must make your offering. We all of us, have two faces. The one we wear for all to see, the other, darker, more deadly. She's showing you her other face. Watch. Welcome, Signor Battaglia, and welcome to your companion, Signor Como. Give me your hand. Are you frightened? I only bring you to yourself. Come closer. Good. Oh, you are very brave. Brave men fear you. You have stood well for your Padrino. You will be capo regime. And the time comes when you will be called Padrino. Padrino Battaglia. What do I have to do for this to happen? You only have to be yourself, to do what you are thinking. Signor Como. Do you not wish to know your fate? No, thanks, I'll find out soon enough. You are not frightened, are you? Frightened of that which you cannot escape? You also are a brave soldier. A man of respect and a man of honor. But fate will not be so kind to you as to your children. Your family will be great. And your son will be Padrino. Your son will be boss of all bosses. My son, Philly, in this business? Over my dead body. As you have said. All right, come on, Mikey, let's get the fuck out of here. Let's leave this joint. Cup of joe, huh? Channel 4: the news. The cleanup continues on City Island, after a wild shooting melee believed connected to the underworld war, left 5 dead and dozens wounded. A witness was able to identify... ...and without mercy. Among the victims, was Ali "the Greek" Bernacci, a reputed strong arm and lieutenant to the so-called D'Amico Crime Family. The daring gunmen escaped on foot. The police, unable to invade the complex web of treaties and alliances in the criminal underworld say it is virtually impossible to predict who will emerge as victors in the latest clash. Yeah. It's me. Are you all right? I'm good. I'm good. It couldn't have gone better. Hell of a downpour out there tonight. Yeah, it's quite a ruckus. You catch, uh, the report... The weather report? Yeah, I was just getting it. But, the forecast is good, no? Well, the forecast is good. It's still a little cloudy, but it's good. As soon as it clears up, I'm on my way. You should make it in before it starts coming down again. You know? Yeah, I know. I'm on my way. And, Michael, be careful. Don't worry, I'm all right. I'm on my way. Your pal's good. There's no problem. Just friends. We are a fraternity of great honor. And we welcome only men of strength, courage and loyalty. Men of respect. Our way comes before anything else in life. Before God, before country, before family. You have sworn an oath, and we have embraced you. You have obeyed our laws without question and you have guarded the secrets of our thing. And you have shown respect and loyalty no less than a son. You are the fruit of our enterprise and you have earned yourself a very special place in our thing. Draw the blood. Buona salute. Capo regime. Battaglia! Battaglia! Mikey. Yeah, Mike. You're right. Take care. Okay. Grazie. All right. Thank you. Congratulations. Congratulations. I'll see you guys later. Okay. She had the gift. I could feel it. I wanted to talk to her more. Get more out of her, but... I don't know. I, I don't know if it's good or bad. On one hand, you feel like it bolsters your chances. And, on the other it brings up all these bad thoughts. Still, the old lady was right on the money. Charlie laid it right in my lap. Cordaro's out and I'm in. So, it's half-true already. But the rest of it, Padrino Battaglia. I don't know. It only stands to reason. Charlie's at the top of his game, and then he's got his sons there. How do you get around that? I can't think about it. Whatever happens, happens. If it's meant to be, it'll be. What, you don't think so? How can you say that? You see, this is what worries me for you. You have all these reasons to hesitate when you should be trying for something. It don't need me to interfere. He's gonna dick you around. You don't know that. Charlie's always been fair with us. We're part of his family. Charlie stood up for me, all right? I swore to Charlie. I've stepped in shit on the street cleaner than Charlie D'Amico. This is Padrino D'Amico here, all right? We have respect. Charlie respects the fat end of a bat. The sharp end of a stick. Charlie respects what he fears and that ain't you. You just wait and see what he has in mind. All Charlie cares about is number one, him and his. That's why Charlie is Charlie, and you're not. Why do you have to wait for other people to give you? Why does everything always have to pass through somebody else's hands? Show a little ambition. Stop it, all right! I'm as ambitious as the next guy. More, all right! My time comes, I'll know it, and I'll know what to do. This is the time and you better know it now. This is it. Staring you in the face. Don't close your eyes. You don't know what you're asking. Tell me... Tell me you don't want it. If I was the man, I'd know what to do. There's no guarantee if Charlie's out of the picture we'll be any better off. In this life, Michael, there's no safe standing still. What? What? The Padrino sends his regards. He's going to pay us a visit. You're kidding. He wants us to put him up and lay out a spread. A sit down. Look how he loves you. He trusts you. You can have him here with his pants down. And, Michael, if you got him here... You got him here. Padrino. Hey, come on, give me a hug. I owe you a big thanks. You know that. Charlie, you embarrass me. I'm just the lucky one who had the opportunity. Ruthie, hey. Look at her. She still looks like a fox. Doesn't she look great? Yeah, sure, turn on the charm. I'm slaving away here, makin' everything you like. Ziti and clams, shrimp oregonata, pappardelle... What I must look like? You look fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. I have to ask you a question. How can a beautiful princess like you find her way around the kitchen? From a book. And I ask questions. A book? It should be a good book. Well, you're in for a big surprise. Well, you don't have to get pissed off at me. Come on, I'm just kidding with you. Come on, just give me a kiss. Ah, that's good. Thank you. You know what? I think I'm gonna run away with your wife. Charlie, what can I say, she likes you. Yeah? Well, come on, let me show you what's what. Come on. Come on in. Pleasant place you got here. Really good! Keep going, kid. Oh, I smell something nice. Smells good. Everybody sit down. The first thing I want to tell you is I want to... I want to thank you because I got 20 years back from you guys tonight. It's true. Which brings me to what I want to talk about tonight, which is retirement. Retirement of our dear, faithful friend and counselor Carmelo Rossi. Believe me, I can't think of anybody who deserves it more. I can't think of anybody who has spent more time in the trenches. But then... How long do you impose on a human being? So, you'll excuse me, Carmelo, but I think it's time for you to, uh... Retire. I think you should go south. I think you should take a vacation. And I think we should all show our appreciation. You don't worry about Carmelo. He'll be all right. Now, let me get to what's important tonight. Let me talk about the man of the hour. I don't know what to say about this guy. Really, I don't know what to say. He's a real standup guy. Never makes any trouble. Never causes any ruckus. He never, never, says no to a friend. Yeah, well, we can sit here tonight and we can be complacent, you know, and fall asleep on our big fat asses, but what happens when trouble comes knockin' at the door? Who opens the door and gives trouble a mouthful of teeth? Mikey Battaglia here! Buona salute, Mike! Buona salute! Tone it down. I tell you, if it wasn't for you... This caucus would be a frigging wake instead of a party. 'Cause it's guys like you, it's guys like Battaglia, guys like Bankie Como, it's guys like my nephew Sally there. They are the ones we depend upon for the future of our thing. Oh, I... I have to make a personal note. I think my time is short. No, you got a lot of years left, Charlie, a lot of years. Whoa! Charlie! It's all right with me, I mean, I got peace in my heart here, I got my two boys here, I got 'em. And I'm proud like any father. Now, what I want from you guys is to support them. You support them, because if you don't, I'm gonna sic Mike Battaglia on you here, and he's gonna bite your ass. All right, you're all sitting there like it's a goddamn gloomy occasion! It's like a holiday! Come on, let me hear it from you guys! Mike Battaglia, Mike Battaglia! Yeah, I want to say to all of you, grazie a tutti! Grazie, grazie, grazie! What are you thinkin' about, pal? Well, it's just a big responsibility. Sobers you up. You know what I was thinking about? The old lady. I forgot all about that. Seems there was some truth to what she was saying to you. That goes in one ear and out the other. Good. That's good. I'm gonna go get some sleep. You know, if things do, uh, turn out, you could, uh, make out all right. Hmm. That's good to know. Just so I don't have to do anything where I can't look at myself in the mirror. That goes without saying. Be careful, amico mio. Shit happens. And it can get very deep from here on in. Was he asking for me? What do you think? I think I better get downstairs. Wait a minute. You're not losing your nerve? Just let it go, all right? I can see it in your face. You're fighting yourself over this thing. Hey, what am I going to do, put a gun to his head now? The man is applauding me. I should be watching his back, not sticking the knife in myself. He's throwing you a bone because he's desperate. He's showing me respect, all right? I want I should enjoy it already. Charlie's just keeping you down. The D'Amicos are always gonna keep you down. It makes me sick how they use you. You do everything. They do nothing. But they have everything, and we don't have anything. If you could take it from them, take it. You deserve it. I want you to have it. It's not yours to give, babe. Don't mock me, Michael. Why don't you understand how impossible this is? It's not the time for this. Don't tell me how impossible it is. Don't tell me it's not the time! I don't understand. Because I've heard it all before, and I do understand. Don't... Don't go into that. I will. I will go into it. I don't want to hear about this now. Well, you're going to hear about it 'cause I know what it is to do something so it can break your heart. Don't! I know what it is to have a life inside me and squashing it out because it's not the right time. It's too difficult. I know what it is to kill for you, Michael. So don't tell me I don't understand. Kate. Grazie. Yeah. Charlie's chippy is through for the evening. I'll take care of Ray and Jamesy. Michael. What's goin' on with you? If it's gonna get done, it better get done quick. I'll ring once when it's clear. You'll find what you need under the mattress. Jeez, look at this. Hey, you still up, Ruthie? Shh! You should see the mess they left me, and they want a big breakfast tomorrow. A woman's work is never done. Tell me about it. Still, but I figured you fellas were out here. You could use a little something to get you through the night. Thank you. Oh, that's good. Mr. Coffee. You like it? Oh, thanks a lot. All right, see you boys in the morning. Thank you. Mikey? I did it. Did you hear him? Noise. When he started to scream? The cat screamed. I stepped on a damn cat. No, before that. Who's across the way? What are you doing with that? You're supposed to leave it. Give it to me. Michael, give it to me! Give it to me! Michael, fix yourself. Go on! Go on! What is it with me? I can't stop shaking! It's over. It's done. I got blood on me, too. I'm not crying about it. It's that prick's blood. I should dye my hair with it. Now, get that off. The rain ain't washing it clean. Take it all off. Come on. Come here. He saw it was me. He looked right at me. Water and it's all gone. You see how easy that was? If I had bought it yesterday, it would have been a good life. Now we'll see. Yeah, I hear you, man, wait up. I hear you, man, wait up. What, do I got to drop everything? Don't bang on the door, man, it's glass. Glass breaks. Then what? You gonna clean it up? Just open the frigging door, and nobody has to break it, okay? Who do you want? Just open the door or I'll break your ass. You gonna break my ass? That's right. Then I'm not gonna open the door. Let him in, Sterling. Here I am. Congratulations. This guy has an attitude. He means well. I do? Sterling, you'll get clipped in the mouth if you don't shut up. Sorry. Charlie up yet? I don't know. We'll take a look. You finished up? Just about. Take the day off. Take the day off? Yeah. Go home? Yeah. Take the day off? Sterling, get the hell out of here, all right? Okay. I was supposed to get him at 6:00. It's near 7:00. The damn parkway was flooded. He's in the guesthouse. Man, they said there was an earthquake. Earthquake on the East Coast. Charlie! I mean, rocks fell on the thruway. We got cars jammed up all the way to Poughkeepsie. - Charlie? They had a death toll, it's not even a holiday. Charlie? Well, I guess you just can't, uh, fuck with the ozone, right? It was a rough night. Charlie? It's coming, I'm telling you, the end of the world. Everybody dies. Oh, my God! Look at him! What are you talking about? They destroyed him! They hit Charlie! Where the hell was everybody? They killed him! They hit Charlie! They killed him! Where was everybody? The bastards killed him! They killed him! There's a fuckin' war going on here! The bastard killed him! Hey, anybody here? They killed him. Find his men! They hit Charlie! I don't know who! Where the fuck were you then? Mike, what the fuck is going on? They hit your father! What? What are you talking about? Who? Who? Rossi who! Ray and Jamesy! They must've gone over to Rossi! There's blood on my walls! The fucking bastards! Don't, Mikey! Mikey! Stop! Mike, no! Don't kill him! Take him alive, no, Mikey, you fuck! Who sent them? Who sent them? Tell me! Tell me! Or I'll kill your whole fucking family! Tell me, you fuck! Tell me. Tell me. Tell me, you fuck. Tell me! Sally, get that garbage out of here. The other prick, too. Sammy, Ralphie, Benny, get them out of here. Pretty quick on the draw, aren't you, Mikey? What, I should have a sit-down talk with them? Charlie was like my own. He was my own. You do to him, you do to me! I'm gonna make them choke on this, man! I'm gonna make them regret the day they were born! Rossi and whoever else! So, everybody better declare yourself on this, one side or the other! All right. All right. Let's, uh... Let's just keep a calm head about this, huh? Now, uh... I say we clean this whole thing up. We go inside and we get our stories straight. Matty! Matty! Wait up a minute. You take a powder now, you'll never get your two cents in on this. My thing was with Charlie. Now Charlie's history. In a few days, Charlie will be geography. I'm not hanging around to be anybody's landmark. You pricks want to bury each other, you can count me out. Look, look, nothing is final with this, Matty. We could come out of this. We? Since when the hell is it we? Since when do we do business together? You got your head up Battaglia's ass. Enjoy the smell. The way I figure it, the closer to you pricks, the nearer to God! Florence D'Amico... I'm very sorry. He was a good man. Yeah. Yeah. This is my son, Phillip. Mrs. D'Amico, I'm very sorry. You taking good care of your father? He cooks. I clean. We worked out a system. Charlie would've liked him. Charlie liked everybody. Oh, he was good. He was too good. He couldn't say no! No more, Charlie! Charlie, no more! Mama! Mama! Take her for a walk. Come on. Take her for a walk. Look, Mal, I'm sorry. I don't know what I said. I'm sorry. Yeah, okay. My son, Phillip. You have my sympathies. Yeah, thank you. We'll be over here. Philly! It's been a long time. How are you? Can you believe that this big lummox is mine? I hear good things from your father, says you're doing good things. He tells me I'm wet behind the ears. MBA. Baruch. Mikey, you got to talk to this kid. He can take a dime and turn it into a dollar overnight and you don't have to worry about your rap sheet. Pop, come on. You getting shy on me now? I keep telling him, "You got to sell yourself." Am I right? We got to sit down. Now's not the circumstances. I'd like to hear what you got to say. Thanks, Mikey. No Duffy? No hide, no hair. Make an inquiry. Listen, Battaglia sends word through cousin Sally. He wants to know what we'll do. He wants to sit down and talk. What do you want to do? You want to sit with him? No. We're not sitting down with nobody. There's a gun behind every smile here. I got some tickets. I want you to take Susan to Toronto, and I'm gonna take Ma to Miami, okay? I think we're better off going separate till we find out what went on here. No, I don't know, Mal. Doesn't sound like the right thing to do. I mean, we just walk away from everything Pop set up? So, what do you want to do? You want to stay here? You might as well jump into the grave with him. Trust me. Look at that. They got him crowned already. I'm going to try to get Michael to go. We've been here awhile. Yeah. I'd love to stay till morning, but we better get going. Okay. I'll see you. Bye. It was a pleasure. Nice to meet you. I see through him like glass. Charlie's not even cold yet and he's strutting his son over there. He was there with the old lady. She tantalized him. And now with my success, he thinks it's good. When was the last time you ever see that guy on the street? Never. Now he gets unveiled like the second coming. Like the big marker. He's gonna start making money for his friends. You can give me your cell number. I'll give you a card. He's in business. What the hell's going on here? Hey, Mikey. You remember my son Philly. You want a burger, Mike? MBA, Baruch. He'll take a dime and turn it into a dollar overnight and you don't have to worry about your rap sheet. Oh, Pop, come on. What, you getting shy on me here? You want a hot dog, Mike? Yeah, Mikey, how about a hot dog? The two-faced scumbag. That it would even cross his mind. Bankie Como. I step out to make myself felt and known. I suffer the risk, so as what? So his punk kid makes out? What about me and mine? It should be one of mine, a son of mine that gets the benefit. So what is it you want to do? He's no friend of yours. Como's watching out for his. He's looking to the future. And the future is now. First opportunity. Hello. Hey, you prick. How are you? Hey, Mikey, how are you, pal? I got this thing here tonight. I don't hear from you or anything. I tell you, Mikey, since the wife passed I, uh... I don't like to go to those things. You know, I avoid them. I don't want to hear that. I got a place saved for you. I expect to see you. All right, look, I'll make an appearance, okay? But do me a favor. Don't glue me to a chair, okay? Please. And while you're at it, uh, bring your kid there. I've been hearing some things. No, nothing really. Just, uh... Just, uh, you know, some bookkeeping and accounting and stuff like that. That's all. Well, now's the time. I want to sit down. I want to pick his brain. I'll tell you the truth, Mikey. He's kinda tied up with some stuff. You know, it's hard to get away. What the hell's with you? You trying to keep me from a good thing? You don't love me anymore? Mikey, I love you, but you are a pain in the ass. And while you're at it, you can do me another favor. What? Uh, that pork store? Yeah, with the sharp provolone. Pick me up a couple of pounds, will you? You got it. Good, good. And hurry up, will you? Because it ain't a party until you get here. I'll see you there. Thanks, Peter. Pay the man. You think Mikey's gonna like you taking a bite out of his sausage? Fuck him. Keep it. Yeah. Oh, God! God! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Take it easy. They ain't heard the last of this. Come on, keep talking. Keep talking. Keep talking, Pop. Philly. Yeah. You're gonna be okay. Philly. You're, you're gonna be... No, come on, Pop! No, Pop, come on! Pop, you're gonna be... You're gonna be... Pop! Oh, Pop. You look fantastic. Thanks. Hi! Diana. Oh, right. Hi, nice to meet you. Go get some champagne? Here, you want some? Go ahead, go ahead. Don't forget about that horse I told you, Great Scot. Be seein' ya next time it runs. You cut his fucking throat? I emptied my gun, all right. You could drive a truck through his chest. Now, you tell me the same for the kid and we'll drink on it. Mikey, don't. Mikey. You got a whole crowd out there. Go easy. The old man's finished? He's dead, man. He's a ghost. You can forget about him. Good. No offense. He didn't mean nothing by it. So now we follow through on this. Tomorrow, maybe. All you got to do is just call. And don't worry about this other thing. He's as good as dead. Hey. What was that all about? We were just laughing about his mother-in-law's wake last month. It was a real pisser. No, no, no, before that, like, like, you didn't want me to hear. Like you knew something, uh, you don't want me to hear. Something said. What are you talking about? We're just... We're just shooting the shit here. It's got nothing to do with you. Well, don't try to fuck with my head, Tommy. Okay? You think you know something? You got something to say? You get it out. Mikey. Nothing. All right. But it's marked down now. It's down, so I remember it. What do you want us to say? We apologize? We're sorry. Whatever was said. Done. Michael, what's the matter? Mikey, there's no problem here. We're supposed to be having a good time here! It's a party! You all right? Yeah, I'm all right. You want me to sit with you? Sit. Dance, eat, drink. Whatever the fuck you want to do, do it. Since when do you ask? Go easy with that. What are you... What are you watching me here? You watch them. Them's who you watch. What is it with you? Where did he go? Who? Bankie. Como. He was right here. Look, he was... He was bleeding all over the table there. It's wine, Michael. The Chianti fell over. He's here. Will you stop it? He got it over on me. He's fucking with me! You just don't... You just don't disappear into thin air. Michael, come upstairs. Lay down. Just... Just look for him, all right? If he's over here, I'll cut his fucking throat. What is going on with you? Mikey, Mike, what are you doing? Mikey, what are you doing? Mikey, Mike, what are you doing? Mike's not feeling well, here. It's the flu or something. Frigging medication. You all right? You all right, Mike? You got a little fever, right, honey? And, and, and he drank a little too much. And he gets this way if he drinks too much. We're gonna go upstairs for a while. Maybe we ought to call it a day, Ruthie, huh? Mikey's not feeling well, and we'll beat the traffic. No, no. I won't hear of it. We got everything prepared nice. We want you to stay. Right, Mike? Time was, you shot the guy's brains out and he'd die and that was the end of it. Now, it comes back at you. You've got to stop it. And if drinking does this to you, you got to stop it. You can't go broadcasting yourself to everybody, you might as well draw them a picture. This thing was to make friends, keep friends. You're gonna push them away. I'm sorry. I messed up your party there. I'll, I'll, I'll make it up. No, no, no, no. Don't, it's all right. You just lie down. Lie down. Lie down. Sober. You get some rest first. I got... I got to get back. You come down later, all right? All right? You shake a few hands... Promise a few favors... And all's forgotten. Everybody will love everybody again. I'm better. You? It's just that I have these thoughts. Nothing's worth this grief. Duffy ever make an appearance? He's got it in for me. How do you know that? I got ears everywhere. Eyes. We're not out of the woods yet. Get some sleep. I can't sleep anymore. You can't do nothing asleep. I'm going out for a while. There's a storm outside. Today we're going to make capo d'agnello which is the Southern Italian pronunciation of an Italian dish known as Capo d'agnello, which translates into English as lamb's head. Be careful not to lose the brain. If it pops out And place on a well-greased baking sheet eyeball side down. What we do now is bake slowly for one to two hours until the eyeball becomes opaque and the meat releases... Didn't you hear me? I was banging on the door. Shh. It's almost done. It's wicked out there. Like magic, no? I'd like to question your wife. She knows what you want. Everything has its cost, Mr. Battaglia. You know that, yes? You want, you pay. There is a price on everything. You are very generous. This is very good. A man willing to pay the high price will receive everything he wishes. Everything he wants. And deserves. Signora. No, no. Now, drink the tea. Don't be so impatient. Everything comes soon enough. When you're finished, she'll read the leaves. Sit. Speak to the man. Can't you see he's on a bed of nails here? I see fear. Great fear. Are you frightened, Battaglia? You're not a fearful man. Are you? What is he fearful for? I see a large man with a red face. Blood? No, not this one. Still in the skin. A red face, the complexion. An Irishman? Duffy. This man is very dangerous to you. He doesn't respect you. And he will not play by your rules. Be bold, Battaglia, and resolute. Look at your face, Battaglia. Such grief for a man when life has given all that was asked. Come on, it can't all be bad. What else is seen? You lead a charmed life, Battaglia. No man of woman born can harm you. Laugh and scorn those who try. Fear not traitors or conspirators for not till the stars fall from the heavens will Battaglia's blood be shed. Is this so? She has said it. Mark her words. I have a charmed life. Have I been wrong? Hey, kid. Your old man at home? Just a minute. You got two suspicious characters at the door. You want to see? Oh, yeah. Bob, Paulie, come on in. I'll be right with you. Is this necessary? Hell, yeah. Just, uh, they like the zoo, they haven't been in a while, so I asked them along. You expect me to believe that? Is your father ready? Who knows. How are you doing, boys? We're doing fine. Hi, Mrs. Duffy. Um, Mom, can I ask you a question? Yeah. Is Pop a wise guy? Where did you pick that up? I hear things. Well, don't hear that. He's your father and he loves you and that's all you have to know. It doesn't answer my question. Behave yourself. You're the only wise guy I know. Yeah, look, keep a little behind today. The old lady, she goes crazy. Yeah? Jesus, George, it's a day off here today. George, I'm going to the zoo with my kid, George. George, it's not my beef any more. I washed my hands of it. Psst. Your father doesn't know how to take a day off. It's not my problem. I'm out of it. George, look, look, look. What do you have to call me on Sundays for? Move over. I'm hanging up. Oh, Jesus. No. Oh, God! Somebody help me. I'll see the nickel. Oh, the boss has got you by the balls, Felix. And I'll go one, two, three dimes shy. I think maybe he's bluffing. It's your funeral. Mike... Wait. Wait a minute. Frig it. $3,000, I'm not that interested. I'm out. He had shit. He was going for the flush. You punked out. What the fuck are you talking about? You weren't even in the pot. So he bluffs me with shit and he wins. If I bet into him, he gets the flush, he wins. So what's the difference? He wins. He wins. That's why I dropped out. The guy's got luck out the un gatz. I don't know. It's the wrong frigging business when you put in more than you get out. What are you doing? What am I doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm doing what others should be doing, but I have to do. It was done this morning. It's done every morning. Clean linen every morning, and not an order of business. Wait, Ruthie, is this necessary? I'm sick and tired. Wait, wait, wait. Whose side are you on that you'd ask me that there? Ruthie, Jesus, what kind of question is that? My side, right? Yeah. Well, then I'm sick and tired of this shit. Who comes? Who eats in a place that has a reputation for filth? They were cleaned. They were filth. Look! Look! Look at them. Just, just look! Everything. Dirt. Okay! Well, now it's... It's dirty. Yeah, now, then, before, every time. I got eyes in my head. I can see. All right, Ruthie. Be calm. Let them... Let them do it. They're here to do it. It'll be done. I can't... I can't catch my breath. Just, just relax there, all right? I'm taking her upstairs, Bingo. Take care of things. You know, guys, I don't want to start nothing here, but, uh, you get wind on Duffy? Man, they say he, uh, he split town. So, that's good, no? Not if he hooks up with Rossi and the D'Amicos. What's the matter with you? There ain't no love lost between Rossi and those two. Not since Rossi got the slap in the face from the old man. I don't know about that. I don't know. Those two, if they hook up together, they could make things really difficult. Very difficult, I'm thinking. If they all hook up together, you'll see how fast I walk. Well, you better walk real fast because I'll run right over you. You know, Ralph, you're a real scumbag with that shit. Sal, relax. For Christ's sake, Sally, we're only talking through our hats here. Nobody's going anywhere. Sally, we're talking about what's being talked about. Here, have a pretzel. Deal the cards. Come on, ante up. You in? You in? Come on, fresh deck, huh? What's the matter, huh? You want to talk? We could talk. Talk to me. What... What are you doing to yourself? Oh, don't, don't, come on. Come on. Don't. Don't. Bad blood is a bad thing. And it's bad for our enterprise. Most of all, it allows our enemies to divide and conquer. Who turns on who? Before you know it, you got the public, and the feds even in on it. But those of us with a long history in our thing have a lot to fall back on. If I can play a part in cementing old friendships and ending this dispute, it would be very gratifying to me. And of course, to others whose things are affected. My appeal and this is to you, Mal, and, Don, you too, there, is only that I be returned to the position of honor and respect that I enjoyed before all this unpleasantness began. I make no excuses for my father. As Padrino, it was his right, his prerogative to see his way in these matters. Your father was a rash man. I know what he was doing. He was thinking he was watching out for your interests. But you must not resent my telling you that you were not ready. Don't... Don't for a minute think that you'll get my consideration by insulting me. I do not rest until we all spit on the grave of your father's murderer. Let me come in here. I do not hope to interfere. Mal, Don, I feel your father's presence here. I know he's up there and he looks down and blesses this. Carmelo Rossi, do you consent to be my consigliere? Do you consent to put my interests above your own, and my life and those of my blood, before you and yours? Padrino mio, I accept. Good. Good. Very good. We'll be in touch. We'll discuss and settle all the details. All right? What do you know about this Como kid? A brat, but he's got his father's head for numbers and a lot of new ideas. And an ax to grind, like the rest of us. I think, maybe, you should make use of him. He could be very helpful down the line. As a favor to you, Padrino. No, no, no. You think of it as a favor to yourself. As you wish. Just wait here, Doc, and give it a minute. When was the last time she did this? She does it every night. Every night after the Padrino's gone on his rounds. There she comes. There. There. See? And there. Can't leave it like that. You don't think they'll see? It's right where they can see. There, see? No, no. She doesn't see you. She shines a light on you, but she doesn't see nothing. Is her husband aware of this condition? He won't do anything. He's very protective of her. He keeps everybody away from her. Who would've thought the old man had so much blood in him? I can't get it out. It stains. It smells. You should not be involved in this. Take my advice. You've got to stop it, Michael. You stop dwelling on it. It's all over your face. Now, come on. It's done. Come on. Before they see us. Matty? Uh, sorry for the wait, but I think it was worth the while. Our sympathies for your loss, Matt. I apologize I didn't make your father's wake. No disrespect was intended. He was a friend to me and a loss. It's forgotten. It's all forgotten. Let's all go up on the patio, huh? It's a lot cooler. I'm sorry for your troubles, Matt. We're going to set it right. Matt, Mal and Don are ready to lay claim to the interests of the D'Amico family. Now, do you find your interests consistent with theirs and, if so, what considerations do you expect for your cooperation and goodwill? I'm prepared to renew and honor my commitment to your father, and to repair our previous arrangement. Nothing more, nothing less. That's very generous. Alla tua salute. What about the wet work, Matt? I'll provide the muscle. Until Mal and Don deal with any stragglers in this thing and everybody has declared themselves. Then I expect the burden to be shared equally by all. But I demand one concession: Battaglia is mine. Not a drop of blood, not a hair on his head, not a scratch until I bring myself there and he stands in front of me. Matt, this could be a very messy business. People get carried away. Not a drop of blood. Not a scratch. That's to be made clear to all concerned. Agreed. If you could call him, call him, and let me know. Let me know, I'll be here. Right. Yeah. Yeah, 9:30. That's right. Okay. No, I don't know. I don't know. Hold it. I'm trying to follow through on this Leonetti thing. Yeah, I got to go. All right, goodbye. He's taking a powder here. What about all the joints up on the concourse? No answer. Left and gone. Same with the Vegas Parlor and the clubs. It's like a cancer spreading here. I don't want to hear it. Put on your hat and deal with it. You're the underboss here. Do your job! And you tell them, if things aren't straightened out they're gonna see my face on the street. And that they're not gonna like. Let's get a game going here, huh? Come on. Come on. Deal the cards, huh? All of a sudden people are worried about the D'Amico's. There ain't nothing... There ain't nothing to worry about. I got all the luck. Not a man of woman born can do shit to me. You a man of woman born? You got a brain? Think about it, huh? Huh? Damn right! Damn it! I don't want no more reports. Not a man of woman born. What's that supposed to mean? Is that supposed to be a frigging riddle? It's me. Ruth? It's only me. What day is it? I don't know. Thursday, Friday. You're looking a little better there. You do. You'll be up and at it in no time. When you're ready and on your feet, we'll do something. We'll go to a... We'll go to a... You know... We'll have a party. A big thing and that we invite, and... It'll be good. We don't have any friends. Well, the hell with them. We got ourselves. Since when do we need more than that? Hey, Sal, hi. How's it going? Come inside. I have to do this. Get him out of here. Ralphie, Artie, Petey, you guys cover the front. The rest of you guys come with me. Come on, let's go! They want to come, let them come. Leave him. Leave him. Come on, let's get the hell out of here. Go! Go, you scumbags! I'll settle with you later! Mikey! Maybe we should get out of her, okay? You got Ruthie up there and maybe we're not so lucky. You just give me time to grab Ruthie there. We'll make it out back in the dark. Ruthie, we got to... Oh, my God. Ruthie. What did you do? Ruthie, what did you do? Oh, God, Ruthie! Oh, God! Oh, God! I don't like this. Yeah. I ain't waiting to find out. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on! Idiot! Mikey? Get out of here! Wait, wait, they're cornering us here! We ain't going to make it in the dark. The sky's lit up out there. Mikey, you'd think the stars were dropping, Mikey. That's it! That's it! Who is it? You'd be afraid to hear it! For Charlie. Born of women. All of you. What's it gonna be? Who's next? Who's the unlucky fuck? Come on! Come on and get me! Don't be a fool, Duffy. My hands are wet enough with blood of yours already. Your luck's run out, Mikey. I wouldn't bet on it, man. Don't. I'll kill you if I have to. You're fast for a big fuck! Yeah. It's an Irishman's luck. No comparison. I got a charmed life, Matty. No man born of woman can touch me. Yeah, I heard that story. I got one of my own. I've got all the time in the world. Did I ever tell you how I get my name, Mikey? Yeah, from your whore mother, 'cause you're a bastard. You're gonna wish. Remember Father Duffy, the priest from the Bronx? Had the orphanage there on 149th street. One night, about 40 years ago, the nuns there open the door and find a woman laying there ready to drop a kid. She was in bad shape, Mikey. On the way out. When the emergency got there, they rushed her to the hospital. But she didn't make it. The intern ripped the little fucker from her belly! Get my drift, Mikey? You know who that kid was? I was that kid! I'm not a man of woman born. And I'm gonna kill you. Shit happens. Ain't that the truth. We have come together to make a new member. Who stands up for this man? I do. Have him step forward. Draw the blood. You are entering a fraternity of great honor. A fraternity that welcomes only men of great courage and loyalty. Men of respect. You come swear with us alive, and you are with us until death. Our thing comes first above everything else in your life. Before God, before country, and before family.
