Dongra! Dongra, come out for cruel monster. Jatt Jeona Morh is here to fulfill his promise to Rano. Love makes Jatts go crazy. Will you come out now, Or will you stay inside and keep barking like a dog? I am already here. If you want, I can make an entrance, again. And forget barking, I didn't say a word. I want Rano. I want 10,000. You get girls married, you don't sell them, you frog. I want 10,000. I want Rano. I want 10,000. I want Rano. I want Rano! Yeah, Rano, right! First give me 10,000 rupees you got from the RPO. -Dongra! -What? Sometimes, I feel like I've given birth to Guggu Gill. I feel like breaking your VCR. And I also feel like breaking the legs of my useless son. Father! Don't break the VCR, you can break my legs if you want. I made a mistake. Please forgive me. Father! You will not be forgiven. I thought you spent the money. But you slept with the money in your pocket. You didn't even lock the door? What's the use when everyone will know? You lock the door when you are drunk. -But I drink every day. -The door is locked... -You Dum. -Mummy! That's enough. We had decided on one slap a day. You have already slapped him once. Get ready, Sukhi. It's time for you to go to college. Say that it's time to waste petrol. What will you take to shut up? Give me this tea. But mummy, you'd said that you wanted to go to the market today. Oh, yes. I needed to buy some clothes. Sukhi, we need to buy some clothes for Bholi too. Do you want anything? -Yes.. -What? Slippers. This is like hitting a jackpot. It's always very good to help your mother. I swear on God. I'll never say no to mother again. Are they fine? Show me a ten number size slipper. That doesn't seem like your size, ma'am. It's for my father. -Yes. -Show it to her. Great print on the dress. She is looking very nice today. What kind do you want? Show one with great print on it. How many meters? What? Brother, slippers have designs. I know. Dresses have prints on them. What happened, ma'am? You didn't like it? Shall I show you something else? I usually don't get things of my liking in a local market. Why do I feel as if she didn't say that to me? You should concentrate on selling slippers... and not the ways you get beaten by them. Understood? Mummy, I will be right back. Son, you are the one who gets beaten by it. Come back and choose them for your father. I'd suggest you buy a size bigger. It's not working on him. What are you saying? Yes, Guddi. How are you? Okay. Yes, Bhupinder said that she posted a letter. There's a wedding invite in it as well. It will take some time for it to reach America. Seems like his motorcycle has broken down. His motorcycle has not broken down. His intentions have gone bad. Move aside. He will first check the plug. Yes. I too have come to buy some things for Bhupinder. Now he will open the tank. Amazing. Let's go. The shop might close down. Now he will shake it to check the petrol. Saw that? Okay, bye. I know you cannot come back from America so soon... but do write a letter to Bhupinder. She will like it. How much? Brother, try kick starting it. It works sometimes. It worked. Hey brother! Hey brother! What? Race it properly. Bullet sometimes manages to go ahead of rickshaws. Get lost. Get lost, you pervert. Sukhi! Stop! Let me get down. Where were you? I was looking at you at the shoes shop. Shoes shop? You never came back. I have been waiting for you there. I had words with him. You take this. -Give me. -Get on it. -I was waiting for you to come pick me up. -Sit quickly. Hurry up. Let's go. She didn't pay me. Go slow. It's okay. I am going slow. Today the layers aren't clear even after trying for the third time. The one who shows up on the mirror and says that the layers aren't clear... you should first go and clear things out with her. The layers of the turban will get cleared on their own. I didn't get you. Behave yourself, Sukhi. The way you acted like a roadside Romeo by following that rickshaw.. It's of no use. People from the market came to tell me about it. My motorcycle has broken down. Behave yourself. If a girl's family decides to break you down... it's not something you'll ever forget. Your sister Bholi is getting married. Leave for your mother's maternal home tomorrow. And keep the lover boy inside you in control for a few days. "A beautiful girl..." How are you, Sukhi? -Great. -Did you trap any girl or not? You trap birds. You have to love a girl and keep her in your heart. Oh really? -Yes. -You have a lot to say. I know a lot of curses too. If I start like a 90 minute cassette then we'll be spending the night here. Right? Did you record my songs? Sukhi had taken Chamkela songs. Now I'll get to hear them all night long. "A beautiful girl rejected me." "I get drunk..." How are you doing, daddy? -Sukhi? -Yes? Come here. Yes? You know Sukhi... why I came back from Germany? Yes, for us. No, wrong, incorrect. Ten years. More than ten years. I worked hard for ten years. For whom? I know, daddy. This isn't the first time you are telling me that. You came back from Germany right? when I returned after... completing my high school from mother's maternal village. You say the same thing every night from that day onwards. -"A beautiful girl..." -I'll tell you what's beautiful. You should romance like the police raids. Quietly. But I am only playing a one sided match. The other team doesn't even know whether I am playing. Tell her then. Make her know. Listen... Love, worship, faithfulness, determination and defects... They require courage. -One thing more. -Wait a minute.Let me memorize this first. Love, worship, faithfulness, determination and defects. What do they require? They require courage. -They require courage. -Sukhi. -Yes, mummy? -Go to sleep. You have to go to your uncle's place tomorrow. Okay mummy, I am coming. Okay mummy, I am going. Son, tell your uncle that we'll come once when festivities begin. Okay. Don't drink alcohol over there. One's girl, alcohol and songs always depend on your taste. -Hear that. -It's okay. Bye. "Wearing a rustic garb, I'll sit on a Bullet and keep my moustaches sharp." "Wearing a rustic garb, I'll sit on a Bullet and keep my moustaches sharp." "Let people talk." "This is how..."

"Wearing a rustic garb, I'll sit on a Bullet and keep my moustaches sharp." These painters are useless. They have tied ropes at many places and they forgot to paint. They didn't do a good job. Yes. You are right. It's okay. God sees everything. I don't know when your God will see. When they will come to ask for money, they will surely see my palm. Oh my, my brave boys are here. Did you get the wheat floured? You know us, uncle. We finish whatever we take up. -Right, Shyamu? -Yes. Go and make some tea for them. Shall I make a special drink for them... with saffron and almonds in it for these officers? Yes, that would be great. Also get something to eat. I am starving. Don't you have any shame? I had informed Siti a month ago. You two were supposed to be here yesterday. But you have come here now. Ma'am, but we got free from the Lambar's place just this morning. -Right. -Don't lie. You got free day before yesterday. They informed me. -Right, Bholi's father? -Yes. It's okay. God sees everything. Now if you two go anywhere before our daughter gets married... then I will be your worst enemy. Let me warn you. No, aunt. Siti won't go anywhere now. -Dokla, come here. -Yes. Hold this cycle and help Shyamu to unload. Okay. I'll tell Siti... what's in what and what's in what. What's in what? That's in that. That's in that. Come on. Wonderful. Very good. Welcome, nephew. Come here. I've been waiting for you. Now there will be no problems. -Bholi, dear. -Yes. Look Sukhi is here! Bholi, the brat! Sukhi, the rat! It's time to take the bat. Sukhi will bell the cat. You started right after he came. How about giving him something to eat first? -I seek your blessings, uncle. -How are you doing, nephew? I am feeling a little weak. I'll get fed good stuff here and be strong again. Some people love to swank. I had twisted your wings last time. I think you forgot, Tota(parrot). Brother, I was a little weak back then. Don't touch my tail this time. Have you got your tail transferred? Drop it, Tota. Stop blabbering. Take his bags inside. Uncle, I think I am the first one here. What did you get for me from Ludhiana? Come with me, I'll show you. Is this all you brought for me, brother? Out of this only a few things belong to you the rest is for Guddi. Oh really. Aunt has said so many things for Guddi's wedding. And Guddi won't even look at these things. It is not good to be so greedy. Mummy will get more things for you. She has spoken to the scrap dealer. I brought these from small shops. "I brought these from small shops." He thinks he is great. It's not like they adopted me. Aunt often says that she found you when she had gone to throw rubbish. -Wait, I'll show you. Wait! Stop! -Bholi! I still haven't even started cooking yet... and you are already settling the score? Keep this as an advance, Sadhu. If I take this as an advance then the final settlement will be a child's play. Actually Bholi heard what happened at Salam. A daughter's slipper washes off all your sins. And don't you dare talk to me about it. I'll hit you and break your skull open. I had once hit your father with a spatula... it had hurt him for three years. Sadhu, you... You were just a kid. You don't know. "You were just a kid!" The great confectioner, Sadhu! Sadhu, how about getting to business? You will keep fighting for the days to come. You are great. You have come alone. I am not alone. Chhotu is with me. Chhotu! Where did you fell and die? You die only once, father. Greetings! And I fell for Hema Malini. I don't know how I got stuck with you. And Dharamender took her away. I will punch you. Have you been to Bombay again? Don't mention Bombay in front of me. My body catches fire. I'll extinguish the fire! "My body catches fire." Father... Why are you embarrassing your child in front of an audience? Okay, this reminds me, we will set up the kitchen in the backyard. No, you will set up the kitchen here. Over there. Who is the confectioner, you or me? You are the confectioner, we didn't ask you to come here brew liquor. But I am shouldering all the responsibilities of this wedding. -Hence... -Do as my nephew says. Understood? I am yet to give two invites. I'll go and give them. I am anyway going to meet Seetha. This is the boundary, you wretch. Try crossing it. Then you will know what I am made up of. Tell me! Trying to act smart with me? Here, try coming here, I'll break your bones. Sukhi. Sukhi... you are safe because Sukhi has come. Otherwise, you would know what I am made up of. Coming, brother. How stupid of my father for marrying me to this bantam. How are you, Sukhi? I am fine. Tell me, have you had enough for lunch? No, I was feeling restless. That's why I was keeping myself busy with your sister-in-law. -You know.. -What Seetha is made up of. Who can ever be like you and Jagga Jatt, Seetha? Jagga Jatt died a brave death. And you shall one day get buried by sister-in-law in the courtyard. Okay, what's the day today? Day? It's Thursday. Thursday? Okay, I can drink on Thursday. -Call Chaddar. -You are too much. Chaddar! Sukhi is here! Today we will celebrate Sunday on a Thursday. Come over. Like minutes. Years went by like minutes. For you maybe, but for me every minute is like a year. You joined college and I got married. I wonder who it is. Isn't that uncle Jailu? -Yes, it's him. -Hello, uncle Jailu. Hello, son. Who is it? It's me, Khetawale Jindhar's nephew, Sukhi. Wonderful. You have come after a long time. Tell me, are you still studying or are you done? Uncle, I am in the last year of graduation. -Graduation means.. -What are you calculating? -15th grade, uncle. -What did you say? I am your mother's brother-in-law. He calls me uncle because of you. You left after doing your high school here... but everyone still calls me uncle. He is the one gave Chaddar his nickname. What else could I do? Whenever teacher asked him to sing a song... he used to sing the same song every time. "I was embroidering the bed sheet with motifs..." He made such motifs that the bed sheet tore off. What else name could we have given him? -But whatever it is, you have to hear this. -Yes. -Uncle, you have to hear this. -What? Those days are hard to forget. Sukhi, I too never forgot you. That's why you send me a letter every day. Letters will disappear. Soon there will be a system wherein here you write a letter... and there someone will get it right away. He is drunk. He has started blabbering. That reminds me, why don't you have a drink? No, I have stopped drinking. He cannot digest it. He loses my senses after getting drunk. When did I hurt you after getting drunk? -Uncle, come and have dinner. -Dinner? It will get cold. Coming, dear! Coming! -Seetha, who was that talking? -Then you'll say that I talk! Tell me once and for all how long will your nonsense continue? Do you want to have dinner or should I give it to the dogs? I'll eat on my own. You can go to sleep, Pasho! She has always skinned you alive. What else do you want her to do? -Shall we go then? -No. -Your sister-in-law will nag. -Let her, we will sing. -No. -Here we go.. Yes. I'll sing in tune. "He had gone out for 12 years, he came back with friendship..." Chhotu, work fast. What are you doing? Show some stamina. I am doing it. I cannot become food, can I? Uncle, you be in command till the wedding isn't over. Just sit on a chair and bark orders. You don't need to do unnecessary things. God bless you, nephew. If I sit, who will gather cots and mattresses for the wedding? I'll gather cots and mattresses. Anyway, it's not a wedding, till you don't gather cots and mattresses. Come. You are late. Where were you? Chaddar's scooter was running on empty tank. -On reserve. -Yes. Saying that won't fill the tank. Siti, come to the kitchen with me. I'll tell you what's in what. Quietly go away from here. Don't make me give you something else. Can't you see that she is filling water? It's okay, Shyama will fill the water. Look, the marriage broker has come. Not the marriage broker, the nonstop speaker. Careful, Daddy! There's no one like you. If I had got to do your father marriage.. -there would have been no one like you either. -Really? Your wedding will also be fixed by Daddy. -Hello, Jindhar Singh. How are you? -Good. -I know him. You are Shamsher's son. -Yes. You know you are supposed to greet? God is very miraculous. You never know who gets linked to whom and when. Come here and hold the scooter. I am known as Daddy. -Ask me why. Jindhar Singh, I met Bholi's in-laws. -Okay. They said that there will be 60 to 70 guests at the wedding. They asked me to find out if you had an objection. I said there will be no objection. Jindhar Singh has no objection. You can even get 80 guests. They have asked to serve meat during the wedding. I said we will also serve fish and liquor too. It's not a big deal. You were asking why am I called Daddy. In the village, I was the first one to call my father daddy. I called him daddy and the whole village started calling me daddy. That's why I got the whole world married but I am still single. When I was about to get married... the kids at the wedding started calling me daddy. The bride's family got suspicious. They thought that I am already married. They threw me out while I was having tea. I'll be fixing your wedding as well. I know a girl suitable for you as well from Mansa. -She flunked the eighth grade, but her family is rich. -Okay. Son, I have even got illiterate married to literate ones. I can break alliances and fix broken ones. They call me Daddy for a reason. Don't ask me again why I am called so. Let go the scooter now. Let go of it. This reminds me, Jindhar Singh they said to buy Sardahi color scooter. -Scooter? -Sardahi color is in fashion these days. As for the rest, alcohol, I have already told you. Arrange for other cold and hot drinks as well. Some don't drink alcohol. There should not be anything amiss while serving me. -How about some tea? -No, thank you. As for the rest, God will have mercy. Daddy cannot do everything. God too does some things, right? God sees everything. Okay. Chhotu! Where are you? Sadhu, you are going very slow. Do you want to me run using coal? If this continues, not even the sweets will be... ready till the time guests come. Jindhar, you don't know, when I was young I managed 15 weddings at one go. Stop bluffing. You don't know. You were just a kid back then. I was just a kid? Come in. Take one of the things inside. You are just standing there and doing your hair. Why are you carrying such a heavy thing? Your back will hurt. Take the packet of cardamoms instead. Will you manage to lift it or should I help you? -Okay, help me. -Damn you. It is not right to be so arrogant, father. If I get angry, I'll chop off both your hands... and make you the Thakur in the movie Sholay. You will get angry when you will get angry. I am already angry. If I don't make you forget your movies today, then I am not your father. Don't hit me, father. I'll call you uncle. Oh God, did I offer you raw sweets that you gave me noodle. Instead of giving birth to you, your mother should have bought a heater. It would at least provide heat during winters. Will you two just keep talking here or do some work as well? Sadhu, what happened in Salam shouldn't repeat here. What happened with your father at the fair was also bad. -His father teased a girl standing at my shop. -Okay. Then she held her under knees and forced fed him. Okay, so we know his father's story. What happened at Salam, Sadhu? -There I teased their old lady. -Shut up. You don't know. You were just a kid back then. I'll tell you what happened at Salam. Back off. I'll tell you. -We young boys went to gather cots and mattresses. -At Salam? There was no Pakistan back then. I'll come to the point. Whenever you knock at a door for cots and mattresses... you don't leave that house empty handed. You should take whatever you get. You have made your point. Now get to work. Okay. Move aside, you nitwit. Tota, the one you are whistling for has already left? But oh yes, Siti has already left. Sukhi, ask Sadhu to make Chocolate Barfi for you after we return. -Why? -He doesn't know how to. They were asked to make Chocolate Barfi at a wedding. They made a mess out of it. The groom's brothers-in-law made him sit on the ice. They said, take him away. He has melted. Tota, lift the sacks. What's so funny? Chaddar asked me to ask you if you have seen someone sitting on ice? No, I will teach this Chaddar a lesson. I am not Sadhu if I let him stay here for the wedding. It's okay, son. I'll make you go around like a top. Tota, throw the sack in and hop on. We have to go and gather cots and mattresses. We also have to pick up Seetha from the village. "Get ready, Sukhi!" "Oh, my buddies!" "We use this as an excuse to go to her house" "We knock the door and say we need cots and mattresses" Grandma, I've come from Jindhar's house. I need to take the cots and mattresses. Come in, son. Come in, boys. "Sukhi, you paint the numbers. Seetha, you count them" "It's not a wedding..." "It's not a wedding, till you don't gather cots and mattresses" "It's not a wedding, till you don't gather cots and mattresses" "It's not a wedding, till you don't gather cots and mattresses" "It's not a wedding..." Sukhi, they didn't give a bedsheet. -So what if they didn't. -Then what will we use? We will use our Chaddar instead. Sukhi, he isn't giving us any cots. Why? We have only two cots. My father and me sleep on one. My mother and my wife sleep on the other. -Look Kaleja, you are like a younger brother to us. -Okay. It's okay, if you don't want to give cots and mattresses. -But at least love properly. -Get lost. It's okay. We won't tell Kaleja about Siti. No, we won't. Why so? You can take both the cots, we will sleep on the ground... but share the secret with me. -Go and get the cots first. -I'll go and get it. It's not a problem. Write Kaleja's name. Sukhi, how many more do we need? We will manage with whatever we get. Those who don't get cots, we will get them drunk and pile over. Here you go, this is what they gave. The same cot and mattress had come for my wedding as well. When it came, my father said... Seetha, the same had come at my wedding as well. -Okay. I'll return it if you say so. -No. It's a historic cot. We have to make brother-in-law from Nabhe lie somewhere too. That would be great. Tota, the cot is walking! No, Seetha is walking under it. How many times have I told you not to make him carry a cot all by himself. -Who will be responsible if he gets crushed under it? -Give it to me. Sukhi, at least don't say such things in front of my wife. Why are you ruining my reputation? You too love to get insulted, don't you? Brother-in-law, this cot and mattresses came from my maternal home... don't give it to someone infested with lice. Seetha said you had brought only abuses as dowry, no cots. Stop your nonsense! Don't listen to him. Who needs enemies if one has friends like you? You go and cook dinner. Start driving, Sukhi. Come home in the evening and I'll tell you what you got in dowry. -You start driving. -We are not in a hurry. We too should know what sister-in-law brought as dowry. Shall I make you a list? I'll tell you at night, just wait. "She is a spitfire! He'll have to risk it" "She is a spitfire! He'll have to risk it" "A trouble named Gudiya will open the door" "Their new blanket was lost, Meeta!" "It's not a wedding, till you don't gather cots and mattresses" "It's not a wedding, till you don't gather cots and mattresses" "It's not a wedding, till you don't gather cots and mattresse." "It's not a wedding..." Okay, get down. Sukhi, let's skip Jailu's house. His mother is very rude. The other day I said, I seek your blessings, grandma... -She said go ahead, there isn't anyone at home. -Really? Jailu is your uncle's best friend. But you won't get any cots and mattresses from here. What are you saying? Didn't Sadhu say that you shouldn't return... empty handed from the house were you seek cots and mattresses. I'll go inside. Go on. You'll meet the same fate Sadhu had. -It's okay you go. -He will get himself insulted. -"I get drunk" -She's sitting over there. I seek your blessings, grandma. Go ahead, there isn't anyone at home. I am from Jindhar Khetawale's house. I need cots and mattresses. My sister Bholi is getting married. You can take one when Jailu returns. You anyway have a trolley full of them. What will you do with so many of them? I'll talk to uncle Jailu. Tell him that Sukhi had come, he took it. But I told you no one is at home. Why are you going inside? Soon you would want something else from this house. This one is good. I'll take this one. Don't touch the cot. Keep it down. Didn't you hear me? I said don't touch cot. Why? Does it gives electric shock to people? Keep it down. Granny asked you to come later yet you just walked inside shamelessly. Neither uncle nor aunt is at home. Why did you lift the cot without permission? Okay, I'll take your permission and then lift it. I am taking the cot. Give me a mattress to go along with it. Keep the cot down. If you want to take one, take that one. This one? It's for the relatives and not to dry snacks over it. And then it won't look good if I take the bad one in your presence. As the elders say... what did you say your name was? I didn't tell you my name. No problem. As the elders say... You shouldn't let go of something you really like. Forget it. I'll remember it like the multiples of two. This is the one I'll take along. It's my sister Bholi's wedding. It's not a small event. You are Bholi's brother? Bhupinder is my friend. She doesn't have a brother, you liar. Oh, I am her aunt's son from Phunkhala. I study at Ludhiana. I kept following you. But you don't even recognize me. This roadside Romeo won't stop following me. Now he will follow me even during the wedding. Have you thought of something about me? You don't need to think twice. Get a great mattress, just like you. I am a mattress? No, you are great. I'll give it to you because you are Bholi's brother. Otherwise, I won't even let someone like you go past my house. Great timing to get the mattress. Take this. And listen carefully. Better make a good guest sleep on this cot and mattress. Understood? Who can be better than me? I am the best guest. Now that's one beautiful damsel. When she walks... it feels like the barren thirsty land has been blessed with rain. Both your attitude and anger are acceptable. I feel happy when I think about you. Here. -Are they good? -Yes So, make me a beautiful snack. A spicy one, a hot one. A fireball. I have seen it a number of times... this snack. I recognized it. My name is Sukhchan, Sukhchan Gareya. If someone wants, she/he can affectionately call me Sukhi. Whoever you are, brother, there's no snacks left. You weren't fated to have it. Really? Ask if anyone is ready to share. We will split it into two. I told you, you weren't fated to have it. I am fated to have the moon. "Oh my beautiful beloved, your love has shown its color" "My heart beats to your name" "In my every breath is your name" "I feel you inside me..." "I swear upon God" "My desires are soaring high, love" "I am dreaming about you" "May you get my share of life too" "This is what I always pray for" "You make me intoxicated, love" "You make me..." "You really make me..." "You do make me intoxicated, love" "You make me intoxicated, love" "Oh, don't..." "Please don't..." "Please don't get out of my sight, love" "Oh your expressive eyes..." "Make the lovers lose their mind" "Oh your expressive eyes..." "Make the lovers lose their mind" "When I look into your eyes..." "I drown in them" "When I look into your eyes I drown in them" "I am sure you cast a spell with them" "Oh, don't..." "Please don't..." "Please don't get out of my sight, love" "Your heart is a garden of roses" "That is why your each word is fragrant" "Your heart is a garden of roses" "That is why your each word is fragrant" "Let me keep looking at you" "Let me feel your love" "Let me keep looking at you. Let me feel your love" "I swear you are a sight of heaven" "Oh, don't..." "Please don't..." "Please don't get out of my sight, love" "Don't you ever leave me" "Don't you ever leave me" "Don't you ever leave me" -Father... -Yes. -The milk is exposed. -Do you want it to wear knickers? -He talks nonsense. -Uncle, we have brought the cots and mattresses. Well done, nephew. You have done a great job by getting these cots and mattresses. This is the most difficult task. Keep it down. Keep it down right away. No one will touch this cot. Why? Does it give electric shocks? It doesn't. But I'll surely slap the one who touches it. Shall we make more Jalebis? Stop making Jalebis. Make sure that you make Chocolate Barfi. Stupid of him. Who demands Chocolate Barfi in a village? Only cities want it. -Aren't I right, Chhotu? -No one eats it. Everyone eats it. The groom's family has made a special demand. -Right, Sukhi. -They told you, Tota, the great man. Siti, make some tea. Why, what is wrong with your hands? Why don't you make it? Can't you see that she is washing utensils? You wash the utensils. Make some more tea. I too want to drink some. Okay, I am here. Tell me if you want any work to be done. -You do one thing. -What? -Sit on this wall. -Okay. And scare the crows away. We asked you to scare crows away, not Tota. Tota will fly away with Siti. Don't make me break your peck. Give me records of all cots and mattresses. I'll keep it safe. Hello, everyone, please listen to me. Hello, everyone! Please listen to me. I don't want any commotion. I want everything to run smoothly. Do you understand or shall I explain? How are you, Sintal. Why are you causing a commotion? Seetha, get this straight. Be polite with me. Got it? Here, I am your brother-in-law. Don't try to act smart in front of your buddies, got it? Do you understand or shall I explain? Yes, don't address him as Sintal. I agree that your mother's maternal home was neighboring his. Here no one will address him as Sintal. I will be their worst enemy. -Right, Sintal? I mean brother-in-law? -Sukhi! You are telling everyone, man! You better cover the Jalebis before they get infested. We will give you other things to cover. You first make Chocolate Barfi. There are still a lot of things to be made. Shall we call for ice? Why are you talking about ice, we are talking about Barfi here. Chaddar, do me a favor get the equipments from the cot, I need them. Chaddar, the speaker installer isn't here as yet! I wonder where he is! Chaddar, get me some snacks. I'll have a drink and get into the mood. Also get some wood. Chaddar, get me spice box from there. Chaddar! Go and get the drums from the Gurudwara. Chaddar, help me with this work. I'll teach everyone a lesson. Brother Chaddar, also tell all families to come to dance. Don't forget to go to uncle Jailu's house. Ranjeet, my friend, uncle Jailu's niece... Tell her Bhupinder will get upset if she doesn't show up. He won't be doing so many things anyway. He will get the drums. -I'll pass your message to Ranjeet. -Okay, brother. Why are you all staring at me? Okay, we will both go there. You set the cots. "We will both go there!" Who will do all the work, our brother-in-law from Nabhe? Did you say something to me? Yes, brother-in-law. They are all shying away from work. Make sure they work. Why aren't you all working? Have you come from Bombay? Don't mention Bombay in front of me. My body catches fire. Grandma, I'll seek blessings if anyone is at home. Again you came? I'll keep coming now. Hello, aunt. -Bless you. -Hey, hello. Such a friendly girl! He's who? Who is she? -She is our niece Rano. -Rano! -But who are you? -You didn't recognize me? I am Sukhi, Sukhchan Gareya. Khetawale Jindhar's nephew Phunkhala. Oh come on. I am the only child of my parents. Oh great. I hadn't recognized you. I didn't recognize you either. You were this small when I last saw you. No, no, no, grandma. Make me at least a little bigger. With God's grace, you look good. I was fed at my mother's maternal place. Rano, I attended high school over here. -What am I supposed to do? -Get ready. Bholi has sent me to pick you up for dance. She was upset. She said my friend Ranjeet still hasn't showed up. Get her urgently. Urgent means quickly. Get ready. I'll take you along. You have come on a plane? They will come with Jailu. Don't mind her, son. She is crazy. You two go inside and get ready quickly. Go inside. -Hello, uncle Jailu. -Hello. You don't know. You are still young. I used to go to Canada and America on cycle and make sweets there. Stop it. Don't lie. There are seas and mountains on the way. How can you go there on a cycle? Seas and mountains have been made recently. I am talking about olden times. -Tell me something. -What? How old are you? You can estimate by the fact that the lemons were just discovered. Hey, he belongs to a time before herbs were discovered. -Kalja. -No, I am Kaleja. Your mother's... Are you making Ladoos or squeezing them? Our relatives will be eating them and not playing with them. -This is how my hands move. -Like this. Stop showing off, oh great confectioner. You don't know how great confectioner I am. God has blessed me with great skills. Even my boils look like candies. -So what is my fault? -It's your mother's fault. She gave birth to such a buffoon. You too come out. What are you doing, digging a well? All is looking good, uncle. No, it isn't. This is just window dressing. I am ruined from within. My son had passed away. Then my sister and her husband passed away. Rano has just cleared high school. Then we brought her here. What am I talking about? Tell me, what would you like to drink or eat? Why are you offering him anything? He isn't a guest. He has a wedding take place at home. I am sure he is must have had something. -Well... -Let's go son, we are ready. If you want to talk to him then we will go on foot. No, uncle Jailu will come there anyway. We can talk over there. Bholi has given me special duty to take you there. Let's go, dear. Let's go. I have my motorcycle with me. Come on. Aunt, I'd suggest you sit at the back. If the girl falls over then both you and I'll have to live in guilt. Okay. Rano, you sit in the middle. I, anyway, won't be able to sit in the middle. -How can I, aunt? -Sit down. -It's okay. You should listen to your elders. Right? -Come on, dear. You will manage to adjust. Do you know what adjust means? Adjust means adjust. Bye, uncle Jailu. Surila. Surila. He is here! Surila greets everyone affectionately. Welcome, Surila. I am already in. How much further do you wish me to go? Someone tell Jindhar Singh that Surila is here. The speaker installer. -God bless you, son. God bless you. -I am just lifting the wood. Take them. Where is Mr. Jindhar? During a wedding, you'll find the confectioner at his place. Otherwise, you never know where others are. But I've heard that the confectioners are placed on ice if he errs. Don't misbehave! Let me warn you! When have you ever seen me on my back? -Look at him! Idiot! -Wonderful.You brought the speakers? They will come. I first need to find out where I have to place them. Tell me, do you want religious songs or peppy numbers or mix? I have one more another question. Are all the guests educated or illiterate? Are you here to install speakers or to conduct a survey? You are asking so many questions! If you want to ask so many questions then you may leave. Understood. What did you understand? That you will like peppy numbers. Peppy numbers! Dokla, where is Siti? Go find her. There are a lot of dirty utensils in the kitchen. Who will do all the work? Where is Siti? Where can she go, uncle? She must be getting dressed somewhere. It's okay. I'll go and check. Okay. -Dokla. -Yes. You better keep Siti in your control or someone else might take her away. You don't know about such things. You are still a kid. How can anyone take her away? Just like you eloped with her, someone else might also do the same. It was love at first sight. She kicked her family away. She doesn't have polio now that she cannot kick someone else. -Mind your tongue. -I am minding it but it is not working. Okay. -Well done, son. -Take care of this. Black cardamoms, mugs and baking soda. Give me. Well done, son. Now go and get silver foil and cumin seeds as well. It will only take a minute. Go and get it. Also, get garam masala. Fly away. I'll teach him how to make Chocolate Barfi. Rano, please scooch a little or aunt will fall. No need, son. I won't fall. Aunt, you sometimes know only after you fall down. Stop it! Kumbhkarana used to eat food meant for 20 villages. Imagine the manure he produced when he went to relieve himself! -Look over there. -Come, dear. -Hello. -Hello. -Son, you did a good thing... -Hello. ...you brought the ladies along. When you start seeing and talking a lot... it means that your end days are closer. -That is right. -You are right. You just prepare the Chocolate Barfi. Otherwise, you are fated to be on ice. -And he scored. -Sukhi! I think you are taking way too responsibilities. -Spare some time to meet your father as well. -Hello, father. -Bless you. -When did you come? When you were carrying passengers in a snail paced ride... our jeep raced passed it. I have stopped speeding on my motorcycle. Yeah, sure. You have speeded up something else. -Yes. -Yes. Where's our mummy? Not ours, she is your mummy. Where is she? -My son Sukhchan is during the final year of graduation. -Okay. My niece will be in the final year next year. She studies in Khalsa College, Patiala. Aunt, I am a part of the female dance team. A term cannot be formed in college without me. Right, a term cannot be formed without you. You are so modest! Mummy! You came a day earlier? Were you worried that aunt will fall short of Ladoos? Look at that, my son is so funny. He cannot be as funny as I am. I am Pinky. -Hello. I am Sukhi. -Hello. She is my aunt. And she is my mother. She is my sister-in-law. The one standing back there with a plate full of Ladoos is my brother. -He is my uncle. -Did we leave out anyone? Where do you study? That depends. It's sometimes on the terrace and sometimes in the bus. But mummy knows that I don't study much. I am being considerate because of your old age. Otherwise, I would have burning you under wood. -At least come out of the egg first. -Damn! I have more year's experience catering than your age. -You can ask anyone. -Let it be, Chaddar. Why are you arguing with a crazy man? I was crazy about your mother too. Don't talk about my mother. I will hit you. -You don't know. You were a kid back then. -I won't make Ladoos for you. -I'll strangle you. -Why are you bothering, Chaddar? It is Bholi's wedding. No one is supposed to fight. Will he fight? He isn't Dara Singh. What happened? What's all this commotion about? What kind of a person have you given to help me? He is a useless guy. Have you sorted it out or should I get a stick? Both father and son are after my blood. You won't fall short even if we have a few bottles of your blood. No sister-in-law, a stick won't do him any harm. Sit on him and just crush him. You wait right there, I'll teach you a lesson. how much you talk! Don't make me slap you. Can't you give me the whole list at once? You made me go there four times. I come in later, he starts barking go and get this. Son, you cannot make do without confectioners. Your father is still to die. No one will bother seeking you in near future. They will sell readymade sweets. Weddings won't take place at home. -There will be palaces. -Stop making predictions. What do you think you are, a fortuneteller? Attitude and ego ruin the fun of life. If your heart is filled with sweetness, you don't need Ladoos. Brother Sukhi, I don't understand. We weren't discussing Ladoos. You never understand anything. Sadhu, whatever you want, ask for it affectionately and you will get it. Now should I give him a kiss and send him to the market? Like muah, go and get silver foil for the Barfi. -Did you made the Chocolate Barfi? -I have made something better. We don't want anything else. We want Chocolate Barfi. If you don't give it then you better watch out. We will make run in torn knickers. Don't make us do what they did to you at Salam. They got him on the day of the wedding. We will handle him a day before the wedding. Call for ice. Why, you want to place your dead body on it? You are right. Okay, God sees everything. Well done, Surila. Now fix the speakers on the terrace. The speakers get fixed on the terrace. -Have you heard anyone fixing it on a tap? -I have seen it as well. The speaker installer in our village also said the same. We tied him to a tap and fixed a speaker on his ear. That makes me wonder if you placed the speaker on his ear... then they will get covered so how would he hear the music? -Hence I say that... -I say you fix it whenever you want. Where did you get him from, uncle? Jindhar, you are going to play songs. Won't this disturb the prayers? Sadhu, we did the prayers a week back at the Gurudwara. -Good thing. -We are having a wedding here. We can make a thousand mistakes while attending to the guests. -Pick that up, come on. -Hey speaker master. -Yes. -Play Hindi songs. Why Hindi songs? I am not from Bombay. Don't mention Bombay in front of me. My body catches fire. "Oh mother, she caused a scene!" "Oh mother, she caused a scene!" "Oh mother, she caused a scene!" "Oh mother, she caused a scene!" "Oh mother, she caused a scene!" Do ladies need anything to eat. Do you need to even ask, brother? Get whatever you want. They will eat anything. -Tota. -Yes, brother? Get some fritters and ask Siti to serve tea. Siti won't serve anything. You will have to do that. I feel like breaking Siti's leg, lazy girl. Why are you breaking her legs, aunt? I am here for you. Sit down, Siti. Mummy, you look very beautiful when you place your veil behind your ears. Come on, get up. You aren't here making sweets or anything. Get up. -Surila... -Yes? Give me a foot massage. One day I will strangle you. I will ask Chhotu. -Get up, Chhotu. -I won't. -Get up, son. -Why? -Your mother passed away. -Good. I swear, I have nothing to do with that. Stop your nonsense. Play a nice song. Start singing. -"The poor..." -Stop the music. Let the girls dance. What? What did you say? Should I increase the volume? We cannot hear ourselves out here. Okay, don't worry. I'll increase it to full volume. -Full! -Stop the music! I'll hit you with my slipper. Stop it. -Stop the music! -Stop the music! Stop it. Why are you causing uproar? I cause uproar everywhere. Whether it's for them or for you. Okay, I will stop it. -Will you stop it now? -He stopped it. -He stopped it. -Come on girls, sing. "It is an auspicious occasion" "It is an auspicious occasion" "It is an auspicious occasion" "Don't keep talking about your in-laws" "There is no place as good as this" "Wonderful!" "You have changed after going to your in-laws' place." Oh my angel, meet me at the cattle pen at 4:00am. I don't like this. -Why? -First you came here quite late. Then you didn't even have a drink. Don't worry. We will get together some other time. Today is the death anniversary of our elder. -Sukhi! Come here. -Yes. -Call Shindo. -You're leaving already? He says he wants to leave. But they are still at it. I'll drop them home. It's not a problem but we have to get up early because of the animals. -Okay. -Please go and call them. Come. Very good. Get the rest of the things inside, son. Come on. Very good. Here, hold the horse's reins. People hand over a girl. And you are giving me a horse, Dongra? Are you blind? I am sitting on the horse. Once you hold the horse's reins, you can take me anywhere. I gave you the horse's reins to guide it and not so that you can marry Rano. You should stop thinking about Rano. I have already fixed her marriage. Say that you are lying. Okay, come on. I have never managed to remove the rope... as fast as it removed the cover. It removed the cover? Oh no! The calf is so smart? It removed the cover and hung it on the nail? She came to meet me? Do you want something? Idiot! Damn you! She gave me something instead! What happened, son? You got up so early? Did you go to take your bike for a bathroom break? It is some cattle that I will take it for a bathroom break. Anyway, what's your problem? What problem can I have? When early in the morning you see someone... stealthily dragging a bike which starts on first kick, then you are bound to be worried. Sadhu, you should instead worry about... getting hit left and right then you will yearn to go to bathroom... like a diabetic yearns for sweets. -Understood? -It's okay, son. You will know when you get caught. -Kaleja. -Yes? Boys say that there was a frog in the milk you brought yesterday. He brings milk. What else did you expect, elephants? Shut up. Surila, boys were saying that you have only old records. Don't worry, I'll buy new records. Some boys also said that you don't know how to make Barfi. He keeps making some pre-independence old Barfi. I said don't worry. I will ask him to make Chocolate Barfi. He'll make Chocolate Barfi? Shut up! Go and get green chilies. Go. I don't know how many to get. It's not meat we are talking about. Go and get a handful of them. -Come along with me. -Let's go. I'll go and do a few of my pending work as well. Let's go. Wait. Don't fall. Don't break anything. Wait, let me sit behind you, then you can start driving. An old woman approached Sadhu once. She asked do you have any Puri-Paaris? He said, I won't have any Puris (fried bread).. ...you can take Paaris (kisses) instead. Sukhi, I left Sadhu at the market while coming back. I made him push the scooter twice on the way there. Well done. Hello, uncle Jailu. Hello. -This is great. -Hello. God bless you. What great thing did he do? Pulled a train with his teeth? Grandma, I meant it's a responsible thing to come on time. Hello! Welcome! -Hello! -I am so happy that you came, Shindo. -There is a lot of work that needs to be done. -Hello, aunt. -Where is your father? -He is waiting for you on the terrace. -Let's go, dear. -Grandma, I have some work for you as well today. The wok is kept on fire. The cook is no good. -You will have to check the salt and sugar. -Okay. -Seethe. -Yes. Take her along. -Now, I'll go and handle everything. -Come grandma. You give me this. It is your friend's wedding. You too should be given some responsibilities. I was waiting for you at night. You didn't show up. What is this? What you did to me was wrong. Hello! Listen to me. You are only interested in taking the letter? You didn't intend to show up? The one who got the letter must have waited for you. What? What what? Some people only like to give letters and have no intend to show up. What? What what? It's either what, why or how? Be careful that I give you respect because of... the education my parents gave me. If I get angry, it won't take me long to curse you. That's enough, dear. I just wanted to check do you have any pride left in you or not. Come on, my love. Get to work now. Can you tell me where's my red shirt? Outside, on the stand. What the hell! This is bad. Hey girl, did you remove the shirt from the stand? I hope he doesn't get hold of the letter. -Do you guys call it a shirt? -Guddi! -This is true. -Right. Absolutely? Sir, tea and Ladoos. Very good. Tea and Ladoos. You are serving him eggs, chickens... I'll tell you, once I saw someone get beaten up at the railway station. A man was selling snacks. He kept saying serving hot. A girl passed by. He said serving hot girl. She grabbed him and told him I'll tell you how hot I am. She must have shown her hotness by hitting him with her sandals. This is great. Sukhi? -What are you looking at? -Your mother. -You too, Sukhi? -Get lost! I'll tell you! Come with me. -Now tell me. -What? Will this stand tell if you don't tell where my red shirt is? -I had hanged it over here. -Then did the ground swallow it? Has anyone seen my red shirt? Well known singers beg me, they plead me. "Surila, please play my song." Don't tell anyone. Keep it to yourself. Mohammed Sadeek and Manik became hit because of me. -Really? -Yes, then what! And how many lost work because of you? Tell them that as well. Tell them where all you got hit by sandals for playing dirty songs. Look, I was never hit by sandals. But yes, I was beaten up a year ago for the dirty songs. Then I washed the cassette and the songs became clean. Then people started giving me a lot of respect. Everyone respected me. But Sadhu Singh, people say that if you keep... ice in your hand for two minutes then your hands go numb. They made you sit on the ice. How did you feel back then? Damn, Chaddar. He has ruined my name. He is troubling me. He made me get down from the scooter and came back here. My feet got blistered with all that working. Only blistered? He had said he would break your legs too. Tell me, who are you supporting me or Chaddar? Look, I have to face God, so I won't lie. I am supporting Chaddar. I'll call Chaddar. He'll apply a balm on your legs. Lie down. I'll massage your legs. No need! Go and do the dishes. I'll handle him. Handle me, what do you think I am? I had once handled the grocer. Chhotu was just a kid back then. What happened was.. -Tota! -Yes? You too serve this great sage. Uncle Jindhar, get a glass of milk for uncle Sadhu. -With some turmeric in it. -Do you guys want me dead? Have you forgotten the days when as a kid... you used to come to me and ask for Barfi? I am all grown up now. And I still ask for Barfi. But Chocolate Barfi. Shyama, go and help them with the tent. Brother Sukhi, but they have already brought help with them. What will I do over there? I want to work here. Brother Sukhi, there is no sight of Chocolate Barfi as yet. Then I think you will be going empty handed from here, Sadhu. It will be embarrassing for us if he goes empty handed. We will send him in torn knickers. Chaddar, please keep me out of this. Father, please make the Chocolate Barfi. Even if you make it like you made at Salam. I'll give you a piece of it. Let me know if it's sweet enough. It's a little less. Add another ladle full of it. -You... -Now, okay. Sukhi! Brother-in-law is asking for you. From where did Jindhar found such a lanky son-in-law? You don't know, Surila. Let me tell you. He wasn't lanky, he was rather healthy. You know he has a habit of wiping his noses. -He keeps snorting. -Yes. -Once he was spraying on wheat fields. -Okay. He bymistake wiped his nose with the spray pipe. How did this happened! I shrank! I am ruined! Then they found him laying like a piece of dried cotton in the field. I'll go and help Siti with the sheets. I know how to spread the sheets better. Do you understand, Tota? I have spread many sheets and people too. Come with me. Shyama, go with him. Okay, now the sheets have become heavy? Like this cloth was leeching on to Shyama... there are many people leeching on the others. The day I get an opportunity I'll... What do you mean, I should now beg like a beggar... Give me my shirt back, for God's sake. This looks like my shirt. -Wear some other shirt, brother-in-law. -Won't that ruin my style? Today, you will get to see Sukhi Jatt's style... when he'll wear a yellow turban, white shirt and red jacket. Everyone will only look at him in awe. Seetha, why are you telling everything to brother-in-law? He will copy my style. Sukhi, you won't wear those clothes. Do you understand or shall I explain? It is mine. -It's yours? -Yes. Take it. I anyway can't read it. Brother Sukhi! Please read this letter for me. -Please read this letter for me. -No. Siti threw it towards me. Siti threw it? Then listen what Siti has to say. -Siti writes: -Yes? -Dear Tota... -Oh my. I give you a lot of... What's that? It's sugar-free sweet, Tota. -Okay. -There's more. -I wish to eat sweet flatbread with you. -Oh my. Once all the singing and dancing is over at night... meet me at the cattle pen. We will talk about love. Oh my. Oh my, love gives a different high. -Give me that letter. -No. Lovers shouldn't be in position of such letters. You might get into trouble. Coming Siti. Sukhi! Go and check on the progress of the tent outside. Uncle, you are sitting like a commander. There is a wedding taking place here. You should be all over the place. You too should take up some responsibility. This is just too much! Rano! Rano! Bholi has sent a list for you. Take it. Read it careful. Take it. -Tell me.. -Don't say anything about my mother. Then the topic is over? Let me know unhesitatingly... if you want me to play a romantic song for someone special. I unhesitatingly hit people as well. I understood. Then I'll play the brother-sister song. Sukhi, you better talk to Chaddar. He is troubling me a lot these days. Tell him that I am old and I know more tricks than you guys. I have a bad temper too. -How bad? -Worse than your face. You have been cleaning the record... so you might as well clean your face too. And tell Chaddar that if he raises his hand on me... then I'll hit where it hurts. I'll tell you something. I had gone to meet Chhotu's mother before our wedding. She came to meet me. When I held her hand, she slapped me. -Then? -Then what? I too slapped her. She told me Sadhu Nath, we will make a good match. Sadhu! Listen carefully. I'll break your face and Chhotu's stomach../ -if you don't do your job properly. - Right. If aunt gets angry, you'll get blown away like a bag does during a storm. Aunt, I told him to make Chocolate Barfi four days back. There are still no signs of Chocolate Barfi. Damn you, why didn't you make the Colgate Barfi? She wants to brush her teeth with the Barfi? Tell me. Why aren't you saying anything? Brother, you keep taking plates full of sweets to sister-in-law. She won't fit into her clothes on the last day. She troubles me if I don't get them for her. And then you are ordering me here. This is great! This is a limit! I have been looking for it on the terrace... and you have kept the box of liquor bottles out here in the open. That too so close to Sadhu. No one respects alcohol out here. Get this straight as well, Sadhu. If there is anything lacking in the food for the girls tonight and tomorrow... then I'll be your worst enemy, let me tell you. You will feel worse than a donkey working in the field. Do you understand? Hear them talk! I wonder what everyone had eaten. They are very bitter. I think your mother too had chilies before giving birth to you. This Barfi is bland. There is no taste in it. This isn't Barfi, it's cottage cheese, old woman. Who knows what will happen or what will not happen. But these questions sound very good. Do I love you? Do you like me? I want to meet you to know the answers to these questions. Don't misunderstand me. I'll come to meet you at 12, at the cattle pen. Please do come. Waiting for you, Sukhi Have you lost your mind? You don't feel shy writing letter, do you? What do you think of yourself? You will fix a time for our meeting? No, don't misunderstand me. I like you a lot. I am crazy not just about your face but your nature as well. Nowadays, I spend my days thinking about you. Don't make tall claims. I don't think about you at all. Okay, if you don't then why have you come here? I have come here to tell you that I don't have any feelings for you. And uncle will be here soon. Don't get yourself beaten up unnecessarily. Do you understand? Hello! How dare you touch me! She slapped me! Then I too slapped her. She told me Sadhu Nath, we will make a good match. What was Sukhi doing upstairs? Hello, what are you doing here? I was looking for you over there. What's in that bag? No, it's just... Okay, Barfi, Gulam Jamun. So you are gathering sweets. No, brother. It's for your sister-in-law Pasho. I mean.. You ugly face, don't you have any shame? I'll slap you. No, sister-in-law. Don't slap him. Girls have very strong hands these days. Take this. I am leaving. Where are you going? Wait a minute. You are covered in husk and you came from up there. Go and make tea. I'll talk to him. Come. -Come upstairs with me. -Seetha, I want my turban... I'll tell you how to starch your turban. I doubted it. But I didn't know that things have gone so far. You have crossed all limits with all that slapping. She thinks too much of herself. Calm down. Rano addresses me as brother. Uncle Jailu has given me the responsibility to look after her. Do you think I am fooling around? I want to marry Rano. Seetha, if you help me out in this then I swear, I'll never forget your favor. It's not a big deal anyway. But you have made the girl go against you by slapping her. I will convince her. Then I convince uncle Jailu. But what if your father refuses? No way. Uncle Jailu and my father are very good friends. Okay then, you convince Rano. Okay. Here's the gram flour. -Dokla. -Yes? What are you doing here? Your Siti is romancing with someone else. Mind your tongue. I'll mind my tongue. You should go and mind your wife. I cannot see Tota anywhere. He is standing next to Siti. I suggest two smacks on the knees. No one will notice in the commotion of the wedding. Who are you romancing hiding out here? Damn you! You scoundrel! I'll teach you a lesson. You ate my share of rice! you scoundrel! You think you are some Romeo! I beg of you. I have some respect in this village. Don't ruin it. Take it. Give me two more Ladoos, son. Okay. -Aunt, do you remember. -What? When I was small, you had once slapped me. I too had slapped you back. But when I said sorry, you forgave me immediately. When did you ever slap me? If you had slapped me, I would have broken your neck. You get beaten up every day. Stop lying. Hey girl... I will go and ask Sukhi's aunt... -how much sweets should we give to her maternal family. -Okay. Dear, you put sweets in these bags. I'll be right back, okay? -Okay. -Sukhi, help her. Are you still angry over that slap? Here, throw this Ladoo shaped by Kaleja and vent out your anger. Do it! Do it! Do it. Surila, does your music system work fine? His music system burns reels. This man is looting in his own sister's house. He eats a lot. He ate half the vegetable cooked. -He doesn't eat. His wife hogs. -Okay. Women have even made sages their slaves. -So what can he do? -Right. Dokla, I cannot see Tota. Where is he? Where can he go? He must be here somewhere. Dokla. Surila. It is tasty. Play that song from Sholay.. When a girl gets angry, she looks even more beautiful. She got angry already? I think I'll have to teach you a lesson too. Here, give me two glasses of special drink. No, that drink is only for the special wedding guests. It is not for any ordinary person. I am the eldest son of the eldest son-in-law of this family. Quietly give it to me. It is for my parents. You brought for both of us? Yes, mother has put me on special duty. I have to take special care of Bholi and her friends. I said I understand that Bholi is my sister... but what if one of her friends gets angry and slaps me? Then you slap her back. I will. But then she won't forget me. -Right? -I'll forgive you right away. Well, you will forgive me even if I don't make a mistake. Here, drink it. You have been eyeing it from quite some time. Here. Okay, so he is romancing Jindhar's niece. Damn that Sadhu is staring at me as... if he has never seen a beautiful girl before. Okay, so this is what he is up to? Damn you! There is so much work left to be done! -Who will do it? Your father! -No aunt! I am not hiding. -Don't hit me, aunt. -You are hiding over here! You lazy fellow! Who will do all the work? You are hiding over here! I know everything! I know what you are up to! Wait, I'll break your bones! You just wait! One can make a mistake sometimes. You slapped once. I slapped once. We are quits. What are you doing, Sukhi? I am rehearing for Jagoo, mother. Jagoo is here! Jagoo is here! I don't know, you are a fool. I want to marry you. Sukhi, my uncle has already fixed my marriage with someone in Ahmedghad. Sometimes God doesn't want what the heart wants. "It wasn't her fault" "It wasn't my fault" "Then tell me, why did you separate us?" "It wasn't her fault" "It wasn't my fault" "Then tell me, why did you separate us?" "Our desires..." "Our desires..." "Why did You drown them in tears?" "Oh God, why did you break two hearts?" "Oh God, why did you break two hearts?" "Oh God, why did you break two hearts?" "Oh my beloved!" "She didn't try to go away from me" "Why couldn't you see us happy together?" "She didn't try to go away from me." "Why couldn't you see us happy together?" "Why did you..." "Why did you drown our love in sorrows?" "Oh God, why did you break two hearts?" "Oh God, why did you break two hearts?" "Oh God, why did you break two hearts?" Rano, you? What happened? Why are you crying? After the wedding, you will go very far away from me. I started crying thinking about that. No, Rano. Stop crying. Sukhi, this is like the instrument breaks before you even start the sing. Anyway, we shouldn't get shots if there is no fever. What do you mean? It's not like you were dating her. I mean it was one-sided love, right? She did say anything. No buddy, she told me about her marriage. This shows that she isn't happy with that alliance. I think she has some feelings for me. But you too are right. She is already engaged, what can we do? We cannot do anything. Why can't we do anything? You should do at least something sometimes. We can do something but... a relationship isn't glass that we can break with a stone. We can break it. Why can't we break it? -Why can't we break it? -Yes, we can break it. But it is not so easy. -I'll think of something. -Let's go. What let's go. I'll go outside and think. You sit here and use your tiny little brain. My son is acting like a Romeo these days. Come here. No father, it's not so. I am your father. I treat you like a friend. When words hurt instead of giving pleasure... then you should assume that the youth is in trouble. Father, sometimes people who are walking on the right path... have to face the sign of road closed ahead. Sukhi, sometimes life makes you stand on crossroads... where you have plenty of options but you don't know which is the right one. If your soul is pure and your intentions are good... then you end up finding the right path to fulfill your desire. I had told you something. Love, worship, faithfulness, determination and defects... they require courage. -Do you remember? -Yes, I remember. But back then you didn't let me complete what I was saying. You had interrupted me. One thing more.. Laziness can never get rid of trouble. And ego can never fulfill a dream. So, if you have a desire and you believe in yourself... then don't lose courage, my friend. Happiness will welcome you. -Don't lose courage. -Okay, father. Now I won't lose courage. I'll get going. -Don't lose courage. -Okay. Don't make me break your bones before I break Rano's alliance. What made you think you can lay on Rano's cot? I didn't think. I laid here to think. Today you too will know what Seetha is made up of. My dear, I was thinking that we could somehow involve Daddy... and get you and Rano married. Daddy? Who is Daddy? The nonstop middleman. I can break alliances and fix broken ones. They call me Daddy for a reason. I know them quite well. I can get your job done in no time. In no time! But the way you have approached me.. It will cost you. As soon as I talk to Jailu about your match... I want you to give me 2100 rupees and a gold ring. It's difficult? Okay, no problem. I will not take 2100 rupees, but you'll have to give me a ring. Well, consider your job done. You should leave now. -Go, go, go. -Okay. Go, go. Buddy, can I say something? I know a lover when I see one. Go, I won't even take a ring from you. Do you know why? I am known as Daddy. I have got such an urgent piece of news that I came as soon as I could. Now I've even got a stamp of approval from the American Embassy. But you guys don't value me. You've incurred a huge loss by fixing your son's marriage... with Jailu's niece. What does Jailu have? He is pauper. I have a good match. The girl is from America. They are giving you a car. And they are giving 125,000 rupees cash to the groom. And don't talk about gold. They do business of gold in America. They said they'd give sandals made of gold to the groom's mother. And you wear size 12. It will take a lot of gold, right? If you still wish to get him married there then go ahead. Why should I bother? Go and have cauliflower fritters at the wedding. I will give goat meat and fish fritters to someone else. Why should I be concerned? Why are you standing, Daddy? Please have a seat. Stand up! Keep the tea down and stand up! I'll give you a plane! You have such big demands! You should first be worthy of making such demands! Why don't you just say that you have found another match? You have come here to break the alliance with Rano. Get this straight. Rano is my daughter. You won't find another girl like Rano. -You are misunderstanding. -Enough! That is enough! Before I do anything wrong, you better get lost from here. Leave! Seetha, I hope it didn't happen for the worse. No one from Rano's family has shown up. Yes, I hope Daddy didn't make the situation worse. Sukhi, I have been sitting scared from a long time. Siti is still not back. Aunt has already scolded me twice. Ranjha looked after the goats for 12 years for Heer. Yes. Can't you wait here for 12 hours for her? Shut up and sit down. -Be patient, she will come. -Okay. "I wish to say something, but how do I say it? "I wish to ask something, but how do I ask?" "She doesn't say anything..." "She doesn't say anything to express her feelings" "My heart skips a beat when she smiles at me" "I am in heaven when she smiles at me" "My heart skips a beat when she smiles at me" "We talk through our eyes every day" "No words are exchanged" "We still haven't shared our feelings" "We talk through our eyes every day" "No words are exchanged" "We still haven't shared our feelings" "She steals my heart..." "She steals my heart when see looks at me affectionately" "My heart skips a beat when she smiles at me" "I am in heaven when she smiles at me" "My heart skips a beat when she smiles at me" "I sometimes feel like being bold, damn the consequences" "I sometimes feel like leaving it to God, He'll unite us" "I sometimes feel like being bold, damn the consequences" "I sometimes feel like leaving it to God, He'll unite us" "I consider her my God" "I consider her my God, she resides in my ever breath" Bye, buddy. Shindo and I are leaving. Sukhi will drop mother and Rano home. I am upset with you. You still didn't have a drink with me. I won't give you an opportunity to complain tomorrow. You will deceive me tomorrow as well. -Bye. -Bye. "My heart skips a beat when she smiles at me" "I am in heaven when she smiles at me" "My heart skips a beat when she smiles at me" Move aside, boy. I'll ride it. Granny, you will ride the motorcycle? Yes, girl. What do you think that I can only talk? This is a Bullet, granny, and not a cart. I told you right, so that's final. I'll ride it. Let's go. Don't forget. Meet me at 4:00am. I'll see. Tell me what did I write? You wrote that Rano isn't like any other girl. Rano, your beauty, your color, your gait, your nature.. You like it all, I know. Tell me what is it that you don't like? I don't like you staying away from me. I want my day to begin with you and end with you. I am madly in love with you. Do you even know what love is? Something you cannot take from someone on loan is called love. Now I shall move ahead only with your love. I don't wish to live without you. I think my new life shall begin with you. Now I only wait for you to claim me as yours. I have already claimed you as mine in my heart, sweetheart. -Let go of me. -Sadhu! Let go of me. I think I'll have to play this song today... "Seek revenge if you are what you claim to be." Shut up, discordant. -Okay, Daku Nath. -My name is Sadhu Nath. And my name is Surila and not Discordant. I am old enough to be your grandpa. Let go of me. You don't get respect just because you have a white beard. You have to earn it. -Someone save me! -Move side! Move side! Leave. -What are you doing, Chaddar? Move side! -I'll kill him. I haven't wrapped any sheet around me. I am wearing pajamas. I am taking his name, Chaddar. Come on! You got saved because of him today. Otherwise, I would have impaled this into you! Look at him! -Don't instigate me, I'll kill you. -Calm down. -What happened? -He woke me up early in the morning. He said go and call Bakiram in the evening. Why did he wake me up for something to be done in the evening? Look at his deeds, uncle. Then come and test me. Come on. I'll cut you into pieces. This won't work for long. You will see... in future you can get things from Delhi while sitting at home. Why don't you just use airplanes to get the goods here. Don't think that I am lame! I can teach a person a lesson with the legs I have. Chhotu! No need to cook anything special for them. Let them survive on what's already there. They think that they are someone great. Sadhu! Sadhu! Your deeds indeed deserve a beating. Do as you please, son. Chaddar, don't hit him with a brick. -Just don't hit him with a brick. -What are you doing? I am a very jovial person. I have worked in so many weddings in your family. You still don't know about my nature? You don't understand. -I was just joking with him. -Okay. -Let's get to work. -Go on. Tie me down. Why don't you tie me with you? A wedding is taking place here. There are a lot of things to do. I have to sometimes go here and sometimes go there. Should I inform you before going everywhere? What do you think of yourself? But I didn't say anything to you. Calm down. I know that. But everyone should know that the son-in-law is here. Go, someone like you cannot even eat two Ladoos. I can eat four layers of Barfi in a plate. -You want to bet? -Bet. -It's on, come on. -I'll see who makes bets. Special guests are coming at 5:00pm. Prepare for the Jagoo ceremony, behave yourself and get to work. Get them out, Fefra. My name is not Fefra. I am Kaleja. How many times do I have to tell you? It's a part of the body, right? Why are you getting angry? -How did you get the name Kaleja? -I'll tell you. I know everything. When his mother was pregnant with him, his parents used to fight a lot. They used to hit each other with slippers and all. His mother used to tell her husban.d, don't fight with me.. I feel uneasy, my Kaleja (liver) will pop out. -Then? -He came out. I'll break your jaw, I am warning you. You don't know, you were very small back then. Someone listen to me as well. I am the bride's father and not a servant. Make sure everyone has eaten by 2:00pm. They are just here to chat. Brother, the devotion with which you serve sister-in-law... if you had worshiped a stone then God would've appeared in it. It's just noon and you have already made six rounds to the kitchen. Why don't you just bring her and make her sit in the kitchen? Till when will you keep serving her? This way you will do your duty and her soul will be in peace. Let it be, sister. Don't cast an evil eye on my wife. Eat as much as you please today. After this you will be eating at your in-laws house. I say, why don't you too have something? I think you will make sure that I eat something. -Siti! -Coming! -Yes? -Take this. Sit and eat with her. You keep serving the girls, but you aren't bothered serving your father. It is 5:00pm. Make some arrangements so that I too... manage to dance at the Jagoo ceremony. -It's 5:00pm? -Yes. Girls, have you prepared the lamps for Jagoo ceremony? Today they will know what the maternal family can do. Yes, we will know... whether you pay back for the sweets you ate. Yes. Aunt, where's the pot to be used for Jagoo ceremony? Sukhi had brought it. I'll go and ask him. Okay. -Sukhi! -Take it all. Uncle, where is Sukhi? Sukhi? Sukhi! Over there, dear. Sukhi, where is the pot to be used for Jagoo ceremony? Jagoo's pot? There brother-in-law from Nabhe is sitting on it. -Get up! Seetha, give the pot to them inside. -Okay. Sukhi, today the maternal family will rock the dance floor. Go ahead. Sukhi isn't the one judging. -He is from the paternal side, right? -Right. Today the paternal side will make the maternal family roll like a top. Get ready to swirl. Sukhi! -Yes, father? Come here. -Coming. -I am coming. -Don't drink. Keep getting me drunk with your eyes, I'll get the pot ready. Seetha, look after our brother-in-law from Nabhe. Okay. What is it? You are having a serious conversation with brother. He's your brother, not mine. Sukhi! Sukhi! Yes, father? Here, look your uncle Jailu is drinking today at my request. I am very happy. This is called friendship, son. From the time I got married, I never behaved like a son-in-law with him. He's just like my brother. And you know why I came back from Germany. For us. Can I leave? I'll go and get some work done. Wait. Have a drink, you'll be able to work better. Jailu Singh, make a drink for him. I know he drinks stealthily. No father. I stopped drinking. What? Since when? -Who asked you to? -What? And he blushes. My enemies have been taking my happiness away. Rano's alliance... they were making demands. -I called it off. -You did the right thing. You shouldn't hand your daughter over to greedy people. Right. God does everything for a reason. I'll be right back. God does everything for a reason. Son-in-law, don't do what you did yesterday. Just go for it. Don't worry about it. Today you will see my style. Did you understand or shall I explain? I will be the one to rock the show today. You played a trick yesterday with us. Today you will see my style when I will wear a blue sheet... a orange butterfly print long shirt and green turban.. and come on the dance floor, it will make me double high. -Nothing can be better than that. -That's it. Don't be stubborn, Jailu. He is right. Drink slowly, don't drink all of it in one shot. Don't say anything, you troublemaker. Jailu, stop this. Stop this. Here. -This fine? -Yes. What are you girls calculating? Lift it and give it to the aunt. Hurry up, we have to get up early in the morning... and make preparations as well. Here you go. "Brighten up your life, Jagoo is here" "This is great, Jagoo is here" "This is great, Jagoo is here" "Keep quiet, I have just put my baby girl to sleep" "I sung a lullaby to her. She will wake up. She will cry" Stop it! Stop it! Jagoo is here. Jagoo is here. What should we stop? No, I mean Chaddar made me climb up. Now I cannot come down. I too wish to dance. Jagoo is here. Come on. "This is great, Jagoo is here" There, they have started. As if you cannot celebrate Jagoo without singing. It's okay, young kids like it. You don't need to look at Jagoo. What did you say? It's nothing. He didn't say anything. Keep drinking. I'll be right back. "Don't you stare at me, oh boy" "I am known to have fire in my eyes" "Don't you stare at me, oh boy" "I am known to have fire in my eyes" "I'll give you sleepless nights" "I'll give you sleepless nights" "I'll get ingrained in your heart" "My beauty is as famous with the boys..." "As the sheikh of Dubai is in the world" "My beauty is as famous with the boys..." "As the sheikh of Dubai is in the world" "My beauty is as famous with the boys..." "As the sheikh of Dubai is in the world" "I'll cross the biggest hurdle" "Don't test my courage, oh beautiful" "I'll cross the biggest hurdle" "Don't test my courage, oh beautiful" "I agree that you are mesmerizingly beautiful" "I agree that you are mesmerizingly beautiful" "Everyone is eager to steal it" "I'll come in handy to protect your beauty" "I am a quick-tempered Jatt" "-I'll come in handy to protect your beauty -Wonderful" "I am a quick-tempered Jatt" "I'll come in handy to protect your beauty" "I am a quick-tempered Jatt" "Wonderful" "I don't know how to settle for less" "Tell me, do you want my life?" "Do you want my life?" "I don't know how to settle for less" "Tell me, do you want my life?" "Do you want my life?" "You have broken many hearts" "You have broken many hearts" "-Saying such sweet words - Wonderful" "I'll come in handy to protect your beauty" "My beauty is as famous with the boys..." "-I'll come in handy to protect your beauty -Wonderful" "I am a quick-tempered Jatt." "As the sheikh of Dubai is in the world." "I'll come in handy to protect your beauty." "I am a quick-tempered Jatt." "Oh my!" "Wonderful." Mind your language, Jailu! Otherwise, I'll throw you down. Those who want to throw me down will die. Who are you? You keep saying, drink less. Don't drink more. You idiot, I had told you for your own good. My own good? Are you King Harish Chandra? The Europeans threw you out of Germany. You came here with nothing. There you used to wash utensils. And here you behave like a big man. What's wrong with that? I am a big man. The boy's family asked for a car. I am not as cheapskate as you... that I'd break the alliance of my girl for that reason. -What did you say? -Yes. -No! No! -You are our guest! -I'll see you! -What will you see? -I'll get you! -Calm down. -Seetha! What is happening? -Let me go! -Let me go! I'll show him. -It's okay. Calm down. -Let it go. -Let me go! I'll go and break his head. Let me go! You were thrown out of Germany. You taunt me! I didn't get the girl married and all. I got insulted. No one insulted you. Jailu, what are you doing? You have done it again? You ruined everything. You are so old yet you cannot keep a drink down. Why don't you teach me how to drink in your school? This is how you drink less. This is how you drink more. You have started lecturing me as if I've been drinking imported liquor. He cannot digest it. That's why he doesn't drink. Let me go! Why are you still standing here? Are you shackled here? Come home with me. -We will go. -We'll never come back! Go away! We don't want rich folks like you either. -Shindo, take this king home. -You shut up. Stop it. -Come on. -I don't beg to anyone. -Come with me, buddy. Come on. -Bring the girl along. Take her away. We aren't making your Rano work here. Don't go anywhere, dear. Stay here. Don't worry about him. He will get sober tomorrow and forget everything. Someone will drop you home later. It's considered an ill omen till something... like this doesn't happen at a wedding. It's nothing. Come on, let's go. Come on, everyone. Let's go, everyone. Nothing happened. Oh God. Come on. Run away, Jailu. Run away. I'll have tackled many like you. I am your brother-in-law. I'll not spare you. We'll teach him a lesson, damn the consequences. This old men have caused a new problem. -We'll get them! Sukhi, we'll.. -What will you get? We'll get them! Yes, that's what I am saying! We'll get them! "If uncles don't fight and sulk for importance..." "If the new son-in-law doesn't get sloshed..." "You won't get such a lot collection of drunkard anywhere else..." "It's not a wedding, till you don't gather cots and mattresses" Why are you crying and ruining your mood? Uncle is always like this. That's why we don't let him drink. Stop crying now. What if he doesn't let you come here tomorrow? He cannot stop me from coming here tomorrow. And then Sukhi is smart. Tomorrow he will convince uncle to attend as well. This is a big mess. Bholi will get married but what will happen to us? I am not worried about that. The person who can break my alliance, can do anything for me. I didn't. Why would I break your alliance? Don't try to act smart. Hit the brakes, we have reached home. Or do you wish to tour the whole village? I wish to tour the whole world with you. What color dress are you wearing tomorrow for the wedding? Why should I tell you? Wear a blue color turban tomorrow. And yes, wear a coat. Don't wear a waistcoat with a tie and get ridiculed. Go now. You have to get up early tomorrow. Uncle Jailu will allow you to come tomorrow? I know how I have to come. Okay. Then good night. And I love you. Shameless fellow. You won't leave so easily. Uncle.. Please come outside. Look, there's someone unknown at the door. As if I am scared of uncle. Uncle! No, I've come to the wrong address. Stupid. Finally, here lies Sindal from Nabhe on the historic cot. Stand up. How many times have I told you not to sit on this cot? Friendship also has some limits. Then you can wear the waistcoat tomorrow. Hey, you start threatening me at every point. Listen, I have arranged for blue turban from uncle. But she wants me to wear a coat. Arrange for a coat. This is what I wanted to tell you. Sindal from Nabhe has a coat. Then step on his tail. He says Sukhi... Sukhi, brother-in-law from Nabhe will be the best tomorrow. He'll put all the guests to shame when he'll wear a coat tomorrow. And you will wear this waistcoat. Don't touch the waistcoat. I spent the whole day and hunted down this waistcoat from Cohra market. A coat is nothing great. Every second person wears a coat during a wedding nowadays. Even the waiters wear coats. The one who wears a waistcoat is the one who exhibits style. The one who wears a waistcoat. Sukhi... Give me the waistcoat. I won't give it, brother-in-law. Sukhi, give me the waistcoat. I won't give it, brother-in-law. Sukhi... I said give me the waistcoat. Do you understand or shall I explain? Okay so you mean you will wear Sukhi's waistcoat... Then what will he wear, your coat? He'll have to wear it. I won't give it, brother-in-law. Give it, Sukhi. Otherwise, brother-in-law will shout and gather the whole village. -Oh yes, I should shout. -No, brother-in-law. -Take this waistcoat. Take it. -Give it. Coat. Brother-in-law, where is the coat? Brother-in-law, where is the coat? In the cupboard. The coat is in the cupboard. Dongra, you? Jeona, here are two turbans. If you make Kishan and Dogar brothers again tomorrow... then Rano will be yours. Well done, Dongra. That's a great scheme. Chaddar, what if his Chocolate Barfi isn't tasty? Then you will see him sitting on ice. Chaddar, the way Sadhu is praying, I feel... that he will sit on the ice. Whatever you may say, this old man is quite entertaining. -He has a few odd habits. -True. But there's one thing, if Sadhu wins the Barfi match.. then his name will echo in our ears like Manak's songs. "Barfi" Now you want me to wear the turban sent by Jailu at the wedding? This means you didn't come from Germany for us. Are you trying to get me closer to Jailu.. or are you fearing that you'll get distanced from someone? Both. I said I don't want to go. You don't understand it. You have a right to be angry. How is it right? It is not right. It is not right. It is your wish, Jailu. But think about it. Hello, uncle Jailu. Hello. What are you thinking about? What do you want from me? No, I don't want anything. I have come to give you something. Uncle has sent an apology. Sukhi's father. Look, both of you made a mistake. He stopped you from drinking and you were rude. Then you two had an argument. Uncle has sent this turban. Keep it. He scored brownie points by apologizing. He said that if Jailu wears this turban and comes... then I'll attend the wedding otherwise I'll go back immediately. Who is in the bathroom? I have been standing here since one hour. Who wants to get into trouble? Your brother-in-law is having a bath. I'll take some time. I have a huge body. Do you understand or shall I explain? I'll come out and tell you. Go to hell! Sister-in-law, where have you kept Bholi's jewellery? Oh, yes. Here are the keys. Get them out from the trunk. I'll go and give tea to the priest. Why hasn't Rano come? Seethe, uncle Jailu hasn't come as yet. He is here. Come on, greet each other. They aren't even looking at each other. Getting them to talk seems impossible. We'll have to think of a scheme. I'll talk to Daddy. Siti, what you did with me was not right. Damn you, I'll teach you a lesson. You come here applying kohl in your big eyes. Applying kohl in your big eyes. I'll teach you a lesson today. Damn you, you shouldn't ruin other people's marriage. Did anyone see this? -Have you seen Siti anywhere? -Get lost. Coat doesn't look good. What happened, Sukhi? I have spoken to Daddy. He had made a plan. He has made a plane? Daddy also started making plane? -Here son, have some sweets. -Yes. Well done. You have made very tasty Barfi. Father, give him 100 rupees. -Sure, son. -Thank you god. -Thank you very much. -Take it. Give me this. Let it be, father. You might lose it. -He did it. -Come here. Chaddar, your instigation worked. Instigation ruins everything. I had told father that. He said I will apologize but... If and buts only ruin things. Jailu says let's shake hands once. No, no, no. I won't shake hands with that man who thinks he is great. I'll stand next to him if you say. There is no problem in standing next to him. There should be no problem. It's not like you both fired canons. If you two had an India Pakistan kind of a war... then too I would have made you two compromise. Ask why? Friendship shouldn't end. Let's go. The wedding vows are about to begin. So Tota, did you get Siti? Get lost. Everyone's daughters and sisters are like our own. Really? You learnt that after getting your wings clipped? Get lost. I don't want to eat fritters. I didn't offer them to you. No, I mean don't I want to eat fritters? You scared me. Both of them sat together during the wedding vows. God have mercy and may they unite in such a way... that they never fall apart again. Leave. I'll go and get the report. -Go ahead. -I will. It was a pleasure talking to you. You should. I wouldn't give it to the biggest enemy if I am forced. Take it if you want but take it out of love. I'll be ready to lay down at the feet for love. But for someone who has fake pride... I hurt them so bad that they end up sighing. I break friendship with someone who always says hurtful things. And I cannot be friends with someone who talks nonsense. These men who are breaking plates... can be controlled only by those who wash plates. Where is Daddy? Don't ruin Rano and Sukhi's life because of the fight between the elders. Both of you should stick together. Ladies can make the governments fall. You won't find a daughter-in-law as good as Rano. You won't find a son-in-law as good as Sukhi. Right? Tell me about it! What could be better than the fact that they both like each other? But who will talk to their fathers? Now only the one who talks nonstop can talk to them. -Who can talk better than him? -Yes. I had gone to your wives to discuss your fight. But the scolded me. They said let them fight. But we have fixed another match at this wedding. Who's match? Sukhi and Rano. Don't make me break your bones. What is the fault of my bones? It was my tongue which said these things. I'll pull your tongue out. Why my tongue? Your wives said so. I didn't say it. And even God cannot go against women. How can you against them? If you want to try then go ahead. How will it hurt me? In Ludhiana too a man tried to go against his wife. She committed suicide and left a suicide note saying.. This sinner is responsible for my death. The decision is in your hands. I am just middleman, I have a lot to do. Do as you please. Gareya. When friendship becomes weak even the mute start talking. I had called you so that I could drink with you and also hint you. But you drank alcohol and started insulting me. You forgot what you did? When you had come here to get married. You got drunk and even lost all money while playing cards with the guests. I got them back for you. You forgot about the Lala's goons that surrounded you in the market? I had saved you back then, Jailu. Who got insulted after losing the headman elections? You had, Gareya. You had! If you had to say such things... then why did you send this turban I am wearing? I didn't send it. You sent the one I am wearing. I won't give you a piece of rag and you say I gave you a turban? -This is a limit, what does he think of himself. -Wait a minute. You didn't send me a turban and I didn't send a turban to you. -Yes. -Then who sent these turbans? I had sent them. When two heads take the wrong path... then you need turbans to bring them on the right tracks. I had sent the turbans to mend your relationship. To fix our relationship or yours? You're trying to benefit yourself, when two cats are fighting right? Okay, that's why your turban color matches Rano's dress. No, this is just a coincidence. We value our elder's honor and pride more than our desires. Yes, whether or not we two get together... but you two shouldn't get separated. What Rano means to say is that our family should be one. Gareya, if you had been even a little smart as your son... then things would have been different today. And would it harm you if you had borrowed some sense from your niece? Look, it is an auspicious day, talk about fixing our wedding. Just don't keep exchanging insults. Hey, when did you become so smart? Ever since you came back from Germany. And you know why you came back from Germany. Yes, you had come back to fix our marriage. I don't accept this alliance. I don't like the girl. Gareya, don't say anything against my niece. Now this marriage will take place at any cost. Okay, as you say. -What? -I agree with you. Stop making those noises and give a hug to him. Decide what do you want to demand and all. I demand a cot and mattress. And what about the one who had said yes for the cot and mattress? What will I do with the cot and mattress without her? Here, eat the Chocolate Barfi. Sadhu Nath did it! Bring it here. Show it to me. -Here you go. -Sukhi, try the Chocolate Barfi. Oh! Book Nath and give him an advance... for Sukhi and Rano, he shouldn't get a chance to refuse later. If he refuses, we will drag him here. He doesn't know what we are made up of. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'll gather the cots and mattresses at Sukhi's wedding. It is not a big thing to gather cots and mattresses. It is a very big thing. The cots and mattresses got the north and the south. Isn't that a big deal? Cots and mattresses remind me... back then I was with Jeona Morh. When I was a kid? No son, you didn't exist back then. Once a few boys got together... and went to gather cots and mattresses for a wedding. We went on walking. We went on walking. Father, you must have reached by now. No. We went on walking. We reached now. When we reached there, and I touched a cot... their daughter said keep the cot down. I told him that I am a confectioner. Once I keep the wok on fire, then I don't stop cooking. She said that my father owns a grocery store. We don't give anything for free to anyone. I said then let's strike a deal by exchanging a few sweet words. She was stubborn. She looked at me suspiciously. Then what happened? Then what would happen? After a year or so Chhotu happened. Then all the neighbors got together and said... Sadhu, what have you done? He said this is what happens when you hurry. Sadhu, you have always been quirky. You don't know these things. -You were... -A kid back then.
