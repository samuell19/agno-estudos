Hello? Pippi, do you know, where Shabbo is? Why? - What is it to you? Tell me if you know, where Shabbo is. I know, but I won't tell you. Unless you tell me why. She gave me a face-pack recipe. I applied it and saw myself in the mirror and.. Got scared? You look scary, even without a face pack! Witch. Have you ever seen yourself? You Baked Potato. You're a foe, not a friend. Okay, bye. Hey, but you didn't tell me where Shabbo is. How do I know? Then why did you say, you knew? To extract some gossip from you! Witch! Slut! What do I do now? Who could it be? Hold on. I'm not dead yet! The courtesan! At your service. So, finally you are here. I've been calling the whole world for you. What's wrong? Your face! What's wrong with, my face? Turn away, please. Why? Just do it. Hey, Mandy! Go inside and don't you dare look this way! Who are you sending in? Who is it? A kid.. Might get scared looking at you! Insulting me, in my own house? What is it exactly? Face pack! Might have got it in sale, or second hand. Witch! It was your recipe. You gave it to me over the phone the other day. Impossible. My recipe? Can't be. What did you mix? Sandalwood powder mixed, in fuller's earth turmeric, cream.. And indigo in the end. Oh no! Now what? You put 'neel' (indigo) instead of 'neem' (herb). Is that so? I told you to use neem herb paste and you put indigo! Oh, God! Is that what you said? Perhaps I heard wrong! What do I do now, Shabbo? Before you're unable to face the world go and wash your face! Mad cow! Mandy. - Yeah? Take my bags inside. Okay. No! Leave this alone. Mandy? - Yeah? Get me some water. The kitchen is over there. And be careful. Don't break anything. Or else Bibbo will curse you for seven lives! Bitching about me? I never bitch about anyone! Just telling Mandy, what a darling you are at heart! Really? Who is this tender tendril? Mandy.. My personal boy! Oh! Personal boy? Boy? Looks more like a girl! Are you a 'kothi'? 'Kothi'? What's that? What's that? Shabbo, you didn't teach him anything? Not even the meaning of 'Kothi'? Darling, 'kothi' means.. Us! Us? Yeah.. Like me, Shabbo, you.. 'Kothi'! Everyone calls us jaggery, sweet rice puffed bread. Shabbo, how do you say it, in English? Queens. Drag queens, darling. Yes! Maharani! Understood, gay? Gay? Yes, I am gay! Oh! An English queen! Look, you want to be with us stop twittering in English.. Shake your booty instead! Like this.. Give it back! - No. What is it? - Give it back. No. - Bibbo, please give it back. Why so riled up? - Please give it. Something is wrong! Oh, a new Romeo! Even writes love letters! Does it bother you? - Why wouldn't it? I'm your mom, after all. Am I not? Mom? Is she your mother? Adopted mother, stupid! I've taken her up as my mom. So won't you tell your mom whose love letter it is? It's no letter! It's my earnings. From today's show. Shaking your booty for a bunch of rogues! You call that a show? Say what you want! People love my dancing. I'm in great demand. Even got signed for a film. Isn't that right, Mandy? Yes. - Yes? Must be in a C-grade film as an extra dancing in the last row! Why act so snobby? You also design dresses for C-grade actors. So flashy, so tacky! You're jealous. Me? Jealous? For what? Because I make young studs strip ten times a day. Studs? Don't I know it! Outside majestic, inside matchstick! You smirk now! In front of them, you go wriggling your tail pleading for an introduction! Have you forgotten Imran? You just got burned! Mandy, answer the door! Bibbo? Because I'm your mom, I'm helping you. Who is it? Who is it? Oh! I'll just be back. Tonight is Ritesh's party, then dinner, and later.. Shabbo, meet my Samir! Hello. - Hello. Bibbo, just a sec! Who is he? My new driver. But you never told me! He just joined yesterday. As it is, I change my driver every month. Who cares to remember? I forgot. How can you forget telling about such a dish? Such a dish? Don't act so innocent. Quite a man! He's all right! Stop ogling! He's no superstar. He's merely my driver. But you don't even own a car! Silly girl, he has one. Oh, got it! - What? He wants roles in films. That's why, he.. Had him? Shut up, slut! I'm not like you! Just helping him. Oh, social service. But, why call him to your house right now? I'm going to a party and he'll drive me there. Any problems? Samir? - Yeah? I'll get ready. Okay. Whose party is it, Bibbo? Ritesh's. Ritesh? That rich model from Pali Hill who sucks up to directors, for roles. Don't you know him? I do.. But.. But what? Oh, you are not invited? It's all right. You can come as my guest. Ritesh never refuses entry to my guests. I have other plans. I'm doing, a special show tonight. What? You do shows? - Yes. Shows! Dancing at some sleazy party! This isn't just any party. The famous director Taran is getting married tomorrow. So? His friends are throwing a party tonight. You know? Bachelor's party? Yeah, Yeah. Of course, I know. Must be really boring! No! I've been to one party like that. It was fun. Fun? Yeah, we all got drunk. I flirted with a dancer there. You too? Yeah! Of course! Got it, Bibbo. Now you know what they mean. Bedding before wedding! What do you say, Samir? Yeah? Yeah! Such a shy, sweetie. In fact, both of you can come with me as my guests! Thank you very much. Not my cup of tea! Besides I've already promised Ritesh. I'm going to be late. Suit yourself. Samir will come with me. Right, Samir? I have to go with her. Scared of Bibbo? Ritesh's party will be boring. Only oldie-goldies. At my party, everyone will be young like us! Think it over. Meanwhile, I'll fix drinks. Anyone interested? Bibbo? No! Samir? - Yeah? Then come with me and pick your drink. Mandy, you stay here to help Bibbo. What will you have? - Anything, but beer. I don't drink beer - Why? High fat content! And I am an actor. I might put on weight. But you don't have to worry, at all. Your body is really appealing. These bulging biceps.. Your face. So handsome! Your lips. Oops.. You must give up smoking. Besides quitting smoking, I'm ready to do anything. Anything? You sure? "I've told you many times.." "Don't wear, black attire." "Nor white attire." "Or even, something dirty." "You'll stay happy, forever." Dear Mandy. Do you know how to mix drinks? Of course. I make great cocktails! Red Eye, Martini, Bloody Mary, Screwdriver. Driver! Leave that alone! Bring me a rum and cola. Just rum and cola? Yeah. Stir it well and put lots of ice and hurry. If you dare come back without my drink I will slaughter you! Now watch the fun! You are so naughty. What are you doing here, Mandy? Aunt Bibbo wants a drink. She didn't want one, earlier. Oh. Samir, excuse me. Hello! Sent Mandy to spy on me? Why aren't you saying anything? Answer me. You didn't want a drink, at first. Now I do. What's wrong with your voice? Parched. That's why I need a drink. Don't I know you? Scheming hag! I speak two words with him and your throat goes parched. So talk to him as much you want. And send Mandy up here. But your drink? You fix it. "Today, intoxicated with love, my heart.." "My heart is up to.." - Your smile is really good. You should try films. I'll help you. Mandy, Bibbo is calling you. But her drink? I will get it. Leave. What's the matter? - Nothing much. She wanted some makeup tips! Oh, your drink is over. Let me fix another. Mandy? Pass me the base. May I? All right. So which directors has Bibbo introduced you to? None worth mentioning. I knew it. Why don't you come with me? - Where? To Taran's party. It would be great fun! We will sing and dance.. Mandy! Can't you watch out? You spilled the powder! Leave it alone. He's just a kid.. It was my imported powder. It's okay. I have one in the cupboard. Imported.. From Paris. Selfish slut! Hiding it from me? I was going to gift it to you. Really? - Yes. Thank you. Still standing here? Clean up this mess! Please have a drink. Such patchy makeup! Mandy is useless. It didn't even blend. Show me. Your eyes are red! It's nothing. Something must've gotten in them. I'll put in eye drops. Samir! Stub out you cigarette. Go and freshen up! We are running late for the party. Okay. How do I look, Shabbo? You will shake up everyone there. Everyone or everyone's? Bibbo, come with me to my show, please. I'll be a misfit there. Not a misfit, you will be Miss Hit. Remember Amol's party? How we both danced together? "The peacock dances in the backyard, midnight." "The peacock dances in the backyard, midnight." "My bangles make noise." "Look, my bangles make noises." "My bangles make noise, in my hand." "The peacock dances in the backyard, midnight." What happened? Mandy, get up. Samir, go and get dressed. Why are you so happy? I would've been happier if instead of Mandy it were me, under him! Shameless slut! What's there to be shy about? Wouldn't you like it too? You and your personal boy, shameless witches! Why the ruckus? It's as if the sky has fallen! Don't forget, he is my driver! As if he doesn't know about you, me.. The truth! That you are to sleep with him! Perhaps you have already. Shut up. I haven't stooped so low! Not fallen! Is that why you are jealous? You and your dirty one-track mind! Talk about yourself, honey. A pious prostitute! I am not like you, slut. You sleep with every Tom, Dick and Harry! You only roll around with stars! Don't make me spill your secrets, witch. Be it dancers or extras, you've tried them all. At this age, you can't catch anyone, so your grapes are sour! Grapes or raisins, you still have your fill. No wonder.. - No wonder what? You are infected! Excuse me? You were amazing! Mind blowing! Thank you. And me? - You're wonderful too. We caused quite a riot. That green-shirt guy just clung on to me. Just one? So many people were mad about me! Because we were in drag, but they were all straight! Straight, my foot! All they want is a hole. No matter what, no one leaves a bubble gum! Right. But today you danced really well. I learned from you, mom. You call me mom and keep secrets from me! I wanted to but didn't have the courage. But Shabbo.. No.. Not a word more. Today let's just celebrate. And cheers! One thing is bothering me. Now what? Samir kissed you first! A kiss won't make him mine. He is yours. But seems like he has the hots for you! Why are you giggling? Spill it or I'll clap on your face! He has asked me out on a date. Who? Him! Oh, him! Can I have a say in this? No! The queens always have the final say.
