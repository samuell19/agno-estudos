Subtitles adapted from the translations of Curtis Hidden Page and Charles Matthews Come, come, Flipotte, and let me get away. You hurry so, I hardly can attend you. Then don't, dear daughter-in law. Stay where you are. I can dispense with your polite attentions. We're only paying what is due you, mother. Why must you go away in such a hurry? Because I can't endure your carryings-on, And no one takes the slightest pains to please me. Yes, I leave your house, I tell you, quite disgusted; You do the opposite of my instructions; You've no respect for anything; each one... ...must have his say; it's perfect pandemonium. If... You're a servant wench, my girl, and much too full of gab... and too impertinent... and free with your advice on all occasions. But... You're a fool, my boy—f, o, o, l Just spells your name. Let grandma tell you that I've said a hundred times to my poor son, your father, that you'd never come to good... ...or give him anything but plague and torment. - I think... - O dear, his sister! You're all demureness, Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth. Still waters, though, they say … you know the proverb; And I don't like your doings on the sly. But, mother… Daughter, by your leave... ...your conduct in everything is altogether wrong; You ought to set a good example for them... Their dear departed mother did much better. You are extravagant... and it offends me, to see you always decked out like a princess. A woman who would please her husband's eyes alone... ...wants no such wealth of fineries. But, madam, after all… Sir, as for you... I esteem you highly, love and respect you. But, all the same, if I were in my son's, her husband's, place... ...I'd urgently entreat you not to come within our doors. You forever preach a way of living... ...that decent people cannot tolerate. I'm rather frank with you, but that's my way... I don't mince matters, when I mean a thing. Mr Tartuffe, your friend, is mighty lucky… He is a holy man... ...and must be heeded. I can't endure, with any show of patience... ...to hear a scatterbrain like you attack him. What! Shall I let a bigot criticaster... ...come and usurp a tyrant's power here? And shall we never dare amuse ourselves... ...till this fine gentleman deigns to consent? If we must hark to him, and heed his maxims... ...there's not a thing we do but what's a crime. He censures everything, this zealous carper. And all he censures is well censured, too. He wants to guide you on the way to heaven... My son should train you all to love him well. No, madam, look you, nothing... ...not my father nor anything, can make me tolerate him. I should belie my feelings not to say so. His actions rouse my wrath at every turn... And I foresee that there must come of it... ...an open rupture with this sneaking scoundrel. Certainly. Besides, 'tis downright scandalous to see... ...this unknown upstart master of the house... This vagabond, who hadn't, when he came, shoes to his feet... ..or clothing worth six farthings, and who so far forgets his place, as now... ...to censure everything, and rule the roost! Eh! Mercy sakes alive! Things would go better if all were governed by his pious orders. He passes for a saint in your opinion. In fact, he's nothing but a hypocrite. Just listen to her tongue! I wouldn't trust him, nor yet his Laurent, without bonds and surety. I don't know what the servant's character may be... ...but I can guarantee the master is a holy man. You hate him and reject him... because he tells home truths to all of you. 'Tis sin alone that moves his heart to anger... ...and heaven's interest is his only motive. Of course. But why, especially of late... ...can he let nobody come near the house? Is heaven so offended at a civil call ...that he should make so great a fuss about it? I'll tell you, if you like, just what I think... Upon my word, he's jealous of our mistress. You hold your tongue, and think what you are saying. He's not alone in censuring these visits. The turmoil that attends your sort of people... Their carriages forever at the door... And all their noisy footmen, flocked together, ...annoy the neighbourhood, and raise a scandal. I'd gladly think there's nothing really wrong... But it makes talk... ...and that's not as it should be. Hey! Madam, can you hope to keep folk's tongues from wagging? It would be a grievous thing... ...if, for the fear of idle talk about us, we had to sacrifice our friends. Even if we brought ourselves to do it... ...think you everyone would then be silenced? Against backbiting there is no defence. To silly tattle let's pay no heed at all... and let us try to live in innocence... and leave the gossips free to vent their gall. Our neighbour Daphne, and her little husband, I feel, ...must be the ones who slander us. Those whose own conduct's most ridiculous... ...are always quickest to speak ill of others. They never fail to seize at once upon... ...the slightest hint of any love affair... ...and spread the news of it with glee... ...and give it the character they'd have the world believe. By others' actions, painted in their colours... ...they think they'll justify their own... ...and In the false hope of some resemblance... ...either to make their own intrigues seem innocent... ...or else to make others share the blame... ...with which they are loaded by everybody. These arguments are nothing to the purpose. Orante, we all know, lives a perfect life... Her thoughts are all of heaven... and I have heard that she condemns the company you keep. An admirable example... She's a virtuous lady. She lives the model of austerity... But age has brought this piety upon her... And she's a prude. Now she can't help herself. As long as she could capture men's attentions... ...she made the most of her advantages. But, now she sees her beauty vanishing. She wants to renounce the world, that's deserting her... and in the specious veil of haughty virtue... ...she'd hide the frailty of her worn-out charms. That is the way with all your old coquettes... They find it hard to see their lovers leave them... And thus abandoned... ...their forlorn estate can find no occupation but a prude's. These pious dames, in their austerity... ...must carp at everything, and pardon nothing. They loudly blame others' way of living.. ...not for religion's sake, but out of envy... Because they can't endure to see another enjoy the pleasures... ...that age has weaned them from. There! That's the kind of rigmarole to please you. Daughter-in-law, we're forced to silence in your house, ...because Madam holds the floor all day. But none the less, I mean to have my say, too. I tell you my son did nothing wiser in all his life... ...than take this godly man into his household. Heaven sent him here, in your great need... ...to make you all repent. For your salvation, you must hearken to him... He censures nothing but what deserves his censure. These visits, these gatherings, and these balls... ...are all inventions of the evil spirit. At them you never hear a word of godliness... Just idle cackle, nonsense, flimflam. Our neighbour often comes in for a share. The talk flies fast, and scandal fills the air... It makes a sober person's head go round... ...in the confusion of these assemblies... The sound of so much gab, with not a word to say. And as a learned man remarked one day... ...'tis a veritable Tower of Babylon, ...where all, beyond all limit, babble on. And just to tell you how this point came to him... So! Now the gentleman must snicker, must he? Go find fools like yourself to make you laugh, and don't… Daughter, good-bye. Not one word more from me. As for this house, I leave the half unsaid... But I shan't soon set foot in it again. Come, you! What makes you dream and stand agape? Hussy! I'll warm your ears in proper shape! Get going! Trollop! Get going! I won't escort her down, for fear she might fall foul of me again, The good old lady... Bless us! What a pity. She shouldn't hear the way you speak of her! She'd tell you you're too good by half... ...and that she's not so old, as to have "old" in her name. How she got angry with us, all for nothing! And how she seems possessed with her Tartuffe! Her case is nothing, though, beside her son's! To see him, you would say he's ten times worse! His conduct in our late unpleasantness... ...had won him much esteem, and proved his courage. But now he's like a man possessed... ...since he's been so taken with this Tartuffe. He calls him his brother... ...and loves him a hundred times more than mother, son, daughter, and wife. He is confidant to all his secrets... ...and the wise guide to all his actions He fondles and embraces him... A mistress, could not, I think, be loved more tenderly. At table he must have the seat of honour... While with delight our master sees him eat as much as six men could... ...we must give up the choicest tidbits to him. If he belches, Master exclaims "God bless you!" Oh, he dotes upon him! He's his universe, his hero. He's lost in constant admiration, quotes him on all occasions... ...takes his trifling acts for wonders... ...and every word he says, for oracles. The fellow knows his dupe, and makes the most of it... ...and fools him with a hundred masks of virtue... Gets money from him all the time by canting... ...and takes upon himself to carp at us. Even his silly coxcomb of a lackey... ...makes it his business to instruct us too. He comes with rolling eyes, to preach at us... ...and throws away our ribbons, rouge, and patches. The wretch, the other day, tore up a kerchief... ...that he had found, pressed in The Flower of Saints... ...calling it a horrid crime for us to mingle... ...the devil's finery with holy things. You're very lucky to have missed the speech she gave us at the door. I see my husband's home again. He hasn't seen me yet, so I'll go up and wait till he comes in. And I, to save time, will await him here... I'll merely say good-morning, and be gone. I wish you'd say a word to him about my sister's marriage... I suspect Tartuffe opposes it... ..and puts my father up to all these wretched shifts. You know, besides, the interest that I have myself. If love unites my sister and Valere... ...the sister of this friend is my love too. - And if he were to... - He's coming. Ah! Good morning, brother. I was just going, but am glad to greet your return. The country at present is not very pleasant. Dorine... Just wait a bit, please, brother-in-law. Let me allay my first anxiety by asking news about the family. Has everything gone well these last two days? What's happening? How is everyone? Madam had fever, and a splitting headache... ...the day before yesterday, all day and evening. And Tartuffe? "Tartuffe" ? He's mighty well... stout, fat, fair, rosy-lipped. Poor man! At evening she had nausea... ...and couldn't touch a single thing for supper... ...her headache still was so very cruel. And Tartuffe? He supped alone, in front of her... ...and devoutly ate up two fat partridges... ...with half a leg of minced mutton. Poor man! The whole night passed without her having a wink of sleep... ...the fever racked her so, and we had to sit with her till daylight. And Tartuffe? Gently inclined to slumber... ...he went to his room on leaving the table... ...got himself straight into a good warm bed... ...and slept quite undisturbed until next morning. Poor man! At last, she let us all persuade her... ...and got up courage to be bled... and was relieved at once. And Tartuffe? He plucked up courage as required... ...and bravely entrenched his soul against all evils. To replace the blood that Madame had lost... ...he drank at breakfast, four huge draughts of wine. Poor man! So now they both are doing well. I'll go straightway and inform my mistress... ...how pleased you are at her recovery. Brother, she ridicules you to your face. Though I don't want to anger you... ...I must be candid and say that she's quite right. Was such infatuation ever heard of before? And can a man to-day have charms... ...to make you forget all else for him... ...give him a home, relieve his poverty, and then… Stop there, brother-in-law. You don't know the man of whom you speak. Since you will have it so, I do not know him. But after all, to tell what sort of man he is… Dear brother... ...you'd be charmed to know him. Your raptures over him would have no end. He is a man… who... Ah... a man! In fact …a man. Whoever does his will, knows perfect peace... ...and counts the whole world else, as so much dung. Yes... His converse has transformed me quite... He teaches me to have no love for anything on earth... He weans my heart from every friendship. And I could watch die... ...brother, children, mother and wife... ...and never once care one whit. Such humane sentiments, I must say, brother! Ah! If you'd seen him, as I saw him first... ...you would have loved him just as much as I. He came to church each day, with contrite mien... Kneeled, on both knees, right opposite my pew. He drew the eyes of all the congregation... ...to see the fervour of his prayers to heaven. With deep-drawn sighs and great ejaculations... ...he humbly kissed the earth at every moment. And as I left the church, he ran before me... ...to give me holy water at the door. By questioning his servant, who is like him... ...I learned his poverty, and who he was. I gave him gifts... ...but in his modesty... ...he always wanted to return a part. "It is too much," he'd say, "too much by half." " I am not worthy of your pity." When I refused to take it back... ...before my eyes, he'd go and give it to the poor. At length heaven bade me take him to my home... ...and since that day, all seems to prosper here. I see he censures everything... ..and for my sake takes great interest in my wife. He lets me know who ogles her... ...and seems six times as jealous as I am myself. You'd not believe how far his zeal can go. He calls himself a sinner just for trifles. The merest nothing is enough to shock him. So much so, that the other day I heard him... ...accuse himself for having, while at prayer... ...in too much anger, caught and killed a flea. Zounds, brother, you are mad, I think! Or else you're making sport of me, with such a speech. What are you driving at... ...with all this nonsense? My brother... That reeks of libertine philosophy. I suspect your soul is somewhat tainted by it. As I've preached to you a score of times... ...you'll draw down judgment on your head. That is the usual strain of all your kind... They must have every one as blind as they. You're called libertine if you have good eyes... And if you don't adore their vain grimaces... ...you've neither faith, nor care for sacred things. No, no... such talk cannot frighten me. I know what I say, and heaven sees my heart. We're not the dupes of all your canting mummers. There are false heroes... and false devotees. And as true heroes never are the ones who boast about their deeds of honour... Just so, the true devotees, whom we should follow... ...are not the ones who make so much vain show. What? Will you find no difference between hypocrisy and devoutness? Will you treat them both alike... ..and pay equal honour to both mask and face? Set artifice beside sincerity... Confuse the semblance with reality... Esteem a phantom like a living person... ...and counterfeit as good as honest coin? Men, for the most part, are strange creatures... You never find them keep the golden mean... The limits of good sense, too narrow for them... ...must always be passed by, in each direction. They often spoil the noblest things... ...because they go too far, and push them to extremes. I merely say this as an aside, brother-in-law. You are no doubt a fount of wisdom. All the knowledge of the world resides with you. You are the only sage, the sole enlightened... An oracle, a Cato, in this our age. All men, compared to you, are downright fools. I am not a fount of wisdom, brother... ...and all knowledge does not reside with me. But this I know, though it be all my knowledge... ...that there's a difference 'twixt false and true. And as I find no kind of hero... ...more to be admired than men of true religion. Nothing is more noble or more beautiful... ...than is the holy zeal of true devoutness. Just so I think there's naught more odious... ...than whited sepulchres of outward zeal... ...that those barefaced charlatans... ...those hireling zealots... ...whose sacrilegious, treacherous pretence... ...deceives at will, and with impunity, ..makes mockery of all that mortals hold sacred. People who, enslaved to selfish interests... ...make trade of godliness and merchandise... ...and try to buy influence and office, by eye-rollings and affected raptures. Those men, I say... ...who with uncommon zeal seek their fortune on the road to heaven... ...who, skilled in prayer, have always much to ask... ...and live at court to preach retirement... Who reconcile religion with their vices... Are quick to anger, vengeful, faithless, tricky... And, to destroy a man, will have the boldness ...to call their private grudge the cause of heaven. All the more dangerous, as in their rage they use against us weapons we revere. And since they make the world applaud their passion... ...and seek to stab us with a sacred sword. There are too many of this canting kind. Still, the sincere ones are easy to distinguish. In our own time, before our very eyes... ...many fine examples may be found... Look at Ariston, Periandre, Oronte... Alcidamas, Polydore, Clitandre. No one denies their claim to true religion. Yet they're no braggadocios of virtue. They don't make insufferable display... And their religion is human, tractable. They are not always judging all our actions. They'd think such judgment savoured of presumption. And, leaving pride of words to other men... 'Tis by their deeds alone they censure ours. Evil appearances find little credit. They even incline to think the best of others. They've no cabals and no intrigues to carry on. They mind the business of their own right living. They don't attack a sinner tooth and nail... For sin's the only object of their hatred. Nor are they over-zealous to attempt... ...far more on heaven's behalf than heaven would have them. That's my kind of man... ...and the true way of living. That is the pattern we should set ourselves. Your fellow was not fashioned on this model... You're quite sincere in boasting of his zeal. But you're deceived, I think, by false pretences. My dear brother-in-law, have you quite done? Yes. I'm your humble servant. Please, just a word, my brother. We'll drop that other subject. But you know Valere has had your promise of your daughter. Yes. You've appointed a day for the wedding? That's true. - I can't say. Can you have some other plan in mind? Perhaps. - You mean to break your word? - I don't say that. I hope no obstacle can keep you from fulfilling your promise. - Depends. - Can you not give me a simple answer? Valere has sent me here to settle matters. Heaven be praised! What answer shall I take him? Why, anything you please. But we must know your plans. What are they? I shall do the will of Heaven. Come, be serious. Does Valere have your promise or not? Goodbye. His love, methinks, has much to fear. I must let him know what's happening here. Marianne? Father? Come here. I've something to tell you in secret. What are you looking for? To see there's no one there to spy upon us. That little closet's a good place to hide in. There! We're all right now. Mariane, in you I've always found a daughter, dutiful and gentle. At all times you've been very dear to me. I'm very grateful for your fatherly affection. Well spoken, daughter. Now prove you deserve it... ...by doing as I wish in all respects. To do just that is the height of my ambition. Excellent! What do you say of Tartuffe, our guest? - Who me? - Yes, you. And take care how you answer. Alas! I'll say of him anything that you wish. That's wisely said. Tell me then, daughter... ...that all his person shines with noble merit... That he has won your heart, and that you would be pleased to see him, by my choice become my husband. Eh? What's the matter? - Beg your pardon? - What? Am I mistaken? How? Who is it, father, you would have me say... ...has won my heart... ...and I would be pleased to have by your choice... ...to become my husband? -Tartuffe. But, father, I protest, it isn't true! Why should you make me tell this dreadful lie? Because I mean to have it be the truth... So let it suffice for you, that it's settled. - You'd want to, father...? - Yes. I'm resolved, my daughter, to bring Tartuffe... ...into my family, by marriage. So he must be your husband. That's what I've resolved. And I charge you on your duty... What are you doing there? Your curiosity is keen, my girl... ...to make you come eavesdropping on us so. I don't know how the rumour got started... If it was guess-work or mere chance. But I had heard news already of this match... ...and treated it as utter stuff and nonsense. What! Is the matter so incredible? So much so, I don't believe it, even from yourself, Sir. I know a way to make you credit it. Oh yes, you'll tell us some droll tale. I'm telling you just what will happen shortly. Piffle! I promise you, this is no jest. Don't take your father seriously. He's playing the fool. I assure you... No use... You won't be believed. My anger is rising...! Well, then, we do believe you, and the worse for you it is. Can it be Sir... ...that with an air of wisdom and an impressive beard... ...you can be crazy enough to want... Listen... You've been taking certain liberties of late... ...that don't please me at all, let me tell you my girl! Let's not get angry, Sir, I beg you. You must be laughing at everyone, to come up with this scheme. Your daughter's not cut out for bigot's meat. And surely he has more important things to think on. Besides, what can you gain by such a match? How can a man of wealth, like you... ...go choose a wretched vagabond for son-in-law? Be quiet! The less he has, the better cause we have to honour him. Without a doubt, his poverty is honest poverty. It should exalt him more than worldly grandeur... ...for he has let himself be robbed of all... ...through careless disregard of temporal things... ...and fixed attachment to the things eternal. But my help may allow him the means... ...of getting out of trouble and recovering his possessions. He has title to an estate of renown. And as we can see, he's a true gentleman Yes, so he says himself. Such vanity but ill accords with pious living, sir. The man who embraces the simplicity of a holy life... ...Should not so loudly boast his name and birth. The humble ways of genuine devoutness... ...brook not so much display of earthly pride. Why should he be so vain? But I offend you. Let's leave his rank, then, and take the man himself. Can you, without compunction, give a man like him... ...possession of a girl like her? Should you not consult propriety... ...and foresee the consequences of such a union? Virtue is at the mercy of the fates... ...when a girl marries to a man she truly hates. The best intent to live an honest woman... ...depends upon the husband's being human. And men whose acts are pointed at afar... ...may thank themselves their wives are what they are. For to be true is more than woman can... ...with husbands built upon a certain plan. And he who weds his child against her will... ...owes heaven account for it, if she do ill. Think then what perils wait on your design. I tell you, I must teach her how to live. You might do worse than follow my advice. Daughter, we can't waste time upon this nonsense. I know what's good for you... and I'm your father. True, I had promised you to young Valere. But, first, they tell me he's inclined to gamble... ...and then, I fear his faith is not quite sound. I haven't noticed that he's regular at church. You'd have him run there at the time you are... ...like those who go on purpose to be seen? I don't ask your opinion on the matter. In short, that man is in Heaven's best graces... ...and that is riches quite beyond compare. This match will bring you every joy you long for. 'Twill be all steeped in sweetness and delight. You'll live together, in your faithful loves... ...like two sweet children, like two turtle-doves. You'll never suffer quarrel, scold, or tease... ...and you may do with him whate'er you please. Her? She'll only make a fool of him, I'll warrant. What a thing to say! I say that he has the look of it, and his destiny will overbear... ...all the virtue that your daughter may have. Have done with interrupting and hold your tongue... Don't poke your nose in other people's business. If I make bold, sir, 'tis for your own good. You're too officious... pray you, hold your tongue! If it wasn't for love of you... I want none of your love. Then I will love you in spite of yourself. Your honour is dear to me. I can't endure to see you made the butt of all men's ridicule. Won't you be silent? 'Twould be a sin to let you make this match. Won't you be quiet, I say, you impudent viper! What! You are pious, and you lose your temper? Yes. I'm all wrought up, with your confounded nonsense. Now, once and for all, I tell you hold your tongue! So be it. But if I don't say it, I'll think it all the more. Think all you want. But take care I hear none of your thoughts. Enough!! As a wise father, I've considered all with due deliberation. I'll go mad if I can't speak. Without being a ladies man Tartuffe is still quite... He's got a fine phiz. So that, although you may not care at all for his best qualities … She'll be well off. Were I in her place, any man would rue it... ...who married me by force, that's mighty certain. I'd let him know, and that within a week... ...a woman's vengeance isn't far to seek. So...nothing that I say has any weight? Why do you complain? I didn't speak to you. - So what were you doing? - Talking to myself. Very well . Her monstrous impudence must be chastised... ...by giving her a good slap. Daughter, you must approve of my intent... ...and believe... ...that this husband I have chosen for you… Why don't you talk to yourself? - Nothing to say. - One little word more? - I’ve no mind to it. - Surely, I was watching you. Faith, I'm no such fool. So, daughter, you must show obedience... ...and accept my choice with deference. You'd never catch me marrying such a creature. Daughter, you've such a pestilent hussy there... I can't live with her longer, without sin. I can't discuss things in the state I'm in. My mind's so flustered by her insolent talk... ...to calm myself, I must go take a walk. Have you lost the tongue from out your head? And must I speak your role from A to Zed? You let them broach a project that's absurd... ...and don't oppose it with a single word! What can I do? My father is the master. Do? Everything, to ward off such disaster. - But what? - Tell him one doesn't love by proxy. Tell him you'll marry for yourself, not him. Since you're the one for whom the thing is done... ...you're the one, not he, the man must please. And if his Tartuffe has charmed him so... ...no one will stop him marrying him himself. A father's rights are such, it seems to me... ...that I could never dare say such a thing. Let's talk it out. Valere has asked you for your hand... Now do you love him, pray, or do you not? Dorine! How can you do injustice to my love... ...and ask me such a question? A hundred times I've laid bare my heart to you. Do you know how ardently I love him? How do I know if heart and words agree... ...and if in honest truth you really love him? Dorine, you wrong me greatly if you doubt it. I've shown my inmost feelings, all too plainly. So then, you love him? Yes, devotedly. And he returns your love, it seems? I think so. And you both alike are eager to be well married to each other? Most certainly. Then what's your plan about this other match? To kill myself, if it is forced upon me. Good! That's a remedy I'd not considered. Just die, and everything will be all right! That medicine is marvellous, indeed! It drives me mad to hear folk talk such nonsense. Oh dear...! Dorine you get in such a temper! You have no sympathy for people's troubles. I have no sympathy when folk talk nonsense... ...and give way, as you're inclined to do. But what can you expect... if one is timid? Heartfelt love requires firmness of mind. Am I not constant in my love for Valere? Is it not his place to win me from my father? What? If your father is a crazy fool... ...and quite bewitched with his Tartuffe? ...and breaks his bounden word... Is that the fault of your lover? But shall I publicly refuse and scorn this match... ..and show to all how much I am in love? Shall I cast off for him, whate'er he be, womanly modesty and filial duty? Would you want my love become the talk of the town? No, no, I want nothing. I see you wish to be Mr Tartuffe's. Why, now I think of it, I'd be wrong to turn you from this marriage. What cause can I have to oppose your wishes? The match itself is an excellent one. Mr Tartuffe! Oh ho! That's no mean proposal! Mr Tartuffe, sure, taking it all in all... ...is not a man to be sneezed at... oh, by no means! 'Tis no small luck to be his happy spouse. The whole world sings his praise already; He's noble... in his parish, handsome too. Red ears and high complexion You'll surely be happy with him for a husband. My God... What joy and pride will fill your heart, to be bride to such a handsome fellow! Stop it! I beg you, try to find some way... ...to help break off the match. I quite give in... I'm ready to do anything you say. No, no, a daughter must obey her father... ...though he should want to have her wed a monkey. Besides, you've drawn a prize. What are you complaining about? You'll take the stage-coach to his little village... ...and find it full of uncles and of cousins... ...whose conversation will delight you. Then you'll be presented to their best society. You'll even go to call, by way of welcome... ...on Mrs Bailiff, Mrs Tax-Collector... ...who'll patronise you with a camp-stool. There, once a year, at carnival, you'll have perhaps a ball... ...with an orchestra of two bagpipes. And sometimes a trained ape, and Punch and Judy... You'll be the death of me. Do try to help me with advice. Your obedient servant! Oh! Dorine... I beg of you… To serve you right, this marriage must go through. My dear girl! No. If my declared wishes... No, no. Tartuffe's your man, and you shall taste him. You know I've always trusted you. Now help me! No, my faith, you'll be Tartuffe-ified. Well then... ...since you've no pity for my fate... ...leave me entirely to my despair. It will advise and help and give me courage. And there's one sure cure, I know, for all my troubles. Hey! There, there! Come back. I can't be angry long. I must take pity on you, after all. Oh, don't you see... ...if I must bear this martyrdom... ...I tell you Dorine, I shall certainly shall die. Now don't you fret. We'll surely find some way. to hinder this. But here's Valere, your lover. I've just been told some news, Madame... ...which I didn't know, and which is certainly good. What? That you are marrying Tartuffe. 'Tis true my father has this plan in mind. Your father, Madame… ...has changed his mind. It has just been proposed to me. What? Seriously? Yes, he was serious. He has strongly insisted on the match. And just what... ...have you determined in the matter, Madame? I don't know. That's a straightforward answer. - You don't know? - No. "No" ? What do you advise? My advice to you... ...is to marry him. That's your advice? - Yes. - Do you mean it? Certainly. A splendid choice, and worthy of your acceptance. Well then... ...I shall accept your advice, Sir. You'll find no trouble taking it, I warrant. No more than you did giving it, be sure. I gave it, truly, to oblige you, Madame. ..and I shall take it to oblige you, Sir. Let's see what this affair will come to. So this is your affection? And it was all deceit , when... I beg you, say no more of that. You told me, squarely, I should accept the husband that is offered me... ...and I will tell you squarely that I mean to do so... ...since you have given me this good advice. Don't shield yourself with talk of my advice. You had your mind made up. And now you snatch at a trifling pretext to justify the breaking of your word. - Exactly so. - Of course. Your heart has never known true love for me. Alas! You're free to think so, if you wish. Yes, I may think so. And my outraged love may be ahead of you in your perfidy... and offer elsewhere both my heart and hand. No doubt of it... ...the love your deserts may win. Good Lord, have done with my deserts! I know I have but few, and you have proved it. But I hope I may find more kindness in another... I know of someone, who'll not be ashamed... ...to take your leavings, and make up my loss. The loss is not so great. You'll easily console yourself completely for this change. I'll try my best, that you may well believe. A heart that forgets us, challenges our pride. We must use all our efforts to forget. Or if we cannot, must at least pretend to. In faith, a high and noble sentiment. ...as be a lover scorned, and still in love. This feeling, no doubt, is noble and elevated. It is. One that all men must approve. What?! Would you have me keep my love alive... ...and see you fly into another's arms... ...before my very eyes, and never offer... ...to someone else the heart that you had scorned? Oh, no, indeed! For my part, I could wish that it were done already. What! You wish it? This is insult heaped on injury... I'll go at once and do as you desire. Very well. But remember this... ...'twas you that drove me to this desperate pass... ...and in the plan that I have formed, I only follow your example. - My example, so be it. - Enough! - You shall be punctually obeyed. - So much the better. You see me now for the last time ever! So be it, then! - Eh? - What? You didn't call me? Me? You are dreaming. Very well! I'll be on my way. Goodbye, Madame. Goodbye, Sir. I must say, you've both lost your senses in this folly. I've let you fight it out to the end to see how far the thing could go. Hear me, Mr Valere. What do you want, Dorine? - Come here. - No. No, my vexation overpowers me. Don't hinder me from doing as she wants. Stop. No. Don't you see I've made up my mind? It pains him to see me. My presence drives him away. It would be for the best that I leave this place. Where are you running to? - Let me be. - Come back! No, no, Dorine. It's no use trying to hold me. 'Tis clear the sight of me is torture to her. No doubt, t'were better I should free her from it. Same thing again! Deuce take the two of you! Stop with this nonsense and come here the both of you! But what is your intention? What can you mean to do? Set you to rights, and pull you out of this scrape. Are you quite mad, to quarrel like this? Didn't you hear the things she said to me? Are you quite mad, to get in such a passion? Didn't you see it all, and the way he treated me? Folly on both sides. She thinks of nothing else but to be yours, I swear to it. And he loves none but you... ...and longs for nothing but just to marry you... I stake my life on't. Why did you give me such advice then, pray? Why ask for my advice on such a matter? You both are daft, I tell you. Here, give me your hands. Come, yours. What do you want it for? Ah! Now, yours. - But what's the use? - Good God, just do it! You love each other better than you think. Come, don't be so ungracious now about it... Look at a man as if you didn't hate him. My faith and troth, what fools these lovers be! My word! But come now, have I not a just complaint? And truly, are you not a wicked creature... ...to take delight in saying what would pain me? And are you not yourself the most ungrateful…? Leave this discussion till another time... ...and consider how you'll stave off this wretched marriage. Tell us then what devices we must employ. We'll try all sorts of ways. Your father's daft and it's poppycock. But you'd better humour his notions by a semblance of consent... ...so that in case of danger, you can still find means... ...to block the marriage by delay. If you gain time, the rest is easy, trust me. Sometimes you can put them off with some illness... ...which comes suddenly, and causes delay. Or you may put them off, with ill omens. You unluckily met a funeral, or broke a looking-glass... ...or dreamt of muddy water. Best of all... ...they cannot marry you to anyone, without your saying "yes". But in order to succeed, it seems to me... ...that no one should find you talking together. You, go at once and set your friends at work... ...to make him keep his word to you. We will bring the brother's influence to bear... ...and get the step-mother on our side, too. Goodbye. Whatever efforts we may make... ...my greatest hope, be sure, must rest on you. I cannot answer for my father's whims... ...but no one save Valere shall ever have me. You thrill me through with joy! Whatever comes… Oho! These lovers! Never done with prattling! - Now go, I tell you. - But... What chatterboxes! Now you go this way... And you go the other way. May lightning strike me dead this very instant... May I be everywhere proclaimed a scoundrel... ...if any reverence or power shall stop me... ...from doing straightaway some desperate act. I beg you, moderate this towering passion... Your father did but merely mention it. Not all things that are talked of turn to facts... The road is long, sometimes, from plans to acts. No, I must end this coxcomb's plots... ...and he shall hear from me a truth or two. Gently now! As for him, as well as your father... ...let your step-mother deal with it. She has some influence with this Tartuffe. He makes a point of heeding all she says... ..and maybe he could be fond of her. I wish to heaven it were so. It would be a fine affair! Now... ...she has sent for him, in your behalf... ...to sound him on this marriage that troubles you... ...to find out what his ideas are... ...and to show him plainly what troubles he may cause... ...if he persists in giving countenance to this design. His man says he's at prayers, and I may not see him... But likewise he says, he'll presently be down. So be off with you, and let me wait for him. I should be present at this interview. - No! They must be alone. - I won't say a word. You jest? We know your tantrums and how they can ruin things. - Now leave! - No! I shall see him and stay calm. How troublesome you are! He's coming! Get out of sight! Laurent! Lock up my sack-cloth shirt with my scourge... ...and pray that Heaven may shed its light upon you. If any come to see me, say I'm gone, to share my alms among the prisoners. What affectation and boastfulness! - What do you want? - To tell you... My God... Before you speak, pray take this handkerchief. What? Cover up that bosom, which I can't endure to see. Such things offend our souls... ...and fill our minds with sinful thoughts. Are you so open to temptation, then. Has the flesh such power upon your senses? I don't know how you get in such a heat... For my part, I'm not so prone to lust... And I could see you naked from head to toe... ...and all your flesh not tempt me in the least. Show in your speech some little modesty... ...or I must instantly take leave of you. No, 'tis I who'll leave you to yourself. I've only one thing to say... . Madame will soon be down, and begs the favour of a word with you. Oh, most willingly. How gentle all at once! But faith, I still stand by what I've said of him. Will she come soon? I think I hear her now. Yes, here she is herself... I'll leave you be together. May Heaven's overflowing kindness... ...ever give you good health of body and of soul.... ...and bless your days according to the wishes... ...and prayers of its most humble votary! I'm very grateful for your pious wishes. But let us be seated, so we may talk at ease. And how are you recovering from your illness? Quite well. The fever soon let go its hold. My prayers, I fear, have not sufficient merit... ...to have drawn down this favour from on high. But each entreaty that I made to Heaven... ...had only for its object, your recovery. Your zeal for me was too solicitous. One could never cherish your dear health too much. I would have given mine, to help restore it. That's pushing Christian charity too far. I owe you many thanks for so much kindness. I do far less for you than you deserve. There is a matter that I wished to speak of in private... I'm glad there's no one here to listen. Madame, I am overjoyed. 'Tis certainly sweet to find myself alone with you. This is a chance I've asked of Heaven, many a time till now, in vain. All that I wish to have from you... ...is just a word from you, quite frank and open... ...hiding nothing from me. I too could wish, as Heaven's special favour... ...to lay my soul quite open to your eyes... ...and swear to you, the trouble that I made... ...About those visits which your charms attract... ...did not come out of any hatred toward you... ...but rather from a passionate devotion... ...and purest motives. That is how I take it. I think 'tis my salvation that concerns you. Madame, 'tis so... And... ...such is my devotion… Ouch! You squeeze too hard. It's excess of zeal. In no way could I ever mean to hurt you. And I'd just as soon… What's your hand doing there? Feeling your gown... the cloth is very soft. Be so kind as to let it be. I am very ticklish. My God... ...how wonderful in workmanship this lace is! They do marvels, nowadays... Things of all kinds were never better made. Very true. But let us get down to business. They say my husband means to break his word... ...and give you his daughter. Is it true? Tell me. He did mention it to me. But truly, Madame, that's not the happiness I'm yearning for. I see elsewhere the sweet compelling charms... ...of such a joy as fills my every wish. Does that mean you cannot love terrestrial things? My bosom doesn't hold a heart that's made of stone. I well believe your sighs all tend to Heaven... ...and nothing here below can stay your thoughts. Love for the beauty of eternal things... ...cannot destroy our love for earthly beauty. Our mortal senses may well be entranced... ...by perfect works that Heaven has created. Its charms shine reflected in such as you... ...and in yourself, its rarest miracles. It has displayed such marvels in your face... ...that eyes are dazed, and hearts are rapt away. I could not look on you, the perfect creature... ...without admiring Nature's great Creator... ...and feeling all my heart inflamed with love for you... ...his fairest image of Himself.. At first I trembled lest this secret love... ...might be the Evil Spirit's artful snare. I even schooled my heart to flee your beauty... ...thinking it was a bar to my salvation. But at length I saw... ...O all lovely one... ...how this my passion may be blameless... ...how I may make it fit with modesty... ...and thus yield my heart completely to it. 'Tis I must own, a great presumption in me... ...to dare make you the offer of my heart. My love hopes all things from your perfect goodness... ...and nothing from my own poor weak endeavour. In you... ...are my hope, my stay, my peace of heart. On you depends my torment... ...or my bliss. And by your doom of judgment, I shall be... ...blesst, if you will, ...or damned, by your decree. Your declaration's turned most gallantly. But truly, it is just a bit surprising. You should have better armed your heart, methinks... ...and taken thought somewhat on such a matter. A pious man like you, known everywhere… Ah! Though pious, I am none the less a man. And when a man beholds your heavenly charms... ...the heart surrenders, and can think no more. I know such words seem strange, to come from me; But Madame... after all... ...I am not an angel. If you condemn the avowal that I've made... ...you only have your charming self to blame. As soon as I saw your more than human beauty... ...you were thenceforth the sovereign of my soul. Sweetness ineffable was in your eyes... ...that took by storm my still resisting heart... ...and conquered everything... ...fasts, prayers, and tears... ...And turned my worship wholly to your charms. My looks, my sighs, have spoke a thousand times. Now, to express it all, my voice must speak. If but you will look down with gracious favour... ...upon the sorrows of your worthless slave... If in your goodness you will give me comfort... ...and condescend unto my nothingness... ...I'll ever pay you, O sweet miracle... ..an unexampled worship and devotion. Then too, with me your honour runs no risk. With me you need not fear a public scandal. Those court gallants, that women are so fond of... ...are boastful of their acts, and vain in speech. They always brag in public of their progress. Soon as a favour's granted, they'll divulge it... and their tattling tongues, if you but trust to them, ...Will foul the altar where their hearts have worshipped. But men like me are so discreet in love... ...that you may trust my lasting secrecy. The care we take to guard our own good name... ...may fully guarantee the one we love. So you may find, with hearts like ours sincere, ...love without scandal, pleasure without fear. I've heard you through... ...and explain yourself in the strongest of terms. But don't you fear that I may take a fancy.. ...to tell my husband of your gallant passion... ...and that a prompt report of this affair... ...may somewhat change the friendship which he bears you? I know that you're too good and generous... ...and that you will pardon my temerity... ...and excuse, upon the score of human frailty... ...the violence of passion that offends you... ...and not forget, when you consult your mirror... ...that I'm not blind... ...and man is made of flesh. Some women might do otherwise, perhaps, But I am willing to employ discretion... ...and not repeat the matter to my husband. But in return, I'll ask one thing of you... That you urge forward, frankly and sincerely... ...the marriage of Valere to Mariane. That you give up the unjust influence... ...by which you hope to win another's rights. No. Madame, no. No! This must be made public. I was just there, and overheard it all. And Heaven's goodness must have brought me there... ...on purpose to confound this scoundrel's pride... ...and grant me means to take a signal vengeance... ...on his hypocrisy and arrogance. And undeceive my father, showing up in plain view... ...the rascal caught at making love to you. No, Damis... ...it is enough if he reforms... ...endeavouring to deserve the favour shown him. And since I've made a promise, don't you dare belie me. 'Tis not my way to make a public scandal. An honest wife will scorn to heed such follies... ...and never fret her husband's ears with them. You've reasons of your own for acting thus... ...and I have mine for doing otherwise. To spare him now would be a mockery. His bigot's pride has triumphed all too long over my righteous anger... ...and has caused far too much trouble in our family. The rascal has ruled my father all too long... ...and crossed my sister's love, and mine as well. His perfidy must be unmasked... ...and Providence has given me the means to do it. I am most thankful for the opportunity... ...and it's too favourable to be neglected. I would deserve to have it taken from me if I were to waste it. - Damis. - No. No, by your leave, I'll follow my own counsel. My heart is filled with joy. Anything you said to dissuade me in my revenge, would be in vain. Without further ado, I'll make an end to this affair. And here is what will give me my satisfaction Father we shall entertain you with an incident, just happened... ...that's altogether novel, and surprising. You are well paid for your caressing care... ...and this fine gentleman rewards your love most handsomely. His great zeal for you has just gone so far... ...as to wish to bring dishonour upon you. I've just surprised him making your wife the shameful offer of a guilty love. She, somewhat over gentle and discreet... ...insisted that the thing should be concealed. But I will not condone such shamelessness... ...nor so far wrong you, as to keep it secret. Yes... I believe a wife should never trouble her husband's peace of mind... ...with such vain gossip. A woman's honour does not hang on telling... It is enough if she defend herself... Or so I think. Damis... ...you'd not have spoken, if you would but have heeded my advice. Heavens above! Can what I hear be credited? Yes, brother... I am wicked. I am guilty. A miserable sinner, steeped in evil. The greatest criminal that ever lived. Each moment of my life is stained with blemishes. And all is but a mass of crime and filth. Heaven, for my punishment, I see it plainly... ...would mortify me on this occasion. Whatever wrong they find to charge me with... ...I've not sufficient pride to ever deny it. Believe their stories, arm your wrath against me... ...and drive me like a villain from your house. I cannot have so great a share of shame... ...but what I have deserved a greater still. You villain...! Can you dare, with such a falsehood... ...attempt to tarnish the purity of his virtue? What? The feigned meekness of this hypocrite makes you discredit…? You cursed plague! Hold your tongue! Let him speak... You blame him wrongfully... You'd do far better to believe what he says. Why favour me so much in such a matter? How can you know... ...after all, of what I'm capable? And should you trust my outward semblance, brother... ...or judge therefrom that I'm the better man? No. No. You let appearances deceive you... And I am anything but, alas... ...what I'm thought to be. Everyone thinks of me as being a good man... ...but the simple truth is, I'm a worthless creature. Yes, my dear boy, speak on... Call me treacherous, infamous... reprobate, thief and murderer. Heap on me names yet more detestable... ...and I shall not gainsay you... I've deserved them. I'll bear this ignominy on my knees... ...to expiate in shame the crimes I've done. Ah, brother, 'tis too much! You'll not relent, you blackguard? What? His talk can so deceive you that... Silence, scoundrel! My brother, rise, I beg of you. Infamous wretch! - He can... - Shut up! I'm furious. What? Am I taken for... Another word, I'll break your every bone! Brother, in God's name, don't be angry with him! I'd rather suffer the greatest pain... ...than have him get a scratch on my account. - Ungrateful monster! - Leave him be. Upon my knees, I beg you pardon him… Alas! How can you? Villain! Behold his goodness! - So... - Quiet! - What? I... - Quiet, I say! I know your motives for this attack. You hate him, all of you. I've seen today... ...wife, children, servants, all let loose upon him. You have recourse to every shameful trick... ...to drive this godly man out of my house. The more you strive to rid yourselves of him... ...the more I'll strive to make him stay with me. I'll have him straightway married to my daughter... ...just to confound the pride of all my family. What! Will you force her to accept his hand? Yes, villain... And this very evening, just to plague you. Ah! I'll defy you all... ...and show that I will be obeyed, for I'm the master. Now, down upon your knees this instant, rogue... ..and take back what you said, and ask his pardon. Who, me? Ask pardon of that cheating scoundrel… ? Do you resist, you wretch, and call him names? A cudgel! a cudgel! Don't restrain me. Off with you! Leave my house this instant, sirrah... ...and never dare set foot in it again. Yes, I will leave your house, but … Quickly! Leave this place! You reprobate, I disinherit you... ...and give you, too, my curse into the bargain. What! To so insult a saintly man of God! Heaven... ...forgive him all the pain he gives me! If you should know what trouble it is to me... ...that they should try to blacken me to my dear brother. Alas! The mere thought of such ingratitude makes my soul suffer torture, bitterly. Oh, the horror of it! My heart's so full I cannot speak... - It'll be the death of me. - Scoundrel! I wish I'd never let you go... ...but slain you on the spot with my own hand. Brother, compose yourself, and don't be angry. Let us put an end to these painful quarrels. I see what troublous times I bring upon you... ...and think 'tis needful that I leave this house. What? You surely jest? Yes, they hate me here... ...and try, I find, to make you doubt my faith. What of it? Do you find I listen to them? No doubt they won't stop there. These same reports you now reject, may some day win a hearing. No, my brother, never. My brother... ...a woman may easily mislead her husband's mind. No. No. So let me quickly go away and thus remove all cause for such attacks. No, you shall stay... My life depends upon it. Well then... I must mortify myself. However, if you wish... No! So be it. No more of that. But I know how to act, to fit the occasion. Honour is a tender thing... Friendship binds me to forestall rumours and causes for offence. I'll shun your wife, and you will never see me. No, in spite of all, you'll keep to her company. 'Tis my delight to set them in a rage... I want you to be seen together at all hours. And what is more, the better to defy them... ...I'll have no other heir but you. Straightway I'll go and make a deed of gift to you... ...drawn in due form, of all my estate. A good true friend, my son-in-law to be... ...is more to me than son, and wife, and kindred. You will accept my offer, will you not? Heaven's will be done in every thing! Poor man! Yes, let me tell you, it's the talk of the town... ...and then let envy burst itself with spite! Yes, it's become the talk of all the town. The stir it's caused is scarcely to your credit. I've met you, sir, most opportunely... ...to tell you in a word my frank opinion. I'll not sift out this scandal to the bottom... I'll pass that by, and come straight to what's worst. Let us suppose that Damis has used you ill... ...and that you were wrongfully accused. Should not a Christian pardon this offence... ...and stifle in his heart all wish for vengeance? Should you permit that, for your petty quarrel... ...a son be driven from his father's house? I tell you yet again, and tell you frankly... ...every person, high or low, is scandalised. If you'll take my advice, you'll make it up... ...and not push matters to extremities. Make sacrifice to God of your resentment... ...and restore a son to his father's favour. Alas! So far as I'm concerned, how gladly would I do so! I bear him Sir, no ill will at all. I pardon all, lay nothing to his charge... ...and wish with all my heart that I might serve him. But... ...Heaven's interests cannot let it happen. If he returns... ...then I must leave the house. After his conduct, quite unparalleled... ...all intercourse between us would bring scandal. God knows what everyone's first thought would be! They'd attribute it to mere scheming on my part... ...and say that conscious of my guilt... ...I feigned a Christian love for my accuser... ...but feared him in my heart, and hoped to win him... ...to be able to underhandedly secure his silence. You try to put us off with specious phrases... ...but all your arguments are too far-fetched. Why take upon yourself the cause of Heaven? Does Heaven need our help to punish sinners? Leave to itself the care of its own vengeance... ...and keep in mind the pardon it commands us. Besides, think somewhat less of men's opinions... ...when you are following the will of Heaven. What? Shall petty fear of what the world may think... ...prevent the doing of a noble deed? No! Let us always do as Heaven commands... ...and not perplex our minds with further questions. Already I have told you I forgive him... ...and that is doing, Sir, as Heaven commands. But after this day's scandal and affront... ...Heaven does not order me to live with him. And does it order you to lend your ear... ...to that which mere caprice suggested to his father... ...and to accept gift of his estates... ...on which, in justice, you can make no claim? No one who knows me, sir, can have the thought... ...that I am acting from a selfish motive. All the riches of this world have no charms for me. I am not dazzled by their treacherous glamour. And if I bring myself to take the father's gift... ...which he insists on giving me... ...I do so, to tell the truth, only because I fear... ...this whole estate may fall into bad hands. And those to whom it comes, may use it to ill purpose in this world... ...and not employ it, as is my design... ...for Heaven's glory and my neighbours' good. Oh, Sir... ...give up these conscientious scruples... ...that well may cause the rightful heir's complaints. Don't take so much upon yourself... ...but let him have what's his, at his own risk and peril. Consider, it were better he misused it... ...than you should be accused of robbing him. I am astounded that unblushingly, you could allow such offers to be made! Tell me... has true religion any maxim that teaches us to rob the lawful heir? If Heaven has made it quite impossible... ...that Damis and you should live together here... ...were it not better you should quietly... ...and honourably withdraw... ...than let the son, against all reason... ...be driven from the house for your sake? Believe me... ...'twould be giving such an example of your probity, Sir. Sir, it is half-past three. Certain devotions recall me to my closet. You'll forgive me for leaving you so soon. Ah! Sir, we beg you help us all you can in her behalf. She's suffering almost more than heart can bear. The match her father means to make, this night... ...drives her each moment to despair. He's coming! Let's unite our efforts now, we beg you... ...and try by strength or cunning to change this plan.... ...which troubles us so fearfully. Ah! I'm very glad to find you all together. Here is the contract that shall make you smile... You know already what it means. Oh father... ...in the name of Heaven that knows my grief... ...and by whate'er can move your heart... ...relax a little your paternal rights... ...and free my love from this obedience! Do not make me, by your harsh command... ...complain to Heaven you ever were my father. Do not make wretched this poor life you gave me. If, crossing that fond hope which I had formed... ...you'll stop me from one, who I have dared to love... ...at least, I beg you upon my knees... ...save me from the torment of being with one I loathe... ...and do not drive me to some desperate act... ...by exercising all your rights upon me. Come, come, my heart, be firm! Yield to no human weakness! I am not jealous of your love for him. Display it freely... give him your estate... ...and if that's not enough, add all of mine. I willingly agree, and give it up. If only you'll not give him me, your daughter. Oh, rather let a convent's rigid rule... ...wear out the wretched days that Heaven allots me. Those girls that always change to nuns... ...when fathers thwart their silly love-affairs! Stand up! The more you hate to have him... ...the more 'twill help you earn your soul's salvation. So, mortify your senses... by this marriage... ...and cease vexing me about it any more. But what...? Hold your tongue before your betters! Don't dare to say a single word, I tell you. If you would just allow me to advise you... Brother, I value your advice most highly. 'Tis well thought out; no better can be had. But you'll allow me... not to follow it. Seeing what I see... ...I can't find the words to say... Your blindness makes me quite astounded at you. You are quite bewitched by him... ...to refuse to believe us as to what happened today. I am your humble servant... ...and believe in appearances. I know you're partial to my rascal son... ...and didn't dare to disavow the trick... ...he tried to play on this poor man. You were too calm, to be believed. Had it happened, you'd have been far more disturbed. At the mere mention of illicit love... ...must our honour always rush to arms? Or can we answer no attack upon it... ...except with blazing eyes and lips of scorn? For my part, I just laugh away such nonsense... I've no desire to make a loud to-do. Our virtue should, I think, be gentle-natured. Nor can I quite approve those savage prudes... ...whose honour arms itself with teeth and claws... ...to tear men's eyes out at the slightest word. Heaven preserve me from that kind of honour! I like my virtue not to be a vixen... ...and I believe a quiet cold rebuff... ...no less effective to repulse a lover. I know the whole affair... Nothing will change me. I still wonder at your strange weakness. But I wonder how your disbelief would answer... ...if I should let you see we've told the truth? - SEE it? - Yes. - Nonsense. - What is? If I find a way to show you, clear as day? - Just flimflam!. - What a man! At least answer me. I'm not proposing now that you believe us... But supposing here that we can find a place... ...where you can clearly see and hear all that's said... ...what would you say then, to your man of virtue? Why, then, I'd say… I'd say nothing. It can't happen. Your error has endured too long already... ...and for quite too long you've branded me a liar. I must at once, and for my own satisfaction... ...make you a witness of the things we've told you. So be it. I take you at your word. We'll see what tricks you have... ...and how you will make good your promise. Send him to me. The man's a crafty codger... Perhaps you'll find it difficult to catch him out. No... A lover's never hard to cheat... ...and self-conceit leads straight to self-deceit. Bid him come down to me. And you both go away. Come here and get under this table. What for? To have you well hidden, is most important. But why under this table? For Heaven's sake, just do it! I know what I'm about, as you shall see. Get under, now, I tell you. And once you're there... ...be careful no one either sees or hears you. I must say, I'm going a long way to humour you... ...but I'll see you through your scheme. And then you'll have, I think, no more to say. But be aware, I'll be getting myself into some strange business. Don't let yourself be shocked by anything. Whatever I may say must pass, because... ...'tis only to convince you, as I promised. By wheedling speeches, since I'm forced to do it... ...I'll make this hypocrite put off his mask... ...flatter the longings of his shameless passion... ...and give free play to all his impudence. Since 'tis for your sake alone... ...to prove his guilt that I feign compliance with his wishes. I can leave off as soon as you're convinced... ...and things shall go no farther than you choose. It is for you to stop his mad pursuit... ...when you think things have gone quite far enough... ...to spare your wife, and not expose me farther... ...than you shall need, yourself, to undeceive you. This is your own affair... ...and you will be the master of it... Here he comes. Keep still. Take care not to show yourself. They told me you wished to speak to me here. Yes. I have secrets for your ear alone. But shut the door, before I tell you... ...and look everywhere for fear of surprise. Another scene like that we had just now... ...is something we can ill afford. Was ever anyone so caught before!? Damis did frighten me most terribly on your account. And you saw I did my very best... ...to baffle his design, and calm his anger. It's true that I was so troubled... so greatly confused... ...I never thought to contradict his story. Still, thank Heaven... ...things turned out all the better... ...and now we're on an even safer footing. The high esteem you're held in, laid the storm. My husband can have no suspicion of you... ...and even insists, to spite the scandal-mongers... ...that we shall be together... ...at all times. And that is how I can... ...without the risk of blame... ...find myself here... ...locked up with you alone. And can reveal to you my heart, perhaps... ...only too ready to allow your passion. Your words are somewhat hard to understand, Madame... Just now, you used a different style. Ah...! If that refusal has offended you... ...how little do you know a woman's heart! How ill you guess what it would have you know... ...when it presents so feeble a defence! Always, at first, our modesty resists ...in these moments... ...the tender feelings you inspire us with. Whatever cause we find to justify the love that masters us... ...we still must feel some little shame in owning it. We defend ourselves first, but from the way we do it... ...we let a lover know our heart surrenders... The while our lips, for honour's sake, oppose... ...our heart's desire, and in refusing promise. There is no doubt I'm making you... ...an avowal all too freely... ...and with too little heed to modesty. But... now that I've made bold to speak... pray tell me. Should I have tried to keep Damis from speaking? Should I have heard the offer of your heart so quietly? Suffered all your pleading... ...and taken it just as I did... ...if such a declaration had not pleased me? And, when I tried my utmost to persuade you... ...not to accept the marriage that was talked of... ...what should my earnestness have hinted to you... ...if not the interest that you've inspired... ...and my chagrin, should such a match compel me... ...to share a heart I want all to myself? 'Tis, past a doubt, the height of pleasure... ...to hear such words from the lips one loves. Their honey pours profusely through my senses... ...a sweetness never tasted ere now. My heart employs its utmost zeal to please you... ...and counts your love its one beatitude. And yet that heart must beg that you allow it... ...to doubt a little, its felicity. I might well think these words an honest trick... ...to make me break off this approaching marriage. And if I may express myself quite plainly... ...I cannot trust these too enchanting words... ...until the grant of some little favour that I sigh for... ...shall assure me of the truth of what's been said... ...and plant within my soul a lasting faith... ...in the sweet charity... ...that you have for me. What? Must you move with such speed as that? Exhaust my heart's tenderness, all at once? She violates herself to confess her love... But that's still not enough for you... You are not yet satisfied, and will not be... ...without the granting of her utmost favours? The less a blessing is deserved, the less we dare to hope for it. And words alone can ill assuage our love's desires. One easily suspects a destiny full of glory... We must enjoy it ere we can believe it. And I, who know how little I deserve your goodness... ...doubt the fortunes of my daring. So I shall trust to nothing, madam, till... ...you convince my ardent flame with something real. Good Lord! How your love enacts the tyrant's role... ...and throws my mind into a strange confusion! With what fierce sway it rules a conquered heart... ...and violently will have its wishes granted! What...? Is there no escape from your pursuit? You don't give even time to take a breath? Nay, is it decent to be so exacting... ...to want at once the things you demand... ...and so abuse by urgency... ...the weakness you may discover in a woman's heart? But if my worship wins your gracious favour... ...then why refuse me some sure proof thereof? But how can I consent to what you wish... ...and not offend the Heaven you talk so much of? If Heaven is all that stands now in my way... ...I'll easily remove that little hindrance. Your heart need not hold back for such a trifle. But we're affrighted so by Heaven's commands! I can dispel these foolish fears, Madame. I know well the art of lifting scruples. Heaven forbids, 'tis true, some satisfactions... But we find means to make amends with Him. There is a science, that instructs us... ...how to enlarge the limits of our conscience... ...and rectify the evil of the deed... ...according to the purity of our intent. I'll duly teach you all these secrets, madam. You only need to let yourself be guided. Fulfill my wishes, and have no fear at all... I'll answer for it... ...and take the sin... ...upon myself. You cough a lot, Madame. Yes, it tortures me. Would you like a morsel of this liquorice? It is an obstinate cough... ...and all the licorice in the world will do no good. 'Tis very trying. Yes, more than words can say. In any case... ...your scruple is easily removed. With me you're sure of total secrecy. There's no harm unless a thing is known. The public scandal is what brings offence... ...and secret sinning is no sin at all. So then... ...I see I must resolve to yield. I must consent to grant you everything... ...and cannot hope to give full satisfaction... ...or win full confidence, at lesser cost. Without a doubt... ...'tis very hard to come to this... ...'tis quite against my will that I go so far. But since I must be forced to it... ...since nothing that can be said, suffices for belief... ...and since more convincing proof is still demanded... ...I must make up my mind to satisfy people. If my consent gives reason for offence... ...so much the worse for him who forced me to it. The fault can surely not be counted mine. Yes, Madame, I accept all blame. And the thing itself... Open the door... ...and see, I pray you... ...that my husband's not there in the hall. Why take such care for him? Between ourselves, he’s a man to be led by the nose. He takes pride in all our meetings... I've brought him to the state of seeing all and believing nothing. Never mind that... ...go out, I beg you, look about, and carefully examine every corner. That is, I confess... ...an abominable fellow! I can't get over it. The whole thing stuns me. What! You come out so soon? You cannot mean it! Get back under the table... 'tis not time yet. Wait until the end, to see, and make quite certain... ...and don't believe a thing on mere conjecture. No, nothing more wicked e'er came out of Hell. Dear me! Don't go and credit things too lightly. No, let yourself be quite convinced. Don't yield too soon, for fear you'll be mistaken. All things conspire, Madame, toward my satisfaction. I've searched the whole apartment through. There's no one here. And now my ravished soul… Stay! You are too eager in your amours... You needn't be so passionate. Ah ha! My holy man! You want to get over me! How abandoned is your soul to temptation! So you were going to marry my daughter, while you coveted my wife?! I doubted long enough if this was earnest... ...expecting all the time the tone would change. But now the proof's been carried far enough. I'm satisfied, and ask no more, for my part. 'Twas quite against my character to play this part. But I had no choice, but to treat you so. What? You believe…? Come, no protestations. Get out from here, and make no fuss about it. But my intent… These speeches are unseasonable. You must leave my house this instant. You're the one to leave it, you who play the master here! This house belongs to me, I'll have you know. I'll show you plainly it's no use... ...to turn to these low tricks, to pick a quarrel with me... ...and that you can't insult me at your pleasure... For I have wherewith to confound your lies... ...to avenge offended Heaven... ...and to compel those who talk to me of leaving, to repent. What sort of speech is this? What can it mean? My faith, I'm dazed. This is no laughing matter. How so? From his words, I see my great mistake. The deed of gift is what troubles my mind. "The deed of gift" …? Yes, it's a fait accompli. But I've another thing to make me anxious. What's that? You shall know all. Let's see at once... ...if a certain box is still upstairs. Whither away so fast? Alas, I cannot tell. Methinks... ...we should begin by taking counsel, to see what can be done... ...to meet the case. I'm all worked up about that wretched box. More than all else, it drives me to despair. That box must hide some mighty mystery. It was left with me by Argas... ...that friend I pitied. It was left in the greatest of secrecy. He chose me, in his exile, for this trust. And on these documents, from what he said... ...I judge his life and property depend. How could you trust them to another's hands? By reason of a conscientious scruple. I went straight to my traitor, to confide in him. His sophistry made me believe that I must give him the box to keep... ...so that, in case of search, I might deny my having it at all. ...and still, by favour of this evasion... ...my conscience clear... ...even in taking oath against the truth. Your case is bad... ...so far as I can see. The deed of gift, the confidence... ...were both, in my frank opinion... steps that you took too lightly. He can lead you to any length, with these as hostage. And since he holds you at such disadvantage... ...you'd be still more imprudent, to provoke him. You must go about it some more gentle way. What?! Beneath the semblance of such touching fervour... ...to hide a heart so false... ...a soul so base! And I who took him in as a penniless beggar! 'Tis too much! No more pious folk for me! I shall abhor them utterly forever more... ...and henceforth treat them worse than any devil. There you go again, quite off the handle! In nothing do you keep an even temper. It's always from one extreme to the other. You see your error, and you recognise... ...that you've been cozened by feigned zeal;. But to make up for't, in the name of reason... ...why would you plunge into a worse mistake... ...and find no difference between a worthless scamp... and all good people? What? Just because a rascal boldly duped you... ...with pompous show of false austerity... ...must you have that all are just like him... ...and no one's truly pious nowadays? Leave such conclusions to mere infidels... Distinguish virtue from its counterfeit. Don't give esteem too quickly, at a venture... ...but try to keep, in this, the golden mean. If you can help it, don't uphold imposture... But do not rail at true devoutness, either. And if you must fall into one extreme... ...then rather err again the other way. What? Father...! Is it true a scoundrel threatens you... ...forgets the many benefits received... ...and in his base abominable pride... ...makes of your very favours, arms against you? Too true, my son. It tortures me to think on't. Leave it to me... I'll chop his ears off for him. We must deal roundly with his insolence. 'Tis I must free you from him at a blow... ...and to set things right, must strike him down. Spoken like a true young man. But moderate your towering tantrums, will you? We live with such a king, in such an age... ...that violence can not advance our cause. What's all this? I hear there's been strange revelations here. Strange things indeed, for my own eyes to witness. You see how I'm rewarded for my kindness. I zealously receive a wretched beggar... I lodge him, entertain him like my brother... ...and load him with benefactions every day. I give him my daughter, I give him all my fortune... and he meanwhile, the villain, rascal, wretch... ...tries with black arts to seduce my wife. And not content with such a foul design... ...he dares to menace me with my own favours... ...and would make use of those advantages... ...which my too foolish kindness armed him with... ...to ruin me, to take my fortune from me... ...and leave me in the state from which I saved him. Oh, the poor man! My son, I cannot possibly believe... ...that he could intend so black a deed. What? Worthy men are oft the sport of envy. Mother, what do you mean by such a speech? There are strange goings-on about your house... ...and everybody knows your people hate him. What has that hate to do with what you are told? I always said, my son, when you were little... Virtue in the world is hated ever... The envious may die, but envy never What's that fine speech to do with present facts? Be sure, they've trumped up a hundred idle tales about him… I've told you once, I saw it all myself! The malice of scandal-mongers knows no end. Mother, you'd have me damn my soul. I tell you I saw his shamelessness with my own eyes. Their tongues for spitting venom never lack... There's nothing here on Earth they'll not attack. Your speech has not a single grain of sense. I saw it, harkee, saw it, with these eyes I SAW! Know what SAW means? Must I say it 100 hundred times, and drum it into your ears? Goodness, appearances are oft deceiving... ...and seeing shouldn't always be believing. I'll go mad! False suspicions may delude... ...and good to evil, is misconstrued. Must I construe as Christian charity... ...the wish to kiss my wife? You must, at least, have just cause for accusing people... ...and wait until you see a thing for sure. The devil! How could I see any surer? Should I have waited till, before my eyes... You'll make me say things quite improper. After all, 'tis known too pure a zeal inflames him. And so, I cannot possibly conceive... ...that he should try to do what's charged against him. I cannot say... ...what I might say if you were not my mother... I'm so enraged about it! Fortune has paid you fair, to be so doubted... You flouted our report, now yours is flouted. We're wasting time here in the merest trifling... ...which we should rather use in taking measures... ...to guard ourselves against the scoundrel's threats. You think his effrontery could go far? I for one, can't believe it possible. Why, his ingratitude would be too flagrant. Don't trust to that... He'll be cunning enough to give the colour of reason to his acts... And for less cause than this, a strong scheme... ...can make ones life a nightmare of troubles. I tell you once again... armed as he is... ...you never should have pushed him quite so far. True, yet what could I do? The villain's pride made me lose all control of my resentment. I wish with all my heart... ...that some pretence of peace could be fixed between you two. If I had known what weapons he was armed with... ...I never would have raised such an alarm. What does this fellow want? Go quick, find out. I'm in a fine state to receive a visitor! Good day, good sister. Pray you, let me see the master of the house. He has company. I doubt if he can see anyone at present. I'm not here intending to make trouble. My coming can, I think, nowise displease him. My errand he will find to his advantage. Your name? Tell him I come on behalf of Mr Tartuffe... for his good. It is a man who comes, with civil manners... ...sent by Mr Tartuffe, he says, upon an errand... ...that you'll be well pleased with. Surely you must see him. Find out who he is, and what he wants. Perhaps he's come to make it up between us. In what manner shall I treat him? Your resentment can't break out. And if he talks of an arrangement, listen to him. Greetings, Sir. May Heaven send harm to your foes... ...and as good favour to you as I could wish for! This kindly opening suits with my conjectures... ...and promises some compromise already. All of your family has long been dear to me. I had the honour, sir, to serve your father. Sir, I am much ashamed, and ask your pardon... ...for not recalling now your face or name. My name is Loyal. A Norman by birth... My office is court-bailiff, in spite of envy. For 40 years, by the grace of God... ...it's been my fortune to perform that office with honour. So I've come, Sir, by your leave... ...to render service of a certain writ. What... - You are here to…? - Pray, sir, don't be angry. 'Tis nothing, Sir, just a little summons... ...an order to you and yours to vacate this house. To move out your furniture, make room for others... ...and that without delay or deferral, as needs must be. I? Leave this house? Yes, Sir... If you please. The house is now, as you well know, of course... ...Mr Tartuffe's, beyond all dispute, Of all your goods, he is henceforth lord and master... ...by virtue of a contract here attached. It is drawn in due form, and unassailable. Your insolence is monstrous, and astounding! I have no business, Sir, that touches you. This is the gentleman. He's fair and courteous, and knows too well a gentleman's behaviour... ...to dare in any way to question justice. But... Sir, I know that not for a million... ...would you be tempted to rebel... ...and as an honest person, you will allow me... ...to execute the court orders I've received. Your long black gown may well, before you know it... ...get a thorough beating, Mr Court-bailiff. Sir, make your son be silent or have him leave. I should be loath to have to set things down... ...and see your names inscribed in my report. This Mr Loyal's looks are most disloyal. I have much feeling for respectable and honest folk like you, sir... ...and consented to serve these papers... ...only to oblige you, and make you happy. And thus prevent the choice of any other... ...who, with less regard for you than I possess... ...may have proceeded in a somewhat rougher manner. And how could one do worse, than order people from their house? Why, we allow you time... ...and will even suspend until tomorrow... ...the execution of this order, Sir. I'll just come here and spend the night... ...with 10 of my men, without scandal, or noise. And just for form's sake, please, before retiring... ...you'll need to bring me the keys to your door. I will take care not to disturb your rest... ...and ensure there's no unseemly conduct. But by to-morrow, at early morning, you must make haste... ...to clear the house, down to the least utensil. My men will help you... I have chosen strong ones... ...to serve you, Sir, in clearing out the house. No one could act more generously, I fancy, And, since I'm treating you with great indulgence... ...I beg you'll do as well by me, Sir... ...and see I'm not disturbed in my discharge of duty. I'd give this very minute, and not grudge it... ...the hundred best gold louis I have left... ...if I could just indulge myself, and land my fist... ...for one mighty blow, upon his snout. Enough! Don't make things worse. His insolence is too great. I can scarcely restrain myself. By my faith, with such a broad back, good Mr Loyal... ...some cudgel blows would suit you well. My girl, such infamous words are actionable. ...and warrants can be issued against women, too. Enough of this discussion, Sir. Have done. Give us the document, then leave us, pray. Till we meet again. Heaven bless you all together! And may it damn YOU... ...and the one who sent you! Well, Mother, whether I'm right not... ...this writ may help you now to judge the matter. Or don't you see his treachery even yet? I feel stunned... ...as if fallen from the clouds! You complain without reason. You've no right to blame him. This action only proves his good intentions. Love for his neighbour makes his virtue perfect. He knows how corrupting money can be... ...and through charity he wants to relieve you... ...of all that puts an obstacle to your salvation. Be quiet! Must I always have to say that to you? Come, let us discuss what course you have to follow. Go and expose his audacious ingratitude. Such action surely invalidates the deed of gift. His perfidy must now appear too black.. ...to bring him the success that he expects. 'Tis with regret, Sir, that I bring bad news. But urgent danger forces me to do so. A close and intimate friend of mine... ...who knows the interest I take in what concerns you... ...has broken, in a most delicate action... ...the secrecy that's due to state affairs... ...and sent me word, just now... ...which gives you no choice but sudden flight. The villain who so long imposed upon you... ...an hour ago saw the prince, to accuse you... ...and put in his hands, among other things... ...the private strong-box of a state-criminal... ...that you, failing in your duty as a subject... ...have kept its guilty secret. I know no more of it, save that a warrant's drawn against you, Sir. For security, Mr Tartuffe will come with the officers who arrest you. So he has armed support. This is how the scoundrel seeks to secure the property he claims. One has to admit... ...man is a wicked animal. The least delay may be fatal for you, Sir. I have my carriage at the door for you... ...and a thousand louis, provided for your journey. Let's lose no time... the bolt is poised to strike. Only flight can save you from it now. I'll be your guide to seek a place of safety... ...and stay with you until you reach it, Sir. Alas! How much I owe to your obliging care! Another time must serve to thank you aptly. And I pray Heaven... ...to grant me so much favour... ...that I may some day recompense your service. Good-bye. You all take care... Come, hurry! We'll see to everything that's needful, brother. Softly, sir, softly... do not run so fast. You haven't far to go to find your lodging... By order of the prince, we take you prisoner. Villain! You kept this blow for the last. This is the stroke to be rid of me... ...and is the crown of all your perfidies. I shall not be embittered by your insults... ...for Heaven has taught me to endure all things. His moderation, I must own, is great. How shamelessly the wretch makes bold with Heaven! All your ravings cannot move me... All my thought is but to do my duty. You must claim great glory from this honourable act... ...and your employment is most honourable. An act cannot be aught but honourable... ...coming from that high power who sends me here. Ungrateful wretch, do you forget 'twas I... ...that rescued you from utter misery? Yes... I've not forgot some help received. But the interests of the prince are my first duty. The power of this sacred duty... ...stifles in my heart all gratitude... ...and to such powerful a tie I'd sacrifice... friend... wife... kindred... ...and myself, with them. You hypocrite! How well he knows the villainous trick... ...of cloaking himself with what we most revere! If it is as perfect as you say,... ...this zeal that urges you, and you cloak yourself in... why should it wait to show itself... ...until the day he caught you soliciting his wife? Why have you not thought to go inform against him... ...until his honour forces him to drive you out of his house? I don't suggest you should have been drawn from your duty... ...by his making all his property over to you. Still, if you meant to treat him now as guilty... ...how could you then consent to take his gift? Pray, sir, deliver me from all this squawking... ...and be good enough to carry out your order. Yes, I've too long delayed its execution. 'Tis very fitting you should urge me to it. So therefore, you must follow me at once... ...to prison, where you'll find your lodging ready. Who? Me, sir? Yes, you. By why to prison? You are not the one to whom I owe account. You Sir, compose yourself, after so great an alarm. Our prince is not a friend to double dealing. His eyes can read men's inmost hearts... ...and all the wiles of hypocrites cannot deceive him. His great mind has fine discernment... ...and he always sees things clear and true. His mind cannot too easily be swayed... ...for reason always holds the balance even. He honours and exalts true piety. But he dispenses favours with open eyes... ...and his love for the true does not close his heart... ...to the disgust with which the false inspires. This fellow was by no means apt to fool him... ...for he could well avoid his subtle snares. And his quick insight pierced immediately... ...the hidden baseness of this tortuous heart. Accusing you, the knave betrayed himself... ...and by true recompense of Heaven's justice... ...he stood revealed before our monarch's eyes... ...a scoundrel known before by other names... ...whose horrid crimes, detailed at length... ...might fill a long-drawn history of many volumes. This monarch, in a word... ...hated his cowardly ingratitude and disloyalty towards you... ...and has added these horrors to his other crimes... ...and sent me here under his direction to see his insolence surpass itself... ...and force him then to give you satisfaction. Your papers, which the traitor says are his... I am to take from him, and give you back. The deed of gift transferring your estate ...our monarch's sovereign-will, makes null and void. And he pardons you... ...for the secret personal offence your friend involved you in. Thus he rewards your recent zeal... ...displayed in helping to maintain his rights... ...to show how well his heart, when least expected... ...knows how to recompense a noble deed... ...and will not let true merit miss its due... ...remembering always rather good than evil. May Heaven be praised! - At last I breathe again. - A happy outcome! Who'd have dared to hope it? Well then... There you are... ...villain! Brother, hold! Don't descend to such indignities, I beg you. Leave the poor wretch to his unhappy fate... ...and let remorse, not you, oppress him. Hope, rather, that his heart may now return to virtue... ...and that he reforms his ways and hates his vice... ...and may appease the justice of our glorious prince. While you must straightway go, and on your knees... ...repay with thanks his noble generous kindness. Yes, well said! We'll go, and at his feet kneel down, with joy... ...to thank him for his goodness shown. And this first duty done, with honours due... ...we'll then attend upon another, too... ...with wedded happiness, reward Valere... ...and crown a lover, noble and sincere.
