People came to see us that Christmas. They were nice, those people. They brought me things: a wooden train, some candy, a book of bible stories from Reverend Watkins. But there was no snow. No, not that year. David! Honey! Aw! Then that spring, Aunt Mae came to live with us. Next to the train, I remember Aunt Mae most. I don't remember any children of my own age comin' 'round that Christmas. As a matter of fact, I don't remember seeing any other children at all. - Night-night. - Thanks again. Mae! Had no right to dress that way, You deliberately hurt me... and all of Frank's friends. If I knew you were gonna act this way... I would've never let you come live with us. But, Sarah, honey, I didn't know they were gonna take on like that. I mean, I've worn this gown... in front of audiences from Charleston to New Orleans. I forgot to show you my clippin's, didn't I? Just look at those notices. Those notices are superb, particularly about this gown. Let's go. Look, Aunt Mae, on the stage that gown may have been quite successful, But you don't know what it's like to live in a small town like this. And if Frank heard about things like this, he wouldn't let you stay here. So don't ever do that to me again. "Mae Morgan, popular singer at the Rivoli theatre." You know, David, once, a duke kissed my hand and he asked me to marry him and live with him in Europe. Then he drank wine right out of my slipper. He must have been drunk? What he know about a duke, anyway? Yeah. Memphis. Biloxi. Honey, I've played 'em all. Believe me. I don't want her here! Frank, she's got no place else to go! You better run on in, honey, before Poppa blows my brains out. Good night, Aunt Mae. Good night, honey. Hey, now! Shit! David, honey, will you bring me the shampoo bottle from the closet? That little green one? Mae. This is little David. Hello, little David. Why... ...George! Do you think they'll get serious? Not if he has to drink wine out of her slipper. He'll never live long enough to marry her. Frank. Nah, I think it'll be good for her. Come on, "Franchot". Okay, Aunt Mae. "Miss Jean Harlow", if you please! She was my only playmate. And mother was glad we were such good friends. Georgie. George! Georgie! Come on out here with us tonight. Well, I think we will. Well, I'm glad I've got your-- You mean those little holes there? George! He carried on with Aunt Mae all through that summer and into part of the fall. Then... one day... George didn't come around any more. It's your turn, Aunt Mae. I'm sorry, honey. You bastard, George. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! -You've been crying. -No, I haven't! Can you fight? Can you jump? No. -Can't you do anything? -No! Aw, you're just a sissy! You shouldn't have taken him, Frank! He's gotta play with other kids! Staying with her ain't healthy. It ain't healthy! You louse! Bruce's mom made me stay on the porch till Poppa came! All right, David. All right. Never you mind, honey, just never mind. I'll sleep with you tonight, David. Would you like that? I couldn't sleep with Frank, not tonight. There. Hey, just like Franchot Tone. Frank... Come on in, Frank. Yeah! Light it up! Come on, burn that nigger! Burn him! I ain't goin' in there, it's hotter than hell! Poppa! Mother, Poppa's here! Good, does he have the money? Frank... -What's that? -Seeds, Sarah. Seeds! Seeds? What are they for? I'm gonna grow things... on the hill. Well, that's crazy! Nothing'll grow there. Anyway, what'd you buy them with? The money from the gas station. -All of it? -All of it. You take those seeds back tonight, Frank! You get that money back, tonight! There is no food! We gotta eat! You've got a son to feed! There's plenty of money to be made up in them hills, plenty money! We got no money! Well, dammit, I can spend my own money, like I want! You want money? You want some money? Then, go down to barroom and sell some of Mae's jewelry! Plenty of women down there like that cheap kind of stuff! You call Aunt Mae what you want to! I know what you think of her! We've got a son to feed! We gotta eat! We need money! Aunt Mae! Aunt Mae! I'm gonna plant those seeds, you hear me? I'm gonna plant 'em! She gonna die, Aunt Mae? No, honey. No, she just lost a tooth... and her dignity, that's all. Where's Poppa? I'll go find him. How is she? She'll be all right, David. But what about Poppa, Aunt Mae? Don't worry 'bout him. No place else for him to go. He'll show up. Tell me about the stage, Aunt Mae. Tell me about Biloxi. Honey, I felt lucky if I got a job in some little dance hall from Mobile or Baton Rouge. But I just love the stage, David. I just love the spotlight, the costumes, feeling the beat of the band underneath me. I never sang good, honey, I knew that. But when I was... younger... I looked good in clothes... and I could always carry a tune. But you get... older, honey. You get old. But you keep on goin'. You keep on thinkin', "One day they'll see me... I'll cut a record." One day they'll say, "Hey, there goes Mae Morgan." It's just like a drug is what it is, hon. And when it doesn't happen... ...you hurtin'. You hurt right in there. Then some guy thinks you're awful nice. Yeah, so does the next guy, and next, and next... till you get to be just kind of a used up piece of... goods. You know? No honest man wants anything to do with me. And at that last job... It was just the crummiest. You know, someone threw a bottle at me? "Watch out, Mae!" and then wham! You imagine that? Well, the girls... the dancers, you know they-- they all got together, they bought me my ticket down here. Down here... just a big old sore thumb. You know that, David. I just went on the stage to show off, 'cause nobody ever paid any attention to me otherwise. It does hurt, though. I just want to be happy... with you all here. Honey... We all have our hurts don't we? Big and small. Don't pay me no mind. Your old Aunt Mae just ain't feeling too good tonight. Come sleep with me, honey, will you? I'm feeling kind of lonesome tonight. Do you ever pray before you go to sleep, David? Sometimes. Well, we'll pray tonight. We'll pray that your mother feels well tomorrow... that nothin' happens to your Poppa... and that you and I won't hurt too bad tomorrow... or ever again. Amen. It has been wonderful to be in this town with Bobbie Lee, my friends. God bless all of you. May the heavens shine down upon you, Christian and sinner alike. You are all our brothers and sisters in Christ. By now there is no need for me to introduce Bobbie Lee to y'all. You have come to love him. Good crowd. Good money. Everybody loves a dedicated Christian. Sinners fear one. You have shown that you love this chosen man. Here is your Bobbie Lee. Here we are gathered together again for another glorious night of conversion and salvation. I was prayin' right before I came up here... that the testimonies would be many. I was prayin' that more lost souls would give themselves up to the glory of Jesus Christ. I feel in my soul that these prayers will be answered, that sinners will surrender to Him by the hundredfold. He don't care who you are. He don't care if you are rich or if you are poor. Amen! He don't care if you're a little baby... or a grandfather. Amen. All he cares about... is if you got a soul to give him. Amen! That's what Jesus cares about! Amen! That is all. What more could he want? Amen. He don't want earthly riches. They lead to lust! They lead to sin! Praise God! Tell it, Bobbie Lee! He owns the universe! Amen! He wants for nothin'... except... your souls. Amen! I feel Jesus in this tent. I feel him today! Do you feel him? Do you feel Jesus? Raise your arms to heaven! Do you feel Jesus? Do you feel Jesus? If you feel him, raise your arms to Jesus! Praise the Lord! Today our nation is havin' a mortal struggle with the devil. In our cities, our girls are giving themselves up to the oldest profession. They go where they want. To dances and honky-tonk at army bases without a restraining hand. The devil is tempting these women, drawing them into his web! When they're dancing, do you think they're thinking about Jesus? You can bet your life they're not! Jesus has no place on the dance floor! No, sir, that is the playground of the devil! Amen! Now... are you fightin' with the devil? Are you falling under his influence? How many other of you women are stifling tears of repentance? - Sweet Lord Jesus! - Don't be afraid! Let Jesus know you're sorry. Cry to Him for mercy! I'm Mrs. Ollie Wingate, and for a long time, for a long time, I felt like I needed the help of Jesus! Amen! - Most of y'all know who I am. - Praise the Lord! I-- I own the grocery on Main. Amen! But-- but I am resigned to the Lord. I wanna repent... and be converted to His way! Weren't those words of inspiration? - There they are! - Praise the Lord! They wanna dedicate their lives to Jesus! What a wonderful turn their lives have taken tonight! Let's hear from this boy! My name is Billy Sunday Thompson, and... I'd like to dedicate myself to Jesus! Those are the words of a babe! - Amen! - Testify! Testify! Come to Jesus! Finally come to Jesus! Open up your hearts! Let the light come pouring in! Walk with Him into the Garden of Eden! And feel the strength of Jesus comin' into your souls! Yesterday... December 7th, 1941-- a date which will live... in infamy-- the United States of America... was suddenly and deliberately attacked... by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. Last night, Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong. Last night, Japanese forces attacked Guam. Last night, Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands. Last night, the Japanese attacked Wake Island. And this morning, the Japanese attacked Midway Island. And our interests are in grave danger. With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, We will gain the inevitable triumph-- So help us God. Woo! -Look at those two go! -Swing her Aunt Mae! You've seen how Miss Morgan can dance. Well, she can sing too! Flora, I haven't sung in a hundred years. So, she's gonna sing for us right now, Miss Mae Morgan! Woo! -You guys know "My Romance"? -Sure. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I'll tell you one thing: It ain't gonna be "God Bless America." Okay, let's do it. Thank you, thank you. Thanks! -You're good. -Well, I used to sing. We should talk. Thank you. You were so funny with Flora. You know, I never thought I'd be happy here. The sun isn't prettier anywhere else than it is here in Italy. It's the brightest and yellowest I ever saw. I'm staying in a farmhouse a thousand years old. They've got olives, too. There's been some pretty heavy fighting. I marched along the Appian Way. That's a very famous road in history, so, tell your teacher. And, I saw where the pope lives, too. I miss every one of you, more than I ever thought I would. But most of the fighting's over now. Frank. Frank. No. No. Then the war was over. And all the soldiers came home. I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible... I thank the Lord that I have this struggle coming up. I wouldn't want it any other way. I think... I think I can appreciate the other man's position. But I think I can do more for my fellow man, having experienced the Christian power of God's love. His love is not like human love. His love is straight... and true. For all God-fearing people... ...know His way. And live... ...by His will. If you were different from anybody in town, you had to get out. That's why everybody was so much alike. They used to tell us in school to think for yourselves, but you couldn't do that in town. You had to think what your father thought all his life, and that was the way everybody thought. They're the ones! Them and those damn politicians! Don't go to the Union meeting, Frank. You can't lose this job, too. Sarah, we're fighting for our lives. I'm fightin' for you. They're the people that are keeping us poor. Those damn rich bastards! David, just look! Big cabbages! Big, big cabbages your Poppa grew. Say it again, David. It's so beautiful. "Read from some humbler poet, "Whose songs gushed from his heart, "As showers from the clouds of summer, Or tears from the eyelids started;" "Who, through long days of labor, "And nights devoid of ease, "Still heard in his soul the music Of wonderful melodies." "Then read from the treasured volume "The poem of thy choice, "And lend to the rhyme of the poet The beauty of thy voice." "And the night shall be filled with music "And the cares that infest the day, "Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs, And as silently steal away." You goin' to high school, boy? No, I got a job in Mr. Williams' drugstore. Well... you're the first person in our family to finish grade school, anyway. I'm real proud of you. Why, Aunt Mae, it's a watch! That must have cost at least 30 dollars. Much, much more. You can ride up here with us if you want, David. No, Mae, there ain't enough room for him up here. I bet he'd rather ride in the back than up here with us. Look, honey, go wait there by the path for me. I'm gonna stay here with Clyde a little while. Now, don't you go off, you hear! I don't wanna go up that path alone. I won't be long! Clyde, what are you doin'? Cut it out! Clyde! You sing so bad, I can tell! Yeah. Good night, Clyde! Where's Flora, Sarah? Sarah, where's Flora? Flora? Yes. She told me I was crazy, Mae. I mean, right to my face. She wasn't here... 30 minutes. And I've been sitting here... waiting... ...for you two to come home. Yes, Flora wasn't here... ...thirty minutes. Maybe it's this one. It could be this grave, Mae. Mae! Hey Mae! I'm comin', Clyde honey! Look, David, honey, I gotta go. We're playing a wedding at the county seat. It's real good money. Get out! Now,Gangbusters , presented in cooperation with police and federal law enforcement departments throughout the United States... The only national program that brings you authentic police case histories. Tonight, Gangbusters presents "The Case of the Appointment with Death." But a courageous police woman waited for a deadly killer, whom police didn't even know. Gangbusters has asked the honorable Frederick H. Block, Assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, to narrate tonight's case. Thank you, and good evening. What are they doin', Aunt Mae? They're burning books, David. They're burning Gone With the Wind. The sly and the tricky in this community, want you to read these licentious books. These dirty books! All the dirtier, 'cause they're gonna make movies out of 'em. And anyone who doesn't know it is defying God and is an agent of the devil! David, it's just so wonderful! It just... You can just feel the light goin' through you. Just go through your whole body, David. Soldiers comin' home married to foreign women. We should be lookin' out and seein' the good, American blood in the valley won't lose its purity. Chinese women, pregnant women, women who sing with bands, are corrupting America's sons. How can you listen to that trash, Sarah? How? Who do you think the murderer is, David? Who? Reverend Watkins... is a good Christian man. Yeah. Do you have this month's Modern Romance? I asked if you had this month's Modern Romance. Yes, I know. I don't know if we have it, but I'll look. Thanks. Do you work here all the time? Yes, I do. All the time's the store's open and from 30 minutes before it does. How old are you? 'Bout... ...19? And a half. You're from out of the valley, aren't you? Yes. We came here to take care of my grandpa. He got sick. If he gets better, we're gonna go home again. Springhill. -That's where you're from? -Yeah. You ever been there? No, I've never been out of the valley. Well, if you ever do get out, don't go there. This place is prettier. I forgot to tell you... good-bye. good-bye. 19... And a half. Aunt Mae, I saw a girl in the store I really liked. Why didn't you ask her out, Dave? Suppose she won't go out with me? Don't worry, Dave, she will. You're a nice lookin' boy. Ask her! Dishpan hands and a date with a Girl Scout. - Good night, darling. - Good night, Mother. Happy dreams. Good night, Mr. Beragon. Thank you for everything. I trust that we may meet again very soon. I hope so. Thank you for a divine evening, Mrs. Pierce. I trust that I might see you again in the not too distant future. Good night. - Come on, small fry. - I'm coming. Come on, never mind. Hurry up! For heaven's sake! Leave something on me. I might catch cold. I was just thinking. Not about you. Come on! That's a very cute youngster of yours. Yes, isn't she? I thought you had two? Personally, Veda's convinced me that alligators have the right idea. They eat their young. Let's go for a walk. Let's go up and see those houses that they're buildin', David. I thought your grandfather wanted you home? We won't be there long. I just wanna see. I liked the movie. So did I. Where are they? Where's the old guy keep 'em? Under the counter? Are they under the counter? What? You know... Them! God, you're dumb! Rubbers! I don't know. Geez, he's so dumb! Dumb! We goin' outside, baby... Outside. I've brought your medicine from the drugstore, Miss Scover. Come in, boy... while I get the money. Yeah. There you go, baby. Lie down there, baby. Yeah. How old are you boy? 15. Do you deliver at night? Tuesdays and Thursdays. Next time... ...come back Thursday. Come in, boy... while I get my purse. No... ...I can't. Just for a little while. It's damp out here. No. Aunt Mae... How do I look? You'll be a fine lookin' boy in about a year or so. Your body's gettin' some lines. Your face is gettin' to look like a man's, too. Sarah! Come and eat! Sarah? Go eat! How was work today? Just slow, but okay, I guess. - What's the matter? - Nothin'. David, I have something to tell you. I got a letter from Clyde today. Here... Wanna read it? Well... Clyde says he thinks he can get us a good job... a permanent one... in Nashville. On radio and records. What do you think of that, hon? I don't know, Aunt Mae. What does it mean? What about me and mother? But that's just it, hon. If I get a job, I can send for you both. Clyde says... he says we can make a lot of money. But what am I gonna do with mother? I work all day, I can't leave her here alone! Honey, she's no trouble. Look... ...quit your job. If I quit my job, I'll lose about the best I could get anywhere. No, you quit your job at the store. And then you'll have time to stay home with mother all day. And in a week, no more than two... you'll get those tickets to Nashville from me. Honey... there's nothing to worry about, really. David, this is such a big chance for me. I can sing on the radio and records. I'll be making so much money that you can quit your job and join me. I'm taking a bus out of here day after tomorrow. Don't worry. It won't be long before you and mother get a train ticket from me, you hear? Now, you tell Mr. Williams tomorrow, you wanna quit. There... You see how they're growin'? From the tiny little seeds your Poppa planted. They're growing up all over. But I saw them in the clearing first. I saw them first. Everything was changing. Mother, Aunt Mae, and then Jo Lynne left. What's the matter with you? We only went out once! -Wait, Jo Lynne. -Let me go! Jo Lynne, we can get married. The state'll marry us. Let me go! You're crazy, like your mother! Well, good night, David. I have to quit, Mr. Williams. Are you makin' fun, David? No, Mr. Williams, I really mean it. I have to leave because Aunt Mae is going to Nashville tomorrow, and there's no one to look after mother but me. You need to earn money, David. You can't do it alone. She could get help. Reverend Watkins could help. No one is gonna take my mother to the crazy house! Or the poor folks asylum! I won't let anyone touch her! All right, David. All right. Thank you, Mr. Williams. It's the cold breeze, hon. Always makes my eyes water. Mother? Ten, eleven, twelve. Mother? Mother. Frank. Hello, son. My name's David. What do you want? I'm here on behalf of the state, son. Now, you know your mother needs a better place to stay. You can't look after her by yourself. With your aunt here it was different. She isn't going with you. She isn't here. Now, son, you don't understand. I'll get her myself. She's not up there! I wanna see what's done is best for us all. You can't come in here like that! Get the hell out of this house, you bastard! I won't listen to any more of your profanity, boy. Get out! I didn't ask the conductor where this train went. I know I should. But I just gave him Mr. Williams' money and told him to let me off where it didn't pay for the ride anymore. Maybe they're up at the house now, too. But I'm not scared now, with the train getting this far away. Maybe I'll get a job. Maybe I'll save some money and go to Nashville to look for Aunt Mae. I guess they think that's where I am. I guess they think I went to look for her.
