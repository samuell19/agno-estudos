Hello! Excuse us. -Hey! -Hey, guys! Hey! All right, thank you. Quiet. (CHUCKLING Hi, I'm Doug. I'm Melissa. I was Chris' first wife... And I was his second. Chris made me promise not to get all... sappy and sentimental, but... If I may... I'm gonna do it anyway. Christopher Cavatelli... worked the most incredible magic in that... dingy condom store across the courtyard... which basically did everything but sell condoms. The lesbian poetry center, HIV support groups... -AA meetings. -Teens at risk, everything. He made a family for people who had lost it. And he had this ability to celebrate so completely who he was, that... in the circle of his confidence... he helped the rest of us be more fully who we really are. I'm so proud of him. I'll miss him. I love you, Chris. -We all love you. -We all love you. We love you, Chris! Anyway, that ends the sappy part of the evening. And now, let's get on with the... Party! Come on! Oh, my God. -What is he doing here? -Unbelievable. -Should we go and talk to him? -You talk to him. I'll lose it, and I don't want to make a scene. You, not make a scene? -Hey. -Hey. Hi. -It's good to see you. -Yeah... I'm sorry it had to be now. Me too. You look... really different. -Your hair and everything. -Yeah, thanks. Great dress! I thought this was supposed to be his wake. It is. It's what he wanted. The guy who gave the speech... -Is that Doug? -Yeah. Is that the guy who got my brother sick? No. He's fine. He's... And you? You okay? Yeah... I'm fine. You know what? You really should meet Doug. -Come on. -No, I don't think so. -They got a bathroom around here? -Yeah, it's out... But you know what? Can I get you a drink? -Want some? -Sure. Excuse me. You know, Doug. I don't think that bathroom thing was such a good idea. What are you talking about? It was the best idea I had all week. I'm so sorry. Well, thanks for coming. -My deepest condolences. -Oh God, please. Thanks for coming, you guys. Really. Bye. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. You want to be alone? No, I don't want to be alone. Is everybody gone? Yeah... It's almost morning. I'm worried about Gaetano. Yeah? Oh, you know how he is. The man's an alcoholic penis with legs. Gaetano, what's going on, man? Been hooking you up all night. -Where's the love? -Still haven't gotten lucky? It's because I haven't found anybody as good looking as you, Shane. -There you are. -Thank you. -How could you? -Jesus! She's doing you a favor. He's got the clap. -What are you doing? -You are a slut. So is she. That's what makes this beautiful. You missed the memorial. Those thing give me the creeps. Wait a minute! -Look what you guys did. -What are you doing? I'm trying to choke on my own vomit, you happy? Come on, Melissa. Let's dance. -You've had enough. -There's no such thing. Yeah, come on. -Time to go home. -I don't wanna go home. -Who's touching my ass? -Let's go home, okay? Excuse me, that's my property. What are those? What are those? A letter from Chris. It probably just got lost in the mail or in that mess of an apartment you live in. Whatever. -Don't start. -I'm horny. I'm a complete loser. No, you're not. I'm just gonna wake up in the morning and embrace the fact that I am a complete loser. -Loser, loser, loser... -Oh, stop! -Loser! -Stop, all right? It's ridiculous. I can't even finish writing my book, I get fired from a coffee house, and now, my dead, gay ex-husband doesn't even write. Are you guys hungry? -No, I could use some coffee. -You know what? Today is my birthday. -No... -Oh shit! Oh my God, no! I'm sorry. -Yes... -I totally forgot with the memorial and everything. -I'm so sorry. -My friends are even losers. Melissa, if you're a loser, but you know you're a loser, then you're not a total loser. -I called my mom... -Now you're a total loser. Oh yeah, she was nice for a little while, then she goes... "You know, when I was your age I had you, a husband I could keep, a house and a Buick." How do people do it? I'm having an existential crisis here. -Let's change the subject... -I think we're all set on this... Were there any cute guys at the memorial? -You're not gonna believe it. The brother showed up. -Yes. -The brother showed up. -Unbelievable. The fuck was there? Yes. -Yes. -Well at least we'll never have to see him again. -Should have given him a piece of my mind. -Yeah, I'd like to see that. What is that supposed to mean, that schmuck? You'd like to give him a piece of something else. Whoo! The plot thickens. I don't know... You live here? Right there. You're living in your car? Either that or lose my cell phone. -Why am I not surprised? -Goodnight. Good night... Sean Penn did it. -You're not Sean Penn. -You're not Sean Penn. Give me my lighter. Look... Do you wanna stay at my place tonight again? Look, you guys, it's a philosophical decision. You live in a shot glass with an intercom for 600 a month... and I get the beach for free. Goodnight! Lock your doors! What the... Francis! Oh my God! I'm sorry... I'm sorry, it's spooky. You look just like Chris. It's uncanny. Who are you? I'm Gabe. Your brother's lawyer. Oh. So, do you have his ashes? I got a cab waiting for me. Doug! Doug! I got it! I got it! I told you! You clean out your room once in awhile, you'll find things. Oh, hi! -Hi, Gabe... -Hi, how are you? -What are you doing here? -Hi, Doug. Wow, you got a letter too, huh? What do you mean, too? What are they doing here? Wait, wait... What the hell is going on here? I got this letter at my hotel that tells me I'm supposed to come to this place and pick up my brother's ashes and bring them back to his family. Now do you or do you not have my brother's ashes? Ashes? What about his ashes? Does yours mention anything about ashes? No, mine's the same as yours... -And Gaetano's. It just... -Who the hell is Gaetano? Well... Wait, what's going on here? Is this what's happening? -What the hell else... -Is he getting the ashes? -Yes, I'm getting the ashes... -Hi! -Other than to pick up... -I don't know why you'd come to this place! -Do you have my brother's... -He said it would be this way. -ashes or what? -Is he getting the ashes? You are not his family. Do you understand me? Hi guys... If Gabe is playing this, then my four favorite people are in the room. And now you're all wondering about the ashes. Well, be patient. And Frank... Please just trust me. I know this must sound crazy... Call it my dying wish, but I've registered you all for the West Coast Cycle for AIDS. It's 450 miles in six days to raise money to fight the thing that got me... You should all probably train. And Gaetano, no drugs or booze, okay? Do it for me guys... please? I love you. Hi, kids! -Hey! -Good morning! -Where'd you get all this stuff? -I thought you were broke. I sold it all. -For a bike? -No, not for a bike. A Softride, PowerWing, 650 aluminum... Monocoque racing bike. With the grey trim and Spinergy wheels. Is this awesome or what? He's high. I am not. I'm totally clean. As a matter of fact, I even quit smoking. What are you doing? -Excuse me. -Intervening. I learned it from my mother. What do you got in here? Altoids. Afraid I'm gonna overdose on breath mints? Well, hello! Very hello He looks good. He must have trained. -We trained. -Yeah, right. One fifteen mile ride... and we stopped for cream puffs and lattes. I did my homework. Oh, yeah right... You read 20 books on cycling. It took him three hours and two lesbians with a toolbox to get his bike together. Your attention please. -Hey - All riders please report to the start line. Your attention please. All riders please report to the start line. Come on, guys. You know, this isn't so bad after all. This is a piece of cake. Look at those cars. 25 miles down, 50 more to go. Cinch. -On the left! -On the left! That was Frank. Schmuck. You know, I think we over-trained. Yep. We can do this! Yeah? We just got out ass kicked by the golden girls. This hill... is a metaphor for my life. Oh, my God. What? Every failure I've ever had is flashing before my eyes. What are you doing? I'm having a panic attack. A feeling of no control. I can't do anything but worry. How is this different from your everyday life? It's more intense. Last time this happened... was when I got kicked out of film school. -What should I do? -Go away! Not that far. -Do soothing things. -Soothing? - Well, what shall I do? Burn incense and chant? I don't know, I don't know. Make shit up. -Say something soothing. -I really like your hair like that. It's a fucking mess! I'm gonna go home... I'm gonna go home. No! It's a hill. It's a goddamn hill, it's not Mount Everest. We are college educated people. We can find a way to get up that hill. God, help me. I hate this. We should have trained. You know, girlfriend... If you clicked to a lower gear, you might be able to make it up this hill. You okay there, man? -Jump in the back. I'll give you a lift to the top. -No, that's okay. What are you... Don't worry. By the time you reach the top, you'll have plenty of company, homeboy. Plenty. All right. Whoo! Whoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Awesome! Whoo! Oh, my God. Behold, that girl! The bi wonder lays in wait. Guys! You made it! Awesome hill, huh? Awesome hill... Look at this. Look at this. Isn't this incredible? I'm gonna die. Yeah, it's great. It's great. Come on. I waited for you guys. Let's ride down together. Come on. You guys are a bunch of pussies. Yeah. -Duh. -Yeah, come on. Hey, Gaetano. Did you see Frank? Oh, yeah... New York's one-piece caught a ride in the support van. No... What? Yeah. Just a little while ago. Son of a bitch. Doug, please... Not yet. I have to rest. I really do. He doesn't get this. Come on... Come on. No... No. Cool fight. Come on! Yeah! Is this table open? Great, thanks. How you doing? Rocco. -Frank. -Good to see you. So... You having fun? I don't know if this is what you would call fun, you know? I know. Tell me about it. You a Raiders fan? Yeah, Clippers too. But they're having a shitty year, as usual. They got the worst coach. I could go on about the Clippers for days. I wouldn't know anything about California teams. I'm from New York. Oh, New York, huh? The Yankees... They had a great season. Yeah... I had to suffer through it. I'm a Met fan. What can I say to you, huh? What can anybody say? So Frank, what color's your tent section? Blue. Oh, blue. Cool. 'Cause I brought my portable TV. We could, you know... What the fuck are you doing? Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know you had a boyfriend. Oh, please. Go back to New York. You don't belong here. That's pretty fucking obvious, isn't it? You don't get this. You're right. I don't get that. I never have and I never will. Chris asked you to do one thing. To do this ride. And you can't even honor that. Please... You don't know anything about my relationship with my brother, so don't pretend you do, okay? Excuse me for being a fussy prick. -That sounds appropriate. -But you don't even show up when he's dying? How many times did Melissa have to call you to try to get you out here? -How many times, Melissa? -I... -I was... -Guys, guys, guys. Come on. Let's settle this like gentlemen and have a dick measuring contest. What? Oh yeah, like you don't want to see his dick? Chris rode this two years ago. Every single mile, by himself. And no support vehicle helped him. Have some respect for that. Yeah. Not so hard, though. I like it hard. Don't get me wrong, just... Not all the time. Let me help you. -Ah! -Okay... You don't have to help. I can do it. I'm butch. I've been thinking about his face. It's different. Whose? Frank's. It's... harder. It's... -Stronger. -Too much testosterone. Those cops, they live on steroids. His nuts are probably the size of raisins. I don't think so. What is that supposed to mean? Okay, now... Put the little silver boy inside the little silver girl there. -Is this the little silver boy? -Yes it is. -Okay, and this is the little silver girl? -Mmm-hmm. Like that? -Look... -It's so heterosexual. I was just making a point about Frank. I don't believe this. You wanna bang him. I was just entertaining an intellectual concept. Your tongue is practically hanging out of your mouth. All right, so? Maybe I'm a little bit attracted to him. He looks exactly like Chris, you know. Tell me that you are not attracted to him. I'm not attracted to him. I see the way your eyes dance around when he bends over his bike in those little bike shorts. He has a nice ass. -Yes. -I hate that son of a bitch. I'd like to kick his butt. Nothing would be worse to a guy like that than to have his butt kicked by a homo. Fuck up his self-esteem for years. Yeah... Like that'll happen. All right... I want you to look me straight in the eye and tell me you're not attracted to him. Come on. Tell me... Tell me. Look, I don't wanna be funny or cute, all right? I want that fucking son of a bitch to pay for what he did to Chris. Don't you think he's already paying? Don't you think he realizes he missed out on having a brother because of his ignorance? Yeah, well... I'm glad you can be so compassionate. I can't. Guys like that, they never change. Never. And I don't give a fuck what his lame-o excuse is. It's not good enough. Congratulations. You all made it. He wanted you each to have these... after the first day of the ride. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's a... -It's a... -Theses are... -It's his ashes. -His ashes. It's a... he wants you to scatter these things somewhere along the route. You'll know when. I've had it with you people. What the hell is the matter with you? This is the sickest... most disrespectful fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. I know. It's so Chris. Are you okay? I'm sorry if that seemed insensitive back there, but... It was just, you know... Chris' dark sense of humor and... This is... This is all that's left of my twin brother. I'm sorry. You know... I always knew... that he was gay. When I was... twelve... I walked in on him and this kid, and... You know, I... I guess at the time, you just... You don't acknowledge it and then... It's like... It doesn't exist anymore, you know? I don't know. Unless he... He married you, and I thought... that... Doug was right. I don't... -I don't belong here. -No... No, look. Why do you think he... orchestrated all of this? Why did he... bring you here? Revenge? No. He loved you. Why? Why would he love me? Will you... ride along with me tomorrow? I can't believe this. Chris. Right? Well, I... Lola. I though... I'd never see you again. You... You look great. I wanted to thank you. For the advice. I don't remember... You don't remember me, do you? We only talked for like twenty minutes last year and, I never... ran into you again, but... I wanted you to know that... you changed my life. You were like... this angel. I thought I'd never see you again. This is great. Lola, what... What specifically did we... My family. You... gave me that long speech about coming out to people. How hard it was for you. But that it wasn't... your problem any longer. It was no longer killing you. How your... Your dad disowned you, but you were better off living in truth. I cried. I came out to my family. And everyone at work, and it changed everything. I'm finally okay with myself. It's been the best year of my life. So, how about you? Did your family... finally come around? I guess... They're starting to. I wanna be out of here in 10 minutes. You go ahead without me, okay? What? Yeah. I'm gonna ride with Frank today. I'll meet you at lunch. You're gonna ride with Frank? Yeah, you got a problem with that? In that? Yeah. I know what I'm doing. My number? I'm at a payphone. Oh... Yeah, sorry. Hold on. Okay, I got it. Okay, it's... It's 872... 806... 952... 56. Yeah. Yeah, I'm still here. Could you just please tell me what it is? No, I don't have any questions. No, I don't need counseling, thank you. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? -Saving your life, asshole. -Oh, my hero! Get off me. Jesus. And how could you scout on without me? I thought we were gonna do this together. Believe it or not, this isn't about you, Doug. This is between me and Chris. Look, I'm sorry. I thought you were high and, I was afraid you were going to hurt yourself. I'll let you know when I'm gonna kill myself, all right? What's that supposed to mean? Let's just say... my drug use is gonna be a lot less recreational from now on. What are you talking about? Bulletin, just in. Boy wonder fails blood test. Film at eleven. Don't even go there. Look... I shouldn't have said anything. Just leave me alone, all right, Doug? Look... I'm not gonna stand around and watch you self-destruct over this. Nobody's asking you to, okay? Don't do me any favors, Doug. I'm not into sitting in a circle and talking about what it feels like to be positive. You have friends who care about you, Gaetano. Then be my friend, Doug. Keep this to yourself, okay? Well... We've got to find your family. Oh, that's a brilliant fucking idea, Doug. That's fucking brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? We'll just... We'll just search every bar in the tri-state area, we'll drag my mother back to LA, and then she can take care of me 'til I fucking die. All I'm saying is that there are things you can do. You can get help. Aren't you just about helped out after Chris? This stays between me and you, you understand? You do not have my permission to tell Melissa. I don't need any help with this, Doug. Especially from you. -Hey. -Hey. Hi! Oh, boy. What do we got here? Free lemonade, huh? -Uh-huh. -Uh-huh. Want some? Oh, wow. This looks so good. -Did you guys make this yourself? -Yes. I gotta tell you... Mmm. That is some of the best lemonade I've ever had. Thank you. -Bye bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye! So you're not just a tough guy, huh? -I love kids. -Yeah? Yeah. I don't have any of my own, but... I had a girlfriend once. She had a couple of them. It was something else. What about you? You... You got a boyfriend now or anything? Nah. - Just a good video every now and then. You know, Frank. I really have not had the best luck with men. -I... -I love your brother, though. I know that. You know, Melissa, you could... get any guy you want. You just... - gotta choose a little better, I guess. Don't you want kids? Yeah. Yeah. I kind of think the boat's sailed on that one, though. Oh, please. You're a young, beautiful woman. I wouldn't kick you out of my bed. You know what? Chris and I had this deal when we got divorced that... if I didn't meet anybody by the time I hit 35... we'd have a kid. Really? -Yeah. -You mean, like he... he'd have sex with you? Yes. Oh... Sorry. Wrong tent. Are you Frank Cavatelli? Yeah. No mistake. Doug switched with me. He's rooming with Melissa. Come on, honey. Come on down here. Come on. Let me see your face. I won't bite you. There we go. How you doing? I'm Diva. You know... Like in "Diva Las Vegas." Pull up a rug, honey. 'Cause we tent-mates. What's wrong, baby? Oh... You one of them straight boys, ain't you? Well, don't worry, sugar. You can relax with me. Ain't no subtext here. 'Cause I don't play that shit, okay? If I wanna suck your dick, I'll tell you up front. "I wanna suck your dick." Now... One rule. You plan on entertaining... you stick this handkerchief out in front of the tent. I come by, I see it... I know you in here, doing the wild thing. Come on. Hey, look who I picked up. Stupid. Gaetano, come on. Let's go. -Lube. -What? Prevents chaffing. Trust me. Ugh. -What's the matter with you? -Nothing. You're acting all weird. I am weird. Good morning. Well, mister spritely. -What'd you do, get laid last night? -Oh, please. Where's Frank? How am I supposed to know, okay? Okay! Jesus. What did you do? Fuck him last night? Come on, give her a break. Let's get going, you guys. You didn't, did you? -It's 8:30. Come on, let's get going. -You slut. -Oh my God, you did. -You... Wait a minute! -Is his dick as big as Chris'? -Yes. I saw him in the shower. All right, fine. So I did him, okay? I know it was stupid, so just shut up about it, girls. Just shut up. Whoo! You were safe though, weren't you? You were safe. The only condom he had was full of ashes. You're kidding, right? Oh please, he's negative. Oh, really? -How can you tell? -He's a total straight guy, isn't he, Gaetano? I don't know. A couple of beers and... -Yeah, like Chris was a total straight guy. -All right, Doug. Come on! Besides the fact that you could get pregnant. You're smarter than this. Look, I knew Chris and Frank for fifteen years. They're the most trustworthy people I know. -Yeah, well Chris wasn't so trustworthy. -Shut up, Doug. What's that supposed to mean? Come on, guys. Let's go. I met him sooner than you think. Like I didn't know that. So... Marry fucking Frank! Have a little frankfurter! ♪ I have given I have given and got none ♪ Still I'm driven by something I can't explain ♪ It's not a cross It is a choice ♪ I cannot help but hear his voice ♪ I only wish that I could listen without shame ♪ Let it rain ♪ Let it rain ♪ On me ♪ Let it rain ♪ Oh let it rain ♪ Let it rain ♪ On me ♪ Oh my God, you guys, I'm so... I have the last room. I'm sorry. Ah! Don't go. Please. Last room. Look... I was so out of line. I am so sorry. Please. Stay with me, all right? Last room. Warm bed, hot bath. Cable TV. Porno channels. Come on. Yes. We got a room. Whoo! Whoo! Ha! Jesus. Look at this room! This is fucking great. I'm starving. See a menu over there? -Here. -Thank you. Ah. -Excuse me. -Look... I don't wanna check out of here and find 200 dollars worth of calls to 555-SUCK. All right? No phone calls. Whatever you say, grandma. Isn't it time to change your colostomy bag? Hey... Do you two want to share the bed? -No. -No. You sure? I'll just... Take that bed with Doug. I'll stay on the couch. Your loss. Hey, Doug! Don't your parents live around here? Mind your own business. Oh shit, is this mine? Yeah, I borrowed your eye drops. No, you didn't. No you didn't. Tell me you didn't. Oh my God, there's acid in here! Acid? Oh shit! LSD. I totally forgot to throw it away! -Are you bullshitting? -No, I swear to God. What kind of a moron puts LSD in his eye drops? -Rinse them out. -Chris, you have an hour before you start tripping. -You are so fucking dead. -What do you mean, I'm dead? You're the one who stole my eye drops. Take responsibility for your actions. Zoom! Okay. Whoo! You gotta try this. Get up, get up. Come on. Stand up... Okay... Okay... You okay? You okay? Okay... Okay, you're running down the hall. You turn left. You turn right. You run down the hall. You turn left. You turn right. Bam! You hit a wall. Hey... -You seen Frank? -Yeah, he... He had to call his parents. He needed privacy. Hey, honey. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. -Stop. -He's fucked up. -Stop. Give me the phone. Sure. Here you go. Who you gonna call? Huh? I'm gonna call my parents. And tell them I'm a big fucking homo. -That's great. -Doug, look... You're very high, honey. And I don't think now is the time to tell Mommy and Daddy... about your sexuality. -Okay? -No, I'm fine, really. I'm perfectly rational. I... I understand what I'm doing. -Okay... -And I want to call my mom and dad. What are you gonna tell them? I'm gonna say, "Mom, Dad... "I'm a big fucking homo." -Okay, be my guest. -This, I gotta see. He's not gonna do it. He can't even dial. Hi, Mom! No, I'm fine. Is dad there? Could you put him on the phone? Hi, Dad. Mom... Dad... Speak to Melissa. Hello? - Rachel? - Doug. Hi! -Oh, yeah... -Doug... Doug... Yeah, I got that salt shaker. It was great, it was lovely. We're at the Madonna Inn. Oh... Really? That close, huh? Oh, no. We wouldn't want to inconvenience you. We're friends. We have friends here, so... Well, that's really sweet, but... Okay! Uh-huh, okay. Yeah. All right. Okay. Bye. Your mom's coming to pick us up. She insists we stay at her house. -No. -No. That's probably not a very good idea. You cannot take a tripping man to his parents' house. So, I guess mister curious, sitting in my brand new car... And he puts the car in reverse, it rolls down the driveway... right into the street. I almost had a heart attack. Rachel... Again with that story? Please. -So what happened? What did you do? -What did I do? I gave him such a smack on his ass, he'll never forget it, right? And then I took him and gave him a big hug and a kiss, and I told him how I loved him more than anything else in the whole world. Awe... Dougie, it's so... Do you want some more wine, honey? -No, no... -And you, you don't drink. -Thanks for remembering. -So, tell me... What are you doing out here, sweetie? What are you doing here? -Would you pass the gravy? -Sure. Thanks. -Can I have the salad please? -Sure, Melissa. It's so good to see you. God forbid Doug ever comes to his senses and marries you, huh? I know, I'm... I'm hip. It's just a... sex thing, right? -That's very funny, Rachel. -You don't know how funny. So, you still got that... pot store, Dougie? I don't sell pot. -Sss. -It's terracotta. And it's fine terracotta, huh? All right, so tell me. What is this bike ride? It's... It's for Tourette's. What are you talking about? I read in the paper, it's for AIDS. So, now why are you all doing this bike ride for AIDS? Chris... That's what he died of. I thought you told me Chris died of a heart attack. Douglas, stop playing with your food, will you? Hello? Hi, it's Gaetano. I'm sorry. I'm looking for my sister, Lucy. Gaetano. Gaetano Amador. Oh. Do you know where she moved to? Do you have a forwarding number or anything like that? I'm sorry for calling so late. -Good morning. -Good morning. Oh, God. He snores louder than Chris did. Yeah, and he drools too. I relived my entire childhood last night. I'm exhausted. You know what? You have a bad attitude. They are nice people. You should just come right out and tell them that you're gay. Oh, God. Shh. Come on, please. You know my mom, she could hear through poured concrete. Look... Then you can stop de-homo-fy-ing the apartment and get on with your life. Look, all right. Enough about this, okay? I go easy on you with certain things. Oh, yeah? Like what? What? Come on, why don't you just say you think I'm a loser, coffee slacker chick? Come on! I can take it. You wanna know what I think? Yes. I think you are the most beautiful, intelligent, talented woman I know. That's what you've been holding back? But I don't understand. Why have you stopped writing? Why don't you find someone new? It's like you're just stalled in your life. It's like you have no ambition. Chris used to tell me that when you were at Yale, there was no stopping you. That's enough, okay? Let's just not... No... Oh, God. I miss Chris. I miss being married to him. Oh, God. It's been seven years. So fucking pathetic. He was gay. It wasn't your fault. There was nothing you could do. I know it wasn't my fault. I know it wasn't your fault, I know it wasn't his fault. And I know I couldn't have fucked him straight if I tried. But... that doesn't change the fact that I feel that the love of my life was ripped away from me. It's okay. Oh hi, Mom. Hi, honey. I like your friends. Oh, good. They had a good time last night. Thanks for doing that. You know, it reminded me of a long time ago, when I was a young girl at college. Yeah? I used to hang out with this group of girls. During spring break, we'd hang out at Myrtle Beach. It was like, where the boys are. I had a lot of fun then. It was a wonderful time. Anyway... There were these two girls, Beth and Lynn. And they always insisted on having their own room. Anyway, they were very funny, and they were terrific girls. But... something was going on there. You could just tell. They had this strange kind of connection between them. I mean, we never brought it up, we never talked about it, but... It was there. Eventually... they met two wonderful men, they got married, they had children... -So, Dougie... -Mom... -What? Is there something you want to ask about me? No... Let me rephrase that. -I need to tell you something. -I don't want to know. How do you know you don't want to know? Because if it's what I think it is... I don't want to know. Then you know. Maybe, but I just don't want to know. -So why can't I tell you? -Because then I would really know. You know I know, so why tell me? -Because I need to know you know. -No. Because then I would really know. -Hey! -Hey. You got another cigarette? Sure. Oh... Thanks. -Mind if I join you? -No, no. Thanks. -Hey, are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. I had no idea... I was gonna get so emotional on this thing. Yeah, tell me about it. It was very strange. I was just meditating... Wow. I always wanted to meditate but never had the time. -Oh, you should try it. It's good. -Yeah. So, I'm meditating... and... suddenly, my son is right next to me. He just... He kind of sat down. And... He says to me... "Mom... I'm okay." And then... he smiled at me and... and disappeared. Yeah... Wow. It's okay. That really is okay. Argh. -Shit. -You need some help? I can fix it. How am I supposed to get that out? Is that why you're turning your pedals the wrong way to try to put your chain back on? It doesn't go the other way. Here. Let me try. Why are you doing this? Cyclist courtesy. Look, I don't want your help, okay? You got a problem with me? What, do you hate straight people? No, some of my best friends are straight. In fact, last year I went to the straight parade. Please. You're a heterophobe. Oh, God. Look, you don't know anything about me. He wrote me. Did you know that? For the last three years. Until right before he died. You're full of shit. Told me all about you. All about his store and... his illnesses. He never said anything about writing. Why would he write you? You haven't spoken to him in years. Towards the end, when he stopped writing, that's when I knew that... Things had gotten really bad. So why didn't you call? I don't know. I guess it was all just... too much and... Look, I see now. He had this whole life out here. And I'm trying. You have to understand, we came from a... a very traditional Italian family. You tell me. What kind of a family abandons their son. Please. Don't judge my family. They're good, decent people. You haven't even come out to your own family. You ever think that maybe you're scared they'll react the same way mine did? Think about it. My father made the decision to disown Chris. And he made us choose, the family or Christopher. And we chose. And when he died, my mom would sit and cry, and my father wouldn't comfort her. You know why? Because he couldn't. Don't you get it? He's an old man. This is what he always believed. What he was taught to believe. So you're father's a narrow-minded bigot. That's your excuse. You're really a self-righteous prick, you know that? I know I fucked up. I failed my only brother and I have to live with that for the rest of my life. The one thing I don't have to live with is your shit. 'Cause I don't owe you nothing. Beunos Dias. How do you say... My cousin. I lose my cousin. It's a charity. From all of us. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. -Are you okay? -Settle down, settle down. Relax. Move away, I'm a police officer. Hey. Oh, boy. -Anybody got a cell phone? -The ambulance is on its way. Listen... Stop moving around so much, okay? -Just take it easy. -All right. Let's get this helmet off of you. Okay. Okay. Don't touch my blood. You're gonna be fine. -I'm gonna be all right. -It's all right. I'll come along with you. Is he okay? Yeah. What happened? He crashed. He was... drunk. Jesus. Are you nuts? You know, Doug. We should have taken better care of him. I never should have let him get away with all that shit. Oh, come on. This is nothing new. He's positive. You wouldn't believe how much blood comes out of your head. Why didn't you tell me? Why? You know, you're selfish. I know you better than you think. I know exactly what you're doing. Why do you have to act like I'm a burden on your buzz? I don't... Why? I love you. I don't stop loving you when it's not convenient. You disappear for weeks. I'm... right here, still loving you. You come and go whenever the hell you want. And that... That's what breaks my heart more than anything you could tell me. I don't wanna break your heart, Melissa. That's why I told Doug not to tell you. You knew? Wait a second. You guys keep shit from me... It's just not okay anymore. No. I'm better than that. I'm going home. I don't even care what Chris wanted. I've had it with all of you. Straight, gay... Whatever. Melissa, why don't... Thanks. I think I was too hard on them back there. It's all right. I always respected women with balls. If I had had a real set, maybe I would have been able to keep Chris. -That was terrible. -Whoa. You know... Frank, I'm sorry. I just... I can't figure out where you begin and where Chris ends. It's so... I'm sorry. I think I can understand that. You still mad at me? Look, Melissa... I don't know why I told Doug and not you. I guess... I don't know... I guess I'm just afraid of depending on people. But I know in my heart that you really care about me. I know that you really love me. I guess... I need my friends right now. We're not like your family. -We're not going anywhere. -I know. You know, I've been... I've been waiting for this cycle thing to end so I could bring Chris' ashes back to his family. Don't you think that's a little ridiculous? I mean, his family is right here. We should scatter his ashes together. I already scattered mine. Ditto. What about you, Doug? Have you? No. Look... I know you don't like me very much. But it would mean a lot to me... if I could do this for my brother with someone... who loved him... and took good care of him. Come on, Doug. Doug, please. Please what? In order for Frank and me to scatter my dead gay husband to the four winds, I have to get my ash-filled condom! Son of a bitch. ♪ True love can last forever ♪ So every heart is told ♪ Doug! It's your mom and dad! -Hey, Rachel! -Hey!
