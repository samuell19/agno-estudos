The story of the dove, by Autumn west, second grade. One day, I came home from school and saw mommy dove outside my bedroom window. She had a big tummy, and was building a nest just below the window. I don't know where the daddy was. Maybe they were divorced. She was very beautiful and gentle. Her cooing made me want to close my eyes and fall asleep. She wasn't afraid of me at all. I asked my mom why she wasn't afraid, and she said the dove knew she was safe with me. So the dove built her nest, had her baby, and I kept them safe. But today, when I came home from school, I saw 2 gigantic crows flying away. There were small white feathers all over the driveway and some other yucky blood and stuff. The baby dove was gone, probably killed or murdered by the crows. The mommy dove kept on walking around in circles. When she looked at me, I told her I was sorry, but it didn't help. She kept on walking around in circles. She had been betrayed. Come on, Autumn. I just want to try and understand where you got that idea for the ending. But, mom.... She did lose her baby. I mean, has your father been supervising your television? W-What kind of shows is he letting you watch? It was just so violent. It's true. I mean, why would anyone want to hurt a dove anyway? That's the point, honey. Nobody would. I mean, you can't always assume the worst. Just because you don't see the little... See? I'm sorry, honey. This is so cool, mom. It's nearly midnight, and we're having a pizza party. Do you know that my mommy and I used to do this when I was little? Every once in a while, we'd have a party at night in bed. Pizza? Nope. Chocolate covered entenmann's donuts breyers vanilla ice cream with the bean... Did you hear something? I like scary noises. You sure you're not just a little bit frightened? Nah. You could take care of US. All right then. Well, mommy's just gonna go downstairs and make sure the doors are locked, ok? All right. Wait here. Don't look at my cards. Promise? I promise. Ok, I'll be right back. Mommy? Is somebody following you? Is that what you said on the phone to una? No, sweetheart. Adults just say silly things sometimes. Well, how come you had an alarm system put in? You know, Autumn, you're just too smart for me. Mommy just wants US to be safe, that's all. Mom? Maybe I'm a little scared. Honey, there's nothing to worry about. Look. Look, honey, it's just a bird. You see? It's ok. Mommy! Ok, honey, let's... let's go. Come on. Come on, Autumn. Mom, no! That's the painter's ladder! Wait here. Come on now. Mommy'll help you. I can't! I hate ladders! Autumn, it's just like the one at the playground. Autumn, look. Honey, it's safe. Aah! Aah! See? See? I told you! Aah. Mommy! Where are you?! You're gonna have to jump, honey. Mommy's gonna catch you. Autumn, you come over this balcony this instant! No. I'm sorry, honey. Please. You're just gonna have to jump. Somebody help me! Aah! Aah! Aah! Jeez. Sid, is that you? Yeah, it's me. I'm so sorry. It's ok. The alarm, it went off, and... What are you doing here? Are you all right? Yeah, I thought I'd bring you some homemade chicken soup. Sid. I'm sorry. Jeez. No, the alarm was put in just yesterday. I... hold on a second. I need your autograph here, Mrs. West. Sorry for all the confusion. If you have any more problems, just hit the panic button. I taught your friend how to shut it off. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. I'm gonna get going, ok, honey? I'll see you at the office tomorrow. I'll show him out. Thanks. Good night. Good night. I'm sorry I scared you. It's all right. Drive safely. Good night, Mrs. West. Jack, you still there? What did you get an alarm for, anyway? You got nothing anybody wants. You always manage to say the nicest things, Jack. I have the most precious thing in the world here. It's called my daughter. Yeah, well, that's good. Listen, um, it's almost 1:00 in the morning. Can we talk about this later? I... Why are you whispering? I have company. You make it sound like you have friends over for brunch. Hey, I refuse to feel guilty. We've been separated for 6 months now. Come on, I'm not a monk, you know? I need a favor, Jack. You name it, kiddo. I may have to go into the hospital, to have minor surgery, and I'll... I'll need you to help me with Autumn. What is it? What's the matter? Don't pretend you're concerned. Well, I am. Do you really want to know? I may... I may have to have my tonsils taken out. You're ton... I thought it was something serious for a minute. You are really an asshole. Heh heh heh heh. Hey, it's not like you're having a mastectomy or something? Although even that could be considered minor surgery. You prick! Goddamn alarm system. Thank you. You know that guy that I thought was following me? It turns out to be one of sid's relatives. Who? I don't know. Just some little guy who was just too shy to come up to me. I mean, I put in that alarm system for nothing. What you should have done is told your friends in the first place. You know we'll take care of you. I know, una. I do want it to be like old times. It's just the separation from Jack and trying to make ends meet and being a good mommy. You are a good mommy. You're a great mommy. Let's make a toast. Yeah? Here's to being a great mommy. Right. I hope you hear this. What's wrong, Ellie? I can always tell when something's wrong. Well, if I do have to have an operation... Please. It's not a real operation. It's ice cream and ginger ale, remember? God, you know how I hate hospitals. And... And? What if my chart gets switched with a... Rectalectomy. Honey, when you meet Dr. Jesse Peter, you're gonna wish your chart got switched to a pap smear. Believe me. God, una. You would know. Actually, Jesse and I aren't seeing each other anymore. Besides, I've told him... I've told him all about you. No. You didn't. I did. Why did you do that? Because I think you two would be really cute together. I mean, you're definitely his type. Now, what's that supposed to mean? Let me see. honest, hardworking, idealistic. You know, all that sort of stuff. He works at a great hospital. I liked my doctor. I'm sure you did, but he's the best. He's a specialist. Why is everyone always playing matchmaker with me? We all want to see you with someone great. Yeah, sure. Everyone thinks I can't take care of Autumn by myself. That I need a man. It's not that at all. We just want to see you happy. My god, I have to go. I'm late. Sid worries sick about me when I'm late. Sid's gonna kill you with worry. You tell him that I found you a guy first, ok? See ya. Hey, hey. Dr. Peter? I want to know everything. Enough out of you! Late. Not too late to meet my cousin Norman. He's 5'3", he disappears in a crowd, he can hide behind someone 5'4". He didn't mean to follow you. That was a mistake. He's just shy. But he's a hell of a guy. Sid, I can pick my own men. But you need someone. I'm must trying to get you a head start. Now, there's a lot of guys in my family. Very eligible, some reasonably attractive. I want you to have the cream. Sid! All right. It's none of my business. Aah... But I know people. Hey, take these two. Jamaica, grand lido. Alaska, cruise, 5 bucks. You win, 5 bucks. I win, you meet my cousin Norman, the lawyer. Deal. Won't you come this way, please. So, how can I help you? We're looking for a real swinging spot for our honeymoon. You know, water ski, snorkel, dance. Have you ever been to Alaska? Ok. Telefono. Tu mama. Ma! Hi, sweetheart. How's the play date going? It's ok. Yeah? Is everything else ok? Chill out, mom. US girls can take care of ourselves. Dr. Peter. What, mom? Nothing, honey. I'm at the doctor's. I'm gonna be home as soon as i'm... As soon as I'm done. We're ready for you now. Right, I gotta go, sweetheart. Now, you sure you're all right? Don't worry, mom. And if you gotta get a shot, don't be scared. Just take a deep breath and think of good things. I will. Bye. You'll never believe what my daughter just said to me. Is this really necessary? Ellie, the oral antibiotics your doctor prescribed you are not effective. I'm gonna have to get rid of the infection first and foremost. Yes, but a shot? Really? I'll tell you what. You close your eyes and it'll all be over in a minute. I can't close my eyes. All right, I'll close mine. Wait a second. You're the doctor. I don't know what a good idea that is. Thank you. That wasn't so bad, was it? You're done. She gave me the shot. No, she gave me the shot. Why, do you want one? Helen! No. Pass. I'm gonna have to monitor you closely. The chronic inflammation in conjunction with the deep invaginations on the dark side of the palatine means... The tonsils are gonna have to come out. Are you getting enough rest? Rest? I have a job, a daughter, I'm not married. I know. Una told me. Right, una. In lieu of your hectic schedule, how about I make dinner? No, no, no, no. That... That would just never work out. Why? Well, i... I, um, spend nights with my daughter. I don't know if she told you that part, but... Well, then, how about for you and your daughter... Autumn, isn't it? Right. Autumn. Well, maybe if I could prepare dinner. But the whole point is that you need rest. Please let me. I'll barely lift a finger. Autumn, black or white? Black. Aah! Ok... is that him?! It better not be. The food is not here yet. Keep the change. Are you ok? Aah! Is that him?! Ok. All right. All right. Light the garbage and I will hide the candles. Go! No! Come here! I will... I will light the candles, then you'll hide the garbage. Go! Hi. Hi. Thank you. You're welcome. Do you... do you want to come in? No, I just thought i'd... Sure. Yeah. Quick! Throw me the ball! Autumn, you ok? My... I'm so sorry. I... i... Hey... hey now... Come on. Step into my office. Ooh! What do we have here? What's that here? It really hurts. I know. What do you suggest we do? Operate? Yes! I... well, on second thought, I don't think that's necessary, unfortunately. But what else? I hit my head once and mommy put ice on it. Ice! You know, you're a genius. That's exactly what it needs. Why don't we go get some, ok? Come on. Well, you know, doctors get paid a lot of money for prescribing ice. Not as much as bartenders, of course. I want to be a veterinarian. You do? Well, take it from me you're going to be a fabulous vegetarian. Veterinarian, silly. I'm terribly sorry. Did I say that? Come on. Did you know that the lobe is an unexplored island of sensitivity? You're not kidding. You're wound up pretty tight. Well, what would the good doctor prescribe? Well, I'm basically an ears, nose, and throat man myself. I know what you're thinking. The answer is... it's just no. Mommy? Aah! Hi, sweetheart. Thank you for examining my ears, doctor. Your throat's not so bad, either. Can I cuddle with you guys? Um... no, sweetheart. How come? Well... Because. It was ok with daddy. One minute. Mommy? I can't sleep. Can you read to me? Autumn, honey, I have... We have company. Please? Just for a minute? Ok. You get undressed, get into bed. I'll be right back, ok? All right. Pick a story out. I'm sorry. Being a mommy comes first. I understand. Listen, I had a wonderful time. Me, too. When can I see the two of you again? Well, I'd say tomorrow, but I don't want to scare you. Ok. How about tomorrow? Boo. Eek. Good night. Good night. Sid? Mommy? Sid, is that you? Who is it? Autumn, stay in your room. I'll be there in a minute. Sid? Jack! No. It was my first date in 6 months, and Jack shows up drunk at my back door. He was mumbling something about the alarm system. He finally passed out on my sofa. I once saw a show about restraining orders. No. I mean, Jack's a jerk, but he's harmless. You haven't said a word about Jesse. Rumor has it you two really hit it off. Did you talk to him already? Yeah, I talked to him. I'm not telling you. You know, this is a new role for me. You don't have to rub it in. He has the most beautiful eyes. Watch it. Well, keep still, please. Well, I've got to run, kiddo. I'm really happy for you. Hey, una... do me a favor. Yeah. Name it. Scrape your nails on a blackboard, call me bubba... Anything but kiddo. Consider it done. I'll talk to you later, ok? Una? Yeah? Thanks for, you know... Ok. Bye. Choo! Allergies. Are you the creep from the collection agency? No, no. I'm the bet. The bet? Yeah, well, you know... sid's cousin, Norman. You know... the lawyer. The fella you thought was following you. I'm so sorry. Please, have a seat. I'm... I'm Ellie. Hi, Ellie. Yeah? I won. Pay up. I'm working. Take a break. Choo! Here. Kleenex? Thank you. This is very embarrassing. I mean, whenever I get nervous, I have these sneezing attacks, and I'm a shy fellow, and... Choo! God bless you. Thank you. So, you're a lawyer? Yep. I'm one of those, yeah. Everyone in the family wanted me to be a doctor, but i... no, with my fragile immune system, I would never have lived through pre-med. I could have used a good lawyer a few months ago. I know. Sid explained it all to me. He did? Well, see, I'm a criminal lawyer, and divorce isn't my field, but i... i know that a divorce can be a very traumatic experience. You must be glad that it's behind you now? Well, I mean, it's not final, but it may as well be. Say... Would... would you like to, um... Go to a movie with me some night or something? Norman, you seem very sweet, and this... It's not personal... I'll take an actifed before the first show. Norman, I'm just not, um... I... I'm just... Look, i... I'm not... not... not coming on to you romantically or anything. I... i was just thinking that... well, maybe we could go to a movie and just... Talk maybe. Just friends? Just friends. Ok. Hey, it's me. Is she ready? Let's go. Autumn, your father's here. Get your things. Hi, Jack. How you doing, kiddo? Ok. Thanks for getting here on time. New car? Yeah, right. You didn't read your lawyer's financial evaluation of me. I couldn't afford the gas for that thing. No, that's a lease. Good for business. What business are you in nowadays? Same old, same old. You know, I got a deal here, a deal there. Here or there? I don't seem to remember a here or a there. Well, that's good. That's very nice, kiddo. Very funny. Jack, we do need to talk. I'm having trouble with Autumn's tuition. I have a cracked muffler. My boiler... Hey, I'm tapped out, all right? Leave me alone. Let me tell you something, Jack... Hey, sweetheart. Hi. Hi, daddy. Mommy... could I stay with you guys? Hey, you're coming with me this weekend. You're gonna have some fun with your daddy. Yeah, Autumn. Autumn, you forgot your jacket. Hi. This is... Jesse. Yeah. Ok. You are gonna love your daddy's new car. Wow. It's really cool. Check it out. It is, isn't it? Well, he seems real comfortable. You didn't waste any time. Listen to me, you son of a bitch, I've had enough of your snide remarks to last me a lifetime. I've got more. Are you supervising her television, by the way? No... I don't have a TV. Yeah, right. Autumn, put your seat belt on. Have a wonderful weekend, sweetie. Hi. Hey. When was that taken? Right after Jack and I got married. We honeymooned in Mexico. He got himself involved in some crazy business deal. God, it was just such a mess from the beginning. Except for Autumn. Damn. Shh. Relax. Relax and breathe. Breathe in... Breathe out. Breathe in... Breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. This is all very weird. What could possible be weird about this? Everything. Everything. How about this? Boy. You know, you don't know this about me, but I'm the kind of person who takes everything literally. Like, for example, if you were to say to me... i don't know, um... I wanna make love to you. I would... I'm the kind of person who would take that literally. How am I supposed to take that? Literally. god. What a weekend. My god. The one-strike pitch: Nixon whacks and fouls it off to the pirate dugout on the first base side. God, what a weekend. She's asleep. You can come out now. I thought she'd never pass out. She's not here that often. Good. Doesn't this guy have anything better to do with his money? Flowers, flowers. Day in, day out. Flowers. It looks like a funeral parlor around here. I thought you'd be happy for me, sid. I finally found a great guy. Yeah, but he's not a relative. What about Norman? Norman. Norman. Norman. I like Norman. We're gonna go to the movies tonight. So what's your big shot-doctor-prince charming gonna say about that? Why? He has nothing to worry about. Thrilled to hear it. Besides, he has to work late. Una's gonna stay over and help me with Autumn, take me to the hospital tomorrow. Look, I know that Norman is not a big shot doctor, and granted, he's not the most attractive guy in the world, but let me tell you something about this man. He's a good stickball player. He's good to his mother. I could relate to that guy. I think every man... There's a certain sensitivity. Well, I've never seen a kick boxer movie before. I-I like all kinds of movies... as long as they're in color. Black and white makes me uncomfortable. Ok. I know. I know. You had the worst time of your life. No, it was not the worst time of my life. Really? Really? Yes. You're not just saying that? Why are you still awake? Well, we've been drawing. You know, she's quite a little artist. Did you like the movie, mom? She hated it. No. Yeah, she hated it so much, she wouldn't even eat her popcorn. No eating 24 hours before surgery. Doctor's orders. Jesse is so cool. Sid told me all about Jesse. I think it's very healthy for a woman to date 2 men at the same time. Autumn, why don't you go get upstairs, and I'll tuck you in to bed in a minute, ok? Ok. Ok. Go on. Good night. Well, it was very nice to meet you, Norman. Ellie's told me wonderful things... well, you know... No... i mean, yes... thank you. Well, I guess I'll... go take a bath. Well, you don't need any help from US, do you? No. Thank you. Good night. Night. Night. Just friends. Just friends... no, I was about to sneeze on you. That's why I was glad you caught me. Well, I had a really good time tonight. I mean, I know you hated the movie and everything, but I had a nice time. Norman, I had fun, too. You did? Well... but you hated the movie, and I know, because you see an awful lot of movies, so... How do you know that? Well, I had a friend run a credit check on you. What? Of course. Just to see the kind of things... Jeez, Norman! Where you go to shop, and what you like... What kind of thing is that to do to anybody? Well, just one of the things I found out is you use your credit card an awful lot to go to the movies. Norman, that's an invasion of privacy. Nah. Lawyers are like that. You know, when you date nowadays, you got to know something about the other person, and a credit check is the best way to find out. I mean, like your credit, for example. It was fine till you met Jack, and then... pfft... bingo, out the window. Believe me, don't I know it. But what's strange is Jack's credit when he was married to you, and now it's as different as night and day. What do you mean? Well, he's squeaky clean. No. You must have a different Jack west. I don't know. It's the same social. It would cost him a fortune to get a credit repair job. Yeah, but why... why would he bother? I don't get it. Well, let's say that... That he wants to buy into a major company that's a public company. No. I mean, he just doesn't have that kind of money. You... you must have the wrong Jack west. Same social. Excuse me. Ellie? Sorry to bother you. Um, could you show me where the spare towels are? Not now, una. I'll be there in a minute. Ok. What kind of deal? 7 figure stuff. You know, it takes a lot of money to make a big play like that. Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I better be going. Well, drive safely. You know I will. I always do. Good night. Good night, Norman. Sid has my number. Son of a bitch! What? That son of a bitch is hiding money from me and my baby. I mean, I don't know if it's true, but... You can't worry about that now. We have to pack. You've got to get up early in the morning. You know, you're going to the hospital... Ok? Yeah, ok. All right. Dr. Bruce, telephone, please. I want to talk to my lawyer. Yes, well, I am more unreachable than he is. I'm sedated. She doesn't sound sedated. This is gonna knock the wind right out of her sails. You just tell him that my husband is trying to pull a fast one... whoa! In a minute, she won't care if her husband's dating a donkey. Ok. Wow! Hello? Yes. You just tell him that when I get out of this hospital, i'm... i'm... I'm going to go... To Disneyland. Go to Disneyland. Would you like to go with me? Wow. How you doing, champ? Hi. Yeah. It looks like it's getting smaller all the time. And how's my patient? You drive me crazy! Ooohhh! I see you've been prepped. Man! It's wonderful! You should get prepped, too! What's the matter? No! Ellie, we're gonna be taking you to O.R. soon. Everything will be ok. Aah! Aah! No! No! There's nothing to be afraid of. No! No! Aah! Aah! No! Aah! Aah! It'll all be over soon. Why... why... why would anybody want to hurt a dove? You... you have the most beautiful eyes. Ooh. Ja vol. Good choice. Anything less macabre? This isn't heart surgery, you know. You want the theme from deep throat? How about some hammer? Rap? Strictly prostate. Is that remark racist or sexist? We play I am woman every tube tie. You are such a child. Ok. The candy store is open. I got a million of 'em. Haven't been testing the merchandise lately, have you, Gabe? You know one anaesthesiologist who doesn't have a sweet tooth? And they're off. 130 over 80. Pulse 87. 3.5%. You've done this before, haven't you? There's nothing like the smell of fried flesh first thing in the morning. Just another second. Drop it down below 3. Going down. Lingerie, David lynch, fellini. What are you doing for lunch, Gabe? What do you got in mind? Just food. Damn! Looking good, Gabe. Shed a few pounds? God, I hate being a sex object. Blood pressure's dropping. What do you got? 80 over 50. She's not ventilating. 41. Hook the tube. Fuck! Come on. Drag it out. We're losing her. - 17. How could this be happening? Atropine, goddamn it! One milligram. Check the airway, Gabe. It's clear. It's all clear. Stay with US. Come on. Lidocaine now! V-fib. Shit! Flatline. Flatline! That is not possible! Epi! Epi! Charge. Clear. Nothing. Charge. Clear. Nothing. Charge. Clear. We got something. 47. 80 over 60. 89 over 64. That ain't too bad. You ok, doctor? Shit. Jesse, what the hell do you want from me? Look, I'm sorry that your lady friend had such... You still shooting the fentanyl, Gabe? Jesse, you got to be out of your mind to think... What the hell were you doing back there?! Jesse, she was friggin' hypoxic, man. The endotracheal tube wasn't ventilated... Bullshit! Classic symptoms. Wrong dilutions of epinephrine! You son of a bitch! You almost killed her! Fucking asshole. You broke my fucking nose! You listen to me. You're through here. You're finished. You're history. I'm gonna bring you before the board and make sure you can't get a job in a fucking pharmacy! He hasn't moved since she came in here. Everything will be all right. I love you. Is mommy all right? She's gonna be just fine. What happened? Dr. Peter's gonna take care of everything. Your mom's gonna be good as new, ok? I'll be right back. I don't think you should go in there. It wouldn't be good for you or her, you get it? I'll tell you... but mommy... Shut up! Jesus, Jack. Would you relax? Autumn... I wanna see my mommy! I know you want to see your mommy. Listen... Can I trust you to be strong? I'm gonna let you peek through the window, but it's not gonna look very good. There's lots of machines and wires, but your mommy's gonna be just fine. She's only sleeping, ok? Are you ready? Ok. Don't worry, mom. Just take a deep breath and think of good things. I want to know what the fuck happened. Don't tell me to calm down, you asshole. You blew it. I don't want to hear your fucking excuses. Your part of this deal was to kill her. Subtle? There's nothing subtle about dead. Look, dead is just fucking dead. All right. No, I just want to meet with you. I don't give a shit how dangerous it is. He hung up on me, that fuck. Calm down, baby. You know I'll take care of everything, don't you? I wasn't cut out for this shit. You smoke and drink too much. You'll make yourself sick. You know, you're gonna kill yourself one of these days. Talking about this drug and that drug. Dilutions, 200,000 parts. Jesus! What am I? A fucking anaesthesiologist? That was his job. You're getting dangerous, Jack. You know, when you wound up drunk at Ellie's back door the other night, I'm surprised you didn't tell her everything. Jesus. Who are you? Who... i mean, who the fuck are you to tell me... Without me, you're nothing. Fuck you. Later. Without me, you had a worthless shell of a company. I brought my friend into it. Without me, you're nothing. I would have turned that company around. That was my company. I... Sure, Jack. We all need each other. You, me, and him. If you want the money, you better keep cool. I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. He's supposed to know everything there is to know about drugs. What do we do now? We do it ourselves. Yeah, right. Remember that drug he was telling US about? Bethanical. She's in the hospital. What a perfect place for heart failure. Yeah. Where do we get the drug? I'll get it. He owes US. No, I can't do it. You don't have to, babe. I'll take care of everything. You are one cold bitch, kiddo. I'm glad you're on my side. You're clear. All right. Hey, where do you think you're going? Hey, buddy. 3, please. Aaarrrggghhh. Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing? No, no, no. It's me. It's me. Norman. What? It's me, for crying out loud. Norman?! What's gotten into you? This thing's beginning to give me a rash. The spup? Is he cute? Is this a cute man? I said "spot," you understand. Is this a beautiful man? Such a heart. Parents? Hi. This is my cousin Norman. We just dropped in to get a good price on a lobotomy. Could you help US? You came to the right place. Yeah... you might be looking for this. It's just a hobby of mine. I'm sort of a back-seat doctor. Well, then you'd want proctology. It's just down the hall to the... That's very cute. Come on, let's go. We'll see you later. Come on. It's feeding time, Kong. Thank you, fellas. If you need US, we'll be right outside. Can I stay? Sure. You scared the hell out of me. I did? How badly? Almost lost you. I find myself in situations with patients daily, and they... they just go. They go. I... You mean so much to me. You've got such spirit. I couldn't have saved you without it. I hear you make great waffles. She wouldn't let go. She was like a magnet. I took her on my late rounds. Una seemed more than happy to let me take her for the night. When can I taste... your waffles? Honey, anytime. I think I got some on me somewhere here. I think that monkey took them. I got a better idea. I know a place where just the 3 of US could go. It's on the beach. It's a paradise. I've always wanted... To go to paradise. Hey. It hurts? It's hard to swallow. I bet. Better take a look. Open. Once again. And one more. And there's nothing like the smell of frying flesh first thing in the morning. What did you just say? I'm not sure. I'll check up on you in a couple hours. He looks like the same Jack west. He had a gold mine with that computer information network, and now he's in heavy on it, and they're gonna take it public. I'm surprised you didn't skywrite it outside of Ellie's window. Well, what do you want me to do, sid? He's her husband, and he's scamming her. All right. All right. Look into it, but do not, I repeat, do not tell her anything. Now report to me. Do you understand? She doesn't need the aggravation. You got it? Right. Let's get out of here. Hi, doc. How's our girl? Hi. She's doing great. That's nice. She's doing really well. Why can't you be more like him? Him? Him. Don't start, sid. Hiya, boys. Can I go in? Sure. I like a man with hair on his chest. I like woman with hair on her head. Peek-a-boo. Hello? Una. Hi. How are you doing? Great, I guess. God, it sure makes you wonder. It sure does. Here you go, sweetie. This for you. What do you say? Thank you. My pleasure. I brought you this. I remembered how much you liked them. A chocolate milk shake. What's the matter, babe? I... i get these feelings. Almost like I can remember... Remember what? I don't know. Tell you what. You wipe the slate clean, you know? All bad thoughts can go to hell. Right? You said it. Enjoy it. You deserve it. Can I have some? No, babe. See, because your mommy's got a really sore throat. You know? And she just had an operation. She's only allowed to have liquids. Ok? It's ok, sweetie. You can have a sip. I'm gonna take Autumn tonight. I think that's best. I thought I was gonna stay with Jesse. No, you're gonna stay with me, ok? Sweetie, go with una. Let me get your jacket. We'll have lots of time to spend with Jesse. Tonight I want to know you're home safe in your own bed, ok? Yes, mom. Don't worry. You know your baby's gonna be safe with me, don't you? Ok, say good-bye to your mommy. Good-bye, sweetie. I love you. I love you, too. Go wait outside. Sleep well. Ok? Ok. You look great. Ok. Bye. You think we can go in? I think we can go in. Bye, boys. It's about time. See you, sid. Bye, norm. See you, kiddo. Why don't you take off that monkey suit? I can't. I left my pants in the trunk of my car. Besides, I'm getting... i'm getting a rash or something. I... Cheetah and Tarzan, you want to say ciao to the lady so I can give her her medication, please? Medication? For the pain? Yes! Dr. Peter wants her to rest. Choo! Watch it, cheetah. This is a hospital. All right. Will you take this? Sure. May I? We're not supposed to feed the animals. Well, I just need something to wash my antihistamine down with, if you don't mind. It seems a shame to waste a milk shake. All right, just... just take it. I don't believe it! Don't you know it is not polite to take somebody else's milk shake? Somebody's who's lying in bed sick. Someone you're trying to impress. You know, you're really... Give me the water! Give me the water! Get out of here! Girl, you got some crazy friends. Yeah, but they're good friends. Now you just give in to it. You deserve the rest. See you. Yeah, yeah. I know, Jack. I know. What do you want me to do, blow it down her goddamn throat? You're such a coward, Jack. You know we can't take any chances. I think your kid's up. I better call you right back. Ok, the candy store is open! Have you been testing the merchandise lately? B.p. She's not ventilating. No, that's not possible. Help me! Aah! Everything will be all right. I love you. Mommy, this truck has been following US. He's been behind US for the longest time. He's probably not following US, sweetheart. Isn't this where Jesse told US to turn off? Yeah. He has been following US. See, honey? He's not following US. I used to play that game when I was a little girl. Mommy! Autumn, fasten your seat belt. Look out! Aah! Autumn, are you ok? Autumn, are you ok? Aah! Damn, lady! What's the matter with you? Who are you? What do you want? Lady, I been trying to get you to stop for the last 10 miles. You're leaking something awful under this car. It could be brake fluid. No. No. Thank you very much. There's a gas station down the road about a mile or 2, just before you get to the beach. Now, I'd get that checked. Ok, I will. Thanks. Ok? Bye. Ok. It's all right. It's all right. So you ran out of brake fluid? I don't want to think what would have happened if he hadn't stopped US. Be careful, sweetie! I will! Tell her don't go in the ocean. Don't go in the ocean. I won't. Don't go near the ocean. Don't go near the ocean. The ocean, the waves. The ocean, the waves... Would you come on? Have fun. Have fun, sweetie. I will. Bye. The broken glass, the jellyfish that washed up on the shore. I know. The pollution, the, oil spills. Heh heh. The ozone layer. The ozone layer. Exactly. Jesse, she hasn't been acting herself. She's been very subdued lately. Kids go through changes. She just saw her mother in the hospital. She nearly got into a car accident. Yeah, I guess. Come here. What's wrong? Jesse, I remember things... From the operation. You were traumatized. There's no telling how the mind will interpret the healing process. I remember you. Me? You remember me? At the end, you always say, "I love you." And I do. Got anything less macabre? The isn't heart surgery, you know. God, help me. Please help me. I don't want to remember this. It's gonna be all right. I don't get it, Alvin. Why did you want US to meet here? It's the last place anyone would ever suspect. Besides, this is where things like this always take place. Yeah. Well, time for US to get to work. Jesus. Is this the same Jack west? Yes. Most definitely. This is the gentleman. Well, who were his partners? This guy, another guy, and a lady. Well, that's pretty helpful, Alvin. "This guy, another guy, and a lady." Their names, Alvin. What are their names? How should I know? Well, what's the name of the corporation? Norman, that was not part of the deal. This is exactly like it's supposed to happen. "Corvidae, incorporated." Perfect. Alvin? Alvin? What are you doing? I've always wanted to break up a fight. Alvin! Yes. The number here is 555-9872. My goodness. I will. Ok. Bye. Do you need anything? Not a thing. Who was that? Sid. I don't want to go back. I know, sweetheart. Isn't it great here? Autumn? You'll protect mommy, won't you? Autumn, sweetie, are you ok? You will protect mommy, won't you? Forever and ever, darling. I'll protect mommy forever and ever. To Ellie and Autumn, two of the loveliest girls on the planet... Forever safe with me. Forever... and ever safe with me. What can you say about Ellie and Autumn other than... Drink up. Going down. Lingerie, David lynch, fellini. I'm sorry. It's all right. It's all right. Please don't let anything bad happen to mommy. I won't. I promise. I gotcha. I gotcha... Yes... Ok, that's the right door. I gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. I... holy shit. What's she doing here? Ok, turn around. Turn around. Come on. Turn... choo! What was that? I don't know. Go check it out. Look out. Hey, get out of the way. No, not now. Dumb fuck. What do you know about the phenomena of consciousness during general anaesthesia? She's repeating entire phrases. I don't want to ask her any more questions. It may trigger pain. She's already having nightmares. She's not just a patient, doctor. I love her. Well, see what you can find out and I'll see you at the hospital on Monday, ok? Thanks. Hi. Hi. Listening? Who were you talking to? What's wrong with me? Ellie, you're a medical phenomena. You had enough drugs in your system to put an elephant to sleep. Yet you had complete recall. Should I be flattered? Well, technically, you were asleep. But you still remember. And I remember more every day. Less than 1% of all surgery patients have any recollection at all. I was talking to a colleague of mine, a Dr. Fisher who's willing to help you with your nightmares. I'm growing fond of them. I like hearing you say "i love you" over and over. Autumn? Autumn, honey, I can see you in the reflection. I can't sleep. Can I cuddle with you guys? Sure. Come here. What's goin' on, kiddo? Hello? Ellie? Norman? What is it? Sid would kill me if he knew that I called, but i... Norman, what's going on? Well, I feel you're in some kind of danger. Danger? I know it sounds crazy, but you gotta trust me on this. Stay away from the hospital. Norman, what is going on? What are you talking about? I'll explain it when I have all the facts. Just stay away from the hospital. Don't tell anyone I called, especially una. Ok. Ok. Bye. I know, I know. It's not for me. It's just a friend. Mommy, are you ok? Yeah, sweetheart, I think it's just the flu or something. Let's see. Autumn, I want you to take your mother inside. I'm gonna go to the car and get my bag. I want to take a look at you. Sid, I got something to show you. Yeah. Where can I meet you? Fine. That's what I was afraid of. What's the matter? There's an abscess where the soft tissue was traumatized. It's probably draining on its own, but it's potentially dangerous. How dangerous? I'm gonna have to take you back to the hospital. The hospital? Sid, sid, not so fast. You'll blow the whole routine. Sid, this is important. Yeah, so is your health. What do you got there? Jack west. That's Ellie's ex. Yeah, I know the guy. And this is una. Yeah, so, what's the big deal? Well, una's wearing a nightie. A nightie? A nightie. And she's in Jack's house. A nightie? Yes. Let me see that. Here. Jesus, she's so fine. Lucky guy. Yeah, but she's supposed to be Ellie's best friend. So? They're divorced, aren't they? Not yet. They're separated. There's a big difference. So, who is this guy? That's Gabe polskavitz. A threesome? He was Ellie's anaesthesiologist. That's disgusting. You don't get it, do you, sid? So I don't know from pinkie. Dr. Peter said that Ellie almost lost her life on the table because something went wrong with the anaesthesia. With the anaesthesia? Yes. It's a conspiracy, sid. They planned the whole thing. 2 men and a woman. What are you talking about? The officers of the corporation. 2 men and a woman. Jack was still married to Ellie when he hit it big. Community property. That's what I'm talking about. This whole thing is about community property. What kind of money could there be? Big money, sid. Big money. It's a computer network information service. Every doctor's office with a p.C. Can hook into it directly, and... and get up-to-date medical data. Why couldn't you think of something like that? Don't start with me, sid. Please. How come Ellie doesn't know about it? Well, the company was brain dead when Jack was conned into buying it. It was an information service with no information. That's where una comes in. She's the link. You see, she learns one thing on Gabe's pillow one night, and tells Jack the next night on his pillow. Jeez. I hope they're using condoms. Hoo hoo hoo. Ha ha. Wait, sid, I'm not finished. Community property, sid. These guys own 33% of half the company. Ellie owns the other half. Good for her. No, not good for her. These guys want it all. If fact, I think that these are the guys who... Well, they tried to kill her on the operating table. Well, what do we do? Well... We need just one more piece of evidence. What? Corporate files. If I can get my hands on them, then we'll be over the top. But then what? Well, then we'll call the cops and the d.A. Be careful, Norman. And don't do anything without calling me first. Sid? I'm so thirsty. You'll like. Please. I don't want to go to the hospital. I know how you feel. I don't like it much myself. Mommy, what's gonna happen to me if something bad happens to you in the hospital? Sweetheart, nothing bad's gonna happen to me... Is it? I don't want to take any chances. Not with this. Not with you. Alvin... listen. You've done this for me a hundred times before. It's all yours, Alvin. Sorry, Norman, look what happened to me last time. Look... It's not my fault that you decided you were John Wayne. Ok. Ok. But this time it's gonna cost you, buster. How much? 250 smackeroos. Done. Yes? You were supposed to be in court 15 minutes ago. I... i know, bernice. What are you doing? Testing. I'm just getting ready for court. Don't worry about it. Is that a microphone? You can go now. I'm gonna get my jacket on. But thank you for reminding me. Hello, Alvin? Are you still there? Yeah. Now, this time I want the switcheroo to take place at the rodeo bar and grill. What are you talking about? I just need you to send me the stuff now. That's no fun. Exactly what do you need? I need you to get into the corporate files of corvidae, inc. And get me the names of the shareholders. I'll have it by 12:30. No, I need you to fax it to me now. I can't fax that stuff until after everyone goes to lunch. Do you want me to go to jail? No, of course not. Ok. After everyone gets to lunch. And next time I will take you to the, rodeo bar and grill. Jesus. What a dope. I don't want to be here. Just trust me. Testing, testing. So, what's in it for you, Gabe? Who the hell are you? I'm the guy who was taking your picture the other night when you were with Jack west and una. You're the idiot. Yeah, I'm that idiot. Really pissed him off. Well, they must be camera shy. Why don't you bug off? How about you, Gabe? Are you camera shy? You know... Look, look, I don't know who you are, I don't know what you're after, but you really picked a bad time. I'll bet. So, why'd you try to kill her, Gabe? Was it for the money? Lots of money? You bastard. I didn't blow 8 years of med school for anybody's money, and I'm not the kind of guy who would take a life because of some stinking payoff. It was a mistake. It was a goddamn mistake. I don't know what else it could have been. If it was a mistake, why were you meeting with Jack west? He was her husband, for Christ sake. I just wanted to explain, to apologize to her. I wanted to save my job. I don't know what went wrong. Jesus Christ, the third partner. Jesus Christ. Sid! Come on. Turn over. Help me. Somebody. Please. Get a gurney over here. Would you mind not smoking in here, please? We're a little touchy today, aren't we? Yeah, well, some of US want to make it to 40. How old are you, Jack? 39. You'll stay healthier drinking this stuff. Well, maybe if you put a little scotch in it. This'll hit the spot. Daddy's little girl? Jesus. Where did you get that? I found it in her room. Are there any more like that? Not for now. But una has a way of making sure they're neither seen nor heard. You're crazy. That's my kid. Kind of funny I'm not in the picture? Do something. Do something. You're so easy, Jack. Fuck... Off. Guess I'm not on your side anymore, kiddo. Please help. Help. He needs help. Would somebody help? Please? Por favor? ¡Rapido! ¡rapido! Looks like they don't speak English, kiddo. It's a heart attack. He's having a heart attack. Telefono nueve-uno-uno. Yeah, what is it? Sid, your aunt lili's on the phone. Aunt lili? Did I forget her birthday? Aunt lili! What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can't understand you. An accident? Cousin Norman? Now, don't you worry none, girl. Dr. Peter's gonna fix you up real good. There's something not right. My baby. Shh. Just relax. Just relax. Autumn! I'm right here, mommy. Call downstairs. Ask for Dr. Fisher. See if Dr. Fisher works down here. Dial zero. Go, honey. Yes, mommy. Hello? I'll call you back. Sid, what are you doing? Don't ask. Can I help you with anything? Suit yourself. Very good, Norman. What? That's impossible. What's this for? It's your pre-op medication. Pre-op? Surgery. No. No. Now, listen. Calm down, girl. You're in good hands here. Stop it. Dr. Peter's orders. I want to speak to Dr. Peter. He said they've never heard of Dr. Fisher. Now, listen, girl. There's nothing to worry about here. Just go with it. Mommy! Mommy! Sleep well. "The story of the dove, by Autumn west, second grade." Put the tube in. I feel you're in some kind of danger. Everything will be all right. I love you. She's desaturating. Going down, lingerie, David lynch, fellini. Close your eyes and fall asleep. Can I have some? Sleep well. Aah! Could be brake fluid. She's not just a patient, doctor. I love her. Sweetie, I can see you in the reflection. Speaking to a colleague of mine, Dr. Fisher. Hey said they've never heard of Dr. Fisher. Aah! No! You see, doctor? I love you. Where's your mother? They took her to have an operation. You're coming with me, girl. No! Get away! What's going on here? Hi. I've been taking care of her and I'd like her to come with me. I don't want to go with you. I want to wait here for mommy. Child, has this lady been taking care of you? Ellie? Ellie, we're going to operate. Everything will be all right. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Has she been taking care of you? Then I think you gotta go with her. You know, a hospital really isn't a healthy place for a child. Ain't it the truth. Don't tell anyone I called... Cheers. Especially una. Come with una, sweetheart. It's ok. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. No. I don't want to go with you. Come on. I don't want to go with you. Thank you. Ok. Jesse and I aren't seeing each other anymore. I love you. I love you, too. Just relax. Relax. What's the matter with her? 1% of isoflora. Jesse, something's not right. 1% isoflora now. Stay away from the hospital. Please. Just relax. Just... can you breathe for me? Can you breathe for me, sweetheart? Just breathe. Can you just do this one thing for me, please? Mommy, what's gonna happen to me if something bad happens to you in the hospital? Come on. Breathe for me. "She kept on walking around in circles. She had been betrayed." Unh! Get the orderlies in here. Don't fight her out of this. Are you all right? Somebody stop her! No! God! Security to O.R. one... Let me go! Open up! Just stand still! Aah! You're gonna pay attention to me. You've been nothing but trouble since the first day I met you. You're gonna start listening to me now, aren't you? No! Autumn! Mommy! Autumn! Mommy! Mommy, she's taking me! See ya, kiddo. Let me help you up. No! Mommy! Aah! Where do you think you're going? Mommy? Over here. This way. Mommy, are you ok? Over here. "She was very beautiful, "and gentle. I asked my mom why she wasn't afraid, "and she said the dove knew she was safe with me. "So the dove built her nest, had her baby, "and I kept them safe. "But one day, 3 gigantic crows flew over the nest. "They circled above the mother dove and her baby, "but the mother dove stood her ground. "She fought with courage to protect her baby. "And this time, it was different. "The crows lost, the mother dove won. "And she and her baby were safe. "Crows don't fly over that house anymore because they know it's not right to hurt a dove."
