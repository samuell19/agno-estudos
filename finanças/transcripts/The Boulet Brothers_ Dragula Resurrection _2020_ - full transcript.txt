- No. Weak. Stupid. Awful. Interesting. - Playtime's over. Get this mess cleaned up and get dressed. - Oh, too bad. - The winner of Dragula will receive a grand prize of $20,000. Courtesy of us. And will compete on the next season for the title of Dragula, the World's Next Drag Supermonster. - Happy Halloween, uglies. I'm sure you're all dying to know why we invited you here. So we're going to get right to it. Each of you competed on a previous season of "Dragula" and each of you failed miserably. - And as you all know, in this competition, you either win or die. And well, we all know how that turned out for you. You tried your best to snatch the crown. And unfortunately, all you ended up winning was an early grave and a one-way ticket to hell. - Regardless, that was in the past and we brought you here tonight to discuss the future. You see, of all the monsters who competed and fell, we feel that the seven of you showed great promise. And tonight, we're giving you a second chance to prove your worth and return to the land of the living. - You are here to compete in a grand Halloween showcase. You will prove your skills at the art of drag, filth, horror, and glamour by creating three looks and performances, which you will present in three distinct floor shows. - You'll be judged on your creativity, your skills at costume design and creation, your makeup skills, and your ability to perform. You will also be scored on your ingenuity and the freshness of your overall vision for each challenge. - Whoever achieves the highest score will win the showcase and will be risen from the grave. You will return to the land of the living and compete again as a cast member of the upcoming "Boulet Brothers' Dragula" season four. - And that's not all. The winner of the Halloween competition will also win $20,000 in cold, hard cash. Outside of your looks and performances, we wanna see you open up. We're looking for a monster with a fresh perspective. Someone who has something to say, someone who's not afraid to show us who they are and is truly ready to come back to the competition and slay. - With that out of the way, it's time to meet your fellow competitors. Starting off the competition are two monsters all the way back from season one, Loris and Frankie Doom. Up next are three tumultuous terrors from season two, Kendra Onixxx, Dahli, and Victoria Black. And last but not least, we have some fresh meat who just got done slaying season three, Saint and Priscilla Chambers. - Welcome back, darlings. Now let's talk about your challenges. We have chosen one legacy challenge from each season of the "Boulet Brothers' Dragula." From season one, we have the witch challenge. You'll need to design and create an original look based on the theme of the witch. - Hell yeah. - For your second challenge, you'll need to design and create a spectacular spectral look based on the ghost theme from season two. And your final challenge, it's inspired by one of our favorites from season three, the vampire challenge. For this challenge, you will not only have to create an incredible vampiric look, but you must also perform. You will choreograph and execute a lip-sync performance to Kim Petras' haunting serenade "In the Next Life." - Amazing. - Oh, and there is one last little thing. We will not be bringing you back to the mansion to compete against one another this time around. - Oh. - You see, instead of you coming to us- - Oh no. - We're going to come to you. That's right, my cunty little cadavers. We're going to be sending our skeleton camera crews directly to your homes. We're going to rip off your shells and see what makes you tick on the inside. - We're going to film you at your jobs, interrogate your friends and lovers, and look under those filthy beds to see what you're really made of. - You have one week to design your looks and prepare your shows. The competition starts now. - Hi, I'm Kendra Onixxx from season two and I live in Moreno Valley. I'm going to win because I feel like I have grown the most. I'd describe Kendra's drag as very naked, very bloody, very high energy. I'll be dripping in blood, do cartwheels, splits, butt ass naked, pussy on the ground. That's me. Kendra, season two, was like, meow, meow, meow cute around the house. But this is like Kendra 2.0, bitch. Like I'm ready to show you guys what I have. - I'm Victoria Elizabeth Black from season two of "Dragula." And I live in Orlando, Florida. When I got the call to be on the special, I was flabbergasted, especially finding out that it's a Halloween special, like, come on, that is literally my shit. I'm going to win this because I am so much more talented than any of those other girls. Like there are things that I'm gonna pull out of the bag that they would never even think to do. - Well, hey, y'all, your favorite country sister-cousin is back, Priscilla Chambers, and I was on "Dragula" season three. I know I look a little different. I've currently started transitioning, which basically means that I've upgraded to a double wide. Halloween is my favorite holiday. I went trick or treating until I was 17 years old. And then I had to stop because I would get there and they would give me one piece of candy or just close the door. - I'm Loris, I'm from season one of "Dragula" and I live in Hollywood, California. I wanna be famous. I feel like, honestly, season two and three had it so easy compared to what we had to go through on season one. The essence of a truly great "Dragula" contestant is that pure energy of fuck you, I'm that bitch. I am that bitch and I know that I'm that bitch. - Loris can never be that bitch and will never be that bitch. - Hi, I'm Frankie Doom. I'm from West Covina, California, and I was on season one of "The Boulet Brothers' Dragula". If I had to describe my drag character, I would say I'm like a big mix of Ursula the Sea Witch, Elvira, Christina Aguilera, and Miss Piggy. - I think I can beat Frankie Doom. - Oh, I can beat Frankie Doom. Anyone in this competition probably could beat Frankie Doom. - Victoria, who, what'd she say? Did she say anything in the show? I can take her, I'm bigger. - I'm Saint, I competed on "Dragula" season three, and I'm from Acworth, Georgia. Being on "Dragula" absolutely made my drag stronger. I've traveled the world, I've sold out shows. I'm not anywhere near the queen I was back then. I was looking at a photo of myself and I was like, gosh, I wish I could redo "Dragula" season three all over again. I wish I could go back. I wish I could show people what I was made of. And here we are. - I'm Dahli. I am from Phoenix, Arizona. I was a contestant on season two of "Dragula." Well, I guess last time I got sent home too early, and this time is a little different 'cause I'm already home, so that's nice. My time on season two was a fun experience. However, my vision was clouded by so much anxiety. I definitely regret giving up and not showing more of myself. I'm going into this with a mindset that I am fucking untouchable and I can't be duplicated. - Oh my God. I love Dahli. We exchanged nudes one time. I was very happy with what I got. - Ooh, bae. I love St. Lucia. Yeah. I have lots of feelings about that one and all of them are very good and tingly. Thank you. - Happy Halloween. - When I got the call to be on this competition, to do this, it was kind of incredible. Honestly, I feel that I could win this. I wanna come back and compete because I feel like now that I'm in a different place in my life, I've grown so much as a performer, I've come such a long way, I feel like I want to be able to take another chance to fuck shit it up again and hopefully make it to the end. I mean, I hope to win, but if I don't, there's always a top three again. I've been in love with drag since I was a little kid. I remember having cable. I was an only child. Well, I have a sister, but- I used to stay up late and watch movies and cartoons, and random things. I remember I came across Dawn Davenport. My favorite, I wanted to be Dawn Davenport. I just wanted to be a monster woman. That's what got me started. Growing up, my occupation that my parents asked what's your dream, what's your goal, what's your aspiration? It was to be famous, to be a star. I never knew it was gonna be dressing up in drag, but I'm really glad it is. I'm really happy with how it turned out, but it took me a while to actually get the balls to do it. My boyfriend actually told me, "Well, stop fucking talking about it and fucking do it, or I don't wanna hear it." So I picked up a wig, I picked up a corset, and went out there and looked a big mess. My family was not okay with it. When it came to drag, they really, they didn't get it. You know, we're Mexican, everyone thinks you're gonna be this like butch kid and have a whole bunch of kids and you know, I'm not that. - I actually enjoy Frankie. And I think he's a fucking powerhouse of a tank. Frankie, he has his niche and I haven't ever seen her rise up out of it. So if she can do that, she could probably crush some shit. She's not gonna touch this, but she could crush it. - So, one night I was going to a Boulet Brother pageant. And my dad walked up to me in the restroom and said, "Why do you do this? You're not even pretty. You look gross. Like, I don't get it." So that night, I left, I fucked it up. I won that and I came home and I told my dad that night, "Well, your ugly son is a fucking pageant winner. I'm a fucking beauty queen." And I came with my fucking check, "Here's my money, here's my flowers, and here's my crown." And that kind of was the beginning of like just being more confident in myself and kind of growing from there. And that's always what I wanted to be. I feel like Frankie's very powerful because she's a stunning woman with a penis. So we're at Knott's Berry Farm. So this is one of my jobs and I'm a scare actor. How long can you hold your breath? I chase people around with an ax as a fish boy. I love scaring people, I love to freak people out, chase them, pretend I'm gonna kill them. I went up to this guest. I jumped right in front of her, and I screamed in her face and I swung my weapon, and she freaked out so hard that she liter-literally uppercutted me in the nose and the nose ripped off my mask. So I mean, it was amazing. It's cool that I scared someone so bad that they beat me up, but I had to haul ass to hot-glue that shit back on so I can come back and keep scaring. You never stop scaring. I was really looking forward to coming back this year and scaring again, but due to COVID, it just seems like we're not gonna have a Halloween this year, and it really sucks. It's really crappy that COVID kind of shut everything down. - Please leave a message. - Hey, St. Lucia, I heard you're on the show with me. I can't wait to see that body. Mm. I hope we get to be close to each other. It's gonna be hot. - I'm a whore, so I'm okay with this. - So the first challenge is the witch. So I wanted to bring one of my favorite witches to life, the Grand High Witch from the movie "The Witches." I really didn't want to give you guys the same thing I gave you season one, which was this like naked, trashy, swamp witch. I wanted to take it up a notch and kind of go the complete opposite and show you how much I've changed, and, you know, glam it up a little bit. So I wanted to kind of really bring that cape out. 'Cause the cape is the showstopper. It's huge. It's obnoxious in the cover, it's insane. So, so much fucking fabric went into making this. I think it's like 20 yards. There's like 10 of purple, 10 of black. And let's hope it holds up. She also has a human face that she, in the scene, like rips away to reveal her monster face. So I kinda wanna make a little mini Frankie moment to kind of tear away for that. And this is a foam latex prosthetic. So far, she has the base and she has some stuff going on. It's gonna get a lot better, but I'm not gonna give it all away yet. So here's your glimpse, that's it, expect much more. So basically this is it. This is the witch. All you guys can stay home. Y'all can just figure shit out because who's better than the Grand High Witch? And I'm the Grand High Witch. - So our first challenge is going to be a witch and I really wanted to go back to my country roots. You know, I figured that going into this, everyone, they're gonna go with the cliche route, you know, nose, chin, just what you would think of. So I decided to do a swamp witch. And it's true to me, if Priscilla was a witch, she'd be this nasty, dirty Appalachian witch. So I was thinking, all right, this is the perfect opportunity to do taxidermy. So I ordered a taxidermy alligator head. The reason I do taxidermy is because I think it's very important to find the beauty in death. So I want to utilize every part of this animal that I got. So I'm currently trying to make this a jaw fascinator. So it'll be very interesting trying to like drill another hole in this and trying to get it hooked up and to stay because I have stretched ears and I know this shit's gonna pull, but you know, "Dragula," you gotta have some pain. Right, whenever I got back from filming season three, I began the journey in transitioning and been on hormones about a year and four months now. Drag was a very, very good outlet for me. There would be no drag community without trans entertainers. There just wouldn't be. And I think the world needs to know that trans entertainers exist and we're not going anywhere. - I think Priscilla is amazing. I love that she came out after and she's living her fucking truth, like be who you are and that's the whole, that's the whole journey, right? That's the whole thing about being an artist and living your life. It's being who the fuck you are authentically. And I think it's great that she's doing that. - I'm really happy for Priscilla and the journey that she's on. I'm so happy she finally like can be herself and show everyone like the true bitch she is. I love her. - When I was 17, I decided to come out as trans. You know, I went back and forth of like, how can I do drag and, you know, be a trans person? Like I just had it in my mind that I couldn't do both. And I realized that none of that shit matters. I know a lot of like trans people are called drag performers sometimes, and that's not it at all. And so there can kind of cause a little bit of um.. Chaos in the community. They don't know because they've never been taught any better because we don't have that representation. I think it's very important for the media to showcase us in a better light. That's not just like, we're playing the villains, we're a man dressing up as a woman or like we're getting murdered. That's literally all the representation you see as trans people. I am just a person doing drag. Being trans has nothing to do with me being a drag queen. That's just how I choose to present myself to the world. Me out of drag is who I am on the daily. Drag is my art. And it's literally just like theater. The thing is, is that you have to accept that drag is changing. If you cannot change with the times, you will get lost in history, that's it. - So, my witch bitch is going to be very fetish, inspired leather and latex bondage. I feel like for this one, I'm taking a much more classical approach. I'm going for something that's instantly recognizable. That's iconic rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. I think where I fell short on my season was being able to really hit the challenge nail on the head. I started working with latex around the time we finished season one. Latex cannot be sewed like a regular material. If you sew it, it will pop, you can't smoke any cigarettes if you're wearing latex, it can't be exposed in the sun for too long. So it's pretty intense. My inspiration for my witch is my mom. She's a Wiccan and a witch herself. She's the person who taught me freedom. This is a tribute to being raised right and it's a tribute to loving yourself. - For the first look is a witch and I went with like more of a voodoo witch doctor, kind of very African queen, necromancing sort of witch. I'm going for realism. Like you will see this bitch in Africa, ripping people's hearts out, delivering babies, chopping they mother fucking head off and cursing bitches. That's what I'm going for. Let's hope it looks good, girl. No, she does, she does, she does. So I wanted to keep it very authentic to Africa. So this, I got an Impala skull and now I'm just aging it with eyeshadow. I'm using black, grays, and browns just to make it look older. So it's not like super duper new. It was very important for me to go with the African route because I always feel that I'm unapologetically black. So I just wanna represent that in my drag. - I would describe my witch as an adaptation of the surrounding environment, a witch that derives from, you know, the desert. So this is for my witch concept. I'm a lover of head pieces. It's my favorite thing in the world. So basically the entire structure of this is just made from armature wire. It's thin enough to be pliable. I enjoy working this way instead of just sewing something because there's a lot more danger to this. I can't tell you how many times I've stabbed myself under the fingernail with this wire. You know, I'm very hands on when I'm creating. So like having something that I can like instantly bend and shape and mold in front of me, it's stimulates my mind. This started coming along as like a very spider-esque kind of feel. So I decided to give her some little fangs in the front and those are just thumbnails. So sorry to ruin the illusion but they're just thumbnails. - This year has been a very trying on black people just generally learning more about like my personal culture and things like that. I really wanted to bring representation like that to "Dragula." So I'm gonna be doing an African moonbather. So I decided to take it more of a African approach. I use a lot of moths and flowers in my existing work. So I also wanted to bring those as well into this piece. So I decided to do custom moths that have posable limbs and body parts. This headpiece is just literally a piece of wire that I decided to bend to fit. And I just glued flowers onto it and attached the crystals. I feel like a lot of people feel like when you do drag, you have to spend a whole lot of money. But I think some of the best drag is made from things you can get at like a dollar store. - So my witch is very like bog witch-inspired, like in the woods, she likes to be topless. So she just wears her little skirt with all her bones and all the like twine tied around her. So in this foam latex piece, I would go about sculpting it on a mannequin that is very similar to my body structure. And then I would go ahead and mold it somewhat like this. And it would go in an oven for a few hours. And the next day I would take it out, pull it out and start painting it, like so. First I'm gonna go in with like a purple because I wanna have like a really gross, like purple-y undertexture, but I still wanna have a little life. So I'm going in with more of a rosy purple color that I can feel a little alive. I plan on doing these little finger extensions, as you see, this is some casts of my finger and I'm just gonna wear these all over so I can have a nice extension, I love that. So I have the whole outfit and everything for the witch, but I wanted to do an extension to her and I'm gonna actually build a set for her and really show how she would live and just really give her the atmosphere that she deserves. I just have so much like positive energy coming from this experience already. I feel like this is mine, completely. - Be ready. Don't underestimate me because I went home third, just be ready. - I'm Frankie fucking Doom. I got this. - Witch please. - I'm that witch, bitch. - What? - I'm that witch, bitch. - This bitch is crazy. - I just did my witch, I feel really good. I served a very ethereal creature. It feels great to be back on camera. It feels great to show what I've made of again. It feels great for the viewers to see how much I've improved. Got a lot more to show and I'm ready. - Oh my God, I just had to climb through a fucking little hole. I'm a fat bitch. I can't do that. And I had to walk my ass up in these chanclas. - So we just finished the witch. I froze my ass off getting into that cold ass water. It was cold as shit, but we got it done and I'm ready for the next challenge. - All right, the witch is back, y'all. I just got done filming my witch floor show and it was everything that I dreamed it would be. These bitches really thought that they were gonna pack fiercer looks and that they were gonna outperform me? Oh honey, not tonight. I wanna be famous. My brother and I used to always do horrible pranks on each other on Halloween. One year, he runs up behind me and put the paper bag over my head, and I fell down the stairs, and I stabbed out my tooth. The next year, I also proceeded to push him in an empty pool and he cracked his skull, which I'm not saying I did that on purpose, but watch out, bitches. - Those were pranks? - I think the opportunity to compete on season four would be so incredible because I'm at a point in my life right now where I'm ready to take on a huge challenge like that. I'm ready to put in the work. I'm not concerned that I'm going to be competing with contestants who made it to the top three or the top two, because I think that I should have been in the top three in my season. On season one, the Boulet Brothers asked the question, "Which one of your fellow competitors should go home and why?" And all of my sisters listed me as the weakest link. That was the moment for me, where I for the first time realized that none of these people liked me. Because looking back on that challenge, I feel like I kind of served it. When you show up with a package that's better than expected, people tend to get a little pissed off. I don't think that that was my time to be eliminated. I should've truly stood up for myself. I should have said, no, fuck you, guys. And showed that real fight to survive and to stay. I just felt like lots of people didn't like me because I haven't figured out how to present myself to them yet. People do misinterpret my confidence for bitchiness. And I'm okay with that. I don't have a problem with being a bitch, but that doesn't mean that people have not been jealous or had negative opinions about me. I just think that that comes from a different place rather than them not liking my drag. - Do I feel like she's misunderstood? No. I just think that, you know, I love a person who thinks they're the shit and knows they're the shit, but it's like, you don't have to be annoying about it. - She's actually a really cool fucking person. She just doesn't speak how she should sometimes. Or doesn't read how it should. I would just give her as advice to be real, be cool, and just be yourself. Talk to people like you would anybody else. - I feel much more confident now and I would have no problem telling anyone who didn't like my drag that they could go fuck themselves. 'Cause I'm that bitch. You can be a bitch as long as you're that bitch. So, my current partner is James, also known as Honey Davenport, and he is a beautiful, lovely drag queen. We have a great relationship together and we found each other during this quarantine time. The quarantine just kind of brought us closer together. It cut out a lot of distractions that we had in our lives, like touring and performing, allowed us to really find each other. We found something really, really special. I love that James can always make me smile regardless of how terrible my day is. But also he puts me in my place. He lets me know when something I say is off base, he'll definitely check me. And I think that's important for me to have a partner that does that because I'm rowdy as hell sometimes. So the second floor show is the ghost floor show. And my ghost is a tribute to anyone who has ever suffered from suicidal thoughts. My ghost look is a tribute to my friend Zach and I wanted to make this a tribute to people who struggle with those feelings of self-doubt and of wanting to hurt yourself. So this look is presented in a half and half format. The one half is the woman, the victim who has been plagued by these thoughts and these suicidal tendencies. And the other is the energy personified, the demon, the darkness that pushed her to that point. So my half and half ghost costume is made entirely out of latex. One half is a male fit and one half is a female fit, which was really difficult to pull off. I have the hair split down the middle, the really dramatic sleeve here, and the men's suit silhouette. And then the women's kind of Victorian silhouette going here with two different shoes as well. So I might be walking around more like a pirate than a ghost, but we'll see. - I need to remain anonymous because I can't let anybody know this, okay. She's my friend and I don't wanna hurt her feelings, but I keep seeing all this stuff and I need everyone to know that Loris is 100% not that bitch. She ain't, she's just not, shit. - I was in the Army for 11 years. A week after we filmed the second season, my contract for the military was up and I did not wanna reenlist. Mentally, I do feel like the military prepared me to be on "Dragula" because once again, I went through "Dragula" with my leg broken. You know what I mean? I went to "Dragula" with my leg broken, still in six-inch heels. Bitches are complaining about standing up. I didn't say one motherfucking thing because I am disciplined to do what I need to do to get what I want. And I do believe that it's a mix of my parents and the military that brought me up that way. My parents still do not know I do drag. They're really into church and stuff. So it's just like, it's two different lives. Praise the Lord. My mom has never seen me in drag. She has never found a wig, she's never found a dress, she's never found heels, no. The only thing she's found was my makeup kit, but they've always thought it was like for stage. 'Cause I've always been in drama. I've always been in plays. It is for stage, but for me. I'm very, very sad that she's never seen me perform. But I'm sure she will. She won't like it at first because of all her little church friends always gossiping, but I feel like she'll secretly like it. But at the end of the day, I'm a grown ass man. I stand on my own two feet, I make my own money. So if she doesn't wanna be a part of that side of my life, then that's on her. And the lies keep coming in. After I did "Dragula", I got a lot of queer artists, drag queens of color to message me and ask me like, how did you do it? How did you keep going? And I just told them, you have to have a thick skin first and foremost, you have to have an even thicker skin being a black drag queen wanting to do this genre of drag. People will always try to put you in a box. They'll be like, okay, this is the black girl. So she's most likely gonna do this. And I say to them, fuck you. If I wanna go out there and be butt ass naked covered in blood, do some in this moment, some Marilyn Manson, that's what I'm gonna do. And I can bet you I'll make more money than you do. So in November of 2019, I got in a really, really bad fire accident. I was in the middle of a performance. I'm holding the torch and I rushed to grab the accelerant. Man, I don't wanna cry. And oh my God, oh my God. And I blew it out and I just got burned up. It was the scariest moment of my whole life. It was just simple fact that like accepting that you are gonna die in that moment was just so scary. Can I have a minute? - Yeah. Yeah, that's okay. Totally fine. - So the only thing I could really, really see as I was performing was flames because my lashes were on fire. I've seen the video of me getting burnt up and all I see is like, people like watching me run around on fire and it's like, nobody wanted to help me. The only person, two people that helped me, was my drag daughter and another friend that was there. He poured a beer in my face. Like if he didn't do that, who knows, you know, like I couldn't be sitting here today, but I thank God that I am. I just really thank God that I'm alive, you know. - What happened to Kendra is, I believe, probably the worst thing that can happen to a person that puts their face forward as their job. That was heartbreaking to see. But the healing is incredible. It's like nothing ever fucking happened. She looks great and she's back on stage killing it. I hope she doesn't play with fire anymore. - I am 100% recovered. Even the doctors were amazed at how fast it happened and when you're a fire spinner, breather, whatever, it's not if you're gonna get burned, it's when you're gonna get burned. And I just so happened to get burned really fucking bad. - I would love Kendra to do fire again. I think that like you should take all of your, no matter what it is, you should take the thing that scares you the most and fucking put it full-force. And if you don't, then you shouldn't win this competition. - Yeah, if I were a Kendra, I'd think twice about doing fire again. 'Cause that was scary, bitch. I don't know if I could go back to that. That was some... - Even though I did get burned, I actually did a whole look based around the accident, which is my ghost look. So I will be doing fire during that one. I definitely wanna prove to people that I knew what I was doing. Not that, oh, that's just some girl that's trying to do something edgy. I know what I'm doing and I do it well. Watch me get burned again. So the second challenge of the competition is a ghost look. The symbolism behind my ghost is that I wanted to showcase that although I was burned that fire didn't kill me, bitch, you can't burn a real witch. So this is like 40 yards of tulle and crinoline sewed, hand-stitched on a hoop skirt. And what I did was I put a lot of the UV reactive paint on it, like I splashed it around. So my whole body is gonna be covered in the same paint that's on the dress. So when the UV lights hits it, the black sorta disappears, that's why it's tulle and crinoline. And my body is just gonna be shown and it's gonna look like I'm floating. When they think about Kendra, they think about Kendra, the girl that does fire, that's me. - So our second challenge is presenting a ghost look, which I'm stoked about because I don't know a fucking thing about the paranormal, but I am going to be the ghostiest ghost ghost ghost that you've ever seen. I decided to take a natural-looking approach in the form of a tree this time. I like to take a different approach to horror. I use a lot of inspiration from inanimate and lesser common inspirations, things that we wouldn't necessarily deem as frightening or scary. I like to take them and apply them in different ways that kind of make people think, getting in someone's head, and playing on a fear that they may have not had before, and leaving them with this disturbing imagery. I think that that is a longterm effective in fear and horror. The materials I used for this was a lot of drapery fabric, like tons of it. The actual dress itself when it's spread out pretty much covers my entire living room. So this is completely distressed all the way through every layer, it's a fucking mess. And I always start from the bottom, work my way to the top. 'Cause the bottom naturally when it comes to distressing, the bottom's always gonna be way more tattered and ruined than the rest of it. The only thing I can say about using a box cutter to drag it across this kind of fabric is it catches. So it creates several little holes. But instead of getting one big one, which is, you know, you kind of, once you get too big of a hole, you can't go back, you know what I mean? So what I did here is I started making all the tiny little holes and then I took my fingers and I stuck them in there and just started stretching them and tearing them open. And I actually cut my finger with the fabric. I was working with a seam ripper and a box cutter and somehow managed to cut myself open with the fabric itself. It was like being sliced with a piano wire, it was very uncomfortable. I kinda named myself after Salvador Dali, like a legendary artist, knowing good and goddamn well that I would never be able to fill those shoes, that did not stop me from trying. But I think for me, drag is what I want to leave behind. Like the same way that artists before me have is to leave behind shoes that are too big to fill for someone else to, I guess, name themselves after. And then like, you're never gonna like make it to this but it won't stop you from trying. So it's like a constant evolution and this inspiration of just pushing forward and becoming better and improving yourself. You can take away all the materialistic things and the notoriety and really just leaving a fucking legend behind and to inspire other people to do the same. That's what I wanna do. My time on season two was really fun. I mean, it was really odd to watch, watching someone do so well for like the first couple of episodes. And then I felt super intimidated by just about everybody. My level of anxiety and inhibition was just completely blurring what was presently in front of me. I felt like I was just crushed completely under pressure because I was still in the middle of building my character as a person, not even as a drag persona, but as me. I feel like if I was to give my 100% and I had failed, I don't know that I was in the head space to bounce back from that. So basically when it came time for elimination, I shut down completely. And I just, I gave up and was like, this is as far as I can go and I just accepted it. And I was like, I just stood there on the beach and let that tidal wave hit me. - I don't know why someone would throw an extermination. I don't know why she would not be as into it. I mean, it seemed like she didn't really care if she went home or not. - Dahli definitely gave up season two and I wish you would've did it episode three. And then I would've stayed. - I'm not gonna fault anybody for being in that head space especially being in that head space before myself, - When we give up, we are leaving on our own merit. We might be disappointing other people, but we're not disappointing ourselves entirely in that moment because that's the only thing we can control. We can take ourselves away from a situation. And that's, I mean, that's what happened with me. Ultimately, I do regret leaving. I used to think about it all the time, like regularly, like every time you're just like at home and you open a bottle of wine by yourself and you think about everything you've ever regretted in your life. That's always the first thing that came up. I know that I could have went a lot further. I felt like I could have won looking back on it now. I should have stayed, but I didn't. I am extremely excited for people to see who Dahli has became. It's definitely a vast difference and a huge evolution. I've grown a lot as a person underneath my makeup and that's helped quite a bit. I was very vocal during the Black Lives Matter movement that's still happening. I'm glad that there was this big push for the movement in the past couple of months. 'Cause it's really, I mean, I believe that it's gonna help in the long run. It will change the future, especially for the younger generation. I was raised where the entire white side of my family was extremely racist. My own grandfather used to call me like the "N-word" all the time when I was a kid, like just really fuck shit. 'Cause I'm of mixed race and my mom is white and I've never met my dad. I know that I have my own privilege of being like white passing 'cause I have a lighter skin tone. I just think a lot of people just see skin color and immediately just jumped to that. I think just being goth for so long and just hiding in the daylight and all that mess, kind of just washed me out for awhile. I think the alternative scene has their own war on race that a lot of people don't address at all. It's very common that people of color that are into the alternative scene aren't looked at the same way because as alternative people, as like, you know, goth, punk, we've always kind of associated beauty with being pale or light skin and having certain features, and these features that they have made up in their own mind and pushed forward as like the surface vibe for everyone. I mean, that's not gonna be possible for a dark skin person. So they're automatically like kind of ostracized in most of these alternative groups. 'Cause they're like, oh, you can't be black and goth. That's a white person thing. And it ain't though. - As for the witch, I made a set. So I decided for the ghosts, they need the same thing. So I decided to build a whole morgue in my garage. So get ready for that, you guys, I came up with this amazing idea to extend the story from season two and Dr. Vicky, As you know, I did a little necrophilia on season two with a corpse on stage. So basically I wanted a turn around the role and be the victim and the corpse that she had been torturing this whole time. So today I did a full sculpt on a body form, very similar to mine, using a lot of like human references from real autopsies. From that point, I took it out from the mold and got it ready for casting. So I'm going to stipple in some latex in here, so you could see how I do that. And from that point, I'm going to throw it in the oven and we're going to cast our piece. My skillset from season two to now, I would say, like really is just the finessing of my craft and being really comfortable in my skin now. When I was on season two, I didn't know at the time, but apparently I have an acute version of Asperger's that my parents failed to tell me years ago. So I'm like, wow, it makes so much sense now why I was so socially awkward. I realized so much from season two and all of my issues, like being social with the girls and just like talking more and having more of a personality, it really like hindered me, I feel like. Realizing that now, I was like, wow, I could have really like, changed that by even just telling you guys that was what was going on instead of just seeming like this very quiet girl in the corner. And just like in her head with loud thoughts that you just don't know what she's thinking. So I think it's changed a lot. - For the ghost, my inspiration was La Llorona. As a Mexican kid growing up, my grandma used to always tell all my cousins and like family that if you're a piece of shit, this like monster was gonna come get you. Or that La Llorona was gonna come take you to the water and kill you or whatnot for being a bad kid. Clearly it never worked on me and she used to get mad at me for not being afraid of it, like, where's that bitch at? Let me see her. I wanna see her. Mixing my culture into my drag is something that I just recently got more into. There's a lot of scary shit in my heritage. So I like to look it up and kind of feed it into my art now. It's my theme. I hate children. They're not for me. So we had an old wedding dress from a thrift store and we were able to cut it apart and kind of Frankenstein stuff together to get it to work. And it's actually inspired by Kim Kardashian from the Met Gala. It's actually how I want it to look, it looks perfect. It looks gross, it looks messy, it looks dirty, but it's still really glamorous. A beautiful woman died and comes and takes your children. There's more secrets to it, but I'm not gonna give it all away. I don't want you all looking like me. - So for our next challenge, it is gonna be inspired by season two's runway. And it's going to be a ghost. Boo. My inspiration for the ghost is to be a sex worker. This isn't just about me. You know, I am portraying a sex worker, but this is for all of those women, especially the women of color, who are being murdered. And one thing that people need to know is that black lives matter, but that also includes trans black lives. So this whole look is gonna be dedicated to all of my fallen trans sisters of color. So for the makeup, I'm definitely gonna do gray and white, but it's gonna be kind of like beaten up, so very smoky. And then I was like, you know what? Let's pay tribute to all of the fantastic trans icons of the '70s and '80s. So I decided to go with more of like an '80s vibe. And if I can get this down and nail this and the vision that's in my head, if I can portray that to y'all, I know I've got this entire competition in the bag. - My ghost look is inspired by a classic sheet ghost. There's things that are very important for me to keep with this. One of the more important things was the silhouette, the classic trick-or-treaters silhouette, I'm just cutting the eyes out of the sheet. That was a big inspiration for this. So the premise behind this look is during Halloween, the folk tale is that the veil between the underworld and our world is thin. So I took - I decided to take that premise of kids dressing up like monsters to hide from the monsters. And I'm a monster dressed up as a kid. I chose to take the idea of ghost, the simplicity of a ghost, like the children's ghost of having just a sheet and throwing it over your head. But I also wanted to elevate it in ways, like making sure that I've paid a lot of attention to different textures and movements. The cat suit is actually velvet and the way velvet hits like, the moonlight, I thought would be very interesting. This concept's a little simple, but if they get what I'm doing, I'm definitely gonna win this challenge. - I'm doing fire again tonight. And I just know that I can't mess it up. It has to be perfect. And there's no other option.. - I guess I just say that I'm just going into it confidently and I just feel untouchable. - My message to the other contestants is simply this. Be afraid. Be very afraid. - I just finished the ghost. Bitch, when I went out there, I was fucking loving it. I was doing all kinds of slut '80s moves. I mean, I'm pretty sure you can see my entire asshole during the entire thing. - My ghost, overall, I feel was good. I mean, I had a moment where I was like, this is fucking stupid, so the anxiety was there, but you use your anxiety to fuel your performance. - Oh my God, I felt so good about the ghost challenge. I really like got my life upside down, like crab walking and the worms crawling on me. It just felt so right. I felt like I could have been in the ground and just dead. I felt my ghostly oats. - Oh, I think the floor show went really well. I thoroughly enjoyed everything that I could see from my angle. - I just did my ghost floor show. I would like to see who can top this look. Season three Saint would have been more scared of what the other competitors were doing, but right now, I'm just focused on what I'm doing. I'm bringing some of the best looks that I've ever produced. And that's that on that, bitch. - I've always loved Halloween. Especially growing up as a kid, I always had all the Halloween costumes I could ever ask for. I had a grandfather that used to own a party store and he had his garage full of all the old props and masks and things from his store. From that point, I wanted my own haunted house. My parents had like this upstairs loft area. So I completely redid it and started building pretty much my own haunt. I used to guide the people through the haunt with a flashlight and I would be in full like character the whole time. And I'd be like giving them a whole show. Going forward a few years, when I figured out drag, that characterization, I wanted to bring in to that persona so I could do these crazy characters anytime I wanted. And it doesn't have to be just for Halloween or the haunted houses. Now I'm actually working for a third party. We work on many theme parks around Orlando and really it's been the best job of my life. Honestly, it's one of my biggest goals that I never thought I would be doing, to say that I got to work on all the haunted attractions in the city I live in, oh my God, what a dream. It was unreal that I was able to make the money I did with something I loved so much. When I first found out about "Dragula," I was sitting in bed with my fiance and we saw the first preview and we like shit our pants. We were like, we have to get on this. Finally being able to be on the show was a dream. Opulence has been my biggest supporter from the get go. Opulence, if you didn't know, is actually my fiance. His name is Rock. We've been together for almost six years now. It's, time has flown by, but I couldn't do anything without him. He's the love of my life. Like he has wanted me to compete in this competition from the moment we saw that preview of the Boulets. And he couldn't be more proud of me and I love him so much. My experience on "Dragula" was pretty exciting, honestly. Coming from season two to now, I feel much more comfortable as a person and an artist. I don't think I won just because a few reasons, I feel if I shared more of my personality on "Dragula," I would've had a better chance at winning, but since I was like combated by all the strong personalities around me, like really like kept me quiet. And I have a habit of just like listening and like observing what's around me instead of like interjecting myself for no reason, like some people - James Majesty. So I feel like that hindered me, but now I feel I can definitely have that loud voice that I need. - Me and Victoria were really close on the show, I think, as a lot of people picked up on. Even after the show, shortly after, we stayed pretty close and then we started to drift a little bit apart and then it kind of just became where we wouldn't talk hardly ever at all anymore. - She sent me home. I'm not gonna like that bitch. We're sisters now. - Instead of just winning a competition, I want people to understand my passion behind this. Winning this is definitely the most important thing to me at the moment. I just want to just show people, I'm your queen. Winning the special and getting to be on season four, honestly, isn't really what I want. I'd rather compete on a season full of champions that I know could be difficult to beat. And knowing that those are the top artists to compete with instead of a whole new cast of girls that I've never worked with before, I would rather go in knowing that there's some fierce competition that would really push me. And honestly, I don't mind waiting because I know that's what I want. I don't wanna win season four. Hi, welcome to Cooking with Victoria Black. Today we have some lovely worms that are gonna eat my flesh. So bon appetit! So for the last challenge, we are actually doing vampire and we are going to be lip-syncing to Kim Petras. I couldn't be more excited. This one, I get to really play up my true Victoria form. Time period wise, I'm looking at like 1700s, 1800s. I wanna be like a vampire that you wouldn't necessarily know is a vampire until they go in for that kill and get ya and start sucking the life out of you. Every detail is going to take a lot of like thought. So execution, I would definitely think, is super important. And I don't know if a lot of girls are gonna be able to do it. Not knowing what anyone is doing isn't really bothering me. 'Cause I can't imagine anyone building a whole set for their look like I did. So I feel really good right now. To win this would be honestly the biggest like life step. And I've always wanted to be that icon for like Halloween and being able to showcase I'm that bitch. - So you're that bitch? - I'm that bitch. That money package would also be really nice, especially since we're trying to plan our dream Halloween wedding. So that would be just so helpful. - When I was competing in season three, I was my biggest roadblock. I remember landing in LA and I was nervous as fuck. I had literally just got done doing drag in my room to now being on the world stage. I was shitting bricks the whole time. It's hard being in a room with all of those personalities. I would love to lie and be like, yeah, I think so and so should have went home. But in reality, I went home the day Maddelynn came for me. Like I had mentally already packed my bags. I felt like a failure. I felt like a failure. Maybe I shouldn't have been doing drag. Somebody else maybe should have had my spot. Now, I feel powerful. I know I can do anything. I can create shit out of thin air. - St. Lucia is one of those people that I believe put their best foot forward after the show aired. A lot of us that are like evolving artists, take that, any kind of critique that we can get, even if it's coming from ourselves, and we apply it to make ourselves better. And I think that's definitely something she's done. - I think the Boulets invited me back because they've seen my growth. I'm no longer like this scared queen who's sitting in the room being attacked by the catsuit queen. I'm ready to show people how much I've grown. Show people a lot more of me. People didn't get to see a lot of me. I'm gonna win this. I have so much to prove to myself. I have so much to prove to the viewers. I have so much to prove to the people around me. My goal with drag has always just been to exist and create. Drag is what I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to be doing this. This is like, this is, this is me. It feels like almost surreal to be back in this situation, like doing a vampire all over again. When I heard we were doing vampire, that one hit really close to home because I went home the vampire challenge. So originally, my vampire, I wanted to do a part two to the one I did that I got sent home, man, but I was just like, you know what, I wanna do something unapologetically Saint. And I love to do period pieces. So I decided to take you guys to the '60s. The '60s, it was a goofy ass time. I've always used the rose to symbolize my drag. So when I was creating the look, one of the things that I was having a hard time with was that psychedelic '60s flower. So I wanted the flower to almost have like to represent me, almost like my past. So I took the psychedelic flower and almost made it like it was crying a tear for the loss of me. For this floor show, to drive mine over the top, I've decided to build a personalized set to match the look. Plus, I have a bit of a psychedelic surprise for y'all. I would love to win the money, but being able to compete on season four and show people how much I've grown would mean a lot more than anything money could buy. It would mean a lot. Like that would mean the world to me. That was one of my lowest moments in drag. So for one of my lowest moments in drag to turn into like one of my greatest achievements would just be, it would feel like a redemption almost. If I make season four, I won't be anywhere where I am now. I plan on being better than this. Growing up, I didn't have the best childhood. My dad died when I was three. My mom bounced around guys. I got my first two tattoos on my wrist when I was 11 1/2 years old. My stepdad had come home drunk and he was going on like a tirade about how, you know, I'm his son now. He brought someone over who had just got from out of prison to tattoo his initials on my wrists. My first two tattoos that I got at 11 1/2 were my stepdad's initials. So I've started tattooing myself from 12 1/2 all the way into adulthood. I figured my body was already ruined from something that I didn't want on myself. So why not go the full mile? Around the time when that happened, I was in a lost place. That was just my outlet to express myself almost. I've had conversations with my mom about, you know, not having the best childhood, but they're fruitless, they're just fruitless conversations. As a gay person, I think we find community in other gay people who've had the same experiences. I found community and family in other people who've had the same suffrages as me. So this particular year has been, it's been a very trying year for black people everywhere. Seeing like people who look like me be shot and killed with like no justice done has been really hard to watch. And I sit, on a position where I have a platform. And at every given turn, I've tried to use my platform to bring more light to that issue. I was in New York and it was right after George Floyd was murdered. I remember speaking on the mic and I remember having to, I remember being really scared to speak on the mic and it was really hard to speak on the mic, because like I was gathering all my confidence in going up there and talking on his behalf. And it meant a lot to see people's eyes like hearing me speak about some man I didn't know, but I know my platform and I know I need to use it in the best ways I can to highlight people who look like me. And just being on "Dragula" and showing queens of color that you don't have to do drag in any kind of way. I always wanna like be, I wanna be the light for people. I want to show people, I've always wanted to create the stuff that I wanna see. And now I wanna make sure that people are seeing this stuff that I create so they know that they can create things as well. - I remember like telling myself, if I get to do this again, I have to do better, like, I don't care if I win or lose. I just have to like do better to like show people. On my head, I recently tattooed on my head for the first time and I tattooed my drag hand and originally the tattoo was supposed to be my drag hand touching my child hand. Because I'm the person that I wanted to be when I was young or that I wanted to know. And I hope that people see this and I hope they know that they can do whatever they want as well. I know there's been so many moments in my life where I felt like I couldn't do something. And if someone would've just told me like, no, it's just right there, you just gotta take it. I wish that I was that person back then. And I'm so happy to be that person now. And I really hope people who see this know that that is just right there, you just gotta take it. - My vampire, she is just a high queen priestess dripping in jewels type of bitch. And it represents for me my whole drag career. I started off like with the glamour and the pretty stuff. And then she's going to morph into a slimy ugly vampire. So what I'm doing now is I'm using polymorph plastic, which are little round beads of plastic that are hard, then that you put them in the water and then you can mold them into pretty much whatever shape. You can make horns, you can make a fucking mug. But I'm using it to form my teeth. It's gonna create a form of my teeth inside of these plastic fangs so then they seat perfectly. Oh shit, that's hot. Oh shit, that was really fucking hot. - My inspiration for the vampire was to kind of go ancient. Like the beginning of vampires, the first vampire, very Bram Stoker's "Dracula," where he becomes a bat creature. - So I knew we were gonna have wings, I just didn't know how they were gonna happen. So this was made, they were painted and this is powermesh with latex over them and then airbrush. So now it's kind of like flesh, so they're pretty durable. And we decided to go with the glove so I can wear it. And then it'll be glued to my flesh. So kind of just becomes a part of me. I'm a little concerned about the lip sync because we have to lip sync to the Kim Petras song and I am gonna be wearing a full mask prosthetic. I'm gonna see if I can maybe cut a little into it so there'll be more mouth movement. It's gonna be sex, it's gonna be blood, it's gonna be gore. It's gonna be "Dragula." - So right now I am working on my vampire. And I'm going for like a see-through, nude blood splatter, just dripping jewels, and be very, very elegant and almost like an expensive vampire, you know, she's got a budget now, so. So I'm wanting to do something kinda like "Dusk till Dawn" mixed in a little bit with the Countess, but like in a dive bar just like, kind of like true to my persona, but also very fancy and just trash. - So I went for a full like wasteland cave-dwelling humanoid that's basically survived this like nuclear bullshit, whatever is happening actually in the real world right now. So we'll just call it instead of post-apocalyptic, we'll just call it 2020 vampire. So this is the torso piece for my vampire. As weird as it sounds, actually, my biggest inspiration for like the tubing and stuff came from "Dune." They have these suits that they er-made in the movie and they basically take the sweat that their body would produce, and they had this filtration system that's built in that turned the sweat into drinking water, and that's how they were able to survive so long in the desert. So having these like tubings and kind of things, you know, vampires, obviously you don't drink water, but I mean, who's to say there's not blood in these, so. I don't think anybody can come near it. And I don't think that I can be like replicated in any way. And anything that I'm doing is not gonna be what someone else is doing. - My vampire look is inspired by current events and COVID. It is a post-apocalyptic viral vampire. I am whipping up some awesome fake blood. The drag queens' old faithful. And this is a performance-based challenge. So I'm a little bit nervous. The episode that I went home was a performance challenge. This outfit is my only outfit that doesn't really include a lot of latex because I'm going to be angle grinding. And if I angle grinded, my garment would explode off of my body. - This is it. This is the finale, I am so ready. This is going to be amazing. Get ready, you guys. 'Cause this is going to be a performance of my life. - I don't believe that anyone with sound mind and sight would underestimate me. - I'm going to win because I feel like I have grown the most. I'm gonna tell yo ass to cut the check. I hope it clears. And give me my coin. - I think that I'm the only choice to win this competition. My growth, since my season, has been insane and unmatched. I am like just that bitch, girl. - This is it, this is all I have. I'm giving you everything. I'm throwing it all out there. See you in season four, bitches. - I strongly believe that I can really take what this show's all about and show the world that and just keep progressing. And hopefully the world can transition with me. - It's important for me to win the competition overall, because I'm exactly the queen that "Dragula" represents. - This is my moment. And I'm gonna take it this time. - I have to start off by saying that I love our demented little family. - I do too. I am so impressed with everything that they brought to the table. - I don't think that we've seen drag performed to this high level of artistry. Like anywhere before. It doesn't even necessarily seem right to be judging them per se, like as if it were like a normal season. - Yeah, they've already been through this competition, they're all stars already. So this is almost like just a showcase on all of them again but someone does have to win, because we really need to find somebody who's going to kill season four if they come back. - Exactly. Let's start off by kind of going back in time and begin with season one, let's start with Loris. - Okay. - I thought it was really fun to see Loris again. - I believe fully that Loris is the best makeup artist that's ever competed on "Dragula," like hands down. - So let's talk about Loris's witch look. - When Loris came out in her witch look, I was like, Loris is gonna win this. - She really showcased her ability to work with unconventional materials. It was leather, it was vinyl. It was flawless. - Yes, but then let's move on to the ghost look, which for me fell flat a little bit because it didn't really say ghost to me. And I don't- - At all. - There were so many ideas going on. It was like, this is a tribute to my friend, but this is also a half man, half woman. And it was all these things but ghost. - It was like, there was a demon, we had staples. Sometimes her interpretation of the challenges can be a little off. - Let's talk about her vampire look. - I think her vampire look was a cool concept. It was sort of like this futuristic interpretation, like a vampire in the wasteland. - Her performance was incredibly weak. - And it was a performance challenge. - She got caught up in the fact that we were on location at the train station and it was night and it was dangerous. And you know, she was running out of time and I think she panicked, she was kicking her props around. She said cut, at one point, to the camera. - Can we make this a little tighter, y'all. - Keep going, Loris. - I think she really cracked under the pressure. - I think that's what happened too. - So moving on, let's talk about Frankie Doom. - Yes, let's. - And how much fun it was to have Frankie back in our house. - Frankie is so fun. - No, Frankie is wild. He's big hair, big personality, big tits. And that has not changed. - Yes. - One thing that has changed, though, is Frankie has gotten really good with prosthetic makeup. - Yeah, absolutely. - If we look at his witch look and it was a great homage to the Grand High Witch from "The Witches," Angelica Huston's shoes are big shoes to fill and I'm not sure if Frankie filled them. - He was really fun to watch him perform. But I did think it almost felt the little cosplay, which I'm not sure is what we're looking for. - When it came to Frankie's witch performance, he really missed the mark when it came to the reveals. She's marching down the runway and it's mask gone, hair gone, and three seconds in, we're into the reveal, and all of that anticipation, it just wasn't there. It was completely wasted. - Let's talk about Frankie's ghost look. - When it came to performing onsite at the LA river, I thought Frankie was completely fearless. - Yes. - We were in public. She looked like such a ghoul, but she was showing off those shark teeth, stomping down the runway, she jumped right in the river. And I thought that the performance when it came to the ghost challenge was right on. - I thought her makeup was really impressive too, for the ghost challenge, I think she did a great job. Let's move on to her vampire look. Frankie's vampire was incredible. If there was a living embodiment of Fangoria magazine in the '80s, it was Frankie. - Oh, it was super punk rock. It was vicious. Bram Stoker's bestial. Frankie was having a ton of fun doing that character. I think that Frankie's was probably one of my favorite vampires out of all of them. - Very Frankie Doom. I thought that look and performance was A+. - Speaking of a good time gal, let's talk about a season two monster Kendra Onixxx. - I've always said that you should never judge a performer based on when they go home in a competition. And the reason being is because even if you go home first, it just might not be the challenge that was right to you. It just might've been unlucky that a challenge you weren't strong on came first. You could have made it to the end and won. - Well, let's talk about her first look, which was her witch look. I thought from the head up, she looked amazing. - Yes. - I was a little disappointed from the neck down though. It just seemed too crude. - It did seem more after thought-y, the outfit itself seemed more like ripped up white material. Although I thought the feathers on the feet were a really nice touch. - I agree. - Let's talk about her ghost look. - I wanna start with the fire gag because it really captures the spirit of this show. - That's what thought. - To face your fears. - We didn't have exterminations in this special, but she found a way to bring an extermination and say, I'm gonna face my worst fear. So I have to give her props for that. I don't think the ghost was her strongest look. - Absolutely not. - I don't. I thought the dress was, the gown was beautiful. - I thought the hair was like a really weird choice. The body paint that was supposed to give us this illusion of her floating kind of fell short. I think overall the ghost was a flat line except for the fire gag. - All right, let's move on to Kendra's vampire. I wanna say that Kendra is probably the strongest lip syncer on the special. - Kendra's vampire had a few surprises for us. The hair reveal, all of that slime. There were horns and you know, pieces that she kind of hid, the grotesque part of her vampire, she hid with that beauty and then ripped it all off halfway through the song. It was really effective - she's a great performer. - Let's move on to Dahli. - Dahli is a great example and proof that when the question gets posed, can you change as an artist, the answer is yes. - I love the texture of the face. I love the headpiece. It was just giving me desert witch fantasy. - That skin texture was so effective. It was transformative. From the neck down, I had a little bit of an issue. I felt like it was almost too simple. It seemed like someone laid out some fabric and just cut it into strips, it took me out of the fantasy. - It was a little DIY, but I can get down with that if it's done well. I think it was. Interestingly enough, moving on to Dahli's ghost look, I thought that looked a little DIY in a way that I didn't favor. - My interpretation of Dahli's ghost look was that she was presenting as a plant spirit. For me, it was something right out of a Guillermo del Toro movie. I thought it was gorgeous. - Dahli's ghost presentation was almost religious to me with the lighting and that stigmata moment. It was really incredible. I loved it. - Let's move on to Dahli's vampire look. Dahli had my favorite vampire look. It was from another dimension. - It was absolutely one of my favorites. I think that she did a great job with the look. The lip sync was on point. She had a lot of energy in her performance. I loved it. I'm excited by Dahli. I think that she has a very unique perspective. I think she brings something new and innovative to drag. - I would love to see Dahli on another season of the show. - Something I want to remind you about Dahli. When we cast season two, I thought Dahli was going to win the season. So when she kind of gave up and left, I was shocked. - It was crushing. - It was. And to see her now talk about it and say that she regrets that decision every day, I just feel like she just couldn't handle it, but she's different now. Now she could handle it and that's exciting. - That's very exciting. So let's talk about Victoria Elizabeth Black. - Let's start with Victoria's witch look. To me, 10s across the board. - Excellence. I mean, Victoria's witch was an example of excellence. She was living, you could tell. I mean, you could tell the opportunity to perform that witch was everything she wanted. - She built that set. I mean, how could you find fault in that. - Her ghost had nothing to do with the challenge. I mean, it was so physical and like corporal that it could never exist in sort of like an ethereal world. It was all grizzle and guts. And it had nothing to do with like spirit at all. - I mean, if it was a zombie challenge, she would have won, but it wasn't, it was a ghost challenge. - And it was incredible. And she built the morgue and that was also incredible. - Right. - But when the challenge calls for a ghost and you deliver a zombie, what are the judges supposed to do with that? So let's talk about Victoria's vampire look. - Victoria's vampire look was beautiful. I mean, it was gorgeous. It was a scene out of an Italian vampire movie. - She, for me, delivered like the most beautiful, the only, the most important concubine of "Dracula." The only one of Dracula's brides that actually matter. - She performed so well this time, which is something she used to not be as strong at. - Super strong, 100% confidence. Right, one of her issues in season two was sort of coming out of her shell and showing her personality. I feel like that is no longer an issue. Only thing I wonder is, and this is a strange question, but is it correct to have her compete against a new cast? To me, I almost feel like Victoria should be competing against champions and winners only. - She is a titan. Victoria is a titan. - She also seemed hesitant to come back on season four. She wants to win this competition. - Exactly. - But she doesn't necessarily want, or she didn't seem like she necessarily wanted to compete on season four. It's an interesting conundrum with Victoria. - It is. - Let's move on to season three. Let's talk about Priscilla Chambers. - Probably the most fun we had on this journey was with Priscilla, I mean, she's so fun. It was great to spend time with her again. - Let's talk about Priscilla's witch look. - Well, her coming out of the swamp was incredible. - With the taxidermy and the worms in her mouth and the hooks and the whole grungy filthy kind of attitude, I was smiling the whole time because this is Priscilla. This is the Priscilla that we know and love. - What did you think of Priscilla's ghost? - Priscilla's ghost was top tier for me, not only because it had an incredible message, but the look of it was so hot. It was dripping with sex. It looked like an '80 video that I would've fawned over as a little kid. - The message that she incorporated into her performance was so important. It's amazing that Priscilla used her floor show and her platform to project that message out into the universe. - So let's talk about Priscilla's vampire. Priscilla's vampire look was not my favorite. I thought it was beautiful, I thought she looked gorgeous, but it sort of like fell in the middle for me. There was nothing that jumped out that said, hey, this is memorable, I love this. I think Priscilla's performance of the song was strong. She's a dancer. And we don't have a lot of dancers in the "Dragula" family. So I always love to see that, but I think her performance sort of matched the look for me. It was good, but we're looking for great. - So let's move on to Saint. - I think Saint was the most surprising competitor that we had on this competition. Saint is another great example of a performer who maybe went home early on their season, who hasn't been invited back and has another opportunity to show what they're made of. And she blew me away. So let's talk about Saint's witch look. - I love Saint's witch look, I thought it was unique. It was innovative. It was something I didn't expect. And it also wasn't so perfect that it turned me off. If that makes sense. - Saint's witch look was so imaginative. It was so beautiful. There was a lot of skin involved, which kind of highlighted her tattoos. It was sort of androgynous. Her performance and her look really just cast a spell. - There was something fresh and unique about her look, - It was very unexpected. - Moving on to her ghost look, her ghost look was my favorite look of the entire competition. - No, Saint's ghost look was truly horrifying. - I love that she took a classic trick or treat ghost - Exactly - and turned it into something scary and horrible. I love the re-interpretation of a classic image like that. It's just, the whole thing is horrible. - It was so disturbing. - So what did you think of Saint's vampire look? - Saint's vampire had a very fashionable style to it. It kind of brought us on an acid trip where blood was sort of like the drug. It was very imaginative. Saint's vampire may not have been the biggest costume in the room or the most expensive looking, but it may have been one of the most stylish. - And she was great at the lip sync portion of it as well. The way that she opened up about her story, it was the first time that any competitor on the show shared their story. And it literally brought the whole crew to tears. When we cast her for season three, I saw something special in her, she has a star quality, but she was so covered and cocooned when she was here and now the cocoon has gone. And I feel like the person who she has become is just really inspiring and refreshing. We have a lot to think about, but I think I've made up my mind. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. - Israel, take care of these packages for us. - Trick or treat, uglies.
