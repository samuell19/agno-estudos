I've been dreaming about my wedding since I was a little girl, ever since my first wedding to Dante, when we were seven. He was this cute scrawny little kid that lived in my neighborhood. He had a crush on me and I thought he'd be as good of a husband as any. I always said I was gonna have a wedding as beautiful as my pretend wedding to Dante. ♪ Wake up. ♪ It's a brand new day. ♪ Got nothing standing in my way. ♪ It's looking beautiful in a whole new way. ♪ Oh, it's time to wake up. ♪ It's time to make a change, goodbye to yesterday. ♪ I hear my heart saying, it's going to be ok. ♪ I have enough of tears. ♪ I've had enough of this, so no more dreaming. ♪ Wake up. ♪ It's a brand new day. ♪ Got nothing standing in my way. ♪ It's looking beautiful... But now I'm grown and successful, and I still think about the wedding sometimes, but what I think about mostly is the perfect guy proposing to me and me getting my real dream wedding. The wedding I've been planning in my head since I was seven. And I know I'm gonna get it. I don't know who's going to give it to me, but I'm going to get it. Hey! Hey, what time is it? What do you mean what time it is? I don't know, I brought you some coffee. I gotta go. What do you mean you gotta go? Are you not gonna stay for breakfast? Baby, I don't even like breakfast. Since when? Since always, baby. What is up? You're acting weird! It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. Oh, you're rushing outta here like I'm some type of booty call? Do you like your flowers, baby? They're beautiful. Keith? - Yes? - Where are you going? Baby, listen, I gotta go, I gotta go, come on. - You gotta go? - Yes, baby. I don't understand, didn't we have a good time last night? Yes, we had a great time. We had a great time, listen, I just gotta go, I'm late. - You're late? - See you later, come on. Keith! Keith! Baby, I'll be back. What?! Oh, he gets on my nerves. Trisha, I can see you! Open the door, girl. What's wrong with you? Keith. I see. So I guess him sending you flowers worked, huh? I thought I was finally done. Well, did you tell your lower half? What happened? Well, the problem is that he always expects me to be there and I want more. Have you told him this? Yeah, I keep telling him, but he doesn't get it. Well, why not just leave him alone? 'Cause my lower half doesn't want to. Maybe he's changed. Maybe he does want more. What? Keith. What'd he say? He said, "I'm sorry I had to run out on you this morning." But he ran out on you? Yeah. "But I really enjoyed seeing you last night." I'd love to take you out for dinner tonight. Let's recreate our first date. I'll meet you there at 8. "Wear that black dress I like." You're not gonna believe what emojis he used. See, it sounds like he has changed. Maybe you just need to give him a chance. Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe he is different. Ooh, what if he's proposing? Okay, see? Now you're talking crazy. You always do this. Just relax, go have dinner. Nothing more, nothing less. Right. Relax, right. Girl, let me go find that sexy black dress. Make sure it covers your lower half. ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ Gonna shine like stars ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ In a little black dress ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ Gonna make this night ♪ Oh one you'll never forget ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ Gonna look so good ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ Can't take your eyes off me ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ Gonna make this night ♪ Oh one you'll want to lead ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ You can't take your eyes off me ♪ Oh oh oh oh There was a time that Keith was really romantic, and now he wants to recreate our first date. Maybe he really is trying to change and take our relationship more seriously. God knows, I've been asking him and wanting more of a commitment. Maybe he's finally taking me serious. Yeah, you know, that was funny as hell. I liked it. - Yeah. - It is a nice night. It is, it is. You always been kinda silly. Always made me laugh. That's good. And I can appreciate that, you know? Yeah. You look really, really good, babe. You look pretty good too, Keith. Thank you. Look, I know we've been back and forth for some time now and I know you feel like I never really took us serious. I want you to know that that's all changed. I think it's time that we get serious about us. Is that right? Yeah, I'm ready for the next level. Trisha? Yes? I think we should start dating again. What? I think we should start dating again, baby. Let's do it, I'm ready, baby. What? Goodnight, Keith. Hello. Well, how did it go? It went fine. Uh-oh, that doesn't sound good. What did he say? He said he wanted to start dating again. What else? That's it, that's all he said. I thought it would've been a little bit more than that. Me too. Well, what did you say? Nothing, I was too in shock. Well, maybe this is a good thing. You guys can start fresh and take your time. I'm tired of taking my time, I'm tired of waiting. When is it my turn? It's gonna be your turn soon. Yeah, right. You wanna get together tomorrow? We could just eat and binge watch something on Netflix. I would love to, but my parents and brother are coming over for dinner. Okay, well, call me this weekend. And, hey, it's gonna be okay. Love you. Love you, too. Baby, you got it smelling good already. I thought you was gonna help me cook. Baby, I am helping. How? I brought in all the groceries from the store. My parents are about to be here any second now and I have a lot to do, Keith. You said you was gonna help me cook. What do you need help with? You know what? Forget it. Baby, you just said you need help, so I'm asking you, what do you need help with? I want you to want to help me. What are you talking about, Trisha? You know I don't cook. See, that's what I'm talking about. Are you really getting upset because I don't know how to cook? No, I'm getting upset because you won't try to make the effort to help me cook. I offered to help! Baby. What? Why are you doing this again? Doing what? Always finding something to fuss about. Look, Keith, I only asked you to do one thing, one thing today. Baby, why you trying to cook all this stuff anyway? I mean, nobody asked you to do that. If it was that serious, I could have just stopped by the store and bought some food or either had someone to cater it. It's not about the food, Keith. You said you needed help cooking. Why don't you get it? It would be nice if you did things when I asked. It would be even nice if you did things without me having to ask you. I did something this morning without you having to ask. Oh, come on, Keith. I'm being serious. What, babe? You never take anything serious. You don't even take me serious. You just come around when you want to. And when you come around, you don't even pay me any attention. Baby, how much attention do you need? I mean, I try to come around more, but it's not enough. I try to do nice things for you, but it's not enough. I mean, I offer to help, but it's still not enough. Nothing I ever do is enough for you, and it's sickening! What more do you want from me? You know what I want? Forget it. You know what? I'm done, we're done. What? I'm done with this. I don't deserve this. I deserve someone who cares. I'm not spending one more minute with some inconsiderate jerk. It's really good, pumpkin. Thanks, dad. - I mean, it's aright. - Oh, come on. Is that why your plate's almost empty? Well, maybe I didn't wanna hurt your feelings. Oh, whatever. You know you're going back for seconds. I think those are thirds. Yeah, right? So how's everything with work? It's good. Business is booming and I'm getting new clients every day. Okay, well, that's a blessing. Yeah. How's that crazy assistant of yours? Stephanie, she's crazy, which is good. Hey, you think she ever gimme a chance to really like-Nope. You know, honey, we are really proud of you. We really are. What? So, how's dating? You seeing anybody special? Well, Keith, you know we off and on again. Keith? Yeah, Keith. What's wrong with Keith? - What's right with him? - Mom! Dad, you feel that way too? Yeah, if I'm being honest, I never really cared for the fella. Really? Why? He just didn't seem like he was interested in committing to you, you know, settling down. No, Keith and I are thinking about getting married. Girl, ain't nobody gonna marry you. Yeah, I'm not getting any younger. Yeah, If that ain't the truth. Listen, baby girl. Don't even worry about him. I know you thought you'd be married by now. I mean, I know I did. You know, as a kid, you spent almost every day after school talking and planning your wedding. I mean, you were obsessed with getting married! Just give it some time. You will meet the right one soon enough. Oh, oh, oh, speaking of, honey. I know somebody who might be good for you. Dad! The only way you gonna get somebody to marry you is if you pay him to do it. Ah, ma! That's what you get. No, seriously, honey. You remember that fella you tried to marry when you were a kid? I ran into him, and you know what? He asked about you. Yes, he did, he did! No, no, no, no, no. Mom, wasn't that the kid that used to drink his own spit? Yep, that's the one. Nasty little... Stop, stop, mm-mm. What y'all need to do is focus on JJ. He's single and he needs somebody desperately. That boy right there? He ain't got nothing to offer. - That's my baby. - Hey, I'm right here. We love you. Bless my baby heart, it's okay. I love y'all too, whatever. On Tuesdays. JJ, you lonely, huh? ♪ Hey there, lonely boy Whatever, I'm going to the bathroom. Y'all ain't got no more edge, just stop messing with that boy. Ay yo, sis, I don't like the perfume you got in the bathroom. Ah, just stay outta my stuff. Listen, sweetheart. We really enjoyed dinner, we'll see you later. All right. Get some rest, okay? Call me tomorrow. - Come on. - All right, all right. Hey, you know I was lying about all that marrying stuff, right? - I know. - No, I'm serious, sis. You dope, any guy would be lucky to be with you. Really? Yeah, but that Keith dude, he ain't it, all right? Yeah, all right. All right, I love you. Love you too. All right, good night. Bye. ♪ La la la la la la I never thought I'd see the day where I would go speed dating, but what's a girl to do? How else am I supposed to find a decent man? Maybe I should give it a try. You have no idea what I did today. What? I signed up for speed dating. You did what? Girl, weren't you just getting over Keith? Girl, my biological clock is ticking, okay? I gotta move on from Keith. Besides, Steph, I get 803 emails, and these guys seem like they're ready. What? Let me see! Holy! Yeah, you wanna help me pick out some of them? I'm not about to go through 803 emails.

Oh, he is definitely going on the list. Especially his lower half. Yes, I see it. I can't believe you doing this, girl. I'm just tired of waiting. I wanna get married, I want a big, beautiful wedding. Ooh! I could definitely marry him. Let me see that. What is it? Keith. Oh, Keith. Yes, girl, he's called me like 20 times, but I'm definitely done. I'm done with you! Yes, Keith, I'm done! All right, all right, let's look through some more. Let me see. You know you have some women in here? Are they cute? Well... Oh, you know, you can't really do this, right? Do what? This is crazy! You're talking about meeting random strangers at a bar.

What you doing? - Okay, good, good, good. - Cool! Well, we gonna try our best, I mean... Okay, now I'm having second thoughts. What am I doing? Maybe this isn't a good idea. I should get out of here. Excuse me. No, I can't handle any more dates tonight. No, well, my name is Carter, and I didn't mean to startle you, okay? But I've been watching you and I just have to ask, what is a beautiful woman like you doing speed dating in a bar? Well, I wouldn't be, if the guy I used to date would just marry me already. Interesting. Well, I may have a proposition for you. What kind of proposition? My boss is looking for a bride. Maybe I can introduce you to him. A bride? Why? Who is your boss? His name is Benjamin Sanders. His family owns a technology firm. I'm his assistant. Is your boss hiding from the FBI or something? No, he's just a regular guy. Sure, a regular guy looking to marry a random girl he's never met? Well, that's funny. What's so funny? Well, the irony, for one. I mean, aren't you looking to date some random guy you've never met? Touche! Look, trust me. What? He needs this. And it will be a lot of money in it for you. Could be a win-win. Besides, who wouldn't wanna be married to a beautiful woman like you? Think about it. Let me know. - Hello. - Hey, so how'd it go? Any good ones? Actually, there was quite a few good ones, but you're not gonna believe this. What? So this guy comes up to me with a proposition, and he says his rich boss is looking for a bride. What? Why? I don't know, he wouldn't say. Are you gonna do it? I don't know. I don't even know what the guy looks like. All I got was his name. What's his name? Benjamin Sanders. Hold on, let me see. Does he work for a huge tech company? Yes, how did you know that? Because it says so right here next to his picture. He's really cute. He's smart too. You know, technology is a good field to be in. Maybe I should marry him. Girl, stop. I still can't believe you're doing this. Well, you didn't tell anyone, did you? Who would I tell? We don't have any other friends. You're really serious. I don't know. Maybe I should set up a dinner with him tomorrow. Well, do you need me to stop by to check and make sure you aren't kidnapped? Girl, he's not going to kidnap me. Mm-hm, okay. You know what? Okay, call me. Trisha, right? Ben, right? You look just like your picture. So Carter showed you my pictures? Uh-huh. Like your flowers? Yeah, I like them. And I like the line too. If you hear my phone ring, it's my best friend Stephanie. She's making sure you're not a serial killer. Let me ask you a question. What? Tell me why is it that someone as beautiful as you are still single? Well, I've been waiting all my life to have the perfect wedding and the perfect marriage, but I guess life has different plans for me. You could still have a perfect wedding. Really? Yeah, marry me. That's crazy. Nah, that's not crazy. Here's what I know about crazy. What I know about crazy is women are crazy, and men are stupid. And the reason that women are crazy is because men are stupid. Yeah, ain't that the truth? Yeah. My friend Stephanie thinks I'm crazy, but I don't know, maybe I am. Why? No, you should always do what makes you happy, okay? And if having a perfect wedding makes you happy, then I say do it. - Really? - Yep. So much so, I brought you this. What's this? It's just a simple prenup. It says you'll pay me $500,000 to be married to you for a year. Nothing else more? Nothing more, nothing less. Look, I'm just like you. I'm tired of looking for Miss Perfect. The only thing is if I don't get married soon, I lose my inheritance. Look, we both can get what we want off this deal, right? And then we can go ahead on and live our lives. Okay, so why don't you pay me a million dollars then? Done. Really? Yeah. And you'll pay for everything? Everything, whatever you want. This sounds too good to be true. I gotta see if you're some kind of crazy criminal or something. Listen, I'll have my assistant give you a call, give you everything you need. Okay, well, tell me a little bit more about yourself. Well, I- Trisha! Oh my God, that's my brother. What are you doing here? Hey, what you mean? I'm a here for dinner. Wait, you didn't get my voicemail? Girl, you know, I don't be checking my messages. Mom and dad didn't tell you? No, they don't talk to me much. Dinner plans have been canceled, JJ. Well, I can see that. 'Cause that ain't Keith. Who's Keith? He don't know about Keith? Hey, that's none of your business. Wait, none of my business? I mean, it's all my business when you got this strange man over here. Hey, this is my house! I swear you shouldn't be asking me questions like that. - Ooh. - You gotta go. - Oh so you gonna kick me out? - Yes. When I'm over here, just trying to look out for you? Bye. Can I just at least get like a sandwich or something please? Bye. Oh my God, I'm telling mom and dad. Whoa! You know, I have sisters too, and they always in my business. You really think he gon' tell them? He's definitely telling mom and dad. Yeah, he looks like he's gonna tell. Hey, just giving you another call to make sure you're alive, and not tied up in his basement or something. I just wanna tell you that I don't appreciate the way you kicked me out earlier. It was rude and I was hungry. Hi sweetie, it's mom. I just got a weird text from your brother. Something about a strange man at your place. I really couldn't make it out, just call me, okay? Is there some man in your house? Do I need to come over there? You just can't go barge in over there. I can if some man is there. I'm going over there. Call JJ. Leave her alone. Mm-hm, look, I told you I was gonna tell them, and that's what you get for not feeding me. And I'm coming over tomorrow for leftovers. Hey, why didn't you call me back? I was worried. Sorry I didn't call you back. Just busy. What is all of this? These are my wedding options. Sit. Okay, tell me you're not about to do what I think you're doing. Yep, I'm getting married, and the wedding's gonna be everything I dreamed of. You have officially lost your mind. Yeah, well, at least Ben knows what he wants, and Keith, I'm just tired of him. I'm ready to move on. What are you gonna tell your parents? What is he gonna tell his family? I don't know. I haven't thought that far yet. Oh, look at this contract. - Are you serious? - Mm-hm. He's really gonna pay you this much to marry him? Yeah, he's paying for everything. That's why I need your help, Steph. You know this is a fake wedding, right? Yeah, it's fake, but it doesn't make it any less stressful. - Okay, let's do it, but, - What? I'm charging premium since your fiance's paying for it. Hey, charge whatever you want, we got the money! - Ooh, okay. - Try this cake. - It's good, right? - Where's the chocolate? ♪ Daja, let's go ♪ I can see it in the movies ♪ Quite a lot of stories ♪ Read about it on the magazines ♪ ♪ Some people try to fight it ♪ Others try to hide it ♪ Some don't even know what it means ♪ ♪ But when it gets you so fast ♪ Never get to see you coming ♪ There are those who try to hold back ♪ ♪ To keep themselves from falling ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ Just saying I think I'm in love ♪ Now this is what I've been dreaming about, this moment right here.

I just thought we could choose together. Maybe we can find something that you like a little bit, I like a little bit- Let me take this, give me a second. What? You know what, Trisha? I know that you want this to be the perfect wedding, so how about we let the professionals take care of it? I spoke with the top wedding planner in the state and she agreed to come in and take over the whole thing. It's great, right? I don't know, Ben. Come on, trust me. Okay? No. No what? No, that's not what I want. You promised me I can plan the wedding that I want, and what I want is to plan the wedding that I'm supposed to plan with the man I'm supposed to marry. So are you gonna help me choose or not? Fine. Call you in the morning. Hey. What you doing? Girl, it's seven in the morning. You have any plans today? Yeah, I gotta meet Ben today to go get fitted for his suit. Oh, well, call me later. Okay. Bye. Bye. What are you doing here? I'm here for you. Ben sent me. He what? Yeah, he's busy with a meeting. So he sent me to handle all the wedding stuff. No, he didn't. It's fine, really. He's supposed to get fitted for the suit. If that's all you're worried about, - Yes. - Then we're in luck. Look, he doesn't do anything for himself. I buy all his suits for work. It's gonna be fine, come on. Oh, this doesn't make sense. It'll be fine, trust me. Please record your message. Trisha, answer the phone, I know you see me calling! I don't understand why. Just answer the phone! Vanilla. Vanilla, this is good. See? Wasn't that bad hanging out with me, was it? No, it wasn't that bad. But, Carter, I wish Ben was here. He just doesn't seem so interested. No, no, he's interested. He's just really busy with his business, that's all. Oh, okay. Thanks for coming along. Not a problem, you're good company. - Am I? - Mm-hm. Thank you. All right, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Oh, and tell Ben don't be late tonight. Got it. Hey. I'm here, sorry I'm late. - So glad you could make it. - Yeah. I thought you were gonna send Carter. Can you put your phone away? No, I'm sorry. It's just some business stuff, that's all. I don't care what it is, but put your phone away at least until we have dinner with my parents. Okay, my bad, phone away. Hey, I almost forgot. What? - You got a ring? - Yeah. Here. It looks gorgeous. Yeah, hey, you wanna try it on now? Well, maybe- Gotta make it look real, right? So... I don't know. We should wait 'till my parents find out about us. Okay. You nervous? Yeah, I'm nervous. Don't be nervous. Well, I'm nervous. It's gonna be okay. Let's just go over what we went over and we'll be fine. - Okay, all right. - Come on. Trisha here, with this strange man. Come on. What's up, lil' man? Everything good, mom? Dinner will be ready shortly. You have a beautiful house, Misses Sinclair. Thank you. What'd you say your name was? It's Ben, Benjamin. What type of name is Benjamin? So how'd you two meet? Oh, we met in college at... We dated for a little bit. - Really? - Uh-huh. We ain't never heard nothing about you. Yeah, we both were really into our studies, but then came across each other later, and the rest is history. Oh, where? Oh, it doesn't matter where. So Ben, what do you do? I work at a technology firm, coding. Oh! So you can hack into things? 'Cause I got this new computer. JJ, he's not hacking into anything for you tonight. Well, that sounds interesting. So you two said you had something to tell us. We're getting married. You marrying this strange man? He's not a strange man. You getting married? Yes, mom. We're getting married. - Oh, Jesus. - Wait a minute. You two said you just dated. Yeah, well, we feel like it's so much more. Yeah, we do. Mr. Benjamin. Yes, sir. - Let's talk. - Yeah, yeah. We need to have a real-Alone. Sweetheart, please. Yes. Sweetie, can we just talk- I already know what you're gonna say, mom. And what's that? That I'm moving too fast and we just started dating. Right? Are you sure you're not rushing into this? I'm sure. This is what I want, I wanna be married. I know you do, but I don't want you to regret it if it's not with the right person. You know, it should be with your soul mate. Is Ben your soul mate? All right, now, you listen here, young lady. Mom and I need to have a serious talk with you. It is unacceptable! Son, son? - JJ, just go. - But mom, - Go! - You're not gonna yell at- Nobody's yelling at anyone, now go. Just go, oh my God. Your brother's just too much. So Ben. Yes, sir. Technology, huh? Yep. You must be a pretty smart fella. Yeah, I guess you can say that. So the smart fella would usually come to the father first and ask for the daughter's hand in marriage. You're right, sir. That is usually how it goes, but you have an amazing daughter. She's beautiful, bright, ambitious, great personality. I just couldn't wait any longer to ask her to be my wife. Well, this isn't how I would've wanted it to go, but if she's happy, I'm happy. Thank you, sir. Yes, I'm glad we had a chance to talk. Good to meet you. Yeah, likewise, sir. - Happy life. - Yeah, it's the plan. You two had a good chat? We did. I'll meet you by the car. Okay. It was nice meeting you. You too. Take care. Likewise. I want you guys to know that I, don't worry about me. I'm happy, okay? We offer a lot of custom linings, London fog, and a lot of signature threads that we only offer. We would like you to check out some of our ideas and hope you like those. Ooh, nice. Ah, what do you think about this one? Which ones? Doesn't matter, baby. Which one? Which ones do you like? Well, it really doesn't matter. But babe, we have to decide. And I'm allergic to the flowers you picked the other day. We talked about the flowers a million and one times. You know what? We'll decide later. Thanks for coming. All right, thanks, no problem. You have a great day. Yeah, you too. Hey, hey! Hey. Back with the food. Oh, I'm not hungry. What's wrong? Your boss. He's just so standoffish and rude, and he's always on the phone. Yeah, listen. He is just really busy with his company. Yeah, you told me that, he's always busy with the company. Okay, look, I'm sorry that I keep making excuses for him. He's usually not this standoffish and- Rude! He's just very rude. Yes, yes. But, trust me, he is a good guy. Yeah, well, I wouldn't know. So, these the flowers you chose? Well, I chose them, he didn't choose them. Guess I gotta start over from scratch. It really shouldn't be this hard. Okay, well, how you gonna help me? All we have to do is determine what you're like, and then just choose the appropriate bloom. Oh yeah, it sounds that easy, huh? How do you know how I'm like? Okay, you are, let's see, adventurous. So the amaryllis, huh? Yeah, I like those. See that? Don't they look adventurous? - Yeah. - I like those. And your heart is full of innocent love and beauty, so, the white orchid. - Those are nice. - Oh, oh, and maybe the rose bud, see that? And you are mischievous. So the petunia. Okay. But underneath it all, you're just sweet, so, the white carnation. I like that. Yeah. Food is here. Ooh, good, 'cause I am starving. Ready, Carter? Come on, man, let's go. Yeah, all right. So when do I get to meet this mystery fiance? He's at work. How long you gonna keep me waiting to meet him? You'll meet him soon enough. Are you guys gonna move in together after you're married? Well, right now we like our own space, but eventually we'll move into one place. Crazy, right? Actually, no, I've read about it. A lot of people are doing it now. They're keeping their own space. Some even have separate homes, it's very new age. Well, I'm meeting him later for lunch, so we'll talk about it. All right, I'm about to go run some errands. I'll see you later. - All right, bye. - Bye. Just hanging with Carter is always so effortless. It always feels so natural, I'm always at ease with him. There are no games being played. With Carter, I feel safe, I feel like I'm at home. Trisha! Why haven't you been answering my texts or phone calls? I can't do this now or ever. Or ever? What are you talking about? We're done. Yeah, but we always say that. Well, this time I meant it. And what makes this time so different? Trish, ready? Yeah, ready. So this is why. No, Keith, it's not what you think. Who's this? Carter, this is Keith. Keith, this is Carter. Keith, what's up, man? We should go. Let's go, bye, Keith. Let me hear one more clink. That's a good clink. Spicy. So have you heard from Ben? Yeah, barely. He texted me, barely could get his words out. Yeah, that's Ben. So, tell me about him. Who? Who? The guy. Come on, your ex-boyfriend from the cafe. - Keith? - Yeah, is that his name? Okay. Oh, yeah. Hey, how did you know he was my ex? Come on, I know an ex when I see one. They got a certain ex look. Yeah. Plus, he looked like he wanted to kill me. He probably thought we was together. I know he saw the ring. Oh, you think? This is Carter with the, Carter right here, yeah. Yeah, I think you knew what you was doing. I did. So tell me about him. Tell you about him for what? We just been together for years back and forth, I thought he was the one, you know? I'm sorry, we can be difficult sometimes. Yeah. I just couldn't get him to commit. He always made me feel like I was just asking for too much. You know? In my experience, you should never be with someone that makes you feel like you're asking too much, because the right person wouldn't make you feel like that. Really? So the back and forth, you know, I get it, could be scary to put yourself out there sometimes, but believe me when I tell you. - What? - A woman like you, a man should be sure about. Oh, come on, really? Girl, listen, if we were dating, there would be no hesitation. Oh, come on. You are amazing. Fine as hell. Cool and funny. What man wouldn't wanna lock you down? Apparently Keith. Besides Keith. Keith, he's got issues. He does. - I'm just saying. - What? Don't get hung up on one guy who doesn't see what another man would in you. Okay. Okay? You wanna help me pick out some dresses? Let's pick out some dresses. Can we finish that drink first? Yeah. I like your advice. I'm serious. - Serious as hell. - This is good, this is good. Good? Come on already, I need to see this dress. I'm turned around and I got my eyes closed. Oh, I hear it. No peeking. Okay, I have not. - All right. - Oh, yes! - You like it? - Yes. Let me see it in all it splendor. Can I have a first dance? Can we get some with it? Oh, oh, all right! Is that how we doing with the snap? Are we snapping over here? Girl, let me see it again. Let me see with the spin. That is nice. And then you going for the dip. Let me dip, let dip. Oh, I ain't gonna drop you. - Please don't drop me. - I won't drop you. Let me get one more spin though. All right. And then you drop me, but don't drop me, dip me. All right, you ready? You ready? You ready? And then dip. Don't drop. I said don't drop, I knew you were gon' drop me. Yeah. Carter. Carter, you gotta get up. There's someone at the door. Oh my God, I didn't realize I fell asleep. See you later. Hey girl. Don't oh, hey girl me, like I didn't just see some man running outta your house. Oh girl, that was just Carter. - Carter? - Yes. I thought you were marrying Ben. I am, he's just Ben's assistant. He was just coming over here to help me. Hmm. What? What's hmm? Trust me, it's not even like that. You know what? You're not gonna believe what happened to me yesterday. What happened yesterday? I ran into Keith. Where? At the cafe with Carter. And how was that? And why are you and Ben's assistant having lunch together and waking up the morning after together too? I told you, he's helping me with the wedding. And Keith wanted to know why I hadn't returned his phone calls. What did you do? I didn't know what to do, so I just introduced them. Keith wasn't feeling it. He really looked hurt. Well, you moved on, sort of, and, plus, you said you were done with him, so. I know. And Carter and I talked when we got back to my place, and you know what, girl? He made me feel so much better. Hmm. He's really a sweetheart. Let me find out, you're getting over your ex by sleeping with your fake husband's assistant. Absolutely not, we just hung out a few times. I'm just saying you had that look in your eyes. What? No! Well, hopefully when it's all over, you can leave Keith behind. Exactly. That's the plan. Oh, more company. Can you get that? I gotta get dressed. Oh, what's up, Steph? Hey, JJ. How you doing? You know, I'm alright. I could be doing so much better if you gave me a chance. A chance at what? You know. Ew! Leave her alone. You know, you're practically my little brother, right? See, look, why you gotta go and ruin it like that? But Steph? Yeah. So you know about this Ben guy, right? Yeah, why? 'Cause he's marrying my sister and I don't know much about him. What do you need to know about him? A lot! 'Cause what? Some guy just comes outta nowhere and now you're marrying him? That's kind the weird, sis, you know what I'm saying? - Hey! - I don't understand it. Okay, I'll let you two get caught up. That was close. I know, I wonder why he's asking all these questions all of a sudden. I mean, I kind of get it. This all happened out nowhere, and it's fake. My bad. Keep your cool, keep it down. You know how nosy he is. He's just gonna keep asking questions. Carter? Hey, I didn't know if you had food, so I brought you some, some. Aw, how sweet! Nice to meet you, I'm Stephanie, the best friend. Nice to meet you. Look, I'm just gonna get going. Bye, Carter. Whoa, which one is this one? - That's Carter. - Who the hell is Carter? This one? Look, I'm her brother, JJ. Look, sis, I don't know what type of freaky thing you got going on over here, but I'm telling mom and dad. And thank you for the sandwich. What's going on? I think I'm just in over my head. I don't know what's going on. I mean, I always wanted the perfect wedding, and Ben is making that possible for me, but I always loved Keith, and I wanted to marry him, but obviously he doesn't feel the same. Can I ask you a question? Yeah, what? How do you know that you loved him? - Who? Keith? - Mm-hm. I don't know, we just been together for so long, I'm just used to having him around. I mean, can I ask you a question? What about you? Have you ever been in love? Yeah. Yeah. I once read somewhere that you are sleeping 'til you fall in love. And at first, I didn't know what that meant. Then I met someone. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't do anything, but think of her. At night, I dreamt of her. When I woke up, all day I couldn't wait to see her. And when I did see her, my heart turned over. And I was filled with desire. Hey. Good morning. Good morning. You okay? Carter, what happened last night was a mistake. My emotions were all mixed up after seeing Keith, and it should never happen again. Okay, wait. Are you saying that there's nothing between us? No, I'm sorry. Look, we should just focus on planning the wedding. Carter, you're a really good friend, but I can't handle anything else. I don't get it. You spend all this time searching for someone to love you, and now that you have it, you're just gonna let him walk away. Hello? I've been trying to call you. Why haven't you been answering your phone? I need to talk to you. About what? About us. We've been over this, I told you we're done. I don't know going on with you and that guy, but I want you back. What? Yes, I want you back, babe. I want us to be together, like really together. Since when? Since always, I just didn't know how to do that. And all of a sudden you do? Why, because I'm with someone else now? Who cares why? All I know is that I can't stop thinking about you and how bad I messed up. And I know I messed up over and over again. And I know I don't deserve another chance, baby, but I'm asking for it. Keith! Just let me come over tonight, that's all I'm asking. And after that, if you want, I won't bother you again, but please just let me come over. So let me get this straight. You slept with Carter last night? Yes. And you're marrying Ben? Yes. When Carter left, Keith begged you to take him back? Yes. And he wants to meet up with you tonight? Yes. Girl, what are you gonna do? I don't know, that's why I called you. I don't know why. I've never been in a situation where I was stuck between the guy I want, the guy I chose and the guy who chose me. Okay. Let me ask you this, do you like Carter? Like, actually like him? I like the idea of him. He's romantic and caring and, you know, he really sees me. But you've already agreed to marry Ben and signed the contract. Right. That part. - Well. - Well what. At least it won't be a real marriage, and it'll only last a year. Yeah. I like the idea of a wedding, but I just wish I can get rid of all these men. What about Keith? You said you were done with him. I was, I mean, I am, I don't know. He just sounded so sincere, plus, we've been together for so long. Right, but haven't you been down this road with Keith before? I mean, he's the whole reason you're doing all this fake wedding stuff to begin with. Yeah. Well, Keith and I have a lot of history together. I guess I'm not ready to let him go, like I thought I was. Okay. What? Who would you rather be with when the WiFi goes out? What? Just what I said. Which one would you rather be with when the WiFi goes out? I don't know. Well, it looks like you have a decision to make. History or a new beginning. Hey, babe. Hey. Ah, thank you so much for meeting me. Don't thank me yet. The flowers you got me are beautiful. Yeah, they're your favorite. Yeah. Look, I'ma just get right to it. I know you engaged and all. What? Oh, right, right. Yeah, I mean, and I don't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm probably too late, but- - Well- - Trisha. What? I love you. You what? I love you, and I always have, I just didn't know how to say it or even admit it to myself. You know what? That's all I ever wanted was to know how you felt and what I meant to you. And I'm sorry that I couldn't give that to you. Where has this Keith been, huh? I ordered your favorite. I like him. Who could this be? Oh my God. Trisha, just coming to see you. Calling the phone, you wasn't answering, and I got worried. I guess there's no need to be. Keith and I, we were just talking. Talking? Looks more like a date to me. No. I'll call you later. He's gonna call you later? What's going on with that? What are you doing here? I told you I was coming to see you. Since when have you wanted to see me, huh? You haven't been interested in anything. Okay, I haven't been involved in a lot, but who cares? I'm paying for everything. - That's not the point. - No, that is the point. I'm footing the bill to give you the wedding of your dreams, and you out here dating other dudes? I'm not dating other dudes, that's just my ex, and we have a lot of history. I don't care, Trisha. I don't want you seeing him again. You can't tell me what to do. You know what? I don't have time for this, goodnight. What? Give me those! Keith and I have history and a connection that I can't deny. Even though I can't stand him sometimes, I really feel like he wants to change for me. Ben could actually give me my dream wedding with no problem, but I don't have any real feelings for him. It wouldn't be fair for either of us, but then there's Carter. Carter could actually be the perfect guy, but I don't know if he's the one for me. I don't know if I have real feelings for him. Trisha, girl, where are you? Answer the phone. That's it, I'm calling JJ. What, JJ? Ay yo, Trish! Yo? Trish! You know, I take out your trash, right? Stephanie called ma looking for you. Said she ain't heard from you since yesterday. So ma sent me over. Yeah, I don't feel like talking to anyone, JJ. And what happened, sis? - Nothing happened. - Oh no, something happened, 'cause I see chocolate wrappers, and you don't eat chocolate unless you're either nervous or stressed. And since you have all of these flowers everywhere, I'm guessing you're stressed. Everything is just so messed up. All right, what happened, Trish? Yeah, now I don't know what to do about it. Wow! That's a lot. Look, please don't tell mom and dad, I don't feel like talking to 'em about this. No, I ain't gonna say nothing this time. That's crazy, Trish! Why you sound so old and wise? Why you sound so old and wise? 'Cause I always been. But... You see what I'm looking at, right? Oh my gosh, you want some chocolate, here. Yeah, I want some of that chocolate. And it better be the good kind, ooh. Okay, I see what you working with. Now, what you watching over there? Thank you for coming over. I wanted to talk to you about something, Keith. Yeah, I'm glad you called. I need to talk to you too. I was thinking about how- Wait, let me go first. Why? What's this? The house. I can see that, but why are you showing me this? I closed on it today. I wanted to tell you about it at dinner, but I didn't get a chance. It's beautiful. Yeah. I'm serious this time. You know I'm engaged, right? Yeah, I know, but listen- Wait a minute, wait. Baby. You really just can't stay away, can you? - Bro, who are you anyway? - I'm her fiance. I thought the other guy was your fiance. What other guy? The one you went on the date with. Who you went on a with? No, it was Carter and it wasn't a date. It sure looked like a date to me. Look, I did call Keith over here, but Ben, it's not what you think. Oh, it's not? Then why am I here for? Yeah, what is he here for? Bro, why are you here? I came to talk to my woman. Look, guys, this is all a messy situation, I know, but Keith, you been on and off with me for years, and now you wanna be serious? And then Ben, we doing a fake marriage! Oh, fake what? A fake marriage, this wedding ring isn't even real. Look, and this is all your fault, Keith. My fault? How is this my fault? Because you've been playing with my head for years now. So I desperately signed a contract for someone to marry me. Just wanted to know what it felt like to be wanted. Stephanie was right. This is crazy, all of this is crazy. Both of you get out! Why do I have to get out? I was here first. Yeah, and I'm marrying you, so why I gotta leave? Because I need to think, and I can't do it with the both of you here. I'll call you. Okay, so which one of us are you talking to? I don't know! Just go! - Hey, hey, hey! - Come on, man! Mom, am I crazy? No, no, of course not. You're just very passionate, and you want what you want. You're just like your father that way. How did this all get so messed up? Because it's life, sweetie, it's messy. Why is it so messy? Why can't it just be simple? Now, what would be the fun in that? Yeah. I'm surprised JJ didn't tell you guys all about what's going on. Trust me, your father tried to get it out of him, but he wouldn't budge. What do I do? Well, the only thing you can do now is follow what's in your heart. Yeah, but what if it's wrong? There's no way of knowing that. Just gotta trust yourself. It's gonna be okay. We're gonna get through it. Come here. It's gonna be all right, baby. I hope so. It will, trust me. Listen to your mama. Mama knows best. Hey, darling. Hey daddy. Well, I talked with your mother and brother. Let me guess, you think I'm crazy too? No, nobody thinks you're crazy. We wanna make sure you're okay, no judgment. I'm okay. I just gotta figure out what to do. You probably won't know until you do it. I just want someone to love. I know you do. Nothing's wrong with that, okay? Okay. These apples are so good. - You know what? - What? I'm surprised JJ ain't come around. You know, food out. You know that boy can eat. He can eat. Thanks, dad. Are you ready to do this? I am. Okay, I'll be out here waiting. Hey, baby. Hey. You want a drink? No, I'm okay. No drink, that's not good. Keith. I have to let you go. Yeah, I knew it wasn't good. And Keith, I need you to let me go. So you chose him over me? No, I'm not choosing him over you. I'm choosing myself. Look, we've been doing this long enough. I can't keep doing this. I know. I'm sorry for all of this. And I know you deserve more. Take care of yourself. It looked like it went well. Yeah, it did go well. I feel good about it. I'm just glad you're finally able to close this chapter of your life. What? You ready for this next step? - Yeah, let's do it. - Okay. Let's go.
