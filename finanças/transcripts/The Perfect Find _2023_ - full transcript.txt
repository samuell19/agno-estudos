They say it's harder for a woman to get a job when she's been out of the workforce too long. I know all of that, Mom. You are not gonna wake up one day and be over Brian. You were with him for ten years. That's damn near divorce! It's a process, and part of the healing is getting back to living, your friends, your job, and the city you love. Mom, wha... wha... what's going on? Your father won't touch me while you're here. He's afraid you'll hear us. You have got to go back to New York. You will land on your feet. So I'm gonna have to ask you to... - No. - ...get out of my house. I love you, sweetheart, I do, but you're a grown-ass woman!

Mm, thankfully, I don't mind working for my own. Now I'm just back and ready to jump right into things, so... You can be real with me. You were devastated. I can see it. I mean, it wasn't easy. You were humiliated. I mean, it was heartbreaking. And those headlines. - At least they were talking about me. - Oh, yeah, they were! What are you gonna do? Therapy! That's the kind of talking you need. I don't need a therapist, Darcy. You know the Darzine Gala is bigger and more exclusive than the Met's now? I need a job. Come on now. You stole every job I ever wanted, and you fucked my boyfriend. - No. - Mm. I just happened to get all the jobs you ever wanted. And I will say this one last time. Darnell said he didn't have a girlfriend! Oh. Okay. You know what? All those years of me not getting those jobs that were rightfully mine inspired me to build this. And now I call all the shots, and I can't even remember what it's like not to. - Yeah. - Right? But it's a shame your subscription model failed to launch when you shuttered print though, right? I'm sure you're aware that a strictly advertising model is unsustainable. But I'm preaching to the choir. You know that. Okay. Okay. I admit we failed to hit one goalpost. Just one. Just... I need a job, and you, Darcy, you need a me, so... Ask me. I can't say yes if you don't ask. Darcy? Yes? May I please come work for you? You have 90 days to make meaningful change. - I'll do it in 60. - Don't overpromise. - Don't underestimate me. - Don't underperform. Is that an offer? Handshakes are prohibited, but your signature on the paperwork will do just fine. And you'll have to make an office out of the zoo showroom. Welcome to Darzine. Oh, and you're welcome. What am I supposed to do with these? - Keep 'em. - Burn it. I heard he's dating a broke-dick me with a snaggletooth and bad credit. He couldn't keep up with the real thing so he got a knockoff of a knockoff. Clearance rack. Yeah, well, I'll just be over here dead. - Dead to the bed. - Mm-mm. You will not be dying over Brian. Now working at Darzine, though, that shit might get you in a casket. Yeah, what was that about? Some keep-your-enemies-closer thing? - I didn't see this plot twist coming. - Me either.

I don't know what the fuck you're gonna do! I don't know you! Okay, yo, take a breath, all right? We were drunk. We made out at a party. The world will continue to turn. Everything's good. It's cool.

You guys are spoiled and ungrateful and entitled. Yeah, okay, I know what this is. And I read about 40-plus-year-old professional, single, Black women being bitter and mean, but I always thought it was a stereotype. - No, those are Tyler Perry movies. - You'd fit in perfectly. Have a good one, ma'am. Eric got him some vintage pussy. Some throwback! Some AARP pussy. Yeah. You know she got some skills. She probably got all kinds of new tricks. She 'bout to school you, boy!

Oh, Jenna, my love. - Darling. - What happened? I was chasing Taraji P. Henson, and I slipped on my meditation marbles. Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry. You were chasing Taraji? Yes. Taraji P. Henson. My peacock. She's one bad bitch, but sadly, she perished in the fall. - Right. - Come on. Come. Come. This way. I have the perfect spot. Maybe... We'll do it here. Right here.

Okay, yeah. Um... Your new collection. We'd love to hear about it. Taraji! How was I supposed to know her damn pet peacock died? I thought it would be epic. Oh, nah, it was epic. It was an epic fail. - Why didn't you stop me? - Are you serious? Yeah. As if you consulted me at any point during this entire process. This was your struggle idea. Own it. It's my fault, okay? It's all my fault. My whole life is riding on this job, and I keep fucking it up. Jenna, believe it or not, I know what I'm doing, all right? Why won't you just let me help you, collaborate? It'd be easier. Okay. You can answer that. I'm good. Is that your girlfriend? Ex-girlfriend. Very recent ex. No. Oh my God. Tell me you didn't break up because of what happened between us. Oh God, please. I wouldn't be able to live with myself. - Oh my God. Are you kidding? - Yo. Hey, someone let me out this cab. - What? - No. I mean, if I caused harm... Like, I am not that girl. I'm a girl's girl. Had I known... Yo, your ego is crazy. First of all, nothing happened between us. Well, nah, something happened. That was, like, level one. That was mild. Come on, now. Mild! That was, at least, medium sauce. Second, she and I were already broken up, so you're good. "Girl's girl." Oh my goodness. Oh. It's cool. What's her name? What does she do? How old is she? Her name is Madison. She's a ballerina. She's 22. Of course she is. Yo, okay, what's up? What's the deal? Like, you got a man? What's going on? I'm in between relationships. Mainly because men my age want women Madison's age. Mm. Mm. I don't know. Maybe they're not interested in dating women who are complicated. - Oh. - Yeah. So Madison's simple. Madison is sweet. So that's why you broke up. You got bored of your sweet, simple girl. - That's not what I said. - That's what you meant. You know, this whole bitter and jaded thing you got going on, it's a really bad look on you. It's like some bad energy happening all right here. Yeah. Okay, got it. Got it. You know, I can't... I can't stand you. - Oh my God! - Yeah. The feeling is incredibly mutual. - Oh, you're gonna go? - Yeah, I'm out. - Yeah. - All right. There's something about that guy. He drives me crazy. And he just knows how to irk me. Well, he's Darcy Hale's son. He's probably half demon. I can't even... I can't even trip off at him because I don't feel like myself now. I don't... I don't feel like I have it. I feel rusty. I'm struggling. I've researched and pitched out this whole concept. And now I'm like, "Can I even deliver?" I don't feel like I can. Of course you can. Everybody has imposter syndrome, but you just gotta dig deep. Find what excites you, Jenna. You got this. - Problem is he excites me. - There's that. - That's the problem. - You gotta find what else excites ya. - Yeah, what else? - Excites you more. Hi. Is it really you? Oh my God.

Yeah, I want to apologize for upsetting you last Friday. I'm not upset. - You were upset. - Nah, I'm good. I just think maybe we shouldn't talk about our personal lives at work. Agreed. Uh, and I would appreciate it if you would stop making references to me... being old and bitter. Nah. Nah, I hear you. Um, I mean, you kind of started it with the whole being spoiled, being a brat, talking 'bout my generation, that whole spiel. It's kind of corny, but... Yeah, yep. No, I hear you. So... - Truce? - Truce. Hey, the other day in the cab, um, you were talking about how, you know, your career is riding on this. Yeah, 'cause it is. This is super lame... Lame! ...but I Googled you, and you're kind of a big deal. You know, I don't get any of this. Shit. You saw that I went through a terrible breakup, got fired from my job, and have been enduring painful, vicious memes of myself for over a year. - That was all on the first page. - It was my rock bottom. - Is that from Rock Bottom? - No more personal questions. Okay. Why you got a picture of your grandma? She kind of fine. That's all I'm sayin'. - Stop. - Ah. Nah. Nah, I'm just kidding. Gotcha.

Thank you. I'm kind of obsessed with her. I mean, she was such a trailblazer, and... I don't know. I just love old Hollywood movies. Likewise. It's like time traveling to a version of humanity. I could have never imagined this. Look at you. Seriously, I've... I've never met anyone who knows anything about Nina Mae. Master's in film from USC, remember? Put to good use.

That dude was a cornball. Listen, once I heard he had dental and vision, he was an option. You know, it's all fun and games till you lose a tooth. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what do you want? Like, in life? You know what I mean. What do you want? Uh... You know that Greta Garbo movie when she, um, plays the seductress? Flesh and the Devil, 1926. You know that scene in the church, during communion? Of course. And she takes the chalice that he just drank from, and she caresses it. Mmm. And then she sucks from the same spot. - It's profane! - It's profane as fuck. It is. - But it's pure, you know? - Yeah. I wanna love so desperately it's obscene. - You know? - Hmm. I wanna love so intense it makes people uncomfortable to be around us. - Hmm. - That's what I want. What? What? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. No, I hear you. I hear you. Wow, it's, um... It's late. I think I'm gonna head out. Okay. - I don't think so. - You don't think so? No, I don't think so. - You wanna play Parcheesi? - Mmm. - ♪ I don't know what it is ♪ - Scrabble? ♪ That you've done to me ♪ That's what you call it? ♪ But it's caused me to act In such a crazy way ♪ ♪ Whatever it is that you do When you do what you're doing ♪ - ♪ It's a feeling that I want to stay... ♪ - Can I borrow this? - Oh, that's how you feel? - Yeah.

Hey, I, um, wanted to talk to you about... Eric, I'm about to save Darzine. Oh, do tell. Yeah, so I was staring at the poster, thinking about last night, you know, and our mutual love of old movies. - Oh, that's what you were thinking about? - Yes, Eric. Movies. - Okay, Jenna, what hit you? - Nostalgia. Right? Every time I watch an old movie, there's always going to be one garment that I'm like, "I would kill for that." Like a bathrobe or a spectacularly tailored dress or a gold belt or a fur muff. Then you're always left thinking... "They don't make things like they used to." But what if they did? What if they did? Last weekend, I met a designer who makes the most fabulously constructed items, and they're all reclaimed vintage. Her craftsmanship is couture-level. - Okay, no, I like where this is going. - Okay. But we need a hook. You know, what's the cool factor, the influencer, the it-girl viral goal? - Like, who is that? - Right. Um... Remy! Oh shit. That's Remy Ma. Mama, thank you. Thank you. Of course. Anything for you. You know that. - And thank you, Becca. - Of course. Okay, I like this. This is good. - Let's make it happen. - Ready? Let's get started. - Yeah?

How you doing? Let's celebrate! What are you doing? I got champagne. Come on! Get outside. Let's celebrate. What are you doing? I'm outside. I wanna celebrate. Come on. Follow me. Let's do it. Okay, you're right. This is epic. Right? I got the champagne... Ah! ...that I borrowed momentarily. That's why it tastes so good. We make a great team. Yeah, I really think we're on to something here. Me too. Oh, yo! Did I tell you about Becca? She agreed to make limited edition pieces of everything that we shot. And you're welcome. I personally lined up a dozen influencers to post and be a part of the series. I really think this is gonna land. I'm not just talking about the work, Jenna. Yeah, um... About that. About the other night... - Don't say it was a mistake. - No. No. It wasn't. Mistakes don't sound like that. Okay, you weren't so quiet either, mister. You know, for obvious reasons, I think we should just leave it behind us. Why? Do I have to spell it out for you? Five letters. Starts with a D. Come on, now. My mom doesn't run us. Like, honestly, we can start our own thing. We could take over this whole film and fashion scene. These are our ideas. Yes, they may be our ideas, but they will go nowhere without a real, legit company to put them into. Look, your mom may be a raving narcissist, but it has put her at the top of the game. Wow! I never thought I'd hear you defend her. - No, I'm not defending her. - Wow. But I'm saying my future is now attached to hers. And what future is that? A future of respect and making a name for myself and having more than four walls to come home to. That future. I respect you and all your walls. Why are you like this? - Why are you like this? - I'm just saying. I know a good thing when I see one. And I think you do too. I am inclined to recognize when positive action leads to positive results. All right, I hear you. I hear you. Put it behind us. That's it. - 'Cause we're professionals. - Completely. - We do our jobs. - Do our jobs. - Not each other. - Not each other. There you go. But tonight, I wanna ruin you. You wanna destroy me?

That was nice. I... I didn't know older women, you know, got the Brazilians. Why would you think I would have, like, a '70s bush? How old do you think I am? I thought, after a while, you just like, "It is what it is." You know? That you give up? You're just like, "Meh." Not necessarily give up. It's just like, it is what it is. Born in the '70s is not the same thing as, like, embracing the aesthetic. I noticed the screaming eagle or whatever is in the middle of your chest. Screaming eagle. What is that? I couldn't identify what type of bird. It's a, um... It's a dove, actually. So, who's Otis? Uh... Otis is, um... - It's my dad. - Hmm. Yep, my faja. I never heard you talk about your dad. Yeah, um, he, uh... He died, so... I'm sorry. Yeah, nah. Nah. He was killed when I was two. My God. This is just getting worse. What... What happened? Well, I mean, of course, I don't remember much, but he was, uh... He was mixed up in some mess. He was in the streets, so... That must've been hard for you and your mom. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't know. She isn't exactly an open book about it. You know, I caught her crying once, but then, like, never again. And I don't wanna upset her, so it's really just been about me trying to piece things together, figure it out myself. You know, I keep my distance, especially when it comes to, you know, my dad. But... yeah. That's a lot. It is a lot. But, you know, I don't know. I mean... Maybe she's just missing that parenting chip, you know? I probably am too. No. Nah, really. My movies will be my kids. Yeah, I definitely see that. Oh man. Seriously, though, I'm... I'm thinking about doing a film about my pops. Yeah? About his life, though, not his death. I wanna just celebrate who he was and, you know, his life. Yeah. That sounds incredible. Thank you. I like you. Oh, you like me? I like your ass. I like your ass. But I like you. I like you. Oh man. What happened with Mr. Rock Bottom? Well, we met in college. We were both crazy overachievers. And we were dating and... It was so good and great, and then we became, like, this, like, thing, you know? Mm-hmm. This power couple. And we're moving and grooving, and the next thing I know, ten years have gone by, and I'm like, "Wait, hold up." "This fool has been stringing me along." I just wanted more. What more? A family. You know? Something to show for it all. Like, you know, when it's all said and done, you have this amazing family. Yeah. I've pretty much just given up on my dream. I mean, you can have new dreams. - I can have new dreams. - Mm-hmm. That ten years brought you to me. You're cute, you know that? - Oh my God. - What? Ten years ago, you had a lab partner. - Oh my God. - And a locker. What matters now is I'm a man. I'm your man. Oh, you're my man? You think you're my man? Hold on. I'm not? I would have probably said something more along the lines of, like, forbidden fruit. You know, like a naughty kiwi. Like a mysterious blueberry. - Forbidden fruit. Wow. - Yeah.

I've been trying to get in contact with you for weeks. Have you, really? And E, you shady motherfucker. I've been blowing up your DMs too. Yeah, Suki and I went to high school together, back before she became a fancy top model. - Weird. - You can't be serious. Do you not know that Jenna, like, totally discovered me? Oh, no, I didn't know. Yeah. Yeah. In a beauty closet at Darling magazine. - Right? - Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Oh shit. Oh my God. This is so hot. - No! - I ship this. - No! No! - Nah! Nah! - No. - No way. Nah! - This is research for the... - Research. - Research? Right. - For the Darzine... Cute. Research? Cute. Okay. It's cute though. I ship it. Don't... This isn't good. Not at all. She knows... Everybody. Ship. So I'm sure you've seen this already. "The king." We took the liberty of reading it on your behalf. Mm-hmm. Would you like the highlights? Hurry. Bad news first. - There is no bad news. - There is no bad news. It's really all how you look at it. "My proudest achievement, this place." "Not the property, but the life I made here with the woman who made it home." Aw. I mean, it sounds like somebody misses somebody. I was gone for over a year and did not hear from him once. - Yikes. - I gotta go. - Mm-hmm. With the magazine, though, huh? - Shut up. Skip to the last paragraph, girl. Jenna? Hey, Darcy, how are you? I want you to guess what my brilliance has conjured up. - Go on. - No idea. Try. A call from the New York Times. They wanna profile me as a... a publishing mastermind, a media mogul. Oh. Darcy, that's... that's huge. That's awesome. They wanted details on Perfect Find. I told them that was your brainchild. Well, mine and Eric's, yes. Yes, the two of you. You've been doing brilliant work together. Yeah, no, thank you for giving me this shot and for pairing me with him. Thank you. Yes, I did that, didn't I? I combined the two of you. You did. You have amazing instincts. I do. I do. Yeah, he's... he's really talented. You should be very proud. Oh, I am. Very. Are you? - Am I what? - Are you proud of my son? Yeah. Yeah. Proud of the work that we do together. - Sure. Yeah. - He does seem motivated. Well, that's just post-grad excitement. You know. And pleasing you. You must know that Eric has a small crush. Really? Okay. Well, I've never seen him so focused and dedicated. Girl, that's you. That ain't nothing but good home training and a quality education. I mean, yes, clearly. Clearly, working so closely with a powerful woman that echoes his mother is a factor, but let's just cut the shit, Jenna. Getting the job well done is great. But we don't need this moving any further into some kind of... distraction. Darcy, I promise you. There is no distraction.

Then you and her and the kids. It j... I... I couldn't take it. Come on now. Having fun with kids and wanting them are two different things. You know that. Yeah. Noted. You forgot the running-back-to-your-ex part. I saw you and him walking in the rain. I was actually coming to see you, but that's beside the point. That wasn't... what you thought.

Can you just... Can you just let me live a little bit? You might know me a little bit. A little bit. - Wee little bit? - Little bit. How long have the two of you been fucking in my house? Ooh. So, was it before or after I asked you to stay away from my son? - You did what? - Oh, yes. Yes, Eric. Grown women had a conversation about you, and now grown women are talking, so I suggest you either be quiet or you go to your room. You wanna know how I knew? I felt it. And I came to you as a courtesy, and you promised. I promised there would be no distractions. Hold up, wait. So, it's true? You talked to her and didn't run that by me? I said stay out of this. Jenna, are you serious right now? I promised you there'd be no distractions or problems, and there aren't. We work great together. And the numbers, they don't lie! You lie. You lie, and you sneak, and you cheat, and you've always been this way. I don't know why I'm surprised. You're sick. There's something seriously wrong with you that I run out of boyfriends to fuck, and you go after my son. - No. - No? We fell in love. ¡Por Dios! Okay. If it's not obvious to you in this little sex haze that you're in, um, you're fired. No, don't fire her, because I quit. No, you don't get to quit. You don't get to squander every sacrifice I've ever made for you. You didn't do shit for me! Don't you raise your voice to me. You don't go back to the office.

Whoa. Okay. Did my mom send you here? What? No. Eric, no. No. You sure y'all didn't have a grown-woman conversation? She doesn't know. Eric, I... I came to tell you. I'm just as surprised as you are. Really? What do you mean, really? We didn't exactly plan this. No, yeah. We most certainly didn't. Okay, look, I don't even need anything from you at all. I know you don't want kids, so it's all good. I... I need you to not tell me what I want right now. Please. Please don't do that. Okay, well, tell me something, 'cause what I remember is you saying, "I don't have the parenting gene." "My movies are gonna be my kids." Do you remember that? Were you wearing a wire? Did you rehearse this verbatim before you got here? No, Eric, I didn't rehearse it. I remembered it because it mattered to me. Yo, you're springing a lot on me now. Like, right now. Would you rather I not tell you anything? No, that's not what I said. Please stop putting words in my mouth. Well, your reaction isn't... It's not comforting. I haven't seen you in a long time. And the whole time we were together, you wanted to hide what we had going on. Now you come here. You invited me here. I'm not expecting this. I'm thinking we gonna chill and talk about things. Talk things out. You tell me I'm gonna be a dad, really? And I have no say-so. You already made your decision. Now you're trying to control my response. I'm not trying to control. I'm not. I'm not trying to control you. I'm trying to control me. And, no, that's not a choice you get to make at all. I need a fucking minute. I'm sorry. You took your time, and now I'm taking mine, all right? I don't wanna sit here and yell at a pregnant lady, so I'm gonna excuse myself, okay? Sweetheart, let me tell you. Don't worry about gaining weight because, honey, Mother weighed 250 pounds, and you only weighed eight pounds, eight ounces. Your father would take me to the restaurant, and I would not only have one dinner, I had six. And when it was time to have you, mm, I had to wear your daddy's shoes, 'cause my feet swelled up so big. So, listen, I can come out there and help you. You're gonna need help, honey. Oh, I'd like that, Mom. Thanks. Have you heard from the father? No. Not since I told him, no. You know, I'm just gonna give him space. I kind of caught him off guard. Sweetheart, don't make excuses for that man, okay? - Yeah. - It takes two to tango, right? - You didn't do this by yourself. - Mom, don't go there. You didn't get yourself pregnant. That might be the pillow that I sent you. Oh, okay. Hold on. I had to sleep on a full-body pillow when I was having you. Only time I could get any kind of shut-eye, because you just rocked and rolled in my damn stomach. All night long, it was like, "Oh Lord!" Good morning, Jenna. Sorry to drop in on you like this, but drastic circumstances call for drastic measures. I sat on a washing machine to try to get you going into labor. Uh, it's not the pillow, Mom. Can I call you back? Okay. Love you. Okay, bye. Darcy, what do you want? You've really outdone yourself, Jenna. Making me a grandmother. Can't say that I was thinking about you in that moment, but... There's a profile... for women who self-sabotage. Yeah, I... I think there's also a profile on maternal narcissists, but who's counting? Hmm. Nose job? Do you plan to live here? Raise my grandchild in this? - Can we just stop? Can we just stop? - Okay. Fine. I'm not playing this game with you anymore. Fine. This... This documentary that Eric is filming, was that you? No. This is something he wants to do for himself. - It's his story. He has a right to know. - Yeah, and I have a right not to tell him. Maybe. Maybe now that you're a mother, you might understand. Maybe I will. You know, I was in a very different position than you are when I had Eric. Ooh, my parents hated his father. Everything about him. Hated the crowd he ran with. Thought I was... too young, which I was. Oh, but I loved that man. And I wanted our son. Oh, and Eric was the most beautiful baby. And when his father was killed... my parents didn't come to the funeral. So it's... it's just been the two of us ever since. - I'm so sorry. - Don't you dare feel sorry for me. Made me stronger. My fierceness as a mother became my fierceness professionally, because I had him to fight for. I had a son to raise. My son. Now, I don't know whose karma this is, but your trajectory is impressive. But I won't do to you what my parents did to me. That cycle ends here... with me. Like it or not, we're family now. Yo. How sway? You know, I got my ears to the streets. I figured this out. Who told you? Take a guess. Oh, and it's a boy. You're carrying in your ass. What the hell? We're having a baby. You know I'm not ready for this. I'm young, yeah, but my mom was way younger when she had me, and you still mean the world to me. I don't wanna miss this. Jenna Jones. Looks like you won't have to. All right. Ooh. Look's good in here. I believe this right here indicates a healthy baby boy is on the way. - Oh my goodness. - Yo. - I'll give you two a moment. - Thank you. Mm-hmm. Congratulations. Thank you. Ah! Yo. That's crazy. Can you believe it? Wow, we did that. We definitely did. Wow. So, um... what do you think about the name Otis? Wow. You know, I didn't know much about my dad, but my son will know everything about me. He will. But, you know, Otis is gonna have my last name too. Deal. I like that. - Yeah? - Yeah. Otis Jones Hill. Two last names. - Sounds like a rock star. - Yeah. I'm the pappy. I love it. All right. Ooh, I almost forgot. Almost forgot. - Oh, what's this? - It's a paternity test. Yeah. It's for my mom. What? Mm-hmm. From Darcy. Nah, I'm just messing with you. You almost died. You almost... You almost died just then. It's two tickets to her gala. Be my date? Of course.
