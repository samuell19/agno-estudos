Excuse me. Captain Carson? - In the café. - Thank you. Carson. Is that your name? They tell me you're something of a pirate. And you'll do anything at a price. Anything. I need some help, Carson. Would that be enough to buy it? It might. We must have a talk sometime. All right. Now? You don't mind if I finish this hand, do you? Attero. Oh! Pass. Thanks, boys. I'll see you around, Mike. - I'll stay here, Skipper. - But lay off the sauce. Thanks for the temporary loan. You want any interest on your money? No, just to talk to you. Follow me. Been in Athens long? Twenty-four hours. Enough to find out quite a lot about you. You mean you started right in doing a biography on Carson? I'd say it came more under the heading of, of libel. You're described as a sort of dishonest Robin Hood. People just don't know me. Though they all agree on one thing. You will do anything for money. They know me. Where are you taking me? Relax. Imagine you're driving with Robin Hood. Yeah. Mm, I'm glad you brought me here. Is this where you discuss all your business? Sure, not everybody can have the Acropolis for an office. - How much? - Eight drachma. No, let me. It's my party. Then give him ten. You seem to be rich. I have to be to afford you. Then give him 20. - Cigarette? - No, thank you. Okay, what's your pitch? For a job, sweetheart, what's it worth? Name your price. Tell me what I do first. You have a very fast boat, don't you? You wouldn't be sitting here otherwise. I want you to smuggle me into Albania. Albania? Who'd wanna go there of all places? What do you care? Just tell me what it costs. - Where in Albania? - A place called Vosjev. It's only a few miles inland. Do you know it? I might. I also know Albania. It's a Communist country filled half with people and half with secret police, and they don't like visitors. Not poor visitors. But I understand, with enough money one can manage. Oh, sure. Like the visitors to Siberia manage. You look like a smart dame, smart enough to go somewhere where they don't use guns for costume jewelry. Look, Carson, I have to go. I have to see somebody. - A man? - Yes, a man. It figures, well, take some advice from me and save your dough, you won't always be young. When I want something, I can afford it. Look, I could drop you off there in Albania, it'll be a cinch. But for the first time in my life, I'm turning down good money because I've a conscience. - Huh! - Don't laugh. A conscience. You'd never get out of there alive. For the money I'm paying you you don't need a conscience. Put me ashore, that's all. - The rest is my problem. - No dice. And it's still your problem. Mike! Mike! Ah! Stop it! They're in there! Run fast! Come on. Come on. Hey, let me go! Bonjour, monsieur. All right, as long as you're here, you're gonna work your passage. Go on, get up there. Sorry, boys! It's all Greek to me! - Well, well.. - I have my uses, you know? You don't have to say that twice. Did you give Mike anything to eat? Mike? The dirty man who needs to shave? Poo. Passengers have no right to complain about the mate's kisser. I fed the mate, don't worry. - Uh. - Uh.. But he gives me the creeps even when he's sober. What, do you want a bet you don't have the same effect on him? Here, take the wheel. Keep an eye on the compass. Thanks. Tell me, my cabin I find it very luxurious for a boat like this. Well, the guy that owned it before me was a Brazilian millionaire. And full of fun. And I suppose you're going to change the policy. Your passage ends tomorrow morning on the Greek coast. What else do I have to do to make you take me? You're off course in more ways than one. Look, Vosjev is nearly 15 miles from where I'm going. It would take me 24 hours to get you there even if I can arrange it. You're asking me to lie off a country thick with patrol boats and maybe aircraft and wait for you? Oh, no. The cargo I'm bringing back is too perishable. What is your precious cargo? You tell me something first. Who are you? And you know something? I've seen that face before. Newspapers, maybe. Impossible. Yeah, when the cops were after Mike and me you seemed to have no objection to leaving, too. That's because tomorrow I'm going to Albania and going ashore, and nobody is going to stop me. - Nobody. - Well, what do you know. All I want from you is to do a job at a price. Nothing more. We never even discussed that, come to think of it. How much? And if you can't wait for me, pick me up on another trip. The usual fee is 5,000 dollars, but for you... Five you'll get, I don't want any favors from a good-price Galahad. You never let me finish. I'm charging you ten. Bonjour! First mermaid I ever saw. - But I have legs. - Seem to remember. They're not bad ones at that. Mm-mm. I've seen worse. Will you give me my towel? Venus rising from the sea. Hah! But I have arms, too. You're much too kind, anyway. Not as kind as you think. I still wanna know your name and who you're gonna see in Vosjev. You're being paid well, that's enough, no? You heard me, sweetheart. Tracy. - Tracy what? - Mallambert. That's funny, I've heard that name. What difference does it make? Never mind, I'll check with you later. - Where are you going? - Up to the monastery. Before I start on these pleasure cruises I usually go up on the hill and ask my friends for a blessing. - May I go, too? - You? Why do you think those guys retired to a monastery? But I don't want to stay here alone with Mike. Oh, you'll be all right. - He's sleeping off yesterday. - Ooh. Carson! Tell Kol Stendho I'll be waiting for him when he gets there. - Go away! - Give me a little... Carson is coming. He will be angry with you. A little drink, eh? Come on. Open, eh? - Come on, young... - Allez-vous en. Go away! Come on. Phew! A little drink, huh? Go away! Allez-vous en. Go away! Oh! Carson, help me! - Carson, make him stop! - Oh! - Oh! - Carson, take him away! Aw, you can handle it. This should be nothing for a dame who's going to Albania. Please! Ah! If Mike left anything, you can have it to settle your nerves. - Oh! That mirror. - Brazilian, remember? And full of fun. That's how he used to win girls and influence women. You broke the last of his perfume. Ah, but Mike never smelled this good before. - You better sit down. - Oui. All right, now be honest with me. We're both workin' the same side of the street. All right, but I'm not a communist. But your husband is. My brother. You're sure you're coming back from this trip? I don't know. But first I have to see him. More passengers, more money. I expected that. But then you must come with me to Vosjev. Do I look stupid? Don't answer that. I said I'd put you off in Albania. But they say you can bribe anyone there. Well, nearly anyone. But cigarettes and soap are a lot better than money. And when you get up into the hills they say all the people are against the present government. They're against any government, and always have been. - They're bandits. - I think I like bandits. Real ones. - How did you get started? - Natural talent. I was born wanting my own way. Oh, captain, what did I do this time? Nothing. Just made us some extra dough. - Now, go on. Beat it. - All right, captain. Oh, wait. - Apologize to the lady. - Oui. - Sorry, lady. - Okay, but no more. You better change to pants and sweater and boots. You'll be going into rough country. - Carson. - Yeah? I realize I'm a trouble to you, and I'm grateful. Lady, for 10,000 dollars I'd say gratitude's a little out of place. Mallambert... Oh, no. Not him. Oh, no. - Then you remember. - You'll never get him out. All right, then maybe I will stay. - You know what you're saying? - What do you care? As long as you get paid. That's right, it's your funeral, sweetheart. When the police came yesterday you said I looked glad to go. Why not? If they knew who I was, they would be more interested in me than in you. Do you realize what I've been through the last three years? Could be. And Albania could not be a lot worse. What do you want me to do? Bring down my violin for this? No. But Henri and I were so close. He's still my brother. Do you need to carry a gun? It's like a landing card when you're getting off an ocean liner. You still wanna go ahead? We have come too far to turn back now. But I will feel better if you come with me. And I'll feel better at sea. You can count on me for tomorrow night here if you're not doing anything else. Right. Stand by to cast off, and start the engines. - In a hurry. - Aye-aye, captain. Well, welcome to Albania. - This is Kol Stendho. - Delighted. This way. Hey, wait a minute. You didn't mention her on the radio. It's nothing. She's a tourist. Where does she think she's going? To Vosjev. You can arrange it, can't you? Carson... are you crazy? - Who is that woman? - Her name is Mallambert. You mean, she goes to see Henri Mallambert? - Why not? - Impossible. I thought nothing was impossible for you. You're wrong, this man is too dangerous to have any dealings with. I don't want to put my neck in a rope. She only wants to see him. I tell you, I'll take her off tomorrow night. No, and I mean no. Oh! - Well, go on, eat it. - So this is your cargo. - Perishable goods. - They're Greek kids. The Albanians have been keeping 'em here as hostages. We take 'em home. I think I may have said too much already. But I'm sorry for a lot of things I did say. Look, between you and me, I hate kids, but they pay well. Only four? It gets more difficult over time. Kol Stendho was telling me your brother's too hot. - No go. - I cannot accept that. Go and ask him. Tell me something, what makes him so warm? I can't tell you. But it is not possible. We're talkin' about a lot of money, Kol. You know I'll cut you in. No. By the way, how did you know he's in Vosjev? Why do you have to go now? And don't waltz with me, sweetheart. Until six months ago he was in Moscow. You read the newspapers. "Mallambert the diplomat who went over to them.“ Then something happened. And we discovered they'd sent him away. Since then, silence. Now I must know what happened. I must talk to him. There's not a chance of taking him out even if he wants to leave. You'd better get used to the idea. If it's necessary, I will stay. That also is not possible. Why don't you forget the whole thing? - You've had a nice cruise. - No. You have your truck? I would like to help, but I repeat it, it is not possible. Kol, it's only 15 miles. It would take you no time at all. Nobody would have to know about it. If she is his sister, at least let him see her. What is it? You know something? Now she just has to see him. Don't worry, kids. I'll be back. - Boom-boom. - That's right. You look after the rest. You mean, you mean you're coming? It's gonna cost you plenty. Do we have to walk? Carson, you are forcing me to do something that I... We're partners, remember? I'll be a good boy. And mademoiselle will be a good girl. The children, getting them out... Yes, that is business. But this Mallambert... I told you, I'd leave him there. That's a promise. I wouldn't bring him out. If it is otherwise, you will be sorry. Okay, partner. I'll tell Mike to bring the boat in again tomorrow night. - What is it? - Shh-shh. It's okay. None of these men can read. But suppose they search in the truck? Oh. Another checkpoint. It happens all the time. Was that necessary? I told you this was dangerous country. Oh, yes! But those children back there... I still don't quite understand. Some of 'em were carted off during the civil wars. Others were children of Greeks who lived here before their politics changed. Lots of those men have fled the country since and... And they could not take their children. And you... Good-price Galahad. - Isn't that what I called you? - Don't get me wrong. This is one shipping company that's never shown a loss. This is where you start walkin'. From here you must walk a distance, perhaps, of two miles. Vosjev you can see when you're over that hill. Remember, I cannot associate myself with this. - Sure. Sure. Any guards? - No guards. Yeah, no need for 'em I guess. I will return today at midday. - Carson, again I must warn you. - Sure, partner. You've already asked me for too much. I get you. I get you. Why should you have understood there weren't any guards there? I was beginning to hope you were different from other women. - Oh? - That you didn't ask questions. Sorry, I'll try to be more like your ideal. I'm sorry, too. Oh, I've been pushing my luck with... with Kol Stendho. I blackmailed him into doing something he didn't want to. I blackmailed you into coming with me knowing you wouldn't leave me here alone. It's a nice racket, blackmail if you've got the right build for it. Come on. Looks dead. No smoke, nothing. I think you'll find there's someone there. Why so jumpy? You've had less trouble getting here then you would going from London to Paris. And far less trouble than tryin' to take the subway to Brooklyn. I am not afraid for myself, Carson. Did you hear? Henri. Henri? - Ç'est toi? - Take it easy. Henri. Henri... Oh. Who's there? Who is it? Who is it? Monsieur Mallambert I have your sister with me here. Your sister Tracy. Tracy. - Oui, Tracy's here, as always. - Oh, Tracy! - Oh, Henri! - Tracy! I don't know who you are, monsieur, to have brought Tracy here. But whoever you are, I'm grateful and... All you need to know is that Mr. Carson is a very brave man. And I can't stop crying because I found you. And he's going to help me to take you home. - Home? - Oui. How wonderful. How did you get permission to take me out of Albania? Is it possible they agreed to that? Well, well... So it's like that? But we are going to take you away. - We are! - It's not quite that simple. Did you know about this? Yes. I heard someone say something last night. Oh, please! Do you realize what you're asking me? - I promised Kol Stendho. - I will pay! I will pay! There are some things you can't buy. In my business, a double cross... Anything goes, tender ones, anything. Sweetheart, you can put that rope around our necks. Maybe you have already. I think I know you better now. Have you the heart to refuse me? Please. Please. What is this? I do not understand. Please... We got a long way to go. Let's move. Ah, we're going home, Henri. Ah, we're going home! That will be very nice. Tracy, I have to say this to somebody. This was a coward's deed. I changed my mind. And where I was, you cannot change your mind or tell them that you have. I tried to escape the only way I could... and brought myself darkness. But, you know, the doctors are very clever with an attempted suicide especially if he may be of further use to them and knows too much. Afterwards they brought me to stay here so that I could no longer attract attention or until they might need me again. But I'm lucky. It might have been Siberia. I understand. But it doesn't matter now. No. Not now. First, certain favors are necessary. Abdyll. This is senior organ pumper Abdyll. Say how do you do, Abdyll. Hey, how do you do? And in French. - Bonjour, madame. - Bonjour, monsieur. Not bad, huh? We taught them a“. - How many is all? - Abdyll. His mother who keeps house for us, the countess who once owned them... - Countess? - Of Valona. She's a little crazy, but has great dignity. This countess, she will come with us? There's not a chance she'd leave this place. She feels she was betraying her people. She is the last of the old Albania. The land of goats and bandits. I'd say she is a little of both. Welcome to Vosjev. May I present to you her excellency the countess of Valona. Contessa, this is my sister, Tracy, from Paris. And this is Mr. Carson from the United States of America. I trust you both had pleasant journeys. Ah, I'm happy to meet an American again. There were several of your young men here during the war. Very efficient killers of Nazis. OSS. Are you one of them, sir, back to free our country and set the old regime on its throne again? - No, madam. - Oh, this is my granddaughter. Her name is Mara. I hope your journey was not too tiring. Perhaps you would like some refreshment. You'll forgive us, countess. We haven't got a lot of time. You are wrong, Mr. Carson, in Albania there is nothing left for us but time. I give you now a toast to the freedom of our country, a health to the man who will set us free, a health to the sound of his trumpets. And that, to the death of his enemies. I guess that's to the death of mine. And now to business. You have come to take away Henri. I am his sister. Is it wrong for me to go with them, contessa? They will not say, but I'm sure they're taking me out illegally. They'll have all the Albanian security after them. Without you, they would still be shot in just the same way if they were caught. Surely it would be impolite to refuse their invitation. So much to save a traitor. No, no. Don't be so stupid. Maybe for the best intentions, but a traitor, nevertheless. Still I cannot complain. I have learned a lot here in my... my dark world. No only my mistakes but perhaps even other reasons for living. Mr. Carson, will you do an old woman a very great favor? I'll always do you one, even when you are old. Thank you. Will you take my granddaughter away with you? No, grandmother excellency, I cannot leave you. She will help you on your journey and later she will still be needed. Will you take her? For you, madam, but no one else. - Thank you. Mara. - Grandmother I... I'm very grateful. Thank you, Mr. Carson. - Thank you. - You're all welcome. And now let's go. Abdyll has already saddled four horses. I'll have him bring them 'round. You knew there'd be four needed, madam. I am an old woman, Mr. Carson, but I'm still a woman. I think I hear a car coming. You most certainly do. What shall we say to Kol Stendho now? You'll think of something. You thought of all the rest of this. Suppose he can't be brought? Then I'll have to persuade him. I don't like the way you say that. At your suggestion, sweetheart, I've double crossed the only friend I have in Albania. From now on we're playing it for keeps. Make up your mind to that. - Henri, Henri.. - Yes? That engine, not a big truck, is it? The compensations of blindness. - It's a jeep! - Keep out of sight. Get down! State security police. - I must be crazy. - What is it? I thought I saw Kol Stendho. - Kol Stendho? - Go on, get going. Wait, someone's coming after us. All of you, stay where you are. Shh! Please, sir, can you take me with you, too? - Ah, Abdyll. - Abdyll. Well, what well-equipped boat doesn't have an organ pumper? Come on. Madam, once more. Where is the blind man? The American, the French girl. I'm afraid I must ask you to leave. I shall not answer your questions. They have gone? Answer my question. They're gone? My friends in the mountains will not forget this. You're asking for a bullet... or a knife. What's the matter? I told you I'd be back. You, I suppose, are Mr. Carson? It's a pleasure to meet you at last. Speak for yourself. Come on in, Tracy, there's plenty of room. Please, Mr. Carson, you cannot catch me with an old trick like that. Who is he calling an old trick? No, no. - Did I... - With your eyes closed. Forget it. Go on, kids, get out, beat it. Boom, boom. Come on, come on. Fresh air is what you need. The children say Kol Stendho went away with the police earlier this afternoon. That explains the reception committee here, then. I knew this racket couldn't last forever. Poor, Kol. I hope he can bribe his way out of this one. What now, Carson? We try to hang around here till night comes and hope that no more cops show up. What's that? Sounds like another jeep, Mr. Carson. - Here, kids. - Hurry! Get them on the horses. Keep going, I'll be along in a minute. - I'll help you. - Oh, no, please. I'm handicapped but not infirm. - Right. - Abdyll. Go on! Go on! Oh. We heard shooting. No kidding. Well, we're cooked now. We'll never get back to the boat. Those security guards are wise to us. - But what do we do? - Well, we can't keep the horses. They'll stand out like sore thumbs on these hilltops. - Then what? - It's pretty simple, I guess. Here we are with a blind man and five kids and the Greek border is 50 miles away. Over the worst stretch of country in Europe. And that's where we've got to get to. You mean, with the children? Didn't I tell you they were perishable? - But what can we do? - We can walk, sweetheart. - We can walk. - Oh. You don't keep up, you little creeps I'll leave you all behind, do you hear that? You know something? I believe you would. Stick around, you'll see. - What are they laughing at? - They say you're so funny. But so nice. Boom. Boom. - What's the matter with him? - He's a little boy and he's tired. - Okay. - Is there another bridge? - No, not for miles. We could climb up these rocks - and get down the other side. - No. Well, don't worry about the children. They can climb anything. No I said. Go and talk to him. Seems to be all right. - Do you understand Albanian? - A little. I think it's all right for us to pass, too. Have you any papers? Who would be doing this if we had papers? Any papers, as long as they're in print. Yeah, I have a bill. A receipt from Galerie Lafayette. Very impressive. Keep pointing to the rubber stamp. I'll tell them we're a distinguished group of Bulgarian Communists. You know something, we're beginning to look it. Come on, kids. Mara, tell him not to answer the phone! Quick, off the road! Run for the hills! This will do fine. I'll get the children to... - Boom, boom! - Shut him up. - Boom, boom! - Strangle him or anything, - but shut him up. - Leave him alone. Don't you know he's hungry? So am I. I'll go see if I can steal some food. That will not be necessary. My wife and I, we did see you coming. She will have food ready in one or two minutes. Oh... Twenty years, between Piccadilly and Cambridge Circus. You sure you've never seen my restaurant? Sure, sure, whenever I go to London I always make a point of eating there. Uh-huh? Now, Malandros, that was my partner, he and I draw coin when Mussolini invade Greece. One to come back to Greek army, one to mind the business. - Carson. - Malandros, he mind the business. Carson, the children. They won't go to sleep until you say goodnight. Oh, they won't, huh? Well, we'll see about that. These children, he's the father of all of them? Well, goodnight. - That's what you say. - Oh. Uh.. And not another peep out of you, if you know what's good for you. Uh... all right. Break it up. Break it up. Uh, I don't fool anybody, do I? No, you certainly don't fool them. Tomorrow when you go, I have a good cart that you can use on your journey. And a mule. I thought it wasn't safe on the roads. You keep to the woods, the gentlemen cart on the road. Besides, nearly all the people around here are of origin of Greek blood or else in sympathy with them or else they're bandits. They all hate the Communists. - You're sure we'll be safe? - Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure as if my own sons were going with you. Well, we'll think it over. Goodnight. Goodnight. Don't put it out. I need a light. Didn't your mother ever warn you about smoking in bed? Mm. She warned me about many things. Especially hay. - Does she know you're here? - Mm.. A friend of mine sends her a post card each day from Venice. "X marks my hotel room." That sort of thing? "X marks my load of hay," you mean? Venice, is that where you gave them the slip? The police who were tailing you? No. - Switzerland. - Oh. Sometimes I almost wish they'd put the arm on you. I know, there's no way out now but I want to say I'm sorry. You'd be back in Greece but for me. Oh, I don't know. We both could have hit a rock or anything. I had no right to play poker with other people's lives. You don't think I was really bluffed into it, do you? Mm. I don't think the money had much to do with it. You don't buy that easily. Try me, you'll see how easy. Perhaps it was from my childhood that I got the idea that there is nothing you can't buy with money. Perhaps that was the trouble with Henri. He had too much from the beginning. I'd like to have that trouble for a while. Just to try it out. The way you get money seems to be the hard way. There's another method? Yeah, you can marry it. Too tough. Too, too tough. Besides, a man on the move has to travel light. I don't weigh too much, 50 kilo, 110 pounds. Stripped. I guessed it was about that at that time. And many people say I look all right, too. I must look you over properly in the morning. - Remind me. - You could do worse than me. - You think so? - And I'm quite a catch, really. With all your money, sure. Mr. Carson. Mr. Carson. Oh, what does he want now? What do you think he wants at this time of night? Mr. Carson, Mr. Carson. See what I meant about marriage being tough? Just as it gets interesting... Yes, these are the people we want. They have only one place to go now. To the Greek border and to us. It's only a matter of time. I'm very grateful. Just drop into my restaurant once in a while. See if you can find me there. I hope to come soon. Thank you. All aboard, kids, alley-oop. Let's get a move on. Wait a minute. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. All right, get aboard. March! On your way! ♪ La-la la-la la-la-la la-la la-la la-la ♪ ♪ La-la la-la la-la-la la-la la-la la-la ♪ - Boom. - Boom, boom. Oh. Oh. Good boy. ♪ La-la la-la la-la ♪ You wanna say something funny? Not a thing. I mean, now you're angry with me. I keep forgetting dames are like children, too. - Carson! - Yeah? Carson! It's the mule! It's gone lame! So what? You want me to carry him, too? - Ah! - Get 'em all out. Mr. Carson. - Shepherds. - Uh-huh. You think they'll be all right? Oh, yes. Shepherds are quite used to travelers. Until tonight I always thought Albanian cooking was distinctive the worst in Europe, but now... I'd like to give them something. If he won't take any money ask him if he'd like some cigarettes. He says he's a Muslim. It's against his religion. Tell him we love him. Tell him he's a great man. Don't do that. Mara, tell him not to shoot. It's a pleasure again, Mr. Carson. Only this time it's going to be different. Take them away. Take this man away and shoot him. No, no. You cannot do that. It is not his fault! - Get out of here! - Mara! Take him in there. The shepherd is proud that they will shoot him. It will show his friends that they were not the ones who betrayed us. My side pocket, cigarettes. Show 'em what you're doing first. No matter who they are, as long as they're men you win 'em over. I don't think he can help much. It's the man in black who seems to be in charge. Don't think this is the only country. I suppose I was never meant to be a heroine. Any idea what they're going to do with us? No. And I'm responsible... not just for you, but for the lives of all these children. You've had too much sun. No. It's the children. I know how much they mean to you even if you won't admit it. Oh, forget it, Tracy. It's first time you called me by my name. You know that? Oh, I've called you lots of names. Tell me. And you can tell me 'cause it's too late now. If we'd have got away, would you ever have called me "Mrs. Carson"? Look, do I look like the marrying... Pretty bloody good ambush, huh? Jolly much on the ball, what? Trifon is here. - Glad to meet - Glad to meet. You speak English. Uh, yes, I speak a little English, a little American, a little French, little German, little Italian. - How you do? - Fine. Tracy, Tracy! Is everybody all right? Everybody dead, very nice, what? - This one a English, too? - He's my brother. Ah. And this one, spouse-ito? Husband? Oh, no, no. Can somebody find the key? A guy in a black suit has it. The man called you captain. Is this the army or what? My army. Pretty fine army. Pretty fine captain, too, huh? Captain Trifon. You like the way I look, huh? Hm, I have not seen many quite like you, I admit. You quite like me? I quite like you. Yes, I can see you do. Jolly much on the ball, what? My sergeant, he say we go now. - Better now, what? - Jolly much on the ball. - You ride with me on horse. - No, thank you. Yes, please. You on horse. No, no. This is father of Trifon. Zante. He pretty big chief. You think, yes? - Well, I think yes. - Ah, Katina. My schwester. Uh, sister. She pretty big sister, huh? She will find for you costume more, uh, suitable. Here, they're kinda sensitive who wears the pants around here, that's all. I'd love to see you in a skirt... - Mademoiselle. - Pardon, you say? Uh, this is for you to sleep. Hey, just a minute. This isn't where you live, by any chance? No, no, no, no, this is residency of chief, my father. House of honor. I sleep this way this house with all other men. - All other men. - Sure, suits me fine. It'll be good having somebody else playing nurse-maid for a change. Hey, when you're quite finished with Ms. Albania of 1960 do you think you could spare the boy to look after me? Sure, and it looks like you're gonna need a little looking after, too. Trifon is here. Listen, Trifon, I don't know the Italian for "go away, “ but you must understand what I mean some of the time. Oh, yes, I understand, uh, a little English, a little German, little French, little Italian. Little women, too. Tres jolie is French. - You French, huh? - Oui. - Warm kiss, you like... - No like! I liked. What was all that about? I tell her to keep friendly with, uh, your brother not with the big man. Then we can all live here happily after ever uh, ever after. We do what? ♪ In my arms I hold you ♪ In your arms you do not! Listen, Trifon, will you go away like a good boy before I call for help? Why you want, uh, help? Trifon is here for your help. Look, now, if a lady should ever ask an officer... Ah! An officer! Si, sí, sí. Like we have at here many during wars. - English, Americano, yes. - Yes, yes, but... You like my uniform, huh? Britches Italian officer. Glass eye, German officer, Helmun Schmidt, I strangled him. Jacket-o, American officer. Captain Gregory, my friend of mine, belonging to him but one day, bang, he was dead. So, need no uniform. Now, your Captain Gregory, if I had asked him, an officer, to leave... Ah, you want for to undress. Oui! Yes! Si! Ah, sí, sí, sí. Yeah. But you need not for worry at all. Trifon is not shy. No. Ah! No! No! Come, sit down. Oh. Bed time for you, Andreas. Why do you men always stick together? - The woman is always the heavy. - Some heavy. Don't you want to dance with me? Ah, the music doesn't send me. Probably later. It's lucky I can sit down. I'm black and blue. Not Trifon, that well-known officer and gentleman. I make sure. I hold his hand all the time. Always so much trouble in the world. Oh, that's from Carson? Carson, the peacemaker. Anything for the quiet life, that's me. He only wants to say goodnight. At least he has good manners. Ah! Trifon is here. You very happy, I know. Have some more wine, huh? No, and I think you've had enough, too. No, no, Trifon is never enough. You like, we make some more dance. Once bitten, twice shy. Oh, you're shy. Why? - Trifon is never shy. - No, you're not. Look at my sister. She never shy also. She all over your brother very much. Quite a family, but you better tell her my brother is spoken for. Oui? Never mind, capitan, let it ride. Oh, I'm glad you liking riding of horses. Here we will also ride when we are married together. Trifon, a joke's a joke, but... Why Will you always joke for me whenever I could be more serious? This is why I'm now here. Pardonne moi. - How many goats, huh? - Goats? How many goats or sheep your father has? Huh? My father has 2,000 sheep and many, many goats. All will be mine. And what is mine is yours. Ah, you mean my dowry. Oh, listen, Trifon, for once in your life, be your age! It's not possible for you to love me. But I love you. I love you very much. But don't be such a fool. I don't love you... - Ah! - Nice warm kiss. But not from you. You help next time, huh? There's no next time. Oh, Carson, help me. Do something. Oh! Oh, with all his army standing around? Oh, no, not me. All right, all the boy needs is a little cooperation. - Ah. - Nice warm kiss, huh? - This time she help, huh? - You want to try again? - Get away from her! - Oh... - Nice warm kiss. - Uh... Trifon. You are lucky. Father says you are guest in our house. Otherwise I kill you. Without your head? What did I say? Carson, the peacemaker. Father say no more kissing, only, uh.., dancing. Glad to meet. Yes, I know, I know. Trifon is here. - Last night, uh, too bad, uh? - Too bad. You like Carson better, not me, uh? Why do you ask? His gun taken away, mine not. What are you trying to say? You sure want your brother in Greece, safe, and children safe also? Very much I do. Then you stay with me, no? Oh, no. Then nobody go. Too bad. But even if I say yes, Carson would never agree. Carson, he do not know. You do not tell him. You come with all to border and on border you say you... you stay with Trifon, you want Trifon. You will find Trifon very loving. You think I would do this? If you give word of honor like... like officer, yes. - It is finality. - Finality. That is the word, yes. Otherwise nobody go. All right, Trifon, I will stay. You swear like officer? I swear like officer. I trust you... almost. Understand? Oui. I understand. Expected soldiers, maybe, but not 40 to 50 member. - Where are we, anyway? - No man's land. Here, normal crossing place to Greek border. Greek border may be one mile that way. Only, we've got no passports. Ah! With Trifon, nobody need no passport. Higher up mountain is once small frontier post. Three to four men likely to, uh, sleeping there. Bang! They continue to sleeping. Ah. All right, you give me a few of your men I'll take care of the frontier post up there and get our party through. You and the rest make a surprise diversion down here the minute we start shooting. Pretty good plan. Only one thing wrong. - I coming with your party. - You're the doctor. No, no, I'm the captain. Only where you all go, uh, I go also. You said there'd be only three or four. How do we get past them? Did not expect. Up by the ledge. One man might climb, but not blind man, two women and several of children. And the Greek frontier? Still a half mile so as not to have shooting always between Greek and Albanians. Makes crossing much difficult also. They'll be changing sentries pretty soon. While they're doing that, we can open up and take care of most of them. Pretty good officer, huh? Never give up. Like my friend of mine, Captain Gregory. Long as you don't end up wearing my clothes, too. I thought you told them not to start shooting until after we did. And look what it's done there. What is going on? Isn't that your surprise party? Sure, and they surprised me fine. What do they think they're at, in charge of the light brigade? - Looks like they've been waiting for us. - Maybe. And we haven't got all night to stand around. Trifon... any of your men, a good mountaineer maybe, do you think he could crawl along on top and drop some grenades among them? And for why? Because there are six of us here and ten of them there and they're attacking with a couple of machine guns that's about why. I think we go home instead. I think we don't. So got anymore funny suggestions? You want for me to go climbing these mountains to breaking my neck, huh? Trifon, perhaps, not good with reading of books but, uh, stupido, no, no, no, no. Will you give me some grenades and let me do it? Pretty good idea. Oh, no, no, don't, Carson, you are not a mountaineer. What do we do then? Stay here? We can go home. You, you are not an officer. You said when I promised that you would... What did you promise? What did she promise? She promised she go home with Trifon. You and the others cross border to Greece. Oh, you idiot. Another night, you will go. Trifon keep promise. You too, I trust you. Gimme the rest of the grenades. No. Don't, Carson. Don't even try. I tell you it's no good, please. Please. Anybody who can make a crazy gesture like that, what else can I do now? So, all I have to remember is to not look down. Trifon, if you ever see me again, and you will, you'd better duck. - Carson? - Uh-huh? You know you are being blackmailed into this, don't... Sure, sure, like you blackmailed me into coming along for the ride? Only, I like the way you do business better. Check that for me, will you? You don't need a ticket for that. You think you'll remember my face? I think I'll remember. But why doesn't he go on? What happened? Has the battle stopped down there? Lots of fires. Men running about. But no shooting. No more trouble now. Soon, no more machine guns also. Makes crossing easy possible. Now you come home with me. Go home with you? A man who breaks his word and pretends to be an officer? He leaves a brave man to die alone. You have to kill me first. You say that to me? I am better man. More brave, better officer. Then prove it to me. Trifon prove, you'll see. What's that? Careful! Oh, Trifon. Machine gun knock me. - Don't talk. - But I knock him back. - No more machine gun, huh? - Shh, be quiet. Also, no more Trifon. Get him some water, Mara. My glass eye, please. No, no. He mustn't drink anything. Thanks, Trifon, for what you did. - Pretty good officer, yes? - The best. No. It's no good, huh? Uh, Trifon no good no more. She stay, she not to leave me. I don't leave you. I stay as long as you want. Give me some water, Mara. - No joke? - No joke. For you. That's quite a gesture. That machine gun, I knock him. - You knocked him. - What? - Pretty bloody good ambush. - Sure, sure. I knock him. Bang, I... Oh... Mara... tell his men to take care of him. This they will do. And they're to tell his father that his son was a very brave man. - This they will also do. - An officer. Come on, we've got to get across before it's daylight. Just a few more seconds and then you're a free man once again. You make it sound like a divorce lawyer consoling his client. You seem surprised, Mr. Carson. Well, this is just a small deception which has been very profitable for us. Come with me. There, for your information, is the Greek frontier. All this here is no man's land. For my own part, I would shoot you here now, for you have caused severe trouble for my men. But we have orders to take you to our superior officer. So. Please. I should have guessed. Name? Brown. Your name is Carson. Nationality? - Hot 'n' tot. - You are an American. What are you doing in Albania? Tourist passing through. Now answer my question more politely, please. Time is short. Your boat will be back here soon as it has been each day at this time awaiting your signal. - Now you will give it. - I'm not in the mood, pal. - I shall put you in the mood. - I've been beaten up before. The children have not. Mike won't bring that boat in unless he sees all of us waiting. This has been arranged already. Shondaw, go outside and see if there are any signs of the boat. - The men are already watching. - I want no mistakes. - Watch with them. - Yes, comrade commandant. Quite the NKVD boy, aren't you? You have forced me to be. I warned you this Mallambert was dangerous yet you bring him away. But if I'm all you want, why can't you keep me and... Ah, it's no use anyway. I'll confess anything you want. - The usual thing. - It is too late. You and your friends have attracted too much attention. Too many men have died. But to dispose of all of us and the children... Who said I intend to dispose of the children or you for that matter? There is still a chance and I am still your friend. It will be dangerous. But I think you have met danger several times already. Outside are ten men and my officer. We have to convince them that I'm not helping you that I have never helped you. Sure. We'd be delighted to save your job for you. Look outside. Your family seems to have grown. That's the way families usually are, I guess. There's a couple of kids there I never... You mean they're yours? Their mother died five years ago. And I would like them to have another life than this. All right. Now we do this. Go down on the beach as if you were be calling the boat in. I shall be covering you with this. And at the last minute I jump ya. How much time will that give us? My men would be a little way away. That's why there will be a vital few moments of confusion, after that... Well, it sounds okay on paper. But what if there's a hitch? There must be no hitch. Come on. Well, you think your people are gonna be far enough away not to see what's going on? We should have 20, may be 30 seconds before they understand. Keep your hands up! Put them on the rail! Keep them there. And you, too, please, comrade commandant. - So drop that gun. - Have you gone mad? Drop that gun. What do you think you're doing? I am in command here. No, I am in command here now. So drop that gun. My superior officer will be pleased to confirm the promotion when I report the conversation I've just overheard. Ah. Now we'll be able to proceed as you originally planned. But this time there'll be no hitch. Drop your hands and turn around. Turn around. But the children, what will happen to them? That depends on your behavior. Ah. May I say something to them? - You have exactly 60 seconds. - Ah. I wish I could say what I want, if only goodbye. Will someone tell me the word for goodbye? Try and tell 'em antic. Antío. Listen, children. I know it's difficult for you to understand what I'm trying to say. You see, the only word I know is antic. Antío. Yes. Antío. In a few moments we have to go away. But one day you will be safe home again. Try to believe that, try to understand. I, Abdyll will tell them. Oh, yes. I forgot you spoke English. You tell them, huh? Now antic. Children. - Boom, boom. - Oh. Andreas. That is the nicest present I ever had. Goodbye to you, my darling. Captain, are you all right? No, Mike, he's got us all covered! The kids, too! That was intelligent of you. The rest of you keep still while I get my men down. I wouldn't move if I were you either. - You'll never succeed. - You don't mind if I try, do you? Just keep that gun lowered. Kol, get the kids on board. - Yes. - Hey. Get the machine gun ready for me and keep your engines running. Aye-aye, captain. Just take it easy, buster, for another half a minute. Kol, you take over. Throw me down a machine gun. Get away, Mike, get away! Turn. - More comfortable now? - Yes, very much. Kol, your kids are asking for you. You better show 'em you're all right. I will. Thank you, mademoiselle. I thought I told you to change your clothes. After all you've been through do you want to die from pneumonia? Look, why don't you relax, Florence Nightingale? Yeah, now we both get pneumonia. It's wonderful. - Carson? - Oui? Are you sure you're still the man on the move? - Still travelling light? - Uh-huh. But it's getting heavier all the time. Oh, no. You see, marriage, families, trouble. But, you know, I like trouble. Well, that's with just one of them. Guess what it'll be like with a large family? - Mm. But I like large families. - You do? Hm, very large. You know something? You might easily end up with one.
