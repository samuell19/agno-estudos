Your birthday gift is too much. How much is this? Never mind, babe. Just bring it to the club house tomorrow. We're going to have so much fun. Aye, wait... We'll just have dinner. See you tomorrow, Hon! Happy birthday! Uh, okay. Bye. What? Nothing. Can you set up my phone? And... Can you install some apps on it? What kind of apps? The important ones only. No social media. No Facebook. No Instagram. And, also no Twitter. How can your father get an update from you? I can use Skype. Is it because of what happened before? Okay, mom. I will take a rest. Take care, Mom! Love you! Sorry! It's traffic. If it wasn't your birthday... Anyway... Happy birthday! Whoo! Smile! 3..2..1! Wow! Send me the pictures after you get home. I'll be the one to choose! Don't delete.

Edit this one immediately. Upload it by tonight, okay? - Alright! - Don't forget the logo of our sponsor! Babe! What the heck! I was waiting all night and... Why can't I contact you? I lost the phone that you gave me. What!? -I lost the phone that you gave me. -I heard what you said! You said what so I thought, you didn't hear the... Sorry. That's all you can say!? I'll just pay for it. Wow! Money is not the issue! But, it's my birthday gift to you. Oh, your birthday was last Saturday. -Belated! -Belated! Thank you! Hey! We’re not yet done! Look. I think we need space. Let's cool off! Is it just because of the phone? It's not just the phone! It's the pictures. In fact... those aren't just pictures! They're memories! Memories of us together! You're the only one in the pictures. What? Nothing. One of the apps that I downloaded on your phone is the 'Store box'. As long as your phone is connected to the internet, it will automatically back up in your Store Box all your files. Songs... Audio files... Videos, documents... Pictures? Pictures. Even if... Example... it's already deleted on the phone? Yes! So, all of Jasmin's pictures... You can see on your 'Store Box' account. And, if... Example... Your phone got snatched. And, the person who snatched your phone likes taking selfies.. And... he connected to the internet. The pictures will be uploaded to Storebox. Yes! So, we will see his face! You can show it to the police. Jasmin's pictures are all I want. Oh, here. Download complete. Your username is... karter_calma Your password is... Your birthday. Why are there no new files? Did you ever connect that phone to the internet? No. That's why there's none. Just check your Store Box. Every now and then. And, that person might connect to the internet. Miss! Can you take a picture of us? Just click the circle on the screen. I know how to use it. I had this one before. 1... 2… 3... Smile! Thank you! Miss! I think I saw you before! I'm not Pia Wurtzbach! Joke! Anyway, we have Wi-Fi here and the password is... God is watching us. No space. All capital letters! Don't forget to tell them that! God is watching us. No space. All capital letters. -Enzo, can you hear me? -Yes. I got my salary that's why I bought you cream of mushroom chicken... And, ginilo. Yay! It's really delicious. Hello? Hello, your signal is choppy. Not chubby, choppy. -Let's talk later. Bye! - Miss, 2,500 pesos only. I already have a cellphone. Does it have a camera? Change your phone. 1,500 pesos only. The reason why you'er selling this is because it's already damaged. Come on, Miss. Just buy it! Babe. Oh, you're already here, babe. I bought ginilo. Give me some. And, also babe... I bought a phone with camera. Really? It's really cheap. I also bought a charger. Let me see. Let me see. Babe, who's this? I think this is the owner before it got snatched. I think, babe... The owner left it... and then the seller took it. What an imagination you have! You know, what's this? This is stolen. -Babe, stop it. - Just smile. Babe, stop it! Stop it! - Come on! Just one more! - I said, stop it! Take a picture of me instead. Okay! Let me see if you're handsome. This one. Oh, this one! You look stupid! God is watching us No space and all capital letters. Thank you! Tricia, take your lunch early while we still have few customers. I'm not hungry yet. Can I connect to your Wi-Fi? That's it. Right? This is okay for our next episode. I know someone who can be our guest. -Really? -I can handle the next episode. Karter! Did you already adjust the saturation of the clips? I'm almost done, Digs. Okay. I have to go, guys. I still have VTR in Ortigas. -Bye! -Bye! Jasmin! Jasmin! I already retrieved all your pictures. How? -There's a back up online. -Oh. And the phone? You said that it's not about the phone? Look. Karter... I've been thinking and... I realized that... I wanna reserve myself for someone better. What... is wrong with me? There's nothing wrong. More of... lacking? Look, you don't even have passion for our relationship. No thrill. And... No sense of adventure when I'm with you. At first... It was it's so refreshing to be with a guy who's low profile and no signs vanity. But... I don't know. It feels stale, eventually. Why I have never experienced that.. viral version of you which I've watched before? You courted me. FYI! Damn you snatcher! You're even using my phone for a selfie! Damn you! Babe! Are you there? Trisha! At last, you're home! Auntie Marisa? Enzo doesn't want to leave unless he tells you in person. Leaving? Babe! I'll be staying in Gapan. -She arrived... -He miss... We already miss, Lorenzo. Thank you so much! For taking care of him. I'll just wait you downstairs. Okay. Aren't you coming down? You're leaving me? You didn't even say goodbye in advance? It's so sudden. Why are you sad? I will lose a nurse and a maid. No one will cook for me anymore. No one will clean the kitchen. No one will wash my underwear. Let's email. At least, I can use a computer there. I'll e-mail you the pictures later, okay? Send me some of your pictures. So, I won't miss you so much. You can also send videos if you like. Karter! They're asking if we already broke up. We thought you guys just cooled off. Yes, we broke up. Since yesterday. Make sure your break up won't affect our work. No, it won’t. Right, Karter? Don't forget to pull the plugs, okay? I'll go ahead. Okay. Hi, babe! Babe, how are you? I'm still working. I hope you're doing good there, babe. Just tell me if you need anything. Okay? Do you want me... to dance? (Dancing...) Hi, babe! I can't endorse that restaurant because I'm a vegetarian. So, what are we going to do? They are the sponsors for this episode. It's not like we're endorsing the slaughter of animals here. You'll just mention the name of the restaurant and thank the sponsors of this episode. That's it! You know what? I am so done with this channel. There's so many other things I could be doing, instead of what you're making me do. And, also... I forbid you to use my likeness for this episode. You can shoot using another host. But, not me. (Inaudible...) -Devil! -Let her be! Let's shoot the episode again. Karter! Get ready! You'll be hosting! -Come on! -What? Why me? You're the best looking person in the room. Unlike us! No! Just wait! I can't still... I can't do it! The people will bash our channel! Believe me! Don't you think by this time, they've already forgotten "Boy Basted". And besides, our channel has lots of bashers, anyway. Okay! Is there anyone who has a friend that can host? As in right now?! We're wasting time here, guys! And, there you have it! Don't forget to hit the subscribe button for more funny videos. This is Restie Serano. Miss U! And... cut! Okay, snack time! Come on, Restie! Karter, let's go! I'm not yet hungry. - You can go. -You want me to buy you something? Nothing. Okay. Thank you! Hi, babe! How are you doing? Are you doing good? I hope someone is taking care of you. Just tell me, if you want me to take care of you again. I'm good with that. I gotta go. Because they might think that I'm pooping. Okay, I really have to go. Bye bye! I love you! What is this about, anyway?! We're in the middle of the year and yet, we still have Christmas decorations. Conrad! Conrad! Lea You shout too loud! Can you please buy other decorations? -On Saturday. -Okay! You have to buy on Saturday. Okay! Trisha? -Trisha! -Yes? You can go home now. We can handle this. No, I can help you guys. You just want to use the Wi-Fi. Don't you have internet in your apartment? We don't. You know what? You can use your data, they have an unlimited promo data. Right? Yeah, you can use that unlimited promo. It's not in my budget. Hi, babe! How are you? Hey! You know what? My boss gave me extra money for my load so that I can register on Unli-Net. So that I can send you an email even though I'm in the apartment. See? I really miss my mom and dad. And I miss you so much too. I also want to say thank you. Because you accepted me for who I am. I think you're my partner in life. You're really my soulmate. You take care of yourself, okay? And then if you're okay, let's go on a fieldtrip. Let's go to Corregidor. We've been wanting to go there but it doesn't push through. Bye bye. Love you. Since when did Jasmine call you Ben? No, it's not Jasmine. Come here! I'll show you something. My smartphone is still connected to my Storebox account, right? Yes. She has it. Finally, I saw her face. But she looks like... a bit cheap. No! She's cool. Here, look at her other video. Brother. Are you in love with that girl? You're so exaggerated! I'm just happy to see her because she looks so innocent. Plus points because she's so cute. Then, she's very hardworking. Like everyday she goes to... You said so many things. Okay. Fine! I like her! Do you want to find her? I can start a Facebook campaign. Someone could identify her. Do you want to ruin her privacy? Aren't you invading privacy by snooping through her files? Is it possible to look for her in person? Are you serious? Kate. Please help me find her. I promise, if I finally see her in person, I will delete my Storebox account. Please. Does your printer have ink? Our objective is to deduce the possible whereabouts of that girl using information found in her files. Maybe we can sort it out by ticking on the pictures that don't have important information. The close up selfies? Full face? No, not yet. Is it safe to assume that she's a waitress? Yeah, maybe. In one restaurant that serves... What do you call to this one? Pancit Palabok? -Pancit Malabon? -Pancit Luglog Pancit that has an orange sauce and thick noodles. There are so many restaurant that serves that in the Philippines. How can we identify? I think this is what the restaurant looks like. The name of the place is just not included in the frame. There's too many similar to that. Even in Metro Manila only. Bingo! Read the poster. Maricel Morales for Councilor. Check Maricel Morales on Google. Find out where she ran as a councilor. Okay. Okay. Here, according to the website of the COMELEC, she ran as a councilor in Angeles City, Pampanga. There you go. Conclusion. That girl is a gaudy waitress. But in fairness, she's pretty. She works in a restaurant in Angeles who serves pancit with orange sauce. Okay. Let's go to Angeles. But... There's a chance that the restaurant is not located there. I know. (Phone ringing...) Babe. I can no longer lie to you. The reason I went home to Gapan, is because Thea went home from Macau. Huh? What? What about us? We knew this would happen. I thought... your relationship was already on the rocks? I love you, babe. You know that. Yes, I know. Okay. Delete all of my emails to you. She might catch you. You can also delete my number on your cellphone. Okay. Okay. I won't contact you in the mean time... For you to be safe. Always take care of yourself, okay? I love you. This is such a big city. What street do you want to start? The closest city. Oh, here. Santo Rosario. Oh, wait. The restaurant's door has Christmas decor. -So, let's check it out. -Okay. Sir, do you know where this is? I don't know, sir. You saw it? Do I look like I've achieved anything? What are you looking at on your laptop? Weird. There's no new file since last night. This is an impossible task. The day's ending and yet, we only went to a few places. What's on my mind? It is more like who's on your mind. I'm done. Hey. What's with you?! It's so dirty here in Angeles because trash is thrown everywhere! Throw this in the trash can! Annoying! Environmentalist. Okay. I kinda like her now. Boss, I'll do that. I thought you're not coming to work? Better than sulking at home. Don't worry, you don't have to pay for me today. Are you okay? Okay. The password of our Wi-Fi is God is watching us, no spaces and all in capital letters. Okay. You said you passed by this street! I didn't know they removed the door's Christmas decor. Come on! Let's go! What's your next move? Miss. Menu. Tricia, menu please. Tricia... Menu, table no. 5. What's your order? Hey! Uhm... Just pancit. Two, please. Guisado? Palabok? Luglog? Canton? Malabon? Bihon? Uhm... The one with orange sauce and thick noodles. Luglog? Is it tasty? Why would I say otherwise? Ah, okay. That's all. Just two. Drinks? -Just water. -Mineral? Service water only. Okay. So grumpy. Not so cool after all. She wouldn't even look at her own customer. She's very different from her videos and pictures. (Crying...) Why did you still come to work? Miss. Tell her to go home so she can rest. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. What happened to you? Nothing, just don't mind me. It's just a small problem. Small? You look like you lost someone with your behavior! Hey, Conrad! The orders of the customers. Here's your order. The password of our Wi-Fi is God is watching us, no space all capital. You can get the water at the counter. Ma'am. What happened to your waitress? We heard her crying. Heart problems. Heart attack? Not heart attack. I mean, love life! So she's going through something. We are so quick to judge. What happened to her and to her boyfriend? They broke up? She caught him cheating? He died? -Boss, I'll go home. -Take care, okay? Take a rest. You pay them first. What are you doing? I need to follow her. What? What?! Are you going to follow her until she reaches her house? No way! Besides, this pancit is so yummy. Ma'am, are you open tomorrow? We are closed every Sunday. Until what time are you open on weekdays? Until 9:00 pm. ♪ Sorry, my love. ♪ ♪ This won't take long. ♪ ♪ I just want you to hear what's inside ♪ ♪ my heart I'm offering you ♪ ♪ I hope you hear what my song says ♪ ♪ Even if I force myself to stay away ♪ ♪ and look the other way ♪ ♪ I can't forget the smell ♪ ♪ brought by the winds ♪ ♪ The first time I saw ♪ ♪ you, I can't believe ♪ ♪ It's like a dream, ♪ ♪ heaven is what I feel ♪ ♪ I want you to know that ♪ ♪ you're the one I love ♪ ♪ I hope you hear what my heart beats for ♪ ♪ I want you to know ♪ ♪ you're in my dreams ♪ ♪ Get our different worlds closer ♪ ♪ My heart longs for your love ♪ ♪ I won't forget the ♪ ♪ love and joy you bring ♪ ♪ If you can bring it back ♪ ♪ what you felt before ♪ ♪ for my longing heart ♪ I just fell in love! This is all your fault. It is all your fault, Tricia. You're stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. You knew what you get yourself into! You're now alone drinking ginilo! Bro, what are you doing? Is it safe to conclude that she loves purple? Is it safe to conclude that you have plans to go back to Angeles tomorrow? After my work. I'm not going with you to see that girl. Her name is Tricia. She mentioned it on her latest video. Wait. You said that you'll delete your Storebox account when you meet her in person. Later when I get home. Buy it, sir. It has 50% discount. 50% discount? Good to know. There's a stitch on her butt. What are you looking for, sir? The cheapest one that can connect to the internet. How much megapixel you want in a camera? It's not important. I need a phone that has a huge storage capacity. Are you already closed? It's only 7:30 pm. Because there's no customers. Hey, boy! There are many open restaurants in Poblacion, you can go there. Why are telling to him to go to our rivals? -The kid is hungry. -Are you sure? Tricia went home already? Yes, why? Nothing. Are you Tricia's boyfriend? Ah, no! Frien... Just an acquaintance. Okay, next time. Panti. Panti. Do you think I'm a flirt? Yeah, I know. Jasmine and I have just broken up. But, still... we never had a connection for so long. So, even though we broke up recently... My heart has been vacant for a long time. Hey! I'm not a fuckboy. I'll give you to the less fortunate. Yeah, whatever. Tricia! There's a package for you. Huh? From whom? I don't know, just look at the paper bag. Just finish what you're doing. Customers are swarming in. Okay, sure. (Don't be sad, please?) Hello. Hello. You're not sad anymore? Who are you? (Phone ringing...) Is this Enzo? No. Who is this? Miss, I will have the one I ordered before. Which one? Sorry, because we have many customers here. I can't remember it all. Pancit luglog. Pancit luglog... Drinks? -Iced Tea, plus ice. -Okay. The password of our Wi-Fi here is God is watching us, no space and all capital. Miss! Are you okay now? What? I heard you crying in the kitchen last time. Pancit luglog and Iced tea. (Thank you for the doll.) (But if you don't introduce yourself, I will throw this away tomorrow.) Pancit luglog and Iced tea. Enjoy your meal. Miss. Nothing. Thank you. So, you're just assuming that she likes you. How do you even know? I just feel it. If you're confident that she likes you. What are you still looking for? I just wanna make a good impression. Is it safe to conclude that she really likes ref magnets? Miss? Bill out, please. Total of 130 pesos. Keep the change. Anyway... You can have these. What is this? Ref magnets. I won those from a raffle. But, there's not enough space on my refrigerator. Why are you giving me these things? Aren't you into ref magnets? I'll be giving these to my boss, she will like it for sure. (Singing...) Pansit luglog again, sir? Wow! You finally remember me. Of course, you’re here everyday. Are you not getting tired? Anyway, thank you for the refrigerator magnets. My boss said. No problem. Anyway, did you already throw out Panti Panti? Of course not. Why would I throw it out? It was given by... What happened? Boss. One pancit luglog. What happened to you? You look like you're having an asthma attack.. Nothing. Why are you not answering my texts and calls? You put your number on the card, but you don't want to talk! You think you're handsome? Look at your head, it's not even proportionate to your body. I'll go ahead. Trisha. You even know my name, huh? You creep me out. I just heard what your boss calls you. I'm Karter by the way. Trisha. Why are you here? Are you waiting for someone? Can I invite you to get ginilo drinks? Are you playing with me? Don't you like ginilo? So, you didn't throw Panti Panti yet? Why would I even throw it out? You said if I did not introduce myself, -you'll throw it away. -Here. You know what? I think I've seen you somewhere. I was the one you scolded for littering. So that was you. But no, except that. Maybe, someone I look like. Why were you crying last time? Why are you so concerned when I cried? It's over. I'm sure it wasn't the only time you cried. Let me guess, you loved someone then, he left you. You know what's more painful? You already knew what you got yourself into from the start. You knew your relationship won't work. But then... YOLO. What's important is, you are happy in the present. Don't mind it until it gets complicated. Do you have ESP? Why is it like you know what's happening in my life? I just feel it. So, am I correct? You know what, when Enzo was courting me. I already knew that he had a girlfriend in Macau. She's Thea. However, he said their relationship was on the rocks. On the rocks? As in? As in, they will break anytime soon. Maybe... But then, I still took the chance. Didn't you make him choose? Like leaving Thea first before being together. No, because I knew he wouldn't choose me. Also because I knew they were not falling apart. But you love him that's why you just justify it. It reminds me of a song. ♪ Sorry, my love. ♪ ♪ This won't take long ♪ ♪ I just want you to ♪ ♪ hear what's inside ♪ ♪ my heart I'm offering you ♪ ♪ I hope you hear what my song says ♪ Are you okay? ♪ Even if I force myself to stay away ♪ ♪ and look the other way ♪ ♪ I can't forget the smell ♪ ♪ brought by the winds ♪ ♪ The first time I saw ♪ ♪ you, I can't believe ♪ ♪ It's like a dream, ♪ ♪ heaven is what I feel ♪ ♪ I want you to know that ♪ ♪ you're the one I love ♪ ♪ I hope you hear what ♪ ♪ my heart beats for ♪ ♪ I want you to know you're in my dreams ♪ ♪ Get our different worlds closer ♪ ♪ -My heart longs for your love ♪ ♪ -I hope you listen ♪ ♪ -I won't forget the love and joy you bring ♪ ♪ -what I feel inside ♪ ♪ -If you can bring it back ♪ ♪ -don't hesitate ♪ ♪ -what you felt before for my longing heart ♪ ♪ -what you felt before for my longing heart ♪ Whoo! Thank you. I rarely go out of my house. Usually, after work, I go straight home to my apartment. But next time, I'll treat you out when payday comes. There's a next time? Of course! If that's okay with you? Got an idea! I will cook you my specialty. What's your specialty? Secret. Surprise. I hope it's cream of mushroom chicken. Why? Gosh, I'm having a goosebumps. Why? Because my specialty is cream of mushroom chicken. How did you know? I didn't know, I just told you my favorite dish. You know what, he's so weird. First, he bought me a lot of refrigerator magnets. We both like ginilo. Then, he really knows my issues about love. He also memorized my favorite rap song. But wait, there’s more. Cream of mushroom chicken is also his favorite. Do you believe in soulmates, Panti Panti? Right? And why do you think he gave me a purple doll, when my favorite is purple? You know what, you're right. Maybe, all of it was just coincidental. But, no. I feel like, there's something more. It happened consecutively. It really felt like we have a... connection. And, he's really cute. Then, he has these deep dimples whenever he smiles. And he always smells like a baby! Big bro, when will we put this all down? Not yet. Why does it look like there's more pictures now? Don't tell me, your StoreBox is still connected to her phone. Well, technically, it's my phone. Besides, I'm sure most of her pictures and videos are posted on social media. How do you know? You haven't been on social media for like the past three years. Mind your own business! Trisha makes me happy and I think I make her happy too. That's your status now? Just when did you guys meet? It's not important. Other people have known each other for a long time, but they don't connect like we do. With Trisha, I can really feel the connection. Of course, there's a connection. You have StoreBox. Anyways, it's your life, big bro. Goodnight. Our password is, God is watching us, no space all capital letters. She seems so happy today. She was so sad just the other day. Maybe, she's getting crazy. Maybe, she reconciled with her boyfriend. Oh no! I forgot I'm cooking something. -Trisha? -Yes? Did you reconcile with your boyfriend? But, we didn't fight, we just broke up. Broke up? You're okay with that? Well, that's the way it is. But, just like what they say when a door shuts, there's another that will open. Good afternoon, sir, welcome! Hey, you're also wearing blue green. Oh, yeah! So, how is he? Who? You! Oh, yeah, I'm good. You want pancit luglog? No, just Iced Tea. I don't want to be full. I'm planning to ask you out for dinner. Are you free? Where? -Wherever you want. -Trisha -Table 2 is asking for the menu. -Coming. Okay, fine. I will let you decide where, just not the expensive ones. Okay, sure. Just tell me when you're ready to order. -Wait a minute. -Yes? Is he the one? The new door that will open? Sorry, I washed many dishes. So, where are we going? I bought this before going here. -Now, can I taste your specialty? -What? But, how? I bought all the ingredients, right? No, what I mean is where will I cook? At your apartment. How did you know I'm living in an apartment? Well, you told me, last night. Really? Okay, anyways, so what you're saying is... We will go to my apartment, then, I will cook cream of mushroom chicken. Then, we will eat it there? I hope so. Okay, fine. But, we can't make a lot of noise, because... My uncle is resting, he's a policeman. You know what, he doesn't want noise. -Uncle? -Yes. Do you want to do it, next time? Or you can bring this ingredients home. Let's just eat outside. No, let's go. My unit is here in the rooftop. Ta da! Is your uncle inside? Oh, yes, he's sleeping. You can stay here, it's hot inside. Wait here, while I cook, okay? Time to eat! -Here -It smells good! W... W... W-wait! First time. There you go. Alright, you can now eat. Hey, eat first. Let me take a picture first. There you go. What do you do with the pictures that you take? Nothing, just for memories. Memories. To commemorate what you had for dinner? Something like that. For example, you went abroad and I've come to miss you. I can look here again, to see you. You don't upload it on Facebook? I don't have a Facebook account. Okay, actually, I have one. But I haven't logged in for a long time. Why not? I don't enjoy it and the attention seekers any more. They all want to compete with each other. Who's prettier, smarter, or more virtuous. Hey. Me too. I also deactivated my Facebook account. All my social media accounts. Because? Same as your reason. We have many things in common. Actually... My uncle is not inside. I live on my own. I just scared you, because I'm afraid that you'll do something to me. You're too much! Does this face belong to someone who will do something bad? -And wait. -What? If you were doubting me... Why did you still bring me here? Because, I want to be with you. That's what you call taking chances. Just be careful, okay? Again, thank you. Bye. Bye. What are you doing? Taking chances. Tomorrow is Sunday. Are you doing something? Well, I'm planning to do the laundry. You wanna go somewhere? Where? Are you in if I say Corregidor? -Welcome to Sun Cruises. -Thank you. -Can we go now? -Let's go! -Hey, wait. -Run faster! -Thank you! -Thank you. ♪ ♪ Let's take a selfie. -Let's go! -I don't want to I'm scared. It's okay we're together. Even so. If an apparition appears I will still be able to see it. -I still don't want to. Hey, stop it. -And what if, a spirit followed you to your house. I might not be able to sleep tonight! Fine, fine, I'll stop. What are you most afraid of? This tunnel or Facebook? Afraid is different from unwilling. You're not going to log in? Ever? People might talk about me again. Okay, fine, I'm afraid. I am really afraid. I know the feeling. People think they know you so well just based on what they saw on the internet. Then, when you try to explain, it's no use. They've decided what truth they want to think about you. And if ever you try to fight back, they will not stop. If you stay silent, they will still not stop. So, you'll just leave, right? We're really soulmates, aren’t we? Even with that, we're the same. Maybe. So, when will we face our fears? I will face this first! Let's get out of here. Relax! We're close to the exit. Wait, who's that? (Scream!) -What's your problem? -Hey, stand up, face your fears. -Let's go, or you'll get left behind. -Hey, Karter! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! See? I told you, you can do it. Come on, let's go! Let's run faster, the ferry will not wait for us. Are you ready to log-in? Are you ready to reactivate your account? We'll do it together. Okay. -One, two, three! -One, two, three! Look, I have many messages on my inbox. 1,334 messages. 59,670 shares. 12 million views. What is? It came out, three years ago. For the past three months... I didn't think of anyone but you. Coreen, can you be mine? -No, Karter. Please stand up. -Baby girl, just listen to this song. Please. ♪ My baby girl Coreen, will ♪ ♪ you be my girlfriend? ♪ ♪ My baby girl Coreen ♪ -Stop this. Stop this! -♪ Will you be my girlfriend? ♪ Oh! I've seen this before! That's why you look familiar. People took videos. They uploaded it. It went viral. They found my account. They grabbed my pictures. Turned it into a meme. Had it trending. Coreen, hated me more. She didn't talk to me ever. Actually, it's okay. Turning me into a laughing stock. I just don't understand why I should be laughed at and put to shame repeatedly. Did I step on someone? Did I hurt someone? Or was it a scam I did? Fine, let's just say, what I did to Coreen was wrong. I put her under pressure when I asked her in public. But, was she serious? She wished me and my family dead just because of that? Here. This went viral 2 years ago so maybe you haven't seen it yet. Miss. Miss! Please stop bothering me, or else I will kick you. I already gave you your change. Dada! I'm not stupid! I'm educated! And I don't think you are! You're old, but you don't act like one! But, really, I gave you your change. Oh you don't understand Tagalog? I'll just say it in English. Okay, I said leave me away, alone! Leave me away, alone. They don't know what really happened. I bought a pirated CD from that old lady. I gave her 500 pesos. Suddenly, she doesn't want to give my change. She told me that she already gave it to me. But, that's not true. I'm not even senseless on that day. That's why... I took the change on that old lady's belt bag. She chased me. She insisted that she already gave me my change. Someone took a video. A memory. People created different interpretations. Then it went viral. And then people started posting hate messages on my Facebook. They were able to take my private photos from my account. I don't know how they did that. That's it! The counselor in Paete removed my scholarship. He was supposed to help me study in Manila. Didn't they listen to your side? They believed what other people said. They made a petition to remove my scholarship. So what I did was... I went to Manila. I looked for a job. I really got paranoid because of that. Because every person who looks at me... is like they know me because of the viral video. So I ended up here in Pampanga becoming a helper. You know what... This isn't right. I shouldn't have logged in. I only get hate messages here. I'll just delete my account. If you do that. They won. I don't care. Whatever! I'll just focus on my real life. As long as I can talk to my love ones. That's enough for me. Deleted. You don't have many haters, unlike mine. You're right. We should focus on the real world. Thank God I met you. Does Resti still think that he's still a boss? He works for Miss U now. This is unacceptable! Call him! Migs, I've been trying but he is unattended. Good morning! Why are you all frowning? Resti told us he can't come at the last minute. We're supposed to shoot five episodes today. I can do it. If that's okay with you guys? Okay! Rolling in five, four, three, two... Hey guys, Karter Kalma here, and you are watching Miss U! This episode is brought to you by Flappers Travel Agency. How well do you know your Philippine Geography? Today I'll try to locate on the map the different Philippine Provinces. Palawan! It's very easy! Bohol? There! Misamis Occidental. I don't really have an idea, but then... Let me guess. That's Zamboanga Sibugay. Is it different to Zamboanga Del Norte? Western Samar? I know this is Samar Island. Northern... Eastern... West... Here, here. Trick question! There's no Western Samar province! Then, what is this? Samar, as in province of Samar. So! You only got... 12 out of 20 provinces correct. I tried. Okay, closing spill in 5,4,3,2.... Well, it seems like I need to study more about my Philippine geography. But, anyway don't forget to click subscribe for more cool videos. This is Karter Kalma! Miss U! And... Cut! Good job! Okay! We have to edit this quickly. Best effort! Anything you can finish before 5pm. Okay? Yes, boss. Bye! Let's go? What is it? (Scream!) Get that away from me! Get that away from me! Get that away from me! I'm allergic to Sunflowers. - Get that away from me! - But, why were you smelling a Sunflower a while ago? It's fake! Boss Conrad bought it in Divisoria. How did you know? You sent the picture to me. Get that away from me! I didn't send anything. - There is! - Nothing! -Fine! I'll just throw it! - Just throw it! Is it gone? Did I send it? I think my phone is really broken. What's the problem? It's very slow! I tried to open the gallery, but it took 30 minutes to open it. I think the memory is already full. No, it's not. I think... Hey! Simon! Hey, my favorite customer! Are you finally gonna buy a phone from my store? No, I already have a phone. But, can you check my phone? Come on! You promised me you're going to buy a phone in my store. Wait, I'll just go to the restroom. Well... I bought that from the street vendor for only 1,500 pesos. Because the cellphones you sell are expensive. Damn, you bought a cellphone from a thief? Anyways, what's the problem? That cellphone's so slow. Try opening the gallery. Let's do a factory reset. Maybe it has a virus. Really? If a cellphone's acting up, it already has a virus? Well, that's the way it is. So, I will reset it, okay? Wait, wait! What will happen to my files there? The contact numbers are in your sim, right? What about my pictures and videos? You back it up, before I do a reset. Can you do it? You know, I don't know how to. Fine, I'll download a StoreBox app. So you can upload your files online. Wait, this phone already has a StoreBox, look! You're right. So, does it mean my files have already been backed up? Well, yes, after I do a factory reset... You can download the StoreBox again. Then, log yourself in. But, how can I log-in if I didn't even know it had a StoreBox. Isn't this your username? Karter_Kalma? What? It's so annoying! There's no hand soap in the restroom. How is it? Let's do it next time, Simon. Where are we going to eat? I'm hungry. I just want to go home. I'm not feeling well. You want to poop? How about you Panti Panti? Do you believe in soulmates? What kind of a boss do you have? Just think of it... He let me believe that we have a lot in common. But, the reason is... he got to see what's in my phone. How can I be sure? And, look what happened with the sunflower? Aw... So, you need more proof? Fine! Good morning, world! After I woke up, I just want eat... watermelon seeds! ♪ My humble hut may look tiny, ♪ ♪ but the veggies around, ♪ ♪ they sure are many. ♪ ♪ Yam beans and eggplants, ♪ ♪ wing’d beans and peanuts, ♪ ♪ string, hyacinth and lima beans. ♪ Hey So red! Are you attending a Christmas Party? -You're wearing green? -Yes! Since this morning. ♪ My humble hut may look tiny, ♪ ♪ but the veggies around, ♪ Whenever I hear that song, it reminds me of my terror professor during highschool days. I really hate that song! I went to a store before I came here... I bought this for you. No, it's fine. It gives me a toothache whenever I eat that. You can have it. Aren't you craving for this? Why would I crave for that if it gives me a toothache whenever I eat it. What is the problem? Why do you look uncomfortable? Is it all fail? What is? I'll just go to the rest room. Now what!? You know the color of my bra? -Trisha! -You're stalking all my pictures and videos on your Storebox! Are you enjoying stalking my life? That's why you looked for me... Because of this phone! This is yours, right? You can have it back. Just pay me 1,500 because I didn't steal it! -Trisha, calm down. - How can I calm down! You're playing me! Soulmates! Soulmates! In reality, you're just a stalker! Do you know what you are? You're a cheater! You're a cheat! On your way! On my heart! Trisha! What!? Just think of it this way! If it wasn't because of StoreBox, we wouldn't have met each other. Why didn't you disconnect it when we met? Here. So we're equal. You can check all my files. You can also check my laptop. I'll give you my password and email. Do you think it will change anything? Trisha! Don't follow me! I will call the police! Don't forget to click the subscribe button for more cool videos. This is Karter Kalma. Miss U! Bro, you look dead! Is there a problem? Is it because of your video with "Leave me away alone" girl? What video? You're just a stalker! Do you know what you are? You're a cheater! You're a cheat! On your way! On my heart! You and "away alone" girl... Are dating? Yes! So?! Trisha is a good person. Is it because of a video where you don't know what really happened? You guys shouldn't judge her as a person. Come on, guys! Give her a break! This is what I'm going to say to you? She does not deserve... the way you guys treat her! She doesn't deserve all your bullshit! Because you only show her anything but hate. Now, what I will only show her is love. Because I love her! Guys! We're still rolling! You know what? This could pass as one special episode. Actually! It will go viral! What now? Is it okay to be uploaded, Karter? It's okay! Okay! We'll be the one to edit this video. And, you? Do what you gonna do, okay? Sorry. So sorry! Trisha! Where is Trisha? She already resigned earlier this morning. She was crying while on the phone. Did you do something to her? Boy. While you're talking to us, why not go to her place? Trisha! Trisha! Who's that? Do you know Trisha? Yes, I am his landlord. She already left. Where will she go? I don't know. She took her security deposit. Trisha? Sorry. Need help? I can't find any clue from all of these pictures. How can I find her? Bro. I think you need to stop here. I don't want to stop. Chill! I didn't mean that you have to stop looking for her. What I mean is... What are you doing? Stop! Kate, what are you... Kate, what are you doing? Kate, stop it! Kate, stop! Kate! Kate! Stop it! Hey! Stop it! Stop it! There's no clue here to find that girl! Guisado, palabok, luglog, canton, malabon, bihon… Our password here is God is watching us no space I rarely left my house. I'll just pretend you went abroad and then I suddenly missed you. -I can just look at your picture. -They're laughing at me. Fine, I'm scared. Super scared. The counselor in Paete removed my scholarship. The counselor in Paete... Paete!? She's from Paete. She went home to Paete. What if she's not there? I'm willing to take the risk. Clean the mess first before you travel. Thank you. Is someone home? Someone home? Who's there? Good afternoon! Does Trisha live here? Trisha? Yes. But... Who are you? I'm Karter. Her friend. You're her classmate in highschool, right? No. I met her in Angeles, Pampanga. Are you her mother? I'm her aunt. She's an orphan. You didn't know that? She mentioned... that she missed her mother and father. They're already dead long ago. How is Trisha? Can I talk to her? She passed by here a while ago. But, she just took her things and left. Did she go back to Angeles? I don't know. But, before she left... She asked for all the addresses of our relatives here in the Philippines. Even her uncle who is a police man who's in Zamboanga, Sibugay. She asked for his number. Is she going there? I really don't know. My niece, Trisha, doesn't tell people about her plans in life. I lost her Panti Panti. I lost her. Soulmates!? Do you believe in soulmates? Can I just throw you in Laguna De Bay!? Just like what Rose did to her necklace in Titanic? Let's go! Hello, Auntie! -Hello, Auntie! I'm sorry. I just went out to buy load. -Where are you? -I might be there in Cabanatuan by tomorrow. - Okay, Take care! I'll just call you when I'm almost there. -You can call me. - Yes, Auntie. Okay. Bye, Auntie. Don't forget to click the subscribe button for more cool videos. This is Karter Kalma and happy 3 million subscribers to us! Miss U! Cut! Thank you! Karter, the client is asking if... If you can endorse their product on social media. In exchange for a gift certificate. I don't have a social media. That's what I told them. Why don't you open a new one? You have a lot of fans. You can earn from it. Let's eat first. Pancit! -It's mine! - Share it to others! Where's the vinegar? It's mine! -It's mine! -What's that? Pancit Guisado! You want? No, thanks. Go ahead. Why not? I'm on a diet. Okay. -It's smell so good. - Who needs a spoon? Good afternoon! Welcome to Otsokokini Cafe! -Pancit luglog? - We don't have pancit luglog here, sir. What? I used to order that. Since when, Sir? 2 years ago. We already changed our management since last year. How about spaghetti, sir? Okay. They don't serve pancit luglog here anymore. Do you think... I'd still see her? Maybe? Maybe... We're not really soulmates. Damn. I actually don't believe in soulmates. We meet people by chance. But, staying in each other's lives? It's not a chance. It's a decision. Is it okay Panti Panti if... I let you go? Yes! I'll just leave you here in Angeles. We don't know. There could be someone who'll take you. Who will love you better... More than I did. Thank you for your understanding. Trisha? Karter? What are you doing here? I just passed by. How about you? I just passed by also. Actually... Fine, I didn't just passed by. I really wanted to come here. Because I saw your picture with Panti Panti in boss Lea's Restaurant. You're the admin of that page, right? Yes. At first... I doubted if it's really there. Because boss Lea's place changed a lot . But, then I saw your caption. Pancit luglog. That's why I immediately went there. From Tarlac... to Angeles after work. However... you were not there. Then, I checked Panti Panti's page again. I saw his picture at the ginilo store. However... you were also not there. I posted Panti Panti's picture here in the plaza just a while ago. You came really quick! What? You have new pictures of Panti Panti here? I didn't see it yet. What? How did you get here? I just tried my luck. Looks like you went to all the places that we've been before. Actually... I didn't just pass by here... I went here to leave Panti Panti. How dare you. Are you leaving Panti Panti here? I will try to move on from you. Where is he? Here! You're so dramatic! You can just give it to the children! Wow! Now, I'm dramatic? You're the one who came for me here in Angeles. You should've just commented on Panti Panti's page. I was supposed to send you a message. If I didn't find you. But I found you! You missed me. Whatever. Wait... If you're following Panti Panti's page, it means you have your Facebook back? I created a new account just last year. You're not scared anymore? Not anymore. And... I also saw your video. What video? Wait. -Trisha, is a good person. -Okay, okay. -Don't play it! -Are you shy? Let's volume up! What? What did you say!? What did you say!? What did you say, Karter!? Karter! Here, what you said is... Give it to me! Give it to me! Because I love her! (Only One song...) Let's eat? Where? Do you like persian food? No. -Korean? -Spicy. Japanese? You know what? Anywhere, when I'm with you. Joke. Fine. I'll decide. Persian food -I don't like Persian food that much. -You're call. Let's go to...
