[tense music] I killed my grandmother. I took her to a cemetery. I took her to the cemetery where I wanted to lay her to rest, but before I buried her six feet under, I cut her into pieces. Some of the organs I brought to the session this evening, this was a brain. Oh, gross. It's disgusting. No, thank you. I'm kosher. Hey, Kristine, why don't you take this and replace it for the one in your head. [music continues] You know, oh, obviously I can, uh, tell by the size of the, the right lobe that your grandmother was a very educated person. Silence. Next comes my granny's hand. Jason, is this the same hand that your grandmother used to pleasure herself? That's really sick, Pete. Shhhhh. No, I'm going to pass around the bowels. This is pretty heavy guys. I think it's full of shit. Hmm. Take. No, I'm gonna vomit. Mom. I had an accident. Now comes the moment. You will never forget. I had some problems extracting this one, but. What? Here it is. Mm. The heart. Oh god. Ugh. I can't take this anymore. All right. All right, let's cut this out. How about we do something fun instead of this ghoulish mess? Hey Jason, where'd you really get this shit? They're pig guts. I totally had you guys going. Well, you really thought they were my grandma's organs. Oh, right, Jason, right. - Pig. You have nothing better to do with your time than buy pig guts thanks Jason. Like you almost kill your grandmother. You were looking kind of logginly at those organs. Stop. You save some towels. No, no, we don't do this every weekend. Who want’s some beer? No, how about some coke. Lay off the drugs, man. Oh, look at that. Those are so cool. I know. Where'd you get them? I got 'em at that new place called, is that shoes. I’m gonna tell you something. It's important. Oh yeah. - Yeah. Oh my god. Oh, this guy at the company workout. He is so hot. He would believe the body on this guy. I talked to him. He's so sweet. I swear it's different than all the other players I've dated, I swear to you. And, uh, I gave him my number. Okay. And we're probably gonna go out soon. Good. I hope it works out. I will ready do. I'm so sick of the play. It's over. - Okay. It's over with that I swear. Did you dye your hair? You did? Tell me. I was waiting for you to tell me. Yeah. I got bored at the same old thing every single day. Oh, it's cute. Yeah, but listen about this guy. Mm-hmm. Be careful. You know how men are. Please. They don't have it. They want it. And when they have it, they throw it away. I know. Yep. Guess what? I talked to my boss and it looks like I'm gonna start working at the salon again. That's cool. Mm-hmm. So, how's Tomi? Oh. Tom. I got in a fight with my dad the other day, and he's so mad at me. I slept over at Tom's house for two nights. Two nights? What'd you do over there for two nights? Oh, you know, a little bit of romance and a little bit of sex. That's what I thought. I'm so in love with him. I just have to lose some weight. 10 pounds and I will be so happy. I've been killed for that ass. I'd killed for those boobs. Well, god bless me. Ah, Christine Tomaso from Gurnee, Illinois lost 10 pounds. Come on now. Get down the pounds. You guys are idiots. No, [ominous music] Here's a toast to our ambitious future that finally we all finish college and hopefully we're gonna have a sexual partner, right? I have one right here. Merry Christmas. And finally, my mom. Stop stalking me. Thank you very much. Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. Hey Michelle. Drink up, man. We're all praying to the porcelain. God, by the time the night's over, leave her alone Pete. If she doesn't wanna drink, she doesn't wanna drink. Big deal. See, women are aware of when they should drink or not, and you boys obviously don't understand that. Natalie, I know you're a serious feminist, but leave men alone. A man discovered America. Caesar was a man. The pope is a man. Jesus Christ was a man. The president of the United States is not a woman either, and, and do you know who discovered the light bulb? A man men are the leading forces of life, family, and uh, golf. Yeah. Wilson. Woo. - Alright. Yeah. Vic. Yeah, baby. Yeah. You know Vic, you're a really nice boy, but if there weren't women, then you wouldn't exist and you wouldn't be able to bless us with your ever so stimulating comments. Stop arguing. We're wasting time. If I wanted to argue, I would've stayed at home with my younger brother. Oh, we're not arguing an argument would consist of two intelligent people. Yeah, let's talk about something intelligent and a little provocative. Okay. Uh, you mean, uh, sex? Oh, that sounds great. When was the last time you guys had a really good sexual experience? I mean, sweating and going nuts? Uh, I think it was five minutes ago. Shut up. I want the truth from all of you. Okay. - Okay. We'll start with you. No, I don't feel like sharing my personal life with anyone. Not much to share. Shut up. Why don't you try and be a gentleman for once? All right. What? Cut the shit, guys. Yeah. Let's talk. Ladies and gentlemen, let's not forget why we are here tonight. We are here to induct Michelle into our group, our special group of unique and ingenious clowns. Who come together and think of new ways not to be a bunch of losers in life. Right? Michelle? I hope you like it here in Chicago. We guarantee fun, fellowship, excitement, happiness, basically everything. And little bit of suspense. Thank you. Um, I just wanted to tell you guys. After I got here from Seattle, I had a really hard time, uh, missing my old friends and all, but, uh, I'm really happy that I met you guys. Um, you're all a little off, but a lot of fun. Um, spent the last 20 years there and hope to spend the next 20 here. So don't make me cry my eyes out. You're gonna love it in Chicago. You will, you know, Michelle, can I call you Michelle? Life is like a rich meringue and, and I'm diabetic, so I can't enjoy it, but, that said, pipe down. Um, you know, a lot of people come in and out of your life as you get older, but it's the ones that stick around who really matter. So, you know, that's what we found here today and we're just glad that you could join us. But that said, never trust anyone. Careful. Wine enhances your sexual desires, you. Someone's getting a little too excited, I swear. Natalie, I think you're the horniest girl. I know. All you do is talk about sex. So who doesn't like sex? It's the most amazing feeling in the world, right? Do you know what it's like to make love to a man? You're in love with. See, I don't really wanna know that because personally I love women. Shut up. Women. Uh, no. No women. I like you baby. Hmm. Well, if you wanna know my opinion, guys are the ones who harass women. Women don't want sex, they won't romance. Yeah. Right. What about that time when you went shut up. I can’t stand you. I wonder why women confuse the emotions of men by acting as if they don't want it. But in reality, they want it just as bad as men. In fact, I think they enjoy playing mind games. That's bullshit. A woman has to do that to push the guy into a better performance. I just want men and women to get along. That's it. You know? Keep trying, I think, and you gotta be aware of what I think. I think it's really difficult these days to please a woman. You know, it's, you have to be a professional so it works out perfectly and you gotta know what you're doing with your banana sometimes. Banana. - Yeah. I think, and I think that you've been drinking a little too much. No, no, no, no. I just, I didn't drink anything. I just had a glass of milk and that's it. Michelle, what do you think of all this? Do you like it? Well, I've always wanted a serious relationship, but I'm a little afraid of sex. Afraid? Of sex? What are you paranoid? What do you mean? I don't know. I'm just afraid of it. If you're not experienced and you're scared, don't worry about it. It'll all come together for you. I used to be scared. Hey, let's talk about our paranoias. Ooh, I dig this topic. Hey, what scares you, Jason? Me? I'm scared when I kill a spider, I'm afraid that thousands of his spider friends will revenge their fellow spider's death by devouring me. I have a sick paranoia. I am terrified that deep in my subconscious. I have the urges of a mass murderer. Sometimes my mind thinks these strange thoughts. I just hope I never act them out. Somebody call 911. Anyway, listen, my paranoia’s that I'm home alone and there's someone in the house with me who's after me and all the noises and creaks that get my mind racing, but then I realize it's only me. Yeah, Monica, I get freaked out when I'm in a house all alone. I've got this weird paranoia. It's, it's really more of a fear about my sex life. Like whenever a girl's giving me head, I'm always scared. She's gonna like bite my tool off and throw it in the backyard or something. That's disgusting. I've got this weird paranoia. It's, it's actually more of like a reoccurring dream, right? Well, it's no secret that Monica wants me, right. So We're all hanging out like this and it gets late and uh, we all kind of fall asleep. But Monica can't contain her passion for me, so the heat of her loins actually ignites a fire and burns the house down, kills us all. What about you, Kristine? What's your fear? I don't have one. Come on, Chris. Last time you sat you had a paranoia about my brother. You said he freaked you out, right? Come on, Kris, tell us what's going on here. I don't think my story will fit this discussion. Kristine, I wanna know, tell us, I have this paranoia because Tom's brother cheated on his wife, which ended their relationship. I'm just afraid that he might do the same thing to me. Ooh, that's a tough one. I'd never cheat on your baby. Never. Unless you wanted to join us with Natalie sometimes for, oh. Hey! The only dude who never confessed his paranoia was Tom. Okay, well, I used to be extremely paranoid person, [ominous music] but I'm not like that anymore. I can control it. In fact, I can show you my paranoia right here in this house. What are you talking about? You are a paranoia freak. How are you gonna show us your paranoia? Just wait a second. Let me explain everything. My inspiration came from Jason's grandmother game. I have prepared for you something even more shocking, spectacular. I will create a paranoia for everyone. A horror skit, really short skit. I need you all to leave the house for an hour so I can set everything up. Once you come back, I will show you my paranoia right here. Cool. That sounds like a good idea. I like fear. Let's not go anywhere. Let's just stay here. Just tell us what it is. Don't worry. This is harmless. I've thought everything through. It's gonna be a really short skit. Let's have some fun. Yeah, but where are we gonna go? Everyone's been drinking. Everyone's been drinking. You're the one who's been drinking. What's at your fourth now? Come on, let's just stay here and talk. Shut up. Did your mom pick this outfit up for you? I think it's an awesome idea. Okay, let's go then. Hey, this sounds good, Tom. I'll stick around and help you out. It should be fun. No, I got this one. Pete, I'm gonna give you the keys to the house. After an hour, I want you all to come back to the house as we never talked about the skit tonight. - Okay? Just come into the house, sit right here and wait for me. Okay? - Alright. Alright. Let's go. Sorry, I had to leave urgently. Explain later, Tom. Yeah, right. What's a sickie trying to pull? It's part of the skit. He's trying to mess with our heads. I kind of like the way it's starting out. It's not the start. It's bullshit. Just how I assumed Tom's just fucking around with us. Maybe you really had to leave for some reason. I don't see his car anywhere. Right you guys, this car isn't, bro. I, you probably parked it around the corner. Well, let's stand here in the freezing cold all night. Let's just go in. Who’s got the freaking keys, Pete. Hurry up. Geez. Come on. Oh geez. All right, let the games begin. It's time to have some fun. I wonder what he is up to? Where is he? God, it’s cold. I give him like 10 minutes and then I’ll leave it. Pleasant surprise. Yeah, it's a little different. I'm so excited. Hey, hey, let's, let's turn off the lights. Nothing's going to happen. Be patient, Vic. Hey, who wants a beer? Hey, score me one. Get me one too. Hey, get yourself one sweet cakes. Oh, thank you so much. You're so sweet, bastard. Don't worry, I got you covered. - No, no. Hey guys, let's just stay put and wait for tom’s skit. What are you, Tom's assistant? [Scary sound] What was that? It's a raccoon. [suspenseful music] Shhh, guys. I bet you Tom started his skit. Are you guys nuts? I don't hear anything. Yeah, it sounds like somebody's crying. Oh my god. Somebody's crying in the basement. It's not coming from the basement. It has to be from somewhere else. But where? Don’t worry, we'll figure it out. It's in the backyard. No, I'm positive it's in the basement. No way, dudes. It's totally coming from outside. Basement. It's gotta be the basement. - Oh, okay. You guys are telling me that there's someone in the basement crying, who needs help. I'm gonna check it out. Anyone else coming? What are you chicken? Just go by yourself. Maybe somebody should go with him. Hey, here, Jason. Here's what you go down to the basement. Locate this, uh, psycho who's crying. All right? Sort everything out. If you need help, just give us a signal. We'll come down and help you. Thanks a lot bud. Go already, go right. Fine. Bye-bye so long my friends, I'm going to unite with my grandmother Tom, you down here? Tom. You down here? Tom. Tom, come on. You're scaring me. Hey, we're all upstairs waiting for you. What's going on? Are you setting up your skit? Still, Tom, c’mon Tom, you're scaring me. Tom, you hanging out in the basement again by yourself trying to trick us. [crying sound] Granny? What are you doing here? [dramatic music] What is that psycho doing down there? What about the guys? They're a lot different here than Seattle? Uh, no, the guys are pretty much the same it seems, you know, I mean, like this one, it's the people are generally a little different, but you know, I, most people I've met are pretty nice. Wait, but um, listen, the crying stopped. Let's go. No, no, no, no, no. We have to wait for Jason's signal. This is bullshit. I'm getting bored. Let's either fucking do something or go home. You know what? I gotta go. Where are you going? You're leaving. - No. So where do you have to go? Nature calls. Don't take too long. You might miss something. [tense music] I guess when I drove over the curb, I like broke the axle or something, so I'm completely screwed this summer. I don't even know how I'm gonna get to work. Yeah. So my sister's taken off moving to Cincinnati. Turns out I get her new car. Which you know, powder blue's gonna have to go, but I figure it's got potential, you know, repaint it, put some rims on it think could be cool, you know? Seriously. Is Monica all right? She's fine. Whatever. [Window slamming sound] Yeah, there it is. That's the signal. Let's go. Finally. So excited. Monica I’ll be right out. Just a second. [tense music continues] Shut up. Jason. Kill, kill, kill. We're coming. Are you ready for us, kill, kill, kill Jason? Oh god, no. Shut up. - Sorry. I'm just kidding. I wonder what's going on. [dramatic music] Jason. Where the fuck are you? Jason, come on. This isn't funny. Whoaaah. [dramatic music] Jesus. God. Alright, Tom, you almost had a fooled. Nice. Almost. Come on Jason, get up. Knock it off. Come on, it's over. Come on. Wake up. Jason. Jason, Jason. Hey guys, this is, this is blood. This is blood. Oh my god. He's dead. [Screaming] Oh my god. Yo, are you all right? No, he’s really dead look, he’s not moving. Hey, Jason c’mon. You're scaring the girls. Gosh, he is dead. [ominous music] She's right. He’s gone what are we gonna do? Who would do this? Where is Tom? That psycho boyfriend of yours went too far. This was not supposed to happen this way. He wouldn't do this. There's someone else in his house. Have someone else's Tom man. Where is that motherfucker? This is just like him. He's always the one to take things too far. No, Tom would not he do this. He is not a murderer. Get help now. Hold on. Just get yourself together. We have to call the police. Let's just get out of here. Hey guys. Where's Monica? Oh my god. Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica. [Screams] Oh my god. Oh my god. [Girls screaming] Is she alive? She’s dead. Oh my god, poor Monica, who did this to you? This is his skit? This was never supposed to happen. Tom, Tom did not do this, he- He couldn't have. Monica come on. Stay with us. Don't die on us. She's dead. Who sick game is this? We're all gonna die. What kind of games do you guys play? Everybody? Just shut up. Let's call 911. No, let's just get the hell outta here. Listen, do you hear the music playing? There's music. You want a sick skit? Ahhh. You twisted fuck, motherfucker! What a fuck? Stop, no! What’s wrong with you, what the fuck? You fucking killed them. They're fucking dead. What are you talking about? I went to get some chips and beer. How do we know that you went to the store? Will someone please tell me, what the fuck's wrong with you guys? You think you're so smart to mess with us. You always wanted the best skit. Now you've got it. Fuck. Leave him alone. He didn't do it. Why should we trust him? It was his fucking skit. Didn't you fucking hear me? I went to the store, came back here. What's wrong with you? Okay, Kristine, please dude, let me say something. Okay? Say something. I do, I'm just, I'm just scared. Okay? Look! There she is. [Breathing heavy] Oh god. Sorry. Let's get this psycho. We have to call the police. Stay with the girls. That one. Okay, here we go. I think, it’s the right door. You think? Tom! Pete! Open the door, Pete! [Granny screams] Tom! [Bat hitting scream] I'm gonna go see what's going on. No Vick! Stay. I don't wanna to die tonight. Tom. Tom. [dramatic music] Pete? Pete? Hey, stop. Okay. I understand. No, I, yeah, I understand. If you could, okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. The police are on the way. And we are not to leave the house. And where's Kristine? She took Pete down. I couldn't help him. Are you guys all right? Where's Kristine? She told me she was gonna run to the gas station to get some help. Help? I told you to watch out for them! Why did you let her leave the house? You idiot! I was on the phone with the police! She said she would go get help while you guys were out there. Why didn't you stop her? She's gonna get killed. I tried. I couldn't stop her. She was sure she could sneak away to get some help. We have to find Kristine, let's go. You come with me, Natalie. Vic, you stay here with Michelle. Okay. [suspenseful music] [music continues] The killer has Kristine. She's dead. Oh my god. Vic. Vic. [Michelle screaming] Vic. There you are. Kristine is dead. What are we gonna do? Vic. [dramatic music] Michelle, why did you leave me? It's granny. She's here. I saw her. - Shhh. She was knitting. Relax. She's here. She's okay. I just went to get the gun. I remembered that Tom's dad had one in the closet. Will be okay. I've got the gun now. Now there's only one bullet, so we have to make sure that it hits. Why is this happening? All our friends, there was nothing we could do. I just saw Kristine get strangled like an animal. I'll get you out of here. We just have to be careful and you have to do exactly what I say. [eerie music] Vic. [suspenseful music] Michelle, it's me. It's me, wait! Kristine is dead. Let's get out of here I can’t take this. No, I'm not leaving. I'm gonna get the motherfucker, go. Get help. Go, take the car. Don’t stay. Just go. Don’t stay. Can't do this on his own, she's gonna kill him. We have to go back. We can't stay. If we do, we're good as dead. We can’t leave him. Get into the car Michelle, let’s go. [heavy breathing] [girls screaming] [honk] [suspenseful music] Tom. Tom. Tom. I can't get open. Tom. Oh, I can't get it open. Tom. Oh god. Oh my god. It’s okay. Tom. Oh god. Okay. Oh god. Oh god. God. Oh god. Tom. Tom. Tom. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Go to hell, you son of the bitch! [Gunshot] [music intensifies] A specialist sorrow accompanies the passing of someone so young. All that has been lost. And all that would have been linger us in our hearts and minds. Michelle, gentle of heart, compassionate and proud, touched each and every one of us in special ways, a tragedy for her friends and family. Indeed. Yet let us not solely mourn, but celebrate for her spirit lives on, we are each of us. Return for heaven allowed Michelle to be a part of our lives. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. May god have mercy on her soul. In nomine patris et spiritus sancti. Amen. We shouldn't have let this happen. We couldn't have known, I mean, who would've thought. So we went too far. Nobody thought this could happen and it did. It's not our fault. Do you think the cops will buy our story? She's dead. They're not gonna just let this go. Hey, we were just trying to have a little fun. That makes it okay? Michelle. I, I just can't believe it. What if they really look into what happened? What are they gonna find out? All there's to know that my brother just dressed up as a granny. And scared her a little bit. That was more than a little bit Tom. We let this girl think that a psycho offed her friends, she had a heart condition. You know. Jesus Christ. It's a lot tamer than the skit you pulled on me. That was a good one though, right? She was just too innocent. We should have thought what? That she wouldn't care that we were getting murdered in front of her face. All right, so we weren't thinking. Weren't thinking. Is that the best that you could think of? I don't know. All I'm saying is that we've all been in that situation in one way or another before and we're still here. - Yeah, there's a point. We've all been through this. - Yeah. Yeah, well she didn’t stick around for the punch line. This is pathetic. You and your goddamn brother, just take it easy, okay? Don't pretend you had nothing to do with this. Don't do that! You're the one who started the stupid game. You can't blame it all on me. She trusted us and we took advantage of it. Next time, we'll just have to do. Next time? Are you fucking serious? This was a person. Her family is destroyed because of us. Because of our stupid game. She was a living, breathing soul. And we, we ended that. We took on, we took on a power that wasn't hours to take. And that just isn’t right. [tense music]
