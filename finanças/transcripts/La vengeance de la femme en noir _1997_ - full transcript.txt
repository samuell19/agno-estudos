HD Presentation The digitization and restoration of this film remain faithful to the body and spirit of the original work. They have been made possible by funding from MYSTERIOUS KIDNAPPING A businessman disappears under the nose of the police AUGUSTIN MARLEAU questioned by the police Hey! Wait! Hey! Wait! Don't run away! Wait! I... I...I didn't mean to scare you. I'm not... It's just that... I've a question to ask you. Just one. That's it, Marleau. Don't be scared. The weight of your suspicions is... Cut! Damn it! Cut! Cut! Cut! That's not Styrofoam. It doesn't make sense! Flop. A complete flop. Come and help me. No, no, no, no, no. No. It doesn't work. It's not that. At all. We don't feel you. Where are your guts, Marleau? What are you waiting for to put your heart into it? Yes, but there, I almost lost it out for good. Look. It's cast iron. It's not Styrofoam. I almost got killed. Listen to me. You're an actor, aren't you? Yes, yes. Well then, leave the hardware to the technicians. It's their business. Concentrate on your character. OK? Marleau! - I want to. Ah, Marleau, Marleau, your look is empty. There are no sparks. I want that look. I want it. Understand? - I'll give it to you. Promised. Watch it! Watch it. Don't tear it. I don't have a copy of that! Do you have copies of my dad? If he'd been crushed, would you have patched him up? How dumb do you have to be to make movies? I hate Marleau. Ã‰douard, forget Marleau. He's not important. He's not worth it. That's it, that's it, defend him! Do you know what he made me lose? - If you persist, we'll lose our partners' trust. It's not yet time. You still love him, right? Not since I've met you. There's nothing to do. What can I tell you? We're screwed. It's true, it's not great, your look, Marleau. It should be... ice cold. If my eyes met yours, I should melt. Augustin Marleau, you're under arrest. - But... Whether you say anything or not, be sure it'll be held against you. Hey, bozo, out. You've no right to interrupt my shooting. I'll complain. To whom? The police? What are you doing? - Sorry. Where are you taking him? Let go. Hey! Leave my dad alone, he hasn't done anything. I bet you don't even have a warrant. You cast that actor? No way, your office insisted on having him. We didn't, anyway. You saw his face? He ruins the whole concept. Arson is... What do you want me to tell you? I wasn't there. Hey, hey, hey, don't put us on. Well, nobody saw me. So, I guess I wasn't there. We wrote a nice statement for you, sign it. Is that clear? - Damn! How can one be so stubborn? You discourage me! Will you leave me in peace? I don't even know what you're talking about. I had nothing to do with it. You have to believe me. Hey, fix me this with... a wireless mike, OK? Marleau, Marleau, Marleau. Do you really think I'll swallow your lies? I wasn't born yesterday. You're in it up to your neck, Marleau. I know it, I smell it. It stinks like an old cheese. That doesn't lie. How many times do I have to tell you? I'm an actor trying to earn a living! And my $3,000 contract has just disappeared thanks to you. Disappeared? Contract? Strange. - Why, strange? Yes, yes, strange. Why strange? I have to sign a contract, I'm a member. - Yes, let's talk about your contracts! Thursday, July 23, you're shooting a commercial for Continental Trust, no? Yes. - Owner: Henri de Bailliencourt, former finance minister of Burkina-peso? The same night, the former minister now a millionaire disappears during a show at the Caf'Conc' Cabaret. He's sitting smack in the middle of the hall. Suddenly! He vanishes. Like a magic trick. Does it ring a bell, Marleau? - I don't read the papers. No? - I find them too depressing. Yes? Yes. It's true that... Thursday, August 20, you shoot another commercial for Chiche-MobilitÃ©. The same night, Chiche-MobilitÃ©'s CEO disappears during a show at the Caf'Conc' Cabaret. Two commercials, two abductions. How do you explain that, Marleau? Well, I... I never go out on Thursdays. It wasn't me. It was you, you hear? You'll see that next to me, a Pitbull is as sweet as a Poodle. It'll hurt, Marleau. Blood will flow, but you'll spit it out, I swear. Lay off me! I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything! Let go of me! - Inspector! Inspector Grasselli. May I see you a moment? Listen, we're tired. Cooperate. Just a little signature. Come on. Are you sick? Don't tell me you arrested that guy again? It's not serious! What are you thinking, Grasselli? The other times, I covered you, but this time, Grasselli, I wash my hands of it. Grasselli! Not inspector anymore? We're friendly now that you had a promotion? And you, it's jealousy that drives you crazy? Yes! I'm sick with jealousy, Paul. Sick with jealousy! I'm the one who should have been appointed captain. Me! You can't imagine how jealous I am of you, Paul. If you only knew how little you're losing. I spend all my time shut in an office. It's not very exciting. Every day, I regret the time we were a team, Inspector. Paul, trust me. Give me a chance. Marleau's the culprit. I know, I'm sure of it. I've let him stew long enough, he's ready to be picked now. You've nothing against him. You just don't like the look of him. Yes, for sure. He's two-faced. Don't let me down, Paul. Not after what we lived together. - I can't do anything. Think of all the years we spent together. That's a lot of investigations. We were great detectives. You remember the exhilaration of shadowing? The excitement of raids? The ecstasy of questioning? You enjoyed questioning, didn't you, Paul? Do you remember the math test? Yes! - We were sly, weren't we? Listen, smart-ass, we'd like to ask you a question. Very easy. Two plus two makes what? Well, it makes... - Wait, careful, don't answer too fast. Think before you speak. You might get it wrong. Four. No, it doesn't make four! What do you mean, not the right answer? Two plus two makes four. Ouch! Ouch! It doesn't make four? Oh, it feels good. OK, this time, answer very carefully. The inspector's giving you another chance. - Only one. Two plus two makes what? - Four. Five? Excellent! You see that you can. We made them understand it was better to answer what we wanted to hear. We are a team? Right? You'll help me nab Marleau? We are a team, Inspector. Something else, Paul. Now that we're a team, I'd like you to call me "sir". It'd please me so much. If you want, sir. Good evening, ladies. Sorry we're late. Say, Ã‰douard, what was the point of this afternoon's murder attempt? How did you dare do that? A murder? How vulgar! It stinks of small-scale improvisation. That's not how we'll make our crimes works of art. You think so? Really? Remember that in Italy, under the Borgias, for 30 years, there was war, terror, murders and assassinations. And that gave Da Vinci, Michelangelo and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, five centuries of peace and democracy. What did it give? The cuckoo clock! The cuckoo clock. Cuckoo! Ã‰douard is a big child. - The cuckoo clock! He promises to be wiser from now on. He won't bother with Marleau anymore. Since the beginning, you persist in involving... this Marleau in our business. Why? What distinguishes him? Ã‰douard, are you hiding anything from us? Why? You want to know why? Really? You're our adviser, Ã‰douard. Show us the art of crime, but don't keep secrets from us, OK? Relax, Ã‰douard. Tell these ladies Marleau is unimportant. Forget him. It was a whim. Very well! I'll tell you everything. Marleau... Marleau? Marleau is... Mar... Marleau naturally has a guilty face. A bandit look. When the police keep an eye on him, we run fewer risks. Tonight then... Tonight, it'll be up... It'll be... It'll be up to you to lure him where he shouldn't be. WRECK STREET They're all little balls, right? Yes. - They look like BB shots. A 12-gauge shotgun cartridge emptied in oil. Darker, but not as hard, I hope. It doesn't smell much either. Where does Florence get that? Not Florence, Denise. Florence and me, it's over. My new mistress is Denise. She's the one who works at Radio-Canada? Yeah. She's class, Denise. A real lady. She has to be. Not just anybody can get into Radio-Canada. Even to do cleaning. She gets that from the office of a big shot. He has a cupboard full, it seems. It's smart. I bought the bottle though. How long had you been shacking up with Florence? Eight years. But I broke it up. It was starting to go to her head. She wanted me to leave my wife. No way. I'm a Catholic. Take a shot. Mmm! That's good! Hey! It's Marleau! Quick, quick! Get the headphones. Give me the headphones! Raise the volume. Volume raised. Come on! Come on. Good. This isn't the time to have no brakes. What's that? It must be the police's doughnuts. What is he saying? Doughnuts... Police... I don't see the relation. Will the day ever end? It's unending! What's that doing there? Come on, it can't be. Come on! I gassed up? I only had a 20. I had a 20 left. Oh no! Where's my head? Do we arrest him... for that? - No, stupid! Not right now. Raise the volume, I can't hear anything. I don't hear well. Volume at maximum. Oh no! I lost my most lucrative commercial on top of that. What a rotten day! Hey, there's nobody. - What? You could have looked where you were going, dickhead! Hey, I'm not a dickhead. Besides, you were driving. So what? Does it stop you from looking? Come on! This car's a goner. We'll find another one. Augustin Marleau. Is that you? Yes. I was waiting for you, Marleau. There! There's someone at the window! No, no, no, it's a decoration. Mister Marleau, help me. My husband's in danger. Stay calm. Where? What? I'll take care of it. I'll dial 9-1-1. I already programmed it. I only have one key to press. It's much faster for emergencies. - Don't joke. It's you I need. Me? To do what? Johnny Pizza Delight, The best pizza in town. 24-hour delivery in 20 minutes. Your order? - I pressed the wrong key. I'm sorry. Yes, I have a light. I want you to follow my husband to protect him. He hides it from me, but I know he's in danger. What can I do? I know nothing about husbands. As soon as I get involved, everything gets muddled up. With my luck, your problems will only get worse. Please, don't pretend to be simple-minded. I inquired about you. I know who you are. And you proved it to me just now by throwing yourself into my arms. I apologize. I'm sorry. It's because... today I worked with an actress who made eyes at me. Well, I think. A really superb woman. When I saw you, I thought, that's it, it's my lucky day. Because you're really very, very beautiful. I'm rather lonely these days... Do you speak like this to all women, Marleau? Well, not to all at the same time, no. How uncouth you are! Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. I'll make you an advance then? Ah, yes. It'll do, I hope. And a ticket for tonight's performance. Hey! Hey, madam! Wait! I'm an actor, not a detective! I don't get your story, madam! Her husband, I don't even know what the guy looks like. Dad worries me. Not only is his life in a shambles, but a sick cop insists on persecuting him. He can't take it anymore. He's on the blink. He'll end up completely nuts. Don't exaggerate. Your dad has a duck's back. Bad luck rains on him, but he never gets wet. I don't know what good I could be. You could boost his morale. It'd do him good to know his ex-wife's still thinking of him. I'm telling you, he's depressed. He's going nuts. He worries me. Well, we decided we shouldn't see each other anymore. He was full of himself. Since he's not in control of his life, he strives to make himself believe he has a word to say. You're going past! - I know. I saw Grasselli. We'll go around, and enter by the back door. It's dad's car burning! Surely, a self-destruction phenomenon. I bet you that, optimist as he is, your dad bought enough insurance to get three limos. Lucky him. That's what you did to get this car? No, there are means that are more sportsmanlike. It's impossible. All I want is that nothing happens to me. Well, no. It's not enough for a brick to fall on my head, the whole building has to tip over. Why does bad luck dog me like a bulimic leech? What can one do against bad luck? What can I do when I'm in up to here? Avoid opening your trap, stupid. Who? Who said that? Who's there? Calm down, Marleau. Calm down. It's only me, your conscience. My what? Your positive conscience. Or, if you prefer, I'm what you could have been. Hey! Be careful, little man, I'm sensitive. You better believe me. I'm what you could have been if you'd decided to feel good about yourself. License in marketing, masters in communication. Vice-President of the hottest advertising agency in town. Intellectual, financially well-off. Yuppie in full rise. No existential problem either. All women are after me. I'm willing to believe you are what I could have been. But you could at least look physically like me. It's enough to be the conscience of a guy like you, if, on top of it, I have to have your face! Did you ever see yourself in a mirror, Marleau? With a face like yours, only in Alcatraz could you ever succeed. But you're out of luck, Alcatraz is closed. - You have the face of someone who would succeed in life? Sure. Above all, I've the right frame of mind. I don't chase bad luck. I'm not always whining. I react. What's a positive conscience? Does that mean I also have a negative conscience? Well, yes. But it's gone to work elsewhere. With you, it had nothing to do. On that, you're right. I'm spineless. I never succeed at anything in life. But is it my fault if everything is against me? Say, you're my positive conscience! Instead of sinking me, aren't you supposed to protect me? Advise me? I don't know. That's the job of a guardian angel. No luck, guardian angels never existed. Okay, I confess, I'm fed up with you. It's simple, you get on my nerves. I tried my best, but nothing works. You're a victim. You act like a victim, think like a victim. Always helpless, hampered by your secret fears, big or small, real or unreal. The rot has already set in, your destiny is mapped out. I've been whispering to you what to do for 39 years. Results: zilch, zero. I've come to tell you not to count on me anymore. OK? I'm resigning. I will no longer get involved. Well, that's it! Get out! Careful! You don't know what you're saying. If you think your life is a mess, wait to see what it'll be like without me. You have no idea how many times I intervened to help you. Your life without me won't be an easy matter. You'll see. Well, I warned you. I can leave with a clear conscience. Hey, not so fast. Perhaps we can talk about it. Dialogue can fix many things. Oh, then. Good riddance! Without you, my life can't be any worse. It's impossible. Dad, wake up. - A trombone! Are you okay? - What are you doing here? I came to see if everything was all right. Are you okay? You're sure? Yes, yes, I'm okay. I just had a nightmare. Hi. I know, we weren't supposed to see each other anymore. JosÃ©e insisted. Don't worry, I'm not here to baby you. Just to help you as a friend, if you need. We went to bail you out at the police station, but they'd already released you. You're sure you're okay now? Are you okay? - Yes, I'm managing. The inspector has nothing against me. I even think the captain gave him a real telling-off. What's all that money? You robbed a convenience store? No. No, it's not real. No, it's... It's fake. It's nothing. Actually, I have... I have a show to... A ticket to a show. It's very important. It's like an audition. I have to meet someone very important. I just have time to jump into my car. Dad, there's a problem with your car. What? It's burning at the end of the street. Well, I'll take a cab. We can drive you. - No, no, no, I'll take a cab. Don't forget to close up. You see? That's it. His neurons are disconnected. He's suddenly aggressive and the next minute, nothing bothers him. That man's all mine. Eight years of my life, and he ditches me. We don't live like others. - Why does he do that to me? Sometimes, we need small compensation. Twenty years of marriage, the stress of our work, you understand. In such conditions, a man needs to put a little garlic butter on his bread. You know what I mean? With Florence... I'll put garlic butter on your bread, bastard! I'm telling you that with her, there was swell in the waterbed! The problem with women is that things don't look good for very long. With Denise, my new girlfriend, no more clouds on the horizon. Bastard! Your wife doesn't suspect anything? God, no. Are you crazy? She can't. She's Catholic too. There would be a cyclone. There would be a hurricane. There he is. Go slow, slow, slow. I don't want him to spot us. Disgusting! They're all the same! I need a change of air! And the air is you! Air? Air! Do I look like air? Here, take that! That's it, go away! Good air, bastard! Don't bother coming back! - You bet I won't! I'm not saying goodbye, silly bitch! I'd rather work than see your face! 100 IMPORTANT QUOTATIONS BY THE WORLD'S TOP PHILOSOPHERS "Man is superior to the Universe. Even if the Universe were in league to destroy Man, Man would survive because he would know the Universe is in league against him, while the Universe would not know that Man knows." Hey, egghead, did you get that? - Yeah. I'm not asking you if you heard, I'm asking you if you understood. I understood. It means that the guy who doesn't know I'll hit him will get a real thrashing. The Universe, dummy, the Universe, not Joe Blow. Joe Blow, the Universe, it's the same. Bring 'em on. You're so dumb. Hey, I'll whup you. - You're just frustrated. What do you mean? - The tragedy with you is that you're tall, strong, slow and dumb. What? - Careful, careful. Goddamn scumbag, I'll burst his bubble. He'll pay for it. I'll finish him. I'll burst his bubble. Come on! He plays in two commercials for two big companies. By a curious coincidence, the owners of those businesses are kidnapped on the day of the shooting. I cross-checked, you understand. This morning, I questioned Marleau's agent on the q.t. He told me he had two more to do, today and tomorrow. So? It's not a reason to act without thinking. I admit, I admit. I got carried away. I shouldn't have arrested him so fast. It's better to do... - Shit. ...what we're doing now: tail him. What did I tell you? - You said it. It'll be the good one. Maybe... - I made a mistake... Innocent! I'll make him pay, the dirty rat. I'll butter your garlic bread with slugs. Come on! Shit! Hey, listen to this one: "We call good what is likely to bring us pleasure and we call evil what is likely to bring us pain." Did you understand that? - No. Ouch! Hey, you hurt me. Yes! Yes! But it brought me pleasure. So it's good. You see the difference between good and evil. Come here. Listen, when we hit, it's good because it pleases us. But we have to avoid getting hit because it's... Evil? - Yes. You see, philosophy isn't so hard to understand. Come, we'll go do some good. Hey! Dummy. Ladies and gentlemen... No, no, save your applause for the rest of our show. You'll need it. As you know, variety itself is the show here. One moment, I have my ticket. Tonight, we're catering to all tastes! It's full? Will this do? What do we do, Inspector? We don't have tickets. We have better than that, Paul. A universal pass. It's good for everything. Opera, movies, restaurants, rock shows, strip clubs, massage parlours. Inspector? How did Florence take it when you broke up? Women bawl for nothing. She'll get used to it. She's not the first woman to be dumped. Inspector? - What? Florence! What is she doing there? Come, we'll go by the stage door. She'll still recognize you. Come on, move! Pardon me, is the seat taken? Thank you. Watch. He'll pay for it, I'm telling you. Excuse me. Do you want to tell me where he's hiding? Come on, where can he be? I'll have a drink. Oops! I'll have a little pick-me-up. No ice. Thank you, thank you. OK, Paul, there's nobody. Come on, follow them, follow them, follow them. Make sure you're not spotted. Come on. Wait. Wait. That's a nice hat. We can't see anything in the hole, Inspector. Come on, go down. BACKSTAGE ...and his clownish musicians! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Careful! It shouldn't take long! - Where are we? How should I know? I hear them, I hear them. We're close. I can't see, Inspector. It's that way. It's that way! I didn't know local artists would be in our act. It's a North American custom. They even have an improv league. Come on, come. You know, Inspector. I've been dreaming of this since I was a kid. Of what? Being a clown? Singing. I see him, he's there. He's okay, it seems. There are as many cops here as at a police benefit show. What do you mean? Police! Police! Block the exits. Come, Paul, he's mine! He's mine! Eh? What's happening? No! It's me! Ouch! I'll... Bunch of thickheads! There are too many people. It's not me, it's not me! - Are you okay? Are you? What are you doing here? I wanted to see if everything was okay. I'm not a schoolchild! I can manage by myself! Will you stop babying me? Come. We have to get away from here. How did you follow me here? - The countess knew you were coming here. - How did she know? I didn't tell anybody. - She saw your ticket. I didn't think I'd shown it to her. She's here also? - Yes, she's inside. You were in the balcony? - Yes. Did you have time to see a well-dressed man go out... It's her! She's the one who gave me the ticket. What? - Yes. Let's follow them. What? - Dad, come, we'll take that car. Come on. - I'm telling you, come. Hey! You have no right to steal this car. We were here first. Go on, Dad, go on. You don't understand. We hide here waiting for people to come. Then, we steal their cash. That's good, guys. When I was small, my dad always came to fetch me at school. He was never late. Yet, he kept losing his car keys. - OK, we got it! Orgasmic, really. Incredibly enjoyable. You know, before I knew you, Ã‰douard, I didn't think I'd be so fond of strong emotions. It's certainly worth the modest fees our services cost you. Right? You deserve much more. Especially since our husbands are paying! What a brilliant idea to force them to bring us a ransom! And we still kidnap them! There, I see them! My dear, don't hold it against me. I'm sorry for your... protÃ©gÃ©. I hope he didn't suffer too much. Not at all. - Good. As luck would have it, the police has arrested two lunatics dressed as clowns. What? How is it possible? Ã‰douard? - Yes. Is something wrong, Ã‰douard? - No, no, no. We'll never catch up with them, with this clunker. - We don't have to catch up with them. We just want to see where they're going. We have to be pragmatic. Pragmatic. You understand? That is, turn away from abstract thought and turn towards concrete thought and effective action. Ã‰douard, I believe we're being followed! Really? How unfortunate! But don't fret, I've something here to remedy this foreseeable factor. GRENADE LAUNCHER - ROCKETS SMOKE - EXPLOSIVE NAILS, SOPORIFIC EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM Excellent idea, JosÃ©e. It really ends my day well. I couldn't have done better. Damn! The engine's flooded. Use that word again and I'll blow you away! What word, "flooded"? I knew it. These small cars are indestructible. Come. Get in. Christ. - Come on, get in. Damn, I'll have to write a report. Humiliated, Paul. Humiliated. Sixteen years working my arse off. No one even recognized me at the station. Inspector... - Sure, I was disguised, but still. I've never been so humiliated, Paul, never. Blind, short-sighted, a regiment of moles, a squad of ungrateful joes. Inspector, you should think of putting on your... A night in lockup, me, the pillar of the squad, the dean of the station. Inspector, don't forget... - Did you hear Johnson? "Did you see the fool who takes himself for Grasselli? It's true he looks like him. He looks like a clown." I have his badge number. Calling me a clown! I'll cook him up one, you can be sure of that. I'll tenderize him, and it won't be a cream pie. I'll put him through the meat grinder. "What we call the blues often is only an eclipse of our illusions and a flash of our lucidity." A flash of our lucidity... "Silence is..." You're so goddamn dumb! Go to hell. - You could have taken them the right size! For what stolen tires cost! We got a fine police force today, I'm telling you. Inspector, you still think it was Marleau? Because yesterday, he didn't do anything. I'm telling you it's him. He's a madman, capable of anything. Don't let me down, Paul. You promised. And I promise you we'll nab him. Inspector? You left too fast, Inspector. You forgot to change... Give me that! I have a feeling the radiator's leaking. You think? Come on, come on, go. OK, calm down! Calm down! What's happening? You were sleeping well. You had a clear conscience. What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to be gone for good? They turned down my resignation. They're forcing me to finish my contract. What contract? - It seems there's nobody to replace me. They won't get me again, I know the trick now. They make you sign a contract written in invisible ink. Many provisions you never saw start showing up! Leave me alone! Scram! I've enough problems, I don't want to hear about yours! OK, OK, take a deep breath. I know you'd rather not have a conscience. The easy life, no remorse. Don't worry. I used to be positive, I'm now passive. My contract forces me to be here, but I won't intervene anymore. I'm not raising a finger. I work to rule. That's it! Go away! Hello. Hello, Marleau? - Mister Lacroix? What time is it? Shit! I'm late for the shooting of AlumÃ©tal? No, no. AlumÃ©tal is postponed. I'm not calling you for that. You found me a new contract? - Listen, Marleau, things are bad. We have to see each other. It can't wait. We have to stop everything. You understand? I can be at your office in a half-hour. No, no! Not at the office, they would know. It's too dangerous. Meet me in an hour, and above all, don't tell anybody you spoke to me. Come alone, right? Hangar number 6, the set of yesterday's shoot. Don't write anything. Don't leave any trails. Yesterday's shoot. I know where it is. I'm an actor... No, it starts again. Come on! Wardrobe must have complained. They must think I stole it. It'll be hell to repair! What's... Never mind, I'll pay for it. What are we hearing? Is water seeping in? There he is! Paul, that's it! Something's going to happen, I can feel it. Go, Paul! Slow down, slow down. - Not so loud, Inspector, I've a headache. Dad? Dad? At least he sleeps like a log. But he snores like a rhino. He's not here. We'd hear him. You know, I was totally wrong about your father. He's not at all the man I had imagined. Too bad. Still... - Hey. He's very gifted. He's lucky. I envy him for that. - Do you want to tell me... Well, they wired him. Wait, what's that? Look, it's the Rolls Royce of yesterday! That's a piece of luck. Yesterday's lady in black, it's her. It's logical. Once rid of her husband, she takes control of his fortune. You understand? Totally, there's no doubt. It's a master coup. It's obvious. But who can we explain that to? Certainly not inspector Grasselli. Do you have an idea? Sorry to knock you out, JosÃ©e. You understand too fast. You force me to give you a handicap. We'll see each other at the finish line. In due course. "Nothingness is that hole of the being made of falls of the being-in-itself towards the oneself, by which is formed the being-for-itself." Wow! Hey, pinhead, do you understand that? I don't see what a bunch of beans has to do with that. Hey, somebody's coming. Wasn't I right, Paul? Look at him, look at him. Isn't that shady? It's still too early to squeeze him. But we can't cut down the cooking time. We'll let him stir the sauce and stay right on his tail. OK, come. Come on, come on. Shush! Paul, stop it! It's stuck, Inspector! Anybody here? Shut it up, Paul. Mister Lacroix? What's that racket, Marleau? Ah, you scared me. You're sure nobody followed you? That? It's nothing. Car alarms always go off for no reasons. I'm used to it. But Mister Lacroix, why are you leaving? Hey! Hey, Mister Lacroix? Wait! Mister Lacroix! These small cars are indestructible. Hop in, hop in. Goodbye! Goodbye! Where is he? I hear him, he's over there. - No, no. I've a good ear. He's over there. No. - Come on. Mister Lacroix, why do you hide from me? Mister Lacroix! Yoo-hoo! Mister Lacroix? Mister Lacroix? Mister Lacroix, don't be scared. Mister Lacroix? Mister Lacroix! Mister Lacroix? Mister Lacroix, give me another chance! You know, the trench coat wasn't really my fault. You were there. They didn't give me time to change. I can pay! Don't worry. I'll take care of all that! Mister Lacroix, I swear it'll change starting tomorrow. With you, I feel my career is taking off. I'll give you 20 per cent! Mister Lacroix? Mister Lacroix! Mister Lacroix, don't be scared. Yoo-hoo! Mister Lacroix? It's not fair! You have to give me an answer. Hey! I'll do the maximum. You'll see. You didn't hit too hard, I hope? He's an artists' agent. Those people are reputed for being hardheaded. To such a point? I didn't quite get what Ã‰douard is looking for. Why does he want us to do this? Geniuses have reasons that reason ignores. Very pretty your veil. - Thank you, dear. I'll give you 25 per cent. 30 per cent? Mister Lacroix? Marleau! Hey, let go of me, Marleau! The rope will break! - No way! I'll get you out of this! You'll see, it won't be long. I almost have it! - Marleau, it's become too dangerous. You have to quit the agency. Don't take it like that! It was your idea to meet here! Will you understand in the end? - You must swing! The commercial contracts, I'm not the one who found them. He gave them to me! He wields enormous influence and can impose you on the biggest advertising agencies. Damn, I let him stew in his own juice too long. He evaporated. Inspector. What's that, Paul? He hanged somebody. Not content with seeing him strangle himself, he hangs on him to make him suffer more. What did I tell you? Marleau's a madman. Yes, you were right, Inspector. Come on, come. I'm coming! Don't move, Marleau! Or I'll blast your arse! No! Don't come nearer! Nothing broken, Paul? Nothing, Inspector. But I feel funny. Yes. And it smells funny. Oh, my God! Hey, Marleau. He'll get away. Marleau, where are you? Marleau! I'll get you. You won't always get away like this. Are you okay, Mister Lacroix? Nothing broken? Don't touch me, Marleau. Will you finally understand it's too dangerous for me? Do you want me dead? Why do you say that? Things aren't so bad. Three ads in three months. My career's picking up, I feel it. - You didn't get it, Marleau. I don't want to see you at the agency. You hear? I'm no longer your agent. I just wanted to warn you. I've nothing to do with that. OK, OK, I took the money. But how could I know? He's too strong. What money? Who gave you the contracts? Who? Go away! Go away! Go away! Leave me alone! Marleau! I'll get you, Marleau! I'll finally get you, you'll see! We have to get out of here! AlumÃ©tal, AlumÃ©tal, AlumÃ©tal. WHO'S WHO Bryan Bouchard, president. He's through laughing at me. We're hiding. Well, he'll have a very, very nice surprise. FREE PARKING He'll pay for it. I'll take care of him. OK, let's go, Florence. What I don't understand, Inspector, is why does he take the seat of the man he's supposed to kidnap? Crime-wise, Marleau's sly. Smell the coffee, Paul. There never was a kidnapping during the show. You understand? Marleau knocks out his victims in the parking lot or elsewhere. Then, he dresses up to make it look like the victim's here during the show. When the lights go off, he removes his disguise. He becomes the innocent Marleau again. You see? Wizardry, like at the circus. Where is he? Where is he? Where is he hiding? Wait till I find him. Where is he hiding? You'll pay for it. It's in the bag. - Let's hurry up and go home. Those strong emotions have exhausted me. Ã‰douard's strategy is brilliant: threatening to kidnap our husbands if they refuse to pay a ransom. They're so tight-fisted! It's a dirty trick, but pleasant. There. I was forgetting the bag. Paul, he's no longer there. He's no longer there. Police! Nobody moves! Marleau, I got you, bastard! Come, show yourself! The club is surrounded. All exits are blocked! You don't stand a chance, Marleau! Come out with your hands up! - There's nobody, Inspector. He must have a costume, a false beard, something. Comb the hall. Nothing at all, Inspector. Nothing. What do you mean? Nothing. Come on. Inspector! I'll die. Oh, my love. My God, let my love... Giuseppe! Giuseppe! What are you doing here, my love? Why did you leave me, my big teddy bear? Forgive me, Giuseppe. Look, Inspector. The bullet stopped on your real wife's picture. Put that away, put that away! Ouch! Ouch! What is it? Ouch! Heavens! He's not my husband! - I warned you, ladies. This man is very dangerous. Ã‰douard Elkin? - Perhaps. But where is my husband? Patience. We'll see to that later. He's got it coming to him. I insist. It's my husband's turn. I already accepted that he be last. I don't want to wait anymore. - Come, my dear, your husband can wait a little. After all, he was not as bad as our men. Of course, you always had an eye on him. Ladies, ladies, please. So? Surprised to see me, Marleau? The ups and downs of life. You understood many things tonight, Marleau. Do you want to know the rest? Well, at this point... Well, I work for these ladies. Yes, I'm their adviser. I guide them in their criminal activities. You see, we grew weary of our sterile wealth. Our ordered existences and our husbands forever absent for business. Laze, caviar, limo! It's hard to be rich. We were bored. And to amuse ourselves, we decided to form an association... of malefactresses. Charming idea, don't you find? After all, crime is the least known of the Fine Arts. Some cultured minds need to devote themselves to it. It doesn't make sense! They could do good. You could help charities, the destitute, the homeless. I don't know. Well, it's true. No. It's precisely for the good of humankind that we commit evil. You see, in truth, Marleau, people feel they exist only through the misfortune that happens to them. People don't want to be happy. No, it's too distressing. We worry sick thinking it won't last. Plus, happiness makes one insipid. One never has anything interesting to tell. While all goes well with hardship. Everybody feels sorry for the unfortunate. In return, the latter feel appreciated, envied, supported. But happy people are to be pitied. They're so alone. Thus, for the welfare of humankind, we have to make as many as possible unhappy. You're just an... an intellectual! - Oh, no! Careful what you say, Marleau! Ladies, have you reached a verdict? A verdict? What verdict? - Marleau, don't play innocent. You're here before a tribunal duly constituted according to these ladies' ill will. Don't worry, justice doesn't drag its feet here. Ladies, your verdict. Guilty. - Guilty! Guilty. - Guilty. Guilty. Countess? You here? - Yes. What do you want? I also need strong emotions. Plus, I have a terrible weakness for people of wit and learning. Guilty? Guilty? Guilty of what exactly? It doesn't matter. We're always guilty of something. Guilty of being scared. - Guilty of lacking audacity. - Guilty of mediocrity. Pride and selfishness. Self-centredness, vanity. Guilty of getting it wrong. Guilty of knowing too much. - Come on! I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything bad! I'm just trying to rebuild my life. I'm not harming anybody! That's not justice. I don't even have a lawyer to defend me. A lawyer? A lawyer to defend you, Marleau? How foolish you are, Marleau! Well, so be it, I'll be your lawyer. No, don't make that face, Marleau. You're in very good hands. Unlike a lawyer, your fate is very close to my heart. Ladies, I appeal. I want to introduce a new witness. I support the defendant's request. Let's make the pleasure last. All right. Let's hear the witness and be done with it. I call JosÃ©e Marleau, the only child of the accused. What are you doing here? Come closer. Speak with confidence, child. Here, he can't do anything to you. Tell us the truth about your father. When I was small, he was never home. He never had time to play with me. He was shooting his TV series. I didn't like television because of an evil bandit. And one day, I was old enough to realize the bandit who scared me so much was my father. That's why I dropped everything, JosÃ©e. It's not my fault. It's my face. All they ever gave me were bandit parts. In school, all the kids hated you, Dad. And they took revenge on me. I still loved you. I tried to get close to you. But I realized you were a weakling. You cultivated your failures. You're a loser, Dad. Thank you! The witness has been heard. Do you agree to review your verdict? No. The verdict is upheld. - Sorry, Marleau, I tried my best. I know. It's true. I'm a failure. I never achieved anything. It's in my blood! I'm hopeless, pathetic! I don't deserve to exist! That's good! That's good, Marleau! Very good! You have to repent. It's very, very, very good. It'll be much easier for you to accept what's awaiting you. What I have in store for you is a very special treatment. Nobody move! Hands up! Enough with parlour games. You lost! Paul, Paul, did you see the fine brochette? It gives me an appetite. It's the greatest coup of my life. If I don't become police general with that... Bravo, Inspector. - Paul, take care of Marleau. Come, guys. We'll try and figure out who those pretty ladies in black are. JosÃ©e? I know I've been a bad father, but do you still love me a little? Come, Dad, you know I don't believe a word of what I said. The idea was to gain time. Look, I found this bug in your place. I know. Grasselli tapped my phone as if I were a bandit. For once, it's lucky. Without it, the police wouldn't have come. So, madam, could I have your name and address? It's just to please you that I yield to force. You're my hero, Dad. But drop your loser's face. You piss me off! What distressing lack of imagination, Marleau! You disappoint me, despicably calling the police at the sublime moment of my vengeance. Disappointing, very, very disappointing. How's that? I didn't do anything! I'm giving you a last chance. You and me, on equal terms. - How, on equal terms? Behind the columns, my spare chairs. Follow me if you dare. Watch it, he's running away! Catch him! Don't just stand there! He'll run away. Come! Come. Quickly! There. Don't shoot! I want him alive. I want him to come clean. Hurry up! To the cars! You, in the paddy wagon, wait for the women. The others, you go ahead! Watch out! Move away! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Watch it! Life makes no sense. It doesn't mean anything. Everything is empty. We're like prisoners at the bottom of a cave. All we see are the shadows of those outside on the walls of the cave. And we think that's the truth. The truth is nothing but subjectivity. Damn, what's happening to you? Have you lost contact with reality? You're right. It's that existence in itself has no reason to exist. You and me, we're nothing! We don't count. On the scale of the Universe, we're two big zeroes. - Yes, well, silence your reason. I'm not just an anonymous fly dropping on the highways of the Universe. Is that clear? Isn't it disgusting? Not content with Natives and Blacks, now they run after the handicapped. Step on it! - I can't go any faster! Patience, patience. I want him alive. What does he want? What do you want? - Everything is in place. Perfect. We got him, the roadblock is in place. Watch it, the roadblock! Who assigned me such a bunch of incompetent morons? A crippled in a wheelchair and you can't stop him! Bunch of idiots! Zeroes! You're just bumblers! Don't you see anything? Peabrains! You need glasses! Open your eyes! - My teddy bear! Darling! Darling! - What is it? Look. Watch out, watch out, everybody in formation! We'll pluck the little duck. We'll stuff his wings with slugs. Watch out! Shit! Damn! Hey, it's my dad! It was the handsome Paul Leboeuf! How's that, the "handsome" Paul Leboeuf? Paul. Yes! - I got him! Could someone go see my dad over there? Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Mission accomplished, Inspector. Bravo. Paul. Paul? Wake up, Paul. Paulo? Paul! I hope he has nothing broken. Paul! Careful, be careful. He's injured. What about my dad? Do something, and hurry up. Come, everybody. Bring the stretcher. I'll take care of you. - Yes? Yes. Yes. - Yes? Still, life is a very curious thing for those who know to look at it between midnight and sunrise. Are you okay? - Well! I could be better. Don't worry, it's just a difficult time to go through. Who are you? I'm your new conscience. The other finally got his transfer. A new conscience! A lot of good that does me! It gives you a funny face anyway. We'll get along fine, you and me. We're of the same blood. If you need me, I'll always be behind you like your shadow. - Excuse me, just one question: who appoints you, consciences? Who's responsible? That? If you saw our administration, you'd understand why humankind has long had problems of conscience. Where? There. Inspector, he's that way. Dad? Well, will you get me out of here? My neck is breaking. Dad, you're alive? Yes, I think. - He's really lucky. Lucky, me? No but... - Come on, get him out of there. Is it true that I'm lucky? Ouch! Ouch! Ã‰douard? I got it! I got it! I got it! That's it, I got him! Right? I'm avenged. Tell me, dear, did you have something to do with the arrival of the police? Me? I only want your good, Ã‰douard. Don't doubt it. Besides, I've come round to what you think of Marleau. He's dangerous. In the future, I hope you'll avoid him. No, no. No, I haven't said my last word. Save it for a better day, Ã‰douard. In the circumstances, saying anything foolish could be fatal to us. And... those ladies' money is in my car. Come, sweetie, let's get out of here before they try to stop us. - Yes!
