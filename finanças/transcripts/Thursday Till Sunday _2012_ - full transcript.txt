Not about us. - No? - No, you cheater. - Little vampire and eagle egg? - Yes! Yes! - No, a story of you as a kid. - Yes, when you was a kid... - I don't know. - Did I tell you about the Union Club? - Yes. - And when I cried 'cause they told me my name wasn't Nano? - Look at my row.

And I was swimming, and I started getting far from the shore. And I was swimming, swimming, swimming. And I saw people further into the sea. So I thought: if there's people there it must be more fun there, so I will go there. So I kept on swimming, swimming, and when I looked... They were all surfers, with their boards, and I didn't have one... And suddenly a huge wave... ...knocked me around. Another wave... Another wave... And I sunk. I sunk all the way down, down, down... And I suddenly looked up, like this. And I saw light. And then, I looked down, like that. And I saw myself, I was there ﬂoating, facing down. So I swam down... and I sort of... joined back with my body. - Get out of here. - Hey, what I'm telling is the truth. I was dying and I reacted. If I hadn't, that was it for me, and you guys wouldn't exist. 'What do you reckon? - And, the leg-munching piranha... - He walked away, he was going away. So I run after him, but wasn't sure if he was him or not. And I touch his shoulder and say: "Sandro, is that you?" And he replies: "Yes... it's me." So I get very nervous, and say: "I'm so thrilled". "Thanks Sandro! Thanks for your songs." And he says: "Ana... I will always be with you." - Excellent. - Remember when you threw my guitar off the balcony? - By accident, plus I got you a new one. - Yes, a new one. Very good. That's the one I still own. Juan is the one who would host us in France. - And the offer is still good, if you want to... - I still teach baroque dance there. - Yes? - Yes. - Still with Eva? - Yeah, with Eva. Lucia! Go to sleep! - I'm not tired. - Well, just close your eyes and you'll get sleepy. - Another cup of wine? - Alright. - Alright, thanks. - I will open another bottle. - What's wrong? - I'm scared. - Scared of what? - I don't know. - Nothing's wrong. We are just a few steps from you. - Hey, hand me the water. - I don't know where it is. - It was right next to you. - No, it's not here. - Sure? - Yes. - Out! Alright, out, out. - Mom! - Out! Out!

Very good. Rest. - ...He leaves and runs into his buddy: - Here, here! - Manuel! Over here! - I have it! C'mon, over there, there! - Go there, Jose, there. - C'mon, dad! You're terrible. - C'mon! Oh, cheated! - Here I go! - Over here! - Oh, the football... - And you would come to Chile by yourselves? - I don't know. Look, a robin. - Where? - Right there. Don't you ever wear shoes? - No. - Look... touch. - It's hard. So lucky... - What? - The birds. - ...so I was at a mountain, it was horrible, and I had to choose. I was riding a can and they first showed me a cliff. Then some tigers... ...and then a cave where they wanted to kill me with guns. - Damn, what a bad dream. - They made me choose. - So? - I told them I wanted none... ...but I still preferred getting thrown off the cliff. ...But I didn't tell them. Dad. - Yes? - 'Was the story of the parcel just a lie? - No. If we drive a couple of hours more, I think we will get there. - We could build a small house there. - Grab the wheel, steady. Like this, look Here and there. Steady, alright? - Alright. - Look. That's the brakes over there. - And the gears? - No. Before the gears you must learn how to brake, Ok? - Alright. - Focus. - Yeah. - That's it! I will tell you when to brake. - Faster! - Go ahead. Brake! Well done! Very good. 'Was it hard? - No. - No? Good. - Mom, can we go to the beach when it rains? - Better when there's sun. - It's just that when it rains, coins rise up over the sand. José told me so... - Good. - No! Get down. - But... - Down. - Damn... - Bye. - A pleasure. - Bye. - Well, let's talk back in Santiago. - Right. - Bye. - Bye, José. Have a good time. - Thanks, bye. - Bye. - Bye, good luck. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - It doesn't show here. - He didn't ride on the roof rack. - Who didn't? - José. - Well, another time. - ...tragedy in the third province... ...a 23-year old young man suffered an accident when his motorbike... ...slipped off the road when he drove to the National Park... ...his corpse was found... - It must be the kid we saw in the river. - It might not be. - He seemed lost, that kid. You're out! Start! You're out! - Dad, can we come with grandma when the desert ﬂowers bloom? - Yeah, sure. - Can I call her? - There's no signal. - Dad, I'm thirsty... - Thirsty for justice? - C'mon dad, it's always the same... - Look over there. I don't like when it looks like that. - How? - Round. - Mom! Look! - Be careful. - They will die. - No. They last for a couple of days. - I will rent that apartment. - Why did we even come...? You already rented it. You had already rented it... - Ana! - You know what? Just go away! - Mom! - And your parents? Huh? - Over there. - They are taking a stroll. - Be careful with trucks here. They drive fast around here. - Lucia! - Lucia! Wait up, stay there! Did you see her? - Can you carry me? - What? - Can you carry me on your shoulders? I'm tired. - Ok. - Ana... - Get in the car... - Ana! Let's go!
