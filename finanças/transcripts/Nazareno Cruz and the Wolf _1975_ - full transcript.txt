Jeremias! Jeremias! Don´t let your woman have that baby! Six children the Lord gave you... The seventh Devil's blood will suck... and werewolf will born! A red bug... bug... bug... has killed his wi... fe ...fe with a knife with the tip of a needle...... It ripped out her guts and sold them... For twenty... for twenty... the warm guts of my wife...fe...fe... Jeremias! Don´t let your woman have that baby! And so it was this story began... the most real in the world... So it was this tale began, that the Devil told my grandfather, and as he told to me, I'm telling to you. The father and his six sons move away, through hills and water, forgetting the Witch's omens, whom wasn't a bad woman. Rather,a knowing woman... of the tricks that the Devil pull... or the Lord, according to the circunstance. The good mother stayed in the ranch, waiting fos his men and the six children... who would never comeback... and to her bad luck... pregnant! several moons succeded the tragedy, y one night Damiana felt the pains of delivery. And the wise chorus of the old woman of the town... advise to wore the ranch in mourning... so that the Lord had mercy and send some light. We hope that a baby girl is waiting her turn in our friend's belly... to come to suffer with the mortals. Well, let's now praise a little bit to the Lord... so that this poor girl can have a little baby girl... to help her with the houseworks and to be good and useful... The poor girl, who doesn't have a husband anymore, is a good neighbour... and the six children must be watching from the sky now. Let's pray then, so that a baby girl is born. Someone who knows how to make "arrope", who can make "cujas", that sweeps and be good. Don't let the little baby be a boy... because the poor little boy is seventh... and who gave birth to seven, gave birth to a werewolf... A boy was born.. werewolf will be. Hey, grandson! You go and tell... that Nazareno and Cruz will be his name, Nazareno and Cruz will be his name... so that the little can have some relief... It would be better to shut your mouths rather than doors and windows! Every filthy word that comes out of them... is a eschelon to hell! They scare of my little angel... when they should run from their thougts... and scare themselves from every daily action they make! They say hello with a smile and they hate each other! They greet the neighbour when the goat gave birth, but deep in their heart they only wish... that the pest comes to their barnyard! They look in Church with respect and revere... to the one who gives the grander handout, when they know that the one with more sins must pay more! You wouldn't do this if my husband and my sons were alive! ¿When will he be a wolf, Lechiguana? When your daughter turns into a sheep! Where will I take my goats, Lechiguana on full moon nights? To the same place where your poor woman hides... when you get drunk and beat... your poor animals and sons! Why have you came down here, Lechiguana? To be the godmother of your son, woman... to be the godmother of your son...! Milk and goat awaits for us in my ranch to celebrate! Is God fair, Lechiguana? Why me, Lechiguana? Why me? Frogs and toads will musicians be! Frogs and toads... Those can really sing and never fail! How will you call him? Nazareno... Nazareno and Cruz... like you told me to! I baptise you, Nazareno Cruz... in the name of the Father, the Son... and the Holy Gosth, amen. And Nazareno grew, evading omens and sorcery, to the amaze of the whole region, who vainly awaits to see him on a full moon night... roaming through the meadows in the form of a wolve. And so little by little... Nazareno won the respect and warm of the populate, the admiration of his equals and his elderly one. It was a pleasure seing him on the "rastra", handling the "mancera". Watching him tame a colt was a party. No one like him to mark the cattle... or tiyng a mare... And when he came to the little town, he play like he were a wolve... and howled at the full moon... Hey, Nazareno! How does the wolf do when there's a full moon? And as he watched everybody laugh, he enjoyed it. Hey, Nazareno, this night there's a full moon! Nazareno, Nazareno, don't you want to make a fire to jump over tonight? Everybody sais: war bad. Nazareno, would like for me to make you a fire so you could jump over tonight? I make the best bonfires. The greatest. I mean the greatest, ok? Here... take. I make the nicest fires! Would like for me to make you a fire so you could jump over tonight? I make the nicest fires! Would like for me to make you a fire so you could jump over tonight? Griselda, i make the fire that last the more. Griselda, how pretty you are! If you like I'll make you a fire to jump over tonight. How pretty you are, Griselda! How pretty you are, Griselda! How pretty you are, Griselda! How pretty you are, Griselda! Griselda, how pretty you are! I make the nicest fires, Griselda. How pretty you are, Griselda! If you like I'll make you a fire to jump over tonight. I don't know who is he... What...? You're incredible... incredible... Nazareno... How does the wolf do when there's a full moon? What...? It's not good to laugh on fridays... They say that one cries on mondays. I know you... I remember you, you were at the party. I like fire. What were you doing here? Awaiting for you... Yes, yes... awaiting for you. I met your brothers and your father, for a long time they were on my domains. It was only after a herd, and a long time... that they were called to better field. And it was that way that I took interest in your business, seing you all alone with your good mother... you two so alone... with all that disgrace. I told to myself... it's time to go and see Nazareno... and help him to escape his tragedy. Tragedy? Of being the seventh, of being the seventh. Tomorrow there's a full moon, Nazareno, and you will roam the fields in the form of a wolve... Stop, it's true. Stop, it's true... It's true. But... what are you saying? You've have fallen in love, Nazareno... And that in you it's no good. Because love,something that's bliss in every being, it will mark you with tragedy. Mighty clear the Lechiguana spoke several years ago. When you were only a scream, a soft and warm shaking camin out from a womb... she advise your mother: Look after love toward people, look after love, he can never fall in love. Because the day in wich love comes to him... new blood will boil in his veins... and that same boil will mix his his eager... and he'll be a mad and chased wolve... on those nights of full moon. Who are you? And you had fallen in love, Nazareno... and you can't escape the curse. Tomorrow there's a full moon... and you will roam the fields in the form of a wolve. But I didn't came here only to bring you that news, I don't use the play the sad role of a messenger. I have come here to save you. If you follow my advise... nothing will happen to you, quite the contrary. - If you gave up love... - To Griselda... If you gave up love... seven carts of gold and precious stones... every seven days will be at your door for you. And you'll be seventy times seven powerful and rich. Wo are you...? And so that you trust me, I bring you this advance. All this is yours, Nazareno. You can take it. You can take it for your ranch. Caressing the gold you'll forget your sorrows, and you'll never be a wolve... on those nights of full moon. - What? - But, who are you? Who are you? I did notice the sound of a snake when you talked! - What, Nazareno, What? - You lie! You lie! You lie! Son, you've fallen in love! Is it true? Have you fallen in love? Visits. Daughter, where were you? My godson... My poor little godson... - Goddaughter, watch out for my little candels. - Allright, grandfather. GOdmother, your blessing... That God controls your hungers and tame you... sheep or shepherd. Come in, my son, come in! So, how are you, godfather? Leave that damn old man alone... He has spent forty years saying he's dead... but he sucks more than dry land! He has the idea that he must be watch over... and there's no way of getting him up. He's a fucking bump! The stranger was here... and he brought me gifts for the nieces. SO... Is it true? Griselda is pretty, no? Yes. There's no spell that can fix this. Not even the Devil has the knowledge. You must expect whatever happens all alone. If you have already chosen between love and gold, may God have mercy on your sweet little soul! Well, bye. with a knife with the tip of a needle... with a knife with the tip of a needle... For twenty, for twenty the warm guts... Goodbye, goodbye Fidelia. Goodbye... A little red bug.. bug... bug... has killed his wife.. fe... fe... with a knife with the tip of a needle... It ripped out her guts and sold them... Griselda! Griselda! Griselda, Griselda! Griselda, Griselda! Griselda, Griselda! - Griselda! - It's Nazareno. How does the wolf do when there's a full moon? Tonight there's a full moon, Nazareno. Oh, if the wolf came to my door! Griselda! - And if it were true...? - What? I mean, the jokes... That tonight when full moon appears i'll turn into a wolve. Will you still love me... or will you be scared of me? Don't laugh. How does it feel, Griselda? A son... A son... A son... A son... I'll take care of him, i'll take care of him, i'll take care of him. I'll take care of him. - A son... - I'll take care of him., i'll take care of him... Griselda! Griselda... I'm scared... There's still time, Nazareno. How does it feel... to have a s child? I don't really know it. It was so subtle... so subtle was the punishment... Have you already chosen? You've chosen love... In nómini Patris...

Just one look from you and the promise of a child... are worth crossing all hells... Nazareno is the killer! Nazareno is the killer! Just one smile from you... and all my worries disappear... My child, you must try to not be seen. Maybe... if the clouds, my friends, stay and the rain persist... hiding the moon... we could be together a little more...

Nazareno is suffering his tragedy for loving Griselda... - Tell them I didn't mean to do that. - Come on! - Tell them! - Come on, my love! Tell them I didn't mean to do that... No, my God! They'll kill you, they'll kill you, my love! My love, come on, come on! No, please, my love, they'll kill you! What do I care? What do I care? What do I care?
