Give us the money and nothing will happen to you! Fine, but don't do anything stupid! Shut up and walk! You, keep your eyes open! Guys, you're looking for a lot of trouble! - Open that drawer! - OK... but I warned you. Someone is going to get very angry about this! There's still time, guys! Leave and I'll forget about this. This store is under the Moran protection. You shouldn't have done this! Hurry up! Someone's coming! - You won't get away... - Let's go! We're trapped! Let's look for another exit. Come on, come on! Let's try here. - They're gone... - We'll catch them sooner or later. There's no need to call the police, Mr. Coen. Yes, I agree. The problem is that they took more than $5000, including the money I'd put aside to pay for your protection. Don't worry, we trust you. You've always been very punctual. Let's just say that we'll pretend that the money was stolen directly from us. They'll spit them out! You said there were two of them, did you know them? I'd never seen them before. I don't think they're from this neighborhood. I'd know them. Sooner or later everyone comes into my store. They're from somewhere else. Maybe from Brooklyn or Little Italy. They went out from the back. They must be experts. I don't think they're professionals. They were almost more scared than me. They might have been Puerto Rican or maybe Italians. They looked like junkies. You should have seen the eyes of one of them. He looked like a maniac! - Where are we? - Quiet. I think we're in a porno shop. Hi, Archie, I'm glad you called, I was about to close the store. I'm getting the hell out of here for a couple of days. To the country. Listen, I don't owe you an explanation. No, I won't tell you where. No, if you come see me I won't be able to rest. Of course you're my man. I said no! - What shall we do, Ricko? - Let's wait till she leaves. I'll call you as soon as I come back. Fine! Come on, Archie! - She won't stop talking! - Let's go over there. Bye! Help me tie her up! Fine, as long as you won't scream. There's $300 in the drawer. Take it and let me go. - Are you alone? - Yes. - Is Archie coming to pick you up? - No, luckily for you. Bob, stay with her. I'll go see if the coast is clear. Cute! Can you show me how it works? You don't need a brain to figure it out. Bitch! Shut the fuck up! Asshole! I've had it with you! Isn't it enough that you put us in this mess? - Idiot! - Let me go, Ricko, you're hurting me! I swear I had no idea! I was told that that store wasn't under anyone's protection! No? Well that store is under Archie Moran's protection. Do you know what this means, you piece of shit? I was an asshole to trust you. Those two were certainly two of Moran's men. They're still out there. Why don't we give it a shot? After all we're two against two. Except that they are more clever than us. You can't be sure of it. In any case we can't stay in here forever. We must find a way to get out of here as quickly as possible. No, Mr. Moran, they weren't from this neighborhood. They're just some lowlifes or they wouldn't have dared! In any case were keeping an eye on things and sooner or later we'll catch them. Fine. Let's go. So apparently you're a friend of Archie Moran. Apparently. Good for you! Archie! - How good of a friend are you? - Mind your own business! - Were you waiting for a call? - No. It's better if she answers or they could get suspicious. Did you hear him? Move! Hello? Archie? You again? What do you want now? Near by, at Coen's? No, I didn't know. When did it happen? No, I didn't see anybody here. I'm sure of it. The problem is that you don't understand me when I speak. Yes, I'm nervous, OK? No, it's not about you. It's just that I still have to get ready to leave. No, if you come here I'll know how it will end up. You'll make me spend the weekend in bed with you. I told you, when I come back we'll talk about it. Of course I'm going by myself! Are you jealous? You're so stupid! You know that you're my only man. It's just that I need to be by myself. I can assure you there's no other reason. Yes, of course. Fine. I'll talk to you when I come back. Bye, Archie. If you act like that again I'll kill you! Good girl, I see you understand the situation. Dirty Pig! What did he think he was doing? Sure he's a pig and he's also a little nuts. But you're not so much better selling this stuff. Men like it. You're all pigs! Sure, but someone like you shouldn't mind so much... if a man sticks something in between your legs. Not a word or I'll kill you. I'll be right there! - Good-evening. - Good-evening, Martin. Mr. Moran asked us to come check if everything was OK here. Yes, Martin, everything's OK. Is it because of the burglary next door? Moran told me over the phone. Things that happen, but we'll find them sooner or later. - As you can see Mr. Moran cares for you. - Yes, even too much. Well, you're partners and this porno shop is a gold mine. - We're going to go check the area. Good-bye. - Good-bye, Martin. - What should we do? - We're trapped. Come up with something, Ricko! We have to get out of here before those two call the rest of the gang. How are we going to get out of here? I'll go find a car and bring it to the front. As soon as I arrive you two come out quietly. - Everything has to appear normal. - OK, Ricko. - Let me go, I won't say anything. - Would you believe it if you were us? - There's a lot of cool stuff in this store. - Serve yourself. Don't provoke me! I was sent to jail for two years for rape! I'm sorry. - No problem. - I'll clean you up. Please, let me go. Go on. You could say that I ran away. - I... - Come on, let me go. Please! I'll keep my mouth shut. I promise. I didn't even see you. Are you afraid of your friend? No, of course you're not afraid. Bob, please! Yes, yes, yes... Yes... you'd like that, wouldn't you? But I won't fall for these little tricks! Whore! - Ricko, did you steal a car? - No, it's too risky. We'll take hers. - Hey! Where did you park it? - Fine, as long as we get this over. The car is in the parking lot behind the block. - The keys are in my bag on the counter. - Get them, Bob. You'll come with us. Give it here. You're our life insurance. I'll take a couple of souvenirs! Hey! Wait! Here are the keys. I locked the store for you. You know, with the kind of people that go around these days! Sure! - Which one is it? - The one over there. Hey! What's going on? Nothing! I'm not in the mood for jokes, my friend! It's better if you take her car. It doesn't have an alarm! Look at the kind of people she goes out with! Look at this stuff! Oral sex: what is it? - I don't know, ask her. - What is it, miss? Stuff for perverts. That means it's for you, Bob. Thank you, miss. - Is this a tour guide around New York? - We're going to see a friend, OK? Do you mind? Bob? Hey Ricko! I've disguised myself so that no one can recognize me. Don't bother, everyone knows you're a dick head! It's hot stuff! This is it, take it or leave it. You decide. I want the money at the moment of delivery. No, I make the price. Fine, whenever you want. You know you're not supposed to come here, Bob. Just a minute. We brought you the money. Fine, let's go. The money? Are you that big piece of black shit? Good idea to rob that store! What's wrong with him? Is he nuts? Don't ask me. Ask him what's wrong! Maybe he doesn't like niggers. Listen to me, nigger, because of you, Moran's men are after us. Find us a place to hide or I'll kill you! Am I clear? Chill out, my friend. With that thing pointed to my head I can't think. - You better try! - Sure! You have to leave New York. Thanks, but I already knew that. Are you trying to fool me? Go to Canada, they'll never find you there! Tomorrow is Sunday. There's a million tourists going back and forth from the border. It shouldn't be hard to go by. Not bad, nigger, but what about until tomorrow? Go to Michigan and find a place in the country to hide. - The next day you'll pass the border. - It's an idea. - There's a house we can go to. - Unbelievable. - You bring these. - No, I'm not coming. Yes you are, nigger. This way if Archie Moran's men find us you'll be the first one to get killed. Let's go! Don't you want to see if everything works out, nigger? If everything goes smoothly we'll divide in three. - I'm a good white man. - And I'm an unlucky nigger. Who's she? - Moran's girlfriend... a sort of passport. - Passport? I'll get my gun. It's not a good idea to leave it around like that, nigger. It's a long way... but if you take the interstate you'll be at Niagara Falls tomorrow morning. There's a lot of traffic. These are all people who go rest for the weekend... while I have to stay all day stuck... in this damn gas station. That's life, my friend. - Here, there's nothing else. - It's the same for me. - Do you need to drink? - No, but I need to go to the washroom. - Excuse me, where's the washroom? - Right there! I can do it on my own. What if you run away? - From where? I'm not a magician! - One can never be too sure! You know what I found out? That when you're scared you get excited. You get excited! You're scared about what Archie will do to you because you touched me. If you want to wash up... Wake up! I'm tired. Frank, just one little fuck and you get dead tired! That's all you think about. Buy yourself a vibrator and have fun on your own. - You're such an asshole, Frank. - Thanks for the company. - Hi! Did you sleep well? - No, it was too hot. It's not the heat! You should have brought a boyfriend too. I don't care about getting humped like an animal. I do. - Where's the sugar? - Here. What the hell did you put in here? The coffee was old, we need to buy some. - Why? How long do you want to stay here? - I don't mind it. Let's see if there's anything to eat. Is it that you like women? - It would only disgust me. - Why? I tried it and it's not bad at all. You should put some milk in it. - Was that a proposal? - No, I have a man. You see, Sue... shit, it's not easy to explain... - How could you not understand me? - I understand very well! I don't keep it tight to... to be difficult. It's that I don't want... I don't give a shit about a collection of fucks. The day that I'll open my legs I'll have to know why I do it and with whom. Too bad, you don't know what you're missing! Fine, let's just drop it. Believe me, Faye, if you go on like this you'll miss out on life. The problem is that you take things too seriously. Especially sex. Faye, did you hear that? No, what? It's strange, I thought I heard a car. I was saying that you're stupid to give it so much importance. Be good, girls, and nothing will happen to you. Who are they? - Who are they? - Shut up! - Frank! - Stop it! Good for you! Against two women and with a gun in your hands! You have to shut the fuck up! Hey, Ricko, we're settled now. That's three with her. So we each have a woman. - Cut it out! Can't you see I'm thinking? - We thought the house was empty. We just stopped here to sleep we didn't burn his house! We didn't ruin anything. You can check it if you want. Do you want to scare them to death, you hypocrite? No one asked you anything. - You're taking this too far! - You're hurting me! Let me go! Stop it! What the fuck is going on? - Is anyone else here, Sammy? - No, no one else. Look, we're not criminals, we just finished high school. We spend our holidays going around places. Did you hear her? We're students, not thieves, goddammit! Listen to that language and he even goes to school! Good for you. You find an empty house and you spend your holidays in it. Please, we'll get our stuff and leave right away. We won't bother you longer. No, you're making it too easy, baby. We'll tell you when you can go. Is that right, Sammy? And that's only if we'll let you go. Bob, keep an eye on them and make sure they don't try to leave. Let's take a look around. You keep still. We're lucky, Sammy, a truck with a Canadian plate. If you also add that they're more lenient on the border during the weekend... Just wait till we get out of this mess and then you can say that we're lucky. - Are you scared, nigger? - No, but try not to sleep with that woman. Moran would get pissed. You think so? He's already quite angry with us. And now he's mad at you too. Have they killed someone? I don't know, but they're dangerous people. You must be careful. Who's not behaving well? No talking! Everybody must be quiet like in school! I don't want to hear a single word! I bet you were the one talking, Miss Strode. What should I do to you now? Don't tell me you're embarrassed. Let me see how good you are. What a number, guys, it's called... how do you call it? Oral sex. They don't teach this in school, guys. I never liked school. Teachers never did these kind of services. What's that face, guys? We were kidding. We were only pretending, unfortunately! Really! Could you really see me do such things with a woman that looks like my mother? No, not for the age... my mother is a whore! OK, I'm convinced. Let's see if the papers are in order. It would be stupid to get stopped by the police for this. What are we going to do with those three? Well, we can't just leave them here. Too bad for them. After all... I didn't ask for them to butt in our business, right? Right, but who says they'll shut up once we get out of here? Why should we care if once we're gone they'll tell them where we were? Don't you think? I never liked studying. You throw away the best years of your life without concluding anything. One can earn more money with just a gun in one's hand than with three degrees. No, please! Is he your boyfriend? Let him beg me. Didn't you hear me? - Please... - Louder, I can't hear you! Please, I beg you! Leave her alone! Let's go! Look at them! You're not a very good house wife. I would have cooked them more. I don't think you used to get this spoiled wherever you're used to staying. Where? In prison? Did you know that they're the best cooks in the world? This makes me proud of being an American. Did you call me? - Is everything OK? - Great! I talked to them so now you can be sure they'll stay calm. - What about the phone? - I'll unplug it. That looks good. What a wonderful host! - Would the lady do some for me too? - All you've got to do is ask. Make two more! Call me when it's ready! We should think of the others too. Is there enough food? Enough to explode... - I'm dying from the heat. - Sorry... Great, huh? - For whoever needs it. - Come on! Who would you like? All three of them! - Him too? - Why not? Do you go with faggots too? If you only knew how hard life is in my neighborhood! Bring them to the kitchen. Lunch is ready! Did you hear him? Come on, babes, food! - Look at this mess! - They're kids! - Now I need to take a shower. - Go ahead! Pretend I'm not here. Look! I've been a hostage and a maid, a striptease is not included! Don't get mad or you become ugly. They went at it hard here! Leave the door open! Now go ahead on your own. It's too tight for both of us. - Thanks. - No problem. - Well? - It's certain it was those two. We must warn Mr. Moran that they took his girlfriend. ...so they are camped nearby. The exceptional heat that has taken over New York... has led more than two million residents to leave the city. In spite of the many precautions and controls set up by the police, there have nonetheless been a number of incidents on the streets. Now more news... Did you hear that? It seems that in New York there's nothing but murders and all the rest. They don't even mention us. With more than one-hundred crimes a day? We're just a small number in the statistics. Thanks. You're such a loser! It's the third game I win. - Are you doing it on purpose? - No, it's a stupid game. I don't like it. Well, I like it a lot, so we'll do one more. Or would you rather I had fun with your girlfriend? OK. I can't stand it any longer. I have to go too, but I'm afraid they'll see us. We have to go to the bathroom. All three together? - Will you go with them? - Let's have them choose. You want us to piss on ourselves? Let's go! The chicks found they're hen! Hey, Sammy, make sure they don't do anything stupid. I saw you, you fucking bastard! What's wrong? You're doing it on purpose, you dirty piece of shit! Let him be! Did you hear me, Bob? Put that knife away! Calm down, I don't want any trouble, OK? I feel trapped locked in here! I can't stay calm. You must be patient. We'll be in Canada tomorrow. I promise we'll enjoy ourselves. Yes, but couldn't we start enjoying ourselves now? There's three whores in the other room! We could get one each. I like the blonde one. Let me do some dirty stuff to her and I'll be good, I promise. Let me try, please! Hey, you wet your pussy! - Asshole! - What language for a girl like you. You're a good girl. I saw it right away. We could be friends me and you. Intimate friends! What do you say? I'm serious. Why don't you leave her alone. She's not what you think. I don't think anything. - She's a virgin. - What? - I said she's a virgin. - Shit! A virgin! - Do you think it's strange? - Are you kidding? Do you think it's normal at your age? You'll end up getting sick. Believe me, you've got the face of a little whore. And don't get hurt if I tell you, OK? It's not so common to have the face of a whore. Lets see if the rest lives up to it. Not bad! You sure are looking fine. - Why don't you leave her alone? - You shut up! Let's see the rest. That's it! Is the show over? OK, end of part one. Go! What a show! Hello? Mr. Moran? No, you don't know me but I have to tell you something important. A certain Lorna left a message for Archie Moran written on a fifty dollar bill. I found it not long ago in the trash bin. What? Mr. Moran? Oh, it's you. I was saying that I found a fifty dollar bill with a message from Lorna to you. I don't know when she left it. Hello? What? Yes. I work in a gas station on the freeway up north. There's also the name of a town. I'll read it to you... - Who could it be? - Did they find us? How the hell do I know? Take them to the other room and don't make them move! OK. Did you hear what Ricko said? Hurry up! I'm going to run away. No, that's stupid. - Stop, you fucking bitch! - Go see what's going on! - Where are you going? Come with me. - Let me go! - Don't move! - Let me go! I said don't move! Quiet! You're all in it together! But I'm going to kill you. All of you! This way, please. We've been trying to call all morning but no-one answered. Of course no-one answered! The phone was unplugged! You could have told us immediately. You're right but as I was saying we were moving some furniture... and it must have been unplugged by mistake. I meant to call you but I forgot. Just for this once we won't give notice. Thanks! Would you like something to drink? - A cold beer, what about you Nick? - Yes, thank you. What's wrong? Are you sick? Can you hear me? I'm talking to you! Answer me! Go to hell! Get dressed! Come on! This confirms that they were headed to the border. They should have reached Buffalo by now... so all we can do is warn our friends over there. Of course, they're all good men. It won't take them long to find them. I'm sure of it. OK, boss, we'll go too. We'll leave immediately and will find those bastards! Don't worry, I'll take care of it. He could have fucked me if he wanted to. They're not as bad as they appear. Good and bad people. If it were me in your place I wouldn't have created so many problems. Also, I wonder what a story that black guy has! The important thing is to save yourself, don't you think? Don't you care about Frank? Why? Do you think Frank is going to marry me? - He's looking for the same thing as all men. - How's it going? The worst part is over. Hopefully! By the way, thanks for this stuff. - I'm sure you're used to better. - They're pigs! Especially this one. We must be careful. - Double six! - You did it once more! Say, are you quick with your hands, if you know what I mean? I didn't ask you to play. Between you and the other one I've really had it! Hey, take it easy! I want to play again, but let's play for more, it will be more fun. If you want to... - Five cents a game. - Wow! A whole lot of money! I realize that you students don't have much but five cents... - Why? Do you have a lot of money? - Money earned with hard labor. You see, Frank, you study while your father takes care of earning the money. On the other hand, my father drinks up all his money instead of bringing it home. - Ricko, can I go to sleep? - What? I'd like to go to sleep. Sure, OK... Darn it! Just when he was about to catch him! You're at it again! Aren't you afraid of Archie? You want it just as me. You want it so much I can see it in your face. Don't expect me to make the first move. I want to see you beg. I want you to rub against me like a dog in heat. Bastard! Dirty bastard! Pig! Go on! You might get what you want if you keep provoking me. Maybe I'll do you on the bed so I'll do my good deed of the day. Asshole! Maybe I'll hire you and take you to Las Vegas. What do you say? - Stop bullshitting! Are we playing or not? - OK... Damn it! - Damn it! - I win. Stay still! Don't move! No please, you're hurting me! You're hurting me! Leave her alone! I'm here for you. Look at me. Do you like me like this? There's no need to force yourself with that thing if you want a woman. Come on! Come here! I won't eat you. Come on! Come closer! Don't be scared. Come on! Let me see that you're a man. Hey! What's wrong? Are you going to tell me I'm not your type? Of course not! You like me, don't you? Yes, I can see you're starting to like me. You've got a big one. A very big one! - Is it true? - Of course! I'd even like to try it out! Come on! Let me see what you've got. A knife. Don't you have anything better I can feel? Are you embarrassed? Don't tell me it's your first time. Right? By the way, what's your name? Bob. Come on, Bob, I can't do everything by myself. Do you think I'm a whore? Yes, you're starting to act reasonably. See, you have a willy! And it's very big! Come on, Bob, give it to me. Like this! You're strong! You're strong. You're really good! Ah, Bob... One must be careful with you! How many did you kill this way? - Stop it! You're the one who killed me! - It's your fault! You're not ugly enough. Ricko, why don't you stay with me? Because you're not old enough to support a man. You're such an asshole. I just meant for a while. At least until we feel like it. - I feel like it now. - More? Do you know what I'd do to you if I had some champagne? I'd spill it on you and lick it off your body. I think I saw some in the fridge. - Too far away! I'll take this. - What? Watch out! You spilled it all over yourself. Where? - Here. - Right! It would be a pity to waste it. Don't stop... Yes! Whiskey is not your game, my friend! He's totally drunk! What are you doing? Admiring the show? I'll go to the patio, it's too hot here. Are you coming? What's wrong? I get it! You're afraid of me, but I'm a good black man. Cigarette? What shall we talk about? Calm down. You can choose the subject. Shall we talk about sex? Or should we talk about money? There's a whole lot in there. Sure, as long as I have time to enjoy it. You could help me spend it. What do think? Have you lost your tongue? - Why do you tell me these things? - Because... Because you should know certain things, girl. First of all that life is short and second that there's some men who are looking for us. And if they find us you can say good-bye to Sammy and his friends. Do you understand the concept? Do you ever say anything? - Why did you bring me here? - Because I like you, why else? If you have to do it then do it now. Don't get mad. Actually, I would like to do it with you. You're my type. Say, is that little thing in between your legs still intact? Sit down. You know what? I must be a little nuts. I don't know how to explain it to you but... one day you might regret having done it with a black guy... and just because you were too scared to say no. I'm not afraid of you anymore... or, rather, I am... I'm afraid you'll hurt me. You're pretty good! You know what we'll do? I have an idea. I'm sure you'll like it. We'll do one of those little tricks you girls do to stay virgins. Don't tell me you've never done it? I'm sure you know it! Trust me. I'm good at these things. And that little thing will be left just like mommy made it... to be broken only after the wedding. What do you say? You should have brought a boyfriend too. I don't care about being humped like an animal. I do. - Do you like women? - It would only disgust me. I tried it and it's not bad at all. I don't keep it tight to... to be difficult. It's that I don't want... I don't give a shit about a collection of fucks. The day that I'll open my legs I'll have to know why I do it and with whom. - No, please! - Is he your boyfriend? - Let him beg me. - Please! - Louder, I can't hear you. - I beg you! You're a good girl. I could tell right away. I swear! We could become friends me and you. Intimate friends. - She's a virgin. - What? I said she's a virgin. You must be kidding. Do you think it's normal at your age? You'll end up getting sick. Leave her alone! I'm here for you. Look at me. Do you like me like this? Come on! Come closer. Don't be scared. Let me see that you're a man. Like this... Going crazy, huh? Get up! Stand up and don't say a word! - It was nice, Sam. - Not bad, girl. - I've been selfish. - Stop it. No, all I did was enjoy myself while you... That's what you think. But if you insist, you can also give me pleasure like this. Sam. - What? - I'm worthless, aren't I? It's just a question of practice. Like playing the piano. Come on, move, you bastards! These two were upstairs. It doesn't add up. There must be another bastard around. - Find him! - OK, I'm going. - Did you like it? - You're on the right track. Be quiet and don't move! - They have nothing to do with this. - This is not for you to say! Yes, you're right but, you see, we have a lot of money. It's more than five-thousand. - We'll drop them and we'll stay friends. OK? - No way! No, five-thousand dollars is a lot only for a bastard like you. - Do something. Ricko! Try to do something! - Enough! Shut up! I don't want to hear a single word! Hey, Ricko, kiss her good-bye. I'm sorry but not even Canada is far enough at this point. Ricko! Fine, whenever I'll need some rubber toys I'll know where to find you. Let's go! Sammy! Sammy! - Sammy! - Christ, I forgot! You don't know how much I owe you, kid. You don't know how much I owe you, nigger. Hello? Mr. Moran, please, tell him it's Lorna. Archie? What kind of people did you send me? Professionals? What? - Let's go. - They're in a million pieces! - What? You want to leave her like this? - Do what you want. Yes, I'm fine. No, they didn't touch me. Come pick me up. I'm a nervous wreck! Hurry up! Hey, what's the hurry? We'll find someone who'll take us to the station. What? To the station? Are you nuts? To go where? Anywhere! What's important is that it's at least five-thousand dollars away!
