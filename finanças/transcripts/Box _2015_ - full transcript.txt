I remember when they took Father away, the music was playing… At the cemetery, the guns were shooting… He was a general. What's the point of thinking about all this? CAR WASH - FOR SALE Go! Forward! Back! Forward! Back! Go! Go! Go! One - two - three… Why are your steps so big? Just one step forwards and one backwards! Forwards, backwards! One next to the other. Don't take such big steps. One - two - three! One - two - three! Pull away! One - two - three! Together and apart! Together, turn. Apart. Look into your partner's eyes! Turn, apart! Try to keep the rhythm! Turn, apart!

Good bye! Hello! Bye! SIBIU - MARTYR CITY Shouldn't you be at the car-wash? Yeah, I'll leave soon. Take it, Foxy! Take it, girl! What's up, Max? Go! -What's up, boss? -Hi. -How are things, boss? -Good. You? I heard you were asking after me. Listen, Rafael. I'll be honest with you. I spoke to your trainer… and we agreed. In fact, I decided. You should come over to me, and train here. That gym is no place for you. This is where you should be, next to me. I'll give you three hundred euros, each month, cash-in-hand, One thousand euros each fight, two thousand euros for a win. If you're worth it, there'll be even more coming your way, trust me.

Ay, truly… For the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox. But now the time gives it proof. I did love you once. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so. You should not have believed me. For virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not. I was the more deceived… Thou should not be a breeder of sinners! I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, Imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in! Good evening! Good evening! Sorry! Yes? -Congratulations! -Sorry. Thank you. Congratulations! You were wonderful, tremendous! What are you doing? I'm looking for a telephone number. Why on Daddy's phone? Because I don't have that number. I'll get you dizzy! Put your hands down! Look how good you are! Go! By the TV… The time will come and we will understand it all… Why there is all this suffering? When we will eventually understand, the pain will stop. We have to work! To work… It is autumn now. Soon it will be winter, and the snow will cover everything. And I will work, I will work… How the military music sounds… They are leaving us. One of them is already gone forever, forever and for good. But we shall remain here. And we shall start over again. We have to live! -Okay! Stop! -We have to live! Why do you say here "We have to live, we have to live"? What is your character doing here? You don't know, that's why you're not acting well. What are you doing there? We're preparing for the show. Do it after the rehearsal, we're not done here. A longer cross… once more! Come on… Make the cross wider, hook me with it… Nice and wide, good.

We will get help from two smart Romanians… I'll get two glasses. You will meet George… Geography, history, math, even arts, are more attractive now. Music classes are held in a classroom that resemble with a concert room. At foreign language classes, the students… We will witness the premiere of the movie 300: Rise of an Empire. From now on, I'll only be boxing against big names. …he'll crawl to the entrance of the hall where he will… I want to say that… Where? At a new gym, with a manager… you don't know him. Who'll train you? Their trainer. They'll give me one thousand euros per month and three thousand euros every fight. Bravo! My first love was football. I was going to all the football matches. The first Steaua game I saw wasa Steaua-Craiova. Craiova scored first. I was six-seven years old. I was one of the few games where I was at a stand. Most of the time, I watch… I'm going out. At this hour? You're not going to bed? I'm going out with some friends. I'll sleep later. The third one hard! There! Hard! Head up! Don't bend down! Stand straight! After three hits, change the place… Avoid your opponent! That's it! That's it, go! A burst to the head with the left! A wider left, to the side of the bag, hitting over his hands, in the neck, that's your target. Faster with the left! That's it! Don't step back. Right here, that's it, come on! The third in the stomach! More power in the left… Not like that. Harder with the final left. After you've finished, he'll want to hit you. So that's when you counter-attack. Once more. Go! Bravo! Too late! In the palm, here. Left. With a stronger left. More aggressive! Harder! Left, right, go… Bravo! Move! Left. Left. Go! Bravo! -Come on, Shorty! -Come on, that's it!

I don't get it! -Madalina will join us. -This is ProFM. We will enjoy this night with your songs… What are you doing Cristina? I thought there was someone at the door. We shall be forgotten. They will forget our voices. They will forget our faces. They will even forget how many sisters we were. What are you doing? Let me go! But our suffering… But our suffering will turn to happiness. Our suffering will turn to happiness, peace will find reign on earth, and the memory of those who lived here in these times will be blessed. My sisters! My sweet little sisters! No! No! Our lives have not yet reached the end, do you understand? We will live! Are you not hearing this music? Can you not hear how joyful it is, how sprightly it sounds? What are you doing? Nothing… I feel that we will soon find out the meaning of our lives, and the reason… of this suffering… Only if we would know why… Only if we would know why… It's not right. What are you doing? Why did you cover my mouth? What are you doing, Cristina? What is this character like? -She is a married woman, 25 - 30… -I know that. …and she has an affair. But what's happening in this scene? -How do you see Olga? -She can see that Olga is fake. Yes. And? I feel that she loves her. You felt it wrong 'cause your mind was elsewhere. She loves her! You were not paying attention to the scene here. She loves her. You were not paying attention. She doesn't love her, we already agreed on this. Didn't we? What did we say? That… my character used to be like her a while ago. Okay. How about feeling this instead? Talk to me! Okay. Let's do it… What did you say? I didn't hear you. Let's do it! Okay… Take it from the top! Come on, Maria. Wait a minute! What do you want? Do you want me to go to the police? Why go to the police? I want to ask you out for a coffee. Are you crazy? Am I crazy if I ask you out? Are you? Listen… If you go out with me once, I promise I won't follow you anymore and… you won't see me ever again. What do you say? Sorry if I scared you. You didn't scare me. Are you at school? Not anymore. I'm a boxer now. You're Hungarian, right? Can't you tell by my accent? That's why I asked. There were lots of Hungarians at school. Really? You're very young. How old do you think I am? 21. I'm 19. Listen… Look at me! If you weren't married… and didn't have a child… would you have married me? How could I marry you? Just like that. You'd marry me. Who knows? Maybe… Hey! I invited you out. Please. I'll pay. Bye! -Are you scared? -No. Shorty? Come here! Don't break him. Don't worry, I won't kill him. Listen! Easy. Come on, Rafa, finish him! Give it to him! Jab! -Go, Shorty! -Go! Go, Shorty! Stop! Breathe! Come here! I told you, give him a cross from far back! Look at me! From far back. Got it? Surprise him when he comes. You know he's stronger. Box. Go! Hit him, Rafael! -Leonard. -Rafael. -Pleased to meet you. -Me too. You do boxing or kick-boxing? Boxing. -Have you met? -Yes. -Have you heard of him? -No. Do you know who he is? Leonard is European champion in the 69 kg category. He has been with me for two years. Soon he'll turn professional. But before that… He's going to box on Saturday, in one of my matches. I've a surprise for the two of you. You're going to face each other. Important names from the sport are going to come. Businessmen, people with money. It won't be public, it'll be done properly. Don't worry, that's for me to worry about. It'll be nice and proper. Will you open it? Hey! How much longer is it going to take? Three quarters of an hour. Too much. I can see you're in no hurry. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I said, you seem to have plenty of time. What do you mean? You're lazy. Come on! -What? -Come on, I'm in a rush! -Are you in a rush? -Yes. What are you doing? Why are you soaping it again? Hey! What are you doing? Have you gone crazy? Are you deaf? Where are you going? Get out of here, or I'll knock your head off. What? Hey! And then, how will you get back? By car, right after the match. How long will it take? About three hours. When you get back, cut down the walnut tree. The walnut tree? Yes. Why would I cut it down? Just like that. You go to the neighbour, take the chainsaw, cut the branches, then cut it down. Come with a tractor and a rope, tie it up, and take it away! But why cut it? Just like that. Didn't you say when we moved here, that the house is yours, but the walnut is mine? You just cut it down! I don't understand… Just like that. Don't you like it? I do. I'm going to a workshop in Cluj tomorrow. What kind of workshop? Dance theatre. With a dancer from England. If you want the basic moves, I can show you. Show me! When do you leave? Tomorrow evening. No, thanks. Take care of yourself! I'll keep my fingers crossed. You take it easy. -Hello! -Hello! Get in the back. -Hello, boss. -Hey. -Good evening! -Hello, Bebe! What's up? -Are you nervous? -No, boss. Are you sure? You should be nervous… -Bebe, will you give us a minute alone? -Of course. So, Rafael, are we going to win? For sure, boss! Sure, someone has to win, right? Yes, boss. Who do you think will win? -I've heard he's good… -But you're good as well. Otherwise you wouldn't be here. -But who do you think will win? -Me, boss. What was our agreement? I'd give you one thousand euros for a match and two thousand for a win. -Right? -Yes, boss. I don't know if you've heard, but I'm an honest man. -Yes, boss. -I'll give you three thousand euros… but you have to lose this match. I want you to hit the floor in the second round. Why, boss? Because I say so. Because that is what I'm asking. It is me who decides who wins, who loses, everybody does what I say! Leonard has to win! -I want to keep hold of my career. -You what? -I want to keep hold of my career. -I'm the one who makes your career! I tell you when to win and when to lose. You think I'm some kind of fool? Do I look like a fool? You think I'm some retired cut-man? What the fuck do you take me for? Stand up when I'm talking to you. Stand up when I'm talking to you! You think I'm like old Bebe here? Put your hands behind your back! Hands behind your back when I'm talking to you! Or I'll take it the wrong way! Didn't you understand from the start? Do you think I make my money sat behind a desk? I risked everything… I'll fucking destroy you! I'm not explaining myself to you! I'm not your cut-man… I'll destroy you, I swear! Watch out! Bebe! Don't play games with me. I swear on my life I'll bring you to your fucking knees! Bebe, carry on, please. Sit down. Let's do the other hand, we're late. Rafael! Rafael! Rafael! Good evening! I'm looking for Rafael. He's not home, he has a match. What do you want with him? I just wanted… When will he be back? At 11 or 12 at night. Excuse me… Could I come in and wait until he arrives? Not until he arrives. I understand. I'll wait here, then. What is he doing, Coach? I'll sort it out in the break. I'll speak to him, and… We'll sort it. Your whole career is at stake here! You go down in this round, and stay down. Is that clear? You stay down! You hear? Don't spit! Drink it! You hear? You stay down. Stop! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Stop! What happened to you? I lost. What happened with your hand? It's twisted. Do you need help? No, I'll manage. -I knew she likes soup. -Do you like it? Me? Yes. -Don't say you don't like it! -I like it! Eat up! -You want vinegar in the salad? -Yes, please.
