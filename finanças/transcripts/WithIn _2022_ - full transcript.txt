Lucy? Hi, how are you? Hi, Dr. Gordon. Uh... this is so weird. You're there, I'm here. How do we do this? How do we start? Just like we always do when you were in my office, except you hit the camera on the bottom left of your screen. Do you... do you have to see me? Well, since we haven't talked in a while, I think it's important that, uh, I have some visual contact with you. We can go to normal phone sessions in the future. Patients have been worried about their hair looking different. No, it's not that. I look great. I'm so rested. Glad you're sleeping. - Thank you! - So... let's turn the camera on. Fortunately, it has also given me some anxiety, like with this call. Like, what if your house is... ugly. That would be very triggering for me. - You've seen my office. - I have, and I have been wanting to talk to you about that. I feel like the color of the walls and the couch are fighting each other. Why don't we, uh... Why don't we... take a breath? Close your eyes, picture an endless body of water. Put your mouse on the video prompt, and click when you're ready. How are you? Uh... No. How are you? With COVID? I'm fine. No, with being Black. Er... Sorry, with, um... With being African-American. With the Black Lives Matter. Well, it's a... It's painful time. - Yeah. - But it's always been painful. I mean, these murders aren't new. But the public concern is. Our pain is becoming a shared pain. There's a sense of relief, you know, in that, and, um... a sense of hope that maybe there'll be some real and lasting change. I take responsibility, and I am so sorry that racism even exists. - Can I say that? - Yes, of course. It's disgusting, and I feel guilty. I... I actually do. I really do. And, um... What was... What can I do? Well, you could commit to learning about the true history of racism. - That's a start. - I did. Yeah, I've done that. I've, um... I've been reading James Baldwin, and I've watched that, um... the documentary on... Er, what... Frederick Douglass. So good. - That's a great beginning. - Yeah. - Frederick Douglass is... - Should we start now? Sure. Yes. Yes, of course, of course. So, how are you? Well... I have found this pandemic very validating, which has been incredible for my self-esteem. Um... Yeah. Tell me about that. This is my time. Can you elaborate? I'm right. Finally. Well, I have always been right. Um... The world is full of dangerous germs, and if we get near them, we die. And... that is so liberating. There's a lot to... A lot to unpack in what you just said. So what I'm hearing is, in a way, the world is walking in your shoes now. Yes! Yes. Exactly. I mean, I've been washing my hands 30 times a day and socially distancing my entire life. Friends are calling me for advice. It sounds as if there's a feeling of relief, as well as a sense of belonging to your own life. - That's a very powerful, Lucy. - Yeah. I feel like I could start dating. Um, I've always avoided touching people, even people I want to touch, and now that is socially acceptable. So, the reality of COVID, along with your OCD, has helped you manage your response to it. Is that a dog? Have you got a dog? - Um... - I don't like dogs. I... - Dr. Gordon, have you got a dog? - No. Uh... They lick your butt and lick your face. - No, no, no, no... I... No... - And they have worms. And Parvo. - I don't have any pets, but... - And they get ear infections. For the record, humans can't catch any diseases from a dog. Can't you get COVID from a dog? There have been no confirmed cases of pets carrying COVID, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Right. No confirmed cases. What about the cases that haven't been confirmed? It's on their website. This is my worst fear, experts giving me advice that I can't trust. Hmm... Let's talk about that. Tell me about that. The only voice I can trust is the one inside me, and... for the first time, ever... it's not broken. Let's stay with that for a moment. This feeling, that the world has... finally caught up to who you are, and it's helping you find your place. Yeah. - Please, can you make it stop? - I, uh... I'm gonna lose my voice! Can you please make it stop? I can't... make it stop. But what if we, um, do some deep breathing together? We... we think of the barking as a calming sound. All right? Let's... let's just change our emotional frame of reference to it. Okay? And breathe in, one. In. And out. Yes. Good job, Lucy. Good job. "Dear Chinese chicken salad, dressing on the side, "chicken on the side, lettuce on the side... "I've delivered food to your house several times. "I notice you have an enclosed yard "and always add a tip on the app, "even when I was late or messed up your order. "Thank you for that." Oh! "I can no longer afford to stay in L.A. "under these circumstances, "so I'm going back to where I came from "to live in an apartment with my parents." Aw... "But it doesn't allow pets, "so I'm taking a leap of faith, "putting my trust in the right person who will do "the right thing for my... Nala. "She's a sweet girl, soulful, and so smart. "Please be the person I believe you to be." "Please be the person I need you to be..." Me? Oh, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ooh. This is... This is not... No. Why? Why, why, why, why me? Why me? This is really pushing all my buttons. This is... too much. I am in control of my thoughts. I am in control of my emotions. I am in control of my thoughts. I am in control of my emotions. I am in control of my thoughts. St... Wait, wait, wait. Stay right there. Stay right there. Hi... Nala. I'm Beth. Do you bite? 'Cause that would be a deal breaker. He said you were sweet. I've always wanted a dog, but... I've never allowed myself to have one. Although everyone I've ever known has highly recommended my making this kind of commitment. I have work. I have patients that really need me right now. Could you please keep it down for a moment? That's my next patient, and he can be kind of demanding. We don't know when it's gonna go back. My job is to help you feel safe with the uncertainty of that. No, it's... it's my neighbor's dog. Nala? Shh. Of course. Of course you have my... my full attention. Yes, Donald. Yeah. You... you're going into... you're going into panic. Let's... get you back in focus, okay? I want... Let's use your senses. Okay. All right. Tell me one thing you can touch. Your phone. Right, okay. Yes. And one thing you can smell. Oh, okay. And one thing you can taste. Do you have a... do you have some water there? Okay. Take a sip. Good, Donald. All right. Okay. Now breathe in. Hi, Nala. That was... one. That was two. That was three. This is... I can't do this. I can't. Yeah... I understand. Karen, yes. FaceTime her 15 to 20 times in a row, short calls. The more you're exposed to the fact that she's healthy and wants to engage will help open new neural pathways for the both of you. I don't have room for this in my life. Yes, I live alone. I work from... I work from home, but I can't split my focus. I don't have time. Hawthorne Shelters reopened. Wait, it says here Hawthorne is a high-kill shelter. How many pounds is she? Um... Well, she's not gonna fit in a purse, if that's what you mean. She resembles a, uh... a Pitbull with short legs. Big dogs get put down first? Why? That's just wrong. What if I donate money for her to stay until she's adopted? Who is "they"? It's ultimately up to me. Why does everyone think I have the answer? Why is it always up to me to figure out what's right? Hello? Hi, Nala. Can you sit? Not bad. Can you fetch? Good job! Right here! Oh, good job! It's not your germs that worry me, because people with animals tend to have stronger immune systems for a host of reasons. Happiness quotient, exercise level. Being exposed to more germs helps the body more easily fight them off. I know what it's like to be pre-judged for what you look like, to provoke a response when you're doing nothing, because people live in fear. They have these prejudices they don't even understand. The hardest part for my clients with OCD is... once they've mastered the fear of one thing, their fear often transfers to something else. I feel their pain, 'cause it ties into my own OCD and panic issues. But of course I can't tell them that. I can't tell them anything that personal. You know? So COVID has been easy for me. It's been a relief not to go out. My whole life has been about keeping a... a safe distance from people, because... I've been easily misunderstood, you know? Because, to be really honest, Nala... I'm afraid if they knew all of me... they might not love me. I think we're making progress. The fuck is she FaceTiming me for? Shit. Fuckin' cheeky. Okay. All right. - Hey! - Hey. - You did your hair? - Mm-hmm. Why? Where the fuck you going? Oh, shut up. And why the hell are you wearing a hat in the house? I was on a call, I told you. Anyway, what's up? I'm trying to find the strength not to kill my husband, but it's... You go. What's up with you? How are you? I'm all right. You know, just trying to stay busy. Been writing, exercising. Have you been exercising? Really? Gigi, come on! I'm sorry. I... I know you don't exercise, so I thought I would ask. You know, maybe you're trying to take advantage of the situation and be healthy. Oh, shut up. - You shut up. - Oh, look at this shit. The numbers just went up again. I know, I saw the news this morning. It's horrible. God, I'm telling you, this shit is scaring the shit out of me. The end is coming, and my husband, he's over there watching that stupid news channel, and he's still convinced that it's a hoax. And every day he's in my ear talking shit... - Well, it's not a hoax. - I know that. Okay? Please don't stress me out. Please. Coco, I'm telling you right now, God's wrath is coming down upon us. Okay? Just like the Bible says, there will be fires, - there will be floods... - And world destruction, and the world's going to end. Gigi, they've been preaching the same shit during every world crisis since the Spanish Flu to Y2K, and now this. You wanna let me finish a sentence, maybe? Because that's... You're really annoying. I'm not trying... Okay, you know what? I'm sorry. I've been cooped up in this house alone for a week and a half with no one to talk to, so... - cut me some slack. - Well, I thought you said you were just on the phone with someone. - Well, you know what I mean. - Well, I called you. You know that? I called you yesterday, I called day before yesterday, and you didn't call back. Please don't tell me it's because you were busy, - 'cause I know your ass wasn't. - I was. Yeah, what? Doing what? Coloring in those grays? I just did mine this morning. Uh, did you get Botox? No. Oh, wow! Wow. You... Who the hell's looking at your big-ass forehead right now? - Gigi! - For your husband, who's not even there, and me and maybe a couple other girls? You know, the world is coming to an end and you're worried - about your forehead? - Yep. - Perfect. - And you need to get yourself some botox too whenever this shit is over. And you need to take care of that mustache that's growing, it's hideous! Uh... you know it's 11 o'clock in the morning? And? I bet you a lot of other people are pouring right now too. This shit is too crazy not to get drunk before noon. You really need to start praying. I pray every day... as I thank the Lord for these fermented grapes. Oh, Coco. Oh, Gigi, relax. Jesus drank wine too during a time of crisis, so it's okay. - What? - The Last Supper? How the hell do you think he got up on that cross? Coco! Blasphemy! That's at least a week in hell! And he should've smoked a fatty, too. Speaking of... Mm-mm-mm. Look at that. Yep! - Seriously, Coco? - It's just weed. - God's own green grass. - At least a month in hell. A month. Oh, shit. Fuck. I didn't even get... He's back now, and I didn't even get to tell you why I called you. Girl, all of a sudden, he wants to start fucking again. No joda. You poor thing. I know! But you know what? At least it only lasts five or ten minutes tops. ! Cállate! Cállate.Don't say anything. You're so lucky that you still like having sex with John. I mean, it's... I know it's hard not having him there with you, but girl, at least he's not driving you crazy like every other woman's husband is doing right now. I'm... Okay, gotta go. All right, he's here. I gotta go. - I'll talk to you later. Bye. - Okay. Bye. Shit. Oh, my God. You look like a hot mess - and I'm a fat fuckin' pig. - Coco, I really... I didn't... I... Shut the fuck up. I... I didn't call for this. What's wrong? Oh, God. I just... I started drinking again. Why? Because, I... That's... All we do is fight. That's all that happens, is... All we do is fight. - So what else is new? - You know, I can... I'm having a fucking nervous breakdown right now and I could do without your... your sarcasm. I'm sorry. I'm drunk. You okay? No, I hit him. Who, Julio? No joda. I told him, I couldn't take it anymore, and if he continued to watch that Tucker Carlson and if he didn't change the channel, I was gonna beat the shit out of him, and he laughed, so I hit him. And, you know, there was blood everywhere, and... I mean, thank God that the swelling went down. - Oh my God! - Oh my God, I know this is cra... You know what? I'm gonna call you tomorrow, because I can't even take it today. Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gigi. I'm drunk too. I'm sorry. Don't hang up. So what you get drunk on, Henny? No, you ass! It wasn't Henny, it was gin. - And I'm going to hell. - No, you're not. Because there is no hell. Okay? You die and that's it. Jail? Maybe. Especially with your temper. You know what? You really shouldn't be drinking... I... Actually, I... I don't want to hear you go into a tizzy about this, about me drinking, please. All right? I had to drink, 'cause if not, I'm gonna kill this guy. I'm gonna kill this man. I love him. I love my husband, but I do not like him. And I don't like him right now. And you are lucky that you love and you like John. Okay, right. Right? Yes. Yes, I... I love and like John. It's just, this distance is getting to me. You know, I called him this morning, and he said... It doesn't even matter. He doesn't even seem bothered, and I'm, like, - fuckin' losing it. - Trust me, trust me. John is going through it too. Don't worry. This is gonna pass eventually. I thought you said the world is ending. Yeah, I said a lot of things. Question is, do I really believe it? Maybe it's the gin talking, I don't know. Either way, I'm tired and I'm gonna pass out. Um, I'm gonna go to sleep. Okay? Bye. No, no, no, wait... - Hey! - Hey... Uh, Julio's downstairs in the living room and he doesn't know about my little friend here. Oh my God, it's getting bad. You know what? I got my little friend right here, too. Oh my goodness! ¿Ya eso? You saw the news today? Yeah. John called. Yeah, gin. He said he thinks he should, uh... stay away for another week. So. Hmm. You know that I've always been jealous of the love that you and John have for each other? Why? Because... because I was and am, stupid! You remember the time that we were all sitting around your house in Connecticut, and we were going around and everybody had to say what they would miss if they never had it again? And your John said, "I can't imagine my life without this woman. "The thought of losing her scares the shit out of me "because I love her so much." And then I said you guys were pathetic cornballs, remember? I know I remember 'cause Julio followed that up with he misses playing Call of Duty. Oh, no, honey, that was supposed to make you laugh, not cry. No, I'm sorry. It's just... I keep getting these panic attacks, you know? Like, I'm here all by myself. Like, what if I die by myself? You know? And, like... You know, and then it's like, what if you're right? What if this is the end? Have another drink with me. You know, have another... Light one of your joints. Oh, God. The hell is happening to you? I don't know. It's all right. You know, I really should stop. I mean, not the weed, but, you know. It's the liq... This is truly the devil's water. You know? It really is. But, you know, it's just... You know, I was thinking this morning, if... Maybe if I believed in God like you, maybe I would have some hope, and I wouldn't be so fucked up - and wouldn't worry, just... - Believing... doesn't miraculously wipe away all your shortcomings. Trust me on that one. And you know that you do this? You did this every time Daddy went away for work, 'cause you were daddy's little girl. Yeah, well, at least you were his best friend. I was always so jealous of that, that you two had that. You were jealous of me... and I was jealous of you. Stupid! He's gonna be home in a week, all right? Everything's gonna be okay. Don't worry. Woo! - Havin' a hot flash over here. - Ahh! Ahh! What? Put it back on! Shut up! You shut up, because I bet you if you take that hat off, you're gonna look just like this. - No, I ain't taking off shit. - Come on, take it... why not? It's just me. Take it off. Okay, fuck it. Ugh, yeah. You look like dried-up chia pet. Well, at least I don't have a hideous mustache growing! That's... That's so messed up. Gigi... Do you really think this could be the end? Honestly, I don't know. You really don't believe in God? Honestly, I don't know. Do you? Honestly, I don't know. ! No joda! ! No joda, tu! And listen, I'm gonna do a drive-by for some weed tomorrow. - Gigi! - Desperate times call for desperate measures. I don't want to hear it. Are you okay? I'll be okay. You okay? Yeah. I love you. I love you more. And please fix that hideous mustache. - Byeee! - Bye. I swear to God, my entire Instagram feed is sourdough porn. Bread. Hot. Yeah, I bet it tastes awful, though. I mean, think about it. All these stay-at-home bakers. I mean... I mean, imagine. I mean, they don't know what they're doing. They're just bored and trying to bake. I actually read that there's a whole art and science to sourdough baking. - How hard can it be? - I don't want to point fingers, but you burnt the pasta last night. So... I'm just saying, but you did. Sam called. Right. Well, I, for one, would be very up for some fresh-baked sourdough. - Really? - Mm-hmm. No, you know, the thing is, when this is over... If this ever is over... I don't think that I want to be one of those... pandemic sourdough people. Sorry. Whatever. He's got his new chainsaw. I'll get us some sourdough starter. It can be my contribution to this whole... Little House on the Prairie cosplay. Sure. Does that... painting look straight to you? Doesn't look straight to me. I like it better here. Hmm? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, it's good for now. I don't know if just for now. It's nice. We have fresh air, we have space. I achieved some kind of minimal competence with the chainsaw. We'll have all the firewood we ever need. Right. But what if we... I don't know. Do you think we'd change if we never went back to the city, like... - Then we'd be country people. - Mm-hmm. You'd spend all your time splitting wood, and I'd... I'd... - Darn socks, and knit. - Right. And can things. Right. 'Cause, secretly, you'd like that. - I... - Little lady looking after the house while you're busy doing manly things. I do like the idea of being... more self-sufficient. - Yeah. - Less wasteful. Yeah, of course. Quite worried about Dory, though. Got to be strange, being stuck up here in her friend's house for God knows how long, and... boyfriend's miles away, and... I don't know, she's not exactly bucolic. No. Well, I don't know. People change. These are the folks, they're saying that, "Hey-o, summertime, civilization returns! "Testing, testing will save us." Loyal listeners, you heard it here first. This here, right now, is hunker-down time. I mean, it's not like I'm saying things are gonna be back to normal by then. I'm just saying there's gonna be some new normal, and that is going to be more like real life than, like... - you know, like this. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, what are people gonna do, just be like, "Hmm, well, civilization, that was nice"? Oh, shit, that's Sam. Hey! Oh, God, I can't believe it's four o'clock already. I've literally done nothing today. Did you order sourdough starter? - Hmm? - Black death? Mm-mm. Must have been Dory. Does she seem straight to you? She never seems straight to me. - I hate that painting. - Oh. The YouTube woman said you had to wait until it was super buoyant before baking. All right, so let's just clear up some misconceptions, shall we? Prepping's not about 100 cans of beans in your bunker. It's about being prepared for the day when GrubHub's not delivering. Ready for that day, because you're who's gonna be laughing then, huh? Bingo. You are alone. Yeah, look around. That's it, pal. There's idiots out there infecting each other so they can drink their cosmotinis. I hope they're happy. Are you? You're baking? Mmm-hm. Tonight, there will be bread. I mean, are we done flying on planes? Forever? Explain to me how there can even be an airline industry anymore. There's gonna be five people per plane? Explain the economics of that. Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sure you're gonna be able to fly to London and see Sam again. At some point. I'm so glad you like the tajin. I got the recipe off the N ew York Times cooking app. You should have some more bread. I'm okay. I can be the mother tonight. You know, for somebody who ordered their sourdough starter as a joke, you've gotten pretty into baking. I didn't order the starter. Stop. Don't do that. I'll do the dishes. No, it's fine. You guys cooked. Just relax. You chopped a lot of wood today. Ah. Uh... It's all right. Just... go watch something stupid on television. Sourdough pancakes look good. There's a recipe for sourdough pizza! - What have you done? - Jesus. Feed... me. Oh, so, Europe's opening up. That's a good sign, huh? Yeah, yeah? You think you're going back to work? You're gonna get on the subway with your fancy COVID passport, huh? Fat chance, fucker. This isn't the end of anything.

As we head into summer the big question is... Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, just need to get the gingerbread... Jenny, come up to the front. You should have been on break 15 minutes ago. I'll take it from here, thank you. You're gonna get me in trouble. They'll get over themselves. - How are the boys? - They're okay. They've been with Jeffrey's mom in St. Louis this whole time, which is good, but I miss them. - How are you guys? - We're good. Giving it over to God. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you so much, I appreciate it. - Stay safe, TJ. - You too. All righty, bye. Next in line, step down, please. Hi, Millie! Hi, Millie! I missed you too. Come on. Go outside. Okay, let's go outside. Good girl. Good girl! Come on, come on. Come to mama. Good girl. Okay. Two arms, no head. Two arms, no head. Two arms, no head. Two arms... Hello? - Surprise. - Tarumi? I've been trying to call you, but you never answer your phone. Why didn't you leave a message? Oh, my God, I had to get out of the city and I know that you guys have the pool house. Can you believe there's fucking traffic during a pandemic? Yeah. - Are you looking at my hair? - No. - Please don't. - No, it looks good. Because I had to dye it with Just For Men - and it's all they had. - Oh, you look really good. - You do. - You are really, - still an incredibly bad liar. - I'm not lying. Oh, I am just, oh, I'm so happy to see you. I mean, I would be happy to see anyone, even you, Millie, and I hate dogs. Oh, where are the two Js? They went to St. Louis to visit Jeffrey's mother, and they kind of got stuck there. Well, perfect. Then I can stay in Julius' room and I don't have to sleep in that crappy bed. All right. She's taking a nap. A nap? Or is she passed out? She took a Benadryl because she said she was having an allergic reaction to something that I put in the eggs. Oh, she was... she was having a really hard time in the city. Jen, when is your sister not having a really hard time? I think it's better when she has a boyfriend. What happened to Eric? Well, um, they broke up because he decided he wasn't going to get divorced. I didn't know he was married. Yeah. Thought I told you. No. She's my sister. What was I supposed to say? How about "No"? It's... you know, it's just gonna be a couple of days and she'll be gone by the time you get home. Mmm. I'm... I'm not exactly sure when that's gonna be. Why? People are, people are traveling. You could drive. Cynthia and Bill just drove to see her parents in Cleveland. I want to see you. No, I just think I need to stay here with mom and Julius right now. Look, keep your distance from her, okay? And no hugging. I don't really trust her version of quarantine. Oh, that crane's back. I'm gonna take a picture to show you guys. Okay, babe, I'm gonna... I'm gonna hop off, all right? - I'll see you later. - Okay. What are sisters for if not to break up - with your boyfriend for you? - I can't believe it, though. I mean, I really... I can't believe that you actually managed to do it. No, but I didn't plan it, you know, you just went to the bathroom and it just... Blurted it out. - And I mean... What? - What did you say? What did you say to him again? Oh my God, I said... I said... I said, "You know, I have... I have good news." - What was his name? - His name was Tim. I'm sorry. "Okay, I have good news, Tim. You're free to date other people." Well, it's never been hard for you to be direct. - That's... that's for sure. - Yeah, got that from Dad. You know, "You look fat in that dress." Oh, you always knew where you stood with him. Actually, I'm really... I'm glad he's not around for all of this. You should see Bleecker Street, Jen... It's... it's a war zone. It's all boarded up. It's sad. I mean, I'd have protested too if I knew I'd get a free Marc Jacobs bag. - Hey, T. - Oh, I'm just kidding. Okay? I'm just very grateful that you're letting me stay here. Yeah, of course. Of course she's letting her sister stay here, right Millie? Black dogs matter. Black dogs matter. You know, I suppose... this would have been different if Dr. J and Julius were here. What would've? I don't know, just me staying here. Well, yeah, it would have been more complicated. Hmm. It always is with Dr. J. Hey, you know, he hates it when you call him that. - Don't call him that. - Come on, Jen. I mean, anybody who's been through medical school is dying for you to call them "Doctor," especially when they have completely defied the odds. "The odds"? He went to Harvard. Oh, I think everyone who knows him knows that. I don't mean anything by it. - I... - You seeing anyone? Lots of people, you know? Really good time to be dating. I watched an old movie with grandma, went on my phone, played some video games, just sat around. I went to the supermarket with Dad, took a nap. Hey honey, can you stop moving around so much? You're making me dizzy. - Oh, sorry. - It's okay. What do you... Do you guys have any plans for tomorrow? Yeah. Probably the same thing. And in the afternoon, we'll do the march. What march? Dad said he told you, but I guess he didn't. Oh, honey, I don't know. I don't know how I feel about that. Mom, come on. No, because, yeah, because I'm your mom and I want you to be safe and I'm so far away. Mom, this is my time. - It's your time? - Yeah, actually, it is. Okay. Um... All right, just, um... Just... just be... Be really, really careful, and don't get into any trouble, and don't get swept up in a mob or anything like that. Do you hear yourself right now? Remember when you told me to tell you if you say anything low-key racist? Mm-hmm. Okay, so just wear your mask the whole time and stay with your father. Don't separate from him at all. At all. Okay? And I'm... I'm really proud of you. - Okay, I will. - Love you. - Here's Dad. - Okay. Dad! Hey. Were you gonna tell me? Well, I didn't want to stress you out, Jen. Aren't you worried about your mother? Uh, so Julius didn't want to go because he was worried about her. Then this is what she left by his bed. "J, you are a spectacular gift for this mama bear "and I appreciate you worrying about me. "There are many times in our life "that just being with our friends and family is enough, "but now is not one of those times. "You are a part of this change, and this is important. "You go and be my eyes, and ears, and voice, "and then wash your hands." I'm jealous. I wish I was there with you. I miss you guys. We miss you, too. So did your sister call me "Dr. J" yet? No, she's been pretty decent. Right. What you guys been doing? Um, well, we finished that parrot puzzle. Which was really hard. Yeah, because of that piece that Millie ate. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And... and we went for a walk, um... - to the liquor store. - Ah-ha. How is it that liquor stores are essential services? - You look pretty. - You're a terrible liar. So, look, I ordered that inhaler, it should be there for you tomorrow. Thank you. I knew that marrying a doctor was a good idea. - You always were the smart one. - Yeah. You tired, baby? When's this going to be over? - You mean this call? - No. I love you. Love you too, baby. T? What's going on? You all right? Even the Ambien doesn't do it for me anymore. It's not just you. Everybody's stressed. I'm not... I'm not one of your patients. Yeah. I get it, it's a tough time in the world and all kinds of people are going through all kinds of shit. But I'm talking about me. Me, and it just basically seems that that's not allowed anymore. What's not allowed? Needs or feelings if you're white. So, yeah, I said it. So you can just fucking cancel me. I'm lonely. And I don't have anyone who loves me, so... And I defend you all the time to people. Defend me to who? I don't know. My super. Oh... People who you think are your friends, anybody. - Mom. - Mom? Yeah, Mom. Yeah, she never thought that you should have married Jeffrey. She thought that you should've married Daniel from college. That's because she knows his mother. No. That's because he was white, and she thought that your life would be harder if you married Jeffrey. So how come mine ended up being the one that was hard? Good morning. Hey, um... I wasn't at my best last night. I'm... I'm sorry about that. I know you're in trouble, T. But you can't stay with us. I don't understand why every Saturday I ask for... Wait, is that Jenny? Jenny! Jenny? I think she can't hear me. With the march today, we've now seen ten consecutive days of protests following the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. The police officers present at the time of his death have now been arraigned in court. He referenced Reverend Al Sharpton when he called for a national march in Washington. The reverend wants to use this rage and sadness felt by the public to try and get tangible police reform. That's a continued spirit felt here at the site of George Floyd's killing. A private funeral service earlier for invited guests, and of course, family and friends had hundreds of people outside in support. They spoke to the people at the memorial site and thanked them for their love. We've seen this growing before, growing, sort of, activism spring about It's only gotten bigger as the week has gone on. As I'm sure you've seen, the speedway over here has now kind of turned into almost its own village. There's a stage behind me and people are putting their fists up in protest. I guess it felt so long to think that is how long the prosecutors say the police officer's knee was on his neck. It's unbelievable. I can't believe we did that so many times in one night. It was amazing. You really are more than I bargained for. Oh, did you think I'd be a bargain? I don't normally take guys home. Not that I regret it. Well, it's not my speed either, especially to feel like this about somebody so soon. I know. It's crazy. What time is your flight again? Soon. Why do you have to fly now of all times? Because it's where I live, it's where I keep my stuff. Yeah, but why now? We don't know what's gonna happen. We might never see each other again. Don't do this, please. We had such a good time, you know, of course we're gonna see each other. You don't know that. Things are changing so fast. Right. Then, you come with me to LA. You know, I wasn't kidding when I asked you. I can't do that and next week, it might be too late. You should stay. You're being so dramatic. Just knock it off. And you're being thoughtless and glib. You know, it's a little early for you to be getting so needy, don't you think? Go to hell. Get out of my house. - Leave. - With pleasure. You were too old for me anyway. That's classy, really. Thank you for that. I see I dodged a bullet. Hey. Hey. I'm so sorry I said that. No, I'm sorry. Well, I'm glad you changed your mind. Uh, yeah, there's that and also, um, there's a travel ban so, uh, canceled my flight. You were inside the terminal? Ugh, it was a madhouse. I see you got your luggage back from the hotel. Yeah. Well, I... you know, when I went to the front desk, they said they were gonna close the place soon as I left. You should take a shower. Go... Go take a shower. You want me to take a shower? Yeah? Doesn't it sound nice? Sure. Go. I might meet you in there. Well, all right, then. What the fuck? Hey! Wait! What the fuck? It's only for 14 days. I'll use the guest bathroom. Hey, hey, you get back here. Get back here. I'm gonna call the cops. Do you have my phone? Nope. Haven't seen it. What is that? What the fuck is going on? Oh, come on. Scrambled again? Can you at least figure out how to cook an egg without burning it? Well, I don't cook and no one's delivering, so you might as well just get used to it. Oh, come on. Shut the fuck up! - What? - You know the drill. Hands up. Yeah. Beef Stroganoff. I never made it before. Did you know that Stroganoff was a Russian town? I ate that shit for breakfast. Thought you might like something to read to pass the time. You got anything from this year? You know what you're doing is illegal, right? Yeah, well, what you did should be illegal. You went back to your hotel room, you got into a filthy cab, you actually even entered an international airport, all before bringing your germs back into my home. It was an UberXL, actually. Black XUV. Ugh, you just don't get it. Mom, you have to wear your mask all the time. Well, no. Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to do. I'm not. It's just that... And what did he say? Well, tell doctor... Tell him that you need it for four weeks, Mom. I'm not yelling at you. I'm just... All I'm saying is that you should have it for four weeks. You don't know how long this thing's gonna take. That's all. Okay. And who's walking the dog right now? Woo! Woo, woo, woo! Woo! Woo! I left you a dinner. Slow poached chicken breast with bacon dust. And for dessert, a flaming strawberry flambé. Get it while it's hot. Mm. This is delicious. Glad you like it. Mm! How long does it take to slow poach a chicken? Not very long. It's only about 14 minutes. Mm, no kidding. I got it from a New York Times recipe. Thank you.

I didn't even think about it. Did you touch him? A little bit. I mean, in the places he asked me to. I think I may have overreacted too. Oh, you think so? Seriously. My mom almost died from a virus when I was a kid. She was really sick for a long time and I think it just triggered something in me. It must have been awful. Yeah. And then I had to spoon feed her Campbell's soup for four weeks before she got any better. No wonder... No wonder you're such a good cook. I think I just get scared when the people I love get sick.

Okay, I'm sorry. - Shh, shh, shh. - For goodness sake. - Please don't wake him. - Okay. Okay. Are you taking any exercise? Taking any fresh air? It'll do you good. You look absolutely exhausted. Thank you. Darling, I wish I was there with you. Yeah, well you're not. Well, you know what? Honestly, I'd rather that you were alone than with him. Mom. You know, leaving you alone at a time like this? What wa... What was... What was he thinking of? Where is he anyway? Where do you think?

No desperate desire to come and play Scrabble with the kids or something? No, honey, I'd love to play Monopoly, but I got to stop these fuckers touching my damn fence! Is he still on the...? Yep. It's your move. Um... I reckon he's gone crazy. Am I being unreasonable or should he shave? He should shave, right? Or at least have a shower. What he should do is give it a rest and come back to the land of the living. I heard that. Listen, I still don't understand why us two can't just go back to the city and see people that are actually interesting. I mean... I mean, we can't even die of it. Well, I don't think it's a good idea. And even if I was to sign off on it, good luck getting past the man upstairs. It's your turn. Hey, come on. Come on, wake up. Wake up. What? Right. So I've got a pretty crazy idea, but you got to just indulge me for a second, all right? All right. Okay, so... so we can both agree that we've got to get out of this place, right? Sure. So, why don't we just do it? Me, you, no Mom, and... And definitely no Dad. We can go to the city and we can see all our friends and... And it'll pretty much just be exactly like normal. And Mom pretty much just signed off on it anyway. Okay, but fuck off, I'm trying to sleep. We should tie him up so he doesn't wake up and screw the plan. Agreed. Hey, could you stop that? No. I know what we should do. Let's go and get some fresh air. Wait, but by fresh air, do you mean just going out in the car and staying in the car? Hey, you want to come? We're gonna go for a drive. Yeah. Or maybe we could do it tonight, like, maybe 11:00 or something when the front lawn activity goes down. Sir, I want you to step away from the fence. No, I want you to step away from the fence. You don't even have any gloves on. What is he doing? No, I want you to step away from the fence. You know our doorbell that's got that camera and everything? It's got a two-way speaker. Well, at least he came. Whatever, we're here now. Look how beautiful it is. Well... Stop. What the hell do you think you're doing? Going for a walk. No. No, no, no, no, no. No. You can get fresh air from here. You'll get a tick in there and get Lyme disease and die. Hey, don't go into the forest. You'll get a tick in there, and then you get Lyme disease and then... And then die. Okay. I made you guys some cookies. I don't care how great you're feeling, you could be asymptomatic. You could be running up and down my block, you could still be spreading it all over the place. What, is that the antibody test? It's unreliable. Fauci says the antibody test is unreliable. Cookies are great, Mom. If you stand out... If you stand outside my fence and I watch you for 14 days, then you can touch my fence. That a deal? Okay, great. How about Monopoly? That takes ages, though. Oh, we've got ages. Um, well, what else is there here? We could do a puzzle, that only takes a couple of days. No. We don't have time for a puzzle, do we? Um, okay, well, what else? There's... There's Parcheesi, there's Risk, there's Sorry. I think there's Clu... Yup, there's Clue. We could play chess? Why don't we just play Go Fish? Go Fish. Okay. Yeah. Why not? Let's play Go Fish. Hey, you wanna come and hang? Yeah. Can I hang from up here? Totally. You know, that's... Yeah, why not? You can... We can hear you from down here. It's a great idea. One good thing is that apparently, only 6% of people can get it again, which means that New York will have herd immunity, or whatever you call it really quite soon, so that's great. Mom, did you read that from The New York Times article this morning? Yeah. It was 60%, not six. Oh, oh. Well, if you think about it, that's not... No, that's... that isn't great. Good evening, we have... Do you have it? All are reporting a spike in cases. Months into quarantine, we are not out of the woods yet. And with the vaccine months away from approval...

I drive myself nuts. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hello! Come, my darlings, come. Come on! Your turkey husband sounds happy today. You're jealous of a turkey now? No, I am not. But I think Frenchy is. - Frenchy. - Yeah. You know, I think Frenchy is happier with me here. Yeah? Maybe we should try to watch something else. I'm beyond depressed looking at these death counts. Then social distancing for those lucky enough to still be alive. You wanna play that word game again? I don't know. You gonna scribble on my hand again? I don't know. I might. Okay. I'll set up the computer. You can do four-letter words. Proper names are still not allowed, no eating nuts. Oh, see, that's... that's what I wanna talk to you about. - Nuts? - Yeah, social distancing. Look, I think we like each other enough to socially distance. Well, I mean, any loud food. If I'm eating nuts or an apple, okay, or... any loud food. What if I said I'll make a pact with you to socially distance for loud food. If I eat an apple, I'll... I'll... I'll stand over here and... nuts, anything. Otherwise... Claire? Pact? One more thing to seal the deal. What? We unplug. we unplug. What I've learned is just how isolated I was before all this happened. I love the quiet. I love being with my own thoughts, keeping my own counsel, not racing around. I have so much time. It's such a relief. What was I rushing around for before? There's nothing to do. I owe my mother a call. It's been weeks, and she's all alone. Loneliness is the central and inevitable fact of human existence. Someone is at my door, who is it? It's the mailman. He's a nice simple guy with a crush on me. Talks to me about World Cup soccer sometimes. Maybe I could ask him for a coffee, take things from there. Would I feel guilty if everyone's packages were late because I started a torrid affair with the mailman? It could be awkward if it didn't go well. My mind was always racing before. So many deadlines. Now it's calm. It's because of the amount of sleep I've been getting. Not setting the alarm in the morning is the greatest gift. I should have gotten a dog, even a rescue dog. But some of them are so crazy, like that lady that comes by the public pool with that dog that barks at anyone who tries to swim. What a nightmare. I'm so horny. I shouldn't have broken up with my boyfriend before all this. I blame myself. I miss my housekeeper. I wish something would happen. I've killed two people today. One more makes zero difference. Don't scream. Ah! Issued a stern warning to neighbors in the immediate vicinity of Green Valley to be on high alert and on the lookout for escaped inmate, Paula Mariah Roback, who is unstable, violent, and extremely dangerous. Sheriff Prosky begged the public not to try and take matters into their own hands, but rather call the office immediately so they can apprehend the suspect without further bloodshed. Paula Mariah Roback has a long and terrifying history... harkening back to her early teens... You call me that, I'll hurt you. Understand? My mother was a tone-deaf ho bag with no taste. Couldn't decide who she liked better, Paula Abdul or Mariah Carey. So I was stuck with a shit childhood. And learned to mop the floor with lippy bitches before I learned to read. Came up with my own brand of super karate. My whole life I've been fighting, so that's what my identity is based on. That's what the nice lady shrink keeps reminding me. What's your name? Leslie? - Are you gonna scream again? - Mm-mm. - Are you lying? - Mm-mm. Well? What? What's your name? Ivy. That's your Christian name? No. What'd your parents call you? Yvonne. What I mean right there. Yvonne sounds like a brand of tampon. School was no walk in the park for you, I bet. I borrowed your dress. Smells really good. The only good thing to come out of all this is that you can go anywhere wearing a mask, and nobody knows you're there to rob them 'til the last second. That's the only thing I'm gonna miss. You know gun shops are on the essential list now? Sex shops too. Someone has their priorities straight. Do you have a gun? What am I asking, of course you don't. If you had a gun, you never would have faced an intruder with an umbrella. How was that supposed to work? You're gonna stick the umbrella up the guy's ass and press the button, hoping it opened and paralyzed him? Hmm? I wasn't thinking. No kidding. Little home protection goes a long way. You can't keep me tied up like this. People will come looking for me. - What people? - People. Just because you're alone in the world doesn't mean I don't have any friends. You don't have to be a dick about it. My arms are numb. I can't feel my wrists. I have no blood circulation. I get sad when it rains. Having a rough life is no excuse to go around terrorizing people. What do you know about rough? I have a lot you don't know about me. Like what? One thing. Were you raised dirt poor on a farm? What if I was? So was I. Did your mother die in a gruesome tractor accident with your dad behind the wheel because they were both drunk? Did your one-armed uncle smuggle cigarettes and moonshine on a speed boat? There was a speed boat on a farm? The farm was next to a lake. It's like they say, "Truth is stranger than fiction." Come on, don't give me that. Of course truth is stranger than fiction. Fiction has to make sense. I'm not here for your entertainment. Stay focused. I am so sorry that took longer than I meant. Oh, my God, are you all right? I am so sorry. I know what it feels like to be left betrayed, abandoned, and humiliated. When I was 12, I was abducted by a white supremacist biker gang of Satan worshipers, The nice lady shrink says all my traumas stem from that moment. The fabric of my reality was torn or something. They meant to use me in a blood sacrifice ritual and tied me up to this makeshift altar and lit this big bonfire where they intended to cook me. I remember trembling, my whole body just vibrating, almost levitating. And I suppose I went into a trance. My mind went blank and focused on one simple thought, complete and total annihilation. This staggering feat of derring-do, one shell-shocked 12-year-old versus five twisted and depraved white supremacist Satan worshipers was reported on the news by this nasty blonde bitch who never quit smiling as she described the way that I massacred, with my bare little hands, those evil bikers. Which is why I can't stand the news, or Nazis, or heavy metal bands, or motorcycles. Which is why I broke your TV. I'm sorry for that. Ha! Oh... I got to say, most women don't look great in that, but you do. Seriously, plus you have amazing boobs. Come on, you never wanted to be someone's love slave? All women like a little rough trade from time to time. Hmm. We're all getting a little testy. Boy, I'm sweating like a nun in a cucumber field. You want to play 20 questions with me? Who's that? Who is that? The mailman. Why is he knocking on your door? He must need something signed. - Hey. - Hey, there. I don't mean to bother you, but did I drop off a package for 513 here yesterday by mistake? - No. - Oh. Also, I know you get this all the time, but I'm a huge fan of your work. Excuse me? Thanks so much. You shouldn't have done that. What do you think I did? Something funny. Did you do something funny? No. Were you a bad little bunny, Yvonne? No. Did you maybe ask the mailman for help? No. I wasn't born yesterday. I'm a little lost. I don't understand the things happening around me. I have experience, but little wisdom. This in itself is not unheard of. I've been told this as a sign of the times, a by-product of the hostile world we live in, a world adrift. It doesn't make me feel better about it, but I don't want to give up yet, even if no one sings me love songs, even If I don't yet have a convincing beginning for my new novel. ♪ Let me kiss ya ♪ ♪ Oh, how I wish that you would back up off this sucker ♪ ♪ I wish ya ♪ ♪ I wish you'd let me kiss you now, sing, baby ♪ ♪ Let me kiss ya ♪ ♪ Oh, how I wish you would back up off this sucker ♪ ♪ I wish you wish you wish you wish you ♪ ♪ Wish you'd let me kiss you now ♪ Hmm.

Is it? It is to me. I'd like do it more often. Me too. It's so nice without screens. Mm. That reminds me, I have a Zoom at 7:00. I should just... check if people replied. Can we not? Can we just carry on with this, you know, the specialness? - While it's still... - Special? Right. Can you not do that? - What? - With your foot. - I was here first. - What difference does that make? So I can move my foot where I like. Not if I'm here now. I'm here now and I don't want your foot invading my space. It was my space before you came. I had all of the space. Then you came and occupied it and took my space that I had saved for moving my foot into. - You sound like Israel. - Can you please move it? Maybe it's Palestine. Maybe it's Palestine. It feels like it was originally their space. - You have to share the space. - Says the UN. Please move it. Ow! Your nails are so sharp. - Israel! - No, you're Israel. I thought you said I was Palestine. Can you please just both stop. This was special. Can we just keep it that way for a minute before we start invading each other or... Take up more space than we need? Or start coming in and taking over perfectly happy people. Dad? Please, both of you can we not just all... Try and find a two cushion solution, please. Dad? Dad? Yes. What? I'm right here. - Is she Israel? - If you've got something to ask, you don't always need to keep saying "Dad," you have my attention just by talking without always... Dad? Sorry, I did not mean to do that. Say "Dad," I mean. - He-he. - You be quiet. Dad, sorry, is she Israel if I was here first? Stop calling me Israel. You don't even know what it means. It means that... - Stop it. Stop it. - Stop antagonizing. I want to learn. Ow, you scratched me again. Ow! You space-invading poupon jar. Okay, okay. You come over here. - Why do I have to move? - Just please come here. Daddy? - Hmm? - Am I Israel? No. Honestly, I don't know. She can say "Daddy," but I can't. Can you stop, please? Now, I think I got myself in a bit of a muddle with this one. Um... I think both Israel and Palestine think that they were there first. I think. Are you okay? Are you okay, Mom? It's pretty complicated. I'm sorry. It's not you. Oh, love. Oh, darling. I was just reading this beautiful thing about someone dying alone. Their family isn't allowed to be with them and... I just got scared for that ever happening to us. The people we love. To... to my dad. - Or Granny. - Or Granny. What about when Granny was a little girl all alone in the hospital with Scarlet Fever. What was she, eight? Six, I think. Six, isolated for six months. - I think it was eight. - Oh, whatever. All that time on her own. Her mom and dad waving at her through a window and a door. Terrified all the time. And if we ever had to mourn alone, separately, not together, I don't think I could take it. All the things we do when someone dies, we do together. Talk, drink. Tell stories, hold someone's hand. Actually, this is getting a little uncomfortable. Do you think you could get off? - Sorry, sorry. - It's okay. Ooh, I've got a great idea.

The reported coronavirus death toll in the... - I should have stayed. - Shh! Whether the number of deaths has been over-counted. Of course, that would fly in the face of Dr. Fauci's testimony... No, Dad, please use your walker. We want to come get you, but you gotta let your hip heal first so you got to move every day only with your walker - and only with your... - Are you seeing this?

I'll call you back after your nap, Dad. He's pissed, isn't he? So am I. I hate it here. Coyotes at night freak me out. My dad's gonna fall again. Where's he going? I don't know, maybe he's walking back to the city. My back is killing me. I think the mattress in that place is from the 1950s. Stop complaining. I think the plumbing is from the '50s too. Do you think Ben seems anxious? No. He seems pissed. You're the one who seems anxious. Well, I am anxious about my dad. Kimmy says his feet are getting worse. If we go back you can see your dad. I don't want to go back. How can we use the elevator? How can Ben see his friends? You know he'll want to see his friends. You wanna open that Pandora's box? - But your dad... - Don't use my guilt about my dad to get me to go back right now. - That is not fair. - Don't be so defensive. I'm not being defensive. Look, we can't stay here forever. Henry's gonna start charging us rent as soon as the state reopens. - He's doing us a favor. - So we pay. Are you kidding me? We can barely afford our rent back home. We need to start getting better about food. What? His teeth are hurting, he broke his braces. I know that. So I'll take him back to the city. And then the orthodontist sticks his hands in his mouth? Do you know how unsafe that is? We spent a lot of money on those braces. We can't start over again. Why do you keep making this all about money? Why won't you acknowledge that it's an issue? If you'd have taken that transfer six months ago, you wouldn't have been laid off right now. Sorry. How could I see that the world was about to implode? It's an emergency. It's his health, like your dad. - Don't. - So I'll take him alone. And then we're separated? No. Ben, you have to tell us how bad your teeth... Where is he? Ben? Ben? Ben! I'm right here. Ben.

I have no idea. ♪ She keeps crying all the time ♪ You know, I have been thinking a lot about what you told me, how like attracts like and how the frequency that you put out in the world is what comes back at you, and oh, my God. That's disturbing. I mean, this guy is the most selfish asshole I've ever met. What does that say about me? But you know, you know me, I just have this thing where I need to fix people. I'm a fixer. I don't know, I see a fucked up guy and I have this crazy impulse to make him eggs. Do you think Lester's going to come back? All right, no, don't answer. I don't care. I don't give a shit. He shouldn't come back. I don't care, right? The guy is driving me crazy, clearly, and it's just, there's so much uncertainty in the world. Why do I even want him back here? I don't know. It's like there's some fucking invisible cosmic noose wrapped around my neck, pulling me toward some sort of form of punishment or some sort of torture or something and... I sound like I'm a masochist, right? I mean, we... we've established that, right? I mean, you... you don't think I'm a masochist, do you? Oh, no. I mean, you seem to avoid pain at all costs. Right. Exactly. I mean, I don't understand why I'm staying with this guy. Why do I keep going back to him? It's like, why be with someone who doesn't treat me the way I deserve to be treated? It's the age old question, right behind, why are we here? What is our purpose in life? Why do I stay with this guy? My God, I sound like such a cliché. Really? I mean, this is embarrassing. You tell me to be authentic. You say I can say absolutely anything I want to. So, here you go. But really, truly, I mean, honestly, I just... I feel ashamed. I should be so much further along than I am right now. Don't be so hard on yourself. Oh, my God. Did I tell you about Saskatchewan? I can't believe I didn't tell you this. This is exactly... Okay. Remember when I was in Saskatchewan right before this whole lockdown thing happened? Well, I went to the Museum of... um, Natural History of... Or Science or Archaeology, I don't know. It was the only place that was open on a Sunday. And so I go there and I have to tell you, like, all week long, I was kind of freaking out because that memory of my sister, remember the one that I'm, like, pounding on the door, pounding on the door, pounding on the door, like, let me in. Like, let me in, let me in and she's not letting me in and listen, I know we've been through this ad nauseam. Like, I get it. She's not letting me in. It's like the way this fuck face isn't letting me in. And I'm... Why do I need someone to let me in? Why can't I let myself in, right? I mean, sure, she locks the door, but why don't I just have a key? If I have a key, I can let myself in. Anyway. So inside the building... Inside the building, there was a giant kaleidoscope, okay? And, like... You, like, kind of... You walk in and then under and then you're inside the kaleidoscope. Like, surrounded by all these shattered lights, all these fractured mirrors, and somehow when I went in there, like, it hit me, like, it hit me really hard. I was weeping. I mean, it felt so real that I could feel how tense I was, you know, how desperate I was to get to the door. And as I'm pounding on the door to my sister, like, "Let me in." It hit me so hard. I mean, I don't know. I mean, maybe it was the mushrooms because I had taken them right before I got there, but I don't think so. You know, it was more than that. I think there was some little thing that unlocked this little gnat, like, bugging me. Why in my subconscious do I keep thinking about this moment that I'm pounding and pounding and crying, crying, and all of a sudden, I saw the end of the scene. She let me in, but when she let me in, she's really mean to me. She was just like, "Oh, if you come in, "you have to do exactly what I say," in this kind of really sadistic sort of way. But if it meant getting into the room, I had to take it. I had to take it. It just means, like, love, you know, goes hand in hand with being treated like shit, I guess. She represented love and safety in a house where no one was home. You're scared and lonely and seeking protection. You took what was offered. That... That's the seed of your struggle right there. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It's pretty fucking heavy. That's been your pattern. And... And now that you know that, you don't want to reinforce the pattern by accepting the bad behavior Les is offering you. Mm. Right. Whoa. Whoa, I totally get this. So if he comes back, I should ask him to leave. I don't want to be alone now. Now's not the best time for that. Who wants that? It's scary out there. I mean, but his whole, "Oh, I need some space" thing. It's such bullshit. "Oh, it's springtime. I think I have to wander." Fuck you. And if he really loved me, he would stay. But if I really love myself, I'd asked him to leave. It's a confusing time for everybody. Shells were a sign. What shells? I didn't tell you about the shells? When it was finally okay to go outside, we decided to go to the beach, you know, get some fresh air. And on the shore, I found the most amazing open shells. They look like these little butterflies and, I don't know, seemed like a... A symbol of hope or something, that maybe we've evolved, turned into something really wonderful. But when I looked at them this morning, they'd all broken apart. Oh, everything feels so scary to me right now. I just want to feel safe, loved. Is that asking for too much? And I know he's been texting his ex. How do you know that? Because I heard her ding. I know I could tell her ding anywhere. I mean, her ding lingers like bad perfume. Oh, yeah. It's definitely her. And then when I confronted him with it, he totally tried to gaslight me, told me that I was crazy. - You're not crazy. - I know I'm not crazy. You're definitely not crazy. I know. You're the sanest person I know. I know. I mean, I caught him lying. - Lying's not cool. Fuck him. - Fuck him. His smell changes when he lies. - Really? - Yeah, and he shuffles his feet when he feels guilty about something. Huh. How come you've never said anything like that to me before? I don't know, You seemed to dig him. I tried to be supportive. Well, you know, it is what it is. I mean, it's good that we know all this stuff, right? I mean, it... it's sad, but as they say, it's always darkest before the dawn. Hmm. That's the time you like to eat your crunchy cereal. Why don't we get into bed and watch C hernobyl again?
