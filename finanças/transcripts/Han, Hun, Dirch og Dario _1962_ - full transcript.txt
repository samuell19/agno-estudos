(music from the radio) 8.22.50, beep. They heard the melodies from the film "He, She, Dirch and Dario." (she sighs) - Do not do that. That is mine. - Everything that is yours is mine. You said that 3 years ago when you carried me over the threshold. - What date is it today? - The fourth... Why that? - Nothing. - Listen to this. Among the danish contestants in the Grand Prix' at Roskilde Ring - - we now also find the Borg Factories represented. Director Alfred Borg have announced participation - - with his new Flying Sport, driven by his son, the well-known... ... beautiful, elegant, charming, well-groomed... Talented! ... sports driver Poul Borg. Won't it amuse the others to see my rear wheels from far away? Or your wife to hear what you think of her on short distance. - What's the matter now? - I just feel a little unmarried. - Nonsense. - Yes, nose down in the newspaper. And then thanks for coffee and out to cranks and odometers. - It's my work. - Other men also have work, still got time to privacy. Weren't we together most of the sunday? At a car show, yes. From 13-18. - I have to see what the others are doing. - There are theaters... Or a nice evening at home... - Beloved! - What?! - What is it now? - Say it again. "Beloved" It's been so long since I heard that. (the phone is ringing) I'm always nervous when you race. - Nothing has happened. - It will in time. Hey Marianne, it's Henry. Has Poul left? No, he's right here. ... It's Henry. - Hello there. - They have called from the factory. - The Jaguar has arrived. - Nah! The Jaguar has arrived. - (the doorbell rings) - I'll be back in a quarter of an hour. I'm going down to test it at the Ring this afternoon. - Morning, little Frederik. - Congratulations on the anniversary. - Shhh. - Has he forgotten? - It's too wrong. - Nonsense. He'll probably think about it. Now I have my whole day. I got pheasants, beans and fruit. I think I have it all. I'll set a festive table with three lights. One for each year. The flowers can stand in the middle. - The Jaguar has arrived. - Where should it be? - It's a car... I'm running away. - Take me to Baptiste. I'll be back in a few hours. Farewell for now. It's the worst about them, the speed, they have on. - Come home a little early tonight. - Yes. Yes. Madame... hello, Madame Borg. - How astonishing you look. - Oh, monsieur. Et votre robe... Monsieur Baptiste a russi a une creation sensationelle. Mademoiselle? La robe de madame Borg, s'il vous plait. Good morning. Bring it on, Soerensen. Model of all time, huh? C"est manifique. What would I do without you? Madame, you are complete. - Now you are exaggerating. - Exaggerate? - Think if you were mine. - Is it a proposal? Yes, madam. Determine your salary yourself. None of my mannequins can measure with your measurement. (the push) (honk) (honks) (honk) (honk) (engine stops) - Don't you want more? - It's not me who doesn't want to. - Did you remember petrol? - Yes, of course. I have to notify the nearest tank. Have you seen, what's coming there? - Good morning, can we have coffee here? - Yes. - What do you need? - 3 pieces sugar and 1 danish bread. - Hello. - Good day. - Good day. What are you doing here? - I want to try the track. - Did he bring the can? - Yes, thanks. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Whoa, we saw her first. - But I'm the most beautiful. That such a lovely girl can drive that well. - My cart has its advantages. - It doesn't like strangers. But you can't get up to the right speed here at home, the distance are too short. - Have you tried other places? - Yes, Monte Carlo. I lived there a few years. I was a part of some races, but didn't win. I came home the day before yesterday. - What does "L" mean? - Laura. "P" means Poul, if that's of any interest. "Poul," nice. Shall we go for a few laps? - Yes. What at stake? - A dinner. Fine. Now they come! 54.08. They were lucky, huh? (the phone is ringing) Yes? - Just give my wife a message. - Don't you want to speak to the lady herself? Nah... I won't come for dinner. I have to eat with a co-worker. An old friend, a cool guy. What do they say? I will let the message pass. Goodbye... Seawide explanation. - Who was it? - It was your husband. - Nah... What did he want? - He's not coming to dinner. - Oh, no! - He eats with a colleague. Nah... Bring it on. - With what? - With what presses you. - What would it be? - I didn't know, why I ask. - There is something I haven't told. - There is a lot. You didn't say where you went to school... - I'm married. - Well, and what then? Here we sit, the two of us... all alone. My wife thinks I'm with one of the guys. - Have you told her that? - Yes. - Why? - I couldn't really say... To what? Do you think I'm in love with you? Not at all. Of course not. But I think you're a very, very sweet guy. Do you know what I think too? ... That we should dance. - We're going somewhere else. - Poor Marianne! We haven't seen anything. You do not say anything! - Hi! - Hi. - Are you mad? - Disappointed that I'm alone tonight. Why? Was there anything special tonight? - It's our wedding day. - No! - Yes... - Oh, dammit. Think I could forget it. Pardon. I've made a nice dinner for you... your favourite. Pheasants? It's almost too bad for me. - Were they good? - Don't know. I didn't eat anything. Then there must be something left... Shouldn't we have a little gnawing leg? - Do you love me? - No. I thought so. (the phone is ringing) - Hello? - Marianne? It's Lilly. - Good night. What will you? - Listen to this... - Where is the toothpaste? - At the shelf, right in front of you. - Are you there? - Yes, I am here. We wanted to go out to eat tonight and... - Let it be, Poul, it tickles. - Is Poul at home? It does not matter. ... Now leave it, you teasing stick. - See you at the hairdresser's tomorrow? - We can do that. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Who did you talk to? I was just asking what time it was. - Who was it? - Lilly. - What did she want? - I don't know that, wasn't anything special. - You shouldn't be around Lilly. - Why not? - She's a crap-intriguer. - I have never noticed that. - Does it fit there? - Yes, please. - What is it, you wanted? - I can't get it said... - What do you say? - I can't get it said... - Her there... - Lovely girl. - It is her! - Who? - Your husband's friend. - What do you say? Do you understand... Please stay under the dryer helmet. (a key is put in the door) Marianne? Marianne? Has something happened? You look so strange. No, what should have happened... for example? So much can happen. - On what occasion? - No special reason. You do that so often... present your loved one with flowers. Now you have to see what I bought. Champagne. Are you staying home tonight ... or are you going out again? You can believe that I won't. Look here, oysters. You love oysters, right? Tonight we will have a cozy evening, just the two of us. (soft music) (the music stops) - Play it again. - Well, love, it's so sad. Yes, but it fits fittingly. I'm also sad in my mood. - I love that record. - You got too much to drink. - So did you. - Not as much as you. - Shall we Dance? - I can't dance with you. - Yes, you can. - You have to promise to dance properly. Darling, how boring you are. No... don't. No, we have to dance as if we don't know each other at all. - We know each other well. - Yes... Aah... aah... I can't stand it at all. The music, the champagne and... No, I'm so unhappy. - I am so unhappy, Poul. - Yes, you are. You know what... deep down I love you. Then I really love you. I can't help it at all. - Then let's go to bed. - Yes... No! - Poul, if you knew... - I will. Isn't it terrible? Tomorrow you'll get a big surprise... - What do you mean by that? - With what? Tomorrow... what surprise will I get? "What's dead is dead. No bells can revive it." Now you must not talk about death and burial. You are always startled by death, and that is the only certainty. Don't think about that now. Let's go to bed. Aah, you don't care. "What's dead is dead. None..." - "Bells." - "Bells can bring it to life." A great poet has said that. Why do I have to go up there? I'd rather stay down there. - No. - Yeah... What is it? What are you doing? - I'm just looking at you. - You're a crazy. Now we have to sleep. - I have asked myself for advice. - We have to sleep now. - Aah, aah, aah... - Shut up! Shhh. (the phone is ringing) Marianne, the phone... Marianne! Marianne, the phone! Yes? What?... Who? It's a wrong number. Marianne? Marianne? Marianne! (a car door close) - What does this mean? - The lady has left us. - What does it mean? - It's terrible, the lady has left. The lady called for a taxi, and then I helped her with the suitcases. - Did she leave no address? - No. The chauffeur... didn't you hear what she said to him? - No... - Well done, Frederik. Well done! It's ridiculous. Completely ridiculous. Didn't she say why she left? No, but there is a letter for you upstairs. (he whistles) - (rings) - It might be the missus. - Hello, hello... - Frederik! The lady said she would call. Yes, she wants to know how I took it. I took it completely calm. You saw me opening the letter. I smiled a little and went downstairs and got ready. And you heard me sing in the bathroom. - Are you there? I sang! - (he smacks the door) Aah, please wait a moment. Is there anything I can be of service with? - They have a studio for rent. - Yes, it is this way. It's the lady who needs to see the room... It's my daughter. 22 at most 23, wealthy, sad. Sorry, she's started studying psychology at school. Shall we rise to the top? - Pretty staircase. - From the 17th century. Griffenfeldt visited a lady here. Yeah, it wasn't me. Yes, then we're here. It's the bathroom... jointly. - Down there, the kitchen is... shared. - You, Jenny! - What do you say then? - Brilliant. ... in a festive, sweeping swirling chorus No one sits, stands or stops where the Naplitians live... Can't you two take a break? (song continues) - They should have been thrown out. - You do not mean that. It's Mario and Eigil. Mario sings. She is completely silly with him. Now you must see the room. Aah, it's cozy here. She was also sad that she had to leave here, the one who lived here. She just moved. Do you like it? - Yes. I want to live here. - It was nice. Welcome. - What about the rent? - That's what we're talking about. - When will you move in? - Now. I have the suitcases down there. We have so many young people. They give a hand. ... they accept invitations from whoever offers them up the whole of Naples is trolling and floundering with humor at fast and... each street abounds with tones, even with fat wives they accept invitations from whoever invites them the whole of Naples is trolling and frolicking in the humor of aunts and uncles goes up in heavenly heights right where the Neapolitans live signorinas with rustling shoe peas spring out like alpine violets in bloom get red cheeks and flirts there where napo... - What do you want now?! - Have help with Latin words. - Get your mom to do it. - She doesn't know Latin. Find someone else. You arrive at crazy times. Yesterday it was the clock. My watch had stopped. - Look at it in the restaurant. - I didn't think of that. You only think of coming and disturbing. We are busy. Pardon... You could have helped her now. She always runs and glares at me. - She is lukewarm on you. - I could be her father! Then you would have been a precocious diaper child. Shall we grab it again? Why is he like that, the one I like always get thrown out and the door is smacked in No nice words which get the pulse to strike Nothing of that each girl awaits why does he never say he likes me him i like Not even a smile does he have to give me him i like if he only knew I could "explain" it how I walk and how I feel inside there is not one on this earth like him i like No one is as divine and as grand like him i like the knees shake the heart beats everything is poetry and cling-clang when he passes him i like but what am I the smallest and poorest disheveled little gray-sparrow on his way so what about me why live at all when he doesn't even see that I exist all day long I try to forget him, I like but even at night I hear his voice, the one I like I never get sleep in my eyes because I think of him I like. - Is there something wrong? - Marianne has run away. She is gone. I woke up this morning, then she was gone. - Where? - Have no idea. There was a letter. - She must have heard something. - Really... think so? The other day I saw you, when I was at this restaurant... ... with a lady I know. - You don't think I've been gossiping, do you? - No, but Lilly. - I told her to shut up. - Lilly... shut up?! Hah. It's your own fault. An honest married man doesn't do that. There is no more between Laura and me, - - than between you and... the ledger keeper. Miss Thomsen?! What the hell do you mean, Poul? - There is no more! - The bookkeeper?! (there is a knock on the door) (it knocks again) - Enter! - Excuse me, Monsieur Baptiste. (he barks out in French) - Impossible a craer! Qui est-ce? Bon, faites la entrer. Go ahead. Bonjour, Madame Borg. Prenez place. Your dress? They are not satisfied? Yes, it is wonderful. It's not that at all. Voilà. The last time I was with you, you said some nice words about my figure. They suggested I model for you and be employed here. - That was probably your joke. - Yes, I would never dare to... - Madame, you mean... - Yes, if the offer stands. - Madame... say it again. - I have to make money. Madame, this is the happiest day of my life. - When, madam? - Now... now right away. Mademoiselle! Quickly. Lycoenian me. Madame Borg has allowed herself to be attached to my shop. Madame Borg mannequin chez Baptiste. Le beige! Tournez-vous. Encore un peu. A qui. No. Alors... duchesse. (The town hall clock strikes 12) - Well... it's not you. - Me? - Where is Lisa? - The previous tenant has left. - Without telling me? - Yes, apparently. Nah... yes, yes. You, Eigil... Lisa has left. Lisa has left. A new one has arrived. Good day, welcome. Mario got together with Lisa a bit. When he had time... if he didn't have an appointment with... I just moved in and I want to unpack. - Now we have to help you. - No... It was just missing. - Where are the hangars? - Inside the closet. - No... how gorgeous it is. - Now I'll fix it myself. - Isn't there more we can do? - No thanks. - Dust off, polish a boot... - I want to go to bed. - Now we will arrange it for you. - No... Yes, yes, yes! When Mario has set his mind on something, there is nothing to do. It was about the bed. Yes, why not! Making a bed is a bit of an art it requires manual labor prove two lads the favor to make yours today a bed must be puzzled with imagination for us it's a game we know the art for sure We are not novices for a thousand beds with quilts in them has crossed our path mark how easily and gallantly a sheet is put on you spread it from edge to edge in the hope that it can reach a lovely head needs rest when the day's toil is over why we place pillows two with grace and talent here you can doze off happily with the nose facing upwards in the end there is only the quilt again to adjust carefully There is nothing easier than that like that and like that now we hope to rest the sheep when we have left you for even a virgin in rough living must sleep well tonight as said, we glide like the clock strike and the thieves take hold. - Good night. - Good night...

After knowing for 20 minutes he said to my mother: "Sei la piu bella signorina di Napoli." - Then they got married and had me. - They're Italian, huh? My father fell out with Mussolini in '38. Then we moved up here. Then my parents bought a shop... Don't you like me? - Yeah. - Do you care about spumante? - What is that. - Italian champagne. I have some bottles.

Sei la piu bella signorina di Copenhagen. I hate him... Mario. He sits with the new one. He looks at her, like a cat on a mouse. - Don't worry. He looks at all girls like that. - Not that me. You're no girl either... I mean in that sense. - I am 16 years old. - Yes, but you're in school. - And Mario is an old man. - He's an idiot.

Yes, yes, yes. an accident has happened. - What is it? - If an accident were to happen. If the gentleman goes astray. It would be nice with the address. - Yes. Do you have something to write with? - Yes. I live in Christianshavn. Over street, above the water 52. Over street, above the Water 52... - Yes, do you have it? - Yes, thank you, ma'am. - How is it, by the way? - It's going... fine, my lady. The Lord read the letter and took it completely calmly. He smiled... and sang in the bathtub. Oh, but it was good. Goodbye, Frederik. Goodbye, madam. Excellent, Frederik. Thank you very much. (playing and talking) You drink too much. Hep! Mario... shall we turn on the ignition? - (Mario laughs) - Yes, I think so. Hush... hush, everyone.

(step on the stairs) - (she knocks) - Come in. Hi! It's not because anyone has complained... yet. Go ahead and sit down. A bit of a downer for grandma. No further than up to the edge. - Cheers. - Cheers, cheers. - I just found out he has skills. - Because he has. Exactly what Lisa said, and Karen and… - It was the voice. - Well, his bass tenor. - He inherited that from his father. - Him with the store? Store? Call Napoli and ask if they remember Alexandro Carusi. - The opera was full when he sang. - And his son just thrashes around. What do you want? - Shall I stand on the King's New Square? - Not bad. He could easily become a chamber singer. I said: "Get your act together, give someone a test." Try Lublinski... Carlo Lublinski, the best we have, deliverer of singers. - Do you know him? - I went to sing with him. Nice man. We got a little engaged. Isn't there a lot of smoke here? Shouldn't we get some air? Play up, boys. We're going to dance. The first time I was in love was now today, was now last night in you and no one else has fell in love now last night as high as me every smile on your lips and the scent of your hair will follow me as long as God's green Earth stands because never before was I that in love like now last night in you, in you the first time I fell in love is it in one that does not look at me perhaps others have been in love but not as high as me for deep in my heart his image, tenderly I bear but all my great longing is of no value because he is probably in love but no trace in me... Do you know where I meet Marianne Borg? ... the first time I was in love was now today, was now last night in you and no one else has fell in love now last night as high as me every smile on your lips... ... because never was I so in love like now last night in you, in you. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Yes, there is. Have I done anything to you? They're after the only man I've ever loved. I saw you well last night through the keyhole. Shall I let you in on a secret? You mustn't tell anyone, no one here knows. I am married... and I love my husband. How nice it is. Now I'm going to get your tea. - What are you looking for? - I need a new dress. It's very pretty that one on the backside. Yes, for sports use. I'm looking for an evening thing. What about that? - That lady, is she employed there? - I presume so. If you want to buy it, can you get the lady to put it on? You can get her to put it on. It's her job. I think it's beautiful. It will suit you. - It's Jenny. - Do you remember her? Yes of course. As if I could forget her. She sang so terribly. Like a flea door. But she was a sweet little girl. I think we were a bit taken with each other. - Yes, I got that. - Well, did you? Well, hang her up again and say hello from me. Yes, goodbye. It wasn't about her. - Who was that then? - A young man we know. We will ask you to listen to him. Why I? Why do I have to get involved in all this stuff? - Jenny says, You are the best. - What... is she saying that? Yes, I am too. Then let's hear him. - Thank you very much. When? - Yes... what is it today? - It's thursday. - Then it's Friday tomorrow. Let him come up to me tomorrow Friday at 3 pm. Excuse me, how long does Monsieur Baptiste think that... - When we're done. - Yes, for the lordship... Je m"en fous de lordship. Commega. Parfait. Voici la robe. Madame Marianne. A dream, right? I call it "Rave a rose." Not bad, not bad. Can I see a twist to port side? - I think it's dripping a little? - Dripping? It may look like this. What do you think, baby? Yes, it is delightful. I'm just afraid of the pattern. Yes... it's terrifying. - Monsieur! - To my little friend, I mean. - What else do you have for evening snacks? - Evening meals? - Monsieur wants to see another creation. - Yes, or more. A bee. Madame Marianne... - Why do you say honey to me? - Did I say that? I'm not your little friend either. Otherwise, I liked that dress. - You said that the pattern... - I was afraid of it. Don't walk around in something you're afraid of... We have plenty of time. - No!! - Hurry up now. - I'm not going there! - Stop with that nonsense. You should be ecstatic. If you one more time say "I don't want," you'll get smacked. - Can I see your nails. - Oh, shut up. He says this to an old friend who wants to accompany him. - So. Is he pretty? - Wonderful. - Shut up! - He said only shut up to you, worse to me. - I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you. - I'm not going there at all. - Then we left. - Me?! For singers teacher? I repeat: "Then we went." Luck, luck, Mario. - Good luck. - Thanks. "La rose noir." Monsieur, you have seen everything. I can no more. - You... - One moment. - We would like to see the first one again. - Over again? - Yes, thanks. - Nah, I'll take it as it is. Mademoiselle... merci. As I recall, there was only talk of one. - Yes, my friend.. - Let him sit down as long. Come here, let me look at you. Yes, you are too tall. - Give me an A. - An A? - But Mr. Professor... - Can I have that A. My time is precious. Aaa... chicken feet and carrots and the neck of a swan... - Will you please stop! - You asked... Such a fog horn. Are you making fun at me? No, you misunderstand. I'm just joining. With him there. Stand up and let the professor hear you. All Naples sings and dances in a festive sweeping swirling chorus No one sits, stands or stops there where the Napolitans live there is a kiss with beating hearts... What kind of terrifying manners do you have? Well, I'm not done. How high can you go? - An A, an H. - Good... Move. - Do you sing from the magazine? - Yes. Then try it here. Never mind the words. You cannot pronounce them. It's your height I want to hear. Che bella cosa na jurnata a sole n"aria se... - That's Italian. - It's my mother's tongue. Call Naples and ask what they think of his father. It was sold out every time he sang. There is only one who has been able to do that - - my old friend Alexandro Carussi. Sir. professor, that's him I'm talking about. - Who? - That's him I'm talking about. Is... is it... No... are you the son of Alexandro and Tina, - - my old friends! How are they? - Where are they? - Here in Copenhagen. And I have no idea? I want to go to them now. They are not at home. They are in Italy. - You? - My parents. They're on vacation. Well, in Italy? Well, then... No, I don't have time for that. Then we have to wait. We'll go here one more time. I think you inherited your father's voice. Che bella cosa na jurnata a sole ma n"ata sun chiu bello, oje ne o sole mio (Italian song) o sun o sun mio (rings) (Italian song) Good day...

The first time I was in love was now today, was now last night in you and no one else has fallen in love now last night, so loud... Pardon. - Who was it? - It was... my husband. (the orchestra plays "Carmen") - Where is he? - He'll come. Petersen, come here. - Hasn't Giovanni come? - No. - Have you called the hotel? - He left 2 hours ago. - Where is he then? - Well... There he is. Giovanni! I consider it a breach of contract if it happens again. - Ma dove a stato? - My voice... He has lost his voice. He can't sing. - Che successo now? - Ha perso la voce. Che facciamo adeso? (sings scales) No, I've said it 17 times. Do not. Again. Stop looking up in the heavens, you won't get there anyway! Again. No, no, no! Here it is. Sit over here, you will see. - Look, I've only been 3 months. - You're beautiful. Do you think? - It's from my first prom. - Who is he? - Leif. He was smithened for me. - Ugly. There I am out for a ride in Dyrehaven. - Who is he? - It's also Leif. Do you know what he did? He fell off the horse. Laura... now it's like I've known you since you were little. Then there's something I want to ask. But you have to take it calmly. Yes. Uh... Won't you please turn around? Thanks. Laura, I'm not a good-looking guy like that Leif. And I don't have a horse, but I have my guitar. I just got an offer to be permanently on the radio. And I... just got new clothes... ... so the future should be at home. And then it was... that... ... if it's not too much that I wanted to ask you about... - (the doorbell rings) - Oh! Would you ask me if I would marry you? - Yes. - (the doorbell rings) I have to talk to your dad immediately. - It is director Thomsen. - Giovanni has fallen ill. I would like to. Thanks. - What about him Robin? - He is singing in Vienna at the moment. - Bjorling... - He flew to New York yesterday. What should I do? (you hear Mario sing) It is sold out for the whole week. - Who is it? - It's a young man. By the way, it is a son of... (you hear Mario sing) No, then we'll do it like they do in the terrifying music movies. Well, but let's try. (Mario sings) - Well? - We try. Yes. It was magnificent. You can neither stand, walk or play comedy. But you can sing. I'll teach you the rest before the general exam tomorrow. Maestro! "Entrada del toreador." - Can I go over now? - Yes, you can. Poul... - What do you want? - I wanted to greet you before... Drive carefully, you hear. Here, there is no access for unauthorized persons. The next race is Formula Junior. We're going to see the brand new wagon, - - Flying Sport and it is driven by Poul Borg. He meets several of our best drivers. Fritz Moeller, Conradsen and several others. Who will get under Lukas hill first? I think it was Conradsen. He is still driving. It's going well. Let's hope it lasts like that. They take the next turn. Still Conradsen in the lead. But Poul Borg is approaching. He's in third place. In 2nd place. They are inside the Pirelli turn now. Now Poul Borg has taken the lead. There are three cars on row. But still Poul Borg, who is ahead. Then comes the rest of the field. Still leads Poul Borg. Conradsen after and Fritz Moeller. Still Poul Borg. He has increased the lead. Now another car is gaining on him. It's Conradsen. Back into the swing. Poul Borg takes the lead. Can he really... Now a carriage passed by! Now they entered the turn. The red flag is coming out. Something must have happened. Now we get the ambulance on the field. We are waiting to hear from over there. It will be announced now. Conradsen had taken the lead. To avoid smashing him - - Poul Borg is crashed. We await further notice. Dear Our Lord. Won't you make it so that Mario will be a success tonight. - What time is it? - 10 minutes in half. Are you done? Move a little, baby. - How do I look? - Magnificent. Tell Eigil I'm calling for a carriage now. - It will probably be interesting. - Yes, it does. (Mario sings) So what? Yes, it's true. (Mario continues) - Good luck. - Thanks. - What do you want now?! - It doesn't say that. Mother calls for a carriage. You have to go. The clothes... the clothes... Good luck. Mario, you can borrow this one. - It's my lucky animal. - Nonsense. Don't worry about him. There's nerves on the boy. - It suits you. - Do you think? Yes, but it makes you look youthful. At your age, you don't want to look younger, do you? If I were you and Mario were to like me, - - then I would go to Marianne and borrow a dress. - Marianne has left. - Yes, she is... Then I'll go, if there's nothing more I need to help with. Now I have to turn off the television. Remember to take alternating baths. Alternately hot and cold, right? It's good for the feet. Bye for now. Get well soon. We are moving to the Falkoner Centre, where we will observe - - the Italian guest ensemble's performance of "Carmen." Here is your ticket. I go up and give Mario the last oil. (audience claps) (the orchestra plays) (female squeal) - Mario Carrussi's wardrobe? - It's just around the corner. Then we'll get to it. It's going to be interesting, isn't it? Stop talking to him! Don't you want some music to warm up to? Don't worry, it's only in the 2nd act that you have to enter. Come here. Good luck, kid. Are you nuts! That's the worst thing you can say to an artist. - It means bad luck. - Accident?! Ha! What can happen to him now? Nothing. (Giovanni enters singing loudly) - Who is that? - Giovanni has regained his voice. What about Mario? Father-in-law, promise me you haven't seen him. Giovanni, you have changed your wardrobe. Yes, wardrobe... Well, shall we sit and watch the show? No, I want to follow this one from the stage. (Eigil tries Italian) Maestro! (Giovanni yells in Italian) (the performance begins) - Where is he? - He is neutralized. In the basement. I have put a wardrobe in front. (Giovanni cries for help) Dead and agony. Laura sits and waits for me. I'll go to the hall. - Bye, bye! - I kill you, ciao, ciao. Do not! They may not! (the doer is smacked in) Yes, it was a boring one. (audience claps) Sweetest Marianne... how I feel sorry for you. - What happened? - Poul, a little accident. He knocked over with the wagon, and people yelled and screamed. - Where is he? - At home. I have to go home. Goodbye. (calling in for the 2nd act) (the orchestra begins to play) (dancing and singing) Yes, then it is you. - I dare not! - Stop making a scene. So, in! Show them what you're good at. (Mario sings) (everyone claps) Bravo, excellent. Yes, listen... (television blares) Gangster! I do not want this anymore. - Salute. - Salute. - May I also congratulate you? - Thanks. Just a moment. Think we should meet again, the two of us, eh? You are still just as young and just as adorable. Aren't you going to get new glasses soon, huh? Hello. - Father, have you seen Eigil? - Nah. Since it is impossible to get his autograph, I withdraw. No, I withdraw. And they drag you along. We all end up at my house. Mario, you take off your make-up and come quickly. Shall I come too? I didn't sing tonight. No, heaven be graced... Congratulations. Thanks. Well, you are... Wait for me while I change, okay? He must be somewhere. - He'll probably show up. - Eigil! - Hi! - Giovanni! Where do they come from? Venice. He cheats, so the water leaks from him. (everyone laughs) - Petersen, You switch off everywhere. - Yes. - How dark it is. Where are we? - On the stage. Come. Give me your hand. Only here was a little light. (it sounds like the orchestra is rehearsing) Prego, maestro. (heavy classical music) No, no, no, no... (lighter classical music) (cuts into dance music) The first time I was in love was now last night in you, in you I'm a little girl at 16 and a half but what does age matter when you mean everything pretty night be merciful against two and bestow upon us your starry sky let your moon... because never was I so in love like now last night in you, in you like now last night in you, in you I went and was in love, I went like a drunk now I know it will be reciprocated now I give you a hug the sky is great and victory is ours for no one else has fallen in love - tell me now tonight - as high as I every smile on your lips and the scent of your hair will follow me as long as God's green Earth stands I was never so in love with you as now last night in you never was I so in love like now last night in you, in you. --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
