Not again. I so wish I lived in that mansion. It's very expensive. I know, but... Come on, please? I can't waste money. Hey! Hey, listen! From that mansion you'd have a great view! It's obvious, right? I have to go now. - This is for you. - Thank you. - Have fun, guys. - Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Please come again. Hey, listen. I heard you're moving into a mansion. A luxury mansion in Aoyama. All our neighbors are celebrities. Wow. So I guess this common club is beneath your dignity. Well, I was going to resign after tonight. What? Come on, you're a valuable asset of this club. But look, at last I live in a mansion. I feel out of place here. Come on, I was just joking. Please, don't make a rash decision. I want to work in a luxury club. - Are you good there? - Perfect. - You're all set up. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. It's not good. Wait, it's gonna get better. I'm so happy to live in this mansion. Thank you, darling. Sorry, I'm not in the mood today. I'm going back home. What's wrong? You told me I'd see more from a mansion. Now you're mad. Please don't be! You know how much this place costs me? I'm sorry, forgive me. Papa, I promise! You'll find good views next time. Please don't be mad at me! Please! - Please, Papa! - I have to go anyway. Takuji. Wow, what a surprise. What are the odds of meeting you? Do you live in the neighborhood? Yes, in that mansion there. Oh. I'm so glad to see you. Right, you remember our graduation day? That was an odd way to part. Ayu-chan, I never forgot you. But you're married now? No, I'm not married yet. I see. Please, come in. Wow. This is a gorgeous place. It's simple. I have to manage on my salary. Please, sit down. This is amazing. Seeing a splendid place like this... I thought you had a sugar daddy. That's not flattering. You see, I'm a model now, in fashion. Are models that rich? Sure, once you're getting famous. So, you're a famous model. How about you? Well, I can't compare with your success. I just started my business. But that's amazing! That's so modern, so dynamic. And it suits you so well. Yes. Ayuko. I told you about that luxury club in Ginza. I spoke with Mr. Maruyama, director of Sanei Ltd... and he could have you meet the manager tonight. It's going to take me some time to get ready. What? Alright, alright! I'll go! It's my agent, there's a rush job. That late at night? I'm so sorry, today of all days. Don't worry, it's fine. Alright then. I'm sorry about that. Takuji, shall we meet again? Sure. I could call you as soon as I'm free. There. See you. Bye-bye. So plain. Thank you for coming. Pleased to meet you. Mr. Maruyama recommended you, but we can't hire you. Really? It's regrettable and I'm sorry. Oh, it's not that you're not pretty... or that you lack refinement. There's nothing personal about it. It's just that we have strict requirements. Is that right? You don't fit our profile. - Sorry for disturbing you. - My apologies. Really? Well, we did our best. Don't worry, we'll find something. I treated him like a king for that recommendation. I found one! Yes! I'm so glad. He found one. Weekly Magazine Joy That one is a pervert. Probably a boss with his secretary. Come, come. Wow, amazing! I'm so glad you found one. Hey, let me! At last I was blessed with a mansion lifestyle. But I felt empty... now that my dream had come true. Can we ever be happy? Please, I'd like to talk to Mr. Okawa from management. Hey, Takuji, it's Ayuko. I'm so sorry about last time. What? Right. I have a sudden opening in my schedule. Perfect, I'm not too busy at work. Alright, I get it. See you. You always dine here? That is, when I don't cook. Excuse me a minute. Hey, hello. - Do you know them? - I don't. She probably moved in recently. Yeah, probably. She doesn't yet know how to behave. She thinks we all greet each other. Right. Uh? What is that? An astronomical telescope? When I'm lonely, I watch the stars. It relaxes me. No! No! Don't! Let's go to the bedroom. In my wildest dreams... I never thought I'd have you one day. And I rejected you... but I kept yearning for your embrace. Ayu-chan... You live on this floor? Yes, in apartment 703. A pleasure. Yes, it's a pleasure. Morikawa, Apt. 701 Yes, this is Ms. Fukuzawa. What? Mrs. Morikawa? Ah, I'm sorry about earlier. No, it's a pleasure. I need to talk to you. Do you mind if I come over? Really? You're so kind. Alright then, I'm coming right now. Yes. Coming! Please, come in. I'm sorry I invited myself. It's OK, I had nothing special to do. Please. Please. Right. This is a very simple present, a token of neighborliness. Really? That's so kind of you. In fact, I have a favor to ask. We met in the corridor today... Yes? That man who was with me... Please don't mention him to my husband. Your husband is that person we met in the lobby? It's not that anything questionable is going on with him. It's just that my husband hates it when he visits our home. Please be at peace. Of course I won't tell him anything. I'm so grateful... I'll be going, then. You could stay a while longer. I was so glad to have a guest. But my husband is coming back soon. I see. We'll have other occasions to socialize. You're sure you'll come back? - Goodbye. - Bye. Not that one. Let me see that one here. Yes. I think this will do. - How much? - It's 4,500 yen. I'll be back. Do you like it? Thank you, I really like it. You always had good taste. I'm so glad. You know... I missed you so much since last time. I feel the same, but I'm so busy at work. I could see you everyday though. I wish, but it's impossible right now. Why? Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I have regular photo shootings. I see. Well, if you have to work... Goodness... It would be so great if every day was like this. You'll see, we'll live together one day. I'll work hard, just to be with you. Takuji. Undress me. What's wrong? Nothing. Tell me what's wrong! Why is life so unfair? What do you mean? I'm in a serious bind now. What a wonderful dream it would be... to built a life for you and me. I bought shares from a client and I lost money. What? I have to repay my debt very soon... or I'll be finished. I have to find 1,000,000 yen in two weeks. I can't. 1,000,000 yen in two weeks? Of course that's impossible. That will be the end of me. 1,000,000 yen. It's OK, I didn't want to worry you with this. I'll find a way. What? But I don't have that much money available. I know, it's a huge amount. Two weeks you said. And you'd be out of trouble? What? 1,000,000 yen? What did you get into? My brother caused an accident. He has to pay 1,000,000 yen. - Surely his car is insured. - Huh? I don't know about his insurance. I'm just repeating what he said. You told me you were an only child. When did I say such a thing? The first time I met you. You forgot? Right. It's possible I said that to gain your sympathy, Papa. But I do have a brother... I'm sorry. What is the truth now? Anyway, I can't pay. You know, I spend so much on you lately. I certainly can't pay 1,000,000 yen on top of that. Would that be for a lover? Come on, Papa! Don't be mean! Well, this whole story is so fishy. I get it. If that's what you think, I don't want to bother you. And my brother isn't as important as you, Papa. Hey, listen. You can't come to the company as you please. I'm sorry. I have to find 1,000,000 yen in two weeks. Of course that's impossible. That will be the end of me. That man who was with me... Please don't mention him to my husband. It's you? Welcome. I'm sorry about last time. Please. - Are you alone? - Yes. Thank you. Please. Listen... Today it's my turn to ask for a favor. Yesterday you came to me. You said nothing was going on with that man. Right. Before I moved into this mansion... I saw you in his arms many times. I'm sorry. Look over there, please. You see that tiny apartment? I was living there. I was watching you with binoculars. Madam, are you alright? Madam! Madam! Please pull yourself together! Madam, are you alright? Madam! So, what do you want? I promised you I wouldn't tell your husband. But I'm in a fix and I need your help in return. What do you need? Please, lend me money. You can trust me. I'm good for it! I promise I'll pay you back. How much do you need? 1,000,000 yen, if that is possible. 1,000,000 yen? I'm sorry. For a rich household like yours it's not that... But I can't ask that much from my husband. Please, I need your help. If you can wait... I can manage in 2-3 days. Hey, sorry you had to wait. It's been such a long time. I so glad to see you again, Chie-san. Please. Last time was at your wedding, I think. Yes, you're right. To what do we owe the pleasure to see you today? Well... The truth is, I'd like to borrow money. You're married into Morikawa Banking, so that's a surprising request. I have a pressing concern that I can't share with my husband. I see. How much do you need? I need 1,000,000 yen. 1,000,000 yen? Well, since you chose to trust me... I'll see what I can do. - You'd do that? - Sure. Of course, I don't have that much here. You're so kind! This is such a relief. Tonight at 7, come to the Sakusen Restaurant in Shibuya. - I'll give it to you there. - Yes. Sakusen Restaurant Excuse me, sir. You have a guest. Hey. Hey. Please, come. Surely, you'll have a cup? Thank you. When you were the prima donna of that ballet troupe... I was a great fan of yours. And I must admit... when you got married, that was quite a shock. I remember how kind you were to me then. Thank you. I was hoping I'd have my chance one day. Chie-san. - Let me go. - Come on. I never had my chance back then. You always asked for help and I got nothing in return. I can't do that! I can't! I brought the money as promised. Do you want it? Chie-san... But we agreed on 1,000,000 yen. I did my best to find these 500,000. I proved my sincerity. If you don't like it, leave it here. You're the one scheming behind your husband's back. I'd be in a good position to blackmail you now. I could only find half the amount. Only half? What should I do? Please don't ask me for more. Please don't insist. I'm not insisting or pressuring you. But how should I manage that other half? I'm at my wits' end. How about your lover? He's just a poor ballet dancer. He's broke. There's nothing I can do anymore. Please, help me. Please don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Spying on me with a telescope? But I'm sorry I can't comply with your request. You don't mind if your wife knows? Unfortunately, I'm not married. I'm enjoying an old bachelor's life. But you're a director! What if your staff knew? Think about your status. Sorry, that affair is an open secret. This company is in a particular line of business. A young lady like yourself... resorting to blackmailing is probably in a very tight position. If you need money that bad, I think I can help. You can earn enough with your body. What... do you mean? Not everyone can make money with their body. Wait... Hey, Mr. Kurihara. It's Tsuda. I found just the type of lady you're looking for. Right. Sure. I don't think she will be reticent at all. Alright, let's meet up. But... Mr. Director. Mr. Director. We share the same hobby. When he introduces me a nice lady, I pay him handsomely. You see? Mr. Director. About the money... I told you I'm at my wit's end. I'm not asking you to come up with more... but you have a way to earn it. How would I earn more? You promised you'd help me... and I won't talk. But... It's alright! It's nothing bad! You can do it. You promised you'd help me. Anyway, if I don't do it... you'll talk to my husband, right? It's all there. Thank you. I'm forever indebted to you. It's my manager. He can't see you here. Hello, I'm the plumber of the building. There's a leak on the 8th floor. Could I check the pipes in your apartment? Please. Good. Thank you, I took great photos. For you. Photographer is a tough job. It's hard to find the right shot. Sometimes it take a week or two. - I see. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Goodbye. Memories of love... Washed away with the waves Alright. I took these from my place. Please have a good look. Hey, but this is... You see, I can't stand cheating women. I just wanted you to know. Goodbye. You did it? Pale as a corpse. He was shaking. Thank you. I wish I'd seen his face myself. I don't need a whore like you. Papa, you can't leave me! It was just a fling! I won't see him anymore! Please! But you say he's your childhood boyfriend. Such a bond can't be cut off so easily. I will cut it off, I promise! You know how badly I want my mansion. Papa, you've always been so good to me. I'm begging you! Please! So you've decided to break up? You bet! It's over! I will stay here, even without your support! Oh? You'll find a luxury club? I have another job. It earns even more than a club! She wants to keep that scheme running. What do you think? I don't know. Hello, it's Tsuta. Hello, Mr. Kurihara. That lady would like to pursue our collaboration. What do you think? Right. Right. I see. I got it. He gets bored easily. He wants the best value for his money. He's always after new women. I'm sorry about that. Takuji! Takuji! Mr. Okawa moved out yesterday! What? He moved out? Yes, he moved to a mansion. He won at the lottery. That's what his wife told me. His wife? Hello. Mr. Okawa from management please. What? He quit? Hello! Are you sure he quit? M-A-N-S-I-O-N THE END
