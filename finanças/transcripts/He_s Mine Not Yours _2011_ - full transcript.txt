Seems like everywhere you look, love is all around. But make sure you look very closely because true love is nearly impossible to find. You doing all right, sir? Yes, I'm fine. In fact, how you doing? Excuse me? What's your name, beautiful? Uh, sorry. Now see, that's just wrong. Hey, we can't all be lucky enough to find Mr. right. True. Take a look at coming through the door. Ooh, mm. Now that's what I'm talking about right there. Woo, mm. Is he looking at me? He probably is, to tell you the truth. Do you know of him? Actually, I do. You know, I have never met a couple as fascinating as Chante and Harper, college sweethearts who broke up after college but then got back together, as fate would have it. As a matter of fact, tonight is the anniversary of their second first kiss. Oh, that is so romantic. Let's just say that Harper's romantic side is definitely going to cause a scene tonight. How exactly do you know them? It's my job. Let's just say I help women find true love. So you're one of those matchmakers. Not exactly. I'm a little more hands on than that. I help women find out if their guy is a Prince Charming or just another toad. Well, I'd say you definitely helped her out. What's that? Confirmation of whether Harper's a prince or a pretender. Hey, Jennifer, can you run that to table two for me, sweetie? Thanks. I gotta go. Here's my card. Call me if you ever need my services. Nice to meet you. What is that? Oh. Thank you. Another one? It's not from me. What? What's wrong? Oh, shit. All right. Let's do this. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Uh, whew, I just... I just want you to know that if I... if I don't make it out in one piece, I love you. You know, you say this to me every time that we do this. And I just keep thinking to myself, wow, you're stupid. You're stupid. OK? Can we go in and do our job, please? Wow. Excuse me. Excuse me. Coming through, coming through. What's up, man? Hey, young, got an ID? You look young. You seen him? Hold it. Chris Brown. Hey, candy girl. Hey, Kent. Long time no see. Where you been? Oh, just trying to stay on the truck. Mm. I see. Well, if you decide you want to get into some, you know where you can find me. Mm-mm-mm. Kent. Huh? Kent. Yeah. Why you still standing here? Waiting for the clock. Come here. Come here. OK. Who... who... who are you right now? Dude, we're still on the clock. Dude, whatever happened to what they don't know don't hurt them philosophy? Come on, man. I'm just trying not to fall of the wagon, dude. You can't fall off the wagon, brah. OK, hell, let it run you over. You're not married, man. Come on. Well, that might change son. Y... you for... you serious? What you trying to say, B Pumper? Huh? What's up? What's up, baby? You... you throwing in the towel, huh? You waving the white flag? Stop it. Stop it. Kid, come on. Look, you... you don't know anything about monogamy, OK? You wouldn't know monogamy if... if your name was Adam and her's was Eve. Wow. Wow. Wow. And Brooke is not the one to be turning your card for. Oh. That's a sign. Oh, so sorry. I guess I don't know my own strength. But thanks. These things have been falling out all night. It must have been because of all the bouncing and jerking, I guess. So do you like what you see? Absolutely. Absolutely. Oh, no. Oh, man. Hold on. Is that a siren? There's... there's an emergency. There's a lady about to jump off a building. We gotta go. We gotta go. That's right. Exactly. Let her die. No. Look, what is your name? Uh-uh. No. That accent is sexy as all get... Come on, we gotta go. I know. I know. Get off of me. She's Australian, too. Kent, what are... what are... What are you doing, brah? What... dawg. Look, first of all, don't try to play a player, brah, OK? Because I see it. I see it in your eyes. You still go the itch. Yeah. Yeah. You still. No. My itching days are over, all right? Yeah, right. At least they gonna have to be if I'm gonna ask Brooke to marry me. Wow. You are serious. Yeah. I'm... I'm sorry. I don't even know what to say to you. I don't know if I should congratulate you or start making plans for your funeral. Doug, it's not the death penalty. No, it's life without the possibility of parole ever. Man, is Brooke that bad, man? OK, OK, OK, OK. Look, don't... don't get me wrong, OK? I like... I like Brooke. But you gotta ask yourself two very important questions, all right? One is, do you really want to marry somebody that doesn't trust you at all? And two, my brother, more importantly, are you ready to give up all the power? Wow. Thank you. How you doing? - Wow. - You feel me? Really? Yeah, it's like that. No one man should have all that power? No, not at all. Wow. You know what? I'm gonna be in the truck. I'm gonna let you do your thing. All right. It's all good. What's up, ladies? How you doing? Ooh, ooh, ooh. Someone's feeling frisky tonight. Yes, I am. Mm. Does work have my baby stressed out? Mm, yes it does. Will you make me feel better? Mm-hmm. Mm. Ouch. Oh. Eeh. Oh, I'm sorry, baby. Damn. It's OK, baby. You women and your bra malfunctions today. Mm. And what does that mean? Uh, no... nothing. Actually, it's... it's a really funny story. See, I was at work... At work. Today. And... yeah. And this go-go dancer... She was dancing. A go-go dancer. And had a tassel hit me in the face. In the face. And... when she lifted up her blouse. And see, it was a freak accident. A freak is what it was. No. No. She... she was a freak. She was a freak. But it was a freak accident. It was not an accident. I'm doubting, ladies' man. Oh, no. Reformed ladies' man. The jury's still out on that one. Oh come on, baby. It... it was nothing. Hmm. I was at work. If you don't believe me, ask Doug. Doug is not a great character witness, Kent. Come on, baby. I... I don't wanna fight. I'm sorry. It's not you. I'm just... ugh, I feel so wound up, you know? I mean, tomorrow's only the biggest interview of my career. Come on. You acting like you're not the best candidate for the promotion. I mean, I could be the first female marketing director in the history of our company. I mean, that's huge. I know. If I could just... ugh, if I could just get a read on Mr. Godfrey. Yeah, what's up with that guy? I don't know. But I've never not been able to impress one of my bosses, and I'm not going to start now. That's right. Yeah. That's my baby. Mm. Mm. You're my biggest supporter, you know that? Mm-hmm. I love you. I love you, too. You stay here. OK. What's going on? What you doing? Hopefully something you like. What? You know, you spend all your time at those nasty clubs. Uh-huh. And you got your own woman right here, right? Yeah, you about to get nasty? Yeah? That's right. OK. Play some music. Let me put something on for you to dance to. Wait a minute. OK. No way, baby. No, no, no, no. That's it, baby. That's that primary bass. No, no, no, no. I want something sexy and really... Sexy? OK. Slow jams, slow jams. I like that one. That's it? Yeah. Yeah? Mm-hmm. k We'll make it official. I'm gonna make it rain. Yeah. It's magic city time. Yeah, this is gonna make it rain. Get it. I can't see. Make it rain. I can't see. Oh. Oh! Baby! Oh, damn. Baby, are you OK? I'm so sorry. I... I... just thought you would like it. Why do you even have all those singles? I... I thought you would like that. Sorry, I'm just not a professional like the ones you're used to making it rain on. No. No, no, no, no. Don't... don't leave, baby. What are you doing? Come on, now. No. No, don't be embarrassed. I need... I need to go. No, it happens to the best of them, baby. Baby, don't leave. No, what are you doing? Stop. Baby, finish your dance. Don't be embarrassed, OK? It happens to the best of them. Strawberry at the club... she was twerking it out one time. She fell back, hit her head on stage. It happens to the professionals, baby. It happens all the time. Just don't go. Please. Baby, I'm not a professional. So I don't... I just... I just need to go. No, no, no. But understand this. I don't care. You don't have to do that, OK? That's not why I'm with you. All right? It... it doesn't change the way I feel about you. Please, don't leave. You're kind of awesome. You know that? You're awesome too. I love you. Don't leave, OK? I love you. OK. Mm, I'm so tempted. But I gotta go. I do. I need to focus for tomorrow. I'm sorry. What? Rain check? Rain check? Come on, cheerleader. I'm cheering. I'm cheering. I love you. I love you, too. Damn. Woo. Great shot, sir. Thank you. Good to see you, Mr. Godfrey. Good to see you. This here's for you. What is this? Come on. I already know your work. I don't need to see that. I know you're brilliant. Thank you, sir. But to be the director of marketing requires more than brilliance. Yes, it takes someone who is completely organized, highly knowledgeable, and in complete control. And someone who's willing to listen just as much as they're willing to talk, someone who's flexible. Yes. Someone who has a willingness to learn, and someone who's open for suggestions. Am I right? Yes, sir. Definitely. Listen, Brooke. k What we're trying to do this year is tap into the young market. Oh. So we need someone who resonates with these younger clients we're trying to bring in, someone who, uh, thinks outside of the box. Well, I, sir, can definitely think outside of the box. I assure you that. You can? Yes, sir. Well, let's just see. If you make this putt, you get the job. Can't we just... just do the interview, please? It's just a putt, Brooke. Sir, I don't think that my getting this promotion should be based on me making that putt. It should definitely be based on my abilities. Really? Yes, sir. You can't do it, can you? I didn't say can't. All right. Thank you. Take your time. Most definitely. Let me get my shot lined up. Now see, one great putt, one great marketing director coming up. Great. All right. So let me get this right. You putted for your promotion, babe? I had to. You know how bad I want that job. What? You know what a move up like that would mean for me? For us. So he challenged you. Yes, he challenged me. Ugh. All right. What happened next? Well, after embarrassing myself... OK, he tells me that he knows me well enough to know that I wasn't going to back down from a challenge, right? So then he says, I'll give you a second chance with this new product launch. Sounds kind of interesting. What... what kind of product? A clothing line they want to target after a younger audience. So my mission is to think out of the box, whatever that is. You know what you should do? What? You should do a throw back function. You know, like... like these old school parties. You know what I'm saying? I think people would really like that. That's what you think? Yeah. That's a cute idea, and you're cute. But I don't think that'll work. I don't wanna bore the kids. You know what I mean? I wanna attract them, not bore them to death. But I love you. All right. Cool. Oh, I gotta go. But listen, I took the liberty of booking us reservations at Le Bistro to celebrate later on, OK? OK. What are we celebrating? I didn't get the promotion. Well, no. We're gonna celebrate. We're gonna celebrate, um, you and me. Aw, there you go with that sweet thing again. Give me cheek. Give me cheek. Mm-hmm. Mm, I hate seeing you go. I know. But I got to. I love you. I love you, too. All right. Whipped cream tonight. That's what we're doing. I hope you're ready. Did you enjoy dinner? Yeah, tonight was a good idea. Thank you. I needed that. Celebrating us was a good idea. I appreciate that. Mm-hmm. That dress is off the chain. Thank you. You look good, baby. Thank you. No, you look good though. Mm-hmm. I love you. Kent. Kenton Hughes, is that you? It's me, Kim. Uh. Oh, yeah. Kim. Kim. Yeah, uh, how you doing? Good. It's been a long time since I've seen you. And we... it's been a long time. Yeah, yeah. Whew. Hey, Brooke. Brooke, this is Kim. How nice. Kim, this is my girlfriend Brooke. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Wow. It's been a while. Yes, yes. Don't act like you don't know Kent and Kim. Kent and Kim. Like an after school cartoon or something. That's cute. It was the Kent and Kimmy show. Kent and Kimmy. That's so cute. Cute, Kim, and Kent. Good, good, good. Good, well, it was... Are you chipping in on the bill or anything? I mean, you sat down like you were offering. Uh, she... no. She's a comedian. Yeah, she... she is. We just doing our thing. It's all right. You know what? I'm not going to interrupt the romantic evening you guys are having. Thank you, thank you. But it was good seeing you, Kenton. Yup, it was good seeing you too. Have a good evening. Bye. Nice meeting you, Brandy. Brooke, Brooke. Her name's... Your butt's falling out. - Stop. - It is. I mean... Don't do that. It's fine. Clearly, she's from the skanky area of your past. Why? Why? No, just chill out. Just relax. Why do you have to be so... That was rude. She sat at our table. Hi. Hey. Flowers for the lady. Flowers for the lady. Thank you. Good save. I love orchids. Me too. I wish my man was half as romantic as yours. Oh, sweetie, is something in your eye? Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You might wanna get something for that. Check please. I guess we'll just wrap everything up here. We'll take the check please. Yeah. No problem. Look, I'm... I'm sorry, babe. To... tonight wasn't supposed to go like that. Don't worry about it, baby. It's OK. I... I didn't know she was gonna be coming through with that ass and... and... Whoa, with the what? Not the ass. With no class. It was... it was... it was totally just... I don't know what to... I got to get out of here, like, ooh gosh. I'm ready to go. Can you... can you... And your check. You gonna pay? No, I am not going to pay. No, I'll take... Oh, I just... I'll take care of it. She looks so strong. She's strong. No, no she is. That I am. That I am. Everything's inside. Drop that on the table. Wheel it back a bit. Thank you. I'll be over here if you need me. OK. Bye. Thank you. OK, OK, OK. Goodbye to you and your butt. Time to go. Can you just stop? Can you help me work out this gratuity please? No, I will not. You good with the math. You... you do that. Use your brain on that instead of thinking about... Use my brain? No. - Now is not the time. - Your mind is everywhere. Now is not the time, Kent. Just put it... oh, god. All right. Ooh, you know what we could do? We could do high mimosas, not high tea. Mimosas? Yes. You always want a cocktail. No, honey. Today we are having tea and crumpets. OK. Romantic restaurant, your favorite flowers, and dessert on a silver platter? Hello, honey. Sounds to me like you just ruined a perfect proposal. I didn't ruin it. Those girls ruined it. But Brooke, you don't have anything to worry about. I mean, if Kent is as perfect as you say he is, he'll propose again. I'm not worried, Danielle. Yeah. No one ever is, Brooky. I mean, look at me. I never would have believed it about Tony or Lloyd or Clarence. Oh, my gosh. Or Mario. What? Nothing. Well, I don't have to worry, because Kent is reformed. Ugh, face reality, Brooke. All men cheat. Uh-uh. Wait, hold up, honey. All men do not cheat. They don't. OK? And I think Kent is one who doesn't. Thank you. Well, I mean, at least I don't think so. Oh, well, thank you. Come on. It's the truth. Well, there's one way that you can know for sure. You could give him the MS test. And what is that? Why do you think that I am still single? Well, there's a lot of reasons. I mean, it could be because you're a little bit of a picky bitch, but... Stop it, OK? We're going to be nice today. No, Brooke. It's because all my men have failed the MS test. Like multiple sclerosis? I'm not understanding. Keep it up. Keep it up. Girl, I don't like ugly. Get to the MS test please. What is it? It's not what. It's who. She's called the man stealer. And she is one woman you do not want anywhere near your man if you want to keep him, that is. Now, none of her clients have ever seen her in person. But I'm willing to guess that she's got the body of a Victoria's Secret model and the face of a goddess. You know, wherever she goes, men lose their freaking minds. You know Stacy Shaw? Mm. She said her ex certainly lost his. And apparently, a lot of men fall for her because her website boasts a 99% success rate. It bring out the inner Fido in all men. You know the 1%? Yeah, they're probably gay. But whatever she looks like, one thing's for certain. Only men with true love in their hearts can pass the MS test. Well, in that case, Kent would ace the test. Well, there's only one way to find out. Are you challenging my love, my four year relationship? Brooke, careful. Careful. Don't go looking for trouble, OK? Because people that go looking for trouble... They normally find it. To the perfect couple. That would be me and William. To the perfect couple. Here's to you and Kent. Thank you. Cheers. What do we have here? What are we celebrating, ladies? Uh, OK. I see what this is. Y'all must be talking about men, huh? You know it. In that case, um, let me excuse myself. Wait, wait. Not so fast, brother-in-law. You know, maybe you can help us out. All right. What, what, what? Lay it on me. Brooke. All right, William. This is about Kent. And we want to know if you think all men cheat. Well, that's an interesting question. Yes, it is. Mm-hmm. I think they got a show called "Cheaters." It might give you some insight. Answer the question. Well, well, since you guys are going to just drag me all up in this mess, I mean, Kent seems like a cool dude, you know? But, uh, you know what they say. Once a player, always a player. Preach. Watch it. On that note, deuces. No. Trust. Never. I got things to do. OK. Nope. Just walk away. OK. It won't hurt. OK. You're not going to do this. Nope. I'm better than that. I am so much better than that. Well, that... that concludes our tour. And, uh, like I said before, here at the African-American museum at Station Number 30, we are dedicated to preserving the legacy of African-Americans in the fire service. And with that, thank you for coming out. Thank you. It's really cool that you guys have this place. To tell you the truth, I never even knew it was here. Do you guys work here full time or... Oh, no, uh, Doug and I are actual LA firefighters. But, uh, we just come here from time to time, you know, to volunteer, give back. Great. Yeah. Appreciate it. Hey, man, I appreciate you. Thanks for coming out. No worries. Nice to meet you. All right. Cool. Take it easy. You too. A real American hero in the flesh. Just like GI Joe. Well, Joe, it looks like your friend here needs a little help. Doug? Y... yes? Yes? I didn't know we were doing safety training today. Well, Kent, you... You know me, right? I mean, you can never put in too much overtime. I mean, you know, you can never be too safe. Oh, and I don't mind. I like seeing you handsome black men working hard. You know what? Let's... let's go this way. It was nice meeting you. All right. Well, hey, take care of that thing I told you about. Right. Yeah. Yeah, I pretty much run this place, you know. Yeah, I mean, you know, without me, this would fall apart. Kent's like my little sister. Oh, so you working hard and in charge, huh? I like that too. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't I show you some other, you know... I'd love to see whatever you have. After you. So where'd you say you were from again? Um, well, just like down the street. He's pretty funny and quite the ladies' man. You have no idea. So what can I do for you, Ms. Photographer? I'm looking for Kenton Hughes. Oh. That's me. I'm Kenton Hughes. You're Kenton Hughes? Yeah. You're the reason why I'm here. I work for the "Daily Breeze," and we're doing a segment on local profiles. And Kenton Hughes made the cut. Damn. I guess I was drawn to you. Uh, what do we have to do for this profile? Basically, I need to follow you around at work and play and everything in between. Is that all? Yes. Oh, and I'm on a really tight deadline, so we should get started ASAP. How about tomorrow? Uh, tomorrow? That's good. You know what? The sooner we finish this, the better. Yeah. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. Damn. Woo. You only smile like this when you're about to drop the hammer on another chump. Not true. I smile at a lot of things. Uh-huh. So who's the unlucky toad tonight? This guy, likes brunettes, frequents gentleman's clubs, loves Italian food. Ah. And, uh, where might I be meeting you? Spaghettini's. And don't be late this time. Hey, don't worry. Me and my camera will be laying in wait, reading to catch the next idiot in the act. They man not all be idiots. Mr. Kent didn't respond like the others. I've never heard you say that. I know. Game on. I'm saying, why are you acting all nervous though? No, dude, every time, like, we go out... thank you, sir. Every time we go out, you always gotta bring me into an environment where there's, like, a lot of estrogen, like a lot of chicks. Like, how come we just can't go to an environment where there's an even mixture? It is. It's just... Why would you even want that? Because I... look, that doesn't even matter. It makes no sense at all. I just need you to be my anchor today, OK? Don't even trip, homie. I got your back, homie. I'm serious, Doug. All right. I got you, man. I got you. All right? Relax. You're all nervous. I... yeah. Hold on. This is Brooke. That's why I'm nervous. Hello? Hey, sweetie. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. Oh, I didn't tell you I was having lunch with Doug? Yeah. We're having lunch with that photographer too. No. Is she pretty? Hell yea, she's... No, no. She... she all right. I mean, you know, whatever. But you ain't got nothing to worry about. Yeah. I know. OK. Well, I'll... I'll see you later on. All right. I love you, too, baby. Bye, baby. I'm terrible. I cannot believe I let you talk me into this. Oh, come on. This is the only way you'll ever know the true Kent. Was that the warden? No, man. It was your mother. You know, me and her have been hanging out a lot lately. You know, I never knew she was a freak like that. Your mother's special. Wow. That's right. That's right. That's right. I'm playing. Look, I... I just need you to just sit here and have lunch with us and be cool. I will Dude, I already told you. I got you, all right? I mean, but personally, I don't... I don't even understand why I'm here. I mean... I mean, to be honest with you, I certainly wouldn't invite you to be a third wheel if I was having lunch with, like, Miss December or somebody, you know. I mean, not unless, you know, she wanted it that way. Does... does she... does she want it that way? Did you ask her? I'm... I'm saying, like, you know, she... she wants... Hey, Kent. Hey, Doug. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I interrupt something here? No. No, not at all. Absolutely not. As a matter of fact, I was just telling Kent I am really sorry I will not be able to join you two for lunch today. Yes. Yeah. Booty... duty calls. You got that, right? All right then. Uh. What a jerk off. So what's up? How you doing? Oh, I'm good. I'm good. I'm glad you could come out. You're... you're out. Absolutely. You're really... And thank you for having me. No problem. Gotta love Doug. He's so dedicated to the job. I get the feeling you are just as dedicated. I'm sorry. Would you like something to drink? Coffee, tea, water, maybe some wine? Take the edge off. Hey, what, you trying to get me drunk already? No, it's OK. I never drink when I'm on the job. I'll take a water. Speaking of job, why'd you become a firefighter? Oh, to rescue, uh, damsels in distress. Oh. Thank you. No, I'm just kidding. It's a little firehouse humor. I... I guess I just wanted to help people. Oh. So how long have you been rescuing damsels? All my life. No, no, uh, I've been on the force for about eight years now, eight proud years. They look really cozy together, don't they? Ooh, I wonder what they're saying. I wonder what they're saying. You're too happy for this. Mm-hmm. Well, you know there's only one way we're going to find out. What? What are you doing? Well, I'm going to see if Mr. Wonderful's as perfect as you say he is. He is, Danielle. Are you always this charming? Let me get another one of these. Excuse us. Excuse me. Ooh, duck. Duck. And here you've got candles, some lingerie, you know? You work that out, girl.. Danielle, this is silly. If we just get a little closer, we can hear their conversation. Please. All right. Look, I just wanna see who this woman is. Come on. Sorry. So the hours are grueling, huh? Gosh, it must be hard for your... girlfriend? The readers want to know. Trust me. It makes for a better profile. Oh. In that case, uh, yeah, I guess it's kind of tough on her. I have to spend a lot of time away from her. Brooke. That's her name. Brooke. Oh, he said your name. He said your name. Aren't you interested in jotting all this juicy info down? Oh, honey, trust me. I've got a mental file like a steel trap. So it's, uh, tough for Brooke. Keep going. Um, yeah. It's kind of tough on her. I mean, um, matter of fact, we were supposed to have lunch together today. Oh, no. Did I get you in trouble or anything. Or... No. No, no. OK. It's OK. Brooke is cool. See? We gotta go. Oh, gosh. Let's go, please. Right. Oh, wait, wait, wait. No, we haven't seen her face yet. I'm gonna get busted. Let's go, Danielle. All right. God. I am so... I'm so sorry, ma'am. Let me help you clean that up. Can we get a wet nap over here? I'm so sorry... that was my bad. It was... I'm sorry. Let me get that for you. Pray. Can we get a napkin or something? That's crazy. I know. Wow. Wet nap? What kind of restaurant y'all running? You guys work hard. What do you do for fun? Brick. Look at this no game-having... Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on. I hear you talking. You can talk a good game. Can actually play it? You don't want none of this. You don't want none of this. That's my assistant, Natalie, over there. She's going to get some shots while I school y'all. Oh, and get a shot of Jordan. This is baby Jordan. Boo-ya. Make or take it. In your face. You OK? I just wanna make sure you're cool. Yo, yo, put your hand in her face or something. I ain't gonna put my hand in her face, man. She don't even know how to play the game. Hey, kid, right here. We right here. I'm looking at you. I'm gonna teach you a thing or two. What? Hey. Yo. Two to zip. You disappoint me, kid. Come on. No, I'm gonna go ahead and play now. It's embarrassing, OK? Oh, thank you. See, now we talking. Now we talking. Let me get my LeBron on, man. What's wrong with you? OK. All right. Take a picture of that. I let you have that. You got that? My D got you on lock. Now, you said your Ds. Your... your D? Oh, all right. Whatever. Play the game. Play the game. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Focus. Oh. Oh. I said, take it to the right. All right. All right. Take it to the right. Can you? Or you gonna fake? That's classic AC. Oh, OK. Nice. That's game. Let me take you to school and show you something. You and all your subliminal comments. Man. You didn't tell me you were a hooper. Hey, I tried to warn you. I grew up as a tomboy, so... I have two older brothers who love basketball. I didn't have a choice. Huh. So how'd you go from being Candace Parker to being Beyonce? I know your brothers weren't really feeling that. I guess I sort of grew out of it. Or more specifically, I grew these. I had a girlfriend who convinced me to try out for cheer-leading. So I traded in my kicks for pom-poms. I never really liked cheerleaders. No? Why not? Were you nice to Mr. Most Likely to Succeed? Yes. No. Yeah, that's what I thought. The only time y'all nice to me is if you needed help with your homework. Plus, you know, light-skinned brothers was in back then. Oh, what are you talking about? Come on. You know what I'm talking about. That's all y'all wanted, Mr. Al Beat, Mr. Cool J. Yeah. Dark-skinned brothers weren't even in the rotation then. OK. I'll give you that. I'll give you that. But that was then, you know. This is now. So what do they say? Like, the darker the berry, the sweeter the juice. Is that how it goes? Oh, damn. I'm on fire. I mean, something's on fire. You know what? Another time, another place. So many things. But I can't, all right? I... I gotta go. Oh, my god. Your leg's so soft. Oh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, I gotta go. That's a first. Yeah. It's gonna take a little more effort than I thought. Yo, hurry up, hot lips. Leave it alone, D. What, man? She looked like she was trying to get traded to your team, and you weren't trying to stop her. Man, I wasn't gonna kiss her. Right. I wasn't. Stop saying that. Right, right. So? So what? Uh, look, don't make me cut you, Miss MS Test. OK? I understand you two had quite the undercover operation yesterday? Mm-hmm. She was hilarious. You should've seen her, with cake all on her face. Shh. You didn't. Keep it down. He's in the other room. It wasn't that funny. I can't even believe I'm doing this. This is ridiculous. Oh, please. It is not ridiculous. And you know what? We're gonna find out soon enough. Mm-hmm. I know that's right. You know what? Maybe I should try the man stealer test. For what? Exactly. You know. So she can rub more of how perfect everything is in our face. I mean, come on now. You know he's perfect. - He's not perfect. - We know. Your man, your boo. No, what does she call him? Her chocolate hive. Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what she calls him? What? Mr. Always Right. No, seriously, if Kent was as perfect as William is, I'd be pregnant, knocked up, happy, all those good things. So let's hope he passes this past. Yeah, the whole situation was crazy, right? I mean, Tiger was a freak. He had stripper after stripper coming out, porn stars. Bang, bang, bang, bang. Man. Yeah, man. It's like your man said in that flick, ain't nothing better than a woman. So the new woman. Oh. Yeah, man. You know, I bet you know all about that. I bet you they be throwing it at you like you skinny Luther or something. No, no. I'm cool, man. I'm trying to stay on the straight and narrow, do the husband and wife thing like you. You know what I'm saying? Look, but don't touch, right? Yeah, man. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, baby. Hey. That looks good. You know it does. Mm. You all right? What? He's a great role model, isn't he? All right. So I didn't put a lot of cheese because we're staying the night. Oh. Oh, cool, thanks. I don't like a lot of cheese. It's a little Frisbee, huh? All right. This is my forte. I see. You gonna show me what you got? You like games? I love games. I play them all the time. Oh, I bet. All right. You just gotta stay focused, nice and easy. Oh. Beautiful. Let's see. Wow. All right. OK. Oh, God. Oh, wow. That's... do the second one. OK. That happens. It happens. All right. Let me show you. OK. Grab it right there. Mm-hmm. Good. Back up into it. Yeah, don't be shy. OK. Oh, yeah. You know what? I need to freshen up a bit. Where is the little girls' room? Um, just over there. That way? Yeah. OK, great. Hold that for me, sweetie. OK. You be back now. OK. Whew. Yo, yo. Hey, babe. No, no, no. That's the TV. Mm-hmm. Yeah. All right. I'll see you. I love you too. Mm-mm-mm, you dog. I hope you're ready because this guy's a loser. Oh, just like the rest. I don't know. Kent seems to be different. Mandy. What? Do you like Kent? Hell no. He's just different. Uh-huh. Be careful, Mandy. Don't get involved. Hey, it's 99% success, not 100%. Just let this one go. OK. I'm already planning on calling his girlfriend and telling her we're off the case. All right. Now let's go save another girl from heartache because this wig and these heels... child, please. Woo. All right. Let's go. OK. Don't forget to show me that ring, girl. You know, I never meet clients here. But in your case, I thought it was necessary. You? You're the man stealer. Yup. And I've got a 99% success rate to prove it. The reason why I called you here is because I think Kent could go in the other 1%. So I'm pretty much done. Oh. Wait, you're done? Yup. Something wrong? Uh, well, yeah. I, uh, paid you for a service. And it's only been a few days. I thought you'd be happy. Isn't this what you wanted? No, it is. Trust me, it is. It's just I really need to know for sure. I... I need you to do a full investigation. You don't know Kent, OK? He hasn't always been squeaky clean. So I just really want to make sure that he's changed, truly changed into this, uh, 1% that you speak of. And, um, don't take this the wrong way. But you don't strike me as the kind of girl that he would actually really be into. OK, Brooke. Let me help you out here, OK? Go back to your man and be thankful for who he is because as wonderful as you as think you are compared to me, you're not unlike many of my clients who let a good man slip through their pretty little fingers. Listen, whatever your name is. It's Mandy. Oh, Mandy? Hmm. Listen, Mandy. I don't know who you think you are. But Kent, my man... he has a great taste in women. And you are far from perfect. You're right, Brooke. I'm not perfect. But what a man like Kent sees in me is pretty damn close. Ha. Yeah, you don't know him. You're right. I don't. But what I do know is that if you keep testing him, he will end up like the other 99%. Is that a threat? I'm just saying, you have a good man. Start appreciating him before he gets taken. Listen, honey, I take men from their women every day. It's my job. But Kent... Kent, I just might take for myself. So listen, walk away from this. Huh. I never walk away from anything. OK. If this is what you want, I will gladly take your man. Gladly? Well, then I guess it's on. Hmm. Well, I guess so. We should keep this between us. Not a problem. We're done. We're done when I say we're done. Oh. I'll win. Music, huh? Likes neo soul, basketball. Favorite body part, legs. Thank you, fellas, for letting me tag along. I really got some good information. Oh, it's no problem. It's all good because you brought us gifts. Stop. What is it with today's music? Hey, tell me about it. It's like you come up with a wack saying and add a dance to it, you can just get on the money boat. I know, right? All I need is some good neo soul. Give me some 'Gel, India, I'm good. Shut up. You don't know nothing about no neo soul. What? Girl, that ain't no cheerleader music. Oh, OK. Hold on, wait. We gonna test her. What you know about this? What? Oh, wait a minute. Oh, don't test the kid. Don't test the kid. Don't test the kid. I'm trying to tell y'all. All right. All right. I'm trying to tell y'all. I tell you, stay with the kid, you'll learn something. Oh, for real? Yeah, music soul job. Why you gonna go there though? Why you even gotta go there on me like that? Hold on, hold on. For real, for real. All right. All jokes aside, you might wanna hang back a little bit, for real, because she might not handle it. Because you know it can get dangerous inside. What he means by dangerous is we going into Southern Girl Desserts. Southern Girl Desserts? Ooh, that sounds good. Yeah, you never had it? No. It's off the chain. Come on. Hold up, hold up. Ladies first, man. I got the door. Just chill. Hey, there's my boys. Where y'all been? I take it y'all are regulars. Uh, something like that. Oh, honey, these are my boys. You know, they can't get enough of these cupcakes. Boy, wash your hands. Actually, I think it's just their excuse to come by and see me. What? Are we that obvious? Some feelings, you just can't hide. Come on, baby. Come on. Get back. Get back. Take a deep breath. Are you OK? Just calm down. It's OK. Thank you so much. It's no problem. Get some water. It's OK. Good work. Good work, baby boy. Good work. Yo, let's, uh... Let's keep this here. You know what I'm saying? Between brothers. This stays here. You dig? Yeah, yeah. I got you. Ha ha, my dude. Baby boy. Take care. You need some air. You OK? She OK. She just needs some air. Come on. Come on. Let's get you some air. Take some deep breaths. Yeah. Yeah, man. Y'all come back, OK? Yeah. Take care. You see this? Wow. Saved the day. Hey. That's what we do. OK, Doug. Thanks for agreeing to meet me here. I think. Yo, to be honest with you, uh, I almost didn't show up. I didn't think you were serious. But then I thought to myself, hey, what kind of friend would I be not to make this sacrifice? Doug, I have never been more serious. Yeah, I see that. Kent told me. He said, Brooke would never set foot in a place like this. And here you are. Yeah. That's saying something. It is, isn't it? OK. Before we get all warm and fuzzy, OK, I'm here for my boy Kent. That's all. I'm just looking out for him. Of course. And I'm here for my man, Kent. So... OK. Well, yeah. There it is. All I need you to do is just tell me what to do. OK, well, first things first. Repeat after me. - OK. - Ready? Mm-hmm. Lighten. Lighten. The. The. Hell up! H... Lighten up. Lighten up. You know what I'm saying? Relax, exhale, put your shoulders down. They are down. No, they're not. Thank you. Yeah, loosen up. Do something unplanned, you know? Unexpected. Like what? You ever fart in front of Kent? See? No. You're boring. Yeah. I got it. Unlock your inner scripper. My inner what? Your inner scripper. Oh, yeah. I tried that. It... it didn't go too well. It's probably because you ain't do my man's favorite move. You know, he got this little move he like when... Kent has a favorite move? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Didn't he tell you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Baby... as a matter of fact, baby girl in the other room was doing it right before you came too. She was like like, bak, bak, bak. Yeah, it's called the red snapper. Well, if there's gonna be somebody freaky moving, it's gonna be this woman. So it's gonna be move. If anyone's gonna freaky move with Kent, it's gonna be me. Girl, what the hell are you doing? Give me the information. Come on now. Give me the scoop, brother. I'm down. Don't you want to sit down? No. Seriously, come on. OK. Cool. You come to the jungle. You play. That's right. That's right. So first, you want to limp to the side. OK. Kind of like your leg was broke. Oh, OK. That's... no, that's... that's what's I'm talking about right there. Yeah. And then you want to shake. OK. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, and kind of twitch, kind of like you smoking. OK. OK. Yeah, yeah. What? You're an ass. You are an ass. Ah. First you gotta limp to the side, kind of like your leg was broken. Yo, for real though, don't ever do that again, ever in life. Ha, ha. Of Can we help me now please? I'm serious. I... I need your help. All right. All right, Brooke. Look, you have to stop being so judgemental. You gotta cut that out. Stop it. All right? No man wants to be critiqued about he everything he does. I do that? OK. Next lesson, stop debating everything. Everything is not a debate, unless you trying to tell me that those are real. Don't no man... and I mean no man... want to be challenged about everything, everything, especially from his woman. Does Kent say that about me? Doug, what else does he say? Is he falling for Mandy? Doug, hello. What? Gosh, doesn't that get old? Hell no. How could it get old? So many. What I do know though, Brooke, is you were Kent's choice. All right? Now, I don't know. Oh, god. Uh, you've got to tell me what to do then. Well, specifically, Brooke, only you know that. What I do know though is you... you could do something to keep your man's full attention. I guess we're done. Uh, full attention, full attention. Second shot opportunity. Fisher! Ooh. Now, that's how you run a triangle offence. For real, triangles. Mm. What about yours? I don't know, D. I mean, I didn't know it was going to be this hard. You know? I really thought I was done. I figure I just put a ring on Brooke and be happy. But now... Now what? Oh. Oh, I see. You figure you take your talents to South Beach, huh? There you go. Man, it's serious. I don't know. What if meeting Mandy was a sign, showing me that Brooke's not the one? Man, shut your crying. You sound like a girl. Oh, is Mandy the one? Is Brooke? Who cares? They're both hot. Brooke hot. Mandy hot. You know? What's the... what's the problem? No, but it's not just about the physical thing? Well, what is it about? The metaphysical, huh? Yo, hey, I think you got company, my man. Hey. Brooke? Baby? I'm looking for my man. W... what are you doing? What are you doing dressed like this? What... what's going on? What? You don't like it? Yeah, Kent. You don't like it? No, no, no. I... I... I do. I do. But what are you trying to do? I'm trying to watch the game with you, sexy. Mind if I stay? Uh, um, I don't... I don't think... I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? I thought you wanted me to watch the game with you. No, I... I do. But you should... we should... we should just go back to... to my place and look at the game. Why? All of your friends are here. Yeah, um, we're all here. Hey, man. Hey, chill out, man. You ain't gonna be my friend for too much longer. No. No. Stop it. Come on. Let's get a coat. Hey, Doug. Doug, look after her, OK? You see this, what's going on with my baby? Absolutely. This is... I don't know what you're doing. I don't know what this is. Doug. Nice move. Oh, don't you worry. I've got plenty more. Ah, I'm sure you do, Brooke. Listen, are you sure you want to keep doing this because... Are you sure you want to keep doing this? Oh, absolutely. Yeah? Because I never lose ever. Good to know. OK. Oh, ho, woo. Hey. Hey, I see... I see you ladies have met. We did. You know, I was just telling Brooke how great our interviews were going. I'm getting such good stuff with you. Really? What kind of good stuff are you getting, you know, hanging around other women's men? Oh. It's funny you should ask. I think we should get going. I feel a cat fight cat coming on. Uh, Kent, you... you leaving? You guys are laving? Yeah. Yeah, Kent, you can't leave. The game is starting to get really good. Oh, really? Then baby, we have to stay. Hey, Brooke, you can sit right here, if you want. Hey, look here, partner, I... mm-mm. You see what I'm dealing with here with, man? Come on, man. You gotta help me get this under control. Uh, you gotta love they're trying. Oh, Doug, damn it. This is serious. I need your help, D. Come on, man. Look at that D, Kent. He's got the boy on lock. Oh, the playoffs are going to be bananas this year. What are you doing? Well, which one is Shaq? Huh, baby? I can't see him. Uh, uh, he's... he's not on the team, babe. Yeah, he got traded out, and the team is so much stronger without him. They just fit, don't you think, Kent? Yeah, well, they won championships with him. Right, baby? Yeah, but everyone knows that Kobe was they young star. They traded out the old model for something new and improved. Oh, well, everyone thought Kobe was Mr. Wonderful. Then he got caught with his pants down. True, he was accused. But the charges were dropped. Yeah. But he lost a lot behind that. Well, he still has the team. I guess when you get right down to it, he was just the better package. Oh. No, Brooke. Baby. You don't have to leave on my account, all right? I thought I was doing something that would make you happy. But clearly, I was wrong. No, it's... it's... It's not like that. It's always like that, Kent. Why is she even here? You invited me to come see the game with you. God, you think William would do this to my sister? Oh. You know what? Don't follow me. All right? You just stay your ass here. Aw. Oh, shit. Drive it to the hole! Penetrate! Ugh. The playoffs are gonna be good though. There's some good match ups. Yeah. Yeah, it looks like it. Wanna sit down? Yeah. That's cool. That was a good game, right? You see that three pointer at the buzzer? That was hot. Yeah. Definitely. Can I ask you a question? Yeah, sure. Is everything OK with you and Brooke? Off the record? Off the record. It could be better. Oh, gotcha. Brooke sure is a lucky girl. Somebody should tell her that. You don't think she knows? I think Brooke sees what she wants to see, and that's unfortunate. That's not a Brooke thing, Kent. That's a woman. Trust me. Yeah, I guess you're right. But, I... I just don't know what got into her today. I mean, wilding on me like that and then storming out? I... I just... I don't know. Well, speaking from experience, women just want to know that their Mr. Right is really who he says he is. I mean, the last thing you want to do is come home two nights before your wedding and find your man in the shower with your roommate. True story? Yeah. That guy's an idiot. Tell me about it. Most are. And maybe that's what us women are afraid of. But I haven't done anything. And I mean, I keep on getting tested, you know? I'm just beginning to wonder if it's even worth it anymore. Really. Well, call me sappy. I mean, even with all the craziness I've been through, I still believe in soul mates. What about you? I believe people mess things up all the time, but you can't... You can't hold it over somebody's head forever. You know what I mean? It's just too much... Pressure. Yeah. Yeah, I've... that pressure thing can be really tricky. It can make you think in ways and do things you wouldn't normally do but maybe you need to do. Have you ever felt like that? Yeah, but, uh, you should never act on those urges, right? No, you should. You just... you shouldn't fight it. Um. Look, uh, uh, I can't. I can't do this. I... I gotta go, OK? I gotta go. It's a shame. I mean, I shouldn't be this good. You know what I mean? I mean, come on, man, nothing but net, to the bottom of the net, with my eyes closed. Yo, Kent, what's up with you, man? You're right. What is wrong with me? I... I think Brooke's right, though. I... I don't see how she could trust me. What'd you do, K? What'd you do? Nothing. What'd you... don't... You dirty... you... No, your mind is in the gutter. You... you was here wit your... No, no, no, no, no. Yes, you did. Yes. Did you pound it like this? No, no, no. Hell no. Yes, you did. None of that. Hey, Doug, can you, um, give us a minute? Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. Stop. Stop. Stop it. He's an idiot. You already know that about him. That's just what he does. So, um, what's up with the cold shoulder? Nothing. I just... no cold shoulder. It's all right. Look, Kent, if this is about the other day, I'm sorry. I just... I got caught up in the moment. It didn't mean anything. Really? It didn't mean anything? No, of course not. We didn't do anything. Look, I have everything I need for the story. So let's call it a wrap. I'm taking you out tonight. We're celebrating. Oh, no, no, no. Let's just do a rain check on that. Nope. Not a chance. Geisha House, nine o'clock. Hot sake and a beer. And quickly, please, before I die of boredom. Sake, huh? I thought you didn't drink when you were on the job. Who said I'm on the job? Oh, no. They have karaoke tonight? You're in trouble. Hot sake, ma'am. Thank you. Nice. Enjoy. Oh, I will. And we're going to need two more of these. Two more? Ooh. Hmm, yes. No, no. Drink up. It's hot. You know that's like 100 degrees? Damn. Sure you don't want this? No, no no. I'm good. Appreciate it. Fine. Wow. You, uh... you really going in. Ah, that's some stuff. Ooh. Actually, make that four more. Oh, Jesus. Damn. That's like the seventh one. OK. Hey, be careful now. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Ladies and gentlemen, this next song is dedicated to that sexy chocolate brother sitting all alone in the back. Kenton Hughes, this is for you. Oh. Oh. Damn. Can't tell, right? No, you can't. I mean, you can tell me if you're like some kind of Pointer Sister or something. Oh, I shouldn't have done that. I really should not have done that. No, no. You actually were really good. I liked it. See, this is why I don't drink. Do I have a knot? No, I think you'll be OK. Well, I would really be OK if I could... If you could what? Man, you better... What'd you say? Cut it out. If you could what? No. How long have you and Brooke been together? What does that matter? Stop. Oh, my god. You wilding. I'm not. I'm serious. My head is hurting. I think I maybe had a little too much. No, man, you had like five sakes. You went in. I did not have that many sakes. Yes, you did. OK, maybe I had a little bit. But my head is really hurting now. All right. You have some kind of, like, headache medication in the kitchen or something? I do. I'll take that. Where is it? No. Where's your headache medication? It's over there. It's in the... it's over that way. Oh, god. Where? Your room? No, it's in the top shelf on the left. Find it. Well... What? Target? What? What is... Is He True? The hell is this? Likes basketball, neo soul. Wow. Oh, man. What? You know, I didn't call in a favor and shut this place down for you not to eat. You know I don't like surprises. Oh, then you're gonna hate this. It smells good. Mm, you should eat. What do you have up your sleeve? Oh, nothing. Just calm down. You have something up your sleeve. You ladies remember each other, right? Mandy, I'm so glad you're here. Please, have a seat. please Thank you. Mandy, Brooke. Brooke, Mandy. Wait a minute. Babe, I got something for you. Baby, open this please. It's for you. How you doing? Gentleman test? Yeah, that's what I just call the way you used to test me to, you know, see if I would open doors for you or offer my jacket to you if you were cold. You know, chivalry stuff. And I was honored to be your knight in shining armor. Honesty test. Oh, yeah. You remember that one, don't you? This girl is so crazy. You were so obsessed about me telling you the truth all the time. Yeah. And I... I didn't mind, either. I mean, even when you went behind my back to verify my stories. But I passed that test too, didn't I? You sure did, baby. You sure did. Let's see here. Yeah. And there was the... There was the career test, financial responsibility test, family man test, sense of style test. Damn, that's... that's a lot of tests, isn't it? But... but I endured them all because, in my eyes, you were worth it. OK. You know what? This is... No, no. Mandy, come on now. Relax. It's all good. Chill. I want you to see this. I tried this before, but it didn't go so well. But, uh, this time I think I got it right. So let's lift our glasses. Mandy, please, lift your glass. Here's a toast. Here's to no more tests. Come on, Mandy. No party pooper. Mm. Oh, yeah. Oh, one more thing. I got one more surprise for you. This is the kicker. You are going to love this. OK. All right-y. What have we now? Unbelievable. Yeah, you both fail. Brooke, uh-uh. You know, I know I wasn't perfect in our relationship. But I was faithful to you, even when I had to face temptation that you sent to me. And the ironic thing is that the... the one guy that you compare me to, the one person that you think is just totally perfect, Sophia's Mr. Wonderful... He couldn't even pass this test. Good evening, ladies. How did he get this, Mandy? Mm. Sophia? I'm in here, honey. You know, we were expecting to see you last night seeing as though you thought Kent was gonna propose and everything. Yeah, well, I was wrong about that. Girl, don't worry, honey. That man is gonna propose because I can see how much he loves you. No, Sophia. I was really wrong. What happened? Kent found out that I hired the man stealer. Now he won't speak to me. Wow. Yeah. Anyways, it was pretty dramatic. I'm sorry, Brooke. But you know what? I can't blame him. I'm sorry, honey. People don't always want to be tested. Look. OK, baby, look, OK, you made a mistake. OK, people make mistakes. It happens. But love... love can cover up all the hurt that we cause other people. Well... What? Kent said something about William. What? He said that, um... What? Something about he didn't pass the test himself? What? You know what? Don't. Don't even go there, OK? Because it's not about me and William. All right? And whatever you think you know, you don't. OK? Sophia. What, Brooke? What are you saying? Sophia, come on. You and William are like the ideal couple. OK, so what? Yes, we have problems. We do. Oh, gosh. We do. You have to stop comparing yourself to me. Be you, honey. Do you. Just because we have problems... that doesn't mean that you and Kent are going to have problems, OK? People put too much demand on love and this and that and the other, OK? If you love that man, then be with that man. But stop testing that man. Call him. I don't know how much good that's gonna do. Listen, honey. Call him. And you tell him you're sorry. And even if he's not listening, you keep telling him over and over and over, until he does listen. But you gotta be ready to change. And you gotta be ready to trust. You hear me? I hear you. Stop comparing yourself to me. Hey, baby. Oh, let me guess. Y'all must be talking about men again. You know it. All right, baby. I'll be in here if you need me, OK? OK. And, uh, you know, thanks to Mr. Hartsfield Jr, who is well into his 90s. And to this very day, every Saturday, he still comes here and volunteers. Yeah. He's a great guy, too. Yeah. Real cool. Um, but if you look over here, we have examples of some of the equipment that they used, like, in the '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s. Uh, somebody die? On your way to a funeral? He doesn't want to see you, Mandy. So... Oh, no, no, no. It's OK, man. I mean, unless she here to do something for your profile. Mandy, right? That's your name? Mandy? Is that her? I just came here to apologize to you. I'm really sorry, Kent, for everything... No, no, no. You don't have to apologize, OK? 'Cause we're done. Kent, I said I'm sorry. I mean, was it some kind of game or something? A challenge? Does it really matter? Hell yeah. I put myself out there like that. You get that? I understand, Kent. You know, I... I felt things too. I feel things for you, things I didn't expect to feel. I... at the end of the day, you are not mine. You're hers, and I get that. And to answer your question, no. It wasn't a game. But if you want my advice, don't take the easy way out. Forgive Brooke. Stop it. And rejection has never been something that has bothered us or deterred us, ever, especially me. I was not expecting to feel like this. What was I thinking? Wow, you really liked him. I... Who's that? Hmm. Hi. Uh, Mandy? Can I come in? Sure. Are you... are you good? I'm good. OK. I'll... I'll call you later. OK. Thanks, Nat. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Look, if you're looking for a fight, Brooke, this is not it. No, I'm not. I... I'm here to say that you were right, sort of. Have a seat. This test... it was a bad, bad idea. I don't know. I was hoping to find something horrible about Kent. I just found something horrible about myself. Well, for whatever it's worth, this has never happened before. And I could tell when I met Kent that this was gonna be different. He really is a great guy. Yeah. 1%, right? You said it. Yeah. Yeah, he's a... he's a great guy, isn't he? It took me too long to realize that, and now he won't speak to me. So... You're not the only one he won't speak to. He'll forgive you for that. You know, it's not your fault. Me, not so much. Look, Brooke, to be honest, I could have and I should have stopped it. But with the bet between you and I and Kent being such a challenge, I just... I wasn't thinking straight. Me and my challenges. Mandy, you were only doing your job. Me, not so much. You know, I haven't been a good girlfriend. So I don't blame Kent if he never wants to see me again or give me another chance. And honestly, I don't deserve another one. So, um, I guess you won on a technicality. Well, you did gift wrapped him and sent him to me. You don't have anything to worry about, Brooke. He's coming back to you, return to sender. Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Does your fee include a... a drink on the house? I think I can make that happen. Woo, thank you. K. K, have you been listening to what I'm saying, brah? I brought you here to get you out of your funk. Look around. Booty, booty, booty, booty rocking everywhere. What's up, baby? Come on. Look around you. Look... at all these women in here. Look at that one. She got low self esteem right there. That's good for you. You want somebody in your lowly state. You know what I'm saying? To get back in the saddle, if you know what I mean. No, it's not gonna happen, man? Why not? Why not, Kent? Huh? Why not? You got eye problems? Look around. Eh. I'll pass. Who are you, and what have you done with my friend Kent? Stop it, OK? Stop it. I know seven dudes right now that'd give their left one to have your problem. What is wrong with you? That's just what it is, though. It's a problem. It is not. I don't what to do. It is not a... both of them, at the same dang time, a menage a three, menage a four if she a Gemini. Look, do it. Oh, man, damn. You play too much. This is serious, man. Kent, Kent, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. All right. Let's talk. Let's talk. No, let's talk. All right? Wow, I'm Not. Really good at this, so I'm just going to give it to you straight. Um, you acting like a girl, dude. This is your idea of being serious? Excuse me. Oh. So you are serious. What's up? What's up is that your... your choice really isn't that confusing, K. It's Brooke. Yeah, look. I know. I know. I know I've been rooting for the visiting team. But I'm saying, over the last couple of weeks, man, she showed me something. Yeah. Hey, I guess that's the problem too. Like, I know what I'm getting with Brooke. But I'm kind of wondering what it would be like to get with Mandy. Right? Right? Stop wondering, OK? Stop, OK? Stop. We got a purpose in life. God put us here for a reason, OK? Mine... Stop. You really need to make that sound? That's me. That's me. This... yes. Stop, don't run. Wow. - Don't run. - Wow. That's me. All right? You the one that thinks with his big brain. Not according to Brooke. Look, brah, I know Mandy is hot, all right? I'm saying she's sexy. She's got junk in the trunk. Legs be all smooth looking, and toes be just thicker than a $4 milkshake and grits on Monday. I'm telling you, baby... Where was I going? I don't know. But I like where you were at. Stop. Stop, stop, stop. The point... the point is, yes, Mandy's hot. But dawg, she's a fantasy, man. And trust me. I know a thing or two about fantasies. You don't wanna end up like me, chasing fantasies. All right. All right. So what are you trying to say, Confucius? Well, grasshopper, what I'm saying is the grass isn't always greener. Tend to your own lawn. Keep watering the grass you've been watering for the past four years, man. Brooke loves you, K. She loves you. So what? She made a mistake. Big deal. OK, everybody makes mistakes. You too. Stop playing. Stop sitting over there, acting like you... you all Mr. Innocent, like you ain't... come on, son. Stop. You know? I mean, dawg, without forgiveness, how this love thing gonna work? That's deep, man. Run that back. Say that again, the... The forgiveness thing. Oh, I... I said that, you know, how this love thing gonna work without forgiveness? That's so nice. Stop. That's nice. - Stop. - I like that. You know what? Stop. I mean, I... Brah... I never knew. Brah, I said I'd watch you. I never knew it was there. Really? And you went there. Don't. Stop it. Don't touch me. I got to admit, I... I was... I was a little skeptical coming to a company that was as old as yours, understand. I didn't think you guys knew how to market us in a relevant way. But I am impressed. Taking the old school and then flipping it to classy? That's... that's what we're all about. That's great. I... I gotta be honest. I didn't know what to expect at first. But, um, I have total confidence in Brooke's abilities and her instincts. Thank you, sir. I mean, we are Phoenix Marketing. So we rise from the ashes of the old. And what do we do? We make something new. See? You like that? That's what I'm talking about. - There it is. - Yes. It's right there, right? Yes. You gentlemen excuse me. I'm gonna mingle a little bit. OK. - And we'll talk a little later. - All right. - All right? - Come back. All right. I definitely will. She's one of the best. Yeah? Yeah, she's one of the best. I didn't think you'd come, but I'm really glad you did. Hey... hey, Doug. Yup. Yeah, I didn't think I was gonna come either. But, uh, old friends gotta support friends, right? Right. Right, right, right. I don't mean to interrupt all the pleasantries, but is that Danielle? Yup, that's her. She's Sophia's eyes on the ground, seeing as how she's letting us use her house and everything. So... Right, right. You good here? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. OK. Not that you would care, but fine. Same Doug, huh? Yeah. Same old Doug. It's really nice seeing you. The place looks awesome. Um, man, I can't believe your sister let you use the house for all of this. Right? I mean, her and William are away on this couples counseling thing. So the house has been empty. That's good for them. Yeah, it is. Seems like everybody's having a good time, though. I mean, damn, who would've thought people were so into '90s throw back parties? Who would've thought that? I wonder. Yeah, well, I could fill this entire place with the things I don't know. I took the advice from an old friend. And, um, here we are. Wait a minute. You... you took someone's advice? Oh, damn, you must really feel guilty about something. I really do. And I'm really sorry. Look, uh, this isn't the time or place to discuss that, you know? Let's just, um... just try to get through this the best way we can, OK? Sure. Of course. Uh, would you like a drink? Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. Yeah? A little thirsty? Yeah. Can I have this dance? In front of all these people? It's OK. Come on. Trust me. OK. You know how they do in Chicago. OK. Hit it just like this. - OK. - Come on. It's called stepping. I just learned this too when I went to travel. Literally stepping. Yeah, literally stepping. This is how you do it. Just do what I'm doing, OK? OK. Just relax. I'm relaxing. All right. Cool. I'm gonna... I'm gonna put you in a spin real quick. You ready for this? OK. Hold on. Here we go. Oh. Ah. That's real good. I like that. That feel good? Yeah, that feels... feels good. OK. Hold on. One more spin. One more spin. Here we go. Oh, ooh. Now you see what happens when you let go? Yes. You see that? All right. Let me try this. OK. Do the dance move, OK? All right. Cool. Let's see. Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry. You thinking all the way out the box. Oh, my gosh. OK, OK. So much for style points. Yeah, for real. You know, I uh... I'm really happy I came tonight. Me too. Look, Kent, I know you don't want to hear it. But, um, I just want to tell you that I'm very sorry. No, seriously. I'm sorry for hurting you. I'm sorry for all the tests, all the doubt, all the comparisons that haven't been fair to you, all the fear. I'm sorry for trying to change who you are. You know, it's just... I was so focused on trying to have the perfect man and the personal relationship that I never stopped and realized I had all that. Um, and I totally understand if you never want to see me again because after that Mandy fiasco, I don't deserve another chance. So that's it. Um, and have a good night. Wait. You passed, Kent. I failed. Hey, I remember you. Hey. Are you here to cause more fireworks? Something like that. Kenton Hughes and Brooke Moore represent some of my best work. They love each other a lot. They've been together for about four years, and they just needed a little help remembering. Thanks for coming. You know, I like pork chops. Hey, listen, these last few weeks haven't really been anything to write home about. And, uh, there's still some things that we definitely need to discuss. I mean, you're saying that you don't deserve another chance. But it's not about deserving. I mean, who can say I... I deserve your love? Without forgiveness, this love thing doesn't stand a chance. Look, um, about that test, I, uh... I owe you an apology. No. Kent, this isn't your fault. And I can't sit here and let you apologize like it is. Are either of us perfect? No. And we never will be. But I put us in this position. And baby, if your heart... If it's big enough to let me back in, Kent, I promise you I will do my part to fill your heart with everything that I have, all of me. I promise you that. I like that. I like that. There's something else. What? I love you, Kenton Hughes. I love you too, baby. Will you have me? You know, that... that's funny. Um, I was about to ask you the same thing. Will you marry me? Yes, baby. Yeah? My goober. I love you. I love you, too. Put this on. Make it official. Ah, perfect. Waitress, champagne please. We are celebrating. That's for you. Perfect fit too. I know, right? I love you. I love you too, baby. Jennifer, sweetie, can you run this over to table four? Thank you. Brooke and I learned a couple of things, mainly that love is not about pass or fail. It's about honesty and commitment and trust. I learned a few other too, girl, but we won't go into that. But you look good, Brenda. It's good to see you. You too. Thank you. Can I buy the lady a drink? That depends. On? Tell me my drink. Hmm. That would be a pearl lemon drop martini to go. Yup, babe, my work here is done. Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. If you ever need my services, call me. I will. Who's gonna call whose parents first? I don't know. Girl, you probably should because your dad doesn't really like me. No, he'll love you, just like I do. Oh. Thank you. Congratulations, you two. You did it. It's from Mandy. Oh. Right? That's nice of her. That's great. And we did do it. Yes, we did.
