Here. You're putting too much in there. I'm sorry. Actually, I work really fast. Even so, he shouts me "Stop lazing around, work properly!" Mitsuru might have high standards. It might be, but it's really tough. I threw up the other day from stress. Huh, isn't that seasickness? No, it’s not. I think I should quit for real. If you want, you can come to us. I can't go out to sea after quitting Mitsuru. What other thing can you do? I'll go to the city and be a host. Host? They don't... ...have a funny haircut like this! Please don't touch me with rubber gloves. That old prick. Detour, please. Idiot! I can get through if you move that. No, sir. It's for pedestrians... Where the fuck are the pedestrians? No, but Shut up, you idiot. Get that thing out of here. Yes. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Allow us a car. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse! Sorry. I let a car through. What the hell was that? Soeda, it's so neat and beautiful but... How many more are you planning to make? That's right. Can you make it at your current speed? If you think about the time you spent making it... You can calculate the time remaining, right? Yes. I'm not going to make it in time. If that's the case, maybe you could speed up a bit, even if it's a bit rough. Or you need to ask someone to help you? Yes. That's what you have to think about. I always teach you that during study and such, right? Sorry. Ms. Imai Yes. Hey! Come on, give me a hand. Quickly! Hey, come on. Not there! Go to the middle! You've got to be kidding me. Come on! Come on! Don't you get it? Bring "Admission"! Come on, come on, come on. It's too heavy. Seriously. Huh? Is it crooked? Yeah, a little. I see. It's difficult. No? Kanon See you later. Mom, what about tomorrow? Tomorrow? I'm working late shift. How about Friday? Let's have dinner after doing this. I'll be with my husband on Friday. Do you mind? Fine? See you. No matter how strong the wind is... If only you could tie the rope properly, ... we wouldn't crash into each other. Huh? You tied it properly? Then go to the port right now and take a look. Bye. -Hey, Dad. -What is it? That ... What? Speak up. Sorry. I have something to tell you about school. What is it? Wait. Yes. Because you were drunk? Why don't you just take a cab? Don't make excuses. Just go! That fucking idiot! So, what's wrong with the school? I'm fine. What the hell? Sorry What? You have a cell phone? Eh? Get it out. Get it out, Quick! Oh, Kanon? What the hell are you doing giving her a phone? It's too early for a junior high! What? Even junior high students have them now... Dad, cell phone... I don't want this. But… "But" what? Ms. Kusakabe, I'll do it. I'm fine. Sorry. I may look like this, but I'm pretty strong. Awesome. I've got muscles, too. -See, it's hard. -Eh? Here. Oh, you're so hard. You've got more muscle than me. I don't think so. Naoto, you're surprisingly... bulky! -Amazing! -No, no. Not at all. That's right. Can I put up the volunteer leaflet over there again? Uh... yes. If it doesn't take up too much space. Thank you. Ah, manager! Yakitori lunch box. This is the last one. Okay. INTOLERANCE The body is severely damaged. I'm afraid it's difficult to confirm. Based on her belongings, I'm confident this is Kanon's body. Her face... Can I see her face? Yes. Kanon? -Let me see Kanon. -No. Why? Let me see her. Stop it. You better not see her face. Her head is crushed! Kanon... -Hey, don't do that. -Let go of me. -I told you to stop it! -Let go of me! Are you okay? -Are you okay? -What's wrong? -Ambulance. -Yes, sir. Hey. Ms. Nakayama, I will confirm again. After hitting the victim, You stepped on the brake. Is that what you're saying? Yes. And you were driving within speed limit. Is that correct? Yes. At what speed were you driving? How many km/h? Don't you remember? You don't remember? Or You don't know? I couldn't stop! Not right away! -Were you looking at the road? -Yes, I was! There are brake marks. Check it out. -Isn't it strange? No, it's not! How many times do I have to tell you? I stepped on the brakes right after I saw! Please be honest. I'm telling you the truth. -Were you looking? -Ahhh... I was looking! That girl came out! I hit the brakes as hard as I could. Are you looking at your phone? As you said earlier, -She suddenly jumped out. -Yes -Suddenly? -Yes, suddenly. We'll be closed for a while. The shoplifter, a junior high school girl, left the store. Ran away to this highway. and a tragic accident happened. Since it's a heavy traffic area, We wonder if the store went too far. Opinions are divided. Cut. Okay. What kind of person is the supermarket manager, who chased junior high school girl? We talked to some residents. Cuz of brain or heart? The father died suddenly. The son seems to have taken over the business. The former manager was a nice, cheerful person. The son is a little unfriendly. I don't really know what he's thinking. So, usually He doesn't have a lot of interactions? Yes. Ah Sorry to come suddenly. I tried to call a few times. Sorry. It's not your fault but... It's all over the news. So, I'm worried about you. Huh Here's leftovers from the cookout. You can have it if you like. I'm fine. This old lady who lives alone can't eat this much. Then.. So dirty. Are you properly cleaning up? Well... -Sorry. -I'll clean it for you. No, thank you. But I've heard a clean room makes you feel better. Really, it's fine. Then, I'll take this out for you. No, it's dirty. Don't. Then, this isn't dirty, is it? Tell me if anything. Thank you. Mr. Mitsuru Supermarket manager is here. What should I do? Um... about this matter. I really... um... And our response... Look people in the eye when you talk to them. Yes, sorry. So, what's with the response? I was too careless taking action. I couldn't have foreseen such an accident. We've been troubled by shoplifting for a long time. I've been working to reduce shoplifting as much as possible. Are you telling me my daughter's been shoplifting for a long time? No, I didn't mean that. I'm just saying, if I could handle shoplifting, we could've prevented all of this. -Hey. -Yes, sir. I don't think my daughter shoplifted. Oh... no, but... Do you have any proof? If you ask for proof... The security cameras aren't recording either, so... The police told me she shoplifted cosmetics. Yes. Nail polish. I've never seen my daughter wear makeup But we found it in her bag... I said, do you have any proof? -I'm sorry, that's... -What the hell with you? You haven't apologized at all, have you? What kind of nerve do you have? My daughter's dead. Because you chased her! Didn't you actually frame her for shoplifting as a prank? -That's not... -Hey. What did you do to Kanon? -Mr. Mitsuru, let's not do this. -Shut up! Ouch! Please stop. What the hell did you do to Kanon? Mr. Mitsuru! Tell me the truth! Apologize to Supermarket! What goes around comes around Your daughter is criminal! Wrong parent and child. Sex Offender Lolicon Bastard It's about the student. You're not being considerate, don't you think? Oh, yes. First, let us meet the manager. I'm sorry, manager's not here right row. He's not here. What happened? -I'm sorry. -Don't you understand the gravity of the situation? No sense of crisis? Yes, yes. You're right. Yes. Poor little fish. I'm sorry your life was wasted. Sorry. No, no, no. It's not because of you. It's not your fault. It was just an unfortunate accident. You don't look so good. Are you okay? Yes. It's important to take care of your mental health at a time like this. I can introduce you to a therapist. I'm fine, thank you. He's a really great therapist. Why not try seeing once? I'm fine. If it's money, it won't cost you at all. His name is Dr. Nagasawa. He's working as a therapist, but also in a non-profit organization... I'm really fine. Then, look for girls who wear makeup or have an interest. Kanon didn't wear any cosmetics. Someone must've forced her to do it. Even if you say so There isn't any bully in the class, right? Yes. But before she dies... She said she was having trouble at school. But we don't know if that's about bullying, do we? What else could it be but bullying? That's... If there's no bullying, Ms. Homeroom teacher, show me the proof. Proof that there's no bullying. Eh? If you ask me for proof... Your student was killed! Are you alright with this? -No, it's not. -Okay, then. Give me the list of kids who wear makeup. Mr. Soeda Ms. Imai also has school work to do and other students to take care of. As Ping-pong club advisor... One person is dead. Who cares about ping-pong? Then, it's not a list but let's hear from the students about Kanon... You don't need to do unnecessary things. But... Okay, let's say... What if there's a real case of bullying? You gonna tell him? I don't know what he'll do if that happens. Excuse me. Could you tell us a little about your current feelings? Mr. Soeda Excuse me. I told you there's nothing to talk about. How do you feel about the supermarket manager? It's none of your business. How do you feel about your daughter's shoplifting? She didn't shoplift! But the store claims that... The store is lying. Even if she did it, she must've been forced to do it. Has she ever shoplifted before? What the fuck? What do you mean? I'm just checking. You son of a bitch. Are you trying to start a fight? Get off me, you bastard! Please tell us your honest feelings. Did you get it? Okay. Okay. -Let's go? -Yes, let's go. This isn't good. You'll be on TV. They're fucking with me, man. They're treating Kanon like a criminal. I know but... I'm sorry, but... until Kanon's proven innocent, I'm not sailing for a while. You have to wait a little. What? Let's not do that. I'll pay you. That's not what I meant. What am I going to do? Cry myself to sleep? No, but... You too think Kanon shoplifted? I don't think that way. But honestly... I don't know. Kanon is old enough. It's not like she has zero interest in cosmetics. Besides, I also used to shoplift during junior high. Even if you take time off work, you never know when it'll be resolved. Let's not do this. I told you I'd pay for it. No, it's not about money. I see. You should get on another ship. Eh? You're fired. Are you serious? Can we stop doing that? I know it's hard for you. You know? What the hell do you know? How do you know what I felt when I see her crushed head? Can you even imagine that? I thought you were the only one on my side. I'm not your enemy. To be honest, I'd also have a hard time if you were my dad. I see. But you did talk to her, didn't you? Well, but... I don't even remember what we talked about. Right? Yes. We don't remember at all. Then, something like bullying, or even close to bullying. Is there something like that? Eh? Eh, if that happened, we'll remember. Isn't that kind of thing happens more to those who stand out? Yeah. Ms. Imai, what is it? No, nothing. Ms. Imai Hey, Shoko. What are you doing? Shoko, what are you doing? It's like they're watching Kanon. No, don't move it without permission. It's like a pathetic show! Okay. I don't know where but I'll call them. Okay? Wow TV people came here too. Yeah, I saw it on TV. Sorry I don't mind, though. Naoto, you've got to talk to them properly. I'm sure you're also in a lot of pain. Don't run away and face it seriously. People get the message when you transmit properly. The world isn't that bad, you know. Umm. Thank you. -How's your pregnancy? -Yeah, I'm fine. I see. And that... You sure you're not going to break down again or something? Yes Are you sure? Go to a hospital ... I'm fine. It's different from that time. Also, I can cope only for this child. I can't live with myself if I lose her, too. I see. I saw you on TV.. -Don't do anything weird. -Shut up. Kanon won't be at rest with you doing those. That's bullshit. Kanon was trying to talk to me before she died. She wanted to talk to me about school. She looked serious, but I didn't listen to her. So at least... At the very least, we should make up for her. What about the school? It's bullying, of course. That...it's about 3-way Interview. Huh? Kanon wanted me to come to the 3-way meeting, not you. It's not that small! She looked so serious. Isn't it your fault for trying to make a small talk serious? It's your fault for making her not able to talk normally! Bullshit! It's not like that. Definitely not! Come on. The more you make a fuss, the worse it'll look for Kanon. I won't stop, you idiot. It might be okay since you have a new kid. I've only got Kanon. I've got to live with the loss. You What do you know so much about her that you can only think of Kanon? What have you done for her? Do you know what nail polish color Kanon stole? She didn't steal it and I've never seen her wearing it. It was clear nail polish. You've never cared, right? If her nails are shiny or not. I don't want to think she shoplifted either, but... Go home. You son of a bitch, Are you selling me KFC? You son of a bitch, Are you riding on manta? Hey! Hey! After cleaning, fix the blade. Yes. Hello. -Yes? -Umm... I was driving the car in Kanon's accident. The name is Kaede Nakayama. I'm her mother. Huh? I'm really... I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry. Get out of my way. I'm going out. If I apologize to Kanon and your family... Get out of my way. Apologize... Two weeks after the accident, what do you think? Yes I'm really sorry about this. I believe it was all a matter of my own careless behavior. I see. But with so many stores troubling with shoplifting, isn't it difficult to deal with? Ah… To be honest, I feel uncomfortable the shopkeepers are being criticized for that. I feel there's nothing wrong with chasing after the shoplifter who runs away. But the responsibility for the loss of young, precious life is enormous. So, I still think this is my fault. I'm sorry to the bereaved family. I'll spend the rest of my life atoning. Yes. Okay. I know you're busy today. Thank you for your time. I believe that both bereaved family and viewers will be able to understand your sincere feelings after watching this broadcast. I was really moved by your sincere answer. Thanks. Thank you. This is... You didn't write down the names. For privacy reasons. It's anonymous, but we know which student it comes from. If you want to clarify anything, please ask. I'm not but... I get the vibe that none of them were close with Kanon. That is ... Kanon was very quiet. Yeah. She's the type who works alone quietly even in club activities. I guess I'll have to talk to the students directly. -No, I don't think so. -Why? They are also upset due to the accident. It's for their mental health, too. What the fuck? If that's how you cover it up, I also have my ways. Ah ... that What is it? I have something to tell you. What? It's about one student. The student has an elder sister. Three years ago, Her sister was molested by the supermarket manager, Can I talk to that student or her sister? Oh, that's a little... I'd also like you to keep confidentiality, about the fact that you heard this story from us. -Hello. -Yes? I had scolded or rather warned Kanon many times. Yeah? Like..lack of initiative, lack of effort. no motivation, like that. Isn't that the right kind of guidance? Yes, I've also warned her many times. That kid was... There's not even one area she's motivated. They'll be in trouble when they go out into the world like that. So, I think it's our job to teach them now. I thought so, but. Maybe she was making an effort in her own way. Eh... No matter how much effort you put in, there are children who don't seem to be recognized. For her, no matter how hard she tries, if she's constantly told that she's not motivated... that's… Ms. Imai That's not fair. It's not right to pretend you understand her now... Two weeks after the accident, what do you think? Supermarket Manager Naoto Aoyagi (34) Aichi Prefecture, Gamagori City To be honest, I feel uncomfortable the shopkeepers are being criticized for that. I feel there's nothing wrong with chasing after the shoplifter who runs away. I was speechless. Yes. He never admits he's at fault at all. What's with the smirk at the end? My heart aches for the bereaved. I think there must be another approach to handle this accident. You'll have to speak up. My people say they're willing to help. In the meantime, we need to start handing out leaflets. No, that's fine. How can you have such a weak mind? We have to tell the truth. Since it's not your fault. Hah. Don't give me "hah". It'll be okay. I'll make it right. I'm really fine. I'm really sorry for quitting during a tough time. It’s okay. I'm sorry too. No… You don't know what they'll say if you work in a place like here. Since you also have children. Oh... no. It's not that. I'm really feeling sick recently. We should have a farewell party. No, it’s really fine. No, we have to do properly. You've worked so hard for 3 years. But it's a difficult time... That's not the same. Even if it's a part-time job, We have to cherish our relationships. Ah ... no ... Do you always shop here? Yes, I do. Anything changed since the accident? I'm sorry, you can't do an interview because it'd interfere.. Welcome. Soeda's here! Now, the junior high school girl's... The father of the girl who was in accident... Can I help you today? I'm shopping. Am I not allowed to come? No, welcome. Mr. Soeda, please stop. Do it the same way you did with Kanon. I'm sorry, but... -Please come this way for now. -What the hell? With Kanon, didn't you grab her by the wrist? Please don't do that. You grabbed her hard, didn't you? Please stop. -Do it! -I'll call the police. Call the police? Then, why didn't you call the cops on Kanon? You had some ulterior motive! What the hell were you thinking? Ms. Kusakabe, I'm fine. Please leave. I'm not giving up until I know what you've done. Mr. Soeda, What does this mean? I think you're doing this to make a statement. Go away. What did you talk to Mr. Aoyagi... Are you okay? Ouch! What does this mean? I think you're doing this to make a statement. Go away. What did you talk to Mr. Aoyagi... Ah… This kind of violence is never acceptable. Anna Sato is expected to recover in 3 weeks and considering a lawsuit. Then who exactly is Mr. Soeda? We interviewed a person who said he knew Mr. Soeda well. He's always been known for his bad temper. I've had a few close calls myself. His eyes are not normal. He's gonna be in trouble someday. I've been thinking like that. Who that fuck he is? He knows me better than I know myself. I've never met anyone in a suit like that before. You guys are such assholes. All those false reports. Ah? What's that credible source of information? You can't tell me? Bullshit! Get me someone in charge! Natsumi, please get the can. That's a lot. Ms. Yamada Can I ask for this again? Yes. Don't worry. I'll take care of Kitamachi area. -Thank you so much. -Not at all. Amano will help with the website. Really? I'm totally useless at that. Thankfully! Leave it to me. -Ms. Natsumi -Yes Can you pass out leaflets with me at lunch tomorrow? Oh, tomorrow. I have an appointment. Appointment? I'm meeting a friend for lunch. I see. Sounds like fun. I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's not mandatory. I just want to do something good for others. It's just a matter of feeling. It's okay. It's okay. Mr. Mitsuru, are you sailing? Yeah I'm glad. Shall I give you Nogi back? I don't want it. I used to be one-man. He's slowing me down. It's easier without him. Thank you.

Then, I'll give this to Ms. Mochizuki. Thank you. Hey, Naoto It's okay to say if things are bad. Hah. You did the right thing. You have nothing to regret. Kay? Hah Hah ... What's that insecure reply? It's the important store your father left you. If you don't work hard, it will really collapse. There's an AEON mall nearby. If we go out of business, no one will be in trouble. That's not true. There are lots of regulars. We've lost a lot of them, though. I'm sure they'll come back soon. They won't come back. Don't say that. They'll be back. No, they won't come back. It's okay, they'll come back! No, they're not coming back! If they're not coming back, I'll bring them back. It's okay, I'll do it for you. I... When I got a call from my dad... What? It's not a big deal. What? Well... When my dad collapsed, I got a call. He probably called me when he was in pain, and unable to move properly. But I didn't answer the phone. I was playing pachinko. I owed him money and thought he'd give me a hard time. I won a lot of money that day. So while my father was dying, I... I was still playing. What should I buy with the money I won? I was thinking I've got enough money for tomorrow's bet. But you know what? If he made 3 calls to me, he should've called an ambulance. He's an idiot, my dad. I won't let him destroy. The supermarket. Naoto, too. From Mochizuki for her hard work. I'd like to get a word. Excuse me Everyone! I know it's a tough time. In these difficult times, we need to be united.

Thank you Milk 138 yen Egg 1 pack, 118 yen I'm sorry. Mr. Soeda Hello What? I was wondering if you could help me with something. I'm looking at Kanon's album right now. What is it ... Did you see that? What? Yeah. Is this some kind of bullying or... No. She did that herself. Huh? You don't normally do that. Yeah, It's a little unusual. You didn't care enough, so you wouldn't know. Bullshit. We lived together. I don't need you to talk to me like that. What do you know about Kanon? What's her favorite food? What's her favorite TV or music? It's that old man, the fisherman. I think he's crazy, or maybe he's just bored. He's really pissed off about something so stupid. I don't know. I wonder how he doesn't get bored. He's got nothing else to do, right? Hey! If you've got a problem with me, tell me directly. Yes? What is it? You have something to say to me. No, I don't. You've been talking about me. I can hear you. We were just talking about an old man who's addicted to video games. What is it? I don't get it. What is it? Tell me the truth. I explained it to you. You're lying. Hey, tell me! Hey! I know you can hear me. Tell me. Hey. Hey. Don't you dare ignore me, you bastard. Mr. Soeda? I'm so sorry. I know that no amount of apologies will make up for it. But... I don't know what to do except apologize. I'm really sorry. What the hell is that? You think that's enough? Anyone can do dogeza if they want to. I'll do it too. See? If only this would bring Kanon back, I'll do it as many times as you want, asshole. What do you want me to do? Tell me what you did to Kanon. That was really a misunderstanding. I'm sorry, but Kanon did shoplift. Kanon didn't shoplift anything! So, when Kanon died... Tell me how she died. So, when Kanon ran that far, you were somewhere around here? I think I was a little further back. Around here? Yes, maybe. And then what happened? Then she ran a little. She suddenly tried to cross the street. And collided with a car. Then, get me to that position. I believe that's where the first car hit her. After that? Then... She fell down around here... And? -And? -After that... The truck hit Kanon. It's not just a hit! She got caught under the car and dragged on the ground! How far did you drag her along? That's right. You dragged her that far. That's the only way she'd be that messed up! Even her organs were out. Bones pop out from limbs in several places. Her head didn't even have a shape anymore! Her eyeballs popped out and were barely hanging! Hey! Hey! Sorry, man. He's drunk. Give him a break. You gotta be kidding me. Come on! I'll kill you if you keep shouting, fucker! Mr. Soeda, I ... If you're gonna die, don't bother anyone else. Die alone. Those waiting for a special nori bento. Thank you. Ah ... excuse me. You're that Super Aoyagi, right? -Eh? -I'm always watching you. Can you take a picture with me? Oh, no? Mr. Ninomiya Oh. There's nothing suspicious. It looks fine. Thank you very much. You can go now. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. I'll leave first. Just in case. Bye. I ordered a special nori bento. I got an regular nori bento. Yes, it is. Karaage is not in there. I've already eaten. I told you I've already eaten. What? When I come back next time? I'm not going back there again. You bastard, I'll kill you. Hey, are you listening? I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch. Hello? I'm the one who called earlier about the Nori Bento. No, it's not. I'm sorry, too. Um... I'm really sorry about that. Oh...the bento, It was delicious. I'm sorry. Uh ... Committed suicide? Oh, yes. Yes. Sorry. I'm sorry. Why are you doing stupid things? What if you die? It's okay. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. It's okay. It's okay. Sorry. This old lady must feel creepy. I'm sorry. Sorry I lost my mind. But you see, dying is the worst thing you can do. Okay? If you do so, you'll be misunderstood by everyone. I don't care what they think. That's no good! We need to tell people what's right! Naoto, you're the right one. Please stop it. Righteousness... Forcing goodwill... It's just suffering to me. What is that? Being righteous or not? Annoyance? You say annoyance... Naoto, too. You think I'm a hypocrite. I don't think so. You do! If I were younger and prettier, you wouldn't think so. That's not what I meant. You think I'm creepy, don't you? You think I'm creepy and annoying! That's not what I meant. Now... now, it's just... I'm having a hard time with everything. Please, not again. I'm sorry. Let's not do this. Calm down. -Sir? -What? I'm not gonna apologize. I'm I'm really sorry. I know it's not a problem that can be solved by apologizing. She's responsible for the accident. I'm sorry she ran away like this. I'm really sorry. This is all my fault for raising a weak-minded daughter. I'm so sorry. I will bear the responsibility from now on, so please forgive my daughter, will you? My weak-minded girl. My irresponsible girl. But. She was a kind girl. She was always cheerful. She laughs at everything. She really was my favorite girl. So I think I understand the grief and pain of losing Kanon. That doesn't make her any less guilty, but please forgive my daughter. Please forgive her. Please forgive her. What? Can you give me another chance on your boat? Why? Because I want to ride. It's hard to be alone, Mr. Mitsuru. I've got enough strength. Yes, but... Dad went out to sea by himself, and never came back. How about Tanabe's place? I've already quit. If I don't get on your ship, I'll... I'll have no choice but to become a host. That's bad. What's going on? What's wrong? Mr. Mitsuru, I want to smoke. What is it? Okay. -Really? -Shut up! I've only just started. Eh~Really? Is this a dog? It's that one. Oh no! Is this a flying lizard? That's a dolphin. I don't see any dolphins! It's a cloud. Last year or something, there was a cloud in dolphin shape. I drew that. It's a fairy tale. I know this. You try to draw Mona Lisa, but it turned out ugly. That's Kanon. I'm sorry. I looked closely and she's beautiful. Pull the rope! I'm sorry. What are you reading? I found it in Kanon's room. Is it for painting reference? No, I stopped painting. After all, I don't have talent. -You get bored so fast. -Shut up! So, manga is next? Nothing... just... I wonder what Kanon liked. Is that so? Is that interesting? I don't understand at all. The store will be closed from May 1. Ms. Kusakabe What's your next job? I don't know. Whatever it takes. I've been invited to volunteer at a cookout. They're counting on me a lot. No matter how many bodies I have, I'll never have enough. Everyone depends on me. You're always amazing. I'm only thinking about myself. Mr. Ninomiya? What should we do with this? Oh, put here. Pease wait a little longer. Ms. Kusakabe Where did you say the wrap was? I think I put it there. Oh, there it is. There it is. Sorry. Hot! What are you doing! Sorry. Every time! Do you even want to do it? I'm sorry. Move. Go get your hands cool down! I'm really sorry. You got burned, didn't you? Go cool it down quickly. Thank you. -Shall I help? -It's okay. The double affair issue causing a lot of noise, has now turned into a triple affair, thanks to Mr. Watanabe's revealing book, and become confusing. Fried shrimp. Want some? I'll have some. So much coverage about me, and now this. I'm sorry, can you turn off the TV? Let it be. Your food. Is it a boy or a girl? Girl. Have you decided on a name? I was thinking of "Akane". It's nice! I wanted to make "Akane" as in "Maroon" but,... My husband said Take "Aka" from "Bright" and "Ne" from Kanon. I see. When I heard that, I cried. Isn't he a sweet husband? What's so sweet about him? Well, Mr. Mitsuru... I don't think it's interesting. It's not the dog's name. If one dies, the next dog will be named Shiro or Taro. No, that's not the case. Your husband doesn't take human life lightly, does he? Is it okay? How can such a shallow person be a parent? He just works in a cheap factory and wait for retirement. He earns that little money and... He's been through fertility treatments and finally had a baby. There's not even a guarantee. He saved and borrowed money and finally made it. My husband is not the kind of person you can call light or shallow. Why don't you stop taking it out on me? You're the one who can't forgive yourself. Wait, Ms. Shoko Here. Hold on. Sorry. I'm sorry. I was jealous of him. That child. Akane Grow her happy. How does everyone come to terms with this? Hey! Mr. Mitsuru. Excuse me, please detour ... Well. I should've given you my contact info when I closed the store. I'm really sorry. That's fine. Sorry. I've had some time to think about things since then. I think I've cooled down a bit. Yes. And that's it. Now I also think Kanon might have shoplifted. But. I just can't shake off the doubts that Kanon ran away because you did something to her. No, it's really, um... No matter how I'm told, I can't seem to get rid of it. I've lost my daughter. But you lost something important, too. Honestly, I feel bad for you. But on the other hand, I'm also frustrated. You're the same, aren't you? I'm... I don't know. Is that so? But if they're the same, You've apologized to me many times. I've never apologized to you. No. I can't apologize yet. I'm just... I just need a little time. I'm sorry I'm sorry. -I'm really sorry. -No No... I don't blame you at all. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I told you, it's not like that. Listen to me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm tired. I'm sorry it's been a while. Ah Well... This. I found Kanon's painting in the art room. If it bothers you, I'll put it at the school. No. Huh? Are you by any chance the manager of Super Aoyagi? No... I'm sorry about your store. I'm really shocked that the store is gone. The yakitori bento made by Aoyagi. I really like that! I mean, my late mother loved it so much. Hah. No, well. I don't know what to say. Thank you for your service. You've worked hard. Thank you. Please open a bento shop someday and serve me yakitori bento again! Bye.
