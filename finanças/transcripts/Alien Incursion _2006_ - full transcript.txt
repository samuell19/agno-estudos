(dramatic orchestral music) (engine rumbling) (growling) - It's behind us. (growling) Oh my God! (growling) (ominous music) (birds chirping) (chattering) - She's totally taking things for granted. You know what I'm saying? It's like, you know, listen to how beautiful it is. Listen to all those birds chirping. It's totally Mother Nature at its best, man, total tranquility. We need some peace and quite once in a while, you know what I'm sayin'? I forgot how good it was to get out here. Ah, dude it's so beautiful, I mean, we get so wrapped up in all that life stuff all the time. It's like we forget what's really important, you know what I'm sayin'? I mean out here, it's all so trivial, you know? It's like, we get so crazy about things, we forget what's really important. We've gotta focus on the tranquility, the peace. You know what I'm sayin'? I mean, dude, you could die at any moment, like just get hit by a meteorite. (thunder rumbling) (exploding) (coughing) (tense music) - Dude! Bobby, where are you? What happened, man? (dramatic music) (grunting) (groaning) (ominous music) No, no, no! (screaming) (ominous music) - Unreal, huh? - Boo! - [Man] Oh, God, Jesus! - I'm funny. - No, you're not. - I thought you liked a good scare. Hey, you like my bandana? - What? - Hey, you guys smell something? - Well, I didn't scare him that bad. - No, no. - Oh, man. - Something's real dead nearby. (flies buzzing) Whoa, gotta love the woods. What is that? - [Slade] You mean what was it. (flies buzzing) - Yup, looks like a bear kill. This doe was probably sick or injured. A wolf would've left more behind, bear kill. - What, bears hunt with hand grenades now? I mean, that's a really weird carcass, man. Looks like it was it like chewed up and spit out. - An animal could do that? - Yeah, some animals tear up their prey when they eat it. That's what it looks like, ladies, breathe deep. - That's messed up real good. - Actually, you know what? This kind of reminds me of American Werewolf in London. You know, just like when-- - Will you stop with the scary movies? Joking buddy, going to those horror movies done messed up your nerves (grunting). - Come on, let's check for some more spot fires. - Hey, you know what? I think I got bit last night. Do bugs carry diseases and stuff here? - No, not really. Well, Lyme Disease from the ticks, and that Hantavirus from mouse poop. - Mouse poop? - Mouse poop, and you got West Nile from mosquitoes, and oh, beaver fever, but that's more of like a water borne kind of-- - Hey, you ladies just ain't gonna cut it if you have a hissy fit every time you encounter something that's got more than two legs. Suck it up, OK? Let's get back to work. - Yes, sir. - Damn city kid whiners. - Ow, ah! - Hey, ever see the one with the mutant slugs? You know, got into people, started to breed till there's like so many of them, they just start to blow up. (ominous music) I don't now. Isn't really a chick flick though, huh? How come girls don't get into that kind of thing? - So, Slade, you just gonna sit there all day? - No, I'll be right there. - What the hell are you doin' anyways? - I don't know. I was just feeling a little weird. I'm fine. (exhaling) - OK, well, get up off your ass then. - Ooh, beavers. God, I love the woods. - Ranger Kelly, glad to see you. - Damn I ain't seen nothing like that before. - No, it's not your typical bear kill, something's up. - Space hole. - Yeah. - Yeah, meteor. (forced laughing) What do you guys think of my headband? - It's all right. - Not really. - It's a little hmm. (clearing throat) - Hey. Turn the dirt. See if there's any heat in there. - Yeah, we've been doing that. - [Slade] That's really nice. - [Trey] Yeah, you see the really nice gun too? See, rumor has it she shot the toe off some German tourist. - [Cheryl] Oh, God, that's disgusting. - What's going on? Everybody back. - What do you think did it? - Something big and hungry. Everybody just keep your distance from here, just step back. It's getting too late for us to hike out of the park right now. - Sorry, hike out? No, we're not hiking out of anywhere. We're on our honeymoon. Tell her, Claude. - Ah yep, this is our honeymoon. - Hey look, everybody can stay at our camp tonight. It's close by. - Looks like we're having a slumber party. You can sleep next to me. I'll protect you from falling rocks. Where the hell did that come from, whoa. (guitar strumming) - What? - This isn't what we planned. This is our honeymoon. I don't wanna, I wanted to be alone, not in the middle of a jamboree with a bunch of kids, you know, and ranger girl. - Well, Ranger said to stay put. - She's a ranger, Claude. She's not a cop. I say tomorrow we take off, salvage what's left of our vacation. - If you wanna wander around the woods and look for more piles of animal guts, be my guest. - Hi. - Hi. - You wanna go for a walk or something? - That's tempting, but I think I wanna stay by the fire for a little bit. - Suit yourself, blondie. - Hey. Hey, man, you don't look so hot. - Yeah, I don't feel so hot. I just gotta get some air, you know. - Dude, we're outdoors, man. Ain't nothing out here but air. - Hey, why don't you get off my back? I'm getting a little bit tired of you telling me what's what all the time. - [Man] Knock it off, guys! - Ow! Damn bugs. (sighing) - Hi. - Hi. - Well, that's a good start. I'm Terri. And this Honey. And you are? - I think he's shy. - Jack, I'm Jack. - Well, I'm gonna go find the ladies room. Don't worry about me. If I get lost, I'll just call for that other guy. Where'd he go, anyways? - Who, Slade? Ah, he went to go puke or something. - Hey, slow down. We'll be here all night. - This can't wait. - Yeah, well, watch out for that poison oak. (laughing) - That thing still not working? (sighing) (ominous music) (breathing heavily) (grunting) (coughing) (gasping) (coughing) (gasping) (coughing, spitting, gasping) - Hey. I was wondering, if you haven't finished that flask already. Maybe we could go for that walk? - Help. I need. (coughing) (grunting) (groaning) (yelling) (screeching) (snapping, gasping) - You don't think you'd have heard me unless I wanted you to, do you? - Jesus, Harry. - Yeah, nice to see you, too, Kelly. - What do you want, Harry? - When are you gonna call me by my real name? It's the same one I've had since you were born. It's easy to say, it's easy to spell. Three little God damn letters. D A D, Dad, it's short for father. - Well, you come up short as a father. What do you want, Harry? - I came about that rock that fell, the meteor. - What about it? It's a big hole in the ground now. - I came to warn you. You and all your friends. You're all in danger. - All right. What kind of danger are we all supposed to be in here? - Not so fast, not so fast. Can't we be civil? Have a real father daughter talk for once? You know you really remind me of your mom when you look at me like that. You have a temper. And you got her stubbornness, too. - It's my park. If there's any problems here, I need to know. What warning, Harry? - I really do believe you could beat any man alive in a pissing contest, even if he had a high wind at his back. - Harry, what do you want? - I want to warn you, you and all your friends. That thing that came down out there, it'll bring you grief, you hear? You're all in danger. You want to get out. You want to get out now, before they come. Because they tracked it. You know they tracked it, and they'll be here, they're on their way. - Oh Lord, not this again. - Listen to me, I've seen this before, so you listen and you listen to me good, girl. Those things come down out of the sky and they bring hell with them. You don't believe Uncle Sam doesn't know about it either. - Stop it. Don't you dare do this to me here. - [Harry] You wouldn't let me throw water on you if you were on fire, would you? You really are as stubborn as your mother. - What do you know about Mom, Harry? You were never around. You even missed the funeral. Where the hell is Slade? I thought I told y'all to stay put. - [Jack] He went for a walk. - Slade. - He's being a bitch. - Yeah, well, he ain't seen nothing yet. If he's not back soon, go fetch him. To hell with it, just go fetch him now. - How many times I warned you? Don't cross the ranger. - I said go get your buddy. - I want to get some sleep. I'll do that right after I find Slade. - We're going for a walk in the woods, come on. - I'll be sure to grab some extra sleep for you, Jack. (laughing) You should get the ranger to look at that. - So now I'm gonna get the silent treatment? - What would you prefer? - [Claude] I'd like a better attitude. - I can take you out and look for guts, if you'd prefer. - [Claude] Why would we do that? - Is this how we're gonna solve all of our problems, Claude? Huh? Blame shifting? - I'm not blame shifting. - What do you call it, then? - God, who wears the pants in that couple? - I am never getting married. Life is way too short to be tied down, especially if you're like that. - You know. All I wanted to do was spend a little bit of time alone with you, is that such a problem? - Well, it's hard to spend time with you when you keep-- - It's hard to spend time with me? - No, just. - No, that's what you said, Claude. - All day long you've been on my ass. - Oh, been on your ass, huh? - I can't believe we're out in the middle of the night doing this. I mean, what the hell is she worried about? - I know. Slade. You know, I'm sure he's fine. Screw it. Let's go back to the camp. Plus, we got guests, right? (ominous music) (chewing) (tense music) - Yes, sir. Understood, sir. Stand by. Sir. We have a complication. (dramatic music) (ominous music) - What the hell? (tense music) - Hey, Sam. Sam. - You look like hell. - Thanks. I was wondering. - We should tell the ranger. - No. Just. Just let me sleep this off before you go drag me out to that drill sergeant, OK? - Wow, it's beautiful out here. I wonder when the ranger will make us leave. - Let's go for a walk. - OK. - Girls. Ranger was here earlier. She couldn't get her ranger radio working. She doesn't want anybody going anywhere until she hears from high command. - Good morning to you, too. (ominous music) (dramatic music) - Jesus Christ, girl. - Jesus Christ yourself, Harry. What's making you so jumpy? Who you gonna shoot? You can't have that in my park. - I have the right to bear arms. - Again with that? - You'd disarm your own father? - You'd shoot your own daughter. Now hand it over. You could have Life Alert for personal protection, not your hand cannons with Teflon ordinance, Harry. - Keep it. I have more. - You give me grief, and I'll come over there, and I'll take those, too. - Well, that'd be one way to get you to come over for a cup of coffee and a sit down, wouldn't it? - What are you up to, Harry? - There's these camo dudes all over the woods. And there's weird stuff going on. I know a black operation when I see one, I can smell it a mile away. Don't give me that. Have you tried to get out on your radio lately? - The radio has been down. It goes down a lot. Sometimes for days. Sunspots, Harry. You know all about that. - I know they jam communications. I also know they're the ones that got rid of those animal remains. There's 20 of them. Come on. (dramatic music) Same as the animals. And the crater, it's all covered up all nice and pretty. Like it was never there. They want alien technology and they want alien organisms, and they want it for themselves. They cover this stuff up all the time. - Cover up what, Harry? It's probably a cougar. - No, I don't believe that and neither do you. I've seen this before, Kelly. OK, well, that's fine, girly. You just be like that, but you take damn good care of yourself at the same time. You hear? You and I are gonna have that talk, too. Soon. - I still think we should wait for the ranger. And tell her we're leaving. - I'll pin a note to the fridge, OK? I'm not staying here with these kids. Go somewhere private where we can do what we came here to do. - Now you want to go fishing? I was just kidding. We can fish later. (dramatic music) - Oh. - Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Can you help me up? I don't feel well. I need some air. - What have you kids been into? - Nothing. - God. - OK, OK, OK, let's sit you down, come on. Come on. (gasping) - Hey, you're up. You feeling better? - Claude. - You OK? - My stomach hurts. - That girl's really sick. - And we'll let the ranger handle it. I don't want us to get what she has. Oh, that's great. Great, Claude. - Can we get you anything? - I really need help. - OK. (whispering) - So, we're supposed to look around every tree in this park? - That's what the ranger says to do. - I don't even know where he is. We don't got any way to call anybody in town, you know, so you ask me, he's probably sitting around, having beers with that weirdo Harry guy, having a good laugh at us out here looking for him. - Yeah, well, we're gonna keep on looking for him. OK, Jack? - You're just sucking up to the ranger. You know, we both seen the way that you look at her. - You haven't seen anything, OK? And unless you want to be tied to a tree for a couple days, you ain't gonna repeat that to anyone. Hey, are you listening to me, Jack? - What is that? - Oh, shit. (ominous music) Flayed him. (growling) (dramatic music) - Stay away from the remains. - Who the hell are you? - I'm here to help. Sorry to scare you boys. You all right? (sighing) - Yeah. We are now. Who are you? - Part of the team that came here to help you. - Well, there's some others back at our camp. Could use some help. - This area seems secure. Why don't you take me back to your camp and we'll see what we can do. We have humans xenomorph contact. Subjects seem all right. I'm going back to camp to check on friends, over. Understood, over and out. All right boys, lead the way. - What about Slade? - I'll take care of it. (ominous music) - I'm so cold. - How is she? - You didn't find the ranger? - She looks worse. Is she shivering? - Yeah. - Could mean her fever's gonna break. Could be good. You know we're like her friend and all, but maybe we shouldn't be so close. - [Kelly] You all right? - I think he's coming down with something. We'll be fine as soon as we get out of here. - One of them is sick. - Not them, too. - Hey, when are we getting out of here? We have a honeymoon to get back to. (coughing) - This is what Slade looked like last night. - I don't believe this. - What happened to her? - She's been bit. - It's her stomach that's bothering her, though. - Just get through this and then we'll laugh about it on some beach somewhere, OK? - Look at the skin on her wrist, it's necrotic, rotting flesh. - [Terri] Isn't there somebody we can go get? - Unfortunately, we're in hundreds of square miles of state forest, not a tourist resort. We don't even have a communication, so we're on our own. Samantha. Samantha, answer me. (groaning) (dramatic music) - [Terri] What the hell is happening to her? - She's having a seizure. (groaning, yelling, crying) (screeching) (gun shooting) (yelling) - Take it easy, ma'am. - Who are you people? (tense music) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, they're here to help. - It's cool, they're friends. You guys are not gonna believe what's going on here. - Actually, I think they already know. - I said who the hell are you? - I'm lowering my weapon, ranger. - We're here to help with your problem, ranger. - Yeah, but the problem is you shot that girl. - She was already dead, ranger. (ominous music) (swelling music) Your problem is that you have an incursion. You have an incursion and we're here to help you deal with it. - Ranger. They did help us when we found Slade's body. - Slade's dead? - Yeah. And from the looks of 'em, whatever got your friend there, has got him, too. - Ranger, I think we should listen to them. (tense music) - [Jack] These guys look really geared up. - Kind of reminds me of predator. - Ranger, I assure you we are here to help. - I need to evacuate these people. Whatever happened to that boy and Slade and the girl, I don't want it happening again. So who are you with, and do you have transport? - I'm sure you saw the meteor impact up the mountain line. It wasn't the most subtle of celestial events. - I don't care about that. I care about these people. Now if you're gonna help, then help. - That meteor brought with it an organism. And that organism seems to be especially adaptable to this world. We're here to get rid of it. - You're serious. - I'm dead serious. - You're telling me than organism has something to do with what's going on? - You've seen with your own eyes what it can do. Now I ask you. Are there any others in your party? - We have three dead people. - I understand that. We're here to stop people from dying. - Tell me. What the hell are you really doing here? - Ranger, you have a threat in your park. A threat to all life. So I ask you. Are there any others? (ominous music) - You're not here to help us. (dramatic music) (grunting) - Hey. (grunting) - Hey. (coughing) (gun shooting) (coughing) - Do I have your attention now? Search 'em all. - Leave them alone. - I'm gonna ask you one more time. Your last answer wasn't so convincing. Are there any others? - I told you no. - Then where'd you get the second gun? (spitting) (grunting) How horribly do you want to die? This is what happens to anyone who's been infected. This incursion must be contained here and now by any means necessary. - I got one. - Leave him. - Show him. - Contain him until the creature appears. At least we can get one live sample. - No, you got to help me. (dramatic music) - Why? - No. Not like her. Not me. - Claude. - All right, everybody drop to the ground. Now. (tense music) What do you think this is, a Pilates class? Down. (grunting) - Everybody stay down. - Grab him. (grunting) (dramatic music) (grunting) - Can we keep them behaving? (grunting) The next one of you that does something stupid is gonna get a hole in the head. Personally, I hope it's you. (tense music) (gasping) (gun shooting) (breathing heavily) (cocking gun) - Please. I don't want that to happen to me. - All right. (grunting) (breathing heavily) - Claude. (groaning) - [Stucker] What's going on, report. (tense music) - Report this, you son of a bitch. You let everyone go, or this soldier here gets his head blown off. - His head blown off. Well, that's real movie talk. A little housewife like you do something like that? Go ahead, blow off his head. There's plenty more where he came from. This ought to get real interesting. - You hear that? They don't care if you live or die. - Go ahead. You and your friend walk right out of here. - Back off. - There's a big difference between spraying people with bullets and hitting them with sticks. It's tough to pull that trigger, isn't it? Even if it means saving your own life. - You stupid bitch. - I'll take that. Now. Let me show you how it's done. (dramatic music) (gun shooting) - You guys all right? I guess not. - They've got everyone back up at camp. - Damn, I warned her. OK, you two take the trail. Go on, out now, go. (ominous music) (tense music) (gasping) - Come on. Come on. (grunting) (groaning) - It's happening to me. - Come on, keep moving. I got you. (coughing) Claude, Claude, Claude. I know you hurt right now. But we've got to keep moving. - You saw what happened to that girl. I don't want that to happen to me. - No. No. (crying) (coughing) (gasping) (grunting) (growling) (grunting) - All right, sweet britches. One last time. Are there any others out there? - What are you gonna do? Kill us all? - Enough with the bright ideas. I might just take you up on that. (gun shooting) - This is why I like my Teflon. (gun shooting) Run through the gates. - Go. Go. (gun shooting) - Scary Harry Jones. (gasping, grunting) That son of a bitch. - You know this guy? - After all these years, and he just walks right up to us. Let's finish this. - We're a man short. - He'll catch up. Fan out. - Everybody stay in sight, follow me. (tense music) (dramatic music) (coughing) (grunting) (coughing) - Come on, buddy. - Please tell me what's going on. I feel like I'm in a freaking Die Hard movie. - I'm thinking now isn't the time for this. (dramatic music) - Come on, let's go. - Give me a sec. - Where's Terri? (gasping) - She was behind us. - Well, not anymore. - If those psychos find her. - If those psychos find any of us out here, we're done for. Let's get back to the cabin, we can dig in. - You can go, I'm not leaving her behind. - We have to keep moving. - Then you move. I'm not leaving her behind. - Christ, forget it, I'll get her. It's better than standing out here arguing. Kelly. 20 years ago, I met up with men like these. And I spent most of your lifetime running from them. Everything I told you is true. Tonight, the running stops. And don't just walk right in. Remember to knock. - OK. Let's move. (coughing, grunting) (coughing) - It's happening. You gotta leave me, nothing you can do. - I won't leave you. We'll get some help for you. We'll get some. (growling) God. I won't leave you. - I'm sorry for what I called you. - [Cheryl] Claude. - Get the hell out of here. - I won't go. - Go. Go. (gasping) Get out of here. (growling) (breathing heavily) (yelling) (coughing) (screeching) (breathing heavily) (dramatic music) - OK, Terri. Terri, I need you to be real, real quiet. OK? OK, OK. Just real quiet. OK, let's go. - Shh, shh. (whispering) (tense music) (dramatic music, yelling) Jesus. (gasping) - Over here. We thought you guys were dead. - Claude is. - Save it for later, let's go. - Come on. (gasping) - Come on. - Just a sec. - We can't lose 'em. (gasping) Come on, we got to keep moving. (growling) - Those things are everywhere. (screeching) Trey. (yelling) - Hit it. (grunting) Grab that stick. (grunting) (laughing) OK. OK. (laughing) Trey. (growling) (dramatic music) Trey, come on. - Run. Get the hell out of here. - No. (grunting) (growling) - Damn, where are the others? - Maybe they fell behind. - Grabs his guns. Weird alien things. I don't think they just fell behind. (dramatic music, growling) What the hell? - Come on. We're at Harry's house. - [Jack] I sure hope he has a lot of guns. - You have no idea. Wait. - What's going on? - Harry's a tricky guy. - What, is this to keep animals out or something? - No. People. - Hey. - Cheryl. (gasping) - Where's Trey? - He's gone. (gasping) - Come on. (melancholy music) - Come on. Can we hurry it up? Those things are right behind us. - We don't want to just run into Harry's place without knocking. Now we go in. - [Jack] No wonder you knock. - You know this place pretty well? - Yeah, I've been here a few times. - You and old scruffy mountain man aren't an item are you? - No. Scruffy mountain man is my father. - Oh. Open mouth, insert foot. - OK. So what do we do now? - Hold out as long as we can. Hopefully Harry will show up with Terri. The odds will be better then. He has a shortwave radio. Maybe we'll be able to get a message through, if we're lucky. - Yeah, we've been really lucky so far, huh? - Stay low, don't turn on any lights, and keep quiet. I've got to go back and get the generator on. - I'm going with you. - This place is really creepy. Kind of like Evil Dead. - I was thinking more along the lines of Night of the Living Dead. - You would have been fun to hang out with. - Don't get all past tense on me now. (ominous music) - You don't listen much, do you? - Nope. Claude used to say I was too busy talking. - I'm sorry about your husband. - Thanks. I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time. - It's all right, I'm tough. - Yeah, you are. So where's he get the fuel? I didn't see any self serves around here. - Harry takes some bush pilots hunting a few times a year. They bring the drums in by helicopter. - He likes his privacy, huh? - Yeah, Harry's pretty independent. Doesn't like people much, or trust 'em. Believes in all sorts of wild conspiracies. Big foot, alien abduction conspiracies, all that. - You can almost choke on the irony, huh? - Maybe. (engine rumbling) Let's go. (ominous music) Is there anyone out there? This is Ranger Kelly Jones, I'm in need of immediate assistance, over. Is anyone out there, over. - [Stucker] We're receiving you, Ranger. - I need you to get hold of the state police. You have to find them and get them to come here, over. - [Stucker] What? - Who is this, over. - We own the air waves, Ranger. Please just be reasonable. We have a helicopter, we'll evacuate everyone. You win. (beeping) Get a read on it? - Yeah. Half a clip. Dead ahead. - They certainly are. (tense music) - Sons of bitches. All right, everyone. Has anyone here ever handled a firearm? - Paintballs count? What, point and shoot, right? How hard is that? - I really wish your father was here right now. - Yeah, for once, so do I. (tense music) OK, everyone, listen up. Clip goes in like this. Safety off. Rack 'em up. Ready to shoot, OK? Aim the gun like you're pointing your finger. And go for the mass of the body. Squeeze the trigger, don't jerk it. And exhale when you shoot. When you're empty, pop in a new one. You got that? - Yep. - Glad someone knows what they're doing. (tense music) - Oh, gross. - Shh. Get behind that tree. (tense music) (snapping) (grunting) - [Man] Get off me, old man. Get up. (grunting) - Hello, Harry. Been looking for you for quite some time. - Yeah, you wasted a lot of time, Stuck. Because I was here, sweetheart. (grunting) - We got a lot of catching up to do, Harry. I think he almost had you both. - He's tougher than he looks. - Must be that diet of oats, nuts, and pine cones, or whatever it is these woodsy types chew down on now. - Maybe he's been chowing down on that pretty little ranger. I think the old pine cone kicker here has a soft spot for the ranger, personally. - Nah, not Harry. He likes his solitude. Besides, marked men make lousy boyfriends, right, Harry? So what have you been up to lately, Harry? Besides bulking up for the winter? (tense music) You know, the last time I saw you, you had your tail between your legs, and you were scurrying through the bushes like a little girl. (ominous music) - Well, what do you think? - I think the ranger's definitely in casa de term right there. What do you say now that we got all the hens in the hen house, why don't we get cracking and gather us up some eggs? - You bore us all to death with bad metaphors? - Well, we could just end this incursion right here and now by killing everyone and sterilizing the landscape, you like the sound of it better when I put it that way, mountain man? - You're a real bathroom poet, Stucker. (grunting) - Suck it up, Harry. (frogs croaking) (tense music) - Where are you, Harry? (sighing) - Hey, what does that do? (growling) (zapping) (dramatic music) - That was for Samantha. - And Claude. (zapping) - Too bad it didn't get in. Save us a little work. - No, better we do it ourselves, just to be certain. No evidence, no witnesses. - You're all heart. - Since we last met up, Harry, I've learned to be thorough. Loose ends come back to haunt. Let's announce ourselves. (dramatic music) - They're coming. Stay down, stay away from the window. That's far enough. - I told you before, Ranger, you win. This has all just gotten out of hand. I promise you we will evacuate you all. You just gotta keep your word that you're not gonna say a word about any of this. - Why should I believe you? - What's with the paranoia? - What's with you shooting people? - They're not coming out just to make your job easier, Stucker. You have no leverage here. (tense music) (grunting) - Let him go. - Well. You can't say we didn't try diplomacy. You know, I'm thinking old bush master here looks like take my gun from my cold dead fingers type. There's no telling what we're gonna be walking into with a frontal assault here. - Cold dead fingers, I like it. - Shut up. Hold him. We aren't playing here, ladies. You know, I think they're gonna come out right quick when you start screaming good and loud, and then I'll have all the leverage I need. (screaming) What do you say, ladies? I got nine more here. - No. - Don't do it, Kelly. - Again. (crying) - Daddy, I'm sorry. - [Stucker] Hold him. - Tough little bird, this one. - Harry, Harry, Harry, this can only get worse. (dramatic music) (growling) (screaming) - We don't have all night to cut off body parts, Stucker, let's get on with this. - You question my authority? (screaming) - Terri. - Help me. Help me. (tense music) - Not just yet. Let's see if they let little sweetie pie there fry. (gasping) - Come on, girl. - Help me. (tense music) - Come on, come on. (gun shooting) (gasping) - We need to put pressure on the wound. (melancholy music) - It's not stopping. - He must have a first aid kit or something. - He doesn't have an operating table, and that's what she needs. (gasping) - Just keep pressure on it. (crying) (ominous music) - I am not gonna stay around here for them to get us. They're gonna get in sooner or later. We have to bring 'em to us. On our terms. - Sounds great. Any ideas? - We lure them in. And take them out. (tense music) Now if any of you don't think that you can kill. - I can kill. - All right, time to put Pops here back to work. - Don't tell me he croaked. - Coffee break's over, old man. - Come on, don't you die on us yet. (gun shooting) (grunting) - Harry. - It's in my arm. It's in my arm. Get it out. - What the hell happened? - He's been compromised. - Guys, what's happening? - You know what to do. - Procedure. Sorry, partner, you'd do the same for us. (gun shooting) (grunting) (tense music) - I will shoot him again. Now you come out of that cabin. - No, Kelly, don't. (tense music) - Perhaps they need just a little more visceral pressure, huh, Pops? Harry, unfortunately, we're gonna have to set you on fire. Just to see if the sight of us roasting marshmallows over your sorry ass cracks their steely feminine resolve. Oh, no, better yet, castration. Yeah. The sight of dear old dad getting his nuts blown off is certain to bring 'em out. - This is not the mission, Stucker, this can wait. - Harry, Harry, how about a good old fashioned scalping? Huh? I am gonna make this man scream. - Well, now what? What the hell are we doing? - I have to go out. He's my father. - This is not the mission. - Getting them out of that cabin is the mission. (tense music) One. Two. (creaking) Oh, hello. - No, no, Kelly, don't do it, don't, no, no, no. - Come on and join the party. Bring the rest of 'em with you. Turn off the grid. - One of them has got a broken ankle and the other girl is injured. - Yes, I know, I shot her. - Kelly, what the hell do you think you're doing? Do it. (tense music) - Don't forget to knock. - Oh, yes, we'll be certain to wipe our feet, as well. (zapping) (tense music) (zapping) - Daddy. (gun shooting) (grunting) (tense music) (gun shooting) (grunting) (gun shooting) (grunting) - Get the door. Jack, help me. (grunting) - God damn it, Kelly. - Hold still. - Why didn't you just stay put? How we supposed to get out of here if we're all shot? - I'm not getting out. No matter what. (crying) - When? - Earlier on, in the bush, I guess. (crying) - I don't know what to do. - Don't give up on us, don't give up. Don't you give the bastards the satisfaction. (grunting) Never quit. (crying) Dad never did. (gasping) All he did was protect us. (crying) And I never believed him. Let's make them pay. (ominous music) (tense music) (gasping) (grunting) - This should hurt like hell, but I can't feel a thing. - You will, you're in shock. (yelling) - Son of a bitch. - Told ya. (growling) - Geez. (grunting) (growling) (gun shooting) - It got me good. - Yeah, well, I got him back. (coughing) - We got to call this off. - No, no, we finish this ourselves. - Just about where he crapped through the air, Stucker. It is way beyond protocol. You're making this personal. You've got to call this off. - Maybe you're right. (gasping) I think I'll have the last word on that. Shut up. - I heard something. I swear. I heard something. (gun shooting) (gasping) We're not gonna make it. - Come on out, Blondie. Or I'm gonna huff, and I'm gonna puff. (grunting) (tense music) How do you like Earth so far? - Come closer. Harry's got an ATV, around the back, by the generator. - An ATV? Why didn't you say something before? - Because it only takes two people. - We're not just gonna run out on you. - I'm gonna last long enough for a doctor to get to me. So just shut up and listen to me, OK? - We can't just run outside. Everybody's got guns or teeth and they're out to kill us. - There's a way. The gun cabinet. - Secret panel? - Yeah, just open it up. Hurry. Get going. Jack, come and get her. - Come on. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, too, kid. (tense music) Now get going. - Come on, Jack. (gasping) - Come on, you son of a bitch. Come on and get me. (tense music) (gun shooting) (grunting) (yelling) (screeching) (grunting) (screeching) (yelling) (tense music) - Come on, come on. Hey. Cool. - Yeah. (engine roaring) It's behind us. (growling) Oh my God. (yelling) (growling) - God. Quick, come on, come on, hurry up. Shoot it. Shoot it. Shoot it. (gun shooting) (exploding) (engine idling) (engine roaring) (tense music) You all right? Think we should tell them? - They'll never believe us. - Right. Then let's just get out of here. They'll know soon enough. (ominous music) (dramatic music)
