FOXFIRE "Do not ever tell Maddy Monkey" they warned. "If you tell, you're a dead man. " But now, after so many years then, I'll tell you. Who would prevent? All, I was involved in drafting the the original rules. I was in Foxfire Official Chronicle of the script. The only one which was believed to be made change our actions into words. Permanent evidence. Typed, clean, dated entries. We were hoping that it would become historical document - where the truth would live forever. This would avoid distortion of the owners, misunderstandings and lies evening. As we did those things only evilness. But worst of all Foxfire were lies. Maddy! Wake up, Maddy! Maddy, it's me, Legs! You let in or not? Mother sleeps. Carefully. Did you walk up here to Plattsburgh? - I walked. I do not think so. That's more than 160 kilometers. I'd walk 1600 miles if more would not have to live with the grandmother. He is so weird. takes me do silly things around the house. To do the dishes, clean up the bathroom. tried even teach the bed petaamista. He said: " Things can be done either on the right or in the wrong way. " I laughed in the face. then I said, something that I made up my math class: "No, the right ways to have only one, false in the millions. " "That's why everything goes to hell. " He just stared at me. As if I had slapped him. Thank you, thank you, thank you! - Stay here as long as you want. Do not worry, Maddy. Tomorrow I will leave the old man's. He can not get her daughter so easily overcome. Maybe he would call the police. Stop it. Thank you for helping me. In this way it should be: If a girl is in trouble, he can go to another's. Another take care of her. As you do. No questions asked. Does not it? Yes. As always, the Legs talked and I listened. You have a place in my heart, Maddy. Probably that night, 16 March 1966 Foxfire was born. At least according to Legs. Who knows? We did not even have a name. But soon, and for this I am sure - Legs came up with it: Foxfire. He said he had heard it in a dream. Yes, Foxfire was a sisterhood. It was the secret of loyalty, trust and a bond of love. Yes, we were outlaws. We did things which could be called a criminal offense. Impunity because exclusively male - sacrifice were ashamed to complain too much. Stop it! - Like this? Stop it!

It just happens. Margaret, why do you look at me like I'm disgusting? Maybe you are. After all, you do not say anything. You just sit there and cries. I'm not as tough as you. - You'd fight, Rita. " Shall we go to my class to study the anatomy of the woman? " Tell him to fuck off, Rita. Get the fuck out! You have to decide how to let men treat you. Buttinger and his neekerihuulensa. Out of the way! - What's the matter with you? Rita! Filthy piece of shit! Pads still in hell. You heard me!

I attended the Socialist Party the party conference in New York. There were thousands - of men and women. My brother. My sister. My partner. I stood among them, International and sang. And...

I do not throw it away, if I five. Then sell it to you. I do not have five dollars. - Ask your mother. I can not. - Why not? By the way... Your mother should learn how to how not to get fired. I have three U.S. dollars at home. Can I give the rest later? Okay, before you get the money Negroes take stuff down. Sell вЂ‹вЂ‹it for you. You made a good deal. - I know, thank you. Hey, Maddy.

If we were not careful, Foxfire lose. Foxfire FLAME DOES NOT GO EVER Foxfire - NETWORK Probably the bastards Oldwick. - No, wimps throughout the loess. But always try to annoy us. - There is a Viscount revenge. Hacking into their school with and break the windows. It reminds of religious symbols. - What is religion?

Margaret SadovskГЅ, Mr. Greene says they saw a tattoo on your back. It reminds them of graffiti, which we have removed from the walls. How he has been able to see it? It was a mere coincidence. - Does she go to the girls' locker room? You know that the school has a strict the rules of the secret societies in terms. Do you know the rules, Margaret? I have not broken the rules. First comes fear, then respect. The oppressed rise up in rebellion and draw up their own laws. This has been the each revolution. In 1776. In 1789. In 1848. And, in 1917.

Happiness is a journey, not a destination. But we do not understand it as it occurs. One day, when the die is cast the last time... When all is over, awaken - like a dream. And we will say, " Yes...

You can not be serious. - Here he comes! Are you crazy? Drive, drive! - Oh, my God! Go! Hey, hey! - What if it is to call the cops, Legs? Look at that son of a bitch. - Do Legs! Shut the fuck up, Rita! I do not intend to kill us, trust me. Oh, shit! You're crazy, Legs! Legs, do not let them grab us. - Try to. Would be the use of a weapon. - I'd shoot rings out. He is right behind us! Be careful Legs! I do not think anyone died? Is anyone hurt? I call Abel SadovskГЅ the witness stand. Mr. SadovskГЅ, let me know your relationship with your daughter. I have to admit - I am not able to keep him in check. He can not be controlled. These children today... I have had to to increase her alone. Maybe things would be different if I had remarried after the death of their mother. Maybe he would not be as awkward. "Difficult?" What do you mean? Yes, we fight, we are talking about rarely, but "tricky"? That's not true. Besides, you do not even know me. What are you doing here pyhГ¤puvussasi? Everyone knows that you're a drunk.

Miss SadovskГЅ - sentence you to a minimum of 6 months in an educational institution. What is the maximum penalty? - As you decide for yourself. Judgment length is indeterminate. I can be released until the age of 18. That is, in 3 years. An adult should a more lenient sentence. It is unconstitutional children to be treated like this! We are not here to discuss the law. At the Court of Justice have no power to judge me. Is this the case? The following case. Foxfire NOT regret nothing We thought we were untouchable, invincible... We were wrong. The other, which they despise, - retaliated by ripping our hearts out of it. They took us for Legs. I still wonder the same thing: Why does society feared the 16-year-old girl? His only crime was to promise us the impossible. Why he was held as a major threat? When he left, it felt like life would have departed from us. We were on probation, and the minor, so we did not get to meet LegsiГ¤. It was the most cruelest. Is the room ready for 307? - It is. See you tomorrow. Since I did not hear his voice and the Foxfire was ice - I was not able to write a word typewriter. Hey, Mom. Look, Maddy... I do not want to bother, but is you $ 16 cash economy? It is. I promised.

Legs is not like that. those bastards censoring everything. Thank you for your warm welcome. - The girls are waiting for you. Sorry. I'm Marianne Kellogg. I would be a big sister, if you want. Convenience. Yes. What is your name? - Margaret. Nice to meet you, Margaret. Istutaanko? This must feel awkward, but we came just to talk. Thank you. Would you like chocolate? - Yes, thank you. Smells good. Do you like to read? - I like. What do you like to read? - Despite what. Comics, magazines... I mean books. Them too. Here is the library. - That's nice. I brought a couple of books, I like very much. Thank you, it was a friendly. I like especially this: " Little Women ". It tells of four with her mother resident sisters. The father is at war. The book follows the lives of girls year, from Christmas to Christmas. It says they are facing the joys and hardships. Do not worry. I'll read it. Let's talk about you. I think? - Yeah, you. What are you going to do when relieved of? I do not know even if I think about it a lot. I just know that I will never let anyone control me. It is a good decision. Do you know what he did? Something really vile. He left me when I was seven months. It is not. I know why he left. He was ashamed that's how he treated - the only people who put their trust in in him. His daughter and me. Why is he talking about this shit? To-day was supposed to celebrate. Legs was right. For lutkalla a pig snout. Damn, there he is! - Already? Legs! Oh, my God! Come on! Come on! Come on, Legs! - Come on! Come on! - Come here! Come on, Legs! All right, here we come! Legs, you got guests. I'm so glad coming, Marigold. Girls! Dempster sisters. Marigold and... What's your name again? This one. - They are also Lowertownista. Marigold and I spent time along with Red Bank. It's not always been a bed of roses dancing, or what? When did you get out of it? - About a month ago. You are definitely happy. - Of course, it is wonderful to be free. I thank the Creator for every free moment. Do you want to dance? I want to show you something. Wow. It's so beautiful. Sometimes I have been so scared - and thought, Foxfire that was just a dream. Did they hurt you? Trifle. Sometimes my eyes just start to leak. One woman did it for me. Thumb, just like that. According to Father Theriault it is because of the society. Capitalism, and because the we have to sell ourselves. But it is not the whole truth. Why does a girl have to squeeze his thumb eye? Yes, men are our enemies. But women can be. Claim to be sisters, but imisivГ¤t compared, if you would be able to. They hate without reason. They just hate. It is depressing. Those five months while you were away... It felt as if we had not lived. We do not even have been able to meet, because we thought only you - and all the horrors of that you had to endure. Not to worry. No one will hurt me. I was too clever for them. When they tried to moments, I was running away. I changed Soaring Hawk. FOR SALE Stop, stop! Where's he going? - We do not expect you to, Legs! Watch your step. The house needs renovation, but it is habitable. Wow. - Look at it. It requires a lot of work. - But we can do it. It's so big. The house is solid. It stinks. - Once we have cleaned up... Oh, how beautiful. Legs, here is beautiful. There is enough room. - This is a pigsty. Tenants left suddenly and then left the house terrible shape. But the rent is cheap. 46 bucks a month. What about the purchase price? - 3200. It can be negotiated. Why not? - Let's go upstairs. Does not make a hasty decision. But this seems like a kodiltamme. - Do not act on a whim. Come on, Muriel. - I, too, will sign the agreement - so I have the right to opinion. Do you have a comfortable experience maintenance of the house - or rent payment? Water, electricity, debris removal from. What do you do in the winter when the snow storm roaring outside? We'll be fine. With everyone's help we will be able to manage the house. Girls... you do not know anything. Changing the house is like getting married. It wants to, but all of a sudden one day wants out. Thanks for your concern, gold, but I've been thinking about this for a long time. Is that right? And since then, smart guy? - The whole fucking life. Here you go. Three months in advance. We have a house! Thought that we could afford. - Thank you! With just a small ollessain This evening, I asked, "What do I get?" " Valtaako of the seas, the richness of the country?" My mother sang just: " KenpГ¤ may know ' it ' " ken guess tomorrow " Ken found out to get you growth of its time, but seems to usher in a It's hard to know where the story begins. It's hard to go back to the top. How to find a moment, order to be able to say: " Here it is, Now can start ticking clocks "? But that spring, when the sun shining brighter than ever - we were all convinced Foxfire that the story started from the beginning. Here, in an old farm Oldwick Road, 6 km south of Hammond. Roof tiles were skewed and the facade of the weather rГ¤nsistГ¤mГ¤. But we were just as beautiful area as a proud, old schooner. Above all, it was a house that Legs chose us. It would be a - a sanctuary for all those in need for women and girls. We have about twelve bucks. It should live throughout the month. Then we will have to starve. - Get it now and then for breakfast. What's this? Legs! Where did you get them? - None of your business. No one needs to explain. Each gives as much as he can. I make a few short bit as a waiter. - Do not worry, even if not to give. I have never seen so much money. - How much is it, Lana? $ 120- and 66 cents. Unbelievable! - Let's celebrate! Now no need to go hungry. Stop it. Continue tomorrow. - Then I will not have time to write it all. What did you say? - Nothing. You said something. - No, you go to sleep. I want to sleep, girls. All right. We have a lonely feeling. Here is the top enough rooms, and yet you have to disrupt us. Come on, This is the first night. Come on, Rita! - Hey, Maddy. Make some space. Where do you want patjani? - Make Room! Good night, girls. - Good night. Look at the headlights. - I like this. Not the way it works. - I'm not wasting your time. I love this. How much? I, too, I love it. You can not afford. What about this? Beautiful, is not it? - Very nice. Come on, Goldie! Yesterday you said 400, Acey. - I would not say anything so foolish. Maybe you were drunk. - However, I would be so stupid. It is worth $ 800. What do they say? Rita? - Massaging the shops. I know who bends. Come on, Acey. 600? Okay, I can sell you a 600, respectively, sweetie. You win. You're welcome. You did not believe me. This is our car. What's it say? Look, Viscount bastards. Warm. We need a refrigerator. - We need more than that. Curtains, for example. - And the food. Lots of food. - Steaks. I need gas. I know how it is stolen. Whoa! But you forget the most important: Beer and cigarettes! - And the grass! Yes, grass! - We should draw up a budget. Here we go again. - We need a plan to survive. We did not survive, but the good life. We deserve it. That's right! Give it to me. Come on! Not vice versa, otherwise it will not fit! I told you! Do you see? Do you swear that you own your life Foxfire - sisters? - Yes. That you follow the world view? - Yes. Rather die than fail? - Yes, I swear. Welcome to Foxfire, Agnes. You can get help with family responsibilities. Then you get to know it all. He is accustomed to household work. I have taken care of when I got into married laundry, food, cleaning... In addition, he had to make mulkeromiehensГ¤ brothers housework. Is Lana explained how we conduct our financial affairs? It's not a problem. I do not earn much, but their pleasure. What did you do windows? - Board up the gap. We had no alternative. - Let's not talk about it. Agnes greeted with a welcome. You asked. In our time, ceremonies were formalized. Everyone does not seem to have to go work in the morning! Is this ekaa 3 months? - Revenue barely cover costs. Although we have not used any money for the renovation of the house. Juurija just survive. And the biggest expense for rent, is the food. Hell. Sorry. Will improve the situation of the new girls? - Our income is quite deplorable. Only two of us working, or three, including Agnes. We do not do not worry about the girls income. I never said that. You do so, but you were kind to Agnes because you know his way in the high seas. You just do not get it. Wake up! Wake up now, Maddy! Violet, out of bed! Get up, everybody! " Money, money, money!" That's the word echoes in my head. Ding, dong! Awake! Goldie! It is the only word that I hear. Arise, Marcia! Listen to me! Wake up, Lana! I dreamed of it for me. We have to find a solution. Together. But we're just arguing from cereals to and - butter and broken windows. It is ridiculous. Legs, calm down... - Worrier makes me nervous! Worry is useless. It chokes me! I want you to speak. I want us to come up with ideas. I do not want us to be of little girls who are afraid of the punishment. We can do anything. Foxfire flame does not go out ever. Seeking money from where it is: Men's pockets. That money belongs to us. Is this sufficient? - For some more along the edges. Show. A little uneven. - Adding to that a little bit. Perfect. May I join you? - Please. I'm Jerry. - I'm Elaine. You are too kind. - A young woman's does not belong to walk home alone. I'm over there. No trouble at all. It is the journey along the way.

Does your wife that you kiss girls? - Take my wallet. And a clock. - And the ring. Thank you. In explaining to the wife. - Hello! Come on! I'm so proud of you, Rita. It went really well. I sat alone in the diner, and I saw a man coming in to. looked at each other and he came to me. The guy was piss pants. - I wish I'd been there. You still get your chance. Do not you afraid of? - No, he was very nice. And the time komeakin. You are too dependent on men. if man touches me, whip him. They are pink flee when they see you. - I do not care. I do not need men. In that case, you can not be the bait. - Sooner than I hook the bait. Stop it already. Today we celebrate. Rita. - Rita! NO NO So, on behalf of three and eight against. Even hypocrites. You do not get qualified Marigold because he is black. We did not because of it. I do not have nothing against niggers. Then what's the problem? Vote for him just because that he is a friend? Foxfire does not work that way. Are you comfortable expert? You just joining us. You think you're Foxfire torchbearer? The cleanest of all? Will we allow Snow White to come here as if he were part of the family? You make me sick. You think you're better than blacks. So I imagine. Fuck you, SadovskГЅ! Fuck you! I'll drive you back.

Nicely said. You'll love that place. I go there often with the mother. Let's go for this. Shortcut. There's no doubt about it, Margaret. Couple of years, you are beautiful. - Why did a couple of years? You're pretty young, are not you? Parents to know where you are? This way, no problem. Do not be afraid. We both know what you are. You are a runaway child who is flirting with strangers. Do not. Not to worry. Do not you know that it is dangerous play with fire? What a little bitch. You know that it is dangerous. No!

Take this. Daddy will get you. Daddy's going to get you! Do not try to escape! Where do you think you're going? I told you, that daddy will get you. All the memories from this period are obscure. My notes were just tuherruksia. Loose fragments, as the author would have been suspended. Legs bought weapons from Acey Holman. In order to protect us, he said. In order to escape the bus man like incidents. But we felt that something else was going on. Legs was like a shooting star, always in motion. And we were like a comet in the wake of a rotating space dust. Only he knew where he was on the way. And we followed. None of us knew, what he was planning. I can not do this. Weapons terrible to me. Violet, you try, I'll try later. It's not that hard. Wild attracted many travel - but I'm not involved in it. Perhaps my desire to own, - or perhaps in order to avoid other suspect eyes. I did not know at the time, I was scared. Marianne and I we wanted to shops - but Whitney wanted a place in Astoria, Steinway to visit the museum. We had to look at the three pianos days. - I got it. Marianne here. I was afraid you no longer would play. It's nothing. It is a thing of the past. Not to worry. I put everything in its place, they did not notice anything. Let's not talk about it anymore. You are still welcome. So, the church. Dad would love to meet you. I will be happy, Marianne. I do not know how to thank you. But I have to ask for service. I want to invite a friend. He is so glum and lonely. Mother died of cancer last year. She is a good girl. You will not be disappointed. See you on Sunday. Bye. Honey, you sit over there. I do not think it is too long? - Of course not. Veronica, sit next to me. Davis, take a seat next to the end. Claire can not sit next to you. Father, you know your place. Sit down, please. Thank you. Davis, Claire, Susan, I want to introduce Marianne's fantastic friends. Veronica and Margaret. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Some reach the top, some do not. You do not have to eat it all. I ate only half. Why others do not reach the top? Maybe they do not want? It is a mystery. Is not it, girls? Probably. What are your your future plans? After studying accounting, I would like to open their own beauty salons. To succeed, must be their own boss. What do you wish 're doing, Veronica? I would like to work with Margaret. - Beauty Salon. You'd fit mainoskasvoiksi. Before that, I need a job. Office work, for example. Is not it, Margaret? - Yes, any work invalid. Those who really want and believe in themselves, and of course the Lord - reach the target, for the Lord will help them, - who help themselves. I like you because you have dignity. Of the social needs. All grizzly, demanding rights. Society is full of parasites. Communists supported by the trade unions require sick leave. They want to recruit sick being. Can you believe it? Pay me, I fell down drunk on the machine. This is the plot. They want to crush us. The Communists are the problem. Communism is like the plague - and it will destroy the foundation of our society. It is like a cancer. Here we go again. But I did not argue. Leikkaanko cake? - Yes. Veronica, are you writing machine? - Yes, I like it. Treasury would need to two stenographer. How can we thank you? - Give thanks to Marianne. I can not promise anything, but I'll call as soon as I can. Thank you for letting us come. - It was a pleasure to meet you both. They are awesome. The man is comfortable. I had a great time. Did you? I do not know... They are comfortable, and the... Marianne and Mrs. Kellogg wanted we need to feel at home. Shut the fuck up. Million, we could pay all your debts and bills. The coming. One of the big show, and we can stop. You are the only one who opposes it. We voted in favor. - I do not like it. The acquisition of the weapons... I'm not asking you to to use a gun. I just want that you are involved planning. You must enter the full the ransom letter. We may need more than one - so that we can avoid last-minute panic and cottage. Only you will be able to write it the right way. That's bullshit. You do not need me anymore. That's not true. - Do not argue. You sit in a movie theater in the back row. I saw you. You suutelitte. What are you talking? - Collis Connors. It's an ice cream vendor. - It's cute, dark-haired boy? It is endowed with a soft voice? - Stop it. I do not care about him. You do not, huh? As you 're going to see siirappisia love movies. Are you one of the calf? Go to hell. Is it true that Rita? Is it true? It is. We went in three of date. Trifle. He's nice. - It's not a big deal. I'm so sorry. I do not do it again, I swear. It would be best. You will have to distinguish. It is sufficient, W! No need to revise the rules. Shut the fuck up. W is even in the right opinion. What about equality? Agnes, Patty, Jennie, Toy and I are new - but we took an oath. What about the then even though you are one of the oldest. so what Even if you draft your rules. Maybe someone should from time to time to remind you of them. You need us. We have new blood. Sacrifice my life for you anytime. Right now, compliance with the rules is more important than ever. Before us will not be easy. We have to trust each other, otherwise it all goes to hell. So from now on: No more lies, no more secrets, and stretching the rules. And is no longer one of the oldest. We are here together. We are all Foxfire. That's it. All right, baby. If you want to leave, - differ from Foxfire, so I understand. I can get others to accept it. But... Where do I go? 13 SEPTEMBER 1966: The OUTPUT. TODAY I have to leave the farm. Now, as we approach the end of the year, I find it hard to continue. Not because I was losing Legs forever - but more importantly, Foxfire in violation of the oath - I decided not to help. I have been loyal to the decisive moment. I was forced to leave the area. Others wanted an explanation - Legs but sure did not have to defend. I avoided the formal procedure, which would have ended the trial. Expulsion would have been unbearable. He was broken, but let me go. I had to promise that I would reveal Foxfire plans. My memory was that Rita separated by a couple of days before me. But the notes from the He was still there when I left. It's funny, because I do not remember it. He was fired a week later Collis did not leave because of Connor. Their relationship had changed serious. These are the last notes. It is for events after I got to know only after many years.
