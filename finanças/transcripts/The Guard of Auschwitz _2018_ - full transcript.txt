Hey! Halt! What are you doing up there? Would you like to join us? The Fuhrur tells us, "Be swift as greyhounds, "as tough as leather, and as hard as Krupp steel." You are the future of Germany. The next 1,000 year Reich depends on you. - I promise. - I promise. To always do my duty in the Hitler Youth. To always do my duty in the Hitler Youth. Out of love and loyalty. Out of love and loyalty. To the Fuhrer, the flag, and the fatherland. To the Fuhrer, the flag, and the fatherland. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Don't be afraid. Hitler is our friend. Week on week, I see you sitting here. This is your chance to be somebody, your chance to be part of something amazing. The Fuhrer cares for us. Just come to one session. New boys are joining every week as you have seen. Here. Next week. If you don't want to, just return the uniform. I am sure you would look very smart. I'm sorry I couldn't be with you today, Hans. Oh father, please don't apologize. The Fuhrer's work is important, and I would hate to think you would stop your war efforts just for my drawing. Architecture, what an achievement. - I am very proud. - And I am proud of you. You are an inspiration. We all have a love for the Fuhrer, although, I don't agree with everything he stands for. Your mother tells me of your wonderful job offers. It's a great opportunity. Make good use of it. You are a very talented young man, Hans. - Thank you. - It's an easy choice. There's nothing more typical than an elder with such a view. Father, over 900,000 Hitler Youth attended the rally. Hitler Youth are not supposed to cry, but the emotion, the dedication for our leader, some could not control themselves. We are very lucky to have such a great leader and we must do all we can to succeed the 1,000 year Reich. I will give my life to the Fuhrer. I understand the importance here, but there is a time and a place and this is neither. You are here to celebrate your achievements, Hans. As we thank the Fuhrer for all his kindness, we need to remember what we need to celebrate as a family. I am very proud of you Hans. Well done. And I will say this, without the help from the Fuhrer, we would not have been able to afford such an amazing education. So, we wish you all the very best for the future, Hans. To Hans, the architect. The architect. Heil Hitler. Do you remember your mother's chicken soup? I am trying to now. One day, we'll be evacuated from here, to a better place, with plenty of food and a warm fire. I hope so. Do you trust them? We can start a new life for ourselves, have a family. Trust? I'm not sure I trust the Nazis after the way they have treated us. But, we can only hope. We may be here forever. Why wait to start our family? Everything in good time, my love. To start a family now doesn't seem like the right thing to do. Would you like to have been raised here? I know I wouldn't. We are not victims, Helena. Everything we own has been taken from us, but they cannot remove our souls. They cannot take away my right to listen to Verdi or to feel the summer sun on my face. When we wake in the dark and hear the shouts and laughter of the guards and the barking of the dogs, I know you are scared. I feel your heartbeat. I see your tears. Helena, one morning they will come for us, and we will gather at the cemetery with the others and be taken to that place beyond these walls, but, I will hold you, Helena, and I will protect you. And with my last breath, I will love you. Now, eat. Now, you can build us a new home, with a bigger garden and a playhouse for Greta. I will start right away. Heil Hitler. Get out! You will be reunited with your things very soon. We will take you to accommodation now, where you will rest and eat. Men and women to separate accommodation. Move. Follow the orders we give you and you will be treated well. Follow the bellboy. He will make you comfortable. Move! Snell, move! Now, move. Move! So, this is the architect you told me so much about. He looks like an idiot. Are you sure he can help us? Oh, he is wasted in the tower. This is Hans, very talented. Show him, show your drawing. This is very good, very impressive. You're right Franz, he is wasted in the crow's nest. Although, it's a little elaborate for these leeches. But better too much than not enough, right? Drink. You refuse a drink from me? - No, sir, I um, um, you... - Eh, eh, eh. Relax. I won't hurt you. Not unless you're a Jew. You're not a Jew, are you? No, sir. Do you enjoy your post in the tower? Enjoy? I enjoy the prospects of the Fatherland and the vision of the Fuhrer. But, I feel yes, maybe I could do more. I was thinking of applying for a transfer, to the front. No, no, I have a job for you, very important, direct from the top, to improve sanitation. - Prost. - Prost. Look at them. All the same. Same eyes, noses, shape of head. Parasites on the Fatherland. That's what sets us apart. I'll never get used to that smell. What would you like me to design here? Well as you can hear, there are new arrivals day and night. We need a facility where we can process efficiently on a larger scale. But, don't build me a cathedral, just a simple factory of destruction. Do you think you're up to that task? Yes, sir. We will give you everything you need, but, word of advice. Choose the fattened workers. The thin ones, they're only good for making tea and target practice. You've been given a position of trust, and your superior officer speaks very highly of your abilities. Do not disappoint me. I have a list of tradesmen who can assist you. Come. Which one of you parasites stole this? - You look guilty. - Sir. - What are you doing? - It's mine, sir. I must have dropped it. My mother made it for me, something from home. What are you even doing here? Mistakes happen. The selection process is very difficult. There are so many of you. I apologize on behalf of my colleagues. If you are hungry, eat. And if they are here in the morning, this pig sty will smell worse than it already does. Wipe it. Thank you gentlemen. - There are no losers here. - Oh, really? I won this yesterday and Hans the day before. The losers are the pig Jews. Tomorrow, we play with their diamonds. He shit them out. He picked them out his shit. I took them before he swallowed again. How can you eat your own shit? I hope you washed your hands. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler! Hans? I see you have a new friend. Klaus? He can be a very angry man. But you will have a great time with him. He's on a diet these days. He's down to 20 a day. 20? - 20 what? - Jews. He used to kill many more when he first arrived. He must be bored. Not now, he has you building his new gas chamber. He can come off his diet. I hear hundreds a day. It's very impressive. By the way they are arriving, I do not think it will be big enough. The light? This is very good, I'm impressed. Thank you sir. Will you need my services further? Of course. I want you to oversee the build, make sure it's how it should be. - You will need a work force. - I see. You can choose from many at your disposal. You will need their numbers and their occupations, they are deceitful. If a farmer tells you he's an electrician, if he cannot do the job, you must shoot him on the spot. I will choose carefully. Take your time. Whoever you choose will be isolated and killed on completion. Men and women? Why would you need a woman? Purely on occupation. If you should need one, she should not be alone with the men. They breed like rabbits. Helena. And so, although I am SS, I will treat you with respect, the best I can. I am of course under the command of my superiors and need to produce a product for them regardless of opinion from you or I. A sanitization room to clean and refresh the inmates of the lice and diseases. Yes Helena. I am a seamstress. What use is a seamstress here? I cannot understand why you have chosen me. Do you want me to sew something? Everyone here has a use. Some here are qualified plumbers, builders, electricians, and others are here to assist. You are here to assist, and you can help out with the materials that need to be on site, paperwork, whilst I concentrate on the construction with Rueben here, who is a building engineer. Was a building engineer. It is very hard to work when we are being pushed around. - The best you can, you said? - What is the problem? Animals, water, get the water. What is going on here? Laziness will not be tolerated. He is hurt. Oh, I see. Was he of importance to you? He is an engineer, of much value yes. He is of no value now. You, outside. I hope you are not getting to close to your workforce. Have you forgotten what we are here for? We are trying to rid this world of the bad, the weak and the crippled. If you commit treason, I will personally kick away the stool. Do you understand? Sir. Your choice of workforce, it concerns me. You, you, come here. Shoot her. Shoot her or I will hang you. Shoot her. Good. See, now, just go and get yourself a strong one, a new one. I think the sun's coming out. Hans, what are you doing out here? We have diamonds to win. No teeth tonight. I'll be in in a moment. I'm just getting some air. Air? The air is full of Jew my friend. Come inside. What are you looking for? Nothing. Do you ever get the feeling of dread? Dread? Well, I'm not sure that it's dread that I feel but maybe more that I worry about the way that I feel now, happy with my life. I worry that it will change, that it will end. Oh, my dear boy. Ever since you were small, you have always looked for the light in the darkness, always bringing home stray dogs, birds if they'd fallen from their nest. Some people will live happy forever, but some people will always search for more. Of course, there will be problems on the way, but we're in safe hands. Your future is going to be all that you have wished for and more. This is very good. You are very talented. Thank you. Is it a bank? No. What then? Somewhere all Nazis will live one day, somewhere to reflect, retirement. Reflect, on all of this you mean? Yes, somewhere to make sense of why this has happened, of why you are here and not out there raising a family. I wanted to fight for my country, serve the Fuhrer in battle against the enemy. But my father, to protect me from death, convinced me to come here, here, to this horror. I never thought I would question why I wear this uniform, but I do. Do you not question why you are here? Why I am here? I am here 'cause I am a Jew! Because the Jews ruled the world. We stole life from the Germans, their money, jewels. It must be true, no? If not, how can any of this be legal? To kill every Jew, men, woman, and children, innocent apart from the crime of religion, of being different. For me to think otherwise would be one thing, but for me to act in a way to prevent what my country believes is the solution would be treason, punishable by death. Please, don't misunderstand me. I care for you, I care for your future, for my future. I'm not sure I can do that any other way. This isn't easy for me. Not easy, for you? I have lost everything. I do not know whether my husband, Samuel, is alive or dead. I go to sleep heartbroken. I wake up feeling the same way. You see this? I eat out of it. I wash in it, I use it as a toilet. So, I am sorry, but I don't see how this is hard for you. Your father was right in what he did. He chose to protect you, but at some stage you have to take responsibility for your own actions. How so? You are fed, watered. No one is pointing a gun at you, threatening your life, your sanity. The risk of death for you is non-existent. - Do you know what this is? - No. Cyanide. I almost took it last night, so you see death is closer for me than you think. I would much prefer a gun to be pointed at me rather than feel what I feel right now. You have all of our possessions. You have the power over our lives, you have it all. We have nothing and we would not use this to die. You do not have the right. None of you have the right to decide whether you live or die. We must keep fighting to survive, and so must you. Why would you say that to a member of the SS? Surely you want all of us to die, to suffer a painful death. That is the difference between me and you. If I wanted you to suffer, to feel pain beyond the physical, then I would be just like you, just like the SS themselves. It would not feed my heart to wish hurt to strangers. I just want the right to live my life, to see the green fields again, to breathe air that is not full of a thousand screaming souls. You need to survive this to remember for the rest of your life, the choices that you made. No! I'm sorry, I didn't mean. I'm sorry too. I'm not like the others. I'm just an architect who wants to design buildings, not, not sanitation rooms. Sanitation rooms? You want me to believe what you are saying? Then you must believe it yourself. Gas chambers, torture rooms, target practice, we both know what we are building here. Is Germany short on soldiers that you have to be here? I have a choice, yes, but I want to serve my country. I know nothing else. From a young age, this is all I have known. I don't know what is right anymore. I will step into sanitation one day. Is that right? You act as if you care what happens to me. I do. How many Jews have you killed? Honestly, how many? I have killed. I am a soldier, I follow orders. If I do not, I will be killed. I have to follow orders. But never think that I do not care. - Prove it to me. - Prove what? Prove that you care. Save one, if not from the SS, then from the pain, come with me. Helena wait, don't do anything stupid. You will get yourself killed. One, just save one. Look at this man, he is beyond saving. He might as well be dead already. Would you rather be dead, or left to die like this? This is a human being. Just like you and your Fatherland. Do you see your people suffer like this in this way? We do, we see it every day. We are forced to help, - everyday. - None of this is my choice. Now, I suggest you get back to work. Look at this. You know, one of them walked up to me the other day and said, "Why us? "Why are your people doing this to us? "We are starving, tortured." So, what did you say to him? Nothing, I shot him in the head. How many gold teeth do you have? None. Neither do I. They stole from Germans and Germans are just taking back what is rightfully theirs. Simple subtraction, extraction, all in the nature of selection. Careful. They might bite. The man, where is he? - The hanging Jew? - Yes. I saved him from the torture, but I could not save his life. Saved is not quite the term I would use, but he is free from this place now. Thank you. I wish I could actually save someone and for them to still be alive. But it's just not possible, you know this. In the gas chambers and crematoriums, there are over 100 Jews. The sonderkommando who assist only four German SS officers to carry out the executions. I would be outnumbered by the people I was trying to save. You make it sound like the sonderkommando Jews want to help the SS. They are forced to kill their people, forced to drag, burn, and bury. Sometimes they have to carry out these terrible acts on their own family, just to survive this place, in the hope that they will be spared or rescued. It's a mess. Maybe not save, maybe you could protect. Believe it or not I am already trying to do that. I looked for you on the registers to enlist for this build workforce. Because? Because I felt something in my soul when I saw you, something that halted my aggression, the aggression my country wants me to have and have been trained for as an SS soldier. My training was supposed to filter such emotion. Something inside told me how wrong this is. I have argued with my father for years and agreed with Hitler. My father is a good man, but he is still a servant of the Fuhrer. I saw a kindness in your eyes, that I'd not seen in an SS before. Six months ago I was in the ghetto, removed from my happy life as a free Jew. We were still caged in the walls of the ghetto. We survived the evacuation, but the poverty. My husband Samuel provided for me, loving me every day. The conditions were appalling. Our first child-... I didn't realize you had children. I don't. But? How can this be? Was it an SS? When I first arrived, it was hardly visible. Even naked, it was hard to see. I've been hiding it ever since. I get thinner but my bump becomes more enlarged. Nobody knows, and now I'm telling an SS. But I can't hide it for much longer without help. Will you help me? Will you help us? I have a few months to construct this building but by this time you will have given birth. We must give this life a chance. We must at least try. The war may be over by then. - How's the progress? - Heil Hitler! This needs to move quicker. Sir, I with respect, I need some more men, men that haven't been here too long. I have several ready. You want me to bring you stronger ones. Can I see the list of inmates? I've told you, you can take as many as you need, whoever you want, but no more women. Come here, come here! We need this one. She will keep the men pig Jews amused. It's a tactic we all know and love. She cannot stay here alone with the men. They will multiply. She can stay here, but under your supervision. No fucking, you understand? I know how they work. One after the other. Vermin. Stinking vermin. The last thing we need is more of these rats. Very good. You did that very naturally. I think he believed you. I think I believed you. What is your husband's full name? This must be a proud moment for you, showers with no fresh water, and a hatch with no fresh air. - Why did you bring me here? - We have been through this. - These are my people. - I have a visitor for you. My Helena. How did you hide this? If they knew, they would kill you. Hans tells me he is looking after you. There isn't much time. There is something you need to know. What is it? Block 14 B, it's, block 14 B, it's marked for the gas chamber tomorrow. It's already on the register. I can try and say we need him here, but it may be too suspicious. You cannot die, no. Block 14 B is for the men that refuse the sonderkommando post. Why did you refuse? I cannot help them kill my own people. He was lucky. Lucky, lucky he's in this hell? He normally would have been hung or shot. It was only because many of the men refused. They killed seven of them and decided the gas chamber was the quickest and easiest way. This cannot be, you can't. You cannot. Samuel, I love you. I will take care of them both. I need to get you back to your block. The others will notice you are gone. I will give you a few minutes alone, but please don't be too long. I have loved you from the moment I saw you. Samuel you are my heart and soul. Until my last breath, Helena, until my last breath. Thank you. What do you imagine they're thinking? Move! It's nearly time. When your waters break, send for me. Everything will be fine. I will bring clean cloth and water. How will I feed my baby? You must breastfeed. I will bring you beetroot juice. We must keep you strong. This child will be born into this life fighting, I know. Try to get rest. And this will be fully operational in 10 days? So as your Jews have made such a good job of it, I think they should be the first to try it. I think they would not have it any other way. Stand up! What's so funny? She took a beating. Sweep, Jew. Very good. The Fuhrer will be proud of you. I'm sorry. Okay, okay. Alright. Okay. Lie down. I won't be long. Please, keep the noise to a minimum. I will get some help. Hurry. My Samuel should be here. Keep Helena quiet. Shh, shh, shh, shh. You have a beautiful boy. Samuel, your father would have loved you more than you could ever know. I must go now. Feed the child, you will know when. - Can you stay? - I must go. You must keep him as quiet as possible. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh. What is this? Father, I can't kill these people without remorse. Son, I understand. But this? A baby needs to be warm. Give. Thank you father. I never wanted this for you. Why am I here? Your talent was as an architect, not a murderer. Nothing would change your mind. Hitler Youth was your life. I couldn't just leave you fighting at the front like some pawn in a game of chess, which you were fixated. Nothing else mattered. This is not what I wanted for you. It is my duty to serve Hitler and the Fatherland. But you have so much more to give. Your architecture, you're a very talented boy. After the war I will pursue my career. But for now, my country needs me as an SS officer. You must see that. All I see is anger and manipulation of people, a man who trades on fear, ignorance, hatred. But you put yourself in danger too. But I don't want to put you in danger. Look, I can get you a position where I am posted. You would still be serving the Fatherland. It would be good to work with you father. I will arrange it, but I think it would be wise to keep our relationship a secret. The fact that you are my son could cause problems for both of us and make it difficult for me to protect you. I don't need protecting father. No no, I know you don't. Now take your time. The fish will tire. Sometimes in life you have to be patient and wait for what you want. You have to wait a bit longer. I will try again father. We must move quicker. We will fire up the new crematorium and the gas chamber. There must not be a shred of evidence. I think Hans should have the privilege of seeing the result of his good work. We can gas hundreds every hour after removal of the cadavers. If we get this right, we can clear the evidence and the camp within six weeks. The trains will be full today. We must destroy as many as possible or all this will have been a waste of time. We do not have six weeks. - Halt! - It's me you fucking idiot! - Heir commandant! - Hans, where have you been? Some final checks in the gas chamber. - Special delivery for you. - Heir commandant? Because of your efforts, you have earned the privilege of administering the gas. We need to clean up this camp very quickly. Something I do when I'm walking past the Jews, just, just for fun. It's a joke. Don't drop those. We need every last granule. What is this? It's Franz. Open the door please. The Soviet army is getting closer. Klaus has ordered more marches. What is this? Zyclon B. Gas? Yes. It's time. Hans, what is to happen to my son? We could hide him. For how long? How long before he is dragged out and drowned or ripped up by the dogs? We can protect you both, so that you can be with each other. We can do that. Such innocence and light in this darkness. Why do you have the gas, why? And why if you are his father don't you do something to help him? I can do nothing. While the Russians are coming, Hitler's demands are becoming more erratic. Helena, they will kill everyone, prisoners, everyone who stands in their way. There's no way out. - Why do you have the gas? - He can do nothing, Helena. Why? I am to be the executioner. I'm sorry. You tried to help me. I am grateful of that. I will end the darkness with my son. He came into this life with me. He leaves this life with me. I need something from you. - What? - Cyanide. Give me the cyanide. It is not for me, it's for you. You must live. You must remember this, these walls, this horror, the choices you made. It was our destiny. We did what we could. Your father would have loved you more than you will ever know. - The day we were dreading. - This horror could not go on. There is only one thing I am sorry about. We did not finish the job. We will hang. We will. What are you doing? Sometimes you have to be patient and wait for what you want. Eyes, nose, shape of head, parasites on the fatherland. I just want the right to live my life, to see the green fields again. Your father would have loved you more than you could ever know. I eat out of it, I wash in it, I use it as a toilet. So I am sorry, but I don't see how this is hard for you. I worry about the way that I feel now, happy with my life. I worry it will change, that it will end. A sanitization room, to clean and refresh the inmates of lice and diseases. This is very good. You are very talented. You need to survive this, to remember for the rest of your life, the choices that you made. Sanitation rooms? You want me to believe what you are saying? Then you must believe it yourself. Gas chambers, torture rooms, target practice, we both know what we are building here. Why? I am to be the executioner. It's for you. You must live. You must remember these walls, this horror, the choices you made. Shoot her. - Shoot her. - I won't. Shoot her. Your talent was an architect, not a murderer. Nothing would change your mind. Hitler Youth was your life. Is it a bank? - No. - What then? Somewhere all Nazi's will live one day. Somewhere to reflect. Retirement. Reflect, on all of this you mean? Yes, somewhere to make sense of why this has happened.
