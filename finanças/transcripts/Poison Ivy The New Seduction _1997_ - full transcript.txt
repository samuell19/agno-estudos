Captioning made possible by new line home video game 3 of the 1985 series is just under way with Kansas City trailing by one. The first pitch by will cone is hit on the ground towards second base! Wexler's got it! Fires to first, and they've quickly got one out. In 1985, his average was 250 for the season. Mom? Hi, darling. Hi. This is for your tea party. Thank you. Go on and play now, girls. Mama's got work to do. Ivy, go take your sister upstairs. Come on, Violet. O.K. Let's go get joy. Would you like any tea, Madeline? O.K. Careful, it's hot. There you go, and a cookie. Can you play, joy? Mm-hmm, come on. O.K. Oh, goodie... Tea. You pour some more tea, Violet. Daddy's home, joy. There's gonna be fireworks. Catherine? Honey. [Moaning] Hah! Who the fuck are you? Don't! Look, man, i don't want to fight you. All right? Just get the hell out! Becca? Go. Baby, let me get you some ice for that. Ivan, wait! You don't understand! Ivan, please, would you listen to me? How many others, Rebecca, how many others?! Grocery boy? The mailman? How many? And in my house! You think that this is easy, sneaking around on your wife and pretending that there's nothing between us? Catherine. You're home. How long... Have you been sleeping with my husband right here... In my own house? Ivan, tell her to get out. Ivan, tell her. Ivan! Ivan! Where are you going? [Door closes] Whore. I am not a whore. Then what are you? He told me what you're like between the sheets. Is it any wonder he needs a woman? It's happening again. Oh, no. I'm giving you 20 minutes to get out of this house. And if you're not gone, i will call the police and have you removed. Violet, take Madeline. Bye. Bye. I'll try to write to you. Thanks. May i help you? Hi. Yes, um... Is this still the greers' residence? Yes, it is. I'm here to see joy. Mm-hmm. May i tell her who's calling? Violet? Violet! I can't believe it's you. I can't believe it's you. Oh, thank you, Mrs. b. It's hard to believe that it's been 11 years. Daddy refuses to believe I'm not 10 years old anymore. Um... I just moved back here from Arizona. I thought maybe I'd get a waitressing job part-time and maybe start some summer classes at the junior college. That's wonderful. It makes me long to be 20 again. Being 20 is hard. Not as hard as being 8. But then, life wasn't meant to be easy, was it? Have you found an apartment? Not yet. But i put my name up on the board at school. Why not stay here? I... i couldn't. Joy: But we have so much room. It's really not a problem. Joy, can i have a word with you in the kitchen, please? Come here, you crap. Joy, having Violet stay here is out of the question. Why? Well, for many reasons. It's been a long time. Things have changed. Dad, Violet was my best friend. When she and Ivy were here it was like having sisters. Seeing her today was like nothing had changed. I know that, sweetheart, but where is she going to sleep? We have an extra bedroom. That was your mother's room, joy. I know that. What do you think, Mrs. b? Oh. Maybe the girl could use a helping hand, if you know what i mean. I promised you we'd be home again. Welcome home, Madeline. 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93... 94, 95... [Knocking on door] Just a minute. 97, 98, 99, 100. Violet? Oh, my gosh. [Music playing] I'm supposed to be in training. You must be good. I'm proud of you. Who is this? Michael. Joy: We're going to get married. Married? In the fall. Daddy wants us to wait, but Michael wants me to apply for a transfer to Yale so we can be together next year. Yale? Is that far away? Connecticut, silly. Michael will be home from school next week. I can't wait for you to meet him. He's very good-looking. Remember when we were little and we used to dress up like we were brides? You made a veil out of a petticoat. And you made one out of a whole roll of toilet paper. What about your dad? What's he going to do when you get married? I don't know. Sometimes I'm afraid he'll end up alone. He doesn't date? There's a woman named Gwen he talks about. Mrs. b and i keep hoping he'll find the time to ask her out. It wouldn't bother you if he got serious or anything? Why should it? He's been alone a long time. He deserves to be with someone nice. But i don't think he'll ever get over my mother. I mean, you've probably noticed how her room is still the same. After all these years, dad still can't bring himself to change it. You must really miss her, too. I do. A lot. I really need her sometimes. Violet. Hello? Violet? Connecticut? [Hums] [Humming] [Whispering] No, thank you, Mrs. b. So how's Yale this year, Michael? Um, good, sir. I'm, uh, developing some important relationships. Good. Michael's fourth in his class this year. That's very impressive for freshman year. It's very impressive for any year. So, Michael, we're looking forward to having you at the bank this summer. We'll see you on Monday? Absolutely. I'm looking forward to it. Good. You've got the house to yourselves tonight because I've... Got a meeting. Got a meeting. That's right. Good night, dad. Good night. Good night, sir. Good night, Michael. It's party time. Michael, you should have been at the club for drinks. There's some new blood. All in good time, my brother. All in good time. Scott, what's up? How's Princeton? O.K. The classes or the girls? To, uh... Uncompromising women. Hear, hear. So i hear you're tearing up the courts. Got my last division 1 tournament on Friday. Then it's hello Ivy league. If i win. No ifs. You're in your prime. Jaimie, am i right? We have lived on that court for the past 2 months. If she could eat and sleep out there, that's where we'd be right now. You're Violet, right? What are you doing this summer? She's taking classes at the junior college. Ooh! The junior college. My maid took English classes there. Is it a... a... tough school to get into? Oh, no. They'll accept just about anybody... As long as your welfare check doesn't bounce. Ooh! [Giggling] Um... No, thanks. Violet? No. I have to go to work. Right now? Yeah. I, um... I drew the late shift tonight. You know, new kid on the block and all. Well... See ya. Whoa! Baby! You guys leave her alone. She's had it pretty tough. What was she doing here in the first place? Her mother was... Their maid. She was my best friend. [Giggling] [Laughing and talking] Shh! Shh! [Creak] Shh... [Clock tolls] [Kissing sounds] Michael! Stop it! Damn it, joy, what's the matter now? I told you. I have a lot on my mind. I have an early practice tomorrow. I'm just not in the mood. If your mother was this uptight, no wonder your dad fooled around. How dare you say that to me. I confided in you about that. I can't believe you would throw it in my face. Look, I'm sorry. How about i come by after your practice tomorrow, o.K.? [Creak] Oh! My god. You think it was daddy? You scared me half to death. Hmm. That's some... That's some outfit there. Where did you say you worked again? Denny's. In Hollywood. It's, um, under new management. I, um... I guess I've never eaten there before. Would you like to? [Giggles] You should see the look on your face. Look, um, it's kinda late. I... i gotta go. Hmm. Come on. It's a joke. Look... I, um... I think we got off to a bad start. Hmm. I see we have a little unfinished business. Stock market's up. Mmm... And i see we're a major stockholder. Violet: Mmm... [Knock on door] Just a minute! Come in. Oh, hi. Hi. I wanted to apologize for my friends tonight. They can be pretty annoying sometimes. Don't worry about it. Didn't bother me. Well, it bothered me. I'm sorry. Can i talk to you about something? Sure. You never get... Urges or anything? I do. A lot. But when it comes down to it, i just... Get tense. I don't even want him inside me. I've never had an orgasm with him. I've never even... Had an orgasm. I think my mother was the same way. I mean, she did sleep in this room most of the time. What if I'm just like her? The first time i was with a guy... I was 13. I was known as the school slut by the time i was 14. But then i got smart. I stopped going to school. Excuse me. Where did you get that? This? Why? Well, it doesn't belong to you. Now how would you know that? Because it belonged to Mrs. greer! Well, she's not using it, is she? More coffee, Mr. greer? Uh... No. No, thank you, Mrs. b. O.K. "Dearest joy, "I've kicked. I'm clean. "I'm ready to make amends for all the hurt I've laid on you. Love, Michael." So... Old Michael had a little drug problem, did he? [Car horn honks] [Loud music plays] That honking for you? Yeah, it's jaimie. We've got a practice doubles match. When will you be back? Probably late. I was kinda hoping we could spend the day together. Oh. I've gotta practice. The last division 1 tournament is the day after tomorrow. I gotta win. You don't gotta win, joy. Oh, yes, i do. You know, you're really hard on yourself. You don't have to be perfect all the time. If i were perfect, i wouldn't have to work twice as hard as everyone else, would i? Hey, jaimie and i will be practicing here this afternoon. You should come watch. [Honk] [Honk honk] Oh, goody. What are you doing? [Gasps] Well, in case you hadn't noticed, i am the housekeeper here. This is what i do. Well, i would appreciate it if, from now on, you'd let me know when you're going to come in my room. [Beep beep beep] [Beep beep beep] [Beep beep beep] [Beep beep beep] [Beep beep beep] [Beep beep beep] [Beep beep beep] Larry's been a naughty boy. Hi. My time is your time. Where do you want to meet? What are you in the mood for? That'll cost extra, you know. O.K. Really? They didn't tell me that. I can't believe that happened. That's crazy. Jaimie, i need to play a real set. In a minute, o.K.? Jaimie, you're supposed to be my training partner. All right, all right. I'm coming. I'm gonna go get a drink. Do you want anything? Anything. Just hurry up. O.K. Listen, i have to go, o.K.? No, really. I have to go. Hey. You guys look like you could use something cold to drink. Excellent! Throw it in the blender. Add a little ice, and you got yourselves something tropical. A little extra kick never hurt. I suppose not. [Laughing] Oops! Ha ha ha! Oops! Ha ha ha! Jaimie! What did you put in those drinks? The teeniest shot of rum. Ha ha! I swear... The teeniest! Play to win, ladies. [Drops racquet] Joy. I don't believe it. Come on, joy. Joy, sit up. Joy. Hey, there. What's goin' on? They're... They're both drunk. That's weird. When's Mr. greer get home? Probably any minute. Why? Are you kidding? He's a total fascist. If he sees joy like this, he'll freak. Come on. Help me get her upstairs. We'll just tell him she's got a headache. Yeah. That won't be a lie. We'll have to come back for her. Michael, I'm gonna be sick. Oh, god, just hang on, o.K. Wait. Hold it a second. Are you crazy? Oh, man. Mr. greer, how goes it? Where's joy? Um... she went upstairs with a headache. She was on the court all day and i guess she overdid it. Well, I'd better look in on her. No! I'll do it. All right, Mike, thank you. Man. [Radio playing] Get the lights. That's good. O.K. I just don't understand what joy was thinking. She knows she needs every second of practice she can get. This could screw up everything. Maybe that's what she wants. What? Never mind. It's not my place. Did she say something to you? Well, the way she talks, it sounds to me like she thinks things are moving a little too fast. I mean, getting married, moving to Connecticut. But we already decided. She thinks... Maybe you're pushing a little too hard. She thinks maybe you guys should try dating other people. What are you talking about? Are you saying she's like been seeing other people like while I've been away or something? Shit! Who is it? I can't believe it. I can't believe she's cheated on me after I've been faithful this whole time. Except for last night. Listen, you just stay away from me. All right? Hi. You didn't have any dinner. Thank you so much, Violet. That's so sweet. What is this stuff? Oh, it's nothing. Spread sheets. No wonder your eyes hurt. Is all this stuff really part of your job? I'm afraid so, Violet. Keeps me out of trouble, though. Maybe a little trouble isn't such a bad thing. Excuse me? It just seems to me like you're avoiding something. Joy told me that you've... Never really gotten over Catherine's death. You know, there's nothing wrong with having feelings, Ivan. I can call you Ivan? If you feel something, go with it. You know? I mean, don't be afraid to follow where it leads. Otherwise... What would be the point of living? Spread sheets. Well... Don't work too hard. Good night. Oh, my god. Oh... my... god. Where are you going? Wait, don't leave yet. Joy'll be right back. Oh... my... god! Oh, my god! Oh. [Sound of car screeching] Do you always swim in the nude? Did you enjoy that? Not as much as you did, i bet. Actually, i uh... Didn't even know you were still here. I'm not leaving until i straighten things out with joy. Have you decided what you're gonna say to her? Not exactly. Maybe this will help. I don't do that anymore. I made a promise to joy. [Sniffs] Aren't you a good boy. I just thought it might help. I'll bet you've promised yourself all sorts of things where joy is concerned. But promises were meant to be broken, Michael. Look, this did not happen. Play to win, Michael. You know, my old mother used to say that house guests and fish start to smell after about 3 days. And what is that supposed to mean? Oh, nothing. You know, i was wondering, the "b", short for "bitch"? I feel like I've been hit by a truck. Drink this. Does my dad know? Actually, he thinks you went to bed early with a headache. I can't believe jaimie, getting me drunk and then splitting like that. I'm so angry at her. She seemed a little upset herself. I'd like to strangle her. I have exactly 21 hours until the tournament, and i can't even see straight. Well, I'll keep the coffee coming. Ivan: Joy! Michael left his jacket in my den, and this fell out of it. Now i can't allow this in my business, and i will not allow it in my family. Do you understand me, joy? It's gotta be a mistake. The only mistake is me allowing you to date him in the first place. Shouldn't we at least give him a chance to explain himself? Now i know you'll do the right thing. He promised me never again. He lied to me. Nothing's more important than the truth, joy. But i guess you can't expect that from a druggie. He's not a druggie. He's just... he's under a lot of pressure, and... What am i gonna do? Listen... Everything's gonna be o.K. Everything's gonna be just fine. I promise. Jaimie doesn't want to see me anymore. And she says she doesn't want to be partners either. I'm not surprised. I knew from the minute i met her, she was only into you for what she could get. You think so? She's nothing but a social climber. [Car pulling up] It's Michael. I'll go down and talk to him. Thanks. Ahem. I want to talk to her about it. You know, Michael, you're really starting to hurt my feelings. What are you talking about? You can't keep pretending like we're not sleeping together. I mean, i thought we had something special going. You told her about last night, didn't you? You bitch. I didn't tell her anything, Michael. I didn't have to. You did this all by yourself. Violet: His pupils were totally dilated. He wasn't making any sense. He thinks the reason you won't talk to him is because of me. It's just like him to blame everyone but himself. Don't help him, joy. Fuck him. All right. I have to stop making excuses for him. I have to be tough. He has to take responsibility. Michael just doesn't give up, does he? They're not from Michael. They're for Gwen, your dad's date for tonight. He finally asked her out? Yes, he did. How do i look, Mrs. b? Oh, Mr. greer, in my humble opinion you are beyond handsome. Thank you, Mrs. b. Oh! Could you get the flowers for me? Hi, honey. Hey, dad. Wow. Very handsome. Thanks. Where are you off to? Meeting my coach to practice one last time before the big tournament. Listen, honey. With everything happening around us, i realize i haven't been that supportive of you, but i want you to know there's no doubt in my mind you're going to win that tournament. Thanks, dad. I just hope i don't let you down. You won't. You're a greer. We deliver. Mrs. b: Well, here you go! Ah, Mrs. b. Thank you. All right. Look! You got some lint right on your shoulder, Mr. greer. Let me get my brush. No, no. Mrs. b, that's gonna have to stay. I've got to pick up Gwen at 7:30. I've gotta get out of here. Come on, joy. Let's go. [Telephone rings] Hello? Woman: Hi, this is Gwen Randall. Is this Ivan's daughter? Yes, it is. Listen, joy. Has your dad left yet? Yes. Shoot. Can you get a message to him? Absolutely. [Car starts] Could you please tell him to meet me outside the courthouse and not at my office? I'll be in front of the kiosk. You've got it. Thanks, joy. No problem. Thanks. Bye-bye. [Telephone rings] Answering machine: Hello, this is the greer residence. Will you please leave a message after the tone. [Beep] Gwen: Ivan, what happened? I stood outside the courthouse for nearly an hour. To say I'm pissed off would be an understatement. In fact, do me a favor and lose my number. [Beep] [Tape rewinds] [Beep-beep] [Exasperated sigh] I love champagne. Violet, you're not legal. I won't tell if you won't. Why are you so dressed up? Party. You're home early. She didn't like them? Actually, she stood me up. I'm sorry. I'll live. You know, in all my life... I don't think I've ever gotten flowers. I just wanted to feel pretty tonight. Maybe dance a little. Laugh... Feel good. I know it must seem silly. Dance with me? I'm not much of a dancer, Violet. It's all right. * it's been nothing but cloudy days * * ever since you went away * * and living without you * * ain't been the same * * come back home * * this is where you belong * * i felt the joy * * and i felt the pain... * we can't do this, Violet. Shh. Violet: I want you to feel good, too. * these dark clouds * * won't allow sunny days * * you say why, dear... * [door opens] Ahem. Shouldn't you be wearing your glasses, Mr. greer? * ...Come back home * * this is where you belong... ** [zip] I cannot do this with you, Violet. Don't make me go. Don't do this to me. I will win. I will win. Please let me win. Joy, you're gonna have to speak to me sooner or later. Michael, i want you to leave me alone. That's not fair. Fair? Michael... god, you are driving me crazy, and I've got the tournament this morning. I know. I want to be there for you. I love you, joy. I don't know, Michael. Joy? All right. We'll talk. After the tournament I'll meet you at the coffee house on campus. O.K. I gotta go. Hey, good luck. Thanks. [Telephone rings] Greer residence. Oh, hello, Gwen! No. His daughter's in a tennis tournament this morning, but I'm sure he'll be in his office later on. Can i take a message? You did? How many messages did you leave? I see. Well, i can guarantee you that he never received any of your messages, but I'm pretty sure who did. Going somewhere? I don't know what you think you're up to, little girl, or why, but I'm gonna put a stop to it right now. I don't think so. You bitch. I got a call from greer's office telling me not to report to my job on Monday because they found another intern. You set me up, you got me high, and you seduced me. If that's what you need to believe so you can live with yourself, it's o.K. With me. You're setting them up just like you set me up. They're my family. I would never do anything to hurt them. They're not your family! Your family's dead. Yeah. That's right. I did a little checking. That junior college never even heard of you. Then i find out that your sister Ivy threw herself out of a window. Shut up. Let's not forget what happened to your mother. I said shut up! I bet you don't even work at Denny's, do you? Now what? I'm gonna tell joy what kind of a person she's really living with. You're gonna tell her you're fucking me? I'm gonna tell her the truth. That'll be an interesting approach for you. Think she'll buy it? I don't think it's gonna be too hard to convince her. Look, I'm going to meet her at 2:00. That'll give you enough time to get out. Well, she won't be there. She never planned to meet you. You're such a liar. Really? Then why did she tell your good buddy Scott to pick her up at the house at 1:30? Hmm? Fuck you. You're gonna be so sorry. Joy! [Buzz buzz] Joy. Joy? Mrs. b? Joy? [Beep-beep] Curiosity killed the cat. Right now, joy's sitting somewhere waiting for you. Guess you let her down again, Michael. You know what kind of people like pain? Let's see... There's doctors, and lawyers... I even have a judge for a client. [Chuckles] But you know, it's not the pain that gets them off. It's the feeling of someone else being in control. I'm in control now, Michael. You know, this whole thing with joy was really just about daddy's bank, wasn't it? I got a really good chuckle out of your pathetic rambling. Kiss-kiss. [Muffled moan] You really should have kept your promise to joy. Michael: Mmmmph... Stayed away from the drugs. This is the shit that killed you. Heh heh. I guarantee... You've never felt anything like this before. Mmmmph! Bye-bye, Michael. Joy? You all right? I played like i never held a racquet before in my life. I just... I couldn't concentrate, you know? It's Michael's fault. He totally distracted you. He didn't even show up. He didn't call again, did he? Come by? I've been here all day. I wanted to teach Michael a lesson, not make him go away. Now i messed up everything. You don't see it. It's not you. It's them. But i want them to love me. Do you think they care? Well, they never will. They'll just use you and throw you away. It's the same for both of us, joy. We're the same in so many ways. Sometimes i just wish the rest of the world would fade away. Where did you get those? Those are my mother's. I just came across them. I didn't think you'd mind if i borrowed them. They were in her jewelry box in the back of her closet. Please put them back. Fine. It's not that big of a deal, joy. Yes, it is, Violet. I think things are getting a little too intense around here. What are you trying to say? I think... Maybe... It would be a good idea if you started thinking about another place to live. Don't worry, baby. I'll fix it. I promise. Oh, my god. He was here. She lied to me. Hi. I... i brought these for joy. I know she's feeling upset about... Losing the tournament. Well, I'm sure she'll love them. I talked to Gwen today. You pretended you were joy, didn't you? You didn't give me her messages. I... Didn't give you the messages because i was jealous. Joy was wrong. About what? It wasn't Catherine i couldn't get over. It was your mother. You look so much like her. I told you i just couldn't do this with you. But you already have... Only I'm not gonna let you turn away from me like you did her. Hello? Dad? [Telephone rings] [Ring] [Ring] Michael? Man: No. This is his father. Mr. Beckett. I was just looking for Michael. I'm afraid i have some bad news for you. What? Michael's been found dead. What? They're not sure yet, but it seems like he might have been murdered. No. Joy? Daddy? Joy: Oh, my god! Ivan: Untie me. Ivan: Joy! Violet: Joy? Joy, please don't leave. Oh, god. Stop it, Violet. Ivan, everything's gonna be all right. I should never have taken advantage of you, Violet. You've got to go, and you've got to go now. Go? You fucked me... And now you're throwing me out? Just like my mother. You promised to take care of her and that she would be provided for. I told you i wouldn't let you turn away from me. I meant it. Just get out. Oh! [Gasps for air] Operator: If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. [Fast busy signal] Help... Me? [Fast busy signal] [Car engine starts] Mrs. b? Mrs. b? Mrs. b? Mrs. b, i need to come in. The breaker box is in your closet. [Fast busy signal] Daddy? Daddy... [Jewelry box plays] Violet? Oh, my god. [Door creaks] [Slam] Where's my father? He's gone. What have you done with him? He did it to himself. What are you talking about? Here. Put this on. I don't think i want to. I want you to. Besides, you can't go like that. Go? Go where? We're going together, but we have to be dressed up. Here... [Tersely] Put it on. All right. You're really freaking me out, Violet. Now, sit. And I'll pour tea. I don't want to sit, Violet. I'm very scared. Don't be scared. I told you I'll take care of everything. And i will. But you have to trust me. Now... Sit down. Where's my father? [Gasps] You killed Michael, didn't you? You're so lucky I'm your sister. Who else would have gone through all the trouble for you? They didn't want us to be together, but now they can't stop us. We'll be together forever. What do you mean? Here. Hold this. Take it! Now... All you have to do is drink. You'll drink first, and then I'll hold you until you fall asleep. I'll have to hold you tight to stop you from thrashing around so much. Then I'll drink, and I'll lay down beside you. And hold your hand. Now... Drink. Oh, you bitch! [Doll music playing] [Music stops] I tried to make it easier for you... But i guess we'll have to do it your way. Joy: Help! Help!
