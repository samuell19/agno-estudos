Protect the freight, come on! Move, move! Protect the wagon! Come on, quick! Come on, come on! Quick! There's no one here, sir. GUN CITY Clear the scaffolds! MZA train held up and robbed! Anarchist suspects rounded up by police! Read all about it in La Voz! War in Africa! Abd El-Krim rebels attack our positions in the Rif! MZA train held up and robbed! Anarchist suspects rounded up by police! Abd El-Krim rebels attack our positions in the Rif! Read La Voz! - He hasn't done anything wrong! - Don't raise your voice. Let him go! - You have nothing to worry about. - Nothing to worry about? I just need to know that he's alright! No, please! Let me see my husband, I just need to know he's alright. Please, please! Commissioner Verdaguer? Who wants him? The Commissioner had to go to see the Military Governor. They're climbing the walls about the MZA train robbery. So who's in charge? Inspector Rediú, first floor, end of the corridor. Thank you. No! No! - Talk! - No! - Talk, damn it! - You coward! Stay there. Leave it me. Talk, damn it! Talk! Come on. Stop whimpering. Confess. What was in the boxes? Where did you hide them? - I don't know anything, I swear. - You don't know? Do you take us for idiots? We know perfectly well you were in on the train robbery. No, no! I didn't do anything. "I didn't do anything..." No, no. He's passed out. Shit. Who the fuck are you? Aníbal Uriarte, Information Brigade, Madrid. Perfect... I ask for twenty men and I get one... That's this country for you. Aníbal Uriarte... I thought you Basques had big paunches and bigger heads. Boss... He's coming to. He's the MZA train driver. We think he had something to do with the robbery, but the bastard won't talk. Let's take him out for some fresh air. Come on. Come on! You come too, Basque. You'll get to see how things work around here. Come on, come on! Move up the sheaves. This is your last chance to confess. Tell us where those boxes are. I don't know... Truly, I don't. Why don't you talk, uh? Why don't you talk? Fucking stand up. Alright, alright... Give us something, a name, an address, something. Something! You're not going to talk then? One of those anarchists with principles. Bastards! Bastards! T.B.! Let the Basque do it. Well, gents, let's have some fun, this looks like a funeral. It's not all work, right, T.B.? I'll go get the shovel. Welcome to Barcelona. What's up, Jordi? You look skinny. - The Baron does not feed me. - Your mother should! Good night, Jordi. Basque, this is the best club in the city, in the whole country! This way, this way. I slept with them last night. Ladies, good evening. Where are you going? Where are you going with him? These ones are new? Inspector Rediú, a pleasure to see you here! You know that even if we're full there's always a table for our friends in the Information Brigade. Thank you, Gastón. What about this one? He's too young for you. María, the guys from the Information Brigade are here! Can you help me? Lola, we're on! Come on! - Where's the glitter? - It's here, there you go. Come on, boys, come on! Les Papillons. These French butterflies come right from the best theaters in Paris! A round of applause for them! And now, the moment you've all been waiting for! With you here tonight, the great Lola Montaner! You're beautiful! I have a little flea in my blouse that hops like crazy all around. So I want to catch him some day, and if I do, he's going to pay. Jumping fast and hiding away, where he bit me I cannot say. Hopping mad, if I find him, I'll give him what I should. I'll repay you, plus interest, I swear. I swear. But I need another three months. Martin, I see only two solutions. Either I exercise the default clause and keep your hardware store... No, please, not that. I inherited it from my father. It's the only property we own. What's the other solution? The other solution... Look who's here! What's going on, Dad? What a pretty girl! What's your name? - Laura. - Laura. How old are you? Thirteen. Do you like to sing and dance? - Yes. - Good, good. Baron, she's just a girl. No, she's a young woman, right, Majorcan? She's a young woman, yes. A young woman. So you might see no more. Take it all out, love! That's it, he's in my hands, and I killed him, that's for sure. The great Lola Montaner! Now we leave you with a musical interlude. Good evening, what can I get you to drink? A kiss for my favorite. That was after Paris. Basque, I don't know what it's like in Madrid, but we can't keep abreast here in Barcelona. Every day we have more work, fewer men, and the same shitty salary. Don't we, T.B.? He spends all his wages on whores. They remind him of his mother. What are you doing? Nicanor, nice to see you so well. Inspector Rediú and company. Welcome to Eden. Everything to your liking? Isn't that the hardware store guy from the Borne? Yes, he's looking for a spot for his daughter and he asked me to lend him a hand. Isn't she too young to work here? I know you prefer ripe fruit, Inspector, but I have clients with other tastes. You mean like yours? You should try it some time. Widen your palate to other delicacies. No, I'm a... a traditionalist. Right. Any rumors about the MZA train robbery? You hear lots of things: that it held the gold reserve of the Bank of Spain, that the thieves were French anarchists... - Actually, nobody knows. - Right. But don't worry, if I hear anything you'll be the first to know. Alright. Enjoy the night. He says he's the bastard son of a German nobleman. But he's a bullshit merchant in on every racket in town. Bastard, son of a bitch. An invert, a monstrosity. You want to slit his guts. Courtesy of the Baron. I take back what I said. Hello, handsome. Come here, princess. Aren't you hot? Yes, what? French from where? From where? - Paris. - Shut up. Or the triple... The Baron likes it. Do you have a light? Didn't you like our girls? First time I've seen you around here. I just got into town. You better watch out then. Barcelona is a dangerous place for cops. I hear business is booming. Ask your boss, I'm sure he can give you all the advice you need. Basque! I'd rather get rich on my own. You'll soon feel right at home. You'll see. War in Africa! Read all about it in El Sol! Here you are. Thank you. War in Africa! Spanish troops besieged by rebels in Annual! Read it in El Sol! "Early estimates talk of dozens of casualties..." If they're saying dozens, that means hundreds are dying. This can't go on. No! We work as much as men, why don't we get the same pay? That's right! We have the same duties, why don't we have the same rights? Why? - We want equality! - Equality! Equal rights and equal wages! Equality! We've had enough of shutting up and taking it! Enough! In Barcelona, we hold the world record for strikes. There were over six hundred last year. Six hundred. Enough of putting up with abuse and discrimination! It's time for action! We want equality! Equality! - Equality! - Equality! - Equality! - Equality... They'll have to listen to us! Equality... Equality? They want equality? They're going to get it. Today they're in for it just like the men, or worse. All together they will listen to us! Equality! Equality! Equality! Come on, surround them! No! No! No! No! Let her go! No, no! No! No! Gentlemen, the MZA train was carrying a consignment of army weapons. Governor Martinez Anido has demanded the immediate arrest of the perpetrators. If we don't get those guns back in 72 hours, he'll bring the troops out onto the streets. We have to act urgently. If the anarchists begin to use those weapons, the city will become a powder keg... Be very careful. Where's the engine driver? Sir, he was hurt... He tried to escape on our way to the hospital... Do you take me for a fool? He tried to escape, so we applied the Escape Law. Who are you? Aníbal Uriarte. I got here from Madrid. That law is an aberration, and I will not allow it in this police station. He was a dangerous anarchist. We're policemen, not common thugs. We have to put an end to violence, not encourage it. Find me those damned guns, but be discreet and effective. Is that clear? Yes, sir. At your command, Commissioner. You have no right! It was a peaceful protest and they treated us like animals! Miss! Miss! The police says you began the confrontation with your violent attitude. It's a lie! Write that! We were protesting for our rights and they sent their horses! There are injured girls! Leave, please. Leave! Leave! No, no! That's enough. Let them go! I'm gonna beat the hell out of that son of a bitch. Let's go. Out, out, out! Out, out, out! Out, damn it! Come on, darling. Forget that, come on. Alright, ladies, hands on the counter. We only take orders from the Baron. You'll do as I say! Come here! Come here! You faggot! The Baron's not going to like this. Tell the Baron that cognac and whores are always appreciated. But we have a deal and he's not sticking to it. Here, kid, count this. Let's go. Basque, where'd you learn to fight like that? Morocco. In the war? We've got a hero among us, a hero. Camera... and action! We have two beautiful nymphs. Two beauties... Lola, whisper in little Laura's ear. Tell her something, what you're going to do. What you're going to do... That's it, good. - Baron. - I'm working. Cut. Put this on. What is it? Rediú. - I don't want to. - I know, honey. Nothing will happen to you with me. Everyone in my office in five minutes. Girls, that's all for today. We'll carry on other day. Laura, give this to your father. Here. You'll see how happy it makes him. Councillor Folch called today. He says he wants to see you again. Baron. I know when he drinks, he goes overboard. But you never complain when he goes overboard with the gifts. I'm pregnant. Again? The office worker? This time it's different. He's asked me to marry him. And to leave Eden. Girl, you're the star of Eden. I know and I'm sorry, Baron. But I'm in love. You're in love? The second-rate chorus girl I turned into a star, in whom I invested my time, my work, my money, my effort, has fallen in love. And probably she's going to say she's leaving me, right? Yes. No. The Majorcan will talk to the doctor. - And that's that. - No. - That's that. - No. Baron, it's my child. That's that! I'm not doing it again. You have a date with Councillor Folch tonight. No. What did I tell you, Basque? The world record in strikes. Go round the back, I don't want any problems. - What did we get? - Nothing. This strike doesn't make any sense. Where are you going? We're tired. We're wasting our time here. We achieved nothing. You know what you'll achieve if you leave now? Trash the effort of all these people. So stop acting like an idiot and go back to your spot. I can't. - Let go of me! - You're not leaving now. I can't take it anymore, I have to feed my kids. We've all got it rough, but no one's giving up here. Let him go. Let him go! If you want to go back... If you want to go back to work, we won't stop you. Or anyone. They'll never give in, Salvador. Never. They will give in! This factory can't function without us. Manuel, if they don't, the factory will go broke and they'll be ruined. Don't you understand? We're so close to achieving this. If we resist, we'll win. I assure you, Manuel. Get out! Get out! I want the names of everyone there. - This is a disgrace. - Yes, sir. Who are they? Don Emilio, they come from the Information Brigade. They want to talk about the robbery of the Madrid express train. You're the ones responsible. If the police acted firmly against the anarchists, the robbery would never have happened. We do what we can. Not enough. Alright, what do you want to know? We think some of your workers were part of the group that did the train job. Here's a list of all of the workers at this factory who are anarchists. Were all of them aware of the train's cargo? Of course not. We were the only ones with that information. And Guillem. Our accountant. - And where's this Guillem? - He hasn't come to work today. Where can we find him? This is his address. Many thanks for your time. Salvador. Don Emilio wants to see you. Do you want to see me? It's a friendly way of solving this dispute. This dispute will be solved when you stop forcing us to work 10 hours a day, stop hiring minors, and finally give us all a pay rise. Don't you people realize? This country is in crisis. Production's gone down, taxes keep rising. A pay rise would put this factory out of business. Don't take us for idiots. This factory made millions during the War. You got rich, just like your father, but we're still just as poor. Don't talk to me like that! Our demands are fair. If you don't go back to work, I'll have to take drastic measures. If you don't listen to our demands, we'll stay on strike indefinitely. Get out. Have you seen Elisa? Any news of Elisa? - Please, have you seen Elisa? - Mother... Wretch, worse than a wretch. - Do you know what you put us through? - Mother, please... Have you seen Elisa? This is all your fault! It should've been you and not that poor creature. What happened? How is Elisa? Go away. Stay away from my daughter. - What happened? - Let's go. How is Elisa? Let's go home. Police! Everybody go home, this gathering is over. Go. Get out of here. It's the accountant. Well, it seems the accountant liked chorus girls. No, no, no, no! No, no! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. This is my fault. I convinced her. I'm sorry. This is not your fault. It was them. They killed my baby girl. You have to keep fighting. Don't give up. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It was a peaceful protest. I know. I know. Let me talk to her mother. I'm so sorry about Elisa. We have guns. And we're going to act. Salvador Ortiz. I need a solution. That's what you'll get. I'll pay you half now and the other half when the job is done. You know I've been a while trying to join the Liceo. The Liceo, yes. I keep running into a wall of incomprehension and provincialism. What you're asking isn't easy. I know. - It doesn't just depend on me. - I know. But if you could lend me a hand, I'd be eternally grateful. And, of course, I'd charge nothing for this service. Baron, the Information Brigade are downstairs. I'll be right back. No, I have to go. But don't worry, I'll talk to my colleagues. Thank you so much. Evening, ladies! Everybody out! Now! Out, damn it! Come on! Out, out! - We want to talk to you. - What's the matter? We think it was... your boyfriend who tipped off the gang who robbed the MZA train. I need names. Are you deaf, you little whore? Don't touch me! Who were his friends? I don't know what you're talking about. Why not ask Guillem? Your boyfriend can't talk anymore. - What? - T.B., Consumptive! T.B.! Miss Lola, just give us the names of his anarchist friends and we'll leave you alone. Guillem isn't an anarchist. What are you doing in here? Just talking to the lady. Let go of her! Let go I said! T.B. You're not telling me how to do my job. You and your men get out or I'll call Governor Martinez Anido. I'm sure the Governor has more important things to do. Shall we find out? Baron, we had a deal: You take care of paybacks and we deal with the bars and businesses. Where is he? The deal expired. Get out. Get out. - You'd better watch out. - You're pathetic. Get out. - Let's get out of here. - Where's Guillem? Where's Guillem? Do you want to find the flea? Take it easy, Lola. Where is he? He'll be fine. It's one of their tricks to scare you, but I'm sure he's fine. Calm down. I'll get you a herb tea. Sit down. You're on in 10 minutes. But really, take it easy, I'm sure he's fine. We're down 150 pesetas from last month. And last month we were down by almost 100. The sooner we get rid of the Baron, the sooner we stop losing money. That bastard has the Military Governor behind him, and the Business Federation, too. We have to get rid of the bastard. No, we can't do anything. We'll get into trouble. Unless we make it look like an anarchist job. We'll take care of the Baron. Everyone's time comes, sooner or later. Right now, we have to find out who robbed the train. Hey, you're not skimming off the top, are you? What are you laughing at? You're not skimming off the top? Writing down all the time... Is it "3 for me, nothing for you"? Are you skimming off the top? Are you skimming off the top? I'll kill you. Answer me, are you skimming...? Just kidding! Shit! Leave the kid alone. Look at him! It was a joke! I'm fine, I'm fine. Let me go, I'm fine. REVOLUTION OR DEATH They used Army issue weapons. You should be proud. The first girl to join an action squad. Get rid of the car. Where were you? I was worried. I'm tired, I'm going to bed. Sara! Keep well away from León. Anarchists don't accept orders or authority, you taught me that. León is dangerous. León is willing to risk his life to change things and so am I. Sara! Guns won't bring on revolution, but chaos. So what do we do? Just stand idly by? Elisa was killed, it could've been me! Don't you care? I am sorry about Elisa too! But killing other people won't bring her back. Dad, strikes and speeches aren't enough anymore. I want to talk to the Baron. The Baron is a very busy man. Tell him I'd like to propose some business. Business? And why would I want to get into business with you? I could be very useful. Oh, is that so? I can supply you with information. And tip you off if Rediú was to make a move against you... Tempting. But I don't make a habit of trusting people I don't know. You don't need to. You'll only pay for a job or for some information. Boys, stop whispering! We're talking. Very well, the Majorcan will get in touch when we require your services. What good are all the speeches? While they kill us, you keep talking and talking. León, this situation will change soon. - It won't change. - Trust me. I don't trust you, ask these people. These people are dying, they're starving. We'll get nowhere with violence. No, ask them! - Violence... - Ask them! Ask these people if they want to keep on dying! This can't go on! Five more comrades gave up today! How long are we going to stand idly by? We're an example of resistance! There are more and more strikes all over the country! More and more workers are joining our cause! What good is that unless we act? The Boss... The Boss tried to bribe me. Do you know what that means? That he's scared! That he's desperate, that the strike is ruining him. That this is the right road. The road where we get trampled by his horses? Where he gradually starves us. If we resort to violence, they'll have the excuse they need to destroy us. This is the road. This is the road! Resistance, this is the road! - Resistance! - Salvador. I don't believe in your roads anymore, and there are lots more like me. The scabs! The scabs are coming! How's that healing up? How's it healing up? You don't give a shit. And I don't give a shit about you either. Listen to me, hero. I know you're up to something... Sooner or later, the chief will work it out too. Well, well, well. A welcoming committee! Any news, T.B.? The anarchist we killed last night worked in the MZA factory. Go with the kid to the anarchist section, see what you can find out. I'll go with the Basque to the factory. Don Emilio, you can't imagine what this means to me. You know I'm a man who keeps his promises. I want you to know everything is settled and your problem will soon be over. Gentlemen. If I may, Governor. - I'd like to... - Severiano, so nice to see you again. General Blanco. Mr. de Fabra. Sir. And Commissioner Verdaguer. Commissioner. Gentlemen, things cannot go on like this. Any day it could be one of us. Don Alfonso is right. We must take measures before it's too late. All my officers are on the case. It's not enough. Gentlemen, my men are entirely at your disposal. Give me names and we will act in a forthright manner. Tit-for-tat reprisals are not only illegal, they are also immoral. So, gentlemen, we'll have to put troops on the street. With all due respect, Governor, the Army is for wars, not patrolling the streets. Just three months ago, they assassinated the President no less. This already is war, Commissioner. No, forgive me. This is a social problem. They stole a consignment of automatic weapons and used them last night. This situation is untenable. Absolutely. Commissioner, our time is running out. What a mess, Basque! There's no way we can get to the anarchists... much less to his leader. Check that out. Those two thugs are Baron's men. I don't know why the fuck they're here, but I don't like this at all. Who's the leader? See that fat guy there with the beard? Salvador, the leader of the anarchists. But he won't be for long. Basque, where are you going? Basque, Basque, what are you going to do? Basque, they'll kill you. Basque! Basque! To victory! Victory! Commissioner. Commissioner. He confessed that the Baron hired him to kill Salvador Ortiz. If they kill Ortiz, the violent anarchists will take control of the situation. Take him to the cells. - Kid, watch him, alright? - Yes, boss. Don't give him a kiss. He's not my type. Commissioner, Commissioner, this is our chance. We have a signed confession. Let's arrest him. It's the word of a hired thug against a "respectable businessman". We can't just let him get away with it forever. I know, but we need concrete evidence. Only then will the bosses and the Governor stop supporting him. Finding those weapons is still our number one priority. We have 48 hours. Ortiz owes me one. I think he might be able to help us. We need to come up with something now, so if you have a plan, get on it. Commissioner, today we stopped Salvador Ortiz from being killed. But unless we do something, the Baron will keep trying and as you say, it'll be war. Alright. Alright. Search Eden for evidence. Bring in the Baron for questioning. Yes, Commissioner. Basque, you take care of Salvador. Miguel Ángel, you and I will visit the Baron, alright? The jig is up for that son of a bitch. Stop! Stop! What's the matter, Lola? - I can't do it. - We already talked about it. The sooner you do it, the sooner you'll get over it. And you, girls, put a bit more pep into it! The public want asses. But live ones, not dead ones! I'm looking at dead asses and I want live ones! If I wanted dead asses, I'd look for chorus girls in the morgue! Come on, from the top! What's the matter? Things didn't go according to plan. Five-minute break. I'll take care of it personally. I promise, no more errors. I'll take care of it. - Baron? - What do you want? You have a call... Hello? It's Aníbal Uriarte. One more step and you're dead. Who was that thug working for? García Serrano ordered it, right? They're going to try again. I could help your father. Why would a policeman help an anarchist? Because he could help me. My dad is no snitch. I know. He's a man of ideals. Are you? I had them once, but they weren't much good to me. I don't trust men with no ideals. Don't trust men with them either. Can I have one? Where's your boss? Are you stupid? Where's your boss? Hold on. Looking for me, gentlemen? Baron, you're under arrest for ordering the death of Salvador Ortiz. I suppose you have some proof to accuse me of such an outrage. The thug you sent is willing to testify against you. I think that call is for you. Yes? Alright. Let him go. You won't be offended if I don't see you out, will you? Let's go. What happened? The thug has been murdered. In the police station. It had to be one of ours. I know. He's with me. The gun. You have to leave it here. He wants to talk to you. What does he want? Leave us alone. How could you bring a cop here? Is tomorrow still on? Of course it's still on. I suppose you want something in return for what you did. If it's money you're after, you came to the wrong place. I want information. What kind of information? Who did the MZA train job? Where are those guns? Even if I knew, I'd never give that information to a cop. We're on different sides of the fence, but neither of us wants this to end in a war. I don't know who did it, but I'm sure they weren't anarchists. Last night some anarchists fired on us with Army-issue guns. Having those guns doesn't mean they stole them. One more thing. Thank you. Be my guest. The Baron wants to see you. You're a real artist. Like it? Come with me. What did I tell you? Wait here. Baron. Here you go. The job was good, and so's the payment. Keep giving me information and I'll keep giving you... envelopes. Everybody hold it! Hold it! On the floor, now! On the floor! On the floor! - Everybody hold it! - Hold it! In the center! Move! This is a robbery. Anyone tries anything, I'll kill him! Cooperate and nothing will happen! You! The money in a bag, quick! Quick! You! Don't move! Don't move! Walk. So you have dealings with the Baron. Yes. The Majorcan killed the accountant, on the Baron's orders. They stole the guns, and they're selling them to the anarchists. - Where are the guns, then? - I don't know yet. You're not playing with us, Basque? The Commissioner wanted the weapons to be found, and that's what I'm doing. Sir, sir... The Bank of Barcelona's being robbed. Not now, kid, not now. One of the robbers asked for Aníbal Uriarte. Sir, we shot down one of the anarchists. Another fled with the money. And we have another trapped. A woman. She wants to speak with Aníbal Uriarte. This is Aníbal Uriarte. Come over slowly. Sara. Is that you? Sara, don't make things worse. Let these people go. Get out. Out, out! Sara, it's okay. It's okay. Just give me the gun. Trust me, it'll be alright. Give me the gun. It's over. Trust me, give me the gun. She's the daughter of Salvador Ortiz. Yes, I remember this hothead. Take off her coat. Give her to me. - No! - Easy, easy. Miss Ortiz. We can do this the easy way... or the hard way. Where's your accomplice? Where did you get the guns? I don't know anything. "I don't know anything"? "I don't know anything"? That's enough! That's enough! You don't give orders to me. T.B.! You can help us and we can help you. Governor, the rumor is that the attack on our positions in Annual is much more serious than the government admits. There's talk of over a thousand dead. You press boys are always making mountains out of molehills. The rebel incursion was serious, but our soldiers will fight back, and get these savages off Spanish territory. The Bank of Barcelona was robbed by the anarchists. There are several dead and others wounded. That's the real problem with this country. We'll put an end to this scum. Governor, Governor, please! What did you find out? She was taken away by the Information Brigade. Find León. Tell him I want to see him. Where are the guns? They were here. Here? Where? Are you jerking us around? They were here, I swear. Take it easy, take it easy. You're so pretty. You're so pretty. You're so pretty. You're stalling us so your friend can get away. That's it, isn't it? You're so hot. No! Where are your accomplices? Where are your accomplices? Where are they? I'm no snitch. Relax, I'm gonna treat you good. Listen to me, are you going to tell me where they are? You smell like strawberry tart. You taste like strawberry tart. Relax, damn it! You're going to like it. - No! - You're going to like it. You're going to like it. Drop the gun. The gun. You're making a mistake, Basque. Let's go. Get in the car. Don't move! Don't move! Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Where's the notebook? It's not worth dying for those motherfuckers. Give me the notebook. Give me the notebook. Get out of here! Get out of here! I told you to stay away from my daughter! It's okay! Salvador! Talking we can understand each other, right? Your daughter wanted to join the group. It was her decision. I want you to stop what you're doing. We're trade unionists, not killers! The goal is the Revolution. For that, we need to take up arms and fight. Don't you understand? In 10 years we've gone from 100,000 members to a million. Soon we'll double that. León. You're either with us or against us. Same here. Salvador, let's go. Salvador, please, let's go! Faster! T.B.! That way! Are you alright? In Madrid, they have no record of any Aníbal Uriarte, or Officer Uriarte, or anyone by that name. So who the hell is he then?! I don't know... All the paperwork we received is fake. Attention! This man calls himself Aníbal Uriarte. He's been passing himself off as a policeman. He murdered Officer Miguel Ángel Barral and ran off with the anarchist girl we arrested in the Bank of Barcelona. I want him alive. Alive. I want to know who he is and what the hell he's doing in this city. Aníbal knows everything about us. If he turns up, he'd better be dead, right? Are you hurt? Just a fragment, nothing serious. My parents used to bring me to this beach. I haven't been here since my mom died. What happened? It was during the "Tragic Week". They were at a meeting, there was an explosion and... Sometimes I dream of the three of us here, swimming... But suddenly I turn around and they're gone... and I'm all alone in the middle of the sea. Why are you helping me? I like people with ideals. We have to go. Lola, you're here at last. Girl, the joint's full. I don't feel well. I'd like to rest. If I told you what I'd like... Come on, go get 'em. The doctor said I should rest for a few days. So, if you don't mind, I'd like to go. But the other time you didn't rest and you were fine. They murdered him. He was a good man. Why? Girl, life is anything but fair. Go on, rest up. I'll find a stand-in. Go. What are you doing here? Give me the Basque. He's passing himself off as a cop, but he is not. Hand him over and I'll leave you be. And what if I don't? Baron, if I'm going down, you're coming with me. Look, Rediú, coming through here are politicians, the military, journalists, criminals, policemen... I know everything about everyone. Don't be naïve. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I thought I'd lost you. No, I'm fine. We have to go. It's only half finished, but nobody will bother you here. I wanted to paint the place, but... I can help you with that. Thank you. No, thank you, comrade. Good luck. Why don't you stay? They're looking for you too. I've got some unfinished business. You can't go with your wound like that. I'm sure there's something here to clean it up. How is it? It's just a scratch. You're bleeding a lot for just a scratch. Let me. What happened to you? That was in Morocco. At the beginning of the war. The cabilas attacked our garrison and the barracks were set on fire. After that it was all blood. And the smell of burning flesh. What are you going to do now? Do you have family or someone? I don't have anyone. You should join us. We could form our own action group. A cop in an anarchist action group? The police are workers too, aren't they? I have to go. Thank you. Take care. Stay out of trouble. You too. I know you killed the accountant so he couldn't talk. I killed the accountant... so Lola wouldn't leave Eden. Who stole those guns, then? Excuse me, excuse me! I have to talk to you. I'm sorry, sir. You can leave now. Leave us alone. Officer Barral tried to kill me. I had to defend myself. He, Rediú and Officer Beltrán extort businessmen and murder anarchists, it's all here. Who the hell are you? That's the least of your worries, sir. I'm about to find out where those guns are, but I need time. Commissioner, you know how corrupt they are. Only I can help you. I need more time. Where the hell is the Majorcan? Gastón, have you seen the Majorcan? No, not since he went out. What are you doing here? Rediú told me you're not even a cop. And you trust him? Rediú doesn't like me doing business with you. Now more than ever you'll need my help. And why is that? The Majorcan is dead. He tried to kill Salvador Ortiz, but it seems his bodyguard is a better shot. I can still help you. Wait here. What's going on? It's all ready for tomorrow. We've got the car... Miss Montaner. The Baron had Guillem killed. What? Basque! Come with us. Stop, stop right there! That boxes, quick! So you're from Orio. I lived for a few months in Fuenterrabía. I was the manager of "Le Casino de Fontarabie", next to the French border. There's nothing like a border to make money, right? Sorry, that's a lie. War is. Silly me. Here he comes. Aníbal, tomorrow's going to be a big day. If you want to prosper, stick with me. As close as possible. Separate the blue boxes from the other. The blue ones on the right. Come on. Captain. All in order, I assume. All as we agreed. Alright. Done deal. I don't think he's coming back. Whoever he is, he has plans of his own. I'm going back to the city. Sara... - The police are looking for you. - We can't stay here, we have to keep fighting. You're just like your mother. Just as brave and just as stubborn. Of course we'll go back to Barcelona, but when things calm down. General Silvestre has committed suicide and General Navarro has been captured. More than 5000 soldiers are dead and another 1000 taken prisoner. An utter disaster. What have you found out? Governor Martinez Anido is responsible for the MZA train robbery. His men stole the arms cache disguised as anarchists so that they'd get the blame. Now they're selling the guns through a local mobster to crank up the violence and... justify military intervention. If we act swiftly, we could still get the situation under control. What happened in Annual could be lethal for the Government. We need to distract public opinion. Minister, if the army and anarchists clash, it could end in a civil war. We'll be ready... When the situation becomes untenable, we'll launch a coup to re-establish law and order. Lots of innocent people will die. It's a matter of national security. That's exactly what I was told a few years ago. There was you, Berenguer and Navarro. Remember? I warned you about that attack, but you preferred to do nothing. You needed a massacre so public opinion saw the Moroccans as savages and that more troops were required. That was a matter of national security too. We did what we thought best for the country. For the country or for yourselves?! Watch your tone, Captain. Your mission is over. Pack your things and go back to Madrid. Disaster in Annual! Thousands of soldiers slaughtered because of an inept Government! Read all about it in Solidaridad Obrera! It's open! - Have you heard? - What? Ortiz has been murdered. - Salvador Ortiz? - You could see that coming. He was shot dead. This is going to get ugly. Bad times are coming. Sara, he'd like it. Come on. Listen a moment! Salvador's daughter wants to say a few words. My father was convinced that dialogue was the road. He believed... that peacefully... we'd win the battle. But he was wrong. And he died trying. The peace he wanted is no longer possible. Salvador's death must not go unpunished! No! The time has come to take up arms and fight!! The time has come for Revolution!! Revolution!! For Salvador! - Comrades, let's fight! - Revolution!! Revolution!! For Salvador! For Salvador! Sara! Sara! Sara! Sara! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. If you take up arms, the Army will hit the streets. They'll kill all of you. It's too late for words. That's what the men who killed him want, they want war! Sara! He chose to take himself out of the picture. We have to arrest García Serrano and the Baron for the murder of Ortiz. It's the only way to calm things down. It wasn't them. Romero. It's the same kind used by the anarchists who attacked the bar. The arms are in Eden. The sale goes down tonight. We have to act now. Happy with the merchandise? Of course. It was you, wasn't it? You killed Ortiz to get control of the Union. Naughty. I hope when this is all over, you'll tell me who you are. Quick, quick! Come on! Aren't you going to count it? I doubt you'd be crazy enough to cheat me. True. But a businessman shouldn't trust even his own father. Scheiße! Police! Baron, stop! You're under arrest! It was you... Sara! Come on. Darling, I did it all for you. On September 13, 1923, General Miguel Primo de Rivera led a military coup with the backing of most military units, the Catalan bourgeoisie and Andalusian landowners. General Martinez Anido was named Minister of the Government.
