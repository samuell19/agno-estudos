(thunder rumbling) - Veronica. - [Reporter] Police, today are still on the lookout for Veronica Roberts, an ex CNA correspondent, wanted in the murder of a coworker. Roberts alleged that the government was regenerating dead soldiers for it's special anti-terrorism strike force. The government continues to deny the existence of any such program.

(helicopter engine roaring) What the hell is going on? - We've got a crisis on our hands. One hell of a problem with the first team. - [Mr. Mazur] Calm down, tell me what happened. - Everyone is offline except GR13 and GR44. And I don't know where the hell they are. But if we don't recover them soon, their systems will overheat and shut down. (birds chirping) (gravel crunching) - [Luc] I'm not sure I understand the objective. - What's to understand? Just do it. (gentle music) You're not supposed to taste, you're supposed to feel. (gentle music) - I guess we're just going to have to keep working at it. - Whoa, slow down or you're gonna overheat.

You know, it's something that makes you laugh. You remember, ha, ha. - Ha, ha. - It's more like a feeling. Laughter his life. - Laughter is life. - Yeah, life, emotions. Here, let's try one. Knock, knock. Why didn't you answer? - I know it's you at the door. - Pretend it isn't me. (wooden table knocking) - Who's there? (door squealing) - Dinner's ready. - Smells great. - Corn beef hash, Luc's favorite. - You'll have to teach me the recipe. - Sorry, can't do that. This dish is the one sure thing that guarantees my Luc's gonna come home every so often and see his mama. - Veronica you're on TV. - A nationwide manhunt is still underway for former CNA correspondent, Veronica Roberts. Roberts is suspected of murdering a colleague, one week ago today, over a drug deal gone bad. - She's innocent. Whoever's behind all this, made up those charges to frame her. - [Man] You let the universal soldier program get out of hand. How did the press get ahold of this? - The woman was unanticipated. - [Man] Your orders are on the way Colonel. You are a soldier, you will obey them. - Yes, sir. - [Man] I want no loose ends. Once you recovered the missing soldiers, silence that reporter, you will terminate all activity. Am I clear, Colonel? - Done. - What about you? If you two are gonna have any kind of future together, you're gonna have to get out of this mess you're in. - We're not sure who's really behind it or how far up it goes. But we're going to find out. - [John] How? - I have a friend at CNA who may still believe I'm innocent. If I can show him Luc, I know we can blow the lid off this thing. - Is my son the only evidence you have? - He's all I need. It's okay. He's safe here for now. (crickets chirping) (machines beeping) - Recovery tracking system initiated. (tracking system beeping) We got him. - Confirm identification. (upbeat music) - Reply confirmed. (car engine revving) - We have reply and confirmation. GR44 is on comeback. - Excellent. How are my new recruits? - They're being regenerated even as we speak, sir. We're a little understaffed here, but we hope to have it back online by the end of next week. - Oh, take your time doctor. Rome wasn't built in a day. (upbeat music) - Who's this with Luc? - That's Luc's brother, Eric. - [Veronica] Where is he? - Eric died a long time ago. He was a soldier too. He went to Vietnam early with a team of advisers. About a year later, we got a letter, he'd been killed while visiting a French army base. It's all we ever heard. Never even got to bury him. - Why? - There was an explosion. They said there wasn't. We were sent his personal effects. It was really hard for Luc, he was only nine at the time. And he was so close to his brother. He just couldn't believe Eric was gone. So on his 18th birthday, he joined the army. We think he went to Vietnam to find his brother. - Anybody seen Luc? He's not in his room. - Did you look outside? - I checked everywhere. - My car's gone. - [Danielle] Maybe he went to the store? - With what? He didn't have any money. - Mr. Devereaux, let me borrow your pickup, I'll go look for him. - She's not running right, the transmission's busted, you won't get five miles in that thing. - John, let her take the other car. - You have another car? - I bought it for Luc when he was in Vietnam, I was gonna give it to him when he came home. Kept her running all these years, hoping he'd come back.

Then you can explain it to the sheriff. - Wait, what happened? - He suckered me into trading his thing for a ticket. Total piece of junk.

I wasn't expecting you, where is? - He didn't make it. - Now this won't do, he said he'd be here. - And he kept his word. This place is like a graveyard. - That is precisely why I needed to speak with him in person. This operation, this facility, we're understaffed. - So you need more bodies? - No more money. - Money, yes. - You see work like this doesn't come cheap. And if we're no longer government funded, where's our financing going to come from? - Patience, Dr. Walker. All of your questions will be answered and your fears put to rest. What's up, doc, are we open for business? - Recovery is complete. - I guess old soldiers never do die, we just turn them into bloodthirsty, killing machines. You know, we could overtake the whole country with just a few of these. Look at him. What's his name? - GR44. - The troublemaker. - Not anymore. - [Mr. Mazur] Are you sure we can control him this time? - I've upped his dosage.

Put your gun down or I'll shoot, I swear. - What do you want? - And need your clothes, your gun and your ID card. - Screw you. (guard screaming) - I told you not to turn around. - Were you able to recover GR13? - He never responded to the RTS. - What about global positioning system? - It doesn't register. Bio readouts are all on the red. - What does that mean? - It means that whatever GR44 did to him, it was permanent. - War is hell. - [Man] Memory clearance complete. - We're ready. - Just a tracking, it's been voice scrambled. He's getting paranoid in his old age. - [CIA Deputy Director Voice] Welcome home GR44, it's good to have your back. And welcome to our new recruits. Gentlemen, because of our recent events, our government's endorsement of the Unisol program has been revoked. - Should we really be telling them this? - He considers them all family. They need to know. (suspenseful music) - [CIA Deputy Director Voice] They say they wont support this family any longer. But this is not the first time your government is turned its back on soldiers like yourself. But I will not stand for it. I will not turn my back on you. I will not dismantle despite what repercussions may come. I plan to keep his unit, this family alive. This government has now joined your list of enemies. And the enemy, as you well know, must be destroyed. - What does this mean? - We're going private. - Mercenaries. That's illegal. - Welcome to the real world. Now let's get this freak show on the road. - [Dr. Walker] I'll assemble a team. (suspenseful music) - Universal Soldier blueprints, should be interesting. GR Unit 2, black box.

We just, we went through a lot together. Except he won't remember me now, they erased his memory. (birds chirping) - You wanted to see me? - We found GR13. - How is he? - He's a jigsaw puzzle. I pulled this off GR44's black box. (GR13 screaming) - Where did this happen? - Don't know yet. But I'll have it broken down for indicators. Shouldn't be too difficult though. (GR13 screaming) - Ooh. (GR13 screaming) - Oh, you gotta respect his style. (intercom beeping) - Go ahead. - Dr. Walker, I'm here in RMT and you're not gonna believe this, sir, but GR5 is missing. - What?

That man, GR5, his real name is Eric Devereaux. He's GR44's older brother. - [Mr. Mazur] How did this happen? (Dr. Walker laughs) - Well let me tell you. It's simple, she walked right in. Our resources aren't adequate. We don't have enough people to safeguard a place this big. (Mr. Mazur laughs) - You better pray this doesn't end up bad.

(car engine revving) - I don't need a babysitter, Mazur, I can handle this transaction myself. - Like you took care of things on the road. - Unforeseen circumstances. It never would have happened if security had done their job back at base. When do these big shots get here? - That's on a need to know basis, Lieutenant. I'm assuming command. - The hell you are. This is a military operation, I have tactical command. - What does that mean? - The Unisols won't respond to you. - They will respond if you tell 'em to. - Look, I don't care who the fuck you are. This is my command, they follow my orders. You wanna show off, I do the showing, is that clear? (Jack Cameron screaming) - Who's in charge? Who's in charge?

(RV engine revving) You can keep your hundred bucks. - Hey, hell of a driving job, pal. - [Veronica] We need to find another car. - We've got to cool off first. (suspenseful music) - She's swell. - Yeah, swell. - I need a cigarette. - Well I hope she doesn't come back too soon. - Give me your. Hey, how'd you do that? - They're twist off caps. According to the Surgeon General, consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a motor vehicle. - No shit. - No driving the truck tonight. (Eric laughs) - Well you haven't lost your sense of humor, anyway. (gentle music) Cheers. - Cheers. I think the Surgeon General might be onto something. - There's no way this little girl's gonna get away from us. We're gonna come find you, honey. (car engine revving) - Okay guys, let's go.

(garbage truck closing) (gentle music) (Mazur screaming) (gun firing) (gentle music) - Luc, wait, he's dead. - I'm going to fix him. - You can't. Luc, please listen to me. - Knock, knock. You're supposed to say who's there. Laughter is life. You told me that. Why doesn't he respond? - Eric never took to the treatments. That's why they never put him in the field. He's not built the way you are. He can't be brought back. (gentle music) I'm sorry. (gentle music) (birds chirping) Take your time. - I'm gonna find out who did this to us. I swear they're not gonna get away with it. - [Dr. Walker] To create life costs money and we're running out of it. - [CIA Deputy Director] Do we have enough resources to regenerate the team? - [Dr. Walker] Yes, but he's still out there and we cannot sustain another blow like this. - [CIA Deputy Director] Don't worry. You'll get your money. And what about the picture? - The research is complete and I have assembled a team, sir, but I don't think. - Don't think, Dr. Walker, that's my job. Yours is to do. Just do what I say and stay on track. I will not have this agenda derailed. - [Dr. Walker] Yes, sir. (gentle music) - [Man] Thanks, pal. - How much you want? - 10 bucks. (gentle music)
