In the ruins of an ancient monastery, the book was first discovered. Was it a gift from God or the devil himself? No one knew for certain. Its pages spoke of the blood ritual that could free the pure of soul from the bonds of the material world, the deed from death itself. The corrupt monks twisted the book's purpose and began using its passages for unspeakable rites. A lone brother opposed them. He attempted to destroy the book's power. But by then, it was too late. The evil consumed him. The entire monastery perished in a terrible fire. Miraculously, the book survived, its dark purpose now fulfilled. Its passages created a gateway allowing lost souls to travel freely between the dimensions of the living and that of the dead. So the text says. Try some wine, Jill. Thank you. So that's the book, huh? How did you get it? It's a family heirloom. So, Professor Kapps, now that I've seen your collection, I have got to know. Is there any truth to all this? Oh, Jill, you took my course. What do you think? Will my answers affected my grade? Nice staff, professor. It's a key, actually. Really? It's not any normal key, Jill. Oh. passages of the book were meant to open a portal. The purpose of the staff was to close one. Hm. It is getting late, and I do need to get ready for that Halloween parade tonight. Maybe I could, um, change into my Halloween costume here. Of course. I'll be waiting. Professor? Professor? Professor? Professor? Why? Because, Jill, it's all true. The book really does open a portal but only so long as it is purified in the waters of time and the fire from the unholy sacrifice of human beings. And you were in the wrong place at the right time. Oh, no, no, no. Kill the effects. Jesus. That was pathetic, pledges. Screaming like that wouldn't wake my baby sister. I mean, what are you, mute, son? Aren't afraid of the dark, are we? No, of course not. Sleeping with the light on? Still wet your bed at night? You better not. I'm the bunk beneath him. You know, I don't think any one of you has ever truly been frightened in your entire lives. Well, tonight, that is gonna change. You are going to discover horrors until now unknown to mankind. Please. One second. Do you have a problem with tradition, Justine? No, I just thought that this whole joint hazing thing was gonna be about teamwork and not about one of your juvenile pranks. Oh, juvenile, huh? You just wait and see. Any questions? What do we have to do? The pledges want to know the first part of their impossible task for tonight. Joining a sorority and a fraternity is like adopting a family of brothers and sisters. You will no longer be an individual. You will be a family. Now what you have in front of you is a list of items with point values. A total of at least 50 points must be obtained within the next four hours. You are to act as a group and combine your efforts. If the points are low, and I mean even by one, then nobody gets accepted. Oh great. Tell me about it. However, it takes balls and tits to be one of us. Big ones. You stand very good chance, do you? Aw, thanks. Get on with it, Jacob. Well, after the scavenger hunt is complete, you will then proceed to the address at the bottom of the page with the items to be tallied in the morning. Uh, question. Sorry, what do we do until morning? Anything you want. You just can't leave the house. The five of you must spend the entire night in the one, the only, the infamous Hack House. Over 60 years ago, Jeremiah Hackford came home early one day. I'm tickled pink that things are.. And I'm your fellow tonight. Do do do do. We'll be that red letter day. Nobody survived. Even old Hackford himself was found hanging by a noose in his own living room. You know, it's rumored that Hackford's spirit still haunts the halls of that house. Anyone who ventures in is never seen again. The task is set, pledges. Good luck. And remember, you're a team. Act like one. Your uniforms are in the back. Dismissed! OK, we're divided in two groups, two cars. Chop the list in half. Wait, I thought we were supposed to do this together-- you know, as one unit. We're doing this to win. And I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen. Two groups, end of story, got it? What are you doing? Oh, I-- I don't wear bras either. I'm on Delia's team. Me too. What a way to spend Halloween. Let's go! You're wasting time! Let's go! Looking right, up, and down for my little blue dogs. Nowhere where my baby said. Got my little blue dogs. my baby my little blue dogs. In the air, flying everywhere, my little dogs. Everything's got to be somewhere. Oh where, oh where can they be? You know, we can get in some serious trouble for stealing some of these items. Not if we don't get caught. They'll recognize us! Oh, never mind. Ready to raise some hell? If I must. Here we go. Woo! Let the party begin! your hand in guts tonight. Throw your clothes onto the floor. Rip your arms and pat your head. Do the zombie dance. Bend your fingers 'till you hear a snap. Out your veins and up your back. Spin your head. Do the zombie dance. Dance, dance, dance. Do the zombie dance. The zombie dance. Stick a red hot poker up your tush. Smoke from your ears like a burning bush. Run down the street with your head on fire and do the zombie dance. Hey! Dance, dance, dance. Do the-- Hello! Get the sign, man! Do the zombie dance! Sorry, dude. Happy Halloween. Woo woo! Why don't you play me like you play that bass? Play that thing. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. Cook a cannibal kidney stew. Ask your friends, what's eating you? Throw it up and eat it again. Do the zombie dance. Dance, dance,dance. Do the zombie dance. Do the zombie dance. Go, go. Move it, move it! Come on, come on! Go, go! Asshole! Put that somewhere, would you, Teddy boy? Where? There's no room. OK, then you hop in the trunk. OK, but it's pitch black in there. Oh, it's easy. You just curl up in a little ball, and then we'll let you out when we get to the house. No way, all right? No-- no trunk, all right? No fucking trunk. OK, dude. Calm down. We're just kidding. No dark trunks for Tim! All right, keep going straight a couple blocks. Why? We've got an hour left. If the others did half as well as us, we should be way over the limit. I'm not worried about them doing anything. We're going to reach 50 points ourselves. How? The only item that can get us there is that Savior of the Souls book. It's worth 20, but who even knows what it is? I do. There's only one place to find it. Professor Kapps' place. Right, isn't he that weirdo teacher of mists, magic, and morons? Science and pseudoscience. I took his course. Right. Savior of the Souls is his book, his most prized possession. Supposedly, he keeps it hidden somewhere in that house. All right, what's so special about the book? Rumors say it's a spell book. Conjure up the dead. You know, turn men into monsters, give girls orgasm, you name it. "Evil Dead" territory. It can give orgasms? Doesn't sound evil to me. Check it out. We may be in luck. Looks like nobody's home. Cool. You know, Marsha, if you're having problems in that whole orgasm department-- Ugh, keep dreaming. Let's do this. Bitch. Just find one that's open. Yeah! Fucking kidding me. What? I had a boyfriend that used to do this for a living. The things that that guy could do with his fingers. Fine. You know, I mean, nobody knows what this book looks like, can't we just take any book and say-- No, Kapps described the book in great detail. A gold clasp down the side with a gaggle of snakes with some kind of transference on the front and bound in animal fur. Lovely. - Hey, Marshall. - Huh? Hey, if we don't find the book, maybe this could help you. Ha, yeah. Go look upstairs. Oh god. OK, let's try that again. What are you doing in here? Doug. I found it! You will both die for this intrusion. Holy shit, catch! It's just a scavenger hunt, professor. Whoa! Oh fuck. What the fuck? Oh my God. Oh my God, we just killed him. What are you-- what are you doing? Calling the cops. Fuck do you think? Are you fucking-- are you insane? We just broke into a house and killed a man. I don't know about you, but I don't feel like spending the rest of my life in prison. We just killed Charlie Manson the Second, asshole. There's a fucking bunch of dead bodies downstairs. 911. Hello? Hello? Are you there. Just shut up. Shut up. Wait! What are you doing? Police will trace the call. I don't think either of us need this on our transcript, OK? But what about-- This fucking psychopath accidentally fell down his stairs, impaled himself on one of his freaky statues. He died. That room tells the rest of the story. You're right. They don't need us to figure out what's been going on. You're right. Let's get the fuck out of here. Ah! Fingerprints all over the place. 911. Hello? We're going to run a trace on this call. No. OK, deep breaths. Stay calm. Just breathe. Yeah! Feeling better? No. It is kind of big and scary. Yeah, don't you worry, little lady. Anything in there tries to harm you, he'll have to answer to me. Good. I've always wanted a guard dog. I don't know. Could be worse. And it's worse. What was that? Hackford using somebody's head as a basketball is my guess. What do you think, Einstein? Loose shutter blowing in the wind against the side of the house upstairs? Now that is just plain silly. You're just trying to scare me. Are we having any luck? Maybe. My God. What do you think? You want to check that out? Not a chance. You? I can live with it if you can. Are they coming? No. They're a bunch of pussies. This is so lame. Why don't you just relax, ice queen, huh? Don't worry. They'll really be screaming before the night's over. Emergency response. 401. Emergency response team, please-- What's the deal, doc? Punctured right ventricle, a massive hemorrhage, and a coma he probably won't come out of. This your work, Lieutenant? I wish it was. The sick bastard deserves to die. Fine. If I fail, you can congratulate me. Did you see that girl on the table? I think I knew her. Jesus, I mean, I can't believe it. I-- I had Norman Bates as a teacher. You kept the book? Yeah, like the staff. Your fingerprints, remember? Well, get rid of this shit. Toss it in the street! Right, so the police can find it and figure out somebody else was there? I don't think so. Look, I'm the guy. I'm the leader. You're the girl. You can do exactly as I say. You got it? Ah! Dick! Fuck! Look, we go back to the original plan. We spend the night here at Hack House. They don't need to know. And the book? We'll keep it hidden. We'll burn it when nobody's looking. All right, fine. But I hold onto the book. Why? Because I don't trust you. You may want to try and keep it as some sick memento. Give me that. You know nothing about me. Shit. This is a goddamn nightmare. This is insane. OK, that's 22 points so far. 25, 28, 31, perfect. Hey, don't forget my boyfriend. Hi, Pumpkin. All right, the rat is four. The orange and black rope, that's 40. That gave us three. Guitars, two. One for the lawn jockey and tombstone is seven. Fif-- 56 points! We-- we made it! Sweet. Now we just kick it for the next seven hours, and we are all official members of Sigma Psi and Delta Pi. Ah, whatever shall we do to pass the time? Sex! We-- I'm-- I'm sorry. Did I say that out loud? My bad. But guys, do you think there's any truth to that story? Do you think there are ghosts here? Delia? Dead and buried is a condition that doesn't change. Kind of like the space in between your ears. No reporters.. No change. He's holding steady. BP is 105 over 40. He's very unstable. We're having trouble keeping his pressure up. Keep him on the cardiac monitor. Vitals every 15. Yes, doctor. I don't want any access to this room without my authorization. - Yes, sir. Well, there's nothing much more we can do now. Just wait and see if he's still with us in the morning. So you don't believe in ghosts. No, I don't. Well, what about Casper? What about the boogie man? You're kidding, right? So what scares you? Stupidity. Come on now. It's Halloween. We're in a haunted house. I want to hear some scary stories! You guys aren't afraid, right? Oh, of course not. Ah! What? God, it's burning! It's burning! Jesus, fucking thing's on fire! Now where's my book? Holy shit. Is this what I think it is? "Savior of the Souls." It actually does exist. Yeah. Way to go, hot shot. Professor Kapps is gonna be so pissed to find this missing. How'd y'all get this? It wants to burn? Well, it's gonna burn. Ah! ah! What do you think caused that? I don't know. Fire down below. Wow. Ah. Where'd it go? Look, it's a book. It's a fucking book. Yeah, what's up, dude? It's freaking out. We've got to destroy it. Down through here. What's down there? The book. This isn't a fucking game, man! I know! I know! It's a fucking book, man. No, no, no! Fuck, calm down, tiger. Josh, we're supposed to be afraid of this house, not of each other. - You don't understand. The book is evil. - And it will be punished. We'll all take turns spanking it later, OK? Look! It fell into the basement, OK? We'll get it back. All right, fine. I'll get it myself. Take your time down there, Doug. Well, I could really use a drink right about now. That's what we forgot! The beer. I didn't. I got a cooler in the car. Works for me. Be right back. I thought we weren't supposed to leave this house in the morning. - Come quick. They'll never know. Oh! What the f-- What the hell did you press? I didn't press anything. I thought you did something. Huh. Subtle. We're locked in? Yeah, it would appear so. Son of a bitch! Real funny, guys. Huh. What, you think Doug's doing this? Sorry, Julia thinks we're playing. Come on. You guys really don't think they'd tell us all those stupid stories, get us here, and not try and scare us? Of course. Sigma Psi rigged the house. So it's all a prank? There's no real danger? Well, I wouldn't say that. Don't you just love it when they run? Come here, you little wabbit! Oh great, they buried all the bodies in the cellar. You're all dead when I get up there if you don't unlock that goddamn door right now! Ah! Oh, don't! Uh-uh! Mr. Bones makes an appearance. That's 10 points. It's not that scary. You know, you're absolutely right. Mmm, nothing compares to the sight of you naked in the morning. Mmm, oh. Oh! Oh, that's a good idea. He's gonna pay for this one. That's what I had in mind. Ah! Oh. So now that you got me, what are you going to do with me? How about another scavenger hunt? The kind dogs play. Dogs have scavenger hunts? It's very easy. You find the bone, and I'll bury it. Oh, I think I already found it. That's impossible. You're dead. Not quite, Mr. Leary. But you never were a very good student. My course has always been considered a bit of a joke, hasn't it? None of you ever had an inkling of what I was really teaching-- the process of observing nature, the purity of mind and body that I have devoted my entire life to, that my ancestors have devoted centuries to preserving. You had no idea what I'm talking about, do you? You wanted it. Go ahead. Pick it up. Now read the passage that opens the gateway. Why? If you read the passage, then I can leave. There. I think that's it. Uh, suspiriorum dom-- dominoes? Um, port-- port-- portalis-- portals. There's an English translation on the other side of the page. You-- you do know how to read English, don't you? And released shall be the spirit world from between life and death. I command the soul trapped in the land neither of the living nor the dead be freed to find the next world. What is he doing? I don't know. It sounds like he's praying. I love this. I love it. When these words are spoken, the door shall open. Thank you. By the way, I forgot to mention. An open door works in both directions. You can go out, and you can also come in. Sounds like Doug. Oh yeah, he's stupid enough to fall for their pranks. Better than falling for Roy. To each their own. Personally, I like my guys to at least a little brainwave activity. Tell me what 2 plus 2 equals. 4. I-- I mean, it's usually 4. Just tell me one thing. Will you still respect me in the morning? We'll see. You are really something. Huh? Doesn't anything frighten you? It's going to take a hell of a lot more than this to get me screaming again this evening. Yeah, me too. I've noticed. What? Oh, you mean back at the frat house. Yeah, well, I can explain that. Well, it just started when I was six. My parents were out for the night, and, um, I had this babysitter over. Well, she was this college girl, and she, um, invited her boyfriend over to study, if you know what I mean. Oh, study. Got it. Anyway, I wanted to play games, so she suggested hide and seek. So you know, I ran upstairs, hid in my parents' closet. It was pitch black in there. I mean, there was this small shaft of light from under the door frame. But I mean, I could-- couldn't really see anything. And then I began hearing these, uh, noises. I was sure there was something in there with me. I wanted to scream and run out of there, but I couldn't move, couldn't even make a sound. I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. So what happened? You see, they never even came looking for me. They were too busy studying. I was in that closet in the dark all night until my parents came home. And ever since then, I just can't stand to be alone when it's dark. Doug-- now we are one. All right, it sounds like he's going to the kitchen. I got Doug. Get the two in the bedroom. You really get off on this haunted house shit, don't you? Well, it beats the family-oriented scavenger hunt, huh? Come on, Justine. Everybody likes to be frightened. Why don't you give it a try? Oh, you know, unless you're too afraid of breaking that cold shell of yours. No, Jacob, I am perfectly comfortable with that cold shell of mine. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. Jacob Sterling, another underachiever. But first, we play. Oh yes. That's it, baby. Mmm, be my lapdog. Just breathe through your ears. It's-- oh God. God! Yes! That's it. Good boy. Oh. Oh baby, don't stop. Oh. Whoa. Oh wow. Marry me? Oh! Oh yes! Ah! Good bye. Isn't she overdoing it a bit? You tell me. I thought you guys loved that shit. Get it off! No! What the hell is this shit? What was that? Hey, Justine. Justine. OK. Fuck! Ha ha! Huh, nothing like a good scare. Right, Justine? Huh? Hey, look. Hm? Get a load of the party hats on her, huh? I know somebody who could use a pair of these. She's a babe and a dummy. It's a perfect combination. Now that's nice. That's very nice. What, no darts? Ah! Damn it! The Hell's going on here? Justine! Justine! That's cute, guys. That's real cute, but I don't like balloons. You and me together will be forever in love. Real funny, guys. Oh yes, we will. You think I love you now. Kind of catchy, huh? Imagine-- Don't even suggest dancing. Don't worry. I wasn't going to. That's too bad. You know, it wouldn't kill you to loosen up a bit. What do you mean? I'm loose. Right. If that were true, you would've been able to let out your scream like the rest of us. Just-- just got stuck. Yeah, it got stuck right here. It wasn't strong enough. Didn't come from down here. That's where your fire is, your-- your passion. Except yours is all locked up. Just learn to release it. You'll overcome all your fears. And that's done by? Making the first move. You and me together. Oh, I'm sorry. I hope I'm not disturbing anything. Ha, you found it. Congratulations. So what's the big deal with that book anyway? It's special, really special. It can give women orgasms. You'd be surprised. Wanna have a go? Careful. Careful watch your step. - Keep your head up. - Justine! Up! What on Earth are you doing here? Oh boy, what's-- oh. - He can't talk. He just bit off his tongue. - He what? I bit-- Keep it up! Keep it up, and we'll stop the bleeding? Well, he was always speaking out of turn. You fucker. Is this another fucking game? Wait, I had nothing to do with this, OK? Jacob and I were just playing around. Playing around? What kind of game involves biting someone's tongue off? - -supposed to get hurt. - This is just part of initiation. We were joking around. - Will everybody just shut up? We've got to stop fucking around and figure a way out of here. Now I just had I don't know what crawling around inside of me, and I am not sticking around for any more. Delia? Yes, Tim. What is it? I thought that you were-- A bimbo? An airhead? Yeah, I know. It was an act. An act. Yes. Most guys like it-- the innocent bubbly type? You know, cute girly boys? Giggle. All that bullshit. Sorry, Roy. I just-- I wanted to get you into bed, and it's the easiest way. Is there still-- Up, up! Keep your head up. Please understand, Roy. It wasn't like I was using. I just-- I thought you were kind of cute, and you know how it goes. Well, I'll be damned. Probably. All right, then unlock the doors, and we'll get out of here together and take Roy to the hospital. But-- but we didn't lock the doors. Well, then who did? I don't know, OK? I-- I think Jacob has the keys. I'll go find him. Wait, will somebody come with me? Please? I'll move. I mean, I'll go. Shh, don't try to talk, Roy. Keep your head up. That's it. OK, now what exactly was crawling around-- I don't want to discuss it. Why did he bite off his tongue? I said I don't want to discuss it. You know, I have a feeling and none of us are going to survive the night. Shut up. Not after what we did. No, don't even start with that guilt trip shit, OK? He was a fucking freak and a weirdo, and he deserved exactly what he got. Did I miss something? Do you believe in judging another man's fate? Yeah, this particular situation, I do. Then you must also believe that what goes around comes around. You know, around? What the fuck are you doing? Stop it. - And around. - Let go of me! And around. Let go, asshole! And around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around. Oh yeah! Woo! Welcome to our parlor, said the spider to the fly. Care for a second helping? Come on! Stay away from her! Eh? Eh? I'm sorry, I didn't get that. Pussy got your tongue? Ah, you're gonna fucking die! Thank you, and good night. Hm? Please keep all heads and legs in the vehicle when the ride is in motion. Get up, Doug! Oh. Oh, dear. Should have obeyed the sign. Oh fuck! OK, what was all that about back there? Saw the same thing I did. No, no, no. Before that-- your conversation with Doug. Who was the sicko who deserved what he got? Professor Kapps. We accidentally killed him earlier this evening. Oh. Huh. Well, it looks like you didn't do a very good job. This can't be happening. Kapps is dead. Doug's just-- he's gone crazy. He's lost his mind. Yeah, and his face wasn't in terrific shape either. We need a weapon. Go. I don't have a fucking weapon. Yeah. Right. So where's Jacob? He's supposed to be here, damn it. What-- what is this? What are you guys into? I don't know how these things got in here. OK. - What? - It moved! That thing-- it moved! Ah! I thought we were the ones who were supposed to be scared. Right, there's nothing in here. We're going back to find Marsha. But-- OK. OK, it's solid. I'm just-- must be losing my mind. Don't stop. I know what you like and what you need. No, no, this is not happening! You are just a cold hunk of plastic shaped like a woman! Are you sure it's not the other way around? No, I know who I am. That's right. You're a cold bitch inside and out. No demons. This is seriously fucked up. More bars. God, this is completely disgusting. You know, you really shocked me earlier. I could have sworn you were a bimbo. Huh. I could have sworn you were a bitch. I am a bitch. I guess that proves I'm not a bimbo. Ah! fuck! Cannot believe those assholes are still playing games. I thought Justine was on our side now. Oh God. Happy fucking Halloween. Marsha! Delia? Where are you guys? Tim, we're up here. Marsha? What-- what are you guys, uh, doing up here? It's really dark, you know. Ugh, this is so childish. Nice trick. Come on in. We have to talk. Don't do that! You almost scared me-- To death? No, I'm-- I'm getting better. Really? Well, Marsha been giving you some pointers? We were just talking. But you are interested in more, right? I know a surefire way to get into her pants-- one good, swift blow to the back of the head. Bam! She's out cold. You can do anything you want. Trust me on this one. Yeah, uh, not really my style. Style! What style, Tim? You have no style. Face it-- you're just a weak, pathetic, useless waste of space who's scared of his own shadow. Am not! OK. All right. Well, then does this scare you? Ah! Oh yeah, Jacob, Tim. Tim, Jacob. You guys already know each other. Ah! OK, here's your chance. The girls are right next door. Show me what you got. Let it out! Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim. It's very disappointing! You know, it just almost takes the fun out of killing you. You know what I mean? Almost but not quiet. You two are becoming a real pain in the neck. Say ah, asshole! Oh God! Oh boy. Uh, I don't know about you guys, but I'm ready to go home. I didn't plan on spending the evening killing my friends. Excuse me. Could somebody please explain what the hell is going on? Doug and I went to Professor Kapps' place to steal the book. He was home. He was insane. We killed him. And now somehow, the spirit has been able to possess Doug. OK, OK, wait. If-- if Doug was possessed, couldn't Professor Kapps' spirit just leave his body and enter someone else? I didn't think of that. You should have. Hey, hey! Stay away from me. It's just me, Marsha. How do I know that? What? Oh, come on. He's not inside of me. He was before. Ah! - Give me-- - Asshole! Give it to me! Don't try me! I will use it. I swear. OK, Tim, calm down. Le-- le-- let's try to discuss this situation intelligently. That's a good idea. How do you know? You may be with the fricking demon. Tim, could you do something about that? Oh. Ah! OK, guys. Uh! This isn't getting us anywhere. We have to get out of this house. Go right ahead. You want me to leave by myself? Oh, no, no, no. That won't work. She may just hide somewhere and kill us when we're not looking. Why do you think it's me? It's probably her. - Ah! Now I know it's you. Tim, she's the tricky bitch-- pretends to be a ditz one minute, then normal the next? That's just fucking weird. All right, look. It can be in any one of us but not more than one, right? Yeah. All right, so we just better stick together so that if one of us suddenly demonizes, the other can just come to the rescue. OK, I'll go along with that. Me too, but lose the axe because it's not fair that any of us have it. Wait. What if the demon's tricking us all and nobody's possessed? We go out there unarmed, and he can easily knock us all off. She has a point. Stop! We're going about this all wrong. Can't you remember what Justine said back at the frat house? She said when you join a house, it's like becoming part of a family, a-- a team. You know, sticking together? We haven't done that once this entire night. We've gone our separate ways since we've gotten here. Now four of our friends are dead. We can't trust each other? Yeah, well, tonight is like worst case scenario. Yeah, and it's at times like this that our bonding should be at its strongest. She has a point. Thanks. So what do you suggest? I think we should take a moment, pull yourselves together, join in for a nice long group hug. A hug? Slice the bitch. She's a fucking demon. You guys are so lame. Come kill me. Now it's time to die! Die! Die! Ah! Oh God, here we go again. My turn! just want me to protect you? Leave! Uh! Ah! Fuck! Shit, shit. Delia! Delia? Delia! Come on! Fuck! Come on! Open up! Come on! Forget it. The place is sealed tighter than this-- this damn corset. We're going to have to fight our way till morning. Why? What happened that morning? Witching hour ends. Halloween's over. Spirits have to fly away at dawn, don't they? I have no idea! I don't even know what we're up against! My-- my only guess is that it's somehow connected to the book Doug had. The book! Of course. There's got to be a-- a pa-- a passage to exercise a spirit or something. OK, last time I saw it, Doug had the book when he was in here. Right, and then he dropped it when he attacked Marsha. It should still be here. Right, it's worth a shot. Knife? Spear? Poker? You know, Delia, I prefer the real you to that bimbo character any day. Thanks, Tim. Spear? Poker. Now let's kick some demon ass. Looking for this? Planning to read a passage and send me hurling into the great beyond? Or better yet, burn the book and hope my soul burns with it? I don't know. We hadn't gotten that far. Let us enlighten you. For over 30 years, I've kept this book in perfect condition waiting for a night like this. You see, to remain pure, I could not take my own life. And once in spirit form, I needed someone to read the passages, free my soul. Why be trapped in the land of the dead when I can be free to rule in the land of the living? Just the thought if it gives me goose bumps. Or perhaps it's just chilly. I can fix that. No! Oh yes. It's happening. In a few moments, there'll be nothing left holding me to your physical plane. He's gone into cardiac arrest. Set the defib. Pupils are fixed and dilated. Charge the paddles. Now the only question that remains is what to do to you two. How about a little violence? We've always wanted to skin a bunny. Ah! Charge. Clear. Ah! Leave her alone! Don't worry, Tim. She'll be alone when you're dead. Do it. What is that? No! Nothing. No change. Bump me to 300. Charged. Clear. No! Let the flesh die! Beginning CPR. Ah! It must be a trick, right? No, no, it's not! Save me! Yeah, we've heard that one before. The hospital. His body's in the hospital. It didn't die. It has to die before it can complete its escape. Charged. Clear. You have to get to the hospital. We can't let his body die. How do you know that? I was trapped in there too, you know. I know the good. She's right! It's gone! Open house. Let's go! Son of a-- Help. Help me. Lieutenant! Here to assist? Scalpel? Thank you. It's too late. He's coming back. Hey, come on! He's back for me. God damn it! Damn, Marsha! I can't open it! Run, Delia! Go get help! He's free. There's nothing holding him back, and as long as the gateway is open, his soul's invincible. Where is it? Where-- where's the gateway? It was opened when Doug read the passages. Doug was himself until he went to the cellar. Only the staff can close it now. Staff? What staff? It's still in the car. Delia, the staff! It's in the car! Marsha? M-- Ma-- Marsha? Ma-- Ma-- Marsha? Where is he? Where'd he go? You tell me. He's not inside me, Tim! He tried, but he wasn't strong enough. He's still around here, though, somewhere. Wh-- what does he want now? To tear us apart, to rip our guts out. All right. Then we just better stick together. You know, I kind of wish right now that we had a chance to finish what we started by the fireplace before all this went to hell. Me too. Maybe that's it. Ma-- Maybe that's the-- the secret, the way to beat him. What-- what do you mean? Most powerful force in the world. Love. What do we have to lose? Stop me if you have any objections. You're naked. Then take me. You're taken. Uh. Love? Give me a break. Seduce one of your own kind, asshole. Hey, Tim. Lights out. OK, Timmy. Go and hide, and we'll count to 10. There it is. All you have to do is force us inside and close it back up. We're ready when you are! Marsha, fight him. Fight him from the inside. Force him out. Please! You can do it. You really think something that simple could work? Oh God, yes. God. - That's-- that's it! Get him out! Force him out! Get him out! Dear me. Too much Halloween candy. Let's see what happens when a human skull crosses through the gateway. See for yourself, bitch! My staff! Mine now! The staff! It's the only way to stop them. Sure you can handle it, little girl? No problem. Problem. Ah! Careful. You might break a nail. Hell will have a ball balling you. Oh yes! No! Well, well. The loser found his voice. And I found your path to hell. No! Come on, come on, come on! I'm back. Not for long, you son of a pig-fucking asshole-licking puss-dripping dog-screwing, shit-eating bashing prick-teasing bastard bitch dummy! So a little pent up anger there, Tim? It's kind of been building up for the last 14 years. Well, thanks for saving my ass. Just returning the favor. Oh damn. I wish Marcia just-- Marsha? Hi, guys. Hell wouldn't have me. Guess I haven't been that big of a bitch after all. Ow, ow, ah! A little beat, you know? I'm sorry, honey. Sorry. Ow! I said I was sorry! For staring at my tits earlier. Oh, right. Uh, they're very nice, if that matters. Why don't we get out of here? That's a great idea. Look, it's dawn. We made it. You know, I don't think I want to join this sorority anymore. What do you say next Halloween, we all just stay home? So Tim, did you ever dream this night would end with you walking into the sunrise with two new girlfriends? Ha! One new girlfriend. Ho! I never dreamed this night would end, period. You did pretty good for a computer geek. If you say so. OK, listen up. I don't particularly like computers. Libraries have always given me the creeps. I never got into video games, and guess what? I'm not even a virgin. Lost my cherry when I was 15. So let's just fuck stereotypes, OK? OK, I'm all for that. And I'm all for breaking up those beers. Who'd you lose your cherry to? My babysitter. What? Not the same one. You two are trying to be funny. We're not! - The door won't open. - Oh God. Do do do do do. Do do do. Do-- Oh, don't leave yet. Who's that? Kapps? Professor Kapps is busy burning in hell. But thanks to you, we've all come. And you know how we do love houseguests. Shall we? Bring it on, bitch? Show me what you got, you mother fucking whore bastards. Do do do do do do do. house! Good bye! Smash your head against the wall. Throw your clothes onto the floor. Rip your arms off and pat your head. Do the zombie dance. Bend your fingers 'till you hear a snap. Pull out your veins and crack your back. Spin your head back. Do the zombie dance. Dance, dance, dance. Do the zombie dance. Do the zombie Dance. Stick a red hot poker up your tush. Smoke from your ears like a burning bush. Run down the street with your head on fire and do the zombie dance. It's Halloween. Oh. Goblins come up from the ground. It's Halloween. Oh. Witches will fly all around. So smell our feet. Let's hit the streets and trick or treat and trick or treat and trick or treat and trick or treat and trick or treat.
