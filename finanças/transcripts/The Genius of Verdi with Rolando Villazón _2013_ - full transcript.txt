# Questa o quella, per me pari sono # A quant'altre d'intorno D'intorno mi vedo...# I am Rolando Villazon and as a singer, I have the pleasure of living and breathing the music of a true genius of the operatic stage. Giuseppe Verdi. # Di que il fato ne infiora la vita... # To sing his music is to connect directly with the human soul, with its joy, its suffering, its force. His music tells us what it means to be human with such truth that watching and listening, no matter who you are, you cannot but recognise yourself. Verdi composed a huge body of music for the opera house, which, today, is performed all over the world. But by looking at just six of my favourites and meeting some of my colleagues along the way, I want to show you why this music has come to be loved by everyone who hears it, how his characters are able to speak to us so meaningfully. # Degli amanti le smanie, derido... # And why he remains, for me, one of the most important opera composers of all time. # Se mi punge # Una qualche belta. # Think of opera and you think Giuseppe Verdi, La Traviata, Rigoletto, Aida, some of the most famous operas in the world. Verdi's long and hugely successful career spanned most of the 19th century. Everything Verdi composed had an impact. The subjects he chose covered a whole arch of the human experience. Politics and religion, tragedy and comedy, power and love. # La mia latizia infondere # Vorrei nel suo bel core... # For me, Verdi was the consummate artist, but he was famously inscrutable. Through his letters, we learn about him as a working composer, but little about the intensely private man himself. He left his ideas and beliefs to be played out through his music. His fabulous tunes reveal a man who knows how to reach out and connect with everyone. # Al cielo, ed ergermi... # People in the street cheered Verdi. People in the street sang Verdi tunes, but I don't think he wants to impress us. He wanted to move people. Absolutely. But one of the gifts of great, great composers is precisely this. Because it is so important to talk, to be very close to the generation of today and Verdi sounds as fresh today as it sounded fresh in his time. Verdi came from a humble background. He was born in 1813 in the small farming village of Roncole, about 100 miles from Milan. His parents were innkeepers. Here, Verdi would have been exposed to the ordinary pressures of life and what people cared about. The family were regular churchgoers and it was as a part-time organist in the local church that Verdi's musical roots took hold. He is so much a child of his country and what it went through, Italy, of the 19th century, at the time when he was born, it was not a unified country at all. It was a number of kingdoms and dialects. The Italian people were subjects ruled over by the Austrians, French and Spanish, all jostling for supremacy. Censorship was commonplace and large gatherings were banned. However, the one place people were allowed to meet was the theatre. The opera scene in Europe wasn't as widespread as it is today. In Germany, Wagner had still to make his mark with his mythical epics. The main focus was in Paris, where the theatrical extravaganzas of Meyerbeer dominated. And closer to home in Milan, the three giants of Italian music ruled. Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini. Presenting love stories or tragedies that audiences expected, told through a formalised set of arias, duets and choruses. # Ah, non credea mirarti...# This was the musical establishment and Verdi knew he had to conquer it to then take the art form to new heights. So, it was to Milan, intellectual and operatic capital of Italy, that he first set his sights and it was here at La Scala opera house, where high society, the movers, shakers and taste-makers met. Publishers, theatre managers, opera houses, you don't get any affection from Verdi for these places. They were necessary evils. Without them, he couldn't write his operas, but he was at their mercy. But the forces of destiny weren't going to give Verdi an easy ride. Aged 18, he auditioned here for the Milan Conservatory, but was rejected. What's more, a few years later, both Verdi's children died in infancy, shortly followed by his young wife. Verdi was just 26. He was completely transformed, I think, by the death of his wife and children, following which he was by nature lonely, melancholic and depressive. The loneliness, I think, gave him this extraordinary desire, urge and need to reach out and speak, which is where his phenomenally populist and popular talent, I think, comes from. Verdi's theatrical career really took off thanks to his persistence and an uncanny ability to know the right people. With his opera, Nabucco, Verdi proved he knew what could capture an audience's appetite. Rousing tunes and powerful theatre. And the Chorus Of The Hebrew Slaves, would assume a much bigger significance later in his life. But for now, the young man who failed to get into the Conservatory was firmly on the musical map and he was hungry for success. Verdi felt he had to find something that set him apart from the rest. One thing that mattered deeply to him was his choice of plots. The subjects that Verdi chose were a platform not only for telling a good story, but most important, one that allowed him to explore themes and emotions that really meant something to him. I find it fascinating that next to his bed, Verdi kept a well thumbed copy of The Complete Works Of William Shakespeare. Here was a goldmine of stories that most of his audiences would not have heard before. Of course, today, everybody in the world knows who Shakespeare was. But in 19th century Italy, illiteracy was common and Shakespeare's work was hardly known. So, for Verdi, this was extraordinary unfamiliar material that inspired him to be innovative and new. Macbeth was Verdi's first Shakespearean opera. Out of the blue, he produced a dark study of power, ambition and evil. There are very few set pieces to break up the action. Instead, Verdi gives us a continuous and theatrical rite. He turned a very complex, psychological drama into a Tim Burton movie. It has its own visual, colour, atmosphere. It's all cries, groans, darkness, mood. There is a whole horrible nightmare world around Macbeth... ..which is physical in Verdi, not only psychological. For me, Macbeth shows Verdi's real mastery of theatre. You understand the stress he put on the theatrical element. You have three groups of witches. Each one singing a sentence. # Che faceste? # Dite su! # Ho sgozzato un verro. # E tu? # M'e frullata nel pensier # M'e frullata nel pensier... # Verdi, on the writing of The Witches, he writes, please, never forget that they're witches speaking. It is almost not singing. You don't need that. Not to sing a beautiful line, but you have to throw the words. THEY SING I think rhythm is extremely important in how Verdi creates, through the orchestra and the combination of all the voices, this very particular atmosphere. Not all the composers can do that. They are a very nocturnal colour. What Verdi will say again, you can describe not only as a colour but really a shade, a particular nuance. By expanding Shakespeare's Three Witches to more than 30, Verdi establishes a dramatic role for the supernatural, as a character in its own right. He was something altogether different, a distinctive mood in music. In music, we often talk about colour, and colour was something of particular importance for Verdi. It is almost as if he created these subconscious layers that define each of his operas, gives them a unified feel, a personality. How does he achieve that? Well, through words, rhythm, melody, through orchestration. Nobody illustrates better than him the inner forces of the characters. Traditionally, the hero in opera would be a tenor, but for this troubled anti-hero, Verdi broke with the norm and cast Macbeth as a baritone. A darker voice better suited to Macbeth's troubled character. One of the biggest challenges is to try and manipulate people through colour, through sound and not just through text. It's very true of Verdi, that Macbeth, so much, is the colour. He's an extreme for me. You don't want any joy, you don't want any pathos, you don't want any sentimentality. He doesn't deserve it and shouldn't get it. The hooded nature of this...filthy character has got to be in the sound, I think. Macbeth, general of King Duncan's army, is consumed by ambition. He has planned to kill the King and take the crown for himself. To take on a new tranche of colours, Verdi reinvented the baritone voice. You have great new vocal vistas open to you. He's increased the opportunities for the baritone's top register by about an octave. He actually, to a large extent, invented modern singing for the baritone. Macbeth was hugely successful. Verdi took the baritone to new heights, but most interesting, he broke with some established conventions. This opera had no love story. However, Verdi's own life was not devoid of love. Seven years after his wife died, he began an affair with soprano Giuseppina Strepponi. Strepponi was a gifted actress and singer who had appeared in Nabucco at La Scala. By the time of the affair, she was teaching young singers, promoting the particular approach that Verdi's operas demanded. And one of the fundamental building blocks to that approach was the significance that Verdi attached to the text. It wasn't what the words sounded like, it's what they meant that he cared about. It's what the words contained. Verdi was dependent on the poets to give him the text that was as vivid as he needed it to be for the kind of music that he wanted to write. The libretto for Il Cosaro was written by Francesco Maria Piave, a poet who was to go on to write the words for 10 of Verdi's operas. He would know full well what Verdi demanded from his text. Verdi was so demanding towards his librettist. He was never happy and he was... "Please, that's too much, that's too long. "You need to be really essential, you need to go to the focus, "you need to go to the essential." Don't attack. But it isn't just the librettist that has to get it right. For us singers, the key to fathom Verdi's intentions, is to understand the drama in the text. Janine Reiss, has coached some of the greatest singers in the business. Domingo, Pavarotti, Callas. It's almost as if one would hear Verdi saying why he chose to compose almost exclusively for the human voice, because it allowed him to work with words. Absolutely. To express through music and the word the emotions and the feelings of the characters. I am a prisoner. What does it mean for a human being to be a prisoner? It means to be separated from the whole world. If the interpretation of the artist is as it should be, you don't see any more of the stage. You are with the interpreter in prison with him. Verdi was really, not only inspired by the text, but he wrote the music of the feelings which were expressed in the text. So you have a score and you have to respect the score and try to go as far as you can to find exactly what the composer wanted. One of the things Verdi wanted most was to give us convincing characters, truly three-dimensional portrayals. For me, one of the most multifaceted is Rigoletto. Here we have a Duke presiding over a bigoted court. There is rape, murder, corruption, professional assassins. It's the damnation of the ruling elite in a complex morality tale. Rigoletto, jester at the court of the lecherous Duke of Mantua, leads a double life. A public one as a cynical foil to jeering courtiers and a private one as the overprotective father to his daughter Gilda. These two worlds brutally collide with the Duke's seduction of his willing daughter. Rigoletto swears vengeance. There is no doubt that for the audiences in mid-19th century Italy, the subject matter was shocking. But it was also a hot potato politically. Rigoletto is based on Victor Hugo's play Le Roi S'Amuse, which shows the French King as a libertine. In France, this was perceived as an attack of the natural order and it was banned just after the first performance. Verdi knew that in Italy he would have the same problem with his opera. Rigoletto was a commission from La Fenice Opera House in Venice, at the time under Austrian control. Their censor saw this as a criticism of the establishment, and subversive. But Verdi was undaunted. He described it as "great, immense and has a character that is one "of the most important creations of theatre". So, to get around the censors, Verdi changed the location from the Court of France to the Dukedom of Mantua, which had long ceased to exist. The elements of the story, however, remained intact. It takes like the tops, the cream of all human emotion, of disgusting, of beautiful, and he experiments with the mix. Like a cocktail, which the public has to drink. Rigoletto is probably Verdi's most significant, most complete and most disturbing opera. It's where he matches brilliantly this Shakespearean idea of comedy, of wit, of humour, interspersed with a great tragedy. Um... And he creates a character of awe-inspiring selfishness. In the first act, Rigoletto is sycophantic and manipulative. And his music is close to the character of the Duke's. In Verdi, the revolution is we have every time, but every time, and it is really amazing, the perfect connection between the character of the music and the drama. Then, in Act Two, Verdi shows us a different side to Rigoletto. The sympathetic and loving father, comforting his daughter after the Duke has had his way with her. Intent on revenge, the last act sees an altogether different, dark side of Rigoletto's character, as he arranges to have the Duke assassinated. Verdi's great talent, that he writes of profound, dark, ugly emotions. He confronts who we are... ..and he does it with fantastically popular melodies that attracts everybody to the material. In the last act, Verdi wrote a tune that perfectly encapsulates the character of the Duke - shallow and two-dimensional. The tenor in the Rigoletto is the lover, but in this case he is a really bad character. He's the bad way of lover. Verdi knew what a hit this would be, banning his cast from singing or even whistling it in public before the premiere. This famous aria is much more than just a hit tune. It shows how Verdi was a master of the theatre. Not only does it encapsulate the Duke's amoral and devil-may-care character, but by the end of the opera, it serves a far more shocking purpose. The assassin has brought Rigoletto a sack. He believes it holds the dead Duke. But the audience knows that it is actually his daughter. And then Verdi delivers the lightning strike. THE DUKE SINGS ARIA The impact is huge. A deeply distressing moment of pure theatre conveyed through a lightweight song. Verdi satisfies the dramatic element, not in any melodramatic way - in a real, interesting, theatrical investigation. He gives you real theatre, not just tableaux. Unable to renounce her love for the Duke, Gilda has sacrificed herself. That courage to put so unsympathetic a man on the stage, ugly not only in body but ugly in soul, is quite fascinating because often it's the ugliness of Rigoletto which lifts an audience to its feet cheering. Rigoletto is a testament to Verdi's skill at fusing all the elements to create a powerful dramatic experience. At the premiere, audiences loved it and it took no time at all for La donna e mobile to be heard in the streets. Aged 38, Verdi was the undisputed king of Italian opera. He was rich, famous and at the height of his powers. But there were still aspects of his life that were troubled. His affair with Strepponi had blossomed, but rather like one of his characters, she had a questionable reputation, having had at least four illegitimate children before meeting Verdi. Verdi took her to live with him in Busseto, the town of his deceased wife's family. Of course, this didn't go down at all well with the small-minded and bourgeois locals, who whilst proud of their famous son, shunned his mistress. Amidst this turmoil, Verdi was still travelling abroad and accepting commissions. In 1852, Verdi was eager to find new material for a commission at La Fenice Opera House in Venice. But he complained that he couldn't find the right subject. He wrote, "It is easy to find commonplace stories, "but it is very, very difficult to find one that has all "the qualities needed if it is to have an impact. "One that is also original and provocative." And it was here in Paris that he found what he needed, a poignant story based on the real life of a tragic young woman. This is the grave of Marie Duplessis, a notorious courtesan and mistress of many wealthy and powerful men. Extremely beautiful and witty, she was a legendary figure of mid-19th-century Paris. But her life ended tragically. She died of consumption at the age of just 23. One of her lovers was the great writer Alexandre Dumas and he was about to immortalise her on the stage. Their short love affair would go on to form the basis of his play La Dame Aux Camelias, The Lady Of The Camelias, which was an instant hit. On seeing Dumas' play La Dame Aux Camelias, Verdi finally found the raw material he had been searching for. The story goes that as soon as the curtain fell, he ran immediately into his apartment and started sketching the music for La Traviata. La Traviata, or The Fallen Woman, is a story that must have had echoes with Verdi's own relationship with Strepponi. At its centre is Violetta, a courtesan, a kept woman, admired but never really accepted into society. But what I think is wonderful is the way Verdi makes the audience not only accept her, but actually care about her. Audiences love her. What I think people love most about this opera, besides the way it's composed, the beautiful tunes and the power of the music, that's number one. Number two is that she ultimately has more integrity than every other character in the piece. And she is supposed to be the one who has the lowest morals and in fact, she rises above everyone else. Violetta knows she is dying, but she lives a life of endless parties, liaisons and lovers. Into her world steps a young man named Alfredo, who offers her a chance of true love. La Traviata is about the choices she has to make between the superficial life she's accustomed to and the sacrifices for love. Passionate, that's what it is. It's passion, raw feeling, raw emotion and ultimately if someone comes to an Italian opera, they're expecting to feel something. They're expecting to have a visceral, emotional, physical reaction to the opera. Not cerebral, not, "Oh, that was lovely," but...in the gut. Alfredo has declared his love, and Violetta is left confused. What follows is ten minutes of some of Verdi's most intimate theatre, as she shares her innermost thoughts with us. I love the way Verdi does this. By putting such a woman on stage, alone, Verdi is pushing us to embrace her predicament as something we will recognise and accept. That's where the drama plays out and where the real story plays out and the questions, all of the sort of - is it this or is it that, is this real love? What about my life? She's completely out of control at this point. And she's fighting the truth, which is that she's already in deep, you know. That's the way love is sometimes, it just hits you when you least expect it and when you least want it sometimes. But by putting a character such as Violetta on stage, Verdi was again going to get into hot water. The Venetian censors and the opera management objected to Verdi's wish to stage La Traviata in contemporary times and in modern dress. It was far too close for comfort. They insisted that Verdi set it at a safe distance, around the 1700s, far from any direct comparison with their own audience. And in the Second Act, Violetta comes up against the same bourgeois attitudes. Violetta has given up her life and is living a blissful existence with Alfredo. Then, Alfredo's father Germont comes to demand that the liaison ends, as it jeopardises his own daughter's marriage. Germont is the representation of the society and the oppressive world in which this beautiful flower Traviata and this wonderful love story is trapped in. It's a world that doesn't allow that to happen. And Germont embodies that. This cannot happen under the rules of life as he understands it. And I think Verdi captures that beautifully. And now Verdi really ups the demands on her voice, calling for a big dramatic sound to express her intense anger. It's the most heartbreaking moment, and the way he does it too, because they're singing and arguing and singing and arguing and suddenly time stops. And just out of nowhere comes this "ah" in the little voice that's completely exposed, and in that "ah" is a lifetime of pain. That moment is absolutely where the opera turns. It's the turning point of the entire piece. Every hope and, you know, she... It's just one of the most heartbreaking moments in all of opera, I think. The Final Act finds her back in Paris, alone, penniless and dying. I think La Traviata is one of the greatest operas of all time. Through the extremes of music and voice, Verdi expresses a wide range of emotion. He captures our sympathy and we care deeply about Violetta's fate. But by putting a classy yet kept woman on stage, maybe the characters were too real for the first-night audience. It didn't go at all well. Verdi himself was deeply frustrated, dismissing the premiere as a fiasco. Although Verdi makes no direct link to the character of Violetta, you could argue that one of the reasons that he felt so attracted to the subject of an ostracised woman was his witnessing of Giuseppina Strepponi's own non-acceptance by society. Maybe through Violetta, he wanted to thumb his nose to the bourgeoisie. It wasn't until a year later, with performances at a different theatre and a handpicked cast that Verdi's La Traviata triumphed. Today it is said that on any night, somewhere in the world, La Traviata is being performed. Verdi was now very famous. The boy from a country inn had become a national icon. By now, Verdi was living with Strepponi at Sant'Agata in a farm deep in the Italian countryside and one removed from society's demands on him. But he was not going to drop out of sight completely. The diverse states that made up the Italian peninsula were going through a period of upheaval, and Verdi himself was to become inextricably linked to this spirit of revolutionary change. The country was beginning to unite under a new king, Vittorio Emanuele II. In 1861, the occupiers were kicked out and a new cry was heard in the streets and scrawled on the walls. "Viva Verdi." Viva Verdi. You know, Orlando, in Verdi's times all of the people were celebrating. "Viva Verdi." Viva Verdi had a double meaning, because Verdi you can use like... In 1861, Verdi himself was persuaded to enter Parliament, a cultural symbol, as the international face of the new Italy. He was not interested in politics as a means of gaining power. He didn't need any, he had it. He was worshipped by his own people. For whom Va Pensiero, which is the chorus in Nabucco has become identified with the call for national independence and national identity. MUSIC: "Nabucco" by Vivaldi Va Pensiero, up until today, it's the most important musical and artistic identification of a country. No? Yes, for a while we consider the possibility to have it as a national anthem. Of course. I think that's amazing. The Italian nation soon however had its critics. In 1864, the Pope Pius IX condemned democracy, freedom of the press and the new Italy as anti-Catholic. Something that would not have been lost on Verdi. Verdi's operas frequently touched on the great themes of liberty, power and politics. None more so than Don Carlos. An epic five-part opera based on a story by the German poet Schiller. But one of the most overwhelming moments is what I think to be a very personal statement by Verdi about the place and power of organised religion. There is a scene in Don Carlos where the king has to choose between his duty to the nation and his love for his son. He goes to seek advice from the head of the Spanish Inquisition. The way the inquisitor is portrayed melodically, and harmonically and rhythmically is everything but evolution, openness of spirit and generosity. It is orthodoxy, it is this kind of unflinching refusal of anything that would be questioning the accepted forms. The grand inquisitor is old and blind. Verdi never explicitly stated his views on religion, but his depiction of the inquisitor is by no means flattering. Verdi is pretty risque with his dealings with the Church and how he portrays the Church. This adamantine, fearsome character in the inquisitor is not a depiction of love, it's an edifice to be feared. The King is asking the inquisitor whether he should kill his rebellious son for the good of the country or spare him out of fatherly love. Verdi's portrait of the grand inquisitor in Don Carlos can probably help us to understand his views on the Catholic Church and formalised religion. Verdi himself was a suspected agnostic, someone that neither believes nor disbelieves. It is quite interesting that one of his most powerful works written just a few years after Don Carlos was Requiem. It was on the death in 1873 of the poet Manzoni, nationalist and fervent supporter of the new Italy, that Verdi wrote Requiem in his honour. Here was a whole new opportunity for Verdi to apply not only his heart, but his well-honed dramatic skills to a different form. A traditional mass would normally be sung as part of a funeral service, but Verdi invested the full force of his dramatic skills for maximum impact. More suitable for the concert platform in a large chorus of mixed voices. Nevertheless, the occasion and subject matter demanded a more sober setting. Even here, Verdi would have to compromise on some things. On the first anniversary of Manzoni's death, Verdi's Requiem was premiered here in the church of San Marco. Since papal convention decreed that no female voices were allowed to perform in church, Verdi petitioned the Archbishop and an agreement was reached. Not only were the women made to wear veils, but they were also shielded by screens. MUSIC: "Requiem" by Verdi It doesn't do in church, because it's a concert piece. But you cannot help, even if you are listening to it in the Albert Hall or wherever, to be moved by the words, the music and what it evokes in your own heart. Verdi set his Requiem for vast forces. Four soloists backed up by a double choir and orchestra. Verdi takes the religious text as a starting point then he writes music that, for me, really seeks to capture the dramatic and emotional force inherent in it. I think his talent was to express any emotional colour and put it into harmony. And to make it and to build a structure in such a way that it becomes visible. You can almost touch it. It's 3-D. Those four chords... They grab you! It's the last day of the judgement. Doors of heaven, doors of hell, everything is open. The day of wrath. Dies irae. All his operatic and his dramatic experience, obviously he put into this piece. He saw this piece in a dramatic way. He had a vision of this last judgement where you have the great contrast between drama, between hope and fear, hope and despair. And I think he touches people. It was a gigantic achievement on his part that was important, first to him because he knew what he wanted to express, but eventually became so important to the rest of the world. But I would say the word, "spiritual" is more adequate than, "religious" because there are many religions, but there is only one spirituality. Verdi wrote the final movement first. In it, the entire journey from judgement to eternal rest is summarised. But tellingly, Verdi chooses not to say where our final resting place may be. With no strength, with no power, with no voice, he wrote the last, "Libera...me." It's like the last breath, when the soul comes and leaves your body. It always happens after the "Libera Me." It meant silence after that, and I thought that's what Verdi wanted. By the late 1870s, Verdi had all but retired. Thanks to the huge popularity of his works and vigorous copyright that came with their performance, he was a very rich and comfortable man. It would not have been surprising if he HAD retired. But maybe he still had something to say. It was in 1879 that Verdi met with Arrigo Boito, a brilliant librettist who was keen on the operatic possibilities in Shakespeare. Given Verdi's own passion for the playwright, this was an opportunity too tempting to ignore. It took eight years, but in 1887, La Scala saw the fruit of their collaboration - Otello. And this is where Verdi really showed what he could do, not just with voice, but with the orchestra. Verdi and Boito, they thought that if you open with a disaster, naturalistic disaster, the people will be inside of the story immediately. Immediately! And they opened with a storm. HE SCREAMS AND MIMICS ORCHESTRA "Oh, my God! Where we are?!" And then the diminuendo. Of course, the evolution of Verdi is bring the people to the drama immediately. The atmosphere and terror of a storm at sea. Verdi uses the orchestra for thrilling sound effects. The people in the audience, they don't know, but he used the organ. HE MIMICS ORGAN WHOOSHING In the organ, uh-huh. Yeah, but you don't understand it is the organ. It is inside. For ten minutes. HE MIMICS ORGAN WHOOSHING But it's something that disturbs you. Then he combines that with... With the storm! Horns, violins, wind... The chorus! And for ten minutes, you are completely... Drawn into this... Drawn in the chair! We're not understanding what's going on. What's happened to your life?! The orchestra is not only telling what is happening in nature, but it is another character. Like, he understood that at some point, he had to change the attitude of the orchestra, or of orchestration. Immediately, he becomes something. Suddenly, he starts to speak without words. The music serves herself. It is joined with the text, but you can do the music without the words. It works. And here is a great example. Out of jealousy, Otello is intending to kill his wife, Desdemona. TENTATIVE, MELANCHOLY STRINGS He walks in, stealthily. Apprehensive and nervous, yet still unsure. Verdi puts it all in the music. And the music tells us his decision. STRINGS BECOME URGENT AND STACCATO Verdi would go on to write another opera in his 80th year. But the last music he composed were Four Sacred Pieces, set for choir and orchestra. CHOIR SINGS Verdi spent the last years of his life mainly in the quiet of the country, back at St Agata. But at the age of 88, the great maestro died. At his funeral in Milan, a vast gathering of 200,000 lined the streets. Verdi remained inscrutable to the last, but I find it telling that, of all the music he wrote, it is said that he wished to be buried with one of these. The Te Deum. "Thee, O God, We Praise." Giuseppe Verdi is the quintessential artist. Not only did he push the human voice to new heights, but through his mastery of text and genius use of orchestral colour, he created pure, intense drama in music and carried the opera from 19th to 20th century. For him, opera was not only for the elite, but should really be for everybody. Today, we can all relate to his three-dimensional characters, but most important, we can also sing along with his wonderful tunes. And that is why Verdi and his music will never, ever die.
