SHOUT ... AND DIE! MCMLXXIII or (The House That Has Disappeared) (Video Title: Scream) Ok dear. It comes. Fantastic ! Do you want to try on the hat? - Yeah, we can try that! Just touch up your lips a bit. Look, I have a job well paid for you. I would like to take nude photos of you for a paperback. I already said no! Why no ? - Because ... no! No for me but yes for other photographers, huh? I saw dozens of photos of you fully naked. The kind of nudes I do for others and the ones you ask for are two different things. - Do you think I'm doing porn? No porn, Kent. Just a little unhealthy. You're so petty bourgeois, huh? - Difficult ! You will not change your mind? - No, continue! It's good ! Ok, be nice, huh? - Look, do you have some money? Save it for school, ok? Come on, let's go! How about we come back tonight? I am dead tired ! I have to get up early tomorrow. Yeah, it'll take a second! Damn it! It's somewhere around here! We will find nothing in this fog. We see that slab! - Shut up ! What's the matter ? - We are here. This is it! Yeah, I'm sure it's there. - How do you know? Keep you busy, that's my problem. Listen ! You stay in the till until I get back. I won't be long. I just have things to recover. What the hell are you doing here? I told you to stay in the box. I was cold, I was worried. I want to go home ! Shut up, behave yourself! - Did you come here for that, then? Drop it, will you? - Terry, I won't give up. I want to go back ... Now! - Look, I don't want to argue. Go back to the car and wait for me! Pig ? Wait in the box until I'm finished. Seen? I was stupid to follow you. - There, you may be right, dear. Damn right! - What are you looking for ? - Shut up ! What is that? - Fucking passports. It's not the right address. - They're just women! So what ? - Foreign passports of young women! A little strange! - Let me see ! You're right ! It's a little crazy! What are we going to do ? - Do not panic ! Let's get the hell out of here! - Too late, someone is there! We should have gone to my place instead of coming here. At least there would have been heat and light. And coffee too! Even if we don't really need light, this place is not ideal for spending a few hours together. It doesn't matter, we're here. You know, you're really strange. You should introduce me to your friends one of these days. I forgot. This story you told me in the car ... You hate people and want to live your life in solitude. If I were the owner, I would sell everything. Furniture and spider webs. And I would buy a nice apartment in town. This is it. Few people take advantage of their benefits. Hey! What is it ? Do not stay watching without saying anything! You know ... It is not easy to get along with you. It will be difficult to find another girl and satisfy your whims and fantasies. We were very lucky to meet. We get along ... very well! You don't want to put out that cigarette? Aren't you even going to take your clothes off? Sorry, can you take me to London, please? Yes, of course, Hey, come on, wake up! Valerie is here! Terry is still involved in shady stories. Business with him always ends in disasters. Maybe I should go to the police? - You're crazy ? To explain to them what? Did you and your boyfriend go to this mansion to rob it? I didn't go to rob! - Do you think they'll believe you? Watch out, you're going to be in a lot of trouble. Terry has disappeared, he may even be dead. It's not his style to disappear so easily. It will reappear when you least expect it. I wouldn't be surprised if he got into a business for himself. Don't be ridiculous, I saw a murder take place in this mansion. It was horrible! - Haven't you seen the guy's head? It was too dark. - Can't you tell if he ... was young or old, or tall or small? It was so fast, I didn't have time to see anything. I don't know, I guess it's my fault. They were in the shadows constantly. - A pouffe he brought back by car. I don't think so, I think from what he said they knew each other. What did she say? - Nothing in particular. She spoke all the time undressing as if she ... provoked him, excited him. He stayed there without saying anything. Strange! - Everyone has their shit! He was there, seated, smoking calmly. Undressing, she approached ... sat on her lap and there he killed her. Like that? They haven't done anything else before? I don't know. I just know that he attacked him with a knife. He must be helpless. - Terry found what he was looking for? Jewelry this time or cash? - I don't know what he was looking for. I think he was in the wrong mansion. - That's funny! There's nothing funny about it. He told me to wait in the cash register. I stayed for a while then I got cold and I was worried. I went to join him. Damn, he was furious! Could you find this place? - Maybe! Not impossible. The fog was too dense last night. If I were you dear, I would relax and wait for the rest. Wait for the rest? - It's the best thing to do. Nothing will happen, but I'm sure it has something to do with Terry. This guy stole one of my photos. He parked the case with Terry at my house. He knows who I am and where I live. I could be the next victim. You don't seem to realize my situation. Honey, we realize that. We're just trying to get a handle on it. Relax, drink your coffee, we will find a solution. This should sell very well, everything will be delivered in a fortnight. I'm pretty busy right now. - If you make sure of everything. These are the photos I want to exhibit in the art gallery. Technically, no problems. I just need time. You said two weeks. Do you want a coffee? - No thanks. I want one. - Come! Valerie, this is Paul. - Nice to meet you. - Hello ! This gentleman created all these masks. - They are superb. I wish I had one. - Really ? Here is my collection. Come choose one, one of these days. - I would like. I give you my number, call me, we will make an appointment. Your number? Just in case you forget to call. I hope to see you again soon. - Okay, bye, bye! Nice boy, right? - Yes indeed. A little shy, actually. You're interested, apparently. He prepares a catalog for art galleries. He creates these masks himself Not bad, huh? - Magnificent! Are you going to call him? - Maybe! At least he won't be worse than Terry. It gives you a hard time, huh? Why do you hate Terry so much? - Come on, darling. I barely know him. I just saw him pick you up in his ... turne. Nobody likes Terry. - Honey, I don't really care about Terry. But ... I don't like to see you here in the morning with a black eye. Another damn photo session. - I promise it won't happen again. I hope that one day you will understand my reasons. All Val rie, this is Paul. I You surprised me, sorry. - I do not bother you? No, it's nice to talk to you. - You liked my masks. I would like to show you the rest of my collection. Can we have a drink? Are you free tomorrow afternoon? Yes, that would be perfect. I look forward to it. Do you really mean it? - Otherwise, I wouldn't say it. 5:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m., bye! Who's going there? Hello, Miss Jennings. Are you ok? - All right, Mrs. Dabney. I hope you don't mind all this mess. This is the site for an apartment that has been empty for so long. The tenant is a bit lonely. He doesn't want to be disturbed. He devotes his time to studying pigeons. Yes, I saw them in the cellar. Someone put them on yesterday. An original hobby. I'm not sure he's the right person. He wants to settle down but the house needs to be redecorated. He doesn't care. By the way, what about your friend, Miss Collins? She's in the south of France, I have to go. Goodbye. - Miss Jennings, good luck with the pigeons. If the breakage is here, the house must not be far! I believe that it must be in this direction. It is a very deserted place. - Yes, and I haven't seen any other houses. There was too much fog. - Here is the car. - It's worse than a labyrinth here. I was hiding there when the murderer approached me. I was terrified. I stayed until dawn. You're lucky he didn't find you, I would have found you. Look, there is a path that leads to the forest. No, I'm sure it's over there. - The house will not be easy to find. Hey, come see it. - It's Terry's car. The one who was near you and now she's here. Let's take a look. The keys are not there. It's a mess. Good evening, it was a pleasure. - Good evening. Valerie, this is Susanna. - Good evening. I hope I haven't interrupted your work. It's an excuse to stop me. My eyes are starting to tire. Very happy to meet you. Do you want a whiskey? - Perfect thank you. Paul met you at the photo studio, did he tell me? You impressed him. Having met you, I can understand it. I thought that Paul created the masks but you are in fact the artist. Paul ... creates the original drawings and I do the rest ... I see. It must take forever, it would drive me crazy. Sometimes it takes several days to work on these masks. But time flies. It is like these statues that the Aztecs do. They are impossible to imitate. - I love Aztec art. Paul, do you remember the copy of an ancient God? It took me 6 months. Design, manufacture, finishes. With all the inscriptions at the base of the statue. The details were perfect. My best job, I think. We finished it, dropped it and broke it into pieces. When Paul was a child, he still is for me, he made superb drawings. My friends said he would become a great artist. What else could they say? - They were sincere, I swear. I'd love to see your head if someone dared to contradict you. If he had studied at the academy, he would be a respected painter. He dragged his feet. - Yes, it got boring. I was too tolerant. Thanks for bringing me back, Paul. - Pleasure. I would love to see you again. Is it possible ? I would like.. I promise not to invite you to have tea with my aunt. Lorna, is that you? - Why lock the door? I have to explain to you. It has been hard since you left. Are you really skinny? - I'll tell you after, ok? I received your card. How was the job? Fantastic ! Wonderful! Glad you came back. There have been weird things since all that. A strange man has moved downstairs. He walks around at night ... and he talks to his pigeons. - What pigeons? Those in his apartment. Mrs. Dabney says he is studying them. This story with Terry is so incredible! You should notify the police. - I was advised to do nothing. You can't leave things as they are. Mike told me to drop it, that Terry will surely come back. What do you think ? - I don't know. I feel like a horrible thing happened to him. This house got on my nerves as soon as I approached it. It is understandable. There is something to be afraid of forcing a house like that. I knew there was a problem. With Terry's plan in particular. Or the trunk was in the wrong place. We may have entered ... the wrong house. - God, it's so absurd! An incredible story. The murderer has seen me, he knows who I am. He knows where I live. And I know absolutely nothing about it. Terry has disappeared. I just managed to escape, veiled, that's all! What are you going to do ? Aren't you going to go to the cops? What are you going to do ? Hello, my name is Hornby. The new tenant from below. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Miss ... - Collins! You enter ? - No, I just came to introduce myself. And for the hassle I caused you with my pigeons. Don’t worry. I was just a little scared when you arrived. Sorry. Did Mrs. Dabney not prevent? - No, indeed. Do not be alarmed if the pigeons are agitated below. I will be absent today and sometimes I leave them out of their cage. To allow them to wave their wings. If they bother you, hit the floor a few times. A gesture of prevention. Not an unfriendly gesture. I didn't know you could live in this apartment. You just have to live there. Do you disagree? It's a pleasure to have met you. I hope we will see each other again soon. A strange man! - Very strange! Any news from Terry? - No ! - Did you go to the police? Not yet ! - And your friend, the mask painter? Have you seen him again? - He called me this afternoon. I told you you impressed him. My God, this guy looks like the delicate type. Don't worry, I can handle this kind of situation. Do not move. There, perfect! So leave her in peace, Paul! You will only have complications, right? Why do you say that ? Am i so weak Maybe more than you should. - More than I should? It's my opinion. In answer to your question, poor darling. Sometimes weakness gives way to cruelty. Why get involved? It's just one more girl! Valerie is different. I have never met anyone like her. She is very ... special. - You always say the same thing. Why didn't you bring your boyfriend? He had to work. He's a little strange. Not very ... sociable! No, yet another? - It's just different. How old is he? - Paul? Very young. - I thought so! But it's hard to say. With his aunt, he is like a child. She suffocates him. Without it, he would be much more mature. In fact, he is very charming. He needs protection. And are you going to protect him? - He won't be worse than Terry! No, they are completely different. - What will Terry say if he comes back? I have a feeling that I will never see Terry again. Come on, Terry is still disappearing from traffic. I'm still convinced it was Terry's hit. Maybe. But I don't really want to see him again. There it’s different! - You say now. You will change your mind when he returns. I do not think so. Not this time. Hi. - Bye. - Bye, see you soon. Whoever committed the murder made no stupid mistake. He knew perfectly well the identity of his victim. She was beaten, raped and strangled with a belt. This proves that the murderer had time to identify him. The door lock was also not forced. He used a key. Besides you and Miss ... - Collins, did others have the apartment key in their possession? Mr Hornby, the new tenant on the ground floor. He has the key to the front door. - Not someone from the building but ... a personal friend or Miss Collins? - Well, I don't think so. It could have rang and no one would have opened it. You n' The keys. Lorna would not have given the keys to anyone. Not without telling me first. - I see. Do you suspect someone? You know ... did your friend have personal enemies? It may be a private matter. - No, Lorna was so friendly. No one could hate her like that. - It's up to us to find out. In the meantime, continue living your normal life. Above all, look for details if you ever have suspicions. If necessary or if you decide, do not hesitate to call this number. But don't leave London without telling us first. Excuse me ? Sorry, Miss Jennings, if only I could help you. It's very nice but no thanks. This way. Sit down. Cigarette? - No thanks. Are these your photos? Can i see them? Go ahead, I'm coming back. I'm going to pack my bags. Excuse me ? I have something for you. This envelope arrived from the post, I took it by accident. Sorry. No big deal. Thank you. - I would so much like to help you. If I can help you, don't hesitate. - Naturally, thank you all the same. Are you leaving for a few days? - Yes. - If we ask you? Where can I reach you? - It's not necessary, just this weekend. I see ! It's good to get out of this house. The best place to rest from all the hustle and bustle. Anyone live here? - No, not exactly. My grandparents lived here. My parents too. I was born here. My father. A very perceptive man. - Do you have a picture of your mother? What did she look like? - Very beautiful. In fact, like you. Thank you. - Don't thank me, if you knew, you wouldn't. Can a beautiful woman like you understand certain problems? Why not ? What is the relationship between beauty and understanding? My father said: "Women have only one path in life". Your father was hard on women. - He had his reasons. If my mother had not been so beautiful, he would not have been hanged that evening. Let's try to eat in the kitchen. - I'm not good at cooking. We will open a few boxes and drink wine. - Perfect ! I redid some masks. - I have what it takes in the cellar. Well, I'm going to get the wine. Stay, don't go stain your stuff. Okay, I'm waiting for you. - Thank you for accepting my invitation. Why not ? - I don't know, people hate old country houses. Not me. I love the countryside. - My aunt Susanna too. Too bad it is not there. Don't get me wrong, she's in town for personal reasons, nothing to do with you. She will be surprised by your coming. - Why surprise? Didn't you tell him? - I said I would ask you. She took it as a farce. - It's strange! Why ? It's complicated. She likes to bore me, has fun. I'm tired of being treated like a child. I sometimes want to tell him. It may be a little cruel. What do you think ? - That it's time you take your independence. Maybe. I'm going to get the wine. Hey, I found some. And a good year. Any problem? - I heard something. Wind. - No, I heard a noise coming from above. Listen ! - I assure you, it's just the wind. I know all the sounds of this house, we are alone. It cannot come from above. It's been closed for years. It is not possible ! Oh my God ! Paul, where are you? It lasted long enough! Paul, stop behaving in a childish way! No need to continue. It's too late ! Come on, darling. What is it, you little fool? We must end now. You have to kill her. There is no alternative! If she runs away, you will be locked up for the rest of your life. Paul, do you know what that means? In prison in an asylum. I should ... not have said that. You're not crazy. Wait Paul, wait, please. I always protected you. You don't see ... that I'm the only one who can save you. Paul, please! Trad: Uncle Jack 2017!
