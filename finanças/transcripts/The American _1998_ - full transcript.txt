[gentle piano music] [Claire huffing] [gentle orchestral music] [dramatic orchestral music] [stopper clinking] [powder splashing] [liquid fizzing] [gentle orchestral music] -[dramatic orchestral music] -[Claire huffing] [Madame De Bellegarde] I ask you one more time. [Marquis De Bellegarde] Never. I gave my word. She marries him. [Claire huffing] A union between two most noble families. Our daughter will be publicly disgraced if we back down. She's a girl. Still a child, still in dreams. No. -[door clicks] -[Claire gasps] Help me. I cannot. Why? Why? That man is vermin. It will be an obscenity. I know de Cintré. [footsteps pattering] I really must insist on the permission of your husband to marry Claire. I want you to have it. I want her now, as she is, perfect and untouched. And she will have everything. My husband is very ill. If you will wait one more day. If I do not have the permission by tonight, my family will withdraw its offer, and you will have a child tainted with rumours of broken promises. [dramatic music] Mama. [dramatic music] [priest speaking in Latin] [lips smacking] [Marquis of Bellegarde groans] [sombre orchestral music] [priest speaking in Latin] [sombre orchestral music] [whispers] I never loved you. [dramatic music] [footsteps pattering] You have your permission. I now have the authority to grant it. Thank you, Madame. I can always count upon the complete obedience of my family. [dramatic music] [Claire whimpers] [dramatic music] [floor creaking softly] [Claire] Please, Mother, no! No! [footsteps pattering rapidly] [curtains clattering] [windows creaking] [Mrs. Bread whispers] Ah! I am dead. [dramatic music] [Marquis De Bellegarde whispers] [dramatic orchestral music] [gentle piano music] [Narrator] Seven years later, a young American came to Paris. -[gentle piano music] -[bells tolling] [carriage wheels rumbling] [Driver] Whoa! [mutters] Sir. [carriage door creaking] -[gentle piano music] -[birds chirping] [horse snorting] [bell rings] [Concierge] Message for Monsieur Des champs. Message for Monsieur Des champs. [bell rings] Yes? What do you want? You short of a tip? He'd settle for his youth. [people chattering] [Concierge] Message for Monsieur Des champs. Well. Now you set him a problem. He doesn't know if he's lucky, or if you're his new best friend. Who are you? Tom Tristram. -Ah, cherie. -Welcome to Paris. Christopher Newman. [Tom] First time ever in Europe? [Christopher] It's that obvious? [people laughing] Is it your hobby to hang out in hotel lobbies and help strangers? Well, it's different here. Besides, I've made the city my home. I'm 100% French. Let me show you around. -[gentle orchestral music] -[carriage wheels rumbling] [footsteps pattering] So, tell me what you did in the war? Did you fight for the North? I did my part, built bridges and such. So, that's how you won the war. How about you, what'd you do? Well, I never could find a uniform I really liked. Besides, I'm a total coward, so I just ran away. [laughs] If you please, messieurs, hush. This your work? Yes. Why do you do it? There's a market for fine copies. How much when it's finished? Oh, I don't know. Perhaps 2,000 francs. Perhaps more. It's much too much, it's just a bad copy. I'll make a deal with you. You finish, and if I don't like it, I won't be obliged to buy it. But if you don't like it, you lose the 10% deposit. Who said anything about a deposit? Done. [footsteps pattering] Frankly, Sir, she is no artist. I like a person who knows how to do business. And I like what I see. [Tom chuckles] [footsteps pattering] [people whispering] [Tom] So, what has you all the way over here? [Christopher] Tired of the money game. Just wanna see the places people talk about. Palaces, museums, maybe the Alps, Trouville. Do you know Trouville? [Tom] Mm-hmm. It's kind of the French Newport. We got there in the summer. [Christopher] Well, maybe I'll get myself there too. Well, before you start crossing the Alps or climbing Mont Blanc, I was gonna suggest we have a cigar by the Palais Gardens. All right. That'll give me a chance to explain how important it is to take your time. What matters is the way you look. All right. First, you gotta get the hang of these clothes. -[suspenseful piano music] -[people murmuring] And then you shoot the breeze, as it were, and that's how you begin to meet folk. [suspenseful piano music] Do you know them? Brother and sister. Who's she? Don't ask. You'd be better off climbing the Alps. [chuckles] So, what do you do with that thing anyway? It wouldn't stop any rain. Nothing, it's just the rage. All the men have it. And if you want to be on prance, that's what they call being suave on things, you'll need one of these. Here, try it. Just hold it like that. Now, that's what I call style. How's it feel? I feel kind of like a dog waiting for a lamppost. [Tom chuckles] I thought you look good. Well, that's 'cause you're from the South. [Man] This, Mr. Newman, is one of our more modest apartments. [door creaking] -[gentle piano music] -[footsteps pattering] [whispers] It's kind of big. Nonsense. If anything, it's too small. It is? [distant horse whinnying] Well, of course if you want something a little more provincial. I'll take it! [footsteps pattering] Christopher Newman, Ma'am. [Tom] My wife Lizzy. -Daddy, Daddy! -Hi, nice to meet you. Tom says you've been odiously successful. Oh, well, I... I'm so-so in copper, fizzle in oil, but I know how to build a railroad. But of course we never talk about it. No. It is always disagreeable to hear how an American makes his money. Right. And you will learn that there are some things that money cannot buy. [clock ticking softly] Listen, if this is the way things stand between us, perhaps I should make my leave. Nonsense, Christopher. Everything that Tom has told me about you, I'm on your side. You will meet everyone we know. [footsteps pattering] [gentle piano music] [brush scratching] [women chattering] [gentle piano music] Can I make an offer to buy these as well? You are impertinent. Just name your price. Monsieur? Here, come. [people chattering] I'm... I'm very touched by your interest in her work. Well, I don't know anything about painting. Well, forgive me saying so, but not an excellent time for you to start learning. Well, maybe I. Are you perhaps interested in a business proposition? [people chattering] I am poor, and it is urgent that I marry my daughter to the right man. I don't have the money for her dowry. To me, it is a small fortune. I am desperate, Monsieur. There's a right man? Well, right man, right background, right age, and employed by an insurance company. [Christopher chuckles] And how much does this right man want down as a dowry? Oh, the price of say a dozen canvases by Noemie. Sir, I'm hardly a patron. I don't know a good painting from wallpaper. But something keeps bringing you back. Perhaps I just like negotiating with an artist. This is hardly a business proposition. But you will consider it? [lips smacking] I'd be seriously obliged if you didn't do that. [bench creaking] [hand knocking] [clock ticking softly] You like what you see? Oh, yes. And you think I'm a good painter? Why do you ask? I like to know I please. I mean, you didn't have to order up the entire Louvre, you know. [footsteps pattering] -[vivacious orchestral music] -[horse hooves pattering] [horse whinnying] [horse snorting] [Driver shouts] [horse hooves pattering] [guests chattering] [vivacious orchestral music] [tongs clinking] -Ma'am? -Thank you. [women chattering] [vivacious orchestral music] [woman laughing] [women chattering] [vivacious orchestral music] [Woman] The painting's enchanting, isn't it? Well, ladies. Ah, Christopher, how very nice to see you. Come this way. Thanks. [vivacious orchestral music] -Oh, he's very nice. -What is it? Ladies, may I introduce Christopher Newman. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you both. Charmed. Excuse us. [women laughing] Do you want to be a lamppost or do you want to be dove? Show some interest. [Woman] Madame de Cintré. [gentle piano music] [lips smacking] [Henri] Good evening. Speak to you soon. [guests laughing] [vivacious orchestral music] There's someone very much looking forward to meeting you. She's the only duchess we know. [vivacious orchestral music] Oh, it's very nice to meet you, Duchess. May I kiss your hand? You certainly may not. It's very old fashioned, and it's a ridiculous thing to kiss at the best of times. So, you are the one who made a fortune. Yes. Yes, I'm here for the great history, the paintings, the cathedrals. Commendable, nothing else? Well. Maybe if I get lucky, I'll find a good woman and marry her. Even more commendable. How long have you been here? A few weeks. Well, you do disappoint. I mean, you must have found something more lifting in Paris then go stump around a cathedral. You need to discover something more cheerful, like a touch of depravity. This city's quite good for depravity. Yeah. Excuse me? You are young, rich and handsome, and all you want is a wife? My dear man, you may as well have me. [giggles] [men chattering] What about her? [laughs] No, set your sights on something more realistic. You know, Lizzy, I think you make a very good matchmaker. [Lizzy laughs] [man laughs] It was when I was losing that I realised it didn't mean anything to me anymore. Money was no longer important. I still had more than I could spend, so I decided to get out. When my driver brought me to the ship, he asked me, "What should I do with your coach and horse?" [laughs] "Keep them," I said, "they're yours." [guests chattering] Has he finished his story? I think so, General. I do believe he's told me a funny story but it all went in my bad ear. I missed every word. Young man, if I give you my good ear, would you mind repeating it all? Gladly. I didn't see you laughing, pretty lady. Well, I can't swear to you it was funny. It ain't a funny story? Not intentionally so. Then you can save your breath. [man laughs] [Man] Serves you bloody right! [people chattering] What did I do wrong? Young man, on second thought, if you are still interested in an old cathedral, I really must show you Notre Dame. Excuse me. [gentle orchestral music] Who is she? We went to the same convent school. She's been a widow for many years now. She only wears black. We don't know what she's still mourning. What's her name? Claire de Cintré. [gentle orchestral music] [guests chattering] [man snorting] How delightful, another young man. I've been dying to meet you all evening. Excuse me. [footsteps pattering] [gentle orchestral music] -Hello. -Hello. I'd like us to meet. I'm afraid that would be impossible. So, I've been told. I'm leaving for the country with my family. The house is to be closed up, the shutters are down. And all the mice are in chains. [gentle orchestral music] -[guests chattering] -[women laughing] Delighted. Good bye. Thank you for coming. -You have a good evening. -Young man, why don't you come with me in my carriage? I'm sure there's room for the two of us. Duchess, thank you for coming. How delightful. [Lizzy] Good bye, lovely to see you again. [guests chattering] Are all Americans like this? Hands here, hands there, hands all over? I guess we're just a friendly bunch back home. Whatever you are. I'm sorry, I was rude. Forgive me. No, I don't think I will. You may call upon me. Thought never crossed my mind. At an appropriate time. Claire. [gentle orchestral music] Good night. Wouldn't you be safer in Milwaukee? [sombre orchestral music] [woman moaning] [woman moaning loudly] What is it? Put your clothes on. Please. Just go. Why? Do as I say. Is it something to do with my body? No, of course not. So, is it something to do with me then? I admire you. You like how I paint. I admire you for that, but it was wrong of me to confuse that with-- With making love to? My god. How any man can be so stupid? You seem to be saying that everything between us is to do with art and painting, and that's it. Nobody but a fool who jumped out of a Christmas cracker would sensibly buy my stuff. I can't believe you're so stupid. I'm ignorant, but I'm not stupid. What a lesson I've learned. There you are then. Your Titian, Rembrandt, Veronese, whatever. All copies, not the real thing. Maybe I'm just not good enough. Thank you. [door thudding] [bell tolling] [horse hooves pattering] I was put in there as a child. That's how I knew Claire. The nuns never quite let you go. If the outside world fails you, the convent can take you back, and make no mistake, they will always want you back. [horse hooves pattering] [sombre orchestral music] [footsteps pattering] -[sombre orchestral music] -[horse hooves pattering] [horse hooves pattering] The family have certain signals, be afraid of the mother. If Madame de Bellegarde insists you must stay for more tea, remember, she means it is time for you to go. Thank you, Lizzy. [horse snorting] [sombre orchestral music] [crow cawing] -[footsteps pattering] -[crow cawing] [sombre instrumental music] [hand knocking] [door thudding] [sombre instrumental music] They don't like foreign ways. [sombre instrumental music] Mr. Christopher Newman. [footsteps pattering] [sombre instrumental music] The American. [sombre instrumental music] [doors clicking] [teaspoon clanging] So, then you made your first fortune? I did. In wash tubs. [Valentin] Washtubs? Yes, soon followed by another fortune. Really? Yes, bars of soap. White soap? Yellow. In small oblong shapes? No, flat round ones. Every turn a fortune? Yeah. Then I decided to get out of the washroom and invest in railroads. I went out West and laid tracks, clean across the prairies. Do you know what it's like to sit in a train and watch the prairies go by? Couldn't we leave the prairies a moment and talk about art and books? All right. No. So, there's been no time in all this rush to money, no time for titles and such like? Oh, I have titles. I have titles to so many properties. I mean you haven't bothered to become Duke of California or? You misunderstand me. The only titles that I presume to are the titles of deeds, title bonds, and the rightful titles of properties. Believe me, young man. I know exactly what you're saying and what you insinuate. I don't seek a quarrel. Sometimes it is almost a duty to quarrel. And how difficult it must be for you to understand my way of life. I'm sure I could learn. You realise I cannot go out and make money because of my position. No, I did not. And no member of this family has ever married into the bourgeoisie. Valentin, please. That must rule out a heck of a lot of people. We are of such stock, if any one of us negotiates directly with a tradesperson, he is condemned. Stop now, Valentin. I don't think I can, you see. My son paints a very convincing portrait of us all. That's right. It's so convincing, I can see no change ahead for 100 years. So convincing. I don't have a penny in my pocket. I'm too noble to borrow a cent. And do you know, I'd rather be dead than live another day longer under such a fine tyranny! -I swear to you! -Enough, Valentin! [footsteps pattering] [door creaking] [door thudding] Now, Mr. Newman, I must insist you stay for more tea. Thank you, but no. [saucer rattles] Always a pleasure to meet a visitor. Have you been to -the Tuileries Gardens? -No. Cake. Cake, Mr. Newman. Can I offer you some cake? And you've been to the Louvre? Yes, it's most impressive. Mr. Newman, may I offer you some more tea? No, thank you. It has been a pleasure. [footsteps pattering] [saucer rattles] [sombre orchestral music] [whispers] When can I see you again? [footsteps pattering] Perhaps we can do something together. Mr. Newman? It's been a pleasure. [footsteps pattering] It's good you've come. [footsteps pattering] [cheery orchestral music] [Valentin shouts] [water splashing] [cheery orchestral music] The American! [water splashing] Excuse me. I know this gentleman. [Tom] You must be mistaken! I'm Valentin, remember me? I'm afraid he doesn't. Yes, yes, yes, he does. I'm Valentin, the Count de Bellegarde. Never heard of him. [Tom] No, sorry, he has no recollection. No, okay. No, I. I can understand how you feel, honestly. [groans] Sir. -[Valentin shouts] -[water splashes] [Valentin grunts] Whoa! Whoa! I behaved so badly. You must understand me. I'm bred to behave like that with strangers. I just say the first thing that comes into my head, and then I prattle on with what I feel before I have a chance to think about it! I was bred like that. Sir. Sir! -Take it easy there. -Yes. Oh! I accept your apology. [Valentin panting] Thank you. [sombre orchestral music] [thunder rumbling] [clock ticking softly] -[door slamming] -[door creaking] [Tom] Well, you know my wife. [men chattering] [men laughing] At least you can swim. [laughs] Noemie. you know Tom Tristram. Don't you dare speak. I've brought the rest of what the American ordered. I'll take my money and go. [footsteps pattering] You know perfectly well the only agreement I thought we had was something to do with our hearts. I'm not good enough for you, and you want to wrap it up with some newly made dollars. I want nothing to do with your dollars. [coin purse thuds] I spit on you! [clock ticking softly] [coins rattling] [footsteps pattering] Ma'am. [door creaking] -We better get you warm. -[door slamming] [clock ticking] I'm in love. -[Christopher sighs] -[throat clears] Valentin, tell me something about your sister. Claire? Yes, just throw me a crumb. [Valentin] Well, she's perfect. Is that it? [liquid splashing] Well, she's my elder sister, and I've know her all my life. Although she's perfect, but she's also a pain in the neck, if that's what you mean. No, it isn't. You don't stand a chance. Why, is there somebody else? Something like that. You realise that only makes me more determined. [laughs] You're a damn fool, Christopher. [rain pours] Just tell me who that girl is. -[dogs barking] -[sombre orchestral music] -[horses whinnying] -[carriage rumbling] [cane knocking] [dog barking] [sombre orchestral music] [dog barking] [Christopher] Ma'am? Mr. Newman. Madame, I was just passing by and I-- What a surprise. Yes, it is. I regret that nobody is here. Excuse me? [footsteps pattering] The Bellegardes are never at home to visitors who arrive unannounced. It is a ridiculous rule and quite out of step with the times, don't you agree? [footsteps pattering] Good day, Mr. Newman. [Mrs. Bread whispering] Mr. Newman. [footsteps pattering] [sombre orchestral music] [dog barking] You race ahead of me, Sir. Well, time is a precious thing. You must not go on like this, charging in and... I apologise if I've done-- It's not so much me. Oh, no, what is it? Christopher, almost everything you ask of me is out of the question. I haven't asked anything. Everything you say is so inappropriate, and my mother will stop you. Everything you do, you confuse me. What... What is it you want? Hope. [footsteps pattering] [sombre orchestral music] [birds chirping] [door thudding] [footsteps pattering] Yes, I am poor. And I can't expect you to understand. [footsteps pattering] [sighs] But a true nobleman looks at money with the proper contempt. It's only small round rattling things. -[Valentin sighs] -[liquor splashes] I mean, my ancestors are Knights Templars. Ancient codes of gallantry, secret passwords. Imagine what it's like to be so superior to everyone else, and not have a roof of one's one. I think you're trying to ask me a favour. Something about a roof being mended? -[birds chirping] -[footsteps pattering] A nobleman may have moments of dire emergency. I am your most loyal ally in the whole of Europe. May I have a spare key to this apartment? In exchange for what? In exchange, I will do all in my power to bring my sister to you and convince her of your qualities. This is a business proposition. -[footsteps pattering] -[keys rattling] Between one tradesperson and another. [keys jingling] It's completely beneath my principles. -[water splashing] -[birds chirping] -[sombre orchestral music] -[birds chirping] Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho! I do not want you out of my sight. I must have a clear vantage point from which I can see you at all times. Yes, Henri. No hands. -[sombre orchestral music] -[birds chirping] [Valentin muttering] Valentin, um. See you later, Henri. [sombre orchestral music] Valen... Valentin. Suppose I'd come to Paris 10 years ago. We'd never have met. I still would have looked for you. But you couldn't possibly have found me. You'd never have been invited to the house. You think that would have stopped me? No. [sombre orchestral music] -[Christopher grunting] -[basket rattling] You play cards? -I play bezique. -Bezique? What's that? Pansy game. Do you play poker? No. [glasses clinking] Valentin! -Valentin! -[oars rattling] What are they doing? Nothing. [sighs] Thank you. [Henry gulps] Valentin. Valentin, pull this boat in this instant! Valentin! Valentin, come back here! Valentin! [bird hooting] I bet your mother plays poker. Never. Why, not quite classy enough for her? Christopher. Real players are something special. They can lie and bluff and hold out to the end, when all they got is a hand that ain't worth a dime. [birds chirping] You mother plays, she may not know it, but she's a player. Are you? Well, not in the league of your mother, but there were times when there wasn't much else to do. Watching the great prairies go by. Yes. [bird hooting] Tell me about America. Well, the town where I grew up was changing all the time. The road went past our porch, past a few more houses then it came to a stop, right there in the middle of nothing. As kids, we used to walk out to the end, gaze out and say, "Wouldn't it be a good idea if we built the road on a bit? "Maybe even connect it to the next town." [sombre orchestral music] I've got this feeling that you and I should have been together a long time ago. Do you have that feeling? [sombre orchestral music] The more I think about it, the more I imagined I've missed great moments. Moments when you and I should have been together, sitting on my porch, looking at the moonlight. Or you could have been my partner on Independence Day. We would have danced all night. But I wasn't there. [sombre orchestral music] It would have made both our lives a lot easier if you had been. Maybe we'd be married now. [sombre orchestral music] Listen, I've made money. It was a kind of loneliness that I never want to have again. [sombre orchestral music] Here's an easy one. Cherokee Indian poker. [sombre orchestral music] Cherokee Indian poker? Bet your two-bit derriere on it. Bet my two-bit derriere? Bet my two-bit derriere and throw in my bald granny's glass eyeball. [laughs] I bet my two-bit derriere and my what? [both laughing] Ah, shucks! [Claire laughs] All right. [clears throat] Here we go. What are they doing now? Nothing. How long can they do that for? [Valentin grunts] Another glass? [birds chirping] [teeth crunching] This man you were married to. I don't want to talk about him. -But. -And he's dead now. What happened? You talk about marriage as if it's some kind of a natural human journey. It wasn't for me. I couldn't have lived one more night with him. He died. Now, you come along, crash, bang, prairies and washtubs. [birds chirping] What have you done to me? -[wind blustering] -[leaves rustling] -[footsteps pattering] -[floor creaking] Mr. Newman, Madame. [footsteps pattering] It's kind of you indeed to see me. I'd hoped, of course, to see Claire, as well. -Alas, I'm afraid-- -She isn't here. Of course she isn't. Henri. Mr. Newman, your specialty lies in the manufacture of things. It certainly does. So, we must not discourage you from what you do best in life. This isn't what I came to talk to you about. No. No, I came to talk to you about your daughter. Isn't she beautiful? She gives me hope. [Madame De Bellegarde] Oh? That she will one day consent to be my wife. Will you favour it? Favour it? Will you suffer it then? Mr. Newman, this family is one of 100 that goes back directly to the Bourbon kings. We know each other and we only marry one another. No doubt you find it absurd. I love Claire. That could have its disadvantages. My mother means that while she may not favour you, she will on the whole suffer you. We must not be seen to quarrel. Sometimes it's almost a duty to quarrel. We understand that you won't take no for an answer. Perhaps you should understand, Sir, that we cannot surrender. Nothing will make me back down. But you will never be a member of this family. My mother is very tired. You will, of course, stay for tea. No, thank you. [sombre orchestral music] [footsteps pattering] Christopher. I want to tell you something about the one you love. You know she was married a long time ago. It was an arranged marriage. The husband died shortly afterwards but, while they were man and wife, certain abominable acts took place in the bedroom. And these things, they just became a routine. They were indescribable, but that's why she can't touch another. [suspenseful orchestral music] Why are you telling me this? Because I'm not prepared to stand by any longer. When she was born, I was the first to hold her. I know her. All her life. And I know that she loves you more than she's loved anyone in that life. Where is she? [sombre orchestral music] -[footsteps pattering] -[horse snorting] [carriage doors thudding] [Christopher sighs] I'm afraid. -So am I. -Go on, girl! [tongue clicks] Go on! [horse hooves pattering] Claire, I'm not that other man. I know. Try to find in me something quite different. Someone perhaps a bit rash but... Claire, if we can't touch, what can we do? Stand around under parasols and wear gloves. No. [laughs] [horse hooves pattering] [sombre orchestral music] Christopher. How many buttons do I have on my waistcoat? I don't go around counting waistcoat buttons. 10. [Claire] All right, 10. [sombre orchestral music] One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Do you want to play buttons? I love you. [sombre orchestral music] [horse hooves pattering] [couple moaning] [couple moaning loudly] [Valentin laughing] [couple panting] -[lips smacking] -[gentle instrumental music] [lips smacking] [footsteps pattering] [lips smacking] I have to go. I'll find some money, I promise. [Noemie laughing] How dare you march in? How dare you do that to me? I spit on your grave! I live here. And what has that got to do with it? [door clicking] May I ask, do you two belong to some sort of ancient secret society which sort of hurls abuse at each other soon as you meet? [sombre orchestral music] [horse hooves pattering] The American. -The American. -The American. [sombre orchestral music] [candle wicks crackling] [footsteps pattering] Be careful, Christopher. Mrs. Bread, you worry. [lips smacking] -[door clicking] -[door creaking] Long life and happiness and every good thing that goes with it, Sir. If only my husband were alive to witness the family's delighted meeting. The American. -The American. -The American. Mr. Newman. [footsteps pattering] [whispers] I'm sorry. The Chevalier is a longstanding friend of the family. [Chevalier grunts] Chevalier, this is the young American. [Chevalier mutters] He never left his own country till now. [Chevalier mutters] And so brimming with confidence. [Chevalier slurping crudely] [spoon rattling] [Chevalier muttering] The Chevalier says, the delightful thing about Americans is... [Chevalier mutters] the speed with which they come and go. It's very nice to meet you. [horse huffing] [Seller] Madame, Monsieur, these are our two fine horses from Normandy out of Javron by Count de Granges-Menac. These four year olds have full warranty from their owner, 15 hands and 16 hands. Sound alive, sound of pop, never been sold before. The stable lads welcome your inspection. A wonderful offering at 1200 for the pair. -[horses snorting] -[guests chattering] Who is he? That thing is the Chevalier. My mother produces him like a rabbit out of a hat when certain problems arise. [Christopher] I don't follow you. He's like an old faithful dog you can always rely on. Don't you think he's a treat? He'll marry Claire the moment he's asked. Hello, Pierre, how nice to see you. -[horse hooves pattering] -[horses snorting] [people laughing] What makes me different from the Chevalier? [Valentin] A vast estate in the north. They're very strange up there, totally inbred. He does things like stick spears into otters. Is that it? Well, the point is, he's got an ancient family name. But don't fret, apparently he's incapable of the sexual act. -[horse hooves pattering] -[guests chattering] [footsteps pattering] -What's going on? -I can't talk to you here. Why, what's he doing? Who? The big man who does things with otters. [Claire chuckles] I feel like I'm drowning here. Does he love you, do you love him? Christopher, there are some matters love has nothing to do with. [lips smacking] [man laughing] [Seller] Count Grandcourt. [horse hooves pattering] [suspenseful music] Noemie, what are you? Be perfectly calm. I'm at ease with the rest of the world. I'm gonna kill him. [Valentin whispering] [man laughing] [Noemie] Valentin, no! -[gloves smacking] -[Noemie screaming] [suspenseful music] I assure you, Sir, my brother means no harm. [footsteps pattering] My brother's a boy, he'll apologise. Too late. [footsteps pattering] Come on! [horse whinnying] Claire! Get in Valentin! [Christopher] You don't have to go with them. -No! -No. No, you're with me. Everything is different now. -Claire. -Claire! -Why is it? -[horse whinnying] -Come along. -I have no choice. -Here. -Fast! By the Rue Maupassant. Driver. [Valentin] Drive on, you fool! [suspenseful music] [driver shouting] -[suspenseful music] -[horse hooves pattering] [insects buzzing] [key sliding] -[door clicking] -[body thudding] It's Henri de Bellegarde! Those are yours. Valentin wants me to give you them back. He will have nothing more to do with you. Where is he? I don't know. Duels are forbidden in France. They must find a place to do it. [door slamming] They met for five seconds, now they're gonna try to kill each other? It's a custom which cannot be denied. Is he any better in a fight than you? No. Wouldn't it be simpler if this guy just took Valentin to court? The Bellegardes never go to court. Going to court is a thoroughly American affair. You like your honour, don't you? Your shame and your sense of guilt? We live by a moral code. It gets to you when a stranger sneaks in. You don't know where this chap's been and now he wants your sister. I can understand you are mystified by us. What is the point of this warthog with the bad table manners? -The Chevalier-- -She doesn't love him! She isn't expected to. And he is one of us. Well, at last a straight answer. And completely civil. [footsteps pattering] Good morning. [door thudding] [liquid splashing] [Valentin] Oh, god. [footsteps pattering] [suspenseful music] [pistol clicking] [pistol blasting] [bird wings flapping] [pistol blasting] [Valentin groaning] [solemn orchestral music] [Valentin panting] -[door slamming] -Where is she? -She's out. -When will she be back? I can't say. [footsteps pattering] Mr. Newman. Mr. Chevalier, Sir. Yes? [Christopher] One question. What? Are you capable of sexual relations with another person? What an outrageous suggestion. I know, but are you capable? I certainly am not. Not? I never could. I cannot now and I never shall. It's something my late parents and my entire family are very proud of. [suspenseful music] I'm absolutely certain she's not here. Just tell me which room you're absolutely certain she's not in. First landing, second door on the right. [suspenseful music] -[necklace rattling] -[footsteps pattering] [doors creaking] [footsteps pattering] It is customary, Mr. Newman, to close up a house in the summer and leave this stifling city. All prepared without your permission. You see, Claire and I have reached an understanding. About what? Christopher. What has she said to you? [Madame De Bellegarde] I told her these dreams you have. What has she done to you? Claire has been persuaded by a greater truth. She belongs in the world into which she was born. [footsteps pattering] I did warn you. Is that it? Since you entered our lives, Valentin has been dragged down by some whore you introduced him to, and now his life is in danger. You cannot disguise the level at which you wish to live, that is my persuasion, Sir. That is what I have told Claire. I won't give her up. -[thunder cracking] -[horses snorting] [dog barking] Driver, wait! Well, tell him to go direct. [Driver shouts] [thunder rumbling] Drive on! [horse hooves pattering] -[rain pouring] -[footsteps pattering] [puddle splashing] [footsteps pattering] [suspenseful music] Jesus. [sombre orchestral music] [Mrs. Bread mutters] Rest. [Valentin groans] Friend. [blood dripping] You don't look too well to me. Indeed, you look quite ill. Oh, no, really. You look like a man who's given up the fight. Rest now. They've stopped it, haven't they? I'm fighting back. No, they're clever. They have this power. [Valentin coughs] I must have said words. [Christopher] Unwise. I told him maybe what I thought about his father's unusual relationship with various farm animals. [laughs] [Valentin coughs] Always blurt out the first thing that comes into my head. What's that old thing doing here? There is an immense secret. Something was done in the house. [Valentin panting] I don't know. I've been ashamed. Afraid to know. My father, something was done to him. What about him? You tell him. You know everything, tell him what happened. [door thudding] [footsteps pattering] [rosary beads rattling] That's definitely a bad sign when he turns up. [sombre orchestral music] What do I say when I meet God? Hush, shh! [Valentin] No, tell me! Say the first thing that comes into your head. I've been rash. He'll understand. -Are you sure? -Yes. [whispers] The first words, nothing less. [sombre orchestral music] [lips smacking] [sombre orchestral music] [priest chanting in Latin] There was a letter. Madame de Bellegarde insisted on that marriage. It was the same for her when she was a child. All the families did it. Her husband, the old man, he was quite ill then. He forbade it because he knew what that man would do to her. [suspenseful music] [letter rustling] [Christopher] "My wife has poisoned me over these last weeks. "It is because she wants our daughter "to marry against my will, I forbid it." [Marquis De Bellegarde Voiceover] Tonight she has finished her work. I am put to death, it is murder. Housekeeper, Mrs. Bread, is my witness before God. Signed by me, Henri Aubigne de Bellegarde. [Marquis de Bellegarde exhales] [sombre orchestral music] Why didn't you take this straight away to the police? I was afraid for my life. And Claire was never told? If she knew, it would destroy her. Why did Valentin want me to know this? This is your big chance. You must use that letter as you see fit. It gives you the power to do as you want with them. [footsteps pattering] [lips smacking] [solemn vocal music] -[latch clicking] -[door creaking] [footsteps pattering] [clothes rustling] -[solemn vocal music] -[footsteps pattering] [footsteps pattering rapidly] No, no, no! -[feet stomping] -[lips smacking] Please! No, no, no! No, no! [screams] [solemn vocal music] [horse hooves pattering] [footsteps pattering] My very dear friend, without an appointment. After the funeral, my daughter went back to her old convent school. It is a place for holy orders. May I ask why? She loved her brother. You do allow people to grieve in America? You've packed her off to the nuns. So, it's down to God now, is it? I have something I'd like to say. [Henri] [scoffs] Can it possibly be anything worth listening to? Madame, seven years ago you killed your husband in this house. Really? Unfortunately, your husband knew what you were doing. My husband was barely conscious those last days. And he signed a paper before he died. Nobody else was in the room at that time. He died of natural causes. To say otherwise is preposterous. Don't you dare tell me what is in the history of my life or any other member of this house. Nobody else was there. Shall we begin by taking this through the courts? It's a macabre lie. What has brought you down to this? I understand what you're doing. Your life has taught you to use these desperately low measures. And you presume to think that this is how you will enter my family. You've done me a great service by revealing so much. As for the document, if it even exists. [sombre orchestral music] My mother sacrificed her life to sustain this family. My father never loved her. It was an arranged marriage and she came with the furniture. What would you do, send her to jail? If need be, yes. [Henri] And what would all this to do with Claire? That's between us. It is my role to protect what we have left. So, beware of me my friend. [footsteps pattering] [suspenseful orchestral music] [objects rattling] [suspenseful orchestral music] [sombre orchestral music] [carriage rumbling] [footsteps pattering] It wasn't easy to make this visit. I'm flattered. [footsteps pattering] Will you show me the letter? I'd be quite willing but-- Don't imagine I would destroy it, Sir. [letter rustling] Everything my husband wrote is true. Thank you. But you can know nothing of the real nature of my life with him, what I endured, what was forced upon me. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? We do business. I cannot. I'm willing to destroy this paper on the following terms. I will not deal with a blackmailer. You may call me anything you like. What shall I call you? Please. [Christopher] Can you bear the disgrace? Do you want Claire to find out that you murdered her father and why? No. I want you to release whatever control it is you have over Claire. Never. Then I'll destroy you. [footsteps pattering] I agree. I want official public notification of the wedding, and I want you to swear to me in whatever blood you have that you will never tell Claire what you've done. I swear, she will never know. [gown rustling] [flame crackling] You have taken my right to live according to my rules. You've taken Valentin, now Claire. I have nothing left. [flame crackling] [solemn vocal music] [rain pouring] [solemn vocal music] [birds trilling] [carriage rumbling] [footsteps pattering] [horse hooves pattering] [carriage door thudding] [solemn vocal music] [hand knocking] [solemn vocal music] [gate clicking] [gate clicking] [footsteps pattering] [solemn vocal music] [Christopher] Claire. [footsteps pattering] I know you think I'm hiding from you, but I'm not. I chose to be here, Christopher. You could have sent word, instead you just vanish. You said to me once that all the mice were in chains. Well, not anymore. I've spoken with your mother. There are no more obstacles. You think of me in such a way. It does me a great honour. My love, look at me. Look at what happens around me. Why am I the cause of so much unhappiness? It is as if I do not have the right to happiness. Now, now you know why I am afraid. I'm cold. No! [sombre orchestral music] [lips smacking] -Come with me. -Christopher. I'll go to your house, get those things that you need. And then I'll come back and get you, but this time we leave. [lips smacking] [footsteps pattering] [sombre orchestral music] -[suspenseful music] -[horse hooves pattering] [carriage door creaking] [carriage door slamming] [footsteps pattering] -[water dripping] -[dog squealing] [footsteps pattering] [sombre orchestral music] [door creaking] [footsteps pattering] [sombre orchestral music] [woman snoring] [footsteps pattering] Where are they? Madame left for the country this morning. I saw her carriage. What is it? I shouldn't have come back. Where is Henri? Is that it? He's still here, isn't he? Sir, I can't tell you what I fear. [footsteps pattering] [gate creaking] [gate rattling] [horse hooves pattering] This is how they are. Do you know how many years they've been doing this to each other? How many centuries? [footsteps pattering] I want you to know the true circumstances of your father's death. Why your mother was driven to it, our mother. You must know that he was murdered. No. There was no other way our family could survive. If we cannot live by our rules, we perish. [horse hooves pattering] -Come on! -Yah! -[horse hooves pattering] -[whip smacking] -[nuns squealing] -[horses neighing] Whoa! Whoa there! [suspenseful music] [Claire sobbing] [sombre orchestral music] [wreath rustling] [hands pounding] Open up! [Claire whimpering] [glasses clinking] [liquid hissing] [scissor snipping] [scissor snipping] [suspenseful music] I never loved you. -[footsteps pattering] -[Claire whimpering] -Shh, shh, shh, shh. -[Claire whimpering] [Monsieur de Cintré grunting] -[Claire screaming] -[men grunting] [fists banging] -[Christopher] Open up! -[scissor snipping] [scissor snipping] [footsteps pattering] What have you done? You've told her, haven't you? [grunts] You and your rotten family! You locked her in here with all your shame and scandal! Let's be civil about this. [men grunting] [suspenseful music] I'll be completely civil. [Henri] No, please. [whimpers] No. [whimpers] [sombre orchestral music] [footsteps pattering] Claire! [sombre orchestral music] [footsteps pattering] Claire, what have you done? [sombre orchestral music] Claire. These things that your brother said, they don't matter. Come away with me. Come away with me. No, I do not want to be in the outside world. Do you suppose I could live there and not be with you? Do you understand the shame? What shame? Christopher, you have given me so much, but let me go. Let me dream. [stammers] Do you remember what you said about the past and how I was never there with you? I remember nothing. Remember, you talked about me not being there on the, on the porch and the moonlight. Perhaps now I can be there with you in spirit. And those other places, where were they? My love, tell me for me. [mutters] A rail car on the prairie. -I can be there, what else? -[lips smacking] A dance on Independence Day. I can dance. [lips smacking] Now, we know each other, no matter how brief. Perhaps you can see me there with you in all those places even if it is not real to you, allow me that. I can be there, always. [sombre orchestral music] [Christopher huffing] [footsteps pattering] -[sombre orchestral music] -[shoes scuffing] [carriage creaking] [tongue clicking] -[horse hooves pattering] -[sombre orchestral music] [Narrator] Finally, he is the young American who let the Bellegardes go. Out of his good nature, after they had held him there in their power but at what cost? [sombre orchestral music] The shutters are down and all the mice are in chains. [sombre orchestral music] [fire crackling] [sombre orchestral music] [horse hooves pattering] [driver muttering] [sombre orchestral music] [sombre orchestral music]
