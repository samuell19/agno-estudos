[sombre sounds] [ominous sounds] [footsteps] Dieter, if you haven't found the hotel in 5 minutes, I'll turn around and go back to Bitterfeld by foot. Why? It's rather pretty here. You promised me romantic days in London. Castles, beautiful landscapes... [low-pitched screaming] [growling] Was that you, Dieter? I'm afraid not. I bet it was the hound of Blackwhite Castle! [growling] The beast that has killed many lost hikers. I read it in the SUPER TABLOID the other day. [wild growling] [quiet panting] Aren't you a cute one? -[whimpering] -At least he can read humans. Dieter, don't run so fast. We're on holiday. Do you even know where you're going? You've got the sense of direction of a disoriented blind ox, that hasn't got any sense of direction. Don't listen once, Don't listen twice, don't listen thrice... Don't listen 10 times... Don't listen 582 times... Don't listen 2583 times... Don't listen... Why of all the losers of this earth did I have to marry the king? Everyone warned me. Mum warned me, granny, granddad, my brothers, our neighbour, the whole national security. [mysterious sounds] And I even said: "Dieter, buy a new map!" [ominous organ sounds] Good evening. Dubinsky. That's the Black Abbot, you fool! No? So are you the Weird Countess? Whip-August With the Pointed Hat? [moans] "The Monk With the Whip." I see! We really could have guessed that, Dieter! Sometimes I'm just so slow-witted. [dramatic sounds] [honking] And presto, he was gone! Just to be fair, I do have to admit that it was very dark. And the monk was only dimly lit. [suppressed screams] On the other hand: If he had crossed a crosswalk... [suppressed screams] Doris? Doris? [fast music] [evil laughter] [gunshots] [continues laughing] The Wanker Who is the Wanker? The Wanker strikes again! A city in panic! - I am NOT the WANKER! London in the stranglehold of the Wanker! Wanker still at large - Scotland Yard helpless WANKED OFF! KILL THE PIG! Wanker strangles wire-haired dachshund This is what the Wanker looks like on the inside! Bussi Bär vs the Wanker! Inspector killed - Scotland Yard is done for [silence] Yard Chief Inspector Even Longer - chasing the killer by himself? Very Long exchanges yo-yo for police uniform Inspector Very Long reaches required standard! Hot sex games with the Wanker Crazy! How to dress like the Wanker! [title music continues] The Wanker - Success is sexy! The Wanker - Why does he not go the the East? Who is the Wanker? Englishmen have tiny wieners! [title music stops] A monk has been murdered? Oh, yes, I understand. Yes yes. Yes... And send regards to your husband. Yes. Until then, James. -Miss Minipony? -Sir John? Where the hell is the Chief Inspector? I need my best man on this case. [ostentatious music] [snoring] [music continues] [music stops] -Morning, Sir John. -Dear god, Even! You look gross! Thank you. You know what? You should stop letting yourself go like that. I know how much the whole thing with your partner got to you. [dramatic sounds] Rather Short is dead. And I couldn't prevent it. That's right. But still. You should finally stop mourning him. The whole thing was so long ago. When did he die again? -Last Tuesday. -There you go! And you know what? I've got something that is guaranteed to cheer you up. -You have cancer. -No. I have a new partner for you. A wonderful good morning. I am so happy... Have you completely lost it? He was the best at police school. And he's really cheerful. Exactly what you need in your current state of mind. ...happy to finally meet you. Whoops, my bowler hat. Well, as long as all the vitamins aren't gone. Gentlemen... Inspector Very Long, Chief Inspector Even Longer. I'll do everything to be a perfect partner for you. My last partner has died. You can start with that. I can see you two have chemistry. By the way, Inspector Long won last year's yo-yo derby. Attention please! The window. Peekaboo! -The Eiffel tower. -Yes! And the toothbrush. Bravo! I'm going home now. So let's begin, my gentlemen. The monk with the whip was murdered. One of the most wanted criminals of this city, and now victim to a crime himself! Let me guess. No sign of the perpetrator. Not entirely true. This time, we have a witness. Take a seat. This is Dieter Dubinsky. A tourist. -He's from east Germany. -My condolences. Please. Well, you know, it was like this... We were walking through the forest. And then this monk appeared. And then he was run over by a truck. Hold on. You said "we". Is there another witness? Yes, Doris. But she disappeared, too. Why didn't you tell us from the start? I'm sure you're busy enough as it is. I'm assuming she just drowned somewhere in the swamp, and that's it. Did you get a look at the driver? It was this weird bone-headed guy with a top hat. [dramatic sounds] The Wanker. He's been tyrannising the city for years. About time I finally get rid of that bastard. Don't you mean "we", sir? [auspicious music] [sighs] My first crime scene. And it's immediately in the air, the rotten smell of crime. I haven't had time to shower this month, yet. Do you have a problem with that, Mr. Clean? No, of course not. Someone as busy as you... There are days, when I myself only manage to shower once. But speaking of health. Even lungs have an expiration date. -Morning, Dr. Brinkman. -Ah, Chief Inspector! And? What have you found out? I haven't concluded all tests, but everything is pointing towards the monk being run over by this truck. I understand. He can't have died long ago. -The body is still warm. -No, that's just the motor. A few of the guys went to the petrol station earlier to get sausages. -Hello! -Bon appetit! [dramatic music] Guys, I can't work like that! [music stops] Do you know who owns the car? -Not yet, unfortunately. But... the cover of the driver's seat is made of Peruvian llama fur. A few of the guys are on the plane to Peru as we speak. Good job. -Have you checked the license plate? -Here. Painted tin plate. But... there are millions of it. Basically every car has one. [Long] Chief Inspector? I believe I've found a rather decent clue. [Longer] "International Tampons". "Harry Smeerlap GmbH, London in England, 12B at the Thames". "Probably has to do something with the whole thing." My people must have overlooked that somehow. My, my. Harry Smeerlap. aka Laus Linski, aka Fritz Karaldo, aka Horst Feratu... [mysterious harp sounds] Let's talk to that dodgy Mr. Smeerlap then. Later. First I want to go to the location of the monk's death. Blackwhite Castle Not in London - but in England [sinister string sounds] Pommeroy... Fitzgerald. The monk is dead. We desperately need a new accountant. -Are there no candidates among the applicants? -They're all amateurs! It's unbelievable what the employment agencies are sending us these days. Here. This one is called "The monk without whip". Well, it's just missing something. [evil chuckle] "The smurf with herpes". He looks too mean. [loud splutter noise] [ringing laughter] Pommi! Fritti! How am I supposed to run a business of girl trafficking with two imbecile sons and a dead accountant? The times have changed. Women don't let themselves be humiliated by their husbands or in brothels anymore. -Instead... -On TV? Right. -And that's why we export... -Talk shows? No! Girl groups. [high-pitched female voice] ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ Oh yes, I do ♪ Stop. Stop it! Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Susan, first I'll tell you what I enjoyed. Absolutely nothing. And now, what I didn't like. Everything else. We'll call you. [shrill shrieking] But my ladies, please, please. Don't take this personal. This is just a casting. Excuse me, Mr Cockwood. Okay, maybe Sue didn't sing all that well. But many of us didn't do that much better. Mandy... [Shrieking] -Anything else? -Why is everything so grey here? I could have just stayed in Bitterfeld. I can only sing in colours. Blackwhite Castle is one of the oldest estates in England. And one of the last remainin castles in black and white. No wonder we're not doing well these days If all we get is shoddy merchandise. You can't blame Deaf Jack for that. He's blind after all. I originally studied to be a hairdresser. [Cockwood] Oh... Those were the good times, when he was collecting the girls. [harp sounds] [sirens sounding] [Cockwood] Look who it is. Chief Inspector Even Longer himself. [mysterious sounds] Welcome to Blackwhite Castle. The game is on. [dog barks thrice] [stern and staccato] Hello. What can I do for you? Scotland Yard. We would like to talk to the so-called lord of the castle. Please. March in. [ominous sounds] [Cockwood] Ah, visitors. -And my favourite inspector at that. -Chief Inspector, I do insist. May I introduce the venerable Earl of Cockwood. Last night a scary monk died right in your back yard. Are you missing one? Let me think... no. I hope I could help. Have a nice day, Gentlemen. Not so fast, Count Dracula. We do have a few more questions. -Please follow me. -My colleague will handle that. -That's you. -Oh! me, me, yes, me. I'm going to take a look around in this dump. -I could be your Führer. -Not this time. Mister Long? [quiet] Buy me some time. Please follow me to my office. And you, feel right at home. [sombre string music] "Trap Door". "Trap Door"... Of course, trap door! You said you've never seen a monk with a whip around here, Sir? Inspector, if I may speak freely... In pug breeding we don't deal with whip- wielding monks very often. Understood. It's just curious that a witness saw this exact monk leave your estate right before his death. Well, maybe he was a tourist... The monk. Hatler, did you leave the trap door open? No! That would have been extremely dangerous, with it being that deep and having poisoned spears at the bottom. Hello? Is someone still alive down there? Hello! [dramatic sounds] Thank god, we thought you were dead. Luckily I was able to hold onto some cobwebs. That's an antique trap door from the 12th century. We still need it. Für Jehova's witnesses. Duty calls. My apologies. [romantic orchestral music] May I introduce myself? Jennifer Pennymarket. -I was hired because of the pugs. -That's what I thought. At Blackwood Castle, we have been breeding Great Britain's most noble pugs for centuries. Wellington's victory over Napoleon in 1815 wouldn't have been possible if his light pug brigade hadn't put the French ulans to flight. They're really insane!. -Does the haulage firm Smeerlap ring a bell? -Never heard of them. Yummy. [Incomprehensible mumbling] What? I said: How curious. In the Times it says you're the main shareholder of the firm. -Another cookie? -Mhm. We mainly breed pugs for hunting, decoration and fighting here. But of course also simply for consumption. Do you have any further questions? Uhm... yes, I do. Do you have a boyfriend? But Mister Inspector. [fart noises] [further farts] Shh! Well, Miss Pennymarket, you were telling me the yearly pug harvest was due, which meant... -Who is this disgusting frump? -That's Miss Drykant. Our mysterious housekeeper. I was just shooing away a few dust mites. -We heard that! -Inspector? [thunder rumbling] you have no idea what grave danger you are in. Why? Do you have another one in you? We are all under immense pressure. But Miss Drykant and I, we have to go back to our work now. Do you want to know anything else? Not really. Although... [slurping] [menacing sounds] [with relish] Ah! Where were you at the time of the murder? Do you know who I am? Of course, Sir. On the other hand, I've heard that you only bought the title "17th Earl of Cockwood". Before that, you sold used cars in Soho and were called Freddy Fartface. Your wealth stems from the pug breeding of your second wife, Lady Blackwhite, who died of a heart attack shortly after you got married, while she was drying her hair. How dare you? I did not marry my wife because of her pugs! -[Pennymarket screams] -What was that? [continued screams] Jennifer, calm down! -What happened? Ask the Chief Inspector. I simply asked her whether she has a boyfriend. Yes, for the 7th time. Gentlemen, it would be better for you to leave now. ["Looking For Freedom" by David Hasselhoff is playing] [Song fades out] Something is fishy at Blackwhite Castle. What do you think? [lisps] I think you are blowing it again my dear. Rather! But I thought you were dead? I am. And it's your fault. Because you didn't help me. -But I... I... I did... -It's your fault. It's your fault. [screams] Chief Inspector. everything is alright. You fell asleep in the car. You were just dreaming. Rather Short is dead. Yes, but you have me now. And we will stay together forever. For all eternity. [insane laughter] Chief Inspector. everything is alright. You fell asleep in the car. You were just dreaming. -Really? -Yes. Pinch me, will you? [groans] -Thanks. -My pleasure. [relaxed lounge music] The perfect disguise. I bet that's not what's inside. Period pads -What can I do for you? -First, get me a younger waitress. -He didn't sleep very well. -Are you gay or what? A glass of water and the Pinocchio ice cream please. And what does Friar Tuck want? Ethyl alcohol. I hope it makes me go blind. [laughts] Cute. How about a little games night? [distant shouting] Smeerlap. I'll get him. Pinocchio ice cream. Smeerlap, old greasy bastard! -Who left the prison doors open? -Ah, our dear Chief Inspector. If you had announced your visit, I would have baked you a cake. If I had known I'd run into you, I would have drunk more. Do you still blame yourself for not being able to save Inspector Short? Shut up, shithead! Well, spit it out. What are you smuggling here? Maybe these gentlemen could help you with your questions. [heroic electric guitar sounds] Okay. You think you're very smart, don't you? But I bet, none of you knows the third binomial theorem. (a+b) x (a-b) = a²-b² Long! Oh my god. I'm coming! Could I have the bill, please? [fast rock music] Five pounds. -I get 5 pence change back. -I'll have to unlock the till again. please hurry, it's a matter of life or death. Could I get a receipt, please? Like I said, I'm in a bit of a rush. Want buy rose? Ha, ha, ha. [scream loudly] [rock music fades] -[attack cry] -Olé! The Fat Shark. [auspicious sounds] Good night, Chief Inspector! [Longer screams] -[Long] Chief Inspector! -Shit, goddamned. Chief Inspector, where are you? Ui, ui, ui, I arrived just in time, didn't I? You stupid civil servant-asshole. I'm being killed here, And you munch your stupid Pinnocchio ice cream with no sense of urgency. Have you been told you can be rather angry at times? Untie me or I'll show you I have an urge to kill at times! What's your problem? Can you not tell that you've locked away your feelings in an emotional freezer? Your heart is as cold as a... ...fish finger. The nicest thing you have ever told me was: "You can take my coffee, it tastes like shit." When was the last time you laughed? -Ah! -Oh! Whoops. [menacing music] [low voice] Hey! -Yeah! -Oh no. [evil laughter] [the Fat Shark screams] Bye, bye, Shark! [evil laughter] Evening, folks! The Masked Frog If I find the bike in the hallway one more time... The Janitor With the Cord Hat The Ass With Ears Want buy rose? The Band of Terror The Stupid Archer The Black Colourful Abbot She just washed her pink knickers in the same load as my frock! [groans] [music fades] Gentlemen, during the last few weeks many of our dearest and meanest friends have been killed most gruesomely. [virtuous harp sounds] [clearing of throat] Excuse me. The Forger of London. strangled with an Indian cloth. [enraged murmurs] The Fish with the Scythe. Drowned! Yesterday... Our beloved Monk With the Whip. [upset chatter] And just a few hours ago... -The Fat Shark. -[Frog] That really takes the cake! -So we will be next? -Silence, Gentlemen. -Please, please, please. -[voices go quiet] [dramatic trumpet sounds] Sup, you old criminals? London's underworld has a new ruler. Me. Either you leave all your business to me and disappear or you will be destroyed. The day will come when all humans will be equal. The day will come when all humans will be Wankers! Your times are over. Those who don't pay will be liquidated. [evil laughter] [upset chatter] Gentlemen! Are we going to let a single criminal destroy all our lifetime's work? Guys, these threats must be taken seriously. We can't just let him whip our asses! I don't care in the slightest what you losers do! The Masked Frog cannot be blackmailed! Maybe I should talk to the Wanker. I'll come clean. The whole world shall know who is terrorising us. I will go public with everything I know. Goodbye, you cowards. Applause! Applause! Applause! [melancholic music] [music fades] Huh, buddy? How are you? I still don't know who the Wanker is. [emotional piano sounds] But I have a new partner. God, how I hate him. Us two... we were a good team. Like Holmes and Watson. Tintin and Snowy. Winnetou and... Winnetou two. You were more than a partner. You were a friend. Everyone loved you. [cheery guitar music] [music fades] Don't you finally want to tell me what happened, Sir? Alright. We were chasing after... -Talking about it helps. -...after the Wanker. -It feels good to have someone -We were tipped off. -who just listens to you. -I understand if you don't... -Shut the fuck up! We were tipped off. The Wanker wanted to blow up a teabag factory. But this time we got the drop on him. After all these years we finally had him surrounded. Rather Short chased after him immediately. I wanted to follow, but I just couldn't get out of the car. Rather was out there by himself. And I ran, as fast as I could, to come to his aid. But for some reason I didn't really advance. The time seemed to be working against me. Then my damned shoe became untied. Sometimes everything comes together. And then suddenly... [gunshot] I heard a gunshot! I saw Rather collapse, injured. [distorted] No! In that moment, not only a factory was destroyed, but also my life. After I had hauled him out of the flames, I did everything I could to bring him back. Breathe! But it was too late. My best friend was dead. Executed by the Wanker. Why did you run in slow motion, sir? I can't remember. [quietly singing to himself] [the door is opened] [unintelligible stutter] Even. What did you find out? Smeerlap smuggles girl groups to foreign countries. By order of Cockwood. Did Smeerlap confess? Yes. No. What I'm trying to say is, he almost did, but before that he was able to flee. And what about the Wanker? So far all of the evidence leads to Blackwhite Castle. [metallic clattering] If what you are saying is true, Dubinsky is in grave danger. Let's not lie to ourselves, Sir John. The poor bastard is as good as dead. So far, none of your witnesses have managed to get to the court room alive. Most weren't even recognisable. Well, don't worry, Mister Dubinsky. We will manage. Yes, yes, you can do it. Tell me, Dubinsky, do you miss Doris much? Which Doris? Your wife. Do you really have to remind me of that now? The evening was so much fun until now. [loud knocking] Who could that be? Noone knows that we're here. Hide. Who's there? [woman] Please open the door. It is very important. [thunder rumbles] -Miss Drykant. -Yes. May I speak freely? Now you may. [fast music] [Sir John] We found a piranha between the bones of the Fat Shark. With a collar. And it definitely belongs to Cockwood. [tires squeal] Shit! -Tell me. -Oh, it's a long story. Our audience does not have enough time. I'm giving you 45 seconds starting now. [slapstick keyboard sounds] I had an affair during the war with the previous Lord Blackwhite. I got pregnant and had to give birth in secrecy. Then Cockwood killed Lord Blackwhite during a fox hunt and married Lady Blackwhite to inherit her wealth. But the rightful heir is my daughter. Seven seconds left. And so Cockwood wouldn't hurt her, I had to abandon her in front of a convenience store. I understand. And that daughter is none other than... [weird keyboard sounds] The Wanker! No. And that daughter is none other than... [weird keyboard sounds] Miss Pennymarket. I never told her that she is my daughter. Why? According to the will she may only inherit the money on her 21st birthday. Well, and when is that? Tomorrow. [thunder rumbles] [dramatic orchestral sounds] [orchestra goes quiet] [chirping] [thunder rumbles] [barking] [knocking] What can I do for you? Letting me in would be a good start. If you don't mind me saying, You look miserable. As if overrun by a Russian reconnaissance tank. Thank you. You're very sexy, too. Where is Cockwood? His lordship was about to go to bed. Asshole. Chief Inspector. What unexpected pleasure. Would you like a glass of hot pug milk? Can you imagine. Someone was tinkering with my car. It appears someone cut the clutch cable. -The brake hoses. -Hm? It could have been those too. By the way... do you know him? Rexie. Where did you find him? Between the gnawed-off bones of the fat shark. You won't believe it, Chief Inspector, but just yesterday all my beautiful diptail piranhas were stolen! You can tell me that at the Yard. You're under arrest, Wanker. You don't have proof, Chief Inspector. Yes I do. -No you don't. -Yes. -You don't. -I do! -No. -Yes! -Where? -In my office. -At the Scotland Yard? -Where else. -Let's drive there. -Sure. -Let's go. -Right now for all I care. -Alright then. -Okay. [thunder rumbles] Could we use your car? It's in the shop at the moment. Well, call a taxi then. I'm afraid that the phone is dead due to the thunder storm. [phone rings] I suggest I lock myself in for the moment. And you spend the night in our guest room. I'm going to ask Miss Pennymarket to look after you. Sweet dreams. I still don't understand the thing with this Aldi woman. Miss Pennymarket. Please understand. If Cockwood finds out, she is as good as dead. [sighs] I'm going to call Sir John. [Knocking] Finally. My dinner. Howdy. Lay the table please. I'm going to wash my hands. Yes, Sir John. It's Inspector Very Long. Inspector Very Long, yes. We recently met in your office. I'm the guy with the yo-yo, remember? Don't... I have important information for the Chief Inspector. Miss Drykant was here. What? Yes, it's Tuesday today. No, he goes to the Anonymous Alcoholics on Thursdays. What? Pardon? What are you saying? He already is at Blackwhite Castle? Yes, pay attention... listen. I have important information. It's about Miss Pennymarket. She's actually none other than... So... What smells so good? Uhm, Miss? I think the wine has a cork taint. I am so happy to see you in one piece, Chief Inspector. Well... I do still feel rather tense. Why don't we both get undressed and you give me a massage? This is your room. How curious, something is different. That's the newest addition to the castle. We call it the coloured wing. A small concession to our female personnel. You wouldn't believe how difficult it is to put make up on in black and white. I bet it is! Good night. If you need anything else, just call me. Why don't you just stay here? That way I don't have to call you. But Chief Inspector. We've known each other for so long. Just call me... Chief. Good night. Chief. [sinister orchestral sounds] [ominous music] [menacing hisses] Good evening. I have just finished preparing some terrine vegetable broth. Want some? [loud bang] What was that? Double-action revolver, caliber 38, bent barrel. [Gun shots] -I've got something huge in my trousers! -Inspector! It's a damned rattlesnake! Holy cow. Just give me a moment. [faint hissing] Did you enjoy it as much as I did? What's all this noise? This man had a snake in his trousers. I think the beast bit me. Do you think you could suck out the poison? Let me do it. I know how. No, it's okay, I think I was wrong. I think we rather leave our guest alone now. Miss Pennymarket will look after him. Have a good night. Come, Chief Inspector. I think I know something that will relax you. So do I. [Pennymarket moans with pleasure] [romantic orchestral music] I love this show. There just aren't enough talk shows. Don't you agree? I think there's too little love in the world. ...the questionable nickname "Rebel of the London underworld"... Who is that ugly man? Mister Masked Frog, You announced, with rather much grandeur, I thought, you would let the public know about the true identity of the man who has been terrorising all London for months now, the identity of the Wanker. I stayed silent long enough. Today I come clean. On the other hand: Are you not afraid of the Wanker's revenge? Hm... Or that you can't deal with your sudden popularity? That you make false friends, who get you to take nudes, which damage your career, so you can only perform at town fairs and opening ceremonies, which leads you to take drugs, so one day you'll be found dead in your hotel room, drowned in your own vomit? I don't care anout anything of that. I know who the Wanker is! And today the whole world shall know! The Wanker is none other than... [dramatic sounds] [evil laughter] How tragic! At the height of his career. Chief Inspector, you rotten loser, You will never catch me, but I'll catch you. I'm the Wanker. I wear a thousand masks. I'm everywhere and nowhere. [evil laughter] I'm sorry, I have to go. Maybe I can help you with that. [fast music] [female voice] You have arrived at your destination. Miss Pennymarket. Jennifer, there you are. I am so glad I have finally found you. I have to tell you something very important. I have wanted to tell you for years. But I wasn't allowed. You are the daughter of the previous Lord Blackwhite. And I... I am your mother. But you have to be very careful. Because Cockwood can never know! I won't tell him. Cockwood. You monster! You disguised as Jennifer to deceive me! Disguised? This is what I wear when I go to bed. I can't believe it. The mutt-bitch wants to contest my rightfully scammed money! Yes, she will. Because the money is hers. And I'm going to tell her. But first, I am going to strangle you! -Who? -You of course. -Jennifer? -No, you. -Me? -Exactly. Hm... [dramatic orchestral sounds] [she groans] [music fades] How tragic... She must have been a beautiful woman once. About 100 years ago. -Cause of death? -I'm still not sure. But my guess is passing away. A boat from the Captain Birdseye fleet fished her out of the Thames right next to the Fishy Fingers. How unfortunate that she's dead. She was the last one who saw Long and Dubinsky. I've been saying it all day. Let's finally turn the castle upside down. Even, I know you believe that Cockwood is the Wanker, but our hands are tied without a search warrant. The Earl has already complained about you. -Give me proof... -Okay, let's get Smeerlap. This time of day he's always at the Fishy Fingers. At the Fishy Fingers? That nefarious pub at the Thames? That sleazy hotbed of whores, harlots and prostitutes? -Of what? -Hookers! In that case I'll come along. We should hurry. The damn fog is getting thicker. [foghorn sounds] [Incomprehensible chatter] [Longer] One more time. I go inside and take Smeerlap to task. [Sir John] And I handle the prostitutes. [Dr. Brinkman] I'll take care of the hookers. [distant fighting sounds] [quiet saloon music] It's never busy here before 11. What cheek! Is that how you treat your mother? And my walking frame? Ouch! [piano music and fighting sounds] Want buy rose? [shouting] What? On Mayfair again? How am I supposed to pay for that? You all want to fuck me up! -You are all insane! -Hello, Harry. Go to jail. Go directly to Jail. Do not pass GO, do not collect £200. [screams] [exciting music] [metallic bang] [screams] How sad. Our dear Very Long dies in the dark crypt of Blackwhite Castle. And his drunken colleague behind a cheap dockland pub. Go on, pull the trigger, but will you shut up! Diewell, Chief Inspector. [Gun shot] [dramatic orchestral sounds] Haha! The Wanker. The good old wooden leg. So your stupid little accident at Harrods's escalator was good for something. You miserable coward. Finally take of your stupid mask. You finally put one on. I could kill you here and now. But first I want to see you suffer a bit more, when you lose someone else you care about. -Long? -I was thinking of Miss Pennymarket. My small, ignorant, naive millionare, who is going to marry me tonight. -I will never let that happen! -What are you going to do about it? I'm going to hold my breath until you... So be it. [evil laughter] [Dubinsky] I spy with my little eye something beginning with... Wall. Well aren't you a smartass. Gentlemen, I beg your pardon. You must think me a bad host since I don't look after you. What are you doing with us? I'm going to retire, announce you as my successors and shower you in gold and wealth. Thank you so much. That's very nice. I'm assuming there's a catch. I have to kill you first. What is your plan for Pennymarket? Do you want to kill her, too? Much more diabolical. I'm going to marry her. [dramatic sounds] [Sir John] Even! Even! [Dr. Brinkman] Give me five minutes, and I'll tell you his cause of death. I'm fine! I'm fine. Even! You are alive. Watch out! You can never tell for certain without an autopsy. I have to go to Blackwhite Castle immediately. If you still need proof... It's lying over there. Can I never just call it a day? I like nice puzzles like that. We didn't have those things. Sit up and take notice. When the candle here has burned down by two inches, the flame burns through a rope, which sets this small iron ball rolling. It hits a stone which sets off this row of dominos. The last domino hits the record player and starts it. And you hear: "Il Linguini Prostituto" by Bussella Mussolini. When she reaches the high C note, a glass of wine bursts, and the cube of sugar dissolves. And the result... flying sparks! That lights the fuse for wonderful fire works and the funny little monkey. And the last sparkler over here... Wait a moment, I think you lost me. What's the purpose of the monkey again? Well, it claps. -It's just excited. -Oh, yes, okay. The last sparkler burns through his thread, and chop-chop! The guillotine blade is released. It chops the head off and sets off the alarm, which wakes up the pug. And when the pug wakes up, it will be hungry, of course. And then it eats its food. And when the bowl gets empty, the seesaw is lowered and pushes the final button, which sets two dozen arrows off that pierce your vital organs. End of the show! Well done indeed. With a lot of eye for detail. Guys, why don't you just shoot us? But we've already set up the whole machine. Yes. So let's go. Let the show begin. Stop! Hold it right there!

[Alarm goes off] Can we please continue celebrating? [Rattle] [Pennymarket screams] [Hatler] Who ordered this blackout? Hatler! Push! Can someone finally turn on the light? Asshole. [Dubinsky] Pug, don't bolt your food. -Stupid dog! -Enough now! Let it go! Puggy! Puggy! Come over here! Puggy! Come! You've had enough. Come! [hysterical] Yes! Yes! [they keep yelling hysterically] Well that didn't work out. Chief Inspector. You have saved my life. Shit, you are right. [Bells ring] The monkey was really good. [Cockwood] That's rather unromantic, but I swear, we'll make up for it. For now, let's just get married. -I'd rather die! I hate you! -Oh, I get that all the time. Look on the bright side. Hate is a great basis for a functional marriage. The Chief Inspector will never let that happen. And neither will I. [Dubinsky] Bloody mess. Do they really have to shit everywhere? Do they not have better things to do? [Beep] [Quiet female voices] [Whining] [Quiet] Hello there. Hello, my ladies. Dubinsky. [Doris sings clear as a bell "My Bonnie"] [stops] A male visitor. Don't say a word. You are 30, slender... ...and you're from East Germany. -And you stepped in dog poo. -Doris. It's me. Dieter. Dieter! It's me, Doris! I know, I know! I have come to your rescue! Of course. I have just arrived. And already you come running. After all those years. And now that I'm on my way to be famous, you come crawling back. I can just leave. Yes. Do it. I had the time of my life here. Yes, yes. [Doris sings (badly) "My Bonnie"] [Startled yelling] [Startled yelling] [Bells jingle] -Who are you? -I have to warn you. I'm with the police. And I have a gun. -Honest? -Indeed! And a big knife. And also an AK. -And a bomb. -I don't stand a chance! That's right. Give me Pennymarket. I'm going to marry her. No, that's not how it works. I had the idea first. What's going on all of the sudden? Why does everyone want to marry me to death? -He just wants you for your money. -And if I say no? Of course we would have to prepare a prenup. And what if I get a divorce tomorrow? Stop it! Come with me! Whoa there. Where would you like the bullet to go? Head? Or do you prefer the heart? Or maybe... Whoops. Well, I would suggest... head. [Gunshot] -Drop your weapons! -[both] We already have! Okay, hands above your head then! I told you, Scotland Yard always wins. Whoops. [dramatic sounds] [Pennymarket screams] [Energetic music] Hurry up! This will all detract from your wedding night. [Cockwood laughs viciously] [Pennymarket squeals] [Wanker laughs viciously] [Music stops] [Honking} [Energetic music] [Evil laughter] [Pennymarket screams] -Ouch! -[Chuckles] [laughs loudly] [screams] [ominous sounds] [Shouts and motor sounds] [Intense music] [Music stops] [menacing sounds] Do you want me... ...to tell you, just before... ...I die, who the Wanker really is? Yes, that would be very nice. I don't have the energy anymore. I hate fish. [Pennymarket screams] [fast music] [screams] -[screams] -Hold on! [both scream] Thank god, we had a soft landing. [Longer] His number is up. -Chief Inspector! -This is the end, Wanker. -The wanking's over. -Oh well. Strange, it suddenly smells like it used to in the girls' changing room. Chief Inspector, enlighten us. Who is hiding behind the mask? In the early stages of my investigations I already knew that the Wanker not only knows London's underworld extremely well, but also that he knows a whole lot about me. Only someone from Scotland Yard could know about my wooden leg. And none other than our own boss. Sir John. Even? There you are. Have you finally caught the Wanker? So? Who is it? Well, it can't be you, Sir. No, the Wanker has to be someone who knows his way around Blackwhite Castle. How else could he have stolen the piranhas. And so it suddenly came to me. As always in stories such as this one the perpetrator is of course the nice butler. Hatler. You called me? [Wanker grunts annoyed] Of course he had to be ruled out because he's wearing a mustache. But then I had another theory. I believe I've even written it down. What the Chief Inspector was trying to say was... Maybe the Wanker could never be caught because we were looking for him among the usual suspects. But what if this whole time he wasn't someone alive, but someone dead? None other than the tragically deceased... Inspector Rather Short. [dramatic sounds] -Well. -Want buy rose? -Hahaha... -Rather. You're alive. [lisps] Hello, Even. I hope you didn't mourn me too much? But... But I held your dead body in my arms. Your severed head in my hands. Oh, Even. How did you manage to become Chief Inspector? It's all so, so simple. When I chased after the Wanker by myself because you were too stupid everything suddenly came naturally. I caught him, I unmasked him, and once he stood before me without a mask I immediately killed him, of course. And then I had the idea that would change my life. Why not trade the miserable existence of an underpaid police officer for the dazzling world of super criminals? It was my opportunity to escape from my bleak everyday life forever, and I jumped at the chance. And do you know why everything worked out? Because you ran in slow motion. Why did you do this to me? I always thought you sucked. To be honest, I hated you. But what is there to hate about me? Your looks, the way you move, the way your speak, your tight clothes, your stupid jokes, your fake laughter, the way you smell, the way you look... -Okay, okay. I've got it. -I hated all of you! I don't even know you. Inspector Long, take him away. You'll never catch me alive. The poison of the mamba scorpion kills in three seconds. Farewell. Three, two, one, over. Correct. So, what did I miss? The Wanker killed himself. Goodbye, Rather. Maybe I ran too slowly, but you didn't die fast enough. Boo! Villains that commit suicide, just because their plans for world domination didn't work out. I have no sympathy for that. Coward. Well... I'd like to announce the case solved. Everyone is dead. We're going home. [sinister sounds] [quiet laughter] [quiet rattling] [evil laughter] You are so stupid! The scorpion ring was from a gumball machine. Damnit! I always fall for that trick. Good riddance. [intense music] [pounding sounds] [screams] That's all you've got? [Pennymarket] Even! [romantic orchestral music[ Even. You have saved my life. Thank you. Yes, danger is my... I mean... I am... I have to... You have asked me whether I have a boyfriend. Yes, I have one. [Music stops] A really nice one actually. Unfortunately, we always had to hide our relationship at work. Alfons and I are engaged. You're happy for me, right? Come with me, my dear. I have big plans. Thanks again for saving my life and all that. Byebye. Boy, oh, boy. That was quite a thing. This wild, futile violence, well... Like the old days, when exotic fruit came to shops in the GDR. I like you, young man. Have you ever considered a career in the police force? Well, I used to be something like a police officer. Well, most of us were doing that. More or less. I think we should talk about it in a more relaxed setting. Well... That's what it's like, being one of the good guys. In the end, you're always alone. Don't you forget, Chief Inspector, we still have each other. But I don't even like you. "I can't" lives on I-Don't-Want-to-Road. What? You know, Sir, this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. And the end of my damn guilty conscience. The death of Rather Short was not my fault. Correct. Although, now it kind of is. Just shut your damn mouth. Of course, Sir. With pleasure. Silence has its own flair. You don't always have to talk. Mind if I give you a hug? [Longer] No way. [Long] It was just an idea. [Gunshots] [rhythmical dance music] [Song: "The Wizard" by Anke Engelke and Right Said Fred] [laughs] My apologies, that's the national anthem now. By the way, Inspector Long won last year's yo-yo derby. [Song continues] Because you were too stupid again, afterwards... won last year's... billiard derby. he wasn't someone alive, but someone did? -dead... -did. I'll turn around and go back to... Oh shit! I wanted to go to Madame Tussaud, to the wax figure of Erich Honecker. [everyone laughs] [Song continues] need in your current state of bind... [Man] Cut. I'll take Dubinsky to a safe place and stay with him. [laughs] I'll take Dubinsky to a safe place and stay with him. I'll take Dubinsky to a safe place and stay with him. -I want a new lighter. -Cut! Maybe... he has... Maybe I have fucked up. Apologies. I'm just not happy with our overall situation. Pst! Wrong movie. [Laughter] [Laughter] [Laughter] [Song fades] [everyone yells] [grunts] -Want ride? -Yes. Hahaha. Ah...Seat belt. Hahaha.
