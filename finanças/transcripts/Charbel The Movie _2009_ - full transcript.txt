May he rest in peace, Father Superior. May he rest in peace, Father Superior. May he rest in peace, Father Superior. May he rest in peace, Father Superior. May he rest in peace, Father Superior. May he rest in peace, Father Superior. May he rest in peace, Father Superior. Father Superior, Father Superior! Light, light, light! What's the matter brother Boutros? Father, a light, a light shines from F. Charbel's face at the church! It seems you fell asleep in the Church and dreamt. Go and ring the bell for the midnight's Mass. Look, this is the skull of F. Elias. Is this how we are going to become, F. Ephram? There is no other way to heaven. Blessed be F. Charbel! He knew how to live and die. You are right Bou Mikhael. The dead of this hermit is like his life. He knew what one takes with him. One might live about 70 or 80 years living his life to the full. And forgets how he is going to end up: a handful of soil and some bones. Help me putting these 2 pieces of wood as a mattress for F. Charbel. It would be better than laying him on the mud. A mattress or two pieces of wood ? ! It does not matter. All his live, he slept on the ground and his pillow was just a piece of wood. The one who used to die each day for this world would he be afraid to sleep on this mattress? And this water leaking from the ceiling. And coming out from the walls? We asked if we could put him in a coffin and burry him in a dry place. They replied that "this does not comply with the rules" - He should be treated like the others. - He should be treated like the others. Did you see it? Welcome, what's going on? What's happening, Georges? Father, last night was like the other nights. We saw a light shining from F. Charbel's tomb! I saw the light as well. I saw it many times by my own eyes. Our house is opposite the monastery anyone could see the light. What you're telling could be true. But to be frank with you, I won't believe it unless I personally see it. I myself have to see it. When you'll see it tonight errr... give me sign. Let's say a gunshot. And I will come with you to see it. All right! The sign will be a gunshot. We are security officers. We're looking for an offender and we are sure that he's here. Ahmad Hamady, director of the region. - Have a seat. - We're looking for the criminal. From a distance, we saw a light near the monastery. We came, when we reached the place, it disappeared. How would you explain this? We would like to know. This light, everyone sees it it's really weird! According to our monastery's rules. All lights must be turned off at 9 p.m. and it's already midnight. I have no idea about the light you're talking about. - It's the criminal! - No. There is no doubt, Charbel is a Saint! - Glory be to God! - Which monk is buried here? Open the tomb! Why are you keeping him under the ground? I'm sorry Mr. director. We can't open the tomb unless by the Patriarch permission. The Patriarch? Very well, he's our friend. Tomorrow morning, I'll go to Bkerky to explain to him what I saw. Allow me, your Excellency. You know, people are obsessing about this. They insist on opening the tomb and taking the rests of F. Charbel. We present to you our notice to take the adequate procedures. The General Abbot presented to us the issue. And we are taking it into consideration. The light on the tomb must be explained. Your Excellency, I myself saw the light on the tomb. I'm not saying that to advertise. He has been in the tomb for 4 months we must take him out, lay him in a coffin and put him in a hidden place. I mandate F. Eghnatios, the Superior of the monastery, to open the tomb. The tomb was opened. The body of Charbel was sound and secreting water and blood. Then the miraculous phase of the body started. First, he was put in a special coffin and then he has been taken out from it several times. And at each time, the hermit's body secreted water and blood soaking thus the sacerdotal vestment and the pillows. When the tomb was opened in 1950 a half century after Charbel's decease thousands of believers streamed over Annaya's monastery. And they were all full of piety fervour and faith. in the holiness of the monk buried there. In the presence of a special committee of priests and doctors the body was taken out from the metal coffin damaged by rust. It was fresh and sound except for the miraculous water and blood. The body was then washed and dressed with sacerdotal vestments as if he was dead a week ago. The body was lied in state and the crowds rushed to get the blessing and to kiss the hand of Annaya's saint. The wife of the President of the Republic headed them. This holiness has appeared through many miracles the most important of which were the healing of Sister Mary Abel and that of Alexander Obeid, so they were kept in the beatification file in Rome. The government was also interested in this event. Thus, it send its delegates to investigate. They saw with their own eyes the miracles and they witnessed to Charbel's holiness. Would you, Minister, add on to your signature: Finance Minister and Deputy of Mount Lebanon? Father, in front of the majesty of Charbel all other majesties prostate. And what I've just written is enough. Can you tell me Father, what is the biggest Miracle that Father Charbel ever did? The biggest Miracle is his life! Charbel was born in 1828. The same year in which the monastery was built. No, Joseph! You cannot climb! You will fall! No my son. O Holy Virgin what a boy! Hurry up Antoine it's time for dinner, come on kids. In the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. Antoine Makhluf? Upon the governor's request, you're subject to forced labour with your donkey starting tomorrow to pass on munitions and food to the army from Mejdlaya to Beiteddine. Officer, from whom will I leave my family? We are poor. These poor children have no one but me. This is none of our concern. Give me 2 days so I can provide the needs of my children. It is an order! Tomorrow morning, or else... My brother, take care of my children. You'll take my place in my absence. I'm going in peace for I count on you. Gherfine, Gherfine, he died in Gherfine, where is Gherfine? It's a village near Amchit. He died indignantly on the road. Because of our poverty, we could not bring him and bury him in the village. They buried him there. We didn't know neither how nor where. Before he left, he entrusted me with his house and family. Wardeh and John are already adults and can take care of themselves. But, this little Joseph... Joseph, Joseph! Come here. Go to the Church. Your uncle the priest should be waiting for you, it's time for prayer. Tanios, why are you worried so much? Your sister-in-law got married. And her husband became the priest of the village. He now takes care of the children and can lift the burden from your shoulders. Joseph. It's time for the procession of the Icon go and start the preparations. You tender Mother of God, Treasure of Mercy and help, You are our shelter and Hope. Intercede for us Holy Virgin And have mercy on our dead. Good, sit down. Quiet, children! You too, not a word! Joseph, go ahead. Blessed be the man who provides for the needs of his family. God, sit down. Do not forget kids, tomorrow is the Transfiguration Day. I want to see you all at church, understood? Put your things away and go to play. Look and this smoke! Is this a fire? Bless me Father. Give me some water, Bou Karam. - I'm out of cigarettes, can I have one? - Of course you can. You'll have two instead of one. Tell me, this child sitting on the rock isn't your relative Joseph? Yes, he is. Since his childhood, we find him either on the rock or in the grotto. Why does he go there, father? The story of the rock and the grotto is long, Bou Karam. He turned 13 on the Feast of Our Lady. Since then, his visits to his hermit uncles to the rock and to the grotto keep going on. Such is his life. What will be the future of this boy? Only God knows. Tell me, is there any news about the Ottoman soldiers? They say that a troop came to Bcharry and took 7 or 8 persons and it's the same situation in the neighbouring villages. They ruined us! We wait the harvest impatiently. And then, they come like locusts and eat everything. What can we do? It's out of our hands. But, one day, this holy mountain will wake up and it will shake up the whole world. Gazelle! You still stay calm. Take a rest. and behave well! I'm going to pray.. I have a very good idea but I'm not going to tell it to You. First, I will ask my uncles at the hermitage of Kozhaya for advice. My nephew, do you know what it is said about us, the hermits? Crazy. But the words of St. Paul are as sharp as the sword. "What is the considered insane by people is however seen wise by God". Let's keep the Judgment of people aside. Only God is our lot. Everything is ephemeral. Life is ephemeral. Beauty is ephemeral. Pleasure is ephemeral. Only God is the Eternal happiness of man. The wise man is the one who doesn't find his lantern empty at the time of death. Prayer, meditation, I agree. But God said, "act so I can help you" We must work hard in order to live and pay taxes. Stop your illusions.! Can you tell me why are you weird lately? It seems that during your visit to your uncles they impressed you to join the monastery. I'm telling you now, this issue is out of the question, forget it! We asked for the hand of Mariam daughter of Manneh, in marriage for you. It is time, what are you waiting for? Look at Simon, he is your age and he is getting married today. We'll go and congratulate them this evening. Your mother and your uncle are waiting for us at home. Finish removing the leaves of this blackberry and follow me. God is the love of my life. I should have no fear. What's the matter, Mariam? I can see you are worried and anxious. He always runs away from me. Distracted and always absent. I can see him just for a while on Sunday at Church. What have I done to him? As if he is not my cousin. You know how he lives. The closest to his heart are the Church and the field and we need him to give us a hand. - What shall we do without him? - You are right. He is so strong, he is devoted to work and he is extremely handsome. Look at you! I can see your eyes shining. Do you have something you want to tell me about it daughter? Tell me. - Are you still baking bread? - We finished. We still have two loaves. Virgin Mary! Where did this goat go? Leave everything and follow me! - Praise be to God. - Always to God. Where do you come from, young man? From Bka'kafra. My name is Joseph Makhluf. Is it possible that I see the Superior of the monastery? Certainly, come with me. Did you come here to become a monk? It's my aim, master, if God wills. You said you come from Bka'kafra. - It's a village facing Bcharry. - Facing Bcharry and the Cedars. It's a village which gives good monks. - Hope you'll be pious like them. - Hope so, master. Go help this monk to put the cows in the byre. Young man, young man. Give me a hand please. May God bless you! 912 years before Jesus' coming, Eli, is an Hebrew word which means "The Lord"!!! May his prayer be with us, amen and bless us, father. Joseph Makhluf. Son, what are you asking from our order? I come to ask the help of God and Salvation for my Soul. Son, the monastic life is so hard. It requires from you to work stay awake and bear the Cross. Can you put up with all this? By the help of God and your entreaties, I'm ready, Father. Seeing that you're ready, courage, son! May God be with you! Who is brother Charbel? They're waiting for you at the gate. Father, we, poor farmers, can't do without the help of a young man like Charbel. We need to work hard, we want to live. Does God force a man to leave his family against their will? His parents who sacrificed themselves in order to raise him. Joseph knows very well that his mother can't do without his help. All what you're interested in, you the monks, is to reach your target. Here you are, the saint! Do you you thing that you love God by making your parents dissatisfied with you? You know what is your duty, your duty is to be with your mom so that she survives. We are already old. Do you want us to take a bag and go begging? Take off the black and come with me! Brother Charbel is not a child. He is aware of what he's coming to do here. His father died when he was 3 years old. I suffered a lot in order to raise him. Now that he became a young man and give me a hand. He leaves me in my old age without even saying, "goodbye mom"? We proposed to him a very good girl, Mariam. Since he left us, she didn't stop crying. Mom, uncle, I love you so much. I know very well how much you suffered. But, since God wants me for him only. You can't... you can't refuse no more. What will you benefit from your Order? The monk of the monastery depends on the monastery. If you won't be a good monk you'd better come with me. I know, God wants you to serve Him alone. I tell you from the bottom of my heart. "May God be with you, son! May He Bless you and protect you and make you a Saint!" Look, this is the monastery of St. Maron in Annaya. Do you see this high mountain? On the top, stands a hermitage. The hermitage of St. Peter and St. Paul. You'll spend the 2nd year of Novitiate at this monastery. You will like the field and you won't see anyone. - Praise be to God! - Always to God. - Praise be to God! - Always to God. Praise be to God! Praise be to God! - Praise be to God! - Always to God. You, Bread of Life. And Food of spirits. Did you see how F. Charbel is passionate about the theory? And he is still so as usual. He is pretentious and hypocrite he wants to show off! Brother Abraham! This is the last warning! This isn't the first time you disobey the rules and judge people unfairly. Go on, all of you to plant onion. - Tell me, how old are you Brother Charbel? - Forgive in the name of Jesus. You are 23 years old and you do not know that we plant the onion upside down? Stupid! You'll never be able to do anything in the Order. That if you ever become a monk. Do you all think, brothers consciously and honestly. That brother Charbel and brother Rukoz deserve that the Order accepts their Vows? Answer the question by secret voting. Wheat means accepted. Barley means rejected. I, brother Charbel, promise and vow before God the almighty and the blessed ever Virgin Mary and our Father St. Antoine to keep obedience, chastity and voluntary poverty until death in accordance with our laws and rules. - Praise be to God! - Always to God. I'm the mother of brother Charbel. I came from Bka'kafra to congratulate him for wearing the cowl. - Can't we enter the monastery? - It's forbidden according to the rules. Would you come in to the reception room and we'll talk to the Father Superior. Brother Charbel the Father Superior is asking for you. Your mother and your relatives want to see you. I allow you to see them in the reception room. My brother and my relatives? Who are my mother and my relatives? It's true my son that the rules are firm but the cicumstances are exceptional. I do not order you, but I give you the permission to see them. Thank you, father. Is that so? You will not let me see you! I came on foot from Bka'kafra to see you! In Heaven, in Heaven we will see each other. And we will be together forever. I envy him. He became a monk and he is relieved of the Novitiate difficulties. How is it so? This one forgets his comfort and looks for his duties. He feels more proud in wearing this old habit instead of wearing the new one. Didn't you see his mother? His mother! Is there anyone dearer than the mother is? And he didn't want to see her. You are right, what a meeting! He said two words from inside the church they did not even see each other! He gave her a meeting in Heaven, brother. He sees everything in this World beyond Immortality. What did Jesus himself say when His mother came to see Him? "Whoever does the will of my Father in Heaven is my brother and sister and mother". It is not harshness, brother it is not hard-heartedness. It is courage and sacrifice. It is obedience to the rules. Come in. Sit down, my brother. My son, your time as a novice is over. The General Abbot named you student to devote yourself for the Sacerdotal studies. Tomorrow morning you will go to Kfifan's monastery. You will be accompanied by... brother Paul. This if F. Nehmatallah Hardiny known as "The Saint of Kfifan". Poor one! He thinks that the Novitiate is over and that he comes to rest here. He doesn't know that another Novitiate is waiting for him with us! Praise be to God, master. Welcome my brothers. - Where do you come from? - From Annaya, master. Annaya? How is the Community there? - Are they all fine? - Yes, they are master. Everyone kisses your hand and your hermit brother is fine also. Thank God. The Novitiate is the most beautiful period in the monastic life. During the Novitiate One forgets the whole world and attaches himself to God. Well brother Charbel, now go to work. Follow your brothers and help them in the tobacco's cultivation. And you brother Paul, after having your breakfast and resting for a while and when you go back to Annaya send our regards to the monastery's monks. Look, what a theological school! It seems that it is purely a cultivation school. Everything is good by obedience, my brother. - Praise be to God, master. - Always to God, brother. What do you think about the theology course, brother? Master, I am a farmer By God's grace and your prayer, I am willing to do my best. My son, the priest is a second Christ. And the one who wants to become a priest, he only has one way to follow: The way of Golgotha. The Blessed Sacrament, yes yes, I think that I've understood. Come quickly, F. Nehmatallah had an attack! - Healer of the sick. - Pray for him. - Refuge of sinners. - Pray for him. - Help of Christians - Pray for him. - Comforter of miserable people. - Pray for him. - Queen of angels - Pray for him. I anoint you in the name of the Father and the Son. And the Holy Spirit, amen. Master F. Nehmatallah the brothers here ask for you blessing. My brother, the wise man is the one who knows how to save his soul. It is good to confess to God. And to venerate Your name You the Sovereign And to declare Your mercy. Look, this is F. Rukoz coming back from the spiritual retreal we were just mentioning you. What news are you bringing? Praise be to God, brother. - May God reward you. - Always to God. "I am the Lord's servant may it be to me as you have said" F. Charbel, F. Charbel! Come quickly, my son is dying hurry up to help him. Help me! Mom is still absent. I'm here son. I went to bring you this monk. To pray so you'll get healed it's him the saint. A monk? Take him away! I don't want any monk! Let me die my way. Where is the ache, son? If I can help you, I'm ready. I feel, a fire in my chest. My mouth burns from thirst! I feel pain all over my body as if I've been beaten with a thousand bludgeons as if I've been crushed with a mortar. Be strong my son! The fire of pain purifies our soul. God is a tender father he loved us more than the whole world. And our penitence pleases him if He wants you to be with Him. Then what are you afraid of? God loves you more than your mother does. You hace a mother in heaven who open her heart for you. Tell her with me, You refuge of sinners, intercede for me You refuge of sinners, intercede for me. Rest. Who is interested in you? Why is all this effort?! Take advantage of your life. You are still young. Enjoy the pleasures of this world! Eat... drink... be happy! Everyone makes fun of you. And you are better than them. You are a saint Charbel! If you want, you can become rich and lead a luxurious life. You can become the Superios of this monastery. Wake up and get rid of this burden. Your life is passing in vain. It does not benefit anyone. You are a poor man. You will end up dead. Damnation... Damnation... Damnation... This evening, we're holding a monastic chapter. There 2 reasons for this meeting: sharing the harvest between partners and the breah of F. Ephram. Let's deal first with F. Ephram's case go ahead F. Ephram. Brother Mathew, would you read the article concerning the visit rules? "the monk must, while traveling, ride only a donkey and take with him a companion!" "when he goes out of the monastery" Brother Ephram. Where were you going alone yesterday at sunset and riding a horse? The one who respects the rules the rules respect him as well. You punishment is... to kneel during meals having only water and salt, for a week. Master, Father Superior forgive him in the name of the Christ. I sent him to make a tour in the fields and there were no one to accompany him. May God forgive you, stand up. About Father Charbel, can you ask the General Abbot the permission for him to become a hermit. Master, he has been asking for this for a long time. I'm against encouraging this, we need F. Charbel for the mission more than for the hermitage. I beg you master to convince him against this idea. This issue of F. Charbel's moving to the hermitage is out of question now. The meeting is over. - Praise be to God. - Always to God. Hurry up Abdo. There is not a drop of oil in the lamp. The Father Superior has ordered the monks not to light their lamps. Please, fill my lamp up with oil. Praise be to God. Oil in the lamp? Fine, put it here. I will fill up and take it to your room. Well! Charbel brings his lamp with him. Is he disobeying the orders of the Father Superior? No. F. Charbel was absent when the Superior gave the warning. How did you tell him that you'll fill up his lamp? Don't you know that here is no oil? No oil? Do not worry Saba? I have the best quality of oil. No, no what are you doing? - You're pouring water? - Yes, I am so that F. Charbel learns a lesson who told him to come late to the dinner and not to know what the Superior said? - Here it is master, your lamp is filled up - May God reward you, Abdo. Stay with me to see what he will do. Look! The lamp of F. Charbel is lit! It's impossible! Maybe he has another lamp, can water be lit?! Lower your voice! The monks will hear us. F. Charbel has no other lamp. What is going on? What are you doing here at this time? I'm afraid of telling you Father Superior. I filled up the lamp of F. Charbel with water instead of oil. And look, it's lit! Water? Are you playing with F. Charbel? Are you his age to joke with him? Go to bed, we'll see tomorrow. I'm surprised F. Charbel. This is the first time you disobey an order. Why is your lamp lit? Forgive me in the name of the Christ, Father. Stand up my brother Charbel. Forgive me and pray for me and bless me brother. God, I came to You. Here in the field you can hear me better. I come to Golgotha to share with you your suffering for the rest of my life. My weakness is scaring me. But Your grace is my weapon. With You, the hermitage is for me bigger than a palace. And I can see the fiels getting wider and blossoming. And the light of Your face the aim of my life, shining. Lord, everything is ephemeral in this world except Your charity. - Praise be to God, brother. - Always to God. Welcome my Father hermit. Come with me to show you your room. The tools of the hermitage, I counted them one by one after the death of F. Lichah. The Father Superior told me to hand them to you as I received them. Here is your room, master. And this is F. Makarios. And this is the one where the tools are kept and here are the vineyards. It's the harvest time and we're waiting for you to help us. May God reward you my brother. The hermit does not isolate himself to get away from the monastic rules and from loving the others but in order to improve oneself through mortification and the virtues And this is in silence and suppressing the heart The hermit must respect everyone. He is forbidden from talking unless it is necessary. The word hermit should suit him well. He is a person who choses the loneliness and oppresses his feelings and throughts. He doesn't eat with anyone in his room. He eats once a day one kind of food and absolutely without meat and he does not eat fruits nor have dessert. He does not drink alcohol and never leaves the hermitage unless according to a written permission from the Father Superior. It is sbsolutely forbidden for women to enter the hermitage. In addition to his life of meditation, the hermit must practice manual labour at the hermitage and in the field. - Praise to be to God, master. - Always to God, son. Here are a Mass fee. Give them to F. Makarios, son. The once who gave them to me wants you to take them and to personally celebrate the Mass. Take this money, my brother. Do you think that he will go on eating the stalks of purslane and the burnt bread? Poor him! He has a poor health. The food is in front of him. It has been 5 years, don't you know by now that it's his habit? That is how he likes to eat he is happy and despise his health. Who is it? I'm the brother of the hermit Charbel from Bka'kafra. Wait until I see if the hermit is here. My brother is at the door, can I open to him, please? Or course, of course master. You are asking me for permission and you are the hermit! - How are you brother? - I'm fine thank God. Do your family and you practice your religious duties? Excuse me brother, I have a meeting. It has been 10 years since he's at the hermitage. Will he change his habits? - Who does he have a meeting with? - He always has a meeting. With whom? With the once who said: "Anyone who loves a father, a mother" "a brother or a sister more than he loves me, is not worthy of me". Do you know now with whom? Your brother is a man totally taken by God. He lives out of this world. I know very well master. He hasn't changed since his childhood we used to lose him And find him in the grotto praying. Look F. Charbel! What did you watch over last night? The foxes ruined us! They were hungry, I let them eat some grapes. Alright my brother. Let us go and help them in the wine press. Go to the hermitage and give his order to F. Charbel: to bless the water and sprinkle it around the monastery. The locusts didn't leave anything in the country and they are about to get here. And if he is very ill you take the holy water and sprinkle it yourself. Look! Poor one! He had an attack once again. Are you suffering a lot F. Charbel? - Take a rest. - It's alright brother, we have to plough these two furrows. We only see you three times a year: during the big feasts. What can we do? These are the rules. You are right brother, I miss you a lot. You've been at the hermitage for 20 years, haven't you? How time flies fast! Someone is asking for you. I have a permission from the Superior for you to accompany me. Dear God! The poor! The son of the "bey" (a lord) is dying. - They brought him a priest. - Najib is their only son. He's got typhoid no doctor could help him. Look at this monk how he's huddled he's afraid that we eat him. He is afraid of seeing us and being tempted. They said he is a Saint, this is why the "Lady" sent after him. Mom, I'm hungry, I want to eat. By the power if God your son is healed. Father Charbel healed the bey's son! You brought me to this Golgotha, I thank You. I have no regrets But the people who are my brothers, and for whom you have redeemed by shedding your blood Are drowning in the tears of suffering. Don't forget Charbel that you're a hermit. Don't forget that your vocation is the loneliness and deprivation even from the joy of preaching the Gospel. Hermit? I know very well that I'm a hermit But what holds me from sharing with others their suffering? Aren't You who said once, "Comfort the miserable, visit the prisoner?" Charbel, Charbel! I'm still suffering on Golgotha until the end of the world. I need disciples to save the world through silence. Get on your knees and stretch your arms as Moses did on the mountain. Your vocation is to save with me the people throught silence through praying on the mountain. Love me and leave the rest for me and not for you. My Lord, I love you. On my sinful hands, I present to You the tears of those who suffer on earth the joy of those who are happy in this world and in heaven. Father the hermit, Father the hermit! We need you. He is a crazy man from Ehmej, please bless him. Enter the church my son. Get on your knees and fold your arms Go in peace son, may God protect you! The essential of the Gospel's content Is the Offering of Christ's love This Offering remains and is renewed during the Mass. The Mass is nothing but an effective participation in the Jesus Christ redemptive work Which is renewed anywhere and anytime. Let us pray. Your Father of Justice Here is Your Son an Offering that pleases you. Accept the one who died for me and forgive me. This Blessed Sacrament, accept it from my hands, and be pleased with me. Many are my sins But Your mercy is enormous! if You weight, You kindness abounds like mountains, look at the sins and grant Your forgiveness For the forgiveness and the Offering are much more important than the trespasses because of my sins, Your beloved Son suffered from the nails and the javelin. His sufferings are enough to please You as well as the whole world. Leave the chalice! Give me the Blessed Sacrament! Master, do you want some soup with butter, it's good for you. It is Christmas Eve May the Child Jesus heal you master Our Father Who art in heaven Hallowed be Thy name Thy Kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Hail Mary, in Your hands I entrust my soul. The poor! He died on Christmas Eve and the snow is piled up. How are we going to bury him tomorrow in this bad weather? And the Superior is absent. He went to the the funerals of the Patriarch Hanna el-Haji. Who cares about this poor hermit? Go and warm up a little. It's freezing cold! What a cold! This night, we couldn't stay at church because of the cold. How did he spend 23 years on is knees as a statue. without warming up or wearing some woolen clothes! Blessed is he! He was warming himself up with the fire of God's love. Now he has rested. Every single moment of joy with God is worth a thousand years of pain!
