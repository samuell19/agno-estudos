To have a home of his own, he dug up a heap of fine clay from the brook bank. He made adobes out of it and he built himself a cottage as best he could. When his fellow miners saw it, they too set to work. One by one, cottages mushroomed up, until a miners' settlement grew here and it was named Godblessing. They grew all sons of herbs in their small gardens. And even if the miners were earning a hard livelihood, they lived a happy life in Godblessing. Deep down under the village, in a thousand metre thick rock intergrown with silver veins one could hear knocking hammers and clanging augers. The miners were drilling into the rock, mining silver ore from the rock. The Grim Reaper, that old grin-jaw, breathed on my neck once. I looked back to see who was breathing on my ear just when the powder went off and burned my beard. Damned misery. It's the third auger today. Don't swear, heathen, Saint Barbara doesn't like it. I will. To hell with it and that Saint Barbara of yours! How am I to feed those eleven hungry kids of mine! Just now before the village wake! Two rams and four ewes, and with them one pig. The village wake is coming, come, children, let's feast. I don't want to play any more, I'm hungry. - So am I. I'll get some bread. - Me too! Give me a little piece of bread, Mum. - Just a little one, Mummy. I haven't got any bread, children. Bread got angry at us, you see? And it left our cottage. Wait till Kuba returns from the barley shop. He'll bring flour and I'll make enough griddlecakes for everyone. Kuba is coming! - Hurrah! Kuba is coming! The millwheel's turning round and round He's coming! Kuba is coming! We'll have griddlecakes! We'll have griddlecakes! We'll have griddlecakes! Stones? Did the barley dealer give this to you? - He did. He said he could only give ash on credit to mining rabble like us. That flour was for money. One gulden twenty for Mikes, one gulden sixty for Maranek, one gulden eighty for Skalsky. You didn't work hard enough, Jacob. You used to be a better miner. It's hard work, master. The vein is weak and the rock is hard. My augers are breaking as if made of pumpernickel. What will I give the children for dinner! The barley dealer sent us ash instead of flour. Why don't you get some grains and I'll make porridge for the children. Hey, maltsters, sells us some grains! We can't! Only when Master Pandrhola tells us to. Come here! I'm from the Oubenice inn, master. The crop was small and the farmers are drinking whey at home. Next! I'm from the Jablonec inn. There's mouth disease in our village and my inn is empty. Next! - I'm from the Narysov inn, master. There was a brawl at the inn during the village fair and some strangers fled without paying. Next! - I'm from the Dubenec inn. Next. - Miner's inn at Godblessing. The miners like to chalk their pints up. Outwith you! He's coming. Cast your folds so that we catch his eye. Sell us a little of your grains, master. Be so kind and sell us a little. Out of my courtyard, mining rabble! Be off! Catch me doing that! I'd never give your goodies to that trash, now would I? Good day, master. You almost scared the wits out of me! How dare you come here, you ragamuffin! I come to beg for a little of your grains, master. What do you need grains for? To feed your pig, eh? No, I need it to make porridge for my eleven children. Eleven children? You ought to be ashamed of yourself! You're their father and I'm to feed them, eh? You ribald! Go while the going is good! Do you see that crow? It's heading to Godblessing again. Where else should it be heading? It won't go to the rich. Crow, crow, where are you taking the children? Where? To us! God speed. - God speed. Jacob! - What is it? You're a strong man, come and help me turn Matthew in his bed. Of course I will, I will always help a friend. God speed. God speed, old friend. I just called to see how you are doing. We have to turn you so I asked Jacob to help me. Poor woman! You ought to run away and leave me here to die. - You've got a bee in your bonnet again. Take some bread, it's fresh from the farmer. This is no life for you! I was buried alive a week after our wedding and I've been lying - Hush,you fool. Like a poor wretch. - Stop that godless talk! God bless! It smells like gingerbread. I must save it for the kids. - Take some more with you. We wouldn't eat it all anyway. I'll pay you back, Mary. When I have some, I'll make you happy too. I've got no cheese or bread, the cat took it all and away it went! I've got no cheese or bread, the cat took it all and away it went! Daddy! - Daddy! Daddy! Give me a piece, Daddy! Don't be hasty, you'll all get some. Kuba! - I'm here. - Give a piece to everybody. Didn't the crow fly here today? - It did. It came to our house. I thought so. God bless, you've got another girl. God speed. - She gave us a hard time. I guess you'll pay me when pigs fly. You see twelfth child is born, Jacob. Come, come. We're not so badly off, dear. Here, eat some bread, dear. I've given some to the children. We can't even have the poor baby christened. Who would want to be his godfather? - Why Every fellow miner! We miners always stick together. You stick together and you're all poor as a church mouse. If they wanted to give something to the baby they'd have to take it from their own children. Well see about that! I'll find us a godfather. God speed, gaffer. - God speed. Well What brings you here? Our twelfth child is born and all the folks are so poor that I can't find a godfather. I could be its godfather. Forgive me for being so daring, but who are you? You'd never guess, Jacob. If you would like to know who you will bring home with you, I am God himself. Good heavens! To think that I've sent Saint Barbara to hell today! I know, she told me. It was because you broke your third auger, wasn't it? Well, it happens now and then. Are you really the Lord of Heaven? I am, Jacob, honestly. Trust me. - I don't want you to be my child's godfather. Why not? Because God is good only to the rich. He's not just to the poor. Hey, forester. What brings you here, Jacob? - I'm looking for a godfather. You've found the right one. Very well, let's go. Wait. Forgive me for being so daring, but who are you? Well I'll be damned! I will tell you. I am the Devil himself. Straight from Hell. If you're the Devil than go to hell! I don't want you to be my child's godfather. - Why not? You're afraid of me, aren't you? I'm not afraid at all. But you're just the same as the lot in heaven. If you were just at least a little, you'd have to stick your fork into the belly of that damned Pandrhola. Gaffer. - What is it? Could you relieve me of my suffering a bit? I've relieved many of their suffering. Tell me what is it that you need? I need to christen my twelfth child and I can't find a godfather for it. Well, Jacob, if it's me that you want, I'll do it. - Let's go. Forgive me for being so daring, but who are you? I'm not just anyone, Jacob. Let me show you something. Do you know now? Let me tell you then. I'm the Grim Reaper himself. If you're the Grim Reaper, you can come in. You're the only one who's just to the rich and the poor alike. God bless you. Are they all yours? - All mine. Come to me, come. How will you name your twelfth child? You're right. Let me think first. We've got Annie, Kitty, Josephine. Well Maybe Barbara? We've got Barbara, Daddy. You're right. I forgot about her. How should we name her, Kuba? - I'd like to have Vendulka. Very well, let it be Vendulka then. Not with cold water, you fool! It could be the death of her. You'll be our Vendulka. Jacob! Listen, Jacob, I didn't give anything to your child. I'm as poor as a church mouse, I've got nothing but my scythe. Why don't you become a doctor. It's the least I can give you. A doctor? I can hardly read and write. You won't need anything to heal people the way I teach you. When you see me standing at the foot of the bed, heal them as you like. But when I'm standing at the head of the bed, they are past helping. That'll be their death. And you mustn't get in my way. Jacob, blast it! You sleepyhead! Aren't you going to work? Heavens! Hey! Where is everyone? Come here! Hurry! Look! - What's up? What's up? - Jacob has gone crazy. That wicked, godless man. At least if he didn't make fun of people! What's the matter? Hellcats! You're ruining my business! I'm a doctor starting from today! Understand? Do you see that fool! He won't stop! What should I do with him? Quiet! Run, Jacob! Don't worry, I'm with you! Run! You know, friend. Damned women. It's best to run away from them. I'll try to cure you, Matthew. I'm past helping, Jacob. Wait, let me examine you first. Oh no Well, you see, it's not that bad. What should we What do we have here? Oh my, pancake dough. Don't breathe and don't you worry. Aaah, say "aaah" too. Good Lord! He's putting dough on his belly. Out of the way, I'll get in. Let me. It's cold, isn't it? Good heavens! I'm healthy. I'm healthy! Do you see them, crows? Let me get even with that horrible bed. You'll get your due! I've suffered in you for three long years. You beastly casket. - Matthew! My sweetheart! - Mary. Let go, Mary. Let me finish it. - Wait! Where will you sleep? - With you, of course. One bed is enough for us. God speed. Wait. You won't tell that old crow of mine, will you? I won't. - God speed. Promise me as a friend. You won't tell her, will you? Can I rely on you? You know me. Let's have another one. Two more, eh? Do you see that gaffer? He's getting his snoot full, while we're looking for him all over the village. Stop nattering! Do you think that since you're a doctor now you can give an old miner like me a lick with the rough side of your tongue? You may be a doctor, but you'll never make a good miner. You greenhorn! Look at him! - God speed. - God speed. Matthew, you rascal! You got away from the Grim Reaper after all! It's all Jacob's work. - Jacob? It was Saint Barbara, remember that. Hey, chalk up some drinks for us. This deserves a celebration! Chalk them up? I can't. Till tomorrow, tightwad, I'll be quacking tomorrow and I'll be rolling in money. Come tomorrow then. - Hush and pour us a drink. When you get sick because of your penny-pinching, I'll cure you. Lend us some money for a few pints. I'll earn some tomorrow when I go to work. Cheers! Cheers! Saint Barbara, a maiden so fair, helps miners earn their hard livelihood. She is their companion deep underground. Fetch us a plate of sausages and make sure they are hot. I'm afraid I can't. You've already spent your silver coin. I told you to bring it. - Who pays may order! And who orders should pay, eh? Good Lord, Matthew! It took me so long to save the money. I know, dear. You were saving for my coffin, weren't you? And we'll drink up my coffin today! One gulden twenty makes twenty sausages! A gulden thirty, two guldens fifty, that's a keg of beer. I'll tap it myself! - As you wish. Well, well! Chalking it all up, aren't you? I've got my money after all. - Hands off! The money is mine! - Yours is the beer and the sausages! The money is mine! - Pig! I'll rip you apart! I'll teach you a lesson, you mining rabble! Wait, wait, let him go. His belly will soon be flat. Wait, you silly. I love you so much. Saint Barbara, a maiden so fair, helps miners earn their hard livelihood. She is their companion deep underground. With a heavenly burner, with a heavenly burner, she enlightens their way. Barbara! God speed! Look, my pockets are full of sausages. Surprised, aren't you? Would you like a sausage? Don't be ashamed and say that you'd like one. You know what? I'll bring you one. Wait there. I'll be right there. I'll be right there. Here, take it. They're still hot. Won't you have some? Oh my! Oh my! Help! Somebody! Are you all right, gaffer? - Oh my! She threw me down. She kicked me. You'll never see me bringing you a sausage again! Is anything wrong? - My knee hurts. And I've bumped my head. Can you stand up? - I don't know. Ouch! Oh! Nothing doing. You must carry him, Matthew. Carry me. Wait. Ouch! Don't you ever trust women, friend. They're all wicked. Even Saint Barbara. Get up, Jacob. There's a crowd waiting outside. Wake up and start doctoring. We have to feed the children. Go home everybody! All sick should be in their beds! I'll call on you all to see what I can do. Come to us first, Verunka won't last till the evening. Verunka? Fie! What a horrible smell! Out with you old hags or else! Damned old hags. Let's have a look at you. What a strange illness. Since when is she sick? - Since this year's fair. And which of the lads danced with her the most? The blacksmiths son. I told her I'd break her legs. If the illness was brought about by the blacksmith, only the blacksmith can cure her. Don't you think? Which one is it? The handsome one, with the curly hair. I see. Hey you, with the curly hair, come here quick! Through the window, they might not let you in through the door. Outwith you! - Wait! Just wait. If I am to heal your daughter, you will keep your mouth shut. And you'll give her twelve kisses, understand? Stop it! Twelve kisses, but they must come from your heart to make her blush to the root of her hair. What are you staring at? Hurry up! Count them to make sure he's not cheating. Five, six, seven. I've made a mistake. - Never mind. Start all over again. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Enough! Go now, you don't want to make the blacksmith angry. I'll get a gulden for healing your daughter. Come to us, Darbujan. - Come to us first, Jacob. Don't be silly, women, I can't go to all of you at once. Come to us, dear Jacob. - Be sensible. You're coming to us first and that's that! Besides, you owe us two guldens for flour. Only two guldens? You mean the ash from yesterday was for free? Come with me! Good Lord. The pain is terrible. Ouch! What took you so long! Let's see what's wrong with you. Show me your tongue. Now your eye. And how about this? Ouch! Oh my! It's very serious. It may seem like an ordinary backache. While it's carborundum sequestrum. He might not survive till the evening. Cover me, hurry up! Did he make out his last will? Good heavens! No! Write it down, quick! I devise all my estates to my wife. Write it down! There's no need to lament, I'll get you well in no time. - Do you think so? How will you cure me? How? With dough. Matthew is running like the wind. Dough? All right. I can afford it. My health is at stake. Fetch the biggest dough trough we have and water. Not cold water. That would be the death of me. Well, and now bring a sack of your finest flour! Make sure it's yellow like daffodils! There, squat down. The pain will be gone in no time. I don't want to! I can stop if you want. For safety's sake, just put down that you devise all That you devise all to your wife Philomena. There. Any better? - A little. Hold on for a little longer. Well. You'll be as fit as a fiddle. Is it better? - A little bit. And now? It's gone. It's really gone. I'm well again, Philomena! But a sack of flour is wasted. I'm ruined! You're wrong, master, you're not ruined, you'll only pay me two ducats for curing you. I won't give you a single penny! You owe me a lot of money. You won't pay me, eh? I'd think again if I were you. You won't get a penny. Carborundum ultrasequestrum, now! Bring me two ducats. Hurry up! It will cost you four ducats now. It will cost you four ducats now. God speed. - It's so nice of you to come here. Our boy is vanishing in front of our eyes. What did our stammering doctor say? The doctor? He's just like the barley dealer. He won't come if you don't pay him. Let me have a look at him. What did you give him? All that people tell you for free. Cold and hot compresses. Wild thyme and camomile. I'll give you just the right medicine, sonny. Do you know how it's called? Sausageum duplicatum. You'll take it twice a day with bread. Here you are. Or three times will be better. Where will we get the money for such expensive medicine? Where? Here. We can't take it from you. - Take it, it's the barley dealer's money. He paid for your medicine in advance. Put a cold compress on it, you silly old fool. I'll go and get Jacob. You're not going anywhere! It's all his fault. He cursed give it to me Saint Barbara. She got us confused and she punished me instead of him. Miracles are happening, folks! Jacob is healing everybody in town! How? That's the main thing. With dough. Just like he healed Matthew. Give me the pancake dough that you've made. Hurry up! Come on! What's taking you so long. If that dimwit can do it, so can I. Daddy! - Hurry up, children, let's feast! Come here and take some. - I want some. Give me some, Daddy! It's time to feast, dear! Kill this one. Are you eating, Annie? She is eating! She's eating my pig! You rabble will eat me alive! Help! Help! He's getting worse. He is past helping. We must sum...summon a con... consultation, be... before it's too Ia... late. Here. Don't be shy. Have them play a solo and dance with her. I'll bring her myself, noodle. Hey, bandmaster, catch this! A blacksmith covered in sweat and soot is better than a footman in fancy suit. The blacksmith grabs his hammer and sets to work, while the footman's on his knees picking bones. And give her at least ten kisses or she'll be all sick again tomorrow! Vojta! Martin! Mikes! Go home, all of you! The brewer's wife orders you to fetch doctors! Pandrhola is very sick! - I'll be right there! Get the doctors! Quick! You lazy-bones! Hurry up! Vojta, you'll go to Picin! Martin is going to Oubenice! And Mikes to Narysov! Moribundus, dear colleagues. I believe it's moribundus. What did you say? - Moribundus. Oh yes, you are quite right. It must be moribundus. They say it's moribundus. Get Darbujan. What brings you here, dear? The mistress is sending you fairing from the village wake. You don't say! Pork feast sausages? From Pandrhola's wife? - Yes. Our master is very sick. Well, why don't you call the doctors to see him? I'll get a beating if I don't bring you. Look, silly, tell your mistress that Darbujan will come and see Pandrhola if sausages are growing on those pines by tomorrow morning. Understand? Yes. - Go home now. I'm going. It's just the two of us, me and my friend, we'll pay for our beer, there is no one we fear, me and my friend. Me and my friend. Punch him. Take him from behind. - They're beating somebody. Punch him and I'll stick him. They'll beat him to death. He's done. Now the last one. They must be strangers. Let's get out of here or they'll beat us too. What brings you here? Are are you the new new doctor? That's me. - I am also a doc... doctor. What can I do for you? I was wondering whe... whether you kn... know what mor... moribundus is? Moribundus? - Mo... mo... mo... moribundus. I see, moribundus! That's a terrible illness. At times even lethal. And wh... what are its symptoms? There's a number of symptoms. Stammering St... stammering? And how is it cu... cured? By all sons of ways. With money. How much? Let's say two guldens. Isn't it too too much? Let's say three guldens. - That seems fine. Come in. - Hush! Sing something. You'll wake the kids. - Pi... pi... pi... pianissimo. There, you're healthy now. Thank you, doctor. I'm so happy that I was cured of mo... mo... mo... moribundus. A miracle happened, Jacob! A true miracle. Just image that sausages are growing on the pine trees. Did you say sausages? - Golly! Sausages! Are you crazy? You can't wake people so early. - Come and see for yourself. Come children, catch them. Give me one, Daddy! Me too! There are sausages growing on our pines. - What are you saying? Come here, women! Pandrhola was feasting yesterday, and today there's a feast in Godblessing. Come and take all you need, there's plenty for everybody. The pines over there are also full of sausages. Jacob! I'm here. - God speed, gaffer. Did Saint Barbara kick you in the knee? And here too. - Let me see it. Don't touch it. - What did you put on it? What? Pancake dough. That was a mistake, you're a flesh-eater like a wolf. Dough won't do you any good. Kuba! - Yes? Pick a basket of sausages for the gaffer so that he gets well soon. Throw me a full basket of them. Some more. A lot more. Nothing doing. It seems I can't do proper miracles after all. I forgot to tell them to grow blood and barley sausages too. Don't waste time and get on! Where are we going? - My husband is very sick. Don't you know? - I was sick on Thursday myself. When Pandrhola sent his dogs on me. Shut up, you rabble. Didn't you promise yesterday that you would come? As soon as sausages grow on your pine trees! That is true, the sausages truly grew by the morning. I will go with you as soon as beer flows in our brook. To flush down the sausages. - You're crazy, Jacob! I am not crazy. I know what I'm saying. Darbujan won't go and see Pandrhola until your beer flows in our brook. He wants to ruin us, dear. He said that beer had to flow in the brook. Otherwise, he wouldn't come. You don't need him, do you? You can do without him, can't you? The pigs cost us a fortune already. Or do you think we ought to call him, dear? To pour barrels of our precious beer into the brook, just like that? So that the rabble can feast? Why cry, it's not our beer. Let the men in Godblessing have a good time for once! Hey, folks, come here, quick! A sea of beer is flowing down! Hurry! Well? When are you coming, you idler? You've eaten all the sausages, drank all the beer. Isn't it enough for you? I'm coming this time. But I'm a gentleman now, you have to send for me two pairs of oxen from your brewery. That can be done. I only hope you will indeed come! I promised to come and I will. But each of the oxen will be wearing a nice forester uniform and a hat with a feather. That's my third and last wish. Thirty-two, eighty-five, twenty-eight. As I told you! Make four forester uniforms! They must be ready by tomorrow morning! And don't waste too much cloth or you'll pay for it yourselves! - As you wish. With or without a waistcoat, madam? Let's go! Get on, Jacob! Good morning. Let's go. - Let's go! Your ragamuffin is here, Pandrhola, since you've beseeched me to come. Well, Jacob? Cure him. The thing is that Pandrhola is past helping. You rogue! Swindler! You've wheedled pigs out of us, poured beer down your throat, so it's time for you to cure him or I'll have you arrested! Very well, Pandrhola, if you eat the grains that you refused to give to my children for porridge, I'll save your life. Bring the grains! A full dish of grains and a big spoon. So that Pandrhola enjoys it just as the miners do. I need four strong men! Hurry up! That should be enough. Don't be angry at me, gaffer, I'll give the glutton back to you after some time. What do you think you're doing? What do you mean by after some time? I have orders to follow! I must get him to Hell by midnight or I'll be in trouble. By midnight? You'll have plenty of time! Come, let me show you something. I am as sound as a bell, dear. Just like in the old times. Tell them to bake smoked belly-pork for me! And sauerkraut with heaps of fat! And my trousers! Just you wait, you ragamuffin. I'll make you pay for the grains. It's hard work being a Grim Reaper. One can't have a drink. - Come on, just for once. Those up there, they don't have eyes everywhere, trust me. Wait for an hour so that I don't have to be ashamed of my quackery. We've got to hobnob. You can't say no to that, gaffer. Cheers! Have a drink, brother, have a drink the brewer is paying for your beer. Have a drink, brother, have a drink, the brewer is paying for your beer. Out, you rabble! Out of my house! Rogues! I'll put things in order here! Can you do this, gaffer? Look. Swell. Excellent. You're good, my friend. We can wait here till the evening together, can't we? If only I didn't have such responsibility. Forget about responsibility, my friend. Let's sing a song, eh? You don't know this one? - No. Which one do you know? Begin. I almost forgot that you're the Grim Reaper. Let me teach you the other one. Glo - glo - glo... Sing along. Glo - glo - glo - gloria, beer is pouring down, Glo - glo - glo - gloria, beer is pouring down. Now this follows I'll teach you, listen. When you drink enough Sing along. When you drink enough, wipe your chin, and hand the pint to your friend. And you know how it goes on. Glo - glo - glo - gloria Where are you going, Reaper? I'll give that glutton Pandrhola back to you as soon as it gets dark. Good night. Oh dear. Don't be foolish, gaffer. It's not empty yet. Take your hammers and follow me! We need to board up the biggest barrel! Come! Hurry up! Seal it! Make sure there's not a single hole left! And throw that ragamuffin to the pigs. You lazy-bones! I'll get your bones moving, rabble! Do you want the grains to mash up? Hurry up, rogues! I see the master is in good health. Did you sleep off your fuddle? Get out of here, ragamuffin! You owe me for curing you. Be off, scapegallows! You've cost me enough! The Grim Reaper will find you! He won't! I've put him away, you fool! God speed. - Good Lord! You're a sight! Did you sleep with the pigs or what? I promise you and you too that I'll never drink again as long as I live. Could you make chicken soup for me, dear? To get back into good shape. Good heavens! Jacob! Come and have a look! Terrible things are happening! What's going on? Look! I must be out of my mind. It's the third time today. It seems the Grim Reaper has vanished. I have nothing! Nothing at all! Cheater! - He's keeping everything to himself! Let's smash his shop to pieces! Let me do it! Such a misery! One can't even hang himself. Potatoes! Lousy potatoes again! Nothing but potatoes all week! I want meat! Be sensible, dear! - Meat! You know that nobody in town has meat. But I want meat! I've got to have meat! I'll turn the tables on you! Roll out the barrel into the yard! Be sensible, dear, don't let him out! You'd better stick to potatoes! Don't be silly! What could he do to me now? I'm as sound as a bell. Break the lid! The pig can wait, I'll take you first, Pandrhola! What's that? It sounds like a passing-bell. For some rich man. Do you hear that? Fields, meadows, and houses. Fields, meadows, and houses. If it were a miner, one would only hear that he's past praying for. But the Grim Reaper is It seems the Grim Reaper is walking the face of the earth again. It's not my fault. Where were you, gaffer? They sealed me in a barrel. If you didn't have so many children, I would I know, I know. They'll give me hell up there. We shouldn't have hobnobbed so much. Indeed. And that "glo glo" of yours almost killed me. I still have a bad taste in my mouth even today. Not to worry, gaffer. I'll cure you. Here. Eat it. This pickle, Jacob, is your last quacking. I promise I'll never drink again. And I'll never cure anybody again. Agreed? - Agreed. Listen, the bad taste is gone. You wouldn't have another one, would you? - Take them all. For a rainy day. And in case you feel lonely, come any time. Not to the mine, though. You ought to let us miners leave last. Grim Reaper. God speed. Goodbye, Jacob. Who were you talking to? Nobody. Shoo! Away with you! Thirteen kids would be too much! Go to Matthew and Mary! They've been waiting for you for three years! Aren't you going to the mine with us, Jacob? Of course I'm going! What would I do without you! And especially without you! God speed, Daddy! Goodbye, Daddy! The End In Lead Roles
