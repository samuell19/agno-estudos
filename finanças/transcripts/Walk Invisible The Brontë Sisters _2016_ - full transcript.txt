(chickens clucking) (horse neighs) Emily. Uh? Yeah, straight. Straight, straight ahead. Emily. Good luck. And you. Keep him wrapped up, see. PATRICK: Are all the bags on? Everything's under control, Papa. Has she heard? Yes, I've heard. Emily, Emily. You know where the gun is? Yes. We're all in, thank you. Aye, yeah. I'll send you the address as soon as we know what it is. DRIVER: Walk, yeah. Branwell doesn't know where the gun is. Does he? Not anymore. Is he still abed? Daft question. You give him no money, whatever sob stories he comes up with. All right? He won't hit you. And if he hits me, I'll hit him back, harder. CHARLOTTE: Dear Ellen, Papa and I came here on Wednesday. We saw Mr. Wilson the oculist the same day. He pronounced Papa's eyes quite ready for an operation and has fixed next Monday for the performance of it. (Patrick gasps) Think of us on that day, dear Nell. Mr. Wilson says we will have to stay here a month at least. It will be dreary. I wonder how poor Emily and Anne will get on at home with Branwell. (knock at door, bell rings) Thank you. "Not able at present to consider publication." Do you think they actually read them? Do they look like they've been read? (sighs) Who's next on the list? Chapman and Hall, 186 Strand, London. (thunder rolling, rain pounding) There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. (fire crackling) Do you think it's wrong to write about something that's very close to home? Like what? A woman. Forced to abandon her home, a good, well-off home, to protect her child... And herself... Because of a change in her husband's character when he sinks into... You know. Addictive behavior. And then forced to make her own way in the world. No, I don't think it's wrong. I'd never have invented Hindley if I hadn't been set such a fine example at home. Have you seen Branwell today? No. Have you heard him? BRANWELL: I see a corpse upon the waters lie, With eyes turned swelled and sightless to the sky, And arms outstretched to move, as wave on wave. Upbears it in its boundless billowy grave. Not time, but Ocean thins its flowing hair; Decay, not sorrow, lays its forehead bare; Its members move, but not in thankless toil, For seas are milder than this world's turmoil; Corruption robs its lip and cheeks of red, But wounded vanity grieves not the dead; And, though those members hasten to decay, No pang of suffering takes their strength away; With untormented eye, and heart, and brain, Through calm and storm, it floats across the main: Though love and joy have perished long ago, Its bosom suffers not one pang of woe. (sniffles) Though weeds and worms its cherished beauty hide, It feels not wounded vanity or pride. (sniffles, cries softly) (wind howling) Where's ye going, lad? Haworth. (horse neighs) Whoa, whoa. (driver clicks tongue): Go it. (fire crackling) (gasps) Oh, hello. Branwell! EMILY: Branwell's here! He's collapsed! He's outside! Branwell! Branwell. Branwell. (grunts) One of you go and fetch Dr. Wheelhouse. Get a cloak on! Here, let's get him inside. Branwell, hey? Come on, son, sit up. There, hey? Let's get him in the house, come on. (door opens) You know where I am. Yes, yes. (door opens) PATRICK: Thank you for coming, doctor. (door closes) There is hope. He's home, he's back with us. And with nourishment and abstinence, and prayer, and peace and quiet, we may yet hope for better things. His body has suffered the ravages of gross neglect and abuse. Self-inflicted. And I cannot in all conscience do other than blame that woman. That sinful, hateful woman. Who with her more mature years and social advantages surely should have shown better responsibility. He's come very low, but, you know, sometimes a man must sink to the bottom before he can turn his life around. And perhaps that's what's happened. What's happening, here. Where's he been? ANNE: How's he been living? Does he want to abstain? Oh, he has to. He has to abstain. Halifax, I assume... I don't know. That's where John always imagined he was. Or where John knew damn well he was. Have you talked to him? About abstention? He's asleep. It'll only work if he's determined to do it himself. Yeah. Well... (door closes) Ssshhh... (crying softly) (whispers): Anne. I should have done more. At Thorp Green. I should have stopped him, I should've told someone, I should've... I'm... complicit in their sin. No, you're not. You were in an impossible position. No, I let it happen. All I did was leave in the end. I was a coward. A moral coward before God. (people laughing) (laughter continues) (laughter continues) You all right, lad? Lydia. (gasping) (laughter continuing) EMILY: Wake up! Wake up! There's a fire! I think I've put it out. PATRICK: Branwell! Branwell! Branwell, look at me! Branwell! Delirium tremens. It's when someone who's been drinking solidly for weeks suddenly stops. Either through choice or, more usually, lack of funds. The body doesn't know how to respond, so it goes into spasm. Will it happen again? With care, no. But you do need to keep an eye on him. He's lucky. You could've been sending for the undertaker this morning, Mr. Brontë, not me. I think, rather than come back in here, he should stay in my bedroom with me. For the time being. I wrote a rhyme for you. Did you? Well, I wrote it, and I was thinking about you after I'd written it, so... It goes... Do you want to hear it? Yes. It starts, it's... The first line is... It goes... No coward soul is mine. No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere. I see Heaven's glories shine. And Faith shines equal, arming me from Fear. Take your time. Oh, God within my breast... Oh, God within my breast, Almighty, ever-present Deity, Life. That in me hast rest, As I, Undying Life, have power in Thee, Vain are the thousand creeds. That move men's hearts, Unutterably vain, Worthless as withered weeds. Or idlest froth amid the boundless main. To waken doubt in one... To waken doubt in one. Holding so fast by thy infinity, So surely anchored on the steadfast rock of Immortality. With wide-embracing love, Thy spirit animates eternal years, Pervades and broods above, Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears. Though earth and moon were gone. And suns and universes ceased to be. And Thou wert left alone, Every existence would exist in thee. There is not room for Death. Nor atom that his might could render void. Since thou art Being and Breath, And what thou art may never be destroyed. There's nothing to be frightened of. Not for someone like you. I love you. Good. I love you. PATRICK: Who? MAN: Currer, Bell. PATRICK: There's no one of that name here. MAN: No, I know that Mr. Brontë, only it's addressed to here, so I... PATRICK: That's a mystery. There's no one of that name in the entire parish, as far as I'm aware. MAN: No, well, that's why I thought happen a visitor. PATRICK: No, no. No visitors. Not at the moment. MAN: Fair enough, I'll take it back to the sorting office, then. (door closes) (footsteps) (door closes) Ah, morning, Miss Brontë. Did I hear the name? Currer Bell? Yes! Good. That's not me, obviously. But if I could take it, I could make sure it reaches him. Him. You see, he, Papa, he forgets. He's, uh, Mr. Bell, he's not here. He was here, but, but now he isn't. So I can forward it to him, I have his address. It's a funny name. Currer... I thought happen it were summat to do with Mr. Nicholls, Arthur Bell Nicholls. No, no, no, no, no, that's, it's just... That's just coincidental... Can I take it? Good... well, that saves me filling in a docket back at the sorting office, then. I'm much obliged. And so will he be. How's your... Brother? Is he... Oh, he... he's... yeah. Till tomorrow, then! Miss Brontë. Bye, bye, bye. (cow moos) (door opens) Where's Emily? Kitchen... do you want her? Letter from a publisher. (whispers): Emily! (softly): Thomas Cautley Newby... is offering to publish Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey. His terms are steep, but he's offering to publish - them, which is more than anyone else has done... What about The Professor? No. No, he's not offering to publish that. Why? So you need to think about how you want to approach this. No, that's... We should publish them all together or not at all, surely. That's sentimental. It's kind, but it's nonsense. This is a solid offer... Not a generous one, as I say, but I'll persevere in sending out The Professor. And with the other one that I've been writing. But in the meantime, you've got a choice to make. Read it. He's asking for you to provide an advance of 50 pounds towards the cost of publication. But clearly he believes it's viable, or he wouldn't make the offer. This is addressed to Currer Bell. Yes... that was interesting. You didn't... Of course not. I had to... Fib. 50 pounds. Perhaps that's normal. Perhaps whoever undertook to publish it would ask for an advance of that sort. We're a risk, we're unknown, despite the poems. Because of the poems... Two copies sold. You will persist. Oh, yes. (church bell ringing) (pounding at door) Yes? I'd like to speak to Mr. Brontë. The Reverend Brontë? Mr. Patrick Brontë. TABBY: Well, what shall I say it's to do with? MAN: Is he in? TABBY: Who wants to know? MAN: I'm a bailiff of the county, appointed by Mr. Rawson, the magistrate at Halifax. I'm here about an unpaid debt. Is Mr. Brontë in? I'll... You'll just have to give me a minute. (knocks) PATRICK: Yes? There's a man at the door, Mr. Brontë. Says he's here about an unpaid debt. Says he's been sent by a magistrate at Halifax. Now then, gentlemen, how may I help you? Mr. Patrick Brontë? Yes. I'm appointed by the magistrate at Halifax to collect a debt of 14 pounds, 10 shillings and sixpence owing to Mr. Crowther of the Commercial Inn, Northgate, Halifax, and now outstanding for a total of eight months. What's going on? Branwell, what's going on? Branwell. Shift, shift! No, Branwell, ooh! Shift! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast, little fella. Steady now. You don't want me to hurt you. And you don't want to hurt me, because if you do, there'll be bother. (grunts) I think it must be my son that you want. Your son? Right, well, where is your son, Mr. Brontë? MAN: I've got him, Mr. Riley! Emily, get him off me... I can't breathe, Emily! Stop wriggling, stop struggling, you're not going anywhere. I haven't done anything wrong... You've got the wrong man! Get off me! What were you legging it for, then? And why did you try and hit me, you little twat? It's not... Get your hands off me! RILEY: Are you Patrick Brontë? Are you Patrick Branwell Brontë? Answer the man. I have no idea who these people are. You owe money. To some publican in Halifax. And if the debt isn't paid, they'll take you to the debtors' prison. We must pay up then, eh? Take him. What? No! Papa, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, I'm sorry! Charlotte! Emily! CHARLOTTE: We have money. We have money, we have money... Please stop them. Please. Hang on, boys. Bring him back. If it's all right with you, Reverend, my colleagues'll keep hold of him until I've got the remittance. I shall require a receipt. I shall give you one. Come on. It's all right. (fire crackling) CHARLOTTE: Gentlemen, I have received your communication of the fifth instant, for which I thank you. Your objection to the want of varied interest in The Professor is, I am aware, not without grounds. I have a second narrative in three volumes now completed, to which I have endeavored to impart a more vivid interest than belongs to The Professor. I send you per rail a manuscript entitled Jane Eyre, a novel in three volumes, by Currer Bell. BRANWELL (in another room): I keep telling you. You keep being told! One day, one of us is not going to leave that room alive! I will either kill you or else kill myself. Do you want me to kill myself? Eh? Because if I do, old man, you can rest assured that you'll have driven me to it with your endless prayers and your drivel! Can you not understand, can you not get the idea that the only only respite I have from the misery of my existence is being allowed a little bit of something to drink? I'm only asking for a shilling, for God's sake! PATRICK: Just, just take it. (door opens and closes) He'll just go on and on until he gets what he wants, anyway, and I just... I don't always have the energy. Anymore. (clock ticking) (door opens) I know this is contradicting what I've said before, but my second thoughts are occasionally better than my first ones. I think you should tell Papa about Jane Eyre. About how successful it's been. Why? I think it would help him to know. That we now seem to have found a means of supporting ourselves, possibly, in the event of... Whenever something happens to him. Why Jane Eyre? No, we'll tell him about everything, but just... As a way in. But then... (whispers): He'll read it. (laughs) Now? (knocks softly) PATRICK: Yes? Papa. Huh? Have you got a moment? Yeah, quickly. I've... I've, uh... I've been writing a book. A book, and... Well, well! Would you like to read it? No, I can't. I don't have time. And you know, with your tiny little writing, I can't see it, but well done! The thing is, you see. It's published. It's been published. It's a properly published... It's a book in three volumes. Well, well! Oh! Currer Bell! No. He's famous, he's... No, that's me. That's you? What's you? That... I've published under a pseudonym. Currer Bell. You see, it's the same initials. And the thing is, it's just about to go into a second edition. It's sold a lot of copies. It's been really quite unusually successful. There's a stage play of it in rehearsal as we speak at a theater in... the Victoria Theater, in fact. In London. It's been so, um, hugely well received. (muttering) So you... You're... You're...! Yes. And... I've made money. With the prospect of making quite a lot more. And if we... If I continue to work hard, and produce the kind of writing that people are prepared to pay money for, then it should furnish us with a comfortable existence. Oh, dear. (laughs) Would you like me to read you some of the reviews? Well... (laughs) Why have you kept it such a secret? To protect ourselves. We've been accused of vulgarity and coarseness. I've forfeited my right to be called a member of the fairer sex, according to Lady Eastlake, who speculates that Currer Bell might actually be a woman. (chuckles): Well. I'm complicit in the revolutions throughout Europe. "We do not hesitate to say that the tone of mind and thought" which has overthrown authority and violated every code... Human and divine... abroad, and fostered Chartism and rebellion at home, "is that which has also written Jane Eyre." Jane Eyre. And why is it vulgar? It isn't, Papa! People are just squeamish about the truth, about real life. Our work is clever. It's truthful, it's new, it's fresh, it's vivid and subtle and forthright... But... More importantly... The point is... We didn't want Branwell to know. That's first and foremost why we've kept it a secret. It's not that he'd be scathing, we can stand that. It's because it's what he's always wanted to do. And now it looks less and less likely that he ever will. It'd be like rubbing salt into a wound. No one can ever know who we are. We've agreed. We just didn't want you to worry that we weren't... doing anything with ourselves, because we have been. We are! So who else knows, besides me? No one. I've not even told Ellen. Tabby. No one. The publishers don't even know who we are. ANNE: They think we're three men. EMILY: We'd like to keep it that way. We just wanted you to know. (sighs) Little Helen Burns, hmm? That's your little sister Maria. Maria was our big sister. Yeah. Of course she was. (sniffs) Of course she was. (sighs): Not a day that passes when I don't think about her. And little Elizabeth. And your mother. (sighs) I am very proud of you. I always have been. (church bells pealing) BRANWELL: Sunday. Dear John, I shall feel very much obliged to you if you can contrive to get me five pence worth of gin in a proper measure. Should it be speedily got, I could perhaps take it from you or Billy at the lane top, or what would be quite as well, sent out for, to you. I anxiously ask the favor because I know the good it will do me. Punctually at half past nine in the morning, you will be paid the five pence. I'll have a shilling given me then. Yours, P.B.B. (church bells pealing) (Branwell coughing) (inhaling weakly) Come on. Have you got a minute? What? We're going to have to go to London. Who is? We are. All three of us. When? Today. Why? Your... Mr. Newby... must have, I don't know, sold the first few pages of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall to an American publisher on the understanding... that it was written by Currer Bell. Well, it's obviously a misunderstanding. (stammering) No, will you... Please, see that this man is a con man! A rogue! How... How many mistakes did he print in Wuthering Heights? Proofs that you painstakingly corrected that he ignored! And now this! My publisher is livid that I could have sold my next novel to another publisher! They have first refusal on my next two novels, and now they think I'm some sort of unscrupulous double-dealer! Well, just write and explain. No. No. We have to go to London and give ocular proof that we are three separate people, the novels are not all the work of one person, and that this is absolute trash. Well, I'm not going. Why? EMILY: Because you can write a letter and explain all that, and just say that Newby's made a mistake. This is not a mistake! This is a deliberate and deceitful attempt to cash in on the success of Jane Eyre... sorry. EMILY: It isn't. CHARLOTTE: It is. Newby has made the mistake, along with a lot of other people, of assuming that we're all one person. That is all it is. Why are you so obtuse? Why are you so melodramatic? Emily. I don't want. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall promoted and sold on a deceitful cl... - misunderstanding, whichever, - that it's by anyone other than me. We have to go to London. Now. Today. And explain to Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith Williams what's happened. It's intolerable to imagine they think that I could be so slippery. But wait, look, you can't. You can't go to London and explain who you are, because they will see you. Well, that's the whole point. Yes, and you promised... You promised me that we would never reveal ourselves to anyone, ever. Well... I'm afraid because of your... Mr. Newby, we now find ourselves in a... situation. Emily, I think we should go. No... you're not going, either. No, I am. No, you're not. Newby's compromised my integrity just as much as Charlotte's. I shan't publish with him again. If you won't come with us, that's your choice. We don't need to fall out about this, Emily. It's about your novel and your name. It's got nothing to do with me. Don't be like that, Em... What's the matter? Emily. Yes, but you do know her bark's worse than her bite, don't you? (train whistles blowing) (bell tolls) Charlotte. Jane Eyre. Look. MAN: Could I help you, ladies? Yes. Yes, I'd... We'd like to speak to Mr. George Smith, please. Mr. Smith? Mr. Smith's very busy. Yes, yes. But the thing is, you see, it's... It's important. Can I tell him what it's about? Just... Just that it's a matter of importance. I'll... I'll see what... I'll see if he's got a minute. Who should I say is asking to see him? It's... That's delicate. He is a very busy man. We've been traveling for 17 hours, and we'll take up less than one minute of his time. Sir, two ladies asking to see you. What ladies? Didn't give a name, sir. What's it about? The only thing I could prise out, sir, is that it's important. To me or to them? They've asked for no more than a minute of your time. (whispers): They say they've traveled for 17 hours. Ladies, how can I help you? Am I addressing Mr. George Smith? Yes. It's a confidential matter. We're... We're here to address a misunderstanding, which, once accomplished, will be to everyone's advantage, yours as much as ours. And so we apologize for what must be an interruption to your morning's work. But perhaps if I gave you this, it would clarify who we are. Where did you get this letter? In the post. From you. You sent it to me. I am... Currer Bell. C. Brontë, that's me. And this is Acton Bell. Author of Agnes Grey, and, the point is, author of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall... not me. And Ellis couldn't come. Ellis didn't want to come... Ellis is... Anyway... The point is, we are three sisters. I have not sold the first few pages of my next novel to an American publisher, as claimed by Mr. Thomas Cautley Newby. That is not my novel, it's Acton's. I, Mr. Smith, have nothing, exactly nothing, to do with Mr. Newby. Nor will my sister, now she's seen him in his true colors. We are people of integrity, and probity. And that is why we are here. To set matters straight. Sorry, you're... You are Currer Bell? What makes you doubt it, Mr. Smith? My accent? My gender? My size? (whispers): Oh, good heavens. Oh, good Lord. Forgive me. I'm, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. We've caught you off-guard. You see, we felt it best to come and see you in person, given the tone of your letter. I wanted no room left for any further misunderstanding or doubt. Well, that's deeply, deeply appreciated, Miss, uh... BOTH: Brontë. And a great relief, of course. Have you really been traveling for 17 hours? Through the night. Such was the tone of your letter... You must be exhausted. Oddly, Mr. Smith, I feel extraordinarily awake. Where are you staying? We've booked into the Chapter Coffee House, in Paternoster Row. Our father stayed there briefly, before he went up to Cambridge. And my sister and I, my other sister, Em... Ellis, did once, before we traveled to Brussels. You've taken my breath away. Miss Brontë. Oh, you have to meet people! Have you any idea how many people want... Thackeray! Thackeray, Thackeray! Thackeray will have to meet you. Ah, Kent, Kent. (door opens): Kent! Fetch Smith Williams! You have to meet Smith Williams. He, he is such an admirer of-of-of... He was... Of your genius. He was the one that read, that read The Professor and saw instantly, before Jane Eyre... Which is glorious, by the way... He saw. He saw. He saw, Miss Brontë. The whole of literary Lon... The whole of London. Will fall over itself to spend a minute in the company of Currer Bell. Somebody really needs to do something about this Mr. Newby, though, Mr. Smith. Absolutely, indeed... It... he will be dealt with. Please, please come through to my office. Ah, Smith Williams! This... This is... Currer Bell. Oh, how perfect. How delightful. And this is Acton Bell. Ellis couldn't come. Do you like opera? (dog barking) (coughing violently) I don't... I'll see to him... I'll sit with him. (Branwell wheezing and coughing) Are you sure? You go sleep in their bed. Branwell. I'm going to be sick. (vomits and coughs) (breathing raspily) You're back! That was quick. All the way to London. How were things here? Oh, well. We've had sad work with Branwell. But other than that! Good! Good. (chickens squawking) You're the last person in the world I want to fall out with. I know. We only told Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith Williams. Well, and Newby, later. No one else, and we made it clear they hadn't to tell anyone else, either. They took us to the Royal Opera House, Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith Williams did, along with Mr. Smith's mother and his sisters, and us with nothing to wear but what we'd gone in, and they'd no idea who we were! Heaven alone knows what they must have thought about us. He's... What? Branwell. He's been vomiting blood. CHARLOTTE: Dear Ellen, I received your letter informing us of the time of your arrival in Keighley with great delight. Emily and Anne anticipate your long-delayed visit as eagerly as I do myself. We will be outside the Devonshire Arms promptly at 2:00. Wishing you a safe and comfortable journey. MAN: Anyone for Keighley? Ellen! Charlotte! Emily! Anne! Miss Nussey. Which one's your box? Is it this one? Yes, it's that one there. How was your journey? Long, tiresome. We haven't seen you for so long. I know, I've missed you. Shall we go? Yes! In the end, I realized we'd delay your visit forever if we weren't careful. And he's so quiet now. We barely see him during the day. He just sleeps. I think more people have crosses to bear than we realize. On the domestic side. On the quiet. The oddest thing. I think I told you. The Robinson girls, you know, the youngest two, Elizabeth and Mary. They started writing to Anne. About six months after their father died. I mean, they're very fond of Anne, more than she imagined. Then they wanted to visit. Here. So we let them. And they came last week. Of course, Branwell knew nothing about it. What were they like? Oh, you know. Pretty. Vacuous, non-stop yack-yack-yack. Emily popped her head in, purely to satisfy her own curiosity, of course, and then, after approximately four seconds, withdrew. One of the few occasions I've really enjoyed her surliness. Anyway, the point is they told us last week that their mother... What? Is going to marry. Sir Edward Scott. So much for contrition and guilt and madness and clauses in people's wills. He's been very sadly used, Branwell. You didn't tell him? What purpose would it serve? I'm sorry to inflict all this on you, Ellen. Charlotte. I'm your oldest friend. You can tell me anything, you know that. Look! CHARLOTTE: What is that? It's extraordinary. Three suns! (gasps) What is it? It's beautiful. It's you three. You can go now. (sniffs) You'll have to sit him up to get his shirt off. (crying softly) (crying softly) YOUNG CHARLOTTE: 'Tis a shame you're embarked on this course of myopic self-destruction! YOUNG BRANWELL: I despise everything you stand for! Revolution is in the air, and only a fool like you, sir, would ignore it! (woman talking softly) This is the infamous dining room table, at which the sisters used to sit and write. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
