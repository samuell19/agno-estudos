Is anyone in there, I carry within me. - Tan .. so soon! -Yes. - Have you been too little? - Charles? We have shown the two such a joy! I appreciate your husband. It is in an embarrassing situation, but it seems not to notice. ?Embarrassing, Your Majesty? Everyone realizes that has much to lose. And I wonder if enough strong enough to keep it. It is! Okay, ... Because people do not usually be very careful ... ... To those who do not have to be. I advise you to be vigilant ... ... The two. And the other answers: mine is bigger. Italian! Not much difference. That reassures me. It is you whom I love, much more than this. I dream of coming to get an visit at night. Only. To you and your husband. But if that bothers you, forget what I said. No, Your Majesty is welcome. -Only ... - Only what? See ... that you most often my husband to me. Leave it open the night believe convenient. We will be honored. That would spoil everything. Spoil what? The large cast honors to lose everything. Ah! Now I must leave. You can see that they are jealous. Jealousy can be destructive. Very destructive. I do bad, right? You make great strides, Your Majesty. Fight! You can Do better. I used to know how to fight at times, Majesty, but ... Know yet! Come on! Fight! Fight! Count could teach me of Verua. I have heard that is a great swordsman. Does Verua Count, Your Majesty? It shows his talent in the court, as do the other. Afraid to be better than me. By the way ... Where is ..., Verua?

In their difficult role of mediator, Who cares ... earthly welfare the faithful. Do I understand? No, Father. Countess, you must help us. A great restlessness was taken over our sovereign.

What you try to tell me? The King felt a burning passion for you. You can not think of anything else than in you. It's a passion that continues to grow, ... The more the King is drowning. The King wants to take the wife of his cousin. Your sins are forgiven, my child. The Lord's mercy is boundless. He was only interested in one thing and is related to this issue. -He has opened his heart. -Not covet thy neighbor's wife. You are absolved of your sins; my daughter. The King is suffering and I pray that accept their love. Tell the King ... Tell the King ... that try to forgive him. Lucca Alessandro Maria: I baptize you ... ...

It's horrible! - It's horrible! -It's his way of killing. He's trapped. Is it too much for you? The Countess knows nothing on falconry. -Hunting in Piedmont ... 'Death is part of the game. -Give encouragement to our lives. -The death that comes from heaven. Do not you came to our reception the other night? - Ah, yes! 'I had a migraine, your Majesty. -Not my apologies because ... -Everyone has their own migraine. I have one at this time called Spain. - Do you know Alfredo Brunelescho, our ambassador there?

I do not hiding anything. But only you're happy. Your face glows, as if the end would have out of darkness, to shine light. Do not leave me here alone. 'Let me go with you. -No. You are unjust and cruel. For God's sake! Why not believe me? Sorry. I got carried away. Two years ago, you asked my father my hand. You wanted to follow you to a country, was foreign to me. Were in love with me. You showed him night after night. I carry your name. I gave you a son. I still love you. You are who you should listen. If you no longer love me, to least protect me. I love you ... I love you. 'I owe everything. 'Alessandro, I am in danger. If you wish to enter, in! 'Thanks for the invitation. Sorry, Your Majesty.

Leave me to judge you who can. Right. You should not be afraid to touch me. Continue. Please Countess. Acompa?adnos. I turn away from it. In all, sir.

Forgive me. And seven ... And nine ... ... and Cleopatra ... ... And Pharaoh. At last we are fortunate that needed! Cleopatra remains a small, not allowed to seize it. And that is precisely what the Pharaoh want more anxiety. What, dear? Does not this makes you laugh? -If I knew how to laugh. - Do not know how are the winters here? -They are very ... - ... Primitive - Primitive. - Why are all in need to run after anything. How you would want if not, can catch them? I know someone who might be most beloved women in Turin. And the most envied. How come there is no fire in the room? We frost. His Majesty has ordered not to heating, ... The entire time that the Majesty stay at Rivoli. It's there for three weeks, abandoned to their misery. - That's ridiculous! - Why are there be given such importance? Just close your eyes and remain indifferent. Her Majesty the Queen! Ladies, I am amazed to think how you can endure as cold a few days without helaros. So you are not happy, right? His Majesty has given orders not to turn fire or serve meals at the Court, ... While he is in Rivoli. I have eaten, Countess. I, too, your Majesty. At home. What you have done? Trout came with cream. And what else? Creme brulee and pear compote.

And vigorous. - Do you have news from Madrid? -Yes. What is the purpose of travel Count? He is serving a mission the King. King relies heavily on him, because the Count is so loyal ... ... ...

Like a thief. Do not see what is happening within me. I feel ... ... As a tear. I can not understand. It's like having a beast ... wild within me, I devour ... ... ... Every time I think of you. - Do you want me to say something funny? -No. I've never had a mistress. Never! You need not have it. Beware! Maybe I'm a King, but I have the manners of a peasant. Why do you put the lamp so close to me? Well, what do we do? I go to Madrid. I say he should resign and look for something around here. What else could we do? Nobody can do that, ... Except you. I had thought to get rid of the entire royal family, Both of you .. as the others. But you would have gone ... - .. And also your perfume ... - What! - ... And your scent. - Madrid was easier! Can you imagine what have you done? She then imagine? I know. What you have so much fear? I'm here to tell you that I love and I never take it by force. Open the windows!

Much you love your husband, Is not it, Jeanne? I also love the King. -The King ... -You must help It has become more than a mere infatuation. It's a matter of state. Something that concerns the whole kingdom. The Piedmont is suffering. We can not accept it. It is impossible to accept. Jeanne, we are women. We are not important. The king himself is important. Yes, I am female. A married woman. I beg you, Jeanne. Majesty, have mercy on me! Help us please! Forgive me. Retire now. Where is it? Who has to my child? Did he have been? -The Bishop has taken. - Where it has been? Luchino! Hurry! Slip inside. Wait! You can not do anything. 'I have to speak. -Luchino. - Daughter! Toad! Toad miserable! But when will you understand? You are his. And will you not have time to care for your child. - No! -You belong to the King. Just like I belong as a priest. And your mother and your husband too. The arrogance of a family member can cause injury to all. You will stay in Turin. Your son has nothing to fear. Quite the contrary. - How can you be so mean? - I congratulate you! You must be satisfied. The whole court is in an uproar because of you. -I had never heard anything so ... provincial. The King does what ... Not a King. It's a dog obsessed. Jeanne! At last!

Do not want to forget. Please do not talk. Not now. I suppose you want to see Where are you going to be. Later, perhaps, because everything has been very rapid. Long all is prepared to your liking. I think not. -Yes, I believe. I had not come ever. Never. I know. Do you wish ...? Do you wish ... Do you wish to change you? Not necessary. - Jeanne! -Do not move, please ... ... And listen.

Return. You made me ... stay here in court. How can you? Do you? What have I done? What have I done? Nothing. Very little, eh? All my family. Your precious family. You do not help much now. - Is your idea of ??...? - What? What revenge? Is that what you mean? I would call ... revenge. Why? You thought that everything would happen behind your back, ... For your secret mission. Not wanted to find out. Close your eyes and ears. You thought you would be helpful. And it has been ... for me. 'You're a monster. - Do you? I asked the King, the King. And you said yes. - What else could I do? -It was you who accepted it. Do not want to believe ... ... Until I saw it in your eyes, when you return. I went crazy.

Never return to Torino. I love you and live where I live. Do not even love yourself. Only you know for power and possession. I am not your horse. You are my home. Ministers who come here. Will respect you more if you see less. That's what you lack respect. Exaggerate. I do not exaggerate. I have listed. You should not rely on them. Did you know that the count is Trevie understanding with the French? You get paid for it. Trevie ?? It is absurd! It's too stupid. Perhaps. These are the ministers and advisers where you can trust. The others must be replaced. Well, then replace to Trevie, as you say. A Trevie and others. You are wonderful. Anything else? At the moment, no. I've done my job for today. Have you done ...? ... My job. Why you have to say these things? It has been my duty: serve the King. 'We made love. -You did. Bitch! Bitch! What are you made of? What stone? 'You're a ... - Say it! The word is bitch.
