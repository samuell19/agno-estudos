(WIND WHISTLING) PETE:I once set out to kill someone. I took pleasure in the thought of their death. It started back when things were a good deal simpler than they are now. And it started over a horse I called Ol' Sorrel. There's a time when a man and an animal get to know each other and decide if each one's right for the other. I'd just about decided that Ol' Sorrel traveled well, was free of vices, and would work out just fine. (WHINNYING) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (SIGHS) (WHINNIES) (EXHALES) (GROANS) I didn't lie to the man. I told him how the horse had bucked me off from a standstill. (SIGHS) Now you don't trust him, do you? Trust is everything, isn't it? How much are you askin'? I was sort of hopin' to get what I paid. Seventy-five dollars. Seventy-five. (CHUCKLES) I'll give you 75. He'll make a horse. -Little Boy, get my saddle down. -Right. That's my little brother. PETE:Then I saw at once the man had a casual way with horses. That was a talent I admired. You out here alone? My folks were killed in a car wreck over near Clayton last year. I bought this place with what they left. Figured I'd fix it up and put cattle on it. (CHUCKLES) You need any help, just give me a holler. I can't afford a hand. I'm not lookin' for work. I'm offerin' help if you need it. (OL' SORREL BLUSTERS) Let's go, Little Boy. So that's how it was that a horse named Ol' Sorrel started up the friendship between me and Big Boy Matson. -(COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC PLAYS) -Hey, Pete! You half-brained, dog-sucking son of a bitch! Get on over here! PETE:We started running together, chasing women, raising every kind of hell. I want you to meet my friend. I was finding out what good times were all about. Hell, I even started to think I knew something about life. I'd just drive for days in my car Every time I'd drink a bottle of booze Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! MAN: (ON RADIO) I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked... and dastardly attack... by Japan, a state of war... has existed between the United States... -Did you hear that, Little Boy? -Yes, sir. You know what this war means? -The price of beef will go sky high. -Yep. That all that you ever think about is beef? Yeah, well, I'll tell you what it means for me. I'm gonna be a Marine. -PETE: You're gonna be a Marine? -I'm gonna go on out and sign up right now. Little Boy, you're gonna stay home and look after the family and I'm gonna go off and be a Marine! Oh, hell, well, maybe if I had a wife and 11 kids I could stay and feel right about it. No, you couldn't. (CHUCKLING) Well, no, actually maybe you could. You don't need a wife. Hell, what you need is a husband. You send him off to war and you can just stay home, do the dishes and the crochet and everything else. -Step aside, cowboy. -Nancy, come on. -You're gonna draw back a stump. -You couldn't feel right about Zelda. -All right, you... -Oh! (SHOUTING) I knew you had some fight left in you! (SHOUTING) -Sieg heil! -Oh, look here. -We got ourselves a kraut in the making. -Oh, yeah! I've got you in my sights, you... (SHOUTING CONTINUES) (GUN COCKS) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) No damn Western Union, no letter, no nothin'. Had to hear over coffee in Lollipop's that you were walkin' the damn road like a hobo. (LAUGHING) I'd have met you at the bus or any damn place. -The ranch looks good, Levi. -Aw! Yeah, I nailed up a few boards, kept it from fallin' down. Hey, don't try anything like that. Come on, I'm flush with army pay here, all right? -Just for takin' care of my place. -I ain't broke. I don't want your money. (CHUCKLES) Oh. Thanks, Levi. Hey, you heard anything from Big Boy? I got a postcard a while back. Said he'd been in Tarawa. Newspapers said the Marines were in the thick of things over there. -Your truck running? -Ah, well, just about. Well, you ought to get yourself down to Sano. They're having fiesta tomorrow. Oh, yeah? I know a gal down there. Josepha O'Neil. You happen to see her? Oh, I ain't playin' no Cupid, but unless you want to hang around here lopin' your mule, you ought to get yourself down to Sano. (RANCHERA MUSIC PLAYING) So this woman... Over there she's called the mama-san. She brings this pretty little ol' gal over, says she's the best in the house. A hundred dollars. -A hundred dollars? -Mmm-hmm. Was it mink-lined? So I put my hand up there, andhijo de la chingada. It was like when a horse eats oats off the palm of your hand. Hoo-hoo! Then there's them that stayed here and got rich. MAN: Hey, Jim Ed. -How you doing? -How you doing, sir? You own a ranch, Pete. You could've gotten a deferment. Then you'd have a big fancy yellow car like Jim Ed there. Yellow's not my color. MAN 2: Howdy, Jim Ed! Yeah, well, it sure as shit's his color. While I was away my folks had to take a hay loan from him. Now that bastard's tryin' to grab their ranch. LITTLE BOY: Pete! -Little Boy! -So, how many Japs you kill? There ain't no Japs in Normandy. What do you hear from Big Boy? He got his ass shot three weeks before V-J Day. -He's in some hospital in San Diego. -He got shot? Yeah, he's okay, he'll be fine. You thinking about running cattle out at your ranch? Did you talk to him on the phone or anything? Mama did. She said he'd be home before too long. Hey, uh, Jim Ed's lookin' for hands, Pete. I'm workin' for him. Done real good. You wanna meet him? No, not just now, Little Boy. L.B., Pete. People call me L.B. now. -Okay. -Maybe some other time. -Good seein' you. -Mmm-hmm. (WOMEN SINGING IN SPANISH) Hi, Pete. Well, hi, Mona. How... How are you doing? I'm fine. How about yourself? Well, I'm back. (CHUCKLES) Am I keepin' you from somethin'? Or someone? No. Uh-uh. Not me. Well, you look good, Pete. Real good. (WOMEN CONTINUE SINGING) Uh, you want... You want to dance? Sure. PETE:She was right. I was looking for someone. But when she came up against me, like silver foil, all fragrance and warm pressure, everything else was gone from my mind. Mona. -(CHEERING) -(SONG ENDS) How about a drink? Got a bottle of whiskey in my car. -(MUSIC PLAYING) -Yeah. Sure thing. (WOMEN LAUGHING) Is it your car? My husband's. I married Les Birk. Ol' Les, Jim Ed's foreman? Ol' Les. Everyone else was at war. (SCOFFS) Kids? Let's talk about you. So now you're back, how do you figure to set the world on fire? Well, I saved my army pay. If I buy, mmm, maybe 150 head, price of beef, don't see how I can lose. (SIGHS) Yeah. The price of beef. I mean, I can day-work for a big outfit, keep the bills paid. Well, hopefully not Jim Ed. Not under Les. (MUSIC AND LAUGHING CONTINUES IN DISTANCE) Well, what's your worry? I'm not sure it'd be safe havin' you so close to home. How safe is us bein' out here? You know these country dances. A little foolishness can always be explained away. (KISSES) (MOANING) We'll get ourselves shot out here. (WOMEN CONTINUE SINGING IN SPANISH) These boys come back from the war with a stink on 'em that draws women like flies. Hell, it don't mean nothin'. Mona likes to dance and I don't like to dance. Unless it's the dance with no steps. Right, Les? Yeah, I like that one. L.B., go and get Mona back here. You know, every man in here could end up workin' for me. I don't want 'em dancin' with my foreman's wife. Pete, mind if I cut in? Uh, yeah, buddy. (INDISTINCT LAUGHTER) (ENGINE STARTS) Whew. (ENGINE STOPS) I don't see you for nearly two years, and you're leaving? Just like that? I'm sorry, Josepha. I was just too... Still a fool for Mona Birk? What, hell, no! She's someone's wife. Come on. Get in. Don't be hangin' on my runnin' board. It's so good to see you. Let's go by the river. -Okay. -(ENGINE STARTS) (COYOTES HOWLING IN DISTANCE) I've missed hearing that. Old Meesa says dead lovers come back as coyotes and cry for the love they've lost. Old Meesa? She's a witch. She can hex or heal anything. The Navajos think that'll be the last sound heard on the earth. I wanted you so much. I wanted you too. Promise me, if you can never really love me, tell me now. Don't ever ask me to say that. I know you're right for me, Josepha. I swear I do. (HAMMERING) Mmm. (MATCH STRIKES) Son of a bitch. (YELLS) (GRUNTING) Had you goin', didn't I? Had you haulin' ass for cover. Big Boy. You ass-shot bastard. Did you just get back? Near a week. I looked for you in Lollipop's. Said you went to a dance in Sano, then fell off the face of the earth. (LAUGHING) Well... I just been gettin' this place in shape for cattle. (GRUNTS) (EXHALES) I, uh, yeah, I heard you hit the beach at Tarawa. Yeah. Yeah, well... Hey. There's a sale up the railhead near Clayton. What do you say we, uh, go get you some cattle? Oh, hell, that thing won't make a 40-mile drive. Not till I fix the main bearing. (HORSE WHINNIES) What did they do to you in the army? Take the cowboy right out of you? Go get your goddamn horse saddled and let's get goin'. Lucky I'm back. Leave you too much longer to yourself, you'd be squattin' to take a piss. Yeah! That's what we want! (BOTH GRUNTING) Yeah, that's it! That's what I want! Come on! (CHUCKLES) You might have a package in those panties yet. -(YELLING) -Oh, yeah! -COWBOY: Hey, hey, hey! Ho! Ho! -(CATTLE LOWING) (COWBOYS YELLING) Like the look of the stock? Well, they're okay. Kinda weird-lookin'. I just bought these... And a hundred more like 'em. I don't know if we ever shook hands. I'm Jim Ed Love. I'm Pete Calder. These got some Brahma in 'em. -Brahma? -A new breed out of India. King Ranch is running over a thousand head. COWBOY: Bring those Brahmas over here. Well, I'm, I'm just lookin' for a decent price on regular cattle. -You saved up your army pay? -Yup. A young man comes back all full of energy, sees the price of beef. Looks like easy money, don't it? A decent living. It was once. Now it's a whole new game. Be smart, put your money in the bank, come to work for me. Let me risk the killer winters, fluctuatin' prices, thievin' brokers. Do you have any idea what long-haul truckin' costs just to get your cows to market? Well, people still drive cattle to railheads. (CHUCKLES) Only in the movies. You don't need to be workin' for him. A 35. Now the 40. Now the five. Now the $50 bid. Now 50-dollar-five. Sixty dollar. (AUCTIONEER CONTINUES) I know your place. You've got good range. In fact, some of your land borders one of my leases. Well, I'm hopin' my grass'll carry 150 head. But Jim Ed's got the price so high... I can get a decent price on 400 and then cut you out 150. I'd make a little somethin' and, uh, you'd get a good deal. Look, you want to work for my outfit? Let's drop our fences and pool a herd. That way you'd not run off and be tendin' your own cattle. Well, that... That sounds good, Mr. Young. Hoover. Just Hoover. I'll have a herd together by late tomorrow. You boys be ready to drive 'em back. Yes, sir. (COUNTRY WESTERN PLAYS ON JUKEBOX) Hey, things'll work out with Hoover. What do you think about that little dipshit brother of mine workin' for Jim Ed? I'd knock his brains out if I knew where to hit him. Come on. Kid's gotta make a wage. Oh, I never mentioned to Hoover anything about a wage. Oh, it'll be fair. You'll work for peanuts. Hoover don't pay worth a shit. Jim Ed pays 10 more dollars than Hoover. Can I get a couple more down here? So you were in Sano. What's that little gal's name? -Josepha. -Josepha. Yeah, but I also got someone else on my mind. Yeah? (CHUCKLES) Who? I'll tell you when it turns real. (CLATTERING) That there'd be your first month's wages. (SIGHS) Well, no shit. This place has live entertainment. Hey, Art. That's for all those tricks you do when Jim Ed cranks his organ. You should see him. Got a little cap. Little tail sticks out the back of his pants. It's cuter 'n hell. -ART: Really? -You're mine, shit-stick. I guess it's you and me, monkey face. Shit-stick? -(GUN COCKS) -NICK: Hey. Take it outside, boys. (GRUNTING) (GLASS SHATTERS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANS) That's enough! I'm done. Let's get back and finish drinkin'. (MEN GROANING) It's good to be back, pard. He hit me with a bottle. (SNICKERING) -COWBOYS: Hyah! Hyah! -(WHISTLING) (CATTLE LOWING) Whoo! -(CATTLE LOWING) -(COWBOYS WHISTLING) COWBOY: Go! (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) PETE:The pure, simple joy of a cattle drive. All that sky, all that land stretching out towards all horizons. There's no sense of freedom that ever sets a man so high, makes him feel, "Yeah, this is what I was born to do." But as we neared our home range in the Hi-Lo country, something else started welling up inside me. It had come with Mona's first touch. The sound of her voice. The brush of her lips. I'd known it once. Wanted to know it again. Hello there. -Hi, stranger. -I'll carry those. Sure, but my car's quite a ways off. -Yeah, I hope it's in China. -(CHUCKLES) So, I hear you were on a real old-time cattle drive. Yeah? And who told you that? In this town? -There's some real pretty country out there. -Mmm. You ever go ridin'? I like to ride. It's on a long list of things I like, but... ...don't get to do. Oh. Well, I'll tell you what. I was thinkin'... -About you and me maybe... -(DOOR CLOSES IN DISTANCE) Mmm. (WHISPERS) Les. -(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) -Okay. -We'll talk another time. -Mmm-hmm. Hey. Thanks for carrying my groceries. With your G.I. Bill, you could learn all about fixin' radios. You'd have a modern trade that's worth somethin'. I already got a trade. Cowboyin'. No, you're living in the past. A man can't make a living on less than 3,000 acres. -He can make a little money. -Yeah, to survive he does day work. And when he's old, no one wants him. You boys don't think about the future. -I don't want no goddamn future. -My future is another round. -Hey, Nick. -Hey, Nick! JIM: All right, boys. Little Boy. (COUNTRY WESTERN PLAYS ON JUKEBOX) (BOTTLE OPENS) (LIQUID POURING) Yeah? Got a hanky? A what? A hanky. (GLASSES CLINK) I think I noticed a little spot on the bottom of Jim Ed's shoe. Maybe chewin' gum or dog squeeze or somethin'. You get a hanky and get under that table and wipe it clean for him. (LAUGHING) BIG BOY: Give me another one, Nick. Hey, Nick, bring us a bottle of your best bourbon. Old Steve just did my books and he tells me I got cause to celebrate. What did you say? Don't do it in here. Why not? Come on now. What were your words? I said that you were having a banner year. A banner year. That's a round for everybody in this room. Poor bastards. I'm not drinking his liquor. I come back from the drive to find my folks livin' with my cousins. That son of a bitch Steve Shaw come out with some paper from the judge, put 'em off our land. Well, here's a double, Billy. Maybe you should talk to a lawyer. Lawyers and them all on the same side, against us. (JUKEBOX CLICKS) (GLASS SLAMS) You brought somethin' out to my folks while I was off drivin' cattle. I believe you said you served it on them. -Go back to the bar, Billy. -No. I got somethin' to serve on Steve and Jim Ed. Well, let's, uh... -Let's take a look at it. -And I got it right here. Hey! Hey! Goddamn! -(CHUCKLING) Jesus H. Christ! -Hey! Come on, boy! -I'll slit you like a lizard. -Son of a bitch. Do it. Ain't worth the grief, Billy. Go home. Spare yourself the sight of these dog turds. My home is gone. Come on, Billy. I'll take you out to your truck. Come on. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (COUGHING) Big Boy. That was a very levelheaded thing you did. I appreciate it. (SNICKERING) What have you got, Big Boy? 600, 700 acres? And yours, the old Mitchum place? 1600, tops. Times get hard. I'll see you boys come a-beggin'. JIM: You too,pendejo. (LAUGHING) Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Big Boy, you pissed him off like I never seen. Let's rob a bank, run all those sons of bitches out of town, burn the churches, buy a saloon and drink it dry. -Just let me load my pistol. -Whoo-hoo! (UPBEAT COUNTRY WESTERN PLAYS ON JUKEBOX) Two more, Nick. Mmm! Is somethin' wrong? Hell, no, cowboy. Somethin' is very right. Come on. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE) Hey, come on over here. I want you to meet somebody. MAN: Come on, boys! Mona, this is my best friend in the whole world, Pete. Sure. Hi, Pete. Hi, Mona. Hey, uh, listen, Levi says we can use his place. So go on over there and put that car in the shed behind the house. Door's open. Pete'll ride me over in a few minutes, just in case anybody's hangin' around. MONA: I'll be waitin'. Husband's out of town. Ran into her the day I got back. Started with a little small talk about the weather. Then, Lord God Almighty! Damn! -Aren't you, uh, worried about Les? -Whoo! Hell no. He ought to take better care of her. Besides, it's like my granddaddy said after he robbed the Gage County First National... "They got to catch you first." One look at her, you know she's worth the risk. Yeah. Hell, risk may be the best part of it. BIG BOY: Mmm-mmm. Just looking at her makes my teeth itch. You ain't said a word the whole ride. I just got nothin' to say is all. You're just amazed that Mona'd go for a dirt-poor cowhand like me. Uh, you want me to swing by later? No, go get yourself lucky. Levi'll give me a ride home in the morning. -How you doin'? -(MONA GIGGLES) (ENGINE STARTS) PETE:I knew exactly what I had to do. Mona was Big Boy's girl, and that meant I had to forget her, get her out of my thoughts. For me, she simply would not exist. (WIRE SNAPS) Ask me how I feel. How do you feel? Like a fucker and a fighter and a wild horse rider. Whoo-whoo-whoo-hoo! (CHUCKLES) Hey. Your heifer there. See her limping? Mmm-hmm. I guess, uh, you want heads? Well, not 'cause it's easier. You just need some work on the shitty end. -Appreciate that. -(CHUCKLES) (CATTLE LOWING) -Whoa! -(HORSE WHINNYING) Whoa. Whoa. (GRUNTING) Hey, uh, Mona wants to get together tomorrow durin' the day. (CHUCKLES) And we need a place. You can use my place. I'll stay away. (HORN HONKS) Hey, baby. -Better put your car in the barn. -PETE: Here. I'll do it. Go on in. How gallant. (ENGINE STARTS) How'd your dad happen to build a cabin way out here? He and my uncle used to hunt here when they were young. PETE: Nice. He told me if I ever took a boy to the cabin, he'd skin me alive. So you didn't tell him we were coming out here? No. I told him. I told him you were special. (SCOFFS) That mean we're gonna have to behave ourselves? I said you really cared about me, Pete. Well, yeah. Shouldn't be any question about that. I love you, Pete. I love you. -(MEN LAUGHING) -(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Ten big ones. (COUNTRY WESTERN PLAYS ON JUKEBOX) See your 10. And I raise you five. BIG BOY: Hey. Hell of a lot of bright ideas up there, Nick. PETE: Well, let's take on some. I'm feelin' a little bit ignorant today. Nick, whiskey. Make that two. On me. Well, lookie here. What's that old saw about... Lucky at cards, unlucky at love? Judgin' by the time I've been havin' with Mona, ol' Les must be rakin' in millions. Let's head on over to Raton. -Ah, forget it, Nick. -No, no, no, no. (CHUCKLING) That has the ring of keepin' me out of trouble, and you know that's a waste of time. (CLATTERING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Buy me a drink, Big Boy. I got cleaned out. Nick. Told you it was Les Birk's lucky night. Not Les Birk. Steve Shaw. Bastard took a month's pay. You with me? This game open to regular hands? Yeah, sure. (WHISPERING) You know, Steve, I think these boys are startin' to sweat it that you and I might start yawnin' and call it a night. I got no plans to leave. Well, now, it wouldn't be sportin', would it? You feel like leavin', you go ahead. (SNIFFS) No! Got all this money. It's time to start gettin' wild. I'll see that 20 and I'll raise it 100. (SPECTATORS GASPING) I'm gettin' wild like I promised. MAN: I'm out. You want to change the nature of this game? Here's your hundred. Another 50. (SPECTATORS MURMURING) STEVE: All right, I will... ...match that. No, I'm out. You know what? Let's quit all this piddly shit. I make this out to be about, mmm... Well, it's hard to count all this money, but it's $467. -Whoo! -(SPECTATORS MURMURING) On one goddamn hand? Oh, it's a good 'un. Hell, I'd bet Ol' Sorrel on it, and that's a good horse. You ask Pete. He sold him to me. Well, I'm not a crazy son of a bitch. Goddamn you. I thought we was gonna change the nature of this game, Les. Yeah. Nobody bluffs me by high playin'. Oh, that's right, Steve. Many's the time I've seen you high-play workin' cowboys right into the shitter. -Ain't that right, Mondragon? -That's right. He's bluffin'. BIG BOY: Well, that's easy to say now, Les, now that you're lettin' ol' Steve carry the weight for you. If he ain't chicken, he sure as hell has henhouse ways. (SPECTATORS LAUGHING) What's the matter, Steve? Need Jim Ed to do your thinkin' for you? Huh? (LAUGHING) (SHOUTS) Yee-hoo! Well, you know, the only time to let out a yell or take a drink of whiskey... is when you're by yourself... Or with somebody. Sure cure for ulcers. (MEN LAUGHING) (PUTS DOWN SHOT GLASS) You ever hear of long-pecker poker? (SPECTATORS LAUGHING) That's where you drop your pants and you get a measuring stick... Let's get back to the goddamn game. I call. -I got a straight. -(SPECTATORS MURMURING) Six high. BIG BOY: Well... (BIG BOY SIGHING) -All I got's three queens. -Hmph! (MURMURING CONTINUES) And a pair of 10's to go along with 'em. (SPECTATORS CHEERING) (ALL LAUGHING) Well, this is gonna be a banner year for me, Steve. I feel it. -Whoo. -(ALL LAUGHING) What's the matter, Steve? Where you goin'? Hey, Steve, come on back. I'll give you a dollar to help me count it. (LAUGHING CONTINUES) What is it, Steve? Come on, Steve. What is it? (GASPING) He's choking. (GASPING CONTINUES) Line 'em up, Nick. I'm fixin' to be God's own drunk and I want some company. Nick, give me the goddamn phone! The phone, damn it! NICK: Take it easy, Les. What's the problem, Les? Need some gas money? (PHONE RINGING) He's gone, Les. He's dead. Steve Shaw had a heart attack on the way to the car. (CROWD GOES QUIET) He just died. By the Lord Almighty, let's celebrate! I killed the son of a bitch without ever firing a shot. -Drinks all round! -(CHEERING) You're a son of a bitch. -What's that? -(CROWD GOES QUIETS) The man is dead. Haven't you got respect for anything? Not for him. Not for any of the scum-suckin' dogs toadyin' around Jim Ed, kissin' his ass. Is that a problem for you, Les? Hmm? What about you, Art? What about I stomp enough shit out of both of you to fertilize Texas, huh? Bastards tryin' to spoil our party. -Come on! -(ALL CHEERING) (ENGINE STOPS) (CHICKENS CLUCKING) What's all that? Christmas come early, Mama. -Hello, Pete. -Hello, Mrs. Matson. (ROOSTER CROWING) There's enough here for an army. I told Little Boy to get this fixed last week. Shouldn't spend all your wages on us. Oh, Big Boy had a big night at poker. (DOG PANTING) Should be saving your money towards havin' a wife, not spendin' it on us. The woman I want'll need a lot more than poker winnings, Ma. I used to know poker real good. Reckon it's in our blood, Grams. Poker's a bad game. My husband shot a man at poker. Then the man's brother shot him. My Tom, Big Boy's granddaddy, shot and killed two men... And later was shot dead himself. God knows... Shooting's been a curse on our family. BIG BOY: Stop braggin' about all the killin' we've done. You'll give ol' Pete the impression we're not church people. Oh, come on in. I'll make you boys griddle cakes. Well, no, we gotta get on over to Hoover's, Ma. Listen, when Little Boy gets here, you tell him to fix that railing. Doesn't do a damn thing around this place, lives here like it's a free boardinghouse. I love you. MAN: Got all your stuff? CHILD: Yes, Papa. (BUS DOORS SHUT) (CAR HONKING) Uh, Big Boy had to go to Cimarron with Hoover to look at some horses. He'll be here tonight. Oh. Got you a room in a real nice place. Anything'll look good after four hours on that bus. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Oh, in case you're worried, I'm in Colorado visiting the folks. So, what kind of wild time you got planned? -Hmm? -In Amarillo. (CHUCKLES) Say, you're not leavin' before Big Boy gets here, are you? No. MONA: I hope this thing doesn't blink all night. I hate things that repeat on and on without changin'. (KEYS JINGLING) Do you think we're crazy, Pete? It's not for me to say. Hmm. Makes no sense what I'm doin', but I gotta keep doin' it. Could you? Thanks. (SIGHS) Pete. Stop. Would you hand me my purse? Thanks. Pete. Thanks for everything. (SLAMS SHUT) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) BIG BOY: Pete! Hey, Pete! Come on, Pete! Hey! Let's go. Get up. Let's go. We're going out on the town. Come on. I'm kinda tired. -Tired? -Yeah. What kind of bullshit is that? Drinkin' alone in here in the dark... Like you got psychotic problems or somethin'. Mmm. (EXHALES) Come on. Get ready. Mona's waitin'. (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) What is it? You know, every minute of every day or night... I can feel every inch of you. Whether we're... Close to each other or you're away, you're in my blood, Mona. (JUKEBOX PLAYING) PETE:I thought gettin' really drunk would help, would've stopped me feelin' what I had no right to feel. I wanna run away with you, someplace where no one can find us. Mmm. We ain't ever gonna run anywhere. I'm gonna work hard and make a place for us right where we are. You just gotta hang on and not be scared. I'm not scared. I've been bored my whole life except for now. And then like the moon It fades from view (LAUGHING) Look at that lump on a log. Hey. Hey, Pete. Excuse me. Your face Smiling at me Hey, come on. Dance with Mona. Oh, no. I don't wanna dance. Come on, dance with Mona. Yeah. Come on. Get out there. Dance with her. Racing with the moon That is what I'll always do Till I overtake The moon and you I love him, Pete. I'd go with him wherever he wants. There ain't no fancy words for it. We just mesh, that's all. (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) (DOOR OPENS) PETE:I begged off early just to get away from 'em. I drove all through the night. By dawn, I made Hi-Lo. (GOATS BLEATING) Josepha. Pete. What are you doing in Sano? I just came to see you. So, how are you? How are your cattle? They're... Gettin' fatter. What is it, Pete? (CATTLE LOWING) I don't know, I don't know. It's just things. You know, there's a man here who cooks for Jim Ed. And he says Les Birk is gonna kill Big Boy. Then I'm gonna have to kill Les. Tontería. -What? -Nothing. What did you just say? That's a stupid thing to say, Pete. Well, goddamn it, he's my best friend, and there ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for him. Pete, your friend is stealing a man's wife. Then you don't understand what they feel, how deep it runs. -I know what it is to care deeply. -No, you don't. With that kind of love, nothing else matters, not the law, not... Not what people say... And not consideration for life or death. That kind of love they got is beyond all that. I don't mean... I don't mean to say that what you feel isn't deep. But when you say you love me, it's not the same thing, is it? Josep... Josepha. Josepha! I don't lie to you! PETE:But I did lie. In fact, lies were taking over my life. -(COWBOYS YELLING) -(CATTLE LOWING) I felt nothing for the day-to-day work that consumed everyone else, only more and more regret over my desire for Mona... And the deception I used to cover it up. (CATTLE LOWING) HOOVER: Take a good look. It's a lot better than we had last year now. We got four cents last year, and we got 500 on the hoof this year. All right. Let me hear it. Come on. Jim, come on. MAN: I'll give you seven and a half. See anything you like, Bob? Do you remember what you saw last year? And look at what you're seeing this year now. Beer, Mr. Love? Thanks, L.B. How about a beer, boys? BIG BOY: You've got 1,000 acres. My Ma's place is even less. Truth is, with less than 10,000 acres, a man could starve in this burned-out country. He can make it... If he works on the side. Yeah, and when he gets too old to be a hand, does he sweep out Jim Ed's bunkhouse? (GRUNTS) -God! Shit! -You all right? To hell with trucks and cars and airplanes... And paved roads and every other dadgum thing, except a good horse. (BELL DINGS) And a handsome woman. (TAPPING) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (FLIES BUZZING) Who wants what? Get me a Royal Crown. JIM: For me too, L.B. (TAPPING) (TAPPING) Little Boy! Come over here and help me change this tire. Well, now, I can't, see, because I'm workin' for Jim Ed right now, ain't I? -Workin'? -Yeah, workin', damn it. Runnin' to bring him soda pop? JIM: Go ahead, L.B. You have my permission. Give your brother a hand. (SPITS) (KEYS JINGLING) (ENGINE STARTS) -What? -We're gonna talk. (BELL RINGING) That wasn't very smart. Well, let's not argue about who's being smart these days. You gotta break it off with him. For 50 miles in every direction, people are talkin' about how Les or Jim Ed's men or somebody's gonna gun him down. I don't intend to let that happen. Oh, so now suddenly you're the concerned best friend. You're goddamn right I am. Pete. I know what you really are, and so do you. -I see it in your eyes. -Maybe once but not anymore. Bull. It's there right now, as plain as day, and even when I'm with him. What's eatin' at you... Ain't no high-minded concern for your best friend. (SONG PLAYING ON JUKEBOX) I love you so much BIG BOY: Hey, there you are. I thought this was gonna be a lonely drunk. Two more. -Doubles? -Yeah, sure. Hey, why you packing that thing? Huh? Let's put it out in the truck. Uh-uh. It suits my mood. Hey, Little Boy. -Two beers, Nick. -Uh, I'm buyin'. Give my little brother whatever he wants. I worked his sorry ass off today. (SONG CONTINUES PLAYING ON JUKE BOX) Of course he ain't really worth a fart in a whirlwind. NICK: How you boys doin' down here? I'm tired of you looking worried all the time. You're my friend, and I am worried. Yeah, well, I know what I'm doin'. I know exactly what I'm doin' at all times. I know what I'm doin' being with her. You see, Pete, I am one sombitch who can judge women. Not many men can. Lots of 'em can judge horses. A man that knows horses don't really need to look at their teeth. He can just tell that an old pony with holes above his eyes, a droopin' lower lip and a sunken butthole is past the go-get-'em stage. But it takes a master to tell if a horse has got bottom. Some of the best conformed horses in the world ain't got bottom. They will let you down when you get in that old bind. But now... A fella can't go around lookin' to see if a woman has got knobby knees or a sunken butthole, now can he? (CHUCKLES) He got to be able to sense it. A good woman is like a good horse. She's got bottom, what Ol' Sorrel's got. Now, that old horse will go day and night. When the wind is tryin' to tear your head off... And when a wild cow cuts back through the brush, Ol' Sorrel's right there, runnin', turnin', workin' his heart out for you. But now, Mona... This Mona that everybody's so damn interested in... (BIG BOY CHUCKLING) She is a beautiful woman. But that ain't all. She's got bottom. And she's gonna make me a partner to go along with Ol' Sorrel. And there ain't no backstabbin', gossipin' bunch of yellow-bellied chicken shits gonna stop me. Carry the message, you bastards. (COWBOYS WHOOPING) MAN: (OVER PA)The time to beat is a 12 and 5/10 of a second ride. He's got a hold of his... Oh! Help him a little bit. And he's gonna pin him down. The only trouble is he's gonna be a little long. One second too long, but he's still in the money. -Give him a hand. He's our hero. -Whoo! Here he goes. Pete, hang on! It's gonna be a long eight seconds. Hang on, Pete! -(CROWD CHEERING) -He bucked him off! Give him a hand, folks! BIG BOY: You do good. You know I can judge bulls, and this is a good one. He'll put you in the money. That's where I aim to be. You just settle down. Find your balance and stick there. Remember, he turns left hard on the third jump. -All right. -You ready yet? Yeah, all right. Just hold your shorts. We'll be there. Let's see how you got that rope. You can take a wrap. He ain't gonna hang you up. Now, just settle down. Okay, take a breath. (EXHALES) All right, you ready? You'll be fine. (CROWD CHEERING) ANNOUNCER:Oh, no! He's loose! Oh, no! He's in trouble! Big Boy's gotta help him! Shit. Bullfighters and clowns, get in the middle of this. -I can't get ahold of him! -Hey! Son of a bitch got me airborne. Maybe you should get that thing stitched up. Hell no. Best thing for a puncture is to leave it open. You got any horse liniment, Levi? LEVI: That don't look so good, Big Boy. You ought to see a doctor about that. Oh, all I need is something to drink. LEVI: I got you there, Big Boy. I'll hold you In my heart Till I can hold you in my arms Like you've never Been held before I'll think of... BIG BOY: Levi. (SINGING CONTINUES FAINTLY) (CHAIN JINGLING) When I'm away from you I'll hold you In my heart Till I can hold you in my arms Who have we got for when it goes bad? There's Mondragon... And Billy Harte. Please wait for me Hi, Josepha. Hi. Wanna dance? The stars up in the sky Know the reason why I feel so blue When I'm away from you I'll hold you In my heart Till I can hold you in my arms So, darling Please wait for me You want to stop dancing? I saw her come in. I gotta keep an eye on things. You understand? The stars up in the sky We'll dance again in a while. Know the reason why I feel so blue When I'm away from you Loosen up. Come on. I'll hold you In my heart Till I can hold you in my arms So, darling Please wait for me (HIGH-PITCHED VOCALIZING) (APPLAUDING) (MOUTHS) Thank you. -(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING) -Let's keep dancin'. Not right now. Would you get me a drink? Deep within my heart lies a melody A song of old San Antone All right. Where in dreams I live with a memory Beneath the stars all alone Now, it was there I found beside the Alamo Enchantment strange as the blue up above A moonlit path that only she would know Still hear my broken song of love Moon in all your splendor Know only my heart Call back my Rose Rose of San Antone Lips so sweet and tender Like petals fallin' apart Speak once again of my love, my own Broken songs, empty words I know Still live in my heart all alone For that moonlit path by the Alamo And Rose my Rose of San Antone (GUN COCKING) -Big Boy! -(WOMAN SCREAMS) You son of a bitch! (GUNSHOT) (BOTTLES CRASHING) (ALL GRUNTING) (GUNSHOTS) (GRUNTING) MONA: Big Boy! Big Boy! BIG BOY: Get off me! Stop! Stop! (UPBEAT SONG PLAYING) Where the hell were you? Deep within my heart lies a mel... -Whoo! -Take that. Go along to the truck. I'll watch the door and yell if they come. You see my little brother? That mewlin' piece of shit! Look, we gotta get outta here, and you gotta lay low till things cool down, all right? (SNIFFING) (PANTING) Um... Hey, I don't wanna see you shot. Hey, you got more sense than I do, yet you were in there kickin' ass against all of 'em. Ah, here she is, your Joey. PETE: Josepha. BIG BOY: Josepha? Damn, you're even prettier than I remember. It's okay. It's all right. I'm fine. It's all over now. Decide whose side you're on? Mmm. Mmm. Well, let's not stand around here all night in the line of fire. Let's go to Silver Springs, have our own party. Children, let's drink. (LAUGHING) -That's a pretty dress, Mona. -Thanks. Uh, I made it myself. (LAUGHS) I like to sew, but I'm not very good at it. Well, like anything, it takes practice. Argh! Practice. So you don't have children, Mona? You and Les? No. No kids. Mmm-mmm. BIG BOY: Hey! Quit hoggin' that whiskey. -Give it here before it spoils. -(COUGHING) There you go. All right. So, when are you two getting married, hmm? (LAUGHING) Maybe she wouldn't have me. Oh. Oh! (LAUGHS) MONA: I... I think she would. (LAUGHING) No. Pete, not here. Not now. (BIG BOY AND MONA LAUGHING) Why don't we go to see Meesa the witch? What? She'll tell us about the future. BIG BOY: I'm ready to go see the witch. Hell, Mona, let's go see if we can get that husband of yours dissolved. (CHUCKLES) JOSEPHA: I'm gonna tell you something. You can think I'm cheap or vicious. But I love you very much, and I've waited a long time for you. She's a cheap ex-prostitute and a phony. She's the biggest phony in this county. You're just jealous, and that is what this is about, ain't it? You're damn right I am. And you are a fool. You and Big Boy are both fools. You think she's gonna make him a nice little wife who'll cook and clean and sew? She didn't make that dress. She lied. -I saw her buy it in Raton. -You still... And I have friends who know her folks. You stupid horny cowboys. I don't care about her and Big Boy. But she flirts with you as a second choice, and you act like a fool. Like you can't help yourself. MEESA: Hello, my son. Howdy. Sit down. You want the cards or the crystal? The crystal? Oh. Yeah, yeah, that'll be fine. So, what do you wish to know? I wanna know if all of us who are here tonight will be alive and prosperous next year. No. What did she say? Go and hear for yourself. Where's Big Boy? He's passed out in Mona's car. Dead drunk. Don't use that word. That was fast. She said there was nothin' in my cards. How would you like hearin' that? Nothin'. Take a walk with me. Damn it, all she did was glance at the cards. Then she picked 'em up and stacked the deck. Pete, what did she tell you? Hmm? She talk about us? Me and Big Boy? PETE:Maybe it was what the old witch said about death... The thought that nothing mattered. It was fate. It had to end tragically. Maybe I thought the terrible desire I had for her could be purged. I don't know. -I've thought about it every day since. -(FABRIC RIPPING) I just don't know. (MOANING) (GRUNTS) Come up to Meesa's. She'll give you a shawl to cover yourself. You better tell Big Boy before she does, or he'll kill you. PETE:She didn't understand. I had no fear of dying. My fear was about how I'd live... With all the pain I'd caused. (COW LOWING) Where the hell you been? I've been, uh, checkin' the far ranges for stragglers. We've lost a few to coyotes. This one here is mine. It's been near a week you haven't taken a meal at Hoover's. I was worried you fell down a well. Just been workin'. (LOWS) Well, there's somethin' in them clouds. -Maybe even a blizzard. -(LOWS) Come on to the ranch and get some dinner. I think Hoover'd like it if you stuck a little closer to home. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Yeah. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (LOWING) (WIND HOWLING) (HORSES WHINNYING) It's startin' to go down. We should drive 'em off the high ground into the arroyos. (WHINNYING) (GRUNTING) You okay, Hoover? I heard something crack up inside. I'm sorry, Hoover. My horse went right out from under me. (GROANS) Well, get him up! Get me on him! I can't, Hoover. He's lame. His leg's broke. (GROANING) Something's broke inside. I can feel the pieces moving. (GROANING) (SCREAMING) -(GRUNTING) -Easy now. Take it easy, boy. -(HORSE GRUNTS) -Easy. (SMASHING) Jesus! Do you think he's dead? He will be if we don't get him in. Give me the reins. -Now, you stay close behind Ol' Sorrel. -All right! If need be, grab hold of his tail. Get up, you crazy bastard! (GRUNTS) Pete, listen. I'm goin' in with Hoover. I'll come back for you. You just keep movin'. Pete! Grab hold of that wire. Let me see you do it. You can do it, Pete. Come on! Okay, you hang on. Just keep movin'. Don't turn loose, or you'll lose your direction. I'll never find you. Just, uh, keep movin' post to post. Movin'! Keep movin'! Move, Pete! (GRUNTS) PETE:Alone out there, I put myself in Big Boy's place, thinking that if he'd done to me as I did to him, I'd have left him to die. So the thought of my death seemed like justice well served. (WIND HOWLING IN DISTANCE) (GRUNTS) (WATER RUNNING) -Did Hoover eat anything? -No. Mrs. Young tried to give him some soup, but he couldn't get it down. Thinks his hip's broken. Broken hip. That's like a broken leg, ain't it? You set it and everything's all right. No, I don't think it's as simple as a broken leg. -Said he had a fever too. -(DOOR OPENS) Phew! BILLY: How'd it go? BIG BOY: The ones that could still walk, we got 'em in. There's a lot of dead stock in the south pasture. Afraid most of 'em had your brand. Well, I guess I wasn't meant to be a cattle baron. BIG BOY: Sorry, pard. (DOOR OPENS) MRS. YOUNG: Big Boy. When you're finished, Hoover wants to see you. I'll go see him now. MRS. YOUNG: He's in an awful lot of pain right now. (WHISPERING CONTINUES) The boys are all here. No, I'm not alone. He wants to talk to all of us. Uh-huh. Hello, boys. -Hoover. -Hoover. -Hello. -Big Boy. (EXHALES) HOOVER: Look, I wrote something up. I need you to witness it. Here. (SIGHS) Uh, Big Boy'll have a 25% piece of my operation. He'll be runnin' it. And he'll take care of Mrs. Young. Hoover, you're gonna be up and around. I don't know, Billy. I'm not taking any chances on... ...leavin' business unfinished. Thanks, boys. I'll say good night now. Billy. -Delfino. -Night, Hoover. Pete. PETE:Hoover didn't live to see the spring. -Good morning, gentlemen. -Howdy. -How goes it? -All right. (CATTLE LOWS) (HORSE WHINNIES) BIG BOY: They're lookin' good. Late snow always brings good grass. Yeah, by shipping time they should be full weight. I've been doing some calculating, Pete. It's part of my job now that I'm running things. You figure the weight you lose from drivin' 'em over land to the railhead. Makes more economic sense just to load 'em into trucks and haul 'em there. You not figuring on a cattle drive? Part of my job is thinking about profit. (LAUGHING) Had you going, didn't I? You bet your ass we're gonna drive 'em. Hell, yeah. Hey, who gives a damn about profit when it's this much fun being a cowboy? Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! (KISSES) -(KNOCKING) -(MONA SQUEALS) Hey. Whoo! (SQUEALS) (LAUGHS) How you doin', Pete? Uh, hello, Mona. Saw your car out front. Uh, you think that's a good idea? Hey, we don't care who sees us now. I moved out on Les. I'm livin' with my cousin. Get your boots shined and your suit pressed 'cause were gonna make it legal. (LAUGHS) That's great. Hey, can you ride me over to tell Mama and Grandma? -Mona's gotta go see a lawyer about a divorce. -(MONA LAUGHS) I'm so happy I could bust. (WATER RUNNING) Pete. I'm gonna have a baby. He's gonna be a daddy. BIG BOY: What Hoover did for me changed my life. I was afraid to even think about marriage. Scared of not being able to provide. Seeing my wife doin' laundry behind some bunkhouse. That won't be. No, sir, that will never be. Not for me or you, partner. 'Cause whatever's good for me is good for you. By the way, I want you to be my best man. -MRS. MATSON: Hey there, Big Boy. -Hey, Ma. I had this lumber and tin roofin' sent out here two weeks ago for Little Boy to fix this place up. -Hi, Pete. -Howdy, ma'am. You come on in. I've got some food ready. Ma, where's Little Boy? He's asleep. He was out until just before dawn. That so? Big Boy, don't you take to quarrelin' with him now. BIG BOY: (SHOUTING) Get up! Get the hell up! MRS. MATSON: Do you hear me? Leave him be! BIG BOY: Get up! LITTLE BOY: What's going on? MRS. MATSON: Big Boy... BIG BOY: Get out there! -What'd I do now? -Don't start... What the hell is that? Mom, I told you I was gonna fix the roof today, didn't I? Don't bullshit me! I'm sick and tired of your goddamn lies! That's been sittin' there for two weeks! MRS. MATSON: Big Boy, leave him be! You live here, you eat their food, they wash your damn clothes, -and you do nothin'! -(KICKING) This place is fallin' down around their ears, and you don't give a damn! I'm leavin', aren't I? You lazy, no-good, worthless piece of shit! I'm leavin'! (GRUNTING) (COUGHS) -All right! -(COUGHING) Now, come on! Leave off him! Come on! He's had enough! Big Boy, don't hit him no more. Make me a promise. All right, Mom, I ain't touchin' him. Once again Mama saved your chickenshit little ass. (COUGHS) (SPITS) (COUGHING) Hey! (GUN COCKING) Don't think you can mess me around no more. I'm tired of being screwed with. You hear me? Pete, take Mama inside. -Take her inside. -You come on, Mrs. Matson. Little Boy. Don't be a fool. Give me that damn thing before you get me mad. (GUNSHOT) No! (GUNSHOTS) MRS. MATSON: (SHOUTING) Oh, my God, no! Shit. Who would've thought my little brother... -Pete. -Yeah? (COUGHING) (WHISPERING) Tell Mona... (COUGHS) Fight it. Fight it, Big Boy. Big Boy, fight it. (IN SOFT VOICE) Ma. (EXHALES) (SOBBING) (GUN COCKS) (DOOR OPENS) What about him? So, does that son of a bitch just go on livin'? (CAR DOOR CLOSES) Pete. I know what's in your mind, Pete. Would have been in Big Boy's mind if it were you that was in that grave. I'm askin' you to let it be. Let him rot in jail. It was self-defense. Mother and I have got no one. What's to be served by havin' Little Boy jailed? God knows there's been too much of that in our family. But he shot him down like a dog. You want me to lie when I testify? He's the only one left. I don't want to lose him. You're Big Boy's mama. I can't refuse you. Big Boy was like his Pa. Ever since he was born, I feared he would end in violence. Pete. I came here with more than half a mind to kill you. But for your mama's sake, I'm gonna go along with this self-defense bullshit. But wherever I am, if I ever hear you said anything about Big Boy that casts a shadow on his memory, I will kill you. Hey, Pete. It's pretty much over. That's the way I wanted it. -Thanks. -Come here. I couldn't bear going in the church or... ...stand to see him put in the ground. I can't bring myself to admit it's over. (SNIFFLES) Did he tell you about the name? Mmm-mmm. I thought he might have mentioned it. If it's a boy, his name's Pete. I think it's a boy. Wouldn't it figure, Big Boy'd make a boy? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Yeah, that sure would. What now, Pete? Oh, I don't know. I'm sellin' my place, movin' on. (MONA LAUGHS) I, uh... Never had the guts to tell him what I did. He knew. I told him right after it happened. I said the blame was not all yours. So you're leavin'. Where are you headed? Maybe California. (LAUGHS) -I heard Josepha went to California. -Well, yeah, I heard that too. I see. Do you, uh... Need anything? Any money or, uh... Don't worry. I'd like to be alone now with him. Yeah, I know. Well... (SNIFFLES) Good luck out there in California. Thanks. -(LAUGHS) -I'll need it. (SOBBING) PETE:When I left the Hi-Lo country, I didn't give a thought to my ranch or the price of beef... ...or my abandoned dreams. In my mind's eye, I saw Big Boy. I saw the good times we had... The hell-raisin', the cowboyin', the old ways that lived on in that man... And would live on in my memory for the rest of my days. (MAN SINGING) I'll hold you In my heart Till I can hold you in my arms So, darlin' Please wait for me The stars up in the sky Know the reason why I feel so blue When I'm away from you I'll hold you In my heart Till I can hold you in my arms So, darling Please wait for me
