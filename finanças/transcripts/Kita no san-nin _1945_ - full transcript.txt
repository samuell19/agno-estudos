Emergency landing in Aomori. Hey! Radio operator! Contact Aomori Airfield. Message from transport plane 60. On course to Hokkai Airfield. Requesting emergency landing due to technical problems. Radio guided approach possible? Roger to radio guidance. Conditions are tough, so do your best on the radio guidance. Emergency landing of plane 60. Prepare for immediate landing. Yes, technical problems. They might stay over night. Prepare crew lodging. Yes sir! Prepare for emergency landing of cargo plane 60. Understood! Prepare for landing under poor visibility.

Engine sound - north! Guidance, all clear? Turning! 182 degrees! 181 degrees! 180 degrees! On landing path! Roger! Clear for landing! I'm afraid the technical problems will ground you here for the night. Lodgings are ready for you. A car will take you there shortly. And tomorrow? - Not sure yet ... That we'd meet again like this! How is your health? Thanks, I am doing well. Like this, I might even make a come-back. Really? What a relief! Captain? Tomorrow? We will fly! Yes, the plane has to arrive in Chijima tomorrow. I understand. Do your best. - Yes! Hey, Matsumoto! What's up? Exhausted? - No ... This is Mr Masaki, the airfield chief. Yoshie Matsumoto, radio operator. On my way to report for duty at Chijima Airfield. Up to Chijima? Your first time in the North? Yes, I've been on duty in Tokyo so far. Cherry trees must be in bloom there. Here it'll take a little longer. But up at Hokkai Airfield or at Chijima Airfield ... ... the weather is even harsher than here, you'll see. Hokkai Airfield is still covered in snow. In Chijima you'll still have a lot of drift ice. Yes, so I heard. Well, good luck and all the best. Chjima is the heart of the North. Yes. Oh, there's someone you know. Our radio operator, Sumiko Uneo? Yes ... We trained together. Oh, really? She's on duty now. There, down the corridor. Why not pay her a visit later? Yes ... Is that the woman who was in charge of our radio guidance? Yes. Why? Well, I should not say this in front of Matsumoto ... I never thought that such a young woman ... ... could do such a great job as a radio operator! That just shows that you lack imagination. Nowadays women can become excellent radio operators. Well, I never thought that way. You should! We have three radio operators here. The two men are down sick. So Ueno is all by herself. And not just here! There are several female operators in other places. Ms Goto at Hokkai Airfield for example. She trained with Matsumoto and Uneo. Isn't that right? - Right. So Hokkai Airfield has a female radio operator? HOKKAI AIRFIELD It's freezing! Goto, my turn now! Plane 60 is grounded at Aomori. In Aomori? We don't know any details yet. The friend who sent you that letter might be aboard. Yes, possibly. All that waiting in vain. Of course you could just contact her in Aomori. But we can't use the radio for private matters! Sick Since last Autumn Once I am dead ... I guess you can't wait? Nobody here for you to have a chat. Well, being on the radio feels like talking to a friend. You mean Ms Ueno? She does have a special voice ... I can almost imagine what she looks like. What's that? A plane? It's Aomori. The problems with plane 60 are the result of cylinder damage. Repairs to be completed today, take-off expected tomorrow. Hello. Thank you for today. My name is Ishii, radio operator on cargo plane 60. I am so happy you made it. Thanks to you! You saved us! No way! I'm not that good. No, you were great! Even we could not beat you to it. Well ... I mean it. You should be proud of yourself. Thank you very much. I am doing my best. Operator! The captain is waiting. - On my way! What's wrong? You face is all red. Did you stick your head into the fire? Must be a cold. Any fever? Nothing serious. All right, take care. You really have to take care. Many people have a bad cold. I am the only healthy radio operator left. It's fine, don't worry. Oh, by the way ... We have Matsumoto with us. Have you seen her? Matsumoto? The radio operator! What? Matsumoto is here? Yoshie! So nice to see you! What a surprise! You never told me you were going to Chijima. How are you? - Fine, as you can see. And how about you? How about your parents? Fine thanks. I really missed you. Why didn't you come to see me right after landing? Come inside, you'll get sick out here in the damp fog. What's wrong? Sumiko! The truth is, I did not want to see you. I wanted to go to Chijima without seeing you again. But why? You should know the reason. So ... You still misunderstand the thing about Kazuo? Misunderstand? Still looking for excuses? You are the one who betrayed my brother. He could not wait to get married to you. When he was drafted, he said: "I failed at being a good son." I will never forget that. He just could not forget you. Calling operator Ueno! Stay with me in the dorm tonight. We must talk things over. Please ... Who knows when we'll meet again. Radio operator Ueno! Yoshie! Radio operator Ueno! Sorry to keep you all waiting! The cars are ready to take you to your lodging. Please get ready. Hello? Hello? Is that the air field? The radio room? This is the observation post. The observation post's report on the fog conditions. Is it Mr Hara? Yes, I will repeat: Thick sea-fog ... Southeast of the observation post. Reaching areas north of the sea corridors. No clear spots over the strait. Clearing up gradually when moving west. Fog height ... On the sea: approx. 200m. At the mountain slope: 300m. Oh yes: Clear skies expected in one hour around the air field. End of transmission. Ah, hello? Hello? Just one moment. Hey, Hara! Won't you talk to her? What? The radio girl. Akiko doesn't know that you are going home tomorrow, right? Who knows when you will see each other again. Say good-bye to her. What can I say? What a weird guy you are! Don't you have anything to say to her? For example ... "I have to return home. It was a pleasure working with you." "Take good care of yourself." ...? Or: "I hope we'll see each other again soon." I am on my way to the air field for the paper work anyway. I'll talk to her then. But wouldn't it be nicer to let her know right now? Why? "Why?"? Then I'll tell her. Just drop it ... Hello? Sorry I made you wait. Hara is returning to the main land. To present the collected data, yes. He is on his way down now and will take the ship tomorrow. Mr Hara is leaving? With tomorrow's ship? I see. Thank you. Mr. Hara is leaving? Yes. He'll come here to say good-bye later. It will be lonely around here with Mr Hara leaving. I'll be off then. If I could die I would not feel this grief You should be on your way. Are you ready? Yes. I kept this bottle of whisky. Let's have a farewell drink. In Tokyo the cherry blossoms must be in bloom by now. Cheers! Take all your stuff. Your masterpiece. Can I keep it? No, I want to give it to Akiko. A token of gratitude. That's a great idea. You can be quite thoughtful too. Akiko will be glad. Who knows? - She will. No doubt. I know it. Akiko always looks quite lonely. But when you are near, she suddenly looks happy. On your way back? - Yes. I'll be leaving tomorrow. Thank you for all your help. Yes, Mr Mochizuki told me so. Congratulations on your research progress. It's too early for that. It's still a lot of work. But your cloud forecasts, they were right so many times. It's such a big help. - No ... It's an unstable climate here. Very hard to predict. And the weather does complicate the war more and more. There isn't much we can do. But how much we could do, if we could be more precise ... If there's anything you want to send home, I can take it. It'll be quicker than by post. No need to worry ... - It's not about worrying. I just want to be of use. I caused you so much work with my weather materials. But you helped me so kindly. I am very grateful. No, there was nothing I could do. I'll pay you a visit tonight. You really don't have to. - Don't worry, it's nothing. Then I'll be waiting. That's his last photo before leaving for the front. He sent it with his last letter. Yoshie ... I ... I never thought about marrying anybody else than Kazuo. He will always be the only man for me. But ... At that time I just did not feel ready to marry. It would have meant giving up my job. That was impossible. They say a radio operator to a pilot is like the oxygen to a diver. And I was the first woman chosen for this important job. I wanted to give my best. As a woman ... I wanted to show how good I would be as a radio operator. This might seem selfish. But it's up to us to prove what we can do. Yoshie, listen ... It was after you had left for your training in Kyushu. A hot day in early summer. I met Kazuo in the park of the Ise Shrine. I told him how I felt. How I really felt inside. And Kazuo really understood me. Sowing the seeds for victory ... ... is up to us, the young people. He gave me even more courage. My brother ...? - Yes. But ... It's so hard for a woman. When I came here, after parting from him ... ... I felt so miserable that I almost changed my mind. And in the end it was Kazuo, who made me go through with it. Now I am here, all I do is give my best at work. Sure, sometimes I feel sad or lonely. But I can do this. And I think it is thanks to Kazuo. Yoshie ... Even now ... I always ... I think of Kazuo every day. Sumiko! My brother has died in action. He's dead? About a month ago, we got secret news from the front. It was during the Burma operation. His company got outnumbered and surrounded by the enemy. He asked to be the leader of a suicide corps. In the middle of a heavy battle ... He was on the front, in charge of his men. He got hit by a bullet, and fell. One of his men called out to him. He looked up and ... ... tried to continue to command. Maybe he had used up all his strength ... it was his last breath. Later, his commanding officer sent me a letter. Good evening. Who's there? It's us. Welcome. Please, do come in. We can't. We were supposed to hear about radio operation. But now we have to go up to the observatory. Now? - Yes. Kimi's mother has suddenly become very ill. And Kimi is on observatory duty tonight. So we go and take over. Oh ... How kind of you. We came to apologise for breaking our appointment. Don't worry. We are off then. - Take care. Good-bye. Sumiko! Forgive me. Please, forgive me. I hated you so much, but I had no idea ... It's all right, Yoshie. I ... I should have married him ... That would have been the right thing. - Sumiko! My brother would be glad. So glad ... You and I are two cherry blossoms Even if we fall separately The capital of flowers is Yasukuni Shrine We meet each other in the treetops in spring Those girls climb up the mountain at night up to the observatory. Up the mountain at night? Even on a rainy or windy day. Always looking eager. Look, we have to be as eager as they are! Let's do our best. Yes. That's the one thing I can do. Take Kazuo's place and fulfil my duty. Good evening. Sorry it got late. - There must be so much to do. And now you waste your time on me. - Don't worry about that. Come here, next to the fire. I am leaving tomorrow ... - Please, do sit down. All right, I'll warm myself up. It's very cold outside. - Yes. Please, no fuss about me. It's nothing special, but it will warm you up. Ah, sweet sake? Yes ... - Thank you. Ah, it's really good. How about one more? - Yes. Thank you. My mother at home also likes to make sweet sake. How is your mother? She's fine. She's 60 and had to move houses a few times. But she always lived in the countryside and is tough. She's still working. Compared to her, I still feel like a snotty-nosed brat ... Not really ready to be an adult. And you? My parents are dead. - Both of them? Yes. - And siblings? I don't have any. My father died just after I was born. My mother lived till I was thirteen. Then my uncle took care of me, as if I was his own child. I also have really good friends. Now I'm really busy with work. I never feel lonely. I see. There was a big persimmon tree behind our house. I loved climbing trees. My mother would catch me every time I climbed up. "You weren't even born in a monkey year, but you behave like a monkey!" Of course I sometimes wish my parents were still around. But then, I'd probably be in a normal marriage by now. I wouldn't have met you or Mr Mochizuki. There is nothing as mysterious as the bonds that link people. You could call it the beauty of fate. It makes life interesting. Right ... Do you want me to take anything with me? This one... Sorry to bother you. Aiko ... Even up here, it's not always cold in winter. Spring will come. Very soon. - With the spring flowers. The Ezo-Cherry. The Northern Pika, the Chishima-Astragalus. The will bloom. - Yes. It's a short period, but it's beautiful like a dream. I've got something for you. This. Ah, how cute. I carved it in my free time. Will you have it? I will, thank you. It makes me glad. I will take good care of it. - I'll be off then. Take care. You too, take care of yourself I'll be back. To continue my research. I'll be back while you are still here. Please wait for me. Hello? Yes, that's right. Good morning. Yes, I'll repeat. Yes - clear skies. Northwest wind, 3 metres. No lower clouds. Yes. Fog moving south over the sea. Scattered in some places. Yes. End of transmission. Visibility: Zero. The layer is getting thicker. Difficult flying conditions. Yes? The plane is ready. - Thanks. Ah, Kajima! You worked through the night? Yes. - Thank you. No problem. We should fly. We might be in for a tough flight until we reach Southern Chijima. But the skies in that direction are clearing up. Chief! Plane 60 is on a special mission! We can't let this chance with this weather go past! Situation at the front rapidly deteriorating. Today's flight needed under any circumstances. Hokkai Airfield Chief. Are you up to a blind flight? Let's do it. I'm sure we can do it. I trust you. May the gods protect you. Captain! What? What?! What's wrong? Radio operator Ishii collapsed. - Ishii?! He was not doing well yesterday. It's acute pneumonia. He himself is determined to fly. But the doctor demands him to stay in bed. I see ... I'll check up on him once more. - Yes, thanks. From Chijima Airport. "Proceed flight in any circumstances. Good weather at this location." They say the radio operator is down with pneumonia. The radio operator? What about the flight then? Nobody knows ... Is there anyone who can take over Mr Ishii's radio? But plane 60 must be on its way today, right? Sumiko. Do you think I could take over? You? I can do it. I'm sure I can. With you and Akiko on the other side ... But ... - What if it was you? What would you do? I am a radio operator on the flight to Chjima. I'll do it! Even if I die. Isn't it our duty to do all we can? The B29s have women on their radios. And they bomb our country. I can do this. Captain! Please let me take over Mr Ishii's post. You? Instead of Ishii? Yes. Plane 60 must be on its way to Chjima today. I heard it's a special mission ... - That's absolutely right. It's a crucial mission. But you ...? - Yes ... I am up for it, if you let me do it. I appreciate your offer. But you have no experience ... But I was trained to do it ... - That's not enough! Look, we are facing very harsh conditions. The flight's fate relies on the radio operator's skill. I know that. Listen, Matsumoto ... Why are you so determined to take over this difficult task? It's my duty. As a radio operator, I want to contribute to the mission's success. Fine, how good are you? Compared to Miss Ueno? During training radio operator Matsumoto was ... ... better than me. And now? The same, I believe. All right! What if something happens? I am ready ... Chief! Matsumoto will be on the radio. - But ...! It's all right. I experienced Miss Ueno's skills yesterday. What we need on top ... ... is someone ready to give their life! And didn't you say yourself that female radio operators are ... I meant in the future ... Let's make it now! It might be different in peace. But in war, we have no time to lose. Chief! I'll be in command. We'll give all that we have. All right then! Plane 60 will be taking off very soon. Let me guide you to the air field. Yoshie. Do it for all the female radio operators. I believe in you. I'll do my best. Akiko would be so surprised if she knew you are on the radio! Plane 60 ready for take off. - The weather in Aomori? Discontinuity, getting stable. Visibility: Zero. Blizzards expected. Have they lost their mind? Flying under such conditions! Better confirm once more. - Yes. Engine sound! East! Engine sound! East! One twin-engine plane! Engine sound! East! One twin-engine plane! Engine Sounds! Ebbing away! Visibility: Zero. Passing through thick clouds. Latent clouds ahead. We have lost contact! Thick clouds above sea. Weather conditions unclear. Radio operator! Request guidance! Check and stay calm! Contact Hokkai Airfield. Tell them that the radio is operated by the female operator. She lacks experience. Ask for special support. Miss Matsumoto is on the radio post. - What, your friend? In plane 60? Guidance requested. - All right Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Plane 60 requesting guidance. What's the elevator pitch? Poor reactions! Trying the rudder! - Yes, sir! Yes, direction of Hokkai Airfield: 10 degrees! All right! We should be through! Good Luck, Female Radio Operator! Captain, message from Hokkai Airfield! Ten enemy aircraft on route to Hokkai Airfield! Take refuge at nearest air field! Hey, Kokuji! The nearest air field would be Towatari? Must be behind us? Direction: 250 Degrees. Distance 270 km. Not enough fuel to turn back! - Okay! Radio operator! - Yes? Contact Hokkai Airfield. "Must proceed to Hokkai Air Field." "Insufficient fuel to return." "Proceeding flight." - Yes, sir! "Enemy aircraft still in approach!" Enemy aircraft still in approach! Take refuge! Take refuge! "Friendly aircrafts on route." "Friendly aircrafts on route. Attacking enemy aircrafts." Miss Goto, you can't stay here! To the air-raid shelter! Mr Taniya, please go ahead first. - Hurry up! "Enemy aircraft over air field. Take refuge ..." We have lost contact with Hokkai Airfield! Call them! Keep calling! No reply from Hokkai Airfield. - Really? Plane 60 is calling Hokkai Airfield. Airfield in 135 degrees. Circling in 190 km distance. Seeking refuge. Low on fuel. Still no answer? No! Fine. Let's pass over the hills! Receiving answer. Clear for landing! Yes! Akiko! Yoshie! Are you hurt? Congratulations! You did a great job! Oh no ... I could only do it because of you and Sumiko ... Plane 60, took off at 13:00. Flying in excellent conditions. On route to Chijima Airfield. Congratulations! You put all your efforts together. You made a big step forward ... ... on your way as female radio operators. Congratulations! Three From The North THE END Subtitles by Totorochi (KG)
