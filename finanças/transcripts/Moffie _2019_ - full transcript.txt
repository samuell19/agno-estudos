SOUTH AFRICA, 1981 "The white minority govern the country through legislated racial segregation - Apartheid." "South Africa has begun military operations on its border with Soviet-backed Angola, to stop the spread of Communism." "All white boys over the age of 16 are conscripted for compulsory military service." Let's hope he comes back in one piece. "They are trained to defend the Apartheid regime." Van der Swart. Van der Swart! Get on the train. Come, come. We don't have all day. We arrive in Middelburg day after tomorrow. None of you get off before then. If you fuck with me, I'll fuck with you. You don't fuck around with the windows and you keep the compartment clean. If you want to piss, piss in the toilet. I don't want any fucking issues. Any questions? Good. Get the fuck in your compartment. What are you doing there? Stand up. Stand up! Stand up! Hey, kaffir! Stand up when a man talks to you. Stand up! Give me that bag. Hey, Mr. Kaffir, I have a little gift for you. Come! Come! Move it! Move it! Why are you still sitting here? The train arrived yesterday, scabs. Come here. Stay with me. Out! Out! Now! Now! Stand in a line. You, eyes forward. Move, you morons! Move! Move! Move, get on the fucking truck. Climb out, you cunts! Run! Get the fuck off. Take your fucking suitcase! Take off your clothes. You scabs are now the property of the South African government. Faster! Are you all fucking stupid? What the fuck do we have here? Did you think this was a fucking orgy, Pimpled Cunt? No, sir. Sergeant! Who the fuck are you calling sir? Were you hoping I'd pull your rope, Pimpled Cunt? Do I look like a fucking fag-ass to you? No, Sergeant. Take your hands away. Let's see. You! Don't look at his shrivelled dick, ass-fucker! Now, fuck off! Breathe in! Go. - Move! Move! - Breathe in. What the fuck are you still doing here? Fuck off! Forget everything you think you know. You are no longer someone. You are scabs. Bloody, puss-filled, useless scabs. And it's our job to turn you scabs into men. - Understood? - Yes, Lieutenant. - I can't hear you. - Yes, Lieutenant! One. Count together... One. One. I can't hear you. One. One. - Two. - Two. But I don't see anyone here who's going to make it, and become an officer. I hope I am wrong because South Africa is in deep shit. - Right, scabs? - Yes, Lieutenant! - Seven. - Seven. - Eight. - Eight. - Nine. - Nine. The black savages are on our doorstep. So close, we can smell them. But we will defend our borders... We will defend our freedom... Our women... Our children... - Right, scabs? - Yes, Lieutenant. - I can't hear you! - Yes, Lieutenant! Fifteen. - Sixteen. - Sixteen. - Seventeen. - Seventeen. Communism... Laziness... Faggotry... Kaffir sympathy... And any kind of undermining will not be tolerated. If you want to behave like the enemy, then I will treat you like the enemy. And how do we deal with the enemy, Sgt. Brand? We cure them, Lieutenant. And how do we do that? The only fucking way that works. We send the fuckers to hell. Hey, who the fuck is this? Take a look, Bester. Is this an English prick? One hundred percent. I don't know, the nose is a bit... No, man, that's a typical Englishman but he's real handsome. Excuse me. I don't know how you fucking Englishmen made it through primary school. The government is just wasting money on you English faggots. I know what I need to know. I know how his sister likes it. I know how to point a rifle at a kaffir's head... and shoot. You don't need school to teach you that, buddy. Right, can I just... Can I have it back, please? - Snyman? - Yes? Why don't you pick on someone your own size? Give it back. Fucking "commie". Look at him, he's enjoying it. Dumbass! - I'll be right back. - You get two minutes. Roos will help you. I am going to spend some time with Roos' mother. You sound like a kaffir, commie. - Why? Because I... - Sachs! Shut your fucking trap. Something on your mind, Sachs? Move aside. Fuck me. Suddenly he's got nothing to say. Come on. Now's your chance to speak. Okay, Sachs. I'll work on your attitude. Get the fuck out. The rest of you can join him. - I sweat fire - I sweat fire - I piss bullets - I piss bullets - I shit dynamite - I shit dynamite You wanted to come and take my country away I'm coming for you, my gun in hand You better pray so long, dear communist Because tomorrow I'm gonna spill your guts Let's thank Sachs for this opportunity. Thank you, Sachs. Come on. You've all done well. Time to rest. Here's some coffee and soup. Get in formation. Places... Get your cups out. Hurry up, aren't you thirsty? Yes, Sergeant. Are you tired? Yes, Sergeant. Something to say, Fourie? Nothing, Sergeant. What are you standing around for? Oudtshoorn is that way. Fuck off! What else? Fix that attitude. Do you have ants in your arse, Pimpled Cunt? - No, Sergeant. - So why the fuck are you shaking? I'm tired, Sergeant. I don't give a fuck if you're tired. You can't be tired, Pimpled Cunt. If you don't stand still, I'm going to burst every one of those yellow revolting boils on your fuck ugly face. Drop for twenty, Pimpled Cunt. How about you, pretty girl? You tired? No, Sergeant. What the fuck is this? My ear, Sergeant. - What did you say? - My ear, Sergeant. Don't get fucking smart with me. What's in your ear? A hole, Sergeant. And what do you put in that hole, Stassen? Nothing of late, Sergeant. See that tree? Yes, Sergeant. Fetch me a leaf from that tree. Well, fuck me, are you back yet? Run, you piece of shit. I can't hear you, Pimpled Cunt. - Thirteen... - Fuck me, thirteen? Make it fifty, Pimpled Cunt. That's fucking pathetic. Stand up straight. This is not a fucking party. No, Stassen. That's the wrong leaf. Get the right one. Off you go. - Do you feel sorry for your friends? - Yes, Sergeant. Take a good look at Pimpled Cunt. Take a good look at this inbred sack of bones. Are you all prepared to die for him? Yes, Sergeant. Are you all stupid? Pimpled Cunt will never make it to the border. He's too retarded. And too fucking slow. No, Pimpled Cunt will be baking cookies for the Generals until the army spits him out and sends him back home so that he can fuck his little sister again. Take a good look at Pimpled Cunt. This is what the army rejects. If you want to be like him, I'll make sure your time here will be fucking unbearable. And you will fucking suffer just like Pimpled Cunt is going to suffer. - Do we understand each other? - Yes, Sergeant! Who said you could puke on my fucking tarmac, troop? Put that puke back in your mouth. Sergeant... Question me again and I'll bite your fucking nose off and spit on you with your own snot. Put that puke back in your fucking mouth, troop. The rest of you are dismissed. Stassen and I will stay right here until he learns some manners. We all know that God does not make mistakes. He created all of us all in his image. So, when we catch two scabs doing the most disgusting, revolting acts right here, under our noses, it is our duty as soldiers, as men, to punish them accordingly. And that is what we are going to do today. The laws of our country are very clear. The laws of the Bible are very clear. So take a good look at these two godless animals. They are faggots and they don't belong with us. - What are they? - Faggots! - I can't hear you! - Faggots! - What? - Faggots! - I can't hear you! - Faggots! - What? - Faggots! - What? - Faggots! - What? - Faggots! What are their names? Baxter and something. Van der Walt saw them in the toilets. What did he see? Two pairs of feet in the same fucking cubicle. - They were busy kissing and stuff. - Holy shit. Van der Walt said the instructors took their pillows, filled them with gun parts and let everyone beat the shit out of them. And now? What happens now? I don't know. Ward 22. Jesus, Sachs, do you know them? No. - Are you sure? - Fuck off. Well, if you're crazy, you're crazy. I wonder if it's happened before. I wonder if it's happened to you before. Our dear God and Heavenly Father. Thank you for another day in this beautiful country that you gave us, Father. Father, we ask you to help us through this day. To fulfil our daily duty to the best of our abilities. Because, Lord, we all know why we are here. We are the Davids going to battle with Goliath. But David killed Goliath with a single stone, Lord. Because you guided his hand. Lord, give us the strength, the energy. Make us the Davids who exterminate Goliath. So that we can be rid, once and for all, of the communist threat on this beautiful country of ours. That's starting to look like a trench. I know it doesn't look like it, but I think it's going to rain tonight. If you climb out of these trenches before I say so, I'll fucking shoot you. I don't give a fuck if you drown. You stay in these trenches. - Understood? - Yes, Sergeant. Right. Have a good night, girls. See you tomorrow. Be careful, Van der Swart, your willy is going to fall off. I'm gonna screw till I pass out. Are we fucking playing or not? Sachs, the only girl you know is your pillow. Stop moaning, Van Der Merwe You're shit anyway. Yeah, she doesn't know me yet, but she will. She works at this little shop near my house. Blonde hair, blue eyes. Tits like fucking watermelons. Here it comes, Bester. Yours, Van Der Merwe! - What the fuck, Van Der Merwe! - You're throwing me off my game! You don't need to be thrown off. - What the fuck does that mean? - It means you're shit. Hey, sexy. Can I help you? I'll have a pack of cigarettes and a kiss, sexy. A ten pack or... a twenty pack? - The big one. - Oh, my goodness! Fuck this shit. - For fuck's sake, Van Der Merwe. - We're just kidding around. Where are you going? - Baxter! - Baxter, stop! Hey, put the gun down. Put down the fucking gun, now! He's out! Let's see how he looks after five rounds. Van der Swart, you're up. Fight! Come on. Fight! Van Der Merwe... Oscar fucked you up. Out! Out! Out! Spin that bottle. Come on, Stassen! Fuck. Dylan. It's just a game. Come on! Come on, Stassen! Fuck each other up! Fuck him up! Hit him! Hit him! What a joke. Come on, hit harder. - Do it! - Hit him! Fuck him up! Well done, Van der Swart. Stassen... Report to my office. - Cheers, boys. - Cheers, guys. Hey! What do you think you're doing? I saw you! Bullshit, I saw what you were doing! Sir? He was spying on you. Really? Come! Come here. I said, come here. Out of the way. I'm warning you, I'll beat you, do you hear me? - Is everything okay? - Yes, everything's fine. - What happened? - Come! - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure, woman. You shouldn't manhandle the boy like that. Stay out of it. Get in there! I caught this little pervert in the changing rooms. What happened? He was spying on one of the other boys in the shower. And then he began to play with himself. Shut your trap! It's disgusting. We can't allow this. There are children here. Where's the other boy? He's still in the changing room. Is your father here? Okay, let's find him and the other boy. Thank you, sir. We will handle it from here. No, I also want to talk to his father. Sir, we will handle it. Listen, I bring my sons here every summer. You get his father. I'll stay here and make sure the little faggot doesn't go anywhere. Where's your father? What's his name? Sit here, I'll be right back. - Are you the father of that boy? - What has happened? He was watching other boys in the showers. No, no. He just went to... I saw it, he was there. What are you talking about? He was just going to have a shower. There's the little pervert. Get him out of here! We don't want you people here! If you ever bring that faggot here again... Stassen must have fucked off. Can I help you, Van der Swart? He had a medical issue. He's been transferred. Drop it, Van der Swart. He's a piece of shit. I can't let him spoil the whole bunch. Something else you want to say to me? Right. Fucking sheep lifts. Let's go. Pick up your partner. Fucking pick him up! Fucking run! Turn around. Come back. Let's go! Let's go! Swap. Swap, hurry up! You're wasting my fucking time. Pick up your weapon. Let's move it. Turn around. Let's go! You girls are taking too long. Don't you dare, motherfucker! Stand up, Van der Swart! Attention. EIGHT MONTHS LATER Bang! Roos's entire foot, fucked up! - What? - You're all so brave. Especially you. We don't feel a thing! It's the army motto. Next week we go to the border. They've told us to write our wills before we leave. So, play your cards right and I'll leave you my entire stamp collection. Yes. My balls feel like lead balloons. Of my balls? Fuck, yes. The border...? Can't be that bad, can it? Van der Swart, did you hear about that guy, Hilton? The friend of that guy who shot his brains out. They let him come back from the madhouse. Come on, Van der Swart. What? He'll know where Stassen is. Come on! Let's bag those girls. Fuck it, Sachs. Don't forget to leave me something nice, men. Bessie... I'll take good care of your girlfriend. Yes, Sergeant. Sign. Faggot at the end. Shut up! Shut up... Shut up! Do you hear me? Shut up! Leave me alone. I can't think when you're constantly fucking crying. Shut up... Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I'll get you, you little fuckers. - Commander. - Not necessary. Welcome to the fun fair. My men are not particularly welcoming at first. So I suggest you settle in on the other side. Beautiful place, this. Tranquil. A man can have some serious dreams out here. The water tank is at the back. I almost forgot... The neighbours. We're gonna have some fun with them after dinner. If you're hungry, you can join us. A chance to meet the guys. Right, men. Take your stuff. Sleep over there. Snyman, search them. Van der Swart, Sachs... Hey. Stand in a line. Hey, in a line! Hands in the air. Come on! Show me your hands! Do it! Did you hear me? Hands in the air. Lift up! Sachs! Lower your fucking weapon. - Clean, Sergeant. - Right. Bester, catch this cookie in your mouth. Throw! You're wasting food. You must aim for the mouth, not the face. That's what his mother always says. Fifty bucks he's the first to die. What the fuck, Bester! We're just keeping ourselves busy. Tracker says it was a landmine. Two sets of tracks, heading southwest. Moving slowly, probably wounded. I feel nothing. - Not long to go, Sachs. - Not long. - What do you see? - Two men, there. - Where? - There, in front of us. - What do you see? - Nothing. Where's the radio? Enemy sighted. Possibly two... Contact! We're sitting ducks out here. - Right men, keep moving. - Stand up. Contact! Fucking listen to me. Get to that flank. Oscar, wait! What the fuck are you doing? Snyman, come back! Stay in your line. Stay in your line! They're waiting for us at the top. Snyman, Fourie... Follow me, stay low. Move, stay low. There's the fucker! Fuck! Snyman! Nick, no! Breathe, Snyman. Breathe, Snyman! Breathe! Fucking breathe! Breathe... Pout yourself a glass of wine. Come, we're celebrating. You've just come out of the army, buddy. Now you're a man. Have a drink with your father. Here, have a glass of wine. Let's drink to Nicholas. Of course. We're proud of you, son.
