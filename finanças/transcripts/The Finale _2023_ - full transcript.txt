Circle? I don't think I'll be able to do a circle. Might be more of an oval though. - Just have the kids sit on the damn floor, okay, Lindsey? - Yes ma'am. - (sighs) I gotta go. Don't forget to turn on the ghost light. - Turn on the ghost light, gotcha. (straining) All right, you have a good night- (door slams) Miss Medina. Sit on the floor. Alright. (door latch clicks) - Hey, boss. - Thanks for stopping by, Margo. I know you want to get out of here. - Oh, no problem. What's up? - My mother-in-law passed away. - Thomas, I'm so sorry. - Carol and the kids are flying out tonight. She wants me to join them tomorrow, but it's the first day of the clinic, so. - Are you kidding? Go, be with your family. - Are you sure? It'll be a week? - It's like year 20 for me in the clinic. I think I can handle it. Oh, my God. Were we ever this young, hmm? - Almost. - Oh, wow. - I found that when I was digging stuff up for a donor presentation. - Oh, wow. I'm just a baby. - Jeffrey's bold revision of "Blood Wedding." - Oh yeah, where I'm dead the whole time, and you were the, uh... - The fire breather. - Wah! Yeah. (laughing) Oh, my gosh, I think I blocked that out. - Yeah, block it out all you want, the past will fuck us all at some point. - [Margo] Hmm. - You sure you'll be okay without me here to kick things off? - Yes, and the staff has their marching orders. - If Bernard gives you shit- - Uh, then I'll tell the kids about the time he went up on his lines and pissed himself on stage. Bernie doesn't scare me, Thomas. Tell Carol I'm sorry for her loss. - I will. Call me if you need anything. (solemn music) (soft music) (door shuts) (stopper squeaks) (alcohol glugging) (Thomas swallowing) Fucking theater camp. Hmm. (Thomas inhales and exhales) - (laughs) You FaceTimed. How cute. - Told Carol I have camp. Told camp I have to fly to the funeral. We have a week all to ourselves. - Then get your ass over here, old man. - Get your ass over here. I booked a suite at the Adolphus. All week. - You're a goddamn rockstar. - Mm-hmm, mm, mm. - I'll see you in a few- - Touching your boobies. (box lid thudding) (lights buzzing) (ominous music) Still here. (eerie music) (lights buzzing) Thanks. (Thomas sighing) Come on, man! (eerie music) Wonderful. (Thomas inhales and exhales) I hate this fucking place. (ominous music) ♪ I'm gonna get my dick sucked ♪ (ominous music) (eerie music) (keys clanging) Oh. Ah! (hands thudding) (ominous music) Camp doesn't start until tomorrow, kid. That means stupid camp pranks don't start until tomorrow. You think you're funny? (ominous music) I will kick you the hell out of here and make sure you don't work anywhere. Let me tell you something, kid. The decisions you make right now will haunt you for the rest of your fucking life. (ominous music) It's get back to Rico. Ah! - Hey. - Jesus! How the hell did you get in here? - Stage door is open. - (sighs) Let's get outta here. - [Amber] Ow, hey, ow, ow, ow. Watch your shoes, watch your shoes. Hey, what's wrong? - Just an idiot kid playing a prank. Come on. (Amber chuckles) - Pranks were my favorite part when I was a camper here. (Thomas laughing) - Oh, Vine-y hiney. Every year these kids get to be bigger pricks. - Well, you don't have to worry about that for a whole week. (ominous music) (knife plunging in) (Amber screams) Ah. (blood splattering) - [Child] Can we go? - Yes, baby, we can go to the park just as soon as we send your sister off. Sagan, would it kill you just to wear a little make-up? - I'm going to camp to dance, not to look pretty for pictures. - There are hundreds of girls just as talented as you are. Sometimes you have to do a little something extra. - Can we not talk about this right now? - Promise me you'll take this seriously. This clinic is... - A direct pipeline to college programs, New York, LA. Yeah, I know. - It changed your sister's life. They noticed her because she worked hard and because- - She's noticeable. - The future is now, Sagan. - That doesn't really make sense. - The future is now. (soft music) - Good morning, everybody. Hundreds auditioned for these spots, but only the eight of you were selected. So, congratulations and welcome to Stage Left. (all clapping) Just being here gives you a headstart on performers your age from all over the country. - Ooh! (claps) - The next two weeks will be grueling because the business of creation is grueling. Mornings will be dedicated to classes. Afternoons and evenings, you'll rehearse the new musical "What Mary Saw." (group murmuring) Guiding you on this journey will be some of the most talented people you'll ever meet. Broadway legend, Mr. Charles McMasters, dance teacher and choreographer. (all clapping) - People say, "Dance like nobody's watching." I say if you're dancing, I'm watching and I'm probably not pleased. (all laughing) - Former Stage Left camper and queen of bite and smile commercials, Ms. Stephanie Briggs joins us as an instructor for the first time. She's your voice coach, musical director and constant reminder that I'm old. - This place made me what I am. It taught me how the business works and I promise I'll do the same for all of you. And you can call me Steph. - Lindsey Carr is your stage manager and Den Mother at the house. If you are sick or running late, she's the person to call. And finally, fresh off his star turn as Stanley Kowalski in "Streetcar" at the Cleveland Playhouse and his stint as Mr. Kane on "Wolves of Westlake," please welcome two-time Drama Desk Award nominee, Mr. Bernard Hewson. (all clapping) - Thank you Margo for the lovely intro. You kids have fun, do your little musical, but when you work with me, be ready to fucking act. - Fantastic. - They look younger every year we do this. - Bernard, that was your one free pass. You pull that crap again, I'll rip your face off. There's coffee and muffins. Have a great first day everyone. - Guess she wasn't a fan of Mr. Kane of "Wolves of Westlake." Remind me, did you die in the first three minutes of the episode or did you make it past the opening credits? - Fuck you, Charles. (solemn music) You got something you want to add? - It's good to see you Mr. Hewson. - Bernard, kid. You're not a camper anymore. - It's good to see you, Bernard. (solemn music) - So, why don't you start us off, um... Tim. - I'm Tim, starts with tenor. - [Lindsey] Great. - I'm Lila, starts with lascivious. - I'm Marcus, starts with magic. - How? - I'm really good at disappearing. - I'm Sagan, starts with separate. - [Lindsey] Okay. - I'm Kylie, starts with klepto. - [Tim] Bullshit! - No, it's true. I steal all the boys' hearts, and their clothes. (group laughs) I steal a lot of clothes. (group laughs) - [Lindsey] Huh. - I'm Austin, starts with Aurelius. - [Tim] What the hell does that mean? - [Sagan] It means he's a pretentious prick. - [Lila] Or, he's stoic and philosophical. - You're both right. - Rachael, stands for rock-hard abs. - [Austin] Prove it. - [Lila] Yeah. - She ain't lying, y'all. - [Lesley] Okay. - I'm Nixon, starts with not gonna play this stupid ass game. - Okay. Uh, hm. Okay, so, um, wants to lead us in a physical warm-up before class starts? - I'll do it. Uh, stand up. You too, Mr. Kickass. (soft music) Alright, okay. [All] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three. (Margo sighs) (stopper pops) (alcohol glugging) (bottle thudding) Oh. Fuck you and your metabolism.

(group laughing) I know this stuff is boring, but when you're doing eight shows a week on Broadway... Excuse me for a second. - Oh, my God, I can't believe we're (indistinct). (group whispering indistinctly) - Do you need something Mr. Hew- Bernard? - Always good to get a sense of who you're dealing with before they come into the room. - [Student] Yeah, I've actually like, I've done a lot (indistinct) - Dream come true. - Who's melancholy Dane? - What? - Kid in all black, looks like he's over it. - Nixon. - Maybe he'll be the one real actor in the bunch. (Stephanie sighs) - People at this camp might tell you you don't have what it takes to be real actors. Don't listen. You act all the time when you talk to teachers, bosses, even friends. Every day is a dress rehearsal and every day you're succeeding as an actor. - Five, six, seven, eight. One, two and three. Four and five, six and seven, eight. And one, two and three, four and foot. - Stop. (sighs) What was that, Sagan? - A pas de bourree. - Really? Because it looked like pas de boushit. Go! - Do it again? - No, go. Leave the room, all of you, go. Go pee or give each other a hand job. Anything that takes two minutes. I can't look at any of you anymore. (shoes squeaking) (bags rustling) - It's pretty hard on 'em for the first day. - You of all people should know the ones with actual talent require the most verbal abuse. - I do. - We missed you last night. We always go to the bar the night before camp starts. Too big for our little traditions now? - I had things to do. And technically camp starts tomorrow for me. - What are you doing here? - Just wanted to watch you work. - Bullshit. - Don't believe everything you hear, Charles. - I know you, Bernie. I don't need to hear anything from anyone. (Bernard shuffling) (footsteps thudding) (door creaking) (footsteps thudding) - Sorry, kid, no smoking. - I'm 18. - Camp rules. - Charles smokes in the room. - Yeah, and we let him 'cause we're all secretly hoping it'll kill him soon. (Sagan chuckles) Sagan, right? - Yeah. - Well, if you're sing and act half as well as you dance, you just might be a triple-threat, Sagan. See you tomorrow. (Margo snorting) (chips crunching) - Stupid. (door creaking) (packet crackling) - Hello? (packet crackling) (eye glasses clicking) You guys know you're not supposed to be up here. (door slams) (ominous music) (Margo sighs) (eerie music) (ominous music) (ominous music continues) The studio's only for class. (ominous music) (door squeaking) (door slams) God. Good prank, you got me. Now get back to lunch. (door rattling) Not funny. Open the fucking door. (ominous music) (eerie music) (Margo shrieks) - Lindsey, open the door! (banging on door) Hey, open this door! (ominous music) (door latch clicking) Fucking kids! (footsteps tapping) - I don't know (indistinct). - Yeah so in my freshman year- - Lindsey, I need you. - For what? - Strike the downstairs studio. And tell the children, while we all cherish the long tradition of camp pranks here at Stage Left, they really need to stay out of there unless they're in class. - What happened? - Just do what I fucking ask you to do, Lindsey. - Yes, ma'am. Just eat. - You know they have food for us. - Not hungry. - Do you practice that brooding look in the mirror or do you have a director like give you notes? - Screw you. - Relax. Hey. We have 20 minutes. Wanna get high? (soft music) I think this is it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, come on, come on. Look at this, oh, my gosh. Look at this. - What? Look at this place, this is crazy. Oh, that's nice. (chuckles) (Nixon straining) Hm. (soft music) - How did you find out about this place? - My sister came to camp like forever ago. She's like 25 and killing it in LA. - Really? - Yeah, must be blowing all the the right people, I guess. (Sagan chuckling) (Nixon laughs) I'm kidding. She's really talented and beautiful and all that. - Is that what you wanna do. - Today I want to be a better dancer. - What did separate mean in that stupid icebreaker? - (sighs) My mom is constantly telling me how amazing my big sister is while doting on my baby brother. Separate from what came before me and what came after me, I guess. Oh, (laughing) I sound ridiculous. - That's why you're here? Your sister did it, so your mom made you? - Yep. Well, what about you? You don't seem like the musical theater type. - My family said I should spend time with positive people. - Okay, how's that working out? (Nixon laughs) - Seems all right so far. - Yeah? (gentle music) - Yeah. - Whoa, hold on a second. Just, just hold on. - Oh, oh, God, shit, I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. - No, just, let's just take it slow and maybe wait until there's not like rocks and sticks digging in my ass. We should head back. - I a... I am so sorry. I fucked this up, and you're like the only cool person here. So I- (gentle music) - Relax. Okay? I just don't wanna be late to rehearsal. (gentle music) - Lights up. Mary stumbles in and crosses to the students. - Can you help me? Please! - Alex breaks from the group.

Hit the damn note. - Tim, dear, maybe when you learn to count without moving your lips, you can give other performers notes. - [Austin] Sorry, Steph. - Not your fault. The song isn't in your range. The part isn't in your range. It's our fault. - Steph, fix it. - How? - Do you want me to handle this? - I got it. Oh. Austin, you're working your ass off. We screwed this up. Luckily we caught it early enough. Now all the roles are great so you're just gonna play a different great role that's actually in your vocal range. - I'm sorry. - You have all the talent in the world. Don't let this phase you. - Not so fast, Tim. - [Margo] Nixon. - Yes, Miss Medina. - You're going to play Alex. - No, I can't hit those notes. - [Margo] Cut the shit. Come sing the song.

(ominous music) - What'd you tell Charles, Stephanie? - Nothing. (tense music) - You sure? - Yes. I didn't blame you. I never, I haven't told anyone anything ever. I promise. (tense music) - Okay, then. Have a good night. (tense music) (tense music continues) (zipper rasping) (door latch clicking) - Okay. You, uh, wanna walk out together? - No, you go ahead, Lindsey. I've still got a couple of things I wanna do. - You sure? - Yeah. You just go house-mom the hell out of those kids. - (chuckles) Okay.

You got that? Stand up. (group shuffling) (chair thudding) You, Sarah, right? - Sagan. - You play Mary in the show? - Yes. - So you're the lead? - I, it's an ensemble piece. - If you're the lead, own it. If not, (scoffs) sit down. - I'm the lead. - Good. Get up here. Who's Mary? - She is a high school kid whose best friend's father is a killer. - But? - [Sagan] Nobody believes her. - You can't know that going in though. You have to believe you can convince them, or else why the hell am I watching? You. - Lila. - Yeah. Who you play in this dog and pony show? - Her best friend, Este. - Oh, hey, look at that. It's almost like I paid attention when they cast this thing. (Tim laughs) (group shuffling) (Tim shuffling) Okay, Mary. Convince your friend, Este, that she's in danger. She has to leave with you. - But I'm not off book. - You need a writer to tell you how to convince someone of something. Just do it. - You have to get out of here. - Why? - Your dad is dangerous! - [Lila] How do you know? - I've seen it in his eyes. (Lila laughing) - [Bernard] Good, Lila. - You have to leave! - Yelling isn't working, is it? Try a different tactic. Do you love her? - (scoffs) Maybe. I-I don't know. - She's your best friend. Do you love your best friend? - Yes. - Go. (soft tense music) (soft tense music continues) - Este, come with me, please. - [Lila] Why? - If we stay here, I might lose you. Come with me. - We'll be safe? - Yes. Yes. And we'll be together. (tense music swelling) - Bernard, a word please. (footsteps tapping) - I don't tell you how to run rehearsal so you don't tell me how to run class. You call on Bernard Hewson, you get Bernard Hewson. - You sound like a fucking idiot when you talk like that. And that's not what this is about. Have you seen Charles? - No. Why? - He hasn't shown up. - Isn't it just my class today? Sure he'll be there at rehearsal. - We had a meeting about the show this morning and he didn't come. It's not like him. - He has been talking about the bar a lot. Maybe the old man got hammered and overslept. - [Margot] Always helpful, Bernie. - You know, you're getting uptight, Margo. You used to be fun. I'm sure Charles is fine. (camera clicking) (soft music) - Oh, that might be the sexiest thing I've ever seen in my whole life. - Oh, wait till my back gives out and I get stuck down here. That's when it really gets hot. - [Reyes] Good to see you, Viv. - Oh, nice to see you both still dressed like you're in the movies. - Oh, wear the same thing every day, one less thing to worry about. - I got a fun one for you, Ronnie. Hey, stop lurking, Nick, you're freaking the kid out. - Nah, the kid's a pro. Right, Mustache? - Uh. - Solid answer. Who is he? - Charles McMasters, mid 50s. - Damn, he's in great shape. - He is. He's also been dead since between 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM and whatever happened to him didn't happen here in the apartment. - [Rizzo] What do you mean? - Look at the legs. - Ooh, killer sliced his Achilles and let him think he could still get away. Looks like Mr. McMasters dragged himself across a sidewalk or a street before the killer finished the job. - I have work to do, but I think you nailed it. - So, how'd we get here, Vivien? - Officer Andrews, why don't you tell Detectives Reyes and Rizzo how you stumbled upon your first murder scene. - Uh, neighbor called about loud music. Nobody answered when I knocked, so I got the manager to let me in. That's when I found the body. A song was blaring at top volume from the compact discplayer "When you're a jet, you're a jet all the way." Those lyrics will haunt me until the day that I die. That and the um, the hands, you know? Why, uh, mm, why are the hands like that? - Those are jazz hands. - Uh, why, what? - Well, he's a dancer. - Like a stripper? - Musical theater, Rizzo. Killer wanted him to hit a pose after a big number one last time. Ah. (introspective music) (car doors slamming) - Whoever did this made no effort to hide the body. Then turned up the music so someone would call the cops and find it. - I don't think killers did this kind of cat and mouse shit with cops until they saw it on TV. - You love TV. - Why do you think I became a cop? (Rizzo laughing) - So this guy's got no family. No one in the apartment knows who he is. Where does he work? - Theater clinic. - What the fuck is a theater clinic? - I don't know. Let's go find out. - You're a dick. - Coffee? - Sarah? What was that shit? - Well, Sagan, I didn't want the other children to know that I think you're special. - Special? - Yeah. And in class today you proved it. - We're all eating outside. Got some food for you. - You kids enjoy your lunch. - [Student] Oh, my God, what's she doing? - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. - Alright. - Hold on. - Let's see if I can do it. - Alright. - Oh, look at that. - Ugh. Kids. - Relax, Rizzo. They're probably really sweet and full of energy. - [Rizzo] Yeah, look at 'em though. Worms and fleas and shit. - [Reyes] That's dog's, Rizzo. - [Rizzo] Right. - So you and Taylor really don't want any? - Sometimes she says stuff that makes me think she does. Deep down she knows I'd be a shitty father. - No, you wouldn't. - What about you and Robert? You ever regret not having any? - I don't waste time thinking about things that didn't happen. Let's see what we can find. - Hey, kids. Is there a grownup we could talk to? - Jesus, Rizzo, they're not five. Please excuse my partner. He's an idiot. Can anyone tell us where the camp director is? - Lindsey, some people are looking for Miss Medina. (Margot sobbing) - I knew something was wrong when he didn't, he didn't come to the meeting. He, he never misses meetings. - Can you think of anyone who might have had a problem with Charles? - Everybody loved him. - Anyone he owed money, a girlfriend or boyfriend he might have pissed off? - No, Charles never talked about money problems and he stopped dating years ago. He said no one could handle his immense gift. (laughs) Sorry, I shouldn't laugh. - No, it's okay. Everyone loves a well-timed dick joke. - Any issue with the kids? Like did he loathe the sight of them? - Of course not. - I noticed that's not your name on the door. - Oh. Well, our artistic director's out of town and I am running things in his absence. His office is a lot nicer, so I'm in here. - One more question. Does this camp offer any scholarships? - Uh. Yeah, but Charles didn't have anything to do with that. - Oh, no, I have a very talented nephew. He's a good kid, loves theater. - Oh, uh, well, I, I, I'd be happy to give you the information. - That would be great. - Also, could we have that folder labeled Staff and Students. (pensive music) - I'm canceling tonight's rehearsal. This theater, this camp, this industry lost one of its great lights. Spend tonight celebrating life and enjoying one another. That's what mattered most to Charles. We'll resume tomorrow as normal. Charles wouldn't want the show to suffer on his account. (pensive music) - Let's, uh, get back to the house, kids. - [Student] What do you think happened? - [Student] I don't know. (students chattering indistinctly) - Hey, Lindsey, I need a minute with Sagan. Had a few notes about her work in class today. - Well, don't keep her too long. I'm gonna order pizza to cheer us up. (eerie music) - Oh, it's a shame to miss rehearsal after the discoveries you made in class. - Yeah. - I tell you what, I'm gonna work your monologue with you. - Right now? - You don't wanna miss pizza. And we don't want others popping in, ruining the work. - You think you could sneak outta the house about midnight? - Guess you'll have to wait and see. (soft music) - Wait and see. - It gets worse. It's been a month since Spencer's missing and I'm in my bed and I get a phone call. Spencer's number. I pick it up, "Dude, where are you? Everybody's freaking out." On the other end, it's silence, then screams and then silence again. No one's ever seen or heard from Spencer since. - Hey, ya. (students scream) Sorry. Look, I just wanted to remind you to clean up after, alright? So have fun. Do what you want- - [All] As long as the house stays clean. - That's it. Good night. (Lindsey laughing) - Can we do something not terrifying now? - Let's do something fun. - Ooh, Marry, Fuck, Kill, but characters from musicals. (students murmuring) - Austin and "Grease." - Oh, easy. Um, marry Danny. Fuck Kenickie. Kill Frenchie. - What? Frenchie's the best. - [Austin] Mm-mm. - I pick Nixon and "Les Miz." - I don't know what that is. - Bullshit. - Sorry, man. Not well-versed in this stuff. - Again, bullshit. - Man, do you ever shut the fuck up? - You all think to be pulled that voice out of his ass last night? - What are you talking about? - Age 10. "Les Miserables" Regional Tour, "Nixon Grace is thrilled to be playing the role of Gavroche, the lovable street urchin." - What? - He was a child star. Multiple tours. Age 13, "Beauty and the Beast." Age 14, "Big River." And just two short years ago at 16, "Nixon Grace is overjoyed to be playing Jack in 'Into the Woods.'" - No effing way. - So, what turned the happy-go-lucky musical theater whiz into the James Dean wannabe we see before us? - Fuck off. - Oh, right. The baker and the baker's wife went to a hotel after the matinee and didn't make it back for the evening show. - Whoa. Wait, what does that mean? (poignant music) - When we were on tour in Chicago, two of my castmates died in their hotel rooms. Nobody knows what happened to them. They were my friends. After that, I wasn't real happy-go-lucky anymore. Satisfied? - What the hell is your problem? - I, I, I... What? He, he broods and, and makes fun of us for, for loving musicals when he's a goddamn pro at it. - Pizza in my room for anyone who still wants to hang. Not you, Tim. - Make sure you clean up, asshole. - You guys are dicks. (Lindsey mumbling) - [Lindsey] Oh. - You picked the wrong motherfucker, motherfuckers. (clothing shuffling) (Tim scoffing) My name's Tim. Starts with time to pull a prank and scare the shit outta you stupid little motherfuckers.

And if we don't, is it gonna like stick with us forever? - You can ask me about the "Into the Woods" thing if you want, 'cause it kind of feels like you're asking me about the "Into the Woods" thing. - That was in the past.

(footsteps thudding) - It's beginning to think you didn't care about your craft. - What are we doing here, Mr. Hewson? - Working the opening monologue. - That's it? - If that's all you want. Sit down, pour yourself a drink. - No I'm good. - Relax. It's sparkling grape juice. And it's a part of the exercise. (liquid glugging) (Bernard slurping) So, the tendency with a big opening monologue is to go guns blazing outta the gate. That's death, leaves you know where to go. With something like this, you wanna invite the audience in like they're your closest friends. - Okay. - So try it like you're sitting at a table in a nice restaurant talking to someone you trust. You know the lines? - For this part. - Good. Now remember, you're just talking with a friend in a public place. - Listen to me. You have to listen to me. (Sagan slurping) I know things. Things that nobody else knows. - It's good. It's simple. - Everyone thinks they're special. I get it, but I actually am. Not better. Different. It's like a... It's, it's like, um- - You need a line, I got a copy of the scrip I think. - Ah, something's wrong. - Everything is fine. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Relax. Everything's fine. - Get off of me.

I looked for you everywhere and I finally found you out by the theater. So I thought you must have been sleepwalking, so I brought you back here. - Okay, and there was no one else there. - Uh, no, no one. The theater was all dark. - Okay, but I'm in my pajamas. Did you undress me or? - (gibbering) No. Jesus, no, I, I brought you back here, I put you in your bed in your clothes, and I only stayed here in case that you started sleepwalking again. You, you must have gotten up and changed in the middle of the night. - You swear you didn't touch me or. - I'm not an asshole, Sagan. - I, I, I don't remember how it happened, um, was lost time or something. I, I remember a, a, a nightmare about Steph. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh. - Sagan! - Say- - Miss Medina. - Whoa, don't dress for the job you have, dress for the job you want. So, hobo? - Just, Sagan, what's wrong? - Have you seen Steph? - She'll be here soon. - No, she won't. Something terrible happened to her. - [Margot] Sagan. - Good morning, everyone. - You're not safe. Something bad is gonna happen to you. - Nothing's wrong. - Someone is trying to kill you. (Sagan panting) (Stephanie laughing) - You got me. That was good. In my day we just toilet-papered Mr. Graham's office. You all have taken the pranks to the next level. Like the show, "Oh, your dad's a killer, argh." - We're gonna go back to the house. - Real good stuff, you two. (Stephanie laughing) (Margot sighs) - What? - Are you wearing makeup, Bernard? - Concealer. I'm nothing if not vain. (light music) - I wanna help, but I don't understand. - Something happened last night and I don't fucking remember. (knocking on door) - Hey, have you guys seen Tim? (Knocking on door) Tim? Come on, we're gonna be late. (light music) - Maybe Marcus disappeared him into the nightmare place. - Don't even joke about that. - What's up? - Tim won't come out of his room. - No one told you? - Told us what? - (sighs) Of course they didn't. Leave everything to the stage manager. Um, so Tim went home this morning. Yeah, I got a text. Apparently he felt like he didn't belong here. Car picked him up from the theater and took him to the airport this morning. - Hmm. - Oh, my God. - (panting) Who's gonna play Chaz? The show's ruined, you guys. (panting) - Breathe. Um, imagine that there's a golden string running from the top of your head all the way through your spine. Breathe. - No, no, no. The show's gonna be fine. Miss Medina will figure it out. (chuckling) - This is kind of our fault. - He's the asshole, not us. - Totally. So let's go to class. Sagan, Marcus, Nixon, let's roll. - Are you coming to class? - No, I need to like sleep or something. - I can stay with you. - And do what? Not believe anything I have to say? - Sagan. - Go. (emotional music) (emotional music continues) (emotional music continues) (emotional music continues) (emotional music continues) - Sagan, honey, it's Lindsey. Can I come in? - Uh, sure. - I heard you weren't feeling well. I brought you something. - Oh, no, you didn't have to do that. - Nonsense. I take care of my actors. Now, do you need to go to the doctor? - No, it's just a headache. I'll survive. - Mm-mm. I know how that can be. You take these. Take it. Good. Now you text me if you need anything. Ugh. I will bring you some lunch a little later, okay? (Lindsey chuckles) (pills clattering) (soft tense music) - Apparently this one did a short film that fared very well at a festival in Madrid. - Hm, cop boss is gonna be so pissed. - Why? - Cop boss doesn't need a reason to be pissed. Cop boss is crazy. - Oh, yeah. How about I set your hair on fire, Jimmy? How'd that be? Fucking hell. So let me guess. You two finally finished eating your tacos and cannolis and now you want to talk business. It's that theater camp thing. - It's, uh- - My nephew says you're busting chops, Rizzo. - [Rizzo] Nephew? - My sister's kid. Andrews. - Mustache. - Right, yeah, good kid. - Is he? Or is he a fucking idiot? Never tell with these young people. - Captain, the way Charles McMasters' body was found, it seemed like an inside joke. It was like someone knew his background and his lifestyle. - You think somebody at this Stage Left did it? - We wanna talk to the campers. That's why we came to see you. - Of course that's what you want. Just go in half-cocked and then somehow get lucky, like you always fucking do. And then you leave it to the old man to clean up your damn mess. - What are you talking about? - Kids, Rizzo. You question them without something airtight, it'll be a nightmare when their parents catch wind of it. Fucking lawsuits, the mayor's dick in a twist, all that. No way. - I know, right? Mr. Kane. - Says Hewson. - [Reyes and Saxon] "Wolves of Westlake." - He was torn apart. - Yeah, one of the best death scenes ever. You question him yet? - [Reyes] He's on the list. - Why would a guy with his career murder someone and then set it up so the cops would be on his trail? - I'll tell you why. You ever acted before, Rizzo? - No. - I have. Eighth grade. Tin Man in the "Wizard of Oz." (audience clapping) Every night they cheered. Well, they cheered so much. "Hey, Ma, I think I want to sing and dance." "Knock it off, Tommy, and don't let your old man hear you say that." "But it's, it's my dream, Ma. Ma? Ma?" (audience cheering) - Captain? - You crave the spotlight every minute of every day. You need people to watch you. Yeah, to validate you, to fill whatever void you have in your soul. Guy like this wouldn't just kill a man and let his work go uncredited. You talk to him. If there's something there, I'll let you go back to the camp and talk to the kids. - Thanks, Captain. (Saxon sighing) - If I only had a heart. Am I right, Rizzo? If I only had a heart. (knocking on door) - [Bernard] Jesus Christ, about time. - Bernard Hewson? - Yeah. - Damn, you're in great shape. You have a personal trainer or? - I just watched what I, I'm sorry. Are you from the hotel? They said they were gonna send up towels. - Detectives Reyes and Rizzo. We're here to ask you some questions about Charles McMasters. It won't take long. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, uh, have a seat. Sorry about that. I was jumping in the shower when you knocked. - I have to say, I am a huge fan. You know that scene where the Alpha gets you in the throat and the Beta gets you in the gut, that look on your face, I felt like I was there. - Thank you. You know, you do these little roles, you hope people like 'em. It's really nice to hear. - Did you like Charles McMasters, Mr. Hewson? - I loved Charles, everyone did. Once they got to know him. - The theater put you up in this room? - They did. I split my time between New York and LA but I always come back to do the clinic if I can. I feel it's my responsibility to shape the next generation of artists. - That's lovely. Do you know anyone who might have had it in for Charles? - Like I said, everyone loved him. - Mm. I guess we have to go talk to the kids. - Oh, God. - Mr. Hewson? - I didn't think... Charles was very good at hiding it, but he used to have a cocaine problem. - Really? - A couple of years ago, I found him in the bathroom in the bar. His nose was bleeding. It's pretty clear what was going on. - Did you tell the camp director? - No. It would've ruined his life. Charles loved those kids and he was so good for them and he said he was gonna get help and, and he did. I didn't think. If he went back on it, oh, God. Maybe if I would've said something back then he would. He would-(crying) - It's okay. People make mistakes all the time trying to protect their friends. (Bernard crying) - I'm sorry. I'm not... (Bernard sobbing) - It's no problem. Thank you for your time. We'll let you know if we need anything else. (Bernard sobbing) (Bernard sniffles) (door slams) - See it? - Yep. Peaking out from under his towel. - What do you think? - Well, there's a million different ways to hurt your leg, but it could be something. - What do you wanna do? - Dig up some dirt and track down all his known associates from the magical world of professional theater. (Rizzo laughing) (door creaking) (birds chirping softly) (door creaking) Mr. Crane, in 2000- - You, you can call me Alistair. At least until the makeup is fully on. - Okay, Alistair. And 10 years ago you appeared in a play with Bernard Hewson. - "And Baby Makes Nine." - Dreadful. - This play closed only after three weeks, despite full houses and a lot of talk that it would be the next "Drowsy Chaperone." - (laughs) Please. As if there could ever be another "Drowsy Chaperone." (Alistair laughing) - Why the early closing Alistair? - What can I say? Some plays just don't work. - Oh, tell me about it. I have a nephew who was in one about a sad boy who sings about being sad. Terrible. - That wasn't the case though, was it? This particular show was shut down due to anonymous complaints filed about Bernard Hewson. Who filed the complaints? - Well, clearly if they're anonymous. - Well, we think you filed them, Alistair. - [Rizzo] We think you filed them and that Hewson figured out it was you. - And your career never quite got back on track after "Baby Makes Twelve." - "Nine." 12 Children would be absurd. - Why did you file the complaints? - It wasn't me. - Oh, come on, Al. Why keep up the charade? I mean, the damage is already done. - Were you jealous of him? I've heard actors can get jealous when another actor is better than they are. - Better? That hack? - [Announcer] Places people, places. - If it wasn't for his abdomen and his ability to snow every producer he's ever met, he'd be lucky to play the dancing idiot in the community theater holiday play. - You complained. He found out it was you and he used his connections to shut you down. So just tell us what the complaint is about., Alistair. - [Announcer] Places. (hanger clicking) Alistair. - [Announcer] Mr. Crane, places. - The way he treated the young woman playing the twins. It was... When he found out I was the one, he ruined me. (sighs) But I told him if he just left her alone, just let her go her own way, I'd never say anything else. - What did he do, Alistair? - [Announcer] Mr. Crane, places. - Bernard Hewson preys on youth like a vampire and comports himself like the goddamn Devil. (actors chattering indistinctly) - Preys on youth? Charles McMasters was in his 50s. - Well, maybe Charles knew something and was going to tell someone. It's a start. We should keep digging.

Hey, I'm sorry I freaked out on you. You were right and I must have been sleepwalking or had a migraine that made me go crazy. - Hey, I'm just glad that you're okay. - Do you wanna sleep over tonight? - Are you sure? - Absolutely. - Hey, where you going? - [Sagan] None of your business. - She's going to shower and probably put on something hot for you. - Really? - Clueless. - [Student] So what are we doing tonight? (students chattering indistinctly) - Oh, my God. - Yeah. It's the stupidest thing in the world. - Yeah, that sounds, - - Can you tell them, Rach? - Oh, we have been rehearsing our asses off like professionals, so we deserve a night of partying like professionals. (students cheering) - Whoa, I thought you were supposed to be a good little musical theater kid. - These stereotypes aren't really benefiting anyone, Sagan. - You're right, I apologize. - I'm in. - Me too.

I'll draw you up a map, but make sure that Lindsey doesn't catch you all sneaking out. - She doesn't care what we do. - [All] As long as the house stays clean. - The pie's legit, isn't it? - Damn good. Last year's show is described as "a true comment on the world we live in." "Teens Pack Adult Punch in New Musical." - Sure it's very powerful. - Well, they shouldn't criticize kids at a camp like that. - Why not? They wanna be stars, don't they? - It's educational. They should have the opportunity to fail and fuck up without being judged for it. - Hmm. - Do you hear that? Do you fucking hear that? (Lila screaming) (Lila laughing) - Now I do. - Listen. Listen. This is it. TV, books, movies. They're all existing at the same time. We're tuning into their universes. We're, and, and we're catching these, these, these glimpses of them. (laughing) - So like the witch detective in the comic that I'm reading right now, she's like actually out there like solving cases with like magic and shit. - Absolutely. - And like when I read it, it's just me like catching a glimpse of like her actual life. - [Marcus] Yes. (Kylie gasps) - I was a witch detective once. - Yeah, you were. - Oh, my God, Lila, stop. (students laughing) (knocking on door) - Come in. (romantic music) Hey. - Wow. (romantic music continues) (door creaking) (door slams) - When we were kids, there wasn't that kind of pressure. No adults even knew what we were doing. - Summer break, get on my bike in the morning, come back at dinner. Wouldn't check in at all. - Now parents want to know what kids are doing all the time. It isn't fair to them. - It's for their own safety though, right? - Rizzo, come on. You know damn well that if a fucking crazy person wants to do harm, it doesn't make a difference if a kid's parents know where she is. (light music) - My God, I have to pee so bad. - It's like 40 trees over there. - Oh, gross. I'm not gonna pee outside. I'm gonna go to the house. - Dude, that'll take like three hours, or like two minutes. I don't know. I have like no concept of time right now. - Take the map. Does anybody have the map? - I already have the map. - Yeah, you do. - Well played, Lila. - I think I got something. - Oh, make it bigger. I think I need a new prescription. - "Assault charges were dropped, and Mr. Hewson will return to the production." That's 15 years ago. - According to another article, that was his break out role. Nothing else about the girl. - I need Vivien. - It's late. - You know what to do. - Norma? Can we get three milkshakes, two vanilla, one strawberry? - Ooh, I like it when you talk dirty, Detective. (laughs) - Hey, buddy, I need a favor. (funky music) - Light as a feather, stiff as a board. Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

Still working, but judging from the angle and depth of the cuts to the throat and chest, it seems poor Charles got it while on his back. - So the killer caught him while he was dragging himself. - Then threw him on his back, stood over him, sliced his throat with something like a box cutter, stabbed him multiple times in the chest. Cuts are deep, even for someone standing over the victim. Killer was strong. - [Rizzo] Anything else? - A lot of material imbedded in the legs. I mean most of it you'd expect if he's dragging himself across concrete, but one thing stood out. - What? - Hmm, black paint. Not the kind you'd find on a road or a parking lot or even in a house. - The kind you find in the theater? - Keeps the blackouts real black. And that, my pretties, is all I have. Good night. Next time, drive your asses out to see me. - Fucking Hewson. Let's go. - Reyes, we don't have anything that'll hold up. Vivien said the killer was strong, not that some insanely cut dude did it. - The paint. He died at the theater. - He was a dancer who worked there. Maybe he did that cool thing where they slide across the stage on their knees. Maybe he helped build sets. Who knows? - You know what? You're right, I don't know if Bernard Hewson killed Charles McMasters, but I am positive that he is the thing that we both think he is and we cannot let him spend another day working with young women. Not when we have at least enough to bring him in for questioning. - Okay. - Okay? (eerie music) (eerie music continues) (eerie music continues) - I'm a good little musical theater kid. - [Nixon] Oh. - Hm. (Nixon groaning) (Nixon sighing) (Sagan laughs) Nixon. - Mm-hmm. - Nixon, wake up. We do not want miss this. (Nixon groaning) (door creaking) (birds chirping) (students groaning) Outstanding. - Hey, guys, I think I need to go lay down. Or die. I think I just might go die. - We lost Rachael. - What do you mean lost her? - She went to pee and she never came back. - Shit, she probably got lost and fell asleep in the woods. Um, someone call the cops and they'll bring someone to look for her. - My phone's gone. - Someone call. - I stole your phones. - [All] What? - You guys didn't believe me when I said I was a klepto, so I thought it would be a fun camp prank to steal your phones. - [Austin] Where are they? - Somewhere in the woods. I hid them when I was fucked up. - [Lila] Jesus, Kylie. - I'm sorry. - Mine's in my room. - I stole yours and Nixon's phones too before we left. - [Lila] Then you call. - Mine's gone too. - You stole your own phone? While I was tripping, I had an epiphany about how attached to technology I am, so I threw it in a pond. - [Lila] Oh, my God. - There's a landline in the house. (footsteps thudding) - There are no buttons. - It's a rotary phone. - Is it 1930? - Do the thing with your finger. I saw it in a movie once. - Everything okay? I heard yelling. - We lost our phones. - Wh... Honey, that's a prop phone. We just put it out 'cause we like how it looks. - You didn't notice there wasn't a dial tone? - Dial what? - Okay, what, what is going on? - We were in the woods last night and, things were not quite... (laughs) Um, Rachael came back here to pee and we never saw her again. - Have you checked her room? (students groaning) (knocking on door) - Rachael, you in there? Oh. (keys jangling) - Oh, guys, I'm not feeling too hot. I think I'm gonna puke. - Okay, well you rest up and uh, I'll come check on you in a bit. Y'all, when I said you could do whatever you want, I thought you understood that meant within the law. I don't want y'all drinking and getting drunk. - Right. We had beer. - And some wine. - Yep, beer and wine. - Listen, I get it. Y'all are working all day like adults, so you feel like adults. (sighing) I will look the other way this time, but if it happens again, I'm gonna have to report it. Just go get ready. - [Students] Yes ma'am. - He sleeps real late and he made it very clear that he doesn't wanna be disturbed seeing as how he's on TV and everything we decided that- - Shailene, is it? - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. - Unlock the door or Detective Rizzo is going to blast the damn thing open. - What kind of guns do y'all use? Me and my boyfriend- - Open the goddamn door, Shailene. (light music) Sonofabitch. - Dang. He's gone. (piano pings) (students vocalizing) (students continue vocalizing) - Thank you for joining us, Marcus. Oh, we're down to six. Any idea if Rachael will make it to rehearsal today? - It doesn't look good. - That's okay. I did a show where we lost half the cast one night and we fought through. That's what we do, right? We fight through. - (clears throat) Steph. (footsteps tapping) Those detectives are back. - Why? - I think they think Bernard killed Charles. - What? - Well, Bernard's missing. All of his stuff is gone from the hotel. - Oh, my God. - Well, they wanna talk to you and Lindsey. - Lindsey the stage manager. - Yes. - And stage managers are "responsible for all aspects of a production and work with the director, designers and performers in multiple capacities." - You read our Wikipedia page. Yay. - You were a camper here. - A long time ago. - Well, not that long. What are you, 22? - 25. - And, uh, Bernard Hewson was a teacher when you were here? - He was. - Did he ever do anything that made you feel uncomfortable? - I don't understand. - Miss Briggs, I'm not the most delicate person when it comes to talking about subjects like this. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I think Bernard Hewson is a fucking rapist who should get his dick cut off. I think Charles McMasters learned this and- - He knew. - I'm sorry? - Charles knew. They all knew. (soft music) - That must be hard. You do all that work and a bunch of actors get the credit. You ever get jealous? - I take care of my actors, all right? They'd be helpless without me, like, like kittens. You don't get jealous of kittens do you, Detective? (soft music) - Are those yours? - Yes. - I'm terrible with tools. My dad's whole family was in construction and he swore he'd never work with his hands. It's weird how that happens. Is that a box cutter? - Everybody looked the other way because having someone like Mr. Hewson on staff let them charge their ridiculous prices. - And this was gossip when you were here? - Not gossip, a girl in my class. - And no one said anything? - The girl begged everyone not to talk. She was afraid it might ruin her future career. But they knew. (soft music) - You've done very well in this business. - I've been lucky. I started early and the clinic has opened a lot of doors for me. - Do you have any advice for a young actor? - Uh, you're- - I meant for my nephew. - Oh, sorry. Tell your nephew to work hard, hustle and learn to bounce back quickly from rejection. - Nice. So um, would you go see him in a show or something if he wanted to come here? - Oh, we don't meet the campers until the first day. They send in videos. It makes the process more fair if we don't know them personally. But tell your nephew, I'm rooting for him. - Well, thank you. I really appreciate it. (car door slams) - Anything? - He is what we thought he was. And apparently everyone knew. You? - Annoying stage manager has a box cutter. Hewson could have grabbed it. - No, you were right. I mean that Hewson stuff just doesn't hold up. I mean, why would he lead us here if he was gonna flee? - He's a piece of shit who belongs in jail and you made the right call going after him. - We're missing something, Nick. - I know. - Five, six, seven, eight. (students vocalizing) (students continue vocalizing) - Oh, shit. - Oh. Shit. - I am so sorry. - [Margot] Lindsey, - Sagan, honey, don't move. I'm gonna call an ambulance. - No, I just twisted it. Is she be fine if I ice it. - I am so sorry. - No, no. It is not your fault. You can't rehearse for 12 hours and expect not- - No ones needs your opinion right now, Lindsey. - Take her back to the house. She needs to prop it up and get some rest. Nixon, can you help her? - Of course. Come on, come on. - Come on. (Sagan, Nixon straining) There you go. - [Sagan] Ah, thank you. - Am I rehearsing them too hard? I don't know what to do. Charles, Bernard. Thomas won't return my calls. I'm losing it. - I can run them through music. They can get some rest and still get some work done. - Okay, everyone, take 15. Then Steph will work on songs with you. - [Students] Thank you, 15. - [Nixon] Hey, hey. Watch out, c'mon. - All right. Right, glad I got the big one. Oh. Oh, yes, let me wrap it for you. - I do this all the time. I'll be fine. You should go back to rehearsal. - Go back to- - Hey, I can stay with her in case she needs anything. - Fine. At least take some ibuprofen. Oh, why is all of this happening today? - That woman is batshit crazy. (soft music) Really sorry. - I'm a dancer. Not a little baby actor like you. I can take it. - Perhaps this will help wash it down. - Oh, warm champagne. Classy. (soft music) (Nixon laughing) (soft music) (floorboards creaking) (knocking on door) - Rachael? Honey, I am so sorry. I lost track of time. Are you okay? (soft music) (knocking on door) (soft music) (keys jangling) (Sagan laughing) - Stop that (indistinct). - Stop it. (Nixon and Sagan laughing) Yeah. - Y'all, Rachael's gone. - She must have finally headed to rehearsal. I'm pretty sure I heard her leaving when we, uh, first got in. - You did? - Yeah, I heard something. It must have been her. You're heading back there now, aren't you? - Yes, yes, yes. I, I will just check and see if she's there. Mm-hmm, yep. - Batshit crazy. (Nixon laughing) (door creaking) (soft ominous music) Want another sip? - Rock saxophone. - Ugh. Crushed velvet baby doll dresses. - Oh, I fell in love with my share of those. Mighty Ices. - Oh, making out in the woods down by the creek. - Shannon Floyd. She had red hair. - Shit. Give me the head shots. - We've been doing this all day. It's time to shut it down. - Rizzo, the woods. - What? - Give me the head shots. (paper crackling) We have to get back to the theater. - She's gone? You told me she was sick. - She was, I- - Did you check the bathroom? - I did, and, and I- - Get your shit together. You're the fucking stage manager. Check every inch of the house and if she's not there, then check the damn woods. - Oh, for fucks sake! (Marcus gurgling) (ominous music) (Kylie screaming) (Lila screaming) (ominous music) (Lindsey whimpering) (ominous music) - Pull the fire alarms. - It's still broken. - Well, you, you said you called the City and took care of it. We have to be up to code. - Not now, Lindsey. (ominous music) Help! Help! (ominous music) (Lindsey screaming) (Lindsey crying) (Margot whimpering) No, no, no. (ominous music) (Margot whimpering) (ominous music) No, no! (knife slashes) (Kylie crying) (Kylie panting and whimpering) (ominous music) (Kylie panting) (power tool revs up) (Kylie panting) (ominous music) (Kylie screaming) (Kylie whimpering) - [Kylie] No, no. (nail gun whooshing) (nail thudding) (ominous music) (Kylie gurgling) (ominous music) - What the fuck? (tense music) - Tell 'em to send everybody. - Rizzo, wait for backup. (tense music) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) (tense music continues) - Andrews, theater camp on Euclid Street. Send everybody. - What? Put an adult on the phone. - Oh, please, no. - It's okay, it's okay. I'm a cop. (suspenseful music) You gotta get outta here. That things coming back. - I can't, I can't, I can't. - [Rizzo] What's your name? - Austin. - You look like a pretty brave kid to me. When he comes to the door, I'm gonna use whatever I got left to rush that fucker, and you're gonna be right behind me. - I don't- - He's gonna hit the wall. You're gonna run by and you're gonna fly up the stairs and you keep running until you're far away from this place. You can do this, Austin. Okay? (Rizzo grunting) (tense music) (Rizzo grunting) (knife thudding) (Rizzo groaning) (intense music) (Austin whimpering) - I knew I should have gone to STEM camp. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) - No, no, no. - The kid? - He made it out. - Other door. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (Sagan moaning) (Bernard whimpering) (Sagan moaning) (somber music) (all whimpering) - Fuck you, Nixon. (Bernard whimpering) - Jesus. (Bernard moaning) (knife slithers) (Reyes cries out) (ominous music) You can take the mask off, Miss Briggs. (somber music) - Thank goodness you're here, Detective. We are ready for a real audience. How'd you know it was me? - You said you don't meet the campers until the first day, but you toured "Into the Woods" with Nixon. You knew him really well. You brought him here. - I did. Two of our castmates in that show didn't understand the connection we had, but we made them understand. - A deep enough connection he would help you kill anyone who knew what Bernard did to you. (Bernard whimpering) - Mr. Graham and Miss Medina knew and didn't say anything. They just welcomed Bernard back year after year with open arms. And Amber, dull little idiot. When I told her what Bernard did to me, she said I should be happy because "older men are hot." - What they did to you is unforgivable, but these children did nothing to you - Bernard never gave me credit, said I knew nothing about real theater. (somber music) He was wrong. Theater is simple cause and effect. A character does this, so then this happens. Bernard did what he did, so all these people die, the guilty and the innocent, his fault. And he only comes to understand the true consequences of his actions right before his last breath. Admit it, that's a pretty dramatic ending. - Let the girls go, Steph. Don't make them pay for what Bernard did to you. - You're not giving me any credit either! I could kill Bernard, but that would be predictable, clean. No, theater should be messy, Detective. So here's how the play will end. Sagan chooses who dies. I can kill her innocent young friend Lila, or Sagan can kill Bernard, the man who tried to do to her what he did to me and so many others. Whatever she chooses, I will have set a new drama in motion. Isn't it fun? Theater is supposed to be fun! Kill yourself, I kill Lila. Kill me, Nixon kills Lila. Kill Bernard, we let the rest of you live. - Or you could have just left me alone. - You were the smart one. We needed to distract you. Remember what Bernard did to you. He deserves this. (somber music) (somber music continues) - No. (whimpering) (Bernard crying) - No. (Bernard sobbing) (Stephanie screaming) (Bernard Whimpering) (Stephanie screaming) (Bernard gurgling) - The alpha and the beta (somber music) - Ruined my ending. Now, it'll be so plain. Finish the damn show, Nixon. (suspenseful music) (lights thudding) (Stephanie screaming) (Stephanie and Sagan scuffling) - That's the problem with actors. They talk too much and they never give the stage manager enough credit. Thanks, Lindsey. (tense music) (Sagan grunting) - You all right, Detective Reyes? What the fuck? - Andrews, basement, Rizzo. (Nixon panting) (soft music) - [Sagan] I don't think it's gonna come off that easy. (soft music) - Should have left me alone. I don't need a knife to kill you. - Oh, Nixon, I just wanna hear you sing one more time. (Nixon screaming) (insects chirping) - [Reyes] Do you want this pudding? - Yeah. After this hospital diet, I'm gonna be in great shape. - Hey, watch out. All that excess flesh saved your ass. - Ha. What happened with the girl? - Nothing. I mean, boy dragged her into the woods. But being a highly trained, highly disciplined dancer, she defended herself. I mean, she's free to go. She can do whatever she wants. - [Rizzo] How does someone that age ever get over something like this? - I guess you just try to forget about your past and not worry about the future. Just live your life beat to beat.
