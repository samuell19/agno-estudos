(MultiCom Jingle) (upbeat rock music) - [Woman] Yes? - I'll have two double burgers and a vanilla malt. (car door slams) - How you doin'? - I'm fine, thanks. (engine revs) - [Woman] The malt's ready, but the burger's gonna take a while. - [Robin] Hiya, Carol. - Heater working okay? - Yeah, seems to be. - Tell me, why does the water level go down so much every day? - Evaporation. - Oh. Good reason. - You know, you might remind your husband the filter pump's about to go. - Oh, well can you fix it? - Yeah, I think it can be arranged. - I knew you could be counted on. - Carol? - Mm? - Don't you ever worry that your husband's gonna smell chlorine on the sheets? - No. (both chuckle) (lips smack) - Listen. (Carol sighs) Joan Duffy had a party last night, and I promised her that I'd be over there by noon to fix the Jacuzzi. (Carol moans) I mean, what can I tell you, I'm a working man. - Robin, I wanna tell you somethin'. - Uh, maybe I can be a little late. (Carol laughs) (door slamming) - The car has that rattle again. - Oh, I thought they fixed that. - So did I. (water splashing) - Thanks. - I'll get those cold pills. - Yes, this is Mr. Kampion again. My car has the same rattle again. Please tell Hans that I'll bring it right by. Thank you. - Summer colds are the worst. Be careful, these might make you drowsy, and you probably shouldn't operate any heavy machinery. - Thanks for the tip.

Ellen, what did he do to you? - (laughs) I don't know, but we'll see in two weeks. - (laughs) Well, I see you went and made yourself some new friends. - This is Jarret. - I think it's time for his nap. Uh, sweetheart, why don't you put him in the stroller, and I'll meet you by the pool. - See what you're missin' out on? - Don't feel too sorry for me. - Now, you'll push this cart for me, will ya, okay? Yeah. (Ellen laughs) Be a big boy, and you push for Mommy and me, all right? - Here we go. - Bye, Jarret. - Now, no funny stuff off the high dive board, you hear? - You never let me have any fun. - Hey, buddy, how's it goin'? - Okay. - You look happy, Roland. Beautiful wife, 1.8 kids. You still got the house in Sherman Oaks? - Yeah, swings in the back, station wagon in the garage, the whole bit. - Hey, Steve, you ready for me? - All set. What are we working on today? - Return of serve. - Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me. - Those things haven't changed much. - Oh yeah, beautiful women, wild parties, the whole bit. Any time you want back in, just say the word. - Can I bring Jarret? - Well, I'd wait 'til he's toilet-trained first. (chuckles) - [Both] Makes a better impression on the chicks. (laughing) - [Jarret] Me go in now. - You know what? It's nice not to have to worry about making impressions anymore. Me go swim now. - Bye bye, Robin. - [Roland] Bye bye, Robin. - Bye bye. (upbeat rock music) (hands slap) - Whup, whup, whup, you flinched. - Did not. - Hey, I know you guys are real busy right now, but do you think you could take a moment to unload the trucks and put away the gauges? - Sure thing, boss. (hand smacks) - You're dead meat, Willard. Boss, um, I almost forgot to tell you, you got a call from Mr. Auerbach. - Did he say what he wanted? - Yeah, he said he wanted to talk to you. He said, "Could I please talk to Robin?" - I'll call him later. (hand smacks) - Oh, real mature. ("Walk of Life" by Dire Straits) - Yo, Mikey. Hey! (seagulls caw) Man, looks like you got mugged by a convenience store. - Hey Robin, would you like some popcorn? I microwaved it myself. - Thought you said you weren't gonna let this thing with Linda get to you. - I lied. (laughs) - Mikey, now what would Dr. Gilovich say if he saw the way you took care of his boat? (both chuckle) - I don't think Dr. Gilovich knows he has a boat. He's only been down here once in three years. - After the game, huh? Come on. - Good Lord. - (sighing) Just fresh air, Mikey, it's not gonna kill ya. - Wouldn't bother me if it did. - You gonna be morose all day? You know, this is gonna take the fun out of volleyball. - All right, I'll be morose for the first game. Yeah, I know what you're goin' through, kid. (clicks tongue) I feel for ya. - No offense, Robin, but how would you know what I'm goin' through? - Hey, that hurts, I'm a sensitive guy. I mean, okay, so what, you lost Linda, right? I mean, what's the big deal? Look what you got here. You got the sun in the morning, you got the moon at night, you got rent-free, you got terrific friends, you got a great golden-brown, kinda red tan. You have a collection of boat shoes. So-so body. Feelin' better yet? - No. - Good. - Comin' back buddy. - In your face. - Comin' back! - Come on. - Whoa. - Here we go, Michael. - Yep. - Okay, hit it back. - Right over here. - I got it. - One. - You're out. (men all yell at once) - [Bradley] You guys are so lucky. - [Robin] Lucky? - Lucky? - 15 to two is lucky? - Wait a minute, we got the sun in our eyes, you guys had the wind at your backs. Look at Bradley, he's not even wearing the right sunblock. But, we are gonna give you another chance. Double or nothing, two on a side for points, huh? - Ha, we'll take it. - Fine. Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa. - What? - [Michael] Over there in the beach chair. - Oh, not again. - Oh my gosh. (men laughing) - Woo! You or me? - You're better at it than I am. - Oh, that's so true, thank you. (screaming) (men yelling) - [Man] Are you okay, are you okay? - I think I need a doctor. - It's all right. - Oh my goodness. - Please move aside, we have an injured volleyball player here. It's all right, buddy, you passing out? Breathe deeply, excuse me. - Excuse us. - Do you have any medical experience? - Ow. - No. (laughing) - I guess you're not a doctor, then, huh. Breathe, deep, buddy, breathe deep, that's it. - You a carpenter, by any chance? I'm looking for a good carpenter. - I'm a flight attendant. - A flight attendant? - That's perfect. - I think we gotta airlift him outta here. - Ron here teaches flying, I mean, you two could talk about turbulence-- - Reminisce about altitude sickness, food preparation? You can, Brad, Brad, it's all right. - It's all right, breathe deep, Brad, breathe deep. - You've gotta know something about first aid, right? Over here, look, just touch it, feel it. - That's the wrong foot. But the pain's gone! - He can walk! (men cheer) - You did it. - Are you one of those faith healers? - Got something else you want healed? - Hey. - I don't wanna take advantage of your good nature. - Who says I have a good nature? - [All] You look like you have a very, very good nature. - What's your name? - Kelli, who are you? - [Robin] Robin. - I'm Steve. - Hi, Steve, Robin, you guys do this a lot, don't you? - All, right, Kelli, I mean, look, it was a ploy, okay? But we had, like, a great reason. Michael is incredibly attracted to you. And he was just wondering if, by chance, you might be free this evening. - And who is Michael? - I'm Michael, and that moron used to be my friend. - Well, Michael, it's a pleasure to meet you, except I'm on a 5:45 flight to San Francisco tonight. - Aww. - Maybe some other time. - Aww, no fair. - Come on. - That's life. See you guys, goodbye. - Bye. Well, that was fun. Any other brilliant ideas? - Brad, what are you doin' tonight? (upbeat rock music) - Okay, this is my boss's plane, so no food fights-- - Relax. - We can play with the Frisbee. - [Steve] Relax, everything's gonna be fine. I get to sit in the back? - All right. - [Robin] Let's get goin', it's almost 5:45. Come on, move it. All right, who's gonna steer. Whose lap am I gonna sit on? - [Michael] Here, go deep. (jet engines whine) - Okay, Mikey, relax, be cool. - [Michael] Well, this is a coincidence. - I don't believe you guys. - Well, they insisted on tagging along. - Actually, we all have very pressing engagements. - Very pressing. - He'll have to tell you about his uranium mine. (all laugh) - I would love to hear all about your uranium mines, but I've got a pressing engagement, too, so uh, maybe another time, huh? Bye. - Go on, Mike. - Talk to her? - [Woman On PA] Now Boarding at Gate 17. - Cancel it. - (laughing) I can't. - What's his name? - That's none of your business. - Kelli, Kelli, come on, a grown boy is begging you. I mean, I guarantee you're gonna have a better time with Michael than you ever would with what's-his-name. - And how are you gonna do that? Are you gonna come along, too? - I just know Michael, he's a terrific guy. - Then why does he need you to get his dates for him? - He doesn't. Wait. Okay, I'll you the real story. - This I have to hear. - Well, he just broke up with someone. He's not exactly up to being rejected right now. - Well, listen, um, I'm real flattered and everything, but I'm just not interested in your friend Michael, or in his love life. However, (pen clicks) if you wanted to give me call, that'd be another matter. I'll be back in town on Wednesday. Bye. - [Woman On PA] Ladies and gentlemen on flight number 356, your luggage will be placed on carousel three in baggage claim area. - What an airhead. Mikey, I just saved you from a very forgettable evening. - Well, what'd she say? - Relax, it's not you. She, uh, is dating a pilot, so she, uh, only flies solo. - What's that mean? - It means she doesn't step out on him. - What now, any suggestions? (hand slapping) - Reno's nice this time of year. - She couldn't handle you anyway. (men chuckle) (Robin sighs) - You've been cleaning that exact same spot for 15 minutes. - Well, you know me, Stan, I like to be thorough. (laughs) - Must have been some night last night. I tried reaching you a few times yesterday. - Yeah, sorry I didn't have a chance to get back to you. - Where were you? - Well, I started out in San Francisco, then Reno, Brad lucked into a plane. - You guys are too much. Boy, I'd love to be able to take off like that. Listen, why don't you let that rest for a few minutes and come inside the house? I've got something I wanna talk to you about. (stick clatters) That's Santa Barbara, the quarter-finals. You crunched them. - Yeah. You know, I think I chose the wrong sport. What's he make, a million, million and a half? That's only for six months. - Yeah, but does he have as much fun as you do? - Hey, I'm not complaining. I got plenty of it. And I haven't forgotten who helped me get the business started. - You know, I've been thinking about getting you started on something a little better. - What do you mean? - Well, I think you're too good to still be doing this at 32. How would you like to come in to my construction business? I'm talking about a career now, not just a job. - Stan, I dunno, it doesn't sound like me. - But it can be, if you give it a try. And there's a lot of money to be made. - I know, but uh, my needs, uh, (laughs) they're not quite the same as yours. - Well, don't be so quick to put it down. Do yourself a favor, think about it. - Fine, I'll think about it. - Great, great. Now, I've got (clears throat) another proposition to make. - Must be my lucky day. - Well, maybe. My son Justin's out here for the summer. He just graduated from high school, prep school, and it's been a long time since he's spent any real time out here. Barbara's kinda kept him under lock and key back East. So he hasn't had a lot of what you might call experience. - How many kids his age have? - Oh, come on now, I'm sure you did, for one. Anyway, Robin, I'd like you to do me a favor. I'd like you to keep him for the summer. - What? - Well, let him work with you, and, you know, have the other related experiences that might come with that. I'll pick up his salary. - Come on, Stan, you know I always work my route alone. - Robin, I need you to do this favor for me. I mean, if you're smart, this will be the last summer you'll be doing the pool bit, anyway. (cue cracks) (ball thuds) Justin, you know Robin Prince. (glass thuds) (glass crashes) Now, why don't you watch what you're doing? - I'm sorry, it was an accident. (Stan sighs) I'll get the sponge. (Robin laughs) (upbeat rock music) Looks like a moderately successful stockbroker lives here. - Nothing that exciting. Just a studio executive. Grab some chlorine, will ya? I have to get you some new shorts. (arm thuds against car) - What's wrong with these? - Ow. No one wears cutoffs anymore. (car door slams) (car engine revs) - These are perfectly good dungarees. I just had to cut 'em off 'cause I had a hole in 'em. (car engine zooms) - Dungarees? (laughs) Who says dungarees? - Pardon me. I'm not as hip as you are. It's got. - We're gonna test the pH balance of the water. - Sounds exciting. - Well, it's not as exciting as cutting off your dungarees, but it's gonna have to do. (laughs) (engine rumbles) - Home sweet home. Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow, right? - Not so fast, Justin. Still got your pool to do. - I know, I know. Test the water. (Jamie gasps) - You must be the pool man. - Guess it was the skimmer the was the dead giveaway, right? - That, and the fact that Stanley told me you were coming. - [Justin] Hi, Jamie. - [Jamie] Hi, Justin. How was your first day on the job? - It was okay, I guess. Uh, this is my boss, Robin, this is my cousin, Jamie Harrison. - Your cousin? Huh. Your whole family comin' out to LA for the summer? - Some of us actually live here. I just put myself in a swimming program. - Well, I hate to be the one to break the bad news, but you might have to miss a week. We're gonna do an acid wash. - Ooh, that sounds serious. - Only to swim in it. - Did you bring the new piece? - Yep, it's already up in the living room. - Great. Jamie's an artist. Maybe you've seen the box with the figures inside in the den? The one called Palm Springs? - Right, yeah, yeah, I have seen it. It's nice. - Thanks. - The Museum of Modern Art is having a show on Joseph Cornell I went to see. - He's so good, isn't he? - Oh yeah, I just love the detail he gets into his boxes. - Yeah, I know an artist named Joe Cornell. Does album covers. (Jamie exhales) Guess it's not the same one, huh? - I doubt it, the one we're talking about it dead. - Guess it's not him. But he was sick last time I saw him. - (laughs) I gotta go. Will you tell your dad I'll call him tomorrow? - [Justin] Okay. - I guess he could be dead by now. - Goodbye. - Really blew her doors off. Huh? Hm. (Willard humming) - Willard? Can I do that? - I drooled. - Darn. (telephone rings) - Guys. - Hi, boss. - Any messages? - No. (distorted speech) - [Robin] What? - I said, nobody loves you, Robin. - That's what you guys think. Bel Air Pools. - Robin Prince, please. - You got him. - Hi there, this is Jamie Harrison. - Uh-huh? - I met you yesterday at my uncle's house. - Right, right, I remember, um, goggles, swim cap, Museum of Modern Art? - Well, I was just calling for a rather strange reason. - Don't tell me, you wanna talk to Justin about the Cousins' Club meeting? - No, I want your body. - (laughing) You're kiddin', right? - Not altogether. (crickets chirping) (dog barking) - Well, I'm not sure why I'm here, but uh, I'm here. - Come on in. - Oh, yeah, these are great. Huh, little people in little boxes. - You know, I never thought of doing a pool man until I saw you the other day. - Really? - Mm-hm. - Okay, what do you want me to do? - Well, I wanna take a photo of you holding that skimmer. - Anything for art, where do you want me? - Over there will be fine. You know, you and I have friends in common. - Really, who's that? - [Jamie] Larry and Carol Kampion. - Oh, I wouldn't say they're my friends. I do their pool. I rarely see him. She seems nice, though. - You think so? Can you just stand the way you usually do? - 'Course, I hardly know her. - That's funny. She said she's been sleeping with you. (camera clicks and whines) Good. - Great, great, now that you caught me with my pants down, and with my foot in my mouth, what else would you like me to do? - Nothing. What you and Carol Kampion do is your own business. I mean, just drop it, never bring it up again. - Consider it dropped. - So, just out of curiosity, how did you and Carol get started? Did she invite you in to see her trash compactor, or were you guys in the same fraternity, or what? - Matter of fact, she invited me in for a cup of coffee, and we started to talk. - What did you talk about? - Music, art, literature, science. The usual. - I see what Carol sees in you. - (laugh) Gee, thanks. - So, now when you're not cleaning pools, or drinking coffee with Carol, what do you do? - Are we talkin' hobbies now, Jamie? Well, I stopped building model airplanes 'cause they started cluttering up my room, and I got tired of takin' 'em out in the back yard and shootin' at 'em with my BB gun. Now, hell, I just do needlepoint. What do you do when you're not inviting strange men over to pose for you? - I work. - Really. Well, you oughta get out and have a little fun. It'd be good for ya. - So I hear. - Invite me back when you finish whatever it is you're doing of me, huh? (footsteps click) - [Justin] Do these people have a gardener? - Three, full-time. They pay 'em to keep it lookin' like this. - [Ann] Hi, Robin! - [Terry] Oh! - Hi Terry, Ann. - Hi. - I didn't know you guys were back, how was Italy? - What, when we arrived in Milan it was pouring, so we said forget this, and we went straight through to the Greek Islands, and we had a blast. - Yeah. (laughs) - I went to Greece two summers ago with my mother. Well, I got sun poisoning. - Oh. - Terry, Ann, this is Justin, my assistant. - Hi. - Hi. (Terry laughs) - Hi. - So, you guys had a great time? - Oh, yeah, it was wonderful. But it really was not the same without you. (both girls giggle) - Justin, um, the pool is right down that path. Just follow the fork to the right, and when you get to the gazebo, hang a left, can't miss it. (girls giggle) - Where'd you get him? - He's on loan for the summer. (laughs) - Robin, you woulda loved Mykonos. - Yeah, the water was unreal, it had this sort of white-blue color, you know? So you could practically see everything without a mask. (girls giggle) - You might have tried skimming while you were waiting. - Didn't know what you wanted me to do. - Come on, Justin, not hard to see there are a few leaves in the pool. - How do I know it's not part of the total effect? - (scoffs) Never mind. Look, there's the chlorine. Grab a bottle, pour in a gallon, okay? (dog growls) (dog barks) - Get away, get away. Get away from me! Get him away from me. - Relax. Take it easy, he's not gonna hurt ya. Max, get back in the house. Go on. (dog growls) Oh no. - I'm okay. - You're not! You got chlorine all over the chair. Quick, we'll let some water on it. (water splashing) Give me the hose. Come on, move it. This chair is slightly more expensive than your damn shirt. - Here. And I wouldn't worry about the chair, either, 'cause I'm sure if you asked him, my father would be happy to pay for it. - Justin. (mid-tempo dramatic music) Justin. Hey. - Leave me alone. You don't want me around any more than my father does. Why don't you just say it? - It's not true. Wait a minute. (Justin shouts) I know my father's paying for all this. You don't have to worry about what he's gonna say. He likes you. - Justin, I'm sorry. I've never had anybody work with me before, and I'm not used to it. - Fine. (foot thuds) Just take me home, okay? (engine revs) (mellow jazz music) Where are you goin'? - We're takin' the rest of the day off, goin' to the beach. - You don't have to do this. He's not paying you to be my friend, too. - You know, maybe he's not as bad as you think. - I wouldn't know. My entire life, I don't think I've spent more than two hours alone with him. - The truth is, he doesn't know what to do with ya. He's scared of ya. - Scared of me? - Yeah. (laughs) He wants you to like him, to love him. He just doesn't know how to go about doin' it. So in the meantime, let's just enjoy what we got here, okay? - So what do we got? - Oh, man, we got the sun in the morning, we got the moon at night. Justin, you couldn't have picked a better place to be for the summer. You got a great chance to meet some fairly attractive women, and you've got a wonderful opportunity to learn the subtleties of the pool-cleaning business. What more could you ask for, huh? - What about my pension plan? (both laugh) - [Steve] So Justin, what's prep school like? Have co-ed dorms? - No. I mean, it wasn't that type of school. It was, it was pretty traditional. I did have a horse, though. - [All] (laughing) Oh. - [Brad] Where did you go for privacy? - Back to my room. - And how did you get rid of your roommate? - I roomed alone. - So you brought the girls back to your room? - (laughs) We weren't allowed to bring girls back to our rooms. - Well, if you didn't have a car, and you didn't bring the girls back to your room? (Steve laughs) - Guys. I think you are embarrassing the lad. - You're not embarrassing me. The opportunity never presented itself. - Never? - Justin, don't worry about it. You got all summer. - [Waitress] Hey, is everything all right here, guys? (guys mumble) - Yeah, everything's all right here, but I'm a little worried about you. - Me? - Yeah, I can tell they're workin' you too hard. - (laughs) Tell me about it. I had to go on two shifts this week already. - Two, wow, then what you need to do is get someone to take care of you for a change. Learn how to relax. - Do you have anybody special in mind for that? (all except Justin clear throats and speak at once) - No, guys, down, down. Well, I don't know, I thought maybe you and I could get together. I could help you look. - That sounds like a plan. I get off at 12. - (laughs) Unbelievable. (Robin laughs) (engine hums) - Car's still here. - Must be a nice neighborhood. (Robin sighs) So anyway, thanks. - What are you thankin' me for? - Oh, I don't know, I'm polite, when I bump into a chair I apologize. (laughs) - It's gonna be a great day. - Yeah, it is. - Sorry. (both chuckle) - Maybe I'll get my car washed. It's ladies' day. So um, anyway, I'll see you again? - Sure. - Okay. (engine rumbles and accelerates) - Well, did you have a good time? - Justin, I'd like to think we both had a good time. (engine revs) - Okay. (equipment clatters) Let me get it, I'll get it. - Lemme get it! - No, no. - Lemme get it, here. - Go away. You know, if we're gonna be workin' the same area, we oughta think about carpooling. - Hope you're not gonna force me to find another place to swim. I'm running out of patrons. - Nope, this one's fine. - Except my eyes are really stinging. - Yeah. (chuckles) Guess we should cut back on the amount of chlorine we're usin'. Any chance I could get, like, a sneak preview of that whatever it is you're doin' of me? - I wish you could. But there's nothing to see yet. I haven't started it. Well, it was nice seeing you again. Bye, Justin. - Bye, Jamie. (engine revs) - Jamie said you were over at her place posing. - Hardly posing, she just took a picture of me. We all do what we can for the arts. And I like her work. - You know, we have one of her pieces in the den. Maybe you'd like to see it? - I don't think I've ever been in your den. - Come on, I'll show you. - Carol, maybe we can do this next week, when I have more time. - (scoffs) Isn't that why you have an assistant, to give you more time? - I would like to see her work. - Come on. (water sloshes) Don't you think she's got, like, a great sense of humor? - Yes, in her work. Robin, she is definitely not your type. She is far too serious. (telephone rings) (lips smack) - Regina. Regina, will you please get the phone? Hello? Yes, this is she. You do? (gasps) Oh no, that's great. Thank you so much. (phone clicks) I have been waiting for weeks to get an appointment with this fabulous new skin technician, and he just had a cancellation. I'm sorry, Robin, I've gotta go. (lips smack) Next week, okay? - Sure. (upbeat music) (telephone rings) Hello? - I'm gonna solve the chlorine problem in the pool by adding eye wash to the water. If you ever have any trouble with your teeth, I can always throw in some fluoride. - You know what, you should just go into a new business, holistic pool cleaning. - (laughs) That's not a bad idea. You know, in this town, I'd probably make a fortune. Um, listen, this is supposed to be a personal call, not a business call. - Personal? - Where I stumble around for a while makin' small talk 'til I get up enough nerve to ask you out. - (laughing) That's pretty smooth stumbling. When do you have in mind? - Tonight, if it's not too short notice. - I can't do that, because I've gotta go to an art opening downtown. - Downtown? Whoo, you're brave. You're sure you don't need, like, a bodyguard, or an armored tank, or somethin'? - Well, it's not that bad. - How 'bout just, like, a good old-fashioned escort? - Well, if you're really that interested in going, how about five o'clock? - Terrific. See you then. - Okay, bye. - [Justin] Hey, Robin? - Huh? - Do you think I'd have better luck with girls if I bought a motorcycle? - That what Darryl and Willard told ya? - Yeah. - Well, you can try it, Justin, but if it doesn't work, don't let 'em talk you into the tattoo. - Maybe I'll just borrow my dad's Mercedes. - Good idea. (crowd chattering) (mellow jazz music) - You ever think he gets the urge to break out of the rut? You know, really do somethin' crazy? Go off in secret and paint a circle somewhere? - Possibly. - Well it, uh, certainly is, uh, colorful. - If you really wanna know what you're looking at, you're looking at nothing. It's empty. There's no meaning, no purpose. I'm glad you could come. - It's wonderful. Robin, I'd like you to meet Colin Lambre, the artist. - Hey, how you doin'? How come it's empty? - Because Colin loves to make a point about the importance of not making a point. - (chuckles) Good point. But you could do me a big favor. Come take a look at something I'm still working on? No one else has seen it yet. - What's the matter? Are you afraid some meaning has crept into it? - Yes. - Oh dear, I'll be right back. (Robin sighs) - Nice track light. Ah. (door clicks) (crickets chirp) - Can I get you some coffee or something? - No thanks. That gallery opening was excitement enough for one night. (Jamie chuckles) - Were you and Colin ever like, uh-- - No. We never uh'ed. I take it you didn't like the art show. - I didn't like the paintings much. But uh, Colin's scarf was pretty groovy, though. - You know, I bet he'd let you borrow that. - When did you know you wanted to be an artist? - Always. When did you know you wanted to be a pool man? - Since I was a little kid. When all my other friends were playin' around in rain puddles, I was the one spot-checkin' for algae. (Jamie laughs) Say, uh, when's my whatchamacallit gonna be ready? - Oh, I don't know, I'm at a standstill. Every time I should be working, I find myself cleaning closets and putting out snail bait. - You're the one. You know what would be really neat? Did you ever wanna do like a Alice in Wonderland kinda thing with one of these? You wanna just crawl right into it? - Yep, all the time. I think that's my problem. I'm so comfortable in that world, that sometimes I have a hard time in the real one. (romantic music) - This wouldn't be, like, the end of the evening part, would it? - [Jamie] I think it would be. - Ah, thanks, I didn't know. Uh, can we do the part where I ask you out again? - Okay. - Wanna go out again? - Sure. (both chuckle) (birds chirp) (Robin yelps) - [Justin] Gesundheit. (seagulls caw) - Guess who I bumped into last night. - Gimme a hint. - Kelli the stewardess. - Some hint. - Well, I can't help it, I'm in love. - Who's Kelli the stewardess? - Oh, just possibly my future bride, the mother of my children, someone who can get me discount tickets to Europe. (Justin chuckles) That doesn't matter, last night things went great. - You know, I really don't wanna hear the details. - Well, I do. - Well, I'll tell ya later. Listen, we're gonna sail to Catalina when she gets a free weekend, you wanna grab a date and come along? - Possibility. - And you can come too, Justin, when you find Miss Right. - I'm trying, I'm trying. - Oh, God, she was great. - [Brad] All right, woo! (claps hands) - [Steve] Okay, it's serious time, game point. Come on, let's go now, serve it up. - All right, come on. Serve it! - All right, here we go. - Got it, you got it! (all cheer) - Get it, Justin! (Justin laughs) - Yeah! (Brad grunts) (ball thuds) - Eat leather, Justin! (Steve laughs) - Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. (energetic pop music) Looks like a likely candidate over there, huh? - Now? - Now or never. - No. - Now. (Justin yelps) - Here we go. - You ready? (Justin yells) (men laugh) - [Justin] Oh God, I think it's broken. My feet, my feet! (Steve grunts) - [Brad] You're okay, Justin, just take it easy 'til you feel better, buddy. (Justin gasping in pain) - [Steve] We'll be back to get him in a few days, okay? - [Mike] Now, I want you to take good care of him, he's our star volleyball player, you hear? (Justin grunting in pain) - (laughing) Bye, Justin! - Where you guys goin'? (men laugh) - Don't forget to rise buddy, be gentle now. ♪ Over you ♪ ♪ You ♪ - You ever been to Catalina on a boat? - No, have you? - No, I'm from New York. - Unreal, do you know Brooke Walker? She went to my high school, she went there to be a model. - I've never met her, but I'll remember her name, Brooke Walker. - I'd like to go to New York, except for the crime. - My mom got her purse snatched, it was matinee time, too. There were, there were thousands of people around. And he just disappeared into the subway. - Bummer. - That's what she thought. - Oh, by the way, I'm Stacy. - Oh, hi. - (giggling) Hi. - Ha ha! ♪ Yeah, overrated ♪ (crowd chattering) - That was great, thank you. - You're welcome. - You know, I haven't had zabaglione since I was in Genoa. - What made you last that long? If I don't get zabaglione at least twice a week, my entire body goes into shock. Hey, it's none of my business, but I'm gonna ask you anyway. Who'd you go to Genoa with? - Me. I went by myself. Have you ever been to Italy? - Nah, my entire European experience consists of two weeks in West Germany playin' volleyball every night. Won 10, lost four. The cultural highlight was a beer-drinking contest with the team from Munich. Been to uh, Mexico and Hawaii a few times, though. - Am I allowed to ask, with whom? - Just the guys. - Have you ever gone anyplace alone? - Ah, every once in a while I might make a trip to the market or something without consulting anyone. I get lonely easily. - Well maybe you just don't have enough practice. - Yeah, maybe. (crickets chirp) (romantic music) (lips smack) - Good night, Robin. - Good night? Aw, heck, Jamie. I had the swim fins and the Huns outfit all set for tonight. (Jamie laughs) - Well, that's an interesting idea. Maybe we should do that again some other time. - Listen, I understand you wanna take it slow. So next week, we'll go to a movie, we don't even have to sit in the same row or nothin'. - Won't that make it kind of hard to share the popcorn-- I'm either cold or nervous. - Are you nervous now? - Maybe I'm just cold. - Yeah, maybe. I can feel a cold front moving right through here. - Well, maybe we should go inside and climb into bed and warm up a little bit. - Great idea. How come I didn't think of that? - You did. - Right. I did. (birds chirping) Only farmers and obstetricians get up this early. - I was gonna take a shower but I didn't wanna wake you. - You must sing very loud. (Jamie chuckles) Whoa. Jamie, good morning. - Good morning. (lips smack) I have an appointment at nine o'clock so I have to rush. - Hey. Um, am I gonna like, see you again? - Sure. It doesn't mean we're gonna spend the night together. We'll have to see how things go. - Sounds good to me. - Robin, can I ask you a question? - Fire away. - Okay, like with you and Jamie, how many dates before, uh, you know, I mean like, was it like the second or third, or the sixth or seventh? I'm just tryin' to get a standard. - Well, every relationship's different. Why, what's the problem? - I think I need my own apartment. I mean, her parents are always home, or the maid or my dad is always around. (equipment thuds) - How'd you like to use my place? - (chuckles) You're kidding. (Robin laughs) That would be unbelievable. I promise, I wouldn't even use the stereo. - Justin, relax, I trust you. - Thanks. (laughs excitedly) When? - As soon as I'm sure I'm not gonna be there. - Do you think you can like, not be there really soon? (Robin laughs) Please? - Yeah. (Justin laughs) - Oh yes! (energetic pop music) So great, gonna be great! (laughs) I love, it I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it! (laughing) (pebbles thud) (door opens) - Hiya, Rob. - Hiya, Jame. - What're you doin'? - Well, I saw this done in a movie once. Think it was, uh, Cary Grant. He was tryin' to get Katherine Hepburn to come to her bedroom window. (pebble thuds) - Yeah? - Yeah. - She was probably on the second floor. - Still works. (Jamie laughs) - What are you doing? - Thought I'd drop by and take you to Santa Barbara for the weekend. - Now? You mean, just like that? - Well, you might wanna grab a toothbrush or somethin'. Come on, Jamie, what are you thinkin' about? Let's just do it. - Robin, do you always live life like a beer commercial? - Yeah. (laughing) (upbeat music) - This place is so cute. - So, cute? (laughing) - [Jamie] It is cute! (hand slaps) (Robin laughs) - [Robin] Ta-da. - [Jamie] Ta-da. - [Robin] Ahh. (romantic music) (Robin sighs) (Jamie sighs) - Wanna play a little tennis before dinner? - Do you? - I asked you first. (laughs) - Okay. - Sun's goin' down. - We have all weekend. We could just stay here tonight and have dinner. - I'd like that. (both chuckle) - This is fun. - (laughs) Life's too long not to have fun. - (laughing) You can never have too much fun. This beats tennis all to hell. You need to start wearing shirts with snaps. (bells chime) (seagulls caw) - First girl I ever fell in love with lived about a mile from here. Her name was Pam Renzocchi. We were 14. (choir singing) - Well, whatever happened to Pam Renzocchi? - She became Pam Funkhauser. (both laugh) - Some people have no luck. Have you ever wanted to get married? - When I was 17, I thought I wanted to marry Cathy Carter. - And what happened to Cathy Carter? - Found out I wanted other girls. - You ever wanna get married? - Yeah. - What happened? - He didn't. - Yeah. Scares me that maybe I'm the type of person that can't be satisfied with just one person. (soft music) Can I ask you something? You think you could ever love anybody like me? - No way. (laughs) (Robin laughs) Yeah. And that's what worries me. - Why does it worry you? - Because I don't know if you've gotten all the women out of your system yet. - Well, I'm always gonna be attracted to other women. Because I guess I just love women. But as long as I look and don't touch, what's the harm, right? - I'll think about it. - Guys are gettin' curious about you. - (clicks tongue) The guys. Do these guys ever come separately, or do they always come in a six-pack? - Guess we're gonna have to arrange a meeting. - Sounds serious, like the SALT talks. (tennis balls thudding) (can cracks and hisses) - Hey, hey, yo yo, hold on, hold on, hold on, you got a little explain' to do there, pal. Where you been hidin' lately? - Well, it's the late, great Robin Prince, we almost put an APB out on you, boy. - Ooh, Saturday night, you should've been there, the place was crawlin' with chicks. We bagged our limit by 10 o'clock, and were already throwin' the small ones back. Where were you? - Santa Barbara. With Jamie. (laughs) - A whole weekend with her? - Look, what are you guys so concerned about? I mean, we didn't rob a bank, didn't shoot anybody. Heck, we didn't even get married. - Not yet. - Robin. (Robin laughs) Robin, buddy. Where you been, buddy? I've been lookin' all over for you. Listen, the one on the right is Holly. The one on the left is Paula. Bein' the kinda guy I am, I'm gonna give you first pick. - Okay, I'll have a cheeseburger and some fries. - What? - Come on. - What? - We're worried about you. - Okay. Then I'll have a spinach salad and some carrot juice. - That's not funny. - Excuse me, here. Excuse me, here. Now, uh, I'm not exactly sure, but I don't think you've ever been this serious about anyone before, am I right? - Brad, what's serious? We're talkin' a weekend, here. - This girl is definitely a bad influence. (Robin laughs) - But, but, listen, hey. Hey, we are gonna give you a second chance. I got the plane this weekend, and a flight plan to Coronado, huh, yes, yes? - No. - No? (sighs) - Robin, I love you, buddy, but you're gettin' to be a drag. Bradley? Doubles? - Yes, Steven. - Good. - You're in love with this girl, aren't you? You can tell me, I can handle it. (Robin laughs) So when are we gonna meet her? (plate clinks) - My specialty. Got a magical way with beans. - And what's your secret? Opening the can and heating them up? (lips smack) - Who told you? (chuckles) - Aren't you at all curious to know what's behind door number two over there? - Dinette set? - Close. La-da. - I love it. - Really? - Yeah, really. I just don't know how you're gonna fit it into one of those little glass cases. - That's the whole idea, it's a new space. Remember when you said you wanted to walk through the little boxes? - Mm-hm. - Well, now you can. - Jamie, this is great. You oughta do a whole series like this. - That's what I'm gonna do, you're the one who gave me the idea. You're great. (lips smack) And you can cook. - Huh. - What's that? - Mm, letter from Uncle Stanley. - Oh, it's an invitation to a party. Ow! - What kind of party? - Once a year, Stanley gives a party for David Crockett's birthday. - Oh, yeah, I heard about those kinda parties. I'm not on the list. (laughs) - Do you wanna come? (people laugh and chatter) Now, the trick to these parties is to keep smiling, and never tell anyone your real name. - Gotcha. - Good. - Robin, what are you doing here? Justin said you and the guys were driving down to Ensenada. - Thought this'd be more fun. - You stay here, I'll go to Ensenada. (lips smack) Oh, you look beautiful. - Thank you, Stanley. - I don't know why you're wasting your time on him, though. I guess he does have a certain charm. Look at you. I didn't even think you owned a tie. - Yeah, and long pants, too. - Incidentally, I saw Justin's girlfriend yesterday and she's a knockout. Whatever you're telling him, keep it up. - What have you been telling him. - Nothing. - [Jamie] There's a lot of pretty girls here today. - [Robin] Mm-hm. - [Jamie] (laughing) Walk much? - [Man] Jamie. - Larry, how you doin'? - (lips smack) Fine, how are you? - Larry Kampion, this is Robin Prince. - How do you do? - How do you do? - This is a fun party, isn't it? - This is my wife, Carol, Carol, this is Robin, uh, I didn't get your last name. - Prince. - [Larry] I didn't know you two know each other. - Oh, he's our pool man, darling. - I knew that. Just testing. You told my wife we need a new, um-- - Filter pump. - Filter pump. - Right. About to go any time. - Uh, Jamie? I want you to meet someone who's very rich and he loves your work, come on. Jamie, come on. - Talented girl. - Very talented. - Well, I'll tell you what, uh, you just get me an estimate on that pump, and I'll take a look at it. - Will do. - Excuse me. (engine humming) - All right, guys. Here's the deal. From now on, work on your bikes on your own time. (telephone rings) Get the phone, Willard. - You're the boss, boss. - Darryl. I want this parking area swept once a week. And the bikes, from now on, park 'em in the back, understood? It's a place of business. Not your private junkyard. - Junk? (boat horn hoots) - Well, well, well. - My, my. - What a view. - They're staring. - They usually do. - Hey, you're late, Michael's threatening severe punishment if we miss the outgoing tide. - But he did say you could have your choice of keel-hauling or flogging. - Uh, Jamie Harrison, this is Brad Williams. - Hi. - Hi. - That is Steve Cooper. - Hi, Jamie. - Hi, nice to meet you. - I was starting to think that you were a figment of Robin's imagination. - Okay, let's go! Batten down the hatches hoisten the mizzen, mates, keel-haul the crew, Prince, where's the beer? Nice girl, all right, let's head out to sea. - So these are the guys? - Fun, aren't they? (men laughing) - I look forward to this. (laughing) (lively music) Yo Robin, you remember Kelli, don't ya? - Sure. 5:45 to San Francisco. How you doin'? - Great, I'm a little mad at you, though. - Me? - I asked Michael about his uranium mines, and there aren't any. (Michael laughs) - Jamie, that's Kelli. Kelli, that's Jamie. - Hello. - Hi there. - You guys, this reminds me of that trip we took down to Mazatlan last summer. - Oh yeah, those two girls. - Who did we finally end up taking? - Oh, those two girls. - Terry and who was her sister's name? - Terry and Ann white? - Come on. - You know those girls? - Yeah, we do their pool. - What've you got? - I thought Ann told me that just you two went down to Cabo last summer. (Michael clears throat) Or was it Terry? I remember, it was both of 'em, right? - [Michael] I think it's time to keel-haul somebody. - So you're the one that writes all those letters to Penthouse. Why don't you tell us about it? - We went down to Cabo, took the ferry to the mainland, flew back from Puerto Vallarta. I'm thirsty, you thirsty? Is anyone thirsty? - I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty. - Yeah, yeah. - The drinks, they still in the cooler? - I think they're in the cooler down below, buddy. (clears throat) - [Kelli] I'll help you. (Steve sighs) (apple crunches) - Isn't this great? - Great. - Next time, about eight less people and a bigger boat, I promise. - Why, it's like camp. I'm waiting for the pillow fight to begin. - I know this place in Catalina, we can rent horses, go up into the hills, and they will never find us. - Woo, all right. - That's beautiful. - What are the teams, eh? - What a moment. - [Steve] Wait a minute. - Oh! - Great, great shot. - [Brad] So, uh, so what's first, guys? Uh, the casino? It's supposed to be really nice and they got a great view up there. - [Woman] How about the glass-bottomed boat? - [Steve] Are you kidding, we just got off the water. Can you believe her, guys? (laughing) - [Michael] You know, I think we oughta go look at the indigenous plants. - Yeah. - No, no, we could rent a Jeep, drive over to the isthmus, rent tanks, and go fishing for abalone, it'd be great. - [Steve] Wait a minute, wait a minute, they got buffalo, you know, let's go see a buffalo. - [Robin] We'll catch you guys back at the hotel! - Hey, wait a minute. - Where you goin'? - Hey! - Robin! - Come on. - Robin! - Go! - Where you guys goin'? (birds caw) - Well, we're alone now. (horse snorting and whinnying) - (laughing) I'm lonely. (Jamie laughs) - Excuse me, great idea. (men cheer and laugh) - Great. - All right, all right, yeah. - Nice catch! - Here, come on, come on. (men shouting at once) - Go deep! - Who, Trigger, stop this. - Stop, you guys. (horse snorting) - Watch out, watch out. (laughing) - You're in my way. - [Steve] Move your horse. - [Robin] Hey, Jamie? Sorry. - Why are you sorry? - For draggin' you on this weekend? - Oh, don't worry about it. - We don't have to do this again. - Yay! (both laugh) (pounding on door) - [Steve] Hey, break it up in there, it's chow-down time, let's go! (Robin sighs) (Jamie sighs) (Robin laughs) (boat horn blares) - [Robin] You ever afraid of anything? - [Jamie] Yeah, I'm afraid of being trapped in an elevator. With the guys! (both laugh) - Jamie, you know somethin'? - [Jamie] What? - [Robin] If we miss this boat, we'll be stuck with them all day tomorrow. (laughing) - Now wait a minute, wait a minute, if you decide to turn back, you got a long way to swim. - [Robin] I am an awful swimmer. (laughs) Cast off, hurry, cast off! (boat horn blares) - [Justin] You know, the guys are really ticked off that you left like that. You shoulda stuck around, you woulda met Megan. - Who's Megan? - This unbelievable girl I'm taking out tonight. - What happened to Stacy? - Nothin'. It's just that after the horseback riding, she didn't wanna do anything but soak in the tub. So, Mike and Kelli and I went for a walk, and that's when I met Megan. Let's face it, I'm not the monogamous type of guy. It's summer, I don't wanna get tied down. - We got a tear here. I'll get the spare. - How you doin'? - Yo Dad, how you doin'? - Great. - I owe you one, Robin. You've done a great job with Justin. I've never seen him have so much confidence in himself. - Yeah. - Give any more thought to that job offer? - Yeah, as a matter of fact, I have, a lot. I think I want in. - That's terrific, I couldn't be more pleased. What's this with you and Jamie? - What do you mean, what's this? I think she's terrific. I don't know why you never introduced me to her before. - Well, I was saving her for somebody better. - Well, thanks, Stanley, I'll tell her. - Actually, I'd prefer this conversation was just between you and me. (ominous music) I don't think that you're right for her, Robin. - What are you talking about? - Look, you're a lot of fun, and I love you, but as far as women are concerned, I wouldn't wish you on anyone. - Now, let me get this straight. You asked me to babysit your son for the summer, show him the ropes, but I'm not good enough for your niece? - Well, maybe it's a double standard, but I didn't make it. - She's 30 years old, I think she can make up her own mind. - I'm telling you what I feel. Now if you're gonna be working for me, you better get used to the way I operate. - Well, then I guess I'm not workin' for you. - Don't get hasty, just calm down. - Look, is this a real job offer, or not? I mean, if I'm so screwed up, why do you want me workin' for you in the first place? - Because you're very good at certain things. There are other things I'd rather you leave alone. Now just lighten up, will you? We'll talk in a week, okay? (hand claps) (traffic whooshes) - My God. It's a pool shop. - Yeah, I knew there was one around here someplace. - Well what'd you do, throw out Darryl and Willard with the rest of the junk? - (laughing) Nah, they're working. I gave 'em most of my route. - (laughing) You're kidding. Some of your customers are gonna be in for a few surprises. You busy? - Just goin' over the books, why, what's up? Oh, nothin', just hadn't heard from ya in a while, thought I'd drop by, see how you're doin'. - Well, uh, I've discovered that I'm doing exactly the same as I was seven years ago. (laughs) No, that's not really true. Um, actually, I've increased my yearly overall profits by a whopping 142 dollars, 50 cents. Not bad after seven years, huh? - Gee, Robin, I didn't know you were in this for the money. - (laughing) Yeah, that's right, Mikey. Mr. Good Times, huh? - Is that why you haven't been around? You're worried about the business? - Partly, I dunno. Maybe the pressure to always have a good time is gettin' to me. - You know what's wrong with you, don't you? You're turning into one of those people you used to warn me about, you know? Dead in the water before they're 35. And lucky for you, I've got the cure. - Yeah, what? - A ball game. (Robin laughs) Brad has got great seats. - No, man, I can't. - Well, why not, what is it, Jamie? - No, no, I just gotta finish inventory. - You can finish inventory anytime. We're talkin' Dodgers here. The Pacoima Girls' Glee Club is singing the National Anthem. It's sweat sock night. - Sweat sock night? - Sweat sock night. - Who they playin'? (upbeat music) (men talking excitedly at once) - [Steve] 14 to two, 14 to two. - Iced. - God, you sure know how to pick 'em, buddy. - Thank you, Steven. - Great sweat socks, would you like some sweat socks? (men talking and laughing at once) - [Michael] Oh, you still work for that guy? I love comin' to this place. - You're the best part of-- - No, never, never, never. (all talking at once) - [Michael] Robin's the only guy in the United States that loves this place. - Cause they got the greatest hats, best thing goin'. - [Steve] This was a great idea, Brad. Comin' down here was-- - First time Robin and I ever came down here was when we double-dated in high school. We came down here because we thought it would be cheap. (all laugh) - Keep 'em cheap. - We had two girls here, they come in, and they ordered tacos. - [Robin And Michael] Tacos Langosta. - Tacos what? - You know it's, it's - [Michael And Brad] Lobster tacos. - $14.95 a piece, we ended up-- (Robin and Michael talk at once) - I mean, Mikey and I, we can go back to doing take-out again, but next time you eat first. It was like, crazy. (laughing) - You know what you do, before the summer ends, fly up to Pismo for a clambake. - No no no no, no no no no, 'cause you still have to (mumbles). In fact, no no, you remember Slick? (all laugh) The girl that took us down to Calumet. - You liked her, too, don't tell me you didn't. - I swear to God, she called me up last week, and she said, "There's still a lot of whitewater," (all laugh) "Left up here, so come on up!" - Come on, come on (hands clap) let's go, then. - Let's go, let's go. - We'll drive there tomorrow. - [Michael] So what do you think, Robin? - Ah, guys, I think, I think I gotta think about it. (all protest at once) - You need four guys to man the waft, raft. - [Steve] What are you gonna, you gonna break up this family? - Waft? - Raft. - Raft. - What are you gonna do, break up the family? - No, no, there's only one thing. That this time, you remember not to leave the cooler in the car. (all grumble and laugh) - [Brad] Yeah! (crickets chirp) (door slams) (dog barking) (doorbell chimes) - Hello. - Hello. - I was beginning to worry about you. - Here I am. - How was the game? - [Robin] Dodgers lost. - [Jamie] How are the guys? - Guys are fine. - How were your seats? - Seats were fine. Sat behind first base. - How's your mood? - Fine, why? - I dunno, you just seem a little bit distant. - I'm fine. Don't look at me so closely, huh? - Okay. Do you wanna talk? - About what? - Anything, I don't know. - Do you mind givin' me a little breathin' room, Jame? - I guess you don't wanna talk. - No, sometimes I just feel like being quiet, that's all. - Okay. You be quiet, and I'm gonna go back to bed. - I don't like feelin' responsible for your happiness. - What are you talking about? - (sighing) Ah, nothing, forget it. - Robin, since when did I ever make your responsible for me? - Jamie, when we went to Catalina, I couldn't have a good time, 'cause I was worried about you havin' a good time. I go to the ball game, and I'm worried about you because you're worried I'll be home late. - Well, you really wanna start a fight, don't you? - No, you wanted to talk, I'm talkin'. - [Jamie] I don't call this talking. - What do you call this? - Arguing. - Swell, why don't I just go home. - [Jamie] Fine, do whatever you want. - What, you're mad now? - Robin, do me a favor, and don't make me the villain in this. - Why, so you can make me one? All I said is, I'm goin' home. - Good, go home. Nobody is forcing you to stay here. And if you feel like you're missing out on life by being with me, then don't be with me, and do whatever you wanna do. - That's not the problem. - Well, what is the problem? - I don't know. You wanted to talk, you're the one who's pushin' it. - Robin, I can't spend the rest of my life trying to read your mind. If you can't articulate it, then it's your problem. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine! (door opens and slams) (hand slams) (dog barks) (upbeat pop music) ♪ Your words are in my head ♪ (door slams) ♪ Your words are ♪ - Whoa, ha, I wasn't expecting you back so soon. - Believe it or not, sometimes I do like to say in my own place. - Okay, fine. We'll vacate. - I'll be back a little later, all right? ♪ The silent scream ♪ ♪ Of no one's left ♪ - Hi. - Well, Ann, if I had have known it was gonna be you, I might have changed the sheets. - Oh no, don't be silly. They were fine. - I'll bet. (door opens and slams) - What's with him? - I don't know, hold this. Robin? (door opens) Hey, Robin. Hey. Hey, hold on. - What the hell do you think you're doin'? - (scoffs) I'm havin' a good time, what do you think? - You have really turned into a little jerk, haven't ya? - What's your problem? (footsteps clicking) What, is every girl your personal property or what? - What did you learn, Justin? - What are you doing? - What did you learn? - Let him go, let him go. I'm leaving. (car door slams) (engine revs) (sad music) (television chatters) (knob clicks) (romantic music) - Hey, one clam chowder, here. - Thanks. Join me? - Yeah, I guess so. It's not too crowded. - Do you want a cracker? (imitates parrot squawking) (both laugh) - Very funny. - So, what have you been up to? - Nothin' much. Can't believe it's almost the end of summer. - Yeah. - I was seeing somebody for a while. - What happened? - He went back to New York. That's where he's from. - Gonna go back there and visit him. - I would, but uh, I don't think his wife would be real crazy about that idea. - Sandy, Sandy. - I know. - You're broken-hearted. - No, I'm just mad. - Why, 'cause he went back? - No, because I miss him. - Did you expect something was gonna come of it? - Got used to havin' him around. You know, there are so many jerks out there. When you meet somebody who's halfway decent, you hope. - Why do women put up with men? - 'Cause we're nice guys, that's why. 'Cause there are only so many movies you can go see with your girlfriends. - You're a nice person, Sandy. - Thanks for noticing. (ominous music) Hello, you. - Hi. - Thank you. (lips smack) See ya. (car door slams) (engine revs) - [Robin] Jamie! (engine revs) (tires screech) (engine revs) (tires screeching) Ow! (doorbell chimes) (knocking on door) Jamie! (dog barking) (bangs on door) Jamie? (starter turning engine) (hand thuds) Start! (engine rumbles) (birds chirp) Hey. You wouldn't know where your cousin is, would you? - No. Somethin' the matter? - No. - Hey, Robin, wait a second. - Justin, I'm sorry about last night. It was me, it had nothing to do with you. I was all screwed up. - No sweat, I was just wondering if you could move payday up to Wednesday instead of Friday. - Why, what's up? - I'm leavin' on Thursday. You know, for college? - Right. Right, uh, Yale. - Princeton. - Princeton. - Yeah. Looks like you'll be alone on your routes now. - Mm-hm. (engine rumbles) - I thought you might like to know. Carol and I had a real long talk last night. You know what's amusing about this? I've been paying you every month. - Mr. Kampion-- - Shut up. You're such filthy scum. I almost feel sorry for you. So from now on, you stay the hell away from here. Because you don't work here anymore. Is that understood? Good. (glass shattering) Now get away from my house. (engine revs) - Can I explain? - [Jamie] Go ahead. - Where you been? - I had an appointment with a gallery in Santa Barbara. - Been lookin' all over town for ya. - So what is it you wanna say to me? - That I'm sorry, that I'm an idiot. That I made a mistake, that my life's a mess. That I love you, believe it or not. - You just can't stand to be alone for more than two minutes can you? - Jamie, I've been alone in front of your house for two hours. - Good for you, Robin, you're really making strides. - Don't shut me out. I need to talk to ya. - Robin, I can trust you about as far as I can kick your butt across this yard. Which doesn't sound like a bad idea. - That girl is someone I met before I ever met you, Jamie. Not that it matters. - That girl is not the problem. And neither are the guys, or what you do for a living, or me. You are the problem, Robin. And one of these days you're gonna realize that. And you're gonna take a good, long look at yourself. And then you'll know what you really want. - I want you. (sad music) Don't walk away, Jamie. I just want you to understand me a little bit. - I understand you a lot, Robin. (door opens) (door slams) - Well. - Well. (laughs) It's been a great summer. I appreciate all you did for me, thanks. - Comin' back next summer? Nah, probably go to Europe. (birds chirping) I'll write to you, Robin. - Yeah, lemme know what's goin' on. - I will. - [Robin] Justin. - What do you say, champ? - [Justin] How you doin', Dad, good. - Got a sec? - What's up? - Well, that's what I'd like to find out. - What do you mean? - (clicks tongue) Look, I know we had a little misunderstanding when I said that you weren't right for Jamie, but it turns out that I was right. So give me credit for knowing you. In about three weeks, I'm opening up a major new shopping development, and I'd like you to come in on it with me. What do you think? - I think I don't want you to bankroll me. I think it's about time I did somethin' on my own. - Oh come on, Robin, you're acting like a kid. - You just don't get it, do you, Stan? - Yeah, I get it. And you'll find yourself another girl, you always do. - You know, Stan, the only thing sadder than what I am is what you are. (engine revs) - [Michael] Got a card from Justin yesterday. - [Robin] Yeah, what'd he have to say? - Yo Mikey, they're workin' me hard here, the weather's cold, and the food mediocre. But I'm having fun despite it all. Thank God Princeton went co-ed. Say hi to the guys for me, and tell Robin, he can have the dungarees I left in his truck. Dungarees? Sounds like he's havin' a good time. - Yeah. - Why don't you marry the girl, Robin, and make yourself miserable forever? - You know, I think I would, Mikey. But I've tried. Uh, flowers, letters, big shiny objects, girl just doesn't want me in her life. - Yeah, well, I know how it is, I've been there. - You've been there every other day. You practically live there. - You know what you need? - What? - Aspen. I heard there was an early snow. Brad can get a plane, and we can be up there on the slopes by this time tomorrow. - Not what I need. I'll see you around, huh? - Hey. How come every time I see you, you're leaving? - Hiya, Kelli. - Hi. Just got some cold cuts and things, I thought we might have something to eat. - Nah, I gotta go. - Got some fresh pumpernickel. Actually, what I wanted to tell you is that I have some vacation time coming, and I was thinking on going to Europe. Well, I can get flight passes for free, and once you get there, I know a lot of places you can stay for practically nothing, and. - Sounds good. - So, you wanna go? - What about Michael? - Well, Michael and I, we've, you know, kinda come to the end. - I hope you didn't spend a lot on the groceries. - (laughs) We'd have a really good time, come on. - Nah, probably cramp your style. Send me a postcard, huh?
