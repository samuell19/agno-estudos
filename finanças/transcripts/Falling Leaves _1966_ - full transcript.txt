FALLING LEAVES A film by Otar Iosseliani THURSDAY You can't leave without eating. How does it look? Why do you put that black shirt? Don't annoy your father. I ironed a white shirt. - Eat. - I'm eating! I'm eating, papa! - Have some bread. - I don't want to. You hear what you're told? Wake up! You could shine your shoes. - There! - And the other? You're incorrigible. Button up! I'm ashamed to walk with you. Hands out of your pockets. Lower your collar. Hold the papers. It's for your benefit. No less than 6 photos. Head straight. Nijaradze! Hello. Excuse me. You wish? - Passport. - Right away. Where can we find the director? The return of the price drop allowed in this five year period a saving of 2 million rubles... I forbade giving wine to individuals! He asked me, I couldn't refuse. When will you obey my orders? May we interrupt? Four measly decaliters! You find that little? Let me talk to these persons. You have any diplomas? Let me speak to them. Any commendation? Very good. Average. A pen. - No sports'? - No. I'm good at billiards. - And cards? - Sometimes. - Drink? - Sometimes. Well. And you? I don't drink, don't gamble. To the lab. And you, the cellar. We begin right away?. Begin. Our collective will please you, they're young and healthy. Your turn. All the jars you gave me were cracked. You can check. - I saw it, but... - What, but? I didn't dare tell you. Why?. I was troubled. I'll go down, return, and talk about it. Hello. Recognize me? We live on the same street. At aunt Nina's? - You work here? - You can tell? We're sent to your place. Good luck. Greetings to aunt Nina. I'm sent as technician to shop n°1. It's here? He's accusing us of selling wine? We'll look into it. Let's get over that. Is this shop n°1? I'll handle it. He's got worries and is nervous. No shortage of work here. The main thing is to impress the workers. A worker is a worker. He likes serious people. One must be strict. He saw me? My dear friend, it's been so long! It's too small! It's all I have. Take care of our friend. Who is he? A pain. A leech. Comrades, you're in an avant-garde company. Our cellars are from 1789. We reproduce great wines and table wines... Where's my brush? Why do you ask me? I have to scrub with my hands? Not that one. Mine is shorter. Look over there. On the right, in the corner. In this cellar, wine is clarified and aged. All this is your domain. You have to decide. Leave that. Take your coat off and bring another barrel. I'll take it. Thank you very much. - Are you tired? - Not at all. Did you see that beggar? The fifth time he comes. No scruples. What is your name? Niko. To your health, young man. It has matured. Your family name? Nijaradze. Alexander, who was he to you? My father. A good man. - You're alone here? - Yes. May I entertain you? - You think You can? - Then, try. What are you doing tonight? This one's cracked. - You like me? - Yes. Sign the receipt. - Can we talk? - Let's close the door. That's it? One moment. Put that down. - What is it? - A ball. Your first day at work, you play with a ball? It's the break. Think of your reputation. They'll make fun of you. Put your smock. Show your hands. You push barrels! Wait for me outside. I can't go in with you. I'm busy. Think a bit. Don't be naive. Here, it's a company... I'm off. It's not my business, but I wanted to warn you. Beware of your boss. He's not straight. I know a lot about him. It's none of your business. No, it's true. A guy is coming. Let's talk of something else. So, I warned you. Hello. Recognize me? Hello. Hello again! - Out For a walk? - Yes. Have a cup of coffee? You think they will come and serve you? - Two coffees. - Sit down, I'll call you. It's taken. - It's free? - Go ahead. Any matches? For whom, the two coffees? - How old are you? - Oh, I'm old. Come near. You know this blonde? No. Look at her. Don't worry. You're shy... You're not fast! What is it? - Who is this guy? - A colleague. Watch out. It can't go on! Leave me, please. - Excuse us, we disturbed you? - She wasn't bad. Are you hurt? - Or did you come on her? - Come on her, it can hurt him. - She has friends? - Leave him alone. He can feel hurt. - Who hurt him? - Us. He was with a young girl. If I hurt you, forgive me. You really are hurt? - Who is this guy?. - An imbecile. He's chasing that girl. WEDNESDAY Tomorrow, we bottle barrel 49. May we taste? Of course! If you have a strong belly! So? Not so sure. - We're putting that in bottles? - I Have No say. It's undrinkable! Lucky you're here! Without you, we were done for! We have to meet the plan with this year's wine. Last year's crop. You know the parameters. I'm listening. For me, it's perfectly matured. It's true it has a taste of wild pear. Maybe, but what I like is the color. The color, fine, but the bouquet? If we talk bouquet, not great. Not great, fine. You decide. Enough talk. We have no choice. How much can we bottle? Barrel 47 is empty. Tomorrow, we start on 49. - So, the plan? - It will be reached. Who has anything to add? Meeting adjourned. 49 cannot be bottled. The wine is bad. What's with this wine? It's blurry and too much alcohol. For a dry wine, it would do. But it's a Saperavi. It will do for the Saperavi. What do you suggest? Adding gelatin. It will take two weeks. We stop the factory?. We have to wait. We had a good laugh with you. The wine of 49 is not a Saperavi yet. - If only I said what I thought... - Why not say what one thinks? You are free. You two, stay. You know the plan depends on you? Did you hear? I know what Saperavi is. But one must go beyond. Forget these niceties. Back to work. These cellars date to 1789. Here, we hold wines of Georgia of all ages. Wine, like man, ages and... dies. Don't touch. Take this! Open the faucet! First, agree you two. One says open, the other don't. Conscience is a good thing. Wine like this, my grandfather used it for vinegar. He's right. Know how much it will cost us? What's the fuss? He won't sign. Can we work like this? - You won't sign? - I can't. - Why?. - I won't sign. This is our main shop. It always surpasses the plan. These big barrels are called casks. Our head oenologist. These young ones are technicians. The quality of the wine depends on their work. Take them away quickly. We'll give them to drink. Hurry, we're busy. What are you giving them? That one. You will taste a natural red wine. It's too much. Drink what you can. This comrade is not with us. - What is this cheap wine? - Drop it. Who wants some more? - May we sing? - As much as You want. And you, comrade, come to the director's. SAT U R DAY Come down! - What is it? - Come down! You fight when you're drunk? Chicken, lamb... I don't recommend the chachlik. - And the appetizers? - Everything is good. Chicken for all. - And For the wine? - Some white And Saperavi. Bring us a bottle to see. It's good. Bring it anyways. Ours. Of March 25th. We're off. Pity. What can we do? Go to my place! What wine do You have? Real wine. I want to quit smoking, I can't. I'm expected at home. My children... Children, you understand. Where were you? Meet my boss. You were drinking again. We were just smoking. Come in, or I lock you out. I don't know what's with her. Excuse me. Coming, yes or no? SUNDAY Behave, I'll come back for you. I interrupted you, go on. - Do You like it? - Yes. Then the director said... You're not interested? On the contrary, it's fascinating. Where were you? May I introduce Niko. Excuse us. - Do You know?. - Of course. Who'd have thought? I saw her yesterday, didn't notice anything. - Who did You pick up? - What's it to you? That one, she knows all the gossip. Go on. You were talking about wine. I didn't understand a word. The wine is bad, and they want my signature. - You're always so serious? - Why?. You made us wait! I was held up. I forgot, we're going somewhere. - Coming with us? - No, thanks. WEDNESDAY Don't meddle with my things. I didn't forget you drink, play cards and were a bad student. Don't play the righter of wrongs. I had to warn you. Do what you're told! I waited for your call. Don't tell me lies! Is it so hard to grant me a moment? Call me tonight, we'll see. You're not very smart. With him, one has to trick. - What is your name? - Niko. He too, he drinks and plays cards, understood? Good luck! Straightened you out? Excuse me, you're a bit strange. Wake up. These are not times to have principles. Things are not that simple. You're young, you lack experience. You're made fun of, yelled at. You like that? I doubt it. If you insist, you'll be sorry. Of course, I know you're right. But believe me, you'll get nowhere. Nothing can be done, that's the way it is. SUNDAY He sends you a kid. - What kid? - A redhead. Call a bit later. He says come down. I'm busy. I'm listening. It's not true! Come, we'll talk here. He wants to talk seriously. Hello, Otar! I was just thinking of you. I miss you. Want to come and see me? I'd like that. I'll wait for you. - Just playing. - What are You up to? He's still there? On the spot. - What's it to you? - Where are You going? - To a comrade's. - Where are You going? On the first floor? Go, scram! Where are you going, honey?. Nowhere. What a chicken. That one, where's he from? - Madly. - He loves you? You don't go up. Beat it! - Where are you going, my friend? - To Marina's. You remember me? I warned you. Hello, my boy. - How is mama? - Not very well. Blood pressure? She saw the doctor and... What's wrong with him? He's in a hurry. - What happened? - I don't know. I came to see you. Come in. He's sweet. My friend likes you. Ask him if he likes me. He's shy. He likes me, but says nothing. It's true? He says nothing. How tall he is! Does he play basketball? No, I don't play. A pity. He's intelligent and has principles. You're lucky! Help me a bit. I don't have time. Niko, help us. Sit down. Do you know how to sing? Sing then. I don't sing. She's not there. Otar, where are you? I'm busy. Call me tomorrow. Why do you rise? Let's sing together. I have to leave. You're in a hurry?. I'll accompany him and come back. No need to. So nothing will happen to him. - Where are You running to? - I don't run. Come here. It's not on my way. You, beat it! What did he do to you? Let us talk. You, shut up. Don't touch. You see, he's a kid. - What is he doing here? - Nothing. Let him go. Let me go. Rezo isn't here. Something to tell him? No need to ring, they're all out. No luck! What's wrong? I hit myself. You weren't in a fight? - You were hit? - No. How are things with you? All is well. You're not married? You are the last two. I won three bottles. Do you see the others? We should meet one day. Pick that butt up. You didn't hear me? Bum! Excuse me. Stand up. Pardon me, I didn't see. He didn't see! I'm very troubled, I beg you to listen. What do you want? Smile. Hi, boss! Strolling? - What happened to your eye? - I knocked myself. - You didn't see... - I saw no one. You're in a bad mood? See you. The salt! - You're tired? - I'm not tired! Eat, as you're told. Trouble on the job? Say something. Don't worry. "Don't worry, don't worry"! Everyday, the same song! Stand up. If you don't want to, say nothing. Leave me alone. Leave him. FRIDAY Hello. What day is it? The 12th. Tell our friends, family and friends the wine is drawn August 12 and is undrinkable. May the Lord forgive us! Why are you late? I have an excuse. Write an explanation note. For the director, or I count it as an absence. It's the last time! I wanted to say... Don't worry. What is it? He's an old friend. I have guests today. It's not papa's inn, here! We don't give him anything! Who are you? Not a drop, or you will be in trouble! We could make a deal... Orders from the top. Not a drop. - What are you doing here? - Resting. Come with me.
