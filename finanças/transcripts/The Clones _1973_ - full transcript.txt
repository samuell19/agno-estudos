[Narrator] On August 5th, 1972, Senator John Tunney wrote in the Saturday Review. Cloning, asexual laboratory duplication of frogs, has already been successful. The technology for the cloning of mammals will be available within five years. Unless research is stopped, the technology for the cloning of human beings might be available within anything from 10 to 25 years. (eerie music) [Man] Yankee Sister, this is Echo Delta. Subject is descending to laboratory, over. [Man] We copy Echo Delta. Maintain surveillance. (machine whirring) (machines clacking and beeping) [Man] Yankee Sister, Echo Delta. Subject is activated pre-stage in oscillator. Yankee Sister, Echo Delta. Subject is programming fusion generator. Stand by for malfunction. We're leaving vicinity, out. (machines beeping and humming) (buzzing) (machines beeping wildly) (exploding) (high pitched whining) (whining ceases) (muffled shouting) Hey, goddamnit that's my car! Hey! What are you doing back there? Did you see my car come through here? Sure I saw your car come through here. Well then why the hell didn't you stop? Your car went by there and you waved at me. For Christ's sake it wasn't me! Oh no... Oh I just had my car stolen! Now I need another one. Get on the phone! Yes sir. - Janet, you in there? - Yeah, what'd you forget? Get the university on the phone, will you please? My god Gerry, what happened? Can you get me the university on the phone please? [Janet] Who do you want to talk to? Fred Kalif. Again? What is it, security? What do you mean again? You came in here before and you talked to Fred on the phone. When I was here the last time did I have my car with me? Of course you had your car. You mean somebody was here that looked exactly like me, so much like me that he fooled you? Gerry, nobody fooled me. You came in here before, you talked to Fred, and you left in a rush. Let me take a look at this scar. What happened to you? You say he had my car? No Gerry, you had your car. That's impossible, Janet. How many years have you worked for me? For three and a half years. Gerry, let me call Dr. Burns... No no no no, it's okay. Just take the afternoon off, Janet. Janet? Don't say anything about this to anybody until I get it cleared up, okay? Okay Gerry. Are you sure you're gonna be okay? [Gerry] I hope so. Come on, who is this? What do you mean who is this? It's me, Gerry. You can't be Gerry. This some kind of a joke? Who are you anyway? Okay Penny. Just hang on, I'll be right over. (doorbell rings) You were so strange with me on the phone. What's wrong? Why is my Mercedes parked outside? Gerry! Gerry! Gerry. Yes honey? Who are you? I'm Dr. Appleby, who are you? What do you mean, Dr. Appleby? Call security honey. I'll take that. Penny this man is an imposter. He's not me. Hold it. Make the call. I don't know who you are but you better leave her alone. Leave her alone? You get out of this house! It's my house. [Gerry] Penny this man's not me! You're absolutely right, I'm not you. Chris, you better get over here right away. What? [Penny] There's a man in the house and he looks just like Gerry and he's trying to hurt him. You stole my face, my car, my wallet, my clothes and now my girl! Well I got two of 'em back. I'll be back for the other three. (whirring) [Tom] What's this all about, George? As far as I know Tom, it's high priority. Some guy is impersonating a scientist in a security project. Priority one? Right. That means it's a hit. My hit. You can have it, George. Okay. [Tom] Who is he impersonating? [George] Gerry Appleby's the guy's name, he's some scientist. I don't know that much about him. Ha. Will the real Gerry Appleby stand up? (laughs) - And be shot! - And be shot! (laughing) (eerie music) (siren wailing) Hi officer. Driver's license, please. Sure. What's the trouble? Step out of the car please. Uh, what's the problem? Move! Sure. Can I have my wallet back? Spread your legs and put your hands against the trunk. Oh come on, we don't have to go through all that stuff. You cops are really weird. Put your left arm behind your back. Come on you don't have to handcuff me, I told you. Right hand please. Okay what are the charges? I got a right to know, what are the charges? You have the right to remain... Yeah I know, I have the right to remain silent. What are the charges? [Man] Yankee Sister, this is Blue Nose Four. Port arrival at Frasier Park. Request instructions, over. [Man] Roger, Blue Nose Four. Subject is being held at Frasier Park substation. Proceed to that location and take custody, over. [Man] Will do, Yankee Sister. Nose Four out. (muffled speaking on police radio) Capital A-P-P-L-E-B-Y. Dr. Gerald Appleby. Tom Sawyer. Fred Moore, how do you do? How are you Fred? I'm George Nemo. Did you book him? [Fred] No not yet, we were waiting for instruction. [Tom] That's good, 'cause he's no common criminal. - Finish the report? - No not yet. (keyboard clacking) (mumbling) (laughing) Gentlemen, the report is ready. - Oh. - Okay good. Sign right here please. Okay. That's it, wallet, car keys. Okay, good. - Okay, got the cuffs? - Yeah. You don't have to put cuffs on me, I'll go quietly. Alright. You don't have to put the cuffs on me! Just make it easy on yourself, huh pal? Take it easy. Let's go. Listen, you're making a big mistake. Okay friend, come on. There's somebody impersonating me, you should arrest them! - Thanks a lot Fred. - You're very welcome. [Tom] Thank you Fred! You'll be getting a letter from the director in a couple of weeks. We'll give you a little boost. This is absurd! My name is Dr. Gerald Appleby, I'm not a criminal. - Come along doctor. - Let's go, doc. Boy am I glad to see you. This is getting ridiculous. Have a seat. Fred, somebody's impersonating me. Stole my wallet, my car, my identity. Did you go straight home? The whole project could be in danger! My life could be in danger. [Fred Kalif] Did you talk to anybody before you went home? Yeah, I talked to the guard, he was gonna call. What are you asking a lot of stupid questions for, Fred? Never mind that, now will you answer my question? Get on the phone and call Penny, she was right there with me. I don't need to call Penny. (buzzes) You gonna pull that same crap on me too, that I'm me and he's him? I know who you are. Maybe you'd like to take my fingerprints, Fred. I don't need to take your fingerprints. It would be a lot easier on you if you cooperate. Cooperate? (exciting music) Get him! The accelerator's overheating, everybody out! (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (gentle music) Good one. Here's to a very strange afternoon. Gerry. You knew my phone number, my address. I had the feeling that you knew things about me that only you could know. Will you kiss me? (phone ringing) Oh my gosh. I gotta answer it, honey. Hello? Yeah Fred. No I haven't. What do you mean? No, come on. Well yeah, okay. Okay. Why would he want me to do that? Do what? Kill him. Said he escaped and if he shows up here I should kill him. Gerry, I'm scared. Well there's no reason to be scared. Why would he come back here? He's on the run. They want him dead and they know why he was here. I got an idea. Who are you calling? Carl Swafford. Well in theory, yes. But in our present state of technology for embryo fertilization and actual uterine development simply precludes any such possibility. Yes, I'm absolutely certain. There's a great deal of difference between frogs and humans. I must go now. Yes, yes, talk to you later, I call you, bye. Gerry. Carl, thank god somebody recognizes me. Of course I recognize you. What's wrong? I'm in a lot of trouble, Carl. - You heard about it? - No. Please, sit down, please, please. There's somebody that looks exactly like me. [Carl] Exactly like you? Yeah it's almost as though it's out of the fourth dimension. And somebody tried to kill me this morning, Carl. You? That could be serious. - Of course. - A possible breakdown in our security. [Gerry] You might not believe this Carl, but Fred Kalif set me up. This could be a problem. (mysterious music) [Gerry] The reason I came to you, is it possible that a double could be created from me somehow? A double? I don't think it's possible, do you? It's probably some kind of mistake. Yes. Everything is just fine. (intense music) (screaming) (high pitched whining) (exciting music) (beeping) [Man] Blue Nose Four, this is Yankee Sister, do you read me? Over. [Man] Roger, Yankee Sister. We have the subject's laboratory escape tunnel in view. We're secure and waiting, over. [Man] Report any contact, Blue Nose Four. This is Yankee Sister, out. (buzzing) Wedding present. First anniversary. That's beautiful Sawyer, that's just beautiful. I didn't think you were that dangerous. [George] The directive said priority one. We've had those before. It's all politics, you know that. Politics or no politics, just keep your mind on your job. We're supposed to bring him in. Our job is to get him. Nemo! (gun fires) - Shit! - Come on! (intense music) (gun firing) Shit! [George] Where the hell is he? He's probably over in them bushes. See I could have got him before you stopped me. Oh, we'll get him, don't worry about it. - There we go! - There he is! Come on! (guns firing) [Tom] He's around here someplace, man. That's right. He's been running a long time, he can't just walk. Which way's the swamp? Over that way. If he gets to them swamp we've lost him. (gun firing) (suspenseful music) [Carl] There's a great deal of difference between frogs and humans. (gun fires) (ribbits) Get that son of a bitch. No, it's alright, I have to get you to a hospital. Don't let him get away! He's gotten away already. Stole your gun, smash your face up. We've lost him. Okay, come on, that's alright. Come on man, come on. (light music) Now your needs sir, what are they? Perhaps a glass of wine? You got a Percodan or a Codeine or Darvan, something for pain? (speaking foreign language) Out of beer, we're out of beer! What do you do for a living? I work at a university. Is that why they beat you up? Some friend, some duplicate mother? Where are you guys going? Wait a minute. You know, I went to a hotel my uncle Jun took me to last year when I was three. And I looked in the mirror and I walked away and I knew I didn't see a thing. I have been in so many medicine cabinets and I swear to god I look like a bottle on the pharmacy shelf. And I've gone every other route there is to go, buddy. Got it? Oh I'll give you half my habit. I'd like to get out. Son, I understand. Hey man, where you going? - Stop this goddamn bus! - Hey what's going on? (tires squealing) Hey, hey! (shouting) [Doctor] Okay nurse. Don't take the wings off of butterflies. Don't tear the wings off. [Doctor] You have a mild concussion, that's all. Where am I? In the hospital. What's your name? You have no ID on you. - I can't stay here. - What's your name? I can't stay here. Why? - I gotta go. - Why? Lie down, lie down. What's your name? Who is trying to kill me? Who's trying to kill you? I don't know. I gotta go. [Doctor] This is just a mild sedative. [Gerry] I don't need it! [Doctor] Did you check with the university nurse? [Nurse] Reception's trying university now. (voices echoing) (gentle music) [Doctor] And breathe. (gun fires) Gerry. Gerry it's me, Jim, Jim Bradigan. What the hell are you doing here? Jim. How'd you know I was here? Heard your name down at reception. [Gerry] Reception? [Jim] Yeah, I heard it when Dr. Roberts called the university. How long ago'd he call? 10 minutes. 15. I gotta get outta here. Wait a minute... - Gerry, relax. Why don't you lay down? - I gotta get outta here. - Why do you wanna get out? - 'Cause they're after me. - Who's after you? - Secret agents. CID? [Woman] Phoning Dr. Bradigan. [Jim] Gerry, what have you done? I didn't do anything. Somebody's impersonating me and they wanna get rid of me. Who would want to impersonate you, Gerry? Nobody. Impersonate me, I'm me. Why would anybody want to impersonate me? [Jim] I don't know Gerry. (sighs) Do you know Carl Swafford? [Jim] Carl Swafford, biogenetics? Yeah. Do you know anything about his research? Cloning experiments. The genetic twin. They take a cell from the lining of the stomach. In microsurgery they program personality. Physical traits, even intelligence. So my double is a clone manufactured in Swafford's lab. [Woman] Dr. James Bradigan, please call reception. Gerry, you wait right here. I'll get to the bottom of this. [Woman] Will an orderly please report to emergency? What the hell is this? You're under arrest, Dr. Bradigan. Hey you can't do that! Hold it. (suspenseful music) Biogenetics, please. Oh is Carl Swafford in? Okay no, no thank you. Yeah I'll call back. Oh, excuse me. Hey, come back here with my car! Hey! Hey! (machines whirring) (suspenseful music) There's a gun in the back here. Turn around. Go slow, I don't wanna hurt you. I don't want any hassle, don't turn around. Open it. Sorry about this. (hits) (high-pitched whining) You don't need a gun. I'll decide what I need. I know what you are. You mean who I am. You were created from a gene taken from the lining of my stomach. I have a life too, I have a memory and I have a past. Memory? You have my memory, it was programmed into you. After you had 51 days in a box like your twin brother there. (dramatic music) Have you seen enough, Gerry? Yeah I've seen enough. Drop the gun, Carl. I swear to God I'll kill you. Get in the closet. Get in the closet! You too Xerox, come on. Come on. Better do what he says, he's a maniac. (gun fires) Get in the closet, get in there! (machines whining and beeping) (banging) Hurry up, your boy needs time too! I got a very important phone call to make! [Woman] Mr. Simmons, there's a collect call - from a Gerry Appleby. - Who? [Woman] A Dr. Gerald Appleby. I'll take it now. (phone ringing) Hello? [Gerry] Phil, thank God I got you. Gerry, what is it? [Gerry] It may sound crazy but I've been cloned. You've been what? Cloned, I've been duplicated. The only things that have been cloned are - frogs and plants. - Hurry up! Hey, what's that? Hurry up will you? Nothing. Believe me, this is for real. It's Swafford's work. Swafford? He's only had that grant for two years. [Gerry] Carl Swafford, your Nobel Prize winner, has cloned me. Gerry. Have you any proof? Of course I have! I've got photographs of the second clone. I've got genetic analysis. I've even got the personality imprint diagram. Gerry, what can I do? You can help me stop them. Now look. Swafford's a very important man. He could kill your career. Career? Hell I'm concerned with my life, Phil. - Where's he calling from? - He said Santa Paula. Look okay, I'm flying to Sacramento in one hour. If you can be at the Santa Paula airport in, oh, say one o'clock? I'll sit down and have a look at this proof of yours. Okay, I'm depending on you. [Man] Blue Nose Four, Blue Nose Four, this is Tango Sierra, over. [Man] We got you Tango Sierra. How's the weather up there? [Man] We've spotted your man, headed north on Carl Canyon Road. He's driving a big black Cadillac, over. [Man] Roger, we have contact, we're in pursuit. Blue Nose Four, out. (funky music) [Man] Yankee Sister, this is Tango Sierra over. [Man] Come in Tango Sierra, over. [Man] We've spotted subject and Blue Nose Four is in pursuit, over. [Man] We copy previous transmission. Please follow pursuit and report, Tango Sierra. [Man] Roger HQ. Tango Sierra out. You think he's gonna make the airport? I don't know. (laughing) You think we'll make the airport? I'll lay you two to one, how's that? Get a shot at him, Tom. (gun fires) (laughing) (tires squealing) Look out for that post, woo! Bring him, Georgie. Get a shot at him, man. Now, now! (gun fires) (honking) (gun fires) Come on, catch up with him. We'll get him before the helicopter. (explodes) He had to have been doing over 70. I tried to avoid him, but there was no way. It's alright, he was a fugitive. You think he got out? No way. Must have rode it all the way down. What do you think? I don't know. Uh look, we're with the CID. We have a little private business down here so don't you worry about it and we'll take care of it. You won't have to fill out any forms, it's alright. - Thanks a lot. - Okay. Keep it to yourself. I'm gonna call it in. Alright. Blue Nose Four. That's right, six miles up. Top of Carl Canyon. Negative, looks like he went with it. Yeah. We'll need a helicopter to check it out. Ah. Blue Nose Four, over and out. I'll lay you two to one that son got away. Well let's hope not. If so we got two of them to catch. HQ said the clone got wise. Skipped, in hiding someplace. (scoffs) One for the money, two for the show. (laughing) Come on. [Penny] Gerry, I've been waiting for you to call. Where are you? (gentle music) - Can you meet me? - Yes. Where, when? [Gerry] Hillside, behind the old cafe off Highway 31. [Penny] Gerry, I know it's you now. That's the real thing. I know it now. You weren't so sure before. I was so confused. You didn't know who you were either. Now you seem to know. It's amazing we could even come together after what's happened. When you called I knew it was you. After being with the clone. What do you mean, being with the clone? He told me he wasn't you. He'd figured it all out. It seemed like everybody but me knew, Gerry. The clone and you and Swafford and those men chasing you. But you knew about the genetic experiments. I knew about them, but I didn't understand why, Gerry. Are you Gerry? You know there is a difference. The clone had to think about who he was. You just are. I'm finding that extremely hard to do. Oh god I love you. Where is he? After you left Swafford tried to have him arrested. I took him where we used to go. Maybe he's alright. Maybe he's not after my death. (tires screeching) Excuse me, are there any messages for Gerald Appleby? No there aren't. Mr. Simmons was supposed to arrive here about a half hour ago, any word on that? Do you know where he was originating? [Gerry] Los Angeles. I'll check. Hey buddy, you talking about Phil Simmons, HEW? Yeah. Just heard over the radio about two minutes ago he had an accident. Plane crossed over a restricted area. Missiles I think. Crashed? No. Got a heat seeker right up the exhaust. They won't find the pieces for another month. That was no accident. What are we gonna do, Gerry? I don't know, I don't know. (sighs) Are there any planes leaving here for LA International? Yeah, in about an hour. Hey listen, I'm leaving in about two minutes to LA if you want a ride. - It's very kind of you. - Sure, come on, follow me. What's your name? Gerry. Bob Brenner, how you doing? Fine, this is Penny. How you doing? I flew with a guy named Brenner once and... Hey what happened to your leg? Nothing, I'm alright. Listen, can you help me pull the plane out of the hangar? Sure. (shouting) - I'll go quietly! - Gerry! Let him go! (crying) Oh George! There's a lot at stake. You've got to stay calm, enough is enough! Take her to headquarters, he's mine! No, no please! Let me stay with him, please! - You got the cuffs? - Yes. Put 'em on. I want to stay with Gerry. - Shut up, sister. - Help me! - Silence! - No! We'll wait until you pay on time. Have a nice trip, buddy. Hold it! Not done with you yet. Come on. [Man] Yankee Sister, this is Blue Nose Four. I have subject in custody and am proceeding as instructed. Over. [Man] That's fine Blue Nose Four, please report by 1530. Yankee Sister out. (kicks) (shouts) (punching) (grunting) [Man] Blue Nose Four, this is command. If you read me switch to military frequency code whisky. Over. Blue Nose Four, Blue Nose Four... Bastard! [Man] This is Yankee Sister. Nemo do you read me? Repeat, Nemo do you read me? Over. Echo Delta this is Yankee Sister, come in please, over. [Man] This is Echo Delta, we read you Yankee Sister, over. [Man] Echo Delta, we've lost contact with Nemo and subject. Proceed to coordinates 120. An abandoned service station three miles north northeast - of Santa Paula airport. - Where is she? [Man] And report status, over. [Man] Roger Yankee Sister, coordinates 120. We'll report on arrival. Echo Delta out. Where's Penny? They took her away and they beat the hell out of me. Yeah they sure did. Here. (winces) Why didn't they just come and talk to me? Instead of trying so hard to kill me? You wouldn't go along with it, you know that. Swafford? Yeah Swafford and the military. Your questioning of the moral responsibility of the scientist doesn't fit in with their plan. You're right. Utilization of my developments in high energy fusion. Why didn't you go along with it? I don't want to be you anymore. She really thought you were me. I am you. It's the same old story. A handful of men who want to assume the power of creation. And it never works. (knocking) Hold it right there, Dr. Appleby. He's not Dr. Appleby, I am. (gate creaks) (machines beeping) All the big boys. Ling Xi, People's Republic. Alex Borsikof, Bolshevik Weather Lamps. Well they are and they aren't. Clones? - All four. - Why? Well as far as I've been able to piece it together, the project involves controlling the weather 100% in the lower atmosphere. The ultimate deterrent. Whoever controls the weather controls it all. Yeah I guess one good tidal wave is worth two, three hydrogen bombs. Ecological genocide. That's really beautiful. How come the clones? Why me? Because they need fusion reactors and you're the only man in the world who can control them. Yeah but if this lab was operating at maximum it could, what, cover a 1,000 mile radius? That's where we come in, I mean the clones. They'll be 52 stations like this all over the world. Manned by the same four scientists. What about the originals? Maybe you should check with security. Come on, let's put a stop to it. Seal off the door. I'm gonna turn on the hydrogen. (beeping) What a terrible waste, my friend. Please. Boy are you tenacious. Why don't you give it up? The clones are dead, the project's over. Don't be silly, my boy. I have a thousand cells in cold storage. Each a duplicate of the men you saw. Delayed, perhaps. Finished, no. Please, we go now. Please. (hits) (shouts) Where's Penny? Where is she? I don't know. Come on fat boy, where is she? CID headquarters. - Where? - I don't know. [Gerry] Where? At the end of Highway 41. (upbeat music) (tense music) Where the hell are they? You know it's a total violation, a violation of 47, section B. You know that don't you, didn't you remember that? I sent you both out together. You told me to leave. You told me to bring her back. [Man] Oh sure. - Who? - Nemo. - George. - Oh, I see. You take your orders from Nemo now. [Tom] We are on the case together. That's right, and you're supposed to come back together. [Tom] We're not wrapped, we're still there. See that? Sir? [Man] Yankee Sister, this is Tango Sierra. Yankee Sister, this is Tango Sierra. Do you read me, over. [Man] Tango Sierra this is Yankee Sister. Do you have a location on subject? Over. [Man] Negative Yankee Sister. We've covered coordinates four, 13, and 12. That's one three and one two. There's no sign of Appleby, over. (exciting music) [Man] Tango Sierra, you are directed to check coordinate four niner and report, over. [Man] We're on our way HQ. This is Tango Sierra out. Must have been 45 minutes ago, maybe an hour. Somebody's coming now, I'll go check. [Man] This is Foxtrot field HQ request instructions, over. [Man] We copy Foxtrot, you are to move all agents and crew to location A in one five minutes, over. [Man] Can you lighten up on the noise just a little? This signal's weak enough. [Man] Yankee Sister this is Tango. We have four niner and holding, over. Want some coffee? No. No coffee. Is Jerry alive? [Tom] I don't know. How come you don't know? Like they say, no news is good news. [Penny] Is that what they say? Yeah, that's what they say. Maybe I could talk to someone in there. Could you let me go in there? No, I think you better stay in here. What did we do that caused all these horrible things to start happening to us? He was a spy, that's why. Gerry's not a spy. And all the... You don't understand it. I don't understand it, no I don't. Would you like a sandwich or something? Maybe you should go. (crying) I want you to stay. What kind of tack is that? You don't want coffee, you don't want a sandwich, you don't want me to go. What do you want? I don't want you to go back there, I don't want to be alone. Why don't you take the coffee? It's something. Okay. Yankee Sister this is Tango. (exciting music) Foxtrot has a visitor. Nemo's vehicle with subject at wheel is headed for the main gate and he ain't stopping to chat, over. [Man] Continue report Tango, over. (guns firing) [Man] You have contact, I repeat, you have fire contact. [Man] Tango this is Foxtrot. Are you reporting security penetration, over. [Man] Stand by Foxtrot. [Man] Tango Sierra this is Yankee Sister. Can you make an ID? Repeat, do you have an ID, over. [Man] Affirmative Yankee Sister. Two men, looks like subject and you may not believe this but it looks like subject's twin brother. [Man] Foxtrot, Foxtrot, proceed with evacuation. Repeat, execute evacuation immediately. [Man] Foxtrot this is Yankee Sister... - Key, handcuffs! - Over. Foxtrot, Foxtrot, do you read me? Over. Come on. [Man] Yankee Sister to Foxtrot, Yankee Sister to Foxtrot, come in Foxtrot, over. Where'd he go? Headquarters, headquarters. (suspenseful music) [Man] Yankee Sister this is Tango. Y'all got a mess down there. Two Foxtrot units are split and under fire, over. (guns firing) [Man] Foxtrot, do you read me damnit, do you read me? [Man] Foxtrot, Foxtrot. Take Janet and run. [Man] Okay, Foxtrot this is Yankee Sister. Damnit please report in. (suspenseful music) (gun fires) Damnit Tom, what's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? Listen man, we got a job to do. Now you better get this chick out of your head. Remember Hillary and your job! Don't worry about that. What's the matter with you, are you crazy? Look, you got a career man. Don't blow it over this chick. She means nothing. She's a job like every other one! We're gonna arrest her, that's all we're gonna do. Now just stay out of this! If you can't handle it emotionally stay out of it! If I can't handle it? Don't do it man. Kill the guy. Get lost! (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (breathing heavily) (gentle music) (exciting music) (guns firing) (eerie music) (groaning) (machines buzzing) Carl. Carl. Gerry you don't. (gun firing) Gerry you don't understand. Don't understand. What a waste.
