Yes, mom, I'm getting off the train, right now. Okay, I told you I would call you when I got to the rental place. Mom, it's only for two weeks. I'm sure you and dad will be fine. Yes, I know it's our busy season, mom. Yes, but you're also the one who told me that I needed a vacation, so here I am. Yes, I will keep my receipts, don't worry. Fine love you, too... Frank! Frank! Shoot... Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Down! He got away from me, I'm sorry. It's okay. It's... it's okay. You all right, Mozart? Mozart? Yes, after the composer. I know who Mozart is. I'm sure you do. No offense. You okay, Mozart? Is this mean dog scaring you? Frank's not really mean. Frank? Yeah, after the singer. Well, anyway... Excuse me. Hope you have a nice day. You too. You're not really mean, are you, Frank? No, you're not. Let's go. It should have wireless capabilities. Electric, obviously. And if it has a sunroof, it should have a uv coating on the interior of the glass as well. Excuse me for a second. Hi, honey. I'm just getting my rental car. Electric? Obviously. UV? You know how you burn. I'm not going to be outside that much anyway. I have two weeks to finish my thesis. Well, I'm glad to hear that. You really need to focus, Spencer. My father doesn't give out these grants to just anybody. I know. I wi promise. Okay, I've gotta go. Call me later. I wi love... You. That's my girlfriend. She worries. This place is so beautiful. No wonder you love living here. Well, I can't wait to see you. How long has it been? Since your wedding, right? A whole year? That's crazy. We've got a lot of catching up to do. Yes, just let me get settled in at the house, and then we'll go out, okay? First Margarita's on me. About that. What? come on, don't tell me you've changed that much since college. Like I said, we've got a lot of catching up to do. I'll see you later. Okay, see you later. Do you believe it, Frank? This whole place is ours, just us, two whole weeks. This is amazing, Frank. Do you see this? My gosh... Look at this view... Didn't look this big on the website. Frank... Come here. Frank... They must have a big family. This is nice. What, not up to your standards? Now, this is more like it? Yeah. I think it's exactly what we need. Now, while that's chilling, let's go take some shots outside. Come on, Frank. All right, Mozart, this is home for the next two weeks. Isn't that thoughtful. It's good, too. Deserves a better glass than this. How about this one? No? Yeah. Anybody could've taken this. Maybe that's my problem. What do you think, Mozart? How do you like the place? What's wrong with you? What? What's wrong with you? Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! -You! -you! What's your dog doing in my house? What's your cat doing in my house? Actually, what are you doing in my house? That's an easy one. It's not your house, it's mine. Come on, Mozart. Let's get you somewhere safe, away from that animal. He has a name. That's okay, you're not a mean dog. No, you're not... It's fine, buddy. Please don't be scratched. Please don't be scratched... It took me an entire year to find this album. Can't you just download it? It's not the same. It's like the difference between the sunshine and a tanning bed. Okay... Would you like to tell me what you and your dog are doing here? Look, all I know is that I rented this house for spring break. See? I had to fill out this whole questionnaire. And then I go out to walk my dog, and I come back, and I find you, here, drinking my wine. I picked it up on the way here. I thought it was a gift from the rental company. I... filled out the same questionnaire. Starting today. Starting today. Well, obviously, there's been some sort of mistake. Obviously. But I don't know how. It was a very personal questionnaire. They seemed to have every other detail covered. I mean, "favorite color," "favorite food," "favorite movie..." What did you answer for food? Italian. Me too. Favorite movie? "Casablanca." Me too. Well, maybe they thought we were the same person? Same reservation and canceled the other one? Yeah. Laura Haley. I'm sorry? Well, if we're going to be stuck in the same boat, we'd better know each other's names. Mine's Laura Haley. What's yours? Spencer. Spencer Hodkins. Well, Spencer Hodkins. It appears as though we have ourselves a problem. There you go, Frank, specialty of the house. Great, the rental company just got back to us. "We will look... "We will look into the matter and get back to you." There we go, problem solved. That's a little optimistic. Well, I'm an optimistic person. That's not what I mean, it's just... That's an automated response message. They probably didn't even read my email. Maybe you should have been a little more personal. Here, may I? Be my guest. Thank you. "Hi! how are you? "I'm fine. "I'm loving the house that you found for me "here in South Haven. "Now, I don't want to be a bother or anything, "but I was wondering if you could help me "with a little problem I'm having. You see, there's this man who's..." You know maybe just leave that as it is. But I thought you wanted a reply. Well, I do. But it's a psychological fact that people respond better to polite, short exchanges over the Internet, rather than long, drawn-out, and weirdly chatty emails. And you're an expert on this? I am working towards my Ph.D. in psychology right now. Really? Really. I'm a T.A. over at the university. I took this place to work on my dissertation. And... what do you do? Are you in school? No, I graduated last year. B.A. in business. And now? Now I'm here visiting my old college roommate and her husband. By yourself? Yeah, why not? I mean, you don't have a boyfriend or...? I've got Frank. Speaking of, would you mind putting him someplace so I can bring Mozart out for his dinner? Why can't you go feed Mozart somewhere else? Miss Haley... This is an awkward situation for both of us, agreed? Agreed. And the only way we're going to get through this is if we treat each other with dignity and respect. Agreed? Agreed. That includes respecting each other's pets. Agreed? Fine. Come on, Frank, let's go. Thank you. And if we don't hear back from the rental company in an hour or so, you should probably start calling the hotels around town to find room. Good idea. Wait, what? I'm sure there's someplace you and Mozart can stay for the night. Wait a minute, why am I the one that has to leave? Well... someone has to. What are you doing? You told me to put my dog away. -No, not in the... -No, Frank! Mozart? Sorry, Mozart. He's not going to hurt you. He doesn't want to hurt her, he just wants to play. Well, my cat doesn't know that. Could you please just get your dog out of my room? How is this your room? I was here first. See? My luggage. Really? well, how about my luggage? I thought that was laundry. Come on, Frank, let's go play with the squeaky squirrel. Come on, Mozart. Come on, Mozart. It's okay, kitty. Come on... Come on, Mozart. This whole house mix-up thing doesn't seem to be bothering you very much. Yeah, well, there's nothing we can do about it right now. Que sera sera. "Que sera sera..." Yeah, "whatever will be, will be." Like the song, you know... I know where it's from. You don't have to be rude. I'm sorry. It's just, well, I... I like to plan, and I was planning on having some peace and quiet to get my work done. Yeah, well, this wasn't exactly what I wanted when I rented the place either. You mean when I rented the place. Fine, you rented the place, I rented the place. So, what are we going to do about it? Maybe I can help? Hi. Who are you? I'm Ellen. Ellen Davis. I own the place. When I got the text message from the rental company, I came over as soon as I could. It's probably just a computer glitch or something. That must be it, but the problem remains, I have two tenants, and only one house. What about another rental? I can put in a request for you, but we probably won't hear anything until tomorrow. And none of the hotels in this town take pets, cats or dogs. What are we supposed to do? Right, well... I'll tell you what. I'm going to waive the first night's rental fee. No, you don't have to do that... Thank you, that's so nice of you. And I'll check back with you tomorrow, but for right now, I... I guess it's up to the both of you. So, what do you think? Can you get along for just one night? Is it safe out here? Frank is upstairs, asleep in the bedroom. It's not all his fault, you know. Nice camera. My dad had a d8100. You a photographer? Me? No. Not really. I just like to take pictures. Can I see some? No, I don't ever show anybody. It's just for me. Why not? That's for me. I ordered a pizza. Of course you did. Want some? No, thank you. I'm eating raw this month. And I don't suppose your cat wants any either? Definitely not. Mozart is on a very special diet. Frank pretty much just eats whatever falls on the floor. There you go then. What do you mean? The difference, between cats and dogs. Delicious. Delicious. Hi! Surprise! My gosh! Yeah, surprise! My gosh... I know. Wait, so there's a guy in your place? Yeah, it's just a mix-up with the rental company. It's fine. Why don't you come stay with us? That's very, very sweet, but I've already paid for the house, you know. They're not going to push me out, don't worry. Okay, just for one night, and plus, I've got Frank to protect me, right, Frank? All right, well, if you ladies will excuse me, I've got a nursery that's not going to paint itself. I thought maybe you were going to bring David. You guys make such a cute couple. Yeah, well, now he's making a cute couple with someone else. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. It's my fault, mainly. He wanted a commitment, and I just wasn't ready. I feel like I'm not ready for anything. What do you mean? I mean that I've been out of school for over a year, and I just feel like I'm lost. You know, I see you and Kenny, and you're having a baby. You're getting on with your life. And I'm still at home, working at my parents' accounting business. It's a good job. I know, it's just, it's their job, it's not mine. I'm just scared that I'm going to wake up some morning, and see my mother staring back at me in the mirror. Okay. So, what do you want to do with your life? That's just it. I have no idea. At all. So, how's the house? It's beautiful. Right on the water, and I am going to get so much work done once they're gone. When who's gone? Spencer... I thought you were alone in the house? I will be. It's just, the rental company, they messed something up, and they double-booked the place. With who? It's just this old guy. He's kinda smelly, and he's got this mutt. But they'll be gone tomorrow. Well, that's good. You really need to concentrate, Spencer. My father is counting on you, and so am I. I know, and I will. I miss you. Do you miss me? Well, it's been pretty busy around here, but, of course, I do. Goodnight, Spencer. Goodnight. I love... You. What? It wasn't exactly a lie. Besides, they'll be gone tomorrow. Nobody will ever know, and nobody will get hurt. You found your luggage. Yeah. Thank you. Goodnight. Goodnight. Good morning, Frank. Five more minutes. What is that? Morning. Yeah, it is. I like to get an early jump on the day. At 6:00 A.M.? Yeah, best time to do exercises. No noises, no distractions. I can work myself into a calm, meditative state. Frank! Just a minute! All yours. Hey, I'm making a Kale, beet, celery, vinegar, bark extract smoothie, do you want some? I'm fine, thanks. That's not very good for you, you know! Hey... Hello? Could-could you turn your music down, please? What? The... the music, could you turn it down? I'm trying to write. Well, I'm trying to get inspiration for my photographs. Could you use headphones? No, I don't like them. And I thought we were going to attempt to get along. We were, until you called me smelly and my dog a mutt. How did you...? At least we're saved. It's the rental company. I'm sure they've found something by now. Good, you won't be stuck with me anymore. And you won't be stuck with me anymore. Hello. Yes. Okay, good, very well. Thank you. Goodbye. Well? We're stuck with each other. Well, I guess the best way for us to do this is submit our respective meal plans, and then divide up the cost of the groceries. Meal plans? Yeah, you just decide what you want for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the following week, and then shop accordingly. Are you kidding? I never plan that far in advance. It's not that difficult. You just... Make a choice and stick with it. Okay, well, what if I decide on chicken wings for Thursday, and then by Wednesday, I change my mind and I want macaroni and cheese, and I'm stuck? Well, you can't just order pizza every day. I don't. Sometimes, I get Chinese, or Mexican, and Thai. You know, that's not exactly a healthy way to live. Okay, fine. I'm going to go get some groceries. Good. There we go. Graham crackers, marshmallows, and a chocolate bar. That's what you're going to eat? Are you kidding? About what? You've never had s'mores before? You take the chocolate, and you melt it with the marshmallow, and then... I know what s'mores are, thank you. I just choose not to put that much sugar and whatever other chemicals are in that into my body. Well, I do. Okay, so tell me about this paper you're writing? My thesis? I don't think you'd be very interested in that. Try me. Okay... You know much about psychology? I've got two slightly overbearing parents, does that count? I'm presenting a paper on psychobiology, specifically as it relates to human emotion. So, kind of like how the taste of pizza makes me happy? Not exactly. My theory is that any strong emotion, like love or heartbreak, is nothing more than a series of chemical reactions in the brain. You sound just like my father. He reduces everything to numbers. Well, he's not wrong. When we talk about connecting with someone, all we really mean is that their neural biochemistry in some way influences our neural biochemistry, resulting in a reaction that people call love. Have you ever been in love, Mr. Hodkins? As a matter of fact, I have a girlfriend. Her name is Susan. Well, are you in love with Susan? We're in a relationship. Well, it just sounds more like a science experiment to me. Are you sure that she's happy? It's cold out here. Do you want a blanket? Sure, thanks. S'mores? You wanna try one? I told you, I don't do sugar. I promise I won't tell anybody. All right. You know... It's actually pretty good. Didn't you ever have a campfire as a kid? I'm fairly certain it was against the law in my apartment building. Every summer, my parents and I would go camping for a week, it was the most fun that we'd have all year. Actually, it was kind of the only fun that we would have all year. It was that bad? Almost. They're both accountants, so they do everything by the book. And that's why you don't? Don't get me wrong, I love my parents. But...? But... I don't want to turn into them. Some people say that we all turn into our parents eventually. Thanks. I feel so much better now... I said "some people," some people... You know, I think it's more like being on the water. Your parents, they give you a boat. It might be a raft, it might be a yacht, but it's up to you to decide where you're going to steer it. What if we don't know where we want to go? I think, deep down, most people know where they want to go. They're just afraid to admit it. I'm sorry for that crack that I made about you and your girlfriend. It wasn't fair. I apologize. Apology accepted. The truth is, you might not be too wrong. How your parents did everything by-the-book, mine, they... They didn't even read it. I guess I was drawn to psychology as a way of finding answers to the questions I always wanted to ask them. Who knew a baby shower would take so much organizing? How am I going to fit all these people into our little house? I'm just so happy for you both. I mean, wild Rose. Who would have thought? I know, right? It had been on both of our minds for a while, and then Kenny got a new job, and we bought the place, so... the timing just made sense. This is not the Rose that I remember from college. We never used to plan anything. Yeah. I just got tired of never knowing what's next. What about our theme song? "Que sera sera"? I guess I just finally figured out what I want. I wish I could do that. I just... I don't know, I don't see myself settling down any time soon. Trust me, when you meet the right guy, it's not going to feel like you're settling down at all. It's gonna feel like you're starting the biggest adventure of your life. Balloons! I forgot the balloons! Seriously? Hi, Susan! Spencer, where were you? Just getting some fresh air. Be careful. There's a lot of pollen this time of year. Of course. Is the old man gone yet? The old man and his dog? Yeah, right. Gone. Place is empty. Just me. Well, that's good. You don't need any distractions. Absolutely. How's it going? Your paper. How's it going? Yeah, great, fine, good. It's... it's coming along. I can't wait to read it. Susan? Yeah? Are you happy? What do you mean? Are you happy, with us? With me? Don't be ridiculous, Spencer. I've got to go. I've got that fundraiser. I'll call you later? Okay. Love... You. Stop looking at me like that. There's no reason for Susan to find out, and it's not like we're doing anything wrong. Come on. Can I help you? Ellen. Laura, hello! Do you work here? More or less. I own the place. This too? And a couple of other spots in South Haven. My husband was a very smart investor. But he loved this gallery, so I keep it up as best I can. Now, I am so sorry about the rental situation. Have you decided what you're going to do? There's nothing else available in town, so we're staying put. Well, that is wonderful, and if it helps any, I'm going to return half the rental fee to both of you. Thank you. It's the least I can do. You're a photographer. No, not at all, I just take pictures. You choose your frame, you choose your lens, you're a photographer. May I? No, I don't... I don't show anyone. It's just for me. None of that, not in here. This is a sacred place. All art is safe within these walls. Okay. Thank you. A little Adams. Maybe some Imogen Cunningham. You don't, photograph people? No, I would be way too embarrassed to even try. That's too personal. Nonsense. The human face is the greatest subject of all. You have an eye. I do? My husband and I made it our mission to encourage young artists. I'm... I'm trying to carry it on, but it's not so easy these days. Hey... Maybe you'd like to help me? Excuse me? Here at the gallery. There is so much you could do. Catalog, arrange things, and in return, I would teach you everything I've learned. We could even study the great photographers together. Arbus. Cartier-Bresson. Maybe throw in a little warhol for some fun. Thank you. I just, I'm only here for two weeks. Absolutely perfect. The South Haven Art Fair is two weeks away. I have a big show that weekend, and I could use some help. Can I think about it? Of course. You have a talent, Laura. It would be a shame to see it go to waste. No! Frank! I think Frank might be getting used to her. Good. Because I've come up with a solution to our living situation. You have? Right over here. "Treaty for living under the same roof." I thought, since we had to compromise, we might as well set some ground rules. "Music shall only be played in the common areas "between the hours of 7:00 A.M. and 9:00 P.M. And at a sound level of 60 decibels or less." I measured the volume on your speakers. It was 88. "Pet access to the common areas will be on a strict rotation, "with feline activity limited to even hours and canine activity during odd hours." I thought that was perfectly reasonable, don't you? "Residents may occupy bathroom "a maximum of three times per day, "with a limit of 20 minutes per usage." One more thing. "Two towels maximum." Yeah? No? And I forgot. And to make things easier... Half for you, and half for me. So, what do you think? Time! Hi. So this guy actually made a list of rules he expects you to follow? Yeah, right down to the towels. Can't you just kick him out? No, he signed the papers. He has just as much right to be there as I do. Well, you are welcome to stay here for as long as you want. Thank you. Thank you, guys, for everything. Now, please go to sleep. I don't want you to do anything else. Please, go. Goodnight. Goodnight. Thank you. Come here, Frank. Come on. Sit, sit, sit. Yeah. This is more like it? This is more like it, Mozart? Finally, some peace and quiet. I am going to get a lot of work done. Lots of work. A lotta work. What? It wasn't my fault. It was her choice to leave. That's what she wanted. Besides, it's not a good idea to have somebody like her when you're trying to do work... Tossing her hair all the time, walking around the house, being all cute. This is better, isn't it, Frank? Just you and me. No one telling us to be quiet all the time, drinking that weird stuff that he always drinks, waking up first thing in the morning to do his sit-ups. I know. With his... Abs all... Like that. Yeah, well. Goodnight, Frank. You're no help. You have to move. No... No, no, no, okay. No, Frank, this is... No, this... Okay... Frank, I can't... I'm up, I'm up... Hey. Hi. You must be Laura, right? Cool. Well, I'm Tyler. A friend of Kenny's. I'm here for breakfast. Come on in, Tyler. Some of the most insane verticals you have ever seen. It sounds amazing. Cute, isn't he? Yeah, I guess. You guess? Come on, Laura, he's adorable. Maybe you guys should go out sometime? I'm just not really interested in dating right now. Are you really going to let that thing with David stop you from meeting the right guy? You really think that this is the right guy? I don't know, but neither will you if you don't take a chance. Whatever happened to the old Laura? "Que sera sera"? So, Kenny says you've got a crazy cat guy at your house. He's not crazy, he's just... Sensitive. He doesn't like loud music, and he doesn't let her use the shower when she wants. You gotta get rid of this guy. No, it's not that easy. He's got a contract. Maybe you need to convince him to break it? And how do you suggest I do that? Well... Figure out exactly what bothers him, and then do it, a lot. Laura... How would you like to host my baby shower? Okay... Hey, honey. Spencer, are you all right? Yeah, I just went for a run. There's a gym in that little town? No, I went for a run on the beach. Outside? Yeah, you should see this place, it's so beautiful... Spencer... It sounds to me like you're not actually getting any work done. That is not true. In fact, I'm on the verge of major breakthrough. I hope so. Don't worry, there's absolutely nothing that's going to stand between me and finishing my paper. My gosh, it's adorable! Thank you! Susan, I'm going to have to call you back. Hello? Excuse me? Hi. Excuse me. -Hello. -Rose... You didn't tell us there was going to be entertainment. Spencer, you're home early. Apparently. Sorry to interrupt, ladies. May I speak with you in the kitchen, please? Sure. Thanks. I thought you said you were going to be staying with your friends? Yeah, well, it didn't really work out, so I came back. I can see that. What's with all this? It's Rose's baby shower. Why is it happening here? Well, it was the only place that I could fit everybody. And you didn't bother telling me this because...? Well, you're so busy with your paper, I didn't want to disturb you, and I know how sensitive you are. Bye! "I just know how sensitive you are..." No, Mozart... No, no, no. No, no, no, don't... Frank! No. Mozart. Come on. Here, kitty. Frank! Come back over here! -Stop. -Mozart! Frank! Here. Kitty. Here, kitty. Come on. Come on. Not the notes! Mozart! my notes! No! Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank! Oops. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Lovely party. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Bye. Yeah. You didn't tell me he was so cute. Goodbye, Rose. Spencer, I'm so sorry. It's okay. It was just an old record anyhow. Is there anything that I can do? I think you've done enough. No, I didn't mean for this to happen. Of course you didn't. I just can't believe you'd be so disrespectful. We agreed to share this house, and now look at it. No, all we have to do is keep Frank and Mozart apart. That's not going to be a problem anymore, because I'm leaving, and I'm taking my cat with me. Here, Mozart. Here, kitty, kitty... -What? -come on. No, come on, you don't have to leave. Moz! Mozart! Come on, Mozart! Spencer, we can work this out. Why would we? You hate planning, I hate surprises. We're not a perfect match. There's nothing left in South Haven, we already tried. Where are you going to go? As far away from... This house as I can. Mozart! Furball! Come on! I think I know where she is. I don't believe it. Well, at least they're getting along. That cake really did go everywhere? Poor Mrs. Woods and the champagne. It was really quiet around here last night with you gone. You must have enjoyed that. No, actually, I didn't. I know it's wrong, and I shouldn't be feeling this way, but... I really missed you. I missed you, too. Are you really going to leave? Laura... I'll get it. What? Hi. There must be some sort of mistake, I didn't order any pizza. I did. Thanks. Keep the change. You ordered pizza? I thought you were eating raw? Well, maybe it's time I started trying to do things a little differently. You wanna share it with me? On one condition. Can we make it three towels instead of two? Okay. Three towels. Now, these are part of the series that the photographer did in one day, telling the story of a single flower from dawn until dusk. Excuse me. Laura, it's so good to see you. I hope everything's still okay at the house. It's just amazing. And Spencer? No, we're loving it, but, Ellen, I just wanted to ask you if... Yes. The offer still stands. And this is our new artist gallery. Every year, I dedicate this space to a young, emerging photographer who shows real artistic promise, and you, Laura... Are going to paint it. Man, no idea. Ice cream. Watch out for that. What? But Ansel Adams started with the feeling that he was trying to convey, and then chose his subjects, which... I'm babbling, aren't I? No, I love hearing you get so excited about something. Have you ever thought about doing it professionally? Are you kidding? My parents would kill... Sorry about that. It's not going to paint itself. It's your first portrait. It's good. It's very good. Look here, Frank. No peeking. Don't look. I'm not, I'm not... Okay, step, step... Open. What? Where did you... How did you... Do you like it? Are you kidding me? I love it. Thank you. I've got to try it out right now. Try it. I am. This is perfect. I can't believe you got me another record player. Can you hear that? You don't just hear the music. You can hear their heartbeats. Spencer, I... Yes... yes. Okay. Laura? Hello? She went to the cafe for lunch. She's been working very hard this morning, she deserved it. Well, great, thanks. I hope that everything's okay at the house? Yeah, everything is... It's great. I really am sorry about the mix-up, with the bookings. Are you kidding me? This has been one of the best things that has ever happened to me. -Hey! -Hi! I'm not bothering you, am I? No. no, no, of course not. But what's wrong? Nothing. Everything is very right. I'm done. "The Chemistry of Love" is complete. What? Spencer, that is fantastic. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you, yeah. I couldn't have gotten here without your help. You're just being nice. Well, you are going to be paying for the champagne, so... Okay, I can do that. Hey! Laura, right? Right. We're sitting at the patio, and I thought that was you. Remember me? Tyler! Friend of Kenny and Rose's. Tyler. Spencer. Nice to meet you... Hey, so did you finally get rid of that cat guy? Cat guy? Yeah, remember? You were going to do the baby shower thing. It was great seeing you, Tyler. Yeah. Maybe we can get a drink sometime? Nice to meet you, Sandy. It's not even... I promise you, Spencer, it's... Gosh. Spencer... Spencer! Spencer! Spencer, wait! The baby shower was a setup. You did it deliberately to mess with me. Why? Because... Because you wanted me out? No, I thought you hated me. Hated you? No. I don't hate you. I... I never did. I just, it was something that I told myself. Why? So I wouldn't do this. Spencer, we shouldn't... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [Needle hiss hi, Frank! I brought you a treat. Yeah? Spencer? You home? It's cold out here. You want a blanket or something? Yeah. Thanks. You make this look a lot easier than it is. I can hardly get the marshmallow to stay on the stick. Well, it comes with practice. Here. I still can't believe you never did this as a kid. I told you, my parents didn't exactly do things by the book. I guess that's why I am the way that I am. It's not so bad, the way you are. My mom and dad, they traveled a lot, for work. They were in the peace corps. I didn't get to see them that often, but they were always laughing and smiling, and having all kinds of fun. They must really enjoy their lives. They really did. When I was about 12, my mom, she got pretty sick. It all happened pretty fast, and then... She was gone. I'm sorry. It was like someone turned off a light inside of my dad and I just watched him fade away over the years, and then... Then he was gone, too. Spencer... The doctors, they said he had a weak heart, but... I just think that it was broken. Is that why you did this? "The Chemistry of Love." Yeah. I just thought if I could find some rational, biological reason behind the feelings of love, and loss, and... It might not happen again? Yeah. And then I met you, and then for the first time, I realized it's not just a series of chemical reactions. It's something so much more, and it's real. Great. Just great. I mean, there's more marshmallows... No, it's not about the marshmallows, Spencer. I don't like commitment, okay? Whenever somebody gets too serious, I take a hike. And you know why? Why? My parents. They're divorced? No, are you kidding? They've been married for 30 years. I'm sorry, I don't think I understand... No, do you realize the kind of pressure that that puts on me? Yeah, you don't want to become your parents... No... It's not that I don't want to become them, it's that I don't think that I can live up to them. I'm afraid to even try. Till you. Laura... You have a commitment, you have a girlfriend, and I won't be the person to come in between you and Susan. I won't. Goodnight. Do you want a piece of advice, Frank? Never fall in love with someone that has a girlfriend. What? Fi made a mistake. I admit it, okay? Are you just going to sit there judging me all night? What if I get you tuna? Okay, now you can judge me. Frank, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up... Spencer! You sleep in? Well, you snooze, you lose. Goodbye. Good... Goodbye. Goodbyes are hard. Goodbyes are... Goodbyes are not easy, and... I don't like saying goodbyes, but I wanted you to know that I will always remember our time here together at this... at this house? I just want you to know that you've changed my life. I want you to know that... I don't want to say goodbye. To who, Spencer? Susan? Hi! Susan! I rang, but no one answered. Who were you talking to? Nobody. Myself. I was working on my presentation. So good to see you. What are you doing here? I called you last night. Didn't you get my message? No... I'm sorry, I must have been sleeping. I... Well, that would explain why you weren't at the train station. I hadn't heard from you in two days, and I was starting to worry that something was wrong. I thought I'd... Come and see how things were going. Everything is... They're going great. I finished it. That's so amazing! Thank you. Congratulations, Spencer. That means we can spend some time together. This place is really lovely. Where are you going? I was going to go look around, is that okay? Of course. Of course, it is, yes. It's just a bit of a mess in there. I'm sure I've seen worse. Spencer, I'm, surprised you like this place. It's not really you. At all. Stay. Stay... in here and just relax. I'm going to go get Mozart. Just, she missed you, a lot. Okay. Laura! Laura! Where are you? Laura! Really? Hello, Mozart. Spencer, she's down here! It looks like your daddy has been a very bad boy. Pizza, Spencer? Really? Hello. And who are you? Laura! Laura, stay in there, don't come out. Do not come out. Spencer? There's a dog in the house. Yes, the dog. What's it doing in here? Whose is it? All yours! It's a funny story, really, it... I'm so sorry, Spencer. I tried to explain the mix-up, but... It's my fault. I should have told her from the beginning. Why didn't you? I don't know, I... I guess I just probably didn't want to admit it to myself. Anyway,... It's been a very interesting two weeks. I'll never forget... You. Come on, Frank. Say goodbye, Frank. Well, we're just going to make it. Hey, I didn't have breakfast, I'm just going to grab something real quick. Pizza? Seriously? What? I'm hungry? Come on. Come on, Frank. Let's go. So anyway, we finished the run, we got back to the chalet, when we realized that we'd left Bobby up on the hill. That guy. I tell ya... Hey, Tyler, can I ask you something? Yeah, shoot. Where do you see yourself in five years? Me? Yeah. I don't even know where I'm gonna be in five weeks. But I do know in five minutes, I'll buy you another drink. And cheers. Spencer? Spencer... They're ready for you. Where were you? Nowhere. Right here. Getting quite a crowd out there, maybe we'd better open the doors... Early. Ellen, what is this? I forgot that was in there. It's my application form and Spencer's application form, clipped together. And there are a ton of other ones, all clipped together as well, in pairs. What have you been up to? My husband and I loved that house, and after he left us, I couldn't bear to live in it alone, but I had promised him that it would always be filled with love. You do this on purpose. You double-book the house to bring people together, and that's why the questionnaires were so personal. You're match-making. It's a little bit sneaky, perhaps, but so far, it's always worked out. Until now. Spring isn't over yet, dear. Good afternoon, professors, faculty members, and distinguished guests. "The Chemistry of Love. A study in psychobiology and human emotion." By Spencer Hodkins. So glad you could make it, thank you. You see, the artist is making a statement, not only in his use of light and shadow, but also in the depth of focus that he's chosen. Well, I'd say this is quite the success, wouldn't you? Definitely. But what about the Annex? People have been asking me who it is this year. Well, I guess it's time. Would you give me a hand? Hello? Everyone, could I have your attention, please? Good afternoon, and welcome to the here at the Davis Gallery. Now, every year, I have to choose a new photographer to feature here at the gallery, someone with a fresh vision and an original eye all their own. And sometimes, it takes an out-of-towner to see our little village in a new way, and that's certainly the case this year. It gives me great pleasure to present to you the Davis Gallery emerging artist for this year, Laura Haley. Surprised? I can't believe it. Thank you. These are my photographs, in a gallery. And people really like them. Of course they do, dear. They're good. I don't know how I could ever thank you. Well, would you consider staying on with me? I could certainly use someone of your talent here. You mean, stay in South Haven? I'm thinking of starting a school of my own, just small at first, a few classes, but you never know where these things might lead. I don't know... I realize that it is quite a big commitment, but you just think it over, okay? Okay. You made it. Hi! We're so proud of you. Thank you. It's kind of overwhelming. So, what now? Now I'm going to tell my parents that I finally know what I want to do with my life, and then I'm going to tell them I love them, and then I'm going to say, "I quit." You're really going to do that? Yeah. You know, they're going to be angry, and there's probably going to be yelling, but it's what I want to do. Well, get ready. Here comes your chance. Mom! Dad! Hi! What are you guys doing here? We had a phone call from a lady who said that you were showing some of your photographs in her gallery. You didn't think we'd miss our daughter's first big show, did you? So... what do you think? It's beautiful, sweetie. Very impressed, honey. I mean, you've always had a camera in your hand, but... Who knew? Thank you, both of you. Mom, dad, I have to tell you something... Well, actually, honey, we have something to tell you first. Ed? Your mother and I, we sold the business. What? We're going to take some time off and travel, see the world for a bit. I mean, we put a little money away for you, but, I'm afraid, from now on, honey, you are on your own. What did you want to tell us? Frank! Guess what? I am a photographer. A real-life photographer. Come on, let's go for a walk and celebrate. Hello? Is somebody here? I'm renting this house! Well, there must have been some sort of mix-up. What are you doing here? I thought you had to present your paper? I did, and it did not go very well. What? What happened? They said they felt that I didn't believe what I was saying, so if I wasn't buying it, why should they? So, what are you going to do? Start over. Do you know of a place where I could stay for a while and work on it? What about Susan? Susan... Well, I tried to make s'mores for her in the apartment, and I set fire to the drapes, so... You're kidding. Actually, I am. The truth is... I'm in love with you, and there is no place else that I would rather be. Well, we're probably going to have to make up a few more rules if we're going to be under the same roof? Okay. Let's start with rule number one. Hello! Excuse me? Laura, you forgot your camera in the gallery, dear. You really need to be a little more careful. Thank you. Spencer... I wondered when you'd be back. How did you...? The light is absolutely perfect right now. Come on, outside. Let's go. This is going to be a great picture.
