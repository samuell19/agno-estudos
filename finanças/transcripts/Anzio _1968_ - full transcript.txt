I write only clean family news, Doyle, not pornography. Hey, paisan, where these creeps sending us now? Civvy or Rome? You find out, you let me know. - If you don't know, who knows? - Sixteen! Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen. Twenty! Twenty-one! Knock it off. You got it, Rich. The winner and new champion! - Richardson, the greatest! - And you're all cruds. I'll be damned. Mon cheri, you are fantastique. You have all the qualities of a Madonna, a saint... That's a lousy Charles Boyer. Why don't you stick to Bela Lugosi? It is Bela Lugosi. What does he want? Nothing, darling. He says I will destroy you, eh? He's right. Go. I will ruin you like I have ruined... hundreds of women from Salerno to Cincinnati. Go! Wait. First, let me look at your neck. Hey, Dick! Hey. I thought you were covering the Cassino front. I was. I ran out of material. They all died on me. Peace! Peace. The Black Devils. I gotta get the first crack at Rabinoff. Peace. Peace. Crap on that. Get the mothers! Let's get the hell out of here. Listen, I heard about that Rapido River thing. That must've been a real slaughter, huh? Yeah, that's what it was, Abe, a real slaughter. Two thousand cowboys from Texas... spinning around in rubber boats... and the Germans sitting on the other side... zeroed in on them with machine guns. Very poor general management. Basta. Basta. Hey, Ennis. Ennis, you son of a bitch. I remember you from Sicily. The first day, remember? I was up a tree. I think this guy used a pipe on me. Hey, I got something for you. Here, sarge. "Admit one" where? Paradise. All high-class women there. Use it fast, Ranger, before your number's up. Do I know him? Corporal Rabinoff. Sure you do. He keeps it up, he's gonna be... the most famous corporal since Hitler. I'd venture to say he's got about a footlocker... full of medals just for the number of guys he's bumped off. When's this show gonna hit the road? I'll never understand you. I just don't get you at all. Seven years... from China to Italy, you haven't got enough of this crap? What are you bucking for, a little white cross? What are you talking about, Abe? Well, you don't have to be here. I'd like to be in your shoes for about five minutes... just five minutes. You've got a one-way ticket out of this crap... anytime you wanna use it. Why don't you? Where would I go? Go? Home! Back to the U.S., man. That's where they're making the real sacrifices. You said it. Well, I'll take that under advisement. Listen to me, huh? From a friend... I think you're starting to talk a little funny. Now, if you were one of my guys... I'd think about putting you in for a Section Eight. You're kidding. No, I'm not kidding. I think you're beginning to like it. No, I'm not beginning to like it... but I must admit it does get easier. Take it easy, sergeant. You're liable to give them hangovers. Attention! All right, Rangers, it's time to dry out. Prepare to embark in six hours. Your briefing will be aboard ship. All right. Dismissed. See you at halftime, Dick. They're all troublemakers. Later. Oh, Mr. Ennis. I saw your column on the Rapido mess today... at headquarters... In the wastebasket. If it's of any interest to you... a one-star general was rotated home today. That's not why I wrote it, colonel, you know that. Not just to knock somebody down. It seems like a pretty emotional piece of writing. Well, those Texas boys didn't have to die. They knew that. But they were dead before they could say it. I could say it, and I did. You're a fierce friend to have, Mr. Ennis. What time's the landing gonna be, colonel? Now, you know better than to ask a question like that. You'll be told when you get aboard. Anzio! Many pretty girl at Anzio. American PX, first-class. Nylon stockings, Joe! Nylon stockings, first-class. Nylon stockings for Anzio. Anzio! The Germans will hear him to Berlin. Buy! I make special price for Anzio. Cigarettes. Sigarette. Cigarettes. Candy, si. Sigarette, no, huh? Here. Shut up. Not now, baby, I'm trying to drive this wagon. All right, all right, all right. Here. Here, eat this and be quiet. Hey, basta, basta! Hot stuff here. Come on, I got some hot stuff here. Move it back. Hey, police! Pack these guys up, they're all diseased. Easy, there, easy. What's the trouble? I'm telling you, the whole outfit is infected. I wouldn't lie to you. Cut out the din. What's your unit? First Special Service Force. Canadian-American. Ah, Black Devils. Weren't you the men in Sicily who...? Right, right. We're the guys. Look, sarge, I got a man in the back who's in bad pain. I gotta get going. Oh, all right. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Move it back there. Let's go, let's go. Move it. All right, move it out. That's right, come on. Outstanding. Outstanding work. Outstanding work. God save the King. Right, here we go.

The area's secure, sir. Very good. General, just one more shot. This way, sir. General, this way. May we have a statement, sir? Well, gentlemen, at last. Sorry to keep such a tight lid on this, but it's big. At 0200 tonight... General Jack Lesley will bypass the Cassino line... which is stalemated... and put an army corps on the beach at... - Anzio! - Goddamn it! Who said that? Ennis, sir. Dick Ennis, International Press. Well, Mr. Ennis, where do you find your information? In the streets of Napoli, general. Looks like a real turkey shoot, Jack. How does that affect your plans, General Carson? In no way. When 70,000 men come ashore... they're bound to make a splash... and the enemy is bound to hear it. Dwyer, Chicago Post. This to General Lesley. What opposition are you expecting, general? There are two German divisions in that area. If I were Kesselring... I'd have them on the beaches in two hours. Donovan, Reuter. Do you plan to make a run for Rome, sir? No. No, I intend to drive into Rome very slowly. We will be the first conquering army... to enter Rome from the south in 1500 years. Hold it, general. Could we have General Lesley too, please? Thank you, sir. Jackson, London Post. The hills behind Anzio, if I remember my Horace... pose a dangerous obstacle, general. Do you propose to go for those hills first? It's your answer, Jack. The first duty of a general is to secure his position. I will therefore strengthen the beachhead... against Kesselring's counterattack. General Lesley... they used to say the first duty of a general is to succeed. How about that? In my book, being safe and being successful... are not contradictory. That's right, Jack. Don't stick your neck out like I did at Salerno. First secure the beachhead, then you can be a wildcat. That's all, gentlemen. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you. How do you spell this name? A-N-Z-O, right? No, that's not it. That's "Anzo." It's "Anzio" we're going to. What are you worried about? They'll spell it right... on that cute little white cross of yours. A-N-Z-I-O. That's "Anzio," right? Hey, Cellini, tell him how the ginzoes pronounce it. Bafangoo. Sorehead. Where do you write when the battle starts? Right up there on the line with you guys. You, uh, get enough protection from that thing? No, not much. Stimmler, how soon before we hit shore? About four hours. I'd better check my equipment. Ten-hut! At ease. At ease. You fellas get enough to eat tonight? Yes, sir. Good, good. See you on the beaches. You get enough to eat tonight? Yes, sir. Let's hope the Krauts come down... with a good case of indigestion. And if not, sir, we'll give them a real case of the GIs. Oh, Mr. Ennis. I don't ordinarily court newspapermen, Mr. Ennis... like some generals I know. However, I would like to set the record straight... on a few points. Do you know what success in battle... really means, Mr. Ennis? It's never simply territorial gains. Many battles have been lost... after the objectives have been won. I believe that every foot of ground gained... must be balanced by the cost. Cost per foot in terms of human lives. Now, the invasion tonight will be successful. Most large-scale landings are. But the difference between a real success and failure... will be spelled out after we hit the beaches. I have two responsibilities tonight, Mr. Ennis: one to my mission... and the other to my men. Human lives are important to me. You can print that. Wasn't it Napoleon who said: "A general who worries too much about his men... is doomed to failure"? I may be a cautious man, Mr. Ennis, but I am certainly not a pacifist. Tell me... You know, I've followed your work now for many years. Why do you make a trip like this? Well, obviously, I make trips like this... because it's what I'm paid to do. It's my job. I know, I know, but... Also, of course, I have to. I have to answer a question that's been asked of me... ever since I saw my first dead face: Why do we do it? Why do people kill each other? How can a perfectly ordinary, good-natured guy... who wouldn't slap down a mosquito... sit up in an airplane... and bomb 1000 sleeping strangers down beneath him? We do it to survive, Mr. Ennis. In war, it's kill or be killed. Oh, come on, general, you don't buy that. If I didn't, I wouldn't be here. What's your answer? I haven't found an answer. But when I do, I promise you'll be among the first to know, General Lesley. Your coat, sir. We're changing course for Anzio. It's cold. Yeah, landings are always cold. Excuse me, Mr. Ennis. Can't they shut up a little? At ease. What time? Now? Fourteen seconds. Well, Abe, a few minutes more... and you can pin another battle star to your tunic. Screw it. Right now, I'd trade it for a stateside ration card. Now it's Rome's turn. What do you mean? It was here at Anzio that Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Now it's Rome's turn to watch the glow in the sky. All right, Rangers, let's go. Pull it up. All right, move it out. Let's go, boys. There you are. Quiet night. Yeah. Just like it was at Salerno. They let us get in, in, in... Knock it off. That's the way it was at Salerno. I said, knock it off. I can feel it coming. Any second now. Hold it. All right, let's go. Let's go! Three o'clock! Well, at least nobody can say... that the landing at Anzio was unopposed. Let's move in, sergeant. How are things up here, Pete? It sure isn't Salerno, colonel. Damn funniest thing I ever saw. My orders are to move up three miles and dig in. And if we don't meet them, sir? Move up, dig in, and we'll wait for them. All right, let's go. Uh, colonel, a favor? Give. I'd like a jeep. I'd like to, uh, snoop around a little. Whose neck are you after now, Ennis? All right. Captain, get him a jeep and a driver. Okay. Sergeant, a jeep and a driver. What'd you say? A jeep and a driver. I got a jeep, I'm not sure about a driver. You have a driver, sir. Excellent driver. All right, so him we can spare. Watch out for him, Dick, he's a virgin. Let's go. Wait a minute, stop the jeep. What is it? Hold it. Something back there alongside the road. Let's see what it is. It's one of theirs. I wonder what got to him? I bet he goes back to using safety razors. Small world. What are you doing? Just fooling around. That could be dangerous. You seen any Germans? No. You? A couple of strays. They all look like that one? Well, this was a crucial defense position. The man had to go. You want a ride? Why not. Where are all the Germans? I don't know, but if this keeps up... we're gonna hit Rome. Hey, look at that! You know, I'm beginning to think... they actually didn't know... and that we've surprised the bejesus out of them. We have nothing. They can go where they like! Nothing! Not as much as a minefield to stop their walk. Had they landed two days ago... when the Goering division was here... I would've burned the sea under them. General field marshal, Monte Cassino... General von Vietinghoff. Kesselring. Yes. Yes, you heard right. They are pouring in... and we have no one to put against them. They can scoop up Rome. Of course it's the hills. The hills are why they are here. Highway 6 and 7 and the railway. Our arteries. No, you may not. Listen to me, von Vietinghoff... No, I will not shorten the Cassino line. I'm sometimes surprised, but I'm never panicked. You're very complimentary. Now, who can you give me? The 3rd Panzer Grenadiers? They must be up by tomorrow night. Tanks, flamethrowers. I know they must move by day. I know they will be bombed. I know they must suffer casualties. And I want the Hermann Goering division back. I'm going to take the 19th out of the line of hill 165. I've taken them. If you are afraid of gaps... put the cooks and the generals into the line. General field marshal, Air Reconnaissance. Of course I was joking. Hold, please. Man can't even take a bad joke. Kesselring. Yes. What? Five kilometers? You're sure? You said five kilo...? You are sure? Five kilo... Thank you. As a soldier, I'm ashamed of them. They're digging in. They are going headfirst into the ground. Now be fast. The 71st Infantry, get them moving in an hour. No, no, cancel. In half an hour. Von Vietinghoff, I have nothing at Anzio! For the next few hours... I must do what I can with my own hands! Heil Hitler! I'll wake him at 6. They could sleep in the hotels of Rome tonight. My only defense is they don't know it. Rome must be pretty close. This looks a little like Westchester County. Sure as hell ain't Philadelphia. Boy, the Krauts really hit this place. Movie, that's the way it is. That's Rome. Rome? I'll be a son of a bitch. I'm getting out of here, Ennis. Come on, Movie, let's go on in. No, no, Ennis. This is crazy... Come on, you'll be the first conqueror... to enter Rome from the south for 1500 years. Me? You're the man with the sword. Yeah, that's right. You're the man. Feel like another Julius Caesar? Better than Julius Caesar. He didn't have to risk his life in a jeep. Germans. Pull in that alley, quick. Hey! Quiet. Shh. No, no, no, grazie. Dopo. Shh. Quiet! Keep it to yourself. Look, the Germans? What is that? I think he said that the troops left a few weeks ago. There's nobody left there... but the SS and the military police. Christ, this is an open city. Well, what are we gonna do about it? We're gonna jump right in that jeep... and run back to the beachhead and tell Mama. Movie, come on. Come on, get in. I'm in love. Come on! Let's go! I shall return! I've a damn good mind to take a chance and go. You weren't at the clobbering at Salerno. We're a new kind of animal now. We're like tortoises, we keep our necks in. Where are their tanks, their lorries even? It's only three hours to Rome. Doesn't he see the possibility? Why don't you ask him? By God, I will, sir. Your boys are doing a fine job, general. This will give Kesselring a hell of a surprise. General Lesley? Yes, General Starkey? I request permission to put out an armed patrol towards Rome. I can't afford to provoke an attack yet. But, sir... Denied! Luke. What do you think? Our luck's been running so good, Jack. We might try a small gamble. Couple of hundred men, huh? Mm. Something like that. Just an idea. It might give the German a taste of our blood... and bring him down on us before we're set. You know, I still have that beachhead to build. If I don't have that, I have nothing. This silence is a damn clever way... of dealing with us, gentlemen. We've planned for everything but this. But it's just a sight too clever. It's given us what we need... time to get ashore and flourish. And General Starkey... there's no doubt in my mind... that Kesselring's strategy is to draw us forward. I'm sure he's prepared quite a welcoming committee for us. Well, Marshal Kesselring will just have to sit and wait. All our moves will be made down here on the beaches. But sir, what if he isn't yet in strength? What if he can't attack? Then, general, in five or six days... after careful plans have been made... based on sound intelligence, we'll go out and look for him. Here it is, just as I thought. Herr Kesselring is getting worried. And I can't say that I'm sorry. Smack into the port. Heavier than anything we've got, Jack. American jeep coming in, sir. What? Where? From our front lines. You said Rome, Mr. Ennis? That's right, general. We went in at 40 miles an hour and came back out at 50. I can't believe it. Roads weren't jammed with Kesselring's troops? No, sir. If it hadn't been for the SS... and a few military police... the city seems wide open. Would you like me to have a look, sir? Kesselring wouldn't spring a trap for one jeep. No, general, we stay put. And don't worry, we'll catch our fox... but in our time, not his. Thank you, Mr. Ennis. The 64th Infantry are coming through, sir. Good, we have caged them in. I'll never understand these last seven days. They came roaring ashore... only to fall direct on the beach. Anzio is the cheapest POW camp in Europe. 50,000 men who feed themselves. I feel I am present at a farce in a theater. Up here, we sit comfortably in the dark. They are on a lighted stage. We can see every gesture of the actor. If he lights a cigarette, we can puff out the match. They are so young. Some of them are what, 15? Yes, but with spirit, pride. If pride and love of Germany alone could win battles... we could take the world. But wars are won by machines and gasoline and oil. You and I must beg, must plead, for our supplies. But there, a sergeant's call is enough. Nevertheless, I say we have reason to hope for the best. Then let us prepare for the worst. I want a new line, stronger... and more impenetrable than Cassino. Minefields as thick as wheat fields. Every house a fortress. Every hedge a tank trap. I want bunkers, pillboxes... a wall of steel and concrete clear across Italy. Draft every Italian you can get your hands on, but be careful. Work only at night. Camouflage everything... so that nothing can be seen from the air. The enemy must not know... it is there until they fall in front of it. Yes, sir. And what code name, sir? It defends Rome... The "Caesar Line." Sir, there is a movement of trucks on the enemy right. Yeah, I can see them opposite Cisterna. They've good intelligence. It's our weakest point. Then make it our strongest. Hey, Rich, here's one I've been working on. Who's this? "Oh, Mammy!" Shirley Temple calling her mother. Funny. - Hey, Mr. Ennis? - Yeah. Please, before you forget... would you write down that address for me? What address? In Rome. Rome, the girl... The girl with... Just give me the name of the street. I was looking the same place you were looking. I knew it. Handle it well, Ranger... I'll be waiting for some good news. - Yes, sir. - General Lesley... this is an unexpected pleasure. Just dropped by to wish your men good luck. This infiltration is a bold venture, colonel... but we know there's a gap there right up to Cisterna. I see your Rangers travel light. - Yes, sir. - Except for me, sir. I want you to play merry hell when you get out of that ditch. You'll be on your own for a couple of hours... but when the tanks come up to you... this whole front will crumble fast. Well, we'll do our best, general. That's the ticket. See you all in the morning. Yes, sir. You know that you don't have to go along, Ennis. Yeah, I know that, colonel. You want a weapon? No, thank you. Things could get a little rough out there. I've been where it's rough before. Besides, if I do get it... I won't be around to write about you. Well, that's one consolation. The 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions are ready, sir. Very good, Pete. Move your men out to the kickoff point. A Black Devil guide will be there to lead you to the ditch. Be careful not to lose him in the dark. If he's such a hotshot guide... I'm sure he'd find us. Sergeant? Nothing, sir, it's just that... Well, we did manage to make it this far out of Africa... without any special help. I know how you feel, sergeant... but remember, those are good men. They spend half their time behind enemy lines. Yes, sir. All right, Pete, move them out. Very well, sir. Fall in! - Fall in! - Fall in! Down! Anybody faint? Hey, Ennis! Small world. I take it you're our guide, soldier. Uh, that's right, captain. Just keep your mouth shut and follow my ass. Corporal. Consider yourself busted. Whatever you want, captain... but look, I didn't mean no harm by that, and... I'm gonna take care of everybody. That's my job. I don't care how rough it gets. I'm gonna take care of everybody. So just trust me. I'd trust him, captain. All right, this is it. From this point on, we're behind the lines. Pass the word back: no talking, no whispering, no nothing... just walk quiet. Mm. All right. From this point on, we're behind enemy lines... Sure you don't want to go back? Made it this far, Dad. All right. Suit yourself. You like doing this? I don't mind, really. Let me tell you, it's a hell of a thing you're doing. I just can't resist a good story. Oh, you do it for the story? No kidding. Well, that's a hell of a thing... I don't know why I do it. Well, I know why I do it. And someday I'll tell you. And it's got nothing to do with democracy. Hold it. Wine, fresh fish and women, four miles up. Pass it on. That's Cisterna. Open country. Deploy your men, sergeant. Mr. Ennis? Yeah. I was thinking, as soon as this is over and we take Rome... I take out an ad in the paper. What did you say? An ad, an ad. I'll take out an ad that describes her, really describes her. It'll never work, Movie. Why? There must be a thousand girls in Rome with... hands like that. Haystack! Down! It's bad. Bad. It's a setup. Christ, we've been had. Get through to command, quick! Tell them we're trapped. Tell them "tanks." I've got nothing to fight tanks. Put down your weapons and stand up. Put down your weapons and stand up. You will be well-treated. We give you the protection of the Geneva Convention. We will wait 20 seconds for your answer. Beachhead, this is Rangers one-niner, over. Fifteen. Ten. Five. Negative! He's had it. Beachhead, this is Rangers nine. One-niner. Captain... Get up, damn it! He's had it. Keep trying, Andy. Keep trying! We got tanks on every side. I repeat, tanks. Medic! Medic! - They got Ennis! - We're pinned down. Everybody dying. Do you read me? Over. You're okay. They don't shoot dead people, Rich. I found that out. You goddamn son of a bitch. Look, we can't play dead, Ennis. We got guns. Every man's got his own way of trying to stay alive. Yeah? Well, you just tell that to the guy who gets killed... sticking his neck out for you. Those bushes at four o'clock. Let's try for them. Hey, Rabinoff! Shut up. We're gonna try for the bushes at four o'clock. Yeah? Who's we? Me. Okay. Good luck. Let's go. You want this? No. Flamethrower! It's gonna get hot. Won't take them long to get around to us. Let's see what's out back. If we can make it over to that thicket... Yeah, let's go. we might make it. Yeah. Hold it! Minefield. All right, fellas, now gently, just turn around... and try to find your way in your own footsteps. We gotta take this bastard on. Maybe we'll get lucky and blow a track. Save the grenades. Just gather up a gang of rocks. What's with rocks, Ennis? We haven't got a prayer against that thing. We got better odds in the minefield. What the hell are you doing? Everybody fall down! Again! Hit it! Where'd you learn this? Learned it from an old Chinese. - Did he make it? - No. But he might have. All right, let's give him a hand! Anybody watching that tank? Yeah! Down we go! Hit it! I recommend surrender. Pass it on. Everybody down! Hey, he heard that one! All right, come on, let's go. God is love, God is love. Hey, you crazy mother...! It's easy. The fool made it! Let's go! That's where we were. Seven hundred and seventy-six of us. For nothing. Get that thing working. It's been beat to hell this morning. Fix it. Where are we now? Are there any dispatches? Nothing. We are running into heavy opposition everywhere. This is Rangers one-niner. - Sir! - Jack! Rangers one-niner. Over. Come in, Rangers one-niner. Corp commander speaking. Where are you? I got somebody. I don't know how long. You better hurry up. Hello. Hello, Beachhead, this is Dick Ennis. I'm somewhere up here on the Alban Hills with the survivors. Sorry to take you away from the gaming table, general... but I thought you'd like to know... you lost a couple of pins off your chart today. The first and second Ranger battalions have been wiped out. Do you read that? Of 767 men, there are seven survivors... left to see the result of one more royal foul-up. But this one's unique. This didn't happen because a general was too reckless. This happened because a general was too cautious... how about that? An entire outfit wiped out because the general was timid. I know it scarcely ever happens that way, general... but it sure as hell happened here. A timid general. He walked them into a park... and he left them in a graveyard. Sir... Rangers one-niner, we are losing your signal. Graveyard. That won't quite get it, will it? That's it, Ennis. We lost them. That doesn't begin to put across... what's going on here. They can't hear you. Yeah, I know. They never did. Ain't that a bitch? A dumb, dirty, stupid, useless bitch. What are you doing, sarge? But the guys are dead. They're dead, right? I mean, that's part of the job. Why take it out on the radio? I just hope we don't have to make a call. Well, they're dead, right? What are you gonna do? Here it comes. Hold your breath, boys. Is that ours? That's ours. That's ours! That's ours! That's one of ours! That's ours! Woo-hoo! Drop bombs, baby! Drop bombs! Get down! Get down! Down! Come on, baby! That's my baby! Keep your head down. The woods are full of Krauts. I don't see anything. They're there. Believe me, they're there. It looks like trucks. That could be a supply depot. We're 30 miles from nowhere. What are they supplying? Looks more like a prison camp. Look, you see that break in the trees? Yeah. Yeah, it's a wire stockade. Jesus, those woods are walking. It's a construction job. But what are they laboring at? Who the hell knows. Roads, bridges, maybe even a railway. I don't know, sergeant... with all those men and those equipment... it looks big to me. I think we ought to take a look. Is that what you think, corporal? I'll tell you what I think. My job is to get us safe out of this mess. Those trucks could be going anywhere. They could be going to Rome, north, maybe even Yugoslavia. Well, it's 6:00 at night, sergeant. Why are they bringing concrete mixers? Because the Germans have got no air cover. They gotta work at night. They can't use the day. Boy, these patrol specialists gripe my ass. You're fighting instinct, Abe. No, Ennis, I get tired of... Yeah, maybe I am. Hey, Rabinoff, come here, will you? Okay. Okay, but we do it my way. We all go look in groups. Cellini, you and Andy. Doyle, Movie, come with me. And Richardson, you go with Rabinoff. Dick? Why not? I might be able to get 800 words out of it. Stick with these guys. Okay. Hey, Ennis. Might find this will come in handy. I doubt it. What the hell is it? It's a great big trap. Look at that, that's better than the Cassino line. By the time the man gets those fellas off the beach... it'll be just waiting for them. How about that? Now you see it, now you don't. No sirens, no whistles, no nothing. It's too secret for sirens. All right, now we've seen it. What do we do about it? Well, we take a closer look, memorize everything we can. You go on down that end... and I'll cover it from over here. It'd be nice to have somebody look in the middle, but, uh... You go right ahead on. I'll meet you back here. Hey. Come on, you got in here. Come on, get me out. I surrender! Surrender! Another five minutes and we'd have given you up. Where is Richardson? Don't wait up for him. Why? What happened to Rich? He got shot. How? What the hell's the difference? He's dead. Simple, huh, sarge? Just like that, eh? Look, Doyle, when you're dead, you're dead. That's all there is to it. You keep that in your head. It might help keep you careful. Just be glad this one wasn't you. You okay to move, Ennis? Yeah, why not? Rabinoff and the Ginzo are scouting... the bombed house down the road. If it's safe, we'll put up there for the night. Hey, Movie, Cellini, take a look in that cellar. Doyle, check it out upstairs. Hey, Rabinoff, come here, will you? Dick? Yeah. Let's take a look at this thing. This is the coastline. Here's Anzio, here's Rome, here's Cisterna. This must be the line of defense. Where'd you say we were, Rabinoff? Here? Right about there. Okay. Our main objective is to get back to Anzio... as quick as possible, preferably in one piece. I think we ought to go south... try to break through around Cassino someplace. That's gonna take a month. In a month, that line's gonna be real hard. If you gotta get back there's only one way. Direct to Anzio. Jesus, Dick, we'll be crawling over the dead. It's the live ones I worry about... because they get the wrong ideas. This war's starting to shape up after all. I gotta show you something lovely. Take a look what your old dad found. Come on, don't be afraid. Let's go. Come on, nobody's gonna hurt you. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. Come on, let's go. Come on. Don't be afraid. Let's go. Should see the setup in here. Very cozy. Well, who are they, and what are they doing here? Emilia Sibilio. Diana e Anna. They live here. It's their house. Have they seen any Germans today? No. Ask her if she knows anything... about what's happening back in Anzio. The Germans are attacking. They're driving. They're driving us back to the sea. Anna. Excuse. I speak a little English. Not too good. My mother say you welcome to stay. We are alone, three women. The food is poor, but... lo divideremo with you. Well, that's about the best offer I've had this war. Thank you very much, Diana. Wait, you're Anna. Anna. Come on downstairs, Anna. Bring your family. Questo buono. Uh... C-Ration-o. Mucho good-o. Where'd you get that? I found it. Made in Germany.

The sooner you tell your mother, the better. Not possible to leave. My family always live here. Always the same house. Four generazioni. So cannot leave. Also, we must to wait for my father to come. Where is your father? Tedeschi take him for to... how you say...? Yeah, you mean the Germans drafted him... to work on that new line. Yes. Five day past. One day he with us, one day he not.

Look, fellows, I, uh... I think he can use the air more now than the company. Okay? Is there anything anybody can do? No, no, unless you have a Band-Aid. Very funny. Oh. That's murder. No, it's the stomach, you see. A Japanese grenade. Ripped all my insides out. Got all metal in there. Under tension, it contracts... and all hell breaks lose. I must have been tense, huh? Good thinking. You belong in a hospital, not in a war. Yeah, that's what they told me in Lindermann... when they sent me home. You mean to tell me you got out... then you went to Canada and joined this outfit? That's right. How'd you get past the doctors? Lied about my age. You've gotta be crazy. Half of your guts blown out... and you're back in here? What for? This is a hell of a time for an interview. You got something better to do? Why did you re-enlist? Why? Because I like it. You know, I missed it, Ennis. I want this. You know, with all the mud and the pain... and the dirt and the dying and those clowns giving orders... for me, there's nothing like it. Look, a guy sells shoes for 40 years... I live more in one day. I see more, and I feel more... I taste more, I think more. I'm more. Understand? I'm more. You know, there's more to living than just breathing. - Capisce? - Capisce. You're the same way. That's right. War is part of you. You belong to it, and when this one's over... you're gonna find another, and I hope I'm with you. Yes, sir, man, that was a rough one. What the hell is this, a wake? Come on, Sam, where are you? Come on, baby, we've got work to do. Come over here. From the top, one time. Lovely skin, eh? Quiet! Kill those lights! Put out that fire! You got an attic in this place? - No capisco. - Attic! Attic! - Attic! - Si, capisco. Come! Come on, open up, signora. All right, get. Come on, you can't stay here. For God's sake, Ennis, come on! Come on. I cannot go with you. Do you know what those people will do to you... if they find you alive in this? - No, I cannot go. I cannot go! - Ennis, let's move! - Will you come on? - You go. - Your men are waiting. - Grazie. What's the matter with you? What about them? They're not our problem. Anzio's this way, remember? Come on, let's go. Boy, this guy is good. Get a move over. Leave him alone, Movie. He's hit. He's dead. Come on, we can use him for cover. Sure he's dead? He is now. He's good, all right. You better believe it. Where the hell is he? He's about 50 yards. He's over there. How many of them are there? I'm not sure. I think four. Where did that come from? Over there, about eleven o'clock. They're all around us. Abe! - Yeah, Dick? - How are you? No score. I see a little dust on your right. Watch him. Check! Let's take out the guy at eleven o'clock. That's your grenade. The same time, let's make our move. We gotta get around them. All right. Now? - Now. - Now. Movie. Movie! Yeah, I'm okay. Okay. All right, stay put. You can cover Stimmler from there. Hell, this is no good. Unless we get back to the ditch. - Hey, Andy? - Yeah? Cover us. We're gonna make it back to the ditch. Okay, get moving. Let's go. Okay, Andy! - Andy! - Wait... - Cellini. - Yeah. See if you can make your way down this ditch about 20 yards. When you think you're behind him, give me a signal. When I yell "now," I'll cut out in front... and you get him from behind. Okay. Now! Hey, Abe! Hey, Abe! Yeah, Dick? You all right? I'm hit. Dick? Andy and Cellini are both dead. They're taking us out one by one. I'm going out after him. - Movie! - Yeah. There's one out there at four o'clock. It's the first hole this side of the ridge. I'm going out after him. Give me all the cover you can. You got it. Going out! Go! Just in case, I hope it's a good story. Keep your head down. Hey, Rabinoff. Okay, Rabinoff. Make your move! I see him. All right, Movie. Keep him in your sights. You got it. I got him. I got him! There's another one, Movie. Keep your eye on him and cover me. Right here, German. Welcome to the club, Mr. Ennis. This all of us? Come on, we still got a half a mile to go. They have artillery emplacements here... machine gun posts all through here... tank traps here and up through here. These are minefields here, here, here. As a matter of fact, the whole area is mined. Bunker, bunker, bunker, bunker: all bunkers through here. I'll be damned. All right, Paul, you got the picture. I want that line hit high and low... around the clock. There mustn't be another shovelful of earth turned. That line mustn't get solid. Put everything you've got over it. Mr. Ennis, thank you. Oh, Jack, we're going up to the line. Want to come along? I'll finish here first, Luke, thank you. Very well. You did a great job, Mr. Ennis. Thank you. I suppose you'll be taking a good, long rest in Naples? No, as a matter of fact, general, I think I'll stick around your show little while longer. It's no longer my show, Mr. Ennis. I'm going home. I was relieved. I was replaced the day before yesterday by General Howard. It would seem as if you and Napoleon had a point. My epitaph... written by no less a person than Winston Churchill: "I had hoped we were hurling a wildcat onto the shore... but all we've got is a stranded whale." He knows how to use words. Yeah. Had I been given a few more days... I might've gotten out of Anzio with a little honor. Well, at least you are getting out... with your life, general. I guess that is something. Well, what happens next? Next? How does it work out on the table? Oh, we'll win. It'll take considerably more time now... more lives... but we'll drive Kesselring back. General Carson will have his day in Rome. And then? Then? Why, we defeat the enemy. We win the war. What happens then? You mean we just choose up sides... and start all over again? You think of this as a game? Well, after all, general, is it not the ultimate game? And not for survival? Not for survival... nor to secure shelter nor to appease hunger. Oh, you've found your answer then. I believe I have, general. Men kill each other because they like to. Because they like to? And that's it? That's it. Plain and simple. They love to. War has never solved anything, history teaches us that. But you face a man with a gun in your hands... you live more intensely at that moment... than in any other moment in your life. Because you're scared to death, and you've got to kill him. We kill each other because we like to. That's a hell of a condemnation of mankind, Mr. Ennis. Yes, I'm afraid it is, general... but maybe if we recognize it and admit it to ourselves... we might learn to live with each other. We hope. Hey, Mr. Ennis! She's mine! Hey, Movie! Hey, Movie! Hey, Mr. Ennis, look! On the arch! Two thousand years later. Nothing changes... except the uniforms and the transportation. Well, we've seen the conquering hero. Let's go.
