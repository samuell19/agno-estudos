My mother is a great mathematician. You are great in apple polishing. So, mother! You are now going to give me Rs.4000. When did I say that? You had only said if you take 4000 from 73,000, it will be 69,000. Why do you want Rs.4000? I thought of giving you Rs.500 from it. You said it just now, mother. Mother...

Boy, this is Kurnool. Be careful. - Let us go boys. - It is mine. Huh? Hey! Bulli! He is here. Yuck! Gosh... Didn't I tell you, this is Kurnool. This is very common here. Let is go... "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Oh my heart, tell me the truth." "My Pallu simply doesn't stay in place." "Naughty is this way of my age." "Hooray! This dancing monkey business." "Yippee! Where would it lead now?" "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Oh my heart, tell me the truth." "My Pallu simply doesn't stay in place." "Naughty is this way of my age." "Oh my! Riding on a fine horse..." "they say prince charming would arrive, is it?" "Did you check him out oh Mynah?" "Is he bringing a pearl palenquin?" "Hooray! Who is that interesting husband?" "Yippee!

Twist... twist. Good. Feeling shy? The exams are nearing. - I do not know how am I going to prepare? - Yes. Swapna... - Swapna, let us go home. - What happened? Quick. Let is go. Has something happened to my father? Obul Reddy has killed your brother. Do not cry. Have some water. - Dear, have you informed Suresh? - I did. He respects him very much. They studied together till 10th std. Everything must be performed as per our customs. - Has the washer man come? - Yes, he has. Make it fast. Hey, your brother has come. Get up... get up. You wanted your brother and sister to study well. There he is. Look at him. Your engineer brother has come. Get up. Get up. Look at your brother... He should have lit my pyre. But the fate has made me to lit his pyre. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me, I say. It's just an art of combat. You should shout so loud that Nizam should hear when I stab you on your nerves. Idiot! Hi! Nephew. Remove it. Why are your eyes so red like chilly? Did you cry on your brothers death? Or are you angry with me? I can understand your sorrows. Get buttermilk for my nephew. Add a hint of lime. It will cool his body. What did I do? I did not ask for palaces. I invited him. He spat on my face in public. Am I a piglet? I am son of Rayalaseema pride. I chased him & killed him. Come and have butter milk. Hey! Good. Come... Very good. Mom, come this way. What is this guys? It's in the size of an onion. It should be in a size that could blast the entire Allagadda. Should my mom tell you everything? Make them bold. Mom, you come with me. Greetings, madam. Greetings, madam. Bulli, come on... move. Hey, make it fast. You come. All of you get in. Greetings. Greetings... Please sit down. Hey, come here. This is for your, elder brother-in-law. This is for your, younger brother-in-law. Forgive me. Uncle, where is Swapna? Sit down... sit down. I killed 20 people by planting a bomb in a car. When I knew that our enemies were travelling by bus. I burnt the bus. Land deal problems, property problems. Problems at the time of elections, there are about 30-40 cases filed on me. But, no witnesses for any crime. Who can dare to testify against me? You should have heard about my manliness. If I wish, I had neither left a widow nor a new born baby is mother. I have touched almost all women, whom I like in this area. But, had I ever touched you? I did not. Do you know, why? I love you. I was waiting for you to mature. You come into my dreams. You make me cry & laugh. You are my queen. You are the queen of my house & fort. If anyone tries to stop our marriage. He will die. Hey kid, she is a little girl. She is feeling shy. I am an elderly person, I am here. I will talk to them. Look, Dasaratharama Reddy. We must come out from our sorrows. Can you get back your sons by crying? My son says he loves your daughter. He wants to marry her. Since we belong to the same caste, I agreed. Your son told my son is 15 years older and marriage cannot be performed. Can he put such a question to my son? Is not there 15 years age difference between me & my husband? Did not we have children or did not I give birth to them? Look, it is said that, in the house where a death has occurred, An auspicious function should be performed. If marriage is conducted, my son will be both son & son-in-law to this house. We will fix the alliance. If you have any relatives, invite them. Come on, my son. Bye. I love you. I will marry Obul Reddy, father. - Swapna. - Do not stop me. Let me do this at least now. If I had done this earlier, my brothers would have been alive. We have lost our 2 sons. Are you telling us this as good news? Father, you have not accepted many things in life. My elder brother wanted to study. Did not you stop his studies for the sake of us? Did not my mother quit the job to stay close to her children? You did these things against your liking. What is wrong in marrying, though I do not like it? To get rid of fear & sorrows. There is no way other than this, father. Instead of that it is better we die. Mother. I cannot hand you over to that scoundrel. If you want us to be happy, do as I say. I withdrew this money from my P.F for your marriage. I have also got your certificates. Take them & go for away from us. But, where father? Look... Look, how many letters your uncle had written from America for you? He has written that you are studying well and... You are the cleverest of all and he wanted us to send you there. Since, I did not like to send you so far away. I had hidden these letters from you in the bureau. Go... go to your uncle is place. Let is live with a hope that you are at least alive. Father, how can I leave you... I have taken this decision after a deep thought. There is no other way go. Every morning, Sun enters into life of everyone. But that scoundrel will enter our lives. - Go... go... - No. Father. Do not say a word. If everything goes well, we will come there. - Go... go... - Go... go... What are you doing there? Unload the goods. Swapna, stop. Is anyone here? What is this? Why are you running away like this? What will happen to me? I dreamt that we got married & your brothers are reborn as our sons. Come... why have you hung down your head? Do you feel shy to look into my eyes? Then, look into my heart. I love you. It is true. Hereafter, do not cry. Come. Come. Come... Many happy returns of the day lollipop.-Thank you. Mother, brother is on line from Kurnool. Will you talk to our mother? There is not much time left. The match will start in few minutes. Inform mother that I will leave by evening, okay? Okay... okay, all the best. I am buying lollipops for you. I will not forget. Bye. He has hit Obul Reddy at Konda Reddy bridge in broad day light. Who is he? He is definitely not from Kurnool. Hey! They are here. His henchman are here, they will. Start... Where do you want to go? Do not know. They are coming. Hey, search in the bushes. Make sound in the water. They are over there. Catch them. Search them here... Do not risk your life for me. Go away. They are demons. They will kill you. I will consider it as my fate. Go away. Please. It is not manliness to run before the war is over. I came to your place to play Kabaddi. But now, I have come to know that. I should play here and not on the ground. Who are you? Huh? It is wrong... it is wrong. You rob 1 crore from me. I can earn it again. Take 10 kg gold. I will buy it again. How can you take my heart? Hey, she is my heart... Life... Wife My darling. I love... If Swapna... If Swapna is lightning, I am the thunder. If Swapna is festival design, I am the flower on it. Like an ox stamping the flower. Will you dare to stamp my heart? How dare you hit me at Konda Reddy Burge centre in Kurnool? I will not kill you normally. I will shred you to pieces & consecrate our love with your blood. Cut any part of his body which you want. Go back... go back. I do not know whether the life of the black magician is in the parrot or not. I know that your life is in her. As your life is important to you, my life is more important to me. No... No... I cannot bear if Swapna gets hurt. Ask anything you want. I will give you but no... no... Hey, come here. Come... Come here... he has come. Remove your dhoti. Remove it. Hey remove it... he has removed it... Leave her. He has removed it. Spread it. Spread it. Throw all your sickles over here. Throw them all. Throw them all... They have thrown them all. Leave her. Pack them... I have packed them. Leave her... Blood... Leave her. Hey, you come here... come here. Come here, he has come. Throw this into that Gypsy. Except that, deflate all other vehicles. Go, take away. Go...& deflate all vehicles, deflate. They have thrown the sickles. They have deflated all vehicles. Leave her... leave her. You go & sit in the Gypsy. Take the knife... Take it... "Making courage your breath..." "keep going brother." "Swimming through an ocean..." "isn't any easy." "A tender beauty who wished to reach an auspicious place..." "has now got this ride as a friend in chaos." "Just this one man is like an army protecting you." "Keep travelling forward." "Don't fall back my friend." "Keep going." "Only time should know about how the story turns in the future." "The fight should decide what's the win that has to come." "Just this one man is like an army protecting you." "Making courage your breath..." "keep going brother." Get in. Where else should I phone up? He is neither in relatives house nor in friends house. - It is okay. Get down. - I told him that if he wins this match... His life will change. Did he listen to us? He did not go to the match at all. Where is your son? We thought of honouring his talent... When the officers were saying that when he cannot attend the match, what they could do, I felt ashamed. That is my father. It is about me. Oh God! Since he was going to play kabaddi, I gave him money for pocket expenses. That is my mother. She is very good. Wash your face. You have made him fit for nothing by giving money. If we are lenient, he will complaint about others. You believe whatever he says and support him. Do you know what he had told to that girl in the bank? It seems he said my father is unable to forget you. She called me up & expressed her grief. She said sorry sir, I ca not cheat my husband. Not just one headache... For him to win the match. I even went to temple & prayed for him. Look Vasundhara, do not stop me today. Today I'll see his end. Yes daddy. Do not spare him today. He has become a big headache for me. No one will react so silly in one is career related matter. She is my sister. Very dangerous. Let me see what excuse, he will give. Let him give any excuse. I will not forgive him. Is anything more important than his career? Let him come. He is finished today. Do you want it? I will go & show my face to them. You be here itself. Beat me... Beat me... If any one comes back from a tournament without playing... any father will get angry, not only you. Beat me, father! Beat me black & blue. You did not beat me, when I threw away my S.S.I.C marks list. You did not beat me when I faked fever & did not attend intermediate exams. Before mother asks if you had done it earlier, would he have become like this. Beat me, father. Beat me! Stop this overacting. Why are you hurt? Giving up the match. Did you unnecessarily get involved in some trouble? No! I had practiced little too much. Practicing for a never playing match. It is not time to joke, Asha. Please. Really, fathers have great expectations from their sons. Father who never visits temple would have prayed for me. How is that? You are repeating father is words perfectly. Only a son can understand a father is heart. How can a daughter understand it? They grow up under him for 18 years. After that they will marry and go to their In-law is place. That is what you do, do not you? Why are you getting angry on me after not playing a match? Am I a fool to come back without playing the match? I knew after reaching Kurnool that this will decide my Nationals fate. But I told you to tell this to father, when I wished you on your birthday. Did not you tell him? When did you tell me? You might have forgotten in your birthday party. Okay, let bygones be bygones. Father, this time I will definitely win National Cup. I promise on Asha. I do not have faith in you. Do not promise on me. - I promise on you. - No son! You promised to get state rank in 10th class on Grandma. Poor Grandma! That is... Grandma was little hasty. I promise on you father. Mother, father, I am dying in hunger. Oh mother, serve me food. What happened to my pooris? Which Puri? Amrish Puri or Om Puri? Eating Pooris! You might have eaten it. No, you might have eaten it. Look at my plate. My Pooris are here only. What might have happened to my Pooris? You are cheating me. Mother look, brother has taken away my Pooris. Why do you want to eat Puri? Eat rice! What happened to my Pooris? Thieves have stolen it. Why are you behaving like a child? Just now, you eat it, father. Mother, serve him curd rice. I am finished with my meals. Take Pooris... It will taste good. My mother is a good cook. - Drink water. - Not me. Who is that? - Who is that? - It is me, father. Shall I bring water? I will come myself. Take water! Drink! I will go inside & drink. Why am I hearing 2 hiccups? I hurt my vocal cords in practice! If anyone practices too much, He is likely to hurt his spinal cord. How could you hurt your vocal cord? Yes, is not it? That is father... Laddu strangled my neck. Swapna, no need to worry anymore. I will make all arrangements for you to go to America. I will apply for your Passport or Visa tomorrow. As your parents had wished, you can go to your Uncle in America and study well. Okay? Do not worry anymore, sleep well. Good night. Hey, you big boy! Have you come here to attend a function? Instead of beheading the man who had hit your brother, And throw his head at your brother is feet. What is the use of you being a Home Minister? You have 10 cars, Police & Security following you. Yuck! - Who dared to hit my brother? - I do not know. Where will he be? Do not know! Shit! Do you know in which direction he went? - Towards Hyderabad. - Hyderabad! I will make Police search from Ramoji film city to Ranga Reddy Dist. Border. I will bring her & conduct your marriage. That is manliness. Now, you have proved that you are my son. Son, consider that you are married to her. First, his death. Then, my marriage. Hey! You have stamped on the tail of a snake. That Obul Reddy is no ordinary man. Obul Reddy means...? By any chance, he is not Siva Reddy is brother, is he? Siva Reddy? Who is he? Your father is boss, the Home Minister. The entire state is under his thumbs. It is impossible to escape from him. Anyway, you have sent away that girl, have not you? If you are careful for few days, that is enough. How am I to send her? Do not you want a passport & Visa for it? That means... That girl is still... where is she? I have hidden her in the wardrobe of my room. In your home? You are father is a strict disciplinarian. It is like you are hanging between the devil and the deep sea. How could you hide her in your house? I thought! It is the safest place for the present. It is very difficult to send her to foreign in present situation. Getting passport & Visa is not so easy. Getting passport easily is not difficult for us. Hey Ajay! Instruct us what is to be done at which time. Though, we had lost the Kurnool match. We must win this game. Yes. You had put entire Hyderabad to shame. Yuck. How could you come back here shamelessly? - Who are you to sneer at us? - You carry on. You should have shown your prowess on the ground. These boys are back streets heroes, they are zeros on the ground. Why do you want to enter National Level Competitions? Why ca not you be just street dogs? Do not jeer at us like girls, if you have guts, let is decide it. Come... Why are you stopping me? They are making fun of us. Not now. What happened to you? Are you yourself? Am I not saying, not now? Should we keep quiet then? You all are not just unfit to play, even to fight also. May be they had got castrated in Kurnool. They are sneering & jeering at us & we are taking all like eunuchs. More than losing the game, their words are making me furious. Do not you know about my not temper. Till that girl leaves Indian shores for America, At any cost we must not turn attraction towards us. Save all this temper and use it when the occasion arises. Great Acid Batch! Do not ever cross swords with Soda batch again. What happened to them, buddy? They never used to tolerate even a word of fun. Do you think something really had happened in Kurnool? Something must have happened in Kurnool. I have alerted all city border check posts. I have put on traffic police also on duty. He cannot escape from our trap. We have handed over the case to the best officers in the Department. Sir... sir... What are you all doing? Is your Police Department sleeping or is it working? He is sleeping & accusing the department. Check every lane and by lane of Hyderabad. I am not able to beat to see to my brother, Someone has eloped with my brother is future wife. - Not eloped, but kidnapped. - Kidnap... Kidnap. I do not know how you will do it. In 24 hours, find the girl & finish him off. Take it, change to this dress. What happened to the girl is passport? I do not want to hear all that crap manage it yourself. Mother. I will call you later. I had kept my dress on the bed here, where is it? What dress? I had kept it here only. Why do I find you always in my room? Ca not you use the bathroom of mother is bedroom? It was yellow dress. I had kept it here only. You are stressing on yellow dress. Did you promise anyone that you will come in that dress? Hey, you keep quiet. This is my wardrobe. How many times do I have to tell you not to touch it? Okay, I should not touch it. That is all, is not it? Mother. Why did you shout like that? To scare you. Got scared, did not you? You went little over board. Did you see? My dress. It is here only. Here. Here... here... Ajay, have this juice. - Is your practicing going on well? - It is going on well, mother. Finish your juice and give me the glass. - I will bring the glass... You go out. - You finish it first. You go out, I will bring it. What is it, mother? - Move away. - What? Move.

You will call me right? Who are you all? - Sir, sweets. - No thanks. Come to the matter. Oh! Are you a Sugar Patient? No, jaggery patient, I may have anything. Why are you worried?

Ajay, cops have seized the Gypsy in which you brought Swapna from Kurnool. What are we going to do now? What are you boys doing here? Seeing a crowd here... Curiosity brought us here. What is there to see here? Go & practice your game. Till now, we were practicing. Do not just make empty promises about winning cups. You must win & show it.

If you want occupy this room also. Save me from this crisis. Please. You both go to the terrace immediately. - If anyone comes in, I will manage. - Thanks lollipop.

But, still do not give up your hopes. If you need, request Task Force is support also. - Okay sir. - Go. You never go home through right path, that saved you the day. - Buddy, dogs failed to find anything. - Ajay, no clues were found. - The girl is safe, is not she? - Safe. Did not I warn you earlier your father is a dictator? Not to keep that girl in your house. We have been saved because police were misled. By the way, where is that girl? Swapna. Where are they? Look there, come quickly. Then, I will take Swapna with me & finish the Visa work. You keep track of National Games proceedings. Okay, buddy. Did not I tell you my brother had brought a girl from Kurnool? This is that girl. The dress she is wearing also mine, you know that? Come, shake hands with her. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. - How cute... What is this? Do you think the girl is a doll? Says how cute! Why did you bring all your gang? Is there anyone yet to know, have you finished telling the entire town? You shut up. Swapna, you do not worry we all are with you. - You come to school with us. - To school? - No need to be patient any more. Laddu. - Yes, buddy.

But, do not cry today. Turn back and see. Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday dear Swapna... - Happy birthday to you... - Date of birth. So, today is your birthday. Blow it. Lollipop, what are you watching? Offer her cake. Happy birthday. For whom did you bring this? Thank you. "Tell me oh breeze." "Teasing my heart warmly." "Tell me oh breeze teasing my heart warmly." "Where is the sport of the spring?" "Take me with you and show me." "Where is the sport of the spring?" "Take me with you and show me." "Tell me oh breeze teasing my heart warmly." "Where is the sport of the spring?" "Take me with you and show me." "Where is the sport of the spring?" "Take me with you and show me." "The galaxies that shine like lamps of hope." "The wishes that bloom like sweet dreams." "When they travel along with us..." "Every step rushes like a wave." "Though the night still surrounds." "All I see is light." "When the eyes that spread wings flying in the lookout for dawn..." "keep shooting piercing the directions, can the darkness stop them?" "The raining Holi of scents..." "doesn't it show the sport of spring." "Doesn't the raining Holi of scents..." "show the sport of the spring." "Tell me oh breeze." "Teasing my heart warmly." "Like the story of the banks of river Yamuna is heard." "Like the pair of Radha and Krishna is seen." "Let me sing in the moonlight today." "Like Shehnai played in the ear."

"Take me with you and show me." Sir, we must start the consecration also. You take bath and come, sir. You will be dead next moment. Now, he is in Love meditation. He will not take bath. You consecrate it with milk. Milk... Milk... Consecrate it with Milk. Yes, it is me Dhoondy. Yes, what you heard is true. It is that girls idol only. You heard about temple built for Amitabh in Kolkata & Khushbu in Tamil Nadu. Obul Reddy is praying that girl like a Goddess. Offerings? Is it Lord Sathyanarayana is prayer to offer offerings? Do not spread this news. I will cut the line now. What is this sir, he is wasting 100 litres of Milk, 50 Litres honey & 50 Litres ghee. He can give it to a poor man like me, cannot he? If you go and give him this idea. He will drain out all your blood & consecrate the idol with it. The problem is not that. The entire State is eagerly waiting, when he will take bath. Elder son. Have you finished your meeting in A.C. Rooms? How many more days will you keep on searching that girl? He is going madder with every day passing. I feel he will turn into a stone praying madly. This is turning to be a futile exercise. Shall I get Lorry loads from Jammalamadugu & Allagadda? They will go on behead people, till they find that boy. I am giving you just one more day. Find her, bloody fool! You follow me. Did you hear that? If the matter goes to her, this will be the style. You do not know about my mother. C.M had offered me Ministry of Home after meeting her. - She will do what she says, be careful. - You take this sir. That girl is photo is in this, take it. Oh! What is bad dream! Who is this girl? Looks like new to this area. This was the girl who was dancing with Ajay recently. Why is she coming out at this hour? Is this girl having any connection with Ajay is change of heart? Let's ask her. What is Kurnool's code? 08... 08518 that side. What is it? What are you doing here? We came out for a tea. Finished your tea, is not it? Go... go home. - Where is your home? - Nearby only. - Come, I will drop you. - No problem, I will go myself. My house is also nearby only. Come, I will drop you and go. One minute. - You go now and come back early morning. - Sir, take the cover. Come. I never saw you in this street. We have come here recently. Uncle, I will go. This area is not that safe, no problem. I will drop you at home. Come. - This is my house. - This one? Yes. I will go now, uncle. I had come up to here. Come, I will hand over you to your people & go. - Thank you uncle, good night. - This boy? My would-be. Would you please give me some water? Looks like he is a sticky fellow. He is not leaving me. Please come in. Please come in... Please sit down. Please, give him company. Come... You keep talking to each other, I will get water for you. Hi Asha... Asha, She is his younger sister. Greet uncle! Hey, greet uncle. Greetings, uncle. I will get water for you. - Who is this girl? - It seems she is his fiancée. It seems she is her sister-in-law. - What are you to her, then? - Mother-in-law. Mother-in-law... mother-in-law. Nice, good team. What is all this meeting prospective bride at night? Stop feeling shy. She is beautiful even when I see her with sleepy eyes. What have you studied? Do you know to sing & dance? You might be knowing it all. My mother-in-law talks very funnily. What is all this meeting prospective bride? Marriage is nearing. What is all this? Have you fixed the marriage without informing me? They had informed me also, just now. Hello, why is not the groom saying anything? Sir, will you marry here or in your father-in-law is place? Why do you want to know all that? I mean, why you want to know it now? Poor uncle, I think he has plenty of leisure time. He is sticking around here without going to his home. He asked for water... If I give... he will go... Give me your hand. Ca not you help me without standing & watching fun? Not me... help him. You had to face unnecessarily problems in your home also for me. It is quite common to me. You do not worry about it. Looks like National games are also fast approaching. You do not seem to be practicing also. For the present, I do not have one goal, but two goals. To send you to America and win the cup. Where am I to hide you? I must hide you secretly like Sorcerer hiding Princess in a one pillar palace. Swapna... Swapna.. Come here... - Oh God! I am getting crazy ideas. - What ideas? Do you feel like presenting the crescent moon to me? I feel like scratching my back with it. "Whatever spell you cast on me." That's nice! After that? Just a minute... - Do you feel cold? - No. Give me your chunni. Give me, I am feeling cold. Magic? Did I do? Whatever spell you cast on me. Oh Heart! Tell me the truth. "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Let this moment last forever." "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Let this moment last forever." "Hey! Let the sunlight listen to the music behind the night." "Ask your heart who called it." "There's no magic that can stop time." "Does it know that this sweet magic is yours." "Both the heart and the magic are yours." "Both the call and answer are yours." "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Let this moment last forever." "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Let this moment last forever." "How naughty is this silent heart?" "It's talking out all secrets." "It says all these days in my eyes..." "you are the dream that always existed." "Hey! Let the sunlight listen to the music behind the night." "Try asking your heart why is it scared?" "When did the dream awaken in the blue sleeping eyes?" "And do you know what that dream is in search of?" "Both the eyes and dreams are yours." "Both the call and answer are yours." "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Let this moment last forever." "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Let this moment last forever." "Oh! How timid is this crazy heart!" "It wants to ask you if you like me." "With the unstopping hope, and unable to take a step further." "It's like a turbulent flow of a wave." "Hey! Let the sunlight listen to the music behind the night." "Ask your heart which direction is the air running." "Which way it has taken and which destiny has it reached" "and whether it knows which shore it wants to reach." "Both the step and run are yours." "Both the call and answer are yours." "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Let this moment last forever." "Whatever spell you cast on me." Suddenly, I feel asleep. Song is over? Yes. Looks like day is breaking in. By the way, I forgot to tell you, your visa is ready. Your flight is scheduled at tomorrow afternoon. Yes sir, we saw her. The man you are searching Ajay is none other than son of DCP Vijay Varma. He lives in old city area. Yes sir, very near to Charminar. Swapna... I love you. I think he will now take bath. Hey, search everywhere. He will be somewhere here only. Hey DCP, come out. Come out. Mr. Obul reddy, what is this? Do you know in whose house you are creating trouble? Do not ask me that question. Ask your son, he will answer. He will say father, I have eloped with his fiancée, he might have come for her. I do not have any interest in anything other than a girl is body. For the first time, in my life, I fell in love. I have become mad for her. She has mesmerized me. I cannot see anything else. I can see only that girl and your son, who eloped with her. I will see his end. Bro, there is a way from the room to the terrace. - Hey Bulli... - Bro. This place is awesome. One side I feel like eating sweet betel with my darling Swapna. Other side I feel like hanging your son's head to the Charminar. Hey DCP... you must have seen the inter religion people fighting. But you haven't seen the people from the same caste killing each other in our city. I'm giving you one day of time. I'll see your end if you fail to deport your son and my would-be. Why are you staring like this? Both these son and the father are scoundrels. Careful. He kidnapped my lover. You'll get punished for the mistake commited by them. I'll not bash anyone instead I'll kill. Hey! Come. - Ajay. - Are tickets reserved? Yes. Reporting time is exactly at 3.20 P.M. Ajay, situation is very serious. Obul Reddy has warned your father to hand over you & Swapna in 24 hrs. Buddy, your father called us to Police station & interrogated. Though we hoarsely cried we do not know, he never cared. Beat us also. On one side Police & Obul Reddy is men on the other side. They have swarmed all over the city. Our area is out of bounds for us. Leave alone taking her to the Airport. Even going out of this neighbourhood is also impossible. I suspect they are watching all our movements. They have influence in the higher echelons of power. I do not have any doubts over it. We will be careful. Keep these with you. Leave this place quietly, as strangers. Give me information about their movements. We will meet again in the Airport at 3 PM. That girl must leave this place, at any cost. I feel very sad on hearing about leaving us. We had come closer in a short period of time. What are you going to study in America? Do not know! I must decide after reaching there. When will you come again? Do not know. Will you come back? Do not know. Can you not continue your studies here only? What? Are you making her to cry? When she is going to foreign to study. What is your problem? Do you want a lollipop? Not only me, even she is crying. You see this. Do you also want a lollipop? That is your talent. You can make anyone to cry. What about your talent, then? Is it not to understand anyone? No, to remain an enigma. I mean, I am going way, am I not? Are not you feeling sad? Why should I? It is a happy news. I feel very sad. To leave you, your house, your people & friends. I am not able to go away. Then, I am also feeling sad. You are going away, are not you? There will be no more chases, tensions and adventures. But, I will get the National Cup. Is it necessary to discuss all this in these tense moments? Your clothes are in this bag. I think you did not eat anything last night also. There are some eatables also in it. Change quickly & come down. We must escape from here before the security guards change for duty. Buddy, phone. We are in a fix. Police have found your hiding place. What happened, buddy? Buddy, there is only one hour for the reporting time. You take Asha and leave this place immediately. Ajay, listen to me carefully. Surrender yourself! You have been surrounded by Police. You cannot escape from them. Are you listening to me? Ajay, you do not have any other option. Surrender. - What day is today? - Friday. I am not crying, am I? Great joke! What is going to happen here every Friday at 1.45 PM? You can watch it in few minutes. Sit down. Hello... hello... answering hello... Catch him. Ajay, police are after you. Come on Ajay, come on. Sir, it is time for Muslims to offer prayers, they are going for it. It is highly sensitive area. If you fire at them and if any untoward incident happens... Then, go & search them. All of you. Kurnool goons are behind you, watch out! Ajay, Obul reddy's goons are near to the Patel market. Cops are near the bike, take Pathargatti road immediately. - Ajay... - Tell me. - Ajay... Ajay... - Hold on for a minute. Hold this. Give it to me... Tell me now. Van is ready at the Begumpet bus stop. AP21C 2244 is the number. Do not take the risk of travelling long distance on a bike. Swapna, come & sit. Don't worry. We will go. Okay? "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Let this moment last forever." "Whatever spell you cast on me." "Let this moment last forever." What is the time left for reporting? - We have 40 minutes. - Are we left with 40 minutes? Fine. We still have 40 minutes. What is it now? I want to eat. Panipuri? Are you insane? We are getting late to the flight. Please, we still have 40 minutes right? So please... Make it fast. Can you please give her what she wants? Ok sir. Hello, no we are nearby. We will be there in 15 minutes. Okay. No, there is nothing to worry. Okay. Hey, there was a girl here. Where is she? She went there after eating. Where did you go? Here itself, for shopping. What is there to shop now? How can you go without informing? Do you know how worried was I? You aren't even tensed as I am. Is it you are me who is going? Knee cap. You missed a match for my sake. I'm giving this knee cap to you as my remembrance that you must win this match. Best of luck. Is it time for that? Okay come. Swapna, in few hours from now, you will be... You have a feeling of void and a little disappointment, have not you? Your face is giving in. I do not want you to go with that feeling. So, I have a little surprise for you. You had accused me of not able to understand a woman is heart, had not you? Look at there. My child Swapna! It is not good for them to stay here for a long time. Go and drop them. Swapna, it is time for your flight. Swapna, this is your passport. Take the boarding pass after going inside. Since, yours is a student visa, there will not be much formalities. Your certificates & balance money are in this. Will you buy clothes on reaching there? Okay? I forgot something. Oh! I have got it. I talked to your uncle last night. They will come to the Airport to pick you up. I have written their phone numbers here, okay? No confusion, is not it? Will you call back on reaching there? Call your father. They will be relieved to hear you. Will you travel carefully? You are not a small girl, are you? Time is up, get inside. Bye. Give me the bike keys. We must start practice immediately, we will go to the ground. Come on, get going. Swapna, come & sit. Knee cap. I cannot go away leaving you. I am not able to go. I want you. I feel like spending all my life with you. I cannot cheat myself and go away. If you are with me, I will not be afraid of anyone. I cannot say any more. I want you. Take him away. Ajay... Ajay... Did you hear my advice when I told you not to get involved in unnecessary trouble. At last! What have you achieved? You reached up to the finals of State level championship, To help someone you gave up the game and cheated us. Later, you said you will play for the Nationals. What happened? Tomorrow night it is Finals for National Cup and you are here, behind the bars. Are not you ashamed? What's up aunty? How am I looking? You would drag me if I tell you. Good one. Don't put an evil eye on her. You're lucky. You seem like your father no matter you comb your hair or not. Keep this aside. Go to the girl and convince her. We should make her bride, tomorrow 11 in the night is the marriage right? So that she doesn't suicide in the meantime, go and make a friendly relationship with her. I love you. What is this? I thought you will be crying but you are eating country chicken. Why should I cry? Yes, I cannot bear to see you cry, can I? - Will you eat this leg piece for me? - No. I have finished. What gift do you want for our marriage? I will ask my husband & tell you. - Your husband? - Yes, that man only. One who is smart. Do you not remember him? That day in Kurnool... in Konda Reddy Burj centre. Beating you black & blue. One who had taken me? Ajay... did you forget him? Is it? I left him since he appeared like a young boy. But, he is now caught. By now he would have got admitted into some hospital. Oh Reddy! Why would he be in some hospital? One who could take me from you in our town. Cannot he come here? He will come. He will take me along with him. He will marry me. You can also come & bless us. Do you have so much faith in him? I was with him all these days. Do not I know his capacity? Bloody. I planned to have at least one woman after marriage. Situation is not favourable to me. Hey, come here. Come here, I will show you my capacity. - Capacity... Capacity. - Leave me. He is always like this. He cannot stop himself once he gets into the mood. You all go to your rooms and close the doors. - You go ahead, son. - Come... Come... Where are you going away? You wanted to see my capacity, did not you? - Come, I will show you my manliness. - Leave me. You are thinking its manliness to enjoy a woman against her wish. That is not manliness. A woman must desire a man on her own. I desire Ajay like that. He is a real man. If you have guts. If you are really a man. You win over him & marry me. Then, I will accept you as a man. If it happens, I will become your wife. Before that, if you marry me forcibly like a coward. Even if you touch me. It will not be you, who will appear before me but Ajay. "All the married women get this girl bathed in auspicious waters." "Say may Lord Rama grace you and remove all evil eyes on this girl." "My body shines in anticipation of my beloved husband."

Let her feel, later on there will not be anything to feel shy. I want him. A case has been booked on him. I had complained against him. I am withdrawing my complaint. I want him. Come. DCP, are you worried about your son? I am not worried about my son. I am worried about you. Go... Your father and that girl are boasting a lot about you. Are you that strong? She challenged me that she would marry me if I win over you. That is the reason I thought to finish you and marry her. Do you have cigarette? He know that he will be dead. Hey! It's his last wish. Give him the cigarette. This place is awesome. Stop the vehicle here. Hey! Bring the knives and the sickles. Come guys. He had escaped in Kurnool. Now, take away any part you like from his body. Did you see classical film Patala Bhairavi? I had seen it 10 times. In that film, Sorcerer plans behead Thota Ramudu. But Thota Ramudu beheads the Sorcerer. Is it? Then, am I the Sorcerer & he the Thota Ramudu? But that is not possible here. You are surrounded by my men. And they are surrounded by my men. Any man wearing a white dress is not a factionist. This is not Kurnool. This is old city. Cover him up with this. - Tonight, we are winning the National Cup. - Yes. Then, what about Swapna? If the groom is here. How will she get married? What shall we do with him? Bring him to the Stadium. He will watch, our match. National games 2002 kabaddi finals. In few moments from now match between Andhra Pradesh & Punjab will begin.

Andhra Pradesh Team is captain Ajay will take the first bow. Starting an assault on the opponents on the left side. He is trying to force his way into by breaking the cordon. With great acumen, trying to forge ahead. True! Obul Reddy is not in the Marriage hall. - Hey Dhoondi. - Sir. Any news? I have called everyone I know. I am waiting for reply. - Hey!

You have not gone mad, have you? Look, everyone have assembled here. It will not be good. You come here immediately and marry her. We will take care of him later. Yuck, bloody woman. How could I be born as your son? The girl who challenged my manliness. How can I marry her like a eunuch? Bring her here. Bloody, I will show her the manliness of Rayalaseema. Marriage is not here... there. Last ride. Punjab is safely in winning position with higher points. To bring victory to Andhra with great support & applause from spectators. Ajay takes to the field.
