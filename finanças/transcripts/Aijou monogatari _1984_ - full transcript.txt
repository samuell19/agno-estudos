DANCING IN THE NIGHT- Jill Colucci - Hold this for a moment. - All right. Oh, excuse me. Let me see... Come, let's go! Uh-huh, sorry for the wait. What about the ballet? - I'm going to quit it. - But you worked so hard... It's fine. I'm done with classical music. The musical was fantastic, wasn't it? Yeah, I guess so... I've already made up my mind. I'll do my best for the audition. Say, let's go get something nice to eat, all right? They say that normally a stepmother is supposed to treat her child. But I just did that. I took you to the musical because it's your birthday. But you also enjoyed it. Might as well! Now, I got to hurry back to the shop. Come on! Say, do you want to drop by the shop? Uh-uh. It won't hurt if you help out a little. I need to be home for when the flowers arrive. Really? You buy the groceries then. I'm sorry for being late. It sure is late... Uh? The flower bouquet from Daddy-Long-Legs. Ah! Don't put any carrots. Coming! I'm from Aoyama Florist Shop. - Here. - Thank you very much. Thank you. 6... 8... 10... 2... 4... 6... 16! I'm finally 16-years-old. Say, Mom, will he be upset that I quit ballet? Who? Daddy-Long-Legs. Why would he be? I mean, the person who abandoned me together with these red pointe shoes wanted for me to learn ballet, right? Who knows. The person who sends you flowers and the one who abandoned you might be a different person. Uh-uh, I'm sure it's the same person. I have a hunch that it is so. MEDITATION FROM THAIS - Jules Massenet TROUBLE - Carmen Grillo YOU COULD BE THE ONE - Heather Huffman It fits. They finally fit. Now I can go meet Daddy-Long-Legs. I'm home. You're home? Don'tjust stay in the dark, then. What's wrong? What's the matter? They fit... Mom. They fit perfectly. You promised me, didn't you? When these shoes... When these shoes that were with me when I was abandoned would fit me... For Daddy-Long-Legs... You said I could go search for the one who might be my dad. However, there are things in this world that are better left unknown. But, but... You promised me when I was little. Welcome. That's strange. For your birthday flowers to not be delivered... Just give me a moment. Ms. Nakamichi, right? Nakamichi... It's March the 24th. The 24th? Oh, found it. Is it there? Yes, it says that it was delivered. To Ms. Miho Nakamichi. Really? Here, take a look. The sender is "Mr. Takuji Shinozaki from Nomachi, Kanazawa City, Ishikawa Prefecture". This is the person who sent you flowers, right? That's right. Can I copy this? I have to send him a thank you letter. Go ahead. What's this "Oura Flower Shop, Nagasaki City"? Oh, this happens often. He must've sent them from Nagasaki while writing his Kanazawa address. We are never mistaken. Thank you very much. Not at all. You seem to be having fun. It's because I'm going to meet my Daddy-Long-Legs. Daddy-Long-Legs, huh? I really hope you do. And perhaps, he might even be my real dad. He must've had his reasons. So you better not get your hopes up. There are things... I've heard that already. I'll come back, no matter what. You mean, you still intend to live with me? You don't like that? Ah-ah... I want to live my springtime of life too. Springtime of life? That's right. I picked you up when I was 25 and stayed single this whole time. There's no way a woman with a child would be popular. Do you regret picking me up? Absolutely not! I was all alone, so you just saved me from boredom. You always act tough. Here we go. When will you come back? No idea. But not until I'm satisfied. If I can't find him in Kanazawa, I might go all the way to Nagasaki. It's not an endless trip, so don't wander around aimlessly. Uh-huh, I know. I also have this. What's that? My application for the audition. The audition is in a little over a week, so I'll be back until then. Oh. I'm not a fortune-teller, but... Your fate line is so-so. You have no intellect line. What about my luck with money? Why you! Be careful. Uh-huh. Then, off I go. ZAZIE DANS LE METRO - Tomoyo Harada Excuse me, sir. This Nomachi 5-2... That's... You go straight ahead, then... Excuse me. Where can I find Nomachi 5-2? Thank you very much. Excuse me. Excuse me. It's no good. What's wrong? This soil is no good. Really? I kind of like it, though. The touch or the texture, it's just not right. It doesn't seem like that to me. I'm going on a trip. Huh? Why? I also want to visit some potteries here and there to study. But I want to find a soil that suits me. "Here and there", you say? Anywhere specific? Well, Tobe or Imari. Somewhere around that area. That's also where the roots of this Kutani ware are. Well, just leave the shop in my care. Um... Excuse me. Yes? Um, is Mr. Takuji Shinozaki here? Ah, that would be me. My name is Miho, Miho Nakamichi. I'm the Miho Nakamichi that Mr. Takuji Shinozaki sent birthday flowers to. I sent flowers... to you? Yes. You did, didn't you? No, I don't remember doing that at all. Then... What about the red pointe shoes? You must know about the red pointe shoes, right? Red pointe shoes? Please wait, I'll bring them right away. Oh no! It's not here. What do I do? What's wrong? My bag! My travel bag... Hey, that one? Is anything missing? The wallet? It looks like it's all empty. It's really, it's really not you? It's unfortunate, but you got the wrong person. But... Then why? Why was your name there? I have no idea why is that. I see. Just when I thought I finally met Daddy-Long-Legs. Daddy-Long-Legs? Like Webster's Daddy-Long-Legs? Yes. I started calling him that. It's getting cold. Yes, thank you. "I'm sorry" - Um... - Uh? Oh. Are you left-handed? When I was little. My mom made me switch, but I still use it sometimes. I'll lend you this. You can pay it back whenever you can. Use it to return to Tokyo. Thank you very much. But, is it okay if I were to pay you back a little late? I'd like to go to Nagasaki. The birthday flowers were ordered from a flower shop in Nagasaki. So, I'm sure if I go to Nagasaki... No. There are things in this world that are better left unknown. Uh? - Go back to Tokyo. - But... You should go back! Today, you should stay at the inn of one of my acquaintances. Shall we go, then? I'll be going on a trip tomorrow, so I'm sorry that I can't do anything for you. It's fine, thank you for all the help. This is it. It's already lunch time. Here you go. Hey, this is heading to Osaka. I know, the person who you were with yesterday told me. You went to my work place? Yes, I wanted to thank you. You're taking the 6 o'clock ferry to a place called Tobe in Shikoku and then you're going to Imari in Kyushu to search for soil. That right. Imari is around Nagasaki, isn't it? Please take me with you. I won't cause you any trouble. I promised my mom this would be the only time I'll look for Daddy-Long-Legs. So I really want to go to Nagasaki. You should go back to Tokyo. And also... I'm still not convinced that you're not him. I've already told you I'm not him. But you can't prove that, right? CHOTTO MATTE KUDASAI - Rosemary Butler Is there something wrong? I have an audition for a musical next week. I'll be back shortly. Big brother! You should listen to an adult. How many times must I tell you? Go back to Tokyo, understood? I can't take you in my travel. You sound like a dad... I'm sure this is how it's like when a dad scolds you, right? Excuse me for a moment. I DREAM OF LOVING YOU - Karen Tobin You took the 6 o'clock one? You waited here alone all this time? That was foolish. DANDELION - OSOZAKI NO TANPOPO - Tomoyo Harada Mr. Takuji! The tea is ready. Thank you. Miho? Let's drink some tea. All right. Let me do it. It's going to get dirty. Why don't you use that bandana instead? Uh? No, it's fine. All right, let's go. All right. Was it any help? Yes, all thanks to you. I first thought that she was your sister. But I immediately realized that's not possible. You have a younger sister? I think it's time to go. I see. - Thank you for everything. - Not at all. Excuse me. That was a nice bath. It's your turn now. All right. - I'm going. - All right. "To Haruko Nakamichi", huh? Well then. Is this his younger sister? - Ouch! - Ah... I'm sorry. Eh? The mattresses are so far... If you move them, you need to do it around this much. Thank you. We're finally going to Kyushu tomorrow. You should take a good rest. Yes. Good night. Thank you... "Younger sister, Mari, 18 years old at death" Why are you so quiet? Today is my birthday. WHAT CAN I DO - Kathi Pinto Stop it! Aren't you cold? Uh-uh. I'm actually hot. You'll get a cold if you don't wipe the sweat. It's fine. I'm fine. What is it? It's nothing, I'm fine. You're a little hot. It's because it's hot here. What if you caught a cold? Mr. Nakajima, I'll come back later. Sure, no problem. I'm sorry for hindering with your work. You don't need to worry about it. It's a light cold, so the doctor said it'll go away if you rest well. If you don't get well soon, I might run far from Nagasaki. - Okay. - Got it? I wonder if her temperature went down? CALL OF THE WILD - Rosemary Butler Something's changed. What do you mean? Something's definitely changed about you. How so? You're being kind to me... And you're also accommodating. Well, excuse me, then. Sorry. Did I upset you? Then, allow me to change that. Come on, bring it on. No, wait a second! No! WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN - Rosemary Butler Here. Your sister... She was a beautiful person. I'm sorry. I looked at her picture. I've always wanted to take her on a trip like this. Wow! I feel like it's about to suck me in. It was a suicide. Even though... it wasjust him and his younger sister living together. He only cared about himself and didn't do anything for her. "I'm sorry" was the only word she had left behind... Here you go. It's so cold. Now it's my turn. Here you go! It's delicious! Let's go tomorrow. Go? Where to? Nagasaki, of course. But, your soil... No, it's fine. I'm sorry for dragging you around. Now it's your turn. Really? Are you sure? Let's go find your Daddy-Long-Legs! Yes. Yes, I got it. - What are you doing? - What do you mean? With your hands. This? They say to hide your thumbs if you run into a funeral. Otherwise you won't be present when your parents pass away. Right? I really apologize for the inconvenience. After they were anonymously ordered at the center, they said that's not acceptable. Then, what about the payment? The money was delivered. But... Since it's weird to not have a sender name... So, I took a name from this book... How can you use someone else's name for that? It's fine, don't worry. Let's go. Thank you very much. What is it? It's me... That's me! What do you mean? Look, in that 753 photo. Doesn't that look like me? Is that so? I'm sure about it. My mom took lots of photos of me since I was very little to use them in finding the person who abandoned me. This child is me. All right. Let's go inside and ask. Excuse us! Yes? Yes, what is it? Excuse me... I would like to ask you about the photo outside in the window. About the photo outside? Um... I'm referring to that 753 photo. Oh... It's a good photo, isn't it? Um, who is the person in the photo? Well, that's Master Omori's daughter. - Master Omori? - Uh-huh. Is that little girl doing fine? Who knows? She suddenly stopped coming here for some reason. Do you know where that Mr. Omori lives? Yes. In a big mansion straight ahead from here. Everyone around here knows where it is. - Let's go. - Uh-huh. - Thank you very much. - Not at all. I feel like... I've already seen this scenery before. This is it. This house also... It seems familiar. Let's go inside. Wait... Wait a minute. Let me go alone. No, but... Please. I want to meet him alone. My Daddy-Long-Legs... The person who might be my father. Will you be fine? Then, I'll wait for you over there. I'm sorry for being selfish. It's fine. What is it? I would like to ask a few things. Um... Is the master home? May I have your name? I'm Miho. Miho Nakamichi. Please, come inside. Please, wait in that chair. These are mine. Who are you? They're mine... Wait a moment, please! I am sorry, but the master is busy and can't see you right now. Nakamichi. Please, tell him it's Miho Nakamichi. He'll know. I am sorry, but he won't see someone that he doesn't know. Please, leave. But that's... - Excuse me. - Hey! What are you doing here? Um... I'm... I'm Miho Nakamichi. So? I'm Miho. Miho Nakamichi. Miho Nakamichi. So, what do you want from me? Please, tell me. You send me flowers every year, don't you? Flowers? Yes. While using someone else's name. The one who sent me the red pointe shoes was you, wasn't it? Please, tell me. Miho, I'm sorry but since my wife is in such a state, you should leave. I... I saw it. The 753 photo with me. That person... Is she my mother? Please, tell me. What's that? Those are all pictures of me. Why are they here? I was picked up by my current mother when I was 3. Why are these in this place? This... For whom is this room? This place is a room for my wife. My wife... She started going crazy around the time she adopted you. Adopted? What are you talking about? Miho... You were adopted twice. Once by us. However... The second time was by your current mother. By Ms. Haruko Nakamichi. Miho... I couldn't leave you by my wife's side. Your mother and my wife were best friends in their student days. That's why I asked her. Under the promise that I'll never see you again. But instead... I got her to let me send you flowers for your birhtday. Then, my... What about my real parents? They both passed away in a traffic accident. That's when I adopted you. Miho. I'm sorry, but, I would like you to never come see us again. I... I want to live in peace with my wife. If you want to visit your parents' grave... No, thank you. My mother is still alive. So, the one sending flowers was you, wasn't it? Very well. For the flowers... Thank you very much. Good-bye. AIJOU MONOGATARI - Tomoyo Harada Even though it's our first time meeting, you seem familiar to me. This is the story of us passing by each other in the street at night. It was you who, before we met, I kept hearing in my heart calling for me. I want to go back to love. I burst into tears. I want to go back to love. A ray of sun gently shines on my heart. As if I was holding onto a protective charm, I've always believed that you'll come for me. Stop tears, stop. I wipe my cheeks onto your summer shirt. I want to go back to love. I was very lonely. In your invisible kindness, I believe. I want to go back to love. You stroke my hair. I want to go back to love. A ray of sun gently shines on my heart. What will you tell your mother? It would be pitiful to be harsh with her. It's fine. I'm an adult, after all. Perhaps the one who suffered the most may have been my mom. Thank you for taking care of me this past week. No. It's fine. Good luck at the audition. Hey, you need to hurry. It's fine, I can stay a little longer. Are you sure? You're going to lose your flight. Then, will you let me come with you again if that happens? You're continuing your travel, right? Uh-huh. But I've had enough. I have no idea how to handle a girl. Humph! Look, you make my point. Thank you very much. Good-bye. Thank you, Dad. Boo! Oh my. I'm back. Say, what do you want to eat tonight? Um... Beef stew would be nice. I see. It needs carrots too, right? What in the world has gotten into you? Say. This trip... I wonder what it meant to you. Um... I'd say it helped me finally pull out a big thorn that was stuck. I should have pulled it out for you. I'm sorry. What for? For preventing your springtime of life. It might not be too late for that. Mom. I am so very much like you, aren't I? How so? "How so", you ask? Come on. Aren't you Ms. Haruko Nakamichi, my one and only mother? You're careless, pushy, hasty... Um... What else? Mom, did I upset you? Are you sleeping? Good night. Good night. You came? Uh-huh. Are you alone? Uh-uh, I'm with my mother. Good luck. Yeah, but the other people seem to be so skilled. Be confident. All right! I'll give you a good luck charm. This here is the only present I got from my younger sister. I'll feel bad. No, it's fine. I want you to have it. I'm sure Mari would feel the same. Thank you. - Do your best. - Uh-huh. Then, I'll see you after. All right. Excuse me. Uh? Are you Mr. Takuji Shinozaki? Yes. You're Ms. Nakamichi, right? Yes. Thank you for taking care of Miho. She's in rehearsal right now.
