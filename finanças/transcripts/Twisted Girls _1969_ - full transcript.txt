'Isle of the Swedes' No, Maurizio. No. We're not resolving anything like this, Maurizio. I can't live without you. I promise that... Forget it. You've been saying it for years. And we always end up back at square one. Something wrong, madam? Something? You're an optimist. No, don't worry, I haven't escaped from an asylum. All told... A trip to the beach can't hurt, right? For your 100th argument you should get a prize. This is the last time. You can bet on it. I've had enough. It's impossible to understand Maurizio. Is that your island? Why do they call it Island of the Swedes? It's an old story that goes back years. - Where did you think you were going? - I was furious. I didn't know what I was doing. I'll take you out to buy something. In a few days. For now I don't want to see anyone. You can't wear any of this. And these? There are no men on the island. You're welcome. After that experience with Maurizio I'm immune to men. Manuela, it's ready. - The glasses. - I'll go. They're in the lounge. On the shelf behind the fireplace. This clock has lost its hands. I removed them. Who needs to know the exact time? Violent clashes in the suburbs of Saigon. According to American sources Vietcong losses number 43 dead and over 100 injured. America also suffered significant losses, 25 dead... We'll have to buy some new batteries. If you're afraid you'll lose count, don't worry. They always give a complete total at the end of the month. They don't forget anyone. Dead, wounded, deserters... Everyone. Eleonora. Where are you going? I'm coming with you. No, dear, I'll be back in 10 minutes. Tell me the truth, am I bothering you? Not at all, feel free to stay as long as you like. - Any news about your husband? - I think he remarried in Mexico. Why did you leave him? He'd become a stranger. It came to me all of a sudden, after years of love. I know he suffered a lot. He loved you. He loved success most of all. And me with my social position, I was just a means to get there. - Is it Maurizio? - Yes, it's Maurizio. It's very moving, listen. "I'm missing you more then ever and I want to be with you. " "The inevitable pains of true love. " "Now more than ever I'm sure I love you and that you love me. " One "I adore you", three "I love you", one "I don't want to lose you"... Four "my love". All on half a page. Unworthy of a fashionable architect. It seems like the gallant boyfriend's handbook. I bet he made various copies. He'll send me one a day. Eleonora! I haven't seen you for ages. What happened to you? Manuela, a friend of mine. It's her first time here. I would have noticed her. She's not your type. Don't even think about it. And don't tell me you're short of game. I thought about visiting you but I know you don't want anyone on your island. When I want to see someone I leave my den. - Where did you find the bullets? - At the bottom of the chest. Thank god you missed it. - I'm a fool, sorry. - Don't do that again, I don't like it. Life is precious. A mystery. There's still so much to learn. Please let me sleep with you. If I have to be honest, I thought you'd forgotten where I lived. - Your usual? - My usual. What a pleasant surprise. - Are you busy today? - Yes, but don't worry. I'll just make a few calls. We'll spend the day together. I've got a great day lined up. First stop, The Fisherman. Do you remember? It's a trendy restaurant now. - Then... - A trip on a sailboat. Some water-skiing, then we'll pop into the Barracuda for a drink. Unfortunately this place doesn't offer much, darling. What can I do? Show you my Chinese stamps or my butterfly collection? Admit it, you're lacking a bit of imagination. Even so, your itinerary always ends up here, at home. Why waste time? We're already here. You've changed, for the worst. Excuse me, I'm going to make those calls, I'll be right back. I took a shortcut. I hate going the long way. What are you up to? I know you well enough to know this isn't your style. You're unbearable when you try to think. You were born for something else. What's wrong? Why did you come here? Forgive me, but I can't. - I'll take you back. - No, thank you. - Where have you been? - Can't you tell? Shopping. Have you forgotten what day it is today? Congratulations, for your birthday. It's so hot. I drank too much, I need a bath. Aren't you coming? Please stop! Why did you come? Why didn't you reply to my letters? - Hello, Eleonora. - Hello, Maurizio. Please, come in. - Something to drink? - JB, thanks. - How long will you be staying? - It doesn't depend on me. - In that case you can leave right away. - You know how stubborn I can be. I won't leave without you. I'll write it down if you want. Better yet... I'll record it for you. If you haven't read my letters, I'll tell you, I love you and I need you. It's absurd that we broke up for such futile reasons. And out of childish spite. I'll say it again, I love you. Over and out. There's nowhere for you to sleep. Don't worry, I'm an obliging sort. - I'll think of something. - Okay, then. But there are no servants here. We all pull our own weight. As the log cutter I have a right to welfare, healthcare, and a pension. I've heard a lot about your splendid isolation. It took a lot of courage on your part. Courage? For the life I used to lead? Theatre premieres, concerts, bridge, parties. Deep down I was just another cog in the system. A golden cog, in a very expensive loft apartment. We live in a sick society, agreed. But that's the reality. You don't really think you can solve all your problems hiding here. If this is a type of protest, my compliments. Great effort with the mountain of money you've got. How long do you think you'll last? Alone, here. On this island. I don't know, but for now I like it here. And you... How long do you think you'll last? If I'm not mistaken you don't share Eleonora's temperament. I don't know, but for now I like it here. It's cold, dear. Okay, I'm going to bed. Goodnight. - Do you want some? - No, thanks. I need your help. I can't get through to her. Manuela listens to you, she looks up to you, she trusts you. You've got to help me make her see sense. See sense? What about? Hasn't it ever occured to you that she doesn't want you anymore? Simply. I don't believe it, I'm sure she'll come back to me eventually. - You're just a fling. - A fling? You're so pretentious. Always so sure of yourselves. Your power. You never take the time to find out what a woman's really feeling inside. She's yours, and that's enough for you. In any case, don't count on me. I'm going to bed as well, it's late. Goodnight. I need to talk to you. I really don't know what about. I thought I knew you well. Now I'm not so sure. - What's going on? - Nothing, anyway that's my business. What right do you have to interfere? They've offered me an important job. A residential centre in Brazil. - It's six or seven months. - I'm happy for you. I still haven't accepted, I want to know if you'll come with me first. - Isn't it Saturday today? - Yes, it's Saturday. Then we have to go to Franco's tonight, we promised. Naturally you'll come with us. Who the hell invented this stupid game? Eleonora, she says it's very popular in Patuasia. - It's exciting. - You think so? - Looking for a naked woman, then what? - You lack imagination, my dear. She's gone crazy, or she's completely drunk. You as well. What were you thinking? You know something? On second thoughts this game's getting rather interesting. Found anything? There was something different about Eleonora. Friend, we can go. We're crowding them now. There's nothing important, it's not even worth sending it back to him. Wait. "Sic transit gloria mundi. " Anything else? Just this. And this. All done. Perfect. I want to try first. Let me try. Good morning, madam. I have a message for you. That gentleman I brought here last time gave it to me. - Shall I bring the water up? - Yes, go ahead. - Wait for me. - Yes, madam. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Don't drink anymore. You don't need it. I swear I don't know what's going on anymore. I think I hate him. Then, when I see him, he talks to me. It's like he's still a part of me. Help me. You shouldn't have gone. You're right, I'll never be free of him, I have to accept it. He wants me to go with him. They've offered him a new job. In Brazil. He says we have to start all over again. But I'm happy here. I only want to be with you. But Maurizio wouldn't have to exist. I could never do it. Never. Calm down, and try to rest. What is it? What's going on? What do you think about going on a long trip? Us two, together. It's a marvelous idea. Yes, let's leave immediately. Tomorrow! Algeria, Casablanca, the Niger river, lake Chad, lake Tanganika. Cape Town. Zanzibar. Mombasa. Everything! I want to see everything! Come on, there are still a million things to do. It's Maurizio. No, I don't want to see him. I'll go. I've come to get Manuela. Wait, she doesn't want to see you. Keep out of it. - Let's talk. - About what? You're a dirty whore... and I really don't think there's anything you could say to me. You wouldn't have had the guts! Nobody will ever come between us now! Manuela, stop! Listen to me! I had to finish him off. I didn't have any other choice. Start bringing down the suitcases. If you haven't read my letters, I'll tell you, I love you and I need you. It's absurd that we broke up for such futile reasons. And out of childish spite. I'll say it again, I love you. Over and out.
