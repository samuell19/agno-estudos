BOMNAE FILMS I'm home. Yeah. I'm busy. Why? Yeah. The day after tomorrow? You're telling me this now? I can't go. Ji-young can't go. She has to go to work. All right. Okay, okay. I gotta go, gotta go. I'll call you later. Later. I will, bye. Yeah. Who was that? - My brother. - What's going on? It's my father's 60th birthday soon. You should go. How can I go? You should. I can't go. Is there anything to eat? - Eggs. - We have eggs? - Is this all we have? - Yeah. We have to finish the eggs. We can't take them with us when we move. - Is there anything else? - Anything else? No. - Just these? - Yeah. Try. He wants you to come too. Where? - To Samcheok. - Samcheok? What do you want to do? What shall we do? What shall I do? Did you get a haircut? Yes. - When? Today? - Yes. - Where did you get it? - The hairdresser's you went to last time. - The one I went to? - Yes. They do this kind of haircut? - Why? - Huh? - Why? - Nothing. - Is it bad? - It's cool. Stop it. How much did you pay for it? 138 bucks. 130? That is so cute. Should we get a cat? Us? Why? Should we get one? Us? Why not? Let's get one. It's really cute. Look. Do you know where we can adopt one? Where to adopt cat... I'll find out. I'm late this month. Really? Yes. Really? Yes. Are you sure? Yes, I am. How late are you? About two weeks. Isn't it sometimes late? It's late sometimes but it was never this late. - Never? - Never. Hold on, I'm going to get some water. THE FIRST LAP You don't know to get there? Isn't Incheon your home town? It's my first time on this route. Go straight? No, here. I think this is it. Here? Right here? - Right here? - Yes, we have to enter through there. Why couldn't you give me a heads up? I haven't used this map in a while. Let's use your phone later. GPS on my phone doesn't work. Incheon doesn't do it for me. It's too crowded. That's because you're from a small town. Are you underrating Samcheok? - Pull over here for a second. - Here? Why? Hello, sir. Is this a bad time? Well, today's payday, and I was wondering... I was wondering what time I would get paid. Oh, in the evening. Is there any chance I could get the money a little earlier? Yes, I'm working on the teaching material. Oh, in the evening. Hey! Could I get it a little earlier than that? Hey! Okay, all right. Thanks. - Where have you been? - I went to park the car. You could have just pulled over and waited. There wasn't enough room. - Did you get the test kit? - Yeah, I got it. What? What are you looking for? Where's the car? - Our car? - Yes. Didn't you just park it? - Can you hear it? - No. What an ordeal. What's the number of the apartment you're visiting? - Do you have the number? - Hold on. - Which apartment? - Just a second. Building 2102, apartment 1503. What's the purpose of your visit? I'm visiting my parents. Okay. The gate will open. Okay. Thank you. Did you find the place all right? - We got a little lost. - There was a bit of traffic. Yeah, tell me about it. You haven't unpacked. My goodness, I've been so tied up. I haven't even hung the paintings. Why bother? You'll be moving again soon anyway. This is Ji-young's bedroom. How many bedrooms are there? - Four bedrooms. - Four bedrooms... Why do you keep decorating my room? Hey, did you get a haircut? Why? You have a problem with my hair now? I'll put this here. Go ahead. What is it? Some pears and premium Korean beef. Really? You got me Korean beef? Oh, I love Korean beef. Good for her. Oh, hello. We bought fruits, too. We got some pears. You did? How was the traffic? - We got a little lost on the way. - Hand that over. I got it. - Great view, eh? - Yes, you have a great house. So how are you? You must be busy. I've got a bit of time on my hands since the application season is over. Have your students got their results yet? We have to wait but things are promising. I'm sure they'll turn out well. By the way, one of my employees has a daughter who loves to draw. Take a look. I have it here in the chat room. I thought it would be a good idea to introduce you to her. What grade is she in? Eighth or ninth grade? Is she getting lessons? Not yet. Her parents are looking for a suitable art class in Incheon. If she's planning on getting into art school, I'd recommend her to join a class in Seoul. Well, my academy offers preparatory courses. Really? Can you can arrange to meet her parents? Sure, they can consult with me. That's great. All right, then. Let's see. How do we do this? If you give me their contact, I'll give them a call. Okay. Let me see. Ten. One moment. A large crowd of citizens took to the streets of Gwanghwamun for the fifth weekend in a row to demand resignation of president Park Geun-hye. Things must be hectic at your office with all that political chaos. Yeah. I'm under a lot of pressure. There is much tension between the CG team and the reporters. It's not easy to please everyone. At least I don't work overtime. The kitchen stove is a pain in the neck. It takes forever to get something done. - Su-hyeon, you must be hungry. - No, I can wait. Just give me a few more minutes. Dinner is almost ready. Why did you move to this part of town? You wait and see. The housing market is gonna boom. I wish we could stop moving. What are you saying? Are you serious? Who do you think you owe all this to? For goodness sake, I can't believe you said that. Do you think I do this because I like moving? Besides, have any of you ever helped me move? Ji-young. It has been almost two years since you started working for that company. Are they going to renew the contract? I'll find out in about two weeks. They might offer me a permanent position. But you never know. Do you ever go on that golf course over there? Huh? No. I don't play golf. Well, it's right in front of the complex but I would've preferred to have a park. Do you have to pay to go on the course? Of course you have to pay. Did you think it was for free? All right, should we all have a drink? Oh, you don't drink, do you? - No, I don't. I have to drive anyway. - Okay, then. - I think I'll pass. - Really? Yeah, next time I'll have what you make. The fruit schnapps? Didn't I make cherry schnapps last year? Cherry? I think it was cherry. Right? Yeah. Let's begin. Bon appetit. Anyway, how long have you guys been together? About seven years. Aren't you going to get married? Have you never thought about it? What's the rush. Rush? Do you know how old she is? It's not a rush. In my days, if you hit thirty, people started calling you a spinster. Mom, let's talk about this later. Eat your dinner. This is delicious. You have to be young to look good in a wedding dress. I've never seen an old bride look good in a wedding dress. Besides, your father will be retired in two years. It'd be better... Let's talk later. Why can't we talk now? Isn't it about time we talked about this? Are you just going to waste your time? I want to do things like others do. Why don't you take it outside. Huh? Take it. Come on. They must have a plan. This isn't a good time to talk. This is dinner time. When do we ever talk? Do we ever get together? Should we talk over coffee? Do they ever have time for me? They're always busy. Mom, this is exactly why I can't come home. For crying out loud! Why do you always get so worked up? Do you know how intimidating you are? I can't talk to you. Can't talk? You're the one who's doing all the talking. Wow, I can't talk to my own daughter now? You know you're my only daughter, an only child. Why can't you be like others? I want to see you get married and have a kid like everybody else. I'd like to show off but you're not giving me anything. Why do I feel that I have to hide you? I feel so small whenever someone asks about you. Why would you feel that way? Honestly, I'm not overly proud of you. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Have you got nothing to say? Aren't you her father? You don't think this is important? So you're an innocent bystander, are you? I'm always playing the villain. Oh, this is awkward. Have I said something wrong? Ji-young. Try to understand your mother. Have you met Su-hyeon's parents? What do they do? I heard they're running a sashimi place. Where? Samcheok. On the east coast? Have you been there? No. Is mom mad? I don't know. I'll call you back. Talk later. What are you doing here? Why are you crying? Why are you crying? Are you okay? Are you stressed? Wake up. Do you want to hear something scarier? You know my brother wants me to come to Samcheok. He told me that mom thinks you're coming too. She believes you're coming. Scary, eh? Why do you cry? Why are you crying? Do you want me to cry with you? Let's go inside. They must be waiting. Are you done crying? How is your father? My father? He has mild hypertension but he's okay. What does he do? He is a security guard at a factory. In the evening, he drinks… Do you enjoy teaching? It wasn't easy in the beginning but it feels good when my students do well. It's fun. How long have you been teaching? About ten years or so. Is there a lot of money in that business? - The art education business? - Yes. Well, I guess it depends on the size of the business. But I heard the big institutes make a lot of money, almost as much as a medium sized corporate. Wow, that much? Do you think you can find out more about the business? For example, where might be a good location and so on. For an art institute? Is someone interested in starting up a business? Well, it's just an idea. From what I know, it depends on location… Are you all right? Oh, my jacket is ripped. Oh, I'm fine. - It's ripped? - Yeah, it's damaged. Well, that's that. We should go in now. It's cold. - Are you sure you're okay? - I'm fine. I know you're not sleeping. Get up, will you? Let's talk. You're coming to your grandmother's 80th birthday, aren't you? When you come, don't bring Su-hyeon. Why? You know why. Everyone will be there. I don't want to have to make up excuses. You don't approve of either of us, do you? Now you're overreacting. Mom, stop decorating my room every time you move to a new house. You picked out everything in this room. There is nothing in this room that belongs to me. Like you haven't used any of them! What, you haven't touched them? Are you implying that this isn't your home anymore? Is that it? Hey, when I took your bag earlier, I think I saw something I shouldn't have. I'm not. What if you were? I'm not. Does Su-hyeon know? No. Okay, I want to believe that he doesn't know. If he knew, he wouldn't be doing nothing. You always say you know what you're doing. What if... What if... you were pregnant, what would you do? Tell me. What's going on? Are you guys still talking? No, we're done. - Dad, I'm gonna go. - What? What are you talking about? Why don't you go later? No, we're busy. Let's go. We're leaving already? Honey, what's going on? Bye, mom. Hey, stay a little longer. No, no, no. We have to go. Really? Okay then, I'll see you soon. Drive safely. We should have a drink next time. We should. Oh, hold on. Are you really… - I can't take it. - Take it. You don't have to do this. Have a safe trip. Drive safely. We'll get going. Goodbye. What is that? Why is that on my car? What now! Shit. I'm going to need to talk to someone about this. Why is this on my car? Get in. Ji-young. Get in. You get in. I'll take it off. Get in. Ji-young, get in. I got this. - We go straight? - I don't think so. No? Should we take the exit? We stop. If we stop, we'll die. We stop, we die. Ji-young, I'm sorry. - Why do you keep apologizing? - I feel like I need to apologize. Look, we've lost signal. - Go straight. - Straight? - Oh, no. - What? The estimated arrival time just went up. What's wrong with this thing? Maybe yours doesn't work either. - It says it takes 31 minutes. - Which way should we go? Do you think we should've taken the exit before? No, there was no way out. What was the password… Turn the light on. Why self portraits? I don't know. You should know. You painted them. You've been painting self portraits since college. Well, when I look at them, it feels like someone else has painted them. A person other than myself. That's not what I'm asking. There has to be a concept. You need something that sounds more persuasive. You don't have that? You know, words. I don't know. You need that to get into graduate school. Do I need such things? Words? Absolutely. Su-hyeon, I know who you are and what you're thinking. That's why we're still friends. The work is important but words are more important. How you present it decides how much it is worth. It affects the way people look at it. It affects everything. I haven't got that. Maybe I should take a speech class. You have to have them. But there is something even more important than words. There is? Wow, this is exhausting. What's more important? When you were in college, how did you get along with Professor Choi? Professor Choi? Well, I said hello when I saw him on campus, I took some of his classes. That's about it. Is there more to it? Of course there is. Hey, he likes his drinks. That's why the kids always brought him expensive whiskies, took him out to dinners. You have no idea how hard they tried to please him. You have to do those things. Do I have to? You must. I'm telling you. Can you help me with it? How do I do it? - I'll help you out. - How? In fact, Professor Choi is having a solo exhibition in a few days. We'll go together. What would I do there? You show up, have dinner and drinks, let him know that you're interested in getting into graduate school. Do I have to go so far? Just to get into a graduate school? - You have to. - I have to? Seriously? Are you gonna do it or not? There is no other way? No. Trust me. I thought about it myself but there is other way. Just come to the exhibition and do as I tell you. I'll tell you how to smile, what to say, how to say… Everything. You just come. Most importantly, you'll have to get the check. I have to get the check? This is insane. Arrest Park Geun-hye. This is our order. The president must be impeached. Arrest the president. Let's go this way. I think that's where the candlelight protesters are. Hello. Yes. I sent everything before my leave. I did. I'm out of town at the moment. Just the picture files? Yeah. Yeah. What if… I mean supposing I am pregnant, would you want a boy or a girl? I don't care if it's a boy or a girl. You? I… Should I lay tiles for a living? What? Should I get a tilers license? There's a boom in the tile business. Are you going to stop painting? I can do both. When I make some money, should we open up a restaurant? You could open up a sashimi place. Sashimi place? Sashimi… - Are you good with the knife? - I did some filleting when I was younger. Oh, you're a filleter. But I can't kill a fish. - I can do the killing. - You can? We have a plan then. We can open up a sashimi place. - We should go to Samcheok tomorrow. - Why? - So I can practice. - What practice? My mom does everything. There won't be anything to practice on. Do you take after your mom or dad? My grandad on my mom's side. - That means you take after your mom. - I take after my mom's side. - Who do I take after? My mom or dad? - You? Your mother. I take after my mom? Yeah, you have the same kind of energy… The determination? You think I'm determined like my mom? No? What's wrong with that? You don't like it? I'm scared that I might become a mom like my mom. If there is something you don't like about yourself, you can try to change it. Still, I think it'll crack out of me from time to time. You should fight it out. Do I have to fight it? You have to fight it. Where are the cups? I've packed them all. The paper cups are out there somewhere. Do you want some? You're getting a drink? Why not? I can't drink? Fill me up. - I'll pour you a cup. - It's all right. Cheers. This is delicious. I think this is the best delivery food in town. I love their sweet and sour pork. Will we ever be eating these again? Will there be another place like this one? We should find one. I don't think there would be a place like this one. It's too bad. I'm gonna miss this. Do you think we'll ever be able to come back to this part of town? No. We won't be able to afford the rent. What about the car? Who's going to use the car? Who will be working farther away from home? I think you will. Then I'll use the car. Are you going to pay for the gas? - I'll pay and I'll drive. - Okay. Are you sure about this? You won't regret it? I'll try living without the car for a month. I might change my mind afterwards. - I think she's awake. - She's awake? Man, what took you so long? I'm sorry. - Hurry up. - I'm sorry. I have to go. - Oh man, get a move on! - Okay. You have to slow down. Here? The speed limit is 60. You're going at 65. 65? You shouldn't exceed 60. 64, 65... It doesn't matter. Are you sure? I'm the one paying all the traffic tickets. We got tickets? Remember you got caught by a traffic camera the last time? I was caught? Wasn't it you who got caught? - It was you. - It was me? Where was this? Oh, my! Oh! It wasn't like this before. I used to drop by for noodles here. There is no bathroom here. Can you hold it? Yeah, I can hold it but not for long. Let's go somewhere else. You know that my brother called me a few days ago. Shortly after I hung up, I checked the internet and there was this news of a woman whose corpse had washed up on the beach where I used to play. Her limbs were gone. It was just the torso. That was shortly after my brother had called. Isn't that creepy? Isn't that ominous? No head? No limbs? - No. - Just the torso? Are you getting goosebumps? - What happened to her? - Please drive safely. Someone must have killed her and ditched the body at night. That's Samcheok. That's the kind of place you're headed to. Turn the car around for a sec. Turn the car around? Why? Just do it. Why? You wanna go back? We can't go back now. It's too late. - What should I call them? - What? Your parents. - You said you had it all figured out. - I've got it all figured out. I just don't know what to call them. What should I call them? - Mother, father. - What? Mother, father. I've never done that. Mother, Father. Call them like I call them. Father. - Aren't you cold? - I'm freezing. Get in the car. Do you want coffee? - You don't want coffee? - I'll have coffee. Wait inside. I'll get some coffee. Do you want regular coffee? It's mom. What is she doing out here? Are you working? What do you do? I work for a broadcasting company. Which broadcasting company? It's a cable network. Are you like a journalist? No, not a journalist. I work in a news team. I coordinate ideas and arrange team operation. I couldn't understand a word you said. I don't even understand it myself. It's hard to explain. Oh dear. Look, this is all burning. - Oh, ouch! - Careful. It's getting scorched. It shouldn't be like that. It should be softer. - It's fine. You can sit down. - Yes. How about your parents? Are they both well? Yes, they are both well. - Oh no. Look. - Should I turn down the gas? Turn it down. It's getting burnt. This stove must have a very high output. You have to adjust the heat. - Oh, no. - Be careful. Oh, it's burning. Turn it off. Are you sure you've turned it down? Oh, no. Oh. I think this should take the heat away. - It's getting everywhere. - Are you okay? - Do you live by yourself? - Yes. - I assume you're not much of a cook. - Actually, I really am a good cook. I guess I'm nervous. - Are you sure you've turned the gas down? - I have. It's fried. It was meant to be grilled. I think the fish is different from what we get in Seoul. We got them filleted this morning. I'm sure they're nothing like what you have in Seoul. What about your mother? Is she a housewife? - She is in the real estate business. - Real estate? What about your father? My father works for the government. Oh, the government. - Let me do that. - We have to finish this in time. Has he retired? No, he is a few years away from retirement. How many years? About two years. Father. He is not here. Why should I go there? Cement factory? That's too far. I'm hanging up. Guess which one is me. It's the prettiest boy. The most eye-catching, bright-eyed, the sad and the beautiful kid. Isn't it obvious? Him. - No. The most… - This one? He is ugly. Or… This one. This one looks like you. Wrong. Or… It's the prettiest boy, with the biggest eyes. - I see. - What do you mean "I see"? Stop joking around. - Here. Is this you? - No, his head is too big. Can I come in? Come in. I'm coming in. - Hello. - Oh, hello. Father is here. Father, Su-hyeon. Hello, how do you do? - You came. - Yes. - It has been a while. - Yes. How are you? I can't complain. Hey, Dong-wook, where are the others? Well, this is a small family get-together. You've fixed quite a meal today. Anyhow, your future daughter-in- law is here. Did she pour you a drink? Oh, she's not our daughter-in-law. Aw, come on. She is here, she has joined the party. It's only a matter of time until they marry. Let me pour you a drink. Oh, go ahead. Okay. That's fine. - Make yourself comfortable. - Yeah, make yourself at home. So, shall we… Oh. It's okay. It's fine. Have another round. I'll have another one. Slow down on the drinks. Anyway, how is Young-bae these days? I don't see him anymore. You know the story. I haven't seen that asshole in years. How is your work at the factory? How are you hanging in there? You should consider yourself lucky. The factory business and all the construction is ravaging the whole town. Who would want to come to a dusty industrial town? Who would want to come and spend money here? Hey, you think I like working for the factory? Mr. Park, how do you like the food? Aw, everything is delicious. The chop suey is good. It's all good. You must be starving. Have as much as you want. I ate before I came. Hey brother, to be honest, I couldn't easily make up my mind to come here tonight. But here I am and I want to wish you a happy birthday, brother. Happy birthday, father. Hey, Su-hyeon. It's been a long time since you last saw your father. Yes. Let me fill you up. Yes. Try the chop suey. Earlier on, you seemed to be quite enjoying your drink. It's no fun drinking with Su-heyon, is it? No. At least, it's fortunate that he doesn't like drinking. I don't like drinking either, but I've gotten into a habit of sipping a glass or two. Let me offer you a piece. This is the tasty part. Thank you. Everyday, when I sit down with myself and think about marriage, it's nothing more than having to put up with one person as long as decades. Sleeping with him, waking up with him, eating with him, sleep, wake up, eat… Even if you love the person it gets tiresome. Imagine what it's like to do that with a person you can't get along with. It's a living hell. Hell is closer than you might think. I'm talking too much, aren't I? I have two sons. I've no daughter. By the way, have your folks met Su-hyeon? Yes. I see. They're not too impressed with him, are they? I know he doesn't have much that he can offer. They like him. They're really fond of him. Oh, how nice of them. Maybe it's not my place to say this, but try living together before you make a decision. If you still feel okay about doing that for the rest of your life, then do it. It won't be late by then. Oh, I hope you won't get me wrong. I would have said the same thing to my own daughter. What if you've lived together but you're still not sure? Mom! Mom! Mom! Yes! What are you doing down there? Come, hurry up. Okay, Oh dear, they must be getting drunk. Let's go. Father, see this cake. Your future daughter-in- law bought this cake. Oh, really? Thank you, dear. I haven't had such a feast in a long time. So much good food! Everything is delicious and the soju goes down like honey. Thank you, Dong-wook. Thank you. And you, thank you. Yeah. Hey! Su-hyeon, thank you. You have no idea how happy I am that you came all the way from Seoul to see your father. Have a drink, you scoundrel! And there, my future daughter-in-law… Her name is Ji-young. Ji-young. That's right! Ji-young, thank you! Let's toast! Let's toast! Have a drink! Just one drink. Dude, aren't you going to answer your father? Hey, Su-hyeon. How old are you this year? - He was born on the year of the ox. - Let me see. Ox… How old is he then? Thirty-two. Thirty-two? You're thirty-two. Shouldn't you be married by now? Are you just gonna waste your time? Huh? Su-hyeon, don't you dare wander off. You'll marry her. Is it Ji-young? Marry her! Get married, save up some money. That's how you become a real man. And you should have kids. Have a family. Why is everyone so quiet? Hey, are you listening? Mom, you should say something. I wish you health. You shouldn't skip meals. I know I screwed up. Hey, listen. Let's stop all this and start over, huh? Mom, should we start tidying up? It's getting late. You should take him home. Mom. What the fuck! Hey, I'm talking to you. You cunt! Get your hands off me, you crook! You son of a bitch! What did I do to deserve this shit! What! Hey, Kim Su-hyeon! Do you think you're so much better than me? Let go, you bastard! What have I ever done. How far are you gonna go? Let's go back. Let's go back. Go back where? - Come on. Let's go. - To do what? Something. Anything. Do you think there is anything you can do? No, that's why you should do something. I'm not going in. Come on. What do you want me to do? We can't just walk out on them. We have go back! What do you think there is to do? And would you stop trying so hard to be polite! You want me to stop being polite? Let's just stay out here for a while. What do you think I'm doing this for? If you want to go back, you go back. I'm staying here. Don't just stand there. What is it with you? If you want to go, go. Never mind. I'm leaving. What? Why should I? It's cold. Are you okay? No. Why did you bring me to Samcheok? I don't know. - You don't know? - I don't know why. Were you scared? I'm sorry. Did you do the self test? You're asking this now? Now? Are you done? Where are you going? It's cold. I'm really scared! How do you eat that thing? Is that rain or snow? Wait. - No. - Take it. Su-hyeon, your mother is offering me money. Take it. Take it. Drive safely. Get in the car. Quick. Off you go. - Goodbye. - Bye. - I'm off! - Drive safe. Close the window. - Bye, mom. - Off you go. Close the window. The road is closed. - We can't go through? - No. - Can't we take a right turn? - We should have done that earlier. I'm having the last piece. Let's move. Thank you. It was delicious. - I'll make it three bucks. - Two of those for three bucks? Three bucks? For two of them? - Are you a couple? - Yes. - He's handsome. - Isn't he? Have a good night. - Are you teasing me? - What? Will you stop teasing? She wasn't even looking at you. Why is everyone going that way? I know. Should we go the other way? What's going on? Why is everyone going that way? Let's turn back. Now everyone seems to be coming this way. No? Doesn't it feel that way? Do you see that? We go this way and everyone goes the other way. Should we go that way? Let's go that way.
