No, Ralph. Bad. Bad. Stop it now, Ralph. Please. You need some help? What do they want? Dirty old men. Late as usual. Four tomorrow. I'll be there. I'm gonna miss you til then. Good evening, sir. You can take the car in, Jimmy. Right away, sir. Hello, darling. This morning I spoke to Haldeman on the phone. He's very disturbed about the market being shaky. Isn't that a new suit? You like it? Hong Kong tailors are tremendous. Yes, they really must be. When are we going to Hong Kong? If Haldeman can make it, he'll be here next week. He mentioned he would be expecting us for dinner. Oh no. Here we go again for another great time with that phony secretary he brings along. With the brains she's got, let's hope she's good in bed. You'd join her as soon as you could, wouldn't you my love? How amusing. Love-making's your mania. It's all your fault because you're so good at it. As far as she's concerned, I wouldn't go for her. She's nothing but a stupid little tramp. You look tired. You drink too much. You should be on milkshakes. Why not saltpeter while you're at it? That would please you. Since your love making is such perfection, why is it that we don't do it more often? You're getting to be a bore. About performing, how would you like a little surprise package? "I'm warning you that your husband is screwing around "like a sex-starved wolf." Starved? What a mean expression. "He organizes sex parties with groupies and weird friends "in your villa by the lake. "Signed, a friend." You believe all that nonsense? What kills me is the persistent bad taste you show in this mass. Seems to me, my dear, that with all the money I give you, you should play in higher class instead of running around with whores. Such a nice material. You have a short memory, darling. The immense sums of money I supposedly throw away on orgies you'd like to be at and on clothes that you find sexy are not gift because it's my own pay for running your firm. My firm would like to see you less in my villa and more in the office. There goes that sharp memory again. Sharing the profits of your firm. Eventually I could afford to pay for a studio of my own and I wouldn't use your damn villa anymore. Right, my sweet? I'm not as naive as you think, my wild bird. I'm all for not closing the door to your cage, but to make sure you come back, I keep the combination of the safe. In bed, especially. Okay, I'm all for it. Me too. I could give up working and then maybe you'd feel happier. You do have a tricky mind, but then who would pay for your advances? Girls, cars, champagne, all cost money. And where would you get it if you quit? Playing the old divorce game wouldn't help you either. Oh, but I have no intention of divorcing you. I have big plans. You'd be surprised of what I've thought up for you, yes. What're you shooting at? Are you imagining you're shooting at your wife? Come on, I have something to tell you. All right, darling, so what's the matter? Something you should know about. Elizabeth showed me an anonymous letter she received telling her very frankly what we've been doing. So I guess she wants to get a divorce. Don't be ridiculous. She's too much in love with me. She's never had any allusions about my fidelity. But she was very clear about the fact I'd never get my freedom, regardless of whatever happens in the future. I have a perfect idea. Let's go on a trip together. Anywhere, the Bahamas or any place where you could ask for a divorce. It'll never work. She'll tell my lawyer she loves me, that I'm behaving stupidly and that I'll be back soon. You'll never leave here, you're too scared. If I had money I would've left her a long time ago. Unfortunately, if I left her now, I wouldn't have enough to pay for a weekend in Deauville. But I'll be happy just with you. You're only using money as an excuse because you're a coward. Makes me think some times that you don't want me anymore. Let me prove that you're wrong. Oh don't, I'm not in the mood to make love. Leave me alone. You're not a man. You're only playing with me and obeying your wife. Wasting my time. We'll see about that. Please. Wasting your time? Just my luck too. To think I missed a part to play in a film. I could've been flying to Rome today. For you I've messed up my career. Don't kid yourself. What would you do without me? I'd be a star. Yeah, a big star, sure, walking the streets of Rome. How do you know that? All I know is that you have a gorgeous body and you know how to use it. Ow! In bed before dark. Down right immoral. Shut up, jealous. You're the peeping tom. You told me that a woman in love is just like a black widow spider who eats up her mate. Well, wasn't it cleaver of me to say that. Yes, but you also said something else. That you'd prefer to put a bullet in your head rather than sleep with you wife. She really must've made me mad that day. The sight of blood makes me feel sick. I wouldn't object to shooting someone. That's a happy thought. As long as it's not me you shoot. Couldn't happen. I need you too much. That's fine, now prove it. Don't frighten me, Burckhardt. 18 percent increase is a lot. If I were you I'd look into this with my husband. As controller of your company, I thought it important to take this matter up with you personally. It appears to me that you're not exactly happy with my husband's way of working. My dear Mrs. Schroeder, I don't want to mix myself in your personal affairs, but business... Hello, Burckhardt. If you two are having a private conference, I don't want to interrupt. I was just telling Mr. Burkhardt that such a big increase on expenses is your responsibility. Another cup, please. It would perhaps be preferable for me to leave. Talk about leaving, allow me to inform you that I am quitting the firm. What? Yep. I've been offered a good proposition. I'll be signing my contract very soon. Well, good news for you. Here it is. What? I said here it is. Yes, surprise, Mr. Burckhardt, gives life a certain zest. Yes, it surly does ma'am. You know the way. Now what does this mean? So you want to leave me, darling? What do you know about that? Aren't you being irrational? Nobody can have everything the way they want it, remember that. You knew all along. What's the big idea? I'm not as stupid as you may think. I'm not letting the competition grab you away. Well, I'm sorry but there's not much you can do about it. That's where you're wrong. It so happens that your new employers wouldn't jeopardize their contract with me, which can happen if I were deprived of certain important and personal services that I'm depending on you for. Do they know I'm indispensable in bed? I don't mind their knowing it. Some of them already know what does on in my bed. Many of them, I'm sure. That's right, nothing in the world can stop me. I always get whatever I'm after. I have influential friends and I know how to use them. No one will hire you. You shouldn't forget we're married for better or for worse. And you belong to me now. As you will until death. Dreadful situation, isn't it? Oh, don't worry about it. I think I can face it, darling. "You belong to me now and you will until death." Do you think she meant your death? What are we gonna do about it? I think she's planning to kill you. Let her plan it. I'll her before she gets me. Do you really mean that, darling? There's no other way. Couldn't we just go away? Far enough so no one will ever find us. Sooner or later she'd find me, Gina. It's amazing, darling. The resemblance is perfect. Turn your head a bit. Sensational. Have you got the powder? It's in my purse, darling. This works very fast. She'll be asleep in three minutes. Let's go back over it. When Elizabeth comes, be sure you're upstairs. It must appear to be an empty house. What if she doesn't come at all? Don't worry, she'll come. Just to get proof against me. The first thing she'll be doing, as I know her, is to have a glass of scotch. Her favorite brand is always in this decanter. As soon as she's asleep, you rush down here and carry her out there, to that sofa. Then you go back upstairs, taking her bag and coat. Don't forget to bring along her glass and the decanter as well. Then I will arrive with the two girls. I will start the record player going. Then you come down. Don't be afraid. It's not loaded yet. Yes, but if she's missed her gun in the meantime, what then? Don't worry. All you have to think about is the part you play. Hysterical. "You're a monster! I won't go on! "I prefer to kill myself." You're a monster. I won't go on. I prefer to kill myself. No, give it more feeling. More conviction. You're a monster. I won't go on. I prefer to kill myself. That was very good. Now then you wait until I take the girls out to the car. And you know what to do about Elizabeth. Let's go through it once more to be absolutely sure. You wait til I take the girls out to the car. You know what to do about Elizabeth. Elizabeth. Don't you think our roles are out of balance? Why? As I see it, you have all the fun and the dirty work's mine. There's nothing to worry about, Darling. You have to trust me. Hello? Who is it? A friend who wants to help you. What do you want to help me about? What friend? I've already proven once that I'm your friend. Oh, you're the one who warned me the other day by letter. You understand that if you must remain anonymous, I've every reason to view your warning skeptically. My name is not important. But you're wrong to be skeptical. If you want proof, all you have to do is go and see for yourself. You husband and these girls are having a splendid time in your villa. I hope I've made it clear. Hi, beautiful. Cut the light. Hold it! Hurry right away. 30 Lake Road. Hello? Hello? Now you've done it. She's dead, you murdered her. I just gave her a tap. Hello? What number? Hello? Hang up, stupid. Hello? The police heard everything. Look at that. Anyway, don't forget that you're the one that hit her, not me. Oh, shut up. What're we going to do with her? The best thing to do would be to throw her in the lake. Or do you wanna keep her as a souvenir? Somebody's coming. That ride was fun but now we'll give you a real good one. I didn't know you lived in a palace. What a layout! Go right in, girls. You can find In a flower Lovely in the sun Where's the bridal suit? Up in the first floor? Let's go find it. No, wait! Don't go up there! Of you want a bite, I'll give you something to eat. Oh flowers Be not to say goodbye To the florist And the color of the dream of youth Oh flowers of love Hey flowers You can find Hey flowers In a flower The loveliness of being In a flower Oh flowers Be not a say goodbye Elizabeth! You could've told us she was gonna join the party. What're you doing here? I had to prove to myself how disgusting it is to be married to you. Get those whores our of here immediately! You don't have to make a scene. You'll get your lover back. Now please, just wait for me. I'll take them back. That's all you've got to say? Elizabeth. It's not what you think. Oh shut up. You're a monster. I prefer to kill myself. I can't go on. Get them out of here! Go out, you hear? Go on! Go! We're already going. Hold it! Stay where you are! Get back in there! Let me go! Let me go! I didn't do anything! What the hell's going on here? I've got my rights. Let me go, you're hurting me. Sorry to break up the party, but who called the police? I did. Why? I had a little run-in of no important with my wife but she suddenly got all upset. What a bore. Another night wasted. Anyway, what'd you call us for? Can I go now? We've got a lot of crazy calls, but this one's too much. I've got to warn you, this little caper will cost you a lot. How could you do this to me? You should be ashamed of yourself. Don't do anything until the police have gone. Hurry up girls. Get in the car. You sure pick funny times to invite to your private orgy. Next time around, tell grandma to stay in here room. Too late to get anything else tonight. Anyway, we won't be back here soon. We'd be swinging in town if you had listen to me. Where are my keys? You blind? They're right there. And the police on top of it. What a night. Out you go. Nice guy. A real prince. It must be Mother's Day. What're you gonna do, take her flowers? You beast! Leaving two poor girls out here in the middle of the night. We'll get you, you brute! What a rat! Let him go. Sure, let him go. How we gonna get back to town? What's the matter now? Don't tell me you've lost your nerve. She's disappeared. What're you talking about? She wasn't there anymore when I came back to do it. It's incredible. Somebody must've... Burglars. Elizabeth must've seen them. You were upstairs and you didn't even hear them? But I'm positive she was here when you came in. You must believe me. Nevermind that. We have to find out where she is now. Look. The boat isn't there. It was docked right here. Ralph, what's this? It's Elizabeth's. I'm sure it must've happened like this. Elizabeth had begun to call the police but the burglars heard the conversation. They knocked her out but panicked, dumped her body in the lake and then disappeared. But then we have nothing to worry about. Elizabeth's dead and it won't be blamed on us. Don't be stupid, Gina. I was with you when the police came and I will get involved because you were Elizabeth. But the robbery could've happened later. Now you're mad. It couldn't have been later because it only took me a minute or so with the girls before I came back and they can prove all that. How in blazes would anybody believe me? When they testify about this, I'm sure the least they could get would be a life sentence. There must be another way out. It's not my fault, I swear I didn't hear anything. You believe me, don't you? Yes, I know you did the best you could. It's me again. Excuse me for breaking in like this. It so happens I forgot something in the rush. My favorite compact. Don't bother, I know the way. Now we can't say that you're dead anymore. There's only one solution left. You must go on playing your role. But how? Nothing's happened at all. Elizabeth is alive. No, I couldn't. Of course you can, believe me, I'll figure it all out. You'll be coming back with me now as my wife. You're out of your mind. Tomorrow I'll tell Burckhardt that you've had a nervous breakdown and you can't see anybody. That way I'm buying time to put together enough money to leave the country. I could never do it. It's too much for me. Gina. I trust you. You'll be just perfect. I'm sure. Our future depends on you. Good evening, sir. Good evening, you can take the car in. Good evening, ma'am. Quick, into the bedroom. Where is it? It's in front of you. Good evening, madame, is there anything you need? Madame is not feeling very well. Would you bring us some fruit? Right away, sir. All right, calm down. I've decided to go to Saint-Tropez. I want you to leave with Jimmy tomorrow to open the villa. Are you sure you won't need us here, sir? No, we'll be all right. We'll be leaving after tomorrow. Very well. Goodnight, sir. All right, that's one thing taken care of. Tomorrow we'll be alone. It's impossible, I'm too scared. I almost fainted a minute ago. I'm gonna get you a tranquilizer. Something to help you sleep til tomorrow morning. Is it the same one you gave Elizabeth? Sorry dear, that we both gave Elizabeth. Are you gonna ask me also to wear her nightgown and use her toothbrush? And her makeup?! Careful with the wig. You're gonna need it. I'm going into the garden. Are you crazy? Look at yourself. I forbid you to go out like that. We'd be in trouble if anyone saw you. Sorry, I thought you said by this morning we'd be alone. Yes, but you're forgetting the neighbors. You know you're supposed to be sick in bed. Lovesick, maybe? Don't be silly. You had a nervous breakdown and you're suffering from hallucinations. You're desperate because I'm unfaithful and you want to kill yourself, remember. Meanwhile, if you're hungry, your breakfast is ready in the kitchen. And where is the kitchen? Last door on your left. I'll be back in two or three hours. Don't open the door to anybody. And if the phone rings, don't answer it. Good morning, Mr. Schroeder. Good morning, Max. Yes? A lady here to see you, sir. What's her name? She said to tell you she was Mimsy. That you'd know her. All right, send her right in. Hello, sweetheart. Don't look so sad. Aren't you happy I'm here to see you? I'm always glad to see you. You look younger than ever. Ha. No, it's true. Believe me. Don't give me that. You got any other jokes? Don't try bluffing me as you always did before. How'd you track me down here? My two little nieces were invited last night to a soiree that didn't come off. What? I know the whole story. What a washout you've become. So life is a little dull with a wife like yours. Still, I think you went too far this time. Yeah, she's completely hysterical. I'm so frustrated I thought about suicide. Pass me your crying towel. What a pity you're still playing the same old tune. You might have learned a lot of things about life if you'd stayed with Mimsy. Remember, I was never jealous. I know. What a rat you were. Every time you'd go on one of your escapades, I'd close my eyes but I'd leave the money on the table. You were fabulous. How many nights did I cry, expecting you for hours. Yes, I know. It's useless to talk about it. You can be wonderful when you want to be. But it takes a little to know how to handle you and adapt to your screwing around. What did you used to say? My sabbatical leave. Your sabbatical leave. But nothing matters as long as you came back. You always liked nightclubs, lots of girls and fancy sports cars and that's the way it was. You're a good psychoanalyst. And you're a great love maker, but you know how to make a woman suffer too. All right, that's enough now. I'm sorry. You're the type of person to hold on to. I'm sorry I didn't. You know why I came to see you now? I guess to talk about our good old days. Ah huh, sure. And well, you know what I mean. I think I do. The cost of living is very high. And your old friend's in real trouble. I'm just an ordinary employee around here. Please, you can stop your crying act. I'm sick of it. All right then, how much? Five thousand might help. You know, these girls are always short of money in their chatterboxes. Their silence would, of course, be most convenient, no doubt about that. I mean, it's better the less said about this situation. I'll try and find the money. Excuse me for not going out with you. Watch out for the steps, they've just been waxed. Be careful not to break your neck. And if she did it would cost me double. Yes? Mr. Burckhardt's here for you. Send him right in. Yes, I want you to have a good rest. Oh, Burckhardt's just arrived. Perhaps you want to speak to him, dear. Just as you wish, Elizabeth. He'll understand, I'm sure. I'll be back early, my love. Excuse me, please. I hope it's nothing serious. I'm very worried. Her regular doctor hasn't even been able to give us a helpful diagnosis of the trouble yet. If we must get a psychiatrist-- What symptoms have you been able to observe til now? She has an extreme mental depression with headaches and hallucinations. It's awfully painful. Wouldn't it have something to do with your idea of quitting the firm because she didn't like that? Anyway, it's time she had a change of scenery. Would would probably do her good to have some sea air and I'm planning a trip with her. My wife asked me just now if you would be kind enough to make 200 thousand marks to her personal account. You say 200 thousand marks? You'd need the approval of the chief accountant to pay such a large amount. I've got to be smart as a fox. Burckhardt's no fool. I must move extremely cautiously. I suppose that means we have to wait. Not long. A little more patience and then we'll be rich. We'll try to find the right place where you can be just beautiful and happy and where my business ability can be, at last, appreciated. What do you think of Acapulco? You must go on playing the role of Elizabeth. I'm going away with my wife after all and with the 200 thousand marks her devoted Burckhardt will supply to help save his boss' marriage. Let's hope that adorable wife of yours will never reappear. She won't. Thanks to you, she rests in peace. Under the circumstances, your sense of humor-- Oh, forget who you are and it'll all go fine. Gina must disappear completely. You're waiting here for your beloved husband and you're suffering from a nervous breakdown. A few weeks from now you will be Gina again and we'll celebrate your resurrection. And what if, in the meantime, they discover her body? What kind of explanation will you give them? Let's leave now, it's absurd to run the risk. Stay well hidden until we do. I don't want to be around here the day the police come to arrest me. Do as I say and nothing will happen to you. Think about our future. Hello? Who? The police? What's happened to the house? Oh, I see. How do you know? Oh, the house keeper. Yes, I see. Yes, I will. Half an hour, I'll be there. Right. What're they calling for? The robbery at the villa. The woman tried to call here on the phone, as nobody was answering, she went to the police. I have to go for an inventory. No, don't go please. I'm sure it's a trap. You'll be arrested. Let's leave now. No, what about the money? You're not thinking, are you? Ralph, I'm sure they found the body. Hello, Mr. Schroeder. Where on Earth is your wife? Is she on a trip? No, she's been in bed completely run down. All of us suffer a lot from the heat. Oh well, tell her I'm here. If she needs anything. So, Mr. Schroeder, aside from the the silver boxes and candelabras, you're not missing anything. I already told you, Inspector, that my wife and I rarely come here. It's lucky for me they don't come here often. Because with the picking up, I can tell you it's a terrible job for me. My wife doesn't care for this house, you see, and I have no sense of order. So we rely completely on our dear Mrs. Halpert. When I come here I leave the house in such a mess that I never remember where things are. And even where I put them. That's the way I am. But there's something missing that you've must've noticed and you should've told us about. What was that? The boat. It's been found across the lake. Registration number S-1-7-3. That is yours, isn't it? Yes. We found spots of blood. Would you happen to know how they got there? No, I don't. Could be that the burglars got hurt breaking in. Perhaps an explanation, but isn't it funny there's no blood any place else? Well, we'll talk about it later. Gina? Gina? I'm in the shower! They've found Elizabeth's body. I knew it was gonna happen. We have to be out of here in 10 minutes. Do we have to move that fast? Hello, I'm listening. What? Oh, Vanetti. My wife, why? Oh, it's impossible to speak to my wife because she's sick. It's important? Come right away, then. I'll be expecting you. Goodbye. Vanetti the jeweler? He can't come here. Said he had something to speak to me about. Very urgently. Why do you risk something like that? Don't mess up everything. Go on, get dressed! You're hurting me! What does that man want? Hello, Mr. Vanetti. I won't keep you long. Unfortunately my wife isn't able to see you. You most certainly recognize this ring. You were there when Mr. Schroeder brought it. Yes, I was. Yes, it was one of her rings. Was? Why do you say was? I'm positive Mrs. Schroeder wouldn't have given up a valuable piece of jewelry like that. No, no. Well then she might have forgotten it somewhere. Yes, she could've left it anyplace. In the lady's room of a restaurant or in a movie, anywhere. It's possible. But I'd be more inclined to believe she lost it while swimming in the lake. The man who tried to sell it to me was a fisherman. That's pretty good fishing to hook a thing like that. We'll see that the man gets a good reward. Oh, but shouldn't the police be advised about it, at least? No, why should the police be concerned? Well because one never knows what might have happened. There could have been some sort of robbery or trouble at the villa. My wife will certainly be very grateful for what you've done. It's terribly kind of you. If she weren't sick in bed, as I've told you, I'm sure she'd have liked to tell you in person her feelings. As soon as she's better she will. Oh, it's really nothing. After all, your wife is a good client. May I ask your permission to make a phone call? Yes, please do. I have to tell my people I'll be late. Miss Schwartz, I'm going to be a little late. I've been tied up with Mr. Schroeder. Would you tell my client to excuse me? I'll only be able to come in half an hour. Thank you, Mr. Schroeder. I'm the one to thank you. Give my missed regards to Mrs. Schroeder. Yes sir. And tell her I hope she'll soon be all right. Yes, I will. What did he want? Nothing important. He came about a ring he wanted to give back to Elizabeth. This ring business sounds a bit strange. Don't you think so? Why must you worry about nothing? You seem upset too, I can see it. Don't take me-- I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Schroeder. I forgot my attach? case. I meant to knock but I found the key in the door. You shouldn't be so careless, you know. Now a days there's so many criminals about. And please forgive me for disturbing you. What's he gonna think now? I don't give a damn. Go get ready. 3-8-7-0-2. His coming here means they haven't identified the body. Let's find out. But you said you were there when they took her out of the lake. Yes, I know, but it doesn't mean they've identified her yet. Yes? Hello? This ring was certainly taken to Vanetti's by the same people who broke into the villa. Yes, of course. They obviously took it while they were moving Elizabeth out. Just before dumping her body. And they pretended to have found it. Yes. That's exactly how it happened. Well from now on this ring is yours. Ralph. I'm scared. You've nothing to worry about. And you mustn't be scared. Evening paper, please. Gina? Gina? What is it? Read this. "Impossible to identify body of woman found in the lake." Well that settles everything. Don't be so naive. They may identify her later, after the police investigation. I wouldn't worry about that. Do you know what happens after a few days in the water? The body gets fat just like a balloon and then it blows up. You shouldn't be drinking like that or I'm the one who's gonna blow up. You better go to bed. Don't be silly. I'm not sleepy at all. Unless you come along too, I won't go. Please, Ralph, don't leave me alone again tonight. Stop it. Stop it, I said. Come on, you're beginning to behave exactly like Elizabeth. Aren't I Elizabeth? Yes, but why make yourself into an alcoholic? You better have a milkshake. Do you mean to say that the specialist couldn't make a precise diagnosis of her condition? It's imperative for her to be given an E.E.G. The supply of blood to the left side of the brain has been much too far below the norm. Didn't you tell me the other day you were planning to take her to a famous brain specialist in Paris? Yes, that's why we'll be leaving immediately. We must explore every possibility. I'm not indispensable here as long as you take things in hand. Mrs. Schroeder knows she may rely on me for everything. Of course and she's most grateful to you. Now about the 200 thousand marks. Have you been able to do something? Well the chief accountant made some objection when I asked for the transfer. So I assume it'll take a little time. Objection? Why? It seems that the company's bylaws specifically, in paragraph number 19, demand the approval of the executive committee before making so big a transaction. This means convening a meeting of all the directors. Well that's just great. You mean my wife has no power to move her money as she pleases? How ridiculous. I think I might come up with a solution that will work. Since your wife owns more than half the shares, I can circumvent some legal requirements and call a board meeting in 24 hours. Then do it. Good, I'll also advice the chief accountant and bring them all together tomorrow afternoon. Would you be kind enough to tell Mrs. Schroeder about it? But there's no question of her coming in her condition. I promise you, it won't take more than 10 minutes and we can even hold the meeting at your house. Please just tell me what time your wife would find the most convenient. Gina? Gina, where are you? Gina? Out here. Gin... Elizabeth. What's the matter? What's the idea? You wanna ruin everything for us? You're getting out and you're getting back in the house. What do you have for a head anyway? You're supposed to be sick in bed. I told you not to go outside. Get back and get back fast. Yes, but... What's the matter with you? I've told you, I wouldn't be treated the same way you treated your wife! I've just left Burckhardt and I've told him how sick you are. Can't you see? We're right at the point of getting the money. I'm fed up with playing this part. And I'm fed up with your stupidity! You brute! Get this through your thick head! Tomorrow Burckhardt is coming over here with the power of attorney for you to sign for the transfer. Are you kidding? And I'm going to-- Yes, you are gonna sign those papers, Gina. You're crazy. Burckhardt will be impossible to fool. I won't be able to do it. He's been much to close to her. He won't suspect a thing. You'll be in bed and you'll have the curtains around you. He knows her voice. What am I supposed to do, not answer if anyone asks me a question? Do you believe I'd force you to do all this if there were a possibility of anything going wrong? All you have to do is learn how to copy her signature perfectly. And we sit back and just count the millions. You play big stakes, Ralph. Suddenly you're acting very strangely. I mean it, it's true. You're hiding something from me. Yes, it's true. I better explain everything to you now. Burckhardt's convinced your soft of, nervous breakdown wasn't enough. I had to say you're mad. I had to. Now you know the whole truth. So I'm mad? You're still not telling the whole truth. What do you mean? I don't understand. If you can't be more honest with me, I don't see why I should explain anything. Can't you leave me alone? Come on, darling, you're just nervous. It's almost over now. We'll be out of all of this in 24 hours. It's not true, no inspector. I swear we have nothing to do with that. You've been through our records. Little house break-ins and misdemeanors but that's all. And 6 months in prison for armed robbery. You forgot about that one. We broke in through the window and left the place the same way. What about the blood? It's apparently the same group as the blood found on the boat later on. And I remind you, you've admitted to assaulting a woman in this house. Not assault, we just taped her a little. Yeah. The last client you taped a little spent a year in the hospital. You might like to elaborate. All right, we hit her, but we wouldn't have done it if she hadn't been trying to get the police on the phone. Nothing intentional, believe me inspector. Oh, so it's because she was calling the police that the poor woman was assaulted. Not assault, attack. And the telephone was on this table at that time? That's right. Perhaps you can describe the woman. Her age, color of hair, what she was wearing. It looks like more than a depression. She's getting awfully neurotic. I think we should put her in a hospital right away. That wouldn't be possible, doctor. I really must insist that you come and see her and soon. She's already attempted suicide several times. I'm doing everything I can, but I just can't reason with her. I understand. Unfortunately, I have patients all day. But I'll try to come by this evening. Anytime that's connivent. If you could pretend to be a friend, it would make things simpler. Thanks very much, doctor. I'll be expecting you. Ralph? What's the matter? Congratulations. You've done a beautiful job. The perfect wife wins out. Very well played, but haven't you overlooked a little detail? What's this all about? But can't you tell me who you are? Congratulations. You've done a beautiful job. The perfect wife wins out. Very well played. But haven't you overlooked one little detail? Think about it. But I haven't done anything. What is it you want? Money? What are you calling me for? Please speak up. Tell me what you want. I know everything. Absolutely everything. If want proof, go out to the swimming pool. Someone's waiting for you there. If want proof, go out to the swimming pool. Someone's waiting for you there. It's in your interest to believe me. Don't be scared, ma'am, it's only us. We've come to empty the pool. Fred, come out of there. Okay, I'm finished. Everything's in order. I didn't know. You must know we were following your instructions. Sure, we come at the end of every month. If you'd like us to come more often, we'd be delighted. Just let us know. Bye. We oughta service that one regularly. I think it's already pretty well taken care of. What the hell are you doing now? I'm going away! I won't take it anymore! Let me go, please! Let me go, now! Let me go! Let go of me! No, I'm not going back in there! Are you crazy?! Let go of me! Shut up, you fool! You'll go to jail if you keep this up! Let me go! I wanna get out of here! Take it easy. Calm down. Read. "Ralph must produce a corpse to put his hands "on your money. "Signed, a friend." And that's what got you worked up? I'm beginning to understand the person who wrote this knows I'm gonna be killed. You're only forgetting one thing. It's not for you but for Elizabeth. I don't care, it's all over. I refused to see Burckhardt. It's a stupid idea. Not if you're as good an actress as you claim to be. You dream of being a star. Here's a beautiful opportunity to show your talents. The only way you can make it now is over your wife's dead body. Sure and then I go to jail. You don't understand, I mean my dead body, of course. I'm Elizabeth. You've been really cleaver. They all think I'm completely mad. You'll say that after one of our scraps, your wife went out and disappeared. And it's me they'll discover somewhere. You don't think your corpse would fool too many people? She was over 40. You're out of your mind. I know I am, you said it to everyone. And it's part of your beautiful plan. You'll wait to declare I've disappeared so that nobody could possibly identify the corpse and explain you thought I would come back as I did each time we'd been quarreling. I'm not as stupid as you may think. And you are not so bright. I only know one thing and that is it's impossible for me to imagine life without you. I'm in love with you, you fool. Darling, don't try to play a big scene. I don't believe a word of it. What're you getting at? You'll manage all alone because I'm leaving you. Go if you want. When you find yourself in jail, you'll be sorry you did. Stay in here. Excuse us for bothering you. Police Inspector Schultz. May we come in? By all means, please. We tried to phone but there was no answer. I just got in. May I offer you something? No thanks. Not while we're on duty. Charming little thing. We came here to talk to you about the blood on the sofa and the boat. We've discovered where it comes from. Ah. Have you? I think you've met Sargent Myer. Yes, of course. We met in the most embarrassing circumstances. I hope you'll be discreet about it, sergeant. And I personally hope you'll help us put together some bits and pieces. Your wife is here, I suppose. Well, yes, but I'm afraid she's sick in bed and won't be able to see you. Sorry. Would she by any chance be suffering from a head wound? No, but why do you ask? That's precisely one of the details we wanted to discuss with you. The burglars admitted to assaulting a woman in your villa the other night. So you've arrested them? How come you didn't know about it? I'm surprised because I thought that headquarters had advised you. Yes, we've got them and they admitted having assaulting a woman, as I've just told you. They say because they heard her phoning the police. From the description they gave, it's the same person Sergeant Myer saw with you in your villa the other night. Wearing a fur coat, reddish blonde-- Sergeant, I know my wife, thank you. Seems a bit strange that your wife didn't make a complaint immediately. Well, she often has strange ideas. Did you know about the robbery when Sergeant Myer arrived? No, you're the one who told me. It would be very interesting to know why your wife didn't tell him. You must asker. On another time, when she's better. As I said, she's sick in bed and nobody's allowed to see her. We could ask the doctor's permission and talk about it. Do you remember his phone number? Ralph! You better go see what she wants. What is it, Elizabeth? Darling, what's the matter? My medicine, please. Right away, darling. There you are. The inspector is here to see you. He has a few questions about the robbery. I've nothing to say. I want to forget about that awful evening. Well, that's all I can do for you. Excuse us for disturbing you. You were just great. You played it like a star. It was really fast thinking. Slowed them down a little too. It's all right. I'm not expecting thanks. I'm not impatient to go to jail either, you know. We must celebrate. You still wanna go? I can just get the last plane to Z?rich if I hurry. And what about me? Don't you wanna take me along? You mean you'd drop the whole idea and go with me now? To the Bahamas. Sail on. You chose the place. And the millions? You'd give up all that? We can get along on what she has in her Z?rich bank account. I'll tell Burckhardt you're feeling worse and that he should call off the meeting. I have to get a few clothes at my place and jewelry. You have enough jewelry here. Look up checkup times on the airline schedule. It's on my desk over there. Leaving from Stuttgart. Stuttgart? Why not from here? Why? Because it would be dangerous if someone saw us together. There's a flight at 9:15. Good, we have time then. You start packing and don't take too many clothes. I better go take care of the car. Don't forget the ring. I must wear it? Of course, darling. She never used to travel without it. You mustn't be out of character. Have you got her passport? I've even got two passports. Elizabeth's and mine. Don't forget to give hers to customs. And take this. Why the bag? Must I wear her initials too? If the customs officer is suspicious about the photo, the monogram should clear any doubt. You're pretty sharp, aren't you? Let's drink to Elizabeth and her complete disappearance to our life in the future and to our happiness. Listen. What is it? Oh nothing. Here's to everything. And the success of your plan, my dearest. I'm so sleepy. I'm just incapable of keeping my eyes focused. Maybe it's better if I drive while you rest. Drive carefully. Don't get us all killed. Ralph, is that gas I smell? Hmm? Oh, same as usual. The left lane. Now left again. The bypass is in front of us. No this road is 8 kilometers shorter. Ralph, that cigar of yours is making me sick. Please put it out, will you? You're right, I smell gas now. Go up, stop there. Huh? God, I feel awful. No! No! No! Sergeant, tell me about the corpse. Have you been able to identify it? The body's completely burnt. It must've been the owner of the car. No, Inspector, I don't know where she is. I see. Has something happened? Yes. Your wife had a terrible car accident and I'm sorry to have to tell you. She didn't survive. I was afraid of something like this. What did you say? I say I'm not surprised. Do you mind explaining that? She was completely depressed. She hasn't been herself for a long time. Interesting. Please allow me to extent my sympathy. Over Can't believe it's over That our love has ended Before it had its start Don't know Where it is I'm going Is there life still flowing Within my heart Must you Tell me why I've lost you When we've had tomorrow Now I understand your feelings, but don't worry, I'm here. I know how surprised you are to see me. You were wrong to think I abandoned you. Aren't you feeling well? You're so pale. All I can say is that you're smarter than I thought. I should've known all along. How did you manage it? Thanks to you, I've been discovering the fun of being dead. Remember the old gardener? Well he thought it was fun too helping you while I knew everything. In fact, I knew it from the start, darling. And I had to interfere with your plans just because I didn't want to die. You did the whole thing most intelligently and I'm proud of you. I'm having a nightmare. The burglars admitted that they murdered you. And there was blood on the boat. Yes, I know. I let them believe they really knocked me out. And I knew what was going to happen to me when I heard your act. And when I saw my gun in your girlfriend's hand. You're a monster. I can't go on. I'd prefer to kill myself. Elizabeth, it's not what you think. And then I understood you were going to kill me and set it up like to look like a suicide. Unfortunately for you, the burglar saved my life without knowing it. I made the marks leading to the boat myself, as if my body had been dragged. And I left my earring on the ground. I put the blood on the boat too. It was all very easy. After that, I told Burckhardt about it. I must say, he acted his part like a real pro. And I watched you getting caught up in your own net. So Burckhardt knew everything. No, part of it only. If I told him you really wanted to kill me, he would've told the police right away. And Vanetti? I made up the whole ring business. Oh, I'm sorry. I arranged it all with the man who delivers our fish. Your hand is shaking. Now be calm, dear. And the anonymous letter was yours also? Well, of course. I knew you needed to produce a body in order to get my inheritance when I disappeared. There was only one solution left. Congratulations. I can't fight all this. You're too strong. You've won all the way through and I've lost. You can send me directly to prison. I thought of it, you know. Then thinking it over again, I realized taking your place, I wanted to kill her also. You must admit you did everything to help me. Mhmm. And how, my darling. All because I wanted to keep you for myself. I've grown accustomed to you. It's too late for me to change. You know, a man as gifted as you are is very difficult to find. You're the only one who can save me from jail. You'd much prefer staying with me, I know. But saving you is much more difficult than you'd think. I do not exist, you see? I was killed in a car accident. You poor widower. Ralph? That our love has ended Before it had its start Don't know Where it is I'm going Is there life still flowing Within my heart At your service. Leave the light on. I want to see you. Yes. I want to see my murderer. It's exciting to think of all you've done to kill me. How could I allow you Come on, darling, kill me again. To get away What is the lucky life for me I just had to fly to see That I would need you constantly I hope you'll forgive me. I know it's a little late for a visit. I guess you're evidently retired for the evening. I guess it's a good guess. But unfortunately I must ask your wife a few questions. My wife? But how can you say that? She came to see me before the funeral. She must've told you. Elizabeth, I'm sorry, but the Inspector wants to see you. Elizabeth? I think she's asleep. Let me come in. It's very important. Well I can't stop you if it's that urgent. Oh no, Inspector. I thought I explained everything. Yes you did and now we have confirmation that the woman who died yesterday in the car is Gina Barcoff, but there are still some details. Details? All right, let's talk them, but hurry. You've declared you lent her your car and that she seemed very nervous when she left you. Oh, just a little. You know how female nerves are. The bag found near Gina Barcoff's body had initials on it. E.S. How do you explain that? I didn't use that bag anymore so I gave it to her. But I'm shocked that she didn't have the monogram taken off of it. What about the coat? Was that a gift too? No, not the coat. Gina had an appointment in Z?rich to meet an important film producer. She thought being elegant would help her a lot in getting the part. I see. Oh, that's your ring, darling. We lent that to her too. I see. It's impossible to say no to such a dear friend. One mustn't exaggerate. One can be extremely generous but not lend everything. She's right. It's a pity the victim wasn't a reddish blonde because then she could've been the woman assaulted in your villa the other night. Oh, but Gina's hear was that color. At least, a week ago it was. But what could she have been doing in your house? A few days later she told me. But it's most embarrassing to say though. What did she tell you? She said she went to my house so as to catch my husband while he was having a special kind of party. Yes, the poor girl loved him, you see. Yes, and I think that was one of the reasons why she killed herself. Is that so? Well, I'll be going now. And excuse me for disturbing you. Would you like a drink, Inspector? My wife should've asked you before. It would be awfully nice if you accept it. No, thank you Mr. Schroeder, I have work to do. So do I. I'm sure your job is more pleasant than mine. It has its ups and downs. Well, good luck. Nice couple, those two. There you are now, back to bed. Sorry but your vacation's over, my dear. It's time to get back to work and no more fellows. My life is yours, Elizabeth. And I'm gonna take advantage of it every single minute. You will become my personal slave. You wanted me to be dead, didn't you? You better try killing me with love. That's easier said than done. Oh, come on. I guess I have to obey your orders. I have no orders. Only desires. My murderer.
