SOUNDS GREAT. NO, THANKS. I'M GONNA HANDLE THE PAPERWORK MYSELF, ALL THE DETAILS. ALL I NEED YOU TO DO, ALL THEY NEED YOU TO DO, IS HELP THEM GET THIS CAR READY. YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME, MS. BEECHER. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR LITTLE PROJECT. YOU ARE A TEACHER HERE, AREN'T YOU? COME HERE. LOOK AROUND. YOU SEE ALL THIS? EVERY FALL THEY DRAG THIS CRAP IN HERE, SAYING HOW THEY'RE GONNA FIX THINGS UP. AND EVERY SUMMER, I CALL THE SCRAP YARD AND HAVE THEM HAUL IT ALL AWAY. THEY'RE QUITTERS, THAT'S ALL. THEYDON'TFINISHANYTHING, EVER. WHICH IS JUST WHAT YOU'RE FINDING OUT, AND WHY I DIDN'T GET INVOLVED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY'RE KIDS. THEY NEED HELP. THEY NEED OUR HELP. THEY'RE LOLOS, LADY.

BANQUET FACILITIES. DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT YOUR NAME IN? WHATEVER. I KNOW YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED, BUT YOU'LL FIND ANOTHER HOBBY. IT WASN'T A HOBBY, DAD. IT'S JUST THAT I'M NOT THAT GOOD AT A LOT OF THINGS, DAD. LIKE SCHOOL, FOR INSTANCE. I WAS THE SAME WAY. BUT WITH DESIGNING, IT'S DIFFERENT. I SEE THINGS. IT'S CLEAR TO ME, YOU KNOW? AND I'M GOOD AT IT. I MEAN, I COULD BE. YOU CAN'T ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, DANIEL. SOMETIMES YOU'VE JUST GOTTA DO WHAT'S THERE. TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP, HUH?

HOW CAN WE HELP YOU? THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S NOT EXACTLY A PROBLEM BUT IF WE WIN THE RACE, THEN WE GO ON TO AUSTRALIA.

I HAVE GOT $60 MILLION IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WAITING TO CLEAR CONGRESS. THAT IS A LOT OF SOLAR CELLS, AND I AM NOT RISKING CELTECH'S REPUTATION OR MY FORTUNE, ON A BUNCH OF KIDS IN A YELLOW GO-CART. WE SAID WE'D SPONSOR AND WE CAN'T RENEGE ON THIS. IT'S PART OF THE U.S. PACKAGE. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT. I JUST WANT IT FIXED. TELL US ABOUT YOUR STRATEGY, THIS DOUBLE BATTERY IDEA. ASK DANIEL. HE'S THE ONE WHO CAME UP WITH THE WHOLE IDEA. DANIEL, YOU THE MAN! GOOD CALL, MAN! EXCUSE ME. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT! THE KONA-PALI TEAM. IT'S AN AMAZING EFFORT. IT'S JUST GREAT.

MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT THE TOP U.S. ENTRIES IN THIS YEAR'S WORLD SOLAR CHALLENGE ARE RUN BY CELTECH'S FAMED ZIGON SOLAR CELLS. WE WOULD LIKE YOU, OUR ONLY HIGH SCHOOL TEAM, TO HAVE THAT SAME ADVANTAGE, ALL RIGHT? THAT MEANS WE'RE GONNA BE RETROFITTING YOUR PANELS AND OVERALL DESIGN. YOU MEAN, REBUILD THE CAR? WAIT A MINUTE! NO, OUR TECHNICIANS CAN DO WONDERS. NO, WE DON'T NEED YOUR HELP OR YOUR SOLAR CELLS. JUST GIVE US OUR PLANE TICKETS AND GET OUT OF THE WAY, MAN. YO, BRAHS. MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GET IT OUT OF HERE? IS THERE A PROBLEM? YES, THE CAR. THE CAR IS A PROBLEM. IT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE ENTIRE U.S. EFFORT. EITHER GET THIS CAR RUNNING, OR PACK YOUR BAGS AND GO HOME. WHO ARE YOU AGAIN? WHO ARE YOU? I'M THE SHOP TEACHER. UNFORTUNATELY, I'M YOUR SPONSOR. AND IF THERE'S ONE MORE SCREW-UP OUT OF YOUR TEAM, I WILL REVOKE YOUR ELIGIBILITY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? YEAH. NOW LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE'RE GONNA RUN IN THIS RACE WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR SO-CALLED SPONSORSHIP. YOU LISTEN TO ME-- AND IF I SEE YOU TOUCH ONE OF MY KIDS AGAIN, I'M GONNA PERSONALLY REVOKE BOTH YOUR LEGS. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? UH, TECHNICAL STUFF. DANNY? [Hans] COMEON! GETTHEMOFFTHETRACK. MOVE IT! GOD! [Judd Potter] AND HERE COMES THE PACK NOW, ABSOLUTELY FLYING DOWN THE STUART HIGHWAY. U.S. CELTECH AND SOLAR FLARE HAVE TAKEN COMMAND OF THIS FIELD, AT WHAT SEEMS TO BE A RECORD-SETTING PACE. THE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS FROM HAWAII WHO BROKE DOWN AT THE START ARE IN LAST PLACE. LET'S CHECK THE LEADER BOARD AND SEE HOW THE REST OF THE COMPETITORS ARE DOING. YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH YOUR CAR DURING OFF HOURS SO LONG AS IT'S NOT A HAIR PAST THIS LINE COME START TIME TOMORROW. QUESTIONS? YEAH. HOW FAR ARE WE BEHIND? HARD TO SAY. THEY'RE A WEE BIT OUT OF RADIO RANGE JUST NOW. [Sighing] HEY! DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. THAT OLD STUART HIGHWAY HAS A WAY OF EVENING THINGS OUT. OUT OF 42 STARTERS, WE'VE ALREADY GOT FIVE FALLEN BY THE WAY. LIKE I SAY, IT'S A ROUGH HIGHWAY. ** [Aboriginal Singing] ** ** [Singing Continues] HEY, LOOK GUYS! IT'S THAT RUSSIAN LOLO. SHUT UP, MAN.

[All Laughing] [Judd] AFTER JUST TWO DAYS OF RACING, A FREAK DUST STORM HAS SIMPLY DECIMATED THE FIELD, WITH SCORES OF CARS REPORTEDLY DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. U.S. CELTECH CONTINUES ITS COMMANDING LEAD WITH THE REST OF THE FIELD LITERALLY SPREAD OUT OVER HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS. [Braz] EURO - TEAM! HEY! LOOK, IT'S THE EURO-TEAM.

[Cheering, Laughing] CAN WE HAVE A SPOKESMAN HERE? HOW ABOUT A SPOKESWOMAN? LUANA! IT'S LUANA!
