FIRST LOVE Based on the novella "Erste Liebe" by Ivan Turgenev Who are the new neighbours? Princess Zasekina, Madame. Princess? An impoverished one, I suppose? Yes, Madame, it is said she does not even own a carriage. They rented three cabs and the furniture they brought isn't what one might call elegant, Madame. Well, it could have been worse... At least---a princess! Is that extraordinary? I mean, we could write home that we have a princess for a neighbour. It is not exactly polite to stare at young ladies in this manner, young man. - Where are you going? - Into town. - Can I come with you? - No, not today. Why are you so happy? Have you shot a crow? No. I didn't hit a thing. - Did you hunt already today? - Yes, at 4 in the morning! - Come on, let's race. - You'll give up soon! - I won't! I always win! - Never, never, never! Run, Jano! Go! Gallop! Don't give up! I never give up! Don't knock down the trees! Alexander! Alexander! Why do you not answer when I call you? But I did. Where has your father gone? Into town. Into town! He is never here when I need him. What happened? I've received a letter from that princess, our new neighbour. - From the princess? - She wants to be invited. May I read it? Terrible handwriting... Yes. And her orthography isn't good either. She sounds rather common. Anyway, she appears to want something. I'm afraid we'll have to invite her. You don't need to read it all! Just go and invite her for lunch tomorrow. - What about the daughter? - Her, too, of course. What choice do we have. - Where are you going? - Putting on a tie! What do you want? Is Princess Zasekina home, please? Bonifati, have you been to the police station yet? You've got a visitor. Huh, somebody's come? The young man from next door. Show him in then, show him in... Please step into the drawing room, Monsieur. Forgive me, are you Princess Zasekina? Yes, yes, yes, I am Princess Zasekina. And you are the son of our neighbour! Sit down. Five hundred seventy-two... Excuse the mess, we've just moved in. Five hundred seventy-three… Do sit down. There. Just move the books. Well? I... I come on behalf of my mother. Bonifati! What have you done with my keys? - You haven't seen them, have you? - No. No... My mother asks if you and your daughter would like to lunch with us tomorrow. With pleasure, with pleasure, we'd be delighted to. Of course we'll come. You are very young... How old are you? 16. Ah yes, those are the blossoming years... You don't have to be formal with me, we lead a very simple life. Do you visit the countryside often? No. My father's rented the house just for the summer. But his family used to live here. In that very house? No, no. The old house is almost completely destroyed. I don't like rural life. I find it very boring. Especially the evenings. There's simply nothing to do. And all those flies! Still, after all the unrest in the city it's probably safer here. Oh, Sinaida... This is the son of our neighbours. What did you say your name was? Alexander. Ah, Alexander! I once knew a police officer named Alexander. Charming man. Bonifati, I've found the keys, you can stop looking. I already saw him, this Monsieur Alexander... May I call you that? Where? Where have you seen him? - Are you busy right now? - No. - Good, you can help me wind some wool. - Go on, she won't bite you. Come. Sit down. What did you think of me yesterday? I think you didn't like what you saw. Did you? You don't know me yet. I am peculiar. I want to be told the truth, always. You are 16. And I am 21. As you can see, I'm much older than you. So you must always tell me the truth. And obey me. Look at me. Why don't you look at me? I like you. I like your face. I have a feeling we're going to be friends. Do you like me, too? - Princess… - First of all, call me Sinaida. And secondly, I really don't understand why children... I mean, young men... never say what they feel. They leave it to the grown-ups. So you do like me? Yes. Yes, I like you very much. I mean it, honestly. Are you still in school? Well... It's a kind of school. It's actually much more. I'm a student. I'm starting university soon. I see, you're fully grown up. The way you look at me... Sinaida, come! The lieutenant has brought you a kitten. A kitten! Oh, how adorable you are! Come here! Look at that little tail. You are so cute! Come, come! Yesterday, you said you wanted a tabby kitten with big ears. Your wish is my command. So, today, I bring you one. Chérie. [Darling.] Oh, thank you so very much. You are marvellous. - No, you are marvellous. Bonifati, quickly, the milk. It's hungry. You couldn't have made me any happier! How sweet of you! Always at your service! - My poor darling. - A soldier for his queen! How rosy his little tongue is! And how big his maw. Maw? All the better to eat you with. Take it outside, Bonifati. For the little kitten, a little kiss. Two little kisses. He's a naughty kitten. But he's so pretty. So very pretty. - What is it? - Your mother is waiting for you... Why are you leaving so early? I must to go home. So I can tell my mother you'll come tomorrow? Do so, young man, do so. Be sure to visit us again, Monsieur Alexander. I knew the father. Lived in Paris for a while. Was quite rich. But he gambled away his entire fortune. And then, for inexplicable reasons, quite possibly for her money, he married the daughter of a lowly public servant. Very ordinary family. Started gambling again, with her money, and ended up bankrupt a second time. We can only hope she doesn't want money from us. It's possible. But it doesn't have anything to do with tomorrow's lunch. Didn't you say you have invited the daughter, too? I've heard she's a very charming and well-educated girl. Then she doesn't take after her mother. Nor after her father. He was well-educated, too, but stupid. Sinaida… Sinaida… - Is that the young princess? - Yes. Have you met her yet? Yes, this morning, when I went to see her mother. Oh, the government... Spare me the subject! One should think they would show one a little repect. But no. Not an ounce. People today no longer know what respect is. - May I? - Please. This is delicious..! And the debt my husband has left me... In the past someone in my position could expect to be extended a little credit... But nowadays, they say we must be democratic. Is it democratic to deprive an old widow of any chance to live decently? Oh, before I forget: I went to the post office this morning. All lines of communication with the city are down. I just wanted to tell you in case you didn't know. Now, this ambassador had been dead for some years, I believe. Ambassador of which country? Not the faintest idea. Everything is so confused these days. Anyway, the servant led him into the cellar, and there it was: half a horse. In the cellar? That's where they hid it. No one was supposed to know about it. Is that the girl you spoke of earlier? She's very pretty. Very pretty indeed. Now I remember! Of one of the Balkan countries, I believe. Didn't you say he is dead? He is. It was merely his house. Where is that noise coming from? From the factory next door. Ah yes---where they make that terrible wallpaper. Curious. Why build an ugly factory right next to such a beautiful mansion... You see, financial difficulties forced the owner to sell one wing of the house. And that wing was turned into a factory. Je comprends. [I understand.] - And you are renting the main wing? - Yes. The family of your husband used to live here, did it not? - Not in this house. But close by. - Ah, I see. His family used to be very wealthy, was it not? Then they lost everything. Ah--- That's why he married you? Well anyway, it's terrible, terrible. - Excuse me. The newspaper? - Yes. Put it down over there. Well, now, you surely know the higher- ranking officials of this district? - I'm afraid we don't. - How fortunate. That is why I turned to you, and to your dear husband. Such a distinguished gentleman! You would be doing me a great favour if you asked these people to leave me alone, in peace. The police can be so difficile if one is not influential. [difficult] I don't think there is anything we can do. Then that's settled. Good. Such delectable food! Fresh fruit... In the city, such things are impossible to find nowadays. And the cheese there is dry. You don't even realise how lucky you are here in the countryside, to be able to entertain like this. We don't know what we are supposed to serve our guests. And the wine... Tastes of putrid water. Unpalatable! Oh well, c'est la vie. [That's life.] Now. Please allow me to thank you so very much. I've enjoyed myself greatly. Oh, you wouldn't mind if I borrowed your newspaper, would you? Yes... Does your radio still work? - I'll make certain your paper is returned to you. - Yes? - Yes. Now, I'm fully relying on your support. Don't forget. We'll do whatever we can, of course. Ah, je descendre. [I am stepping down.] Your servant will escort us? How charming. Come to our soirée tonight at eight. [party] No matter what. Still raining, sadly. Well, here I stand, nothing less than a princess. But of what use is the prettiest title if one doesn't have enough to eat? That conceited daughter of hers... sat there... with such arrogance... with such haughtiness. I'd just like to know what she is so proud of. With her… mine de grisette. [working-class face] Have you ever seen a grisette? [working-class woman] Thank God I haven't. How do you know what one looks like then? And that hat of hers... Have you ever in your life seen such a crazy thing? I ask you: had you ever before seen anything that tawdry? Over here! Come on, give it to me! Over here! Stop, stop, a new guest. Bonjour, Monsieur Alexander. - Who's that? What are you doing here? - He's the neighbour's son. Come down, we'll give you a lot for the raffle. (I invited him.) - Come down, hurry! - That's unfair! He didn't even join in. - Come, come! - Why wouldn't he be allowed to join? He's here for the first time, so we'll change the rules. Write another lot. I find it unfair, too! What is this... a rebellion? Bonjour, Monsieur Alexander! Allow me to introduce you. This is Dr. Lushin. The poet Maidanov. Konstantin Maidanov. This is Belovzorov. My wild beast... You two already know each other. This is Malevsky. Count Malevsky. Oh, excusez-moi! [excuse me] And this is our host, Nirmatsky. Colonel Nirmatsky, retired. What's your drink? Now, listen closely, young man. We're playing a game of forfeits. Sinaida lost. Lot please. As punishment, she may... give the winner a kiss. - Sinaida, there. - Let's see... Maidanov, you as poet should be more generous and give your lot to Alexander so he's got two chances... instead of one. Never! The last shall be first. Kiss! Damn! - Bravo---he's won! - Kiss! I am glad. You, too? Sell me your lot. How much do you want for it? Sell? My kiss? Bravo! Kiss me. Kiss me. Here? No. Come. Come to the other room. Oh no! Adhere to the rules. As master of ceremonies I decree that you stay here. In the glass cabinet! - Yes! In the glass cabinet! - Put them into the glass cabinet! - Do it! Do it! - In with you two! Come on. Kiss each other. - Go for it! - Kiss! What's the hold-up? - He's scared. - He's scared! - Kiss! - Come on, kiss! No! No cheating! That's not allowed! Why? I would have done the same. Wouldn't you? It's unfair, unfair! Stop it! Very discreet. But too long. - Enough. Enough! - They just won't stop. - Stop it! - Enough! - Will you two finally stop? - Unbelievable. Well, did you kiss her? Bravo. The poem is called... ‘The Murderer'. Silent stood the marble Silently glittered the glass... It spans across six books. This is volume 3. I'd have liked to recite the beginning for you but I think this better fits the current political situation. Dr. Lushin... Would you mind? Thank you. I'll begin again. Silent stood the marble Silently glittered the glass Silent stood the guard in the wind... frozen into bronze. Perhaps... I think I need to explain. Specify. This tyrant... this inhumane tyrant, is dead. Finally, after... after such a long time, he seems to be dead at last. But the people still do not dare believe he is really dead. They fear he might, without reason or warning, rise again. And thus, they would lose all their hope and their freedom. Dr. Lushin, if you'd please listen, too. Dr. Lushin! Thank you. I'll start from the top again. Silent stood the marble Silently glittered the glass Silent stood the guard in the wind... frozen into bronze. But the coffin fumed... Air breathed through the cracks as they carried him out of the mausoleum. The coffin slowly cut its way onwards, softly grazing the bayonets. It was as silent as they were. But his silence... was menacing! Grim, his embalmed fists clenched, within hid a human. One who only feigned death. Each and every face, he memorises. Everyone who is carrying him outside. Power, he draws from this sight. To escape his grave. Because... he wants to return to them, to life! Wants to live with the unreasonable! His dreams have not been buried with him. Biding his time, cowering in the dark, he forges plans---the tyrant. So, I tell you... I call upon you, our government: do not ignore this looming crypt. Double the guard! No! Triple it so he is not ever able to rise again! - Ah! - Bravo! - A wild animal! - You are a wild animal... I've got it! I've got it! You'll get used to it... That wasn't his poem. He always steals poems of others. - Who are these people? - My relatives. They all live at my expense. Tell me your secret. I can't say it. You have to. Tell me your secret. Steadily further down! Further, further down! Oh Doctor, oh Doctor! I am in pain, I am in pain! Where? Here? Oh no. Steadily further down! Further, further down! Do you hear that? What was that? Nothing. Detonations, over at the quarry. At night? Steadily further down! Further, further down! Renovate---what for? Soon, everything is going to collapse anyway. I have a secret. Do you want to hear it? My secret is that I am the sole human without a shred of mystery about him. What is mysterious about me is that I do not have a single secret. Look! I love you, Sinaida. I love you. You are not to spend time with those people. They are not comme il faut. [proper] You should be studying. It was already morning when you came home. If you always go to bed so late, it's no wonder you can't get up in the morning. - Where were you? - With friends. Who? - The princess... - They are bad company! I thought you were mature, and sensible. And then you spend half the night with people who are in debt. Is that really so important? Would you please leave the education of my son to me? Elle est une femme capable de tout. [She is a woman capable of anything.] Come, let's walk to our old house. Tell me about Sinaida. As children, we always played in here. Back then. My father used to sit at this window in the evenings. All that you can see from here belonged to him. Look! This was our dining room. Do you know what gives people freedom? No, what? Willpower. Their own will. And power, too. Which is even better than freedom. Once you know what you want, you'll be free. And rule. Saddle my horse. - Can I come with you? - Not this time. Go riding by yourself if you want. And tell the coachman I'm not going riding after all. I've got to go someplace else. - Can you type? - Yes, a little. Would you type a letter for me? I'd be glad to. I'll be right there. Come over here. Sit down here. Just like that. Now. All I want is for you to copy this. As you can see, I've already drafted it. These machines are so difficult to operate. I tried, but I wasn't very successful. Can you read my handwriting? Get started! It's a very important letter. Go on! Go on, start typing. Type! Sina... is that you? Sina? I love you because I must love you! I love you because I couldn't do anything else! I love you by heavenly decree! I love you because of... because of a magic spell! Give me your hand. You are always oh so brave but in a moment, you will be embarrassed in front of this young man. Does that hurt? Not in the least. Not if it gives you pleasure. And neither does it hurt... that I'm only toying with you? Why don't you marry me? Sun of joy! Oh joy of the sun! Oh eyes, so suck up the light of the sight of my eyes. Oh angelic singing. Heavenly beginning. Oh heaven on earth, won't you come to me! Oh joy of the sun! Oh sun of joy! Oh delightful cheeks, you my desire wake. Oh joy of the sun! Oh sun of joy! I love you because I must love you! I love you because I couldn't do anything else! I love you by heavenly decree! I love you because of... a magic rhyme! You, I love. Like the rose its bush. You, I love. Like the sun its shine. You, I love because you are my breath of life! You, I love because loving you is what I am. Do you really love me? Very much? Yes. I see it in everything you do. The very same eyes. The very same eyes. I've done everything wrong. If only I could run away... anyplace, the farther away the better. Oh God, I'm so unhappy, so unhappy. But why? Recite a poem for me. You sing a little, but that doesn't matter. It sounds so young. Perhaps "Upon the Hills of Georgia"? The darkness of night lies over the hills of Georgia and the roar of the river Aragva reaches my ear. I am so sad, so quiet. My sorrow is deep and vivid. And anguish fills me. Anguish for you. My longing is pure, and my heart burns with love for you. I can't help it. Only loving you lends purpose to my life. I can't help it. Only loving you lends purpose to my life. I don't even want to hear it! Let's go. Maidanov is with Mama. He brought a poem for me but I walked out on him. He's probably cross with me now. But there's nothing to be done about it. ...has secretly... ...has secretly... a rival in love bested you... unexpectedly... maybe? - I can't go on! - Please, listen. Just this one verse. Has secretly a rival in love bested you unexpectedly... maybe. One day you will find out. Don't be angry with me when you do. Why do you keep hanging around here, young man? Shouldn't you rather be studying, while you're still young? Why would you assume I don't study at home? Very well, if you say so. Is she ill? Well, she's feeling under the weather. I'll give her something. I don't know if you've made a very good choice. What do you mean? Someone's got to warn you, I think. Can't you see what is going on in this house? It may be all right for an old bachelor like me, but you're too young for this. The atmosphere here is not good for you. It is unhealthy. What is unhealthy? Young man, young man, you can't fool me. It's written all over your face. I know I shouldn't be one to talk. I shouldn't be coming here either. Sure, the scent inside a greenhouse is beautiful and narcotic. But you wouldn't want to spend your entire life in one, would you? Don't you know what goes on here? - What goes on here? - It'd be better to study, Alexander. And to forget all this. Pourquoi est-ce tu dois me regarder toujour comme ça? [Why do you always have to look at me like that?] The atmosphere here is bad for you. Whom are you going to see tomorrow? Are you going to the mausoleum again? With whom? Please don't... I... always go to the mausoleum by myself. By yourself? I do not believe you. With whom? Say it. Tell me. What are you doing here? Spying on me? Come here! Come! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts you? And me? Does it not hurt me? Poor Alexander! What have I done? Oh well. I'll wear this as a talisman. Perhaps it will comfort you. Now go away. I told you to go! Why won't you leave me alone? You keep saying you love me. If you really love me, jump down! Oh God. My poor boy. What have I made you do? Why did you do this? Why did you obey me? You know I love you. What do you think you are doing? Get up! You're not even hurt, you comedian. Don't look at me like that. Go home, at once! And don't ever dare follow me again. The riots began shortly before 11 when the military tried to push back a few thousand strikers across the bridge between the industrial area and the city centre. At first, the soldiers used their truncheons, then they hit them with their bayonets, and finally, shots were fired. Immediately, open riots broke out. The masses, who saw dead and dying people everywhere, the pavement splattered with blood, cried out for vengeance. Do... do you think we should leave? Alexander! My God... what have you done? What have you done? You're hurt. You're hurt! What's the matter? Tell me what's wrong. Why are you so sad? Nein? Can't you tell me? I get so worried when you disappear and I don't know where you are or with whom. You don't have to tell me. I know how you feel. Don't cry. Don't cry. She isn't worth it. She isn't worth it, my little boy. Suppose you were married, how would you treat your wife? Would you lock her up? Sure. And remain with her, all alone? Absolutely. Very good... but what if she got tired of it? And betrayed you. Then I'd kill her. And if she ran away? I'd catch her and kill her, now more than ever. Now, let's suppose I were your wife. What would you do then? Kill myself. - Ah, my young friend! - Monsieur Alexander... So you are still alive? We haven't seen you in a very long time. You deserted us. Come, sit down. Come. We're making up stories. Everyone has to tell something they've never told before. Sinaida. Yes. Now it's my turn. You must imagine... a splendid hall... a summer night, and a wonderful ball. A young queen hosts this ball. Everywhere, there is... gold, marble, crystals, lights, flowers. All the beautiful things in life. A question. Does the queen have a husband? No. Why a husband? Indeed, why a husband? Silence. Merci. [Thank you.] The queen listens to the music but doesn't look at a single guest. Six windows are wide open and beyond them, in a dark sky, the stars are shining. In the garden, the trees rustle in the wind. And the queen looks out into the garden. There, beneath the trees, stands a man in the darkness. And the queen thinks: All of you are elegant, clever, rich. Every one of my words is precious to you. All of you are ready to die for me. I own you. But outside, in the garden, waits the man I love. He is not rich, not dressed elegantly, no one knows him. But he's waiting for me. And he knows I'm coming. And I will come. And no power in the world can keep me from going to him and giving myself to him, and forgetting everything, everything with him. There... in the darkness of the garden. You've made all this up? But what about us, gentlemen? If we were among those guests and knew about that fortunate man in the garden. What would we do? I can tell you exactly... - No, wait! I'll tell you myself what each of you would do. - What? You'd challenge him to a duel, Belovzorov. - Of course you would. - Are you sure about that? And, Maidanov, you'd write an utterly scathing, trenchant article about him. Yes, exactly! Oh, no---you wouldn't. You are unable to be hurtful. You would write a poem. At most you would, with fiery, romantic poetry, condemn his politics. And you, Nirmatsky, you'd sponge money off him. Oh, no, you'd lend him money at extortionate interest rates. As far as you are concerned, Doctor... Yes? I don't know what you'd do. As your doctor I'd advise you not to host parties if the guests mean nothing to you. Perhaps you're right. And you, Count Malevsky. What about me? You would send him poisoned chocolates. And you, Alexander... No, enough of this. Let's play something else. He would follow her, like a dog. As her page, of course. You have no right to be insulting. I must ask you to leave. - Yes. Sinaida is right. - I was only kidding. - I assure you, I didn't intend to insult anyone. - But you did! All right, you may stay. Perhaps we got upset about nothing. You must take pleasure in hurting others. Are you still angry? That's ridiculous. After all, it wasn't me who appointed you page. She gave you that title. However, you do not perform your duties very well. Why not? Well, you should never leave your mistress alone. You should know everything she does. You should watch her, day and night. What do you mean by that? Day and night. During the day, it's light and there's always someone around. But at night... At night, one's got to be ready for anything. Listen closely to my advice. Don't sleep. Watch. Keep your eyes open and pay attention. Especially in the garden, tonight. Tonight... Don't go away... my beautiful gypsy... Where will you go? You're splattered with blood. What have you done? Nothing at all. Nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing! Nothing at all. Alexander... Where are you going at this hour? - The garden. - This late? - It's only 9.30. - It's 10. - Where's Father? - Out. He'll be home late. Don't go... Stay with me. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. All right. I'll wait up for you. You don't have to bother. Who's there? Who's there? Sinaida... Yes... Yes, keep going... Pourquoi... [Why...] Beautiful... Beautiful... Come... Come. Come! Well done. Alexander, there you are. I've brought you a friend. My brother. Come, children, shake hands. Be nice to him. Show him the garden. Don't be so stiff, children. Enjoy yourselves. - Want to see the garden? - As you wish, Monsieur. Come on! Why don't you undo your collar? I don't mind it, Monsieur. We are used to it. Why did you want my love? Why did you toy with me? It is my fault. I know. I've done you wrong, I know. But I'm not playing with you. I love you. You have no idea how... and why. I love you. I love you. But what do you know... How much of me is bad... How much is dark... sinful... And how much of me is foolish. But I'm not playing with you! I love you. You have given her money? It's a loan. The old lady needs it. It is MY money. I told you, it's merely a loan. You've never taken care of your family. You are always looking for something else. You're cold... You're heartless. At your age, I wouldn't say something like that. I cannot bear it any longer! In front of everyone! Philip! Theodor! My husband and I have decided to go back to the city. Pack the suitcases and get everything ready. Goodbye? Why "goodbye"? We're going back to the city. I thought you wouldn't leave until autumn. My mother... isn't very comfortable here. Oh, I understand that. I have been uncomfortable ever since the moment we arrived. I have a constant headache... and I'm always so tired. Come. Constant headache... and always so tired... always so tired... I've come to say goodbye. Probably forever. We're leaving. Is it this easy for you to go? Thank you for coming by one last time. I was afraid I wouldn't see you again. Remember me fondly. I know I've been cruel. But I'm not as bad as you think. Really, I am not. You don't have a high opinion of me. - Me? - Yes, you. Whatever you do... However cruel you are to me... I will always love you, Sinaida. I will adore you until the end of days. Farewell. Farewell. Farewell. Maybe... it is the last time that your hand rests in mine. So close your blood to my blood. Oh if you knew my anguish! But you smile heroically with your eyes' silent beam. You, wayfarer, do not know how it feels. It may be the last time. ...it may be the last time? It may be the last time. Maybe it is the last time! Young man! Dr. Lushin! Still young. But a little more grown up. What do you do? Study? Not so much. You aren't over it yet? That's all right. The important thing is that you don't wallow in your feelings too much. I'm coming! Else you won't amount to much in life. Stand on your own two feet. Even though it is not easy. Have you seen any of the others? Excuse me, I've got a bit of a cough. Belovzorov... Have you heard? No... What? Vanished, without a word. A lesson for you, young man. If one can't let go in time... Well, at least you got through it all right. Don't get dragged back in... No... I won't ever see her again. A race? On that old nag of yours? You'll never catch up with me. Sure I will! I've got spurs, too! Then let's go! Go! Come on! Go! - Yes! Good! - Don't give up! I'll catch up with you! Watch out! Dismount. Wait for me, please. Got some tobacco for me? Vous devez vous séparer de cette femme. [You must leave that woman.] Non, je ne peux pas. [No, I cannot.] Pourquoi? [Why?] Pourquoi...? Pourquoi pas? [Why? Why not?] Je ne veux pas. [I do not want to.] Non, non. Non, je peux pas. [No, I cannot.] Where did I put my whip? What did you do with it? Was I gone long? What have you done with your whip? What have you done with your whip? Did you lose it? I threw it away. Have you heard? Madame Dolsky is here. Who's Madame Dolsky? Sinaida. The former princess. Don't you remember? Summer... the country estate... We all were in love with her... She married Dolsky? - Sure. - And she's here? - Where? - In the theatre. No, no, but she's in the city... with him. Who is he? Oh, friendly fellow. Rather wealthy. Public servant. Like me. Well... after that minor affair ---you know how she is--- she was lucky to find a husband at all. After all, the consequences had been quite obvious. And you, my friend? Still at university? My father's dead. Yes... that happens. - Has she changed? - No, no... not at all. He wrote me a letter shortly before he died. All he said was... Guard yourself against the love of women. Guard yourself against that bliss. ...that poison. Where is she staying? Hotel Continental. I'm sure she'd be happy to see you. Either way, she's more beautiful than ever. A week went by... then another... and when I finally went to the Hotel Continental and asked for Madame Dolsky, I found out that, four days ago, she'd unexpectedly died in childbed. And that's what it all had come to... So this was the end that this young, radiant, passionate life was headed for. Indifferent lips had brought me the news of her death. Indifferently, I received it. Oh youth, youth, you have no cares. You think you own all the treasures of the world. Even sorrow appeals to you. Even grief becomes you. You're self-confident and bold. You say... I alone live. And yet, even your days wane and dwindle. Without trace or number. Like wax in the sun. Like snow. A few days after I had learned of Sinaida's death I myself stood beside the death-bed of an old woman, who lived in our house. Covered with rags, on hard boards, a bag under her head she died hard and arduously. Her entire life had been one bitter struggle. She had known neither joy nor happiness. Shouldn't she have welcomed death, for its freedom and its peace? Yet, for as long as her fragile body managed to resist, for as long as her chest, under the load of her ice-cold hand, still drew breath, for as long as her final reserves of strength lasted the old woman crossed herself over and over again and whispered: 'Lord, forgive me my sins.' And I remember that there, at the death-bed of this old woman, I suddenly became fearful for Sinaida. For my father. And for myself. In memory of Dinu Lipatti (1917-1950)
