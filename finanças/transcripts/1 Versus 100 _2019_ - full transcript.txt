(dark atmospheric music) - [Woman] My father was an important man. He was vital to his community, but a coward in the face of his family. - Never been to one of these things before. - Really? You've never known anyone who's... - No, no one. Never. - Well, just make sure not to laugh or smile, or anything like that. - Okay. (strong wind blows) - Hey. - Hey, how are you doing? - I'm all right, how are you? - I don't know how I feel about it. I mean, I know I... I shouldn't care, but I actually feel sad. - Yeah, it's the same for me, too. I should be happy for Mom, but I just feel bad for her. Is she here? - Yeah, but I wouldn't go talk to her right now. She's pretty broken up. - Where is she? - The last time I saw her was over by the fence. - [Blonde Daughter] Hey, Mom. - Malia, you came. - How are you doing? - I'm doing okay. Malia, your coming, it means so much. (strong wind blows) - [Man] Hey, did you remember to get batteries? - I forgot. - [Man] Are you so fucking stupid you can't remember to buy batteries when you go to the market? - I forgot, okay, what do you want from me? - I asked you to do one god damn thing, and you can't even do that right. How the fuck am I supposed to watch the game now, huh? - All right, you want your batteries? I'll go get 'em. - Good, go get 'em. Go! (mother sighs) (gun fires) (body clunks) - I got your batteries, Larry. Larry? Oh, no. Larry. Larry. Larry, what did you do? Larry. (gasps) Oh, my god. Oh, Larry. Oh, no, what did you do, Larry? No! (sobs) (somber atmospheric music) (strong wind blows) (sobs) - Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on this solemn occasion. We're here to celebrate the life and memory of Larry Tarkovsky, a beloved husband, father, and respected attorney in our community. Now, if you please bow your heads and pray with me. God, our father. Your power brings us to earth. Your providence guides our lives. And by your command, we return to dust. Lord, those who die still live in your presence. Their lives change, but do not end. I pray and hope for my family, relatives and friends, and for all the dead known to you alone, in company with Christ who died and now lives. May they rejoice in your kingdom, where all our tears are wiped away. Unite us together again, in one family. To sing your praise, forever and ever. Amen. - Amen. - I just don't know if I appreciate being here. This is, (sighs) we're here objectifying this woman's body and it's just really uncomfortable for me. - No, you need some more booze. You try it out, you try it out. - Yeah. - Yeah! (laughs) - That felt surprisingly good. - [Friend] Good. - That's Pilates, I think. - Oh, wow. (chuckles) - [Timid Man] Yeah, no, that's definitely Pilates. - [Malia] Two days after my dad dies and I'm stripping. - [Friend] Yeah, you're doin' great, baby! - [Malia] I need out of this business. - [Friend] This is the life, all right, brother? - [Malia] Maybe I could be a waitress or a nurse. I'm good at my job, but those pigs don't deserve to lay their slimy eyes on me. - Yeah, now you're lovin' it, huh? Yeah, come on, baby! It really is outrageously sensational! - Hey, man. Could I get a drink for the young lady over here? Just whatever she's been drinking and a beer for me as well. My name's Rod, it's nice to meet you. - I'm sorry, but right now is not a good time. - [Rod] Listen, if I offended you in any way, I apologize. - It's not that, I'm just not interested. - Come on, baby, I just bought you a drink. Listen, I just wanna talk, I swear I don't play! - Look, Rod, you seem like a great guy, but if you say another fucking word to me I'll have you thrown out of here. - Is this guy bothering you? - Shut the fuck up! I'm talking to the fuckin' girl, not you! - Fuck you, man, get the hell out of my club! - Fuck you, fuck this fuckin' place! - Fuck you! - Fuck you, fuck you! - [Bartender] Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. (moody piano music) I love you so much. You're all that I'm living for. So, how have you been holding up? - I'm doing all right, I guess. Since Dad, I've just been so distant from everybody. Things between Adam and I haven't been the greatest, either. To tell you the truth, I... I think he may be seeing someone else. - Why do you think that? - Well, the other night when he came home late from work, the first thing he did was take a shower. So, I got his pants and I went through the pockets and I found a number written on the back of one of his cards. - Hey, honey. I got some chicken and some potato salad. You girls hungry? (moody electronic music) (moody piano music) - [Man] Do you live around here? - Nope, 30 minute commute. - I had a job once that took two, maybe three hours a day. In the beginning, I listened to music and podcasts to pass the time and I even enjoy driving. But after a few months, driving two hours a day became unbearable. - Sometimes I like to close my eyes when I drive and see how far I can go without crashing. And how fast can I go down windy roads without flipping over. - You ever get in an accident? - Yeah. - You know, the seem like the type of person that cares about living, just enough to stay alive. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe... You're better than this place, and want for much bigger things. - Like what? - I work for a production company that produces high-end adult films and we're looking for actresses for our next big project. It's called "1 Versus 100." - I met a guy tonight. - [Girlfriend] Oh, yeah? - He works for an adult film production company, and he offered me a job to star in a porn. It's a two-hour shoot and it pays 15 grand. - $15,000? He's full of shit. - Maybe, but once he told me what I'd be doing, it made it sense that I'd be paid that much. - You're scaring me. - I'd have sex with 100 men, and they'd each get a minute with me. - What a psycho, did you cut his dance short? - I don't know, I'm actually thinking about doing it. - Have you lost your fucking mind? - Think about it, we could put a down payment on a house, we could quit Push and then we'll have enough time to find decent jobs. We cannot be strippers forever. - Can't you ask your sister for money? - I've already borrowed like 4,000 from Jessica, and it's not fair to do that to her. Besides, I wanna do this by myself. I can't ask for help my entire life. Everybody has to do something that they aren't proud of to make it. With that kind of money, we wouldn't have to live paycheck to paycheck anymore and we could just start over. You know, and be who we wanted to be. - Right. Let's go to bed. Yeah? Talk about it later. (moody atmospheric music) - Have you been seeing my husband? Please. I need to know. - Yes. We've been seeing each other for about three months. - Did you know he was married? - He talks about you sometimes. He was gonna tell you, I know he feels real bad about it. - Do you love him? - No. No, I don't think so. I just feel so good when I'm with him. I get to escape from life and all my problems go away, to see him for a couple of hours. - Yeah. I know what you mean. He's not like that all the time, though. He turns it on and off. It's been mostly off with me recently. - Are you guys gonna get divorced? - I don't know. - [Man] I sure hope this lady worships the dollar. - [Woman] The almighty dollar. - The almighty dollar, we could use her. She takes the offer for 15 grand, we're in good shape. - We'd be lucky to get it. - What if we did somethin' like 97 plus three? Put some addition in there. - Math? Put some math in there? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, that's great. - Porn stars are smart. - Sure. - They're very intelligent. It's not like they worship the dollar or anything. - The almighty dollar. - You always talk about worshiping the almighty dollar. I'll give you something you can worship. - Oh, my goodness. - Take a look at this. - Oh, my goodness, that's a lot of white. - Wanna touch it? - No. No. - Give your hand. - Well, you know, the doctor said we should probably refrain from contact with that. - I'll touch it. - I think that's probably... - I'll touch it all night long. - Not my department, thanks. Oh, it's warm in here. So... - All right, all right, all right. We'll save that for later. - Hm, looking forward to it. - Malia, this is Antonio, Chuck and Jaimee. - Hey. - It's a pleasure to meet you, Malia. - Nice to meet you, too. - Make yourself comfortable. Malia, I would like to tell you about a business my father and I started three years ago. It's an adult film production company. To date, we have shot six feature films, and we've sold the rights to all of them. We think you'll be right for our next film. - And what are the conditions? - Two-hour shoot. One-time cash payment of $15,000. Now, you'll, you'll have sex with 100 men, one minute at a time. One by one. We predict it'll be very successful. - I changed my mind. I thought I wanted to do this, but I just have a really bad feeling about it. - You changed your mind, wait a minute. What do you mean, you changed your mind? - I changed my mind. - We can get girls to do this scene for $5,000. Ben chose you because he saw somethin' special in you, and that's why we're willing to offer you 15,000 with no previous experience. - Malia, give this a little thought. This is a big offer. And a lot of people work very hard for opportunities like this. - I have to go. I'm sorry it didn't work out. - What do you think you're doing? - Get your hands off of me! (door rattles) - Why is the door locked? Antonio, we cannot lock her in here. - [Antonio] Malia, wait, stay and talk. - Open the door. - All we ask for is that you consider our offer, and give us a call by the end of the week. - Can I go now? - Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you. She's in. (moody atmospheric music) (phone chimes) (tires screech) (phone chimes) - [Malia] This driver's terrible. Where did they even find this guy? (phone chimes) - Hey, hey, hey! (Malia screams) (phone chimes) - [Adam] What were you doin' sittin' in the dark like that? - Thinking. Thinking about our marriage. - What about it? - Sheila came by the house today. I know everything that's been going on. - I don't know any Sheila, who's Sheila? - You don't have to lie, I've thought long and hard about this and I don't want a divorce. Unless you do. - A divorce is the last thing I want. I'm so sorry. I feel sick. - Don't be sorry. Just be honest with me. - Sheila is one of my patients. After her visit, we started... I know it was wrong. I just, our sex life hasn't been that great. Sheila can never give me the love and support that you do. She just made me feel young and there was excitement about being with somebody new. - I've been reading this book about how humans are genetically predisposed to be with more than one partner. It's only recently that we've began practicing monogamy. I've been thinking about opening up our marriage. We would still have each other, but we could see other people. - Really? You're sure that'd be something you'd be okay with? Wouldn't jealousy get in the way? - To be honest, I'm more hurt about the deceit than the cheating. If you love her and want a divorce, I think you would say so. I know you love me and I love you. So, what's the big deal about seeing other people? - I just never thought you'd be open to somethin' like this. - Neither did I, but the idea of tearing apart our marriage because of this seems silly. Everything we've been through, everything we've built together, gone, because you're having sex with another woman? (sighs) I just want you to be honest with me. Do you want to stay married? - Yes. More than anything. - Where am I? - You're in the hospital. Do you remember what happened to you? - No, not much. - You were in a car accident, late last night. You suffered a compound fracture to your right wrist. It'll take a couple of months for that to fully heal. We still have some tests to run, but I think you'll be able to make a full recovery. You're very lucky. Your driver didn't make it. - He's dead? - I'm sorry to have to tell you that, but yes. (dark atmospheric music) (rain splashes) - How am I gonna pay all this rent? I screwed up big time. (phone rings and vibrates) Hello? - [Jessica] Hey, Malia, how are you doing? - I'm doing a lot better, thanks. Doctor said I should be okay in a couple of weeks. - [Jessica] I'm glad to hear that. So, what are you doing tonight? - I'm not sure, I have a frozen pizza, and probably gonna just watch a movie. I'm thinking about re-watching Saw. - [Jessica] Well, if you're not too busy, I thought it would be nice for you to come over for dinner. Adam's going to grill some steak and I'm making a salad. - That's okay, um, it's a weeknight, and I don't wanna intrude on your family dinner. - [Jessica] Well, there is something else. - What is it? - [Jessica] It's about Dad. - What about Dad? - [Jessica] I'll tell you in person. Come over, I wanna see you. - What time is dinner gonna be ready? - [Jessica] At seven? - See you then. (moody piano music) (food sizzles) (food sizzles) (door opens) Hello. - Hey. How are you doing? - I'm all right. How are you doing? - I'm good. - Pain in my wrist is about gone. - That's great. - So, what do you wanna talk to me about? - I'll tell you after dinner. - Why, is it a secret or something? - I'll just tell you after dinner, okay? (moody piano music) (food sizzles) - Hope you girls are excited. This steak is going to be outrageously sensational. One for you. - What the fuck? - Thanks. - And you. - Thank you. - And one for me. - So, Malia, remember when I told you that I thought that Adam was having an affair? Well, it turns out I was right, Adam is cheating on me. And I thought long and hard about it, and I came to the conclusion that I'm okay with it. Just because he's seeing another woman doesn't mean we should get a divorce. - I don't think we should talk about this right now. - Well, I think we should. There's nothing wrong with what we've decided to try out, which is opening up our marriage. - Well, it's very progressive. Lian and I are in a similar relationship. She's bisexual and enjoys men much more than I do. But her getting with guys is more just to satisfy an urge, rather than fulfill the needs that our relationship does. - Your relationship was kinda where I got the idea from. You both love each so much and seem so happy. How long have you and Lian been together? - About five years. - Five years, that's incredible. Jessica still hasn't found a guy to be with yet and I'm worried about how my being jealous will affect me. - Jealousy's natural, but the way to work through it is to talk about why you're jealous in the first place. Communication is the biggest part to a successful relationship. - I can't imagine getting in a fight every time Jessica wants to be with some other guy. - Well, for instance, Lian wanted to hook up with a couple she met at the club, and even though I didn't want to join in, I still felt left out. So, I asked if I could meet them, super nice, great people, and I felt better about it, gave her my blessing. I really want the best for you two, and honestly, I think this is gonna bring you closer together. (door closes) - Okay, he's gone. - So, what's so important about Dad that you couldn't tell me over the phone? - Okay, I'm just gonna say it. You're gonna think I'm crazy, but there's evidence. - Evidence of what? - I don't think Dad committed suicide. I think he was murdered and it was covered up. I first got suspicious when I found out he didn't leave a suicide note. That wasn't like him, I know he would've left one. - Well, what did you expect? Some sort of sentimental poem about life and death? - So, you don't believe me? - Not if that's the only evidence you have. - You haven't spoken to Mom recently, have you? - No, not since the funeral. - The police found her fingerprints on the gun. - Well, she probably moved it cleaning or something. - That's what I thought, but they caught her in a lie. When the police arrived on the scene, they asked if she'd ever seen the gun and she said she hadn't. They're gathering evidence against her. And there's another thing. - [Malia] What? - They found a bullet hole in Dad's tongue. When people commit suicide, they aim up towards the brain. The tongue rarely gets injured. They suspect Mom did it, but don't have anything that'll hold up in court. - And you believe the cops? - Yes. - [Man] Top scientists to question whether HIV causes AIDs. - [Anchor] The well-known lawyer who committed suicide just three months ago. Shortly after Larry's death, police began investigating the incident, not as a suicide, but as a murder. Much speculation spread stating that his wife, Susan Tarkovsky, was the one who killed him. More on the story, after this. (Susan sighs) (peaceful piano music) - Susan? - No, you must have the wrong person. - No, you're plastered all over the TV. I recognize you. Everybody in this town knows you murdered your husband. Where are you goin'? Get back here! (tires screech) - I cannot wait. I cannot wait to put my hands on that customer. She is gonna love me. Jesus Christ. Hold, hold. Hey, hi. Hello, I'll be your realty agent today. Can I help you inside? - Yeah. - Open up that door, shut it off. Come on out. Let me get that for you. Okay, then I'll just, I'll get that for you. Don't you come near this door, I've got this for you. (chuckles) Whoops. Come on in, yeah? - [Malia] Is that hard to open? - You first, ladies first. - Yeah, okay. - Hold on, don't you touch that fuckin' door, I got that. (chuckles) Okay. This here is the computer room. The digital laboratory, okay? We just kinda hang out, pass the time, while I'm waitin' for you to show. I promise I'm doing anything weird. - There is not gonna be any, like... - Not doing anything weird on company time. - So, that comes with the house? - Uh-huh, it's my gift to you. Just clear that browser history and little black market. - Okay, okay. - Let's go, come on. This is the little boys room, or I guess now that you're here, it's the little girls room. But you know, call it what you want. We've got a nice flower motif on the... - Does that come off pretty easily if... - Hush now, hush now. Just wait till the presentation's over, okay? That's a bathtub. So you can bathe in it, you can shower in it. And right here, we got a little surprise. It's a, what, (chuckles) there she blows. That's a Jackson Pollock right there, mm-hm. - I actually really like this. - Yeah, you feel that texture? Feel that texture. That's how you know it's an original. And here you got a wide range of windows, brought to you by the almighty, no, no, no, no, no. You can't, no, no, no, you do not own this home yet. You do not own this. Thank you, now look. That's okay, 'cause I wanted to show you this. You've really gotta put some oomph when you're pulling. So, like, sheyaw! Look, I lost my cool, are we cool? - Mm-hm, mm-hm. - Are we cool? You ever used a wooden toilet seat before? - Yeah, actually. - Never, never gets cold. - Yeah. - Always warm. Always there for you. Carpet in the bathroom, pretty damn stupid, but different strokes for different folks. Bathtub. So, the house, do you like it? - I like the house. - Mm-hm, that's good to hear. That's really good to hear. - What's the down payment? - $10,000. - So to be honest with you, I don't have the money for that. - Well, why are you house shopping, if you don't have that kind of money? If you don't mind me asking. - Because I was given the opportunity to make a lot of money but I decided against it. - Okay. What kinda job was it? (rhythmic piano music) - Hi! - Hi, there. - Welcome to Bodega. - Thank you. - We're closed, though. - Oh, I saw your help-wanted sign outside, and was wondering if you're still hiring. - Yes, we are, actually, we're looking for someone who can run the place by themselves. Do you have any restaurant experience? - None, as of right now, but I... - [Woman] Well, don't worry about it, don't worry about it. It's pretty easy to get the hang of. So, what do you do? - I'm an exotic dancer. (woman chuckles) - I'm sorry, but we don't hire exotic dancers. This is a wholesome place. We have families and kids, seniors. - No, look, I understand your concern. I'm trying to get out of my line of work right now, so, it's degrading and it's wearing thin. If you can just give me a chance, I am positive that I would be perfect for this position. - Look, I'm sorry, I'm sure you are a wonderful person, but I can't take that chance. So... No. (phone rings) - Hey, Ben? - [Ben] Hello. - I'll do it. (Ben chuckles) Okay. - [Man On TV] Six miles behind the enemy lines. (Lian chuckles) - Well, that's not too far. - [Man On TV] And those six miles have probably thousands of guys and every one of them was taught to shoot at uniforms like this. - [Man On TV] Why don't you keep your voice down? - Someone's calling, who is it? - It's Ben. - Do you need me to pause it? - Yeah, it'll just be a minute. - Okay. - Hello? - Hey. - [Ben] We have about all the guys. How about we shoot next Thursday? - Sounds good. - [Ben] You'll be ready by then? - I think so. - [Ben] If anything comes up, let me know. - What'd he say? - We shoot next Thursday. - Oh. - Are you sure you're okay with me doing this? 'Cause if you're not, I can call it off. - It's not about what I want. It's about what you think is the right thing to do and if you think this is right, I'm not gonna stop you. - Don't do that to me. - Do what? - Telling me that it's only my decision. We're equal in this relationship, and you need to be honest with me about how you feel. - (sighs) You want honesty? - Yes. - I don't understand why you're doing this in the first place, it's $15,000. $15,000. Is that really gonna change our lives? - Yes. It is, because I'm gonna buy us a house. I saw it last week, and I'm going to find a normal job in retail and then once I'm working steadily, I'm gonna go and take classes to become a nurse, and then you can be whatever you want to be. - Always wanted to be a journalist. - I had no idea. - Yeah. - Okay, well look, I'll be a nurse and then you can be a journalist. I'm doing this for us, I'm not just doing this for me. You can quit Push and then we'll both go to school together. So, are you okay with me doing it? - Yes. But this has to be the only one. I can't handle you being a porn star. - Just this once, and then after it, we're gonna start our new lives together. Okay? - Okay. Eskimo? (Malia chuckles) Okay. Let's finish it. (suspenseful music) - [Man On TV] We spend our lives, running our fingers down the lists and directories, looking for our real names. Our permanent addresses. (Lian laughs) - I think that taxi's so awesome. (Malia laughs) I want a taxi like that. Just press a button, "disintegrate." (chuckles) - You're dumb. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hm. - I'm the dumb one. - Mm-hm. - I love you so much. - I love you, too. (Lian chuckles) You have to do this. (dark atmospheric music) (thunder claps) I can do this. I can do this, I'm gonna be okay. No matter what happens, I'm gonna be okay. No matter what happens, I am going to be okay. (knocks) - [Antonio] Malia, Malia, come in! (men applaud and cheer) - [Malia] So many guys. - Joey! Joey! So, Joey's gonna do your hair and makeup. Been working with him for a long time, take good care of ya. And uh, we'll start in about an hour, if that's all right with you. - All right. Get out of here, get out of here right now. You don't have to do this. - [Joey] So, is this your first movie? - [Malia] You still have time, you have free will. You can get up right now and walk to the door and just leave. - [Joey] Hello, Malia, can you hear me? - Malia! Are you okay? - Yeah. - [Antonio] All right. We're gonna need you to take your clothes off. I'm gonna click the red buzzer, and when I click that red buzzer, the next wave of guys are gonna come out. All I'm gonna need you to do is just slide over a little bit get comfortable and we should be good to get goin'. - Okay. You've got this. No matter what happens, I'm gonna be okay. I can do this. - Let's go, let's go, yeah, yeah! Let's go, let's get it rockin' and rollin'! Rockin' and rollin', hit it, hit it, hit it! I want you guys to just rock it in there. Just rock it in there. Action. (Malia moans lightly) Dry that sweat on his ass. It's givin' me a glare. There it is! Sensual! (Malia moans dramatically) Hey, hey, hey, hey! This is a woman here. Do not be doin' that. Get him outta here. What are we at, 80? We've got another 20 to go. Get your flyin' dicks back there! (Malia moans and pants) This garlic's good. Flip it over! (elevator buzzes) - [Malia] I wish I could forget all of this. (water splashes) It could've been worse, right? No, that was awful. Lian was right. I've ruined my life. (screams) (peaceful orchestral music) - Chop cold tornado. - So, how's the open relationship going? Have you met anyone else yet? - I have, actually. We met at Booster Juice. (chuckles) And he reached for my smoothie, and when our hands touched, sparks, instant sparks. - Have you told Adam? - Yeah, and I thought he would be angry, but he barely responded at all. - You guys have been together for years, and this huge of a change in your relationship is gonna be difficult. But you're gonna get through it. - I know. - You just gotta make sure not to give up, when it gets rough. - I just, I wish he would tell me how he feels. I know he's hurt and jealous, but, so was I, when I first found out. - Some people bottle up all their ugly emotions. - That's Adam, he deals with things on his own time. - But how do you feel about all this? I mean you're not doing this just to get back at him, right? - I don't know, I don't think so, but then again, I was happy with just Adam. (sighs) Steven is a lot of fun, and I really enjoy spending time with him. I'm just worried he'll get attached. - Oh, he will, and when he does, you gotta be upfront about the situation. And if he wants you to leave Adam, you just gotta cut him loose. - But what if I do wanna leave Adam for him? - Do you? - No. So, what's been going on with you? - After the shoot, I quit Push, and I signed up for nursing classes next month. - What about Lian? - Well, she's still a stripper. But she's looking for a normal job. - That's good. - I've also been thinking about asking her to marry me. - Oh, my god, Malia, that's amazing. - I mean, I've just been thinking about it. I'm not sure if it's the right time, you know? What do you think? - You're ready. (woman hums melodically) - Excuse me. - Yeah, hi. - I'm looking for a wedding ring. - Oh, okay, yeah, right here. All of our rings are in this box. Is there anything in particular you're looking for? - Something traditional. Maybe like a classic gold or something? - Okay, okay, let me show you one of my favorites. It's this one. It's a round-cut diamond in the center, and it's got all the little diamonds on the band. - I think that's perfect, actually. - Is it for you? - No, it's for my girlfriend. - Oh. - I'm asking her to marry me. - Congratulations! - Thank you. - That's wonderful. - Do you think that you could engrave something on it? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay, on the inside. The date would be... 1, 14, 12. It's the day of our first kiss. - Aww, that's so sweet, she'll love it. (phone rings) (phone vibrates) - Hello? - Hi, Malia. Can you come in so we can discuss the results of your STD test? - Okay, can you meet with me in an hour? - Yeah, I'll be waiting. Hi, Malia. - Hey. - Glad you made it so quick. Malia, this is hard for me to say. I'm sorry to have to tell you that you tested positive for HIV. You're going to have to start a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor. The inhibitor should... - [Malia] I'm going to die. - [Doctor] And the inhibitor should allow you to keep your strength so you can keep on with an active lifestyle. (Malia sobs) (somber atmospheric music) - [Malia] What about Lian? Who's gonna be there to take care of her? (phone rings and vibrates) - [Ben] Uh, Malia, are you there? - Yeah, I'm here. - [Ben] There's something I have to tell you. Had some calls today. Two of the guys from the movie tested positive for HIV. The first guy to call was sixth in line. Most likely everyone after that got infected. Including you. I'm so sorry, Malia. I'm so sorry. (dark atmospheric music) - [Larry] Malia, I'd like to speak to you upstairs, please. - What? - I would like to speak to you upstairs. - [Malia] Why? - I am asking you to come upstairs and talk with me. - Why can't we talk here? - Because I'm your father and I tell you what to do! Come on, get up! You know what this is about? - No. - I, uh, I had a conversation... With your sister. She told me about a talk the two of you had, a couple of nights ago. Now do you know what this is about? She told me that you said that you were... That you're gay. Is this true? - Why do you care? - Because I'm your father, I don't want you ending up like... - Ending up like what? Why do you care who I have sex with? I am gay, Dad. I'm dating Lian and there's nothing you can do about it. - Get out. - What? - Get out! - I'm waiting for Mom to come home. - Now! This is your last chance, get out of my house! - Dad! (slap) - If you're not out of this house in the next 10 seconds, they're gonna have to wheel you out. You understand that? Do you understand that? Hey! I am sorry it has to be like this, but you know what has to happen for you to come home. - You don't have to worry about that, because I am never coming back! (Susan sighs) - You're such a fucking asshole! - Who are you yelling at? - Dad! - What happened? - Malia's gone, he kicked her out. - Where is he? - The asshole is hiding in the bathroom. (Susan sighs) - Honey? It's me, can you open the door? (handle rattles) Larry! Larry? Larry, what are you doing? What happened? - I had to do it. - Where's Malia? Where is she? - I don't know. - What does that mean? - I kicked her out. - So, what did she do? Did you finally find out about her and Lian? - You knew? You knew and you didn't tell me? How could you not tell me that our daughter was a lesbian? How the fuck could you do that to me? - Larry, you knew, you always knew, everybody knew! You're just the only one who still denies it. - You don't understand what she's doing to this family. There's no marriage, no kids, no grandkids, no nothing! - Why won't you just accept her for who she is? Why can't you?

I'm just stopping by to see Lian. - And you decided to walk? - Yeah, I just need to talk to her about something. - Well, Lian's in the shower. She should be out in just a couple of minutes. How's everything going at home? - Dad got pretty heated tonight, and so I thought it'd be best to take a walk. - I'm sorry, I know what it's like to live with a man like your father. I just want you to know that you're more than welcome to stay here any time you'd like, the door's always open. - Thank you. That means a lot. - Hey, how'd you get here? - I walked, I needed to talk to you. - Why don't you two go talk in your room? (Malia sobs) - Shh. It's okay, I'm here. Nothing bad's gonna happen to you. - I love you. - [Lian] I love you, too. My god, what happened to your face? - My dad. - [Lian] What happened? - He found out. - [Lian] Everything? - He asked me straight up and I told him. I don't wanna keep living a lie. And I told him that I'm never going back. - [Lian] Is that the truth? - Yes. (dark atmospheric music) - Hey, did you remember batteries? - No, I forgot. - Are you really so fucking stupid, you can't remember to buy batteries? How many times do I have to ask you, Susan? - I forgot, all right, what do you want from me? - I told you to get one god damn thing, and you can't even do that right. How the fuck am I supposed to watch the game now? - You could just walk over and push the buttons on the TV. - What, am I five years old? Do I look like a fucking child to you? - You want your god damn batteries? I'll go get 'em. Here are your fucking batteries. - It's the wrong fucking batteries, Susan. - Oh, they're not double-A? Weird. - You can be a real fucking cunt, you know that? You're not that type of person, Susan. You don't got what it takes. Put down the gun before you get hurt. - Shut up! - [Larry] I'm warnin' you, bitch, if you shoot me, you'd better make god damn sure I'm dead! 'Cause I'm gonna leave you in a world of pain, and that's a promise. - Get on your knees, now! - You don't got what it takes, Susan! It's not in you! (gun cocks) - I'm gonna count to five. When I get to five, you're gonna wanna die. But I won't let you. One. Two. Three. Four. Do you have any last words? - It's me. I'm your husband of 20 years! We have kids! I love you, you know that! (distant bang) (grunts) (groans) - [Susan] Get on your knees! Get on your knees. - I'm sorry! I'm sorry for everything. Oh, god. I deserve this. I deserve it all. Make it quick.

And to make this story even more tragic, the star of the adult film was Malia Tarkovsky. More on this story after this. - Oh, my god. (phone rings) (phone rings) - Jessica. - [Jessica] Mom, is that you? - Yeah, it's me. Have you heard what happened to Malia? - [Jessica] I shouldn't be talking to you. - Just wait, just please, I just, I wanna know how she's doing, I just wanna know that she's okay. Just please tell me everything's gonna be okay. - [Jessica] I don't know what to tell you. You know what's happened to her. - Just, will you tell her that I'm sorry? Just tell her that I love her. I love you both so much. I will always love you, no matter what, no matter if you hate me, or no matter what people think of me. I'll always love you. - [Jessica] Is it true what the news is saying about you? - Yes. It is. But I want you to know that it was an accident. I never intended to hurt him, I just... I don't know, maybe I did. I just don't know anymore. - [Jessica] Where are you? - I'm in Mexico City. I've got two million dollars in cash. I'm in a hotel. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just feel so lost. - [Jessica] You should've told the police what happened. That it was an accident. - You think they would've believed me? I would rather be on the run than spend the rest of my life in jail. - [Jessica] I have to go, Mom. - No, wait, just please, just talk to Malia... (sighs) - I'm here for you, no matter what. And we're gonna get through this, okay? I love you, Malia, and nothing can change that. Okay? (Malia sobs) It's okay. - [Malia] There's a point in life where you realize you can't look back.
