[music playing] Morning. [Scott] Eggs again? Excuse me, but do you live here? -No. -Hmm. -Is breakfast for you? -No. No. Then put a sock in it. [gasps, laughs] -When did you think that up? -Last night. Is the sock clean? -We're tasting? -No. Ann, I can't find that Perkins' contract. Um... It's in your attache case. Well, I can't find my attache case. Well... I know where it is. I'll go get it. Uh... You don't suppose that he's spending -too much time here with you?-Well, Marsha works nine hours. Yeah, and Marsha takes advantage of you. [Annie] No, no, no. She's letting me practice -for when we have our own kid. -Ah! [chuckles] Look, uh, honey... [clears throat] Honey, I thought we agreedto drop this adoption business. You know, it's just you and me against the world, kid. Remember? We don't need anybody else. [exhales] -[grunts] -[juice pouring] [Scott grunts] -Hey, thank you. -Do I get a reward? Uh-huh. Drink this. You get a ride to school. -[Scott] Oh. -Aw. Oh. -Um... I'll see you tonight. -[Paul] Okay. Come on. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. At the cocktail party. Right. Cocktail party. [door closing] [squeals] Okay, what are we gonna name our new friend? [indistinct chatter] Um... Kimberly. -Sheila. -Sheila? That's good. -[squeals] -Anybody else got an idea? -[Annie] Hillary? -How about Madonna? Madonna. Well, those are very good girl names, but what if this is a little boy? How can you tell? Well... [Hillary] How can you tell if it's a boy or a girl? [chuckles softly] [indistinct chatter] You got a phone call in the office. Okay. Uh... Mrs. Egan knows all about hamsters. She's gonna help you figure outif this is a boy or a girl. -[children screaming] -Look at here. [indistinct chatter] Thank you. Hello. [man] Is this Mrs. Paul Goodwin? -Yes. -Formerly Ann Lombard. Yes. [man] Once called Ana Ortiz? Who is this? [man] I have a message for you from Mr. Wanamaker. He says, "The Dancer is locked in the candy store and only you have the key." Repeat. [man] "The dancer is locked in the candy store, and only you have the key." This is off the record, Annie. -It's up to you. -[line disconnects] [indistinct chatter] Why aren't you talking? I'm thinking. About what? About you and I watching TV after school until your mom gets home. Can we watch The Three Stooges? I'd prefer Sesame Street. I prefer The Three Stooges. Watch it, buddy. [Scott] Where are we going? [Annie] I have to make a phone call. [horn honking] -[siren wailing in distant] -[continues honking] [clears throat] I'd like to speak to Rodolfo Villegas. This is Christine Michelson calling. If you don't know who he is,why do you wanna know who I am? [speaks Spanish] [indistinct chattering] [indistinct chatter] Thank you. You know, though, if you delete down one word from the clause,it changes the meaning entirely. Well, exactly and then we lay it into subparagraph 6AA, and Perkins not only ends up getting his points, but his perks are carved in stone. [man] But what about force majeure? Well, I've built in a nice little penalty clause that's gonna end up costingthem more than they'd be saving. Ann, Ann. What has more calories? Whole wheat or rye? I don't know. I keep telling you,the diet only takes you halfway. It's the exercise that locks it in. -Well, I know that. -[woman 1] You should join this great health club I found in Encino. They have the new low impact aerobics. [woman 2]How much is the membership fee? It's terrific. Let me tell you that. It's 500 the first month and second month... [indistinct chatter] [man] Oh, hi. [indistinct chatter continues] [buttons click] [telephone ringing] -[Rebecca] Hello. -[Annie] Hi, it's me. Ann, I knew it was you. The old ESP is still working. How are you? Fine. Everything's fine. I do have a little problem. I was-- -Which only I can help you with.-[Annie] Of course and who else? -What do you need? -Time and privacy. I've got some out-of-town business -I need to take care of. -I knew it. -I knew this would happen. -[Annie] Becky. You tried to lead a normal lifeand you were bored to death. You're dumping old, pompous Paul. Rebecca, I don't wanna hear another word of this. Paul is my husband. Now, if you can't be a decent sister-in-law... -Annie, I'm sorry. -[Annie] It's okay. Now, are you gonna help me or not? -Of course I'm gonna help you. -[Annie] Okay, listen. If you don't hear from me tomorrow, call the house on Saturday at noon, my time, so, you'll be sure to get Paul... -do you understand? -Yes. [Annie] Okay. Um. Tell him that you've broken your leg and you need from me -to stay with you for a week. -[Rebecca] A week? That's an awful long time for Paul to play bachelor. -He'll try to call you here. -I know. You-- You'll just have to put him off. [Rebecca] I don't know about that. Brother-in-law and I don't exactly have a lot to talk about. I think you'll figure it out. Listen, I can't talk. Wait, wait. You didn't tell me what you're doing. I owe somebody a favor. It's nothing to worry about. I'll call you again from Miami,uh, and thanks. I knew I could count on you. You know you could count on who? Um... Harriet Thorson. She's helping me with PTA next week. Oh. Well, why didn't you use the phone in my office? Don't you leave it locked all the time? [sighs] Rodolfo Villegas, por favor. [speaks Spanish] ...Christina Michelson. Rudy! [chuckles] Yes, yes, a very long time. Uh... Listen, I need to speak to you without ears. Go to a payphone and call me at... -[horn honking] -[talks indistinctly] -[phone rings] -Oh, excuse me. -Weird. -Hello. [chuckles] Rudy. Ol' pirate, how are you? [chuckles] Um... It's business. I wanna go south. Well, I'd rather not say. Uh-- But it's not a freebie, Rudy. I've got cash. How long will it take you to set it up? Okay, I'll be down there on the fifth. Now, where should I meet you? Thanks. See you then. [indistinct chatter] [man] Go on. [man] Go on. [indistinct chatter] -[breathes heavily] Hi. -Hi. [chuckles] -Have you been running again? -Yeah. Well, I figured if you're gonna be out here every afternoon, I might as wellget healthy too. Come on. -[grunts] Oh, no. -[grunts] You're-- You're not gonna get muscles, are you? -Yes. -Much better, Mrs. Goodwin. -Thank you. -But you're still keeping your arms too far out of the water. [Annie pants] Hey, is that a bullet scar? -[Paul] Hey, hey, hey. -[Annie] Yeah. Bullet scar? Come on. She fell on a ski pole, okay? She's a little klutzy but she's cute. -[chuckles] See you tomorrow. -All right. -[exhales] -So... Mighty mouth called. -Are you referring to my sister?-Yeah. She was so sweet and everything,I knew she wanted something. -And? -And she broke her leg. -Oh, no. -Look, how? I don't know. Poor baby. [exhales] She wants you to go to Philadelphia and take care of her. For how long? A whole week. [sighs] -So, you're gonna go? -Yeah, of course. -What about school? -I'll get that substitute -the kids love. -Well... What about me? I can arrange that. Look, I'll take a day off before I leave and I'll get foodin the refrigerator, get clothes in the laundry, clothes out of the cleaners, and... I have someone to take Scott to school. Just answer me one question. Does your going up there... cancel out her coming down here this year? If that what it takes. All right. Okay. See, now this might not be so bad after all. [locks door] [suspenseful music playing] -[gunshots] -[car engine revs] [gunshots] [gunshots] [indistinct chatter] [men speaking Spanish] [men speaking Spanish] [screams, pants] -[indistinct chatter] -[pants] [speaking Spanish] -[gunshots] -[Annie screams] -[plane engine revs] -[man speaking Spanish] -No, Dancer, get out of here! -[gunshots] -[Vic] Shut up and hang on! -[Annie] No. -[Annie grunts] No. -[gunshots continue] -[Vic speaking Spanish] -[gunshots] [plane engine revs] -[gunshots] -[men shouting in Spanish] -[Annie breathes sharply] -[plane whirring] You, idiot. [groans] -We should both be dead. -Well... since we're not, you should say thanks. [pants] Thanks. -[pants]-It's all right. You owe me one. It's okay. [plane whirring] You sure you don't want me to go to the airport -with you? -I'm sure, thanks. Don't forget to pay Hilde on Friday. The check is on top of the refrigerator. Okay. All right. Okay. -Bye-bye. -[Annie] Bye-bye. -Call me. -I will. Okay, and did your mother tell you that Mrs. Hughes is gonna starttaking you to school tomorrow? -Okay? -Mm-hmm. Okay. Give me a big hug? -[grunts] Bye-bye. -Bye! -[car engine revving] -[car door shuts] [car engine starts] [horn honking] [man over stereo] Temperature here in Los Angeles is a comfortable 72 degrees. And now-- [music starts playing over stereo] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [both speaking Spanish] Hola, chica. -[chuckles]-You're over an hour late. Yes, well, I've been having a drink with a very simpatico gentleman. -Oh.-He tells me that he just spent a miserable week finding an acceptable housing for three very high-ranking Soviet officers. Well, that's one for your side. [Vic] Yeah, terrific. Isn't that terrific? Well, let's get back to my sidefor a while, huh? [indistinct chatter] Annie... we've got four reports. There hasn't been a change in the number of Russians on this island in six months. I still say we should go afterLuis Malarin. If anybody knows about new Russian troops camping out in the jungle, it's him. Forget it. Hey, Annie. When are you gonna start wh-- [speaking Spanish] -[both chuckle] -[speaking Spanish] [indistinct chatter] Annie... we could be facing... another missile crisis here. And I'd appreciate a little cooperation. [indistinct chatter] And you chose right. Malarin is the obvious target. He's closer to Fidel than anybody and... he's accessible. Accessible? I've researched this guy. He's got no wife, no steady girlfriend, no entourage at all. [indistinct chatter] This is not a man who lets people get close. Annie, baby... we've got faith in you. Should've been a pimp, Cardona. I was. [indistinct chatter] [speaking Spanish] [breathes heavily, speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] Señorita... Ana. Ana Ortiz. [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [drink pouring] [speaking Spanish] [ice cubes clattering] Gracias. [speaking Spanish] Si. [speaking Spanish] [door shuts] [sighs] [crickets chirping] [Annie] Vic, it's not gonna work. [Vic laughing] What's not gonna work? It's working. [Annie] I say we look for another way. What are you talking about? -[chuckles] -[indistinct chatter] I just spent 24 hours with the man. -Yeah. -The only thing I picked up on was that his commitment to communism seems a little anemic. And I'm not even sure about that. Okay, so, he's a hard case. We knew that going in. Ah, it's just gonna take a little time, that's all. No, I don't have any more time for this. [Vic exhales sharply] Annie, you're telling me something but I can't break the code here. I'm in jeopardy here. We are all in jeopardy here. [indistinct chatter] Where are you going? What-- -[speaking Spanish] -Mm-hmm. [speaking Spanish] [door closes] [music playing] [both exhale sharply] Hey, I don't understand it. I told you before, this relationship is just not conducive to the extraction of information. [scoffs] Now, what the hell does that supposed to mean? Look deep into my eyes and try to concentrate. Malarin and Iwill never discuss the presence of a newly arrived Soviet combat brigade because Malarin and I never discuss anything. Sex. Dancer, I'm talking about sex. So? [indistinct chatter] The man turns me on. -That's really boring, Annie. -Well, I'm sorry, Vic, but things like this happen and you know that. There's nothing I can do now except walk away. [sighs] But is this mutual? I think so. -You think so? -Yes, it's mutual. Hey! Well, then it's okay, then. Look, Annie, just hang around for a while, huh? We got maybe two weeks before this job goes sour. Maybe something will happen. Something's gonna happen, all right? -I'm gonna blow my cover. -Uh. This mission doesn't have a high enough priority for me to take a chance like that. I'm off this. Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute, kid. I'm control on this job, I set the priorities. Now, you just go back to Malarin. And you stay there till I tell you to leave. [Vic sighs] -[indistinct chatter] -[exhales softly] Look. I'm sorry, Annie. Now, this is our best and maybe our only bet. Annie... I need winners real bad. [music playing] [airplane whooshing] [indistinct chatter] [man] Thank you very much. -Señor Villegas? -Ah, yes, Mrs. Michelson. I have the book you ordered. I'm sorry it took so long. This way please. -[speaking Spanish, laughs] -[Annie] Amigo, I missed you. How good it is to see you again. -Yes. -And you are a blonde. Can I ask which is the real you? The Christine you remember, but if you'll give me an hour in your kitchen sink, you'll have her right back. But she's already here. Apart from the hair, you look exactly the same. Liar! I'm eight years older and so are you. Tell me everything. Where are you now? Who are you? You're looking at a bona fide wife and schoolteacher of Los Angeles, California. [Rudy chuckles] -This new life agrees with you?-Yes, I'm content. -And you? -I sell books. [chuckles] -Am I set for tonight? -Oh, yeah. Yes. [Rudy] I don't do much of this sort of thing anymore. But I'm always at the service of all friends. [zipper opens] These are fine. How about the boat? [Rudy] Ready to go. Do you still keep up on the political soap opera -down there? -Oh, yeah. What do you want to know? Is Luis Malarin still sitting at Fidel's right hand? Yes. And most of the others have been, shall we say... replaced? But not Malarin. Mind if I make a long-distance call? Please, please. Oh, I have a suitcase at the airport. It's under the name of Ellen Fitzpatrick, -can you hold on to it for me? -Of course. [woman speaking over PA indistinctly] [telephone buzzes] Yes, Darleen? [Darleen] There's a call from Mrs. Goodwin on line one. Oh, thanks. -Hi. How was your flight? -No complains. You don't sound too good. Did something go wrong at the Perkins' meeting? Oh, boy! No. No, not much. The whole thing just fell apart is all. [inhales] Well, they must've found sub-paragraph 6AA. Uh... Yeah. Yeah, they did. I guess I should've buried it a little deeper. -Look, so, how's Becky? -[Annie] Totally immobilized, but she sends her love. Yeah? Huh. Okay. Well, tell her to get better as soon as possible. Yeah. [chuckles] Um... Becky's calling me now. She's been living on Twinkies for two days, I'm gonna go buy her some real food. Yeah, okay. I'll talk to you soon. -I love you. -Me too. Paul don't worry about Perkins.I know you'll turn it around. Bye. Oh. [chuckles] I don't need that. May I ask, uh... I mean, if you no longer work for them-- This is personal, not official.Something for old times. Old times can be very dangerous. They get people killed. Christine the cautious. Christine the wife and the schoolteacher. [inhales deeply] You're right. I'm rusty. But if I get picked up, it's gonna be easier for them to believe my story if I'm not carrying a gun. [both sigh] [ominous music playing] [boat engine revving] [pants] [man speaking Spanish over TV] [woman speaking Spanish over TV] [both speaking Spanish over TV] [woman speaking Spanish over TV] [woman speaking Spanish over TV] [knock on door] [man speaking Spanish over TV] Si? Entrar. [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] Si. [TV playing indistinctly] Make it brief and in English. [Abel] Yes, sir. I understand. I was just at a party. To which we're invited by the way. -[Malarin] Mm-hmm. -Our friends from the East -worry about you. -I worry about our friends from the East. Well, one friend told me they are thinking of sending a combat battalion here. -A brigade actually. -[TV playing indistinctly] [Malarin] Rifle, tank, artillery battalions, surface support units, nearly 3000 men. [Abel] Then it's true. They are coming. [Malarin] They are already here. What does it mean? Why are they here? Perhaps, they wanna work on their terms. Oh, come on, a bid. Abel, you take these things too seriously. The Soviets say they want to send the brigade. Fidel says if you wish to forget advice, the Americans find out. President Carter makes an angry speech, the Marines in Guantanamo go on alert. -The Soviets claim innocence...-[Adel sighs] ...Fidel shrugs, the brigade goes home, -everyone's happy. -Everyone. -Well, the Soviets? -On the contrary. The Soviets are only happy when they're unhappy. A very perverse people. You honor me with your confidence, Luis. [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] Rojas. Rojas. [speaking Spanish] [Vic] Move it! Where are you taking us? You know where, Comandante. Your presence on this trip is purely coincidental. I'm really sorry, babe. One of Lucho's Miami contacts turned up double -and made all of us. -[Annie] It's okay. -I got it. -[Vic] You got it? -[Annie] Yes. -[laughs hysterically] Winners, damn it! Winners! [man] What are you yelling about? We're not winners till we get on that plane. [Vic] Shut up and pull over. [Vic] All right, Comandante. This is where you get out. -Unless you wanna go to Miami. -I've been to Miami. Oh. [Vic] Won't be a long wait. Probably catch a ride from the guys chasing us. -[car door shuts] -[tires screeching] Are we leaving anything behind? Let's not get melodramatic. [chuckles] All right. That's my Annie. -[Annie panting] -[water splashing] [pants] [man speaking Spanish] [breathes heavily] [men speaking Spanish] [pants] [pants] [continues panting] [birds chirping] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [crowd chattering indistinctly] [indistinct chatter] [sad music playing] [telephone ringing] [ringing continues] -Hello. -[Paul over phone] Finally! I've been calling for hours. Why are you answering the phone? I thought you were strung up in bed. I am, I mean, I was. Ann left the telephone too far from the bed and when it kept ringing, I rolled out of bed and crawled over to it. [Paul] Oh. So, where is Ann? Uh... She went to the store to rent some movies. Good. Well, just have her call me the minute -she gets back, all right? -[Rebecca] Is something wrong? [chuckles] No, no! Something is great. I just saved this contract I was sure was dead. Congratulations. You wanna tell me about it? No. I mean, thanks for your interest but it's just very complicated. Just have Ann call me when she gets back, all right? -Paul? -[Paul] Bye. [hisses in frustration] Whoops. [sighs] -[Malarin speaking Spanish] -[Annie] Comandante. [engine starts revving] [speaking Spanish] [both speaking Spanish] Your assumption that I wanted you arrested is astonishing... and insulting. Not an assumption, Luis. A gamble. Besides, from where I'm standing, a Cuban jail doesn't look so bad. I'm in desperate trouble with my own people. It's-- it's extremely complicated but the only one that can help me with them is here... in one of your jails. I think I'll have you shot. It's Vic Pena. You're much more convincing in Spanish. Luis, I've got to see him. Your weak Pena hasn't been in Cuba since 1979. I'm begging you. We don't have him. But they told me he was here. Who told you? The CIA. Well, there's a reliable source. You're telling me the truth, aren't you? You don't have him? We don't have him. -Oh, my God. -[glasses clinking] Luis, I'm sorry... but you're right. I've been lied to,but I don't know what it means. If you don't have the Dancer, then what am I doing in Cuba? -The vaudeville act continues. -Listen to me! Something is very wrong here. I'm not even in it anymore. I haven't been for years. But they called me, and they usedthe highest priority name I know to activate me, they said thatVic Pena was in Prison in Cuba, and I was the only one who had the key, I thought they met you. I'm sorry. I couldn't ignore it. Vic saved my life. Why should I believe anything you say? Oh, come on! It was years ago, I was just doing my job! Your job was to make me betray my country. We were just countering Russians. [sobs] -[gasps]-I think I'll shoot you myself. You'd never hurt me. And you didn't come back to saveVic Pena's life. -You came back to me. -[gasps] [both breathe sharply] I used to dream about you. We're always in a car. [exhales] You do your best work in cars. It's an American specialty, now, they teach it to us in high school. [both chuckle] Why did you quit? -[sighs] I wanted to be normal.-Mm-hmm. Tired of subverting foreign governments? [chuckles softly] Yeah, something like that. It's not important. Not many things are anymore. -What about you? -What? What happened to all that revolutionary fervor? Oh, the revolution was 28 years ago. It's a long time to keep celebrating. I'm sorry. Why don't you stay? [Annie sighs] Luis, I-- I'm married. Part of the desire of being normal, huh? Yes. Your husband doesn't know, does he? [sighs] Do you realize that whoever brought you here is... out there looking for you? Yes. I can get you on to a plane to Mexico. It'll take a few days to arrange that. -[both chuckle softly] -Thank you. Why do you leave me? [exhales sharply] I have to. But I'm not sure I can. [birds chirping] [telephone ringing] -Diga. -[Annie] Luis? -Si? -Luis, I've figured it out. It's not me they're after, it's you. [knock on door] Comandante. [speaking Spanish] Stupid. [military vehicles approaching] [officers chattering over radio] [chattering continues] [officers speaking Spanish] [pants] -[grunts] -[clapping] [shushes] [crowd chattering indistinctly in Spanish] [crowd chanting in Spanish] [passengers singing in Spanish] [singing continues] [singing in Spanish] [singing continues] [passengers applauding] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [Lucho] I still say you should go after Luis Malarin. If anybody knows about new Russian troops camping out in the jungle, it's him. Old times can be very dangerous. They get people killed. Annie... I need winners real bad. [music intensifies] [indistinct chattering in Spanish] [indistinct chattering in Spanish] [indistinct chattering in Spanish] [bus engine revving] -[bus idling] -[speaks indistinctly] [Annie] Espere! [distant dog barking] [crickets chirping] [speaking Spanish] [chair creaking] [vehicle approaching] [gate opens] [knocking on door] [both speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [bottle cracks open] [speaking Spanish] [all speaking Spanish] [exhales] [boy speaking Spanish] [screams] Buenos dias, Dancer, I've come to rescue you. -[breathes heavily] Annie. -Look at this. Never thought I'd hold one of these again. -And now... -[gun cocks] ...I'll bet I even remember how to use it. Annie, please. [breathes heavily] -Just let me explain. -It's gonna be a long story. My visa's just about up. -Please. -Go on! [exhales sharply] I'm sorry. God, I'm sorry, but we had to get Malarin. And you were the only way we knew. He has been arrested. [Vic] Yeah. Let me guess... consorting with a known enemy agent. Yeah. Annie, I told 'em. I told 'em they'd be putting youin a hell of a spot but... you know how they are. They don't care. You know, when they want something, nobody counts for spit. Annie, please, huh? Look, you made it out. You know, that was me. [exhales sharply] I didn't tell 'em it had workeduntil Malarin left the house, you know. Gave you a chance to escape. [chuckles] And you did. You did just that. [chuckles] Man... you still got it there, kid. Well, baby... Baby, what do you want me to say, huh? [whimpers]All right, they used you, okay? Annie, they use me. They use everybody. [Annie] Who's they, Vic? Hmm? What? Well, you know, the-- the company. You bastard! You used me. [breathes sharply] I was here last night, Vic. A Russian is a Russian and I know one when I see one. Oh, Vic. How long you've been playing for the B team? [chuckles] No! Annie... [exhales sharply] ...just want a cigarette, that's all. Huh? [breathes sharply] I'm with no team now. It's just the bucks. My dancing days are over. Why the frame on Malarin? You couldn't find anyone more loyal. Yeah, yeah, to Fidel but not to the Russians. He hates their guts. Everybody knows that. It's no big secret. Why is he such a threat all of a sudden? It's that spiel Castro's been giving Latin America. You know, the one about skipping out on their debts to the Western banks. The Comrades are nervous. Anything Fidel's thinking ontaking the hike on the billions he owes them. What's that gotta do with Malarin? He thinks he's behind it. They know he's the reason why Fidel didn't go to Chaneco's funeral. What happens to him now? [Vic] He's a dead man. Okay. Okay? [scoffs] I mean, that's it? You know, I've spent the last several days of my life being pretty stupid. But you haven't been so bright yourself. Didn't it ever occur to you that Malarin might have resale value? -Huh? -I'm betting my life that our side-- No. That my side... will be willing to pay you morefor Malarin alive... than the Russians did for him dead. -You may have a point. -Do they know you've turned? -[Vic] I don't think so. -[exhales sharply] Knowing them I believe it. Okay. You plug yourself into the network. You tell them that the Dancer and Ana Ortiz can liberate Luis Malarin from the Russians for a fee. -[breathes sharply] -And you name your price. My price? Come on, you're not going for a piece of this? When they agree. You use your connections here, you provide me with the means to get Malarin out, and I'll handle the rest. [chuckles confusingly] You know, in all these U-turns you're making, I got a little lost. Just what is it you're trying to do? Get me out of Cuba alive. All right. [chuckles] Why is that I get the impressionit's Malarin you're trying to get out of Cuba alive. Come on, Dancer. -Put your tap shoes on. -[chuckles softly] Malarin is my insurance against you. The only way I'm gonna get out of here is if I can give you something more profitable than me. [Vic exhales] [scoffs] That's a low blow. Why, Vic? -You haven't told me that part.-[chuckles] Oh, Annie. I was always in it for the game. Didn't you know that? How long do you figure to make the arrangements? -[Vic] Well, a couple of days. -No, one day. Malarin can have that much time left. All right, one day, if they buy. [Annie] They'll buy. I'll see you tomorrow at noon. [speaks Spanish] Dancer... after all these years, what madeyou think your plan would work? 'Cause I knew Malarin. Do you know that in the last eight years, he's worked his way through practically every woman in the government... and half the ones in the party apparatus... none of them lasted a month. Ann, 'cause I knew you... you owed me, Annie. And you always pay your debts. [door opens] -[door shuts] -[sighs in relief] Hi, is this the office whereRebecca Lombard works please? Uh... Yes. This is Paul Goodwin.I'm her brother-in-law. Yeah, Ann's husband, that's right. Look, I'm really worried. I've been calling Becky's apartment most of the day with no answer and I just wantedif you could tell me is something wrong or is there some number that I can-- The supply room? No, I mean, what do you mean she's in the supply room? You mean, she's at work? [sighs] Okay, let me ask you a question. Does she have a broken leg? No. [sighs] Uh... No. I'll call her. Thank you very much. Darleen? [doorbell dinging] [exhales sharply] How's the leg? [door closes] Okay, so, you don't have a broken leg and Ana is not here and she never has been, by the look of things, so, I wanna know right now where she is and what this is all about? She's doing something for you, that's it, right? You're in some sort of a jam and she's doing something that I wouldn't approve of to save your rear end. It has nothing to do with me. Look, little sister, I know where you stand but you better stay out of my way. I'm not in your way, Ann is. If she'd wanted you to know where she was going, she would've told you. Obviously, you're not as close as you thought you were. -Oh, cheap shot. -Cheap target. Rebecca! -What is going on? -I can't tell you. -Where is my wife? -I can't tell you! [sighs sharply] [Rebecca] What are you doing? Well, you see, I'm going to call the police because as far as I'm concerned,my wife just became a missing-- -No, you will ruin everything. -What? What will I ruin? She went to Miami. I think it has something to do with her old job for the government. No, Ann never worked for the government. Have it your way. She never worked for the government. Okay, okay. If she worked for the government, why-- why didn't she tell me? I have nothing more to say. You'll have to ask her that. It's something embarrassing, right? Okay. What could she be? Senate page? An IRS agent? Secret agent? Lob-- That's it. A secret agent? Ann's a spy? I don't believe this. Oh, God. Now, what are you doing? I'm going to Miami to find my wife. [Rebecca] Oh, that's real smart.What do you think she did, -left a trail of breadcrumbs? -I'll find her. [sighs] All you're gonna do is get her into trouble. She wasn't supposed to tell anybody anything ever. And she didn't, did she? She didn't tell me. [sighs] It's Wardell. I'm at LAX. No, no. There's no confirmationshe's gone south, but she's not here. She's not where she told the neighbor she was going and that's good enough for me. I say the Dancer's offeris kosher, we should move on it. No. No, no, there's no husband but we're looking for him. [indistinct announcement over PA] Listen, you're not paying attention. This merchandise is too valuableto play it cautious. Make the damn deal. [indistinct chatter] [Annie speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [indistinct chatter] Ah! Where you've been? Cutting cane for the revolution. [chuckles] Damn it, Annie. You always were the best hideout artist in the business. -Did they buy him? -Oh, yeah. You were right. He made a very nice deal. -Where is he? -In a hospital. I got him on quarantine like he had Bubonic plague or something. Haven't seen anything in the papers. No, no, no. No links. His guards probably don't even know who they're guarding. What have you got for me? A pass into his room and two keys. [sighs] I wonder who had voted Rudy's old doc? And I wonder what carparked in front of the hospital. Don't tell me the same old junker? [Vic] Oh, yeah. Wonderful. You gotta handle the rest. Is Julio Nunez stillin the medical supply business? In Miami. He got out with the Marielitos. But his cousin is doing little black market thing here, on what Julio can smuggle into him. Okay. -Coming out with this? -[Vic] Uh-uh! Oh, the only trip I'm making is to the Bahamas. You deliver in Miami, I collect in Nassau. [Annie] Then what? Greener pastures. How much time you think you got, Dancer? [indistinct chatter] See you, Annie. [woman over PA] The White Zone is for loading and unloading for passengers only. -[Wardell] Mr. Goodwin? -Yes? I'd like to talk to you for a moment. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. -I told you. Now, what do you think you're doing? And let me see that identification again please? Mr. Goodwin, what is your wife doing in Cuba? Cuba? She's in Cuba? I don't know. But you know more than you should, don't you? I just know Ann used to work for you people. Our little Annie's got a big mouth. -She's retired. -So, I've noticed. -Let's go. -Now, look. Now, look, pal. You better tell me what's going on? Right now! -Or I'm gonna call the cops. -No, you're not. What you're going to do is get into this car and go to a hotel room with no telephone where you and Mrs. Lombard will stay under guard till we strike it out-- No, no, no. You can't lock us up. -Watch me. -I'm-- Look-- I don't know what the hell you think you're doing. [thunder rumbling] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] -[door shuts] -[Annie] Luis. Thank God, you're not sedated. I don't know how I would have handled that. I didn't do this to you. I was used to do it... by the Dancer and your old comrades, the Russians. They finally had it with you, you had to go and I was the bait. You're finished here, you know that. -You have to get out of here. -I explained Fidel. You'll never see Fidel. They're going to kill you, Luis. My God, it feels like, I've killed you. Please come with me. [Annie whimpers] [speaking Spanish] -[speaking Spanish] -[grunts] [grunting] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] -[Malarin] Who set this up? -[Annie] Vic. It's okay. I showed him how to double his money. We sold it to the company which is a scam just to get you out of here. -I won't talk to them. -I never meant for you to. Here are the keys. Take this. -[Annie] Where are you going? -[Malarin] A different route. Longer and less comfortable. This is going too smoothly and I don't have your faith into Dancer's greed. [gasps] Oh, Vic. [sighs] I can't say you didn't earn it. The Dancer's in the trunk. He has a hole where his heart used to be. Which means they're expecting us. Yes. And which also makes me wonder,why they've let us get this far? It turned out our escape plot into an execution plot. I cannot be killed in public. Yes, but there has to be a public explanation. How about hero of the revolutionassassinated by Yankee Imperialist agent? Agent executed by vigilant army. It'll play. [indistinct chatter] [tires screech] -What are we gonna do now? -[sighs] Go for the boat. We know what's waiting for us there. If we look for another way, we'll just be giving them time to find us. And they will. We'll walk the rest of the way. [indistinct chatter] [laughter, indistinct chatter] [thud] [indistinct chatter] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [singing in Spanish] [singing, cheering] -"La Rueda." -[Malarin panting] You know, a couple of things just occurred to me. That's probably a reception committee waiting. And no gasoline. [both panting] Can you hot-wire a fishing boat? A Cuban can make anything run. [music playing] -[Malarin] Now. -[gunshot] [speaking Spanish] [boat engine revs] -[speaking Russian] -[gunshot] [gunshots continue] [groans] [speaking Spanish] -Ana, what are you doing? -[Annie] They're out there looking for us. If they find us together, -you're trapped. -We're going to Mexico. Ana! What if they don't find you? Then the drug smugglers will, or the Haitian. I'm not going to sail away and leave you adrift -in the middle of the ocean. -And I promised you I wouldn't let them get you. My promises haven't meant that much lately. Please help me keep this one. If you must... but I insist you wait until we've sighted the Florida Keys. No! It is too dangerous for you! I know it's too dangerous for me. [engine starts] Luis... tell me you forgive me. I forgive you. [music playing] [airplane whooshing] [water swashing] [man 1] Take the slack out all lines, makeup all lines. -[man 2] Aye, aye, sir. -[Annie] Thank you very much. [man 3] Take slack out of one and two as you get it. Where is Malarin? -Where is Malarin? -He's dead. All right, I'm calling NASA.Vic Pena's not gonna get a dime. Save your breath, the Dancer is dead too. What the hell happened down there? Wait a minute, Lombard. You are gonna have to tell me everything. In your dreams, Wardell. Oh. Well, I've got a little surprisefor you, back at the hotel. Your sister... and your husband. -[car engine starts] -Go. [woman] Honestly, it's a... [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [woman] Dinner? You decide... [man] Oh, oh. Oh, yeah. [woman chuckles] Okay, honey. Annie... -Annie, I'm so sorry.-It's okay. It's not your fault. -I'm responsible for everything. -Well, you got that right. [indistinct chatter] [Annie sighs] -Will you let me explain? -Ah. Please, I mean... I wouldn't miss this story for anything. My wife, the spy. So where would you like to begin? How aboutwith the two government gorillas that locked me in a hotel room for 24 hours? No, no. Let's go back a little further. How about the day we met and you told me that you were a schoolteacher,and you were into Italian food, and old Alfred Hitchcock movies, -and you read Hemingway-- -Paul! See, the thing is I believed all those lies. Six years of lies. When you told me that you loved me and that you wanted to spend the rest of your life with me. I mean, wha-- what was that? I me-- I mean, what am I? Camouflage for some dirty job you're doing somewhere? No, never. [Annie] Please... Look... [sighs] I know I deserve everything you're saying to me. But I can't stand to see you hurt like this. Just listen to me, let me try to explain. The reason that I didn't tell you about my past was because I was through with it. I didn't want any part of it to touch you. [scoffs] Oh, all right. Oh, I see. So, you were protecting me? Yeah, I thought I was. No, no, you were protecting you,you were using me. I'm sorry. No. No, no, that's not good enough. I know. Well,there's nothing that I can say that's gonna be good enough. [breathes deeply] Paul, what do you want me to do? I want you to give me my wife back. Don't you know how I wish I could do that. You wish? What do you want? I don't wanna hurt you anymore. Oh. Whoa. [exhales sharply] No, I think I know what that means. It means that I've lost you, doesn't it? No, no. Huh. It's even worse than that, it means I never had you. Don't say that. Don't even think it. You're the best thing that ever happened to me. [Wardell] Hey, Lombard? Appose your cloak and dagger out of cold storage. When you coming back to work? [Wardell laughing] Oh. You'll be back. You're a danger junkie. Just like me. And nobody kicks that habit. It kicks you. [music playing]
