Previously on "The Flash," "Arrow," and "Legends of Tomorrow"... [Dominator snarling] Since we learned of them, we've been calling them the Dominators. You can't do this alone. I don't plan to. Guys, thanks for coming. This is Kara Danvers. Supergirl. ♪ ♪ I went back in time to change the timeline. It's called Flashpoint, and now things here are different than before I left. You just erased a daughter from my life? He took it upon himself to change the timeline, and, because of it, my brother was killed. There's no amount of feeling bad that could ever make up for that. I'm having memories of a stranger, but she's not really a stranger. What if, when you interacted with your younger self in 1987, - you... - Inadvertently changed my past. You're back! Oh, it's so good to see you. I love you, Dad. Call Lyla. Tell her these Dominators aren't here peacefully. Maybe they chose us because we couldn't fight back, because none of you are meta-humans. What is their plan? [speaking alien language] The phrase loosely translates to, “We are nearing completion of the weapon.” I can't believe that you guys escaped an alien spaceship. Key words: alien spaceship. - I have questions. - They can wait. Thanks for helping me get my sister home. Yeah, man. What's our status? Nothing, since the Dominators paid their little visit - to mess with our heads. - Why would they do that? What if they were trying to pit us against each other, in order to gain intel about meta-humans? Man, I wish they would just send us an IM with a questionnaire. Well, metas pose the biggest threat to their invasion. It would make sense they'd want to get to know their enemies. By kidnapping people. Perhaps they were searching your minds for potential meta-human vulnerabilities. I think it's time we return the favor. What do you want to do? Kidnap one of them now? Ever since we fought off that one ship, they've kind of been in short supply. Actually, I know where to find one. I've been reviewing old Army footage of their first encounters with the Dominators, and I think I pegged the fight to... [computer beeps] [explosions booming] Redmond, Oregon. 1951. [soldiers groaning, gunfire] [weapons blasting, gunfire] [Dominator roars] [soldier groans] [Dominator snarls] You're suggesting we travel to 1951, abduct a Dominator, and interrogate it to determine their intentions. They kidnapped us. Seems fair. Whoa. Time travel. I'm definitely in. Okay, hold on, though. Professor Stein and Caitlin have been talking about a way to take down the Dominators. They could probably use your help. Pass. Yeah, I mean, I'm with him, mostly 'cause I just don't want to lose my geek cred, but time travel! [squeals] I could take Amaya and Mick. Do it. - Yeah! - Okay. And, uh, the new president called, which would be cool under different circumstances, but she wants to meet with us. Let's bring Ray and Sara as backup. What about me? I can do backup. Can I talk to you for a second? I don't know. I would like to minimize your involvement in this. Why? Because I'm an alien? I also happen to be your biggest weapon. You are an unknown quantity, and this is not personal. Except that's exactly how this feels. Kara, when I started living this life, it was just me. I was going up against human threats... That I could handle. Then it was meta-humans, and I can handle that. Now I learn that there are multiple Earths, and I was brainwashed aboard an alien spacecraft... I am sure that was unnerving, but I don't... I don't get unnerved. But when I go up against something new, I push back. Right or wrong, it is who I am, and it is what I do, so I'm asking for a little bit of space because I have to draw the line somewhere. I need to claw back a sense of normalcy.

Can we just keep moving this along? - This ship is... - Automatic? - Supersonic. - Hypnotic. Both: Funky fresh. Professor? It's highly unlikely we can fashion a weapon with sufficient force to overcome the Dominators. I was thinking the exact same thing, which is why I invited...

And also, yes, I wanted to get away from Barry. Ah! You realize that's insane, right? You're holding a grudge against your best friend when the world is potentially going to end. I'm sorry. My “best friend”? He only killed my brother. - He didn't kill... - Okay, you're right. He didn't literally kill my brother. What I mean to say is, he was responsible. Okay? He just needed to save his family, and in doing that, he ended up destroying mine. ♪ ♪ You know, all this time traveling, fighting aliens, this is the stuff I used to dream about as a kid. Heh. Yeah, me too. But it doesn't feel like a dream. It just feels weird. Well, exactly, and it's only gonna get weirder. So that's why we have to be able to rely on our friends. I really wish I could right now, Felicity. But he's not my friend. [Dominators growling] [energy beam whooshing] - They're taking off. - I don't get it.

Wait, you're saying Lily belongs to another timeline? That, when Barry created Flashpoint, she... Unfortunately, this is all my fault. You see, a month ago, I interacted with my younger self back in 1987 and unwittingly motivated him... Me... To sire a child. So it's because of my carelessness that this Time Aberration exists. She is not an Aberration. She is brilliant and funny and a lot like you, just a little less uptight. Please stop talking about her like this. She is not a real person. She is a real person. She's your daughter. Wait. When we finish fighting the Dominators, you're gonna go back in time and... erase her? No. I am going to restore the timeline.
