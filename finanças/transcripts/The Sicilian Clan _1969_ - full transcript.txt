"WHEN I PAINT HORSE- THIEVES, I DO NOT SAY THAT STEALING HORSES IS WRONG. THAT IS THE JUROR'S CONCERN, NOT MINE." CHEKHOV THE SICILIAN CLAN GUARD: Take your hands out of your pockets. Face me. When your last name is called, answer with your first name. - Pirozetti. - ANTOINE: Antoine. (PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) May I smoke? Go ahead. Roger Sartet? Can I take a leak? Sit down. There's been a little hitch, Sartet. Your lawyer notified us that he couldn't be here. If you want to postpone... - No, let's get it over with, Your Honor. - Very well, Sartet. My investigation is completed. In accordance with the law, I shall recapitulate my findings before transmitting them to the state prosecutor. Here's a copy of my summary. Your name is Roger Sartet. You were born October 15th, 1935, at 27 rue des Cordonniers, Nancy. You and your sister were reared by your father, a factory worker. Your attendance at school was fairly regular until the age of 11. One of your teachers, Mr. Segure, described you as "a pupil who smiled all the time and knew how to get along with others." This is the only favorable report in the entire file. Your police record begins at the age of 14. Come in. Oh, come in, inspector. Uh, this will be over in a few minutes. This long series of armed offenses, characterized by a cold- blooded brutality, culminated in the case now under consideration, the armed robbery of the Caron jewelry store. On June 15th, you went into the store alone a few minutes before closing time. On this occasion, you fired without warning and fled with jewelry valued at $150,000. Three months later, when you were tracked down by the police, you refused to surrender and fired on the police, killing officers Ponthier and Sorel. You consistently denied being responsible for this last hold- up, but ballistic evidence has conclusively established that the bullets shot in the Caron jewelry store came from the weapon with which you killed the two officers. These are the charges submitted against you. As prescribed by law, I now ask you, have you anything to add? - I maintain my statements, Your Honor. - Very well, Sartet. "Having read a transcript of the charges against me, "I adhere to my previous declarations." Sign there, please. - Checking my neck, inspector? - Not exactly. You'll forgive me if I get you out of bed at dawn one of these days. LE GOFF: There is no need to apologize. I'll be there. - Thank you, Your Honor. - The Perez file, Your Honor. Huh. I'd given up hope of getting it. No, thanks. I haven't smoked for exactly 13 days and six hours precisely. - Don't you miss it? - Sure I do. See? It's not the same thing, but it helps. Okay, go. (TRUCK RATTLING) (DRILL BUZZING) (RATTLING CONTINUES) (BUZZING) (CLATTERING) (BUZZING) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) Let's go! What are you waiting for? (CAR HORNS HONKING) Your brother's out. - Okay. - Sir. How will I hear from him? He'll contact you, but with him, no news is good news. (SIGHS) Handy gadget. Just like a can of sardines. I'm very sorry, sir. Very sorry? You know what it cost us the last time? Two men. And next time, it may be one of these two here, or maybe me. You'll figure that's what we're paid for. So why should you worry? Well, I'll give you something to worry about. Finding a new job. Did I ask you for anything? He's trying to quit smoking. It's driving him crazy. - So now I know. - He'd be better off smoking. Vittorio MANALESE & Son ELECTRONIC GAMES Thanks. How come you picked us to get you out? I worked with Aldo before. I liked his style. Here. Ought to be worth... Don't worry. We'll find that out right away. Not a bad idea to hide your loot. (IN ITALIAN) And so? It's worth a little more than you thought. It should bring you 145 million lire. - When can you wrap it up? - A couple of days. I've got a buyer in Milan. What do you want me to do with the money? You still buying land in Sicily? Yeah, I've got options for all this land here. Look, borders on what I already have. It will make around 12,500 acres. - You planning to retire there? - Sure. (SNICKERS) You will be bored to death down there. I was nine when I left Sicily. So when I go back, I'll be fawned over by all those people who knew me when I was begging on the docks. That'll be quite a show. And my parents are buried there. In the most beautiful grave in the country. You're all the same. In America, a merchant buried his father in a platinum coffin. Better to leave the money for the living. - Who are you? Where do you fit in? - l'm Aldo's wife. Aldo and I live here. We moved downstairs with my father- in- law for a few days. For as long as you're here. You'll find everything you need here in the refrigerator. The bathroom is here. I'll change the sheets for you. (SIGHS) (IN ITALIAN) My friend Turi Lo Cascio. The family. My oldest boy, Aldo. - Hello. - VITTORIO: Sergio, my youngest. My daughter, Theresa. - How do you do? - And her husband, Luigi. - Hi, Grandpa. - VITTORIO: My grandson. And you know my wife, Maria. - How are you? - TURI: Fine, thank you. VITTORIO: Aldo's wife, Jeanne. She's French. (IN FRENCH) Hello. (IN ITALIAN) Sit down. How's it going? - All's fine. - (CHUCKLES) Roberto. (LOW GRUNT) Okay. (IN FRENCH) Cheese. Aldo, you shouldn't let her dress like that. I'll see you. Beer, please. - Should I get somebody to take my place? - No... Not if you'll cooperate. Then I'd better get somebody. Why? You got something on your conscience? What do you take me for? If you've come about my brother, I read the papers like everybody else. That's all I know. So I can't tell you anything. I didn't ask you anything. MONIQUE: Then what do you want? I just want to tell you something. You see this phone, the one in the booth, the one at your place. They're all tapped. You'll be followed, day and night. And if you try to call from any place else, we'll be there asking who it is. - And we'll check it out on the spot. - You're wasting your time. He won't try to call me. Maybe not, but if he does, all I want to hear is, "Monique Sartet isn't here." Or "Monique Sartet doesn't work here anymore." If you say anything else, I'm afraid you'll be in trouble, and I won't be able to help you. I don't understand. Generally, you watch people without telling them. I'm doing it backwards. I tell people and then I watch them. I don't want you to be dragged down with him. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Well... Now we just wait. You think Sartet will try to call her? Yes, and when he can't reach her, he'll go to see her. Or at least I hope so. And when he does, you tigers better hang on to him. May I talk to Monique Sartet, please? What time does she come back to work? But she's still working there, isn't she? Will she be on tonight? Hello? Hello! (GASPS) - Hello. - Hello. I brought you some groceries. Thank you. That wasn't very smart, going outside like that. They wouldn't like it downstairs. Go tell them. But I bet you won't. No? Why not? SARTET: That's Why. You know I don't need any of that. So why do you think I came? Curiosity. You've got a killer in the house, and you want a closer look at him. Because the crowd downstairs never shoots anybody, huh? Maybe that's more intelligent and harder, too. (SNICKERS) The Manalese clan has all the answers, don't they? Don't ask me about the Manalese clan. I'm the only one who's not Sicilian. (SIGHS) How does it feel when you shoot somebody? See? (SNICKERS) You are interested. All right, I'll tell you. It makes a big bang. And when he falls right there in front of you, - what does it do to you? - Nothing. It's over so fast. You know what started me shooting? Nobody took me seriously, even with a gun in my hand. I guess I didn't have the face for the business. It's as simple as that. Now beat it! I haven't had a woman in two years. (DOOR SLAMS) (INAUDIBLE) - Where is he? - Room 36. That's him? Sure is. He was in such a hurry he didn't even wait for his change. You know the girl? Her name is Simone. A regular. - Call her room. - But... Go ahead. Ask them if they want a drink. (RINGING) Hello? I don't know, Albert. I'll ask him. You want something to drink? Hmm... Champagne. You got any good champagne? All right, send up a bottle. Okay, thanks, Albert. - That's for the champagne... - Thanks. ...and that's for you. Huh. If only they were all like you. Enjoy it while it lasts. I never paid for it before. Hey, you didn't mind about the champagne, did you? No, no. It's okay. I don't know what's come over Albert. He never pushed drinks before. SIMONE: What's happening? (WOMAN SCREAMING) Jean- Marie Ballard. Antoine Le Coeur. Jojo Benini. Nicolas Ramsky. That's all? Yes, sir. They were five in the cell. So these four plus Sartet is right. LE GOFF: Okay, let's go. Your name, last name and occupation. - Jean- Marie Ballard, electronics engineer. - How long have you been in? - Three months. - What for? What happened? I was in Rome setting up the alarm system for a jewelry show. You know, the French jeweler's exposition at the Villa Borghese. The display is worth millions. Anyway, we worked for almost a month. I finished sooner than I thought I would. I came home unexpectedly. I wanted to surprise my wife. And she was... I caught her in bed with another man. I lost my head. There was a gun in the drawer. I grabbed it and fired. You were in the same cell as Sartet. How did you get along with him? Well? BALLARD: He was the nicest of the lot. And the only one with any manners. SARTET: Well, that's it. The whole plan for the security system of the jewelry show at the Villa Borghese. Drawn by the guy that installed it. Pretty sloppy work for an engineer. He was on his hands and knees in the cell. Didn't it seem funny that this guy would spill his guts to you like that? Not under the circumstances. This guy never even saw a jail before. Jealous husband, he was a wreck. Ready to cry on the shoulder of the first guy that would listen to him. I didn't have to pump him, just let it flow out. And every day he told me a little more. You wanna know what I think, it's the greatest deal of the century. Yeah, but we don't want any killing. That's something you can't be sure of ahead of time. We wanna be sure. That's why we're talking about it. Listen, if you want candy, go rob some old lady's candy store. - Is that for my benefit? - VITTORIO: Sergio. Well, personally, I trust the engineer. He sounds okay to me. You're the one I don't trust. - Me? - Yeah, you. All your brain's below your belt. You almost got us all in cold storage last night playing games in a whorehouse. Would you rather have had me do it here? At 35, the question is that simple. Well, at 65, it's even simpler. Right now, I got a terrific urge not to touch your job. I can't argue with a terrific urge. I'll take my idea elsewhere. Nobody's stopping you. Who's gonna buy your $50 million worth of ice? $50 million worth of stones at half price, I'll find someone. Oh, yeah? You know many fences who'll put out five million or even two in cash? - Can you name one? - And you... Can you? Yeah, I can. (SIGHS) What's your proposition? You keep out of it until we're ready. Stay in the apartment. You can't be trusted outdoors alone. All right, but remember one thing. Nobody cuts me out of a deal. Especially when I brought it in. (DOOR SLAMS) Operator, I want New York. Person- to- person for Mr. Tony Nicosia. N- I- C- O- S- I- A. New York City, 957- 5000. (IN ITALIAN) Vittorio, don't you have enough yet with all the land you've bought? Do you still want more and more? You said that after that man was safe, you'd quit the business and we'd go back to the old country to end our days. - Are you in such a hurry to die? - (SIGHS) (PHONE RINGING) (IN ENGLISH) Hello? Yeah, yeah. I want to speak to Mr. Tony Nicosia. Vittorio Manalese. Manalese, that's right. (IN ITALIAN) Hello, Tony? It's Vittorio. I hope I didn't wake you up. (IN FRENCH) It's 3:00 a.m. over there? Why can't you have the same time as everybody else? No, it's not business this time. I was gonna suggest a vacation. VITTORIO: How about a little pilgrimage to Rome, just us two? There's no hurry, in two or three days. When was the last time we saw each other? No, that's 37 years. Cable me your arrival time at Rome. I'll meet you at the airport. You'll recognize me easy. I haven't changed a bit. (INAUDIBLE) - Vittorio! - Antonio! (IN ITALIAN) So you think you didn't change a bit, huh? - You bet. - (BOTH LAUGH) LUXURY FRENCH JEWELRY EXHIBITION ROME ANTONIO: Holy Mother. - (lN FRENCH) Speak French. - (lN FRENCH) Yes, you're right. Felt bug. Local alarm. Electric eye in the window base. Local alarm. ANTONIO: Detecting mike. Shock detector. Everything's exactly like in the plans. Yes, everything's exactly like in the plans, except for one thing. Look up there. VITTORIO: What's that? I'll explain it to you later. As soon as they switch on their alarm system, all hell is gonna break loose. On account of your watch? What do you think, I sacrificed a good watch for nothing? (WATCH TICKING) (ALARM RINGING) (RINGING CONTINUES) I knew about all the systems, but this is new to me. - American, huh? - What else? Wonderful. And how does it work, your system? It's based on shortwaves. You lift a finger, nod your head, the hands of a watch, anything moving interferes with the shortwave, see? And it makes the alarm go off. (SIRENS WAILING) That kills this. I suppose it's all hooked up to the police. That wasn't in the plan. We should've known before. Come on, old pal, it's getting you down. Anyhow, it's really great to see you again. (KIDS EXCLAIMING) (IN ITALIAN) Stick 'em up! Hey, never like that. - Like this, you see? - Understand? (CHUCKLES) How old is your grandson, Vittorio? - He'll soon be seven. And yours? - Nine and a half. Well, maybe the kids can get something out of this trip even if we don't. (TOY PLANE WHIRRING) Say, Tony. (IN FRENCH) Did you know that in a couple of weeks, they're moving the whole show to New York? Yeah, I read about it in New York, I think. So from the Villa Borghese to the airport, to get the Rome- Paris- New York plane, they'll call out the troops and the tanks. For 50 million? That's for sure. And there's nothing we can do during the trip. And at the Paris stopover, the same thing, only different uniforms. And when they land in New York, you multiply your troops and tanks by 10. There you are at the New York show with the same alarm system. Multiplied by 10. WOMAN: (IN ITALIAN) May I help you, gentlemen? - I'll take this plane, batteries and all. - Well, I'll take... - This bunch. - Would you like them gift- wrapped? BOTH: Of course. (IN FRENCH) Listen, I've got an idea. What if that plane doesn't land in New York? - You mean hijack it? - Well, why not? That's okay when you're in politics. You land at a foreign airport, they kiss you, give out medals. We land at a foreign airport, they call out the fuzz. I can just see the red carpet right to the lockup. Listen, both of us, let's think about it. ANTONIO: If I come up with anything, I'll send you somebody with the other half. You do the same. And if we don't come up with anything, we'll meet in another 40 years. Well, why not? You never change a bit. (BOTH LAUGH) Can I help you, sir? Mr. Manalese? Yeah. (INAUDIBLE) Well, he's got a great idea, that Tony. I'll be back. Listen, Luigi. Tell Theresa to go down to Menton and rent us a big house, isolated, not too far from the Italian border. - Got anything to drink around here? - Sure. What would you like? Scotch, vodka, gin, whatever you got. VITTORIO: Léoni. Léoni, I need five doctored passports. Who for? Aldo, Sergio, Luigi, Jeanne and me. - When can you have them? - Oh, in about a week. - But what names do you want? - Something honest- sounding... Wait. Uh... "Charles Bosquet." "Suzanne Haussmann." "René Perrére." "André Spontini." And "Robert Levalois." That makes five. You can't do this! I got my rights! My God, I'm gonna fall! I'm gonna complain to your chief. That's right, I'm gonna... All right, I'm listening. What do you want me to say? I don't understand. You want to complain to the chief? Well, here's your chance. I'm listening. I was sound asleep. They burst into my room and turned everything upside down. Not that they found anything. I got nothing to hide. What right have they got to... That's all? Yes, that's all. I want a lawyer. I... Look, inspector, I'll catch a cold. I got a delicate constitution. I'll tell you what. We'll forget about the junk if you're reasonable and you help us out. This mean anything to you? "Pascal Astalde." Sorry, inspector. I don't know the name. And the picture. You don't know the face either? No. You got the second bag? Hey, wait a minute. Isn't that Sartet? Bright boy, Robel. You have everything figured out. These are the fake papers Sartet had on him when he was arrested, right. Robel, who did this job? It's not bad work, inspector. I've seen better, but it's good enough. I don't want an opinion. I want a name and address. I don't operate like that. I can't do it. Inspector, I just can't do it. Professional conscience? - Yes, it is. You know I can't tell you an address, inspector. Well, see, I'm not like you. I'll give you one. A good one. Police headquarters. To cool off a while. Take him away. - Inspector! - Yes! I can't think of the name of the street, but I can take you there. WOMAN: Who is it? - It's me, Raymond. - WOMAN: It's Raymond. MALIK: Let him in. (WOMEN SCREAMING) LE GOFF: You Malik? I beg your pardon. Have we met? We'll get around to the introductions. Take this bunch in, and drop Robel on the way. You recognize these? I don't do identity photos. As you see, my field is art photography. Listen, Malik. Listen to me. I could be persuaded to forget about your artistic photography. Sartet needs papers. You made these. So he needs a set from you again. Have you seen him? Look, inspector, that's all in the past. Can't you see I've given up documents? Otherwise, I wouldn't be messing around with dirty pictures. That makes sense, doesn't it? And don't ask me if I have a search warrant. (MUMBLES) - (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) - Ah. Well, here you have it. I think we've hit the jackpot. "Levalois, Robert." "Perrére, René." "Bosquet, Charles." "Spontini, André." "Haussmann, Suzanne." Which one's for Sartet? None of them, inspector. Sartet is too hot to handle. Nobody will touch him now. He's bad news. I want the photos to these passports. The pictures, Malik. I'll tear the place apart. You know I'll find them. So why not give them to me? In there, inspector. Honest to God. It's the negative. But I swear you won't find Sartet. You can see for yourself. I'll develop it right now. Damn it! They're exposed. I think you made a mistake. Take him away. - Develop it anyway. You never know. - Mmm- hmm. - MAN: Inspector. - Yeah? MAN: Look at this. - These must be very special friends. - Four of them. You take the first two. I'll do the other two. I'll start with this Léoni. We'll leave when the passports are fixed. And Sartet? He'll be on the road in a few minutes. - Who's driving? - Jeanne. Tell her not to go too fast. - Boss. - What? It's about Malik. A little while ago, I told you... I told you he didn't have your number. - Has he got it or not? - He doesn't, boss. He doesn't have it. - Well, then. - But he's got mine. With that, they can find out where I work, see. But you'll see. Nothing will happen. He isn't the kind that talks. Nothing will happen. That's right. Nothing will happen, except a visit from the police someday. I'll get Mr. Manalese. Don't stop on the way. The villa is on the San Remo road, at the exit for Menton. You want to see me? - You're Mr. Manalese? - Yeah. - Chief Inspector Le Goff. - l'm pleased to meet you. I'd like to ask one of your employees a few questions. I'll get him for you. What's his name? Léoni Oh, come to think of it, Léoni. I fired him. Must have been two, three months ago. I can look it up in my books. You mind telling me why he was fired? It wasn't because of his work, you see. It's a kind of touchy subject. What do you mean, touchy? Well, because I have no proof. He was making a phone call one day. A funny kind of call, something about driver's licenses and passports. Sounded like he was making a little extra on the side with some shady deals. Fake documents? I couldn't be sure, but I felt safer getting rid of him. You should've notified the police. Yeah, I know, but I told you I couldn't prove it. Besides, he's Sicilian, too. I wanted to give him a break, but not here. See, inspector, this is a family business. And I plan to retire to Sicily soon and I want to leave with a good reputation. These passports... I don't suppose you know anything about them? "Bosquet." "Perrére." "Levalois." It's a real map of Paris. No, doesn't mean anything to me. Now what about these pictures? (CHUCKLES) It's a joke. That's right, Mr. Manalese, a bad joke for us. A light that went on too soon, and we're back where we started from. Don't mind me. (CAR STARTING) - I won't say, "See you soon." - lt's no bother, inspector. Drop in any time. It's no bother. (PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) - What would you like? - Fruit juice, please. - Orange juice or... - Whatever. Thank you. WALK OUT TO THE CURB SOMEONE IS WAITING FOR YOU. MAN: (ON RADIO) Both teams are lined up for the second quarter of this championship match. There they go. Smile and pretend you're talking to me. SARTET: Monique, no! Don't look this way. Just listen. I'm going away, Monique. I'm leaving Europe for good. You've had trouble on account of me. But that's over now. Monique, what are you crying about? You're through with lawyers, sending packages and visiting days. Take over for me, will you? - What's the score? - Two to one. - What's going on down there? - Nothing. She's gabbing with a friend. What a nice shot by Seaman! I'll send you money as soon as I get to where I'm going. Aldo will send it to a P.O. box. Well, that's it. I didn't wanna leave without saying goodbye. Take care of yourself, sis. JEANNE: I never saw anybody kill a fish in such an awful way. You haven't seen much. (GASPS) Listen, darling. You mustn't tell your mama you saw me here. Why not? Because your mama doesn't want me to go swimming. You promise you won't, Roberto? You won't tell a soul? (CAR APPROACHES) VITTORIO: Listen, you. From now on, not one drop of liquor. - Get it? - Don't sweat it. I know when to quit. I hope so. Good evening, Sartet. All right. It's for the day after tomorrow. There'll be eight of them. Four jewelers, three guards and a man from the insurance company. He's arriving tomorrow from London. He's got a room at the Minerva Hotel. His name is Evans. Edward J. Evans.
