Abdel Sabour, wake up. Wake up. Wake up, it's almost noon. Mother. Watch out. My legs. Ahmad. Wake Abdel Sabour. He's oversleeping. What for? Let him sleep. You go. Take care of the cow. Watch out for crows. - OK. - Goodbye. Most gracious God, grant us nice weather, keep the sun clement. May the donkey work hard, and may the cow give us a lot of milk. God, keep the rats off the crops, and shield the plants from worms. God, please answer my prayers. You are all-powerful. Patience. This is the last load. Tomorrow you'll rest. I know you're pregnant. My god grant you a donkey to share the load with you. Let's go. Be strong. Abdel Sabour. Here's your food. Watch out for flies. Shoo them away. Watch the chicks. Don't let the cat get them. I said watch out for flies. - Hello, Ahmad. - Hello, Ibrahim. Ahmad. Sab'e El Leil. Yes. - What is it? - Swimming? You're contaminating our drinking water. Get out. Wait for the girls to pass. God damn you, stupid kid. OK. Out of the way. What's this military service, mayor? And who will take care of our land? Ahmad is all I got. See the other one for yourself. He's incapable of doing anything. How could they draft my only son? How can one talk sense to this stupid woman? You're as dumb as him. He counts as your son, even he's retarded. Forget about Abdel Sabour. Why take Ahmad away? Spare us this scene. We don't need it. Your son has to report to the examination. If he fails to qualify, he'll come back to you whole. - And if he qualifies? - Then good for him. He'll come back to you a real man. The army will whip him into shape. He could use a kick in the butt. Did you check the headcount? - Yes sir. - First thing in the morning, you bring your sons here. They are to report tomorrow. God help you if you're late. Go home now. You heard him. Off you go. Go on. Ahmad, time to leave. I'll buy some tea. Good evening. A tea pack, please. So you're joining the army? Why did you hit me? Calm down. He's only joking. Hitting is not funny. He's already acting like a soldier. No way they take him. He's unfit. Why? Am I lame or blind? Or a hunchback, like your dad? The problem is in your head, buddy. A donkey has more sense than you. Get lost. Sure. This garment made you arrogant. God helps us if you buy trousers too. Your father doesn't even wear briefs. You're a funny guy. Why do you hit me? - I'm leaving. - Where to? You must stay. We're going to miss you. I'll make you a bet. What bet? Eat half an ounce of sweet sesame. I'll eat a whole ounce. Come. You have to have some salt with it too. - I don't care. - If you eat it all, I'll pay you. If you don't, you pay for it. Deal. Half an ounce of sweet sesame with salt. Go ahead. Right there. There. Come on, Sab'e El Leil. Give me the sesame. I have it. Here's the salt. What should I eat first? Save the sweets for the end. Start with the salt. Have you no shame? What if he dies because of this? Ahmad. Why do you allow them to make a fool of you? What can I do, Hussein? You have to pay for the sesame and the salt. You call this sesame? Go get something worth the money. Don't worry about it. I'll pay for it. We'll share it. What does this army business mean? You'll be a soldier. Like a policeman? No, a police officer is different. The police goes after thieves. The army protects the nation from its enemies. But we have no enemies. We might have an enemy some day. If we're ever attacked, we must be ready to protect ourselves. So army service is good? Of course. If you're lucky to be accepted, you'll become a better man. I hope so. It pains me to leave my mother and brother alone. God will help them. THE INNOCENT WRITTEN BY WAHID HAMED Ahmad. Move it. Just a moment. Quit fiddling, boy. Move it already. Goodbye, lads. DIRECTED BY ATEF EL-TAIEB Turn left. Go in. Move it. Ahmad Sab'e El Leil. Yes. There is no "yes" here. It's "yes, sir". "Yes" is for your mom. - Yes, sir. - Move, on the double. Next. On the first row, you have five squares. Each square represents an animal. One square is different than the other four. Identify the unique square, and mark it with an X. - Understood? - Yes, sir. Names of soldiers nominated for guard duty. Ahmad Faraj Mohammad. Hassanein Abdel Jawad. Issa Abdel Kader. Ahmad Sab'e El Leil. Sir. Sir. Welcome back. I hope you brought us a treat. I got you a fresh batch to relieve you. - I was hoping for something else. - Open up. Do you still refuse to say who incited you to go on hunger strike? Get up. Stand up, you pussy. Move him. Halt. Turn left. Sacks down. Any of them knows how to read and write? None, sir. Can't even spell their names. - Any city boys? - None, sir. All born and raised in distant villages. Name? Ahmad Sab'e El Leil, sir. You know him? He's my friend, sir. Slap him on the face. Why did you hit him? I must obey orders, even if they're wrong, sir. Slap him back. They can rest today. They start tomorrow. Carry on. Attention. At ease. Don't move until I register your names. Lunch is ready. You may eat. You may not use your hands. You may not touch it with your hands. If you don't eat, you're on hunger strike. And I know exactly how to deal with hunger strikers. Begin. Attention. Pick up your sacks. Turn left. Forward, march. Who are they? They are the cause of our troubles. Meaning? Enemies of the state. Enemies of the state? Why do you feed them? They don't deserve a morsel. God help us. What's this for? Are there no other beds? Why put up with this? Why don't we just finish off the enemies of the state? Finish them off how? Kill them and be done with it. Then we can go home. I wonder how mother is doing. Do you want to pick the gift, or should I choose for you? You choose, daddy. Don't leave the car, OK? Can I help you, sir? I need a gift for a 6 year old girl. - A doll? - No, something else. She has many dolls. How about something educational? This way, please. We just got a new set. Police and thieves. What police and thieves? I want... something gentle. A guitar? Sure, as long as she can play it. It's like a real one, - just smaller. - Good. A guitar it is. Sergeant, be nice. No need for a ticket. I stopped just a minute ago. I hear this all day long. Minutes pile up and start counting. It's too much. Just go. I appreciate it. Bye. I got her a guitar. - That's very nice. - My love. It's too much. - Did he say he'll be late? - No. Then where is he? How would I know? That must be him. - Good evening. - Hello, colonel. - Come in. - No, I can't. I'll leave her here, and I'll pick her up later. Tawfeek, please. You must stay. We insist. - No, it's that... - Please. Please come in, I'm already stressed. Why are you upset? The magician left his kit and never came back. The kids will be so disappointed. There's no need to be upset. It's going to be fine. Calm down. One moment. Come here. Come here kids. Look here. OK, pay attention. - What's this? - A stick. - What? - A stick. I can hit things with it. Naughty kids get the stick. I'll use it for something else. Pay attention. Say after me, Pica Chica Pocatica. Pica Chica Pocatica. A round of applause. - What are those? - Handkerchiefs. Take one. What color is it? - Red. - What color? - Red. - What color? - Red. - I'll put it here. Where did it go? - Where is it? - It flew away. - What color is this one? - Yellow. Where is it now? - Where is it? - In your hand. Look closely. Where's the third one? - What color is this one? - Green. Once more. Where did it go? How many were there? Three. - First color? - Red. - Second color? - Yellow. - Third color? - Green. Where are they? There's more. You have them. Where are they? Hand me your hat. Here they are. They're in there. The green one. Yellow. And... where's the red one? Here it is. Round of applause. Attention. The troops are in order, sir. No absentees, no furloughs, no illnesses. The prisoners are all accounted for. No escapes, no illnesses, no deaths. At your command, sir. Are you a communist, boy? No, sir. Then what are you? I like women, sir. Weren't you arrested at a demonstration? It was a women's march, sir. My office window overlooks the street. I heard female voices, and saw the march, so I joined them. Why did you join them? Are you sympathetic to their cause? No sir, I have nothing to do with causes. My interests are non-political: Behinds, and fronts... Breasts, chests... They were communist women. Communists, capitalists, opportunists... It's all women to me. So you're a pervert? Yes, sir. I deserve to be beaten. Please transfer me to vice, sir. What do you do? - I write. - Write? What do you write? Stories. Novels. Dirty novels? Readers and writers of dirty novels don't end up here. Doctor Ali Khalifah? Yes, sir. What's your mother's name? It's in my file. Age? It's in my file too. - You wife... - Yes? She's 19. How did you sleep with her? That's in my file too. So you know that nothing can be hidden from us. All in the file, right? Divorce your wife. She filed a complaint, stating sexual deprivation. She's afraid of becoming a delinquent. May I see the complaint? You're saying I'm a liar? I advise you to consider it. We need your expertise here. Your... doctorate, it's in... - geology, right? - Yes. This desert is rich in minerals. There's possibly oil, gold, metals. We'd like you to prospect. There are only scorpions and snakes out here. I won't divorce, and I won't prospect. If you've been ordered to execute me, then please just do it. Rope. Hello? How are you, Sahar? I miss you. I'm upset with you. Upset? Why? You didn't say goodbye. I'm sorry, darling. I'll make it up to you. Where's mommy? Mommy always goes out and leaves me alone. It's OK. Mom has social obligations. Let her know I called, OK? Bye, darling. You orders, sir? - Regarding what? - The inmates. Dig the well. They dug it during your vacation, sir. - Any water? - No, sir. Fill it. Yes, sir. This will pass. Our ancestors went through this while digging the Suez canal. But their suffering was worthwhile. The canal was later nationalized. - Everything OK? - Yes, sir. Make sure the dogs don't escape. How would they dare, sir? They all deserve to die. Stay alert. Don't worry. I will. Thank god there are only few enemies. Good. - Private Sab'e El Leil. - Sir. Tower 3. Forward, march. You, private. Pay attention. You think you're in your field? - Where to, Rashad? - One moment. Watch out for snakes. I wish a snake would bite me. How could you say that, mister Rashad? Death by snake or scorpion is preferable to death by colonel Sharkas. I want to die with my dignity intact. How? We must escape. Escape where? The dogs will eat you. If the dogs don't get you, the desert will. It's better to just die here. The bird of justice is imprisoned. Its cage is cursed and miserable. Its bars are mute, and cannot hear the prisoner's cries. Its bars know not of the suffering of man. And its iron does not bleed when the homeland bleeds. Between the darkness here and the light there, I'm a prisoner, with my songs, in a cold and silent cage. No matter how narrow my cell, under my jailer's gaze, in darkness I rise, even on smoke. And I tearfully sing for the homeland's joy. And I tearfully sing for the homeland's joy. What are you waiting for? Put down your weapons. Stand aside. Turn around. Are you with me? Rashad, don't do it. As you wish. What happened? My rifle. Why did you let him go? The rifle. Wait. Wait. I don't want to hurt you. You idiot. What are you doing? I got you. I got you, you enemy of the state. The state. Hurry up. Orders issued by colonel Tawfik Sharkas, commander of area 777, on the day of September 28. Promotions. Soldier 932,567 Ahmad Sab'e El Leil Radwan Al Fouli is promoted to corporal, for exceptional courage and sacrifice for the homeland. Furloughs. Corporate Sab'e El Leil Radwan Al Fouli is granted a 10 day furlough effective 12:00 today. Obey God, obey the homeland, obey your orders. Corporate Sab'e El Leil. Quick march. When you're back, report to my office. Yes, sir. Watch out for the rudder. How much are oranges? It's at market price. - And bananas? - Twice as much as oranges. And this? You don't know what it's called? I know it. It's a plum. How much is it? That's an apple, conscript. A pound is worth a month's salary? 4 pounds of bananas and oranges. Sure. - Is that Ahmad, Steita's son? - Yes, that's him. He's changed so much. - He looks respectable. - Who would have thought? Hello. - Who are you? - I'm your brother. I'm Ahmad. Don't you recognize me? Is it really you? Ahmad? My brother's back. Where's mother? In the field. She's in the field. Mother. My son. I want to hold you, but I don't want to soil your uniform. I missed you so much. Since you left, we've been plagued. I can't handle the land. It's too hard. Look at the crop. It's failing. Don't worry. I'm here for 10 days. I'll make it the best crop around. You go rest. Have some bananas. Enjoy. - You have some. - You want an orange? You have it. On my next leave, I'll get you a new robe. A black satin one. Never mind that. Get something for your brother. I want chicken, mother. Have some patience, son. - Chicken - Enough. Chicken. Mister Shaker. Shaker. What is it? A cigarette. That would be the fourth one. You haven't paid. I'll give you 5 eggs. Go convince your mother to give you the eggs. I don't want her to complain to me. Sab'e El Leil, you've changed a lot. Welcome, Ahmad. We've missed you. Since you've left, we've been bored. You must have something. Get him a soda. Thank you. There's no need. Have you seen mister Hussein? Why would he be here? He went to Cairo for college a month ago. Too bad. I wanted to see him. How's the army? Good. What do you do? We fight the enemies of the state. He's joking around. We're not at war. This guy is saying we're at war. There's no war. Are you calling me a liar? I swear to god I'm fighting the enemies. One of them wounded me. What do you know? The enemies are attacking while you loaf around here. Thank god, I've honored our village. I've received two stripes for bravery. Maybe there's a secret war going on. You shouldn't take risks, Ahmad. Don't divulge any military secrets to us. Do you want to forget me? Hello. And add to my deprivation? Forget me, and I'll forget you. I won't return to you. Hello. How are you, sir? How are you, son? How are you doing? Thank god. The army has changed you. Thank god. I wanted to see Hussein. I heard he went to college. May he succeed in his studies. He loves you too. You were born on the same week. I want to visit him. He's dear to me. Is your unit stationed in Cairo? No, we're in the desert. But I have to go through Cairo. We're in a forsaken, isolated place. - So you'll go to Cairo? - Yes. I'm going to give you his address. I'll entrust you with an important charge - to deliver to Hussein. - I am ready. Hurry up. Your father is coming. Good evening. - How are you? - Good. Great job, Nawarah. This bread looks lovely. It smells so nice. I'm baking it for Hussein. He's my dearest brother. May he marry soon. She should marry first. When will that be? A dentist in Cairo will certify her age. She has no birth certificate. What reminded you of this now? She's getting lots of proposals. Of course, she's so lovely. Here, Ahmad. I would walk you to the train, but I'm exhausted. - Forgive me. - Don't worry, sir. Keep an eye on the girl. Watch out for city folks. I know. They have no morals. Heed Ahmad's word. - He's like your brother. - Yes, father. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. - Go ahead. - Thank you. Look here. Me? Yes, you. The train is spacious. Why sit here? I can sit where I like. No, you can't. - I'll show you. - Calm down, soldier. He didn't do anything. He's being insolent. - Cover your face. - If you're so worried, why not sit next to her? I won't budge. Is that so? Fine. - Listen, aunt. - Yes. Come sit next to a girl, shield her from a bad man. You're right. Even I get harassed. Come. Get up. Exchange seats. And if I don't? I'll pluck your eyes out. - Move. - OK. Sit down. The tram is nearby. The tram is already crowded. Get lost. Never mind him. Why is this beauty walking with this donkey? She needs a real man. Wait for me. Someone help. Woe is me. Ahmad, please stop. Calm down, it's over now. Hadn't been for you, I would have killed them. This place is scary. Thank god it's over. I'm sorry we lost some of the food. Forget about it. Thank god you were not hurt or arrested. You really made me proud. Thank you. You've relieved me. I'll tell my brother and father about your chivalry. You're fearless. Come here. Two. How much? RASHAD EWEIS WAS MURDERED Anybody here? Ahmad? Hussein. Everyone sends their regards. You father has sent you a special present. - How are you? - Good. Come in, Nawarah. Your sister is here, with 15 pounds, and provisions. Nuwarah? Welcome. Welcome to Cairo. So nice to see you, brother. Magdi? Invite everyone. I got food from the village. Yes. Chicken pies, cheese and honey. We must eat it tonight. Come over. - Eat some more. - I will. Enjoy. We must divide the duck equally. There are too many of us. Nawarah will split it. Of course. Why just one duck, Hussein? Maybe that was the last one. How could you say that? Your father is prospering. Ducks, geese, pigeons... The basket was full of birds. They stole it when Ahmad fought them. Such monsters. So it's Ahmad's fault. We'll get more food next time. That was really good. Don't save food for us. Eat some more. I'm full. I know you aren't. Have some more. Never mind them. Sit, Ahmad. You forget me, and I'll forget you. You have lost me forever. - Hello, Nasser. - Hurry up. - What is it? - I don't know. Commander. - Sir. - What is it? I am back, sir. Sit by the door. Stay alert. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. This is Sharkas. No, sir. They have not arrived yet. We are ready, sir. You need not worry. If this happens, sir, you may flog me. Goodbye. Are you all set? - Yes, sir, - Yes, sir. I did not realize that dog Rashad was a famous writer. His death has made an impression. What did he ever write, anyway? Open up. It's not a prison. It's no ordinary jail. This is a hotel. Better than a hotel. Its only drawback is its location. However... It holds a special advantage for our residents. Since they're intellectuals and thinkers, they need an isolated spot to meditate and ponder. This is a retreat. We treat them with our methods. Our methods are humane. Other countries would bury them alive. Not so here. We merely isolate them from others. You will judge by yourselves. We must all abide by the law. You represent law and justice, and your report will end the rumors and lies. Regarding the death of Rashad Eweis, that was a shame. He frequently eloped, and we always restored him safely. Sadly, last time, a new soldier overreacted, and shot in the air to make him stop. Unfortunately, he was hit. Hello, men. Truly a hotel, or perhaps a retreat. A place to mediate and recharge. As you can see. Let's visit the club. You can see. It's quite clear. Hello, Mohammad. It's a modest library. Our own library of Alexandria. - "Inquisition courts"? - Yes, sir. Why read this book? To appreciate this place. - What's your name? - Hazem. - What do you do? - I'm a history teacher. - Do you have any complaints? - Yes. - What is it? - The drinking water. It's too warm. We are addressing this problem. We bring ice in trucks, but most of it melts on the road. God willing, we're installing freezers soon. Prisoners back to their cells. RASHAD EWEIS WAS MURDERED Rashad Eweis was tortured. He died of grief. When thieves and pimps are free, and roam the streets, while thinking is a crime, and 'no' is a forbidden word, and it's met with violence, when ignorance reigns, and thought is tortured, people must die of grief. - The newspapers did not mention it. - Those are not newspapers. They're rags written to fool people. We must organize a peaceful march. Let's go. Hello? - Tawfik. - Yes, sir. We're sending you some college kids. Quite exuberant. They're causing trouble. I want you to teach them some manners. Yes, sir. We're ready, sir. Mister Hussein? Hands off. Mister Hussein can't be an enemy of the state. Strike. I know him, sir. We were born on the same week. His father is a great man, a devout and kind man. Hussein can't be an enemy. How could he be? He encouraged me to serve the army. What is this? Go back to work. Obey orders. Strike. I won't strike Hussein. Disobeying orders? No, sir, but... They fooled you. We're no state enemies. Do you know what a state is? It's... Your state is your country. Your enemy doesn't resemble you. He speaks another language. He uses strange words. He wants to rob you of everything. He laughs when you cry, and rejoices when you ache. These prisoners are your countrymen. Oh, god. I killed one of them. He told me I was a fool. He said I was stupid. I am so stupid. I killed him. But you... Why are you here? Because we're not fools. Do you know what your punishment is? A court martial. You might get the firing squad. But I still like you. Here. Discipline him yourself. Still disobeying? Watch out. Someone help. Hussein. Careful. Are you alright? - Ahmad. - Yes? My room in Cairo. I want you to go there, and take Nawarah back, just like you brought her. Take care of her. Mister Hussein. Mister Hussein. Answer me. Hussein. Hussein. Answer me. Mister Hussein. Stop. I've adjusted the charge. I changed it to negligence. Demoted to private. 15 days in prison. That's all. Turn around. Forward, march. The blood on my hands whispers and says whom did you kill? It asks me. How can you tell the jailer apart from the jailed? My heart used to be innocent like a bird in flight. How did my heart betray me as I embarked on the path? You deceptive eyes, who has falsified the truth? You deceptive eyes, who has falsified the truth? Who's turned lies to truth, before my eyes, in a flash? The blood on my hands whispers and says whom did you kill? It asks me. How can you tell the jailer apart from the jailed? Turn right. Stop. - Private Sab'e El Leil. - Sir. Tower 3. Forward, march. Desouki. - What is it? - Come here. Yes? Hand me the flute. You're a silly man. Hello. Yes, sir. Your orders, sir. SUBTITLES BY KANAFANI
