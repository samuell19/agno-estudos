Oh, uh, excuse me? Do you know where the animal shelter is? I need to pick up my dog before it closes. Um... I think it's on King Street. About five blocks north of here. [Woman] Thanks a million. Or maybe more. [ Muffled screaming ] [ Sighs ] [ Doorbell rings ] Come in. Came by to return your tape measure. Thanks again. Thanks so much. Sure. So did the dimensions make sense? Yeah. Am I interrupting? Yeah, but I appreciate it. Time flies when creating, huh? I'm not sure this is coming together. Isn't that for others to decide? Yeah, I guess. They do pay good money for it. I wish I could make a living by expressing myself. Being a high school administrator is not the most lucrative career. Especially when I see the kind of income the parents of these kids make. Well, but you're helping to shape and mould young minds. While losing my own. Speaking of young minds, how's Christy doing? She's 15 and already has decided to enroll in the police academy. God help me. Like father, like daughter. Yeah, he'd be 47 years old today. And they never caught the guy. We got birthday cake. You want a piece? Before dinner? No, dessert. Thank you, but I have to finish my wallpapering. You could hire a handy man. Can't afford one. Mom, I'm home. Mmm, chocolate chip mint. No, you'll spoil dinner. Hah, we should have done this a long time ago. What if she finds out? Ugh, she won't. She's not as smart as you think she is. We're gonna take the money and run. [ Car stalls ] Oh my god. No. No! Are you kidding me? Oh my god. Wow. Wade, when are we gonna get a new car? Gimme a break, Kendra. Just let me think. Think about what? I mean, you wanna leave a dead girl in the back of the car with our prints all over it? No. No, we have to do the switch, like we said. It's fine. Never mind, I have a better idea. Get out. What? Get out of the car. Now what? We're gonna push it. Try and get it jump started. We are gonna push it? You are gonna push it. You are somethin' else. Alright princess, here we go. [ Grunting ] Faster. Faster! What? Faster! Why don't you push it?! [ Engine starts ] Yes. Get in the car! Yeah! Pedal to the metal, baby! Let's go! Go, go. Do you wanna help mom with dinner? You wanna help your daughter with her homework? You need my help? No, but it's nice to know it's available. No. Mmm. Teen angst rules. She's in the back. Oh! [ Van speeds away ] Whoo! [ Doorbell rings ] Perfect timing, Chad. I hope you like burned lasagna. Oh, it's my favourite. Liar. I saw your eyes move to the right. Telltale sign of fibbing. They were following you walking. A likely story. Hey, who's the criminal lawyer here? Yeah, but this is Christy Holmes. Sherlock's long lost kid. Well, thank you. Both of you. That was really nice. And the burned section was my favourite part. Now you tell me. Am I lying? I bet you could beat a polygraph test. I bet you're right. [ laughs ] That's a really lovely pendant, Christy. It's uh... St. Michael's, right? He's the warrior angel. The patron saint of police. My father gave it to me. Let's toast him, hmm? Hey, mom, where's my wine glass? It's bad luck to toast with water. Oh, then we'll just have to deal with it. Come on, young lady. [ Glasses clinking ] To a great cop and an even better father. I'm afraid they'll give up. File away his murder as another cold case. Well, if there's ever anything I can do, just ask. Mom, can I be excused, please? Before dessert? What do you mean? You love chocolate chip mint. Maybe later. I'm full. She never seems to take off that pendant. No. Look, I'm sorry Sue, I don't mean to... I don't know. No, Chad. It's been two years. It's time to work on closure and... I'm glad you came. Me too. [ Groans ] Get up! Go! Good god! [ Screams ] Ashley! Help! Somebody help! Help! Someone, help! Help! Please, someone, help! Help! Somebody, help! Help! Somebody, help! Ashley! Get back here, you little brat! Stop there, bitch! That's far enough, Ashley! [ Cocks gun ] Get away from me. Not gonna happen. Gotcha. [ laughs ] [ Screams ] What did you do? Is she ok? [ Chimes ringing with wind ] [ Knocking ] John. What're you doing here? This isn't a social call, Sue. Ok. Come in. So what's going on, John? We have another situation. Detective Morris? What's going on? I don't know. Does this have something to do with dad's murder? No. Uh... is there somewhere we can talk privately? Oh, yes. Sure. Honey, wait in the car, ok? Oh, come on. You can't be serious. What? I... I'm-I'm sorry, Christy. It's just, this is between your mom and I. I'm not a child anymore. This is not a discussion. [ Phone rings ] I'll get it. [ Phone rings ] Hello? Not interested. Stupid telemarketer. Ok, car. Now. Going. Ok. What's going on, John? Well, we have another situation. It's not in the press yet, we're trying to keep a lid on it, um... so I'd appreciate it if you just kept it between us- Just spit it out, ok? [ Clears throat ] There's been another kidnapping. Who? A 15 year old girl named Ashley Whitmore was last seen at her school yesterday. Wealthy parents? Yeah. It sounds familiar. Can this be related? Possibly. That's why I'm here. If they-if they are related then I want to make sure I get 'em this time. Good. 'Cause I don't want any more families to suffer the way we have. Susan I want them as badly as you do. Sorry if I find that hard to believe. Frank was my partner. I've searched every day for his killers. After the kidnappings ceased the-the trail went dry, you know that. And if they are back I will do what I can to take them down, trust me. How can I help? Um... does Frank have any personal files around? Any notes about the case? Well, I thought your department took everything after he died. Yes, we took all of his active files but you know as well as I do Frank was old school. The guy jotted everything down on paper. Ideas, questions he had, theories. You know, stuff like that. Ok, yeah. I will look around. See what I can find. I really have to get Christy to school. Yeah, understood. I uh... I'm sorry to drop by unannounced, but... but thanks. Any-anything that you can do to help us out would be appreciated. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Here. Look, I appreciate your help, Sue. If you... if you find anything, just call the office. Yeah, we will. Thanks for coming by. Sorry about that. If you're late I'll give you a note. So what was that all about? Another girl went missing yesterday. It could be related to your father's case or it could not. Ok. [ Phone ringing ] Hey, beautiful. Thanks, I needed that. Bad day? For Ashley Whitmore and her family. I just dropped Christy off at school. Detective John Morris stopped by this morning. And he told you about the missing girl? You know about this? I have my reliable snitches. So I have a question for you. If you were an old fashioned by-the-book detective where would you put your personal notes? In a safe? Chad. He doesn't have a s- What about-what about um... behind a filing cabinet? Taped to the bottom of a desk drawer? Maybe behind a photograph? Be serious. Didn't you tell me he was into spy novels? Yeah-yeah. Oh my god. Sue? Sue, are you there? Susan? Hello? Oh my god. Oh. Was I right? Chad, I will call you back. Ok, um- [ hangs up ] Oh my god. "Red dirt on tire". "Multiple perps". "Inside job". I wonder if he means in the department? [ Phone rings ] Yes? [Man] Uh, yes. Hello. Is this Susan? Uh, who's calling? Phil Stoppard. Of Stoppard Galleries in San Francisco? Remember? Oh, yes! Hi, Mr. Stoppard. Gosh, we really are looking forward to the opening. [Stoppard] Yes, we all are. [Stoppard] In fact, we've got such a favourable reaction we're moving up the opening to this weekend. Have you not been following the media? Oh, no, no. I've been busy. [Stoppard] Right, well I booked two first class tickets for you and set up interviews. Sorry for the short notice. When? [Stoppard] Well, it's tonight. Tonight? [Stoppard] Yes. It's not an issue, is it? Oh, no, no. Of course not. I'm um... I wouldn't miss this for the world. Thank you. Thank you so much again. [Stoppard] Fantastic. I shall see you there, then. Ok. Bye bye. Hello? B... Bye. [Woman] Hi, Susan. Oh! Teri! Oh, I'm sorry. The front door was ajar. I thought you were back working in your studio. Yeah, no, no, no. That's ok. It's ok. It's alright, I'm just a little jumpy. Too much coffee? Uh, no, actually. Detective John Morris stopped by this morning. That'll do it. There's been another abduction. But there's nothing in the news. I know, I know. The police are keeping it quiet. They don't want to cause a panic, but he thinks it might be related to the kidnappings two years ago. He asked if Frank had any notes around. You mean lying around the house? And then, um, Stoppard Galleries called me, remember? From San Francisco? They're so excited, the buzz has been so great they're moving up the opening. When? Tonight. That is so exciting. You deserve it. I really want Christy to go, but she has finals and I-I can't miss this. I don't know. I just can't miss this opening. And you shouldn't. It's only a two-hour flight. Listen, I could look in on Christy while you're away. Maybe even spend the night if it'll make you feel better. Oh, you'd be a godsend, Teri. That's what neighbours are for, right? Thank you. Thank you, thank you. I'm gonna make a call. Hello again. Hi, glad I got you. I have a question for you. What's up? Well, how would you like to take an all-expense paid trip to San Francisco with me tonight? How can I turn that down? I knew we should have done this one by ourselves. Yeah. We needed the money, remember? [ Phone ringing ] I had a feeling you'd be calling. Don't yell at me. Why do you think? Yeah, I get it. I get it. I get it. But look. What's done is done. Besides, we got a lot bigger problem. And it's not just kidnapping anymore. What? You know, it's a miracle the ice cream stays solid in the house. I mean, it's never in the freezer long enough. It takes 43 minutes to melt. I know. I've timed it. Why? So it wouldn't melt before I got home. Mmm. So mom, why can't I come? Come on, you know why. I can study on the trip. Oh, honey, it's only two nights and Teri will keep an eye on you. I'm a little old for a babysitter. I know that. I'm aware. But safety in numbers, ok? [ Doorbell rings ] I'm late. So go. I love you. I know. I'm quite lovable. Mmmhmm, when you're not being a brat. Like I said, teen angst rules. Hey. Hey. You ready? Yeah. How come Chad's going? Ah, you know, I got two days off for good behaviour. Yeah. Remember, no boys while I'm gone. Not a problem. I only like men. Lose something? Oh, Miss Simmons. I didn't hear you knock. I used the spare key your mom gave me in case of an emergency. You knew I was coming over. Yeah, you know, I already have enough homework. This is my homework. Files and files, students and parents, colleges they want to attend. You know, what's feasible and what's not in their budget. Fun stuff, right? So you're working in here? Do you mind? Your mom said it would be ok. You can study here with me. Uh, no. I'll be in my room. [ Phone rings ] What is it? I'm busy. Where are you? I'm over at the Baker's place. What? No don't. I said-hello? Hello? Oh, I didn't know you were on the phone. Sorry. Oh, Christy. Sorry, I'm having a slight family emergency. My brother's in a bit of a bind. I might have to step out for a few minutes. [ Doorbell rings ] I'll get it. [ Doorbell rings ] Can I help you? Honey, it's ok. They came over to see me. This is my younger brother, Damien, and his girlfriend. Nica. Hi Christy. You know me? Of course we do. Yeah, I mean, Teri's told us all about you and your parents. Really? Really. Hey, those are my father's files. Where did you find them- [ muffled screaming ] She knows! [ Groans ] [ Screams ] What the hell? I told you we had a situation with the Whitmore girl. Well, now we have two situations. Get her and that file! Christy? [ Voice mail ] Hello, Susan Brown is unavailable to answer the phone right now. Please leave a message. [ long beep ] Christy? Get the van! Mmm. Chocolate chip mint. Don't make this any more difficult than it has to be. Oh, there you are. Hello sweetheart. [ Light chatter ] I told you we were coming over to discuss the Whitmore girl but you kept ignoring me! Because we were done with this operation two years ago when Frank Baker got too close to us, remember? Yeah, you took care of that, didn't you? And now we have to take care of his daughter because of you two knuckleheads. You wanted out, we needed the money. You think I don't remember Ashley Whitmore was the next victim I selected? We were gonna cut you in. You were gonna scam me. Ok. Where do you want us to take her? Take her to my cabin, get rid of her there. Burn these while you're at it in case there's anything that might incriminate us. Hey, what about the- So how do I look? Quite the beautiful sculptor you are. [ laughs ] Oh, please. Hey, come on, I'm using my best lines and you're not even paying attention. I'm sorry, I'm just worried. I don't know why Christy hasn't called me back. She probably just went out for a bite to eat with Teri. Did you check your messages? Yeah. You could call her on her... Oh, oh. You're always right. She left a message. [ Muffled sounds ] What is that? Sounds like she pocket dialed you. [ Muffled sounds ] [ Dial tone ] I'm just gonna call her and uh, just tell her that we landed ok. Ok, but we're late. I'll just be a minute. [ Phone ringing ] [ Phone ringing ] Hi. Hi, honey. It's your mother again. Um, Chad and I are at the gallery and uh, I just hope you're studying and not driving Teri nuts. So call me. Love you. Call me when you get this. Bye. Ready? Yeah. Hi. Susan, hello! I'll get the gas, you keep her quiet. Hey, pump number two! I just don't know why she's not answering. Sue, she's a teenager. She probably doesn't want you calling every 15 minutes. Now who are you calling? I am just gonna call the house. One... [ phone ringing ] Hello, Baker residence? Teri, hi, it's me. Uh, how are you? You sound out of breath. Yeah, I just ran back from my place. I forgot my highlighters for the transcripts I'm reviewing. Uh huh. So is everything alright? Yeah, I just left Christy in her room. She's been listening to music and studying all evening. Do you want me to get her? Yeah, that would be great, just for a minute. Um, she's not answering her cell, so... Oh. Ok. Um, Christy! Your mom's on the phone. She's getting her. Christy? Susan, now don't panic, but Christy's not in her room. Where is she? I... honestly don't know. Is she alright? No. Oh my god. [ Muffled struggling ] Shhh! Calm down before I calm you down for good. You got it? Mmmhmm. Now listen to me. You're not gonna get hurt if you behave. In fact, if you're a really good girl I'll get you a treat. How about chocolate chip mint ice cream? Yeah. Would you like that? Mmm-mmm. What? Do you need to say something? Mmmhmm. Scream and you're dead. Bathroom. You can't hold it? You got a sweet tooth, huh? I have a sweet everything. You wanna know what I have? A key to the bathroom, I hope. [ laughs ] Yeah. I do. It won't do you any good though, the bathroom's out of order. There's a Port-a-Potty around the side that's open. Thank you. Hey, you-nah. Alright. You better not try anything. Ok? I won't. There you go, buddy. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. You need a receipt? No, I'm good. Thank you. Have a good day. And remember, this little baby can shoot through plastic. Hey. Hello? What's taking so long? Hey! You done? Woah, woah, woah. I need to make sure you didn't write a "help, I've been kidnapped" note. Good girl. Get up. Get up. Are you ok there? Yeah, she's fine. She just partied a little too hard last night. You get it? Oh, ok. In you go. Not smart. I tripped. I'm sorry. You will be. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Where's my daughter? Susan! You got back fast. Yeah, we took the first flight out. Is she back yet? I looked everywhere. She's probably at a friend's house. This is not like her. You don't understand. If she was ok she would have called me back. I'm sorry Susan. I was gone 10 minutes, 15 tops. Any word from her? Uh-uh. I'm calling the police. Sue, she hasn't been gone 48 hours yet. They can't do anything. No, that's just a myth. If there's reasonable suspicion of a crime the police can act immediately. I'll call John. He'll help. Especially when I show him this. Where is it? Where'd it go? Where did what go? There was an envelope here with Frank's notes. It's not here. Was Christy messing around in here last night? When I first arrived, I didn't think anything of it at the time. So Christy and Frank's notes are missing? What a coincidence. [ laughing menacingly ] [ Sobbing ] Uh, Miss Simmons, you said that Christy was here when-when you arrived. Uh huh. You uh, you said she went to study. You went back to your house for 15 or 20 minutes. When you got back here she was gone, is that correct? I didn't even know she left until Susan called and asked me to check on her. She was blasting her music all night so I just figured that she was still up there. And that was what time? Around 9:30. It was uh, 9:25. I checked the time on my cell. Christy's call came in earlier. Ok. And exactly when was that call? Uh, when we landed. I was uh, actually talking to Susan. Well, I didn't hear the message 'til later, but she made the call at 8:43. Here, listen. At first I thought it was just a pocket call, but now I hear the words "happened" and "true". [ Muffled message plays ] And this could be the sound of a struggle. Listen. Ok, Susan, I'll have the call analyzed but this still doesn't help prove that she was kidnapped. Alright, uh, you were here at 8:43 weren't you... I think I'll ask the questions, thank you, Mr. Armstrong. Uh, yeah. I was going over some transcripts. Christy was up in her room. [Detective] And you said that she was alone. As far as I know. I know my daughter. Something happened to her. Well, I need a little more to go on than just a mother's intuition, Sue. Look. Susan's daughter is missing. Susan is not under suspicion and neither is Christy. Or do I have that wrong? Everyone is under suspicion when a crime is committed, especially family. You, as a criminal attorney, should know that, Mr. Armstrong. Then spit it out. Who took the files? [Christy] I can take some of the blame. I came by and distracted Susan right after she got that phone call from the art gallery. I didn't mean to. Ok, look. Someone is jeopardizing this investigation. Those files are vital in finding Frank's killer and not to mention trying to find out who abducted Ashley Whitmore. Which is why we called the police. That's your job. But nothing went missing except for the files and Christy. I don't like your attitude, John. For all we know, Christy took the files and is out there somewhere right now playing detective. Christy wouldn't do that. Oh, she wouldn't, huh? No. Oh, come on. The little miss detective? Who is still angry as hell that her father was killed? Alright, that's enough. Christy's not a thief, she's the victim. As far as Susan's concerned she's been very cooperative. She's given you her statement so if you want to continue this- this line of questioning then read her her rights and book her. Oh, well, on what charge? Exactly. What are you, her lawyer? Yeah, I am now. What're you doing? You're supposed to be burning those. Oh, you don't want to hear about how close. Frank Baker was to catching us? Yeah, I do, actually. It looks like he was suspecting your sister. He wrote something here about it being an inside job. Once you start connecting the students it's not that hard to figure out who has that kind of information. The Whitmore girl was supposed to be an easy payday. And now we have to make two girls disappear. Permanently. [ Quietly sobbing ] Come on. [ Quietly sobbing ] I just came by to make sure that you're alright. And that you don't do anything stupid. Like what? Like if something happened to Christy you might take one too many sleeping pills or... Kill myself? When someone loses a loved one it's known to happen. Teri, if this is your idea of helping me I don't think I need it. I'm alright. I'll be around if you need anything. Hey. It's gonna be alright. It will, now that you're in our corner. Sue, I've always been in your corner. [ Sobbing ] Come on. We'll work through this. I'm going to make sure that both of you are protected. Understand? Christy is a tough girl. She's no ordinary kid. She can take care of herself. Maybe she did take Frank's notes like Morris suggested. We both know how determined she is to find out what happened to her father. She didn't know about his notes. I purposely didn't tell her so she wouldn't... so unless she found them herself... And maybe she did. It's possible. But the one thing I don't understand is why you didn't go to Detective Morris with Frank's notes in the first place. I know you, Sue. It wouldn't just slip your mind. You must have had a reason. I read the pages and Frank wrote something about an inside job. And that he thinks three people were involved in the kidnappings. So you think Morris might have been involved? Frank should have had backup that night. I never liked John's alibi. And who's gonna know more about the case than the detectives working on it? Ok, ok. So you think John came here last night, that- that he waited for Teri to leave, then he came, found the notes, and took Christy? Why? She never would have let a stranger in here. It had to be someone that she knew. It had to be. Her necklace! The one she never took off. Oh my god. She left it here. It's a clue. She is in danger! Ok. We can't rely on the cops. We gotta be proactive. Let's just bypass the whole system. Let's go straight to the media. Can you set up a press conference? Watch me. I can't believe what you two have done. So just drop it! Not until you drop her! Drop who? The Baker girl. She can i.d. us all. She needs to vanish forever. Make it happen. What about the mom? She knows too much, too. I'll handle Susan if Susan needs handling. Now I suggest you both vanish when this is done or we'll all be doing time for murder and kidnapping. Yeah, we want money, Teri! Can't collect much with a dead girl! No, just get out of my house and get out of my life now! I really don't like the way she thinks she can just boss us around, Wade. Me neither. But I also don't like the idea of killing an innocent girl. You got another solution? I guess Teri didn't have a choice when she offed Frank Baker. [ Gasps ] Christine Baker, my client's teenaged daughter, is missing. We believe she was taken the day before last. We're appealing to the press and the public for your help. Her mother Susan would like to say a few words. Mom? I believe this is the latest kidnapping since the disappearance of Ashley Whitmore and a string of abductions that took place two years ago. Please, if anyone has any information contact me or the police. "She's 15, she's 5'6", she has brown hair, she was wearing a blue plaid shirt and she was wearing no jewelry. Go mom. I repeat: No jewelry. There you have it. Susan- [ turns off TV ] So how much are you guys asking? What? For my ransom? You know my mom will pay anything. So how much? [ laughs ] Your mom's not rich, she's an artist. Of course she is. She just had a big exhibit at the Stoppard Galleries in San Francisco. Her sculptures sell for big bucks. She's got millions in the bank. Really? Millions? Go on. Easily. She lives off my dad's pension and then banks the rest. I'm sure she'll give you whatever you want as long as you show her I'm alive and well. And I'll cooperate. I'll do whatever you say. I just want to go home. Damien? Uh, yeah? Can I speak to you upstairs for a sec? Well, of course you can. [ Chimes ringing with wind ] [ Knocking ] Hi Susan. Hi. I saw you on the news. Uh, I'm sorry. If you're busy I can come back. Oh, no, no, no. Come on in. Come on in. Chad was just leaving. Yeah. I'm gonna field some calls. I'll check in on you later. Yeah, ok. I'll be free. Teri's here. Ok. So you still haven't heard anything, huh? No. But look. Christy left this. The necklace that Frank gave her. She never takes this off. Never. Where... where did you find it? Right here. She left it on purpose. Unless the kidnappers left it as a warning. Well, if it was a warning do you think it was a really good idea speaking with the media? Well, I'm not gonna do nothing. I understand, I... I just can't believe someone could have taken her while I was gone. Oh, honey, don't be so hard on yourself. They were stalking you. They were waiting for you to leave. Thanks, Sue. Excuse me, I'm gonna go use the bathroom. Sure. You know, I just can't believe that, like, no one's reached out me for a ransom or anything. I mean, that's just... makes this different from all the other kidnappings, you know? Well, no news is good news, right? Yeah, I hope so. [ Doorbell rings ] Is someone here? [ Doorbell rings again ] [ Doorbell rings again ] [ Sighs ] Did you really think the media show was gonna help? I had to do something. All you've done is caused panic. Maybe we should panic, John. They're taking our children! Yeah, Sue, it's made it harder for us to track down real leads with all the false calls and- Wait a second. I thought you didn't have any leads. We do on the Whitmore girl. We found a torched stolen car in an empty lot. Someone said they saw that exact vehicle driving around the neighbourhood that Ashley Whitmore was last seen in. We also feel that we may have found what looks to be her back pack in the trunk. Anything else? Yeah. Tire tracks from another vehicle near the burned car. We also found what looks to be traces of red ash in those tracks. Red ash? Wait a second. Frank wrote about red ash in his notes. I remember. I thought maybe that- Oh, sorry, I... Oh, this is um, Teri, the neighbour. Babysitter. Right. Sounds like you two have a lot to talk about. I'll just be next door if you need me. Oh my god! Sue, what is it? What is it? "Stop looking for your daughter or we will kill her!" Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Come here. Here. Let me get you some water. [ Gasping ] Sue. Sue, it's gonna be ok. She wasn't lying about her mother. There was a big gallery opening at Baker Sculptures the other night. Hmm. Babe? If we could get our hands on that kind of money we could really disappear for good. She can identify us, Kendra. If she lives, we're dead. Are you kidding me? Yeah, I'm well aware. But we can still get the money if we're smart about it. We could, like, take the money in exchange for clues to the location where they could find her. And I mean, but that point she won't be breathing anymore. We'll already be in Mexico or Switzerland. Just you and me and a bag of money. What about Teri? Oh, god. What about Teri? Sorry, Wade. Your sister's a psycho bitch. I hate the way she treats us. Like she's so superior because of her education. If it wasn't for her connections we would have never found those students in the first place. Wade, if she hadn't killed Frank Baker we wouldn't be facing life sentences. Let's do it. I'm gonna need to use your phone, ok? I'm gonna take it down and have the guys at the lab trace this text. Do me a favour. Just leave this to the professionals. I promise you I will find her. Like you found Frank's killers. Sue... [ sobbing ] [ Sobbing ] This is getting way too dangerous for you and Christy. Maybe you should lay down. Rest for a while. Yeah. I just... I think it's so strange that the kidnappers are not asking for a ransom. Doesn't that seem wrong to you? There's a lot wrong, but just let the cops figure it out. Ok? [ Phone ringing ] See? We're not monsters. Thank you. You're welcome. Come on, eat up. When you're done we're gonna shoot your little video for your mommy. Sue, we got a lead. The cops got a call from a guy who works in a gas station. He caught Christy's picture on the news and thinks he may have seen someone matching her description. The police are going to interview him but I want to head there now and beat them to it. Well, can you pick me up on the way? I really don't think that's a good idea. Well, I am looking at red ash that wasn't here before. Didn't Frank mention something about red ash in his notes? He did. And where was that gas station? It's near Highway 58. Uh, on the way to the national forest. I loved going there as a kid. There's red dirt all over the place. Wait a minute. Are you telling me that you think the kidnappers were at your house? I know they were! I'll be there in 15. Ok, ok, let's go. Come on, let's do this. Let's go. You are our million dollar baby. And I'll tell everyone you guys wore masks the whole time so I couldn't identify you. No you won't. So what do you want me to say then? Hey. Can I help you? Yeah. Are you the one who called about the missing girl? Uh, yeah, but I already talked to the police about it. Well, now you can talk to us. This is the girl's mother. Is this the one you saw? I- I didn't get a great look, but I think so. The people she was with were calling her Jenny. No. Do you remember what they looked like? What kind of vehicle they drove up in? It was a white van. Older one. Coulda used a wash. Did you catch the license plate? Not really. But if it was her she's with this sketchy guy with a beanie and this pretty redhead. She bought some ice cream and used the bathroom. Ice cream? Are you sure? Oh yeah. I made a comment about her sweet tooth. What flavour was it? I was kinda more looking at the girl than the flavour. Uh, it might have been chocolate something. Chocolate chip mint. It's her favourite. Ok Sue, but a lot of people like chocolate chip mint. It doesn't prove they were here. You said she used the bathroom. Yeah. The bathroom's busted. She used the Port-a-Potty around the side. [Susan] Just the redhead? I thought so, but when she got back to the van the Jenny girl was with her and that's when she fell. That's when I saw her. Oh. I... I think she dropped this. Is that Christy's? No, she doesn't use this brand or this colour. Where's the Port-a-Potty? [Clerk] Around the side. [Chad] Is there anything else you can remember? [Kendra] Hey. What about this tree? [Wade] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good, good. - Christy, go over there. - Ok, go. [Kendra] Go, go, go. [Wade] Good girl. Ok... Now just tell your mom what needs to happen. Hi, mom. It's me. I've been kidnapped and they want one... - [coughing] - [Kendra] Hey... Hey. Hey! Are you ok? I think I- [ coughing ] Swallowed a bug. [Wade] What, you need some water? Watch her. Hey! Don't tell me what to do. Shut your mouth. [ Coughing ] Wait! She's getting away! Dammit! Run! Christy! Get back here! Christy, stop! I said stop! Christy. Come on, sweetheart. I just wanna chat. Keep going! I'll head her off. Christy! Get back here! Christy, stop! Now! [ Phone ringing ] [ Phone ringing ] Yeah. No, nothing. Keep looking, she couldn't have gone far. [ Phone ringing ] Yeah. Is it done? Almost. What does "almost" mean? Not quite, very nearly, not far from? Cut the crap, Wade! I need to hear that she's dead and that's all. You know, if you keep screwing this up I am gonna rip your head off and stick it right up your- Don't worry, we'll find her. [ Screams ] That's it, I am coming up there and taking care of this myself! Bitch. Is there anything else you can remember? Anything out of the ordinary? No. Wait a minute, what side of the pump did they use? I remember that. Here, I'll show you. Oh my god, she was here! Christy was here! Look, right up there. How do you know it was Christy that wrote that? Because that's her expression. Look, same colour. Ok. Ok, uh, so let's say Christy was here and she- she left in that van we still don't know where they went. I saw them head east. And you saw ash in the tracks? Yeah, yeah. Near the pumps. That's red ash right there. Yeah, the stuff is all over the national forest off Highway 58. It's not far away. Right. This is exactly what was in front of my house. Dirt. I'm gonna go back to work. Thanks. Ok, look. This is great, but this still doesn't really narrow our search that much. No, but the ice cream does. How? Well, it takes about a half hour for a quart of ice cream to melt. According to my daughter it takes 42 minutes exactly. What makes you think they didn't just eat it in the car? No, you buy an ice cream bar or, like, a pint if you're gonna eat it in the car. A quart of ice cream is heading to a freezer. [ Muffled voice mail plays ] What? At 6:34 Christy was safe at home. [ Recording ] ...here when you arrived. You said that she went to study, you went back to your house for 15 or 20 minutes and when you got back here she was gone, is that correct? I didn't even know she left until Susan called and asked me to check on her. She was blasting her music all night so I just figured that she was still up there. And that was what time? Around 9:30. Son of a... [ groans ] The national park forest is just ahead. There's few private parcels of land around there but it's a big area. I know. I have some great memories as a little girl. My parents had a cabin up here. Hey, we'll find her soon. [ Muffled screaming ] Like bees to honey. They sent a threat. What? You didn't tell me that. I know. What'd it say? It said "stop looking for your daughter or we'll kill her". Sue, why didn't you tell me? Is there anything else I should know? Despite what it seems like I'm almost reaching closure over Frank's death and I'm really, really grateful for you. These abductions must be very hard on you, Miss Simmons. What do you mean? Well, being a school administrator you must know all these children very well. Well, not personally. But you do keep files and records on them, right? I mean, them and their families. Well, of course. It's part of the job description. Uh, you said you had some questions about last night? Yes, I do. Um, oh. Ok. Just give me a... it's- it's actually something that you said earlier when I was taking your statement. What about? Well, you said that when- when Christy called her mom at 6:34 that you were in the house, am I correct? Well, I wasn't looking at the time, but yes, around then I was going over my student transcripts and Christy was in her room. But you heard her. I mean, you heard her music blasting. She was... to the best of your knowledge in the house at that time, correct? Yes. I came back, Susan had called the house phone, I checked on Christy, she was gone. We've already been through this numerous times. Well, you know, see, actually it's-it's... it's what was on Susan's phone, the message that Christy left on Susan's cell phone. Here, why don't you um... take another listen to that. [ Plays recording ] It just sounds like a bunch of noise. If you ask me, Christy did just pocket dial her mom by accident. Perhaps. See, I've been listening to it over and over trying to figure this out, something came to me. It's not what I was hearing on the recording, it's what I was not hearing. What do you mean? There's no music in the background. Hmm? There's no loud blasts, no bass, no vocals at all, so if she were blasting her music during the call in her room like you said, wouldn't we hear it on the message? I suppose we would. Mmmhmm. You kidnapped those girls, didn't you? And you killed Frank Baker. [ Groans ] [ Gun shot ] [ Moans ] If your theory about ice cream is correct we're... it's been almost 40 minutes. You're doubtful. I'm just concerned. Where is it? There's a few cabins up here, just slow down. What're you doing? Just a hunch. Hang on a second. Wait. Chad, what is it? Hang on. There's some tire tracks that look similar to the ones we saw at the gas station. What? See? Oh my god. They go up this way. There's gotta be a cabin on this property. Yeah, I hope so. Oh god, please. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. It's Christy's! Look, look. Let's go. Wait, wait, wait. We should call the police and report this. How long is that gonna take? Probably too long. Yeah. Ok. I didn't know you had a gun. There's a lot you still don't know about me. Ok. Hey. [ Groaning ] What happened to you? The brat hit me with a rock. I sprained my ankle. Ok, I got her, she's in the van. Let's go. She'll be out for a while. Ok, come on, we gotta do this. [ Phone ringing ] [ Groans ] Don't worry Teri, we got her. Tell me she's dead. She's dead. Finally. What about the file? Chill. We're gonna get rid of them in a minute. Don't. I need to plant them as evidence on a dead, dirty cop. Just be there when I arrive. And keep on the lookout for Susan and her lawyer friend. They went to interview some gas station guy who might have seen Christy. You two know anything about that? No, we were careful. No. We were good. We're-yeah. I hope so. For all our sake. Woah. It's kind of hot when you lie to your sister. I didn't lie. She'll be dead by the time Teri gets here. All we gotta do is shoot the video with her lying in the back. We still have to see her breathing. Yeah, and then we kill her. Let's go. That's right. Hey, what about the mom? One thing at a time. Come on. Wait a minute, Susan. What's your plan? Just go through the front door and ask if they kidnapped your daughter? No. We'll pretend we're lost and we ran out of gas. No way, they threatened you! They could recognize you. Let me-let me go. Ok. [ Knocking ] Hello, anyone home? [ Knocking ] No one home. What do we do now? That's breaking and entering. I didn't break anything, it was open. Come on. Christy? Christy? It's mom. I don't see any signs who's here. Oh my god. Franks notes! You were right. I knew it! Where's my daughter? Christy! Christy! Woah, woah, we've got company. Come on. What do we do? Uh, just stay here, let me handle this. All you have to do is breathe. In and out. Out and in. Stop right there. Get your hands up slowly. Don't move. [ laughs ] Kendra spotted your car on the side of the road. Who are you with? I'm alone. Oh really? Where's your girlfriend? I left her behind. It's too dangerous. Is she dead? She will be. So will you. [ Groans ] Let's get him in the van. We'll get rid of them together. Well, he probably called the cops. You're right. Go get the files, we'll have to meet Teri somewhere safer. We're on our way. [ Groans ] No. No, no, no. Wade! The notes are gone! Wade! Hey! Help me. I can't... [ moans ] What are you doing? I got... What? J- ju... Who? The mom... The mom? The mom?! The mom?! Ugh. [ Groaning ] Christy? Christy? Christy, are you ok? Yeah. Mom? Honey. Oh. Everything's gonna be ok now, honey. You found my message at the gas station? [ laughs ] Yeah. Your mom found all the clues. With your support. They got my gun. I got it back. Mom, watch out! Get out of the van, Susan! You just couldn't stay at home and do something helpful like overdose. You had to make this difficult. Just like Frank. Teri? Why? For the money. And to avoid prison. This was never personal. Maybe not for you! We make a good team, huh? Yeah. You nearly ran me over. I knew you'd get out of the way. Team work. I love you, mom. [ Police radio chatter ] How's Christy? How are you? I heard if the bullet was a couple inches to the right you wouldn't be here. I'm so sorry I ever doubted you, John. It's fine, Sue. Really. Thank god it's over. You should have these. Mom! Oh, honey. I knew you'd find me. You're amazing. You're my mom. You have to say that. No, I don't. I'm just happy you guys never gave up on me. We thought you might want this back. You found it! [Chad] Yep. Oh, sure did. Here, let's put this where it belongs. There you go. So you sure you still wanna be a cop after all this? No, I have a different job in mind. Oh, really? Which is? Hostage negotiator. She's joking. She's joking. Nope. Nope. [laughs]
