Thank you for calling John F. Kennedy, best kept secret in the Newark Public Schools. How may I help you? So... have a look. Hi, Quran, how are you? Fine. How was your New Year? Yeah? Good, I see you smiling. You must have had a good year. - Bianca, how you doing? - Good. How was your New Year? You slept a lot? So did I. I'm on this side, let me get it. Okay, thank you. Pull, pull, pull! So you don't have to walk back, you can ride back. You're welcome. ...One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Have a great day. Happy New Year. Good morning, JFK. Let's hear it for JFK! Welcome back to 2011! We made it another year, isn't that great? Robert, it's good to see you! Say hi. Hi... - Miss... - Miss... - Mino. - Mino. Good job, that's good talking. - Good morning. - Good morning. Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh! Relax. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. Can I get a kiss? Thank you. I'm not a doctor. I'm not trying to look for a cure. But if I could teach you how to take care of yourself, how to express yourself, or just get some type of language out of you, where you could be able to voice for yourself. These are the things that we really need to work with. Ready? Read. "The." All right, high-ten! Excellent! You did that by yourself, too. Do you want something for that? I didn't understand that. Do you want something for that? - Yes. - You have to say it louder. If you don't speak louder, nobody's going to ever give you what you want. So, do you want something? - Yes. - Yes! - Yes! - Okay, what do you want? Cookie. - Cookie? - Cookie! Oh, that was nice and loud. Sure, you can have a cookie. But that was beautiful. You get a big cookie for that, too. Ra-ra, look at me! Is this our friend? Yeah. Rahamid got a fear of plants and we try to desensitize him. Outside, he won't go by the trees. Okay, lesson's over. Okay. Could you put this back for me? Yeah. Are you going to put it back? - Ouch. - Ouch what? Do you want to put it back for me or no... yes or no? - No. - You want me to do it? - Yes. - Okay, I'll do it. - What is your name? - Erik. Very good. My name is Janet. - Erik. - My... My name is Erik. - I live in Montclair. - I live in Montclair. - No. I live in Montclair. - I... I I... - Live... - Live... in... Orange. Very good. Up, up, up, up, up! Come on! Good. Up. Good! I've been teaching for over 20 years. I had several kids graduate before. But this time it's different because my entire class is graduating. So, we're going to talk about transition. We're going to have a discussion about what happens with our students once they leave here, and particularly since your entire class is graduating. One of the biggest problems that we have for our students with autism is, there's not a lot of resources post-high school. So... they have like a day recreational program where the kids just come and do activities, and then they have a work program. But it's not anything that I would consider, you know, a standard, traditional job. Do they have any live-in programs? Oh, yeah, uh... It's very private. And you've got to pay. And most of our kids wouldn't be able to pay. - Oh, it's private. - Yeah. You know, when you graduate school, you're no longer a student, they call you a "consumer." So they allow the consumer to guide and direct what they want to do. I'm saying "consumers" 'cause that's what they're going to become. I know, those consumers... It's just... young adults? They go from being students to consumers. Sounds like a product instead of a person. Well, you start talking about these agencies, we've got to use their language, because that's the language they use. So what we'll do is we'll set a schedule. I have to call these places. I want to definitely get started in February, because, you know... Can we start and just let me visit the places? - You want to visit without them? - Right. That way, when I talk to them, I could suggest this for this and that reason. Without knowing or been there, I don't even know what to say. No, you can come. And let's say, if we want to do the first or the second week... Rah, what are you supposed to say if that's your coat? - This is my coat. - My coat. You gonna let him take your coat? -My coat. What are you gonna do? Go get it! - Whose coat is this? Whose coat? Huh? Whose coat is this? Mr. D's coat? - It's my coat. - That's your coat? Walk out the door with it. My coat. -My coat. That's right, get him! Run! Say, "Mr. D!" - My coat. - This your coat? - My... Okay. He said, "Bye, everybody." - Bye, everybody. Bye-bye. See you tomorrow. Okay, see you tomorrow, buddy. What's up, man? My man. There you go. 1... 1... 2... 2... Come on, 3... 3... Come on, 4... 4... Come on, 5... 5... Come on, 6. Keep it close, come on. Come on, 6... 7. Come on. 8. Come on. 9. - 10. - Good job. My man, high-five. Yes, sir, yes, sir. First of all, I had to accept that Quran didn't have a problem, I had the problem. You know what I'm saying? Because see, I wanted him to be a different person than he is. Wanted him to be normal. Wanted him to be "normal." Right, you know what I'm saying? So, now, once I accepted him for him being who he is... You know what I'm saying? Things just became easier. We have a good foundation. We've been through a lot of things and stuff like, you know, and we go through it together. It's just that, you know, my objective is for Quran to be able to, uh... What? Not get lost. You know, just sit in a room and be isolated from everybody. You know? And end up in an institution, dealing with whatever. The state. So, we have to be in the best position so that Quran can receive the best quality of life possible. Mm-hmm. Not what we ask him to do. - What does he like to do? - What does he like to do? It's just that, you know, who can we depend on outside of ourselves... Mm-hmm. What can we do to get through this next level, you know what I'm saying? Robert was being neglected by my sister. She couldn't... She couldn't handle it. Because of addiction. Drugs. He was living with my mother, and my sister was there with my mother, too, but my sister had went to jail. And when she went to jail, my mother could no longer care for Robert. And Robert was undernourished. And he was really really in a bad shape. And Robert was undernourished. And he was really really in a bad shape. And I went in and I took Robert. Robert was weighing like 86 pounds when I got him. Um... He had a very, very peculiar smell on him. He was eating... eating his flesh. And now Robert no longer eats his skin... He eats his food. And he weighs 125 pounds, I believe now. Yeah, and he's doing wonderful. My concern is what's going to happen after he gets out of school. You know, he just needs some outlet so he can and so he can be around the peoples that he can relate to. His case manager hasn't called me once and say, "We have a program for Robert. You know, go and see if you can get him in there or take these steps to get in there." Nothing. Nothing. And I gave up. It's like I'm not reaching out anymore. I just stopped reaching out. They don't call this a foster home, but they call it a, um... therapeutic home. If you don't have a special need, then you wouldn't be part of the program that we're in. How many kids have been here? 10? Out of all of the children that we mentor, he's really the best of all. He's a blessing to us. Right, Erik? Yes, Dad. See, I can always get a "yes" out of him, so that's good. Yeah, when he first came here, he was very... I guess, shy. This is the first time he's been in a program like this because he came from his mother's home. So he was kind of shy. He would not interact much with us. He would stay in his room mostly, you know. In the book, it said that he was living with his mother and brother. And that his mother was ill and unable to take care of him. I think she was concerned with her son and wanted to make sure that he was being taken care of because she couldn't. I commend her for that. But he does have visits with his mother once a week. Which he enjoys. He looks forward to that. - Tremendously. - Right. As far as him living on his own, I don't know. During school, he has job training. Like they have a job cleaning the church pews, that kind of stuff. Okay. When you finish that, come back up, Robert. Matthew. Keep working, please. Thank you. Come on. You can do it. You touched it yesterday. Come on. You can do it. You went through the other one. Right. Are you going to walk through this? - Yeah. - Okay. Good. Yay! Yay! Very good! Yay! Excellent! You did it! Very good, very good. Now, look... Look at Ms. Mino. Very good. Somebody has to hire you after graduation. If you lose your ticket, what's happening? You walk. That was what was holding him up, but she's been in constant contact with him. This is Janet Mino. She's a teacher at our school. She was Tesean's teacher. - Ohh! - Is he here? - He's here. - Yeah, he's upstairs. Oh, I would love to see him. You want to start downstairs? - That's fine. - Okay. This way, please. That's our arts and crafts area. Marlene, maybe you can... We make this with the consumers. Wherever we sell, we pay. Okay, this way. - Thank you very much. - Thank you, Marlene. One more floor. A computer room? No, this is our production room. Where we do subcontract work, sorting cable wires for Cable Vision. Some of the people are doing data and some of them wires. We just finished with the paint. The paint is outside. - Right. - And we also do mulch work. Mm-hmm. Okay, thanks. Hi! Tesean, show them your world. Tesean, give me a hug! Stand up. Give me a hug! Yoga stand. Up. Bring your feet up. Yeaaaah! I told you he would remember you. At first he was like, "What are you doing here?" I remember you. You do that nicely. Ooh-ooh! Thank you. It's so good to see you. It's good to see you. It's good to see you. Talk. Good... No, good... No, pfft. Good, good. Talk. Stop. Stop. Stop. Yeah. Nice! Nice! You better put that fist down. Yeah. Bye. Bye. So all day, all he do is piecework? He does piecework on... Yeah, basically, because it's a work-orientated program. That's why Tesean's mom wanted this program. And we're constantly looking for additional work. Right. We don't like to sit and do the same thing all the time. Yeah. I know the feeling. There is so much more in Tesean. Tesean was verbal. Um... It's like... factory work. And that's what they do in the works program. I understand that. Unless they have skills, and you have to remember, the work program is a government program, and the emphasis is on working. That's it. Exactly, but, to me, the children with autism, we understand, are special need children, so we're going to give them a work program but we're also going to give them... We're going to mix that up because we're going to give them... Oh, what word am I looking for? Uh, their social recreation? We've got to give them a light. - It's up to us... - No, but... To me... this is just my... I hear what you're saying. It's up to us to find them activities within so they can have a full day, so when they go home, they had a full day of different activities, work where they got paid. - That is not life after school. - It could be. I find my own recreational activities. Right, but these are special need! Then you're treating them as if they're so different, and that's not right, I don't agree. I don't agree with you, either, 'cause all you want to do is make them little robots working and then go home. - No. - That's what you're saying. That is a family and an individual responsibility. - But we know... - And the place that you work is not necessarily going to provide that for you. You know what, it's not going to be drastically different and they're not going to lend themselves, and that's why it's important that when they are with us and in the school system, that we do that as much as possible. We do, but with children with autism, if you stop doing it, they're going to stop. They're going to withdraw within themself. They're only telling you the reality of life. No, that's your reality. As much as we'd like it nice and sweet and fluffy, , that's not real life for anybody. What's happening this month? Black history. Very good. Quran. What are we celebrating? Black history. Black history. And how we're going to do our writing today is make a timeline like we did for Martin Luther King. We're going to do one for Oprah, too. Okay. We're waiting for you, Robert. Hmm. Robert could read, Robert could talk. But then something happened. I don't know what happened. Everything he did, he started to decline. He just shut off totally. Robert, I don't want to go backwards, but you're having a little trouble. Okay, everybody catch up to Erik. I need a break. I know you need a break. Waaaah. You gotta get moving. Stand up, move! You're all tight, tight. Loosen up! Yeah, there you go! Shake out your fingers. Shake it out! Shake out those fingers. Shake 'em out! There you go! What are we learning about today? Oprah Winfrey! Oprah Winfrey. Very good, and who did we learn about yesterday? President... O... Obama. Very good! And then who did we learn about Monday? Monday. - Martin... - Martin Luther King. Yaaay! "Conversational partners often elicit verbal language by prompting Erik. His ability to respond properly is improving," and I've seen that from last year. "Erik has been able to meet the goals, answering simple WH questions, although repetition of the questions may be required to minimize echolalic responses." Okay, so that's his overall speech information. Can you tell me some things he's doing at home now? Well, his goals this year is to make his bed with maybe one verbal prompt, to make his bed every day. We are visiting different sites for after graduation. I just know they have so much in them, and I just don't want them to go to a place and be forgotten and just go robotic, you know what I mean? Not like one of those state programs, just come in and sit till 5:00, eat your lunch, go home. None of the students, the young adults, in that type of place, right, Erik? Yes, Mino. We've got to find a place that fits you, right, Erik? Yes. After graduation, I see Erik working, as long as he has a job coach. - I'm good with that. - Okay. One thing I saw, that his mother wanted that they might be together? Do you have any information on that? No one has told me anything. For a while, he wasn't seeing his mother 'cause she was sick. Really ill, and she didn't want him to see her in that condition, but she's improved and now they're starting to let him visit again. But I don't know what the future is. They don't tell me. Hi. Hey! Yeah, come over here. Stop going for the food first. How you been? Fine. Let me see your mustache? Ooh, you got a thick mustache this time. What do you do for the dang camera besides coloring? I color. You want to color or do a picture? Color. Okay. You do that. He was taken while I was in the hospital and that was 2006, when I had my first surgery on my foot. He was at the apartment with my mother and his older brother. The older brother was doing things that he shouldn't have been doing. The all-night parties and, you know, all the people coming in and out all times at night, that type of thing, while Erik was there. And at the time, the case worker came by and saw everything that was going on. So he came to the hospital. He thinks Erik should be removed from that situation. I can see the caseworker's point about Erik being in jeopardy. And that's when he took him. That's when he first went into foster care. He didn't like it, but I was trying to do the best thing for Erik, but I didn't want Erik to be in jeopardy. I regret getting sick like I did. I mean, this guy has been with me ever since he was born. And to have him taken like that... it's tough and hard for me to get over. What color is that fallen flower? Yellow. I was looking at that talk box, what do you call it? I don't see how you carry around something that bulky. No, no, this is how you teach them. But then it goes into "tap to talk." Quran has a cell phone, so he wouldn't carry this around. He would use his cell phone. And then the phone, whatever he types in, would say it. - Okay. - Then he would hear that. It would reinforce the language again. - And you customize it. - Hmm. The way Quran would talk, or how we talk. How we talk. Our lingo. Our lingo, you know what I'm saying? "Yo, man, can I get three of those?" - Had a good day? - Yeah. Did you say, "See you later, Ms. Mino"? What?! - Miss who? Who's that? What did you say? See you later... Look at nose. Look at nose. Mm-hmm. See you later... - What?! - See you later... What's my name? Miss... Mino. Okay, see you later. And make him do it hisself. Which way you go, Quran? You dropped something on the floor. Good morning, Matthew. How are you? I'm fine. Would you like to say hi to a friend? Choose one... who are you going to say hi to? Kareem? Hello. What do you say? Say, "Hi, Matthew." Hi, Matthew. Rahamid, what do you like to play with? I want to play with a ball. - You like playing with a ball. - Yes. What do you do with the ball? I want to play with a ball. You like that, huh? Robert. Come here. Let's try you on this. Type this on here. Type that. You've got to look at the word "hope." Robert's been absent 62 times. And if you miss a day with Robert, it's like starting all over again. Robert. Type. Stop it. Let's go. Type. Uh, I was diagnosed September the 9th with colon cancer. Robert is with his mother, and his mother is attending to him now, 'cause the doctor said, "The first time you get the chemo, it's going to make you kind of sick." But, uh... I don't trust his mother. His mother's not really stable. She don't have no house of her own. His mother's on drugs. She don't have no income. What is it, 209? Or 206? 207. Down the corridor this way. - Okay? - Uh-huh. Thank you. Um... you all need a will. You need a living will. What if something happens to you and your child is disabled, and what's going to happen to that child? You have to have everything down in writing. Are you familiar with how to do a proposal? - Yeah, you just say... - A proposal? That has to be done in February or October. Why? Because that's their rules and regulations. How do you apply for anything if they don't tell you, if you don't have the information? No, 'cause you always have to contact them and say, "This is what I want to apply for." You have to always contact them. It's messed up. You cannot let nothing slide with them, honey, 'cause they will not return your call or anything else. Sometimes go down there and look 'em in the face, eye to eye, and they'll do something. You have to have chemo for two days a week? - No, have to have chemo... - Just two days? For six months. So... Don't look at me like that, don't do that. - No, I'm not. - I don't want that look. It's a concern, though. Go ahead. Okay. After that gets set up and we get stable with that, I think I'm going to go and get Robert and bring him back home, but the doctor wanted to make sure that I'd be okay. Robert... when is he coming back to school, though? I'm going to call my sister up tonight and I'm going to let her know that she have to call the bus and have the bus pick him up, because he'll be back to school maybe tomorrow, maybe Friday, or first thing Monday. I'm just concerned 'cause he's been out. And I called you but I thought you were sick or something. No. I have a lot of doctor's appointments. Oh, okay. Just a lot of doctor's appointments. Good morning, birthday... man. Young man, yeah! How old are you? 20! Yeah, so, what are we going to do today? - Uh, cake. - We got a party! - Party! - Yes! - And who's coming? - Erik's birthday. Right, and who's coming for Erik's birthday? - Mommy! - Yaaay! Card. Wow! - Nice. - Nice! You gotta open it. I know she's going to come, she always comes, but I'm thinking maybe I should have just got a cake, just in case. But I know she's going to come. Sit, Erik! Sit down! Sit down!!! Yay! Erik wins!! - Erik wins! That was cheating! Mino? - Yes. - Can you pick up your phone? Oh, okay. How far is she? Oh, she isn't going to... Erik, darling. That was mommy called. Right, and you know what happened? They never came to pick her up. So, she's going to come another day, okay? Come a day. Then mommy will bring the Carvel ice cream another day, okay? All right, hold on. Here, Erik. Hi, Mommy. Hi. Happy Birthday. Thank you, Mommy. Goodbye, Mommy. Sing "Happy Birthday," Mommy. Sing "Happy Birthday," Mommy. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Mommy ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪♪ - All right, good job. - Good job. Good job, Erik. Yay! Erik! - What is that, Erik? - It's cookies. - What kind of cookies? - That's okay. - Cookie cake. - Cookie cake! - All right! - Yeah! You happy? Mmm. Mmm. How your cake taste? Good. - It taste like a cookie? - A cookie. A cookie with M&M's? - M&M's. - M&M's What's the name of the place we're going? - The WAE Center. - The WAE Center? W-a-e. One more time, let's reach out. And then another deep breath in. The only criteria to come to the WAE Center is that you'd like to be here. We have quite a number of people with autism. And how do they work out? Oh, they're phenomenal. As you're here... That's the population that I work with. So that's the population I'm looking to place and I'm trying to find something functional for them that they're not going to be sitting around, so that's why I'm interested in the art, because the creativity... Nobody sits around. - And that's what I like. Everybody's busy all the time. And they're doing things that they want to do. And because of that, they're happy. We're culturally, racially, religiously different. Everybody, we have every group, and that's what we want. This is the real world. This is the real world. And we want it to be that way. This is our art studio. On Tuesday afternoons, we have still-life or portraiture. Like Monday's a bit of a different class. We have sculpture. How many students come in at one time? Not students. I gotta... Everybody here is a member of the WAE Center. Okay, I like that. We have different types of sessions - one-on-one sessions where it's one facilitator with one artist. We have group classes we've been starting, expanding on that. There's no good, bad, or right or wrong. It's, what do you want to do? Is this exactly how you want it? This is great! Okay, we're going to go into Circus Arts and see what's going on. Carefully, and you're going to pass it to Mark. Quietly, quietly. You can do it, Mark. I have faith in you. Nice, good job. Excellent. Whoa! All right! Very good! - Wonderful! - Great job! - Great job. - Really great. You're lovely. What's your name? - My name is Janet. - Janet, God bless you. - You're lovely. - Thank you. - Did you enjoy the hoop thing? - Yes, I really enjoyed that. I love your... I love your, uh... your hair. Oh, thank you. They're dreads. Yeah, ye... I never saw dreads before. - No? - No. Totally radical. - Oh, thank you. - Okay. This is what a schedule looks like. This tells you all the different classes that we have. But, you know, even with that, how do you make it work for everyone? The WAE Center is a good place, but their hours are lousy. They don't offer transportation. You don't understand, I should get paid overtime. I'm always... I tell you, always, weekend, I'm always thinking about them. I'm like constantly, "Well, what if I do that?" You know, you're trying different things. It's just... You just gotta be in my head for a little while, you'll be like, wow! This is for Quran Key. This is for his psychological testing that he's having today. They're just going to see where he's at. Um... His father wanted it. So I guess his father wants to see if he's grown development-wise on, like, this is like his self-care, self-direction. They got social, his work. They ask about communication. His functional academics, school living. So this is my first time doing this. Good morning, Ms. Thompson. Good morning. Good morning, Erik. Good morning, Quran. Ohh! Hi, y'all. Go on, you can get up! I love you. Yaaay! How was that, Erik? Mommy's here. Yes, and we're going to get ready. Carvel ice cream. Yeah? Good! What else we got. Mommy got everything! You still into racing cars? Racing cars, Mommy. Nice. I'm over here. Hot Wheels, Mommy. Hot Wheels what? A race-car video game, Mommy. Why do you gotta be a comedian? Go on, take it easy. I'm a fan, Mommy. Fans, they do it. You've gotta come more often. We get so much language out of him. Well, Erik's going to be 21. What is his plans for living situation? Did they say anything about you... Well, he can't live with me right now 'cause I'm in a senior citizens disabled building. I'd have to get a 2-bedroom. Then I'm not too sure he'd sleep in his own bedroom. Because when he's around me, he's closer than my shadow. I wanted to ask you about this guy here. Mm-hmm. What was he going to be doing after he graduates? Right. We're looking into that now. We're looking for different programs for him. And we've visited some spots, but so far that's where we're at, we're just looking. Uh-huh. Is that milk? Yes, Mommy. You're finished. The plan is for me to get Erik a job at Burger King. 'Cause that's where Erik wants to work after graduation. Hi, my name is Janet Mino. I work in Newark. I work at JFK. I just come because I have a young adult with autism. And his dream is to work at Burger King. But a coach, somebody have to be here with them. Yes, he will have a job coach with him, or a life coach. Only three days in the week? Only three days, and it would be in the morning. Maybe from 9:00 to 11:00. Is that good? - That's good. - That's good? Erik's dream! He's going to be so happy. Burger King hat, working. I'm going to send one of my teacher assistants to be his job coach, and his transportation is going to be with the bus from the school. Who wants to go first? You get five tries to get it in the basket. Ohhh! He got three in a row. Oh, that's one! Ohhh! What? What's up? What are y'all two doing there? Ra-ra, your turn. Your turn to shoot, come on. Throw it. You gotta look at the hoop. - Throw it. - Shoot 'em in there. Oh-ho-ho! Why did you hit me?! Yo. Come on. Go. - You wanna sit here? - Yeah. Say, "That's my spot, man, I was sitting there." - I was sitting there. - Tell him, not me. - I was sitting there... - Ra-ra. Ra-ra. Tell him! Tell him! I was sitting there. You have a right... - Yeah, yes. - Tell him! Tell him. Stop! His psych test? How was it? Well, we'll talk about it later. It's going to be a long conversation. - Was it good? - No, it wasn't good. I mean, it's expected, but, you know... I don't even go by those tests. I know, you can't. Well... 'Cause how are they going to test him? Huh? If he do... That's what's confusing me, 'cause if you're going to test Quran, if you don't know Quran, you don't have no reinforcers or be able to get language out of Quran, how is it a fair assessment of Quran? Like, if you say, "Quran," you show Quran how to put a stamp on a paper, and then he's talking about something else, then they say, "Quran, place the stamp on the paper," he said Quran wasn't able to put the stamp in the right place. That's according to the report. Little things like that that concern concentration... Quran... You know what? That's interesting. Because how you gonna... with him... if you know working with kids with autism, it's got to be a consistent thing. If he never put a stamp in a proper place on an envelope, you do it one time and you just change the subject, he didn't learn that program. So how he's going to be expected to do that? Okay, I gotta go. I'll see you later on this evening, Quran, all right? - All right. - All right. My man. So... you gotta go. Yeah, I gotta go to a doctor's appointment. I'll talk to you later. - Okay, Quran, I'll see y'all. - All right. You know, uh... it seems like he reversed instead of... progressed, you know what I'm saying? He regressed on some of the things that I know that he's able to do. They got away from the academics and started just focusing on life skills. Uh... Now, I agreed to that. You know, but now I'm not so sure that that decision I made is... was a good one. Oh, that face. What's the matter, Robby Rob? Do some work. He's cursing me out. Do some work. Why are you so mad? Okay, okay, Robert. Don't bite me. Wait, wait, wait. Robert, Robert. What happened? What happened? He don't wanna do nothing. Here, talk to me. What happened? Relax. Let's go to here. Let's start with here. You have to look, though. You can push this... Feelings. Okay. Sick. You feel sick? Do you want to go to the nurse? Robert, do you want to go to the nurse? Maybe. Maybe? You want to go wash your face again and relax? Aaaaaa! Ahhh! Aaaaaa! Look who's here. You traitor! Come here, Tesean. Come here, come here. Take your coat off. This isn't... Tesean. That's your teacher! - You don't wanna be here? - That's your teacher. - We are so happy to see you. - They're happy to see you. Do me a favor, just sit with Robert, he's upset. We're going to ignore Tesean until Tesean get it together. - And we're gonna take you. - Yes, please. And you're going to come this way. Welcome to all of you. Good morning. Good morning. And yet again, we're having another panel discussion on services that are vital and necessary in school as well as once your students leave school in the community. We have the pleasure of having one of our very first of two graduates from the school here in the autism program. Ms. Callie Stansel, who's the parent of Tesean. Good morning, everybody. I'm Callie Stansel and I live in the city of Newark. And I am a parent. And if you would meet Tesean, you would say, "Oh," because he'd come in... "Aaaa-aaaa!" He came in with that this morning. I said, "He's back. Your child is back." They said, "Oh, my God!" But I do thank God for him being here, for that experience that I've had. Okay, if you have any questions, I guess you can ask them later on. It's no longer school, it's work. We want you to think work, to hear the word "work." Everywhere around the building is work. We encourage the parents to say you're coming to work. And that's what we want for our children is that they move on to the next phase in life like any other child. You child would come into the WAE Center and decide that they want to be in theater, they want to be in art, they want to take music class, they want to do yoga, and that schedule would be created for them. Are your programs going to be working on more transportation? You have to pay for it if the state's not going to pay for it. Every place doesn't, and, as they said earlier, "transportation is the key to your successful transitioning." DVR, Vocational Rehab, offers a whole bunch of services. It is a government program, federal and state funded. Our goal is to really just help people be successful, because that's how we're successful. We keep our funding coming in by getting people employed. How could you help an autistic, nonverbal person? We have funding, but it's limited to help the person, really, to get on their feet and to start working. We can't follow them for the rest of their life or anything like that. I'm still asking, what do you have to offer for him? It really depends how independent that person can be. As they graduate, there will be funding. There's a whole process you all have to go through, which is a survey. They'll call you. They're going to ask you about your family member. And you're going to have to do something that you haven't done in your life. You're going to have to tell them all the things that they can't do. So if your child crosses the street on their own, but you're standing on the corner and you tell them when the light turns green, they are not independent. And you have to be able to own that when you have this interview. So next we want to invite Ms. Rosa Albanese from Birchwood, a day program. Birchwood is a medical daycare center for people from 18 years old and up. We have really two programs, one for seniors and the other one for developmental disableds. And for developmental disabled, we try that they have fun. We have a lot of people from this school, and after lunch they can go there... We can pick them up here. And we accommodate according to the disability that they have. We need to know everything so we can help in the right way. And just remember, this is a medical daycare service. Robert, Kareem, and Quran just started going to Birchwood in the afternoon. I wish they would stay until the end of the day and then go to Birchwood. That's not my choice. I don't have no say over that. I don't know what they're doing there, but if they're not working one-on-one with them and not pushing them, they're doing absolutely nothing. I know that. Hi, how are you doing? - Great! How are you? - I'm good. Good. I'm Janet. How are you doing, Kirk? - Nice to meet you, welcome. - Thank you. - Thanks for coming by today. - Thanks for having me. We're going to check out the program if that's all right. So you're going to be the one touring me around? Yes, I will do my best to be the best tour guide. All I've got is my family. I think of them all the time. I think of my family members all the time. So, what do you do after you do that? Move over a little. Can I squeeze in there? Can I squeeze between y'all? Hi, Kareem. Put your hands down. - Hi. - Hi. - How you doing? - Fine. Do your socks go on your hands? No? Where do the socks go? Show me where on the body. Show it. Point to it. Where do Socks go? Where does this go? Right here? So, what goes first? Kareem, let's put this on the side. Yeah, he might get distracted. Look. In the morning time, right? Listen first. Put your hands down. Look at me... In the morning, when you get dressed, what do you put on first? You put on your... What is that? What are those, Kareem? What is it? Where do those go? You put on your pants? Okay. Put the hands down. So, um... I would prefer like if they were interacting, with games and different to bring out more communicating. - Communication with each other. - Sure. Things like that. Um, it is what it is. The spectrum of autism is very wide. So there's some we probably won't be able to handle because we have... So, you wouldn't take children with behaviors? That's not true, no, I'm saying it's case by case. - Case by case? - Yeah. I was just seeing if this is a proper place for my kids. 'Cause I heard this was more for senior citizens. Well, it originally was. So I didn't quite understand. So I said, "Let me come see." But, what the parents are looking for that you offer is the hours. - Yeah. - And the transportation. But the academic part that they don't realize but they need is just communications and life skills. That's what they need. And money management, dealing with knowing that, if I have this money, I can buy this object. With the state, we can't deal with any real money. Because we're a private company... No, but if you had a store and the kids had an opportunity... Even, are you allowed to go out in the community? And...? Walks. Around the neighborhood. Are you allowed to do that? We can't, being a medical day center. I wish we could; there's so many things I'd like... That's a life skill, too. We do the best we can. We go out, show them Central Av. From the end of our parking lot, and do our nature works... We do a lot of special events with them, too. I was just wondering, is there a speech therapist? We don't have a speech therapist now. Want me to show you how? I can teach you real quick. - Yeah. - It's quite simple. If they see the picture of a cookie, they won't associate it with a cookie. You start with one picture of a cookie. Then you actually have the cookie there. That way, they start to understand this is a cookie. And since you don't have a lot of staff, you can do it in a group thing as a game. That's what we would try to do to that. But this is definitely going in the right direction. I think you're doing a good thing. Well, we're working on it. You've figured a lot of different ideas to add different programs and different choices you have here, and make it larger. All the parents are going to come to this place because they've got transportation. That's like the hardest thing. But I would just hate to think that everything that you did all through the years, and then they come back, and if you don't practice anything, you lose it. Quran's higher functioning than adult daycare, which is Birchwood. He's much better than that. I don't recommend that for Quran. I'm not trying to belittle the program. For the right persons, it's okay and it's great. But for someone who has capabilities beyond sitting and playing games and going on trips, they can go beyond that. A lot of parents, they're looking for a baby-sitter. They need a place. Right, and I understand that because they have to work and they have to make a living, so they need something. But they're not looking for quality. Right, and that's what we have to gear them towards, to look for appropriate places that meet their child's needs, not just somewhere to put them for so many hours of the day. Ms. Mino told me, she said, "I'm so mad at you 'cause Quran gotta leave at 12:00." And I was like, well, "What is he gonna miss?" They said, "Speech." Him being at Birchwood in the afternoon is more productive for him than being in a classroom and, you know, and I don't know what he's doing. But the hours, that's what's the benefit, you know what I'm saying? And it saves us a lot of money. You know, I'm kind of happy. Not happy, but, you know, content. It's really hard. It's... I guess I gotta just... I don't know. Maybe you got something at the firehouse they can do. Oh, no. - I can solve the problem. - Okay, solve the problem. You have to integrate them into the community. That's what we're trying. Okay, I'm telling you what to do. Right, I'm listening. Would you mind if they worked at a car wash? - No. - Okay. But, if... I don't wanna just... If that's something that's in their interest. How about janitorial services, maintenance? Yeah, they do that. They do maintenance in the school. Okay, so if you've got them in the schools, why can't you develop a program where they go to all different schools? You gotta go be the advocate for them. Right, and I did that, but... Then you didn't do it hard enough, because I'm sure, if you go to the principal... - That's who I went to. - Then go over his head. That's who I went to. - It's easy to make it happen. - You think so? Yep, all you got to do is light the fire under yourself. Light the fire under myself? Oooh. I don't know. Matthew, come back here. Good morning, Quran. Good morning, Ms. Mino. How are you? -I'm fine. I'm fine. Good job. Now ask me, Quran. How are you? I'm fine. Thanks for asking. That was excellent, Quran. Look, I'm going to teach you something while we're here. These are your words, you gotta learn how to do this. Mom, I am hungry. You're hungry? What you wanna eat? Okay, go back. - I want dinner. - Dinner. You want some dinner? Okay. So it takes a while to become a habit. Pretty soon it's going to be so natural, like da-da-da, and he's going to repeat it, too. And then maybe it enhances some language, and they may not need it one day. Welcome. It's so wonderful to have you all here. What I want to see for each child is to fulfill their God-given capability to its maximum potential. And with the belief that every child in the autism spectrum has the ability to do so, and how do we help you accomplish that? Thank you for having me. My name is Janet Mino. I'm a school teacher in Newark Public Schools. I'm in the inner city. I listen to everybody talk about the different things they offer, but yet the inner city, where I work, we're not getting this information. I'm also working with young adults who are aging out and I've been looking for two years for different places for my young adults to go to, and we did have a success. Erik Taylor, he's working at Burger King and he's so happy. This is something that he wanted. Ready to go to work, Erik? - Yes. - All right, good, let's go. Let's go. Erik is great. He's outgoing. He comes and says good morning to everybody. We all love him. And I would love to have Erik work here permanently. I'm going to ask you to identify the different coins, okay? Robert, how many quarters are in a dollar? Four, good job, Robert. Give me a high-five or no? Yeah? Okay, guys, here we go. Is this a walk-a-thon? - No. - What's this? This is your neighborhood, guys. You can speak to people. Okay, look at the price. How much is this? You give him one quarter. And look, you have this, and you put it in your pocket. Good! Very good, guys. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. It's good, see? It's only water. Robert, I just think he's just sad. There you go, see? I just think he's sad. Good work. When somebody's hurting... and they can't express to you why... um... it's just hard to call sometime. Robert... "...a spring lamb. Home again..." Good job. How did you just switch off so quick? Hello? Do you want to finish this? I don't know what Robert's future is going to be. Birchwood is a safe place for him. He seemed to love it. Um... It's sad because Robert has a lot of potential. I don't know. All right. Toilet. - Toilet. - Yes. - Toilet. - All right, that's enough. Urinal. The urinal. - Great job, Erik. - Great job. Ms. Mino asked me to come back like once a week. Just on Mondays because the manager was saying that Erik was not doing his job. He would stop and just wipe the table just one time and just stay in one spot. - Now what do you do? - Mop. The manager and the other crew members had to, you know, "Erik, you have to do your job. Come on, you have to keep up. You have to wash the table, you got to wipe the windows down." So Ms. Mino asked me to come up here to make sure Erik is back on track. Gloves off. In order for Erik to continue to work at Burger King, he would just need once a week for someone to assist him. You got to realize, after Erik leaves here, he's out of my control. Whether they're going to give him a job coach or anything like that, it's up to the state and his mom to request that service. Awesome. So there's only a few of us that still ain't made our minds up. You know, hey, I'm a choosey mama. I'm a choosey mama. That's okay. I understand as a parent, you look and you're trying to find the right niche and say, "Okay, this is the place, I feel good about this." You guys have to come down and bring a decision. Or they're gonna be home. That's the thing for it. We don't want them home. I have to be realistic about what's out there. Excellent. And there we go. You have to just make a choice until something better comes out. Simon says do this. Simon says do this. Simon says do this. I-24. You want everything to be the way it is in your classroom, but it's not. Okay! I just wish I had a place for all of them. That you could appreciate their differences but help them develop more socially. Mm-hmm. But treat them like adults and have it fun. Right, 'cause you're looking at it from a teacher's perspective. No, I'm not. I was looking at it then as, if this was my kid, would I want them to come. Yeah, but they're going to be okay, Mino. I know you're worried and committed to them having success and guess what, there's nothing that we can do beyond what you've already done. They may or may not regress, but you have to kind of let it go. You really do. I feel that they will do fine, and I'm going to keep that positive perspective that they're going to do fine. I've done social work long enough where I really had to learn how to let go. Wow! You look handsome! Look at this! Oh, I like! Nice! Turn around. You got a haircut, too? Mino, look! Oh, let me see. Look at this. Hi. That's nice! Wow! Erik! I don't have any makeup. - Wait, Erik. - Wait, Erik. Look at you! Turn around! Ugh. Oh, right. Okay, okay, that's it. Now, here we go. Oh, boy. - Hey. - How you doing today? - Congratulations. - Thank you. The parents get as much as the kids. Hey, Robert! You, come here! He made it. Look at this. Here. There, look at the shoes! I like! I'm praying that Linda will be here because it would be really sad if everybody got somebody here and Robert don't at the end. Carina, you're in back of Robert Casper. You're in back of her. - Yes. - Erik. Erik, come out of line a minute. You're in the wrong spot anyway. Misme. Don't be nervous. This is your day. Forget about the people, this is your day. Good morning and welcome to John F. Kennedy School, the best kept secret in Newark. Graduation ceremony for the class of 2012. Everyone please rise. Give 'em a hand. Always when we come to a graduation, we know that it is the ending of something but it also the beginning of another chapter in the lives of our young people. Families, you must always, always advocate for your children. And fight for what is out there that they deserve. Do not sit back and let anyone tell you what they cannot do. We always thrive on what their abilities are, not what their disabilities are. And our next guest speaker is Mr. Erik Taylor. Yay! Today will be my last day at JFK School. I am sad that I have to leave it and will not return in September. But I know it is time for me to go. I came to John F. Kennedy School as a little boy but I am leaving as a young man. I would like to say thank you to my classmates who have been my family here, and I will never forget you and I hope you will not forget me. Thank you. Whoo! Now comes the part that lets us know that we're coming to a close. The diplomas to the class of 2012. Robert Casper! And the next diploma recipient is... Quran Rashid Key! Whoo! Go, go, go! And the next award recipient is Erik Taylor! Yay, Erik! And it gives me great honor and great pleasure to introduce the graduating class of 2012. Wow! Quran! All this stuff you got going on here. Oh, God. Oh, Robert, gimme a hug! Gimme a hug! Ohhh! Can I have a hug? Bye. Good luck with everything, okay? If Erik could, he would stay in school the rest of his life. Say, Erik, "I don't wanna do that! I got to move on to better things." -Right? Yes. Yay, you graduated! - Great! - All right! Bye! Hey, John! I've done everything that I could possibly do. I just hope it's enough. That's a nice job. Open... Yeah, yeah, wicked! What? What's that? Whoop! Come on, let's do one. Rosie, what season are we in? Summer. Very good. What is the month? - What month are we in? - September. - Right, and what is today? - Tuesday. Very good, and what is the number day? - 18th. - High-five! Good girl, Rosie. You did a great job. Now where do I wanna go? Whoo! All right, let me work with...
