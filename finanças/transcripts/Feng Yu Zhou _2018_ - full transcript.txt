Subtitle and translated by BNX213. Thanks to BNX213 One who was ready to sacrifice himself to protect a land was called Shalen (Sacred Guardian) The four ancient fierce beasts Hun Dun Tao Wu Qiong Qi and Tao tie (Glutton) from another world were endangering the human world with the devastating zero force. At such a crucial moment some Shalens appeared. By using the energy of Metal Wood Water Fire and Earth the five fundamental elements. They fought courageously with the ferocious beasts but only to find the beasts' zero force was too powerful to be beaten. Afterwards Shalens found the force of wind outside the five elements and turned it into the Wind Spell. Finally the spirits of the four fierce beasts were sealed and later thrown somewhere in the human world. The human world was finally restored to peace and order. From then on the spirit of Shalen was handed down from generation to generation and those who got the stamp of Shalen on their palms would have to shoulder the responsibility of guarding the human world. Well, if you expect this film to be an epic I suggest that you have your ticket refunded as quickly as possible because the hero might be quite different from what you might have imagined. Cathch him! Blind boy! Stop! Stop running! this fierce-looking and sturdily-built man isn't me Well, those two idiots can never be me, either. The handsome boy walking calmly in front of them and enjoying the soft spring breeze is me. Stop! My name is Lang Ming. and I'm blind. But I have excellent hearing and can hear what other people in the world can't hear. So the mortal and vulgar ones like them can never catch me Don't run away! But ther're some things that can't be heard at all. like... About thirty minutes ago, I was a hero trying to save people out of their failure lives. Show me your left hand and let me see whether you've got a stamp like mine. Look, it's a symbol of Shalen and the symbol of the hero See if you've got it in your palm. Who has got it? No Do you? I don't have, either. Well, then it'll be impossible for you to be a Shalen all your life. What a pity! But we're still young. So what? If you can't be a Shalen how can you compete with your golden bachelor? If you can't be a Shalen how can you win your true love? Won't you admit you're a loser until you really become penniless? Come over Well, let me give you a chance to have the stamp of Shalen. Kids fix your eyes here without even a blink Wow! Wow! What's this yellow (pornographic) book?

Whenever I'm in danger, I would call her name instinctively and she'd appear in front of me Because she is my mother Oh How could you call your mother like that? You are no longer a little boy How can you always turn to me for help when you are in trouble? Others will laugh at you. Let's go home Aunt Mei How can you just leave without saving our face Your face? Okay, here it is. Enough? This is not a face it's a slap. Aunt Mei We're gangsters. Gangsters? You? I'll tell your mother to punish you. Aunt Mei Let's make a deal Business is business don't get my family involved. Then get out of my way Okay Run Yi Hen Xi have you got any message from the Shalens on the hunt of the demons? So many leaves are falling off the old mulberry tree. it's not a good sign. No, it isn't. That demon wanders everywhere we haven't got any clues yet. If we can grasp the secret of the ancient Shalens, and make use of the force outside the five elements You mean... Do you still remember the man we met 13 years ago? A pair of turtle doves are cooking on an island in the middle of the river Son Don't blame me for asking you to do this. You're still young and see no prospects of a good future by hanging around in the marketplace. From now on I hope you can settle down and work hard don't make me disappointed It's not that I don't try hard but you expect too much from me You'll get rewarded as you set your heart on it As long as you stick to your goal you'll get what you want.

Mei Jie Although my excellent hearing helps win money whenever we gamble I really don't want to do this. First, I don't want to be beaten and second... Well, here's one for you, One for me. One for our living cost Another one for me Another one for you. And another one for me, Mei Jie I am blind but I'm neither deaf nor stupid. I've got only two but you have four. Really? Oh that must be mercy from god Only god knows how hard it is for a single mother to raise a child. Here we go again. What are you talking about? Your disappointing father died when you were five. You can imagine how hard it is for me to bring you up. I haven't enjoyed a single happy day Since the day I fell in love with your father He did nothing but talked big to me all the time He said "Mei Jie, I'll soon grasp the Wind Spell and become a true Shalen." But till when you were born I didn't see him grasp the Wind Spell but myself living an unstable life. What spell? It was a curse that made me live a wretched life. I do remember I had a father. Whether he was a Shalen, I don't know and even whether there are Shalens in the world, I don't know either. Son Look what I've got for you. Oh, sorry. I'll say it again. Son, listen to what I've got for you. What is it? Well, this is something secret from Shalen It's the Wind Spell. Come on Whatever you get, you believe it is Wind Spell. It's nothing but a pinwheel No It may look just like a pinwheel but through it, we can see the force of the wind Just like you, Mei Jie beauty is just your appearance and through you we can feel the power of love Stop that nonsense. The sun is setting wash your hands for dinner Is the pinwheel the secret of Wind Spell? Yes, it is. We can not see the wind but the turning of the pinwheel seems to enable us to see the wind. But I can't see the turning of the pinwheel. Son Only someone blind like you can grasp the Wind Spell Really? We should feel the essence of everything in the world with our heart Then tell me how to feel it. Aaaaah! Are you feeling it now? Let me down, dad. Just as a kite can feel the wind a river can feel the rain and a grassland can feel the earth the secret of the Wind Spell is contained in everything in the world. Son Are you feeling it now? The feeling of riding the wind? All I can feel is that you're going insane. That's my father May Jie, let me explain After that He was really gone, riding the wind. No news was ever heard of him. You're my son. Would you have to settle the money matters so clearly between us? Yes You've really got your guts. I'll divide the money equally between us but I'll break it off with you. You live your own life and I'll live mine. Mother Well, do you feel sorry or something? Don't worry I'll forgive you. I want your portion. How clever you are. Has everything gone well with your mission? Yes, pretty well. Up to now, Shalens haven't got any clues. Very good I want you to go to another place and get back something for me. Okay Why are you here again? I've told you many times that it is impossible for him to see again. Shut up Just prescribe medicines for him. It's the 2,333rd time you have come to me. How can make my son see again? Lang Jing Please show me the way. Shalens do they really exist? The stamp on my palm is perhaps nothing but a scar. Even if it's just a scar I can't see what it looks like Well What is that sound? You two go there to take a look But boss It's getting late I'll have to go home to wash my mother's feet. Hush You obey my command Tonight we must defeat him. What? Wait! Wait for me! Why can't I take it out? Is it because of the zero force inside me? Don't hide there Come out The sound comes from right here. What is it? It feels like a top A common person without zero force got it so easily What monster is lurking there? Come out! What monster? Who are you? What's your name? It is a blind boy You Blind boy I'm too busy for any crap Give the top to me If you want it pay me then Shut up Eyebrows nose eyes and mouth! Oh god! It's a human face It's very handsome. Wait a second What? I can see! This is a big green tree That noise comes from this cicada! What stinks is this dung! Is this really me? I can see. I can see! I can see! Everything is so beautiful! You bad girl. You bad girl! Am I dead? No, I'm still alive. Aaaah! Hey! I can see now! What is it that made me see the world again? What did I do last night? I ate my meal had a fight with my mother and then went to the mountain The top? Is it the top that makes me see the world? I'll go home to tell Mei Jie of the good news. Three, two, one I'm back in Xiaoyanggang. Is this Xiaoyanggang where I've lived years? What's wrong? It's usually noisy and bustling here. Where has everyone gone? Mei Jie! Oh Whose the big dog is this? Sit You. You are... He seems to have seen us. Impossible He's blind. What's more, our disguise is perfect even I can't see myself. Are you the Firecracker Gangsters? He can see now You are so ugly Better looking than you What are you doing here? Silly question. Of course we are hiding from the demon. The demon? Don't stare at me there are three men over there. Whenever I find myself in a very dangerous situation I feel unusually peaceful in mind. I know I am the hero and the hero can't die. Who is it? Catch it! Awesome! They saved us They are amazing! They drove away the demon. They are heroes They saved us Thank you Who are you? I am Zhan Chi Zhan Chi? Zhan Chi the Shalen? Yes Oh, he really is a Shalen Mom, it's Zhan Chi! Hello I didn't realize you're so famous. Are you really Shalens? My name is Yu Bu Dong It's me who saved you. Then you must be Qian Jun. and you two are Chen Yue and Bi Ting. Bi Ting? Dad didn't lie to me about Shalens. Do you have a stamp then? Stamp? Well, right here. Yes, its really the stamp of Shalen. How come it looks different from the stamp on Lang Ming's palm? Finally, I saw what a real Shalen stamp looks like Then he must have been lying all this time. He's a liar. Who knows where the demon came from? You should ask the blind boy! Why ask me? I don't know. You don't know? What did you do in the mountain last night? Yeah! What did you do? When you came back this morning, you can see again. The demon also came and it only followed you. Isn't it you that attracted the demon here? Isn't it you that attracted the demon here? Well, I guess you have nothing to say to defend yourself now I guess so The blind boy can see now, can't he? Yes, he can. Really? What happened? Well... Well, he has been an idler and a liar since his childhood Then he must be the one who attracted the demon here. I said it already that it's not me It must have been him Idling all the time, selling fakes He's a liar. Only after he is driven out of Xiaoyanggang can we have peace. Drive him away Drive him away from Xiaoyanggang Okay, you really are something. You bullied me when I was blind. Now I've recovered my sight, you're still bullying me. You know what? Can you imagine what I'll do to you with the Wind Spell? The seals you sold to us are fake. The demon has run away. What? Bi Ting, You Bu Dong, you stay here. All the others, go with me to catch him! Okay Don't worry everyone In fact, that demon has attacked many villages. Xiaoyanggang isn't the only one We came all the way here to find out more about the demon. Where is the blind boy? Go home. Go straight. After thirty steps, turn left. Is this my home? What? What happened? Mei Jie May Jie, I'm back. Mei Jie Mei Jie, Where are you? What happened? Mei Jie, I can see now. Where are you? Come out to see me, Mei Jie. Mei Jie! Mei Jie! Isn't that your wish that I can see again? I really can see now. Mei Jie! Mei Jie, are you mad at me? for not coming back home last night? Okay, I'm sorry I won't make you angry again. I won't ask you to divide your money between us. I'll help you win in gambling. Please come out to meet me. Mother! Mom, stop it, okay? I can see you. Come out. Mom, I beg you to come out. Mom I can see everything now. I want to see you most at this moment but I can't find you. Can you still recognize her even if you see her now? What are you doing here? All the damage here must have been caused by the demon. The demon? The demon. What are you doing here? I want to make a deal with you If you want to find your mother, you'll have to find the demon first. And I'm the only one who can find the demon. What is your relationship with the demon? Where is my mother? If you want to know where your mother is, give me the top. Tell me where she is. Give me the top, I'll take you to her. The top is in my stomach I won't give it to you until I see my mother. Let me take you to her. Why should I believe you? Do you have any other choice? You'd better not cheat me otherwise, you'll never get the top. Let's go What's the matter? I seem to feel a familiar force is lurking around. I'm thinking where Chen Yue and the others are in their pursuit of the demon and whether they can feel... What is it? It seems to be the zero force What? Mom, look. My pinwheel is turning so fast. Mom, look! My pinwheel is turning so fast. Mom, look. Okay, I see it. Mom, look! Be careful. Blind boy, there's no way for you to turn away this time. Uh-oh. wait for me! It's so horrible I can't choose my family, so I'm on my adventurous journey to get away from mom's worried sighing and weeping What I intend to get is freedom but not chivalry I don't want my life to be suffocating So for thousand of miles, over hight mountains I'm travelling. to change my life, I've become a fighter accidentally Throwing behind complaints, here I start my adventurous journey I don't fear demons and will beat them whenever they are in my way I only want to win the victory regardless of what weapon is in my hand Feel honored to have you for company together let's defend justice Maybe you're not the hero at the beginning till you hold on to the end with your persistence and get rewarded for your blood, sweat and tears Blind boy becomes Shalen and amazes everybody I'll find her, fin my mother and go back home. Anyone standing in my way has to step back I'm ready to help, and fear no enemy I care nothing about pains because glory is hidden behind them More precious than gold is a prodigal who becomes good Anyone standing in my way has to step back I'm ready to help, and fear no enemy I care nothing about pains because glory is hidden behind them More precious than gold is a prodigal who becomes good Have you spat out the top? What's wrong with you? I'm warning you, if you want to find your mother If you still want to find the words your mother stop playing any tricks on me What do you want? I need to pee. Wait for a while I can't wait anymore I'd have done it earlier if I hadn't worried that you'd run away What happened to you? Shalens What are you doing here? Blind boy What are you doing with a zero? Zero? Since the Qiong Qi beast was sealed by Shalens years ago no such evil force has been seen in the world Who are you? It's none of your business. Shalens managed to remove the zero force from human world. If it appears again there will be a catastrphe Girl, to avoid my wrong judgement will you please let me check you? No problem. Do you want me to take off my clothes? No need A circular mark will show itself on the forehead of someone with zero force. Be careful What happened? Blind boy Go catch her You can't let her go I don't see a circular mark on her forehead. Are you taking the wrong one? We are Shalens. Trust us. Shalens. Yes, I believe you. But I'm afraid I can't do what you want me to do. Blind boy What are you doing? Because she is the only one who can help me Blind boy, please don't... I'm sorry Hey I know how handsome I am But as a girl, you need to be more reserved. It seems we are trapped here in the hole. We need to find a way to get out of here. How can such a beautiful girl possibly be a zero? Hey! Wake up. I should have been the injured one since I had been underneath you when we fell down. Hey She's still breathing Well, forgive me for doing this to you Well, it seems... Who slapped me? Well, I didn't mean to hurt you. The top! The top! I really did not mean to hurt you - Give me the top! Blind boy Give me the top! Give it to me. Give it to me! You haven't help me find May Jie. I need to take out the top from your stomach. I can hardly control the zero force inside me. Get away from me! Okay Where can I go? Hurry Tell me a beautiful story What? If you don't want to die, tell me a happy story. Okay Long ago, there was a boy who was blind But... But he is happy every day Children around him often bullied him Oh, no, they often played with him. Everyone, yes, everyone loved this boy and no one looked down on him for his blindness. The boy lived in a courtyard where there was a big locust tree In spring he would sit under the tree with his parents feeling the wind Feeling the growth of everything and feeling love When he was grown up he left his home and went to Jiugongling because he had been cherishing a dream since his childhood. He wanted to be a respectable Shalen like his father With the stamp in his palm he passed the strict selection examination organized by Jiugongling and become a true Shalen to safeguard justice from then on. Can I ask you a question? say it What's special about the top that makes you so eager to get it? And, are you really a zero? What's a zero? You asked more than one question Indeed I used to be a common person. but now I can't even remember my own name. I am told by someone that if I can get the top for him I'll be able to return to my normal life Then you're really a zero, aren't you? Is zero a demon? Well, even if you dont tell me I need to know how to call you. Well, how about Little Goblin? Um. It sounds not bad as a name. Blind boy, how dare you? Listen Little Goblin... Do you hear the wind coming from over there? Guardian God demons are wreaking havoc everywhere in the world. Please show the villagers mercy by guaranteeing them peaceful and rich life Well we need to move this big stone to get out of here. It's too big to be moved away. Look, the Guardian God nodded his head! No Let's run away! The God's head is falling! Hey Why do you bind us? Let us go. Hey brother can you tell me where we are? In That Village What village? I guess you can think of a way for us to get away, right? Blind boy how could I possibly be captured alive if I hadn't been injured? Since you've got excellent hearing, can you hear what they're talking about? No. My hearing seems to have declined since I recovered my sight But I'm pretty good at reasoning, you know. They must be talking about using us as their sacrifices for god. But it sounds too conventional to be fresh for this. Well, we've agreed that we're going to offer you as sacrifices to god. Do you think it's good? No. Definitely no. Why are you doing this to us? You broke the statue of our Guardian God. Now demons are wreaking havoc everywhere, if we don't offer sacrifices the god won't protect our village. If he won't, I will. I'm on my way to find demons You? Yes I am a Shalen. A real one. How to prove that? See the stamp on my palm. It's really the stamp of Shalen. It really is! Well More than that I also know how the lost secret handed down from ancient Shalens The Wind Spell! Really? Show it to us then. Untie his hands! Well Wind is a force outside the five elements We can't see it but that doesn't mean that it does not exist. The secret of the Wind Spell is contained in everything. Don't you see it? It's me who stopped the wind. Shalen! Shalen! Shalen! Okay the, we'll only sacrifice one of you. Stop! She... she... she, she is my wife. She must be with me. How could you...? Your wife? That's wonderful! My folks what a lucky thing it is for the whole village I've never expected, even in my dreams, to be able to offer a Shalen to god as sacrifice What? What's more He offered to make his wife sacrifice too. Now I announce that the sacrificial ceremony starts now! If you had shut your mouth off, I would have been spared They have gone quite far They must have gone into the mountain. See the falco rusticolus What happened? The blind boy from Xiaoyanggang is with zero. Zero? The blind boy from Xiaoyanggang is with zero. Zero? How come there's still a zero in the human world? Wasn't it completely eliminated a long time ago? Demons have appeared probably because of zero. Let's go to meet Bi Ting and Yu Bu Dong before we make any further plans. Okay If you punish, just punish them too. Oh, they are the ones to blame If you punish, just punish them too. Oh, it's them who broke your head. If you punish, just punish them too. God, if you don't show any sign of punishment, well, we'll leave them like that Is this their sacrificial ceremony? Stop looking down any further! If you don't stop, I'll make you blind again. Ceremony is over. Is it over? Are they kidding me? Water is the medium for us to communicate with God. By putting you two in the water and asking my people to sing and dance we intend to convey an important message to god. What message? That the statue was broken by you two, not us. Well, how can you simply shift your responsibility like that? It was broken because you hadn't built it solid enough. Sorry for having to put you in the water. Let me introduce myself My name is Wang Fugui, I'm head of That Village. Well, he is also called Wang Fugui, the neighborhood head. who will invite you two for dinner And this is the village's accountant, Wang Fugui. I'm a carpenter Wang Fugui I'm a blacksmith and my name is Wang Fugui. I am a tailor and you can call me Wang Fugui. Well, no need to introduce everyone to you. Where is the cook? Wang Fugui Wang Fugui Is there anything wrong with my hearing? Don't you want to come out of the water? Well we'd better stay a little longer here. ask them to prepare two rooms for us. I need my injury to be treated. You're husband and wife. Why take the trtouble to sleep separately? Quick, Wang Fugui, Prepare a room for the Shalen and his wife. Okay. What a sweet surprise! How has everything been going? Master, do you still remember what you promised me? Don't worry. Of course, I do. Where is it? I've got it. Then why don't you come back? It's in someone's stomach. I thought about bringing him back with me but something unexpected happened. Little Goblin, what are you doing there? I'm getting dressed, don't come in. The village head invites us to dinner and everyone is waiting for you. I'll join you later. What a useless thing! But anyway, the thing I want has been found. When I get everything ready for you it'll be time to bring your power into full play Are you feeling better? We ate the same for dinner, why does my stomach hurt but you're totally fine? Cut the crap. Has the top come out? Of course not. Since I swallowed it nothing has come out of my intestines All has got stuck there. Impossible. You've stayed in the toilet for so long. I had difficulty getting it out. Of course, it was long. Oh, I need to use the toilet again. What? Is there only one toilet in your village? Yeah Before I find Mei Jie I'm afraid I'll have to die of food poisoning here in a strange land. No, you won't You mean we'll find Mei Jie for sure, don't you? I mean that's not food poisoning. I put laxative in your food. Don't worry, the effect stays only for a short while. How could you...? If you want to find your mother, you need to give the top to me. Can't you see I'm trying to help you? Mei Jie What's on your palm is not a Shalen stamp, but a scar. That's none of your business. This pinwheel looks so familiar. Give it back to me. It's the Wind Spell handed down from my ancestors. Give it back to me! Do you really believe that you are a Shalen who can safeguard justice? Well, I... Give the wind spell back to me. As a fairy I appear to subdue the Firecracker Gangsters. If you don't want to die right away, give me all your snacks immediately. But we have given you all the lollipops we Mountain Gangsters have. He's teling the truth The blind boy hasn't given you his, you should punish him. Let us go, please. How could you say that? He is here to save you. I hate disloyalty most. Blind boy, give me your pinwheel as our first-meeting gift. As for your lollipop, I'll ask them for it. Let's go Let me teach you a lesson Blind boy, are you stupid or something? Why don't you run away? Stop crying, son. It's not a common scar. Why not? You safeguarded justice through your bravery today so your scar is a Shalen stamp. Is this a Shalen stamp? Save your crap for some other time. Show me your scar, son. Does it still hurt? I'm a Shalen. I'll conquer all difficulties through Wind Spell and ride the wind I am a Shalen. Oh my god, the way you speak now is exactly like your father. The Wind Spell You're right Why would I think about being a Shalen I can't even protect Mei Jie. Sorry I didn't realize your Wind Spell gets broken so easily. Never mind. It's just a toy from my childhood. The most important thing now is to find and rescue Mei Jie.. When you recover, we'll be on our way. Oh no! I feel it coming out again. All of you! Move aside! Urinary tract is smooth intestines are obstructed stomachache and bowel failure in bowel movement. Well, what disease does this symptoms indicate? Where is he? I'm coming. How long has he been like this? Who can come to help me get up? Since he swallowed a top. A top? Is it the one in the mountain near Xiaoyanggang? How do you know about it? I don't feel right. What's wrong? I get cramps in my fingers. You come with me Wait for me. What are we here for? Look This is the book about the history of That Village. Anyway, we don't need this page. Right here. Thirteen years ago, I and two other villagers called Wang Fugui went to the mountain to collect medicinal herbs and accidentally entered a mysterious cave where by mistake, released a mysterious sealed force. After the force entered my body, I gradually lost my consciousness and felt hungry quite often. Everything I saw, I wanted to swallow it At the crucial moment when I was going to swallow my two companions, a hero appeared. He sealed the force in a top But he lost his life. To honor the hero whose name remains unknown, we mobilized the resources of the whole village to build a statue for him. That statue, however, was broken by you. You mean the top in my stomach is where the mysterious force was sealed? Exactly. So we'll have to figure out how to take it out Village head What's the matter? The villagers are organizing a donation to repair the statue they want you to preside over the ceremony. Well, You wait here for me. I'll be back soon. Since the top is so dangerous, why do you want it? You said it can make you return to your normal life. Is it true? You won't be up to something evil with it, Will you? But it seems it is the top that has recovered my sight If it can really make you a human again, I'd give it to you. even if at the cost of becoming blind again. Anyway, I'm used to being blind. I think it is worthwhile to exchange my sight for your human life. But you'll have to help me find Mei Jie as you promised. Why are you silent? Can you just stop talking? Let's figure out how to take out the top first. Did I really have dream in which I saw you smile? Our eyes are sparkling in the sunset You said we were close side by side You said I was once in your heart The moon is too shy to shine us bright Who are fireflies glowing for? Who are the lovebirds swimming in pairs for? Why would one smile in joy and feel lovesick heartache? My sweetheart, who are you dressing up for and what does love look like? Why would lovers blush at meeting and weep over parting I how I wish I could know the answer. Well cutting your stomach open seems to be the only choice. I'll have to figure it out by myself. We'd have done it if we had wanted to. Let's just give it up and leave it here Who has thought of such a stupid idea. If only I had cut open your stomach to save you all these sufferings When you get the top and return to your normal life, where will you go? and what are you going to do? If I can recover my lost memories I guess I'll go to find my family I'll help you find them. You'd better pray for yourself and figure out how to take the top out. Stop talking rubbish. Little Goblin When I give you the top and lose my sight again can I still find you? Blind boy how can you possibly lose it again since you recovered it? Oh, dear. it's coming out Now? Oh, no, it still doesn't come out. Take a deep Breath. How about now? It's coming out soon. I can see part of it. How about now? This is... It's for you. For me? Don't misubderstand. I bought it. I didn't... Where is the top? Here it is. I've already cleaned it. I recovered my sight after I swallowed the top. So, keep it and don't lose it. You're smiling, aren't you? No. Why don't you take the top? I... I haven't helped you find your mother yet. What happened? Wang Fugui is missing. Be careful. Kid, run away! Little Goblin Come hide behind me. What are you waiting for? Who is he? Hey, what are you doing? I lied to you About what? I did everything just to get the top. I don't know where your mother is. If you don't want to die leave as quickly as you can. Little Goblin What are you talking about? Master I've got the top. Let's go Master Blind boy How come this demon appear here? Things are getting more exciting Tell me Where is Mei Jie? Jia Ye It's you. Zhan Chi the Shalen Long time no see Don't be nervous I'm not here for a fight. You're too green as my opponents. Who is he? He is to blame for the zero force in human world. I didn't expect him to live till now. How come you don't know who he is after having stayed with him for so long It's late, let's go. You can't go like that. Catch him! See you later. Go and catch him. Calm down There is more than one demon. and they appear because of Jia Ye. Such an important matter should be reported to Jiugongling immediately. Then what are we waiting for? Let's go I'm sorry I have no idea about what happened here. Wang Fugui is missing. It's you who brought all the misfortunes. I'm sorry I'm not a Shalen. As for that Little... I don't know who she is. I lied to you If I had been able to predict all this, I wouldn't have made you stay. You broke the statue, cheated us and brought misfortune to That Village. I... But in order to protect us you did try your best at the crucial moment. We all have something to protect I guess you're no exception. It doesn't matter whether you are a Shalen or not to protect those you want to protect Even in the face of extremely powerful enemy and an unpredictable future you should proceed without hesitation Mei Jie Although I don't know what happened I think I need to bring them back Mei Jie Little... Wang Fugui Uhmm.. Uhmm, which Wang Fugui did he mean? Do you still remember that I used to be blind Well, it seems to have been ready because I smell the smell of desire Is everyone ready? Yes But... What? Since you've got it can you...? What? Give back to me my freedom and memories to turn me into a human. Oh, yes. I did say when you bring back the top I'd tell you how to return to human life. Well, it's quite simple actually. If you die the zero force inside you will naturally disappear. You lied. I really don't understand why some people just can't forget what they've lost? You ask for lost memories from someone else don't you think it's ridiculous? Do you know what's inside the top? It's the spirit of the ancient ferocious monster Tao Tie. What? Now everything is ready when I call Tao Tie out will everything in the world belong to me. Stay with me, and you'll get what you want. Commander Any news from Zhan Chi and his companions? Call together all the Tai-Chi Shalens in Jiugongling! Where is Mei Jie? You, blind boy you must know where she is I don't care who you are. Just tell me where Mei Jie is. otherwise, I'll... Come with me Your mother... is among them. What? If you can recognize her maybe you can meet her one last time. I don't believe it. Mei Jie These demons were human Human? But now they're not human anymore They are just the food for Tao Tie Why? Because of desire. Desire? Everyone has got a strong desire that he wants to realize Whatever the desire is, Tao Tie can make it come true but at the cost of turning the person into a demon to be his food Jia Ye wants to use Tao Tie to kill Shalens so he needs to feed it and wake it up. I'm controlled by Jia Ye So I have to find in the human world those with a strong desire and then help them realize it and see them turn into demons accordingly to be eaten by Tao Tie. Desire? Her desire is to make you see again. So the demon I met in Xiaoyanggang is Mei Jie, isn't it? YesUh She just wanted to see whether I've recovered my sight, didn't she? Jia Ye has left for the Gan Ge Valley. These demons will soon be swallowed by Tao Tie. And after that, Tao Tie will appear in the human world again. I'll exchange my life as Tao Tie's food for the desire that Mei Jie turns into human again. Blind boy if that were possible I'd rather lose my life for it. Unfortunately, nobody else but Tao Tie can make it happen. Whats happening? It's happening as expected. Mei Jie Mei Jie Mei Jie Mother Blind boy, come out quickly Mother Where are you? Blind boy You're risking your life. Hurry up. The Gan Ge Valley is just ahead. Mother Mother Mother Blind boy Mother No Mother Mother Well, what I see here and now makes me feel how tragic and beautiful the world is. Jia Ye Show me your respect are you trying to betray your master? I hate most being called directly by my name Jia Ye Who is it? Fine All the Shalens are here. That saves me the trouble of calling you together. I thought you're already dead when the beast Qiong Qi got killed I didn't expect you to still be alive. There are more things you didn't expect to happen. You didn't expect that you'd die right here today, did you? Stop all the rubbish. Come out Tao Tie! Tao Tie? How can it appear? Destroy Jiugongling Kill all the Shalens Shroud the whole world with your terrifying force All the Shalens, Get ready to fight! It has waken up. Yes, it has. Look It's really the ferocious beast Tao Tie. It's coming out! Finally, it's coming out! Everybody, run away! A disaster is coming. Go, hide in the cave beneath the statue. All the Shalens Go to Xiaoyanggang immediately to protect the people there! Yes! Give Mei Jie back to me! Shalens have exhausted your zero force. Now, I'll kill you myself. Did you forget? There's still a zero force in your body. Little Goblin Run! Leave here, quickly! sister! Kill him! Kill him immediately! Little Goblin What happened? Little Goblin Little Goblin Long time ago, there was a little boy who was blind but he was happy every day. No one around him looked down upon him for his blindness. In spring he would sit under the tree with his parents feeling the wind Feel the growth of everything feeling love. Finally like his father he became a Shalen to safeguard the world. Then how about you, then? Do you remember your family and your life? No. In my memories apart from evil there's only you. Blind boy In fact, I've been cherishing some words in my heart that I want to tell you... Little Goblin Little Goblin Little Goblin She's dead. What a useless thing! What do you want to do? You owe your recovered sight to me. Had it not been for the force of Tao Tie, you would've been blind forever. Blind! Jia Ye Now I give back what I owe to you Son Only someone blind like you can master the Wind Spell. If my father did not lie to me and everything he said was true, Then I'll have to find the answer in the wind. The essence of everything in the world isn't supposed to be seen with eyes. Till that moment did I realize what it means. Yes, I'm blind So what? The world is still as beautiful as usual. I am not a Shalen so what? I've got my unique stamp on my palm. Prepare to attack! Commander, with only us? Battle formation! Heaven and earth, yin and yang Five elements, primordial qi and eight points. The sun, the moon and the stars The nine constellations form one primitive force Hold on, everyone. I'm afraid I can't... Then... Be ready to die. Look, the blind boy! It's him. It's really him. Dad, can he be a Shalen without a stamp? Whether he is a Shalen or not, he is protecting us. Man must conform to the earth, earth to heaven, heaven to Tao and Tao to nature. One can never be trained to master a magical power. Man and nature are inseparable I'm in nature, and nature is in me. Just as I can control the wind, and I'm also under it's control Are you feeling it? Yes, I am. Ah, I'm feeling it now. That's great! Oh! Boss! Can you feel it? No. Then you're doomed to a failed life. I'm feeling it right now. At this very moment. A gust of wind it's blowing into my face. You bad boy. What are you doing here? Be gentle to me, Mei Jie. Anyway, I am the man who saved the world please show me your respect. Well you can all go class is over. Save the world? But you're still blind. You can't see what I look like Mother I couldn't see more clearly than now. I can see the onion in your teeth. You bad boy! How can you possibly hear that? I don't have to listen I can just smell it. One, two Uhmm. Now, it looks better. Do you love me or something? You've been staring at me for quite a while. You naughty boy always joking Do you want to go with me to Jiugongling? Me? Forget it. I don't have the Shalen stamp on my palm. Besides I like Xiaoyanggang Afterall, it's my hometown. We once missed a person like you. This top where the spirit of Tao Tie was sealed belonged to him. Who? Thirteen years ago those who come to visit Jiugongling selection exam were asked to spin the top with their energy. Back then, When all the others failed A young man showed us a force we had never seen before and managed to spin the top at full speed. Later we learned that it was a force outside the five elements. The Wind. But we refused to select him because we didn't find the Shalen stamp on his palm. I don't want to make the same mistake again. So come with me to Jiugongling and be a real Shalen. No, thanks. My mother is still waiting at home for me to join her for supper. It doesn't matter whether a man is a Shalen or not. What matters is whether he is brave enough to protect those in need Where there is justice there is the Shalen spirit. But before I go, I wonder whether you can give me that top. I wish to bring it to my son as a gift. Subtitles by Bongkie As a fairy, I appear like a thunderous force. It's really bad luck for you three to see me. I happened to pass by and lost all my money Can you lend some to me? Little Goblin What did you call me? Who are you? Oh You're done for! He's the Shalen of our village Lang Ming She is obviously making trouble here Girl Can you tell me your name? I don't think it's time for flirting. Do you have something to tell me that you wanted to but didn't? Blind boy Why would you have to go after a short stay Please tell me how to make you stay with me We were so close, so don't give up easily Never have I felt so hlepless How could you leave me enchanted completely Please don't get away from me How could I bear to see you leave so hastily How could I carry on with only our past staying with me Can you show me your lightest intention to stay Can you feel all my courage to ask you not to go away Seeing your figure fading away Relieve my despair as the remaining beauty In my heart that is beating weakly Is still the sigh that stays whole temporarily You said there's nothing you can't let go Then can I be an exception to you Let me ask the unreasonable destiny I hate to use my last strength To search all my memories And find you back only How could you bear to see me return again to sadness Please, there's love between us to cherish I hate to use my last strength To search all my memories Can you show me your slightest intention to stay Can you feel all my courage to ask you not to go away Seeing your figure fading away Relieve my despair as the remaining beauty In my heart that is beating weakly Is still the sigh that stays whole temporarily You said there's nothing you can't let go Then can I be an exception to you Let me ask the unreasonable destiny I hate to use my last strength To search all my memories And find you back only And find you back only Subtitle and translated by BNX213.
