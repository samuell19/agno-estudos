Okay, tell me this. Many lives were lost because of Corona. Do you think they were all sinners? -I don't think so, sir. -So? You want a straight answer for a tricky question?

Then he fell in love. WEDDING - BITTU WEDS ASHA SATTU BHAIYA He bid goodbye to crime and criminal and moved into his little world. And, obviously, Sattu bhaiya was not very happy about it. But as they say, past sins and past love often catch up with you. -And when they do, they mess you up. -Bittu! You may want to quit, but crime won't let you go. Section 307, attempt to murder. And Bittu went behind bars for six long years. Where is Ruhi? Where is Ruhi? Hey, Sana, shampoo… Put your hand under it. Shampoo is not in this. I'll get it tomorrow. There is a comb missing. Go and get one later. This is for Ruhi. Ruhi is at school. -I'll come back in the evening. -Bittu, she's… in a hostel. She… doesn't know about you. She… thinks… Bhanu is her dad. I thought you will never come back. So, for a few days, I sent-- Hey, Bittu! -Bittu, no! Listen to me! Look… -Bittu! What are you doing? Let him go! No! Some people are lonely. With no one to call their own, sir. And then there are some who are lonely amidst their own. Mini's parents are always busy.

Wait and watch, sir, to what extent Mini goes. Oh, my God. -This is a kidnapping case. -What? -I think your daughter has been kidnapped. -Please save my daughter. -Please, sir, save our daughter. -Only you can save my daughter.

He must come see me. Bye. Hey, come on. Let's go. Asha, don't worry. They… took away Bhanu. Go complain to the police. You are the cause for all of this, Bittu. Sattu is using us to get back at you. We had taken a loan of 50 lakhs. Now, somehow with interest, it's 90 lakhs. Today, they forcibly took Bhanu away. What was his fault? He did what he did for his family, for our parlor, and for Ruhi's boarding school fees. Today, they took away Bhanu. If… If they kidnap Ruhi someday, only then you'll be happy. I don't know why I married you. I curse myself for it. Make sure Bittu isn't carrying any weapons. -Hello, sir. -Come on, have a seat. Who the fuck is going to make the tea? Who? Should I? Move!

Get the check for table number five… He… What is his name? Babu. Babu. What… brings you here? I always knew it. One who doesn't wash his hands after peeing can never be a good man.

How can I leave him? He is my husband. He's Babu's daddy. How can I leave him? I hate porn. I'm glad they banned it. What ban? My phone is full of it. I love porn. They work so hard. And if you start the clip midway, you can still get the story. -But there is a practical problem, dude. -What? Porn sets wrong expectations. People start having false expectations. -Nonsense. -Hey… Look, Johnny and Mia keep it going nonstop for two hours in the clip. But our Mr. Gupta here, he is done in two minutes flat. But no kidding, bro, it has ruined many lives. I had a friend, Chandan. In school, when asked what your goal in life is, what do you say? Doctor, engineer. Yes! But do you know what Chandu said? "I want to be a pizza delivery boy." In the hope that while delivering pizza, one day some chick might say, "I am so lonely, Chandu." "Would you like to share my cheese burst?" Hey, move your hand! Hey, looks like my bro can relate to it. My boy, don't go down that path. His idea is better. He visits matrimonial websites for blind dates. Can't you keep a secret? Tell them. But it's been three years. But it's still fresh in my mind. So, he met a girl on a matrimonial website. The girl asked him to wait at so-and-so coffee shop with a packet of so-and-so chips. But I forgot to ask her if I should only hold it or if I am allowed to eat a few, too. And then she came. She looked exactly the way the groom's family always imagines… their future daughter-in-law. -Hi. -Hi. You are… not photogenic at all. I mean, you look better in person. Thanks. -Shruti Choksi. -Akash Chauhan. Dr. Akash Chauhan, right? What kind of doctor are you? I have a doctorate in Arts. I did my PhD in Mongolian Art in Mughal Architecture.

What brings you here? You are from Bhilai. I am here for six months on an internship. -Okay. -So on weekends… -You meet prospective grooms? -Yes. And… -what do you do? -I'm actually a sales executive. -Where? -Kaamdhenu Electronics. Hope you don't mind, but what's you annual CTC? Well, I can't save much, but I don't need to take loans either. And your family? An expert interviewer can gauge a candidate's worth within five minutes. I mean, the girl wanted a Ferrari and I was just a nobody. And she understood that well by the time we crossed the road to go to the bar from the cafe. After two drinks, Jagjit Singh had transformed into Honey Singh. His teeth were like this. Yuck! Bunny teeth! Bunny! The uncles dance at the parties. You are straight, aren't you? What do you mean? Straight? Like, I'm as straight as… I'm as straight as this. I don't know. I just know that I lose interest easily. So I keep trying different things. Like, now I am studying to be a ventriloquist. "Ventro" what? Congratulations, the girl is with you in your pad on the first date. Reading glasses, curly hair. I like her. Even I like her. I'm sure she's not here at this hour to play Ludo with you. So, loser, who will make the first move? What do you mean? I don't know who will make the first move. With you, it's always, "I don't know." All right then. -I don't know-- -Shut up! It's not your cup of tea. She's coming. She's come. Should I look away? Either destroy me Or light up my world Either destroy me Even if you are not Juliet Let me be your Romeo Just do me a favor Can I ask you something? There were two other guys at the café with chips packets. Did you call them there? Yeah. You looked richer than them. Imagine. Looks can be deceptive. You are fun when you're drunk. I know. Yes, I have an elder brother. I hope you don't mind, but what is your annual CTC? Just do me a favor Fulfill this desire of mine That was wrong, this is right Let me believe this lie Every breath of mine Is yours now, just say it Make it easy for me Make it easy for me Either destroy me Either destroy me Was it this guy? Two died, one missing. You safe, how? That man… Rubbish! I will drink this Sweet poison for you You may not be God But I'll keep worshipping you I will drink this Sweet poison for you You may not be God But I'll keep worshipping you I want to live with my head held high Take my life if you want to Bye. Why live like a caged bird? Set me free now Do me this favor Make it easy for me Either destroy me Or light up my world Either destroy me Chiku. Chiku. Chiku. Chiku. Chiku. Chiku. Chiku. Chiku. -What is your name? -Mini. And you are? Bittu. Should we go get Chiku? Where are your parents? Some goons came home and beat up Papa. Here is the note. Our maid found it. YOUR DAUGHTER IS WITH US. DON'T GO TO THE COPS IF YOU WANT HER ALIVE. Mummy was crying for help, so they took her away in a black van. I hid under the bed. And I am very brave. So I jumped out of the window. How did you get hurt? It's nothing. Look, I got hurt, too. Should we bandage it? Who is this? My daughter. Where is she? -In a hostel. -Oh, my! She's just a baby and you sent her to a hostel? It's an old photograph. Now she must be just like you. Which class are you in? 2B. She, too. Don't you have her recent photos? Are you very busy, as well? Then why did you send her to a hostel? Where is her mom? HOLY INCENSE STICKS His floating Taj Mahal has turned to ashes. So much for acting so high-and-mighty. Sattu bhaiya's orphans are on the streets now. Happy Diwali, bhaiya. Hey, hey… I want to go home. I want to go home quickly. But aren't there goons at home? Sorry, I was lying. Look, even if you bring the CM along, my answer will remain the same. -I don't know her husband. -Really? Show it to her. Here. And what about the 1,700 calls you made to her husband in the last two months? -We have the records. -And what does it prove? If you continue to harass me, I'll call the police. You call the police and we'll tell your husband about it. What then? When your husband gets to know that his darling wife, Sambhavi, is having an affair with Pinky's husband, maybe then you'll give your statement. -Mr. Kamal Nath? Hello. -Hello. She will give her statement. It'll cost you 20 lakhs. -To give the statement? -To save her husband. Then ask for 40 lakhs. Forty. Let's finalize the deal at 40. -Done. See you. -Forty… This society is disrespecting women. Here's one who cheats on his lovely wife to have an affair with a witch. And the witch's husband is pimping her out. What do I say? -Good women or bad, no one is safe. -What will we do now? What can we do? Your father organized a lavish wedding and got you married to this rich, respectful guy. -Am sure he can manage 40 lakhs. -Four… -Four… -Why couldn't he think of me? Now? Even kingdoms have been destroyed for women, and he's merely a manager. What will become of Babu now? He'll have to grow up as an orphan. No! I'm with you. He won't be orphaned. I… I'll take care of him, Pinky. I'm Aalu, after all. I… I'll take care of everything. Nothing is impossible for me. Come on. Just don't cry in front of me. After that, "I, Shruti Choksi, had sex with my boyfriend, Akash Chauhan, in an unknown hotel room." When you enter the hotel room, this device will immediately alert you to the cameras' exact locations. Please call me when you find them. -Won't you come with us? -What will I do there? One second. What do you mean by, "What will I do there?" It just means, what will I do there? I am getting married in four days, and I am not here to visit hotels. We won't do this. It's your duty. Duty! Are you going to teach me my duty? There were blasts in the city! Nine people are dead! Two corpses with missing heads. Three with missing limbs! We still can't identify the gender of two corpses. Sattu is still missing! A girl has been kidnapped, and a builder has been murdered! And, ma'am, my darling wife says, "Divorce me before you go!" And I am-- What is it? Hello? Yes, one minute. Where's the girl's room? Did you search the entire house? Any threatening phone calls? We found some newspaper bits. Letters were cut out of it for the note. Sir, this way. Here. Only those letters have been cut out. -What is this? -We don't know. -Who comes in this house? -Sir, besides us, it's only-- Only our maid. That's all. -Maid, driver, gardener, call them all. -Come on. How will I pay you if I don't have a business? What's the use of violence? I did tell Sattu bhaiya… Listen to me… Hey! Spare my shop… It's her old certificate. We got her admitted in Saint Thomas last year. You can go meet her. Tell her, "I am your father." "I am a criminal." "I went to jail when you were little." "I might go again." "Any day." You are confused. You are confused between ego and love. Your ego is hurt that Ruhi is away from you now. Bittu, this is not love. If you loved her, you would help us out of this problem. When we were together, I lived in fear. Now… Once again… I can't do it anymore. Hello. -Is that Bittu? -Yes. Bittu. I'm in trouble. They have taken over my parlor. And if I don't pay them back on time, they will kill me. It's final. Please help me. Please help me, I will… I will go away from Asha and Ruhi. With interest, I have to pay them 90 lakhs. Asshole, you missed work yesterday and decided to turn up today? You thought I wouldn't know. Do I look stupid? No, sir, I met with an accident… Accident? Does it hurt? What are you staring at? You want to hit me? Then hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hey, where were you all this time? Sheeja, say, "Peter Piper picked--" Peter, fuck you. Bittu. MISSING - MINI SHRIVASTAV PRIZE MONEY 50,000 I need a place to hide. Why? The police is looking for me. -What's his pulse? -70, sir. -Okay, and blood pressure. -151… Oh, my dear Oh, my dear Oh, hello, mister There are good days and bad days Now it's good… Was he with you in the ambulance? It's a strange case. The accident happened on the road, the ambulance was found on the railway tracks, and we found him on the river bank. Mr. Sattu, you escaped death once again. Amazing. Hello? Bittu is with that girl? I am coming soon. Oh, dear Oh, dear You're the wind You're a tigress You're the wind You're a tigress You're the wind You're a tigress, oh, dear You're the wind You're a tigress, oh, dear You're the wind You're a tigress, oh, dear You go, oh, dear You go, girl Oh, dear You're the wind You're a tigress -Greetings. -Greetings, Sattu bhaiya. He wants to write something. Pen. -Paper. -Paper. There. It's there. Why are so many people here? Go outside. -We are going to the temple, Sattu bhaiya. -Come on. To pray for you. You will be fine, bhaiya. Why doesn't this asshole die? Water, air, fire, nothing works on this guy. He will die this time. Just wait and watch. How much money was in that bag? Maybe one, one and a half crores. -Where's ma'am? -She must be around. Check. -Madam, give me some medicine, too. -What's going on? -What's wrong with you guys? Out! -My heart is going crazy. -Give me an injection. -Punks! Stop, please. -Why are the police looking for you? -Because I have been kidnapped. Who kidnapped you? -The police suspect me. -Why do they suspect you? Because the police think that I wrote that kidnapper's letter. Who wrote it? I did. I think your daughter has been kidnapped. Please save my daughter. -Please, sir, save our daughter. -Only you can save… Why? To make Mumma and Papa cry. And once I go back home, they will never leave me alone. So what next? What else? I'll have to go to jail. I have an idea. You can get out of trouble. We will call them and say that I kidnapped you. Yes, you look like a goon, too. Hey, open the door. Lady luck's not on your side But you always take it in stride True love's a total no-go Search the house. And life's become a bad game of Ludo Loyalty, that's a screen of smoke You break your piggy bank But you're still broke Everything around you is in shambles And life's become a bad game of Ludo Come on. Come fast! Are you sure there's no CCTV there? Costumes! Two stars or three? -See what suits you. -Three stars! -Like Salman's Dabangg. -Check the guns. I hope we won't land in trouble. All you can do is whine, eat, and shit. His brother-in-law said there are three officers and a lot of corruption money… How much? -Seven lakhs. -That's all we need. And it's easy. Make an entry in style in our uniforms, catch them with the girl, and ask them to pay up. -It's Murphy's Law. -What's wrong? -Rosy got married. -Oh, man! Okay, check with Kamala. Can Kamala really wear this? What are you talking about? What did you tell him? Mom and Dad had a fight. They are thinking of a divorce. I'm going to settle it. What if he calls your mom and dad? He won't. And even if he does, my mom knows everything. -She'll handle it. -Everything? Listen, my phone is ringing. Yes, baby? No, it's all messed up here. They are just not ready to listen. They are fighting like kids. -It's hopeless. -Only complaints for the last 30 years. I am sick of you. So? I told my family not to call you for my funeral. -Wait a second. Hold. -All right. You're not invited to mine. -I mean… -I'll marry someone else tomorrow. -Oh, God! -Who will marry you? You are useless now. This is too much. It's below the belt. Listen, I think they are fighting again. Don't call me, I'll call you. Okay? Okay, bye. Thank you. So where are we going? Sunshine. See, I told you. I remember. Red and white building. And the bed was tilted, too. My eyes have sworn, my love They will only dream of you Always, every day Every moment, every night Forever, my love My eyes have sworn, my love They will only dream of you Always, every day, every moment Every night, forever, my love My eyes have… Why would Shekhar be here? No, Mummy. No! How can I come, Mumma? I can't! No, I'm having fun here. I'm really having fun here. Why are you taking his calls? I have gone on three dates with that guy from Hyderabad, but I haven't seen him smile yet. I mean, he never smiles. Now I have one last hope. That guy from Delhi. Your timing is perfect. Every time, right after sex, your dating audition results pour in. So I don't get serious about us? Smart boy. What if I do? Why should you? Isn't it going well? That's what I am saying. It's going well. What's the problem? There's no problem. It's just that you… You know… That I am not rich? The problem is not that you are not rich today. The problem is you will never be rich. Good point. But, actually, I agree. It's difficult to be happy with less, but it's impossible with too much. This… This is the problem. Your attitude is wrong. The attitude is right, madam, but the times are not. Nothing. Let's go. You don't have to do it. If you're not comfortable, just say so. My wrong could be your right and your right could be my wrong. But, you see, there is a whore in every woman and a good woman in every whore. -So just focus on the whore in you-- -What are you blabbering about? It's just acting, Pinky. How do I tell you How much I love you? Even if I see your shadow I'd kiss it right away When I meet you My heart prays to Him May this day never end May the sun never set I just want to be with you Just be with you I will hold you close Always, every moment, every day Every night, forever, my love My eyes have… -Where is Sheeja? Did she call? -No, ma'am. -I have been calling her-- -Bed number four is an asshole. -He doesn't listen. Please handle him. -Why? What happened? He says, "There's a fly on your nose." "Swat it away or I'll shoot you." Why are you laughing? Hello. How are you today? How are you feeling? You can say whatever you like, I don't care. I'm quite thick-skinned. Take this off. There is no need for it now. I want a cigarette. If you have a cigarette, smoke will come out of your stiches. Just take off these doodads. Take them off. It's these doodads… that are keeping you alive. If not for them, you'd have died. Then let me die. Who cares if I live or die? I want to fucking leave. Shut the fuck up! I care. We're working day and night to keep you alive. If you want to die, do it outside. I won't let you die here. Sorry. I was a little loud. I am sorry, too. I was foul-mouthed. You have been wetting the bed for two days. Pee in this now. No. Don't you dare. I'll shoot you. -Don't! -You call me Mom. Why should you be embarrassed? Do it. A little more. Yes, do it. -Are you done? -Yes. Hey! I'll make so many holes… I'll make so many holes… Wait a minute! I'll make so many holes, you'd look like a water filter. Slap him. How dare you do this in my city? Let's go to the police station. Unless you want to settle it under the table. You… How dare you touch her? How dare you? -You look innocent but act like a rascal. -Don't touch me. -Drop the gun. -You drop it. -You do it! -You do it! -You do it! -You do it! Who is it? -You do it! -You do it! Let's go! 696,000. 698,000. -Seven lakhs. -Hey, it's just seven lakhs. -How much did you say? -Seven lakhs. You mean, 60? I mean, seven. Seven. But you had said 60. Not 60, I said 7. And it is 7 lakhs. Your tobacco-filled mouth turned 60 into 7. Bro, I had said seven! Total… -Wait a second. Where are you going? -I'm leaving. Everything is a mess now. It's your oversmartness that messed it all up. No, not my oversmartness. My stupidity messed up my life. Did I ask you to do it? Of course not! It's my husband who's in jail. -I came to you for help. -You could have said no. Both of us know very well that I can't say no to you. Have I ever since childhood? When your 12th grade exams were going on, I was hanging from the third floor, dictating the answers word-to-word. I failed the exam, but I helped you clear it. I love Amitabh Bachchan, but I dress up like Mithun for you. I've been rattling off his dialogues forever. I know people call me second-hand Mithun and laugh at me. But I don't care. Because you like Mithun. You never spoke like this before. Because I have never been so fucked up. No one dared to look at you in a wrong way. I made sure no one did. When your grandma had piles, who went to Haridwar to get her medicine? I did. I see. So it wasn't friendship, just favors. I'm not counting favors. You don't talk about friendship. You didn't even call me once after getting married. That's the problem with you. You are an emotional fool. -You don't think logically. -You are right. I am an emotional fool. You shot them, you killed them, and who is standing by you? Emotional fool. I will do it again. I will bring your husband out. I have some savings. I'll give it to you. Go and bail him out. And how do I matter? I am happy running my diner. Right? But I hope you are happy, Pinky. I will give you everything I have. Thank you. Anil Shrivastav? Your daughter is with me. -If you want to see her-- -Papa, help me! Help me! I hope you heard that. Now listen to me. If you try to go to the police, -I'll-- -Cut her hands off. -I'll cut her hands off-- -Break her legs. -Break her legs-- -Pry her eyes out. Pry… And I'll send them home. Did you get that? Ask for 100,000 lakhs. If you want to see her alive, arrange for 90 lakh rupees. -When and where-- -Show a little anger. I will tell you the drop point and time. This is your first kidnapping? Hello? I am arranging the money. It will take two days. Bring Ruhi back from the hostel. Nurse, administer the medicine to the patient on bed nine. Nurse, this machine is not working. Please check. Move your hand. Just move your hand. When I met you, my lonely life Has come alive again You are mine You were lost and I wondered Why did it happen? You are mine I found hope Where I never expected it to be What was never mine Is what my heart seeks now How the story has changed! You are mine A new melody is in the air Like spring is in the air How did my dream come true? I'm falling for you Just for you You are mine My heart is reaching out to you You are mine… True love is when you'll die for it. I know that she loves me, too. But she can't say it. It's my fault. How can she say it to a criminal… Especially a girl with two dimples, how can she say… "I love you." Once her husband is out, she won't even look at me. I know it well. But I'll still help her. Thank you. I'll destroy myself for her. Because, my friend… some relationships don't have any logic. They only have magic. Magic. You are mine It's 1,853,000 rupees. I'll pay the rest after your statement. -Shall we go? -Like this? In my nightie? To the police station. You want to change. She will change and come back. Sambhu! Where are you going? But my treatment is going on. What's going on here? What's the fuss? Hey… Wait up, Sambhu. My money! Hey, stop. Hey, stop! Hey, my money! Hey, stop! Stop! My money! Enough! I have done more than enough. I can't do it anymore. Rickshaw. Stop. Drop her at home. This is all I have now. I'm giving you this as well. Babu… Go on. Pinky! Pinky, wait! -Hello? -Where are you? -Who is it? -Your big daddy. Sattu bhaiya, hello. What are the updates? Where are they? Found them yet? That's what we are doing. Get them! -Get them! -Follow them! -Get them! -Don't let them get away! Throw them on the ground… Hello? When luck suck, everyone fuck. When luck suck, everyone… Fuck. Look, who is here. Hey, get that asshole! Hey, stop! Get them. -Stop! Get them! -Get in. Come on. Ma'am, please help us out. Go quickly. Go quickly. Go quickly or else they will kill us. Please save me. Let's go. Go quickly. -Go quickly. -Start the car. Hey, stop! This car… Who the fuck is going to fix this car? Stop! Stop! Hey, stop. Darling! My wife is here. Darling, they beat me up. Did you meet Sambhavi? Please go and meet her. They will kill me. Look how they have beaten him up. He's badly hurt. He won't get bail. I can give it to you in writing. -There must be some way. Anything at all? -I wish there was some way. Some big names are involved in this, ma'am. The law is helpless here. Maybe he can break out of jail. That's the only way. I need a small favor. Tell me. Who else could I have gone to? Tell me. I want you to help Babu's daddy escape from jail. Jail… All right. Thank you. Purnia Express. Coach number S7. I'll call you at 7:00 a.m., tomorrow. Weaving delicate dreams My weaver heart Oh, my weaver heart Tearing apart and stitching together My weaver heart Oh, my weaver heart Weaving a scarf of honor Or a muffler of hatred Or it weaves a stole of love Sometimes a duvet of love Or a sweater of gloom Weaving delicate dreams My weaver heart Pandey, listen. Call this guy from Holy Incense Sticks. Big room! TV, fridge, AC. No problem, ma'am. I will give you the biggest room. Charges. Twenty thousand plus GST plus EST. Thank you, ma'am. -Thank you. -No! The music of love is in the air It has blown me away Everything seems… Come here. So colorful In this colorless world Giddy at times or blooming away A happy twirl or it may lose it all Sometimes my heart dances Like no one is watching Silky at times or like muslin Prickly cotton or it may be velvety Weaving delicate dreams My weaver heart Wow! You are self-obsessed, right? Me? Really? How? This… Use these dialogues on stage. Why in the bedroom? It's to delay the climax. Do you understand? So we can go on and on. I'm a test match player, baby. I'm a Dravid, not Afridi. In fact, try it with your husband. Holy Incense Stick will turn into a torch. -Fuck you. -Hey, it works. What to tell you? Shall we drink? -Hindi? -Yes. I can't read Hindi. Read. You read! Okay. Nobody can do what you did. You know, my grandma used to say… "If someone helps you selflessly, keep them close for eternity." Right? Someone once told me that I am fun when I am drunk. Dude. Didn't you ever want to meet me? I wanted to, but then I changed my mind. I imagined you as a trophy wife. Your foreign vacation pictures on Insta with #Wanderlust. And you waiting for likes. Attending high-society parties with a fake accent and a fake smile. I imagined you this way. That made it easy to move on. You are taunting me, right, asshole? It's not what you think. Shekhar is my-- -Phone. -What? Phone. Baby! Talk of the devil. Devil? I WANT TO SPEND MY LIFE WITH YOU With you… Are you from Kerala? -Are you a Malayali? -Yes, I am. -Me too. -Yeah, I figured. Who's that? Boyfriend, husband, or brother? It depends on how much I drink. You are funny. Come, let's dance. Sure. Why not? Play our song. Let me show you my wedding venue. Villa at Lake Como. And Shekhar has booked two entire flights. Why are you giving me this sarcastic smile? You don't even have a passport. That's true. Cheers! -Bottoms up! -Bottoms up! What kind of song is this? Let's go. Come on. My hand is hurting. Slow down. Leave me! My hand is hurting. Let go. What's wrong with you? Are you my husband? No, right? Boyfriend? No! How does it matter to you if I dance? What happened? Are you missing Mummy and Papa? A little. They must be crying for me. When we get the money tomorrow, you will be with them, and I will be with Ruhi. But what will we do with the money? Well, we need that money to bring Ruhi… Let me explain. So, you love Chiku, don't you? But Chiku is with that boy now. So if you had enough money, won't you pay them and bring Chiku back? No. Why? Because Chiku is happy with that boy. I saw that. And if Chiku is happy, I am happy. What is it? Scratch my back. Why were you in jail? -Murder. -What? -It's a murder case. -Whose? You know that builder, Bhinder? Why are you laughing? What? Get lost, you murderer. What a nutcase! Couldn't you find any other way? Maniac! -What's going on? -Who are these people? -Let's go. -Where are you climbing on to? -His intentions are not good. -Let go or I'll kick you, bastard! Who is that? Mannu, watch it! I'll kill you. Shut up. -Are you ready? -Yes, I've just passed through S6. No, not now. Keep going, I'll tell you. Aalu, be careful! Why are you taking me so high? You're trying to save me or kill me? Get lost! Mini! Mini! What time is it? It's almost 6:30 a.m. Don't look here. Okay. What… How foolish can I be? Why did I get drunk last night? I don't remember anything. I don't remember anything. Total blackout. -What did you eat last night? -Chili chicken. You remember everything. How long are you going to deny it? Deny what? As if you don't know. Don't do this, Akash. My flight is in three hours, and I am getting married in two days. Let people watch that clip. I am leaving, even if we don't find the camera. Yeah, you are a master at it. The art of leaving. Who are you running away from? From yourself? -Both of us know that-- -Don't! Don't do this, Akash. Please! Please not right now. I have been taught only one thing since I was little. If you want a good life, if you want to be happy, you need a good husband, from a well-to-do family. That's it. I learned to sing, to cook, good etiquettes, good English, for what? Make-up, fashion, for what? Just so that one day, I would get married to a rich, handsome Mr. Perfect. And guess what? It's happening. And I am very happy, Akash. Can't you see? No! I know where I am going. Don't distract me from it. I LOVE YOU. I WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU. Hello, ma'am. Hello, Sheeja. Where have you been? I called you so many times. It was an emergency. I am fine, ma'am. I am okay. Where are you? I am staying in Hotel Paradise. Hotel? Alone? No, I am with Rahul. Rahul? Who is Rahul? Rahul is a friend. A special friend. I want you to meet him. Please come. I'll try to. Call your mother. Yes, I will. Let me look for a shop. Rahul, help! Help! Rahul! Give me a packet of cigarettes. -Hello? -Welcome to Hotel Paradise. -Hotel Paradise? -Yes, sir. Hey! No! I'm here. Bastard! You thief! Son of a bitch! Thief! You will come to meet me, right? -Yes. -Bring Ruhi along. Sure. A bull and a bullock cart! Carrying a tiny tot! A bull and a bullock cart! Carrying a… Hey, stop. Bittu! Stop! Hey… What are you doing, asshole? Just stop! Asshole! Shit, he locked it! What's the password? Paradise. It's close to the bypass. Okay. I'll share it via WhatsApp. Mr. Sukumar is coming with the force. They'll be here in 15 minutes. Shruti, you can leave. I'll handle it. No, I'll stay. Asshole! Take us to your room. Come on. How does it open? You asshole! Trying to pull a fast one on us! Bloody traitor! Rock him for a while. Here is some money. Keep it. There is a man in Sitapur. Call him. He will help you cross the Nepal border. Take care of yourself. Bloody asshole! Go on. Its gear gets stuck sometimes. Bye, Babu. Let's go? No… No cry! No. I won't cry. I won't cry. Pinky… Papa, the mobile has stopped working. -Is this the climax? -Yes, sir. They'll be here soon. -How much time do we have? -Enough to play a game of Ludo. Bro. Always before time. Were you a premature baby? Let's play Ludo. Well, it's fun talking to you while playing Ludo. Coming straight to the point. The good old question. -How do you define sin and virtue? -And you're back to square one. Okay, tell me this. -Were the Kauravas heroes or villains? -Villains. -And who were the heroes? -Pandavas, obviously. So when Yudhisthira died and reached heaven, he noticed that Duryodhana is having fun with the fairies. And he asked, "Where are my brothers and Draupadi?" The reply he got was, "In hell." -Sir, this can be explained. -Forget the explanation. Didn't you just say the Kauravas were the villains? Then why is Duryodhana in heaven? So what does it mean? That you can never give a straight answer. It takes a lifetime to understand sin and virtue. And you want a straight answer? Hi, baby. Why? I can come on my own. No, not now. Yes, I have given up. Can't you keep your ego aside for your daughter's sake? Yes, Papa, exactly. -That is not fair. -Not fair? Okay. Then you can go. And take your mommy with you! She loves to attend lavish weddings. In fact, she's very proud of you that you did what she couldn't. Marrying a rich and successful man. I thought we shared everything. But you kept such a big secret from me. Your clip is on the internet. Did you watch it? Baby, you are famous. 50 lakh people have watched it. He's the guy, right? You should have just come to me. I would have made it go away. You met with an accident? The police called me. I was so worried. Thank God you used my credit card or I couldn't have tracked this hotel down. I can't imagine what you've gone through. It's okay. Stop crying. It's okay. Don't worry about it. -Did you find him? -Yes. Okay. Which way is room 104? My orthopedic doctor is here. -Shekhar. -Akash. What? What's so funny? Sorry. Not for you, man. I'm very sorry. I don't know what's going on. I'm getting a call. Police. Hello? Hit it. -Hey, go get the car. -Okay. Control room. Come in, control room… Sattu bhaiya has been spotted at Paradise Hotel. At least five armed gangsters are here. Please send backup immediately. What a rotten day! Pee on me and shit on me, too! Police. Turn right! I said, turn right! There, we are stuck. We'll be running all our lives now. It's your fault. If you hadn't followed me, I wouldn't be in this mess. I'm talking to you! Listen, stop overreacting. I'm not the only man to do it. Everyone does it. All my friends do it. Even your uncle did it, but he never got caught. And, listen, you are no saint, either. I know everything. Your lover boy, Aalu, fucking moved mountains to save me. I know the deal. You must have rewarded him well. The truth is there is a devil inside each one of us. Just like the bubbles in a bottle of soda. All it takes is opening the bottle. -There was a time -There was a time -When I lived with the faith -With the faith -In this world -In this world -I'd built my heaven -My heaven This is how I fell in love And what came of it, love? And what came of it, love? One. Two. Even the movie is coming to an end. Please explain sin and virtue now. Be independent. Find it yourself. Okay, tell me this. What about Bittu? -Heaven or hell? -Heaven. Whatever his past might be, he sacrificed himself for his family. -And what about Sattu? -Hell. Without a doubt. Not that simple. He still has something to do. -Not fair, sir. -Life is not fair, bro. -Life is just like-- -A game of Ludo. Exactly. Whether you win or lose, ultimately the tokens have to reach home. Death is the only truth in life. Everything else is just a smokescreen. -What do you mean? -I mean, what you call six, might look like nine to me. What? Sin and virtue, good and bad, heaven and hell are just points of view, Chitragupta. God and devil, heaven and hell, they are just means people came up with to control this out-of-control world. Yamraj, you are confusing me. So are we just a figment of imagination? Our kids… and their kids… will lead… a lavish life. Come on. -There was a time -There was a time -When I lived with the faith -With the faith -In this world -In this world -I'd built my heaven -My heaven I need one last favor. Tell me. Who else could I have gone to? Tell me. That's how I fell in love And what came of it, love? -Hello? -Hi. Flight? I missed it. -Your wedding? -I broke it off. I have some conditions. I want an AC. A fan won't do. Proper bathroom, with a door. No jokes when I snore. Brush before bed and shower before sex. And why do you have so many plants-- I love you. My eyes have Sworn, my love They will only dream of you Always, every day, every moment Every night, forever, my love My eyes have Sworn, my love They will only dream of you Always, every day, every moment Every night, forever, my love My eyes have… How do I tell you How much I love you? Even if I see your shadow I'd kiss it right away When I meet you My heart prays to Him May this day never end May the sun never set I just want to be with you Just be with you I will hold you close Always, every day, every moment Every night, forever, my love My eyes have How do I tell you How much I love you? Even if I see your shadow I'd kiss it right away When I meet you My heart prays to Him May this day never end May the sun never set I just want to be with you Just be with you I will hold you close Always, every day, every moment Every night, forever, my love My eyes have… Subtitle translation by: Sheela Sijin Mathews
