Subtitles by explosiveskull Hey, come in, come in. God, the weather's horrible, isn't it? Yeah, absolutely. Take off your coat. Here, give me that. - So how are you? - Good. - How's school? - It's okay. Well, thanks a million for doing this. Girls? - Hi, Sarah. - Hi, Sophie. Isabelle? She's annoyed because I won't let her see Jaws. It isn't fair! - So is it a date? - Hmm? That you're going on. None of your business. No. It's just an old friend I'm having a bite to eat with. Can I get you some water to start? Yeah, and a glass of whatever the house red is would be great. Hi. Hi. We've gone there three years running, but we're getting sick of it now, to be honest - Well, not sick of it, but... - You could do with a change. - Couldn't we, Chris? - Yeah. - So where then? - I don't know. We were thinking Italy, maybe, somewhere along the Amalfi Coast? Positano I hear is nice. - Where? - Positano? - Right. - No, I didn't know it either, but a friend of my sister says it's very romantic. - Ooh! - It's all romantic there. They're a pretty romantic race, really, aren't they? That hot Mediterranean blood, isn't that what they say? - Jim has a bit of that in him. - What? Yeah, right. Jim works on holiday. - Do you? - Well, I work to commission, so if something needs to be done by a certain date, that's when it has to be done by. - Oh, I couldn't do that. God! - Me neither. When I'm away, I'm away and to hell with work. Are you a holiday lover at all, Chris? Chris complains when a holiday's coming up, don't you? Do I? You know you do. But once he's there, he enjoys it. That's often all it's a matter of, isn't it? Getting there? Oh, it is. I mean, straight away, you're in a different frame of mind. Oh, some of us, anyway. Gimme a break. I still enjoy myself. I know. And we do spend most of the day as a family. That's the best part, I think. Just hanging out as a family. It happens so rarely for us these days, to be honest. And yeah, it's always so lovely seeing Chris spend time with the girls. - What does that mean? - Hmm? I spend as much time as I can with the girls. I know you do. So why are you suggesting that I don't? I'm not. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you implying something to people that isn't the case. - Oh, Chris... - I don't think she was, Chris. That's what I'm fucking talking about. I suppose it shows there's often more going on in a marriage than people outside of it are ever aware of. True. Fairly ignorant all the same. Oh, absolutely. Be a prick in your own bloody house, you know? Martina was going on about that play again. - Right. - It sounds really good. What is it? I can't remember the name. - Who's it by? - I don't know. Do you wanna maybe go next week, though? Yeah, I suppose. You suppose? What, you want me to get excited about a play you don't even know the name of? It's a date, though. So? With me. Yeah, I suppose. Asshole. Yeah. You put the bins out, didn't you? Fuck. - You were talking shit! - I wasn't. You were, the three of you. "Chris always complains!" - When have I ever complained... - Chris! about spending time with you and the girls? - That wasn't what I meant. - Of course it was. Or neglected them in any way? Never. - Why are you acting like this? - Like what? And why do you expect me to socialize with people that I've no fucking interest in anyway? You know what? Do not make me go over there again. You're trying to put us together, make us those kind of fucking friends. I'm not! It's me and Danielle who are friends. Then be fucking friends and leave me and Jim out of it! Do you understand me? Or include Jim and leave me out of it! Either way, leave me fuck out of it! I'm going to bed. Good! I'll be sleeping in Sophie's room. What the fuck do I care? Still a lot of clouds, but with just the odd patch of rain and drizzle. It'll be mild enough with highs of around 79 or 10 degrees with mostly moderate southwest breezes. So did you get much homework? About the usual. - Ben? - No, not really. No? Have you maths? Uh-huh. - Sentences? - Yeah. So why are you saying, "No, not really?" - I don't know. - Because he's an idiot. Shit! What is it? Nothing. Damn! You're an idiot. - Again? - I know. Did you knock in to Mrs. Conway? Yeah, there's no one in. I can't come home, Jim. I told you already, I have a meeting with Stella. Actually, you know who I think has a key? Yvonne. Yvonne? What day is it? And she'll be in. No, sure, I'll leave it. You'll leave it? Why? - After the other night? - Oh, give me a break. - It'll be awkward, Danielle. - It won't be awkward. Look, I have to go, all right? Knock in or don't. - All right. - All right, bye-bye. Bye. Well, Dad? Hi. No, it was when you had your bathroom done, I think she needed it back, so the guy could get in and out. Listen, you're welcome to hang around here until she gets home. Ah, no. We wouldn't wanna get in your way. Don't be silly. What's the alternative anyway, wander the streets for the afternoon? Well, I was thinking we might go and see a movie. Well, if that's what you wanna do, then fine, but just so you know, you're completely welcome. Thanks, Yvonne. So what, you don't work Tuesdays and Thursdays? Yeah, just since recently, actually. Right, and how do you find that? Oh, it's great. I mean, even just in terms of commuting, you know? - Where do you work again? - Killester. So yeah, the fact that I only have to get out there three times a week now instead of five just makes an enormous difference. 'Course, you wouldn't have those problems, I suppose. Or am I being presumptuous? - Working from home, you mean? - Yeah. No, you're not, but working from home can present its own challenges. Really? Like what? Well, like keeping disciplined. Right. Resisting the urge to fuck around on the Internet. Sorry. Shit. Actually... - Isabelle? - Yeah? Are you guys all okay? Yeah, we're fine. Go on. Fuck around on the Internet. Yeah, or watch TV. - Okay. - Or go back to bed. Have you done that? Done what? Gone back to bed. Have you not? Maybe once or twice. You see? These are the fucking temptations. And how do you know? She told me. She told you? Yes. In fact, she even went so far as to ask my permission. As if I'll have a say in anything once I'm gone. Permission to what? To be with you. And did you give it? Of course I did. I want her to be happy. Although there is one thing I need to tell you about her. And that night didn't come up at all? - No. - I told you it wouldn't. You said it wouldn't be awkward. Was it? It was a bit, actually. Spending three fucking hours hanging around a stranger's house. She isn't a stranger, Jim. Oh, would you mind taking the kids to town someday this week and getting Alannah a new shirt for school? She's complaining the one she has is getting too small for her. Right. Yeah, sure, we might go in tomorrow. Thanks. So what else did you not like? - About the play? - Yeah. What else did you not like? Well? What? - How is it? - Fine. Does it fit? I wouldn't say "fine" if it didn't, Dad. I'm hungry. - Now, everything good? - Great, thank you. Dad. Oh, actually... were the wraps supposed to come with chips? They were, yeah. Why? Did you not get any? - No. - Do you want them now? No, that's fine. We're just gonna go now. So what do you want? Sorry? What do you want? Nothing. I just was wondering if I misunderstood the menu, that's all. Right. Actually, sorry, you know what? I hate to make a fuss, but is that the attitude you have to take? - What do you mean? - Would a simple apology not be possible without... - An apology? - Yeah. It's not my fault your chips didn't come with your wraps. - I never said it was. - It's the kitchen's. That's fine. I'm just saying, you know, out of, Jesus, common courtesy... - Ah, yeah. - What? Listen, I don't know what your problem is, but I've far more important things to be doing than dealing with this crap. Go and find someone else to fucking abuse, all right? Dad... she said the F-word. I know. Hey! - Oh, hey. How are you? - Good. Good. - You going home? - Yeah. - Cool. Hi, girls. - Hi. So where were you, town? Yes, getting a shirt for Alannah. I see! - What about you? - Post office. - Mam, can we get a treat? - No. - Please? - Dad, can we get a treat? I tell you what. We have some chocolate bars at home if you'd like one. - Sorry, is that okay? - Yeah, of course. What do you say, guys? What kind of chocolate bars? And did you complain to the manager? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I'm not the type that normally would, but this woman was fucking obnoxious, Yvonne. - No, she sounds it, all right. - And in front of my kids? No, I mean, there's a limit to the amount of that kind of shit you can tolerate, you know? Anyway... Dad! - Yeah? - Look at this. All right, hang on. Cool! Do you ever notice how once you start measuring time by the age of your kids... What, how quickly it seems to be passing? Yeah. Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, just looking at Ben there, I remember him being six or seven months old, and me cleaning his shit and thinking, "When is he gonna be old enough I don't have to do this anymore?" - And then... - Gone. Like that. I mean, eight, nine years... - And you're that much older. - That's right. - That's the scary thing. - Well, that's what I'm saying. Before we had kids, it seemed to go by so much more slowly. And now it's like, "What the fuck?" - I know. - What happened? I'll tell you what I find weird, will I? Whenever I look at photographs of the girls, like when they were younger, I kind of don't remember them ever looking like that. What do you mean? I mean, in my head, it seems like they've always looked exactly like they look right now, you know? Those younger kids are different people altogether. Or is that just me? It might be just you. Oh, right, fair enough, so... - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. I actually meant to say this last time you were here. Will you not judge Chris for that night at your house? At my... Oh, no, of course. It just I don't want you thinking or Danielle or anyone, actually, thinking that kind of thing is a common occurrence. - Okay. - Because it's not. Or that we're having problems, say, or... Right, no, I get you. - Do you? - Absolutely. Because, I mean, Chris is a really gentle guy, a respectful guy. We love each other an awful lot, Jim, you know? I mean, how are you and Danielle? Yeah, we're good. But you know how it is, though. - We all have our moments. - We do. I mean, don't we? I mean, does Danielle? She does. No, she does. - Well, there you go, you know? - Exactly. There you go. I'm sure there are plenty of you whom my advice would be to get booking as soon as you can. We're gonna turn the clocks back now, and go back, I think, something even more sedating now. Oh, man. This brings back memories. What of? Ah... Tell me. Nothing. There was this girl I used to know in secondary school. Samantha Nolan. Really? I was just... There was this one night at a disco, and she asked me up to dance. This is the song that was playing. I was always mooning over her, so... She must have taken pity on me or something. Did she not just like you? Nah. She was a couple of years ahead of me, so she was way out of my league. I tried to hang out with her afterwards. She wasn't having any of it. So it was a sympathy dance. I suppose. Or a consolation one or whatever. Better than nothing though. Mm. Hey, guys. Different kinds of flowers. Like what? - Well, like roses. - Okay. Like... He was looking in the drawer for something, and the press above him was open, so when he straightened up, he banged his head off it. Right. - And I laughed. - You laughed? Well, I didn't mean to. It just, you know... It kinda came out. But he got so fucking angry, Danielle. And that's when he did it. Were the girls there? No, they were in bed, thank God. I mean, I didn't realize he was hurt that badly, you know? - But to fucking hit me? - I know. I mean, fuck! It's all right. I don't know why he's acting this way. I don't. It's okay. It's all right, Yvonne. It's okay. - Done? - Yeah. I put the navy sheet onto the bigger bed though. - Did it fit? - Yeah. Oh, good. I thought it might've been too small. Thanks, Jim. I'll take them up in a couple of minutes. No problem. No glass for me? Yvonne has something to ask you. I'm sorry, Jim. It's just... I was thinking about the girls and school tomorrow. I don't have their uniforms, I don't have their bags. Oh, right. Do you want me to get them? Could you? I know it's a pain. No, that's fine. Sure, I'll go down now. - Be careful though, won't you? - What do you mean? Well, don't get into a fight. Gimme a break. So do you want to write me a list or something? Hey. And how long did you feel it? I don't know. Two years? You left it two fucking years? I didn't want to know if I had it. I didn't want to know. I thought if I did, I'd rather find out too late and just accept my fate, rather of having to go through all the fighting. The fighting? Exactly. What do you mean? - For my life. - Oh. Anyway, since I discovered that that's exactly what I've succeeded in doing. I've been a bit, as you can imagine... - Yeah. - a bit temperamental. Hence tonight. Maybe a little bit more than a bit. How is she? I don't know. She's upset. And the girls? You have to tell them, Chris. I know I do, but... they're just babies, Jim. And Yvonne, you know, how the fuck am I supposed to do it? How am I supposed to destroy their lives, you know? What fucking words... do I use? You're not to say anything either. - Jesus, I wouldn't presume to. - Promise though. - Promise? - Yeah. Okay, I promise. Not even to Danielle, right? When the time is right, I'll, uh... I'll do it. Hi. Hey. Are they gone? Yeah, Danielle took them. Why didn't she wake me? She said she thought you might need the lie-in. Do you want some breakfast? No, I'm okay. Some coffee? You're working. You know what? I actually need a break. Okay. This is weird. What is? Us being here alone. Oh. Without any kids. Feels slightly improper or something, does it? A little bit? Uh, maybe now that you've drawn my attention to it. Sorry. No, I know what you mean. If this was an Updike novel, we'd have an affair now. Mm. Have you ever had one? What? An affair. No. No. What about you? Thinking about it. I'm joking. Why would you have an affair? I don't know. - To punish him? - Chris. Yeah. Right. So... what happens next? Go home, I suppose. Is that stupid? No, not at all. I mean, I think you should talk to him. Right. At the very least, you know? Would you mind terribly if I went back up to bed for half an hour? No, not at all. God, take as long as you need. Would you like to come with me? - Yvonne... - Fuck. I know. - I'm sorry, Jim. - Hang on. Danielle, my friend and everything. Why the fuck would I say that? - Listen... - Jesus! I have to go, Jim. Hang on a second. Why the fuck would I say that? - Because you're emotional. - Christ! Listen. And upset and whatever else. Confused. I understand, Yvonne, all right? - I'm so fucking embarrassed. - Don't be. And don't think... Jesus! Don't think that I haven't, you know, thought about you in that way either. - No, you haven't. - No, I have. You haven't. You're only saying that to make me feel like less of a fucking fool, and God bless you for it Look, just wait a minute. Give me your hand. Just give it to me. Do you feel how fast that's going? Feel mine. Feel my breast. Fuck. Feel my nipple. Yvonne... I'm wet. Yvonne... Oh, God, I'm so fucking wet. That's silly because the demon is scared of the sword, and there's no way a demon would be scared of a sword unless is was powered, and it wasn't powered. It was just like one that's metal. That is a flaw, actually. All right, coats off, lunchboxes out of bags. Go on. Will you do my spellings with me, Dad? Yeah, in a minute. Just do your other jobs first. - Hello? - Hey. - Can you talk? - Yeah. Jim? Can I see you again? Yes. Yes, of course. Are you sure? I thought you wouldn't want to. I don't. I mean, in my head, I don't, but... No, I know what you mean. I've got this awful fucking knot in my stomach all of a sudden. So do I. I'm not sure how much of it's fear or how much of it's... - I don't know. - Anticipation? Yeah. What if I was to rent a room tomorrow? - A room? - In town or... Yeah. I'm in work tomorrow. Well, Thursday. Would you be okay with that, going there? No. Cool... No? I mean yes. Yes, I'd be okay with it. All right. I can't believe this is happening. Neither can I. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. And so when did she leave? Not long after. And what did she say? She said to say thanks for getting the kids out to school. That it? I don't know. She was quiet. I'll call her later. You do your homework, guys? Mm-hmm. Can I leave the rest of my beans? Ah, Ben, eat half of what's there. Good boy. What do you think? About what? Yvonne. What do you mean? A kind of discontentment, I suppose. Not even that. Sorry. Not even, because I am content. It's like this... constant fucking conviction that I haven't been getting what I deserve. That I'm undervalued. Undervalued by who? By me? By everyone. - Right. - At work. By the fucking world. But yeah, by you as well. But you're not undervalued by me. I know. You're valued more than you can imagine. I know, which is why what I did to you is so fucking unforgivable. - Chris... - It is, Yvonne. And to come home this evening, because I was fully expecting the house to be empty, and that's exactly what I fucking deserve. Of course it is. And to open the door and see their coats and their schoolbags in the hall... I need you. I need you. - I know. - I need you. I'm such a fucking prick. - You're not. - An idiot. Fucking hitting you? Shh. I'm a fucking scumbag! Do you wanna leave it? Jim. Do you? No. It's weird. - I'm terrified and... - So am I. Yet we've already done it. This is the... This is the premeditated version though. True. Jesus. I know. Come here. God, what the hell are we like? - Hi, guys! - Mam! - We made crystals today! - You what? - In school. - You made crystals? And Eleanor Donoghue got sick all over the floor. Oh, no! I'm gonna fall off! I'm gonna fall off! I'm gonna fall off! Then after the girls and I got back to the house, I had to go up to the bathroom and masturbate. - Yvonne... - I'm serious. That's how much I'm aching for you. Well, where the hell are you anyway? At home. Chris is collecting the girls from camogie. Oh, right. Are you aching for me? Yeah, of course. I can't believe it's Tuesday before I get to see you again. And what'll you do in the meantime? What do you mean? Well, are you gonna masturbate? Jesus. Stop, will you? Are you? Yeah, probably. Who will you fantasize about while you're doing it? Who the hell do you think? - Tell me. - You, of course. And what'll you fantasize about doing to me? And I so much wanted the yellow one. Right. I thought it was so fucking beautiful. But no. My sister got that one, and I got the pink. And I had such a fucking tantrum. Really? Oh, yeah. I mean, I was only six. Even now... Even with her gone these 15 years, I still feel so guilty about it. My poor mother. What? Nothing. You're lovely. This is lovely. What? Just being here. Just talking. I feel very close to you these days. Is it all right to say that? Why wouldn't it be? I don't know. I feel very close to you too. What if, next time we met, we did something risky? Like what? Like... went for a walk on the beach. Why? To be romantic. To be romantic? But... did we not say we wouldn't let things get beyond this room? We did. So? That's why it'd be a risk, see? - She said I could. - And what did her mother say? - She didn't ask her. - Shut up. So this is all theoretical. - No. - Until her mother's been asked, it is, love. Well, theoretically then, would you let me stay over? What do you think? Chris. Should we not invite Danielle and Jim down some night soon? - And Alannah and Ben? - What, for dinner? - Yeah. - And Alannah and Ben, Dad? - No. - Why? I don't know. So I can apologize for being so obnoxious in their house that night. - And, you know. - Right. What does "obnoxious" mean? Uh, kinda nasty. What did you do? - I was ignorant. - You were ignorant? - Yeah. - Of what? Of the fact that everything isn't all about me. Something we'd all do very well to remember occasionally. Huh? So what do you think? No, I suppose that's fair enough. I mean, it'll be weird. Yeah. And we'll have to be, both of us, careful not to refer to conversations we've had. - That's true. - Or things we've done. Like that time we had sex in the dunes. That time we what? - Come over here for a minute. - Where? - Just over here. - Jim... I'm not gonna go in there with you. You're joking. - It's the middle of winter. - All right. "That time we had sex in the dunes." - What? - My legs are fucking freezing. Do you wanna stop? God, no. Jesus! Oh, God. - You all right? - Yeah. Have nothing better to do? Than watch you get your hole, man? No, I don't think so. Would you not keep going? You're just deadly. Hey, give us a look at your fanny there, missus. - Ignore them. - Ah, come on. - You dirty fucking slapper you. - Jim... Who said that? I did. Your mother's a dirty slapper. Say that again? - Jim... - Look... Say it again. - No. - Terrible, isn't it? - Jesus. - So where did it happen? Lombard Street just around from a place I'm doing some work for. - Were you talking? - Just sending a text. - To me. - To Danielle. This fella comes out of nowhere and grabs it or tries to. As soon as he sees I won't let go, it was like bang! - God. - Right in the... No, I know, And off he runs down into... You know those flats down there? And did you tell the police? His face didn't even register. I mean, if he was sitting here at this table, I wouldn't recognize him. I would, of course, but you know what I mean. Added to which, I hung onto the phone. - Aren't you great? - Fuck you. No, you did well to hang onto it. - Didn't he? - Absolutely. Anyway, thanks for coming, after my behavior last time we were together. And of course, other things that occurred. You can't ever do it again, Chris. What? You can't ever hit her again. I know. - I mean it. Ever. - Danielle... No, no, no, that's fine. You have to be better than that. And I will. I will, and, see, that's... I wanted to make that promise, and to apologize to you both and to you again, Yvonne. - Chris... - No, seriously. And for the fact that it happened first and for the fact that you guys had to be such a part of it all in the way that you were. Okay. Is that okay? That's fine. All right. So will we move on to something less, I don't know, awkward now? Absolutely. Good idea. Hey, listen, um... I wanted to say thank you for not, you know, not saying anything about... Oh, right. No, of course. - How are you? - Yeah, I'm okay. But how are you really? Not great. But I'm okay, okay? And... are you ever gonna say anything? No, you know... But you know what it is? We're in a really good place at the moment, and I just feel like the later I leave it, the less time they'll have to spend fucking dealing with it. But I know. I do, I do. I will tell her. Just... Right. Well, look if you ever want to talk again or... - I appreciate that. - Anything. I appreciate that. Cheers. - Anyway, I'll, uh... - Yeah, sure, yeah. He says it himself. He's only really productive four, five hours at the most each day. So I'm lucky the rest of the time he's around and willing to take care of the responsibilities I can't. What? Nothing. Singing your praises. No, but it is about valuing what we have, isn't it? - Definitely. - 'Cause that's when the rot begins to set in in most relationships, yeah. It's like you were saying, Chris, you know, if you start with what you have, taking it for granted, am I right? - What's that? - Because you can't. Because, Jesus, we all have a lot of shit to be thankful for. I mean, don't we? The fact that someone, say, could get sick, or one of the children could get sick, it can happen to anyone though. So we just have to remind ourselves that... Or maybe you don't. - No, maybe you do though. - Remind yourself what? That your happiness is fragile, and we're all just hanging onto it by the skin of our teeth. - All right, enough. - What? Depressing talk. I don't wanna think about that. We're fine. - We're all fine. - All right. We're cool, thank God. Let's just open another bottle of wine. Dad, are you gonna be much longer in there? - Dad. - What? - I need to brush my teeth. - Use the other bathroom. Isabelle's in there. Are you doing a poo? Are you doing a poo, Dad? Dad, are you doing a poo? It's kind of confusing, I suppose, because now I find myself reassessing whether it ever was. Right. Proper love, like. Was it something else. Like what? Convenience, maybe? I don't know. The bond we had through the girls. You can just fall out of love with someone though. True. Without even knowing it, you know? Are you still in love with Danielle? I suppose I am, yeah. What is it? Nothing. - Yvonne... - Then why are you doing this? Why are you here with me? Because unfortunately... - Hey. - What? Look at me. Because unfortunately, what I feel for you is far stronger. Then what are we still doing in this fucking hotel room? Yvonne... - Just leave it. - I don't wanna leave it. Will you fucking talk to me, for fuck sake? I'm sorry. For what? All along I promised myself I wouldn't let it... But it's just sort of happened without my noticing. What has? Yvonne... How badly I've fucking fallen for you, Jim. And I don't wanna give you an ultimatum. I don't, so please don't think that's what I'm doing, but I just can't continue like this. I'm... It's become too fucking painful for me. So what do you wanna do? - I don't know. - Do you wanna end it? - Do you? - No. Me neither. You've no fucking idea how badly I want to be with you. But not like this. I can't anymore. Uh... so what are you saying? Are you saying that you'd walk out on Chris? Yes. - If you wanted me to, I would. - Yvonne... If you were prepared to do the same. Jesus. You're really putting me on the spot here, you know that? I know. I'm sorry. The last thing I ever wanted to do was put you on the spot. Hey. Hey. I didn't expect to get you. Right. I couldn't sleep. No, neither could I. All right. All right what? I am prepared to do the same. - Jim... - What? Don't say it if you don't mean it. Seriously. I'd rather end it now than... I don't wanna end it now. I don't wanna end it ever. - Are you sure? Because... - Yes. Well, neither do I. Okay. So are we still gonna see each other on Thursday? - Of course. - And we'll just... We'll have a proper, more, you know, practical conversation about all this, Okay. I love you. I love you too. See you Thursday. Hello? - Mr. Ryan? - Uh, yes. This is Ms. Hynes, Alannah's teacher. I'm so sorry. I was at a meeting in town. - That's all right. - The thing ran on. I just forgot to check the time. - You okay? - Uh-huh. Thanks so much for looking after them, Ms. Hynes, I promise this will never happen again. I'm sure it won't. Enjoy the rest of your day, kids. - Bye. - Bye. Thanks. I look forward to your message. To end, just hang up. Hey. Uh, me again. Just checking to see if everything's okay? It'd be great to hear from you, even if it's just, you know, a text or whatever. All right. Bye. - Are you listening? - Yeah. And Stephanie says, "Would Adam like to come? - Who's Adam? - Breda's husband. And Breda says, "I see him enough at home. Do you really think I want to socialize with him too?" Completely serious-like. Cheers. She says they haven't had sex in seven years. Seven? Jesus. I know. Which kind of got me thinking. What's this? I haven't a clue. It's kinda got you thinking what? Well, we could probably do with keeping a bit of an eye on our own relationship lately. What do you mean? Well, do you know when we were last out on a date, for example? When? That play we saw. - Really? - Yeah, I mean, that was a couple of months ago now. Do you know when we last had sex? - Um... - No? It was that same night. Okay. And does that not bother you? Yeah, I haven't seen you, you know... instigate anything either. And I accept that. God, I'm not blaming you, Jim. We've both so busy lately, it's hardly surprising. I'm just... you know? I'm just saying, the flames of our marriage could do with a bit of fanning lately. That's all. A bit of fanning? Yeah. What do you propose? What the fuck? And he said to apologize, but he just... - For not coming up? - Yeah. Oh, God, there's no need, Yvonne. He's just so many people to tell himself, you know? And is there anything we can do? At all? I mean, God, you hear about this kind of thing, but... - Don't you? - Hmm. But then it happens and... I don't know what to say, Yvonne. And will I... What? Will I get to see you? Jim... No? I can't even think about this anymore. I know. - He needs me. - Right. - The girls... - I know. I know. They need me. And so this is it. This is where it has to end. And what about after? After what? Jim... - I'm sorry. - Jim... I know. I'm sorry. I have to go. Okay. I'll see you. I'll see you. - Ten out of ten. - Uh-huh. Aw. It's beautiful, darling. - I didn't win though. - What? Joseph Carney got first. - And did he get ten out of ten? - Mm-hmm. Well, that's not fair. She should have let you share first place. Maybe she was annoyed at you 'cause of having to mind us. When did she have to mind you? The other day when Dad was late. Picking you up? Yeah, I don't know what the hell happened. How late were you? - About an hour. - Ah, Jim. I know, I just... I laid down inside for 15 minutes, just to rest my eyes, like, and when I opened them. That's not what you told Ms. Hynes, Dad. - What? - You told her you were in town. - No, I didn't. - At a meeting. You did. Oh, no, you're right. That's right. That's because I was kind of embarrassed about having had a nap in the first place. Why would you be embarrassed? I don't know. In case she thought I was lazy. - That's silly. - So you lied. Well, it was a white one though, wasn't it? - Still. - I know, but... - Still, Dad. - I know, I know. I know. Ready? Dad? Mam wants you. What's up? What's your code? What code? To your phone. Why do you wanna know? 'Cause I need to make sure of something. What? That you're not up to something I think you might be. Like what? Something like what? Like cheating on me. - Cheating on you? - Mm-hmm. What the hell are you talking about? Are you? Of course not. What the fuck? So what's the code then? - I'm not gonna tell you. - Why not? Because it's private and because what you're saying is nonsense. You really aren't allaying my suspicions, Jim, do you know that? Why the hell do you think I'm cheating on you? - I just do. - You just do? That's right. Well, I'm not, Danielle. So what's in the phone you don't want me to see then? Nothing. So why won't you give me the fucking code then? Why won't you give to me? The fuck are you up to, Jim? - I was. - Huh? I was seeing someone, but I'm not anymore. This isn't fucking happening. Who is she? - Was she. - Huh? - I told you, I'm not seeing... - Jesus, who was she then? A girl who works with a friend of Gary Mulhern. You wouldn't know her. A younger girl? A younger girl. You pathetic fuck! You're a fucking cliché, do you know that? Jesus Christ. And how long were you seeing her for? - Actually, no. - A few weeks. You know what? I don't wanna know. I want you to just get what you need and to go. - Danielle... - Now, please! Where am I supposed to go? What the fuck do I care? To her! - To her? - To hell! Who gives a fuck, as long as it's out of here! As long as I don't have to... to fucking look at you! This is when they contradicted him. Okay. There was the briefest moment of panic in his face, and I just... - My heart stopped beating. - 'Cause you knew. 'Cause I fucking knew, you know? Wow. And you're actually gonna go through with it? Yeah, well... What do you mean? Well, you're not just, I don't know, punishing him. No. God, no. It's over, Yvonne. I mean... Do you need to get that? Oh. - No, it's fine, go on. - We're finished. Okay. I think even he understands that now. And who was she? I don't know. Some woman that works with a friend of his. - A younger model, of course. - Oh, no. So fucking predictable. - How much younger? - I didn't ask. - Really? - No. Well, the fact of it hurts enough without having to know those fucking details. - How firm were her breasts. - Right. What kind of contortions was she capable of. Fuck that. I'm past it, Yvonne. Why? Would you? - Want to know? - Yeah. No, probably not. What? We're both gonna be alone. - Oh, God, I'm sorry, Yvonne. - What? As if my problems are anything compared to yours. - Stop. - No, but it's true. How is he? He's coping. And how are you doing? Yeah, for the moment, I am too. I mean, at this point, it's just about squeezing the last few drops out of the little time we've left. You wanna say hello? Okay. Here, try that wee one. Is it going in? - Hi. - Hey. How are you? - Okay. How are you? - Yeah, good, thanks. - We'll see. - That's good. Just doing a bit of gardening. Hey, girls, how are you doing? Hey, um... I just wanna say I hope Chris is doing okay. I mean, given the... Anyway, I know I'm being a bit, um, persistent, but I'd love to talk at some point, if you get a minute. I can meet you anywhere for however long at whatever time. I miss you. You know Karen. She'd be going on about, "Did I make the right decision not having kids?" With having had the girls this last few weeks, I'd say she feels... not that they haven't been well-behaved... but that she probably made the right decision. Hmm. She doesn't know what she's missing, does she? Did you ever cheat on me, Chris? What? Did you? I kissed someone once. Who? Laura McCabe. That time you were in Birmingham? Yeah. Okay. I almost went to her room with her too. But you didn't. No. Why not? Came to my senses. I'm sorry, Yvonne. That's okay. It's not. I even bought fucking condoms in the toilets. - Will you forgive me? - What about other times? There were none. Will you forgive me? Yes. Thank you. I'm glad you asked. - You're glad? - Yeah. Why? I suppose it matters, all of a sudden, how you remember me. Not that you'll think well of me. You'll think what you want, I suppose, but that you have no... questions about to who I was. Uh-huh. Or what I thought or felt. Okay. Deep down. It's weird, you know. I don't fell bitter at all. What do you mean? About this. There are people... Jesus... children who don't even get to grow up. Kids I went to school with who never made it out of their teens. You know, why did I deserve more life than them? I didn't. I don't. And these last however many years with you, Yvonne, and the girls... this whole adventure we've had, I fuck... I really loved it all, you know? So, no, I don't feel cheated because I really believe I've had a generous share. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes. Of life, like. A generous share. And more. Don't cry. I can't help it. - Give it to me. - In a minute. - Now! - I'm using it. - I don't care. - Mam. - Give me it. - Mam! Will you give her the bloody thing? Here. No, go on. Just hurry up. Hey. Hey. Long time no see. Jim... Can I talk to you just for a minute? You'll have to do it here. The girls are inside. Okay. I'm sorry about the phone calls, I am. I just... There's something I need to know. What? That you're gonna come back to me. Do you any idea what I'm going through, Jim? - I do. - You don't. I'm barely holding on to my sanity, - and you're demanding to know... - I am. If you're gonna be with me after he's gone. - After he's gone? - Yes! Do you have any idea how fucking insensitive you're being? - Yvonne... - How selfish? - I love you. - Right. I do, and... What the hell does that mean? - What does what mean? - "Right". - It means "I see." - You see? That's right! You say that as if it's something you didn't know. Let me ask you something. That first time we slept together, did you know my husband was dying? What? No. You did, Jim! What the fu... You seduced me, Yvonne. You're the one who came on to me. Out of... Yes, yes! Out of loneliness! Confusion about my husband, about his behavior, which would have been less confusing had I have known what you knew. - I promised him. - What? I promised I wouldn't tell you. You didn't have to fuck me. You didn't have to beg me to fuck you. Mam? - Yes? - Can we watch TV? Clean up your drawing stuff first. Did you never think about what'd happen once I found out? - I don't know. - You don't know? No, I didn't! - What did you think about? - You! - Me. - Yes! And of how fucking amazing it was to be with you. Jim, it's a terrible thing you did. Do you even realize that? And what about you, huh? - You told me you loved me. - Yes. - You wanted us to be together. - Yes, I did. To destroy our fucking families. Does he know that? - Mam, Isabelle's making me... - Does Chris know that? Go inside, love. Please go away and leave us alone, will you, Jim? - My children's father... - Mam! - This is my family, Jim. - I wanted to be... Are you deaf? Are you deaf? - Mam, who is it? - Go inside! Please go away and leave us alone. Please! You got me fired from my job, you know that? Oh, Jesus. Jesus, yeah. Listen, last thing I wanna do is have a fight, do you mind? What can I get you? Two gin and slimline tonics and a vodka and Diet Coke, please. You got yourself fucking fired. Look, we're back to the same fucking thing. I accept that it wasn't your fault. - You accept it, do you? - Yeah. - Why did you say it was? - I didn't. All I did was point out that the fucking chips never came. Why is that my responsibility? - It's not. - Exactly. But you have other responsibilities. - Like what? - Being polite to customers. I mean, how long were you there for? - In the job? - Yeah. - A year. - You lasted that fucking long? - Fuck you. - Something you need to learn: The customer is always right. Is that right? Even when he's an asshole? Orla, are you coming or what? Hang on a minute. Even when he's an asshole? You saying I'm an asshole? - Yeah. - Orla. You know what? I'm gonna hang on another while. - Really? - Yeah. I'll give you a shout tomorrow, all right? - Okay. - Yes, you're an asshole- - See you tomorrow. - See you. Complaining to the manager over a little... - the smallest disagreement. - The what? Jesus, you just don't talk to people that way. All right. Lighten up, for God's sake. Lighten up? See, this is the fucking... Don't say "lighten up" as if I'm the one with the problem. - But you are though. - No. You fucking are. All right, look, will we leave it? - Huh? - We leave it. If I go now, I can catch up with my friends. Or we have another drink. Well, I'm happy to have another drink, if only to convince you that being contrary isn't being rude and fucking abrasive isn't... I'm not always rude and abrasive. - No? - No. Or contrary. Well, I fucking hope not. What is it, same again? - Hey. - Hey. How are ya? Shit. I'm sorry I haven't been in. That's okay. It was awkward, what with what happened with me and Yvonne or between us. Don't worry about it. I'm sorry I told her you knew I was sick. That's all right. It just kind of came out before I knew what the hell I was saying, you know? What's wrong? I'm ashamed of myself. Don't be stupid, will you not? When two people fall in love, there isn't very much either of them can do about it, really, is there? No. And you are in love, aren't you? Yeah. I know I am. Now she is too. How do you know? She told me. - She told you? - Yeah. In fact, she even went as far as to ask my permission. As if I'll have any say in anything when I'm gone. Permission to what? To be with you. And did you give it? Of course I did. I want her to be happy. Although there is one thing I need to tell you. Okay. About Yvonne? No, about you. That your phone? - Hello? - Hi. Just ringing to tell you that Chris died last night. - Are you there? - Yeah, yeah. Don't know when the funeral is yet, but I'll send you a text when I do. Okay. Are you all right? What is it? A guy I know died. Was he a friend of yours? - I have to go. - Okay. We had a good time, didn't we? Yeah. Well, I did. Yeah, no, so did I. So do you wanna get together again maybe? Yeah, I don't know. You don't know? I, um... Was what we did not just like a one-night thing? Oh, is that what it was? - Well, it... - No, that's fine. That's fine. I'll see you around. Don't be like that. Listen... Fuck off, will you? Go on. - Fair enough. - Fucking asshole. It was nice having your miserable, pathetic fucking excuse for a miserable fucking cock inside me! And he always cared how other people were. I mean, you know that. I mean, even as kids, I remember because you'd expect the case to be the reverse, particularly with kids, but no. I remember one time our cousins came over, - Patsy and Pudge. - Okay. And Patsy was really upset... How are you? My God. Good. It's so nice to see you. This is Robert. - Nice to meet you. - You too. - So, you and Jim... - That's right. - I see. - That's okay. Just one of those things we have to explain to people every once in a while. You know me and Lisa broke up. Oh, that's right. That was a while ago now though, wasn't it? Still, though... - Isabelle. - Yeah? - Be careful. - Okay. And watch your sister. Where is she? Sophie... Be careful. Okay! Sorry, Joan. We just kind of knew each other just from around the building. We'd not talked, really, but... So it was more a mutual admiration type of thing. Not exactly, but I can't deny I found him handsome. - And what about you, Robert? - What? - You think she was gorgeous? - Martina. Well, you are bloody gorgeous, Danielle. Did you? You don't want to move on, of course, but what the hell choice do you have, you know? And then one day, you're like, "What the fuck was all the anger about?" You know, the fucking rage or whatever. Dad, can we talk to you for a minute? - Yeah. - Outside? Sit here. Okay. Okay. We have a problem. Uh-huh. Mam has a boyfriend. - Right. Robert. - Right. Is he nice? Well, that's the problem, you see. - He isn't? - He is. He is, and we like him an awful lot, but that kind of makes us sad. Doesn't it? Because you're our dad, you see, and it feels like, if he's your enemy, then it's like we're betraying you. But he's not my enemy. No? Does he make your mam happy? Yes. And you like him. - He's so kind. - And funny. And funny. Well, then that makes me happy. Are you sure? Because you kind of look like you're gonna cry. I thought of poor Chris, suddenly. That's all. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, son. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, love. - I remember when Mam was dying. - Right. She was talking about the things we did as kids that meant the most to her, and she said the mornings he'd wake her by blowing softly on her eyelids. I mean, he was only two or three at the time, but she said to be woken in such a lovely, gentle way... That's okay. And to see his little face smiling down at her, she just... - That's okay. - She... Fucking prick! Jim! Jim! I love you more than anything. Telly! All I want is for you to be happy, love. - Shurrup, telly. - No, you don't. - Why don't I? - 'Cause you're a wanker. - I know I am. - Telly! I know, but I won't be again. I promise you here and now. Do you hear me? Telly, will you shurrup? You shut the fuck up, stupid fucking bitch! It can't hear you! The telly can't fucking hear you! My fucking rib is broken, I know it. Look at my face, for fuck's sake. - Well, you deserve it. - I know I do. That's what I'm saying. When we get ourselves fixed up, we'll go home and we'll just be good to each other, yeah? - 'Cause I love you. - Ah, telly. Shut the fuck up, I told you! Jesus Christ! Girls, come on, it's time to get moving now. And she says that blond hair's better than black and that red hair is the worst. - But Stephanie said... - It is the worst. - No, it's not. - No, it's not because Stephanie said that because it's the rarest... - Love you, Mam. - Love you, Mam. Love you, girls! Thanks! Thanks, Patricia! My God, that's some weather. You okay? Do I hear a click? Do I hear a second click? Can we see Jaws? Do I hear a second click? - So is it a date? - Hmm? That you're going on. None of your business. No. It's just an old friend I'm having a bite to eat with. Do you like him? Do I like him? - Yeah. - Why do you ask? 'Cause you're blushing. Am I blushing? Sarah, you have way more interest in my social life than I think is appropriate. Can I get you some water to start? Yeah, and a glass of whatever the house red is would be great. Hi. Hi. - And where do you live now? - Rathmines. Right. - You? - Killester. - Oh, really? - Yeah. We've only there a few weeks, so, you know, there's still a lot of unpacking, etcetera. - Right. - There's settling in to be done. And are you still in... What is it? Brophy's. I am. Though I'm back to full-time now. The necessity of being a single parent. At least you don't have as far to commute anymore. That's true. Well, that's mainly the reason we moved out there. - How are the girls? - They're well. They're well. They miss their dad. Right. How about your guys? Or shouldn't I ask? It's fine. They're fine. I get to see them every second weekend, which is... better than not at all, I suppose. Danielle and I remain polite to each other, for their sake. And is she still with that guy? - You don't ever see her? - Not really, no. Robert. She is. He's okay. They're in Blackrock. Really big house out there, so she didn't do too badly for herself. Not that that kind of stuff was ever important to her in any case, but still... Go there to pick up the kids. I feel like a tramp. - Do you? - Sometimes, yeah, a little bit. But I can't say he isn't... he isn't crazy about them. I sometimes kind of think she knows it was me. - Danielle? - Mm-hmm. - Really? - Or suspects. I don't know. She just... I felt she really withdrew from me after the funeral. - Right. - Like consciously, you know? She never said anything to you, did she? No, well, that particular subject wouldn't come up in any case, you know? Are you seeing anyone these days? No. Well, actually, I went out with a guy quite recently. Right. Though when I say "went out with," I mean like two or three dates. Why? What happened? Was he an asshole? You understand why I had to do what I had to do, Jim. What do you mean? Regarding Chris. Oh, of course. Oh, Yvonne, don't ever think that I... Yes, I mean, what else could you do? I know at the time, I was... what was I... - childish about it. - You weren't childish. Or selfish about it. I was, Yvonne. But no. No, you did the right thing. Please don't ever think that I don't think that. Okay. - Oh. - The risotto. That's me. Thank you. - And the monkfish. - Thank you. Enjoy. Because, see, what happened with this guy was... - the one I was seeing. - Right. Was... It's stupid, but... I couldn't get it out of my head that if I slept with him, I'd be cheating on you. I see. Is that crazy? I don't know. To feel I'd be doing that? It probably is. I bet it is, but... I just couldn't do it. Because my feelings for you I realized hadn't lessened. - You know what I mean? - Yvonne... No, hang on a minute. At all. They'd just been sort of, I don't know, put aside, I suppose. But if you wanted... If you wanted, we could start again, and it could be something we wouldn't have to feel compromised by or guilty about anymore or mistrust because it isn't built on something real or, you know, or honest. Right. Or fair. 'Cause it'd be only us. 'Cause there'd be no Danielle or Chris 'cause... Right? 'Cause it'd be only us. And it could be right now. Jim... Yeah. It could be right now. Go away. I... Go away, go away. Did you fuck her? - What? - Did you fuck her? - No, I didn't fuck her. Jesus! - Are you going to? - No. - Yeah, right. - Orla... - Yeah, right First fucking chance you get, you'll be in her knickers. - No, I won't. Listen... - Yes, you will. Get the fuck away from me, you scumbag! You knacker! I fucking hate you! And what was it like? - The place itself? - Mm. I don't know. It was nice. Was it posh? It was fine. Sure we'll go there ourselves some night, if you want. Yeah, I'd love that, actually. And you didn't feel anything for her? No. Are you sure? - Orla. - Sorry. I am sure. So what did you feel? I just felt... that was then, you know? And this is now. Yeah. I'm sorry about the way I acted. That's okay. - Get up and dance with me. - What? Come on. Fuck that. I hate this song. You hate it? I think it's a brilliant song. All right, we'll pick another one. How about that? What about this one? - What. - Do you like it? - It's all right. - Well, come on, then. Tell me something nice. Like what? I don't know. Tell me you love me. I love you. I love you. Subtitles by explosiveskull
