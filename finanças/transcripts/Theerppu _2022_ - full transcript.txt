Hail Lord Ganesha! A ritual once confined only to Maharashtra and Bengal; ...now they've brought it here too. Total crap! The colour of our English channel... ...and the colour of this goddamn sea here. Terrible! Drainage, waste, trash and what not! Shucks! And if they murder someone, those corpses too..! Even 'God' gets dumped in this sea now. It's a real tragedy, you know! The eco-system is totally gone! -Hey Pawan! -Yes, sir! Clear everything. Not one speck of trash should remain there. He's calling it trash, bloody dog!! Did you hear me? Forgive me, Lord Ganesha! I heard you! "I heard you, sir!" "Heard you, sir!" A sea that brings everything from there over here. Who's coming for dinner? Who's coming for dinner? Oh! Parameshwaran Potty. My old school friend. You postponed our return trip by three days, saying that you have a most important business meeting, for this silly get-together? That too, during this Covid pandemic? It's not a silly get-together, Mythili..!! It's a serious business meeting! He's struggling now with plenty of debts and losses. I have to help him out. We shouldn't forget our roots... and our old friends too. That's not an essential Ramkumar line. "Help", "Our roots"... Without some kind of prize money or trophy, you don't take so much effort usually. My husband, Mr. Ramkumar Nair. Now, listen... Just play the host well, and do your damn business. Got it? There must be someone else with him. Huh? Who is it? Sir! What is it? Sir, can I ask you something? Tell me. You know... My leader, the most respected Mr. Lakshman Kothadia, is coming to this city today. So? If you give me permission, I can go there. Get lost! We have guests coming today. Go and do your work. -Go! --Okay, sir. Bloody Pawanaputra Bhede! His name sounds like some king who fought and lost against the British. He's named after our God. Otherwise, I'd have gone for his throat. Hey Pawan! Bring me a cup of tea! Yes, sir! âª This night, âª âª This very night! âª âª The moon was shattered, âª âª And moonlight, erased, âª Namaste, countrymen! I am Arnab Goswami, and you are watching, "The Nation wants to know!" My dear countrymen, after eight days, I have come out of the prison. Hey! Can you reduce the volume of the TV? What, sir? Can you reduce the volume of the TV? They won't listen to me, sir. They are North Indians. They are our only customers during this Covid period. They don't need music or dance now. They just want to watch that fellow! Then... ask them to shout less! If the cops come hearing this noise, all of us will be thrown out. You know, right? Social distancing! What social distancing, sir? These guys have a convention today, at our boat house grounds. They have come for that. Please adjust, sir. I can bring the drinks to your room upstairs, sir. It's alright. Get me the bill. And pack a pint bottle too. Sir, you'll be checking out tomorrow, right? Yes. âª This night, âª âª This very night! âª âª Where History once slept and rose in peace.., âª âª Recent wrongs have castled up âª âª Old wounds fester here, now, âª âª By the salty waves of the sea of sin... âª âª On this night.., âª âª Thisâ¦ very night! âª âª If happenstanceâ¦ joins hands with destiny.., here, âª âª Itâs Apocalypseâ¦! âª âª That blood-stained finale, âª âª itâd be unimaginable! âª âª Suchâ¦ is the swelling surge of the past.., âª âª The battle song of Karma! âª âª The end of story? âª âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª âª This Night, âª âª This very night! âª âª The moon was shattered, âª âª And moonlight, erased, âª âª On this very nightâ¦! âª I'll try asking here. Brother, where can I buy a lamp as a gift? Go straight and then take a right turn. Straight and then right? -Yes. -Thank you. Hey Potty! Your Holiness! Hey! Wear this mask! Abdullah Marakkar! Hey specso! You little devil! You and your mask! A much more deadly virus is right in front of you! I saw a beautiful hand. Must be your better half, right? Hello! -What's your name? -Her name is... Prabha. He is an old friend of mine. Abdullah. What? Old friend of yours? Are there 'old' and 'new' among friends? Where are you going, searching for a lamp? I'm going for a colleague's house-warming function. That's why... -Where are you based now? -Thiruvananthapuram. I came here to attend this function. Thiruvananthapuram? If you have to fill petrol and drive all the way till here from Thiruvananthapuram, your colleague must be no ordinary guy! Well, he is a close friend. Apart from me, you have only one friend here, right? That bugger! That bloody son of a gun, Ramkumar. But he has been in England for the past 18 years. This is another friend. I told you, right? My colleague. How's your mother now? Mother! So, you remember.... right? She died.... a week back. Didn't you go to your hometown? To the place where your ancestral house stood? What hometown! It's all gone! Wiped out! When I got out of the mental asylum, the first thing they told me was... ... not to go back to old places. Nostaliga is not meant for lunatics, apparently. Mental asylum? But... Abdu hasn't forgotten old wounds, by the way. I became a lunatic because of that wound, right? He's not here, right? Who? Ramkumar Nair. Do you have his number? No. He had forgotten us long back itself, right? It's been around 12 years since I spoke to him. Even if you have his number, I know that you won't give it to me. But you should inform him... that my mother who trusted, fed and took care of him and his father, is no more now. Come, let's go! Oops! Hey Missus! I am not a troublemaker. You can buy the lamp and go at your own pace. I'm leaving. I was just... Brahmand Solutions. That's an awesome name. Is that your number? No, no. This one... The office number is different. Only the landline is functioning now. You bloody veggie! Oh no! Forgive me! Please forgive me! I didn't know! Well, do we really have to buy a lamp? This is a business meeting, right? Of course! We have to! Let his heritage resort have a lamp from us. Who is he? Indecent fellow! No mask... and he was reeking of alcohol. Ramkumar, Abdullah and I studied together in Moothedath school here. Have you studied here, Potty? My father was the temple priest here at a Lord Narasimha temple, long back. I studied here from my 4th to 10th grades. You're still sweating quite a bit. No way! Seems like he was the school bully back then. -You got scared, right? -By bully, you mean? Rowdy! Oh! That bully! When he asked you about Ramkumar, why did you lie to him? Err... Well... It will be a problem if I say it. Why should I... Don't go there and say that we met Abdullah on the way, okay? I won't say anything. What was the issue between them? Tell me that story. I'm getting bored. Dad! Read what's written on that poster. Poster of the movie 'Midhunam' Don't humiliate me, Abdu. Please try, Dad. The first letter is 'M'. The second letter... ... looks like Taj Mahal turned upside down. Doesn't it? Do you like Mammookka (Mammootty) or Lalettan (Mohanlal), Uncle? Nothing like that, son. If they act well, I like both Ikka and Ettan. Whom do you like? I like Rajinikanth! -Wasn't it Kamal Haasan? -Well, I changed sides. Why? Style! Isn't that Mr. Nair? Yes, Dad. Come and get in, Nair. Ah! Basheerkka! - Come, Rama. - No, Dad! Let's keep walking. Come on! -Abdu, you go to the back seat. -Okay, Dad. Hey! We were on our way there. -Abdu! -Yes! Rama... Come, get inside. All of you are here, huh? -No. I'll get in through the other side. -Okay. His bloody car! Show-off! My umbrella! Peace be unto you, Basheerkka. You needn't greet me like that, Nair. You can say Namaste. If so... Eid Mubarak, Basheerkka. Eid Mubarak! Raman gets chicken biriyani only once in a year, for this festival of yours. Right, son? Advocate Menon must have reached, right? Yes, Menon has reached. I came out with Abdu, making Menon wait at home. Abdu couldn't go to school for the past two weeks, due to typhoid. So, he wanted to get some notebooks from Potty. On the way back, I brought Potty also along. Potty? Is the High Priest home? No. He has gone to the temple. -Oh. -It's the temple festival, Nair. Don't you remember all this? Where do I have the time to think about all this? I'm neck deep in debts. You know, right? Dad, they are here. Allah! Hey Kalyanam! Don't call him that! Kalyan. That's his name. Dad let me bring the bat and ball. Come, let's play. Menon! Did you get bored, sitting alone? -No. -Come. Come, Nair. -Rehana, Aisha.. -Yes, Mom! What is it, Mom? -Take this there, children. -I'll take this. Don't take that. -Here, take this. -I'll take this. Rehana, serve Sarbath to them. Which country is this company from, Nair? Advocate... France. -The name is Accadio. -Oh God! All over the world, in all the seven continents, they have hotels. They are coming to our town too. Isn't that a matter of pride, Ikka? I like mutton. But since you people prefer chicken, we decided to go with Chicken Biriyani. Where is Potty? Different people have different habits, right? We shouldn't feed the priest's son, at a table where we're having mutton, chicken and beef. He's having his vegetarian lunch inside. Did you take your medicine? Hey! Have your lunch, son. Give him this glass of water. Have your food, Nair. Ikka... The party from France has arrived. They are staying at a big hotel in Kozhikode. Once you nod yes, they will be here. They have brought a white lady, especially for this. -Some more? -No. If it happens, this will be their first venture in Kerala. And you will be the one who benefits from this, Basheerkka. Your entire future will be secured in one go. I'm aware of that. But it's the land where my ancestral house stood, Menon. It's around 400 years old. You know, right? Jumma prayers were offered here, earlier. The property is only around 8 acres. That's the only asset I can leave behind for my children. I have two daughters! And I have a heart problem too. We're hungry, Mother! I feel really exhausted while walking now. We've been seeing each other since the time we were running around in our underpants, Basheerkka. Do you have to explain all this to us? Right, Menon? They just need the four acres of land by the beach. And you'll get a good price too. You can use it to buy another property, or deposit it in a bank. However you look at it, it's profitable. If not anything else, if you want to use that money to renovate this house, you can do that too. There's no point holding on saying that it's a heirloom, Basherrkka. If you can't maintain it properly, all this is just stone and sand. Don't worry, Basheerkka. What's the revenue that this property generates now? Just the coconuts and shoots from these odd coconut trees. If you want to chop off all these coconut trees at this old age, and start cultivating new crops, it's not possible because the wind here is salty. Though you're a Marakkar, since you've never really gone to sea, even fishing business won't work for you. That's true. The foreigners have come here especially because... this property has such a beach frontage. When there's such an opportunity, if you don't sell it for a good price, you'd regret it later on. I'll tell you one thing. The coastal rules are going to change. That's why the foreigners are in a hurry. Once the law changes, not just them... Even we can't do anything. If they leave, you won't get a fair price for that part of your land. Remember that! That's not what I'm thinking about. I wanted to ask this to you. How come the foreigners decided to buy this, all of a sudden? That's something which hasn't happened so far. Oh! So you didn't know? No. Who is our Prime Minister now? Narasimha Rao. He has initiated an exuberant phase which has never happened in this country so far. Have you heard about 'globalisation'? No. Globalisation means that... One. The foreigners will give us cash in hand, to run their business in our country. Two. We accept that money and run the foreigners' empire, right here. Three. It will fill the pockets of the foreigners and us, at the same time. That is globalisation. How is Narasimha Rao? How's that? But... like Musaliyar said... this Rao just watched silently with his hands tied, when that mosque was demolished. How can he be at fault for that? If so many people make up their mind to do it, what can the Government do? Enough, sister. My stomach is full. Aisha! Careful. Aisha, dear... Rehana... Come here, girls. Wear your Hijab properly, clean your hands and go. Whom do you wish to marry, Rehana? Aamir Khan. -What about you, Aishu? -Salman Khan. You needn't take Muslim names alone, out of your fear for me. Take the names you really like. -Shall I say it? -No. -Shall I say it? -No. She likes Aravind Swamy. -Who is he? -I have no idea! Heard their wishes? Is it possible... ... if you hold on to this field which has only weeds, bushes and dry coconuts? Hey Ram! Throw it at his leg. Come on! Throw it! Come on, Ram! Pace! Pace! Malcolm Marshall. You're finished, Abdullah! We are with you, right? We just need your signature, Ikka. And you needn't do it blindly. We'll bring the agreement, and Advocate Menon will read out every word and every letter to you. You need to sign it only if you're satisfied after listening to it. I told you, right? If this sale happens, it will benefit us too. Even after all these years, I'm still not well settled, Ikka. My only house is mortgaged. I can't afford the rent of the house in which I'm staying now. I'm sinking! Neck deep in debts! I need to save Ram at least. How's that? And then? Then... nothing more! Ramkumar's resort where we're headed to now, is situated on that property. When we go there with this lamp, he will instantly understand that we're going there after talking about all this. He's a bloody shark! So, forget whatever I told you so far. Yeah, right! As if I have no other job than remembering this flashback! We're neck deep in debts. I just hope Ram makes a huge investment. Then, don't ask me anything more about the past. Understood? Don't tell him that we met Adullah Marakkar. You make sure that you don't blurt it out. Me? So... where are those two girls? I don't know! Where was Abdullah working? He was in Mumbai. He was in a mental asylum, apparently. It would be a surprise if he didn't go crazy. Tall, Latino, Ebony, Dusky, MILF... These are your current favourites, right? Fair enough! Or rather, unfair enough. Psst! Is this why you said that this one's better than the resort at Southampton? We don't have to give the parasailing option to the guests here. That's for sure. The mosquitoes can take them parasailing. The window netting team will come day after tomorrow. I've arranged it. My dear man, our first customers are coming this weekend. It's a high profile entry. I'll manage that. You don't worry. I have to worry and I will worry. Accadio looks for my signature in the quality check documents. Not yours. Is it? If that's the case, you've taken the quotation for the CCTV installation, right? What's happening with that? Isn't it part of quality check? Isn't that a basic need of a luxurious resort which has relics worth at least a millon dollars? I'll get it installed. But that will be the least of my priorities. First, you install a mosquito net. I'll get the CCTV installed after that. Bloody shit! Accadio Saket. What must be the meaning of it? Accadio is a French word. Saket is a Sanskrit word. He's quite impressive! Isn't anybody around? Let me check. Hello! Hello! Hail Lord Ram! Yes. Ram! Is he inside? -He was just greeting you. -Is it? Park the car over there. -Over there? -Yes. I understood what he said. I was just pulling his leg. You didn't get that, huh? I did! You're lucky that he didn't pull your leg! Potty... Don't take that lamp now. We can ask the watchman to bring it if required. Hello brother! Give me time for two more days. I've come to Vadakara to make an arrangement. No. I'll do it. Definitely! Sorry! Hello, Your Holiness! -I'll call you back! -Mr. Curd Rice! Ram! Long time! This is my wife, Prabha. -Hello. -Hey Prabha! How are you? Fine. -You look gorgeous. -Thank you. Don't I always tell you to wear the Sari properly? Didn't you see how he was looking? He's just named Ram. He's actually a Ravan. -What? -Well... It's quite a costly construction. -Costly! -Let that be! - Is this your car? -Yes. -Pathetic! -Why? How will you impress top-tier business clients, without a premium sedan, at least? You're still the same old miser, huh? What's that lamp on the back seat? We bought it for our house. There's a really nice shop in the market here. -If you like it, you can take it. -Get lost! I don't allow such cheap items even anywhere near this place. Come, I wanna show you something. Welcome... .. to the Accadio Saket! Thank you, dear! We are the number one luxury stay chain in the world. ACS, Bechtel, Vinci and Skanska... ... come only after us. - Is it? We focus on sea-side properties. We have 116 coastal home-stay properties currently. Superb! Across the world! -The sun never sets on the Accadio Saket! -Wonderful. Those who come here, walk along with history, breathe history, eat along with history, and sleep with history. Hey! Do you know the tariff here for one night? 3 Lakhs plus taxes. You won't understand all that, you Veggie! It's a million dollar game! Everything you see here... ... are historical relics. Very very costly, and specially curated for the Accadio Saket. Like our tagline suggests, the guests pay us to 'Stay among the relics'. Wow! -Beautiful. -Yes! -These are? -See! To understand style and substance, you need a classy eye. I like that! See this! This is from Chandragupta Maurya's period. We have twelve of them, on either side of the pathway. Saw that? It's from Krishnadevarayar's period. Come! There's much more to see! Wow! Hey! This! This is awesome! Broken Ganesha! Superb design! I love modern art! This is true art! Must be imported from America, right? Get lost. This is not modern art! Hey Pawan! -Pawan! -Yes, sir! Take this away! Put it in the basket and keep it on your head. I was going to throw it, sir. -What? -I was going to throw it. Then go and throw it, you ass! You come! Bloody Ganesh Visarjan! Now it's here too! Its hands, head, trunk, rat, Laddoos and what not, are lying all over my private beach. I asked him to throw it away and he has kept it here. *******! Come! -Ram, should I remove my shoes? -No, come. What is this? A museum? Hey! Here's our guest for the night. -Hello! -Hi! -Parameshwaran Potty, right? -Yes. Potty, this is Mythili. This is his wife, err... Prabha! Can you please take them around? -I'll take this call and come. -Sure. Hello! Please come. You can see the interiors. Mythili... this? The Greek Thinker. It's the only other replica of the thinker. This is from Accadio's original collection. Okay. Everything else was procured by us at Saket. These relics are Accadio Saket's USP. Our priceless relics gallery. Incidentally, this is the Accadio-Saket partnership's vanguard property. Oh, I see! Yeah, yeah! I'll meet them. -Come. -Yeah, sure. Now I'll show them around. You may please go and... ... get something to drink. -Come. -Hey Ram! This one? This is... This is Hitler, right? Yes. Made in wax! Who's this bald head? Benito Mussolini. These guys had killed a lot of people, right? Hey! It's a really bad omen... ... to place these guys at the entrance. -What do you even know? -Have you heard their speeches? -Yeah, right! "Bhaiyon aur Behanon" No one can beat that! Get lost! -I'm sorry. -Come. Mahatma Gandhiji. Hey! Aren't these Gandhiji's spectacles? Yes! I bought it during an action.... ... for 350,000 Dollars. -Oh! This is an ancient statue. An extremely rare piece of art. Wow! Che Guvera! What's this vanity bag doing here? It's a backpack he used when he was in Bolivia. I bought it when I got it for a good price. Just 250,000 Dollars. Wow! Safdar Hashmi. There's a lot to say about him. But this is the pen he used, while he was working in Economic Times. A very valuable piece! This is awesome! This is a great omen! You should be keeping this at your entrance! Lord Krishna! Bless me! You idiot! This is not Lord Krishna! This is NTR. NT Rama Rao. This is a famous character he played. He became the Chief Minister twice in Andhra, doing all this. You are too much! -So he was a Chief Minister too? -No! Panchayat President! Hey! Don't touch that! -Don't touch! -I won't. These are all antiques from Africa, that are worth several Lakhs. -If they fall.. - What's this? Hey! No! It's just an extension. -Come. -Keep a distance from him. The coin used by THE Amitabh Bachchan in the movie, Sholay. You've seen it only in the movie, right? In real! The dagger used by Jhansi Rani, to kill the British. This is it. This is my hero! Can you say who it is? Who is it? -Stalin! -Oh yeah! Karunanidhi's son! You... How do you run a company without a minimum general knowledge? And this is the legendary Dhyan Chand Singh's hockey stick. Wow! Cricket bat! Hey! This is the bat with which Kapil Dev scored 175 not out, against Zimbabwe in the Prudential Cup, 1983. Phew! You know at least that, huh? -Did you tell him anything? -No. See! We won't get a chance after this. I have to go back. -Please! -I don't know! I will tell him. But you have to... What game is this? What? This is a game played by the Americans, right? That? It's baseball, you idiot. Sundown, guests! -Let there be light! -It's sunset. I'll show you our night mode now. Wow! Peter Hofer. Special... double barrel gun? Ram... 224,000 Dollars? Really? This is an isolated place, right? I bought it for self-protection. It's part of my personal collection. Hey! It's fully loaded. Don't play with it. Idiot! You carry on. We're currently a partnership company incorporated in 2014, ...based in Trivandrum. -Yeah, fine. We have an annual turnover of 1 Crore in the last three years. Dude, do you remember... ...Uncle Basheer's Tipu Sultan gun? But it was smaller than this one, right? That reminds me! I forgot to show you someone. Come! One second. Cheers! Come. -Hello guests. -Oh my God! My name is Anastasia Aubert. and I am the founder, initiator of the Accadio homestay network. It's a hologram. One of the world's largest luxury.. Oh my God! This is the old white lady who came that day, right? What is this, man? The same hairstyle. The same frock. The same stance. Oh my God! Hey! You haven't changed at all, huh? You're still that old country bumpkin! -Goodbye. Au revoir. -Wait. Look at this. This is the Accadio Saket fun room. You can see many wonders like this here. Come, let's talk serious business now. So that's the plan. A profitable revamp of your software setup, with clientele predominantly in the U.S., Germany and U.K. -Yes. -Precisely, Ram. I'll tell you something frankly. My business has grown so much... ... because of my shrewdness. Of course, Mythili's money back-up too. Coming back to our point. What is your qualification to run this business? And I've done MBA too. You're referring to the degree from some cheap college in Nagercoil as MBA? There's no M, B or A there. So, forget that. Then... I've noticed it whenever I chat with you. Your English is abysmally poor. Have your drink. Brahmand Solutions. -Who named it? -Me. I knew it. You should change this disgusting name first. There's a way to do all this. Anyway, forget it now. I'll suggest a name. Bram Solutions! -But Brahma.. -Splendid! Wow! Thank you. By the way, who among you is planning to be the CEO? Me. What a successful CEO needs the most, is an impressive command over two European languages, other than English. And last but not the least, a rock solid personality! Don't get me wrong, Potty. You don't have any of this. If so, the most worthless person on this earth, would be Stephen Hawking. He's a scientist, damn it! Let's start with his name! Parameshwaran Potty. How do you spell it in English? P-O-T-T-Y. Just like I thought! Dude, 'Potty' has two meanings in English. One. The thing in which children take a shit. Two. An imbecile. I'm serious! Moreover, westerners never prefer... ... open ending names which end with sounds like 'E' and 'Oo'. Ramkumar, Mythili Ram. Short and pronounceable. What's your full name, Prabha? Prabha Nair. -Are you a Nair? -Yes. -Wow! -There are exceptions even among that. Narayana Swamy, Sundar Pichai, Ambani, Adani... These are all 'E's and 'Oo's, right? We're talking about the CEO of a software company now. A company which I am supposed to be investing in. If I don't have confidence, I won't invest. Be it a friend, colleague or even my father. That's what I'll do. Talking of your father reminds me... When your father got the documents of this property written in his name, from our old Uncle Basheer... He didn't think of continents or confidence like this. Not continents. Countenance! Well, I was just saying. Mythili, if I tell you about what happened back then, I can't imagine what will happen here. It will be a floccinaucinihilipilification. What? He has been listening to Shashi Tharoor's speeches all the time lately, to improve his English. Uncle Basheer? Does this place have such a history? You didn't tell me. Who's this Basheer? Well, this 'Sanket' of yours? -Saket! -Yes, whatever. -Long before this came into being. -Shucks! Those are all old stories! Forget all that, Potty. Please don't subvert the topic. I was saying that... I am ready to help you. But I'm not ready to forget my profit motive. I'm a businessman. That's all. Hey Mythili... Back in the day, he cleared his exams from 4th to 10th grade, copying my notes and answer sheets. -There's not doubt about that anyway! -See! It's not 'not doubt'. -'No doubt'! -Didn't I say so? No! If you have a doubt, ask Prabha. You said 'not doubt'. Have your drink. I will drink. I'll do one thing. I'll bring some snacks. You guys talk. I will invest... ... on one condition. Prabha should be the CEO. She's elegant, articulate, and good looking. What say? What is this? I'm asking you! Go hunting! But even that has some ethics. You need to have that. Is your childhood friend's wife your next target? We owe 2.5 Crores to the bank. Our house and office are facing a seizure notice. Ram is offering us 3 Crores without charging any interest. We don't have any other option. So, please don't create an unnecessary scene here. I know he is flirting with me. I know how to manage that. That's all you have left to do. Go ahead! Get drunk! When you went on a solo trip to Amsterdam, did I ask you who the playboy with you was? No. When you were at Norway countryside for two months with a Negro... Oh! Sorry! That's politically incorrect. You stayed with a 'man of colour' for two months. Did I ask you anything? No! So I will do whatever I want with my friend's wife, or with my aunt's daughter! Can you ask anything? No! So just shut your mouth up! These are the privileges of being affluent and rich! Please enjoy it... and let others also enjoy. Okay? I can't tolerate this. Do whatever you want! Err.. Toilet? Over there... in the fun room. Potty... I'm sorry. You bloody son of a gun, Potty! In the name of saving your business, you took Rs. 75 Lakhs from me and screwed me over! No capital, no interest either! Can't you just pimp your wife instead, you scumbag? Hey Potty! It's me, Abdu. I don't have any issue with you, dude! I know that your dad, the High Priest, had a part to play in this betrayal! But I can forgive that, since it was just a hapless Priest's desperation... ...resulting in unintended evil. My issue is with the other guy! That bloody son of a gun, Ram. I want to see him. But... not to give him a hug. You heard me? See you sometime! This is my number. You can save it, if you really want to! Mythili, where is Prabha? Upstairs, with Ram. Upstairs? -Come, sit. -No, it's okay. How do I go upstairs? End of the hall, at the left, you'll see the staircase. That way? -Yes. -Okay. Another one! Sex is also like money. Only too much is enough! And even when it's bad, it's good! Hey Potty! Come! Look! The night sea! It's a magnificent view from here. Enjoy the view. I'll make a call and come. Okay? You knew him already, right? What is this, Potty? He is a business development consultant. A leading venture capitalist, as well. We've been chatting for the past two years... ... on Instagram. Did you think he'll contact you out of the blue? Has Ram called you in the past 12 years? So... did he chat with me, because you told him to? Did he invite me because you asked him to? Yes! But I know where to draw the line. You don't worry. Dog! You didn't expect me to be here with Ram, right Prabha? No, nothing like that. Don't be apologetic. It's okay. I'm used to this, since maybe ten years. I'm over all that silly stuff. We are just business partners. This marriage is just a... ... working arrangement. This nuptial chain... is only for people. -Cut this, Pawan. -Okay, Madam. About our business... You know, we are in dire straits. I'm... desperate. Prabha... You don't have to explain to me. He is a complete womanizer. And... that's the only way to get to him. This thing called guilt... If you remove that from your mind, life becomes extremely smooth. After all, it's a man-made thing. Or is it woman-made? Do you need any help here? No, no. Just help yourself. Life in here... is a buffet. Here! So that's me... investing 3 Crores... ... to Brahmand. It will be renamed to 'Bram' Solutions. Okay. And here... is Prabha Nair, the C-E-O. And regarding the reporting system, I'll come to that later. Okay. First of all, you need a complete makeover. You have to look sexy and stylish, you know? -Oh! -Get rid of this Sari... and try western outfits. You have a lovely complexion. -You'd look superb. -Thank you. I'll take you out shopping. The first thing you should do... is to get a residence Visa in the UAE. I'll get that done... and you can stay with us. -Okay. -And... you should open a bank account at the Hinduja or Lombard over there. I'll be transferring the money from my Swiss bank account... to this new account of yours. Don't worry about anything. I'll take care of all the nitty-gritties. -Yeah? -Oh! Thank you! Good! Which one did you like among these? These two are nice. Forget this one. Ram has already booked this one. You can take this one. -How's this? -Arabic attire? -This is great. -Do you want it? -No, I don't want it. -Still... -Wear it once for me. -No, dude. -Wear it. -No, dude! You wear it! Shouldn't you be very careful while selling your property, Basheer? And it's a property that has been around since the time of the great Marakkar. Even if you want to buy a similar house and property at such a prime location, can you manage it now? Only God knows how the times are going to change, hereafter. Are you upset that this property is being sold.., ...or the fact that I am selling it to Hindus? Why are you feigning ignorance, Ikka? Are you not aware of what's happening around us? The problem is precisely that you're selling it to the Kafirs. I'll tell you something. I came along with the Musaliyar, after finding a buyer from our faith for your property. Two businessmen from Manjeri are ready. They will pay good money too. Money is not my only consideration, Rahman. What else is your consideration? Musaliyar... This Nair and Menon are like blood brothers to me. When they are asking me something out of sheer need, it would be unfair on my part to refuse them on grounds of religion.., ...and sell it to someone of our faith. I won't do that. That does not befit men of honour like us. You don't have to lecture us about honour. Don't you know that they have killed thousands of our brothers? Or... are you acting like you're unaware of it? We should preserve at least the land we own. Otherwise, they will turn us into outsiders in our own land, soon enough. Rahman! That's enough! Stop it. I'm not giving you a befitting reply, just because you're at my house. How old are you, boy? Tell me. I know this land and the people here, much more than you do. You don't have to teach me all that. Musaliyar, please explain all this to him, when you have the time. It is such hateful thinking that creates big problems. Only if the people help each other to grow and reform, will this land stay alive! Learn to love this country and obey the law of this land, first. Everything else will become alright on its own. No wonder you don't have a prayer bump on your forehead. Prayer bump, huh? There are Muslims here, who pray five times a day, and still don't have a prayer bump. It's just that you haven't seen such people. So don't tell me that. Musaliyar... you don't have to worry. I'm not selling the entire property. Just those four acres by the beach. The rest of the property and this house will still be with me. Now, don't be upset. Drink the juice, lad! Mom, look at Potty! How does he look? Abdu, don't make him play the fool. Take it off! Why? He looks really good! "Sheikh Potty Bin Melshanthi"! Sahib... The High Priest is here. -Is it time to take him back home? -Yes. Abdu! Potty's father is here to take him back. Bring him here. Come on, Sheikh Potty. Hey! Hey! Behave yourself! Why are you standing there, Potty? Have a seat. Dad, look at him! Sheikh Potty. What the hell are you doing, Abdu? Don't you dare play mischief with anything and anyone. Go inside and take it off, son. Go. Please don't mind it, Priest. You know my son, right? Please don't bother. They are children, it's natural. I don't send you here so that you can dress up like a fool and humiliate me! That boy can't write notes by himself or what? Should you go over and help him everyday? They are uncivilized people. Don't forget that. Show me your hand. Don't eat whatever they give you. What is this? This is a dress that Abdu gave me. Come on, walk! Ass! Come on! Potty! You just want to stand here? Come! I'll show you a great state-of-the-art home theatre. Come on! Come, dude! Prabha! Hey! Look! It's an 8K projection. You can watch movies, TV channels... Moreover, you can even watch porn in a theatre effect. Come, I'll show you. Sit down, man! What do you want to watch? Horror? Comedy? Action? Or....? Let's start. Hey Potty! Your favourite actor is still Rajinikanth, right? Come on. Annamalai is not available. I can't find Baasha. 'Muthu'. Is 'Muthu' okay? Yes, 'Muthu' is fine. Play it. -Go forward. -Huh? Fast forward! Some more. Some more. Yes, stop here. Play it. Pause! Pause, pause! Raghuvaran usurped the father Rajinikanth's properties, using forged documents. The son Rajinikanth was a child then. But Raghuvaran is up for a shock. The father Rajinikanth will forgive Raghuvaran. Out of that depression, Raghuvaran will commit suicide. A similar story has happened right here, in this property too. But the one who committed suicide, was not the betrayer. It was the betrayed. That Abdullah? Where is he now? Who knows! He fled from this town long ago, right? What about his sisters? I saw it on a school WhatsApp group which I was part of, earlier. That the two of them are somewhere in Syria, apparently. But only God knows who they are with, and what condition they are in. That country is going through a revolt and war, right? Well, you should be knowing about all this first. You can see news channels also on this. Where's Mythili? Let me go downstairs. You're spoiling it. Idiot! There are several reports about the increasing crime rates in this city, sir. Is it because of the indifference of the police? What do you have to say about this? Ever since I took charge here, law and order issues have dropped considerably. I can show you the statistics. Isn't this our Kalyanam? Hey! Don't call him that. Kalyan! That's his name. Wait. I was going to give you a surprise. He is the proxy fund manager of Accadio Saket in Kerala. Women's safety, child safety... Police have undertaken large scale surveillance measures in these fronts. He's a silent partner of all this too. -He's a DIG in the police. -I've heard that. And the surprise is that... ...he is coming here. In some time. It's good to have a police connection in your business too. You talk to him. You can stay here and leave tomorrow. After dinner, I need to have some deep discussions with Prabha. Even if I go back to Southampton, Prabha will have to come there. I'll be signing the papers over there. Hey Potty! There's no such thing as a free lunch. You got me, right? -What? -Sir, a man is here. Who? Who are you? Sir wants to know. Sir, he's saying that he's your friend. Hey! Kalyan Menon is here. Send him in. Okay. You may go inside. Hey Kalyan! Where is my friend? He went to the backside, sir. Backside? Why? How do I know, sir? Come, let's go and check. Kalyan! Who is this? Who is this? Father! Yes! What is it, son? Are you fine, father? Of course! We lost everything! And yet you are fine? That's right, father. Heard what my father said? "So what if we lost the house, son... They have built us a Jannat-Ul-Firdaus here!" Abdullah Marakkar. How did he reach here? The house that Ram built... ... is just like you building a house for me. Abdu... We lost everything, son. Everything! We lost your father too! Abdu... Mother! Aishu had called me over the phone. She told me that... she will be going to the city, with her husband. We need to find where they are. We need to find who took her. Promise me, son. Promise your mother. The promise of a madman... What value does it have, mother? Mother! Two women among the 174 people who died in the bomb attack at Syria... I heard that they were Beevuamma's daughters. We didn't tell her that because she was ailing. Aisha! Rehana! Aisha! Rehana! Brother... Save us from here, brother! Save us, brother! Brother... Brother! Here stood almost 500 years ago, an original structure built by successors... ... of the great Naval captain of Kerala, Kunjali, the Third, also known as Kunjali Marakkar. Hey Potty! Your Holiness, do you want to bowl? Go and be the Umpire, you ass! I will bowl...! Pace! Pace! Malcolm Marshall..!! You are finished, Abdullah! When you destroy something, you should destroy it completely. -Ramakumara! -Abdu, no! -Hey! Louder! You should scream a little louder! No one will hear it even then. Though he's rich and famous now, Abdu, please. there's no sign of a human here to respond to a scream here. So, if this Abdu decides to take revenge for everything that happened in the past, there's no one here to say it to the outside world. Right? Will you say it? Abdu, no! Let go of him. Abdu, please. The way you've caught me now... Is it for me to kill him... or not to kill him? -To kill him. I mean, not to kill him. Abdu, please. Got scared? "Your Holiness!" I was kidding! It's just a show. But you....!! You should be scared. Because this is Abdu's night. Do you have a doubt? Look! Sir! Don't look at the moon today. It's the Ganesh Chathurthi festival today. You will be cursed. Who are you, you little devil? Bhede. Pawanputra Bhede. Pawanputra Bhede? Come on! Let's talk! I've kept everything ready, Madam. This is Pulao, this is Paratha... This is Aloo Gobi and this is Matar Paneer. -Okay. -Call me if there's anything. Is it okay if I stay over tonight with my uncle and friends, and come back tomorrow afternoon, Madam? Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram! Mythili... Why is he dressed like this? He's a member of Kothadia's party. Let him go. That's better. Sir, I'm talking about the rules. I gave them permission because... ...they had promised that not one person more than thousand people... ...will be there at the grounds to listen to his speech. But sir, I had already informed you, right? Sir, more than 400 of his supporters from different states... ...have been staying in different hotels here for the past one week. How many people are attending this meeting? Already 2000 plus, sir. There's full media coverage too. Almost all the COVID protocols have been flouted, sir. In that case, you should have taken a call. You're the Commissioner of this city, right? Who is in charge there now? 2 ACP's, 4 CI's.... and almost more than a hundred constables are there at the spot, sir. In that case, we have to think of something more effective. Revel among relics, live in history. This is good. It's good to have the company of at least one thief who's bigger than you. Oh! Wow! -Did you call? -Yes. The cops will come now. Saddam Hussein's favourite brand of wine. Woah! I must try this drink, Ram! Yuck! Stale black tea! So everything here is fake, right? Deception during betrayal..! Catch it! Oh no! You're impressive, Ram! You've kept your old cunningness intact. Bloody shit! Accadio Sanctum. Accadio believes in preserving origins. Hey! It's just an extension. Let's go there and talk peacefully. "Awake! For morning in the bowl of night... ...has flung the stone that puts the stars to flight." Abdu, no! "And lo, the hunter of the east has caught..." , After destroying history, under the false pretence of preserving history, after taking a foundation brick from the remains of that destroyed history, after placing that stone in a prayer room covered in green, and after posting a pseudo historic caption below it, you invite the students of history from lands afar, ...hoodwink them, rob them of their precious money... ...to lead this luxurious life of yours! Hats off.... Ram! When I see all this, as a bosom friend of yours, I can ideally react... in two ways: Either, be proud of the fact that you are still nurturing your old ancestral skill of living off betraying others, be proud that it still has been a profitable proposition for you, and be proud that you have become a great success in life. I can gatecrash here, celebrate your success with a drink or two, be happy for you and go back to my world. Or I can be shocked and jealous seeing all this glitter, drink your booze, enjoy your hospitality, and puke it out before I go back to my world. But this beautiful night.... ...is expecting neither from me. For, the real owner of all that you see here... ...happens to be me! In your father's betrayal, in this empire that you've built, in this property where we're sitting now, had fallen the tears of my family, my mother and my sisters, and you know that. You also know that this has been built upon my father's blood. If someone is well aware of the crime he has committed, and still continues to live his life, enjoying all the privileges that came with it, without feeling even an iota of remorse, then a Judgement becomes inevitable, because justice has to be served. A verdict! That one double-edged word, which resides within both 'justice'... ...and 'revenge'. 'Theerppu'. Till now, I had wished only to give a tight slap across your face, if I ever ran into you. But... not anymore. Your husband's history of betrayal... ... has just begun unravelling. The three of you are the jury here. I am Abdullah Marakkar... The Supreme Judge, here. What's your name? Mythili. Wow! Everything is perfect! Go ahead! Narrate the rest of the story yourself. The Advocate read the agreement aloud for my father. What was it? That we'll take only the beachfront and the adjacent 4 acres, and that we won't touch the rest. This story of this treachery by your king and his daddy, can't be confined to a single movie, my dear. It's as vast as, say, a "Game of Thrones". Tell us the next scene, Ram. Say it, man! Mr. Menon... Mr. Nair... We need that ancient house along with the beachfront property. Not just the beachfront property. They're asking for the house too. She'll cancel the deal if she doesn't get the entire property. Else, we just drop this deal altogether. Or else, she'll drop this deal. -What? -Just come with me. Just a minute. I'll be right back. Please wait. Hey! Look! What is it? Look at her hair, dude. It's really nice, right? What? Is this really necessary? When the tile company ran into losses and I was in debt of millions, I had begged your landlord dad to help me out. He didn't give me a single penny. So, you better shut up! Menon, please come. What is it, Nair? Now stop gawking and study! -What is it? -Come with me. What should we tell her now? If we agree to this, it should profit us too, right? That, she will ensure. -She must! -How? A foreign company cannot come to India... ... and start something on its own, as of now. They have to buy land in the name of an Indian citizen first, and then, he has to lease it to the company. Or else, we must make these foreigners our overseas partners, for the trade that we're conducting here. It will work out, right? There won't be any problem, right? If you ask me so... what we're going to do, is completely problematic! So, first you decide... whether we have to do it or not. Let me know after that. I didn't mean that. I... err... You go ahead. I'm listening. Are you sure? I am sure. Then I'll tell you one more fact. If people without a conscience, start acting as if they have a conscience, it will not only be difficult for them, but also for the others who are trying to help them out. So... stop this 'acting', first. This is your only opportunity. We're giving Lakhs to Basheerkka, right? And not for free, right? I'll make the necessary corrections... ...in the agreement that we read out to him. Leave that to me. Get the property registered in your name first. You don't have to be so guilty about it. What about you then? Your share? After we sign the deal with them, I'll draft another agreement, which will be between the two of us. Since the moral risk in this case is totally yours, from the profit we make from this deal, 80% will be yours. 20% will be mine. We need to ask one more thing. After your death, your son needs to have a hold over the company and the profit. Also, the profit sharing between Ram and Kalyan, shall continue to be on the same terms. Okay? We are ready. But there are certain conditions. Okay! Book Cricket Ramkumar - 4, Abdullah - 2 Sahib, the agreeement was read out to you, right? -Yes. -You want to read it once again? No. The advocate had read it out to me. You can sign here. I don't know how to sign. Do you have a stamp pad? Get him the stamp pad. -Where? -Over here. Yes! Six! Come on, continue. Your turn. Hey Nair! Don't tell him that I'm here. Are you studying? -No. We're playing the game of dots. -Carry on! Nair! Hey Nair! Sahib.... That white lady's people are asking me to vacate my house. Did you add our home too to the sale deed? Sahib, let us sit inside and talk. Just give me a yes or no. Did you add my home too, when you wrote the sale deed? Oh no, Sahib! I didn't write the agreements, right? It was the foreign company people, right? Didn't I ask you to sign it only after hearing what's written in the agreement? Since you can't read, Advocate Menon had read it out for you, right? He is inside, right? Yes. Didn't I read out everything? It was an agreement to sell the whole property. In the agreement you read out to me, it was specifically stated that they will take only the beachfront area, and won't touch my house and surroundings. Wasn't it so? No. That's not what we said or read out. Even if that was the case, you stand to lose nothing. You're getting eight lakhs for the whole property including the house. Isn't that a huge amount? You can repay all your debts, well, to an extent, with that. If not anything else, you can at least meet your own medical expenses properly, right? Longevity is more important than anything else, right? I haven't come to talk about the money, Nair. The two of you made me sell off my house as well, huh? That house has played host even to the Prophet's disciples. Do you know that? Leave alone quoting a price for it, I can't even imagine selling it. Not just me. No one can do that. Even if you think about doing that, God will not forgive you. Let go of him, Basheerkka. There's no point in manhandling us after signing the documents. Without spite or hatred in one's mind, if one forgives the sinners, it is supposed to be equal to offering a thousand prayers. But... for what you have done here now, sooner or later, you will have to face retribution. A 'Theerppu'! But it won't be from me. It will be from Allah! What's your problem now? Whatever I am doing is legal. Legal? Sooner or later, you, me and our son Ram, will have to suffer for this. Wait and watch! He cursed you from the bottom of his heart. At least go, fall at his feet and seek his forgiveness! Children shouldn't be around when elders are talking. Go inside, son. Priest.., This country existed for so long... ... only because of a mutual understanding. Right? When my Uncle from the Arabia said that I should be sent to a school, my father told my uncle, "He has this field" "This farm" "We just have to save money" "This country is a good place" "This country and its people... ... will never create any trouble" "We can hire people to read and write for us" "You just have to be able to afford it" It was my father's last word. An old Hajiyar's verdict. You can call it arrogance too. My father trusted this country so much! Though the tears of my entire family has fallen on this land today, I understood a fact. That you people are not my friends... ... and you can never be, either. Never! I've always considered you like my own brother, Nair. And yet, you did this to us? Where will we go with these three children? Beewathu... You go inside. Women don't have to come out and assert. Got it? How many days do I have left, to vacate? They have to start work within two days. But you can take a week, Ikka. To pack all this, you'll need... I'll handle all that. You both may leave now. I will shift from here. I will shift within two days. Well... Aren't you taking your children along? Forgot that too? Aren't you doing all this for their sake? Abdu! Send your friends out. Abdu, my book? Sahib... One share of the profit we make from this business, will be yours.... Allah! Do I have to hear that too, Nair? My footwear... I was furious at my father, that day. "What you did was a grave sin, Dad" "It's an unforgivable sin"... I said all that. That's Malcolm Marshall bowling and the ball hits the bat and he's gone! He's gone! This will put an end to Abdu's bragging! Come here! My dad slapped me on my face that day. That pain still remains on this cheek. Sorry to say this, sir. Sir is not at all co-operative. What do you mean? Please, please. Now don't make this an ego tussle between you two. I do this all the time, right? Move away. What's this new habit? What's with this new habit? What are you doing? Have it, all of you. How's your father's Biriyani? It's delicious, father! Eat until your tummy is full, dear. After paying off the debts, I have deposited the remaining Rs. 2 Lakhs in the bank, in your name. Here are the documents. In the bank? In my name? Yes! And... I sold our car. For scrap price. What's the point in keeping it now? Why are you saying all this now? You will be with us, no? All of us... ... can shift to my sister's house in Manjeri. Though it's not as spacious, it's a good house. She will have some company too. Eat, dear. Have your food, Abdu. They know what happened to my father. Father! You left us, huh? You left us? Father! Coward! Coward! You left us? You left us behind? Father! Father! Father! It's okay even if we lose the land, Musaliyar. We should at least stop them from demolishing the house. For my husband! He loved it more than anything. Nothing is possible now, Beewathu. There will be a huge ruckus. They will riot all over town. Nothing is possible now. You may go. Wait. There is one way. When are they going to demolish it? Immediately. Achu's son Chandrabhanu is working at the archaeological department in the town. Let's go and meet him. We can find out if there are some Government rules that may help us. Why do you have to take so much effort, Musaliyar? We too have boys with us! Let them start a riot. We'll reply in the same coin. Shut up, boy! Riots and fights may not always be won by the side of truth. Even if a truthful minority fights with the majority, it's the majority that ends up winning, most of the time. You know that? So shut up and go home! Get lost! Oh my God! This is 400 years old. If only a quarter of it has been demolished so far, we can stop the demolition, and find ways to make the Government preserve the house, at least. You delayed it so far, despite having this with you? You keep preventing your children from going to schools and studying English, and keep sending them to your Madrasas. And finally your documents and properties will be usurped by people who can read and write. Someone come with me. No. Just one of you. Abdu... Go with him, son. Come, come! -Son.. -Yes, mother. You shouldn't get anxious. Your mother has no one else. Hey! That Archaeology officer is coming. Detonate it. Quickly! Make it fast! Hey! Stop it! Don't demolish it. This is illegal. -Demolish it! -Quick! Do it quickly! No! Stop it. -Don't demolish it. -What are you doing, Abdu? Someone stop him. Don't go there. -Stop it. -Abdu! Stop him! Abdu, stop. Abdu! Abdu! Son... Abdu! Hey Abdu! What does... ... the Jury say? What punishment will bring justice? From this silence, I should understand that... the majority does not approve of any kind of punishment. Forget it. Does the Jury at least acknowledge the fact that a crime was committed here? Then... against the majority, and with conscience as the only witness, Abdullah Marakkar, the Supreme Judge must proclaim the judgement. The final judgement. An ancient house which had a history of centuries. A house which was demolished through treachery. For orchestrating that demolition, and for conspiring towards it, for being the beneficiary of that betrayal, for gaining social and financial stature through it, for causing a death due to that betrayal, and for being responsible for a family that was lost in the streets, V. Ramkumar Nair, son of Vikraman Nair has been sentenced by this Court, this Court of God, ...to death! Hey Abdu! What is this? Sit down! You should see certain things before you are killed. You should also experience... ...the trauma of losing everything that you hold dear in life. The shock of seeing things getting destroyed right in front of your eyes. But... ... your mother? She died ten years back. She suffered a lot. She had tuberculosis. Ah! Good people are always like that. They die only after suffering a lot. She liked you a lot. She always used to talk about you. But my dear Ram, dead people are not going to know... ... who died and who killed whom. But you don't have to be scared. Since you're not a good man, you will never suffer before you die. Everything will be quick. Well... Should we not toss a coin before the match begins, Potty? How can we forget old habits so easily? Yes! Hey! Don't move! -Call the police! -They will come now. Where is Kalyan? He's not answering. Amitabh Bachchan's dialogue from "Sholay" Wow! I've found the perfect item! âª We shall never break this friendship of ours âª Song from 'Sholay' I'll give you one chance. Heads or tails? -Heads! -Wait! If it's heads, I will kill you. If it's tails, I won't. Hey Ram! Even your relics are saying that I should kill you. Heads! Death by relics. The cricket bat used by Kapil Dev when he scored 175... Wow! Is this for real? No one could watch that innings back then. BBC was on strike. But today, the highlights of that thunderous innings, you can watch it live. Wow! Abdu... -Potty, stop him. -Stop it! Well... I need a ball to play cricket. Ball? Yes! The foundation stone of my palace which was demolished. Let it be our cricket ball for tonight. Hey Potty! You do the bowling. Do you remember? These guys never gave you bowling or batting back then. You were always the umpire. Potty Bird! Today you will bowl... I will bat, and he will be the umpire. This... ... will be our stumps. Throw it. Throw it! We'll know now, if this is Kapil Dev's original bat, or fake like Saddam Hussein's wine. Okay. First ball. Shot! This is original, indeed! He should have been here too. Kalyan Menon! -Where is he? -He is in the Police. He's a DIG. -He will come now. -It's alright. He's a cop, right? He'll come only after the villain dies. He's also a partner in this company. It's not like messing with me. Hey Ram! If your father was the Dhritharashtra in this story, Advocate Menon was the Shakuni. If you are Duryodhan, he is Dusshasan. So first, I'll break your thigh! After that, I will tear open his chest! Hey Potty! Announce the score. Six! Hail Lakshman Sena! Hail Kothadiyaji! Hail Chandran Pillaji! Hail Lakshman Sena! Hail Kothadiyaji! Hail Chandran Pillaji! Hail Lakshman Sena! My dear people, The fireworks are about to begin. For your kind attention, no one should go towards that area. Before the fireworks begin, All India Lakshman Sena's constant companion, and the famous DJ Arun Singh Keshav will be presenting a brand new song. A brand new song in praise of Lakshman Sena... ...will be performed on this stage. Hail Lakshman Kothadiyaji..!! Hail Chandran Pillaji..!! Hail Lakshman Kothadiyaji..!! Hail, the Lion of the South, Chandran Pillaji..!! Hail Lakshman Sena! Hail! Hail! Hail!

My name is Anastasia Ober. -And I am the founder, initiator.. -Go and check on him. No. Ram will handle it. May you revel amongst relics. Isn't this our old white lady? So enjoy your stay... ... in the Accadio fun room. You caught hold of her too? Mythili! Mythili! -Switch on the lights, Mythili! -You schmuck! Mythili! Yes, it's back! Come on! Come! That's a great shot, Marakkar! Marakkar, damn it! Hey Ram! Nunchaku and Karate are not meant for you! The 'Mohiniyattam' dance suits you best! You idiot! Be careful. You will hurt yourself with it. I just told you, right? Abdu, let him go! Enough! Ram, no! Let go of me! Ram, that's enough. Abdu! Ram, stop it! Abdu, let him go! You.... You will shoot Gandhiji? Will you? Potty, stop them! Hey Potty! Come and hold the gun! Abdu, let him go! Abdu! Abdu! Abdullah, let go of him! Please stop! Ram! Ram! -Move away, Mythili Devi. -Ram, no! Ram! Don't hit him, Ram! Ram, stop! You bloody dog! If we snatched away your father's property, that's because of his incapability. If he shot himself dead, that's his foolishness! I am both the Judge and the Jury here! Enough, Ram! Ram! This is the verdict. The finale! The real Death Penalty. Death... for me. Penalty... for you. Ram! Ram, check if he's still alive. He's dead. Abdu! Abdu! Abdu! Abdu! You killed him? He... He was going to... Ram... It's Kalyan. Talk to him. -Kalyan... -Bro, what do I say! That braggart DGP made a lightning visit to the Commissioner's office. A new Commissioner has taken charge. A new posting. A hot-headed a*****e. And on top of all this, there's a mess of a meeting as well. I got free only now. I'll go home, change my clothes and come there quickly. Okay? Hey! The resort must be stunning after your renovation, right? I need to see it fully once I get there. I'll be there soon. And one more thing. Though you offered us 20% of the profit, my father and myself have only received Rs. 1.5 Million from you till date, ever since the deal was closed. So when I come there tonight, give me Rs. 20 Million in cash first, and settle all the old accounts. You can show your hospitality after that. Got it? Kalyan sir. He is their stooge here. He's putting on this dumb act, though he's aware of everything. I know, I know. Sir, when this Covid situation is prevailing, we should not be allowing... ...a meeting of this scale, under any circumstance. -We can't even insist them to wear masks. -You tell me then. What should I do? Should I do a Lathi charge? If I upset them, they will brand me an anti-National. If I upset them, they will brand me a Sanghi or a Muslim extremist. The police department lost its honour and power long back! Even if we want to take action, there will be a Lathi charge against us on social media tomorrow. After a glaring gap of five years, have they both come to reinstate their Kerala business empire! The Accadio South East Asia power couple, Ramkumar and Mythili. Please accept this hearty welcome from your humble partner and Kerala Police. Please accept this bouquet. That crappy car lying outside? Whose is it? Brahmand Solutions? What happened? Any sentimental attachment? Something has happened. Something terrible has happened. Do you know how he got here? Did he have a vehicle? I'm asking you. No... but we had met him in the city. And? And he enquired about Ram to us. But we avoided him without giving him an answer. Where all are the CCTV cameras installed here? I need its footage. If you have that, we can call this an intrusion and claim that the murder was in self-defense. Where is the server? It hasn't been installed. Great! World's greatest luxury chain! Great! Did he have a phone? Ram, it might be in the fun room. Mythili, go and check there. Prabha, you go there. Go! Mythili, over there. Found it! Found his phone! Here! Mythili, he found the phone. Come. -Here you go. -Hey Potty! You're quite impressive. Covering it in a handkerchief? Well, I have seen it in movies. Nice! Hey Ram! I found this under the sofa. Keep this safe. Okay. Ram! Search his pockets. What's that paper? It's the bill from a bar. Potty.... What's that? Nexito. Anti-depressant. Give it to Potty. Check his back-pockets. Give it to Potty. Pack all of it together, and keep it there. Mythili! Get me the bouquet I brought. Ram! Take out a flower from the bouquet. Come on, do it. You have killed him anyway. Before taking the next step, confess all the sins... ...that you and your father committed towards Abdu and his family, and place that rose flower on his chest. What about your father? That's not relevant now. This was really too much! Though it's you who killed him, it is he who has really won. How? I'll tell you later. Place that flower there, first. Keep it. The Abdullah Marakkar that I know... ... might be capable of all this rampage. But what you did to him now... he wouldn't have ever done the same to you. I'm sure about that. Hey Kalyan! Save me! Help me! Help us! I will. I'll manage this. But I will have to engage the entire state machinery under me, for this. And it will be really... really, really expensive. First, some hard cash. And later on, the expenditure to maintain the status quo of this crime in the future. I'll tell you very frankly. This... ... is going to be a lifelong regular entry in your balance-sheet. Now, did you understand how he won? When you kill the powerless, they win the war with their very own death. Can you please spare the rhetoric? How much will it cost? Tell me that. 8 Crores. 8 Crores? What the...!! Are you blackmailing me? How dare you, you snake? You forgot one thing. You're also a partner in this. For everything that happened in this property, you are also responsible. This is a property registered in the name of Vikraman Nair, and his heir Ramkumar Nair. As per the deal with Accadio Saket, Advocate Krishna Menon and his son Kalyan Menon, will have a share in the profits from this business. Anything that happens within the privacy of this property, be it debauchery or murder, its complete responsibility... will solely be upon Accadio's South-East Asia head Ramkumar, and quality control head Mythili Ramkumar. Moreover, you just grabbed the collar of... .. a Police DIG with high political affluence. So if you want to see yourself out of this... the initial sum will be, 8 Crores! Ram! You have half an hour to take a decision. Do you want to go to jail... .. or do you want all this back? Come with me. Just a second. Bro... Though I keep bluffing unnecessarily... to make my business flourish, the truth is that... ... my financial situation is not so great, unlike what you think. Did you see all these broken relics? All are duplicate items. It's just for show-off. Oh! Why didn't you tell this to me all this while? Well, I'm also supposed to be a silent partner in all this, right? Kalyan! Only this 8 acres, and this building which is mine, as well as yours. I only have this 'Saket' property with me. -What I make from.. -Hey! Hey! Stop it! What did you call me earlier? A snake, right? Indeed, I am a venomous snake. But... there's that proverbial snake, that bites the one struck by lightning. I'm not that type. Got it? Okay. Since you have requested so much, I can reduce half a Crore. So, it's 7.5 Crores. No more bargaining. This is final. And you don't have to give me anything hereafter, in the name of this silent partnership. Okay? Aren't you happy, bro? This is all I can do! Hey! In this situation, if I have to raise even a penny more than three Crores, I need to beg the loan shark Marwadi. I'll be ruined paying those extremely high interests. Please! So, the 116 resorts around the world which you used to talk about, so far? It was all bluff, brother! Total bluff! Ram! One minute. Go! Go ahead! Bloody opportunistic dog! What will we do? Let's just agree to his conditions. We don't have a choice. I'm sorry. Let's go deal with him. Childhood friend! What's all this, dude? It's his handiwork. We are ready. Don't misunderstand me, Mythili. I won't take even a single Rupee from what you're giving me. That is to destroy all the evidence in this case, and to maintain the status quo for ages. To the last shilling of it. -Are you okay? -Yes. Ram, just a minute. -I have to tell you something. -What? Potty! In between this? It's really urgent. That's why. -5 minutes. Come back quickly. -That's fine. Ram, come! Prabha, you also come. Mythili... There was a servant here, right? Yes. There's a watchman. He has gone to listen to that Kothadiya's speech. He'll come back only in the afternoon. Is he from this area? No. He came from Thane. Oh, yes. Praveen Kumar or Singh? Pawanputra Bhede. Yeah! Bhede! Do you have his documents with you? I have copies of his passport and Aadhaar card. Good. Bring it. Okay. Mythili! You said he fired the gun twice, right? Where all did the bullets strike? I have to recover the bullet cases. One hit the box with Gandhiji's spectacles. Another one hit the box which had Safdar Hashmi's pen in it. Both bullets have struck at politically incorrect places. What is it? Huh? Where are you going? Stay there. You stand here. You ******! You and her were fooling around on WhatsApp and Insta for the past two years, huh? You scoundrel! Once, when Sudama came to his friend Lord Krishna asking for help, the Lord did greatly help his friend. But in return, He didn't ask for Sudama's wife! Even though you are named Ram, you are still that old Nair's son, right? Ramkumar Nair! Leave that. If Kalyan has promised to solve this, he will do it. I'm sure about that. He is that Advocate's son, right? But... if this Sudama intends to, he can turn this game on its head, right away. Hey! You have only one way. Like him, make me also... ... a Kubera! What do you mean? 5 Crores! 5 Crores? Dude! Even Amitabh Bachchan gives away 5 Crores to 3rd runners up in KBC. So don't tell me that. It's not such a huge sum in today's age. Brahmand Solutions! All debts cleared! CEO, Parameshwaran Potty. P-O-T-T-Y. And... I got a call earlier, right? I had told him then, that I had come to meet Ramkumar at Vadakara. So, don't think that you can get rid of me. Got it? 5 Crores! Bank transfer. I have nothing to lose. Go. Go downstairs. Hey Ram! Free lunch, huh? Bloody dog! Go! So, it was you who called Abdu here? This condition is called, floccinaucinihilipilification. Shashi... Tharoor! Is the speed-boat lying outside yours? -Yes, it's mine. -We'll need it. Prabha... Get me the overcoats and hats of Hitler and Mussolini. Mythili, this place should be clean when we come back. Not a speck of this mess should remain. Potty, watch whether someone is coming from outside. -Lock the gate from inside. -Okay. Ram! Take this dagger, and that piece of stone. Bring them both. What for? Just do as I say! The beach has good visibility even at night. Even the sea is not 100% safe. The beam from the lighthouse is an issue. Get up. Take that dagger. Jhansi Rani's dagger. I won't touch the body. Just do as I say. Got me? What? I get dizzy when I see blood. I'll faint. Deja vu moment. Nair, if people without a conscience, start acting like they have conscience, it will not only be difficult for them, but also for the others who are trying to help them out. So, stop this acting first. Come here. Come on! Sit down. Sit down. What are you waiting for? Cut him open. Come on! From the side... Do it properly! Cut through the sides. Open him up properly. Open it. Put that stone inside his stomach. Keep it inside. Now tie it up with the cloth. Tighten it on that side. Get up. Throw the body into the water. Go ahead. Come on! Now we have to leave this Hitler & Mussolini in the sea. Don't leave any trace. Why are you crying like this, you loser? You've joined the club of celebrated murderers now. Be proud! That's your only option. There won't be any problem, right? Will he come back? Usually the body comes back on the third day, right? Nothing like that. Marakkar is supposed to be the Lion of Arabian Sea, right? The lions of the sea, will be taken by the sea herself. Come. So, as I said... When will you leave? We'll leave immediately. Ram, come. When are you leaving? Day after. My tickets are booked for that day. Don't skip that. Before you reach the airport, that transfer I asked for, should happen. To the UAE Hinduja bank account of my wife, you will deposit money from your Swiss Bank account. Then, it will be transferred to my wife's NRI account in some godforsaken bank here, from where I'll withdraw it. Just a trick from your own book. And... don't try to act smart with me. An extradition from the UK, is not so difficult anymore. Come here, all of you. Now, relax. Don't worry. If I say that I'll manage it, I'll do it. You know, right? Shall I leave? Hail Lord Ram! What happened on your face, sir? It's nothing. It was a superb speech by Lakshman Kothadiyaji, Madam. Why are you back so early? Didn't you say that you'll come only by afternoon? Didn't you go to your uncle's house? I went there, Madam. I had a blast with my friends. I got drunk last night. I had a lot of fun. So much fun at night. There was a party happening here last night, right sir? Okay. Go and clean the garden. One more thing, sir. While I was sleeping on the beach last night, I saw two people going to the sea on our boat. Since I was really drunk, I fell asleep over there. I thought I'll go and check in the morning. Then? But... in the morning... I woke up in the morning, hearing a ruckus. When I looked, some people and the police had crowded on the beach. When I went forward to get a closer look, I saw someone's chopped off hand. -Sir, someone is here to see you. -Who? Who are you? Sir wants to know. Tell him that I'm his friend. He knows me. Sir, he's saying that he's your friend. -Send him in. -Okay. You may go in. Has anyone here seen this tattooed hand earlier? -Have you? -But I didn't tell them anything, sir. At night, our boat was on that side. But when I checked now in the morning, it's on this side. When I checked inside the boat to find where it went at night, I found this, sir. There's something written in Malayalam in this. The moon was shattered, And moonlight, erased... Didn't someone come to meet you last night, sir? Who is he? I know everything! But I won't tell anyone anything, sir. He was a Turk, right? Bloody Pakistani! He deserved to die! But I have a small request. My mother is not well at all. She is bedridden. I haven't been able to go to my hometown for two years. For her treatment, I need some money. Very little. For the hospital expenses. How much? 50,000. 50,000 Rupees. We will give it. Every month. Every month, 50,000 Rupees! In cash. When you kill the powerless, they win the war with their very own death. Hail Lord Ram! 'THEERPPU' The Settlement Hello? Cantonment police station! Hello? I had called earlier. What's the matter? A man-missing case, in Vadakara. I've already registered a complaint. I wanted to know about that. Madam, say the name. I am Dr. Shwetha. Dr. Shwetha... Not that! Say the name of the missing person! Abdullah. Abdullah Marakkar. âª Where History once slept and rose in peace.., âª âª Recent wrongs have castled up. âª âª Old wounds fester here, now, âª âª By the salty waves of the sea of sin..; âª âª On this night.., âª âª Thisâ¦ very night! âª âª If happenstanceâ¦ joins hands with destiny.., here, âª âª Itâs Apocalypseâ¦! âª âª That blood-stained finale, âª âª itâd be unimaginable! âª âª Suchâ¦ is the swelling surge of the past.., âª âª The battle song of Karma! âª âª The end of story? âª âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª Hail Lord Ganesha! A ritual once confined only to Maharashtra and Bengal; ...now they've brought it here too. Total crap! The colour of our English channel... ...and the colour of this goddamn sea here. Terrible! Drainage, waste, trash and what not! Shucks! And if they murder someone, those corpses too..! Even 'God' gets dumped in this sea now. It's a real tragedy, you know! The eco-system is totally gone! -Hey Pawan! -Yes, sir! Clear everything. Not one speck of trash should remain there. He's calling it trash, bloody dog!! Did you hear me? Forgive me, Lord Ganesha! I heard you! "I heard you, sir!" "Heard you, sir!" A sea that brings everything from there over here. Who's coming for dinner? Who's coming for dinner? Oh! Parameshwaran Potty. My old school friend. You postponed our return trip by three days, saying that you have a most important business meeting, for this silly get-together? That too, during this Covid pandemic? It's not a silly get-together, Mythili..!! It's a serious business meeting! He's struggling now with plenty of debts and losses. I have to help him out. We shouldn't forget our roots... and our old friends too. That's not an essential Ramkumar line. "Help", "Our roots"... Without some kind of prize money or trophy, you don't take so much effort usually. My husband, Mr. Ramkumar Nair. Now, listen... Just play the host well, and do your damn business. Got it? There must be someone else with him. Huh? Who is it? Sir! What is it? Sir, can I ask you something? Tell me. You know... My leader, the most respected Mr. Lakshman Kothadia, is coming to this city today. So? If you give me permission, I can go there. Get lost! We have guests coming today. Go and do your work. -Go! --Okay, sir. Bloody Pawanaputra Bhede! His name sounds like some king who fought and lost against the British. He's named after our God. Otherwise, I'd have gone for his throat. Hey Pawan! Bring me a cup of tea! Yes, sir! âª This night, âª âª This very night! âª âª The moon was shattered, âª âª And moonlight, erased, âª Namaste, countrymen! I am Arnab Goswami, and you are watching, "The Nation wants to know!" My dear countrymen, after eight days, I have come out of the prison. Hey! Can you reduce the volume of the TV? What, sir? Can you reduce the volume of the TV? They won't listen to me, sir. They are North Indians. They are our only customers during this Covid period. They don't need music or dance now. They just want to watch that fellow! Then... ask them to shout less! If the cops come hearing this noise, all of us will be thrown out. You know, right? Social distancing! What social distancing, sir? These guys have a convention today, at our boat house grounds. They have come for that. Please adjust, sir. I can bring the drinks to your room upstairs, sir. It's alright. Get me the bill. And pack a pint bottle too. Sir, you'll be checking out tomorrow, right? Yes. âª This night, âª âª This very night! âª âª Where History once slept and rose in peace.., âª âª Recent wrongs have castled up âª âª Old wounds fester here, now, âª âª By the salty waves of the sea of sin... âª âª On this night.., âª âª Thisâ¦ very night! âª âª If happenstanceâ¦ joins hands with destiny.., here, âª âª Itâs Apocalypseâ¦! âª âª That blood-stained finale, âª âª itâd be unimaginable! âª âª Suchâ¦ is the swelling surge of the past.., âª âª The battle song of Karma! âª âª The end of story? âª âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª âª This Night, âª âª This very night! âª âª The moon was shattered, âª âª And moonlight, erased, âª âª On this very nightâ¦! âª I'll try asking here. Brother, where can I buy a lamp as a gift? Go straight and then take a right turn. Straight and then right? -Yes. -Thank you. Hey Potty! Your Holiness! Hey! Wear this mask! Abdullah Marakkar! Hey specso! You little devil! You and your mask! A much more deadly virus is right in front of you! I saw a beautiful hand. Must be your better half, right? Hello! -What's your name? -Her name is... Prabha. He is an old friend of mine. Abdullah. What? Old friend of yours? Are there 'old' and 'new' among friends? Where are you going, searching for a lamp? I'm going for a colleague's house-warming function. That's why... -Where are you based now? -Thiruvananthapuram. I came here to attend this function. Thiruvananthapuram? If you have to fill petrol and drive all the way till here from Thiruvananthapuram, your colleague must be no ordinary guy! Well, he is a close friend. Apart from me, you have only one friend here, right? That bugger! That bloody son of a gun, Ramkumar. But he has been in England for the past 18 years. This is another friend. I told you, right? My colleague. How's your mother now? Mother! So, you remember.... right? She died.... a week back. Didn't you go to your hometown? To the place where your ancestral house stood? What hometown! It's all gone! Wiped out! When I got out of the mental asylum, the first thing they told me was... ... not to go back to old places. Nostaliga is not meant for lunatics, apparently. Mental asylum? But... Abdu hasn't forgotten old wounds, by the way. I became a lunatic because of that wound, right? He's not here, right? Who? Ramkumar Nair. Do you have his number? No. He had forgotten us long back itself, right? It's been around 12 years since I spoke to him. Even if you have his number, I know that you won't give it to me. But you should inform him... that my mother who trusted, fed and took care of him and his father, is no more now. Come, let's go! Oops! Hey Missus! I am not a troublemaker. You can buy the lamp and go at your own pace. I'm leaving. I was just... Brahmand Solutions. That's an awesome name. Is that your number? No, no. This one... The office number is different. Only the landline is functioning now. You bloody veggie! Oh no! Forgive me! Please forgive me! I didn't know! Well, do we really have to buy a lamp? This is a business meeting, right? Of course! We have to! Let his heritage resort have a lamp from us. Who is he? Indecent fellow! No mask... and he was reeking of alcohol. Ramkumar, Abdullah and I studied together in Moothedath school here. Have you studied here, Potty? My father was the temple priest here at a Lord Narasimha temple, long back. I studied here from my 4th to 10th grades. You're still sweating quite a bit. No way! Seems like he was the school bully back then. -You got scared, right? -By bully, you mean? Rowdy! Oh! That bully! When he asked you about Ramkumar, why did you lie to him? Err... Well... It will be a problem if I say it. Why should I... Don't go there and say that we met Abdullah on the way, okay? I won't say anything. What was the issue between them? Tell me that story. I'm getting bored. Dad! Read what's written on that poster. Poster of the movie 'Midhunam' Don't humiliate me, Abdu. Please try, Dad. The first letter is 'M'. The second letter... ... looks like Taj Mahal turned upside down. Doesn't it? Do you like Mammookka (Mammootty) or Lalettan (Mohanlal), Uncle? Nothing like that, son. If they act well, I like both Ikka and Ettan. Whom do you like? I like Rajinikanth! -Wasn't it Kamal Haasan? -Well, I changed sides. Why? Style! Isn't that Mr. Nair? Yes, Dad. Come and get in, Nair. Ah! Basheerkka! - Come, Rama. - No, Dad! Let's keep walking. Come on! -Abdu, you go to the back seat. -Okay, Dad. Hey! We were on our way there. -Abdu! -Yes! Rama... Come, get inside. All of you are here, huh? -No. I'll get in through the other side. -Okay. His bloody car! Show-off! My umbrella! Peace be unto you, Basheerkka. You needn't greet me like that, Nair. You can say Namaste. If so... Eid Mubarak, Basheerkka. Eid Mubarak! Raman gets chicken biriyani only once in a year, for this festival of yours. Right, son? Advocate Menon must have reached, right? Yes, Menon has reached. I came out with Abdu, making Menon wait at home. Abdu couldn't go to school for the past two weeks, due to typhoid. So, he wanted to get some notebooks from Potty. On the way back, I brought Potty also along. Potty? Is the High Priest home? No. He has gone to the temple. -Oh. -It's the temple festival, Nair. Don't you remember all this? Where do I have the time to think about all this? I'm neck deep in debts. You know, right? Dad, they are here. Allah! Hey Kalyanam! Don't call him that! Kalyan. That's his name. Dad let me bring the bat and ball. Come, let's play. Menon! Did you get bored, sitting alone? -No. -Come. Come, Nair. -Rehana, Aisha.. -Yes, Mom! What is it, Mom? -Take this there, children. -I'll take this. Don't take that. -Here, take this. -I'll take this. Rehana, serve Sarbath to them. Which country is this company from, Nair? Advocate... France. -The name is Accadio. -Oh God! All over the world, in all the seven continents, they have hotels. They are coming to our town too. Isn't that a matter of pride, Ikka? I like mutton. But since you people prefer chicken, we decided to go with Chicken Biriyani. Where is Potty? Different people have different habits, right? We shouldn't feed the priest's son, at a table where we're having mutton, chicken and beef. He's having his vegetarian lunch inside. Did you take your medicine? Hey! Have your lunch, son. Give him this glass of water. Have your food, Nair. Ikka... The party from France has arrived. They are staying at a big hotel in Kozhikode. Once you nod yes, they will be here. They have brought a white lady, especially for this. -Some more? -No. If it happens, this will be their first venture in Kerala. And you will be the one who benefits from this, Basheerkka. Your entire future will be secured in one go. I'm aware of that. But it's the land where my ancestral house stood, Menon. It's around 400 years old. You know, right? Jumma prayers were offered here, earlier. The property is only around 8 acres. That's the only asset I can leave behind for my children. I have two daughters! And I have a heart problem too. We're hungry, Mother! I feel really exhausted while walking now. We've been seeing each other since the time we were running around in our underpants, Basheerkka. Do you have to explain all this to us? Right, Menon? They just need the four acres of land by the beach. And you'll get a good price too. You can use it to buy another property, or deposit it in a bank. However you look at it, it's profitable. If not anything else, if you want to use that money to renovate this house, you can do that too. There's no point holding on saying that it's a heirloom, Basherrkka. If you can't maintain it properly, all this is just stone and sand. Don't worry, Basheerkka. What's the revenue that this property generates now? Just the coconuts and shoots from these odd coconut trees. If you want to chop off all these coconut trees at this old age, and start cultivating new crops, it's not possible because the wind here is salty. Though you're a Marakkar, since you've never really gone to sea, even fishing business won't work for you. That's true. The foreigners have come here especially because... this property has such a beach frontage. When there's such an opportunity, if you don't sell it for a good price, you'd regret it later on. I'll tell you one thing. The coastal rules are going to change. That's why the foreigners are in a hurry. Once the law changes, not just them... Even we can't do anything. If they leave, you won't get a fair price for that part of your land. Remember that! That's not what I'm thinking about. I wanted to ask this to you. How come the foreigners decided to buy this, all of a sudden? That's something which hasn't happened so far. Oh! So you didn't know? No. Who is our Prime Minister now? Narasimha Rao. He has initiated an exuberant phase which has never happened in this country so far. Have you heard about 'globalisation'? No. Globalisation means that... One. The foreigners will give us cash in hand, to run their business in our country. Two. We accept that money and run the foreigners' empire, right here. Three. It will fill the pockets of the foreigners and us, at the same time. That is globalisation. How is Narasimha Rao? How's that? But... like Musaliyar said... this Rao just watched silently with his hands tied, when that mosque was demolished. How can he be at fault for that? If so many people make up their mind to do it, what can the Government do? Enough, sister. My stomach is full. Aisha! Careful. Aisha, dear... Rehana... Come here, girls. Wear your Hijab properly, clean your hands and go. Whom do you wish to marry, Rehana? Aamir Khan. -What about you, Aishu? -Salman Khan. You needn't take Muslim names alone, out of your fear for me. Take the names you really like. -Shall I say it? -No. -Shall I say it? -No. She likes Aravind Swamy. -Who is he? -I have no idea! Heard their wishes? Is it possible... ... if you hold on to this field which has only weeds, bushes and dry coconuts? Hey Ram! Throw it at his leg. Come on! Throw it! Come on, Ram! Pace! Pace! Malcolm Marshall. You're finished, Abdullah! We are with you, right? We just need your signature, Ikka. And you needn't do it blindly. We'll bring the agreement, and Advocate Menon will read out every word and every letter to you. You need to sign it only if you're satisfied after listening to it. I told you, right? If this sale happens, it will benefit us too. Even after all these years, I'm still not well settled, Ikka. My only house is mortgaged. I can't afford the rent of the house in which I'm staying now. I'm sinking! Neck deep in debts! I need to save Ram at least. How's that? And then? Then... nothing more! Ramkumar's resort where we're headed to now, is situated on that property. When we go there with this lamp, he will instantly understand that we're going there after talking about all this. He's a bloody shark! So, forget whatever I told you so far. Yeah, right! As if I have no other job than remembering this flashback! We're neck deep in debts. I just hope Ram makes a huge investment. Then, don't ask me anything more about the past. Understood? Don't tell him that we met Adullah Marakkar. You make sure that you don't blurt it out. Me? So... where are those two girls? I don't know! Where was Abdullah working? He was in Mumbai. He was in a mental asylum, apparently. It would be a surprise if he didn't go crazy. Tall, Latino, Ebony, Dusky, MILF... These are your current favourites, right? Fair enough! Or rather, unfair enough. Psst! Is this why you said that this one's better than the resort at Southampton? We don't have to give the parasailing option to the guests here. That's for sure. The mosquitoes can take them parasailing. The window netting team will come day after tomorrow. I've arranged it. My dear man, our first customers are coming this weekend. It's a high profile entry. I'll manage that. You don't worry. I have to worry and I will worry. Accadio looks for my signature in the quality check documents. Not yours. Is it? If that's the case, you've taken the quotation for the CCTV installation, right? What's happening with that? Isn't it part of quality check? Isn't that a basic need of a luxurious resort which has relics worth at least a millon dollars? I'll get it installed. But that will be the least of my priorities. First, you install a mosquito net. I'll get the CCTV installed after that. Bloody shit! Accadio Saket. What must be the meaning of it? Accadio is a French word. Saket is a Sanskrit word. He's quite impressive! Isn't anybody around? Let me check. Hello! Hello! Hail Lord Ram! Yes. Ram! Is he inside? -He was just greeting you. -Is it? Park the car over there. -Over there? -Yes. I understood what he said. I was just pulling his leg. You didn't get that, huh? I did! You're lucky that he didn't pull your leg! Potty... Don't take that lamp now. We can ask the watchman to bring it if required. Hello brother! Give me time for two more days. I've come to Vadakara to make an arrangement. No. I'll do it. Definitely! Sorry! Hello, Your Holiness! -I'll call you back! -Mr. Curd Rice! Ram! Long time! This is my wife, Prabha. -Hello. -Hey Prabha! How are you? Fine. -You look gorgeous. -Thank you. Don't I always tell you to wear the Sari properly? Didn't you see how he was looking? He's just named Ram. He's actually a Ravan. -What? -Well... It's quite a costly construction. -Costly! -Let that be! - Is this your car? -Yes. -Pathetic! -Why? How will you impress top-tier business clients, without a premium sedan, at least? You're still the same old miser, huh? What's that lamp on the back seat? We bought it for our house. There's a really nice shop in the market here. -If you like it, you can take it. -Get lost! I don't allow such cheap items even anywhere near this place. Come, I wanna show you something. Welcome... .. to the Accadio Saket! Thank you, dear! We are the number one luxury stay chain in the world. ACS, Bechtel, Vinci and Skanska... ... come only after us. - Is it? We focus on sea-side properties. We have 116 coastal home-stay properties currently. Superb! Across the world! -The sun never sets on the Accadio Saket! -Wonderful. Those who come here, walk along with history, breathe history, eat along with history, and sleep with history. Hey! Do you know the tariff here for one night? 3 Lakhs plus taxes. You won't understand all that, you Veggie! It's a million dollar game! Everything you see here... ... are historical relics. Very very costly, and specially curated for the Accadio Saket. Like our tagline suggests, the guests pay us to 'Stay among the relics'. Wow! -Beautiful. -Yes! -These are? -See! To understand style and substance, you need a classy eye. I like that! See this! This is from Chandragupta Maurya's period. We have twelve of them, on either side of the pathway. Saw that? It's from Krishnadevarayar's period. Come! There's much more to see! Wow! Hey! This! This is awesome! Broken Ganesha! Superb design! I love modern art! This is true art! Must be imported from America, right? Get lost. This is not modern art! Hey Pawan! -Pawan! -Yes, sir! Take this away! Put it in the basket and keep it on your head. I was going to throw it, sir. -What? -I was going to throw it. Then go and throw it, you ass! You come! Bloody Ganesh Visarjan! Now it's here too! Its hands, head, trunk, rat, Laddoos and what not, are lying all over my private beach. I asked him to throw it away and he has kept it here. *******! Come! -Ram, should I remove my shoes? -No, come. What is this? A museum? Hey! Here's our guest for the night. -Hello! -Hi! -Parameshwaran Potty, right? -Yes. Potty, this is Mythili. This is his wife, err... Prabha! Can you please take them around? -I'll take this call and come. -Sure. Hello! Please come. You can see the interiors. Mythili... this? The Greek Thinker. It's the only other replica of the thinker. This is from Accadio's original collection. Okay. Everything else was procured by us at Saket. These relics are Accadio Saket's USP. Our priceless relics gallery. Incidentally, this is the Accadio-Saket partnership's vanguard property. Oh, I see! Yeah, yeah! I'll meet them. -Come. -Yeah, sure. Now I'll show them around. You may please go and... ... get something to drink. -Come. -Hey Ram! This one? This is... This is Hitler, right? Yes. Made in wax! Who's this bald head? Benito Mussolini. These guys had killed a lot of people, right? Hey! It's a really bad omen... ... to place these guys at the entrance. -What do you even know? -Have you heard their speeches? -Yeah, right! "Bhaiyon aur Behanon" No one can beat that! Get lost! -I'm sorry. -Come. Mahatma Gandhiji. Hey! Aren't these Gandhiji's spectacles? Yes! I bought it during an action.... ... for 350,000 Dollars. -Oh! This is an ancient statue. An extremely rare piece of art. Wow! Che Guvera! What's this vanity bag doing here? It's a backpack he used when he was in Bolivia. I bought it when I got it for a good price. Just 250,000 Dollars. Wow! Safdar Hashmi. There's a lot to say about him. But this is the pen he used, while he was working in Economic Times. A very valuable piece! This is awesome! This is a great omen! You should be keeping this at your entrance! Lord Krishna! Bless me! You idiot! This is not Lord Krishna! This is NTR. NT Rama Rao. This is a famous character he played. He became the Chief Minister twice in Andhra, doing all this. You are too much! -So he was a Chief Minister too? -No! Panchayat President! Hey! Don't touch that! -Don't touch! -I won't. These are all antiques from Africa, that are worth several Lakhs. -If they fall.. - What's this? Hey! No! It's just an extension. -Come. -Keep a distance from him. The coin used by THE Amitabh Bachchan in the movie, Sholay. You've seen it only in the movie, right? In real! The dagger used by Jhansi Rani, to kill the British. This is it. This is my hero! Can you say who it is? Who is it? -Stalin! -Oh yeah! Karunanidhi's son! You... How do you run a company without a minimum general knowledge? And this is the legendary Dhyan Chand Singh's hockey stick. Wow! Cricket bat! Hey! This is the bat with which Kapil Dev scored 175 not out, against Zimbabwe in the Prudential Cup, 1983. Phew! You know at least that, huh? -Did you tell him anything? -No. See! We won't get a chance after this. I have to go back. -Please! -I don't know! I will tell him. But you have to... What game is this? What? This is a game played by the Americans, right? That? It's baseball, you idiot. Sundown, guests! -Let there be light! -It's sunset. I'll show you our night mode now. Wow! Peter Hofer. Special... double barrel gun? Ram... 224,000 Dollars? Really? This is an isolated place, right? I bought it for self-protection. It's part of my personal collection. Hey! It's fully loaded. Don't play with it. Idiot! You carry on. We're currently a partnership company incorporated in 2014, ...based in Trivandrum. -Yeah, fine. We have an annual turnover of 1 Crore in the last three years. Dude, do you remember... ...Uncle Basheer's Tipu Sultan gun? But it was smaller than this one, right? That reminds me! I forgot to show you someone. Come! One second. Cheers! Come. -Hello guests. -Oh my God! My name is Anastasia Aubert. and I am the founder, initiator of the Accadio homestay network. It's a hologram. One of the world's largest luxury.. Oh my God! This is the old white lady who came that day, right? What is this, man? The same hairstyle. The same frock. The same stance. Oh my God! Hey! You haven't changed at all, huh? You're still that old country bumpkin! -Goodbye. Au revoir. -Wait. Look at this. This is the Accadio Saket fun room. You can see many wonders like this here. Come, let's talk serious business now. So that's the plan. A profitable revamp of your software setup, with clientele predominantly in the U.S., Germany and U.K. -Yes. -Precisely, Ram. I'll tell you something frankly. My business has grown so much... ... because of my shrewdness. Of course, Mythili's money back-up too. Coming back to our point. What is your qualification to run this business? And I've done MBA too. You're referring to the degree from some cheap college in Nagercoil as MBA? There's no M, B or A there. So, forget that. Then... I've noticed it whenever I chat with you. Your English is abysmally poor. Have your drink. Brahmand Solutions. -Who named it? -Me. I knew it. You should change this disgusting name first. There's a way to do all this. Anyway, forget it now. I'll suggest a name. Bram Solutions! -But Brahma.. -Splendid! Wow! Thank you. By the way, who among you is planning to be the CEO? Me. What a successful CEO needs the most, is an impressive command over two European languages, other than English. And last but not the least, a rock solid personality! Don't get me wrong, Potty. You don't have any of this. If so, the most worthless person on this earth, would be Stephen Hawking. He's a scientist, damn it! Let's start with his name! Parameshwaran Potty. How do you spell it in English? P-O-T-T-Y. Just like I thought! Dude, 'Potty' has two meanings in English. One. The thing in which children take a shit. Two. An imbecile. I'm serious! Moreover, westerners never prefer... ... open ending names which end with sounds like 'E' and 'Oo'. Ramkumar, Mythili Ram. Short and pronounceable. What's your full name, Prabha? Prabha Nair. -Are you a Nair? -Yes. -Wow! -There are exceptions even among that. Narayana Swamy, Sundar Pichai, Ambani, Adani... These are all 'E's and 'Oo's, right? We're talking about the CEO of a software company now. A company which I am supposed to be investing in. If I don't have confidence, I won't invest. Be it a friend, colleague or even my father. That's what I'll do. Talking of your father reminds me... When your father got the documents of this property written in his name, from our old Uncle Basheer... He didn't think of continents or confidence like this. Not continents. Countenance! Well, I was just saying. Mythili, if I tell you about what happened back then, I can't imagine what will happen here. It will be a floccinaucinihilipilification. What? He has been listening to Shashi Tharoor's speeches all the time lately, to improve his English. Uncle Basheer? Does this place have such a history? You didn't tell me. Who's this Basheer? Well, this 'Sanket' of yours? -Saket! -Yes, whatever. -Long before this came into being. -Shucks! Those are all old stories! Forget all that, Potty. Please don't subvert the topic. I was saying that... I am ready to help you. But I'm not ready to forget my profit motive. I'm a businessman. That's all. Hey Mythili... Back in the day, he cleared his exams from 4th to 10th grade, copying my notes and answer sheets. -There's not doubt about that anyway! -See! It's not 'not doubt'. -'No doubt'! -Didn't I say so? No! If you have a doubt, ask Prabha. You said 'not doubt'. Have your drink. I will drink. I'll do one thing. I'll bring some snacks. You guys talk. I will invest... ... on one condition. Prabha should be the CEO. She's elegant, articulate, and good looking. What say? What is this? I'm asking you! Go hunting! But even that has some ethics. You need to have that. Is your childhood friend's wife your next target? We owe 2.5 Crores to the bank. Our house and office are facing a seizure notice. Ram is offering us 3 Crores without charging any interest. We don't have any other option. So, please don't create an unnecessary scene here. I know he is flirting with me. I know how to manage that. That's all you have left to do. Go ahead! Get drunk! When you went on a solo trip to Amsterdam, did I ask you who the playboy with you was? No. When you were at Norway countryside for two months with a Negro... Oh! Sorry! That's politically incorrect. You stayed with a 'man of colour' for two months. Did I ask you anything? No! So I will do whatever I want with my friend's wife, or with my aunt's daughter! Can you ask anything? No! So just shut your mouth up! These are the privileges of being affluent and rich! Please enjoy it... and let others also enjoy. Okay? I can't tolerate this. Do whatever you want! Err.. Toilet? Over there... in the fun room. Potty... I'm sorry. You bloody son of a gun, Potty! In the name of saving your business, you took Rs. 75 Lakhs from me and screwed me over! No capital, no interest either! Can't you just pimp your wife instead, you scumbag? Hey Potty! It's me, Abdu. I don't have any issue with you, dude! I know that your dad, the High Priest, had a part to play in this betrayal! But I can forgive that, since it was just a hapless Priest's desperation... ...resulting in unintended evil. My issue is with the other guy! That bloody son of a gun, Ram. I want to see him. But... not to give him a hug. You heard me? See you sometime! This is my number. You can save it, if you really want to! Mythili, where is Prabha? Upstairs, with Ram. Upstairs? -Come, sit. -No, it's okay. How do I go upstairs? End of the hall, at the left, you'll see the staircase. That way? -Yes. -Okay. Another one! Sex is also like money. Only too much is enough! And even when it's bad, it's good! Hey Potty! Come! Look! The night sea! It's a magnificent view from here. Enjoy the view. I'll make a call and come. Okay? You knew him already, right? What is this, Potty? He is a business development consultant. A leading venture capitalist, as well. We've been chatting for the past two years... ... on Instagram. Did you think he'll contact you out of the blue? Has Ram called you in the past 12 years? So... did he chat with me, because you told him to? Did he invite me because you asked him to? Yes! But I know where to draw the line. You don't worry. Dog! You didn't expect me to be here with Ram, right Prabha? No, nothing like that. Don't be apologetic. It's okay. I'm used to this, since maybe ten years. I'm over all that silly stuff. We are just business partners. This marriage is just a... ... working arrangement. This nuptial chain... is only for people. -Cut this, Pawan. -Okay, Madam. About our business... You know, we are in dire straits. I'm... desperate. Prabha... You don't have to explain to me. He is a complete womanizer. And... that's the only way to get to him. This thing called guilt... If you remove that from your mind, life becomes extremely smooth. After all, it's a man-made thing. Or is it woman-made? Do you need any help here? No, no. Just help yourself. Life in here... is a buffet. Here! So that's me... investing 3 Crores... ... to Brahmand. It will be renamed to 'Bram' Solutions. Okay. And here... is Prabha Nair, the C-E-O. And regarding the reporting system, I'll come to that later. Okay. First of all, you need a complete makeover. You have to look sexy and stylish, you know? -Oh! -Get rid of this Sari... and try western outfits. You have a lovely complexion. -You'd look superb. -Thank you. I'll take you out shopping. The first thing you should do... is to get a residence Visa in the UAE. I'll get that done... and you can stay with us. -Okay. -And... you should open a bank account at the Hinduja or Lombard over there. I'll be transferring the money from my Swiss bank account... to this new account of yours. Don't worry about anything. I'll take care of all the nitty-gritties. -Yeah? -Oh! Thank you! Good! Which one did you like among these? These two are nice. Forget this one. Ram has already booked this one. You can take this one. -How's this? -Arabic attire? -This is great. -Do you want it? -No, I don't want it. -Still... -Wear it once for me. -No, dude. -Wear it. -No, dude! You wear it! Shouldn't you be very careful while selling your property, Basheer? And it's a property that has been around since the time of the great Marakkar. Even if you want to buy a similar house and property at such a prime location, can you manage it now? Only God knows how the times are going to change, hereafter. Are you upset that this property is being sold.., ...or the fact that I am selling it to Hindus? Why are you feigning ignorance, Ikka? Are you not aware of what's happening around us? The problem is precisely that you're selling it to the Kafirs. I'll tell you something. I came along with the Musaliyar, after finding a buyer from our faith for your property. Two businessmen from Manjeri are ready. They will pay good money too. Money is not my only consideration, Rahman. What else is your consideration? Musaliyar... This Nair and Menon are like blood brothers to me. When they are asking me something out of sheer need, it would be unfair on my part to refuse them on grounds of religion.., ...and sell it to someone of our faith. I won't do that. That does not befit men of honour like us. You don't have to lecture us about honour. Don't you know that they have killed thousands of our brothers? Or... are you acting like you're unaware of it? We should preserve at least the land we own. Otherwise, they will turn us into outsiders in our own land, soon enough. Rahman! That's enough! Stop it. I'm not giving you a befitting reply, just because you're at my house. How old are you, boy? Tell me. I know this land and the people here, much more than you do. You don't have to teach me all that. Musaliyar, please explain all this to him, when you have the time. It is such hateful thinking that creates big problems. Only if the people help each other to grow and reform, will this land stay alive! Learn to love this country and obey the law of this land, first. Everything else will become alright on its own. No wonder you don't have a prayer bump on your forehead. Prayer bump, huh? There are Muslims here, who pray five times a day, and still don't have a prayer bump. It's just that you haven't seen such people. So don't tell me that. Musaliyar... you don't have to worry. I'm not selling the entire property. Just those four acres by the beach. The rest of the property and this house will still be with me. Now, don't be upset. Drink the juice, lad! Mom, look at Potty! How does he look? Abdu, don't make him play the fool. Take it off! Why? He looks really good! "Sheikh Potty Bin Melshanthi"! Sahib... The High Priest is here. -Is it time to take him back home? -Yes. Abdu! Potty's father is here to take him back. Bring him here. Come on, Sheikh Potty. Hey! Hey! Behave yourself! Why are you standing there, Potty? Have a seat. Dad, look at him! Sheikh Potty. What the hell are you doing, Abdu? Don't you dare play mischief with anything and anyone. Go inside and take it off, son. Go. Please don't mind it, Priest. You know my son, right? Please don't bother. They are children, it's natural. I don't send you here so that you can dress up like a fool and humiliate me! That boy can't write notes by himself or what? Should you go over and help him everyday? They are uncivilized people. Don't forget that. Show me your hand. Don't eat whatever they give you. What is this? This is a dress that Abdu gave me. Come on, walk! Ass! Come on! Potty! You just want to stand here? Come! I'll show you a great state-of-the-art home theatre. Come on! Come, dude! Prabha! Hey! Look! It's an 8K projection. You can watch movies, TV channels... Moreover, you can even watch porn in a theatre effect. Come, I'll show you. Sit down, man! What do you want to watch? Horror? Comedy? Action? Or....? Let's start. Hey Potty! Your favourite actor is still Rajinikanth, right? Come on. Annamalai is not available. I can't find Baasha. 'Muthu'. Is 'Muthu' okay? Yes, 'Muthu' is fine. Play it. -Go forward. -Huh? Fast forward! Some more. Some more. Yes, stop here. Play it. Pause! Pause, pause! Raghuvaran usurped the father Rajinikanth's properties, using forged documents. The son Rajinikanth was a child then. But Raghuvaran is up for a shock. The father Rajinikanth will forgive Raghuvaran. Out of that depression, Raghuvaran will commit suicide. A similar story has happened right here, in this property too. But the one who committed suicide, was not the betrayer. It was the betrayed. That Abdullah? Where is he now? Who knows! He fled from this town long ago, right? What about his sisters? I saw it on a school WhatsApp group which I was part of, earlier. That the two of them are somewhere in Syria, apparently. But only God knows who they are with, and what condition they are in. That country is going through a revolt and war, right? Well, you should be knowing about all this first. You can see news channels also on this. Where's Mythili? Let me go downstairs. You're spoiling it. Idiot! There are several reports about the increasing crime rates in this city, sir. Is it because of the indifference of the police? What do you have to say about this? Ever since I took charge here, law and order issues have dropped considerably. I can show you the statistics. Isn't this our Kalyanam? Hey! Don't call him that. Kalyan! That's his name. Wait. I was going to give you a surprise. He is the proxy fund manager of Accadio Saket in Kerala. Women's safety, child safety... Police have undertaken large scale surveillance measures in these fronts. He's a silent partner of all this too. -He's a DIG in the police. -I've heard that. And the surprise is that... ...he is coming here. In some time. It's good to have a police connection in your business too. You talk to him. You can stay here and leave tomorrow. After dinner, I need to have some deep discussions with Prabha. Even if I go back to Southampton, Prabha will have to come there. I'll be signing the papers over there. Hey Potty! There's no such thing as a free lunch. You got me, right? -What? -Sir, a man is here. Who? Who are you? Sir wants to know. Sir, he's saying that he's your friend. Hey! Kalyan Menon is here. Send him in. Okay. You may go inside. Hey Kalyan! Where is my friend? He went to the backside, sir. Backside? Why? How do I know, sir? Come, let's go and check. Kalyan! Who is this? Who is this? Father! Yes! What is it, son? Are you fine, father? Of course! We lost everything! And yet you are fine? That's right, father. Heard what my father said? "So what if we lost the house, son... They have built us a Jannat-Ul-Firdaus here!" Abdullah Marakkar. How did he reach here? The house that Ram built... ... is just like you building a house for me. Abdu... We lost everything, son. Everything! We lost your father too! Abdu... Mother! Aishu had called me over the phone. She told me that... she will be going to the city, with her husband. We need to find where they are. We need to find who took her. Promise me, son. Promise your mother. The promise of a madman... What value does it have, mother? Mother! Two women among the 174 people who died in the bomb attack at Syria... I heard that they were Beevuamma's daughters. We didn't tell her that because she was ailing. Aisha! Rehana! Aisha! Rehana! Brother... Save us from here, brother! Save us, brother! Brother... Brother! Here stood almost 500 years ago, an original structure built by successors... ... of the great Naval captain of Kerala, Kunjali, the Third, also known as Kunjali Marakkar. Hey Potty! Your Holiness, do you want to bowl? Go and be the Umpire, you ass! I will bowl...! Pace! Pace! Malcolm Marshall..!! You are finished, Abdullah! When you destroy something, you should destroy it completely. -Ramakumara! -Abdu, no! -Hey! Louder! You should scream a little louder! No one will hear it even then. Though he's rich and famous now, Abdu, please. there's no sign of a human here to respond to a scream here. So, if this Abdu decides to take revenge for everything that happened in the past, there's no one here to say it to the outside world. Right? Will you say it? Abdu, no! Let go of him. Abdu, please. The way you've caught me now... Is it for me to kill him... or not to kill him? -To kill him. I mean, not to kill him. Abdu, please. Got scared? "Your Holiness!" I was kidding! It's just a show. But you....!! You should be scared. Because this is Abdu's night. Do you have a doubt? Look! Sir! Don't look at the moon today. It's the Ganesh Chathurthi festival today. You will be cursed. Who are you, you little devil? Bhede. Pawanputra Bhede. Pawanputra Bhede? Come on! Let's talk! I've kept everything ready, Madam. This is Pulao, this is Paratha... This is Aloo Gobi and this is Matar Paneer. -Okay. -Call me if there's anything. Is it okay if I stay over tonight with my uncle and friends, and come back tomorrow afternoon, Madam? Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram! Mythili... Why is he dressed like this? He's a member of Kothadia's party. Let him go. That's better. Sir, I'm talking about the rules. I gave them permission because... ...they had promised that not one person more than thousand people... ...will be there at the grounds to listen to his speech. But sir, I had already informed you, right? Sir, more than 400 of his supporters from different states... ...have been staying in different hotels here for the past one week. How many people are attending this meeting? Already 2000 plus, sir. There's full media coverage too. Almost all the COVID protocols have been flouted, sir. In that case, you should have taken a call. You're the Commissioner of this city, right? Who is in charge there now? 2 ACP's, 4 CI's.... and almost more than a hundred constables are there at the spot, sir. In that case, we have to think of something more effective. Revel among relics, live in history. This is good. It's good to have the company of at least one thief who's bigger than you. Oh! Wow! -Did you call? -Yes. The cops will come now. Saddam Hussein's favourite brand of wine. Woah! I must try this drink, Ram! Yuck! Stale black tea! So everything here is fake, right? Deception during betrayal..! Catch it! Oh no! You're impressive, Ram! You've kept your old cunningness intact. Bloody shit! Accadio Sanctum. Accadio believes in preserving origins. Hey! It's just an extension. Let's go there and talk peacefully. "Awake! For morning in the bowl of night... ...has flung the stone that puts the stars to flight." Abdu, no! "And lo, the hunter of the east has caught..." , After destroying history, under the false pretence of preserving history, after taking a foundation brick from the remains of that destroyed history, after placing that stone in a prayer room covered in green, and after posting a pseudo historic caption below it, you invite the students of history from lands afar, ...hoodwink them, rob them of their precious money... ...to lead this luxurious life of yours! Hats off.... Ram! When I see all this, as a bosom friend of yours, I can ideally react... in two ways: Either, be proud of the fact that you are still nurturing your old ancestral skill of living off betraying others, be proud that it still has been a profitable proposition for you, and be proud that you have become a great success in life. I can gatecrash here, celebrate your success with a drink or two, be happy for you and go back to my world. Or I can be shocked and jealous seeing all this glitter, drink your booze, enjoy your hospitality, and puke it out before I go back to my world. But this beautiful night.... ...is expecting neither from me. For, the real owner of all that you see here... ...happens to be me! In your father's betrayal, in this empire that you've built, in this property where we're sitting now, had fallen the tears of my family, my mother and my sisters, and you know that. You also know that this has been built upon my father's blood. If someone is well aware of the crime he has committed, and still continues to live his life, enjoying all the privileges that came with it, without feeling even an iota of remorse, then a Judgement becomes inevitable, because justice has to be served. A verdict! That one double-edged word, which resides within both 'justice'... ...and 'revenge'. 'Theerppu'. Till now, I had wished only to give a tight slap across your face, if I ever ran into you. But... not anymore. Your husband's history of betrayal... ... has just begun unravelling. The three of you are the jury here. I am Abdullah Marakkar... The Supreme Judge, here. What's your name? Mythili. Wow! Everything is perfect! Go ahead! Narrate the rest of the story yourself. The Advocate read the agreement aloud for my father. What was it? That we'll take only the beachfront and the adjacent 4 acres, and that we won't touch the rest. This story of this treachery by your king and his daddy, can't be confined to a single movie, my dear. It's as vast as, say, a "Game of Thrones". Tell us the next scene, Ram. Say it, man! Mr. Menon... Mr. Nair... We need that ancient house along with the beachfront property. Not just the beachfront property. They're asking for the house too. She'll cancel the deal if she doesn't get the entire property. Else, we just drop this deal altogether. Or else, she'll drop this deal. -What? -Just come with me. Just a minute. I'll be right back. Please wait. Hey! Look! What is it? Look at her hair, dude. It's really nice, right? What? Is this really necessary? When the tile company ran into losses and I was in debt of millions, I had begged your landlord dad to help me out. He didn't give me a single penny. So, you better shut up! Menon, please come. What is it, Nair? Now stop gawking and study! -What is it? -Come with me. What should we tell her now? If we agree to this, it should profit us too, right? That, she will ensure. -She must! -How? A foreign company cannot come to India... ... and start something on its own, as of now. They have to buy land in the name of an Indian citizen first, and then, he has to lease it to the company. Or else, we must make these foreigners our overseas partners, for the trade that we're conducting here. It will work out, right? There won't be any problem, right? If you ask me so... what we're going to do, is completely problematic! So, first you decide... whether we have to do it or not. Let me know after that. I didn't mean that. I... err... You go ahead. I'm listening. Are you sure? I am sure. Then I'll tell you one more fact. If people without a conscience, start acting as if they have a conscience, it will not only be difficult for them, but also for the others who are trying to help them out. So... stop this 'acting', first. This is your only opportunity. We're giving Lakhs to Basheerkka, right? And not for free, right? I'll make the necessary corrections... ...in the agreement that we read out to him. Leave that to me. Get the property registered in your name first. You don't have to be so guilty about it. What about you then? Your share? After we sign the deal with them, I'll draft another agreement, which will be between the two of us. Since the moral risk in this case is totally yours, from the profit we make from this deal, 80% will be yours. 20% will be mine. We need to ask one more thing. After your death, your son needs to have a hold over the company and the profit. Also, the profit sharing between Ram and Kalyan, shall continue to be on the same terms. Okay? We are ready. But there are certain conditions. Okay! Book Cricket Ramkumar - 4, Abdullah - 2 Sahib, the agreeement was read out to you, right? -Yes. -You want to read it once again? No. The advocate had read it out to me. You can sign here. I don't know how to sign. Do you have a stamp pad? Get him the stamp pad. -Where? -Over here. Yes! Six! Come on, continue. Your turn. Hey Nair! Don't tell him that I'm here. Are you studying? -No. We're playing the game of dots. -Carry on! Nair! Hey Nair! Sahib.... That white lady's people are asking me to vacate my house. Did you add our home too to the sale deed? Sahib, let us sit inside and talk. Just give me a yes or no. Did you add my home too, when you wrote the sale deed? Oh no, Sahib! I didn't write the agreements, right? It was the foreign company people, right? Didn't I ask you to sign it only after hearing what's written in the agreement? Since you can't read, Advocate Menon had read it out for you, right? He is inside, right? Yes. Didn't I read out everything? It was an agreement to sell the whole property. In the agreement you read out to me, it was specifically stated that they will take only the beachfront area, and won't touch my house and surroundings. Wasn't it so? No. That's not what we said or read out. Even if that was the case, you stand to lose nothing. You're getting eight lakhs for the whole property including the house. Isn't that a huge amount? You can repay all your debts, well, to an extent, with that. If not anything else, you can at least meet your own medical expenses properly, right? Longevity is more important than anything else, right? I haven't come to talk about the money, Nair. The two of you made me sell off my house as well, huh? That house has played host even to the Prophet's disciples. Do you know that? Leave alone quoting a price for it, I can't even imagine selling it. Not just me. No one can do that. Even if you think about doing that, God will not forgive you. Let go of him, Basheerkka. There's no point in manhandling us after signing the documents. Without spite or hatred in one's mind, if one forgives the sinners, it is supposed to be equal to offering a thousand prayers. But... for what you have done here now, sooner or later, you will have to face retribution. A 'Theerppu'! But it won't be from me. It will be from Allah! What's your problem now? Whatever I am doing is legal. Legal? Sooner or later, you, me and our son Ram, will have to suffer for this. Wait and watch! He cursed you from the bottom of his heart. At least go, fall at his feet and seek his forgiveness! Children shouldn't be around when elders are talking. Go inside, son. Priest.., This country existed for so long... ... only because of a mutual understanding. Right? When my Uncle from the Arabia said that I should be sent to a school, my father told my uncle, "He has this field" "This farm" "We just have to save money" "This country is a good place" "This country and its people... ... will never create any trouble" "We can hire people to read and write for us" "You just have to be able to afford it" It was my father's last word. An old Hajiyar's verdict. You can call it arrogance too. My father trusted this country so much! Though the tears of my entire family has fallen on this land today, I understood a fact. That you people are not my friends... ... and you can never be, either. Never! I've always considered you like my own brother, Nair. And yet, you did this to us? Where will we go with these three children? Beewathu... You go inside. Women don't have to come out and assert. Got it? How many days do I have left, to vacate? They have to start work within two days. But you can take a week, Ikka. To pack all this, you'll need... I'll handle all that. You both may leave now. I will shift from here. I will shift within two days. Well... Aren't you taking your children along? Forgot that too? Aren't you doing all this for their sake? Abdu! Send your friends out. Abdu, my book? Sahib... One share of the profit we make from this business, will be yours.... Allah! Do I have to hear that too, Nair? My footwear... I was furious at my father, that day. "What you did was a grave sin, Dad" "It's an unforgivable sin"... I said all that. That's Malcolm Marshall bowling and the ball hits the bat and he's gone! He's gone! This will put an end to Abdu's bragging! Come here! My dad slapped me on my face that day. That pain still remains on this cheek. Sorry to say this, sir. Sir is not at all co-operative. What do you mean? Please, please. Now don't make this an ego tussle between you two. I do this all the time, right? Move away. What's this new habit? What's with this new habit? What are you doing? Have it, all of you. How's your father's Biriyani? It's delicious, father! Eat until your tummy is full, dear. After paying off the debts, I have deposited the remaining Rs. 2 Lakhs in the bank, in your name. Here are the documents. In the bank? In my name? Yes! And... I sold our car. For scrap price. What's the point in keeping it now? Why are you saying all this now? You will be with us, no? All of us... ... can shift to my sister's house in Manjeri. Though it's not as spacious, it's a good house. She will have some company too. Eat, dear. Have your food, Abdu. They know what happened to my father. Father! You left us, huh? You left us? Father! Coward! Coward! You left us? You left us behind? Father! Father! Father! It's okay even if we lose the land, Musaliyar. We should at least stop them from demolishing the house. For my husband! He loved it more than anything. Nothing is possible now, Beewathu. There will be a huge ruckus. They will riot all over town. Nothing is possible now. You may go. Wait. There is one way. When are they going to demolish it? Immediately. Achu's son Chandrabhanu is working at the archaeological department in the town. Let's go and meet him. We can find out if there are some Government rules that may help us. Why do you have to take so much effort, Musaliyar? We too have boys with us! Let them start a riot. We'll reply in the same coin. Shut up, boy! Riots and fights may not always be won by the side of truth. Even if a truthful minority fights with the majority, it's the majority that ends up winning, most of the time. You know that? So shut up and go home! Get lost! Oh my God! This is 400 years old. If only a quarter of it has been demolished so far, we can stop the demolition, and find ways to make the Government preserve the house, at least. You delayed it so far, despite having this with you? You keep preventing your children from going to schools and studying English, and keep sending them to your Madrasas. And finally your documents and properties will be usurped by people who can read and write. Someone come with me. No. Just one of you. Abdu... Go with him, son. Come, come! -Son.. -Yes, mother. You shouldn't get anxious. Your mother has no one else. Hey! That Archaeology officer is coming. Detonate it. Quickly! Make it fast! Hey! Stop it! Don't demolish it. This is illegal. -Demolish it! -Quick! Do it quickly! No! Stop it. -Don't demolish it. -What are you doing, Abdu? Someone stop him. Don't go there. -Stop it. -Abdu! Stop him! Abdu, stop. Abdu! Abdu! Son... Abdu! Hey Abdu! What does... ... the Jury say? What punishment will bring justice? From this silence, I should understand that... the majority does not approve of any kind of punishment. Forget it. Does the Jury at least acknowledge the fact that a crime was committed here? Then... against the majority, and with conscience as the only witness, Abdullah Marakkar, the Supreme Judge must proclaim the judgement. The final judgement. An ancient house which had a history of centuries. A house which was demolished through treachery. For orchestrating that demolition, and for conspiring towards it, for being the beneficiary of that betrayal, for gaining social and financial stature through it, for causing a death due to that betrayal, and for being responsible for a family that was lost in the streets, V. Ramkumar Nair, son of Vikraman Nair has been sentenced by this Court, this Court of God, ...to death! Hey Abdu! What is this? Sit down! You should see certain things before you are killed. You should also experience... ...the trauma of losing everything that you hold dear in life. The shock of seeing things getting destroyed right in front of your eyes. But... ... your mother? She died ten years back. She suffered a lot. She had tuberculosis. Ah! Good people are always like that. They die only after suffering a lot. She liked you a lot. She always used to talk about you. But my dear Ram, dead people are not going to know... ... who died and who killed whom. But you don't have to be scared. Since you're not a good man, you will never suffer before you die. Everything will be quick. Well... Should we not toss a coin before the match begins, Potty? How can we forget old habits so easily? Yes! Hey! Don't move! -Call the police! -They will come now. Where is Kalyan? He's not answering. Amitabh Bachchan's dialogue from "Sholay" Wow! I've found the perfect item! âª We shall never break this friendship of ours âª Song from 'Sholay' I'll give you one chance. Heads or tails? -Heads! -Wait! If it's heads, I will kill you. If it's tails, I won't. Hey Ram! Even your relics are saying that I should kill you. Heads! Death by relics. The cricket bat used by Kapil Dev when he scored 175... Wow! Is this for real? No one could watch that innings back then. BBC was on strike. But today, the highlights of that thunderous innings, you can watch it live. Wow! Abdu... -Potty, stop him. -Stop it! Well... I need a ball to play cricket. Ball? Yes! The foundation stone of my palace which was demolished. Let it be our cricket ball for tonight. Hey Potty! You do the bowling. Do you remember? These guys never gave you bowling or batting back then. You were always the umpire. Potty Bird! Today you will bowl... I will bat, and he will be the umpire. This... ... will be our stumps. Throw it. Throw it! We'll know now, if this is Kapil Dev's original bat, or fake like Saddam Hussein's wine. Okay. First ball. Shot! This is original, indeed! He should have been here too. Kalyan Menon! -Where is he? -He is in the Police. He's a DIG. -He will come now. -It's alright. He's a cop, right? He'll come only after the villain dies. He's also a partner in this company. It's not like messing with me. Hey Ram! If your father was the Dhritharashtra in this story, Advocate Menon was the Shakuni. If you are Duryodhan, he is Dusshasan. So first, I'll break your thigh! After that, I will tear open his chest! Hey Potty! Announce the score. Six! Hail Lakshman Sena! Hail Kothadiyaji! Hail Chandran Pillaji! Hail Lakshman Sena! Hail Kothadiyaji! Hail Chandran Pillaji! Hail Lakshman Sena! My dear people, The fireworks are about to begin. For your kind attention, no one should go towards that area. Before the fireworks begin, All India Lakshman Sena's constant companion, and the famous DJ Arun Singh Keshav will be presenting a brand new song. A brand new song in praise of Lakshman Sena... ...will be performed on this stage. Hail Lakshman Kothadiyaji..!! Hail Chandran Pillaji..!! Hail Lakshman Kothadiyaji..!!

My name is Anastasia Ober. -And I am the founder, initiator.. -Go and check on him. No. Ram will handle it. May you revel amongst relics. Isn't this our old white lady? So enjoy your stay... ... in the Accadio fun room. You caught hold of her too? Mythili! Mythili! -Switch on the lights, Mythili! -You schmuck! Mythili! Yes, it's back! Come on! Come! That's a great shot, Marakkar! Marakkar, damn it! Hey Ram! Nunchaku and Karate are not meant for you! The 'Mohiniyattam' dance suits you best! You idiot! Be careful. You will hurt yourself with it. I just told you, right? Abdu, let him go! Enough! Ram, no! Let go of me! Ram, that's enough. Abdu! Ram, stop it! Abdu, let him go! You.... You will shoot Gandhiji? Will you? Potty, stop them! Hey Potty! Come and hold the gun! Abdu, let him go! Abdu! Abdu! Abdullah, let go of him! Please stop! Ram! Ram! -Move away, Mythili Devi. -Ram, no! Ram! Don't hit him, Ram! Ram, stop! You bloody dog! If we snatched away your father's property, that's because of his incapability. If he shot himself dead, that's his foolishness! I am both the Judge and the Jury here! Enough, Ram! Ram! This is the verdict. The finale! The real Death Penalty. Death... for me. Penalty... for you. Ram! Ram, check if he's still alive. He's dead. Abdu! Abdu! Abdu! Abdu! You killed him? He... He was going to... Ram... It's Kalyan. Talk to him. -Kalyan... -Bro, what do I say! That braggart DGP made a lightning visit to the Commissioner's office. A new Commissioner has taken charge. A new posting. A hot-headed a*****e. And on top of all this, there's a mess of a meeting as well. I got free only now. I'll go home, change my clothes and come there quickly. Okay? Hey! The resort must be stunning after your renovation, right? I need to see it fully once I get there. I'll be there soon. And one more thing. Though you offered us 20% of the profit, my father and myself have only received Rs. 1.5 Million from you till date, ever since the deal was closed. So when I come there tonight, give me Rs. 20 Million in cash first, and settle all the old accounts. You can show your hospitality after that. Got it? Kalyan sir. He is their stooge here. He's putting on this dumb act, though he's aware of everything. I know, I know. Sir, when this Covid situation is prevailing, we should not be allowing... ...a meeting of this scale, under any circumstance. -We can't even insist them to wear masks. -You tell me then. What should I do? Should I do a Lathi charge? If I upset them, they will brand me an anti-National. If I upset them, they will brand me a Sanghi or a Muslim extremist. The police department lost its honour and power long back! Even if we want to take action, there will be a Lathi charge against us on social media tomorrow. After a glaring gap of five years, have they both come to reinstate their Kerala business empire! The Accadio South East Asia power couple, Ramkumar and Mythili. Please accept this hearty welcome from your humble partner and Kerala Police. Please accept this bouquet. That crappy car lying outside? Whose is it? Brahmand Solutions? What happened? Any sentimental attachment? Something has happened. Something terrible has happened. Do you know how he got here? Did he have a vehicle? I'm asking you. No... but we had met him in the city. And? And he enquired about Ram to us. But we avoided him without giving him an answer. Where all are the CCTV cameras installed here? I need its footage. If you have that, we can call this an intrusion and claim that the murder was in self-defense. Where is the server? It hasn't been installed. Great! World's greatest luxury chain! Great! Did he have a phone? Ram, it might be in the fun room. Mythili, go and check there. Prabha, you go there. Go! Mythili, over there. Found it! Found his phone! Here! Mythili, he found the phone. Come. -Here you go. -Hey Potty! You're quite impressive. Covering it in a handkerchief? Well, I have seen it in movies. Nice! Hey Ram! I found this under the sofa. Keep this safe. Okay. Ram! Search his pockets. What's that paper? It's the bill from a bar. Potty.... What's that? Nexito. Anti-depressant. Give it to Potty. Check his back-pockets. Give it to Potty. Pack all of it together, and keep it there. Mythili! Get me the bouquet I brought. Ram! Take out a flower from the bouquet. Come on, do it. You have killed him anyway. Before taking the next step, confess all the sins... ...that you and your father committed towards Abdu and his family, and place that rose flower on his chest. What about your father? That's not relevant now. This was really too much! Though it's you who killed him, it is he who has really won. How? I'll tell you later. Place that flower there, first. Keep it. The Abdullah Marakkar that I know... ... might be capable of all this rampage. But what you did to him now... he wouldn't have ever done the same to you. I'm sure about that. Hey Kalyan! Save me! Help me! Help us! I will. I'll manage this. But I will have to engage the entire state machinery under me, for this. And it will be really... really, really expensive. First, some hard cash. And later on, the expenditure to maintain the status quo of this crime in the future. I'll tell you very frankly. This... ... is going to be a lifelong regular entry in your balance-sheet. Now, did you understand how he won? When you kill the powerless, they win the war with their very own death. Can you please spare the rhetoric? How much will it cost? Tell me that. 8 Crores. 8 Crores? What the...!! Are you blackmailing me? How dare you, you snake? You forgot one thing. You're also a partner in this. For everything that happened in this property, you are also responsible. This is a property registered in the name of Vikraman Nair, and his heir Ramkumar Nair. As per the deal with Accadio Saket, Advocate Krishna Menon and his son Kalyan Menon, will have a share in the profits from this business. Anything that happens within the privacy of this property, be it debauchery or murder, its complete responsibility... will solely be upon Accadio's South-East Asia head Ramkumar, and quality control head Mythili Ramkumar. Moreover, you just grabbed the collar of... .. a Police DIG with high political affluence. So if you want to see yourself out of this... the initial sum will be, 8 Crores! Ram! You have half an hour to take a decision. Do you want to go to jail... .. or do you want all this back? Come with me. Just a second. Bro... Though I keep bluffing unnecessarily... to make my business flourish, the truth is that... ... my financial situation is not so great, unlike what you think. Did you see all these broken relics? All are duplicate items. It's just for show-off. Oh! Why didn't you tell this to me all this while? Well, I'm also supposed to be a silent partner in all this, right? Kalyan! Only this 8 acres, and this building which is mine, as well as yours. I only have this 'Saket' property with me. -What I make from.. -Hey! Hey! Stop it! What did you call me earlier? A snake, right? Indeed, I am a venomous snake. But... there's that proverbial snake, that bites the one struck by lightning. I'm not that type. Got it? Okay. Since you have requested so much, I can reduce half a Crore. So, it's 7.5 Crores. No more bargaining. This is final. And you don't have to give me anything hereafter, in the name of this silent partnership. Okay? Aren't you happy, bro? This is all I can do! Hey! In this situation, if I have to raise even a penny more than three Crores, I need to beg the loan shark Marwadi. I'll be ruined paying those extremely high interests. Please! So, the 116 resorts around the world which you used to talk about, so far? It was all bluff, brother! Total bluff! Ram! One minute. Go! Go ahead! Bloody opportunistic dog! What will we do? Let's just agree to his conditions. We don't have a choice. I'm sorry. Let's go deal with him. Childhood friend! What's all this, dude? It's his handiwork. We are ready. Don't misunderstand me, Mythili. I won't take even a single Rupee from what you're giving me. That is to destroy all the evidence in this case, and to maintain the status quo for ages. To the last shilling of it. -Are you okay? -Yes. Ram, just a minute. -I have to tell you something. -What? Potty! In between this? It's really urgent. That's why. -5 minutes. Come back quickly. -That's fine. Ram, come! Prabha, you also come. Mythili... There was a servant here, right? Yes. There's a watchman. He has gone to listen to that Kothadiya's speech. He'll come back only in the afternoon. Is he from this area? No. He came from Thane. Oh, yes. Praveen Kumar or Singh? Pawanputra Bhede. Yeah! Bhede! Do you have his documents with you? I have copies of his passport and Aadhaar card. Good. Bring it. Okay. Mythili! You said he fired the gun twice, right? Where all did the bullets strike? I have to recover the bullet cases. One hit the box with Gandhiji's spectacles. Another one hit the box which had Safdar Hashmi's pen in it. Both bullets have struck at politically incorrect places. What is it? Huh? Where are you going? Stay there. You stand here. You ******! You and her were fooling around on WhatsApp and Insta for the past two years, huh? You scoundrel! Once, when Sudama came to his friend Lord Krishna asking for help, the Lord did greatly help his friend. But in return, He didn't ask for Sudama's wife! Even though you are named Ram, you are still that old Nair's son, right? Ramkumar Nair! Leave that. If Kalyan has promised to solve this, he will do it. I'm sure about that. He is that Advocate's son, right? But... if this Sudama intends to, he can turn this game on its head, right away. Hey! You have only one way. Like him, make me also... ... a Kubera! What do you mean? 5 Crores! 5 Crores? Dude! Even Amitabh Bachchan gives away 5 Crores to 3rd runners up in KBC. So don't tell me that. It's not such a huge sum in today's age. Brahmand Solutions! All debts cleared! CEO, Parameshwaran Potty. P-O-T-T-Y. And... I got a call earlier, right? I had told him then, that I had come to meet Ramkumar at Vadakara. So, don't think that you can get rid of me. Got it? 5 Crores! Bank transfer. I have nothing to lose. Go. Go downstairs. Hey Ram! Free lunch, huh? Bloody dog! Go! So, it was you who called Abdu here? This condition is called, floccinaucinihilipilification. Shashi... Tharoor! Is the speed-boat lying outside yours? -Yes, it's mine. -We'll need it. Prabha... Get me the overcoats and hats of Hitler and Mussolini. Mythili, this place should be clean when we come back. Not a speck of this mess should remain. Potty, watch whether someone is coming from outside. -Lock the gate from inside. -Okay. Ram! Take this dagger, and that piece of stone. Bring them both. What for? Just do as I say! The beach has good visibility even at night. Even the sea is not 100% safe. The beam from the lighthouse is an issue. Get up. Take that dagger. Jhansi Rani's dagger. I won't touch the body. Just do as I say. Got me? What? I get dizzy when I see blood. I'll faint. Deja vu moment. Nair, if people without a conscience, start acting like they have conscience, it will not only be difficult for them, but also for the others who are trying to help them out. So, stop this acting first. Come here. Come on! Sit down. Sit down. What are you waiting for? Cut him open. Come on! From the side... Do it properly! Cut through the sides. Open him up properly. Open it. Put that stone inside his stomach. Keep it inside. Now tie it up with the cloth. Tighten it on that side. Get up. Throw the body into the water. Go ahead. Come on! Now we have to leave this Hitler & Mussolini in the sea. Don't leave any trace. Why are you crying like this, you loser? You've joined the club of celebrated murderers now. Be proud! That's your only option. There won't be any problem, right? Will he come back? Usually the body comes back on the third day, right? Nothing like that. Marakkar is supposed to be the Lion of Arabian Sea, right? The lions of the sea, will be taken by the sea herself. Come. So, as I said... When will you leave? We'll leave immediately. Ram, come. When are you leaving? Day after. My tickets are booked for that day. Don't skip that. Before you reach the airport, that transfer I asked for, should happen. To the UAE Hinduja bank account of my wife, you will deposit money from your Swiss Bank account. Then, it will be transferred to my wife's NRI account in some godforsaken bank here, from where I'll withdraw it. Just a trick from your own book. And... don't try to act smart with me. An extradition from the UK, is not so difficult anymore. Come here, all of you. Now, relax. Don't worry. If I say that I'll manage it, I'll do it. You know, right? Shall I leave? Hail Lord Ram! What happened on your face, sir? It's nothing. It was a superb speech by Lakshman Kothadiyaji, Madam. Why are you back so early? Didn't you say that you'll come only by afternoon? Didn't you go to your uncle's house? I went there, Madam. I had a blast with my friends. I got drunk last night. I had a lot of fun. So much fun at night. There was a party happening here last night, right sir? Okay. Go and clean the garden. One more thing, sir. While I was sleeping on the beach last night, I saw two people going to the sea on our boat. Since I was really drunk, I fell asleep over there. I thought I'll go and check in the morning. Then? But... in the morning... I woke up in the morning, hearing a ruckus. When I looked, some people and the police had crowded on the beach. When I went forward to get a closer look, I saw someone's chopped off hand. -Sir, someone is here to see you. -Who? Who are you? Sir wants to know. Tell him that I'm his friend. He knows me. Sir, he's saying that he's your friend. -Send him in. -Okay. You may go in. Has anyone here seen this tattooed hand earlier? -Have you? -But I didn't tell them anything, sir. At night, our boat was on that side. But when I checked now in the morning, it's on this side. When I checked inside the boat to find where it went at night, I found this, sir. There's something written in Malayalam in this. The moon was shattered, And moonlight, erased... Didn't someone come to meet you last night, sir? Who is he? I know everything! But I won't tell anyone anything, sir. He was a Turk, right? Bloody Pakistani! He deserved to die! But I have a small request. My mother is not well at all. She is bedridden. I haven't been able to go to my hometown for two years. For her treatment, I need some money. Very little. For the hospital expenses. How much? 50,000. 50,000 Rupees. We will give it. Every month. Every month, 50,000 Rupees! In cash. When you kill the powerless, they win the war with their very own death. Hail Lord Ram! 'THEERPPU' The Settlement Hello? Cantonment police station! Hello? I had called earlier. What's the matter? A man-missing case, in Vadakara. I've already registered a complaint. I wanted to know about that. Madam, say the name. I am Dr. Shwetha. Dr. Shwetha... Not that! Say the name of the missing person! Abdullah. Abdullah Marakkar. âª Where History once slept and rose in peace.., âª âª Recent wrongs have castled up. âª âª Old wounds fester here, now, âª âª By the salty waves of the sea of sin..; âª âª On this night.., âª âª Thisâ¦ very night! âª âª If happenstanceâ¦ joins hands with destiny.., here, âª âª Itâs Apocalypseâ¦! âª âª That blood-stained finale, âª âª itâd be unimaginable! âª âª Suchâ¦ is the swelling surge of the past.., âª âª The battle song of Karma! âª âª The end of story? âª âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª
