If I have to write you up... for inappropriate hair height one more time... you will be removed to detention. Miss Wimsey, what am I supposed to do? Hair can't just hang there like a dead thing on your cheeks. I mean, well... you know what I mean. I... As I said, it is not Mount Everest. Now, next week we will be talking... about earthquakes and volcanoes. And as exciting as that might sound... we have to look back approximately 60 million years. Now, if you turn your pages... we are going to start with the Ring of Fire. I want you to contemplate what causes... the separation of the two components. Penny, come on, hurry. Outta my way. Push. We're late. - One minute to air. - Ok. 40 to go. Don't change that channel. Coming up next. The Corny Collins Show. 30 seconds. - Hiya, Dad. - Goodbye. Hi. It's my daughter. 10 seconds.

Edna, is my laundry ready? Yep. That'll be $3.00, hon. That's pretty pricey for a pair of petty pants. Well, I'm sorry, Prudy... but some of your personal stains... required pounding with a rock. I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You're letting her listen to that race music again? My daughter spends every afternoon at the Stamp and Coin Club. Oh, really? Well, your daughter hap... Oh, what is that? The Waving Raven? It's a little twitchy. Oh, you wanna play Charades now. All right. Ok, go ahead. You. Penny. No. Tracy Turnblad, are you trying to tell me... that... that Penny didn't get permission... from her mother to be here? What? Penny. You are banned from this house. You will never watch that show again. Without that show I have nothing. Having nothing builds character. Toodle-oo, Edna. Give 'em a hand, folks. All right, all right. And, once again, that's the Stricken Chicken. We will be right back for some more of that hot Detroit sound. And we're off. Corny. "Detroit sound"? What's that, the cries of people being mugged? Aw, Velma, the kids dig the rhythm and blues. Yeah, they're kids, Corny. That's why we have to steer them in the white direction. Right direction? Didn't I say that? I'll do it. You try that again and there'll be stumps where your feet should be. You got that? You little whore... Amber. Holy moly. Baby. Good job dancing today. - It's time. - Ah. Link. Amber. Ah. - Amber. - Amber, Amber, Amber. Save your personal life for the cameras, sweetie. Oh. Shiny. Tammy, Lou Ann, you're gonna die. Speaking of cameras, did you have a nice nap? If you'd do your job, my daughter wouldn't have to fight to be visible. I gotta show some of the other kids once in a while. You know, this is a small city. There aren't that many stations. This time next year you could be wearing... an ill-fitting tux, snapping bar mitzvah photos. I don't know. ♪ It takes two, baby ♪ Show Link. This is nuts. She can't even dance. Plastic little spastic. Oh, Link. I can dance so much better than her. Why don't you notice me at school? ♪ Ooh ♪ Hey, that was our very own Link Larkin singing It Takes Two. And I'm Motormouth Maybelle reminding... the last Tuesday of this month's your rhythm and blues day. That's right. Negro Day will be coming your way. So don't... Over here. Thank you. So, catch all the crooning when you all set and tune in. Thank you, Motormouth. And now it's time to... Owner's coming. He'll call my mother again, let's go. Very own fun-loving... Hey. Come on up here, Brenda. What? Brenda will be taking a leave of absence from the show. How long you gonna be gone, Brenda? Just nine months. Seems like we'll have an opening here on the show for a girl... just as fun-loving but maybe not quite as freewheeling. Wanna be one of the nicest kids in town? Cut school tomorrow and come down to station WYZT to audition. - No. - But, Ma. Don't test me, Tracy Turnblad. My diet pill's wearing off. But come on. No one is auditioning for anything in this household. But why not? Why not? Because dancing is not your future. One day you're gonna own Edna's Occidental Laundry. I don't wanna be a laundress. I wanna be famous. Look, if you wanna be famous... learn how to take blood outta car upholstery. That's a skill you can take right to the bank. Hey, hey. What's all this ruckus in here? Not a word. Daddy, tomorrow I'm auditioning to dance on a TV show. - No, she is not. - You are? First the hair, now this? But all the kids are batting up their hair now, hon. You're no help. It's "ratting," Daddy. And our first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, does it. I don't believe that. What do you mean, you don't believe that? - I don't. - How else would it look that way? I believe that it is naturally stiff. She doesn't understand anything. Dancing on that show is my dream. I know. Just because she wouldn't know a dream if it bit her on the nose. Well, I have information for you, Missy. I once had a dream that I owned a coin-operated laundromat... and I came down from that cloud real quickly, I'll tell you that. No. - Oh, Wilbur. - Fine. I'm going to my room. She thinks I'm being mean but I'm not. Those TV people... they don't pick people like Tracy, or girls like us. They're gonna hurt her, Wilbur. I'll talk to her. Ooh. Ok. Talk to her. I'll talk to her. Don't you worry. Ok. What? Tracy, this TV thing. You really want it? With all my heart. Then you go for it. This is America, babe. You gotta think big to be big. Big ain't the problem in this family, Wilbur. You follow your dream. Mine came true, and now I have the most precious thing in the world. The Taj Mahal of joke shops. Heh heh heh heh.

Oh, Wilbur, to think that I almost stopped her... from reaching for the stars. And now here she is on local daytime TV. She's gonna be a regular. Imagine, my little girl, regular at last. I also hope to be the first woman president or a Rockette. And if you were president, Tracy... what would your first official act be? I'd make every day Negro Day. I read you like tomorrow's headlines, Tracy. What do you think, kids? You think we might have a hot new candidate... for Miss Teenage Hairspray? That's only the dream of my life. But Miss Hairspray is mine. We're on the air. And your dream will be coming to you, sweetheart... Saturday, June 2nd, right here on WYZT. You have to vote for a person, Corny, not one of the Himalayas. Hi, Penny. Always the charmer, Amber. I want that chubby communist girl off the show. Well, let me be the first to toss the harpoon. She's a corrupting influence. I agree. We don't want our dancers thrusting like savages. Hey, speak for yourself. Don't get flip with me. I'm not. Look, now I got some new ideas for the show. First, we get rid of "A Negro Day." Finally, some sense outta you. And we mix those kids in with the rest of "The Council." Mix those kids? That's right, I said it. This is not a black-and-tan cocktail. Well, why couldn't it be? Velma, isn't this where it's all heading anyway? Now, you can fight it or you can rock out to it. Maybe it is time for some fresh ideas... like... like a nice, fresh new host. Heh. Gee, Velma, how do you fire Corny Collins... from The Corny Collins Show? They do it all the time on Lassie.

Mrs. Von Tussle is the station's manager. Oh, the station manager. Oh. Oh, it was so nice of you let her on that show. Well, Tracy certainly has... redefined our standards. Ha ha. That's for sure. Let me guess... brand-new dress? Oh, yes. Well, you'll stop traffic. Ha ha ha. It was nice meeting you. Tracy. Bye, Tracy. Ma, don't listen to a word she says. I'm taking this back. Don't you dare. - I am. - Don't you dare. Don't you know why she hates us? She's afraid I'll beat Amber for Miss Teenage Hairspray. Really? They can't put Tracy in special Ed. I won't have it. I mean, even if I have to tutor her myself... they cannot hold my friend back. - You're a saint. - Mm. Oh, and it's totally not true about her and the entire football team. I mean, please. Anybody can get grass stains all over their back. Amber, stop it. I'm sick of you doing that. Just because she's a good dancer. I'm sorry. You think that she can dance? Well, maybe you'd rather have her as your partner. You could get sponsored by Goodyear. Excuse me. What is going on back there? Tracy, that's horrible. Mr. Flak does not have breasts. What? No. I would... I would never. What... Oh. Oh, and Mr. Larkin, perhaps you'd like to share... with the rest of the class Patrick Henry's immortal last words. "Kiss my ass"? You didn't have to do that, Link. Hey, no prob. Besides, looks like a cool scene down here. Right. Hey, cool. Hey, Tracy. Not quite, huh? Ah, damn. Just when I was getting it. Listen, man, you ain't gotta stop now. My mum's having a platter party tonight. You all wanna come check it out? Now? Would you mind if I, too, checked it out? I've never been to North Avenue before.

Shall we dance? Come on. My name is Mike. Mike? Yes, Mike. Mike who? It's Mike. Anyway, ahem...

Ooh, we get any more white people in here... this gonna be a suburb. Do you know what I had to pay a cab... just to consider coming down here? Oh, Mum... No call. You just disappear. And all mashed up against a crooner? Edna Turnblad, this is Link. Come on, we're going. And, Penny, go home before your mother shoots you. Miss Edna, is it?

Tempting but, no, thanks. - Ha ha ha. - Oh. Well. What can I do you for? Something for the mister? Sadly, there is no mister at the moment. Beautiful woman like yourself? My husband... accidentally suffocated. You need a fella. I do. I do need a fella. And the way to a man's heart is through his funny bone. Now here's an icebreaker for ya. Oh, Miss Maybelle, you do throw a lovely party. But what are you celebrating? Well, it's kind of an ending. But it deserved to go out with a bang. What ended? Negro Day. What? All right. Time you all knew. Velma Von Tussle just told me we have had our last show. No. Yeah, it seems our little show was a nice little placeholder... but it was time to get some ratings. Aww. I didn't wanna tell you all up front. I just wanted to have a little fun tonight. But I practised so hard. Now I'll never get a chance to be on the show. Oh, you will be seen, baby. I promise. You can't have your own show? Fine, you'll come dance with us. Honey. You been dozing off during history? Yes, always. Trace, black and whites ain't never danced on TV together. Well, if we can't dance... maybe we should just march. Ooh, that'd get some big old rating's. Better time slot, too. Like on the 11:00 news. What you all say? Should we give this fine woman... all the ratings she deserves? - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, hey. Well, it is a school night... and I think we oughta call it a night. Tell you what. We meet up at the church Friday, 4:00... and we will march on WYZT. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Tracy, you can't protest, hon. I mean, these are lovely people... but if you protest, you'll be on lists. You'll be on files. J. Edgar Hoover'll be still wiretapping... your cold, dead body in the grave. Oh, Mother. Link, we're going with them, right? Walk with me. You want your Belgian chocolate animal droppings. Dot dot. This store's for you. - Oh. What a treasure trove. - Huh? Come here, baby. Don't be sad. We gonna make it happen, ok? Can I go? Now, come on, now. I can't be worried about you out there. Trace... I been smiling and dancing on this show for 3 years. Mrs. Von Tussle just promised... I could sing at the Miss Hairspray pageant. She's... she invited agents. That's my shot, Trace. I can't jeopardise that. But it's what's right. I'm sorry, Trace. I just think this adventure's... a little... too big for me. Oh, God. No, no, no. That's not what I... I get it, Link. It's your shot. No, Trace, that's not what I... It's fine. Oh, hon. I should go. Give him time. He'll figure out he's crazy about you. You have to say that, you're my mother. Well, I know a little something about men. And, my personal favourite, x-ray specs. You can see through anything. Skin, clothes, you name it. Now, take your father. And he's always downstairs in that shop working late. Do I take it personal? No. Men always put their career first. Remember that. Ok. I'm really tired, I'm gonna go to bed. All right, hon. Night. - I love you. - I love you, too. I think I'm gonna go to bed, too. Oh, I'm so tired. You don't need those... to see what's under these clothes. There's a product that really works... because these are phony as a three dollar bill. Incredible. I could do a fan dance with a lettuce leaf... and you would remain completely obtuse. Obtuse.

Oh. Oh. Daddy, are you ok? Tracy, you know... these peepers have never looked at another woman. This heart only beats for size 60. Daddy, you know what Velma wanted. She wanted me off the show. And I knew that, but how could she go that far? Come here. Come here, little girl. Little girl. And then to just cancel Negro Day like that. Just to make sure that nobody who's different... or who's black or Chinese... or maybe who needs to lose a few pounds. What are you talking? Stop it. What are you talking? I think I've been in a bubble or something. Thinking that fairness was just going to happen. It's not. I think people like me are gonna have to get up... off their father's laps and go out there and fight for it. Your mother and I... We don't see too far past our front door. But you... see all the way to Schenectady. So, if there's something you need to stand up for... don't ya listen to old dogs like us. We need to learn some new tricks... from you. You don't need new tricks, Dad. You need Mum. She changed the locks. Oh. Good night, Daddy. Aw, wow. Come on, baby. Honey, took me 5 years... to figure out you were flirting. How could I ever?

Now I really think they don't need you anymore. You come home with me. Oh. No, we are not sending a camera crew. They're protesting our own station, dimwit. Why is Channel Five there? Well, of course they're all Negroes. And why would...? I know who would. Oh, I know exactly who would. 2, 4, 6, 8. TV's got to integrate. 2, 4, 6, 8. TV's got to integrate. 2, 4, 6, 8. Oh, my God, no. TV's got to integrate. - No. - Ma, come on. The sound's not working. You knew there'd be police. But I didn't know there'd be cameras. So? Oh, I cannot be seen on television at this present weight. 2, 4, 6, 8. TV's got to integrate. 2, 4, 6, 8. TV's got to integrate. 2, 4, 6, 8. TV's got to integrate. Excuse me. Is there some reason we can't pass by peacefully? I strongly suggest you and your little friends... head back to where you come from. Hey, you don't have to be so rude. Tracy. It's all right, Tracy. I can handle this. Excuse me. She was talking to you. - Oh, Tracy. - Oh. Tracy, no. You just assaulted a police officer, miss. - No. - I what? Assaulted? Enough. Hey. All right, boys. Let's take the whole lot in. - No. - Run, Tracy. Run. 2, 4, 6, 8. TV's got to integrate. 2, 4, 6, 8. TV's got to integrate. 2, 4, 6, 8. TV's got to integrate. 2, 4, 6, 8. TV's got to integrate. And our cameras also caught Tracy Turnblad... the teenage TV personality and rabble-rouser. Miss Turnblad brutally attacked a sergeant... with a blunt instrument before fleeing the scene... You see? You see? If I let you leave the house... right now you'd be in prison fighting whores for cigarettes. That Tracy Turnblad always was a bad influence. Well, you are never, ever gonna see that beehived harlot again. Ok, Mother. Excuse me. Penny? Pray for her. She's gonna need it. Tracy. Tracy. She's not here, I told you. Hon, she knows... if the cops are looking for her... this is the first place they'll come. What this must of put you through, Wilbur. I'm so sorry. I'm not. You're not? I'm proud of you. You are? Baby, somebody had to do something. Course, we may be eating beans for the next 10 years. Bail for 20's kind of pricey. You bailed all those people out? Ya upset with me? I'm sorry. Hon, it just seemed like the right thing. Oh, Wilbur, it was the right thing. Knights in armour don't come any shinier than you. But where's our little girl? Are you ok, Trace? Oh, you have no idea. Come on. Thank you so much. You're such a great friend. Thanks. Penny, the cops are looking for me everywhere. You could go to jail for helping me. Tracy, I'm already in jail. Come on. Oh, no. - What? - Your hair deflated. Oh, let it. It was just a symbol of my conformity to the man. You are so tough. So, what do ya think? Maybe you could live down here. I don't even know why we have this room down here... but there's food, water... first aid kit, gas mask, Russian-language books. It's very well-insulated. It won't be where you're going. The police are on their way. Mum, please don't send my best friend to the big house. Penny, hush. You haven't heard the last of me, Mrs. Pingleton. Things need to change... and I won't stop trying to change them. I don't care how long it takes. Good, you'll be waiting 20 to life. Get the jump rope, Penny. Mum, not the jump rope. Don't you touch my canned tuna. You wait till your father gets out of prison. You'll see more than a jump rope, Missy. A massive manhunt is underway for Miss Turnblad... who bludgeoned sergeant and decorated Korean war veteran... Mike Morris with a crowbar, shattering his jaw... That is a lie. They're talking about our baby, Wilbur. They're telling lies. Sergeant Morris is in critical condition. This is such a Midol moment. Wilbur, that... Oh. Maybe that's her. Oh, that's her. Is that you, Tracy? Oh, Link. I thought you'd be Tracy. No. I was just at home... practising my new twist on the twist... and I overheard it on the news. I can't believe Tracy savagely bludgeoned an Eagle Scout. That's just not like her. Well, it's not true, I was there. He didn't even bleed. I shoulda been there... beside her. I can't sleep, I can't eat. You can't eat? Well, come on in and worry with us. I'll make you some pork. Penny Lou Pingleton, you are absolutely... positively, permanently punished. You will live on a diet of saltines and Tang... and you will never leave this room again. Devil child. Devil child. Seaweed. Don't let her hear you. Penny, what happened to you?
