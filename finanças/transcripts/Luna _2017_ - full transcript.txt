It's BAM 31. So where's Panpan? You know, the little white rabbit, Bambi's friend. Where is he? Did you see him? -Mind your own shit. -Don't get mad. Bambi. He's a painter. A house painter.

Are you all children or what? You're right, Bambi. Here's your phone. Take it. Place it on the table. You want me to place it? I'm placing your phone. Look, right here, bro. Are you serious?

Get lost. -Did you have organic wine? -Jerk. Hello? Now you remember me? Don't try to sweet-talk your way out of it like Ruben, please. I didn't hear you. Oh well, it's OK. What? Hold on. Hold on. Sorry about what happened. You know, I got my diploma. -Really? -Yes. And I wanted to thank you. It's thanks to you. Once you've sobered up, we'll talk about this fall. I maybe wanted to hire you. You want to hire me? Me? If you stop throwing up on me, why not? Hello, Chloe. You know what? My boss wants to hire me. It's crazy, right? Oh yes, it's awesome. Even though I threw up on his boots this morning. Come on, stop it. You're annoying. As if each time a guy gets stripped, he goes to the police. We were wasted. Your parties seem nice. Invite me next time. Did you see that? 'Till Wednesday. -On time. -Yes. Don't worry. No, my abortion's on Wednesday. Oh no, are you serious? Fuck, I completely forgot. You're annoying. Mom. Mom? What time is my abortion on Wednesday? Yell louder. I don't think they heard you. Will it be over by four or no? It's for the contest. Girls, it's an operation under general anesthesia. But Mom, can we put it off or not? -Please ma'am, it's important. -Please. See. Don't worry. We've got the weekend too. If we fail, we won't have the time to do it again. We won't fail. It'll be great because you're really talented. Kisses, sister. Luna? -Luna? -What? I'm not cleaning up after your dog. Find him a box or something. I'm coming. It's going to be hard in the dark. Sorry, I messed up. -Is it for me? -No. It's for all the white hair I got this year because of you. Of course not. It's for your diploma, silly. Really? Of course, put your box down. Did you have fun last night? Not really. Same for me. He didn't even come. Shit, which one? The fat one? No, the handsome one. To our lousy evenings. Look. Man, you filmed it? How's it going? Hey, princess. -Is that Ruben? -Yes, it's Ruben. They've been at it for a while now. Hey Ruben, you went nuts. Come on, stop jerking off to it. Are you crazy? It's all good. Delete it from your phones. Seriously. Hey, beautiful. -What are you doing? -I'm showing him the video. Why to just anyone? Not just anyone. He's our buddy, Gillou. I don't care if it's Gillou. Give me that. What are you doing? Don't delete it. You're fucking annoying. He deleted it. Wait, where are you going? To work. And your dog? I can't take him. I'm going to work. If you don't want him, I'll sell him. He's expensive. I love your gift, but I have to go to work now, all right? I'll stop by tomorrow. Tomorrow, I won't be home. Why, where are you going? Oh yes, fuck. I'll be there. You won't be alone. OK? Luna? Are you OK? Are you sure? Hello. Luna. Please open. Luna. Hi, beautiful. I'm sorry that I couldn't come yesterday because I had to replace someone at work, so I was stuck there. And a text message? My battery was out. I feel guilty, I swear. The "I swear's", the excuses don't work anymore. You did have to wait all alone at the parking lot. You wanted flowers? -Just go. -Stop. Don't touch me, Ruben. Princess, I'm here now. Look at me. Stop. I can't now. It's bleeding because of the abortion. It hurts a bit too. Next week, it'll be better. OK. Finish me off then. I don't know. Right now? It won't be long. Wait, are you leaving? Yes, I'm going to show him off to my cousin. Have you got a leash or something? Behind you. I'll buy you a real leash, a real collar. Keep in touch. Sensually, yes. Show that leg. You're doing good. You're good. Come on, look at me. There. The chin, the shoulders. Yes, great. Keep the look. Keep the look. Yes, great. Lean towards me. Still looking at me. Don't turn away. The look of love. Caress the car. Love the car. Really love it. Turn around, go. Your hand on your butt. The butt in the air. Super. Great. I love it, turn around. OK, there. You take the car. It's your car. It's your car, Luna. OK. You love it. Sir, you're showing. What's your art school called? International School of Arts. It's really well known in the States. In Montpellier? Yes, we have a branch. OK, but shouldn't you have a certificate from this school? Actually, we're done here. We're leaving. Yes, we've got what we need. We just started, Chloe. Come on, Luna. Come on, let's go. Thank you, sir. Goodbye. Honk yourself! Hello. Hi Chloe, how are you? Very good. -Luna's not with you? -Yes, she is. Wait a minute. -Tell me it's a wig. -No. Did you do that? Mom, we made photos for her portfolio. If we win, we're going to model in Paris. And if we win again, I'll get into Studio Mode. What's that? It's a well-known and expensive fashion design school. OK, take this, and you go change. And then help your friend set the table. Even though I told him, he couldn't care less. He sits down in front of me and goes, "Yeah, finish me off." What would you have done? I would have finished him off. Yeah, with a kick in his balls. Hold on, did you do it? Are you crazy? I'm not his whore. Come on. What are we doing today? Beans. -Sorry, I got lost on the way. -Get in. You were almost late. Sorry. What's your name? Alex. -I'm Christine. -Thomas. Where are you going? Go ahead, I'll catch up. What are you doing? We'll be way over there. I have to go. -What? -I'm sorry. What's going on? Are you're sick? No, no. Then you work. It's not a free-for-all here! It's not that. I don't care about your drama. So if you're leaving, then go and don't come back. Don't try me. Excuse me, what do we do with the crates once we're done? You take them, and you put them over there, with the carts. OK, thanks. What did he say to you? Nothing, as if everything was OK. What did he do then? Did he leave? Yes, he left. He got on his scooter and left. He didn't even follow me. It's all right, guys. He didn't recognize you. He forgot. Even I didn't recognize you with your new haircut. Why is he at my job? I can't believe it. It's not by accident. Why not? It hurts when he looks at me. It doesn't matter. If he speaks, we'll give him a good beating. No, no, no. Don't show up at my job anymore. You already embarrassed me once. Quit your job. What? That way we don't run any risks. You're crazy. My boss just hired me, and you want me to quit my job? If he recognizes you, we're fucked. It's not about you! She wasn't alone with the guy. So why does she have to suffer alone? You've got a problem? Hello. -How are you? -Good, and you? -Hello. -Hello. Today, it's melons. Right away. Let's go. -We need to do eggplants too. -Yes, all right. Alex, have you worked with tomatoes? No. I'll show you. Very good. Come. Let's go. Take these. José. Cut off the secondary branches. Make sure they don't have any fruit. You've got fruit on this one, so don't cut it. You can cut this one. You have to cut the suckers too. Do you know what a sucker is? No. A sucker is a side shoot that grows between two branches. We cut it because it tires the plant out. There, do you understand? Yes, I think so. OK, go ahead then. -Is that all right? -Yes. Is that a sucker? How did you get this job? My father knows Sebastian. How do they know each other? He fixed his roof. I'm going to take care of the eggplants. Work to the end of the row. OK, thanks. -We're on break. -I'm coming. We're on break! -Are you coming? -Go ahead, I'll catch up. For a service, they got you. Sometimes he's at the bar. Who worked on the tomatoes this morning? I thought so. You've got shit in your eyes? You didn't see the fruit there? I was careful, I swear. What is it like when you're not careful then? What is that? What is that? Look at me when I'm speaking to you. I did as she told me. You told him? Yes, I even took 15 minutes off my own work. You'll do melons with Christine this afternoon. Oh no, he'll slow me down. And did you do your Santa Claus drawing? -Yesterday. -How was it? Let's go. Where's Alex? I think he went home. That boy's a joke. -What are you doing with my dog? -Ruben's dog, no? Why are you walking him? If you want to walk him, go. Come here, buddy. Where are you going? Come here. Show me your teeth. Show me. Open your mouth. Open. Open your mouth, there. What's wrong with you? Stop it, Ruben. What? He's not a toy. Stop bugging him. Are you stupid? What's wrong, Oxmo? -Where is he going? -Oxmo! Oxmo! -Oh fuck. -Luna! -What are you doing? -Are you insane? She likes to swim at night. Help her instead of laughing at her. Go Luna. Go Luna. Are you serious? Come on, help me. You're having trouble. Take him. Come on, push. Are you OK? Here. Do a mouth to mouth too. Shut up. Don't touch me. How was the water? Come on, let's go. Luna, it was a joke. Shut up. He's yours. Have fun. I get 15 texts from her in the morning. But it's as small as that. Don't worry, she already knows you're lying. I'll walk you home? She ruined the party. They're not the right size. They won't sell. What is that? Look, that's a small one. That's a big one. You said small ones. Impossible! You can see they're not mature. It's stupid. That's how we pick them. No, never. You're staying and picking the good ones. I've got things to do this afternoon. No questions asked, you do as I say. And sleep better at night. Damn it. What are you doing? I'm helping you. It'll go faster. Not so sure. Maybe it could make you nicer too. I was only joking. The tomatoes falling off like that, that was also a joke? Are you accusing me? I don't want your stupid job. At the end of the month, I'm gone. Since you don't want me. What are you talking about? I didn't touch your tomatoes. And it's not a stupid job. OK. Need a ride? I'll wait for the bus. That's dumb. The next one is in an hour. Don't worry, I'm used to it. Used to what? To burn in the sun? But it's just like any other way of dying. Move on. Move on! What? I moved. Come on. Sit down. Can I leave you here? Yes, no problem. Thanks. See, you did it. Once per month. OK, later. Hello, is there a problem? I came to see your mother. No, I'm sorry. I wasn't feeling well this morning. Hi, I left you a note. There's some leftover lasagna. Heat it up. Later. OK, have a good evening. I saw your boyfriend from Vendargues this weekend. What's his name again? I left him a long time ago. Oh yeah? It's hard to follow you. Alex, the guy comes here on his 125-cc motorcycle, driving like a madman. Stop talking about my life. If he could, he would've shot us all. What was his name? -Rudy. -Shut up! You're the one who obsessed over him, and now we can't say his name? Shut up. If you're angry, you still like him. Stop! I don't like him. Stop it. You all can't take a joke? Is she laughing? Why did you choose agriculture? That's all I'm good at. That's not true. No, it's because I'm out in the fresh air. I need that. I can't imagine myself working in an office or in a store. Vegetables are cool. You don't need to suck up to them. I can't imagine you doing that either. You don't even say hello. Right. Do you have a light? You always bring it with you? No, we've been practicing a lot. The Fanfare Festival is coming up soon. You're going to play? Yeah. It's not certain yet because I missed a lot of sessions, so they're mad. They might find someone else. Why don't you go? It looks fun. I don't know. I haven't really been feeling it lately. Do you play music? Me? I played a recorder for half an hour in sixth grade, and the teacher banned me for the rest of the year. Anyways, I have no talent. Basically you're an annoying asshole without talent. It's all that I love. Is it OK? -Is this where you live? -Yes, over there. -It looks cool. -Yes, it's nice. I'm going to go. I'll call you. Where were you? I've been trying to reach you for an hour. Sorry. Did you get my text? No, it was on airplane mode. I didn't make it. Shit. Did they say why? I'm not even on the waiting list. Fucking assholes. They're missing out. I don't know. That means I'll be working with my mother at the hair salon. What am I going to do? I'm going to go crazy with her. Come here. Who are you texting? No-one. I swear, I'll drown you. Stop. Come here, I swear. Olé. Ah! Come here. Stop. -I've got something for you. -You're lying. Yes, it's true. You're making me tired. It's not working. Look. It's not working. Here. Look, hold it. Tighten your lips. Tighten your lips. It'll work, I'm certain. Tighten your lips and blow softly. Are you serious? It took me months to make that sound. Damn, you're talented. It's thanks to the recorder. I got the basics down. The donkeys love it. Definitely. The great trumpeter of the future. Here. Stop. Are you crazy or what? Sorry, I thought it was a bug. Are you a real redhead? No. What's your natural color? I don't really know anymore. Dirty blond. Do you have a photo? I was ugly before. You're lying. Come on! -The water's great. -I'm coming. Leave me alone! Just leave me! Alex? Alex? Alex? -Alex! -Let me go, leave me alone! Why are you lying? -Alex? -Bastard. No, stop Alex. Alex, stop. Let him go. I'll kill him! Alex, leave him. -I'll kill him! -Stop. -Stop. -Let me go! Stop it! What the hell is going on? I can't leave you alone -for 30 minutes. -It's him. He jumped on me, accusing me. What happened? Ask him. I didn't do anything. I was with the group. Yes, except for now. What did he do? Did he steal something? No, it happened before. -Before what? -In June. In June. That's impossible. We're from Perpignan. I'm their educator. We arrived here two days ago. He better shut up. Stop it. It's impossible. They had the same dog. That's the rec center's dog. I think you made a mistake. -Come on. -Let me go. I'm sorry about what happened. I completely lost it. I'm sorry. I'm not usually the violent type. I don't look for trouble. Alex, I can't be with you. -I'm sorry. -What? What? Wait. Wait, let me explain. There's nothing to explain. Two months ago, I was out tagging. Forget it. I stumbled across some drunk assholes. They had their way with me. Just like that, for no reason. There were ten of them. They hit me. They humiliated me. They went crazy. I couldn't stop them. Just now, when I saw the guy with his dog, I lost it. I'm sorry. I like you, you know. It's been weeks and weeks since I've felt so good. Give me a chance. I don't know. I'll come pick you up tomorrow night. I don't know. -Please, Luna. -Let me go. Alex. Alex! Why are you here? You play the trumpet now? It's not your problem. Go on, it's nice. What? Bambi, he's still working with you? No, I got him fired, I told you. Where is he now? I don't know. Why? Because he came to Vendargues three days ago. Marco told me. What did he do? I don't know, but he stayed for a long time. Maybe he was looking for someone? Do you know where he lives? No, I don't really care. Find me his address, all right? I'll put some pressure on him. Forget it. He didn't do anything. I never forget it. You know me. Unfortunately. I can't stop thinking about you. I miss you. Let me go. Don't cheat. Alex. Where are we? At the boss' place. I got his keys. He's gone for the weekend. We've got the house, the pool. We're good here. Do you still think about the assault? Why do you ask? Yes or no? It depends. You never went back? Where? To where it happened. I saw on TV once, that when we're traumatized by something, we often want to go back there. It's like getting exorcised. I'm not traumatized. Really? You never went back? Yes, once. Why? Seriously, don't go back. It can be dangerous. The more I'm with you, the less I think about it. I love you. You always walk around with condoms? For the last couple of days, yes. Alex? He has plenty of these. Put that away. You're crazy. It's not charged. Did you find it here? Let's go? I have to go to the pharmacy. I forgot something. Chloe, I swear I wanted to tell you. Is that a nice color? I didn't know how to say it. I think it's whorish. His name is Alex. He's a good guy. I don't want to lose him. Please, don't tell the others. Chloe, please. I don't owe you anything. Fuck off. You've been lying to me for weeks. Did you tell him what you did that evening? Of course. You're lying. For once, be responsible. -What? -Stop. What happened? Luna? -Leave me, please. -Stop. Wait. Where are you going? Luna. It always ends badly with me. What ends badly? -Have a nice weekend -You too. Close the stores behind me. What do we do? Go back to his pool? I was there. I was with the guys who jumped you. We were drunk. We were being stupid. What? Don't you recognize me? I had a different haircut before. I don't believe you. I was the one who pulled your pants down. I swear it was because of Ruben. I was ready to do anything for him. Alex, please. At least, let me explain. Don't touch me! Please, don't go like that. I'm sorry, I swear. Alex, please. Alex. Alex? Yes, of course. Why there? OK. Call him. Who? That guy. Ruben, I want him here. Why? I want him to apologize. He'll never come. How do you want him to come? Figure it out. Luna, if you want us to have another chance, call him. What are you doing? I don't see him anymore. It's useless. We're no longer friends. How could you lie to me like that? I thought you would forget it with time. How could you think that? Every night, I think of those assholes and of the girl who laughed. And then I thought of you, to try to forget. The second one is the real Luna. What happened to the first one? You think it's fine if we say it never happened? That she never existed? Let's leave. What if he comes with the others? Hey. I found them on my way here. For you. What's going on? Say you're sorry. What? He wants you to apologize. Hold on, you made me come for this? To make me look like a fool? Crazy bitch. Stop. What? You think you scare me with your cheap gun? OK, I'm sorry. Fuck, stop it, man, I said I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Put it down. He said sorry. I'm sorry, what do you want? Please stop. Put your gun down. Put your gun down! Fucking go. Alex. Alex. Go to hell! What are you doing? Waiting for the bus. Isn't the next one in an hour? I'm used to it. To burning in the sun?
