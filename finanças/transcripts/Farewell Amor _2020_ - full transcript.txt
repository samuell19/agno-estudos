Jeff Kennedy International Airport. You should not accept any transportation from anyone without prior arrangement. - Amorr, here you are. - My wife. Sylvia. Look at this, look at this. Turn around, let me see you. Wow, Silvia What do you think of New York? It's amazing. We would love to practice speak English more. Are you okay? Sylvia, aren't you excited? This is home, welcome. I need to use the bathroom. Oh yes. Let me show you. Esther, you and I will be sleeping down there. She does over there. And Sylvia, I have converted the living room for now. So you could have your own space. I'm looking for a bigger place that would be more suitable. Maybe it would be like all the American kids and get your own place. And not yet. First relieve us, the family as God intended it. Yes, of course. The bathroom is down there. The lights is on the walls to your left. I wish your mother could see this. Her boy learned how to cook. I hope you like it. Who taught you? I picked up some things here and there. Please eat before it gets cold. Let's pray first. We have a lot to be thankful for. Yes. Sorry. Jehovah Jirey, we praise your name the most high. Lord, thank you for bringing us together, after 17 years apart. We thank you for your endless blessings and love. We thank you for our home and our family. We thank you because the devil is shamed and defeated. We pray all these things in the Holy name of Jesus. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Yes. It's very soft. Tender. Americans don't like stew with their food. The doctor had recommended no fat meals. For years the only food I could eat was my mother's cookie. So when we got married, I forced your poor mama to learn how to cook all of my mama's dishes. Poor mama. She should have never put up with me. My pastor said we must focus on familiarizing ourselves in spirit and flesh in order to rebuild our family. Wait. What now, unattractive? No, you're not. Lying is a sin you know. That's not what I meant. I haven't been with any man since you left. Thank you, I mean, I'm sorry I wasn't there. I hope everything will be perfect. Seriously. Perhaps we should just get some rest, thanks. Ready for American school? Of course she is. She's going to study hard so she could get into medical school. With scholarship, the first doctor in the family, God willingly. What kind of medicine are you interested in? She wants the three children. I like mathematics. Really, like father this one. I keep telling you your father was always studying so many things. I need to see your back. Sorry sir, excuse me. Please step back sir I just need to check her back. I have this letter from school. Did you find any change in the city? I see you changed that picture. Yeah. They said a thing? Someone. I know that sex must be good. Whenever I go back home my wife is like she has something to prove. I can only imagine after what is it? Nine years? 17. Oh, she's supposed to be lucky that he was with the nurse as you'd be in jail for homicide. What, you know it's the truth, man. I don't wanna talk about it. My brother, all I'm saying to you man. you're not the only person who have ever been in this situation. Things happen, don't feel bad. I don't, everything is fine. Well, I guess I better start my shift. Have a good one. You too. Why are you here? What happened? I can't be seeing you more time. I need love too. Yes, and thanks. Hey, what's up, DJ pull up. I can't. Are you sure you can't? You're early today. I am. I swapped my shift so I could be home for dinner with the family at least once this week. Great So Vinner, clear your books, go set the table. So, how was school today? Fine. Is that how you respond? It was fine, thank you. She's so excited to finally be here with you. I'm not so sure about that. Nonsense, cautious. I was thinking maybe we should plan some things as a family so we could get to know each other. I've just been praying about this. - Yes. - Yes. Or perhaps this Sunday, we could go for a drive outside the city, maybe the jazzy show... Aren't we all going to church? I thought it would be good to leave the city early to avoid the traffic. Oh, that's fine. That's fine, perhaps there's a sunrise service we can attend. Of course I'll check. I brought home some wine, so we can toast. Alcohol? It's wine. But you know we're shouldn't drink. But is just a simple wine for a special occasion. ♪ I rejoice, that this' my choice ♪ ♪ To give my savior all my voice ♪ ♪ I rejoice ♪ ♪ Happy day, happy day ♪ ♪ when Jesus was my savior way ♪ Thank you Jesus. ♪ Everywhere I go ♪ As soon as my immigration paperwork is finalized, I'll get a job, so I can help with the bills. I can handle things for now. You got a lot on your plate to worry about. Thank you a lot. For what? Not giving up on us. Don't steal a plate. And, did you see the mail that your neighbor brought the other day? I don't know why it's hard for the mail man to put the mail in the correct box. Sylvia, Sylvia, are you okay? I'm fine. And why can't you move it? I can, I promise. I can't let you go to school like this. Broken up bone. I'm serious Sylvia. You're going to tell mama? Come on worry about mama later. She's still down in dialysis. So you're practicing for the dance there. Young man told us about your school. When you stopped waiting for my weekend phone calls, mama said because sneaking out to dance, that scared her. Do you think it scares her? She prays so much. You know I used to be quite a dancer as well when I was younger. It's true. It may be not that style dance. Your mother would make matching outfits with both of us and we'd go to the secret parties and dance all night long. Night? Yeah. No, we used to dance a lot before you were born. And even after, but you were too young to remember. And then what happened? The end of the war. Aging doctor pace bill to 3B. Doctor pace bill to 3B Sylvia Disantos. Wake up, let's go. Sylvia, let's go. Come. What brings you in today? She injured her hand. How did this injury take place? I fell. And when did the injury happen? Yesterday. Where does it hurt? Can you show me exactly? Anywhere else? It's only a little bruise, but nothing too unusual. The doctor is going to be right with you. Do you need anything? - Hi doc. - What do you want from me? You promised you would never rubbed me my face. She needed a hand Linda. I trust you. What do you think? What do you think this is? I know this is far from ideal, but why can't we remain friends like in the beginning? This is not the beginning. We're far from the beginning Walter. This is the end. I'm serious. Go get the doctor. Linda. Papa, do you love us? Yes. Do you love to make a life for us, right? Of course. Sylvia, I was just taking out the trash. Do you need anything? There's not. Oh. Sylvia. Wow. Look a this! Big girl. Let me see, let me see. What! She's grown. I need to use the bathroom. Hey girl, you would probably be seducing some hot New York dude by the time you get this, I told Rajab to just forget about you. I mean please. She's off to greener pastures. New York. He's so depressed, imagine that I've missed you. I'm going to keep making those remixes for my girl. So when you become the most famous dancer in America, the rest of us can at least in your enterlarge. Good morning mum. I thought we talked about those. I don't know why you insist on wearing those ugly boots all the time. You're so pretty. All the children at your school will think Africans are turkey. These are my comfortable shoes ma'am. You want me to be uncomfortable? As soon as I get a job we'll go to the shopping to get some proper clothes. We won't bother your father about that right now. Good morning. Morning. Here, were having a dance. I don't know if you want to participate if you dance or anything. You guys can go in. Thank you. I'm here to enroll my daughter. Yes, do you speak English? Yes, but she's just adjusting into the American accent. Okay. And I see we're still missing an official birth certificate. We have this. This is a letter. Yes, I explained when I telephoned that Sylvia was born during the civil war in our country. And both the hospital and department of records were destroyed, so we don't have any original birth papers. Okay. I'll have Ms. Tami enroll you and take you to class. So she just start right now? Yes, you can pick her up at 3:30 after school. Hi, it's me. Hey, wait, where are you going? Where'd you just waiting for your bus? Yo, chill out, calm down. Yo, yo yo. Chill out, will you? Will you start over? Hi, I'm Devin. But most people call me DJ. Hi, I'm Silvia, most people call me Silvia. Hi Silvia, from Angola? Someone meeting in the States or? Yes. No, my father was here before, he is a diplomat. Wow, okay. Cool. You dance? Why do you accuse me of these? Just most of the girls on the step team wear those. Well I do know for a fact that step team needs another separate for the dance if you're interested. What is this price? It's $2000 for best soul and best team. No. Why not? I don't know the steps. That's easy, you just look up videos on YouTube, use the videos to practice. You just have to know how to dance. Then, if I agree to look at the steps, you'll let me pass? I'll see you later Sylvia. We should go to the market this weekend and get some bananas. And something without cholesterol for your father. Have you seen the way he eats fish? Is that Neema? Did she married? Not yet. One day you meet a nice boy. Hey, maybe in university, that's how I met your father. Yes. He was studying journalism. You were studying social sciences and you both suspect that each other being communists. He got on my nerves so much. Always talking about politics the whole nights. I told you this story too many times. He's good a man Vinnia, loyal. Yes Ma'am. It's not his fault that we had to wait so many years. You know, we tried everything. Why didn't he come back home then? Because we wanted you to have the life that we couldn't have. Huh? I don't want to suffer anymore. Oh God, those days are behind us now. Everything is going to be fine I promise. God is good. Today's topic, immigration and emigration. You have two different lists. I want you all to turn to page 25. I'm gonna go down look at the two different lists. Oh, Mr. Jamison, you're late. Sorry for being late Mr. Tunaw. Immigration, life equality, religious freedom. Take out a piece of paper and I want you to start writing down. Hi DJ, what's your African grow from? All right, settle down. Everybody's settled out. Everybody turn to page 25. Okay. Yes. Mr. Jamison, please turn the pages. Okay, here we go. Immigration first list. Sylvia. Sylvia. I tried calling but you didn't hear me. - What were... - It's nothing. It's nothing. You could have injured yourself. I was exercising. Your mother suggested that maybe we should, I mean, I should try and talk to you, just to see if everything was all right. How long has she been so religious? When we moved to Tanzania, first she just wants us to have a community but then she got really serious about it. Then you? Then as long as I'm reading the Bible she doesn't get on my case too much. Do you miss home? Don't you? Well after the war, the home that I knew was gone. Do you mind if I share why, or wait her to finish. My mom will be upset if she knows I didn't give you my bed. No, no no. She doesn't have to know. I can turn off the light. No no no, keep exercising. It was finished. Linda. Yes dad. This country is very hard for black people especially foreigners. You always have to carry yourself in a certain way so that white people don't feel threatened. So when we get to dance, that's the one place that I can actually be myself, show myself. So be yourself, you're the only one who knows what you know, and who can do what you do. Yes Bai. It's the one that you sent to mama when we first moved to Tanzania. I liked it so she let me wear it. Anywhere else? There is a little bruise, but nothing too unusual. Where did you learn this song? Different parties in Dar es Salaam. Everybody would dance to it and cry, cry, cry. Till Mama stopped going to the parties. She didn't want me to dance anymore. Can I get the apartments for $1,000? Depends wherever you are currently. Are you planning on running away or something? I'm just planning for the future. You can do this. Thanks. Five, six, seven, here we go. What are you doing? What was that? Oh nothing, it was just something... Did you see me do that? - No, I... - Don't do that. We have a routine. All we needed someone to learn a routine and execute it the way it needs to be done. Now can you do that or not? Get away from me? What happened? I told you I can't stop it you insisted. And now you've embarrassed me. Calm down, I saw you up there learning the moves. You're doing great. Well, your friend has a problem with me because she could poke poke me like I'm. Like I'm a Shish kebab. Oh boy, okay. Come on. Let me just take you Shish kabash asshole. - The bathroom is down there. - Cool. Sorry, it's a mess. I don't usually have guests. No, it's cool. It's cool. Who's that? That's Neema. My best friend from back home. She's a DJ. Oh word. You miss it there? My friends think my life is perfect now. They think having a celebrity, crazy partying. All my family's down South, so I get the same thing. I remember the year really knows what it's like there. So, you just feel alone. What about your parents? They are complicated. My dad, isn't really a diplomat. I figured, you don't really hear about too many diplomats living in the hood. I know how it feels without my paps. I know how it feels. So what you going to do after graduation? I don't know. Maybe start working, go to State college or something. You're not going to continue with the stage lights and promotion? Well, not unless you become a famous dancer Miss Sylvia. Sylvia. Sorry mama, I didn't know you were- - Hi Ma'am. I'm a Devin Jamison. How are you, Devin Jamison? I'm good. You have a lovely home Ma'am. You've seen my home? Just the bathroom. Sorry mama, I didn't know you were home. So you brought a man home when you thought I wasn't home. No. I just wanted to make sure that Sylvia got home safe after dance tryouts. I probably should be heading home to do some homework. Yes. Oh, say hello to your parents. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Excuse me ma'am. You can do anything Mama. You just say squats to me home. Linda, If you and I going to dinner tonight. I don't know what's gotten into you, but I expected better. You know, I only do this for your own good because I can see things you can't. Your father and I doing best to protect you. From now on, you go to school, you come straight back. No friends, no activities and no dancing. Are you listening? This hurts me more than it hurts you, but you will repent and seek forgiveness for what you did. Our Father who is at heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses. What is she doing? I will not lose my daughter to this country. Family is here now. This is for you. Thank you. This one is for you. Come. For the gift of food, for the gift of shelter that you have provided for me and my family. Praise Jesus for this day, and my boss be free from trouble. And the destructive hand of Satan. May I return safely from school, and may dad return safely from America, I mean, work, amen. Amen. It's a passage of scripture that always fascinated me. You always do this. And I should have listened to my soul. I should've listened to my spirit because this is airy bullshit. So narcissist, this it's so good. And You know what? I don't have time for this. I don't have the psychic bandwidth. You know what don't act up is that we have to act and work together. All right, you know what we're done, come and get your shit. Who is it? Henzinga, from next door. Just a moment. Oh. Is Walter still live here? I'm afraid he's at work at the moment. I'm his wife, Esther. Oh, pleased to meet you queen. Pleased to meet you too Queen? Excuse me, I was just cleaning the house but you're welcome to come inside. Oh no sorry, I just wanted to drop off some mail that was put in my box. I will make sure I give them to my husband when he comes home. Okay. Peace. He who is build together with the Lord, let no man tear at sudden. You know my heart, Lord. You know my struggles. It's the word of God, that need to follow. Some of us are trying to lead our families With the temptations. How are you queen? Fine. Thank you. You've been shopping? Did you go to the Korean market on the corner? Sometimes their food isn't always so fresh. I was looking for some millet flour for Walter. He has the cholesterol, so. You know, I can take you to the Egyptian market where I get my food. I'm heading there now. No, I don't want to disturb you. It's really no problem. Your neighborhood is dramatically. We used to have a lot of people. It's very busy. Yeah. It's very busy. Alaikum salaam, good to see you. You eat very healthy. You know I try. I'm doing much better that I'm not in a relationship. I am just grateful the time finally reunited with Walter after so many years apart and I must've struggled a lot. I was wondering how he learned how to cook all these low fat foods. Maybe you helped him. You know how men are. They know how to find their resources. Was that a woman named Linda who lived in the apartment before Walter moved in? Did you get more ashwagandha powder this week? - No, ma'am. - No. You know what, sometimes it takes them so long to restock their items but I really want to support the local businesses. And this brokers are Africans. You know we should head back. Did you get your flour? Yes. Thank you. Thank you Lord. You have 30 minutes for this call. May your name be blessed. Hello. Sister Redemter? Ah, my Esther. How are you settling in? Oh, it is a challenge, my sister. I'm home mostly by myself so usually I just thinking, thinking, missing my community there. How is our Sylvia doing over there? She's trying her best. In Jesus name, save Sylvia please. Guide her. And how's Walter? He's working very hard. His life here is so difficult. I don't believe you're married. I usually go to them on week days because am usually back home on Sundays. Oh, welcome to our flock. But I'm trying my best to help him and to pray for him. Protect Walter and guide him please. He's the head Father God. I am proud of you my sister. You endured many many years of hardships, and stayed faithful to God's command. Don't forget to send your offerings. We must always give thanks. Especially when God answers our prayers. I'm not hungry. I thought you might say that. So I made you a flask of tea with some olds today. And a little sugar. You work so hard to look after us, allow me to now look after you. Thank you, it's very nice. No, thank you. And how was your day? You know, the usual things. I had a question. I had some money that I kept in case of an emergency and I thought maybe you could help me send it to our church in Dar El Salaam?. They have been praying for us for so many years. It should be offering of thanks. I can send it through on my lunch break tomorrow. There's transfer place near work. That's wonderful. How much money is this? $1,000. You're sending the church, 1000? Yes, this is for several years I kept it in case of an emergency. But now that God has delivered us... He hasn't, He hasn't delivered us. We are here. Yes, yes. Do you know what that means? Means I have to work harder than before and we have less than before. All this time I've been working double and triple shifts. Do you know what we could have done with this money? This money is for God so that he will favor us. As we rebuild our family, our marriage. I can't do this right now. Next. Yes, I'd like to send this money to Dar El Salaam, Tanzania. Your ID? Sister Redemta? How are you my child? I sent the money, but... What is the problem? Tell me what is in your heart. It's just, I think I think we might be unequally yoked. Unequally yoked? Dah! Yes sister. What can I do? He's the man that God has given me. And why would he do that if there wasn't a reason for it. God would not lead you to the desert and abandon you. That dutiful wife who prays for husband and family, would be head fast. Continue to pray, increase your offering. You cannot give up. Now bow your head. Let's pray together. Heavenly father, we come before you with sister Esther, Lord we ask you to give her peace. We are going to with the stage lights and promotion. Unless you become a famous dancer Miss Sylvia. Sylvia. She is a teenager, it's not to annoy us, just calm down. Let's just take a moment. Let's go ahead and talk. I don't think you understand Walter. This is not the time for going out to dinner. Clearly we need to be at home watching our daughter. Who? Esther. Who? Esther. Walter's wife. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. I wanted to ask you a favor please my sister. I'm going to dinner with Walter tonight and I need to borrow just a pest to go with this outfit. Girl, you're gonna be way more than just a purse. Come on. Come on. So where are you going for dinner? I'm not sure, he didn't tell me. Oh, so it's a surprise. All right. That's nice of him. Well, actually we have been talking about this for a while, but today's not really a good day. That's nonsense, life is short. You can't put stuff on hold. Okay. I agree, you're right. Good, so we need to looking Royal. Actually I am a Christian. So nothing too... Honey, you're out here worried about another woman's male. When you're hiding the essence of your womanhood from your own husband? Is that really what white Jesus wants? Sometimes a King names his queen to remind him who she is. Now, come on. You look very beautiful. I'm glad you like it. Can I get you anything else? Coffee please. No, thank you. Thank you for bringing me here. It's very nice. Remember when life was simple, when a fancy night was sitting on the beach having fish over fire. What was she blind? Red snapper with Jedungo hoka. And plantains. From Donna Megalish place on the corner. Did she survive? I'm not even sure. After we left for Tanzania I lost touch with so many people. Let's dance. Where? Here, on this side. We can't do that. Why not? The band is warming up. Shouldn't we wait for them to start the party properly? I'm not stopping. Come join me. You are embarrassing yourself. Then come rescue me. We'll be embarrassed together. See, it's working. It has been so long I don't even remember how. You're always the most beautiful, when you dance. From the donation box. - Wait. - Get rid of this. It's a rule. I have heard you Walter, loud and clear. You don't want me, you want something else. This was too big for us to not lose ourselves. I want to go back home. I need to know who she is. You're ready to kill it at the cyber today? Yeah, Neema made me a special dance. You get out of here forget about dancing. Forget about everything. Thanks DJ. For what? Everything. You know I catch you. I was, you know. I'm looking for my daughter. She is a dancer. We have Judy Joseph. Our reigning champion. Let's take a five minute break before we get to this next round. Where are you going? I have to go. I made a mistake, I have to go. Sylvia, hold on. We have to go find her. She's all I have. This is my responsibility Vinnia, go. Fight for your dance. I'll find her. Up next ladies and gentlemen, our defeating Sylvia Lako as a free to a battle with the new kid on the block, Your Africa. I have been lost. And Linda found you. she gives me hope as dad. She insists that I don't give up and I keep petitioning immigration, for us to be together. You think it was easy for me? Of course not. I lost so many years. Sorry. We don't even know each other anymore. Or our child. When we met, I didn't know if I could see the next day. I didn't know who was a comrade, who was an informant, who was there for the light. When I move, you follow. When you hesitate, I slow down. 'Cause we could feel each other. So, what do we do now? I said you went dancing. What happened? The crowd. They really liked me mama. They saw me. Of course they did. We will see you, we do. Make us pray first.
