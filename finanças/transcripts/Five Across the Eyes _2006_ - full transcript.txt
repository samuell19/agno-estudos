♪ [electronic pop] ♪ Hey! Don't mess with my mom's van. Belle, keep your eyes on the road. I didn't spill, all right? Okay, seriously, we need to figure out where we are. Hello. We're on the road. Jamie, how would you like a punch in the face? Can you please take this? Because I can‘t find it. That's because it's not on there. Give it to me. It's a small road. It's not going to be on a map like that. - Bullshit. - Please watch your language. You don't even know what road this is. Can I just interject something here? I think it would be best if we stopped turning on these side roads, and turn around and go back to the game and follow everyone else. We're just going on this road to see where it ends up. We've been seeing where it ends up for the past 35 minutes. Come on, Belle. Turn around. Let's go. I don't care. Whatever. Okay, how about we vote on it? Yeah, that's a great idea. I second that. Or how about we let the person with the license actually do the driving and let her choose which way to go? This is ridiculous. This is America. We have maps. Everything is charted out. I don't know what to do. If we turn back now, there's no way I'm going to make it home by 11. And if we keep going this way, we may never get home at all. Hey, Mel, I would appreciate it if you wouldn't make any more comments like that. Wait. Why do we have to be back by 11? Because of my license. l'm not supposed to be driving out this late, and I'm not supposed to be driving with you-- What? Nothing. I was told this way would be faster, and it's not, so next time, we're just going to ride with Melanie's dad. Or, Steph, we'll ride with your mom. Yeah, and I'll have to listen to Bryan Adams the whole time. Are you sure this way is going to get us home? All I know is this is the road that the guy told me. Just a minute ago she was like, "I swear this is the road." And now she's like, "Maybe. Uh, I don't know." Hey, what's that light up-- Hey, there's a place! - It's civilization! - Oh, yeah. S-Sort of. You're pulling over, I hope you know. I hope you know you're pulling over. You're getting real directions. Well, someone's going in there with me. [chuckling] - I'm not going in there by myself. - Ugh. Fine. ♪ [country on radio] ♪ - Hey, hey. - What? Where are you going? To find out if this place has a bathroom. Um... I saw you talking to Steve Klusky. Yeah, um, he was-- he was asking about-- something about Mr. Morlock and whether or not we had something due on Monday. Oh, but then he starts talking about his neighbor and that he has a wooden foot and something else. - I don't know. - Well, I think he likes you. Yeah, I know. I saw you touching him. Were you spying on me? No, I glanced over for, like, a second, and it was only because you told me that you were going to the concession stand. And you were gone the entire second quarter and did not come back with any food. Okay. Okay. - No. - I'm sorry. No, I'm the scum bucket of the Earth for looking over you. Aw! Stop. Quit it. Stop. - You know you're not mad. - Steph. Steph. - Aw. - Stop. Hey, what's going on in here? Stop. Steph. get off me. Yeah, if you all need some alone time, we can go back inside. Hey, I'm not going back in there. That place is disgusting. Did you at least find out where we're going? Yeah, we're going down this road, which I said all along. Hey, where did Melanie go? - I don't know. - Oh, Jesus. Hey, hey, let's leave her. It'd be hilarious! Okay. [beeping] [Jamie] About time! Belle, pull forward. Okay, we won't pull up this time. - Come on. - Get in the van, Melanie. Hurry up! [crash] Oh, damn. You just hit a car. Shit! No! God, no! [mouthing words] - Oh, my God. - How bad is it? I don't think you really did. Yeah, you hit his headlights. The van looks fine, though. Oh, God, my mom's gonna be so pissed! l say we just put a 20 on his windshield and be done with it. You want me to go get the driver? No! G-- I don't know! Why's this got to happen to me? Well, you were being irresponsible, for one. Let's just go! We can't leave the scene of an accident. Do you want Belle to get in trouble? - No. - Okay, then. [Belle] Stop yelling! Okay, well, the guy obviously doesn't know we hit his car, or he would have come out here already, so-- and I don't think these people care. Okay. I say we go. [mouths word] - Damn it! Shit! - Hey-- Why'd I do that? I got to go back. No. Just keep going. You already screwed the pooch in doing the right thing. Thank you for finally climbing aboard with the rest of us, Mel. [Belle] Why do I listen to you guys? Uh, correction. Not "you guys." - I said to stay. - God, I'm so screwed in the ass. Well, think about it this way. At least you got your first hit and run out of the way. God, I'm feeling queasy. Hey, you're fine. Steph. shut up. Oh, God. I didn‘t know what to do. And you-- you guys said-- If we would have stayed there, your mom would have grounded you, and you know what that means: riding around with your parents. And that's a big "hell, no" on that part. You've said it yourself. No more walking to Baskin-Robbins, no more riding our bikes to the pool. "It's a new dawn," I believe, were the words that you used. - What are you doing? - Turning around. - This obviously isn't the right way. - Well, how do you know? The guy said it would be half a mile down the road. Yeah, and what if we didn't go half a mile? Well, what was the road? "Dead Horse Road" or something like that? You know, the one that takes us to the interstate? Dead Horse Road? That's a flag right there. Or "Eyes" or something like that. What's Eyes? You know, the area around here. Uh, are you sure he just wasn't using "I" in a conjunction, like, "l's been livin' in this here area for about..." Nobody's even listening. Well, there's nothing on here about Dead Horse Road or Eyes. We're gonna be spending the night out here. Aren't we? [gasps] Oh, my God. There's the car that we hit. He's turning around. Go! You concentrate on driving really, really fast. [Stephanie] Maybe he just wants to exchange insurance information. Do you even have insurance information? He could be getting my license plate number. Shit! He could be, like, a cop off duty. God, I'm so dead! This is why you don't leave the scene of an accident. How did he even know that we hit his car? Uh, hello. He followed us from the store. Yes, I know that, but the whole reason we left was because he didn't see us. We didn't think we were going to get caught. The people on the porch probably told him. He was probably watching us the whole time. He was just waiting for us to leave, and now he's going to come after us and disembowel us. Hey, that is the last time I'm gonna hear anything like that. You understand? Nobody in this car is getting dis-- dis-- - ...disem-- whatever you said. - Motherfuck! There's the road! Oh, crap, Belle! Slow down! Hold on! [tires screeching] God, get off! Those turns, you can't just accelerate into them like that. You'll roll the van over completely, and it'll be good-night. You know about the rolling, how easy it is to ﬂip a van? Yes! Please shut up! Hey, if you want to know if he's following you, make three right tums-- God, there are no freakin' turns! Oh, come on! Clearly he's following us. - Belle, drive faster! - Ow! You hit me in the face. Oh, my God. Oh, crap. You guys, check your phones. See if anybody has a signal. No. And they promised these phones work anywhere. Oh, this is such BS because I can't do anything about it right now. Well, you can start by shutting the hell up. Belle, don't tell her to shut up. She's scared right now. God! Just stop talking! Oh, God. Did you check my phone? Oh, I shouldn't have turned around. We've got to go back-- We've got to go back to the store. Where are you going to turn around? No! Don‘t! [both shouting at once] [Stephanie] Belle, drive faster! - Are you sure you're flooring it? - l am! [Caroline] All right, we can-- we can run him off the road. He's got a bigger vehicle. Belle, slow down. Seriously, just pull over. Are you crazy? What if that guy's trying to kill us? Remember what she said about "disemberance"? Calm down. He's not trying to kill us. All right, it's nothing. I'm sure it's fine. Well, I'm having a nervous breakdown. Just pull over, find out what he wants, Bella. Okay, worst idea ever! Bella, your mom will be ten times more mad if you total this van than if you hit someone's-- You don't know what this guy's capable of. - Exactly! - Then why do you want us pulling over? - He could have a gun! - Or a bomb or stabbing weapon! Yeah. Road rage isn't that uncommon, you know. We're not on a freaking lane. Oh, God, does it gives him the right to rage us on the road? Maybe we could just pay him for the damage, and maybe that will make him go away. I've got five dollars. - How much y'all think it is? - I didn't do anything. We need to smash the other effing headlight. I can't do this. I can't keep driving. You're going to have to. No, seriously, I can't. My hands are, like, dripping wet. - I can't even hold onto the steering wheel. - All right, all right. Anyone got anything to wipe it off with? A towel, a napkin, anything? Here, use this. Oh, yes. Here you go. Here you go. Road! Oh, Shit! [tires squealing] You think I can't see that? It's totally burning into my eyes. God, I can barely see. God, please give Isabella the strength to drive really fast. Please get us back home safely. Somebody keep track of where we're going so we don't get so far, like, in that we can't find our way out. Why don't you? Whatever problem they have, just leave us alone. [tires screeching] - What happened to the road? - Turn around, turn around, turn around! Oh, no. Go, please! l can't! There's nowhere to go. There's not enough room. It's completely blocked. Bella, just ram him. Knock him out of the way. Oh, I would so be flooring it right now. There's nowhere to freakin' go! There's a ditch! [all screaming] Right now! Get out! Oh, my God! I will shoot you! Turn it off! Turn off the van! No, Bella! [turns off ignition] Don't do it. Tell her to stop it! Go! Get out of the car! Don't let her get out. Don't-- Don't let her in! Don't let her in! Get out! [girls screaming] [Woman] Get out and throw me the key! - [keys landing] - Pick 'em up and hand them to me! [girls whimpering] [Woman] Now walk! All of you! Out! Now! No, no, no. Look. I will spray your brains all over the inside of this car! l will! Now crawl-- Ah! No, no! - This side! - [girls screaming] Let's go. This side only. Crawl over the seat. Let's go! Get out! Let's go! - [girls crying] - Oh, God! Get out. Quick. Get out. [crying] We're sorry. We're sorry for-- Get your asses on the ground. Hush up! Shut up! Down! [sniveling] Shut up! How much did you see? Huh? What did you see? We didn't see anything. Stop lying to me, girl! I'll turn the whole van into a room for a necrophiliac. [pumps shotgun] [girls sobbing] Don't move. Don't move. Oh, God! We're all going to stay as still as possible right now. Not one movement, or boom! I'll do it! [girls crying] Please, we'll do anything! Just don't kill us! Anything? You turned a mother's own daughter against her. How dare you destroy my family! [Belle] We don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do! You home-wrecker! Up against the van! Let's go! Go! To the front! Oh, God. Now take off your clothes. Why? Why? Because I want to see what's so special about you. - Now take 'em off! - Please, no! I will blow the flesh off your fucking skull. Understand, you little shit? Now take 'em off! Please don't make us. Please, please. - Please don't make us. - Let's go. [girls crying] You can't do this. - Please. - Blah, blah, blah. Put them in a pile. In a pile right there! Please. Please. Please? Please? Everything. Take everything off. Hurry up! Don't take all night. [sobbing] Please. Ha ha. Girls, don't cross your arms. Hands at your sides. Come on. No covering up. [girls crying] Get over here! Now... [girls quieting down] Be a good little girl and tinkle on your clothes, okay? I need you to pee pee on your clothes, or I will ram this gun so far up your ass that it will blow your insides out of your fuckin' mouth! You brought your filth into my home. Into my bed! [shouting hysterically] Do it! Bam! - I can't! Bam! Okay, I'll do it. No, no, don't do it. All right. No. Get over here. Let's go! Stop it! No! Get down! Why? What? You have to let us go. Do l? Like heck. I don't see anything. Don't-- Don't talk to me, for me. [trickling] There you go. Good girl. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now get back over there, you filthy slut! All right, on your knees. All of you! Don't look at me. Don't look at me! - Turn around! - [girls screaming] Turn around! Don't look at me. Shut up! Next one to make a sound gets their face ripped off by a hundred little pellets. Think that's gonna feel good, huh? Do you? [screaming] Don't make me mad. [girls crying] What time am I supposed to pick up the girls? Oh, my God. I still got to get ready. I'm gonna be late. Oh, God! Oh, God. [car door closes] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [sobbing] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [all sobbing] Holy shit. What just happened? Oh, my God. Bella, it's okay. [sniveling] You're safe now. She's gone. l-- I just want to forget everything that just happened and go home. Steph. Steph. you all right? Well, l have pee all over my leg. This is so gross. It's fine. We're gonna get dressed now, okay? Okay? Okay. Ugh. Ugh, it's wet. [Melanie] I know it is. Ugh. Why-- Why did she do this to us? We-- I-- We don't even know her family. That woman had something seriously wrong with her. I mean, you just don't do that to people. You don't make somebody urinate on their own clothes. [Jamie] Can we not relive the situation, okay? I'm never leaving my room again. I'm just going to tell my parents, "Next time I say I want to go do something, you say, 'No. Go to your room."' I want to go home and forget this all happened. We can't. She took the keys. How the shit are we supposed to get home, then? We could hot-wire the van. You don't know how to hot-wire the van. [whimpering] [Jamie] What are we going to do? [whimpering] - Belle. - Yeah. Talk to me. Are you okay? There-- There's a spare key. - Where? Where? - It's in the car well. It's in a small metal box. [rummaging] [Jamie] Thank God. Steph. get out, get out. [Stephanie] I almost had it. [Jamie] You didn't do anything, seriously. Let's just get everyone in the van, let's go. [Jamie sobbing] [grunting] God! Stop. Stop it. [wailing] Just go. We'll go when she's ready. She's got all these strange feelings going on in her head right now. We need to be supportive and not rush her. Just give her a couple of minutes. We don't have a couple of minutes! [sobbing] I want to go home! Of course you do. We all do. But we're not helping by acting frantic around her. It's over. We're all okay. [sobbing continues] Bella, you okay enough to drive? Uh-huh. Bella, come on. Let's go. I want to get out of here. [engine starts] [door shuts] [Jamie sobbing] Bella, you sure you're okay? Where's my-- Where's my seatbelt? You have it on. Okay. [Belle] Oh. Okay. [shifting gears] [Melanie] Bella, just floor it. Come on, we'll fly right past her. [engine accelerating] [screaming] For God's sake, Bella, whatever you do, don't let off the gas. What the hell does she wants? Still following us. [horn honking] [all screaming] [honking continues] [sobbing] [honking continues] If we go off the road, she'll get us again. Please, go faster, please. [honking] - [tires screeching] - Aah! [sobbing] l'm bleeding. [honking] My nose. She'll run us off the road. Please, please go faster! [honking fades] [sobbing] l can't-- l can't get this open. You don't need a Band-aid. [Melanie] Tilt your head forward. [honking gets louden] Back! No, you're not. Here. Here. Put this in your nose. How am I suppose to breathe? Breathe through your mouth. Come on, get it together. [honking] [crash] [screaming] God! Oh, shit! We got to do something. l can't keep driving like this. See if there's anything behind the seats. We have to start throwing shit at her! Whoa, Jamie. Now you're talking crazy. The speedometer goes up to 120. Why aren't we going 120? l can't go in this freaking car 120 miles an hour! So there-- Something's, like, bad back there! [Belle] We're almost out of gas. [Melanie] Seriously? Oh, my God. What is this? [Belle] Those are my dad's ashes. This should be in a cemetery somewhere, not in my hands. They haven't got buried yet. Put it away! - Here, take it. - I don't want it! We need to throw stuff at her. Open the back door. Don't throw that. We might need it. Oh, Caroline. Are you okay? [Jamie] Watch the road. l can't. There's no freakin' button. l can't open it through this. Caroline, be careful. Hold on to something and don't let go. l've thrown stuff at cars before. l'll hold on to you. I won't let go. - Oh! Did she hit it? - [honk] I got it. - Quick. give me something else. - Hand her something else. Here. [honks] She's missing. Stephanie, you do it. No! You play softball! - Now who's scared shitless? - Fuck. [Stephanie] I am not hanging out a vehicle moving at a high-rate speed. - Move! - What if I get thrown out? [Belle] What do you need me to do? Do you need me to go left? [clatter] - Holy shit! - Get in the car. Ew! What is that? Smells like a giant gorilla took a dump on a burning tire. Ugh. Melanie, what the hell are you doing? Oh, God, she took a crap in here. What did you throw? Feces Melanie did! What? She shit in, like, the van? [laughter] For God's sakes, Melanie. That was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life. Open the window. I'm getting sick. [vent buzzing] [Jamie] Damn, that was foul. But it worked, didn‘t it? Why waste it when you can taste it? Caroline, this is not funny. I'm getting sick. Oh, that gross popcorn I had at the game is about to come back up. Oh, God, I had nachos, too. Okay, yeah. Can you, um, wipe your hands off with something or hang them out the window? Open my purse. There's some wipey things in there. My dad sends them with me in case there's nowhere for me to wash my hands. Why? Do you make it a habit of snapping off cigars in your hand? Gross. Are there any more? No, that's it. Here. It's all we've got. Okay, let's get the map to find out where we're at. Yeah, uh, don't start talking until you're done wiping up over there. Ugh. [Stephanie vomits] - Would you mind pulling over? - Oh, God! I thought that was a sneeze. - Whoa. - I'm sorry. It just kind of came up. Aah! [tires screeching] - Damn, Belle! - Aw! Can't-- Can't you drive over that? [Belle] Uh, no. We got to move it. Let's go. Hurry! [Caroline] Stephanie, are you okay? Yeah. I just-- - l can't stand septic-like odors. - Oh, baby, it's all over your shirt. Take it off. There's like-- Oh, there's popcorn all over this. Oh, don't examine it. I'll throw up again. Here, put this on. Come on. - You could just throw that away. - Are you sure? It has throw-up and pee all over it. - It's not moving. - Push harder! Hello, it's not happening. [Caroline] Hey, guys. - What? - Come here. There's a clearing. I think we can get through over here. Oh, shit. [Belle] Everyone, get in! Come on, Bella, get us home. I don't know where I'm going. What? What? Nothing. I was just seeing how fast you're going because she's catching up. She's got to be going, like, 100 miles an hour. Do something with this. [all screaming] [tires screeching] Oh! Oh, my neck! - Shit! - Oh, God. I'm still alive. I thought that was it. Everybody else okay? [coughing] Was that my dad? [honks] Move your heads. [Melanie] Go faster! l can't see! [car honks] Oh, God. It's freaking on my mouth. I think I ate some. Oh, God, if something happened, I think I'm gonna get sick again. [honking continues] [Jamie] Keep your eyes back there. I'll watch her. l freakin' can't see because of the stupid writing. [Melanie] Do your best. Are you crying? Don't start crying. You are driving now. Shut up! l can't see. Hold on! Oh, shit. [car honking] What was that? What's wrong with your van? Oh, God. Please don't leave me now. No, not happening. Not happening! What do you want from us? [all screaming] [screaming louder] Go, Belle, go! Oh, my God! [engine shuts oil] [girls crying] - I think I killed her. - Self-defense! I just killed someone. Fuck her! She had it coming. Stupid cum-guzzling whore! My mom's gonna be so mad at me. l just-- I just hit someone with her van. l spilled Dad all over the inside. [crying] Bella, go back. Run her over again. - What are you doing? - I'm going to make sure she's... [engine chugging] For God's sakes, give us a break! No, no, no! Come on, start! Forget going back there. Just get this van started and let's go. It won't. Come on! This isn't working. Let's go take hers. Are you insane? [engine chugging] It's easy. We take it and we get as far away from here as we can because we're obviously not getting home in this. What if that woman gets up? We hit her with the freakin' van. She's not getting up. Belle! [engine chugging] Belle, it's dead! Stop. Come on. Let's go. We can do this. [weeping] I just want to get out of here. - Belle, come on! - What about my mom's van? Just leave it. It's okay. [shuts off car] [music stops] Uh, the light went out! Her headlight just went out! She's up! Run! We've got to hide the van, turn off the lights. Help me push it into the trees! Guys, get back here! Come on. Okay. [all grunting] Belle, steer. We got to find-- We have to find things to cover the van with. Everybody, get in! She saw us. She knows where we're at. She's-- She's just right down there. She had to have seen us. [exhales] Oh, God. She didn't see us. Holy shit, Caroline. You almost had us walk right up to her. Well, if we had not taken, like, 10 minutes to talk about the situation and gone when I said, yes, we would be on our way home right now. We need to take turns watching the road in case a car comes, so we can flag it down. No way. What if it's that woman? If it has two headlights, it's not going to be. There's a pretty good chance we're stuck here till morning. l-- I need to put my dad back. Where-- Where's the... [thunder rumbling] Oh, God. This looks like concrete. I'm serious. When my grandfather was cremated, his ashes looked like dark gray crushed seashells, and this... looks like concrete. Takes like it, too. [Belle] Shut up! That's my dad you're talking about. Except, I don't think it is. Yeah, wasn't it that place in Georgia that was doing that? Where was your dad cremated? Not there, okay? I don't want to talk about this right now. [crying] Here. [sniffling] Why does everything always happen to me? My mom-- My mom's catching-- We get hit by a random woman. My dad's ashes, they aren't even-- they aren't even real. I made one mistake. I don't think I deserve all this shit. Mel, I'm sorry I was pulling away from you. l was doing it just so you couldn't get in the van. Let's not worry about that right now. No. I'm sorry for playing jokes on you. I probably did it way too often. And I don't mean to. I'm sorry for everything I've done to you lately. Like what? Like shooting Roman candles at you and lighting them and making you-- and tell you to just run. [crying] Oh, yeah. I really got burned. I still have a scar on my leg. [sniffles] l'm sorry for-- - Is that all you're sorry about? - No. I'm sorry that a lot of cruel people gang up on you. I'm sorry I go along with it. I'm also sorry that I tell you l have to do homework... and then I go out with Jamie instead. And I'm sorry I don't invite you to come. I'm really sorry we don't hang out like we used to. I really miss it. I haven't gone anywhere. I know. Yeah. I guess you don't always deserve everything I do to you. You guess? So you don't know? [thunder rumbling] [Stephanie] HEY. guys. Um... [clears throat] Maybe we could get to the top of one of these hills and then maybe we could get a signal on one of our cell phones. That's a great idea right there. You want to go walking through the woods in pitch dark? We have a flashlight, don't we? Hey, guys, maybe we could get to the top of one of these hills and then we could get a signal on one of our cell phones. Stephanie, you just said that. [thud] [horn honks] What was that? Did you just touch something? [horn honks] Oh, my God, she's got the keys. Run! Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

She stuffed this. [drops screwdriver] Caroline, I'm so sorry. There she is! Stephanie! We're coming! Belle, why aren't you going? Caroline, sit back! [Caroline crying] Go! Stephanie, we're coming! Why aren't you going? Come on! Go! Please. [Melanie] Do something! - What do you want me to do? - Go, Bella, go! [all yelling] No, Bella! Where are we going? Stephanie! We have to go! Hang on! She's going to kill her! - [smack] - What's wrong with you? Stop it! You're scaring us! Bella, come on. Find her. [mouthing words] - Right or left? - Right! - Should I go right? - Yeah! [Belle] Uh, may-- maybe we should've gone left. Maybe we should stop listening to every little idea Melanie has. I know y'all felt sorry for her and everything... What's that supposed to mean? It means maybe you should find someone else to tag along with. Jamie, burn in hell. She can't make decisions on her own because she's too worried about what you might-- Guys, stop! Right there! [stops engine] Why is she sitting there? You think she's waiting on us again? [Belle] There's no one in there. [Caroline] Come on, I'm not going alone. Hold up. Let's make sure we're not walking into a trap. Caroline! Caroline, get back in here! I don't think you should be walking. Caroline. [sobbing] Is one of us dead? [crying] No. No. Oh, my God. [Jamie] Well, check! [Melanie] Those are really dead people. [Caroline] Where's Stephanie? Where-- We have to find her. [Jamie] Why did you have to open the back of her car? [Belle] Those are the last people that broke her headlight off. That's what she's going to do to us! We got to get out of here! We have to find Stephanie. We're not going to find her marching off into the woods. And definitely not with some strange woman out there. For all I know, she could be walking to us right now. We're leaving! [groans] This is, like, the third time I've thrown up. Ew! It's a whole family. I think one of them is a little boy. What the hell? Stop poking at 'em. Damn! We need to find that ugly crack whore and smash her flicking face in until there's nothing but blood and broken teeth and bone fragments! Do you know what she did to me? Do you know what she's gonna do to Stephanie? Do you know what she's gonna do to us if we don't get out of here? - No, thank you. - Stephanie! I value my life! We can pop her tires. [crying] Stephanie. Let's just let out the air. Bella, come and help. Okay. What do I do? What do I do? Press on the nozzle. [air hissing] It's not doing anything. [gunshot] That's it! We're getting outta here right now. Get in the van! - Get Caroline! - What about Stephanie? Think about it. She broke out the window. She ran. She's nowhere near here. We don't know that. Well, pretend! Come on, Caroline. Come on. No, I'm not going. No, I'm not leaving her! Why won't you help me find her? No, I'm not going. Please don't make me go. I don't want to. [Jamie] Go, go, get in. [Caroline] No. No, please. Don't make me go. No. Steph. [coughing] You see anything? Give me the flashlight. Steph! Steph! Steph. come on! Stephanie! Steph! [coughing] This flashlight sucks. I can't see anything. This isn't working. We need to be out there searching in the woods. I bet she was out here to bury those bodies, and then we got-- and then we hit her and now-- We're not gonna talk about it, okay? Got it? I don't think she came this way. Turn around, go back the other way. This is so screwed up. l was just talking to Stephanie last night. You were just talking to her, like, 10 minutes ago. No, she called me last night. [Belle] What for? Steve Klusky asked her on a date. What? I never heard anything about this. She didn't tell anyone, okay? You don't always have to know everything. She was just calling to ask me questions and wanting to know stuff. Dumb stuff. [sniffles] Like if the shoes she was wearing made her taller than him. She was freaking out. I just want to find Steph and I just want to see my mom. The taste of blood... [swallows, crunches] and broken teeth... [crunching] isn‘t that bad... [strained breath] compared to what she tastes like. [spits] [all screaming] No! No! No! Jamie! [all shouting at once] [crash] Oh, shit! It's in my eyes! l can't see. Get out! [Melanie] You guys okay? It's burning! Belle. It's burning! [whimpering] Caroline. Caroline, get up. It's time to get up now. Caroline-- Here. - Belle, let me. It's okay. - Ahh! - [Jamie yelps] - Caroline. Caroline, get up! Oh, God, she's going into shock! Caroline. Oh, God. [gunshot] - Help me! - Jamie? [wailing] Where's Jamie? Jamie! [Jamie crying] No, please stop! [Belle] Oh, God, help her! [Jamie wailing] Help! [woman shouting indistinctly] My baby! You bitch! You hurt my baby! [Belle] Come on! Get in the van! Come on! [Jamie crying] The lady shot me. Help me. I don't want to die. She shot me. I don't want to die. [Belle] Jamie, we're going to get you some help. You're going to be okay! [Melanie] Jamie, Jamie. I need you to push back here, okay? Jamie, come on. I can't see any light. Turn on the inside lights. - l can't see with these on. - Well, I need lights. Where's the flashlight? Give me the flashlight. - Here! - I need to tell you something. I won't bother you anymore if you help me. Caroline, get back here and hold this. - I don't want to die. - Here. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Jamie, I need you to stay still and put your feet up. [Caroline] Are we still looking for Stephanie? Caroline, Jamie needs our help. We need to worry about her right now, not Stephanie. [Jamie] Oh, God, this is the end, I know it. All right. First, you have to stop the bleeding. You have to put pressure on it. Right. Mel, don't let me die. Ja-- Jamie! We have to stop the bleeding! [screams] I need bandages. - Caroline! - What? - Bandages! - [Jamie stops crying] Jamie! Jamie, talk to me! Jamie, Jamie, Jamie. Talk to me. Come on, talk to me. Jesus. Melanie, there are no more fucking bandages. Caroline, come here. Keep her talking. Got to keep her awake. [Caroline] Jamie. Jamie. Jamie, wake up, okay? Jamie, baby, wake up. Talk to me, okay? Tell me about that time you fell off the parade ﬂoat. - What? - Jesus Christ, Melanie. I don't know what to fucking say. - You talk to her, then. - Oh, my God, what happened? Why am I bleeding? Why am I bleeding? What's all this blood? [crying] I don't wanna die. [Melanie] You're not gonna die. - I'm gonna fix you all up. - I don't wanna die. We have to cauterize, or whatever that word is. - We have to burn the wound. - Are you sure? [Caroline] Jamie, just stay right there, okay? Don't move. You have to stay there. And I promise-- I promise you, we're gonna get that crack whore for doing this, okay? [POPS] Look out. What are you doing? - This might hurt. - Please don't. Please don't. Please don't. - Here, bite down on this. - No. No. No. [crying] Close. [screaming] Let's not do that anymore. Give me the bandana. She needs a doctor. Well, if you see one, let me know. [yelping] [screaming] [tires screeching] Stephanie! Stephanie, it's okay. It's me. It's Caroline. [all shouting at once] We have to go. We have to go. We're gonna go away. You have to get in the van. You have to go in the van. Help me! Help me! I don't wanna-- I don't wanna go! [all shouting at once] We're gonna go home. - I don't want to go. - Keep her quiet. No, no, no, no. [Caroline] What's wrong with her? Why does she keep saying that? I think she's going into shock. [Jamie] What does that mean? It means she's repeating stuff. - Oh, God. - What? What's wrong with her? Don't-- Don't-- Don't look You'll go to hell if you look Don't look! You'll go to hell if you look Don't look. - Don't look Don't look - [crying] Belle! Find that bitch! What happened? Stephanie, I promise you. I'm going to let you hear the sweet sound of her face cracking when l smash it with a fucking brick! [panting] I feel-- I feel cold. Is there something we can stick on Jamie? Take my jacket. Bella, turn the heat on full blast. Don't make me go to hell. I don't want to. Please? Stephanie, stop saying that. You're not going to hell. How do we fix her? Oh, no. She ripped your pants. - Melanie, what do we do? - I don't know! Damn, we have to bandage her up. She's bleeding! We don't have anything. Here, help me get this off. Use my shirt. Stephanie, it's okay, okay? We're going to get you better. - Is she going to be okay? - Sure. Are you just saying that? I think she's gonna need a little more medical help than this shirt can provide. It's fine. Stop touching it. God, I've never seen this much blood before. Except for this one time when a girl fell off the jungle gym and said I helped her. Well, it was actually this one girl. She would not stop bothering me. So I climbed up on top of the monkey bars and I pushed her. She fell, and I got to watch the blood seep through her skull. But really... I saw her sitting underneath the monkey bars, and I went up with a chunk of concrete and smashed her head in! I got the teacher, and I told her she fell. I think she went blind in one eye. She didn't bother me after that. Ever. Or anyone else. Okay, that really concerns me. No, no, Caroline. Stay with me. Bella, the next time I see that bitch, l'm smashing her fucking face in! Wrong! We're not gonna see her again. This thing is gonna smash right through her fucking skull! And you know what I'm gonna do the next time I see her? I'm gonna beat her with it. I'm gonna beat her with it until her cranium cracks and I'm gonna watch the brains seep out from her fucking eye sockets! Steph, I'm sorry for everything that's happened. I couldn't move, I froze. [crying] I said to take the shortcut, and I told Belle to leave the wreck. Everything happened because of me. - That's not true. - It is. l can never make it up to you. l can never give back what was taken. Clay, we'll just keep taking this road and surely it'll end up somewhere like a town or someplace with people. And phones! We'll get help. Somehow we're gonna get out of this. Oh, God! Oh, God! We got to go! We got to go! She's coming for us! We got to get out of here. - We got to go! - It wasn't her. - What wasn't her? What do you see? - Drive it! Is she back there? I can't see anything! Go! We got to go! - She's coming! - Stephanie, stop it! You have to quit fighting us, okay? Stop. Listen to me. It wasn't her. It was a streetlight. You seriously saw a streetlight? No, it was her! She's coming! We got to go! You have to calm down. No, no! She's coming! Wait. We let all the air out of her tires. She can't get us. No, we didn't. We barely let any out. I'm trying to calm someone over here. - Aah! - Oh, God. - Aah! - You're gonna be fine, okay? - You're gonna be all right. Stop. - Aah! [tires squealing] - What are you doing? - Turning around. Streetlight's the closest thing to civilization that we've seen. Aah! Ow! Oh, God! Aah! God, get off! Get off! - [breathing erratically] - Get down! [whimpering] What is that? It's a ﬂat tire. Stop the van. We have to fix it. [crying] Stop the van. If you don't, you'll ruin the tire. We won't be able to go any farther. No, no, never leave the van. - You'll ruin the van! - Never leave the van. Stop it! You're just trying to jump out. No1 We never leave the van! No! No, don't go out there. Don't go out there. She'll get you! And if she gets you, she'll kill you. And if she kills you, you're dead. No more playing capture the flag at walk-ins, no more making out under the stairs with boys, no more dancing around your room. It's all gone. Oh, crap! Where's the spare? It's under the-- it should be right here. - It's under here. - All right. Get it out. You need to get back in the van. And you need to stay in the van. You need to stay in the van. She's coming! She's coming! Here, jack up the van. No, Caroline. Don't go. Please listen to me. Get out of the van. Now! Oh, please, please. Please don't go, please. - Stay in here. - No. Just stay in the van. Don't go out there. Please! What are you doing? Get to the other side, usually it's... Well, Jesus, Melanie, you didn't give me a chance to find it. - Here. - Here. - [door opening] - Aah! Steph, get out of the van. It can't handle your weight. No, I'm not leaving. No! - Come on. - It's okay. - No! - I'll stay with you. - Stop it, you're hurting-- - For God's sakes, get out of the damn van! - No. - Get-- [grunting] You have to listen to me. You have to get out of the van. No! No! No! Stop! - No, you stop it. - Aah! You're not making it any easier for us by freaking out like this. No! - [gunning engine] - Aah! [screaming] [Women whimpering] - Hurry! - Oh, ooh! Guys! Hurry! [screaming] - No! - [screaming] - Aah! - [door slams] - [gun clicking] - Ah, ah, Aah! Please! [screaming] [sobbing] I'm sorry for what I did. We can work through this. We can. Come on, darling, get your things-- [Women screaming] Why'd you do it? It wasn't fair! - [thudding] - [screaming] [shouting indistinctly] - [screaming, whimpering] - [sobbing] - [crying] - You're not wearing your seatbelt. [gasping, crying] [singsong] Seatbelts save lives. Let me go. Let me go. Please. No. Aah! [crying] Safety first. [breathing erratically, laughing] [gasping] Somebody please, help me! Please! - Help me! - [crying] - Somebody please! Help me, please! No, no, no, no. No. You can't do that. You can't do that! [sobbing] Leave me alone. - Little bitch. - Aah! [sobbing] l have tried to be nice. And l have tried to be understanding! [sobbing] I will not put up with your backtalk any longer! And I will not... tolerate this kind of behavior any longer! Do you understand me? If I tell you to jump, you ask how high! If I tell you to shit, you will squat and strain! Because as long as you are living under my roof, you will do what l say! [breathing erratically] [gasping, crying] [muffled screaming] You still want to keep acting like you do? You still want to talk back to me? l can't hear you. Please! Somebody, please! Unlock the door! Unlock it yourself! [screaming] What's wrong with you? [screaming] Help me! Aah! Ohh. Oh--ho--ho. No. No, please. No! Somebody help me. No. No, no! Don't do that. No, please, stop it. Get away from me! - No, stop it. - I'll give you something to cry about. Aah, ah, ah. No! No. No, please. No. Somebody help me. Aah, ah, ah. No. Please help me. - Get away from me! - Maybe daddy will help. - Get away! Get away from me! - You and your mom dissipated the world. - [tapping] - Open the door. - Open the door! - They shouldn't have let you do anything. - Open the door. - [electricity humming] Aah! Aah! [screaming] [grunting] You. Get away from them! [screaming] [whimpering] - Help me. - Here we are, sweet girl. - [crying] - You just need to be taught a lesson. Older men are not for you. - [screaming] - Specially my husband! You want to fuck something, you slut? Fuck this! [screaming] [screaming] [crying, gasping, screaming] - [thud] - Aah! [screaming] Let go of me! My family! They need me! They-- Aah! [gasping, moaning] Please. [gasping] It's my anniversary. Please, let me go home to my husband.

She gunned them all down. Well, I guess that's it. [Isabella] Seatbelts. Oh, is that the same store? - No way. - Did we just go in a big-ass circle? - [gasping] - What's wrong? They're dead. She killed everyone. [gasping] The clerk. The old man at the counter. They're all dead. There's blood everywhere. What about a phone? Is there a phone? God. She shot every fucking thing!
