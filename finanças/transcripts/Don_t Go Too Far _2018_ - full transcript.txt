- Do you want to go get a snack? - Sure. Don't go too far. (CHAPTER 1. THE INHERITANCE) As you all know, we will have to get ready to let him go. At least father didn't suffer from dementia or other sicknesses. So let's not to be so sad. Father! And we should stay with him until father is at ease. I also called the notary public. As I said, When father was in good health, he wrote a will, and we'll make it official right here today. Hey Hun-gyu, how are the legal processes going? I thought you went to court last week. Are you still on the case? She has to divorce you, huh? Hey! This is not your business! Do not bother! Your problem is also my problem. We are family! Don't worry! I know what I am doing! Well, then stop asking me for a ride to court! Take a bus! Hun-gyu, just tell her you were wrong before. What have I done wrong? Things happen when you get married. You can not beat your wife! It wasn't even a one time thing! It was her fault! Dramatic wench! You can't call your wife a wench. Seriously, drinking? He never grows up! Even after his license got cancelled. How is work going, Jo? I just work hard. So you stopped studying now? 8 years are enough. He can't spend his entire life on it. But he has been studying so hard. It can be a waste of time... But that's life. Well, if you have to sell insurance to people. You need a sense of humor to get their attention. I'm sorry for you. Hey, sis, don't worry about it. We are doing just fine. How about you Hun-goo, how is your sock factory going? It's just fine. Sure, it's going well! He received a certificate for his contribution to the local youth employment. Hey, how about you? Nothing special. What about Yoon-sung? He is in the library studying for his midterm exam. He seems to be studying hard. Right, he was born with a smart head. What about the time he beat up a kid? How did that go? What is wrong with you? I was just curious. Hello. Please come in. Honey! He wrote this letter two months ago. And I have kept it since then. To start off I will first read his letter. Dear my lovely first son Jung Hun-goo, second Jung Hun-chul, third Jung Hun-gyu and, my youngest Jung Eun-hye. If you all are reading this letter I might not be here anymore. But don't be too sad. Everybody dies one day and it's a very natural thing. I am just going to another world earlier than you guys. By the end of my life, I realized human life is truly mystical. It was a pleasure to look back and learn from the past to pioneer the rest of my life. From all my lessons from life, I have lots of things to say just like sand in the ocean. But I think it's also your mission to find out and learn from your own life. So I will ask you one favor and finish this letter. Do not argue and help each other to live together for the Jung family. This is about the inheritance. Mr. Jung has $2 million in assets and you will inherit it as follows. The first son gets $900K. The second son gets $300K. The third son $300K. And the youngest gets $300K. The remaining $200K, goes to the church. Only $900K... Big brother gets $900K. Isn't that unfair...? Did father really write this? Yes, he wrote it. No, I mean. Are you sure if he wrote letter when he still had his own mind? Not because my big brother told him what to write? Hey, you'd better think before you speak. What? I can't even ask? Bro and sis! Don't you guys want to know the truth? I can ask instead of you guys. I think you're drunk. Why does big brother get more than us? Only $300K for each of us and $200K to the church? How crazy! Crazy? You cannot talk like that! Isn't that the big church where big bro is an elder? I heard the church has more than 10,000 members. Then the pastor sure knows a lot of investors too, right? What a coincidence! So you're saying... I am not buying it! Who is calling? So you're saying, my husband forced him to write the will? Who knows! Why are you so rude! I mean, it's just so ridiculous! When mom died and father was alone, did big brother take care of father? Who said we should take turns taking care of father? It was him, our big brother! And who disagreed with it? That's you two! Second bro and sis! You guys said, you don't want to take care of father. Big brother should be responsible since he's the first son. I remember the faces you guys made when we talked about this crap! How funny! It was only a few months ago! I know no one is happy with the inheritance. Do you think our sister in law will be happy with only $900K? Since father collapsed, she sure thought he'd die soon. But what a surprise, he stayed alive for 6 months more. Guess who must have felt so anxious? Watch out when you talk to your sister in law! Second bro and Eun-hye! What did you say to me on the phone? You said it was so blatant for him to take care of father after he had collapsed. Crap! I am not saying this because of the money! Isn't this what you wanted from me? Making a mess? Hey bro, cut it out! Hello? You'd better listen to me carefully. - No kidding. - Hey! Have you lost your mind? - I'm good thanks. - Don't hang up you idiot! I did kidnap your kid! Jackass! - What? Kidnapped...? - Yeah, you damn moron! That's why you have to listen when someone's talking on a phone! Cutting me off? You pissed me off! Who are you? What do you think ass, I'm the one who has your goddamn kid. What? You better stop this. Damn! Joke? You better think clear before your kid dies. Okay, I got this. Please calm down. I won't say it twice! Prepare $2M in 24 hours... $2M? Ass! Stop cutting me off! I'm really sorry. Jackass, do not cut me off while I am talking to you! - Got it? - Sorry I won't. If you don't have $2M by tomorrow, I will throw your kid in the river. Okay, I got it! Please don't hurt my kid. Don't think about calling cops! Then your kid dies, got it? Okay! And you better answer the phone right away, dumb-ass! Hello? Hey! Hey! Honey... What happened? What's going on? Where is Jin-ho? You gave him some cash to buy snacks. So that we can talk privately about the inheritance. What was it? What you mean, $2M? Big bro, is there any problem? What's going on? My son... He got kidnapped. Sis, is Jin-ho not answering? What about Seo-han? Call her! She doesn't have a cell phone yet. But, is it really a kidnapping call? Maybe just voice phishing? I heard fraudsters are scamming elderly these days, or not? Are you sure Jin-ho got kidnapped? What about Seo-han? He calls my home and says he has my kid! It can be only my boy. How can it be your daughter? Don't you think we should call the cops? No cops! Big bro! We have to call them. Right, bro? He said he will kill my boy if I call the cops. If you call the cops, kids never come back! Don't you read newspaper? Cops don't care about the kids! They just want to improve their record for the job! Then what should we do? Hey bro, it will be fine. Don't worry. Yeah, bro. It will be okay. You all know how hard it was to have Jin-Ho, my son. You all know, right? The most important thing is my son's safety, he is the eldest grandchild of the Jung family! Of course! It's Jin-ho's safety first! As long as he comes back to us safely, we can do anything! Right, bro. If the kidnapper calls again, let's ask him to let Jin-ho go. Sir. Could we have the inherited $2M in cash right now? Wait, our father's inheritance? I have to prepare the money for the kidnapper! But... Money is not the important thing here! The most important thing is the life of Jung family's eldest grandson. Sir, could you please... Bro.. I understand your situation, but you can't just take it without our permission. What permission? Anyone would do this. I mean the way you put, its just not fair. The whole money is not yours! Stop talking about whose money it is! Your nephew just got kidnapped! Okay, I totally understand you are going through a hard time... But the idea of using dad's inheritance without even asking... Did I say something wrong? Don't you all agree? Damn! It's your nephew's life, you are talking about! You think it's sane to talk about the inheritance now? I'm just so disgusted that we came from the same mother! Don't get emotional. Don't you have any savings? Damn you! Hey, Jin-ho! (CHAPTER 2. $2 MILLION) How come...? How can you misunderstand...? He called our house and said he has our kid so obviously we thought it's our son. Well at least Jin-ho came back safe. Sis! Like I said I think it's voice phishing. But the kidnapper said he took the kid. But Jin-ho came back. While my kid hasn't. If we make a reasonable guess, we don't have to conclude that she got kidnapped just because of one call. Maybe Seo-han got lost. I'm just wondering, have you checked outside? You don't have a kid so you can easily say that. I'm so sorry... I didn't mean it that way. But if we are lucky enough... If the kidnapper realizes that he kidnapped the wrong kid, maybe he will let her go, wouldn't he? Look! There is no reason to keep the wrong child. It's the wrong kid from other people. I mean, it's not the totally wrong kid. It's our niece anyway. But the kidnapper doesn't have to know. If I tell the kidnapper that the kid is not mine and I have no reason to give money to him anymore, then who knows. He might just give up? Also Seo-han doesn't have a cell, so he wouldn't know who to call for money. Despite all that, if he keeps asking for money, then what? We should say she is not my daughter and we don't know that kid. Do you think he is going to give up that easily? If I were a kidnapper I would threaten to kill the kid. Even if you say she's not your kid and can't send the money. What's point of threatening me, if she's not my daughter? In the past, there were a lot of kidnappings but these days if people see that on the news, they would try to execute him. And I bet the kidnapper knows that too. If I were the kidnapper, there is no reason to keep the kid alive and I would just damn kill her. What is wrong with you? Stop it. I'm just saying this kidnapper will not think like normal people. I am telling you the truth! Then we should call the cops! God damn it! No cops! Hey! Hey! - Hello. - Pick up the god damn phone! I don't know who you are. I'm the damn kidnapper! Whoever the kid is, that is not my child. - What? - We didn't call the cops yet, so please let her go. We won't make any issue. Hey! Um... Um... Damn! I don't care! Bring me the money! Or I will kill this kid! Do you think I can't do it? I am a pro! I'm saying that is not my kid! - Why are you asking me for money? - I don't care! $2M is not like a piece of paper. No matter what, we are not giving you that money! - Hey! Hey! - Sir! Please. I need to know if my kid is safe. Then we can give you the money. What is your cell number? It's 010-2400-9653. Check it! Make $2M, if you don't want to see the kid die. Hello? Let's spend father's inheritance right now! Hun-goo, like you said! Safety comes first, not the money! Sir, can we get the inheritance in cash right now? Please, help us... Bro... You should not try to use our inheritance... Why not? As I said... Why do you guys trying to use it without discussing with us? Then what can we do? Don't we have to keep our niece safe first? What is a family? As a family, we should help each other in difficult times. I know, I understand but this is too unilateral. So what? Goddamn. What you want now? Well? we should be more careful with the inheritance. Oh my God. Your goddamn niece is kidnapped! And you talk like you don't even know her! Do you think you are the only one that has a hard time now? Look! Look at this! My husband brought insurance papers even when gathered for our dying father! Can't you see how we are doing? Hey sis! You told me earlier my husband is a really shy person, didn't you? God damn you are right! So when such person visited you to ask for one insurance policy, were there anybody here who signed up for him? Don't remember what you all said? Hun-goo, you said you already have all the insurance you need. And you, Hun-chul? You won't get cancer, as you smoke e-cigarettes? Then why would Hun-gyu get Uterine cancer insurance unless he is crazy? I didn't know... you had a hard time. You guys have always been so selfish! Have you two ever care about Hun-gyu and me? I'm sorry. And! If you really need money to save your child, you first have to use up whatever you have. After that, if you still need extra money then you should ask for help! You don't just spend father's inheritance all to yourself! You are still the selfish man you were before! We are not living under the same roof anymore! You didn't even care how your sister and brother were doing, How can you only care about yourself? Why do I always have to be the one to give up? I've got nothing to say... It's a matter of your niece's life and death. Coud you help just this once? If you need help, ask big brother! He's got the biggest part. What? We didn't get much! You got the half! Bro! Bro! Please help. Let's use the money. When you thought Jin-ho was kidnapped you said you can do anything for him. Please we are both fathers... You know how I feel. Well... It happened too suddenly... I wasn't thinking right. Even she got kidnapped, she might be safe.. What the heck are you talking about? - I mean... - Bro, you care about her so much! She may be murdered by the kidnapper! Bro, you have to say something! If you agree, everyone will too! Brother! Please help! I know, but... Now it's... Our father worked hard to make this money... We can't give it away that easily to the kidnapper... Bro... We should think rationally. Damn! Do you think you can be goddamn rational here? I know but you have to calm down and think more rationally... - We should call the cops. - Damn! No police! What the heck? What the heck is this? Just give him the money! This is goddamn crap! Our niece is kidnapped and you are fighting over the money? Damn you, Hun-goo! You wanted to use the inheritance either. Now it's not about your kid and you change your mind like that? Hey, it's not like that. Well... he didn't say about the business, but our sock factory is having a hard time too. I thought we can finally take breath with the inheritance. But, if we give the money to the kidnapper, we will be thrown on the street... And it's not only our family. We hired a bunch of young workers because of the national policy. What about those workers? I also have a kid, so I understand... But we can't all die because of one child. Seriously? How could you talk to me like that? I don't want to talk to you like that... I also have a heart like you people. Every time blaming the sock factory! I'm sick of this! You just can't stop talking about that crap. That crap? Correct! You have always been saying how serious your business is and that it's a national project. As if you are running a semiconductor factory or else! Stop it! Stop for what? Because it's not your son who got kidnapped? Damn it! Father would be super happy with this! Father? You are right! You know how contradictory it is for you to worry about father? Guess who had been giving the hardest time for him? You said your wife was too dramatic? Who can not be dramatic when her husband is cheating on her? What does that have to do with all this! I am saying, everybody has their own problems. But you act like you are the only kind person here. That's enough! Isn't it really odd? Why did the kidnapper pick this very day? He asked for exactly $2M... And how did he find out our telephone number? Exactly $2M on the day of the reading of father's will. Like someone already knew this was happening. What are you talking about? As an insurance agent, I am just having a reasonable doubt. What the heck are you saying? A reasonable doubt? Come on, people say the kidnapper is often a person around you, right? You jackass! You are telling me that I made it all up? I'm trying hard to get my kid back and you talk crap about me? It was just a doubt. Why are you so mad at me! Hey you jerk! You piss me off! You wouldn't talk like that if it were your child. See that's why you can't make a baby, cuz you are always messing up with everything. Hey! How dare you.. What? I can't take all these personal insults from you. What, you goddamn ass? Well, let me ask you then. Did you ever treat me as a part of this family? You never liked me since I came here to get permission to get married, didn't you? You looked down on me. Because I didn't come from a nice background nor did I have enough money and work experience. Am I wrong? When I heard you saying Eun-hye can't marry the poor jerk who can't even afford a house, do you have any idea how it made me feel? And now suddenly I am your family and you try to take my money? In this dark night? It's absurd! Even if you are on your knees and beg me for the money, I don't even know if I want to help you. What you scumbag? You never shut up about money and I can't talk about it? Huh? - Say it! - You better shut your mouth! Hey, please! Stop! I never mentioned this, but I am a precious child to somebody! You got that? You damn idiot! Come over here, scumbag! Yeah! Suit yourself! Jo, you took it too far. How can you say he made it all up? What! He started it first! We've been wrong. It's all our fault. Everything we've done wittingly and unwittingly, it's all our bad. We sincerely apologize for what we did in the past. I am not asking you to forgive our family. You can hate us. But please... Please don't hate my daughter. Her life is at stake and it all depends on you. If you help us, just this once, we will never forget it and repay you for your kindness for the rest of our life. Please, help us. If you agree to help us, the others will follow you. Please, help us. Eun-hye, I am sorry for being so selfish. I am really sorry. I was so mean to you guys. I am meaner than my husband. We have been so mean to you. What the heck are you doing? Stop! Please help my child! Sit down and shut up! What the heck! What is this? Just give them the money! Are we seriously arguing over money, when our niece's life is at stake? $50K! That is my notarial fee. What? As I said your father left $1.8M to his family. It doesn't matter how you guys agree to use that money. The problem is the $200K. It's legally assigned to church. So, instead of giving away $200K to the church, you would be better off if you give me $50K. Sir, what are you talking about? I've to make sure the inheritance is used in the way your father wants it. You are insane. Are you goddamn threatening us? Anyways I am just telling you, you can use only $1.8M, not $2M. What the heck is your problem? My daughter is going to die! It is your father's decision. Of course he didn't know all this would happen. Cut it off! If he were here, he would spend all his money for his granddaughter! Do you really think you know him well? What? Is there anybody that really knows what kind of person he is? Have you lost your mind? Don't you remember all the things our farther has done for you? What? What has he done for me? Do you ever know how he could make this $2M? Yeah, he worked hard to make that money! Yeah right, he did. But how did he keep it? Tax evasion, a slush fund, embezzlement... I was the one who had to clean up the crap! What? If someone helps you, you should pass it on. I know people like your father. If he was to spend $2M on saving your child, I'm willing to be buried instead of your dead father. You jackass! Back off! Get out, right now! I was going to leave anyway. You people are just like your father! Even when your child is kidnapped, all you care is... Get out! Right now! I was going to ask $200K, but just said $50K, because of your poor kid! You jerk! You! goddamn jackass! What are you doing? We need every single penny. And you are trying to steal it? Crazy ass! I will cut your limbs off! - Stop it! - Put that down! Ha, blood will tell. You are just like your father. Scumbag! If something happens to my kid, you better get ready to die. - Bro! Stop it! - Please, don't do that! Eun-hye, what's wrong? Oh my god! My baby! Honey! Honey, are you okay? How could he... You did a good job until now. But we cannot give up the money. No matter what! Okay? From now on, got it? Please Eun-hye... I've got nothing! What about our life after giving the money to the kidnapper? We might live on the streets anytime. You hear me? Answer me! Why you didn't tell me that you are pregnant? We lost a baby twice... We wanted to be careful this time. We were going to let people know after 3 months. I am sorry for what I said earlier. I should have been more mature. I shouldn't have acted like a ass. We should look after each other. Honey, I'm just gonna go to the bathroom. Are you okay? Now? After all this? Goddamn full of crap. I've been holding out for so long. Give me one. Keep it a secret from my wife. I don't have to live longer. I am terribly sorry that you had to see all that. Don't worry about it. I am also part of your family. You may think it's pathetic. But the truth is that we all just want to live. Right. I understand. Sometimes people say stuff even though they don't mean it. Right. Congratulations on Eun-hye's pregnancy. Yeah, thanks. And give me some suggestions for good insurance to sign. - Okay. - Take a seat. - Come here. - Okay. Have a drink. (CHAPTER 3. AN UNINVITED GUEST) I will pay my part of the inheritance. I won't force you to do the same. She will understand. It just takes time. I also don't need the inheritance. We have to save our niece first. Me too. Thank you so much. - Thank you all of you. - Thank you. I don't think we can get $2M in cash by tomorrow. I spoke to the bank and we can get a loan with the inheritance as collateral. I am so sorry to put you through all this. You don't need to say sorry to your family, bro. He's right. From now on, let's only think about Seo-han's safety. Hang in there, bro. Jo, can you get the door? Hello sir. Close the curtain! Curtain! The criminal may see us from outside! Who is Jung Hun-chul? Yes, that is me. I am detective Yoon, and in charge of kidnapping cases. We three discussed and decided to call the cops. We should catch the criminal and get our money back safely. Don't worry. Your daughter's safety comes first. Thank you in advance. No... Why! Why did you call the police? Goddamn why? Damn! What is going on? Why the heck did you call police! Damn! I said no cops! No cops for fool's sake! You want my daughther die? Do you? Why the heck did you call the police! Honey! - Hun-chul! - Honey! - Hey! Hey! - Bro! (8 HOURS AGO) Alright. Nice work. - It's not easy right? - Yes. You got much better though. It will get better. Let's take a 10minute break and we'll continue. Yes. Look who's here. Look at all the hot girls here. I should join the class, too. What have you done with your hair? Come over here! Did you find someone to pick up the stuff? Yep. What did you say? I just told him it's a shopping mall delivery. I'd give him $100 and he said he'd do it. But, what if they call the cops? I'll make sure they don't call the cops! Hey, look at this. This a good sign! (KIDNAPPED 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL FOUND DEAD) God's helping us. I will make a big fuss about it, so they won't call them. Yoon Sung, do not use your cell phone no matter what! And we are not talking on the phone from now. Use the telephone box. If you get a call, do not answer! - Got it? - Got it. How are you going to disguise your voice? I kidnapped your daughter, scumbag! Scumbag? What did you say to your father? Have you forgotten that I am the kidnapper? Yeah. You're right. But, how are you going to answer the phone in uncle's house? Well... it doesn't really matter even if Hun-goo answers it. What if he says it is not his child? Why would he do that, dumb-ass! It is his precious niece anyway. If he is trying to talk, I'll snatch the phone from him. Now you know how to use your brain. Then just do as you said. And you! Don't tell your sister about it. Tell her it's just a joke. - She shouldn't know all this. - Got it. Where did I say is the final place? - At the Jinyang Market. - Where exactly? Holy crap. How many times are you asking! The main gate escalator at 2 o'clock - With a hoodie and red cap! - Shh! How many times are you asking. You better watch your language! But, why can't I just do it? You know your uncle Hun-gyoo, he might try to follow us. I am more worried about the greey and selfish Jung family. Would they really give up their $2M? It's their niece. They wouldn't mess up with her life. I think they sure can. I am so sick of them. What the heck did you say? Stop talking crap about my family! Back off if you don't want to do. I will use the $2M on my own! I never said I didn't want to do it. And work on your acting! It's been a month. I don't want to waste my money! As if you are so good at it! You guys are both the same. Let's start the class! Listen! It's tonight! We are not hurting anyone, and we are not kidnapping someone else's kid. So don't feel guilty about this. Who are we doing this for? - Family. - Family. Yes! It's for the goddamn family. Did you check the security cameras? We are working on it. So did you get anything? Nothing special so far. Captain, I think the kidnapper knows this area really well. Okay, focus on security cameras within a 5km radius of the house. We asked the local patrol unit for cooperation. Okay, got it! Father! Dad! He passed away while we were arguing. - Father, wake up! - Dad! I'll be good to you. Father! Hun-chul, I think you were so stressed out. You fainted and and kept sleeping without waking up once. Your wife couldn't handle, so the cops took her to the hospital with Jin-ho. Okay. Don't worry about the funeral. We will take care of it. Just focus on Seo-han's safety. Detective, what are the chances of our niece coming back if we pay him? If you pay him, she'll be back 100%. We can't be 100% sure. But we've got to believe she will come back safely. The rule is to save the kid first then catch the kidnapper. I mean, if you were the kidnapper... After getting what you want, would you still kill the kid? Yeah, if the criminal is reasonable, he wouldn't do anything risky. Right, if we give him the money... We can't say anything for sure, it's too risky to assume anything based on rationality. Any call from the kidnapper yet? Not yet. Usually kidnappers are impatient, so they would call often which makes it easier for us to catch him. But this guy has not called for a while... I think he is very calm and professional. What a professional jerk. - Is the line being tapped? - Of course. - And you can track him? - Absolutely. But the criminals are smart enough to keep the calls short. If you want to track them, we need to keep the call for at least 1minute. I see. Is there anybody who wants revenge on you? No. Then is there anyone else who knows that you'll be here today? No. I also suddenly got the call from my big brother today. How about the others? Is there anybody who knows that you are discussing about your father's inheritance here today? Nobody, except the Notary Public. - I didn't tell anyone. - Me neither. I told my mom. So it's only him and your mom who know about it? I think it is not the notary public. Why is that? - That ass is... - He was very close to my father. Wait, did anything happen between you and him? - No, it's not that... - You can tell me. Small things could end up as bigger problems. Tell me what happened. That person demanded $50K! $200K were left for the church donation, so he asked for $50K in return for keeping silent. - So he blackmailed you. - That's right. Such a piece of crap! I got it. We can deal with that. But if he opens his mouth, we will have to pay the church. The money is going to the kidnapper anyway. Who cares if he gets $50K or the church gets $200K? The kidnapper asked for $2M! We will talk to the church. I am sure the pastor would not take the money in such situation. You said your mother knows about the inheritance? Yes, but why... My mother is not a suspect! Honey! How is your mother's financial status these days? Why are you asking? It is just a cursory question. Are you suspecting my mom? I can not believe you are suspecting my mother-in-law. No matter how crazy the world is, who in the right mind would kidnap their own family? - Right! - Calm down. 70% of kidnappings are committed by the people around you. We asked these questions to narrow down the suspects and find the kidnapper. Even the smallest things help us to figure out who the kidnapper is. And... If you can bargain, that'd be helpful too. Maybe we can tell him that... Hey! This is not like a supermarket shopping! I'm just saying, we could at least try. Don't you think it is unfair? I mean it's not only for my own sake. To get what we can... It's the kidnapper. Keep him on the phone as long as possible! Hello. You didn't call the cops? No, I didn't. Good job! Now, let's prepare $2M all in cash. Please, let the kid go. And let's stop this. What the heck? Let's stop this, please! You think I'm an idiot? Shut up and get your ass to Janghanpyung Street 23 by noon! Answer my call in the phone booth. I will give you the next order. Hey! Don't make it a big deal and stop it for fool's sake! What the heck did you just say? Scumbag! I'll cut your goddamn kid to pieces! You better come alone, or I'll damn kill her. You goddamn brainless stupid ass... The call is from Kangdong district. We could've more accurate location if the call were a bit longer. Too bad. Damn, this jerk can swear. How many years do you get for kidnapping? Depends on the case, but usually around 15 years. Only 15 years? Let's get that jerk and burn him to death! What a trash. He told me to come alone. I have to go alone. Yes you will. And we will keep our distance to follow you. I have to go alone! They are professionals! My kid is in danger! Don't worry about it! He won't recognize us. How can you be so sure? Don't worry! The cops are professionals too! Hun-chul, they will certainly do well. We have to catch him to get the money back. It's still... Don't worry, we all have over 10 years of experience in this field. We run a legitimate operation. You just need to get your orders from the kidnapper, and follow what he says. You can leave the rest to us and we will deal with it. And once you pass over the money, don't follow the criminal or attack him. Whatever you do, don't piss him off. We don't even know how many kidnappers there are. We will make sure your daughter is safe, and then we will catch them. Please detective, save my niece and help us get our money back. Okay. Hey let's trust the cops, don't worry too much. Let's go. Just a second, I have to see father. - Let's get ready. - Yep. Tell the backup team to come straight to the scene. Yes, sir! The person you are trying to reach isn't available... God, answer the goddamn phone. You're driving me crazy. Should I try eavesdropping? Bro! If father was alive, he would have saved her too. Sir, is there any other way to catch the kidnapper, without giving the money away? Right, money isn't always the only way. The kidnapper wants the money, there is no other way we can do. There must be another way... It's our father's precious inheritance. Don't worry about the money. Money is important but our niece is more important. - But... - What's the matter? The cops will back you up. Don't worry. No matter how smart the kidnappers are, we have the GPS to track you. We won't lose you even a second. What about father's funeral...? Leave it up to us. You just need to care about your daughter for now. - Get ready! - Yes! We don't have much time. We don't want to piss them off. - But... - Please raise your arm - I just... - We will attach the tracker. Bro, are you really sure? Don't worry about us. But I have to be at the funeral... We'll handle it, bro. This is a wireless earphone that works within 5km. It's as tiny as no one will notice even if you put it on. - Can you see it? - No. Local police officers in disguise will follow you wherever you go. Let's go now. We don't have much time. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. Let's go, sir. It will be fine, bro. Don't worry too much. The rest of you, please stay away from the door. Team 1 back up. Team 2, you're on it. Let's go. We're moving. Get ready. It'll be okay! Don't get too nervous! You got this, bro! This is father's inheritance. Bring her back safely. I'm totally screwed. (CHAPTER 4. DON'T GO TOO FAR) God damn! You crazy prick! We just arrived at the phone booth. Hold your position and keep your eyes open. Yes, sir! He's talking with the kidnapper. He's heading to the next place. He got out of the phone booth and keeps walking around for 30 minutes. Nothing special yet. Okay, keep your eyes on him. Yes, sir. He starts running! What? Who is running? Officer Lee? Hey, who is following him? Stop! Stop! Officer Choi got on. Officer Choi, which way is the bus going? It's Bus 532, Jongro direction. What? Towards Jongro? Okay, check who else is inside the bus. Copy that. The kidnapper could be inside the bus, so get ready for it. We'll follow right behind. Yes, sir! Driver! Open the door! He is getting off at the publisher street. What? Stop the car! I am on him. Hurry up, go get him! This way. Wow, these guys are well-organized. I can't even think straight. These goddamn pricks... this looks really professional. Get out of the way! I'll go this way, you go that way. Okay. Damn! - Captain, we lost him. - What? We are looking for him, but we can't spot him yet. We will continue searching. Check inside the building. Let's go. I think the father is weird. From now on, we go after the father. You guys go that way, we'll go this way! Hello, come in. Excuse me. I am in a hurry so... Could you change your clothes with me? I will pay you. - All this money? - Yes. Don't change your mind, I already took off my clothes. No, I won't. Thank you so much. Why in such hurry? And this hat too. Oh, okay. Have a glass of water. (3 HOURS AGO) (DAD) God damn! Why is he calling? I should not answer him! He's probably gonna mad at me if I pick up. Damn, it's annoying. Hi, ass! Here I am. What jackass! Hey ass, what the heck is going on? Just do it dumb-ass. It's $100. Or I'll ask somebody else. You think I'm an idiot? Why the heck should I wear a red cap and a hoodie for picking up delivery? Damn! Stop asking so many questions. Just do it for fool's sake! I just don't feel right. Jerk. Goddamn tell me what is it? Crap! Stop asking questions! Curious idiot! No Crap. I'm not gonna do this! - Okay, okay! Come here. - Goddamn fraud! See, now you tell me. You ridiculously curious prick! - Don't tell anybody. - Okay, I won't. What do you think? Isn't that cool? Are you nuts? You're unbelievably insane. Why? You just need to follow the directions. What damn directions? Crazy prick! You said you will goddamn do it. Cut off! I am not doing this crap! Scumbag, who cares? Damn it! I will do it myself. (JINYANG MARKET) Captain! He left his clothes - and the bug in the shop. - Leave what? He changed his clothes. A beige jacket with a hat. And he should be heading towards Chungmuro. Okay got it! Let's head to Chungmuro! Damn! What the heck... Team B, it's Jinyang Market. You guys go over there and we will go this way. No way! No! We got him! This way! What should I... Holy crap! Damn! Damn! Damn! (Don't Go Too Far)
