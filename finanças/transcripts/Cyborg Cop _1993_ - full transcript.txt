Jack, over here! Hurry! - Right here, little brother. What's this jerk-off want? I told you! i want my mommy, or i'll blow her fucking head off! Mommy! - O.k. just hold on. We'll get your mommy. Don't patronize me! I hate that! I know what you've been doing with your secretary, dad. Thinks i'm his father. - She's gonna die right now if you don't bring mom here! I want to kill her! How did he get the vest? Shot borden. He thinks he's henrietta carmichael's kid... The newspaper family. - Don't talk about my mother! I want my mommy! I'll blow her head off! I can't get a clean shot. You'd better get the shrink. This guy ain't coming out for nobody but his mommy. She's been dead five years. - Mommy! Come on. Mommy! I got a body shot. Mommy! Don't. you're not authorized. You're already on callan's list. 10 seconds, and then this whore dies! Let the swat team take him. They're legal on that stuff. Now! Jack, damn it! Don't do it! You know the regs! Jack! Phillip! No. He is the carmichael kid. You're gonna burn for this, jack. Well, he would have burned her and you. Follow me. come on. Let's have some pictures. Excuse me, officer. Who's the guy that's shot? Get a close-up of him and his partner and the girl. Frankie, what's with that magazine? You haven't said three words since we picked you up. I can't be a good architect without it, and actually, i've said 38 words, not counting these, phillip. Well, sorry i lost track. Can i have the usual? Sure. Hey, wally. Can we get a coke, root beer, milk, with a cherry for the little man here. You really like that junk? It's different. I can't stick around too much longer. Will you be o.k. while we shoot some pool and talk big guy talk? Sure. He's something else. Yeah. So you're doing it? Yeah. the papers should be in when i get back, and then, he's officially my kid. Get back from where? The caribbean... saint... saint something. There's a guy down there who's trafficking "h" through the islands. Like he buys it raw in the triangle then ships it in? Then processes it there and ships it here. It sounds weak to me, but the word is, he's bringing in close to 100 million on the street. Yeah. Watch yourself. Get someone you can trust as your backup. Is that an offer? No. Well, that's too bad. This job was more fun when you and i were the famous double trouble psycho cops, taking out the bad guys. I'm sorry. it's just not in the cards. Keith. St. keith, that's it. You're kidding. It's as stable as a two-legged milk stool. Anyway... see frankie once or twice, will you? Tell him i'm in chicago. Chicago. Great. Chicago it is. Just crossing the coastline... st. Keith. O.k., guys. Cut them down. Come back alive, and the drinks are on me. That will be the day. Take your positions. Red alpha, this is home base. You're visual. Copy? over. Reading you. Copy. over. We've got enough fuel for three hours. I'm at 11:00, ready to roll. Over and out. Go! go! Halt... down. What the hell is that? Maybe it's a kid. Let's go. Right. Tell the men to wait for my signal. Sure. What will it be? They'll know it. O.k. This will be like taking candy from small children. Let's go. Spread yourselves out. Over there. Keep your heads down. Come on. Move yourselves! Get up there. Get out of sight. Cover the rear. Get out of sight, everybody! That's strange. He's usually got guards out. Could be their day off. Yeah, right. O.k. let's move. This is the bit i like. Now watch this. Ha ha ha! Shit. It's a goddamn setup! Abort! abort! Now, i need a survivor. Let's go! let's go! Johnny, let's move! Johnny! Johnny, let's move! Come on! Quincy, come here. Bring him to me. Can you tie it off? Red alpha, mayday. mayday. Red alpha, acknowledge. We need immediate evacuation. Come in. over. Red alpha, are you there? We're in sector alpha 10. Hurry. I copy. Hang in there. Will do. over. Let's go back and get them. We're coming back. He's got a vest on. A nightmare? Are you o.k.? Yeah. Go back to sleep, sandy. My name is cindy, not sandy. Whatever. He's fading on us, doctor. Give me the b-41. Hurry! Prepare for advanced temperature reduction. Now. It's ready. Let's do it. Minus 5 degrees. Minus 30 degrees. Minus 60, holding. Maintain. Pulse steady. Now. Well done, dr. stechman. Well done, man. Hey, jack. I knew you'd find this. Listen. this thing stinks down here. I don't know why. I think your bad feeling was right for once. Look. i know how you feel about the agency, but if you're listening to this, it means i need help. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't big-league stuff, so pick up my trail at the hotel and don't tell anyone. Give frankie the toy. I got to go. I'll see you. Callan. Where's my brother? You know the routine, ryan. It's confidential. Where is he? I won't stop until you tell me where. Meet me at al's. 8:00. 8:00. Why didn't he call? They have phones in chicago. Frankie. He's in trouble, isn't he? You can tell me. I don't know. That's what i'm going to find out. But he's tough. He'll be o.k. if something happens, i won't have a place to live. He told you about the adoption? Yeah, but i had a scary feeling something might happen, you know, again, like my real parents. Let me tell you something about my little brother. He's never let me down. He won't let you down either. O.k.? But what if it's something he can't help? Then we'll have to make a plan. We'll do that. Together. Yeah, together. O.k. Don't you worry, either. It will work out. That's what phillip says. And he's usually right. You'd better get to class. I'll call you when i know something. O.k., and be careful, o.k.? Run. Bye, jack. Jesus. Phillip, you'd better be o.k., you son of a bitch. What are you doing these days, wasting your life away? Let's cut the same old shit. Talk about phillip's mission. O.k. I'm listening. We were set up... Some political thing. We still don't know what happened. One minute, everything's fine. The next, phil's asking for evac and being hit. We go back in, but i'm too late. We pulled out. And you left him? Come on, jack. You son of a bitch! Touch me, and i'll snap his neck. Back off. He means it. I told him you bastards wouldn't cover him if it got hot. Hot? jesus, jack, give me a break. I had 2 $6-million choppers. Equipment is replaceable! With a pilot in each. That's three lives. You know the regs. Don't break rules to save lives. And cost three more? No, we wouldn't. You would have done the same if you'd been any kind of leader. What i know, callan, is that my brother, your best friend, called for your help, and you deserted him! For all i knew, they were dead. Then you get the body. In a fire fight? In a fucking nuclear war if it's phillip! You are a psycho. I got the old man on my back. You know what that's like. The last time, you did. You just ran, didn't you? You don't have to worry about being on my list because you don't even exist. You're just a bad memory, like every other memory i got of this business. Stay out of this, ryan. We don't play around with screwed-up ex-agents! Don't fuck with us. Caribbean airways announces the arrival of their flight ca-125 from miami. Mr. kessel's residence. A call for you, sir. Thank you. You're welcome, sir. Kessel here. Immigration here. Phillip ryan's brother has just landed. He says he's on vacation. Well, that's very interesting. Yeah. he's going to the car rental. Hang it up, michael. Yes, sir. It's my pleasure. Jesus christ! Look where you're going! Are you blind or stupid? I would say i'm sorry, but if you're going to be that way... Well, i am. These aren't toys. You're a reporter? For a carmichael paper. Yeah. no cheap newspaper lines, o.k.? I've heard them all. Why don't you take your film and your tape recorders and your camera, and you can shove them up your publisher's ass. The only time anyone talks to me like that is if they've got something they don't want me writing about. Sorry, but your vulture friends have already picked this carcass clean. Is this my car? Thanks. You were misquoted by the press? Your words were taken out of context on your way to jail? Am i close? I was raped, dragged over the coals, and left for dead by your sleazy paper. Sounds like good reporting, based on what i see. Yeah, well, see this... and report whatever you like. You son of a bitch! You can't do that! That's a press pass! I'll remember this, asshole! Good morning, boys and girls. Good morning, sir. Do we have a progress report, dr. stechman? Stage one is logged. We will know by tomorrow whether the cybernetics are compatible with his particular brain function. Excellent. excellent. Do i hear the word bonus all around looming its ugly head? Ha ha ha! Let me light up what is left of your life, phillip. Does the name jack ring a bell? Jack. As in your brother jack. Well, he's on a holiday, and he's going to pay us a visit. Of course, i have to kill him. Does that bother you? Bother me? No. Perhaps i should have you kill him for me. Would you? I will kill at your command. Excuse me! Are you american? You again! What, are you following me? I couldn't get far enough away from you. I'm on vacation, in case you're lying. I'm not lying! Excuse me! I might wonder why you are so interested in convincing me that you're not up to anything i'd be interested in. Catch-22? How will he play it, she wonders? Like this. good-bye. You're just making me more interested, mystery man. Well, it's too bad. A different situation, a different occupation... i could be interested in you, too. That's not what i meant! Hey! hey! What are you doing? I'm taking this car away. I can't fix it here. I can't take you with me. You're not taking me? Wait! hey! hey! I'm stranded here! Come and join the party, woman. No worries. Stay cool, baby. Excuse me. Can i have a ride to cayes? Can i just hop in the back? Great. Thank you. Let's go, man. Crazy woman. Passport, please. Wait a second. Sarge, check this. This could be our man. Jack ryan? Yeah. What's the purpose of your visit? I'm vacationing. Came to enjoy your lovely country. We have reason to believe you're carrying drugs. I don't think so. You're under arrest. What is this? I'm no dope runner. I was in the d.e.a. call 'em! Stop him! He must not get away! Crazy! He's crazy! Crazy man! Shoot! shoot! Stop him! Radio headquarters! Come now! go! Come on! Into the car! What the hell is going on? Not you! Stop! stop! What... Stop! I knew you were up to something. Shit! Don't stop! Go! go! Will you go? What the hell are you doing here, woman? Stay down! I knew you were up to something! My fucking luck. I had a bad feeling about you! Hold on! we're taking a sharp one! I think i can lose them. Will you hurry up? Got a plan. Quick! get out of here! Hurry! hurry! Are you nuts? How dare you do this to me? What were you doing in my truck with your pants down? Your truck? I didn't know it was your truck, or, believe me, i wouldn't have even gone near it! Who are you? Jack? Fine. Who are you? Kate. You nearly killed me! No, i didn't. They did. But won't it make a nice story, kate? Not if you don't know who you're writing about, jack. Maybe back in miami over a couple pina coladas, but right now, i have to be going. Your stuff. Fine. Will you be all right? I don't know, jack. I'm here on an assignment for voodoo. I haven't even gotten the beginning of a lead for my story. I'm stranded with you, i don't know where. You're probably wanted by interpol or somebody. I'll tell you what, i'll give you a ride into town. Are you going to tell me what's going on? Just get in! I got a bad feeling about this. Welcome, gentlemen, to my humble abode. Thank you, mr. kessel. Good to see you again. This is where the transubstantiation of human into cyborg form takes place, under the capable supervision of dr. stechman here, and, of course, myself. As you can see, no expense has been spared in either research or development on this project. The scientific new wave has finally arrived. Where do you get your financing from? Well, i have certain agricultural and certain pharmaceutical interests that have proved quite lucrative. This way, please, gentlemen. Allow me to present the k-3 prototype cyborg assassin! If you're serious about getting rid of the president of this pathetically provincial backwater of a third-world country, watch this. The car is armor-plated, of course. Now, imagine that the president is inside. Now watch. Mr. kessel, the president never goes anywhere without three or four cars filled with secret agents. They'd annihilate him. I think not. Perhaps you'll allow me to illustrate with a couple of my men. I'd like to use my own for impartiality's sake. Johnson. Johnson. He's a big lad, isn't he? Ha ha ha! My word, a big lad. Johnson... get down there, and do thy best. Quincy... kill him. How much money are we looking at here? $25 million, u.s. that's far too much for our organization. It's far too little for the price of a country. Mr. kessel. I'll let you mull it over. If you'll excuse me. The brother... he got away at the checkpoint. How did he accomplish that? Outsmarted them. He outran them. Got clean away. So he's got all the talents of his older brother, has he? Interesting. Perhaps we should consider converting him as well. We could sell them as a family unit. Properly armed, we could describe them as a nuclear family! What do you think, steve? The problem with you is you have absolutely no vision whatsoever. That's why you work for me and not the other way around, isn't it? We'll have to accept, i'm afraid. Mr. kessel, you've got a deal. Excellent. You won't regret it. Now, how about a nice cup of tea? You see, phillip, this is our bank. White money. Bank. Jack, i hope that's you and not some peeping tom! No. it's just me! Good, because i am starved. You call this dinner? It's not like i could find a pizza hut around here. You always eat a banana like that? You're a liar. You are a drug dealer. This is coke. I told you, that's not coke. That's heroin. You didn't tell me you were carrying it. You didn't ask. Are you a fucking psycho? It's funny you should say that. Funny? Want to tell me something funny about this? Just sit down. Sit down, kate. I tried to tell you before. This is the only link i have to what my brother was doing down here. He sent it to me as evidence. I thought i might need it, o.k.? All right. I'm starting to believe you. Good. Only a d.e.a. agent could smuggle heroin out of the country. Smuggling it out is easy. Getting it in, that's where you get tripped up. You're too much. You're pretty bad yourself, pretty bad with a banana. So i guess i should expect more surprises? Well, surprises make for a good story, don't they? You're saying i can print this? No. i'm saying that it's a good story. Let's just see how it ends, o.k.? O.k. You should go to your room. I don't want to give away the ending too soon. O.k. Good night. Good night. Hope you didn't, use all the cold water. Looks like a one-horse town to me. The horse just died. Boy! I'll get us a couple rooms. One room under one name... Mr. and mrs. downing. The police are looking for a single man, not a married couple. What's that, journalist school? I'll go see what i can weasel out of the local constable, o.k.? Hey, be careful, o.k.? Why? you're not. Sure, i am. It just doesn't look that way. Well, we've got people living here who still believe in voodoo. They say it's powerful medicine to eat the flesh of a dead enemy. I think it's a lot of horse droppings, but i've got nine corpses in the morgue with their faces missing... Ripped out, clean as a whistle. Don't know where they came from. I must ask myself, "is it voodoo, or is it just simple murder?" if you figure it out, let me know. Have you heard the name phillip ryan? Perhaps. Why do you ask? He's a friend. Sent me a post card. Can't find him anywhere. Well, maybe he left... suddenly. Are you thinking i should do the same? I have no particular thought on that subject... yet. Good day. Hi. room for two, please. Two singles or a double? Double. Hey, do you know where i might cop some white? White what? You know... h, dragon, smack... Whatever they call it down here. Heroin. There ain't heroin on the island. You know, that's what people keep telling me, but i heard different. You know, i think i also heard different. Where? Maybe at the club behind the hotel... A place called the jive joint. But with that kind of cash, i might give you some advice. You're too pale to hang around that place too long. Thanks. i'll keep that in mind. You got a first name, mr. downing? Jack. Watch your ass, jack. This ain't cleveland, man yeah, i noticed the lake was missing. Mr. kessel? Speaking. The american is here. Well done, lad. Well done. Our guest has arrived. Um! You have disgusting habits, you know? Give me a beer. Mind if i join you? Yeah. sit down. You know that black aces wild, no draw. Come. Money on the table. I'm looking for an american guy. His name is phillip ryan. Maybe he came through here. Looks something like me. Couple of weeks ago, there was an american in town. Maybe it was the same man, maybe not. Two pair. Ace high. Sorry to ruin a good hand, but mr. kessel wants to meet you. He's got something you're interested in. Seeing how i don't know anybody by that name, i can't see how i'd be interested. If mr. kessel wants to talk with you, you should listen. I'd rather play cards with you guys. You're probably a better class of people. Why don't you guys chill out? Go grab a beer. Pull up a chair and lose some money. O.k. sure. O.k. we'll go see mr. kessel. A fight! Kick him again! Try me, you motherfucker! What will you do with that knife? I'm only going to ask you this once. What's kessel have i'll be interested in? I don't know! Is it my brother? Don't say i didn't warn you. Man, that hurts, doesn't it? You sure you don't know anything? You tell this guy kessel i'll visit him when i'm ready for it, not when he's ready for it. You get my drift? He one good white boy fighter. Man, you ought to get that fixed. You can get a ticket. How'd it go at the police station? Jack, there are nine bodies in the morgue with their faces missing. The police don't know who they are. Did you see them? No. How many men were in phillip's team? It depends on the mission. Even if we do get into the morgue, we're not going to be able to identify him. Phillip's got a scar... on his neck, right here... from a gunshot wound. You love your brother a lot, enough to risk coming here. I like that about you. It just goes with the job. I guess. I... i'd almost forgotten... but you're pretty tough yourself, you know it? Sometimes too tough. It goes with my job, too, you know? I'm sorry about whatever one of our reporters did to you. It wasn't your problem to begin with, kate. No. But it would be my pleasure to finish it. Whatever it was, it's in the past. You and i are here in the present together, and i've got a feeling that things are going to get much worse before they get better. I get that feeling a lot. So... maybe we should do something about it. Yeah, maybe we should. Idiot! I want this brother before he does any more damage! O.k. And fire this moron! You're fired. I just had that wall painted! Ha ha! I'm sorry, boss. Give him the voodoo face treatment and dump him outside the shantytown. Ooh, i could smack you sometimes. Ha ha! Hey, don't you know how to be knocking? What do you want in this place this time of night, anyway? We understand there are nine bodies here. We'd like to look at them. First, go to the police station and get a clearance certificate. Is that what it looks like? That's exactly what him look like? Don't i know you from someplace? I got a brother looks kind of like me. It's jim morrison is your brother, man. That's who you look like. No. him dead. Speaking of the dead... this way. Them all dead from voodoo shit, man. You believe in that stuff? Yeah. don't be fuckin' with voodoo. Well, look if you like, although i can't see why you'd want to. Them still in there right now. Give me my money. Here you are. Get back. Talk to him. Hey, man, can we go now? I don't mind waiting out in front, but... get down! You guys o.k.? What was that all about, man? Get her out of here. What, are you blind? It's a fully automatic lamamite-5 with a 50-round clip. Hold it right there, pal. Am i happy to see you. There's a couple... Shit. Kate! I'll give you something for that headache later. Who's the guy in the car? I must be dead, man. Who is he? Only mr. kessel hit like that. Kessel? What's he do? Where's he live? Kessel mayor. Live in big house. Show me. We don't trust nobody who brings a zombie into the morgue to fight with late at night. Look, you want zombie? This will turn you into a zombie! Now, let's go! Police! Drop your weapon! The good guys. Drop it! Now spread 'em! Look, you got some weird stuff going on in this town. Come on. Mr. ryan! You're in trouble. You're under arrest. Arrest? what for? Illegal entry, resisting arrest, possession of an unlicensed firearm, disturbing the peace, car theft. Have i forgotten anything? Mr. ryan. You are in big trouble. It's terrible! The main application computer's completely destroyed, along with the motoric interface. Well, that's impossible. He's indestructible. If the circuit is shorted with an electrical charge, the software is erased. That is his achilles heel. The man who destroyed him found it. How long to repair him? The reprogram would take at least three days, and damage to the hardware... Three weeks. The buyers come for him tomorrow. Have them wait. They've got a date set for an assassination! Besides, we have potential buyers anxiously awaiting the outcome. We could lose millions of dollars! Use the cop instead. Forget it. We need two days to eradicate his emotional memory. Then he needs physical tests before we install the fight program. He's a cop! He already knows how to fight! Steven, i like it! Do it. Accelerate the program. We tried it on chimps, and we destroyed them all! He's not a chimp! He's a man! Or he was! Look, we have no alternative. Do it. we have to take the risk. Hogan's in the control room. And the girl? Locked in the house. Keep her there. She's our insurance policy, just in case something goes wrong. Here. This is yours. I want him. Without that evidence, he's got nothing on you. I told you to bring him to me. Look, mr. kessel, the last thing you want is fbi agents looking for missing americans. You don't need that attention. Don't push me, hogan. I'll take care of him. I give you my word. So i'll finally meet this kessel clown? Your return ticket to denver. You connect out of miami. Compliments of kessel? Hardly. That fellow you wasted with the metal head and exotic manicure... It must have cost him 10 million. I'd say he wants you more than deported. So this was your idea? Serve and protect any way i can. Never serve me. Shut up! What about the girl? I'll do what i can. And my brother? I'm from a big family, so i understand, but you've got to turn your back on this blood relative. There will be more blood shed... yours. It would be yours if i wasn't cuffed. I saved your life! He's a drug-dealing, murdering, who-knows-what, and you're letting him run this town? Without him, there'd be no town. There'd be no jobs. Wouldn't even be a school. You're a disgrace to the uniform. You're a leech. You're no better than he is. Worse, because you should be and know it. What's that? Put that down! Pull over. What the hell? Pull over! Pull over. Give me the keys. Hey, captain. Shut up! You're late. You're lucky i came at all. On payday? A lot of money for a career cop. Don't fuck with me, kessel. Did you get rid of ryan? You shouldn't have sent him here. He came on his own. You shouldn't have made his brother a fuckin' brain-dead robot. He's not dead, you brainless, syphilitic idiot! He is life perfected! I have perfected the art of life itself! You've perfected the art of bullshit, kessel. You need an attitude check... and i need my money. I trust that, um... when the presidency is within your control, we'll continue to have a normal, healthy business relationship. In what way? Well, to be concise, i want no interference in my business affairs. What do we get in exchange? Access to my latest technology. O.k. Very wise decision. We'd like our merchandise now. Of course. and you'll be delighted to know, you're getting a more advanced model. Shut the case! That case is armed with high explosives. It will only open to arthur's handprint. Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen. The phase-iii cyborg is superior in every way to the model that i demonstrated. We'll be the judge of that. You know something, big captain hogan? Maybe this white boy is right, man. The people of this town doing nothing about mr. kessel and his killing. Before kessel came, we was all poor, sure, but everyone, including yourself, was proud to be from jacmael cayes! But now... ha! So what are you saying? I'm saying maybe we should be doing some standing up behind the white boy. The demonstration, please! Dr. stechman. One moment. Before his metamorphosis into the cyborg form, this was a highly trained member of the drug enforcement agency. In fact, he was one of captain callan's number-one undercover cops. Am i right, captain callan? Yep. he was. And in a way you were responsible for his death, weren't you? What are you getting at? What i'm getting at, captain callan, is that... wouldn't it be ironic if he, in his turn... ha ha ha! Were to be responsible for your death? Yeah. Very ironic. I've had about all the egomaniacal bullshit of yours i can take. I got a plane to catch. Now, where is my money? What is this? Just a demonstration. Bear with me. Captain callan, why don't you shake hands with your former top cop and late best friend? He's a perfect employee. He only does what he's told to do, when he's told to do it. He's got no brain. What do you expect? I expect you to behave like him, even with your minuscule brain! Now, phillip... shake captain callan's hand. Phillip, crush captain callan's hand. You see, it isn't a question of megalomania. It's a question of science. Science is cybernetics, and i am its prophet! And with all due modesty, my dear captain callan, i may say that i am the greatest scientist on earth! O.k., you've made your point. No, i haven't quite finished making my point yet. Phillip... kill him. No, phil... don't do it for this bastard. I was your best... There you are, gentlemen. You see? He works just perfectly. Isn't he beautiful? Now, how about a nice cup of tea? What was that? - No need to be alarmed, gentlemen. It's just my men engaged in a training exercise. I'll quiet them down. Stay here a moment. Come on! Where is the water? Put out the fire! What's that? Over here! Hurry! Get the girl. Yes, sir. get the case. Pain's pretty intense? Show me where the girl is or feel no pain at all. Let's go! let's go! Get moving! Wait! wait! Wait for us! Everyone, out of that helicopter now! You've cost me a great deal of money. Now, put that gun down, or i'll blow her head off. Put it down! Well, you must be kessel. Very perceptive of you. It's sad that i have to kill you. I wanted to make you a member of my little family. Speaking of family... Excuse my manners, or the lack of them. You haven't met your new, improved brother yet, have you? Phillip! Phillip... phillip, it's me... jack. What have you done to him? The same thing that i'm going to do to your blond friend. But first, a real family reunion. Phillip! Kill your brother. Brother? You see? he doesn't even recognize you. Jack, don't let him touch you! Don't stand there, phillip. Let's take this dickhead out. Phillip, i command you. Kill your brother. Come on, phil. It's me. Come on. remember. The psycho crew, for taking out the bad guys. Remember... the psycho crew! Psycho crew. We're family. You're the responsible one. You... phillip! Quincy! Kill the brother! Way to go, phil! Back in action. Phillip! Get out of here. Phillip. Jack... take care frankie. Good-bye... brother. - You'll be all right. Phillip! Shit! Let her go. Over my dead body. Shit! watch out! For a great mind, you sure are a big sucker. Kill the brother. Kill the brother. You two all right? Yeah. Glad you decided to be a real cop. But don't push your luck. You've broken about a hundred laws. About a hundred less than usual. Well, we're about even. Kill brother. You want me? Come on! Some story? Captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc. Captions copyright 1993 nu world services ltd.
