[electricity crackling] [boy] You are never more alive than when you’re a teenager. [electricity zapping] Your brain is flush with chemicals that can turn your life into a story of epic proportions. An A-minus feels like the Pulitzer, a lonely Saturday night is an eternity of solitude, and your lab partner becomes the great love of your life. And yet, by the start of my senior year, nothing interesting or remarkable had ever happened to me. -I was grateful for my life. -[laughs] I had my best friends-- all two of them... Relax. You got this. ...parents who met and fell in love when they were my age, and my writing. [reading] But a platform was pointless unless I actually had something to say. And I didn’t, because nothing worth writing about had ever happened to me. [closes laptop] Then, on the day I found out about the job, something finally happened. [chattering] [sighs] [man] Hi, guys. Thanks for swinging by. Come on in. You want us both? Yes, both of you would be great. Come on. [man] Grace just transferred here from East River, where she spent two years writing for the Gazette. You both possess remarkable depth for writers your age. Which is why I think that you two will make a truly dynamic editor-in-chief duo. No. What? Uh, one more time? I don’t want to be an editor. But thank you. Um... Hey. -Why’d you say no? -What? Why’d you say no? Why do you care? What? Why do you care? Uh... I don’t. It’s just a good opportunity for a writer, I guess. I just don’t get why you would say no. All right, well, don’t let it keep you up at night. [sighs] Oh, shit. What? I just missed my bus. Can’t walk? Um... no, I mean, I can. It’s just far. Uh, that’s why I take the bus. My house is up there. I have a car. I can give you a ride if you want. Yeah? Thanks. Hey, so you like "Nehradah"? Neruda. Oh. [laughs] Oh. Um... Yeah, well, I only read a stanza, but I thought it was really beautiful. You think so? Yeah. Do you not? No, I just think that’s what people say when they read a poem that they don’t understand. Hmm. [sniffs] [Grace] Finish it. And let me know if you still feel the same way. [bicycle bell dings] [train horn blowing in distance] Huh. It’s a cool place. How come you walk to school if you have a car? I don’t like driving. -Do you have a license? -Yeah.

We will have four issues-- the first in November, the last in June. The first three are garden-variety periodicals: hard-hitting news, sports, features, the like. But the last one, that’s where we get creative. With the help of the group, Henry will choose a theme, and you will have carte blanche to explore that theme as you see fit. That last issue will be this team’s legacy, an opportunity to share your accrued wisdom with the students behind you. I’m not just talking about the four years that you’ve spent within the walls of this building. I am talking bigger than that. I am talking about the totality of your 17 years on this planet. Last but not least, Grace here joins us from our neighboring school, East River Preparatory, and will lend Henry a helping hand with all things editorial. Now, here’s what Kyle and his team did for last year’s final issue. Um, I’m sorry. Uh, Kyle sucks. [laughter] [teacher] Very constructive, La. Well, okay, um... the final issue last year did kind of suck. [quiet laughter] [sighs] All right. [students chattering quietly] Um, hey, so I don’t know what your thoughts... So, I’m not writing. If you have something to say, you can just say it yourself, and I’ll help with, like, editing and design and... I handle design. Well, everything other than design then. But just not... just not writing. And I’m assistant editor, because apparently you worked very hard for this, so it should be all yours. [Henry] Looks like Cora’s into you again. Yo, what is the deal with her? She’s making eyes at me, laughing at all my jokes, and it’s like this air pocket that’s, like, connecting us, and it’s just filled with, like, marshmallows, gummy bears, and freakin’ bubble gum and sparklies, and it’s just like, if I eat it, I’m gonna get another cavity like last year, and I can’t. Hmm, good metaphor. Thank you. I appreciate it. Hey, Grace. Hankard. I, um... This is our bus! ...actually didn’t get a chance to tell you, I finished that poem. And, um... yeah. I still think it’s beautiful, but not in the, uh, normal kind of bullshit way. Um, which, uh, which I think is also kind of what the poem’s about, ’cause, you know, Neruda’s love for her doesn’t come from, like, uh... [sighs] sunshine and roses and cliché stuff. You know, it comes from, um, her... flaws and her imperfections, like, darker places. [La] Hankard! Uh, comes from...

Well, I thought you were a writer. Uh... yeah, I mean, exactly. I could probably go home right now and write you something about why I’ve never had a girlfriend, like an essay or whatever. Oh, so you just have to edit everything. No, it’s not editing. It’s just, writing, I think, sometimes helps me... understand myself, I guess, ’cause... a lot of times, I don’t really know how I feel about something until I really sit down and think about it.

When all of this is over, and we’re dispersed back into nothingness... we have a clean slate. It’s like having all of your sins wiped away. Sure you don’t want to write for the paper?

So, I couldn’t sleep last night, so I was searching through Mrs. Klein’s syllabus, and I noticed a very interesting trend. Uh... Look at them. Okay. [Henry] Um, yeah. They’re, um, all about young people? [Grace] And they all involve suicide. Romeo and Juliet off themselves. Werther shoots himself. Holden contemplates suicide. Conrad tries to kill himself by slashing his wrists. This is what you were up thinking about last night? Yeah. Is that normal? Oh, Jesus. What? Well, I... [sighs] You... You, uh, like, seemed down this week, so that’s a little scary, I guess. Okay. How do I explain this? Um... okay. Think about what it means to be a teenager. Okay? Your parents pressure you to succeed. Your friends pressure you to do shit you don’t want to do. Social media pressures you to hate your body. It’s hard, even if you’re a well-adjusted kid from a good family. Okay. So, now imagine you can’t be with the person that you love, like Romeo and Juliet or Werther, or you lose the person that you love, like Holden or Conrad. There’s a reason why, when every author, from Shakespeare to Salinger, writes about young people, they can’t avoid the truth, that... being young is so painful, it’s almost, like, too much to feel. Yeah, are you, like... suicidal or... No. God. I mean... Look, I’m not gonna kill myself. But have I thought about what it would be like to just not be here anymore? Yeah. And I don’t say that casually, but I do say it because hiding that shit and not saying it makes it worse. It should be talked about. All of our shit should be talked about. Mmm. The teenage years are... limbo. You’re somewhere between being a kid and an adult, and the world, uh, tells you to be mature and express yourself, but the minute that you do, it tells you to shut up. The thing is, adults are just scarred kids who were lucky enough to make it out of limbo alive. Which is why... the theme of our last issue should be "Teenage Limbo." [quietly] Yeah. -[mouse clicking] -[La] Henry’s sister is studying to become a neurosurgeon, and she explained that the teenage brain goes through an upgrade before it matures to an adult brain. So, the upgrade is like an explosion of connections and synapses as we figure out what’s right. [gasps] Or wrong. [sighs] What we like, what we don’t like. You know, who we want to be. -[mouse clicking] -Each page of the issue is the brain refining itself, figuring itself out, until eventually it’s out of limbo. So dope. [quietly] Yeah. Dope. [claps] All right. Sweet. Um... so I think we could kind of just start a-- kind of a discussion, like what are we confused about, what, uh, maybe scares us. Um, like, are there things maybe you keep inside that you’re afraid to... Um... Do you have something? Um... Well, yeah, I mean, I do, but I was gonna... I think I was gonna write it, uh, which... Hmm. [Henry smacks lips] Um... [chuckles] Uh, when Mike Johnson killed himself a couple years ago, um... I realized that I still had, um, this... Hustler magazine that he gave me when we were, like, 13 that, uh, he stole from his dad’s collection. And, um... [laughs] I don’t know. I feel really stupid admitting this, but, um, kind of freaked me out. Like, I couldn’t really sleep at night with this magazine in my drawer. Um, like it was just kind of... like, haunted or something. Um... And basically, it just was kind of too important to throw away, but it was also too weird to keep, so I went to the tree by the art park, one where he, uh, hung himself, and I, um, just buried it there. And, um... Yeah. Um... I don’t know. It was weird, ’cause for the first time, I was old enough to understand the gravity of death, but I was also, um, you know, young enough that it all came down to just a stupid, like, porn magazine. [sighs] [Grace] I’m proud of you for sharing that. It must have been hard for you. Thanks. Hey, why’d you give up writing? You’ve obviously got a lot of ideas. Somebody really important to me... died. And, um... and I was asked to write something, to say something, like a eulogy, because everyone knew that I was the writer, and, you know, told me how beautiful my words were, but... Nothing came. I just couldn’t find the words. [chuckles] What? Uh, oh, no, it’s just funny. Um, ’cause, you know, I can’t find the words when I talk, and you can’t find the words when you write. That just made me laugh. [laughs] You know what I mean? ["Where’s My Love" by SYML playing] ♪ Cold bones ♪ ♪ Yeah, that’s my love... ♪ [laughs] Thank you, anyways. Yeah, yeah. I feel like it’s...

That your mom? No. Yeah. It doesn’t... matter. You all right? I’m fine. Can we go? [brakes squeak] [both sigh] So do you live with your dad? [sighs] [chuckles] I mean, I just feel like I don’t know anything about your family. Well, yeah. Well, okay, you know enough. Something obviously just happened, so I don’t know how I’m supposed to help you-- You don’t. You don’t help me. I didn’t ask for your help, so stop trying to help me. Stop trying to fix me, all right? [Sharma] Oh, look at this. It’s a lollygagging convention in here. Let’s go, people. We have three more issues to plan. I’d love to see a little focus, please. Henry, where’s your partner in crime? I don’t know. She sick? I don’t know. Today’s the anniversary of her accident. Oh, dear. I, um... I didn’t know that. Yeah. East River had a candlelight vigil for her boyfriend. [line ringing] -[chattering] -[line continues ringing] Does she drive? Does she have her license? Should we be... [continues indistinctly] You’re probably right about that. -[Grace] Leave your message. -[beep] I would think so. Would you? Yeah. [sighs] I don’t know. Muck around. Muck around a little more. Muck. What? Stop it. No. Ow. Stop. Muck around. Hankard. Hankard. Yo, where you going? [panting] [thunder rumbling] [door opens] Henry? That you? Yeah. Come on in. [thunder rumbling] I must have fallen asleep in front of the tube. I’m Martin, by the way. [sportscast playing on TV] Oh. This is my wife Sarah. Hi. [Henry] Hello. [groans, coughs] Grace has talked a lot about you. Says you’ve been a good friend. Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that she was okay, ’cause I didn’t talk to her today. Um, and, you know, given what day it is, I... I, uh... Well, she should be home pretty soon. You can wait upstairs if you want. Um, well, thank you. It was good meeting you guys. [Martin] Yeah. Nice meeting you, Henry. Yeah. [Grace] So now you know. Do you live here? [sniffles] Yeah. I moved in a month before the accident to get away from my mom. She was drinking a lot, and she was in really bad shape. But you’re still here. Where else was I supposed to go, my mom’s boyfriend’s couch? [sniffles] [sighs] You went back for that? [sniffles] [panting] Do you even wash his clothes? ’Cause you wear his clothes, right? I’m doing the best that I can. You’re doing the best you can, but you’re living in his fucking room? We grew up together. He was... he was my family. [stammers] I’m not asking you to let him go. I’m giving you all that I can. And this... confusion and this craziness is what that looks like. And you can’t handle it, but I never expected you to. What else could I possibly give you? What else can you give me? Are you fucking... Oh, this is crazy. This is crazy. Just stop. No, you stop! Stop leading me on! I just-- I didn’t start dating you out of nowhere or something. I told you to leave me alone. Yeah, but then you told me not to. Well, because I don’t know. Because I don’t know. I know. I don’t know. I’m confused, Henry. I don’t know. I know! I’ve known since, like, the very beginning that I love you. I can’t pretend to be better because that’s what you want. You said you wanted to get better. I do. I’m not ready yet. I’m not-- I do, but I’m not ready yet. Well, I... I don’t care. All right? Yes, you do. I... No, I don’t. I don’t care. Seriously, I want you exactly the way you are. But you just got to let me in and talk to me. I love you. -[thunder rumbling] -[rain continues] Why do you kiss me like that? Like what? Like you’re in love with me. It’s the only way I know how. [crickets chirping] -[door opens, slams] -[TV playing quietly] [mother] Plate’s for you in the oven, toots. -[father] Henry? -What? What’s wrong? [sighs] Nothing. What’s wrong? Nothing. Come here. Come on. We just want to know what’s going on. Is it Grace? It’s just regular shit that regular people go through that you are not gonna understand. Oh, come on. We’re not regular people? No. No. Are you fucking kidding me? Your relationship’s been perfect since you were my age. I got this. No, no, no, no, no. We should go. Mom. He’s right. You don’t understand. I got it. Did you guys break up? Yeah. I mean, I don’t even know if we were actually together. Maybe it’s just a bump in the road. No, she doesn’t want me. What happened? [sniffles] She’s in love with someone else. Oh, shit. [quietly] Okay. [sighs] You want the good news or the bad news? Neither. Well, the bad news is it’s gonna hurt. Your brain has gotten used to a steady stream of dopamine and oxytocin. Here we go again. Yeah, I know. I’m sorry, but that’s what causes all those blissed-out feelings of love. And now it’s replaced with stress hormones. They’re gonna make you feel like garbage. Headaches, tight muscles, tight chest. Your body’s craving those feel-good chemicals. It’s basically withdrawal. Oh, awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Yesterday was the first day I didn’t think about him. And tomorrow I’m going on my first date. Henry. Hmm? Love-- it’s a chemical reaction that comes and goes. Here’s the good news: so is heartbreak. Your brain adjusts. Your body chemistry changes back to normal. It’s all a waste of time. [quietly] Oh, no. Hey. Would you take it all back if you could? You can’t. She’s a part of you now. [crickets chirping] [lighter clicks] [night birds chirping] [both] Are you trying to... Are you gonna copy me this whole time? Okay. [Cora] No, but I actually have a real question. Wait. You can’t do that. What’s over there? [chuckles] I did it. [laughs] I did it. [La] Where you going? Um... I don’t know. Just don’t want to watch this. Wow. You just can’t be happy for anybody else. Boo. Don’t even-- don’t do that. [laughs] Don’t do that. [phone chimes] [phone clicks] Whoa. -[man] Watch it! -[horn honks] Oh! [girl] Whoa, did you see that? [water dripping] [Grace sobbing] Grace? [panting] Are you okay? I need to-- -I need to tell you. -What? What do you need? I need to tell you. -What? -I need to say it, Dom. I need to say it, Dom. [sobbing] Okay, say it. It should have been me. It should have been me. [sobbing] It should have been me. No. No. It should have been me. Yes, you fucking asshole! It was my fault! No, it wasn’t, Grace. Yes, it was. -No, it wasn’t. -You told me to stop teasing you. You told me. [sobbing] You told me, and I didn’t listen. I didn’t listen. It’s okay. I just wanted to make you laugh. -It’s okay. It’s okay. -But you told me to stop. Oh, I’m sorry. It’s all right. I’m sorry. I’m sorry! It’s okay. It’s okay. [sobbing] It’s okay. [sobbing continues] [panting] [sobs] [sniffles] I felt him swerve. And I knew, in that fraction of a second, that we were gonna crash. And my last thought before it happened was, "Shit." The last thought I was about to have in my entire life was, "Shit." I didn’t think about Dom. I didn’t even think about him. [sobs] Does that make me a bad person, Henry? No. [sobs] Makes you a person. I wonder what he was thinking about. I wonder what his last thought was. He was thinking about you, Grace. Guarantee it. [sniffles] [water continues dripping] [cane thumping] [sniffles] [sniffles] I was gonna marry him in that dress. [electricity crackling, whooshing] [gearshift clicks] [engine idling] No, you keep it. It’s cold out. [students chattering] [Sharma] Quick announcement, everyone. If I might have everyone’s attention for a moment, please. -[chattering stops] -Thank you. So, I wanted to let you know that Grace Town has decided to take some time off from school to deal with some personal issues. And, um, when she returns, she’d prefer to focus on her studies rather than the newspaper. I’m sure we’ll all miss her very much, but, uh, it does sound like this is the best decision for her at this time. I know this news might come as a disappointment, but I want you to know that I have the utmost faith in this group of people [echoing, fading] to produce three stellar issues. [birds chirping] -[electricity crackling] -[Henry] When you’re a teenager, the chemicals in your brain drive you to make decisions that rip you away from the safety of your childhood and drag you into the wilderness of adulthood. A friend once told me that adults are just scarred kids who were lucky enough to make it out of teenage limbo alive. I urge you to go outside and look at the world through that prism. Look at your parents, your older siblings. Look at strangers you pass on the street. Look at them and imagine that, at one point in their lives, they too walked these halls. They too felt the unbearable loneliness, the absolute unbearable powerlessness and darkness of being young. Number two! [students cheering] This is three. [students cheering] [Henry] We tend to think of scars as ugly or imperfect... as things we want to hide or forget. But they never go away. -[typing] -As I write this, my last editorial... [reading] I finally understand that scars are not reminders of what’s been broken, but rather of what’s been created. [school bell ringing] [chattering] Hey. Hey. [quietly] Let’s... Congratulations. Yeah, you too. Thank you. Yeah. Where are you off to next year? I’m gonna go to Bennington. It’s a school in Vermont. It’s good for writing. Nice. What are you doing? Uh, I’m taking a year off. Just continuing therapy. Oh. Yeah, I was never gonna be ready until I was... ready, you know? Of course you know. Yeah. I have to go find my words again. Yeah. You will. I just want to say... you are an extraordinary collection of atoms, Henry Page. [breathes deeply] [sighs] ["Take Care" by Beach House playing] [laughter] Hey, is that Hankard? Hankard! Hankard!
