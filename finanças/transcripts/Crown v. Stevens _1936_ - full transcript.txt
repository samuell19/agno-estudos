Just the usual business books, those files and some letters I'm afraid they are not going to be much use to us,Sir Why not? Just come over here a minute,Sir A grate full of burnt papers Probably just the one that would tell us who did it Torn out of this book here It's like an account book of some sort It's part of a cash ruling Well,it's not any doubt this job was done by one of his clients,Sir Someone he's been putting his screws on a bit What the Superintendent will call a nice and easy case,eh? You'd better go back to the station and get hold of the firearms register We got to check very carefully of everybody in this district with an automatic Blimey 5 past 9 And now the(?) I can't get on with the job because there's nobody here to give me any time sheets They don't mean nothing in your life at all, do it? No Well,isn't it My Lord,Duke I've heard that you were up in Scotland salmon(?) shooting Fancy you bothering to turn up to work at this time of the day Is these that you want? Oh,thank you,My Lord And now I'll go on with the work and try to get enough money to keep the idler sitting comfortable hanging around in this office What's the matter,son? Nothing I'm all right You look a bit pale around the gills Cheer up you'll be a long time dead You finished with this? Yes,you can have it Thanks,I'll tell you -Good morning,Alf -Good morning,governor We ought to be able to finish the roof of 58 today Time's running on on that job Any news on the Barton Crescent? I'll work out the quantities of that this morning,Alf Hey,stop spotting winners and get on with the job Well,what are you doing,Jensen? Checking these invoices,Sir Oh,they can wait,I left my book of quantities at home,I want you to get it Yes,Sir Take a bus and be as quick as you can I'll give you a note to Mrs Stevens It's somewhere in the sitting room, you know the book I mean Yes,Sir,the little one with a leather binding That's right -Get back with it as soon as you can -Yes,Sir A note Madame It'll be on the shelf Thank you,good morning,Madame Good morning Here it is Well? I didn't expect to find you here Drop that Why do you follow me? I didn't It's true I come from the office What's your name? Jensen And you didn't know I was here? No Ten million people in London and it had to be you So you didn't go to the police? No You would be afraid they'll get you It wasn't that I couldn't get mixed up in it It's my job If Mr Stevens knew he'd sack me and I might not get another I understand Smoke? Now you know,are you going to the police? I don't know Before I didn't know who you were but now There's nothing else I can do,is there? Yes,there is,look here You and I are both in the same boat I didn't murder Bayleck any more than you did You had the gun in your hand I know but it wasn't murder I took it to frighten him Oh,Mr Jensen you must believe me That man was going to ruin my life He was going to ruin mine too Did you owe him money too? Yes Then you do know Mr Jensen these things are much worse for women I took the revolver to protect myself against Bayleck I couldn't pay him the money that I owed him and he'd been.. Well you can guess You mean he attacked you? Of course That's how the gun went off You didn't think I'd shoot him,did you? The papers say the police is sure it's murder Now I've proved that it wasn't If you go to them now I haven't got a chance And I'm innocent as you are Surely if you went to them and explained everything they'll understand They might How long have you worked for Mr Stevens? Just over a year Then you know what would happen,he'll turn me into the streets I know exactly me if I were mixed up in this but you,you're his wife? You know how Mr Stevens feels about money He never gives me enough for myself But if he knew I borrowed from Bayleck he wouldn't need a thing like this to make it turn me out He's pretty hard about the office too He's worse at home Mr Jensen,I'm in your hands There's no other evidence against me If you feel you must go to the police I can't stop you But now you've heard my story You must believe it I can understand about Bayleck You don't know what I went through But if you feel my life and probably your own should be ruined because of a man like that I don't know I'll have to think it over Of course I'm sorry I kept you so long I'll just wait here You see I'm trusting myself to you An even if you decide against me I understand Old Service Webley 17943 Did you know Bayleck? I don't do business with moneylenders Possibly lots of people in this district do Lots of them have firearms certificates too That gun hasn't been fired since the war It's obvious it's the wrong calibre You can cross Mr Stevens name off the list,Wells Thank you,Mr Stevens Sorry to trouble you Quite all right,Inspector,good day Thank you Jensen -Yes,Sir -What's the matter with you?

The young fool dropped my quantities book while they were in there -Is that all? -Of course,what else could there be They won't suspecting me Just wanted a look at my revolver What made Jensen drop the book? How do I know? He didn't say anything BTW I haven't seen that little revolver of yours lately Revolver?

Because I want to take him away for a little holiday That is if you can take care of things I suppose I could I know you could I've got him half this way to go on a little cruise There is just one point I suppose this is one of those things men worry about He says the business is going so badly he can't afford to go away Of course I know I shouldn't ask you Well,I don't know much about that but As for running the business,Alf and I, Alf's the foreman,we could manage And the business isn't doing badly,is it,Mr Jensen? No,we are very busy I knew it,you see Mr Stevens has been a little delirious lately He keeps saying that he'll sell out for a thousand pounds For a thousand? It's so silly isn't it? Yes,I should say five or six As much as that? I don't know I should think so It really doesn't matter And I'm sorry for what I said to you the other day It's true Mr Stevens has been very careful with me about money Of course I know it's for my own good But I was terribly excited the other day when I said all that Of course And you've been so understanding Please,you won't let Mr Stevens know what I told you about his health? He's so very sensitive You won't,will you? Very well,I won't Thank you again,Mr Jensen,good bye Good bye I want to see Mr Stevens I don't know about that, he's not seen no one He's got the flu Yes,I've been vaccinated I've had my tonsils out a little thing like flu ain't going to worry me,handsome I'm his foreman and I must see him Oh,are you his foreman You tell him Alf see a bright ?,he'll see me -Who is it? -It's the foreman to see you Send him up What did I tell you,handsome? This is the strongest we are allowed to sell without a prescription Really? I'm frightened of sleeping draught,it's awful to stay awake all night,isn't it? Well,of course it is,but I wouldn't make a habit of relying on medicines,Madame Of course not, that's what I'm afraid of Are they very nasty?

Look at this It's your gun It's your gun that killed that moneylender How did that get out of the house? How should I know? Don't you see what it means? There's no doubt that it was your gun How can you be so sure? The police have often made mistakes before Where is it? Probably in the drawer where it always has been Which one? The second long drawer It's not here What can we do about it? We must find out how it got out of this house -Maggie -Yes,Sir? Do you know what's become of Mrs Stevens revolver? Mrs Stevens's revolver? I don't know nothing about that revolver Why do you lie? You've seen it in the drawer Yes,Mam,I did it once Did you take it,Maggie? Oh no Sir,I swear I never,I was that nervous so I shook when I've seen it Are you sure you didn't take it? Out your little liar,and it's not the first thing I missed out of this house Now Mrs Stevens I wont take that from no one I've never know I had in my life, I've nothing No real lady would treat me the way you've done But you can't take away my good character I didn't take your gun I've never stole nothing You can take my notice Yes and now She didn't take it She's such a little liar, she must have taken it I heard that,I heard that,keeping on at me We must go to the police and tell them at once that the gun has been stolen -The police? -What else is there to do? Why must we be mixed up in a nasty miserable murder? We must go What if they traced the gun to you and found that you'd said nothing? Don't you see? It would look if you killed the man Won't it wait until tomorrow? You're too ill to go out tonight,Arthur No,I'm all right It will only take a minute Very well,if you say so But you'll have your milk and soup first,won't you? Very well When did you last see it? They are sure to ask you that I've never take very much attention to it Drink that while it's hot -Peculiar taste? -Did you drink it all? Yes Than it can't have been too bad Rather musty Doris,I can't help feeling that gun For heaven's sake shut up It's bad enough to be mixed up in a mess like this Rather ever talking about it? You go and tell the police it was my gun And it's their worry how it got out Not my business Take my character away That what's they are trying to do I've never touched the old gun What was that? I suppose that wretched girl has gone Maybe we should have prevented her Why? The police would want her I suppose They can find her Don't be so long at that,Doris I can't find my I feel so It's very peculiar -Ill? -No,weak So sleepy Well,if we are going to do this You can't sleep now No I'll be all right You go along downstairs I'm coming Doris Arthur -Yeah -You can't sleep here No,of course not The air would do you good You do feel better now? I think so You rest there,Arthur,I'll open the door All right I'll just warm up the engine It's all right,Arthur All right -Go on,Sir -Thank you I think you should have gone directly to the police If she shot him in self defence,she'll get off Suppose if she didn't? How would you feel if you were in my place and she were convicted? Or even hanged? I'll always feel maybe there was a mistake and I killed her Yes And now I'm going to do something I'm going to see Mr Stevens myself I hoped you'd say that I sort of prepared an excuse for going up What's that? Blank cheque for the payroll Gosh, I feel better when I know more about this I'll run up and get him to sign this -We'll run up -No There's no sense in you going to be mixed up in this Oh,go and sit and ? or something -Molly ,please -We can use my car -Well -I was just thinking -What about? -Mamie Oh,how very nice,I am pleased You ought to be If I had her here I'll wring her neck Let's go -I won't be a minute -OK,I'll wait Good evening,Mrs Stevens Oh,it's you Mr Jensen I've just run up to get Mr Stevens to sign the cheque for the payroll I'm afraid that's absolutely impossible He's fast asleep I do hope the doorbell didn't awaken him I'm sorry perhaps I could call back Well,I don't think that would be any good Give me the cheque and I'll see he gets it tomorrow Well,I suppose tomorrow will do How is Mr Stevens tonight? Oh,he's been sleeping soundly for hours That's a very good sign,you know -I'm glad,good night Mrs Stevens -Good night Any luck? No,she said he was asleep Oh,I am probably worrying about nothing I think so Sorry Oh,these women drivers There's an engine running in there Well? What was it? One who forgot to turn the engine off Women drivers My Chris what do you mean? We'd better tell Mrs Stevens I heard your car stopped Is there something wrong? There's an engine running in there Oh,that's impossible Listen Yes,it is I wonder Perhaps you forgot to turn it off I haven't used the car I don't understand I'd better get my keys,thank you so much for telling me Wait here it might be dangerous, the place might be full of carbon-monoxide Oh,please don't trouble There's someone in there There is,nonsense, how could there be? There's something in there Well,I think I'd better get my keys It maybe too late is there another door? Just round this house Did you see her face? -Chris,do you think he -Yes,I do This is dreadful -Who do you think -You'd better go and get your key Stevens Stay out there I'll get him up -Arthur,what happened -Keep outside this place is full of gas I said to myself what was the revolver for She had it her drawer,I didn't know Be quiet Tell your story later I think you'd better tell Jones to wait Oh look -Is he alive? -I don't know,better get a glass of water No,you stay here Molly Scotland Yard What's going on here? He's gassed,we found him in the garage Oh,Arthur Better get her into the house Where you the one that found him? Yes You'd better go into the house too Look after him,Wells Better phone for a doctor It's Dr Ardee three doors down All right,get him This is terrible Killed himself Steady Mrs Stevens Do you think he'll die? We must wait for the doctor I think you'd better tell me exactly what happened There's nothing to tell,I don't know anything about it Mr Jensen heard the car running in the garage I thought Mr Stevens was asleep upstairs When we opened the door he I was afraid this was going to happen He's been so ill and discouraged He's been set doing it for a long time But I never thought he meant it If only I've listened he might be alive now You didn't hear Mr Stevens go out? If I had wouldn't I warned him? Wasn't he a sick man? Wasn't I worried about him? I'll never forgive myself for this Is he? Mr Stevens is recovering Got a match? Well,that's that Arthur needn't strain himself I'll tell you Besides he doesn't know the really interesting parts I see We really came about your revolver,Mrs Stevens Revolver? Of course It was used to murder a man Yes I'll tell you that story too -I can see Mr Jensen is longing to help you -Jensen? Mr Jensen was an innocent victim of circumstances -Shall we go? -Yes Wells,look after these other people,will you? -I must warn you that anything you.. -It's all right let's go So long I'll see you all at the trial Or will I have two?
