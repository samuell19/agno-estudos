Where are you? The Masi tree. The Masi tree The love inside me Will set you free When I don't define love By the Masi tree. I look everywhere and see I look everywhere and ask myself "Is it just a nightmare?" Dreamless dreamers There are no stars here There are doors that open To a place behind the sky But the computer Catches fire inside rainbows As all the lovers dance And completely disappear. Lovers. Dreamed? It's early. What time is it? It doesn't matter. Do you love my shoulders? Yes. What part of my body do you love the most? -My feet? -Mm-hmm. My back? My hair? My nose? My lips? Everything. Everything? Mm-hmm. Forever his inspiration We've always been a team But the artist is nothing Without his muse He sees the beauty of life in my eyes It's all a beautiful confusion. Are you going to be like this? You think it's interesting? What is this face? Again, look at me. Don't move. I didn't do anything at all. Look at me. I can't photograph your soul. I can photograph your space in a way. Uh, it's... something with your body language. The way that you move. But the artist is nothing Without his muse Marker. - Set. - Good. And... Action. You know, I've seen everything Taschen has put out this year. It's good. Thank you. How hard was it for you to find and decide on the photographs you wanted to collect -and use for your book? -Hmm. Are you fed up with celebrity life? It wasn't hard at all. I never liked celebrity culture. And I think-- I think there are a lot of talented people that I like. I mean, I love to know about the people who create things because, um, it helps me to understand the things that they create. The butterfly Who fell in love with the bee We-- We stand-in lovers Dancing blissfully In cerulean skies The one who always flutters Wandering wild Wishing on endlessly to be free And the other Bumbling, busy Laden Over-pollinated with love.

How much did you miss me? A lot. Tell me I'm beautiful. You are beautiful. Dance with me. Dance with you? Where? Here? I can't dance. Come on. Am I your favorite girl to photograph? Hmm. You're my-- You're my favorite girl. I want to know who you are. You still don't know? Not always sure. I don't know what's going on in here when you look at me like that. I don't know what's going on in there. What are you thinking about? A lot of things. Weird things. Tell me I am your favorite girl to photograph. You're my favorite girl. I love you. Have you changed since your beginning? I don't think in those terms. I think photography has changed a lot in this last 15 years, especially with the digital things. Anyone can take pictures now, but what I can say is... ...I don't take pictures. I make pictures. Your father was a famous painter in the 1980s. He died at only 30 years old. How did his art influence you? I have a great admiration for what he did as an artist. Photographing faces is more complex than landscapes. You can't act afraid, Nicolas. You must be in control. -Excuse me. -Hi. Would you be okay with my kid taking a picture of you? Of course. Go ahead. You going to be a photographer when you grow up? Take pictures of things that inspire you. If you see something beautiful, or something that catches your eye, then go for it. Don't hold back. What inspires you? That music right there. I love you the most. Do you want me to say it to you? Yes. Say it to me. No. You know, what can an artist do to grow creatively? To-- evolve? Everyone has to find their own path. And what's your path? It's a constant struggle with oneself. Um... I love you. Do you believe in fate? Only when everything good happens to me. - Kiss me. - I am gonna kiss you. Give me a kiss. Stop teasing me. - Am I? - Yes, you are. We missed you today. Had a really good time with Matilda. - Yeah? - Yeah. We talked about going to Brazil. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Brazil. - Yes, yes, yes. I'd love to surf the waves out there, man. Life. I mean, everything has an influence on me. Women, men. You. Um-- You have to steal because if you don't steal, you cannot really do it. I mean, there are people who think that they are original, but, um... they are not. I'm curious about your portrait of the famous writer, Terry Collins. You-- You bring something new of him. Uh-- A coolness I've never seen before. What is it that you put from your personality into your images? Nothing is personal, Nicolas. Everything is personal. Every moment of my existence is personal. -I'm a person. - I've worked with you since you were 17, and this is ridiculous. Maybe you need a vacation. How do you feel? Don't lie to me, Nicolas. And everything is bullshit. I am trying to help you. You know you are my number one. Our number one. The world sees fashion's superficial. It's a strange world of business, you know? Do you know how many copies my book sold? The client was unhappy with your last-- -Fuck the client. -But we have to work with these people. It's part of the job. They want something new. They said your photographs were-- were too dark. Not enough colors. They wanted to have fun. They said your photographs don't pop like they used to. You were a thousand miles away. You need a creative reset. I don't know. Take Matilda to Europe or something. Try something new. Yeah, I don't need your help. Do you really believe you're at the top of your game? -Fuck it. -Okay, we're done here. Great. Can you define what you do? No. I don't want to define what I do, and I don't like to define what I'm doing. Um... I create. That's it. So what's your next project? I'm still working on it, but you'll be the first to know. Do you even have another project? Here we go. Quiet, please. Thank you. Roll sound. Thank you. Sam's meeting you. Butterflies usually attempt to accumulate around the base of the tongue. They don't hold their tongue too straight like other types of flies. They curl it and... even more remarkably. They can put a sharp bend in it. These butterflies have got pollen, not necessarily on its tongue, but all over its pretty legs as well. You once called me your "Eternal Tiger." Cassandra was my greatest love. These flowers will fade and wilt, our love... will not. We both thought we would spend our eternity just together. I think dreams do come true. If you believe... I'll never leave you Nicolas. Her actions eventually altered parts of my subconscious. I do feel dreams come true. I do. And changed the way I view relationships. I just showed you exactly what our relationship is. I hate who I become when I'm with you. I can't live with you anymore. So here we are... wasting my fucking time, wasting my life away with you. I feel like I'm suffocating in this relationship. Suffocating! Yes, I fucked him. I fucked him. So, it's finding balance between, um, life and art. Honesty always gets my attention. Not particularly someone who is honest to me, but someone who is honest with himself. I'm very proud of you, you know? Hmm. Take it in. I'm-- I'm really proud of you. Yeah, but still, I want to be something more. I'm lost, man. What do you mean by that? But I want to be free when I create. Mm-hmm. -Free yourself. -How? Let go... ...have fun? -Do you remember what happened? -Mm-hmm. You became a photographer. You were obsessed with taking pictures. I envied that, man. I really did. -I know. -I do. -I do. -It's not enough. There's a fashion bubble that needs to be burst. Fashion photography holds me down. What do you mean? I don't know. I feel like a liar in a way. I get it, man. I do. -You know? -It's crazy. Just... You got to find it in you, you know? That's the tough part. Impossible. I was never interested in people who doesn't do anything at the end of the day, and just wears high heels and spends too much time in front of a mirror. I don't know what you're talking about. I have to be completely honest with you. I need to know how you grind your beans. I just taste your beans, coffee. How do you feel about being unfaithful? What do you want me to admit? Unfaithful is just a word. -Tell me. -This coffee is shit. What do you mean? The truth is my life, but... sometimes I just want to escape and be alone, you know? I think that's normal. I mean that there are no meanings and words are just words... where it's like... relationships. Love. Marriage. Unfaithful, cheating. Fucking. Yes, I fucked him. Why do you put up with these antics? I fucked you. Don't you see how empty all of this is? How empty you are. How was the party? It was good. You came home late. -It was a good party, -Did Cedric have fun? I think so. Did you call your mother back? I think it'd be good if she stayed with us for a couple of days. I'd like to get to know her better and last time she came it was a bit weird. Weird? I didn't know it was a problem for you to speak to your mother. Why are you shutting me out of your life? What do you mean? This is life. Mm. Is this the last gasp of a dying artist? Do you believe in fate? Are you serious? If I'm honest. Which I try to be. Only when everything good happens to me. Hey. Do you want some coffee? -It's Serena. -Tell her I said hi. Hey, Serena. I am gonna get ready for work. I'll be right back. He went for a wave, and... he went down, and he... Do you remember Sophie? Who? I don't know. No, no. Can we be serious for a moment because it's really important? -I need to tell you. -Yeah, I am listening. You are? Yeah? -Sophie. -Mm-hmm. -Paul's mom? -Oh, yeah. Paul's mom, man. Yeah. -Paul's mom. Fuck. -Paul's mom, dude. -She was hot. -She was hot. What? It's just that... I don't know. I mean, she kind of looks like Paul. She does? Yeah, a little bit, I mean... -Yeah. -No, she doesn't. - No. - But tell me about it. I got-- I got the no. Ah. The greatest sadness is not being able to kiss an invisible woman. We cannot touch it. I think we should go. -Where's the key? -You know where key is? I don't know. You were just driving. Sorry. I am so sorry. You look so much like your father. Why don't you come with me to New York for a couple of days? We talked about that, remember? And it's not a good idea. Why? Because it's not. I'm loving you. I care about you. You mean everything to me. And I don't have anything else. - I am sorry. - Okay. - I love you. - Me too. I don't want to be without you. Look... Okay, come here Take care. Take care. I can't believe I'm never going to see Cedric walking over here again. Nothing means anything anymore. I know. This is fucking chaos. Please don't leave me. I won't. - I can't do this all alone. - I know. I know. What's wrong? Everything's wrong. What do you mean everything? I want you... to fuck... You're home. I love you. It's okay to be lost. My dispirited lover Your patterns Are fading. I'm wandering Wistful Nicolas Where are-- Thank you. I feel pretty good. Is something bothering you? Photoshoot was crazy. You argued with the clients. You left the studio. It was very awkward between you and the model. How is your life? Are you still in love? It's complicated. We still love each other, but... Come on. something is broken. Look at me. So what? Clients are usually uptight. What happened? Well, you need to impose yourself just... take control and don't give a shit. Don't be so aggressive, Nicolas. Don't move. You're just gonna stare at me and judge me, right? That's-- That's your position. How do you live like this? Yes, he seems to be changing now. You know, I don't care anymore. I have been disrespected for a long time. Okay, that's good. Move up. Are you afraid of me? - Maybe you let me out. - Are you scared? Oh, I hit a nerve. You okay? You are so mean to me. Fuck off Nicolas you fucking little brat. You're fucking selfish. Do you have any secrets? You make me sick! This is not what I want. Do something new. I have seen this. Do something new. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. I don't wanna shoot with you anymore. You're making me crazy. Don't touch me. How do you live like this? Let me out... Aren't you afraid that people are going to see what a fraud you are? You know what I see? Fear. You waltz in here... like you're some kind of magician. Hey. Hey, what are you doing? You're pretending to ask me what am I doing, but the real question is, why am I doing it? Right? Why I am working? Yeah? Because I can. I am sorry. I am sorry. Let's drink wine and make love. I'm gonna go outside first and get some air. No. -Nicolas, stop now. -No. You're hurting me. Shh. Please. Hey... Something you can fix. Hit me. No? You like that? I break things. You clean up. No? You don't like it? Okay. I don't want to irritate you, but you're an artist. You write poems. You are good. Yeah, so? You can't even believe yourself now. You want to teach me how to live my life? You want to teach me how to survive? Go ahead. Come on. Come on. You believe that you are better than me? You are not better than me. Forget about us. We don't exist. Get out of my face. -Fuck you, Matilda. -Hey! Fuck you! You know what it is, Nicolas? You're afraid. And you can't even see it because you're so arrogant. Fucking look at yourself right now! I am sorry. Stop it. -Don't fucking touch me. -Fuck off. Get out. Go. Let me work now. It's 8:00AM! Stop it. Are you daydreaming? You don't know shit. When are you going to get fucking real? And you better get real, fucking fast. Matilda. Hello? Matilda? Hello? Are you Nicolas Yarna? Are you wondering where Matilda is? I'll ask you a final time. Are you wondering where Matilda is? - Do I have your attention? -Yes. Meet me at the Hotel Vista Tide at 9 p.m. Room 1009. 1009. The door will be open. Do you understand? What the fuck is this? Did you hear something? Where is Matilda? Good, you can follow instructions. Where is she? You keep asking the wrong questions. Besides, anticipation is the greatest pleasure. If you don't tell me where Matilda is, I'm going to-- Do tell, Mr. Yarna. What are you going to do? That's the sound of a man realizing he's not in control. Who is this and what do you want? Where is she? Is she okay? When things start to feel strange, you should stop and check your surroundings. When things start to feel strange, you should stop and check your surroundings. It's a lovely dress. Unfortunately she wore it under those circumstances. Are you wondering where Matilda is? Do I have your attention? Yes? Don't worry. It's easy to lose when it's weighing us down. Darkness extinguishes light. They can coexist. The light has left you. Do you know where she is? She's lost. All luminescence, eventually, fades to this. Are you daydreaming? I know what you dream at night. I don't ever want to hear your voice again. I apologize. You were looking for some peace and quiet. It's okay. I haven't seen you here before. It's the first time. I spend too much time here. Did you know the only part of the human body that requires sleep is the brain? You can... run, walk, fuck... twenty-four hours a day. Just the brain that can't keep up. I'm most tired when I travel. I'm so excited to leave. But... when I arrive at my destination, it's my brain. There's a tough time adapting. I'm Hannah. Nicolas. It's nice to meet you. You too. May I tell you a story? It's funny, I promise. When I was 16, there was this 31 year old that I was dating. On a trip to Norway, we found this small town surrounded by 100 tiny lakes. All of a sudden, I... I felt the urge to make love with him for the first time. I was still a virgin. That part of the forest was dangerous because there was a species of man-eating wolves. I undressed... he entered inside of me, and we were waving our flashlights and making all these strange noises so that the wolves would stay away. I dream about that sometimes when I'm making love to other men. And when it happens, I... have to stop having sex. Because my burst of laughter goes on without ever coming to a stop. I'm going to go for a swim. You have a secret. I'm psychic. Relax, you can tell me. Relax. - We all have them. - I've lost something. Something or someone? My girlfriend, she's gone. She's left you or she's gone missing? I'm at the hotel because I got a strange phone call. I hoped it was Matilda. Who was it? I was beginning to think it was you. No, that's too cruel. Even for me. I went to this room and I got a call... but it was cryptic. And you have no other clues? Nothing. That there's nothing to be gained by being here? You coming? I have the package for Mr. Yorke. You are an hour late. I understand that. I'm sorry. He's here to learn. No more mistakes. -Hello. -Thomas. This is my new friend, Nicolas. Nicolas. My name is Thomas. How about a drink? Scotch, bourbon, rye? Soda pop? Are you having a glass of scotch? Maybe. Come in. Sit down. I've missed talking to you in person. When did you get back from India? India? Uh, about a week ago, I think. I was there for six months. India. Have to go back in January. Thank you. -Nicolas. -Thank you. And where are you from? I was born in Naples, but when I was ten, I moved to New York. Um-hmm. Where are you now? I'm in Los Angeles. Where are you? Where are you? Don't you mean I just told you? Was New York stressful to you? Uh, no. Uh, I like to change. I used to travel a lot. Nicolas is a photographer. So you're an artist. Ah. So you're an artist. I'm interested in people. What are you most afraid of? I don't need to be analyzed right now, but thank you for your interest. Uh, are you afraid to see who you really are? Is it because you are afraid to see who you are? Strange. I see you're interested in people, but you are cut off from yourself. Living and dying. Identical twins in the Matrix. Shadow and light. Light and shadow. You know how that feels, don't you, Nicolas? Excuse me. If I say childhood, what comes to mind? I think it's time to go. - What? - I think you heard me. That's enough. We're going. This was a mistake. Sorry. Good night. Wicked people of the night. Mr. Yorke doesn't like it when his plans change. Wicked people of the night. I'm beginning to... forget the shape of your face... Where am I? I hear things... you once said to me. Spoken. by unfamiliar faces. We're alive when we just fall from the sky. It was an almost perfect wave. I got this feeling, this rush, like... I was a part of everything. You know, I didn't exist anymore. And I froze. Time stood still. What shape is your heart when it's really, really broken? There is no shape. Because it's an illusion... until you know you are... Why do you feel life is strange when it gets really strange? What if I fail? We loved. From hate. Stop it. Don't fucking touch me. And because we set things on fire. What if... I took it and it was the ride of my life? I knew I'd never have that chance again. Where are you? It's okay to be lost. Where is she? When things start to feel strange... you should probably stop and check your surroundings. Hannah. Is she dead? I know her. I have been working with her. You are the woman on the phone. I want the truth It's your turn now. Who do you think you're fooling? I mean, what is all this charade? The least you can do is be honest with me. Where's Matilda? I don't know. Since I saw you in that black and white movie, my life was unraveled. What are you talking about? I don't know. Do I need a lawyer? Only guilty people need lawyers. Never mind about her. Shadow and light. Take care of yourself. - Light and shadow. - Now. Identical twins in the Matrix. You know what I see? Fear. I see a scared little shot. You know shit and you better get real fast. Let me guess. You have never seen the victim before your in your life, right? What's your relationship to Hannah? There's a hell of a lot you don't know. When was the last time you saw her? You're that pretty boy fashion photographer, aren't you? You're the one that takes all those pictures of that gorgeous girls for Details magazine, am I right? You hate Details? No. I've read about you. Seen all your interviews. Talking about the truth like you intended. So I got to look people in the eye, criminals, thieves, liars, degenerates. I got to look for the truth in their eyes, day in, day out. Usually, I don't find it... but every so often. I see the truth... and I know it. So I'll tell you what. Why don't we start this again... and you give me some of that truth for a change, huh? You're a photographer. You think you see the truth, but you don't. Your camera sees it. I don't got no fancy camera. Now get the fuck out of here. Go. Oh, one more thing. Aren't you afraid that people are going to see what a fraud you are? Butterflies usually attempt to accumulate around the base of the tongue. They don't hold their tongue too straight like other types of flies. They-- These butterflies have got... not necessarily on its tongue, but all over its pretty legs as well. "Know thyself, for thou knowest his power: then put on a new mind." Where is Matilda? You keep asking the wrong questions. It's a lovely dress. Where are you now? Where are you? Hello, Nicolas. When was the last time you heard Matilda's voice? What the fuck is going on, Hannah? No, you-- I am Kate. You met my sister, Hannah. Your sister? My twin. Do I really look better on the telephone? I don't know what to believe. Did Hannah kill Margaret, then? No, don't be silly. I don't know what's real. But when was the last time you heard Matilda's voice? Do you want to hear it? Do you want to hear it? Do you want to hear it? Do you want to? There's one thing you need to know. - Where is she? - No, okay. Your emotions. They mean nothing to me. I want you to play this. I told you not to try to find me. I'm sorry. Take me to her. I know what you're thinking. So, who is he? Someone she fell in love with? Someone she's fucking? Nicolas, did you ever really love her? Think about it. Hey! Nicolas, give me your fucking money. - Calm down. - Shut up. The love inside me... will set you free when I don't define love. I look everywhere and see. I look everywhere and ask myself... Hey. I feel pretty good. Where are you now? You say you're interested in people, but you are cut off from yourself. Who is this man? He's not even supposed to be here. Where are you? Dreamless dreamers. There are no stars here. There are doors that open to a place behind the sky. As all the lovers dance... and completely disappear. Nicolas, where are you? Dreamless dreamers. There are no stars here. Nicolas, where are you? Why did you save me? I don't decide. God put you in my way. He who fights. That is my name. Do you ever think about death? When I was at war, death was all around. I'm afraid of death. But I'm afraid of everything, really. Fear... is always there. I no longer waste my time learning about things I have no control over. I had a girlfriend. But I was lost and unhappy. And when I felt her love, I was ashamed. So she disappeared. I don't know where to go. But you have known all along. Nicolas. Stop the car. Nicolas. Matilda! Tell me what's going on. You hurt? Are you okay? Matilda! Where are we? I can't explain. Weird things happened to me. Yeah, that was the plan. What plan? What plan? I almost got killed by a man. You were saying that it was part of the plan? I almost got killed by a man, and it was part of the plan? Are you crazy? -I did it for you. -For me? I know it's crazy. Okay? I had to do something. You are destroying yourself. I did it for you. I don't know who you are. I know it's crazy. It's a crazy fucking plan. But what the fuck did you expect me to do? Before I disappeared, I kept having this dream. And in this dream, you were looking for me, but you could never find me. And I was there and I screamed. And I would scream and call for you, but you'd never hear me. The greatest sadness is not being able to kiss an invisible woman. We're standing right next to each other in the darkness. Nicolas. Before I disappeared, we kept trying to define what love is. I am trying to label it, give it a meaning, but love can't be defined. It wasn't working and I was so lost. Do you understand? I was so lost. Sorry. It's okay. There's so much distance between us. I found you. I am sorry. You saw things, didn't you? I can't explain. Weird things happened to me. You can't explain... what you saw. But you can say that you've seen. Are you Nicolas? ...thousand miles away. When was the last time you heard Matilda's voice? -Where are you? -I saw you. He's here to learn. Are you wondering where Matilda is? She just disappeared. - It's okay to be lost. - Where are you? I love you. Matilda, I found you. I've been here all along. The messy tree. The messy tree. The love inside me... Will set you free When I don't define love By the messy tree. Look everywhere and see I look everywhere and ask myself "Is it just a nightmare?" Dreamless dreamers There are no stars here There are doors that open To a place behind the sky But the computer Catches fire inside rainbows As all the lovers dance And completely disappear. Love. Thank you. Where are you?
