Can I have a cigarette? What happened to you? I have French or Dutch paper. What do you prefer? Are you French or Dutch? It's much more complicated than that. Where are you from? From Jerusalem. Wallah. And you? Dekel. - The Negev? - The Negev. I'm Dutch and Palestinian. I'm French and Israeli. Actually, I am Turkish, Greek, Russian, American-French, and Israeli... and Jewish, of course. You know the new Palestinian complex is about to collect as many ID papers from different countries. I thought it was an old Jewish strategy. In fact, I never lived really in Holland. I only have the passport. Are you married to a Dutch? I was. For papers? For love. And then I became a saleswoman for an international corporation. Then you kicked the Dutch because love and work don't go together, right? It's the travel. You know, this nomadic life? One day here, one day there. Yeah. We're all essentially Bedouins. Then one day... He told me about all the horrors that I subjected him to. Passport? Well, a demanding job can make you be very egotistical sometimes. Yeah, and then you lose your intimacy with the closest people to you, and they wonder if they matter. Anyhow, actually I think we belong to somewhere else. It's weird. Yeah, I'm the same, by the way. I don't always like to get close to people. Only sometimes, you know. - Sometimes yes, sometimes no. - Say something in Dutch. Everything is very temporary today, you know? I don't speak Dutch. I only have the passport. I'm Palestinian with a Dutch passport. What are you, precisely? What do you mean by precisely? What's your nationality? Palestinians have existed for centuries. Isn't this precise enough for you? I don't understand. Just answer my questions. What does he mean by precisely? How can a nationality be precise? Look, do you have a problem, huh? Look, what she means is that national identity is abstract, and you're requesting for some specific physical representation. Give me your passport. Your passport. Take the passport. Forget him. He doesn't know anything! Where do you go? To Avignon. But everything is written. What are all these questions? Maybe you don't like Avignon so much, huh? Why? I heard it's a very nice place. It's a port. Yeah, it's Provence, but do they have good wine there? Huh? What about the region? There is some not far away. Yeah? Is it good wine? Listen, I ask the questions, okay? Of course. With all that goes on in your region, I can't help wondering what you two are doing together. You know what? I don't like to disappoint you. It's nothing political. Yeah, we're just both of us on the same train, that's all. Nothing symbolic. Have a nice trip. The Gaza disengagement in summer? That will be a mess. Is our unit ready? I want to know if everybody in our unit is ready. Can you hear me? Evacuating in summer. I'll be back in time. We'll talk later. How's your migraine? I didn't have a migraine. I said that out of convenience. I couldn't exactly tell Fritz that I felt lazy. I slept. I sleep here whenever I get a free moment. Plus, I am fundamentally lazy. Probably because of despair. Don't you practice any sports? Oh, I hate sports, a little tennis. Look at you. Amazing. What about your husband? He'll come for the funeral. That's what Fritz said. Do you want to see him? - Come on. - All right. Are you okay? I don't know. All I can say is that... a relationship I never asked for... has come to an end. I am not gonna live in my husband's house anymore. Already been here ten days. It's been horrible. Every ten minutes, he would look up to make sure I was still here. Then yesterday, he only checked a few times. But during the whole time, he never said a word. So it was you who sent me this telegram? "Just to inform you of my death. Signed, your father." No, that was Fritz. Everything was planned in advance, even the singer. At least he loved you. Hey, he never loved me. I don't know why he made me come. Anyway, I stayed in my room as much as I could. Then he decided to die when I was sleeping. He just wanted you to feel guilty. Or maybe he wanted you to wipe his forehead, because that's what's done when the father passes away, and he just didn't know how to ask you. Maybe. - It's weird. - Yeah. And when I got here, I decided to leave my husband. Have you told him? No. What? No, it's not what you're thinking. There's no one else. No! No, no, no! Everything looked great from the outside. Never even an argument, every penny shared, living together, nothing more. So... If you leave him, you'll be at fault. So what? When is he coming? Tomorrow for the funeral. But I don't want him to sleep here. I can take him to the train station right after the funeral if you want. That'll make him furious, because he wants to sleep here. Who inherits the house? Well, Dad left a file. Everything should be in it. We've been sleeping in separate rooms for years. Can you imagine? Why didn't you leave him before? Oh, um... He was Dad's student. It was complicated. How could you stay with a man you didn't love? I told you I'm lazy. You couldn't stand him? Yeah. You know... I didn't think about love. I told myself that he wasn't mean to me, so he'll do. Imagine you were raped. You could either stay depressed or manage to forget it all. But you hesitate. Is that so terrible? Don't you think it's humiliating to live with someone you don't love? I don't know. Now that I'm telling you, I wonder how I managed to go on for so long. Probably because in my eyes, I'm not worth much. Ana, who are you leaving him for? Oh, no, is it bad to leave without taking a lover first? I'm tired. Me too. Where are you going? Bed. You going to bed? I'm going to bed too. Fritz made up your room. I'll sleep downstairs. Oh. Uli? Uli, Uli, Uli. I'm here for the obituary in the local paper. - Have a minute? - Yes. Thank you. Sit down. Move closer. Closer. A little to the left. A little more... Now turn the chair. A little more... Closer. Don't be afraid. That's it. So your father was born in New York State in 1925? Twice divorced, two children. You from a first marriage, Uli from his second. To be precise, Uli was adopted by my father. At the time, his mother and my father were already filing for divorce. She wanted to go and live in Israel, and he didn't want to leave France. That's what she told me. Is that enough? Did he die suddenly or after a long illness? Regardless, he definitely continued to publish articles in magazines. But he stopped teaching. "Holding on until the end his vigor and youthful spirit..." Very nice. "Born in Albany, New York, in 1925. "After participating in the Allied landings in Provence, "he was an international law professor in Aix-en-Provence, where he taught several generations of students." - There's something missing. - No, it's fine. We could say he was a man of principles, a decided European. That's nice. Make yourself at home. Feel welcome. Thank you. My condolences. "With his passing, our city mourns the loss of an eminent citizen." Very nice! - All fine? - Very. - Satisfied? - Very. Everything will be done just as the professor wanted. You know that he wasn't easy. Here's the contract. Everything was planned. Cremation... Funeral, staff, coffin... Floral arrangements... Name, location, date, sex, occupation... In case of any dispute, our company declines responsibility... It's the law, unfortunately. Just sign that you agree with the arrangements. Where do I sign? - Is that all? - I'll do the rest. Come on! Come on! Do you remember that time you nearly drowned? Came down to the dinner table, teeth were chattering like crazy. I had a bad fever. You were only allowed soup. That's right. Soup was the only thing anyway you could take with that fever, but still. It felt like a punishment. Yeah, but nothing mean about that, right? Just following the rules. I never could understand that. Why even try? I don't know, probably because I'm dumb. You're not dumb. I always had problems learning. I always misunderstood everything. Well, that doesn't mean anything. I can't even absorb what I do understand. I'm hopeless. Husband is worse than Father. Discipline requires all thoughts to perfectly align next to one another. He's right. I remember once one of his students translated a piece by Shakespeare word for word. Husband corrected it by replacing it with some... published translation. But what the kid had done was beautiful in its own way. He had translated the words just as he had found them, like a pile of fallen stones. "Cowards die many times before their deaths. "The brave never taste of death but once. "Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, "it seems to me most strange that men should fear, "seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come." Et's go and see Father. "My... "Daughter Ana... "Having... "Received her share... "Her share... "The rest... "of my estate... "Will go to... "my adopted son... Uli." The letter As don't look right. That hasn't changed since my childhood. When I lived here, I was afraid to dirty or break anything. How are the letter Us? The Us look good. The 2s look good too. Like his. What are you doing? Nothing. Can't you speak in French? I don't want to. Well, there's still something to do. What now? Changing the will. What are you talking about? Well, and what if I told you that I already received my share from Father when he was alive? You know, I checked it. It only takes a couple of words changes to make it look like I got my share already. Just have to write... Why would you do that? Why? You think I can't do it? I will. But this one is not right. What do you think you're doing? I know what I'm doing. Don't interfere. That will never pass. No one will notice. You can't be serious. I can't concentrate. Come in. It's so weird seeing you. For someone else, this could be very exciting. I don't know. Hey, what stops you from watching me like any man? We're not really brother and sister. I'm joking. Joking. I know you're very busy, Françoise. I found this will among Father's things. I thought you'd want to see it. "My daughter, Ana, "having received her share, "the rest of my estate will go to my adopted son, Uli." I knew your father a long time. I knew him very well. This is a fake. Why would it be fake? Have you read it entirely? I've felt overwhelmed these past days. I'm legally obligated to ask you to inform yourself consciously of all its details. There! Sorry. This isn't simple formality. Here's a will whose authenticity I have no reason to contest. Read it. Since she was born, since the very beginning, he always knew. That monster. Your father's instructions are very clear. Your daughter lives in Israel, precisely in a settlement near Gaza, and she will only receive her share if you give it to her personally. She and my father knew each other? They loved each other very much. She's a teacher. She's happy. He visited her almost every year. Him? Tell mine. When she was abandoned... I don't want to talk about that. But we're not here to speak about you, Ana. I don't know what I would have done if I had been pregnant so young, alone in a kibbutz, no family, no friends, but there was this little girl, and your father found her. He looked after her. What do you want from me? I just wanted you to know. What's her name? Her name is Dana. I'd like to introduce you to the funeral party. No need to present your husband. This is the dean of the university. My condolences. Your father was a friend. I admired his university work. - Very kind. Thank you. - His wife... My pleasure. The city representative and his wife. Thanks for coming. The doctor who cared for your father all these past weeks. I wish I could have done more. - Of course. Thank you. - His wife. - The journalist. - Yes, we met. - The funeral director... - Yes, of course. Please walk ahead. Yes... Yes, ma'am. You say your son is against the Gaza disengagement? Well, no one asked his opinion. The work is almost done. The windows need washing. Then I think you can go. Move along! Gonna take Father's car... put it on a train to Italy... then in Trieste, I load it on a boat to Ashdod. You're leaving me. I don't matter to you. I need to be in time for the disengagement in Gaza. You can join me later if you want to. I want to go now. I won't have a second for myself over there. You can stay at my place in Dekel if you want to, but I won't be able to take care of you. But I'm ready. I'm ready to go. Can I come? Can I come? - Yeah. - Yeah? Uli, wait for me. I'm coming down. I'm ready, yeah. Uli, I'm ready! Don't go away without me. I'm coming! Is that the car? And no permit? It'll be fine. Listen... We'll take the Volvo and Yoav takes the Jeep. Don't make my decisions for me. Hey, what's the problem? No problem if you come with us and leave the Volvo. You have a briefing. You can brief me on the road. Why are you giving me a hard time? Get in the car. The keys are inside. You're too hard. The road blocks have made a mess. Let me handle this. Just listen for a second. Tell me. I brought my sister. I want her to come with us in the Volvo. You think this is some kind of tour bus? For some excursion? Hey, lady! You can't go in. He's my brother. No, this is a police car. Tomer, she has to go to Gaza. Forget it. Are we going to the same place? I made a lot of detours because of you. We're late. I'll get blamed. Get in the Jeep. I'll just put my bag in here. Tell her no. Handle this yourself. She's going to the settlements too. Just like us. Plus she's a settler? Why are you bugging me with this? Get in and stop being a pain! My brother just died. No, my father just... I have no problem with you. You can't come with us. You can't. We know that. She's your problem. Because we're going together... Listen, listen to me. There is no way that the Volvo can get inside the settlements right now. They don't let any cars get in, and you can't... and you can't go in this car, okay? So I'll call a friend of mine, Dani, a good friend of mine. His name is Dani. He'll come here, okay? Wait for him here, all right? He'll come... he'll come here and get you. Don't worry. Sorry. Okay? Sorry. I don't speak Hebrew. I was sent by Uli. Are you waiting for someone? - Are you Uli's friend? - Yeah. Why are you so furious? Did you lose anything in Gush Katif? What are you looking for there? My daughter. Hi. - I'm authorized. - To go where? To join my unit. - Is the car authorized? - The permit is coming. - Show me. - It's on its way. - Are you authorized or not? - Yes, I am. I can't let foreign plates in. - I'm a policeman. - Where's the car from? Back it up. Hey, let us in. Move along, please. He's authorized. So? Who do you think you are? Are you lecturing me? He's a policeman, a friend of mine. Can he go in? Don't complicate things. Hand me the radio. I have a policeman from special forces with a French car. Can he enter? It's okay. Open up. Can I go in or not? Go in. Yoav, can't you drive? Back up. Thanks. You've been very kind. No problem. Can't you drive? Are you crazy? Don't you look before you move? Are you blind? Look at what you did! You're crazy! Imbecile! What have you done? - Didn't you see anything? - I'm sorry. Get out of here! Idiot army! What did I come back for? Hummus country! Screw your mother! And your father! What are you looking at? I brought this car all the way from France by train and boat. Without even a scratch! It was too good to be true! Idiot army! Stupid settlers! What the hell am I doing here? Go back inside! I said back inside! I won't go to any briefing! I won't! Shit! There's no way to fix it. It was my father's. All this because of those settlers! Damn it to hell! Let them leave on their own! It's ruined! Army of fools, country of idiots! No one gives a damn! You could have killed someone! Imbecile! Is that how you'll evacuate the settlers? Is that "sensitivity and determination?" My ass! Damn it! I've had it! This is crazy. Unbelievable. Stop there, please. Where are you going? Not too far away. You can't pass. This is a military zone. She has to get through. Your papers. Here's mine. Sorry, I can't let you through. She must get through. Turn off the engine. He's not authorized. You can't pass. This is a military zone. Turn around. She must get through. She must find her daughter. Can't you hear? It's impossible. I told you, she must get through. Stop being stubborn. Stop her! Itzik, watch him! Don't let him run off. Oren, bring her back. Itzik, keep an eye on the zone. Oren, bring her back. Adi, help him. Watch him! Adi, take care of the gate. Oren, control the zone. Go please inside. I asked you to leave. - Calm down. - I am calm. Why so aggressive? Aren't the wars enough? I asked you to leave before things turned badly. - Calm him down. - You heard him. The army, wars, what's it all about? During the Kippur War, there was a guy like you, only a meter from me. His head was blown off by a missile. She has to find her daughter. Let her through. I'm trying to explain to him that you have to meet your daughter. Speak to him. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. Speak to him. I don't know what... I need to see my daughter Dana. She lives in Neve Dekalim. That's all I can say. Be human. Please, let me... help me. Let me go. What harm can she do? Come here. Let her through. Her daughter is in Neve Dekalim. She hasn't seen her for a long time. She doesn't look dangerous. I think that we can let them pass. What's the risk? Guys, have you seen the time? Come on. How long you didn't see your daughter? Now you want her to tell her life story? Make up your mind. Open up. Bye, guys. Stay alert. So here we are. I hope this guy, Rafi, can take you to see your daughter. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm not sure you'll be so happy when you get there. But we'll see. Rafi. Come here. Dani, why are you here? Doubtful for our support. I brought this lady. Ana, Rafi. She's looking for her daughter somewhere in Gaza. Can you help? Anything for you. Heard about the mess? They're chasing out children, pregnant women, whole families... Maybe they're not supposed to be there anyway. Let's just hope it all goes well. Join us by the fire. I have to get back. It's late. Help her, okay? Come over. I'll bring you through. Take my bag? I can get it. Maybe take some things. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Where are you coming from, which country? France. French? They like the Jewish there, huh? Okay, come have a seat. They're gonna take care to you. You can sleep there in the tent. Form a chain! Prepare to push forward! One! Two! Three! Stand firm! Prepare to push forward! Make way for the horses! Close back! Let's move on. Now run! Run! At this hour At this merciful hour Your will can open any door In front of You God won't abandon His people God won't abandon His land God will help us God will hear us God won't abandon His people God won't abandon His land Up, up, up, up. Come on, come on, come on. Up, up, up. Listen up! Starting tomorrow, staying in Gaza will be forbidden to Israeli citizens. This means evacuation begins tomorrow. Today we will give the settlers their evacuation orders again. A reminder: Israeli press will be present, as well as from the whole world. You are not authorized to speak to them. If they question you, respond politely. Direct them to your officers. - Is that clear? - Clear! Another thing: You must remember that these evacuees are part of our society. They are not our enemies. Conduct yourselves as civilly as possible. Show how sensitive you can be. Is that clear? Good. First thing. Your officers are there to assist. Don't hesitate to question them. We will do everything possible to assist you. You will not be alone. Anything to add? Now, for a military exercise to evacuate the settlers. The Jero group, here. The Iris group, come here. Hit the ground. One woman, one man. Arm, leg. Arm, leg. Show me an evacuation. Rapidly toward the bus. 3, 2, 1... Go! Go on! Keep a tight hold. Now run! Hurry! Toward the bus! Too slow, Iris group. Put him down. Gently. They are Israeli citizens. Everyone back in place. That was good, Jero group. Iris group, you need practice! A reminder: Your officers will be at your side. Don't worry about that. Anything to add? Guys! Our mission is to only uphold the law. That's our role, but... if we need to use force, then we will. Gladly. Russo, come here. Say that to the press and we'll be apologizing for a week! Then keep the press far from me. Listen, with these people, we're not obligated to use force. We can explain to them. That was only a simulation. Incidents could arise. Tomer! Avner, go on. What's wrong with you? Why are you so nervous? Calm down. Uli, what do you want? - For you to calm down. - I am calm. That's it, guys. Go and prepare in the tents. I'm in the middle of a divorce. Then do it calmly. See? That's Dana's house. God bless you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Form a chain! Tighter! Stand firm! Your force shouldn't be wasted on us. Not against us. Rabbi, you asked for two hours. I gave nearly three. This isn't easy. Not for us, not for you. Let us in so we can evacuate calmly. What are two, three hours? They are on their land. They were born here. They have been living here. I gave them orders. Israel, I asked you to open the gate. I know and love you. Know how much? I can't give the order to force the gate. Our resistance is legitimate. We won't raise a hand to anyone. I promise. You'll make us use force. I promise you. - Open the gate. - I will not. Form a chain! Form a chain! As I swore, no one can break our faith. With God's help, through our songs and prayers, the soldiers and policemen will retreat. Let us read the psalms. Prepare yourselves! "I look to the mountains. From where will help come?" Form a chain! Soldiers! Policemen! Disobey! Stand firm! I'm Ana. What? I recognize you. You came here? What? What's the... what? Sorry. I'm sorry. Can I... Have a little... I'm sorry, I... It's all right. This is my greenhouse. I have been cultivating things inside here for years. Basil, za'atar, parsley... Mint... All kinds of herbs. It smells good. It grows well. They're the neighbor's flowers, but I water them. That brings in a little money. Soon, I'll plant others, bigger ones. I don't speak Hebrew. Why not? Father didn't want me to speak Hebrew. He wasn't sure about his origins. He's strange. I met with him a few times. I know. And, um... I have to tell you that he passed away a few days ago, and, uh... He... he... you're in his will. He wants to give you... his belongings, so... I came here to say that to you and to see you. I'm... very happy here, to be here. It's a shame it won't last very long now maybe, but... I don't feel I need... It's a shame. You want maybe to make tea... with this, with the nana? Yeah? Okay. What is the flashing? It is the... the light of the army. Maybe we can pull the curtains? Yeah, but... Better? Yes. It's time for you to take the Torah out. Israel, Rabbi, the Torah should be taken out now. I want to say something. Et me speak. It's time to take out the rolls of the Torah. Just a few words. Pass between the rows! Let me speak to my community. A few words! No violence, men. A few words to my faithful. Soldiers! It's time to take out the rolls of the Torah. At least show respect for the taking out of the Torah rolls. Respect the exiting of the Torah rolls. Allow me to say a few words. Where are my faithful? Come. Closer. Respect this sacred place. I look at you... and I see only pure souls. A true family. A family of heroes. All of you, even the soldiers and policemen. Our family wears no uniform. But it is of the highest rank. The highest. Fine, Rabbi, you've made your point. Men, now it's time to move forward. Let me finish. It's a parable! Let me finish. It's a parable. Lady! Stop and hear me out! Passers-by among passing words, take your names and leave. Give us back our time and go. Take what you want from the sands of memory. You will never know that you do not know how the stones of our earth build the roof of the sky. Passers-by among passing words, you bear the sword, we bear the blood. You have steel and fire, we have stones. You have bombs, we have rain. But the sky is the same for all. Take your share of our blood and go. Passers-by among passing words, it is time to leave and settle where you want. But not among us. Leave, die where you want. But do not die among us. We shall use our land. We have the past, life's first cry. We have the present and the future. We have the under here and the over there. Mom! Come here! They're Arabs. Don't speak to them. Dana, why are they destroying everything? Wait! Wait! Wait! Yael! I need three girls with me. Go toward the bus. Put the children on the bus first. Another unit needed to take these people! Take her away. Ana, Ana, Ana, Ana. Leave me alone! You leave me alone! Ana, Ana, Ana. - Don't worry. - Leave me alone! Leave! Leave me! Leave! Leave me alone! Please, please stop. Leave me! Leave me! No! Get off me! Get off me!
