Lock it up! Captioning made possible by home box office ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the big house, "the house of pain" as it's known. This is the jailhouse band.

This is the administrative area of the jail. Anna M. Kross center, as of 7:00 this morning, had 2,691 inmates incarcerated here. It's, to our knowledge, the largest detention center in the country. This is the processing area for new admissions coming into the system, for any inmates being transferred in or out. Hey, yo. What TV is that? Hbo. Hbo? What's up? Gangster Lou in the house from Morristown. They pick you up this morning? I've been here since Tuesday. Not in this little place. Man, it's hard as hell. We've got to find him, right? Put your right foot back up, please. Put that against your stomach. Let me see that ring. Is that a wedding ring? Yes, it is. Leave it on. Go ahead. Put your hands up. All that is ass and tits. Go over there, ass and tits. Ha ha ha! How did you do that to yourself? Implants, daddy. When did you do it? Oh, about three years ago. They house you with the men? Yeah. Excuse me. Hello. Sir. Step around. The police said I had... in the report, said I had five knives. I didn't have no knife. I was playing with my kids. The constitution gives you the right to bear arms... and to protect your property. What arms? I had a knife. So? How you been? Any trouble in the institution because... No. I love every minute of it. I was in the women's house. I was with dykes. I love every minute of it. You're in the chain gang now? Yeah. What's that? Scar. From what? Jail. I got into a fight and got cut. Everybody! Take them to the yellow line, gentlemen. See you later. Let's get the rhythm. See ya! Take it easy. This facility houses the more violent inmates in the system. Each side consists of 75 inmates. There is one correction officer on each side. There's four inmate telephones, a shower area, a... 1 guy for 75... One correction officer on each side, yes. What's going on in here today? Same as usual. Doing time, man. Huh? Just doin' time, that's all. That's it. Just doin' time. But back over here belongs to the Spanish people. This is the way jail runs. If you're white, you can't survive in it. Spanish and black. That's how it is. Puerto rican flag, baby. Back is for the Spanish, front for the other people. What if a white or black guy wants to watch your TV? He can watch, but he can't touch it. He can't touch the TV, though. He's got to sit in the back. This whole area's the puerto rican area? Yeah, the whole back section. The front is all blacks. So sometimes it'll be, like, a racial thing, you know? So to keep the peace in the house, the Puerto Ricans have their own section, the blacks have their own section. Same thing with the phones. We have... We have the four phones... Two puerto rican phones and two black phones. That's so there won't be no problems with the phones. Can you use that phone whenever you want? Yeah. Any of them. But everybody can't do that. Because you're tough? I just got my respect, that's all. You need to earn your respect here. You don't have to hurt nobody. Just how you carry yourself. Hold on a second. What happens if you're a wimp? You get to make a phone call for, like, 10, 15 minutes. You don't got no time. You stay on as long as you want? Yeah. Hi. How are you doing, darling? I'm O.K. All right, gentlemen. This afternoon, we'll be searching block 8 on the "a" side. We understand there may be some contraband hidden in some mattresses. Direct the inmate what you want him to do, then do a good search. All right. Let's go. All right. Listen up! This is an e.R.U. Search. When your gate opens up, you will strip down for the officer. You will not shake your clothes in front of his face. There is no talking during this search. These officers are trained to defend themselves. If you have a problem with this search, you will be escorted out and an infraction will be written on you. If you resist, necessary force will be used against you. Crack 'em. I give you this one? Lift them up. Lift your fingers up. Let me see the bottom gum. All right. Good. Get dressed. You got one? What have you got? Looks like one. Pull it out. Here's one. It's sharp enough. See, it's old, but it's sharpened at the tip, so they were just working on it. You put a handle on this, this will do deadly damage. A small one. Where did you get these gloves... from work? Where do you work at? Mess hall. What's this? Where did you get this from? Mess hall. That's just kool-aid. He works in a mess hall, so apparently he's taking excess for himself. But that's a normal habit for them. It's considered contraband. O.K. We got a weapon. Have him come downstairs with the mattress. This weapon was found in this gentleman's cell. We're having him handcuffed and brought down for rearrest. What's your name? Michael Santiago. Behind the bed frame. There's, like, a rim around the bed frame. Can I take a look at that? This is relatively new. What's happening with this fella here? We found this shank inside his mattress. Looks like a long screwdriver, and it was sharpened at the tip. I don't admit that. I got that 2 days ago from cell 20. I switched my mattress. You can tell that to the adjudication captain. You taking them? Yeah. What were you in for originally? Murder in the second degree. What can they do to you now? Throw me in segregation, get me away from my enemies. Where did you get the weapon? I made it. Out of what? Out of lead from the floor, from the, um... The brass expansion joints? Yeah. Are there a lot of those weapons around? Yeah, there's plenty. Have you ever been cut or stabbed before? Yeah. I've been cut right here. Where? On my face. In north facility. For what? For, um... for some jewelry that I had. With a razor blade? Yeah. I had a big gold-nugget watch and a big nugget ring with diamonds in it. They tried to take it from me, but I think it was more a racial thing, though, because it was all blacks. O.K. So I need a pass to go back? He telling the truth? I believe so. Most of the information he gave me I could verify, anyway, based on his criminal history... He didn't seem very remorseful. He's not going to be. As he said, he probably needs it for protection. He must have enemies. If you were locked up, would you try to get a weapon? Of course. Swing it over, fellas. Watch the cart. Watch your back. Close that north gate. Put the visors down. Relax, relax, relax, relax. Relax. Go inside! Get inside! Get the camera out of here. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. It was just a simple assault on staff. The inmate probably didn't want to be housed in this particular area, so you assault the officer, you get a new housing area. Why are these guys up against the wall? So that they don't get involved in anything. I came to assist the officer that was down, and we had to take the inmate down and remove him from the area. You saw nothing? Are you willing to sign that? Yeah. What did he do, punch you in the eye? Above the eye, yes. He must have brushed my nose. I fell, got up, tried to help the other officer. How you feeling now? A little shaken up. Sit down and relax. This guy, uh... He just assaulted a doctor, hit a doctor with a chair. He hit a doctor with a chair. I had a fight, and I was bleeding from my nose and was asking for medical attention, and I got tired of waiting for it, and I swung on him. I swang him with a chair. And after that, the... The c.O.S beat me up. I restrained an inmate, and as I was restraining him, he turned around, pushed me, and punched my face. O.K. You all right? Yeah. This is just... Ha ha! This is just an everyday life, a daily routine. Every day? Morning, noon, and night. That's not fair, you know. I came here bleeding by my nose, I'm supposed to get attention, you know? I was waiting. He's the doctor. He told me, "no, I'm not the doctor." When I'm bleeding, I swing him with the chair. He's supposed to have compassion for his neighbor. That's what Jesus Christ teach. Jesus Christ doesn't hit guys over the head with a chair. I'm not Jesus Christ. I'm Estivio Espina. I'm not Jesus Christ. Take him down to the receiving room. We're here in mod four in the ardc, which is the institute's reception and detention center. Lying over there is one of our most interesting characters. He's Jimmy Mirabel. He was born in jail, and he's infected with the AIDS virus, and if his case is not favorably adjudicated, he will more than likely die inside our system. Hey. Just don't give up hope. I never give up. I know you're facing a lot of time. I was never in that predicament. I worked in three institutions as a nurse's aid for AIDS patients and watched AIDS patients die, and it's one lonely situation. Nobody comes and sees them. They're rejected by their families. The c.O.S reject them. I seen a guy where they just threw food under the door. The guy wasn't even eating. He just lay there until he died. Yo, listen. If I ain't back in 20 minutes... Be careful. Put out an apb? Yeah. Going to the barbershop, kid? Yes, sir. To let somebody else mess up my hair. How do you feel seeing Jimmy fading like that? It's scary. Being deprived of life and incarcerated at the same time... It's the most horrifying thing of all. I was born here, bro. Born in here? Born in prison. And, uh... I might have to die in here. My mother still use drugs, bro. 22 years. 30-something years on methadone. So what you think? Looks good, bro. Looks good. I can tell you're doing this in the street. I had to support my family somehow. Well, you do good. I wish I'd come down before I got this... Yeah. Looks good. Thank you, brother. You got it. When I hear Jimmy's story, I feel like it might be me if I don't slow down or calm down and... what life's about. Think about it. I don't want to die in jail or have no kids born in jail, either. That's... That's sad, man. That's real sad. This is my job, what I do. Uh, I wash towels. I got to get over there. Jimmy? Yo. What's up, pal? This is my best friend in the whole facility. He's the one who got me this job. You want me to wash that jacket? No. I washed it yesterday while you was in court. Yo, whose coat is this in here? Whose clothes? No. Coat. Coat? Green. That's a stash. Don't let the boss see that. That's a stash. That's how we make the money. Sell that to other inmates? Yeah. Cigarettes, like that. That's how we make side money. We'll wait for you here. What is this stuff here, Jimmy? Setups. Setups. These are for the new admissions that come in. A blanket, towel, two sheets, a pillowcase, cup, soap, toothpaste, brush... A care package. You guys coming in? Nine. Nine in here. Hand me the setups. You going to take a nap? Yeah. Jimmy's... he's fading on us. Um... you see the way he's laying there? Just, uh... this is every day. As soon as we come from work, all he does is lay out, falls asleep. He's not involved with the program like he used to be. He's just fading little by little. He's just going. He's leaving us. He's here, but he's not here. Let the brother go! Let the brother go! Let the brother go! What are they doing? Acting how inmates would act if we were actually taking down an inmate. Let the brother go... Cuff him. Watch his legs. Go! Yeah! Whoo whoo whoo! It's over. It's over. We're going to do one more. Fuck 'em! Five to one! Punk-ass motherfucker! Get up off of him! As soon as they start to charge you, just give up. Don't even fight them. No nothing. You can drop to the fetal position, but don't resist them at all. O.K. He's going to give you a fight. Motherfuckers! This is bullshit! This is the Rose M. Singer facility, which currently houses about 1,500 women. He didn't do it! That lady did it. I don't know how. Pick your tray up. 70% of the women are substance abusers. The women in this line are receiving methadone. They're the poorest and neediest new yorkers. Many have never had health care, many have tb, many suffer from AIDS, and many of them are pregnant upon admission into the jail system. This is building seven, where they house the pregnant women. You see we're all pregnant here. It's kind of uncomfortable, but we make the best of a bad situation. Ladies, can you lower that TV for one second? And this is... this is Jackie, one of the babies from the house. Jackie, how old are you? 22. No. Yeah. I just became 22, August 10th. How pregnant are you? Eight months. I'll be nine months in... two weeks. Would you like to see a shot of my family? This is my daughter. This is my granddaughter. Wait a minute. Granddaughter? My granddaughter, yes. My granddaughter's 3 months old. Yes, looks are deceiving. I'm a grandmother. And, um... This is my husband, who is serving three to six years. My cell, I try to make it as comfortable as possible, but what can you do? What's the biggest thing you don't like about the cell? The nights. The nights are very hot. They're very closed in. They're cold and lonely, and it's scary when you're nine months pregnant and you don't know if the officer on duty is falling asleep. You know, and will anyone hear you knocking? That's what scares me the most. We are grinding soap to, um... To put in the washing machine. It washes your clothes good. It takes stains off your skin and lightens your complexion. That soap's pretty good. Because it's got lye. People sleep with it on. Come in ugly, go out beautiful. This is our iron. We're going to go do some grilled cheese. I'm going to show you. Hey. That iron is filthy. And this is us making grilled cheese. Rikers Island grilled cheese. It come out pretty good. Really? Yeah. Melted up, too. You haven't seen the finished product. Who invented this? This has been invented for years, already. If you'd seen half the things we invented, you'd be amazed. People can survive with the inventions they make in Rikers Island on the street. See that? See? Just like toast. They called my name. Yes. You going to the mailroom, too? Well, I want a mail pass! Ain't got no mail. I wonder if it's my money or this guy that wrote to me. Last time, he asked me to marry him... Ha ha ha! And he's in jail. You always find a relationship when you're in jail. You're sober, you're cleaned up, and every man wants to talk to you. When you go out there, they probably won't even bother with your shit. I hope it's my money. Think that is? Yes. Oh, yes it is! Aha! I got it! Got it! My money! Yay! Today we'll be visiting the gay housing unit here at the George Motchan detention center. It has a housing capacity of 42 inmates. At present, we have 37 inmates housed there. It's a... About a quarter mile walk down the east corridor. Gay housing. Quarter mile down. Building five. How are you doing today, sir? How are you? The first time I saw gay inmates housed together, it was a shocking experience. We're now entering five main. This is one of the two gay housing units. How are you? My name is Chantee Bryant. This is Erica Kane. You can watch her... Channel seven. Channel seven. From 1:00 to 2:00, 5 days a week. This is Murdoch, and this is dusty. How you doing? How come you're in jail? Why am I in jail? Uh... selling drugs. Yeah? And how about you, dusty? I'm in jail for robbery. Why did you guys choose to come to this unit? Um... Uh... I started talking to somebody through a vent from in the cell. We started communicating. We built somewhat of a rapport, so I signed papers and came downstairs. So can you guys have sex? If, I mean... I don't know. What happens? Um... Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can. I mean, where there's a will, there's a way, so you can. Can you, like, actually shack up at night? Not overnight. Not overnight. But you might be able to lock in the cell with that person from 7:00 till 9:00, or something to that effect, and, uh, take care of your business. You know... release some tension. Can you let us through, please? On the cross gate. You can open one cell. This is dusty's cell. You can open one cell. This is dusty's cell. Bed, closet, stuff where you put your newspaper, your books, a dresser to do your writing, um, and so on. As I said, my name is Chantee, and this is my little home for my little short stay while I'm here. Chantee, you've got a lot of stuff. Yes, I do. My family takes care of me. They don't knock me about my sexual preference. I have something I would like you to see. A little bit of how I dress on the streets. This is my everyday effect. That's me and my male friend. This is how I dress on the street. I dress as a woman. My little gap suit from the gap with my matching hat. I like to dress. My mother knows that. When she comes up, she brings me nice things. This is where I hang my jackets at... My suede, silk... gap, of course. This is Kane's cell. This is my place. Uh-huh. You know, it's simple. I'm going to tell how it is. When I get sexually frustrated, I just don't go to anybody. I have a mate. I'll try to sneak up in his cell, but I use protection. You can find these anywhere... Lifestyles of the rich and infamous. Ha ha ha! I mean, you know, we keep these around all the time. The clinic gives... And they come in colors. The clinic gives them out, you know. I mean, you're not supposed to have sex in here, but they figure you gay... But they know what they house in this building, so they give them. Protection... that's the name of the game. If you're in here too long, you feel this is normal. You must realize this is your job. You leave it here. Things we cannot see, we cannot control. See you later.

Grant a motion for me to put me in a 24-month drug program. You want peanut butter and jelly? I don't want that other one. Thank you. Listen, I'm not eating this sandwich. Peanut butter and jelly. Listen. It's hard, man. Jimmy! Jerry, good luck. Am I going out there? No. Just in the interview. Your sister started using drugs when she was with your mother? Yeah. Did you ever get high with her? My first time. She turned you on to drugs? No, heroin. She turned you on to heroin. This is the meeting with the agency that will talk to the judge about samaritan village and persuade him to send Jimmy to samaritan village. Two months in New York, back on I.V. Heroin? And coke. Speedballs? Yeah. We arranged for him to be seen last Tuesday in Brooklyn. Nothing happened. We arranged for him to be seen last Friday in Brooklyn. Nothing happened. He was seen day before yesterday. He was woken at 4 A.M. and schlepped to bullpens and transported around in handcuffs and chains. It's rough on him because he's sick. Jimmy, you're going to stay here for the day. The whole day? I'm going to lay down. You're going to stay here for the day. I'll call you when you got to go to court. Every time they postpone it, I go back. Still a little bit of light. They want to make sure you're going to die before they let you out. Sounded like a fight, right? Yeah. It's the bullpens upstairs. Yep. Yep. They're having a fight upstairs. What happened to my buddy here? A fight. What happened? You got hit in the mouth? Yeah. I'm O.K. You were in that fight with that other guy? Yeah. Why'd you fight? He wanted to fight over a chair. He used the bathroom, and I sat in his chair. He wanted to fight me over the chair. I ain't want to fight. He pushed me. I pushed him back. He pulled out a razor. I blocked it with my hands. He cut me here and here, and he bit me there. Do you have AIDS? Don't got shit. Because I got blood all over me! You got AIDS? I got cut! All right. Can I get AIDS? From what? From a bite... AIDS. Aids from a bite? Only if there was blood in the person's teeth. We had a class yesterday. They gave us a class and film. They said only if there was blood in the saliva. Then it's possible of contacting AIDS. Otherwise, no. Check the guy's dental records. The other guy's mouth was bleeding. Oh, so then... I'd be worried then. Seriously, the other guy's mouth is bleeding. From his mouth? From his lip. He only bit me there, though. You guys see anything? No. No. Beat it! No! Beat it! Turn around. Take everything out of your pockets. Put it on the bench. Turn around. Face the wall. Put your hands on the wall. They handle those guys with kid gloves. If you weren't here filming, they'd beat the daylights out of the both of them. They don't care who's wrong or right. They didn't search the other inmates? They searched the whole cell. What about the people in the cell? They searched everybody. Strip-searched them? Not strip-searched. Normally they'd be strip-searched? They strip everybody down. Since you're here with the camera, they won't do that. Everybody's clothes would have been off. They would have looked up the crack of their asses, checked under their nuts, lift up your armpits. Anywhere you can stick something, they'll look into it. Gets worse. Never gets better. Why did you start using drugs? I guess to just cover up a lot of hurt from childhood. I've been on my own since I was 10 years old. I was a molested child, and I guess it made me numb. It sedated your feelings. Yeah. I started using drugs when I met my kid's father when I got pregnant with my last daughter, my last baby. I did what I had to do to feed my drug addiction. I did for my addiction what I never would have done for my kids. I never sold my body for my kids. I did it for drugs. I'm embarrassed, but it's the truth. I went all-out for my drug habit. Who knows what I would have done for my drugs? It's sad, but it's the truth. I don't feel incarceration is the place for us, because once we've done the incarceration, I'm here as living proof that my time did not help me. I did four years already, and that didn't help me. Where am I? Right back again. My last release, what did I do? I didn't report to my parole. The first place I went was to cop. I didn't go home for days. I hadn't seen my kids in years, and I didn't go home for two days because I was cracking it up. Is your baby moving? It kicks a lot? Nice. I came here Monday, and they gave me a different due date. The 21st. 23rd. One more. Lisa Reynolds! Bingo! Hello. How are you today? I'm feeling fine. It's a baby boy. Boy? Scrotum sac. It's a boy? That's what it looks like. By the sonogram, first thing I said was August 9th. Then from August 9th, they changed it to September 9th. From September 9th, they changed it to September 14th. Now you're changing it all the way to October? I've been thinking about that a lot. I'm scared. The day I give birth is the day I have pains. They don't know what they're doing. They don't even know who I am. How many different aliases do you have? Let's give them the benefit of the doubt. I got two names. But you got a number. Shouldn't that keep this straight no matter how many phony names you gave them? They had me discharged. I'm afraid, because I seen what happened to you. You know what happened to her? What happened to you? I lost a baby. It died in me two weeks. Inside you? They ain't going to have no burial for your baby? They tell me they can't help me. What they going to do with the baby? He's in the morgue. I don't know what they'll do. This is the second baby death died in here. They don't know why the baby died. I don't have no papers, no results. I got a certificate with the baby's footprint. 1 pound 11 ounces? That's how much he weighed? Alls I was doing was crying. They just kept trying to drug me up to calm me down. Alls I do is cry. I can't do nothing else. I don't know if that's my baby or not. They won't help Bury the baby. Sister, I need to talk to you. How are you doing? When's the baby coming? Soon, I hope. We can talk about it. Let's go upstairs. I was doing so bad out there. I was living in cars. Want me to say a prayer over you? Yes, please. Stand by your cells for the count! Nancy! We got to go back to our cell. Gate's open. I just feel so terrible for these women. So many of them don't really belong here. They may belong in rehabs, but they don't belong here. We should get to the root of the problem. Most of these people are poor. Have a seat in front of the captain. Sit away from the desk. This is captain Riley, shield number 334 in jatc. The time is 12:35. Before me is Miguel Santiago. You're charged with possession of a weapon. How do you plead... Guilty, not guilty, guilty with an explanation? Guilty with an explanation. O.K. Go ahead. Well, um, I was guilty of it, but, like, this is my first ticket, and I ain't never been in trouble before. I've been in for a little over five months. Mm-hmm. It was mine. You know, I had it. Do you know the maximum amount of time you can go to punitive segregation for is 90 days? 90 days? Now I know. You'll receive the warden's decision within 24 hours, O.K.? You have a good day. Stay out of trouble, O.K.? I'll recommend that he goes for 90 days. Turn around. Squat. Feet. Turn around. Your mouth. Lock it up! This mattress? That's it. I'll see you in 90 days? All right, man. After a while of being in here, they usually change and understand why we do what we have to do. It's all fucked up... Treating us in here like animals. That's what it is. Bring him down! The inmate coming down the corridor right now is Eddie White. He is a notorious escapist. He's attempted to flee from custody on numerous occasions. He has convictions involving homicides. Well, that's the mind-set how society has me as one of the most dangerous persons here. That's what they want everybody to think, but it's not true. It's not true. Let me see your eyes. You a mild-mannered fellow? Sure. I smile. I always smile. Ask the good officer right here. Officer Lewis. Officer Lewis, Eddie a nice, mild-mannered fellow? Yes, he is. Is he really? Yes. Dangerous? Yes. There used to be a bully on my block, and he used to pick on me, slap me in the head. I wore funny clothes. They took my sneakers when I was little. I got tired of it. One day, I got my father's gun, and I guess ever since that day has really been... I really been violent. If he was going, would you stop him? Yes, I would. Even though he'd try to kill you? This is my whole attitude. Now, since they give me all this time, I feel I'm above the law. The law doesn't exist to me. I have no respect for the law. We call him the rabbit man because he's the running man. Do you guys respect him? Yeah, we respect him, because he be going all out. 1-8 to 8. We on the way out. Running man! Running man, yeah, yeah! You're bad! Yeah. They call him the running man. It says in this order, "attempt escape from the courthouse and found a razor blade in his mouth." So he has it in his mouth. Open your mouth. I ain't opening my mouth. Open your mouth! For what? Open your mouth. Come on. They're ready to start the hearing. You don't to open your mouth? I ain't got to open my mouth. Put him back. We don't know what he's got in his mouth. How you doing, Eddie? I'm all right. I've been upstairs talking to the judge. Yes. He's given me a brief outline of the pleas on the four cases. Plea to a manslaughter in the first degree basically reads, "defendant..." That's allegedly you... "Did, with intent to cause serious physical injury to Mark Clark, shoot Mark Clark with a handgun, causing his death." I don't understand none of the crimes. I'll tell the judge whatever you want. Be quiet! I'm talking to my client! You ain't listening to what your fucking client's saying! Stay out of it! Fuck you, man! He's telling you what to do, and you'll do something different. That's what's wrong with lawyers today. They don't listen to what their clients say. We telling you what to say. That's all you supposed to do. The fact is, you guys never listen. You don't do your job! All you want is somebody to cop out to something they tell you they don't know about. His position is that he doesn't understand what is going on right now. Your honor, I thought we've had very lengthy plea negotiations on these cases, and Mr. White said on a prior occasion that he was not feeling up to taking a plea. My feeling is this is more of his shenanigans. I think that you should seriously consider dismissing the cases against him. He's serving 75 years to life. Sorry to correct you, your honor. He's serving more than that. He's serving close to 200 years to life. 200? Because of aggregate sentences. He's going to die in jail. There's no way he's ever going to get out. There's no way he'll get reversals on all these cases, if any of them. I think we should dismiss them. Thanks. You're welcome, sir. All aboard that's going aboard. Hey, ed! Hey, how you doing, man? It worked. Basically, they dismissed all four indictments. Told you. They're all gone. So it's over. It's finished. Thank you. When are they going to take you back, man? I'll probably go back tomorrow. Well, ed, take it easy, man. All right. Let me shake your hand! O.K. Fucking balls! Take it easy! That dude's a crumb snatcher, man. He ain't no damn good. Eddie beat all the charges. They dismissed them all. Yeah. No thanks to him. When Mr. White started to give some hints that he didn't understand the nature of the charges against him, he was attempting to manipulate the court... Maybe, hopefully, get a 730 exam ordered, which would mean we would have to test his competency to stand trial. This would necessitate him being sent to a hospital where security is at a minimum and maybe make another escape. Bridge is clear. All right, Eddie. See you in a couple hundred years. O.K., cameraman, take care. I'll be back soon. I might be at that party next week. These are mental observation patients. These folks have all been charged with a crime but not yet found guilty, and they are all very mentally ill of different degrees. They say I got a mental problem, but the truth is that I was stealing, and I got caught, and I had five warrants looking for me because this lady got robbed, and she blamed me. When I got caught by the 72 precinct, they found out I had warrants. They put me in the line-up. They got five guys that looked like me. I knew them all. They were crackheads. I was praying the lady didn't pick me, because I didn't Rob her. She couldn't identify me. Look what I did. I slit it when I ran out of coke because it was my birthday in June, and I had nobody to be with. I took this here... my wrists. You tried to commit suicide? Exactly, and I've been shot. Sitting in that cell for so long, you start thinking and going crazy. How'd you try to kill yourself? I'm an epileptic, and I take dilantins. I saved them up for about a period of a month and then took them all at once. Is that the first time you tried to kill yourself? No. No. I tried when I was young a lot... 14, 15 years old, I tried to kill myself a couple times. I got a plan! This is what I'm coming out is a motto that I'm leaving Rikers island with November 23rd. He who fails to plan plans to fail, and he who fails to read history is doomed to repeat it. This kid ain't repeating history, and he's not going to fail. I'm leaving with a program, thanks to the captains, c.O.S, and Rikers Island. You know what I called this when I first got here? Devil's island. Want to come in here? What's in here? The rest room. What are you guys doing in here? Smoking a cigarette. Can't smoke out there. We got to oblige the rules and regulations. Right, Joey? Joey? I got commissary today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's lookout. I don't know why anybody could do this guy wrong. These are the g.P. Cigarettes. These are cigarettes they sell on discount here for us guys that don't have too much money. Thank you, Joey. You know what I find? That jail puts us in a confined place that we got to beg for everything. Understand? Why is it that people with money don't suffer this kind of jailing? He's pretty intelligent, right? He's pretty intelligent for somebody who's nuts, right? I'll bet you if I had money and family with influence, social status, I wouldn't be going through this. It's this system, you know. I'm still wondering why we're all put on earth. For what? For what purpose are we all put on earth? I noticed something about this kid right here. When he's in-between medication times, he's a little more saner than he is when he's on the medication. He could talk now. Know what I'm saying? When he's on the medication, he's like a zombie. He walks back and forth. Every time he sees a cigarette... This is a unit that has 47 cells... Where we house the most disorganized, the most paranoid patients that would not be able to tolerate an open-dorm setting. I'm a kgb operative myself. My name is Abraham Josef. My number is 89592889. Why are you here? I'm here for killing an undercover FBI agent. I'm an associate agent of the kgb. I wrote a book about the FBI exposing their dirty laundry and especially a 1990 plot to assassinate Jesse Jackson and Dan Quayle. This is my cell. The bed hasn't been made, but it's actually a neat cell. I don't have much junk. I have a Hebrew Bible. I have a Hebrew prayer book. What's a nice Jewish boy doing in a place like this? The FBI sent someone to kill me. I had to protect myself. Why don't we start the meeting? There is no right or wrong thing to say. Let's start by introducing ourselves and saying how long we've been here on this unit. Mark Bauer, aka Magoo. I've been here four months on this particular unit. Four months? O.K. My name is Tyrone Wright, aka Sharp. I been here 4 1/2 months. 4 1/2 months. My name is Josef. I've been held here 14 months without a trial. How many people have attempted to kill themselves or hurt themselves in some way? 1, 2, 3. How many people have tried to hurt themselves? How have you tried to hurt yourself? I cut my wrist when I was in c-76. What is it that you think you need the most to help you? I need somebody that's willing to care for me and willing to listen to my feelings and the hurt I have and share those feelings and cry with me. I need commissary money. I need to make my commissary. I need that my expose about the FBI can be published. Hopefully, that will aid me in getting a fair trial. The truth will set me free. I need someone to understand me for being me and someone to love me. My book must be published. The people and the congress have a right to know what their tax money's spent on. Sign off. Now they seeing the belly of the beast. This is the real deal. This is the real deal. This is what you call cell therapy. What's cell therapy? Cell therapy is when you get in your cell and you have nothing to do. You don't have no writing material, no radio, no nothing. Hey! What? Who's that? Me. Me's who? I don't know me. Gonzalez, 26 cell. Don't start, Gonzalez. All right? Please tell the doctor. The doctor was going to give me one. He's got true... ultra true cigarettes. The doctor left. Could I please get a cigarette, please? Thank you. Don't start. All right. You going to lay down? Yeah. Thank you. God bless you. You got matches? No, I don't have matches. Thanks a lot. What's your name again? Charlie. Charlie. Thank you, Charlie. What do you mean, don't start? Every five minutes, they're calling you for something. They don't really want nothing. Bring that to Ted. He gonna give me some tang. Get everything now. All right. Make sure you give him everything. Give him everything you're going to give him. You straight? Yeah, I'm straight. Thanks a lot, man. It's like hell. I don't want to be here. This is not the place to be. We're asking that you take a chance on him. And Mr. Mirabel knows that this is the last chance that he's got. I've never had a client who was born in jail and is likely to die in jail. Of all the people sitting in prison now who have AIDS... who all deserve to die with dignity... You can't look at his past and say, this is someone worthy of that risk. Were you aware he had four felony convictions for burglary? Yes. That this was his fifth arrest for burglary? Were you aware that during this case, Mr. Mirabel absconded? I'm going to reserve decision until Wednesday. That's October 14th at 9:30 sharp. Mommy! You seen your sister? It's a girl? I wanted a little girl. It's a girl. Carmen Angela. They told me it was a boy. She's blond like you. Yeah? Can you find out if they can bring her in? Oh. Oh, wait. Let me... Oh, you don't like grandma? Why? You don't like grandma? We monitor them from outside the hallway. We have to have eye contact. All the time? We have to see them. Bye, baby. Don't cry no more, mommy. It's time that you changed, Nancy. You're going to be 30 years old. You got to to change for your own good, for your daughters... For that beautiful baby you have. Look at that baby. Do for her, please. They told me that the baby was fine yesterday. And then, today they tell me that one kidney's lower than the other. They got to run more tests on her. She can't go with me. The left kidney should be on this side, but you can see it down here. Not only is it lower, but it's also towards the right, midline towards the right. It could be a consequence of maternal drug abuse. I don't want to leave her here. She sleeps with me and everything. They put her little bassinet next to me. She sleeps next to me. I've gotten so attached. She's the only thing I got. I'll take the baby now, and then the nurse is going to talk to you about the discharge instructions. O.K. Thank you. Let me have your hand. Stop crying. It's going to be O.K. O.K. All right? I'm all right. You sure? O.K. Ramos, stop crying, O.K.? It's going to be O.K. Come on. O.K. Ramos, Ortiz. 4120 Manhattan Avenue. Flores. What, she dead? There's something wrong with her kidney. They will run tests on her, though, right? Yeah. I hope you be O.K. It'll be all right. Hold on. The faith is still there, O.K.? I got a lot of faith. I'll see you upstairs, O.K.? All right. We have a new baby, ladies. I got my baby! Where's the baby? All right! She's in the nursery. O.K., Carmen. This is your new home. I'm not happy about it, but I promise you once we go home, we're not coming back. O.K.? I promise. I know you deserve better. O.K. Hands behind your back, please. Good luck, Jimmy. Do you think the judge is going to show any mercy? I really don't know. Maybe because he has AIDS, he may get more mercy than somebody else who may not have the disease. I have ordered the release of incarcerated defendants suffering from AIDS. In none of these cases, however, did the person released have a criminal history approaching the gravity of Mr. Mirabel's. The motion by the defendant is denied. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Aah! ♪ ♪ Aah! ♪ They denied it. They denied it. So? They denied both my motions... To dismiss it and alternative incarceration... No drug program... no dismissal. So you're going to jail. Going upstate. So that means you're basically... You're born in here. Now I'm going to die in here. Born addicted to drugs... And now I'm going to die... In this motherfucker. ♪ Aah! ♪ Don't start lecturing me. Shit. Jackie, what are you doing back? I got busted again, selling drugs. How long was you out for, Jackie? A month. A month... why, Jackie? What about the baby? Where's the baby? The city got her now. The city got her. This was an inmate that was in building seven with me... Had her baby in the nursery with me, went home in December. Were you getting high? Yes, she was. I got high a month after I got out. She was getting high with a baby. She needs a drug program to care for her child when she gets out. Who says she's leaving? This is her second time. That's sad. And I can say that because I feel like you a little sister to me. O.K. Look at you. You left here looking so pretty. You had it all going for you. You smoked it up. Ain't nothing like your freedom. It's pathetic. What can you say to make me understand this? What you going to tell yourself, your baby in the future? I can't even understand it myself. How can I make anybody understand it if I can't understand it? All right. Watch the gates.

I lasted out there two months. Got myself a nice drug habit, which was crack. I was selling it. I was using it. I was doing anything to maintain my habit and support my kids... Which was whatever. I want to ask... not the people because once you're set on your ways, you know what you're going to do in life... But for the kids out there, which are our future... I want to ask them, please don't do this to yourself. Get an education. As harsh as mom might sound, listen to your moms. This is not the place. It's a lonely, cold place. O.K.? Don't do it to yourself. You won't know what a nice, warm hug is at night. Don't come here. Ladies, stand in front of your cells for the count!
