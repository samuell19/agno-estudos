We say something like this in Mexico. Small hometowns big hell. What you see all day everyday I mean it's what you become sometimes. You don't want to talk to much about this kind of stuff because you never know who is listening you know what I'm saying? You are in risk. I don't lost just friends I lost family but it's just the reality bro. Some people thinks that it's hard in the neighborhoods Man, you don't have idea. I been through some stuff I don't want nobody to experience never. When I was a kid we was getting into a store when we started like hearing some this, like shotguns. And one friend of my dad he was fighting another guy with, with machine guns My father have to cover me and take me to the floor. People killing each other because the war. The war is there everyday. For me this is about life. I mean I don't have anything else. Fighting is the only thing that I have. They get more swollen after driving? Yeah, a little bit, you know. Look, looks funny right here you know... But I mean what you can do you know just Keep doing it. This is the chair I used to sit with when I used to live in this house with my Aunt Susie "Alma". And I work in three different times here in Juarez. One when I was like kind of a kid, I used to be the one who pack stuff put stuff in the people's bags and give it to them. And I used to have tips for that and that was when I was a kid. Then after that I used to work in the water commission with my Aunt checking the stuff in the floor you know, the numbers and stuff by GPS. The third time that I work here in Juarez was doing some in the natural store working the back. You guys can have an idea where I used to work. Come a long way ‐Yeah, come a long way yeah So you guys are more welcome to sit. I'm not standing up because of my foot, I have ice on my foot right now. But, you guys are more than welcome to sit. Panther! Panther! Panther! One of the most exciting fighters in the UFC period that has come on in the last several years. A guy who is coming off a win over Andrei Fili with a just a vicious face kick knockout. The guy throws techniques that most of us couldn't even imagine. A massively unpredictable fighter. Now growing up for you though, obviously was really unique I mean, You know I looked it up, you grew up in one of the most violent cities in all of Mexico. And you lost a lot of your friends to that city too You lost friends who died in some of those activities. Your hometown Parral is right in the corridor right to Juarez where a lot of these cartels you know, a lot of that drug trafficking takes place Very very dangerous... And now you've escaped all of that. And you're going to fight in the main event in Salt Lake City. You've become a star in the UFC and you're going to be in your first main event... The tram is now approaching the shops at Crystals To access the alley inside a casino, please hold onto a hand rail. It's the first time that I've been all over the place like Argentina, Mexico, Salt Lake City, Chicago, Vegas... Like, all like in a period of three weeks. So it's been crazy, crazy, crazy for me. This is my first time it's been this busy and crazy. I just feel like my muscles are so tight right now, that's why I have this little ball, you know to Get my muscles relaxed and then have a good workout. I always say this before my fights, you win your fight in your training camp when your training... I mean... Doing interviews and that kind of stuff that doesn't going to make me a champion. This sport is crazy, I mean... You can be fighting top fifteen guys then you fight for a championship. Fuck man, it's just a rough sport. This week with Marco is just basically just reinforcing everything he has been doing I mean there's not much to do, just to... Get him very comfortable to cut weight and For him to go out there so he can go out there and perform at the highest level. And just for Yair, just to Keep on working man just trying to find times in this busy week. It's tough because he has a lot of obligations but it's part of his job and this is his job you know. [Hitting pads÷\} My English is not good, you know I'm learning. I'm new in this country, I have a couple months here. So I try to be better in my language. And sometimes when I try to you know Have relationships with another people, it's like you can feel the stop, you know. The people is like stopping you like, they don't want like friendship. They don't want relationships. They want only, you know, the work and that's it. For example in this country it's really hard when you try to make some relations with some people And the people is like the other culture, the other nationality. It's really hard because sometimes the people, people is racist you know? Mexico is the country next to, the neighbor of America, but at the same time we never lose the identity. I can see here in this country sometimes the people is like they don't care. I'm heavy coach... 166. I'm twenty pounds so I'm not bad. We are like thirty six, thirty four days right? Thirty four days from the fight. Once I start like eating good... It's going to be good. No worries? No worries, nah. I always miss home bro, it's just... Hard to be in another country with another culture Speaking another language, where... I'm by myself here, I have my friends and stuff like that, but it's not the same thing as having your family, your real family. And it's uhh... I mean all of this is for a dream, you know? My family knows that, I know that. I mean... For now I just enjoy what I have for now, I enjoy my time like watching this spectacular view in Vegas with the fireworks, fourth of July. It's just amazing bro and... I mean I love, I love this country as much I love Mexico because this is the country that give the opportunity to be here and work for my dream, you know... Everybody is trying to survive and uhh Everybody is trying to be free bro too. This city seen my first trip with my family out of my country. I think it was the only one that we have as a family to this country. Being here and seeing all those lights is just amazing bro because my mom just told me that she, she has thoughts about me being here. She never knew for what. I wish they were here like everyday but... I know you can not have always what you want. I mean, life can not be that easy right? It just can't be. I'm just here for them too, to bring them a nicer place or you know, to buy them stuff. This is for them bro. I am never going to stop never, I don't give a shit, until I die. Training some details with Luiz Claudio about our opponents stuff, good stuff like where are they good at, what kind of positions, what are our weaknesses too. Marco is going to fight in two days now. The jiu jitsu game that we have already, Marco and I is good we know that, but it's not that good as it can be. Tap, tap. Put your forehead on the ground. There you go now pressure on the shoulder. Shoulder pressure, keep driving, drive hard. He's already off. Nice! Nice. Nice! Push that knee... I mean I just want to get these guys the best training we can get them you know because if you can afford it, I mean why not? Sometimes that's the major issue with these fighters, they don't have the money to afford a lot of coaches but I mean... Some of these guys have tourist visa's you know so they'll come for six months let's say at first for a month or two months get better get better and build some confidence then eventually gravitate to the big leagues. Right, and if you don't win you do have to go back home though? Well yeah, I mean of course, they got to make it you know. I would say it's not just a pleasure but the honor you know to work with the which I love it so much. So your going to see a lot and these guys definitely going to make a lot of a noise and get the belt for sure. It's coming, belief it! All right now moving on now to the bantamweight division Marco "Pscyho" Beltran versus Reginaldo Viera. 136 for Marco Beltran. Thank you Yair. You have any words for Marco? No, he's good. He looks amazing bro. I think he's going to finish this fight is what I really think. The fighter is gone. Let me try to get it over to you... Ok? All right. The vehicle is already gone so you'll probably have to make your way over there. Yeah we can grab a... we can run there. ‐Yeah yeah yeah... He'll come in and have the corner sheet and he'll... Thank you sir. This is the guy with your wristbands. He's at the arena. ‐Ok. You should go up, make your way up... Yeah he's in the MGM. ‐He's in the arena? Make your way over there, you got his telephone number rather than waiting here because you'll have to come back here and then go... You should be over there, just give him a call and locate him that way. ‐I appreciate it sir. Yeah I can't leave here unfortunately so I can't take you there. ‐Ok thank you no worries. Taxi dude? Where can we get a taxi? Taxi sir? Back inside. Yeah they don't pick up anywhere but the taxi stand. MGM in the arena... In the back... No, no, not this one, the other one. I mean a lot of people has stereotypes about Mexican people. And then they say we are always late, and it's funny because it's the first time we are filming a documentary And now we're late because we're never late. And now we have to fucking grab a cab and go to the MGM arena... We don't have wrist bands yet so... Fuck. Watch out! My fighter, Marco Beltran, he's fighting right now. Bro, I'm serious you have to put camera down. Marco, how are you feeling before your fight? Pretty good, excited... Bro I'm serious... Dude, they are going to kill me... Well Marco Beltran is yet to taste defeat in the UFC. He wants to keep that run going But he will be in for a scrap tonight opposite Brazilian Reginaldo Vieira. Another talented Mexican making some headway here in the UFC. Mexico city's Marco Beltran making his third UFC appearance tonight, so far pretty darn good. Much like his good friend and training partner Yair Rodriguez, I mean this guy brings it each and every time. Right hand lands for Vieira! And now an opening for the Brazilian Vieira! Oh! That up kick landed. ‐Oh no and he's hurt! - Stop! Stop! - There's the tap! Marco Beltran continues... His assault on the UFC bantamweight division. Huge win for the Mexican tonight. A great fight. ‐Take a look at those two hugging each other, when those two... Marco Beltran and Yair Rodriguez, when they fight you want to watch. Declaring the the winner by submission due to a rear naked choke. Marco "Psycho" Beltran! I fucked my toe up yesterday. I don't know what happened. Got stuck in one of these mats... And now... I don't think that I broke it, I just think it pops out a little bit and then we put it back into it's place. And now it's just purple, so I think we're good. Not this dude... It's nothing, not a big deal, it's just sore.... couple of days then that's it. All right, does that happen pretty common in training like little toes... Yeah it's a very common injury man. Fingers, toes, all that... It's just it is what it is dude. I mean, no big deal. So it's been a long week, he's a little bit tired so, we got a couple more hours of Reebok, that Toyo one was a little, a little tough. You know your in camp and it just throws everything off being on the road and... You know hopefully when he gets home takes some stress off his back and starts focusing on that five round fight and I know he's going to perform, I know he's going to win. Want to go over there? Yeah man, I'm fucking it was two fucking hours. Fuck. - You got badges? - Huh? Who you with? He's a fighter. That's one thing we just don't want to do with him is stretch him so thin that ya know, that you lose focus on whats this about, this is about... You know, kicking ass and taking names and making money And at the end of the day the fame will come with it But we really have to make sure that we are focusing on what got us here and I think that's what a lot of athletes lose track of and I know Yair is not that guy. But as his team, you know, we work as a unit so... We're gonna make sure as this kid works his way to the championship, when he becomes champion, we're gonna try and just focus in on what we need to To keep that belt and and ya know maintain our status as the best 145 pound fighter in the world. My body right now, you guys don't have idea of how I feel right now. That's why I'm doing this kind of stuff, you know, because my body is so tired I can not feel my legs, I can not feel my shoulders, my core and stuff like that, it's just hard... But if you decide to stand up and fight against life too... I mean the only bad thing that can happen is just you just keep fighting all your life. Then you're going to be a fighter. Then you're going to be a great person because you're going to learn. I have been like been a lot of mistakes in my life, I did a lot of mistakes in my life when I was younger. But life is like that, like how you can learn if you don't do mistakes? You learn about your mistakes, about people's mistakes. You have to kill or be killed. You know that's two options... Or for me at least it's like that. Have to go there and finish my job. Do you want music today or quiet? I think I'm going quiet. ‐Quiet today? Yeah. See it takes the form of your ear that way the water doesn't go in. And you can actually not hear anything but your mind, but your self, which is good because... Who you are when you are with nobody, who you are right here... That's the important thing. Know what, who you are when you are with people when you are with your cell phone and stuff, that's not the real you, that's the guy you are trying to be with people, the cool one. The important one is who you are when you are by yourself alone, without music, in the darkness. What are your thoughts right there? Sometimes I'm afraid of that to because... How it can be bad, it can be to good, you know so... That's what I'm trying to do right now trying to let my thoughts be positive... as powerful as I can right now and... Just make that happen in real life, so let's do it guys. Let's go guys, hurry up hurry up hurry up. If God shows what he has planned for us dude it would boggle our mind. If you could see the doors he's going to open the opportunities that will cross our path and the people that will show up in our lives... We will be amazed, excited and passionate for victory. You got to believe it before you see it, and then you have to go and achieve it. Up to this point it's the most important fight for us, you know and... We just want to do things right, you know and not make it an issue where the altitude might effect us or anything like that, we don't want to have no excuses. Seventeen days out... I'm not trying to focus on building muscle with you, at all. That point starts earlier in the training phase. At this point your in your cutting phase, your cutting weight. We're trying to keep the mobility, the functionality, the speed, the quickness and still benefitting from the workouts at the same time, so... We're gonna get into it. Ready? Go! Go! Good good. Pop it out, good. Again, good good. Yeah! Come on! Come on! Hit it! Chop chop. Quicker quicker. Come on. Hit it, come on, come on, yup, yup. Aghhh! Yeah! Let's go, ten seconds, nine... There we go. Eight. It's nothin, let's go... Get it up! Six, five... Don't do it. Four, three. Nice! Two, one. Aghh! That's my guy, nice job. You ok? You look better this time around then you did last time around. I told you... I think this training camp, I don't know what it is, the diet or something... I'm the only fucking Latin American guy that's traveling all over the fucking country. All of fucking Latin America bro... These guys aren't fucking doing that shit. ‐Right. He's from here. All he has to go, fucking Latin America, fucking fly twelve hours to fucking Argentina... Fucking four hours to Mexico. He don't fucking have to fucking do that shit. He have to fucking travel from Miami to Salt Lake City maybe... ‐Right. For all that stuff. Do media in fucking Miami. He has all that shit here. My market is in Mexico. My market is in Latin America. ‐Yeah so you're dealing with two different markets. Yeah. Let's get it done man, we gotta find some way to get it done. Let's get some food prepped. You can't fear anything, and I think that's what gives Yair the most upside. You sometimes hear things like, "he can't do that, you can't do that..." I mean, in my opinion that's a bunch of bullshit. The number one is just the confidence of not by any means you overlook anybody, but you understand your long term vision and your long term goals. And, you know, ultimately your competing against yourself. Good, get those legs in, use your legs. Roll under that leg. Scramble, make him work. Time! One minute... Good job. That's a hell of a lot of action. No, that's not a fucking good job. - He win that fight. - Huh? He win the fight first round. Ready... Go! Aghh! Seeing what the fuck happened to me? What'd you say you were going to do? You said you weren't going to shoot a double leg. Then don't shoot a double leg. Aghh! Haha... Yeee! Your foot? Your toe? Come on you motherfucker... Time! Cool down, good job... Cool down guys... Cool down and stretch each other out. I'm almost on weight right now, I'm three days before my weigh ins. So its one of these ones, one macaron and some pieces of power snacks. And then I have a surprise for one of my coaches, I just call him today, I used to train with him and then, he... He used to don't charge me nothing for go and train with him. I used to sleep in his house. He was pretty important part... He called me like three or four days ago he's like "You are not the only one, like making your sacrifice, we are doing sacrifice for you too so..." "Let's go and kick this fucking guys ass." And I was like "I will try man, I will do my best let's do it!" I just buy a little piece of land in Parral, it's not huge you know, it's a small piece of land... But I'm going to try to build a house there, I want my fathers to live there if they want. That way they can rent the house they live right now or they can rent the house I'm gonna build... um... You know then they can stay there, they can keep the house. I mean, at least they have a place to stay. For the people who doesn't know me, I'm from Chihuahua, Mexico. I'm going to fight Alex Caceres August 16th, next Saturday Alex "Bruce Leeroy" Caceres and it's going to be a good fight. "How you see the fight will go between you and Connor McGregor?" I think it's gonna, I mean probably if I fight him someday, it's gonna be a good fight because... I respect him so much, I look up to him too, he's one of my inspirations. I think he's pretty good and... And he has power and hr has this crazy stuff too, and I just think that it can be a pretty interesting fight between him and I... "Waffles or Pancakes?" Pancakes bro, I love pancakes. We get him closer to the fans, closer as possible. So in this case he's doing a twitter Q and A for the UFC Network account, you know for Latin America. And after that, he will be doing a Facebook Live for all of the global accounts. This is what you just did People thinks it's just Connor McGregor in the UFC, and they are always asking me about Connor McGregor. I mean if you to ask something to him just ask him, don't ask me about him. And they ask me if I'm afraid of him, I mean I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid of nobody... And they say if they think that I can beat him? I mean I think that I can beat everyone you know in this world, in this earth. I mean everybody is human, I don't know why I can not beat him, you know? We love idols, we love Mexican fighters, boxers or MMA fighters now, so he'll get there. It's not easy to be a professional athlete in Mexico. My song to come out of this fight is going to be it's a song of my state of my country. When I used to talk to my parents it was like "Come on man, I'm here in Parral... Parral is a small town, nobody comes here." I mean, just you know, nobody is interested in MMA fighters here. Like, why should I dream more than this? I don't know what's going to happen you know, I don't even have visa. It was 115 guys that are trying to be a part of those twelve selected to go to Albuquerque. So I was one of those guys and the UFC just fix everything because like... I mean anyways if I was trying to come here to the United States I didn't have the money to come fix my visa or stuff like the you know... And not even the time because I was working, so when? That was awesome, thank you for doing that. Thank you man. Yair Rodriguez is a great opponent, I like opponents that push me to my limit, that can really test my meddle... And he's definitely one of those guys that will, you know, show me what I'm made of so umm... I would like Saturday to go all five rounds. I trained for five rounds... I've trained so long for this fight that I would like to make the most out of this fight and get the most time inside of the octagon as possible. Right, and any words for Yair, your opponent? Good luck and I hope you have a good performance against me and let's get fight of the night. Right now he's starting to becoming a big idol in Mexico because he born in Mexico, he knows his country, he knows his people. And then hopefully in the future when they retire they can go to Mexico and spread all of their wisdom about mixed martial arts in Mexico and then we don't need to come to the United States but, you know... That politicians can say whatever he want, like we don't... We don't care that much because, of course we're not paying for a fucking wall, like, a lot of politicians in Mexico say it... Like the things is working right because right now after all the sacrifice, well Yair "The Panther" Rodriguez is the main event of the UFC Fight Night... And so for us it's great. Hi ya doing man? Can I get a picture? Thanks man! Thanks man! Whoo! Feel more pride for Mexico, I mean I know that he's living out here in the United States just like we all do so it just kind of feel more of like me, like you know I'm immigrated from Mexico, so uh it's been a... A big inspiration for a lot of people to like, ya know, come and uhh... And be somebody here in a different country. I mean you know I hate the fact that "Make America Great Again" I mean, I feel America is already great so... McGregor, he's coming for you if you're still there! This is a pretty big deal, right here, my man bring this... I mean this is great, this what make me get excited, you know all pumped up for Saturday... So this guy right here is a doing a great job. Yeah so I was saying that I was thinking last time, I was in the shower thinking about this stuff after a CNN interview of Donald Trump and stuff. I just think he's ignorant about some stuff, that he's supposed to know to be in his place where he's at right now, you know? I think he's just there because of his money. How many people has been here for years, they have been trying to do the right things, the right stuff but they have fucking years trying to becoming residents or have a green card and stuff, and then they can't. Sometimes you guys can say that because your living here and you don't watch or you don't see stuff that we always see... We just want to run sometimes, we just want to be in a better place you know? I mean I'm sorry, I'm sorry you can blame me if you want man, trying to be in the best place, you know but it... Your trying to do well in life, some of the ways, the easiest way is to just try to come here to the United States and do well. It's just about racism, it's about all that stuff, I mean this world doesn't progress. You know we have to broke, those, how do you call that stuff? Walls, we have to broke that walls, you know... It's just hard to live in a country where it's like a lot of corruptcy and stuff like that, you never know what can happen to you, it's just the way that I think. Right, and then last question on the topic, do you think America is a racist country still? In certain ways yes, and another different way to talk, no. It's just a kind of racism, it's a kind like funny, you know they try to play jokes and stuff like that, it's still racism It feel like shit guys, don't do it, please stop it. UFC Fight Pass is your ticket to more than one thousand live bouts, check out live events from over a dozen fight organizations. First fighter to the scale Alex "Bruce Leeroy" Caceres. 145 for Alex Caceres. And his opponent, Chihuahua, Mexico's Yair "The Panther" Rodriguez! 146 the official weight for Yair Rodriguez. Yair Rodriguez, again your first UFC main event, a lot of support for you here in the building, gotta feel pretty good? I'm pretty excited to be the headliner of the event right now. And thank you to all of my friends and people, family... All of you guys, thank you for come here. This is for you guys, I love you. I love you so much. All my cousins, my aunts my mom is right over there... All of my friends. I love you so much, thank you so much for this opportunity. Thank you. We look forward to watching you perform... Folks, Yair Rodriguez! Alex Caceres looks pretty relaxed, calm, I like that you know, actually I think I'm more nervous than him but who cares, who cares. Let's do the work, let's see how the fight goes and I'm pretty happy, pretty happy because all my family, all my friends and let's see what happens. Oh! There's more people there waiting for me. It's not pressure, this is an opportunity He has an unbelievable opportunity. How many guys in the UFC right now have that opportunity to lead a nation? You know... And we see what McGregor did with it and I hate to say it but Mexico is a little bit bigger nation. Than Ireland ya know so... How many times did Muhammed Ali lose throughout his career? I mean he lost you know, four, five, six times... But it's what he represented and and he can inspire everyone you know? Like you said with the political times he... Not only the hispanic community in Mexico, but in America, the Mexican Americans. I think Yair is the perfect guy to to kind of bring the traditional boxers over to the new world of MMA because he represents a lot of the traditional values they like but... he's an exciting fighter, he's a lot of fun to watch and... I think those tools is what really gives the kind of traditional boxing guys that bridge over into MMA. It's been an exciting journey I think for Yair. He's always been creative, he's always been passionate, he's always had a great work ethic but just to see him ya know, start to come into his own, start to turn this corner, put kind of all the techniques together, it's been a lot of fun, it's been an incredible journey. Time. It's like I told him before you know... You didn't get ready for three weeks or six weeks or eight weeks, no... You've been getting ready all your life since you were five years old, for today. You know so, whatever it is, he's ready, you know... He needs to put all of his martial arts skills out there and put them and show them to the world what he can do. All right with that it is now time for tonight's main event. Featherweight hopefuls Alex Caceres and Yair Rodriguez, deservedly find themselves in their first UFC main event. "El Corrido De Chihuahua" Well in terms of prospects across all UFC divisions they just don't come more highly touted then this young man twenty three year old Yair Rodriguez. Grew up surrounded by violence... And enjoys every moment of this. Everything in his life is about becoming a UFC champion, becoming a star. And man has his fan base swelled over the last twelve months. I mean everywhere we've gone here in Salt Lake City, your seeing Mexican flags, his name on vehicles, they're filming a documentary, this man is all of the rage in Mexico right now as he arrives at this UFC headliner. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the main event of the evening! Ready? You ready? Let's do it! Ahh! ‐Nice superman punch landed there by Caceres. Beautiful attack to the body by Rodriguez ‐This is where Caceres, oh! There he lands the nice left hand. Was just about to say he's gotta let those hands go and he lands nicely... Best punch of the fight for him. Rodriguez has landed more, oh! Twice as many significant strikes. American crowd here getting behind Caceres. ‐Right to the body, left to the head. Fifth and final round. Alex Caceres had to feel like if he got to this point he'd be in a pretty good position. ‐Really this round could decide the fight. ‐I'll tell ya, Rodriguez, he's pushing the pace here. ‐Letting the hands go, another beautiful kick, his right leg is so fast there is no telegraphing. Nice job by Caceres to land that offering but unable to land on it's own... And Rodriguez... Looking to put the finishing touches on what has been a good fifth round for him. ‐Just nonstop and again lands it! Ladies and gentleman, after five rounds we go to the judges scorecard for a decision. Derrick Cleary scores the contest 49‐46 Caceres. Glenn Trowbridge scores it 48‐47 Rodriguez. And Tony Wheeks scores the contest 48‐47 for the winner by split decision... Yair "The Panther" Rodriguez! Yair Rodriguez congratulations!

My little kid Yair." "This is a culmination of the sportsman that he puts through and he just make me like, a lot, pretty happy." Are you glad the fight is over now? She said she's glad because "It was too long, five rounds you know twenty five minutes in there, three rounds five minutes It was to long for her because they were hitting each other to hard..." Perfect, so and we got fight of the night, did I hear that? Fight of the fucking night man... What are we doing to celebrate? X‐rays, X‐rays and pain pills. This is how it feels bro. They know, I mean... They know about my... My life before starting MMA, how I was, ya know I was a fucking crazy kid. They know you know. This sport has saved my life literally. You know they know I love this sport. I used to live with my aunt in Juarez and she know that I was having a hard time, she was helping me a lot there.. She was giving me money that I never pay her back for I don't know why I remember this. I never pay her back, she was just helping me a lot. My aunt Shelly, she was always talking to me about all of my dreams come true and stuff, supporting me and stuff like that. They just amazing bro. It's been a hard time for all of us you know, hard. I mean like I'm telling you I think Mexico has a lot of inspiration they just need a little bit of a push But this is not just for Mexico, I mean I have a lot of friends here and I just want to broke that walls. Go past through that walls you know, like it doesn't exist. I mean, we can live like brothers... We're, you know we are just a fucking couple minutes from the border right now... And... Where people's try to jump and all that kind of stuff, where they are trying to come to the United States... You will see that kind of stuff. Have you ever had any friends or family, that you know of, that have tried to cross and not gotten through or gotten through? Umm... I don't think that I should say that bro, I don't know... Be careful with the fucking electricity. The only thing that make us different, because the government make us different is that kind of stuff, you know? That's what pull us apart, that's the only thing. They call it like the "Golden Jail" being here in the United States without papers... Because yea, I mean let's say you get work but you are by yourself here alone. All right you have money, but you came here because you want to help your family and now you can't see your family. Now you are just sending them money. You can not see them, you can not do stuff, you can not travel to much because because you literally live in fear of the police come and get you. Or you are working at a restaurant or something like that and they go and get you there. People's is gonna still coming it doesn't matter if Donald Trump puts a wall right here... They still gonna be doing tunnels or flying all over so... It doesn't matter, people just gonna keep looking for a best chance of living. Hi sir, we are just gonna ask for permission to film the little piece of metal like where it says Mexico and the United States. Sometimes people doesn't understand, it's not there job to understand... I've been, for months I've been under the land of cameras, you know signing autograph for hours... But I mean you owe that to the people, you know you can't say no or you can't mad or stuff like that because these people done love you and it's people you love too, so, you know there's nothing you can do about that. So where are we now? This is a pretty sweet view. Um, we are getting into the piece of land I was talking to you guys about that I just buy where' I'm gonna build a house. I mean it's just... Like right in front. It's a good piece of land, I think we can build a beautiful house here. Does that ease some of the pressure knowing that your gonna be able to have the finances to help your whole family out? K, I'm gonna say this but not on camera. I mean my career's been good until now but I have to figure some stuff out you know. I'm going to try to renegotiate my contract... And I have five fights, I win five of those fights and Every time they ask for something I say yes, you know, I've been... I'm a clean guy, I'm a professional athlete. Every time that I'm gonna fight... I speak English, I speak Spanish you know so I think that I deserve a little bit more money you know, so... Even if it's hard for me, even if I love this sport, if things are not going the way that I want, want it to go... I'm gonna stop fighting you know because I think it's the way that it has to be you know? Look at my body, you know I'm limping and I'm twenty three years old. What's gonna happen you know, later? Of a 100 percent of my purse, I have to pay 52 percent... 48 percent is mine. So... What the fuck... ya know? I know that I have to pay that money because my coaches, my manager, federal taxes are... You know the United States taxes because of being Mexican in there you have to pay 30 percent of taxes and stuff like that... But I just want you guys to know that it's not like you guys think, I don't have tons of money in my bank account. Being Mexican do they charge you a higher tax than a normal American? Yeah, being Mexican they charge you a higher taxé\ than being a normal American citizen. Hopefully the UFC help me out with a little bit more motivation that way I can keep fighting. But you wouldn't be afraid to walk away? I won't be afraid... I have... I don't want to be rough with the people, but I have, you know, Mexican Pride... So, if I have to say to my dream goodbye for sometime I will say goodbye. I mean it is about life too, I think... I just have one body, ya know... Ya know, that's why it's to hard I don't want to be fixing my body with the money that I have in the bank account... Just because I don't take care of that when I'm supposed to take care of that.
