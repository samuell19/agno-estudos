Amen. if she is given the heart and the eyes of young virgins until the day the Prince of Darkness plants in her womb the seeds of his immortality. May I remind you the new owners of the castle will arrive tomorrow. I'll stay here. Raquel is dead, Father. It's the hand of the devil. Christa, Raquel is dead. I know, a demon took her heart. - Nonsense. - What else then? I don't believe in demons. It must have been a maniac, someone who gets his pleasure from blood. Raquel has been murdered. Oh, no, let's go and see. Viveca doesn't believe in vampires, only in bloodthirsty maniacs. And you? Yes, you. Laureen's stepfather has bought the castle. They say it's cursed. - Bring us all the way up to the castle. - No, it's cursed. I'd like to introduce myself, since we're both living here. My nephew shouldn't have sold his part of the castle. Nobody will come here to bother you. - I don't want to hear that piano. - I've bought it. My stepdaughter, Laureen, is celebrating her engagement to Richard Brenton. You must know him. He's a local. I won't have anything to do with anybody. You play divinely, but I'm jealous of your attention. Hello, congratulations. The sound of the piano is enchanting. Play on, Lenda. - Richard gave me this. - It's beautiful, darling. Doesn't she play divinely? Let's toast to her and to you. I'll get you a magnificent wedding present. Wait and see. You're in a strange mood tonight, William. Sorry, I'm not used to electric light. I'll go outside and get some air. You're transcendent and volatile. Here, have one of these. No, thank you. William's going outside. I'll try to seduce him. I would die for such a mysterious man. Go back inside. Jack Nelson. I know you. Go back inside. Quickly. I had no intention of dancing. Should I be happy or frightened in this castle? It's a castle like any other. Help me. I was attacked. Somebody attacked me. - She slipped. - No, I was attacked. It was a horrible monster. Something jumped at me from behind. I felt a terrible force. I was scared to death. It had green hair, like all monsters. And its eyes were like fire. I jumped to free myself. I didn't slip, I swear it. He held my mouth shut with an awful, big, hairy hand. It was disgusting. You have a rich imagination. Why do you want to ruin my party? It's true, I swear. I didn't slip. A terrible monster attacked me. I can't tell you how horrible it was. Viveca, why don't you tell them it's true? Help me. It's hard, it's very hard to die. We wish you great joy and happiness. Gros, why don't you say something? You're so handsome. - At least you'll believe me. - Get lost. Tomorrow you'll tell us another story about the cursed castle. Burn the witch. Kill her. It's only a story. Don't kill her. Don't let them kill me, jack. I don't want to die. Let me go. I'm not a witch. Help me, jack. I don't want to die. Murderers. Isabella, Great Mistress, we bring you back to life until the great ritual of the 25th moon. Thank you for your tears. I consider them your blessing for our engagement. You will live again, Isabella. You will live again, I swear. A lover can only be brought back to life if she's given the heart and the eyes of young virgins. Until the day the Prince of Darkness plants in her womb the seed of his immortality. Isabella, why? Burn her. Murderess. - Stephy, don't do this. - What? Voilá, the divine innocent. I've got a nicer one. It's transparent. It tells the future and reads our minds. I love you, Richard. You're perfect fools if you don't see how I'm turning and flying like a bird. It's very hard. Just imagine that someone is attacking you from behind. Where are we? We're not in the castle. Where are we? Why did the gate close? No, have mercy. Stop it. Help. I swear it's for real. Help. Christa is dead. Come quickly. She's really dead, everyone. Come quickly. Father, give her your blessing. Her body belongs to Satan. She's damned for all eternity. Impale her, only then can she find eternal rest. Superstitious nonsense. - It's just a dead girl. - Dead? And those wounds on her neck? That's what vampires do. They're dead frightening. Let's go to the cemetery. - Me too? - Yes, you. Idiot. Father, listen to me. I heard a noise. It's just your imagination. Let me out. Help. No, go away. Vampires need blood that's not contaminated by human semen. The mystery involves eternal life, reincarnation and... I was ferreting about in your books. Without my permission? Mr.jack Nelson asked my permission. It is forbidden? - What if it is? - It's ridiculous. The bit I read was just superstitious nonsense. Don't you believe in vampires, Richard? No. Only in psychopaths who find sexual fulfilment at the sight of blood. There's nothing supernatural about it. It's simply a phenomenon of Sadism which ignorance and superstition transform into vampirism, witchcraft and demons. The people thought Isabella was a witch and burned her alive. Why, if she was innocent? That happened 500 years ago. - Am I right, Nelson? - Certainly. Today I talked with some farmers. It happened five centuries ago. And telling the story still gives them the shivers. Why? Because we all played a part in it, at the time. Or still do. It's all in the chronicles of that time. No horror story, simply the facts. Have a look for yourself, Richard. “In the village of Arie, the inquisition started a ruthless witch hunt. Isabella Drupel, a vampire and a witch, was arrested in her bed, where she lay with her lover.” That's her. She's the witch. What do you want from me? You come with us. You idiots. Count Dracula, her heartbroken lover, vowed revenge. He invoked the powers of darkness and became the first vampire. In return for his vow, he had to live off blood. And I, a human being, am in love with a creature, that was murdered by the ignorance of human beings. Or by their truth. By their terrible truth. So in love that he wanted to bring her back to life by sacred rites? Why was Isabella burned alive if it wasn't true? Why? Help, let me out. I'll go mad in here. Richard, help me. Viveca, Laureen is gone. She's disappeared, but I heard her scream. Richard. Help me. Where is she? Stop it. She probably wanted to see the cellar. A sudden noise frightened her so much that it caused a traumatic shock. It's normal that she doesn't remember anything, because nothing happened. What about the blood, Dr. William? She must have been so seized by panic that she hurt herself. The corridor is narrow and the walls have sharp protrusions. Anyway, it's only a scratch. Where is Lenda? She was thinking of leaving the castle. I saw her leaving. She didn't say good-bye to me. Try to get some rest, Laureen. Exactly. Sometimes sleep is the best cure. Viveca, I can't sleep. Viveca, I can't sleep. Go bother Rochy, or William or whoever, but let me sleep. I'll keep myself company. To hell with you. You can drop dead, for all I care. Stephy, don't play tricks on me. Say something, Stephy. She's dead. You don't believe me, do you? But Christa is dead. What's that? Who's there? I heard something. What happened? Stephy is a fool. She feels neglected by everyone, including vampires. Her blood isn't tasty enough. I told her so. My eyelashes. Her eyelashes. Viveca, I liked Christa. I saw her by the window. It's Rochy's fault. He made you cry again. She's always rejected me, using the excuse that she's a virgin. I told her so. We all came into the world as virgins. I too was once a virgin. Move over so I can lay down beside you. She really did it. No, let go of me. Please, stop. Let me go. It's the night of the 25th moon. Your eyes will see the eternal light, Isabella, Great Mistress. The hour of the Sabbath for the young virgins has come. They who believe in eternal hell fire will sacrifice their blood to you. Great Mistress... you will choose the eyes in which the glow of desire illuminates all suffering. Through those eyes you'll see the light again for the glory of Satan. What's happening? What's this? What's happening? Father, have mercy on us. Free us from worldly sins. Defeat Satan. Only you can do it. The castle is becoming an obsession for me too. Let's leave. We will, darling. Who's there? Satan. Go away. Monster. Let me go. Mabel, I'm scared. Mabel, the cross is burning. The sky is clear. How come there's lightning? Those two are possessed by the devil. They set the cross on fire. It's them. They've set the cross on fire. They've set the cross on fire. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. They've set the cross on fire. They're not shouting at us, my pet. They're witches. Burn the witches. What's happening? - They're witches. - Kill them. What do they want? - I'm afraid. - Come. Why? - Burn them. - They must die. - Mabel, what do they want? - It's not true. - What are they doing? - What do they want? Kill them. It's not true. - You're possessed. - Witches. - Stop it. - They're possessed. They're vampires. They're a threat to our villages and women. I agree with you. They're possessed. I too have seen the signs on their bodies. But let's submit them to the final test. No demon can pass by the altar at the crossroads without being incinerated. That's what the chronicles say. Let them try to pass by the altar. Why are they doing this? - I'm not possessed. - I'm not a witch. You're mad. You're the demons. - Where are we? - They've all gone. Where are we? It's all gone. By dying for Satan, they will all live again in our light. She will be brought to life again on every night of the 25th moon. Great Mistress, Isabella. I want an explanation. Nothing is real anymore in this damned castle. I cannot help you, Richard. Yes, you can. But you prefer to keep up a curtain of mystery. I cannot help you, Richard. You know more about this. Girls in and outside the castle have vanished. I'm sure you have the key to finding them. I'll knock your teeth out if you don't tell me. It's a very fine line between the known and the unknown, Richard. I spent my life trying to understand it. Nobody knows for sure what is real. Maybe the things we see are just the things we want to see. On moonlit nights, I am always fearful. Why? Where is Laureen? - Stephy, where is Laureen? - Vanished. You are the chosen one. But only when your eyes shall reflect the glow of the infernal fire of desire. Then your eyes will live on forever... in Isabella. Monsters. Let me go Murderers. Quiet, you mandrill. Little witch. I've found my big vampire. I don't care about Laureen. Murderers. He isn't yours. He's mine. He's my vampire. Richard, that gate hasn't been opened for a thousand years. Miss Laureen cannot be there. The villagers can't find my daughter. She must be inside this castle. Help us find her. Where is jack Nelson? Why isn't he looking for your daughter? He has vanished too. Gerg, why did you let him pass? Why did you let him pass? He must look for her in the underworld. You'll walk in front of us to the snake pit. Go on, to the snake pit. Get going- Let me go. No, I don't want to. Let me go, monsters. Let me go. He's my vampire. The castle gave him to me and I won't let anybody take him away from me. Great Mistress Isabella, you will unite with Laureen when in her eyes the fire lights that will consume the ages. Then you will enter her and she will enter you, and her eyes will be yours for all eternity. Go on, Gerg. We're there. I've been looking for that coffin for centuries. Hurry, we've got to find Laureen. Her life depends on this coffin. Only a woman's will can open it. Laureen's will. Keep looking. Ignite in your eyes the infernal fire of desire. Look. Monster. I got lost in the cellar of the castle. That's all I remember. You got lost in time, Laureen. You mysteriously succeeded in bringing jack and me to life by reincarnation. You were Isabella, and Gerg was your servant. And you were me. Nelson turned you into a vampire in your previous life. Because of him you were burned at the stake. Kill him. When you called him a monster, you erased from your memory the horrible rite he forced you to endure. You drive me mad. Not today. I did drive you mad, more than four centuries ago. Don't try to understand it. I told you tonight, it's a fine line between the known and the unknown. I've been reincarnated, Richard. And as a consequence of some terrible curse, I'm aware of it. Your science doesn't provide an explanation of my case or his. Kill him. Only the woman he adored can kill his eternal hate, in the name of love. Laureen, kill him before it's too late. Kill him, Laureen. - I love you. - Look at her, that mad girl. A nice castle here. I never seem to land on my feet.
