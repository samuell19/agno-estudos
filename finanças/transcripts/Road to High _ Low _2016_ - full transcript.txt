Our enemy is Iemurakai. - What? - When we were here, then they will destroy SWORD. Hey! Noboru! From now on, Iemurakai controls SWORD! You must all submit to us! Noboru! If you refuse, Whoever I am, I'll shoot! We, Squadron Sannoh Hoodlum, will disband. I just wish the three of us could be friends again. Do you understand? Now put the gun down! Come on, Noboru! Stay away! Stay away! I told you guys to get out! Noboru! A legendary gang once dominated this place. MUGEN VEHICLE DRIVER LEADERS Kohaku TSUKUMO COBRA YAMATO However, there were a couple of brothers who were not afraid of Mugen. They were Mugen's only formidable opponents. LEGEND AMAMIYA AMAMIYA MASAKI AMAMIYA HIROTO But when the conflicts are still tense, Mugen was suddenly disbanded. Amamiya Brothers also disappeared. SANNOH TEMPERATURE HOODLUM Then there were five gangs that emerged. This area is called SWORD. DARUMA ASSOCIATION The five gangs are known as G-SWORD. These five gangs go head-to-head, Mutual control at SWORD. We have been best friends since we were children. What do you want to do at home? After school that day, Yamato and I talked to Noboru for the first time. What are you doing here alone? I don't want to go home, my house doesn't have anyone. Come in. No one at home? My mom is playing pachinko . My parents always work until night. Are you guys alone too? Let's have dinner, then play video games. Hurry up, Noboru! Come with us! You get 100 points? Great! Do you want to be a professor or win a Nobel Prize? No, I don't like those things. What do you want to do? I want to protect the people. Protecting the people? Like the police? Are not. Lawyer. I don't know what it is, but it sounds great! Don't you know? I don't know, but that sounds great! How is school? Not bad. Being a lawyer is very hard. But it was worth it. In this world, there are not only strong people. There are also many people who are treated unfairly. That's right. I want to be able to help those people. You are wonderful. At that time, Yamato and I belonged to the Mugen gang, led by Kohaku. We did all kinds of stupid things. Unlike us, Noboru has a future he longs for. He is our pride. But then… THE POLICE DOES NOT ENTRY After Mugen disbanded, we reunited as a group, including people who only know how to fight And people began to call us Squad Sannoh Hoodlum. When you have a reputation, other gangs will also hunt you down. Like fate. We continue to survive with our fists. But… We don't know what the real pain is. We are still kids. Chữ "S" trong SWORD Sannoh Hoodlum Squadron, formed by two former Mugen members Cobra and Yamato. SANNOH TEMPERATURE HOODLUM SANNOH TEAM TETTSU HOODLUM DAN TEAM SANNOH HOODLUM CHIHARU TEAM SANNOH HOODLUM Noboru? Hey, Noboru ... What do you think about us? What we do is not wrong. I want to believe that. Where's Noboru? When has he been released from prison? SWORD included five gangs with five adjacent areas. This balance of power can crash for the smallest reasons. Chiharu just transferred to Oya Middle School and ran into these guys. You don't do that here. It was Yamato who saved him. I want Yamato to join us. Chiharu left home, So there's nowhere left to go. But… Hey, Yamato. What are you doing? What if Oya School knows what? They will use excuses to be aggressive. This is none of Sannoh Hoodlum's business. This is your problem. I can't let my brothers bleed unreasonably. It was him. Sure. Heard you had an encounter with my men. That Chiharu is here right now? If so, what? That's right, Chiharu is with me. Then hand him over here. I won't pay Chiharu back to you. So Sannoh Hoodlum Squadron went to war with Oya Middle School. Is that what you mean? Those Oya High School bastards are planning to fight us. Their leader, Murayama ... He was the first to unify the Oya High School band. The "O" in SWORD is Oya Middle School. OYA HIGH SCHOOL Oya Middle School has two groups, full-time and part-time students. Part-time students are over 20 years old. To find the best warriors among them, they organize life-and-death battles every day, in other words, like fighting clubs. FURUYA HIDETO SEKI KOTARO OYA MURAYAMA YOSHIKI SECONDARY SCHOOL OYA HIGH SCHOOL I will not lose to you like this! Come here! Finish me off! About Chiharu ... He has nowhere to go. Simply ... I want to help him. It seems he is treating Chiharu as if he were Noboru. But Chiharu ignored Yamato's wishes. I will handle this with Oya tapes. Yamato. Chiharu went to solve the problem with the Oya High School crew. Cobra! OYA HIGH SCHOOL Furuya, please fight me alone! Chiharu! Stay away! Back! I really understand longing protect Yamato's Chiharu. However, if we encroach on their property, The balance at SWORD will collapse. But I do not want… lost one more friend. Yamato! You are here. I have had enough! Hands off! Shut up, you bastard! Cobra is here! Is this the raid? Who are you? Come here. You and me duel. Okay. Hey, why is that? Why can't I stand up this time? Heady! Stop! Let them go! Sorry, Seki. Murayama ... Maybe we still haven't graduated yet. The guys at Oya Middle School ... They will get stronger. OVERCOKE ALCOHOL ODAKE That's hurt! The inside of my mouth is torn. You! I caused trouble. And I won't join Sannoh. - I will be absent from Oya school and ... - Don't be stupid! So what is today? Do whatever you want. You did what you should do. Shallow cup! It's about to start. Thanks to the shopkeeper. I do n't think people respect Mr. Inoki enough. Dude, where did the battle come from? From here. Do you have a fighting spirit? Have. "Inoki Bom-ba-ye" hay "Inoki Ganbare?" Which one is this? "Ganbare". Say, "Ready?" Ready? Again. Ready? Let me tell you about my love for Mr. Inoki. Get back the spirit. Do it again. - Ready? - You passed! Great! Beans are too easy! - Hello. - Hello. After solving the problem with the Oya High School crew, it seems that the balance at SWORD is preserved. But then, another event pushed the conflict high. I am a unique person. What the hell are you doing? Stop it. I never hit a woman. It's this person's fault. And? So he is Dan? Is Naomi okay? Who does this? Who do that? Shut up! White Rascals? Why are they here? And! I just go to their club. But I don't know which is their area. How many clubs do you go to Rascals? A strange girl invites me. Are you free now? I have a favor to ask. It is not difficult. It was a small metal box. What's inside? SD memory card. She asked me to give it to someone. Oh my God! Are you OK? Hey! Hey! Chữ "W" trong SWORD being a scout gang, they protect women who are abused by men, White Rascals. CRAZY ROCKY Don't harm any women anymore. Stop it! He said to me, "Pay back what you stole." I didn't steal anything. I was only asked to transfer help. They are wrong! The black markets took advantage of him. It is like that. What about the thief? Area scramble is very common. It happened quite clearly. Long time no see. Noboru? Boy… From now on, I'm a member of Iemurakai. Iemurakai? You mean the Kowloon Hoi? Iemurakai is one of the nine "dragons" of the Kowloon Assembly. People who are capable of inheriting the Kowloon Hoi are trying to exert financial influence to increase their power. IEMURA TATSUMI ÔNG CHỦ, IEMURA KAI ISHII KAWADA NIKAIDO KIRINJI They have planned redevelopment of the SWORD region. Then they will make a profit from it. The five gangs at SWORD were a factor in hindering this plan, they intend to capture or destroy. Should we leave this to the youngsters to take care of? I believe Noboru is suitable for this mission. No way. Why are you sticking to them, Noboru? From now on, Iemurakai, a member of the Kowloon Hoi, will control the SWORD region. If they oppose, they will be suppressed. If you don't want that, Please join me. That is the only way for you to survive. That's all. Don't be as cold as a machine. You guys have one night. Think carefully. What do we do, Cobra? Haven't you opened it yet? - I'll open it now. - Damned! - You guys are so worried. - Really? My heart is beating so fast! - Okay, here I go. - OK! You can do it, Noboru! - Open it. - Do it! Fighting! Open it! You failed! - Dammit! - Oh! - You did it, brother! - Idiot, I passed it! You passed! Congratulations! That's hurt! You did it, Noboru! Thanks! Great! Damned! But it's not over yet. Going to college doesn't mean I can become a lawyer. Only when I pass the law exam, will that be the beginning. Cobra, slap me for good luck. Sure! OK. Get ready. Noboru, focus on! OK. - OK! - OK. Do it! OK. Start! That's hurt! Cobra is very proud to have a friend like him. What? He's as happy as if he passed it himself. Oh come on. Me too. Have a friend like you makes me very proud. Noboru. We support you. Follow me. - I swear to become a lawyer. - OK! HINO GAS STATION How do you guys decide? How the hell ... Are you a member of Iemurakai again? If you were me, what would you do? - Arrive. - Thanks. Thanks, Yamato. This is an important test. Hurry up. Yes. Paper and pen over there. Thanks. Okay, let's get started. Let's go to the bay. Long time no go there. Great! Good idea! That's right! But that day ... It's okay. You go. Hey, Miho. Are you free? Join a party with my study group. Right? Yeah, let's go! Begin! No! Sorry. I'm going. Your photo is very beautiful. Really? Miho already has a boyfriend? Miho! I know you are in there! Miho… Who are you? Hey! Wait! The future I have longed for has gone into smoke. When I was in prison, Nikaido talked to me. If you want, I'll give you one last chance. However, You need to prepare to give up the past. The scum that harmed Miho is living out there. I'm the only one to be convicted. And that is not the only unfair punishment. My father ... boycotted by society, this broke my family. This world is terrible. I just want this world destroyed. Yes? Have you decided yet? With us, you can start your life again. Noboru ... Come back to us. You still don't understand? I'll give you one more chance. If you don't want to join, disband Sannoh Hoodlum Squad. What can we do to save Noboru? When we were looking for the answer, Another conflict occurred. Chiharu ... It was a small metal box. What's inside? SD memory card. She asked me to give it to someone. Oh my God! Are you OK? This SD memory card. Hey! Damned. Chiharu. I have to do something. WHITE RASCALS I need to see Rocky. Yamato from the Sannoh Hoodlum Squadron. You found it. What's on that card? We are just providing a place for customers to do business safely. We do not interfere with their agreement. Don't joke with me. I also have a bunch of questions. This girl is Smoky's sister. Belonging to the Rude Boys? Why was one of his crew involved in Rude's business? I can only say that Sannoh is not involved in this. Someone is manipulating us. Do you think I'll believe that nonsense? I said it wasn't us! Don't drag Sannoh in. Whatever. At least found this one. Are you kidding? I can't understand your thoughts. And you will never understand. Found her. That moment, to solve the problem with White Rascals and prove his innocence, Dan traces the source of all the problems, Smoky's sister, who belongs to the Rude Boys gang. Don't tell me they are ... This place is Nameless City. Those who have been abandoned by their parents, or those who want to hide, or those who carry dark secrets will gather in this illegal city, City of Unknown. This city has a guardian angel. Chữ "R" trong SWORD, Rude Boys. LEADERS SMOKY TAKESHI SHION P And… ITO KAN RESTAURANT CLOSED What happened? You won't believe it. It is the new stimulant called "Redrum". Just started appearing in SWORD. The Lala girl, who caused me trouble in Heaven, I followed her. Then I found myself lost in a small building in Unknown City. That's where they do Redrum. More, Who do you think I saw? That bastard. Chiharu. How can that be? It felt like he was completely one of them. Hey Yamato. How much do you know? He didn't say anything about himself. I suspect the story won't be what I want. I'm going home. Chiharu ... betrayed us? With Yamato ... Chiharu is like Noboru. So I can understand why he wants to trust Chiharu. So what? The Oya High School Pirates and the White Rascals both ignore us. And Daruma and Sannoh are in talks. I know. This is too difficult for him. So Kirinji, What are you going to do? I will let Daruma's Hyuga go to jail. Inciting that bastard to go to war, and SWORD will shatter. Then they will submit to us. Where not. What? An all-out war will just provoke G-SWORD, and I will never get under control. Give me a little more time. Noboru. You are a member of the family. I really hope that. Thanks. However, Family, betrayer or failure will not be forgiven. Remember. PARKING HOUSE ASAHINA Hey, do you want lunch? Rice ball again? - Well then. - Can I eat it? You know, that cute Chiharu from before ... What's wrong with him after that? Who knows? You know, you're stupid, so thinking doesn't help. - What? - The good of fools that they act without worrying about the consequences. Delicious. See you later. You have a new message. Noboru. I'll wait for you in the old place. Hi Yamato. Long time no see. I'm looking for someone. The name is Chiharu. - Never heard of. - We here treat each other like family. If there is an insider, I will know immediately. What about Redrum? "Redrum?" The stimulants you do here and there. No matter what, we never touch drugs. I got it. You're slandering us so you can go to war, right? What? Yamato! Damned! Smoky! Do not worry about me. Let's go after those guys. Chase them! Looks like Redrum has appeared in our territory. All gangs in SWORD banned drugs. Rocky, information in the SD memory card is a list of customers who buy Redrum. Are the bastards of Rude trying to sell Redrum? Thoroughly clean them. They are gone. Almost died. Let's go home. Are not. Take me to the Redrum factory. Impossible. They are still hunting for us. I need to meet Chiharu and talk to him. This place brings back memories, right? Do you remember that time? Great! Great! I said it! This is our city! - When you first saw the city from here ... - This city is disgusting. Did you call me just to talk about it? What is your final decision? We will not disband also did not join Iemurakai. Noboru. Leave Iemurakai now. It has nothing to do with you. It's not too late. I told you not to interfere! You only solve the problem with your fists, what do you know? I have washed away the past. We… not friends anymore We'll be together! Sure! Chiharu. What's happening? Say. Really… My dad was under a debt collection. Every day they came to collect money from him. Father… That is when… Leave him alone. This is a family member of my friend. If you want, you can help your father. The condition Noboru suggested was to work in the Redrum factory and reporting on the actions of Squadron Sannoh Hoodlum. That is the only way for my father to be saved. At that time I was sent to the factory. This plant is operated by Iemurakai Rude's Shion keeps this a secret from Smoky. Take care of everything. Leave it to me. But Shion started selling the medicine without telling Iemurakai. He kept the money to himself. Noboru let me work in this factory to keep an eye on Shion. COPYING ... And everything you say is true? Yes. Shion was definitely exchanging a deal in Heaven. You should sneak, then do what I say. Oh my God! Are you OK? What about the noise I got into? It's just a coincidence. Lala doesn't know anything. She was used by Shion. The fact that I stole my SD card and caused a riot at the Rascals club, all are conspiracies. The mess at that club ... will cause Rascals and Rude to fight. That was Noboru's plan. What the hell… Just because of this ... that we have been toyed with! Damned! Hey! Do you know what would happen if you did that in our area! The factory is in trouble. Hello. Noboru. You also go. Smoky. I'm okay. What the hell is this? You bastards. What the hell is this? Hey, Smoky. Prepare to die. We almost know everything. What is Shion's name? Shion? It was he that bastard selling Redrum. Hey, Shion. Please explain. I will deal internally with Shion. What? I won't let you touch anyone who lives here. I have enough! Enough! What they want is we fight. They make a noise in the nightclub to provoke Rascals and Rude to fight. That's what Iemurakai wants! So we must not be intrigued! In other words, did Iemurakai put all this up? How dare they do this dirty trick in my area? How can I bring Noboru back to us? Iemurakai wants to control SWORD. They won't forgive Sannoh. Vì Noboru… and brothers in the group ... I cannot lose. You guys have destroyed this place. Noboru! I guess you're ready for the consequences. Do you know what you did? Shut up. That is the question for you guys. These guys are really ... Do you really want to fight us? Noboru. What's happening? Why are you on their side? Why would you do that? Noboru. Who ordered you to go there? It's you, Nikaido. I never ordered like that! Get back here now. Yes. Noboru! Don't forget what you guys did. Come on. Withdrawal. Why are you using those little brats? What a disappointment! Mr. Nikaido ... I'm sorry… Because of you, SWORD not only did not disband, that our factory was destroyed. I ... What am I doing? Everyone in Unknown City had no other relatives. So we consider each other as one family. But he put his family in danger. Lungs, liver, pancreas, kidneys, and heart. All must be left here. That is the rule of this city. - Smoky, I just ... - If you can't do it, Get out of here right now. What? I know you care about my health. You're trying to make money so that I can get treatment, aren't you? However, he takes money from Iemurakai. Leaving Unknown City ... is the safest thing for you. You did it for me. I'm so grateful. Smoky… Hey! Are you OK? Hey! - Hey! - Why refuse Iemurakai's offer? He used to ... Climb to the top thanks to her fists. But now, he's selling drugs. So you are not interested in Iemurakai? There Amamiya Brothers! It's Masaki! Why did he come back here? Hey, Hiroto? - Hey! - I'm in Sannoh City now. Hey! Wait. That was Hiroto of Brother Amamiya. Kohaku. What are you going to do? Unsuccessful rescue of Noboru, another problem emerged. The most dangerous gang in SWORD begins to take action. Gangs sponsor festivals in SWORD.

Really, I'll pull him back. What do we need to do for him? War declaration! Why do you two look so sad? The wounds from the battle will fade away. But… the bond of friendship will never be cut.
