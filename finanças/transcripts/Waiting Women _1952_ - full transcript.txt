DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2016 WAITING WOMEN Åke. Åke. Peter. Åke. Jens. Where could they be? They might be down there. - Åke! - Peter! Jens! - Yes! - Where are you? - Here! - Where? - Here. - Is Åke with you? - Yes. - Come out, immediately. Dear children, I've told you a million times to stay close. We might have thought you drowned. After you get the children to bed we'll have some coffee. Yes, it's time for bed. It's already 8:15. I don't think you need to wash up tonight. If you hurry up, you'll each get a piece of chocolate. Look what I caught. Oh, goodness. Don't you feel sorry for the poor thing? Try it yourself, and you'll see how good it is. Yes, Eugen tried to teach me once. It resulted in him getting the hook in his ear. I'm planning on wearing a dress tonight. Yes, me too, but not until later. You can't be serious. Are you really going to change just because your boring husbands are coming home tonight? Hey, little sister. You're only 17, and you don't understand. Look at me. I'm not at all anxious about seeing Henrik for the first time in a month. When do you think they'll be here? Did Fredrik mention on the phone when they thought they'd be here? The train from Copenhagen arrives at 8:00, and then they were going to eat. They're taking Eugen's car so they could be here around 11:00. Yes, we're sitting around waiting on our men, and we're all nervous because we haven't seen them for weeks. And then we're all going to be here on vacation for a few days. All of us together. Without privacy for our personal sorrows and problems. It won't be a vacation for me. Dear Annette, we had the impression that you and Paul had a good relationship. Of course we do. We say "Good day," "Good-bye," "Good morning, darling" and "Good night, sweetie." "How's your day been?" "Tonight it's Bergman's." "We're going to the Pyrenees this year." "I'm buying a camera." But we're never close to each other. There's never any intimacy or contact. Sometimes I almost wish he would beat me. Can't you speak with him? It wouldn't work. He'd only get embarrassed. - Cheat on him. - Hush, child. You've read too many tabloids. I can't yell at him. I can't tie his body to mine. I can't tear out his eyes so that he'll become blind and dependent on me. I can't even take him in my arms and rock him to sleep when I see that he's upset and has problems. You think I'm silly, don't you? A grown woman like me should have given up and found her way. I could have sought comfort with Jesus or the grandchildren. I might become a grandmother, right, Maj? You'll have ten grandchildren. I promise. Just wait until Henrik turns 23, and then we'll start. Yet, it doesn't satisfy me. I have my life. My only life. And that's my life with Paul. I'm sure we loved each other as eagerly as Maj and Henrik do now. But what have we become? Two bowing Chinese. No, I refuse. It can't be meant to be that way. We'll have to try to comfort each other. You're not as unique in your loneliness as you think. I know what it's like to be lonely. We shouldn't talk about it. Women should talk to each other more openly and more often. We should share our experiences and comfort each other. We shouldn't be affected by men's silly need for prestige and secrecy. I remember the day Eugen and I were forced to wake up and face our situation. It was both ridiculous and appalling. - But that's nothing to talk about. - Why not? We can learn something about each other and thereby make it easier living together during our vacation and maybe afterwards as well. Well, if you want to. It was two years ago. Eugen and I were alone out here that summer. Eugen was writing his history thesis, and I took care of the house and did nothing. - Kaj? - Good day, little Rakel. - How did you get here? - The herring boat. - Where's your wife? - She won't make it. She didn't feel well. Yes, you're having a baby. - And you? - Me? - The last time I saw you, you said... - Nothing came of it. I'm sorry. Eugen has gone to town. I saw him. He ran down the hill, waving his hat to stop the boat. I feel sorry for those always in a hurry. - Is he very busy, your husband? - Somewhat. Is he helping Fredrik with the family business? He's writing his thesis. Antiquity studies. Colossally interesting. Eugen has always been interested in antiques, old furniture and such. - You share his interest? - Sure. How beautiful. When the thesis is finished, will he... - Then it's going to be printed. - Which publisher? - He's paying for it himself. - Meaning, big brother Fredrik. No, not at all. He's not getting a dime from Fredrik. How about that? What kind of money does Eugen have? I mean, in addition to what he gets from the company? That doesn't concern you. Does your loyalty toward Eugen forbid you to admit that you're providing him with the funding? It's nobody's business. Besides, Fredrik has been terrible towards Eugen. Fredrik believes that money should be used for beneficial purposes. Fredrik is a wise man. You're stupid. Don't look like you think I'm going to seduce you. Seduce? You? Me? I'd like to see that. You're not at all shameless. You're just like when we were kids. You're just as soft and indulgent. Just as pretty and fragrant. And just as flushed and irritated afterwards. I certainly don't know what I... You're not doing anything. There's no need. No, thanks, Kaj. That's good enough. You're probably talented and wonderful, but I'm very much in love with Eugen. The things you say, little Rakel. I can tell by your nose that you're lying. Stop playing around. I love Eugen. I really do love him. Get away. And you have a wife. You have pangs, Rakel. - I have pangs? - Yes, of morality. They're located in your stomach and can be operated on like your appendix. Have you told your husband we were in love when we were younger? Of course. What did he say? He thought it was adorable. No. It's madness. It's madness. Don't you understand? It can't be like this. You... You... Rakel has to decide for herself. Rakel doesn't get seduced. Rakel can't blame anything else. Why are you here? I don't know. You invited me. I don't want to hurt Eugen. I don't want to. He... We've grown together, you see. Six years is a long time. Do you want to eat lunch? Kaj, we have to know what we're doing. We have to take responsibility. We're not just dogs in heat. Now I absolutely think we should eat lunch. But a dip would hit the spot first. I brought my swim trunks with me. I'm so nervous I have a stomachache. It's your morals pinching. There's only one prescription. Operate. Rakel. Turn carefully, and you'll see something fun. I think it's creepy to swim with those really big fish. - What are you laughing at? - Nothing. At Freud. Maybe we should get in. Go ahead. A Spanish legend tells of a couple of lovers who longed for each other day and night. And it was arranged for them to meet. When they entered the love nest and saw each other, they had strokes and dropped dead. It's a dumb story. It's a moral story. May I ask how? It shows the danger of longing. Do you remember the time in our childhood when we laid here in the sun completely naked and compared each other's shape? We had locked ourselves in just in case. We were eight years old. You remember? And my dad knocked on the door and said we weren't allowed to be alone. He had a big hat. And that night there was a thunderstorm. The flagpole snapped in half and burned up. Some small insect has bitten me. Can you see a mark? It's difficult to scratch. I can neither see it nor reach it. It's a small sore, and it's bleeding. No. Let me be. I've only been unfaithful towards Eugen once before. It was completely wrong. It will always be completely wrong for me. Something is probably wrong with me. I don't know. Eugen becomes impatient and berates me and then tells me of other women he's brought immense pleasure to. I don't understand it. I don't even get warm. Do you think it's strange? No, not really. It was the same that time I was unfaithful. I'm probably completely hopeless. Even though I do everything Eugen wants, neither him nor I are happy. Mostly we become moody and depressed. So now I pretend to be happy, and then he's also happy. Finally you think the whole thing is disgusting. And that's not the way it should be. No. When you grabbed me up there in the room... and pressed your head against my stomach... it was so strange. You have to be nice to me. I'll be just like you want. - How about that? - Now it's my turn. - Watch this. - Let's see if you're as sure-handed. - So what happened there? - Yeah, that wasn't anything special. I can crown myself champion now. It's too dark. I think we'll have to quit. It's a pretty good rifle. It's a damn good rifle, but I think it fires a bit low. - Yeah, it appears that way. - Otherwise it shoots correctly. You might be able to adjust it. Well, how did it go? Who lost? I'm sad to admit it, but it was me. Kaj sure knows how to handle firearms. It's calmed down out there. It was almost... It was quite windy this morning. Where did you sail to? We just took a little trip. We were out to Rödhällen, reliving old memories. Yes, Rakel has mentioned it. We were 16 years old, weren't we? Eugen barely saw us because he was two years older and already dignified. I was doing my military service that summer. Did it look the same? What? Oh, Rödhällen. I think so. We didn't go ashore. Rakel didn't want to. It was so windy we could have damaged the boat. There's a harbor on the back side that's usually pretty calm. I didn't think of it. Rakel isn't usually afraid. No, but this time I was. You're a good sailor yourself? No, that's Rakel. So it's Rakel who sails your boat. She's something, isn't she? Cheers. What's the matter, dear? It is disgusting, disgusting, disgusting. How can you, Kaj? How can you? What kind of man are you? Me? A bastard like everyone else. Nothing. No, you're a coward. A terrible coward. Sure I am. A big coward. That's why I'm going to tell Eugen that we cheated on him today. Was that necessary? You think I enjoy sleeping with you, don't you? Because you're a nice, talented and considerate lover. But let me tell you something, Kaj. You disgust me. And you're not a good lover. Do you know why? You only love yourself. Only yourself and nobody else in the entire world. Only yourself. If I'm disgusting, so are you, my dear Rakel. You needed that little ecstasy that Eugen always denied you. And I gave it to you. And now you mock me afterwards. That's wonderful. You... You have cheated on me with him? You slept with him. You... You have... Yes, Eugen. I cheated on you. And I'm not asking for your forgiveness. You have destroyed my entire existence. You, the only person I ever trusted. You have deserted me for another. You maybe also told certain stories from our sex life. To save yourself and your morals. Is it my fault that you become stiff and... That's beside the point, Eugen. Beside the point? Oh, no. Don't try to weasel out of this one. Let me tell you something. Before I met you I was with other women, and I was considered a pretty good lover. And it's damn strange that just you... Well, whose fault do you think it is? The one thing I can't stand is to be exposed to others. I could tell stories as well, but I'm a gentleman. Yes, there's plenty to tell that I've tried to forget and forgive. I should probably have a talk with Kaj's poor wife. It's unnecessary for her to walk through life unaware, like I have. Then you and Kaj can move in together and devote yourself to your perfect love. Well, what do you say? You may take what you brought to the house and also what I've given you. Except for the old chest of drawers. It belongs in the family. I don't know what to say. You understand we can't live together any longer after what's happened. What do you want me to say, Eugen? I'll arrange for an apartment. You'll get money. A certain amount. Then you can furnish it however you want. I'll discuss those details with Fredrik tomorrow. I don't want any money. You may take what you brought to the house and also what I've given you. Except for the old chest of drawers. It belongs in the family. But I'll gladly pay for it. I'm also grateful that you told me the truth. I've always valued truth and honesty. I really have. The lawyer will arrange it. He will arrange... It will be better that way. But I want it accounted for. I mean, I want a list of furniture and household items... I said that already. What is it, Eugen? Can I help you? Nobody can help me. Nobody should help me. Can't you realize that we have to try and get through this together? Eugen, we have to try and forgive each other. I know that we can, if we want to, you and I. Think about it. Don't do anything you might regret. Don't do anything you'll regret, Eugen. You're one to talk. If I wanted, I could kill you. It would feel liberating. You're just a bastard. I don't know what's become of me, but I've probably gone mad. Why should I help you? What am I doing with you, Kaj or anybody else? I'm not your property that you can treat as you want. Eugen! - He's going to kill himself. - Like hell. - Yes, we have to get him. - Leave him be. He'll calm down. No, I'm going to look for him. - What is it? - He's in there. I tried to talk to him, but he said he'd shoot if I entered. I entered anyway, and he shot at the door. I have to talk to him. - No. You can't. - Let go. I can't see you. Go away. Go away! - I'm not leaving. - Watch yourself. You don't dare shoot. What should we do? What should we do? Just leave me alone! Leave me alone! We're never going to see each other again. You'll be rid of me. Do you hear? I'll never bother anybody again! I'll run and get Paul. He might be able to talk to him. - Wait here. - This is silly. Say nothing. Stay here. Paul. Annette. What is it? Is someone sick? No. You have to come and talk to Eugen. He's sitting in the boathouse with a rifle saying he'll kill himself. Hurry up. Annette, stay here. Rakel, come with me. You can go in, Rakel. Do so gently, and it might work out. Maybe. Come, you scoundrel. What did you say to the poor, suicidal guy? What I said? I said the worst is not to be deceived, but to be alone. If it's true or not... But it sounded good. You might think the story seems ridiculous. And it probably is. But we were all so tightly wound and melodramatic that night. Are things better now than before? Probably not for Eugen, but for me. How do you mean? I've come to realize that Eugen is my child, and it's my duty to take care of him. I feel sorry for him. He suffers greatly from what he calls his meaninglessness. Yet, he means everything to me now. So beautiful. Sentimental, maybe. I don't know. But Eugen is my meaning in life. And he says I'm the only thing keeping him alive. We support each other in that way. It's very simple. Peter says that angels have propellers. Quiet, sweethearts, and go to bed. Åke has to pee. You got Eugen in the end. Yes, and I'm pretty happy. But I'll never get Martin. Do you remember the first time we met? It was in Paris three years ago. Were you in love with Martin then? Since Rakel has been so brave to tell of her awakening, I'll have to show some courage and tell about mine. Just imagine how comforted Annette will feel. We thought you were sleeping. It was a hot summer morning. It was a Sunday. I lived in my parents' apartment. They'd gone out to the country for a week. I had it nice and alone. According to the doctor, I was in my eight month, but I had my suspicions. I was awakened by the contractions. Hello? Hello? Marta, are you there? Don't you want to answer? You can't treat me like I've committed a crime. I didn't know better. You have to talk to me. Don't toy with me. I don't believe your regret. You are the way you are, poor thing. I never want to marry you. Can I get a taxi at... There's no one available? Not in the entire town? But somewhere... SUCCESSFUL FAMILY COMPANY CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION WITH MEDALS AND BONUSES I had a terrible feeling that it was Death standing outside waiting for me. A solicitor or a family friend who didn't know everybody was out of town. There had to be an explanation. Yet I was overcome by a paralyzing fear of dying. And my loneliness was suddenly the loneliness of death. It was like in a dream, where you want to scream, but you can't. - Good day. My name is Nurse Rut. - Berg. Nurse Brogren. - Address? - Brahegatan 58. - Phone number? - 67-68-08. Is there another number to call after delivery? No, no need to call at all. - No relatives? - No. - Nobody? - No, nobody. Okay, let's get undressed and then we'll do a protein test and... - Does everybody scream? - I'm sorry? - I was wondering if people scream? - Not everybody. - Sounds horrible. - What? The screaming. Some people feel better when they do it. Does Nurse Rut have any children? No. Why do you ask? No reason. If you can, please go urinate in there. It'll probably be another six to eight hours. I can't be more exact. If it intensifies, you can ring the buzzer, but keep in mind we're busy. The pain subsided, and I sank into a state in between sleep and wakefulness. The shadows of leaves on the wall transformed into cancan girls. It was funny. Almost as in a film. I was in Paris again, in that awful nightclub. It was late at night. Yes, it was my neighbor at the hotel on rue Saint Martin. The Swedish painter who was always so diligent with his paintings and his amorous adventures. We had only said hello in passing, but I have to admit that his indifference towards me irritated me. Lovers aren't funny, because they're lovers Just a bit, because he was cute. Attention. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to announce a contest which should be just as interesting for the audience as for the contestants. We shall see if amongst you there is a woman who can hold a two-franc piece between her thighs. The winner will receive this enormous bottle of champagne. Let's begin, ladies. No. Open the door, but only a crack Marta is a blossoming tree She is a bright little fish Why are your eyes so sad, Marta? Your true love Is sitting outside your door Right now, my love has no limit Yes, eternal is my love for you At this moment Let me be born through you again Let us play in front of the poor The sick, the terrible Let us play in front of death itself My sister, my bride My blossoming tree Good-bye, dear. My husband leaves tomorrow! GYNECOLOGIST Good day. I'm Fredrik Lobelius, Martin's brother. Paul Lobelius. Martin's oldest brother. You... Yes. Paul and I have been on a trip in southern Spain with our wives. Two days ago we were painfully notified that our father had suddenly passed. We immediately headed for home and decided to stop and pick up Martin. My brother has explained two things during our ten minutes here. One: He's not coming to Father's funeral. Two: He intends to marry you, Miss Berg. I've been forced to point out to my brother... One: He can't count on the same economic support as when Father was alive. Two: If he intends to marry, he has to secure a job with which he can support himself and a wife. Three: Forget the possibility of having an idle position at the family company. Martin has misunderstood us. He thinks we want to hurt and embarrass him. Nothing to dwell upon. An artist's blood runs hot from time to time. Martin has always been a bit suspicious of others. More serious, however, is that he refuses to honor his father. Out of respect for Mother he should... I'm not going to say anything more. Shut up! Funny, considering the love Mother and Father always had for you. It's also funny to observe your reactions to their affections and care. I've always been grateful for my father's love, affection, care, goodness, gentleness, discipline, fatherliness, wisdom and sacrifices. I think it's good... both for us and for him... that he's dead. Martin has chosen the wrong occupation. He should have been a playwright. - We are in a hurry. - Very true. We've told Martin that he can pick up 150,000 francs from our representative. That's about 2,000 kronor. It'll be the last money you receive in Paris. If you want to come home, the ticket will be paid for by telegraph. Good-bye, Martin. - Good afternoon, Miss Berg. - Good afternoon. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Good-bye, Martin. Now be sensible. - Good-bye, Miss Berg. - Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Martin. Martin? Do you want me to tell you something pleasant? Do you? Something pleasant has happened. I've been to... We are... I'm... Father is dead. It's fantastic. I never imagined the possibility that Father could die. Martin. Go away. I want to be alone for a while. Go away. Didn't you hear what I said? Come, Marta. Let's go celebrate the old man's demise. I wanted to tell you something. It's important. - Not now, Marta. - Yes, but... Are you coming or not? The offer won't last forever. Marta. He said four when I served the aperitif. Excuse me, sir. Thank you very much. You look distressed, Marta dear. Are you worried about something? Aren't you worried about the future? To be honest, this is as worried about the future as I am. - Do you know what I'm planning? - No. I'm going home for the old man's funeral to repair my tarnished reputation. Painting is important to me, as you know, and I don't want to lose my allowance. I understand. I'll probably leave tomorrow. - Of course. - Will you be here when I return? No. No, I don't think so. What are you going to do? I'll start at the university. You know that. - Maybe we'll see each other again soon. - Yes. The cutest. You're very cute tonight. And serious. Are you sad because we're separating? A little. Aren't you? Yes, of course. We can both agree that we've had a lot of fun together. Yes. I'm so hopelessly unstable. It's almost a problem for me. But you're pretty free-spirited yourself. It comforts me a bit. Yes. Maybe we'll meet again and play different games. Who knows. Shall we go? Yes. I've paid. Marta, what were you going to tell me this afternoon that was so important? If I leave early tomorrow, there won't be a lot of time to talk. - Nothing. - But you seemed so eager. No. I was only kidding. Taxi. Taxi. Let's push real hard and we'll soon be ready. Now we can call the anesthesiologist. How is the baby going to come out? My stomach is still just as big. It'll never be born. It'll never be born. Breathe deeply. Now she can sleep. Count. One, two, three, four, five. - Is it a girl? - See for yourself. That was a real nice story. But why did you end up marrying Martin? I love him. You should have lived on your own with your child and fought for yourself. That would have been style. You ruined it by compromising. - Life isn't so stylish, dear Maj. - Life is what you make of it. Yes, absolutely. Our dear men are running late. Shall I heat up the coffee? That's a good idea. Karin has to tell her story. I don't have much to tell. But it's funny. I'll tell you while the coffee is brewing. Let's go into the kitchen. Maj, come. Henrik. Hi. Henrik, you're here already. How fun. Did you escape my uncles? How are you? You look sad. Has something happened? Are you sad? I'm awfully happy to see you. I'm so mad, I'm about to fall to pieces. Come, let's talk. Let's go to the dock. We'll be alone there. Listen to this misery. Dad, Uncle Fredrik and Eugen have decided that I'm to join the firm. Have you ever heard a dumber idea? Therefore I'm supposed to go to business school. I start in September. I told them I don't want to. "Do you have a better suggestion?" said Uncle Fredrik, with that look on his face that only he has. It didn't come out that I'd rather travel and see the world, so I said no and looked like an idiot. "Then it's decided," said Uncle Fredrik, and the brothers looked like they were looking at an open grave. - Dad too. - Typical. "I think you'll enjoy it," said Dad. I said, "No," but couldn't say anything else because I almost started crying. - That's lousy. - It's incredibly lousy. I only know one thing, and that's either to commit suicide or leave everything behind. If you die, I also want to die. You understand I can't have that on my conscience. Then there's only one option. - We leave. - We leave. We run away. I've already planned the whole thing. I'll withdraw my money from the bank. - Me too. - Do you have a passport? - You know I do. - Yes, I forgot. - When are we leaving? - Now, tonight. Immediately. Everything's packed and ready in town. We only need your things. In the morning we'll catch the 8:00 train to Copenhagen and from there to Paris. When the money's gone, we hitchhike to my friend's place in Italy. He's promised that we can stay for cheap. How fun, Henrik. How terribly fun. I love you so. Let's leave tonight. Go pack, but be careful. In the meantime, I'll write a letter to Mom and Dad. - Hurry up. - Bye. No, my story isn't even a story. It's just a comical episode. The company's centennial celebration had just ended. The guests had left, and we were tired and happy. - Mother, dear. - Mother, dear. Cheers. Miss Viola, we're leaving. - Good-bye, Mother. - Good-bye, Mother. - Sleep well. - Sleep well, Mother. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Can I speak with you, or have you had too much to drink? - How is your wife? - She isn't my wife. Annette said she saw her in town and she looked to be in her last month. - So what? - Do you live together? She's staying at her parents who are away. Shouldn't you... "Shouldn't I..." She doesn't care about me. She doesn't want anything to do with me. I actually understand her very well. She won't even talk to me on the phone. I've begged her to marry me, but she doesn't want to. Can you believe it? She says that I'm incorrigible. She won't even give me a chance. Karin. Come, let's go. I'm coming. Bye. - I have the car. Do you want a ride? - No, thank you, Fredrik. Annette and I will take a little walk. Will you allow me to be an hour late to the office tomorrow? Idiot. Come next week if it amuses you. Good night. It probably wouldn't amuse me. Do you want your hat? - Good-bye, dear. - My hat. - Good-bye. - Good night. You drive. I've had two drinks. Just think. There is almost a statistical certainty that every family like ours will have a black sheep, someone incompetent. I mean Eugen. An accountant... Paul. And finally somebody competent. And that competent somebody is you, of course. Yes, why not? I've made Father's company into a worldwide organization in which we own 79% of the shares. Personally, I am in the prime of my life, full of job satisfaction, energy and great ideas for the future which appears quite bright. My children are talented and well behaved. I have a beautiful wife. I'm revolutionizing our export industry. I have no enemies. I'm a little drunk. You don't have any friends either. No, not necessary. I feel fine. I sleep well. My stomach's fine. Good teeth. Can hold my liquor. Champion of the bowling club. Can I ask for more? No. It is as if life's annoyances abruptly fled the moment I showed myself. You truly are exceptional. I discern the sarcasm in your tone, but I don't care, Karin dear. No man is great in the presence of their wife. No. God is probably not married. By the way, I think you could have worn more clothes on an evening like tonight. I was terrified that the décolletage would fall into the ice cream. Most likely you were half-naked just to annoy me. How did you guess? At your age, you should wear more clothes. - Jealous? - No, just a little upset. You should be happy I managed to keep your brother Martin under control. It could have turned into a speech. What about his concubine? I ran into her on Sturegatan Street yesterday. She looked ready to give birth. What? Give birth. You know, that indisposition that happens to women on occasion. I'll be damned. I thought she looked decent. Her reputation is supposedly not the best. - You know that? - You hear things. She looked decent anyway. At your age, dear Fredrik, one easily confuses the characteristics of young attractive women. It supposedly has something to do with internal secretions. Thank you for that. By the way, you have shaving cream in your ear. - What? - You have shaving cream in your ear. You've known all night and didn't say a word. I received the crown prince with... This makes you... The crown prince was staring with fascination at one of your ears. It was white like a glacier. I thought he seemed absentminded. - Of course he... - It was so cute. - You're a damn... - Think of your blood pressure. No. Yes. No. - Finally home. - I've told Inga a hundred times to bring up the stroller. You never know what kind of people walk by here. Okay, let's go. It's been a great night for all of us. We have every reason to be happy. A great night. I'm proud of you, Fredrik Lobelius. Well, that was definitely exciting. - Let's stay calm. - Have I said a word? The first thing to do in this situation is to press the distress button. That's this red button. There. - I don't hear anything. - Naturally. The bell is in the janitor's quarters. He'll awaken and in a few minutes come to our rescue. - Are you sure? - Calm down and have a seat. I'm completely calm. I think you're the one who seems nervous. Not in the least. - Are you going to smoke? - Does it bother you? Yes, especially if we're going to sit here all night. We might run out of air. That's the silliest thing I've ever heard. - Did you hear that? - No. I hear footsteps. It's the janitor. That's it. It worked. - I don't hear any footsteps. - Quiet. No, it's just some pipe rattling. Hello? Hello? You sound like an old cuckoo clock. Really? Why don't you try it? No. No, you need a woman for this. Watch this. - Did you hurt yourself? - No! But my cigar and my glasses are destroyed. That's what happens when women fix things. Did I build the elevator? The builder's mother was most likely a woman. Let's not get excited. This is definitely not a laughing matter. Have you seen your top hat? Yes, that's funny. For you. You look like a clown. After careful consideration, I see only one way out, and it's not very good. What is it, my love? Do you know that I have a feeling you arranged all of this and that you're enjoying it? Shouldn't I be happy that I get to spend time alone with my darling husband for once? Almost indefinitely. Very kind of you, Kajsa dear. I see only one way out of our dilemma, and that's to scream for help and hope that somebody hears us. Isn't that a bit ridiculous? It's possible. If I can confess something to you, Karin, it is that the worst thing I know next to snakes, rats and communists is to be trapped in a very small space. I'm actually sweating a little. The strong displays a weakness. Hooray. Hooray. - I think I'll remove my coat. - Yes, I think you should. Okay, let's yell. But not just anything: "Help, help!" and the like. It seems unnecessarily hysterical and disorganized. Couldn't agree more. Once again the misplaced sarcasm. I think we yell "Hello." Plain and simple. Both of us. At once. Okay. Let's yell. One, two, three. Hello! One, two, three. Why didn't you yell? The bulb is loose. We ought to tighten it. Let it be, my darling. Sweetheart, don't be sad. I'm sure they'll save us before we starve to death or start eating each other. - Darling. - What? My knees hurt. A thousand apologies. I'll sit in the stroller or on the floor. - Can't I sit in your lap? - That too? Fifteen years ago you'd have been lucky to sit like this with me. Don't be silly. Fifteen years ago you weighed less. You're no Adonis yourself. Or what do the little girls say? Women have a way of being shameless even with their husbands. What do your young ones say, the lapdogs you surround yourself with? Don't you know that women really blossom after 35? No. I refuse to know it. Too bad. We could have a lot of fun, you and I. It creaked. - Was it you? - The bench. It's not strong enough. I don't want to fall down with you. This is not a farce. Can't we kiss each other in the cover of darkness? Sit on the bench. - What's that sound? - I don't know. Poor Fredrik, you're hungry. Your tummy is rumbling. Honestly, a few sandwiches and a beer would taste great right about now. You don't eat much at parties. Wait. I have a chocolate bar in my purse. - Want a piece? - No, thank you. - But it satisfies. - No, thank you. As you wish. Please give me a piece. Chocolate might taste better now than when I was a child. Well? Yeah. Karin. - You want another piece? - Yes, please. Too bad. All gone. Listen, Kajsa. Kajsa is all ears. Now that we're all alone for once, we could, just for fun, be honest with each other and then forget what we said in the morning. I tremble for what comes next. I've often wondered if you... Go ahead. Ask. It sounds so ridiculous, and you might get the wrong idea. This is becoming an opera overture. Have you ever been unfaithful to me? Sure. Really? And you acknowledge it just like that? You asked me. And if I would have asked yesterday or tomorrow? I would have still said yes. Really? That's interesting. - Do you want to sit down? - I'm fine standing. As you wish. Has this occurred often with different people? Yes, of course. What did you think? Do you have a lover at the moment? You see, right now it's a bit tricky. I have two prospects, but I don't know which one to choose. - Exciting, don't you think? - Incredibly. Maybe you can help me choose. - Me? - Yes. No, you know what, Karin? I think you are, how should I say, a bit strange. - I am still your husband. - You supposedly are. Why do you say that? How many times have you been unfaithful to me? - Me? - Yes, you, Fredrik Lobelius. How many times and with how many women have you been unfaithful? I don't think I need to respond to such an unusually stupid question. By all means. I have never been unfaithful to you. What I said was just in fun. Don't try. - You don't have any proof. - Neither do you. - Actually, I do. - What? - Now you're scared, aren't you? - Well, well, well. I think you're bluffing, dear Karin. I'll just say a name. Diana. Diana. He's blushing. Blushing like a schoolboy. Like a little boy caught with his fingers in the cookie jar. Diana. Yes, by all means. She was crazy, so it ended very quickly. She wasn't completely crazy, unless possibly from love. Did you know that that 19-year-old American put two detectives on you? - Must have been expensive. - What the hell? Yes, just think how nasty women can be. For two years, she watched your every step. And last week she boarded a flight in Copenhagen. Do you know where she went? - She's spoken to you? - Yes, she has. And she's left me a little list of all your adventures over the last two years. Do you know what she's doing now? You're just kidding. There's no truth to what you say. I have the list here in my purse. - We can read it together. - No, thank you. I think I'm going to sit down on the floor. I'll just sit on my coat. Right now, the energetic girl is seeking out all your other lady friends and giving them the list. They include a biography and everything. I see. You haven't been moving in the best circles. No. Women are women. We all have the same bodily equipment, more or less perfect. I'm assuming it wasn't just for spiritual companionship. Little Diana, indeed. Who would have thought she had that kind of energy? She'd almost be a good hire for the firm. - Was it fun? - Should I be honest? Try if you can. It was fun. Almost every episode I've had has been fun. I've never regretted it. - Like a good dinner. - Almost, but more fun. - I like women. - And despise them. Not any more than I despise myself, which isn't much. Have you had any reason to complain? - No. - No. Why couldn't you tell me about all your episodes? We've never discussed it before. - That's been the problem. - No, it was the smart thing. Each of us lives our own lives. We raise our children. We have our home together. The rest is complete freedom, complete discretion. C'est tout. - Ouch. What now? - My leg has fallen asleep. Wait. I'll rub it for you. No, I've forbidden you to wear short underwear. You get rheumatism. It feels nice when you rub. You were a good physical therapist once upon a time. You'll get to massage me in the mornings like before. Thank you, dear God. Does it feel better now? Hey, you. You are so damn strong. I've always had a great deal of respect for you. Don't say that, Fredrik. Sometimes I've thought, "What couldn't we accomplish together, with our intelligence, our combined force?" Idiot. Can you let go of my hair? It hurts. People shouldn't keep asking each other for forgiveness and all that nonsense. Tomorrow I'll call Mom and ask if she can take care of the house. Because on Thursday you're coming with me to Belgium. Why am I going to Belgium? You're traveling as my secretary. - Mrs. Aronson at the office... - I'll take care of Mrs. Aronson. - Are you serious? - Definitely. - I'm not going to get my hopes up. - No, Kajsa. It's an experiment. Before the trip is over, you might hate me, and I, you. But if you want to, we'll do the experiment. "Better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all," I believe is what the poet said. Hey, I have something to confess. - Save it for later. - No, it should be said now. Out with it then. That part about the list was a lie. The only thing I knew was your story with Diana. Oh, you. Yes, where do I get it all from? That part about the lovers, was that also... Slightly true. Slightly true? Jealous? A bit. It pleases me. It pleases me, my dear. It pleases me, my Othello. We should have ended up in broken elevators more often during our 13-year marriage, you and I. What do you think? I know nothing. What did you say? Nothing. Once, I told a good friend... "I love him with a passion that is both black and red." Who? You. You. What do you like least about me? The bossy tone. "Really? Yes. Indeed." What do you like least about me? That you tease me. Am I teasing you now? Your cleavage is very becoming. Can you see that in the dark? No. Not see. A little dalliance in the elevator. It'll be something to tell the grandchildren. No. Be quiet. I'm not going to say a word. - What's that? - The elevator. - Excuse me. - You hit me. - It's cramped in here. - It's come loose. What's come loose? - I can't find my shoes. - They're on the floor. Here they are. They're here. Yes, but I need my coat. Wait. - Dear Lord, I thought they were dead. - Good morning. The distress button is broken. Yes, we know. I'm terribly sorry that Mr. and Mrs. Lobelius had to stand... - By all means. - Can you let us out now? Yes, yes. Just a little tweak, and you're out. - Good morning. - Good morning. Today the firm will be without a captain at the helm. - What will he be doing? - He's gone ashore. Sleeping in the arms of a bad girl. The entire day he'll sleep next to a bad girl. What is that? I remember. It's our Brazilian representative. He's coming on the night train. We have a conference at 10:00. I told him to call me as soon as he got here. Good-bye, beautiful captain. - But this is important. - No, it's not. No. Hello. It's you, Paul. Did you meet the train? Really? You are an example for your brother. I've been in an elevator. I'm just going to shave. Bye. I said in an elevator. Bye. Sometimes he just doesn't get it. Yes, that was some night. And I've traveled with him. A bit. Sometimes. And from time to time I get to massage his sore legs. What are you thinking of, Marta? Nothing. Martin. And how it will be when we see each other. If he'll hold me and laugh, or if he'll look sad and make me cry. Now it's Annette's turn. No, I have nothing to tell. Not even the slightest. It's terrible. But it's typical of Paul and me. They're coming! I was going to change my dress. No, I'm going to change. What are you doing? Henrik and I are running away. - Well, I'll be. - You don't have to be sarcastic. I'm a bit surprised, as you can imagine, since you're my little sister. I'll write Mom and Dad. There will be no running away. - Are you going to stop me? - Yes, I am. - With force maybe? - If necessary. Henrik can go where and however he pleases. But I'm responsible for you. Should you be talking about responsibility when you've been so irresponsible and done so much? I beg you not to go. But why? Do you have a reason? It's dumb. It's dumber to let Henrik be alone. I'll lose him. I love him just as much as you love your dumb Martin. Speak to Mom first. You can do that, can't you? - I beg you, Maj. - I don't care. Marta, Martin is standing down there wondering why you're not there to greet him. Marta, can't you see? Don't worry about me. I'll disappear quietly with Henrik. But you're just a little girl. No, I'm not a little girl. I know what I want, and I can take care of myself. At least as well as you other women. Henrik and I love each other. Not with compromises or as silly as you poor things. But for real. One hundred percent, you understand? - Haven't they grown this past week? - They're so cute. - Hi. - Hi. I told you it was too heavy. Swear that you'll always love me as much as tonight. I swear. Swear that we'll never compromise, never stray, never lie, cheat or behave like everybody else. I swear. Because otherwise we might as well be dead. Is that Henrik and Maj that can't start the motor out in the bay? I think so. - Paul, it's terrible. - What's terrible? They're running away. Abroad. - Really? - What can we do? I was bewildered. Let them run away. - What are you saying? - I'm saying let them run away. They'll be back in time. You think? The main thing is that they do something they think is forbidden. - Oh, Paul. - Let them have their summer. Soon enough, the hurt, the wisdom and all that other stuff will come. Isn't it starting to get a bit chilly? Shall we go in? - Oh, Paul. - Don't cry, Marta dear. I'm just so happy.
