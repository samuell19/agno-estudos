Hi. Good evening. -Are you driving the truck? -Yes. Would you mind giving me a lift? Where are you going? Anywhere. To the south. I'm travelling. Oh no. I'm heading north. to Recife. Oh. I see. Thank you very much, anyway. God bless you. Have a nice trip. Hi. All right brother? Where are you going? Me? I was going to the place I've just come back. Oh, I see. You've just arrived. Fine. We can talk later on. I'll be back in a minute. All right. We'll be here. Be happy! Are you all right? How are you? It's been almost two months I'm stopping here and I'm leaving already. -Yes? -Yes. You told me you were going to Jujuy. No. I never made it. I stopped over here. Have you seen Biano? He was with you. Yes. He came along with me. Well, someone has to follow me, anyway. Doesn't matter if it's good or bad. Did you come all the way from Rosario to here? Yes, there's a good thing about Rosario: if you want to get rid of Babylon, you get yourself a kayak, jump into the water and go to the island. I've already surfed with two kayaks. But when boats cross. What nice work. Is it Colombian? Colombian pre Columbus... There was no jobs, my son was an engineer and had to work as a taxi driver. My son chooses to work as a taxi driver because he'd rather keep living with you, having his breakfast, his laundry. He didn't want to go to the fields, to cross to the island. he didn't want to go to the other side... To have an alternative life. To grow as a person. It's not that alternative life whatsoever. It didn't mean he'd drop out. The Jesuits built this church. And when they arrived here... The plaza used to be an Indian cemetery. The altar is in front of the plaza. Where there is the altar it used to be an energy place for the Indians. All the white people, the church... They set up altars where... The Indian, in this case, their community... had this source of energy. They took off the Indian places of energy to impose theirs. And when they built their church, about 300 years ago, it's from the 17th century or something like that, the algarol tree was still small and was about 500 years old. And people today take pictures of the church and ignore the tree by its side. The important thing is what the grandparents had witnessed. They should consider the trees like grandparents. Ancestors. Under the branches of the plaza, where today the people sit and drink mate, before... there were grandparents, warriors... shamans, witches. Most of the Indian people here didn't live in tents, only in caves. The cave. There. Some people stay there. For days... No, I don't have any destination and I don't know for how long I'll be travelling. When I want to stop travelling I'll do it and come back to my place. But for the time being I'll keep travelling. I don't have any city or destination to go to. I'll keep walking, without destination. I don't have to be in any place. I don't have any compromise with anybody. I'm free. And I go where I want. Or to where there's an opportunity where I can learn something. What did you learn on the road? What I've learned in the road? I've learned many things, but the fundamental thing is: there are really good people and really bad ones. And you have to be wise. Because, if you are not wise they will get you. You cannot lose your mind for nobody or nothing. You have to trust in your intuition. Listen to advice. because there are people that know more than you, by experience or age. Or because they've been through situations that made them learn more or faster than others. Then you have to take the good and keep distance from the evil of each person. That's what I've learned in my trip. Hey, do you want to take a look in my work? Come on. You don't have to pay anything to see. It's a handcraft work. How much? Listen to me my brother. let's make a good deal. Usually I sell it for 5 reais but I'll do it for 3 reais. I don't have money on me now but I'll come back. No? Come back then and we sort the things out. I'm watching you. Do you want to see a little gem? Come over. Do you know what I've seen? I've never seen such a thing in any place I've been before. a rain of ants. It was raining ants, can you believe this? It was true my brother. This morning we went to visit a stone... And suddenly the ants started falling from the sky. The little ones with wings? That is it! With wings, falling. Yeah! That is it! We eat them here. If I say that, in another place, what I've seen here they will take me as a big liar. Let me talk to the girl. There are many gems. Quartz, Amethyst. I think the best way of living is to feel comfortable with your life. That's what I feel. I'm not a slave. I try to live without being a slave to no one else. I do my way. I maintain my family. I do what I want to do. And I pay a price for that. There's no free lunch. I live this way and show that's possible brother. It's possible. Believe me. I love you. I love you too. Hey, have you been to the Northeast of Brazil? No. That's the real Brazilian thing. We'd be like microbes over there. Ah? -Like microbes. -Yes. No bathing, no nothing. Full of rotten teeth with cavities. Good Afternoon. My name is Marcelo and she is Dhalinie Praia. We are from Manaus, Amazonas. We are artists, human beings, just like you. As we need some money we are going to pass our magic hat. If you can give us some help we'll appreciate that. Thanks. You are heading north to Manaus? No, he lived in Manaus. I've come from there. Have you been to São Luís? São Luís do Maranhão? I've met them in the beach of Pipa, travelling by bike. Nice one! We've been biking together since João Pessoa. The place I've earned more money in Brazil, in the traffic lights, was Petrolina. Where is Petrolina? Petrolina is in the border of Pernambuco - Bahia. Juazeiro in Bahia and Petrolina in Pernambuco. Trindade is so good, don't you think? The stone that swallows is pretty crazy, isn't? Have you been there? A swallow stone? Parati is not that good. Yes, they don't allow us to work over there. Yes, you can work there. You just have to be sly, just like with the immigration. Rio de Janeiro is worse. The police are quick over there. You are working with your mates and suddenly. Police! I've spent a long time trying to cross to Peru. But that border is a joke. The cop was like smoking. like that. Bolivia - Peru? Have you been there? There's no border. You just cross it and say: Hey brother, all right? Fine. It's like that. Peace and love. In the airport, arriving in Europe, Barajas, Spain. I was queuing up in order to produce my papers. We were all together. Then the spanish police came over and asked me: where are you from? Chile, I said. Ok, you can remain. Who comes from Colombia? All Colombians follow me please. All Colombians, Venezuelans and Bolivians went with him. And Brazilians and Chileans were allowed to cross. They ask me if I will never get married, if I don't want a house, a normal life. I don't want a normal life, for God sake. Leave me alone with my bike, on the road, in peace. I don't want a house, or a car. Nothing. But I've got a dog, a cat, and a bike. That's it. I'm happy. Thank you guys! If anyone wants to help the street jugglers. There's a guy over there, he cooks a broth that helps you to drive for hours. This broth is what they call. How do you say? Can be made of pork's feet, beans... I know, I'm aware of it. But you've said you drink it to drive. It must be made of amphetamine. I'm not sure if they don't use some kind of that thing to give us an up. Have you ever tried it? Yeah. It can be dangerous. I've taken loads of it. But nowadays we don't need it anymore. We've got work schedules. Once I've taken a ride with a guy who looks like a machine. He couldn't stop driving. Wired. His face was... Weird. It causes premature aging. And also it causes many things. When the effect goes off, the guy collapses. Have you got a paper? No. The one I had got wet. I think I've got the last one. Have you noticed the difference of the Uruguayan beaches? The sand here is completely different. For me it's the scenery. Yes, this island is so cool. Only the fact of having a rain forest is just amazing. The Atlantic rain forest. And with mountains. I've never seen that. I think when I come back to Buenos Aires the only thing I'll say in Portuguese is... "Can you give me something to eat?" Well, at least you've learned something. Yes. Very good. You also live in Buenos Aires. the concrete jungle. I'll always see the difference from here: the beach, the sea, listening to the wind. That's one thing I don't like in Brazil. You are in the middle of a forest, in peace, and then a plane just crosses. Even in Serra Gaucha it happens. Looking to the stars... I've caught myself thinking that the life of everyone is like a journey. Each person goes around getting different experiences that are part of their histories of life. A shooting star! We can sleep outside tonight. Yes. We'll leave very early tomorrow. We'll enjoy all day long. I hope it doesn't rain. I don't give a shit. I bumped into that guy the other day. He was a Flamengo soccer player in the 80's, Nunes. He got really mad with me. He went like: Do you remember me? I'm Nunes and I said: I don't give a shit, man, I'm a weirdo myself. So what? Chico got close to me. we're having a joint in the middle of the street. I mean, actually it was in a mangrove, and said: From now on I'll leave my job at Olinda city hall and I'll be a composer. Hey brother? Is it your work? What is the material? Silver plate. Have you got a spare one for me? Sorry, I don't. If I had one I'd swap with you. Can you see this stripe here? Get another piece over there. The booz is around. and I'm on the track. The money. I'm from Roda de Fogo. I'm a mechanical, injection. I deal with robotics. Robot? Robotics. Whatever it is, I don't give a shit. You're calling everybody attention. Only you. You're calling everybody attention. Let's make a deal? We'll learn together. Union makes the strength. If you don't understand this. But you weren't humble to us. Give him a punch. I want to see blood. But it's violence. Look, if he gets closer we'll beat him up. I've done everything right, and this guy. It doesn't exist. He's snitching on you to the cops, look at him there. You are a veteran of the Brazilian Army? Why you are using this gear of shit? Look how your belly is. I am about to punch you. You call me shit. I was defending my country. You disrespected me. You've served in the Army? What's your name and number? Come on soldier, name and number! Leave him alone. Let's go to Porto Seguro? Are you mad. What I am going to do there? São Thomé is mad, very cool. Many waterfalls. Look at the scenery. The twilight. Very cool. The more you get into the woods the better. Run away from all that technology. Digital TV, computers, you have to be careful with it. These things are the devil and if you don't take care they corrupt your spirit. But you've got to have the basics. A little tv, a black and white and noisy one. That's good. But you cannot have many things. Because in the end of it, the dude is going to freak out. Because he only goes into the material side. And what about his spirit? He even doesn't think of it anymore. His spirit gets flagellated. He doesn't even think in harmony with nature. Of sitting on the floor. Lay down. We can do it. Look how wonderful the sky is. The woods. Look the earth. What a beauty. Hi folks, I'll give you an explanation. This rock was being demolished, because in that time, before the inscriptions were discovered, this place was a quarry. Many also say that ET's made these inscriptions. They have five or six thousand years B.C. So, who on earth could have done those things. They are really old. And you can realize they were not an easy work to do. And, until now, it's a great mystery. That's all for today folks. They used to gather here. Where they used to have their ritual nights. Many affirm they were in a state of trance while doing this. They took herbs to not have a notion of what they were doing. These sites are an important symbol of History. But I don't have a clue about the significance of it. Some asked me about ET's, if I see lights spinning over the rock. I see. Others talk about calendars, books. They wanted to express themselves. This one is roots. I took some Macaíba nuts, you know them? Cool, it's good for toke pipes. They are good for necklaces too. Let's do handcrafts from roots. You speak Portuguese, I speak Castillian. But we all walk with the feet on the ground. The head in the sky and the heart in the chest. I am what I am, and here you see me. And you'll see me in any place of the world. And you will see the same. I do travel. It's my trip. Even if I don't have a car, I travel anyway. I'd travel hitchhiking, walking... The traveller isn't a commom person. I mean, in general... How are you? -Are you traveling? -Yes. Looking for a place? No.Traveling and working. Nomad. Yes. For now. Until we find a place that ... Until you can do it. No. Until we find a place that ... After a few years... Vision changes. All change. All change, of course. It would be very boring if you do not change. Yes. It would be very boring if we got always the same. It would be a joke. It's the duty of every Cuban to know how to shoot. I've swopped the pliers for a hoe. Maybe we come back to the road. We have dreams. A cart and a horse or. I don't know. But leaving the road was bad. Leon was conceived here in Villa Nueva. I'm almost sure of that. I've never seen such a great avenue, with so many people together. Corrientes Avenue. Crazy. In Buenos Aires. So many people together... One thing on the road is the vibes of life. Everything happens. What you are in need of pops up in front of you. That day we met in Recife we were like finishing a bottle of wine. It was the last one. Then you showed up and we ending up drinking three. In the back of the supermarket we used to take in the rubbish bin things that were in perfect condition. Delicious. Too much food. Have you cooked? Yes, of course. Everyday. We've been travelling with pot, ladle, frying pan, cutlery. What? Cutlery. Ah, you've learned that in Portuguese. We are always learning some new words. Everyone sees what is happening in the neighborhood. Behind the economic questions and crises. There are many so many empty houses left. Too much waste. We are using the tools the state provides itself. To others take profit of it. One year ago we'd tried to live without money, and in 8 months we'd just spent 30 pesos, about ten brazilian reais. And during this time we brewed about 50 bottles of wine and recorded 10 records. We're like dedicated to it and I don't know if we are going to make it that again. Well. We are the modern Indians. The little greens. Any kind of work dignifies a man. It's part of the economy. Grapes. It's very important to not mess around with the poor's economics because it can grows to a passive genocide. Little grapes. This is my favorite lettuce. Sounds good, doesn't it? Oh! My favorite. Tasty. Sometimes I dream with the garbage truck. It comes to get the greens. I heard its noise and started having palpitations with the garbage truck. Rockets. Good. The industries are here to make profits, not to spend money. Then, they don't spend money to know how its products affect people. And even less about the combination of their chemicals. We all know that diet coke and mints are explosive combination to the bellies. We have to stick around the posture of each other. Each one is its center. This tomato. No. We've been protesting, for 10 years about... the return of our lands. And that generates more problems. It has drawn bloodshed. On the 23rd day of 2003, I mean, 2010... at 18:30. A comrade of us died. An attack of the police of Formosa. Before, everything was covered by silver. Everything? Yes. You're saying. The whole world. You're saying the whole world was covered. Was made of silver? You are going to see the miners with their masks, covered by dust. That's the legacy the silver mountain leaves to us. This mine is 466 years old. when the miners, the Indians, started working here in April of 1545. What was the progress in all this time. Nothing. Only drilling machines. Don't worry life is a hole. We look through a hole, we listen through a hole, we talk through a hole, we eat through a hole, we piss through a hole, we shit through a hole, we born through a hole, we ejaculate through a hole and when we die we go to a hole. So, my friend, don't worry. Life is a hole. In Macchu Picchu, the land of the governor of the Incas, of Atawalpa, Waynacapa and others, there was a system of messengers, the Chasquis. They were selected and prepared. It wasn't to everyone, no. A Chasqui had to be about 18 years old, athletic, big enough to have long steps. Because they had to run 40 to 45 km a day. Here in the mine who are the ones selected to be messengers? Kids of 13, 14 years old. Who are they? They are not Chasquis, they are Chibatos. They are the messengers of their chiefs that are using drilling machines.
