[theme music] Oh, Mrs. Moncrieff. Yes? Just one moment. Oh it was freezing in the park. I'm longing for my tea. Uh, could you tell me yet whether you will be here for Christmas? Oh, dear, I hope not. I do hope not. Are there any letters for me? Well, the afternoon post has come in, but I haven't had a moment to sort it yet. I wonder if you'd mind just looking? Certainly. For 30 years, ever since my husband died, I've been living in hotels. But I've never yet spent a hotel Christmas. Uh, the management prides itself on creating a family atmosphere here. Oh, yes, but the-- it's never quite the same, is it? You see, I always go to Norfolk, to my sister's. But she died, poor darling, in the spring. So this year, I'm not quite sure what will happen. Your post, Mrs. Moncrieff. Oh, thank you. Oh. [envelope tearing] Arlington, eh? I shall not be here for Christmas. What a lucky old thing, Buggie. You know, I'd give a lot to live in the west of Ireland. Why don't you come over for Christmas, Dick? We'd love to have you. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't. Oh, what are you up to? I always do the same thing at Christmas. I go and stay with some cousins of mine called Gregory in Norfolk. Gregory? That's an Irish name. Yes, but you wouldn't know him. He's a parson. They've got a little place called Wyndenham. [chuckles] What you laughing at? I was laughing at the idea of you spending Christmas at a vicarage. [chuckles] A bit incongruous, isn't it? Well, I might have to spend all my life at a vicarage. I nearly went into the church. What? MAN: What? When I was leaving school, my father came to me and he said, Dick, my boy, it's time you made your mind up what you're going to do. Your mother and I have been talking it over, and we've come to the conclusion you've got a choice of two things-- soldier or clergyman. Well, I thought it over, and I said clergyman. My father burst out laughing. And then six months later, I went to Sandhurst. I met a girl called Gregory the other night at the Orchid Room, a streamlined bit of work, session expert or something. Mm, that's it. Now she's the daughter. Matter of fact, I'm driving her down. Yes, this is the Associated Fashion News. Miss Gregory? Who wants Miss Gregory? Colonel Wyndham, I'm afraid she's out at the moment. Can I take a message. I'm driving her down to the country tomorrow. I wanted to know where to pick her up. You don't know where I could find here, do you? Just a moment. I'll look in her book. I think she's at a dress show. Yes, she is. You can ring her at Mayfair 8272. Now this is definitely a very dramatic dress for a very special occasion. Excuse me, is Miss Gregory here? She's wanted on the phone. Oh, I'm sorry. She isn't here. Try her home. As I was saying, the hoop is attached to this dress. It's very lovely. [phone ringing] Not going away for Christmas? Oh, dear, why ever not? I can't leave Blossom. NEIGHBOR: Does seem a shame you're losing your Christmas holidays just for the sake of a cat. I suppose you wouldn't trust him with me, would you? With you? You know, I believe I would. Well, I'm only next door. And you do so enjoy going to your brother's for Christmas, don't you? I do, indeed. They have a beautiful house up there in Norfolk, at that place called Wyndenham. I'm very fond of it. Oh, is he a clergyman, you said? Yes, he is. This is my nephew. He looks like a clergyman's son, don't he? I mean, he's nice-looking. I better just stay and see you over. Yeah. [clattering] Hey! You there. Who's that? Oh, hell. Answer when you're spoken to! Sir. What's your name? Gregory, sir. Haven't you just put in for the 48 for Christmas? Yes, sir. Well you've had it. You'll be eating cold meat here instead. Now get down off that wall! Well-- SERGEANT MAJOR: Come on, jump to it! Yes, sir. [clattering] [thud] Come here. You cut along home, ducks. It's past your bedtime. Go on, hop it. You see you're going the proper way this time. And don't try those games again. Yes, sir. Please, sir? Well, what is it? About that pass, sir, it's rather important I should get home for Christmas. - Oh, no it isn't. You're in the Army now. There's nothing important about you. Right, sir. I want to see the major, please. Well, you can't. I thought there was an ACI that said the man had a right see the OC at any time. Oh, I see, one of those budding barrack room lawyers, eh? No wonder you're no good, son. May I see the major, please, sir? Yes, you can see the major all right-- tomorrow morning, 0900 hours, Battery Office. You're not in charge! Get. Yes, sir. Get moving. [marching commands] Gunner Gregory, sir. 10359 Gunner Gregory, M. Sir. You are charged under Section 40 of the Army Act in that after lights out, you returned to the barracks by climbing the barrack wall. Well, Sergeant Major? At 00 hours and 2 minutes this morning-- Let's have it in English, Sergeant Major. Yes, sir. It was just after midnight last night. That's better. Go on. I found this man on top of the wall, behind the cookhouse. He had no late pass and admitted he was climbing into barracks. He was being assisted by a young person, sir. A young person? A girl, sir. Oh. Is this true, Gregory? Yes, sir. - Is that all, Sergeant Major? - No, sir. Well, go on. Well, I happen to remember accused asked for the 48 for Christmas. I told him he'd get it. I beg your pardon, sir, I mean, to forget it. I thought that was sufficient. Very lenient, Sergeant Major. Yes, sir. Well, why is he here? He refused to take my word, sir. Asked to see the OC, behaved in a very insubordinate manner, and quoted AC Highs at me, sir. That was very unwise of you, Gregory. Well, sir, I, um, want to apply for leave on compassionate grounds. Reason? MICHAEL GREGORY: Well, sir, my mother's just died. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. When? It was the last, um, May, sir. But the point is-- Last May, 8 months ago? You seem to think the Army's got a very tender heart, Gregory. Well, sir, the point is that, you see, my father is a parson. And you know-- Stay [inaudible]! And so we've always rather made rather a thing about Christmas. And this year, my sister's got to cope on her own. I said I'd tried to get back and help her if I could. Of course, it doesn't really matter, sir. No, it certainly doesn't matter. I have never had a less adequate reason for compassionate leave. I never heard such nonsense. 7-day CB. [inaudible] short and accused, left hand, left rear, [inaudible]. [marching commands] Mr. Young, sir, just a moment. Any reason why I shouldn't have it? [paper tearing] [whistle] Oh, this will do. This is the ride for Wyndenham? Yes, ma'am. Change at Norrie. Thank you so much. You have been kind. Thank you. Bridget. Good gracious, how are you? Oh, this is nice. We can travel together. Now come in here. There's plenty of room. Is it a corner seat? Yes, look, you can sit there. Oh, I'm third class. Oh, it doesn't matter. We can pay the guard. Ah, no. Oh, no, Bridget, we must be together. I'll pay. No, thanks. Oh, no, but Bridget, you know, really, there's no need. I prefer it here. Oh, very well, then, I'll have to come in with you. Uh, porter-- porter, just bring my things in here, please, will you? Oh, do you mind just moving up just a little bit so that I can sit down? No, madam, not at all. Looking very well in Seattle. Oh, the castles are [inaudible].. [engine roars] [MUSIC - "THE HOLLY AND THE IVY"] (SINGING) The holly bears a bark as bitter as any gall. And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ for to redeem us all. And the rising of the sun and the running of the deer. The playing of the merry organ, sweet singing in the choir. The holly bears a berry as red as any blood. And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ for to redeem-- Jenny. Hey, Jenny. David. You going to be long? Nowhere near finished. What time is it? It's time you got home. Aren't you expecting swarms of relations? Shh, listen. [all singing] (SINGING) The holly and the ivy, when they are both full grown, of all the trees that are in the wood, the holly bears the crown. Come on. Don't you like carols? They're all right. [inaudible] talk with you before the old canon. Oh, there's no more to be said. Do you think I'm putting too much frost? A lot more to be said, if you ask me. Wait a minute. It's so lovely. [singing continues] Strange how sound can be so beautifully still. Yeah, that's beautiful. Come on, let's go [inaudible]. [chuckles] Give me a moment. (SINGING) Sweet singing in the choir. The holly bears a berry as red as any blood. And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ, for to redeem us all. Ooh! [laughing] [door closes] Come here. Darling. My darling. I suppose people who fall asleep in the snow feel like this. They know they've got to keep awake. But just for a moment, they give up the struggle because the snow's so warm and cozy. Never heard yet of anyone freezing to death from a kiss. No, but it's also pointless, isn't it? It gets us nowhere. I know about that. It's got a lot of people an awful long way before now. No, no, no, David, please. [door opens] [inaudible] that chain's broken. Who are you doing all this for? You've got children coming or what? No, no children, none of the people we always have for Christmas. Would you give it to me, please? It's only what we always do. Oh, and the bell. Well, don't you like it? Yes, it's pretty. [chuckles] It's an awful waste of time. [laughs] I think you're mad-- stark, staring, raving mad. Hey, come on down. I want to talk to you. David, I must finish over here soon. Jenny, I've heard. It's all fixed. David. That's what I came to tell you. They want me to sail at the end of January. I've written to know will I'll be taking my wife with me. I told them yes. David, you know it's impossible. You know I can't leave Father. That's absurd. Of course, you can. Darling, it's not absurd. There's no one else. I must look after him. Can't you understand that? I must. It's all nonsense. Look, when it comes to a conflict between the children and the parents, it's the parents that have to give way. Otherwise, human life couldn't go on. You're talking like a textbook, David. Maybe I am, but you know me. Not having the words alone for saying these things, but you know what I mean. Look, what there is between you and me is-- well, it's what the whole of life depends on. It's much too important to be sacrificed to the interests of the old. That's why there's always a conflict. But this isn't a conflict. This is what I feel for someone I love. Do you not love me too? Well, then it's suicidal. Look, you're 31 now. It'll be another five years before I come back from South America. You'll be 36 then. That's middle-aged. I know. Look, Jenny-- I shouldn't have said that. It's not true, anyway. 36 is nothing. I'm 34 myself. [chuckles] Look, there's nothing to worry about. I'll have a word with your father. No, David, you mustn't. Well, why not? He's a reasonable man. He wouldn't expect-- Well, of course he wouldn't. But you don't understand. That's the whole point. If Daddy knew about you and me, he wouldn't ask me to stay. However much he wanted me to, he wouldn't let me stay. That's why he mustn't know about us at all. You won't tell him, will you promise? [door closes] Oh, oh, good gracious. Daddy. I've been asleep. What time is it? It's nearly 6:00. Oh, good gracious, are you sure? Oh, hello, David. What is it, Daddy? Are you all right? Yes, I'm all right, just a bit giddy for a moment. I woke with a start, you see, thinking I'd forgotten all about the children. What children? The infants that are having their Christmas treat. Well, you needn't go, surely. You're not well enough. If I'm not well enough to do my work, I'd better give up. That's all. I'll get your coat. Well, how about you, David? Have you heard anything yet? Aye, it's all fixed. I'm to sail at the end of January. Oh, you're a lucky fellow. You know, I always wanted to go to South America, ever since I was a boy. When I was first ordained, I made up my mind to go there, as a missionary, you know. But it never came off. No, I-- I never meant to stay puttering about in England all my life. Ah, well, there you are. But South America has always had a fascination for me, ever since I first read Prescott, "The Conquest of Peru." Aw, that's a wonderful book now. Have you read it? No, I can't say that I have. Well, it's about the place here, somewhere. You know where it is, Jenny, the big, fat red book? I won it as a prize for Latin verses when I was at school at Dublin. You know, that was the first time I realized the size of human history. It's all about the Incas, you know, remarkable people, the Incas, great mathematicians, sun worshippers, and-- and the first to discover the value of guano as a manure. Is that so? Yes, you should tell your father about that. He'd be interested, being a farmer. Glasses, darling. Hm. Guano is a deposit of seabirds. It's found all down those coasts. The Incas were the first to discover its value, a great, civilized people, the Incas. Now there's scarcely a trace of them left. All vanished, all except the guano trade. That's a big, modern industry. Well, I'm going out there to build aerodromes. Aerodromes, now people want aerodromes. You know, I often think it must very pleasant to be doing something people want. That's the worst of being a parson. Nobody wants you. Well, at least they do and they don't. If you don't go near them, they say, here am I. I'd been in the place six months, and the parson never comes near me. And if you do go, they say, what's he want to come poking his nose in here for? And you'd better go, darling, if you're going. Oh, yes. Here, here, you want a torch for coming back. Hm. Her mother was just the same, you know, David. I don't know what I'd do without her. Have we whiskey in the house for Richard? Yes. Leave it out on the side where he can help himself. Darling, it's so frightfully expensive. We can't have Richard helping himself whenever he feels like it. We can't have people here then if we can't afford to entertain them properly. Have you got your galoshes on? Yes, yes, yes, I've got them on. Would you-- would you care for a glass, David? DAVID: No, thank you, sir. - Darling, you must go. You don't want to be out when they all come. No, that's true. When's Margaret coming? Uncle Richard's driving her down. You-- you haven't met my younger daughter, have you, David? She-- we don't see her very often now, of course. She's a journalist you know, writes articles on fashions for the ladies' magazines. Like, you wouldn't think that would be an interesting subject, would you now? But it's an extraordinary thing. I find myself enthralled reading about the autumn collections. The trouble they take now with the silhouette, I had no idea of it, hip lines, waistlines. It's almost a branch of engineering. Ah, it is, and Margaret's an expert. Darling, you must go. Going, I've gone. [door closes] You see? Aye. [door slams] Look, what about this sister of yours? Why can't she come home? She won't. Why not? She just won't. She's got her job and her friends in London. What about your aunt? You haven't met Aunt Lydia, have you? Is that the old Irish [inaudible]?? No, that's Aunt Bridget. She's Daddy's sister. Aunt Lydia is Mommy's sister. She's rather grand and strange. She's the widow of a king's messenger. He died when they'd only been married a few years. And ever since, she's gone about feeling she has a special understanding of men. It's no use. I'm the only one. I've got to stay. You could find him a housekeeper, couldn't you? I mean, it's not such a terrible thing for a man to live alone, is it? Well, it's always worse for a parson. He can't do the most ordinary things simply because he is a parson. For instance, he can't just drop into the pub in the evenings when he's bored for company. People don't want him. Of course not. A pub's no place for a parson. No, but it's the same wherever he goes, whatever he does. People just don't feel free to behave naturally when he's there. Yeah, I know what you mean. There's an awkwardness. I noticed it myself in the railway carriages. Everyone stops talking for a moment when a parson gets in. Aw, that's just it. A parson's sort of set apart, isolated. It's a difficult situation. I see that. But I don't see why it should all fall on you. Look, that sister of yours must take her turn. I told you, she won't. I suppose being older, I've always felt more responsible. And you'd feel that more being the homemaking type. You don't really know me, do you? When we were small, I was always the one that wanted to get away. Margaret was a stay-at-home. Somehow, it hasn't worked out like that. I'm sure if you'd told her about you and me, she'd help you out a bit. I mean, she's been knocking around London all these years. She's had plenty of opportunity to pick up a man. You've managed that for yourself, even though you are stuck away in the country. Why, that gives you a sort of biological priority. I'm sure if we asked her, she'd give you a break. I'll ask her. But I don't think it'll be any use. Well, you're not going to let everything depend on her, surely? It does, I'm afraid. It just does. Now this is the sort of job I've had in mind ever since I started to qualify. Nearly 20 years, ever since I was 14, I've been working towards a job like this. But if I have to choose between it and you, it's no use to me. Jenny, [sighs] look, I don't mean to upset you. [whistling] [door closes] [gong sounds] Hello, hello, hello. Anybody there? Well, hello, chums. Mick, I thought you couldn't get leave. Oh, I wrangled it, 48 hours, compassionate. What do you mean, "compassionate"? Well, the Army is very sentimental at Christmas. Hello, David. - Hello, Mick. How did you fix it? Well, I went to see the major and pitched a tale. That's one small advantage of being Irish. I told him me mother had died. Me father's getting old. And me little sister-- oh, you want to see me little sister. She's wonderful. She's, um-- she's bravely struggling to keep things going. And she-- she wants us all home this year, because maybe it's the last Christmas we'd all spent together in the old home. It worked like magic. Almost swear when I finished, there were tears in the major's eyes. England won't go far wrong, Gregory, as long as men see like you do about the whole. Oh, Mick, you're oh, how could you? Why, what's wrong? It's all true, isn't it? Not a word of it's true. i don't feel like that a bit. Oh, I'm sorry. I supposed I'm being silly. I expect it's all right, really. Look, will you and David finish putting up the holly and [inaudible]. I finished it over here, see? Well, what's the matter with her? She's worried about your father, I think. He wasn't very well just now. No, and he never seems to be well these days. And what about this darn holly, eh? I don't know. We should get that up here on the chair. Right. [holly rustling] You go to that side of the room. I'll do this. Well, let's stick it behind the pictures, any way we can get it to stay. It's a strange thing, but I find all these Christmas decorations peculiarly depressing. Yes, it is depressing. I can't bear Christmas. I used to like it as a child, but now it's-- well, as you say, it's depressing. What's the matter with my father, do you know? He's been giddy for a moment, that's all. MICK: He ought to retire, you know. I gather he can't afford to. Oh, it's not that. He could, but he won't. I'm the trouble, really. Are you? Oh, he wants me to go to Cambridge, and that costs money. I'm not the type to get scholarships. Anyway, I've got a year to do in the Army first. That means at least four more years for him in this place. I don't want to kill him. So for me it's not worth it. Anyway, I'm not sure if I want to go to Cambridge. Oh, there's a lot of advantages to be had from a university education, you know? By me? No, no, I'm not the type. No use telling him that, though. You probably can't realize what it's like to have a parson as a father. If you're not careful, you get involved in a kind of perpetual pretense. Jenny seems to do all right. Jenny, oh, yeah. Margaret doesn't, though. Is that why she doesn't come home much these days? That's my guess. I can't think of any other reason. Come to think of it, Jenny's always just a special sort of person. If course, Margaret's remarkable, but Jenny's-- I know what you mean. Jenny's got a sort of natural magic. MICK: Hm. [doorbell ringing] That'll be the aunts. MICK: Oh. Will you let them in, Mick? MICK: Yes, of course. Oh, wait a second. Get rid of this holly. Put it in the hall. What about the ladder? Yes, put it away. You know where it goes. Sorry. [thump] [door opens] Siberia, it's like Siberia. Did you forget we were coming or what? Mick, dear, how nice to see you. I didn't think you'd be here. Let me take that. What do you hang around here for? I thought you'd be overseas be now? How nice you look in your uniform, Mick. Don't you think it suits him, Bridget? Jenny, darling! I prefer the Naval uniform, meself. Be careful with that one. There's breakables in it. It'll be $7.06, sir. Right. Oh, what a journey. We are frozen. We've been traveling across Russia, all those miles and miles of frozen land and government pine forests. And the heating in the carriage seemed to have jammed. Do you know it's exactly like I imagined Russia to be. No, wait, I want to look at you. You're tired, darling. You've been doing too much Hello, Aunt Bridget. How are you? Oh, I'm all right, thanks. Who's this? Oh, - I'm sorry, this is a friend of ours, David Paterson. How do you do? Oh, how do you do? That's a terrible habit not introducing people. Are you staying in the house or what? No, I just took a walk over, that's all. My people have a farm down the road. Come see your rooms. I expect you're tired. Oh, I'll just stay and thaw for a moment, darling. I'm frozen to the bone. Jenny, what are all those ducks doing walking about in the garden? Are they meant to be there? Oh, yes, they're all right. You don't eat ducks' eggs do you? Don't you know they're poison? A whole lot of people died in Lincolnshire the other day from eating ducks' eggs. It was all in the papers. Could you put them in the [inaudible]?? Oh, they're all right. We've used them for years. What am I going to do? I won't be [inaudible] thing. Isn't Jenny a darling? I'm so fond of her. She was so splendid all through my sister's illness. And now I think she's quite wonderful, the way she looks after her father. Don't you? Aye, she's wonderful all right, a bit too wonderful, if you ask me. Too wonderful? What do you mean? Well, in my opinion, carries self-sacrifice a bit too far. Oh, I see. Oh, I'm so glad, so very glad. You're in love with her, aren't you? No, no, no, no, don't tell me. There's no need. I can see it in your face. It's written all over you. Oh, I'm so glad, darling Jenny. You know, I was so afraid her being at home might mean-- Are you not rather jumping to conclusions? Well, I'm not wrong, am I? Don't tell me that I'm wrong. [chuckles] No, no, of course not. I'm never wrong about these things. I always know. Well, that must be a wee bit disconcerting for your friends. You're not offended, are you? No, but we haven't announced anything yet. The engagement's not been made public. Yes, but I'm not the public. Secrets of that sort are perfectly safe with me. Oh, I do congratulate you. Jenny is such a darling. This is right, absolutely right. You're cut out for each other. I can always tell. Oh, you're psychic or what? Oh, what a delicious Scottish voice. My husband was Scottish, you know, from Argyllshire. And ever since my marriage, I've always felt myself to be Scottish in a way. What part of Scotland do you come from? Not far from Aberdeen. And what do you do? I'm an engineer. Oh, I'm afraid that means nothing to me. I always said that engineering is a little inhuman, somehow. It's people that count. After all, it isn't petrol and oil that make the world go round, is it? [door closes] What am I going to do? Is there a train back to London? But Aunt Bridget, really, we've all eaten ducks' eggs for 20 years. That makes no difference. I don't see why I should be made to eat ducks' eggs if I don't want to. [horn honking] Hello, Richard. - Hello, Mick, how are you? - Let me take that. Thank you. Tell me, do you know [inaudible]?? Oh, wait up. Terrible, the way it does that. Brrr. Come in now. Brrr, it's cold. Jenny, my dear, how are you? Oh, this is Colonel Wyndham, David Paterson. How do you do, sir? How do you do? Where's Margaret? Oh, she's not coming. Not coming? Why not? Well, she's not feeling very well, a touch of flu, I think. So she thought she ought to stay put. Oh, dear. Daddy will be so disappointed. He's been so much looking forward to seeing her. Well, she sent you her love and wished you all a happy Christmas. Bridget. Well, I think I'll be getting along. All right, David. I'll take a walk over tomorrow sometime. Goodbye, David. [kiss] Good night, Jenny. [door opens, closes] Well, Bridget's still flying off the handle. I must be always [inaudible] at people like that. [laughs] Lydia, how's the headache? Headache? I haven't got a headache. Nonsense, you've always got a headache. Jenny, darling, he's charming, absolutely charming. Oh, I'm so glad. RICHARD WYNDHAM: Jenny, is that your boyfriend? Why didn't you tell me? I had no idea of that. Congratulations. What on earth do you mean. Aunt Lydia? What's David been telling you? He had no right to say anything. He didn't. I guessed. Somehow I always know these things. Darling, he's right for you, absolutely right. You know, Jenny, I always thought you'd never get married like meself. No, now listen, please, all of you. You're not to say a word about this to anyone. You understand? Not to anyone. Is he married already or what? In a month's time, David has to go abroad. He'll be away five years. Naturally, I want to go with him. But we can't be married until I can find someone who can come and look after Father. That's the way it was with me. There was I stuck looking after me mother till I was 45 and [inaudible]. In my opinion, parents have no right to batten on their children like that. [door closes] Well, now, I-- [chuckles] I'm sorry to be out when you came. How are you, Lydia? Martin, dear, how are you? Bridget, I'm sorry to be out. Well, Richard. Hello, Martin. Plus Mick! Hi, Dad. I thought you couldn't get leave. He went-- RICHARD WYNDHAM: Just him. Well, now that's splendid, splendid. Where's Margaret? She's not coming, Daddy. Not coming? But I thought you were driving her down, Richard. She's got flu. Oh, that'll be awkward for her. Did you see her this morning? Yes. MARTIN GREGORY: Was she in bed? No, no, when I saw her, she was already dressed to come. But she wasn't feeling very well and thought perhaps she better not. Oh. Well, now, I think I'll just give her the ring and see how she is. No, I wouldn't do that if I were you. You wouldn't? Why not? Well, she's all by herself there. She might be asleep. [click] Well now, Richard, will you-- would you try one of these? Thank you, I will. What are they? There, now let's see what they call them. Romeo y Julietta, Tobacos sabinos superbos. Well, that should be all right, eh? [laughs] The only trouble is they may be a wee bit dry. One of my church wardens gave them to me two years ago. They got mislaid in my desk. Hm, that desk, we were excavating it the other day. You know we found over 1,000 old sermons in it? RICHARD WYNDHAM: Great Scot. Oh, it's not such a great number when you come to think of it. Morning and evening, every Sunday, that's 52 Sundays in the year. You get through over 1,000 in 10 years. You know, since I was ordained, I must have written enough sermons to fill 150 books. And I doubt if anyone's paid the slightest attention to one of them. Martin, dear, I'm sure they have. I shall always remember one you preached soon after my Philip died. "And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, these are they whom the Lord have sent to walk to and fro through the earth." [sighs] I shall always remember that because of the myrtle trees. I was desperately unhappy. It was such a help to me. Well, I'm glad, my dear. I'm glad. Now Richard, how's it going? [door opens] MARTIN GREGORY: [inaudible] RICHARD WYNDHAM: Oh, yes, he must've looked [inaudible].. You know, he's in Dublin. He came over at about the same time that I did. [indistinct chatter] He had an idea to do well and bring over extra horses and hire them to [inaudible] MARTIN GREGORY: [chuckles] [drink pouring] RICHARD WYNDHAM: Cease the opportunity. You had always had a flare, Martin, for business. [indistinct chatter] [door opens] Margaret, what on earth are you doing here? I've just been telling him some darn story about your having flu. And then as soon as you were gone, I couldn't stand it alone in the flat. Oh, dear [inaudible]. When I came in here just now and saw this room again, I heard them all talking in there. Suddenly, I felt I couldn't stand this either. Well, what on earth do you want? I don't know. That's the trouble. Come on, pull yourself together. All right, I'll go up to my room first. [door opens] Margaret. Yes, it's me. Look who's here. Who? BRIDGET: My child, I'm delighted to see you. Oh, Margaret, what a pleasant surprise. Come and sit down. - Let me take your coat. JENNY: Have you had anything to eat? Yes. How-- how you feeling now Margaret? Wouldn't you-- wouldn't you be better in bed? I don't think so. Well, I guess it wasn't flu after all. Oh, but you're looking a bit pale, you know. You-- you've been overworking, that's what it is. Are you cold? A little. It's a cold night. You better take a glass of whiskey. Ah, now Jenny, we forgot all about it. Richard never had any whisky with his dinner. We-- we got this out especially for you. RICHARD WYNDHAM: That's all right, Martin. Here you are now, my dear. No, thank you, Father. Oh, come now, Margaret, it won't do any harm. Drink it up. It'll do you good. Didn't you hear me say, no, thank you? And she's refusing whiskey. Here, let me have it. I'll drink it. Thank you. How bitter the holly smells. Holly? I didn't know it had a smell. Yes, In the stalks when you break it. You know, it's in the cattle, bitter as any gall. "And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ for to redeem us all." I always think Christmas is the loveliest of the festivals. You know I hate it? LYDIA: Martin, why? Ah, the brewers and the retail traders have got hold of it. It's all eating and drinking and giving each other knickknacks. Nobody remembers the birth of Christ. But Christmas morning-- there's something about Christmas morning. In a vicarage, with services at 6 o'clock onwards. There's not morning at all. No, but the first moment when you wake up . Somehow, I don't know why I always know it's Christmas morning. It's as if during the night while you were asleep something had happened. You even expect the world to look as different as it feels. And you lie there, taking it in and realizing. And it seems strangest of all that it's Christmas everywhere. Of all the sermons in the year, the one on Christmas morning I dislike. Nobody wants to hear you. They're all fidgeting in their pews, longing to be back home basting the Christmas goose. There's no time to be telling them anything, anything important. Ah, for all that, I must write mine for the morning. Your coffee, darling. Hm? There'll be all evening, [inaudible]?? No. Ah. Well, I'm just going to get on with the washing up. No, not tonight, darling, you're tired. Stay here in the warmth. Can I be of any help JENNY: No, thank you, Auntie dear, you stay here. You can't go on leaving everything like this to your sister. Look at all she does, running this great house without any help and cooking all the meals. Generous, mind that. She's the domestic type. What type do you consider yourself? One regards oneself as an individual, Aunt Bridget. Types are the people. [door opens] The aunts say you're fed up with being at home. [plates clatter] That's not true, is it? Why shouldn't it be true? Then it is. You are fed up. Well, no, not exactly. Of course, it's a preposterously inconvenient house. But I always thought you liked being here. So I do very much in a way, but it's a bit limiting, particularly when-- oh, we can't talk about it. I'll tell you later. What is all this? It's perfectly simple. I-- I want to get married, that's all. Oh, darling, who? Anyone I know? He's called David Paterson. He's an engineer. I expect you'd think him very dowd. Why should I? Oh, I don't know. What's it matter anyway? Point is, he's got a job in South America. He sails in a month's time, and naturally, I want to go with him. - And what's to prevent you? And who's to look after Daddy? How can I leave him with just anyone? Because I know the ideal solution for him. What? With you. Margaret, couldn't you come home for a little while? You're such a special person to him. It would make all the difference. I'm sorry. That's out of the question. [plates clatter] You say it so immediately. Pick, like that. It's done with. Life has to be very easy for people like you. It's always easier than people like you make it. You have grown hard, haven't you? How'd this happen to you? You've changed. You never used to be like this. You must know you've changed. Of course, what do you expect? Life does change people. Why do you never come home? Now after Mother died, I made sure you'd try. Because I don't belong here anymore, as you say. I've changed. Maggie, you're not happy, are you? Who is? JENNY: Oh, plenty of people. Perhaps if they're stupid enough. Why must you always crackle like ice? What's happened to make you seem all frozen over inside? You're like someone out of a Hans Anderson story, the frozen queen who went down to the gardens of the dead. What has happened? Oh, do tell me. All right, I'll tell you. You remember Bob? Your American? My American, yes. But I thought he was killed right back in the middle of the war. Yes, he was killed, quite killed. I loved him very much. They-- they found his body, what was left of it. Oh, darling, you should have come home for a bit. You needn't have even have told us anything about it. But you should've come. I was pregnant. It was all rather difficult. I didn't quite know what to do. It was just about then that Mother was ill for the first time. You remember? I couldn't very well tell anyone. You could have told me. Yes, I suppose I could. I didn't see too much point in that. Luckily, I was away in London at the time. So I thought I'd better get on with it by myself. How awful for you. Oh, no it wasn't too bad once I'd made up my mind. But darling, what happened? Were you all right? Yes, quite all right. It was a boy. I called him Simon. I don't know why. If only I'd known. Of course, I see it all now. But it was a-- it was a bit of a problem at first. That's why I went to live with Sally and Christopher in Highgate. They had a nanny for the twins. She looked after Simon as well. It left me free to get a job in the daytime. Well, now you see why I never wanted to stay very long when I did come home. I was always wanting to get back to Simon. Yes, of course. Oh, Mag, darling, it's wonderful. I'm dying to see him. How old is he now? He would've been five last September. Would have been? He died last year of meningitis. Oh. (CRYING) Well, there it is. Now you know. Meningitis? And he was under four? When I was in hospital, I heard a child once. Well, how unpleasant for you. But Margaret, darling, I don't quite understand. Simon was the reason for your not coming home, but now there's no reason left you. Of course, there is. I couldn't stand the pretense. Why [inaudible]? Oh, because Father thinks that I'm someone I no longer am. Does it make so much difference? Well-- well, nothing's left the same. It's-- well, it's-- it's not numbness. It's not despair. It's a-- it's a sort of clarity. [chuckles] Not like yours, though. Of course, a bit, I don't feel or think as I used to about anything, even little ordinary things, like Christmas decorations and holly. Oh, don't you see, if I came back and lived with Father, I should [inaudible] all the time, pretending to be like I used to be. No, it would be an impossible, unbearable situation. The only solution would be to tell him. I couldn't do that, could I? Couldn't you? No. No, I suppose you couldn't. At least-- no, I don't really see how you could without upsetting him. Exactly. That's the trouble. He'd see it as a moral issue, but I don't. Yeah. Besides, the whole thing's over and done with now. Over and done with? What nonsense that is. Yes. You think so? Just at the moment, Yes. [inaudible] [music - "good king wenceslas] (SINGING) Hither page and stand by me, if thou knowest in telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Sire, he lives a good league hence underneath the mountain, right against the forest fence, by St. Agnes' fountain. Bring me flesh and bring me wine, bring me pine logs hither. Thou and I will see him dine when we bear them thither. Page and monarch forth they went, forth they went together, through the rude wind's wild lament and the bitter weather. Sire, the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger. Fails my heart-- I've just been telling Jenny. About Simon? How did she take it? Very well. There's a lot to be said for Jenny. Margaret, you must leave that alone. We have to get through the evening somehow. Yes, but not that way. How else? Well, if you're going to start drinking, you much better have stayed in London. I'm sorry. I suppose I'm being rather a bore. [chuckles] Well, you are, rather. And that's the trouble with drunks. They are bores. I'm not a drunk. Well, you're well on the way to becoming one. Oh, nonsense, Richard. Don't be silly. All right, perhaps not just yet. But how many times in the last two years have you gone home really sober, having spent the evening drinking with people who bore you to tears? Why? You know perfectly well why. Why do you bother about me? [sighs] I have to. I'm your godfather. [chuckles] How strange you are. I believe you take this godfather business quite seriously. Well, why not? I wonder why my parents ever chose you to be a godfather. You don't even believe in God, or do you? What's it matter to you what I believe in? It does matter. Why? Because I think perhaps what you can believe in, I could believe in too. Tell me, seriously, do you believe in God? No. I thought not, uh-huh. There it is. [door swings open] I'd say we're in for a jolly evening, two hours of cozy yuletide. Can't you feel it closing in on us? Mick, let's get out of here. Let's go to the pictures. OK, suits me. Come on, then, quick. If you miss the beginning, I don't suppose the film will be any good anyway. Never mind, escape, the foundation of all entertainment. [chuckles] [inaudible] it's a flea bit. MARGARET: [chuckles] [door closes] I'm frozen to the bone in this house. We've been talking about you and your dear David. Come by the fire, Aunt Bridget and keep warm. No, thank you. I'll sit away from the fire. I don't want to suffer meself. Listen, darling, we've been over it all most carefully. And we've come to the conclusion that there's only one solution. What's that Aunt Bridget? Your father ought to retire. Well, I don't know what they'll make of it all, I'm sure. But I'm going to tell them something about the ancient origins of their Christian customs. Ah, very interesting. You know why you put holly on the walls of Christmas? Something to do with the Druids, isn't it? No, that's the mistletoe. It goes right back to the old nature worship, the struggle between the holly and the ivy. There's a lot about it here in this book. The holly was the young man, and the ivy was the girls. It was the struggle between them as to who should rule the house. I know who rules in this house. Come and sit down, darling, her in the warm. Where are the other two? They've gone out. On Christmas Eve? Gone out? They've gone for pictures. To the pictures? I didn't know there was anything interesting on. [pages turning] How quiet it is. It's the snow, Aunt Lydia. It muffles everything. [laughing] What's the joke, Martin? Oh, it was just something that tickled me here, that's all. In the Middle Ages, they had a Feast of Fools at Christmas. It seems they got a bit rowdy at times. And in 1444, the cathedral chapter of sins laid down a regulation that "not more than three buckets of water could be thrown over a curate at vespers." [laughing] But Martin, why do they do all these extraordinary things at Christmas? Well, nobody knows why. One theory is it goes back to the days when they were making the calendar. They put even the extra days between the lunar and the solar year. And when they put them in, they felt they were queer sort of days that didn't really exist, days on which anything might happen. How strange. I used to feel rather like that about Christmas when I was a child. I remember how wonderful it was seeing the snow outside, finding our Christmas stockings, and all day long, a strange sort of excitement. And then in the evening, downstairs in the drawing room, dark green and glittering, the Christmas tree. Somehow Christmas never seems quite the same now. Ad one gets older, the magic seems to go out of things. [clock chimes] 10 o'clock. I'll put the kettle on. I expect the others will be back soon. I'll come and help you. Martin. Yes, Lydia, dear. Martin, dear, Bridget and I have been talking. And we can't help feeling that perhaps the time has really come when you ought to begin to think of retiring. Nonsense. I have several years ahead of me yet. Of course, you have, Martin, dear, that's just the point. Why not have them to yourself? What about my work? Or perhaps you don't think that's very important. I do. Of course, I do. And I know how splendid you are. You've given yourself completely to the people of this place. Don't you know, I doubt if half of them have the faintest conception of what I'm here for. They think I'm paid to marry them and bury them and sign their pension papers for them, just like a civil servant. I should have thought a little country town like this was just the sort of place where the parson still does have a great deal of influence. Well, you'd think so, wouldn't you? And that's what I thought when I came. There's the church, a great 14th century church standing up there in the middle of the town. It's the center of the place, architecturally. It should be the center of the place spiritually too. But it's not, no. A little tin pot shack of a cinema they've gone to tonight has more influence on the lives of people here than the church. I think the clergy have no one but themselves to blame. They're a lazy lot. Oh, but you can't say that about Martin. No one could have worked harder. Martin, dear, you deserve a rest. You can't go on forever. Oh, nonsense, I'd be nothing without me work. But you have so many interests. Look how you enjoy poking in your old books. [scoffs] Poking in old books wouldn't be enough to make sense of me life. It's kind of you to bother about me, but I-- I'd rather carry on while I can. That's all very fine and large. You've not only yourself to think about. There's Jenny too. Jenny? What's Jenny to do with it? It's no life for a girl to be stuck away here looking after an old man. It's time she got away and led a life of her own. She's perfectly free to go if she wants to. Yes, but Martin, is she? Jenny. Jenny, what's this your Aunt Bridget's been saying? You're feeling that you want to get away from here? Oh, Aunt Bridget, really? We've only been trying to persuade your father he ought to retire. Oh, it's no use talking about that. But tell me, Jenny-- [door closes] You're just in time for tea. MARTIN GREGORY: Ah, come and sit down, Margaret. LYDIA: Come and get warm, you look frozen. BRIDGET: Some people put films before family, I see. Come here in the warm now, no nonsense. Well, Richard, had a cozy evening? Your gardens of the dead are here tonight with a vengeance, Jenny. It's like walking over the surface of the moon. The snow is too pale. [thud] Jenny, lend me a hand. RICHARD WYNDHAM: Oh. Oh, she should never have gone out in the cold like that. Before where we know where we are, that flu of hers will be turning to pleurisy. She's drunk, Martin. That's what it is. She's drunk. MICK: (SINGING DRUNKENLY) The holly and the ivy, when they are both full grown, of all the [inaudible] that are in the wood, the holly bears a crown. We just passed the carol singers over at David, uh-- what's his name, David? You know, Jenny's boyfriend? And go on, Bridget. Had a nice evening. Disgusting. Ugh. Good night, Martin, dear. Oh, good night. Good night. A rather good bit of luck. I saw rather a good film. "Nanook of the North," all about Eskimos. Of course, it's old, but it was really very-- You've not been near the cinema. Why don't you tell the truth? The truth? You can't be told the truth. That's the trouble. That's the whole trouble. You can't be told the truth! You'll better go to bed, Michael. [children singing carols] [knock at door] Hey, better give them something. It's all right, Father, I've got a shilling here. Oh, Jenny, Jenny. What would I do without you? [singing continues] You'll never have to, Father. [bells jingling] [singing continues] JENNY: Happy Christmas, Richard. Happy Christmas, Jenny. Would you like some coffee? I'm just going to make some. No, I don't think I've got time before the train. What train? You don't say Aunt Bridget's going? Bridget? No, no, Margaret. Oh, she mustn't. Or perhaps it's best. Richard, what about this drinking of hers? It was frightening last night. Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about last night, if I were you, Jenny. It was exceptional. There were special circumstances. Coming home at all was a bit of a strain for her. She only drinks because she's unhappy. And it's not only her grief. It's-- it's because she's askew with the world. Maybe, but her-- her askewness, as you call it, well, that's considerably worse than her drinking. If she got that straight, she'd be perfectly all right. Of course, London's the worst place for her. Mm. I wish she wasn't going home to that [inaudible] by herself. [sobbing] [spoon clanging] Seen my father this morning? No, not yet. [sighs] Probably because the old makes such a darn fuss about everything. Who do? People like my parents, religious people. Mother was just the same. Any conversation goes right back to the creation of the world and beyond. Well, take a thing like last night. All right, I was tied. I admit it. I was darn silly in front of the aunts and all. Anybody'd have the right to be a bit annoyed about it. But it was only a [inaudible]. I mean, a stockbroker or someone would just-- just take you off and that'd be an end to it. For the parson, the whole thing is quite different. He may not be angry. He may not even say anything, to be what Jenny calls upset, which is worse. Well, I'm just going to try and start the car. Margaret's going. I said I'd take her to the station. I don't blame her. If I had two pence, I'd go myself. It's going to be awful here today. [chuckles] Cheer up, Mick, ol' boy, in a 100 years, we'll all be dead. Just look at the sun on the snow. It's heavenly. We might always be in luck land or somewhere. I'm not going to stay here after what happened last night. Bridget, you're not going. I am. Oh, but it's so wrong to take out this attitude. I do feel it's so wrong. We ought to try to be more tolerant. I don't see the point of tolerating low habits. Anyway, you ought to stay if only for Jenny's sake. She's taken so much trouble with all these wonderful preparations. No really, I think it most unkind of you to go off like this. Oh, well, I-- I didn't mean it that way at all. I know you didn't, Aunt Bridget. You'll miss the goose if you go now. Goose is it you're having, not turkey? Oh, dear, don't you like goose? I do. I prefer it. Now I don't want it. JENNY: Then stay on, Bridget. Please do stay. Very well, then, I will. I'm going now to get ready for church. Aunt Bridget, Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas. [door opens] Jenny. [door closes] Jenny. Oh, hello, Mick. Do you know where Jenny is? Oh, she's in the kitchen. I think I'll-- I'll fetch her. No, no, just-- just tell her I-- I'm ready for my coffee, would you? She's-- she's making it now, I think. Oh, good. Hm. [inaudible] Father? Yes. I'm, uh-- I'm sorry about last night. Oh, well, can't be held now. There it is. Tell me, do you-- do you often take too much to drink? Not often, no, of course not. It has happened before, though, has it? Well, yes, I, um, have been tied once or twice. MARTIN GREGORY: I suppose you think nothing of it. I suppose it is a bit silly. It all depends how tied you get, really. MARTIN GREGORY: Does it? It does not. That's a superficial way of looking at things, the rightness or wrongness of anything you do depends on what you think life is for. Have you ever thought of it that way? Oh. I'm sorry. Here's your coffee, darling. Drink it while it's hot. Oh, thank you, Jenny. Mick's having some too. I'll come and help you with all the washing up. No, no, finish your coffee first. Well, someone just spoiled your Christmas for you. Says it was only an accident about last night. Truly, you might have seen to it you didn't make your sister drunk. I made her drunk? Was it my fault? You're not suggesting it was hers, are you? And it wasn't mine. I didn't even know she meant to go to the pub. Oh, don't start making excuses. What's the matter who thought of it first? That's a contemptible thing to say. Well, it's true. I suppose you're of age to be responsible for your own actions. Aren't you ashamed to stand there and tell me it was your sister who made you drunk? Well, the truth is-- oh, all right, have it your own way. Now look here, Michael, I hadn't meant to say anything about this, but there's something else that's been bothering me. I don't suppose you were too drunk to know what you were saying last night? No, I wasn't. I asked you why you didn't tell the truth. Do you remember what you said then? Yes, I remember. You said that I couldn't be told the truth, didn't you? - Yes. - What did you mean by that? Oh, I don't know-- No, Michael, I want to know. What did you mean when you said I couldn't be told the truth? Well, I meant exactly what I said. You can't be told the truth, at least not by us, not by Jenny and Margaret and me. The real facts about us would hurt you too much, so we lie to you. At least if we don't lie, we conceal the truth from you. The whole situation in this house is built on lies and concealment. Situation in this house? Well, look what happened just now. I was trying to tell you about last night, what happened to Margaret, but you wouldn't listen, because I understand very well, of course, what you mean about responsibility. The plain fact is she drinks! [church bells ringing] There, you see, it does upset you. Can you blame us for trying to conceal that sort of thing? How long have you known this? Since last night, it's just one of the few things I did find out last night. Of course, there have always been things you couldn't be told. I didn't realize how far it had gone, when it's a question of Jenny's [inaudible] her whole life. Jenny? Jenny? What's Jenny to do with it? I heard that Jenny wants to get married to David Paterson. Well, does she now? Well, I'm glad it was my own idea. I thought nothing was coming of it. But the way she felt, she ought not to unless Margaret could come here and be with you. There's no need for her to feel that. I don't want anyone to feel obliged to be here with me. But why did she refuse? Why? Not because she didn't want to, but because she couldn't face settling down here to a life of false pretenses. And then she felt she couldn't tell you the truth. The truth? The truth? What truth? The truth about herself. I didn't know till last night, and neither did Jenny. That's all part of the same thing. She could have told us both quite easily years ago. But she didn't want to put us in the position of deceiving you all the times. So she had to go through the whole thing alone. That's how she gotten to this terrible state. Will you stop ranting and tell me what all this is about? Well, during the war, she had an affair with an American airman. It was serious. I mean, she was in love with him. He was killed. And after he was killed, she found she was going to have a child. I see. Well, don't you see how impossible it would be to tell you a thing like that? Impossible? Why impossible? - Why? Isn't it obvious? You're a parson. You'd be shocked. You're bountily shocked. What, you think because I'm a parson, I know nothing about life? Why do you think I was ordained in the first place? You think it was because I was so easily shocked that I couldn't face realities? No, of course not. As a parson, you have a different attitude to life. You think a thing like this that's happened to Margaret is wrong. And what's more, you would expect everybody else to feel the same way. Well, don't you see? How can parsons expect to be told the truth? A man can't even talk to them like ordinary human beings. Well, if that's the way I've made you all feel, I've failed. I've failed completely. Oh, heck. [church bells ringing] Poor Jenny, I'm afraid you're going to have a trying day. But I'm glad you persuaded Richard to stay. It was not easy. Oh, well, that comes with living alone. Hasn't made you difficult, Aunt Lydia. Oh, well it's different for me. There's been someone in my life. I haven't always been alone. It's strange how our life only seems to have meaning because of someone else. You understand that, Jenny. You're in love. Yeah, and Aunt Lydia, that's all over. We can't get married. I realized it quite clearly last night. Oh, darling, no, that's such a mistake. When you're in love, you mustn't let anything stand in the way. Isn't that sentimental, Aunt Lydia? Marriage isn't the only thing in the world. LYDIA: It's a very important one. Don't you think people exaggerate its importance? No. I'm 70, Jenny. I've seen quite a lot of the world. I know what I'm talking about. Everyone needs someone else. Loneliness is a terrible thing. It can do appalling things to one. That's why I'm always so sorry for people like Bridget. She did what you're thinking of doing. She stayed at home to look after your grandmother. I think she was quite right to do that. Perhaps. But think what it has meant. Ever since your grandmother died, Bridget has been quite alone. If she died tomorrow, it wouldn't really make the slightest difference to anyone. That's why it means so much to her to be here with you all for Christmas. [church bells ringing] Oh, Margaret, oh, you're-- you're going, are you? Oh, well, perhaps it's better so. Uh, one-- one minute, though, before you go. I-- I want you to know that-- that I know. Michael's just told me. I can see that you would feel the way that you do about it, but I-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Margaret. I-- I've been no use to you, no use at all. Well, never mind. I managed all right. Yes, but that's just what hurts me, that you felt that you had to manage alone, and that you've gone on feeling it all these years. Oh, it's a terrible thing. Tell me, has it always been the same? When you were children, did you feel the same way then? Michael tells me that you-- all of you have always been afraid to speak freely before me. Well, not for any personal reason, only because of religion. Because of religion. A fine caricature I've made of religion if that's how it seems to me own children. It should be because of my religion I have more sympathy and understanding for people. But I have, Margaret, I have. I've seen the kind of men that turn away from the sorrows of his own children. And if I do, it's no wonder me works had so little effect all these years. I-- I've been distorting and misrepresenting religion all my life without knowing it. I can't believe it. Oh, well, it's too late now. If that's how you feel, you'd better go. You'll be happier in London. Happy? Well, at least you'll have your child. Didn't they tell you? He's dead. Oh, Margaret. No, no, please. It's all over and done with now. But at least your-- your friends and your work will be of some comfort to you. Friends? My friends are anyone who wants another drink. Oh, I've often thought how much I'd rather be here. But, of course, it wouldn't work. I can see that. I'm out all day scribbling smart, highly paid nonsense. It earns the rent of a wonderful flat that I can't bear to stay in alone for five minutes when I get back in the evening. What makes no sense. [sighs] But why should it after all? Well, because it all makes no sense. You mean it makes no sense to you. No, not only to me, to everyone. Only most people don't notice it. I've been made more aware of it, that's all, because of what happened. You mustn't let it make you bitter. I'm not bitter. This has nothing to do with my personal feelings at all. It's something I've seen, why just as you suddenly see the solution of a mathematical problem. And this isn't the solution. Aren't you deceiving yourself when you say that it's nothing to do with feeling? I don't think so. Well, it began with feeling, of course. But feeling soon exhausts itself. You can't feel even grief forever. But grief leaves an emptiness. There's always a blankness. Yes, I know. But it's not that. It's something far bigger than that. It's as though in that blankness, I've suddenly stumbled on something that affects everyone, everyone in the world. Well, listen, when Robert was killed, I really did love him, you know. And after that, I found out I was going to have Simon. Well now, that seemed important, because-- not only because of Robert. But another life in the world is important. So for the next four years, I did everything I possibly could for Simon. Well, then he died. And I just felt, well-- well, what was the point of it all? What was the value of all that effort? Don't you see? It was then that I first began to realize that in the end. It's the same for everyone. Practically all the efforts that people make are simply to keep life going, whether their own or somebody else's. And the whole thing's doomed to failure. We know that. Life can't be kept going indefinitely. With the sun's growing cold, in the end, the human race will be frozen off the Earth. What sense does that make? Oh, I know. I know what you'll say about God and immortality and so on. But I just can't believe in that. No, how can you understand? You're a parson. Yes, I am. It was thoughts like yours that I had when I was a young man that first made me think of being ordained. I never could be certain from one moment to the other what I believed about anything. I'm not interested in faith. I don't want to comfort myself with fairy stories. Fairy stories? Oh, I'll not have you say that. You know, that's the trouble with your generation. You must see and touch before you can believe. Well, can you touch the wind? St. Augustine said that. Oh, you're clever. You're intelligent. But you frighten yourself with words. Ah, people don't know what they want half the time, more money, they think, or more power or just another drink, perhaps, or another wife or another lover. Ah, but it's none of these things, because even when they have them, there's still something they want. And they don't know what it is. And they go on wanting something and not knowing what it is. And that is the root of all the religions in the world. But you must face life, you know, Margaret. Grapple with it, not turn your back on it before you can make sense of it all. Why do you think I became a parson in the first place? Because I saw what life was like, not because I didn't. And yet, Mick comes in here and has the impudence to tell me that I can't be told about you because I'm a parson. And you tell me that I can't understand your need, because I'm a parson, too, I suppose. It's insufferable nonsense. Oh, bother, I hadn't meant to say a word. But why didn't Jenny tell me that she wanted to get married? Ah, so you've woken up to the truth at last. What, did you know about this? Did you know Jenny wanted to get married? I did. And I hope you've been telling Margaret where her duty lies. You leave Margaret out of this. You're a foolish old woman, Bridget, always with a chip on your shoulder, always up against somebody. If you hadn't been so cantankerous all your life, Jenny could have asked you to come her and keep house for me, instead of spending all your life pampering that fat cat of yours. You'll be cruel to a cat, I suppose. I believe cats have souls. [church bells ringing] Ah, listen, the full [inaudible].. Ah, what an absurd world it is. The Christmas bells, peace on Earth, goodwill towards men. And here I've been losing my temper and shouting at you. I beg your pardon, Bridget. [kiss] I must be off at once. Where-- where's me coat? It's here. I'll get it. Ah, and me beastly galoshes. Here it is. Is there anything else you want? No, no, yes, yes, it's, um, over there. Jenny makes me wear these for the snow. But I can't be seen in church in them. Here, put one in each pocket. What a wonderful idea. Are you sure you've got everything you want? Yes, yes, thanks. You know, I'm sorry to be rushing off like this. That's all right. She sent me. Ah, thank you, Margaret. [kiss] You know, this-- this talk we've had, there's been truth in it. If not in the words, then between the words or between us. And that's why I'm grateful to you, because it's not often I have a real talk with anyone. [kiss] [door opens] Uh, no. [door closes] [gate closes] [church bells ringing] Happy Christmas. If you're half a man, you'll take Jenny out of this double-quick. Out of what? Disgusting. I don't care to talk about it. Happy Christmas. Oh, my poor David, I am so sorry for you. What is all this gloom about? Well, but hasn't Jenny told you? It's been dreadful, quite dreadful. The most appalling things have happened since you were here yesterday. Yes, but what? That's what I want to know. What has happened? I haven't time. I'm going to church, but it's disastrous, absolutely disastrous. Mick, can you tell me what's been happening? Yeah, there's just been an atomic explosion. Since last night, the whole of our lives have been split open, exposed. This morning, everybody's stumbling about among the debris. Oh, the place is radioactive. I must go. Wait, have you got a sixpence? - What for? - The collection. Jenny will pay you back out of the housekeeping. All right. Goodbye. Good morning. Good morning. You'll be Margaret, I suppose. Look here, I have a bone to pick with you. What's all this about you refusing to come home? But I am coming home. You are? There now, I said you would. Did you? I told Jenny yesterday. I couldn't believe it when she said you wouldn't. I wonder why she thought I wouldn't. I don't know, she said you just wouldn't, that's all. She said you weren't that sort of a person. I thought it was monstrous. You remind me of my own Bridget. You seem to have very explosive views about people. Oh, I just see things clearly. That's all. Well, be careful you don't see them too clearly. Hey, what are you getting at? I can't make head or tail of anyone in this house this morning. What's the matter with you all? It's Christmas, the family festival. We've all learned a thing or two about each other, that's all. Oh, I haven't the time to see Jenny. You must tell her. Perhaps it would be better for you to tell her anyway. Say that I've had some talk with my father, and everything's quite all right. That last bit's the most important. She'll know what it means. DAVID PATERSON: Don't worry, she'll know what it means, all right. - Pack up, Margaret. - I'm not going to London. - You're not going? I'm going to church. But I've just started-- It's Christmas. Come on, you old heathen. Oh, happy Christmas. Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas. Jenny. [clatter] Jenny. Coming. [church bells ringing] Oh. [door swings open] Oh, David! David, I'm so late. Jenny, Margaret's coming home. Oh, she mustn't. Mustn't? You mean you've changed your mind? No, but-- What does this mean then? She just this moment told me to tell you she's had some talk with your father, and it's quite all right. Well? Oh, that's wonderful. (CRYING) It won't be easy, of course, but it's everything. Jenny, what's the matter? What are you crying for? [sobbing] (CHUCKLING) I think you're mad, stark, staring, raving mad. - (SOBBING) Yes. [chuckles] [MUSIC - "O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL"] CONGREGATION: (SINGING) O, come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant-- [theme music]
