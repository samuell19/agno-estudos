Sometimes god lets me know the question. Sometimes he lets me know the answer. Sometimes I get the question and the answer at the same time, but not necessarily in that order. And they chase each other around in my head like two cats fighting in the alley. I gave you a brain, Bernie-- use it. Think. It's a little game we play. But to give Shirley and me and poor little felice what he gave US to think about made me wonder, "does he play by the same rules that you and I would think were fair?" Well, you be the judge. The lenses you shipped are unacceptable, not to mention inferior. Now I am not about to impose that kind of... Morning, daddy dear. Good morning, sweetheart. Look, I don't wanna argue. Watch! ( Makes airplane noise ) Felice, roller skates were meant for the outside, darling. I was saying I'm not about to impose substandard anything on my patients. Now, ship the quality I ordered promptly, or I'll do business elsewhere. All right. Bye bye. Sweetheart, daddy told you that you shouldn't be skating you shouldn't be skating in the living room, my darling. Not...nah nah. ( Laughs ) You're skating on the rug as well as on the floor, and your mother will have both our heads. Felice, stand right there. Don't move. Daddy would never double cross his beautiful precious daughter. ( Laughing ) Just keep moving, felice. I'm telling you, your mother is going to give it to both of US. You're going over the couch-- Bernie, the sofa! What are you, crazy? I'll handle it. Sweetheart-- what are letting her skate in the house for? We just had the floors refinished. Look, you two, this is not a playground. See. You all right, baby? Is she all right? She's fine. Mommy, I'm fine. Then get the skates off, and let's get ready for school. I'm gonna be late again, you know. I'm getting my coat. I don't see why I can't walk five blocks by myself. I mean, I'm 12 years old. What's this whole bar mitzvah thing if it doesn't get me this humongous right to walk to school by myself. Dad, I'm going to be late. I hear ya, I hear ya. Upstairs. Mothers. You know how they are. She likes to walk her children to school. It's a tradition. In what? Being late? Are you memorized yet? Memorized? The rabbi only gave me the haftarah portion last week. I was hoping. Go ahead, I'll handle her. Thanks, pop. Bernie: Better or worse? Better. Better or worse? Uh, better. Read the bottom line. "E," no. "L." "b..." Just as I suspected. Now wonder you don't have a net game anymore. Well, I knew it was something wrong. All right, let's put it this way, Bob. You don't have any cataracts. No glaucoma. No hemorrhaging. No detached retina. So? What's wrong with me? You just don't see so good. ( Both laugh ) Come on, Bob. After you, father. Thank you. ( Both laugh ) Here you are, Dolores. Thank you. This way, father. Oh, thanks. We have a whole brand new line of beautiful frames. But I have to warn you-- be careful. The last man that selected one of these frames was attacked by three women. Yeah, well, thanks for the warning. But if you select the right frame, then all you're going to need is a new forehand, a new backhand, and a new tennis racket. New partner? Yes, but you will miss me. A lot. Give my best to Shirley. Will do. Mrs. Bienveniste, room two. Thank you. Shirley! Dad, up here! David, where's your mother? In the bedroom. It's felice. She fell. Everything's going to be all right, baby. You're gonna be fine. You did good, Shirley. When she hit the floor, she went into a convulsion. I swear, I thought she was gonna die. I'm scared. I know, baby. Don't worry. Everything is gonna be fine. Mommy and daddy are right here, and these people are gonna help you so you'll get all better really fast. Are you warm enough? ( Whines ) It's all right, baby. Are you felice's parents? Yes, we are. I'm nurse Thompson. I'll need to take a medical history. Could you tell US what they're doing to our daughter? She's being prepped for a few tests. What kind of tests? Dr. Dunlap will explain the procedures to you. In the meantime, I'll need to know your daughter's full name, her age... Bernie, I can't stand this. All right, easy, honey. Her name is felice Beth Abrams. She's six years old. Any history of seizures or mental illness in your family? No. All right, honey. Easy. Uh, I should have told you. Felice is adopted. But she's never been sick a day in her life. Certainly nothing ever like this. Nothing like this. Here are consent forms for you to sign. Thank you. Dr. and Mrs. Abrams? Yes. I'm Dr. Dunlap. Oh, how's our daughter, doctor? Mind stepping over here, please. The c.F.S. Was clear. There was no pleocytosis, the chemicals were normal. And the gram stain was negative. Doctor, what are you talking about? I'm sorry. I thought the chart said "Dr. Abrams." I am Dr. Abrams. I'm an optometrist. Oh, I see. Well, what I should tell you is that she's resting comfortably, and according to preliminary examinations, everything appears to be normal. Then why did she pass out like that? Oh, her fever was 103, and that probably induced the seizure. Oh, she was fine an hour ago. Which is why, to be on the safe side, we'd like to keep her in isolation ward overnight. Isolation? Why? It's just a precaution to rule out meningitis. Meningitis. It's a standard procedure. Go home, get some rest. ( Scoffs ) What are talking about, go home? I'm not leaving her. Mrs. Abrams, right now there's nothing you can do to help your daughter. And the unit isn't equipped for an overnight guest. I'm not an overnight guest. I'm her mother. It's against the rules. It's against your rules, maybe. By my rules, my baby does not stay in a hospital overnight without me. Shirley, you can sleep out here. You can't sleep in there. Maybe I won't sleep at all. Well... I'll see if the house staff can find you an extra cot. I knew there was a reason I hooked up with you. For the next 2 1/2 months, life was pretty good for the Abrams family. David prepared for his bar mitzvah. Felice, with the exception of some minor problems, went on enjoying her child's life. Shirley, as always, took care of US all. But things got so busy at the office that I had less time for my walks out here in the woods. I do my best thinking here. It's very peaceful. I feel close to god. So life was good. Everything was okay. Then it happened at a Friday night sabbath dinner and changed our lives forever. Why at a sabbath dinner? That's a question. ( All laugh ) Here, here's another one. Here's another one. A rabbi, a minister, and a priest are sitting on a very distinguished panel. You know, to discuss when life begins. So the priest stands up and says, "there's no doubt life begins at conception." Well, the minister raises his hand and said, "no, no, no, life begins at the moment of birth." Now, all eyes shift to the rabbi who looks all around and says, "I'm sorry, but I must differ with my colleagues "because it's the experience of my people that life only begins when the kids move out and the dog dies." ( Spits ) Oh... ( Laughs ) Oh... ( Laughs and coughs ) We should begin. Let's eat. Come on. Excuse me. After you, Bob. Thank you. How's felice holding up? Oh, she blanks out from time to time, but she's on a new medication now. And the doctor thinks she's going to outgrow it. Oh, that's encouraging. Tell that to Shirley. We chose this for you, father, so you could feel like a cardinal. Yeah. St. Louis cardinal. Two vishnitz and you become shecky Greene. ( Laughs ) e.loi.henu, mi.Lech, ha.O.Lam, a.ta, de.Tsi.Vha.Nul, ma.alik, nher.Sher, ha.Shabat. Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom. ( Felice screams ) ( Shuddering ) Oh my god. Easy, easy. Easy. David, get the paramedics. Move it! Oh god, this is how it was before. I'm sorry, sir. You can't come in here. ( Patrons laughing ) It was too much for her. We should have cancelled the dinner. I don't understand why we can't go in there. Do you want some tea? Yeah, okay. I'll get it. ( Clears throat ) Can I help you? No, I got it. Thank you. Thank you. Now, listen... Here's the plan. I'm gonna find the best man I can in the city, and he's going to see her. And we're going to get some answers. And she's going to be just fine. And this is not just a fantasy wish. This is my promise to you. Okay? Notice that the nerve cell actively remains stable, but when the pattern gets disturbed we start seeing these steep spikes. And that's, uh, epilepsy? Well, I'd rather say those are the seizures. Let's sit down, shall we? You'll do better not to think of epilepsy as a disease but rather as a description of a series of neurological symptoms. They're different for every patient. Epilepsy is an excessive electrical activity in the brain. There are over 20 different types of seizures. For instance, there are "grand mal" seizures that affect all the motor functions, the uncontrolled muscle spasms and the dramatic convulsions. Then, there are "petit mal" seizures which are relatively mild and affect only a part of the brain. Now, they are more common. The patient will often experience only a momentary loss of consciousness. There are other types of seizures that don't even induce a convulsion and only show up on an e.E.G. Machine. Which type does felice have? Well, until we know more about the duration, the, uh... Intensity and the length of the seizure, it's--it's difficult to classify them. When can she go home? We can discharge her today if you like. Even though she's not 100%? As long as felice takes her medication, she can return to school and a normal routine but with caution of course, and she must have regular exercise. I would suggest a swimming regimen. Now the key is to have her take this medication on a regular basis. Now, there might be some side effects-- hyperactivity. Irritability. Nausea. The important thing is to keep her out of school for at least two weeks, see how she does. And, uh, keep me informed. ( Felice coughs ) Okay, sweetheart. Take it easy. ( Gagging ) Okay, breathe normal. ( Coughing ) Breathe. Let mommy wipe your face. All right. All right. Easy, sweetie. ( Coughing and gagging ) Good morning. First day back on the grind, precious face? Daddy, I don't feel good. Oh, but you look terrific, sweetheart. And two weeks out of school is long enough. Bernie, she is so doped up from this medicine. Look at her. Sometimes she can hardly stand up. How can we send her back to school? The doctor told US this was going to happen until we find the proper dosage. She has to go back to school, Shirley. It's important that we get her back on her own routine, and this day is as good as any. ( Knocking ) So glad you could make it, Dr. Abrams. ( Laughs ) Hey, what do you got there anyway? Your bill. And I'll be sending it directly to Mrs. Stabile. Would that be all right with you, Mrs. Stabile? If I can read it, I'll pay it. Hey, this is my office. I get to do the jokes. Dolores. Where have you been? The epilepsy foundation. You should have seen the look on the librarian's face when she asked what I wanted to read, and I said, "everything." What's wrong? Your wife phoned. Mm-hmm. Her teacher called from school. Felice was vomiting. I took her home, called Dr. Cavanaugh who prescribed something for the nausea. We drove to the pharmacy, and, while the druggist was filling the prescription, she went down. The shaking was worse than ever. Then she went rigid. Cold. I knew it was too soon to send her back to school. If we can't stop the seizures immediately, there could be some major complications. What does that mean? There could be some deterioration of her intellect. Deterioration? Yes. Possible retardation, and I'm afraid it... Might be permanent. No! How long before this happens? Well, there's really no way to tell, but we'll do everything in our power to prevent further injury by putting her on one of the strongest anti-- you're not answering my question! How long... Before the deterioration begins? A month. Four months, six months. There's no way we can know for certain. Dr. Cavanaugh... Is our little... Girl gonna die? It's possible. But retardation is the immediate danger if we can't stop the seizures. Well, then... We'll have to stop them. ( Dog barks ) David, what do you think? What is it? It's a padded helmet. Well, I know what it is, but what's it for? For your sister, in case she falls. It's purple. Yuck! That's her favorite color. Well, I guess she'll like it. Of course she will. What are you doing up so early? Well, I heard mom leaving for the hospital, so I thought I'd get up and say goodbye to her. Oh, okay. See ya later. Uh, dad? Yes? Uh, I was sorta having trouble with the first part of my haftarah portion, and I thought maybe we could go over it? Now? Couldn't we do it a little later, David? Like tonight? I really am in a rush, son. I need to drop this off at the hospital before going on to the office. Sure, that's no problem. On second thought, let me hear what you're working on. Really? Yeah, really. * a.Mi ai.O.Mar very good, David. But you're not doing "ai.O.A.Tha." This is "Isaiah," with strength and conviction. * a.Mi ai.O.Mar * e.Loi.E.Hem... Okay. Here we go. "A"..."b"... "C"...come on. "A"..."b"... "C"... "D"... I forgot, mommy. I forgot. Her eyes are puffy. Her speech is slurred. She's listless. She's dizzy. She's losing consciousness 15 to 20 times a day. Dr. Abrams, please try to calm yourself. Dr. Cavanaugh, do you have children? Yes. Then how the hell do you dare ask me to be calm? Because emotional displays won't help. It may not help, but it's also uncontrollable! It's a child! It's my baby! I care for her! Those are emotions! All right. Felice hasn't responded as... Quickly as we had hoped because she seems to be-- to have a cluster of different problems. You'll just have to show a little more Patience with US. Patience? Patience. My wife and I have been sitting around waiting patiently for three months while you prescribe drugs that don't work. And this morning, my beautiful, bright six year old forgot her abc's for god sakes! Now, if you can't come up with a diagnosis, or if you don't know how to stop these seizures, say so. But there has to be something. There must be something you can recommend that will help US. We're doing the best we can do, Dr. Abrams, and, if you are dissatisfied, you're free to get another opinion. Fine. How many more for today? Well, there's Mr. Binion. There's Mrs. Weeks, she's a new patient. And Mrs. Young. Cancel the day after binion. And if anybody needs me, I'll be in my office. Here, baby. Well well, I just happened down the hall, on my way to dinner, to realize this beautiful young lady would be wonderful to have dinner with, but I didn't realize there's a mother there. I should have checked. Do you mind? Not at all. Ah, what do you have to say, dear? Baby? Tell daddy what the nurses said about your helmet. They said it was pretty. Well, you know what you can tell your mommy? You can tell your mommy that daddy found an article written by a Dr. Whalley in england who's been using a new drug called sodium valproate to treat some kinds of seizures, and, from what he's written, it could very well help our little girl. We should talk to Dr. Cavanaugh. We don't need to talk to Dr. Cavanaugh. He's not our doctor anymore. We have an appointment with a world-class specialist, a real specialist. Another specialist? Oh, this is a top of the line specialist. This one is top of the line. I mean this is a heavyweight. Dr. Samuel Livingston. He's--he practices in Baltimore. Baltimore? I thought you said he was in england. No, that's the Dr. Whalley that wrote the article. We're going to see Livingston. I'm checking US out of here right now. What?! You just take care of felice. Everything's going to be perfect ber-- Oh, Dr. Abrams. I probably should have introduced myself earlier. I'm Dr. Earl sherrard. I run the clinic in neurology here on the ward. How do you do, doctor? I saw you the other day at the vending machine. I thought you were... A patient? I hope you don't mind my asking, doctor, but I've had the chance to observe your daughter during rounds. I wonder if anyone has spoken to you about putting her on a ketogenic diet? Uh, well actually, Dr. Sherrard, we are going to Baltimore tomorrow. We have an appointment with Dr. Samuel Livingston. Have you heard of him? Oh, you can't do better than him. Well, if we ever can be of any help to you, doctor, please don't hesitate to call me. Good luck to you, sir. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Bernie: No, it's not nabrams, it's Abrams. A-b-r-a-m-s. A-m-s. ( TV noises ) Yes, and if you could have Dr. Whalley call me back, I'd appreciate it. I can be reached in Baltimore. Area code 3-1-1. The number's 5-5-5, 4-8-8-5. But I would appreciate if you could try to call me back today. I'd be very grateful. It's most important. Thank you. We come to Baltimore. We've just seen a specialist. Why are you looking for another one in england. ( Phone rings ) Because whalley wrote the article about sodium valproate, and I'm just trying to cover all our options, that's all. Hello? Oh, yes. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. All right, fine, I'll be right there. Who was that? Livingston's office. They have the test results. We believe that felice has contracted an extremely complex form of epilepsy. It's known as myoclonic. It's very rare. Very debilitating. You most often see it in children. And, unfortunately, it doesn't usually respond well to medication. On a more positive note, felice's brain capacity hasn't been diminished permanently. Thank god for that. Yes. That's something we can be grateful for. Dr. Livingston, isn't there anything we can do. Well, we could pull her off her medication. Try putting her on a ketogenic diet. What about sodium valproate? I read about that in a British medical journal. Well, I don't personally have any hands-on experience with the drug. It hasn't been sufficiently tested here. Yes, but according to this article, it's been available in Europe for the last ten years, and it's been used, not tested, used for more than over 120,000 people. I said...Here, Dr. Abrams. It hasn't been sufficiently tested here. But if it were available here, could that help felice? Theoretically, yes. But if it were, would you prescribe the drug for her? No. I'm not qualified to determine what dosage to prescribe. I wouldn't know how to measure it's toxicity. Well, who is qualified? Only the specialist making the test. Until those tests are completed and the food and drug administration is satisfied that the drug is safe and effective, it cannot be distributed. That takes time. How can I get some? I'm sorry. I can't help you. I didn't ask you to help me. I asked you how I can get some. It is not legally available. How can I get some? It's illegal. I don't know any other way to say this to you. I cannot help you get that drug. This is Dr. Bernard Abrams in the United States. Yes, the same one. I have left message after message for Dr. Whalley, and either he is not getting the messages, or he just doesn't care to call me back. No, no. I know. I know it's not your fault. No, I know you are not to blame. I just need you to tell the doctor I've called again. Please, it's urgent. Thank you. ( Exhales ) Out. You okay, Bernie? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine. Let's go. Let's stay with it, pal. Okay? Bernie's ready. Out! Out? Come on, Bernie, that thing hit the line. Well, it looked wide to me. Why don't we take it over? Oh no, a call's a call. Yeah, and a lousy call's a lousy call. Oh hey, uh... If you know a good eye man, maybe you could get him to check your vision. Why don't you keep the damn point if it means that much to ya. ( Scoffs ) Hey, I was just kidding! Bernie! What's the matter? Bernie! Bernie. ( Gasps and sobs ) Sometime... Sometimes, in the middle of the night... I wake up and sh... And Shirley's not in the bed. And I walk into felice's room, and there's my wife huddled in the corner. We brought home a beautiful baby girl to raise as our own, and she's degenerating into a human vegetable. Look, Bernie, I don't know if this would help you get the drug or not, but Mary mc geary's one of the best reporters on the paper. I bet she'd write a major story on this. And i--i could do all the photography. Thanks, Freddy, but... Knowing Shirley's state of mind these days, the last thing we need is publicity. All right. If you change your mind, you let me know? I'm sorry, guys, I shouldn't have been on the court tonight. 'Night, Bernie. 'Night, Bernie. ( Sobs ) Catastrophe occurs, and the first question always is "oh god, why me?" The real question is "why not me?" ( Gasps ) It's not "why me?," it's "why her?" I don't know what the purpose of all this is, Bob. But she's an innocent little girl. Adopting her was our mitzvah. A "mitzvah." What's that? Mitzvah means "commandment." With US, it's a commandment. God gives US the opportunity to do good. We adopted felice because Shirley and I believed one of the greatest mitzvahs is to bring up a child that's not your own. ( Gasps ) And we did it. We did it. And now... ( Coughs, sniffs ) But god gave you his afflicted, so how can you fulfill your obligations? What are we supposed to do, Bob? She's dying in front of our eyes. How could god place this child in our hands just to destroy her. Are you crazy? In the middle of a crisis, it's not always made clear to US what we're supposed to do, Bernie, but we must look for god's plan. Sometimes, we may never find it, but we have to look. Some people believe that all they're ever supposed to do is accept. Not me. I don't know how. But she will survive, Bob. She will survive! Dr. Sherrard? Dr. Abrams. Come on in. Have a seat. You sure? Oh, of course. You're not disturbing me, I'm just... Trapped in this damn wheelchair. Sometimes, it gets uncomfortable. But tell me, I want to know how things went for you in Baltimore. Well, we saw Dr. Livingston, and we talked about ketogenic diet. Ah, as I told you, that would have been my recommendation also. That's why I was hoping that you would be available for a consultation, doctor. Why don't you call me Earl. If you call me Bernie. Well, I'm very interested in talking about sodium valproate. Are you familiar with that? Did anyone tell you about the workshop they just had in Washington? No. I have it here somewhere. Last month, representatives from the food and drug administration, St. Paul pharmaceuticals, epilepsy commission came together to talk about sodium valproate. And there were also representatives from the national institute of health and other centers that are testing the drug. See, this drug was developed in Europe. Now, the tests that the fda require are very elaborate. Stringent. Ah, there we are. Now, when I read this transcript, I see all the experts who want this drug approved quickly, and it's clear to me that we are lagging behind the rest of the world in bringing valproate to the marketplace. Why? It takes six years and 50 million bucks to get a new drug approved. Now, this is without getting any return on your investment. That's why St. Paul's is the only company that has shown any interest at all in licensing the drug. See, from a marketing standpoint, there are only 100 to 200,000 children suffering from myoclonic epilepsy. Only? These are not the kinds of numbers needed to justify an investment. An investment. I think that's obscene. Well, we may not like it, but any businessman will tell you that if you wanna stay in business, you gotta turn a profit. And the drug companies will tell ya, and they're not wrong, if they go outta business, there will be no medicine for anybody. Really? Well, I don't accept that. That's the way it is, Bernie. Well, that's not the way it is with me. What about the test centers? What's the largest test center in this country? National institutes of health. Bethesda, Maryland. Well, then that's where we start. Of course. You must be Dr. Abrams. I'm Monroe Keith. Oh, how do you do, Dr. Keith. How do you do. This is my wife Shirley. How do you do, ma'am. And that's our son David and our daughter felice. Hello. My secretary tells me you're quite a persistent individual. I've had to be Dr. Keith, but I do appreciate you seeing US. No problem, sir. I believe you've come to the right place. We have if you can help our daughter. ( Chuckles ) My secretary also said you're not the kind to mince words. Well, your secretary's very patient. Felice is a cutie. Yes, we think so. The exam will take most of the day. Where are you staying? At the colony motel. After the exam, I should know whether she can qualify for a study within 48 hours. I'll call you. Thank you, Dr. Keith. You're welcome, sir. Hey, kiddo, get your bathing suit on. Pronto. Okay? I--i thought we were going sightseeing. Later, first she has to have her swimming exercises, and, besides, I can't leave till Keith calls. ( Exhales ) That means we'll be sitting in here two days in a row. Well, I'm taking the bus to town to see the sights. Uh, just a minute. You're not going anywhere by yourself. Honey, you can stay here. You can watch TV. You can swim. You can read. And practice my haftarah. Right. I could have stayed home and done that. Why did you bring me? We brought you, David, because we're a family. I need your help, honey, now more than ever. And so does your father. Even though he doesn't always show it. Please, David. Thank you. ( Phone rings ) ( Sighs ) ( Phone rings ) Hello? Before we discuss felice's test results, it might be wise to explain what this study of ours is all about. Dr. Keith, with all due respect, I am familiar with the scientific method. Can we just talk about my daughter's treatment? I'm afraid I can't treat her. I don't treat any of the children. You see, I have been given a limited quantity of valproate for the express purpose of testing the drug to see if it's safe and effective. Okay, fine. We can sign some papers, and you can test it on felice. I'm afraid I can't include felice in the study. What do you mean "can't"? These tests are studying seizures of a different type than the ones felice is experiencing. So you're saying this drug can't help her? No, I'm not saying that at all. As a matter of fact, I believe felice would improve with the treatment. Then why can't she be-- knowing that, you refuse to treat her? You have to understand-- despite the fact that you're a medical doctor, you refuse to save my daughter's life? Bernie, please. I'm not even going to dignify that with an answer. That's not what you were saying at all, is it? Of course not. Then what are you saying?! The guidelines for this study are very specific. Dr. Abrams and Mrs. Abrams, you're not the first family who's come to see me, and it's never easy-- Dr. Keith, I too deal with patients, everyday. And I can handle their questions without being evasive. Dr. Abrams, I am perfectly willing to have a rational discussion here, but uh... But a cynical attitude and your emotions won't get you anywhere. Well, what will get me somewhere, doctor? Tell me! Because I read the epilepsy commission report from cover to cover, and you're in there. You're the number one advocate of this drug in the country. And you say it will help her, and yet you won't treat her! We are not here to treat. We are here to test. Treat or test. She needs that drug. She needs it! I am sorry, but felice's myoclonic symptoms do not fit the criteria we have established for our controlled clinical trials. We are working with an extremely limited quantity from the drug company. I don't believe what I'm hearing. I must make sure this drug is safe. Let felice die while you people decide whether she can take the drug that might save her life? That's insane! If I had valproate to distribute, I would gladly give it to your daughter and all the other children free! But I don't. I must make sure my tests are scientifically conducted, and the results approved by the federal drug administration. That's my job. Doctor, our little girl goes into 15 convulsions a day. She's begging US to help her, and we can help her if we can persuade you. You can't persuade me, and I can't let you. A lot of pregnant women who took thalidomide in the '60s gave birth to a deformed child because that drug was not adequately tested before distribution. Felice is not giving birth. She's a six year old having terrible convulsions that are turning her into a vegetable. She's entitled to this drug. We are here fighting for her life. And you are right to do that, sir. If I was in your position, I would do exactly the same thing, but please try and listen to me. Congress has insisted that the fda make sure that any drug that goes on the market be safe and effective. So here in n.I.H., we are trying to see if this drug is safe and effective so that we don't have another thalidomide episode. If I were responsible for releasing this drug to your child, even if I could do that, what would I say to all the other children and their parents? They'd make the same demands, and they'd be right too. And then what would you say if that drug killed them? Or advanced the process of deterioration or had some other unknowable or horrible effect on them? I must stand clear of my own emotions. And yours, Dr. Abrams. So... She'll be left out. Even though the drug worked thousands of times in Europe. Yes. I'm afraid that's true. Many drugs approved abroad are later found to be dangerous, or they don't work. We have to be sure. Speed must come second to safety. I understand you, doctor. And I you, sir. However, there are things you can do. What's that supposed to mean? Well, you're obviously not a man who's afraid to bring pressure to bear. Get your congressman involved. Talk to the newspapers. You'd be surprised what you can accomplish by talking to the media. Talking to the media will not stop the seizures. God of my fathers, teach me how to talk to this man. Please, help US. I beg you. There are two slim possibilities. Your private doctor can apply direct to the fda and the drug company for a small amount for private study under a compassionate use permit. Why didn't you tell me that first instead of-- because it will take time to process, and I don't know if your doctor's qualified to administer the drug. Our doctor is a pediatric neurologist. He may not be qualified according to fda standards, but still it is something you should look into. Time. Time. Felice gets worse every day. Traveling for someone in felice's condition might be more than she could handle, but would you be willing to go abroad for treatment? I've been trying to contact a doctor who wrote an article I read. Uh, Dr. Whalley. But he's based in england, and he doesn't return my calls. Get me Dr. Whalley. I was one of the first people he asked to read his unpublished research. It's ringin'. ( Whispers ) Oh, god. Dr. Sherrard: Listen, I don't care if you're backed up. You don't keep a child in this condition waiting. What? What did you say? Jamie promised me that he was taking his medicine. How did I know he was feeding it to the pigeons. Look, just write "clinic patient" across the top of the form, and give him the c scan. Yes, darling, I'll take the heat. Thank you. What are we going to do with him? He just won't take his pills in front of the other kids. That's why you have to explain to his teachers and everyone else at that school how important it is for him to take his medication twice a day. Otherwise, we're never going to stop these seizures. I understand. Promise me you'll talk to them. Jamie's not going to do it, Mrs. Williams. You have to. I just-- I get so scared. Riley here will take you upstairs, Mrs. Williams. I'll be up in a little while to find out who you want me to talk to. Thank you. Well, hello, Bernie, welcome back. That's so sad. Yeah. Worst part of it is, it's so typical of epileptic children. They get ashamed, Bernie. Over nothin'. Nothin'. ( Phone rings ) Anyhow... How was Maryland? Oh, terrific. Excuse me, Dr. Sherrard, call for you. Thank you. What? Did Keith say she could join his study? Oh, he couldn't do that, but he called a Dr. Whalley in england, and we have an appointment with the British national health service. You got an appointment by phone with whalley? Right. That's one for the record books. Sherrard here? And we're going to england, and you're going with US. ( Sighs ) I'm so sorry. No, no, no. Don't do that, I'll uh... I'll tell the parents. Yes, fine. Bernie, I... I can't just pack up and go. But you can, you're her doctor. Look, you do what you have to do. If you can work it out so she gets to see whalley, fine. He knows the drug inside and out. What's wrong, Earl? Well... Felice is not my only patient who has epileptic seizures. That phone call was about a second generation welfare baby. She's retarded now. She has zero chance in this world, Bernie, because her folks couldn't get their hands on a little valproate. Look, Bernie... I don't wanna rain on your parade, but we're talking about 200,000 children here. 200,000! What am I gonna give them? Band-aids and worry beads? I'll talk to ya. Uh, would you tell Mr. Scally that Mrs. Abrams would be happy to talk to him? No, Mrs. Abrams. Uh, he's not here right now. I expect him within the hour. Uh, just a minute. My husband walked though the door. Hold on, please. Bernie. It's St. Paul's pharmaceuticals. The second time they called today. Hello, this is Dr. Abrams. Uh-huh. Good afternoon, Mr. Scally. We're-- would you be willing to put that in writing? Would you just hold the phone one second please? The company says they'd be willing to help US get a supply of the drug on a compassionate use basis. Bernie... Uh, and when would this arrangement begin? And would it be for as long as we needed it? ( Whispers ) Oh, god. Oh, I can't tell you how wonderful this news is, Mr. Scally. I'm sorry? Could you repeat that? I think that, uh, I'm going to have to call you back. I can't believe it, Bernie. We did it. It's over. We won! Thank god. It takes 30 days. What does? The compassionate use permit. It takes 30 days for the fda to process the application. That's the minimum. And we don't know if felice has that much time. Maybe the drug company can get them to waive the regulation. I don't know. Call them back. Find out. If we take scally's offer, then we'd have to cancel our trip to england. Of course we would. Why would we risk her life when we can get the drug right here? Because there's so many medical questions. I'd like to run it by Earl and see what he thinks. Do you know that the compassionate use permit is only for felice? That's how your compassionate use permit works. It only covers one or two patients. ( Sighs ) Oh, man. You all right? ( Exhales ) This old body and soul is gettin' too old to do all-nighters. ( Groans ) ( Exhales deeply ) Do you think felice can handle a trip to england? I don't know, Bernie. Maybe. But the seizures and what we're trying here aren't doing her any good. Well, then you want US to go? What I want, Bernie, is to have a regional treatment center right here. Then all these children could get what they need right downstairs in the pharmacy. The prospects of the fda approving the request, however, is somewhere between slim and none. Why? Well, for starters, I don't have any hands-on experience with the drug. You could get that in england. Well... You do have a passport? Well, yes, I have a passport, but now come on, Bernie, think this through. There are risks. Both ways to be sure. First, she may not be able to handle the trip to england. And of course, on the other hand, she may not be able to wait the 30 days. Or more. I know. I know. What's the matter, sweetheart? The company's offered to help US get the drug, but... It doesn't... It just doesn't feel right. What about all the other parents and all the other kids? Maybe they don't have the money to fight. Or the connections. Or the energy. Why US? Why was it given to US? That's a question, Bernie. Yeah, but what's the answer? That's also a question, Bernie. But not one for the middle of the night. Come on, come-- Shirley, there are so many other kids that will suffer if they don't get that drug. What are we to do about that, Bernie? We're two people. That's why I can't sleep. If a child loses its mind, isn't it in a sense losing its life? The talmud says that to save a life we can put aside the rigid laws and apply the moral principle. Now is not the time for talmudic discussion. We're exhausted. Shirley, please, I need you to listen to what's in my heart. I can't make this decision on my own. What decision? Is it right to let felice get the drug here and then have a chance at a normal life when all the other children don't have the same chance? Does that seem right to you? Don't you think we have an obligation to do something to try to save the others? Isn't it a mitzvah, Shirley? Maybe the only way to speed things up and get the fda to approve the drug for all the children is if we turn down the offer from the company. Well, wait, let me explain. Number one, I don't think felice can wait 30 days for the paperwork, and what if it takes longer? She's getting worse every day. And number two, because getting the drug is only good for her. Just her. What are you thinking, Bernie? What I'm thinking, Shirley, is the typical American family like US goes outside the country to get it because we have to. But we make sure that everyone in this country knows why we went, and then maybe pressure will build and all the other children will get their chance. To do what? Got to england? Well, we'll just bring some back. That's against the law. Shirley, Freddy told me that the dispatch would write an article about you and I and felice and our problem-- I don't want to talk to the press. Shirley, please listen to me. No, you listen to me this time, Bernie. Do we really want felice to be known as "that girl with the seizures"? I'm sorry. She doesn't need that. We have to talk to them. Fine! You talk to them. Go on. Go ahead. Get interviewed. You don't need me. ( Felice screams and falls ) Call them up. Call the press. Have them bring their cameras in here. Show them, show them. This is what you want them to see, Bernie? ( Moaning ) I think so, Shirley. I think this is exactly what we want them to see. We can take the trip, and we can publicize it. This is what we're supposed to do. I know it. Shirley, my darling, if you don't agree, we'll do it your way. ( Felice moaning ) I was thinking you said after the adoption agency called and said they had a... Healthy baby girl that needed a home. You said she... ( Sniffs ) She must be a gift from god. You still believe that, don't you? With all my heart. Is she strong enough to make the trip to england? According to Earl, maybe not. Call the company, Bernie. Tell them thank you very much, but we're going to england. We have no choice. It is a mitzvah. Okay, and a little closer together, you two. That's great. Okay, now hold fluffer up again. Just between. That's it. ( Camera clicks ) Great. Okay. ( Camera clicks ) And one more, all right. Hold still. ( Camera clicks ) Great. Thanks, kids. Thanks, Shirley. Say goodbye to your wife for me. I will, thank you. Thank you. ( Exhales deeply ) I got some great shots here, Bernie. This stuff's gonna break page one. Terrific. Thanks, Freddy. Stop worrying. I got it all under control. Yeah, okay. All right. ( No audio ) Oh, Bob. Yeah? I know this is pretty short notice, but if you can get away, I've got a plane ticket to england with your name on it. I uh... You're kidding, aren't ya? No, I really need you, Bob. But why? Think of it as part of the divine plan, father. The success of which will require your clerical self. What? What's in your head, Bernie? Patience. Soon all will become clear. Take a deep breath, Bernie. They're all set. You guys all ready? Hmm? Bernie? What, honey? I don't wanna talk to the press. Oh, you don't-- you don't have to talk to the press. Don't worry about that. I want ya-- here, felice, you go sit down over there, sweetheart. David, you sit with felice, okay. I just want you near me, honey. Just sit right there so you can be, okay. All set, Dr. Abrams? Yeah. Dr. Abrams, can you tell US exactly what you hope to accomplish by publicizing this trip to england. Well, uh, one of the things that we hope to accomplish is to, uh... Raise the awareness of the country concerning... What people with epilepsy and their families go through every day of their lives. There are so many myths and misconceptions. With the proper medication, most epileptics can live a... A normal and productive life. But the proper medication isn't available in this country for myoclonic epileptics. Many of the little children who are suffering from terrible convulsions... Like... Look at my daughter, felice. Look at that indignity. How do you walk into a hospital and see kids one year old... With 15 and 20 convulsions a day? There is no man that's human that can't cry. I'm sorry. Well, I don't apologize for crying. I'm crying for the children of america that need this medicine. No, sir, the Abrams family doesn't have any of the medicine. It's not available in the United States. Of course, I'll make sure he gets your message. Yes. That's why he has to leave. I'm his friend, father Bob hunter. Well, I'm going to put you in touch with the epilepsy foundation. Right, uh, well, we're going to Birmingham. Shirley, I know all this publicity makes you nervous and uncomfortable, but I really think we're beginning to make some headway. There's a woman in our driveway. So, who is she? I don't know. She's been pacing out there for 20 minutes. She has kids in the car. Thank you. Kids in the car. Hi. May I help you? Uh, are you the man who was on television last night? ( Laughs ) Yeah, that was me. I drove all the way from connelsville. Well, how can I help you? It's Christopher. He's my baby. He's a fighter, but, uh... The doctors say nothing's going to beat the epilepsy except maybe what you've got. I don't have much money left, but whatever I've got is yours if you could, uh... Spare some of that, uh... Val--uh...valproic. The lord'd sure bless ya. What's your name, dear? Judy wyner. Well, Mrs. Wyner, there's... There's been a-- a mistake. You see, I don't have any of the valproate. That's why we're taking our daughter to england for treatment. I see. I'm sorry, i-- I got it backwards. I'm sorry. Would you like some breakfast? Yes, you-- you've driven a long way. Why don't you let US give you something to eat. I don't wanna put you to any trouble. No trouble. Well, um... Maybe something for the kids. They're going to england. All we're trying to do is raise the general awareness level of what kids with epilepsy and their families go through. I'll give him your message. Aw, thank you. And you got the number for the epilepsy foundation? Thank you very much. ( Baby cries ) Okay, great. Okay, thanks again. Oh lord, Dr. Abrams, what are we all gonna do? The lord gave US this problem because he knows that we're the ones to solve it. Come on. Dolores: I'll give him the message. I'm sure he'll call you before he leaves. Something wrong? Oh, nothing's wrong. Get your jacket. ( Phone rings ) ( Phone rings ) It seems to me you skipped a couple of years while I wasn't watching. Huh? Well, I was going to wait until after your bar mitzvah before we had the official man to man talk, but I think now would be a good time. Dad, you're not gonna talk to me about the birds and the bees are you? I know all about that stuff. ( Laughs ) The news is out, huh? What's so new? Well, we're going to be facing some problems. Yeah, like keeping mom on the plane for nine hours? ( Both laugh ) Yeah, that'll be new. Nine hours. Wow. You excited about england? Yeah. Are you all packed? You know we're leaving in five days. I know. And how's your haftarah portion coming? You memorized yet? I've been memorized for the last four weeks, dad. ( Sighs ) I'm sorry, David. I have neglected you, haven't I? I could have been better for you if I weren't so busy talking about felice everyday. With TV and the papers and all the rest of that. Yeah. But I will tell ya, speaking of that, I really respect your opinion, and I would like to know what you think of what we're doing. You don't have to ask. Shirley: Bernie?! Yeah? What's wrong? What's wrong? The offer from St. Paul's. Is it still good? What do you mean? It's because of all this damn publicity. Someone from Dr. Whalley's office just called. He said the British national health service might cancel felice's appointment if there is any further media exposure. Why? It has something to do with the delicacy of her not being a British subject. God forbid, something should come easy just once! She's having 15 seizures a day. Grand mal seizures! Did you think that she would somehow become immune through all the pressures, Bernie? The phones ringing off the hook all day. All the interviews. A normal person would be having seizures. Isn't there something you can prescribe for her? If I introduce one more drug into that child's body at this stage, it's only just going to make it that much harder for the valproate to take hold. We don't want that. Well, let me tell you something. If she convulses on that plane, you better pull something out of your little black bag, if not for her, then for me. If not for me, then for you. Bernie, I can't go with you. You what? I'm just not physically up to making a trip like that. I don't believe this. How long you've waited to consult with top doctors like whalley and Keith, and now you're backing out? And how will you ever get the feds to designate the hospital as a regional treatment center if you don't pile up some credentials with the drug? Have you any idea... Any idea at all what a nine hour plane ride and a six hour train ride will take out of me? Oh, Earl. Do you know what it's like to live in a body that doesn't work, man! There's not an hour, not a single hour of the day when I feel comfortable. Did you ever stop to think about this from my perspective? Did ya? We are all victims. One way or another, Earl, we're all victims. It's just that sometimes some of US... We find the strength to overcome. Bernie? You stung me. But I figure... The only thing worse than being a victim is... Being a victim who's been left behind. I'm with ya. David: Felice, I don't think there's going to be enough room for all these critters. Felice: Well, I can't leave fluffer. Okay, I'll take fluffer in my suitcase. And Nancy and squeaky, too? All right, but that's it. What about chatter and Felix? Well, you have to leave somebody home to guard the fort. What if I don't come back? Will you watch them for me? Why wouldn't you come back? What's it called where I'm going? Birmingham. It's a city in england, like Columbus is a city in the u.S. I can show you on the globe. Will there be a lot of doctors? Sure, there will be doctors everywhere. But the one who's in Birmingham has some medicine, and dad says it will make you all better. How does he know? Well, it worked with other kids. And why should you be any different? Yeah. Why should I be any different? Daddy? Yes, baby? Am I going to die? In about 100 years. Whalley: Can't think where I left it. Well, that is extraordinary. Somebody's pinched my brolly. Uh, hello. ( Nervous laugh ) Brolly, brolly, brolly. It may seem fine enough now, but in Birmingham, you never know. You suddenly get drenched to the skin without it. Ah, golly. Excuse me, but could you be looking for your umbrella? Ah! Oh good, th-thank you. Oh, well done. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Um, excuse me. Dr. Abrams. Oh! Ah! Good heavens. Oh, welcome. How do you do, Dr. Abrams. Oh, do forgive me. Please come in. Yes, yes. Catching me like this must dent your confidence a bit, what. Oh no, on the contrary, it's a privilege to be here. Oh, not at all. Uh, this is my wife, Shirley. Hello. How do you do. Doctor. And my son, David. Hello. And this is Dr. Earl sherrard. Hello, how are you, sir. And my friend Bob hunt. How do you do. ( Clears throat ) And that's our angel, felice. Ah, felice. Well, felice, you're a brave little girl to journey all this way, aren't you? Hmm? Hmm? What? Yeah, and a very pretty one too if I may say so. Yeah, oh, I do hope all that fuss about the publicity didn't make US seem too cold-hearted. You know, but you see, if--if we were to allow everyone from the states to come here for treatment, then there'd be a stampede, and then we wouldn't be able to help anyone at all. It would completely gum up the works as they say. We're just happy you decided to see US. Ah well, I just hope that we can do the job here and make you all better, hey. Felice, you'd like that wouldn't you, what what what? You talk funny. ( Laughs ) Yes, I do, don't I? ( Laughs ) Are you the doctor with the medicine? Yes, yes I am. I certainly am. I am the doctor with the medicine, yes. And, and since that's what you've come for, no point in wasting a pretty little girl's valuable time with anymore silly chitter-chatter, is there? What what. No, no. Ooh, of course I'll leave this because I can get straight to work. Dr. and Mrs. Abrams, you're welcome to be in the room for the examination if you'd like to. Thank you very much. Yes, good. Come along. ( No audio ) Thank you. Uh, would you please. Won't be long, felice. Yes, uh... She seems quite woozy. Uh, what medication is she having? Clonazepam, methosuximide, um, methabarbitone and mephenytoin. Yes. That's quite a regimen, isn't it? Well, there's only so far you can go with a ketogenic diet. Yes, well I'm sure you will understand, doctor, that before we can introduce the sodium valproate, we'll have to rid her system of all the other drugs. Of course. And I'm afraid that means running the risk of more seizures. Dr. Sherrard warned US about that. Well, now since felice is not a British citizen, I'm afraid we can't admit her to one of our public wards, but, uh, I hope you'll be more comfortable at the inn. Of, we'll be fine. We're in very capable hands. Oh, yes, I'm sure. Yes. ( Moaning ) ( Moaning loudly ) ( No audio ) ( Felice screams ) ( Shivering and moaning ) Whalley: How old is the Christopher wyner baby? Sherrard: Seventeen or eighteen months. Ah, perhaps we can do something about him. Right now, felice, I want you to breathe very hard for me, would you. Yes. Harder. Harder. Hard as you can. ( Exhales ) That's a good girl. Are you so sure you want to watch this? Why? What's going to happen? It's called hyperventilation. The harder she breathes, the more likely she is to have a seizure. But the longer the stopwatch ticks, the better she's getting. ( Heavy breathing ) ( Screams ) ( Moaning ) Not bad. I've got, uh... Oh, yes yes. Here are the prescriptions for the chemist as we discussed. Thank you very much. Um, but be warned now, sodium valproate is a powerful drug, but it's not a miracle cure. There may be side effects. Uh, withdrawal symptoms, weight gain, and occasional nausea. But if there's no allergic reaction, you'll start to see the difference within the month. More important, she'll see the difference. Yes. The car is here. ( Both laugh ) Why are you putting them in my suitcase? Don't worry, the lord works in mysterious ways. Hell, even he couldn't get all this through u.S. Customs, and the law on smuggling is perfectly clear. Clarity depends on the eye of the beholder. That's advice from your optometrist. Look, I still don't understand, Bernie. You said you'd explain, but, come on, what's going on in your head? I mean, you got a fiendish look on your face. Boston. We're going home through Boston. Boston. Why Boston? Because in Boston, what kind of customs inspector would search the suitcase of an Irish priest? ( Snickers ) If--if I go to the slammer, I'm holding you personally responsible. Look, felice practically died for this prescription in the states, and in one day, we're filling up this bag with enough for her, for Christopher wyner, and for an entire year. Now the next step is to get it for all the children. You're doing some beautiful work. It's our house. I know, sweetheart. You're very good. What are you up to, Earl? ( Sighs ) How you feeling? Ah, a little stiff, Bernie. Other than that, I'm okay. What's that? It's an application for the drug administration. Lots of papers. ( Chuckles ) With the questions they're asking here, you would think I was trying to get permission to test a nuclear device instead of becoming a treatment center for an anti-convulsant. Oh, they'd never turn you down. You're one of the first American doctors with hands-on experience with valproate. But being in a midwestern children's hospital doesn't have quite the glamour factor as some of your big ticket hospitals, you know? Really. Well, if they do turn this down, we can always let them know that we are holding a trump card. That's not all we're holding. Lord, you delivered Daniel from the lions, Jonah from the whale, you parted the sea for Moses, I don't need a whole lot. But if you delivered the israelites from pharaoh, please get father hunt and me through customs. Amen, brother. Next! ( Coughs ) Passport, please. Do you have anything to declare? Cigarettes, alcohol, any purchases over $400? ( Coughs ) No. Would you open the suitcases? ( Coughs loudly ) Can I offer you a cough drop, father? ( Wheezing ) Oh, thank you, son. Thank you. You know... ( Coughs ) You remind me of one of me first altar boys. You couldn't be any relation to Carey o'Connor over there in chatham, could you? No, I don't think so. No, of course, you couldn't be. I would have remembered you from the, from the funeral. Aw, he was, he was a fine lookin' lad, and you're the spitting image of him. Here, now let... ( Coughs ) Let me open this devilish case. No, no. That-- that's all right, father. You go right on through. Oh, thank you, my son. ( Coughing ) Take something for that cough now. I will. In fact, I have some medication right here. Uh, use it in good health. We will. ( Coughing ) Next, let me have your passport, please. ( All talking at once ) It isn't often that orthodox Jews or Roman catholic priests or a black paraplegic doctor and a British doctor get together to solve a problem, but it happened. And felice was free of seizures 21 days after she began treatment in england. Christopher wyner also started down the road to recovery. By this time, the fda had been working with the drug company to complete it's testing and make valproate more available under the compassionate use program. And Earl got permission to begin using it on his patients. When a little child is sick, should we ever, ever give up fighting for its life? That's a question. What's the answer? The talmud says, "to save a single human life is to prevent the destruction of the world." Announcer: For more information on epilepsy, write to...
