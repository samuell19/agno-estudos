To Achachan, who told me stories. 1956, CENTRAL TRAVANCORE On the 8th of April, in the year 1955 Four friends named Thoma, Onan, Vijayan and Sojan traveled from Veliyannoor of Kottayam district to Rayappenpetty that lies between Theni and Kambam in Tamil Nadu to witness an unusual ritual that they came to know about. The ritual included choosing a person by lot at the inception of the Easter lent and his subsequent grooming for fifty days before being crucified on Good Friday. However, as they reached the said place, they could only observe a few people praying at the church. Upon inquiring with the parish Vicar, they came to know that even if a ritual like that existed in the past it must have been discontinued a considerable number of years ago and that they now host only a regular Way of the Cross. ♪ They stripped off your ♪ ♪ clothes and insulted you, ♪ ♪ Treated you like a slave ♪ ♪ and humiliated you. ♪ ♪ My Lord, this was because of my misdeeds ♪ ♪ Lord Merciful, ♪ ♪ accept my tears and forgive me. ♪ ♪ Accept my tears and forgive me ♪ ♪ They laid you upon the cross, ♪ ♪ Nailed you upon your bed of death, ♪ ♪ And, endless blood flowed ♪ ♪ out of your wounds. ♪ ♪ My Lord, this was because of my misdeeds, ♪ ♪ Lord Merciful, ♪ ♪ accept my tears and forgive me. ♪ ♪ You bowed your head and gave up your life. ♪ ♪ You left this world with open arms. ♪ So, you are not returning with us, Onan? How long has it been? Been 52 days. Usually I tell the locals how to identify him and ask them to send him home if they spot him. What else can be done? Once, one of my uncles ran away. Who, Narapilla? He was an awesome shooter. Made a lot of money from hunting. If one has enough money to invest, hunting can bring a fortune. Game meat is damn expensive. He used to be completely normal, but came back as a lunatic. He claims that he has seen Lord Hanuman. If he is crazy, how can you believe him? He is in his right mind when he says these things. Actually, he's only been crazy for the past six months. What happened then? He wandered around and reached a Hanuman temple in Andhra and stayed there as a devotee. He fasted for forty days and the next day before sunrise he started chanting, neck deep in the temple pond. Then he saw a light around him and it was Lord Hanuman. That's how it started! They are all faking madness.. The husband of a cousin of mine, abandoned her and the children and ran away. As told by a Tamilian who came to buy cattle, We found him walking around naked in the forest. When the elders dragged him home and gave him a nice thrashing, all his madness vanished. But, Narapilla was never aggressive with other people. In a way, things are easy for them. They don't have to fear anyone or worry about judgements. No responsibilities either. Isn't that what the lord has told us to be like! Look at the birds in the sky. They don’t plant. They don’t harvest. You can't just interpret the holy book the way you like.. Only the wise people know the real meaning of the scriptures. How much ever we try, we cannot take anything with us once we die. Nothing can be hidden from God’s eyes. Doesn’t Narapilla go for hunting trips anymore? He took a break from all that long ago. He is an expert at bow fishing. I saw him doing that at Koottar once. I have gone on a few trips with him for fishing and hunting. That was all a long time back. Not many people go for hunting these days. Kunjoonj used to. But nobody knows the time of his arrival or his return. He is a peculiar guy. He doesn’t talk much. Shooters are all weird, in one way or the other. Once, he went hunting with a partner. And they got into a fight about the profit share. He got angry and cut the other guy’s ear off. An ear, really? It was a guy named Thrappel Sadasivan from Moovattupuzha I think he went back on his word. If he had paid, he could have saved his ear! After informing his sister and her family about the birth of his firstborn, Kora fled to the hills. Overwhelmed with grief, Mariam, the mother of Onan and Kora, Retired from housework. Onan reached high-range looking for his brother. He roamed around for a year farming in leased lands. One Sunday, at Ellakkallu, while returning from the Holy Mass, Onan met Kora who was carrying a bunch of bananas to the market. And forgetting that they were in a public place hugged each other and cried shamelessly for a while. Onan invited Kora to work in his leased pepper garden. Onan planned to return home with Kora after the harvest Are you sure this is Jesus Christ? Do you think I’d hang a picture of Judas Iscariot on my wall? Why does he look black? Kora, Be careful about what you speak. That drunkard Kuttappai made fun of this asking why it is wearing a bindi. I told him to better chant the Angelus. Next day, his son told us he was bitten by a snake on his way from here. Then? The snake was not a venomous one. So, he didn't die. Remember me telling you about a doctor friend? He loves to travel around the world. He brought this icon after his travel to Russia. While shifting from the estate hospital to Cochin. He left this with me. It is a very powerful icon. If one prays before this, he will not fail for sure. Heard that your brother is here. Are you going back home? What am I to do there? One can at least usurp some forest here. Don’t you have a kid there? They are at her father’s house. My mother and my brother’s family are at my place. What about your father? He passed away. Been a long time. Oh, I didn't know that. What happened? He was inside our house when it caught fire. He had asthma and fainted almost immediately. Your mother must have gone through a lot. Were your relatives of any help? Oh, she still complains about all that. You cannot blame her for that. I am not saying it was easy for you. But, you cannot compare losing a husband with losing a father. Even at this age, mother treats me like a kid. I have my own issues to deal with. How much more can I tolerate? That is also true. Not all parents understand this stuff. The day I turned sixty, I gathered all my children. I gave the boys two acres each and Four thousand rupees each to the unmarried girls. Mine and her share will be given to whoever looks after us. Not all parents would have the same level of wisdom. I have decided not to return until I earn something myself. It is not like the old days anymore. It takes at least five to eight people to usurp forest land. You don’t have money to buy some land either. Do you? Kora, I asked for you because I wanted to discuss something. Consult your brother before you give me a final answer. Actually, I have a five-acre plot beside the river, at Thookkupalam. It was kept aside for Eliamma. We don’t farm there anymore and there is no point holding on to it. Including the fifty that you already owe me, Arrange four hundred and the plot is yours. I don’t think brother has any plans to buy land here. He just wants to get back home. One Mister Ravuthar tried to fix a deal and offered me up to three fifty rupees. To tell you the truth, I am interested in handing over the property to someone who belongs to our community. Otherwise, it will not be a good thing for our future generations. These Muslims have already taken over the other side of the river. I thought they should be kept away from this area at least. I will request him. You are his only brother. I am sure he listens to you. You have no clue about his nature. Oh please, I know folks from Uzhavoor. You can ask someone from the older generation. In case you are planning to fool me and run away, I have enough contacts to catch hold of you. Why would I do that!? I am not saying that you would cheat. I have to say what I have to say. Would you like to have some congee? Pour some water, fast. Sister, please don’t go near that, please. Oh my god! Don’t go there. Take that kid away. Come here, Put that fire out. He is still inside. He is not well. Someone help us please. Please rush here. I didn’t have even one cent with me. Being the last game, Soman said, each hand should lay ten rupees. I borrowed some money from Varkey and started the game. And, before anyone could even fold their cards, I won the hand just like that. You meld all the sets in one go? It is not everyday that I get four jokers and four trumps. But when I do, it is one hell of a day. Got ninety rupees from just one game. Got a letter from Mother and Thresya. Why can’t you send a letter home once in a while? Did you borrow any money from Peethambaran? He came home asking for a share of the paddy harvest. Old people may say that drinking alcohol, playing cards, dice games and all that is bad stuff. I don’t agree with that. Even gambling is alright if you do that only now and then. But if one gets addicted to these things, it would destroy his family. Why did he go to our house? He could have just asked me. For that he needs to find you! Did you give him anything? Had you left anything with us? He walked about sixteen miles to reach our place. Mother gave him some coffee. Why are you taking his side now? I am not taking anyone’s side here. But I do think that it is only fair to pay back one’s loans. You could give him my share of the harvest. I gave your share as maintenance to your wife and children, when you went missing. I did all the ploughing, planting, watering, weeding and harvesting all by myself and now you are asking for your share? Grandpa gave half of the rights in the plot to me. You could have given my share on lease. You may do that. I am tired of looking after it all, anyway. Do you want some coffee? I do have the money with me. But I am sure I don’t want to do any gambling or business. We are not going to take anything with us once we die. Even if something happens to me, people shouldn’t say that.. I left my wife and children to starve. Why would you bother about others once you are dead? You wouldn’t understand. If you don't want a partnership, give me four hundred as a loan. Forget four hundred, I wouldn’t give even four rupees. There is another way to earn some easy money. We could go hunting. We just need a few people to bring it down hill. You are the one who knows people around here. How much would I get? Half of the profit once labour-charges are paid. Half of the profit and my labour-charge. We would require a minimum of six to seven people. I will ask Devasya. After we sold off our land there, I am not much in touch with anyone. Sometimes, people would visit me like this, And tell me the news about my homeland. You didn’t tell anything about your family. I have two children. He has one. His wife is at her home for the last one year. It is a disgrace to leave one's wife at her father’s home. You should go home and call her back immediately. How can I go back unless I have earned something? How is Kunjepp doing? He is not active like before. He stopped going out after he got his feet started swelling. Most days, he enjoys a sunbath in the yard. These days, he doesn’t even visit the church. Your ancestors once dunk the priest in the water For starting the Holy Mass before your folks could arrive. Do you know that story? Grandfather has told us before. The rule was that the Mass cannot commence before your folks reached the Church. But, after that incident, the family didn’t do that well. People say that it was the priest's curse. People make such mistakes when they are young. Kunjepp, Itti, what is the name of the other guy? I have forgotten his name. Ousep. Yes, Ousep. These three brothers were the main rowdies of that time. Kunjepp was the unruliest of them all. A terror to every man and woman of that land. He carried a pocket knife with him all the time. Do you know how your grandparents ended up together? No. One day, when returning from the church, she accidentally stepped on a snake. She was standing on it's head. If she lifted her foot, the snake would bite her. When she was standing there in a dilemma Kunjepp came that way. He took the knife out of his pocket and cut the snake’s head off. Once grandpa tried to set grandmother on fire too. But as he turned old, he became a pious man. He spent all the time at the church then. You look a lot like your grandfather! So, did he set her on fire? He filled the pig pen with dry leaves. When he went to get the fire, grandmother ran to the neighbour’s house and hid in their attic. Considering his nature, it is not surprising that he is capable of such things. He was very close to my father. They once planned to start a butcher’s stall together. But, when father started a grocery shop, he had to drop the plan. Still, they used to go for hunting trips occasionally and would hunt at least a deer down. They were such great friends. Siby, bring our gun. What should we pay for rent? Money, or paddy? We have ten sacks of paddy in the store room. And, how can I take money from my own kin? Just do me a favor spare the gaur horns for me. Just the horns? The horns and the head. How are you going to bring it down after shooting? Gotta dry the meat first. We may need six to seven people with us. Who is going to be the shooter? We came to know about someone called Karadikkela in Kallar. He has good aim. You may need to pay him a lot. But, he is worth it. Will ask someone at Kallar. The barrel has a small.... Not a hole, more of a puncture. You just need to get it mended by a good blacksmith. This Outhakkutty’s father Luka was an asshole. He disappeared after taking money from grandfather to buy oxen for the butcher’s stall. We shouldn’t have gone to this guy, then. He wants to fix his gun at our expense. But we already knew what was going on in his mind. I figured that. Leave it. The gun just needs just a bit of repairing. We need to go to a good solderer. That Olassa lost his eye after using a dented gun. ♪ The milled rice is still in the mortar. ♪ ♪ And the baby is crying on the rug. ♪ ♪ My couch knows no luck. ♪ ♪ My guest is in one corner, I am in another. ♪ ♪ My bed is not lucky it seems. ♪ ♪ Fighting the hearth and the pots. ♪ ♪ Fighting the fire and the wicks. ♪ You once sang a song like this. Which song? I don’t remember the song. Do you know when was it? When I was eight and you were three it is after we were scolded or something, We ran away from home. I don’t remember this. You were too small then. What happened then? Our plan was to take a bus from Kottayam. You were fine till we reached Kuravilangad. After that, you started crying asking for mother. Then we had to return. I know what you are trying to say. What? That I wasn't trustworthy even then! If that is what you think about yourself, what can I say? Two glasses of tea, please. Two buns as well. Did you get beaten up for taking the little tot? What? When you eloped with me? Since we grew up without a father, I was grandpa’s pet. He told mom that it was her mistake since she didn’t give us enough to eat. Mother didn’t talk to me for a few days I used to wonder if she was my real mother! You were never a trouble maker though. God has a plan for everyone. Is Kela here? Who is this? We have come to have a word with Kela. He is in the woods. Will be late. Where in the woods? He went to collect honey. I don’t know when is he going to be back. Where are you originally from? Muttar. How come your parents married you off to a faraway land? They didn’t marry me off. Then? Kela used to work for my father. One day, he said that he loves me. My father wouldn’t accept a low-caste Christian. One day Kela asked me if I wanna go with him to high-range. I left with nothing but what I was wearing. Weren’t you afraid of the wild animals here? I didn’t even know what he meant by high-range. I used to trade betel nuts, sometime ago. I have paid a few visits to Muttar during that time. Also, our mother’s house is at Mithrakkari near Muttar. When we were young We used to visit the Muttar church with grandparents. I must have seen you somewhere in Muttar since your face looks so familiar. It was a church dedicated to St. George. But, our patron saint is St. Antony. I will tell Kela about your visit. Where can he find you guys? Do you know one Mister Kunjumon? He used to run a pan-shop. You may not know him. We became acquaintances while I was running the betel nut business. He had a son named Kuruvilakkutty. This Kuruvilakkutty's wife eloped with their labourer. It became the gossip of the village. Eventually, Kuruvilakkutty ate poison out of embarrassment. Why are you telling me all these stories? I thought of telling you since you are from the same place. Ask Kela to meet us at Koodalloor Kuttichettan’s shop. We are staying there. The one who ate poison, did he survive? He died. There was nobody around to save him. It was obvious that he had a painful death. That area was dangerous with wild elephants. Her name was Kamalakshy. With her luscious hair, big eyes and a tiny nose... She was a particular kind of beauty. All the young men of that place would gather beneath her tree house to watch her comb hair. Her luscious locks would touch the ground when she lets it loose from the cabin above. One day, an elephant stood under her tree shack and trumpeted at her. Irritated, she threw boiling rice water on its head. The elephant ran for its life with the burnt head.. But didn’t forget the ordeal. A few days later, while she was combing her hair he caught hold of her locks, pulled her down and stomped her to death. Hey, you. Why can’t you do this at a proper time? If we are going to be late the blacksmith may shut his forge and go home. There is a trick, if you wanna know. Blend burnt coconut shells in water and drink it. You will be fit as a fiddle in no time. I think you should go ahead. I will join. I was walking really fast. So you took the straight road? Just when I reached the cemetery, it disappeared all of a sudden. I still walked forward. After some time, it surfaced again, near Karottu house. Then I saw it rushing towards the pipal tree. Back to the temple? Yes, yes. When I asked a few people about it they told me that ghost raids are common in that area. There is similar stuff happening near our Soman’s house. And at my father's place. It's even further. I will tell you something. When I was small, I had heard stories about a vicious ghost haunting our village. It was a priest from Karunapuram church who finally captured the bad spirit. Sadasivan has hired a Tamilian at his shop. Employing these people is going to be damaging in the long run. Our place has so many of them loitering around, these days. Don’t you remember what happened to our mason Ousep? What happened? The locals thrashed him really bad. The mason’s family employed a Tamilian. He took a few days off, but came back with his friend at night. The plan was to loot after tossing chili powder in everyone’s eyes. Mason’s brother in law was there, which the thief was not aware of. He caught the thief from behind and tied his hands and legs. The next day, the locals thrashed him and broke his legs Even his mother wouldn’t have recognized him. He was seen at Pusharampetty after that. Oh, he went there to fix his legs there. And died after a few months of treatment. Since he was Tamil. Would they treat a Catholic like that? Christians wouldn’t go robbing! That’s very true. If it continues like this, we can't start even tomorrow. Jesus, please don’t betray us. If I knew before, I would have stayed back. My wife is sick. I was scared to walk the road alone. A rabid dog bit Joppan’s mother. Who knows how many other dogs are bitten! She was already quite sick, wasn't she? Yes. One day back at home, a rabid dog got unleashed! I was completely unaware of this since I was at work. That evening, when I was returning home after a few drinks A dog came barking towards me. I seemed like a good breed. The finest dogs would always have three hairs from here. Like this? Yeah. Seems like he is of a good breed. I took it with me since we didn’t have a dog at home. My folks were already worried And my wife lost it completely when she saw the dog with me. She didn’t let me in till I got rid of it. So, she is the man of the house! As if I will let her! But, it is ok to let them wear the pants once in a while. After all, she is a loving woman. At night, she slept only after making sure that I was completely ok. There is a way to keep a woman in her place! You just don’t let them handle finance. Babu is very efficient in this matter. Since he is a martial arts expert, his wife is too scared to try anything. She is a poor thing. So, you practice martial arts? Don’t be fooled by his looks. It had been two months since Devasya’s daughter Clara was ousted from her marital home. Devasya had failed to pay the rest of her dowry. For the same reason, his second daughter Sophie met the mother superior of the parish's Carmelite congregation and informed her that she has got the calling to be a nun. Come, get in. No, no. I don’t want to please don’t. You can use that charcoal there. If it rains again, we are going to be in a soup. I didn’t see a rain bird today. Jesus doesn't need buns. Take what is enough to drink now. There is a stream ahead. Yesterday he was arguing in favour of the thief. But do you think he would have stayed alive even if those people spared him? Five, six months back, I got into a mess. One evening, on the usual way to the town, I came across a new guy there. He was really handsome, fair and well built. He was well mannered and smart as well. Also, he was from one of those old Christian families. Suddenly I got this idea to get him married to a girl from our village. I thought that Varkey’s girl would be a good match for him. So, I took the boy to their place hoping that the boy may like the girl. When we reached there, the girl came out to greet us. We heard a baby crying from inside the house. A baby? Yes. A new born. The girl had given birth a few days back. Oh, you didn’t know that she was already married. Apparently, she was fooled by someone. Anyway, we were already there. So, we just had the tea that they served us and left quietly. It was such an embarrassment. Let us relax for a while. Are you drinking the water all by yourselves? You will spoil your tummies eating all that crap. The seeds of this plant will sprout only during a forest fire. We should split into groups of two and get to work. Need to finish the preparations at the earliest. I don’t mind working with anyone but Kela. Let us put it up here. Do not waste time anymore. Preparations should be done before nightfall. If you need urgent money, there is an easy way. Get married as soon as possible. But my mother says that I am not old enough. All you have to do is to rub your moustache with a burnt matchstick. She wouldn’t even buy me a new piece of cloth, let alone a bride. Do you know our Lukachan’s younger daughter? I brought her a proposal from Kothamangalam. But they will marry her off only to a local boy since they want her to stay near them. There is a stream down there. I am sure it is going to take us two trips up and down. We should have taken at least two or three more people with us. And, if the gaur is a huge one even the dried meat would weigh a lot. Also, all this stuff need to be carried down as well. But this is not something we can announce in public. You are talking without thinking twice. There would be a lot of issues if people come to know. The one whom I mentioned to you about If he was here, he would've carried half of the meat himself. But it was you who said that he cannot be trusted. That is not what I meant. I just mentioned that he is like a woman when it comes to keeping secrets. Isn’t that exactly what I said. I was not insisting that we should have gotten him. It would've been just better to bring a few more people. Devasya, Let it go. We will dry as much meat as we can and sell. One of us will watch the meat and take the rest the next morning. What nonsense are you talking? It takes an entire day to reach Panikkankudy. And lack of sleep on top of that. I can’t walk this distance all over again. Then, you can guard the site at night. I can't even run for my life if a wolf or an elephant comes. I hope you will be equally tired when we cut the profit. When old leaves fall, young leaves laugh! Nobody forced you into this. Kora had clearly mentioned that people should come with us only if they are really eager. Onan, you think that you control everything. It is just a dream. When people do things together you should consider everyone's opinion. This is not an enterprise run by you, your brother, father and mother! Don't you fucking talk to me like that. Thommy. What happened to you? Hey, what happened? He was lying unconscious. Must be the sun. Give him some water. The heat is unbearable. You should've been more careful while eating random shit. Food is almost ready. Have it when it is still warm. We should butcher it on the spot. Immediately after the meat is hung we should start smoking it. Only one of us need to be awake at a time. After two hours the next guy can keep the embers burning That way, everybody can catch some sleep. But, be quick to wake up once we start the work. Thommy and I will stay back. Make sure you keep an eye on the fire. It is a little foggy. Otherwise, it will be a huge task to relight the fire. I will sleep in the cave. We will keep the firebrands glowing. I am going alone. What? I am used to going alone. That is not going to happen! It is difficult to shoot with a crowd around. Either I or Kora will come along. If you go alone and something happens to you I will be held responsible. I was being decent with you so far. Don't tell me how to do my job. Brother! Let him do the way he is used to. How dare you talk like that? What if he ditches us and never returns? Do one thing. You go and the shoot it yourself. It is not like I am dying to do this for you. Why are you getting worked up about his rumblings? He is the only one who knows the job. So, Everyone is together on this. It is better not to distract him. We just need to get the work done! Jesus the Nazarene, the king of Jews protect me and my family from sudden and unnatural death thunder and lightening, and, the fire. Amen. So, even the grandpa has left? He left in the wee hours of the night. Didn’t they consider leaving the woman here? Yeah, right. Ammachi is never gonna allow all that. Ok. Are you planning to leave by any chance? My my! Even if I have to sacrifice my own life I will continue to stay here. That’s all I wanted to hear. Today, you should go to the post office and mail a letter. His response must have arrived as well. Yesterday, I had this dream that Varkey came running to me with a letter. So, there will definitely be a letter today. I am sure it was just a dream. There is no use of rushing there other than wearing my knees out. No, dear. I am sure the letter has come today. Once you get the letter to me I will gift you one whole rupee. You and your false promises. What did I get for the last letter I brought! How did you lay your hands on that letter? That’s a big story. I trusted when you told me that you would pay me. After trying for a long time I managed to wake the postman up. He hissed at me asking why I am so jobless and rushed out. There was a heap of letters lying on the table and I remembered the money that you promised me. So I took a big one from the pile and ran. I ran so much and so fast that I stopped only after an hour. That’s how I managed to return so fast. Aha, superb. That was an order for Parvathyar. She is still running around over this. You should return the letter right now. You shouldn’t force me into doing this. I won't. If I go there with it They would catch hold of me and throw me into the jail. Who in their right minds would return stolen goods? You are way too innocent for this world. Ok, then don’t go straight away. You can take another letter along with that. But, you should go without delay... Let me check the time. Wait, there are at least four hours till dawn. Four hours? The rooster had crowed long back. That'd be a midnight rooster! Yesterday, I reached the post office way too early. And, I had to curl up in a corner shivering and shaking like a dog. Today, you don’t have to sleep in the mist or on the ground. You may take this blanket with you. Don't expect me to.. You don't have to, If you bring me a letter today, you can keep it. Right, right. I will definitely bring one today. What about the rupee? Will give you the rupee too. Now, don’t go back on your word. Blanket, a rupee and four pennis. You have my word, I told you. But, don’t steal someone else’s letter, like before. You want Ouseppachan’s letter itself? What else have I been telling you all this while. That will be really difficult. I wouldn't be able to go to Trivandrum! Very smart of you! You don’t want to give me this blanket! I thought I could keep this one. You have wasted a lot of time already. You should start now. Keep me some rice gruel for me, please. I will. You can eat my share too. Does that make you happy? No way. You have your food my dear. Otherwise, you will be left with an empty stomach. I don’t want anything. Give me the letter. I will be back in a minute. Oh the love of my life My dear lord, Send me a response to this letter at least. Why do you make me suffer like this? Have I ever acted against your wishes? ♪ Oh my beloved, ♪ ♪ Tell me what my sins are. ♪ ♪ For, I don’t know them. ♪ ♪ The mistakes that I committed unknowingly ♪ ♪ My dear ♪ ♪ Are costing me everything. ♪ ♪ You know that I have no one. ♪ ♪ That I am an orphan. ♪ ♪ Don’t you? ♪ ♪ You give me a share of your wrath. ♪ ♪ Who can I convey my grief to? ♪ ♪ What is your reply to this question? ♪ ♪ You are a sea of kindness, my beloved. ♪ ♪ Don’t ignore my tears, my precious. ♪ ♪ Oh the love of my life ♪ ♪ Have I done something wrong? ♪ ♪ I have no clue. ♪ My dearest Annakkutty You must be really angry with me. No husband should behave the way I did. To be honest, Near the time of your delivery I could not handle mother’s ruthlessness and brother’s overbearing ways. I stayed away for a few weeks to cool myself down. I never expected to be gone for so long. I thought about coming back But, I was ashamed to confront you. I know that it was so stupid of me. I have to finish running a few more errands. After that, I am going to rush to you. Have a lot of stories to tell you. To you and little Lukachan With love, your Darling. Who is that? What happened? Kora, please rush. Thommy, bring two wooden poles, fast. What happened brother? The gaur gored him. Babu, hold tight. Thommy, carry only whatever is necessary. Don’t forget water. Hurry. For a big wound like this, we shouldn't be carrying him this way. Rush here. Four angels will save me. Mary’s scapular will save me. At nightfall, I will read the holy book. Carrying the heaviest of crosses Climbing the steepest of mountains, Kneeling in front of the mother of the Orslem church. Our patrons Varghese Varghese and the apostles Peter and Paul Saved the fire and the horse in the kingdom of paradise. Save us the same way. Mariam Margarita. Blessed Kandeesha. Once we are in deep slumber. Save our souls from the evil spirit. Our good lord. Amen. It is a miracle that he has escaped the gaur. Told you not to commit deeds against Christ! Have you read the Book of Jonah? He went ahead with a group of people on a voyage against the wishes of the lord. After a few hours, they got caught in huge tempest. The captain knew that they were being punished for the sins of one among them. When they cast lots, Jonah’s name came up. So, they threw him into the sea. One should learn to be straight forward. Some rascals would talk only in parables. I was not stabbed by the gaur. I went to the Beer Rao range... That’s where they come in groups to graze. I aimed the gun at a huge one. But it hit him in the wrong spot and it dashed away from the gang. I followed the blood stains on the ground. I knew that it would be hiding somewhere close. I miscalculated its position. The gaur was waiting in the bushes, right in front of me. Realizing that I had no time to fire a shot, I laid on the ground. Otherwise, it would have disemboweled me. Even then, it charged at me with its horns, twice or thrice before stomping hard on my back. Also, it stepped on the gun. The gun broke into two pieces. I somehow managed to walk until here, with the help of a stick. Is it hurting here? Here? Yes. Are any of his relatives present here? We are from the same place. So, he slipped and got hurt? He was on the way to his in-law’s It was too dark, he didn’t notice the slippery rock. What stump did you say you fell on? A coffee stump. If you walk another seven miles from here, there is a hospital. How is it possible, sir? By the time we reach there, he will bleed to death. I don’t know about that. Sir? Is there a lack of facilities here? There is no such issue here. I think he is afraid that we will scoot without paying the dues. Tell him that we needs to hear. We can’t abandon the guy! What is the real problem, doctor? See, I won’t start the treatment until you tell me the truth. We were scared that you would report us to the police. He got stomped by a gaur. A wild gaur? You went for illegal logging? No, poaching. Sadanandan, come here. It is a criminal offense. We will have to file a case. Who is the gang leader? Are you all deaf? I am the one who took everyone there. You, come here. What is your name? Onan. Father’s name? Chacko. The first accused, Onan Chacko. What is your house name? Please don't file a case, sir. I have two small kids to look after. Do you know the meaning of the term ‘police’? We were neck deep in debt. I made a mistake. Answer my question. No. Police are the guardians of the law. Those who enforce the law. Don't I have to do my job? If a person commits a mistake, he needs to pay for it. Kela’s back is torn! Kela is suffering for his faults. How is it fair that he alone should pay for the mistakes of all of you? What is it, brother? What is your name? Were you asked for? Is this yours? Possession of deadly weapons makes for another case. Please don’t make this a court-case! We will do whatever is necessary. Onan, Shouldn't have you been more careful? If you gave it a thought beforehand, your friend wouldn't have had to go through all this. After spending his entire earnings from farming on Kela’s treatment and bribing the police Onan descended the hills along with Kora. They agreed to work for Outhakkutty to pay off the gun's price ..for the next six months. But, as usual, the indecisive Kora joined a group of loggers from Thrissur and responsibilities fell solely on Onan’s shoulders again. After a few years, discussions on land reformations began and in the subsequent migrations Onan and Kora settled in another part of the high-range with their respective families. ♪ Carrying the yoke, the stick and the bag ♪ ♪ We crossed the river Periyar ♪ ♪ Towards the land of elephants and leopards ♪ ♪ Just like black pepper vines ♪ ♪ Spreading on the mountains ♪ ♪ Her smile ♪ ♪ And the arrival of the firstborn ♪ ♪ Have sought to stop me ♪ ♪ Until the last minute ♪ ♪ In the church of Kantheeshangal ♪ ♪ I am comforted that I have a cemetery plot ♪ ♪ In the soil where rests ♪ ♪ our roots and my ancestors ♪ ♪ We cried a river, before leaving. ♪ ♪ Dragging our hearts and ♪ ♪ bodies with great effort ♪ ♪ We have come to seek the fruits of the wild ♪ ♪ We have in our way, the horn, the knife ♪ ♪ The thunder, the storm ♪ ♪ Hunger, battles ♪ ♪ Sickness and the rains ♪ ♪ We have no rice, raw or flattened ♪ ♪ We know no help from the almighty ♪ ♪ Except acres of wilderness ahead of us. ♪
